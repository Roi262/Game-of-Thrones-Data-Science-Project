A demon? A conjurors trick? I dont know But the sorcerer called and a voice answered And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess A symbolic revenge of sorts","['Tyrion Lannister', 'Lord Varys']"
