244;00:18:55,740;00:18:57,449;We still have
244;00:18:55,740;00:18:57,449;a wall between us
244;00:18:55,740;00:18:57,449;and the Night King.
245;00:18:57,450;00:18:59,279;There's nothing
245;00:18:57,450;00:18:59,279;between us and Cersei.
246;00:18:59,280;00:19:02,199;There's a thousand miles
246;00:18:59,280;00:19:02,199;between us and Cersei.
247;00:19:02,200;00:19:04,989;Winter is here.
247;00:19:02,200;00:19:04,989;The Lannisters are
247;00:19:02,200;00:19:04,989;a southern army.
248;00:19:04,990;00:19:06,449;They've never ranged
248;00:19:04,990;00:19:06,449;this far north.
249;00:19:06,450;00:19:09,779;You're the military man,
249;00:19:06,450;00:19:09,779;but I know her.
250;00:19:09,780;00:19:13,109;If you're her enemy,
250;00:19:09,780;00:19:13,109;she'll never stop until
250;00:19:09,780;00:19:13,109;she's destroyed you.
251;00:19:13,110;00:19:16,280;Everyone who's
251;00:19:13,110;00:19:16,280;ever crossed her,
251;00:19:13,110;00:19:16,280;she's found a way to murder.
252;00:19:19,360;00:19:21,450;You almost sound
252;00:19:19,360;00:19:21,450;as if you admire her.
253;00:19:25,070;00:19:27,280;I learned a great deal from her.
254;00:20:04,160;00:20:05,989;What is this?
255;00:20:05,990;00:20:08,659;It's what we've been
255;00:20:05,990;00:20:08,659;waiting for our whole lives.
256;00:20:08,660;00:20:11,449;It's what Father trained us for,
256;00:20:08,660;00:20:11,449;whether he knew it or not.
257;00:20:11,450;00:20:12,949;He knew it.
258;00:20:12,950;00:20:14,909;Made me memorize
258;00:20:12,950;00:20:14,909;every damn city, town,
259;00:20:14,910;00:20:16,489;lake, forest, and mountain.
260;00:20:16,490;00:20:18,660;It's ours now.
260;00:20:16,490;00:20:18,660;We just have to take it.
261;00:20:20,200;00:20:22,529;You've been quiet
261;00:20:20,200;00:20:22,529;since you came home.
262;00:20:22,530;00:20:23,989;Are you angry with me?
263;00:20:23,990;00:20:26,240;No, not angry.
264;00:20:27,360;00:20:28,360;Are you afraid of me?
265;00:20:30,360;00:20:31,490;Should I be?
266;00:20:35,280;00:20:39,199;Daenerys Targaryen
266;00:20:35,280;00:20:39,199;has chosen Tyrion
266;00:20:35,280;00:20:39,199;to be her Hand.
267;00:20:39,200;00:20:41,989;Right now, they're sailing
267;00:20:39,200;00:20:41,989;across the Narrow Sea,
268;00:20:41,990;00:20:44,989;hoping to take back
268;00:20:41,990;00:20:44,989;her father's throne.
269;00:20:44,990;00:20:47,409;Our little brother,
270;00:20:47,410;00:20:49,569;the one you love so much,
271;00:20:49,570;00:20:51,409;the one you set free,
272;00:20:51,410;00:20:54,699;the one who
272;00:20:51,410;00:20:54,699;murdered our father
272;00:20:51,410;00:20:54,699;and our first-born son,
273;00:20:54,700;00:20:58,030;now he stands
273;00:20:54,700;00:20:58,030;beside our enemies
273;00:20:54,700;00:20:58,030;and gives them counsel.
274;00:21:01,740;00:21:05,739;He's out there somewhere
274;00:21:01,740;00:21:05,739;at the head of an armada.
275;00:21:05,740;00:21:07,450;Where will they land?
276;00:21:10,240;00:21:11,569;Dragonstone.
277;00:21:11,570;00:21:14,359;They have
277;00:21:11,570;00:21:14,359;deep-water ports
277;00:21:11,570;00:21:14,359;for the ships.
278;00:21:14,360;00:21:16,359;Stannis left
278;00:21:14,360;00:21:16,359;the castle unoccupied,
279;00:21:16,360;00:21:17,819;and that's where she was born.
280;00:21:17,820;00:21:20,109;Enemies to the east.
281;00:21:20,110;00:21:21,909;Enemies to the south--
282;00:21:21,910;00:21:24,909;Ellaria Sand
282;00:21:21,910;00:21:24,909;and her brood of bitches.
283;00:21:24,910;00:21:26,739;Enemies to the west--
284;00:21:26,740;00:21:28,569;Olenna, the old cunt.
285;00:21:28,570;00:21:31,779;Another traitor.
286;00:21:31,780;00:21:33,949;Enemies to the north.
287;00:21:33,950;00:21:37,069;Ned Stark's bastard has been
287;00:21:33,950;00:21:37,069;named King in the North
288;00:21:37,070;00:21:40,069;and that murdering whore
288;00:21:37,070;00:21:40,069;Sansa stands beside him.
289;00:21:40,070;00:21:42,739;Enemies everywhere.
289;00:21:40,070;00:21:42,739;We're surrounded by traitors.
290;00:21:42,740;00:21:44,449;You're in command
290;00:21:42,740;00:21:44,449;of the Lannister army now.
291;00:21:44,450;00:21:47,569;How do we proceed?
291;00:21:44,450;00:21:47,569;Winter is here.
292;00:21:47,570;00:21:50,859;We can't win a war
292;00:21:47,570;00:21:50,859;if we can't feed our men
292;00:21:47,570;00:21:50,859;and our horses.
293;00:21:50,860;00:21:55,029;The Tyrells have the grain,
293;00:21:50,860;00:21:55,029;the Tyrells have the livestock.
294;00:21:55,030;00:21:57,069;Will the Tyrell bannermen
294;00:21:55,030;00:21:57,069;stand alongside
295;00:21:57,070;00:22:00,359;a Dothraki horde
295;00:21:57,070;00:22:00,359;and Unsullied slave soldiers?
296;00:22:00,360;00:22:03,029;If they think Daenerys will win.
297;00:22:03,030;00:22:04,989;No one wants to fight
297;00:22:03,030;00:22:04,989;on the losing side.
298;00:22:04,990;00:22:08,110;Right now,
298;00:22:04,990;00:22:08,110;we look like
298;00:22:04,990;00:22:08,110;the losing side.
299;00:22:09,410;00:22:11,239;I'm the Queen
299;00:22:09,410;00:22:11,239;of the Seven Kingdoms.
300;00:22:11,240;00:22:13,989;Three kingdoms, at best.
301;00:22:13,990;00:22:16,529;I'm not sure you understand
301;00:22:13,990;00:22:16,529;how much danger we're in.
302;00:22:16,530;00:22:18,319;I understand we're
302;00:22:16,530;00:22:18,319;in a war for survival.
303;00:22:18,320;00:22:21,359;I understand whoever loses dies.
304;00:22:21,360;00:22:23,659;I understand whoever wins
304;00:22:21,360;00:22:23,659;could launch a dynasty
305;00:22:23,660;00:22:25,239;that lasts a thousand years.
306;00:22:25,240;00:22:27,819;A dynasty for whom?
307;00:22:27,820;00:22:30,819;Our children are dead.
308;00:22:30,820;00:22:32,279;We're the last of us.
309;00:22:32,280;00:22:34,320;A dynasty for us, then.
310;00:22:37,490;00:22:39,030;We never talked about Tommen.
311;00:22:42,030;00:22:43,989;There's nothing to say.
312;00:22:43,990;00:22:45,949;Our baby boy killed himself.
313;00:22:45,950;00:22:47,489;He betrayed me.
314;00:22:47,490;00:22:48,989;He betrayed us both.
315;00:22:48,990;00:22:50,819;Should we spend our days
315;00:22:48,990;00:22:50,819;mourning the dead--
316;00:22:50,820;00:22:52,239;mother, father,
316;00:22:50,820;00:22:52,239;and all our children?
317;00:22:52,240;00:22:54,819;Cersei--
317;00:22:52,240;00:22:54,819;I loved them. I did.
318;00:22:54,820;00:22:58,029;But they're ashes now
318;00:22:54,820;00:22:58,029;and we're still flesh
318;00:22:54,820;00:22:58,029;and blood.
319;00:22:58,030;00:23:01,030;We're the last Lannisters,
319;00:22:58,030;00:23:01,030;the last ones who count.
320;00:23:06,860;00:23:09,529;Even Lannisters can't
320;00:23:06,860;00:23:09,529;survive without allies.
321;00:23:09,530;00:23:12,699;Where are our allies now?
322;00:23:12,700;00:23:14,909;You saw what happened
322;00:23:12,700;00:23:14,909;to Walder Frey and
322;00:23:12,700;00:23:14,909;his family.
323;00:23:14,910;00:23:16,569;I heard.
324;00:23:16,570;00:23:19,109;How could we ever trust
324;00:23:16,570;00:23:19,109;a man like that?
324;00:23:16,570;00:23:19,109;We couldn't.
325;00:23:19,110;00:23:21,109;He was a useless, old coward,
326;00:23:21,110;00:23:22,949;but the Freys supported us.
327;00:23:22,950;00:23:24,319;Now they're all dead.
328;00:23:24,320;00:23:26,029;Whoever killed them
328;00:23:24,320;00:23:26,029;is no friend of ours.
329;00:23:26,030;00:23:27,569;We need allies.
330;00:23:27,570;00:23:29,359;Stronger, better allies.
331;00:23:29,360;00:23:31,490;We can't win this war alone.
332;00:23:33,490;00:23:37,110;You think I listened
332;00:23:33,490;00:23:37,110;to Father for 40 years
332;00:23:33,490;00:23:37,110;and learned nothing?
333;00:23:41,990;00:23:44,530;( seagulls screeching )
334;00:24:14,110;00:24:15,609;Jaime:
334;00:24:14,110;00:24:15,609;The Greyjoys?
335;00:24:15,610;00:24:18,199;You invited the Greyjoys
335;00:24:15,610;00:24:18,199;to King's Landing?
336;00:24:18,200;00:24:21,029;Not all of them.
336;00:24:18,200;00:24:21,029;Well, it looks like
336;00:24:18,200;00:24:21,029;all of them.
337;00:24:21,030;00:24:22,609;I invited Euron Greyjoy,
338;00:24:22,610;00:24:25,109;the new King
338;00:24:22,610;00:24:25,109;of the Iron Islands.
339;00:24:25,110;00:24:27,819;You said yourself
339;00:24:25,110;00:24:27,819;we needed stronger,
339;00:24:25,110;00:24:27,819;better allies.
340;00:24:27,820;00:24:30,949;There you are.
340;00:24:27,820;00:24:30,949;How are they better allies?
341;00:24:30,950;00:24:33,359;How are they different
341;00:24:30,950;00:24:33,359;from the Freys?
342;00:24:33,360;00:24:34,949;They both broke their promises
343;00:24:34,950;00:24:37,239;and murdered
343;00:24:34,950;00:24:37,239;their former friends
343;00:24:34,950;00:24:37,239;as soon as it suited them.
344;00:24:37,240;00:24:40,239;So does everyone
344;00:24:37,240;00:24:40,239;when it suits them.
345;00:24:40,240;00:24:42,859;Unlike the Freys,
345;00:24:40,240;00:24:42,859;they have ships.
346;00:24:42,860;00:24:45,489;And they're good at killing.
346;00:24:42,860;00:24:45,489;They're not good at anything.
347;00:24:45,490;00:24:48,909;I know the ironborn.
347;00:24:45,490;00:24:48,909;They're bitter, angry
347;00:24:45,490;00:24:48,909;little people.
348;00:24:48,910;00:24:52,109;All they know how to do
348;00:24:48,910;00:24:52,109;is steal things they can't
348;00:24:48,910;00:24:52,109;build or grow themselves.
349;00:24:52,110;00:24:54,239;Euron Greyjoy didn't
349;00:24:52,110;00:24:54,239;come here for that.
350;00:24:54,240;00:24:56,279;Oh, what did
350;00:24:54,240;00:24:56,279;he come here for, then?
351;00:24:56,280;00:24:57,950;A queen.
352;00:25:10,660;00:25:13,859;Euron:
352;00:25:10,660;00:25:13,859;The moment I was chosen
352;00:25:10,660;00:25:13,859;Lord of the Iron Islands,
353;00:25:13,860;00:25:16,239;they turned on me.
353;00:25:13,860;00:25:16,239;( chuckles )
354;00:25:16,240;00:25:17,489;Their own uncle.
355;00:25:17,490;00:25:20,109;They stole
355;00:25:17,490;00:25:20,109;my best ships and ran.
356;00:25:20,110;00:25:22,279;Sailed them
356;00:25:20,110;00:25:22,279;right across the world
357;00:25:22,280;00:25:24,569;and gave them
357;00:25:22,280;00:25:24,569;to the Dragon Queen
358;00:25:24,570;00:25:28,029;so she could bring
358;00:25:24,570;00:25:28,029;her armies here
358;00:25:24,570;00:25:28,029;to attack you.
359;00:25:28,030;00:25:31,489;It's nothing compared
359;00:25:28,030;00:25:31,489;to the treason you suffered
360;00:25:31,490;00:25:35,159;at the hands
360;00:25:31,490;00:25:35,159;of a family member,
360;00:25:31,490;00:25:35,159;from what I hear.
361;00:25:35,160;00:25:37,860;But still, it bothers me.
362;00:25:39,490;00:25:42,529;Murdering them would
362;00:25:39,490;00:25:42,529;make me feel a lot better.
363;00:25:42,530;00:25:46,699;And since it appears
363;00:25:42,530;00:25:46,699;that all our treasonous
363;00:25:42,530;00:25:46,699;family members
364;00:25:46,700;00:25:48,609;are fighting for the same side,
365;00:25:48,610;00:25:51,159;I thought we rightful monarchs
366;00:25:51,160;00:25:53,740;could murder them together.
367;00:25:59,740;00:26:02,530;You're not
367;00:25:59,740;00:26:02,530;a rightful monarch,
367;00:25:59,740;00:26:02,530;though, are you?
368;00:26:06,660;00:26:09,659;The Greyjoys
368;00:26:06,660;00:26:09,659;rebelled against the throne
368;00:26:06,660;00:26:09,659;for the right to be monarchs,
369;00:26:09,660;00:26:13,699;but as I recall,
369;00:26:09,660;00:26:13,699;you were soundly defeated.
370;00:26:13,700;00:26:15,529;Come to mention it,
371;00:26:15,530;00:26:17,909;weren't you the one
371;00:26:15,530;00:26:17,909;who started that rebellion
372;00:26:17,910;00:26:22,109;by sailing to Casterly Rock
372;00:26:17,910;00:26:22,109;and burning the Lannister fleet?
373;00:26:22,110;00:26:23,819;You certainly caught us there.
374;00:26:23,820;00:26:26,659;Very smart move on your part.
375;00:26:26,660;00:26:30,909;Of course,
375;00:26:26,660;00:26:30,909;we all made it to
375;00:26:26,660;00:26:30,909;the Iron Islands anyway.
376;00:26:30,910;00:26:32,109;I was there.
377;00:26:32,110;00:26:33,949;I remember very well.
378;00:26:33,950;00:26:35,489;I saw you.
379;00:26:35,490;00:26:37,779;I heard so much talk.
380;00:26:37,780;00:26:41,409;The best in the world.
380;00:26:37,780;00:26:41,409;No one can stop him.
381;00:26:41,410;00:26:43,109;I didn't believe it,
381;00:26:41,410;00:26:43,109;to be honest.
382;00:26:43,110;00:26:46,409;But I must say
382;00:26:43,110;00:26:46,409;when you rushed
382;00:26:43,110;00:26:46,409;through the breach
383;00:26:46,410;00:26:48,570;and started
383;00:26:46,410;00:26:48,570;cutting people down...
384;00:26:52,070;00:26:53,779;it was glorious.
385;00:26:53,780;00:26:55,199;Like a dance.
386;00:26:55,200;00:26:58,409;The people
386;00:26:55,200;00:26:58,409;I was cutting down
386;00:26:55,200;00:26:58,409;were your own kin.
387;00:26:58,410;00:27:00,739;The place was getting crowded.
388;00:27:00,740;00:27:03,319;I enjoyed watching it.
388;00:27:00,740;00:27:03,319;I truly did.
389;00:27:03,320;00:27:05,529;And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
390;00:27:05,530;00:27:07,989;A good thing for me.
391;00:27:07,990;00:27:11,609;If you hadn't crushed us,
391;00:27:07,990;00:27:11,609;I wouldn't have gone
391;00:27:07,990;00:27:11,609;into exile.
392;00:27:11,610;00:27:13,529;If I hadn't done that,
393;00:27:13,530;00:27:17,110;I wouldn't be
393;00:27:13,530;00:27:17,110;the greatest captain
393;00:27:13,530;00:27:17,110;on the 14 seas.
394;00:27:18,160;00:27:19,990;If not the most humble.
395;00:27:21,280;00:27:22,280;You're not humble.
396;00:27:24,240;00:27:26,240;You're the queen
396;00:27:24,240;00:27:26,240;of a great nation.
397;00:27:27,530;00:27:29,199;You don't care about
397;00:27:27,530;00:27:29,199;the Iron Islands.
398;00:27:29,200;00:27:33,859;They're nothing but rocks
398;00:27:29,200;00:27:33,859;and bird shit and--
399;00:27:33,860;00:27:36,739;and a lot of very
399;00:27:33,860;00:27:36,739;unattractive people.
400;00:27:36,740;00:27:39,359;The Iron Fleet,
400;00:27:36,740;00:27:39,359;on the other hand,
401;00:27:39,360;00:27:42,489;that's something else entirely.
402;00:27:42,490;00:27:45,779;It's the greatest armada
402;00:27:42,490;00:27:45,779;Westeros has ever seen.
403;00:27:45,780;00:27:50,359;With the Iron Fleet,
403;00:27:45,780;00:27:50,359;you own the seas.
404;00:27:50,360;00:27:53,199;You can defeat
404;00:27:50,360;00:27:53,199;the invaders of the east
405;00:27:53,200;00:27:56,159;and the pretenders
405;00:27:53,200;00:27:56,159;of the north and south.
406;00:27:56,160;00:27:57,780;What do you want in return?
407;00:27:59,860;00:28:02,909;Ever since I was a little boy,
408;00:28:02,910;00:28:04,819;I wanted to grow up and marry
409;00:28:04,820;00:28:06,949;the most beautiful woman
409;00:28:04,820;00:28:06,949;in the world.
410;00:28:06,950;00:28:09,659;So here I am,
411;00:28:09,660;00:28:12,109;with a thousand ships
412;00:28:12,110;00:28:13,660;and two good hands.
413;00:28:19,070;00:28:20,660;I decline your proposal.
414;00:28:23,160;00:28:24,199;Why?
415;00:28:24,200;00:28:25,860;You're not trustworthy.
416;00:28:27,280;00:28:29,359;You've broken promises
416;00:28:27,280;00:28:29,359;to allies before
417;00:28:29,360;00:28:31,819;and murdered them
417;00:28:29,360;00:28:31,819;at the nearest opportunity.
418;00:28:31,820;00:28:33,360;You murdered your own brother.
419;00:28:34,700;00:28:37,029;You should try it.
419;00:28:34,700;00:28:37,029;Feels wonderful.

421;00:28:38,660;00:28:40,699;I don't expect you
421;00:28:38,660;00:28:40,699;to trust me outright.
422;00:28:40,700;00:28:43,069;You need proof
422;00:28:40,700;00:28:43,069;of my honest intentions.
423;00:28:43,070;00:28:44,529;In my experience,
424;00:28:44,530;00:28:47,529;the surest way
424;00:28:44,530;00:28:47,529;to a woman's heart
424;00:28:44,530;00:28:47,529;is with a gift.
425;00:28:47,530;00:28:49,819;A priceless gift.
426;00:28:49,820;00:28:51,699;I won't return to King's Landing
427;00:28:51,700;00:28:53,740;until I have that for you.

448;00:31:59,740;00:32:02,569;Ah, Maester Weyland.

449;00:32:02,570;00:32:06,070;A drinker's liver
449;00:32:02,570;00:32:06,070;if ever I saw one.
450;00:32:07,320;00:32:08,320;Weigh that.
451;00:32:09,490;00:32:12,779;The triumph
451;00:32:09,490;00:32:12,779;of transitory pleasures.
452;00:32:12,780;00:32:14,699;Mankind's curse.
453;00:32:14,700;00:32:17,779;Archmaester, I was wondering...
454;00:32:17,780;00:32:19,739;What's the weight?
455;00:32:19,740;00:32:22,700;Um, 147.
456;00:32:25,610;00:32:28,699;I was wondering if you had
456;00:32:25,610;00:32:28,699;considered my proposition.
457;00:32:28,700;00:32:31,779;I don't remember
457;00:32:28,700;00:32:31,779;your proposition.
458;00:32:31,780;00:32:35,069;I asked you if,
458;00:32:31,780;00:32:35,069;in light of what
458;00:32:31,780;00:32:35,069;I've seen in the North,
459;00:32:35,070;00:32:38,239;if I could have access
459;00:32:35,070;00:32:38,239;to the restricted area
459;00:32:35,070;00:32:38,239;of the library.
460;00:32:38,240;00:32:39,949;That area is reserved
460;00:32:38,240;00:32:39,949;for maesters.
461;00:32:39,950;00:32:42,449;Are you a maester?
461;00:32:39,950;00:32:42,449;No.
462;00:32:42,450;00:32:44,570;Not a very strong
462;00:32:42,450;00:32:44,570;proposition, is it?
463;00:32:53,860;00:32:56,529;Archmaester, with respect,
464;00:32:56,530;00:32:58,359;I've seen them--
465;00:32:58,360;00:33:00,609;the Army of the Dead.
466;00:33:00,610;00:33:02,989;The white walkers.
467;00:33:02,990;00:33:05,489;I was sent here to learn
467;00:33:02,990;00:33:05,489;how to defeat them,
468;00:33:05,490;00:33:08,029;but everyone in the Citadel,
469;00:33:08,030;00:33:10,199;those who will even talk to me,
470;00:33:10,200;00:33:13,029;they all doubt
470;00:33:10,200;00:33:13,029;the walkers ever existed
470;00:33:10,200;00:33:13,029;in the first place.
471;00:33:13,030;00:33:15,569;Everyone in the Citadel
471;00:33:13,030;00:33:15,569;doubts everything.
472;00:33:15,570;00:33:16,660;It's their job.
473;00:33:22,200;00:33:25,490;But the tales
473;00:33:22,200;00:33:25,490;of the Long Night
473;00:33:22,200;00:33:25,490;can't be pure fabrication.
474;00:33:27,320;00:33:30,239;Too many similarities
474;00:33:27,320;00:33:30,239;from unconnected sources.
475;00:33:30,240;00:33:32,819;Sources in the restricted area?
476;00:33:32,820;00:33:34,450;The very same.
477;00:33:35,740;00:33:37,199;And the simplest explanation
478;00:33:37,200;00:33:40,159;for your grating obsession
478;00:33:37,200;00:33:40,159;with the white walkers
479;00:33:40,160;00:33:41,659;is that you're telling the truth
480;00:33:41,660;00:33:44,779;and that you saw
480;00:33:41,660;00:33:44,779;what you say you saw.
481;00:33:44,780;00:33:47,660;So, you believe me.
482;00:33:48,820;00:33:50,489;I do.
483;00:33:50,490;00:33:52,200;You'll finish
483;00:33:50,490;00:33:52,200;weighing that heart?
484;00:33:54,490;00:33:57,320;That makes you
484;00:33:54,490;00:33:57,320;the only person
484;00:33:54,490;00:33:57,320;south of the Twins who does.
485;00:34:00,360;00:34:03,199;We're not like the people
485;00:34:00,360;00:34:03,199;south of the Twins.
486;00:34:03,200;00:34:05,410;And we're not
486;00:34:03,200;00:34:05,410;like the people
486;00:34:03,200;00:34:05,410;north of the Twins.
487;00:34:07,740;00:34:11,660;In the Citadel,
487;00:34:07,740;00:34:11,660;we lead different lives
487;00:34:07,740;00:34:11,660;for different reasons.
488;00:34:13,530;00:34:16,319;We are this world's memory,

489;00:34:16,320;00:34:19,279;Without us, men would be
489;00:34:16,320;00:34:19,279;little better than dogs.
490;00:34:19,280;00:34:21,449;Don't remember
490;00:34:19,280;00:34:21,449;any meal but the last,

656;00:45:59,910;00:46:01,489;So, why you?
