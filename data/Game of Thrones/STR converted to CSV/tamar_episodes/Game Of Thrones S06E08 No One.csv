11;00:02:30,458;00:02:32,658;my love.

21;00:03:03,958;00:03:06,559;a fortnight,
22;00:03:06,661;00:03:10,196;a moon or my life.
23;00:03:34,756;00:03:37,156;What is that
23;00:03:34,756;00:03:37,156;I hear and smell?
24;00:03:37,258;00:03:40,559;Someone I'll soon send to hell.
25;00:03:40,661;00:03:43,295;It's time to see
25;00:03:40,661;00:03:43,295;if truth they told
26;00:03:43,398;00:03:46,232;who said Tywin Lannister
26;00:03:43,398;00:03:46,232;shits gold.
27;00:03:46,334;00:03:48,067;Get the wig!
28;00:03:48,169;00:03:51,837;You beast, you beast.
28;00:03:48,169;00:03:51,837;You killed my wife.
29;00:03:51,939;00:03:53,512;And now you've taken
29;00:03:51,939;00:03:53,512;your father's life.
30;00:03:55,209;00:03:58,344;No worse child
30;00:03:55,209;00:03:58,344;ever stained this land.
31;00:03:58,446;00:04:01,680;I curse the day I named you.
32;00:04:04,052;00:04:06,952;My greatest crime!
33;00:04:38,686;00:04:40,386;You're good at that.
34;00:04:40,488;00:04:42,955;Where did you learn?
35;00:04:43,057;00:04:44,690;I'm a jealous woman.
36;00:04:44,792;00:04:47,093;I've always
36;00:04:44,792;00:04:47,093;liked bad men
37;00:04:47,195;00:04:49,295;and they've always
37;00:04:47,195;00:04:49,295;liked me.
38;00:04:51,132;00:04:53,866;They'd come home
38;00:04:51,132;00:04:53,866;wherever home was that night
39;00:04:53,968;00:04:58,170;stinking of some
39;00:04:53,968;00:04:58,170;whore's perfume.
40;00:04:58,272;00:05:01,107;So we'd fight
40;00:04:58,272;00:05:01,107;and I'd put a hole in them.
41;00:05:01,209;00:05:03,943;And then
41;00:05:01,209;00:05:03,943;I'd feel terrible,
42;00:05:04,045;00:05:06,011;so I'd patch them up.
43;00:05:06,114;00:05:07,513;I got good
43;00:05:06,114;00:05:07,513;at patching them up.
44;00:05:07,615;00:05:09,248;And good at putting
44;00:05:07,615;00:05:09,248;holes in them.
45;00:05:09,350;00:05:11,584;And that.
46;00:05:14,422;00:05:16,655;What happened
46;00:05:14,422;00:05:16,655;to the actress?
47;00:05:16,757;00:05:19,859;The one who wanted
47;00:05:16,757;00:05:19,859;you dead.
48;00:05:19,961;00:05:21,594;Bianca.
49;00:05:21,696;00:05:24,230;She'll have a hard time
49;00:05:21,696;00:05:24,230;finding work as an actress
50;00:05:24,332;00:05:26,365;after what I did
50;00:05:24,332;00:05:26,365;to her face.
51;00:05:31,606;00:05:32,805;Mmm.
52;00:05:32,907;00:05:34,974;I never did
52;00:05:32,907;00:05:34,974;learn to cook.
53;00:05:35,076;00:05:37,643;But eat.
53;00:05:35,076;00:05:37,643;Eat. You need it.
54;00:05:39,747;00:05:42,615;The company is moving on
54;00:05:39,747;00:05:42,615;to Pentos soon.
55;00:05:42,717;00:05:44,250;You should come with us.
56;00:05:44,352;00:05:46,385;I can't.
56;00:05:44,352;00:05:46,385;Why not?
57;00:05:46,487;00:05:48,921;Got a feeling you'd be good at
57;00:05:46,487;00:05:48,921;this sort of work.
58;00:05:49,023;00:05:51,090;And besides,
58;00:05:49,023;00:05:51,090;we need a new actress.
59;00:05:51,192;00:05:54,927;I don't think I could remember
59;00:05:51,192;00:05:54,927;all of the lines.
60;00:05:55,029;00:05:57,429;Come with us.
61;00:05:57,532;00:05:59,498;What's left
61;00:05:57,532;00:05:59,498;for you here?
62;00:06:00,668;00:06:03,435;You wouldn't be safe.
63;00:06:03,538;00:06:06,338;Not while
63;00:06:03,538;00:06:06,338;she's looking for me.
64;00:06:06,440;00:06:08,574;Who?
65;00:06:08,676;00:06:10,242;She doesn't have a name.
66;00:06:15,917;00:06:17,483;Where will you go?
67;00:06:20,321;00:06:23,856;Essos is east
67;00:06:20,321;00:06:23,856;and Westeros is west.
68;00:06:23,958;00:06:25,925;But what's west
68;00:06:23,958;00:06:25,925;of Westeros?
69;00:06:27,328;00:06:28,394;I don't know.
70;00:06:28,496;00:06:30,062;Nobody does.
71;00:06:30,164;00:06:32,264;That's where
71;00:06:30,164;00:06:32,264;all the maps stop.
72;00:06:32,366;00:06:34,300;The edge
72;00:06:32,366;00:06:34,300;of the world, maybe.
73;00:06:34,402;00:06:35,701;I'd like to see that.
74;00:06:46,614;00:06:48,781;What's that?
74;00:06:46,614;00:06:48,781;Milk of the poppy.
75;00:06:48,883;00:06:50,449;I don't want any.
76;00:06:52,620;00:06:55,754;Sleep is the only way
76;00:06:52,620;00:06:55,754;you'll heal.
77;00:06:55,856;00:06:59,692;Trust me, if my soup
77;00:06:55,856;00:06:59,692;didn't kill you, nothing will.
78;00:07:42,036;00:07:45,404;Thing about Gatins, right,
78;00:07:42,036;00:07:45,404;is he used to be pretty.
79;00:07:45,506;00:07:46,839;I was a famous kisser.
80;00:07:46,941;00:07:49,508;You lads know
80;00:07:46,941;00:07:49,508;how to kiss proper?
81;00:07:51,545;00:07:52,678;Course we do.
82;00:07:52,780;00:07:55,314;This is for masters,
82;00:07:52,780;00:07:55,314;this technique.
83;00:07:55,416;00:07:57,249;You're not ready.
83;00:07:55,416;00:07:57,249;I'm ready.
84;00:07:57,351;00:07:59,752;He says he's ready.
85;00:07:59,854;00:08:02,855;All right.
85;00:07:59,854;00:08:02,855;Now, pay attention.
86;00:08:05,326;00:08:08,961;You put your left hand on the back
86;00:08:05,326;00:08:08,961;of the lady's head.
87;00:08:09,063;00:08:12,364;Your right hand holds the small
87;00:08:09,063;00:08:12,364;of the lady's back like so.
88;00:08:13,534;00:08:14,867;Very romantic.
89;00:08:14,969;00:08:17,970;Take your middle
89;00:08:14,969;00:08:17,970;finger, yeah,
90;00:08:18,072;00:08:20,172;and you jam it
90;00:08:18,072;00:08:20,172;right up her bunghole.
91;00:08:23,177;00:08:24,576;So fucking close!
92;00:08:24,679;00:08:27,313;Ah, it smells
92;00:08:24,679;00:08:27,313;like pussy to me.
93;00:08:27,415;00:08:29,014;Look at him.
93;00:08:27,415;00:08:29,014;You get hard, boy?
94;00:08:29,116;00:08:32,184;Fuck you!
94;00:08:29,116;00:08:32,184;Disgusting old twats.
95;00:08:35,923;00:08:38,657;Got off on that,
95;00:08:35,923;00:08:38,657;did you, you old fuck?
96;00:09:00,581;00:09:02,114;Where's the other one?
97;00:09:02,216;00:09:04,750;The one with the yellow cloak.
97;00:09:02,216;00:09:04,750;Fuck you!
98;00:09:04,852;00:09:07,152;Those are your last words,
98;00:09:04,852;00:09:07,152;fuck you?
99;00:09:07,254;00:09:09,121;Come on,
99;00:09:07,254;00:09:09,121;you can do better.
100;00:09:09,223;00:09:10,589;Cunt!
101;00:09:10,691;00:09:13,158;You're shit at dying,
101;00:09:10,691;00:09:13,158;you know that?
102;00:09:32,157;00:09:36,798;_
103;00:09:36,822;00:09:42,003;_
104;00:09:42,027;00:09:45,475;_
105;00:09:47,228;00:09:49,395;I'd call that
105;00:09:47,228;00:09:49,395;a successful gambit.
106;00:09:49,497;00:09:51,296;Would you?
106;00:09:49,497;00:09:51,296;Look around.
107;00:09:51,399;00:09:53,499;The city has
107;00:09:51,399;00:09:53,499;come back to life.
108;00:09:53,601;00:09:55,257;You made
108;00:09:53,601;00:09:55,257;a pact with fanatics.
109;00:09:55,281;00:09:57,281;I did and it worked.
110;00:09:57,371;00:10:00,014;If you shaved your beard
110;00:09:57,371;00:10:00,014;with a straight razor,
111;00:10:00,038;00:10:01,241;you'd say the razor worked.
112;00:10:01,242;00:10:03,409;That doesn't mean
112;00:10:01,242;00:10:03,409;it won't cut your throat.
113;00:10:03,511;00:10:06,745;Spoken like a man who has
113;00:10:03,511;00:10:06,745;never had to shave.
114;00:10:11,485;00:10:13,218;I'm going
114;00:10:11,485;00:10:13,218;to miss you.
115;00:10:13,320;00:10:14,920;I know.
116;00:10:15,022;00:10:18,023;I hope you're right
116;00:10:15,022;00:10:18,023;about this expedition of yours.
117;00:10:18,125;00:10:21,393;If I don't return,
117;00:10:18,125;00:10:21,393;you'll know I was wrong.
118;00:10:25,166;00:10:26,899;We need friends
118;00:10:25,166;00:10:26,899;in Westeros.
119;00:10:27,001;00:10:28,567;And we need ships.
120;00:10:28,669;00:10:30,202;Most of all,
120;00:10:28,669;00:10:30,202;we need our queen.
121;00:10:30,304;00:10:33,772;She'll come back.
121;00:10:30,304;00:10:33,772;She has to.
122;00:10:33,874;00:10:36,575;My heart's been broken
122;00:10:33,874;00:10:36,575;too many times already.
123;00:10:38,646;00:10:41,113;I'll walk the rest
123;00:10:38,646;00:10:41,113;of the way myself.
124;00:10:41,215;00:10:42,815;I can't go off
124;00:10:41,215;00:10:42,815;on a secret mission
125;00:10:42,917;00:10:45,517;in the company of the most
125;00:10:42,917;00:10:45,517;famous dwarf in the city.
126;00:10:49,123;00:10:51,390;Varys.
127;00:10:51,492;00:10:54,493;The most famous dwarf
127;00:10:51,492;00:10:54,493;in the world.
128;00:11:22,656;00:11:25,090;Your Grace, several members
128;00:11:22,656;00:11:25,090;of the Faith Militant
129;00:11:25,192;00:11:27,860;have been permitted
129;00:11:25,192;00:11:27,860;entry to the Red Keep.
130;00:11:27,962;00:11:30,195;Have been permitted?
131;00:11:30,297;00:11:32,431;That's rather a tortured
131;00:11:30,297;00:11:32,431;way of putting it.
132;00:11:32,533;00:11:35,067;They demand to see you,
132;00:11:32,533;00:11:35,067;Your Grace.
133;00:11:35,169;00:11:37,202;Who permitted them
133;00:11:35,169;00:11:37,202;inside the Red Keep?
134;00:11:40,708;00:11:42,741;The king is aware
134;00:11:40,708;00:11:42,741;of their presence?
135;00:11:42,843;00:11:44,276;He is, Your Grace.
136;00:11:44,378;00:11:47,079;He's currently
136;00:11:44,378;00:11:47,079;in his chambers at prayer.
137;00:12:02,596;00:12:04,796;Your Grace, His Holiness
137;00:12:02,596;00:12:04,796;the High Septon
138;00:12:04,899;00:12:07,599;wishes to speak with you
138;00:12:04,899;00:12:07,599;at the Great Sept of Baelor.
139;00:12:07,701;00:12:09,334;His Holiness
139;00:12:07,701;00:12:09,334;the High Septon
140;00:12:09,436;00:12:12,304;is welcome to see me
140;00:12:09,436;00:12:12,304;here in the Red Keep.
141;00:12:12,406;00:12:14,873;Your Grace,
141;00:12:12,406;00:12:14,873;this is not a request.
142;00:12:14,975;00:12:17,175;It is a request,
142;00:12:14,975;00:12:17,175;Cousin Lancel.
143;00:12:17,278;00:12:19,878;You are asking me
143;00:12:17,278;00:12:19,878;for something, I'm refusing.
144;00:12:21,682;00:12:24,816;The High Septon
144;00:12:21,682;00:12:24,816;commands you.
145;00:12:24,919;00:12:27,019;Are you sure you want
145;00:12:24,919;00:12:27,019;to refuse him?
146;00:12:29,356;00:12:32,424;He promised me I could
146;00:12:29,356;00:12:32,424;stay in the Red Keep until my trial.
147;00:12:32,526;00:12:34,459;He made
147;00:12:32,526;00:12:34,459;no such promises.
148;00:12:34,562;00:12:35,991;If you refuse to come
148;00:12:34,562;00:12:35,991;of your own free will--
149;00:12:36,015;00:12:38,015;Get out.
150;00:12:47,641;00:12:49,241;Move aside, ser.
151;00:12:52,513;00:12:55,447;Order your man to step aside
151;00:12:52,513;00:12:55,447;or there will be violence.
152;00:13:03,057;00:13:04,723;I choose violence.
153;00:13:45,933;00:13:49,468;Please tell His High Holiness
153;00:13:45,933;00:13:49,468;he's always welcome to visit.
154;00:14:01,048;00:14:03,315;Looks like a siege,
154;00:14:01,048;00:14:03,315;my lady.
155;00:14:03,417;00:14:06,785;You have a keen
155;00:14:03,417;00:14:06,785;military mind, Pod.
156;00:14:15,963;00:14:18,630;My lady.
156;00:14:15,963;00:14:18,630;My lady.
157;00:14:22,002;00:14:24,336;Who goes there?!
158;00:14:24,438;00:14:25,671;State your business!
159;00:14:25,773;00:14:27,806;My name
159;00:14:25,773;00:14:27,806;is Brienne of Tarth.
160;00:14:27,908;00:14:31,743;Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister
160;00:14:27,908;00:14:31,743;I've come to speak with him.
161;00:14:33,681;00:14:36,648;Tell him
161;00:14:33,681;00:14:36,648;I have his sword.
162;00:14:47,828;00:14:50,095;Getting a bit old
162;00:14:47,828;00:14:50,095;to be a squire, aren't we?
163;00:14:55,536;00:14:56,802;Podrick fucking Payne.
164;00:14:56,904;00:14:59,504;I thought
164;00:14:56,904;00:14:59,504;you'd be dead by now.
165;00:14:59,606;00:15:01,006;Not yet.
166;00:15:02,710;00:15:04,776;Are they in there?
166;00:15:02,710;00:15:04,776;Uh-huh.
167;00:15:08,649;00:15:10,749;You think
167;00:15:08,649;00:15:10,749;they're fucking?
168;00:15:10,851;00:15:12,384;What?
169;00:15:12,486;00:15:14,086;No.
170;00:15:14,188;00:15:17,055;Why not?
170;00:15:14,188;00:15:17,055;I'd fuck her.
171;00:15:17,157;00:15:18,790;You'd fuck her,
171;00:15:17,157;00:15:18,790;wouldn't you?
172;00:15:18,892;00:15:21,193;I'm her squire.
172;00:15:18,892;00:15:21,193;Oh.
173;00:15:21,295;00:15:24,496;Well, he'd fuck her,
173;00:15:21,295;00:15:24,496;that's for sure.
174;00:15:24,598;00:15:26,565;And she'd fuck him,
174;00:15:24,598;00:15:26,565;don't you think?
175;00:15:26,667;00:15:28,500;The way
175;00:15:26,667;00:15:28,500;she looks at him.
176;00:15:28,602;00:15:31,103;The way all women
176;00:15:28,602;00:15:31,103;look at him is frankly irritating.
177;00:15:31,205;00:15:34,306;I preferred working with
177;00:15:31,205;00:15:34,306;the little brother on that account.
178;00:15:34,408;00:15:38,143;Come on, you're the one
178;00:15:34,408;00:15:38,143;with the magic cock.
179;00:15:39,546;00:15:41,646;You must have
179;00:15:39,546;00:15:41,646;shown it to her by now.
180;00:15:43,684;00:15:46,384;She's training me to fight.
180;00:15:43,684;00:15:46,384;Is she?
181;00:15:46,386;00:15:46,978;Oh.
182;00:15:47,002;00:15:48,650;An hour in the morning,
182;00:15:47,002;00:15:48,650;an hour at night.
183;00:15:49,022;00:15:50,822;Every day.
184;00:15:50,924;00:15:54,726;Then how come an old cunt like me
184;00:15:50,924;00:15:54,726;can still sneak up and murder you?
185;00:15:54,828;00:15:57,362;Well, that's a different
185;00:15:54,828;00:15:57,362;sort of fighting.
186;00:15:57,464;00:15:59,064;Now, that's the truth,
186;00:15:57,464;00:15:59,064;isn't it?
187;00:15:59,166;00:16:01,733;You want to learn
187;00:15:59,166;00:16:01,733;that sort of fighting?
188;00:16:03,103;00:16:04,936;All right.
189;00:16:05,038;00:16:07,305;All right, let's start
189;00:16:05,038;00:16:07,305;with your footwork.
190;00:16:07,407;00:16:09,608;Show me your stance.
191;00:16:11,044;00:16:12,611;Now listen to me, Pod.
192;00:16:12,713;00:16:15,380;See how your feet
192;00:16:12,713;00:16:15,380;are about a yard apart?
193;00:16:15,482;00:16:18,283;Lesson number one,
193;00:16:15,482;00:16:18,283;assume everyone wants to hit you.
194;00:16:18,385;00:16:22,487;'Cause they do, Pod.
194;00:16:18,385;00:16:22,487;Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire.
195;00:16:22,589;00:16:25,190;Do it again.
195;00:16:22,589;00:16:25,190;Come on, don't sulk.
196;00:16:25,292;00:16:26,892;I never thought
196;00:16:25,292;00:16:26,892;you'd find her.
197;00:16:26,994;00:16:28,426;I just assumed
197;00:16:26,994;00:16:28,426;Sansa was dead.
198;00:16:28,529;00:16:30,629;Why would you
198;00:16:28,529;00:16:30,629;assume that?
199;00:16:30,731;00:16:34,666;In my experience,
199;00:16:30,731;00:16:34,666;girls like her don't live very long.
200;00:16:34,768;00:16:37,402;I don't think you know
200;00:16:34,768;00:16:37,402;many girls like her.
201;00:16:37,504;00:16:40,438;Well, I'm proud of you.
202;00:16:40,541;00:16:41,304;I am.
203;00:16:41,328;00:16:43,242;You fulfilled your oath
203;00:16:41,328;00:16:43,242;to Catelyn Stark
204;00:16:43,243;00:16:45,010;against all odds.
205;00:16:45,112;00:16:48,079;Of course, my sister
205;00:16:45,112;00:16:48,079;wants Sansa dead.
206;00:16:48,182;00:16:50,782;The girl is still a suspect
206;00:16:48,182;00:16:50,782;in Joffrey's murder,
207;00:16:50,884;00:16:54,619;so there is
207;00:16:50,884;00:16:54,619;that complication.
208;00:16:56,390;00:16:57,670;What the hell
208;00:16:56,390;00:16:57,670;are you doing here?
209;00:16:57,758;00:16:59,491;I've come
209;00:16:57,758;00:16:59,491;for the Blackfish.
210;00:16:59,593;00:17:01,393;You're welcome
210;00:16:59,593;00:17:01,393;to have him.
211;00:17:01,495;00:17:05,263;Lady Sansa desires to take her
211;00:17:01,495;00:17:05,263;ancestral seat back from the Boltons
212;00:17:05,365;00:17:08,533;and assume her rightful position
212;00:17:05,365;00:17:08,533;as Lady of Winterfell.
213;00:17:08,635;00:17:11,703;With what army does she plan on
213;00:17:08,635;00:17:11,703;taking Winterfell?
214;00:17:11,805;00:17:13,171;The Tully army.
215;00:17:13,273;00:17:15,006;They're a bit occupied
215;00:17:13,273;00:17:15,006;at the moment.
216;00:17:15,108;00:17:16,775;I was sent here
216;00:17:15,108;00:17:16,775;to reclaim Riverrun
217;00:17:16,877;00:17:18,610;currently defended
217;00:17:16,877;00:17:18,610;by the Tully rebels,
218;00:17:18,712;00:17:20,412;so you can see
218;00:17:18,712;00:17:20,412;the conundrum.
219;00:17:20,514;00:17:22,614;The Tullys are rebels because
219;00:17:20,514;00:17:22,614;they're fighting for their home?
220;00:17:22,716;00:17:25,150;Riverrun was granted to
220;00:17:22,716;00:17:25,150;the Freys by royal decree.
221;00:17:25,252;00:17:28,753;As a reward for betraying Robb Stark
221;00:17:25,252;00:17:28,753;and slaughtering his family.
222;00:17:28,856;00:17:30,255;Exactly.
223;00:17:34,228;00:17:35,894;We shouldn't argue
223;00:17:34,228;00:17:35,894;about politics.
224;00:17:35,996;00:17:38,730;You're a knight,
224;00:17:35,996;00:17:38,730;Ser Jaime.
225;00:17:38,832;00:17:40,799;I know there is
225;00:17:38,832;00:17:40,799;honor in you.
226;00:17:40,901;00:17:43,668;I've seen it myself.
226;00:17:40,901;00:17:43,668;I'm a Lannister.
227;00:17:43,770;00:17:45,670;Don't ask me
227;00:17:43,770;00:17:45,670;to betray my own house.
228;00:17:45,772;00:17:48,039;I do no such thing.
229;00:17:48,141;00:17:50,709;Take Riverrun
229;00:17:48,141;00:17:50,709;without bloodshed.
230;00:17:50,811;00:17:54,346;Ride south again with your mission complete
230;00:17:50,811;00:17:54,346;and your army intact.
231;00:17:54,448;00:17:56,047;What do you propose?
232;00:17:56,149;00:17:59,818;Allow me to enter Riverrun
232;00:17:56,149;00:17:59,818;under a flag of truce.
233;00:17:59,920;00:18:02,254;Let me try to persuade
233;00:17:59,920;00:18:02,254;the Blackfish to give up the castle.
234;00:18:02,356;00:18:04,356;Why would he abandon
234;00:18:02,356;00:18:04,356;his ancestral home?
235;00:18:04,458;00:18:08,059;Because you'll allow him
235;00:18:04,458;00:18:08,059;to lead the Tully forces safely north.
236;00:18:11,064;00:18:12,931;Have you ever met
236;00:18:11,064;00:18:12,931;the Blackfish?
237;00:18:15,002;00:18:15,698;No.
238;00:18:15,722;00:18:17,290;He's even more stubborn
238;00:18:15,722;00:18:17,290;than you are.
239;00:18:17,938;00:18:20,005;All right.
240;00:18:20,107;00:18:22,507;Try to talk some sense
240;00:18:20,107;00:18:22,507;into the old goat.
241;00:18:22,609;00:18:24,910;He won't listen,
241;00:18:22,609;00:18:24,910;but his men might.
242;00:18:25,012;00:18:27,479;Not everybody wants to die
242;00:18:25,012;00:18:27,479;for someone else's home.
243;00:18:27,581;00:18:29,614;I need your word.
244;00:18:30,984;00:18:32,851;If I persuade him
244;00:18:30,984;00:18:32,851;to abandon the castle,
245;00:18:32,953;00:18:35,387;you'll grant
245;00:18:32,953;00:18:35,387;a safe passage north.
246;00:18:35,489;00:18:37,689;You have my word.
247;00:18:37,791;00:18:39,724;You have until nightfall.
248;00:18:56,643;00:18:59,311;You gave it to me
248;00:18:56,643;00:18:59,311;for a purpose.
249;00:18:59,413;00:19:02,614;I've achieved
249;00:18:59,413;00:19:02,614;that purpose.
250;00:19:05,419;00:19:07,085;It's yours.
251;00:19:08,822;00:19:10,822;It will always
251;00:19:08,822;00:19:10,822;be yours.
252;00:19:20,133;00:19:22,133;One last thing,
252;00:19:20,133;00:19:22,133;Ser Jaime.
253;00:19:22,235;00:19:24,369;Yes, Lady Brienne?
254;00:19:24,471;00:19:28,406;Should I fail to persuade
254;00:19:24,471;00:19:28,406;the Blackfish to surrender
255;00:19:28,508;00:19:31,376;and if you attack
255;00:19:28,508;00:19:31,376;the castle,
256;00:19:31,478;00:19:34,512;honor compels me
256;00:19:31,478;00:19:34,512;to fight for Sansa's kin.
257;00:19:34,614;00:19:36,681;Of course it does.
258;00:19:36,783;00:19:38,283;To fight you.
259;00:19:42,789;00:19:44,956;Let's hope it doesn't
259;00:19:42,789;00:19:44,956;come to that.
260;00:19:55,202;00:19:57,235;I've said no
260;00:19:55,202;00:19:57,235;three times already.
261;00:19:57,337;00:19:59,571;I have a signed letter
261;00:19:57,337;00:19:59,571;from your niece Sansa Stark.
262;00:19:59,673;00:20:01,473;I haven't seen her
262;00:19:59,673;00:20:01,473;since she was a child.
263;00:20:01,575;00:20:03,742;I don't know her signature.
263;00:20:01,575;00:20:03,742;I don't know you.
264;00:20:03,844;00:20:07,312;And I will not surrender.
264;00:20:03,844;00:20:07,312;Double the guards tonight.
265;00:20:08,715;00:20:10,949;The Kingslayer
265;00:20:08,715;00:20:10,949;wants to try us.
266;00:20:11,051;00:20:12,984;I can feel it.
267;00:20:14,087;00:20:15,653;As I have said,
267;00:20:14,087;00:20:15,653;my name is--
268;00:20:15,756;00:20:18,189;Yes, Brienne of Tarth.
268;00:20:15,756;00:20:18,189;I know your father.
269;00:20:18,291;00:20:20,091;Good man.
269;00:20:18,291;00:20:20,091;He always spoke highly of you.
270;00:20:20,193;00:20:22,894;And if he were here now,
270;00:20:20,193;00:20:22,894;I'd tell him the same I'm telling you.
271;00:20:22,996;00:20:25,430;If you think I'm abandoning
271;00:20:22,996;00:20:25,430;my family's seat
272;00:20:25,532;00:20:27,832;on the Kingslayer's
272;00:20:25,532;00:20:27,832;word of honor, you're a bloody fool.
273;00:20:27,934;00:20:30,602;Riverrun cannot stand
273;00:20:27,934;00:20:30,602;against the Lannisters and the Freys.
274;00:20:30,704;00:20:34,305;We can stand longer than your
274;00:20:30,704;00:20:34,305;one-handed friend thinks we can.
275;00:20:34,408;00:20:36,841;He's not my friend.
275;00:20:34,408;00:20:36,841;No?
276;00:20:38,612;00:20:41,579;Who gave you permission to cross
276;00:20:38,612;00:20:41,579;the siege line and enter the castle?
277;00:20:41,681;00:20:44,449;Who gave you that sword
277;00:20:41,681;00:20:44,449;with the gold lion on the pommel?
278;00:20:44,551;00:20:48,353;Ser Jaime kept his word
278;00:20:44,551;00:20:48,353;to your niece Catelyn Stark.
279;00:20:48,455;00:20:51,689;He sent me to find Sansa,
279;00:20:48,455;00:20:51,689;to help her as Catelyn wanted.
280;00:20:51,792;00:20:53,892;He gave me this sword
280;00:20:51,792;00:20:53,892;to protect her.
281;00:20:53,994;00:20:56,661;That is what I have done
281;00:20:53,994;00:20:56,661;and I will continue to do
282;00:20:56,763;00:20:59,064;until the day I die.
283;00:21:12,212;00:21:14,546;She's exactly
283;00:21:12,212;00:21:14,546;like her mother.
284;00:21:20,854;00:21:23,888;I don't have enough men to help
284;00:21:20,854;00:21:23,888;her take Winterfell.
285;00:21:23,990;00:21:26,057;You have more
285;00:21:23,990;00:21:26,057;than she does.
286;00:21:26,159;00:21:28,693;She wants her home back.
286;00:21:26,159;00:21:28,693;I understand that.
287;00:21:28,795;00:21:30,662;But this is my home.
288;00:21:30,764;00:21:32,730;And if Jaime Lannister
288;00:21:30,764;00:21:32,730;wants it,
289;00:21:32,833;00:21:36,434;he can bloody well take it
289;00:21:32,833;00:21:36,434;the way everyone else does.
290;00:21:53,186;00:21:55,887;Find the maester.
291;00:21:55,989;00:21:58,690;We need to get a raven
291;00:21:55,989;00:21:58,690;north to Sansa.
292;00:22:00,460;00:22:02,193;What should I write?
293;00:22:04,998;00:22:06,865;Tell her I failed.
294;00:22:37,697;00:22:39,297;There's to be
294;00:22:37,697;00:22:39,297;a royal announcement?
295;00:22:39,399;00:22:41,366;There is.
296;00:22:41,468;00:22:43,067;Why wasn't I informed?
297;00:22:45,038;00:22:48,139;There is to be
297;00:22:45,038;00:22:48,139;a royal announcement
298;00:22:48,241;00:22:50,208;in the throne room
299;00:22:50,310;00:22:52,310;at this very moment.
300;00:22:55,315;00:22:57,348;Where are you going?
301;00:23:00,253;00:23:02,320;To stand by my son.
302;00:23:02,422;00:23:05,089;Your place
302;00:23:02,422;00:23:05,089;is in the gallery
303;00:23:05,192;00:23:07,859;with the other ladies
303;00:23:05,192;00:23:07,859;of the court.
304;00:23:15,569;00:23:17,202;Your Grace...

307;00:23:40,393;00:23:43,628;are the two pillars
307;00:23:40,393;00:23:43,628;that hold up this world.
308;00:23:43,730;00:23:47,365;One collapses,
308;00:23:43,730;00:23:47,365;so does the other.
309;00:23:48,935;00:23:51,436;The Father judges us all.
310;00:23:51,538;00:23:52,971;If you break his laws...
311;00:23:55,842;00:23:58,109;you will be punished.
312;00:23:59,879;00:24:03,681;After conferring with His Holiness
312;00:23:59,879;00:24:03,681;the High Septon,
313;00:24:03,783;00:24:06,117;we have determined
313;00:24:03,783;00:24:06,117;that Loras Tyrell

316;00:24:10,190;00:24:12,690;on the first day
316;00:24:10,190;00:24:12,690;of the Festival of the Mother.
317;00:24:19,065;00:24:22,066;Furthermore,
317;00:24:19,065;00:24:22,066;after much prayer
318;00:24:22,168;00:24:24,235;and reflection,
319;00:24:24,337;00:24:27,438;the Crown has decided
319;00:24:24,337;00:24:27,438;that from this day forward,
320;00:24:27,540;00:24:29,507;trial by combat
320;00:24:27,540;00:24:29,507;will be forbidden
321;00:24:29,609;00:24:31,643;throughout
321;00:24:29,609;00:24:31,643;the Seven Kingdoms.
322;00:24:33,480;00:24:35,680;The tradition
322;00:24:33,480;00:24:35,680;is a brutish one,
323;00:24:35,782;00:24:37,749;a scheme devised
323;00:24:35,782;00:24:37,749;by corrupt rulers
324;00:24:37,851;00:24:40,485;in order to avoid
324;00:24:37,851;00:24:40,485;true judgment from the gods.
325;00:24:40,587;00:24:43,087;Cersei Lannister
325;00:24:40,587;00:24:43,087;and Loras Tyrell
326;00:24:43,189;00:24:45,156;will stand trial
326;00:24:43,189;00:24:45,156;before seven septons
327;00:24:45,258;00:24:48,059;as it was in the earliest
327;00:24:45,258;00:24:48,059;days of the Faith.
328;00:24:48,161;00:24:50,295;Seven blessings to all.

331;00:25:17,223;00:25:20,692;that old rumor
331;00:25:17,223;00:25:20,692;you told me about.
332;00:25:22,329;00:25:24,696;My little birds
332;00:25:22,329;00:25:24,696;investigated.
333;00:25:26,566;00:25:29,300;And?
334;00:25:29,402;00:25:32,503;Was it just a rumor
334;00:25:29,402;00:25:32,503;or something more?
335;00:25:32,605;00:25:34,238;More.
336;00:25:36,476;00:25:38,076;Much more.
337;00:25:44,050;00:25:46,250;You seem happy.
338;00:25:46,353;00:25:48,186;I am happy.
339;00:25:49,422;00:25:51,255;You should both
339;00:25:49,422;00:25:51,255;be happy as well.
340;00:25:51,358;00:25:55,727;Not so long ago,
340;00:25:51,358;00:25:55,727;this city was ready to devour itself.
341;00:25:55,829;00:25:58,262;Now it's like
341;00:25:55,829;00:25:58,262;a man reborn.
342;00:25:58,365;00:26:00,465;I will be happy
342;00:25:58,365;00:26:00,465;when our queen returns.
343;00:26:00,567;00:26:04,235;Why don't you drink?
343;00:26:00,567;00:26:04,235;Why don't either of you ever drink?
344;00:26:04,337;00:26:05,670;Unsullied never drink.
345;00:26:05,772;00:26:07,038;Why not?
345;00:26:05,772;00:26:07,038;Rules.
346;00:26:07,140;00:26:09,440;And who made these rules?
347;00:26:09,542;00:26:11,442;Your former masters?
348;00:26:11,544;00:26:14,612;Those miserable old shits
348;00:26:11,544;00:26:14,612;didn't want you to be human.
349;00:26:14,714;00:26:16,781;Have a drink with me.
350;00:26:19,753;00:26:23,020;And you?
350;00:26:19,753;00:26:23,020;What's your excuse?
351;00:26:24,057;00:26:25,556;I have tried
351;00:26:24,057;00:26:25,556;wine before.
352;00:26:25,658;00:26:27,458;It made me feel funny.
353;00:26:27,560;00:26:29,527;That's how you know
353;00:26:27,560;00:26:29,527;it's working.
354;00:26:31,998;00:26:34,499;Here's to our queen.
355;00:26:34,601;00:26:37,869;Anyone not drinking
355;00:26:34,601;00:26:37,869;is disrespecting our queen.
356;00:26:41,107;00:26:43,307;To Daenerys Stormborn,

358;00:26:46,212;00:26:48,413;Long may she reign.
359;00:26:54,154;00:26:55,686;Do you like it?
360;00:26:55,789;00:26:57,822;Tastes like
360;00:26:55,789;00:26:57,822;it has turned.
361;00:26:57,924;00:27:01,159;Yes, yes.
361;00:26:57,924;00:27:01,159;Fermentation.
362;00:27:04,731;00:27:09,333;One day, after our queen has taken
362;00:27:04,731;00:27:09,333;the Seven Kingdoms...
363;00:27:11,070;00:27:13,304;I'd like to have
363;00:27:11,070;00:27:13,304;my own vineyard.
364;00:27:14,607;00:27:17,241;Make my own wine.

366;00:27:19,946;00:27:22,413;could drink it.
367;00:27:26,019;00:27:28,586;Tell me a joke,

370;00:27:35,061;00:27:36,794;Right.
371;00:27:38,665;00:27:41,666;Three lords
371;00:27:38,665;00:27:41,666;walk into a tavern--
372;00:27:41,768;00:27:44,268;a Stark, a Martell,
372;00:27:41,768;00:27:44,268;and a Lannister.
373;00:27:44,370;00:27:45,870;They order ale,
374;00:27:45,972;00:27:48,473;but when the barkeep
374;00:27:45,972;00:27:48,473;brings them over,
375;00:27:48,575;00:27:51,075;each of them finds
375;00:27:48,575;00:27:51,075;a fly in his cup.
376;00:27:51,177;00:27:55,513;The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup
376;00:27:51,177;00:27:55,513;aside and demands another.
377;00:27:55,615;00:27:59,784;The Martell plucks the fly out
377;00:27:55,615;00:27:59,784;and swallows it whole.
378;00:28:00,820;00:28:04,522;The Stark reaches
378;00:28:00,820;00:28:04,522;into his cup,
379;00:28:04,624;00:28:07,425;pulls out the fly
379;00:28:04,624;00:28:07,425;and shouts,
380;00:28:07,527;00:28:10,094;Spit it out,
380;00:28:07,527;00:28:10,094;you wee shit.
381;00:28:10,196;00:28:11,529;Spit it out.
382;00:28:17,337;00:28:19,670;It's funnier
382;00:28:17,337;00:28:19,670;in Westeros.
383;00:28:19,772;00:28:22,974;The Starks and the Lannisters,
383;00:28:19,772;00:28:22,974;I thought these were enemies.
384;00:28:23,076;00:28:24,108;Yes.
385;00:28:24,210;00:28:27,845;A joke is like a story,
385;00:28:24,210;00:28:27,845;Torgo Nudho.
386;00:28:27,947;00:28:30,081;Not a true story,
386;00:28:27,947;00:28:30,081;necessarily.
387;00:28:30,183;00:28:33,184;A story that's supposed
387;00:28:30,183;00:28:33,184;to make you laugh ideally.
388;00:28:33,286;00:28:35,086;Not at the moment,
388;00:28:33,286;00:28:35,086;perhaps.
389;00:28:35,188;00:28:37,588;Missandei,
389;00:28:35,188;00:28:37,588;do you like the wine?
390;00:28:37,690;00:28:39,123;I do.
391;00:28:39,225;00:28:40,558;Tell a joke.
392;00:28:46,599;00:28:49,433;Two translators
392;00:28:46,599;00:28:49,433;are on a sinking ship.
393;00:28:51,170;00:28:53,137;The first says,
394;00:28:53,239;00:28:55,606;Do you know
394;00:28:53,239;00:28:55,606;how to swim?
395;00:28:55,708;00:29:00,177;The second says, No, but I can shout
395;00:28:55,708;00:29:00,177;for help in 19 languages.
396;00:29:03,216;00:29:05,783;Ah!
397;00:29:09,255;00:29:11,355;That is the worst joke
397;00:29:09,255;00:29:11,355;I ever heard.
398;00:29:11,457;00:29:13,124;You don't even know
398;00:29:11,457;00:29:13,124;what a joke is.
399;00:29:13,226;00:29:16,127;I am soldier all my life.
399;00:29:13,226;00:29:16,127;You think I never hear joke?
400;00:29:16,229;00:29:18,596;You lied to us.
401;00:29:20,166;00:29:21,532;I make joke.
402;00:29:32,145;00:29:33,511;More jokes.
403;00:29:33,613;00:29:35,980;I once walked
403;00:29:33,613;00:29:35,980;into a brothel
404;00:29:36,082;00:29:37,715;with a honeycomb
404;00:29:36,082;00:29:37,715;and a jackass.
405;00:29:37,817;00:29:40,484;The madam says--
406;00:29:52,732;00:29:55,399;The Masters have come
406;00:29:52,732;00:29:55,399;for their property.
407;00:30:13,486;00:30:14,852;Lord Edmure.
408;00:30:16,723;00:30:19,256;I apologize for the way
408;00:30:16,723;00:30:19,256;the Freys treated you.
409;00:30:19,359;00:30:21,626;A man of your birth
409;00:30:19,359;00:30:21,626;deserves better.
410;00:30:21,728;00:30:25,696;You have my word you'll be
410;00:30:21,728;00:30:25,696;properly fed and clothed from now on.
411;00:30:27,700;00:30:29,667;I have your word?
412;00:30:31,871;00:30:34,271;Oh, good.
413;00:30:34,374;00:30:36,407;Good, that's--
414;00:30:36,509;00:30:38,476;that's a fine thing.
415;00:30:40,246;00:30:43,214;My uncle will never
415;00:30:40,246;00:30:43,214;surrender the castle, ser.
416;00:30:43,316;00:30:45,282;Whatever game
416;00:30:43,316;00:30:45,282;you're playing.
417;00:30:45,385;00:30:47,251;The Blackfish
417;00:30:45,385;00:30:47,251;is an old man.
418;00:30:47,353;00:30:49,453;A good death is all
418;00:30:47,353;00:30:49,453;he can hope for.
419;00:30:49,555;00:30:52,623;But you, you have a child
419;00:30:49,555;00:30:52,623;now, I've heard.
420;00:30:54,060;00:30:56,560;A son you sired
420;00:30:54,060;00:30:56,560;on your wedding night.
421;00:30:56,663;00:30:58,462;You're a potent man.
422;00:30:58,564;00:31:00,898;A son I've never met
423;00:31:01,000;00:31:03,734;born of a wife
423;00:31:01,000;00:31:03,734;that I haven't seen
424;00:31:03,836;00:31:05,169;since our first
424;00:31:03,836;00:31:05,169;night together.
425;00:31:05,271;00:31:06,804;You should be
425;00:31:05,271;00:31:06,804;with them both.
426;00:31:08,007;00:31:10,174;I can arrange that,
426;00:31:08,007;00:31:10,174;you realize?
427;00:31:10,276;00:31:12,309;Comfortable rooms for you
427;00:31:10,276;00:31:12,309;at Casterly Rock.
428;00:31:12,412;00:31:15,613;A tutor for your boy, knights to train him
428;00:31:12,412;00:31:15,613;to fight and to ride.
429;00:31:15,715;00:31:18,149;And when he comes of age,
429;00:31:15,715;00:31:18,149;he'll have a keep of his own.
430;00:31:18,251;00:31:20,685;Do you imagine yourself
430;00:31:18,251;00:31:20,685;a decent person?
431;00:31:20,787;00:31:23,320;Is that it?
432;00:31:23,423;00:31:26,857;After you've massacred
432;00:31:23,423;00:31:26,857;my family.
433;00:31:28,261;00:31:30,061;Kept me in a cell
433;00:31:28,261;00:31:30,061;for years.
434;00:31:30,163;00:31:32,129;Stolen our lands.
435;00:31:32,231;00:31:34,799;I'll remind you that
435;00:31:32,231;00:31:34,799;our houses are at war.
436;00:31:34,901;00:31:37,034;I'm sorry if this conflict
436;00:31:34,901;00:31:37,034;has inconvenienced you,
437;00:31:37,136;00:31:39,637;but rebelling against the Crown
437;00:31:37,136;00:31:39,637;does have consequences.
438;00:31:39,739;00:31:41,939;Says the man who shoved his sword
438;00:31:39,739;00:31:41,939;through his king's back.
439;00:31:42,041;00:31:44,842;Did I give you the impression
439;00:31:42,041;00:31:44,842;that this was a negotiation?
440;00:31:44,944;00:31:46,177;It's not.
441;00:31:48,681;00:31:51,582;You understand.
441;00:31:48,681;00:31:51,582;On some level you understand
442;00:31:51,684;00:31:53,617;that you're an evil man.
443;00:31:53,720;00:31:55,352;I'll leave the judgments
443;00:31:53,720;00:31:55,352;to the gods.
444;00:31:55,455;00:31:57,755;Well, that is
444;00:31:55,455;00:31:57,755;convenient for you.
445;00:32:01,060;00:32:04,662;You're a fine-looking
445;00:32:01,060;00:32:04,662;fellow, aren't you?
446;00:32:07,266;00:32:09,834;Your square jaw,
447;00:32:09,936;00:32:11,702;your golden armor.
448;00:32:13,372;00:32:16,474;Tell me, I want to know.
449;00:32:16,576;00:32:18,142;I truly do.
450;00:32:18,244;00:32:19,710;How do you live
450;00:32:18,244;00:32:19,710;with yourself?
451;00:32:23,449;00:32:25,583;All of us have to believe
452;00:32:25,685;00:32:28,686;that we're decent,
452;00:32:25,685;00:32:28,686;don't we?
453;00:32:28,788;00:32:31,956;You have to sleep
453;00:32:28,788;00:32:31,956;at night.
454;00:32:32,058;00:32:34,492;How do you tell yourself
455;00:32:34,594;00:32:37,194;that you're decent
456;00:32:37,296;00:32:39,797;after everything
456;00:32:37,296;00:32:39,797;that you've done?
457;00:32:45,605;00:32:47,972;I was your sister's
457;00:32:45,605;00:32:47,972;prisoner once.
458;00:32:51,244;00:32:54,712;She hit me on the head with a rock
458;00:32:51,244;00:32:54,712;if I remember correctly.
459;00:32:57,450;00:32:59,283;Yeah.
460;00:33:00,987;00:33:02,286;She should have
460;00:33:00,987;00:33:02,286;killed you.
461;00:33:02,388;00:33:04,255;Perhaps,
461;00:33:02,388;00:33:04,255;but she didn't.
462;00:33:05,658;00:33:09,393;Catelyn Stark hated me
462;00:33:05,658;00:33:09,393;just like you hate me.
463;00:33:09,495;00:33:11,762;But I didn't hate her.
464;00:33:11,864;00:33:13,430;I admired her.
465;00:33:13,533;00:33:15,399;Far more than her husband
465;00:33:13,533;00:33:15,399;or her son.
466;00:33:15,501;00:33:17,768;Do you think I care
466;00:33:15,501;00:33:17,768;whom you admire and whom you don't?
467;00:33:17,870;00:33:20,510;No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway
467;00:33:17,870;00:33:20,510;because you're my prisoner.
468;00:33:20,540;00:33:22,773;You don't have a choice.
469;00:33:22,875;00:33:24,875;The love she had
469;00:33:22,875;00:33:24,875;for her children,
470;00:33:24,977;00:33:26,944;I was a little
470;00:33:24,977;00:33:26,944;awed by it.
471;00:33:27,046;00:33:29,413;Reminded me
471;00:33:27,046;00:33:29,413;of my sister.
472;00:33:29,515;00:33:32,650;Oh.
472;00:33:29,515;00:33:32,650;Oh, I see.
473;00:33:34,487;00:33:36,287;You're a madman.
474;00:33:36,389;00:33:38,255;I'm not here
474;00:33:36,389;00:33:38,255;to trade insults.
475;00:33:38,357;00:33:40,858;Your sister was a strong--
475;00:33:38,357;00:33:40,858;Don't talk about Cat!
476;00:33:40,960;00:33:44,862;I'll talk about whomever I want.
477;00:33:45,898;00:33:47,965;She loved her children.
478;00:33:48,067;00:33:50,634;I suppose
478;00:33:48,067;00:33:50,634;all mothers do,
479;00:33:50,736;00:33:53,470;but Catelyn and Cersei,
480;00:33:53,573;00:33:55,639;there's a fierceness
480;00:33:53,573;00:33:55,639;you don't often see.
481;00:33:55,741;00:33:58,542;They'd do anything
481;00:33:55,741;00:33:58,542;to protect their babies.
482;00:33:58,644;00:34:00,444;Start a war.
483;00:34:00,546;00:34:04,315;Burn cities to ash.
483;00:34:00,546;00:34:04,315;Free their worst enemies.
484;00:34:04,417;00:34:06,584;The things we do for love.
485;00:34:10,923;00:34:14,692;You didn't come here
485;00:34:10,923;00:34:14,692;to talk about our sisters.
486;00:34:14,794;00:34:17,695;That's exactly
486;00:34:14,794;00:34:17,695;why I came here.
487;00:34:19,298;00:34:21,465;I love Cersei.
488;00:34:21,567;00:34:23,601;You can laugh
488;00:34:21,567;00:34:23,601;at that if you want.
489;00:34:23,703;00:34:25,769;You can sneer.
489;00:34:23,703;00:34:25,769;Doesn't matter.
490;00:34:25,872;00:34:27,738;She needs me.
491;00:34:27,840;00:34:31,675;And to get back to her,
491;00:34:27,840;00:34:31,675;I have to take Riverrun.
492;00:34:35,114;00:34:38,249;I'll send
492;00:34:35,114;00:34:38,249;for your baby boy.
493;00:34:38,351;00:34:41,619;And I'll launch him into Riverrun
493;00:34:38,351;00:34:41,619;with a catapult.
494;00:34:41,721;00:34:45,022;Because you don't matter
494;00:34:41,721;00:34:45,022;to me, Lord Edmure.
495;00:34:45,124;00:34:47,691;Your son
495;00:34:45,124;00:34:47,691;doesn't matter to me.
496;00:34:47,793;00:34:51,462;The people in the castle
496;00:34:47,793;00:34:51,462;don't matter to me.
497;00:34:52,598;00:34:54,698;Only Cersei.
498;00:34:56,235;00:34:58,836;And if I have to
498;00:34:56,235;00:34:58,836;slaughter every Tully
499;00:34:58,938;00:35:02,006;who ever lived
499;00:34:58,938;00:35:02,006;to get back to her,
500;00:35:02,108;00:35:04,608;that's what I'll do.
501;00:35:31,570;00:35:34,138;Who goes there?
502;00:35:34,240;00:35:35,973;Edmure Tully,
503;00:35:36,075;00:35:37,541;son of Hoster Tully
504;00:35:37,643;00:35:40,010;and the rightful
504;00:35:37,643;00:35:40,010;Lord of Riverrun.
505;00:35:42,415;00:35:44,281;I demand entry.
506;00:35:44,383;00:35:47,184;Don't let him in.
507;00:35:47,286;00:35:49,653;He's the Lord
507;00:35:47,286;00:35:49,653;of Riverrun.
508;00:35:49,755;00:35:50,988;I have to obey
508;00:35:49,755;00:35:50,988;his commands.
509;00:35:51,090;00:35:52,690;He's been their captive
510;00:35:52,792;00:35:55,592;ever since they murdered
510;00:35:52,792;00:35:55,592;his king at the Red Wedding.
511;00:35:55,695;00:35:58,729;Why do you think the people who murdered
511;00:35:55,695;00:35:58,729;his king at the Red Wedding
512;00:35:58,831;00:36:02,099;would decide
512;00:35:58,831;00:36:02,099;to let him come home?
513;00:36:02,201;00:36:05,369;Because it's a trap,
513;00:36:02,201;00:36:05,369;you idiot.
514;00:36:05,471;00:36:06,770;Don't let him in.
515;00:36:06,872;00:36:08,572;He's my lord,
515;00:36:06,872;00:36:08,572;my lord.
516;00:36:08,674;00:36:11,442;I've sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun
516;00:36:08,674;00:36:11,442;and obey his commands.
517;00:36:11,544;00:36:14,345;You're not obeying
517;00:36:11,544;00:36:14,345;Edmure's commands.
518;00:36:14,447;00:36:18,415;You're obeying the fucking
518;00:36:14,447;00:36:18,415;Kingslayer's commands.
519;00:36:18,517;00:36:21,185;I demand entry.
520;00:36:21,287;00:36:22,653;My lord has given
520;00:36:21,287;00:36:22,653;an order.
521;00:36:22,755;00:36:24,755;With a knife
521;00:36:22,755;00:36:24,755;to his throat.
522;00:36:24,857;00:36:27,291;That is not
522;00:36:24,857;00:36:27,291;a valid order.
523;00:36:32,031;00:36:34,131;Lower the drawbridge
523;00:36:32,031;00:36:34,131;and open the gate for Lord Ed--
524;00:36:34,233;00:36:36,500;Aye, ser.
525;00:36:36,602;00:36:40,137;I'll have your head
525;00:36:36,602;00:36:40,137;before I surrender Riverrun.
526;00:36:40,239;00:36:43,907;You are not lord
526;00:36:40,239;00:36:43,907;of this castle, my lord.
527;00:36:55,621;00:36:58,489;Lower the drawbridge.
527;00:36:55,621;00:36:58,489;- Aye, ser!
528;00:37:42,935;00:37:44,601;If you're wrong,
529;00:37:44,703;00:37:48,372;we've just surrendered
529;00:37:44,703;00:37:48,372;our most valuable prisoner.
530;00:38:28,314;00:38:30,147;Welcome home,
530;00:38:28,314;00:38:30,147;my lord.
531;00:38:34,887;00:38:38,122;Command all the forces
531;00:38:34,887;00:38:38,122;within the castle to lay down their arms.
532;00:38:40,259;00:38:41,992;Open the gates.
533;00:38:42,094;00:38:44,928;My lord--
533;00:38:42,094;00:38:44,928;Your lord has given a command.
534;00:39:18,931;00:39:21,965;Infantry, advance!
535;00:39:35,114;00:39:37,881;Find the Blackfish.
536;00:39:37,983;00:39:41,218;Put him in irons
536;00:39:37,983;00:39:41,218;and hand him over to the Freys.
537;00:39:45,057;00:39:46,890;Find him.
538;00:40:11,784;00:40:13,884;Go on.
539;00:40:13,986;00:40:15,219;Come with us.
540;00:40:15,321;00:40:16,853;I've run before
540;00:40:15,321;00:40:16,853;from the Red Wedding.
541;00:40:16,956;00:40:19,256;I'm not running again.
541;00:40:16,956;00:40:19,256;This is my family home.
542;00:40:19,358;00:40:22,993;Your family is in the North.
542;00:40:19,358;00:40:22,993;Come with us.
543;00:40:23,095;00:40:26,129;Don't die for pride
543;00:40:23,095;00:40:26,129;when you can fight for your blood.
544;00:40:27,766;00:40:31,401;You'll serve Sansa
544;00:40:27,766;00:40:31,401;far better than I ever could.
545;00:40:36,542;00:40:38,075;All the way down!
546;00:40:38,177;00:40:40,978;Check that out!
546;00:40:38,177;00:40:40,978;Go on, now.
547;00:40:41,080;00:40:44,081;I haven't had a proper
547;00:40:41,080;00:40:44,081;sword fight in years.
548;00:40:44,183;00:40:46,917;I expect I'll make
548;00:40:44,183;00:40:46,917;a damn fool of myself.
549;00:41:20,953;00:41:23,687;We found the Blackfish,
549;00:41:20,953;00:41:23,687;my lord.
550;00:41:23,789;00:41:25,355;Good.
551;00:41:25,457;00:41:27,758;Bring him to me.
552;00:41:27,860;00:41:30,260;He died fighting,
552;00:41:27,860;00:41:30,260;my lord.
553;00:43:00,486;00:43:02,586;I was wrong. I admit it.
553;00:43:00,486;00:43:02,586;That changes nothing.
554;00:43:02,688;00:43:05,088;The Unsullied could mount
554;00:43:02,688;00:43:05,088;a defense off the beachhead.
555;00:43:05,190;00:43:06,102;If the slavers' forces--
556;00:43:06,126;00:43:08,166;No more talking from you.
556;00:43:06,126;00:43:08,166;Your talking gave us this.
557;00:43:08,394;00:43:10,034;And I have acknowledged that.
557;00:43:08,394;00:43:10,034;I'm trying--
558;00:43:10,062;00:43:11,982;You're trying to tell me
558;00:43:10,062;00:43:11,982;what the army should do.
559;00:43:12,064;00:43:14,498;You do not know
559;00:43:12,064;00:43:14,498;what the army should do.
560;00:43:14,600;00:43:16,767;All right, what should
560;00:43:14,600;00:43:16,767;the army do?
561;00:43:16,869;00:43:18,635;We'll not go
561;00:43:16,869;00:43:18,635;to the beach.
562;00:43:18,737;00:43:21,037;If we go to the beach,
562;00:43:18,737;00:43:21,037;the Masters will take the pyramid.
563;00:43:21,140;00:43:23,573;The pyramid is the only place
563;00:43:21,140;00:43:23,573;in the city we can defend.
564;00:43:23,675;00:43:25,108;We stay here.
564;00:43:23,675;00:43:25,108;And then?
565;00:43:25,210;00:43:27,010;We wait for them
565;00:43:25,210;00:43:27,010;to come to us.
566;00:43:27,112;00:43:29,312;Then we fight them.
567;00:44:39,485;00:44:41,184;Clegane.
568;00:44:41,286;00:44:43,386;What the fuck
568;00:44:41,286;00:44:43,386;you doing here?
569;00:44:43,489;00:44:45,589;Chasing them.
569;00:44:43,489;00:44:45,589;You?
570;00:44:45,691;00:44:47,524;Hanging them.
571;00:44:47,626;00:44:49,326;Any particular
571;00:44:47,626;00:44:49,326;reason?
572;00:44:49,428;00:44:51,795;They're our men.
572;00:44:49,428;00:44:51,795;Or they were.
573;00:44:51,897;00:44:54,464;They attacked a nearby Sept
573;00:44:51,897;00:44:54,464;and murdered the villagers.
574;00:44:54,566;00:44:55,732;Why do you want them?
575;00:44:55,834;00:44:57,334;Same reason.
576;00:44:57,436;00:44:59,469;I was helping build it.
577;00:44:59,571;00:45:01,805;They killed
577;00:44:59,571;00:45:01,805;a friend of mine.
578;00:45:01,907;00:45:03,173;You've got friends?
579;00:45:03,275;00:45:06,142;Not anymore.
579;00:45:03,275;00:45:06,142;They're mine.
580;00:45:06,245;00:45:08,845;It's the Brotherhood's good name
580;00:45:06,245;00:45:08,845;they've dragged through the dirt.
581;00:45:08,881;00:45:10,580;Fuck your name.
581;00:45:08,881;00:45:10,580;They're mine.
582;00:45:10,682;00:45:12,215;I killed you once
582;00:45:10,682;00:45:12,215;before, Dondarrion.
583;00:45:12,317;00:45:14,284;Happy to do it again.
584;00:45:14,386;00:45:16,653;Drop that arrow,
584;00:45:14,386;00:45:16,653;you bloody girl.
585;00:45:18,056;00:45:20,490;Tougher girls than you
585;00:45:18,056;00:45:20,490;have tried to kill me.
586;00:45:22,761;00:45:24,060;You can have
586;00:45:22,761;00:45:24,060;one of them.
587;00:45:28,901;00:45:30,267;Two.
588;00:45:42,014;00:45:44,014;No, no, no.
589;00:45:44,116;00:45:46,583;We're not butchers.
589;00:45:44,116;00:45:46,583;We hang them.
590;00:45:46,685;00:45:48,318;Hanging?
591;00:45:48,420;00:45:49,819;All over
591;00:45:48,420;00:45:49,819;in an instant.
592;00:45:49,922;00:45:51,354;Where's the punishment
592;00:45:49,922;00:45:51,354;in that?
593;00:45:51,456;00:45:54,057;They die.
593;00:45:51,456;00:45:54,057;We all bloody die.
594;00:45:54,159;00:45:56,626;Except this one here.
595;00:45:56,728;00:45:58,795;I'll only gut
595;00:45:56,728;00:45:58,795;one of them.
596;00:45:58,897;00:46:01,331;No.
597;00:46:01,433;00:46:03,199;I'll chop off one hand.
598;00:46:03,302;00:46:06,369;We gave you two of the three out of
598;00:46:03,302;00:46:06,369;respect for your loss.
599;00:46:06,471;00:46:07,871;That's generous.
600;00:46:11,643;00:46:14,711;Bunch of nancies.
601;00:46:14,813;00:46:17,314;There was a time I would
601;00:46:14,813;00:46:17,314;have killed all seven of you
602;00:46:17,416;00:46:18,582;just to gut these three.
603;00:46:18,684;00:46:19,983;You're getting old,
603;00:46:18,684;00:46:19,983;Clegane.
604;00:46:20,085;00:46:21,551;He's not.
605;00:46:23,655;00:46:26,189;Please don't.
605;00:46:23,655;00:46:26,189;I'll give you anything.
606;00:46:54,786;00:46:56,653;Got anything to eat?
607;00:47:08,934;00:47:11,101;Enjoying yourself?
608;00:47:11,203;00:47:13,269;I prefer chicken.
609;00:47:14,706;00:47:18,041;You ought to join us.
609;00:47:14,706;00:47:18,041;We could use you.
610;00:47:19,344;00:47:21,811;I tried joining.
610;00:47:19,344;00:47:21,811;Didn't work out for me.
611;00:47:21,913;00:47:24,848;Clegane, we're here
611;00:47:21,913;00:47:24,848;for a reason.
612;00:47:26,418;00:47:29,786;The Lord of Light
612;00:47:26,418;00:47:29,786;is keeping Beric alive for a reason.
613;00:47:29,888;00:47:32,255;He gave a failed,
613;00:47:29,888;00:47:32,255;drunk priest
614;00:47:32,357;00:47:35,091;the power to bring him
614;00:47:32,357;00:47:35,091;back for a reason.
615;00:47:35,193;00:47:37,527;We are part of something
615;00:47:35,193;00:47:37,527;larger than ourselves.
616;00:47:37,629;00:47:40,797;Lots of horrible shit
616;00:47:37,629;00:47:40,797;in this world gets done
617;00:47:40,899;00:47:42,966;for something larger
617;00:47:40,899;00:47:42,966;than ourselves.
618;00:47:50,275;00:47:53,276;Cold winds
618;00:47:50,275;00:47:53,276;are rising in the North.
619;00:47:53,378;00:47:55,679;And you're going
619;00:47:53,378;00:47:55,679;to go stop them?
620;00:47:56,815;00:47:58,348;We need good men
620;00:47:56,815;00:47:58,348;to help us.
621;00:47:58,450;00:48:02,218;Last time you saw me,
621;00:47:58,450;00:48:02,218;you wanted to execute me.
622;00:48:03,855;00:48:05,455;True enough.
623;00:48:05,557;00:48:08,625;But the Lord of Light
623;00:48:05,557;00:48:08,625;gave you the power to defeat me.
624;00:48:08,727;00:48:11,227;Why?
625;00:48:11,329;00:48:14,230;I beat you because I'm better
625;00:48:11,329;00:48:14,230;than you, Beric.
626;00:48:14,332;00:48:18,568;I was better than you before you started
626;00:48:14,332;00:48:18,568;yammering on about the Lord
627;00:48:18,670;00:48:21,638;and I'm better
627;00:48:18,670;00:48:21,638;than you now.
628;00:48:21,740;00:48:23,540;Aye, you're
628;00:48:21,740;00:48:23,540;probably right.
629;00:48:23,642;00:48:26,476;You're a fighter.
630;00:48:26,578;00:48:28,812;You were born a fighter.
631;00:48:28,914;00:48:31,314;You walked away
631;00:48:28,914;00:48:31,314;from the fight.
632;00:48:31,416;00:48:33,083;How did that go?
633;00:48:35,887;00:48:39,155;Good and bad,
633;00:48:35,887;00:48:39,155;young and old,
634;00:48:39,257;00:48:42,025;the things we're fighting
634;00:48:39,257;00:48:42,025;will destroy them all alike.
635;00:48:43,862;00:48:47,097;You can still help a lot more
635;00:48:43,862;00:48:47,097;than you've harmed, Clegane.
636;00:48:47,199;00:48:49,099;It's not too late
636;00:48:47,199;00:48:49,099;for you.
637;00:49:52,898;00:49:54,697;Lady Crane?
638;00:50:02,941;00:50:04,808;Lady Crane?
639;00:50:11,082;00:50:14,851;If you'd have done your job,
639;00:50:11,082;00:50:14,851;she would have died painlessly.
640;00:50:17,088;00:50:19,189;Instead...
641;00:50:21,259;00:50:23,726;The Many-Faced God
641;00:50:21,259;00:50:23,726;was promised a name.
642;00:50:25,130;00:50:27,230;He must always
642;00:50:25,130;00:50:27,230;receive what is his.
643;00:50:27,332;00:50:30,033;You can't change that.
644;00:50:30,135;00:50:32,569;I can't change that.
645;00:50:32,671;00:50:34,704;No one can.
646;00:50:37,342;00:50:39,809;And now he's been
646;00:50:37,342;00:50:39,809;promised another name.
647;00:50:55,360;00:50:57,560;Hey!
647;00:50:55,360;00:50:57,560;Get out!
648;00:51:00,432;00:51:02,365;Yah!
649;00:52:21,880;00:52:23,613;Hey!
650;00:52:26,418;00:52:28,251;Yah!
651;00:52:29,321;00:52:30,853;Ah!
652;00:52:42,968;00:52:45,301;My basket!
653;00:54:19,330;00:54:20,897;It will all
653;00:54:19,330;00:54:20,897;be over soon.
654;00:54:22,333;00:54:25,134;On your knees
654;00:54:22,333;00:54:25,134;or on your feet?
655;00:54:35,880;00:54:38,114;Haven't we been
655;00:54:35,880;00:54:38,114;through this already?
656;00:54:40,285;00:54:42,051;That won't help you.
657;00:55:53,758;00:55:55,791;You told her to kill me.
658;00:56:02,500;00:56:04,133;Yes.
659;00:56:04,235;00:56:06,702;But here you are.
660;00:56:06,804;00:56:09,505;And there she is.
661;00:56:19,717;00:56:22,585;Finally a girl
661;00:56:19,717;00:56:22,585;is no one.
662;00:56:25,990;00:56:29,492;A girl is Arya Stark
662;00:56:25,990;00:56:29,492;of Winterfell
663;00:56:29,594;00:56:31,727;and I'm going home.
