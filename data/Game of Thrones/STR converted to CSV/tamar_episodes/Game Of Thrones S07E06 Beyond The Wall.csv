128;00:09:33,590;00:09:36,540;were shooting arrows
128;00:09:33,590;00:09:36,540;with Ser Rodrik.
129;00:09:37,880;00:09:40,169;I came out here after,
130;00:09:40,170;00:09:42,419;and Bran had
130;00:09:40,170;00:09:42,419;left his bow behind,
131;00:09:42,420;00:09:45,040;just lying on the ground.
132;00:09:45,050;00:09:47,430;Ser Rodrik would have
132;00:09:45,050;00:09:47,430;cuffed him if he saw.
133;00:09:49,920;00:09:52,999;There was one arrow
133;00:09:49,920;00:09:52,999;in the target.
134;00:09:53,000;00:09:56,669;There was no one around,
134;00:09:53,000;00:09:56,669;just like now.
135;00:09:56,670;00:09:58,540;No one to stop me.
136;00:10:00,500;00:10:02,169;So I started shooting.
137;00:10:02,170;00:10:04,540;And every shot,
137;00:10:02,170;00:10:04,540;I had to go up there
138;00:10:04,550;00:10:07,850;and get my one arrow
138;00:10:04,550;00:10:07,850;and walk back and
138;00:10:04,550;00:10:07,850;shoot it again.
139;00:10:09,340;00:10:11,090;I wasn't very good.
140;00:10:12,630;00:10:15,629;Finally,
140;00:10:12,630;00:10:15,629;I hit the bull's-eye.
141;00:10:15,630;00:10:18,040;Could have been
141;00:10:15,630;00:10:18,040;the 20th shot or the 50th.
142;00:10:18,050;00:10:19,499;I don't remember.
143;00:10:19,500;00:10:22,920;But I hit the bull's-eye,
143;00:10:19,500;00:10:22,920;and I heard this.
144;00:10:25,340;00:10:26,839;I looked up,
145;00:10:26,840;00:10:28,589;and he's standing right here,
146;00:10:28,590;00:10:30,250;smiling down at me.
147;00:10:32,750;00:10:35,839;I knew what I was doing
147;00:10:32,750;00:10:35,839;was against the rules.
148;00:10:35,840;00:10:40,249;But he was smiling,
148;00:10:35,840;00:10:40,249;so I knew it wasn't wrong.
149;00:10:40,250;00:10:41,790;The rules were wrong.
150;00:10:43,420;00:10:46,460;I was doing what I was
150;00:10:43,420;00:10:46,460;meant to be doing,
150;00:10:43,420;00:10:46,460;and he knew it.
151;00:10:49,340;00:10:51,090;Now he's dead.
152;00:10:52,590;00:10:54,839;Killed by the Lannisters
153;00:10:54,840;00:10:56,460;with your help.
154;00:11:00,130;00:11:01,380;What?
155;00:11:11,130;00:11:13,339;That's your pretty handwriting.
156;00:11:13,340;00:11:15,169;Septa Mordane
156;00:11:13,340;00:11:15,169;used to crack my knuckles
157;00:11:15,170;00:11:16,920;'cause I couldn't write
157;00:11:15,170;00:11:16,920;as well as you.
158;00:11:19,000;00:11:22,959;Robb, I write to you today
158;00:11:19,000;00:11:22,959;with heavy heart.
159;00:11:22,960;00:11:25,129;Our good King Robert is dead,
160;00:11:25,130;00:11:26,959;killed from wounds
160;00:11:25,130;00:11:26,959;he took in a boar hunt.
161;00:11:26,960;00:11:28,459;You don't have
161;00:11:26,960;00:11:28,459;to read it.
161;00:11:26,960;00:11:28,459;I remember.
162;00:11:28,460;00:11:30,169;Father has been
162;00:11:28,460;00:11:30,169;charged with treason.
163;00:11:30,170;00:11:33,129;He conspired
163;00:11:30,170;00:11:33,129;with Robert's brothers
163;00:11:30,170;00:11:33,129;against my beloved Joffrey
164;00:11:33,130;00:11:34,959;and tried to steal his throne.
165;00:11:34,960;00:11:36,790;The Lannisters
165;00:11:34,960;00:11:36,790;are treating me well
166;00:11:36,800;00:11:38,799;and providing me
166;00:11:36,800;00:11:38,799;with every comfort.
167;00:11:38,800;00:11:41,135;I beg you,
167;00:11:38,800;00:11:41,135;come to King's Landing,
168;00:11:41,136;00:11:42,999;swear fealty to King Joffrey,
169;00:11:43,000;00:11:45,209;and prevent any strife
169;00:11:43,000;00:11:45,209;between the great houses
170;00:11:45,210;00:11:46,999;of Lannister and Stark.
171;00:11:47,000;00:11:49,209;Your faithful sister,
171;00:11:47,000;00:11:49,209;Sansa.
172;00:11:49,210;00:11:51,629;They forced me to do it.
173;00:11:51,630;00:11:52,790;Did they?
174;00:11:52,800;00:11:55,089;With a knife at your throat?
175;00:11:55,090;00:11:56,540;Did they put you
175;00:11:55,090;00:11:56,540;on a rack and stretch you
176;00:11:56,550;00:11:58,249;until your bones started to pop?
177;00:11:58,250;00:12:00,169;You don't know
177;00:11:58,250;00:12:00,169;what it was like.
177;00:11:58,250;00:12:00,169;I was a child.
178;00:12:00,170;00:12:03,999;So was I.
178;00:12:00,170;00:12:03,999;I would have let them kill me
178;00:12:00,170;00:12:03,999;before I betrayed my family.
179;00:12:04,000;00:12:06,839;They told me it was
179;00:12:04,000;00:12:06,839;the only way to save Father.
180;00:12:06,840;00:12:09,380;And you were stupid enough
180;00:12:06,840;00:12:09,380;to believe them.
181;00:12:11,130;00:12:14,339;I remember you
181;00:12:11,130;00:12:14,339;standing on that platform
181;00:12:11,130;00:12:14,339;with Joffrey and Cersei
182;00:12:14,340;00:12:16,040;when they dragged
182;00:12:14,340;00:12:16,040;Father to the block.
183;00:12:16,050;00:12:17,680;I remember the pretty dress
183;00:12:16,050;00:12:17,680;you were wearing.
184;00:12:17,681;00:12:20,040;I remember the fancy way
184;00:12:17,681;00:12:20,040;you did your hair.
185;00:12:21,880;00:12:22,999;You were there?
186;00:12:23,000;00:12:24,290;I was there.
187;00:12:24,300;00:12:27,180;Standing in the crowd
187;00:12:24,300;00:12:27,180;near Baelor's statue.
188;00:12:27,181;00:12:28,959;And what did you do?
189;00:12:28,960;00:12:31,379;Did you come
189;00:12:28,960;00:12:31,379;running to the rescue?
190;00:12:31,380;00:12:34,169;Did you fight off
190;00:12:31,380;00:12:34,169;the Lannisters and
190;00:12:31,380;00:12:34,169;save Father?
191;00:12:34,170;00:12:36,790;I wanted to.
191;00:12:34,170;00:12:36,790;But you didn't,
191;00:12:34,170;00:12:36,790;just like me.
192;00:12:36,800;00:12:39,385;I didn't betray him.
192;00:12:36,800;00:12:39,385;I didn't betray Robb.
193;00:12:39,386;00:12:43,040;I didn't betray
193;00:12:39,386;00:12:43,040;our entire family
193;00:12:39,386;00:12:43,040;for my beloved Joffrey.
194;00:12:45,380;00:12:48,379;You should be
194;00:12:45,380;00:12:48,379;on your knees,
194;00:12:45,380;00:12:48,379;thanking me.
195;00:12:48,380;00:12:52,249;We're standing
195;00:12:48,380;00:12:52,249;in Winterfell again
195;00:12:48,380;00:12:52,249;because of me.
196;00:12:52,250;00:12:54,459;You didn't win it back,
196;00:12:52,250;00:12:54,459;Jon didn't win it back.
197;00:12:54,460;00:12:56,540;He lost the Battle
197;00:12:54,460;00:12:56,540;of the Bastards.
198;00:12:56,550;00:12:58,299;The Knights of the Vale
198;00:12:56,550;00:12:58,299;won the battle,
199;00:12:58,300;00:12:59,930;and they rode north for me.
200;00:12:59,931;00:13:03,209;While you were off, where?
200;00:12:59,931;00:13:03,209;Traveling the world?
201;00:13:03,210;00:13:06,040;I was training.
201;00:13:03,210;00:13:06,040;Training.
202;00:13:06,050;00:13:07,930;Well, while you were training,
203;00:13:07,931;00:13:11,169;I suffered things
203;00:13:07,931;00:13:11,169;you could never imagine.
204;00:13:11,170;00:13:13,790;Oh, I don't know about that.
204;00:13:11,170;00:13:13,790;I can imagine quite a lot.
205;00:13:15,630;00:13:18,540;You never would have
205;00:13:15,630;00:13:18,540;survived what I survived.
206;00:13:18,550;00:13:21,140;I guess we'll never know.
207;00:13:25,250;00:13:27,090;What are you going to do
207;00:13:25,250;00:13:27,090;with that letter?
208;00:13:28,590;00:13:30,040;I don't know yet.
209;00:13:31,590;00:13:34,379;Who did you show it to?
209;00:13:31,590;00:13:34,379;Where did you find it?
210;00:13:34,380;00:13:36,459;You're scared, aren't you?
211;00:13:36,460;00:13:38,589;What are you scared of?
212;00:13:38,590;00:13:40,589;You didn't commit any crimes.
213;00:13:40,590;00:13:42,419;No one's going to hang you.
213;00:13:40,590;00:13:42,419;Well, Arya--
214;00:13:42,420;00:13:44,879;You're scared
214;00:13:42,420;00:13:44,879;I'll show it to Jon
214;00:13:42,420;00:13:44,879;and he'll be angry.
215;00:13:44,880;00:13:48,249;No, that's not Jon.
215;00:13:44,880;00:13:48,249;He'll understand.
216;00:13:48,250;00:13:50,209;You were just
216;00:13:48,250;00:13:50,209;a scared little girl,
217;00:13:50,210;00:13:52,419;all alone with
217;00:13:50,210;00:13:52,419;the wicked Lannisters.
218;00:13:52,420;00:13:56,290;Do you know how happy
218;00:13:52,420;00:13:56,290;Cersei would be right now
218;00:13:52,420;00:13:56,290;if she saw us fighting?
219;00:13:56,300;00:13:58,299;This is exactly what she wants.
220;00:13:58,300;00:14:00,390;This is what
220;00:13:58,300;00:14:00,390;she's always wanted--
220;00:13:58,300;00:14:00,390;to tear us apart.
221;00:14:00,391;00:14:02,960;You're scared
221;00:14:00,391;00:14:02,960;the Northern lords
221;00:14:00,391;00:14:02,960;will read it.
222;00:14:04,460;00:14:06,169;They wouldn't think much
222;00:14:04,460;00:14:06,169;of Lady Sansa
223;00:14:06,170;00:14:09,169;if they knew how she did
223;00:14:06,170;00:14:09,169;Cersei's bidding.
224;00:14:09,170;00:14:12,169;What would little
224;00:14:09,170;00:14:12,169;Lyanna Mormont say?
225;00:14:12,170;00:14:15,339;She's younger than you were
225;00:14:12,170;00:14:15,339;when you wrote this.
226;00:14:15,340;00:14:17,840;Are you going to say,
226;00:14:15,340;00:14:17,840;But I was just a child?
227;00:14:20,550;00:14:22,419;You're angry.
228;00:14:22,420;00:14:25,629;Sometimes anger
228;00:14:22,420;00:14:25,629;makes people do
228;00:14:22,420;00:14:25,629;unfortunate things.
229;00:14:25,630;00:14:28,250;Sometimes
229;00:14:25,630;00:14:28,250;fear makes them do
229;00:14:25,630;00:14:28,250;unfortunate things.
230;00:14:30,250;00:14:32,130;I'll go with anger.
231;00:15:02,960;00:15:05,040;You're the one
231;00:15:02,960;00:15:05,040;they call the Dog.
232;00:15:05,050;00:15:06,879;Fuck off.
232;00:15:05,050;00:15:06,879;( chuckles )
233;00:15:06,880;00:15:08,669;They told me you were mean.
234;00:15:08,670;00:15:11,089;Were you born mean
234;00:15:08,670;00:15:11,089;or you just hate wildings?
235;00:15:11,090;00:15:13,459;I don't give two shits
235;00:15:11,090;00:15:13,459;about wildings.
236;00:15:13,460;00:15:15,169;It's gingers I hate.
237;00:15:15,170;00:15:17,040;Gingers are beautiful.
238;00:15:17,050;00:15:20,629;We are kissed by fire,
238;00:15:17,050;00:15:20,629;just like you.
239;00:15:20,630;00:15:23,540;Don't point
239;00:15:20,630;00:15:23,540;your fucking finger at me.
240;00:15:27,800;00:15:30,925;Did you trip into the fire
240;00:15:27,800;00:15:30,925;when you were a baby?
241;00:15:30,926;00:15:32,669;I didn't trip, I was pushed.
242;00:15:32,670;00:15:34,589;And ever since,
242;00:15:32,670;00:15:34,589;you've been mean.
243;00:15:34,590;00:15:36,209;Will you fuck off?
244;00:15:36,210;00:15:38,169;I don't think you're truly mean.
245;00:15:38,170;00:15:39,710;You have sad eyes.
246;00:15:41,000;00:15:42,709;You want to suck my dick,
246;00:15:41,000;00:15:42,709;is that it?
247;00:15:42,710;00:15:45,419;Dick?
247;00:15:42,710;00:15:45,419;Cock.
248;00:15:45,420;00:15:47,419;Ah, dick.
249;00:15:47,420;00:15:48,709;I like it.
250;00:15:48,710;00:15:50,749;I bet you do.
251;00:15:50,750;00:15:53,379;Nope, it's pussy for me.
252;00:15:53,380;00:15:56,379;I have a beauty waiting for me
252;00:15:53,380;00:15:56,379;back at Winterfell.
253;00:15:56,380;00:15:58,499;If I ever get back there.
254;00:15:58,500;00:16:01,249;Yellow hair, blue eyes,
255;00:16:01,250;00:16:03,459;the tallest woman
255;00:16:01,250;00:16:03,459;you've ever seen.
256;00:16:03,460;00:16:04,920;Almost as tall as you.
257;00:16:07,090;00:16:09,249;Brienne of Tarth.
257;00:16:07,090;00:16:09,249;You know her?
258;00:16:09,250;00:16:11,589;You're with Brienne
258;00:16:09,250;00:16:11,589;of fucking Tarth?
259;00:16:11,590;00:16:13,959;Well, not with her yet.
260;00:16:13,960;00:16:17,589;But I see
260;00:16:13,960;00:16:17,589;the way she looks at me.
260;00:16:13,960;00:16:17,589;How does she look at you?
261;00:16:17,590;00:16:20,040;Like she wants
261;00:16:17,590;00:16:20,040;to carve you up
261;00:16:17,590;00:16:20,040;and eat your liver?
262;00:16:20,050;00:16:21,799;You do know her.
263;00:16:21,800;00:16:23,249;We've met.
264;00:16:23,250;00:16:25,379;I want to make babies with her.
265;00:16:25,380;00:16:28,379;Think of them--
265;00:16:25,380;00:16:28,379;great big monsters.
266;00:16:28,380;00:16:29,959;They'd conquer the world.
267;00:16:29,960;00:16:33,540;How did
267;00:16:29,960;00:16:33,540;a mad fucker like you
267;00:16:29,960;00:16:33,540;live this long?
268;00:16:33,550;00:16:35,300;I'm good at killing people.
269;00:16:38,210;00:16:39,839;You don't look much like him.
270;00:16:39,840;00:16:41,290;Who's that?
271;00:16:41,300;00:16:43,339;Your father.
272;00:16:43,340;00:16:45,419;I suppose you favor your mother.
273;00:16:45,420;00:16:47,790;You knew him?
274;00:16:47,800;00:16:49,589;'Course I did.
275;00:16:49,590;00:16:51,169;When he was Hand,
276;00:16:51,170;00:16:53,540;he sent me off hunting
276;00:16:51,170;00:16:53,540;for the Mountain.
277;00:16:53,550;00:16:55,010;Your wildling friend told me
278;00:16:55,011;00:16:57,290;the red woman brought you back.
279;00:16:57,300;00:17:01,459;Thoros has
279;00:16:57,300;00:17:01,459;brought me back
279;00:16:57,300;00:17:01,459;six times.
280;00:17:01,460;00:17:04,540;We both serve the same lord.
281;00:17:04,550;00:17:06,459;I serve the North.
282;00:17:06,460;00:17:08,499;The North didn't
282;00:17:06,460;00:17:08,499;raise you from the dead.
283;00:17:08,500;00:17:10,499;The Lord of Light
283;00:17:08,500;00:17:10,499;never spoke to me.
284;00:17:10,500;00:17:11,879;I don't know anything about him.
285;00:17:11,880;00:17:13,499;I don't know
285;00:17:11,880;00:17:13,499;what he wants from me.
286;00:17:13,500;00:17:16,879;He wants you alive.
286;00:17:13,500;00:17:16,879;Why?
287;00:17:16,880;00:17:19,290;I don't know.
288;00:17:19,300;00:17:22,669;That's all
288;00:17:19,300;00:17:22,669;anyone can tell me--
288;00:17:19,300;00:17:22,669;I don't know.
289;00:17:22,670;00:17:24,499;So, what's the point
289;00:17:22,670;00:17:24,499;in serving a god
290;00:17:24,500;00:17:26,999;if none of us knows
290;00:17:24,500;00:17:26,999;what he wants?
291;00:17:27,000;00:17:29,709;I think about that all the time.
292;00:17:29,710;00:17:32,790;I don't think
292;00:17:29,710;00:17:32,790;it's our purpose
292;00:17:29,710;00:17:32,790;to understand.
293;00:17:32,800;00:17:36,169;Except one thing--
293;00:17:32,800;00:17:36,169;we're soldiers.
294;00:17:36,170;00:17:38,839;We have to know
294;00:17:36,170;00:17:38,839;what we're fighting for.
295;00:17:38,840;00:17:42,040;I'm not fighting
295;00:17:38,840;00:17:42,040;so some man or woman
295;00:17:38,840;00:17:42,040;I barely know
296;00:17:42,050;00:17:45,089;can sit on a throne
296;00:17:42,050;00:17:45,089;made of swords.
297;00:17:45,090;00:17:47,499;So, what are you fighting for?
298;00:17:47,500;00:17:48,670;Life.
299;00:17:50,170;00:17:51,999;Death is the enemy.
300;00:17:52,000;00:17:55,290;The first enemy and the last.
301;00:17:57,130;00:17:58,210;But we all die.
302;00:18:00,210;00:18:02,540;The enemy always wins.
303;00:18:02,550;00:18:04,799;And we still need to fight him.
304;00:18:04,800;00:18:06,749;That's all I know.
305;00:18:06,750;00:18:10,209;You and I
305;00:18:06,750;00:18:10,209;won't find much joy
305;00:18:06,750;00:18:10,209;while we're here,
306;00:18:10,210;00:18:12,459;but we can keep others alive.
307;00:18:12,460;00:18:15,250;We can defend those
307;00:18:12,460;00:18:15,250;who can't defend themselves.
308;00:18:18,550;00:18:21,470;I am the shield that
308;00:18:18,550;00:18:21,470;guards the realms of men.
309;00:18:21,471;00:18:25,290;Maybe we don't
309;00:18:21,471;00:18:25,290;need to understand
309;00:18:21,471;00:18:25,290;any more than that.
310;00:18:25,300;00:18:27,499;Maybe that's enough.
311;00:18:27,500;00:18:28,750;Aye.
312;00:18:30,460;00:18:32,210;Maybe that's enough.
313;00:18:40,000;00:18:42,590;That's what I saw in the fire.
314;00:18:43,750;00:18:45,790;A mountain like an arrowhead.
315;00:18:47,710;00:18:49,130;Thoros:
315;00:18:47,710;00:18:49,130;Are you sure?
316;00:18:52,170;00:18:53,590;We're getting close.
317;00:19:01,590;00:19:03,590;Daenerys:
317;00:19:01,590;00:19:03,590;Do you know
317;00:19:01,590;00:19:03,590;what I like about you?
318;00:19:05,880;00:19:09,089;I honestly don't.
318;00:19:05,880;00:19:09,089;You're not a hero.
319;00:19:09,090;00:19:10,629;Oh.
320;00:19:10,630;00:19:13,419;Well, I've been heroic
320;00:19:10,630;00:19:13,419;on occasion.
321;00:19:13,420;00:19:16,209;I once charged
321;00:19:13,420;00:19:16,209;through the Mud Gate
321;00:19:13,420;00:19:16,209;of King's Landing and--
322;00:19:16,210;00:19:17,999;I don't want you to be a hero.
323;00:19:18,000;00:19:21,290;Heroes do stupid things
323;00:19:18,000;00:19:21,290;and they die.
324;00:19:21,300;00:19:23,339;Drogo, Jorah, Daario,
325;00:19:23,340;00:19:26,629;even this...
325;00:19:23,340;00:19:26,629;Jon Snow--
326;00:19:26,630;00:19:29,290;they all try
326;00:19:26,630;00:19:29,290;to outdo each other.
327;00:19:29,300;00:19:31,470;Who can do the stupidest,
327;00:19:29,300;00:19:31,470;bravest thing.
328;00:19:31,471;00:19:34,459;It's interesting,
328;00:19:31,471;00:19:34,459;these heroes you name.
329;00:19:34,460;00:19:36,669;Drogo, Jorah, Daario,
330;00:19:36,670;00:19:39,589;even this...
330;00:19:36,670;00:19:39,589;Jon Snow.
331;00:19:39,590;00:19:41,709;They all fell in love with you.
332;00:19:41,710;00:19:44,669;Jon Snow's
332;00:19:41,710;00:19:44,669;not in love with me.
332;00:19:41,710;00:19:44,669;Oh, my mistake.
333;00:19:44,670;00:19:46,379;I suppose he stares
333;00:19:44,670;00:19:46,379;at you longingly
334;00:19:46,380;00:19:49,290;because he's
334;00:19:46,380;00:19:49,290;hopeful for a successful
334;00:19:46,380;00:19:49,290;military alliance.
335;00:19:52,800;00:19:55,249;He's too little for me.
336;00:19:55,250;00:19:57,089;I didn't mean--
337;00:19:57,090;00:20:00,249;As heroes go,
337;00:19:57,090;00:20:00,249;he is quite little.
338;00:20:00,250;00:20:02,669;I know you're brave.
339;00:20:02,670;00:20:04,630;I wouldn't have chosen
339;00:20:02,670;00:20:04,630;a coward as my Hand.
340;00:20:09,670;00:20:12,540;So, if all goes well,
341;00:20:12,550;00:20:14,850;I'll finally get
341;00:20:12,550;00:20:14,850;to meet your sister.
342;00:20:16,380;00:20:18,169;From everything
342;00:20:16,380;00:20:18,169;you've told me about her,
343;00:20:18,170;00:20:20,499;she'd rather murder me
343;00:20:18,170;00:20:20,499;than speak with me.
344;00:20:20,500;00:20:24,339;Oh, first,
344;00:20:20,500;00:20:24,339;she'd torture you
344;00:20:20,500;00:20:24,339;in some horrible way,
345;00:20:24,340;00:20:25,460;then she'd murder you.
346;00:20:26,880;00:20:30,379;Nobody trusts my sister
346;00:20:26,880;00:20:30,379;less than I do, believe me.
347;00:20:30,380;00:20:32,169;But if we go to the capital,
348;00:20:32,170;00:20:34,999;we'll go with two armies,
348;00:20:32,170;00:20:34,999;we'll go with three dragons.
349;00:20:35,000;00:20:38,749;Anyone touches you,
349;00:20:35,000;00:20:38,749;King's Landing burns
349;00:20:35,000;00:20:38,749;down to the foundation stones.
350;00:20:38,750;00:20:40,790;And right now,
350;00:20:38,750;00:20:40,790;she's thinking
350;00:20:38,750;00:20:40,790;of how to set a trap.
351;00:20:40,800;00:20:42,379;Of course she is.
352;00:20:42,380;00:20:44,669;And she's wondering
352;00:20:42,380;00:20:44,669;what trap you're laying
352;00:20:42,380;00:20:44,669;for her.
353;00:20:44,670;00:20:46,129;Are we?
354;00:20:46,130;00:20:48,290;Laying any traps?
355;00:20:50,300;00:20:53,629;If we want to create
355;00:20:50,300;00:20:53,629;a new and better world,
356;00:20:53,630;00:20:56,749;I'm not sure
356;00:20:53,630;00:20:56,749;deceit and mass murder
356;00:20:53,630;00:20:56,749;is the best way to start.
357;00:20:56,750;00:20:59,540;Which war was won without
357;00:20:56,750;00:20:59,540;deceit and mass murder?
358;00:21:01,210;00:21:03,339;Yes, you'll need to be ruthless
359;00:21:03,340;00:21:05,209;if you're going
359;00:21:03,340;00:21:05,209;to win the throne.
360;00:21:05,210;00:21:07,249;You need to inspire
360;00:21:05,210;00:21:07,249;a degree of fear.
361;00:21:07,250;00:21:09,629;But fear is all Cersei has.
362;00:21:09,630;00:21:12,459;It's all my father had,
362;00:21:09,630;00:21:12,459;and Joffrey.
363;00:21:12,460;00:21:14,379;It makes their power brittle
364;00:21:14,380;00:21:18,169;because everyone beneath them
364;00:21:14,380;00:21:18,169;longs to see them dead.
365;00:21:18,170;00:21:20,709;Aegon Targaryen got
365;00:21:18,170;00:21:20,709;quite a long way on fear.
366;00:21:20,710;00:21:22,379;He did.
367;00:21:22,380;00:21:24,999;But you once spoke to me
367;00:21:22,380;00:21:24,999;of breaking the wheel.
368;00:21:25,000;00:21:26,459;Aegon built a wheel.
369;00:21:26,460;00:21:28,669;If that's the kind of queen
369;00:21:26,460;00:21:28,669;you want to be,
370;00:21:28,670;00:21:31,249;how are you different
370;00:21:28,670;00:21:31,249;from all the other tyrants
370;00:21:28,670;00:21:31,249;that came before you?
371;00:21:31,250;00:21:34,669;So we walk into the lions' den.
372;00:21:34,670;00:21:36,339;My brother promised me
372;00:21:34,670;00:21:36,339;he'd keep a grip
373;00:21:36,340;00:21:37,959;on the Lannister forces.
374;00:21:37,960;00:21:41,839;Forgive me,
374;00:21:37,960;00:21:41,839;but I don't care about
374;00:21:37,960;00:21:41,839;any Lannister promises.
375;00:21:41,840;00:21:43,129;Except yours.
376;00:21:43,130;00:21:45,249;And I promised him
377;00:21:45,250;00:21:47,790;I'd keep you from doing
377;00:21:45,250;00:21:47,790;anything impulsive.
378;00:21:49,210;00:21:50,590;Impulsive?
379;00:21:54,130;00:21:56,839;This will be
379;00:21:54,130;00:21:56,839;a difficult negotiation.
380;00:21:56,840;00:22:00,379;We're sitting down
380;00:21:56,840;00:22:00,379;with people who want
380;00:21:56,840;00:22:00,379;to see us both headless.
381;00:22:00,380;00:22:02,879;My sister is likely
381;00:22:00,380;00:22:02,879;to say something
381;00:22:00,380;00:22:02,879;provocative.
382;00:22:02,880;00:22:05,419;And?
382;00:22:02,880;00:22:05,419;And you have been known
383;00:22:05,420;00:22:07,589;to lose your temper
383;00:22:05,420;00:22:07,589;from time to time,
384;00:22:07,590;00:22:08,919;as all great leaders do.
385;00:22:08,920;00:22:11,339;When have I lost my temper?
386;00:22:11,340;00:22:13,879;Burning the Tarlys,
386;00:22:11,340;00:22:13,879;for instance.
387;00:22:13,880;00:22:15,419;That was not impulsive.
388;00:22:15,420;00:22:18,249;That was necessary.
389;00:22:18,250;00:22:20,169;Perhaps.
389;00:22:18,250;00:22:20,169;Perhaps?
390;00:22:20,170;00:22:23,749;Perhaps the father
390;00:22:20,170;00:22:23,749;needed to die and not the son.
391;00:22:23,750;00:22:26,459;Perhaps they both needed time
391;00:22:23,750;00:22:26,459;to contemplate their mistakes
392;00:22:26,460;00:22:28,749;in the solitude of a cold cell.
393;00:22:28,750;00:22:31,169;We had no time to discuss
393;00:22:28,750;00:22:31,169;the possibilities
394;00:22:31,170;00:22:33,209;before you ended
394;00:22:31,170;00:22:33,209;their possibilities.
395;00:22:33,210;00:22:34,919;One could be forgiven
395;00:22:33,210;00:22:34,919;for thinking you're taking
396;00:22:34,920;00:22:36,749;your family's side
396;00:22:34,920;00:22:36,749;in this debate.
397;00:22:36,750;00:22:38,589;I am taking their side.
398;00:22:38,590;00:22:40,290;You need to take
398;00:22:38,590;00:22:40,290;your enemy's side
399;00:22:40,300;00:22:42,299;if you're going to see
399;00:22:40,300;00:22:42,299;things the way they do.
400;00:22:42,300;00:22:44,255;And you need to see things
400;00:22:42,300;00:22:44,255;the way they do
401;00:22:44,256;00:22:46,290;if you're going to
401;00:22:44,256;00:22:46,290;anticipate their actions,
402;00:22:46,300;00:22:49,629;respond effectively,
402;00:22:46,300;00:22:49,629;and beat them.
403;00:22:49,630;00:22:51,959;Which I want you
403;00:22:49,630;00:22:51,959;to do very much.
404;00:22:51,960;00:22:55,459;Because I believe in you
404;00:22:51,960;00:22:55,459;and in the world you want
404;00:22:51,960;00:22:55,459;to build.
405;00:22:55,460;00:22:58,129;But the world you want to build
406;00:22:58,130;00:22:59,709;doesn't get built all at once.
407;00:22:59,710;00:23:02,839;Probably not
407;00:22:59,710;00:23:02,839;in a single lifetime.
408;00:23:02,840;00:23:05,669;How do we ensure
408;00:23:02,840;00:23:05,669;that your vision endures?
409;00:23:05,670;00:23:08,630;After you break the wheel,
409;00:23:05,670;00:23:08,630;how do we make sure
409;00:23:05,670;00:23:08,630;it stays broken?
410;00:23:11,170;00:23:14,499;You want to know who sits
410;00:23:11,170;00:23:14,499;on the Iron Throne
410;00:23:11,170;00:23:14,499;after I'm dead.
411;00:23:14,500;00:23:15,540;Is that it?
412;00:23:17,340;00:23:19,249;You say you can't have children,
413;00:23:19,250;00:23:22,540;but there are other ways
413;00:23:19,250;00:23:22,540;of choosing a successor.
414;00:23:22,550;00:23:24,675;The Night's Watch
414;00:23:22,550;00:23:24,675;has one method.
415;00:23:24,676;00:23:27,040;The ironborn,
415;00:23:24,676;00:23:27,040;for all their many flaws,
415;00:23:24,676;00:23:27,040;have another.
416;00:23:27,050;00:23:29,755;We will discuss the succession
416;00:23:27,050;00:23:29,755;after I wear the crown.
417;00:23:29,756;00:23:31,499;Your Grace, I saw
417;00:23:29,756;00:23:31,499;hundreds of arrows
418;00:23:31,500;00:23:33,839;fly towards you
418;00:23:31,500;00:23:33,839;when you fought on
418;00:23:31,500;00:23:33,839;the Blackwater Rush,
419;00:23:33,840;00:23:35,919;and I saw hundreds
419;00:23:33,840;00:23:35,919;of arrows miss.
420;00:23:35,920;00:23:38,540;But any one of them
420;00:23:35,920;00:23:38,540;could have found your heart
420;00:23:35,920;00:23:38,540;and ended your--
421;00:23:38,550;00:23:41,715;You've been thinking about
421;00:23:38,550;00:23:41,715;my death quite a bit,
421;00:23:38,550;00:23:41,715;haven't you?
422;00:23:41,716;00:23:43,290;Is this one of the items
422;00:23:41,716;00:23:43,290;you discussed
423;00:23:43,300;00:23:45,005;with your brother
423;00:23:43,300;00:23:45,005;in King's Landing?
424;00:23:45,006;00:23:47,459;I'm trying to serve you
424;00:23:45,006;00:23:47,459;by planning for the long term.
425;00:23:47,460;00:23:49,040;Perhaps if you planned
425;00:23:47,460;00:23:49,040;for the short term,
426;00:23:49,050;00:23:51,100;we wouldn't have lost
426;00:23:49,050;00:23:51,100;Dorne and Highgarden.
427;00:23:54,170;00:23:58,380;We will discuss the succession
427;00:23:54,170;00:23:58,380;after I wear the crown.

431;00:24:47,000;00:24:48,290;A bear.

433;00:24:58,920;00:25:01,250;Do bears have blue eyes?

451;00:27:30,550;00:27:31,760;Go on.

455;00:27:49,630;00:27:53,379;I just got bit by a dead bear.
456;00:27:53,380;00:27:56,130;Aye, you did.
457;00:27:58,000;00:27:59,920;Funny old life.
458;00:28:01,840;00:28:03,669;Right, then.
459;00:28:03,670;00:28:05,590;We're off.
460;00:28:31,500;00:28:34,709;Where did she get it?

461;00:28:34,710;00:28:36,840;She seems very resourceful.
462;00:28:39,420;00:28:40,919;You're worried.
463;00:28:40,920;00:28:42,589;We're asking 20,000 men

466;00:28:49,340;00:28:52,129;a good reason to go home.
467;00:28:52,130;00:28:55,629;You question their loyalty?
467;00:28:52,130;00:28:55,629;Their loyalty is to Jon.
468;00:28:55,630;00:28:58,249;Jon is not here.
468;00:28:55,630;00:28:58,249;I haven't heard
468;00:28:55,630;00:28:58,249;from him in weeks.
469;00:28:58,250;00:29:00,290;You're the Lady of Winterfell.
470;00:29:00,300;00:29:03,010;The king chose you
470;00:29:00,300;00:29:03,010;to rule in his absence.
471;00:29:04,840;00:29:06,790;And rule you have.
472;00:29:06,800;00:29:10,129;Wisely, ably.
473;00:29:10,130;00:29:12,879;They see that.
473;00:29:10,130;00:29:12,879;They respect you.
474;00:29:12,880;00:29:14,290;Some may even prefer you.
475;00:29:14,300;00:29:15,720;Yes, they turned
475;00:29:14,300;00:29:15,720;their backs on Jon
476;00:29:15,710;00:29:17,129;when it was time
476;00:29:15,710;00:29:17,129;to retake Winterfell,
477;00:29:17,130;00:29:18,790;then they named him their king,
478;00:29:18,800;00:29:20,680;and now they're ready
478;00:29:18,800;00:29:20,680;to turn their backs
478;00:29:18,800;00:29:20,680;on him again.
479;00:29:20,681;00:29:22,919;How far would you trust
479;00:29:20,681;00:29:22,919;men like that?
480;00:29:22,920;00:29:24,999;They're all bloody wind vanes.
481;00:29:25,000;00:29:27,040;If they found out
481;00:29:25,000;00:29:27,040;that I wrote that letter,
482;00:29:27,050;00:29:28,549;a woman who's already married
483;00:29:28,550;00:29:32,089;not one,
483;00:29:28,550;00:29:32,089;but two enemies
483;00:29:28,550;00:29:32,089;of her house...
484;00:29:32,090;00:29:35,129;By the time Jon comes back,
484;00:29:32,090;00:29:35,129;he'll have no army left.
485;00:29:35,130;00:29:36,920;Arya's not like them.
486;00:29:39,340;00:29:40,749;She's your sister.
487;00:29:40,750;00:29:42,540;You may have disagreements,
488;00:29:42,550;00:29:45,005;but she would never
488;00:29:42,550;00:29:45,005;betray her family.
489;00:29:45,006;00:29:47,540;She would if she thought
489;00:29:45,006;00:29:47,540;I was going to betray Jon.
490;00:29:47,550;00:29:49,459;Is that what she thinks?
491;00:29:49,460;00:29:51,379;I don't know what she thinks.
492;00:29:51,380;00:29:53,420;I don't know her anymore.
