2;00:03:00,957;00:03:03,374;Easy, easy.
3;00:03:03,459;00:03:05,009;Easy.
4;00:03:11,550;00:03:13,017;What do you remember?
5;00:03:20,026;00:03:22,192;They stabbed me.
6;00:03:26,475;00:03:28,482;Olly...
7;00:03:30,286;00:03:32,736;he put a knife in my heart.
8;00:03:38,577;00:03:40,961;I shouldn't be here.
9;00:03:42,798;00:03:45,249;The lady brought you back.
10;00:03:45,334;00:03:49,086;Afterwards, after they stabbed you,
11;00:03:49,171;00:03:51,338;after you died, where did you go?
12;00:03:51,474;00:03:53,390;What did you see?
13;00:03:57,847;00:03:59,647;Nothing.
14;00:04:02,568;00:04:04,401;There was nothing at all.
15;00:04:08,691;00:04:11,492;The Lord let you
15;00:04:08,691;00:04:11,492;come back for a reason.
16;00:04:13,446;00:04:16,080;Stannis was not the prince
16;00:04:13,446;00:04:16,080;who was promised,
17;00:04:16,198;00:04:17,781;but someone has to be.
18;00:04:22,371;00:04:24,505;Could you give us a moment?
19;00:04:45,061;00:04:47,611;You were dead.
20;00:04:47,730;00:04:49,396;And now you're not.
21;00:04:50,900;00:04:54,735;That's completely
21;00:04:50,900;00:04:54,735;fucking mad, seems to me.
22;00:04:54,870;00:04:57,287;I can only imagine
22;00:04:54,870;00:04:57,287;how it seems to you.
23;00:04:59,625;00:05:01,959;I did what I thought was right.
24;00:05:04,380;00:05:06,080;And I got murdered for it.
25;00:05:06,215;00:05:09,416;And now I'm back.
26;00:05:09,552;00:05:10,918;Why?
27;00:05:11,053;00:05:12,636;I don't know.
28;00:05:12,755;00:05:15,139;Maybe we'll never know.
29;00:05:15,257;00:05:17,224;What does it matter?
30;00:05:19,428;00:05:20,978;You go on.
31;00:05:22,765;00:05:25,265;You fight for as long as you can.
32;00:05:25,401;00:05:28,268;You clean up as much
32;00:05:25,401;00:05:28,268;of the shit as you can.
33;00:05:29,488;00:05:31,321;I don't know how to do that.
34;00:05:33,159;00:05:35,075;I thought I did, but...
35;00:05:38,998;00:05:40,864;I failed.
36;00:05:43,619;00:05:45,919;Good.
37;00:05:46,005;00:05:47,504;Now go fail again.
38;00:06:44,013;00:06:46,263;They think you're some kind of god.
39;00:06:46,348;00:06:49,183;The man who returned from the dead.
40;00:06:49,268;00:06:50,851;I'm not a god.
41;00:06:50,936;00:06:53,654;I know that.
42;00:06:55,191;00:06:57,157;I saw your pecker.
43;00:06:57,243;00:07:00,160;What kind of god would
43;00:06:57,243;00:07:00,160;have a pecker that small?
44;00:07:25,888;00:07:28,472;Your eyes are still brown.
45;00:07:28,557;00:07:30,357;Is that still you in there?
46;00:07:30,442;00:07:32,359;I think so.
47;00:07:34,897;00:07:37,564;Hold off on burning my body for now.
48;00:07:39,902;00:07:42,069;That's funny.
49;00:07:44,073;00:07:45,956;You sure that's still you in there?
50;00:08:17,439;00:08:19,406;You all right?
51;00:08:19,491;00:08:22,109;Yes.
51;00:08:19,491;00:08:22,109;Yes, I'm fine.
52;00:08:25,164;00:08:28,916;Did I ever tell you I used to
52;00:08:25,164;00:08:28,916;think the sea was called the see
53;00:08:29,001;00:08:31,952;because it was nothing but water
53;00:08:29,001;00:08:31,952;as far as the eye could see?
54;00:08:32,037;00:08:33,337;I don't think so.
55;00:08:33,455;00:08:35,839;Sea, see.
56;00:08:35,958;00:08:38,759;They're spelled different,
56;00:08:35,958;00:08:38,759;but they sound the same.
57;00:08:40,129;00:08:41,845;Yeah, they do.
58;00:08:41,964;00:08:44,932;It was before I learned
58;00:08:41,964;00:08:44,932;how to read, obviously.
59;00:08:48,137;00:08:51,188;Sam, are you going to be sick?
60;00:09:05,955;00:09:08,655;Won't be long.
60;00:09:05,955;00:09:08,655;We'll be in the south soon.
61;00:09:08,791;00:09:10,824;I'm excited to see Oldtown.
62;00:09:10,909;00:09:16,413;Captain says it's the most
62;00:09:10,909;00:09:16,413;beautiful city in Westeros.
63;00:09:18,417;00:09:19,916;Are you going to vomit again?
64;00:09:20,002;00:09:22,219;No.
64;00:09:20,002;00:09:22,219;No, no, no.
65;00:09:24,423;00:09:26,506;The Citadel doesn't admit women.
66;00:09:26,642;00:09:29,676;There won't be a place for
66;00:09:26,642;00:09:29,676;you there or for Little Sam.
67;00:09:29,812;00:09:33,230;I stayed at Castle Black.
67;00:09:29,812;00:09:33,230;There's no women allowed there.
68;00:09:33,349;00:09:35,399;The Citadel isn't Castle Black.
69;00:09:35,517;00:09:38,902;I don't have a Jon Snow
69;00:09:35,517;00:09:38,902;or Maester Aemon
70;00:09:39,021;00:09:41,822;to help me bend the rules.
71;00:09:41,907;00:09:43,740;I'll stay in Oldtown, then.
72;00:09:43,859;00:09:45,525;By yourself?
73;00:09:45,611;00:09:47,327;With a baby and no money?
74;00:09:48,580;00:09:50,697;So if we're not going to Oldtown,
75;00:09:50,783;00:09:51,948;where are you taking me?
76;00:09:53,369;00:09:55,702;To my home.
77;00:09:55,788;00:09:57,037;Horn Hill.
78;00:09:59,208;00:10:01,625;My father's--
78;00:09:59,208;00:10:01,625;well, my father,
79;00:10:01,710;00:10:05,295;but my mother's a kind woman
79;00:10:01,710;00:10:05,295;and my sister's lovely.
80;00:10:05,381;00:10:08,098;They'll take care of you both.
81;00:10:09,385;00:10:11,468;Wherever you go,
81;00:10:09,385;00:10:11,468;I go, too.
82;00:10:11,553;00:10:13,303;That's what you said.
83;00:10:29,705;00:10:32,956;I said that because I want
83;00:10:29,705;00:10:32,956;you and Little Sam to be safe.
84;00:10:33,075;00:10:35,325;That's all I want--
85;00:10:35,411;00:10:38,962;to become a maester so I can
85;00:10:35,411;00:10:38,962;help Jon when the time comes
86;00:10:39,081;00:10:40,714;so you'll be safe.
87;00:10:40,799;00:10:42,416;Us and everyone else in the world.
88;00:10:42,501;00:10:44,634;I don't care about them.
89;00:10:44,753;00:10:48,638;Well, no, I do, but I don't really.
90;00:10:49,842;00:10:52,142;I care about you and him.
91;00:10:54,430;00:10:56,596;I know that, Sam.
92;00:10:56,732;00:10:58,932;And he does, too.
93;00:11:02,154;00:11:04,237;You're the only one who ever has.
94;00:11:12,831;00:11:15,449;If you think it's for the best,
95;00:11:15,534;00:11:18,168;we trust you.
96;00:11:18,287;00:11:21,171;I'd feel better if you threw
96;00:11:18,287;00:11:21,171;something at me and stormed off.
97;00:11:21,290;00:11:24,758;I'd never do that
97;00:11:21,290;00:11:24,758;to the father of my son.
98;00:12:22,351;00:12:24,851;That's my father.
99;00:12:24,937;00:12:27,354;The man beside him is Howland Reed,
100;00:12:27,439;00:12:28,989;Meera's father.
101;00:12:40,669;00:12:42,536;Ser Arthur Dayne.
102;00:12:42,621;00:12:44,754;The Sword of the Morning.
103;00:12:44,873;00:12:47,624;Father said he was the best
103;00:12:44,873;00:12:47,624;swordsman he ever saw.
104;00:13:02,024;00:13:03,773;Lord Stark.
105;00:13:03,892;00:13:07,060;I looked for you on the Trident.
106;00:13:07,196;00:13:09,145;We weren't there.
107;00:13:09,231;00:13:10,814;Your friend the usurper
108;00:13:10,899;00:13:13,900;would lie beneath the
108;00:13:10,899;00:13:13,900;ground if we had been.
109;00:13:13,986;00:13:16,036;The Mad King is dead.
110;00:13:16,121;00:13:18,205;Rhaegar lies beneath the ground.
111;00:13:18,290;00:13:20,707;Why weren't you there
111;00:13:18,290;00:13:20,707;to protect your prince?
112;00:13:20,792;00:13:22,709;Our prince wanted us here.
113;00:13:30,385;00:13:32,085;Where's my sister?
114;00:13:34,590;00:13:37,390;I wish you good fortune
114;00:13:34,590;00:13:37,390;in the wars to come.
115;00:13:44,349;00:13:46,850;And now it begins.
116;00:13:51,406;00:13:53,440;No.
117;00:13:53,575;00:13:55,492;Now it ends.
118;00:15:32,707;00:15:34,708;He's better than my father.
119;00:15:34,793;00:15:36,343;Far better.
120;00:15:41,433;00:15:43,383;But Father beat him.
121;00:15:43,518;00:15:45,552;Did he?
122;00:15:45,687;00:15:47,637;I know he did.
123;00:15:47,723;00:15:49,389;Heard the story a thousand times.
124;00:16:07,492;00:16:09,325;He stabbed him in the back.
125;00:16:27,596;00:16:30,096;What's in the tower?
126;00:16:30,182;00:16:31,898;That's enough for one day.
127;00:16:31,983;00:16:33,683;We'll visit again another time.
128;00:16:33,769;00:16:36,352;I want to see where he's going.
128;00:16:33,769;00:16:36,352;Time to go.
129;00:16:37,939;00:16:39,105;Father!
130;00:17:05,550;00:17:07,217;Why did you do that?
131;00:17:07,302;00:17:09,385;Take me back there.
131;00:17:07,302;00:17:09,385;I want to go back.
132;00:17:09,471;00:17:10,770;No.
133;00:17:12,974;00:17:15,358;He heard me.
133;00:17:12,974;00:17:15,358;Maybe.
134;00:17:15,477;00:17:18,778;Maybe he heard the wind.
134;00:17:15,477;00:17:18,778;He heard me.
135;00:17:18,864;00:17:21,865;The past is already written.
135;00:17:18,864;00:17:21,865;The ink is dry.
136;00:17:21,983;00:17:24,284;What's in that tower?
137;00:17:24,369;00:17:25,702;I want to go back there.
138;00:17:25,821;00:17:28,571;I've told you many times,
138;00:17:25,821;00:17:28,571;stay too long
139;00:17:28,657;00:17:31,124;where you don't belong
139;00:17:28,657;00:17:31,124;and you will never return.
140;00:17:31,209;00:17:32,992;Why do I want to return?
141;00:17:33,128;00:17:34,878;So I can be a cripple again?
142;00:17:34,996;00:17:37,413;So I can talk
142;00:17:34,996;00:17:37,413;to an old man in a tree?
143;00:17:37,499;00:17:39,549;You think I wanted to sit
143;00:17:37,499;00:17:39,549;here for 1,000 years
144;00:17:39,668;00:17:41,501;watching the world from a distance
145;00:17:41,636;00:17:43,002;as the roots grew through me?
146;00:17:43,138;00:17:44,804;So why did you?
147;00:17:45,974;00:17:47,674;I was waiting for you.
148;00:17:47,809;00:17:49,559;I don't want to be you.
149;00:17:49,678;00:17:52,312;I don't blame you.
150;00:17:53,648;00:17:55,849;You won't be here forever.
151;00:17:55,984;00:17:58,568;You won't be an old man in a tree.
152;00:17:58,687;00:18:01,104;But before you leave,
153;00:18:01,189;00:18:04,190;you must learn.
154;00:18:04,276;00:18:06,109;Learn what?
155;00:18:06,194;00:18:08,828;Everything.

189;00:22:02,313;00:22:05,314;it in all that leather.
190;00:22:12,490;00:22:14,407;If we could have the room.
191;00:22:24,836;00:22:27,537;You look lovely today, my dear.
191;00:22:24,836;00:22:27,537;You really do.
192;00:22:27,622;00:22:32,008;How you climbed all those steps
192;00:22:27,622;00:22:32,008;without breaking a sweat.
193;00:22:32,127;00:22:33,327;If you're going to torture me,
194;00:22:33,378;00:22:35,461;just call them back
194;00:22:33,378;00:22:35,461;and get on with it.
195;00:22:35,597;00:22:37,630;I am not a torturer.
196;00:22:39,100;00:22:42,518;Though it so often is
196;00:22:39,100;00:22:42,518;what people deserve.
197;00:22:43,721;00:22:46,472;And it does provide answers.
198;00:22:46,558;00:22:49,442;But they're usually
198;00:22:46,558;00:22:49,442;the wrong answers.
199;00:22:49,527;00:22:53,029;My job is to find the right answers.
200;00:22:53,148;00:22:55,231;Do you know how I do that?
201;00:22:55,316;00:22:58,618;I do it by making people happy.
202;00:22:58,703;00:23:01,320;I'd like to make you happy, Vala.
203;00:23:01,456;00:23:04,657;That's your name, isn't it, Vala?
204;00:23:04,742;00:23:07,043;That's all right.
205;00:23:07,162;00:23:10,296;I know who you are
205;00:23:07,162;00:23:10,296;and what you've done.
206;00:23:12,167;00:23:13,466;You've done a lot.
207;00:23:13,551;00:23:16,002;You've sacrificed
207;00:23:13,551;00:23:16,002;your body for a cause,
208;00:23:16,137;00:23:19,472;which is more than most people do.
209;00:23:19,557;00:23:22,675;And you've helped
209;00:23:19,557;00:23:22,675;the Sons of the Harpy
210;00:23:22,760;00:23:25,511;murder the Unsullied
210;00:23:22,760;00:23:25,511;and the Second Sons.
211;00:23:25,647;00:23:28,981;The Unsullied and the Second
211;00:23:25,647;00:23:28,981;Sons are foreign soldiers
212;00:23:29,067;00:23:31,100;brought here by a foreign queen
213;00:23:31,186;00:23:33,903;to destroy our city and our history.
214;00:23:34,022;00:23:36,856;I understand.
215;00:23:36,941;00:23:39,609;Well, that makes perfect sense
216;00:23:39,694;00:23:42,445;from your perspective.
217;00:23:42,530;00:23:46,332;I have a different
217;00:23:42,530;00:23:46,332;perspective, of course.
218;00:23:46,417;00:23:49,869;I think it's important that you try
218;00:23:46,417;00:23:49,869;to see things from my perspective
219;00:23:50,004;00:23:52,371;just as I will try
219;00:23:50,004;00:23:52,371;to see them from yours.
220;00:23:52,457;00:23:54,674;Because that is the only way
221;00:23:54,759;00:23:57,677;that I can make you and Dom happy.
222;00:24:00,765;00:24:04,550;That is how
222;00:24:00,765;00:24:04,550;you pronounce it-- Dom?
223;00:24:04,686;00:24:07,687;I'm afraid I don't really
223;00:24:04,686;00:24:07,687;speak the language.
224;00:24:09,224;00:24:11,107;Such a handsome boy.
225;00:24:11,226;00:24:14,727;Those big, brown eyes. Good
225;00:24:11,226;00:24:14,727;luck keeping the ladies away.
226;00:24:14,863;00:24:18,981;Yes, you're a true
226;00:24:14,863;00:24:18,981;liberator, aren't you?
227;00:24:19,067;00:24:21,951;You won't torture me,
227;00:24:19,067;00:24:21,951;you'll just threaten my son.
228;00:24:22,070;00:24:24,487;Children are blameless.
229;00:24:25,540;00:24:27,740;I have never hurt them.
230;00:24:27,825;00:24:30,159;Your boy is in no immediate danger,
231;00:24:30,245;00:24:31,827;this I swear to you.
232;00:24:33,798;00:24:35,715;But between us, dear,
233;00:24:35,800;00:24:38,918;you did conspire to kill
233;00:24:35,800;00:24:38,918;the queen's soldiers.
234;00:24:39,053;00:24:41,587;We both know the penalty
234;00:24:39,053;00:24:41,587;for that crime.
235;00:24:46,728;00:24:50,396;How will poor Dom
235;00:24:46,728;00:24:50,396;get on without his mother?
236;00:24:50,481;00:24:52,515;And with his breathing problem.
237;00:24:52,600;00:24:54,934;If I tell you anything,
237;00:24:52,600;00:24:54,934;they'll kill me.
238;00:24:55,069;00:24:57,236;So either you kill me or they do.
239;00:24:57,322;00:25:00,856;Yes, from your perspective,
239;00:24:57,322;00:25:00,856;this is a problem.
240;00:25:02,410;00:25:04,443;There is a third option, though.
241;00:25:04,529;00:25:07,747;A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.
242;00:25:07,832;00:25:12,451;I've already booked passage for
242;00:25:07,832;00:25:12,451;a woman and her young son.
243;00:25:12,587;00:25:16,005;I'll even throw in a bag of
243;00:25:12,587;00:25:16,005;silver to help you start again.
244;00:25:16,124;00:25:17,873;Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask
245;00:25:17,959;00:25:21,677;one of our leather-clad
245;00:25:17,959;00:25:21,677;friends back in to carry it.
246;00:25:21,796;00:25:23,462;Far too heavy for me.
247;00:25:24,849;00:25:26,716;The boat sails at dawn.
248;00:25:26,801;00:25:29,602;You need to decide now.
249;00:25:29,687;00:25:32,471;A new life for you and Dom
250;00:25:32,557;00:25:34,190;or...
251;00:25:50,241;00:25:52,041;What should we do while we wait?
252;00:25:52,160;00:25:53,960;To pass the time, what should we do?
253;00:25:54,045;00:25:56,379;What should we talk about?
254;00:25:58,716;00:26:00,499;You speak 19 languages.
255;00:26:00,585;00:26:03,919;You must occasionally use some
255;00:26:00,585;00:26:03,919;of them to talk about things.
256;00:26:04,005;00:26:07,256;You two, you spend a great
256;00:26:04,005;00:26:07,256;deal of time together.
257;00:26:07,342;00:26:10,509;What would you be talking
257;00:26:07,342;00:26:10,509;about if I weren't here?
258;00:26:11,596;00:26:13,562;Patrol.
259;00:26:13,681;00:26:16,315;When I am going on patrol
259;00:26:13,681;00:26:16,315;with the Unsullied.
260;00:26:16,401;00:26:18,985;What we see on patrol.
261;00:26:19,070;00:26:21,020;Who we captured on patrol.
262;00:26:21,105;00:26:23,572;That's good.
262;00:26:21,105;00:26:23,572;That's very good.
263;00:26:25,693;00:26:28,077;But that's a report.
264;00:26:28,196;00:26:30,363;I was thinking more
264;00:26:28,196;00:26:30,363;of a conversation.
265;00:26:30,498;00:26:33,532;A wise man once said the
265;00:26:30,498;00:26:33,532;true history of the world
266;00:26:33,618;00:26:37,036;is the history of great
266;00:26:33,618;00:26:37,036;conversations in elegant rooms.
267;00:26:37,121;00:26:39,038;Who said this?
268;00:26:39,123;00:26:41,507;Me.
269;00:26:41,592;00:26:43,542;Just now.
270;00:26:49,884;00:26:52,134;All right, no conversations.
271;00:26:52,220;00:26:54,103;Let's play a game.
272;00:26:56,974;00:26:58,774;You don't play games,
272;00:26:56,974;00:26:58,774;either one of you, ever?
273;00:26:58,860;00:27:00,059;Games are for children.
274;00:27:00,194;00:27:01,811;My master Kraznys
275;00:27:01,896;00:27:04,063;would sometimes make us play games.
276;00:27:04,198;00:27:05,898;There, that's a start.
277;00:27:06,034;00:27:09,702;Only the girls.
277;00:27:06,034;00:27:09,702;No, no, no.
278;00:27:09,787;00:27:11,737;Not that.
278;00:27:09,787;00:27:11,737;Of course not that.
279;00:27:13,124;00:27:15,374;Innocent games.
279;00:27:13,124;00:27:15,374;Fun games.
280;00:27:15,460;00:27:16,959;Drinking games.
281;00:27:17,078;00:27:19,245;We do not drink.
282;00:27:19,380;00:27:21,380;Until you do.
283;00:27:23,084;00:27:25,251;All right.
283;00:27:23,084;00:27:25,251;No drinking.
284;00:27:25,336;00:27:26,886;We can play without drinking.
285;00:27:26,971;00:27:29,138;It's a wonderful game.
285;00:27:26,971;00:27:29,138;I invented it.
286;00:27:29,257;00:27:30,756;Here's how it works.
287;00:27:30,842;00:27:32,808;I make a statement about your past.
288;00:27:32,927;00:27:34,560;If I'm wrong, I drink.
289;00:27:34,645;00:27:37,763;And if I'm right--
290;00:27:37,849;00:27:41,267;maybe we can't play without drinking.
291;00:27:43,020;00:27:45,488;Oh, you took your time.
292;00:27:45,606;00:27:47,573;Sorry.
293;00:27:47,658;00:27:51,277;I was busy learning who funds
293;00:27:47,658;00:27:51,277;the Sons of the Harpy.
294;00:27:51,412;00:27:53,446;Some things you can't rush.
294;00:27:51,412;00:27:53,446;You found out?
295;00:27:53,531;00:27:55,664;The Good Masters of Astapor
296;00:27:55,783;00:27:57,950;and the Wise Masters of Yunkai.
297;00:27:58,035;00:28:01,036;With help from their
297;00:27:58,035;00:28:01,036;friends in Volantis.
298;00:28:01,122;00:28:02,588;You see?
299;00:28:02,673;00:28:05,174;You don't even have to worry
299;00:28:02,673;00:28:05,174;about the local rebellion.
300;00:28:05,293;00:28:06,792;We only have to worry about
301;00:28:06,928;00:28:09,128;the three rich foreign
301;00:28:06,928;00:28:09,128;cities paying for it.
302;00:28:09,213;00:28:10,846;We conquered Astapor and Yunkai once.
303;00:28:10,965;00:28:12,798;We will do it again
303;00:28:10,965;00:28:12,798;and execute the Masters.
304;00:28:12,884;00:28:16,302;If the Unsullied march off to
304;00:28:12,884;00:28:16,302;reconquer Astapor and Yunkai,
305;00:28:16,387;00:28:17,887;who will remain to defend
305;00:28:16,387;00:28:17,887;the free people of Meereen?
306;00:28:17,972;00:28:20,523;If we do not fight them,
306;00:28:17,972;00:28:20,523;how can we stop them?
307;00:28:20,641;00:28:22,308;We cannot.
308;00:28:22,443;00:28:25,194;The Masters speak only one language.
309;00:28:25,313;00:28:26,979;They spoke it to me for many years.
310;00:28:27,064;00:28:28,814;I know it better
310;00:28:27,064;00:28:28,814;than my mother tongue.
311;00:28:28,950;00:28:32,618;If we want them to hear us, we
311;00:28:28,950;00:28:32,618;must speak it back to them.
312;00:28:32,703;00:28:34,870;May it be the last
312;00:28:32,703;00:28:34,870;thing they ever hear.
313;00:28:34,989;00:28:37,039;You may be right.
314;00:28:37,158;00:28:39,125;So we will fight them?
315;00:28:39,210;00:28:41,160;Possibly.
315;00:28:39,210;00:28:41,160;Possibly?
316;00:28:41,245;00:28:44,163;It's a conversation.
317;00:28:44,248;00:28:46,549;Tell me, can your little
317;00:28:44,248;00:28:46,549;birds get a message
318;00:28:46,667;00:28:49,885;to the Good Masters of Astapor,
318;00:28:46,667;00:28:49,885;the Wise Masters of Yunkai,
319;00:28:50,004;00:28:52,555;and benevolent enslavers of Volantis?
320;00:28:52,673;00:28:55,307;Of course.
320;00:28:52,673;00:28:55,307;Men can be fickle,
321;00:28:55,393;00:28:58,511;but birds I always trust.
322;00:29:04,852;00:29:07,736;Your eye looks much better, Arthur.
323;00:29:07,855;00:29:09,188;How's your mother's jaw?
324;00:29:09,273;00:29:10,823;Better.
325;00:29:10,908;00:29:12,241;And your father?
326;00:29:12,360;00:29:14,827;No one's seen him.
327;00:29:14,912;00:29:16,195;And no one will.
328;00:29:16,280;00:29:17,913;That worked out rather nicely.
329;00:29:18,032;00:29:20,032;Will Lord Varys ever come back?
330;00:29:20,168;00:29:22,201;I don't think so.
331;00:29:22,336;00:29:24,119;Do you miss him?
332;00:29:24,205;00:29:26,789;He was nice.
333;00:29:26,874;00:29:29,208;He called us his little birds.
334;00:29:29,293;00:29:30,876;He gave us sweets.
335;00:29:33,130;00:29:35,848;It's funny you should mention that.
336;00:29:37,602;00:29:41,554;Guess what I happened to find today.
337;00:29:41,639;00:29:45,224;Candied plums from Dorne.
338;00:29:48,779;00:29:50,896;Now remember, if any of your friends
339;00:29:51,032;00:29:54,233;like sweets or need help,
339;00:29:51,032;00:29:54,233;they can always come to me.
340;00:29:54,368;00:29:58,737;All I need in return are whispers.
341;00:30:06,214;00:30:07,997;No need to be afraid.
342;00:30:08,082;00:30:09,999;This is Ser Gregor.
343;00:30:10,084;00:30:12,334;He's friends with all my friends.
344;00:30:18,175;00:30:19,892;Run along now.
345;00:30:24,849;00:30:26,565;Varys's little birds?
346;00:30:26,651;00:30:28,150;Your little birds now, Your Grace.
347;00:30:28,269;00:30:30,185;What did you do to him exactly?
348;00:30:30,271;00:30:31,937;I haven't been able
348;00:30:30,271;00:30:31,937;to get a clear answer.
349;00:30:32,073;00:30:34,106;Oh, a number of things.
350;00:30:34,191;00:30:35,691;Does he understand what we're saying?
351;00:30:35,776;00:30:38,027;I mean, to the extent
351;00:30:35,776;00:30:38,027;that he ever understood
352;00:30:38,112;00:30:40,362;complete sentences
352;00:30:38,112;00:30:40,362;in the first place.
353;00:30:42,116;00:30:44,250;He understands well enough.
354;00:30:44,335;00:30:46,368;So tell him to march into the sept
355;00:30:46,454;00:30:49,088;and crush the High Sparrow's
355;00:30:46,454;00:30:49,088;head like a melon.
356;00:30:49,173;00:30:52,591;The High Sparrow has hundreds of
356;00:30:49,173;00:30:52,591;Faith Militant surrounding him.
357;00:30:52,677;00:30:54,960;Ser Gregor can't face them all.
358;00:30:55,046;00:30:56,962;And he won't have to.
359;00:30:57,098;00:30:59,098;He'll only have to face one.
360;00:31:01,218;00:31:03,636;Has the Faith leveled
360;00:31:01,218;00:31:03,636;official charges yet?
361;00:31:03,721;00:31:05,387;Not yet.
362;00:31:05,473;00:31:08,641;That is one trial by combat
362;00:31:05,473;00:31:08,641;I look forward to watching.
363;00:31:08,776;00:31:10,643;Don't stop at the city.
364;00:31:10,778;00:31:13,062;I want little birds in Dorne,
365;00:31:13,147;00:31:15,814;in Highgarden, in the North.
366;00:31:15,950;00:31:18,984;If someone is planning on
366;00:31:15,950;00:31:18,984;making our losses their gains,
367;00:31:19,120;00:31:20,953;I want to hear it.
368;00:31:21,038;00:31:23,656;If someone is laughing at the queen
369;00:31:23,741;00:31:26,375;who walked naked through
369;00:31:23,741;00:31:26,375;the streets covered in shit,
370;00:31:26,494;00:31:28,243;I want to hear.
371;00:31:28,329;00:31:31,130;I want to know who they are.
372;00:31:31,215;00:31:33,332;I want to know where they are.
373;00:31:39,590;00:31:42,558;As bad as Lord
373;00:31:39,590;00:31:42,558;Varys was, Qyburn is worse.
374;00:31:42,677;00:31:45,060;I told them all.
374;00:31:42,677;00:31:45,060;I told them.
375;00:31:45,179;00:31:47,062;He's arrogant, dangerous.
376;00:31:47,181;00:31:50,182;You don't get thrown out of the
376;00:31:47,181;00:31:50,182;Citadel without good reason.
377;00:31:50,318;00:31:52,017;And no one listened to my advice.
378;00:31:52,153;00:31:54,236;So here we are.
379;00:31:54,355;00:31:56,655;And what he's done to Gregor Clegane
380;00:31:56,741;00:31:58,691;is an abomination.
381;00:31:58,776;00:32:01,860;We never sanctioned this experiment.
382;00:32:01,996;00:32:04,530;I for one think it will
382;00:32:01,996;00:32:04,530;be in our best interest
383;00:32:04,665;00:32:06,332;to have the beast dest--
384;00:32:11,205;00:32:13,706;Can I help you?
384;00:32:11,205;00:32:13,706;Why are you here?
385;00:32:13,841;00:32:16,208;My mother--
385;00:32:13,841;00:32:16,208;I was invited, my dear,
386;00:32:16,293;00:32:18,961;to help deal with several
386;00:32:16,293;00:32:18,961;troublesome issues,
387;00:32:19,046;00:32:21,380;such as the queen's imprisonment.
388;00:32:21,465;00:32:23,882;Thank you for bringing it up.
389;00:32:24,018;00:32:27,720;It's well past time we addressed
389;00:32:24,018;00:32:27,720;the abuses I endured.
390;00:32:27,805;00:32:30,022;Margaery is the queen.
391;00:32:30,107;00:32:31,890;You are not the queen
392;00:32:31,976;00:32:34,026;because you're not
392;00:32:31,976;00:32:34,026;married to the king.
393;00:32:34,111;00:32:35,811;I do appreciate these things
394;00:32:35,896;00:32:39,531;can get a bit confusing
394;00:32:35,896;00:32:39,531;in your family.
395;00:32:39,617;00:32:41,784;This is a small council meeting.
396;00:32:41,902;00:32:44,036;You have no position
396;00:32:41,902;00:32:44,036;on the small council.
397;00:32:44,121;00:32:45,904;I'm the Lord Commander
397;00:32:44,121;00:32:45,904;of the Kingsguard.
398;00:32:45,990;00:32:47,430;The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard
399;00:32:47,541;00:32:49,241;does have a position
399;00:32:47,541;00:32:49,241;on the small council.
400;00:32:49,377;00:32:51,910;Grand Maester Pycelle, would
400;00:32:49,377;00:32:51,910;you sanction that statement?
401;00:32:51,996;00:32:54,079;Well, um...
402;00:32:54,215;00:32:57,166;I would say Ser Gerold Hightower
403;00:32:57,251;00:32:59,334;had a seat on the Mad King's council.
404;00:32:59,420;00:33:02,004;Of course, that was the Mad King.
405;00:33:02,089;00:33:03,722;King Robert saw things differently.
406;00:33:03,808;00:33:05,507;And King--
407;00:33:08,813;00:33:11,647;What about Myrcella's death, Uncle?
408;00:33:11,766;00:33:13,932;Do you consider the
408;00:33:11,766;00:33:13,932;murder of your own blood
409;00:33:14,018;00:33:16,018;a troublesome issue?
410;00:33:16,103;00:33:17,936;The same women who murdered Myrcella
411;00:33:18,072;00:33:20,522;have overthrown House Martell
411;00:33:18,072;00:33:20,522;and taken control of Dorne.
412;00:33:20,608;00:33:22,324;We've got a lot to discuss.
413;00:33:22,443;00:33:24,827;All of us together.
414;00:33:24,945;00:33:28,614;And seeing as you cannot make us
414;00:33:24,945;00:33:28,614;leave, we best get on with it.
415;00:33:30,785;00:33:33,285;No, we cannot make you leave.
416;00:33:33,421;00:33:36,505;And you cannot make us stay.
417;00:33:36,624;00:33:40,209;Not unless you're gonna have
417;00:33:36,624;00:33:40,209;that thing murder us all.
418;00:34:21,585;00:34:23,418;Your Grace.
419;00:34:23,504;00:34:26,672;My mother would like to see her
419;00:34:23,504;00:34:26,672;daughter's final resting place.
420;00:34:26,807;00:34:29,341;I'm sorry, Your Grace.
421;00:34:29,477;00:34:31,343;That's not possible.
421;00:34:29,477;00:34:31,343;Not yet.
422;00:34:31,428;00:34:33,095;When will it be possible?
423;00:34:33,180;00:34:35,514;When she's fully atoned for her sins.
424;00:34:35,566;00:34:38,183;You cut off her hair
424;00:34:35,566;00:34:38,183;and marched her naked
425;00:34:38,269;00:34:40,686;through the streets
425;00:34:38,269;00:34:40,686;in front of the whole city.
426;00:34:40,821;00:34:42,488;That wasn't the full atonement?
427;00:34:42,573;00:34:44,356;No.
428;00:34:44,408;00:34:47,576;She must stand trial
428;00:34:44,408;00:34:47,576;before seven septons
429;00:34:47,695;00:34:49,828;so we can learn the true
429;00:34:47,695;00:34:49,828;extent of her sins.
430;00:34:49,914;00:34:54,082;I want you to let her see
430;00:34:49,914;00:34:54,082;Myrcella's resting place.
431;00:34:54,201;00:34:55,751;I am the king.
432;00:34:55,870;00:34:57,336;You are.
433;00:34:59,373;00:35:01,206;And what does that mean to you?
434;00:35:01,342;00:35:02,708;It means a great deal to me.
435;00:35:02,793;00:35:04,710;The Crown and the Faith
436;00:35:04,795;00:35:06,929;are the twin pillars of the world.
437;00:35:07,047;00:35:09,047;Do you know who told me that?
438;00:35:10,434;00:35:11,767;Your mother.
439;00:35:11,886;00:35:14,386;My mother who is unclean?
440;00:35:14,471;00:35:18,440;My mother who still needs to atone
440;00:35:14,471;00:35:18,440;after all you've put her through?
441;00:35:37,161;00:35:40,462;How do you think the Mother
441;00:35:37,161;00:35:40,462;Above first came to us?
442;00:35:41,465;00:35:43,248;How did men and women
443;00:35:43,384;00:35:46,835;first come to feel
443;00:35:43,384;00:35:46,835;the Mother's presence, hmm?
444;00:35:48,255;00:35:50,055;It was through their own mothers.
445;00:35:52,760;00:35:56,144;There's a great deal of falsehood
445;00:35:52,760;00:35:56,144;in Cersei. You know that.
446;00:35:56,263;00:36:00,432;But when she speaks of you, the
446;00:35:56,263;00:36:00,432;Mother's love outshines it all.
447;00:36:02,486;00:36:05,437;Her love for you is more real
448;00:36:05,522;00:36:07,439;than anything else in this world
449;00:36:07,524;00:36:10,525;because it doesn't
449;00:36:07,524;00:36:10,525;come from this world.
450;00:36:10,611;00:36:12,578;But you know that.
451;00:36:12,663;00:36:15,280;You've felt it.
452;00:36:15,366;00:36:17,583;You've seen her
452;00:36:15,366;00:36:17,583;when she talks to you.
453;00:36:19,670;00:36:21,453;Yes.
454;00:36:21,538;00:36:23,755;It's a great gift.
455;00:36:23,841;00:36:25,841;One I never had.
456;00:36:27,461;00:36:29,461;Envy.
457;00:36:29,597;00:36:32,014;One more thing for me to atone for.
458;00:36:33,467;00:36:35,350;Your Grace,
458;00:36:33,467;00:36:35,350;do you-- may I?
459;00:36:35,469;00:36:37,019;Do you mind?
460;00:36:37,137;00:36:38,470;It's my knees.
461;00:36:38,555;00:36:40,439;Of course.
462;00:36:45,779;00:36:49,648;When your mother
462;00:36:45,779;00:36:49,648;made her walk of atonement,
463;00:36:49,783;00:36:51,984;she did it to get back to you.
464;00:36:52,069;00:36:54,820;I still don't understand
464;00:36:52,069;00:36:54,820;why you want to put her
465;00:36:54,955;00:36:56,705;through any more than
465;00:36:54,955;00:36:56,705;she's already endured.
466;00:36:56,824;00:37:00,158;It's not what I want.
466;00:36:56,824;00:37:00,158;It's what the gods want.
467;00:37:00,294;00:37:02,878;They make their will known
467;00:37:00,294;00:37:02,878;to us and it's up to us
468;00:37:02,997;00:37:05,414;to either accept or reject it.
469;00:37:07,501;00:37:09,167;Please.
470;00:37:14,508;00:37:17,726;If we're to be just and good,
471;00:37:17,845;00:37:20,562;then we accept it,
471;00:37:17,845;00:37:20,562;all of us, even kings.
472;00:37:20,681;00:37:24,933;A true leader avails himself
472;00:37:20,681;00:37:24,933;of the wisest counsel he can.
473;00:37:25,019;00:37:27,486;And no one is wiser than the gods.
474;00:37:30,024;00:37:33,191;My grandfather once said
474;00:37:30,024;00:37:33,191;something similar.
475;00:37:33,327;00:37:35,160;Except for the part about the gods.
476;00:37:35,245;00:37:39,164;The gods worked through him
476;00:37:35,245;00:37:39,164;whether he knew it or not.
477;00:37:40,417;00:37:42,451;As they work through your mother.
478;00:37:44,705;00:37:46,755;There's so much good in all of us.
479;00:37:46,874;00:37:50,542;The best we can do is to help
479;00:37:46,874;00:37:50,542;each other bring it out.
480;00:38:18,789;00:38:20,572;Who are you?
481;00:38:20,657;00:38:22,074;No one.
482;00:38:23,961;00:38:26,461;Who were you
482;00:38:23,961;00:38:26,461;before you came here?
483;00:38:26,580;00:38:28,213;Arya Stark.
484;00:38:30,217;00:38:32,751;Tell me about
484;00:38:30,217;00:38:32,751;Arya Stark's family.
485;00:38:32,886;00:38:35,754;Her father was Eddard Stark.
486;00:38:35,839;00:38:38,390;Her mother was Catelyn Stark.
487;00:38:38,475;00:38:41,810;She had one sister, Sansa,
488;00:38:41,929;00:38:43,812;and four brothers.
489;00:38:53,524;00:38:55,273;Three brothers.
490;00:38:55,409;00:38:58,193;Robb, Bran, Rickon.
491;00:39:00,164;00:39:03,081;And a half-brother Jon.
492;00:39:04,251;00:39:06,585;And where are they now?
493;00:39:06,670;00:39:09,621;They may be dead
493;00:39:06,670;00:39:09,621;for all a girl knows.
494;00:39:19,933;00:39:21,349;Tell me about the Hound.
495;00:39:23,270;00:39:24,970;Also dead.
496;00:39:35,149;00:39:38,366;Arya Stark left him to die.
496;00:39:35,149;00:39:38,366;He was on her list.
497;00:39:40,821;00:39:43,955;He was not on her list anymore.
498;00:39:44,041;00:39:45,791;She had taken him off it.
499;00:39:45,876;00:39:49,961;Why? Didn't she want
499;00:39:45,876;00:39:49,961;him dead any longer?
500;00:39:53,801;00:39:56,051;She did and she did not.
501;00:39:59,556;00:40:02,674;She sounds confused.
502;00:40:07,347;00:40:11,183;Yes, she was.
503;00:40:15,405;00:40:18,156;Who else was on Arya
503;00:40:15,405;00:40:18,156;Stark's funny little list?
504;00:40:18,242;00:40:21,243;Cersei Lannister.
505;00:40:22,830;00:40:23,995;Gregor Clegane.
506;00:40:25,916;00:40:27,332;Walder Frey.
507;00:40:31,088;00:40:33,839;That's a short list.
508;00:40:37,711;00:40:40,345;That can't be everyone
508;00:40:37,711;00:40:40,345;you want to kill.
509;00:40:43,016;00:40:45,634;Are you sure you're not
509;00:40:43,016;00:40:45,634;forgetting someone?
510;00:40:48,639;00:40:51,723;Which name would you
510;00:40:48,639;00:40:51,723;like a girl to speak?
511;00:41:27,678;00:41:29,811;If a girl tells me her name,
512;00:41:29,930;00:41:32,314;I will give her eyes back.
513;00:41:35,269;00:41:37,235;A girl has no name.
514;00:41:40,941;00:41:41,941;Come.
515;00:42:15,475;00:42:17,642;If a girl is truly no one,
516;00:42:17,728;00:42:20,145;she has nothing to fear.
517;00:42:45,505;00:42:47,639;Who are you?
518;00:42:51,011;00:42:52,894;No one.
519;00:43:02,489;00:43:05,607;The Umbers are
519;00:43:02,489;00:43:05,607;a famously loyal house.
520;00:43:05,692;00:43:08,193;Famously loyal to the Starks.
521;00:43:08,278;00:43:11,329;And you, Lord Karstark.
522;00:43:11,415;00:43:14,199;Your people share blood with
522;00:43:11,415;00:43:14,199;the Starks, don't they?
523;00:43:14,334;00:43:16,951;But here we are.
523;00:43:14,334;00:43:16,951;Times change.
524;00:43:17,037;00:43:19,371;When my father became
524;00:43:17,037;00:43:19,371;Warden of the North,
525;00:43:19,456;00:43:21,456;your house refused
525;00:43:19,456;00:43:21,456;to pledge their banners.
526;00:43:21,541;00:43:23,341;Your father was a cunt.
527;00:43:26,546;00:43:28,763;My beloved father,
527;00:43:26,546;00:43:28,763;the Warden--
528;00:43:28,882;00:43:32,017;Your father was a cunt
528;00:43:28,882;00:43:32,017;and that's why you killed him.
529;00:43:32,102;00:43:34,936;I might have done
529;00:43:32,102;00:43:34,936;the same to my father
530;00:43:35,055;00:43:37,605;if he hadn't have done me
530;00:43:35,055;00:43:37,605;the favor of dying on his own.
531;00:43:37,724;00:43:40,525;My father was poisoned
531;00:43:37,724;00:43:40,525;by our enemies.
532;00:43:40,610;00:43:42,360;Mmm.
533;00:43:42,446;00:43:45,730;Why have you come to
533;00:43:42,446;00:43:45,730;Winterfell, Lord Umber?
534;00:43:45,866;00:43:49,701;The bastard Jon Snow led an army
534;00:43:45,866;00:43:49,701;of wildlings past the Wall.
535;00:43:49,786;00:43:52,203;We're farther north
535;00:43:49,786;00:43:52,203;than any of you fuckers.
536;00:43:52,289;00:43:55,573;Wildlings come down, we always
536;00:43:52,289;00:43:55,573;have to fight them first.
537;00:43:55,659;00:43:58,910;I like fighting wildlings.
537;00:43:55,659;00:43:58,910;Been doing it all my life.
538;00:43:58,995;00:44:01,746;But there are too many of them
538;00:43:58,995;00:44:01,746;for us to beat back alone.
539;00:44:01,832;00:44:04,716;So now you've come seeking help?
540;00:44:04,801;00:44:07,135;We need to help each other.
541;00:44:07,254;00:44:10,805;The colder it gets, the farther
541;00:44:07,254;00:44:10,805;south those goat fuckers will roam.
542;00:44:10,924;00:44:12,891;Won't take them long to get here.
543;00:44:12,976;00:44:15,810;You think a horde of wildlings
543;00:44:12,976;00:44:15,810;can take Winterfell?
544;00:44:15,929;00:44:17,529;If they get Jon Snow
544;00:44:15,929;00:44:17,529;leading them, maybe.
545;00:44:17,597;00:44:20,065;He knows this place
545;00:44:17,597;00:44:20,065;better than we ever will.
546;00:44:23,186;00:44:25,320;Pledge your banners to House Bolton.
547;00:44:25,439;00:44:27,939;Swear loyalty to me
547;00:44:25,439;00:44:27,939;as Warden of the North
548;00:44:28,075;00:44:30,575;and we will fight together
548;00:44:28,075;00:44:30,575;to destroy the bastard
549;00:44:30,660;00:44:32,160;and all his wildling friends.
550;00:44:32,279;00:44:34,446;I'm not kissing your fucking hand.
551;00:44:34,581;00:44:37,165;Traditionally a bannerman
551;00:44:34,581;00:44:37,165;kneels before his lord.
552;00:44:37,284;00:44:39,284;I'm not doing that either.
553;00:44:39,419;00:44:42,337;Why would I trust a man
553;00:44:39,419;00:44:42,337;who won't honor tradition?
554;00:44:42,456;00:44:45,290;Your father honored tradition.
555;00:44:45,375;00:44:47,592;Knelt for Robb Stark.
556;00:44:47,677;00:44:50,095;Called him King of the North.
557;00:44:50,180;00:44:52,347;Was Robb Stark right
557;00:44:50,180;00:44:52,347;to trust your father?
558;00:44:52,466;00:44:54,265;Then it appears we're
558;00:44:52,466;00:44:54,265;at a bit of an impasse.
559;00:44:54,351;00:44:57,469;Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths.
560;00:44:57,604;00:44:59,187;I've got a gift for you.
561;00:45:02,142;00:45:04,893;A girl, I hope.
561;00:45:02,142;00:45:04,893;I prefer redheads.
562;00:45:04,978;00:45:07,979;A girl, aye.
563;00:45:09,316;00:45:11,366;A wild one.
564;00:45:19,042;00:45:20,875;I like them wild.
565;00:45:21,962;00:45:25,463;And the boy, nice and young.
566;00:45:25,549;00:45:27,715;The way Karstark likes them.
567;00:45:33,507;00:45:35,006;Who's this?
568;00:45:35,091;00:45:37,475;Rickon Stark.
569;00:45:44,568;00:45:46,851;How do I know that's Rickon Stark?
570;00:46:17,551;00:46:20,385;Welcome home, Lord Stark.
571;00:46:31,865;00:46:33,615;It's time.
572;00:47:11,021;00:47:14,105;If you have any last
572;00:47:11,021;00:47:14,105;words, now is the time.
573;00:47:14,241;00:47:16,491;You shouldn't be alive.
574;00:47:16,610;00:47:18,526;It's not right.
575;00:47:19,696;00:47:21,496;Neither was killing me.
576;00:47:25,835;00:47:28,453;My mother's still
576;00:47:25,835;00:47:28,453;living at White Harbor.
577;00:47:28,588;00:47:30,455;Could you write her?
578;00:47:30,590;00:47:32,874;Tell her I died
578;00:47:30,590;00:47:32,874;fighting the wildlings.
579;00:47:41,301;00:47:45,019;I had a choice, Lord Commander.
580;00:47:45,138;00:47:49,107;Betray you or betray
580;00:47:45,138;00:47:49,107;the Night's Watch.
581;00:47:49,192;00:47:52,277;You brought an army of
581;00:47:49,192;00:47:52,277;wildlings into our lands.
582;00:47:54,147;00:47:56,981;An army of murderers and raiders.
583;00:47:57,117;00:48:00,818;If I had to do it all over
583;00:47:57,117;00:48:00,818;knowing where I'd end up,
584;00:48:00,904;00:48:04,322;I pray I'd make
584;00:48:00,904;00:48:04,322;the right choice again.
585;00:48:04,457;00:48:06,491;I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser.
586;00:48:06,576;00:48:09,577;I fought, I lost.
587;00:48:11,414;00:48:13,331;Now I rest.
588;00:48:14,334;00:48:18,252;But you, Lord Snow,
589;00:48:18,338;00:48:20,755;you'll be fighting
589;00:48:18,338;00:48:20,755;their battles forever.
590;00:50:07,947;00:50:09,864;We should burn the bodies.
591;00:50:11,367;00:50:12,867;You should.
592;00:50:21,628;00:50:23,928;What do you want me to do with this?
593;00:50:24,013;00:50:25,713;Wear it.
594;00:50:25,799;00:50:28,132;Burn it.
595;00:50:28,218;00:50:30,435;Whatever you want.
596;00:50:30,520;00:50:32,019;You have Castle Black.
597;00:50:38,812;00:50:41,028;My watch is ended.
