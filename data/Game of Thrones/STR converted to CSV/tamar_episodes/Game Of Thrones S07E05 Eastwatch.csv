145;00:12:24,220;00:12:25,470;Sue for peace?
146;00:12:26,800;00:12:28,390;I sit on her father's throne,
147;00:12:28,391;00:12:31,040;the father you betrayed
147;00:12:28,391;00:12:31,040;and murdered.
148;00:12:31,050;00:12:33,879;And in her mind, she's winning.
149;00:12:33,880;00:12:35,960;What sort of offer
149;00:12:33,880;00:12:35,960;do you think she'd make?
150;00:12:38,420;00:12:41,839;Maybe we can count on Tyrion
150;00:12:38,420;00:12:41,839;to intercede on our behalf
151;00:12:41,840;00:12:44,210;by way of apology for
151;00:12:41,840;00:12:44,210;murdering our father
151;00:12:41,840;00:12:44,210;and son.
152;00:12:45,970;00:12:47,469;He didn't.
153;00:12:47,470;00:12:49,469;You saw the crossbow,
153;00:12:47,470;00:12:49,469;you saw his body.
154;00:12:49,470;00:12:51,345;I'm not talking about Father.
155;00:12:51,346;00:12:54,879;Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.
155;00:12:51,346;00:12:54,879;He had nothing to do with it.
156;00:12:54,880;00:12:58,170;After all this time,
156;00:12:54,880;00:12:58,170;it still amazes me that you--
156;00:12:54,880;00:12:58,170;It was Olenna.
157;00:13:00,550;00:13:02,890;She confessed before she died.
158;00:13:05,170;00:13:07,419;And this was before or after
159;00:13:07,420;00:13:10,500;she drank the poison
159;00:13:07,420;00:13:10,500;you so kindly provided her?
160;00:13:10,510;00:13:12,129;After.
161;00:13:12,130;00:13:13,629;And you believed her?
162;00:13:13,630;00:13:16,379;If you were Olenna,
162;00:13:13,630;00:13:16,379;would you rather have seen
163;00:13:16,380;00:13:19,040;your granddaughter married
163;00:13:16,380;00:13:19,040;to Joffrey or Tommen?
164;00:13:21,420;00:13:23,790;Which one would Margaery
164;00:13:21,420;00:13:23,790;have been better able
164;00:13:21,420;00:13:23,790;to control?
165;00:13:23,800;00:13:25,350;Which one would have made Olenna
166;00:13:25,351;00:13:28,040;the true ruler
166;00:13:25,351;00:13:28,040;of the Seven Kingdoms?
167;00:13:28,050;00:13:29,930;She was telling the truth.
168;00:13:37,300;00:13:39,510;I shouldn't have
168;00:13:37,300;00:13:39,510;listened to you.
169;00:13:41,300;00:13:43,095;She should have died screaming.
170;00:13:43,096;00:13:44,379;She's dead, like her son,
171;00:13:44,380;00:13:46,460;her grandchildren,
171;00:13:44,380;00:13:46,460;her whole house.
172;00:13:46,470;00:13:50,049;And if we don't find
172;00:13:46,470;00:13:50,049;a way out of this war,
172;00:13:46,470;00:13:50,049;we'll follow them.
173;00:13:50,050;00:13:52,600;So we fight and die
173;00:13:50,050;00:13:52,600;or we submit and die.
174;00:13:52,601;00:13:54,750;I know my choice.
175;00:13:54,760;00:13:57,260;A soldier should know his.

183;00:16:06,550;00:16:09,350;It wasn't the word
183;00:16:06,550;00:16:09,350;I was thinking of, but...
184;00:16:10,590;00:16:13,339;but, yes, they are.
185;00:16:13,340;00:16:14,839;Gorgeous beasts.
186;00:16:14,840;00:16:16,750;They're not beasts to me.
187;00:16:16,760;00:16:18,589;No matter how big they get
188;00:16:18,590;00:16:20,750;or how terrifying
188;00:16:18,590;00:16:20,750;to everyone else,
189;00:16:20,760;00:16:22,390;they're my children.
190;00:16:28,050;00:16:29,390;You weren't gone long.
191;00:16:29,391;00:16:31,540;No.
192;00:16:31,550;00:16:33,549;And?
193;00:16:33,550;00:16:36,260;And I have
193;00:16:33,550;00:16:36,260;fewer enemies today
193;00:16:33,550;00:16:36,260;than I did yesterday.

194;00:16:38,920;00:16:41,000;how you feel about that.
195;00:16:41,010;00:16:42,720;No, I'm not.
196;00:16:44,630;00:16:46,089;How many men did your army kill
197;00:16:46,090;00:16:48,090;taking Winterfell back
197;00:16:46,090;00:16:48,090;from the Boltons?
198;00:16:49,260;00:16:50,629;Thousands.
199;00:16:50,630;00:16:52,750;We both want to help people.
200;00:16:52,760;00:16:56,469;We can only help them
200;00:16:52,760;00:16:56,469;from a position of strength.
201;00:16:56,470;00:16:58,550;Sometimes strength is terrible.
202;00:17:01,760;00:17:04,419;When you first came here,
203;00:17:04,420;00:17:08,169;Ser Davos said you took

211;00:17:46,470;00:17:47,969;I served with your father.
212;00:17:47,970;00:17:50,140;He was a great man.
213;00:17:51,670;00:17:53,340;You look strong.
214;00:17:55,170;00:17:56,500;You found a cure?
215;00:17:56,510;00:17:58,469;I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
216;00:17:58,470;00:18:02,969;I return

218;00:18:04,760;00:18:07,140;It would be my honor.

224;00:19:52,340;00:19:55,089;I put very little stock
224;00:19:52,340;00:19:55,089;in it myself.

225;00:19:55,090;00:19:57,540;are never in short supply,

227;00:19:59,760;00:20:02,089;I remember Wolkan.
228;00:20:02,090;00:20:04,460;A little timid,

235;00:20:19,426;00:20:21,089;Yes, it is a bit much.
236;00:20:21,090;00:20:23,790;Still, we ought
236;00:20:21,090;00:20:23,790;to write back--

238;00:20:31,630;00:20:33,790;I led him through

262;00:21:51,340;00:21:54,290;to lure southern armies away

274;00:22:21,510;00:22:24,140;who claimed descent from
274;00:22:21,510;00:22:24,140;the children of the forest.
275;00:22:24,141;00:22:26,919;( all chuckling )
275;00:22:24,141;00:22:26,919;Sandhu: Don't forget
275;00:22:24,141;00:22:26,919;the prophet Lodos,
276;00:22:26,920;00:22:30,589;who promised that
276;00:22:26,920;00:22:30,589;the Drowned God would rise up
276;00:22:26,920;00:22:30,589;and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.

277;00:22:30,590;00:22:32,880;Ah, Lodos.
278;00:22:36,170;00:22:40,710;Is he the one
278;00:22:36,170;00:22:40,710;whose father and brother
278;00:22:36,170;00:22:40,710;were just burnt alive?
279;00:22:40,720;00:22:42,669;I'm afraid so.
280;00:22:42,670;00:22:43,919;Horrible business.
281;00:22:43,920;00:22:46,540;I haven't had the heart
281;00:22:43,920;00:22:46,540;to tell him yet.
282;00:22:46,550;00:22:48,589;He's a good lad.
283;00:22:48,590;00:22:50,339;Right.
284;00:22:50,340;00:22:53,250;The ravenry was falling apart
284;00:22:50,340;00:22:53,250;the last time I checked.

286;00:22:58,470;00:23:01,095;All rulers demand
286;00:22:58,470;00:23:01,095;that people bend the knee.
287;00:23:01,096;00:23:02,290;That's why they're rulers.
288;00:23:05,420;00:23:07,419;She gave Tarly a choice,
289;00:23:07,420;00:23:10,250;a man who had taken up
289;00:23:07,420;00:23:10,250;arms against her.
290;00:23:10,260;00:23:12,009;What else could she do?
291;00:23:12,010;00:23:15,129;Not burn him alive
291;00:23:12,010;00:23:15,129;alongside his son?
292;00:23:15,130;00:23:17,460;I am her Hand, not her head.
293;00:23:17,470;00:23:19,719;I can't make
293;00:23:17,470;00:23:19,719;her decisions for her.
294;00:23:19,720;00:23:23,009;That's what I used
294;00:23:19,720;00:23:23,009;to tell myself about
294;00:23:19,720;00:23:23,009;her father.
295;00:23:23,010;00:23:27,379;I found the traitors,
295;00:23:23,010;00:23:27,379;but I wasn't the one
295;00:23:23,010;00:23:27,379;burning them alive.
296;00:23:27,380;00:23:30,130;I was only a purveyor
296;00:23:27,380;00:23:30,130;of information.
297;00:23:35,300;00:23:39,350;It's what I told myself
297;00:23:35,300;00:23:39,350;when I watched them
297;00:23:35,300;00:23:39,350;beg for mercy--
298;00:23:39,351;00:23:41,919;I'm not the one doing it.
299;00:23:41,920;00:23:44,379;When the pitch
299;00:23:41,920;00:23:44,379;of their screams
299;00:23:41,920;00:23:44,379;rose higher--
300;00:23:44,380;00:23:46,419;I'm not the one doing it.
301;00:23:46,420;00:23:48,000;When their hair caught fire
302;00:23:48,010;00:23:50,885;and the smell
302;00:23:48,010;00:23:50,885;of their burning flesh
302;00:23:48,010;00:23:50,885;filled the throne room--
303;00:23:50,886;00:23:52,500;I'm not the one doing it.

305;00:24:01,170;00:24:03,379;Daenerys is not her father.
306;00:24:03,380;00:24:05,790;And she never will be
307;00:24:05,800;00:24:07,850;with the right counsel.
308;00:24:11,090;00:24:13,500;You need to find a way
308;00:24:11,090;00:24:13,500;to make her listen.
309;00:24:15,970;00:24:19,339;Who's that for?
309;00:24:15,970;00:24:19,339;Jon Snow.
310;00:24:19,340;00:24:20,879;Did you read it?
311;00:24:20,880;00:24:23,920;It's a sealed scroll
311;00:24:20,880;00:24:23,920;for the King in the North.
312;00:24:30,050;00:24:31,510;What's it say?
313;00:24:32,590;00:24:34,170;Nothing good.
314;00:24:40,670;00:24:44,040;I thought Arya was dead.
315;00:24:44,050;00:24:47,129;I thought Bran was dead.
316;00:24:47,130;00:24:48,540;I'm happy for you.
317;00:24:50,920;00:24:52,339;You don't look happy.
318;00:24:52,340;00:24:54,710;Bran saw the Night King
318;00:24:52,340;00:24:54,710;and his army
319;00:24:54,720;00:24:56,720;marching towards Eastwatch.
320;00:24:58,300;00:25:00,299;If they make it past the Wall...
321;00:25:00,300;00:25:03,009;The Wall has kept them out
321;00:25:00,300;00:25:03,009;for thousands of years,
321;00:25:00,300;00:25:03,009;presumably.
322;00:25:03,010;00:25:04,669;I need to go home.
323;00:25:04,670;00:25:06,379;You said you don't
323;00:25:04,670;00:25:06,379;have enough men.
324;00:25:06,380;00:25:08,960;We'll fight
324;00:25:06,380;00:25:08,960;with the men we have.
325;00:25:08,970;00:25:10,589;Unless you'll join us.
326;00:25:10,590;00:25:12,750;And give the country to Cersei?
327;00:25:12,760;00:25:16,589;As soon as I march away,
327;00:25:12,760;00:25:16,589;she marches in.
328;00:25:16,590;00:25:18,919;Perhaps not.
329;00:25:18,920;00:25:22,339;Cersei thinks
329;00:25:18,920;00:25:22,339;the Army of the Dead
329;00:25:18,920;00:25:22,339;is nothing but a story
330;00:25:22,340;00:25:25,589;made up by wet nurses
330;00:25:22,340;00:25:25,589;to frighten children.
331;00:25:25,590;00:25:27,339;What if we prove her wrong?
332;00:25:27,340;00:25:30,750;I don't think
332;00:25:27,340;00:25:30,750;she'll come see
332;00:25:27,340;00:25:30,750;the dead at my invitation.
333;00:25:32,050;00:25:34,100;So bring the dead to her.
334;00:25:35,550;00:25:37,430;I thought that was what
334;00:25:35,550;00:25:37,430;we were trying to avoid.
335;00:25:37,431;00:25:39,790;We don't have to
335;00:25:37,431;00:25:39,790;bring the whole army.
336;00:25:39,800;00:25:41,839;Only one soldier.
337;00:25:41,840;00:25:43,750;Is that possible?
338;00:25:47,590;00:25:49,290;The first wight I ever saw
339;00:25:49,300;00:25:52,135;was brought
339;00:25:49,300;00:25:52,135;into Castle Black
339;00:25:49,300;00:25:52,135;from beyond the Wall.
340;00:25:52,136;00:25:54,460;Bring one of these things
340;00:25:52,136;00:25:54,460;down to King's Landing
341;00:25:54,470;00:25:56,759;and show her the truth.
342;00:25:56,760;00:25:58,799;Anything you bring back
342;00:25:56,760;00:25:58,799;will be useless
343;00:25:58,800;00:26:00,635;unless Cersei
343;00:25:58,800;00:26:00,635;grants us an audience
344;00:26:00,636;00:26:03,169;and is somehow convinced
344;00:26:00,636;00:26:03,169;not to murder us
345;00:26:03,170;00:26:05,419;the moment we set foot
345;00:26:03,170;00:26:05,419;in the capital.
346;00:26:05,420;00:26:09,000;The only person
346;00:26:05,420;00:26:09,000;she listens to is Jaime.
347;00:26:09,010;00:26:10,850;He might listen to me.
348;00:26:14,840;00:26:16,670;And how would you get
348;00:26:14,840;00:26:16,670;into King's Landing?
349;00:26:22,840;00:26:24,669;I can smuggle you in,
350;00:26:24,670;00:26:27,290;but if the gold cloaks
350;00:26:24,670;00:26:27,290;were to recognize you,
351;00:26:27,300;00:26:30,509;I'm warning you,
351;00:26:27,300;00:26:30,509;I'm not a fighter.
352;00:26:30,510;00:26:31,925;Well, it will all be for nothing
353;00:26:31,926;00:26:33,710;if we don't have
353;00:26:31,926;00:26:33,710;one of these dead men.
354;00:26:33,720;00:26:35,089;Fair point.
355;00:26:35,090;00:26:36,380;How do you propose to find one?
356;00:26:39,800;00:26:43,010;With the queen's permission,
356;00:26:39,800;00:26:43,010;I'll go north and take one.
357;00:26:44,720;00:26:48,049;You asked me
357;00:26:44,720;00:26:48,049;to find a cure
357;00:26:44,720;00:26:48,049;so I could serve you.
358;00:26:48,050;00:26:49,680;Allow me to serve you.
359;00:26:53,670;00:26:55,169;The Free Folk will help us.
360;00:26:55,170;00:26:57,919;They know the real north
360;00:26:55,170;00:26:57,919;better than anyone.
361;00:26:57,920;00:26:59,460;They won't follow Ser Jorah.
362;00:26:59,470;00:27:00,680;They won't have to.
363;00:27:07,720;00:27:10,129;You can't lead a raid
363;00:27:07,720;00:27:10,129;beyond the Wall.
364;00:27:10,130;00:27:12,750;You're not in

370;00:27:30,130;00:27:31,540;And I came here
371;00:27:31,550;00:27:33,390;knowing that you could
371;00:27:31,550;00:27:33,390;have your men behead me
372;00:27:33,391;00:27:36,589;or your dragons burn me alive.
373;00:27:36,590;00:27:41,000;I put my trust

379;00:28:14,260;00:28:18,600;should stay in the North.

381;00:28:25,510;00:28:28,350;we should have.

388;00:28:59,470;00:29:01,509;this would happen.
389;00:29:01,510;00:29:03,175;That he couldn't leave the North
390;00:29:03,176;00:29:06,000;and expect it to just sit
390;00:29:03,176;00:29:06,000;and wait for him like Ghost.
391;00:29:06,010;00:29:08,385;He didn't.

394;00:29:18,130;00:29:19,670;And?
395;00:29:22,380;00:29:24,710;Nothing.
396;00:29:24,720;00:29:27,509;Don't do that.
397;00:29:27,510;00:29:30,010;What?
397;00:29:27,510;00:29:30,010;Say what you mean.
398;00:29:31,670;00:29:34,130;You always liked nice things.
399;00:29:35,510;00:29:37,850;They made you feel
399;00:29:35,510;00:29:37,850;better than everyone.
400;00:29:42,760;00:29:44,339;Are you angry with me?
401;00:29:44,340;00:29:46,669;They were insulting Jon,
402;00:29:46,670;00:29:48,040;and you sat there and listened.
403;00:29:48,050;00:29:49,549;I listened to their complaints,
404;00:29:49,550;00:29:52,600;which is my responsibility
404;00:29:49,550;00:29:52,600;as Lady of Winterfell.
405;00:29:52,601;00:29:55,540;Their opinions
405;00:29:52,601;00:29:55,540;are important to you.
406;00:29:55,550;00:29:58,259;Glover has 500 men,
406;00:29:55,550;00:29:58,259;Royce has 2,000.
407;00:29:58,260;00:30:01,219;Offend them
407;00:29:58,260;00:30:01,219;and Jon loses his army.
408;00:30:01,220;00:30:03,220;Not if they lose
408;00:30:01,220;00:30:03,220;their heads first.
409;00:30:06,670;00:30:09,839;Winterfell didn't just
409;00:30:06,670;00:30:09,839;fall into our hands.
410;00:30:09,840;00:30:11,710;We took it back,
411;00:30:11,720;00:30:13,675;and the Mormonts
411;00:30:11,720;00:30:13,675;and the Hornwoods
412;00:30:13,676;00:30:15,129;and the wildlings and the Vale.
413;00:30:15,130;00:30:16,669;All of us, working together.
414;00:30:16,670;00:30:21,000;Now, I'm sure
414;00:30:16,670;00:30:21,000;cutting off heads
414;00:30:16,670;00:30:21,000;is very satisfying,
415;00:30:21,010;00:30:24,550;but that's not the way
415;00:30:21,010;00:30:24,550;you get people to
415;00:30:21,010;00:30:24,550;work together.
416;00:30:27,720;00:30:30,009;And if Jon doesn't come back,
417;00:30:30,010;00:30:31,969;you'll need their support...
418;00:30:31,970;00:30:34,089;so you can work together
419;00:30:34,090;00:30:36,040;to give you
419;00:30:34,090;00:30:36,040;what you really want.
420;00:30:36,050;00:30:38,640;How can you even think
420;00:30:36,050;00:30:38,640;such a horrible thing?
421;00:30:41,340;00:30:43,380;You're thinking it right now.
422;00:30:45,380;00:30:48,339;You don't want to be,
423;00:30:48,340;00:30:50,630;but the thought
423;00:30:48,340;00:30:50,630;just won't go away.
424;00:30:56,550;00:30:58,430;I have work to do.
425;00:31:02,090;00:31:03,380;My lady.
426;00:31:07,920;00:31:09,750;( door opens, closes )
427;00:31:15,420;00:31:18,669;Last time I was here,
427;00:31:15,420;00:31:18,669;I killed my father
427;00:31:15,420;00:31:18,669;with a crossbow.
428;00:31:18,670;00:31:21,630;Last time I was here,
428;00:31:18,670;00:31:21,630;you killed my son
428;00:31:18,670;00:31:21,630;with wildfire.
429;00:31:24,800;00:31:27,640;There's a path to the left
429;00:31:24,800;00:31:27,640;that hugs the cliff.
430;00:31:27,641;00:31:30,290;The guards
430;00:31:27,641;00:31:30,290;hardly ever patrol it.
431;00:31:30,300;00:31:31,680;Too many steps.
432;00:31:36,550;00:31:37,850;You're not staying here?
433;00:31:37,851;00:31:41,339;I've got my own business
433;00:31:37,851;00:31:41,339;in Flea Bottom.
434;00:31:41,340;00:31:43,169;What if someone takes the boat?
435;00:31:43,170;00:31:45,460;Then we're fucked.
435;00:31:43,170;00:31:45,460;Best hurry.
436;00:31:50,880;00:31:52,290;We don't have time for this.
437;00:31:52,300;00:31:54,469;We should be preparing
437;00:31:52,300;00:31:54,469;the city for a siege.
438;00:31:54,470;00:31:55,635;The Dothraki are coming.
439;00:31:55,636;00:31:57,750;All the more reason
439;00:31:55,636;00:31:57,750;for you to train.
440;00:31:57,760;00:31:59,759;Unless you plan on fighting
440;00:31:57,760;00:31:59,759;Dothraki 12-year-olds.
441;00:31:59,760;00:32:02,299;Well, I seem to recall them
441;00:31:59,760;00:32:02,299;giving you a bit of
441;00:31:59,760;00:32:02,299;trouble as well.
442;00:32:02,300;00:32:04,299;And here I am, ready to train.
443;00:32:04,300;00:32:06,259;Why down here?
444;00:32:06,260;00:32:08,100;I don't think
444;00:32:06,260;00:32:08,100;you want people to see
445;00:32:08,101;00:32:11,000;how you look swinging
445;00:32:08,101;00:32:11,000;that thing yet.
446;00:32:11,010;00:32:13,799;Today might be the day
446;00:32:11,010;00:32:13,799;I kill you by accident.
447;00:32:13,800;00:32:16,350;Oh, you won't be
447;00:32:13,800;00:32:16,350;swinging it at me.
448;00:32:24,550;00:32:26,220;I'll leave you to it.
449;00:32:30,010;00:32:31,350;I needed to see you.
450;00:32:32,800;00:32:34,640;And I knew you'd
450;00:32:32,800;00:32:34,640;never agree to meet.
451;00:32:38,170;00:32:41,129;You made me look
451;00:32:38,170;00:32:41,129;like a complete fool.
452;00:32:41,130;00:32:43,419;I thought I'd surprise you
452;00:32:41,130;00:32:43,419;by hitting Casterly Rock,
453;00:32:43,420;00:32:46,379;but you were
453;00:32:43,420;00:32:46,379;three steps ahead of me.
454;00:32:46,380;00:32:48,960;Abandoned the family home,
454;00:32:46,380;00:32:48,960;completely unsentimental.
455;00:32:48,970;00:32:50,469;Father would have been proud.
456;00:32:50,470;00:32:52,219;Don't talk about Father.
456;00:32:50,470;00:32:52,219;Listen to me--
457;00:32:52,220;00:32:53,719;I once told Bronn
458;00:32:53,720;00:32:56,550;that if I ever
458;00:32:53,720;00:32:56,550;saw you again,
458;00:32:53,720;00:32:56,550;I'd cut you in half.
459;00:32:59,550;00:33:02,050;It'll take you a while
459;00:32:59,550;00:33:02,050;with a sparring sword.
460;00:33:11,220;00:33:13,129;He was going to execute me.
461;00:33:13,130;00:33:15,839;He knew I was innocent.
462;00:33:15,840;00:33:18,169;He didn't hate me
462;00:33:15,840;00:33:18,169;because of anything I did,
463;00:33:18,170;00:33:20,540;he hated me
463;00:33:18,170;00:33:20,540;because of what I am.
464;00:33:20,550;00:33:23,720;A little monster
464;00:33:20,550;00:33:23,720;sent to punish him.
465;00:33:25,590;00:33:27,790;Did he--
465;00:33:25,590;00:33:27,790;did he think--
466;00:33:27,800;00:33:29,589;did he think I wanted
466;00:33:27,800;00:33:29,589;to be born this way?
467;00:33:29,590;00:33:31,470;Did he think I chose it--
467;00:33:29,590;00:33:31,470;What do you want?!
468;00:33:38,010;00:33:39,550;Daenerys will win this war.
469;00:33:41,920;00:33:43,339;You're a military man.
470;00:33:43,340;00:33:46,090;You must know
470;00:33:43,340;00:33:46,090;there's no way
470;00:33:43,340;00:33:46,090;around that.
471;00:33:48,130;00:33:49,710;Daenerys is not her father.
472;00:33:49,720;00:33:52,600;She's even willing
472;00:33:49,720;00:33:52,600;to suspend the hostilities
473;00:33:52,601;00:33:55,090;if Cersei agrees
473;00:33:52,601;00:33:55,090;to certain terms.
474;00:33:56,260;00:33:57,640;If you want Cersei
474;00:33:56,260;00:33:57,640;to bend the knee,
475;00:33:57,641;00:33:59,089;you can ask her yourself.
476;00:33:59,090;00:34:01,460;I-- I don't.
476;00:33:59,090;00:34:01,460;And Daenerys doesn't.
477;00:34:02,880;00:34:04,590;Not right now, anyway.
478;00:34:06,760;00:34:09,010;She has a more
478;00:34:06,760;00:34:09,010;important request.
479;00:34:12,470;00:34:14,640;( chatter )
480;00:34:48,510;00:34:50,720;I wasn't sure I'd find you.
481;00:34:58,010;00:35:00,009;Thought you might
481;00:34:58,010;00:35:00,009;still be rowing.
482;00:35:00,010;00:35:02,180;( chuckles )
483;00:35:03,630;00:35:06,710;I looked in shops,
483;00:35:03,630;00:35:06,710;taverns, brothels.
484;00:35:06,720;00:35:10,009;Should have known
484;00:35:06,720;00:35:10,009;to come straight to
484;00:35:06,720;00:35:10,009;the Street of Steel.
485;00:35:10,010;00:35:12,509;Aren't you worried
485;00:35:10,010;00:35:12,509;about the gold cloaks?
486;00:35:12,510;00:35:13,930;Haven't been here in years.
487;00:35:13,931;00:35:16,339;Why should they recognize me?
488;00:35:16,340;00:35:19,000;Sometimes I hardly do.
489;00:35:20,670;00:35:22,840;Nothing fucks you
489;00:35:20,670;00:35:22,840;harder than time.
490;00:35:27,630;00:35:29,710;Anybody give you any trouble?
491;00:35:29,720;00:35:32,169;Here I am, arming Lannisters,
492;00:35:32,170;00:35:34,040;and I never get a second look.
493;00:35:34,050;00:35:35,549;But you were right.
494;00:35:35,550;00:35:38,100;Safest place for me was
494;00:35:35,550;00:35:38,100;right under the queen's nose.
495;00:35:38,101;00:35:39,589;Don't be so sure.
496;00:35:39,590;00:35:42,500;Safety is never a permanent
496;00:35:39,590;00:35:42,500;state of affairs.
497;00:35:44,720;00:35:46,260;Bad things are coming.
498;00:35:48,760;00:35:51,719;You came to get me.
498;00:35:48,760;00:35:51,719;You want me to come with you.
499;00:35:51,720;00:35:53,850;Well, the thing you need
499;00:35:51,720;00:35:53,850;to understand is--
499;00:35:51,720;00:35:53,850;I'm ready.
500;00:35:53,851;00:35:55,290;You--
500;00:35:53,851;00:35:55,290;Let's go.
501;00:35:55,300;00:35:57,219;You should know
501;00:35:55,300;00:35:57,219;what you're heading into.
502;00:35:57,220;00:35:59,219;What do you think
502;00:35:57,220;00:35:59,219;I've been thinking about
503;00:35:59,220;00:36:00,600;with every swing of the hammer?
504;00:36:00,601;00:36:03,040;How happy I am making weapons
505;00:36:03,050;00:36:05,509;for the family
505;00:36:03,050;00:36:05,509;that killed my father?
506;00:36:05,510;00:36:07,219;The family that
506;00:36:05,510;00:36:07,219;tried to kill me?
507;00:36:07,220;00:36:09,339;( scoffs )
508;00:36:09,340;00:36:11,589;I've been getting ready.
509;00:36:11,590;00:36:13,040;I never knew what for,
510;00:36:13,050;00:36:15,600;but I've always known
510;00:36:13,050;00:36:15,600;I'd know it when it comes.
511;00:36:17,260;00:36:20,339;You might want to bring
511;00:36:17,260;00:36:20,339;one of those swords.
512;00:36:20,340;00:36:22,250;I don't know much
512;00:36:20,340;00:36:22,250;about swinging swords.
513;00:36:23,760;00:36:25,100;But this...
514;00:36:26,920;00:36:28,250;this I know.
515;00:36:37,340;00:36:38,750;Keep your father's name
515;00:36:37,340;00:36:38,750;to yourself.
516;00:36:38,760;00:36:41,550;Situation's complicated
516;00:36:38,760;00:36:41,550;enough already.
517;00:36:42,920;00:36:44,590;Well, who should I say I am?
518;00:36:48,420;00:36:50,839;I told you, Clovis,
518;00:36:48,420;00:36:50,839;if we don't get out
518;00:36:48,420;00:36:50,839;of here soon,
519;00:36:50,840;00:36:52,680;someone's going to--
519;00:36:50,840;00:36:52,680;Gold cloak: You there!
520;00:36:54,970;00:36:57,300;No weapons, friends.
520;00:36:54,970;00:36:57,300;I promise.

651;00:45:12,800;00:45:15,799;and pay us, remember?
652;00:45:15,800;00:45:19,640;It was supposed to last us

656;00:45:40,170;00:45:42,630;We should be better
656;00:45:40,170;00:45:42,630;at saying farewell by now.

659;00:46:05,470;00:46:06,830;with the King
