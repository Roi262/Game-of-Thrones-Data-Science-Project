49;00:04:37,960;00:04:39,079;No.
50;00:04:39,080;00:04:41,329;We can take the Seven Kingdoms

57;00:04:57,080;00:04:59,829;They joined our side, my queen,
58;00:04:59,830;00:05:02,369;because they believe in you.
59;00:05:02,370;00:05:04,700;You served my father,

60;00:05:06,040;00:05:07,329;I did.
61;00:05:07,330;00:05:08,669;And then you served

62;00:05:08,670;00:05:10,419;I had a choice,

64;00:05:12,540;00:05:14,869;But you didn't serve him long.
65;00:05:14,870;00:05:16,320;You turned against him.
66;00:05:17,790;00:05:21,499;Robert was an improvement
66;00:05:17,790;00:05:21,499;on your father, to be sure.
67;00:05:21,500;00:05:23,590;There have been

69;00:05:25,670;00:05:28,119;Robert was
69;00:05:25,670;00:05:28,119;neither mad nor cruel.
70;00:05:28,120;00:05:30,660;He simply had no interest

71;00:05:30,670;00:05:33,380;So you took it upon yourself
71;00:05:30,670;00:05:33,380;to find a better one.

75;00:05:40,620;00:05:43,530;you favored my brother.

77;00:05:48,250;00:05:51,920;did they tell you Viserys
77;00:05:48,250;00:05:51,920;was cruel, stupid, and weak?
78;00:05:54,040;00:05:58,539;Would those qualities
78;00:05:54,040;00:05:58,539;have made for a good king
78;00:05:54,040;00:05:58,539;in your learned opinion?
79;00:05:58,540;00:06:01,209;Until your marriage
79;00:05:58,540;00:06:01,209;to Khal Drogo, Your Grace,
80;00:06:01,210;00:06:03,709;I knew nothing about you,

82;00:06:06,040;00:06:09,749;So you and your friends
82;00:06:06,040;00:06:09,749;traded me like a prized horse
82;00:06:06,040;00:06:09,749;to the Dothraki.
83;00:06:09,750;00:06:11,749;Which you turned
83;00:06:09,750;00:06:11,749;to your advantage.
84;00:06:11,750;00:06:13,790;Who gave the order to kill me?

88;00:06:25,750;00:06:30,289;what had to be done to--
88;00:06:25,750;00:06:30,289;To keep yourself alive.

89;00:06:30,290;00:06:32,585;has proven himself

90;00:06:32,586;00:06:34,369;Proven himself loyal?
90;00:06:32,586;00:06:34,369;Quite the opposite.

92;00:06:38,080;00:06:40,499;What kind of a servant is that?
93;00:06:40,500;00:06:42,619;The kind the realm needs.
94;00:06:42,620;00:06:45,990;Incompetence should not

95;00:06:46,000;00:06:48,960;I'll use them.
96;00:06:50,670;00:06:52,669;I wasn't born
96;00:06:50,670;00:06:52,669;into a great house.
97;00:06:52,670;00:06:55,249;I came from nothing.
98;00:06:55,250;00:06:58,209;I was sold as a slave
98;00:06:55,250;00:06:58,209;and carved up as an offering.
99;00:06:58,210;00:07:02,039;When I was a child,
99;00:06:58,210;00:07:02,039;I lived in alleys, gutters,

100;00:07:02,040;00:07:04,625;You wish to know
100;00:07:02,040;00:07:04,625;where my true loyalties lie?
101;00:07:04,626;00:07:07,829;Not with any king or queen,
101;00:07:04,626;00:07:07,829;but with the people.
102;00:07:07,830;00:07:11,780;The people

102;00:07:07,830;00:07:11,780;and prosper under just rule.
103;00:07:11,790;00:07:14,170;The people whose hearts
103;00:07:11,790;00:07:14,170;you aim to win.
104;00:07:15,960;00:07:19,869;If you demand blind allegiance,
105;00:07:19,870;00:07:22,619;I respect your wishes.
106;00:07:22,620;00:07:26,619;Grey Worm can behead me
106;00:07:22,620;00:07:26,619;or your dragons
106;00:07:22,620;00:07:26,619;can devour me.
107;00:07:26,620;00:07:29,200;But if you let me live,
107;00:07:26,620;00:07:29,200;I will serve you well.
108;00:07:29,210;00:07:32,499;I will dedicate myself
108;00:07:29,210;00:07:32,499;to seeing you on
108;00:07:29,210;00:07:32,499;the Iron Throne
109;00:07:32,500;00:07:34,999;because I choose you.
110;00:07:35,000;00:07:38,540;Because I know the people
110;00:07:35,000;00:07:38,540;have no better chance
110;00:07:35,000;00:07:38,540;than you.
111;00:07:46,830;00:07:48,990;Swear this to me, Varys.
112;00:07:50,500;00:07:53,959;If you ever think

113;00:07:53,960;00:07:57,169;behind my back.
114;00:07:57,170;00:07:59,130;You'll look me in the eye
114;00:07:57,170;00:07:59,130;as you have done today,
115;00:07:59,131;00:08:00,950;and you'll tell me
115;00:07:59,131;00:08:00,950;how I'm failing them.
116;00:08:03,830;00:08:05,950;I swear it, my queen.
117;00:08:12,290;00:08:16,209;And I swear this--
117;00:08:12,290;00:08:16,209;if you ever betray me,
118;00:08:16,210;00:08:17,920;I'll burn you alive.
119;00:08:21,250;00:08:24,670;I would expect nothing less

150;00:10:34,000;00:10:38,125;singled out this Jon Snow?
151;00:10:38,126;00:10:40,829;Aside from the visions

154;00:10:46,000;00:10:48,079;to protect them

155;00:10:48,080;00:10:49,669;As King in the North,
156;00:10:49,670;00:10:52,499;he has united those wildlings
156;00:10:49,670;00:10:52,499;with the Northern houses,
157;00:10:52,500;00:10:54,999;so together they may

158;00:10:55,000;00:10:57,119;He sounds like quite a man.

180;00:12:00,080;00:12:03,590;It could be someone
180;00:12:00,080;00:12:03,590;trying to lure you
180;00:12:00,080;00:12:03,590;into a trap.
181;00:12:03,591;00:12:05,119;Read the last bit.

184;00:12:11,500;00:12:14,420;It's something he said to me
184;00:12:11,500;00:12:14,420;the first night we met.

238;00:15:03,540;00:15:05,249;Dickon.
239;00:15:05,250;00:15:06,789;That's it.
240;00:15:06,790;00:15:08,789;Thank you for coming.
241;00:15:08,790;00:15:12,709;The other lords of the Reach
241;00:15:08,790;00:15:12,709;look to you for guidance,
241;00:15:08,790;00:15:12,709;now more than ever.
242;00:15:12,710;00:15:14,419;They might not have come
242;00:15:12,710;00:15:14,419;if you hadn't.
243;00:15:14,420;00:15:17,709;If my queen summons me,
243;00:15:14,420;00:15:17,709;I answer the call.
244;00:15:17,710;00:15:20,500;And I've heard
244;00:15:17,710;00:15:20,500;what she does to
244;00:15:17,710;00:15:20,500;those who defy her.
245;00:15:23,370;00:15:25,740;You ride for Horn Hill today?
246;00:15:25,750;00:15:28,459;I have an army to mobilize.
247;00:15:28,460;00:15:30,789;Won't be long before
247;00:15:28,460;00:15:30,789;the fighting starts.
248;00:15:30,790;00:15:33,250;And which side
248;00:15:30,790;00:15:33,250;will you be fighting for?
249;00:15:34,830;00:15:37,579;You were the only man to defeat
249;00:15:34,830;00:15:37,579;Robert Baratheon in battle.
250;00:15:37,580;00:15:39,490;Not even Rhaegar Targaryen
250;00:15:37,580;00:15:39,490;could do that.
251;00:15:39,500;00:15:42,459;It's a long ride back
251;00:15:39,500;00:15:42,459;to the Reach, Ser Jaime.
251;00:15:39,500;00:15:42,459;How may I serve?
252;00:15:42,460;00:15:45,419;I want you to be
252;00:15:42,460;00:15:45,419;my ranking general
252;00:15:42,460;00:15:45,419;in the wars to come.
253;00:15:45,420;00:15:47,539;I want you to swear
253;00:15:45,420;00:15:47,539;allegiance to Cersei
254;00:15:47,540;00:15:50,539;and I want you to help me
254;00:15:47,540;00:15:50,539;destroy her enemies.
255;00:15:50,540;00:15:52,369;All her enemies.
256;00:15:52,370;00:15:54,410;Including Olenna Tyrell.
257;00:15:57,170;00:15:59,669;I'm a Tarly.
258;00:15:59,670;00:16:01,170;That name means something.
259;00:16:02,670;00:16:05,209;We're not oathbreakers.
259;00:16:02,670;00:16:05,209;We're not schemers.
260;00:16:05,210;00:16:07,669;We don't stab
260;00:16:05,210;00:16:07,669;our rivals in the back
261;00:16:07,670;00:16:10,500;or cut their throats
261;00:16:07,670;00:16:10,500;at weddings.
262;00:16:12,620;00:16:15,530;I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
263;00:16:15,540;00:16:18,880;You swore an oath
263;00:16:15,540;00:16:18,880;to the crown as well,
263;00:16:15,540;00:16:18,880;Lord Tarly.
264;00:16:20,290;00:16:22,669;I've known Olenna
264;00:16:20,290;00:16:22,669;since I was a child.
265;00:16:22,670;00:16:25,289;She was a great woman once.
266;00:16:25,290;00:16:27,669;Now she's broken.
267;00:16:27,670;00:16:29,789;She wants revenge so badly,
268;00:16:29,790;00:16:32,039;she brought the Dothraki
268;00:16:29,790;00:16:32,039;to our shores.
269;00:16:32,040;00:16:35,960;The Dothraki in Westeros
269;00:16:32,040;00:16:35,960;for the first time
269;00:16:32,040;00:16:35,960;in history.
270;00:16:38,620;00:16:40,869;I know you don't like my sister,
271;00:16:40,870;00:16:44,030;but you have to make a choice.
272;00:16:44,040;00:16:46,079;Do you fight with us
273;00:16:46,080;00:16:48,210;or with foreign savages
273;00:16:46,080;00:16:48,210;and eunuchs?
274;00:16:53,460;00:16:55,709;When the war is won,
275;00:16:55,710;00:16:58,869;the queen will need
275;00:16:55,710;00:16:58,869;a new Warden of the South.
276;00:16:58,870;00:17:01,700;I can think of no better man
277;00:17:01,710;00:17:03,540;than Randyll Tarly.
278;00:17:05,580;00:17:08,369;Ebrose:
278;00:17:05,580;00:17:08,369;The infection
278;00:17:05,580;00:17:08,369;has spread too far.
279;00:17:08,370;00:17:11,320;You should have
279;00:17:08,370;00:17:11,320;cut off your arm
279;00:17:08,370;00:17:11,320;the moment you were touched.
280;00:17:14,040;00:17:15,170;How long?
281;00:17:17,920;00:17:20,039;It'll be years
281;00:17:17,920;00:17:20,039;before it kills you.
282;00:17:20,040;00:17:21,619;Could be 10.
283;00:17:21,620;00:17:23,280;Could be 20.
284;00:17:23,290;00:17:25,040;But how long until...?
285;00:17:26,460;00:17:28,539;Your mind?
286;00:17:28,540;00:17:31,420;Six months, maybe fewer.
287;00:17:38,710;00:17:39,710;( grunts )
288;00:17:44,080;00:17:45,210;Um...
289;00:17:46,750;00:17:49,919;Pardon, Archmaester.
290;00:17:49,920;00:17:52,919;I met Stannis Baratheon's
290;00:17:49,920;00:17:52,919;daughter at Castle Black.
291;00:17:52,920;00:17:55,375;She had the greyscale
291;00:17:52,920;00:17:55,375;as a baby and was cured.
292;00:17:55,376;00:17:56,950;Ebrose: No.
292;00:17:55,376;00:17:56,950;Isn't there some way--
293;00:17:56,960;00:17:58,749;Ebrose:
293;00:17:56,960;00:17:58,749;Does this look like
293;00:17:56,960;00:17:58,749;a baby to you?
294;00:17:58,750;00:18:00,079;No.
294;00:17:58,750;00:18:00,079;Have you studied
295;00:18:00,080;00:18:02,125;the varying rates
295;00:18:00,080;00:18:02,125;of greyscale progression
296;00:18:02,126;00:18:03,740;in infants and fully grown men?
297;00:18:05,790;00:18:07,170;No.
298;00:18:08,960;00:18:10,539;Ebrose:
298;00:18:08,960;00:18:10,539;Maester Cressen discovered
299;00:18:10,540;00:18:13,130;Shireen Baratheon's
299;00:18:10,540;00:18:13,130;affliction immediately.
300;00:18:14,580;00:18:16,280;This is quite advanced.
301;00:18:18,120;00:18:20,320;And beyond our skills, ser.
302;00:18:23,790;00:18:26,749;Were you a commoner,
302;00:18:23,790;00:18:26,749;I'd have you shipped
302;00:18:23,790;00:18:26,749;to Valyria at once
303;00:18:26,750;00:18:29,289;to live out your life
303;00:18:26,750;00:18:29,289;with the stone men.
304;00:18:29,290;00:18:33,130;As an anointed knight,
304;00:18:29,290;00:18:33,130;I'll allow you one more day.
305;00:18:35,920;00:18:38,460;How you choose
305;00:18:35,920;00:18:38,460;to spend that time
305;00:18:35,920;00:18:38,460;is up to you.
306;00:18:44,960;00:18:45,960;Come, Samwell.
307;00:18:49,830;00:18:52,700;Should we send word
307;00:18:49,830;00:18:52,700;to your family, Ser...?
308;00:18:54,330;00:18:55,330;Jorah.
309;00:18:57,170;00:18:59,669;Jorah Mormont.
310;00:18:59,670;00:19:01,709;Mormont?
311;00:19:01,710;00:19:03,459;There's no need.
312;00:19:03,460;00:19:06,040;I've been dead
312;00:19:03,460;00:19:06,040;to them for years.
313;00:19:07,710;00:19:09,380;Ebrose:
313;00:19:07,710;00:19:09,380;Come, Samwell!
314;00:19:22,330;00:19:25,249;Qyburn:
314;00:19:22,330;00:19:25,249;Have you ever been
314;00:19:22,330;00:19:25,249;down here, Your Grace?
315;00:19:25,250;00:19:26,750;No, I can't say I have.
316;00:19:29,000;00:19:32,459;I haven't seen these
316;00:19:29,000;00:19:32,459;since Robert had them
316;00:19:29,000;00:19:32,459;removed from the throne room.
317;00:19:32,460;00:19:36,419;Curious that King Robert
317;00:19:32,460;00:19:36,419;did not have them destroyed.
318;00:19:36,420;00:19:38,579;They were his trophies.
319;00:19:38,580;00:19:39,780;He couldn't keep them around.
320;00:19:39,790;00:19:41,709;They would have
320;00:19:39,790;00:19:41,709;made him look small.
321;00:19:41,710;00:19:45,250;Sometimes
321;00:19:41,710;00:19:45,250;he would come down here
321;00:19:41,710;00:19:45,250;and look at them.
322;00:19:47,710;00:19:50,420;I believe he brought
322;00:19:47,710;00:19:50,420;his whores on occasion.
323;00:19:57,750;00:19:59,540;Balerion the Dread.
324;00:20:01,370;00:20:03,950;The beast that Aegon
324;00:20:01,370;00:20:03,950;rode across the sea.
325;00:20:03,960;00:20:06,869;His flames forged
325;00:20:03,960;00:20:06,869;the Iron Throne
326;00:20:06,870;00:20:09,740;and brought
326;00:20:06,870;00:20:09,740;the Seven Kingdoms
326;00:20:06,870;00:20:09,740;to heel.
327;00:20:10,920;00:20:12,080;Powerful...
328;00:20:13,210;00:20:14,630;but not invincible.
329;00:20:19,080;00:20:22,419;Apparently,
329;00:20:19,080;00:20:22,419;one of Daenerys's dragons
330;00:20:22,420;00:20:26,080;was wounded by spears
330;00:20:22,420;00:20:26,080;in the fighting pits
330;00:20:22,420;00:20:26,080;of Meereen.
331;00:20:27,580;00:20:29,910;And if they can be wounded,
332;00:20:29,920;00:20:31,290;they can be killed.
333;00:20:33,580;00:20:36,579;The finest artillators
333;00:20:33,580;00:20:36,579;and blacksmiths in
333;00:20:33,580;00:20:36,579;King's Landing
334;00:20:36,580;00:20:39,410;have been laboring
334;00:20:36,580;00:20:39,410;day and night,
334;00:20:36,580;00:20:39,410;Your Grace.
335;00:20:45,960;00:20:48,460;If you'll kindly
335;00:20:45,960;00:20:48,460;pull that lever.
336;00:21:04,920;00:21:07,460;Yara:
336;00:21:04,920;00:21:07,460;If you want
336;00:21:04,920;00:21:07,460;the Iron Throne, take it.
337;00:21:09,540;00:21:12,619;We have an army, a fleet,
337;00:21:09,540;00:21:12,619;and three dragons.
338;00:21:12,620;00:21:16,280;We should hit
338;00:21:12,620;00:21:16,280;King's Landing now, hard,
338;00:21:12,620;00:21:16,280;with everything we have.
339;00:21:16,290;00:21:18,789;The city will fall within a day.
340;00:21:18,790;00:21:21,709;If we turn the dragons loose,
340;00:21:18,790;00:21:21,709;tens of thousands will die
340;00:21:18,790;00:21:21,709;in the firestorms.
341;00:21:21,710;00:21:23,289;It's called war.
342;00:21:23,290;00:21:26,289;You don't have
342;00:21:23,290;00:21:26,289;the stomach for it,
342;00:21:23,290;00:21:26,289;scurry back into hiding.
343;00:21:26,290;00:21:27,630;I know how you wage war.
344;00:21:27,631;00:21:30,369;We don't poison
344;00:21:27,631;00:21:30,369;little girls here.
345;00:21:30,370;00:21:31,660;Myrcella was innocent.
346;00:21:31,670;00:21:33,039;She was a Lannister.
347;00:21:33,040;00:21:35,669;There are no
347;00:21:33,040;00:21:35,669;innocent Lannisters.
348;00:21:35,670;00:21:38,959;My greatest regret
348;00:21:35,670;00:21:38,959;is that Oberyn died
348;00:21:35,670;00:21:38,959;fighting for you.
349;00:21:38,960;00:21:40,829;Daenerys:
349;00:21:38,960;00:21:40,829;That's enough.
350;00:21:40,830;00:21:42,410;Lord Tyrion
350;00:21:40,830;00:21:42,410;is Hand of the Queen.
351;00:21:42,420;00:21:43,840;You will treat him with respect.
352;00:21:47,790;00:21:50,840;I am not here to be
352;00:21:47,790;00:21:50,840;queen of the ashes.
353;00:21:52,080;00:21:54,249;That's very nice to hear.
354;00:21:54,250;00:21:56,209;Of course,
354;00:21:54,250;00:21:56,209;I can't remember a queen
355;00:21:56,210;00:21:59,169;who was better loved

356;00:21:59,170;00:22:01,119;The common people loved her.
357;00:22:01,120;00:22:02,869;The nobles loved her.
358;00:22:02,870;00:22:04,619;And what is left of her now?
359;00:22:04,620;00:22:07,450;Ashes.
360;00:22:07,460;00:22:09,169;Commoners, nobles,
361;00:22:09,170;00:22:11,039;they're all
361;00:22:09,170;00:22:11,039;just children, really.
362;00:22:11,040;00:22:14,670;They won't obey you
362;00:22:11,040;00:22:14,670;unless they fear you.
363;00:22:16,670;00:22:18,919;I'm grateful
363;00:22:16,670;00:22:18,919;to you, Lady Olenna,
363;00:22:16,670;00:22:18,919;for your counsel.
364;00:22:18,920;00:22:20,829;I'm grateful to all of you.
365;00:22:20,830;00:22:23,450;But you have chosen
365;00:22:20,830;00:22:23,450;to follow me.
366;00:22:23,460;00:22:25,829;I will not attack
366;00:22:23,460;00:22:25,829;King's Landing.
367;00:22:25,830;00:22:28,660;We will not attack
367;00:22:25,830;00:22:28,660;King's Landing.
368;00:22:28,670;00:22:32,329;Then how do you mean
368;00:22:28,670;00:22:32,329;to take the Iron Throne?
369;00:22:32,330;00:22:33,670;By asking nicely?
370;00:22:35,790;00:22:37,209;We will lay siege
370;00:22:35,790;00:22:37,209;to the capital,
371;00:22:37,210;00:22:38,919;surrounding the city
371;00:22:37,210;00:22:38,919;on all sides.
372;00:22:38,920;00:22:40,709;Cersei will have
372;00:22:38,920;00:22:40,709;the Iron Throne,
373;00:22:40,710;00:22:43,079;but no food for her army
373;00:22:40,710;00:22:43,079;or the people.
374;00:22:43,080;00:22:45,999;But we won't use
374;00:22:43,080;00:22:45,999;Dothraki and Unsullied.
375;00:22:46,000;00:22:48,039;Cersei will try to rally
375;00:22:46,000;00:22:48,039;the lords of Westeros
376;00:22:48,040;00:22:49,709;by appealing to their loyalty,
377;00:22:49,710;00:22:51,375;their love for their country.
378;00:22:51,376;00:22:53,280;If we besiege the city
378;00:22:51,376;00:22:53,280;with foreigners,
379;00:22:53,290;00:22:54,999;we prove her point.
380;00:22:55,000;00:22:56,625;Our army should be Westerosi.
381;00:22:56,626;00:22:58,910;And I suppose
381;00:22:56,626;00:22:58,910;we're providing
381;00:22:56,626;00:22:58,910;the Westerosi?
382;00:22:58,920;00:23:00,209;You are.
383;00:23:00,210;00:23:03,590;Lady Greyjoy
383;00:23:00,210;00:23:03,590;will escort you home
383;00:23:00,210;00:23:03,590;to Sunspear.
384;00:23:06,500;00:23:09,590;And her Iron Fleet
384;00:23:06,500;00:23:09,590;will ferry the Dornish army
385;00:23:09,591;00:23:11,579;back up to King's Landing.
386;00:23:11,580;00:23:14,410;The Dornish
386;00:23:11,580;00:23:14,410;will lay siege
386;00:23:11,580;00:23:14,410;to the capital
387;00:23:14,420;00:23:16,459;alongside the Tyrell army.
388;00:23:16,460;00:23:19,130;Two great kingdoms
388;00:23:16,460;00:23:19,130;united against Cersei.
389;00:23:19,131;00:23:24,240;So, your master plan
389;00:23:19,131;00:23:24,240;is to use our armies.
390;00:23:24,250;00:23:27,630;Forgive me for asking,
390;00:23:24,250;00:23:27,630;but why did you bother
390;00:23:24,250;00:23:27,630;to bring your own?
391;00:23:29,080;00:23:32,119;The Unsullied will have
391;00:23:29,080;00:23:32,119;another objective.
392;00:23:32,120;00:23:35,700;For decades,
392;00:23:32,120;00:23:35,700;House Lannister has been
392;00:23:32,120;00:23:35,700;the true power in Westeros.
393;00:23:35,710;00:23:39,869;And the seat of that power
393;00:23:35,710;00:23:39,869;is Casterly Rock.
394;00:23:39,870;00:23:41,780;Grey Worm and the Unsullied
395;00:23:41,790;00:23:44,670;will sail for the Rock
395;00:23:41,790;00:23:44,670;and take it.
396;00:24:03,210;00:24:04,840;Do I have your support?
397;00:24:06,620;00:24:07,990;You have mine.
398;00:24:09,790;00:24:11,670;Dorne is with you, Your Grace.
399;00:24:15,870;00:24:17,320;Thank you all.
400;00:24:19,040;00:24:20,670;Lady Olenna, may I speak
400;00:24:19,040;00:24:20,670;with you alone?
401;00:24:27,870;00:24:29,619;( door closes )
402;00:24:29,620;00:24:34,030;I realize you're here
402;00:24:29,620;00:24:34,030;out of hatred for Cersei
402;00:24:29,620;00:24:34,030;and not love for me.
403;00:24:34,040;00:24:37,959;But I swear to you,
403;00:24:34,040;00:24:37,959;she will pay for
403;00:24:34,040;00:24:37,959;what she's done.
404;00:24:37,960;00:24:40,630;And we will bring peace
404;00:24:37,960;00:24:40,630;back to Westeros.
405;00:24:40,631;00:24:42,660;Peace?
406;00:24:42,670;00:24:45,329;Do you think
406;00:24:42,670;00:24:45,329;that's what we had
406;00:24:42,670;00:24:45,329;under your father?
407;00:24:45,330;00:24:48,459;Or his father?
407;00:24:45,330;00:24:48,459;Or his?
408;00:24:48,460;00:24:51,119;Peace never lasts, my dear.
409;00:24:51,120;00:24:53,450;Will you take
409;00:24:51,120;00:24:53,450;a bit of advice
409;00:24:51,120;00:24:53,450;from an old woman?
410;00:24:55,500;00:24:57,459;He's a clever man, your Hand.
411;00:24:57,460;00:25:01,289;I've known
411;00:24:57,460;00:25:01,289;a great many clever men.
412;00:25:01,290;00:25:03,209;I've outlived them all.
413;00:25:03,210;00:25:05,119;You know why?
414;00:25:05,120;00:25:06,660;I ignored them.
415;00:25:06,670;00:25:10,169;The lords of Westeros are sheep.
416;00:25:10,170;00:25:11,540;Are you a sheep?
417;00:25:13,250;00:25:14,869;No.

419;00:25:17,170;00:25:18,710;Be a dragon.

422;00:25:29,750;00:25:31,170;You leave tomorrow.
423;00:25:34,000;00:25:36,419;Were you going to say goodbye?
424;00:25:36,420;00:25:39,039;I will see you when I return.
425;00:25:39,040;00:25:40,920;But you don't know
425;00:25:39,040;00:25:40,920;when that will be.
426;00:25:42,920;00:25:43,920;No one knows.
427;00:25:46,750;00:25:48,750;I wish you good fortune.

429;00:26:00,790;00:26:03,249;It is hard for me
429;00:26:00,790;00:26:03,249;to say goodbye to you.
430;00:26:03,250;00:26:04,459;Why?
431;00:26:04,460;00:26:06,119;You know why.
432;00:26:06,120;00:26:07,200;I don't.
433;00:26:10,460;00:26:13,880;Y-you are my weakness.
434;00:26:15,210;00:26:17,329;That's what I am?
435;00:26:17,330;00:26:18,789;Your weakness?
436;00:26:18,790;00:26:22,500;When Unsullied are young,
436;00:26:18,790;00:26:22,500;the masters learn their fears.
437;00:26:23,920;00:26:26,459;One boy is scared of dogs,

440;00:26:31,170;00:26:33,619;They make the boy
440;00:26:31,170;00:26:33,619;sleep with dogs
441;00:26:33,620;00:26:35,530;or climb a cliff.
442;00:26:35,540;00:26:37,829;They throw him in the water.
443;00:26:37,830;00:26:40,119;If he learns to swim, good.
444;00:26:40,120;00:26:42,070;If he drowns, good.

446;00:26:46,290;00:26:48,709;But I had no fears.
447;00:26:48,710;00:26:52,500;I was never the biggest,

448;00:26:54,080;00:26:57,170;but I was bravest, always.
449;00:26:58,620;00:27:00,579;I believe it.

458;00:30:11,960;00:30:13,119;Might be useful.
459;00:30:13,120;00:30:14,990;Ch'Vyalthan was
459;00:30:13,120;00:30:14,990;a dreadful writer,
460;00:30:15,000;00:30:16,835;but an excellent researcher.

462;00:30:19,290;00:30:21,169;Maester Faull was
462;00:30:19,290;00:30:21,169;quite the opposite--
463;00:30:21,170;00:30:23,919;a brilliant stylist who
463;00:30:21,170;00:30:23,919;invented half the stories

464;00:30:23,920;00:30:25,539;Um, I wanted
464;00:30:23,920;00:30:25,539;to ask you--
465;00:30:25,540;00:30:27,329;If you're going
465;00:30:25,540;00:30:27,329;to write histories, Tarly,
466;00:30:27,330;00:30:28,919;you have to do the research.
467;00:30:28,920;00:30:30,789;If you want people
467;00:30:28,920;00:30:30,789;to read your histories,
468;00:30:30,790;00:30:33,039;you need a bit of style.
469;00:30:33,040;00:30:35,039;I'm not writing

472;00:30:41,500;00:30:44,000;You don't
472;00:30:41,500;00:30:44,000;like the title?
473;00:30:45,210;00:30:46,539;What would you call it, then?
474;00:30:46,540;00:30:49,869;Mm, possibly something
474;00:30:46,540;00:30:49,869;a bit more poetic?
475;00:30:49,870;00:30:52,619;We're not poets, Tarly.

532;00:35:36,580;00:35:39,619;prices will triple.

539;00:36:05,000;00:36:06,710;Mm. This is good.
540;00:36:08,710;00:36:10,169;You think so?
541;00:36:10,170;00:36:12,919;The secret
541;00:36:10,170;00:36:12,919;is browning the butter
541;00:36:10,170;00:36:12,919;before making the dough.
542;00:36:12,920;00:36:15,880;Most people don't do that
542;00:36:12,920;00:36:15,880;'cause it takes up
542;00:36:12,920;00:36:15,880;too much time.
543;00:36:15,881;00:36:17,490;Mm, I didn't do that.
544;00:36:17,500;00:36:19,039;You've been making pies?
545;00:36:19,040;00:36:21,369;One or two.
546;00:36:21,370;00:36:23,369;I can't believe you're here.
547;00:36:23,370;00:36:25,829;Did you meet the big lady?

549;00:36:28,830;00:36:31,030;I figured she was a knight
549;00:36:28,830;00:36:31,030;'cause she had armor on.
550;00:36:31,040;00:36:34,880;She was looking
550;00:36:31,040;00:36:34,880;for your sister,
550;00:36:31,040;00:36:34,880;but I told her about you.
551;00:36:34,881;00:36:36,370;Did she ever find you?
552;00:36:37,960;00:36:39,330;She found me.

554;00:36:56,370;00:36:57,370;You got any ale?

557;00:37:14,920;00:37:17,419;Why?
557;00:37:14,920;00:37:17,419;Heard Cersei's
557;00:37:14,920;00:37:17,419;queen now.
558;00:37:17,420;00:37:18,999;Heard she blew up
558;00:37:17,420;00:37:18,999;the Great Sept.
559;00:37:19,000;00:37:20,590;That must have been
559;00:37:19,000;00:37:20,590;something to see.

560;00:37:20,591;00:37:22,369;Mm.
561;00:37:22,370;00:37:24,579;I can't believe
561;00:37:22,370;00:37:24,579;someone would do that.
562;00:37:24,580;00:37:26,120;Cersei would do that.
563;00:37:28,290;00:37:31,329;I thought you'd be
563;00:37:28,290;00:37:31,329;heading for Winterfell.
564;00:37:31,330;00:37:33,459;Why would I go there?
564;00:37:31,330;00:37:33,459;The Boltons have it.
565;00:37:33,460;00:37:35,920;No, the Boltons are dead.

567;00:37:39,290;00:37:41,459;Jon Snow came down

571;00:37:47,460;00:37:49,329;Why would I lie about that?
572;00:37:49,330;00:37:50,790;He's your brother, right?
573;00:37:57,710;00:38:00,130;Thanks for the pie.

618;00:40:48,120;00:40:51,410;and persuade her
618;00:40:48,120;00:40:51,410;to fight with us.
619;00:40:51,420;00:40:54,539;Ser Davos and I will ride
619;00:40:51,420;00:40:54,539;for White Harbor tomorrow,
620;00:40:54,540;00:40:56,959;then sail for Dragonstone.
621;00:40:56,960;00:40:59,875;Have you forgotten
621;00:40:56,960;00:40:59,875;what happened to
621;00:40:56,960;00:40:59,875;our grandfather?
622;00:40:59,876;00:41:02,070;The Mad King invited him
622;00:40:59,876;00:41:02,070;to King's Landing
623;00:41:02,080;00:41:04,375;and roasted him alive.
623;00:41:02,080;00:41:04,375;I know that.
624;00:41:04,376;00:41:07,490;She is here to
624;00:41:04,376;00:41:07,490;reclaim the Iron Throne
624;00:41:04,376;00:41:07,490;and the Seven Kingdoms.
625;00:41:07,500;00:41:09,499;The North is one
625;00:41:07,500;00:41:09,499;of those seven kingdoms.
626;00:41:09,500;00:41:12,329;"This isn't an invitation;"
626;00:41:09,500;00:41:12,329;it's a trap.
627;00:41:12,330;00:41:15,630;It could be,
627;00:41:12,330;00:41:15,630;but I don't believe
627;00:41:12,330;00:41:15,630;Tyrion would do that.
628;00:41:15,631;00:41:17,990;You know him.
628;00:41:15,631;00:41:17,990;He's a good man.
629;00:41:18,000;00:41:21,829;Your Grace, with respect,
629;00:41:18,000;00:41:21,829;I must agree with Lady Sansa.
630;00:41:21,830;00:41:24,910;I remember the Mad King
630;00:41:21,830;00:41:24,910;all too well.
631;00:41:24,920;00:41:27,669;A Targaryen cannot be trusted.
632;00:41:27,670;00:41:29,880;Nor can a Lannister.
632;00:41:27,670;00:41:29,880;All: Yeah!
633;00:41:29,881;00:41:33,320;Aye. We called
633;00:41:29,881;00:41:33,320;your brother king.
634;00:41:33,330;00:41:37,249;And then he rode south
634;00:41:33,330;00:41:37,249;and lost his kingdom.
635;00:41:37,250;00:41:41,039;Winter is here, Your Grace.
636;00:41:41,040;00:41:43,919;We need
636;00:41:41,040;00:41:43,919;the King in the North
636;00:41:41,040;00:41:43,919;in the North.
637;00:41:43,920;00:41:47,250;Men: Aye!

638;00:41:55,670;00:41:58,000;You all crowned me your king.
639;00:41:59,870;00:42:02,200;I never wanted it.
640;00:42:02,210;00:42:04,669;I never asked for it.
641;00:42:04,670;00:42:08,959;But I accepted it
641;00:42:04,670;00:42:08,959;because the North
641;00:42:04,670;00:42:08,959;is my home.
642;00:42:08,960;00:42:13,249;It's part of me,
642;00:42:08,960;00:42:13,249;and I will never
642;00:42:08,960;00:42:13,249;stop fighting for it,
643;00:42:13,250;00:42:14,670;no matter the odds.
644;00:42:17,370;00:42:19,320;But the odds are against us.
645;00:42:22,500;00:42:25,539;None of you have seen
645;00:42:22,500;00:42:25,539;the Army of the Dead.
645;00:42:22,500;00:42:25,539;None of you.
646;00:42:25,540;00:42:29,579;We can never hope
646;00:42:25,540;00:42:29,579;to defeat them alone.
647;00:42:29,580;00:42:32,580;We need allies, powerful allies.
648;00:42:35,420;00:42:37,420;I know it's a risk.
649;00:42:39,210;00:42:40,625;But I have to take it.
650;00:42:40,626;00:42:43,369;Then send an emissary.
650;00:42:40,626;00:42:43,369;Don't go yourself.
651;00:42:43,370;00:42:44,910;Daenerys is a queen.
652;00:42:44,920;00:42:47,249;Only a king can
652;00:42:44,920;00:42:47,249;convince her to help us.
653;00:42:47,250;00:42:49,039;It has to be me.
654;00:42:49,040;00:42:50,999;You're abandoning your people!
655;00:42:51,000;00:42:52,789;You're abandoning your home.
656;00:42:52,790;00:42:54,709;I'm leaving both in good hands.
657;00:42:54,710;00:42:56,130;Whose?
657;00:42:54,710;00:42:56,130;Yours.
658;00:42:58,170;00:42:59,619;You are my sister.
659;00:42:59,620;00:43:01,700;You're the only Stark
659;00:42:59,620;00:43:01,700;in Winterfell.

660;00:43:01,710;00:43:05,630;the North is yours.

661;00:43:28,830;00:43:30,740;I delivered his bones myself.
662;00:43:32,290;00:43:33,919;Presented them to Lady Catelyn
663;00:43:33,920;00:43:36,420;as a gesture of goodwill
663;00:43:33,920;00:43:36,420;from Tyrion Lannister.
664;00:43:37,750;00:43:39,250;Seems like a lifetime ago.
665;00:43:40,960;00:43:43,590;Do give Lord Tyrion my best
665;00:43:40,960;00:43:43,590;when you see him.
666;00:43:47,000;00:43:48,959;I was sorry when he died.

667;00:43:48,960;00:43:52,670;had our differences,
667;00:43:48,960;00:43:52,670;but he loved Cat very much.
668;00:43:55,330;00:43:56,880;So did I.
669;00:43:59,170;00:44:01,330;She wasn't fond of you, was she?
670;00:44:03,250;00:44:06,290;Well, it appears she vastly
670;00:44:03,250;00:44:06,290;underestimated you.

675;00:44:24,040;00:44:25,460;Forgive me.

677;00:44:30,710;00:44:32,210;I wanted to remedy that.
