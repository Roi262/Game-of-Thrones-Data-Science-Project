1;00:03:55,740;00:03:57,441;What are they doing
﻿1;00:03:55,740;00:03:57,441;with the bodies?
2;00:03:57,492;00:03:58,637;Get back to work.
3;00:03:59,097;00:04:01,715;No. I've been here
3;00:03:59,097;00:04:01,715;for weeks.
4;00:04:01,717;00:04:03,217;I'm not scrubbing
4;00:04:01,717;00:04:03,217;one more corpse
5;00:04:03,268;00:04:05,786;until you tell me
5;00:04:03,268;00:04:05,786;why I'm doing it.
6;00:04:05,820;00:04:07,721;You will know why.
7;00:04:07,789;00:04:12,026;When?
7;00:04:07,789;00:04:12,026;When it's time, not before.
8;00:04:12,060;00:04:13,527;Get back to work.
9;00:04:13,561;00:04:15,029;When do I get to play the game?
10;00:04:15,063;00:04:16,697;Game?
11;00:04:16,731;00:04:19,316;The game.
11;00:04:16,731;00:04:19,316;The Game of Faces.
12;00:04:19,351;00:04:22,736;You tried already.
12;00:04:19,351;00:04:22,736;You failed.
13;00:04:22,787;00:04:24,204;I didn't even know
13;00:04:22,787;00:04:24,204;I was playing.
14;00:04:24,239;00:04:26,623;Who are you?
15;00:04:26,658;00:04:28,308;No one.
16;00:04:29,577;00:04:30,828;Get back to work.
17;00:04:30,879;00:04:32,329;Who are you?
18;00:04:32,414;00:04:35,582;What are you doing here?
18;00:04:32,414;00:04:35,582;How did you get here?
19;00:04:36,801;00:04:40,154;I'm from Westeros just like you.
20;00:04:41,356;00:04:43,907;Daughter of a lord
20;00:04:41,356;00:04:43,907;just like you.
21;00:04:45,010;00:04:46,744;Except I was an only child.
22;00:04:46,778;00:04:49,997;Heir to his fortune.
23;00:04:50,031;00:04:52,599;My mother died.
24;00:04:52,601;00:04:54,852;My father remarried
24;00:04:52,601;00:04:54,852;and his new wife
25;00:04:54,936;00:04:57,755;gave birth to a girl.
26;00:04:57,789;00:05:02,342;My stepmother didn't want any
26;00:04:57,789;00:05:02,342;rivals for her precious daughter,
27;00:05:02,410;00:05:04,411;so she tried
27;00:05:02,410;00:05:04,411;to kill me with poison.
28;00:05:04,446;00:05:06,680;I found out.
29;00:05:06,715;00:05:08,949;Sought help from
29;00:05:06,715;00:05:08,949;the Faceless Men.
30;00:05:11,152;00:05:13,837;And my father was widowed again.
31;00:05:15,507;00:05:17,875;I've been serving them
31;00:05:15,507;00:05:17,875;ever since.
32;00:05:29,087;00:05:32,372;Was that true or a lie?
33;00:05:35,076;00:05:36,527;What?
34;00:05:36,561;00:05:38,362;Did you believe
34;00:05:36,561;00:05:38,362;every word I said?
35;00:05:43,201;00:05:44,785;Get back to work.
36;00:05:59,384;00:06:01,435;Who are you?
37;00:06:10,979;00:06:13,013;Who are you?
38;00:06:17,986;00:06:19,436;Arya.
39;00:06:20,605;00:06:22,739;And where did you come from?
40;00:06:22,824;00:06:24,241;Westeros.
41;00:06:28,379;00:06:30,364;My family home is Winterfell.
42;00:06:30,366;00:06:33,000;I'm the youngest daughter
42;00:06:30,366;00:06:33,000;of a great lord,
43;00:06:33,034;00:06:34,234;Eddard Stark.
44;00:06:34,285;00:06:35,869;He died in battle.
45;00:06:37,005;00:06:38,539;A lie.
46;00:06:38,590;00:06:41,642;After he was executed,
46;00:06:38,590;00:06:41,642;I fled the capital.
47;00:06:43,011;00:06:44,878;Had to kill a stable boy.
48;00:06:44,929;00:06:46,713;Drove my sword through his back.
49;00:06:48,216;00:06:49,850;A lie.
50;00:06:49,884;00:06:51,802;I stabbed him in the gut.
51;00:06:51,836;00:06:54,371;I tried to find
51;00:06:51,836;00:06:54,371;my mother and brother,
52;00:06:54,405;00:06:56,039;but I never did.
53;00:06:56,107;00:06:58,475;They were murdered
53;00:06:56,107;00:06:58,475;by Walder Frey.
54;00:06:59,894;00:07:02,112;An outlaw kidnapped me,
54;00:06:59,894;00:07:02,112;a man called Polliver.
55;00:07:04,066;00:07:07,568;A man called the Hound.
55;00:07:04,066;00:07:07,568;Sandor Clegane.
56;00:07:07,570;00:07:09,703;He tried to sell me,
56;00:07:07,570;00:07:09,703;but was wounded in a fight.
57;00:07:09,737;00:07:11,738;He begged me to kill him,
57;00:07:09,737;00:07:11,738;but I wouldn't.
58;00:07:11,773;00:07:13,874;I left him
58;00:07:11,773;00:07:13,874;in the mountains to die.
59;00:07:13,908;00:07:16,376;I wanted him to suffer.
59;00:07:13,908;00:07:16,376;I hated him.
60;00:07:18,496;00:07:19,963;I hated him.
61;00:07:21,633;00:07:24,418;That's not a lie!
62;00:07:24,420;00:07:27,421;A girl lies to me,
63;00:07:27,472;00:07:30,924;to the Many-Faced God,
63;00:07:27,472;00:07:30,924;to herself.
64;00:07:30,926;00:07:33,110;Does she truly
64;00:07:30,926;00:07:33,110;want to be no one?
65;00:07:33,178;00:07:35,345;Yes.
66;00:07:40,401;00:07:43,353;I'm not playing
66;00:07:40,401;00:07:43,353;this stupid game anymore!
67;00:07:43,404;00:07:45,572;We never stop playing.
68;00:08:07,845;00:08:11,465;So, those villages
68;00:08:07,845;00:08:11,465;we were supposed to find?
69;00:08:11,516;00:08:13,350;We can't live on
69;00:08:11,516;00:08:13,350;berries and roots.
70;00:08:13,384;00:08:16,103;I can.
71;00:08:16,137;00:08:17,938;You're not hungry?
72;00:08:17,972;00:08:20,224;Of course I'm hungry.
73;00:08:20,308;00:08:22,809;You're an awful travelling
73;00:08:20,308;00:08:22,809;companion, do you know that?
74;00:08:22,811;00:08:25,062;Possibly the least
74;00:08:22,811;00:08:25,062;charming man I've ever met.
75;00:08:25,113;00:08:26,747;I'm not your travelling
75;00:08:25,113;00:08:26,747;companion.
76;00:08:26,781;00:08:30,067;We are travelling together in
76;00:08:26,781;00:08:30,067;each other's company, therefore--
77;00:08:30,151;00:08:31,985;Do you ever shut up?
78;00:08:32,036;00:08:35,155;I sailed from King's Landing
78;00:08:32,036;00:08:35,155;to Pentos in a crate
79;00:08:35,206;00:08:37,658;without ever saying a word.
80;00:08:37,709;00:08:39,409;Why?
81;00:08:42,497;00:08:45,499;It never occurred to you
81;00:08:42,497;00:08:45,499;to ask why until now?
82;00:08:47,835;00:08:49,803;You never wondered
82;00:08:47,835;00:08:49,803;why Tyrion Lannister
83;00:08:49,837;00:08:52,506;decided to visit
83;00:08:49,837;00:08:52,506;a brothel in Volantis?
84;00:08:52,557;00:08:55,509;I'm sure you visited many
84;00:08:52,557;00:08:55,509;brothels in many cities.
85;00:08:57,645;00:08:59,346;I killed my father.
86;00:09:01,899;00:09:05,235;He wanted to execute me
86;00:09:01,899;00:09:05,235;for a crime I didn't commit.
87;00:09:07,855;00:09:10,107;And he was fucking
87;00:09:07,855;00:09:10,107;the woman I loved.
88;00:09:20,752;00:09:22,302;As miserable
88;00:09:20,752;00:09:22,302;as you are, Mormont,
89;00:09:22,337;00:09:23,870;at least your father
89;00:09:22,337;00:09:23,870;was a good man.
90;00:09:23,872;00:09:25,706;What do you know
90;00:09:23,872;00:09:25,706;about my father?
91;00:09:25,740;00:09:29,293;I met him.
91;00:09:25,740;00:09:29,293;I visited the Wall.
92;00:09:29,344;00:09:32,262;When I asked him about his men,
93;00:09:32,297;00:09:34,538;he knew all their stories,
93;00:09:32,297;00:09:34,538;every one of them.
94;00:09:34,549;00:09:38,135;He actually cared about the
94;00:09:34,549;00:09:38,135;people under his command.
95;00:09:38,219;00:09:41,555;How do they put it in the Watch?
96;00:09:41,606;00:09:44,358;We shall never see
96;00:09:41,606;00:09:44,358;his like again.
97;00:09:54,035;00:09:57,537;Oh, you didn't know.
98;00:10:02,910;00:10:05,912;I'm sorry.
98;00:10:02,910;00:10:05,912;I am.
99;00:10:08,249;00:10:09,750;How?
100;00:10:11,252;00:10:13,086;I only know what I heard.
101;00:10:13,137;00:10:14,304;How?
102;00:10:14,389;00:10:16,923;He was leading an
102;00:10:14,389;00:10:16,923;expedition beyond the Wall.
103;00:10:17,842;00:10:20,510;There was a mutiny.
104;00:10:20,561;00:10:22,829;He was murdered by his own men.
105;00:10:34,442;00:10:36,693;We better keep moving.
106;00:11:26,160;00:11:27,711;Valar morghulis.
107;00:11:27,779;00:11:29,846;Valar dohaeris.
108;00:11:31,282;00:11:33,583;I have nowhere else to go.
109;00:11:33,618;00:11:37,287;I've taken her to every
109;00:11:33,618;00:11:37,287;healer in Braavos.
110;00:11:37,321;00:11:40,323;I've spent every penny I had.
111;00:11:45,430;00:11:48,465;She suffers every day
111;00:11:45,430;00:11:48,465;of her life.
112;00:11:48,499;00:11:51,485;I just want it to end.
113;00:12:19,380;00:12:21,047;It hurts.
114;00:12:21,098;00:12:23,467;I know.
115;00:12:25,603;00:12:28,054;Don't be afraid.
116;00:12:28,105;00:12:31,508;I used to be like you.
117;00:12:31,542;00:12:33,677;I was sick.
118;00:12:34,946;00:12:36,947;I was dying.
119;00:12:39,800;00:12:43,487;But my father
119;00:12:39,800;00:12:43,487;never gave up on me.
120;00:12:45,907;00:12:48,692;He loved me
121;00:12:48,726;00:12:50,327;more than anything in the world,
122;00:12:50,378;00:12:53,113;just like your father loves you.
123;00:12:53,147;00:12:56,399;So he brought me here.
124;00:12:56,434;00:12:59,085;My father prayed
124;00:12:56,434;00:12:59,085;to the Many-Faced God.
125;00:13:01,222;00:13:03,423;And I drank the water
125;00:13:01,222;00:13:03,423;from his fountain.
126;00:13:04,642;00:13:06,493;It healed me.
127;00:13:19,106;00:13:21,691;I've devoted my life to him now.
128;00:13:23,211;00:13:25,372;You don't want to hurt anymore?
129;00:13:27,465;00:13:29,165;Drink.
130;00:16:13,497;00:16:15,448;Is a girl ready?
131;00:16:17,118;00:16:20,003;To give up her ears,
131;00:16:17,118;00:16:20,003;her nose, her tongue?
132;00:16:21,589;00:16:24,457;Her hopes and dreams,
132;00:16:21,589;00:16:24,457;her loves and hates?
133;00:16:24,508;00:16:27,293;All that makes a girl
133;00:16:24,508;00:16:27,293;who she is?
134;00:16:28,429;00:16:30,597;Forever?
135;00:16:33,718;00:16:36,136;No.
136;00:16:36,138;00:16:39,305;A girl is not ready
136;00:16:36,138;00:16:39,305;to become no one.
137;00:16:44,795;00:16:47,464;But she is ready
137;00:16:44,795;00:16:47,464;to become someone else.
138;00:17:00,745;00:17:03,797;Why Daenerys? Why is
138;00:17:00,745;00:17:03,797;she worth all this?
139;00:17:05,499;00:17:08,635;As I recall, the Mormonts
139;00:17:05,499;00:17:08,635;fought against the Targaryens
140;00:17:08,669;00:17:10,553;during Robert's Rebellion.
141;00:17:10,588;00:17:12,722;Do you believe in anything?
142;00:17:12,757;00:17:14,424;I believe in lots of things.
143;00:17:14,508;00:17:16,392;In something greater
143;00:17:14,508;00:17:16,392;than ourselves, I mean.
144;00:17:16,427;00:17:18,511;The gods, destiny.
145;00:17:18,562;00:17:21,765;Do you believe there's
145;00:17:18,562;00:17:21,765;a plan for this world?
146;00:17:21,849;00:17:24,267;No.
147;00:17:24,318;00:17:25,568;Neither did I.
148;00:17:25,603;00:17:27,987;I was a cynic just like you.
149;00:17:28,022;00:17:31,157;Then I saw a girl
149;00:17:28,022;00:17:31,157;step into a great fire
150;00:17:31,192;00:17:33,076;with three stone eggs.
151;00:17:33,110;00:17:35,912;When the fire burned out, I thought
151;00:17:33,110;00:17:35,912;I'd find her blackened bones.
152;00:17:35,946;00:17:40,033;Instead, I saw her, Daenerys,
153;00:17:40,084;00:17:44,087;alive and unhurt,
153;00:17:40,084;00:17:44,087;holding her baby dragons.
154;00:17:46,423;00:17:49,209;Have you ever heard
154;00:17:46,423;00:17:49,209;baby dragons singing?
155;00:17:49,260;00:17:50,960;No.
156;00:17:51,011;00:17:53,463;It's hard to be
156;00:17:51,011;00:17:53,463;a cynic after that.
157;00:17:55,382;00:17:57,634;Doesn't mean she's going
157;00:17:55,382;00:17:57,634;to be a great queen.
158;00:17:57,685;00:17:59,552;No, it doesn't.
159;00:17:59,603;00:18:01,888;The Targaryens
159;00:17:59,603;00:18:01,888;are famously insane.
160;00:18:01,890;00:18:04,808;What if she conquers the world?
160;00:18:01,890;00:18:04,808;Then what?
161;00:18:04,859;00:18:07,110;1,000 years of peace
161;00:18:04,859;00:18:07,110;and prosperity?
162;00:18:07,144;00:18:09,145;First we have
162;00:18:07,144;00:18:09,145;to conquer the world.
163;00:18:09,196;00:18:11,064;We?
164;00:18:11,066;00:18:13,283;All right, let's assume
164;00:18:11,066;00:18:13,283;your dreams come true.
165;00:18:13,367;00:18:16,653;She's ecstatic when you
165;00:18:13,367;00:18:16,653;bring her this enemy dwarf.
166;00:18:16,704;00:18:19,873;She hacks off my head
166;00:18:16,704;00:18:19,873;and restores your position.
167;00:18:19,907;00:18:22,208;You command her army,
167;00:18:19,907;00:18:22,208;sail to Westeros,
168;00:18:22,243;00:18:25,161;defeat all your enemies and
168;00:18:22,243;00:18:25,161;watch her climb those steps
169;00:18:25,212;00:18:26,663;and sit on the Iron Throne.
170;00:18:26,714;00:18:28,965;Hurrah. Long live the queen.
170;00:18:26,714;00:18:28,965;Then what?
171;00:18:28,999;00:18:30,583;Then she rules.
172;00:18:30,634;00:18:33,803;So a woman who has not spent a
172;00:18:30,634;00:18:33,803;single day of her adult life
173;00:18:33,838;00:18:36,556;in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros?
173;00:18:33,838;00:18:36,556;That's justice?
174;00:18:36,590;00:18:39,142;She's the rightful heir.
174;00:18:36,590;00:18:39,142;Why?
175;00:18:39,176;00:18:43,012;Because her father, who burned living
175;00:18:39,176;00:18:43,012;men for amusement, was the king?
176;00:18:46,400;00:18:48,685;That's a slave ship.
176;00:18:46,400;00:18:48,685;Why are they anchored?
177;00:18:48,736;00:18:50,520;They probably
177;00:18:48,736;00:18:50,520;came ashore for--
178;00:18:50,571;00:18:53,022;Water.
179;00:19:03,617;00:19:06,369;Got a lot of fight in you, huh?
180;00:19:14,628;00:19:16,679;Salt mines?
181;00:19:16,764;00:19:20,016;Yeah, that or a galley slave.
182;00:19:20,050;00:19:21,935;He looks strong enough.
183;00:19:21,969;00:19:24,771;What about the dwarf?
184;00:19:24,805;00:19:27,106;Worthless.
185;00:19:27,141;00:19:29,726;Cut his throat.
186;00:19:29,777;00:19:31,778;Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
186;00:19:29,777;00:19:31,778;Let's discuss this.
187;00:19:31,812;00:19:34,230;And then chop off his cock.
188;00:19:34,315;00:19:35,481;We'll sell it for a fortune.
189;00:19:35,532;00:19:37,650;A dwarf's cock has magic powers.
190;00:19:37,701;00:19:40,069;Wait! Wait!
191;00:19:40,120;00:19:41,487;Wait, wait, wait!
192;00:19:41,489;00:19:44,123;You can't just hand
192;00:19:41,489;00:19:44,123;a dry cock to a merchant
193;00:19:44,158;00:19:45,658;and expect him to pay for it.
194;00:19:45,660;00:19:47,660;He has to know
194;00:19:45,660;00:19:47,660;it came from a dwarf.
195;00:19:47,711;00:19:51,014;And how could he know
195;00:19:47,711;00:19:51,014;unless he sees the dwarf?
196;00:19:51,048;00:19:52,799;It will be
196;00:19:51,048;00:19:52,799;a dwarf-sized cock.
197;00:19:52,833;00:19:54,834;Guess again.
198;00:19:59,673;00:20:02,759;The dwarf lives until we
198;00:19:59,673;00:20:02,759;find a cock merchant.
199;00:20:11,435;00:20:13,937;Queen Daenerys
199;00:20:11,435;00:20:13,937;has outlawed slavery.
200;00:20:13,988;00:20:17,023;We're bound for Volantis,
200;00:20:13,988;00:20:17,023;not Slaver's Bay.
201;00:20:17,025;00:20:20,743;Besides, she reopened
201;00:20:17,025;00:20:20,743;the fighting pits.
202;00:20:20,778;00:20:23,446;I've never heard of free men
202;00:20:20,778;00:20:23,446;fighting in the pits.
203;00:20:23,497;00:20:25,698;The fighting
203;00:20:23,497;00:20:25,698;pits in Meereen?
204;00:20:25,700;00:20:28,701;You're in luck, then.
204;00:20:25,700;00:20:28,701;You're about to be rich.
205;00:20:28,703;00:20:32,672;You are looking at one of the great
205;00:20:28,703;00:20:32,672;warriors in the Seven Kingdoms.
206;00:20:34,375;00:20:35,959;Him.
207;00:20:36,010;00:20:39,929;Him? He's got to
207;00:20:36,010;00:20:39,929;be 60 years old.
208;00:20:39,964;00:20:42,682;Sure, he's a bit
208;00:20:39,964;00:20:42,682;long in the tooth,
209;00:20:42,716;00:20:45,518;a bit withered,
209;00:20:42,716;00:20:45,518;been in the sun too long.
210;00:20:45,552;00:20:49,022;We can all see that. But he
210;00:20:45,552;00:20:49,022;is a veteran of 100 battles.
211;00:20:49,056;00:20:51,357;They wrote songs about him.
212;00:20:57,531;00:20:59,282;That true?
213;00:21:04,571;00:21:07,457;He won the tournament
213;00:21:04,571;00:21:07,457;at Lannisport.
214;00:21:07,491;00:21:10,126;Unseating Ser Jaime
214;00:21:07,491;00:21:10,126;Lannister himself.
215;00:21:11,378;00:21:14,414;The Kingslayer.
216;00:21:14,416;00:21:17,834;Jousting. You're talking
216;00:21:14,416;00:21:17,834;about jousting.
217;00:21:17,885;00:21:20,219;A fancy game for fancy lads.
218;00:21:20,254;00:21:23,006;The men who fight in the pits of
218;00:21:20,254;00:21:23,006;Meereen will swallow him whole.
219;00:21:23,057;00:21:26,097;I killed a Dothraki
219;00:21:23,057;00:21:26,097;bloodrider in single combat.
220;00:21:36,603;00:21:38,021;Liar.
221;00:21:38,072;00:21:40,740;It's no lie.
221;00:21:38,072;00:21:40,740;His name was Qotho.
222;00:21:40,774;00:21:43,659;He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo.
223;00:21:43,694;00:21:47,663;Take me to Slaver's Bay,
223;00:21:43,694;00:21:47,663;put a sword in my hand,
224;00:21:47,698;00:21:49,332;I'll prove my worth.
225;00:22:01,045;00:22:04,263;For my children.
225;00:22:01,045;00:22:04,263;Money.
226;00:22:07,885;00:22:09,936;Lord Baelish.
227;00:22:09,970;00:22:12,105;Yes?
228;00:22:13,440;00:22:15,475;Lancel Lannister.
229;00:22:17,644;00:22:19,612;Brother Lancel.
230;00:22:19,646;00:22:21,230;We abandon our family names.
231;00:22:21,281;00:22:23,066;Quite a family to abandon.
232;00:22:23,117;00:22:26,285;The city has changed
232;00:22:23,117;00:22:26,285;since you were here last.
233;00:22:26,320;00:22:28,204;We flooded the gutters
233;00:22:26,320;00:22:28,204;with wine,
234;00:22:28,238;00:22:30,706;smashed the false idols,
235;00:22:30,741;00:22:33,242;and set the godless on the run.
236;00:22:33,293;00:22:34,794;Well done.
237;00:22:40,250;00:22:43,469;I'm here on urgent business
237;00:22:40,250;00:22:43,469;for the Queen Mother.
238;00:22:43,504;00:22:46,472;Should I send word
238;00:22:43,504;00:22:46,472;that I'll be delayed?
239;00:22:50,227;00:22:51,894;Step carefully, Lord Baelish.
240;00:22:51,929;00:22:54,347;You'll find there's little
240;00:22:51,929;00:22:54,347;tolerance for flesh peddlers
241;00:22:54,398;00:22:55,932;in the new King's Landing.
242;00:22:55,983;00:22:58,818;We both peddle fantasies,
242;00:22:55,983;00:22:58,818;Brother Lancel.
243;00:22:58,852;00:23:01,354;Mine just happen
243;00:22:58,852;00:23:01,354;to be entertaining.
244;00:23:10,664;00:23:14,000;Do you think it's wise,
244;00:23:10,664;00:23:14,000;Your Grace,
245;00:23:14,034;00:23:15,835;arresting the heir
245;00:23:14,034;00:23:15,835;to Highgarden?
246;00:23:15,869;00:23:18,704;The Faith arrested
246;00:23:15,869;00:23:18,704;the heir to Highgarden.
247;00:23:18,706;00:23:21,867;Of course, and the Faith
247;00:23:18,706;00:23:21,867;were armed on your orders.
248;00:23:21,875;00:23:23,676;The king's orders.
249;00:23:23,710;00:23:25,795;Is the king to blame
249;00:23:23,710;00:23:25,795;for Ser Loras's perversion?
250;00:23:25,879;00:23:27,747;House Tyrell won't
250;00:23:25,879;00:23:27,747;tolerate this insult.
251;00:23:27,781;00:23:30,883;House Tyrell won't tolerate it?
252;00:23:30,934;00:23:32,885;I'm the insulted party,
252;00:23:30,934;00:23:32,885;Lord Baelish.
253;00:23:32,920;00:23:34,754;Ser Loras was promised to me.
254;00:23:34,788;00:23:36,772;Instead he chose
254;00:23:34,788;00:23:36,772;the company of boys.
255;00:23:36,807;00:23:39,127;One's choice of companion
255;00:23:36,807;00:23:39,127;is a curious thing.
256;00:23:41,829;00:23:43,396;Most curious.
257;00:23:45,566;00:23:47,733;Lysa Arryn, for instance.
258;00:23:47,735;00:23:49,769;Thoroughly repellant woman.
259;00:23:51,171;00:23:53,122;Forgive me.
260;00:23:53,157;00:23:55,124;I know you're still in mourning.
261;00:23:55,159;00:23:58,544;Lysa was a good woman.
262;00:23:58,579;00:23:59,879;A kind woman.
263;00:23:59,913;00:24:02,882;She was neither of those things.
263;00:23:59,913;00:24:02,882;We both know it.
264;00:24:02,916;00:24:04,917;Still, I pity her son.
265;00:24:04,952;00:24:07,220;How fortunate the young
265;00:24:04,952;00:24:07,220;Lord of the Vale
266;00:24:07,254;00:24:09,555;has a new father to counsel him.
267;00:24:09,590;00:24:11,591;I know how hard it can be
268;00:24:11,593;00:24:14,427;to lose both your parents
268;00:24:11,593;00:24:14,427;at such a young age.
269;00:24:14,429;00:24:17,429;If war comes to Westeros, will the Knights
269;00:24:14,429;00:24:17,429;of the Vale fight for their king?
270;00:24:18,515;00:24:20,850;Young Lord Robin
270;00:24:18,515;00:24:20,850;heeds my advice.
271;00:24:22,402;00:24:24,804;And I have always counseled
271;00:24:22,402;00:24:24,804;loyalty to the throne.
272;00:24:24,838;00:24:26,639;Good.
273;00:24:30,944;00:24:32,828;If there's nothing else.
274;00:24:33,947;00:24:35,781;There is another matter,
274;00:24:33,947;00:24:35,781;Your Grace.
275;00:24:35,832;00:24:38,534;Something so urgent I couldn't
275;00:24:35,832;00:24:38,534;trust the words to a raven.
276;00:24:38,619;00:24:41,470;You once charged me
276;00:24:38,619;00:24:41,470;with finding Arya Stark.
277;00:24:41,505;00:24:44,423;To my shame, I failed you.
278;00:24:44,458;00:24:46,759;But I have found Sansa Stark.

280;00:24:51,715;00:24:53,182;living at Winterfell.
281;00:24:53,217;00:24:55,468;That's not possible.
282;00:24:55,519;00:24:57,853;My sources are well placed.

285;00:25:03,610;00:25:06,279;a bastard recently
285;00:25:03,610;00:25:06,279;legitimized by King Tommen.
286;00:25:06,313;00:25:10,283;Roose Bolton is Warden of the
286;00:25:06,313;00:25:10,283;North by the grace of my father.
287;00:25:10,317;00:25:14,287;Indeed, his reward for stabbing
287;00:25:10,317;00:25:14,287;his own king in the heart.
288;00:25:15,572;00:25:17,707;We were fools
288;00:25:15,572;00:25:17,707;to trust a turncloak.

290;00:25:20,161;00:25:22,078;in the North
291;00:25:22,129;00:25:24,046;than an alliance with
291;00:25:22,129;00:25:24,046;a hated southern house.
292;00:25:24,081;00:25:27,466;I will skin him and his bastard
293;00:25:27,501;00:25:29,335;like that wretch
293;00:25:27,501;00:25:29,335;on their bloody sigil.
294;00:25:29,337;00:25:31,170;I would counsel

296;00:25:33,090;00:25:34,640;Sansa helped murder my son.
297;00:25:34,675;00:25:36,225;Roose Bolton is a traitor.

299;00:25:38,312;00:25:39,879;on Winterfell.
300;00:25:39,913;00:25:42,398;Let Stannis and Roose battle.
301;00:25:42,432;00:25:45,067;Let the enemies of the

302;00:25:45,102;00:25:48,471;And when they're done, seize Winterfell
302;00:25:45,102;00:25:48,471;from whichever thief survives.

305;00:25:53,194;00:25:56,128;to strike soon
306;00:25:56,163;00:25:58,581;while the victor
306;00:25:56,163;00:25:58,581;still licks his wounds.
307;00:26:00,367;00:26:02,668;Surely your Uncle Kevan
307;00:26:00,367;00:26:02,668;could muster a force.

312;00:26:13,096;00:26:15,548;Perhaps I can help.

315;00:26:21,021;00:26:23,889;Forgive me, Lord Baelish,
316;00:26:23,940;00:26:26,142;you have a reputation
316;00:26:23,940;00:26:26,142;as a moneylender
317;00:26:26,193;00:26:28,728;and a brothel keeper,
317;00:26:26,193;00:26:28,728;not a military man.
318;00:26:28,779;00:26:30,913;You wouldn't risk
318;00:26:28,779;00:26:30,913;a single Lannister soldier

319;00:26:30,947;00:26:34,367;from the royal treasury.
320;00:26:34,401;00:26:36,118;What do you have to lose?
321;00:26:36,153;00:26:38,020;A brothel keeper?
322;00:26:38,055;00:26:39,572;And if you succeed?
323;00:26:39,574;00:26:41,741;Name me Warden of the North.
324;00:26:46,163;00:26:49,632;I'll speak to the king

325;00:26:49,666;00:26:51,834;have him issue a royal decree.
326;00:26:51,868;00:26:54,720;I'll not rest until the

328;00:26:57,074;00:27:00,092;when I see Sansa Stark's
328;00:26:57,074;00:27:00,092;head on a spike.
329;00:27:00,143;00:27:02,228;As I said...
330;00:27:02,262;00:27:04,213;I live to serve.
331;00:27:09,686;00:27:12,855;I'm going to ask him tomorrow.
332;00:27:14,441;00:27:16,158;What if he says no?
332;00:27:14,441;00:27:16,158;He won't.
333;00:27:16,243;00:27:18,611;We've waited long enough.
334;00:27:18,662;00:27:20,863;I want you to be my wife.
335;00:27:20,914;00:27:22,948;Now.
336;00:27:24,251;00:27:25,868;What is it?
337;00:27:25,902;00:27:28,838;Do you want to marry me because
337;00:27:25,902;00:27:28,838;our families arranged it?
338;00:27:28,872;00:27:30,756;Or do you--
339;00:27:38,181;00:27:40,800;We can't.
339;00:27:38,181;00:27:40,800;Not yet.
340;00:27:40,802;00:27:42,017;Why not?
341;00:27:42,052;00:27:44,103;You know why not.
341;00:27:42,052;00:27:44,103;Someone will see.
342;00:27:44,137;00:27:46,472;You are going to be my wife.
343;00:27:46,523;00:27:50,559;I am going to be your husband.
344;00:27:50,610;00:27:54,146;We're allowed to walk through

347;00:28:01,488;00:28:05,040;didn't answer the question.

412;00:34:19,859;00:34:21,643;is the queen's brother.
413;00:34:21,645;00:34:24,112;No, no, no, no.
413;00:34:21,645;00:34:24,112;This is unacceptable.
414;00:34:24,146;00:34:26,226;Cersei's behind it.
414;00:34:24,146;00:34:26,226;Yeah, of course she is.
415;00:34:26,232;00:34:28,650;She wants to drag our
415;00:34:26,232;00:34:28,650;name through the dirt,
416;00:34:28,701;00:34:30,535;put us in our place.
417;00:34:30,569;00:34:32,654;Get some rest, dear.
417;00:34:30,569;00:34:32,654;You look appalling.
418;00:34:32,705;00:34:34,873;Let me deal
418;00:34:32,705;00:34:34,873;with Cersei Lannister.
419;00:34:40,913;00:34:44,382;Your Grace, I have
419;00:34:40,913;00:34:44,382;travelled a long way.
420;00:34:44,417;00:34:46,885;You must be exhausted.
421;00:34:49,221;00:34:52,057;Put the pen down, dear. We both
421;00:34:49,221;00:34:52,057;know you're not writing anything.
422;00:34:52,091;00:34:55,427;Ah, yes. The famously
422;00:34:52,091;00:34:55,427;tart-tongued Queen of Thorns.
423;00:34:55,494;00:34:58,480;And the famous tart
423;00:34:55,494;00:34:58,480;Queen Cersei.
424;00:35:02,184;00:35:03,768;I beg your pardon?
425;00:35:03,819;00:35:07,405;I know you're behind this absurd
425;00:35:03,819;00:35:07,405;incarceration of my grandson.
426;00:35:07,440;00:35:10,275;If you apologize for that
426;00:35:07,440;00:35:10,275;comment, perhaps I'll--
427;00:35:10,326;00:35:13,194;You'll get your apology
427;00:35:10,326;00:35:13,194;when I get Loras.
428;00:35:14,413;00:35:16,281;I was as shocked as anyone
429;00:35:16,332;00:35:18,950;when the Faith
429;00:35:16,332;00:35:18,950;arrested Ser Loras.
430;00:35:19,001;00:35:21,586;I have no love
430;00:35:19,001;00:35:21,586;for these fanatics,
431;00:35:21,620;00:35:24,222;but what can a Queen Mother do?
432;00:35:25,541;00:35:27,459;Has the crown
432;00:35:25,541;00:35:27,459;suddenly stopped needing
433;00:35:27,510;00:35:30,762;the troops, gold, and
433;00:35:27,510;00:35:30,762;wheat my house supplies?
434;00:35:30,846;00:35:32,847;I can assure you,
435;00:35:32,882;00:35:34,883;our alliance with
435;00:35:32,882;00:35:34,883;House Tyrell remains--
436;00:35:34,934;00:35:36,551;Do you expect
436;00:35:34,934;00:35:36,551;the alliance to continue
437;00:35:36,602;00:35:39,304;after you've thrown
437;00:35:36,602;00:35:39,304;our future into prison?
438;00:35:39,388;00:35:41,690;As I said,
439;00:35:41,724;00:35:44,175;I didn't imprison anyone.
440;00:35:44,210;00:35:45,610;As for your
440;00:35:44,210;00:35:45,610;veiled threats--
441;00:35:45,644;00:35:47,095;What veil?
442;00:35:49,448;00:35:53,952;The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought
442;00:35:49,448;00:35:53,952;peace to a war-torn country.
443;00:35:54,019;00:35:57,238;Do you really want to see the Seven
443;00:35:54,019;00:35:57,238;Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
444;00:36:00,376;00:36:01,910;I didn't trust your father.
445;00:36:01,961;00:36:04,579;I didn't particularly like him.
446;00:36:04,581;00:36:08,133;But I respected him.
446;00:36:04,581;00:36:08,133;He was no fool.
447;00:36:08,167;00:36:11,886;He understood that sometimes
447;00:36:08,167;00:36:11,886;we must work with our rivals
448;00:36:11,921;00:36:13,471;rather than destroy them.
449;00:36:13,506;00:36:15,724;House Lannister has no rival.
450;00:36:18,144;00:36:21,629;The High Septon has called
450;00:36:18,144;00:36:21,629;for an inquest, not a trial.
451;00:36:21,664;00:36:23,348;Just a small hearing
451;00:36:21,664;00:36:23,348;to determine
452;00:36:23,399;00:36:26,234;whether the charges
452;00:36:23,399;00:36:26,234;against Loras have merit,
453;00:36:26,268;00:36:28,286;which I'm sure they don't.
454;00:36:28,320;00:36:31,806;Loras will be freed, our happy
454;00:36:28,320;00:36:31,806;alliance will continue...
455;00:36:33,526;00:36:36,444;and we'll forget this unfortunate
455;00:36:33,526;00:36:36,444;conversation ever happened.
456;00:36:38,247;00:36:39,781;Good day, Lady Olenna.
457;00:36:59,435;00:37:02,187;You are aware of the rumors
457;00:36:59,435;00:37:02,187;concerning you and Renly?
458;00:37:03,305;00:37:05,890;I don't pay attention to rumors.
459;00:37:05,941;00:37:09,260;You were said to be
459;00:37:05,941;00:37:09,260;despondent when he died.
460;00:37:09,295;00:37:12,831;Witnesses state that you
460;00:37:09,295;00:37:12,831;refused to leave his bedside
461;00:37:12,865;00:37:15,400;even as Stannis's army
461;00:37:12,865;00:37:15,400;closed in.
462;00:37:15,451;00:37:19,287;He was my friend.
462;00:37:15,451;00:37:19,287;He was my king.
463;00:37:19,321;00:37:21,739;Wasn't Joffrey your king?
464;00:37:21,791;00:37:24,793;He was anointed
464;00:37:21,791;00:37:24,793;by the Seven, not Renly.
465;00:37:24,827;00:37:29,380;I was wrong to support
465;00:37:24,827;00:37:29,380;Renly's claim, I know that.
466;00:37:30,549;00:37:32,967;But I was forgiven by Joffrey.
467;00:37:33,002;00:37:35,470;I fought for him at the
467;00:37:33,002;00:37:35,470;Battle of Blackwater.
468;00:37:35,504;00:37:39,174;Yes, wearing Renly's armor.
469;00:37:39,176;00:37:41,559;Why does it matter what I wore?
470;00:37:41,594;00:37:44,229;Do you deny all
470;00:37:41,594;00:37:44,229;the charges against you?
471;00:37:44,263;00:37:46,314;Fornication.
472;00:37:46,348;00:37:48,516;Buggery.
472;00:37:46,348;00:37:48,516;Blasphemy.
473;00:37:48,518;00:37:50,151;Of course I deny them.
474;00:37:50,186;00:37:52,237;You never lay
474;00:37:50,186;00:37:52,237;with Renly Baratheon?
475;00:37:52,271;00:37:54,222;Never.
476;00:37:54,256;00:37:56,407;Nor any other man?
477;00:37:56,442;00:37:58,059;Never.
478;00:38:00,412;00:38:03,031;That will be all, Ser Loras.
479;00:38:10,206;00:38:12,924;Well, I think that's
479;00:38:10,206;00:38:12,924;quite enough of that.
480;00:38:12,958;00:38:15,543;The Faith calls
480;00:38:12,958;00:38:15,543;Queen Margaery forward.
481;00:38:15,594;00:38:17,545;You call me forward?
482;00:38:17,630;00:38:19,931;Yes, we have some
482;00:38:17,630;00:38:19,931;questions for you.
483;00:38:19,965;00:38:24,068;I am the queen.
483;00:38:19,965;00:38:24,068;You are.
484;00:38:24,103;00:38:26,538;And according
484;00:38:24,103;00:38:26,538;to the law of the Seven,
485;00:38:26,572;00:38:28,973;neither kings
485;00:38:26,572;00:38:28,973;nor queens are exempt
486;00:38:29,024;00:38:31,893;from testimony
486;00:38:29,024;00:38:31,893;at a holy inquest.
487;00:38:49,912;00:38:53,581;How do you respond to these
487;00:38:49,912;00:38:53,581;charges against your brother?
488;00:38:53,583;00:38:55,350;They are lies.
489;00:38:55,384;00:38:57,051;All of them?
489;00:38:55,384;00:38:57,051;All of them.
490;00:38:57,086;00:39:00,038;Queen Margaery,
491;00:39:00,072;00:39:01,589;in the presence of the gods,
492;00:39:01,624;00:39:03,841;do you swear that your
492;00:39:01,624;00:39:03,841;brother is innocent
493;00:39:03,893;00:39:05,760;of these charges against him
494;00:39:05,811;00:39:07,428;to the best of your knowledge?
495;00:39:07,430;00:39:09,514;Yes, I swear it.
496;00:39:10,766;00:39:13,017;Thank you, Your Grace.
497;00:39:38,544;00:39:40,295;Do you know this man?
498;00:39:40,346;00:39:43,848;Yes, very well.
499;00:39:43,882;00:39:46,634;He is Ser Loras Tyrell,
499;00:39:43,882;00:39:46,634;heir to Highgarden.
500;00:39:46,636;00:39:49,304;How did you come to meet?
501;00:39:49,355;00:39:51,973;I squired for him.
502;00:39:52,007;00:39:53,808;He took a liking to me.
503;00:39:53,859;00:39:57,020;He summoned me to his chamber
503;00:39:53,859;00:39:57,020;the first day we met.
504;00:39:58,063;00:40:01,816;And what occurred
504;00:39:58,063;00:40:01,816;in his chamber?
505;00:40:01,818;00:40:06,321;We engaged
505;00:40:01,818;00:40:06,321;in intimate relations.
506;00:40:06,323;00:40:08,156;You lay with him?
507;00:40:08,207;00:40:09,741;That night and many others.
508;00:40:09,792;00:40:12,243;Liar.
508;00:40:09,792;00:40:12,243;He's a liar.
509;00:40:13,796;00:40:15,663;Is there anyone else
509;00:40:13,796;00:40:15,663;who can support your claim?
510;00:40:15,665;00:40:17,966;Yes.
511;00:40:18,000;00:40:20,885;Yes, Queen Margaery.
512;00:40:20,970;00:40:24,305;She walked in on us once
512;00:40:20,970;00:40:24,305;not long ago.
513;00:40:24,340;00:40:27,008;She didn't seem surprised.
514;00:40:27,059;00:40:30,979;This testimony is an insult
514;00:40:27,059;00:40:30,979;to a great house.
515;00:40:31,013;00:40:34,182;Why should the Faith or anyone
515;00:40:31,013;00:40:34,182;else take the word of a squire
516;00:40:34,184;00:40:35,850;over the heir to Highgarden?
517;00:40:35,901;00:40:37,902;He has a
517;00:40:35,901;00:40:37,902;birthmark, Your Grace.
518;00:40:37,987;00:40:40,855;Quite high on his thigh.
519;00:40:40,906;00:40:43,925;Wine-colored and roughly
519;00:40:40,906;00:40:43,925;the shape of Dorne.
520;00:40:43,993;00:40:46,494;No! Liar!
521;00:40:48,280;00:40:52,200;What are you doing?
521;00:40:48,280;00:40:52,200;Let us pass.
522;00:40:52,202;00:40:54,702;The Faith is satisfied
522;00:40:52,202;00:40:54,702;there is enough evidence
523;00:40:54,753;00:40:56,671;to bring a formal trial
524;00:40:56,705;00:40:58,956;for Ser Loras
525;00:40:59,008;00:41:00,792;and Queen Margaery.
526;00:41:00,843;00:41:02,093;What?
527;00:41:02,127;00:41:04,178;Bearing false witness
527;00:41:02,127;00:41:04,178;before the gods
528;00:41:04,213;00:41:06,848;is as grave a sin
528;00:41:04,213;00:41:06,848;as any, my lady.
529;00:41:06,882;00:41:08,599;Take her.
530;00:41:08,684;00:41:11,352;No. Tommen.
531;00:41:11,387;00:41:13,137;Tommen!
532;00:41:14,390;00:41:16,474;You can't do this.
532;00:41:14,390;00:41:16,474;I am the queen.
533;00:41:16,525;00:41:19,193;Tommen!
533;00:41:16,525;00:41:19,193;Tommen!
534;00:41:19,228;00:41:21,729;I am your queen.
534;00:41:19,228;00:41:21,729;How dare you?
535;00:41:21,731;00:41:23,264;Take your hands off me!
536;00:41:23,332;00:41:25,950;Tommen!
537;00:41:49,174;00:41:51,342;What do you want?
538;00:41:51,393;00:41:54,228;Lord Ramsay sent me to
538;00:41:51,393;00:41:54,228;draw you a bath, my lady.
539;00:41:54,263;00:41:56,998;You want to be clean and fresh
540;00:41:57,032;00:41:59,072;for your new husband, don't you?
541;00:42:15,667;00:42:18,286;You're so beautiful,
542;00:42:18,288;00:42:21,339;but you need to keep him happy.
543;00:42:21,373;00:42:25,626;Ramsay gets bored easily.
544;00:42:25,677;00:42:27,795;You don't want
544;00:42:25,677;00:42:27,795;to end up like--
545;00:42:29,765;00:42:32,383;well, like the others.
546;00:42:32,434;00:42:34,769;What others?
547;00:42:34,803;00:42:37,054;I shouldn't gossip.
548;00:42:37,106;00:42:39,690;Oh, it's good to see
548;00:42:37,106;00:42:39,690;the red again.
549;00:42:39,725;00:42:41,726;No point hiding anymore.
550;00:42:41,777;00:42:43,227;What others?
551;00:42:43,278;00:42:45,863;Let's see, there was Kyra
552;00:42:45,898;00:42:47,865;the blacksmith's daughter.
553;00:42:47,950;00:42:50,485;She was tall like you,
553;00:42:47,950;00:42:50,485;lovely figure.
554;00:42:50,536;00:42:54,989;But she talked
554;00:42:50,536;00:42:54,989;and talked and talked
555;00:42:55,040;00:42:58,409;and Ramsay grew tired of that.
556;00:42:58,460;00:43:00,962;Then there was Violet.
557;00:43:00,996;00:43:03,498;She had gorgeous blonde hair.
558;00:43:03,549;00:43:06,501;But she got pregnant.
559;00:43:06,503;00:43:09,420;And, well, that was boring.
560;00:43:09,471;00:43:13,141;Then Tansy.
561;00:43:13,175;00:43:14,809;Such a sweet girl.
562;00:43:14,843;00:43:20,014;Of course, sweet girls
562;00:43:14,843;00:43:20,014;get a bit dull
563;00:43:20,065;00:43:22,150;after a while, don't they?
564;00:43:22,184;00:43:24,485;Ramsay let me come
564;00:43:22,184;00:43:24,485;with him on that hunt.
565;00:43:24,520;00:43:25,653;Hunt?
566;00:43:25,687;00:43:27,522;Mmm.
567;00:43:29,575;00:43:33,861;Have you ever seen a body after
567;00:43:29,575;00:43:33,861;the dogs have been at it?
568;00:43:33,912;00:43:35,780;Not so pretty.
569;00:43:37,749;00:43:40,918;But, well, it's your
569;00:43:37,749;00:43:40,918;wedding day.
570;00:43:41,334;00:43:43,453;Why am I talking
570;00:43:41,334;00:43:43,453;about such things?
571;00:43:45,757;00:43:47,542;What was your name again?
572;00:43:47,593;00:43:49,210;Myranda.
573;00:43:51,430;00:43:54,048;And how long have yo
573;00:43:51,430;00:43:54,048;loved him, Myranda?
574;00:43:57,436;00:44:00,557;Did you imagine that he would be
574;00:43:57,436;00:44:00,557;with you forever, is that it?
575;00:44:00,606;00:44:02,773;And I came along and ruined it.
576;00:44:05,978;00:44:09,397;I'm Sansa Stark of Winterfell.
577;00:44:09,448;00:44:13,868;This is my home
577;00:44:09,448;00:44:13,868;and you can't frighten me.
578;00:44:19,675;00:44:22,460;Are you done with
578;00:44:19,675;00:44:22,460;your bath, my lady?
579;00:44:23,462;00:44:25,462;Go. I can finish
579;00:44:23,462;00:44:25,462;on my own.
580;00:44:49,905;00:44:52,440;Yes?
581;00:44:59,915;00:45:04,468;I've come to escort you
581;00:44:59,915;00:45:04,468;to the godswood, my lady.
582;00:45:09,041;00:45:12,343;If you please, my lady,
582;00:45:09,041;00:45:12,343;will you take my arm?
583;00:45:12,427;00:45:14,879;No.
584;00:45:14,930;00:45:18,215;Lord Ramsay, he said
584;00:45:14,930;00:45:18,215;I'm to take your arm.
585;00:45:18,267;00:45:19,767;I'm not touching you.
586;00:45:21,687;00:45:23,604;Please.
587;00:45:23,639;00:45:25,606;He'll punish me.
588;00:45:27,476;00:45:30,144;You think I care
588;00:45:27,476;00:45:30,144;what he does to you?
589;00:46:47,222;00:46:50,191;Who comes before
589;00:46:47,222;00:46:50,191;the old gods this night?
590;00:46:51,393;00:46:54,812;Sansa of the House Stark
591;00:46:54,863;00:46:57,565;comes here to be wed.
592;00:46:59,735;00:47:03,487;A woman grown,
592;00:46:59,735;00:47:03,487;trueborn and noble.
593;00:47:03,538;00:47:07,958;She comes to beg the
593;00:47:03,538;00:47:07,958;blessings of the gods.
594;00:47:09,795;00:47:11,912;Who comes to claim her?
595;00:47:20,839;00:47:22,807;Ramsay of House Bolton.
596;00:47:24,142;00:47:26,427;Heir to the Dreadfort
596;00:47:24,142;00:47:26,427;and Winterfell.
597;00:47:28,930;00:47:31,399;Who gives her?
598;00:47:33,652;00:47:38,856;Theon of House Greyjoy,
598;00:47:33,652;00:47:38,856;who was--
599;00:47:43,278;00:47:44,829;who was her father's ward.
600;00:47:47,115;00:47:50,668;Lady Sansa,
600;00:47:47,115;00:47:50,668;will you take this man?
601;00:48:20,449;00:48:22,266;I take this man.
602;00:48:53,765;00:48:55,933;Are you pleased, my lady?
603;00:48:58,687;00:49:01,722;Good. I want you
603;00:48:58,687;00:49:01,722;to be happy.
604;00:49:11,917;00:49:14,585;My father said
604;00:49:11,917;00:49:14,585;you're still a virgin.
605;00:49:20,208;00:49:22,877;Uh, yes.
605;00:49:20,208;00:49:22,877;Why?
606;00:49:26,548;00:49:29,800;Why are you still a virgin?
607;00:49:30,486;00:49:32,105;Afraid of dwarves?
608;00:49:33,638;00:49:35,723;Lord-- Lord Tyrion was kind.
609;00:49:35,774;00:49:39,326;He was gentle.
609;00:49:35,774;00:49:39,326;He never touched me.
610;00:49:40,962;00:49:42,313;You're not lying to me?
611;00:49:42,397;00:49:44,148;No, my lord.
612;00:49:44,182;00:49:46,917;Lying to your husband
612;00:49:44,182;00:49:46,917;on his wedding night,
613;00:49:46,952;00:49:50,454;that would be a bad way
613;00:49:46,952;00:49:50,454;to start a marriage.
614;00:49:55,377;00:49:58,495;We're man and wife now.
615;00:49:58,547;00:50:00,581;We should be honest
615;00:49:58,547;00:50:00,581;with each other.
616;00:50:00,715;00:50:02,416;Don't you think?
617;00:50:03,418;00:50:05,336;Yes.
618;00:50:15,347;00:50:17,181;Good.
619;00:50:19,434;00:50:21,268;Take off your clothes.
620;00:50:25,240;00:50:27,274;Oh, no, no, no.
621;00:50:27,359;00:50:30,327;You stay here, Reek.
622;00:50:30,362;00:50:32,613;You watch.
623;00:50:44,676;00:50:47,695;Do I need to ask a second time?
624;00:50:47,762;00:50:49,964;I hate asking a second time.
625;00:51:17,909;00:51:19,126;Reek...
626;00:51:19,160;00:51:22,363;I told you to watch.
627;00:51:28,103;00:51:31,171;You've known Sansa
627;00:51:28,103;00:51:31,171;since she was a girl.
628;00:51:32,474;00:51:34,092;Now watch her become a woman.
