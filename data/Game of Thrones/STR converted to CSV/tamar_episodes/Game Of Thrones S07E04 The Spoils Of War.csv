263;00:18:24,670;00:18:26,540;Why would you go back there?
264;00:18:26,550;00:18:29,140;Cersei's on her list of names.
265;00:18:40,670;00:18:42,540;Who else is on your list?
266;00:18:42,550;00:18:44,300;Most of them are dead already.
267;00:18:55,420;00:18:57,750;Where did you get this?
268;00:18:57,760;00:18:59,180;Littlefinger gave it to me.
269;00:19:00,470;00:19:02,719;Littlefinger?
269;00:19:00,470;00:19:02,719;He's here?
270;00:19:02,720;00:19:04,595;He has declared for House Stark.
271;00:19:04,596;00:19:06,460;Why would he give you a dagger?
272;00:19:06,470;00:19:08,969;He thought
272;00:19:06,470;00:19:08,969;I'd want it.
272;00:19:06,470;00:19:08,969;Sansa: Why?
273;00:19:08,970;00:19:10,680;Because it was meant to kill me.
274;00:19:10,681;00:19:15,540;The cutthroat...
274;00:19:10,681;00:19:15,540;after your fall?
275;00:19:15,550;00:19:18,430;Why would a cutthroat
275;00:19:15,550;00:19:18,430;have a Valyrian steel dagger?
276;00:19:18,431;00:19:21,460;Someone very wealthy
276;00:19:18,431;00:19:21,460;wanted me dead.
277;00:19:21,470;00:19:22,635;He's not a generous man.
278;00:19:22,636;00:19:24,000;He wouldn't give you anything
279;00:19:24,010;00:19:25,930;unless he thought
279;00:19:24,010;00:19:25,930;he was getting
279;00:19:24,010;00:19:25,930;something back.
280;00:19:28,300;00:19:31,299;It doesn't matter.
280;00:19:28,300;00:19:31,299;What do you mean
280;00:19:28,300;00:19:31,299;it doesn't matter?
281;00:19:31,300;00:19:33,220;I don't want it.
282;00:19:37,510;00:19:38,550;Are you sure?
283;00:19:39,840;00:19:41,250;Arya:
283;00:19:39,840;00:19:41,250;It's Valyrian steel.
284;00:19:41,260;00:19:43,640;It's wasted on a cripple.

289;00:20:25,300;00:20:26,719;I did next to nothing.
290;00:20:26,720;00:20:28,640;You're too hard
290;00:20:26,720;00:20:28,640;on yourself, my lady.

296;00:20:56,260;00:20:57,919;Soon.
297;00:20:57,920;00:20:59,750;He will come back to you.
298;00:21:01,630;00:21:02,960;He'd better.
299;00:21:05,210;00:21:07,919;What happened?
300;00:21:07,920;00:21:09,250;Many things.
301;00:21:12,590;00:21:13,790;Many things?

305;00:21:45,470;00:21:46,719;I wanted you to see it
306;00:21:46,720;00:21:49,470;before we start
306;00:21:46,720;00:21:49,470;hacking it to bits.
307;00:22:26,550;00:22:29,390;Well, this is it.
307;00:22:26,550;00:22:29,390;All we'll ever need.
308;00:22:35,420;00:22:38,880;There is something else
308;00:22:35,420;00:22:38,880;I want to show you,
308;00:22:35,420;00:22:38,880;Your Grace.

310;00:23:06,101;00:23:07,920;When?
311;00:23:13,420;00:23:15,710;A very long time ago.
312;00:23:18,880;00:23:21,339;They were right here,
313;00:23:21,340;00:23:23,750;standing where we're standing.
314;00:23:23,760;00:23:28,919;Before there were Targaryens
314;00:23:23,760;00:23:28,919;or Starks or Lannisters.
315;00:23:28,920;00:23:31,000;Maybe even before
315;00:23:28,920;00:23:31,000;there were men.
316;00:23:32,090;00:23:33,340;No.
317;00:23:43,880;00:23:48,589;They were here together,

318;00:23:48,590;00:23:50,790;Fighting each other?
319;00:24:01,340;00:24:06,379;They fought together
319;00:24:01,340;00:24:06,379;against their common enemy.
320;00:24:06,380;00:24:10,250;Despite their differences,
320;00:24:06,380;00:24:10,250;despite their suspicions.
321;00:24:12,420;00:24:13,420;Together.
322;00:24:15,260;00:24:18,350;We need to do the same
322;00:24:15,260;00:24:18,350;if we're going to survive.
323;00:24:21,970;00:24:24,180;Because the enemy is real.
324;00:24:25,800;00:24:27,430;It's always been real.
325;00:24:37,970;00:24:39,719;And you say
325;00:24:37,970;00:24:39,719;you can't defeat them
326;00:24:39,720;00:24:43,629;without my armies
326;00:24:39,720;00:24:43,629;and my dragons?
327;00:24:43,630;00:24:46,250;No, I don't think I can.
328;00:24:54,470;00:24:56,759;I will fight for you.
329;00:24:56,760;00:24:58,640;I will fight for the North.

331;00:25:10,510;00:25:12,050;My people...
332;00:25:13,470;00:25:15,759;won't accept a southern ruler.

334;00:25:21,800;00:25:24,350;They will if their king does.

336;00:25:29,010;00:25:31,180;They chose you to protect them.
337;00:25:32,800;00:25:36,010;Isn't their survival
337;00:25:32,800;00:25:36,010;more important than

338;00:25:56,380;00:25:58,460;What is it?
339;00:25:58,470;00:26:01,209;We took Casterly Rock.
340;00:26:01,210;00:26:03,210;That's very good to hear.

342;00:26:16,920;00:26:19,209;You'll want
342;00:26:16,920;00:26:19,209;to discuss this

343;00:26:19,210;00:26:20,880;You will stay.
344;00:26:21,970;00:26:23,969;All my allies are gone.

345;00:26:23,970;00:26:26,390;while I've been sitting
345;00:26:23,970;00:26:26,390;here on this island.

347;00:26:28,920;00:26:31,000;because Cersei has taken
347;00:26:28,920;00:26:31,000;all the food from the Reach.

399;00:29:56,130;00:29:58,540;It's too small.
400;00:29:58,550;00:30:00,760;I won't cut you.
400;00:29:58,550;00:30:00,760;Don't worry.
401;00:30:02,170;00:30:04,130;I'll try not to.

411;00:31:58,010;00:32:00,680;Who?

412;00:32:00,681;00:32:05,129;I believe you know

413;00:32:05,130;00:32:07,460;I think she has a good heart.
414;00:32:07,470;00:32:09,259;A good heart?
415;00:32:09,260;00:32:11,930;I've noticed you staring
415;00:32:09,260;00:32:11,930;at her good heart.
416;00:32:11,931;00:32:14,750;There's no time for that.
417;00:32:14,760;00:32:17,600;I saw the Night King, Davos.
417;00:32:14,760;00:32:17,600;I looked into his eyes.
418;00:32:19,090;00:32:21,500;How many men do we have
418;00:32:19,090;00:32:21,500;in the North to fight him?

420;00:32:23,050;00:32:25,169;Fewer.
420;00:32:23,050;00:32:25,169;What?
421;00:32:25,170;00:32:28,710;Speaking of good hearts--
421;00:32:25,170;00:32:28,710;Missandei of Naath.
422;00:32:29,840;00:32:32,710;Ser Davos, Lord Snow.
423;00:32:32,720;00:32:34,259;King Snow, isn't it?
424;00:32:34,260;00:32:35,635;No, that doesn't sound right.
425;00:32:35,636;00:32:37,500;King Jon?
425;00:32:35,636;00:32:37,500;It doesn't matter.

426;00:32:37,510;00:32:40,339;but may I ask
426;00:32:37,510;00:32:40,339;a question?
427;00:32:40,340;00:32:42,290;Of course.
428;00:32:42,300;00:32:46,180;Your name is Jon Snow,
428;00:32:42,300;00:32:46,180;but your father's name
428;00:32:42,300;00:32:46,180;was Ned Stark?
429;00:32:46,181;00:32:48,340;I'm a bastard.
430;00:32:50,210;00:32:52,290;My mother and father
430;00:32:50,210;00:32:52,290;weren't married.
431;00:32:52,300;00:32:54,259;Is the custom
431;00:32:52,300;00:32:54,259;different in Naath?
432;00:32:54,260;00:32:56,180;We don't have marriage in Naath,
433;00:32:56,181;00:32:59,129;so the concept
433;00:32:56,181;00:32:59,129;of a bastard
433;00:32:56,181;00:32:59,129;doesn't exist.
434;00:32:59,130;00:33:02,630;That sounds...
434;00:32:59,130;00:33:02,630;liberating.
435;00:33:04,630;00:33:06,839;Why did you leave your homeland?
436;00:33:06,840;00:33:09,460;I was stolen away by slavers.
437;00:33:09,470;00:33:10,969;I'm sorry.
438;00:33:10,970;00:33:14,089;If I may, how did a slave girl
439;00:33:14,090;00:33:16,339;come to advise
439;00:33:14,090;00:33:16,339;Daenerys Targaryen?
440;00:33:16,340;00:33:20,209;She bought me
440;00:33:16,340;00:33:20,209;from my master
440;00:33:16,340;00:33:20,209;and set me free.
441;00:33:20,210;00:33:22,000;Davos:
441;00:33:20,210;00:33:22,000;That was good of her.
442;00:33:22,010;00:33:25,969;Of course, you're
442;00:33:22,010;00:33:25,969;serving her now,
442;00:33:22,010;00:33:25,969;aren't you?
443;00:33:25,970;00:33:30,129;I serve my queen
443;00:33:25,970;00:33:30,129;because I want to
443;00:33:25,970;00:33:30,129;serve my queen.
444;00:33:30,130;00:33:31,879;Because I believe in her.
445;00:33:31,880;00:33:34,839;And if you wanted to sail
445;00:33:31,880;00:33:34,839;home to Naath tomorrow?
446;00:33:34,840;00:33:38,170;Then she would
446;00:33:34,840;00:33:38,170;give me a ship
446;00:33:34,840;00:33:38,170;and wish me good fortune.

451;00:33:47,880;00:33:50,540;She's not our queen
451;00:33:47,880;00:33:50,540;because she's the daughter
452;00:33:50,550;00:33:53,669;of some king we never knew.
453;00:33:53,670;00:33:56,460;She's the queen we chose.
454;00:33:58,050;00:34:00,350;Will you forgive me
454;00:33:58,050;00:34:00,350;if I switch sides?

465;00:35:14,880;00:35:16,920;is the only reason
