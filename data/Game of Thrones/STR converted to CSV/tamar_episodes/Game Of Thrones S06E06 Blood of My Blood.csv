5;00:02:51,964;00:02:53,764;Burn them all!
6;00:03:24,296;00:03:25,629;Please.
7;00:03:38,477;00:03:40,710;Burn them.

9;00:04:05,337;00:04:08,171;Meera.
10;00:04:08,273;00:04:10,240;They found us.
11;00:04:17,482;00:04:20,417;I'm so sorry.
12;00:05:24,583;00:05:26,016;Come with me, now.
13;00:05:31,023;00:05:33,356;The dead don't rest.
14;00:05:59,184;00:06:00,884;It's so green.
15;00:06:00,986;00:06:02,652;Oh, yes.
16;00:06:02,754;00:06:04,554;Once you get south
16;00:06:02,754;00:06:04,554;of the Riverlands,
17;00:06:04,656;00:06:07,557;very different sorts of trees
17;00:06:04,656;00:06:07,557;start to take over.
18;00:06:07,659;00:06:11,361;Maple, elm,
18;00:06:07,659;00:06:11,361;beech, poplar.
19;00:06:14,933;00:06:16,833;The odd willow.
20;00:06:16,935;00:06:19,402;And of course
20;00:06:16,935;00:06:19,402;now that summer's over,
21;00:06:19,504;00:06:22,305;you'll start seeing
21;00:06:19,504;00:06:22,305;the autumn colors coming in.
22;00:06:24,776;00:06:28,812;Still, you'll find more green here
22;00:06:24,776;00:06:28,812;than anywhere else.
23;00:06:28,914;00:06:32,582;You're nervous.
23;00:06:28,914;00:06:32,582;You're a nervous talker.
24;00:06:37,389;00:06:39,789;That's not any better
24;00:06:37,389;00:06:39,789;being a nervous mute.
25;00:06:39,891;00:06:42,359;I didn't think
25;00:06:39,891;00:06:42,359;I'd ever come back here
26;00:06:42,461;00:06:44,728;after my father made me
26;00:06:42,461;00:06:44,728;renounce my title
27;00:06:44,830;00:06:46,696;and inheritance
28;00:06:46,798;00:06:49,232;and, well, threaten
28;00:06:46,798;00:06:49,232;to kill me if I didn't.
29;00:06:50,802;00:06:53,169;A person just doesn't
29;00:06:50,802;00:06:53,169;feel welcome at that point.
30;00:06:55,240;00:06:58,475;And I certainly didn't expect to be
30;00:06:55,240;00:06:58,475;introducing him to my family.
31;00:06:59,945;00:07:02,412;So you know
31;00:06:59,945;00:07:02,412;what to tell them.
32;00:07:02,514;00:07:04,381;That Little Sam
32;00:07:02,514;00:07:04,381;is your baby.
33;00:07:04,483;00:07:06,049;Yes, now that's
33;00:07:04,483;00:07:06,049;very important.
34;00:07:06,151;00:07:08,651;If he thinks that
34;00:07:06,151;00:07:08,651;Little Sam is his grandchild,
35;00:07:08,754;00:07:10,620;he'll take you in.
36;00:07:10,722;00:07:14,124;He'll get an education.
36;00:07:10,722;00:07:14,124;He'll learn to read.
37;00:07:14,226;00:07:17,127;And you can help teach him.
37;00:07:14,226;00:07:17,127;Huh?
38;00:07:17,229;00:07:20,163;What did you tell
38;00:07:17,229;00:07:20,163;your family about me?
39;00:07:23,635;00:07:26,036;I told them I met you
39;00:07:23,635;00:07:26,036;in the North.
40;00:07:26,138;00:07:28,004;Did you tell them
40;00:07:26,138;00:07:28,004;how far north?
41;00:07:28,106;00:07:31,207;Well, it wasn't a very
41;00:07:28,106;00:07:31,207;large piece of parchment.
42;00:07:31,309;00:07:32,989;You didn't tell them
42;00:07:31,309;00:07:32,989;where I'm really from?
43;00:07:33,078;00:07:34,878;You didn't tell them
43;00:07:33,078;00:07:34,878;I'm a wildling?
44;00:07:34,980;00:07:37,080;The thing is...
45;00:07:37,182;00:07:39,516;my father doesn't
45;00:07:37,182;00:07:39,516;like wildlings.
46;00:07:39,618;00:07:43,987;He hoped I'd make a man of myself
46;00:07:39,618;00:07:43,987;by killing some bloody wildlings,
47;00:07:44,089;00:07:47,657;so it's probably a good subject to avoid
47;00:07:44,089;00:07:47,657;if at all possible.
48;00:07:50,529;00:07:52,896;I think we're here.
49;00:08:22,394;00:08:23,660;Sam.
50;00:08:23,762;00:08:25,995;Oh, Sam.
51;00:08:26,098;00:08:28,231;Oh, hello, Mother.
52;00:08:30,936;00:08:32,902;I never thought
52;00:08:30,936;00:08:32,902;I'd see you again.
53;00:08:33,004;00:08:35,605;You look wonderful.
53;00:08:33,004;00:08:35,605;Oh.
54;00:08:38,510;00:08:39,843;Talla?
55;00:08:39,945;00:08:42,712;Gods, you're a woman now.
56;00:08:42,814;00:08:45,281;Father says I have
56;00:08:42,814;00:08:45,281;to marry Symun Fossoway.
57;00:08:45,383;00:08:48,418;He has yellow teeth--
57;00:08:45,383;00:08:48,418;That's enough, Talla.
58;00:08:50,455;00:08:54,791;Oh, um, Mother,
58;00:08:50,455;00:08:54,791;this is Gilly.
59;00:08:57,062;00:08:59,329;Oh, my.
60;00:08:59,431;00:09:01,531;You are lovely.
61;00:09:03,502;00:09:06,035;I am happy to know you,
61;00:09:03,502;00:09:06,035;Lady Tarly.
62;00:09:09,341;00:09:12,208;Oh, and this,
63;00:09:12,310;00:09:14,711;this is our son
63;00:09:12,310;00:09:14,711;Samwell.
64;00:09:19,551;00:09:22,752;Hello, little one.
65;00:09:22,854;00:09:26,222;It's me,
65;00:09:22,854;00:09:26,222;your grandmother.
66;00:09:27,993;00:09:29,425;May I hold him?
67;00:09:29,528;00:09:31,427;Yes, of course.
68;00:09:35,467;00:09:37,333;Oh.
69;00:09:37,435;00:09:39,869;You have a curious mind,
69;00:09:37,435;00:09:39,869;I can tell.
70;00:09:39,971;00:09:43,239;You'll be a scholar
70;00:09:39,971;00:09:43,239;like your father.
71;00:09:43,341;00:09:47,377;Where is Father?
71;00:09:43,341;00:09:47,377;And Dickon?
72;00:09:47,479;00:09:49,312;They're on a hunt.
73;00:09:50,515;00:09:52,549;They'll join us
73;00:09:50,515;00:09:52,549;for dinner.
74;00:09:52,651;00:09:55,985;Come inside.
74;00:09:52,651;00:09:55,985;Such a journey.
75;00:09:56,087;00:09:57,787;You must be exhausted.
76;00:09:57,889;00:10:01,257;Come, you'll be wanting a bath after
76;00:09:57,889;00:10:01,257;all that travel.
77;00:10:01,359;00:10:03,459;Oh, and a dress
77;00:10:01,359;00:10:03,459;for dinner.
78;00:10:03,562;00:10:05,228;You can wear
78;00:10:03,562;00:10:05,228;one of mine.
79;00:10:05,330;00:10:07,163;What's your color?
80;00:10:07,265;00:10:09,632;Midnight blue
80;00:10:07,265;00:10:09,632;or silver?
81;00:10:09,734;00:10:11,834;Silver, maybe.
81;00:10:09,734;00:10:11,834;Come.
82;00:10:11,937;00:10:14,304;You can choose
82;00:10:11,937;00:10:14,304;one of my bedrooms if you want.
83;00:10:23,315;00:10:25,848;Is there no other way?
84;00:10:25,951;00:10:27,517;You're afraid for her?
85;00:10:27,619;00:10:30,386;Of course
85;00:10:27,619;00:10:30,386;I'm afraid for her!
86;00:10:32,958;00:10:36,559;It just seems
86;00:10:32,958;00:10:36,559;very dangerous.
87;00:10:36,661;00:10:39,095;She'll be protected
87;00:10:36,661;00:10:39,095;the entire way.
88;00:10:39,197;00:10:41,764;The Faith Militant
88;00:10:39,197;00:10:41,764;are very stern
89;00:10:41,866;00:10:44,467;with those who overstep
89;00:10:41,866;00:10:44,467;their bounds.
90;00:10:46,304;00:10:49,872;And Queen Margaery
90;00:10:46,304;00:10:49,872;isn't your mother.
91;00:10:49,975;00:10:52,909;I suspect the gods will
91;00:10:49,975;00:10:52,909;predispose the common people
92;00:10:53,011;00:10:55,545;to gentleness
92;00:10:53,011;00:10:55,545;on her behalf.
93;00:10:55,647;00:10:58,114;She's truly opened
93;00:10:55,647;00:10:58,114;her heart to them.
94;00:10:58,216;00:11:01,985;She's always been very devoted
94;00:10:58,216;00:11:01,985;to the poor and the unfortunate.
95;00:11:02,087;00:11:04,921;And now she's devoted
95;00:11:02,087;00:11:04,921;to the gods as well.
96;00:11:07,125;00:11:09,359;Would you like
96;00:11:07,125;00:11:09,359;to see her?
97;00:11:30,715;00:11:32,448;Have they hurt you?
98;00:11:32,550;00:11:33,950;Have they
98;00:11:32,550;00:11:33,950;mistreated you?
99;00:11:34,052;00:11:37,120;No, Your Grace.
99;00:11:34,052;00:11:37,120;I've missed you.
100;00:11:37,222;00:11:38,921;More than you could know.
101;00:11:39,024;00:11:41,190;We'll be together
101;00:11:39,024;00:11:41,190;again soon
102;00:11:41,293;00:11:44,027;and everything will be better
102;00:11:41,293;00:11:44,027;than it was before.
103;00:11:44,129;00:11:46,062;Better how?
104;00:11:46,164;00:11:47,530;Soon the--
105;00:11:50,001;00:11:51,801;walk of atonement.
106;00:11:53,305;00:11:55,438;He says there's
106;00:11:53,305;00:11:55,438;no other way.
107;00:11:55,540;00:11:58,641;Have you spoken to him at all,
107;00:11:55,540;00:11:58,641;the High Sparrow?
108;00:11:58,743;00:12:02,111;Yes, a few times.
109;00:12:02,213;00:12:03,546;Have you?
110;00:12:03,648;00:12:05,148;Yes, I have.
111;00:12:05,250;00:12:07,917;He's not quite what we thought
111;00:12:05,250;00:12:07,917;he was, is he?
112;00:12:09,454;00:12:12,188;You think I'm mad.
113;00:12:12,290;00:12:14,357;I sound mad.
114;00:12:14,459;00:12:16,392;No.
114;00:12:14,459;00:12:16,392;No, you don't.
115;00:12:16,494;00:12:18,528;You--
115;00:12:16,494;00:12:18,528;you could never.
116;00:12:18,630;00:12:20,296;You're right,
116;00:12:18,630;00:12:20,296;he's not.
117;00:12:20,398;00:12:22,098;He's a lot more--
118;00:12:22,200;00:12:23,733;He is.
119;00:12:23,835;00:12:25,935;There's something
119;00:12:23,835;00:12:25,935;about him.
120;00:12:26,037;00:12:28,104;His way of looking
120;00:12:26,037;00:12:28,104;at the world.
121;00:12:30,475;00:12:35,645;It's not an easy thing admitting
121;00:12:30,475;00:12:35,645;to yourself what you really are.
122;00:12:35,747;00:12:37,680;It's taken me a while.
123;00:12:37,782;00:12:39,816;He's helped me.
124;00:12:39,918;00:12:41,818;What are you
124;00:12:39,918;00:12:41,818;talking about?
125;00:12:41,920;00:12:46,255;You're a good person.
125;00:12:41,920;00:12:46,255;You've always been a good person.
126;00:12:46,358;00:12:49,525;You're the best person I know.
127;00:12:49,627;00:12:52,628;I was just telling him
127;00:12:49,627;00:12:52,628;about your devotion to the poor.
128;00:12:52,731;00:12:54,530;Ah, yes, I visited
128;00:12:52,731;00:12:54,530;their hovels
129;00:12:54,632;00:12:58,034;and I fed them soup
129;00:12:54,632;00:12:58,034;and I made sure I was seen doing it.
130;00:12:59,471;00:13:02,839;I never gave them what
130;00:12:59,471;00:13:02,839;they really needed, though.
131;00:13:02,941;00:13:07,610;I've had lots of time to think about
131;00:13:02,941;00:13:07,610;how good I was at seeming good.
132;00:13:09,214;00:13:11,814;All those stories
132;00:13:09,214;00:13:11,814;I told myself about who I was
133;00:13:11,916;00:13:14,550;and why I did
133;00:13:11,916;00:13:14,550;the things I did.
134;00:13:15,787;00:13:18,454;There were so many lies
134;00:13:15,787;00:13:18,454;in those stories.
135;00:13:20,258;00:13:21,958;I don't understand.
136;00:13:22,060;00:13:24,227;It's all right.
136;00:13:22,060;00:13:24,227;It really is.
137;00:13:24,329;00:13:27,797;It's such a relief
137;00:13:24,329;00:13:27,797;to let go of those lies.
138;00:13:32,871;00:13:34,737;What about Loras?
139;00:13:36,674;00:13:38,274;I love my brother.
140;00:13:38,376;00:13:42,211;I will always
140;00:13:38,376;00:13:42,211;love my brother.
141;00:13:42,313;00:13:46,616;His soul is pure
141;00:13:42,313;00:13:46,616;and perfect.
142;00:13:46,718;00:13:49,218;His sins don't erase
142;00:13:46,718;00:13:49,218;that purity,
143;00:13:49,320;00:13:51,354;they only obscure it.
144;00:13:51,456;00:13:55,858;He just needs
144;00:13:51,456;00:13:55,858;to atone for them.
145;00:13:57,095;00:13:58,394;We all do.
146;00:13:58,496;00:14:01,697;Sooner or later,
146;00:13:58,496;00:14:01,697;one way or another.
147;00:14:03,034;00:14:06,068;The gods have a plan
147;00:14:03,034;00:14:06,068;for us all.
148;00:14:21,419;00:14:24,253;It's hard
148;00:14:21,419;00:14:24,253;to walk in this.
149;00:14:26,458;00:14:28,357;It's beautiful.
150;00:14:30,228;00:14:32,028;You're beautiful.
151;00:15:19,210;00:15:23,079;This venison,
151;00:15:19,210;00:15:23,079;it's very tasty.
152;00:15:23,181;00:15:25,715;Is it from today's hunt?
153;00:15:25,817;00:15:27,717;Well, no.
154;00:15:27,819;00:15:29,752;We haven't been able
154;00:15:27,819;00:15:29,752;to cure that one yet.
155;00:15:29,854;00:15:31,754;This is last week's.
156;00:15:31,856;00:15:35,391;Oh, of course.
156;00:15:31,856;00:15:35,391;Sorry.
157;00:15:35,493;00:15:37,460;Long journey.
158;00:15:37,562;00:15:40,062;Brought it down
158;00:15:37,562;00:15:40,062;from 70 yards.
159;00:15:40,164;00:15:41,764;One shot.
160;00:15:41,866;00:15:45,301;Oh, that's a fair
160;00:15:41,866;00:15:45,301;distance.
161;00:15:45,403;00:15:48,271;So do you do much hunting
161;00:15:45,403;00:15:48,271;up at the Wall?
162;00:15:48,373;00:15:51,040;Oh, yes.
162;00:15:48,373;00:15:51,040;Yes.
163;00:15:51,142;00:15:52,708;A good amount.
164;00:15:53,878;00:15:55,444;North of the Wall,
165;00:15:55,547;00:15:57,680;you don't hunt,
165;00:15:55,547;00:15:57,680;you don't eat.
166;00:15:57,782;00:15:59,248;Mm-hmm.
167;00:15:59,350;00:16:01,217;Mostly deer
167;00:15:59,350;00:16:01,217;or is it elk as well?
168;00:16:02,720;00:16:04,921;Rabbits.
169;00:16:05,023;00:16:07,290;Sometimes squirrels.
170;00:16:10,495;00:16:14,297;I say we,
170;00:16:10,495;00:16:14,297;it's my friend Jon mostly.
171;00:16:14,399;00:16:16,198;Sometimes Edd.
172;00:16:16,301;00:16:17,967;Oh, and Gilly.
173;00:16:18,069;00:16:21,037;She's-- she's quite
173;00:16:18,069;00:16:21,037;a good hunter as well.
174;00:16:22,073;00:16:24,373;Um, huntress.
175;00:16:24,475;00:16:26,676;I imagine it's common
175;00:16:24,475;00:16:26,676;where you're from.
176;00:16:26,778;00:16:30,212;We once met a man, Lord Umber
176;00:16:26,778;00:16:30,212;from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll,
177;00:16:30,315;00:16:32,548;who said he taught all
177;00:16:30,315;00:16:32,548;his daughters how to hunt.
178;00:16:32,650;00:16:35,151;Your father
178;00:16:32,650;00:16:35,151;taught you to hunt?
179;00:16:35,253;00:16:37,086;Our father
179;00:16:35,253;00:16:37,086;would never teach us.
180;00:16:37,188;00:16:41,190;I think our father could learn a thing
180;00:16:37,188;00:16:41,190;or two from your father.
181;00:16:41,292;00:16:42,592;That's enough of that.
182;00:16:46,064;00:16:47,630;Samwell, would you care
182;00:16:46,064;00:16:47,630;for more bread?
183;00:16:47,732;00:16:50,700;Oh, yes.
183;00:16:47,732;00:16:50,700;Yes, please.
184;00:16:50,802;00:16:52,368;Thank you, Mother.
185;00:16:56,474;00:16:58,608;Not fat enough already?
186;00:17:10,555;00:17:13,389;I travelled south under orders from
186;00:17:10,555;00:17:13,389;the Lord Commander.
187;00:17:13,491;00:17:15,725;He wants me to--
187;00:17:13,491;00:17:15,725;I read your letter.
188;00:17:17,562;00:17:19,528;You're to be a maester.
189;00:17:19,631;00:17:20,963;Yes.
190;00:17:21,065;00:17:22,832;And once
190;00:17:21,065;00:17:22,832;I have my chain,
191;00:17:22,934;00:17:25,434;I'll return
191;00:17:22,934;00:17:25,434;to Castle Black.
192;00:17:25,536;00:17:28,738;I thought the Night's Watch
192;00:17:25,536;00:17:28,738;might make a man of you.
193;00:17:30,341;00:17:32,541;Something resembling
193;00:17:30,341;00:17:32,541;a man at least.
194;00:17:33,945;00:17:37,480;You managed to stay
194;00:17:33,945;00:17:37,480;soft and fat.
195;00:17:39,384;00:17:41,984;Your nose buried in books.
196;00:17:42,086;00:17:46,522;Spending your life reading
196;00:17:42,086;00:17:46,522;about the achievements of better men.
197;00:17:46,624;00:17:50,092;I'll wager you still can't sit a horse
197;00:17:46,624;00:17:50,092;or wield a sword.
198;00:17:50,194;00:17:53,295;Randyll, to be maester
198;00:17:50,194;00:17:53,295;of the Night's Watch is a great honor.
199;00:17:53,398;00:17:55,731;He can wield a sword.
200;00:17:57,101;00:17:59,168;He killed a Thenn.
201;00:18:01,005;00:18:02,405;He killed
201;00:18:01,005;00:18:02,405;a white walker.
202;00:18:02,507;00:18:05,908;There's no such thing.
203;00:18:07,679;00:18:11,047;I saw it with my own eyes on our way
203;00:18:07,679;00:18:11,047;down to Castle Black.
204;00:18:11,149;00:18:14,784;He drove a dagger
204;00:18:11,149;00:18:14,784;into the walker's heart.
205;00:18:14,886;00:18:18,387;He risked his own life
205;00:18:14,886;00:18:18,387;to save mine more than once.
206;00:18:18,489;00:18:22,091;He's a greater warrior
206;00:18:18,489;00:18:22,091;than either of you will ever be.
207;00:18:24,429;00:18:27,430;Your way down
207;00:18:24,429;00:18:27,430;to Castle Black?
208;00:18:30,334;00:18:32,501;Where did he kill
208;00:18:30,334;00:18:32,501;a white walker?
209;00:18:35,006;00:18:37,206;Where are you from?
210;00:18:37,308;00:18:39,642;How'd you come
210;00:18:37,308;00:18:39,642;to meet my son?
211;00:18:41,813;00:18:44,146;The Night's Watch
211;00:18:41,813;00:18:44,146;came to our keep.
212;00:18:44,248;00:18:46,248;Where?
212;00:18:44,248;00:18:46,248;Gilly.
213;00:18:46,350;00:18:48,517;North of the Wall.
213;00:18:46,350;00:18:48,517;North of the Wall?
214;00:18:52,757;00:18:54,990;You're a wildling.
215;00:19:02,233;00:19:06,402;The Seven Kingdoms have waged war
215;00:19:02,233;00:19:06,402;against these savages for centuries
216;00:19:06,504;00:19:10,039;and here I sit
216;00:19:06,504;00:19:10,039;hosting one in my hall
217;00:19:10,141;00:19:13,242;thanks to my son.
218;00:19:15,513;00:19:17,012;See that sword?
219;00:19:19,917;00:19:22,818;It's called Heartsbane.
220;00:19:22,920;00:19:26,622;It's been in our family
220;00:19:22,920;00:19:26,622;for 500 years.
221;00:19:26,724;00:19:28,791;It's Valyrian steel.
222;00:19:28,893;00:19:31,360;Only a handful of them
222;00:19:28,893;00:19:31,360;left in the world.
223;00:19:31,462;00:19:35,331;It's supposed to go to my firstborn
223;00:19:31,462;00:19:35,331;son after I die.
224;00:19:35,433;00:19:37,066;To him.
225;00:19:38,336;00:19:41,737;He will never
225;00:19:38,336;00:19:41,737;wield that sword.
226;00:19:41,839;00:19:45,941;If he were to become
226;00:19:41,839;00:19:45,941;Lord Tarly of Horn Hill,
227;00:19:46,043;00:19:48,344;it would be the end
227;00:19:46,043;00:19:48,344;of this house.
228;00:19:51,015;00:19:53,983;I took you for a Mole's Town
228;00:19:51,015;00:19:53,983;whore when I saw you
229;00:19:54,085;00:19:55,651;and I made
229;00:19:54,085;00:19:55,651;my peace with that.
230;00:19:55,753;00:19:57,520;Who else would have him?
231;00:19:59,423;00:20:01,090;But I overestimated him.
232;00:20:02,627;00:20:04,360;No.
233;00:20:06,164;00:20:10,299;It was a wildling whore
233;00:20:06,164;00:20:10,299;that seduced my son.
234;00:20:12,503;00:20:14,570;This you getting
234;00:20:12,503;00:20:14,570;back at me, boy?
235;00:20:16,841;00:20:20,910;Hmm? Bringing that to my table
235;00:20:16,841;00:20:20,910;and making me dine with it?
236;00:20:23,381;00:20:25,815;And you got what you
236;00:20:23,381;00:20:25,815;were after, didn't you?
237;00:20:25,917;00:20:30,186;A bastard.
237;00:20:25,917;00:20:30,186;A half-breed bastard.
238;00:20:30,288;00:20:32,855;Your invitation
238;00:20:30,288;00:20:32,855;into our home.
239;00:20:32,957;00:20:35,991;Come, my dear.
239;00:20:32,957;00:20:35,991;Talla.
240;00:20:37,195;00:20:39,161;I've lost my appetite.
241;00:20:39,263;00:20:40,629;He dishonors us.
242;00:20:40,731;00:20:43,599;You dishonor yourself.
243;00:20:47,505;00:20:50,973;Your mother's a fine woman.
243;00:20:47,505;00:20:50,973;You're not worthy of her.
244;00:20:53,678;00:20:58,080;To please her, I'll take the wildling in.
244;00:20:53,678;00:20:58,080;She can work in the kitchens.
245;00:20:58,182;00:21:01,183;The bastard
245;00:20:58,182;00:21:01,183;will be raised here.
246;00:21:04,055;00:21:07,590;But this will be the last night
246;00:21:04,055;00:21:07,590;you ever spend at Horn Hill.
247;00:21:15,366;00:21:18,567;I'm sorry I let him
247;00:21:15,366;00:21:18,567;treat you that way.
248;00:21:18,669;00:21:22,037;I was afraid he'd turn
248;00:21:18,669;00:21:22,037;you and Little Sam away.
249;00:21:22,139;00:21:25,040;I'm not angry at you.
250;00:21:25,142;00:21:27,176;I'm angry
250;00:21:25,142;00:21:27,176;that horrible people
251;00:21:27,278;00:21:29,778;can treat good people
251;00:21:27,278;00:21:29,778;that way and get away with it.
252;00:21:35,353;00:21:37,319;When do you have to go?
253;00:21:40,391;00:21:42,324;First light.
254;00:21:53,237;00:21:54,703;Say good-bye
254;00:21:53,237;00:21:54,703;to him for me.
255;00:22:02,980;00:22:06,081;You're not what
255;00:22:02,980;00:22:06,081;he thinks you are, Sam.
256;00:22:06,183;00:22:08,651;He doesn't know
256;00:22:06,183;00:22:08,651;what you are.
257;00:22:12,056;00:22:13,989;Good-bye, Gilly.
258;00:22:58,369;00:23:00,202;Sam?
258;00:22:58,369;00:23:00,202;We're leaving.
259;00:23:00,304;00:23:02,137;What?
259;00:23:00,304;00:23:02,137;Get your things.
260;00:23:02,239;00:23:05,274;I don't have
260;00:23:02,239;00:23:05,274;any things.
261;00:23:05,376;00:23:08,210;What are you doing?
261;00:23:05,376;00:23:08,210;We belong together.
262;00:23:08,312;00:23:10,212;All of us.
263;00:23:10,314;00:23:12,848;What about your mother
263;00:23:10,314;00:23:12,848;and sister?
264;00:23:12,950;00:23:14,883;Oh, they'll understand.
265;00:23:14,986;00:23:16,652;Your sister's dress.
266;00:23:16,754;00:23:18,620;She won't mind.
267;00:23:20,558;00:23:22,424;Looks better
267;00:23:20,558;00:23:22,424;on you anyway.
268;00:23:22,526;00:23:24,493;Sam.
269;00:23:24,595;00:23:26,662;That's your father's sword.
270;00:23:26,764;00:23:28,797;It's my family's sword.
271;00:23:33,604;00:23:35,371;Sam.
272;00:23:35,473;00:23:37,973;Won't he come for it?
273;00:23:39,610;00:23:41,777;He can bloody well try.
274;00:23:46,250;00:23:48,217;The lion
274;00:23:46,250;00:23:48,217;and the rose are one.
275;00:23:48,319;00:23:50,352;I thank the gods above.
276;00:23:50,454;00:23:52,955;And to you,
276;00:23:50,454;00:23:52,955;my beauteous bride,
277;00:23:53,057;00:23:55,090;I pledge undying love.
278;00:23:55,192;00:23:59,495;Hail King Joffrey.
278;00:23:55,192;00:23:59,495;Hail Queen Margaery.
279;00:23:59,597;00:24:02,231;I'll drink a toast
279;00:23:59,597;00:24:02,231;to my new queen,
280;00:24:02,333;00:24:04,666;for there is
280;00:24:02,333;00:24:04,666;no one fairer.
281;00:24:04,769;00:24:08,971;Dear Uncle, will you share my joy
281;00:24:04,769;00:24:08,971;and be my royal cupbearer?
282;00:24:09,073;00:24:11,840;Drink long and deep,
282;00:24:09,073;00:24:11,840;my noble king,
283;00:24:11,942;00:24:14,176;from this cup
283;00:24:11,942;00:24:14,176;of sweet wine.
284;00:24:14,278;00:24:16,812;The last drink
284;00:24:14,278;00:24:16,812;he shall ever take.
285;00:24:16,914;00:24:18,847;And vengeance
285;00:24:16,914;00:24:18,847;shall be mine.
286;00:24:30,461;00:24:32,661;Poison!
287;00:24:32,763;00:24:34,530;Murder!
288;00:24:34,632;00:24:37,032;I gasp.
288;00:24:34,632;00:24:37,032;I-- I die.
289;00:24:39,470;00:24:41,970;I limp.
290;00:24:42,073;00:24:44,206;And it was he...
291;00:24:44,308;00:24:47,409;...that poisoned me.
292;00:24:47,511;00:24:50,412;My evil Uncle Imp.
293;00:24:56,787;00:24:58,220;Calm down, dear.
294;00:25:02,593;00:25:04,560;My firstborn son.
295;00:25:04,662;00:25:07,062;My golden lion
296;00:25:07,164;00:25:09,665;foully, falsely slain.
297;00:25:11,302;00:25:13,936;I pray you found
297;00:25:11,302;00:25:13,936;a lasting peace
298;00:25:14,038;00:25:16,205;free from strife and pain.
299;00:25:18,676;00:25:20,943;Hear my prayer,
299;00:25:18,676;00:25:20,943;O cruel gods.
300;00:25:21,045;00:25:22,878;Take my life instead.
301;00:25:22,980;00:25:26,849;For I cannot face another day
301;00:25:22,980;00:25:26,849;when my sweet boy is dead.
302;00:25:26,951;00:25:29,852;Oh, woe.
303;00:25:29,954;00:25:31,920;Oh, grief.
304;00:25:33,424;00:25:36,692;Oh, darkest day,
304;00:25:33,424;00:25:36,692;my heart is full of sorrow.
305;00:25:39,730;00:25:41,630;All hope is lost.
306;00:25:42,933;00:25:44,766;All joy is gone.
307;00:25:48,005;00:25:50,873;And there is no tomorrow.
308;00:26:10,928;00:26:13,495;What is that
308;00:26:10,928;00:26:13,495;I hear and smell?
309;00:26:13,597;00:26:16,265;Someone I'll soon
309;00:26:13,597;00:26:16,265;send to hell.
310;00:26:16,367;00:26:18,934;It's time to see
310;00:26:16,367;00:26:18,934;if truth they told
311;00:26:19,036;00:26:22,671;who said Tywin Lannister
311;00:26:19,036;00:26:22,671;shits gold.
312;00:26:24,909;00:26:26,875;You beast.
312;00:26:24,909;00:26:26,875;You beast.
313;00:26:26,977;00:26:31,813;You killed my wife and now
313;00:26:26,977;00:26:31,813;you've taken your father's life.
314;00:26:31,916;00:26:34,683;No worse child
314;00:26:31,916;00:26:34,683;ever stained this land.
315;00:26:34,785;00:26:37,286;Curse the day I named you.
316;00:26:46,664;00:26:50,365;My greatest crime.
316;00:26:46,664;00:26:50,365;Now I must flee.
317;00:26:50,467;00:26:53,268;Then sail across
317;00:26:50,467;00:26:53,268;the Narrow Sea
318;00:26:53,370;00:26:57,506;to do unto you
318;00:26:53,370;00:26:57,506;more treachery.
319;00:26:57,608;00:27:01,310;Don't fear winter.
319;00:26:57,608;00:27:01,310;Fear me!
320;00:27:05,349;00:27:07,182;Thank you.
321;00:27:07,284;00:27:10,852;Ladies and gentlemen,
321;00:27:07,284;00:27:10,852;I give you Bianca,
322;00:27:10,955;00:27:12,888;Clarenzo.
323;00:27:12,990;00:27:16,625;I give you Bobono.
324;00:27:16,727;00:27:19,161;I give you Camello.
325;00:27:19,263;00:27:21,530;And last but not least,
326;00:27:21,632;00:27:23,765;sweet Lady Crane.
327;00:27:35,112;00:27:38,580;Give this a good beating.
327;00:27:35,112;00:27:38,580;Shake those fleas out. That's a dear.
328;00:27:38,682;00:27:40,816;That crowd was shit.
329;00:27:45,222;00:27:47,222;Girl.
330;00:27:47,324;00:27:49,658;What are you
330;00:27:47,324;00:27:49,658;doing back here?
331;00:27:49,760;00:27:51,159;Nothing.
332;00:27:51,262;00:27:54,630;I saw you the other day
332;00:27:51,262;00:27:54,630;in the audience.
333;00:27:54,732;00:27:57,666;How many times
333;00:27:54,732;00:27:57,666;have you seen this stupid play?
334;00:27:59,603;00:28:00,636;Three times.
335;00:28:00,738;00:28:02,437;Did you pay?
336;00:28:02,539;00:28:04,706;No.
337;00:28:08,212;00:28:10,512;I remember when the players
337;00:28:08,212;00:28:10,512;came to my village.
338;00:28:10,614;00:28:13,215;I didn't have any money,
338;00:28:10,614;00:28:13,215;so I snuck in.
339;00:28:13,317;00:28:15,484;Just like you.
340;00:28:15,586;00:28:17,686;Saw the painted faces,
340;00:28:15,586;00:28:17,686;the costumes,
341;00:28:17,788;00:28:19,354;listened to the songs,
342;00:28:19,456;00:28:22,891;cried when the young lovers
342;00:28:19,456;00:28:22,891;died in each other's arms.
343;00:28:22,993;00:28:26,762;I ran off and joined them the next day,
343;00:28:22,993;00:28:26,762;never looked back.
344;00:28:28,299;00:28:29,698;You're very good.
345;00:28:29,800;00:28:31,533;My final speech is shit.
346;00:28:31,635;00:28:34,903;But to be fair to myself,
346;00:28:31,635;00:28:34,903;which I always like to be,
347;00:28:35,005;00:28:37,239;the writing's no good.
348;00:28:37,341;00:28:39,241;So change it.
349;00:28:40,944;00:28:43,812;It would all just be farting, belching,
349;00:28:40,944;00:28:43,812;and slapping without you.
350;00:28:45,249;00:28:47,382;How would you change it?
351;00:28:52,790;00:28:55,991;The queen loves her son
351;00:28:52,790;00:28:55,991;more than anything.
352;00:28:56,093;00:28:59,127;And he was taken from her before she
352;00:28:56,093;00:28:59,127;could say good-bye.
353;00:28:59,229;00:29:01,229;She wouldn't just cry.
354;00:29:04,902;00:29:07,736;She would be angry.
355;00:29:07,838;00:29:10,405;She would want to kill
355;00:29:07,838;00:29:10,405;the person who did this to her.
356;00:29:14,611;00:29:15,777;What's your name?
357;00:29:17,514;00:29:19,614;Mercy.
358;00:29:19,717;00:29:22,417;You have very expressive
358;00:29:19,717;00:29:22,417;eyes, Mercy.
359;00:29:22,519;00:29:25,087;Wonderful eyebrows.
360;00:29:26,390;00:29:28,323;Do you like pretending
360;00:29:26,390;00:29:28,323;to be other people?
361;00:29:30,127;00:29:32,794;I have to go.
361;00:29:30,127;00:29:32,794;My father's waiting for me.
362;00:29:40,971;00:29:43,705;Lady Crane,
362;00:29:40,971;00:29:43,705;they loved you.
363;00:29:43,807;00:29:46,575;They were sweet.
363;00:29:43,807;00:29:46,575;Or drunk.
364;00:29:46,677;00:29:48,744;Drunkenly sweet.
365;00:29:48,846;00:29:50,412;No laugh
365;00:29:48,846;00:29:50,412;for Ned's death.
366;00:29:50,514;00:29:54,216;These people are worse
366;00:29:50,514;00:29:54,216;than animals.
367;00:29:55,452;00:29:58,120;But they loved her.
367;00:29:55,452;00:29:58,120;They all love her.
368;00:29:58,222;00:30:01,990;Yes, you are adored
368;00:29:58,222;00:30:01,990;by people and animals alike.
369;00:30:02,092;00:30:04,626;I do what I can
369;00:30:02,092;00:30:04,626;with what I'm given.
370;00:30:04,728;00:30:06,628;With what you're given?
371;00:30:06,730;00:30:08,563;Well, I was thinking--
372;00:30:08,665;00:30:10,165;Oh, we're all thinkers
372;00:30:08,665;00:30:10,165;now, are we?
373;00:30:10,267;00:30:13,068;Full to the tits
373;00:30:10,267;00:30:13,068;with ideas.
374;00:30:13,170;00:30:16,471;I didn't mean--
374;00:30:13,170;00:30:16,471;You have ideas, I have ideas,
375;00:30:16,573;00:30:18,340;he has ideas.
376;00:30:18,442;00:30:21,143;Why should my ideas
376;00:30:18,442;00:30:21,143;have any more value than yours
377;00:30:21,245;00:30:24,546;simply because I've been
377;00:30:21,245;00:30:24,546;doing this my whole life?
378;00:30:24,648;00:30:26,848;Who is anyone
378;00:30:24,648;00:30:26,848;to judge my work?
379;00:30:26,950;00:30:29,718;This is my profession.
379;00:30:26,950;00:30:29,718;I know what I'm doing.
380;00:30:29,820;00:30:31,753;You have no right
380;00:30:29,820;00:30:31,753;to an opinion.
381;00:30:45,068;00:30:47,335;Careful of that one.
382;00:30:51,141;00:30:53,208;She wants you dead.
383;00:31:32,483;00:31:34,049;And?
384;00:31:34,151;00:31:36,384;As I expected.
385;00:31:38,088;00:31:39,821;A shame.
386;00:31:39,923;00:31:41,923;A girl had many gifts.
387;00:31:44,928;00:31:46,795;You promised me.
388;00:31:52,936;00:31:54,970;Don't let her suffer.
389;00:32:46,390;00:32:49,491;Company, halt!
390;00:32:50,761;00:32:52,360;My lord.
391;00:32:52,462;00:32:54,296;My lord.
392;00:32:55,933;00:32:59,701;My friends,
392;00:32:55,933;00:32:59,701;the hour has come.
393;00:32:59,803;00:33:03,538;Madness has overtaken
393;00:32:59,803;00:33:03,538;this city
394;00:33:03,640;00:33:08,243;and grasped in
394;00:33:03,640;00:33:08,243;its claws my children.
395;00:33:08,345;00:33:11,513;But now we must
395;00:33:08,345;00:33:11,513;drive it back
396;00:33:11,615;00:33:14,683;under the rocks
396;00:33:11,615;00:33:14,683;whence it came.
397;00:33:14,785;00:33:19,321;Madness has had its day!
398;00:33:22,492;00:33:24,826;Forward, march!
399;00:33:27,397;00:33:31,132;Rich or poor,
399;00:33:27,397;00:33:31,132;noble or common,
400;00:33:31,234;00:33:35,403;if we sin,
400;00:33:31,234;00:33:35,403;we must atone.
401;00:33:36,974;00:33:39,474;Margaery of House Tyrell
402;00:33:39,576;00:33:42,010;came to us a sinner.
403;00:33:42,112;00:33:44,479;She stood
403;00:33:42,112;00:33:44,479;before the gods
404;00:33:44,581;00:33:47,048;in the holy Sept
404;00:33:44,581;00:33:47,048;and lied.
405;00:33:47,150;00:33:50,185;She turned a blind eye
405;00:33:47,150;00:33:50,185;to her brother's sins.
406;00:33:50,287;00:33:52,854;She disgraced her house,
407;00:33:52,956;00:33:56,224;her king,
407;00:33:52,956;00:33:56,224;and herself.
408;00:34:27,824;00:34:29,691;Company, halt!
409;00:34:29,793;00:34:32,060;Face front!
410;00:34:32,162;00:34:33,895;Turn!
411;00:34:35,799;00:34:38,566;Lord Tyrell.
412;00:34:38,669;00:34:40,935;Ser Jaime.
413;00:34:41,038;00:34:42,937;Sorry to interrupt.
414;00:34:43,040;00:34:45,740;We're here for Queen Margaery
414;00:34:43,040;00:34:45,740;and Ser Loras Tyrell.
415;00:34:45,842;00:34:49,110;Give them to us
415;00:34:45,842;00:34:49,110;and we'll be on our way.
416;00:34:49,212;00:34:53,314;I don't have the authority
416;00:34:49,212;00:34:53,314;to give them to you.
417;00:34:53,417;00:34:56,251;And you don't have
417;00:34:53,417;00:34:56,251;the authority to take them.
418;00:34:56,353;00:34:58,186;That's right.
419;00:35:00,457;00:35:01,623;Hyah.
420;00:35:06,897;00:35:09,931;Lock spears!
421;00:35:10,033;00:35:14,202;I speak for King Tommen
421;00:35:10,033;00:35:14,202;of House Baratheon, First of His Name.
422;00:35:14,304;00:35:17,372;The gods don't recognize
422;00:35:14,304;00:35:17,372;his authority in this matter.
423;00:35:17,474;00:35:20,208;You've already insulted
423;00:35:17,474;00:35:20,208;one great house.
424;00:35:20,310;00:35:22,277;It won't happen twice.
425;00:35:22,379;00:35:24,612;Every last sparrow
425;00:35:22,379;00:35:24,612;will die
426;00:35:24,715;00:35:27,182;before Margaery Tyrell
426;00:35:24,715;00:35:27,182;walks down that street.
427;00:35:27,284;00:35:29,784;To die in the service
427;00:35:27,284;00:35:29,784;of the gods
428;00:35:29,886;00:35:32,087;would please
428;00:35:29,886;00:35:32,087;each and every one of us.
429;00:35:32,189;00:35:34,522;We yearn for it.
430;00:35:43,567;00:35:46,067;But there is no call
430;00:35:43,567;00:35:46,067;for it today.
431;00:35:48,939;00:35:51,940;There will be no walk
431;00:35:48,939;00:35:51,940;of atonement.
432;00:36:08,325;00:36:10,325;Order up.
433;00:36:10,427;00:36:13,394;Queen Margaery has already
433;00:36:10,427;00:36:13,394;atoned for her sins
434;00:36:13,497;00:36:16,498;by bringing another
435;00:36:16,600;00:36:18,700;into the true light
435;00:36:16,600;00:36:18,700;of the Seven.
436;00:36:48,698;00:36:51,900;Together we announce
437;00:36:52,002;00:36:54,536;a new age of harmony.
438;00:36:55,572;00:36:57,505;A holy alliance
439;00:36:57,607;00:37:01,142;between the Crown
439;00:36:57,607;00:37:01,142;and the Faith.
440;00:37:16,293;00:37:20,295;Long live King Tommen
440;00:37:16,293;00:37:20,295;and bless you, Queen Margaery!
441;00:37:20,397;00:37:22,797;The Crown and the Faith
442;00:37:22,899;00:37:26,634;are the twin pillars
442;00:37:22,899;00:37:26,634;upon which the world rests.
443;00:37:26,736;00:37:31,840;Together we will restore
443;00:37:26,736;00:37:31,840;the Seven Kingdoms to glory.
444;00:37:50,227;00:37:52,360;What's happening?
445;00:37:52,462;00:37:54,462;He's beaten us.
446;00:37:54,564;00:37:56,431;That's what's happening.
447;00:38:11,314;00:38:14,315;When you attack the Faith,
447;00:38:11,314;00:38:14,315;you attack the Crown.
448;00:38:14,417;00:38:17,385;Anyone who attacks
448;00:38:14,417;00:38:17,385;the Crown is unfit
449;00:38:17,487;00:38:20,088;to serve as Lord Commander
449;00:38:17,487;00:38:20,088;of the Kingsguard.
450;00:38:20,190;00:38:24,125;I've been a member of the Kingsguard
450;00:38:20,190;00:38:24,125;since before you were born.
451;00:38:26,029;00:38:29,063;You don't have to do this.
451;00:38:26,029;00:38:29,063;You don't have to do anything.
452;00:38:31,468;00:38:33,401;I have to answer
452;00:38:31,468;00:38:33,401;to the gods.
453;00:38:33,503;00:38:35,737;Not when you're sitting
453;00:38:33,503;00:38:35,737;in that chair.
454;00:38:39,876;00:38:42,477;The Crown's decision
454;00:38:39,876;00:38:42,477;on this matter is final.
455;00:38:44,614;00:38:47,548;Will I be walking naked
455;00:38:44,614;00:38:47,548;in the streets?
456;00:38:47,651;00:38:50,151;Or will I spend a few months
456;00:38:47,651;00:38:50,151;in the Sept dungeons first
457;00:38:50,253;00:38:52,387;to teach me about
457;00:38:50,253;00:38:52,387;the gods' mercy?
458;00:38:56,593;00:39:00,895;You have served your house
458;00:38:56,593;00:39:00,895;and your king faithfully for many years.
459;00:39:00,997;00:39:03,231;And you will continue
459;00:39:00,997;00:39:03,231;to do so.
460;00:39:05,001;00:39:06,935;But not in this city.
461;00:39:10,206;00:39:13,574;You've lost it?
462;00:39:15,312;00:39:16,611;Yes, Father.
463;00:39:16,713;00:39:19,647;It's a castle,
463;00:39:16,713;00:39:19,647;not a bloody sheep.
464;00:39:19,749;00:39:22,917;Presumably you still
464;00:39:19,749;00:39:22,917;know where it is.
465;00:39:23,019;00:39:24,619;You didn't lose Riverrun.
466;00:39:24,721;00:39:26,854;You let the Blackfish
466;00:39:24,721;00:39:26,854;take it from you.
467;00:39:26,957;00:39:29,924;He surprised us. He knows the castle
467;00:39:26,957;00:39:29,924;better than anyone.
468;00:39:30,026;00:39:33,394;You did lose the Blackfish
468;00:39:30,026;00:39:33,394;after the Red Wedding.
469;00:39:33,496;00:39:36,497;You had him right here
469;00:39:33,496;00:39:36,497;in this hall and you let him leave.
470;00:39:36,599;00:39:39,100;Then when I told you
470;00:39:36,599;00:39:39,100;to hunt him down and kill him,
471;00:39:39,202;00:39:40,568;you couldn't find him.
472;00:39:40,670;00:39:42,770;That's what it means
472;00:39:40,670;00:39:42,770;to lose something.
473;00:39:42,872;00:39:46,307;Now he's come back
473;00:39:42,872;00:39:46,307;and taken Riverrun.
474;00:39:46,409;00:39:48,576;I don't think it's fair
474;00:39:46,409;00:39:48,576;to blame us--
475;00:39:48,678;00:39:51,946;For 300 years
475;00:39:48,678;00:39:51,946;we kissed Tully boots,
476;00:39:52,048;00:39:55,950;swore oaths to them
476;00:39:52,048;00:39:55,950;and their stinking fish banners.
477;00:39:56,052;00:39:58,286;Not again.
477;00:39:56,052;00:39:58,286;Riverrun is ours.
478;00:39:58,388;00:40:00,722;Take it back.
479;00:40:00,824;00:40:02,357;We don't have the men.
480;00:40:02,459;00:40:05,793;We've got 10 times as many men
480;00:40:02,459;00:40:05,793;as the damn Blackfish.
481;00:40:05,895;00:40:08,930;The Mallisters have risen
481;00:40:05,895;00:40:08,930;against us. And the Blackwoods.
482;00:40:09,032;00:40:12,233;The Brotherhood Without Banners
482;00:40:09,032;00:40:12,233;is rallying the commoners against us,
483;00:40:12,335;00:40:14,268;raiding our supply trains
483;00:40:12,335;00:40:14,268;and camps.
484;00:40:14,371;00:40:17,405;Riverrun can withstand
484;00:40:14,371;00:40:17,405;a siege for a year.
485;00:40:17,507;00:40:20,842;If I want excuses,
485;00:40:17,507;00:40:20,842;I'll put her in charge.
486;00:40:20,944;00:40:22,710;They're laughing at us.
487;00:40:22,812;00:40:24,679;All across
487;00:40:22,812;00:40:24,679;the Riverlands
488;00:40:24,781;00:40:26,514;right down
488;00:40:24,781;00:40:26,514;to King's Landing,
489;00:40:26,616;00:40:28,249;they're laughing at us.
490;00:40:28,351;00:40:30,885;I hear it in my sleep!
491;00:40:30,987;00:40:33,988;I'm not dead yet,
491;00:40:30,987;00:40:33,988;unfortunately for you.
492;00:40:34,090;00:40:38,826;And I'll not leave this world until they
492;00:40:34,090;00:40:38,826;all choke on that laughter.
493;00:40:38,928;00:40:41,462;Take that castle back.
494;00:40:42,932;00:40:45,433;He'll never yield,
494;00:40:42,932;00:40:45,433;Father.
495;00:40:45,535;00:40:48,036;Oh, he'll yield.
496;00:40:52,542;00:40:55,276;You'll show him
496;00:40:52,542;00:40:55,276;the knife you used
497;00:40:55,378;00:40:59,080;to kill Robb Stark's
497;00:40:55,378;00:40:59,080;child in his whore mother's belly,
498;00:40:59,182;00:41:01,449;and you'll show him
498;00:40:59,182;00:41:01,449;the knife you used
499;00:41:01,551;00:41:03,684;to open
499;00:41:01,551;00:41:03,684;his niece's throat.
500;00:41:03,787;00:41:05,753;And you'll remind him
500;00:41:03,787;00:41:05,753;who it was
501;00:41:05,855;00:41:09,724;that got married
501;00:41:05,855;00:41:09,724;at the Red Wedding in the first place.
502;00:41:09,826;00:41:11,492;His nephew.
503;00:41:26,743;00:41:29,377;Cheer up, Lord Edmure.
504;00:41:29,479;00:41:31,546;You're going home.
505;00:41:31,648;00:41:35,149;I'm being sent to deal
505;00:41:31,648;00:41:35,149;with the Blackfish.
506;00:41:35,251;00:41:38,119;Apparently Walder Frey
506;00:41:35,251;00:41:38,119;can't manage it on his own
507;00:41:38,221;00:41:40,021;because he's
507;00:41:38,221;00:41:40,021;400 years old.
508;00:41:40,123;00:41:42,623;Sent me with an army
508;00:41:40,123;00:41:42,623;to the Riverlands
509;00:41:42,725;00:41:44,592;and a siege
509;00:41:42,725;00:41:44,592;that could last months.
510;00:41:44,694;00:41:47,128;Better you're elsewhere
510;00:41:44,694;00:41:47,128;at the head of an army
511;00:41:47,230;00:41:48,796;than in the Sept dungeons.
512;00:41:48,898;00:41:51,766;I'm not going
512;00:41:48,898;00:41:51,766;to the Riverlands.
513;00:41:54,838;00:41:56,070;What, then?
514;00:41:56,172;00:41:57,605;I'm going to give Bronn
515;00:41:57,707;00:41:59,774;the largest bag of gold
515;00:41:57,707;00:41:59,774;anyone's ever seen
516;00:41:59,876;00:42:03,244;and have him gather
516;00:41:59,876;00:42:03,244;the best killers he knows.
517;00:42:03,346;00:42:06,714;I'll take them to the Sept and
517;00:42:03,346;00:42:06,714;I'll remove the High Sparrow's head
518;00:42:06,816;00:42:08,649;and every other
518;00:42:06,816;00:42:08,649;sparrow head I can find.
519;00:42:08,751;00:42:12,320;You can't.
519;00:42:08,751;00:42:12,320;He has our son! He stole our son!
520;00:42:12,422;00:42:14,422;He's torn
520;00:42:12,422;00:42:14,422;our family apart.
521;00:42:14,524;00:42:16,858;How should we treat people
521;00:42:14,524;00:42:16,858;who tear us apart?
522;00:42:16,960;00:42:21,028;We should treat them
522;00:42:16,960;00:42:21,028;without mercy and we will.
523;00:42:21,131;00:42:23,965;But if you kill the High Sparrow,
523;00:42:21,131;00:42:23,965;you won't leave the Sept alive.
524;00:42:24,067;00:42:27,101;And without you,
524;00:42:24,067;00:42:27,101;this is all for nothing.
525;00:42:27,203;00:42:30,571;Stand at the head of our army
525;00:42:27,203;00:42:30,571;where you belong,
526;00:42:30,673;00:42:32,974;where Father wanted you.
527;00:42:33,076;00:42:35,443;Show our men where
527;00:42:33,076;00:42:35,443;their loyalties belong.
528;00:42:35,545;00:42:37,545;Show them
528;00:42:35,545;00:42:37,545;what Lannisters are,
529;00:42:37,647;00:42:39,580;what we do
529;00:42:37,647;00:42:39,580;to our enemies.
530;00:42:40,950;00:42:43,184;And take that stupid
530;00:42:40,950;00:42:43,184;little castle back
531;00:42:43,286;00:42:45,486;because it's ours
531;00:42:43,286;00:42:45,486;and because you can.
532;00:42:45,588;00:42:48,689;You'll stand trial soon.
532;00:42:45,588;00:42:48,689;I need to be here for you.
533;00:42:48,791;00:42:52,960;It will be a trial
533;00:42:48,791;00:42:52,960;by combat.
534;00:42:53,062;00:42:55,429;I have the Mountain.
535;00:42:57,667;00:43:00,334;They've made us
535;00:42:57,667;00:43:00,334;both stronger, all of them.
536;00:43:01,704;00:43:03,738;They have no idea
536;00:43:01,704;00:43:03,738;how strong we are.
537;00:43:03,840;00:43:06,140;No idea what we're going
537;00:43:03,840;00:43:06,140;to do to them.
538;00:43:16,753;00:43:19,153;We've always
538;00:43:16,753;00:43:19,153;been together.
539;00:43:19,255;00:43:21,822;We'll always
539;00:43:19,255;00:43:21,822;be together.
540;00:43:21,925;00:43:24,358;We're the only two
540;00:43:21,925;00:43:24,358;people in the world.
541;00:43:44,314;00:43:46,147;Why did you help us?
542;00:43:49,686;00:43:51,185;The Three-Eyed Raven
542;00:43:49,686;00:43:51,185;sent for me.
543;00:43:51,287;00:43:52,486;The Three-Eyed
543;00:43:51,287;00:43:52,486;Raven's dead.
544;00:43:52,589;00:43:54,655;Now he lives again.
545;00:44:07,337;00:44:10,037;When I last saw you,
545;00:44:07,337;00:44:10,037;you were a boy.
546;00:44:11,741;00:44:13,307;A fearless boy.
547;00:44:13,409;00:44:16,477;Loved to climb the castle walls,
547;00:44:13,409;00:44:16,477;frighten his mother.
548;00:44:16,579;00:44:18,980;Who are you?
549;00:44:36,499;00:44:38,266;Uncle Benjen.
550;00:44:39,669;00:44:41,102;The last letter
550;00:44:39,669;00:44:41,102;Jon wrote me
551;00:44:41,204;00:44:43,037;said you had been
551;00:44:41,204;00:44:43,037;lost beyond the Wall.
552;00:44:46,042;00:44:48,609;I led a ranging party
552;00:44:46,042;00:44:48,609;deep into the North
553;00:44:48,711;00:44:51,445;to find white walkers.
554;00:44:51,547;00:44:53,147;They found us.
555;00:44:53,249;00:44:57,084;A white walker stabbed me in the gut
555;00:44:53,249;00:44:57,084;with a sword of ice.
556;00:44:59,422;00:45:01,088;Left me there to die.
557;00:45:01,190;00:45:02,590;To turn.
558;00:45:02,692;00:45:05,259;The Children found me.
559;00:45:05,361;00:45:08,562;Stopped the walker's
559;00:45:05,361;00:45:08,562;magic from taking hold.
560;00:45:08,665;00:45:09,964;How?
561;00:45:10,066;00:45:12,366;The same way they made the walkers
561;00:45:10,066;00:45:12,366;in the first place.
562;00:45:12,468;00:45:13,801;You saw it yourself.
563;00:45:15,605;00:45:17,605;Dragonglass.
564;00:45:17,707;00:45:20,708;A shard of dragonglass
564;00:45:17,707;00:45:20,708;plunged into your heart.
565;00:45:22,979;00:45:25,713;You are the Three-Eyed
565;00:45:22,979;00:45:25,713;Raven now.
566;00:45:25,815;00:45:28,749;I didn't have time to learn.
566;00:45:25,815;00:45:28,749;I can't control anything.
567;00:45:31,788;00:45:33,821;You must learn
567;00:45:31,788;00:45:33,821;to control it
568;00:45:33,923;00:45:35,823;before
568;00:45:33,923;00:45:35,823;the Night King comes.
569;00:45:38,294;00:45:40,094;Drink.
570;00:45:42,231;00:45:45,299;One way or another,
571;00:45:45,401;00:45:48,102;he will find his way
571;00:45:45,401;00:45:48,102;to the world of men.
572;00:45:48,204;00:45:50,604;When he does,
573;00:45:50,707;00:45:53,874;you will be there
573;00:45:50,707;00:45:53,874;waiting for him.
574;00:45:53,976;00:45:57,244;And you will be ready.
575;00:46:17,590;00:46:20,057;Everything all right?
576;00:46:20,159;00:46:22,193;How many days' ride
576;00:46:20,159;00:46:22,193;to Meereen?
577;00:46:22,295;00:46:24,128;A week at best.
578;00:46:24,230;00:46:27,632;How many ships will I need to bring
578;00:46:24,230;00:46:27,632;my khalasar to Westeros?
579;00:46:27,734;00:46:29,834;Dothraki
579;00:46:27,734;00:46:29,834;and all their horses,
580;00:46:29,936;00:46:32,270;the Unsullied,
580;00:46:29,936;00:46:32,270;the Second Sons--
581;00:46:32,372;00:46:34,238;1,000 ships easily.
582;00:46:34,340;00:46:36,474;Probably more.
582;00:46:34,340;00:46:36,474;And who has that many?
583;00:46:36,576;00:46:38,075;Nobody.
584;00:46:38,177;00:46:40,211;Nobody yet.
585;00:46:42,282;00:46:45,783;So we ride for Meereen
585;00:46:42,282;00:46:45,783;and after that we sail for Westeros.
586;00:46:45,885;00:46:47,385;And what then?
587;00:46:47,487;00:46:50,254;I take what is mine.
588;00:46:50,356;00:46:53,190;You weren't made to sit
588;00:46:50,356;00:46:53,190;on a chair in a palace.
589;00:46:53,293;00:46:55,626;What was I made for?
590;00:46:55,728;00:46:59,397;You're a conqueror,
590;00:46:55,728;00:46:59,397;Daenerys Stormborn.
