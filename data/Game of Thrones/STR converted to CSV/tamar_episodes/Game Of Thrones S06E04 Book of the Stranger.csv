3;00:02:15,682;00:02:17,598;Where you gonna go?
4;00:02:19,152;00:02:20,318;South.
5;00:02:20,403;00:02:23,354;What are you gonna do?
6;00:02:23,490;00:02:25,189;Get warm.
7;00:02:32,532;00:02:34,749;I was with you
7;00:02:32,532;00:02:34,749;at Hardhome.
8;00:02:36,035;00:02:38,369;We saw
8;00:02:36,035;00:02:38,369;what's out there.
9;00:02:38,505;00:02:39,871;We know
9;00:02:38,505;00:02:39,871;it's coming here.
10;00:02:39,956;00:02:42,373;How can you
10;00:02:39,956;00:02:42,373;leave us now?
11;00:02:42,509;00:02:45,009;I did everything I could.
11;00:02:42,509;00:02:45,009;You know that.
12;00:02:45,094;00:02:46,343;You swore a vow.
13;00:02:46,367;00:02:48,367;Aye, I pledged my life
13;00:02:46,367;00:02:48,367;to the Night's Watch.
14;00:02:48,681;00:02:50,431;I gave my life.
14;00:02:48,681;00:02:50,431;For all nights to come.
15;00:02:50,550;00:02:52,967;They killed me, Edd!
15;00:02:50,550;00:02:52,967;My own brothers.
16;00:02:53,052;00:02:54,936;You want me
16;00:02:53,052;00:02:54,936;to stay here after that?
17;00:02:55,054;00:02:58,556;Riders approaching!
18;00:02:58,691;00:03:00,725;Open the gate!
19;00:04:34,454;00:04:36,320;This is good soup.
20;00:04:38,825;00:04:41,959;Do you remember those kidney pies
20;00:04:38,825;00:04:41,959;Old Nan used to make?
21;00:04:42,045;00:04:44,629;With the peas and onions?
21;00:04:42,045;00:04:44,629;Mmm.
22;00:04:47,333;00:04:50,251;We never should
22;00:04:47,333;00:04:50,251;have left Winterfell.
23;00:04:50,336;00:04:53,137;Don't you wish we could
23;00:04:50,336;00:04:53,137;go back to the day we left?
24;00:04:55,091;00:04:58,809;I want to scream at myself,
24;00:04:55,091;00:04:58,809;Don't go, you idiot.
25;00:04:58,895;00:05:00,978;How could we know?
26;00:05:01,064;00:05:05,182;I spent a lot of time thinking about
26;00:05:01,064;00:05:05,182;what an ass I was to you.
27;00:05:07,153;00:05:09,186;I wish I could
27;00:05:07,153;00:05:09,186;change everything.
28;00:05:09,322;00:05:10,438;We were children.
29;00:05:10,523;00:05:12,156;I was awful,
29;00:05:10,523;00:05:12,156;just admit it.
30;00:05:14,360;00:05:16,744;You were
30;00:05:14,360;00:05:16,744;occasionally awful.
31;00:05:16,863;00:05:18,663;I'm sure I can't
31;00:05:16,863;00:05:18,663;have been great fun.
32;00:05:18,748;00:05:21,532;Always sulking in the corner
32;00:05:18,748;00:05:21,532;while the rest of you played.
33;00:05:21,618;00:05:23,451;Can you forgive me?
33;00:05:21,618;00:05:23,451;There's nothing to forgive.
34;00:05:23,536;00:05:25,536;Forgive me.
34;00:05:23,536;00:05:25,536;All right.
35;00:05:25,672;00:05:27,672;All right,
35;00:05:25,672;00:05:27,672;I forgive you.
36;00:05:44,974;00:05:46,857;You'd think after
36;00:05:44,974;00:05:46,857;thousands of years,
37;00:05:46,943;00:05:49,527;the Night's Watch would have learned
37;00:05:46,943;00:05:49,527;how to make a good ale.
38;00:05:52,615;00:05:54,231;Where will you go?
39;00:05:55,985;00:05:58,569;Where will we go?
40;00:05:58,655;00:05:59,807;If I don't watch over you,
41;00:05:59,832;00:06:01,653;Father's ghost will come
41;00:05:59,832;00:06:01,653;back and murder me.
42;00:06:04,744;00:06:06,377;Where will we go?
43;00:06:06,462;00:06:08,963;I can't stay here,
43;00:06:06,462;00:06:08,963;not after what happened.
44;00:06:09,082;00:06:11,082;There's only one place
44;00:06:09,082;00:06:11,082;we can go.
45;00:06:11,217;00:06:13,300;Home.
46;00:06:14,587;00:06:16,637;Should we tell the Boltons
46;00:06:14,587;00:06:16,637;to pack up and leave?
47;00:06:16,756;00:06:18,389;We'll take it back
47;00:06:16,756;00:06:18,389;from them.
48;00:06:21,477;00:06:22,810;I don't have an army.
49;00:06:22,929;00:06:25,012;How many wildlings
49;00:06:22,929;00:06:25,012;did you save?
50;00:06:25,098;00:06:26,731;They didn't come here
50;00:06:25,098;00:06:26,731;to serve me.
51;00:06:26,816;00:06:29,100;They owe you
51;00:06:26,816;00:06:29,100;their lives.
52;00:06:29,185;00:06:32,353;You think they'll be safe here if
52;00:06:29,185;00:06:32,353;Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?
53;00:06:32,438;00:06:34,822;Sansa.
53;00:06:32,438;00:06:34,822;Winterfell is our home.
54;00:06:34,941;00:06:38,442;It's ours and Arya's
54;00:06:34,941;00:06:38,442;and Bran's and Rickon's.
55;00:06:38,528;00:06:40,661;Wherever they are,
55;00:06:38,528;00:06:40,661;it belongs to our family.
56;00:06:40,780;00:06:42,113;We have to fight for it.
57;00:06:42,198;00:06:44,331;I'm tired of fighting.
58;00:06:46,252;00:06:49,120;It's all I've done
58;00:06:46,252;00:06:49,120;since I left home.
59;00:06:49,205;00:06:51,122;I've killed brothers
59;00:06:49,205;00:06:51,122;of the Night's Watch.
60;00:06:51,257;00:06:53,924;I've killed wildlings.
60;00:06:51,257;00:06:53,924;I've killed men that I admire.
61;00:06:54,010;00:06:57,461;I hanged a boy
61;00:06:54,010;00:06:57,461;younger than Bran.
62;00:06:59,966;00:07:04,301;I fought and I lost.
63;00:07:08,141;00:07:11,642;If we don't take back the North,
63;00:07:08,141;00:07:11,642;we'll never be safe.
64;00:07:13,446;00:07:15,529;I want you to help me.
65;00:07:17,033;00:07:19,650;But I'll do it myself
65;00:07:17,033;00:07:19,650;if I have to.
66;00:07:22,705;00:07:24,872;My lady.
67;00:07:25,958;00:07:27,575;Ser Davos.
68;00:07:29,495;00:07:32,580;Will you stay here
68;00:07:29,495;00:07:32,580;at Castle Black?
69;00:07:32,665;00:07:36,417;I will do
69;00:07:32,665;00:07:36,417;as Jon Snow commands.
70;00:07:36,502;00:07:38,335;You serve Jon Snow now?
71;00:07:39,672;00:07:41,722;He's the prince
71;00:07:39,672;00:07:41,722;that was promised.
72;00:07:43,476;00:07:46,227;Forgive me, my lady, I thought
72;00:07:43,476;00:07:46,227;that was Stannis.
73;00:07:56,189;00:07:58,322;What happened
73;00:07:56,189;00:07:58,322;down there?
74;00:08:00,576;00:08:03,577;There was a battle.
74;00:08:00,576;00:08:03,577;Stannis was defeated.
75;00:08:05,581;00:08:07,698;And Shireen?
76;00:08:07,834;00:08:09,366;What happened
76;00:08:07,834;00:08:09,366;to the princess?
77;00:08:09,452;00:08:12,169;I saw what happened.
78;00:08:12,255;00:08:15,089;I saw Stannis' forces
78;00:08:12,255;00:08:15,089;defeated in the field.
79;00:08:15,208;00:08:17,091;My lady,
79;00:08:15,208;00:08:17,091;I'm Ser Davos Seaworth.
80;00:08:17,210;00:08:18,793;We've met before.
81;00:08:18,878;00:08:20,628;I was Kingsguard
81;00:08:18,878;00:08:20,628;to Renly Baratheon.
82;00:08:20,713;00:08:24,882;Before Renly was assassinated
82;00:08:20,713;00:08:24,882;with bloodmagic.
83;00:08:26,102;00:08:27,685;That's in the past now.
84;00:08:29,222;00:08:30,971;Yes, it's in the past.
85;00:08:31,057;00:08:33,607;It doesn't mean
85;00:08:31,057;00:08:33,607;I forget.
86;00:08:35,394;00:08:36,694;Or forgive.
87;00:08:38,564;00:08:40,197;He admitted it,
87;00:08:38,564;00:08:40,197;you know.
88;00:08:40,283;00:08:42,066;Who did?
89;00:08:42,201;00:08:44,235;Stannis.
90;00:08:44,370;00:08:46,487;Just before
90;00:08:44,370;00:08:46,487;I executed him.
91;00:09:32,285;00:09:34,451;The Defender of the Vale!
92;00:09:34,587;00:09:36,203;Uncle Petyr!
93;00:09:43,129;00:09:44,678;My lord.
94;00:09:44,797;00:09:46,347;Come and see.
95;00:09:46,465;00:09:49,099;I missed your name day.
95;00:09:46,465;00:09:49,099;Go on.
96;00:09:50,386;00:09:53,470;A falcon!
97;00:09:53,606;00:09:54,972;A gyrfalcon.
98;00:09:55,057;00:09:56,523;The greatest and rarest
98;00:09:55,057;00:09:56,523;of birds.
99;00:09:56,642;00:09:59,310;Last time
99;00:09:56,642;00:09:59,310;I saw you, Baelish,
100;00:09:59,445;00:10:03,647;you told me you were taking
100;00:09:59,445;00:10:03,647;Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers.
101;00:10:03,733;00:10:04,982;Indeed I was.
102;00:10:05,117;00:10:07,318;And yet not long ago,
102;00:10:05,117;00:10:07,318;we received reports
103;00:10:07,403;00:10:10,487;that she has been married to
103;00:10:07,403;00:10:10,487;Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell.
104;00:10:10,623;00:10:11,680;On our way to the Fingers,
105;00:10:11,704;00:10:14,027;we were set upon by a large
105;00:10:11,704;00:10:14,027;force of Bolton men.
106;00:10:14,293;00:10:16,056;Seemed to know exactly when
107;00:10:16,080;00:10:18,397;we were traveling and exactly
107;00:10:16,080;00:10:18,397;whom we were transporting.
108;00:10:18,831;00:10:20,547;Do you take me
108;00:10:18,831;00:10:20,547;for a fool?
109;00:10:20,666;00:10:23,500;Tell me, Lord Royce,
110;00:10:23,636;00:10:27,004;how many people knew
110;00:10:23,636;00:10:27,004;of my travel plans with Sansa Stark?
111;00:10:27,089;00:10:30,391;I shared my intentions
111;00:10:27,089;00:10:30,391;with you
112;00:10:30,509;00:10:32,643;and no one else.
113;00:10:32,728;00:10:36,513;Slander a man
113;00:10:32,728;00:10:36,513;in his own home,
114;00:10:36,599;00:10:39,400;you might find yourself
114;00:10:36,599;00:10:39,400;crossing swords with him.
115;00:10:39,518;00:10:44,154;Your home is the Vale.
115;00:10:39,518;00:10:44,154;The Lord of the Vale stands before us.
116;00:10:44,240;00:10:47,024;And only his judgment
116;00:10:44,240;00:10:47,024;concerns me.
117;00:10:52,949;00:10:55,115;Shall we throw him
117;00:10:52,949;00:10:55,115;through the Moon Door?
118;00:11:02,208;00:11:04,291;My lord.
119;00:11:04,377;00:11:08,963;My lord, I have always been
119;00:11:04,377;00:11:08,963;faithful to House Arryn.
120;00:11:09,048;00:11:12,049;To your father, to your mother,
120;00:11:09,048;00:11:12,049;and now to you.
121;00:11:13,386;00:11:14,635;Do you believe him,
121;00:11:13,386;00:11:14,635;Uncle Petyr?
122;00:11:22,945;00:11:26,063;Lord Royce has served
122;00:11:22,945;00:11:26,063;the Vale well.
123;00:11:26,148;00:11:29,900;He's enjoyed a distinguished
123;00:11:26,148;00:11:29,900;military career.
124;00:11:29,986;00:11:33,537;If we could trust
124;00:11:29,986;00:11:33,537;his absolute loyalty,
125;00:11:33,622;00:11:36,206;he would make a capable commander
125;00:11:33,622;00:11:36,206;in the wars to come.
126;00:11:39,795;00:11:43,297;You can trust my absolute loyalty,
126;00:11:39,795;00:11:43,297;my lord.
127;00:11:43,416;00:11:46,216;I think he deserves one more chance.
127;00:11:43,416;00:11:46,216;What do you say?
128;00:11:53,175;00:11:54,808;Fine.
129;00:12:02,101;00:12:04,351;I bring good news.
130;00:12:04,437;00:12:07,021;My friends in the North
130;00:12:04,437;00:12:07,021;tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell.
131;00:12:07,106;00:12:08,906;I expect she's headed
131;00:12:07,106;00:12:08,906;to Castle Black
132;00:12:08,991;00:12:11,325;where her brother serves
132;00:12:08,991;00:12:11,325;as Lord Commander.
133;00:12:11,444;00:12:15,612;But she won't be safe there,
133;00:12:11,444;00:12:15,612;not with the Boltons after her.
134;00:12:17,666;00:12:19,533;She's my cousin.
135;00:12:22,288;00:12:23,370;We should help her.
136;00:12:23,456;00:12:26,123;That was my instinct
136;00:12:23,456;00:12:26,123;as well.
137;00:12:26,258;00:12:28,792;Our lord has spoken.
138;00:12:30,379;00:12:32,296;Gather the Knights
138;00:12:30,379;00:12:32,296;of the Vale.
139;00:12:32,431;00:12:35,466;The time has come
139;00:12:32,431;00:12:35,466;to join the fray.
140;00:12:39,688;00:12:41,805;You invite the enemy
140;00:12:39,688;00:12:41,805;into our city?
141;00:12:41,941;00:12:43,607;I did.
142;00:12:43,692;00:12:46,143;As a clever man
142;00:12:43,692;00:12:46,143;once told me,
143;00:12:46,278;00:12:48,946;We make peace with our enemies,
143;00:12:46,278;00:12:48,946;not our friends.
144;00:12:49,031;00:12:51,982;I don't make peace
144;00:12:49,031;00:12:51,982;with the queen's enemies.
145;00:12:52,118;00:12:53,200;I kill
145;00:12:52,118;00:12:53,200;the queen's enemies.
146;00:12:53,319;00:12:54,785;Yes, that's
146;00:12:53,319;00:12:54,785;the military approach.
147;00:12:54,870;00:12:56,453;And how has that worked
147;00:12:54,870;00:12:56,453;here in Meereen?
148;00:12:56,539;00:12:58,822;I represent
148;00:12:56,539;00:12:58,822;the diplomatic approach.
149;00:12:58,958;00:13:01,075;Our queen tried to make
149;00:12:58,958;00:13:01,075;peace with the Masters
150;00:13:01,160;00:13:03,160;and they tried
150;00:13:01,160;00:13:03,160;to murder her.
151;00:13:03,245;00:13:06,163;We enter these negotiations
151;00:13:03,245;00:13:06,163;with open eyes.
152;00:13:06,298;00:13:09,583;Trust me. My own recent
152;00:13:06,298;00:13:09,583;experience with slavery
153;00:13:09,668;00:13:11,585;has taught me the horrors
153;00:13:09,668;00:13:11,585;of that institution.
154;00:13:11,670;00:13:13,087;How many days
154;00:13:11,670;00:13:13,087;were you a slave?
155;00:13:13,172;00:13:15,172;Long enough to know.
156;00:13:15,257;00:13:18,308;Not long enough
156;00:13:15,257;00:13:18,308;to understand.
157;00:13:23,816;00:13:28,352;I bought this dwarf
157;00:13:23,816;00:13:28,352;for a single gold honor.
158;00:13:28,487;00:13:30,521;And somehow you've risen
159;00:13:30,656;00:13:33,524;to the top of the
159;00:13:30,656;00:13:33,524;Great Pyramid of Meereen.
160;00:13:33,659;00:13:35,442;It's most impressive.
161;00:13:35,528;00:13:38,362;And now you speak
161;00:13:35,528;00:13:38,362;for the Good Masters of Astapor.
162;00:13:38,497;00:13:40,831;Here's to reversals
162;00:13:38,497;00:13:40,831;of fortune.
163;00:13:40,916;00:13:42,499;We came here
163;00:13:40,916;00:13:42,499;to meet the queen
164;00:13:42,585;00:13:45,002;and instead we're greeted
164;00:13:42,585;00:13:45,002;by a dwarf and a eunuch.
165;00:13:45,087;00:13:48,872;Let's make this simple, shall we?
165;00:13:45,087;00:13:48,872;Tell me what you want.
166;00:13:49,008;00:13:51,925;We want you to leave
166;00:13:49,008;00:13:51,925;Slaver's Bay.
167;00:13:52,044;00:13:55,712;Take your dragons
167;00:13:52,044;00:13:55,712;and your mercenaries and go.
168;00:13:55,848;00:13:58,382;Queen Daenerys won't stay
168;00:13:55,848;00:13:58,382;in Meereen forever.
169;00:13:58,517;00:14:00,267;Her path takes
169;00:13:58,517;00:14:00,267;her westward.
170;00:14:00,386;00:14:02,719;When we last met,
170;00:14:00,386;00:14:02,719;I offered her ships
171;00:14:02,805;00:14:06,690;so she could return to Westeros
171;00:14:02,805;00:14:06,690;where she belongs. She refused them.
172;00:14:06,775;00:14:08,892;She refused them because
172;00:14:06,775;00:14:08,892;hundreds of thousands
173;00:14:08,978;00:14:10,944;of men, women, and children
173;00:14:08,978;00:14:10,944;still lived in chains.
174;00:14:11,063;00:14:13,480;As they have
174;00:14:11,063;00:14:13,480;since the dawn of time.
175;00:14:13,566;00:14:16,733;Not anymore.
175;00:14:13,566;00:14:16,733;You think you're a free man now?
176;00:14:16,869;00:14:18,702;You still follow orders.
177;00:14:18,787;00:14:21,321;Just because your master
177;00:14:18,787;00:14:21,321;has silver hair and tits
178;00:14:21,407;00:14:23,157;doesn't mean
178;00:14:21,407;00:14:23,157;she's not a master.
179;00:14:23,242;00:14:26,710;Friends, friends,
179;00:14:23,242;00:14:26,710;friends, please.
180;00:14:26,795;00:14:28,211;There have always been
181;00:14:28,235;00:14:31,163;those with wealth and power
181;00:14:28,235;00:14:31,163;and those with nothing.
182;00:14:31,417;00:14:32,513;That is the way of the world.
183;00:14:32,537;00:14:34,537;I'm not here to change
183;00:14:32,537;00:14:34,537;the way of the world.
184;00:14:34,553;00:14:37,004;Slavery is the way
184;00:14:34,553;00:14:37,004;of our world.
185;00:14:37,089;00:14:40,591;You don't need slaves
185;00:14:37,089;00:14:40,591;to make money.
186;00:14:40,676;00:14:43,560;There haven't been slaves in Westeros
186;00:14:40,676;00:14:43,560;for hundreds of years
187;00:14:43,646;00:14:45,596;and I grew up richer
187;00:14:43,646;00:14:45,596;than any of you.
188;00:14:47,600;00:14:51,268;But our queen recognizes
188;00:14:47,600;00:14:51,268;that she erred
189;00:14:51,403;00:14:54,021;by abolishing slavery
190;00:14:54,106;00:14:56,940;without providing
190;00:14:54,106;00:14:56,940;a new system to replace it.
191;00:14:57,076;00:15:00,827;So here
191;00:14:57,076;00:15:00,827;is the queen's proposal.
192;00:15:00,946;00:15:03,780;Slavery will never
192;00:15:00,946;00:15:03,780;return to Meereen,
193;00:15:03,916;00:15:06,617;but she will give
193;00:15:03,916;00:15:06,617;the other cities of Slaver's Bay
194;00:15:06,752;00:15:08,702;time to adjust
194;00:15:06,752;00:15:08,702;to the new order.
195;00:15:08,787;00:15:10,120;What does that mean?
196;00:15:10,206;00:15:13,340;Instead of abolishing
196;00:15:10,206;00:15:13,340;slavery overnight,
197;00:15:13,459;00:15:16,176;we will give you seven years
197;00:15:13,459;00:15:16,176;to end the practice.
198;00:15:21,300;00:15:23,133;Slaveholders
198;00:15:21,300;00:15:23,133;will be compensated
199;00:15:23,219;00:15:25,969;for their losses,
199;00:15:23,219;00:15:25,969;of course, at fair prices.
200;00:15:26,055;00:15:28,555;In exchange,
200;00:15:26,055;00:15:28,555;you will cut off
201;00:15:28,641;00:15:30,390;your support for
201;00:15:28,641;00:15:30,390;the Sons of the Harpy.
202;00:15:30,476;00:15:32,036;We do not support
202;00:15:30,476;00:15:32,036;the Sons of the Harpy.
203;00:15:32,144;00:15:35,195;Fine, fine, but you will
203;00:15:32,144;00:15:35,195;cut it off all the same.
204;00:15:36,365;00:15:39,316;I do hope you accept,
204;00:15:36,365;00:15:39,316;my friends.
205;00:15:39,451;00:15:41,318;You will not receive
205;00:15:39,451;00:15:41,318;a better offer.
206;00:15:44,790;00:15:47,624;Let us sail
206;00:15:44,790;00:15:47,624;on the tide of freedom
207;00:15:47,710;00:15:49,960;instead of being
207;00:15:47,710;00:15:49,960;drowned by it.
208;00:15:51,330;00:15:54,414;And as a parting gift
208;00:15:51,330;00:15:54,414;to our honored guests...
209;00:16:03,392;00:16:05,175;Give freedom a chance.
210;00:16:05,311;00:16:08,645;See if it doesn't taste every bit as good
210;00:16:05,311;00:16:08,645;as what came before.
211;00:16:29,668;00:16:31,585;Perhaps I should
211;00:16:29,668;00:16:31,585;translate for you.
212;00:16:31,704;00:16:33,287;We speak
212;00:16:31,704;00:16:33,287;the Common Tongue.
213;00:16:33,372;00:16:36,873;Excellent.
213;00:16:33,372;00:16:36,873;You met with the slavers today.
214;00:16:36,959;00:16:38,375;I did.
215;00:16:38,460;00:16:40,460;Our brothers and sisters
215;00:16:38,460;00:16:40,460;died fighting this scum.
216;00:16:40,546;00:16:43,714;Now you invite them
216;00:16:40,546;00:16:43,714;to our city and drink wine with them.
217;00:16:46,385;00:16:49,803;I imagine
217;00:16:46,385;00:16:49,803;this room was built
218;00:16:49,888;00:16:52,939;so the rulers could
218;00:16:49,888;00:16:52,939;intimidate the ruled.
219;00:16:54,059;00:16:56,810;But I am not your ruler.
220;00:16:56,895;00:16:59,229;I'm not
220;00:16:56,895;00:16:59,229;the Breaker of Chains.
221;00:16:59,315;00:17:01,481;I'm not the Unburnt.
222;00:17:01,567;00:17:05,786;And I am certainly not
222;00:17:01,567;00:17:05,786;the Mother of Dragons.
223;00:17:05,904;00:17:07,904;You are a stranger here.
224;00:17:08,040;00:17:10,957;So why do you represent
224;00:17:08,040;00:17:10,957;Meereen in these talks with our enemies?
225;00:17:11,076;00:17:14,494;Because our queen
225;00:17:11,076;00:17:14,494;chose me as her advisor.
226;00:17:14,580;00:17:16,713;Until she returns
226;00:17:14,580;00:17:16,713;from her travels--
227;00:17:16,799;00:17:18,298;When does she return?
228;00:17:18,417;00:17:20,834;Soon.
228;00:17:18,417;00:17:20,834;You have my word.
229;00:17:20,919;00:17:24,588;We don't know you. We don't trust you.
229;00:17:20,919;00:17:24,588;We know Torgo Nudho.
230;00:17:24,723;00:17:26,640;We fight with him
230;00:17:24,723;00:17:26,640;against the Masters. We trust him.
231;00:17:26,759;00:17:30,594;And that is exactly why Grey Worm
231;00:17:26,759;00:17:30,594;took part in these negotiations.
232;00:17:30,679;00:17:34,314;As commander of the Unsullied,
232;00:17:30,679;00:17:34,314;he knows how to defeat the slavers
233;00:17:34,433;00:17:36,149;and he knows when
233;00:17:34,433;00:17:36,149;it is time to make peace.
234;00:17:36,268;00:17:39,102;You have made peace
234;00:17:36,268;00:17:39,102;with the slavers?
235;00:17:39,238;00:17:40,687;We offered terms.
236;00:18:33,041;00:18:36,460;Do not use me for your lies.
236;00:18:33,041;00:18:36,460;Those men respect you.
237;00:18:36,545;00:18:38,829;They respect me
237;00:18:36,545;00:18:38,829;because they know who I am.
238;00:18:38,964;00:18:40,964;They know I am loyal.
238;00:18:38,964;00:18:40,964;As do I.
239;00:18:41,049;00:18:43,333;I am loyal to my queen,
239;00:18:41,049;00:18:43,333;not you.
240;00:18:43,419;00:18:45,302;If you betray her work,
240;00:18:43,419;00:18:45,302;you are my enemy.
241;00:18:45,387;00:18:48,505;I am not betraying her work.
241;00:18:45,387;00:18:48,505;I am trying to save her city.
242;00:18:48,640;00:18:51,057;You promised the slavers
242;00:18:48,640;00:18:51,057;they could keep slavery.
243;00:18:51,176;00:18:52,342;For a short time.
244;00:18:52,478;00:18:55,178;Seven years is not a short time
244;00:18:52,478;00:18:55,178;for a slave.
245;00:18:55,314;00:18:56,763;You're right.
246;00:18:56,849;00:18:59,316;Slavery is a horror
246;00:18:56,849;00:18:59,316;that should be ended at once.
247;00:18:59,401;00:19:01,935;War is a horror that should be ended
247;00:18:59,401;00:19:01,935;at once.
248;00:19:02,020;00:19:03,687;I can't do both today.
249;00:19:03,822;00:19:05,238;You are wrong
249;00:19:03,822;00:19:05,238;to trust these men.
250;00:19:05,357;00:19:08,775;I don't trust the Masters.
250;00:19:05,357;00:19:08,775;I trust their self-interest.
251;00:19:08,861;00:19:10,527;They're trustworthy
251;00:19:08,861;00:19:10,527;if they're convinced
252;00:19:10,662;00:19:12,829;that working with me
252;00:19:10,662;00:19:12,829;is in their self-interest.
253;00:19:12,915;00:19:15,782;You don't know them.
253;00:19:12,915;00:19:15,782;You don't understand them.
254;00:19:15,868;00:19:17,534;We are not human
254;00:19:15,868;00:19:17,534;in their eyes.
255;00:19:17,669;00:19:19,920;They look at me
255;00:19:17,669;00:19:19,920;and see a weapon.
256;00:19:20,038;00:19:22,038;They look at her
256;00:19:20,038;00:19:22,038;and see a whore.
257;00:19:22,124;00:19:24,875;They look at me and they see
257;00:19:22,124;00:19:24,875;a misshapen little beast.
258;00:19:25,010;00:19:27,043;Their contempt
258;00:19:25,010;00:19:27,043;is their weakness.
259;00:19:27,129;00:19:30,630;They'll underestimate us every time
259;00:19:27,129;00:19:30,630;and we will use that to our advantage.
260;00:19:31,884;00:19:33,800;You will not use them.
261;00:19:33,886;00:19:36,603;They will use you.
261;00:19:33,886;00:19:36,603;That is what they do.
262;00:19:57,459;00:19:59,376;You all right?
263;00:19:59,461;00:20:02,712;Why don't you sit
263;00:19:59,461;00:20:02,712;and catch your breath?
264;00:20:02,798;00:20:05,749;I'm fine.
265;00:20:05,884;00:20:08,084;I don't think you
265;00:20:05,884;00:20:08,084;could ride the dragon.
266;00:20:08,170;00:20:10,303;20 years ago, maybe.
267;00:20:10,422;00:20:12,672;What?
267;00:20:10,422;00:20:12,672;Our queen.
268;00:20:12,758;00:20:16,142;She's wild, you know.
268;00:20:12,758;00:20:16,142;Don't let her size fool you.
269;00:20:16,261;00:20:18,979;It's hard enough for me
269;00:20:16,261;00:20:18,979;and I'm a young man.
270;00:20:19,097;00:20:22,849;You, I don't think
270;00:20:19,097;00:20:22,849;your heart could take it.
271;00:20:26,355;00:20:29,022;Must make you angry
271;00:20:26,355;00:20:29,022;that our queen chose me.
272;00:20:29,107;00:20:32,275;Makes me sad.
272;00:20:29,107;00:20:32,275;You'll disappoint her before long.
273;00:20:32,361;00:20:34,778;She'll move on.
273;00:20:32,361;00:20:34,778;We'll all disappoint her before long.
274;00:20:34,913;00:20:37,747;We need each other right now.
274;00:20:34,913;00:20:37,747;After we're done needing each other--
275;00:20:37,833;00:20:41,284;Oh, I don't want to fight you,
275;00:20:37,833;00:20:41,284;Jorah the Andal.
276;00:20:41,370;00:20:43,086;What do I have to gain?
277;00:20:43,171;00:20:45,839;If I win, I'm the shit
277;00:20:43,171;00:20:45,839;who killed an old man.
278;00:20:45,958;00:20:49,092;If I lose, I'm the shit
278;00:20:45,958;00:20:49,092;who was killed by an old man.
279;00:20:50,846;00:20:53,964;You didn't get much
279;00:20:50,846;00:20:53,964;discipline as a child, did you?
280;00:20:54,099;00:20:55,799;None.
281;00:21:02,975;00:21:04,558;The road running
281;00:21:02,975;00:21:04,558;through the Horse Gate,
282;00:21:04,643;00:21:06,476;they call that
282;00:21:04,643;00:21:06,476;the godsway.
283;00:21:06,562;00:21:09,279;Eastern Market,
283;00:21:06,562;00:21:09,279;Western Market.
284;00:21:09,364;00:21:11,054;When Khal Drogo died,
285;00:21:11,078;00:21:13,278;she was supposed to come here
285;00:21:11,078;00:21:13,278;and join the Dosh Khaleen,
286;00:21:13,652;00:21:16,903;the widows
286;00:21:13,652;00:21:16,903;of the dead khals.
287;00:21:16,989;00:21:18,955;That's where they
287;00:21:16,989;00:21:18,955;would have taken her,
288;00:21:19,041;00:21:22,242;the Temple
288;00:21:19,041;00:21:22,242;of the Dosh Khaleen.
289;00:21:30,335;00:21:31,835;What are you doing?
290;00:21:31,970;00:21:34,504;It's forbidden to carry weapons
290;00:21:31,970;00:21:34,504;in the sacred city.
291;00:21:34,590;00:21:38,008;Isn't it forbidden to sneak into
291;00:21:34,590;00:21:38,008;their city and steal their khaleesi?
292;00:21:38,093;00:21:39,976;If they spot us
292;00:21:38,093;00:21:39,976;and we're unarmed,
293;00:21:40,062;00:21:42,512;we'll say we're traders heading
293;00:21:40,062;00:21:42,512;for the Western Market.
294;00:21:42,648;00:21:44,264;But if they see
294;00:21:42,648;00:21:44,264;weapons...
295;00:21:44,349;00:21:46,066;You're asking a dog
295;00:21:44,349;00:21:46,066;to hand over his teeth.
296;00:21:46,184;00:21:48,184;There's 100,000
296;00:21:46,184;00:21:48,184;of them down there.
297;00:21:48,270;00:21:49,769;We can't fight our way out.
298;00:21:49,855;00:21:52,606;We wait till dark,
298;00:21:49,855;00:21:52,606;and then we'll find her.
299;00:21:59,364;00:22:01,281;Uh...
300;00:22:02,618;00:22:05,669;I'm very attached
300;00:22:02,618;00:22:05,669;to this knife.
301;00:22:16,431;00:22:19,049;Don't worry.
301;00:22:16,431;00:22:19,049;It didn't touch you.
302;00:22:20,552;00:22:22,636;You know what happens?
303;00:22:22,721;00:22:24,437;I know what happens.
304;00:22:26,358;00:22:28,191;I'll do it myself.
305;00:23:00,559;00:23:03,426;I should have been
305;00:23:00,559;00:23:03,426;born a Dothraki.
306;00:23:31,173;00:23:34,207;Come on.
307;00:24:51,536;00:24:54,504;Told you, I'm very attached
307;00:24:51,536;00:24:54,504;to this knife.
308;00:24:56,041;00:24:57,540;You all right?
309;00:24:57,676;00:24:59,843;If they find a body
309;00:24:57,676;00:24:59,843;with a stab wound,
310;00:24:59,928;00:25:02,295;the whole city
310;00:24:59,928;00:25:02,295;will be looking for us.
311;00:25:23,735;00:25:24,567;Huh.
312;00:26:55,827;00:26:57,160;Mm-hmm.
313;00:27:12,811;00:27:14,978;No, don't hurt her.
313;00:27:12,811;00:27:14,978;She'll give us away.
314;00:27:15,063;00:27:16,813;We have to go now.
315;00:27:21,603;00:27:24,320;We will never get out
315;00:27:21,603;00:27:24,320;of Vaes Dothrak alive.
316;00:27:24,406;00:27:26,823;All we can do is try.
317;00:27:26,908;00:27:29,108;No.
318;00:27:29,194;00:27:31,411;We can do more than that.
319;00:27:31,529;00:27:33,112;And you're going
319;00:27:31,529;00:27:33,112;to help me.
320;00:28:42,517;00:28:46,269;If I were to let you leave right now,
320;00:28:42,517;00:28:46,269;where would you go?
321;00:28:46,354;00:28:49,022;What would you seek out?
322;00:28:50,942;00:28:53,443;I'd go to my brother,
323;00:28:53,578;00:28:55,028;my husband, my family.
324;00:28:55,113;00:28:59,248;Of course, but for you,
324;00:28:55,113;00:28:59,248;that means seeking out money,
325;00:28:59,334;00:29:02,201;finery, power.
326;00:29:02,287;00:29:06,122;Seeking out your family
326;00:29:02,287;00:29:06,122;means seeking out sin.
327;00:29:06,207;00:29:08,124;I'm not maligning you.
328;00:29:08,209;00:29:11,127;I sought
328;00:29:08,209;00:29:11,127;those things out, too.
329;00:29:11,262;00:29:13,463;To the exclusion
329;00:29:11,262;00:29:13,463;of all else.
330;00:29:15,300;00:29:17,100;My father was a cobbler.
331;00:29:17,185;00:29:21,354;He died when I was young
331;00:29:17,185;00:29:21,354;and I took over his shop.
332;00:29:21,473;00:29:23,973;He was a simple man
332;00:29:21,473;00:29:23,973;and he made simple shoes.
333;00:29:24,059;00:29:27,477;But I found that the more work
333;00:29:24,059;00:29:27,477;I put into my shoes,
334;00:29:27,562;00:29:28,778;the more people
334;00:29:27,562;00:29:28,778;wanted them.
335;00:29:28,863;00:29:31,948;Fine leather,
335;00:29:28,863;00:29:31,948;ornamentation,
336;00:29:32,033;00:29:35,902;detailing,
336;00:29:32,033;00:29:35,902;and time.
337;00:29:35,987;00:29:37,703;Time most of all.
338;00:29:37,822;00:29:40,406;Dozens of hours
338;00:29:37,822;00:29:40,406;spent on a single pair.
339;00:29:40,492;00:29:42,241;Quality takes time.
340;00:29:42,327;00:29:44,293;Yes.
341;00:29:44,379;00:29:46,462;I imagine
341;00:29:44,379;00:29:46,462;you've worn a year
342;00:29:46,548;00:29:49,499;of someone's life
342;00:29:46,548;00:29:49,499;on your back.
343;00:29:49,634;00:29:51,968;The highborn liked to cover
343;00:29:49,634;00:29:51,968;their feet with my time
344;00:29:52,053;00:29:55,054;and they paid well
344;00:29:52,053;00:29:55,054;for the privilege.
345;00:29:55,173;00:29:56,722;I used their money
346;00:29:56,841;00:29:59,559;to buy a taste
346;00:29:56,841;00:29:59,559;of their lives for myself.
347;00:29:59,677;00:30:01,811;Each time I indulged,
348;00:30:01,896;00:30:06,015;I felt myself ascending
348;00:30:01,896;00:30:06,015;to something better.
349;00:30:06,101;00:30:08,101;And one day you walked
349;00:30:06,101;00:30:08,101;through a graveyard
350;00:30:08,186;00:30:09,902;and realized it was
350;00:30:08,186;00:30:09,902;all for nothing
351;00:30:10,021;00:30:12,522;and set out on the path
351;00:30:10,021;00:30:12,522;to righteousness.
352;00:30:12,657;00:30:15,241;Book of the Stranger,

353;00:30:15,360;00:30:17,860;You know
353;00:30:15,360;00:30:17,860;The Seven-Pointed Star.
354;00:30:17,996;00:30:20,663;Septa Unella reads it to me.
354;00:30:17,996;00:30:20,663;At me.
355;00:30:20,748;00:30:24,584;Yes, yes, she does enjoy
355;00:30:20,748;00:30:24,584;reading at people.
356;00:30:26,287;00:30:27,703;You're close.
357;00:30:28,840;00:30:30,873;But it wasn't
357;00:30:28,840;00:30:30,873;a graveyard.
358;00:30:30,959;00:30:32,792;It was a feast.
359;00:30:32,877;00:30:35,178;I bought old fine wine
360;00:30:35,263;00:30:37,296;and young pretty girls
361;00:30:37,382;00:30:41,100;and invited my friends
361;00:30:37,382;00:30:41,100;to come and share it all.
362;00:30:41,219;00:30:44,604;We passed around the wine,
362;00:30:41,219;00:30:44,604;passed around the women,
363;00:30:44,722;00:30:47,440;and soon we fell
363;00:30:44,722;00:30:47,440;into a stupor.
364;00:30:50,728;00:30:53,529;I woke before dawn.
365;00:30:53,615;00:30:56,732;I could barely stand.
366;00:30:56,868;00:31:01,571;Everyone else was asleep on
366;00:30:56,868;00:31:01,571;the couches or on the floor,
367;00:31:01,706;00:31:06,325;lying in heaps next
367;00:31:01,706;00:31:06,325;to their fine clothes.
368;00:31:06,411;00:31:08,878;The truth of their bodies
368;00:31:06,411;00:31:08,878;laid bare.
369;00:31:10,915;00:31:13,749;I could smell them
370;00:31:13,885;00:31:17,220;beneath the incense
370;00:31:13,885;00:31:17,220;and the perfume
371;00:31:17,305;00:31:21,007;and the fine food that had
371;00:31:17,305;00:31:21,007;already started to turn.
372;00:31:23,144;00:31:26,345;And I saw it
372;00:31:23,144;00:31:26,345;with perfect clarity.
373;00:31:27,432;00:31:29,765;I saw what my sins were.
374;00:31:31,269;00:31:34,103;The gold I had, the wine I drank,
374;00:31:31,269;00:31:34,103;the women I used,
375;00:31:34,239;00:31:38,441;my ceaseless struggle
375;00:31:34,239;00:31:38,441;to maintain my position.
376;00:31:43,114;00:31:45,364;It was all part
376;00:31:43,114;00:31:45,364;of a story.
377;00:31:47,785;00:31:50,836;A story I was telling
377;00:31:47,785;00:31:50,836;myself about who I was.
378;00:31:51,839;00:31:53,422;A collection of lies
379;00:31:53,508;00:31:55,458;that would disappear
379;00:31:53,508;00:31:55,458;in the light.
380;00:31:55,593;00:31:59,462;The people I was trying
380;00:31:55,593;00:31:59,462;to climb away from,
381;00:31:59,597;00:32:01,047;the beggars
381;00:31:59,597;00:32:01,047;in the street,
382;00:32:01,132;00:32:02,682;the poor,
383;00:32:02,800;00:32:06,552;they were closer
383;00:32:02,800;00:32:06,552;to the truth than I ever was.
384;00:32:06,638;00:32:09,188;So what did you do?
385;00:32:09,307;00:32:11,140;I left to go
385;00:32:09,307;00:32:11,140;and find them.
386;00:32:11,276;00:32:14,860;I didn't even
386;00:32:11,276;00:32:14,860;put on my shoes.
387;00:32:14,979;00:32:18,864;I walked out the door
387;00:32:14,979;00:32:18,864;and never went back.
388;00:32:24,622;00:32:26,572;Come, let's go
388;00:32:24,622;00:32:26,572;and see him.
389;00:32:27,792;00:32:30,076;Who?
389;00:32:27,792;00:32:30,076;Your brother.
390;00:32:46,177;00:32:47,426;Loras.
391;00:32:53,851;00:32:55,935;Loras.
392;00:33:14,839;00:33:16,706;Listen to me.
393;00:33:16,791;00:33:18,674;You need to stay strong.
394;00:33:22,096;00:33:24,547;I can't stay strong.
395;00:33:24,682;00:33:26,432;I never was strong.
396;00:33:26,551;00:33:28,301;You are strong.
397;00:33:28,386;00:33:30,720;You are the future
397;00:33:28,386;00:33:30,720;of our house,
398;00:33:30,855;00:33:32,221;the future
398;00:33:30,855;00:33:32,221;of our family.
399;00:33:32,357;00:33:34,890;I don't care about that.
399;00:33:32,357;00:33:34,890;Shh!
400;00:33:35,026;00:33:36,776;Shh.
401;00:33:36,894;00:33:39,145;Have you--
401;00:33:36,894;00:33:39,145;have you told them that?
402;00:33:39,230;00:33:40,730;That you don't care?
403;00:33:40,815;00:33:44,817;I just want it to stop.
404;00:33:47,238;00:33:49,071;Help me.
405;00:33:55,630;00:33:58,414;They want me
405;00:33:55,630;00:33:58,414;to help you.
406;00:33:59,751;00:34:01,033;They want me to help
406;00:33:59,751;00:34:01,033;tear you down.
407;00:34:01,034;00:34:02,486;They want me to help
407;00:34:01,034;00:34:02,486;tear you down.
408;00:34:02,587;00:34:05,556;That's why he's letting me see you.
408;00:34:02,587;00:34:05,556;I know it is.
409;00:34:05,657;00:34:09,326;And if either of us give in to
409;00:34:05,657;00:34:09,326;what they want, then they win.
410;00:34:09,427;00:34:11,128;Let them win.
411;00:34:13,064;00:34:14,531;Just make it stop.
412;00:34:14,632;00:34:16,833;Please.
413;00:34:18,102;00:34:20,370;All right.
414;00:34:24,909;00:34:28,745;And now, how to avert disaster
414;00:34:24,909;00:34:28,745;with our current predicament.
415;00:34:28,846;00:34:31,014;This High Sparrow.
416;00:34:31,115;00:34:34,084;I have dealt with fanatics
416;00:34:31,115;00:34:34,084;of every description, Your Grace.
417;00:34:34,185;00:34:37,821;Not setting them off,
417;00:34:34,185;00:34:37,821;that's the most important thing.
418;00:34:37,922;00:34:41,124;You are beset with enemies
418;00:34:37,922;00:34:41,124;both within and without.
419;00:34:41,225;00:34:42,893;What are you doing here?
420;00:34:45,630;00:34:49,032;I am advising the king
420;00:34:45,630;00:34:49,032;on our current predicament.
421;00:34:49,133;00:34:50,076;Leave.
422;00:34:50,100;00:34:52,100;I am a member
422;00:34:50,100;00:34:52,100;of the small council.
423;00:34:52,604;00:34:53,837;The king--
424;00:34:53,938;00:34:56,573;Is this a small
424;00:34:53,938;00:34:56,573;council meeting?
425;00:34:56,674;00:34:57,941;Obviously not.
426;00:34:58,042;00:35:01,144;I'm here to lend my wisdom
426;00:34:58,042;00:35:01,144;and my support.
427;00:35:01,245;00:35:04,481;Thank you for your counsel,
427;00:35:01,245;00:35:04,481;Grand Maester.
428;00:35:04,582;00:35:06,483;That will be all
428;00:35:04,582;00:35:06,483;for now.
429;00:35:06,584;00:35:08,352;Your Grace.
430;00:35:32,143;00:35:35,679;Since I've missed
430;00:35:32,143;00:35:35,679;the past several small council meetings,
431;00:35:35,780;00:35:38,548;I wanted to speak to you
431;00:35:35,780;00:35:38,548;about a few things.
432;00:35:40,251;00:35:42,552;I've been thinking
432;00:35:40,251;00:35:42,552;about the High Sparrow.
433;00:35:42,654;00:35:45,322;As have we all,
433;00:35:42,654;00:35:45,322;unfortunately.
434;00:35:45,423;00:35:48,325;We need to be careful
434;00:35:45,423;00:35:48,325;in dealing with such a man.
435;00:35:49,794;00:35:52,229;To prevent things from
435;00:35:49,794;00:35:52,229;escalating any further.
436;00:35:54,365;00:35:56,600;We have to be careful
436;00:35:54,365;00:35:56,600;not to antagonize him.
437;00:35:56,701;00:35:59,102;He has Margaery.
437;00:35:56,701;00:35:59,102;We can't put her at risk.
438;00:35:59,203;00:36:01,938;He's dangerous.
438;00:35:59,203;00:36:01,938;Look at me.
439;00:36:02,040;00:36:03,874;What did they do to me?
440;00:36:03,975;00:36:05,909;To the king's own mother?
441;00:36:10,481;00:36:13,116;It's all right.
442;00:36:13,217;00:36:15,652;It's done.
442;00:36:13,217;00:36:15,652;It's in the past.
443;00:36:15,753;00:36:17,988;And of course
444;00:36:18,089;00:36:20,791;Margaery's safety
444;00:36:18,089;00:36:20,791;is paramount.
445;00:36:22,160;00:36:26,029;You don't like Margaery,
445;00:36:22,160;00:36:26,029;do you?
446;00:36:27,765;00:36:30,867;Whether I like her or not
446;00:36:27,765;00:36:30,867;is completely unimportant.
447;00:36:33,337;00:36:34,938;Margaery is the queen.
448;00:36:36,541;00:36:39,643;Queens must command respect.
448;00:36:36,541;00:36:39,643;Kings even more so.
449;00:36:39,744;00:36:42,546;Not just for their own sake,
449;00:36:39,744;00:36:42,546;but for everyone's.
450;00:36:44,515;00:36:47,951;The High Sparrow has no respect for
450;00:36:44,515;00:36:47,951;kings or queens.
451;00:36:48,052;00:36:49,886;No respect for anything
451;00:36:48,052;00:36:49,886;in this world.
452;00:36:49,987;00:36:52,889;He has no use
452;00:36:49,987;00:36:52,889;for the things of this world.
453;00:36:52,990;00:36:56,626;He wants to knock them down
453;00:36:52,990;00:36:56,626;and replace them with what?
454;00:36:56,728;00:36:58,829;With fantasies.
455;00:36:58,930;00:37:00,931;With beggars
455;00:36:58,930;00:37:00,931;in the street.
456;00:37:01,032;00:37:02,232;With nothing.
457;00:37:04,235;00:37:05,802;Mother...
458;00:37:07,438;00:37:09,072;there's something
458;00:37:07,438;00:37:09,072;I want to tell you.
459;00:37:10,541;00:37:12,843;Something the High
459;00:37:10,541;00:37:12,843;Sparrow told me.
460;00:37:15,646;00:37:17,347;You've spoken with him?
461;00:37:19,317;00:37:22,753;I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone.
461;00:37:19,317;00:37:22,753;If he found out I told--
462;00:37:22,854;00:37:25,655;It would be a breach of confidence which
462;00:37:22,854;00:37:25,655;he would not take lightly
463;00:37:25,757;00:37:28,525;given his constant
463;00:37:25,757;00:37:28,525;prattling about the truth.
464;00:37:31,729;00:37:34,164;I am your mother.
465;00:37:35,199;00:37:37,234;You can always trust me.
466;00:37:45,209;00:37:48,612;The small council meeting has been
466;00:37:45,209;00:37:48,612;postponed on the king's orders.
467;00:37:48,713;00:37:51,073;I would have thought we were
467;00:37:48,713;00:37:51,073;perfectly clear the first time.
468;00:37:51,149;00:37:52,345;You're not welcome.
469;00:37:52,369;00:37:54,317;You once spoke of your
469;00:37:52,369;00:37:54,317;respect for our father
470;00:37:54,318;00:37:57,053;because he understood the necessity
470;00:37:54,318;00:37:57,053;of working with one's rivals.
471;00:37:57,155;00:38:01,958;My dear, you have been stripped of your
471;00:37:57,155;00:38:01,958;dignity and authority,
472;00:38:02,059;00:38:05,061;publically shamed,
472;00:38:02,059;00:38:05,061;and confined to the Red Keep.
473;00:38:05,163;00:38:07,397;What's left to work with?
474;00:38:07,498;00:38:09,900;Cersei is the mother
474;00:38:07,498;00:38:09,900;of the king.
475;00:38:10,001;00:38:12,702;She has the king's ear
475;00:38:10,001;00:38:12,702;and his trust.
476;00:38:12,804;00:38:14,738;And the king has been
476;00:38:12,804;00:38:14,738;speaking regularly
477;00:38:14,839;00:38:18,241;with the High Sparrow
477;00:38:14,839;00:38:18,241;about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.
478;00:38:18,342;00:38:19,976;The High Sparrow
478;00:38:18,342;00:38:19,976;seized power
479;00:38:20,077;00:38:22,045;knowing full well
479;00:38:20,077;00:38:22,045;we'd bicker amongst ourselves
480;00:38:22,146;00:38:23,847;instead of
480;00:38:22,146;00:38:23,847;seizing it back.
481;00:38:23,948;00:38:25,749;Here we are.
481;00:38:23,948;00:38:25,749;Well done to us.
482;00:38:25,850;00:38:27,951;Now the future
482;00:38:25,850;00:38:27,951;of the Seven Kingdoms
483;00:38:28,052;00:38:29,886;rests in his dirty
483;00:38:28,052;00:38:29,886;peasant hands.
484;00:38:29,987;00:38:32,756;In a few days, he'll have
484;00:38:29,987;00:38:32,756;a trial for me.
485;00:38:32,857;00:38:36,426;But before that, Queen Margaery
485;00:38:32,857;00:38:36,426;will make her walk of atonement.
486;00:38:36,527;00:38:40,130;Yes, Margaery
486;00:38:36,527;00:38:40,130;will repent her sins
487;00:38:40,231;00:38:42,199;before the good people
487;00:38:40,231;00:38:42,199;of the city.
488;00:38:42,300;00:38:44,768;Oh, no.
489;00:38:44,869;00:38:47,671;That cannot happen.
490;00:38:47,772;00:38:49,573;That will not happen.
491;00:38:49,674;00:38:51,341;I agree.
492;00:38:53,978;00:38:56,880;You've got the second largest
492;00:38:53,978;00:38:56,880;army in Westeros.
493;00:38:56,981;00:38:58,415;You'll bring them
493;00:38:56,981;00:38:58,415;into the city,
494;00:38:58,516;00:39:01,184;stop Queen Margaery's
494;00:38:58,516;00:39:01,184;humiliation before it starts,
495;00:39:01,285;00:39:03,687;and take her back
495;00:39:01,285;00:39:03,687;into Crown custody.
496;00:39:03,788;00:39:07,524;The king has ordered me to take
496;00:39:03,788;00:39:07,524;no action against the High Sparrow
497;00:39:07,625;00:39:10,727;or the Faith Militant out of fear
497;00:39:07,625;00:39:10,727;for the queen's safety.
498;00:39:10,828;00:39:12,662;You will take
498;00:39:10,828;00:39:12,662;no action at all.
499;00:39:12,763;00:39:15,298;When the Tyrell armies come,
499;00:39:12,763;00:39:15,298;you will stand down.
500;00:39:15,399;00:39:19,069;Are you expressly
500;00:39:15,399;00:39:19,069;forbidden from standing down?
501;00:39:19,170;00:39:22,038;No, but if the king
501;00:39:19,170;00:39:22,038;should call--
502;00:39:22,139;00:39:24,908;The whole thing will be over before
502;00:39:22,139;00:39:24,908;anyone can call on you to do anything.
503;00:39:25,009;00:39:29,145;When the High Sparrow is in custody
503;00:39:25,009;00:39:29,145;or dead, preferably,
504;00:39:29,247;00:39:31,781;and Margaery's back
504;00:39:29,247;00:39:31,781;at Tommen's side,
505;00:39:31,883;00:39:33,984;do you think the king
505;00:39:31,883;00:39:33,984;will be angry at the outcome?
506;00:39:34,085;00:39:36,820;You hate these fanatics
506;00:39:34,085;00:39:36,820;as much as we do.
507;00:39:36,921;00:39:40,190;You hate what
507;00:39:36,921;00:39:40,190;they've done to your son.
508;00:39:40,291;00:39:42,158;Do you want Lancel back?
509;00:39:42,260;00:39:44,127;Or have you
509;00:39:42,260;00:39:44,127;given him up for good?
510;00:39:45,930;00:39:48,164;Of course
510;00:39:45,930;00:39:48,164;I want him back.
511;00:39:51,569;00:39:53,169;Then stand aside
512;00:39:53,271;00:39:56,473;and let the people
512;00:39:53,271;00:39:56,473;that took him from you be destroyed.
513;00:40:00,044;00:40:01,845;If it doesn't
513;00:40:00,044;00:40:01,845;go as planned,
514;00:40:01,946;00:40:04,314;the sparrows have
514;00:40:01,946;00:40:04,314;many friends in this city.
515;00:40:04,415;00:40:07,150;We'll have civil war.
515;00:40:04,415;00:40:07,150;Many will die.
516;00:40:07,251;00:40:09,653;Many will die
516;00:40:07,251;00:40:09,653;no matter what we do.
517;00:40:11,422;00:40:13,156;Better them than us.
518;00:41:09,580;00:41:11,948;They told me you were home
518;00:41:09,580;00:41:11,948;and I didn't believe it.
519;00:41:14,018;00:41:16,753;Theon Greyjoy?
519;00:41:14,018;00:41:16,753;I said.
520;00:41:16,854;00:41:19,189;He's dead.
521;00:41:19,290;00:41:21,658;He's been dead
521;00:41:19,290;00:41:21,658;a long time.
522;00:41:24,795;00:41:26,763;He let you go?
523;00:41:26,864;00:41:28,331;I escaped.
524;00:41:30,868;00:41:32,702;I can't hear you.
525;00:41:32,803;00:41:34,471;I escaped.
526;00:41:36,807;00:41:38,575;Look at me.
527;00:41:47,251;00:41:48,651;Look at me.
528;00:41:50,121;00:41:52,756;Men died trying
528;00:41:50,121;00:41:52,756;to rescue you.
529;00:41:52,857;00:41:54,457;Good men.
530;00:41:54,558;00:41:56,026;My men.
531;00:41:57,495;00:41:59,129;I'm sorry.
532;00:41:59,230;00:42:01,264;You were my brother.
533;00:42:01,365;00:42:04,401;You were a spoiled little cunt,
533;00:42:01,365;00:42:04,401;but you were my brother
534;00:42:04,502;00:42:06,469;and I risked
534;00:42:04,502;00:42:06,469;everything for you
535;00:42:06,570;00:42:07,937;and you betrayed me.
536;00:42:08,039;00:42:10,206;I know.
536;00:42:08,039;00:42:10,206;I know and I'm sorry.
537;00:42:10,307;00:42:11,608;Stop saying that.
538;00:42:12,676;00:42:13,910;He broke me.
539;00:42:14,011;00:42:16,713;He broke me
539;00:42:14,011;00:42:16,713;into 1,000 pieces.
540;00:42:16,814;00:42:18,181;I know.
540;00:42:16,814;00:42:18,181;You don't know.
541;00:42:18,282;00:42:20,784;He sent us
541;00:42:18,282;00:42:20,784;one of those pieces.
542;00:42:20,885;00:42:22,852;That's why
542;00:42:20,885;00:42:22,852;I came for you.
543;00:42:28,893;00:42:30,794;Why did you come here?
544;00:42:30,895;00:42:32,495;Where else could I go?
545;00:42:32,596;00:42:36,299;You heard Father was dead and you thought
545;00:42:32,596;00:42:36,299;you'd claim the crown?
546;00:42:36,400;00:42:38,368;No, no. I only heard he died
546;00:42:36,400;00:42:38,368;after we docked.
547;00:42:38,469;00:42:41,371;You happen to show up
547;00:42:38,469;00:42:41,371;on Pyke right before the kingsmoot?
548;00:42:41,472;00:42:42,939;I didn't know.
549;00:42:45,943;00:42:49,145;You think any ironborn
549;00:42:45,943;00:42:49,145;wants you to be king
550;00:42:49,246;00:42:51,047;after what you've done?
551;00:42:51,148;00:42:53,116;I don't want
551;00:42:51,148;00:42:53,116;to be king.
552;00:42:53,217;00:42:56,453;What do you want?
553;00:42:56,554;00:42:58,594;I should have listened to you.
553;00:42:56,554;00:42:58,594;You're the only one--
554;00:42:58,689;00:43:01,024;That doesn't matter anymore.
554;00:42:58,689;00:43:01,024;Stop crying.
555;00:43:01,125;00:43:03,126;Look at me.
556;00:43:03,227;00:43:06,396;Tell me what you want.
557;00:43:10,768;00:43:13,436;You should rule
557;00:43:10,768;00:43:13,436;the Iron Islands.
558;00:43:14,705;00:43:16,673;Let me help you.
559;00:43:43,400;00:43:45,502;They've cleaned
559;00:43:43,400;00:43:45,502;you up nicely.
560;00:43:47,738;00:43:49,506;You know who I am?
561;00:43:51,108;00:43:52,308;A lord.
562;00:43:52,409;00:43:54,344;Yes.
563;00:43:54,445;00:43:57,013;A lord.
564;00:43:57,114;00:43:59,048;You've seen my banners?
565;00:44:00,384;00:44:02,519;The flayed man.
566;00:44:02,620;00:44:05,455;Does that worry
566;00:44:02,620;00:44:05,455;you at all?
567;00:44:05,556;00:44:07,056;You eat them after?
568;00:44:10,728;00:44:11,961;No.
569;00:44:12,062;00:44:15,064;Then I've seen worse.
570;00:44:39,223;00:44:41,257;You served the Starks?
571;00:44:41,358;00:44:43,893;Aye.
571;00:44:41,358;00:44:43,893;They put me in chains
572;00:44:43,994;00:44:45,862;and put a sword
572;00:44:43,994;00:44:45,862;at my throat,
573;00:44:45,963;00:44:47,230;so I served them.
574;00:44:47,331;00:44:50,700;The Starks have been
574;00:44:47,331;00:44:50,700;gone for a long time,
575;00:44:50,801;00:44:53,570;but you kept
575;00:44:50,801;00:44:53,570;protecting Rickon.
576;00:44:53,671;00:44:57,173;He'd fetch a good price
576;00:44:53,671;00:44:57,173;to the right buyer.
577;00:44:57,274;00:44:59,042;I served his family
577;00:44:57,274;00:44:59,042;a long time.
578;00:44:59,143;00:45:01,277;Didn't get no wages.
579;00:45:01,378;00:45:04,514;Way I see it,
579;00:45:01,378;00:45:04,514;I'm owed.
580;00:45:06,650;00:45:09,252;Be that as it may,
581;00:45:09,353;00:45:11,821;Rickon's not yours
581;00:45:09,353;00:45:11,821;to sell anymore.
582;00:45:11,922;00:45:13,590;He's mine.
583;00:45:13,691;00:45:16,726;So what use could I possibly
583;00:45:13,691;00:45:16,726;have for you?
584;00:45:19,129;00:45:21,464;I can give you
584;00:45:19,129;00:45:21,464;what you want.
585;00:45:21,565;00:45:23,800;And you're sure
585;00:45:21,565;00:45:23,800;you know what that is?
586;00:45:25,402;00:45:28,905;Same thing
586;00:45:25,402;00:45:28,905;men always want.
587;00:45:29,006;00:45:33,209;And when they really want it,
587;00:45:29,006;00:45:33,209;they give it a bath first.
588;00:45:41,518;00:45:43,786;You're a good talker.
589;00:45:46,056;00:45:47,924;I like that.
590;00:45:55,499;00:45:59,235;You're a much better talker
590;00:45:55,499;00:45:59,235;than Theon Greyjoy.
591;00:46:00,638;00:46:02,438;That so?
592;00:46:02,539;00:46:04,841;I had to work hard
592;00:46:02,539;00:46:04,841;to get him talking.
593;00:46:04,942;00:46:07,443;But he talked.
594;00:46:07,544;00:46:09,212;They all do.
595;00:46:09,313;00:46:12,081;He told me everything.
596;00:46:12,182;00:46:15,018;All about the Stark boys,
597;00:46:15,119;00:46:17,353;who helped them escape,
598;00:46:17,454;00:46:18,788;and how she did it.
599;00:46:47,251;00:46:49,152;Open the gate!
600;00:47:36,133;00:47:38,234;Sorry about the food.
601;00:47:38,335;00:47:40,370;It's not what
601;00:47:38,335;00:47:40,370;we're known for.
602;00:47:40,471;00:47:42,939;That's all right.
602;00:47:40,471;00:47:42,939;There are more important things.
603;00:47:47,945;00:47:49,779;A letter for you,
603;00:47:47,945;00:47:49,779;Lord Commander.
604;00:47:51,582;00:47:53,483;I'm not Lord
604;00:47:51,582;00:47:53,483;Commander anymore.
605;00:48:13,437;00:48:15,972;To the traitor
605;00:48:13,437;00:48:15,972;and bastard Jon Snow.
606;00:48:16,073;00:48:19,308;You allowed thousands
606;00:48:16,073;00:48:19,308;of wildlings past the Wall.
607;00:48:19,410;00:48:20,877;You have betrayed
607;00:48:19,410;00:48:20,877;your own kind.
608;00:48:20,978;00:48:22,845;You have betrayed
608;00:48:20,978;00:48:22,845;the North.
609;00:48:22,946;00:48:26,082;Winterfell is mine, bastard.
609;00:48:22,946;00:48:26,082;Come and see.
610;00:48:27,684;00:48:29,752;Your brother Rickon
610;00:48:27,684;00:48:29,752;is in my dungeon.
611;00:48:38,429;00:48:40,430;His direwolf's skin
611;00:48:38,429;00:48:40,430;is on my floor.
612;00:48:40,531;00:48:43,223;Come and see.
612;00:48:40,531;00:48:43,223;I want my bride back.
613;00:48:43,224;00:48:44,507;Send her to me, bastard,
614;00:48:44,531;00:48:46,803;and I will not trouble you
614;00:48:44,531;00:48:46,803;or your wildling lovers.
615;00:48:46,804;00:48:49,906;Keep her from me
615;00:48:46,804;00:48:49,906;and I will ride north and slaughter
616;00:48:50,007;00:48:53,509;every wildling man, woman,
616;00:48:50,007;00:48:53,509;and babe living under your protection.
617;00:48:53,610;00:48:56,257;You will watch
617;00:48:53,610;00:48:56,257;as I skin them living.
618;00:48:56,281;00:48:58,281;You--
619;00:48:59,383;00:49:01,017;Go on.
620;00:49:01,118;00:49:02,919;It's just more
620;00:49:01,118;00:49:02,919;of the same.
621;00:49:07,791;00:49:11,394;You will watch as my soldiers
621;00:49:07,791;00:49:11,394;take turns raping your sister.
622;00:49:12,896;00:49:14,197;You will watch
622;00:49:12,896;00:49:14,197;as my dogs
623;00:49:14,298;00:49:16,899;devour your wild
623;00:49:14,298;00:49:16,899;little brother.
624;00:49:18,936;00:49:22,538;Then I will spoon your eyes from their
624;00:49:18,936;00:49:22,538;sockets and let my dogs do the rest.
625;00:49:22,639;00:49:26,576;Come and see.
625;00:49:22,639;00:49:26,576;Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell
626;00:49:26,677;00:49:28,411;and Warden of the North.
627;00:49:31,949;00:49:35,852;Lord of Winterfell
627;00:49:31,949;00:49:35,852;and Warden of the North.
628;00:49:35,953;00:49:38,855;His father's dead.
629;00:49:38,956;00:49:40,490;Ramsay killed him.
630;00:49:40,591;00:49:42,959;And now he has Rickon.
630;00:49:40,591;00:49:42,959;- We don't know that.
631;00:49:43,060;00:49:45,461;Yes, we do.
632;00:49:45,562;00:49:48,064;How many men does
632;00:49:45,562;00:49:48,064;he have in his army?
633;00:49:50,133;00:49:51,576;I heard him say 5,000
634;00:49:51,600;00:49:53,612;once when he was talking
634;00:49:51,600;00:49:53,612;about Stannis's attack.
635;00:49:53,971;00:49:56,339;How many do you have?
636;00:49:56,440;00:49:59,375;That can march and fight?
637;00:49:59,476;00:50:01,210;2,000.
638;00:50:02,513;00:50:05,214;The rest are children
638;00:50:02,513;00:50:05,214;and old people.
639;00:50:09,920;00:50:12,855;You're the son of the last
639;00:50:09,920;00:50:12,855;true Warden of the North.
640;00:50:12,956;00:50:16,592;Northern families are loyal.
640;00:50:12,956;00:50:16,592;They'll fight for you if you ask.
641;00:50:18,729;00:50:22,932;A monster has taken
641;00:50:18,729;00:50:22,932;our home and our brother.
