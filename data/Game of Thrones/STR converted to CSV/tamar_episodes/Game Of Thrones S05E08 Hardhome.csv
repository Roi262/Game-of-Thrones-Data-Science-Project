6;00:02:04,136;00:02:06,805;Your Grace,
6;00:02:04,136;00:02:06,805;I want to say--
7;00:02:06,839;00:02:08,773;You will not speak.
8;00:02:10,709;00:02:12,710;How do I know you are
8;00:02:10,709;00:02:12,710;who you say you are?
9;00:02:12,745;00:02:15,547;If only I were otherwise.
10;00:02:15,581;00:02:18,349;If you are Tyrion Lannister,
10;00:02:15,581;00:02:18,349;why shouldn't I kill you
11;00:02:18,384;00:02:20,685;to pay your family back
11;00:02:18,384;00:02:20,685;for what it did to mine?
12;00:02:20,719;00:02:23,388;You want revenge
12;00:02:20,719;00:02:23,388;against the Lannisters?
13;00:02:23,456;00:02:25,790;I killed my mother
13;00:02:23,456;00:02:25,790;Joanna Lannister
14;00:02:25,825;00:02:27,659;on the day I was born.
15;00:02:27,693;00:02:31,229;I killed my father Tywin Lannister with
15;00:02:27,693;00:02:31,229;a bolt to the heart.
16;00:02:31,263;00:02:33,898;I am the greatest
16;00:02:31,263;00:02:33,898;Lannister killer of our time.
17;00:02:33,933;00:02:36,067;So I should welcome you
17;00:02:33,933;00:02:36,067;into my service
18;00:02:36,101;00:02:38,336;because you murdered members
18;00:02:36,101;00:02:38,336;of your own family?
19;00:02:39,572;00:02:42,106;Into your service?
20;00:02:42,141;00:02:45,076;Your Grace, we have
20;00:02:42,141;00:02:45,076;only just met.
21;00:02:45,110;00:02:47,445;It's too soon to know
21;00:02:45,110;00:02:47,445;if you deserve my service.
22;00:02:47,513;00:02:50,315;If you'd rather return
22;00:02:47,513;00:02:50,315;to the fighting pits,
23;00:02:50,349;00:02:52,584;just say the word.
24;00:02:54,720;00:02:57,255;When I was a young man,
24;00:02:54,720;00:02:57,255;I heard a story
25;00:02:57,289;00:03:00,758;about a baby born
25;00:02:57,289;00:03:00,758;during the worst storm in living memory.
26;00:03:00,793;00:03:02,794;She had no wealth,
26;00:03:00,793;00:03:02,794;no lands, no army,
27;00:03:02,828;00:03:06,231;only a name
27;00:03:02,828;00:03:06,231;and a handful of supporters,
28;00:03:06,265;00:03:09,767;most of whom probably thought they
28;00:03:06,265;00:03:09,767;could use that name to benefit themselves.
29;00:03:09,802;00:03:12,370;They kept her alive,
29;00:03:09,802;00:03:12,370;moving her from place to place,
30;00:03:12,404;00:03:15,573;often hours ahead of the men
30;00:03:12,404;00:03:15,573;who'd been sent to kill her.
31;00:03:15,608;00:03:18,910;She was eventually sold off to
31;00:03:15,608;00:03:18,910;some warlord on the edge of the world
32;00:03:18,978;00:03:21,179;and that appeared
32;00:03:18,978;00:03:21,179;to be that.
33;00:03:21,213;00:03:23,214;And then
33;00:03:21,213;00:03:23,214;a few years later,
34;00:03:23,249;00:03:25,550;the most well-informed
34;00:03:23,249;00:03:25,550;person I knew
35;00:03:25,618;00:03:28,453;told me that this girl
35;00:03:25,618;00:03:28,453;without wealth, lands, or armies
36;00:03:28,487;00:03:31,689;had somehow acquired all three
36;00:03:28,487;00:03:31,689;in a very short span of time,
37;00:03:31,724;00:03:33,725;along with three dragons.
38;00:03:33,759;00:03:35,793;He thought
38;00:03:33,759;00:03:35,793;she was our best,
39;00:03:35,828;00:03:38,730;last chance to build
39;00:03:35,828;00:03:38,730;a better world.
40;00:03:40,165;00:03:42,867;I thought you were worth
40;00:03:40,165;00:03:42,867;meeting at the very least.
41;00:03:42,902;00:03:44,369;And why are you
41;00:03:42,902;00:03:44,369;worth meeting?
42;00:03:44,403;00:03:46,204;Why should I spend
42;00:03:44,403;00:03:46,204;my time listening to you?
43;00:03:46,238;00:03:49,340;Because you cannot build
43;00:03:46,238;00:03:49,340;a better world on your own.
44;00:03:49,375;00:03:52,777;You have no one at your side who
44;00:03:49,375;00:03:52,777;understands the land you want to rule.
45;00:03:52,811;00:03:54,812;The strengths
45;00:03:52,811;00:03:54,812;and weaknesses of the houses
46;00:03:54,847;00:03:56,147;that will either
46;00:03:54,847;00:03:56,147;join or oppose you.
47;00:03:56,181;00:03:59,183;I will have
47;00:03:56,181;00:03:59,183;a very large army
48;00:03:59,218;00:04:00,785;and very large dragons.
49;00:04:00,819;00:04:04,389;Killing and politics
49;00:04:00,819;00:04:04,389;aren't always the same thing.
50;00:04:04,423;00:04:06,357;When I served
50;00:04:04,423;00:04:06,357;as Hand of the King,
51;00:04:06,392;00:04:09,027;I did quite well with the latter
51;00:04:06,392;00:04:09,027;considering the king in question
52;00:04:09,061;00:04:11,362;preferred torturing animals
52;00:04:09,061;00:04:11,362;to leading his people.
53;00:04:12,598;00:04:14,465;I could do
53;00:04:12,598;00:04:14,465;an even better job
54;00:04:14,500;00:04:16,768;advising a ruler
54;00:04:14,500;00:04:16,768;worth the name.
55;00:04:16,802;00:04:19,170;If that is indeed
55;00:04:16,802;00:04:19,170;what you are.
56;00:04:19,204;00:04:21,472;So you want
56;00:04:19,204;00:04:21,472;to advise me?
57;00:04:23,609;00:04:25,710;Very well.
58;00:04:27,112;00:04:28,646;What would you
58;00:04:27,112;00:04:28,646;have me do with him?
59;00:04:30,382;00:04:34,085;I swore I would kill him
59;00:04:30,382;00:04:34,085;if he ever returned.
60;00:04:34,119;00:04:36,020;I know.
61;00:04:39,458;00:04:43,394;Why should the people
61;00:04:39,458;00:04:43,394;trust a queen who can't keep her promises?
62;00:04:46,465;00:04:49,200;Whomever Ser Jorah
62;00:04:46,465;00:04:49,200;was when he started informing on you,
63;00:04:49,234;00:04:52,303;he is no longer that man.
64;00:04:52,338;00:04:54,372;I can't remember
64;00:04:52,338;00:04:54,372;ever seeing a sane man
65;00:04:54,473;00:04:56,774;as devoted to anything
65;00:04:54,473;00:04:56,774;as he is to serving you.
66;00:04:56,809;00:04:59,877;He claims he would kill
66;00:04:56,809;00:04:59,877;for you and die for you
67;00:04:59,912;00:05:02,614;and nothing I ever witnessed
67;00:04:59,912;00:05:02,614;gives me reason to doubt him.
68;00:05:06,552;00:05:08,686;And yet he did
68;00:05:06,552;00:05:08,686;betray you.
69;00:05:21,166;00:05:23,801;Did he have an opportunity
69;00:05:21,166;00:05:23,801;to confess his betrayal?
70;00:05:23,836;00:05:26,070;Yes.
71;00:05:26,105;00:05:28,139;Many opportunities.
72;00:05:28,207;00:05:30,808;And did he?
73;00:05:30,843;00:05:35,213;No, not until
73;00:05:30,843;00:05:35,213;forced to do so.
74;00:05:39,918;00:05:41,853;He worships you.
75;00:05:41,887;00:05:44,689;He is in love
75;00:05:41,887;00:05:44,689;with you, I think.
76;00:05:44,723;00:05:47,025;But he did not trust you
76;00:05:44,723;00:05:47,025;with the truth.
77;00:05:47,059;00:05:48,559;An unpleasant truth
77;00:05:47,059;00:05:48,559;to be sure,
78;00:05:48,627;00:05:51,062;but one of great
78;00:05:48,627;00:05:51,062;significance to you.
79;00:05:51,096;00:05:54,232;He did not trust that you would
79;00:05:51,096;00:05:54,232;be wise >enough to forgive him.
80;00:05:55,367;00:05:57,268;So I should kill him?
81;00:05:58,570;00:06:00,638;A ruler who kills
81;00:05:58,570;00:06:00,638;those devoted to her
82;00:06:00,673;00:06:03,374;is not a ruler
82;00:06:00,673;00:06:03,374;who inspires devotion.
83;00:06:03,409;00:06:05,576;And you're going to need
83;00:06:03,409;00:06:05,576;to inspire devotion,
84;00:06:05,611;00:06:09,447;a lot of it, if you're ever going to rule
84;00:06:05,611;00:06:09,447;across the Narrow Sea.
85;00:06:11,083;00:06:14,352;But you cannot have him
85;00:06:11,083;00:06:14,352;by your side when you do.
86;00:06:19,725;00:06:22,060;Remove Ser Jorah
86;00:06:19,725;00:06:22,060;from the city.
87;00:07:33,098;00:07:34,799;Confess.
88;00:07:34,833;00:07:37,068;My son.
89;00:07:38,704;00:07:41,139;Let me speak to--
90;00:07:41,173;00:07:42,440;Confess.
91;00:07:42,474;00:07:44,375;I meant it.
92;00:07:44,409;00:07:48,179;My face will be
92;00:07:44,409;00:07:48,179;the last thing you see--
93;00:08:04,496;00:08:08,199;My name is Lanna.
93;00:08:04,496;00:08:08,199;I'm an orphan.
94;00:08:09,802;00:08:11,736;When I was eight,
94;00:08:09,802;00:08:11,736;I begged enough money
95;00:08:11,770;00:08:13,771;to buy my first
95;00:08:11,770;00:08:13,771;bucket of oysters.
96;00:08:13,806;00:08:18,109;I sold that bucket and made
96;00:08:13,806;00:08:18,109;enough money to buy two more.
97;00:08:20,078;00:08:23,581;It took a while,
97;00:08:20,078;00:08:23,581;but I finally saved enough
98;00:08:23,615;00:08:25,716;to buy myself
98;00:08:23,615;00:08:25,716;an oyster cart.
99;00:08:25,751;00:08:27,552;Now every morning,
100;00:08:27,586;00:08:29,687;I make my way
100;00:08:27,586;00:08:29,687;down to the canals.
101;00:08:31,723;00:08:34,959;I pass the fish mongers
101;00:08:31,723;00:08:34,959;and the bakers.
102;00:08:40,032;00:08:41,699;I usually see Lhara,
103;00:08:41,733;00:08:44,769;my first customer of the day
103;00:08:41,733;00:08:44,769;on her way home.
104;00:08:46,205;00:08:49,574;Then I turn left
104;00:08:46,205;00:08:49,574;onto Moonsinger Lane--
105;00:08:52,044;00:08:55,179;Turn left
105;00:08:52,044;00:08:55,179;onto Ragman Lane
106;00:08:55,214;00:08:56,714;where I do
106;00:08:55,214;00:08:56,714;most of my trade.
107;00:08:56,748;00:08:58,983;Lanna is very impressive.
108;00:08:59,017;00:09:01,686;Very industrious.
109;00:09:01,720;00:09:04,422;She will make a fine servant
109;00:09:01,720;00:09:04,422;for the Many-Faced God.
110;00:09:04,456;00:09:06,457;How will she serve him?
111;00:09:06,491;00:09:09,927;She will no longer
111;00:09:06,491;00:09:09,927;turn left onto Ragman Lane.
112;00:09:09,962;00:09:12,363;She will turn right
112;00:09:09,962;00:09:12,363;and go to Ragman Harbor.
113;00:09:12,397;00:09:13,965;What will she do there?
114;00:09:14,032;00:09:16,033;She will see.
115;00:09:16,068;00:09:18,970;See what?
116;00:09:19,004;00:09:21,539;How can a man
116;00:09:19,004;00:09:21,539;tell a girl this?
117;00:09:21,607;00:09:22,840;If he knew
117;00:09:21,607;00:09:22,840;what she would see,
118;00:09:22,875;00:09:25,343;there would be
118;00:09:22,875;00:09:25,343;no reason to send her.
119;00:09:25,377;00:09:28,012;Oysters, clams,
119;00:09:25,377;00:09:28,012;and cockles!
120;00:09:45,197;00:09:48,266;Oysters, clams,
120;00:09:45,197;00:09:48,266;and cockles!
121;00:09:56,308;00:09:59,677;Oysters, clams,
121;00:09:56,308;00:09:59,677;and cockles!
122;00:09:59,711;00:10:02,780;Your oysters fresh?
123;00:10:02,814;00:10:04,448;Best in the city.
124;00:10:04,483;00:10:06,584;You wouldn't lie
124;00:10:04,483;00:10:06,584;to an old man, would you?
125;00:10:19,498;00:10:21,532;Mm.
126;00:10:21,566;00:10:25,403;Very nice.
126;00:10:21,566;00:10:25,403;Give me four with vinegar.
127;00:10:28,974;00:10:30,675;It's my 18th voyage.
128;00:10:30,709;00:10:33,277;Returned from all of them
128;00:10:30,709;00:10:33,277;without a scratch on me.
129;00:10:39,952;00:10:41,385;Can't do it.
130;00:10:41,420;00:10:44,422;Please,
130;00:10:41,420;00:10:44,422;I've three children.
131;00:10:44,456;00:10:46,157;Without me...
132;00:10:46,191;00:10:47,692;Here, take it.
132;00:10:46,191;00:10:47,692;You have to.
133;00:10:47,726;00:10:49,493;I've three children.
134;00:10:49,528;00:10:50,761;What will they do?
134;00:10:49,528;00:10:50,761;Come on.
135;00:10:50,796;00:10:52,530;They've nothing
135;00:10:50,796;00:10:52,530;without me.
136;00:10:52,564;00:10:54,098;Please, you have to!
137;00:10:54,132;00:10:56,567;Please, you don't
137;00:10:54,132;00:10:56,567;understand!
138;00:10:56,601;00:10:58,235;Please!
139;00:11:04,309;00:11:06,243;The man is a gambler.
140;00:11:07,746;00:11:09,413;He wages that
140;00:11:07,746;00:11:09,413;a sailor's ship
141;00:11:09,448;00:11:12,683;will make it
141;00:11:09,448;00:11:12,683;to its destination.
142;00:11:12,718;00:11:15,119;It is a strange wager
142;00:11:12,718;00:11:15,119;for the captain.
143;00:11:15,153;00:11:17,788;He only wins
143;00:11:15,153;00:11:17,788;if he loses his life.
144;00:11:19,891;00:11:22,927;So why would a captain make the wager
144;00:11:19,891;00:11:22,927;in the first place?
145;00:11:24,696;00:11:27,431;A girl tells a man
145;00:11:24,696;00:11:27,431;that she has seen.

147;00:11:32,204;00:11:34,472;the thin man pays
147;00:11:32,204;00:11:34,472;his family a lot of money.
148;00:11:36,875;00:11:39,844;But perhaps the gambler
148;00:11:36,875;00:11:39,844;loses his bet
149;00:11:39,878;00:11:42,113;and decides he does not
149;00:11:39,878;00:11:42,113;have to pay after all.
150;00:11:42,147;00:11:44,482;A destitute woman
150;00:11:42,147;00:11:44,482;and her small child,
151;00:11:44,516;00:11:48,319;what can they do to such a man
151;00:11:44,516;00:11:48,319;if he keeps their money for himself?
152;00:11:50,355;00:11:52,957;To whom can they turn
152;00:11:50,355;00:11:52,957;for recourse?
153;00:11:58,997;00:12:00,564;The Many-Faced God.
154;00:12:02,501;00:12:05,002;You said you didn't know
154;00:12:02,501;00:12:05,002;what I would see at the docks.
155;00:12:05,103;00:12:08,072;A man had no idea what a girl would see
155;00:12:05,103;00:12:08,072;and what she would not.
156;00:12:10,142;00:12:12,910;A girl named Lanna
156;00:12:10,142;00:12:12,910;will return to the docks.
157;00:12:12,944;00:12:14,678;She will watch
157;00:12:12,944;00:12:14,678;the gambler.
158;00:12:14,713;00:12:17,815;She will come to know as much about
158;00:12:14,713;00:12:17,815;him as she knows about herself.
159;00:12:17,849;00:12:20,384;And then what?
160;00:12:20,419;00:12:24,121;A gift for the thin man.
161;00:12:44,009;00:12:46,177;She's not ready.
162;00:12:46,211;00:12:49,280;Perhaps she is,
162;00:12:46,211;00:12:49,280;perhaps she's not.
163;00:12:49,314;00:12:51,615;And if she's not?
164;00:12:51,650;00:12:54,552;It is all the same
164;00:12:51,650;00:12:54,552;to the Many-Faced God.
165;00:13:17,576;00:13:19,944;The trial
165;00:13:17,576;00:13:19,944;will take place soon.

166;00:13:19,978;00:13:21,979;will be presenting
167;00:13:22,013;00:13:23,814;a substantial case
167;00:13:22,013;00:13:23,814;against you.
168;00:13:23,849;00:13:25,082;The charges?
169;00:13:25,117;00:13:27,485;Fornication,
169;00:13:25,117;00:13:27,485;treason, incest,
170;00:13:27,552;00:13:28,919;the murder
170;00:13:27,552;00:13:28,919;of King Robert.
171;00:13:28,954;00:13:30,254;All lies.
172;00:13:30,288;00:13:32,022;Of course,

173;00:13:36,595;00:13:40,464;My concern is that
173;00:13:36,595;00:13:40,464;the Faith does not adhere
174;00:13:40,499;00:13:43,934;to the same standards
174;00:13:40,499;00:13:43,934;of proof as the crown.
175;00:13:43,969;00:13:45,803;I hope you'll excuse me
175;00:13:43,969;00:13:45,803;for saying it,
176;00:13:45,837;00:13:48,472;but belief is so often
176;00:13:45,837;00:13:48,472;the death of reason.
177;00:13:48,507;00:13:50,441;I wish you had
177;00:13:48,507;00:13:50,441;said it sooner.
178;00:13:53,111;00:13:54,578;Is there any word
178;00:13:53,111;00:13:54,578;from Jaime?
179;00:13:54,613;00:13:57,148;No, I'm afraid not.
180;00:14:03,488;00:14:07,625;Your Grace,

182;00:14:09,861;00:14:11,395;back from Casterly Rock
183;00:14:11,429;00:14:12,897;to serve
183;00:14:11,429;00:14:12,897;as Hand of the King.
184;00:14:12,931;00:14:15,599;He now presides

185;00:14:16,968;00:14:19,236;Tell him I need
185;00:14:16,968;00:14:19,236;to speak to him.
186;00:14:19,271;00:14:21,705;I implored him to visit you,
186;00:14:19,271;00:14:21,705;but he would not.

189;00:14:31,149;00:14:33,684;and Queen Margaery's arrest,

190;00:14:33,718;00:14:35,085;taken them well.
191;00:14:35,153;00:14:37,021;He remains
191;00:14:35,153;00:14:37,021;in his chambers.
192;00:14:37,055;00:14:40,991;His servants often find
192;00:14:37,055;00:14:40,991;his food in the hall left untouched.
193;00:14:41,059;00:14:42,526;You need to talk to him.

194;00:14:42,561;00:14:44,828;to come and see me,
195;00:14:44,863;00:14:46,230;come and see his mother.
196;00:14:46,264;00:14:48,966;He-- I tried,

197;00:14:49,000;00:14:51,268;He wouldn't see me.
197;00:14:49,000;00:14:51,268;He won't see anyone.
198;00:14:52,637;00:14:54,371;I can't stay here.
199;00:14:55,574;00:14:58,709;There is a way,

202;00:15:09,621;00:15:11,121;To the High Sparrow?
203;00:15:11,156;00:15:13,290;I won't.
204;00:15:13,325;00:15:16,193;I made him.
205;00:15:16,228;00:15:18,162;I rose him up
205;00:15:16,228;00:15:18,162;from nothing.
206;00:15:18,196;00:15:20,998;I will not kneel before

207;00:15:21,032;00:15:23,500;and beg his forgiveness.
208;00:15:30,475;00:15:33,077;Good-bye, my queen.
209;00:15:34,479;00:15:36,513;The work continues.
210;00:16:11,716;00:16:13,751;Why?
211;00:16:15,420;00:16:16,887;Why, Theon?
212;00:16:16,921;00:16:20,057;I'm not Theon.
212;00:16:16,921;00:16:20,057;There is no Theon.
213;00:16:20,091;00:16:21,592;Reek.
213;00:16:20,091;00:16:21,592;Reek.
214;00:16:21,626;00:16:24,061;Why did you

215;00:16:25,130;00:16:27,364;I was helping you.
216;00:16:27,399;00:16:28,932;You wanted to escape.
217;00:16:28,967;00:16:31,869;There is no escape.
218;00:16:31,903;00:16:34,438;Not ever.
219;00:16:34,472;00:16:37,808;Theon Greyjoy
219;00:16:34,472;00:16:37,808;tried to escape.
220;00:16:37,876;00:16:39,677;The master knew.
221;00:16:40,612;00:16:43,314;He knows everything.
222;00:16:43,348;00:16:45,683;He hunted him
222;00:16:43,348;00:16:45,683;and caught him
223;00:16:45,717;00:16:48,018;and strapped him
223;00:16:45,717;00:16:48,018;to a cross
224;00:16:48,053;00:16:50,454;and cut away
224;00:16:48,053;00:16:50,454;piece after piece
225;00:16:50,488;00:16:52,890;until there
225;00:16:50,488;00:16:52,890;was no Theon left.
226;00:16:56,628;00:16:58,629;Good.

229;00:17:08,239;00:17:11,108;right now, I would.
230;00:17:15,480;00:17:17,214;I deserved everything.
231;00:17:19,551;00:17:21,585;I deserve to be Reek.
232;00:17:22,954;00:17:25,055;!
232;00:17:22,954;00:17:25,055;I did terrible things.
233;00:17:26,825;00:17:29,560;Turned on Robb.
234;00:17:29,594;00:17:32,096;Captured Winterfell.
235;00:17:32,163;00:17:34,665;Killed those boys.

238;00:17:38,703;00:17:40,270;They were only--
239;00:17:40,305;00:17:42,005;Only what?
240;00:17:42,040;00:17:43,841;I can't.
240;00:17:42,040;00:17:43,841;Tell me.
241;00:17:43,875;00:17:45,342;I can't, not unless
241;00:17:43,875;00:17:45,342;the master says.
242;00:17:45,377;00:17:46,744;Tell me. They weren't what?
242;00:17:45,377;00:17:46,744;They weren't--
243;00:17:46,778;00:17:49,613;Tell me why Bran
243;00:17:46,778;00:17:49,613;and Rickon should be gone
244;00:17:49,647;00:17:51,281;while you still
244;00:17:49,647;00:17:51,281;breathe the air.
245;00:17:51,316;00:17:52,549;Tell me
245;00:17:51,316;00:17:52,549;to my face, Theon.
246;00:17:52,584;00:17:54,418;Tell me that they

249;00:18:06,798;00:18:08,732;It was two farm boys.
250;00:18:12,737;00:18:15,839;I killed them and burned them
250;00:18:12,737;00:18:15,839;so no one would know.
251;00:18:20,712;00:18:23,313;You didn't?
252;00:18:23,348;00:18:25,582;Do you know where they went,
252;00:18:23,348;00:18:25,582;Bran and Rickon?
253;00:18:25,617;00:18:27,217;I can't talk
253;00:18:25,617;00:18:27,217;to you anymore.
254;00:18:27,252;00:18:28,986;Theon, you have to tell me.
254;00:18:27,252;00:18:28,986;Do you have any idea where--
255;00:18:29,053;00:18:31,488;Not Theon! Reek!
256;00:18:36,961;00:18:39,797;Our scouts tell us
256;00:18:36,961;00:18:39,797;he's got no more than 6,000 men.
257;00:18:39,831;00:18:42,299;More than half of those
257;00:18:39,831;00:18:42,299;are mounted, however.
258;00:18:42,333;00:18:45,302;And how high do
258;00:18:42,333;00:18:45,302;Stannis's horses jump?
259;00:18:45,336;00:18:47,704;Our walls have been
259;00:18:45,336;00:18:47,704;fully repaired.
260;00:18:47,739;00:18:49,706;The gates have been
260;00:18:47,739;00:18:49,706;reinforced.
261;00:18:49,741;00:18:52,810;We have enough food
261;00:18:49,741;00:18:52,810;for six months.
262;00:18:52,844;00:18:56,647;We are more prepared
262;00:18:52,844;00:18:56,647;for a siege than they could ever be.
263;00:18:56,681;00:18:59,283;All we have to do
263;00:18:56,681;00:18:59,283;is wait for them to freeze,
264;00:18:59,317;00:19:02,152;starve, and mutiny.
265;00:19:05,190;00:19:06,356;You disagree?
266;00:19:06,391;00:19:08,725;Stannis isn't
266;00:19:06,391;00:19:08,725;from the North.
267;00:19:08,760;00:19:10,794;You are, Father.
268;00:19:10,829;00:19:14,064;I think you're missing an opportunity
268;00:19:10,829;00:19:14,064;to show the people of the North
269;00:19:14,098;00:19:16,767;how House Bolton
269;00:19:14,098;00:19:16,767;treats southern invaders.
270;00:19:16,801;00:19:18,068;And what
270;00:19:16,801;00:19:18,068;do you recommend?
271;00:19:18,102;00:19:19,403;That we not sit
271;00:19:18,102;00:19:19,403;and wait for Stannis
272;00:19:19,437;00:19:21,972;to decide what sort of fight
272;00:19:19,437;00:19:21,972;this is going to be.
273;00:19:22,006;00:19:24,074;That we hit first
273;00:19:22,006;00:19:24,074;and hit hard
274;00:19:24,108;00:19:26,477;and leave a feast
274;00:19:24,108;00:19:26,477;for the crows.
275;00:19:26,511;00:19:29,513;A smart commander does not
275;00:19:26,511;00:19:29,513;abandon a defensive advantage.
276;00:19:29,547;00:19:31,915;As long as we stay
276;00:19:29,547;00:19:31,915;behind these walls,
277;00:19:31,950;00:19:33,250;they can't touch us.
278;00:19:33,284;00:19:35,185;Not to mention
278;00:19:33,284;00:19:35,185;that the snow is so deep,
279;00:19:35,220;00:19:36,954;we couldn't get
279;00:19:35,220;00:19:36,954;an army through to engage them
280;00:19:36,988;00:19:38,288;even if we wanted to.
281;00:19:38,323;00:19:40,591;I don't need an army.
282;00:19:40,625;00:19:43,126;I need 20 good men.
283;00:19:50,969;00:19:52,703;So, have you
283;00:19:50,969;00:19:52,703;decided yet?
284;00:19:52,737;00:19:55,205;Whether I'm worthy
284;00:19:52,737;00:19:55,205;of your service?
285;00:19:57,242;00:20:00,744;Have you decided yet
285;00:19:57,242;00:20:00,744;whether you're going to have me killed?
286;00:20:00,778;00:20:02,980;It's probably
286;00:20:00,778;00:20:02,980;my safest option.
287;00:20:05,850;00:20:08,051;I can see why
287;00:20:05,850;00:20:08,051;you would think so.
288;00:20:08,086;00:20:10,287;It's what your father
288;00:20:08,086;00:20:10,287;would have done.
289;00:20:11,556;00:20:12,996;And what would
289;00:20:11,556;00:20:12,996;your father have done?
290;00:20:15,093;00:20:16,660;My father,
291;00:20:16,694;00:20:19,663;who publically
291;00:20:16,694;00:20:19,663;sentenced me to death?
292;00:20:19,731;00:20:22,232;I'd say his thoughts on having me killed
292;00:20:19,731;00:20:22,232;were abundantly clear.
293;00:20:22,267;00:20:23,834;Is that why
293;00:20:22,267;00:20:23,834;you killed him?
294;00:20:27,205;00:20:30,474;Someday if you decide
294;00:20:27,205;00:20:30,474;not to execute me,
295;00:20:30,508;00:20:32,676;I'll tell you all about
295;00:20:30,508;00:20:32,676;why I killed my father.
296;00:20:32,710;00:20:35,946;And on that day,
296;00:20:32,710;00:20:35,946;should it ever come,
297;00:20:35,980;00:20:38,282;we'll need
297;00:20:35,980;00:20:38,282;more wine than this.
298;00:20:40,618;00:20:43,020;I know
298;00:20:40,618;00:20:43,020;what my father was.
299;00:20:43,087;00:20:45,589;What he did.
300;00:20:45,657;00:20:47,958;I know the Mad King
300;00:20:45,657;00:20:47,958;earned his name.
301;00:20:50,728;00:20:53,764;So, here we sit.
302;00:20:53,831;00:20:56,800;Two terrible children
302;00:20:53,831;00:20:56,800;of two terrible fathers.
303;00:20:56,834;00:20:58,535;I'm terrible?
304;00:20:58,570;00:21:00,704;I've heard stories.
305;00:21:00,738;00:21:04,074;Why did you travel to the far side
305;00:21:00,738;00:21:04,074;of the world to meet someone terrible?
306;00:21:04,075;00:21:06,199;To see if you were
306;00:21:04,075;00:21:06,199;the right kind of terrible.
307;00:21:06,200;00:21:06,840;Which kind is that?
308;00:21:06,844;00:21:09,947;The kind that prevents
308;00:21:06,844;00:21:09,947;your people from being even more so.
309;00:21:11,950;00:21:14,017;Well, I did reopen
309;00:21:11,950;00:21:14,017;the fighting pits.
310;00:21:14,052;00:21:16,853;Under my rule, murder will once again
310;00:21:14,052;00:21:16,853;become entertainment.
311;00:21:16,888;00:21:18,622;Yes, that was wise.
312;00:21:18,656;00:21:21,925;And you agreed to marry someone
312;00:21:18,656;00:21:21,925;you loathe for the greater good.
313;00:21:21,993;00:21:24,828;Very impressive.
314;00:21:24,862;00:21:27,397;My own sister married someone
314;00:21:24,862;00:21:27,397;she loathed as well,
315;00:21:27,432;00:21:29,967;though not by choice
315;00:21:27,432;00:21:29,967;and certainly not
316;00:21:30,001;00:21:31,935;for the greater good,
316;00:21:30,001;00:21:31,935;gods forbid.
317;00:21:31,970;00:21:33,704;She ended up
317;00:21:31,970;00:21:33,704;having him killed.
318;00:21:35,540;00:21:37,941;Perhaps it won't
318;00:21:35,540;00:21:37,941;come to that.
319;00:21:45,550;00:21:48,652;It's not impossible that Varys was right
319;00:21:45,550;00:21:48,652;about you after all.
320;00:21:48,686;00:21:51,855;Varys?
320;00:21:48,686;00:21:51,855;King Robert's spymaster?
321;00:21:51,923;00:21:55,425;Yes, he's the one
321;00:21:51,923;00:21:55,425;who convinced me to come find you.
322;00:21:55,460;00:21:57,060;He was my travelling
322;00:21:55,460;00:21:57,060;companion
323;00:21:57,095;00:21:59,396;before Ser Jorah seized
323;00:21:57,095;00:21:59,396;that role for himself.
324;00:21:59,430;00:22:02,099;Jorah sent my secrets
324;00:21:59,430;00:22:02,099;to Varys.
325;00:22:02,133;00:22:06,480;For 20 years the Spider oversaw
325;00:22:02,133;00:22:06,480;the campaign to find and kill me.
326;00:22:06,481;00:22:08,673;He did what he had
326;00:22:06,481;00:22:08,673;to do to survive.
327;00:22:08,706;00:22:11,842;He did a lot of other things as well,
327;00:22:08,706;00:22:11,842;things he didn't have to do.
328;00:22:11,876;00:22:15,779;I suspect he's the main reason
328;00:22:11,876;00:22:15,779;you weren't slaughtered in your crib.
329;00:22:15,813;00:22:17,581;But you trust him?
330;00:22:17,615;00:22:19,116;Yes, oddly.
331;00:22:19,150;00:22:22,386;He may be the only person
331;00:22:19,150;00:22:22,386;in the world I trust.
332;00:22:22,420;00:22:24,287;Except my brother.
333;00:22:24,322;00:22:27,357;The brother
333;00:22:24,322;00:22:27,357;who killed my father?
334;00:22:27,392;00:22:28,458;That's the one.
335;00:22:28,526;00:22:30,293;Perhaps I will have you
335;00:22:28,526;00:22:30,293;killed after all.
336;00:22:30,328;00:22:32,529;Your queenly prerogative.
337;00:22:34,632;00:22:37,167;I had given up on life
338;00:22:37,201;00:22:40,637;until Varys convinced me
338;00:22:37,201;00:22:40,637;you might be worth living for.
339;00:22:40,705;00:22:43,106;If you chop off
339;00:22:40,705;00:22:43,106;my head, well,
340;00:22:43,141;00:22:45,175;my final days
340;00:22:43,141;00:22:45,175;were interesting.
341;00:22:51,349;00:22:53,316;I'm not
341;00:22:51,349;00:22:53,316;going to kill you.
342;00:22:55,286;00:22:58,121;No? Banish me?
343;00:22:58,156;00:22:59,890;No.
344;00:22:59,924;00:23:01,591;So if I'm not going
344;00:22:59,924;00:23:01,591;to be murdered
345;00:23:01,626;00:23:03,026;and I'm not going
345;00:23:01,626;00:23:03,026;to be banished--
346;00:23:03,061;00:23:04,494;You're going
346;00:23:03,061;00:23:04,494;to advise me.
347;00:23:06,264;00:23:08,632;While you can still speak
347;00:23:06,264;00:23:08,632;in complete sentences.
348;00:23:12,570;00:23:13,904;Advise you on what?
349;00:23:13,938;00:23:15,505;How to get
349;00:23:13,938;00:23:15,505;what I want.
350;00:23:15,540;00:23:18,075;The Iron Throne.
351;00:23:18,109;00:23:21,078;Perhaps you should try
351;00:23:18,109;00:23:21,078;wanting something else.
352;00:23:21,112;00:23:23,580;If I want jokes,
352;00:23:21,112;00:23:23,580;I'll get myself a proper fool.
353;00:23:23,614;00:23:25,916;I'm not entirely joking.
354;00:23:25,950;00:23:28,418;There's more to the world
354;00:23:25,950;00:23:28,418;than Westeros after all.
355;00:23:28,453;00:23:32,789;How many hundreds of thousands of lives
355;00:23:28,453;00:23:32,789;have you changed for the better here?
356;00:23:32,824;00:23:34,725;Perhaps this
356;00:23:32,824;00:23:34,725;is where you belong,
357;00:23:34,759;00:23:36,760;where you can do
357;00:23:34,759;00:23:36,760;the most good.
358;00:23:38,930;00:23:41,665;I fought so that no child
358;00:23:38,930;00:23:41,665;born into Slaver's Bay
359;00:23:41,699;00:23:44,801;would ever know
359;00:23:41,699;00:23:44,801;what it meant to be bought or sold.
360;00:23:44,836;00:23:48,371;I will continue
360;00:23:44,836;00:23:48,371;that fight here and beyond.
361;00:23:48,406;00:23:49,973;But this is not my home.
362;00:23:50,007;00:23:52,743;When you get back to your home,
362;00:23:50,007;00:23:52,743;who supports you?
363;00:23:52,777;00:23:54,311;The common people.
364;00:23:54,345;00:23:56,947;Let's be generous
364;00:23:54,345;00:23:56,947;and assume that's going to happen.
365;00:23:56,981;00:23:59,649;Here in Slaver's Bay,
365;00:23:56,981;00:23:59,649;you had the support of the common people
366;00:23:59,684;00:24:02,119;and only
366;00:23:59,684;00:24:02,119;the common people.
367;00:24:02,153;00:24:06,022;What was that like?
367;00:24:02,153;00:24:06,022;Ruling without the rich?
368;00:24:06,057;00:24:08,525;House Targaryen is gone.
369;00:24:08,559;00:24:11,294;Not a single person who shares
369;00:24:08,559;00:24:11,294;your blood is alive to support you.
370;00:24:11,329;00:24:13,330;The Starks
370;00:24:11,329;00:24:13,330;are gone as well.
371;00:24:13,364;00:24:15,265;Our two terrible fathers
371;00:24:13,364;00:24:15,265;saw to that.
372;00:24:15,333;00:24:16,900;The remaining members
372;00:24:15,333;00:24:16,900;of House Lannister
373;00:24:16,968;00:24:18,969;will never back you,
373;00:24:16,968;00:24:18,969;not ever.
374;00:24:19,003;00:24:21,271;Stannis Baratheon
374;00:24:19,003;00:24:21,271;won't back you, either.
375;00:24:21,305;00:24:24,775;His entire claim to the throne rests on
375;00:24:21,305;00:24:24,775;the illegitimacy of yours.
376;00:24:24,809;00:24:26,910;That leaves the Tyrells.
377;00:24:26,944;00:24:29,579;Not impossible,
377;00:24:26,944;00:24:29,579;not enough.
378;00:24:29,647;00:24:33,717;Lannister, Targaryen,
378;00:24:29,647;00:24:33,717;Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell.
379;00:24:33,751;00:24:35,919;They're all just spokes
379;00:24:33,751;00:24:35,919;on a wheel.
380;00:24:35,953;00:24:38,255;This one's on top,
380;00:24:35,953;00:24:38,255;then that one's on top.
381;00:24:38,322;00:24:42,459;And on and on it spins, crushing
381;00:24:38,322;00:24:42,459;those on the ground.
382;00:24:42,493;00:24:46,229;It's a beautiful dream,
382;00:24:42,493;00:24:46,229;stopping the wheel.
383;00:24:46,264;00:24:48,932;You're not the first person
383;00:24:46,264;00:24:48,932;who's ever dreamt it.
384;00:24:48,966;00:24:51,902;I'm not going
384;00:24:48,966;00:24:51,902;to stop the wheel.
385;00:24:53,237;00:24:55,672;I'm going to break
385;00:24:53,237;00:24:55,672;the wheel.
386;00:25:18,196;00:25:22,566;You said whoever wins will fight
386;00:25:18,196;00:25:22,566;at the Great Pit in front of the queen.
387;00:25:22,600;00:25:24,534;I won.
388;00:25:24,569;00:25:25,424;You struck me.
389;00:25:25,448;00:25:27,737;Have me flogged
389;00:25:25,448;00:25:27,737;if it makes you happy.
390;00:25:27,738;00:25:30,907;But I'm the best
390;00:25:27,738;00:25:30,907;you've got.
391;00:25:30,942;00:25:33,743;If I win
391;00:25:30,942;00:25:33,743;at the Great Pit,
392;00:25:33,778;00:25:35,679;how much can you
392;00:25:33,778;00:25:35,679;sell me for?
393;00:25:38,549;00:25:40,083;You're a free man.
394;00:25:40,151;00:25:42,352;You could have
394;00:25:40,151;00:25:42,352;gone anywhere.
395;00:25:42,386;00:25:44,054;Why did you come back?
396;00:25:48,960;00:25:50,894;Let me fight for her
397;00:25:50,928;00:25:52,963;and I belong to you.
398;00:25:58,202;00:26:01,037;Thirsty?
399;00:26:01,105;00:26:02,973;Confess.
400;00:26:06,544;00:26:09,779;I'll get out of here,
400;00:26:06,544;00:26:09,779;you realize, before long.
401;00:26:09,814;00:26:11,014;Confess.
402;00:26:11,048;00:26:14,317;I can make you
402;00:26:11,048;00:26:14,317;a wealthy woman.
403;00:26:14,352;00:26:16,019;A lady of the court.
404;00:26:16,053;00:26:17,554;Confess.
405;00:26:22,193;00:26:25,862;Or I can make sure you die in the most
405;00:26:22,193;00:26:25,862;hideous way imaginable.
406;00:26:25,897;00:26:28,164;And all I do is sit here
407;00:26:28,199;00:26:31,034;imagining hideous ways
407;00:26:28,199;00:26:31,034;for you to die.
408;00:27:16,380;00:27:18,315;Does it hurt?
409;00:27:19,750;00:27:21,785;No.
410;00:27:21,819;00:27:24,020;Good.
411;00:27:27,258;00:27:29,326;How are you?
412;00:27:29,360;00:27:32,996;I'm not the one who got punched
412;00:27:29,360;00:27:32,996;and kicked in the face.
413;00:27:34,932;00:27:36,866;You know what I mean.
414;00:27:38,669;00:27:40,003;I'm good.
415;00:27:41,172;00:27:43,606;Are you scared?
415;00:27:41,172;00:27:43,606;A little.
416;00:27:43,641;00:27:45,608;Me, too.
417;00:27:49,347;00:27:51,047;Who's there?
417;00:27:49,347;00:27:51,047;Olly.
418;00:27:51,082;00:27:53,083;Oh.
419;00:27:53,117;00:27:54,985;Come in.
420;00:27:57,488;00:27:59,456;I heard what happened.
421;00:27:59,490;00:28:02,225;Oh, not to worry.
422;00:28:02,259;00:28:05,462;Men brawl from time to time.
422;00:28:02,259;00:28:05,462;It's only natural.
423;00:28:08,065;00:28:09,632;Figured you were hungry.
424;00:28:09,667;00:28:13,236;Oh, you're a good lad.
425;00:28:15,072;00:28:17,407;Wanted to ask you
425;00:28:15,072;00:28:17,407;something
426;00:28:17,441;00:28:19,275;if you've got the time.
427;00:28:19,310;00:28:21,611;I need to check
427;00:28:19,310;00:28:21,611;on baby Sam.
428;00:28:28,786;00:28:31,988;Now then,
428;00:28:28,786;00:28:31,988;how can I help?
429;00:28:33,457;00:28:35,392;It's about the Lord Commander.
429;00:28:33,457;00:28:35,392;Yes?
430;00:28:35,426;00:28:38,495;He's going up to Hardhome
430;00:28:35,426;00:28:38,495;to save all them wildlings.
431;00:28:40,431;00:28:43,700;Wildlings killed
431;00:28:40,431;00:28:43,700;my mom and dad.
432;00:28:43,734;00:28:45,435;They killed everyone
432;00:28:43,734;00:28:45,435;in my village.
433;00:28:45,469;00:28:47,203;We've been
433;00:28:45,469;00:28:47,203;fighting them for years.
434;00:28:47,271;00:28:48,872;This wasn't a fight.
435;00:28:48,906;00:28:52,409;We were farmers
435;00:28:48,906;00:28:52,409;and they slaughtered us.
436;00:28:54,011;00:28:55,745;So why is he saving them?
437;00:28:56,360;00:28:58,561;Wildlings are people.
438;00:28:58,595;00:29:01,931;Just like us, there are good ones
438;00:28:58,595;00:29:01,931;and bad ones.
439;00:29:01,965;00:29:05,334;The one he's travelling with,
439;00:29:01,965;00:29:05,334;the one with the red beard,
440;00:29:05,369;00:29:07,336;he led the raid
440;00:29:05,369;00:29:07,336;on my village.
441;00:29:07,371;00:29:09,672;Oh, Olly.
441;00:29:07,371;00:29:09,672;How can he trust him?
442;00:29:11,108;00:29:13,776;I've seen the army
442;00:29:11,108;00:29:13,776;of the dead.
443;00:29:13,810;00:29:16,812;I've seen
443;00:29:13,810;00:29:16,812;the white walkers.
444;00:29:16,847;00:29:19,582;And they're coming for us,
444;00:29:16,847;00:29:19,582;for all the living.
445;00:29:21,852;00:29:25,021;And when it's time,
446;00:29:25,055;00:29:28,057;we'll need every
446;00:29:25,055;00:29:28,057;last man we can find.
447;00:29:28,091;00:29:31,060;But what if we let
447;00:29:28,091;00:29:31,060;the wildlings through the gates
448;00:29:31,161;00:29:32,962;and they cut our throats
448;00:29:31,161;00:29:32,962;while we sleep?
449;00:29:32,996;00:29:35,364;Jon's taking a risk,
449;00:29:32,996;00:29:35,364;but he has to.
450;00:29:35,399;00:29:38,100;We don't stand
450;00:29:35,399;00:29:38,100;a chance otherwise.
451;00:29:38,135;00:29:42,071;Sometimes a man
451;00:29:38,135;00:29:42,071;has to make hard choices,
452;00:29:42,105;00:29:44,006;choices that might look
452;00:29:42,105;00:29:44,006;wrong to others,
453;00:29:44,041;00:29:46,809;but you know are right
453;00:29:44,041;00:29:46,809;in the long run.
454;00:29:46,843;00:29:48,544;You believe that?
455;00:29:48,578;00:29:50,713;With all my heart.
456;00:29:57,287;00:29:59,555;Try not to worry, Olly.
457;00:29:59,589;00:30:02,558;I've been worrying
457;00:29:59,589;00:30:02,558;about Jon for years.
458;00:30:02,592;00:30:04,560;He always comes back.
459;00:30:46,837;00:30:48,838;Turn us about!
460;00:31:21,438;00:31:24,039;You trust me,
460;00:31:21,438;00:31:24,039;Jon Snow?
461;00:31:24,074;00:31:26,242;Does that
461;00:31:24,074;00:31:26,242;make me a fool?
462;00:31:26,276;00:31:28,544;We're fools
462;00:31:26,276;00:31:28,544;together now.
463;00:31:45,028;00:31:47,930;Lord of Bones.
464;00:31:47,998;00:31:50,399;Been a long time.
465;00:31:50,433;00:31:53,302;Last time I saw you,
465;00:31:50,433;00:31:53,302;the little crow was your prisoner.
466;00:31:53,336;00:31:55,704;The other way around now.
466;00:31:53,336;00:31:55,704;What happened?
467;00:31:55,739;00:31:57,339;War.
468;00:31:57,374;00:32:00,276;War?
468;00:31:57,374;00:32:00,276;You call that a war?
469;00:32:00,310;00:32:02,478;The greatest army
469;00:32:00,310;00:32:02,478;the North has ever seen
470;00:32:02,512;00:32:05,514;cut to pieces
470;00:32:02,512;00:32:05,514;by some southern king.
471;00:32:05,549;00:32:07,683;We should gather
471;00:32:05,549;00:32:07,683;the elders,
472;00:32:07,717;00:32:09,618;find somewhere
472;00:32:07,717;00:32:09,618;quiet to talk.
473;00:32:09,686;00:32:11,554;You don't give
473;00:32:09,686;00:32:11,554;the orders here.
474;00:32:11,588;00:32:13,622;I'm not giving an order.
475;00:32:15,325;00:32:17,159;Why aren't you
475;00:32:15,325;00:32:17,159;in chains?
476;00:32:18,128;00:32:20,563;He's not my prisoner.
477;00:32:20,597;00:32:21,831;No?
478;00:32:21,865;00:32:23,699;What is he?
479;00:32:23,733;00:32:25,434;We're allies.
480;00:32:27,003;00:32:29,705;You fucking traitor.
481;00:32:32,709;00:32:34,510;You fight
481;00:32:32,709;00:32:34,510;for the crows now?
482;00:32:36,613;00:32:39,148;I don't fight
482;00:32:36,613;00:32:39,148;for the crows.
483;00:32:40,550;00:32:44,053;We're not here to fight.
483;00:32:40,550;00:32:44,053;We're here to talk.
484;00:32:44,120;00:32:46,488;Is that right?
485;00:32:46,523;00:32:49,892;You and the pretty crow
485;00:32:46,523;00:32:49,892;do a lot of talking, Tormund?
486;00:32:49,926;00:32:52,061;And when
486;00:32:49,926;00:32:52,061;you're done talking,
487;00:32:52,095;00:32:54,730;do you get down on your knees
487;00:32:52,095;00:32:54,730;and suck his cock?
488;00:33:10,413;00:33:13,515;Gather the elders
488;00:33:10,413;00:33:13,515;and let's talk.
489;00:33:39,409;00:33:41,777;My name's Jon Snow.
490;00:33:43,346;00:33:45,614;I'm Lord Commander
490;00:33:43,346;00:33:45,614;of the Night's Watch.
491;00:33:48,351;00:33:50,686;We're not friends.
492;00:33:50,720;00:33:53,206;We've never been friends.
493;00:33:54,211;00:33:55,864;We won't become
493;00:33:54,211;00:33:55,864;friends today.
494;00:33:58,061;00:34:00,162;This isn't
494;00:33:58,061;00:34:00,162;about friendship.
495;00:34:02,032;00:34:04,199;This is about
495;00:34:02,032;00:34:04,199;survival.
496;00:34:04,234;00:34:06,268;This is about putting
496;00:34:04,234;00:34:06,268;a 700-foot wall
497;00:34:06,303;00:34:08,871;between you
497;00:34:06,303;00:34:08,871;and what's out there.
498;00:34:08,905;00:34:10,606;You built that wall
498;00:34:08,905;00:34:10,606;to keep us out.
499;00:34:10,640;00:34:13,609;Since when do the crows
499;00:34:10,640;00:34:13,609;give two shits if we live?
500;00:34:13,677;00:34:16,512;In normal times we wouldn't.
500;00:34:13,677;00:34:16,512;But these aren't normal times.
501;00:34:16,546;00:34:19,949;The white walkers
501;00:34:16,546;00:34:19,949;don't care if a man's free folk or crow.
502;00:34:19,983;00:34:23,118;We're all the same to them,
502;00:34:19,983;00:34:23,118;meat for their army.
503;00:34:23,186;00:34:25,321;But together
503;00:34:23,186;00:34:25,321;we can beat them.
504;00:34:25,355;00:34:27,489;Beat the white walkers?
505;00:34:27,524;00:34:30,392;Good luck with that.
505;00:34:27,524;00:34:30,392;Run from them, maybe.
506;00:34:40,203;00:34:42,304;It's not a trick.
507;00:34:45,075;00:34:48,143;It's a gift
507;00:34:45,075;00:34:48,143;for those who join us.
508;00:34:53,016;00:34:55,985;Dragonglass.
509;00:34:56,019;00:34:59,021;A man of the Night's Watch
509;00:34:56,019;00:34:59,021;used one of these daggers
510;00:34:59,055;00:35:01,123;to kill a walker.
511;00:35:01,157;00:35:03,592;You saw this?
511;00:35:01,157;00:35:03,592;No.
512;00:35:03,660;00:35:05,194;But I trust the man.
513;00:35:05,228;00:35:07,763;There are old stories
513;00:35:05,228;00:35:07,763;about dragonglass.
514;00:35:07,797;00:35:11,266;There are old stories
514;00:35:07,797;00:35:11,266;about ice spiders as big as hounds.
515;00:35:11,301;00:35:13,469;And with the things
515;00:35:11,301;00:35:13,469;we've seen, you don't believe them?
516;00:35:13,503;00:35:16,305;Come with me and I'll share
516;00:35:13,503;00:35:16,305;these weapons.
517;00:35:16,339;00:35:17,873;Come with you where?
518;00:35:17,907;00:35:19,675;There are good lands
518;00:35:17,907;00:35:19,675;south of the Wall.
519;00:35:19,709;00:35:21,477;The Night's Watch will let you
519;00:35:19,709;00:35:21,477;through the tunnel
520;00:35:21,511;00:35:23,912;and allow your people
520;00:35:21,511;00:35:23,912;to farm those lands.
521;00:35:27,017;00:35:29,184;I knew Mance Rayder.
522;00:35:29,252;00:35:31,387;He never wanted a war
522;00:35:29,252;00:35:31,387;with the Night's Watch.
523;00:35:31,421;00:35:33,922;He wanted a new life
523;00:35:31,421;00:35:33,922;for his people, for you.
524;00:35:33,957;00:35:36,392;We're prepared
524;00:35:33,957;00:35:36,392;to give you that new life.
525;00:35:36,426;00:35:38,060;If?
526;00:35:38,094;00:35:41,397;If you swear you'll join us
526;00:35:38,094;00:35:41,397;when the real war begins.
527;00:35:43,833;00:35:45,401;Where is Mance?
528;00:35:48,738;00:35:51,507;He died.
528;00:35:48,738;00:35:51,507;How?
529;00:35:56,746;00:35:58,747;I put an arrow
529;00:35:56,746;00:35:58,747;through his heart.
530;00:35:58,782;00:36:01,016;Hey, hey.
531;00:36:01,084;00:36:03,118;Hey, hey, hey,
531;00:36:01,084;00:36:03,118;hey, hey.
532;00:36:05,288;00:36:06,688;Hey, hey, hey.
533;00:36:06,723;00:36:08,357;I say we send
533;00:36:06,723;00:36:08,357;the Lord Commander
534;00:36:08,391;00:36:12,194;back to Castle Black
534;00:36:08,391;00:36:12,194;with no eyes.
535;00:36:13,830;00:36:16,131;Hey, none of you
535;00:36:13,830;00:36:16,131;saw Mance die.
536;00:36:16,199;00:36:17,866;I did.
537;00:36:17,901;00:36:21,303;The southern king
537;00:36:17,901;00:36:21,303;who broke our army, Stannis,
538;00:36:21,337;00:36:23,972;wanted to burn him alive
538;00:36:21,337;00:36:23,972;to send us a message.
539;00:36:24,007;00:36:26,975;Jon Snow defied
539;00:36:24,007;00:36:26,975;that cunt's orders.
540;00:36:28,211;00:36:30,379;His arrow was mercy.
541;00:36:31,481;00:36:32,781;What he did
541;00:36:31,481;00:36:32,781;took courage.
542;00:36:32,816;00:36:34,516;And that's
542;00:36:32,816;00:36:34,516;what we need today,
543;00:36:34,551;00:36:36,185;the courage
543;00:36:34,551;00:36:36,185;to make peace
544;00:36:36,219;00:36:39,455;with men we've been killing
544;00:36:36,219;00:36:39,455;for generations.
545;00:36:39,489;00:36:41,690;I lost my father,
545;00:36:39,489;00:36:41,690;my uncle,
546;00:36:41,724;00:36:44,093;and two brothers
546;00:36:41,724;00:36:44,093;fighting the damn crows.
547;00:36:44,127;00:36:47,229;I'm not asking you
547;00:36:44,127;00:36:47,229;to forget your dead.
548;00:36:47,263;00:36:49,364;I'll never
548;00:36:47,263;00:36:49,364;forget mine.
549;00:36:51,201;00:36:55,471;I lost 50 brothers
549;00:36:51,201;00:36:55,471;the night that Mance attacked the Wall.
550;00:36:56,439;00:36:58,740;But I'm asking you
551;00:36:58,775;00:37:00,843;to think about
551;00:36:58,775;00:37:00,843;your children now.
552;00:37:02,712;00:37:04,346;They'll never have
552;00:37:02,712;00:37:04,346;children of their own
553;00:37:04,380;00:37:06,815;if we don't band together.
554;00:37:06,883;00:37:09,685;The Long Night
554;00:37:06,883;00:37:09,685;is coming
555;00:37:09,719;00:37:11,687;and the dead
555;00:37:09,719;00:37:11,687;come with it.
556;00:37:11,721;00:37:14,423;No clan can stop them.
557;00:37:14,457;00:37:16,291;The free folk
557;00:37:14,457;00:37:16,291;can't stop them.
558;00:37:16,326;00:37:17,726;The Night's Watch
558;00:37:16,326;00:37:17,726;can't stop them.
559;00:37:17,794;00:37:21,196;And all the southern kings
559;00:37:17,794;00:37:21,196;can't stop them.
560;00:37:22,332;00:37:24,933;Only together,
560;00:37:22,332;00:37:24,933;all of us.
561;00:37:24,968;00:37:26,702;And even then
561;00:37:24,968;00:37:26,702;it may not be enough,
562;00:37:26,736;00:37:29,004;but at least we'll give
562;00:37:26,736;00:37:29,004;the fuckers a fight.
563;00:37:44,521;00:37:47,089;You vouch
563;00:37:44,521;00:37:47,089;for this man, Tormund?
564;00:37:49,659;00:37:52,661;He's prettier
564;00:37:49,659;00:37:52,661;than both my daughters,
565;00:37:52,695;00:37:54,563;but he knows
565;00:37:52,695;00:37:54,563;how to fight.
566;00:37:54,597;00:37:57,466;He's young,
566;00:37:54,597;00:37:57,466;but he knows how to lead.
567;00:37:58,968;00:38:00,636;He didn't have
567;00:37:58,968;00:38:00,636;to come to Hardhome.
568;00:38:00,670;00:38:04,806;He came because
568;00:38:00,670;00:38:04,806;he needs us
569;00:38:04,841;00:38:06,875;and we need him.
570;00:38:10,747;00:38:12,781;My ancestors
570;00:38:10,747;00:38:12,781;would spit on me
571;00:38:12,815;00:38:14,950;if I broke bread
571;00:38:12,815;00:38:14,950;with a crow.
572;00:38:14,984;00:38:17,853;So would mine,
572;00:38:14,984;00:38:17,853;but fuck 'em, they're dead.
573;00:38:27,230;00:38:29,531;I'll never trust
573;00:38:27,230;00:38:29,531;a man in black.
574;00:38:33,636;00:38:36,138;But I trust you,
574;00:38:33,636;00:38:36,138;Tormund.
575;00:38:36,172;00:38:39,508;If you say
575;00:38:36,172;00:38:39,508;this is the way,
576;00:38:39,542;00:38:40,809;we're with you.
577;00:38:44,881;00:38:47,482;This is the way.
578;00:38:48,518;00:38:50,319;I'm with Tormund.
579;00:38:50,353;00:38:52,688;We stay here,
579;00:38:50,353;00:38:52,688;we're dead men.
580;00:38:54,390;00:38:57,392;At least with King Crow,
580;00:38:54,390;00:38:57,392;there's a chance.
581;00:39:00,096;00:39:03,232;Tormund.
582;00:39:06,269;00:39:09,071;Keep that new life
582;00:39:06,269;00:39:09,071;you want to give us.
583;00:39:11,808;00:39:14,409;And keep your glass,
583;00:39:11,808;00:39:14,409;King Crow.
584;00:39:16,512;00:39:20,249;As soon as you get on
584;00:39:16,512;00:39:20,249;his ships, they're gonna slit your throats
585;00:39:20,283;00:39:23,252;and dump your bodies
585;00:39:20,283;00:39:23,252;to the bottom of the Shivering Sea.
586;00:39:25,255;00:39:27,256;That's our enemy.
587;00:39:28,891;00:39:31,026;That has always
587;00:39:28,891;00:39:31,026;been our enemy.
588;00:39:46,909;00:39:48,710;I fucking hate Thenns.
589;00:40:08,665;00:40:11,199;Move it.
589;00:40:08,665;00:40:11,199;Be careful.
590;00:40:11,234;00:40:13,101;- Move 'em along, now.
590;00:40:11,234;00:40:13,101;- Cast-off time.
591;00:40:13,136;00:40:15,103;That's it, come on.
592;00:40:17,807;00:40:20,275;How many are with us?
592;00:40:17,807;00:40:20,275;5,000?
593;00:40:20,310;00:40:22,477;I'm not good
593;00:40:20,310;00:40:22,477;at counting.
594;00:40:23,813;00:40:25,514;We're leaving
594;00:40:23,813;00:40:25,514;too many behind.
595;00:40:25,548;00:40:27,049;The free folk
595;00:40:25,548;00:40:27,049;are stubborn.
596;00:40:27,083;00:40:29,584;You know how long
596;00:40:27,083;00:40:29,584;it took Mance to band them together?
597;00:40:29,619;00:40:32,120;20 fucking years.
598;00:40:32,188;00:40:35,190;And he knew them better
598;00:40:32,188;00:40:35,190;than I ever will.
599;00:40:35,224;00:40:39,494;They're running out of food
599;00:40:35,224;00:40:39,494;and there's nothing to hunt.
600;00:40:39,529;00:40:41,029;They'll come around.
601;00:40:43,866;00:40:46,368;- Get yourselves ready.
601;00:40:43,866;00:40:46,368;- Aye!
602;00:40:46,402;00:40:48,170;Johnna is gonna
602;00:40:46,402;00:40:48,170;look after you.
603;00:40:48,204;00:40:50,972;She's in charge.
603;00:40:48,204;00:40:50,972;You listen to her.
604;00:40:52,075;00:40:54,676;Take her.
604;00:40:52,075;00:40:54,676;There you are.
605;00:40:54,711;00:40:56,044;I want to go with you.
606;00:40:56,079;00:40:58,714;I need to get
606;00:40:56,079;00:40:58,714;the old folks on the boats.
607;00:40:58,748;00:41:00,982;I'm right behind you.
607;00:40:58,748;00:41:00,982;I promise.
608;00:41:04,887;00:41:06,521;Go on.
609;00:41:08,925;00:41:10,125;Another one.
610;00:41:10,159;00:41:13,061;Keep moving.
610;00:41:10,159;00:41:13,061;We'll meet you out there.
611;00:41:15,732;00:41:18,367;Won't be able to take that on the boat.
611;00:41:15,732;00:41:18,367;It's too big.
612;00:41:18,401;00:41:21,903;That's the last one!
612;00:41:18,401;00:41:21,903;Three more! Move on!
613;00:41:21,938;00:41:25,507;There's more dragonglass everywhere.
614;00:41:31,748;00:41:34,516;I've got some more daggers
614;00:41:31,748;00:41:34,516;over here.
615;00:41:34,550;00:41:36,985;Put that dagger
615;00:41:34,550;00:41:36,985;in his bag.
