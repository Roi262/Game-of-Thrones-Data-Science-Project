1;00:02:30,278;00:02:33,179;Despite appearances, I think you'll
﻿1;00:02:30,278;00:02:33,179;find the city's on the rise.
2;00:02:36,251;00:02:38,351;Perhaps we should take shelter.
3;00:02:39,621;00:02:41,654;The city's on the rise?
4;00:02:41,756;00:02:43,523;Meereen is strong.
5;00:02:43,625;00:02:45,492;Commerce has returned to the markets.
6;00:02:45,593;00:02:48,128;The people are behind you.
7;00:02:50,065;00:02:51,931;Well, not all the people, of course.
8;00:02:52,034;00:02:55,101;No ruler that ever lived had
8;00:02:52,034;00:02:55,101;the support of all the people.
9;00:02:55,203;00:02:59,539;But the rebirth of Meereen is
9;00:02:55,203;00:02:59,539;the cause of this violence.
10;00:03:00,808;00:03:03,876;The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed.
11;00:03:03,978;00:03:07,180;Because if Meereen succeeds,
11;00:03:03,978;00:03:07,180;a city without slavery,
12;00:03:07,282;00:03:10,483;a city without Masters...
13;00:03:10,585;00:03:13,253;...it proves that no one needs a Master.
14;00:03:16,124;00:03:18,091;Good.
15;00:03:18,193;00:03:20,060;Shall we begin?
16;00:03:21,596;00:03:23,363;Do we have a plan?
17;00:03:23,465;00:03:25,432;I will crucify the Masters.
18;00:03:25,534;00:03:27,300;I will set their fleets afire,
19;00:03:27,402;00:03:29,202;kill every last one of their soldiers,
20;00:03:29,304;00:03:31,404;and return their cities to the dirt.
21;00:03:31,506;00:03:33,873;That is my plan.
22;00:03:35,310;00:03:37,710;You don't approve?
23;00:03:37,812;00:03:40,146;You once told me you knew
23;00:03:37,812;00:03:40,146;what your father was.
24;00:03:40,248;00:03:42,882;Did you know his plans
24;00:03:40,248;00:03:42,882;for King's Landing
25;00:03:42,984;00:03:45,351;when the Lannister armies
25;00:03:42,984;00:03:45,351;were at his gates?
26;00:03:48,256;00:03:50,656;Probably not.
27;00:03:50,758;00:03:53,093;Well, he told my brother
27;00:03:50,758;00:03:53,093;and Jaime told me.
28;00:03:53,195;00:03:56,829;He had caches of wildfire
28;00:03:53,195;00:03:56,829;hidden under the Red Keep,
29;00:03:56,931;00:03:59,432;the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor,
30;00:03:59,534;00:04:01,534;all the major thoroughfares.
31;00:04:03,271;00:04:05,738;He would have burned every
31;00:04:03,271;00:04:05,738;one of his citizens.
32;00:04:05,840;00:04:08,174;The loyal ones and the traitors.
33;00:04:08,276;00:04:10,577;Every man, woman, and child.
34;00:04:10,678;00:04:12,112;That's why Jaime killed him.
35;00:04:12,214;00:04:13,480;This is entirely different.
36;00:04:13,582;00:04:15,615;You're talking about destroying cities.
37;00:04:15,717;00:04:17,817;It's not entirely different.
38;00:04:21,623;00:04:25,158;I'd like to suggest an
38;00:04:21,623;00:04:25,158;alternate approach.
39;00:04:38,740;00:04:41,073;Once before, I offered you peace.
40;00:04:41,176;00:04:43,543;If you had not been so arrogant,
41;00:04:43,645;00:04:47,580;you could have returned to your
41;00:04:43,645;00:04:47,580;homeland with a fleet of ships.
42;00:04:49,618;00:04:54,262;Instead, you will flee
42;00:04:49,618;00:04:54,262;Slaver's Bay on foot
43;00:04:54,263;00:04:55,955;like the beggar queen you are.
44;00:04:56,057;00:04:59,125;We are here to discuss
44;00:04:56,057;00:04:59,125;terms of surrender,
45;00:04:59,227;00:05:01,594;not to trade insults.
46;00:05:01,696;00:05:03,596;The terms are simple.
47;00:05:03,698;00:05:08,835;You and your foreign friends will abandon
47;00:05:03,698;00:05:08,835;the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen.
48;00:05:08,836;00:05:11,337;The Unsullied you stole
48;00:05:08,836;00:05:11,337;from Kraznys mo Nakloz
49;00:05:11,439;00:05:14,340;will remain to be sold again
49;00:05:11,439;00:05:14,340;to the highest bidder.
50;00:05:14,442;00:05:17,477;The translator you stole from
50;00:05:14,442;00:05:17,477;Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain
51;00:05:17,579;00:05:19,912;to be sold again to the highest bidder.
52;00:05:20,014;00:05:23,883;The dragons beneath the Great
52;00:05:20,014;00:05:23,883;Pyramid will be slaughtered.
53;00:05:25,420;00:05:27,853;We obviously didn't communicate clearly.
54;00:05:27,955;00:05:30,823;We're here to discuss
54;00:05:27,955;00:05:30,823;your surrender, not mine.
55;00:05:34,429;00:05:36,663;I imagine it's difficult
56;00:05:36,764;00:05:39,332;adjusting to the new reality.
57;00:05:41,736;00:05:44,970;Your reign is over.
58;00:05:47,141;00:05:50,376;My reign has just begun.
59;00:08:28,370;00:08:29,569;Dracarys.
60;00:09:13,528;00:09:15,181;Your men have a choice:
61;00:09:17,035;00:09:23,183;fight and die for masters who would
61;00:09:17,035;00:09:23,183;never fight and die for you,
62;00:09:23,184;00:09:26,968;or go home to your families.
63;00:09:33,167;00:09:35,334;Thank you for the armada.
64;00:09:35,437;00:09:37,202;Our queen does love ships.
65;00:09:37,305;00:09:42,341;Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact.
66;00:09:42,444;00:09:44,544;You violated that pact.
67;00:09:44,646;00:09:46,312;You declared war upon us.
68;00:09:46,414;00:09:48,681;Though our queen does
68;00:09:46,414;00:09:48,681;have a forgiving nature,
69;00:09:48,783;00:09:51,984;this cannot be forgiven.
70;00:09:52,086;00:09:54,954;Our queen insists that
70;00:09:52,086;00:09:54,954;one of you must die
71;00:09:55,056;00:09:57,457;as punishment for your crimes.
72;00:09:58,927;00:10:02,061;It always seems a bit
72;00:09:58,927;00:10:02,061;abstract, doesn't it,
73;00:10:02,163;00:10:03,930;other people dying?
74;00:10:05,733;00:10:07,800;Him. He should die.
75;00:10:07,902;00:10:10,169;Yes, him. He's not one of us.
76;00:10:10,271;00:10:11,838;He's an outsider, a lowborn.
77;00:10:11,940;00:10:13,940;He does not speak for us.
78;00:10:17,178;00:10:19,078;Please.
79;00:10:20,715;00:10:22,281;Please.
80;00:10:41,002;00:10:43,302;Tell your people what happened here.
81;00:10:44,839;00:10:48,140;Tell them you live by the
81;00:10:44,839;00:10:48,140;grace of Her Majesty.
82;00:10:48,242;00:10:50,376;When they come forward with
82;00:10:48,242;00:10:50,376;notions of retribution
83;00:10:50,478;00:10:54,881;or ideas about returning the slave
83;00:10:50,478;00:10:54,881;cities to their former glory,
84;00:10:54,983;00:10:57,082;remind them what happened
85;00:10:57,184;00:11:00,820;when Daenerys Stormborn and
85;00:10:57,184;00:11:00,820;her dragons came to Meereen.
86;00:11:35,857;00:11:38,624;You don't have to be here.
87;00:11:38,726;00:11:40,760;Yes, I do.
88;00:12:05,553;00:12:07,453;My beloved wife.
89;00:12:09,857;00:12:11,891;I've missed you terribly.
90;00:12:15,296;00:12:18,464;Thank you for returning
90;00:12:15,296;00:12:18,464;Lady Bolton safely.
91;00:12:18,566;00:12:21,266;Now, dismount and kneel before me,
92;00:12:21,368;00:12:26,473;surrender your army and proclaim me the true
92;00:12:21,368;00:12:26,473;Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.
93;00:12:26,474;00:12:28,440;I will pardon you for
93;00:12:26,474;00:12:28,440;deserting the Night's Watch.
94;00:12:28,542;00:12:32,544;I will pardon these treasonous
94;00:12:28,542;00:12:32,544;lords for betraying my house.
95;00:12:35,717;00:12:38,150;Come, bastard,
96;00:12:38,252;00:12:41,053;you don't have the men, you
96;00:12:38,252;00:12:41,053;don't have the horses,
97;00:12:41,155;00:12:43,355;and you don't have Winterfell.
98;00:12:43,457;00:12:47,093;Why lead those poor
98;00:12:43,457;00:12:47,093;souls into slaughter?
99;00:12:47,194;00:12:49,895;There's no need for a battle.
100;00:12:49,998;00:12:52,932;Get off your horse and kneel.
101;00:12:54,836;00:12:56,636;I'm a man of mercy.
102;00:13:01,676;00:13:03,342;You're right.
103;00:13:03,444;00:13:05,577;There's no need for a battle.
104;00:13:06,981;00:13:09,749;Thousands of men don't need to die.
105;00:13:11,786;00:13:13,452;Only one of us.
106;00:13:15,890;00:13:17,823;Let's end this the old way.
107;00:13:17,925;00:13:19,992;You against me.
108;00:13:32,006;00:13:35,274;I keep hearing stories
108;00:13:32,006;00:13:35,274;about you, bastard.
109;00:13:35,376;00:13:37,509;The way people in the
109;00:13:35,376;00:13:37,509;North talk about you,
110;00:13:37,611;00:13:39,879;you're the greatest
110;00:13:37,611;00:13:39,879;swordsman who ever walked.
111;00:13:41,082;00:13:43,382;Maybe you are that good.
112;00:13:43,484;00:13:45,584;Maybe not.
113;00:13:45,687;00:13:48,220;I don't know if I'd beat you.
114;00:13:48,322;00:13:51,490;But I know that my army will beat yours.
115;00:13:52,178;00:13:53,693;I have 6,000 men.
116;00:13:53,795;00:13:57,782;You have, what, half that?
117;00:13:57,783;00:13:58,664;Not even?
118;00:13:58,766;00:14:00,800;Aye, you have the numbers.
119;00:14:02,236;00:14:03,736;Will your men want to fight for you
120;00:14:03,838;00:14:06,739;when they hear you
120;00:14:03,838;00:14:06,739;wouldn't fight for them?
121;00:14:14,849;00:14:17,416;He's good. Very good.
122;00:14:19,053;00:14:21,453;Tell me, will you let
122;00:14:19,053;00:14:21,453;your little brother die
123;00:14:21,555;00:14:23,756;because you're too proud to surrender?
124;00:14:23,858;00:14:25,825;How do we know you have him?
125;00:14:51,352;00:14:52,918;Now, if you want to save...
126;00:14:53,020;00:14:55,587;You're going to die
126;00:14:53,020;00:14:55,587;tomorrow, Lord Bolton.
127;00:14:58,793;00:15:00,592;Sleep well.
128;00:15:08,836;00:15:11,703;She's a fine woman, your sister.
129;00:15:12,307;00:15:14,874;I look forward to having
129;00:15:12,307;00:15:14,874;her back in my bed.
130;00:15:18,345;00:15:20,813;And you're all fine-looking men.
131;00:15:20,915;00:15:23,048;My dogs are desperate to meet you.
132;00:15:23,151;00:15:26,319;I haven't fed them for
132;00:15:23,151;00:15:26,319;seven days. They're ravenous.
133;00:15:26,320;00:15:29,321;I wonder which parts they'll try first.
134;00:15:29,423;00:15:31,824;Your eyes?
135;00:15:31,926;00:15:33,392;Your balls?
136;00:15:35,396;00:15:37,997;We'll find out soon enough.
137;00:15:38,876;00:15:42,434;In the morning, then, bastard.
138;00:15:59,553;00:16:01,620;If he was smart, he'd stay inside
139;00:16:01,722;00:16:03,488;the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.
140;00:16:03,590;00:16:06,525;That's not his way. He knows
140;00:16:03,590;00:16:06,525;the North is watching.
141;00:16:06,627;00:16:09,461;If the other houses sense
141;00:16:06,627;00:16:09,461;weakness on his part,
142;00:16:09,563;00:16:11,297;they'll stop fearing him.
143;00:16:11,398;00:16:14,066;He can't have that. Fear is his power.
144;00:16:14,168;00:16:16,735;It's his weakness, too. His men
144;00:16:14,168;00:16:16,735;don't want to fight for him.
145;00:16:16,838;00:16:19,438;They're forced to fight for him.
145;00:16:16,838;00:16:19,438;If they feel the tide turning...
146;00:16:19,540;00:16:21,874;It's not his men that worry me.
147;00:16:21,976;00:16:23,309;It's his horses.
148;00:16:23,410;00:16:25,577;I know what mounted
148;00:16:23,410;00:16:25,577;knights can do to us.
149;00:16:25,679;00:16:28,780;You and Stannis cut through
149;00:16:25,679;00:16:28,780;us like piss through snow.
150;00:16:28,883;00:16:31,116;We're digging trenches
150;00:16:28,883;00:16:31,116;all along our flanks.
151;00:16:31,219;00:16:33,452;They won't be able to hit us
151;00:16:31,219;00:16:33,452;the way that Stannis hit you,
152;00:16:33,554;00:16:34,854;in a double envelopment.
153;00:16:38,893;00:16:40,726;A pincer move.
154;00:16:45,666;00:16:48,133;They won't be able to
154;00:16:45,666;00:16:48,133;hit us from the sides.
155;00:16:48,236;00:16:50,135;Good.
156;00:16:52,539;00:16:55,374;It's crucial that we
156;00:16:52,539;00:16:55,374;let them charge at us.
157;00:16:56,777;00:16:59,378;They've got the numbers,
157;00:16:56,777;00:16:59,378;we need the patience.
158;00:17:02,216;00:17:05,217;If we let him buckle our
158;00:17:02,216;00:17:05,217;center, he'll pursue.
159;00:17:06,050;00:17:08,820;Then we'll have him
159;00:17:06,050;00:17:08,820;surrounded on three sides.
160;00:17:08,923;00:17:12,691;Did you really think that cunt
160;00:17:08,923;00:17:12,691;would fight you man-to-man?
161;00:17:14,028;00:17:15,327;No.
162;00:17:15,429;00:17:17,329;But I wanted to make him angry.
163;00:17:19,934;00:17:22,368;I want him coming at us full tilt.
164;00:17:24,205;00:17:26,105;We should all get some sleep.
165;00:17:26,207;00:17:30,042;Rest, Jon Snow. We need
165;00:17:26,207;00:17:30,042;you sharp tomorrow.
166;00:17:40,388;00:17:42,854;So you've met the enemy,
167;00:17:42,957;00:17:46,358;drawn up your battle plans.
168;00:17:46,460;00:17:49,395;Aye, for what they're worth.
169;00:17:49,496;00:17:53,365;You've known him for the space
169;00:17:49,496;00:17:53,365;of a single conversation,
170;00:17:53,467;00:17:55,267;you and your trusted advisors,
171;00:17:55,369;00:17:56,936;and you sit around making your plans
172;00:17:57,038;00:17:59,905;on how to defeat a man you don't know.
173;00:18:00,007;00:18:01,540;I lived with him.
174;00:18:01,642;00:18:03,242;I know the way his mind works.
175;00:18:03,344;00:18:06,445;I know how he likes to hurt people.
176;00:18:06,547;00:18:10,782;Did it ever once occur to you
176;00:18:06,547;00:18:10,782;that I might have some insight?
177;00:18:13,120;00:18:14,886;You're right.
178;00:18:15,818;00:18:17,656;You think he's going to
178;00:18:15,818;00:18:17,656;fall into your trap.
179;00:18:17,758;00:18:20,025;He won't. He's the one who lays traps.
180;00:18:20,127;00:18:22,928;He's overconfident.
180;00:18:20,127;00:18:22,928;He plays with people.
181;00:18:23,030;00:18:25,664;He's far better at it than you.
181;00:18:23,030;00:18:25,664;He's been doing it all his life.
182;00:18:25,766;00:18:28,567;Aye, and what have I been doing all
182;00:18:25,766;00:18:28,567;my life? Playing with broomsticks?
183;00:18:28,669;00:18:32,471;I fought beyond the Wall against
183;00:18:28,669;00:18:32,471;worse than Ramsay Bolton.
184;00:18:32,573;00:18:35,341;I've defended the Wall from
184;00:18:32,573;00:18:35,341;worse than Ramsay Bolton.
185;00:18:35,443;00:18:37,977;You don't know him.
186;00:18:39,246;00:18:41,213;All right, tell me.
187;00:18:41,315;00:18:44,149;What should we do? How
187;00:18:41,315;00:18:44,149;do we get Rickon back?
188;00:18:46,087;00:18:47,853;We'll never get him back.
189;00:18:49,390;00:18:52,291;Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son,
190;00:18:52,393;00:18:54,093;which makes him a greater
190;00:18:52,393;00:18:54,093;threat to Ramsay
191;00:18:54,195;00:18:57,262;than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.
192;00:18:57,365;00:19:00,332;As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim
192;00:18:57,365;00:19:00,332;to Winterfell will be contested,
193;00:19:00,434;00:19:03,902;which means he won't live long.
194;00:19:04,005;00:19:06,372;We can't give up on our brother.
195;00:19:06,474;00:19:09,574;Listen to me, please. He
195;00:19:06,474;00:19:09,574;wants you to make a mistake.
196;00:19:09,676;00:19:12,711;Of course he does. What
196;00:19:09,676;00:19:12,711;should I do differently?
197;00:19:12,813;00:19:14,913;I don't know! I don't know
197;00:19:12,813;00:19:14,913;anything about battles.
198;00:19:15,016;00:19:18,384;Just don't do what he wants you to do.
199;00:19:18,486;00:19:19,718;Aye, that's good advice.
200;00:19:19,820;00:19:21,186;You think that's obvious?
201;00:19:21,288;00:19:22,654;Well, it is a bit obvious.
202;00:19:22,756;00:19:24,023;If you had asked for my advice earlier,
203;00:19:24,125;00:19:25,790;I would have told you not
203;00:19:24,125;00:19:25,790;to attack Winterfell
204;00:19:25,893;00:19:28,193;until we had a larger force,
204;00:19:25,893;00:19:28,193;or is that obvious, too?
205;00:19:28,295;00:19:30,595;When will we have a larger force?!
206;00:19:30,697;00:19:32,731;We've pleaded with every
206;00:19:30,697;00:19:32,731;house that'll have us.
207;00:19:32,833;00:19:34,099;The Blackfish can't help us.
208;00:19:34,201;00:19:36,135;We're lucky to have this many men.
209;00:19:36,237;00:19:39,738;It's not enough! - No, it's
209;00:19:36,237;00:19:39,738;not enough. It's what we have!
210;00:19:44,145;00:19:48,080;Battles have been won
210;00:19:44,145;00:19:48,080;against greater odds.
211;00:19:54,455;00:19:56,321;If Ramsay wins,
212;00:19:56,424;00:19:58,323;I'm not going back there alive.
213;00:19:58,426;00:20:00,092;Do you understand me?
214;00:20:02,596;00:20:06,598;I won't let ever let
214;00:20:02,596;00:20:06,598;him touch you again.
215;00:20:09,503;00:20:11,603;I'll protect you, I promise.
216;00:20:12,940;00:20:15,340;No one can protect me.
217;00:20:15,443;00:20:17,342;No one can protect anyone.
218;00:20:36,063;00:20:38,097;You think there's hope?
219;00:20:38,199;00:20:40,532;I've never seen these
219;00:20:38,199;00:20:40,532;Bolton fuckers fight.
220;00:20:40,634;00:20:42,968;And they've never seen
220;00:20:40,634;00:20:42,968;the free folk fight,
221;00:20:43,070;00:20:45,070;so, yes, there's hope.
222;00:20:47,241;00:20:50,775;You want to avenge your king, don't you?
223;00:20:50,877;00:20:53,712;It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis.
224;00:20:53,814;00:20:56,281;It was Stannis himself.
225;00:20:56,383;00:20:58,049;I loved the man.
226;00:20:58,152;00:21:00,552;He lifted me up and made me something.
227;00:21:00,654;00:21:03,788;But he had demons in his skull
227;00:21:00,654;00:21:03,788;whispering foul things.
228;00:21:03,890;00:21:06,492;You saw these demons?
228;00:21:03,890;00:21:06,492;What?
229;00:21:07,694;00:21:09,961;No, it's a manner of speaking.
230;00:21:11,501;00:21:14,766;Not... actual demons.
231;00:21:16,303;00:21:19,238;Well, you loved that cunt Stannis
232;00:21:19,340;00:21:21,473;and I loved the man he burned.
233;00:21:21,575;00:21:23,609;Mance didn't have demons in his skull.
234;00:21:23,710;00:21:27,212;He didn't torch people or
234;00:21:23,710;00:21:27,212;listen to some red witch.
235;00:21:27,314;00:21:29,681;I believed in him.
236;00:21:29,783;00:21:33,718;I thought he was the man to
236;00:21:29,783;00:21:33,718;lead us through the Long Night.
237;00:21:33,820;00:21:36,087;But I was wrong just like you.
238;00:21:38,025;00:21:41,160;Maybe that was our mistake,
238;00:21:38,025;00:21:41,160;believing in kings.
239;00:21:42,863;00:21:45,297;Jon Snow's not a king.
240;00:21:47,067;00:21:48,833;No, he's not.
241;00:21:51,905;00:21:55,974;I need a good drink to help me
241;00:21:51,905;00:21:55,974;sleep the night before a fight.
242;00:21:56,076;00:21:57,543;You want some?
243;00:21:57,645;00:22:00,045;I have a jug of sour goat's milk
244;00:22:00,147;00:22:02,080;stronger than any of that grape water
245;00:22:02,183;00:22:04,349;you southern twats like sucking on.
246;00:22:04,451;00:22:06,285;No, thanks. It does sound delicious,
247;00:22:06,387;00:22:08,987;but I better keep a clear head.
248;00:22:09,089;00:22:11,423;I can never sleep the
248;00:22:09,089;00:22:11,423;night before a battle.
249;00:22:11,525;00:22:13,192;So what do you do all night?
250;00:22:13,294;00:22:15,494;I walk.
251;00:22:15,596;00:22:17,329;Think and walk.
252;00:22:17,431;00:22:19,565;Think and walk until I'm
252;00:22:17,431;00:22:19,565;far enough away from camp
253;00:22:19,667;00:22:21,766;that no one can hear me
253;00:22:19,667;00:22:21,766;shitting my guts out.
254;00:22:23,904;00:22:25,837;Happy shitting.
255;00:22:39,119;00:22:40,185;My lady.
256;00:22:44,692;00:22:47,092;You weren't at the war council.
257;00:22:48,596;00:22:50,529;I'm not a soldier.
258;00:22:51,632;00:22:53,965;Any advice?
259;00:22:54,067;00:22:56,368;Don't lose.
260;00:23:02,175;00:23:04,243;If I do, if I fall...
261;00:23:06,747;00:23:09,281;don't bring me back.
262;00:23:10,094;00:23:11,316;I'll have to try.
263;00:23:11,418;00:23:13,518;I'm ordering you not to bring me back.
264;00:23:13,621;00:23:15,287;I am not your servant, Jon Snow.
265;00:23:15,389;00:23:17,656;You're in my camp. I'm the commander.
266;00:23:17,758;00:23:20,425;I serve the Lord of Light.
267;00:23:20,527;00:23:22,794;I do what he commands.
268;00:23:22,896;00:23:24,296;How do you know what he commands?
269;00:23:25,799;00:23:29,033;I interpret his signs...
270;00:23:29,136;00:23:31,303;as well as I can.
271;00:23:33,874;00:23:36,207;If the Lord didn't want
271;00:23:33,874;00:23:36,207;me to bring you back,
272;00:23:36,310;00:23:38,877;how did I bring you back?
273;00:23:38,979;00:23:41,513;I have no power.
274;00:23:41,615;00:23:44,983;Only what he gives me
274;00:23:41,615;00:23:44,983;and he gave me you.
275;00:23:46,353;00:23:48,620;Why?
276;00:23:48,722;00:23:50,889;I don't know.
277;00:23:55,496;00:23:59,998;Maybe you're only needed for this small
277;00:23:55,496;00:23:59,998;part of his plan and nothing else.
278;00:24:00,100;00:24:03,101;Maybe he brought you here to die again.
279;00:24:07,341;00:24:10,342;What kind of god would
279;00:24:07,341;00:24:10,342;do something like that?
280;00:24:12,741;00:24:14,413;The one we've got.
281;00:26:04,224;00:26:07,426;Last time we saw each other
281;00:26:04,224;00:26:07,426;was at Winterfell, yes?
282;00:26:10,464;00:26:13,765;You were making jokes about
282;00:26:10,464;00:26:13,765;my height, I seem to recall.
283;00:26:16,069;00:26:18,102;Everyone who makes a joke
283;00:26:16,069;00:26:18,102;about a dwarf's height
284;00:26:18,204;00:26:22,040;thinks he's the only person ever to
284;00:26:18,204;00:26:22,040;make a joke about a dwarf's height.
285;00:26:22,142;00:26:25,444;The height of nobility,
285;00:26:22,142;00:26:25,444;a man of your stature,
286;00:26:25,546;00:26:27,378;someone to look up to.
287;00:26:28,949;00:26:30,782;You're all making the
287;00:26:28,949;00:26:30,782;same five or six jokes.
288;00:26:30,884;00:26:34,152;It was a long time ago.
288;00:26:30,884;00:26:34,152;It was.
289;00:26:34,254;00:26:37,522;And how have things been
289;00:26:34,254;00:26:37,522;going for you since then?
290;00:26:37,624;00:26:40,425;Not so well, I gather.
291;00:26:40,527;00:26:44,464;Can't imagine you would have murdered the
291;00:26:40,527;00:26:44,464;Stark boys if things had been going well.
292;00:26:44,465;00:26:46,064;I didn't murder the Stark boys.
293;00:26:46,166;00:26:49,033;But I did things that were
293;00:26:46,166;00:26:49,033;just as bad or worse.
294;00:26:49,135;00:26:50,335;And he paid for them.
295;00:26:50,437;00:26:52,403;Doesn't seem like it.
296;00:26:52,506;00:26:54,339;He's still alive.
297;00:26:54,441;00:26:56,407;It was complicated for you, I'm sure,
298;00:26:56,510;00:26:58,677;growing up at Winterfell.
299;00:26:58,779;00:27:01,947;Never quite knowing who you were.
300;00:27:02,048;00:27:05,617;But then, we all live
300;00:27:02,048;00:27:05,617;complicated lives, don't we?
301;00:27:05,719;00:27:07,652;You've brought us 100
301;00:27:05,719;00:27:07,652;ships from the Iron Fleet
302;00:27:07,754;00:27:09,387;with men to sail them.
303;00:27:09,490;00:27:11,690;In return, I expect you
303;00:27:09,490;00:27:11,690;want me to support
304;00:27:11,792;00:27:14,225;your claim to the throne
304;00:27:11,792;00:27:14,225;of the Iron Islands?
305;00:27:14,327;00:27:17,017;Not my claim. Hers.
306;00:27:17,018;00:27:18,329;And what's wrong with you?
307;00:27:18,431;00:27:19,931;I'm not fit to rule.
308;00:27:20,033;00:27:21,600;We can agree upon that at least.
309;00:27:21,702;00:27:24,302;Has the Iron Islands
309;00:27:21,702;00:27:24,302;ever had a queen before?
310;00:27:24,404;00:27:25,971;No more than Westeros.
311;00:27:27,741;00:27:31,109;Our Uncle Euron returned
311;00:27:27,741;00:27:31,109;home after a long absence.
312;00:27:31,211;00:27:34,679;He murdered our father and took
312;00:27:31,211;00:27:34,679;the Salt Throne from Yara.
313;00:27:34,781;00:27:37,348;He would have murdered
313;00:27:34,781;00:27:37,348;us if we'd stayed.
314;00:27:38,819;00:27:41,887;Lord Tyrion tells me your
314;00:27:38,819;00:27:41,887;father was a terrible king.
315;00:27:41,989;00:27:44,122;You and I have that in common.
316;00:27:45,726;00:27:46,892;We do.
317;00:27:46,994;00:27:49,327;And both murdered by a usurper as well.
318;00:27:50,664;00:27:52,230;Will their ships be enough?
319;00:27:52,332;00:27:55,400;With the former Masters'
319;00:27:52,332;00:27:55,400;fleet, possibly.
320;00:27:55,502;00:27:57,536;Barely.
321;00:27:57,638;00:28:00,304;There are more than 100
321;00:27:57,638;00:28:00,304;ships in the Iron Fleet.
322;00:28:00,407;00:28:02,807;There are and Euron is building more.
323;00:28:02,910;00:28:04,543;He's going to offer them to you.
324;00:28:04,645;00:28:06,077;So why shouldn't I wait for him?
325;00:28:06,179;00:28:08,713;The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing.
326;00:28:08,815;00:28:10,916;He also wants to give you...
327;00:28:11,018;00:28:14,653;His big cock, I think he said.
328;00:28:14,755;00:28:17,989;Euron's offer is also an
328;00:28:14,755;00:28:17,989;offer of marriage, you see.
329;00:28:18,091;00:28:19,891;You won't get one without the other.
330;00:28:19,993;00:28:22,493;And I imagine your offer is
330;00:28:19,993;00:28:22,493;free of any marriage demands?
331;00:28:22,596;00:28:25,897;I never demand, but I'm
331;00:28:22,596;00:28:25,897;up for anything, really.
332;00:28:27,734;00:28:30,401;He murdered our father and
332;00:28:27,734;00:28:30,401;would have murdered us.
333;00:28:30,503;00:28:33,071;He'll murder you as soon
333;00:28:30,503;00:28:33,071;as you have what he wants.
334;00:28:33,173;00:28:34,839;The Seven Kingdoms.
335;00:28:34,942;00:28:36,107;All of them.
336;00:28:36,209;00:28:37,909;And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?
337;00:28:38,011;00:28:41,279;Your ancestors defeated ours
337;00:28:38,011;00:28:41,279;and took the Iron Islands.
338;00:28:41,381;00:28:43,848;We ask you to give them back.
339;00:28:43,951;00:28:45,216;And that's all?
340;00:28:45,318;00:28:47,886;We'd like you to help us
340;00:28:45,318;00:28:47,886;murder an uncle or two
341;00:28:47,988;00:28:49,854;who don't think a woman's fit to rule.
342;00:28:49,957;00:28:51,590;Reasonable.
343;00:28:53,894;00:28:56,494;What if everyone starts
343;00:28:53,894;00:28:56,494;demanding their independence?
344;00:28:56,597;00:28:58,597;She's not demanding, she's asking.
345;00:28:58,699;00:29:01,466;The others are free to ask as well.
346;00:29:05,271;00:29:08,707;Our fathers were evil
346;00:29:05,271;00:29:08,707;men, all of us here.
347;00:29:08,809;00:29:11,242;They left the world worse
347;00:29:08,809;00:29:11,242;than they found it.
348;00:29:11,344;00:29:12,944;We're not going to do that.
349;00:29:13,046;00:29:16,047;We're going to leave the world
349;00:29:13,046;00:29:16,047;better than we found it.
350;00:29:18,085;00:29:21,586;You will support my claim as
350;00:29:18,085;00:29:21,586;queen of the Seven Kingdoms
351;00:29:21,688;00:29:24,990;and respect the integrity
351;00:29:21,688;00:29:24,990;of the Seven Kingdoms.
352;00:29:25,092;00:29:29,628;No more reaving, roving,
352;00:29:25,092;00:29:29,628;raiding, or raping.
353;00:29:30,964;00:29:32,430;That's our way of life.
354;00:29:32,532;00:29:34,065;No more.
355;00:29:41,642;00:29:43,341;No more.
356;00:33:27,901;00:33:30,501;Do you like games, little man?
357;00:33:30,603;00:33:32,670;Let's play a game.
358;00:33:36,309;00:33:38,009;Run to your brother.
359;00:33:38,111;00:33:39,944;The sooner you make it to him,
360;00:33:40,046;00:33:42,413;the sooner you get to see him again.
361;00:33:45,085;00:33:46,550;That's it.
362;00:33:46,652;00:33:48,786;That's the game.
363;00:33:48,889;00:33:50,788;Easy.
364;00:33:50,891;00:33:52,790;Ready?
365;00:33:53,260;00:33:54,358;Go.
366;00:33:58,164;00:34:01,132;No, you have to run, remember?
367;00:34:01,234;00:34:03,368;Those are the rules.

409;00:45:26,285;00:45:28,318;We're going home!
410;00:49:44,643;00:49:46,810;Open the gate!
411;00:49:51,650;00:49:54,017;Archers to the wall.

412;00:49:55,988;00:49:58,255;Our army's gone.
413;00:49:59,624;00:50:01,458;We have Winterfell.
414;00:50:01,560;00:50:03,994;They don't have the men for a siege.
414;00:50:01,560;00:50:03,994;All we have to do is wait.
415;00:50:04,648;00:50:05,896;Archers!
416;00:50:05,998;00:50:07,697;To the wall!
417;00:51:41,860;00:51:44,761;You suggested one-on-one
417;00:51:41,860;00:51:44,761;combat, didn't you?
418;00:51:52,504;00:51:54,972;I've reconsidered.
419;00:51:55,074;00:51:58,541;I think that sounds
419;00:51:55,074;00:51:58,541;like a wonderful idea.
420;00:53:58,464;00:54:01,064;We're going to bury my
420;00:53:58,464;00:54:01,064;brother in the crypt
421;00:54:01,166;00:54:03,266;next to my father.
422;00:54:09,508;00:54:10,673;Jon.

424;00:54:48,413;00:54:49,979;Sansa.
425;00:54:53,452;00:54:55,652;Hello, Sansa.
426;00:55:03,028;00:55:05,662;Is this where I'll be staying now?
427;00:55:14,039;00:55:16,072;No.
428;00:55:19,878;00:55:23,647;Our time together is
428;00:55:19,878;00:55:23,647;about to come to an end.
429;00:55:26,585;00:55:28,985;That's all right.
430;00:55:29,087;00:55:30,920;You can't kill me.
431;00:55:32,558;00:55:34,691;I'm part of you now.
432;00:55:37,496;00:55:39,762;Your words will disappear.
433;00:55:42,467;00:55:45,235;Your house will disappear.
434;00:55:45,957;00:55:48,505;Your name will disappear.
435;00:55:50,475;00:55:53,076;All memory of you will disappear.

437;00:56:22,907;00:56:25,342;You haven't fed them in seven days.
438;00:56:25,444;00:56:26,909;You said it yourself.
439;00:56:31,149;00:56:32,749;They're loyal beasts.
440;00:56:32,851;00:56:34,684;They were.
441;00:56:34,786;00:56:36,653;Now they're starving.
442;00:57:00,679;00:57:02,545;Sit.
443;00:57:02,648;00:57:04,080;Down.
444;00:57:04,182;00:57:06,783;Down!
445;00:57:07,886;00:57:10,052;Down! Down!
446;00:57:10,155;00:57:12,088;Down!
