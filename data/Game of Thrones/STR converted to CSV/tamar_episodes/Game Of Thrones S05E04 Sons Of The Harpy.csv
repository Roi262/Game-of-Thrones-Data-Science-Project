2;00:03:11,576;00:03:13,861;Is that Estermont?
3;00:03:13,945;00:03:16,313;Tarth, Ser Jaime.
4;00:03:18,104;00:03:20,484;The Sapphire Isle.
5;00:03:24,236;00:03:26,103;Why are we on a merchant ship?
6;00:03:26,154;00:03:27,938;Why no Lannister sails?
7;00:03:30,609;00:03:32,576;This ship's sailing to Oldtown.
8;00:03:32,611;00:03:35,246;We'll get off earlier
8;00:03:32,611;00:03:35,246;not far from Sunspear,
9;00:03:35,280;00:03:37,748;row ourselves to the Dornish
9;00:03:35,280;00:03:37,748;shore in the night.
10;00:03:39,117;00:03:40,784;You ever been to Dorne?
11;00:03:40,786;00:03:42,753;No.
11;00:03:40,786;00:03:42,753;I have.
12;00:03:42,787;00:03:44,505;The Dornish are crazy.
13;00:03:44,539;00:03:47,591;All they want to do is fight
13;00:03:44,539;00:03:47,591;and fuck, fuck and fight.
14;00:03:47,626;00:03:49,593;You should be happy to go back.
15;00:03:50,845;00:03:52,463;There's nothing
15;00:03:50,845;00:03:52,463;like a good fight
16;00:03:52,514;00:03:54,798;to get you in the mood
16;00:03:52,514;00:03:54,798;for fucking.
17;00:03:54,849;00:03:57,101;And there's nothing like
17;00:03:54,849;00:03:57,101;a fuck-mad Dornish girl
18;00:03:57,135;00:03:59,303;to clear your head
18;00:03:57,135;00:03:59,303;for the next fight.
19;00:03:59,305;00:04:01,522;It's how the two work together.
20;00:04:01,556;00:04:03,724;Now we're gonna be doing
20;00:04:01,556;00:04:03,724;a lot of fighting, I'm sure.
21;00:04:03,808;00:04:05,309;Well, I am.
22;00:04:05,360;00:04:08,112;But I don't imagine we'll get
22;00:04:05,360;00:04:08,112;to stick around for the rest.
23;00:04:08,146;00:04:10,147;Not after we've kidnapped
23;00:04:08,146;00:04:10,147;their princess.
24;00:04:10,198;00:04:12,199;We're not kidnapping
24;00:04:10,198;00:04:12,199;their princess.
25;00:04:12,233;00:04:15,319;We're rescuing my niece,
25;00:04:12,233;00:04:15,319;bringing her back to her family.
26;00:04:15,321;00:04:16,620;Your niece?
27;00:04:24,746;00:04:27,081;I've been doing this sort
27;00:04:24,746;00:04:27,081;of thing a long time.
28;00:04:27,132;00:04:29,133;I'm good at it.
28;00:04:27,132;00:04:29,133;That's why you're here.
29;00:04:29,167;00:04:31,418;I know.
29;00:04:29,167;00:04:31,418;Why are you here?
30;00:04:31,469;00:04:33,671;Why not send 40 of me?
30;00:04:31,469;00:04:33,671;Or an army?
31;00:04:33,722;00:04:36,223;Unlike most folks,
31;00:04:33,722;00:04:36,223;you've actually got one.
32;00:04:36,308;00:04:39,093;Because I don't want
32;00:04:36,308;00:04:39,093;to start a war.
33;00:04:39,144;00:04:42,479;That still doesn't explain
33;00:04:39,144;00:04:42,479;what you're doing here.
34;00:04:45,350;00:04:46,650;It has to be me.
35;00:04:49,654;00:04:52,573;If I'm putting something
35;00:04:49,654;00:04:52,573;like this together,
36;00:04:52,607;00:04:54,608;a one-handed man
36;00:04:52,607;00:04:54,608;who happens to be
37;00:04:54,659;00:04:57,361;one of the most recognizable
37;00:04:54,659;00:04:57,361;faces in Westeros is not--
38;00:04:57,363;00:04:59,246;It has to be me.
39;00:05:04,336;00:05:06,537;You set your brother
39;00:05:04,336;00:05:06,537;free, didn't you?
40;00:05:08,840;00:05:11,041;I'll bet your sister
40;00:05:08,840;00:05:11,041;didn't like that.
41;00:05:12,293;00:05:14,678;Varys set him free.
42;00:05:18,683;00:05:23,637;Well, if you ever see
42;00:05:18,683;00:05:23,637;the wee fucker,
43;00:05:23,688;00:05:25,305;give him my regards.
44;00:05:29,277;00:05:31,395;He murdered my father.
45;00:05:34,065;00:05:37,117;If I ever see him,
45;00:05:34,065;00:05:37,117;I'll split him in two.
46;00:05:38,236;00:05:40,571;And then I'll give
46;00:05:38,236;00:05:40,571;him your regards.
47;00:05:46,428;00:05:51,415;The Iron Bank has called in
47;00:05:46,428;00:05:51,415;one-tenth of the crown's debts.
48;00:05:51,417;00:05:54,218;Given the expense of
48;00:05:51,417;00:05:54,218;rebuilding the royal fleet--
49;00:05:54,252;00:05:55,552;How much can the crown afford?
50;00:05:55,587;00:05:57,154;With winter coming,
51;00:05:57,188;00:06:00,591;half what they ask, less?
52;00:06:00,625;00:06:03,894;You're the Master of Coin.
52;00:06:00,625;00:06:03,894;How do we pay them?
53;00:06:03,928;00:06:05,929;House Tyrell could
53;00:06:03,928;00:06:05,929;front the gold
54;00:06:05,980;00:06:08,065;and the crown would
54;00:06:05,980;00:06:08,065;pay us back in time
55;00:06:08,099;00:06:10,768;or I'd have words
55;00:06:08,099;00:06:10,768;with my daughter.
56;00:06:15,940;00:06:18,609;You've already
56;00:06:15,940;00:06:18,609;given us too much.
57;00:06:18,660;00:06:22,613;No, we must arrange better
57;00:06:18,660;00:06:22,613;terms with the Iron Bank.
58;00:06:22,615;00:06:25,282;Absolutely.
58;00:06:22,615;00:06:25,282;In person.
59;00:06:26,918;00:06:29,953;Me? - We must send an envoy
59;00:06:26,918;00:06:29,953;to the Iron Bank,
60;00:06:29,988;00:06:33,624;someone of importance to show
60;00:06:29,988;00:06:33,624;these bankers our respect.
61;00:06:33,626;00:06:36,627;As the king's Master of Coin, I can
61;00:06:33,626;00:06:36,627;think of no one more qualified.
62;00:06:36,678;00:06:38,762;I would be honored, Your Grace.
63;00:06:38,797;00:06:42,716;The king's expressed concern about his
63;00:06:38,797;00:06:42,716;father-in-law's safety on this voyage.
64;00:06:46,020;00:06:50,307;He's ordered Ser Meryn to
64;00:06:46,020;00:06:50,307;personally lead your escort.
65;00:06:51,976;00:06:54,061;My very own Kingsguard?
66;00:06:54,145;00:06:56,146;Please express my--
66;00:06:54,145;00:06:56,146;Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.
67;00:06:56,197;00:06:58,148;Of course.
67;00:06:56,197;00:06:58,148;Of course.
68;00:06:58,150;00:07:02,069;I'll give your regards
68;00:06:58,150;00:07:02,069;to the Titan of Braavos.
69;00:07:10,879;00:07:14,214;The small council grows
69;00:07:10,879;00:07:14,214;smaller and smaller.
70;00:07:14,299;00:07:16,583;Not small enough.
71;00:07:26,761;00:07:29,847;May I offer you
71;00:07:26,761;00:07:29,847;some wine, Your Holiness?
72;00:07:29,849;00:07:31,815;No.
73;00:07:35,069;00:07:37,855;The old High Septon would
73;00:07:35,069;00:07:37,855;have asked the vintage.
74;00:07:37,906;00:07:40,941;I could say that our minds
74;00:07:37,906;00:07:40,941;are temples to the Seven
75;00:07:40,992;00:07:43,527;and should be kept pure.
76;00:07:43,529;00:07:46,747;But the truth is
76;00:07:43,529;00:07:46,747;I don't like the taste.
77;00:07:46,831;00:07:48,916;Hmm.
78;00:07:48,950;00:07:51,368;How may I serve?
79;00:07:52,754;00:07:56,206;All over Westeros we hear
79;00:07:52,754;00:07:56,206;of septs being burned,

81;00:07:59,427;00:08:02,045;piled in the streets.
82;00:08:02,047;00:08:05,599;Wars teach people to obey
82;00:08:02,047;00:08:05,599;the sword, not the gods.
83;00:08:05,633;00:08:08,602;Perhaps the gods
83;00:08:05,633;00:08:08,602;need a sword of their own.
84;00:08:08,636;00:08:10,621;In the days before
84;00:08:08,636;00:08:10,621;the Targaryens,
85;00:08:10,655;00:08:14,057;the Faith Militant dispensed
85;00:08:10,655;00:08:14,057;the justice of the Seven.
86;00:08:14,092;00:08:18,579;Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed
86;00:08:14,092;00:08:18,579;more than two centuries ago.
87;00:08:18,613;00:08:22,149;If I explain their holy
87;00:08:18,613;00:08:22,149;purpose to my son the king,
88;00:08:22,183;00:08:24,318;I have no doubt
88;00:08:22,183;00:08:24,318;he will sign a decree
89;00:08:24,369;00:08:26,486;arming the believers
89;00:08:24,369;00:08:26,486;you felt worthy.
90;00:08:26,538;00:08:31,108;An army that defends the bodies
90;00:08:26,538;00:08:31,108;and souls of the common people?
91;00:08:31,142;00:08:34,077;An army in service
91;00:08:31,142;00:08:34,077;to the gods themselves.
92;00:08:34,128;00:08:36,079;And to you, of course,
93;00:08:36,130;00:08:38,465;as the chosen representative
93;00:08:36,130;00:08:38,465;of the Seven.
94;00:08:38,550;00:08:41,084;An honor I never expected.
95;00:08:41,169;00:08:42,970;Or, indeed, ever wished for.
96;00:08:43,004;00:08:45,004;Which is why you were chosen.
97;00:08:46,724;00:08:49,176;You and I both know
97;00:08:46,724;00:08:49,176;how the world works.
98;00:08:49,227;00:08:51,411;Too often the wicked
98;00:08:49,227;00:08:51,411;are the wealthiest,
99;00:08:51,446;00:08:53,247;beyond the reach of justice.
100;00:08:53,281;00:08:57,017;The king himself cannot always
100;00:08:53,281;00:08:57,017;punish those who deserve it most.

102;00:09:04,192;00:09:08,862;a great sinner in our very midst?
103;00:09:08,947;00:09:11,848;Shielded by gold and privilege.
104;00:09:13,818;00:09:16,453;May the Father judge him justly.
105;00:09:48,319;00:09:51,405;What are you doing?
106;00:09:54,909;00:09:57,294;Help me!
106;00:09:54,909;00:09:57,294;Help me!
107;00:10:03,668;00:10:06,503;Yeah. Yeah.

125;00:11:47,238;00:11:49,072;Justice.
126;00:11:55,329;00:11:57,831;Why is my brother in a cell?

132;00:12:10,962;00:12:13,430;She's jealous
132;00:12:10,962;00:12:13,430;you're not hers anymore.
133;00:12:13,464;00:12:16,299;Arresting my brother
133;00:12:13,464;00:12:16,299;is her revenge.
134;00:12:16,384;00:12:18,468;Aren't you and Mother
134;00:12:16,384;00:12:18,468;getting along?
135;00:12:24,142;00:12:27,944;Oh, my sweet, sweet king.
136;00:12:29,447;00:12:33,007;Do you have any affection
136;00:12:29,447;00:12:33,007;for me at all?
137;00:12:34,202;00:12:36,286;Of course I do.
138;00:12:36,320;00:12:38,155;You're my queen.
139;00:12:38,239;00:12:40,574;I can't bear
139;00:12:38,239;00:12:40,574;to think of my brother
140;00:12:40,625;00:12:43,376;locked away in some grimy cell.
141;00:12:45,329;00:12:47,798;I'll set him free for you.
142;00:12:47,832;00:12:49,382;Do you promise?
143;00:12:56,174;00:12:58,809;I demand that
143;00:12:56,174;00:12:58,809;Ser Loras be freed now.
144;00:12:58,843;00:13:00,727;Did I arrest him?
145;00:13:02,096;00:13:04,514;Well, no.
146;00:13:04,516;00:13:06,900;But y-you armed
146;00:13:04,516;00:13:06,900;the Faith Militant.
147;00:13:06,934;00:13:10,487;You gave the High Sparrow
147;00:13:06,934;00:13:10,487;an army.
148;00:13:10,521;00:13:12,772;I did.
149;00:13:12,824;00:13:16,860;And your wife has
149;00:13:12,824;00:13:16,860;every right to criticize.
150;00:13:16,911;00:13:19,613;We can't allow fanatics
150;00:13:16,911;00:13:19,613;to arrest the queen's brother
151;00:13:19,664;00:13:22,249;no matter his perversions.
152;00:13:22,283;00:13:24,117;Then...
153;00:13:25,703;00:13:28,205;can I tell Margaery you'll
153;00:13:25,703;00:13:28,205;have Ser Loras released?
154;00:13:28,256;00:13:30,924;I told you,
154;00:13:28,256;00:13:30,924;I'm not holding Ser Loras.
155;00:13:31,008;00:13:32,926;You're the king.
156;00:13:32,960;00:13:34,711;I'm sure if you speak
156;00:13:32,960;00:13:34,711;to the High Sparrow,
157;00:13:34,762;00:13:37,264;he'll release the poor boy.
158;00:13:42,019;00:13:44,054;Halt!
159;00:14:06,544;00:14:09,996;His Holiness is praying.
159;00:14:06,544;00:14:09,996;He will not be disturbed.
160;00:14:11,582;00:14:14,885;Give the order and we'll
160;00:14:11,582;00:14:14,885;clear out this rabble.
161;00:14:16,304;00:14:19,139;You mean, kill them?
162;00:14:19,173;00:14:20,974;Here at the sept?
163;00:14:21,008;00:14:24,169;You'd be sending them to meet
163;00:14:21,008;00:14:24,169;the gods that they love.
164;00:14:27,398;00:14:29,266;Bastard!
165;00:14:29,268;00:14:31,484;You're an abomination!
166;00:14:36,440;00:14:38,775;Born of sin!
167;00:14:38,826;00:14:41,077;Filthy bastard!
168;00:14:45,783;00:14:48,001;We'll find another way.
169;00:14:50,121;00:14:51,788;Abomination!
170;00:14:57,378;00:14:59,462;My queen?
171;00:15:04,468;00:15:06,970;There was no way to free Ser
171;00:15:04,468;00:15:06,970;Loras without violence.
172;00:15:10,224;00:15:12,642;You're the King of the Andals,
173;00:15:12,693;00:15:14,361;the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
174;00:15:14,395;00:15:16,613;the Protector of the Realm,
175;00:15:16,647;00:15:19,983;and you let a band of fanatics
175;00:15:16,647;00:15:19,983;imprison your brother by law.
176;00:15:21,485;00:15:22,986;I'm going to speak
176;00:15:21,485;00:15:22,986;with the High Sparrow.
177;00:15:23,037;00:15:25,071;Are you?
177;00:15:23,037;00:15:25,071;When?
178;00:15:26,490;00:15:29,042;I-I don't know.
178;00:15:26,490;00:15:29,042;You don't know?
179;00:15:29,076;00:15:31,628;He was praying just now.
180;00:15:34,548;00:15:36,549;I have to send word
180;00:15:34,548;00:15:36,549;to Grandmother.
181;00:15:37,668;00:15:39,886;Will you come back later?
182;00:15:41,505;00:15:44,224;I need to be with
182;00:15:41,505;00:15:44,224;my family, Your Grace.
183;00:15:45,476;00:15:47,310;Of course.
184;00:15:50,181;00:15:51,848;You think
184;00:15:50,181;00:15:51,848;highly of this boy?
185;00:15:51,899;00:15:53,400;Good.
186;00:15:53,434;00:15:55,402;Lord Commander
186;00:15:53,434;00:15:55,402;of the Night's Watch.
187;00:15:55,436;00:15:58,188;And a bastard
187;00:15:55,436;00:15:58,188;by some tavern slut.
188;00:15:58,190;00:16:01,550;Perhaps, but that
188;00:15:58,190;00:16:01,550;wasn't Ned Stark's way.
189;00:16:04,829;00:16:07,030;I should have given you a son.
190;00:16:08,749;00:16:10,367;Not your fault.
191;00:16:10,369;00:16:12,335;Whose, then?
192;00:16:12,370;00:16:14,871;I gave you nothing but weakness.
193;00:16:17,708;00:16:19,292;And deformity.
194;00:16:20,711;00:16:23,263;Those scars mean nothing
194;00:16:20,711;00:16:23,263;to the Lord of Light.
195;00:16:23,347;00:16:25,265;My lady.
196;00:16:25,299;00:16:28,051;Her father is the Lord's
196;00:16:25,299;00:16:28,051;chosen king,
197;00:16:28,102;00:16:30,804;and her father's blood
197;00:16:28,102;00:16:30,804;runs through her veins.
198;00:16:39,647;00:16:42,115;You march on Winterfell soon?
199;00:16:42,149;00:16:45,535;We must to beat the snows.
200;00:16:46,821;00:16:49,122;Once before, you put
200;00:16:46,821;00:16:49,122;your faith in Ser Davos
201;00:16:49,156;00:16:51,291;and left me behind.
202;00:16:53,627;00:16:55,795;I hope you won't make
202;00:16:53,627;00:16:55,795;that mistake again.
203;00:16:55,830;00:16:57,547;I won't.
204;00:16:59,917;00:17:01,584;I need you.
205;00:17:01,586;00:17:04,254;You only need faith, my king.
206;00:17:08,676;00:17:10,760;And you, my lady,
206;00:17:08,676;00:17:10,760;what do you need?
207;00:17:12,430;00:17:15,315;To serve my Lord.
208;00:17:19,320;00:17:21,654;Lord Ashford.
209;00:17:26,377;00:17:29,129;Lady Caulfield.
210;00:17:30,331;00:17:33,333;Oh, Lord Smallwood.
211;00:17:33,384;00:17:35,218;I've never even heard
211;00:17:33,384;00:17:35,218;of these people.
212;00:17:35,252;00:17:37,804;They haven't heard
212;00:17:35,252;00:17:37,804;of you, either.
213;00:17:37,838;00:17:40,256;But we need men
213;00:17:37,838;00:17:40,256;and they have some.
214;00:17:42,476;00:17:45,395;How many men does this
214;00:17:42,476;00:17:45,395;Lord Mayzen have to send us?
215;00:17:45,429;00:17:47,814;More than Lord Wibberley.
216;00:18:01,112;00:18:03,530;Not him.
216;00:18:01,112;00:18:03,530;I know, I'm sorry.
217;00:18:03,581;00:18:05,915;But we need men and supplies
218;00:18:05,950;00:18:07,450;and Roose Bolton's
218;00:18:05,950;00:18:07,450;the Warden of the North.
219;00:18:07,452;00:18:08,835;He murdered my brother.
220;00:18:08,919;00:18:12,122;We swore to be
220;00:18:08,919;00:18:12,122;the watchers on the Wall.
221;00:18:12,206;00:18:15,625;We can't watch the Wall
221;00:18:12,206;00:18:15,625;with 50 men.
222;00:18:15,676;00:18:17,460;And we can't get more men
223;00:18:17,462;00:18:19,796;without help from
223;00:18:17,462;00:18:19,796;the Warden of the North.
224;00:18:42,653;00:18:44,871;Apologies, my lady.
225;00:18:56,584;00:18:58,451;Lord Commander.
226;00:18:58,486;00:19:00,870;How can I help you?
227;00:19:00,905;00:19:03,173;Come with us when we ride south.
228;00:19:03,175;00:19:06,476;None of us know the
228;00:19:03,175;00:19:06,476;castle as well as you do.
229;00:19:06,510;00:19:08,928;Its hidden tunnels,
229;00:19:06,510;00:19:08,928;its weaknesses,
230;00:19:08,979;00:19:11,614;its people.
231;00:19:11,649;00:19:13,933;Winterfell was your home once.
232;00:19:15,236;00:19:17,937;Don't you want to chase
232;00:19:15,236;00:19:17,937;the rats out of it?
233;00:19:20,357;00:19:22,992;Castle Black is my home now.
234;00:19:23,027;00:19:26,629;The Night's Watch take no part in
234;00:19:23,027;00:19:26,629;the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.
235;00:19:26,664;00:19:28,698;There's only one war.
236;00:19:28,732;00:19:31,000;Life against death.
237;00:19:32,736;00:19:36,172;Come, let me show you
237;00:19:32,736;00:19:36,172;what you're fighting for.
238;00:19:36,207;00:19:38,791;You're gonna show me
238;00:19:36,207;00:19:38,791;some vision in the fire?
239;00:19:38,843;00:19:42,295;Forgive me, my lady,
239;00:19:38,843;00:19:42,295;I don't trust in visions.
240;00:19:43,597;00:19:47,183;No visions.
240;00:19:43,597;00:19:47,183;No magic.
241;00:19:47,218;00:19:49,219;Just life.
242;00:20:08,873;00:20:11,658;Do you feel my heart beating?
243;00:20:13,794;00:20:15,912;There's power in you.
244;00:20:15,963;00:20:18,882;You resist it,
244;00:20:15,963;00:20:18,882;and that's your mistake.
245;00:20:18,916;00:20:20,750;Embrace it.
246;00:20:30,594;00:20:34,597;The Lord of Light
246;00:20:30,594;00:20:34,597;made us male and female.
247;00:20:34,648;00:20:37,267;Two parts of a greater whole.
248;00:20:38,435;00:20:42,021;In our joining, there's power.
249;00:20:42,072;00:20:44,574;Power to make life,
250;00:20:44,608;00:20:46,943;power to make light,
251;00:20:46,994;00:20:49,862;and power to cast shadows.
252;00:20:49,914;00:20:52,949;I don't think Stannis
252;00:20:49,914;00:20:52,949;would like that very much.
253;00:20:54,001;00:20:56,286;Then we shouldn't tell him.
254;00:20:57,288;00:20:59,789;I can't.
254;00:20:57,288;00:20:59,789;Why?
255;00:21:00,708;00:21:03,126;I swore a vow.
256;00:21:04,428;00:21:06,763;I loved another.
257;00:21:06,797;00:21:09,048;The dead don't need lovers.
258;00:21:09,133;00:21:11,351;Only the living.
259;00:21:15,806;00:21:18,641;I know.
260;00:21:18,643;00:21:20,727;But I still love her.
261;00:21:35,376;00:21:37,827;You know nothing, Jon Snow.
262;00:22:15,199;00:22:16,616;Are you lonely?
263;00:22:18,168;00:22:19,669;Just bored.
264;00:22:19,703;00:22:21,337;My father used
264;00:22:19,703;00:22:21,337;to tell me that boredom
265;00:22:21,372;00:22:23,006;indicates a lack
265;00:22:21,372;00:22:23,006;of inner resources.
266;00:22:23,040;00:22:24,674;Were you bored a lot, too?
267;00:22:24,708;00:22:27,276;I know Castle Black
268;00:22:27,311;00:22:28,711;is no place
268;00:22:27,311;00:22:28,711;for a child, but--
269;00:22:28,713;00:22:32,348;I like it. I thought
269;00:22:28,713;00:22:32,348;I'd be left at home.
270;00:22:32,383;00:22:35,018;I know Mother
270;00:22:32,383;00:22:35,018;didn't want to bring me.
271;00:22:35,052;00:22:37,103;Why do you say that?
272;00:22:38,305;00:22:40,890;She told me, I don't
272;00:22:38,305;00:22:40,890;want to bring you.
273;00:22:42,559;00:22:44,639;She shouldn't have said that.
274;00:22:54,321;00:22:56,489;Are you ashamed of me, Father?
275;00:23:07,751;00:23:10,386;When you were an infant,
276;00:23:10,421;00:23:13,890;a Dornish trader
276;00:23:10,421;00:23:13,890;landed on Dragonstone.
277;00:23:13,924;00:23:17,260;His goods were junk
277;00:23:13,924;00:23:17,260;except for one wooden doll.
278;00:23:19,012;00:23:22,331;He had even sewn a dress on it
278;00:23:19,012;00:23:22,331;in the colors of our house.
279;00:23:23,984;00:23:26,352;No doubt he had
279;00:23:23,984;00:23:26,352;heard of your birth
280;00:23:26,403;00:23:29,605;and assumed new fathers
280;00:23:26,403;00:23:29,605;were easy targets.
281;00:23:33,160;00:23:36,640;I still remember how you smiled when
281;00:23:33,160;00:23:36,640;I put that doll in your cradle.
282;00:23:37,948;00:23:40,366;How you pressed it
282;00:23:37,948;00:23:40,366;to your cheek.
283;00:23:47,291;00:23:50,091;By the time we burned the
283;00:23:47,291;00:23:50,091;doll, it was too late.
284;00:23:52,546;00:23:54,714;I was told you would die.
285;00:23:54,765;00:23:57,767;Or worse,
286;00:23:57,801;00:23:59,635;the greyscale would go slow.
287;00:23:59,686;00:24:02,805;Let you grow just enough
287;00:23:59,686;00:24:02,805;to know the world
288;00:24:02,856;00:24:05,108;before taking it away from you.
289;00:24:05,142;00:24:07,810;Everyone advised me to send
289;00:24:05,142;00:24:07,810;you to the ruins of Valyria
290;00:24:07,812;00:24:09,896;to live out your short life
290;00:24:07,812;00:24:09,896;with the Stone Men
291;00:24:09,947;00:24:12,949;before the sickness
291;00:24:09,947;00:24:12,949;spread through the castle.
292;00:24:14,318;00:24:16,986;I told them all to go to hell.
293;00:24:18,572;00:24:21,457;I called in every maester
293;00:24:18,572;00:24:21,457;on this side of the world.
294;00:24:21,492;00:24:24,660;Every healer.
294;00:24:21,492;00:24:24,660;Every apothecary.
295;00:24:26,747;00:24:28,988;They stopped the disease
295;00:24:26,747;00:24:28,988;and saved your life.
296;00:24:30,167;00:24:31,968;'Cause you did not belong
296;00:24:30,167;00:24:31,968;across the world
297;00:24:32,002;00:24:34,720;with the bloody Stone Men.
298;00:24:34,755;00:24:37,795;You are the Princess Shireen
298;00:24:34,755;00:24:37,795;of House Baratheon.
299;00:24:40,227;00:24:42,094;And you are my daughter.
300;00:25:43,440;00:25:45,775;I thought
300;00:25:43,440;00:25:45,775;I might find you here.
301;00:25:48,328;00:25:50,279;Your Aunt Lyanna.
302;00:25:50,281;00:25:53,249;Father never talked about her.
303;00:25:54,835;00:25:57,837;Sometimes I'd find him down
303;00:25:54,835;00:25:57,837;here lighting the candles.
304;00:25:59,206;00:26:00,840;They say she was beautiful.
305;00:26:00,874;00:26:03,209;I saw her once.
306;00:26:03,260;00:26:06,345;I was a boy living
306;00:26:03,260;00:26:06,345;with your mother's family.
307;00:26:06,380;00:26:10,049;Lord Whent held a great
307;00:26:06,380;00:26:10,049;tourney at Harrenhal.
308;00:26:10,100;00:26:12,134;Everyone was there.
309;00:26:12,185;00:26:15,638;The Mad King, your father,
310;00:26:15,722;00:26:17,223;Robert Baratheon,
311;00:26:17,274;00:26:19,141;and Lyanna.
312;00:26:19,143;00:26:22,028;She was already
312;00:26:19,143;00:26:22,028;promised to Robert.
313;00:26:22,062;00:26:23,896;You can imagine
313;00:26:22,062;00:26:23,896;what it was like for me,
314;00:26:23,947;00:26:27,483;a boy from nowhere
314;00:26:23,947;00:26:27,483;with nothing to his name,
315;00:26:27,485;00:26:29,285;watching these legendary men
316;00:26:29,319;00:26:32,204;tilting at the lists.
317;00:26:32,239;00:26:35,124;The last two riders
317;00:26:32,239;00:26:35,124;were Barristan Selmy
318;00:26:35,158;00:26:37,159;and Rhaegar Targaryen.
319;00:26:37,210;00:26:40,997;When Rhaegar won, everyone
319;00:26:37,210;00:26:40,997;cheered for their prince.
320;00:26:41,048;00:26:42,999;I remember the girls laughing
320;00:26:41,048;00:26:42,999;when he took off his helmet
321;00:26:43,001;00:26:45,001;and they saw that silver hair.
322;00:26:45,085;00:26:47,420;How handsome he was.
323;00:26:47,471;00:26:50,256;Until he rode
323;00:26:47,471;00:26:50,256;right past his wife,
324;00:26:50,340;00:26:52,308;Elia Martell,
325;00:26:52,342;00:26:54,260;and all the smiles died.
326;00:26:55,595;00:26:57,897;I've never seen
326;00:26:55,595;00:26:57,897;so many people so quiet.
327;00:26:59,016;00:27:02,351;He rode past his wife
328;00:27:02,353;00:27:06,355;and he lay a crown of winter
328;00:27:02,353;00:27:06,355;roses in Lyanna's lap.
329;00:27:06,357;00:27:08,491;Blue as frost.
330;00:27:11,695;00:27:13,913;How many tens of
330;00:27:11,695;00:27:13,913;thousands had to die
331;00:27:13,997;00:27:16,278;because Rhaegar chose your aunt?
332;00:27:18,285;00:27:21,287;Yes, he chose her.
333;00:27:21,371;00:27:23,873;And then he kidnapped
333;00:27:21,371;00:27:23,873;her and raped her.
334;00:27:31,798;00:27:33,883;Come.
335;00:27:33,885;00:27:36,352;Let's speak somewhere
335;00:27:33,885;00:27:36,352;the dead can't hear us.
336;00:27:41,391;00:27:43,192;You're dressed for riding.
337;00:27:43,226;00:27:45,695;I am.
338;00:27:45,729;00:27:47,646;Where are you going?
339;00:27:47,731;00:27:49,648;King's Landing.
340;00:27:49,700;00:27:51,534;King's Landing?
341;00:27:51,568;00:27:53,402;Cersei sent for me.
342;00:27:53,453;00:27:56,155;We mustn't let her
342;00:27:53,453;00:27:56,155;sniff out any trouble.
343;00:27:56,239;00:27:57,823;You can't leave me here.
344;00:27:57,874;00:28:00,409;I know how hard it is to live
344;00:27:57,874;00:28:00,409;with people you despise.
345;00:28:00,460;00:28:02,128;Believe me.
346;00:28:02,162;00:28:04,130;But it won't be for long.
347;00:28:04,164;00:28:05,498;How do you know?
348;00:28:07,000;00:28:10,252;Stannis Baratheon
348;00:28:07,000;00:28:10,252;garrisons at Castle Black.
349;00:28:10,254;00:28:12,722;He'll march south
349;00:28:10,254;00:28:12,722;to King's Landing
350;00:28:12,756;00:28:14,724;before the winter snows
350;00:28:12,756;00:28:14,724;block his way.
351;00:28:14,758;00:28:17,727;But first he has
351;00:28:14,758;00:28:17,727;to take Winterfell.
352;00:28:17,761;00:28:20,262;You don't know that.
352;00:28:17,761;00:28:20,262;I do.
353;00:28:21,765;00:28:23,649;Once he liberates these
353;00:28:21,765;00:28:23,649;lands from the Boltons,
354;00:28:23,683;00:28:26,185;he'll rally your father's
354;00:28:23,683;00:28:26,185;bannermen to his cause.
355;00:28:26,236;00:28:28,154;With the North behind him,
356;00:28:28,188;00:28:30,689;Stannis can finally take
356;00:28:28,188;00:28:30,689;the Iron Throne.
357;00:28:30,774;00:28:33,492;You think he'll
357;00:28:30,774;00:28:33,492;defeat the Boltons?
358;00:28:33,527;00:28:35,244;He has a larger army.
359;00:28:35,278;00:28:37,830;He's the finest military
359;00:28:35,278;00:28:37,830;commander in Westeros.
360;00:28:37,864;00:28:41,417;A betting man would put
360;00:28:37,864;00:28:41,417;his money on Stannis.
361;00:28:41,451;00:28:43,953;As it happens,
361;00:28:41,451;00:28:43,953;I am a betting man.
362;00:28:45,455;00:28:47,206;And if you're right?
363;00:28:47,257;00:28:49,125;Stannis takes Winterfell,
364;00:28:49,176;00:28:52,136;he rescues you from the most
364;00:28:49,176;00:28:52,136;despised family in the North.
365;00:28:52,179;00:28:55,514;Grateful for your late father's
365;00:28:52,179;00:28:55,514;courageous support of his claim,
366;00:28:55,549;00:28:58,134;he names you
366;00:28:55,549;00:28:58,134;Wardeness of the North.
367;00:28:58,136;00:29:00,469;But I--
368;00:29:00,471;00:29:02,138;I wouldn't--
369;00:29:02,189;00:29:03,689;Wardeness of the North?
370;00:29:03,723;00:29:06,609;You are the last
370;00:29:03,723;00:29:06,609;surviving Stark.
371;00:29:06,643;00:29:08,360;He needs you.
372;00:29:08,395;00:29:09,645;And what if you're wrong?
373;00:29:09,696;00:29:11,397;What if Stannis never
373;00:29:09,696;00:29:11,397;attacks Winterfell?
374;00:29:11,448;00:29:14,116;Or he does and the
374;00:29:11,448;00:29:14,116;Boltons defeat him?
375;00:29:14,151;00:29:16,318;Then you will take
375;00:29:14,151;00:29:16,318;this Bolton boy, Ramsay,
376;00:29:16,320;00:29:18,070;and make him yours.
377;00:29:18,121;00:29:19,955;I don't know how to do that.
378;00:29:19,990;00:29:21,791;Of course you do.
379;00:29:21,825;00:29:23,626;He's already fallen for you.
380;00:29:23,660;00:29:25,661;His father frightens me.
381;00:29:25,663;00:29:29,165;He should.
381;00:29:25,663;00:29:29,165;He's a dangerous man.
382;00:29:29,216;00:29:32,885;But even the most dangerous
382;00:29:29,216;00:29:32,885;men can be outmaneuvered.
383;00:29:32,919;00:29:36,040;And you've learned to
383;00:29:32,919;00:29:36,040;maneuver from the very best.
384;00:29:37,924;00:29:40,426;I'll return before too long.
385;00:29:40,477;00:29:43,345;You'll be strong without me.
386;00:29:50,937;00:29:53,072;The North will be yours.
387;00:29:54,458;00:29:56,575;Do you believe me?
388;00:29:58,245;00:30:01,780;I expect I'll be a married
388;00:29:58,245;00:30:01,780;woman by the time you return.
389;00:31:05,595;00:31:07,263;Breakfast.
390;00:31:11,151;00:31:13,152;That would have been
390;00:31:11,151;00:31:13,152;a shit way to die.
391;00:31:13,186;00:31:16,272;As far as I've seen, they're
391;00:31:13,186;00:31:16,272;all shit ways to die.
392;00:31:16,274;00:31:19,692;Aye, but your lot have to give
392;00:31:16,274;00:31:19,692;the singers a good ending.
393;00:31:19,743;00:31:22,361;I don't care what's sung
393;00:31:19,743;00:31:22,361;about me when I'm dead.
394;00:31:22,412;00:31:24,496;No?
395;00:31:24,531;00:31:27,249;Two knights off
395;00:31:24,531;00:31:27,249;to rescue a princess.
396;00:31:27,284;00:31:29,118;Sounds like a good song to me.
397;00:31:29,169;00:31:31,503;Sounds like all the rest.
398;00:31:34,207;00:31:36,125;What about you?
399;00:31:36,176;00:31:38,594;What shit way would you choose?
400;00:31:39,846;00:31:42,881;In my own keep
400;00:31:39,846;00:31:42,881;drinking my own wine
401;00:31:42,933;00:31:45,253;watching my sons
401;00:31:42,933;00:31:45,253;grovel for my fortune.
402;00:31:46,303;00:31:48,637;How disappointing.
403;00:31:48,688;00:31:51,857;I thought you'd have something
403;00:31:48,688;00:31:51,857;more exciting planned.
404;00:31:51,891;00:31:54,143;I've had an exciting life.
405;00:31:54,145;00:31:56,386;I want my death to be boring.
406;00:31:57,948;00:31:59,865;How do you want to go?
407;00:31:59,899;00:32:02,318;In the arms of the woman I love.
408;00:32:05,655;00:32:08,123;She want the same thing?
409;00:32:13,213;00:32:14,830;Let's go.
410;00:32:24,641;00:32:26,675;The captain of that ship--
411;00:32:26,726;00:32:28,260;what was he, Braavosi?
412;00:32:28,311;00:32:30,012;Pentoshi.
413;00:32:30,063;00:32:31,680;And he's headed to Oldtown?
414;00:32:31,682;00:32:33,732;As I said.
414;00:32:31,682;00:32:33,732;Why?
415;00:32:33,767;00:32:36,568;What's to stop him from
415;00:32:33,767;00:32:36,568;docking down the coast
416;00:32:36,603;00:32:39,238;and telling the locals that
416;00:32:36,603;00:32:39,238;Jaime Lannister is in Dorne?
417;00:32:39,272;00:32:41,240;A bag of gold.
418;00:32:41,274;00:32:43,075;I'm not sure you understand
419;00:32:43,109;00:32:45,644;how much people hate your family
419;00:32:43,109;00:32:45,644;in this part of the world.
420;00:32:45,679;00:32:47,446;It was a heavy bag.
421;00:32:47,480;00:32:50,532;And I bet he swore all
421;00:32:47,480;00:32:50,532;kinds of oaths to get it.
422;00:32:50,534;00:32:52,368;But you won't be around
422;00:32:50,534;00:32:52,368;if he breaks 'em.
423;00:33:02,295;00:33:03,846;How many you count?
424;00:33:03,880;00:33:05,214;Four.
425;00:33:05,265;00:33:06,932;How many do you think
425;00:33:05,265;00:33:06,932;you can take?
426;00:33:07,017;00:33:09,118;One if he's slow.
427;00:33:12,972;00:33:14,523;Halt!
428;00:33:14,557;00:33:16,642;Over the hill.
429;00:33:18,361;00:33:20,529;Fucked in the ass.
430;00:33:24,651;00:33:26,235;Hyah!
431;00:33:30,156;00:33:32,491;Morning, lads.
432;00:33:32,542;00:33:34,576;Glad we found you.
433;00:33:34,578;00:33:36,045;Who are you?
434;00:33:36,079;00:33:38,047;Cooper.
435;00:33:38,081;00:33:40,382;This is Darnell.
436;00:33:40,417;00:33:41,750;You're from King's Landing.
437;00:33:41,801;00:33:43,585;Accent gave me away?
438;00:33:44,754;00:33:47,172;Flea Bottom,
438;00:33:44,754;00:33:47,172;whelped and whipped.
439;00:33:47,223;00:33:48,924;Why are you here?
440;00:33:48,975;00:33:50,759;Our ship capsized in the night.
441;00:33:50,761;00:33:52,094;We managed to swim ashore.
442;00:33:52,128;00:33:54,930;It was a near thing, really.
443;00:33:54,981;00:33:57,433;Thought the sharks would get us.
444;00:33:57,435;00:34:00,519;There are no sharks in Dorne.
445;00:34:01,738;00:34:05,023;Could have sworn
445;00:34:01,738;00:34:05,023;those were shark fins.
446;00:34:05,075;00:34:06,942;Dolphins, maybe.
447;00:34:08,528;00:34:10,112;Throw your swords in the sand.
448;00:34:10,114;00:34:12,915;Boys, there's no need for this.
449;00:34:12,949;00:34:15,417;Just point us
449;00:34:12,949;00:34:15,417;in the right direction,
450;00:34:15,452;00:34:17,169;we'll find our way home.
451;00:34:17,203;00:34:19,621;Swords in the sand now.
452;00:34:39,526;00:34:41,810;Hyah! Hyah!
453;00:34:47,400;00:34:49,241;That one should be slow enough.
454;00:35:43,206;00:35:44,873;Nice move.
455;00:35:46,125;00:35:48,210;Luck.
456;00:35:48,261;00:35:50,429;You had a wonderful teacher.
457;00:36:03,726;00:36:07,145;Always wanted
457;00:36:03,726;00:36:07,145;a Dornish stallion.
458;00:36:07,197;00:36:10,532;Beasts can run a day and
458;00:36:07,197;00:36:10,532;night without tiring.
459;00:36:10,567;00:36:12,401;We'll ride to the Water Gardens
460;00:36:12,403;00:36:14,119;with a nice breeze in our faces.
461;00:36:14,153;00:36:16,314;First we need
461;00:36:14,153;00:36:16,314;to bury these bodies.
462;00:36:16,906;00:36:18,156;Birds have to eat, too.
463;00:36:18,208;00:36:20,648;Corpses raise questions.
463;00:36:18,208;00:36:20,648;Questions raise armies.
464;00:36:20,660;00:36:23,078;We're not here to start a war.
465;00:36:23,080;00:36:25,881;Do you know how long it'll take
465;00:36:23,080;00:36:25,881;us to dig all those holes?
466;00:36:25,915;00:36:29,084;I can't dig very well
466;00:36:25,915;00:36:29,084;with one hand.
467;00:36:29,086;00:36:31,003;Not at all, really.
468;00:37:02,118;00:37:03,119;Mama.
469;00:37:09,459;00:37:10,959;Nym, Obara.
470;00:37:10,961;00:37:13,095;Will it be war?
471;00:37:13,129;00:37:15,631;Prince Doran will weep for
471;00:37:13,129;00:37:15,631;your father, but nothing else.
472;00:37:15,682;00:37:17,966;We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.
473;00:37:18,017;00:37:21,303;Without Doran, we have no army
473;00:37:18,017;00:37:21,303;to march against the Lannisters.
474;00:37:21,354;00:37:24,106;We don't need an army
474;00:37:21,354;00:37:24,106;to start a war.
475;00:37:24,140;00:37:27,893;Queen Cersei loves her children.
476;00:37:27,944;00:37:29,878;And we have one of them.
477;00:37:29,913;00:37:31,897;You may have a problem.
478;00:37:38,322;00:37:40,405;A ship's captain who
478;00:37:38,322;00:37:40,405;found me in Planky Town
479;00:37:40,456;00:37:42,074;claiming he had
479;00:37:40,456;00:37:42,074;information to sell.
480;00:37:42,125;00:37:46,078;He told me he smuggled
480;00:37:42,125;00:37:46,078;Jaime Lannister into Dorne.
481;00:37:47,380;00:37:49,498;He's come for Myrcella.
482;00:37:50,717;00:37:52,250;If he gets to her before we do,
483;00:37:52,302;00:37:55,220;we lose our only chance
483;00:37:52,302;00:37:55,220;for revenge.
484;00:37:55,254;00:37:58,590;You must choose.
485;00:37:58,641;00:38:00,509;Doran's way and peace,
486;00:38:00,511;00:38:03,345;or my way and war.
487;00:38:05,848;00:38:09,101;I'm with you always.
488;00:38:09,152;00:38:10,686;Nym?
489;00:38:14,791;00:38:17,075;Obara?
490;00:38:17,110;00:38:20,996;When I was a child, Oberyn
490;00:38:17,110;00:38:20,996;came to take me to court.
491;00:38:21,030;00:38:22,748;I had never seen this man,
492;00:38:22,782;00:38:25,334;and yet he called
492;00:38:22,782;00:38:25,334;himself my father.
493;00:38:25,368;00:38:26,835;My mother wept,
494;00:38:26,869;00:38:30,122;said I was too young and a girl.
495;00:38:32,625;00:38:35,544;Oberyn tossed his spear
495;00:38:32,625;00:38:35,544;at my feet and said,
496;00:38:35,546;00:38:38,547;Girl or boy,
496;00:38:35,546;00:38:38,547;we fight our battles,
497;00:38:38,549;00:38:41,767;but the gods let us
497;00:38:38,549;00:38:41,767;choose our weapons.
498;00:38:41,801;00:38:44,553;My father pointed to the spear
499;00:38:44,555;00:38:46,605;and then to my mother's tears.
500;00:38:54,230;00:38:56,565;I made my choice long ago.
501;00:38:58,651;00:39:01,787;Will you untie me?
502;00:39:01,821;00:39:04,823;Will you please untie me?
503;00:39:04,874;00:39:07,075;Will you please?
504;00:39:30,016;00:39:31,767;Thank you.
505;00:39:39,942;00:39:41,777;Who are you?
506;00:39:41,779;00:39:43,195;Your captor.
507;00:39:45,448;00:39:47,115;Do you have wine?
508;00:39:47,117;00:39:49,184;No.
509;00:39:49,218;00:39:51,086;Can't sleep without wine.
510;00:39:51,120;00:39:53,288;Then stay awake.
511;00:39:58,795;00:40:01,036;You're going the wrong way.
512;00:40:01,964;00:40:04,382;My sister is in Westeros.
513;00:40:04,434;00:40:07,269;Westeros is west.
514;00:40:07,303;00:40:08,804;We're heading east.
515;00:40:08,806;00:40:11,223;I'm not taking you
515;00:40:08,806;00:40:11,223;to your sister.
516;00:40:12,809;00:40:15,026;You said you were
516;00:40:12,809;00:40:15,026;taking me to the queen.
517;00:40:15,061;00:40:18,313;I am.
517;00:40:15,061;00:40:18,313;Queen Daenerys Targaryen.
518;00:40:18,315;00:40:20,065;She's the queen I serve.
519;00:40:26,656;00:40:29,991;What a waste
519;00:40:26,656;00:40:29,991;of a good kidnapping.
520;00:40:30,042;00:40:32,494;It so happens I was
520;00:40:30,042;00:40:32,494;heading there myself.
521;00:40:32,545;00:40:34,663;What business would you
521;00:40:32,545;00:40:34,663;have with the queen?
522;00:40:34,714;00:40:38,300;Gold and glory.
522;00:40:34,714;00:40:38,300;Oh, and hate.
523;00:40:38,334;00:40:41,052;If you'd ever met my sister,
523;00:40:38,334;00:40:41,052;you'd understand.
524;00:40:42,505;00:40:45,841;So, now that it's clear
524;00:40:42,505;00:40:45,841;we are on the same side...
525;00:40:55,518;00:40:58,854;A highborn knight from
525;00:40:55,518;00:40:58,854;the North of Westeros
526;00:40:58,905;00:41:01,406;down on his luck in Essos.
527;00:41:01,440;00:41:05,443;Dragon epaulets,
527;00:41:01,440;00:41:05,443;bear sigil breastplate.
528;00:41:06,863;00:41:08,864;You're Jorah Mormont.
529;00:41:08,948;00:41:11,666;I have to ask.
530;00:41:11,701;00:41:13,869;How exactly were you
530;00:41:11,701;00:41:13,869;serving your queen
531;00:41:13,920;00:41:16,705;in a whorehouse
531;00:41:13,920;00:41:16,705;half a world away?
532;00:41:16,756;00:41:19,374;Is it possible
532;00:41:16,756;00:41:19,374;that you were running?
533;00:41:19,376;00:41:21,960;Why would you be running?
534;00:41:22,011;00:41:24,196;And why would she
534;00:41:22,011;00:41:24,196;have sent you away?
535;00:41:24,230;00:41:27,465;Oh, wait.
536;00:41:27,517;00:41:30,719;You were spying
536;00:41:27,517;00:41:30,719;on her, weren't you?
537;00:41:30,721;00:41:32,387;It's all coming back to me.
538;00:41:32,389;00:41:34,856;I was drunk through most of
538;00:41:32,389;00:41:34,856;the small council meetings,
539;00:41:34,891;00:41:36,608;but it's all coming back.
540;00:41:36,692;00:41:40,478;You passed notes
540;00:41:36,692;00:41:40,478;to Varys's little birds.
541;00:41:40,530;00:41:43,732;She found out, didn't she?
542;00:41:43,783;00:41:47,219;Found out and exiled you.
543;00:41:47,253;00:41:51,990;Now you hope to win back
543;00:41:47,253;00:41:51,990;her favor with a gift.
544;00:41:52,041;00:41:54,209;Risky scheme.
545;00:41:54,243;00:41:56,912;One might even say desperate.
546;00:41:58,464;00:42:01,883;You think Daenerys will
546;00:41:58,464;00:42:01,883;execute me and pardon you?
547;00:42:03,336;00:42:05,696;I'd say the reverse
547;00:42:03,336;00:42:05,696;is just as likely.
548;00:42:26,909;00:42:29,778;Everyone looks happy
548;00:42:26,909;00:42:29,778;enough from up here.
549;00:42:31,163;00:42:33,582;What?
550;00:42:33,616;00:42:35,500;I was thinking about
550;00:42:33,616;00:42:35,500;all the times your brother
551;00:42:35,534;00:42:37,619;made me go with him
551;00:42:35,534;00:42:37,619;down from the Red Keep
552;00:42:37,670;00:42:39,421;into the streets
552;00:42:37,670;00:42:39,421;of King's Landing.
553;00:42:39,455;00:42:42,123;Why?
553;00:42:39,455;00:42:42,123;He liked to walk among the people.
554;00:42:42,174;00:42:44,426;He liked to sing to them.
555;00:42:44,460;00:42:45,961;He sang to them?
556;00:42:46,045;00:42:47,963;Yes.
557;00:42:48,014;00:42:50,334;Rhaegar would pick
557;00:42:48,014;00:42:50,334;a spot on the Hook
558;00:42:50,349;00:42:53,468;or the Street of Seeds
558;00:42:50,349;00:42:53,468;and then he'd sing.
559;00:42:53,470;00:42:55,103;Just like all
559;00:42:53,470;00:42:55,103;the other minstrels.
560;00:42:55,137;00:42:56,304;And what did you do?
561;00:42:56,306;00:42:57,939;I made sure no one killed him.
562;00:42:57,974;00:43:00,976;And I collected the money.
563;00:43:00,978;00:43:03,361;What? He liked to see
563;00:43:00,978;00:43:03,361;how much he could make.
564;00:43:03,396;00:43:05,563;He was good?
564;00:43:03,396;00:43:05,563;He was very good.
565;00:43:05,615;00:43:07,232;Viserys never told you?
566;00:43:07,283;00:43:10,368;He told me Rhaegar
566;00:43:07,283;00:43:10,368;was good at killing people.
567;00:43:10,403;00:43:12,070;Rhaegar never liked killing.
568;00:43:12,121;00:43:13,204;He loved singing.
569;00:43:13,239;00:43:15,323;And what did you do
569;00:43:13,239;00:43:15,323;with the money?
570;00:43:15,325;00:43:18,543;Well, one time, he gave it to the
570;00:43:15,325;00:43:18,543;next minstrel down the street.
571;00:43:18,577;00:43:21,246;One time, he gave it to an
571;00:43:18,577;00:43:21,246;orphanage in Flea Bottom.
572;00:43:21,297;00:43:25,050;One time, we got horribly drunk.
573;00:43:26,969;00:43:29,087;Your Grace.
574;00:43:29,138;00:43:32,724;Hizdahr is here, waiting
574;00:43:29,138;00:43:32,724;in the audience chamber.
575;00:43:32,758;00:43:34,592;How many others are there?
576;00:43:34,644;00:43:37,646;50? 100?
577;00:43:37,680;00:43:39,648;Will you be joining us,
577;00:43:37,680;00:43:39,648;Ser Barristan?
578;00:43:39,682;00:43:43,485;I think I can protect you
578;00:43:39,682;00:43:43,485;from Hizdahr zo Loraq.
579;00:43:43,519;00:43:46,021;I think I can protect me
579;00:43:43,519;00:43:46,021;from Hizdahr zo Loraq.
580;00:43:47,106;00:43:48,606;Go, Ser Barristan.
581;00:43:48,658;00:43:50,025;Sing a song for me.
582;00:43:50,076;00:43:52,527;Your Grace.
583;00:43:57,383;00:44:00,869;All men must die, but not
583;00:43:57,383;00:44:00,869;all can die in glory.
584;00:44:00,871;00:44:02,988;Glory?
584;00:44:00,871;00:44:02,988;Why else do men fight?
585;00:44:03,022;00:44:05,256;Why did your ancestors
585;00:44:03,022;00:44:05,256;cross the Narrow Sea
586;00:44:05,291;00:44:06,775;and conquer the Seven Kingdoms?
587;00:44:06,809;00:44:09,344;So their names would live on.
588;00:44:09,378;00:44:10,996;Those who find victory
588;00:44:09,378;00:44:10,996;in the fighting pits
589;00:44:11,030;00:44:14,349;will never become kings,
589;00:44:11,030;00:44:14,349;but their names will live on.
590;00:44:14,383;00:44:16,267;It's the best chance
590;00:44:14,383;00:44:16,267;they'll ever have.
591;00:44:16,302;00:44:17,886;Is that what
591;00:44:16,302;00:44:17,886;you used to tell men
592;00:44:17,888;00:44:20,805;before you set them to
592;00:44:17,888;00:44:20,805;butchering each other for sport?
593;00:44:20,856;00:44:23,608;Your Grace, today is the traditional
593;00:44:20,856;00:44:23,608;start of the fighting season.
594;00:44:23,642;00:44:25,560;I do not recognize
594;00:44:23,642;00:44:25,560;this tradition.
595;00:44:25,611;00:44:28,730;Traditions are the only thing
595;00:44:25,611;00:44:28,730;that will hold this city,
596;00:44:28,732;00:44:30,465;your city, together.
597;00:44:31,901;00:44:34,536;Without them, former
597;00:44:31,901;00:44:34,536;slaves and former masters
598;00:44:34,570;00:44:36,731;have nothing in common.
599;00:44:37,740;00:44:42,410;Nothing but centuries
599;00:44:37,740;00:44:42,410;of mistrust and resentment.
600;00:44:42,461;00:44:46,047;I can't promise this is the
600;00:44:42,461;00:44:46,047;answer to all our problems,
601;00:44:46,082;00:44:48,416;but it's a start.
