3;00:01:56,479;00:01:58,612;Yes?
4;00:02:00,549;00:02:02,616;For you, my lady.
5;00:02:21,637;00:02:24,071;How far is Mole's Town?
6;00:02:31,914;00:02:33,414;Sansa.
7;00:02:37,319;00:02:39,153;Lady Brienne.
8;00:02:41,791;00:02:45,092;When I heard you had
8;00:02:41,791;00:02:45,092;escaped Winterfell, I feared the worst.
9;00:02:47,063;00:02:49,329;You have no idea
9;00:02:47,063;00:02:49,329;how happy I am
10;00:02:49,432;00:02:51,098;to see you unharmed.
11;00:02:52,234;00:02:54,468;Unharmed?
12;00:02:54,570;00:02:56,270;What are you doing here?
13;00:02:56,372;00:02:59,239;I rode north with the Knights of the Vale
13;00:02:56,372;00:02:59,239;to come to your aid.
14;00:02:59,341;00:03:02,176;They're encamped
14;00:02:59,341;00:03:02,176;at Moat Cailin as we speak.
15;00:03:02,278;00:03:04,078;To come to my aid?
16;00:03:05,715;00:03:08,415;Did you know
16;00:03:05,715;00:03:08,415;about Ramsay?
17;00:03:08,517;00:03:10,751;If you didn't know,
17;00:03:08,517;00:03:10,751;you're an idiot.
18;00:03:10,853;00:03:12,619;If you did know,
18;00:03:10,853;00:03:12,619;you're my enemy.
19;00:03:13,989;00:03:16,724;Would you like to hear
19;00:03:13,989;00:03:16,724;about our wedding night?
20;00:03:18,894;00:03:21,128;He never hurt my face.
21;00:03:21,230;00:03:24,765;He needed my face,
21;00:03:21,230;00:03:24,765;the face of Ned Stark's daughter.
22;00:03:29,305;00:03:31,839;But the rest of me,
23;00:03:31,941;00:03:34,041;he did what he liked
23;00:03:31,941;00:03:34,041;with the rest of me
24;00:03:34,143;00:03:37,444;as long as I could
24;00:03:34,143;00:03:37,444;still give him an heir.
25;00:03:40,349;00:03:42,082;What do you
25;00:03:40,349;00:03:42,082;think he did?
26;00:03:46,222;00:03:48,122;I can't begin
26;00:03:46,222;00:03:48,122;to contemplate--
27;00:03:48,224;00:03:50,224;What do you think
27;00:03:48,224;00:03:50,224;he did to me?
28;00:03:58,501;00:04:01,668;Lady Sansa asked you
28;00:03:58,501;00:04:01,668;a question.
29;00:04:01,771;00:04:03,237;He beat you.
30;00:04:03,339;00:04:04,605;Yes, he enjoyed that.
31;00:04:04,707;00:04:06,206;What else do you
31;00:04:04,707;00:04:06,206;think he did?
32;00:04:06,308;00:04:08,475;Sansa, I--
32;00:04:06,308;00:04:08,475;What else?
33;00:04:11,147;00:04:12,646;Did he cut you?
34;00:04:14,650;00:04:16,603;Maybe you did know
34;00:04:14,650;00:04:16,603;about Ramsay all along.
35;00:04:16,627;00:04:17,552;I didn't know.
36;00:04:17,553;00:04:19,453;I thought you knew
36;00:04:17,553;00:04:19,453;everyone's secrets.
37;00:04:19,555;00:04:22,890;I made a mistake,
37;00:04:19,555;00:04:22,890;a horrible mistake.
38;00:04:22,992;00:04:24,591;I underestimated
38;00:04:22,992;00:04:24,591;a stranger.
39;00:04:26,162;00:04:27,661;The other things he did,
40;00:04:27,763;00:04:29,563;ladies aren't supposed
40;00:04:27,763;00:04:29,563;to talk about those things,
41;00:04:29,665;00:04:32,499;but I imagine brothel keepers talk
41;00:04:29,665;00:04:32,499;about them all the time.
42;00:04:35,004;00:04:37,304;I can still feel it.
43;00:04:37,406;00:04:40,541;I don't mean in my tender heart
43;00:04:37,406;00:04:40,541;it still pains me so.
44;00:04:40,643;00:04:44,511;I can still feel what he did in my body
44;00:04:40,643;00:04:44,511;standing here right now.
45;00:04:46,982;00:04:50,050;I'm so sorry.
46;00:04:50,152;00:04:52,052;You said
46;00:04:50,152;00:04:52,052;you would protect me.
47;00:04:52,154;00:04:53,368;And I will.
48;00:04:53,392;00:04:55,789;You must believe me when
48;00:04:53,392;00:04:55,789;I tell you that I will.
49;00:04:55,791;00:04:59,259;I don't believe you anymore.
49;00:04:55,791;00:04:59,259;I don't need you anymore.
50;00:04:59,361;00:05:01,161;You can't protect me.
51;00:05:01,263;00:05:03,130;You won't even be able
51;00:05:01,263;00:05:03,130;to protect yourself
52;00:05:03,232;00:05:05,499;if I tell Brienne
52;00:05:03,232;00:05:05,499;to cut you down.
53;00:05:08,070;00:05:09,469;And why shouldn't I?
54;00:05:12,408;00:05:14,641;Do you want me
54;00:05:12,408;00:05:14,641;to beg for my life?
55;00:05:14,743;00:05:17,077;If that's what
55;00:05:14,743;00:05:17,077;you want, I will.
56;00:05:19,114;00:05:21,582;Whatever you ask
56;00:05:19,114;00:05:21,582;that is in my power,
57;00:05:21,684;00:05:22,883;I will do.
58;00:05:22,985;00:05:26,820;What if I want you
58;00:05:22,985;00:05:26,820;to die here and now?
59;00:05:28,591;00:05:30,557;Then I will die.
60;00:05:32,394;00:05:35,896;You freed me from the monsters
60;00:05:32,394;00:05:35,896;who murdered my family
61;00:05:35,998;00:05:40,033;and you gave me to other monsters
61;00:05:35,998;00:05:40,033;who murdered my family.
62;00:05:41,704;00:05:43,770;Go back to Moat Cailin.
63;00:05:43,873;00:05:46,273;My brother and I will take
63;00:05:43,873;00:05:46,273;back the North on our own.
64;00:05:46,375;00:05:47,908;I never want
64;00:05:46,375;00:05:47,908;to see you again.
65;00:05:48,010;00:05:51,245;I would do anything to undo
65;00:05:48,010;00:05:51,245;what's been done to you.
66;00:05:54,216;00:05:55,916;I know that I can't.
67;00:05:57,953;00:06:00,687;Will you allow me to say
67;00:05:57,953;00:06:00,687;one more thing before I go?
68;00:06:03,726;00:06:06,860;Your great-uncle
68;00:06:03,726;00:06:06,860;Brynden the Blackfish
69;00:06:06,962;00:06:10,631;has gathered what remains of the
69;00:06:06,962;00:06:10,631;Tully forces and retaken Riverrun.
70;00:06:10,733;00:06:12,866;You might consider
70;00:06:10,733;00:06:12,866;seeking him out.
71;00:06:12,968;00:06:16,270;The time may come
71;00:06:12,968;00:06:16,270;when you need an army loyal to you.
72;00:06:16,372;00:06:17,372;I have an army.
73;00:06:17,439;00:06:19,439;Your brother's army.
74;00:06:27,917;00:06:28,982;Half-brother.
75;00:06:58,681;00:06:59,980;You're not ready.
76;00:07:02,318;00:07:05,185;You should go home
76;00:07:02,318;00:07:05,185;before it's too late.
77;00:08:01,543;00:08:05,145;You'll never be
77;00:08:01,543;00:08:05,145;one of us, Lady Stark.
78;00:08:20,262;00:08:22,029;She has a point.
79;00:08:27,903;00:08:31,505;None of the first Faceless Men
79;00:08:27,903;00:08:31,505;were born to lords and ladies.
80;00:08:31,607;00:08:34,574;They began as slaves
80;00:08:31,607;00:08:34,574;in the mines of Valyria.
81;00:08:34,676;00:08:36,209;Who was the first?
82;00:08:36,311;00:08:37,711;He was no one.
83;00:08:39,048;00:08:42,049;The Many-Faced God taught
83;00:08:39,048;00:08:42,049;him how to shed his face
84;00:08:42,151;00:08:43,784;and how to give
84;00:08:42,151;00:08:43,784;the gift.
85;00:08:43,886;00:08:47,320;The man taught others in exchange
85;00:08:43,886;00:08:47,320;for their service.
86;00:08:47,423;00:08:50,857;Many served, many more gifts
86;00:08:47,423;00:08:50,857;were given.
87;00:08:50,959;00:08:53,827;Soon all the masters
87;00:08:50,959;00:08:53,827;and overseers were gone
88;00:08:53,929;00:08:56,129;and the Faceless
88;00:08:53,929;00:08:56,129;Men fled.
89;00:08:56,231;00:08:58,031;Where did they go?
90;00:08:58,133;00:08:59,733;Here.
91;00:08:59,835;00:09:03,136;They founded the Free City of Braavos
91;00:08:59,835;00:09:03,136;and built this house.
92;00:09:04,540;00:09:07,474;These were the faces
92;00:09:04,540;00:09:07,474;they wore in life
93;00:09:07,576;00:09:10,110;when they were not
93;00:09:07,576;00:09:10,110;wearing others.
94;00:09:10,212;00:09:12,979;The first Faceless Men.
95;00:09:14,516;00:09:16,316;And now a girl
95;00:09:14,516;00:09:16,316;is one of them,
96;00:09:16,418;00:09:18,618;if a girl desires.
97;00:09:20,055;00:09:22,289;A girl has no desires.
98;00:09:29,531;00:09:31,098;Who?
99;00:09:38,574;00:09:41,308;An actress who calls
99;00:09:38,574;00:09:41,308;herself Lady Crane.
100;00:09:41,410;00:09:44,277;She performs at the theater
100;00:09:41,410;00:09:44,277;in Sheelba Square.
101;00:09:46,081;00:09:49,015;A girl has been given
101;00:09:46,081;00:09:49,015;a second chance.
102;00:09:49,118;00:09:51,318;There will not be a third.
103;00:09:51,420;00:09:53,520;One way or another,
104;00:09:53,622;00:09:56,623;a face will be
104;00:09:53,622;00:09:56,623;added to the hall.
105;00:10:15,777;00:10:18,478;Ahh!
106;00:10:20,415;00:10:23,150;Oh, murdered by a boar.
107;00:10:23,252;00:10:25,819;The great big
107;00:10:23,252;00:10:25,819;hairy whore.
108;00:10:25,921;00:10:29,489;He dug in his tusks
108;00:10:25,921;00:10:29,489;and dug out my guts
109;00:10:29,591;00:10:33,026;and soon I am no more.
110;00:10:33,128;00:10:36,029;Oh, come, Father,
110;00:10:33,128;00:10:36,029;in bed you must lie.
111;00:10:36,131;00:10:39,032;I love you, Father.
111;00:10:36,131;00:10:39,032;Please don't die.
112;00:10:39,134;00:10:42,802;Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine.
113;00:10:42,905;00:10:46,640;I feel the winds of winter
113;00:10:42,905;00:10:46,640;as they lick across the land.
114;00:10:46,742;00:10:50,143;And our son alone
114;00:10:46,742;00:10:50,143;on that cold, cold throne
115;00:10:50,245;00:10:52,379;without a guiding hand.
116;00:10:52,481;00:10:55,749;Who will teach him strength?
116;00:10:52,481;00:10:55,749;Who will teach him grace?
117;00:10:55,851;00:10:59,753;To whom will he turn when it's time
117;00:10:55,851;00:10:59,753;to learn to look darkness in the face?
118;00:10:59,855;00:11:03,423;Ned Stark will do fine.
118;00:10:59,855;00:11:03,423;Now bring me more wine.
119;00:11:05,994;00:11:07,827;Ooh!
120;00:11:07,930;00:11:10,497;Ooh, what's happened
120;00:11:07,930;00:11:10,497;here, then?
121;00:11:10,599;00:11:12,432;He brought you here,
121;00:11:10,599;00:11:12,432;Ned Stark,
122;00:11:12,534;00:11:14,935;'cause you're
122;00:11:12,534;00:11:14,935;the brightest fellow in the land.
123;00:11:15,037;00:11:16,603;You should be king
123;00:11:15,037;00:11:16,603;of us all
124;00:11:16,705;00:11:18,905;and I should be
124;00:11:16,705;00:11:18,905;your Hand.
125;00:11:19,007;00:11:21,241;We men of the North
125;00:11:19,007;00:11:21,241;are right good hands
126;00:11:21,343;00:11:23,143;at keeping
126;00:11:21,343;00:11:23,143;people lawful.
127;00:11:23,245;00:11:24,878;I'd ask him
127;00:11:23,245;00:11:24,878;for permission,
128;00:11:24,980;00:11:27,147;but he smells
128;00:11:24,980;00:11:27,147;too bloody awful.
129;00:11:28,984;00:11:32,219;I die! I die!
130;00:11:32,321;00:11:35,488;And here I now must lie.
131;00:11:35,591;00:11:39,192;Oh, woe.
131;00:11:35,591;00:11:39,192;Oh, no.
132;00:11:40,929;00:11:45,165;Oh, I am about to go.
133;00:11:47,336;00:11:49,269;Will you stay on
133;00:11:47,336;00:11:49,269;as Joffrey's Hand?
134;00:11:49,371;00:11:51,304;The Iron Throne's
134;00:11:49,371;00:11:51,304;what I demand.
135;00:11:51,406;00:11:52,305;You cannot.
135;00:11:51,406;00:11:52,305;I can.
136;00:11:52,407;00:11:53,306;You will not.
136;00:11:52,407;00:11:53,306;I will.
137;00:11:53,408;00:11:55,075;You dare not.
137;00:11:53,408;00:11:55,075;I dare yes.
138;00:11:55,177;00:11:57,277;The line of succession.
138;00:11:55,177;00:11:57,277;What's that mean?
139;00:11:57,379;00:11:59,145;The proper progression.
139;00:11:57,379;00:11:59,145;What's that mean?
140;00:11:59,248;00:12:01,681;The lawful ascension.
140;00:11:59,248;00:12:01,681;What's that mean?
141;00:12:13,629;00:12:16,896;So move along,
141;00:12:13,629;00:12:16,896;give me my chair
142;00:12:16,999;00:12:19,099;and there won't be
142;00:12:16,999;00:12:19,099;no more trouble.
143;00:12:22,404;00:12:25,205;But we had a deal
143;00:12:22,404;00:12:25,205;all done and dusted.
144;00:12:25,307;00:12:28,508;I'm starting to think
144;00:12:25,307;00:12:28,508;you can't be trusted.
145;00:12:38,987;00:12:40,854;Save my father.
146;00:12:40,956;00:12:44,391;Truly you should.
146;00:12:40,956;00:12:44,391;Killing the man will do you no good.
147;00:12:44,493;00:12:46,760;Save him, please.
147;00:12:44,493;00:12:46,760;Show him mercy.
148;00:12:46,862;00:12:49,362;Show the people what
148;00:12:46,862;00:12:49,362;a good king should be.
149;00:12:49,464;00:12:51,698;Good people,
149;00:12:49,464;00:12:51,698;you may all relax.
150;00:12:51,800;00:12:53,933;My father's friend
150;00:12:51,800;00:12:53,933;shall be spared the--
151;00:12:56,271;00:12:59,439;Father! No!
152;00:12:59,541;00:13:02,208;Oh, Father.
152;00:12:59,541;00:13:02,208;Oh!
153;00:13:11,486;00:13:12,919;Worry not!
154;00:13:13,021;00:13:14,521;All is well.
155;00:13:14,623;00:13:16,523;I have here a decree
156;00:13:16,625;00:13:19,392;from my father
156;00:13:16,625;00:13:19,392;Tywin Lannister,
157;00:13:19,494;00:13:21,594;the richest man
157;00:13:19,494;00:13:21,594;you'll see.
158;00:13:21,697;00:13:24,230;He proclaims me
158;00:13:21,697;00:13:24,230;Hand of the King.
159;00:13:24,333;00:13:26,132;The position's
159;00:13:24,333;00:13:26,132;mine for life.
160;00:13:26,234;00:13:28,601;And he's given me
160;00:13:26,234;00:13:28,601;permission to take
161;00:13:28,704;00:13:30,837;Sansa as my wife.
162;00:13:33,642;00:13:35,675;You'll learn that
162;00:13:33,642;00:13:35,675;what I lack in height,
163;00:13:35,777;00:13:38,011;I make up for in appetite.
164;00:13:38,113;00:13:40,480;So let's forget
164;00:13:38,113;00:13:40,480;about your plight,
165;00:13:40,582;00:13:42,682;and go rehearse
165;00:13:40,582;00:13:42,682;our wedding night.
166;00:13:52,127;00:13:54,894;It's a wart.
166;00:13:52,127;00:13:54,894;Two warts.
167;00:13:54,996;00:13:56,830;I've got two fucking
167;00:13:54,996;00:13:56,830;warts on my cock.
168;00:13:56,932;00:13:58,001;Well, don't worry, love.
169;00:13:58,025;00:14:00,396;They usually go away in
169;00:13:58,025;00:14:00,396;five or six years.
170;00:14:00,869;00:14:04,137;Oh, wash this, darling.
170;00:14:00,869;00:14:04,137;It stinks of me.
171;00:14:04,239;00:14:07,474;You can do better, Bianca, dear.
171;00:14:04,239;00:14:07,474;You must do.
172;00:14:07,576;00:14:09,242;I had two lines.
173;00:14:09,344;00:14:11,544;There are no small parts.
173;00:14:09,344;00:14:11,544;You rang very false.
174;00:14:11,646;00:14:13,213;I rang very false?
175;00:14:13,315;00:14:16,216;What you need, love,
175;00:14:13,315;00:14:16,216;is for someone to ring you true.
176;00:14:18,120;00:14:20,687;You weren't complaining
176;00:14:18,120;00:14:20,687;about me last night.
177;00:14:20,789;00:14:22,749;May I get you some wine,
177;00:14:20,789;00:14:22,749;Lady Crane?
178;00:14:22,824;00:14:24,891;I'm a rum girl, Bobono.
179;00:14:24,993;00:14:27,227;You need to know
179;00:14:24,993;00:14:27,227;that if we're going to be intimate.
180;00:14:27,329;00:14:28,895;Of course we're going
180;00:14:27,329;00:14:28,895;to be intimate.
181;00:14:28,997;00:14:31,564;It's only
181;00:14:28,997;00:14:31,564;a matter of time.
182;00:14:34,269;00:14:36,269;To our children.
183;00:14:36,371;00:14:38,371;May they have
183;00:14:36,371;00:14:38,371;your talent.
184;00:14:38,473;00:14:40,373;And your filthy mind.
185;00:14:47,082;00:14:49,482;A girl
185;00:14:47,082;00:14:49,482;will poison the rum.
186;00:14:49,584;00:14:51,818;Lady Crane is the only
186;00:14:49,584;00:14:51,818;one who drinks it.
187;00:14:55,824;00:14:58,925;If a girl could use
187;00:14:55,824;00:14:58,925;one of the faces from the hall...
188;00:14:59,027;00:15:01,161;A girl is not ready.
189;00:15:03,632;00:15:06,132;She's a good actress.
190;00:15:06,234;00:15:08,568;So a man has heard.
191;00:15:08,670;00:15:11,504;Seems like
191;00:15:08,670;00:15:11,504;a decent woman.
192;00:15:14,509;00:15:17,944;Does death only come for the wicked
192;00:15:14,509;00:15:17,944;and leave the decent behind?
193;00:15:20,081;00:15:21,581;No.
194;00:15:25,320;00:15:26,886;Who wants her dead?
195;00:15:26,988;00:15:29,789;That does not matter.
195;00:15:26,988;00:15:29,789;The price was paid.
196;00:15:31,593;00:15:34,561;The younger actress.
197;00:15:34,663;00:15:37,997;She's jealous because
197;00:15:34,663;00:15:37,997;Lady Crane is better.
198;00:15:38,099;00:15:41,601;A girl must decide if she wants
198;00:15:38,099;00:15:41,601;to serve the Many-Faced God.
199;00:15:43,038;00:15:44,771;A girl has decided.
200;00:15:44,873;00:15:48,508;A servant does not
200;00:15:44,873;00:15:48,508;ask questions.
201;00:16:58,046;00:17:00,446;No! No! No!
202;00:17:23,538;00:17:25,838;It was you.
203;00:17:25,941;00:17:27,640;You made
203;00:17:25,941;00:17:27,640;the white walkers.
204;00:17:27,742;00:17:29,876;We were at war.
205;00:17:29,978;00:17:32,378;We were being
205;00:17:29,978;00:17:32,378;slaughtered.
206;00:17:32,480;00:17:34,914;Our sacred trees
206;00:17:32,480;00:17:34,914;cut down.
207;00:17:35,016;00:17:37,717;We needed
207;00:17:35,016;00:17:37,717;to defend ourselves.
208;00:17:37,819;00:17:39,319;From whom?
209;00:17:39,421;00:17:41,955;From you.
210;00:17:42,057;00:17:44,257;From men.
211;00:17:52,901;00:17:56,603;We speak in the presence
211;00:17:52,901;00:17:56,603;of the Drowned God.
212;00:17:56,705;00:17:58,771;In his name
212;00:17:56,705;00:17:58,771;we gather today
213;00:17:58,873;00:18:02,475;to choose a new king
213;00:17:58,873;00:18:02,475;as our leader.
214;00:18:02,577;00:18:04,444;Who makes a claim?
215;00:18:09,351;00:18:11,618;I am Yara Greyjoy,
216;00:18:11,720;00:18:14,120;daughter of Balon Greyjoy,
217;00:18:14,222;00:18:16,456;King of the Iron Islands.
218;00:18:17,792;00:18:19,726;I claim the Salt Throne.
219;00:18:19,828;00:18:22,395;We've never had a queen.
219;00:18:19,828;00:18:22,395;Not once.
220;00:18:22,497;00:18:24,931;There are many things
220;00:18:22,497;00:18:24,931;we've never done.
221;00:18:25,033;00:18:27,767;We've never made our mark
221;00:18:25,033;00:18:27,767;upon the world.
222;00:18:27,869;00:18:31,304;The great lords
222;00:18:27,869;00:18:31,304;of Westeros pay us no mind
223;00:18:31,406;00:18:34,440;until our little raids
223;00:18:31,406;00:18:34,440;buzz through their kingdoms
224;00:18:34,542;00:18:36,175;long enough
224;00:18:34,542;00:18:36,175;to become a nuisance.
225;00:18:36,277;00:18:38,544;Then they swat us down.
226;00:18:38,647;00:18:42,148;They conquer us,
226;00:18:38,647;00:18:42,148;humiliate us,
227;00:18:42,250;00:18:44,684;and go right back
227;00:18:42,250;00:18:44,684;to forgetting we exist.
228;00:18:44,786;00:18:46,686;Aye!
229;00:18:46,788;00:18:49,122;We are a sea people.
229;00:18:46,788;00:18:49,122;Aye!
230;00:18:49,224;00:18:52,492;Our god is a sea god.
230;00:18:49,224;00:18:52,492;Aye!
231;00:18:52,594;00:18:54,727;When I am queen, we will
231;00:18:52,594;00:18:54,727;build a fleet that--
232;00:18:54,829;00:18:56,529;You shall not be queen!
232;00:18:54,829;00:18:56,529;I am not finished!
233;00:18:56,631;00:18:59,198;Yes, you are!
233;00:18:56,631;00:18:59,198;A woman will not lead us.
234;00:18:59,300;00:19:02,635;Not when Balon's
234;00:18:59,300;00:19:02,635;own male heir has returned.
235;00:19:29,664;00:19:31,698;I am Theon Greyjoy...
236;00:19:33,168;00:19:36,069;last living son
236;00:19:33,168;00:19:36,069;of Balon Greyjoy.
237;00:19:44,112;00:19:46,713;And she is your
237;00:19:44,112;00:19:46,713;rightful ruler.
238;00:19:46,815;00:19:48,047;Aye!
239;00:19:48,149;00:19:49,749;Those of you that have
239;00:19:48,149;00:19:49,749;sailed under her,
240;00:19:49,851;00:19:51,751;and there are many
240;00:19:49,851;00:19:51,751;of you here,
241;00:19:51,853;00:19:54,454;you know what she is.
241;00:19:51,853;00:19:54,454;Aye!
242;00:19:54,556;00:19:55,855;She is a reaver.
242;00:19:54,556;00:19:55,855;Aye!
243;00:19:55,957;00:19:58,191;She is a warrior.
243;00:19:55,957;00:19:58,191;Aye!
244;00:19:58,293;00:20:00,059;She is ironborn!
245;00:20:00,161;00:20:01,761;Aye!
246;00:20:01,863;00:20:04,430;We will find
246;00:20:01,863;00:20:04,430;no better leader.
247;00:20:07,502;00:20:09,302;This is our queen.
248;00:20:14,576;00:20:18,511;Yara! Yara! Yara!
249;00:20:18,613;00:20:21,214;I'm Euron Greyjoy.
250;00:20:21,316;00:20:23,750;I claim
250;00:20:21,316;00:20:23,750;the Salt Throne.
251;00:20:34,896;00:20:36,395;Niece.
252;00:20:37,966;00:20:38,966;Nephew.
253;00:20:40,835;00:20:42,635;Little Theon.
254;00:20:44,305;00:20:47,240;Heard you managed to fuck things
254;00:20:44,305;00:20:47,240;right into the ground.
255;00:20:48,877;00:20:50,743;Captured a castle
255;00:20:48,877;00:20:50,743;you couldn't keep.
256;00:20:50,845;00:20:53,846;Got yourself
256;00:20:50,845;00:20:53,846;taken prisoner.
257;00:20:53,948;00:20:56,149;Even heard
257;00:20:53,948;00:20:56,149;you have no cock.
258;00:21:00,088;00:21:02,421;Explains why you think
258;00:21:00,088;00:21:02,421;a woman can be king.
259;00:21:02,524;00:21:04,290;When did you
259;00:21:02,524;00:21:04,290;return, Uncle?
260;00:21:04,392;00:21:06,592;A few days ago.
261;00:21:06,694;00:21:09,061;I had some things
261;00:21:06,694;00:21:09,061;to take care of.
262;00:21:09,164;00:21:10,930;Long overdue.
263;00:21:12,233;00:21:13,800;I'm glad you're here.
264;00:21:15,870;00:21:19,539;Now I know what my first act
264;00:21:15,870;00:21:19,539;as queen will be.
265;00:21:19,641;00:21:22,475;To execute the man
265;00:21:19,641;00:21:22,475;who killed my father.
266;00:21:28,917;00:21:30,383;I did.
267;00:21:30,485;00:21:32,618;I killed him.
268;00:21:34,088;00:21:36,689;Threw him right over
268;00:21:34,088;00:21:36,689;a rope bridge
269;00:21:36,791;00:21:39,959;and watched him fall.
270;00:21:40,061;00:21:41,727;He was leading us
270;00:21:40,061;00:21:41,727;nowhere
271;00:21:41,830;00:21:44,463;and we would still be heading there
271;00:21:41,830;00:21:44,463;if it weren't for me.
272;00:21:44,566;00:21:47,633;No one loved him.
272;00:21:44,566;00:21:47,633;No one wanted to follow him.
273;00:21:47,735;00:21:50,469;He led us into two wars
273;00:21:47,735;00:21:50,469;we couldn't win.
274;00:21:50,572;00:21:54,540;I apologize to you all
274;00:21:50,572;00:21:54,540;for not killing him years ago.
275;00:21:54,642;00:21:56,843;That would have
275;00:21:54,642;00:21:56,843;been hard to do.
276;00:21:56,945;00:21:58,911;You weren't here.
277;00:21:59,013;00:22:02,582;Last I heard, you were gallivanting
277;00:21:59,013;00:22:02,582;around the world having a grand old time.
278;00:22:02,684;00:22:04,150;Gallivanting?
279;00:22:04,252;00:22:05,952;That the sort of thing
279;00:22:04,252;00:22:05,952;you start to say
280;00:22:06,054;00:22:08,487;once your dick gets chopped off?
281;00:22:08,590;00:22:11,424;Did the great lords
281;00:22:08,590;00:22:11,424;of Westeros teach you words like that?
282;00:22:12,794;00:22:14,594;You were gone.
283;00:22:14,696;00:22:16,195;Yara was here.
284;00:22:16,297;00:22:18,998;Being ironborn.
284;00:22:16,297;00:22:18,998;Leading ironborn.
285;00:22:19,100;00:22:22,001;Getting ready to bring us
285;00:22:19,100;00:22:22,001;back to glory.
286;00:22:22,103;00:22:23,569;And how will she do that?
287;00:22:23,671;00:22:28,040;I will build the largest fleet
287;00:22:23,671;00:22:28,040;the world has ever seen.
288;00:22:30,245;00:22:34,447;Right idea, except I'm the one
288;00:22:30,245;00:22:34,447;who's going to build the Iron Fleet
289;00:22:34,549;00:22:36,849;because I'm the one
289;00:22:34,549;00:22:36,849;who knows how to use it.
290;00:22:36,951;00:22:38,417;I've been
290;00:22:36,951;00:22:38,417;all over the world.
291;00:22:38,519;00:22:41,854;I've seen more of it
291;00:22:38,519;00:22:41,854;than all of you combined.
292;00:22:41,956;00:22:44,891;And across the sea
292;00:22:41,956;00:22:44,891;there is a person
293;00:22:44,993;00:22:48,828;who hates the great
293;00:22:44,993;00:22:48,828;lords of Westeros just as much as we do.
294;00:22:48,930;00:22:51,530;Someone with
294;00:22:48,930;00:22:51,530;a large army,
295;00:22:51,633;00:22:55,401;three large dragons,
295;00:22:51,633;00:22:55,401;and no husband.
296;00:22:55,503;00:22:57,737;I'm going to build
296;00:22:55,503;00:22:57,737;that fleet
297;00:22:57,839;00:23:00,039;and I'm going
297;00:22:57,839;00:23:00,039;to gallivant right over
298;00:23:00,141;00:23:02,275;and give it
298;00:23:00,141;00:23:02,275;to Daenerys Targaryen
299;00:23:02,377;00:23:04,777;along with my big cock.
300;00:23:04,879;00:23:06,879;You're going to seduce
300;00:23:04,879;00:23:06,879;the Dragon Queen?
301;00:23:06,981;00:23:10,216;I'm not going to seduce her.
301;00:23:06,981;00:23:10,216;The Iron Fleet will seduce her.
302;00:23:10,318;00:23:13,119;And together we're going
302;00:23:10,318;00:23:13,119;to take the Seven Kingdoms.
303;00:23:13,221;00:23:16,589;I wasn't born to be king.
304;00:23:16,691;00:23:19,191;I paid the iron price
305;00:23:19,294;00:23:20,760;and here I stand.
306;00:23:22,597;00:23:26,299;Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!
307;00:23:26,401;00:23:30,336;Euron! Euron!
307;00:23:26,401;00:23:30,336;Euron! Euron!
308;00:23:30,438;00:23:32,605;Euron! Euron!
309;00:23:43,718;00:23:46,519;May Euron, your servant,
309;00:23:43,718;00:23:46,519;be born again
310;00:23:46,621;00:23:49,155;from the sea as you were.
311;00:23:49,257;00:23:52,325;Bless him with salt.
311;00:23:49,257;00:23:52,325;Bless him with stone.
312;00:23:52,427;00:23:54,327;Bless him with steel.
313;00:23:54,429;00:23:57,063;Listen to the waves.
313;00:23:54,429;00:23:57,063;Listen to the god.
314;00:23:57,165;00:24:00,299;He is speaking to us
314;00:23:57,165;00:24:00,299;and he says
315;00:24:00,401;00:24:05,438;we shall have no king
315;00:24:00,401;00:24:05,438;but Euron Greyjoy.
316;00:24:05,540;00:24:08,741;Let the sea wash your follies
316;00:24:05,540;00:24:08,741;and your vanities away.
317;00:24:08,843;00:24:11,110;Let the old Euron drown.
318;00:24:11,212;00:24:14,013;Let his lungs
318;00:24:11,212;00:24:14,013;fill with seawater.
319;00:24:19,721;00:24:22,989;Let the fish eat
319;00:24:19,721;00:24:22,989;the scales off his eyes.
320;00:24:23,091;00:24:25,658;What is dead
320;00:24:23,091;00:24:25,658;may never die,
321;00:24:25,760;00:24:29,395;but rises again
321;00:24:25,760;00:24:29,395;harder and stronger.
322;00:25:36,597;00:25:38,731;What is dead
322;00:25:36,597;00:25:38,731;may never die.
323;00:25:38,833;00:25:42,068;What is dead
323;00:25:38,833;00:25:42,068;may never die.
324;00:25:56,017;00:25:58,451;Where are my niece
324;00:25:56,017;00:25:58,451;and nephew?
325;00:26:03,424;00:26:05,558;Let's go murder them.
326;00:26:25,613;00:26:27,813;They stole our best ships.
327;00:26:29,150;00:26:31,117;Won't be enough
327;00:26:29,150;00:26:31,117;to save them.
328;00:26:32,920;00:26:35,054;Go back to your homes.
329;00:26:35,156;00:26:37,523;Chop down every tree
329;00:26:35,156;00:26:37,523;you can find.
330;00:26:37,625;00:26:40,192;Quarter-saw the timber
330;00:26:37,625;00:26:40,192;and start building.
331;00:26:40,294;00:26:42,361;I want every man
331;00:26:40,294;00:26:42,361;bending planks.
332;00:26:42,463;00:26:45,965;I want every woman
332;00:26:42,463;00:26:45,965;spinning flax for sails.
333;00:26:46,067;00:26:48,367;Build me
333;00:26:46,067;00:26:48,367;a thousand ships
334;00:26:48,469;00:26:50,936;and I will give you
334;00:26:48,469;00:26:50,936;this world.
335;00:27:10,091;00:27:12,858;I banished you twice.
336;00:27:14,228;00:27:17,129;You came back twice.
337;00:27:20,468;00:27:22,368;And you saved my life.
338;00:27:27,008;00:27:29,008;So I can't take you back
339;00:27:29,110;00:27:31,210;and I can't send you away.
340;00:27:33,714;00:27:35,681;You must
340;00:27:33,714;00:27:35,681;send me away.
341;00:27:48,729;00:27:50,462;Is there a cure?
342;00:27:50,565;00:27:52,865;I don't know.
343;00:27:53,868;00:27:55,834;How long does it take?
344;00:27:55,937;00:27:58,437;I don't know
344;00:27:55,937;00:27:58,437;that either.
345;00:27:58,539;00:28:00,940;But I've seen what happens
345;00:27:58,539;00:28:00,940;when it goes far enough.
346;00:28:02,443;00:28:04,076;I'll end things
346;00:28:02,443;00:28:04,076;before that.
347;00:28:07,648;00:28:09,748;I'm sorry.
348;00:28:10,818;00:28:12,017;I'm so sorry.
349;00:28:12,119;00:28:14,320;Don't be.
350;00:28:14,422;00:28:16,889;All I've ever wanted
350;00:28:14,422;00:28:16,889;was to serve you.
351;00:28:20,061;00:28:22,628;Tyrion Lannister
351;00:28:20,061;00:28:22,628;was right.
352;00:28:25,299;00:28:27,866;I love you.
353;00:28:32,240;00:28:34,473;I'll always love you.
354;00:28:38,779;00:28:41,080;Good-bye, khaleesi.
355;00:28:46,420;00:28:48,754;Do not walk away
355;00:28:46,420;00:28:48,754;from your queen,
356;00:28:48,856;00:28:50,923;Jorah the Andal.
357;00:28:53,027;00:28:55,327;You have not been
357;00:28:53,027;00:28:55,327;dismissed.
358;00:28:56,697;00:28:59,064;You pledged
358;00:28:56,697;00:28:59,064;yourself to me.
359;00:28:59,166;00:29:02,468;You swore to obey my commands
359;00:28:59,166;00:29:02,468;for the rest of your life.
360;00:29:04,538;00:29:08,107;Well, I command you
360;00:29:04,538;00:29:08,107;to find the cure
361;00:29:08,209;00:29:10,743;wherever it is
361;00:29:08,209;00:29:10,743;in this world.
362;00:29:13,147;00:29:15,814;I command you
362;00:29:13,147;00:29:15,814;to heal yourself
363;00:29:15,916;00:29:18,784;and then return to me.
364;00:29:21,889;00:29:24,623;When I take
364;00:29:21,889;00:29:24,623;the Seven Kingdoms,
365;00:29:24,725;00:29:27,192;I need you by my side.
366;00:30:06,000;00:30:09,568;In the last fortnight since
366;00:30:06,000;00:30:09,568;our pact with the Masters,
367;00:30:09,670;00:30:12,971;how many killings have been carried out
367;00:30:09,670;00:30:12,971;by the Sons of the Harpy?
368;00:30:13,074;00:30:14,640;None.
369;00:30:14,742;00:30:17,676;And how many Masters
369;00:30:14,742;00:30:17,676;have been butchered by the free men?
370;00:30:17,778;00:30:20,346;Two, but that was
370;00:30:17,778;00:30:20,346;the day of the pact.
371;00:30:20,448;00:30:22,181;Since then, nothing.
372;00:30:22,283;00:30:25,284;So it's safe to say
372;00:30:22,283;00:30:25,284;that a fragile peace has taken hold.
373;00:30:25,386;00:30:26,752;For now.
374;00:30:26,854;00:30:28,754;For now is the best we get
374;00:30:26,854;00:30:28,754;in our profession.
375;00:30:28,856;00:30:30,356;It's not enough.
376;00:30:30,458;00:30:32,257;Considering the city
376;00:30:30,458;00:30:32,257;was on the brink of civil war,
377;00:30:32,360;00:30:33,859;I'd say
377;00:30:32,360;00:30:33,859;it's a good start.
378;00:30:33,961;00:30:36,528;It's not enough
378;00:30:33,961;00:30:36,528;for Meereen to have peace.
379;00:30:36,630;00:30:39,098;They need to know Daenerys
379;00:30:36,630;00:30:39,098;is responsible for it.
380;00:30:39,200;00:30:41,967;The Sons of the Harpy
380;00:30:39,200;00:30:41,967;have a good story.
381;00:30:42,069;00:30:44,236;Resist the foreign invaders.
382;00:30:44,338;00:30:46,438;Our queen has
382;00:30:44,338;00:30:46,438;an even better story.
383;00:30:46,540;00:30:51,210;Mother of Dragons,
383;00:30:46,540;00:30:51,210;Breaker of Chains and all that.
384;00:30:51,312;00:30:53,679;The people know
384;00:30:51,312;00:30:53,679;who brought them freedom.
385;00:30:53,781;00:30:56,248;Yes, but do they know
385;00:30:53,781;00:30:56,248;who brought them security?
386;00:30:56,350;00:30:58,384;Who brought about
386;00:30:56,350;00:30:58,384;an end to the violence?
387;00:30:58,486;00:31:01,086;We need someone
387;00:30:58,486;00:31:01,086;the people trust,
388;00:31:01,188;00:31:04,590;someone they know cannot
388;00:31:01,188;00:31:04,590;be bought or influenced.
389;00:31:04,692;00:31:07,826;Sounds like quite the hero.
389;00:31:04,692;00:31:07,826;Where would we find him?
390;00:31:07,928;00:31:10,195;Who said anything
390;00:31:07,928;00:31:10,195;about him?
391;00:31:36,924;00:31:39,892;That's about the extent
391;00:31:36,924;00:31:39,892;of my Valyrian.
392;00:31:45,666;00:31:48,467;Thank you
392;00:31:45,666;00:31:48,467;for travelling all this way.
393;00:31:48,569;00:31:52,404;I know from personal experience
393;00:31:48,569;00:31:52,404;how uncomfortable the journey can be.
394;00:31:57,011;00:32:00,145;The truth is
394;00:31:57,011;00:32:00,145;we need your help.
395;00:32:00,247;00:32:03,348;We had hoped that we could
395;00:32:00,247;00:32:03,348;somehow persuade you to--
396;00:32:03,451;00:32:05,684;You don't need
396;00:32:03,451;00:32:05,684;to persuade me.
397;00:32:05,786;00:32:07,586;I came to help.
398;00:32:07,688;00:32:10,856;Daenerys Stormborn
398;00:32:07,688;00:32:10,856;is the one who was promised.
399;00:32:10,958;00:32:14,827;From the fire she was reborn
399;00:32:10,958;00:32:14,827;to remake the world.
400;00:32:14,929;00:32:16,929;Yes.
401;00:32:17,031;00:32:18,897;She has freed the slaves
401;00:32:17,031;00:32:18,897;from their chains
402;00:32:18,999;00:32:22,534;and crucified the Masters
402;00:32:18,999;00:32:22,534;for their sins.
403;00:32:22,636;00:32:24,403;She did indeed.
404;00:32:24,505;00:32:27,372;Her dragons
404;00:32:24,505;00:32:27,372;are fire made flesh,
405;00:32:27,475;00:32:29,308;a gift from
405;00:32:27,475;00:32:29,308;the Lord of Light.
406;00:32:29,410;00:32:32,311;But you heard
406;00:32:29,410;00:32:32,311;all of this before, haven't you?
407;00:32:32,413;00:32:34,780;On the Long Bridge
407;00:32:32,413;00:32:34,780;of Volantis.
408;00:32:37,051;00:32:40,452;The dragons will
408;00:32:37,051;00:32:40,452;purify nonbelievers by the thousands,
409;00:32:40,554;00:32:42,921;burning their sins
409;00:32:40,554;00:32:42,921;and flesh away.
410;00:32:43,023;00:32:47,726;Ideally we'd avoid
410;00:32:43,023;00:32:47,726;purifying too many nonbelievers.
411;00:32:47,828;00:32:50,829;The Mother of Dragons
411;00:32:47,828;00:32:50,829;has followers of many different faiths.
412;00:32:50,931;00:32:54,099;You want your queen
412;00:32:50,931;00:32:54,099;to be worshipped and obeyed.
413;00:32:54,201;00:32:57,002;And while she's gone,
413;00:32:54,201;00:32:57,002;you want her advisors
414;00:32:57,104;00:32:58,770;to be worshipped
414;00:32:57,104;00:32:58,770;and obeyed.
415;00:32:58,873;00:33:02,107;I'd settle for obeyed.
416;00:33:02,209;00:33:05,210;I will summon
416;00:33:02,209;00:33:05,210;my most eloquent priests.
417;00:33:05,312;00:33:07,913;They will spread the word.
418;00:33:08,015;00:33:11,617;Daenerys has been sent
418;00:33:08,015;00:33:11,617;to lead the people against the darkness
419;00:33:11,719;00:33:15,821;in this war
419;00:33:11,719;00:33:15,821;and in the great war still to come.
420;00:33:15,923;00:33:17,389;That sounds
420;00:33:15,923;00:33:17,389;most excellent.
421;00:33:17,491;00:33:20,459;A man named
421;00:33:17,491;00:33:20,459;Stannis Baratheon was anointed
422;00:33:20,561;00:33:23,328;as the chosen one
422;00:33:20,561;00:33:23,328;by one of your priestesses.
423;00:33:23,430;00:33:26,265;He, too,
423;00:33:23,430;00:33:26,265;had a glorious destiny.
424;00:33:26,367;00:33:29,535;He attacked King's Landing
424;00:33:26,367;00:33:29,535;and was soundly defeated
425;00:33:29,637;00:33:31,737;by the man
425;00:33:29,637;00:33:31,737;standing beside me.
426;00:33:31,839;00:33:34,306;Last I had heard,
426;00:33:31,839;00:33:34,306;he had been defeated again,
427;00:33:34,408;00:33:38,577;this time at Winterfell
427;00:33:34,408;00:33:38,577;and this time for good.
428;00:33:38,679;00:33:41,780;We'd be most grateful for any support
428;00:33:38,679;00:33:41,780;you could provide the queen.
429;00:33:41,882;00:33:44,983;I suppose it's hard
429;00:33:41,882;00:33:44,983;for a fanatic to admit a mistake.
430;00:33:45,085;00:33:48,620;Isn't that the whole point
430;00:33:45,085;00:33:48,620;of being a fanatic?
431;00:33:48,722;00:33:50,889;You're always right.
432;00:33:50,991;00:33:53,592;Everything
432;00:33:50,991;00:33:53,592;is the Lord's will.
433;00:33:53,694;00:33:57,362;Everything is
433;00:33:53,694;00:33:57,362;the Lord's will.
434;00:33:57,464;00:34:00,232;But men and women
434;00:33:57,464;00:34:00,232;make mistakes.
435;00:34:00,334;00:34:02,267;Even honest servants
435;00:34:00,334;00:34:02,267;of the Lord.
436;00:34:02,369;00:34:06,305;And you,
436;00:34:02,369;00:34:06,305;an honest servant of the Lord,
437;00:34:06,407;00:34:08,907;why should I trust you
437;00:34:06,407;00:34:08,907;to know any more
438;00:34:09,009;00:34:10,876;than the priestess
438;00:34:09,009;00:34:10,876;who counseled Stannis?
439;00:34:10,978;00:34:13,946;My friend has a healthy
439;00:34:10,978;00:34:13,946;skepticism of religion,
440;00:34:14,048;00:34:16,782;but we are all loyal
440;00:34:14,048;00:34:16,782;supporters of the queen.
441;00:34:21,956;00:34:23,889;Everyone
441;00:34:21,956;00:34:23,889;is what they are
442;00:34:23,991;00:34:27,693;and where they are
442;00:34:23,991;00:34:27,693;for a reason.
443;00:34:27,795;00:34:30,963;Terrible things
443;00:34:27,795;00:34:30,963;happen for a reason.
444;00:34:31,065;00:34:34,733;Take what happened to you, Lord Varys,
444;00:34:31,065;00:34:34,733;when you were a child.
445;00:34:36,437;00:34:38,170;If not for your mutilation
446;00:34:38,272;00:34:40,172;at the hand of
446;00:34:38,272;00:34:40,172;a second-rate sorcerer,
447;00:34:40,274;00:34:43,508;you wouldn't be here
447;00:34:40,274;00:34:43,508;helping the Lord's Chosen
448;00:34:43,611;00:34:46,712;bring his light
448;00:34:43,611;00:34:46,712;into the world.
449;00:34:46,814;00:34:50,048;Knowledge has made
449;00:34:46,814;00:34:50,048;you powerful.
450;00:34:50,150;00:34:53,251;But there's still
450;00:34:50,150;00:34:53,251;so much you don't know.
451;00:34:55,389;00:34:58,357;Do you remember
451;00:34:55,389;00:34:58,357;what you heard that night
452;00:34:58,459;00:35:01,994;when the sorcerer tossed
452;00:34:58,459;00:35:01,994;your parts in the fire?
453;00:35:04,098;00:35:06,422;You heard a voice
453;00:35:04,098;00:35:06,422;call out from the flames.
454;00:35:06,446;00:35:08,070;Do you remember?
455;00:35:10,204;00:35:14,006;Should I tell you
455;00:35:10,204;00:35:14,006;what the voice said?
456;00:35:14,108;00:35:17,676;Should I tell you
456;00:35:14,108;00:35:17,676;the name of the one who spoke?
457;00:35:27,321;00:35:29,488;We serve the same queen.
458;00:35:29,590;00:35:31,623;If you are
458;00:35:29,590;00:35:31,623;her true friend,
459;00:35:31,725;00:35:34,359;you have nothing
459;00:35:31,725;00:35:34,359;to fear from me.
460;00:37:24,304;00:37:25,837;What?
461;00:39:09,610;00:39:11,610;He saw me,
461;00:39:09,610;00:39:11,610;the Night King!
462;00:39:11,712;00:39:13,879;He saw me!
462;00:39:11,712;00:39:13,879;He touched you.
463;00:39:15,415;00:39:17,549;I don't know.
463;00:39:15,415;00:39:17,549;He was close, but--
464;00:39:17,651;00:39:18,651;He touched you.
465;00:39:21,955;00:39:23,989;He knows you are here.
465;00:39:21,955;00:39:23,989;He'll come for you.
466;00:39:24,091;00:39:25,490;But he can't get in.
467;00:39:25,592;00:39:29,127;He can now.
467;00:39:25,592;00:39:29,127;His mark is on you.
468;00:39:29,229;00:39:31,196;You must leave,
468;00:39:29,229;00:39:31,196;all of you.
469;00:39:35,235;00:39:37,168;Come on, Hodor.
469;00:39:35,235;00:39:37,168;Help me with the sledge.
470;00:39:37,271;00:39:39,070;Hodor.
471;00:39:39,172;00:39:41,139;I'm sorry.
471;00:39:39,172;00:39:41,139;I didn't mean to.
472;00:39:41,241;00:39:44,142;The time has come.
472;00:39:41,241;00:39:44,142;The time for what?
473;00:39:44,244;00:39:47,279;For you to become me.
474;00:39:47,381;00:39:51,483;But am I ready?
475;00:39:51,585;00:39:53,485;No.
476;00:39:55,422;00:39:58,156;We can't defend the north
476;00:39:55,422;00:39:58,156;from the walkers
477;00:39:58,258;00:39:59,991;and the south
477;00:39:58,258;00:39:59,991;from the Boltons.
478;00:40:00,093;00:40:02,027;If we want to survive,
478;00:40:00,093;00:40:02,027;we need Winterfell
479;00:40:02,129;00:40:04,930;and to take Winterfell,
479;00:40:02,129;00:40:04,930;we need more men.
480;00:40:08,135;00:40:10,802;Aside from the Starks
480;00:40:08,135;00:40:10,802;and the Boltons,
481;00:40:10,904;00:40:13,605;the most powerful
481;00:40:10,904;00:40:13,605;houses in the North
482;00:40:13,707;00:40:15,740;are the Umbers,
482;00:40:13,707;00:40:15,740;the Karstarks,
483;00:40:15,842;00:40:17,475;and the Manderlys.
484;00:40:17,577;00:40:20,278;The Umbers
484;00:40:17,577;00:40:20,278;and the Karstarks
485;00:40:20,380;00:40:22,314;have already declared
485;00:40:20,380;00:40:22,314;for the Boltons,
486;00:40:22,416;00:40:24,049;so we're not doing
486;00:40:22,416;00:40:24,049;so well there.
487;00:40:24,151;00:40:26,785;The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies.
487;00:40:24,151;00:40:26,785;They can hang.
488;00:40:26,887;00:40:29,120;But the Karstarks
488;00:40:26,887;00:40:29,120;declared for Ramsay
489;00:40:29,222;00:40:31,723;without knowing
489;00:40:29,222;00:40:31,723;they had another choice.
490;00:40:31,825;00:40:34,159;I beg your pardon,
490;00:40:31,825;00:40:34,159;my lady,
491;00:40:34,261;00:40:37,395;but they know that a Stark
491;00:40:34,261;00:40:37,395;beheaded their father.
492;00:40:37,497;00:40:39,531;I don't think we can
492;00:40:37,497;00:40:39,531;count on them either.
493;00:40:41,201;00:40:43,902;How well do you know
493;00:40:41,201;00:40:43,902;the North, Ser Davos?
494;00:40:44,004;00:40:45,370;Precious little, my lady.
495;00:40:45,472;00:40:47,605;My father always said
495;00:40:45,472;00:40:47,605;Northerners are different.
496;00:40:47,708;00:40:51,409;More loyal,
496;00:40:47,708;00:40:51,409;more suspicious of outsiders.
497;00:40:51,511;00:40:53,078;They may well be loyal,
498;00:40:53,180;00:40:55,146;but how many rose up
498;00:40:53,180;00:40:55,146;against the Boltons
499;00:40:55,248;00:40:57,015;when they betrayed
499;00:40:55,248;00:40:57,015;your family?
500;00:40:59,353;00:41:01,953;I may not know the North,
500;00:40:59,353;00:41:01,953;but I know men.
501;00:41:02,055;00:41:04,556;They're more or less
501;00:41:02,055;00:41:04,556;the same in any corner of the world
502;00:41:04,658;00:41:07,559;and even the bravest of them
502;00:41:04,658;00:41:07,559;don't want to see
503;00:41:07,661;00:41:10,962;their wives and children
503;00:41:07,661;00:41:10,962;skinned for a lost cause.
504;00:41:11,064;00:41:14,399;If Jon's going to convince them
504;00:41:11,064;00:41:14,399;to fight alongside him,
505;00:41:14,501;00:41:16,468;they need to believe
505;00:41:14,501;00:41:16,468;it's a fight they can win.
506;00:41:16,570;00:41:19,137;There are more than three
506;00:41:16,570;00:41:19,137;other houses in the North--
507;00:41:19,239;00:41:21,873;Glover, Mormont,
507;00:41:19,239;00:41:21,873;Cerwyn,
508;00:41:21,975;00:41:23,575;Mazin, Hornwood.
509;00:41:23,677;00:41:27,278;Two dozen more.
509;00:41:23,677;00:41:27,278;Together they equal all the others.
510;00:41:27,381;00:41:29,347;We can start small
510;00:41:27,381;00:41:29,347;and build.
511;00:41:29,449;00:41:31,883;The North remembers.
512;00:41:31,985;00:41:33,451;They remember
512;00:41:31,985;00:41:33,451;the Stark name.
513;00:41:33,553;00:41:35,453;People will still risk
513;00:41:33,553;00:41:35,453;everything for it,
514;00:41:35,555;00:41:37,756;from White Harbor
514;00:41:35,555;00:41:37,756;to Ramsay's own door.
515;00:41:37,858;00:41:40,058;I don't doubt it.
516;00:41:40,160;00:41:42,260;But Jon doesn't have
516;00:41:40,160;00:41:42,260;the Stark name.
517;00:41:42,362;00:41:44,429;No, but I do.
518;00:41:47,334;00:41:49,968;Jon is every bit
518;00:41:47,334;00:41:49,968;as much Ned Stark's son
519;00:41:50,070;00:41:51,870;as Ramsay
519;00:41:50,070;00:41:51,870;is Roose Bolton's.
520;00:41:51,972;00:41:54,012;And there are also the Tullys.
520;00:41:51,972;00:41:54,012;They're not Northern,
521;00:41:54,107;00:41:57,075;but they will back us against
521;00:41:54,107;00:41:57,075;the Boltons without question.
522;00:41:57,177;00:41:58,710;I didn't know the Tullys
522;00:41:57,177;00:41:58,710;still had an army.
523;00:41:58,812;00:42:00,745;My uncle the Blackfish
523;00:41:58,812;00:42:00,745;has reformed it
524;00:42:00,847;00:42:02,080;and retaken Riverrun.
525;00:42:02,182;00:42:04,249;How do you know that?
526;00:42:05,619;00:42:08,620;Ramsay received a raven
526;00:42:05,619;00:42:08,620;before I escaped Winterfell.
527;00:42:10,657;00:42:12,390;That's good.
528;00:42:12,492;00:42:14,492;The Blackfish
528;00:42:12,492;00:42:14,492;is a legend.
529;00:42:14,594;00:42:16,995;His support would mean
529;00:42:14,594;00:42:16,995;a great deal.
530;00:42:17,097;00:42:20,098;Stark, Tully,
530;00:42:17,097;00:42:20,098;a few more houses,
531;00:42:20,200;00:42:22,434;almost starts to look
531;00:42:20,200;00:42:22,434;like a winning side.
532;00:42:24,838;00:42:26,905;I've sworn
532;00:42:24,838;00:42:26,905;to protect you, my lady.
533;00:42:27,007;00:42:28,773;You heard them.
533;00:42:27,007;00:42:28,773;We need more men
534;00:42:28,875;00:42:30,675;and my uncle
534;00:42:28,875;00:42:30,675;has an army.
535;00:42:30,777;00:42:32,310;We can send
535;00:42:30,777;00:42:32,310;the Blackfish a raven.
536;00:42:32,412;00:42:34,446;Can't risk Ramsay
536;00:42:32,412;00:42:34,446;intercepting it.
537;00:42:34,548;00:42:36,214;It has to be you.
538;00:42:36,316;00:42:38,583;Ride for Riverrun.
538;00:42:36,316;00:42:38,583;My uncle will talk to you
539;00:42:38,685;00:42:40,485;and you'll know
539;00:42:38,685;00:42:40,485;how to talk to him.
540;00:42:42,823;00:42:44,255;What is it?
541;00:42:46,059;00:42:48,093;I don't like leaving
541;00:42:46,059;00:42:48,093;you here alone.
542;00:42:48,195;00:42:49,494;With Jon?
543;00:42:49,596;00:42:52,363;Not him.
543;00:42:49,596;00:42:52,363;He seems trustworthy.
544;00:42:52,466;00:42:54,466;A bit brooding, perhaps.
545;00:42:54,568;00:42:56,634;I suppose that's
545;00:42:54,568;00:42:56,634;understandable, considering.
546;00:42:58,371;00:43:00,238;The others, though.
547;00:43:02,409;00:43:06,044;Davos and the Red Woman
547;00:43:02,409;00:43:06,044;helped a man murder his own brother
548;00:43:06,146;00:43:07,745;with bloodmagic.
549;00:43:07,848;00:43:10,448;And when Stannis paid for his crime,
549;00:43:07,848;00:43:10,448;where were they?
550;00:43:10,550;00:43:14,752;Already out looking
550;00:43:10,550;00:43:14,752;for a leader with better prospects.
551;00:43:14,855;00:43:17,288;And that wildling fellow
551;00:43:14,855;00:43:17,288;with the beard--
552;00:43:17,390;00:43:20,625;Jon isn't Tormund.
552;00:43:17,390;00:43:20,625;Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman
553;00:43:20,727;00:43:23,728;or Stannis for that matter.
553;00:43:20,727;00:43:23,728;Jon is Jon.
554;00:43:23,830;00:43:27,298;He's my brother. He'll keep me safe.
554;00:43:23,830;00:43:27,298;I trust him.
555;00:43:29,769;00:43:33,705;Then why did you lie to him when he asked
555;00:43:29,769;00:43:33,705;you how you learned about Riverrun?
556;00:43:42,916;00:43:44,582;New dress?
557;00:43:44,684;00:43:47,418;I made it myself.
557;00:43:44,684;00:43:47,418;Do you like it?
558;00:43:47,521;00:43:51,523;Yeah, it's--
558;00:43:47,521;00:43:51,523;I like the wolf bit.
559;00:43:51,625;00:43:55,727;Good, because I made
559;00:43:51,625;00:43:55,727;this for you.
560;00:43:58,431;00:44:00,732;I made it like the one
560;00:43:58,431;00:44:00,732;Father used to wear.
561;00:44:00,834;00:44:03,735;As near
561;00:44:00,834;00:44:03,735;as I can remember.
562;00:44:05,505;00:44:07,205;Thank you, Sansa.
563;00:44:07,307;00:44:08,973;You're welcome.
564;00:44:29,196;00:44:31,629;Don't knock it down
564;00:44:29,196;00:44:31,629;while I'm gone.
565;00:44:31,731;00:44:33,665;I'll do my best.
566;00:44:39,072;00:44:41,206;Good luck.
567;00:45:12,339;00:45:14,872;Should we close the gate,
567;00:45:12,339;00:45:14,872;Lord Commander?
568;00:45:14,975;00:45:17,075;I'm not
568;00:45:14,975;00:45:17,075;the Lord Comman--
569;00:45:21,548;00:45:25,783;yeah, ahem,
569;00:45:21,548;00:45:25,783;close the bloody gate.
570;00:45:37,764;00:45:39,530;We can go home now, Hodor.
571;00:45:39,633;00:45:42,200;Well, maybe not
571;00:45:39,633;00:45:42,200;home home,
572;00:45:42,302;00:45:44,502;but somewhere
572;00:45:42,302;00:45:44,502;that isn't a cave.
573;00:45:44,604;00:45:46,004;Hodor.
574;00:45:46,106;00:45:48,139;Eat something
574;00:45:46,106;00:45:48,139;that isn't moss.
575;00:45:50,377;00:45:52,677;I want an egg.
575;00:45:50,377;00:45:52,677;How do you like 'em?
576;00:45:52,779;00:45:55,713;Boiled? Fried up
576;00:45:52,779;00:45:55,713;with some butter?
577;00:45:55,815;00:45:57,415;Hodor.
578;00:45:57,517;00:46:01,085;With a rasher of bacon
578;00:45:57,517;00:46:01,085;and some blood sausage.

580;00:47:02,449;00:47:04,649;Get Bran and run!
