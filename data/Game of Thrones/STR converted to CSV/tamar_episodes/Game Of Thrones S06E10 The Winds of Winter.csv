1;00:04:19,100;00:04:20,466;Your Grace.
2;00:04:20,568;00:04:24,203;The trial will be
2;00:04:20,568;00:04:24,203;getting under way soon.
3;00:04:56,721;00:04:58,120;You got my money?
4;00:04:58,222;00:05:00,522;Later. Go away.
5;00:05:11,254;00:05:13,088;Grand Maester.
6;00:05:53,496;00:05:55,964;Ser Loras Tyrell.
7;00:05:57,801;00:06:00,534;Are you prepared to stand trial
8;00:06:00,637;00:06:04,338;and profess your guilt or
8;00:06:00,637;00:06:04,338;innocence before the Seven?
9;00:06:06,943;00:06:09,343;There'll be no need for a trial.
10;00:06:11,848;00:06:14,249;I confess before the Seven
11;00:06:14,350;00:06:16,350;and freely admit to my crimes.
12;00:06:17,854;00:06:20,588;To which crimes will you be confessing?
13;00:06:21,466;00:06:23,024;All of them.
14;00:06:24,761;00:06:26,460;I lay with other men
15;00:06:26,562;00:06:29,998;including the traitor Renly Baratheon.
16;00:06:33,503;00:06:36,271;I perjured myself before the gods.
17;00:06:36,372;00:06:38,673;I am guilty of depravity...
18;00:06:40,177;00:06:42,177;dishonesty,
19;00:06:42,279;00:06:43,744;profligacy,
20;00:06:43,847;00:06:46,714;and arrogance.
21;00:06:46,817;00:06:48,249;I see that now.
22;00:06:50,620;00:06:52,854;I humble myself before the Seven
23;00:06:52,956;00:06:56,357;and accept whatever punishment
23;00:06:52,956;00:06:56,357;the gods deem just.
24;00:06:58,394;00:07:03,264;The gods' judgment is fierce,
25;00:07:03,366;00:07:05,900;but also fair.
26;00:07:06,002;00:07:09,370;The Warrior punishes those
26;00:07:06,002;00:07:09,370;who believe themselves
27;00:07:09,472;00:07:11,739;beyond the reach of justice.
28;00:07:13,243;00:07:16,311;But the Mother shows her mercy
29;00:07:16,412;00:07:20,215;to those who kneel before her.
30;00:07:28,258;00:07:30,959;I take full responsibility
30;00:07:28,258;00:07:30,959;for my many sins
31;00:07:31,061;00:07:33,561;and unburden myself of my desires.
32;00:07:37,033;00:07:39,968;My only remaining wish
33;00:07:40,070;00:07:42,670;is to devote my life to the Seven.
34;00:07:43,471;00:07:45,840;May I be a living example of their grace
35;00:07:45,942;00:07:48,609;for others to witness.
36;00:07:50,180;00:07:53,647;You understand fully
37;00:07:53,750;00:07:55,583;what this means?
38;00:07:56,031;00:07:57,185;I do.
39;00:07:59,756;00:08:01,890;I will abandon the Tyrell name
40;00:08:01,992;00:08:05,026;and all that goes with it.
41;00:08:05,128;00:08:08,897;I will renounce my lordship
41;00:08:05,128;00:08:08,897;and my claims on Highgarden.
42;00:08:12,535;00:08:14,769;I will never marry
43;00:08:14,871;00:08:17,272;and I will never father children.
44;00:08:21,700;00:08:22,810;Brother Loras...
45;00:08:24,237;00:08:27,681;...I ask you to dedicate
45;00:08:24,237;00:08:27,681;your life to the seven gods.
46;00:08:31,922;00:08:34,722;Will you fight to defend your faith
47;00:08:34,824;00:08:37,258;against heretics and apostates?
48;00:08:37,360;00:08:38,859;I will.
49;00:09:08,058;00:09:09,223;No, I can't let them...
50;00:09:09,326;00:09:12,293;Faith is the way, Father.
51;00:09:34,851;00:09:36,017;All right.
52;00:09:37,253;00:09:38,953;I'm ready.
53;00:09:46,396;00:09:48,896;I have to go. I'm...
54;00:09:48,999;00:09:50,931;I'm late for the trial.
55;00:10:04,080;00:10:06,180;You mutilated him.
56;00:10:06,282;00:10:08,182;You gave me your word.
57;00:10:08,284;00:10:10,651;And I have kept my word.
58;00:10:10,753;00:10:13,521;Once the queen mother's
58;00:10:10,753;00:10:13,521;trial is concluded,
59;00:10:13,623;00:10:15,656;Brother Loras is free to leave.
60;00:10:15,758;00:10:17,658;And where is the queen mother?
61;00:10:17,760;00:10:21,029;Her litter never left the Red Keep.
62;00:10:21,131;00:10:25,066;It appears the queen mother doesn't
62;00:10:21,131;00:10:25,066;wish to attend her own trial.
63;00:10:27,470;00:10:30,138;Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.
64;00:10:56,999;00:10:58,766;Get the others.
65;00:11:40,810;00:11:42,743;Where's the king?
66;00:11:45,715;00:11:47,648;Elsewhere, I'm afraid.
67;00:11:47,750;00:11:49,383;What's the meaning of this?
68;00:11:49,486;00:11:51,352;I was told that...
69;00:11:53,022;00:11:55,123;I have more important
69;00:11:53,022;00:11:55,123;things to do with my time
70;00:11:55,225;00:11:56,591;than waste them in the presence...
71;00:11:56,692;00:11:59,360;Please, Grand Maester. I
71;00:11:56,692;00:11:59,360;bear you no ill will.
72;00:12:00,830;00:12:03,164;Please forgive me if you can.
73;00:12:34,930;00:12:37,064;This pains me, my lord.
74;00:12:37,167;00:12:39,233;Whatever your faults, you do not deserve
75;00:12:39,335;00:12:42,303;to die alone in such a cold, dark place.
76;00:12:42,405;00:12:46,140;But sometimes before we
76;00:12:42,405;00:12:46,140;can usher in the new,
77;00:12:46,242;00:12:50,378;the old must be put to rest.
78;00:13:31,554;00:13:34,655;The longer you wait, the
78;00:13:31,554;00:13:34,655;worse it'll be for you.
79;00:14:01,618;00:14:03,651;What are you doing?
80;00:15:11,020;00:15:13,086;There's something wrong.
81;00:15:13,189;00:15:15,656;You have nothing to fear, Your Grace.
82;00:15:15,758;00:15:17,625;The trial will begin shortly.
83;00:15:17,727;00:15:20,428;Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here.
84;00:15:20,530;00:15:21,862;Why do you think they're not here?
85;00:15:21,964;00:15:23,798;If the accused is not here,
86;00:15:23,899;00:15:25,966;she will be tried regardless.
87;00:15:26,068;00:15:28,302;We cannot escape the
87;00:15:26,068;00:15:28,302;justice of the gods...
88;00:15:28,404;00:15:31,038;Forget about the bloody gods and
88;00:15:28,404;00:15:31,038;listen to what I'm telling you!
89;00:15:31,140;00:15:34,575;Cersei understands the
89;00:15:31,140;00:15:34,575;consequences of her absence
90;00:15:34,677;00:15:36,444;and she is absent anyway,
91;00:15:36,546;00:15:40,414;which means she does not intend
91;00:15:36,546;00:15:40,414;to suffer those consequences.
92;00:15:40,516;00:15:44,385;The trial can wait.
92;00:15:40,516;00:15:44,385;We all need to leave.
93;00:16:10,179;00:16:12,279;We all need to leave now!
94;00:16:16,919;00:16:19,687;Loras.
95;00:16:19,789;00:16:21,955;Stay with me.
96;00:16:34,404;00:16:37,204;Let me through. Let me through.
97;00:16:39,074;00:16:41,375;Get out of my way.
98;00:16:49,685;00:16:51,619;Let us through.
99;00:18:21,076;00:18:23,110;Confess.
100;00:18:25,280;00:18:27,247;Confess.
101;00:18:31,587;00:18:33,587;No.
101;00:18:31,587;00:18:33,587;Confess.
102;00:18:43,198;00:18:46,033;Confess. It felt good.
103;00:18:46,135;00:18:49,837;Beating me, starving me,
104;00:18:49,939;00:18:52,840;frightening me, humiliating me.
105;00:18:55,845;00:18:59,500;You didn't do it because you
105;00:18:55,845;00:18:59,500;cared about my atonement.
106;00:18:59,501;00:19:02,658;You did it because it felt good.
107;00:19:02,659;00:19:05,023;I understand.
108;00:19:05,024;00:19:07,454;I do things because they feel good.
109;00:19:10,426;00:19:13,761;I drink because it feels good.
110;00:19:13,863;00:19:17,965;I killed my husband because it
110;00:19:13,863;00:19:17,965;felt good to be rid of him.
111;00:19:21,303;00:19:26,273;I fuck my brother because it feels
111;00:19:21,303;00:19:26,273;good to feel him inside me.
112;00:19:26,375;00:19:28,442;I lie about fucking my brother...
113;00:19:30,479;00:19:34,481;because it feels good to keep our
113;00:19:30,479;00:19:34,481;son safe from hateful hypocrites.
114;00:19:37,286;00:19:39,053;I killed your High Sparrow...
115;00:19:41,023;00:19:43,190;and all his little sparrows...
116;00:19:44,860;00:19:48,128;all his septons, all his septas,
117;00:19:48,230;00:19:51,065;all his filthy soldiers,
118;00:19:51,166;00:19:54,367;because it felt good to watch them burn.
119;00:19:56,205;00:20:00,040;It felt good to imagine
119;00:19:56,205;00:20:00,040;their shock and their pain.
120;00:20:00,142;00:20:03,477;No thought has ever
120;00:20:00,142;00:20:03,477;given me greater joy.
121;00:20:09,184;00:20:12,686;Even confessing feels good
121;00:20:09,184;00:20:12,686;under the right circumstances.
122;00:20:18,861;00:20:20,894;You've always been quiet.
123;00:20:28,871;00:20:31,839;I said my face would be the last
123;00:20:28,871;00:20:31,839;thing you saw before you died.
124;00:20:31,941;00:20:34,008;Do you remember?
125;00:20:34,110;00:20:36,076;Good.
126;00:20:38,347;00:20:40,614;I'm glad to see your face.
127;00:20:43,519;00:20:45,452;I'm ready to meet the gods.
128;00:20:45,554;00:20:46,887;What?
129;00:20:48,891;00:20:50,824;Now?
130;00:20:50,926;00:20:52,392;Today?
131;00:20:55,464;00:20:57,898;You're not going to die today.
132;00:21:00,402;00:21:02,870;You're not going to die
132;00:21:00,402;00:21:02,870;for quite a while.
133;00:21:05,307;00:21:07,274;Ser Gregor.
134;00:21:11,313;00:21:13,580;This is Ser Gregor Clegane.
135;00:21:13,683;00:21:16,283;He's quiet, too.
136;00:21:27,396;00:21:29,029;Your gods have forsaken you.
137;00:21:30,265;00:21:32,399;This is your god now.
138;00:21:43,612;00:21:45,412;No.
139;00:21:46,515;00:21:47,681;No.
140;00:21:49,218;00:21:52,452;Shame.
141;00:21:52,554;00:21:55,789;Shame.
142;00:21:55,891;00:21:59,593;Shame.
143;00:22:04,499;00:22:07,000;I'm very sorry, Your Grace.
144;00:22:08,537;00:22:10,303;Very sorry.
145;00:22:54,083;00:22:56,449;For House Lannister!
146;00:22:56,551;00:22:58,485;Hear me roar!
147;00:23:04,126;00:23:06,326;For House Frey!
148;00:23:06,428;00:23:09,496;We stand together!
149;00:23:09,598;00:23:12,465;May we stand together
149;00:23:09,598;00:23:12,465;through the centuries,
150;00:23:12,567;00:23:15,035;good friends to the last.
151;00:23:15,137;00:23:19,173;And when we drive our swords
151;00:23:15,137;00:23:19,173;through our enemies' hearts,
152;00:23:19,275;00:23:23,076;may we speak the words of our alliance,
153;00:23:23,179;00:23:26,579;The Freys and the Lannisters
154;00:23:26,682;00:23:28,882;send their regards.
155;00:23:46,202;00:23:48,702;You don't even have to
155;00:23:46,202;00:23:48,702;do anything, do you?
156;00:23:50,105;00:23:52,372;You just sit there, a rich slab of beef,
157;00:23:52,474;00:23:53,907;and all the birds come pecking.
158;00:23:54,009;00:23:56,409;You're welcome to her.
158;00:23:54,009;00:23:56,409;She doesn't want me.
159;00:23:56,511;00:23:58,912;She wants your golden
159;00:23:56,511;00:23:58,912;fingers up her twat.
160;00:24:00,782;00:24:02,883;Those two have their eyes on you.
161;00:24:05,054;00:24:06,953;They have their eyes on you, cunt.
162;00:24:07,652;00:24:08,655;Not my type.
163;00:24:08,757;00:24:10,324;Not blonde enough?
164;00:24:12,794;00:24:16,230;Ladies, have you met Ser
164;00:24:12,794;00:24:16,230;Bronn of the Blackwater,
165;00:24:16,332;00:24:18,498;hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay?
166;00:24:18,600;00:24:20,968;There you go.
166;00:24:18,600;00:24:20,968;Maybe I'm not in the mood.
167;00:24:24,804;00:24:25,874;Fuck it.
168;00:24:25,875;00:24:29,042;No need to call me ser just
168;00:24:25,875;00:24:29,042;because I'm an anointed knight.
169;00:24:34,350;00:24:36,783;This came together rather well.
170;00:24:38,520;00:24:40,687;Your father would be pleased.
171;00:24:40,789;00:24:42,455;I'm sure he would be.
172;00:24:45,094;00:24:47,928;Edmure is back in a cell.
173;00:24:48,030;00:24:51,664;Can't go killing my son by law.
173;00:24:48,030;00:24:51,664;It wouldn't be right.
174;00:24:51,767;00:24:53,934;Give the family a bad name.
175;00:24:57,406;00:25:01,341;So the famous Blackfish
175;00:24:57,406;00:25:01,341;killed by foot soldiers, eh?
176;00:25:01,443;00:25:04,344;Legendary warrior, everyone said.
177;00:25:05,814;00:25:08,115;Have you done much fighting
177;00:25:05,814;00:25:08,115;yourself, Lord Frey?
178;00:25:08,217;00:25:10,750;I'm a bit old for all that.
179;00:25:10,852;00:25:13,553;No, but back in your day.
180;00:25:13,655;00:25:16,589;The purpose of fighting
181;00:25:16,691;00:25:19,893;is defeating your enemies, isn't it?
182;00:25:19,995;00:25:21,995;I've defeated mine.
183;00:25:22,097;00:25:25,799;Riverrun belonged to House
183;00:25:22,097;00:25:25,799;Tully for a thousand years.
184;00:25:25,901;00:25:27,467;Now it's mine.
185;00:25:27,569;00:25:29,869;What do you call that?
186;00:25:29,972;00:25:31,238;Victory.
187;00:25:31,340;00:25:33,840;Yes, you're a great conqueror.
188;00:25:35,444;00:25:39,212;Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind?
189;00:25:39,315;00:25:42,049;The Tullys mocked me for years.
190;00:25:42,151;00:25:44,318;The Starks mocked me.
191;00:25:44,420;00:25:45,885;Where are they now?
192;00:25:45,988;00:25:48,455;You talk about war as
192;00:25:45,988;00:25:48,455;if you're an expert,
193;00:25:48,557;00:25:50,857;but the one battle I
193;00:25:48,557;00:25:50,857;remember you fighting,
194;00:25:50,960;00:25:53,860;you were captured by Robb
194;00:25:50,960;00:25:53,860;Stark, the Young Wolf.
195;00:25:53,963;00:25:56,863;But it doesn't matter.
196;00:25:56,966;00:26:00,300;Here we are now, two kingslayers.
197;00:26:00,402;00:26:04,271;We know what it's like to
197;00:26:00,402;00:26:04,271;have them grovel to our faces
198;00:26:04,373;00:26:07,374;and snigger behind our backs.
199;00:26:07,476;00:26:09,042;We don't mind, do we?
200;00:26:09,144;00:26:13,113;Fear is a marvelous thing.
201;00:26:13,215;00:26:14,814;They don't fear the Freys, though.
202;00:26:14,916;00:26:17,650;They fear the Lannisters.
203;00:26:17,752;00:26:20,120;We gave you the Riverlands
203;00:26:17,752;00:26:20,120;to hold the Riverlands.
204;00:26:20,222;00:26:22,655;If we have to ride north
204;00:26:20,222;00:26:22,655;and take them back for you
205;00:26:22,757;00:26:25,158;every time you lose them,
206;00:26:25,260;00:26:27,227;why do we need you?
207;00:26:48,917;00:26:50,583;Show me.
208;00:26:53,389;00:26:55,355;Your Grace, there's no need...
209;00:26:55,457;00:26:56,823;Show me.
210;00:27:09,738;00:27:13,140;What are your thoughts
210;00:27:09,738;00:27:13,140;concerning the king's funeral?
211;00:27:13,242;00:27:15,909;As the Sept of Baelor
211;00:27:13,242;00:27:15,909;is no longer an option,
212;00:27:16,011;00:27:19,779;perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?
213;00:27:21,250;00:27:24,384;He should be with his grandfather,
214;00:27:24,486;00:27:27,320;his brother, his sister.
215;00:27:29,758;00:27:32,426;Burn him
216;00:27:32,528;00:27:35,495;and bury his ashes where
216;00:27:32,528;00:27:35,495;the sept once stood.
217;00:28:33,222;00:28:34,588;Hello.
218;00:28:41,363;00:28:45,064;From Lord Commander
218;00:28:41,363;00:28:45,064;Snow at Castle Black.
219;00:28:59,681;00:29:01,948;I'm...
220;00:29:02,050;00:29:03,550;I'm to be the new maester.
221;00:29:21,383;00:29:22,536;According to our records,
222;00:29:22,638;00:29:24,404;Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.
223;00:29:25,807;00:29:27,541;He died.
224;00:29:27,643;00:29:30,210;We received no report from
224;00:29:27,643;00:29:30,210;the maester at Castle Black.
225;00:29:30,312;00:29:33,446;Maester Aemon became quite ill
225;00:29:30,312;00:29:33,446;shortly after the election.
226;00:29:34,307;00:29:35,815;He's since passed away.
227;00:29:35,816;00:29:38,018;Jon Snow will go to
227;00:29:35,816;00:29:38,018;T|U|S|U|B|T|I|T|U|L|O|.
228;00:29:38,019;00:29:39,952;Which is why I'm here.
229;00:29:43,325;00:29:45,158;This is irregular.
230;00:29:45,260;00:29:47,294;Yes, well...
231;00:29:47,295;00:29:50,264;I suppose that life is irregular.
232;00:30:01,510;00:30:05,612;The archmaester will discuss
232;00:30:01,510;00:30:05,612;these irregularities with you.
233;00:30:08,183;00:30:11,218;In the meantime, you are
233;00:30:08,183;00:30:11,218;permitted to use the library.
234;00:30:11,320;00:30:13,186;Follow me.
235;00:30:16,157;00:30:18,157;No women or children.
236;00:32:12,407;00:32:14,708;When we had feasts,
237;00:32:14,810;00:32:17,076;our family would sit up here...
238;00:32:19,080;00:32:20,980;and I'd sit down there.
239;00:32:23,318;00:32:25,885;Could have been worse, Jon Snow.
240;00:32:25,987;00:32:27,754;You had a family.
241;00:32:27,856;00:32:29,021;You had feasts.
242;00:32:31,192;00:32:34,327;Aye, you're right. I
242;00:32:31,192;00:32:34,327;was luckier than most.
243;00:32:49,778;00:32:51,444;What is that?
244;00:32:53,081;00:32:55,014;Tell him.
245;00:32:58,052;00:33:00,253;Tell him who it belonged to.
246;00:33:05,126;00:33:06,726;The Princess Shireen.
247;00:33:06,828;00:33:09,128;Tell him what you did to her.
248;00:33:11,516;00:33:12,598;Tell him!
249;00:33:19,007;00:33:20,707;We burned her at the stake.
250;00:33:33,855;00:33:36,188;Why?
251;00:33:36,291;00:33:39,392;The army was trapped.
251;00:33:36,291;00:33:39,392;The horses were dying.
252;00:33:39,494;00:33:42,562;It was the only way.
252;00:33:39,494;00:33:42,562;You burned a little girl alive!
253;00:33:42,664;00:33:44,096;I only do what my Lord commands.
254;00:33:44,198;00:33:47,333;If he commands you to burn
254;00:33:44,198;00:33:47,333;children, your Lord is evil.
255;00:33:50,639;00:33:52,338;We are standing here because of him.
256;00:33:53,842;00:33:57,109;Jon Snow is alive because
256;00:33:53,842;00:33:57,109;the Lord willed it.
257;00:33:57,211;00:34:00,814;I loved that girl like she was my own.
258;00:34:00,916;00:34:04,216;She was good. She was kind.
258;00:34:00,916;00:34:04,216;And you killed her!
259;00:34:06,421;00:34:07,887;So did her father.
260;00:34:10,191;00:34:11,658;So did her mother.
261;00:34:13,862;00:34:16,095;Her own blood knew it was the only way.
262;00:34:16,197;00:34:18,798;The only way for what?
263;00:34:18,900;00:34:20,599;They all died anyway.
264;00:34:22,270;00:34:24,270;You told everyone Stannis was the one.
265;00:34:24,372;00:34:26,706;You had him believing
265;00:34:24,372;00:34:26,706;it, all of them fooled.
266;00:34:26,808;00:34:29,275;And you lied.
266;00:34:26,808;00:34:29,275;I didn't lie.
267;00:34:31,012;00:34:32,345;I was wrong.
268;00:34:32,447;00:34:35,682;Aye, you were wrong.
269;00:34:36,510;00:34:39,418;How many died because you were wrong?
270;00:34:44,392;00:34:48,294;I ask your leave to execute
270;00:34:44,392;00:34:48,294;this woman for murder.
271;00:34:48,396;00:34:50,196;She admits to the crime.
272;00:34:52,701;00:34:55,101;Do you have anything
272;00:34:52,701;00:34:55,101;to say for yourself?
273;00:34:56,972;00:34:59,706;I've been ready to die for many years.
274;00:35:01,510;00:35:04,544;If the Lord was done with
274;00:35:01,510;00:35:04,544;me, so be it, but he's not.
275;00:35:04,646;00:35:07,847;You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow.
276;00:35:07,949;00:35:11,217;You know the great war is still to come.
277;00:35:11,319;00:35:14,286;You know the army of the
277;00:35:11,319;00:35:14,286;dead will be upon us soon.
278;00:35:15,524;00:35:18,090;And you know I can
278;00:35:15,524;00:35:18,090;help you win that war.
279;00:35:32,373;00:35:34,240;Ride south today.
280;00:35:35,744;00:35:37,644;If you return to the North,
281;00:35:37,746;00:35:40,346;I'll have you hanged as a murderer.
282;00:35:58,099;00:36:00,700;If you ever come back this way,
283;00:36:00,802;00:36:03,169;I will execute you myself.
284;00:36:35,169;00:36:37,971;I'm having the lord's
284;00:36:35,169;00:36:37,971;chamber prepared for you.
285;00:36:39,708;00:36:41,741;Mother and Father's room?
286;00:36:43,211;00:36:45,044;You should take it.
287;00:36:46,447;00:36:48,414;I'm not a Stark.
288;00:36:49,325;00:36:50,917;You are to me.
289;00:36:54,589;00:36:56,255;You're the Lady of Winterfell.
290;00:36:56,357;00:37:00,259;You deserve it. We're
290;00:36:56,357;00:37:00,259;standing here because of you.
291;00:37:00,361;00:37:03,863;The battle was lost until the
291;00:37:00,361;00:37:03,863;Knights of the Vale rode in.
292;00:37:03,965;00:37:06,165;They came because of you.
293;00:37:10,171;00:37:13,106;You told me Lord Baelish
293;00:37:10,171;00:37:13,106;sold you to the Boltons.
294;00:37:13,207;00:37:14,974;He did.
294;00:37:13,207;00:37:14,974;And you trust him?
295;00:37:16,190;00:37:18,711;Only a fool would trust Littlefinger.
296;00:37:21,850;00:37:24,617;I should have told you about him,
297;00:37:24,719;00:37:28,054;about the Knights of the Vale.
298;00:37:28,156;00:37:29,622;I'm sorry.
299;00:37:40,935;00:37:42,902;We need to trust each other.
300;00:37:43,739;00:37:46,005;We can't fight a war amongst ourselves.
301;00:37:46,107;00:37:48,607;We have so many enemies now.
302;00:38:05,405;00:38:06,893;Jon.
303;00:38:06,995;00:38:10,429;A raven came from the Citadel.
304;00:38:10,531;00:38:12,431;A white raven.
305;00:38:15,136;00:38:16,669;Winter is here.
306;00:38:28,950;00:38:32,085;Well, Father always promised, didn't he?
307;00:38:46,167;00:38:49,335;The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne,
308;00:38:49,437;00:38:51,537;he was assassinated.
309;00:38:51,639;00:38:54,207;100 red scorpions, was it?
310;00:38:54,308;00:38:56,809;You have nothing to fear
310;00:38:54,308;00:38:56,809;from us, Lady Olenna.
311;00:38:56,911;00:38:59,045;You murder your own prince,
312;00:38:59,147;00:39:00,880;but you expect me to trust you?
313;00:39:00,982;00:39:03,950;We invited you to Dorne
313;00:39:00,982;00:39:03,950;because we needed your help.
314;00:39:04,052;00:39:06,318;You came to Dorne because
314;00:39:04,052;00:39:06,318;you needed our help.
315;00:39:07,139;00:39:09,905;What is your name again?
316;00:39:09,906;00:39:11,309;Barbaro?
317;00:39:11,310;00:39:12,091;Obara.
318;00:39:12,193;00:39:15,327;Obara. You look like
318;00:39:12,193;00:39:15,327;an angry little boy.
319;00:39:15,429;00:39:18,064;Don't presume to tell me what I need.
320;00:39:18,166;00:39:21,500;Forgive my sister. What she
320;00:39:18,166;00:39:21,500;lacks in diplomacy, she makes...
321;00:39:21,602;00:39:25,104;Do shut up, dear. Anything from you?
322;00:39:25,206;00:39:27,106;No? Good.
323;00:39:27,208;00:39:29,608;Let the grown women speak.
324;00:39:30,507;00:39:33,412;The Lannisters have declared
324;00:39:30,507;00:39:33,412;war on House Tyrell.
325;00:39:33,514;00:39:36,482;They have declared war on Dorne.
326;00:39:36,584;00:39:40,219;We must be allies now
326;00:39:36,584;00:39:40,219;if we wish to survive.
327;00:39:41,522;00:39:44,490;Cersei stole the future from me.
328;00:39:44,592;00:39:46,358;She killed my son.
329;00:39:46,460;00:39:48,494;She killed my grandson.
330;00:39:48,596;00:39:51,798;She killed my granddaughter.
331;00:39:51,900;00:39:54,733;Survival is not what I'm after now.
332;00:39:54,836;00:39:57,003;You're absolutely right.
333;00:39:57,105;00:39:59,672;I chose the wrong words.
334;00:39:59,774;00:40:02,275;It is not survival I offer.
335;00:40:02,376;00:40:04,710;It is your heart's desire.
336;00:40:06,547;00:40:09,748;And what is my heart's desire?
337;00:40:11,319;00:40:13,552;Vengeance.
338;00:40:13,654;00:40:14,753;Justice.
339;00:40:18,492;00:40:20,359;Fire and blood.
340;00:40:26,835;00:40:29,635;Your ships are nearly ready.
341;00:40:29,737;00:40:32,038;I saw them painting the sails.
342;00:40:35,476;00:40:39,278;I'm curious to see how the
342;00:40:35,476;00:40:39,278;Dothraki do on the poison water.
343;00:40:39,380;00:40:41,280;You're not coming with us.
344;00:40:43,651;00:40:46,886;New strategy?
345;00:40:46,988;00:40:50,189;You want the Second Sons to
345;00:40:46,988;00:40:50,189;attack from the west coast?
346;00:40:50,291;00:40:52,892;If we take Casterly Rock,
347;00:40:52,994;00:40:56,562;the Lannisters will have nowhere to
347;00:40:52,994;00:40:56,562;run when you hit King's Landing.
348;00:40:56,664;00:40:58,597;You're not going to Westeros.
349;00:40:58,699;00:41:01,633;You're staying here
349;00:40:58,699;00:41:01,633;with the Second Sons.
350;00:41:01,736;00:41:04,370;There's finally peace in Meereen.
351;00:41:04,472;00:41:07,806;You will keep the peace while the
351;00:41:04,472;00:41:07,806;people choose their own leaders.
352;00:41:09,110;00:41:10,910;Fuck Meereen.
353;00:41:11,012;00:41:12,912;Fuck the people.
354;00:41:13,014;00:41:15,281;I'm here for you, not them.
355;00:41:15,383;00:41:17,049;You promised me.
356;00:41:17,151;00:41:20,086;My sword is yours. My life is yours.
357;00:41:20,188;00:41:23,289;This is what I command.
358;00:41:24,223;00:41:26,392;If I'm going to rule in Westeros,
359;00:41:26,494;00:41:28,995;I'll need to make alliances.
360;00:41:29,097;00:41:32,464;The best way to make
360;00:41:29,097;00:41:32,464;alliances is with marriage.
361;00:41:35,803;00:41:37,636;Who are you marrying this time?
362;00:41:37,738;00:41:41,107;I don't know. Maybe no one.
363;00:41:41,209;00:41:44,310;But you need to lure all the
363;00:41:41,209;00:41:44,310;noble houses to the table?
364;00:41:44,412;00:41:46,379;Are you a queen or fish bait?
365;00:41:48,816;00:41:51,784;I can't bring a lover to Westeros.
366;00:41:51,886;00:41:54,120;A king wouldn't think twice about it.
367;00:41:54,222;00:41:57,123;So that's what you want?
367;00:41:54,222;00:41:57,123;To be my mistress?
368;00:41:57,225;00:42:00,526;I'm not proud. I don't care
368;00:41:57,225;00:42:00,526;what perfumed aristocrat
369;00:42:00,628;00:42:02,728;sits beside you in the throne room.
370;00:42:02,830;00:42:05,864;I don't want a crown. I want you.
371;00:42:12,840;00:42:15,041;I love you.
372;00:42:15,143;00:42:17,609;And I make you happy.
373;00:42:18,202;00:42:19,578;You know I do.
374;00:42:21,816;00:42:25,517;Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.
375;00:42:33,127;00:42:34,393;I can't.
376;00:42:44,138;00:42:45,871;The dwarf told you to do this?
377;00:42:45,974;00:42:47,639;No one tells me to do anything.
378;00:42:47,741;00:42:50,909;Clever fellow. Can't
378;00:42:47,741;00:42:50,909;argue with his logic.
379;00:42:51,012;00:42:52,744;I'm no use to you over there.
380;00:42:52,847;00:42:54,113;Don't get angry.
381;00:42:54,215;00:42:57,383;I'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity.
382;00:42:57,485;00:42:59,085;Who comes after you?
383;00:42:59,187;00:43:02,355;Who can ever follow Daenerys
383;00:42:59,187;00:43:02,355;Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?
384;00:43:02,457;00:43:04,723;A great number of women, I imagine.
385;00:43:10,931;00:43:12,764;Specific orders will be left for you
386;00:43:12,867;00:43:15,801;regarding the welfare of Meereen
386;00:43:12,867;00:43:15,801;and the Bay of Dragons.
387;00:43:15,903;00:43:17,703;Bay of Dragons?
388;00:43:17,805;00:43:20,806;We can't call it Slaver's
388;00:43:17,805;00:43:20,806;Bay anymore, can we?
389;00:43:23,811;00:43:27,113;You'll get that throne you
389;00:43:23,811;00:43:27,113;want so badly, I'm sure of it.
390;00:43:28,449;00:43:30,649;I hope it brings you happiness.
391;00:43:35,723;00:43:38,324;I pity the lords of Westeros.
392;00:43:38,426;00:43:40,592;They have no idea
392;00:43:38,426;00:43:40,592;what's coming for them.
393;00:43:41,771;00:43:44,630;Farewell, Daario Naharis.
394;00:44:03,317;00:44:05,617;How did he take it?
395;00:44:05,719;00:44:07,786;No tears.
396;00:44:09,857;00:44:12,491;I know it was hard for you.
397;00:44:12,593;00:44:14,626;You turned away a man
397;00:44:12,593;00:44:14,626;who truly loves you
398;00:44:14,728;00:44:17,629;because he would have been a
398;00:44:14,728;00:44:17,629;liability in the Seven Kingdoms.
399;00:44:20,201;00:44:23,902;That's the kind of self-sacrifice
399;00:44:20,201;00:44:23,902;that makes for a good ruler,
400;00:44:24,004;00:44:26,172;if it's any consolation.
401;00:44:29,077;00:44:30,876;It's not.
402;00:44:30,978;00:44:33,279;No, I suppose not.
403;00:44:33,381;00:44:34,913;I'm terrible at consoling.
404;00:44:35,015;00:44:37,316;Yes, you really are.
405;00:44:40,488;00:44:44,690;All right, how about the fact
405;00:44:40,488;00:44:44,690;that this is actually happening?
406;00:44:46,194;00:44:49,061;You have your armies,
406;00:44:46,194;00:44:49,061;you have your ships,
407;00:44:49,163;00:44:51,163;you have your dragons.
408;00:44:51,265;00:44:53,232;Everything you've ever wanted
409;00:44:53,334;00:44:56,235;since you were old
409;00:44:53,334;00:44:56,235;enough to want anything,
410;00:44:56,337;00:44:58,204;it's all yours for the taking.
411;00:44:59,974;00:45:01,907;Are you afraid?
412;00:45:05,079;00:45:06,945;Good.
413;00:45:07,047;00:45:09,781;You're in the great game now.
414;00:45:09,883;00:45:12,451;And the great game's terrifying.
415;00:45:12,553;00:45:15,020;The only people who
415;00:45:12,553;00:45:15,020;aren't afraid of failure
416;00:45:15,123;00:45:17,223;are madmen like your father.
417;00:45:19,327;00:45:21,427;Do you know what frightens me?
418;00:45:22,896;00:45:25,564;I said farewell to a man who loves me.
419;00:45:27,435;00:45:31,003;A man I thought I cared for.
420;00:45:31,105;00:45:33,071;And I felt nothing.
421;00:45:34,675;00:45:36,575;Just impatient to get on with it.
422;00:45:39,680;00:45:42,748;He wasn't the first to love you
423;00:45:42,850;00:45:44,916;and he won't be the last.
424;00:45:48,822;00:45:53,725;Well, you have completely
424;00:45:48,822;00:45:53,725;failed to console me.
425;00:45:56,297;00:46:01,100;For what it's worth, I've been a cynic
425;00:45:56,297;00:46:01,100;for as long as I can remember.
426;00:46:01,101;00:46:03,902;Everyone's always asking
426;00:46:01,101;00:46:03,902;me to believe in things...
427;00:46:04,004;00:46:07,739;family, gods, kings, myself.
428;00:46:07,841;00:46:09,675;It was often tempting
429;00:46:09,777;00:46:12,110;until I saw where belief got people.
430;00:46:13,481;00:46:16,081;So I said no, thank you to belief.
431;00:46:16,184;00:46:19,485;And yet here I am.
432;00:46:22,190;00:46:24,456;I believe in you.
433;00:46:26,394;00:46:28,794;It's embarrassing, really.
434;00:46:30,864;00:46:32,665;I'd swear you my sword,
435;00:46:32,766;00:46:35,801;but I don't actually own a sword.
436;00:46:35,903;00:46:37,903;It's your counsel I need.
437;00:46:38,005;00:46:40,439;It's yours.
438;00:46:40,541;00:46:41,973;Now and always.
439;00:46:43,477;00:46:45,311;Good.
440;00:46:46,614;00:46:48,647;I...
441;00:46:48,749;00:46:50,516;I had something made for you.
442;00:46:52,220;00:46:54,753;I'm not sure if it's right.
443;00:47:04,064;00:47:06,765;Tyrion Lannister,
444;00:47:06,867;00:47:08,767;I name you Hand of the Queen.
445;00:47:43,003;00:47:45,537;You're not one of mine, are you?
446;00:47:45,640;00:47:47,139;No, my lord.
447;00:47:47,241;00:47:48,907;Didn't think so.
448;00:47:49,009;00:47:51,243;Too pretty.
449;00:47:55,516;00:47:58,317;Where are my damn moron sons?!
450;00:47:58,419;00:48:02,154;Black Walder and Lothar
450;00:47:58,419;00:48:02,154;promised to be here by midday.
451;00:48:02,256;00:48:04,089;They're here, my lord.
452;00:48:04,191;00:48:07,493;Well, what are they doing,
452;00:48:04,191;00:48:07,493;trimming their cunt hairs?
453;00:48:07,595;00:48:09,662;Tell them to come here now.
454;00:48:09,764;00:48:12,030;But they're already here, my lord.
455;00:48:16,069;00:48:19,070;Here, my lord.
456;00:48:37,358;00:48:39,391;They weren't easy to carve.
457;00:48:41,061;00:48:42,961;Especially Black Walder.
458;00:48:44,774;00:48:45,931;What...
459;00:48:53,040;00:48:54,707;My name is Arya Stark.
460;00:48:54,809;00:48:56,308;I want you to know that.
461;00:48:56,410;00:48:59,144;The last thing you're ever going to see
462;00:48:59,246;00:49:01,980;is a Stark smiling down
462;00:48:59,246;00:49:01,980;at you as you die.
463;00:49:56,771;00:49:58,771;Forgive me, my lady...
464;00:50:00,207;00:50:03,208;if you're at prayer.
465;00:50:03,310;00:50:05,310;I'm done with all that.
466;00:50:07,515;00:50:10,048;I came here every day when I was a girl.
467;00:50:11,752;00:50:14,586;I prayed to be somewhere else.
468;00:50:14,688;00:50:18,391;Back then I only thought about what I
468;00:50:14,688;00:50:18,391;wanted, never about what I had.
469;00:50:22,496;00:50:23,929;I was a stupid girl.
470;00:50:24,031;00:50:25,964;You were a child.
471;00:50:29,269;00:50:31,737;What do you want?
472;00:50:31,839;00:50:34,205;I thought you knew what I wanted.
473;00:50:34,308;00:50:35,908;I was wrong.
474;00:50:36,009;00:50:38,677;No, you weren't.
475;00:50:41,415;00:50:42,981;Every time I'm faced with a decision,
476;00:50:43,083;00:50:45,317;I close my eyes and
476;00:50:43,083;00:50:45,317;see the same picture.
477;00:50:47,020;00:50:50,422;Whenever I consider an
477;00:50:47,020;00:50:50,422;action, I ask myself
478;00:50:50,524;00:50:54,660;will this action help to
478;00:50:50,524;00:50:54,660;make this picture a reality?
479;00:50:56,630;00:50:59,397;Pull it out of my mind
480;00:50:59,500;00:51:01,333;and into the world?
481;00:51:03,437;00:51:06,404;And I only act if the answer is yes.
482;00:51:09,176;00:51:12,203;A picture of me...
483;00:51:12,204;00:51:14,945;on the Iron Throne...
484;00:51:16,550;00:51:18,450;and you by my side.
485;00:51:28,529;00:51:30,428;It's a pretty picture.
486;00:51:35,970;00:51:39,471;News of this battle will spread
486;00:51:35,970;00:51:39,471;quickly through the Seven Kingdoms.
487;00:51:39,573;00:51:43,074;I've declared for House
487;00:51:39,573;00:51:43,074;Stark for all to hear.
488;00:51:43,176;00:51:45,644;You've declared for other
488;00:51:43,176;00:51:45,644;houses before, Lord Baelish.
489;00:51:45,746;00:51:48,446;It's never stopped you
489;00:51:45,746;00:51:48,446;from serving yourself.
490;00:51:48,549;00:51:50,749;The past is gone for good.
491;00:51:50,851;00:51:52,918;You can sit here mourning its departure
492;00:51:53,020;00:51:55,954;or you can prepare for the future.
493;00:51:56,056;00:51:58,524;You, my love,
494;00:51:58,626;00:52:01,259;are the future of House Stark.
495;00:52:01,361;00:52:05,030;Who should the North rally behind?
496;00:52:05,132;00:52:07,833;A trueborn daughter of
496;00:52:05,132;00:52:07,833;Ned and Catelyn Stark
497;00:52:07,935;00:52:09,835;born here at Winterfell
498;00:52:09,937;00:52:13,138;or a motherless bastard
498;00:52:09,937;00:52:13,138;born in the south?
499;00:52:39,600;00:52:41,833;This is where I leave you.
500;00:52:41,936;00:52:43,735;You're not coming with us?
501;00:52:45,205;00:52:48,607;The Wall is not just ice and stone.
502;00:52:48,709;00:52:51,877;Ancient spells were carved
502;00:52:48,709;00:52:51,877;into its foundations.
503;00:52:53,681;00:52:55,747;Strong magic
504;00:52:55,849;00:52:58,984;to protect men from what lies beyond.
505;00:52:59,086;00:53:02,921;And while it stands,
505;00:52:59,086;00:53:02,921;the dead cannot pass.
506;00:53:03,023;00:53:04,022;I cannot pass.
507;00:53:20,741;00:53:22,674;Where will you go?
508;00:53:22,776;00:53:24,309;The great war is coming
509;00:53:24,411;00:53:27,212;and I still fight for the living.
510;00:53:29,282;00:53:31,382;I'll do what I can...
511;00:53:32,753;00:53:34,953;as long as I can.
512;00:53:38,859;00:53:40,959;Thank you, Uncle Benjen.
513;00:53:41,061;00:53:43,394;I wish you both good fortune.
514;00:54:22,670;00:54:25,203;Are you sure you're ready for this?
515;00:54:25,305;00:54:28,406;I'm the Three-Eyed Raven now.
516;00:54:28,508;00:54:30,742;I have to be ready for this.
517;00:55:04,974;00:55:06,978;Ned?
518;00:55:07,081;00:55:09,581;Lyanna.
519;00:55:09,683;00:55:11,783;Is that you?
520;00:55:15,555;00:55:17,555;Is that really you?
521;00:55:22,495;00:55:24,395;You're not a dream?
522;00:55:25,532;00:55:27,632;No, I'm not a dream.
523;00:55:29,302;00:55:31,169;I'm here.
524;00:55:32,840;00:55:34,606;Right here.
525;00:55:34,708;00:55:37,042;I've missed you, big brother.
526;00:55:40,380;00:55:42,380;I've missed you, too.
527;00:55:46,720;00:55:48,620;I want to be brave.
528;00:55:51,258;00:55:53,759;You are.
529;00:55:53,861;00:55:56,594;I'm not.
530;00:55:58,799;00:56:01,566;I don't want to die.
531;00:56:01,668;00:56:03,902;You're not going to die.
532;00:56:07,707;00:56:09,540;Get her some water!
533;00:56:09,643;00:56:11,943;No, no water.
533;00:56:09,643;00:56:11,943;Is there a maester?
534;00:56:12,045;00:56:14,379;Listen to me, Ned.
535;00:56:15,270;00:56:18,370;_
536;00:56:20,788;00:56:23,521;If Robert finds out, he'll...
537;00:56:23,623;00:56:25,490;you know he will.
538;00:56:25,592;00:56:27,458;You have to protect him.
539;00:56:30,530;00:56:32,430;Promise me, Ned.
540;00:56:34,835;00:56:36,701;Promise me.
541;00:56:48,849;00:56:50,816;Promise me, Ned.
542;00:56:55,289;00:56:57,088;Promise me.
543;00:57:27,654;00:57:30,555;You can't expect Knights of the Vale
544;00:57:30,657;00:57:33,291;to side with wildling invaders.
545;00:57:33,393;00:57:37,329;We didn't invade. We were invited.
546;00:57:37,430;00:57:39,130;Not by me.
547;00:57:39,233;00:57:41,032;The free folk, the northerners,
548;00:57:41,134;00:57:43,501;and the Knights of the
548;00:57:41,134;00:57:43,501;Vale fought bravely,
549;00:57:43,603;00:57:45,904;fought together, and we won.
550;00:57:46,006;00:57:50,742;My father used to say we find our
550;00:57:46,006;00:57:50,742;true friends on the battlefield.
551;00:57:50,844;00:57:53,444;The Boltons are defeated.
552;00:57:53,546;00:57:55,480;The war is over.
553;00:57:55,582;00:57:57,482;Winter has come.
554;00:57:57,584;00:58:01,086;If the maesters are right, it'll be
554;00:57:57,584;00:58:01,086;the coldest one in a thousand years.
555;00:58:01,188;00:58:04,622;We should ride home and
555;00:58:01,188;00:58:04,622;wait out the coming storms.
556;00:58:04,724;00:58:06,824;The war is not over.
557;00:58:06,927;00:58:08,960;And I promise you, friend,
558;00:58:09,062;00:58:11,997;the true enemy won't wait out the storm.
559;00:58:12,099;00:58:13,598;He brings the storm.
560;00:58:33,586;00:58:37,655;Your son was butchered at the
560;00:58:33,586;00:58:37,655;Red Wedding, Lord Manderly,
561;00:58:37,757;00:58:39,590;but you refused the call.
562;00:58:42,930;00:58:45,931;You swore allegiance to
562;00:58:42,930;00:58:45,931;House Stark, Lord Glover,
563;00:58:46,033;00:58:48,633;but in their hour of greatest need,
564;00:58:48,735;00:58:50,735;you refused the call.
565;00:58:52,839;00:58:54,872;And you, Lord Cerwyn,
566;00:58:54,975;00:58:58,843;your father was skinned
566;00:58:54,975;00:58:58,843;alive by Ramsay Bolton.
567;00:58:58,946;00:59:01,413;Still you refused the call.
568;00:59:04,517;00:59:08,386;But House Mormont remembers.
569;00:59:08,488;00:59:11,189;The North remembers.
570;00:59:11,291;00:59:15,860;We know no king but the King in
570;00:59:11,291;00:59:15,860;the North whose name is Stark.
571;00:59:17,630;00:59:19,397;I don't care if he's a bastard.
572;00:59:19,499;00:59:22,100;Ned Stark's blood runs
572;00:59:19,499;00:59:22,100;through his veins.
573;00:59:22,202;00:59:26,671;He's my king from this
573;00:59:22,202;00:59:26,671;day until his last day.
574;00:59:43,357;00:59:45,923;Lady Mormont speaks harshly
575;00:59:46,026;00:59:47,325;and truly.
576;00:59:50,730;00:59:55,833;My son died for Robb
576;00:59:50,730;00:59:55,833;Stark, the Young Wolf.
577;00:59:55,935;00:59:59,004;I didn't think we'd find
577;00:59:55,935;00:59:59,004;another king in my lifetime.
578;00:59:59,106;01:00:01,539;I didn't commit my men to your cause
579;01:00:01,641;01:00:04,275;'cause I didn't want more
579;01:00:01,641;01:00:04,275;Manderlys dying for nothing.
580;01:00:06,546;01:00:08,013;But I was wrong.
581;01:00:13,720;01:00:15,953;Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding.
582;01:00:16,693;01:00:18,456;He is the White Wolf.
583;01:00:18,558;01:00:21,493;The King in the North.
584;01:00:28,968;01:00:31,436;I did not fight beside you on the field
585;01:00:31,538;01:00:34,972;and I will regret that
585;01:00:31,538;01:00:34,972;until my dying day.
586;01:00:35,880;01:00:39,710;A man can only admit when he was wrong
587;01:00:39,812;01:00:41,379;and ask forgiveness.
588;01:00:44,384;01:00:46,684;There's nothing to forgive, my lord.
589;01:00:49,289;01:00:51,789;There will be more fights to come.
590;01:00:51,891;01:00:55,427;House Glover will stand
590;01:00:51,891;01:00:55,427;behind House Stark
591;01:00:55,529;01:00:57,828;as we have for a thousand years.
592;01:00:59,666;01:01:01,899;And I will stand behind Jon Snow...
593;01:01:04,337;01:01:06,404;the King in the North!
594;01:01:08,308;01:01:11,209;The King in the North!
595;01:01:11,311;01:01:52,872;The King in the North!
595;01:01:11,311;01:01:52,872;The King in the North!
596;01:01:54,787;01:01:56,787;Company halt!
597;01:01:59,792;01:02:01,259;Halt!
598;01:02:03,130;01:02:05,263;Halt!
599;01:02:17,233;01:02:18,242;Come on.
600;01:03:12,932;01:03:16,701;I now proclaim Cersei
600;01:03:12,932;01:03:16,701;of the House Lannister
601;01:03:16,803;01:03:19,437;First of Her Name,
602;01:03:19,539;01:03:22,907;Queen of the Andals and the First Men,
603;01:03:23,009;01:03:26,211;Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.
604;01:04:12,058;01:04:14,125;Long may she reign.
605;01:04:14,227;01:04:16,394;Long may she reign.
