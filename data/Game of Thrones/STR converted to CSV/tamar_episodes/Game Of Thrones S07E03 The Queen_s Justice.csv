53;00:05:58,950;00:06:01,450;Does she miss me terribly?
54;00:06:04,620;00:06:07,039;A sham marriage.
54;00:06:04,620;00:06:07,039;And unconsummated.
55;00:06:07,040;00:06:10,199;I didn't ask.
55;00:06:07,040;00:06:10,199;Well, it was. Wasn't.
56;00:06:10,200;00:06:12,119;Anyway...
57;00:06:12,120;00:06:14,949;she's much smarter
57;00:06:12,120;00:06:14,949;than she lets on.
58;00:06:14,950;00:06:17,329;She's starting to let on.

61;00:06:20,290;00:06:24,239;became King in the North.
62;00:06:24,240;00:06:26,039;As long as you tell me
62;00:06:24,240;00:06:26,039;how a Lannister
63;00:06:26,040;00:06:28,829;became Hand
63;00:06:26,040;00:06:28,829;to Daenerys Targaryen.
64;00:06:28,830;00:06:30,949;A long and bloody tale.
65;00:06:30,950;00:06:33,700;To be honest,
65;00:06:30,950;00:06:33,700;I was drunk for most of it.

67;00:06:38,870;00:06:40,289;Of course they do.

68;00:06:40,290;00:06:43,000;I would have advised

78;00:07:33,410;00:07:36,999;I wondered why
78;00:07:33,410;00:07:36,999;you weren't there
78;00:07:33,410;00:07:36,999;to meet our guests.
79;00:07:37,000;00:07:39,999;You begged us to summon

80;00:07:40,000;00:07:42,449;Don't you want to see him again?
81;00:07:42,450;00:07:45,079;I've done my part.
82;00:07:45,080;00:07:47,489;I've brought
82;00:07:45,080;00:07:47,489;ice and fire together.
83;00:07:47,490;00:07:49,789;Strange.
84;00:07:49,790;00:07:52,289;You spoke so highly of Jon Snow,
85;00:07:52,290;00:07:55,949;but when he arrives,
85;00:07:52,290;00:07:55,949;you hide on a cliff.
86;00:07:55,950;00:07:58,329;I didn't take you
86;00:07:55,950;00:07:58,329;for a bashful girl.
87;00:07:58,330;00:08:02,539;My time whispering

87;00:07:58,330;00:08:02,539;has come to an end.
88;00:08:02,540;00:08:04,949;Oh, I doubt that.
89;00:08:04,950;00:08:07,579;Give us common folk

93;00:08:19,040;00:08:20,829;I did not part on good terms

94;00:08:20,830;00:08:23,829;or his advisor.
95;00:08:23,830;00:08:24,830;Why?
96;00:08:26,490;00:08:28,540;Because of mistakes I made.
97;00:08:30,660;00:08:32,540;Terrible mistakes.
98;00:08:34,370;00:08:37,489;I would only be

131;00:10:52,240;00:10:57,289;Torrhen Stark swore fealty
131;00:10:52,240;00:10:57,289;to House Targaryen
131;00:10:52,240;00:10:57,289;in perpetuity.
132;00:10:57,290;00:10:58,789;Or do I have my facts wrong?
133;00:10:58,790;00:11:01,119;I wasn't there, Your Grace.
134;00:11:01,120;00:11:03,539;No, of course not.
135;00:11:03,540;00:11:06,119;But still, an oath is an oath.
136;00:11:06,120;00:11:08,539;And perpetuity means--
137;00:11:08,540;00:11:10,999;what does perpetuity mean,
137;00:11:08,540;00:11:10,999;Lord Tyrion?
138;00:11:11,000;00:11:12,489;Forever.
139;00:11:12,490;00:11:14,579;Forever.
140;00:11:14,580;00:11:17,409;So I assume, my lord...
140;00:11:14,580;00:11:17,409;( sighs )
141;00:11:17,410;00:11:19,620;...you're here
141;00:11:17,410;00:11:19,620;to bend the knee.
142;00:11:22,160;00:11:23,700;I am not.
143;00:11:25,330;00:11:26,829;Oh.
144;00:11:26,830;00:11:28,660;Well, that is unfortunate.
145;00:11:30,000;00:11:31,659;You've traveled all this way
146;00:11:31,660;00:11:33,829;to break faith
146;00:11:31,660;00:11:33,829;with House Targaryen?
147;00:11:33,830;00:11:36,329;Break faith?
148;00:11:36,330;00:11:38,659;Your father burned
148;00:11:36,330;00:11:38,659;my grandfather alive.
149;00:11:38,660;00:11:40,369;He burned my uncle alive.
150;00:11:40,370;00:11:41,699;He would have burned
150;00:11:40,370;00:11:41,699;the Seven Kingdoms--
151;00:11:41,700;00:11:44,790;My father...
151;00:11:41,700;00:11:44,790;was an evil man.
152;00:11:46,620;00:11:48,830;On behalf of House Targaryen...
153;00:11:50,080;00:11:51,699;I ask your forgiveness
154;00:11:51,700;00:11:54,659;for the crimes he committed
154;00:11:51,700;00:11:54,659;against your family.
155;00:11:54,660;00:11:57,539;And I ask you
155;00:11:54,660;00:11:57,539;not to judge a daughter
156;00:11:57,540;00:11:59,910;by the sins of her father.
157;00:12:01,370;00:12:04,869;Our two houses
157;00:12:01,370;00:12:04,869;were allies for centuries,
158;00:12:04,870;00:12:06,749;and those were
158;00:12:04,870;00:12:06,749;the best centuries
159;00:12:06,750;00:12:08,869;the Seven Kingdoms
159;00:12:06,750;00:12:08,869;have ever known.
160;00:12:08,870;00:12:11,369;Centuries of peace
160;00:12:08,870;00:12:11,369;and prosperity
161;00:12:11,370;00:12:14,199;with a Targaryen
161;00:12:11,370;00:12:14,199;sitting on the Iron Throne
162;00:12:14,200;00:12:18,199;and a Stark serving
162;00:12:14,200;00:12:18,199;as Warden of the North.
163;00:12:18,200;00:12:21,949;I am the last Targaryen,
163;00:12:18,200;00:12:21,949;Jon Snow.
164;00:12:21,950;00:12:24,369;Honor the pledge
164;00:12:21,950;00:12:24,369;your ancestor made to mine.
165;00:12:24,370;00:12:28,039;Bend the knee
165;00:12:24,370;00:12:28,039;and I will name you
165;00:12:24,370;00:12:28,039;Warden of the North.
166;00:12:28,040;00:12:30,239;Together, we will
166;00:12:28,040;00:12:30,239;save this country
167;00:12:30,240;00:12:32,870;from those who would destroy it.
168;00:12:42,700;00:12:44,749;You're right.
169;00:12:44,750;00:12:47,239;You're not guilty
169;00:12:44,750;00:12:47,239;of your father's crimes.
170;00:12:47,240;00:12:52,079;And I'm not beholden
170;00:12:47,240;00:12:52,079;to my ancestor's vows.
171;00:12:52,080;00:12:54,079;Then why are you here?
172;00:12:54,080;00:12:56,910;Because I need your help,
172;00:12:54,080;00:12:56,910;and you need mine.
173;00:13:00,120;00:13:02,079;Did you see three dragons
174;00:13:02,080;00:13:04,039;flying overhead
174;00:13:02,080;00:13:04,039;when you arrived?
175;00:13:04,040;00:13:05,119;I did.
176;00:13:05,120;00:13:07,409;And did you see the Dothraki,
177;00:13:07,410;00:13:09,619;all of whom have sworn
177;00:13:07,410;00:13:09,619;to kill for me?
178;00:13:09,620;00:13:11,579;They're hard to miss.
179;00:13:11,580;00:13:15,619;But still,
179;00:13:11,580;00:13:15,619;I need your help?
179;00:13:11,580;00:13:15,619;Davos: Not to defeat Cersei.
180;00:13:15,620;00:13:18,949;You could storm
180;00:13:15,620;00:13:18,949;King's Landing tomorrow
180;00:13:15,620;00:13:18,949;and the city would fall.
181;00:13:18,950;00:13:21,199;Hell, we almost took it
181;00:13:18,950;00:13:21,199;and we didn't even
181;00:13:18,950;00:13:21,199;have dragons.
182;00:13:21,200;00:13:25,329;Almost.
182;00:13:21,200;00:13:25,329;But you haven't
182;00:13:21,200;00:13:25,329;stormed King's Landing.
183;00:13:25,330;00:13:26,949;Why not?
184;00:13:26,950;00:13:28,659;The only reason I can see
185;00:13:28,660;00:13:30,909;is you don't want to kill
185;00:13:28,660;00:13:30,909;thousands of innocent people.
186;00:13:30,910;00:13:32,949;It's the fastest way
186;00:13:30,910;00:13:32,949;to win the war,
187;00:13:32,950;00:13:34,789;but you won't do it,
188;00:13:34,790;00:13:37,999;which means, at the very least,
189;00:13:38,000;00:13:39,450;you're better than Cersei.
190;00:13:40,950;00:13:44,330;Still, that doesn't explain
190;00:13:40,950;00:13:44,330;why I need your help.
191;00:13:46,200;00:13:50,829;Because right now,
191;00:13:46,200;00:13:50,829;you and I and Cersei
191;00:13:46,200;00:13:50,829;and everyone else,
192;00:13:50,830;00:13:52,449;we're children
192;00:13:50,830;00:13:52,449;playing at a game,
193;00:13:52,450;00:13:54,539;screaming that
193;00:13:52,450;00:13:54,539;the rules aren't fair.
194;00:13:54,540;00:13:56,659;You told me
194;00:13:54,540;00:13:56,659;you liked this man.
194;00:13:54,540;00:13:56,659;I do.
195;00:13:56,660;00:14:00,159;In the time since he's met me,
195;00:13:56,660;00:14:00,159;he's refused to call me queen,
196;00:14:00,160;00:14:03,039;he's refused to bow,
196;00:14:00,160;00:14:03,039;and now he's calling me
196;00:14:00,160;00:14:03,039;a child.
197;00:14:03,040;00:14:06,829;I believe he's calling
197;00:14:03,040;00:14:06,829;all of us children.
197;00:14:03,040;00:14:06,829;Figure of speech.
198;00:14:06,830;00:14:10,159;Your Grace,
198;00:14:06,830;00:14:10,159;everyone you know will die
198;00:14:06,830;00:14:10,159;before winter's over
199;00:14:10,160;00:14:12,329;if we don't defeat
199;00:14:10,160;00:14:12,329;the enemy to the north.
200;00:14:12,330;00:14:14,999;As far as I can see,
200;00:14:12,330;00:14:14,999;you are the enemy
200;00:14:12,330;00:14:14,999;to the north.
201;00:14:15,000;00:14:16,660;I am not your enemy.
202;00:14:18,080;00:14:19,999;The dead are the enemy.
203;00:14:20,000;00:14:21,540;The dead?
204;00:14:22,830;00:14:24,409;Is that another
204;00:14:22,830;00:14:24,409;figure of speech?
205;00:14:24,410;00:14:26,039;The Army of the Dead
205;00:14:24,410;00:14:26,039;is on the march.
206;00:14:26,040;00:14:28,119;The Army of the Dead?
207;00:14:28,120;00:14:30,289;You don't know me well, my lord,
208;00:14:30,290;00:14:33,619;but do you think
208;00:14:30,290;00:14:33,619;I'm a liar or a madman?
209;00:14:33,620;00:14:36,159;No, I don't think
209;00:14:33,620;00:14:36,159;you're either of those things.
210;00:14:36,160;00:14:38,289;The Army of the Dead is real.
211;00:14:38,290;00:14:39,749;The white walkers are real.
212;00:14:39,750;00:14:42,659;The Night King is real.
212;00:14:39,750;00:14:42,659;I've seen them.
213;00:14:42,660;00:14:44,199;If they get past the Wall
214;00:14:44,200;00:14:46,700;and we're squabbling
214;00:14:44,200;00:14:46,700;amongst ourselves...
215;00:14:49,750;00:14:51,330;we're finished.
216;00:14:56,910;00:14:59,200;I was born at Dragonstone.
217;00:15:00,830;00:15:03,539;Not that I can remember it.
218;00:15:03,540;00:15:06,999;We fled before
218;00:15:03,540;00:15:06,999;Robert's assassins
218;00:15:03,540;00:15:06,999;could find us.
219;00:15:07,000;00:15:10,199;Robert was your father's
219;00:15:07,000;00:15:10,199;best friend, no?
220;00:15:10,200;00:15:14,039;I wonder if your father knew
220;00:15:10,200;00:15:14,039;his best friend sent assassins
221;00:15:14,040;00:15:16,580;to murder a baby girl
221;00:15:14,040;00:15:16,580;in her crib.
222;00:15:18,040;00:15:19,950;Not that it matters now,
222;00:15:18,040;00:15:19,950;of course.
223;00:15:21,490;00:15:25,039;I spent my life
223;00:15:21,490;00:15:25,039;in foreign lands.
224;00:15:25,040;00:15:27,409;So many men
224;00:15:25,040;00:15:27,409;have tried to kill me,
225;00:15:27,410;00:15:30,909;I don't remember
225;00:15:27,410;00:15:30,909;all their names.
226;00:15:30,910;00:15:34,999;I have been sold
226;00:15:30,910;00:15:34,999;like a broodmare.
227;00:15:35,000;00:15:38,539;I've been chained and betrayed,
228;00:15:38,540;00:15:41,329;raped and defiled.
229;00:15:41,330;00:15:43,579;Do you know
229;00:15:41,330;00:15:43,579;what kept me standing
230;00:15:43,580;00:15:46,539;through all those years
230;00:15:43,580;00:15:46,539;in exile?
231;00:15:46,540;00:15:49,489;Faith.
232;00:15:49,490;00:15:51,749;Not in any gods,
233;00:15:51,750;00:15:55,289;not in myths and legends.
234;00:15:55,290;00:15:57,909;In myself.
235;00:15:57,910;00:16:01,079;In Daenerys Targaryen.
236;00:16:01,080;00:16:04,619;The world hadn't seen
236;00:16:01,080;00:16:04,619;a dragon in centuries
237;00:16:04,620;00:16:06,999;until my children were born.
238;00:16:07,000;00:16:11,789;The Dothraki hadn't
238;00:16:07,000;00:16:11,789;crossed the sea, any sea.
239;00:16:11,790;00:16:14,159;They did for me.
240;00:16:14,160;00:16:18,619;I was born to rule
240;00:16:14,160;00:16:18,619;the Seven Kingdoms,
241;00:16:18,620;00:16:20,750;and I will.
242;00:16:23,080;00:16:25,619;You'll be ruling
242;00:16:23,080;00:16:25,619;over a graveyard
243;00:16:25,620;00:16:27,950;if we don't defeat
243;00:16:25,620;00:16:27,950;the Night King.
244;00:16:29,370;00:16:32,579;The war against my sister
244;00:16:29,370;00:16:32,579;has already begun.
245;00:16:32,580;00:16:34,949;You can't expect us
245;00:16:32,580;00:16:34,949;to halt hostilities
246;00:16:34,950;00:16:36,789;and join you in fighting
247;00:16:36,790;00:16:38,290;whatever you saw
247;00:16:36,790;00:16:38,290;beyond the Wall.
248;00:16:41,160;00:16:42,699;You don't believe him.
249;00:16:42,700;00:16:45,619;I understand that.
249;00:16:42,700;00:16:45,619;It sounds like nonsense.
250;00:16:45,620;00:16:49,409;But if destiny has
250;00:16:45,620;00:16:49,409;brought Daenerys Targaryen
250;00:16:45,620;00:16:49,409;back to our shores,
251;00:16:49,410;00:16:52,619;it has also made Jon Snow
251;00:16:49,410;00:16:52,619;King in the North.
252;00:16:52,620;00:16:55,749;You were the first

380;00:25:05,450;00:25:07,659;The sound of your scream.
381;00:25:07,660;00:25:09,159;I never heard a sound like that.
382;00:25:09,160;00:25:11,120;I thought,
382;00:25:09,160;00:25:11,120;That's true love.
383;00:25:12,700;00:25:14,999;Oberyn looked
383;00:25:12,700;00:25:14,999;beautiful that day.
383;00:25:12,700;00:25:14,999;He really did.
384;00:25:15,000;00:25:16,369;No one moved like him.
385;00:25:16,370;00:25:19,489;No one had such skill
385;00:25:16,370;00:25:19,489;with a spear.
386;00:25:19,490;00:25:22,579;Even Ser Gregor
386;00:25:19,490;00:25:22,579;couldn't stop him.
387;00:25:22,580;00:25:25,039;If only he hadn't taunted him.
388;00:25:25,040;00:25:28,999;He could've walked away
388;00:25:25,040;00:25:28,999;and left poor Ser Gregor
388;00:25:25,040;00:25:28,999;to die.
389;00:25:29,000;00:25:31,039;But that wasn't
389;00:25:29,000;00:25:31,039;your lover's way, was it?
390;00:25:31,040;00:25:33,869;Now he's buried somewhere.
391;00:25:33,870;00:25:36,619;And here's Ser Gregor,
391;00:25:33,870;00:25:36,619;stronger than ever.
392;00:25:36,620;00:25:38,540;That must be difficult for you.
393;00:25:42,490;00:25:44,489;When my daughter
393;00:25:42,490;00:25:44,489;was taken from me,
394;00:25:44,490;00:25:47,619;my only daughter...
395;00:25:47,620;00:25:50,409;well, you can't
395;00:25:47,620;00:25:50,409;imagine how that feels
396;00:25:50,410;00:25:52,659;unless you've lost a child.
397;00:25:52,660;00:25:55,329;I fed her at my own breast
397;00:25:52,660;00:25:55,329;even though they told me
398;00:25:55,330;00:25:58,039;to give her to the wet nurse.
399;00:25:58,040;00:26:01,539;I couldn't bear to see her
399;00:25:58,040;00:26:01,539;in another woman's arms.
400;00:26:01,540;00:26:03,789;I never got to have a mother,
401;00:26:03,790;00:26:05,199;but Myrcella did.
402;00:26:05,200;00:26:08,869;She was mine,
402;00:26:05,200;00:26:08,869;and you took her from me.
403;00:26:08,870;00:26:10,910;Why did you do that?
404;00:26:17,490;00:26:18,870;Doesn't matter now.
405;00:26:27,450;00:26:30,199;Your daughter's a beauty, too.
406;00:26:30,200;00:26:32,829;Those brown eyes.
407;00:26:32,830;00:26:34,540;Those lips.
408;00:26:36,160;00:26:38,199;Perfect Dornish beauty.
409;00:26:38,200;00:26:40,079;I imagine she's your favorite.

411;00:26:43,240;00:26:45,410;but still, we're only human.

415;00:26:53,370;00:26:56,749;That gag makes it
415;00:26:53,370;00:26:56,749;impossible to understand
415;00:26:53,370;00:26:56,749;what you're saying.
416;00:26:56,750;00:26:58,580;It must be frustrating.
417;00:27:01,750;00:27:04,749;We all make our choices.
418;00:27:04,750;00:27:07,159;You chose to murder my daughter.
419;00:27:07,160;00:27:09,409;You must have felt powerful
419;00:27:07,160;00:27:09,409;after you made that choice.

422;00:27:19,580;00:27:21,949;Not at all, really.
423;00:27:21,950;00:27:23,869;I lie in bed
423;00:27:21,950;00:27:23,869;and I stare at the canopy
424;00:27:23,870;00:27:26,239;and imagine ways
424;00:27:23,870;00:27:26,239;of killing my enemies.

428;00:27:35,450;00:27:40,159;poetic, I suppose,

500;00:32:37,450;00:32:39,489;My armada owns the Narrow Sea.
501;00:32:39,490;00:32:41,949;Euron Greyjoy's armada
501;00:32:39,490;00:32:41,949;owns the Narrow Sea.
502;00:32:41,950;00:32:43,449;Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.
503;00:32:43,450;00:32:45,659;For now.
504;00:32:45,660;00:32:49,409;Daenerys Targaryen has
504;00:32:45,660;00:32:49,409;three full-grown dragons.
505;00:32:49,410;00:32:53,749;How well do
505;00:32:49,410;00:32:53,749;wooden ships fare against
505;00:32:49,410;00:32:53,749;fire-breathing dragons?
506;00:32:53,750;00:32:58,789;Her dragons might not be
506;00:32:53,750;00:32:58,789;as invulnerable as some think.
507;00:32:58,790;00:33:01,159;But let's talk about
507;00:32:58,790;00:33:01,159;the Targaryen girl.
508;00:33:01,160;00:33:03,079;You want to invest in her?
509;00:33:03,080;00:33:07,449;I'm guessing the Iron Bank
509;00:33:03,080;00:33:07,449;invested considerable gold
509;00:33:03,080;00:33:07,449;in the slave trade.
510;00:33:07,450;00:33:09,699;How are your profits
511;00:33:09,700;00:33:12,239;now that Daenerys
511;00:33:09,700;00:33:12,239;has freed all the slaves?
512;00:33:12,240;00:33:16,409;The slave trade has
512;00:33:12,240;00:33:16,409;entered a downturn,
512;00:33:12,240;00:33:16,409;it's true.
513;00:33:16,410;00:33:18,289;From what I gather,
513;00:33:16,410;00:33:18,289;she considers herself
514;00:33:18,290;00:33:21,619;more of a revolutionary
514;00:33:18,290;00:33:21,619;than a monarch.
515;00:33:21,620;00:33:25,539;In your experience,
515;00:33:21,620;00:33:25,539;how do bankers usually
515;00:33:21,620;00:33:25,539;fare with revolutionaries?
516;00:33:25,540;00:33:28,539;The Lannisters
516;00:33:25,540;00:33:28,539;owe the Iron Bank
516;00:33:25,540;00:33:28,539;quite a lot of money,
517;00:33:28,540;00:33:30,699;but Lannisters
517;00:33:28,540;00:33:30,699;always pay their debts.
518;00:33:30,700;00:33:35,120;Do former slaves
518;00:33:30,700;00:33:35,120;or Dothraki or dragons?
519;00:33:38,700;00:33:40,699;Your father's daughter, indeed.
520;00:33:40,700;00:33:42,039;Give me a fortnight.
521;00:33:42,040;00:33:44,239;Stay in King's Landing
521;00:33:42,040;00:33:44,239;as my honored guest.
522;00:33:44,240;00:33:45,659;And when you return to Braavos,
523;00:33:45,660;00:33:50,120;I swear to you, my debt
523;00:33:45,660;00:33:50,120;will be paid in full.
524;00:34:13,750;00:34:17,580;I came down here to brood
524;00:34:13,750;00:34:17,580;over my failure to predict
524;00:34:13,750;00:34:17,580;the Greyjoy attack.
525;00:34:20,120;00:34:21,659;You're making it difficult.
526;00:34:21,660;00:34:25,330;You look a lot better
526;00:34:21,660;00:34:25,330;brooding than I do.
527;00:34:27,040;00:34:29,579;You make me feel like
527;00:34:27,040;00:34:29,579;I'm failing at brooding
527;00:34:27,040;00:34:29,579;over failing.
528;00:34:29,580;00:34:31,289;I'm a prisoner on this island.
529;00:34:31,290;00:34:35,239;I wouldn't say you're
529;00:34:31,290;00:34:35,239;a prisoner on this island.
530;00:34:35,240;00:34:36,749;You're free to walk the castle,
531;00:34:36,750;00:34:38,659;the beaches,
531;00:34:36,750;00:34:38,659;to go wherever you want.
532;00:34:38,660;00:34:40,829;Except to my ship.
533;00:34:40,830;00:34:42,239;You took my ship.
534;00:34:42,240;00:34:44,199;I wouldn't say
534;00:34:42,240;00:34:44,199;we took your ship.
535;00:34:44,200;00:34:46,699;I'm not playing
535;00:34:44,200;00:34:46,699;word games with you.
536;00:34:46,700;00:34:48,579;The dead are coming for us all.
537;00:34:48,580;00:34:50,239;Why don't you
537;00:34:48,580;00:34:50,239;figure out what to do
538;00:34:50,240;00:34:52,329;about my missing fleet
538;00:34:50,240;00:34:52,329;and murdered allies,
539;00:34:52,330;00:34:55,199;and I'll figure out what to do
539;00:34:52,330;00:34:55,199;about your walking dead men.
540;00:34:55,200;00:34:57,409;It's hard
540;00:34:55,200;00:34:57,409;for me to fathom.
540;00:34:55,200;00:34:57,409;It really is.
541;00:34:57,410;00:35:00,540;If someone told me
541;00:34:57,410;00:35:00,540;about the white walkers
541;00:34:57,410;00:35:00,540;and the Night King...
542;00:35:07,950;00:35:09,200;You probably don't believe me.
543;00:35:11,660;00:35:13,829;I do, actually.
544;00:35:13,830;00:35:15,370;You didn't before.
545;00:35:17,080;00:35:19,289;Grumkins and snarks,
545;00:35:17,080;00:35:19,289;you called them.
546;00:35:19,290;00:35:21,369;Do you remember?
547;00:35:21,370;00:35:23,449;You said it was all nonsense.
548;00:35:23,450;00:35:26,579;It was nonsense.
548;00:35:23,450;00:35:26,579;Everybody knew it.
549;00:35:26,580;00:35:29,699;But then Mormont saw them
550;00:35:29,700;00:35:31,119;and you saw them.
551;00:35:31,120;00:35:32,789;And I trust the eyes
551;00:35:31,120;00:35:32,789;of an honest man
552;00:35:32,790;00:35:34,790;more than I trust
552;00:35:32,790;00:35:34,790;what everybody knows.
553;00:35:36,120;00:35:38,369;How do I convince people
553;00:35:36,120;00:35:38,369;who don't know me
554;00:35:38,370;00:35:41,119;that an enemy
554;00:35:38,370;00:35:41,119;they don't believe in
554;00:35:38,370;00:35:41,119;is coming to kill them all?
555;00:35:41,120;00:35:44,449;Good question.
555;00:35:41,120;00:35:44,449;I know it's a good question.
556;00:35:44,450;00:35:46,619;I'm looking for an answer.
557;00:35:46,620;00:35:50,909;People's minds
557;00:35:46,620;00:35:50,909;aren't made for
557;00:35:46,620;00:35:50,909;problems that large.
558;00:35:50,910;00:35:53,369;White walkers, the Night King,
559;00:35:53,370;00:35:55,449;Army of the Dead--
560;00:35:55,450;00:35:57,079;it's almost a relief to confront
561;00:35:57,080;00:35:59,950;a comfortable,
561;00:35:57,080;00:35:59,950;familiar monster
561;00:35:57,080;00:35:59,950;like my sister.
562;00:36:02,290;00:36:05,240;I need to help
562;00:36:02,290;00:36:05,240;prepare my people
562;00:36:02,290;00:36:05,240;for what's coming.
563;00:36:06,950;00:36:09,290;I can't help them from here.
564;00:36:10,790;00:36:12,040;I'd like to leave.
565;00:36:13,490;00:36:15,999;It seems unlikely that
565;00:36:13,490;00:36:15,999;you became King in the North
566;00:36:16,000;00:36:17,660;by giving up that easily.
567;00:36:19,830;00:36:22,949;Everyone told me to learn
567;00:36:19,830;00:36:22,949;from my father's mistakes.
568;00:36:22,950;00:36:24,749;Don't go south.
569;00:36:24,750;00:36:27,409;Don't answer a summons
569;00:36:24,750;00:36:27,409;from the Mad King's daughter,
570;00:36:27,410;00:36:28,830;a foreign invader.
571;00:36:31,200;00:36:33,909;And here I am,
572;00:36:33,910;00:36:35,449;a Northern fool.
573;00:36:35,450;00:36:37,909;Children are not their fathers,
574;00:36:37,910;00:36:39,620;luckily for all of us.
575;00:36:41,120;00:36:43,329;And sometimes there's more
575;00:36:41,120;00:36:43,329;to foreign invaders
576;00:36:43,330;00:36:45,539;and Northern fools
576;00:36:43,330;00:36:45,539;than meets the eye.
577;00:36:45,540;00:36:49,749;Daenerys could have sailed
577;00:36:45,540;00:36:49,749;for Westeros long ago,
577;00:36:45,540;00:36:49,749;but she didn't.
578;00:36:49,750;00:36:51,579;Instead, she stayed
578;00:36:49,750;00:36:51,579;where she was
579;00:36:51,580;00:36:54,239;and saved many people
579;00:36:51,580;00:36:54,239;from horrible fates,
580;00:36:54,240;00:36:56,579;some of whom
580;00:36:54,240;00:36:56,579;are on this island
580;00:36:54,240;00:36:56,579;with us right now.
581;00:36:56,580;00:36:58,159;While you're our guest here,
582;00:36:58,160;00:36:59,699;you might consider asking them
583;00:36:59,700;00:37:02,449;what they think
583;00:36:59,700;00:37:02,449;of the Mad King's daughter.
584;00:37:02,450;00:37:05,539;She protects people
584;00:37:02,450;00:37:05,539;from monsters,
585;00:37:05,540;00:37:07,079;just as you do.
586;00:37:07,080;00:37:09,539;It's why she came here.
587;00:37:09,540;00:37:11,079;And she's not about
587;00:37:09,540;00:37:11,079;to head north
588;00:37:11,080;00:37:12,539;to fight an enemy
588;00:37:11,080;00:37:12,539;she's never seen
589;00:37:12,540;00:37:15,039;on the word of a man
589;00:37:12,540;00:37:15,039;she doesn't know.
590;00:37:15,040;00:37:17,449;After a single meeting,
591;00:37:17,450;00:37:20,240;it's not a reasonable
591;00:37:17,450;00:37:20,240;thing to ask.
592;00:37:26,620;00:37:28,870;So, do you have anything
592;00:37:26,620;00:37:28,870;reasonable to ask?
593;00:37:33,700;00:37:34,869;What do you mean?
594;00:37:34,870;00:37:37,119;Maybe you are a Northern fool.
595;00:37:37,120;00:37:40,790;I'm asking
595;00:37:37,120;00:37:40,790;if there's something
595;00:37:37,120;00:37:40,790;I can do to help you.
596;00:37:43,750;00:37:45,289;Dragonglass?
596;00:37:43,750;00:37:45,289;Tyrion: Yes.
597;00:37:45,290;00:37:47,749;Volcanic glass, obsidian.
598;00:37:47,750;00:37:49,749;He says you have
598;00:37:47,750;00:37:49,749;a tremendous amount
598;00:37:47,750;00:37:49,749;of it here.
599;00:37:49,750;00:37:51,539;Why are we talking about glass?
600;00:37:51,540;00:37:53,409;We just lost two of our allies.
601;00:37:53,410;00:37:56,790;Which is why I was
601;00:37:53,410;00:37:56,790;speaking to Jon Snow,
601;00:37:53,410;00:37:56,790;a potential ally.
602;00:37:59,160;00:38:02,909;And what does
602;00:37:59,160;00:38:02,909;the King in the North
602;00:37:59,160;00:38:02,909;want with dragonglass?
603;00:38:02,910;00:38:05,239;Apparently, it can be
603;00:38:02,910;00:38:05,239;turned into weapons
604;00:38:05,240;00:38:08,369;that kill white walkers
604;00:38:05,240;00:38:08,369;and their foot soldiers.
605;00:38:08,370;00:38:10,539;Or stop them.
606;00:38:10,540;00:38:11,829;Destroy them.
607;00:38:11,830;00:38:13,450;Unsure about the nomenclature.
608;00:38:15,410;00:38:18,369;And what do you think
608;00:38:15,410;00:38:18,369;about this Army of the Dead
609;00:38:18,370;00:38:21,239;and white walkers
609;00:38:18,370;00:38:21,239;and Night Kings?
610;00:38:21,240;00:38:23,869;I'd very much
610;00:38:21,240;00:38:23,869;like to believe
610;00:38:21,240;00:38:23,869;that Jon Snow is wrong.
611;00:38:23,870;00:38:27,119;But a wise man once said
611;00:38:23,870;00:38:27,119;that you should never
611;00:38:23,870;00:38:27,119;believe a thing
612;00:38:27,120;00:38:29,660;simply because
612;00:38:27,120;00:38:29,660;you want to believe it.
613;00:38:32,370;00:38:35,539;Which wise man said this?
614;00:38:35,540;00:38:37,409;I don't remember.
615;00:38:37,410;00:38:40,830;Are you trying to present
615;00:38:37,410;00:38:40,830;your own statements
615;00:38:37,410;00:38:40,830;as ancient wisdom?
616;00:38:42,040;00:38:44,239;I would never do that.
617;00:38:44,240;00:38:45,290;To you.
618;00:38:47,120;00:38:50,789;The reason
618;00:38:47,120;00:38:50,789;I believe Jon Snow
618;00:38:47,120;00:38:50,789;is because he's here.
619;00:38:50,790;00:38:53,199;All of his advisors
619;00:38:50,790;00:38:53,199;would have told him
619;00:38:50,790;00:38:53,199;not to come.
620;00:38:53,200;00:38:55,289;I would have told him
620;00:38:53,200;00:38:55,289;not to come.
621;00:38:55,290;00:38:57,619;And he's here anyway.
622;00:38:57,620;00:39:00,039;You don't have to believe him.
623;00:39:00,040;00:39:02,079;Let him mine the dragonglass.
624;00:39:02,080;00:39:03,699;If he's wrong, it's worthless.
625;00:39:03,700;00:39:05,789;You didn't even know
625;00:39:03,700;00:39:05,789;it was here.
626;00:39:05,790;00:39:08,329;It's nothing to you.
627;00:39:08,330;00:39:11,619;Give him something
627;00:39:08,330;00:39:11,619;by giving him nothing.
628;00:39:11,620;00:39:14,329;Take a step toward
628;00:39:11,620;00:39:14,329;a more productive
628;00:39:11,620;00:39:14,329;relationship
629;00:39:14,330;00:39:16,909;with a possible ally.
630;00:39:16,910;00:39:20,289;Keep him occupied
630;00:39:16,910;00:39:20,289;while we focus on
630;00:39:16,910;00:39:20,289;the task at hand--
631;00:39:20,290;00:39:21,660;Casterly Rock.
632;00:39:22,910;00:39:24,699;What was that Ser Davos said
633;00:39:24,700;00:39:28,749;about taking
633;00:39:24,700;00:39:28,749;a knife in the heart
633;00:39:24,700;00:39:28,749;for his people?
634;00:39:28,750;00:39:30,539;Did you notice that?
635;00:39:30,540;00:39:32,999;You must allow them
635;00:39:30,540;00:39:32,999;their flights of fancy.
636;00:39:33,000;00:39:35,160;It's dreary in the North.

638;00:39:51,040;00:39:52,540;Amazing thing to see.
639;00:39:54,040;00:39:57,080;I named them
639;00:39:54,040;00:39:57,080;for my brothers,
639;00:39:54,040;00:39:57,080;Viserys and Rhaegar.
640;00:39:58,200;00:39:59,700;They're both gone now.
641;00:40:02,000;00:40:03,370;You lost two brothers as well.
642;00:40:06,540;00:40:09,410;People thought dragons
642;00:40:06,540;00:40:09,410;were gone forever,
642;00:40:06,540;00:40:09,410;but here they are.
643;00:40:11,160;00:40:14,000;Perhaps we should
643;00:40:11,160;00:40:14,000;all be examining
643;00:40:11,160;00:40:14,000;what we think we know.
644;00:40:19,950;00:40:22,239;You've been talking to Tyrion.
645;00:40:22,240;00:40:24,999;He is my Hand.
646;00:40:25,000;00:40:27,620;He enjoys talking.
646;00:40:25,000;00:40:27,620;We all enjoy what
646;00:40:25,000;00:40:27,620;we're good at.
647;00:40:29,080;00:40:30,580;I don't.
648;00:40:35,580;00:40:38,579;You know I'm not
648;00:40:35,580;00:40:38,579;going to let Cersei
648;00:40:35,580;00:40:38,579;stay on the Iron Throne.
649;00:40:38,580;00:40:39,749;I never expected that you would.
650;00:40:39,750;00:40:40,999;And I haven't changed my mind
651;00:40:41,000;00:40:43,079;about which kingdoms
651;00:40:41,000;00:40:43,079;belong to that throne.
652;00:40:43,080;00:40:44,910;I haven't either.

655;00:40:58,450;00:41:01,450;I will provide for you.

657;00:41:12,450;00:41:16,120;the Army of the Dead?
658;00:41:19,290;00:41:22,000;You'd better
658;00:41:19,290;00:41:22,000;get to work, Jon Snow.

660;00:41:46,660;00:41:48,289;How much do we have?
661;00:41:48,290;00:41:50,369;4,000 bushels, my lady.
662;00:41:50,370;00:41:51,539;What does that mean?
663;00:41:51,540;00:41:53,619;For the current
663;00:41:51,540;00:41:53,619;occupants of the castle,
664;00:41:53,620;00:41:57,289;it's enough food
664;00:41:53,620;00:41:57,289;for a year, perhaps more.
665;00:41:57,290;00:42:00,699;And what's the longest winter
665;00:41:57,290;00:42:00,699;in the past hundred years?
666;00:42:00,700;00:42:03,159;Uh, I'm not entirely certain.
667;00:42:03,160;00:42:04,999;I-I'll check
667;00:42:03,160;00:42:04,999;Maester Luwin's records.
668;00:42:05,000;00:42:08,489;He kept a copy
668;00:42:05,000;00:42:08,489;of every raven scroll.
669;00:42:08,490;00:42:10,619;You're telling me
669;00:42:08,490;00:42:10,619;we don't have enough food,

670;00:42:10,620;00:42:13,830;if the armies of the North
670;00:42:10,620;00:42:13,830;come back to defend Winterfell?
671;00:42:15,080;00:42:17,329;No, my lady, most likely not.
672;00:42:17,330;00:42:19,449;Then we must prepare
672;00:42:17,330;00:42:19,449;for that eventuality.

675;00:42:23,830;00:42:25,789;building up our grain stores
676;00:42:25,790;00:42:28,369;with regular shipments
676;00:42:25,790;00:42:28,369;from every keep in the North.
677;00:42:28,370;00:42:30,659;If we don't

678;00:42:30,660;00:42:32,999;But if the entire North
678;00:42:30,660;00:42:32,999;has to flee to Winterfell,
679;00:42:33,000;00:42:36,699;they won't have enough time
679;00:42:33,000;00:42:36,699;to bring wagonloads
679;00:42:33,000;00:42:36,699;of grain with them.

681;00:42:38,120;00:42:39,910;you'll see to it?
682;00:42:43,700;00:42:46,199;Are they covering those
682;00:42:43,700;00:42:46,199;breastplates in leather?
683;00:42:46,200;00:42:47,579;No, my lady.
684;00:42:47,580;00:42:50,659;Well, shouldn't they be?
684;00:42:47,580;00:42:50,659;Once the real cold comes?
685;00:42:50,660;00:42:52,079;They should, indeed.
686;00:42:52,080;00:42:54,289;Pardon me, my lady.
687;00:42:54,290;00:42:56,870;You there,
687;00:42:54,290;00:42:56,870;why isn't there
687;00:42:54,290;00:42:56,870;leather on these?
688;00:42:58,870;00:43:00,660;Command suits you.
689;00:43:02,370;00:43:04,449;The Northerners
689;00:43:02,370;00:43:04,449;are all facing north,

690;00:43:04,450;00:43:06,539;from beyond the Wall.
691;00:43:06,540;00:43:08,079;So they should be.
692;00:43:08,080;00:43:10,749;I know Cersei
692;00:43:08,080;00:43:10,749;better than anyone here.
693;00:43:10,750;00:43:12,829;If you turn

694;00:43:12,830;00:43:16,749;I only meant to say--
695;00:43:16,750;00:43:20,289;That the woman who
695;00:43:16,750;00:43:20,289;murdered my mother, father,

698;00:43:25,870;00:43:28,159;will defeat the living,
699;00:43:28,160;00:43:30,119;in which case...
700;00:43:30,120;00:43:32,199;all our troubles come to an end,
701;00:43:32,200;00:43:34,579;or life will win out.
702;00:43:34,580;00:43:36,579;And what then?
703;00:43:36,580;00:43:40,580;Don't fight
703;00:43:36,580;00:43:40,580;in the North

708;00:43:57,870;00:44:01,449;and nothing will
708;00:43:57,870;00:44:01,449;surprise you.

740;00:46:25,830;00:46:27,910;It was so beautiful that night.
741;00:46:29,910;00:46:33,910;Snow falling, just like now.
742;00:46:37,160;00:46:39,000;And you were so beautiful...
743;00:46:40,950;00:46:42,750;in your white wedding dress.
744;00:46:46,620;00:46:48,490;I have to go back inside, Bran.
745;00:46:49,870;00:46:51,580;I'll stay a bit longer.
746;00:47:02,870;00:47:05,289;( man coughing in distance )
747;00:47:05,290;00:47:06,830;Hmm.
748;00:47:15,330;00:47:17,160;Hmm.
749;00:47:22,620;00:47:24,489;Does it hurt?
750;00:47:24,490;00:47:27,200;A bit.
750;00:47:24,490;00:47:27,200;Less than before.
751;00:47:29,000;00:47:31,619;The infection no longer
751;00:47:29,000;00:47:31,619;appears to be active.
752;00:47:31,620;00:47:33,199;( sighs )
753;00:47:33,200;00:47:35,039;Unusual.
754;00:47:35,040;00:47:36,489;Unlikely.
755;00:47:36,490;00:47:38,489;One could almost be forgiven
756;00:47:38,490;00:47:42,079;for thinking that
756;00:47:38,490;00:47:42,079;the entire upper layer
756;00:47:38,490;00:47:42,079;of diseased skin was debrided
757;00:47:42,080;00:47:46,449;and the underlying region
757;00:47:42,080;00:47:46,449;treated with some sort
757;00:47:42,080;00:47:46,449;of unguent.
758;00:47:46,450;00:47:49,749;Don't know anything about that.
759;00:47:49,750;00:47:51,829;I just started feeling better.
760;00:47:51,830;00:47:55,490;I assumed it was
760;00:47:51,830;00:47:55,490;the rest that did it.
761;00:47:57,450;00:48:00,079;And the climate.
762;00:48:00,080;00:48:02,039;The climate.
763;00:48:02,040;00:48:03,829;You're free to go, ser.
764;00:48:03,830;00:48:05,869;This chamber is needed
764;00:48:03,830;00:48:05,869;for the infectious,
765;00:48:05,870;00:48:07,579;which you are no longer.
766;00:48:07,580;00:48:11,080;Tarly, I'd like
766;00:48:07,580;00:48:11,080;to speak with you
766;00:48:07,580;00:48:11,080;in my study this evening.
767;00:48:14,040;00:48:15,330;How bad is it?
768;00:48:17,000;00:48:18,370;Suppose I'll find out
768;00:48:17,000;00:48:18,370;this evening.
769;00:48:23,490;00:48:26,199;Where will you go?
769;00:48:23,490;00:48:26,199;( grunts )
770;00:48:26,200;00:48:29,910;I surrendered
770;00:48:26,200;00:48:29,910;to this sickness
770;00:48:26,200;00:48:29,910;the moment I first saw it.
771;00:48:31,370;00:48:34,199;I knew it would kill me
772;00:48:34,200;00:48:36,869;or I'd kill myself
772;00:48:34,200;00:48:36,869;before it could.
773;00:48:36,870;00:48:40,119;Daenerys Stormborn
773;00:48:36,870;00:48:40,119;convinced me otherwise.
774;00:48:40,120;00:48:43,749;The only place for me
774;00:48:40,120;00:48:43,749;is back with her.
775;00:48:43,750;00:48:46,159;I owe her my life.
776;00:48:46,160;00:48:48,749;Her and you.
777;00:48:48,750;00:48:50,949;( chuckles )
778;00:48:50,950;00:48:53,289;Your father saved me
778;00:48:50,950;00:48:53,289;more than once.
779;00:48:53,290;00:48:55,080;It's the least I could do.
780;00:48:56,580;00:48:59,949;Perhaps our paths
780;00:48:56,580;00:48:59,949;will cross again.
781;00:48:59,950;00:49:01,370;I hope they do.
782;00:49:28,490;00:49:31,949;Ebrose:
782;00:49:28,490;00:49:31,949;You treated him?
782;00:49:28,490;00:49:31,949;Yes.
783;00:49:31,950;00:49:34,449;Who told you to treat him?
784;00:49:34,450;00:49:35,789;No one.
785;00:49:35,790;00:49:39,079;Who forbade you, or anyone,
785;00:49:35,790;00:49:39,079;to attempt to treat him?
786;00:49:39,080;00:49:41,789;I seem to remember you.
787;00:49:41,790;00:49:44,620;But you
787;00:49:41,790;00:49:44,620;treated him anyway?
787;00:49:41,790;00:49:44,620;I did, yes.
788;00:49:46,290;00:49:49,409;I forbade it
788;00:49:46,290;00:49:49,409;because it is dangerous
788;00:49:46,290;00:49:49,409;and rarely successful,
789;00:49:49,410;00:49:51,749;especially on
789;00:49:49,410;00:49:51,749;someone of that age.
790;00:49:51,750;00:49:53,949;You could have infected
790;00:49:51,750;00:49:53,949;yourself and others.
791;00:49:53,950;00:49:57,410;You could have devastated
791;00:49:53,950;00:49:57,410;the entire Citadel.
792;00:49:59,700;00:50:01,619;But you didn't.
793;00:50:01,620;00:50:04,239;It's a meticulous,
793;00:50:01,620;00:50:04,239;difficult procedure.
794;00:50:04,240;00:50:07,659;Many maesters
794;00:50:04,240;00:50:07,659;whose chains are
794;00:50:04,240;00:50:07,659;heavy with healing links
795;00:50:07,660;00:50:10,119;have attempted it and failed.
796;00:50:10,120;00:50:12,199;Yet you succeeded.
797;00:50:12,200;00:50:13,330;How?
798;00:50:15,330;00:50:18,620;I read the books
798;00:50:15,330;00:50:18,620;and followed the instructions.
799;00:50:29,000;00:50:31,200;That man is alive
799;00:50:29,000;00:50:31,200;because of you.
800;00:50:33,490;00:50:35,120;You should be proud.
801;00:50:38,200;00:50:40,699;Thank you, Archmaester.
802;00:50:40,700;00:50:41,700;Come here.
803;00:50:45,660;00:50:49,329;All these manuscripts
803;00:50:45,660;00:50:49,329;and scrolls are rotting away.
804;00:50:49,330;00:50:52,000;I need you
804;00:50:49,330;00:50:52,000;to make copies of them.
805;00:50:56,290;00:50:58,370;You were expecting a reward.
806;00:51:00,080;00:51:03,870;Your reward is not being
806;00:51:00,080;00:51:03,870;immediately expelled
806;00:51:00,080;00:51:03,870;from the Citadel.
807;00:51:05,040;00:51:07,039;You'd better get started.
808;00:51:07,040;00:51:08,699;And careful of the paper mites.
809;00:51:08,700;00:51:10,040;They like flesh as well.
810;00:51:17,290;00:51:20,659;We need to find
810;00:51:17,290;00:51:20,659;Euron Greyjoy's fleet
810;00:51:17,290;00:51:20,659;and sink it.
811;00:51:20,660;00:51:24,159;Your Grace,
811;00:51:20,660;00:51:24,159;he's already destroyed
811;00:51:20,660;00:51:24,159;a good portion of our fleet.
812;00:51:24,160;00:51:25,699;To send our
812;00:51:24,160;00:51:25,699;remaining ships
812;00:51:24,160;00:51:25,699;after him--
813;00:51:25,700;00:51:28,370;I'm not talking about
813;00:51:25,700;00:51:28,370;sending our ships after him.
814;00:51:32,200;00:51:33,749;Would you have to go yourself?
815;00:51:33,750;00:51:35,749;Euron's ships could be anywhere
816;00:51:35,750;00:51:37,749;or in more than one place.
817;00:51:37,750;00:51:40,159;You'd be flying around
817;00:51:37,750;00:51:40,159;the open seas alone
818;00:51:40,160;00:51:41,199;for who knows how long.
819;00:51:41,200;00:51:42,829;I wouldn't be alone.
820;00:51:42,830;00:51:45,409;I would have Drogon,
820;00:51:42,830;00:51:45,409;Viserion, and Rhaegal.
821;00:51:45,410;00:51:47,199;What can anyone do to them?
822;00:51:47,200;00:51:49,199;Missandei:
822;00:51:47,200;00:51:49,199;They can still
822;00:51:47,200;00:51:49,199;do something to you.
823;00:51:49,200;00:51:50,999;It only takes one arrow.
824;00:51:51,000;00:51:53,540;It's too great a risk.
824;00:51:51,000;00:51:53,540;You're too important.
825;00:51:55,870;00:51:57,999;What about Casterly Rock?
826;00:51:58,000;00:51:59,949;The Unsullied
826;00:51:58,000;00:51:59,949;will be there soon.
827;00:51:59,950;00:52:02,539;And what will they face?
828;00:52:02,540;00:52:04,949;A difficult situation.
829;00:52:04,950;00:52:07,079;They know we're coming.
830;00:52:07,080;00:52:10,409;Yes. Cersei believes

831;00:52:10,410;00:52:12,039;is to destroy House Lannister.
832;00:52:12,040;00:52:13,790;She will be ready.

838;00:52:32,450;00:52:34,119;They will be ready.

847;00:53:05,700;00:53:08,329;Interesting thing

848;00:53:08,330;00:53:10,239;he built our house up
848;00:53:08,330;00:53:10,239;from near ruin.
849;00:53:10,240;00:53:14,409;He built our army,
849;00:53:10,240;00:53:14,409;he built Casterly Rock
849;00:53:10,240;00:53:14,409;as we know it,
850;00:53:14,410;00:53:16,489;but he didn't build the sewers.
851;00:53:16,490;00:53:18,579;That was beneath him,
852;00:53:18,580;00:53:21,449;so he gave the job
852;00:53:18,580;00:53:21,449;to the lowest person
852;00:53:18,580;00:53:21,449;he could find--
853;00:53:21,450;00:53:22,999;me.
854;00:53:23,000;00:53:24,829;He was right, I was low.
855;00:53:24,830;00:53:26,949;The company I kept, low.
856;00:53:26,950;00:53:28,489;Women, mostly.
857;00:53:28,490;00:53:30,159;They weren't welcome
857;00:53:28,490;00:53:30,159;at the Rock.
858;00:53:30,160;00:53:32,449;Father disapproved
858;00:53:30,160;00:53:32,449;of that sort of behavior.
859;00:53:32,450;00:53:34,079;Couldn't walk them
859;00:53:32,450;00:53:34,079;through the front gates,

861;00:53:35,540;00:53:37,789;so in the process
861;00:53:35,540;00:53:37,789;of building the sewers,
862;00:53:37,790;00:53:40,540;I threw in something for myself.
863;00:53:42,580;00:53:44,579;It was a passage that began

867;00:53:54,540;00:53:58,289;is an impregnable fortress.

869;00:54:00,540;00:54:04,199;But as a good friend of mine
869;00:54:00,540;00:54:04,199;once said,
870;00:54:04,200;00:54:08,159;Give me 10 good men
870;00:54:04,200;00:54:08,159;and I'll impregnate the bitch.
871;00:54:08,160;00:54:10,700;( grunting )
871;00:54:08,160;00:54:10,700;( all shouting )
872;00:54:13,700;00:54:14,910;And so it begins.
873;00:54:21,660;00:54:24,539;They will face the bulk
873;00:54:21,660;00:54:24,539;of the Lannister forces.
874;00:54:24,540;00:54:26,409;They will be outnumbered.
875;00:54:26,410;00:54:28,750;They will have less armor
875;00:54:26,410;00:54:28,750;and fewer weapons.
876;00:54:33,700;00:54:37,489;But my sister's armies
876;00:54:33,700;00:54:37,489;fight for her out of fear.
877;00:54:37,490;00:54:40,449;The Unsullied will be fighting
877;00:54:37,490;00:54:40,449;for something greater.
878;00:54:40,450;00:54:42,449;They will be fighting
878;00:54:40,450;00:54:42,449;for freedom
879;00:54:42,450;00:54:44,239;and the person
879;00:54:42,450;00:54:44,239;who gave it to them.
880;00:54:44,240;00:54:46,749;They will be fighting for you.
881;00:54:46,750;00:54:49,200;And that is why
881;00:54:46,750;00:54:49,200;they will triumph.
882;00:55:05,200;00:55:06,950;( speaking Valyrian )
883;00:55:08,410;00:55:10,620;( Grey Worm speaking Valyrian )
884;00:55:14,660;00:55:17,620;( distant explosions )
885;00:55:35,950;00:55:37,159;Where are they?!
886;00:55:37,160;00:55:39,790;Where are the rest
886;00:55:37,160;00:55:39,790;of the Lannisters?
887;00:56:09,790;00:56:12,830;( men shouting )
888;00:56:34,700;00:56:36,240;( chatter )
889;00:57:02,410;00:57:04,620;( door opens )
890;00:57:08,660;00:57:10,910;It's done.
890;00:57:08,660;00:57:10,910;It is.
891;00:57:12,790;00:57:16,910;And now the rains weep
891;00:57:12,790;00:57:16,910;o'er our halls.
892;00:57:19,240;00:57:20,699;Did we fight well?
893;00:57:20,700;00:57:23,749;Uh, as well
893;00:57:20,700;00:57:23,749;as could be expected.
894;00:57:23,750;00:57:25,869;It was never our forte.
895;00:57:25,870;00:57:27,950;Golden roses, indeed.
896;00:57:29,870;00:57:31,909;Your brother and his new queen
897;00:57:31,910;00:57:34,829;thought you would be
897;00:57:31,910;00:57:34,829;defending Casterly Rock.
898;00:57:34,830;00:57:38,119;The truth is Casterly Rock
898;00:57:34,830;00:57:38,119;isn't worth much anymore.
899;00:57:38,120;00:57:39,699;Well, it is to me,
900;00:57:39,700;00:57:42,039;but my fond childhood memories
901;00:57:42,040;00:57:43,579;won't keep Cersei on the throne.
902;00:57:43,580;00:57:45,699;So you just let them take it?
903;00:57:45,700;00:57:47,749;For now.
903;00:57:45,700;00:57:47,749;They won't
903;00:57:45,700;00:57:47,749;be able to hold it.
904;00:57:47,750;00:57:50,289;Euron Greyjoy's navy
904;00:57:47,750;00:57:50,289;burned their ships,
905;00:57:50,290;00:57:52,289;we emptied the larders
905;00:57:50,290;00:57:52,289;before we left.
906;00:57:52,290;00:57:54,539;Eventually,
906;00:57:52,290;00:57:54,539;they'll be forced
906;00:57:52,290;00:57:54,539;to abandon their position
907;00:57:54,540;00:57:57,949;and march all the way
907;00:57:54,540;00:57:57,949;across Westeros.
908;00:57:57,950;00:58:01,119;And you took your army,
908;00:57:57,950;00:58:01,119;your real army,
909;00:58:01,120;00:58:02,999;and went where they weren't.
910;00:58:03,000;00:58:06,329;As Robb Stark did to me
910;00:58:03,000;00:58:06,329;at Whispering Wood.
911;00:58:06,330;00:58:08,369;There are always
911;00:58:06,330;00:58:08,369;lessons in failures.
912;00:58:08,370;00:58:11,950;Yes. You must be
912;00:58:08,370;00:58:11,950;very wise by now.
913;00:58:13,240;00:58:16,119;My father always said
913;00:58:13,240;00:58:16,119;I was a slow learner.
914;00:58:16,120;00:58:17,869;If he was so clever,
915;00:58:17,870;00:58:19,619;why didn't he take Highgarden
916;00:58:19,620;00:58:23,329;the moment
916;00:58:19,620;00:58:23,329;your gold mines
916;00:58:19,620;00:58:23,329;ran dry?
917;00:58:23,330;00:58:24,869;( scoffs )
918;00:58:24,870;00:58:28,789;I suppose I'll be able
918;00:58:24,870;00:58:28,789;to ask him myself
918;00:58:24,870;00:58:28,789;soon enough.
919;00:58:28,790;00:58:31,870;No more learning
919;00:58:28,790;00:58:31,870;from my mistakes, eh?
920;00:58:34,330;00:58:36,829;How will you do it?
921;00:58:36,830;00:58:39,289;With that sword?
922;00:58:39,290;00:58:41,659;That was Joffrey's sword,
922;00:58:39,290;00:58:41,659;wasn't it?
923;00:58:41,660;00:58:43,999;Not that he ever used it.
924;00:58:44,000;00:58:45,660;What did he call it?
925;00:58:47,290;00:58:49,619;Widow's Wail.
926;00:58:49,620;00:58:51,830;He really was a cunt, wasn't he?
927;00:58:53,450;00:58:58,829;I did unspeakable things
927;00:58:53,450;00:58:58,829;to protect my family.
928;00:58:58,830;00:59:02,869;Or watched them
928;00:58:58,830;00:59:02,869;being done on my orders.
929;00:59:02,870;00:59:06,039;I never lost
929;00:59:02,870;00:59:06,039;a night's sleep over them.
930;00:59:06,040;00:59:08,079;They were necessary.
931;00:59:08,080;00:59:10,119;And whatever
931;00:59:08,080;00:59:10,119;I imagined necessary
932;00:59:10,120;00:59:14,039;for the safety
932;00:59:10,120;00:59:14,039;of House Tyrell, I did.
933;00:59:14,040;00:59:18,660;But your sister
933;00:59:14,040;00:59:18,660;has done things...
934;00:59:20,330;00:59:22,659;I was incapable of imagining.
935;00:59:22,660;00:59:25,489;That was
935;00:59:22,660;00:59:25,489;my prize mistake--
936;00:59:25,490;00:59:28,040;a failure of imagination.
937;00:59:29,370;00:59:31,829;She's a monster,
937;00:59:29,370;00:59:31,829;you do know that?
938;00:59:31,830;00:59:33,999;To you, I'm sure.
939;00:59:34,000;00:59:35,869;To others as well.
940;00:59:35,870;00:59:39,369;But after we've won
940;00:59:35,870;00:59:39,369;and there's no one
940;00:59:35,870;00:59:39,369;left to oppose us,
941;00:59:39,370;00:59:43,699;when people are
941;00:59:39,370;00:59:43,699;living peacefully
941;00:59:39,370;00:59:43,699;in the world she built,
942;00:59:43,700;00:59:47,410;do you really think
942;00:59:43,700;00:59:47,410;they'll wring their hands
942;00:59:43,700;00:59:47,410;over the way she built it?
943;00:59:49,830;00:59:52,039;You love her.
944;00:59:52,040;00:59:53,829;You really do love her.
945;00:59:53,830;00:59:56,289;You poor fool.
946;00:59:56,290;00:59:58,039;She'll be the end of you.
947;00:59:58,040;01:00:00,579;Possibly.
948;01:00:00,580;01:00:02,369;Not much to be gained
949;01:00:02,370;01:00:04,409;from discussing it
949;01:00:02,370;01:00:04,409;with you, though,
949;01:00:02,370;01:00:04,409;is there?
950;01:00:04,410;01:00:07,119;What better person
950;01:00:04,410;01:00:07,119;to discuss it with?
951;01:00:07,120;01:00:09,039;What better guarantee
951;01:00:07,120;01:00:09,039;could you have
952;01:00:09,040;01:00:13,079;that the things you say
952;01:00:09,040;01:00:13,079;will never leave this room?
953;01:00:13,080;01:00:16,119;But perhaps you're right.
954;01:00:16,120;01:00:17,699;If she's driven you this far,
955;01:00:17,700;01:00:20,120;it's gone beyond your control.
956;01:00:21,410;01:00:23,409;Yes.
957;01:00:23,410;01:00:24,870;It has.
958;01:00:25,950;01:00:27,999;She's a disease.
959;01:00:28,000;01:00:30,949;I regret my role
959;01:00:28,000;01:00:30,949;in spreading it.
960;01:00:30,950;01:00:32,539;You will, too.
961;01:00:32,540;01:00:34,290;I think we're done here.
962;01:00:37,700;01:00:38,750;How will it happen?
963;01:00:40,290;01:00:42,199;Cersei had several ideas.
964;01:00:42,200;01:00:43,619;Whipping you through the streets
965;01:00:43,620;01:00:46,289;and beheading you
965;01:00:43,620;01:00:46,289;in front of the Red Keep.
966;01:00:46,290;01:00:50,120;Flaying you alive
966;01:00:46,290;01:00:50,120;and hanging you from
966;01:00:46,290;01:00:50,120;the walls of King's Landing.
967;01:00:53,290;01:00:55,080;I talked her out of those.
968;01:01:12,330;01:01:13,749;Will there be pain?
969;01:01:13,750;01:01:16,329;No. I made sure
969;01:01:13,750;01:01:16,329;of that.
970;01:01:16,330;01:01:17,660;That's good.
971;01:01:30,450;01:01:32,450;I'd hate to die like your son.
972;01:01:33,660;01:01:35,119;Clawing at my neck,
973;01:01:35,120;01:01:37,999;foam and bile spilling
973;01:01:35,120;01:01:37,999;from my mouth,
974;01:01:38,000;01:01:41,829;eyes bloodred, skin purple.
975;01:01:41,830;01:01:44,199;Must have been horrible for you,
976;01:01:44,200;01:01:47,659;as a Kingsguard, as a father.
977;01:01:47,660;01:01:50,239;It was horrible enough for me.
978;01:01:50,240;01:01:52,909;A shocking scene.
979;01:01:52,910;01:01:55,700;Not at all what I intended.
980;01:01:57,660;01:02:02,240;You see, I had never seen
980;01:01:57,660;01:02:02,240;the poison work before.
981;01:02:07,200;01:02:09,369;Tell Cersei.
982;01:02:09,370;01:02:11,830;I want her to know it was me.
