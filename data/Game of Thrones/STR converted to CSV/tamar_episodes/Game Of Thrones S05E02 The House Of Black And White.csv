2;00:01:53,348;00:01:55,749;We're going to Braavos!
3;00:02:01,688;00:02:05,292;In the old times, whenever
3;00:02:01,688;00:02:05,292;Braavos stood in danger,
4;00:02:05,659;00:02:08,761;the Titan would step
4;00:02:05,659;00:02:08,761;with fire in his eyes.
5;00:02:09,096;00:02:12,565;He'd wade into the sea
5;00:02:09,096;00:02:12,565;and smash the enemies.
6;00:02:13,667;00:02:15,034;He's just a statue.
7;00:02:20,340;00:02:22,007;Don't be afraid.
8;00:02:22,275;00:02:24,176;He's announcing our arrival.
9;00:02:26,079;00:02:27,847;I'm not afraid.
10;00:03:36,614;00:03:38,248;The House of Black and White.
11;00:03:38,616;00:03:41,684;This is where you'll find
11;00:03:38,616;00:03:41,684;the man you seek.
12;00:03:47,358;00:03:49,359;Here I leave you.
13;00:03:56,967;00:03:58,668;Thank you for bringing me.

14;00:03:59,003;00:04:01,137;would have done the same.

20;00:04:59,661;00:05:01,929;Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.
21;00:05:05,500;00:05:07,401;No one here by that name.

23;00:05:10,205;00:05:13,407;I crossed the Narrow Sea.
23;00:05:10,205;00:05:13,407;I have nowhere else to go.
24;00:05:13,709;00:05:15,275;You have everywhere else to go.
25;00:05:15,443;00:05:17,277;But wait--

45;00:06:56,341;00:06:58,342;Must be good food
45;00:06:56,341;00:06:58,342;if it's crowded.
46;00:07:03,014;00:07:04,781;Ale?
47;00:07:12,389;00:07:13,824;Ale?
48;00:07:21,799;00:07:24,334;Before we left, a maester
48;00:07:21,799;00:07:24,334;gave you a raven scroll.
49;00:07:27,070;00:07:29,472;You are becoming
49;00:07:27,070;00:07:29,472;an observant young lady.
50;00:07:29,840;00:07:32,342;My mother used to say,
50;00:07:29,840;00:07:32,342;Dark wings, dark words.
51;00:07:32,676;00:07:36,078;An old saying.
51;00:07:32,676;00:07:36,078;Inaccurate in this case.
52;00:07:37,381;00:07:38,948;Excuse me.
53;00:07:39,216;00:07:40,717;So it was good news?
54;00:07:41,051;00:07:43,018;My marriage proposal
54;00:07:41,051;00:07:43,018;has been accepted.
55;00:07:43,419;00:07:45,859;I thought you still mourned the
55;00:07:43,419;00:07:45,859;death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.
56;00:07:45,989;00:07:47,489;Ale?
57;00:07:47,758;00:07:49,558;I'll have some.
58;00:07:53,163;00:07:54,163;My lady.
59;00:07:55,498;00:07:56,531;What is it?
60;00:07:56,767;00:07:58,533;Sansa Stark.
60;00:07:56,767;00:07:58,533;Don't look.
61;00:08:00,035;00:08:01,169;You sure?
62;00:08:01,504;00:08:02,825;She's dyed her hair,
62;00:08:01,504;00:08:02,825;but it's her.
63;00:08:02,938;00:08:04,218;She's sitting
63;00:08:02,938;00:08:04,218;with Petyr Baelish.
64;00:08:04,274;00:08:05,307;Littlefinger?
65;00:08:05,575;00:08:06,975;A bunch of knights with him.
66;00:08:07,343;00:08:09,043;A bunch? What's a bunch, Podrick?
66;00:08:07,343;00:08:09,043;Six? 20?
67;00:08:09,279;00:08:11,212;10, I think.
67;00:08:09,279;00:08:11,212;Too many.
68;00:08:11,547;00:08:13,187;My lady, I don't think
68;00:08:11,547;00:08:13,187;this is the right--
69;00:08:13,215;00:08:15,517;Ready the horses.
69;00:08:13,215;00:08:15,517;We only have one horse.
70;00:08:15,718;00:08:17,451;Find more.
71;00:08:23,392;00:08:24,926;Do you like the taste?
72;00:08:25,261;00:08:27,162;I don't see what
72;00:08:25,261;00:08:27,162;all the fuss is about.
73;00:08:27,429;00:08:30,498;Why do men love it so much?
74;00:08:30,766;00:08:32,533;It gives some men courage.
75;00:08:32,768;00:08:34,769;Does it give you courage?
76;00:08:37,739;00:08:40,040;That's far enough.
77;00:08:40,309;00:08:43,377;Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa.
78;00:08:43,645;00:08:45,513;My name is Brienne of Tarth.
79;00:08:45,814;00:08:47,981;We've met with Renly Baratheon.
80;00:08:49,250;00:08:51,185;What did he say about you?
81;00:08:51,552;00:08:56,223;He said, Your loyalty
81;00:08:51,552;00:08:56,223;came free of charge.
82;00:08:58,159;00:09:00,479;Someone appears to have paid
82;00:08:58,159;00:09:00,479;quite a bit for it since then.
83;00:09:13,907;00:09:16,509;Lady Sansa,
84;00:09:16,777;00:09:18,478;before your mother's death,
85;00:09:18,746;00:09:20,780;I was her sworn sword.
86;00:09:21,148;00:09:23,916;I gave my word I would
86;00:09:21,148;00:09:23,916;find you and protect you.
87;00:09:24,284;00:09:27,286;I will shield your back
87;00:09:24,284;00:09:27,286;and keep your counsel
88;00:09:27,620;00:09:30,022;and give my life
88;00:09:27,620;00:09:30,022;for yours if need be.
89;00:09:30,357;00:09:33,326;I swear it by the old
89;00:09:30,357;00:09:33,326;gods and the new.
90;00:09:34,761;00:09:36,562;Please, Lady Brienne,
91;00:09:36,830;00:09:38,397;no need for such formality.
92;00:09:38,698;00:09:40,833;You were Catelyn Stark's
92;00:09:38,698;00:09:40,833;sworn sword?
93;00:09:41,100;00:09:43,034;I was.
93;00:09:41,100;00:09:43,034;Strange.
94;00:09:43,370;00:09:44,503;I knew Cat from the time
94;00:09:43,370;00:09:44,503;we were children.
95;00:09:44,771;00:09:46,405;She never mentioned you.
96;00:09:46,673;00:09:48,374;It was after Renly's murder.
97;00:09:48,541;00:09:49,675;Ah, yes.
98;00:09:49,976;00:09:51,477;You were accused of killing him.
99;00:09:51,811;00:09:54,212;I tried to save him.
99;00:09:51,811;00:09:54,212;But you were accused.
100;00:09:54,514;00:09:56,281;By men who didn't see
100;00:09:54,514;00:09:56,281;what happened.
101;00:09:56,515;00:09:57,983;And what did happen?
102;00:10:02,454;00:10:04,589;He was murdered by a shadow.
103;00:10:04,957;00:10:07,292;A shadow with the face
103;00:10:04,957;00:10:07,292;of Stannis Baratheon.
104;00:10:07,493;00:10:10,561;A shadow?
105;00:10:10,829;00:10:14,164;With the face--
106;00:10:15,634;00:10:17,535;This woman swore
106;00:10:15,634;00:10:17,535;to protect Renly.
107;00:10:17,736;00:10:18,903;She failed.
108;00:10:19,304;00:10:22,339;She swore to protect your mother.
108;00:10:19,304;00:10:22,339;She failed.
109;00:10:22,808;00:10:26,577;Why would I want somebody with your
109;00:10:22,808;00:10:26,577;history of failure guarding Lady Sansa?
110;00:10:26,912;00:10:28,745;Why should you have
110;00:10:26,912;00:10:28,745;any say in her affairs?
111;00:10:29,014;00:10:30,314;Because I am her uncle.
112;00:10:30,748;00:10:33,650;I married her Aunt Lysa shortly
112;00:10:30,748;00:10:33,650;before my beloved's untimely death.
113;00:10:33,985;00:10:36,553;We're family now
113;00:10:33,985;00:10:36,553;and you are an outsider.
114;00:10:37,022;00:10:40,424;Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experience
114;00:10:37,022;00:10:40,424;has made me wary of outsiders.
115;00:10:40,758;00:10:43,560;Lady Sansa, if we can
115;00:10:40,758;00:10:43,560;have a word alone--
116;00:10:43,728;00:10:45,028;No.
117;00:10:45,362;00:10:46,802;Please, my lady.
117;00:10:45,362;00:10:46,802;If I could explain--
118;00:10:46,997;00:10:49,332;I saw you at Joffrey's
118;00:10:46,997;00:10:49,332;wedding bowing to the king.
119;00:10:49,667;00:10:52,903;Neither of us
119;00:10:49,667;00:10:52,903;wanted to be there.
120;00:10:53,203;00:10:54,638;Sometimes we don't
120;00:10:53,203;00:10:54,638;have a choice.
121;00:10:54,872;00:10:56,940;And sometimes we do.
122;00:10:58,375;00:11:01,177;You should leave.
123;00:11:01,578;00:11:03,978;We don't want our new friend
123;00:11:01,578;00:11:03,978;wandering the countryside alone.
124;00:11:04,248;00:11:05,815;The roads in these parts
124;00:11:04,248;00:11:05,815;aren't safe.
125;00:11:06,050;00:11:07,083;Why don't you stay?
126;00:11:16,560;00:11:18,594;The man asked you
126;00:11:16,560;00:11:18,594;to stay--
127;00:11:21,130;00:11:23,866;Hyah! Hyah!
128;00:11:31,475;00:11:32,708;Hyah! Hyah!
129;00:11:33,042;00:11:35,743;After her!
130;00:11:47,290;00:11:49,124;Yah! Hah!
130;00:11:47,290;00:11:49,124;Oh!
131;00:12:06,509;00:12:08,509;Stop! Stop!
131;00:12:06,509;00:12:08,509;I'll take him!
132;00:12:09,811;00:12:11,845;Podrick!
133;00:12:12,114;00:12:14,148;Hold on to her!
134;00:12:16,985;00:12:18,619;Take her!
135;00:12:34,636;00:12:35,903;Keep moving!
136;00:12:47,481;00:12:50,116;Stop! Stop! Stop!
137;00:12:50,317;00:12:52,185;Stop! Stop!
138;00:12:55,322;00:12:57,657;That's a good boy.
138;00:12:55,322;00:12:57,657;Come on. Come on.
139;00:12:59,626;00:13:02,361;No, no, no, stop!
140;00:13:22,082;00:13:24,783;I guess that means
140;00:13:22,082;00:13:24,783;you're unarmed.
141;00:13:25,085;00:13:26,851;Down, Podrick! Down!
142;00:13:46,405;00:13:49,507;Podrick.
142;00:13:46,405;00:13:49,507;Yes, my lady?
143;00:13:49,741;00:13:51,709;You can stand now.
144;00:13:51,910;00:13:53,511;Yes, my lady.
145;00:13:56,948;00:13:59,217;Sansa Stark?
146;00:13:59,551;00:14:01,785;Wary of strangers,
146;00:13:59,551;00:14:01,785;as she should be.
147;00:14:02,187;00:14:04,187;I saw her riding on the East
147;00:14:02,187;00:14:04,187;Road with Littlefinger.
148;00:14:04,222;00:14:05,422;We'll follow them.
149;00:14:05,790;00:14:09,893;My lady, if both Stark girls
149;00:14:05,790;00:14:09,893;refused your service,
150;00:14:10,194;00:14:11,595;maybe you're released
150;00:14:10,194;00:14:11,595;from your vow.
151;00:14:11,963;00:14:14,031;I swore to their mother
151;00:14:11,963;00:14:14,031;I would protect those girls.
152;00:14:14,365;00:14:15,265;But if they don't want
152;00:14:14,365;00:14:15,265;your protection--
153;00:14:15,634;00:14:17,300;Do you think she's safe
153;00:14:15,634;00:14:17,300;with Littlefinger?
154;00:14:19,803;00:14:21,471;No, my lady.
155;00:14:21,705;00:14:23,373;Get your horse.
156;00:14:33,050;00:14:34,784;A summons from the queen.
157;00:14:53,069;00:14:55,904;There are only two
157;00:14:53,069;00:14:55,904;like it in the world.
158;00:14:56,273;00:14:58,374;The one I'm wearing,
158;00:14:56,273;00:14:58,374;the one I gave to Myrcella.
159;00:14:58,741;00:15:01,243;It's a threat.
159;00:14:58,741;00:15:01,243;Of course it's a threat.
160;00:15:01,511;00:15:03,945;Our daughter's alone in Dorne
161;00:15:04,281;00:15:07,516;surrounded by people
161;00:15:04,281;00:15:07,516;who hate our family.
162;00:15:07,750;00:15:09,317;It's a threat.
163;00:15:11,120;00:15:12,353;No note?
164;00:15:12,755;00:15:15,623;They blame us for the death
164;00:15:12,755;00:15:15,623;of Oberyn and his sister
165;00:15:16,092;00:15:18,794;and every other tragedy that's
165;00:15:16,092;00:15:18,794;befallen their cursed country.
166;00:15:19,195;00:15:21,436;I will burn their cities to
166;00:15:19,195;00:15:21,436;the ground if they touch her.
167;00:15:21,597;00:15:22,798;Softer.
167;00:15:21,597;00:15:22,798;What?
168;00:15:22,999;00:15:24,666;Not so loud.
169;00:15:25,101;00:15:27,134;Our daughter's in danger and you're
169;00:15:25,101;00:15:27,134;worried I'm speaking too loudly?
170;00:15:27,469;00:15:29,537;The world can't know
170;00:15:27,469;00:15:29,537;she's our daughter.
171;00:15:31,139;00:15:33,007;Then don't call her
171;00:15:31,139;00:15:33,007;your daughter.
172;00:15:33,309;00:15:34,909;You've never been
172;00:15:33,309;00:15:34,909;a father to her.
173;00:15:35,377;00:15:37,245;If I was a father to any of my children,
173;00:15:35,377;00:15:37,245;they'd be stoned in the street.
174;00:15:37,546;00:15:39,547;And what has
174;00:15:37,546;00:15:39,547;your caution brought?
175;00:15:41,283;00:15:44,018;Our eldest child murdered
175;00:15:41,283;00:15:44,018;at his own wedding.
176;00:15:44,352;00:15:46,553;Our only daughter
176;00:15:44,352;00:15:46,553;shipped off to Dorne.
177;00:15:48,023;00:15:49,156;Our baby boy set to marry
178;00:15:49,490;00:15:51,959;that smirking whore
178;00:15:49,490;00:15:51,959;from Highgarden.
179;00:16:00,968;00:16:02,302;I'm going to make things better.
180;00:16:02,637;00:16:03,958;You've never made
180;00:16:02,637;00:16:03,958;anything better.
181;00:16:04,138;00:16:05,205;I'm going to Dorne
182;00:16:05,506;00:16:07,441;and I'm bringing
182;00:16:05,506;00:16:07,441;our daughter home.
183;00:16:07,808;00:16:10,110;You can't just ask Prince Doran
184;00:16:10,345;00:16:12,246;to give her back.
185;00:16:12,513;00:16:13,714;She's promised to his son.
186;00:16:14,014;00:16:16,482;I'm not going
186;00:16:14,014;00:16:16,482;to ask him anything.
187;00:16:16,851;00:16:18,851;You go down there with an
187;00:16:16,851;00:16:18,851;army, it's an act of war.
188;00:16:18,853;00:16:20,353;No army.
189;00:16:20,687;00:16:22,488;Do you know where
189;00:16:20,687;00:16:22,488;they're keeping her?
190;00:16:25,860;00:16:27,827;Oberyn mentioned
190;00:16:25,860;00:16:27,827;the Water Gardens.
191;00:16:28,028;00:16:29,763;I'll find her.
192;00:16:32,399;00:16:34,500;Is there anything else,
192;00:16:32,399;00:16:34,500;Your Grace?
193;00:16:36,436;00:16:39,238;You're going to Dorne?
194;00:16:40,374;00:16:43,609;A one-handed man alone?
195;00:16:44,944;00:16:46,712;I never said I was going alone.
196;00:16:55,088;00:16:57,422;No sunflowers.
196;00:16:55,088;00:16:57,422;I don't like yellow.
197;00:16:57,757;00:16:59,992;Roses are very nice.
197;00:16:57,757;00:16:59,992;Definitely roses.
198;00:17:00,260;00:17:01,660;And music.
198;00:17:00,260;00:17:01,660;I adore music.
199;00:17:01,928;00:17:03,762;But no flutes.
199;00:17:01,928;00:17:03,762;I hate flutes.
200;00:17:04,130;00:17:05,931;We can have a harp if you
200;00:17:04,130;00:17:05,931;like, but no flutes.
201;00:17:06,265;00:17:08,466;Then there's the food. Food
201;00:17:06,265;00:17:08,466;is the most important thing.
202;00:17:08,734;00:17:10,735;Don't you agree? We're
202;00:17:08,734;00:17:10,735;going to need pigeon pies.
203;00:17:11,103;00:17:14,005;That's what they eat in
203;00:17:11,103;00:17:14,005;the capital, don't they?
204;00:17:14,206;00:17:15,707;Don't they?
205;00:17:17,242;00:17:18,576;Don't who?
206;00:17:18,911;00:17:21,612;People eat pigeon
206;00:17:18,911;00:17:21,612;pie in the capital.
207;00:17:23,115;00:17:24,481;They certainly do, my dear.
208;00:17:24,716;00:17:26,951;They certainly do.
209;00:17:27,252;00:17:29,220;It's a fine place, isn't it?
210;00:17:29,421;00:17:31,022;A fine place.
211;00:17:31,290;00:17:33,057;I never thought I'd end up
212;00:17:33,391;00:17:35,993;settling down
212;00:17:33,391;00:17:35,993;in a place like this.
213;00:17:36,261;00:17:39,363;You won't.
213;00:17:36,261;00:17:39,363;Pardon?
214;00:17:39,664;00:17:41,264;We won't get to live
214;00:17:39,664;00:17:41,264;at Stokeworth.
215;00:17:41,733;00:17:44,253;When Mother dies, my sister gets
215;00:17:41,733;00:17:44,253;the castle because she's older.
216;00:17:44,302;00:17:46,236;Oh.
216;00:17:44,302;00:17:46,236;She hates me.
217;00:17:46,604;00:17:48,672;She calls me mean names
217;00:17:46,604;00:17:48,672;and sometimes even still
218;00:17:49,006;00:17:51,642;she pulls my hair
218;00:17:49,006;00:17:51,642;when Mother's not looking.
219;00:17:53,244;00:17:54,978;You know what I think?
220;00:17:55,279;00:17:57,214;I think you're a good person.
221;00:17:57,514;00:17:59,482;And your sister
221;00:17:57,514;00:17:59,482;is a mean person.
222;00:17:59,650;00:18:01,084;She is.
223;00:18:02,987;00:18:04,821;I've been all over the world,
224;00:18:05,122;00:18:06,923;and if there's one thing
224;00:18:05,122;00:18:06,923;I've learned,
225;00:18:07,191;00:18:09,960;it's that meanness comes around.
226;00:18:10,194;00:18:11,794;People like your sister,
227;00:18:12,162;00:18:15,264;they always get what's coming
227;00:18:12,162;00:18:15,264;to them eventually.
228;00:18:15,499;00:18:17,467;One way or another.
229;00:18:20,671;00:18:22,705;Who's that?
230;00:18:25,141;00:18:26,976;Jaime fucking Lannister.
231;00:18:29,145;00:18:31,713;Ser Jaime.
231;00:18:29,145;00:18:31,713;Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
232;00:18:33,483;00:18:35,584;I was very sorry
232;00:18:33,483;00:18:35,584;to hear about your father.
233;00:18:35,785;00:18:37,219;Thank you.
234;00:18:37,487;00:18:40,189;This is my betrothed Lollys.
235;00:18:42,192;00:18:43,725;A pleasure.
236;00:18:45,895;00:18:47,562;Run along, love.
237;00:18:53,803;00:18:56,137;Beautiful young bride
237;00:18:53,803;00:18:56,137;you've chosen.
238;00:18:56,472;00:18:58,306;When were you planning
238;00:18:56,472;00:18:58,306;on getting married?
239;00:18:58,641;00:19:00,541;Just get on with it.
239;00:18:58,641;00:19:00,541;On with what?
240;00:19:00,809;00:19:02,443;What you're here for.
241;00:19:02,912;00:19:05,079;There's no way this little visit could
241;00:19:02,912;00:19:05,079;possibly mean anything good for me.
242;00:19:05,347;00:19:07,581;It's very good for you.
243;00:19:19,528;00:19:22,029;Lollys will be marrying
243;00:19:19,528;00:19:22,029;Ser Willis Bracken.
244;00:19:22,196;00:19:23,330;Mmm.
245;00:19:23,598;00:19:26,199;We made a deal,
245;00:19:23,598;00:19:26,199;your sister and I.
246;00:19:26,668;00:19:29,169;I would have advised against that.
246;00:19:26,668;00:19:29,169;How is this good for me?
247;00:19:29,671;00:19:32,005;'Cause you're going to come with me
247;00:19:29,671;00:19:32,005;and help me with something important.
248;00:19:32,441;00:19:35,542;And when we return, I'm going
248;00:19:32,441;00:19:35,542;to give you a much better girl
249;00:19:35,776;00:19:37,544;and a much better castle.
250;00:19:40,248;00:19:42,515;Return from where?
251;00:19:42,783;00:19:44,952;As far south as south goes.
252;00:19:58,432;00:20:01,968;My future queen.
253;00:20:19,919;00:20:22,121;The prince does not wish
253;00:20:19,919;00:20:22,121;to be disturbed.
254;00:20:22,422;00:20:24,022;Remove yourself from my path
255;00:20:24,390;00:20:26,191;or I'll take that longaxe
255;00:20:24,390;00:20:26,191;and I'll shove it--
256;00:20:26,425;00:20:27,626;Captain.
257;00:20:29,328;00:20:30,762;Let her pass.
258;00:20:34,801;00:20:37,002;Your brother was murdered
259;00:20:37,303;00:20:39,204;and you sit here
259;00:20:37,303;00:20:39,204;in the Water Gardens
260;00:20:39,505;00:20:41,639;staring at the sky
260;00:20:39,505;00:20:41,639;and doing nothing.
261;00:20:41,974;00:20:44,442;Oberyn was slain
261;00:20:41,974;00:20:44,442;during a trial by combat.
262;00:20:44,743;00:20:45,910;By law, that is not murder.
263;00:20:46,278;00:20:48,480;Your brother.
263;00:20:46,278;00:20:48,480;You don't have to remind me.
264;00:20:48,847;00:20:51,282;He was my brother long before
264;00:20:48,847;00:20:51,282;he was anything to you.
265;00:20:51,583;00:20:53,418;What will you do
265;00:20:51,583;00:20:53,418;about his death?
266;00:20:53,752;00:20:55,786;I will bury him.
266;00:20:53,752;00:20:55,786;I will mourn for him.
267;00:20:56,154;00:20:58,656;And then?
267;00:20:56,154;00:20:58,656;You would have me go to war?
268;00:20:58,991;00:21:00,157;The whole country
268;00:20:58,991;00:21:00,157;would have you go to war.
269;00:21:00,526;00:21:03,093;Then we are lucky the whole
269;00:21:00,526;00:21:03,093;country does not decide.
270;00:21:05,531;00:21:07,197;The Sand Snakes are with me.
271;00:21:07,499;00:21:08,860;They have the love
271;00:21:07,499;00:21:08,860;of their people.
272;00:21:09,034;00:21:11,435;They will avenge their
272;00:21:09,034;00:21:11,435;father while you sit here
273;00:21:11,703;00:21:14,371;in your chair doing nothing.
274;00:21:18,209;00:21:19,910;Oberyn is dead
275;00:21:20,311;00:21:23,780;and this Lannister girl skips
275;00:21:20,311;00:21:23,780;about the Water Gardens
276;00:21:24,115;00:21:27,884;eating our food,
276;00:21:24,115;00:21:27,884;breathing our air.
277;00:21:28,319;00:21:30,887;How many of your brothers and
277;00:21:28,319;00:21:30,887;sisters do they have to kill?
278;00:21:32,489;00:21:34,157;Let me have her.
279;00:21:36,226;00:21:39,729;Let me send her to Cersei
279;00:21:36,226;00:21:39,729;one finger at a time.
280;00:21:41,465;00:21:43,366;I loved my brother.
281;00:21:43,634;00:21:45,668;And you made him very happy.
282;00:21:46,036;00:21:48,737;For that, you will always
282;00:21:46,036;00:21:48,737;have a place in my heart.
283;00:21:50,307;00:21:54,077;But we do not mutilate
283;00:21:50,307;00:21:54,077;little girls for vengeance.
284;00:21:54,244;00:21:55,744;Not here.
285;00:21:55,979;00:21:57,680;Not while I rule.
286;00:21:59,149;00:22:01,016;And how long will that be?
287;00:22:17,200;00:22:19,234;The Unsullied
287;00:22:17,200;00:22:19,234;are too conspicuous.
288;00:22:19,569;00:22:22,204;Anyone can see you coming
288;00:22:19,569;00:22:22,204;from a mile off.
289;00:22:22,572;00:22:24,532;Of course you haven't found
289;00:22:22,572;00:22:24,532;any Sons of the Harpy.
290;00:22:24,707;00:22:26,641;You haven't, have you?
291;00:22:28,377;00:22:31,480;My Second Sons,
291;00:22:28,377;00:22:31,480;on the other hand,
292;00:22:31,747;00:22:34,549;they drink, they whore,
293;00:22:34,783;00:22:36,350;fight in the streets,
294;00:22:36,551;00:22:37,885;they blend in.
295;00:22:38,186;00:22:40,187;They overhear things in taverns,
296;00:22:40,589;00:22:43,825;follow people from the taverns
296;00:22:40,589;00:22:43,825;to nice, quiet alleys,
297;00:22:44,059;00:22:46,127;break a few fingers,
298;00:22:46,394;00:22:48,129;overhear a few more things.
299;00:22:49,598;00:22:51,065;Before you know it...
300;00:23:10,752;00:23:13,086;No one here.
301;00:23:13,254;00:23:14,487;We go.
302;00:23:14,756;00:23:17,290;In a hurry?
302;00:23:14,756;00:23:17,290;You're afraid?
303;00:23:17,558;00:23:19,425;Unsullied fear nothing.
304;00:23:19,593;00:23:21,361;Right.
305;00:23:21,595;00:23:23,329;That's your problem.
306;00:23:23,631;00:23:25,665;You understood fear
306;00:23:23,631;00:23:25,665;once long ago,
307;00:23:25,966;00:23:27,534;but you've forgotten
307;00:23:25,966;00:23:27,534;what it means.
308;00:23:27,801;00:23:31,271;Someone who's forgotten fear
309;00:23:31,505;00:23:32,838;has forgotten how to hide.
310;00:23:41,748;00:23:43,849;Fear is useful that way.
311;00:24:08,508;00:24:12,043;Sons of the Harpy, they want to
311;00:24:08,508;00:24:12,043;put a collar back on my neck.
312;00:24:12,278;00:24:13,412;On all of our necks.
313;00:24:13,713;00:24:15,279;Please, Your Grace,
313;00:24:13,713;00:24:15,279;you must kill him.
314;00:24:15,514;00:24:16,715;It would send a message.
315;00:24:17,116;00:24:19,483;I think you should exercise
315;00:24:17,116;00:24:19,483;restraint, Your Grace.
316;00:24:19,885;00:24:22,353;Why? - For one thing, he may have
316;00:24:19,885;00:24:22,353;valuable information.
317;00:24:22,722;00:24:25,456;The Son of the Harpy has no
317;00:24:22,722;00:24:25,456;more valuable information.
318;00:24:25,691;00:24:26,557;How do you know that?
319;00:24:26,826;00:24:28,860;Because I questioned him.
320;00:24:29,195;00:24:30,796;And the
320;00:24:29,195;00:24:30,796;information you did get,
321;00:24:31,062;00:24:32,702;he is young and poor.
321;00:24:31,062;00:24:32,702;He is born free.
322;00:24:32,797;00:24:34,832;Why should he want to bring back slavery?
322;00:24:32,797;00:24:34,832;What did it do for him?
323;00:24:35,166;00:24:36,367;Perhaps the only thing
323;00:24:35,166;00:24:36,367;that gave him pride
324;00:24:36,735;00:24:38,302;was knowing that there was
324;00:24:36,735;00:24:38,302;someone lower than he was.
325;00:24:38,503;00:24:39,737;They pay him.
326;00:24:40,038;00:24:41,438;Great families
326;00:24:40,038;00:24:41,438;afraid to do a thing.
327;00:24:41,707;00:24:43,307;They pay poor man
327;00:24:41,707;00:24:43,307;to do it for them.
328;00:24:43,709;00:24:45,109;And how do you know this?
328;00:24:43,709;00:24:45,109;Everyone know this.
329;00:24:45,510;00:24:47,510;I don't know it and I'm the
329;00:24:45,510;00:24:47,510;head of a great family.
330;00:24:47,578;00:24:49,819;We do not know what
330;00:24:47,578;00:24:49,819;this man did or didn't do.
331;00:24:50,081;00:24:53,550;Give him a trial at least.
331;00:24:50,081;00:24:53,550;A fair trial.
332;00:24:53,852;00:24:55,685;Show all the citizens of Meereen
333;00:24:56,054;00:24:57,721;that you're better than
333;00:24:56,054;00:24:57,721;those who would depose you.
334;00:24:57,989;00:24:59,623;Teach them a better way.
335;00:25:00,024;00:25:01,944;I do not know the place
335;00:25:00,024;00:25:01,944;from where Old Ser comes.
336;00:25:02,227;00:25:05,161;Things maybe are
336;00:25:02,227;00:25:05,161;different there, I hope.
337;00:25:05,396;00:25:07,397;But here in Meereen,
338;00:25:07,698;00:25:10,233;before Daenerys Stormborn,
338;00:25:07,698;00:25:10,233;they own us.
339;00:25:10,534;00:25:12,435;So we learn much about them
340;00:25:12,703;00:25:14,671;or we do not live long.
341;00:25:14,938;00:25:17,039;They teach me what they are.
342;00:25:17,408;00:25:21,477;Mercy, fair trial--
342;00:25:17,408;00:25:21,477;these mean nothing to them.
343;00:25:21,745;00:25:23,946;All they understand is blood.
344;00:25:29,219;00:25:31,087;Thank you
344;00:25:29,219;00:25:31,087;all for your counsel.
345;00:25:39,429;00:25:41,830;Your Grace, a word,
345;00:25:39,429;00:25:41,830;please, I beg you.
346;00:25:42,131;00:25:44,600;About what?
346;00:25:42,131;00:25:44,600;About your father.
347;00:25:44,934;00:25:46,935;About the Mad King.
347;00:25:44,934;00:25:46,935;The Mad King?
348;00:25:47,270;00:25:48,404;You're here to remind me
348;00:25:47,270;00:25:48,404;of my enemies' lies?
349;00:25:48,638;00:25:49,938;Consider me reminded.
350;00:25:50,273;00:25:53,675;Your Grace, I served
350;00:25:50,273;00:25:53,675;in his Kingsguard.
351;00:25:53,976;00:25:55,777;I was at his side
351;00:25:53,976;00:25:55,777;from the first.
352;00:25:56,045;00:25:58,413;Your enemies did not lie.
353;00:25:59,916;00:26:01,616;Go on.
354;00:26:03,485;00:26:06,021;When the people rose
354;00:26:03,485;00:26:06,021;in revolt against him,
355;00:26:06,388;00:26:09,524;your father set their towns
355;00:26:06,388;00:26:09,524;and castles aflame.
356;00:26:09,891;00:26:12,893;He murdered sons
356;00:26:09,891;00:26:12,893;in front of their fathers.
357;00:26:13,228;00:26:15,262;He burned men alive
357;00:26:13,228;00:26:15,262;with wildfire
358;00:26:15,564;00:26:18,399;and laughed as they screamed.
359;00:26:18,734;00:26:21,969;And his efforts
359;00:26:18,734;00:26:21,969;to stamp out dissent
360;00:26:22,404;00:26:26,440;led to rebellion that killed
360;00:26:22,404;00:26:26,440;every Targaryen except two.
361;00:26:26,641;00:26:28,843;I'm not my father.
362;00:26:29,144;00:26:32,446;No, Your Grace.
362;00:26:29,144;00:26:32,446;Thank the gods.
363;00:26:32,948;00:26:36,851;But the Mad King gave his enemies the
363;00:26:32,948;00:26:36,851;justice he thought they deserved.
364;00:26:37,252;00:26:40,754;And each time, it made him
364;00:26:37,252;00:26:40,754;feel powerful and right.
365;00:26:42,090;00:26:43,256;Until the very end.
366;00:26:48,429;00:26:50,464;I will not have the Son
366;00:26:48,429;00:26:50,464;of the Harpy executed
367;00:26:50,698;00:26:52,165;without a fair trial.
368;00:26:55,536;00:26:57,771;Your Grace.
369;00:27:06,646;00:27:08,614;There's a bug.
370;00:27:08,849;00:27:10,116;Yes, best be careful.
371;00:27:10,484;00:27:12,685;You might accidently
371;00:27:10,484;00:27:12,685;consume some solid food.
372;00:27:12,987;00:27:14,820;When I agreed to come with you,
373;00:27:15,122;00:27:17,490;did I misrepresent
373;00:27:15,122;00:27:17,490;my intentions?
374;00:27:22,061;00:27:24,864;Besides, what else
374;00:27:22,061;00:27:24,864;is there for me to do
375;00:27:25,131;00:27:26,899;inside this fucking box?
376;00:27:27,233;00:27:28,993;You don't like it?
376;00:27:27,233;00:27:28,993;I want to take a walk.
377;00:27:29,035;00:27:29,935;You can't.
378;00:27:30,203;00:27:31,637;Cersei has offered a lordship
379;00:27:31,971;00:27:33,805;to the man who brings
379;00:27:31,971;00:27:33,805;her your head.
380;00:27:34,073;00:27:35,673;She ought to offer her cunt.
381;00:27:36,009;00:27:38,410;Best part of her
381;00:27:36,009;00:27:38,410;for the best part of me.
382;00:27:38,844;00:27:42,381;Well, I suppose a box is as good
382;00:27:38,844;00:27:42,381;a place for me as anywhere.
383;00:27:42,748;00:27:45,617;Are we really going to spend
383;00:27:42,748;00:27:45,617;the entire road to Volantis
384;00:27:45,919;00:27:47,652;talking about
384;00:27:45,919;00:27:47,652;the futility of everything?
385;00:27:47,921;00:27:49,554;You're right.
385;00:27:47,921;00:27:49,554;No point.
386;00:27:49,822;00:27:51,789;The road to Volantis?
387;00:27:52,190;00:27:54,691;You said we were going to Meereen.
387;00:27:52,190;00:27:54,691;What's in Volantis?
388;00:27:54,927;00:27:56,327;The road to Meereen.
389;00:27:56,761;00:27:59,763;And what do you hope to find at
389;00:27:56,761;00:27:59,763;the end of the road to Meereen?
390;00:28:00,032;00:28:02,099;I told you.
390;00:28:00,032;00:28:02,099;A ruler.
391;00:28:02,367;00:28:04,168;We've already got a ruler.
392;00:28:04,502;00:28:06,938;Everywhere has already
392;00:28:04,502;00:28:06,938;got a ruler.
393;00:28:07,272;00:28:09,873;Every pile of shit
393;00:28:07,272;00:28:09,873;on the side of every road
394;00:28:10,207;00:28:11,875;has someone's banner
394;00:28:10,207;00:28:11,875;hanging from it.
395;00:28:12,209;00:28:15,913;You were quite good,
395;00:28:12,209;00:28:15,913;you know, at ruling.
396;00:28:16,213;00:28:18,482;During your brief
396;00:28:16,213;00:28:18,482;tenure as Hand.
397;00:28:18,750;00:28:20,484;I didn't rule.
397;00:28:18,750;00:28:20,484;I was a servant.
398;00:28:20,718;00:28:22,719;Still, a man of talent.
399;00:28:23,020;00:28:24,300;Managed to kill a lot of people.
400;00:28:24,688;00:28:28,524;Yes, but you showed great
400;00:28:24,688;00:28:28,524;promise in other areas as well.
401;00:28:32,063;00:28:34,530;She wanted me
401;00:28:32,063;00:28:34,530;to leave King's Landing.
402;00:28:34,731;00:28:36,632;She begged me.
403;00:28:36,867;00:28:38,335;I wouldn't go.
404;00:28:38,469;00:28:39,669;Why?
405;00:28:39,903;00:28:41,938;'Cause I liked it.
406;00:28:42,205;00:28:45,708;Power.
406;00:28:42,205;00:28:45,708;Even as a servant.
407;00:28:45,943;00:28:48,945;People follow leaders.
408;00:28:49,245;00:28:50,813;And they will never follow us.
409;00:28:51,081;00:28:52,715;They find us repulsive.
410;00:28:52,950;00:28:54,249;I find us repulsive.
411;00:28:54,485;00:28:56,285;And we find them repulsive,
412;00:28:56,720;00:28:59,654;which is why we surround ourselves
412;00:28:56,720;00:28:59,654;with large, comfortable boxes
413;00:28:59,889;00:29:01,457;to keep them away.
414;00:29:01,624;00:29:03,758;And yet,
415;00:29:03,994;00:29:06,095;no matter what we do,
416;00:29:06,562;00:29:10,432;people like you and me are never
416;00:29:06,562;00:29:10,432;really satisfied inside the box.
417;00:29:10,633;00:29:12,767;Not for long.
418;00:29:12,969;00:29:14,870;You're right.
419;00:29:15,137;00:29:17,405;Let's go for a walk.
419;00:29:15,137;00:29:17,405;No.
420;00:29:17,740;00:29:20,509;How many dwarves
420;00:29:17,740;00:29:20,509;are there in the world?
421;00:29:20,810;00:29:22,844;Is Cersei going
421;00:29:20,810;00:29:22,844;to kill them all?
422;00:29:27,483;00:29:29,050;Not him.
423;00:29:29,351;00:29:30,985;Are you trying
423;00:29:29,351;00:29:30,985;to deceive your queen?
424;00:29:31,320;00:29:33,687;Shall I throw them
424;00:29:31,320;00:29:33,687;in a cell, Your Grace?
425;00:29:33,989;00:29:35,523;That won't be necessary,
425;00:29:33,989;00:29:35,523;Ser Meryn.
426;00:29:35,857;00:29:38,092;I don't want to dissuade
426;00:29:35,857;00:29:38,092;the other hunters.
427;00:29:38,327;00:29:40,061;Mistakes will be made.
428;00:29:40,462;00:29:41,929;Thank you, Your Grace, thank you.
428;00:29:40,462;00:29:41,929;Your Grace, thank you.
429;00:29:42,264;00:29:43,865;Take the head.
429;00:29:42,264;00:29:43,865;Pardon me, Your Grace.
430;00:29:43,999;00:29:45,699;I would take it
430;00:29:43,999;00:29:45,699;if you don't mind.
431;00:29:46,001;00:29:48,536;It could prove useful
431;00:29:46,001;00:29:48,536;for my work.
432;00:29:48,703;00:29:50,170;Very good.
433;00:29:53,141;00:29:55,308;Over there will be fine.
434;00:29:56,310;00:29:58,812;You heard the man.
434;00:29:56,310;00:29:58,812;Over there.
435;00:30:26,574;00:30:27,974;You're the Hand of the King?
436;00:30:28,175;00:30:29,642;No, Uncle.
437;00:30:29,977;00:30:30,910;Clearly it would not
437;00:30:29,977;00:30:30,910;be appropriate
438;00:30:31,211;00:30:33,379;for a woman to assume that role.
439;00:30:33,747;00:30:35,627;I'm merely advising my son
439;00:30:33,747;00:30:35,627;until he comes of age
440;00:30:35,816;00:30:37,216;and chooses a Hand for himself.
441;00:30:37,650;00:30:40,652;Your Grace, I would be willing
441;00:30:37,650;00:30:40,652;to serve provisionally
442;00:30:41,020;00:30:42,900;as the King's Hand until
442;00:30:41,020;00:30:42,900;he becomes old enough--
443;00:30:43,190;00:30:44,430;You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,
444;00:30:44,724;00:30:46,592;but I don't imagine
444;00:30:44,724;00:30:46,592;you'll have the time.
445;00:30:46,893;00:30:48,760;In addition to being
445;00:30:46,893;00:30:48,760;Master of Ships,
446;00:30:49,096;00:30:51,663;the king has appointed
446;00:30:49,096;00:30:51,663;you Master of Coin.
447;00:30:52,899;00:30:53,999;Oh, Your Grace.
448;00:30:54,333;00:30:55,901;He called your experience
448;00:30:54,333;00:30:55,901;and wisdom
449;00:30:56,202;00:30:58,169;in financial matters
449;00:30:56,202;00:30:58,169;unparalleled.
450;00:30:58,504;00:31:00,572;He said he would
450;00:30:58,504;00:31:00,572;be honored to have you
451;00:31:00,907;00:31:02,627;represent the crown's
451;00:31:00,907;00:31:02,627;interests in the same.
452;00:31:02,709;00:31:04,476;The honor is all mine,
452;00:31:02,709;00:31:04,476;Your Grace.
453;00:31:04,844;00:31:07,613;Your Grace, in the past
453;00:31:04,844;00:31:07,613;on several occasions,
454;00:31:07,947;00:31:10,381;a Grand Maester has served
454;00:31:07,947;00:31:10,381;as the King's Hand.
455;00:31:10,749;00:31:15,052;The king has named Qyburn
455;00:31:10,749;00:31:15,052;the new Master of Whisperers.
456;00:31:16,855;00:31:19,524;Your Grace, him?
456;00:31:16,855;00:31:19,524;This-- this man?
457;00:31:19,858;00:31:23,128;This embarrassment
457;00:31:19,858;00:31:23,128;to the Citadel?
458;00:31:23,429;00:31:26,363;Your Grace, what qualifications
459;00:31:26,698;00:31:28,298;can he possibly have
459;00:31:26,698;00:31:28,298;for this post?
460;00:31:28,634;00:31:31,235;The qualification
460;00:31:28,634;00:31:31,235;of loyalty, Grand Maester.
461;00:31:31,569;00:31:33,170;That's far more
461;00:31:31,569;00:31:33,170;than the eunuch ever had.
462;00:31:33,271;00:31:35,840;Far more than many ever have.
463;00:31:36,108;00:31:38,676;I must say,
463;00:31:36,108;00:31:38,676;I cannot see--
464;00:31:38,977;00:31:41,078;Uncle Kevan, in light
464;00:31:38,977;00:31:41,078;of your position
465;00:31:41,412;00:31:42,912;as commander
465;00:31:41,412;00:31:42,912;of the Lannister armies,
466;00:31:43,381;00:31:46,450;it would please the king if you
466;00:31:43,381;00:31:46,450;would serve as his Master of War.
467;00:31:46,784;00:31:49,653;No man living better
467;00:31:46,784;00:31:49,653;deserves the title.
468;00:31:49,920;00:31:51,921;That is kind of you to say.
469;00:31:52,257;00:31:54,058;I would like to hear it
469;00:31:52,257;00:31:54,058;from the king himself.
470;00:31:54,392;00:31:55,832;The king is very busy
470;00:31:54,392;00:31:55,832;at this moment.
471;00:31:56,161;00:31:58,328;He should be here learning
471;00:31:56,161;00:31:58,328;what it means to rule.
472;00:31:58,563;00:31:59,896;He is learning.
473;00:32:00,264;00:32:02,165;On this occasion,
473;00:32:00,264;00:32:02,165;in his capacity as ruler,
474;00:32:02,466;00:32:04,668;he's asked me to speak
474;00:32:02,466;00:32:04,668;on his behalf.
475;00:32:05,102;00:32:08,004;I returned to the capital to
475;00:32:05,102;00:32:08,004;pay my respects to my brother.
476;00:32:08,305;00:32:11,474;And to you.
476;00:32:08,305;00:32:11,474;And to serve the king.
477;00:32:11,776;00:32:13,509;I did not return to the capital
478;00:32:13,778;00:32:15,178;to serve as your puppet.
479;00:32:15,579;00:32:18,947;To watch you stack the small
479;00:32:15,579;00:32:18,947;council with sycophants.
480;00:32:19,316;00:32:21,517;Sending your own brother
480;00:32:19,316;00:32:21,517;away so he wouldn't be--
481;00:32:21,851;00:32:23,371;My brother has left
481;00:32:21,851;00:32:23,371;the capital to lead
482;00:32:23,520;00:32:25,087;a sensitive diplomatic mission.
483;00:32:25,289;00:32:26,121;What mission?
484;00:32:26,490;00:32:29,292;That is not your concern
484;00:32:26,490;00:32:29,292;as Master of War.
485;00:32:30,994;00:32:32,594;I do not recognize
485;00:32:30,994;00:32:32,594;your authority
486;00:32:32,929;00:32:35,831;to dictate what is
486;00:32:32,929;00:32:35,831;and is not my concern.
487;00:32:36,166;00:32:39,367;You are the Queen Mother,
487;00:32:36,166;00:32:39,367;nothing more.
488;00:32:43,439;00:32:45,841;You would abandon your king
488;00:32:43,439;00:32:45,841;in his time of need?
489;00:32:46,209;00:32:49,177;If he wants to send for me,
489;00:32:46,209;00:32:49,177;I will be waiting for him.
490;00:32:49,378;00:32:51,479;At Casterly Rock.
491;00:32:58,887;00:33:01,155;Come on,
491;00:32:58,887;00:33:01,155;you know this one.
492;00:33:03,058;00:33:04,559;It looks like an animal.
493;00:33:07,029;00:33:08,796;Snake.
494;00:33:08,997;00:33:11,432;Sssnake. S.
495;00:33:11,734;00:33:13,968;It's an S.
495;00:33:11,734;00:33:13,968;Right, very good.
496;00:33:14,136;00:33:16,104;Huh!
497;00:33:16,504;00:33:18,705;Did you know that the youngest
497;00:33:16,504;00:33:18,705;Lord Commander in history
498;00:33:18,907;00:33:21,008;Osric Stark was elected
498;00:33:18,907;00:33:21,008;at the age of 10?
499;00:33:23,044;00:33:24,878;I know S.
500;00:33:25,146;00:33:26,614;You'll learn, I promise.
501;00:33:27,148;00:33:29,948;I taught Ser Davos, and old people
501;00:33:27,148;00:33:29,948;are terrible at learning new things.
502;00:33:29,984;00:33:32,919;Well, you're
502;00:33:29,984;00:33:32,919;a wonderful teacher.
503;00:33:33,154;00:33:34,555;Very patient.
504;00:33:34,989;00:33:37,491;I only said that the more time
504;00:33:34,989;00:33:37,491;that you spend practicing,
505;00:33:37,825;00:33:39,146;the faster
505;00:33:37,825;00:33:39,146;you'll be able to read.
506;00:33:39,227;00:33:41,628;That's all right.
506;00:33:39,227;00:33:41,628;We're doing just fine.
507;00:33:41,896;00:33:44,097;I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark
508;00:33:44,365;00:33:46,767;have a lot to talk about.
509;00:33:49,103;00:33:51,437;How old were you when you
509;00:33:49,103;00:33:51,437;learned how to read?
510;00:33:51,672;00:33:53,140;Three.
510;00:33:51,672;00:33:53,140;Three?
511;00:33:53,407;00:33:54,528;Who taught you, your mother?
512;00:33:54,775;00:33:58,177;No, old Maester Cressen did.
513;00:33:58,445;00:33:59,912;I had a lot of time to practice.
514;00:34:00,213;00:34:02,181;My mother kept me
514;00:34:00,213;00:34:02,181;inside because...
515;00:34:04,418;00:34:06,386;What do you call it
515;00:34:04,418;00:34:06,386;in the south,
516;00:34:06,687;00:34:08,388;what happened to your face?
517;00:34:08,589;00:34:10,156;Greyscale.
518;00:34:10,457;00:34:13,025;What do you call it
518;00:34:10,457;00:34:13,025;north of the Wall?
519;00:34:13,226;00:34:15,327;I don't know.
520;00:34:15,595;00:34:16,929;But two of my sisters had it.
521;00:34:17,130;00:34:18,764;They both died.
522;00:34:19,032;00:34:20,166;How did they cure you?
523;00:34:20,400;00:34:21,967;I don't remember.
524;00:34:22,202;00:34:23,468;I was a baby.
525;00:34:23,804;00:34:25,404;Lots of people came
525;00:34:23,804;00:34:25,404;and tried, I think.
526;00:34:25,705;00:34:27,806;Whatever they did, it went away.
527;00:34:29,875;00:34:31,410;What happened to your sisters?
528;00:34:33,879;00:34:38,283;My father made them move out of
528;00:34:33,879;00:34:38,283;the keep into the huts outside.
529;00:34:38,618;00:34:40,452;None of us were allowed
529;00:34:38,618;00:34:40,452;to go near them.
530;00:34:40,787;00:34:44,856;But we heard them,
530;00:34:40,787;00:34:44,856;especially at night.
531;00:34:45,224;00:34:49,127;They started to sound
531;00:34:45,224;00:34:49,127;not like themselves.
532;00:34:49,394;00:34:51,462;Did you ever see them?
533;00:34:52,731;00:34:54,732;Only once at the end.
534;00:34:56,568;00:34:58,502;They were covered with it.
535;00:34:58,770;00:35:01,605;Their faces, their arms.
536;00:35:02,974;00:35:04,141;They acted like animals.
537;00:35:05,844;00:35:08,912;My father had to drag them
537;00:35:05,844;00:35:08,912;out to the woods on a rope.
538;00:35:09,247;00:35:11,449;What did he do with them
538;00:35:09,247;00:35:11,449;in the woods?
539;00:35:17,021;00:35:18,455;Mother.
540;00:35:18,656;00:35:20,123;Leave us.
541;00:35:22,994;00:35:24,094;Your Grace.
542;00:35:26,097;00:35:27,537;You need to stay
542;00:35:26,097;00:35:27,537;away from that girl.
543;00:35:27,698;00:35:28,932;Why?
543;00:35:27,698;00:35:28,932;She's a wildling.
544;00:35:29,200;00:35:31,168;Her name is Gilly.
544;00:35:29,200;00:35:31,168;She's nice.
545;00:35:31,435;00:35:32,435;I'm teaching her to read.
546;00:35:32,503;00:35:33,770;She's a wildling.
547;00:35:34,037;00:35:35,472;Your father defeated her people.
548;00:35:35,773;00:35:38,441;He executed their king
548;00:35:35,773;00:35:38,441;for treason.
549;00:35:38,809;00:35:41,177;They could strike at him
549;00:35:38,809;00:35:41,177;by striking at you.
550;00:35:41,445;00:35:43,513;Gilly wouldn't do that.
551;00:35:45,115;00:35:47,650;You have no idea
551;00:35:45,115;00:35:47,650;what people will do.
552;00:35:47,985;00:35:50,052;All your books
552;00:35:47,985;00:35:50,052;and you still don't know.
553;00:35:56,493;00:35:58,533;I ordered Mance
553;00:35:56,493;00:35:58,533;Rayder burned at the stake.
554;00:35:58,828;00:36:01,197;You prevented that order
554;00:35:58,828;00:36:01,197;from being carried out.
555;00:36:01,498;00:36:03,766;You showed mercy
555;00:36:01,498;00:36:03,766;to Mance Rayder.
556;00:36:04,001;00:36:06,269;A king's word is law.
557;00:36:06,636;00:36:08,477;Perhaps you should ask
557;00:36:06,636;00:36:08,477;Ser Davos how much mercy
558;00:36:08,571;00:36:10,639;I show to lawbreakers.
559;00:36:14,411;00:36:16,212;Show too much kindness,
559;00:36:14,411;00:36:16,212;people won't fear you.
560;00:36:16,546;00:36:18,347;If they don't fear you,
560;00:36:16,546;00:36:18,347;they don't follow you.
561;00:36:18,415;00:36:20,115;With respect, Your Grace,
562;00:36:20,550;00:36:23,651;the free folk will never follow
562;00:36:20,550;00:36:23,651;you no matter what you do.
563;00:36:23,986;00:36:25,666;You're the man who burned
563;00:36:23,986;00:36:25,666;their king alive.
564;00:36:25,754;00:36:27,755;Who, then?
565;00:36:29,491;00:36:30,558;You?
566;00:36:30,726;00:36:32,527;No.
567;00:36:32,761;00:36:34,662;Only one of their own.
568;00:36:36,832;00:36:39,000;Do you know this wretched girl,
569;00:36:39,201;00:36:40,568;Lyanna Mormont?
570;00:36:40,836;00:36:42,570;The Lord Commander's niece.
571;00:36:42,905;00:36:45,940;Lady of Bear Island
571;00:36:42,905;00:36:45,940;and a child of 10.
572;00:36:48,176;00:36:50,736;I asked her to commit her house
572;00:36:48,176;00:36:50,736;to my cause. That's her response.
573;00:36:51,079;00:36:53,714;Bear Island knows no king
573;00:36:51,079;00:36:53,714;but the King in the North,
574;00:36:53,949;00:36:55,983;whose name is Stark.
575;00:36:56,217;00:36:58,018;That amuses you?
576;00:36:59,554;00:37:02,489;I apologize, Your Grace.
577;00:37:02,857;00:37:06,760;Northerners can be
577;00:37:02,857;00:37:06,760;a bit like the free folk.
578;00:37:07,095;00:37:10,064;Loyal to their own.
578;00:37:07,095;00:37:10,064;- I know.
579;00:37:10,398;00:37:12,333;My brother Robert
579;00:37:10,398;00:37:12,333;went on often and loudly
580;00:37:12,700;00:37:14,634;about how difficult
580;00:37:12,700;00:37:14,634;it was to control them.
581;00:37:16,904;00:37:18,638;Even with your father's help.
582;00:37:21,876;00:37:25,378;Tonight, the Night's Watch
582;00:37:21,876;00:37:25,378;elect a new Lord Commander.
583;00:37:25,646;00:37:27,313;Ser Alliser Thorne
583;00:37:25,646;00:37:27,313;is going to win.
584;00:37:27,615;00:37:29,849;Most likely.
584;00:37:27,615;00:37:29,849;Unpleasant man.
585;00:37:30,117;00:37:32,418;He thinks you're a traitor.
586;00:37:32,919;00:37:35,355;What's your life going to be like here
586;00:37:32,919;00:37:35,355;at the Wall with Thorne in command?
587;00:37:35,589;00:37:37,156;Unpleasant, I expect.
588;00:37:37,458;00:37:40,126;Your bravery made him look weak.
589;00:37:40,394;00:37:42,228;He'll punish you for it.
590;00:37:42,496;00:37:43,929;I don't punish men for bravery.
591;00:37:44,131;00:37:45,898;I reward them.
592;00:37:46,165;00:37:48,667;I don't doubt it, Your Grace.
593;00:37:49,002;00:37:50,736;But I'm a brother
593;00:37:49,002;00:37:50,736;of the Night's Watch.
594;00:37:51,104;00:37:53,204;I pledged them my life,
594;00:37:51,104;00:37:53,204;my honor, my sword.
595;00:37:53,506;00:37:55,840;I don't know what
595;00:37:53,506;00:37:55,840;I have left to give you.
596;00:37:56,108;00:37:57,909;You can give me the North.
597;00:37:58,110;00:38:00,077;I can't.
598;00:38:01,814;00:38:04,081;Even if I wanted to,
598;00:38:01,814;00:38:04,081;I'm a bastard,
599;00:38:04,282;00:38:05,249;a Snow.
600;00:38:05,651;00:38:08,452;Kneel before me. Lay
600;00:38:05,651;00:38:08,452;your sword at my feet.
601;00:38:08,853;00:38:11,722;Pledge me your service and
601;00:38:08,853;00:38:11,722;you'll rise again as Jon Stark,
602;00:38:11,956;00:38:13,757;Lord of Winterfell.
603;00:38:19,131;00:38:21,365;He'll make you a Stark
603;00:38:19,131;00:38:21,365;with the stroke of a pen?
604;00:38:21,699;00:38:25,002;It's the first thing
604;00:38:21,699;00:38:25,002;I ever remember wanting.
605;00:38:25,336;00:38:28,171;I'd daydream that my father
605;00:38:25,336;00:38:28,171;would ask the king
606;00:38:28,640;00:38:31,321;and just like that, I would never
606;00:38:28,640;00:38:31,321;be the bastard of Winterfell again.
607;00:38:31,342;00:38:33,476;You deserve this.
607;00:38:31,342;00:38:33,476;You do.
608;00:38:33,778;00:38:36,179;I couldn't be happier for you.
609;00:38:36,447;00:38:38,682;I'm going to refuse him.
610;00:38:40,484;00:38:44,054;But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.
611;00:38:44,355;00:38:46,489;I swore a vow
611;00:38:44,355;00:38:46,489;to the Night's Watch.
612;00:38:46,823;00:38:48,303;If I don't take
612;00:38:46,823;00:38:48,303;my own word seriously,
613;00:38:48,659;00:38:50,893;what sort of Lord
613;00:38:48,659;00:38:50,893;of Winterfell would I be?
614;00:38:55,899;00:38:58,801;Crowded. You'd think
614;00:38:55,899;00:38:58,801;we were serving venison stew.
615;00:39:06,076;00:39:10,412;Does anyone wish
615;00:39:06,076;00:39:10,412;to speak for candidates
616;00:39:10,681;00:39:13,415;before we cast our tokens
617;00:39:13,684;00:39:17,786;for the 998th Lord Commander
618;00:39:18,020;00:39:19,488;of the Night's Watch?
619;00:39:21,991;00:39:23,858;Ser Alliser Thorne
619;00:39:21,991;00:39:23,858;is not just a knight,
620;00:39:24,160;00:39:25,561;he's a man of true nobility.
621;00:39:25,995;00:39:28,597;He was acting commander when
621;00:39:25,995;00:39:28,597;the Wall came under attack
622;00:39:29,031;00:39:31,591;and led us to victory against the wildlings.
622;00:39:29,031;00:39:31,591;Hear, hear.
623;00:39:31,701;00:39:33,101;He's a veteran
623;00:39:31,701;00:39:33,101;of 100 battles
624;00:39:33,569;00:39:36,170;and has been a defender of the Watch
624;00:39:33,569;00:39:36,170;and the Wall almost all of his life.
625;00:39:36,371;00:39:37,739;Aye.
626;00:39:38,007;00:39:39,507;He's the only true choice.
627;00:39:44,546;00:39:46,982;Ser Denys Mallister
627;00:39:44,546;00:39:46,982;joined the Watch as a boy
628;00:39:47,382;00:39:49,883;and has served loyally
628;00:39:47,382;00:39:49,883;longer than any other ranger.
629;00:39:50,185;00:39:52,653;Through 10 winters he served.
630;00:39:52,954;00:39:54,489;As commander
630;00:39:52,954;00:39:54,489;of the Shadow Tower,
631;00:39:54,756;00:39:56,290;he kept the wildlings away.
632;00:39:56,558;00:39:57,925;We could do no better.
633;00:40:02,631;00:40:04,364;If there is no one else,
634;00:40:04,633;00:40:06,066;we will begin the voting.
635;00:40:06,367;00:40:08,969;The triangular tokens count
636;00:40:09,237;00:40:11,639;for Ser Alliser Thorne.
637;00:40:11,973;00:40:15,609;The square tokens
637;00:40:11,973;00:40:15,609;for Ser Denys Mallister.
638;00:40:15,944;00:40:18,746;Each brother will--
638;00:40:15,944;00:40:18,746;- Maester Aemon.
639;00:40:19,981;00:40:22,882;Samwell Tarly. Go on.
640;00:40:24,385;00:40:26,753;Sam the Slayer.
641;00:40:27,155;00:40:29,589;Another wildling lover just
641;00:40:27,155;00:40:29,589;like his friend Jon Snow.
642;00:40:29,890;00:40:31,724;How's your lady love, Slayer?
643;00:40:32,059;00:40:34,461;Her name is Gilly.
644;00:40:34,795;00:40:36,363;Brother Slynt
644;00:40:34,795;00:40:36,363;knows her quite well.
645;00:40:36,797;00:40:39,598;They cowered together in the larder
645;00:40:36,797;00:40:39,598;during the battle for the Wall.
646;00:40:39,900;00:40:41,433;Lies!
647;00:40:41,669;00:40:44,336;A wildling girl, a baby,
648;00:40:44,571;00:40:46,039;and Lord Janos.
649;00:40:46,406;00:40:48,808;I found him there
649;00:40:46,406;00:40:48,808;after the battle was over
650;00:40:49,109;00:40:50,309;in a puddle of his own making.
651;00:40:54,847;00:40:57,249;Whilst Lord Janos was hiding
652;00:40:57,517;00:40:59,718;with the women and children,
653;00:40:59,952;00:41:02,087;Jon Snow was leading.
654;00:41:02,422;00:41:04,657;Ser Alliser fought
654;00:41:02,422;00:41:04,657;bravely, it is true.
655;00:41:04,991;00:41:07,426;And when he was wounded,
655;00:41:04,991;00:41:07,426;it was Jon who saved us.
656;00:41:07,760;00:41:09,528;He took charge
656;00:41:07,760;00:41:09,528;of the Wall's defense.
657;00:41:09,829;00:41:11,663;He killed the Magnar
657;00:41:09,829;00:41:11,663;of the Thenns.
658;00:41:11,998;00:41:14,299;He went north to deal
658;00:41:11,998;00:41:14,299;with Mance Rayder
659;00:41:14,667;00:41:17,335;knowing it almost certainly
659;00:41:14,667;00:41:17,335;meant his own death.
660;00:41:20,807;00:41:23,408;Before that,
661;00:41:23,776;00:41:26,611;he led the mission to avenge
661;00:41:23,776;00:41:26,611;Lord Commander Mormont.
662;00:41:28,380;00:41:31,015;Mormont himself chose Jon
662;00:41:28,380;00:41:31,015;to be his steward.
663;00:41:31,450;00:41:34,885;He saw something in Jon and
663;00:41:31,450;00:41:34,885;now we've all seen it, too.
664;00:41:35,120;00:41:37,755;He may be young,
665;00:41:38,056;00:41:39,990;but he's the commander
665;00:41:38,056;00:41:39,990;we turned to
666;00:41:40,226;00:41:41,559;when the night was darkest.
667;00:41:49,901;00:41:52,903;I can't argue with any of that.
668;00:41:54,139;00:41:56,340;But who does Jon Snow
668;00:41:54,139;00:41:56,340;want to command?
669;00:41:56,541;00:41:59,776;Night's Watch
670;00:42:00,010;00:42:01,578;or the wildlings?
671;00:42:01,912;00:42:05,415;Everyone knows he loved
671;00:42:01,912;00:42:05,415;a wildling girl
672;00:42:05,750;00:42:07,417;and spoke with
672;00:42:05,750;00:42:07,417;Mance Rayder many times.
673;00:42:07,885;00:42:11,187;What would have happened in that
673;00:42:07,885;00:42:11,187;tent between those two old friends
674;00:42:11,522;00:42:13,523;if Stannis's army
674;00:42:11,522;00:42:13,523;hadn't come along?
675;00:42:13,924;00:42:18,228;We all saw him put the
675;00:42:13,924;00:42:18,228;King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery.
676;00:42:18,729;00:42:22,198;Do you want to choose a man who has
676;00:42:18,729;00:42:22,198;fought the wildlings all his life
677;00:42:22,499;00:42:24,600;or a man who makes love to them?
678;00:42:32,409;00:42:33,909;It is time.
679;00:43:19,988;00:43:22,924;It appears to be a tie, Maester.
680;00:43:43,611;00:43:46,747;Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow!
