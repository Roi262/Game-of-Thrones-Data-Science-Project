4;00:03:29,662;00:03:32,364;I've been sweeping
4;00:03:29,662;00:03:32,364;this floor for days.
5;00:03:32,366;00:03:33,799;Good.
6;00:03:33,833;00:03:35,951;I didn't come here
6;00:03:33,833;00:03:35,951;to sweep floors.
7;00:03:36,002;00:03:38,370;No?
8;00:03:38,372;00:03:40,205;Why come, then?
9;00:03:40,256;00:03:43,375;You said I could be
9;00:03:40,256;00:03:43,375;your apprentice.
10;00:03:43,377;00:03:45,961;You said you'd teach me
10;00:03:43,377;00:03:45,961;how to be a Faceless Man.
11;00:03:46,012;00:03:48,180;A man teaches a girl.
12;00:03:49,882;00:03:51,817;Valar dohaeris.
13;00:03:51,851;00:03:54,019;All men must serve.
14;00:03:54,053;00:03:56,188;Faceless Men most of all.
15;00:03:57,807;00:04:00,392;I want to serve.
16;00:04:02,895;00:04:05,197;A girl wants to serve herself.
17;00:04:05,231;00:04:07,699;Here we serve
17;00:04:05,231;00:04:07,699;the Many-Faced God.
18;00:04:07,734;00:04:09,234;To serve well,
19;00:04:09,236;00:04:11,570;a girl must become no one.
20;00:04:11,572;00:04:13,372;Which one's
20;00:04:11,572;00:04:13,372;the Many-Faced God?
21;00:04:13,406;00:04:17,325;I see the Stranger.
21;00:04:13,406;00:04:17,325;I see the Drowned God.
22;00:04:17,377;00:04:18,910;I see the weirwood face.
23;00:04:18,912;00:04:21,279;There is only one god.
24;00:04:21,314;00:04:23,749;A girl knows his name.
25;00:04:23,800;00:04:25,851;And all men know his gift.
26;00:05:03,339;00:05:05,540;Where are they taking him?
27;00:05:22,859;00:05:27,529;Queen Margaery!
27;00:05:22,859;00:05:27,529;Queen Margaery!
28;00:05:32,485;00:05:34,703;Queen Margaery!
29;00:05:36,989;00:05:38,990;Queen Margaery!
30;00:05:38,992;00:05:41,326;Queen Margaery!
31;00:05:45,748;00:05:48,917;I am his and he is mine.
31;00:05:45,748;00:05:48,917;I am hers and she is mine.
32;00:05:48,968;00:05:52,671;From this day until
32;00:05:48,968;00:05:52,671;the end of my days.
33;00:06:36,215;00:06:38,133;Did I hurt you?
34;00:06:38,184;00:06:40,385;No.
34;00:06:38,184;00:06:40,385;You were lovely.
35;00:06:40,436;00:06:43,555;It all happened so fast.
35;00:06:40,436;00:06:43,555;Yes.
36;00:06:43,557;00:06:45,524;I was scared maybe I hurt you.
37;00:06:45,558;00:06:48,193;It sounded like--
37;00:06:45,558;00:06:48,193;No, no, no.
38;00:06:48,227;00:06:49,895;You're very sweet.
39;00:06:49,897;00:06:53,231;The sweetest king
39;00:06:49,897;00:06:53,231;who ever lived.
40;00:06:53,282;00:06:56,618;This is all I want
40;00:06:53,282;00:06:56,618;to do all day,
41;00:06:56,652;00:06:58,320;every day,
41;00:06:56,652;00:06:58,320;for the rest of my life.
42;00:06:58,371;00:07:01,156;Wouldn't
42;00:06:58,371;00:07:01,156;that be glorious?
43;00:07:02,575;00:07:04,209;Shouldn't we rest
43;00:07:02,575;00:07:04,209;a little while?
44;00:07:04,243;00:07:06,795;Just to catch our breath?
44;00:07:04,243;00:07:06,795;There's no rush, is there?
45;00:07:06,829;00:07:09,247;Of course not.
46;00:07:09,298;00:07:10,882;Are you hungry?
47;00:07:10,917;00:07:13,301;Should I have them bring you
47;00:07:10,917;00:07:13,301;some cake or pomegranate juice?
48;00:07:13,336;00:07:15,086;No, I'm fine.
49;00:07:15,171;00:07:18,306;I just want you all to myself.
50;00:07:18,341;00:07:20,725;I want to know everything
50;00:07:18,341;00:07:20,725;there is to know
51;00:07:20,760;00:07:23,929;about King Tommen,
51;00:07:20,760;00:07:23,929;First of His Name.
52;00:07:23,931;00:07:25,931;King Tommen.
53;00:07:25,982;00:07:28,984;Still sounds strange to me.
54;00:07:29,018;00:07:31,736;Does Queen Margaery
54;00:07:29,018;00:07:31,736;sound strange to you?
55;00:07:32,605;00:07:34,606;So strange.
56;00:07:34,690;00:07:36,608;Husband.
56;00:07:34,690;00:07:36,608;Wife.
57;00:07:39,829;00:07:42,163;Sometimes it feels odd.
58;00:07:42,198;00:07:43,848;I'm the king,
59;00:07:43,883;00:07:47,953;I've married the most
59;00:07:43,883;00:07:47,953;beautiful woman in the world,
60;00:07:47,987;00:07:51,122;and it's all because
60;00:07:47,987;00:07:51,122;my brother died.
61;00:07:51,173;00:07:53,341;I understand.
62;00:07:53,376;00:07:56,711;But it's not your fault.
62;00:07:53,376;00:07:56,711;You know that, don't you?
63;00:07:56,762;00:07:58,680;You mustn't feel guilty.
64;00:07:59,849;00:08:02,234;I don't feel guilty.
65;00:08:02,268;00:08:04,102;That's what's odd.
66;00:08:07,056;00:08:08,473;Do you like to sail?
67;00:08:08,524;00:08:10,558;I love to sail.
68;00:08:10,610;00:08:12,694;I do, too.
69;00:08:12,728;00:08:15,897;I think we're going to be
69;00:08:12,728;00:08:15,897;very happy, you and I.
70;00:08:15,948;00:08:18,400;I do, too.
71;00:08:21,070;00:08:25,540;Living in a tower so
71;00:08:21,070;00:08:25,540;high itches the clouds.
72;00:08:26,993;00:08:29,494;Of course, my grandmother
72;00:08:26,993;00:08:29,494;couldn't wait to go home.
73;00:08:29,545;00:08:32,330;The capital's not
73;00:08:29,545;00:08:32,330;for everyone, I suppose.
74;00:08:34,300;00:08:37,302;Does your mother like it here?
75;00:08:37,336;00:08:39,254;I don't think so.
76;00:08:39,305;00:08:42,007;She told me never to trust
76;00:08:39,305;00:08:42,007;anyone in King's Landing.
77;00:08:43,676;00:08:46,728;It's so wonderful to have
77;00:08:43,676;00:08:46,728;her watching over you.
78;00:08:46,762;00:08:49,514;A lioness guarding her cub.
79;00:08:49,565;00:08:52,183;Well, but I'm a man now.
80;00:08:55,021;00:08:56,855;You are.
81;00:08:58,324;00:08:59,824;And the king.
82;00:09:01,994;00:09:04,829;But you'll always be
82;00:09:01,994;00:09:04,829;her baby boy.
83;00:09:04,864;00:09:08,033;I suppose.
83;00:09:04,864;00:09:08,033;I adore her.
84;00:09:08,084;00:09:12,454;She's always been so
84;00:09:08,084;00:09:12,454;generous with me, so kind.
85;00:09:12,505;00:09:14,289;And the horrors
85;00:09:12,505;00:09:14,289;she's had to endure--
86;00:09:14,340;00:09:18,043;losing her husband, her
86;00:09:14,340;00:09:18,043;eldest child, and her father.
87;00:09:18,094;00:09:20,795;It's no wonder she's
87;00:09:18,094;00:09:20,795;so protective of you.
88;00:09:20,846;00:09:23,715;She'll never let you
88;00:09:20,846;00:09:23,715;out of her sight.
89;00:09:26,852;00:09:29,104;You look
89;00:09:26,852;00:09:29,104;very much in love.
90;00:09:29,138;00:09:31,606;The first days of marriage
90;00:09:29,138;00:09:31,606;are often so blissful.
91;00:09:31,640;00:09:35,193;She's certainly
91;00:09:31,640;00:09:35,193;very pretty, isn't she?
92;00:09:35,227;00:09:36,895;Like a doll.
93;00:09:36,897;00:09:39,030;She smiles quite a lot.
94;00:09:40,232;00:09:42,901;Do you think she's intelligent?
95;00:09:42,952;00:09:45,487;I can't quite tell.
96;00:09:45,538;00:09:47,155;Not that it mas.
97;00:09:47,206;00:09:48,790;Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?
98;00:09:48,824;00:09:51,543;There's nothing for me
98;00:09:48,824;00:09:51,543;in Casterly Rock.
99;00:09:51,577;00:09:53,411;That's where you grew up.
100;00:09:54,964;00:09:57,916;You always told me that you
100;00:09:54,964;00:09:57,916;liked the people there better.
101;00:09:57,918;00:10:01,252;You said that King's Landing smelled
101;00:09:57,918;00:10:01,252;of horse dung and sour milk.
102;00:10:04,140;00:10:06,424;Why are we speaking
102;00:10:04,140;00:10:06,424;of Casterly Rock?
103;00:10:06,475;00:10:09,477;The way that
103;00:10:06,475;00:10:09,477;you talked about it,
104;00:10:09,512;00:10:11,479;I always thought
104;00:10:09,512;00:10:11,479;that you missed it,
105;00:10:11,514;00:10:14,766;that you-- that it
105;00:10:11,514;00:10:14,766;was your real home.
106;00:10:14,817;00:10:18,069;This is my real home now,
106;00:10:14,817;00:10:18,069;where my family lives.
107;00:10:19,105;00:10:21,356;I want you to be happy, Mother.
108;00:10:22,274;00:10:24,859;I know that.
109;00:10:24,910;00:10:26,244;I know you do.
110;00:10:26,278;00:10:27,912;My sweet boy.
111;00:10:27,947;00:10:30,281;But wouldn't you be
111;00:10:27,947;00:10:30,281;happier in Casterly Rock?
112;00:10:32,701;00:10:36,004;I said, Darling,
112;00:10:32,701;00:10:36,004;surely four times is enough.
113;00:10:36,038;00:10:38,456;Are you trying to set a new record?
114;00:10:38,458;00:10:41,876;He said, Well, what is the record?
114;00:10:38,458;00:10:41,876;I'm sure we can break it.
115;00:10:46,849;00:10:48,967;Mother.
116;00:10:48,969;00:10:51,386;Welcome.
117;00:10:51,437;00:10:53,304;Don't you look lovely?
118;00:10:53,355;00:10:54,856;Marriage agrees with you.
119;00:10:54,890;00:10:57,275;Can we bring you
119;00:10:54,890;00:10:57,275;anything to eat or drink?
120;00:10:57,309;00:10:59,060;I wish we had some wine for you.
121;00:10:59,111;00:11:01,112;It's a bit early
121;00:10:59,111;00:11:01,112;in the day for us.
122;00:11:02,615;00:11:05,950;No, no, I can't stay.
123;00:11:05,985;00:11:08,703;I just wanted to let you know
124;00:11:08,737;00:11:10,989;if there's ever anything
124;00:11:08,737;00:11:10,989;I can do for you...
125;00:11:10,991;00:11:12,657;You are very sweet.
126;00:11:12,708;00:11:15,160;Tommen seems quite taken
126;00:11:12,708;00:11:15,160;with his new queen.
127;00:11:15,162;00:11:18,079;I absolutely adore him.
128;00:11:18,130;00:11:19,998;You raised a gallant young man.
129;00:11:20,049;00:11:21,549;I'm forever grateful.
130;00:11:21,584;00:11:23,751;Good.
131;00:11:23,803;00:11:26,554;Good. I'm glad to
131;00:11:23,803;00:11:26,554;hear you're happy.
132;00:11:26,589;00:11:28,840;Ecstatic.
132;00:11:26,589;00:11:28,840;I really am.
133;00:11:28,891;00:11:31,009;Exhausted, to be honest.
134;00:11:31,011;00:11:34,813;But what could I expect?
134;00:11:31,011;00:11:34,813;He is half lion, half stag.
135;00:11:36,982;00:11:38,850;I'll leave you to it, then.
136;00:11:38,901;00:11:40,318;Oh, forgive me.
137;00:11:40,352;00:11:42,020;I haven't been
137;00:11:40,352;00:11:42,020;at court for long.
138;00:11:42,071;00:11:43,521;I get so confused.
139;00:11:43,606;00:11:45,740;What's the proper way
139;00:11:43,606;00:11:45,740;to address you now?
140;00:11:45,774;00:11:48,359;Queen Moth or Dowager Queen?
141;00:11:49,862;00:11:51,830;There's no need
141;00:11:49,862;00:11:51,830;for such formalities.
142;00:11:51,864;00:11:55,116;In any event, judging from
142;00:11:51,864;00:11:55,116;the king's enthusiasm,
143;00:11:55,167;00:11:57,702;the Queen Mother will be
143;00:11:55,167;00:11:57,702;a Queen Grandmother soon.
144;00:11:57,704;00:11:59,170;Won't that be a lovely day?
145;00:11:59,205;00:12:00,955;Can you imagine
145;00:11:59,205;00:12:00,955;the celebrations?
146;00:12:01,006;00:12:03,174;They'll ring the bells
146;00:12:01,006;00:12:03,174;all day and night.
147;00:12:03,209;00:12:05,710;Remember...
148;00:12:05,712;00:12:07,879;anything you need.
149;00:13:23,455;00:13:25,673;We can't hold the
149;00:13:23,455;00:13:25,673;North with terror alone.
150;00:13:25,708;00:13:28,343;You can't hold the North if
150;00:13:25,708;00:13:28,343;you let these lesser lords insult us.
151;00:13:28,377;00:13:30,929;I sent you there to
151;00:13:28,377;00:13:30,929;collect taxes, not bodies.
152;00:13:30,963;00:13:33,298;Lord Cerwyn refused to pay.
153;00:13:33,349;00:13:36,267;Said the Warden of the North
153;00:13:33,349;00:13:36,267;would always be a Stark
154;00:13:36,302;00:13:39,053;and he'd be damned if he'd
154;00:13:36,302;00:13:39,053;kiss a traitor's boot.
155;00:13:41,640;00:13:43,441;He left you no choice.
156;00:13:43,475;00:13:47,528;I flayed him living along
156;00:13:43,475;00:13:47,528;with his wife and brother.
157;00:13:47,563;00:13:49,864;Made his son watch.
158;00:13:49,898;00:13:52,150;And?
159;00:13:52,152;00:13:54,652;The new Lord Cerwyn
159;00:13:52,152;00:13:54,652;paid his taxes.
160;00:14:01,160;00:14:03,494;I've something important
160;00:14:01,160;00:14:03,494;to tell you.
161;00:14:04,496;00:14:07,248;Stop eating and listen.
162;00:14:16,342;00:14:17,925;We don't have enough men
162;00:14:16,342;00:14:17,925;to hold the North
163;00:14:17,977;00:14:20,461;if the other houses
163;00:14:17,977;00:14:20,461;rise up against us.
164;00:14:20,496;00:14:21,896;Do you understand that?
165;00:14:21,930;00:14:23,848;Our pact with
165;00:14:21,930;00:14:23,848;the Lannisters protects--
166;00:14:23,932;00:14:25,850;I had a pact
166;00:14:23,932;00:14:25,850;with Tywin Lannister.
167;00:14:25,852;00:14:28,269;And Tywin Lannister is dead.
168;00:14:28,320;00:14:31,656;The remaining Lannisters are a thousand
168;00:14:28,320;00:14:31,656;miles away dealing with that fact.
169;00:14:31,690;00:14:34,158;They've never once in the
169;00:14:31,690;00:14:34,158;history of the Seven Kingdoms
170;00:14:34,193;00:14:36,027;sent their army this far north.
171;00:14:36,078;00:14:38,496;If you think they will
171;00:14:36,078;00:14:38,496;for us, you're a fool.
172;00:14:39,698;00:14:41,366;We've become a great house
173;00:14:41,368;00:14:43,584;by entering into alliances
173;00:14:41,368;00:14:43,584;with other houses
174;00:14:43,619;00:14:47,005;and parlaying those alliances
174;00:14:43,619;00:14:47,005;into greater power.
175;00:14:47,039;00:14:49,657;The best way to forge
175;00:14:47,039;00:14:49,657;a lasting alliance
176;00:14:49,692;00:14:52,260;isn't by peeling
176;00:14:49,692;00:14:52,260;a man's skin off.
177;00:14:52,294;00:14:55,046;The best way is marriage.
178;00:14:55,097;00:14:58,049;Now that you're a Bolton
178;00:14:55,097;00:14:58,049;by royal decree,
179;00:14:58,100;00:15:00,852;it's high time you married
179;00:14:58,100;00:15:00,852;a suitable bride.
180;00:15:04,606;00:15:06,441;And as it happens,
181;00:15:06,475;00:15:10,228;I've found the perfect girl to
181;00:15:06,475;00:15:10,228;solidify our hold on the North.
182;00:15:31,717;00:15:33,301;That's Moat Cailin.
183;00:15:33,335;00:15:36,804;Yes, a bit shabby, isn't it?
184;00:15:36,839;00:15:38,973;You've been here before?
185;00:15:39,007;00:15:40,925;On our way down
185;00:15:39,007;00:15:40,925;to King's Landing
186;00:15:40,976;00:15:43,811;with my father and Arya.
187;00:15:43,896;00:15:45,513;Where are you taking me?
188;00:15:45,564;00:15:47,181;Home.
189;00:15:48,600;00:15:50,768;The Boltons have Winterfell.
190;00:15:53,939;00:15:56,858;Your marriage proposal,
190;00:15:53,939;00:15:56,858;it wasn't for you.
191;00:15:58,026;00:16:00,027;No.
192;00:16:00,079;00:16:02,997;Roose Bolton
192;00:16:00,079;00:16:02,997;murdered my brother.
193;00:16:03,031;00:16:04,782;He betrayed my family.
194;00:16:04,784;00:16:06,250;He did.
195;00:16:06,285;00:16:08,086;He serves the Lannisters.
196;00:16:08,120;00:16:09,704;For now.
197;00:16:09,755;00:16:12,206;I won't go.
197;00:16:09,755;00:16:12,206;Winterfell is your home.
198;00:16:12,257;00:16:14,459;Not anymore.
198;00:16:12,257;00:16:14,459;Always.
199;00:16:14,461;00:16:17,545;You're a Stark. Dying your
199;00:16:14,461;00:16:17,545;hair doesn't change that.
200;00:16:17,596;00:16:22,049;You're Sansa Stark, eldest surviving
200;00:16:17,596;00:16:22,049;child of Ned and Catelyn Stark.
201;00:16:22,101;00:16:23,968;Your place is in the North.
202;00:16:24,019;00:16:25,970;I can't marry him.
202;00:16:24,019;00:16:25,970;You can't make me.
203;00:16:25,972;00:16:28,306;He is a traitor.
203;00:16:25,972;00:16:28,306;A murderer!
204;00:16:28,357;00:16:30,475;You're not marrying
204;00:16:28,357;00:16:30,475;Roose Bolton.
205;00:16:30,509;00:16:33,528;No, you'll be marrying
205;00:16:30,509;00:16:33,528;his son and heir Ramsay.
206;00:16:33,562;00:16:35,780;One day he'll be Warden
206;00:16:33,562;00:16:35,780;of the North and you--
207;00:16:35,814;00:16:36,948;No.
207;00:16:35,814;00:16:36,948;Sansa.
208;00:16:36,982;00:16:39,817;No, you can't make me.
208;00:16:36,982;00:16:39,817;I will starve myself.
209;00:16:39,819;00:16:41,903;I will die before
209;00:16:39,819;00:16:41,903;I have to go there.
210;00:16:41,954;00:16:45,039;I won't force you
210;00:16:41,954;00:16:45,039;to do anything.
211;00:16:45,073;00:16:47,492;Don't you know by now
211;00:16:45,073;00:16:47,492;how much I care for you?
212;00:16:48,827;00:16:50,461;Say the word and we turn
212;00:16:48,827;00:16:50,461;the horses around,
213;00:16:50,496;00:16:52,997;but listen to me.
213;00:16:50,496;00:16:52,997;Listen.
214;00:16:53,048;00:16:56,250;You've been running
214;00:16:53,048;00:16:56,250;all your life.
215;00:16:56,301;00:16:58,920;Terrible things happen to
215;00:16:56,301;00:16:58,920;your family and you weep.
216;00:16:58,971;00:17:02,673;You sit alone in a darkened
216;00:16:58,971;00:17:02,673;room mourning their fates.
217;00:17:02,724;00:17:06,677;You've been a bystander to tragedy from
217;00:17:02,724;00:17:06,677;the day they executed your father.
218;00:17:06,728;00:17:09,313;Stop being a bystander.
218;00:17:06,728;00:17:09,313;Do you hear me?
219;00:17:09,348;00:17:10,932;Stop running.
220;00:17:15,771;00:17:18,272;There's no justice in the world.
221;00:17:18,323;00:17:20,691;Not unless we make it.
222;00:17:22,194;00:17:24,328;You loved your family.
223;00:17:25,330;00:17:27,915;Avenge them.
224;00:18:09,576;00:18:11,409;Banners!
225;00:18:28,260;00:18:29,844;How do we get through there?
226;00:18:29,895;00:18:31,312;We don't.
227;00:18:31,346;00:18:33,264;We go around.
228;00:18:33,266;00:18:35,600;Takes us miles out of the way.
229;00:18:35,602;00:18:37,101;We'll lose sight of them.
230;00:18:37,103;00:18:38,436;Doesn't matter.
231;00:18:38,438;00:18:40,104;I know where they're going.
232;00:18:44,076;00:18:46,611;Aren't you getting
232;00:18:44,076;00:18:46,611;a bit old to be a squire?
233;00:18:50,925;00:18:53,059;How did you end up
233;00:18:50,925;00:18:53,059;squiring for the Imp?
234;00:18:53,359;00:18:55,143;He hates that nickname.
235;00:18:55,177;00:18:57,695;Well, he's not here
235;00:18:55,177;00:18:57,695;to complain about it, is he?
236;00:19:02,167;00:19:04,202;I squired for a knight
236;00:19:02,167;00:19:04,202;named Ser Lorimer
237;00:19:04,204;00:19:06,037;during the War
237;00:19:04,204;00:19:06,037;of the Five Kings.
238;00:19:06,088;00:19:09,040;One night he had
238;00:19:06,088;00:19:09,040;a bit too much to drink
239;00:19:09,042;00:19:11,676;and he was famished,
239;00:19:09,042;00:19:11,676;so he borrowed a ham.
240;00:19:11,710;00:19:12,606;He borrowed it?
241;00:19:12,726;00:19:13,790;He wasn't a thief.
242;00:19:14,064;00:19:16,714;He was drunk and hungry
242;00:19:14,064;00:19:16,714;and he wasn't thinking.
243;00:19:16,765;00:19:18,766;I was drunk, too.
244;00:19:18,801;00:19:21,019;He gave me half the ham.
245;00:19:22,098;00:19:26,274;Next morning, one of the
245;00:19:22,098;00:19:26,274;guards saw him passed out
246;00:19:26,308;00:19:29,627;under a wagon with the
246;00:19:26,308;00:19:29,627;hambone still in his hand.
247;00:19:30,381;00:19:32,447;They hanged him that afternoon.
248;00:19:33,615;00:19:34,899;They tied the noose for me, too,
249;00:19:34,901;00:19:37,773;but Lord Tywin heard
249;00:19:34,901;00:19:37,773;my family name was Payne,
250;00:19:37,893;00:19:39,570;so he pardoned me
251;00:19:39,572;00:19:41,735;and sent me to King's Landing
251;00:19:39,572;00:19:41,735;to squire for his son.
252;00:19:41,975;00:19:44,865;As punishment for both of you.
253;00:19:44,899;00:19:46,733;It didn't seem that way.
254;00:19:46,784;00:19:48,869;Lord Tyrion was always
254;00:19:46,784;00:19:48,869;very good to me.
255;00:19:48,903;00:19:51,071;Yes, all your lords
255;00:19:48,903;00:19:51,071;have been very kind to you.
256;00:19:51,122;00:19:52,656;All except me.
257;00:19:52,658;00:19:55,325;Sorry you had to squire
257;00:19:52,658;00:19:55,325;for such a nasty person.
258;00:19:55,327;00:19:58,462;I'm not sorry. You're the
258;00:19:55,327;00:19:58,462;best fighter I've ever seen.
259;00:19:58,496;00:20:00,881;You beat the Hound.
260;00:20:00,915;00:20:03,116;I'm proud to be your squire.
261;00:20:07,839;00:20:10,390;I'm sorry I'm always
261;00:20:07,839;00:20:10,390;snapping at you.
262;00:20:10,424;00:20:12,843;If you didn't snap at me,
262;00:20:10,424;00:20:12,843;I wouldn't learn anything.
263;00:20:16,681;00:20:19,015;You want to be a knight, Pod?
264;00:20:19,017;00:20:20,750;Yes.
265;00:20:20,785;00:20:23,570;Starting tomorrow, we'll train
265;00:20:20,785;00:20:23,570;with a sword twice a day.
266;00:20:23,604;00:20:27,190;Before we ride in the morning and
266;00:20:23,604;00:20:27,190;after you make camp in the evening.
267;00:20:27,241;00:20:30,193;And I'm going to show you
267;00:20:27,241;00:20:30,193;how to ride properly. - Thank you.
268;00:20:30,195;00:20:32,779;I can't knight you, but I
268;00:20:30,195;00:20:32,779;can teach you how to fight.
269;00:20:32,830;00:20:34,865;I suppose that's more important.
270;00:20:47,261;00:20:50,597;You weren't a knight,
270;00:20:47,261;00:20:50,597;but you were a Kingsguard
271;00:20:50,631;00:20:52,883;to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?
272;00:20:52,934;00:20:54,684;I was.
273;00:20:54,719;00:20:57,220;Lord Tyrion said
273;00:20:54,719;00:20:57,220;he was a good man.
274;00:20:59,223;00:21:00,941;He was.
275;00:21:02,226;00:21:04,060;How did you end up
275;00:21:02,226;00:21:04,060;serving Renly?
276;00:21:10,484;00:21:13,286;When I was a girl,
276;00:21:10,484;00:21:13,286;my father held a ball.
277;00:21:13,321;00:21:16,907;I'm his only living child, so he
277;00:21:13,321;00:21:16,907;wanted to make a good match for me.
278;00:21:16,958;00:21:19,576;He invited dozens
278;00:21:16,958;00:21:19,576;of young lords to Tarth.
279;00:21:19,627;00:21:22,712;I didn't want to go, but he
279;00:21:19,627;00:21:22,712;dragged me to the ballroom.
280;00:21:25,800;00:21:28,051;And it was wonderful.
281;00:21:29,971;00:21:34,424;None of the boys noticed
281;00:21:29,971;00:21:34,424;how mulish and tall I was.
282;00:21:34,475;00:21:36,893;They shoved each other
282;00:21:34,475;00:21:36,893;and threatened to duel
283;00:21:36,928;00:21:39,396;when they thought
283;00:21:36,928;00:21:39,396;it was their turn to dance.
284;00:21:40,681;00:21:42,482;They whispered in my ear
285;00:21:42,516;00:21:46,152;how they wanted to marry me and
285;00:21:42,516;00:21:46,152;take me back to their castles.
286;00:21:48,105;00:21:51,441;My father smiled at me
286;00:21:48,105;00:21:51,441;and I smiled at him.
287;00:21:53,160;00:21:55,445;I had never been so happy.
288;00:21:58,366;00:22:01,201;Till I saw a few
288;00:21:58,366;00:22:01,201;of the boys snickering.
289;00:22:02,954;00:22:04,704;And then they all
289;00:22:02,954;00:22:04,704;started to laugh.
290;00:22:04,755;00:22:07,507;They couldn't keep
290;00:22:04,755;00:22:07,507;the game going any longer.
291;00:22:07,541;00:22:09,793;They were toying with me.
292;00:22:11,012;00:22:13,013;Brienne the Beauty
292;00:22:11,012;00:22:13,013;they called me.
293;00:22:13,047;00:22:15,799;Great joke.
294;00:22:15,850;00:22:19,603;And I realized I was
294;00:22:15,850;00:22:19,603;the ugliest girl alive.
295;00:22:20,605;00:22:23,306;A great lumbering beast.
296;00:22:27,645;00:22:29,229;I tried to run away,
297;00:22:29,280;00:22:32,449;but Renly Baratheon
297;00:22:29,280;00:22:32,449;took me in his arms.
298;00:22:32,483;00:22:35,652;Don't let them see your
298;00:22:32,483;00:22:35,652;tears, he told me.
299;00:22:35,654;00:22:37,487;They're nasty little shits
300;00:22:37,489;00:22:41,491;and nasty little shits
300;00:22:37,489;00:22:41,491;aren't worth crying over.
301;00:22:41,493;00:22:44,661;He danced with me and none of the
301;00:22:41,493;00:22:44,661;other boys could say a word.
302;00:22:46,213;00:22:48,415;Renly was the king's
302;00:22:46,213;00:22:48,415;brother after all.
303;00:22:50,718;00:22:53,003;But wasn't he...?
304;00:22:54,388;00:22:57,724;Lord Tyrion said he was...
305;00:22:57,758;00:23:00,977;Yes, Pod, he liked men.
305;00:22:57,758;00:23:00,977;I'm not an idiot.
306;00:23:01,012;00:23:03,013;He didn't love me.
306;00:23:01,012;00:23:03,013;He didn't want me.
307;00:23:03,064;00:23:04,898;He danced with me
307;00:23:03,064;00:23:04,898;because he was kind
308;00:23:04,932;00:23:07,400;and didn't want to see me hurt.
309;00:23:07,435;00:23:10,603;He saved me from being a joke.
310;00:23:10,655;00:23:14,274;From that day
310;00:23:10,655;00:23:14,274;until his last day.
311;00:23:16,861;00:23:19,245;And I couldn't
311;00:23:16,861;00:23:19,245;save him in return.
312;00:23:22,700;00:23:26,419;Nothing's more hateful than failing
312;00:23:22,700;00:23:26,419;to protect the one you love.
313;00:23:28,255;00:23:31,508;One day I will avenge
313;00:23:28,255;00:23:31,508;King Renly.
314;00:23:31,542;00:23:34,511;But you said a shadow
314;00:23:31,542;00:23:34,511;murdered him.
315;00:23:34,545;00:23:35,929;How do you fight a shadow?
316;00:23:35,963;00:23:39,849;A shadow with the face
316;00:23:35,963;00:23:39,849;of Stannis Baratheon.
317;00:23:39,884;00:23:43,186;I know it was Stannis.
317;00:23:39,884;00:23:43,186;I know it in my heart.
318;00:23:46,607;00:23:48,975;Stannis is a man, not a shadow.
319;00:23:49,026;00:23:53,313;And a man can be killed.
320;00:23:55,983;00:23:58,561;Lord Commander.
320;00:23:55,983;00:23:58,561;Your Grace.
321;00:23:58,563;00:24:00,229;I'd like to speak alone.
322;00:24:00,280;00:24:02,782;Olly is my steward now
323;00:24:02,816;00:24:05,234;as I was
323;00:24:02,816;00:24:05,234;Lord Commander Mormont's.
324;00:24:05,285;00:24:10,073;I want him to attend my meetings
324;00:24:05,285;00:24:10,073;to learn from men with experience.
325;00:24:11,575;00:24:13,676;One day he might command.
326;00:24:17,331;00:24:18,581;Very well.
327;00:24:18,583;00:24:20,717;Have you considered my offer?
328;00:24:21,802;00:24:23,469;I have.
329;00:24:23,504;00:24:26,222;And I thank you for it.
329;00:24:23,504;00:24:26,222;You do me great honor.
330;00:24:26,256;00:24:29,008;All my life I wanted
330;00:24:26,256;00:24:29,008;to be Jon Stark.
331;00:24:29,059;00:24:30,893;Say the word and you will be.
332;00:24:32,596;00:24:34,597;But I have to refuse you.
333;00:24:35,983;00:24:38,518;I'm Lord Commander
333;00:24:35,983;00:24:38,518;of the Night's Watch.
334;00:24:38,569;00:24:40,486;My place is here.
335;00:24:40,521;00:24:43,856;I'm giving you the chance
335;00:24:40,521;00:24:43,856;to avenge your family,
336;00:24:43,891;00:24:46,676;to take back the castle
336;00:24:43,891;00:24:46,676;where you grew up.
337;00:24:48,529;00:24:50,947;To rule the North.
338;00:24:50,949;00:24:53,099;I wish I could fight beside you.
339;00:24:53,133;00:24:55,368;Believe me, I do.
340;00:24:55,419;00:24:58,421;But I swore a sacred vow
340;00:24:55,419;00:24:58,421;at the godswood.
341;00:24:58,455;00:25:01,691;I pledged my life
341;00:24:58,455;00:25:01,691;to the Night's Watch.
342;00:25:01,725;00:25:06,323;You're as stubborn
342;00:25:01,725;00:25:06,323;as your father.
343;00:25:06,358;00:25:08,075;I can imagine no higher praise.
344;00:25:08,126;00:25:09,827;I didn't mean it as praise.
345;00:25:09,829;00:25:12,496;Honor got your father killed.
346;00:25:12,547;00:25:14,498;But if your mind's made up,
346;00:25:12,547;00:25:14,498;I won't try and dissuade you.
347;00:25:14,549;00:25:18,052;May I ask, Your Grace, how long
347;00:25:14,549;00:25:18,052;you plan to stay at Castle Black?
348;00:25:18,086;00:25:19,887;Are you bored of us already?
349;00:25:21,173;00:25:23,424;You saved us
349;00:25:21,173;00:25:23,424;from Mance Rayder's army.
350;00:25:23,475;00:25:24,675;We will never forget that.
351;00:25:24,726;00:25:27,094;But it's a question of survival.
352;00:25:27,145;00:25:29,680;The Night's Watch can't
352;00:25:27,145;00:25:29,680;continue to feed your men
353;00:25:29,731;00:25:32,933;and the wildling
353;00:25:29,731;00:25:32,933;prisoners indefinitely.
354;00:25:32,984;00:25:34,685;Winter is coming.
355;00:25:36,021;00:25:37,655;I know it.
356;00:25:37,689;00:25:39,857;We march on Winterfell
356;00:25:37,689;00:25:39,857;within the fortnight,
357;00:25:39,908;00:25:42,076;before the snows trap us here.
358;00:25:43,328;00:25:44,612;And the wildlings?
359;00:25:44,663;00:25:46,997;If they'd rather burn than
359;00:25:44,663;00:25:46,997;fight for me, so be it.
360;00:25:47,032;00:25:49,083;I leave their fate to you.
361;00:25:49,117;00:25:52,369;You could execute them.
361;00:25:49,117;00:25:52,369;That's the safest course.
362;00:25:56,258;00:25:58,459;Or you could see
362;00:25:56,258;00:25:58,459;if this Tormund fellow
363;00:25:58,510;00:26:01,045;is more willing to compromise
363;00:25:58,510;00:26:01,045;than Mance ever was.
364;00:26:01,096;00:26:02,680;I assume the brothers
364;00:26:01,096;00:26:02,680;of the Night's Watch
365;00:26:02,714;00:26:04,882;would rather see
365;00:26:02,714;00:26:04,882;the wildlings dead.
366;00:26:04,933;00:26:07,718;Most of the brothers, yes.
367;00:26:07,720;00:26:10,020;There's little love
367;00:26:07,720;00:26:10,020;for the free folk here.
368;00:26:10,055;00:26:13,862;You're the Lord Commander.
368;00:26:10,055;00:26:13,862;Your decision.
369;00:26:15,281;00:26:16,815;You have many enemies
369;00:26:15,281;00:26:16,815;in Castle Black.
370;00:26:16,866;00:26:20,034;Have you considered sending
370;00:26:16,866;00:26:20,034;Alliser Thorne elsewhere?
371;00:26:21,320;00:26:23,655;Give him command
371;00:26:21,320;00:26:23,655;of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
372;00:26:23,706;00:26:26,324;I heard it was best
372;00:26:23,706;00:26:26,324;to keep your enemies close.
373;00:26:26,375;00:26:28,827;Whoever said that
373;00:26:26,375;00:26:28,827;didn't have many enemies.
374;00:26:36,552;00:26:39,304;He sees something in you.
375;00:26:39,338;00:26:42,590;Might not be apparent
375;00:26:39,338;00:26:42,590;from his tone,
376;00:26:42,641;00:26:44,092;but it's the truth.
377;00:26:44,143;00:26:45,260;He believes in you.
378;00:26:45,311;00:26:47,762;I'm sorry I disappointed him.
379;00:26:51,567;00:26:55,103;The king is a complicated man,
380;00:26:55,105;00:26:57,488;but he wants to do what's
380;00:26:55,105;00:26:57,488;right for the Seven Kingdoms.
381;00:26:57,523;00:26:58,940;As long as he's ruling them.
382;00:26:58,991;00:27:01,342;He's the one true king.
383;00:27:01,377;00:27:03,578;He has a blood right
383;00:27:01,377;00:27:03,578;to that throne.
384;00:27:03,612;00:27:07,115;I've sworn to stay clear of the
384;00:27:03,612;00:27:07,115;politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
385;00:27:07,166;00:27:08,783;Have you now?
386;00:27:11,620;00:27:14,205;How does the Night's
386;00:27:11,620;00:27:14,205;Watch vow go again?
387;00:27:14,256;00:27:16,791;I'll bet you've got it
387;00:27:14,256;00:27:16,791;memorized since you got here.
388;00:27:19,628;00:27:21,880;Night gathers
388;00:27:19,628;00:27:21,880;and now my watch begins.
389;00:27:21,931;00:27:25,133;No, not that bit.
389;00:27:21,931;00:27:25,133;The bit at the end.
390;00:27:25,135;00:27:27,802;I am the sword in the darkness,
391;00:27:27,853;00:27:29,637;the watcher on the walls,
392;00:27:29,639;00:27:31,723;the shield that guards
392;00:27:29,639;00:27:31,723;the realms of men.
393;00:27:31,774;00:27:34,275;I pledge my life--
393;00:27:31,774;00:27:34,275;Right, that's enough.
394;00:27:34,310;00:27:36,978;The shield that guards
394;00:27:34,310;00:27:36,978;the realms of men.
395;00:27:37,029;00:27:38,363;That's what you swore to be.
396;00:27:38,397;00:27:40,431;Now, I'm not a learned man,
397;00:27:40,466;00:27:42,867;but the best way to help the
397;00:27:40,466;00:27:42,867;most people might not be sitting
398;00:27:42,902;00:27:45,119;in a frozen castle
398;00:27:42,902;00:27:45,119;at the edge of the world.
399;00:27:45,154;00:27:47,372;It just might mean
399;00:27:45,154;00:27:47,372;wading in the muck,
400;00:27:47,406;00:27:49,157;getting your boots dirty
401;00:27:49,208;00:27:51,075;and doing what needs to be done.
402;00:27:51,126;00:27:52,660;And what needs to be done?
403;00:27:52,662;00:27:54,829;As long as the Boltons
403;00:27:52,662;00:27:54,829;rule the North,
404;00:27:54,880;00:27:56,664;the North will suffer.
405;00:27:57,716;00:27:59,834;Just one man's opinion.
406;00:28:29,183;00:28:30,684;What do you want?
407;00:28:30,735;00:28:32,519;Who are you?
408;00:28:34,062;00:28:36,573;What?
408;00:28:34,062;00:28:36,573;You, who walk in here
409;00:28:36,607;00:28:37,896;with a coin you never earned
410;00:28:38,010;00:28:40,178;whose value you do not respect.
411;00:28:45,518;00:28:46,801;Who are you?
412;00:28:49,522;00:28:50,855;No one.
413;00:28:50,906;00:28:53,158;Ow! Cunt!
414;00:28:53,192;00:28:55,493;A lie. A sad little lie.
414;00:28:53,192;00:28:55,493;Who are you?
415;00:28:55,528;00:28:57,245;I told you, I'm no--
416;00:28:57,279;00:28:59,697;Do that again, and--
417;00:28:59,699;00:29:01,232;Who are you?
418;00:29:01,267;00:29:03,535;You're about to find out.
419;00:29:04,587;00:29:06,504;What are you doing?
420;00:29:06,539;00:29:09,257;We were only playing.
420;00:29:06,539;00:29:09,257;The Game of Faces.

421;00:29:09,291;00:29:11,926;Clearly not.
422;00:29:11,961;00:29:14,462;I am ready!
423;00:29:14,513;00:29:16,014;For what?
424;00:29:16,048;00:29:17,699;For whatever you want.
425;00:29:17,733;00:29:20,685;To be a Faceless Man.
425;00:29:17,733;00:29:20,685;To be no one.
426;00:29:24,957;00:29:27,559;Whose sword is that?
427;00:29:27,593;00:29:29,093;It belongs to Arya Stark.

430;00:29:33,465;00:29:37,719;A man wonders
430;00:29:33,465;00:29:37,719;how is it that no one
431;00:29:37,753;00:29:41,039;came to be surrounded
431;00:29:37,753;00:29:41,039;by Arya Stark's things.
432;00:33:45,193;00:33:47,878;What do we do with them
432;00:33:45,193;00:33:47,878;after we wash them?
433;00:34:18,810;00:34:21,395;Open gate!

441;00:35:33,084;00:35:34,752;You must want to wash.
442;00:35:34,754;00:35:37,137;Thank you.

449;00:36:08,119;00:36:09,703;Take good care of him.
450;00:36:11,289;00:36:13,791;Brothers.

455;00:36:36,531;00:36:38,315;Seems like a good job
455;00:36:36,531;00:36:38,315;for a ginger.
456;00:36:42,987;00:36:45,289;That's him!
456;00:36:42,987;00:36:45,289;That's him.

464;00:37:13,351;00:37:15,185;I'm giving you command
464;00:37:13,351;00:37:15,185;of Greyguard.
465;00:37:16,488;00:37:18,188;Greyguard is a ruin.
466;00:37:18,239;00:37:20,274;Yes, the fort
466;00:37:18,239;00:37:20,274;is in a sorry state.
467;00:37:20,325;00:37:21,942;Restore it as best you can.

470;00:37:25,763;00:37:27,831;your swaddling clothes.
471;00:37:27,866;00:37:28,999;Keep your ruin.

473;00:37:34,373;00:37:36,173;Enough of that.
474;00:37:36,207;00:37:38,041;You mistake me, my lord.
475;00:37:39,611;00:37:42,429;That was a command,
475;00:37:39,611;00:37:42,429;not an offer.
476;00:37:42,463;00:37:46,433;Pack your arms and armor,

478;00:37:50,855;00:37:53,891;I will not go meekly off
478;00:37:50,855;00:37:53,891;to freeze and die.
479;00:37:53,893;00:37:56,894;Give it to one of the fools
479;00:37:53,893;00:37:56,894;who cast a stone for you.
480;00:37:56,945;00:37:59,696;I will not have it.
480;00:37:56,945;00:37:59,696;Did you hear me, boy?
481;00:37:59,731;00:38:01,365;I will not have it!
482;00:38:01,399;00:38:04,234;Are you refusing
482;00:38:01,399;00:38:04,234;to obey my order?
483;00:38:09,626;00:38:12,961;You can stick your order

484;00:38:20,086;00:38:21,887;Take Lord Janos outside.
485;00:38:24,307;00:38:25,924;Olly, bring me my sword.

487;00:38:49,866;00:38:51,500;Get your hands off me!
488;00:38:51,534;00:38:53,669;Scum, all of you!
489;00:38:58,007;00:39:00,926;If the boy thinks he can
489;00:38:58,007;00:39:00,926;frighten me, he's mistaken.
490;00:39:00,960;00:39:03,011;Yes, very mistaken.
491;00:39:04,797;00:39:06,598;Disgrace!
492;00:39:06,633;00:39:07,883;I have friends.

500;00:40:03,523;00:40:06,024;I was wrong.

532;00:42:40,170;00:42:43,472;is an insult to the gods.

534;00:42:46,142;00:42:48,009;on our very religion.
535;00:42:48,060;00:42:49,511;You were assaulted?
535;00:42:48,060;00:42:49,511;I was.
536;00:42:49,513;00:42:51,930;By those fanatics

544;00:43:11,117;00:43:15,086;So you were ministering to the
544;00:43:11,117;00:43:15,086;needs of these devout prostitutes?
545;00:43:15,121;00:43:17,923;A man's private affairs
545;00:43:15,121;00:43:17,923;ought to stay private.
546;00:43:19,642;00:43:21,710;What do you want from us,
546;00:43:19,642;00:43:21,710;High Septon?
547;00:43:21,712;00:43:24,379;Justice. I ask that
547;00:43:21,712;00:43:24,379;you protect our faith
548;00:43:24,430;00:43:28,133;by arresting these criminals and
548;00:43:24,430;00:43:28,133;throwing them in the black cells.
549;00:43:28,167;00:43:30,185;I ask that you execute
549;00:43:28,167;00:43:30,185;their leader,
550;00:43:30,219;00:43:32,354;this so-called
550;00:43:30,219;00:43:32,354;High Sparrow.
551;00:43:32,388;00:43:34,356;He's a threat to everything
551;00:43:32,388;00:43:34,356;we hold sacred.
552;00:43:34,390;00:43:37,526;If he goes unpunished--
552;00:43:34,390;00:43:37,526;And where do I find this man?
553;00:43:37,560;00:43:39,561;This High Sparrow?
554;00:43:49,072;00:43:51,206;I don't think this is
554;00:43:49,072;00:43:51,206;a good idea, Your Grace.
555;00:43:51,241;00:43:54,243;Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These
555;00:43:51,241;00:43:54,243;are deeply religious people.
556;00:43:54,245;00:43:56,662;Where can I find
556;00:43:54,245;00:43:56,662;the High Sparrow?
557;00:43:58,915;00:44:00,382;Seven blessings.
558;00:44:12,846;00:44:15,097;- Thank you.
558;00:44:12,846;00:44:15,097;- Just a little more.
559;00:44:16,900;00:44:18,767;Thank you.
560;00:44:20,654;00:44:23,272;Thank you.
561;00:44:23,323;00:44:25,774;A young man said I'd find
561;00:44:23,323;00:44:25,774;the High Sparrow back here.
562;00:44:25,825;00:44:28,610;Where is he?
562;00:44:25,825;00:44:28,610;High Sparrow?
563;00:44:28,662;00:44:30,362;Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?
564;00:44:30,413;00:44:33,732;Like Lord Duckling
564;00:44:30,413;00:44:33,732;or King Turtle.
565;00:44:33,767;00:44:35,751;Still, it's meant to.
566;00:44:35,785;00:44:39,004;We're often stuck with the
566;00:44:35,785;00:44:39,004;names our enemies give to us.
567;00:44:39,039;00:44:42,341;The notion that we're all equal
567;00:44:39,039;00:44:42,341;in the eyes of the Seven
568;00:44:42,375;00:44:44,293;doesn't sit well with some,
569;00:44:44,344;00:44:47,293;so they belittle me.
570;00:44:47,295;00:44:49,796;Seven blessings to you, my dear.
571;00:44:49,847;00:44:51,264;It's only a name.
572;00:44:51,298;00:44:53,633;Quite an easy burden to bear.
573;00:44:53,684;00:44:55,802;Far easier than hers.
574;00:44:58,605;00:45:00,356;Why no shoes?
575;00:45:00,391;00:45:04,060;Because I gave them away to
575;00:45:00,391;00:45:04,060;someone who needed them more.
576;00:45:04,111;00:45:05,395;We all do that.
577;00:45:05,446;00:45:09,315;It stops us from forgetting
577;00:45:05,446;00:45:09,315;what we really are.
578;00:45:09,366;00:45:11,985;Is that why you came
578;00:45:09,366;00:45:11,985;to King's Landing?
579;00:45:11,987;00:45:13,403;To remind everyone?
580;00:45:13,454;00:45:16,656;Everyone? Hard enough
580;00:45:13,454;00:45:16,656;job reminding myself.
581;00:45:16,707;00:45:18,825;Well, I tell them
581;00:45:16,707;00:45:18,825;no one's special
582;00:45:18,876;00:45:21,494;and they think I'm special
582;00:45:18,876;00:45:21,494;for telling them so.
583;00:45:23,130;00:45:25,381;Perhaps they're right.
584;00:45:25,416;00:45:28,334;It would be comforting to
584;00:45:25,416;00:45:28,334;believe that, wouldn't it?
585;00:45:29,503;00:45:33,172;Have the gods sent
585;00:45:29,503;00:45:33,172;you here to tempt me?
586;00:45:33,223;00:45:35,475;I hope not.
587;00:45:35,509;00:45:39,846;I had assumed you'd only
587;00:45:35,509;00:45:39,846;come here to arrest me
588;00:45:39,848;00:45:42,565;for that incident
588;00:45:39,848;00:45:42,565;with the High Septon.
589;00:45:42,599;00:45:45,318;An unacceptable way to treat
589;00:45:42,599;00:45:45,318;the chosen representative
590;00:45:45,352;00:45:47,854;of the gods in this world,
590;00:45:45,352;00:45:47,854;wouldn't you say?
591;00:45:47,905;00:45:50,323;Hypocrisy is a boil.
592;00:45:50,357;00:45:53,096;Lancing a boil
592;00:45:50,357;00:45:53,096;is never pleasant.
593;00:45:54,030;00:45:57,133;Although they could have been more careful
593;00:45:54,030;00:45:57,133;with the blade.
594;00:45:57,520;00:46:00,655;The High Septon came
594;00:45:57,520;00:46:00,655;to speak to me today.
595;00:46:02,274;00:46:03,554;He doesn't want me
595;00:46:02,274;00:46:03,554;to arrest you.
596;00:46:03,575;00:46:05,109;He wants me to execute you.
597;00:46:07,579;00:46:10,415;I wouldn't presume to know
597;00:46:07,579;00:46:10,415;your thoughts on the matter.
598;00:46:14,787;00:46:17,088;My thoughts on the matter
598;00:46:14,787;00:46:17,088;are in line with your own.
599;00:46:17,122;00:46:21,542;The High Septon's behavior was
599;00:46:17,122;00:46:21,542;corrosive, as was his attitude.
600;00:46:21,544;00:46:25,463;Having a man like that reside in the sept
600;00:46:21,544;00:46:25,463;eats away at the faith from the inside.
601;00:46:26,849;00:46:30,051;So now he resides in the
601;00:46:26,849;00:46:30,051;Red Keep dungeons instead.
602;00:46:31,687;00:46:33,705;The faith and the crown
602;00:46:31,687;00:46:33,705;are the two pillars
603;00:46:33,739;00:46:35,189;that hold up this world.
604;00:46:35,224;00:46:37,392;One collapses,
604;00:46:35,224;00:46:37,392;so does the other.
605;00:46:39,111;00:46:43,231;We must do everything necessary
605;00:46:39,111;00:46:43,231;to protect one another.
606;00:47:01,750;00:47:04,252;Your Grace.
606;00:47:01,750;00:47:04,252;Send a raven with this message
607;00:47:04,303;00:47:07,755;to Littlefinger at the Eyrie or
607;00:47:04,303;00:47:07,755;wherever he's slithering about.
608;00:47:10,759;00:47:12,677;At once, Your Grace.
609;00:47:13,712;00:47:14,979;How's your work coming along?
610;00:47:15,013;00:47:16,514;Very well.
611;00:47:16,565;00:47:18,099;You've made progress?
612;00:47:18,101;00:47:19,767;More than I expected.
613;00:47:19,769;00:47:22,687;Still a way to go, but...
613;00:47:19,769;00:47:22,687;Very good.
614;00:47:22,738;00:47:24,439;I'll leave you to it, then.
615;00:47:24,441;00:47:28,776;Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the
615;00:47:24,441;00:47:28,776;meaning of the word immediately.
616;00:47:44,760;00:47:46,844;Shh.
617;00:47:48,046;00:47:49,964;Easy, friend.
618;00:48:13,205;00:48:15,239;She really is lovely.
619;00:48:15,274;00:48:17,909;I hope I can make her happy.
620;00:48:17,943;00:48:20,461;I hope so, too.
621;00:48:20,496;00:48:23,998;I've become quite fond of Lady
621;00:48:20,496;00:48:23,998;Sansa during our travels together.
622;00:48:24,049;00:48:26,334;She's suffered enough.
623;00:48:26,385;00:48:28,302;I'll never hurt her.
624;00:48:28,337;00:48:29,971;You have my word.
625;00:48:32,341;00:48:34,759;I've heard very little
625;00:48:32,341;00:48:34,759;about you,
626;00:48:34,810;00:48:38,179;which makes you quite a
626;00:48:34,810;00:48:38,179;rare thing as lords go.
627;00:48:39,348;00:48:41,732;I haven't been a lord very long.
628;00:48:41,767;00:48:43,601;I was a bastard.
629;00:48:43,652;00:48:46,020;And you're not anymore.
630;00:48:46,071;00:48:48,856;Allow me a moment alone
630;00:48:46,071;00:48:48,856;with Lord Baelish.
631;00:48:48,858;00:48:50,408;Yes, Father.
632;00:48:50,442;00:48:51,993;And thank you, Lord Baelish.
633;00:48:52,027;00:48:54,445;I'm forever in your debt.
634;00:49:00,335;00:49:02,370;He seems pleased.
635;00:49:02,372;00:49:04,872;Shouldn't he be?
636;00:49:04,874;00:49:06,841;I assure you,
636;00:49:04,874;00:49:06,841;she's still a virgin.
637;00:49:06,875;00:49:09,093;Tyrion never consummated
637;00:49:06,875;00:49:09,093;the marriage.
638;00:49:09,127;00:49:11,712;By the law of the land,
638;00:49:09,127;00:49:11,712;she is no man's wife.
639;00:49:12,714;00:49:14,265;Inspect her if you must.
640;00:49:14,299;00:49:15,967;I'll leave that
640;00:49:14,299;00:49:15,967;to the brothel keeper.
641;00:49:16,018;00:49:18,052;It's her name I need,
641;00:49:16,018;00:49:18,052;not her virtue.
642;00:49:18,103;00:49:20,721;Then I have delivered
642;00:49:18,103;00:49:20,721;everything I promised.
643;00:49:21,974;00:49:24,225;And you're prepared
643;00:49:21,974;00:49:24,225;for the consequences
644;00:49:24,276;00:49:26,811;when the Lannisters hear I've
644;00:49:24,276;00:49:26,811;wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay?
645;00:49:26,862;00:49:29,614;The Lannister name doesn't
645;00:49:26,862;00:49:29,614;mean what it once did.
646;00:49:29,648;00:49:31,482;Tywin is dead.
647;00:49:31,533;00:49:33,901;He kept his house in power
647;00:49:31,533;00:49:33,901;through sheer will.
648;00:49:33,952;00:49:37,572;Without him, Jaime has
648;00:49:33,952;00:49:37,572;one hand and no allies.
649;00:49:37,623;00:49:39,740;Tommen is a soft boy,
650;00:49:39,791;00:49:42,043;not a king to fear.
651;00:49:42,077;00:49:43,895;The queen will be enraged.
652;00:49:43,929;00:49:46,914;Queen Margaery adores Sansa.
653;00:49:46,916;00:49:48,716;Cersei is Queen Mother,
654;00:49:48,750;00:49:51,586;a title whose importance
654;00:49:48,750;00:49:51,586;wanes with each passing day.
655;00:49:51,588;00:49:53,421;And yet she still has friends,
656;00:49:53,472;00:49:56,891;men in important places whom
656;00:49:53,472;00:49:56,891;she can ask for favors.
657;00:49:56,925;00:50:00,761;A message for you
657;00:49:56,925;00:50:00,761;from Cersei Lannister.
658;00:50:00,812;00:50:04,098;A rider arrived from the
658;00:50:00,812;00:50:04,098;Eyrie shortly before dawn.
659;00:50:04,100;00:50:06,328;Apparently she thinks
659;00:50:04,100;00:50:06,328;you're still in the Vale.
660;00:50:06,362;00:50:09,614;A message for me you say?
661;00:50:09,616;00:50:11,499;Strange that the seal is broken.
662;00:50:11,534;00:50:13,752;I'm sure you understand
662;00:50:11,534;00:50:13,752;my position, Lord Baelish.
663;00:50:13,786;00:50:16,705;If you receive word in the
663;00:50:13,786;00:50:16,705;night from the Queen Mother,
664;00:50:16,756;00:50:19,624;it does make me question
664;00:50:16,756;00:50:19,624;our new alliance.
665;00:50:19,626;00:50:23,712;The Lannisters made you one of
665;00:50:19,626;00:50:23,712;the great lords of Westeros,
666;00:50:23,763;00:50:26,765;yet here you are in the
666;00:50:23,763;00:50:26,765;North undermining them.
667;00:50:26,799;00:50:28,633;Why gamble with your position?
668;00:50:30,136;00:50:32,304;Every ambitious move
668;00:50:30,136;00:50:32,304;is a gamble.
669;00:50:32,355;00:50:36,057;You gambled when you drove a
669;00:50:32,355;00:50:36,057;dagger into Robb Stark's heart.
670;00:50:38,311;00:50:40,362;It appears that
670;00:50:38,311;00:50:40,362;your gamble paid off.
671;00:50:40,396;00:50:42,147;You're Warden of the North.
672;00:50:42,149;00:50:44,032;I had Tywin Lannister's backing.
673;00:50:44,066;00:50:46,618;Who supports me now?
673;00:50:44,066;00:50:46,618;You?
674;00:50:46,652;00:50:49,070;The Eyrie is mine.
675;00:50:49,121;00:50:51,239;The last time
675;00:50:49,121;00:50:51,239;the lords of the Eyrie
676;00:50:51,290;00:50:53,825;formed an alliance
676;00:50:51,290;00:50:53,825;with the lords of the North,
677;00:50:53,827;00:50:56,995;they brought down the greatest
677;00:50:53,827;00:50:56,995;dynasty this world has ever known.
678;00:50:59,915;00:51:02,834;I'd like to borrow
678;00:50:59,915;00:51:02,834;one of your birds.
679;00:51:02,885;00:51:05,003;Cersei will expect a reply.
680;00:51:05,005;00:51:07,505;I'd like to read the reply.
681;00:51:29,745;00:51:32,030;I have to get out
681;00:51:29,745;00:51:32,030;of this wheelhouse.
682;00:51:32,081;00:51:33,415;Volantis is a large city.

683;00:51:33,449;00:51:35,583;of this wheelhouse.

684;00:51:35,618;00:51:39,120;here increases a hundredfold.
685;00:51:39,171;00:51:41,373;Mm, I have to get out
685;00:51:39,171;00:51:41,373;of this wheelhouse.
686;00:51:41,375;00:51:44,342;I'm not sure how many new
686;00:51:41,375;00:51:44,342;ways I can find of saying this.
687;00:51:48,047;00:51:51,599;I will not be of any use
687;00:51:48,047;00:51:51,599;to Daenerys Targaryen
688;00:51:51,634;00:51:53,718;if I lose my mind.

689;00:51:53,720;00:51:56,938;face I saw that wasn't yours.
690;00:51:56,972;00:51:58,773;It's a perfectly good face.
691;00:51:58,808;00:52:00,692;I am losing my mind.
692;00:52:00,726;00:52:03,111;If anyone recognizes you,
692;00:52:00,726;00:52:03,111;you'll lose more than that.
693;00:52:03,145;00:52:05,980;Look, we are thousands
693;00:52:03,145;00:52:05,980;of miles from Westeros.
694;00:52:08,734;00:52:10,985;What am I?
695;00:52:11,037;00:52:12,987;One more drunk dwarf.
696;00:52:14,240;00:52:16,741;Whoa!
697;00:52:42,651;00:52:43,818;We have to go now.

698;00:52:43,853;00:52:45,854;Hold it.
699;00:52:45,905;00:52:47,522;Are you ready?
700;00:52:49,442;00:52:51,109;Slaves.
701;00:52:51,160;00:52:55,029;Yes, the Volantene masters
701;00:52:51,160;00:52:55,029;are very organized.
702;00:52:55,948;00:52:58,600;Flies for dung shovelers.
703;00:52:58,634;00:53:00,952;Hammers for builders.
704;00:53:00,954;00:53:03,455;Tears for whores.
705;00:53:03,457;00:53:05,507;Lest they forget.

714;00:53:40,409;00:53:42,043;much better-looking.

718;00:53:51,253;00:53:54,756;of greyscale with prayer.
719;00:53:54,807;00:53:57,175;You'd have better luck
719;00:53:54,807;00:53:57,175;dancing away the plague.
720;00:53:57,226;00:53:58,760;Shh.

725;00:54:10,940;00:54:13,691;to meet the savior?

731;00:55:04,410;00:55:07,078;We blend right in.
732;00:55:07,080;00:55:10,582;Just two more travelers
732;00:55:07,080;00:55:10,582;mad with lust.
733;00:55:15,087;00:55:16,671;Thank you.
734;00:55:25,731;00:55:27,765;What curious hair.
735;00:55:29,435;00:55:31,603;The Mother of Dragons!
736;00:55:34,073;00:55:36,824;It appears you're not
736;00:55:34,073;00:55:36,824;the only Targaryen supporter.
737;00:55:38,277;00:55:40,194;We were just heading
737;00:55:38,277;00:55:40,194;east to see you.
738;00:55:40,246;00:55:41,913;I've got a dragon for you.
739;00:55:41,947;00:55:44,249;How much to make him spit fire?
740;00:55:47,786;00:55:50,788;Someone who inspires
740;00:55:47,786;00:55:50,788;priests and whores
741;00:55:50,790;00:55:52,257;is worth taking seriously.
742;00:55:52,291;00:55:53,791;What makes you worth that much?
743;00:55:53,842;00:55:56,127;I'm magic.
743;00:55:53,842;00:55:56,127;I'll bet you bloody are.
744;00:55:59,431;00:56:01,849;Well, she's taken.
745;00:56:03,302;00:56:04,769;Where are you going?
746;00:56:04,803;00:56:07,355;I need to speak
746;00:56:04,803;00:56:07,355;to someone with hair.
747;00:56:09,275;00:56:11,559;Hello.
747;00:56:09,275;00:56:11,559;Hello.
748;00:56:11,610;00:56:13,978;You've got no drink.
748;00:56:11,610;00:56:13,978;You've got no money.
749;00:56:13,980;00:56:16,281;Do I look like
749;00:56:13,980;00:56:16,281;a man without money?
750;00:56:17,900;00:56:19,651;Never trust looks.
751;00:56:19,653;00:56:22,954;Until quite recently, I was one
751;00:56:19,653;00:56:22,954;of the richest men in the world.
752;00:56:24,873;00:56:28,126;Who needs wealth when you
752;00:56:24,873;00:56:28,126;can make a woman laugh?
753;00:56:30,245;00:56:32,580;I always pay my debts.
754;00:56:32,631;00:56:34,048;I'm well known for it.
755;00:56:38,754;00:56:41,389;You like her.
756;00:56:41,423;00:56:43,174;They all like her.
757;00:56:43,225;00:56:44,676;They all want to fuck a queen.
758;00:56:44,678;00:56:46,511;That's because
758;00:56:44,678;00:56:46,511;they've never met a queen.
759;00:56:46,562;00:56:47,979;You're just saying that.
760;00:56:48,013;00:56:50,431;You know how to spot a liar.
761;00:56:50,482;00:56:52,934;If I could pick any girl here,
762;00:56:52,985;00:56:55,486;I would pick you.
763;00:56:55,521;00:56:57,021;Why?
764;00:56:57,023;00:56:59,490;Because you have
764;00:56:57,023;00:56:59,490;a skeptical mind.
765;00:57:03,862;00:57:05,863;All right, then.
765;00:57:03,862;00:57:05,863;I'm warning you,
766;00:57:05,865;00:57:08,366;we're going to have
766;00:57:05,865;00:57:08,366;to wash you first.
767;00:57:08,417;00:57:09,834;Come on.
768;00:57:17,426;00:57:20,428;I'm-- I'm sorry,
768;00:57:17,426;00:57:20,428;I can't.
769;00:57:21,513;00:57:24,515;Of course you can.
769;00:57:21,513;00:57:24,515;You're shy.
770;00:57:24,550;00:57:26,467;I'm not.
771;00:57:28,053;00:57:29,520;Have another drink.
772;00:57:29,555;00:57:32,473;Gladly, but this I can't do.
773;00:57:32,524;00:57:35,526;Believe me, no one is
773;00:57:32,524;00:57:35,526;more shocked than I am.
774;00:57:35,561;00:57:38,062;I hope it passes.
775;00:57:38,113;00:57:40,732;What will I do in my spare time?
776;00:57:43,369;00:57:46,320;Go for a piss.
776;00:57:43,369;00:57:46,320;That's a start.
777;00:58:04,640;00:58:07,225;No need to worry.
777;00:58:04,640;00:58:07,225;I was just--
778;00:58:07,259;00:58:10,978;Oh, I thought
778;00:58:07,259;00:58:10,978;you were someone else.
779;00:58:11,897;00:58:13,431;Show's almost over.
780;00:58:13,482;00:58:17,068;I'm sure there are girls inside
780;00:58:13,482;00:58:17,068;who'd be happy to oblige.
781;00:58:18,320;00:58:19,647;You've made
781;00:58:18,320;00:58:19,647;some kind of mistake.
782;00:58:19,767;00:58:22,690;Why don't you tell me what you
782;00:58:19,767;00:58:22,690;think you're doing and then--
783;00:58:23,814;00:58:26,277;I'm taking you to the queen.
