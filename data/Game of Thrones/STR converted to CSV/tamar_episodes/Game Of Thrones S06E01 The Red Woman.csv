4;00:03:27,009;00:03:29,143;It's coming
4;00:03:27,009;00:03:29,143;from the courtyard.
5;00:03:34,317;00:03:36,650;It's the Lord Commander!
6;00:03:49,916;00:03:51,699;Help me get him inside.
7;00:04:46,756;00:04:48,923;Thorne did this.
8;00:04:53,179;00:04:56,397;How many of your brothers
8;00:04:53,179;00:04:56,397;do you think you can trust?
9;00:04:56,482;00:04:58,098;Trust?
10;00:05:01,320;00:05:02,570;The men in this room.
11;00:05:03,906;00:05:06,524;Does the wolf know you?
12;00:05:06,609;00:05:08,609;We need all the help
12;00:05:06,609;00:05:08,609;we can get.
13;00:05:15,117;00:05:16,951;Ser Davos.
14;00:05:58,461;00:06:01,829;I saw him in the flames
15;00:06:01,964;00:06:04,081;fighting at Winterfell.
16;00:06:08,087;00:06:10,254;I can't speak
16;00:06:08,087;00:06:10,254;for the flames...
17;00:06:12,174;00:06:13,974;but he's gone.
18;00:06:34,163;00:06:35,863;He was our Lord Commander.
19;00:06:35,948;00:06:37,781;He never should have been!
20;00:06:41,420;00:06:43,460;You all know why you're here.
21;00:06:46,709;00:06:49,259;Jon Snow is dead.
22;00:06:49,378;00:06:50,544;Who killed him?
23;00:06:51,797;00:06:53,514;I did.
24;00:06:53,599;00:06:55,883;And Bowen Marsh
24;00:06:53,599;00:06:55,883;and Othell Yarwyck
25;00:06:55,968;00:06:58,268;and the other officers
25;00:06:55,968;00:06:58,268;in this castle.
26;00:06:58,387;00:07:00,054;Murderers!
26;00:06:58,387;00:07:00,054;Traitors!
27;00:07:03,893;00:07:06,110;You're right!
28;00:07:06,228;00:07:08,445;We've committed treason,
28;00:07:06,228;00:07:08,445;all of us.
29;00:07:08,564;00:07:11,649;Jon Snow was
29;00:07:08,564;00:07:11,649;my Lord Commander.
30;00:07:12,818;00:07:14,451;I had no love for him.
31;00:07:14,570;00:07:16,904;That was no secret.
32;00:07:17,039;00:07:21,241;But I never once
32;00:07:17,039;00:07:21,241;disobeyed an order.
33;00:07:21,327;00:07:23,744;Loyalty is the foundation
34;00:07:23,879;00:07:25,879;on which the Night's
34;00:07:23,879;00:07:25,879;Watch is built.
35;00:07:25,965;00:07:28,332;And the Watch means
35;00:07:25,965;00:07:28,332;everything to me.
36;00:07:28,417;00:07:30,384;I have given my life,
37;00:07:30,469;00:07:34,588;we have all given our lives
37;00:07:30,469;00:07:34,588;to the Night's Watch.
38;00:07:36,976;00:07:41,478;Jon Snow was going to destroy
38;00:07:36,976;00:07:41,478;the Night's Watch.
39;00:07:41,597;00:07:44,181;He let the wildlings
39;00:07:41,597;00:07:44,181;through our gates
40;00:07:44,266;00:07:47,735;as no Lord Commander
40;00:07:44,266;00:07:47,735;has ever done before.
41;00:07:47,820;00:07:52,606;He gave them the very land
41;00:07:47,820;00:07:52,606;on which they reaved
42;00:07:52,692;00:07:56,443;and raped and murdered.
43;00:07:56,579;00:08:00,781;Lord Commander Snow
43;00:07:56,579;00:08:00,781;did what he thought was right,
44;00:08:00,866;00:08:03,784;I've no doubt
44;00:08:00,866;00:08:03,784;about that.
45;00:08:03,919;00:08:08,088;And what he thought was right
45;00:08:03,919;00:08:08,088;would have been the end of us.
46;00:08:08,174;00:08:11,375;He thrust a terrible
46;00:08:08,174;00:08:11,375;choice upon us.
47;00:08:12,545;00:08:14,628;And we made it.
48;00:08:26,392;00:08:28,642;He'll have seen
48;00:08:26,392;00:08:28,642;we didn't come.
49;00:08:28,728;00:08:30,811;Thorne will have
49;00:08:28,728;00:08:30,811;made it official by now.
50;00:08:30,946;00:08:32,396;Castle Black is his.
51;00:08:32,481;00:08:35,649;I don't care who's sitting
51;00:08:32,481;00:08:35,649;at the high table.
52;00:08:35,735;00:08:37,317;Jon was my friend.
53;00:08:37,453;00:08:40,621;And those fuckers
53;00:08:37,453;00:08:40,621;butchered him.
54;00:08:40,706;00:08:43,157;Now we return the favor.
55;00:08:43,242;00:08:44,658;We don't have
55;00:08:43,242;00:08:44,658;the numbers.
56;00:08:44,794;00:08:46,710;We have a direwolf.
56;00:08:44,794;00:08:46,710;It's not enough.
57;00:08:46,829;00:08:48,829;I didn't know
57;00:08:46,829;00:08:48,829;Lord Commander Snow for long,
58;00:08:48,914;00:08:52,132;but I have to believe he wouldn't have
58;00:08:48,914;00:08:52,132;wanted his friends to die for nothing.
59;00:08:52,218;00:08:56,720;If you were planning to see tomorrow,
59;00:08:52,218;00:08:56,720;you picked the wrong room.
60;00:08:56,839;00:08:59,006;We all die today.
61;00:08:59,141;00:09:01,809;I say we do our best
61;00:08:59,141;00:09:01,809;to take Thorne with us when we go.
62;00:09:01,894;00:09:05,312;We need to fight,
62;00:09:01,894;00:09:05,312;but we don't need to die.
63;00:09:05,397;00:09:07,815;Not if we have help.
63;00:09:05,397;00:09:07,815;Who is gonna help us?
64;00:09:07,900;00:09:11,268;You're not the only ones
64;00:09:07,900;00:09:11,268;who owe your lives to Jon Snow.
65;00:09:19,495;00:09:21,195;Bolt the door.
66;00:09:21,280;00:09:23,197;Don't let anyone in.
67;00:09:23,282;00:09:25,365;I'll be back
67;00:09:23,282;00:09:25,365;as soon as I can.
68;00:09:35,377;00:09:38,629;She was 11 the first time
68;00:09:35,377;00:09:38,629;I saw her.
69;00:09:40,599;00:09:43,383;The kennelmaster's
69;00:09:40,599;00:09:43,383;daughter.
70;00:09:45,688;00:09:47,805;She smelled of dog.
71;00:09:50,943;00:09:54,728;I wasn't much older,
71;00:09:50,943;00:09:54,728;but everybody was already afraid of me.
72;00:09:56,365;00:09:58,398;You certainly were.
73;00:10:03,823;00:10:05,405;Myranda wasn't, though.
74;00:10:05,491;00:10:09,376;What could I do to her
74;00:10:05,491;00:10:09,376;that those hounds couldn't?
75;00:10:09,461;00:10:11,328;She was fearless.
76;00:10:11,413;00:10:14,081;There was nothing
76;00:10:11,413;00:10:14,081;she wouldn't do.
77;00:10:19,755;00:10:23,590;Your pain will be paid for
77;00:10:19,755;00:10:23,590;a thousand times over.
78;00:10:26,595;00:10:29,263;I wish you could
78;00:10:26,595;00:10:29,263;be here to watch.
79;00:10:33,769;00:10:37,187;Shall I have a grave
79;00:10:33,769;00:10:37,187;dug for her, my lord?
80;00:10:38,774;00:10:41,692;Or would you rather
80;00:10:38,774;00:10:41,692;the men build a pyre?
81;00:10:46,532;00:10:48,832;Buried, burned?
82;00:10:48,951;00:10:50,584;This is good meat.
83;00:10:50,669;00:10:52,119;Feed it to the hounds.
84;00:10:54,123;00:10:56,840;Your command of the cavalry
84;00:10:54,123;00:10:56,840;was impressive.
85;00:10:56,959;00:10:59,843;Thanks to you, the false king
85;00:10:56,959;00:10:59,843;Stannis Baratheon is dead.
86;00:10:59,962;00:11:02,596;Do you know who struck
86;00:10:59,962;00:11:02,596;the killing blow?
87;00:11:02,681;00:11:04,681;No.
87;00:11:02,681;00:11:04,681;A shame.
88;00:11:04,800;00:11:06,683;I'd reward the man.
89;00:11:06,802;00:11:10,103;Still,
89;00:11:06,802;00:11:10,103;a great victory.
90;00:11:10,189;00:11:12,222;Do you feel
90;00:11:10,189;00:11:12,222;like a victor?
91;00:11:17,313;00:11:19,196;I rebelled
91;00:11:17,313;00:11:19,196;against the crown
92;00:11:19,315;00:11:21,365;to arrange your marriage
92;00:11:19,315;00:11:21,365;to Sansa Stark.
93;00:11:21,483;00:11:23,984;Do you think that
93;00:11:21,483;00:11:23,984;burning wagons in the night
94;00:11:24,119;00:11:26,320;and mowing down tired,
94;00:11:24,119;00:11:26,320;outnumbered Baratheons
95;00:11:26,455;00:11:29,740;is the same as facing a prepared
95;00:11:26,455;00:11:29,740;Nd provisioned Lannister army?
96;00:11:32,912;00:11:34,244;No.
97;00:11:36,131;00:11:37,831;A reckoning will come.
98;00:11:37,967;00:11:39,549;We need the North
98;00:11:37,967;00:11:39,549;to face it.
99;00:11:39,668;00:11:41,501;The entire North.
100;00:11:41,637;00:11:44,838;They won't back us
100;00:11:41,637;00:11:44,838;without Sansa Stark.
101;00:11:46,175;00:11:48,592;We no longer have
101;00:11:46,175;00:11:48,592;Sansa Stark.
102;00:11:48,677;00:11:50,894;You played
102;00:11:48,677;00:11:50,894;your games with her.
103;00:11:51,013;00:11:53,326;You played your games with
103;00:11:51,013;00:11:53,326;the heir to the Iron Islands
104;00:11:53,350;00:11:54,599;and now they're both gone.
105;00:11:54,600;00:11:57,517;I have a team of men after them
105;00:11:54,600;00:11:57,517;with some of my best hounds.
106;00:11:57,603;00:11:59,152;They won't get far.
107;00:11:59,238;00:12:01,238;I'm glad to hear it.
108;00:12:01,357;00:12:04,658;Without Sansa, you won't be able
108;00:12:01,357;00:12:04,658;to produce an heir.
109;00:12:04,743;00:12:07,828;And without an heir,
109;00:12:04,743;00:12:07,828;well...
110;00:12:10,749;00:12:13,000;let's hope
110;00:12:10,749;00:12:13,000;the maesters are right
111;00:12:13,085;00:12:15,002;and Lady Walda's
111;00:12:13,085;00:12:15,002;carrying a boy.
112;00:12:35,391;00:12:37,357;We can't stop.
113;00:12:56,078;00:12:57,577;We have to cross here.
114;00:13:00,582;00:13:01,797;I can't.
115;00:13:01,798;00:13:03,248;It's the only way
115;00:13:01,798;00:13:03,248;to throw off the hounds.
116;00:13:03,252;00:13:05,802;But it's too cold. I can't.
116;00:13:03,252;00:13:05,802;I won't make it. I'll die.
117;00:13:05,921;00:13:08,422;I've seen what his hounds
117;00:13:05,921;00:13:08,422;do to a person.
118;00:13:08,507;00:13:10,507;This way is better.
119;00:13:42,708;00:13:45,125;Over here.
119;00:13:42,708;00:13:45,125;Come on.
120;00:14:00,526;00:14:01,892;Sansa.
121;00:14:03,278;00:14:04,945;Sansa.
122;00:14:25,334;00:14:28,135;Tell them to settle down!
123;00:14:28,220;00:14:29,469;Stay here.
123;00:14:28,220;00:14:29,469;I'll lure them away.
124;00:14:29,555;00:14:31,671;No, I won't make it
124;00:14:29,555;00:14:31,671;without you.
125;00:14:31,807;00:14:33,507;You will.
126;00:14:33,592;00:14:35,842;Go north, only north.
127;00:14:35,928;00:14:37,761;Jon is Lord Commander
127;00:14:35,928;00:14:37,761;at Castle Black.
128;00:14:37,846;00:14:39,513;He'll help you.
129;00:14:48,774;00:14:51,241;See somebody, eh?
130;00:14:51,360;00:14:53,860;There they are!
130;00:14:51,360;00:14:53,860;Get them!
131;00:14:58,033;00:14:59,866;Where is Lady Bolton?
132;00:15:01,203;00:15:02,869;Dead.
132;00:15:01,203;00:15:02,869;Liar.
133;00:15:03,005;00:15:06,206;She broke her leg
133;00:15:03,005;00:15:06,206;jumping from the ramparts.
134;00:15:06,291;00:15:08,375;I left her to die
134;00:15:06,291;00:15:08,375;in the snow.
135;00:15:13,382;00:15:15,348;Got something!
135;00:15:13,382;00:15:15,348;Run!
136;00:15:17,853;00:15:18,969;Hyah!
137;00:15:27,312;00:15:29,813;Resist. Stay.
138;00:15:31,900;00:15:33,900;Stay.
139;00:15:34,036;00:15:38,238;I can't wait to see what parts
139;00:15:34,036;00:15:38,238;Ramsay cuts off you this time.
140;00:15:46,965;00:15:48,915;Rider! Who is it?
141;00:15:49,001;00:15:51,551;It's a bloody woman.
142;00:16:58,820;00:17:01,154;No! Please!
143;00:17:53,842;00:17:57,294;Lady Sansa, I offer
143;00:17:53,842;00:17:57,294;my services once again.
144;00:17:58,880;00:18:01,047;I will shield your back
144;00:17:58,880;00:18:01,047;and keep your counsel
145;00:18:01,133;00:18:03,383;and give my life
145;00:18:01,133;00:18:03,383;for yours if need be.
146;00:18:04,886;00:18:07,053;I swear it by the old gods
146;00:18:04,886;00:18:07,053;and the new.
147;00:18:17,065;00:18:18,865;And I vow...
148;00:18:20,652;00:18:24,070;that you shall always
148;00:18:20,652;00:18:24,070;have a place by my hearth
149;00:18:24,206;00:18:26,039;and...
150;00:18:28,243;00:18:29,993;Meat and mead
150;00:18:28,243;00:18:29,993;at my table.
151;00:18:30,078;00:18:32,245;...meat and mead
151;00:18:30,078;00:18:32,245;at my table.
152;00:18:34,883;00:18:39,336;And I pledge to ask
152;00:18:34,883;00:18:39,336;no service of you
153;00:18:39,421;00:18:41,921;that might
153;00:18:39,421;00:18:41,921;bring you dishonor.
154;00:18:42,007;00:18:45,258;I swear it by the old gods
154;00:18:42,007;00:18:45,258;and the new.
155;00:18:46,645;00:18:48,345;Arise.
156;00:19:33,475;00:19:36,943;Your Grace, I'm sorry
156;00:19:33,475;00:19:36,943;to disturb you.
157;00:19:37,028;00:19:39,612;A ship from Dorne
157;00:19:37,028;00:19:39,612;has sailed into the harbor.
158;00:19:40,949;00:19:42,732;Myrcella.
159;00:20:55,640;00:20:58,725;Do you remember
159;00:20:55,640;00:20:58,725;the first time you saw a dead body?
160;00:21:00,145;00:21:01,728;Mother.
161;00:21:04,032;00:21:05,732;All I could think about
161;00:21:04,032;00:21:05,732;when she died
162;00:21:05,867;00:21:08,034;was what would happen
162;00:21:05,867;00:21:08,034;to her now.
163;00:21:11,656;00:21:14,657;Every day,
163;00:21:11,656;00:21:14,657;every night,
164;00:21:14,743;00:21:17,076;what does Mama
164;00:21:14,743;00:21:17,076;look like now?
165;00:21:19,464;00:21:21,714;Has she started
165;00:21:19,464;00:21:21,714;to bloat?
166;00:21:23,251;00:21:25,752;Has her skin
166;00:21:23,251;00:21:25,752;turned black?
167;00:21:27,255;00:21:29,923;Have her lips
167;00:21:27,255;00:21:29,923;peeled back from her teeth?
168;00:21:34,896;00:21:37,764;I think about locking
168;00:21:34,896;00:21:37,764;Myrcella in a crypt.
169;00:21:39,601;00:21:42,151;I think about her beautiful little face
169;00:21:39,601;00:21:42,151;starting to collapse.
170;00:21:42,270;00:21:45,438;Shh, shh.
170;00:21:42,270;00:21:45,438;Don't think about it.
171;00:21:45,524;00:21:47,240;I have to.
172;00:21:49,277;00:21:51,411;I have to. It's not right she has
172;00:21:49,277;00:21:51,411;to suffer alone.
173;00:21:51,496;00:21:54,747;She's not suffering.
173;00:21:51,496;00:21:54,747;She's gone.
174;00:21:54,833;00:21:57,700;No one can
174;00:21:54,833;00:21:57,700;hurt her anymore.
175;00:21:59,287;00:22:01,087;She was good.
176;00:22:02,424;00:22:05,375;From her first breath,
176;00:22:02,424;00:22:05,375;she was so sweet.
177;00:22:07,128;00:22:09,128;I don't know where
177;00:22:07,128;00:22:09,128;she came from.
178;00:22:11,132;00:22:14,133;She was nothing like me.
179;00:22:14,219;00:22:16,686;No meanness,
179;00:22:14,219;00:22:16,686;no jealousy, just good.
180;00:22:16,805;00:22:18,471;I know.
181;00:22:18,557;00:22:22,809;I thought if I could
181;00:22:18,557;00:22:22,809;make something so good,
182;00:22:22,894;00:22:25,478;so pure...
183;00:22:27,816;00:22:30,817;maybe I'm not a monster.
183;00:22:27,816;00:22:30,817;Listen-- listen to me.
184;00:22:30,902;00:22:33,453;She was my daughter
184;00:22:30,902;00:22:33,453;and I failed her.
185;00:22:33,538;00:22:36,039;No, I knew
185;00:22:33,538;00:22:36,039;this would happen.
186;00:22:36,157;00:22:38,291;The witch told me
186;00:22:36,157;00:22:38,291;years ago.
187;00:22:40,211;00:22:43,329;She promised me three children
187;00:22:40,211;00:22:43,329;and she promised me they'd die.
188;00:22:43,415;00:22:45,999;And gold their shrouds.
189;00:22:46,134;00:22:47,667;Everything she said
189;00:22:46,134;00:22:47,667;came true.
190;00:22:47,752;00:22:49,502;You couldn't
190;00:22:47,752;00:22:49,502;have stopped it.
191;00:22:49,638;00:22:51,254;It's prophecy.
191;00:22:49,638;00:22:51,254;It's fate.
192;00:22:51,339;00:22:54,340;You don't believe that.
192;00:22:51,339;00:22:54,340;Of course I do.
193;00:22:54,426;00:22:57,594;You told me yourself
193;00:22:54,426;00:22:57,594;when Father died.
194;00:22:57,679;00:22:59,562;You said we had
194;00:22:57,679;00:22:59,562;to stay together.
195;00:22:59,681;00:23:02,899;You said people would try
195;00:22:59,681;00:23:02,899;to tear us apart, take what's ours.
196;00:23:03,018;00:23:04,517;That was a prophecy, too.
197;00:23:04,653;00:23:06,903;I didn't listen to you
197;00:23:04,653;00:23:06,903;and everything you said came true.
198;00:23:07,022;00:23:09,439;Fuck prophecy.
198;00:23:07,022;00:23:09,439;Fuck fate.
199;00:23:09,524;00:23:11,908;Fuck everyone
199;00:23:09,524;00:23:11,908;who isn't us.
200;00:23:12,027;00:23:13,526;We're the only ones
200;00:23:12,027;00:23:13,526;who matter,
201;00:23:13,662;00:23:15,745;the only ones
201;00:23:13,662;00:23:15,745;in this world.
202;00:23:15,864;00:23:17,304;And everything
202;00:23:15,864;00:23:17,304;they've taken from us,
203;00:23:17,332;00:23:19,449;we're going
203;00:23:17,332;00:23:19,449;to take back and more.
204;00:23:22,037;00:23:24,704;We're going to take
204;00:23:22,037;00:23:24,704;everything there is.
205;00:23:31,846;00:23:35,682;The Seven Hells brim
205;00:23:31,846;00:23:35,682;with the souls of saintly men.
206;00:23:35,767;00:23:38,601;They scream in agony
206;00:23:35,767;00:23:38,601;and their shame is so great,
207;00:23:38,720;00:23:40,687;they do not feel
207;00:23:38,720;00:23:40,687;the flames,
208;00:23:40,772;00:23:43,690;for now they see
208;00:23:40,772;00:23:43,690;if not for a single sin
209;00:23:43,775;00:23:46,526;they concealed,
209;00:23:43,775;00:23:46,526;they were saved.
210;00:23:46,611;00:23:48,528;I'd like to see
210;00:23:46,611;00:23:48,528;my brother.
211;00:23:48,613;00:23:50,897;Confess.
211;00:23:48,613;00:23:50,897;Please.
212;00:23:50,982;00:23:52,982;How is he?
212;00:23:50,982;00:23:52,982;At least tell me that.
213;00:23:53,068;00:23:54,400;Confess.
214;00:23:58,073;00:24:00,573;I am the queen
214;00:23:58,073;00:24:00,573;and I demand to see my brother.
215;00:24:00,659;00:24:02,659;Sinners
215;00:24:00,659;00:24:02,659;don't make demands.
216;00:24:02,744;00:24:05,461;They make confessions.
217;00:24:08,249;00:24:11,217;Septa Unella.
218;00:24:11,302;00:24:14,170;Our other guests need you.
219;00:24:25,350;00:24:27,433;There.
220;00:24:29,020;00:24:32,271;Septa Unella can be
220;00:24:29,020;00:24:32,271;overzealous at times.
221;00:24:32,407;00:24:33,773;I'll speak with her.
222;00:24:35,410;00:24:38,578;My brother,
222;00:24:35,410;00:24:38,578;can you tell me how he is?
223;00:24:40,331;00:24:44,283;It isn't Ser Loras
223;00:24:40,331;00:24:44,283;that brings me here.
224;00:24:45,620;00:24:47,453;Your husband
224;00:24:45,620;00:24:47,453;misses you dearly.
225;00:24:47,589;00:24:51,591;The love between a man
225;00:24:47,589;00:24:51,591;and wife is sacred.
226;00:24:51,676;00:24:54,844;It reflects the love
226;00:24:51,676;00:24:54,844;the gods have for all of us.
227;00:24:54,963;00:24:59,432;But sin leads us away
227;00:24:54,963;00:24:59,432;from the sacred.
228;00:24:59,517;00:25:02,351;And only confession
228;00:24:59,517;00:25:02,351;can purge sin.
229;00:25:02,470;00:25:05,138;I have nothing
229;00:25:02,470;00:25:05,138;to confess.
230;00:25:05,273;00:25:09,859;So you believe
230;00:25:05,273;00:25:09,859;you are pure?
231;00:25:09,978;00:25:11,811;Perfect?
232;00:25:11,896;00:25:14,280;Wholly without sin?
233;00:25:15,617;00:25:16,983;None of us are.
234;00:25:18,987;00:25:21,738;You have started
234;00:25:18,987;00:25:21,738;down the path.
235;00:25:23,241;00:25:25,324;But you have
235;00:25:23,241;00:25:25,324;many miles to go.
236;00:25:39,340;00:25:41,924;I always envied Oberyn.
237;00:25:42,010;00:25:43,726;He lived.
238;00:25:43,845;00:25:45,428;He truly lived.
239;00:25:45,513;00:25:47,346;Sailed around the world.
240;00:25:47,482;00:25:49,348;Fought men
240;00:25:47,482;00:25:49,348;from every country.
241;00:25:49,484;00:25:51,851;Lay with the most
241;00:25:49,484;00:25:51,851;beautiful women alive.
242;00:25:51,986;00:25:54,020;And men.
242;00:25:51,986;00:25:54,020;And men.
243;00:25:54,105;00:25:56,689;He experienced
243;00:25:54,105;00:25:56,689;everything
244;00:25:56,825;00:25:59,692;while I sat here
244;00:25:56,825;00:25:59,692;in Dorne
245;00:25:59,778;00:26:04,697;trying my best to keep my people
245;00:25:59,778;00:26:04,697;alive and well fed.
246;00:26:04,833;00:26:06,532;But that is life.
247;00:26:08,119;00:26:10,253;We each have our roles.
248;00:26:10,371;00:26:15,124;Oberyn was born
248;00:26:10,371;00:26:15,124;to be an adventurer.
249;00:26:15,210;00:26:17,093;And I was born to rule.
250;00:26:17,212;00:26:18,961;The gods
250;00:26:17,212;00:26:18,961;are not fools.
251;00:26:19,047;00:26:21,931;You would have been
251;00:26:19,047;00:26:21,931;a lousy adventurer.
252;00:26:22,050;00:26:24,517;And Oberyn, pfft,
253;00:26:24,602;00:26:26,302;he would have been
253;00:26:24,602;00:26:26,302;a terrible ruler.
254;00:26:26,387;00:26:29,772;Your mother is a brilliant woman,
254;00:26:26,387;00:26:29,772;you know that?
255;00:26:29,891;00:26:32,191;Prince Doran.
256;00:26:44,072;00:26:46,038;The Princess Myrcella.
257;00:27:04,759;00:27:07,176;When was the last time
257;00:27:04,759;00:27:07,176;you left this palace?
258;00:27:07,262;00:27:09,595;You don't know
258;00:27:07,262;00:27:09,595;your own people.
259;00:27:09,731;00:27:12,932;Their disgust for you.
260;00:27:13,067;00:27:16,936;Elia Martell raped and murdered,
260;00:27:13,067;00:27:16,936;and you did nothing.
261;00:27:17,021;00:27:21,607;Oberyn Martell butchered,
261;00:27:17,021;00:27:21,607;and you did nothing.
262;00:27:22,944;00:27:25,411;You're not a Dornishman.
263;00:27:26,865;00:27:28,748;You're not our prince.
264;00:27:28,833;00:27:33,119;My son Trystane...
265;00:27:34,923;00:27:38,190;Your son is weak
265;00:27:34,923;00:27:38,190;just like you.
266;00:27:38,276;00:27:42,361;And weak men will never
266;00:27:38,276;00:27:42,361;rule Dorne again.
267;00:28:05,136;00:28:07,637;I told you
267;00:28:05,136;00:28:07,637;I'm not hungry.
268;00:28:07,755;00:28:09,889;We're not here
268;00:28:07,755;00:28:09,889;to feed you.
269;00:28:12,010;00:28:14,093;We're here to kill you.
270;00:28:14,228;00:28:16,896;You want her
270;00:28:14,228;00:28:16,896;to do it or me?
271;00:28:16,981;00:28:20,600;We are family.
271;00:28:16,981;00:28:20,600;I don't want to hurt you.
272;00:28:20,735;00:28:23,436;Her or me?
273;00:28:27,942;00:28:29,025;You.
274;00:28:29,110;00:28:30,993;Good.
275;00:28:31,112;00:28:33,446;Smart boy.
276;00:28:50,131;00:28:52,632;You're a greedy bitch,
276;00:28:50,131;00:28:52,632;you know that?
277;00:29:00,108;00:29:03,109;We're never going to fix
277;00:29:00,108;00:29:03,109;what's wrong with this city
278;00:29:03,194;00:29:05,728;from the top
278;00:29:03,194;00:29:05,728;of an 800-foot pyramid.
279;00:29:05,813;00:29:08,230;We'll be fine.
280;00:29:08,316;00:29:10,816;We're dressed like
280;00:29:08,316;00:29:10,816;common merchants.
281;00:29:12,403;00:29:14,737;You walk
281;00:29:12,403;00:29:14,737;like a rich person.
282;00:29:14,822;00:29:17,790;You've spent a lot of time studying
282;00:29:14,822;00:29:17,790;the way rich people walk?
283;00:29:17,875;00:29:21,877;You walk as though the paving stones
283;00:29:17,875;00:29:21,877;were your personal property.
284;00:29:21,996;00:29:25,164;I used to steal from people
284;00:29:21,996;00:29:25,164;like you when I was a boy.
285;00:29:25,249;00:29:27,299;It's a good thing
285;00:29:25,249;00:29:27,299;you're not a boy anymore.
286;00:29:28,970;00:29:31,003;Because you
286;00:29:28,970;00:29:31,003;have no cock.
287;00:29:49,607;00:29:51,857;She thinks you want
287;00:29:49,607;00:29:51,857;to eat her baby.
288;00:30:14,716;00:30:18,217;Mhysa means mother in Valyrian.
288;00:30:14,716;00:30:18,217;- I know what mhysa means.
289;00:30:18,302;00:30:20,186;Who wrote it?
289;00:30:18,302;00:30:20,186;Hard to know.
290;00:30:20,271;00:30:23,806;Our queen is not as popular in Meereen
290;00:30:20,271;00:30:23,806;as she used to be.
291;00:30:23,891;00:30:25,641;The Sons of the Harpy?
292;00:30:25,727;00:30:27,309;Very possibly.
293;00:30:29,147;00:30:32,114;Daenerys Targaryen took away
293;00:30:29,147;00:30:32,114;their most valuable property,
294;00:30:32,233;00:30:36,152;told them human beings
294;00:30:32,233;00:30:36,152;weren't even property to begin with.
295;00:30:36,237;00:30:38,404;You can see why
295;00:30:36,237;00:30:38,404;they're unhappy.
296;00:30:38,539;00:30:40,790;Of course,
297;00:30:40,908;00:30:43,576;it could also
297;00:30:40,908;00:30:43,576;be the freed men.
298;00:30:54,889;00:30:58,474;Many of the former slaves feel
298;00:30:54,889;00:30:58,474;that Daenerys has abandoned them.
299;00:30:58,593;00:31:01,927;She did fly away on a dragon
299;00:30:58,593;00:31:01,927;and not come back.
300;00:31:19,363;00:31:21,781;It's a problem.
301;00:31:23,751;00:31:26,452;Fear has brought Meereen
301;00:31:23,751;00:31:26,452;to a standstill.
302;00:31:28,456;00:31:30,673;Whoever you are,
302;00:31:28,456;00:31:30,673;wherever you go,
303;00:31:30,792;00:31:33,959;someone in this city
303;00:31:30,792;00:31:33,959;wants to murder you.
304;00:31:34,045;00:31:37,046;We can't fight
304;00:31:34,045;00:31:37,046;an enemy we don't know.
305;00:31:37,131;00:31:40,015;The Sons of the Harpy
305;00:31:37,131;00:31:40,015;planned their attack
306;00:31:40,134;00:31:41,967;in the fighting pits
306;00:31:40,134;00:31:41,967;very carefully,
307;00:31:42,053;00:31:44,720;which means they take
307;00:31:42,053;00:31:44,720;orders from someone.
308;00:31:44,806;00:31:46,939;And have you started
308;00:31:44,806;00:31:46,939;looking for that someone?
309;00:31:47,024;00:31:49,809;My little birds
309;00:31:47,024;00:31:49,809;have already taken wing.
310;00:31:49,944;00:31:54,396;Soon they'll return,
310;00:31:49,944;00:31:54,396;singing songs of men in gold masks.
311;00:32:28,482;00:32:33,269;Well, we won't be sailing
311;00:32:28,482;00:32:33,269;to Westeros anytime soon.
312;00:32:55,209;00:32:57,092;Goat?
313;00:32:57,211;00:32:58,794;Ram.
314;00:32:58,880;00:33:00,546;You think
314;00:32:58,880;00:33:00,546;our friend got him?
315;00:33:02,183;00:33:04,967;Don't know anything else
315;00:33:02,183;00:33:04,967;that can melt a ram's horn.
316;00:33:07,021;00:33:09,221;We're on the right
316;00:33:07,021;00:33:09,221;path, then.
317;00:33:09,357;00:33:12,441;Perhaps she's tired
317;00:33:09,357;00:33:12,441;of being queen.
318;00:33:12,560;00:33:14,610;I don't think
318;00:33:12,560;00:33:14,610;she likes it very much.
319;00:33:14,729;00:33:16,896;She's too smart
319;00:33:14,729;00:33:16,896;to like it.
320;00:33:17,031;00:33:18,814;Maybe she's flown
320;00:33:17,031;00:33:18,814;somewhere else,
321;00:33:18,900;00:33:20,900;somewhere far away
321;00:33:18,900;00:33:20,900;from men like us.
322;00:33:20,985;00:33:23,819;I've been
322;00:33:20,985;00:33:23,819;all over the world.
323;00:33:23,905;00:33:25,821;There's no escaping
323;00:33:23,905;00:33:25,821;men like us.
324;00:33:25,907;00:33:28,624;There's no escaping
324;00:33:25,907;00:33:28,624;her, eh?
325;00:33:28,743;00:33:31,911;You keep coming back.
325;00:33:28,743;00:33:31,911;Why?
326;00:33:31,996;00:33:33,495;You know why.
327;00:33:35,549;00:33:37,583;Isn't it frustrating
328;00:33:37,718;00:33:41,086;wanting someone
328;00:33:37,718;00:33:41,086;who doesn't want you back?
329;00:33:41,222;00:33:42,638;Of course it is.
330;00:33:42,757;00:33:45,307;You're a romantic.
330;00:33:42,757;00:33:45,307;I admire that.
331;00:33:45,426;00:33:47,393;Sometimes I look at you
331;00:33:45,426;00:33:47,393;and I think,
332;00:33:47,478;00:33:49,812;So that's what I'll be like
332;00:33:47,478;00:33:49,812;when I grow old.
333;00:33:49,931;00:33:51,597;If you grow old.
334;00:33:51,682;00:33:52,932;If I grow old.
335;00:33:53,067;00:33:55,234;I hope I do.
336;00:33:55,319;00:33:57,069;I want to see what
336;00:33:55,319;00:33:57,069;the world looks like
337;00:33:57,154;00:33:58,771;when she's done
337;00:33:57,154;00:33:58,771;conquering it.
338;00:33:58,906;00:34:00,906;So do I.
339;00:34:20,594;00:34:23,379;Huh, an army?
340;00:34:23,464;00:34:24,880;Not an army.
341;00:34:24,966;00:34:26,715;A horde.
342;00:34:52,376;00:34:53,575;Dothraki?
343;00:35:16,934;00:35:18,684;They have her.
344;00:37:24,311;00:37:25,944;No.
345;00:41:50,411;00:41:52,744;But there has to be a price
345;00:41:50,411;00:41:52,744;to pay for everything.
346;00:41:52,830;00:41:56,448;I know, but have you tried
346;00:41:52,830;00:41:56,448;telling him that?
347;00:42:03,807;00:42:06,341;Thank you.
348;00:42:06,427;00:42:08,977;Who'd go there after what
348;00:42:06,427;00:42:08,977;happened to that Kingsguard?
349;00:42:09,096;00:42:10,762;- Probably had it coming.
349;00:42:09,096;00:42:10,762;- Maybe so,
350;00:42:10,898;00:42:12,481;but I'm not risking it.
351;00:42:12,599;00:42:14,182;- Just can't do it.
351;00:42:12,599;00:42:14,182;- All right.
352;00:42:14,268;00:42:16,685;Honesty as well.
352;00:42:14,268;00:42:16,685;He gets it.
353;00:42:21,241;00:42:23,275;Are you listening,
353;00:42:21,241;00:42:23,275;blind girl?
354;00:42:24,995;00:42:27,612;Do you hear them talking?
355;00:42:27,698;00:42:30,415;Do any of them
355;00:42:27,698;00:42:30,415;talk to you?
356;00:42:30,501;00:42:31,917;No.
357;00:42:33,036;00:42:34,870;So sad.
358;00:42:41,295;00:42:44,045;Stand and fight, blind girl.
359;00:42:45,799;00:42:47,265;I can't see.
360;00:42:47,351;00:42:49,468;That's your problem,
360;00:42:47,351;00:42:49,468;not mine.
361;00:43:17,581;00:43:19,164;See you tomorrow.
362;00:44:11,218;00:44:15,103;Ser Davos, we have
362;00:44:11,218;00:44:15,103;no cause to fight.
363;00:44:15,222;00:44:17,355;We are both
363;00:44:15,222;00:44:17,355;anointed knights.
364;00:44:17,441;00:44:21,026;Hear that, lads?
364;00:44:17,441;00:44:21,026;Nothing to fear.
365;00:44:21,111;00:44:23,278;I will grant amnesty
365;00:44:21,111;00:44:23,278;to all brothers
366;00:44:23,397;00:44:25,730;who throw down their arms
366;00:44:23,397;00:44:25,730;before nightfall.
367;00:44:25,816;00:44:29,451;And you, Ser Davos,
367;00:44:25,816;00:44:29,451;I will allow you to travel south
368;00:44:29,570;00:44:32,404;a free man
368;00:44:29,570;00:44:32,404;with a fresh horse.
369;00:44:33,907;00:44:36,124;And some mutton.
370;00:44:36,243;00:44:37,792;I'd like some mutton.
371;00:44:37,911;00:44:41,713;What?
371;00:44:37,911;00:44:41,713;I'm not much of a hunter.
372;00:44:41,798;00:44:45,417;I'll need some food if I'm gonna make it
372;00:44:41,798;00:44:45,417;south without starving.
373;00:44:49,723;00:44:51,423;We'll give you food.
374;00:44:51,558;00:44:54,726;You can bring the Red Woman
374;00:44:51,558;00:44:54,726;with you if you like.
375;00:44:54,811;00:44:58,263;Or you can leave her here with us,
375;00:44:54,811;00:44:58,263;whichever you choose.
376;00:44:58,348;00:45:03,184;But surrender by nightfall
376;00:44:58,348;00:45:03,184;or this ends with blood.
377;00:45:04,738;00:45:06,655;Thank you, Ser Alliser.
378;00:45:06,773;00:45:10,909;We'll discuss amongst ourselves
378;00:45:06,773;00:45:10,909;and come back to you with an answer.
379;00:45:25,509;00:45:30,211;Boys, I've been running
379;00:45:25,509;00:45:30,211;from men like that all my life.
380;00:45:30,297;00:45:33,465;In my learned opinion,
