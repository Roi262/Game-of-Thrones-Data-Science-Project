1;00:02:09,790;00:02:12,456;We shouldn't be out here alone.
﻿1;00:02:09,790;00:02:12,456;Why not?
2;00:02:12,457;00:02:15,164;If your father...
2;00:02:12,457;00:02:15,164;He'll never know we're gone.
3;00:02:15,165;00:02:17,232;But if he finds out...
4;00:02:21,124;00:02:23,749;You don't need
4;00:02:21,124;00:02:23,749;to be afraid of my father.
5;00:02:50,874;00:02:53,289;Are you sure?
6;00:02:53,290;00:02:55,081;Yes.
7;00:02:55,082;00:02:58,290;We shouldn't go in.
7;00:02:55,082;00:02:58,290;Of course we should.
8;00:03:42,499;00:03:45,748;Get out.
8;00:03:42,499;00:03:45,748;Get out!
9;00:03:45,749;00:03:47,706;Let's go.
9;00:03:45,749;00:03:47,706;No.
10;00:03:47,707;00:03:49,482;Listen to your friend.
11;00:03:50,832;00:03:52,539;They said that you
11;00:03:50,832;00:03:52,539;were terrifying
12;00:03:52,540;00:03:56,623;with cat's teeth and three eyes.
13;00:03:56,624;00:03:58,499;You're not terrifying.
14;00:03:59,165;00:04:01,998;You're boring.
15;00:04:01,999;00:04:04,100;You don't know what I am.
16;00:04:04,220;00:04:07,618;I know you're a witch
16;00:04:04,220;00:04:07,618;and you can see the future.
17;00:04:08,999;00:04:10,914;Tell me mine.
18;00:04:10,915;00:04:13,206;Everyone wants
18;00:04:10,915;00:04:13,206;to know their future
19;00:04:13,207;00:04:15,331;until they know their future.
20;00:04:15,332;00:04:18,706;This is my father's land.
20;00:04:15,332;00:04:18,706;My land.
21;00:04:18,707;00:04:23,751;Tell me my future or I'll have your two
21;00:04:18,707;00:04:23,751;boring eyes gouged out of your head.
22;00:04:33,389;00:04:35,998;Your blood.
23;00:04:35,999;00:04:37,540;Give me a taste.
24;00:05:02,874;00:05:04,821;Three questions you get.
25;00:05:05,382;00:05:07,832;You won't like the answers.
26;00:05:11,499;00:05:14,206;I've been promised
26;00:05:11,499;00:05:14,206;to the prince.
27;00:05:14,207;00:05:17,331;When will we marry?
28;00:05:17,332;00:05:19,007;You will never wed the prince.
29;00:05:19,244;00:05:20,998;You will wed the king.
30;00:05:20,999;00:05:22,456;But I will be queen?
31;00:05:22,457;00:05:24,873;Oh, yes.
32;00:05:24,874;00:05:27,206;You'll be queen.
33;00:05:27,207;00:05:29,081;For a time.
34;00:05:29,082;00:05:32,164;Then comes another,
35;00:05:32,165;00:05:33,664;younger,
36;00:05:33,665;00:05:36,289;more beautiful,
37;00:05:36,290;00:05:39,581;to cast you down
37;00:05:36,290;00:05:39,581;and take all you hold dear.
38;00:05:39,582;00:05:42,789;W-will the king and I
38;00:05:39,582;00:05:42,789;have children?
39;00:05:42,790;00:05:48,185;No. The king will have 20
39;00:05:42,790;00:05:48,185;children and you will have three.
40;00:05:48,305;00:05:49,289;That doesn't make sense.
41;00:05:49,290;00:05:52,748;Gold will be their crowns.
42;00:05:52,749;00:05:55,624;Gold their shrouds.
43;00:06:02,915;00:06:04,456;Come on, we have to go.
44;00:06:05,249;00:06:07,914;We have to go!
44;00:06:05,249;00:06:07,914;Cersei!
45;00:06:11,874;00:06:13,873;Bearers, put it down.
46;00:06:29,207;00:06:32,581;Bearers, up.
47;00:06:32,582;00:06:34,332;Away.
48;00:06:47,999;00:06:50,748;Your Grace, we are
48;00:06:47,999;00:06:50,748;honored by your presence.
49;00:06:50,749;00:06:52,164;The mourners are waiting.
50;00:06:52,284;00:06:54,679;They will keep waiting.
51;00:06:54,783;00:06:56,532;I want a moment alone with him.
52;00:06:56,533;00:06:58,991;But, Your Grace, many of these lords
52;00:06:56,533;00:06:58,991;and ladies have travelled
53;00:06:58,992;00:07:01,157;day and night to be here from
53;00:06:58,992;00:07:01,157;all seven kingdoms.
54;00:07:01,158;00:07:02,908;They will wait.
55;00:07:30,158;00:07:32,282;He never wanted you
55;00:07:30,158;00:07:32,282;to be a Kingsguard,
56;00:07:32,283;00:07:36,033;but here you are,
56;00:07:32,283;00:07:36,033;protecting his dead body.
57;00:07:37,867;00:07:41,783;What he built, it's ours.
58;00:07:42,992;00:07:45,908;He built it for us.
58;00:07:42,992;00:07:45,908;He meant it for us.
59;00:07:48,158;00:07:49,657;They're going to try
59;00:07:48,158;00:07:49,657;to take it away.
60;00:07:49,658;00:07:51,032;All of it.
60;00:07:49,658;00:07:51,032;They?
61;00:07:51,033;00:07:52,741;All of them out there,
61;00:07:51,033;00:07:52,741;our enemies.
62;00:07:52,742;00:07:55,532;They're waiting in line to make sure
62;00:07:52,742;00:07:55,532;he's really dead.
63;00:07:55,533;00:07:58,324;And as soon as they see
63;00:07:55,533;00:07:58,324;the stones on his eyes,
64;00:07:58,325;00:08:00,157;they'll set to work
64;00:07:58,325;00:08:00,157;on tearing us apart.
65;00:08:00,158;00:08:02,907;They have nothing to do with it.
66;00:08:02,908;00:08:05,199;The man who murdered our father,
66;00:08:02,908;00:08:05,199;he tore us apart.
67;00:08:05,200;00:08:07,532;He's the enemy.
67;00:08:05,200;00:08:07,532;I've been telling you for years.
68;00:08:07,533;00:08:08,574;You've been defending
68;00:08:07,533;00:08:08,574;him for years.
69;00:08:08,575;00:08:10,741;This is exactly what they want.
70;00:08:10,742;00:08:12,366;And now our father is dead
71;00:08:12,367;00:08:15,825;and that little monster
71;00:08:12,367;00:08:15,825;is out there somewhere drawing breath.
72;00:08:17,950;00:08:20,117;Did you set him free?
73;00:08:22,742;00:08:24,449;Tyrion may be a monster,
74;00:08:24,450;00:08:28,449;but at least he killed
74;00:08:24,450;00:08:28,449;our father on purpose.
75;00:08:28,450;00:08:30,574;You killed him by mistake.
76;00:08:30,575;00:08:32,367;With stupidity.
77;00:08:33,867;00:08:35,282;You're a man
77;00:08:33,867;00:08:35,282;of action, aren't you?
78;00:08:35,283;00:08:37,824;When it occurs to you
78;00:08:35,283;00:08:37,824;to do something, you do it.
79;00:08:37,825;00:08:40,825;Never mind the consequences.
80;00:08:42,783;00:08:45,491;Take a look.
81;00:08:45,492;00:08:46,492;Look at the consequences.
82;00:08:49,492;00:08:51,325;Here they are.
83;00:08:55,200;00:08:58,492;He loved you more than
83;00:08:55,200;00:08:58,492;anyone in this world.
84;00:10:30,942;00:10:32,775;Apologies.
85;00:10:42,775;00:10:46,149;I still don't see
85;00:10:42,775;00:10:46,149;why I had to stay
86;00:10:46,150;00:10:48,232;in this fucking crate
86;00:10:46,150;00:10:48,232;once we set sail.
87;00:10:48,233;00:10:51,149;I saved your life.
88;00:10:51,150;00:10:53,899;If they catch you,
88;00:10:51,150;00:10:53,899;they catch me.
89;00:10:53,900;00:10:55,941;I cannot say
89;00:10:53,900;00:10:55,941;I feel overly guilty
90;00:10:55,942;00:10:58,024;about leaving you
90;00:10:55,942;00:10:58,024;in that fucking crate.
91;00:10:58,025;00:11:00,732;Do you know what it's like
91;00:10:58,025;00:11:00,732;to stuff your shit
92;00:11:00,733;00:11:02,399;through one of those airholes?
93;00:11:02,400;00:11:03,691;No, I only know what it's like
94;00:11:03,692;00:11:06,858;to pick up your shit
94;00:11:03,692;00:11:06,858;and throw it overboard.
95;00:11:10,192;00:11:12,482;Pentos?
96;00:11:12,483;00:11:14,941;The home of my colleague
96;00:11:12,483;00:11:14,941;Illyrio Mopatis,
97;00:11:14,942;00:11:17,316;a merchant.
98;00:11:17,317;00:11:19,274;He and I met many years ago
99;00:11:19,275;00:11:20,691;through mutual friends.
100;00:11:20,692;00:11:24,066;A group of people
100;00:11:20,692;00:11:24,066;who saw Robert Baratheon
101;00:11:24,067;00:11:25,524;for the disaster he was.
102;00:11:25,525;00:11:28,566;We tried to do what
102;00:11:25,525;00:11:28,566;was best for the realm
103;00:11:28,567;00:11:32,107;by supporting
103;00:11:28,567;00:11:32,107;a Targaryen restoration.
104;00:11:32,108;00:11:34,732;And thus began
104;00:11:32,108;00:11:34,732;the chain of mistakes
105;00:11:34,733;00:11:37,357;that has led us both here.
106;00:11:37,358;00:11:40,816;Things have gotten worse,
106;00:11:37,358;00:11:40,816;not better.
107;00:11:40,817;00:11:43,900;Westeros needs to be
107;00:11:40,817;00:11:43,900;saved from itself.
108;00:11:47,650;00:11:49,524;Mmm.
109;00:11:49,525;00:11:50,982;Much better.
110;00:11:50,983;00:11:52,650;My lord?
111;00:11:54,692;00:11:57,524;I don't think I am anymore.
112;00:11:57,525;00:11:59,733;A lord.
113;00:12:07,567;00:12:09,525;Are you a lord
113;00:12:07,567;00:12:09,525;if you kill your father?
114;00:12:11,900;00:12:15,566;I don't imagine
114;00:12:11,900;00:12:15,566;they revoke your nobility
115;00:12:15,567;00:12:17,524;for killing a whore.
116;00:12:17,525;00:12:19,441;It must happen all the time.
117;00:12:19,442;00:12:21,857;You already drank yourself
117;00:12:19,442;00:12:21,857;across the Narrow Sea.
118;00:12:21,858;00:12:23,441;In a box.
118;00:12:21,858;00:12:23,441;Why stop now?
119;00:12:23,442;00:12:26,858;Because we are talking
119;00:12:23,442;00:12:26,858;about the future of our country.
120;00:12:30,733;00:12:33,442;The future is shit.
121;00:12:35,650;00:12:37,525;Just like the past.
122;00:14:29,233;00:14:31,236;_
123;00:14:31,356;00:14:32,521;_

127;00:14:57,692;00:14:58,899;Shh.
128;00:14:58,900;00:15:00,608;Shh.
129;00:15:45,108;00:15:46,899;The Sons of the Harpy?
130;00:15:46,900;00:15:49,232;Yes, Your Grace.
130;00:15:46,900;00:15:49,232;They left it on the body.
131;00:15:49,233;00:15:50,566;They've never killed before.
132;00:15:50,567;00:15:53,066;It was only a matter
132;00:15:50,567;00:15:53,066;of time, Your Grace.
133;00:15:53,067;00:15:55,566;Conquerors always meet
133;00:15:53,067;00:15:55,566;with resistance.
134;00:15:55,567;00:15:57,649;I didn't conquer them.
134;00:15:55,567;00:15:57,649;Their own people did.
135;00:15:57,650;00:16:01,654;_

137;00:16:05,983;00:16:08,732;He did not risk his life
137;00:16:05,983;00:16:08,732;fighting for his freedom
138;00:16:08,733;00:16:10,732;so cowards in masks
138;00:16:08,733;00:16:10,732;could take it away.
139;00:16:10,733;00:16:12,232;And I did not take up
139;00:16:10,733;00:16:12,232;residence in this pyramid
140;00:16:12,233;00:16:15,691;so I could watch the city below
140;00:16:12,233;00:16:15,691;decline into chaos.
141;00:16:15,692;00:16:18,232;What was the name
141;00:16:15,692;00:16:18,232;of the man you lost?
142;00:16:18,233;00:16:21,691;White Rat, Your Grace.
143;00:16:21,692;00:16:25,857;I want him buried
143;00:16:21,692;00:16:25,857;with honor, publically
144;00:16:25,858;00:16:28,274;in the Temple of the Graces.

145;00:16:28,275;00:16:30,316;will hear that message.
146;00:16:30,317;00:16:32,024;Make them very angry.
147;00:16:32,025;00:16:33,982;Angry snakes lash out.
148;00:16:33,983;00:16:36,691;Makes chopping off their heads
148;00:16:33,983;00:16:36,691;that much easier.
149;00:16:36,692;00:16:40,108;Find the men who did this
149;00:16:36,692;00:16:40,108;and bring them to me.
150;00:16:43,483;00:16:45,153;Your Grace.
151;00:16:58,983;00:17:00,982;Torgo Nudho.
152;00:17:00,983;00:17:02,858;Missandei hin Naath.
153;00:17:05,150;00:17:06,442;I wanted to speak with you.
154;00:17:15,275;00:17:17,607;Why do you come?
155;00:17:17,608;00:17:20,567;White Rat, the Unsullied who...
156;00:17:22,858;00:17:26,067;I have heard they found
156;00:17:22,858;00:17:26,067;his body in a brothel.
157;00:17:27,317;00:17:30,232;I have heard that
157;00:17:27,317;00:17:30,232;more than one Unsullied
158;00:17:30,233;00:17:32,900;has been known to visit
158;00:17:30,233;00:17:32,900;Meereen's brothels.
159;00:17:35,900;00:17:37,400;May I ask you why?
160;00:17:39,150;00:17:41,483;Why would an Unsullied
160;00:17:39,150;00:17:41,483;go to a brothel?
161;00:17:45,067;00:17:47,983;I do not know.
162;00:17:48,900;00:17:51,525;I must go.
163;00:18:06,908;00:18:09,032;Get your shield up.
163;00:18:06,908;00:18:09,032;It's too heavy.
164;00:18:09,033;00:18:11,324;If it wasn't heavy,
164;00:18:09,033;00:18:11,324;it wouldn't stop a sword.
165;00:18:11,325;00:18:12,867;Now get it up.
166;00:18:24,533;00:18:28,032;Come.
166;00:18:24,533;00:18:28,032;Try it again.
167;00:18:28,033;00:18:31,157;Drive at me.
167;00:18:28,033;00:18:31,157;Keep your shield up.
168;00:18:31,158;00:18:33,616;Or I'll ring
168;00:18:31,158;00:18:33,616;your head like a bell.
169;00:18:33,617;00:18:36,407;Shouldn't you be training, too?
170;00:18:36,408;00:18:38,908;Well, I'm hardly a new recruit.
171;00:18:41,900;00:18:44,441;How many brothers can say that they've
171;00:18:41,900;00:18:44,441;killed a white walker and a Thenn?
172;00:18:44,442;00:18:47,566;I might be the first in history.
173;00:18:47,567;00:18:49,482;- Shield up.
173;00:18:47,567;00:18:49,482;- These men need a firm hand.
174;00:18:49,483;00:18:51,232;Always have.
175;00:18:51,233;00:18:53,400;They're poachers and thieves.
176;00:18:56,067;00:18:57,983;Not soldiers.
177;00:19:03,817;00:19:05,567;That one hates me.
178;00:19:07,692;00:19:09,899;If Ser Alliser
178;00:19:07,692;00:19:09,899;is chosen as the new Lord Commander...
179;00:19:09,900;00:19:13,566;He hates the wildlings.
180;00:19:13,567;00:19:15,357;All the wildlings.
181;00:19:15,358;00:19:17,941;Don't let them send us away.
181;00:19:15,358;00:19:17,941;It's not a sure thing.
182;00:19:17,942;00:19:20,482;Ser Denys Mallister has
182;00:19:17,942;00:19:20,482;commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years
183;00:19:20,483;00:19:22,316;and people say he's a good man.
184;00:19:22,317;00:19:23,441;He's running against
184;00:19:22,317;00:19:23,441;Ser Alliser...
185;00:19:23,442;00:19:26,066;Sam, don't let them
185;00:19:23,442;00:19:26,066;send us away.
186;00:19:26,067;00:19:27,316;I told you.
187;00:19:27,317;00:19:30,441;Wherever you go, I go, too.
188;00:19:30,442;00:19:32,733;You can't leave.
188;00:19:30,442;00:19:32,733;They'll execute you.
189;00:19:40,733;00:19:42,693;Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot.
189;00:19:40,733;00:19:42,693;Yah!
190;00:19:44,358;00:19:45,442;Shield up.
191;00:19:48,025;00:19:49,900;The king wants a word.
192;00:20:17,958;00:20:20,124;You're not cold, my lady?
193;00:20:20,125;00:20:22,291;Never.
194;00:20:22,292;00:20:26,292;The Lord's fire lives
194;00:20:22,292;00:20:26,292;within me, Jon Snow.
195;00:20:28,642;00:20:30,433;Feel.
196;00:20:37,683;00:20:39,517;Are you a virgin?
197;00:20:42,975;00:20:45,058;No.
198;00:20:46,642;00:20:48,517;Good.
199;00:20:55,225;00:20:57,682;Your Grace.
200;00:20:57,683;00:20:59,892;The bastard of Winterfell.
201;00:21:08,783;00:21:11,825;You know who rules
201;00:21:08,783;00:21:11,825;at Winterfell now?
202;00:21:12,192;00:21:13,982;Roose Bolton.
203;00:21:13,983;00:21:17,275;Mmm, the traitor who plunged a dagger
203;00:21:13,983;00:21:17,275;in Robb Stark's heart.
204;00:21:18,233;00:21:20,817;Don't you want to avenge him?
205;00:21:21,850;00:21:24,849;I want a great
205;00:21:21,850;00:21:24,849;many things, Your Grace.
206;00:21:24,850;00:21:27,349;But I'm a sworn brother
206;00:21:24,850;00:21:27,349;of the Night's Watch now.
207;00:21:27,350;00:21:30,682;I've been talking
207;00:21:27,350;00:21:30,682;to your sworn brothers.
208;00:21:30,683;00:21:32,391;Many of them love you.
208;00:21:30,683;00:21:32,391;They're good men.
209;00:21:32,392;00:21:34,099;Many don't.
210;00:21:34,100;00:21:38,099;You were seen taking the body
210;00:21:34,100;00:21:38,099;of a wildling girl north of the Wall.
211;00:21:38,100;00:21:39,766;Why?
212;00:21:39,767;00:21:40,974;It's where she belonged.
213;00:21:40,975;00:21:43,391;Some of the Night's
213;00:21:40,975;00:21:43,391;Watch feel you have
214;00:21:43,392;00:21:45,349;too much affection
214;00:21:43,392;00:21:45,349;for the wildlings.
215;00:21:45,350;00:21:47,766;They were born on the
215;00:21:45,350;00:21:47,766;wrong side of the Wall.
216;00:21:47,767;00:21:49,807;That doesn't make them monsters.
217;00:21:49,808;00:21:51,099;No matter.
218;00:21:51,100;00:21:52,099;I shall take back the North
219;00:21:52,100;00:21:54,016;from the thieves who stole it.
220;00:21:54,017;00:21:56,599;Tywin Lannister is dead.
220;00:21:54,017;00:21:56,599;He can't protect them now.
221;00:21:56,600;00:22:00,182;I shall mount Roose Bolton's
221;00:21:56,600;00:22:00,182;head on a spike.
222;00:22:00,183;00:22:02,891;But if I'm to take Winterfell,
222;00:22:00,183;00:22:02,891;I need more men.
223;00:22:02,892;00:22:04,891;The men of the Night's Watch
223;00:22:02,892;00:22:04,891;are sworn to play no part...
224;00:22:04,892;00:22:07,891;I'm not talking about
224;00:22:04,892;00:22:07,891;the damn Night's Watch.
225;00:22:07,892;00:22:09,642;I'm talking about the wildlings.
226;00:22:17,642;00:22:21,766;Your Grace,
226;00:22:17,642;00:22:21,766;you want the wildlings
227;00:22:21,767;00:22:23,766;to march in your army?
228;00:22:23,767;00:22:25,057;If they swear to follow me,
228;00:22:23,767;00:22:25,057;I'll pardon them.
229;00:22:25,058;00:22:27,641;We'll take Winterfell.
229;00:22:25,058;00:22:27,641;Once the North is won,
230;00:22:27,642;00:22:28,557;I'll declare them
230;00:22:27,642;00:22:28,557;citizens of the realm.
231;00:22:28,558;00:22:30,766;I'll give them land to live on.
232;00:22:30,767;00:22:34,932;It's a fair offer.
232;00:22:30,767;00:22:34,932;More than fair.
233;00:22:34,933;00:22:36,891;I'll offer them their lives
233;00:22:34,933;00:22:36,891;and their freedom
234;00:22:36,892;00:22:39,932;if Mance kneels before me
234;00:22:36,892;00:22:39,932;and swears his loyalty.
235;00:22:39,933;00:22:41,054;I don't think that's likely.
236;00:22:43,892;00:22:45,307;You admire him, don't you?
237;00:22:45,308;00:22:48,057;I respect him.
237;00:22:45,308;00:22:48,057;He likes you.
238;00:22:48,058;00:22:49,974;Convince him to bend the knee...
238;00:22:48,058;00:22:49,974;Your Grace.
239;00:22:49,975;00:22:51,308;...or he burns.
240;00:22:55,225;00:22:56,682;How much time do I have?
241;00:22:56,683;00:22:58,349;Nightfall.
242;00:22:58,350;00:23:00,641;The sun drops fast
242;00:22:58,350;00:23:00,641;this time of year.
243;00:23:00,642;00:23:02,307;Hurry, Jon Snow.
244;00:23:05,933;00:23:07,516;Shield up.
245;00:23:07,517;00:23:10,349;Attack, my lord!
246;00:23:10,350;00:23:11,724;Attack!
247;00:23:11,725;00:23:15,349;Don't cross your feet.
248;00:23:15,350;00:23:17,099;My sons had swords
248;00:23:15,350;00:23:17,099;in their hands
249;00:23:17,100;00:23:18,724;from the time they could walk.
249;00:23:17,100;00:23:18,724;This one...
250;00:23:18,725;00:23:20,891;Lord Arryn will never
250;00:23:18,725;00:23:20,891;be a great warrior.
251;00:23:20,892;00:23:22,891;Great warrior?
252;00:23:22,892;00:23:25,516;He swings a sword
252;00:23:22,892;00:23:25,516;like a girl with palsy.
253;00:23:25,517;00:23:28,432;My lord.
254;00:23:28,433;00:23:30,307;Sword up, my lord!
255;00:23:37,808;00:23:39,682;Some boys develop more slowly.
256;00:23:39,683;00:23:41,974;He's still young.
257;00:23:41,975;00:23:45,099;He's 13.
257;00:23:41,975;00:23:45,099;Boys go to war at 13.
258;00:23:45,100;00:23:47,141;He has other gifts.
258;00:23:45,100;00:23:47,141;Does he?
259;00:23:47,142;00:23:49,932;The gift of a great name.
260;00:23:49,933;00:23:53,682;Sometimes that's all one needs.
261;00:23:58,642;00:24:01,391;Good-bye, Lord Royce, and thank you
261;00:23:58,642;00:24:01,391;for all you've done for me.
262;00:24:01,392;00:24:03,807;I have done nothing more
262;00:24:01,392;00:24:03,807;than my duty, my lady.
263;00:24:03,808;00:24:05,141;I have no doubt
263;00:24:03,808;00:24:05,141;that on my return,
264;00:24:05,142;00:24:08,099;Robin's skills will have
264;00:24:05,142;00:24:08,099;improved immeasurably.
265;00:24:08,100;00:24:09,266;He'll be safe here.
266;00:24:09,267;00:24:13,224;As for his skills,
267;00:24:13,225;00:24:15,433;I make no promises.
268;00:24:28,392;00:24:31,599;Will we head north
268;00:24:28,392;00:24:31,599;at some point?
269;00:24:31,600;00:24:34,891;He said Sansa had a brother
269;00:24:31,600;00:24:34,891;at Castle Black.
270;00:24:34,892;00:24:36,516;We're a few days' ride
270;00:24:34,892;00:24:36,516;from the Kingsroad.
271;00:24:36,517;00:24:39,600;But that will take us...
271;00:24:36,517;00:24:39,600;Us?
272;00:24:41,850;00:24:44,141;The only reason you're here
272;00:24:41,850;00:24:44,141;is because Jaime Lannister
273;00:24:44,142;00:24:45,808;told me you weren't
273;00:24:44,142;00:24:45,808;safe in the capital.
274;00:24:47,933;00:24:50,891;You're hundreds of miles
274;00:24:47,933;00:24:50,891;from King's Landing.
275;00:24:50,892;00:24:52,891;No one knows what you look like.
276;00:24:52,892;00:24:55,307;No one cares.
276;00:24:52,892;00:24:55,307;You're safe.
277;00:24:55,308;00:24:58,808;But I'm your squire.
277;00:24:55,308;00:24:58,808;Do you even know what a squire is?
278;00:25:00,600;00:25:01,391;An attendant to a knight.
279;00:25:01,392;00:25:04,016;I'm not a knight.
280;00:25:04,017;00:25:06,266;That means you're not a squire.
281;00:25:06,267;00:25:07,349;Well, where would I go?
282;00:25:07,350;00:25:10,225;I don't care.
282;00:25:07,350;00:25:10,225;I'm not your mother.
283;00:25:18,892;00:25:21,016;You swore to find
283;00:25:18,892;00:25:21,016;the Stark girls.
284;00:25:21,017;00:25:23,807;I found Arya. She didn't want
284;00:25:21,017;00:25:23,807;my protection.
285;00:25:23,808;00:25:26,017;Sansa still might.
285;00:25:23,808;00:25:26,017;Will you shut your mouth?
286;00:25:27,183;00:25:29,017;I didn't ask for your advice.
287;00:25:30,850;00:25:33,682;I don't want anyone
287;00:25:30,850;00:25:33,682;following me.
288;00:25:33,683;00:25:35,599;I'm not a leader.
289;00:25:35,600;00:25:38,599;All I ever wanted
289;00:25:35,600;00:25:38,599;was to fight for a lord I believed in.
290;00:25:38,600;00:25:41,517;The good lords are dead
290;00:25:38,600;00:25:41,517;and the rest are monsters.
291;00:25:51,817;00:25:54,066;You told Lord Royce
291;00:25:51,817;00:25:54,066;we were going to the Fingers.
292;00:25:54,067;00:25:56,274;I did.
293;00:25:56,275;00:25:59,399;But we're heading west.
293;00:25:56,275;00:25:59,399;We are.
294;00:25:59,400;00:26:01,358;If he wanted to betray us,
294;00:25:59,400;00:26:01,358;he already would have.
295;00:26:02,900;00:26:06,649;Lord Royce might be as honorable
295;00:26:02,900;00:26:06,649;as he thinks he is,
296;00:26:06,650;00:26:09,024;but he's not alone
296;00:26:06,650;00:26:09,024;in that castle.
297;00:26:09,025;00:26:10,107;Do you trust all those
297;00:26:09,025;00:26:10,107;knights and ladies,
298;00:26:10,108;00:26:13,316;stable boys and serving girls?
299;00:26:13,317;00:26:16,274;No, do you trust the carriage driver
299;00:26:13,317;00:26:16,274;or the knights escorting us?
300;00:26:16,275;00:26:17,732;No.
301;00:26:17,733;00:26:20,357;But I pay them well
302;00:26:20,358;00:26:22,649;and they've seen what happens
302;00:26:20,358;00:26:22,649;to men who disappoint me.
303;00:26:22,650;00:26:25,024;So where are we going?
304;00:26:25,025;00:26:27,441;To a land where
304;00:26:25,025;00:26:27,441;you trust everyone?
305;00:26:27,442;00:26:30,191;To a land so far from here,
306;00:26:30,192;00:26:32,112;even Cersei Lannister
306;00:26:30,192;00:26:32,112;can't get her hands on you.
307;00:26:41,083;00:26:44,167;It was such a deep,
307;00:26:41,083;00:26:44,167;deep shock to us all.
308;00:26:47,708;00:26:48,874;Your father was a...
309;00:26:48,875;00:26:51,832;A force to be reckoned with.
310;00:26:51,833;00:26:53,041;He truly was.
311;00:26:53,042;00:26:56,207;I wouldn't presume to claim
312;00:26:56,208;00:26:58,541;to have known him
312;00:26:56,208;00:26:58,541;as such, but...
313;00:26:58,542;00:27:02,082;But just being in his presence was enough
313;00:26:58,542;00:27:02,082;to make it so clear
314;00:27:02,083;00:27:04,249;just how formidable
314;00:27:02,083;00:27:04,249;a person you were dealing with.
315;00:27:04,250;00:27:07,624;What a... what a force
315;00:27:04,250;00:27:07,624;to be reckoned with.
316;00:27:10,167;00:27:12,542;Thank you so much
316;00:27:10,167;00:27:12,542;for your kind words.
317;00:27:17,608;00:27:20,149;Deepest condolences, Your Grace.
318;00:27:20,150;00:27:22,191;This tragedy...
318;00:27:20,150;00:27:22,191;I never trusted Varys.
319;00:27:22,192;00:27:25,233;I often warned...
320;00:27:27,942;00:27:30,067;Your Grace.
321;00:27:32,817;00:27:35,316;Cousin Lancel.
321;00:27:32,817;00:27:35,316;I hardly recognized you.
322;00:27:35,317;00:27:37,607;My deepest sympathies.
323;00:27:37,608;00:27:40,732;I apologize
323;00:27:37,608;00:27:40,732;for my son's appearance.
324;00:27:40,733;00:27:41,854;Uncle, it's quite all right.
325;00:27:45,275;00:27:47,316;They call themselves sparrows.
326;00:27:47,317;00:27:50,024;Bloody fanatics.
327;00:27:50,025;00:27:52,024;Religion has its place,
327;00:27:50,025;00:27:52,024;of course,
328;00:27:52,025;00:27:54,857;but at a certain point...
329;00:27:54,858;00:27:57,816;They never would have come to the capital
329;00:27:54,858;00:27:57,816;when Tywin was alive.
330;00:27:57,817;00:27:59,482;I'm sure he'll grow out of it,
331;00:27:59,483;00:28:01,482;whatever it is.
332;00:28:01,483;00:28:04,025;Excuse me.
332;00:28:01,483;00:28:04,025;Of course.
333;00:28:22,542;00:28:25,249;Your wounds from the Blackwater
333;00:28:22,542;00:28:25,249;seem to have healed.
334;00:28:25,250;00:28:27,625;It wasn't my wounds
334;00:28:25,250;00:28:27,625;that needed healing.
335;00:28:30,333;00:28:33,250;What can I do for you?
336;00:28:34,250;00:28:36,499;You can forgive me.
337;00:28:36,500;00:28:39,332;What could you possibly
337;00:28:36,500;00:28:39,332;have done to warrant my forgiveness?
338;00:28:39,333;00:28:42,041;I led you into the darkness.
339;00:28:42,042;00:28:43,457;I doubt you've ever
339;00:28:42,042;00:28:43,457;led anyone anywhere.
340;00:28:43,458;00:28:46,249;I tempted you into our...
341;00:28:46,250;00:28:49,500;unnatural relations.
342;00:28:51,042;00:28:53,500;And, of course,
342;00:28:51,042;00:28:53,500;there was the king...
343;00:28:55,083;00:28:57,917;his boar hunt.
344;00:28:59,917;00:29:01,000;His wine.
345;00:29:04,667;00:29:06,541;I don't know what
345;00:29:04,667;00:29:06,541;you're talking about.
346;00:29:06,542;00:29:09,792;I'm a different person now.
347;00:29:11,583;00:29:14,332;I've found peace
347;00:29:11,583;00:29:14,332;in the light of the Seven.
348;00:29:14,333;00:29:15,999;You can, too.
349;00:29:16,000;00:29:17,624;They watch over all of us,
350;00:29:17,625;00:29:20,166;ready to dole out mercy
351;00:29:20,167;00:29:21,667;or justice.
352;00:29:24,542;00:29:27,417;Their world is at hand.
353;00:29:30,167;00:29:31,832;I will pray for
353;00:29:30,167;00:29:31,832;your father's soul.
354;00:29:34,417;00:29:38,000;The day Tywin Lannister's
354;00:29:34,417;00:29:38,000;soul needs your help...
355;00:29:46,833;00:29:49,291;It looks like Dorne.
355;00:29:46,833;00:29:49,291;It doesn't.
356;00:29:49,292;00:29:52,207;It does.
357;00:29:52,208;00:29:56,333;That's the...
357;00:29:52,208;00:29:56,333;That's the Sunspear bit right there.
358;00:29:57,542;00:29:59,249;And that's where
358;00:29:57,542;00:29:59,249;the mountains are.
359;00:29:59,250;00:30:02,582;And over here is...
360;00:30:02,583;00:30:05,374;Is Sunsnake?
361;00:30:05,375;00:30:05,999;Stonespear?
362;00:30:06,000;00:30:08,499;Sandstone.
363;00:30:08,500;00:30:10,082;Yes.
364;00:30:10,083;00:30:12,499;Yes, Sandstone.
365;00:30:13,917;00:30:15,249;Just there.
366;00:30:15,250;00:30:17,250;Fine.
367;00:30:19,958;00:30:20,958;It's Dorne.
368;00:30:22,917;00:30:25,124;We should go there.
369;00:30:25,125;00:30:27,499;I think we would
369;00:30:25,125;00:30:27,499;have a lovely time,
370;00:30:27,500;00:30:29,874;judging by my experience.
371;00:30:29,875;00:30:34,624;That would be wonderful.
371;00:30:29,875;00:30:34,624;Dorne, Highgarden.
372;00:30:34,625;00:30:36,167;Anywhere but here.
373;00:30:45,292;00:30:47,208;We're late for dinner as it is.
374;00:30:48,000;00:30:49,624;You're very respectful.
375;00:30:49,625;00:30:50,625;I'm very hungry.
376;00:31:08,167;00:31:10,957;What's your name?
377;00:31:10,958;00:31:12,624;Olyvar, my lady.
378;00:31:12,625;00:31:14,457;I'm afraid my brother
379;00:31:14,458;00:31:17,917;is keeping the king
379;00:31:14,458;00:31:17,917;waiting, Olyvar.
380;00:31:26,792;00:31:28,625;My lady.
381;00:31:41,925;00:31:45,674;Perhaps you might
381;00:31:41,925;00:31:45,674;consider being a bit more discreet?
382;00:31:45,675;00:31:47,424;Why?
383;00:31:47,425;00:31:49,757;They all know about me anyway.
384;00:31:49,758;00:31:53,049;Everybody knows everything
384;00:31:49,758;00:31:53,049;about everyone.
385;00:31:53,050;00:31:56,216;What's the point in trying to
385;00:31:53,050;00:31:56,216;keep a secret in a place like this?
386;00:31:56,217;00:31:59,508;In any event, you shouldn't
386;00:31:56,217;00:31:59,508;keep your intended waiting.
387;00:31:59,717;00:32:02,424;My intended?
387;00:31:59,717;00:32:02,424;Please.
388;00:32:02,425;00:32:03,841;Tywin's dead.
389;00:32:03,842;00:32:06,257;That means no one
389;00:32:03,842;00:32:06,257;can force Cersei to marry me.
390;00:32:06,258;00:32:08,466;Lucky you.
390;00:32:06,258;00:32:08,466;Unlucky you.
391;00:32:08,467;00:32:09,924;You think I want that woman
391;00:32:08,467;00:32:09,924;married to my brother?
392;00:32:09,925;00:32:14,007;If she doesn't marry me,
392;00:32:09,925;00:32:14,007;she doesn't go to Highgarden.
393;00:32:14,008;00:32:16,716;Which means she stays
393;00:32:14,008;00:32:16,716;in King's Landing.
394;00:32:16,717;00:32:19,299;Which means you're trapped here with
394;00:32:16,717;00:32:19,299;Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.
395;00:32:19,300;00:32:20,883;Perhaps.
396;00:32:22,925;00:32:24,966;Perhaps?
397;00:32:24,967;00:32:25,967;Perhaps.
398;00:32:39,308;00:32:43,182;Eunuch, the Spider, the
398;00:32:39,308;00:32:43,182;Master of Whisperers.
399;00:32:43,183;00:32:46,475;Imp, Half-man.
400;00:32:48,808;00:32:51,141;There are faster ways
400;00:32:48,808;00:32:51,141;to kill yourself.
401;00:32:51,142;00:32:52,891;Not for a coward.
402;00:32:52,892;00:32:54,932;You are many things, my friend,
403;00:32:54,933;00:32:56,683;but not a coward.
404;00:33:00,642;00:33:03,016;You never told me
404;00:33:00,642;00:33:03,016;why you set me free.
405;00:33:03,017;00:33:06,016;Your brother asked me to.
406;00:33:06,017;00:33:07,266;Could have said no.
407;00:33:07,267;00:33:10,516;Refuse the Kingslayer?
407;00:33:07,267;00:33:10,516;A dangerous proposition.
408;00:33:10,517;00:33:12,766;Not as dangerous
408;00:33:10,517;00:33:12,766;as releasing me.
409;00:33:12,767;00:33:15,474;You risked your life,
409;00:33:12,767;00:33:15,474;your position, everything.
410;00:33:15,475;00:33:18,141;Why? You're not family.
410;00:33:15,475;00:33:18,141;You owe me nothing.
411;00:33:18,142;00:33:19,724;I didn't do it for you.
412;00:33:19,725;00:33:22,766;I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
413;00:33:22,767;00:33:26,016;A drunken dwarf will never be the savior
413;00:33:22,767;00:33:26,016;of the Seven Kingdoms.
414;00:33:26,017;00:33:28,266;I don't believe in saviors.
415;00:33:28,267;00:33:31,642;I believe men of talent
415;00:33:28,267;00:33:31,642;have a part to play in the war to come.
416;00:33:33,433;00:33:35,057;You're going to have
416;00:33:33,433;00:33:35,057;to find another soldier.
417;00:33:35,058;00:33:39,141;I'm done with Westeros
417;00:33:35,058;00:33:39,141;and Westeros is done with me.
418;00:33:39,142;00:33:42,349;You have many
418;00:33:39,142;00:33:42,349;admirable qualities,
419;00:33:42,350;00:33:43,724;self-pity is not
419;00:33:42,350;00:33:43,724;one of them.
420;00:33:43,725;00:33:46,016;Any fool with a bit of luck
421;00:33:46,017;00:33:49,557;can find himself
421;00:33:46,017;00:33:49,557;born into power.
422;00:33:49,558;00:33:53,224;But earning it for yourself,
422;00:33:49,558;00:33:53,224;that takes work.
423;00:33:53,225;00:33:55,766;I'm not well-suited
423;00:33:53,225;00:33:55,766;for work.
424;00:33:55,767;00:33:57,391;I think you are.
425;00:33:57,392;00:33:59,474;You have your father's
425;00:33:57,392;00:33:59,474;instincts for politics.
426;00:33:59,475;00:34:01,057;And you have compassion.
427;00:34:01,058;00:34:04,266;Compassion? Yes.
428;00:34:04,267;00:34:06,891;I killed my lover
428;00:34:04,267;00:34:06,891;with my bare hands.
429;00:34:06,892;00:34:10,682;I shot my own father
429;00:34:06,892;00:34:10,682;with a crossbow.
430;00:34:10,683;00:34:12,724;I never said you were perfect.
431;00:34:12,725;00:34:16,682;What is it you want exactly?
432;00:34:16,683;00:34:18,682;Peace.
433;00:34:18,683;00:34:20,141;Prosperity.
434;00:34:20,142;00:34:24,224;A land where the powerful
434;00:34:20,142;00:34:24,224;do not prey on the powerless.
435;00:34:24,225;00:34:26,682;Where the castles
435;00:34:24,225;00:34:26,682;are made of gingerbread
436;00:34:26,683;00:34:29,182;and the moats are filled
436;00:34:26,683;00:34:29,182;with blackberry wine.
437;00:34:29,183;00:34:31,474;The powerful have always
437;00:34:29,183;00:34:31,474;preyed on the powerless.
438;00:34:31,475;00:34:33,891;That's how they became powerful
438;00:34:31,475;00:34:33,891;in the first place.
439;00:34:33,892;00:34:35,807;Perhaps.
440;00:34:35,808;00:34:39,391;And perhaps we've grown
440;00:34:35,808;00:34:39,391;so used to horror,
441;00:34:39,392;00:34:41,017;we assume there's no other way.
442;00:34:42,100;00:34:44,807;If you sat on the Iron Throne,
443;00:34:44,808;00:34:46,974;would you spread misery
443;00:34:44,808;00:34:46,974;throughout the land?
444;00:34:46,975;00:34:49,391;I will never sit
444;00:34:46,975;00:34:49,391;on the Iron Throne.
445;00:34:49,392;00:34:51,807;No, you won't.
446;00:34:51,808;00:34:54,182;But you could help another
446;00:34:51,808;00:34:54,182;climb those steps
447;00:34:54,183;00:34:56,682;and take that seat.
448;00:34:56,683;00:34:59,724;The Seven Kingdoms
448;00:34:56,683;00:34:59,724;need someone stronger than Tommen,
449;00:34:59,725;00:35:02,016;but gentler than Stannis.
450;00:35:02,017;00:35:04,932;A monarch who can intimidate the
450;00:35:02,017;00:35:04,932;high lords and inspire the people.
451;00:35:04,933;00:35:09,016;A ruler loved by millions
451;00:35:04,933;00:35:09,016;with a powerful army
452;00:35:09,017;00:35:10,891;and the right family name.
453;00:35:10,892;00:35:13,182;Good luck finding him.
454;00:35:13,183;00:35:16,225;Who said anything about him?
455;00:35:20,183;00:35:22,557;You have a choice, my friend.
456;00:35:22,558;00:35:24,557;You can stay here
456;00:35:22,558;00:35:24,557;at Illyrio's palace
457;00:35:24,558;00:35:27,141;and drink yourself to death,
458;00:35:27,142;00:35:28,474;or you can ride with me
458;00:35:27,142;00:35:28,474;to Meereen,
459;00:35:28,475;00:35:30,932;meet Daenerys Targaryen,
460;00:35:30,933;00:35:33,350;and decide if the world
460;00:35:30,933;00:35:33,350;is worth fighting for.
461;00:35:35,100;00:35:39,433;Can I drink myself to death
461;00:35:35,100;00:35:39,433;on the road to Meereen?
462;00:35:49,675;00:35:53,174;When did the Unsullied
462;00:35:49,675;00:35:53,174;start patrolling the streets of Meereen?
463;00:35:53,175;00:35:56,008;Looks like your friends haven't
463;00:35:53,175;00:35:56,008;been behaving themselves.
464;00:35:58,342;00:36:02,174;Our mission to Yunkai
464;00:35:58,342;00:36:02,174;was a resounding success.
465;00:36:02,175;00:36:04,757;The Wise Masters of Yunkai
465;00:36:02,175;00:36:04,757;have agreed to cede power
466;00:36:04,758;00:36:06,632;to a council of elders
466;00:36:04,758;00:36:06,632;made up of both
467;00:36:06,633;00:36:09,049;the freed men and
467;00:36:06,633;00:36:09,049;the former slaveholders.
468;00:36:09,050;00:36:11,174;All matters of consequence will be
468;00:36:09,050;00:36:11,174;brought to you for review.
469;00:36:11,175;00:36:12,924;Good.
470;00:36:12,925;00:36:15,466;They did ask
470;00:36:12,925;00:36:15,466;for some concessions.
471;00:36:15,467;00:36:17,216;Concessions?
472;00:36:17,217;00:36:20,299;Politics is the art
472;00:36:17,217;00:36:20,299;of compromise, Your Grace.
473;00:36:20,300;00:36:23,216;I'm not a politician.
473;00:36:20,300;00:36:23,216;I'm a queen.
474;00:36:23,217;00:36:26,466;Forgive me.
474;00:36:23,217;00:36:26,466;You're right, of course.
475;00:36:26,467;00:36:30,882;Still, it's easier to rule happy
475;00:36:26,467;00:36:30,882;subjects than angry ones.
476;00:36:30,883;00:36:32,882;I don't expect
476;00:36:30,883;00:36:32,882;the Wise Masters to be happy.
477;00:36:32,883;00:36:35,257;Slavery made them rich.
477;00:36:32,883;00:36:35,257;I ended slavery.
478;00:36:35,258;00:36:38,341;They do not ask
478;00:36:35,258;00:36:38,341;for the return of slavery.
479;00:36:38,342;00:36:40,925;They ask for the reopening
479;00:36:38,342;00:36:40,925;of the fighting pits.
480;00:36:42,842;00:36:44,591;The fighting pits?
481;00:36:44,592;00:36:46,091;Where slaves fought
481;00:36:44,592;00:36:46,091;slaves to the death?
482;00:36:46,092;00:36:48,966;In the new world
482;00:36:46,092;00:36:48,966;that you've brought to us,
483;00:36:48,967;00:36:51,300;free men would fight free men.
484;00:36:52,800;00:36:54,216;The pit fighters you liberated
485;00:36:54,217;00:36:56,299;plead for this opportunity.
486;00:36:56,300;00:36:58,632;Bring some here
486;00:36:56,300;00:36:58,632;and ask them yourself.
487;00:36:58,633;00:36:59,841;No fighting pits.
488;00:36:59,842;00:37:01,174;Opening them would show
488;00:36:59,842;00:37:01,174;the people of Yunkai
489;00:37:01,175;00:37:04,132;and Meereen that you
489;00:37:01,175;00:37:04,132;respect their traditions.
490;00:37:04,133;00:37:06,549;I do not respect the tradition of
490;00:37:04,133;00:37:06,549;human cockfighting.
491;00:37:06,550;00:37:09,800;If you... - How many times must I say no
491;00:37:06,550;00:37:09,800;before you understand?
492;00:37:12,217;00:37:15,591;Whatever he wants from me,
492;00:37:12,217;00:37:15,591;he's not going to get it.
493;00:37:15,592;00:37:18,132;If he really believes
493;00:37:15,592;00:37:18,132;I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...
494;00:37:18,133;00:37:20,299;You should reopen
494;00:37:18,133;00:37:20,299;the fighting pits.
495;00:37:20,300;00:37:23,174;What?
496;00:37:23,175;00:37:24,800;My mother was a whore.
496;00:37:23,175;00:37:24,800;I told you that.
497;00:37:26,883;00:37:29,549;She liked to drink pear brandy.
498;00:37:29,550;00:37:33,632;The older she got, the less
498;00:37:29,550;00:37:33,632;she made selling her body,
499;00:37:33,633;00:37:36,007;the more she wanted to drink.
500;00:37:36,008;00:37:39,216;So one day when I was 12,
500;00:37:36,008;00:37:39,216;she sold me to a slaver
501;00:37:39,217;00:37:41,841;she fucked the night before.
502;00:37:41,842;00:37:44,132;I'm sorry.
503;00:37:44,133;00:37:46,882;Why?
503;00:37:44,133;00:37:46,882;I was a bad child.
504;00:37:46,883;00:37:49,674;I wasn't big, but I was quick.
505;00:37:49,675;00:37:51,966;And I loved to fight.
506;00:37:51,967;00:37:53,966;So they sold me
506;00:37:51,967;00:37:53,966;to a man in Tolos
507;00:37:53,967;00:37:56,132;who trained fighters
507;00:37:53,967;00:37:56,132;for the pits.
508;00:37:56,133;00:37:58,757;I had my first match
508;00:37:56,133;00:37:58,757;when I was 16.
509;00:37:58,758;00:38:00,924;You were sold into slavery,
510;00:38:00,925;00:38:03,382;forced to fight to the death
510;00:38:00,925;00:38:03,382;for the amusement of the masters,
511;00:38:03,383;00:38:04,882;and you're defending
511;00:38:03,383;00:38:04,882;the fighting pits?
512;00:38:06,592;00:38:09,382;I'm only here
512;00:38:06,592;00:38:09,382;because of those pits.
513;00:38:09,383;00:38:12,007;I learned to fight
513;00:38:09,383;00:38:12,007;like a Dothraki screamer,
514;00:38:12,008;00:38:13,424;a Norvoshi priest,
514;00:38:12,008;00:38:13,424;a Westerosi knight.
515;00:38:13,425;00:38:16,049;Soon I was famous.
516;00:38:16,050;00:38:18,299;10,000 men and women
516;00:38:16,050;00:38:18,299;screamed my name
517;00:38:18,300;00:38:19,382;when I stepped into the pit.
518;00:38:19,383;00:38:20,882;I made so much money
518;00:38:19,383;00:38:20,882;for my master,
519;00:38:20,883;00:38:23,674;he set me free when he died.
520;00:38:23,675;00:38:25,466;I joined the Second Sons.
521;00:38:25,467;00:38:28,383;And then I met you.
522;00:38:33,883;00:38:35,216;You're the queen.
523;00:38:35,217;00:38:38,757;Everyone's too afraid
523;00:38:35,217;00:38:38,757;of you to speak truth.
524;00:38:38,758;00:38:41,341;Everyone but me.
525;00:38:41,342;00:38:45,549;You've made thousands
525;00:38:41,342;00:38:45,549;of enemies all across the world.
526;00:38:45,550;00:38:48,341;As soon as they see weakness,
527;00:38:48,342;00:38:50,591;they'll attack.
528;00:38:50,592;00:38:54,132;Show your strength here, now.
529;00:38:54,133;00:38:55,424;That's why I have the Unsullied
529;00:38:54,133;00:38:55,424;patrolling the streets.
530;00:38:58,508;00:39:02,049;Anyone with a chest
530;00:38:58,508;00:39:02,049;full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied.
531;00:39:02,050;00:39:05,799;You're not
531;00:39:02,050;00:39:05,799;the Mother of Unsullied.
532;00:39:05,800;00:39:06,960;You're the Mother of Dragons.
533;00:39:14,633;00:39:18,508;I don't want another child's bones
533;00:39:14,633;00:39:18,508;dropped at my feet.
534;00:39:19,508;00:39:22,382;No one's seen Drogon in weeks.
535;00:39:22,383;00:39:24,842;For all I know, he's flown halfway
535;00:39:22,383;00:39:24,842;across the world.
536;00:39:29,800;00:39:31,925;I can't control them anymore.
537;00:39:33,342;00:39:36,882;A dragon queen with no dragons
538;00:39:36,883;00:39:38,008;is not a queen.
539;00:40:44,425;00:40:46,717;Viserion?
540;00:40:48,717;00:40:50,592;Rhaegal?
541;00:41:02,592;00:41:04,132;Easy. Easy.
542;00:41:04,133;00:41:06,299;Easy.
543;00:41:45,717;00:41:47,924;So here we are.
544;00:41:47,925;00:41:49,008;Here we are.
545;00:41:51,800;00:41:55,591;When we first met,
545;00:41:51,800;00:41:55,591;you were my prisoner.
546;00:41:55,592;00:41:57,800;And now, for our last meeting...
547;00:42:00,133;00:42:03,591;This doesn't have to be
547;00:42:00,133;00:42:03,591;our last meeting.
548;00:42:03,592;00:42:06,008;No, but it will be.
549;00:42:08,550;00:42:10,882;You know what Stannis wants?
550;00:42:10,883;00:42:13,424;He wants me to bend the knee.
551;00:42:13,425;00:42:15,799;And he wants the free folk
551;00:42:13,425;00:42:15,799;to fight for him.
552;00:42:15,800;00:42:19,007;I'll give him this much,
553;00:42:19,008;00:42:20,341;he's bold.
554;00:42:20,342;00:42:21,882;Shouldn't a king be bold?
555;00:42:21,883;00:42:23,966;Oh, aye.
556;00:42:23,967;00:42:27,091;I respect him.
557;00:42:27,092;00:42:28,632;If he gets what he wants,
558;00:42:28,633;00:42:30,341;I expect he'll be a better ruler
558;00:42:28,633;00:42:30,341;than the fools
559;00:42:30,342;00:42:34,257;sitting on the Iron Throne
559;00:42:30,342;00:42:34,257;the last hundred years.
560;00:42:34,258;00:42:36,717;But I'll never serve him.
561;00:42:37,967;00:42:39,757;You told me you weren't
561;00:42:37,967;00:42:39,757;here to conquer.
562;00:42:39,758;00:42:41,091;You told me your people
562;00:42:39,758;00:42:41,091;have bled enough.
563;00:42:41,092;00:42:42,716;That's right.
564;00:42:42,717;00:42:46,007;I don't want them bleeding for
564;00:42:42,717;00:42:46,007;Stannis Baratheon either.
565;00:42:46,008;00:42:49,466;You spent your life convincing
565;00:42:46,008;00:42:49,466;90 clans to come together
566;00:42:49,467;00:42:50,549;for the first time in history.
567;00:42:50,550;00:42:53,716;Thenns and Hornfoots,
568;00:42:53,717;00:42:56,799;the ice-river clans,
568;00:42:53,717;00:42:56,799;even the giants.
569;00:42:56,800;00:42:59,799;A life's work uniting them.
569;00:42:56,800;00:42:59,799;You didn't do it for power.
570;00:42:59,800;00:43:03,174;You didn't do it for glory.
571;00:43:03,175;00:43:05,341;You brought them
571;00:43:03,175;00:43:05,341;together to save them
572;00:43:05,342;00:43:06,882;because none of them
572;00:43:05,342;00:43:06,882;will survive the winter,
573;00:43:06,883;00:43:08,757;not if they're north
573;00:43:06,883;00:43:08,757;of the Wall.
574;00:43:08,758;00:43:10,757;Isn't their survival
574;00:43:08,758;00:43:10,757;more important than your pride?
575;00:43:10,758;00:43:12,592;Pride?
576;00:43:14,758;00:43:17,300;Fuck my pride.
577;00:43:18,592;00:43:20,883;This isn't about that.
578;00:43:23,183;00:43:25,808;Then bend the knee
578;00:43:23,183;00:43:25,808;and save your people.
579;00:43:28,683;00:43:31,932;They followed me
579;00:43:28,683;00:43:31,932;because they respected me.
580;00:43:31,933;00:43:33,891;Because they believed in me.
581;00:43:33,892;00:43:36,266;The moment I kneel
581;00:43:33,892;00:43:36,266;for a southern king, that's all gone.
582;00:43:36,267;00:43:39,557;And how many tens of thousands
582;00:43:36,267;00:43:39,557;are out there right now?
583;00:43:39,558;00:43:42,807;How many women?
583;00:43:39,558;00:43:42,807;How many children?
584;00:43:42,808;00:43:45,849;And you won't go out and rescue
584;00:43:42,808;00:43:45,849;them because why?
585;00:43:45,850;00:43:48,057;You're afraid of looking afraid.
586;00:43:48,058;00:43:50,892;Oh, I am afraid.
587;00:43:51,517;00:43:53,683;No shame in that.
588;00:44:03,058;00:44:06,974;How will they do it?
588;00:44:03,058;00:44:06,974;Beheading?
589;00:44:06,975;00:44:08,850;Hanging?
590;00:44:11,558;00:44:14,142;They'll burn you alive.
591;00:44:18,808;00:44:20,600;Bad way to go.
592;00:44:24,725;00:44:26,557;I'll be honest with you.
593;00:44:26,558;00:44:28,557;I don't want to die.
594;00:44:28,558;00:44:30,724;And burnt to death,
595;00:44:30,725;00:44:32,682;I don't want people
595;00:44:30,725;00:44:32,682;to remember me like that,
596;00:44:32,683;00:44:34,557;scorched and screaming.
597;00:44:34,558;00:44:37,349;But it's better than betraying
598;00:44:37,350;00:44:39,057;everything I believe.
599;00:44:39,058;00:44:41,516;And what happens to your people?
600;00:44:41,517;00:44:45,266;You preserve your dignity
600;00:44:41,517;00:44:45,266;and die standing
601;00:44:45,267;00:44:47,682;and they'll sing
601;00:44:45,267;00:44:47,682;songs about you.
602;00:44:47,683;00:44:49,141;You'd rather burn than kneel.
603;00:44:49,142;00:44:50,808;The great hero.
604;00:44:53,642;00:44:56,516;Until winter comes and
604;00:44:53,642;00:44:56,516;the white walkers come for us all
605;00:44:56,517;00:44:59,183;and there's no one left to sing.
606;00:45:01,600;00:45:03,182;You're a good lad.
607;00:45:03,183;00:45:06,349;Truly you are.
608;00:45:06,350;00:45:11,391;But if you can't understand why I won't
608;00:45:06,350;00:45:11,391;enlist my people
609;00:45:11,392;00:45:14,141;in a foreigner's war,
610;00:45:14,142;00:45:16,142;there's no point explaining.
611;00:45:32,725;00:45:34,724;I think you're making
611;00:45:32,725;00:45:34,724;a terrible mistake.
612;00:45:36,558;00:45:39,099;The freedom to make
612;00:45:36,558;00:45:39,099;my own mistakes
613;00:45:39,100;00:45:40,767;was all I ever wanted.
614;00:46:50,475;00:46:54,099;Mance Rayder, you've been called
614;00:46:50,475;00:46:54,099;the King-beyond-the-Wall.
615;00:46:54,100;00:46:56,849;Westeros only has one king.
616;00:46:56,850;00:46:59,183;Bend the knee,
616;00:46:56,850;00:46:59,183;I promise you mercy.
617;00:47:12,725;00:47:14,850;Kneel and live.
618;00:47:22,225;00:47:26,017;This was my home for many years.
619;00:47:27,767;00:47:29,349;I wish you good fortune
620;00:47:29,350;00:47:32,017;in the wars to come.
621;00:48:13,392;00:48:16,432;We all must choose.
622;00:48:16,433;00:48:21,016;Man or woman, young or old,
623;00:48:21,017;00:48:24,432;lord or peasant,
623;00:48:21,017;00:48:24,432;our choices are the same.
624;00:48:24,433;00:48:27,932;We choose light
624;00:48:24,433;00:48:27,932;or we choose darkness.
625;00:48:27,933;00:48:30,974;We choose good
625;00:48:27,933;00:48:30,974;or we choose evil.
626;00:48:30,975;00:48:35,683;We choose the true god
626;00:48:30,975;00:48:35,683;or the false.
627;00:48:46,642;00:48:48,557;Free folk,
628;00:48:48,558;00:48:50,974;there is only one true king
629;00:48:50,975;00:48:54,099;and his name is Stannis.
630;00:48:54,100;00:48:56,557;Here stands your king of lies.
631;00:48:56,558;00:48:59,683;Behold the fate of those
631;00:48:56,558;00:48:59,683;who choose the darkness.
