130;00:11:41,500;00:11:44,709;coming right through her door.
131;00:11:44,710;00:11:47,169;She can lop them both off
131;00:11:44,710;00:11:47,169;as soon as she gets tired
132;00:11:47,170;00:11:50,039;of the clever words that
132;00:11:47,170;00:11:50,039;pour out their pieholes.
133;00:11:50,040;00:11:53,249;All thanks to Ser Bronn
133;00:11:50,040;00:11:53,249;of the fucking Blackwater.
134;00:11:53,250;00:11:56,540;If that's not
134;00:11:53,250;00:11:56,540;looking after myself,
134;00:11:53,250;00:11:56,540;I don't know what is.
135;00:11:58,250;00:11:59,580;It's good to see you again.
136;00:12:02,540;00:12:04,040;Yeah, you, too.
137;00:12:12,920;00:12:16,750;Anyone touches it,
137;00:12:12,920;00:12:16,750;I'll kill you first.
138;00:13:15,000;00:13:16,419;Come on, Pod.
139;00:13:16,420;00:13:17,919;Let's you and me go have a drink
140;00:13:17,920;00:13:19,460;while the fancy folks talk, eh?
141;00:13:48,670;00:13:50,499;I left this shit city
142;00:13:50,500;00:13:53,329;because I didn't
142;00:13:50,500;00:13:53,329;want to die in it.
143;00:13:53,330;00:13:55,620;Am I going to die
143;00:13:53,330;00:13:55,620;in this shit city?
144;00:13:56,710;00:13:57,789;You might.
145;00:13:57,790;00:14:01,209;And this is all your idea.
146;00:14:01,210;00:14:04,539;Seems every bad idea
146;00:14:01,210;00:14:04,539;has some Lannister cunt
146;00:14:01,210;00:14:04,539;behind it.
147;00:14:04,540;00:14:07,709;And some Clegane cunt
147;00:14:04,540;00:14:07,709;to help them see it through.

149;00:15:07,500;00:15:09,419;Remember me?
150;00:15:09,420;00:15:11,329;Yeah, you do.
151;00:15:11,330;00:15:15,419;You're even fucking
151;00:15:11,330;00:15:15,419;uglier than I am now.
152;00:15:15,420;00:15:17,920;What did they do to you?
153;00:15:19,210;00:15:21,249;Doesn't matter.
154;00:15:21,250;00:15:23,459;That's not how it ends
154;00:15:21,250;00:15:23,459;for you, brother.
155;00:15:23,460;00:15:26,709;You know who's coming for you.
156;00:15:26,710;00:15:28,790;You've always known.
157;00:15:43,330;00:15:44,330;Where is she?
158;00:15:45,750;00:15:46,869;She'll be here soon.
159;00:15:46,870;00:15:48,120;Didn't travel with you?
160;00:15:50,000;00:15:51,000;No.

165;00:17:45,920;00:17:47,919;We've been here for some time.
166;00:17:47,920;00:17:50,210;My apologies.
167;00:17:59,500;00:18:01,169;We are all
167;00:17:59,500;00:18:01,169;facing a unique--
168;00:18:01,170;00:18:03,209;Euron:
168;00:18:01,170;00:18:03,209;Theon!
169;00:18:03,210;00:18:05,119;I have your sister.
170;00:18:05,120;00:18:07,540;If you don't submit
170;00:18:05,120;00:18:07,540;to me here, now...
171;00:18:08,960;00:18:10,330;I'll kill her.
172;00:18:16,080;00:18:18,539;I think we ought to begin
172;00:18:16,080;00:18:18,539;with larger concerns.
173;00:18:18,540;00:18:20,749;Then why are you talking?
174;00:18:20,750;00:18:22,960;You're the smallest
174;00:18:20,750;00:18:22,960;concern here.
175;00:18:24,580;00:18:27,209;Do you remember
175;00:18:24,580;00:18:27,209;when we discussed
175;00:18:24,580;00:18:27,209;dwarf jokes?
176;00:18:27,210;00:18:28,959;His wasn't even good.
177;00:18:28,960;00:18:30,289;He explained it at the end.
178;00:18:30,290;00:18:31,829;Never explain.
178;00:18:30,290;00:18:31,829;It always ruins it.
179;00:18:31,830;00:18:33,329;We don't even let your kind live
180;00:18:33,330;00:18:36,539;in the Iron Islands, you know?
181;00:18:36,540;00:18:38,749;We kill you at birth.
182;00:18:38,750;00:18:40,789;An act of mercy for the parents.
183;00:18:40,790;00:18:43,459;Perhaps you ought to sit down.
184;00:18:43,460;00:18:44,919;Why?
185;00:18:44,920;00:18:47,120;Sit down or leave.
186;00:18:54,710;00:18:57,170;( laughing )
187;00:19:05,870;00:19:11,329;We are a group of people
187;00:19:05,870;00:19:11,329;who do not like one another,
188;00:19:11,330;00:19:13,870;as this recent
188;00:19:11,330;00:19:13,870;demonstration has shown.
189;00:19:15,370;00:19:17,669;We have suffered
189;00:19:15,370;00:19:17,669;at each other's hands.
190;00:19:17,670;00:19:21,039;We have lost people we love
190;00:19:17,670;00:19:21,039;at each other's hands.
191;00:19:21,040;00:19:23,329;If all we wanted
191;00:19:21,040;00:19:23,329;was more of the same,
192;00:19:23,330;00:19:25,579;there would be no need
192;00:19:23,330;00:19:25,579;for this gathering.
193;00:19:25,580;00:19:28,619;We are entirely capable
193;00:19:25,580;00:19:28,619;of waging war against
193;00:19:25,580;00:19:28,619;each other
194;00:19:28,620;00:19:30,329;without meeting
194;00:19:28,620;00:19:30,329;face-to-face.
195;00:19:30,330;00:19:32,209;So instead,
195;00:19:30,330;00:19:32,209;we should settle
195;00:19:30,330;00:19:32,209;our differences
196;00:19:32,210;00:19:34,869;and live together in harmony
196;00:19:32,210;00:19:34,869;for the rest of our days?
197;00:19:34,870;00:19:36,289;We all know
197;00:19:34,870;00:19:36,289;that will never happen.
198;00:19:36,290;00:19:37,670;Then why are we here?
199;00:19:40,000;00:19:43,040;This isn't about
199;00:19:40,000;00:19:43,040;living in harmony.
200;00:19:44,540;00:19:46,329;It's just about living.
201;00:19:46,330;00:19:48,919;The same thing
201;00:19:46,330;00:19:48,919;is coming for all of us.
202;00:19:48,920;00:19:50,959;A general you can't
202;00:19:48,920;00:19:50,959;negotiate with.
203;00:19:50,960;00:19:54,709;An army that doesn't
203;00:19:50,960;00:19:54,709;leave corpses behind
203;00:19:50,960;00:19:54,709;on the battlefield.
204;00:19:54,710;00:19:58,289;Lord Tyrion tells me
204;00:19:54,710;00:19:58,289;a million people live
204;00:19:54,710;00:19:58,289;in this city.
205;00:19:58,290;00:20:01,709;They're about to become
205;00:19:58,290;00:20:01,709;a million more soldiers
205;00:19:58,290;00:20:01,709;in the Army of the Dead.
206;00:20:01,710;00:20:04,420;I imagine for most of them
206;00:20:01,710;00:20:04,420;it would be an improvement.
207;00:20:08,580;00:20:10,000;This is serious.
208;00:20:11,460;00:20:13,169;I wouldn't be here
208;00:20:11,460;00:20:13,169;if it weren't.
209;00:20:13,170;00:20:14,999;I don't think
209;00:20:13,170;00:20:14,999;it's serious at all.
210;00:20:15,000;00:20:16,459;I think it's another bad joke.
211;00:20:16,460;00:20:19,209;If my brother Jaime
211;00:20:16,460;00:20:19,209;has informed me correctly,
212;00:20:19,210;00:20:20,829;you're asking me for a truce.
213;00:20:20,830;00:20:23,370;Yes.
213;00:20:20,830;00:20:23,370;That's all.
214;00:20:25,080;00:20:26,460;That's all?
215;00:20:27,830;00:20:29,419;Pull back my armies
215;00:20:27,830;00:20:29,419;and stand down
216;00:20:29,420;00:20:31,119;while you go
216;00:20:29,420;00:20:31,119;on your monster hunt.
217;00:20:31,120;00:20:33,709;Or while you solidify
217;00:20:31,120;00:20:33,709;and expand your position.
218;00:20:33,710;00:20:38,079;Hard for me
218;00:20:33,710;00:20:38,079;to know which it is
218;00:20:33,710;00:20:38,079;with my armies pulled back
219;00:20:38,080;00:20:41,749;until you return
219;00:20:38,080;00:20:41,749;and march on my capital
219;00:20:38,080;00:20:41,749;with four times the men.
220;00:20:41,750;00:20:46,080;Your capital will be safe
220;00:20:41,750;00:20:46,080;until the northern threat
220;00:20:41,750;00:20:46,080;is dealt with.

262;00:25:35,710;00:25:38,500;will have been for nothing.
263;00:25:40,250;00:25:42,040;The crown accepts your truce.
264;00:25:44,370;00:25:48,420;Until the dead are defeated,
264;00:25:44,370;00:25:48,420;they are the true enemy.
265;00:25:51,960;00:25:54,210;( sighs )
266;00:25:57,250;00:26:00,250;In return,
266;00:25:57,250;00:26:00,250;the King in the North
266;00:25:57,250;00:26:00,250;will extend this truce.
267;00:26:02,460;00:26:04,459;He will remain in the North
267;00:26:02,460;00:26:04,459;where he belongs.
268;00:26:04,460;00:26:06,369;He will not take up arms
268;00:26:04,460;00:26:06,369;against the Lannisters.
269;00:26:06,370;00:26:08,789;He will not choose sides.
270;00:26:08,790;00:26:11,079;Daenerys:
270;00:26:08,790;00:26:11,079;Just the King
270;00:26:08,790;00:26:11,079;in the North?
271;00:26:11,080;00:26:13,539;Not me?
271;00:26:11,080;00:26:13,539;( Cersei chuckles )
272;00:26:13,540;00:26:16,169;I would never ask it of you.
273;00:26:16,170;00:26:17,749;You would never agree to it.
274;00:26:17,750;00:26:20,250;And if you did,
274;00:26:17,750;00:26:20,250;I would trust you
274;00:26:17,750;00:26:20,250;even less than I do now.
275;00:26:21,580;00:26:24,499;I ask it only
275;00:26:21,580;00:26:24,499;of Ned Stark's son.
276;00:26:24,500;00:26:28,040;I know Ned Stark's son
276;00:26:24,500;00:26:28,040;will be true to his word.
277;00:26:42,290;00:26:44,999;I am true to my word.
278;00:26:45,000;00:26:46,750;Or I try to be.
279;00:26:49,870;00:26:52,460;That is why
279;00:26:49,870;00:26:52,460;I cannot give you
279;00:26:49,870;00:26:52,460;what you ask.
280;00:26:53,790;00:26:56,460;I cannot serve two queens.
281;00:26:58,830;00:27:00,249;And I have already
281;00:26:58,830;00:27:00,249;pledged myself
282;00:27:00,250;00:27:04,000;to Queen Daenerys
282;00:27:00,250;00:27:04,000;of House Targaryen.
283;00:27:15,120;00:27:17,709;Then there is
283;00:27:15,120;00:27:17,709;nothing left to discuss.
284;00:27:17,710;00:27:20,709;The dead will come north first.
284;00:27:17,710;00:27:20,709;Enjoy dealing with them.
285;00:27:20,710;00:27:22,710;We will deal with
285;00:27:20,710;00:27:22,710;whatever is left of you.
286;00:27:31,170;00:27:32,829;Brienne:
286;00:27:31,170;00:27:32,829;Ser Jaime.
287;00:27:32,830;00:27:34,289;It's been good to see you.
288;00:27:34,290;00:27:36,289;I imagine the next time
288;00:27:34,290;00:27:36,289;will be across a battlefield.
289;00:27:36,290;00:27:37,869;We both saw what just happened.
290;00:27:37,870;00:27:39,619;We both saw
290;00:27:37,870;00:27:39,619;that... thing.
291;00:27:39,620;00:27:42,419;Yes, and I'm not
291;00:27:39,620;00:27:42,419;looking forward to
291;00:27:39,620;00:27:42,419;seeing more of them.
292;00:27:42,420;00:27:44,079;But I'm loyal to the queen,
293;00:27:44,080;00:27:45,999;and you're loyal to Sansa
293;00:27:44,080;00:27:45,999;and her dolt brother.
294;00:27:46,000;00:27:48,119;Oh, fuck loyalty!
295;00:27:48,120;00:27:49,669;Fuck loyalty?
296;00:27:49,670;00:27:53,209;This goes beyond houses
296;00:27:49,670;00:27:53,209;and honor and oaths.
297;00:27:53,210;00:27:54,710;Talk to the queen.
298;00:28:00,330;00:28:01,710;And tell her what?
299;00:28:12,540;00:28:14,210;Davos:
299;00:28:12,540;00:28:14,210;I wish you hadn't
299;00:28:12,540;00:28:14,210;done that.
300;00:28:18,370;00:28:21,369;I'm grateful for your loyalty,
301;00:28:21,370;00:28:25,459;but my dragon died
301;00:28:21,370;00:28:25,459;so that we could be here.
302;00:28:25,460;00:28:27,869;If it's all for nothing,
303;00:28:27,870;00:28:30,039;then he died for nothing.
304;00:28:30,040;00:28:31,539;I know!
305;00:28:31,540;00:28:34,209;I'm pleased
305;00:28:31,540;00:28:34,209;you bent the knee
305;00:28:31,540;00:28:34,209;to our queen.
306;00:28:34,210;00:28:36,919;I would
306;00:28:34,210;00:28:36,919;have advised it,
306;00:28:34,210;00:28:36,919;had you asked.
307;00:28:36,920;00:28:38,869;But have you ever considered
308;00:28:38,870;00:28:41,079;learning how to lie
308;00:28:38,870;00:28:41,079;every now and then?
309;00:28:41,080;00:28:42,080;Just a bit?
310;00:28:43,620;00:28:46,460;I'm not going to swear
310;00:28:43,620;00:28:46,460;an oath I can't uphold.
311;00:28:47,830;00:28:49,419;Talk about my father
311;00:28:47,830;00:28:49,419;if you want,
312;00:28:49,420;00:28:52,499;tell me that's the attitude
312;00:28:49,420;00:28:52,499;that got him killed.
313;00:28:52,500;00:28:55,579;But when enough people
313;00:28:52,500;00:28:55,579;make false promises,
314;00:28:55,580;00:28:58,749;words stop meaning anything.
315;00:28:58,750;00:29:01,919;Then there
315;00:28:58,750;00:29:01,919;are no more answers,
315;00:28:58,750;00:29:01,919;only better and better lies.
316;00:29:01,920;00:29:04,669;And lies won't help us
316;00:29:01,920;00:29:04,669;in this fight.
317;00:29:04,670;00:29:06,749;Tyrion:
317;00:29:04,670;00:29:06,749;That is indeed a problem.
318;00:29:06,750;00:29:10,290;The more immediate problem
318;00:29:06,750;00:29:10,290;is that we're fucked.
319;00:29:11,500;00:29:12,919;Any ideas as to how we might
320;00:29:12,920;00:29:14,920;change that state of affairs?
321;00:29:16,290;00:29:17,749;Only one.
322;00:29:17,750;00:29:20,169;Everyone stays here,
323;00:29:20,170;00:29:22,959;and I go and talk to my sister.
324;00:29:22,960;00:29:27,369;I didn't come all this way
324;00:29:22,960;00:29:27,369;to have my Hand murdered.
325;00:29:27,370;00:29:29,169;I don't want Cersei
325;00:29:27,370;00:29:29,169;to murder me either.
326;00:29:29,170;00:29:32,169;I could have stayed in my cell
326;00:29:29,170;00:29:32,169;and saved a great deal
326;00:29:29,170;00:29:32,169;of trouble.
327;00:29:32,170;00:29:34,209;Jon:
327;00:29:32,170;00:29:34,209;I did this.
328;00:29:34,210;00:29:36,709;I should go.
328;00:29:34,210;00:29:36,709;She'll definitely
328;00:29:34,210;00:29:36,709;murder you.
329;00:29:36,710;00:29:40,080;I go see my sister alone.
330;00:29:41,580;00:29:43,079;Or we all go home
331;00:29:43,080;00:29:44,830;and we're right back
331;00:29:43,080;00:29:44,830;where we started.
332;00:30:46,710;00:30:51,039;You spoke with her?
332;00:30:46,710;00:30:51,039;At her until she
332;00:30:46,710;00:30:51,039;kicked me out.
333;00:30:51,040;00:30:54,119;She thinks
333;00:30:51,040;00:30:54,119;I was an idiot
333;00:30:51,040;00:30:54,119;to trust you.
334;00:30:54,120;00:30:56,249;A lot of people
334;00:30:54,120;00:30:56,249;seem to think that,
334;00:30:54,120;00:30:56,249;actually.
335;00:30:56,250;00:30:57,869;I'm about to step into a room
336;00:30:57,870;00:30:59,669;with the most murderous
336;00:30:57,870;00:30:59,669;woman in the world
337;00:30:59,670;00:31:03,579;who's already tried
337;00:30:59,670;00:31:03,579;to kill me twice,
337;00:30:59,670;00:31:03,579;that I know of.
338;00:31:03,580;00:31:05,210;Who's an idiot?
339;00:31:08,620;00:31:11,079;I suppose we should say goodbye,
340;00:31:11,080;00:31:12,670;one idiot to another.
341;00:32:11,620;00:32:13,499;I shouldn't
341;00:32:11,620;00:32:13,499;be surprised,
341;00:32:11,620;00:32:13,499;I suppose.
342;00:32:13,500;00:32:15,289;She's your kind
342;00:32:13,500;00:32:15,289;of woman--
343;00:32:15,290;00:32:17,829;a foreign whore
343;00:32:15,290;00:32:17,829;who doesn't know
343;00:32:15,290;00:32:17,829;her place.
344;00:32:17,830;00:32:21,619;A foreign whore
344;00:32:17,830;00:32:21,619;you can't abduct,
344;00:32:17,830;00:32:21,619;beat, or intimidate.
345;00:32:21,620;00:32:23,329;That must be difficult for you.
346;00:32:23,330;00:32:25,789;So you bring her here
346;00:32:23,330;00:32:25,789;with her pet Northerner,
347;00:32:25,790;00:32:27,709;whom you've convinced
347;00:32:25,790;00:32:27,709;to bow down before her.
347;00:32:25,790;00:32:27,709;I didn't know about that.
348;00:32:27,710;00:32:29,789;And now you've got them both
348;00:32:27,710;00:32:29,789;working towards the same goal,
349;00:32:29,790;00:32:31,919;the goal
349;00:32:29,790;00:32:31,919;you've worked towards
349;00:32:29,790;00:32:31,919;your entire life...
350;00:32:31,920;00:32:34,999;Cersei, I didn't know.
350;00:32:31,920;00:32:34,999;...the destruction
350;00:32:31,920;00:32:34,999;of this family.
351;00:32:35,000;00:32:38,329;I am the one
351;00:32:35,000;00:32:38,329;preventing that
351;00:32:35,000;00:32:38,329;from happening.
352;00:32:38,330;00:32:40,869;Daenerys didn't want
352;00:32:38,330;00:32:40,869;to debate and negotiate.
353;00:32:40,870;00:32:42,329;She didn't want
353;00:32:40,870;00:32:42,329;to bring you words.
354;00:32:42,330;00:32:44,289;She wanted to bring you
354;00:32:42,330;00:32:44,289;fire and blood
355;00:32:44,290;00:32:46,419;until I advised her otherwise.
356;00:32:46,420;00:32:48,209;I don't want
356;00:32:46,420;00:32:48,209;to destroy our family.
357;00:32:48,210;00:32:50,169;I never have.
358;00:32:50,170;00:32:51,619;You killed our father.
359;00:32:51,620;00:32:53,249;After he sentenced me to death
360;00:32:53,250;00:32:55,829;for a crime
360;00:32:53,250;00:32:55,829;I didn't commit,
360;00:32:53,250;00:32:55,829;yes, I killed him.
361;00:32:55,830;00:32:57,499;Hate me for it if you want.
362;00:32:57,500;00:32:59,829;I hate myself for it
362;00:32:57,500;00:32:59,829;in spite of what he was,
363;00:32:59,830;00:33:02,289;in spite of what he did to me.
364;00:33:02,290;00:33:04,039;Oh, poor little man.
365;00:33:04,040;00:33:05,749;Your papa was mean to you.
366;00:33:05,750;00:33:09,789;Do you have any idea
366;00:33:05,750;00:33:09,789;what you did when you
366;00:33:05,750;00:33:09,789;fired that crossbow?
367;00:33:09,790;00:33:11,619;You left us open.
368;00:33:11,620;00:33:13,209;You laid us bare
368;00:33:11,620;00:33:13,209;for the vultures,
369;00:33:13,210;00:33:16,749;and the vultures came
369;00:33:13,210;00:33:16,749;and tore us apart.
370;00:33:16,750;00:33:18,419;You may not have killed Joffrey,
371;00:33:18,420;00:33:20,329;but you killed Myrcella,
371;00:33:18,420;00:33:20,329;you killed Tommen.
372;00:33:20,330;00:33:22,369;No one would've touched them
372;00:33:20,330;00:33:22,369;if Father was here.
373;00:33:22,370;00:33:24,959;No one would have dared--
373;00:33:22,370;00:33:24,959;I have never been more sorry
373;00:33:22,370;00:33:24,959;about anything.
374;00:33:24,960;00:33:26,669;I will not hear it,
374;00:33:24,960;00:33:26,669;not from you.
375;00:33:26,670;00:33:28,420;I will not hear it!
376;00:33:31,370;00:33:33,709;All right.
377;00:33:33,710;00:33:35,169;You love your family,
378;00:33:35,170;00:33:38,249;and I have destroyed it.
379;00:33:38,250;00:33:40,999;I will always be a threat.
380;00:33:41,000;00:33:42,330;So put an end to me.

381;00:33:51,170;00:33:53,369;you'd have a mother.

382;00:33:53,370;00:33:56,119;you'd have a father.

384;00:33:57,460;00:33:59,539;you'd have
384;00:33:57,460;00:33:59,539;two beautiful children.
385;00:33:59,540;00:34:01,709;I've thought about killing you

387;00:34:05,080;00:34:07,370;Do it!
387;00:34:05,080;00:34:07,370;Say the word.

390;00:35:16,170;00:35:19,289;about the children
390;00:35:16,170;00:35:19,289;than you could ever know.
391;00:35:19,290;00:35:22,459;I will not--
391;00:35:19,290;00:35:22,459;I don't care.
391;00:35:19,290;00:35:22,459;I loved them.
392;00:35:22,460;00:35:24,329;You know I did.
393;00:35:24,330;00:35:27,830;You know it in your heart
393;00:35:24,330;00:35:27,830;if there's anything
393;00:35:24,330;00:35:27,830;left of it.
394;00:35:29,960;00:35:31,670;It doesn't matter.
395;00:35:33,620;00:35:37,249;Your love doesn't matter.
395;00:35:33,620;00:35:37,249;Your feelings don't matter.
396;00:35:37,250;00:35:39,419;I don't care
396;00:35:37,250;00:35:39,419;why you did what you did.
397;00:35:39,420;00:35:42,289;I only care what it cost us.
398;00:35:42,290;00:35:43,670;It cost us our future.
399;00:35:45,330;00:35:47,459;If there's no future,
399;00:35:45,330;00:35:47,459;then why are we here?
400;00:35:47,460;00:35:49,459;Why did you allow me to come?
401;00:35:49,460;00:35:52,499;Not to help my enemies
401;00:35:49,460;00:35:52,499;collaborate in my destruction.
402;00:35:52,500;00:35:54,249;Yes, no, not what you hoped for,
403;00:35:54,250;00:35:56,790;but you must have
403;00:35:54,250;00:35:56,790;hoped for something.
404;00:35:57,830;00:36:00,369;What did you hope for?
405;00:36:00,370;00:36:04,039;To make Jon Snow
405;00:36:00,370;00:36:04,039;submit to your queen?
405;00:36:00,370;00:36:04,039;Mm, not like this.
406;00:36:04,040;00:36:06,419;But eventually,
406;00:36:04,040;00:36:06,419;you want everyone
406;00:36:04,040;00:36:06,419;to bend the knee to her.
407;00:36:06,420;00:36:08,169;Yes.
407;00:36:06,420;00:36:08,169;Why?
408;00:36:08,170;00:36:09,749;Because I think
409;00:36:09,750;00:36:11,579;she will make the world
409;00:36:09,750;00:36:11,579;a better place.
410;00:36:11,580;00:36:13,500;You said she'd destroy
410;00:36:11,580;00:36:13,500;King's Landing.
411;00:36:15,710;00:36:17,619;She knows herself.
412;00:36:17,620;00:36:19,169;She chose an advisor
413;00:36:19,170;00:36:22,499;who would check
413;00:36:19,170;00:36:22,499;her worst impulses
413;00:36:19,170;00:36:22,499;instead of feeding them.
414;00:36:22,500;00:36:24,499;That's the difference
414;00:36:22,500;00:36:24,499;between you.
415;00:36:24,500;00:36:26,709;I don't care about
415;00:36:24,500;00:36:26,709;checking my worst impulses.
416;00:36:26,710;00:36:29,329;I don't care about
416;00:36:26,710;00:36:29,329;making the world

417;00:36:29,330;00:36:31,119;Hang the world.
418;00:36:31,120;00:36:33,579;That thing you dragged here,
419;00:36:33,580;00:36:37,039;I know what it is,
419;00:36:33,580;00:36:37,039;I know what it means.
420;00:36:37,040;00:36:39,249;And when it came at me,
420;00:36:37,040;00:36:39,249;I didn't think about
420;00:36:37,040;00:36:39,249;the world.
421;00:36:39,250;00:36:41,329;Not at all.
422;00:36:41,330;00:36:42,919;As soon as it opened its mouth,
423;00:36:42,920;00:36:44,289;the world disappeared for me,
424;00:36:44,290;00:36:46,419;right down its black throat.

425;00:36:46,420;00:36:48,789;was keeping those

426;00:36:48,790;00:36:50,329;away from the ones

427;00:36:50,330;00:36:52,119;away from my family.
428;00:36:52,120;00:36:55,749;Maybe Euron Greyjoy
428;00:36:52,120;00:36:55,749;had the right idea.

433;00:37:34,870;00:37:36,290;I know.
434;00:37:38,960;00:37:41,459;I respect what you did.
435;00:37:41,460;00:37:43,790;Wish you hadn't done it,
435;00:37:41,460;00:37:43,790;but I respect it.
436;00:37:54,460;00:37:57,960;This place was the beginning
436;00:37:54,460;00:37:57,960;of the end for my family.

440;00:38:11,580;00:38:13,290;Extraordinary.
441;00:38:14,710;00:38:17,749;They filled people

442;00:38:17,750;00:38:20,000;and we locked them in here.
443;00:38:21,290;00:38:22,830;They wasted away.
444;00:38:24,040;00:38:26,329;They grew small.
445;00:38:26,330;00:38:28,960;And we grew small as well.

505;00:42:53,920;00:42:57,079;I believe.
506;00:42:57,080;00:42:59,709;I never trust godly men.
507;00:42:59,710;00:43:01,209;They're killers.
508;00:43:01,210;00:43:03,080;And Arya was one of them.
509;00:43:07,960;00:43:09,539;What do you think she's after?
510;00:43:09,540;00:43:12,119;She's your sister.
511;00:43:12,120;00:43:14,250;You know her far better
511;00:43:12,120;00:43:14,250;than I ever could.
512;00:43:17,790;00:43:22,539;Sometimes
512;00:43:17,790;00:43:22,539;when I try to understand
512;00:43:17,790;00:43:22,539;a person's motives,
513;00:43:22,540;00:43:24,460;I play a little game.
514;00:43:26,960;00:43:28,960;I assume the worst.
515;00:43:31,960;00:43:34,789;What's the worst reason
515;00:43:31,960;00:43:34,789;they could possibly have
516;00:43:34,790;00:43:39,749;for saying what they say
516;00:43:34,790;00:43:39,749;and doing what they do?
517;00:43:39,750;00:43:41,959;Then I ask myself,
518;00:43:41,960;00:43:45,119;How well does
518;00:43:41,960;00:43:45,119;that reason explain
519;00:43:45,120;00:43:48,080;what they say
519;00:43:45,120;00:43:48,080;and what they do?
520;00:43:49,920;00:43:51,459;So, tell me--
521;00:43:51,460;00:43:54,000;what's the worst thing
521;00:43:51,460;00:43:54,000;she could want?
522;00:43:58,830;00:44:01,829;She could want me dead
523;00:44:01,830;00:44:05,039;because she thinks
523;00:44:01,830;00:44:05,039;I wronged my family.
524;00:44:05,040;00:44:07,330;Why did she come to Winterfell?
525;00:44:10,540;00:44:12,499;To kill me
526;00:44:12,500;00:44:16,329;for marrying our enemies
526;00:44:12,500;00:44:16,329;and betraying my family.
527;00:44:16,330;00:44:19,330;Why did
527;00:44:16,330;00:44:19,330;she unearth the letter
527;00:44:16,330;00:44:19,330;Cersei made you write?
528;00:44:22,040;00:44:26,119;To provide proof
528;00:44:22,040;00:44:26,119;of my betrayals.

529;00:44:26,120;00:44:30,869;after she murders me.
530;00:44:30,870;00:44:34,539;And after she murders you,
531;00:44:34,540;00:44:37,210;what does she become?
532;00:44:42,710;00:44:44,420;Lady of Winterfell.
533;00:44:56,580;00:44:59,459;( waves crashing )
534;00:44:59,460;00:45:02,369;If we have the Dothraki
534;00:44:59,460;00:45:02,369;ride hard on the kingsroad,
535;00:45:02,370;00:45:05,039;they'll arrive at Winterfell
535;00:45:02,370;00:45:05,039;within the fortnight.
536;00:45:05,040;00:45:06,539;And the Unsullied?
537;00:45:06,540;00:45:08,169;We can sail with them
537;00:45:06,540;00:45:08,169;to White Harbor,
538;00:45:08,170;00:45:10,869;meet the Dothraki here
538;00:45:08,170;00:45:10,869;on the kingsroad,
539;00:45:10,870;00:45:13,829;then ride together
539;00:45:10,870;00:45:13,829;to Winterfell.
540;00:45:13,830;00:45:17,079;Perhaps you should fly
540;00:45:13,830;00:45:17,079;to Winterfell, Your Grace.
541;00:45:17,080;00:45:19,579;You have many enemies
541;00:45:17,080;00:45:19,579;in the North.
542;00:45:19,580;00:45:21,829;Thousands fell
542;00:45:19,580;00:45:21,829;fighting your father.
543;00:45:21,830;00:45:25,539;All it takes
543;00:45:21,830;00:45:25,539;is one angry man
543;00:45:21,830;00:45:25,539;with a crossbow.
544;00:45:25,540;00:45:27,749;He'll see
544;00:45:25,540;00:45:27,749;your silver hair
544;00:45:25,540;00:45:27,749;on the kingsroad
545;00:45:27,750;00:45:30,789;and know that
545;00:45:27,750;00:45:30,789;one well-placed bolt
545;00:45:27,750;00:45:30,789;will make him a hero.
546;00:45:30,790;00:45:33,420;The man who killed
546;00:45:30,790;00:45:33,420;the conqueror.
547;00:45:34,960;00:45:36,749;Jon:
547;00:45:34,960;00:45:36,749;It's your decision,
547;00:45:34,960;00:45:36,749;Your Grace.
548;00:45:36,750;00:45:39,959;But if we're going to be
548;00:45:36,750;00:45:39,959;allies in this war,
549;00:45:39,960;00:45:44,039;it's important
549;00:45:39,960;00:45:44,039;for the Northerners
549;00:45:39,960;00:45:44,039;to see us as allies.
550;00:45:44,040;00:45:47,209;If we sail
550;00:45:44,040;00:45:47,209;to White Harbor together,
551;00:45:47,210;00:45:49,460;I think it sends
551;00:45:47,210;00:45:49,460;a better message.
552;00:45:55,920;00:45:58,669;I've not come
552;00:45:55,920;00:45:58,669;to conquer the North.
553;00:45:58,670;00:46:01,000;I'm coming to save the North.
554;00:46:06,620;00:46:07,960;We sail together.
555;00:46:23,120;00:46:24,120;Jon.
556;00:46:26,290;00:46:27,620;Can I speak with you?
557;00:46:30,960;00:46:32,080;All right.
558;00:46:37,960;00:46:40,539;What you did in King's Landing,
559;00:46:40,540;00:46:42,670;what you said...
560;00:46:44,830;00:46:48,249;you could've lied to Cersei
561;00:46:48,250;00:46:51,170;about bending the knee
561;00:46:48,250;00:46:51,170;to Daenerys.
562;00:46:55,170;00:46:57,620;You risked everything
562;00:46:55,170;00:46:57,620;to tell an enemy the truth.
563;00:46:59,540;00:47:01,999;We went down there
563;00:46:59,540;00:47:01,999;to make peace.
564;00:47:02,000;00:47:05,499;And it seems to me
564;00:47:02,000;00:47:05,499;we need to be honest
564;00:47:02,000;00:47:05,499;with each other
565;00:47:05,500;00:47:06,870;if we're going
565;00:47:05,500;00:47:06,870;to fight together.
566;00:47:08,420;00:47:10,870;You've always known
566;00:47:08,420;00:47:10,870;what was right.
567;00:47:14,370;00:47:17,669;Even when we were all
567;00:47:14,370;00:47:17,669;young and stupid,
568;00:47:17,670;00:47:19,169;you always knew.
569;00:47:19,170;00:47:21,420;Every step you take...
570;00:47:22,870;00:47:24,749;it's always the right step.
571;00:47:24,750;00:47:25,869;It's not.
572;00:47:25,870;00:47:28,119;It may seem that way
572;00:47:25,870;00:47:28,119;from the outside,
573;00:47:28,120;00:47:31,540;but I promise you,
573;00:47:28,120;00:47:31,540;it's not true.
574;00:47:33,960;00:47:36,539;I've done
574;00:47:33,960;00:47:36,539;plenty of things
574;00:47:33,960;00:47:36,539;that I regret.
575;00:47:36,540;00:47:38,249;Not compared to me, you haven't.
576;00:47:38,250;00:47:39,870;No.
577;00:47:41,710;00:47:43,500;Not compared to you.
578;00:47:54,750;00:47:57,370;I always wanted
578;00:47:54,750;00:47:57,370;to do the right thing.
579;00:48:00,040;00:48:02,119;Be the right kind of person.
580;00:48:02,120;00:48:04,710;But I never knew
580;00:48:02,120;00:48:04,710;what that meant.
581;00:48:06,120;00:48:08,460;It always seemed like there's...
582;00:48:12,540;00:48:14,960;like there was
582;00:48:12,540;00:48:14,960;an impossible choice
582;00:48:12,540;00:48:14,960;I had to make.
583;00:48:17,420;00:48:19,210;Stark or Greyjoy.
584;00:48:22,460;00:48:27,079;Our father was
584;00:48:22,460;00:48:27,079;more of a father to you
584;00:48:22,460;00:48:27,079;than yours ever was.
585;00:48:27,080;00:48:29,919;He was.
585;00:48:27,080;00:48:29,919;And you betrayed him.
586;00:48:29,920;00:48:31,789;Betrayed his memory.
587;00:48:31,790;00:48:32,790;I did.
588;00:48:36,120;00:48:37,789;( sighs )
589;00:48:37,790;00:48:39,540;But you never lost him.
590;00:48:43,420;00:48:45,500;He's a part of you.
591;00:48:47,040;00:48:48,789;Just like he's a part of me.
592;00:48:48,790;00:48:50,960;But the things I've done...
593;00:48:52,670;00:48:55,420;It's not my place
593;00:48:52,670;00:48:55,420;to forgive you
593;00:48:52,670;00:48:55,420;for all of it.
594;00:48:58,790;00:49:01,999;But what I can forgive,
595;00:49:02,000;00:49:03,420;I do.
596;00:49:09,790;00:49:11,960;You don't need to choose.
597;00:49:13,290;00:49:15,250;You're a Greyjoy...
598;00:49:17,460;00:49:18,790;and you're a Stark.

605;00:49:54,210;00:49:57,000;still talking to me?

610;00:50:37,830;00:50:41,669;We left

617;00:51:00,250;00:51:01,750;I did.
618;00:51:04,120;00:51:06,999;I ran from my uncle.
619;00:51:07,000;00:51:08,419;I was a coward.

620;00:51:08,420;00:51:11,669;should we listen to you?

651;00:54:53,500;00:54:55,960;Have my sister brought

652;00:55:41,420;00:55:43,210;you want to do this?
653;00:55:46,040;00:55:49,289;It's not what I want.
653;00:55:46,040;00:55:49,289;It's what honor demands.
654;00:55:49,290;00:55:52,209;And what does honor demand?
655;00:55:52,210;00:55:55,079;That I defend my family
655;00:55:52,210;00:55:55,079;from those who would harm us.
656;00:55:55,080;00:55:58,710;That I defend the North

656;00:55:55,080;00:55:58,710;betray us.
657;00:56:00,960;00:56:02,670;All right, then.
658;00:56:04,080;00:56:05,370;Get on with it.
659;00:56:08,210;00:56:10,369;You stand accused of murder.
660;00:56:10,370;00:56:13,209;You stand accused of treason.
661;00:56:13,210;00:56:16,000;How do you answer
661;00:56:13,210;00:56:16,000;these charges...
662;00:56:18,420;00:56:20,250;Lord Baelish?
663;00:56:36,000;00:56:37,540;My sister asked you a question.
664;00:56:42,250;00:56:43,750;Lady Sansa, forgive me...
665;00:56:45,420;00:56:47,209;I'm a bit confused.
666;00:56:47,210;00:56:49,499;Which charges confuse you?
667;00:56:49,500;00:56:51,539;Let's start with
667;00:56:49,500;00:56:51,539;the simplest one--
668;00:56:51,540;00:56:54,119;you murdered our aunt,
668;00:56:51,540;00:56:54,119;Lysa Arryn.
669;00:56:54,120;00:56:56,999;You pushed her
669;00:56:54,120;00:56:56,999;through the Moon Door
669;00:56:54,120;00:56:56,999;and watched her fall.
670;00:56:57,000;00:56:58,870;Do you deny it?
671;00:57:00,920;00:57:02,419;I did it to protect you.
672;00:57:02,420;00:57:04,459;You did it
672;00:57:02,420;00:57:04,459;to take power
672;00:57:02,420;00:57:04,459;in the Vale.
673;00:57:04,460;00:57:07,749;Earlier, you conspired
673;00:57:04,460;00:57:07,749;to murder Jon Arryn.
674;00:57:07,750;00:57:10,249;You gave Lysa Tears of Lys
674;00:57:07,750;00:57:10,249;to poison him.
675;00:57:10,250;00:57:11,290;Do you deny it?
676;00:57:13,620;00:57:16,789;Whatever your aunt
676;00:57:13,620;00:57:16,789;might have told you...
677;00:57:16,790;00:57:19,120;she was a troubled woman.
678;00:57:20,460;00:57:21,749;She imagined enemies everywhere.
679;00:57:21,750;00:57:24,119;You had Aunt Lysa send
679;00:57:21,750;00:57:24,119;a letter to our parents
680;00:57:24,120;00:57:26,619;telling them
680;00:57:24,120;00:57:26,619;it was the Lannisters
680;00:57:24,120;00:57:26,619;who murdered Jon Arryn
681;00:57:26,620;00:57:28,119;when, really, it was you.
682;00:57:28,120;00:57:30,329;The conflict between
682;00:57:28,120;00:57:30,329;the Starks and the Lannisters,
683;00:57:30,330;00:57:31,829;it was you who started it.
684;00:57:31,830;00:57:32,919;Do you deny it?
685;00:57:32,920;00:57:34,539;I know of no such letter.
686;00:57:34,540;00:57:36,369;You conspired
686;00:57:34,540;00:57:36,369;with Cersei Lannister
687;00:57:36,370;00:57:40,079;and Joffrey Baratheon
687;00:57:36,370;00:57:40,079;to betray our father,
687;00:57:36,370;00:57:40,079;Ned Stark.
688;00:57:40,080;00:57:42,619;Thanks to your treachery,
688;00:57:40,080;00:57:42,619;he was imprisoned
689;00:57:42,620;00:57:46,079;and later executed
689;00:57:42,620;00:57:46,079;on false charges
689;00:57:42,620;00:57:46,079;of treason.
690;00:57:46,080;00:57:48,919;Do you deny it?
690;00:57:46,080;00:57:48,919;I deny it!
691;00:57:48,920;00:57:52,289;None of you were there
691;00:57:48,920;00:57:52,289;to see what happened.
692;00:57:52,290;00:57:54,249;None of you knows the truth.
693;00:57:54,250;00:57:56,170;You held a knife to his throat.
694;00:58:01,370;00:58:04,000;You said,
694;00:58:01,370;00:58:04,000;I did warn you
694;00:58:01,370;00:58:04,000;not the trust me.
695;00:58:07,330;00:58:12,000;You told our mother
695;00:58:07,330;00:58:12,000;this knife belonged
695;00:58:07,330;00:58:12,000;to Tyrion Lannister.
696;00:58:13,330;00:58:15,209;But that was another
696;00:58:13,330;00:58:15,209;one of your lies.
697;00:58:15,210;00:58:17,040;It was yours.
698;00:58:22,170;00:58:25,079;Lady Sansa,
698;00:58:22,170;00:58:25,079;I have known you
698;00:58:22,170;00:58:25,079;since you were a girl.
699;00:58:25,080;00:58:27,749;I've protected you.
699;00:58:25,080;00:58:27,749;Protected me?
700;00:58:27,750;00:58:29,870;By selling me to the Boltons?
701;00:58:31,210;00:58:33,539;If we could speak alone,
702;00:58:33,540;00:58:35,080;I can explain everything.
703;00:58:37,290;00:58:40,419;Sometimes when
703;00:58:37,290;00:58:40,419;I'm trying to understand
703;00:58:37,290;00:58:40,419;a person's motives,
704;00:58:40,420;00:58:42,999;I play a little game.
705;00:58:43,000;00:58:44,670;I assume the worst.
706;00:58:46,040;00:58:47,959;What's the worst reason you have
707;00:58:47,960;00:58:49,870;for turning me
707;00:58:47,960;00:58:49,870;against my sister?
708;00:58:51,710;00:58:53,789;That's what you do, isn't it?
709;00:58:53,790;00:58:55,619;That's what
709;00:58:53,790;00:58:55,619;you've always done--
710;00:58:55,620;00:58:57,459;turn family against family,
711;00:58:57,460;00:58:59,369;turn sister against sister.
712;00:58:59,370;00:59:01,579;That's what you did
712;00:58:59,370;00:59:01,579;to our mother and Aunt Lysa,
713;00:59:01,580;00:59:03,789;and that's what
713;00:59:01,580;00:59:03,789;you tried to do to us.
714;00:59:03,790;00:59:05,119;Sansa, please.
715;00:59:05,120;00:59:08,959;I'm a slow learner, it's true.
716;00:59:08,960;00:59:10,419;But I learn.
717;00:59:10,420;00:59:12,669;Give me a chance
717;00:59:10,420;00:59:12,669;to defend myself.
718;00:59:12,670;00:59:13,960;I deserve that.
719;00:59:19,790;00:59:21,369;I am Lord Protector of the Vale
720;00:59:21,370;00:59:23,749;and I command you
720;00:59:21,370;00:59:23,749;to escort me safely
720;00:59:21,370;00:59:23,749;back to the Eyrie.
721;00:59:23,750;00:59:25,040;I think not.
722;00:59:28,330;00:59:31,040;Sansa, I beg you!
723;00:59:32,540;00:59:34,579;I loved your mother
723;00:59:32,540;00:59:34,579;since the time
723;00:59:32,540;00:59:34,579;I was a boy.
724;00:59:34,580;00:59:36,370;And yet, you betrayed her.
725;00:59:38,420;00:59:41,579;I loved you.
726;00:59:41,580;00:59:43,210;More than anyone.
727;00:59:44,330;00:59:46,120;And yet, you betrayed me.
728;00:59:48,750;00:59:50,499;When you brought me
728;00:59:48,750;00:59:50,499;back to Winterfell,
729;00:59:50,500;00:59:53,039;you told me
729;00:59:50,500;00:59:53,039;there's no justice
729;00:59:50,500;00:59:53,039;in the world,
730;00:59:53,040;00:59:55,250;not unless we make it.
731;00:59:57,250;01:00:01,669;Thank you for all
731;00:59:57,250;01:00:01,669;your many lessons,

739;01:00:44,370;01:00:45,709;just to gather supplies
739;01:00:44,370;01:00:45,709;for the train.
740;01:00:45,710;01:00:47,249;Jaime:

760;01:01:33,170;01:01:36,749;to fight beside foreign scum,
761;01:01:36,750;01:01:38,249;to fight for the Dragon Queen?
762;01:01:38,250;01:01:40,169;You saw it with your own eyes.
763;01:01:40,170;01:01:42,539;You saw a dead man
763;01:01:40,170;01:01:42,539;trying to kill us.
764;01:01:42,540;01:01:44,369;I saw it burn.
765;01:01:44,370;01:01:46,209;If dragons can't stop them,
766;01:01:46,210;01:01:49,249;if Dothraki and Unsullied
766;01:01:46,210;01:01:49,249;and Northmen can't stop them,
767;01:01:49,250;01:01:51,249;how will our armies
767;01:01:49,250;01:01:51,249;make a difference?
768;01:01:51,250;01:01:53,249;This isn't about noble houses,
769;01:01:53,250;01:01:55,369;this is about
769;01:01:53,250;01:01:55,369;the living and the dead!
770;01:01:55,370;01:01:57,419;And I intend to stay
770;01:01:55,370;01:01:57,419;amongst the living.
771;01:01:57,420;01:02:00,619;Let the Stark boy
771;01:01:57,420;01:02:00,619;and his new queen
771;01:01:57,420;01:02:00,619;defend the North.
772;01:02:00,620;01:02:02,829;We stay here
772;01:02:00,620;01:02:02,829;where we've always been.
773;01:02:02,830;01:02:05,370;I made a promise.
774;01:02:07,540;01:02:10,959;Our child will rule Westeros.
775;01:02:10,960;01:02:15,829;Our child will never be born
775;01:02:10,960;01:02:15,829;if the dead come south.
776;01:02:15,830;01:02:17,419;The monsters are real.
777;01:02:17,420;01:02:19,539;The white walkers,
778;01:02:19,540;01:02:21,789;the dragons,
778;01:02:19,540;01:02:21,789;the Dothraki screamers--
779;01:02:21,790;01:02:25,789;all the frightening stories
779;01:02:21,790;01:02:25,789;we heard when we were young,
779;01:02:21,790;01:02:25,789;they're all real.
780;01:02:25,790;01:02:27,499;So be it.
781;01:02:27,500;01:02:29,619;Let the monsters
781;01:02:27,500;01:02:29,619;kill each other.
782;01:02:29,620;01:02:31,869;And while they battle
782;01:02:29,620;01:02:31,869;in the North,
783;01:02:31,870;01:02:34,289;we take back the lands
783;01:02:31,870;01:02:34,289;that belong to us.
784;01:02:34,290;01:02:37,079;And then what?
784;01:02:34,290;01:02:37,079;And then we rule.
785;01:02:37,080;01:02:39,999;When the fighting
785;01:02:37,080;01:02:39,999;in the North is over,
785;01:02:37,080;01:02:39,999;someone wins.
786;01:02:40,000;01:02:42,169;You understand that, don't you?
787;01:02:42,170;01:02:45,669;If the dead win,
787;01:02:42,170;01:02:45,669;they march south
787;01:02:42,170;01:02:45,669;and kill us all.
788;01:02:45,670;01:02:48,749;If the living win,
788;01:02:45,670;01:02:48,749;and we've betrayed them,
789;01:02:48,750;01:02:50,709;they march south
789;01:02:48,750;01:02:50,709;and kill us all!
790;01:02:50,710;01:02:53,709;The Targaryens and the Starks
790;01:02:50,710;01:02:53,709;already want to kill us all.
791;01:02:53,710;01:02:55,119;Most of them
791;01:02:53,710;01:02:55,119;will die in the North.
792;01:02:55,120;01:02:56,709;I faced them in the field.
793;01:02:56,710;01:02:59,249;We can't beat them.
793;01:02:56,710;01:02:59,249;We can't beat their dragons.
794;01:02:59,250;01:03:00,789;How many dragons
794;01:02:59,250;01:03:00,789;did you see at the pit?
795;01:03:00,790;01:03:02,789;Two.
795;01:03:00,790;01:03:02,789;What happened
795;01:03:00,790;01:03:02,789;to the third?
796;01:03:02,790;01:03:05,289;For all we know,
796;01:03:02,790;01:03:05,289;it's guarding her fleet!
797;01:03:05,290;01:03:08,619;She came here
797;01:03:05,290;01:03:08,619;with her dragons and her
797;01:03:05,290;01:03:08,619;Dothraki and her Unsullied.
798;01:03:08,620;01:03:11,419;She came here to show us
798;01:03:08,620;01:03:11,419;all her power.
799;01:03:11,420;01:03:14,459;No, something happened.
799;01:03:11,420;01:03:14,459;The dragons are vulnerable.
800;01:03:14,460;01:03:16,999;We can't beat the Dothraki.
800;01:03:14,460;01:03:16,999;We don't have the numbers.
801;01:03:17,000;01:03:18,829;We don't have the support
801;01:03:17,000;01:03:18,829;of the other houses!
802;01:03:18,830;01:03:21,500;No, we have something better.
802;01:03:18,830;01:03:21,500;We have the Iron Bank.
803;01:03:23,500;01:03:27,459;You should've listened more
803;01:03:23,500;01:03:27,459;when Father spoke about
803;01:03:23,500;01:03:27,459;the importance of gold.
804;01:03:27,460;01:03:29,619;Oh, I know it's boring for you.
805;01:03:29,620;01:03:33,249;You just wanted to hunt
805;01:03:29,620;01:03:33,249;and ride and fight.
806;01:03:33,250;01:03:35,829;But I listened, I learned.
807;01:03:35,830;01:03:39,829;Highgarden bought us
807;01:03:35,830;01:03:39,829;the most powerful army
807;01:03:35,830;01:03:39,829;in Essos--
808;01:03:39,830;01:03:41,619;the Golden Company.
809;01:03:41,620;01:03:45,329;20,000 men, horses,
809;01:03:41,620;01:03:45,329;elephants, I believe.
810;01:03:45,330;01:03:46,999;The Golden Company is not here.
811;01:03:47,000;01:03:48,369;They're in Essos.
812;01:03:48,370;01:03:52,329;How is a mercenary company
812;01:03:48,370;01:03:52,329;in Essos going to help us?
813;01:03:52,330;01:03:54,829;Do you really think
813;01:03:52,330;01:03:54,829;Euron Greyjoy turned tail
814;01:03:54,830;01:03:56,460;and sailed back
814;01:03:54,830;01:03:56,460;to the Iron Islands?
815;01:03:57,580;01:03:58,959;Do you think he abandoned
816;01:03:58,960;01:04:02,209;the chance to marry the queen?
817;01:04:02,210;01:04:04,540;No one walks away from me.
818;01:04:06,370;01:04:08,039;He's sailing with
818;01:04:06,370;01:04:08,039;his fleet to Essos.
819;01:04:08,040;01:04:10,119;He's going to ferry
819;01:04:08,040;01:04:10,119;the Golden Company back here
820;01:04:10,120;01:04:11,670;to help us win
820;01:04:10,120;01:04:11,670;the war for Westeros.
821;01:04:14,210;01:04:17,369;You plotted
821;01:04:14,210;01:04:17,369;with Euron Greyjoy
821;01:04:14,210;01:04:17,369;without telling me,
822;01:04:17,370;01:04:19,209;the commander of your armies?
823;01:04:19,210;01:04:21,829;And you conspired with Tyrion,
824;01:04:21,830;01:04:23,209;the man who murdered our father,
825;01:04:23,210;01:04:24,539;without telling me, your queen.
826;01:04:24,540;01:04:25,999;I didn't conspire with him.
827;01:04:26,000;01:04:27,869;You met with him in secret
827;01:04:26,000;01:04:27,869;without my consent.
828;01:04:27,870;01:04:29,869;You planned to promote
828;01:04:27,870;01:04:29,869;my enemies' interests.
829;01:04:29,870;01:04:32,169;That is the definition
829;01:04:29,870;01:04:32,169;of conspiracy.
830;01:04:32,170;01:04:34,539;I pledged to ride north.
831;01:04:34,540;01:04:36,369;I intend to honor that pledge.
832;01:04:36,370;01:04:38,579;And that
832;01:04:36,370;01:04:38,579;will be treason.
832;01:04:36,370;01:04:38,579;Treason?
833;01:04:38,580;01:04:40,829;Disobeying
833;01:04:38,580;01:04:40,829;your queen's command,
833;01:04:38,580;01:04:40,829;fighting with her enemies.
834;01:04:40,830;01:04:42,170;What would you call it?
835;01:04:44,170;01:04:46,040;Doesn't matter what I'd call it.
836;01:04:53,000;01:04:55,750;I told you no one
836;01:04:53,000;01:04:55,750;walks away from me.
837;01:04:58,080;01:05:00,620;Are you going to
837;01:04:58,080;01:05:00,620;order him to kill me?
838;01:05:02,750;01:05:04,709;I'm the only one you have left.
839;01:05:04,710;01:05:07,169;Our children are gone,
839;01:05:04,710;01:05:07,169;our father is gone.
840;01:05:07,170;01:05:08,919;It's just me and you now.
841;01:05:08,920;01:05:10,920;There's one more yet to come.
842;01:05:13,920;01:05:15,920;Give the order, then.
843;01:05:35,290;01:05:37,000;I don't believe you.
844;01:07:11,620;01:07:13,710;( chatter )
845;01:07:24,920;01:07:27,420;( knocking on door )
845;01:07:24,920;01:07:27,420;Come in.
846;01:07:31,420;01:07:32,869;Samwell Tarly.
847;01:07:32,870;01:07:35,079;I wasn't sure
847;01:07:32,870;01:07:35,079;if you'd remember me.
848;01:07:35,080;01:07:36,920;I remember everything.
849;01:07:42,830;01:07:45,079;( door closes )
850;01:07:45,080;01:07:47,249;You helped us
850;01:07:45,080;01:07:47,249;get beyond the Wall.
851;01:07:47,250;01:07:49,789;You're a good man.
851;01:07:47,250;01:07:49,789;Oh, well, thank you,
852;01:07:49,790;01:07:52,420;but, um, I'm not sure that I am.
853;01:07:56,580;01:07:58,750;What happened to you
853;01:07:56,580;01:07:58,750;beyond the Wall?
854;01:08:00,170;01:08:01,750;I became
854;01:08:00,170;01:08:01,750;the Three-Eyed Raven.
855;01:08:03,370;01:08:04,460;Oh!
856;01:08:07,750;01:08:10,119;I don't know what that means.
857;01:08:10,120;01:08:12,869;I can see things
857;01:08:10,120;01:08:12,869;that happened in the past.
858;01:08:12,870;01:08:16,959;I can see things happening now
859;01:08:16,960;01:08:18,460;all over the world.
860;01:08:19,870;01:08:22,290;Why did you come to Winterfell?
861;01:08:23,580;01:08:24,960;Um...
862;01:08:27,170;01:08:29,329;Jon's the one to lead
862;01:08:27,170;01:08:29,329;the fight against the dead.
863;01:08:29,330;01:08:31,419;I know he is.
864;01:08:31,420;01:08:33,369;But he can't do it alone,
865;01:08:33,370;01:08:36,249;so I've come here to help him.
866;01:08:36,250;01:08:39,119;He's on his way
866;01:08:36,250;01:08:39,119;back to Winterfell
867;01:08:39,120;01:08:40,750;with Daenerys Targaryen.
868;01:08:41,920;01:08:44,959;You--
868;01:08:41,920;01:08:44,959;you saw this in--
869;01:08:44,960;01:08:46,620;in a vision?
870;01:08:49,620;01:08:50,830;Oh.
871;01:08:53,620;01:08:55,830;He needs to know the truth.
872;01:08:57,080;01:08:58,369;The truth about what?
873;01:08:58,370;01:09:00,169;About himself.
874;01:09:00,170;01:09:03,709;No one knows.
874;01:09:00,170;01:09:03,709;No one but me.
875;01:09:03,710;01:09:06,669;Jon isn't really
875;01:09:03,710;01:09:06,669;my father's son.
876;01:09:06,670;01:09:10,829;He's the son
876;01:09:06,670;01:09:10,829;of Rhaegar Targaryen
876;01:09:06,670;01:09:10,829;and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.
877;01:09:10,830;01:09:14,669;He was born in a tower in Dorne.
878;01:09:14,670;01:09:17,119;His last name isn't really Snow,
879;01:09:17,120;01:09:18,120;it's Sand.
880;01:09:20,500;01:09:21,500;It's not.
881;01:09:23,080;01:09:25,499;Dornish bastards are named Sand.
882;01:09:25,500;01:09:29,119;At the Citadel, I transcribed
882;01:09:25,500;01:09:29,119;a High Septon's diary.
883;01:09:29,120;01:09:31,870;He annulled Rhaegar's
883;01:09:29,120;01:09:31,870;marriage to Elia.
884;01:09:33,670;01:09:36,580;He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna
884;01:09:33,670;01:09:36,580;in a secret ceremony.
885;01:09:37,870;01:09:39,329;Are you certain?
886;01:09:39,330;01:09:42,039;It's what the High Septon
886;01:09:39,330;01:09:42,039;wrote in his private diary.
