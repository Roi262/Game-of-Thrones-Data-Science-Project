2;00:02:13,537;00:02:14,853;Welcome, Lord Stark.
3;00:02:14,973;00:02:18,273;Grand Maester Pycelle has called
3;00:02:14,973;00:02:18,273;a meeting of the small council.
4;00:02:18,308;00:02:20,408;The honor of your
4;00:02:18,308;00:02:20,408;presence is requested.
5;00:02:21,910;00:02:25,013;Get the girls settled in.
5;00:02:21,910;00:02:25,013;I'll be back in time for supper.
6;00:02:25,047;00:02:27,682;And, Jory, you go with them.
6;00:02:25,047;00:02:27,682;Yes, My Lord.
7;00:02:27,717;00:02:31,453;If you'd like to change into
7;00:02:27,717;00:02:31,453;something more appropriate...
9;00:03:07,624;00:03:09,959;Thank the gods
9;00:03:07,624;00:03:09,959;you're here, Stark.
10;00:03:10,927;00:03:14,452;About time we had some stern
10;00:03:10,927;00:03:14,452;northern leadership.
11;00:03:15,365;00:03:17,066;About glad to see you're
11;00:03:15,365;00:03:17,066;protecting the throne.
12;00:03:17,100;00:03:19,134;Sturdy old thing.
13;00:03:19,169;00:03:21,637;How many kings' asses
13;00:03:19,169;00:03:21,637;have polished it, I wonder?
14;00:03:21,672;00:03:23,672;Um, what's the line?
15;00:03:23,707;00:03:26,810;The King shits
15;00:03:23,707;00:03:26,810;and the Hand wipes.
16;00:03:26,844;00:03:30,314;Very handsome armor.
17;00:03:30,348;00:03:32,750;Not a scratch on it.
17;00:03:30,348;00:03:32,750;I know.
18;00:03:32,784;00:03:36,321;People have been swinging at me for
18;00:03:32,784;00:03:36,321;years, but they always seem to miss.
19;00:03:36,355;00:03:39,224;You've chosen your
19;00:03:36,355;00:03:39,224;opponents wisely then.
20;00:03:40,460;00:03:42,495;I have a knack for it.
21;00:03:45,632;00:03:48,767;It must be strange for you
21;00:03:45,632;00:03:48,767;coming into this room.
22;00:03:51,037;00:03:54,006;I was standing right here
22;00:03:51,037;00:03:54,006;when it happened.
23;00:03:55,008;00:03:57,075;He was very brave,
23;00:03:55,008;00:03:57,075;your brother.
24;00:03:57,110;00:03:58,911;Your father too.
25;00:03:58,945;00:04:01,079;They didn't deserve
25;00:03:58,945;00:04:01,079;to die like that.
26;00:04:01,114;00:04:03,982;Nobody deserves
26;00:04:01,114;00:04:03,982;to die like that.
27;00:04:04,017;00:04:05,884;But you just stood there
27;00:04:04,017;00:04:05,884;and watched.
28;00:04:05,919;00:04:08,888;500 men just stood there
28;00:04:05,919;00:04:08,888;and watched.
29;00:04:08,922;00:04:11,691;All the great knights
29;00:04:08,922;00:04:11,691;of the Seven Kingdoms--
30;00:04:11,725;00:04:14,126;You think anyone said a
30;00:04:11,725;00:04:14,126;word, lifted a finger?
31;00:04:14,161;00:04:16,762;No, Lord Stark.
32;00:04:16,797;00:04:21,400;500 men and this room
32;00:04:16,797;00:04:21,400;was silent as a crypt.
33;00:04:23,069;00:04:25,538;Except for the screams,
33;00:04:23,069;00:04:25,538;of course,
34;00:04:25,572;00:04:28,407;and the Mad King laughing.
35;00:04:28,442;00:04:31,177;And later...
36;00:04:31,211;00:04:33,845;When I watched
36;00:04:31,211;00:04:33,845;the Mad King die,
37;00:04:33,879;00:04:37,248;I remembered him laughing
37;00:04:33,879;00:04:37,248;as your father burned...
38;00:04:38,551;00:04:40,218;It felt like justice.
39;00:04:43,222;00:04:45,890;Is that what you
39;00:04:43,222;00:04:45,890;tell yourself at night?
40;00:04:46,959;00:04:49,695;You're a servant of justice?
41;00:04:49,729;00:04:51,797;That you were avenging
41;00:04:49,729;00:04:51,797;my father when you
42;00:04:51,832;00:04:54,401;shoved your sword in
42;00:04:51,832;00:04:54,401;Aerys Targaryen's back?
43;00:04:54,435;00:04:56,203;Tell me--
44;00:04:56,238;00:04:59,273;If I'd stabbed the Mad King in
44;00:04:56,238;00:04:59,273;the belly instead of the back,
45;00:04:59,308;00:05:01,877;would you admire me more?
46;00:05:01,911;00:05:04,446;You served him well
47;00:05:04,480;00:05:07,416;when serving was safe.
48;00:05:19,263;00:05:21,498;Lord Stark.
49;00:05:23,934;00:05:25,735;Lord Varys.
50;00:05:25,770;00:05:29,138;I was grievously sorry to hear of
50;00:05:25,770;00:05:29,138;your troubles on the Kingsroad.
51;00:05:29,173;00:05:32,808;We are all praying for prince
51;00:05:29,173;00:05:32,808;Joffrey's full recovery.
52;00:05:32,843;00:05:36,278;A shame you didn't say a
52;00:05:32,843;00:05:36,278;prayer for the butcher's son.
53;00:05:37,413;00:05:40,715;Renly!
53;00:05:37,413;00:05:40,715;You're looking well.
54;00:05:40,749;00:05:42,517;And you look
54;00:05:40,749;00:05:42,517;tired from the road.
55;00:05:42,551;00:05:44,719;I told them this meeting
55;00:05:42,551;00:05:44,719;could wait another day, but--
56;00:05:44,753;00:05:47,522;But we have a kingdom
56;00:05:44,753;00:05:47,522;to look after.
57;00:05:47,556;00:05:50,825;I've hoped to meet you
57;00:05:47,556;00:05:50,825;for some time, Lord Stark.
58;00:05:50,859;00:05:54,462;No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
58;00:05:50,859;00:05:54,462;She has, Lord Baelish.
59;00:05:54,496;00:05:57,565;I understand you knew
59;00:05:54,496;00:05:57,565;my brother Brandon as well.
60;00:05:57,599;00:06:00,835;All too well.
60;00:05:57,599;00:06:00,835;I still carry a token of his esteem
61;00:06:00,869;00:06:02,838;from navel to collarbone.
62;00:06:02,872;00:06:04,940;Perhaps you chose
62;00:06:02,872;00:06:04,940;the wrong man to duel with.
63;00:06:04,974;00:06:06,942;It wasn't the man
63;00:06:04,974;00:06:06,942;that I chose, My Lord.
64;00:06:06,976;00:06:09,345;It was Catelyn Tully.
65;00:06:09,380;00:06:12,716;A woman worth fighting for,
65;00:06:09,380;00:06:12,716;I'm sure you'll agree.
66;00:06:12,750;00:06:15,419;I humbly beg your pardon,
66;00:06:12,750;00:06:15,419;my Lord Stark.
67;00:06:15,453;00:06:18,089;Grand Maester.
68;00:06:18,123;00:06:20,325;How many years has it been?
69;00:06:20,360;00:06:24,029;You were a young man.
69;00:06:20,360;00:06:24,029;And you served another King.
70;00:06:25,832;00:06:28,600;Oh, how forgetful of me.
71;00:06:30,170;00:06:32,470;This belongs to you, now.
72;00:06:35,108;00:06:36,842;Should we begin?
73;00:06:38,044;00:06:39,912;Without the King?
73;00:06:38,044;00:06:39,912;Winter may be coming,
74;00:06:39,946;00:06:43,249;but I'm afraid the same cannot
74;00:06:39,946;00:06:43,249;be said for my brother.
75;00:06:43,283;00:06:45,350;His Grace has many cares.
76;00:06:45,385;00:06:48,386;He entrusts some
76;00:06:45,385;00:06:48,386;small matters to us
77;00:06:48,420;00:06:50,221;that we might lighten the load.
78;00:06:50,256;00:06:53,157;We are the lords
78;00:06:50,256;00:06:53,157;of small matters here.
79;00:06:58,129;00:07:00,597;My brother instructs us
79;00:06:58,129;00:07:00,597;to stage a tournament
80;00:07:00,632;00:07:03,467;in honor of Lord Stark's
80;00:07:00,632;00:07:03,467;appointment as Hand of the King.
81;00:07:03,501;00:07:07,171;Mmm, how much?
81;00:07:03,501;00:07:07,171;40,000 gold dragons to the champion,
82;00:07:07,205;00:07:08,906;20,000 to the runner-up,
83;00:07:08,941;00:07:12,076;20,000 to the winning archer.
84;00:07:12,111;00:07:14,413;Can the treasury bear
84;00:07:12,111;00:07:14,413;such expense?
85;00:07:14,448;00:07:17,383;I'll have to borrow it.
85;00:07:14,448;00:07:17,383;The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect.
86;00:07:17,417;00:07:20,353;We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold.
86;00:07:17,417;00:07:20,353;What's another 80,000?
87;00:07:20,387;00:07:22,521;Are you telling me the Crown
87;00:07:20,387;00:07:22,521;is three million in debt?
88;00:07:22,556;00:07:24,623;I'm telling you the Crown
88;00:07:22,556;00:07:24,623;is six million in debt.
89;00:07:24,657;00:07:26,558;How could you let this happen?
90;00:07:26,592;00:07:28,359;The Master of Coin
90;00:07:26,592;00:07:28,359;finds the money.
91;00:07:28,394;00:07:30,828;The King and the Hand spend it.
92;00:07:30,863;00:07:32,597;I will not believe Jon Arryn
93;00:07:32,631;00:07:34,432;allowed Robert
93;00:07:32,631;00:07:34,432;to bankrupt the realm.
94;00:07:34,466;00:07:37,435;Lord Arryn gave wise
94;00:07:34,466;00:07:37,435;and prudent advice,
95;00:07:37,469;00:07:39,737;but I fear His Grace
96;00:07:39,771;00:07:43,674;doesn't always listen.
96;00:07:39,771;00:07:43,674;Counting coppers, he calls it.
97;00:07:43,708;00:07:46,076;I'll speak to him tomorrow.
98;00:07:46,111;00:07:48,979;This tournament is an
98;00:07:46,111;00:07:48,979;extravagance we cannot afford.
99;00:07:49,013;00:07:51,381;As you will.
99;00:07:49,013;00:07:51,381;But still, we'd best make our plans.
100;00:07:51,415;00:07:53,549;There will be no plans
101;00:07:53,583;00:07:55,918;until I speak to Robert.
102;00:07:59,455;00:08:01,456;Forgive me, my Lords.
102;00:07:59,455;00:08:01,456;I'm--
103;00:08:01,490;00:08:05,160;I had a long ride.
103;00:08:01,490;00:08:05,160;You are the King's Hand,
104;00:08:05,195;00:08:08,764;Lord Stark, we serve
104;00:08:05,195;00:08:08,764;at your pleasure.
105;00:08:15,407;00:08:17,875;Ow!
105;00:08:15,407;00:08:17,875;Please, it's nearly healed.
106;00:08:20,312;00:08:23,715;It's ugly.
106;00:08:20,312;00:08:23,715;A King should have scars
107;00:08:23,749;00:08:27,552;you fought off a direwolf.
107;00:08:23,749;00:08:27,552;You're a warrior like your father.
108;00:08:27,586;00:08:29,888;I'm not like him.
108;00:08:27,586;00:08:29,888;I didn't fight off anything.
109;00:08:29,922;00:08:31,924;It bit me and all
109;00:08:29,922;00:08:31,924;I did was scream.
110;00:08:31,958;00:08:34,226;And the two Stark girls
110;00:08:31,958;00:08:34,226;saw it, both of them.
111;00:08:34,260;00:08:37,330;That's not true.
111;00:08:34,260;00:08:37,330;You killed the beast.
112;00:08:37,364;00:08:40,566;You only spared the girl because of the
112;00:08:37,364;00:08:40,566;love your father bears her father.
113;00:08:40,600;00:08:41,427;I didn't, I--
114;00:08:41,547;00:08:43,617;When Aerys Targaryen
114;00:08:41,547;00:08:43,617;sat on the Iron Throne,
115;00:08:43,737;00:08:46,205;your father was a rebel
115;00:08:43,737;00:08:46,205;and a traitor.
116;00:08:46,239;00:08:50,609;Someday you'll sit on the throne and
116;00:08:46,239;00:08:50,609;the truth will be what you make it.
117;00:08:54,212;00:08:56,079;Do I have to marry her?
118;00:08:56,114;00:08:57,914;Yes.
119;00:08:59,216;00:09:01,317;She's very beautiful and young.
120;00:09:01,351;00:09:04,587;If you don't like her, you only
120;00:09:01,351;00:09:04,587;need to see her on formal occasions
121;00:09:04,622;00:09:08,524;and when the time comes, to make
121;00:09:04,622;00:09:08,524;little princes and princesses.
122;00:09:10,161;00:09:13,697;And if you'd rather fuck painted
122;00:09:10,161;00:09:13,697;whores, you'll fuck painted whores.
123;00:09:13,731;00:09:16,833;And if you'd rather lie with
123;00:09:13,731;00:09:16,833;noble virgins, so be it.
124;00:09:16,867;00:09:18,901;You are my darling boy
124;00:09:16,867;00:09:18,901;and the world will be
125;00:09:18,936;00:09:21,170;exactly as you want it to be.
126;00:09:24,342;00:09:26,643;Do something nice
126;00:09:24,342;00:09:26,643;for the Stark girl.
127;00:09:26,677;00:09:28,946;I don't want to.
127;00:09:26,677;00:09:28,946;No, but you will.
128;00:09:28,980;00:09:33,050;The occasional kindness will spare you
128;00:09:28,980;00:09:33,050;all sorts of trouble down the road.
129;00:09:34,186;00:09:36,120;We allow the northerners
129;00:09:34,186;00:09:36,120;too much power.
130;00:09:36,155;00:09:38,523;They consider themselves
130;00:09:36,155;00:09:38,523;our equals.
131;00:09:38,557;00:09:40,692;How would you handle them?
132;00:09:40,726;00:09:42,894;I'd double their taxes
133;00:09:42,928;00:09:46,430;and command them to supply
133;00:09:42,928;00:09:46,430;10,000 men to the royal army.
134;00:09:46,464;00:09:49,733;A royal army?
134;00:09:46,464;00:09:49,733;Why should every lord command his own men?
135;00:09:49,767;00:09:52,101;It's primitive, no better
135;00:09:49,767;00:09:52,101;than the hill tribes.
136;00:09:52,136;00:09:55,071;We should have a standing army
136;00:09:52,136;00:09:55,071;of men loyal to the Crown,
137;00:09:55,105;00:09:56,939;trained by
137;00:09:55,105;00:09:56,939;experienced soldiers--
138;00:09:56,974;00:10:00,576;Instead of a mob of peasants who've
138;00:09:56,974;00:10:00,576;never held pikes in their lives.
139;00:10:00,610;00:10:03,178;And if the northerners rebel?
140;00:10:03,212;00:10:04,847;I'd crush them.
141;00:10:04,881;00:10:07,583;Seize Winterfell and install
141;00:10:04,881;00:10:07,583;someone loyal to the realm
142;00:10:07,617;00:10:10,552;as Warden of the North.
142;00:10:07,617;00:10:10,552;Uncle Kevan, maybe.
143;00:10:10,587;00:10:14,256;And these 10,000 northern troops, would
143;00:10:10,587;00:10:14,256;they fight for you or their lord?
144;00:10:14,290;00:10:16,725;For me. I'm their King.
144;00:10:14,290;00:10:16,725;Mm-hmm.
145;00:10:16,759;00:10:18,860;But you've just
145;00:10:16,759;00:10:18,860;invaded their homeland,
146;00:10:18,894;00:10:21,662;asked them to kill their brothers.
146;00:10:18,894;00:10:21,662;I'm not asking.
147;00:10:21,697;00:10:24,699;The North cannot be held--
147;00:10:21,697;00:10:24,699;not by an outsider.
148;00:10:24,733;00:10:27,368;It's too big and too wild.
148;00:10:24,733;00:10:27,368;And when the winter comes,
149;00:10:27,402;00:10:30,738;the seven gods together couldn't
149;00:10:27,402;00:10:30,738;save you and your royal army.
150;00:10:30,772;00:10:33,740;A good King knows
150;00:10:30,772;00:10:33,740;when to save his strength...
151;00:10:35,243;00:10:37,577;And when to destroy
151;00:10:35,243;00:10:37,577;his enemies.
152;00:10:37,611;00:10:40,346;So you agree...
153;00:10:40,380;00:10:42,782;The Starks are enemies?
154;00:10:44,785;00:10:47,520;Everyone who isn't us
155;00:10:47,555;00:10:49,556;is an enemy.
156;00:10:51,826;00:10:54,428;Enough of that, young lady.
156;00:10:51,826;00:10:54,428;Eat your food.
157;00:10:54,463;00:10:56,364;I'm practicing.
157;00:10:54,463;00:10:56,364;Practicing for what?
158;00:10:56,399;00:10:58,466;The prince.
158;00:10:56,399;00:10:58,466;Arya, stop!
159;00:10:58,501;00:11:01,670;He's a liar and a coward
159;00:10:58,501;00:11:01,670;and he killed my friend.
160;00:11:01,704;00:11:03,497;The Hound killed your friend.
161;00:11:03,617;00:11:05,555;The Hound does whatever
161;00:11:03,617;00:11:05,555;the prince tells him to do.
162;00:11:05,675;00:11:08,277;You're an idiot.
162;00:11:05,675;00:11:08,277;You're a liar, and if you told the truth
163;00:11:08,311;00:11:11,013;Mycah would be alive.
163;00:11:08,311;00:11:11,013;Enough!
164;00:11:12,615;00:11:14,316;What's happening here?
165;00:11:14,350;00:11:17,652;Arya would rather act
165;00:11:14,350;00:11:17,652;like a beast than a lady.
166;00:11:19,321;00:11:21,656;Go to your room.
166;00:11:19,321;00:11:21,656;We'll speak later.
167;00:11:29,500;00:11:32,468;That's for you, love.
168;00:11:40,779;00:11:43,714;The same dollmaker makes all
168;00:11:40,779;00:11:43,714;of Princess Myrcella's toys.
169;00:11:46,451;00:11:48,553;Don't you like it?
170;00:11:48,587;00:11:51,490;I haven't played with dolls
170;00:11:48,587;00:11:51,490;since I was eight.
171;00:11:52,926;00:11:55,661;May I be excused?
171;00:11:52,926;00:11:55,661;You've barely eaten a thing.
172;00:11:56,864;00:11:59,366;It's all right.
172;00:11:56,864;00:11:59,366;Go on.
173;00:12:08,575;00:12:11,009;War was easier than daughters.
174;00:12:15,113;00:12:17,714;Go away!
175;00:12:17,749;00:12:20,316;Ned:
175;00:12:17,749;00:12:20,316;Arya, open the door.
176;00:12:30,260;00:12:32,561;May I come in?
177;00:12:38,968;00:12:41,703;Whose sword is that?
177;00:12:38,968;00:12:41,703;Mine.
178;00:12:41,738;00:12:43,572;Give it to me.
179;00:12:50,247;00:12:53,183;I know this maker's mark.
179;00:12:50,247;00:12:53,183;This is Mikken's work.
180;00:12:55,287;00:12:57,121;Where did you get this?
181;00:13:01,027;00:13:03,261;This is no toy.
182;00:13:05,130;00:13:08,065;Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
182;00:13:05,130;00:13:08,065;I wasn't playing.
183;00:13:08,099;00:13:10,033;And I don't want to be a lady.
184;00:13:10,067;00:13:12,468;Come here.
185;00:13:17,708;00:13:20,042;Now what do you want with this?
186;00:13:20,076;00:13:21,977;It's called Needle.
187;00:13:22,011;00:13:24,647;Oh, a blade with a name.
188;00:13:25,882;00:13:28,584;And who were you hoping
188;00:13:25,882;00:13:28,584;to skewer with Needle?
189;00:13:28,618;00:13:30,353;Your sister?
190;00:13:30,387;00:13:32,755;Do you know the first thing
190;00:13:30,387;00:13:32,755;about sword fighting?
191;00:13:32,789;00:13:34,557;Stick 'em with the pointy end.
192;00:13:34,591;00:13:37,593;That's the essence of it.
193;00:13:40,230;00:13:42,465;I was trying to learn.
194;00:13:44,201;00:13:47,070;I asked Mycah
194;00:13:44,201;00:13:47,070;to practice with me.
195;00:13:48,740;00:13:50,542;I asked him.
196;00:13:51,744;00:13:54,446;It was my fault.
196;00:13:51,744;00:13:54,446;No, sweet girl.
197;00:13:54,480;00:13:57,983;No no, you didn't kill
197;00:13:54,480;00:13:57,983;the butcher's boy.
198;00:13:59,185;00:14:02,421;I hate them!
198;00:13:59,185;00:14:02,421;I hate all of them.
199;00:14:02,455;00:14:05,057;The Hound, the Queen
199;00:14:02,455;00:14:05,057;and the King
200;00:14:05,091;00:14:06,598;and Joffrey and Sansa.
201;00:14:06,718;00:14:10,244;Sansa was dragged before
201;00:14:06,718;00:14:10,244;the King and Queen...
202;00:14:10,364;00:14:12,998;And asked to call
202;00:14:10,364;00:14:12,998;the prince a liar.
203;00:14:13,033;00:14:15,534;So was I!
203;00:14:13,033;00:14:15,534;He is a liar.
204;00:14:15,569;00:14:17,670;Shh, darling, listen to me.
205;00:14:19,139;00:14:22,175;Sansa will be married
205;00:14:19,139;00:14:22,175;to Joffrey's someday.
206;00:14:22,209;00:14:24,511;She cannot betray him.
207;00:14:24,545;00:14:27,381;She must take his side
207;00:14:24,545;00:14:27,381;even when he's wrong.
208;00:14:28,650;00:14:31,319;But how you can let her
208;00:14:28,650;00:14:31,319;marry someone like that?
209;00:14:33,222;00:14:35,123;Well.
210;00:14:36,726;00:14:39,228;Look at me.
211;00:14:39,262;00:14:42,531;You're a Stark of Winterfell.
211;00:14:39,262;00:14:42,531;You know our words.
212;00:14:44,667;00:14:46,101;Winter is coming.
213;00:14:47,402;00:14:49,804;You were born
213;00:14:47,402;00:14:49,804;in the long summer.
214;00:14:49,838;00:14:51,939;You've never known
214;00:14:49,838;00:14:51,939;anything else.
215;00:14:51,973;00:14:54,007;But now winter is truly coming.
216;00:14:54,042;00:14:56,943;And in the winter,
216;00:14:54,042;00:14:56,943;we must protect ourselves,
217;00:14:56,977;00:15:01,414;look after one another.
217;00:14:56,977;00:15:01,414;Sansa is your sister.
218;00:15:02,649;00:15:05,018;I don't hate her.
219;00:15:05,052;00:15:07,220;Not really.
220;00:15:08,488;00:15:10,456;I don't want to frighten you,
221;00:15:10,491;00:15:12,325;but I won't lie to you either.
222;00:15:12,359;00:15:14,761;We've come
222;00:15:12,359;00:15:14,761;to a dangerous place.
223;00:15:14,795;00:15:18,432;We cannot fight a war
223;00:15:14,795;00:15:18,432;amongst ourselves.
224;00:15:19,334;00:15:21,335;All right?
225;00:15:21,369;00:15:25,305;Go on.
225;00:15:21,369;00:15:25,305;It's yours.
226;00:15:27,809;00:15:29,709;I can keep it?
227;00:15:29,743;00:15:32,912;Try not to stab
227;00:15:29,743;00:15:32,912;your sister with it.
229;00:15:41,486;00:15:43,854;If you're going to own a sword,
230;00:15:43,889;00:15:45,756;you'd better
230;00:15:43,889;00:15:45,756;know how to use it.
233;00:15:53,563;00:15:57,198;Don't listen to it.
233;00:15:53,563;00:15:57,198;Crows are all liars.
234;00:15:59,435;00:16:03,037;I know a story about a crow.
234;00:15:59,435;00:16:03,037;I hate your stories.
235;00:16:03,072;00:16:06,909;I know a story about a boy
235;00:16:03,072;00:16:06,909;who hated stories.
236;00:16:06,943;00:16:10,313;I could tell you about
236;00:16:06,943;00:16:10,313;Ser Duncan the Tall.
237;00:16:10,347;00:16:12,315;Those were always
237;00:16:10,347;00:16:12,315;your favorites.
238;00:16:12,350;00:16:14,718;Those weren't my favorites.
239;00:16:14,752;00:16:17,388;My favorites were
239;00:16:14,752;00:16:17,388;the scary ones.
240;00:16:18,791;00:16:22,994;Oh, my sweet summer child.
240;00:16:18,791;00:16:22,994;What do you know about fear?
241;00:16:24,463;00:16:26,264;Fear is for the winter,
242;00:16:26,299;00:16:29,268;when the snows fall
242;00:16:26,299;00:16:29,268;a hundred feet deep.
243;00:16:29,302;00:16:31,404;Fear is for the long night,
244;00:16:31,438;00:16:34,407;when the sun hides for years
245;00:16:34,441;00:16:37,177;and children are born
245;00:16:34,441;00:16:37,177;and live and die
246;00:16:37,212;00:16:39,913;all in darkness.
247;00:16:39,948;00:16:42,983;That is the time for fear,
247;00:16:39,948;00:16:42,983;my little Lord,
248;00:16:43,018;00:16:46,353;when the white walkers
248;00:16:43,018;00:16:46,353;move through the woods.
249;00:16:47,722;00:16:50,891;Thousands of years ago
249;00:16:47,722;00:16:50,891;there came a night
250;00:16:50,926;00:16:53,027;that lasted a generation.
251;00:16:53,061;00:16:55,997;Kings froze to death
251;00:16:53,061;00:16:55,997;in their castles,
252;00:16:56,031;00:16:58,265;same as the shepherds
252;00:16:56,031;00:16:58,265;in their huts.
253;00:16:58,300;00:17:01,169;And women smothered
253;00:16:58,300;00:17:01,169;their babies
254;00:17:01,203;00:17:03,338;rather than see them starve,
255;00:17:03,372;00:17:07,375;and wept and felt the tears
255;00:17:03,372;00:17:07,375;freeze on their cheeks.
256;00:17:07,410;00:17:11,113;So is this the sort
256;00:17:07,410;00:17:11,113;of story that you like?
257;00:17:14,151;00:17:16,252;In that darkness,
258;00:17:16,287;00:17:18,789;the White Walkers
258;00:17:16,287;00:17:18,789;came for the first time.
259;00:17:18,823;00:17:21,958;They swept through cities
259;00:17:18,823;00:17:21,958;and kingdoms,
260;00:17:21,993;00:17:24,160;riding their dead horses,
261;00:17:24,194;00:17:28,130;hunting with their packs of
261;00:17:24,194;00:17:28,130;pale spiders big as hounds--
263;00:17:32,348;00:17:34,695;What are you telling him now?
264;00:17:34,815;00:17:36,904;Only what what are the little
264;00:17:34,815;00:17:36,904;lord wants to hear.
265;00:17:36,939;00:17:42,174;Get your supper.
265;00:17:36,939;00:17:42,174;I want some time with him.
266;00:17:50,185;00:17:52,587;One time she told me
267;00:17:52,621;00:17:54,890;the sky is blue because
267;00:17:52,621;00:17:54,890;we live inside the eye
268;00:17:54,924;00:17:57,759;of a blue-eyed giant
268;00:17:54,924;00:17:57,759;named Macomber.
269;00:17:57,794;00:18:00,028;Maybe we do.
270;00:18:02,364;00:18:04,699;How do you feel?
271;00:18:08,069;00:18:10,203;You still don't
271;00:18:08,069;00:18:10,203;remember anything?
272;00:18:12,140;00:18:14,141;Bran,
273;00:18:14,175;00:18:16,342;I've seen you climb
273;00:18:14,175;00:18:16,342;a thousand times.
274;00:18:16,377;00:18:18,244;In the wind, in the rain--
275;00:18:18,279;00:18:20,379;A thousand times.
276;00:18:20,413;00:18:22,781;You never fall.
276;00:18:20,413;00:18:22,781;I did though.
277;00:18:25,752;00:18:28,019;It's true, isn't it,
278;00:18:28,054;00:18:31,390;what Maester Luwin
278;00:18:28,054;00:18:31,390;says about my legs?
279;00:18:38,865;00:18:40,900;I'd rather be dead.
280;00:18:42,202;00:18:45,406;Don't ever say that.
280;00:18:42,202;00:18:45,406;I'd rather be dead.
281;00:18:57,053;00:18:59,689;Fewer eyes back here, My Lady.
282;00:18:59,723;00:19:01,724;But still too many.
283;00:19:01,758;00:19:04,393;It's nine years since I've
283;00:19:01,758;00:19:04,393;set foot in the capital.
284;00:19:04,427;00:19:07,796;And no one knew who I was the
284;00:19:04,427;00:19:07,796;last time I came either.
285;00:19:11,333;00:19:13,834;My Lady.
286;00:19:13,869;00:19:17,137;Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
286;00:19:13,869;00:19:17,137;Would you mind following us?
287;00:19:17,172;00:19:19,038;I would.
287;00:19:17,172;00:19:19,038;We've done nothing wrong.
288;00:19:19,073;00:19:21,374;We've been instructed to
288;00:19:19,073;00:19:21,374;escort you into the city.
289;00:19:21,409;00:19:23,209;Instructed?
290;00:19:23,244;00:19:25,946;I don't know who's providing
290;00:19:23,244;00:19:25,946;your instructions, but--
291;00:19:25,980;00:19:27,714;Follow me, Lady Stark.
292;00:19:38,627;00:19:41,430;Cat!
292;00:19:38,627;00:19:41,430;Go on.
293;00:19:41,464;00:19:43,298;Go upstairs.
294;00:19:45,502;00:19:48,203;You little worm!
295;00:19:48,238;00:19:51,006;You take me for some
295;00:19:48,238;00:19:51,006;back-alley Sally
296;00:19:51,041;00:19:52,474;you can drag into a--
297;00:19:54,378;00:19:55,978;Pssst!
298;00:19:58,014;00:20:00,049;I meant no disrespect
299;00:20:00,083;00:20:02,451;to you of all people.
300;00:20:02,485;00:20:04,619;How dare you bring me here!
301;00:20:04,654;00:20:06,454;Have you lost your mind?
302;00:20:06,489;00:20:09,124;No one will come looking for you here.
302;00:20:06,489;00:20:09,124;Isn't that what you wanted?
303;00:20:09,158;00:20:12,694;I'm truly sorry
303;00:20:09,158;00:20:12,694;about the locale.
304;00:20:12,728;00:20:15,197;How did you know I was
304;00:20:12,728;00:20:15,197;coming to King's Landing?
305;00:20:16,299;00:20:18,300;A dear friend told me.
306;00:20:19,935;00:20:22,770;Lady Stark.
306;00:20:19,935;00:20:22,770;Lord Varys.
307;00:20:22,805;00:20:26,807;To see you again after so
307;00:20:22,805;00:20:26,807;many years is a blessing.
308;00:20:26,842;00:20:28,342;Your poor hands.
309;00:20:30,778;00:20:32,379;How did you know I was coming?
310;00:20:32,413;00:20:34,881;Knowledge is my trade, My Lady.
312;00:20:36,683;00:20:39,218;Did you bring the dagger
312;00:20:36,683;00:20:39,218;with you, by any chance?
313;00:20:40,820;00:20:43,221;My little birds
313;00:20:40,820;00:20:43,221;are everywhere...
314;00:20:43,255;00:20:45,490;Even in the north.
315;00:20:45,524;00:20:49,060;They whisper to me
315;00:20:45,524;00:20:49,060;the strangest stories.
316;00:20:54,466;00:20:56,534;Valyrian steel.
317;00:20:56,568;00:20:59,337;Do you know whose dagger
317;00:20:56,568;00:20:59,337;this is?
318;00:21:00,539;00:21:02,774;I must admit I do not.
319;00:21:02,808;00:21:06,677;Well well, this is an historic day.
320;00:21:06,712;00:21:08,813;Something you don't know
321;00:21:08,847;00:21:11,315;that I do.
322;00:21:13,284;00:21:17,154;There's only one dagger like this
322;00:21:13,284;00:21:17,154;in all of the Seven Kingdoms.
323;00:21:18,590;00:21:21,158;It's mine.
323;00:21:18,590;00:21:21,158;Yours?
324;00:21:21,192;00:21:25,762;At least it was, until the tournament
324;00:21:21,192;00:21:25,762;on Prince Joffrey's last nameday.
325;00:21:25,797;00:21:28,632;I bet on Ser Jaime
325;00:21:25,797;00:21:28,632;in the jousting,
326;00:21:28,666;00:21:30,468;as any sane man would.
327;00:21:30,502;00:21:33,003;When the Knight of the
327;00:21:30,502;00:21:33,003;Glowers unseated him,
328;00:21:33,038;00:21:35,607;I lost this dagger.
329;00:21:35,641;00:21:37,809;To whom?
330;00:21:37,843;00:21:39,711;Tyrion Lannister.
331;00:21:39,746;00:21:41,914;The Imp.
332;00:21:41,948;00:21:44,750;Grenn, show him what
332;00:21:41,948;00:21:44,750;you farm boys are made of.
334;00:21:50,123;00:21:53,091;If that were a real sword, you'd be dead.
335;00:21:53,126;00:21:56,394;Lord Snow here
335;00:21:53,126;00:21:56,394;grew up in a castle
336;00:21:56,429;00:21:58,730;spitting down
336;00:21:56,429;00:21:58,730;on the likes of you.
337;00:21:58,764;00:22:00,866;Pyp.
338;00:22:00,900;00:22:02,902;Do you think
338;00:22:00,900;00:22:02,902;Ned Stark's bastard
339;00:22:02,936;00:22:04,971;bleeds like the rest of us?
342;00:22:12,245;00:22:13,913;Next!
343;00:22:24,526;00:22:26,126;Next!
344;00:22:39,739;00:22:41,440;Well, Lord Snow,
345;00:22:41,474;00:22:43,975;it appears you're
345;00:22:41,474;00:22:43,975;the least useless person here.
346;00:22:45,177;00:22:46,611;Go clean yourselves up.
347;00:22:46,645;00:22:49,548;There's only so much
347;00:22:46,645;00:22:49,548;I can stomach in a day.
348;00:22:49,582;00:22:52,551;A charming man.
349;00:22:52,585;00:22:54,686;I don't need him
349;00:22:52,585;00:22:54,686;to be charming.
350;00:22:54,720;00:22:57,389;I need him to turn this bunch
350;00:22:54,720;00:22:57,389;of thieves and runaways
351;00:22:57,424;00:22:59,258;into men of the Night's Watch.
352;00:22:59,292;00:23:02,094;And how's that going,
352;00:22:59,292;00:23:02,094;Commander Mormont?
353;00:23:02,129;00:23:04,497;Slowly.
354;00:23:06,767;00:23:08,401;A raven came
355;00:23:08,436;00:23:10,337;for Ned Stark's son.
356;00:23:13,909;00:23:16,411;Good news or bad?
357;00:23:16,445;00:23:18,146;Both.
358;00:23:19,415;00:23:22,583;Lord Stark.
359;00:23:22,618;00:23:25,620;I meant to give you this earlier.
360;00:23:27,756;00:23:29,958;So forgetful these days.
361;00:23:31,793;00:23:34,562;A raven from Winterfell
361;00:23:31,793;00:23:34,562;this morning.
362;00:23:45,272;00:23:47,540;Good news?
363;00:23:50,911;00:23:53,513;Perhaps you'd like to
363;00:23:50,911;00:23:53,513;share it with your wife?
364;00:23:56,050;00:23:58,652;My wife is in Winterfell.
364;00:23:56,050;00:23:58,652;Is she?
365;00:24:06,661;00:24:08,929;Woman:
365;00:24:06,661;00:24:08,929;Yes, I'm looking at you.
367;00:24:12,233;00:24:14,234;I thought that she'd
367;00:24:12,233;00:24:14,234;be safest in here.
368;00:24:14,269;00:24:17,170;One of several such
368;00:24:14,269;00:24:17,170;establishments I own.
369;00:24:19,407;00:24:20,875;You're a funny man.
370;00:24:20,909;00:24:23,511;Huh?
370;00:24:20,909;00:24:23,511;A very funny man.
371;00:24:24,780;00:24:26,080;Ned!
372;00:24:33,690;00:24:35,491;Ah, the Starks--
373;00:24:35,526;00:24:38,762;Quick tempers, slow minds.
374;00:24:43,535;00:24:46,237;You broke my nose, bastard!
375;00:24:53,478;00:24:55,546;It's an improvement.
376;00:24:58,716;00:25:01,885;If we threw you over the Wall, I wonder
376;00:24:58,716;00:25:01,885;how long it would take you to hit.
377;00:25:01,919;00:25:03,954;I wonder if they'd find you
377;00:25:01,919;00:25:03,954;before the wolves did.
379;00:25:08,660;00:25:10,761;What're you looking at,
379;00:25:08,660;00:25:10,761;Half Man?
380;00:25:10,795;00:25:13,330;I'm looking at you.
381;00:25:13,364;00:25:15,632;Yes.
382;00:25:15,667;00:25:18,735;You've got an interesting face.
383;00:25:19,737;00:25:22,940;Hmm, very distinctive faces.
384;00:25:22,974;00:25:24,608;All of you.
385;00:25:24,642;00:25:26,844;And what do you care
385;00:25:24,642;00:25:26,844;about our faces?
386;00:25:26,878;00:25:30,080;It's just I think
386;00:25:26,878;00:25:30,080;they would look marvelous
387;00:25:30,115;00:25:32,750;decorating spikes
387;00:25:30,115;00:25:32,750;in King's Landing.
388;00:25:32,784;00:25:35,919;Perhaps I'll write my sister,
388;00:25:32,784;00:25:35,919;the Queen, about it.
389;00:25:38,156;00:25:40,491;We'll talk later, Lord Snow.
390;00:25:46,164;00:25:48,765;Everybody knew
390;00:25:46,164;00:25:48,765;what this place was
391;00:25:48,800;00:25:50,768;and no one told me.
392;00:25:50,802;00:25:53,204;No one but you.
393;00:25:53,238;00:25:55,072;My father knew
394;00:25:55,107;00:25:57,375;and he left me to rot
394;00:25:55,107;00:25:57,375;at the Wall all the same.
395;00:25:57,409;00:25:59,043;Grenn's father left him too...
396;00:25:59,078;00:26:02,414;Outside a farmhouse
396;00:25:59,078;00:26:02,414;when he was three.
397;00:26:02,448;00:26:06,318;Pyp was caught stealing
397;00:26:02,448;00:26:06,318;a wheel of cheese.
398;00:26:06,352;00:26:09,755;His little sister hadn't
398;00:26:06,352;00:26:09,755;eaten in three days.
399;00:26:09,789;00:26:13,526;He was given a choice:
399;00:26:09,789;00:26:13,526;his right hand or the Wall.
400;00:26:13,560;00:26:16,094;I've been asking the Lord
400;00:26:13,560;00:26:16,094;Commander about them.
401;00:26:16,129;00:26:17,313;Fascinating stories.
402;00:26:17,433;00:26:19,636;They hate me because
402;00:26:17,433;00:26:19,636;I'm better than they are.
403;00:26:19,756;00:26:21,267;It's a lucky thing
403;00:26:19,756;00:26:21,267;none of them were trained
404;00:26:21,301;00:26:23,836;by a master-at-arms
404;00:26:21,301;00:26:23,836;like your Ser Rodrik.
405;00:26:23,870;00:26:26,705;I don't imagine any of them
405;00:26:23,870;00:26:26,705;have ever held a real sword
406;00:26:26,739;00:26:28,841;before they came here.
407;00:26:32,045;00:26:34,012;Oh...
408;00:26:34,047;00:26:37,082;Your brother Bran.
409;00:26:37,117;00:26:39,418;He's woken up.
410;00:26:40,687;00:26:42,788;The mere suggestion
410;00:26:40,687;00:26:42,788;that the Queen's brother
411;00:26:42,822;00:26:45,123;tried to kill your boy
411;00:26:42,822;00:26:45,123;would be considered treason.
412;00:26:45,158;00:26:47,393;We have proof.
412;00:26:45,158;00:26:47,393;We have the blade.
413;00:26:47,427;00:26:49,561;Which Lord Tyrion will say
413;00:26:47,427;00:26:49,561;was stolen from him.
414;00:26:49,596;00:26:52,164;The only man who could say
414;00:26:49,596;00:26:52,164;otherwise has no throat,
415;00:26:52,198;00:26:54,432;thanks to your boy's wolf.
416;00:26:54,467;00:26:57,435;Petyr has promised
416;00:26:54,467;00:26:57,435;to help us find the truth.
417;00:26:58,671;00:27:00,572;He's like a little brother
417;00:26:58,671;00:27:00,572;to me, Ned.
418;00:27:00,607;00:27:02,841;He would never betray my trust.
419;00:27:02,875;00:27:05,476;I'll try to keep you
419;00:27:02,875;00:27:05,476;alive, for her sake.
420;00:27:05,511;00:27:07,145;A fool's task, admittedly,
421;00:27:07,179;00:27:09,947;but I've never been able
421;00:27:07,179;00:27:09,947;to refuse your wife anything.
422;00:27:09,981;00:27:12,115;I won't forget this.
423;00:27:12,150;00:27:14,217;You're a true friend.
424;00:27:14,252;00:27:17,520;Don't tell anyone.
424;00:27:14,252;00:27:17,520;I have a reputation to maintain.
426;00:27:21,692;00:27:24,194;How could you be so stupid?
426;00:27:21,692;00:27:24,194;Calm down.
427;00:27:24,228;00:27:26,062;He's a child--
427;00:27:24,228;00:27:26,062;10 years old.
428;00:27:26,096;00:27:28,498;What were you thinking?
428;00:27:26,096;00:27:28,498;I was thinking of us.
429;00:27:28,532;00:27:31,134;You're a bit late to start
429;00:27:28,532;00:27:31,134;complaining about it now.
430;00:27:31,168;00:27:33,036;What has the boy told them?
430;00:27:31,168;00:27:33,036;Nothing.
431;00:27:33,070;00:27:35,038;He's said nothing.
431;00:27:33,070;00:27:35,038;He remembers nothing.
432;00:27:35,072;00:27:37,207;Then what are you raving about?
433;00:27:37,241;00:27:38,875;What if it comes back to him?
434;00:27:38,910;00:27:40,711;If he tells his father
434;00:27:38,910;00:27:40,711;what he saw--
435;00:27:40,745;00:27:43,180;We'll say he was lying.
435;00:27:40,745;00:27:43,180;We'll say he was dreaming.
436;00:27:43,215;00:27:44,749;We'll say whatever we like.
437;00:27:44,783;00:27:47,051;I think we can outfox
437;00:27:44,783;00:27:47,051;a 10-year-old.
438;00:27:47,086;00:27:50,321;And my husband?
438;00:27:47,086;00:27:50,321;I'll go to war with him if I have to.
439;00:27:50,356;00:27:53,125;They can write
439;00:27:50,356;00:27:53,125;a ballad about us:
440;00:27:53,159;00:27:55,460;The War for Cersei's Cunt.
442;00:28:00,366;00:28:02,368;Let me go.
442;00:28:00,366;00:28:02,368;Never.
443;00:28:02,402;00:28:05,036;Let me go.
443;00:28:02,402;00:28:05,036;The boy
444;00:28:05,071;00:28:07,338;won't talk.
445;00:28:07,373;00:28:09,374;And if he does, I'll kill him.
446;00:28:09,409;00:28:12,844;Him, Ned Stark, the King--
446;00:28:09,409;00:28:12,844;the whole bloody lot of them,
447;00:28:12,878;00:28:15,713;until you and I are
447;00:28:12,878;00:28:15,713;the only people
448;00:28:15,747;00:28:17,948;left in this world.
449;00:28:28,359;00:28:30,393;I wish I could see the girls.
450;00:28:30,428;00:28:33,663;It's too dangerous.
450;00:28:30,428;00:28:33,663;Just for a moment.
451;00:28:33,697;00:28:35,965;Until we know
451;00:28:33,697;00:28:35,965;who our enemies are--
452;00:28:36,000;00:28:38,201;I know they did it, Ned.
452;00:28:36,000;00:28:38,201;The Lannisters.
453;00:28:38,235;00:28:40,236;In my bones, I know it.
454;00:28:40,270;00:28:42,271;Littlefinger's right.
455;00:28:43,874;00:28:46,176;I can't do anything
455;00:28:43,874;00:28:46,176;without proof.
456;00:28:46,210;00:28:48,745;And if you find the proof?
457;00:28:48,779;00:28:50,980;Then I bring it to Robert...
458;00:28:51,015;00:28:53,784;And hope he's still
458;00:28:51,015;00:28:53,784;the man I once knew.
459;00:28:55,553;00:28:57,554;You watch yourself
459;00:28:55,553;00:28:57,554;on the road, huh?
460;00:28:57,589;00:29:01,025;That temper of yours
460;00:28:57,589;00:29:01,025;is a dangerous thing.
461;00:29:01,059;00:29:03,895;My temper?
461;00:29:01,059;00:29:03,895;Gods be good,
462;00:29:03,930;00:29:06,698;you nearly killed poor
462;00:29:03,930;00:29:06,698;Littlefinger yesterday.
463;00:29:11,504;00:29:13,205;He still loves you.
464;00:29:13,239;00:29:16,275;Does he?
465;00:29:33,659;00:29:35,493;Off with you.
467;00:30:07,290;00:30:10,759;Yes, it's been a long time.
468;00:30:10,794;00:30:14,529;But I still remember
468;00:30:10,794;00:30:14,529;every face.
469;00:30:16,098;00:30:18,232;You remember your first?
470;00:30:20,636;00:30:22,804;Of course, Your Grace.
471;00:30:22,838;00:30:24,873;Who was it?
472;00:30:24,907;00:30:27,042;A Tyroshi.
473;00:30:27,076;00:30:29,344;Never learned the name.
473;00:30:27,076;00:30:29,344;Hmm.
474;00:30:29,378;00:30:31,680;How'd you do it?
475;00:30:31,715;00:30:33,782;Lance through the heart.
476;00:30:33,817;00:30:35,652;Quick one.
477;00:30:37,021;00:30:39,389;Lucky for you.
478;00:30:39,423;00:30:43,294;Mine was some Tarly boy
478;00:30:39,423;00:30:43,294;at the Battle of Summerhall.
479;00:30:44,763;00:30:47,297;My horse took an arrow
479;00:30:44,763;00:30:47,297;so I was on foot,
480;00:30:47,332;00:30:49,333;slogging through the mud.
481;00:30:50,635;00:30:55,973;He came running at me,
481;00:30:50,635;00:30:55,973;this dumb high-born lad,
482;00:30:56,007;00:30:58,176;thinking he could end
482;00:30:56,007;00:30:58,176;the rebellion
483;00:30:58,210;00:31:00,744;with single swing of his sword.
484;00:31:02,080;00:31:04,081;I knocked him down
484;00:31:02,080;00:31:04,081;with the hammer.
485;00:31:04,116;00:31:06,484;Gods, I was strong then.
486;00:31:06,518;00:31:09,354;Caved in his breastplate.
487;00:31:09,388;00:31:12,557;Probably shattered
487;00:31:09,388;00:31:12,557;every rib he had.
488;00:31:12,592;00:31:16,429;Stood over him,
488;00:31:12,592;00:31:16,429;hammer in the air.
489;00:31:16,463;00:31:20,800;Right before I brought it down
489;00:31:16,463;00:31:20,800;he shouted, Wait!
490;00:31:20,835;00:31:23,870;Wait.
491;00:31:28,208;00:31:31,911;They never tell you
491;00:31:28,208;00:31:31,911;how they all shit themselves.
492;00:31:31,945;00:31:36,481;They don't put that part
492;00:31:31,945;00:31:36,481;in the songs.
493;00:31:39,017;00:31:41,519;Stupid boy.
494;00:31:42,621;00:31:45,223;Now the Tarlys bend the knee
495;00:31:45,257;00:31:47,659;like everyone else.
496;00:31:47,693;00:31:49,828;He could have lingered
497;00:31:49,862;00:31:52,531;on the edge of the battle
497;00:31:49,862;00:31:52,531;with the smart boys
498;00:31:52,565;00:31:56,168;and today his wife would
498;00:31:52,565;00:31:56,168;be making him miserable,
499;00:31:56,203;00:31:59,172;his sons would be ingrates,
500;00:31:59,206;00:32:02,242;and he'd be waking
500;00:31:59,206;00:32:02,242;three times in the night
501;00:32:02,276;00:32:05,178;to piss into a bowl.
501;00:32:02,276;00:32:05,178;Wine!
502;00:32:08,181;00:32:12,785;Lancel.
502;00:32:08,181;00:32:12,785;Gods, what a stupid name.
503;00:32:13,753;00:32:17,356;Lancel Lannister.
504;00:32:17,390;00:32:21,560;Who named you?
504;00:32:17,390;00:32:21,560;Some halfwit with a stutter?
506;00:32:23,963;00:32:26,799;What are you doing?
507;00:32:28,201;00:32:30,736;It's empty, Your Grace.
507;00:32:28,201;00:32:30,736;What do you mean it's empty?
508;00:32:30,770;00:32:33,605;There's no more wine.
508;00:32:30,770;00:32:33,605;Is that what empty means?
509;00:32:35,675;00:32:38,043;So get more.
510;00:32:41,714;00:32:43,948;Tell your cousin
510;00:32:41,714;00:32:43,948;to get in here.
511;00:32:43,982;00:32:45,383;Kingslayer!
512;00:32:45,417;00:32:47,452;Get in here.
513;00:32:54,892;00:32:58,094;Surrounded by Lannisters.
514;00:32:58,128;00:33:02,365;Every time I close my eyes
514;00:32:58,128;00:33:02,365;I see their blond hair
515;00:33:02,399;00:33:05,668;and their smug,
515;00:33:02,399;00:33:05,668;satisfied faces.
516;00:33:05,702;00:33:08,470;It must wound your pride, huh?
517;00:33:08,505;00:33:11,473;Standing out there
517;00:33:08,505;00:33:11,473;like a glorified sentry.
518;00:33:12,909;00:33:16,779;Jaime Lannister,
518;00:33:12,909;00:33:16,779;son of the mighty Tywin...
519;00:33:18,048;00:33:20,484;Forced to mind the door
519;00:33:18,048;00:33:20,484;while your King
520;00:33:20,518;00:33:23,487;eats and drinks
520;00:33:20,518;00:33:23,487;and shits and fucks.
521;00:33:25,390;00:33:26,990;So come on.
522;00:33:27,025;00:33:29,125;We're telling war stories.
523;00:33:30,361;00:33:33,997;Who was your first kill,
523;00:33:30,361;00:33:33,997;not counting old men?
524;00:33:35,232;00:33:37,867;One of the outlaws
524;00:33:35,232;00:33:37,867;in the Brotherhood.
525;00:33:37,902;00:33:40,470;I was there that day.
526;00:33:40,504;00:33:43,673;You were only a squire,
526;00:33:40,504;00:33:43,673;16 years old.
527;00:33:43,707;00:33:46,609;You killed Simon Toyne
527;00:33:43,707;00:33:46,609;with a counter riposte.
528;00:33:46,643;00:33:48,911;Best move I ever saw.
529;00:33:48,945;00:33:53,182;A good fighter, Toyne,
529;00:33:48,945;00:33:53,182;but he lacked stamina.
530;00:33:53,216;00:33:55,351;Your outlaw...
531;00:33:55,386;00:33:57,954;Any last words?
532;00:33:57,988;00:34:00,823;I cut his head off, so no.
532;00:33:57,988;00:34:00,823;Hmmm.
533;00:34:00,858;00:34:03,794;What about Aerys Targaryen?
534;00:34:03,828;00:34:07,764;What did the Mad King say when
534;00:34:03,828;00:34:07,764;you stabbed him in the back?
535;00:34:07,799;00:34:09,867;I never asked.
536;00:34:09,901;00:34:12,937;Did he call you a traitor?
537;00:34:12,971;00:34:16,141;Did he plead for a reprieve?
538;00:34:17,610;00:34:20,645;He said the same thing
538;00:34:17,610;00:34:20,645;he'd been saying for hours...
539;00:34:22,315;00:34:24,515;Burn them all.
540;00:34:29,287;00:34:31,221;If that's all, Your Grace...
542;00:35:03,485;00:35:05,920;Do the Dothraki buy
542;00:35:03,485;00:35:05,920;their slaves?
543;00:35:05,954;00:35:08,089;The Dothraki don't
543;00:35:05,954;00:35:08,089;believe in money.
544;00:35:08,123;00:35:10,424;Most of their slaves were
544;00:35:08,123;00:35:10,424;given to them as gifts.
545;00:35:10,458;00:35:12,693;From whom?
545;00:35:10,458;00:35:12,693;If you rule a city
546;00:35:12,727;00:35:15,662;and you see the horde approaching,
546;00:35:12,727;00:35:15,662;you have two choices:
547;00:35:15,696;00:35:17,530;Pay tribute or fight.
548;00:35:17,565;00:35:19,265;An easy choice for most.
549;00:35:19,299;00:35:22,802;Of course, sometimes
549;00:35:19,299;00:35:22,802;it's not enough.
550;00:35:22,836;00:35:26,272;Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by
550;00:35:22,836;00:35:26,272;the number of slaves he's given.
551;00:35:26,307;00:35:28,875;He might think the men too weak
551;00:35:26,307;00:35:28,875;or the women too ugly.
552;00:35:28,910;00:35:32,446;Sometimes a Khal decides his riders
552;00:35:28,910;00:35:32,446;haven't had a good fight in months
553;00:35:32,480;00:35:35,783;and need the practice.
553;00:35:32,480;00:35:35,783;Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.
555;00:35:38,154;00:35:40,922;Tell them all to stop.
556;00:35:40,957;00:35:43,091;You want the entire
556;00:35:40,957;00:35:43,091;horde to stop?
557;00:35:43,125;00:35:45,460;For how long?
558;00:35:45,494;00:35:48,529;Until I command them otherwise.
559;00:35:48,563;00:35:50,931;You're learning
559;00:35:48,563;00:35:50,931;to talk like a Queen.
560;00:35:50,966;00:35:53,033;Not a Queen.
561;00:35:53,068;00:35:54,969;A Khaleesi.
562;00:36:05,213;00:36:07,749;Annakhas dozgosores.
565;00:36:31,842;00:36:33,943;You dare!
566;00:36:33,978;00:36:37,448;You give commands to me?
566;00:36:33,978;00:36:37,448;To me?
567;00:36:39,284;00:36:42,987;You do not command the dragon.
567;00:36:39,284;00:36:42,987;I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
568;00:36:43,021;00:36:45,390;I don't take orders
568;00:36:43,021;00:36:45,390;from savages
569;00:36:45,424;00:36:47,925;or their sluts.
569;00:36:45,424;00:36:47,925;Do you hear me?

571;00:36:53,166;00:36:55,968;Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.
572;00:36:56,002;00:36:57,470;No.
573;00:36:57,504;00:36:59,505;Ishish chare acharoe

575;00:37:02,643;00:37:06,312;to teach respect.
575;00:37:02,643;00:37:06,312;Please please, don't hurt him.
576;00:37:10,317;00:37:14,052;Tell him I don't want
576;00:37:10,317;00:37:14,052;my brother harmed.

581;00:37:35,809;00:37:37,677;I am your King!
582;00:37:39,714;00:37:42,783;Shall we return
582;00:37:39,714;00:37:42,783;to the Khalasar, khaleesi?
583;00:38:02,602;00:38:04,936;Uh uh uh uh uh.
584;00:38:04,970;00:38:08,073;You walk.
591;00:40:38,267;00:40:42,736;I wanted to be here when you
591;00:40:38,267;00:40:42,736;saw it for the first time.
592;00:40:50,779;00:40:54,181;I'm leaving this morning.
592;00:40:50,779;00:40:54,181;You're leaving?
593;00:40:55,250;00:40:57,484;I'm the First Ranger.
594;00:40:57,519;00:40:59,787;My job is out there.
595;00:40:59,821;00:41:03,157;There have been disturbing reports.
595;00:40:59,821;00:41:03,157;What kind of reports?
596;00:41:03,191;00:41:05,092;The kind I don't
596;00:41:03,191;00:41:05,092;want to believe.
597;00:41:06,728;00:41:09,230;I'm ready.
597;00:41:06,728;00:41:09,230;I won't let you down.
598;00:41:09,264;00:41:11,799;You're not going.
599;00:41:14,269;00:41:16,037;You're no ranger, Jon.
600;00:41:16,071;00:41:18,806;But I'm better than every--
600;00:41:16,071;00:41:18,806;Better than no one!
601;00:41:23,979;00:41:25,846;Here...
602;00:41:25,880;00:41:28,215;A man gets what he earns,
603;00:41:28,249;00:41:30,417;when he earns it.
604;00:41:34,356;00:41:36,590;We'll speak when I return.
606;00:41:52,039;00:41:55,242;A bear's balls.
606;00:41:52,039;00:41:55,242;Oh, you're joking?
607;00:41:55,276;00:41:58,813;And his brains and his guts,
607;00:41:55,276;00:41:58,813;his lungs and his heart
608;00:41:58,847;00:42:01,349;all fried in his own fat.
609;00:42:01,383;00:42:03,985;When you're a hundred miles
609;00:42:01,383;00:42:03,985;north of the Wall
610;00:42:04,020;00:42:07,521;and you ate your last meal a week ago,
610;00:42:04,020;00:42:07,521;you leave nothing for the wolves.
611;00:42:07,556;00:42:10,825;And how do
611;00:42:07,556;00:42:10,825;a bear's balls taste?
612;00:42:10,860;00:42:13,161;A bit chewy.
613;00:42:15,264;00:42:18,800;And what about you, My Lord?
613;00:42:15,264;00:42:18,800;What's the strangest thing you've eaten?
614;00:42:18,834;00:42:21,202;Do Dornish girls count?
616;00:42:25,173;00:42:28,308;So you roam the Seven Kingdoms,
617;00:42:28,342;00:42:30,543;collaring pickpockets
617;00:42:28,342;00:42:30,543;and horse thieves
618;00:42:30,577;00:42:32,678;and bringing them here
618;00:42:30,577;00:42:32,678;as eager recruits?
619;00:42:32,713;00:42:34,513;Aye.
620;00:42:34,548;00:42:37,549;But it's not all of 'em's
620;00:42:34,548;00:42:37,549;done bad things.
621;00:42:37,584;00:42:40,585;Some of 'em's just poor lads
621;00:42:37,584;00:42:40,585;looking for steady feed.
622;00:42:40,620;00:42:43,321;Some of 'em's high-born lads
622;00:42:40,620;00:42:43,321;looking for glory.
623;00:42:43,355;00:42:46,891;They have a better chance finding feed
623;00:42:43,355;00:42:46,891;than glory.
624;00:42:46,925;00:42:50,461;The Night's Watch is
624;00:42:46,925;00:42:50,461;a joke to you, is it?
625;00:42:50,495;00:42:53,031;Is that what we are, Lannister?
626;00:42:53,065;00:42:55,900;An army of jesters in black?
627;00:42:55,934;00:42:58,069;You don't have enough men
627;00:42:55,934;00:42:58,069;to be an army
628;00:42:58,103;00:43:01,739;and aside from Yoren here, none
628;00:42:58,103;00:43:01,739;of you are particularly funny.
629;00:43:01,774;00:43:04,509;I hope we've provided you
629;00:43:01,774;00:43:04,509;with some good stories to tell
630;00:43:04,544;00:43:06,478;when you're back
630;00:43:04,544;00:43:06,478;in King's Landing.
631;00:43:06,513;00:43:08,047;But something to think about
632;00:43:08,081;00:43:10,182;while you're drinking
632;00:43:08,081;00:43:10,182;your wine down there,
633;00:43:10,217;00:43:12,151;enjoying your brothels--
634;00:43:12,186;00:43:16,523;Half the boys you've seen training
634;00:43:12,186;00:43:16,523;will die north of the Wall.
635;00:43:16,558;00:43:20,027;Might be a wilding's axe
635;00:43:16,558;00:43:20,027;that gets them,
636;00:43:20,061;00:43:22,729;might be sickness,
637;00:43:22,764;00:43:25,598;might just be the cold.
638;00:43:25,633;00:43:28,334;They die in pain.
639;00:43:28,368;00:43:31,904;And they do it so plump
639;00:43:28,368;00:43:31,904;little lords like you
640;00:43:31,938;00:43:35,407;can enjoy their summer
640;00:43:31,938;00:43:35,407;afternoons in peace and comfort.
641;00:43:37,409;00:43:39,410;Do you think I'm plump?
642;00:43:43,148;00:43:45,549;Listen, Benjen--
642;00:43:43,148;00:43:45,549;May I call you Benjen?
643;00:43:45,584;00:43:46,770;Call me what you like.
644;00:43:46,890;00:43:49,201;I'm not sure what I've
644;00:43:46,890;00:43:49,201;done to offend you.
645;00:43:49,321;00:43:51,489;I have great admiration
645;00:43:49,321;00:43:51,489;for the Night's Watch.
646;00:43:51,523;00:43:54,092;I've great admiration
646;00:43:51,523;00:43:54,092;for you as First Ranger.
647;00:43:54,126;00:43:56,160;You know, my brother
647;00:43:54,126;00:43:56,160;once told me
648;00:43:56,195;00:43:58,797;that nothing someone says
648;00:43:56,195;00:43:58,797;before the word but
649;00:43:58,831;00:44:00,731;really counts.
650;00:44:00,766;00:44:03,268;But...
651;00:44:03,302;00:44:06,537;I don't believe that giants
651;00:44:03,302;00:44:06,537;and ghouls and White Walkers
652;00:44:06,571;00:44:08,372;are lurking beyond the Wall.
653;00:44:08,406;00:44:10,774;I believe that
653;00:44:08,406;00:44:10,774;the only difference
654;00:44:10,809;00:44:13,076;between us and
654;00:44:10,809;00:44:13,076;the wildlings is that
655;00:44:13,110;00:44:15,445;when the Wall went up,
655;00:44:13,110;00:44:15,445;our ancestors happened
656;00:44:15,480;00:44:17,713;to live on
656;00:44:15,480;00:44:17,713;the right side of it.
657;00:44:17,748;00:44:19,648;You're right.
658;00:44:21,251;00:44:23,352;The wildlings are
658;00:44:21,251;00:44:23,352;no different from us.
659;00:44:23,386;00:44:26,255;A little rougher maybe.
660;00:44:26,289;00:44:29,058;But they're made
660;00:44:26,289;00:44:29,058;of meat and bone.
661;00:44:29,093;00:44:31,695;I know how to track them
661;00:44:29,093;00:44:31,695;and I know how to kill them.
662;00:44:31,729;00:44:35,666;It's not the wildlings
662;00:44:31,729;00:44:35,666;giving me sleepless nights.
663;00:44:36,802;00:44:38,970;You've never been
663;00:44:36,802;00:44:38,970;north of the Wall,
664;00:44:39,004;00:44:41,406;so don't tell me
664;00:44:39,004;00:44:41,406;what's out there.
665;00:44:44,911;00:44:46,945;Are you going below?
666;00:44:48,447;00:44:51,816;Keep well, keep warm.
666;00:44:48,447;00:44:51,816;Enjoy the capital, brother.
667;00:44:51,851;00:44:54,352;Oh, I always do.
668;00:45:02,695;00:45:04,963;I think he's starting
668;00:45:02,695;00:45:04,963;to like me.
670;00:45:07,701;00:45:11,170;Going below?
670;00:45:07,701;00:45:11,170;Aye.
671;00:45:11,205;00:45:12,839;Into the tunnel
672;00:45:12,873;00:45:15,009;and out the other side.
673;00:45:15,043;00:45:17,779;He'll be north of the Wall
673;00:45:15,043;00:45:17,779;for a month or two.
674;00:45:19,915;00:45:23,084;So you're heading down
674;00:45:19,915;00:45:23,084;to King's Landing too.
675;00:45:23,119;00:45:25,687;Aye, day after tomorrow.
676;00:45:25,722;00:45:29,525;I get about half of my
676;00:45:25,722;00:45:29,525;recruits from their dungeons.
677;00:45:29,559;00:45:33,829;Let's share the road.
677;00:45:29,559;00:45:33,829;I could use some decent company.
678;00:45:33,864;00:45:38,902;I... I travel a bit
678;00:45:33,864;00:45:38,902;on the grubby side, My Lord.
679;00:45:38,936;00:45:42,940;Not this time. We'll be staying at
679;00:45:38,936;00:45:42,940;the finest castles and inns.
680;00:45:42,974;00:45:45,709;No one turns away a Lannister.
681;00:45:51,215;00:45:53,482;At Jakar?
682;00:45:53,517;00:45:55,317;Athjahakar.
683;00:45:55,351;00:45:57,586;Ath ja haker.
684;00:45:57,620;00:45:59,554;Athjahakar.
685;00:45:59,588;00:46:01,456;Athjahakar.
686;00:46:01,490;00:46:03,257;Yes, Khaleesi.
687;00:46:05,027;00:46:07,261;Oh, what are you doing?
688;00:46:07,296;00:46:09,897;When was last time
688;00:46:07,296;00:46:09,897;you bleed, Khaleesi?
689;00:46:12,334;00:46:14,368;You change, Khaleesi.
691;00:46:23,413;00:46:26,282;For a man on horseback,
691;00:46:23,413;00:46:26,282;the curved blade
692;00:46:26,316;00:46:28,818;is a good thing,
692;00:46:26,316;00:46:28,818;easier to handle.
693;00:46:28,852;00:46:32,322;It's a good weapon
693;00:46:28,852;00:46:32,322;for a Dothrakan.
694;00:46:32,356;00:46:35,125;But a man in full plate--
695;00:46:35,159;00:46:36,960;Shori tawakof
696;00:46:36,995;00:46:39,963;the arakh won't get
696;00:46:36,995;00:46:39,963;through the steel.
697;00:46:41,199;00:46:43,300;That's where the broadsword
697;00:46:41,199;00:46:43,300;has the advantage.
698;00:46:43,335;00:46:46,337;Designed for piercing plate.
700;00:46:50,508;00:46:53,743;Armor.
700;00:46:50,508;00:46:53,743;Armor.
701;00:46:53,777;00:46:56,412;Armor make a man...
702;00:46:56,446;00:46:58,580;Vroz?
702;00:46:56,446;00:46:58,580;Slow.
703;00:46:58,614;00:47:00,548;Slow.
703;00:46:58,614;00:47:00,548;It's true,
704;00:47:00,583;00:47:03,884;but it also keeps a man alive.
705;00:47:21,805;00:47:24,306;He still is.
706;00:47:24,341;00:47:26,809;A man of great honor
707;00:47:26,843;00:47:28,811;and I betrayed him.
708;00:47:52,436;00:47:54,904;I don't think
708;00:47:52,436;00:47:54,904;she wants to eat dog.
709;00:47:58,175;00:48:00,943;The Khaleesi
709;00:47:58,175;00:48:00,943;have baby inside her.
710;00:48:02,479;00:48:05,649;It is true.
710;00:48:02,479;00:48:05,649;She does not bleed for two moons.
711;00:48:05,683;00:48:08,218;Her belly start to swell.
712;00:48:10,155;00:48:14,058;She does not want to eat horse.
713;00:48:15,461;00:48:18,364;I'll have the boys
713;00:48:15,461;00:48:18,364;butcher a goat for supper.
715;00:48:23,537;00:48:26,205;I need to ride to Qohor.
716;00:48:29,142;00:48:33,145;Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak.
717;00:48:33,180;00:48:35,514;Don't worry.
717;00:48:33,180;00:48:35,514;I'll catch you.
718;00:48:35,548;00:48:37,983;The horde's easy to find.
720;00:48:48,461;00:48:50,362;Don't stand so still.
721;00:48:50,396;00:48:53,932;It's harder to hit
721;00:48:50,396;00:48:53,932;a moving target.
722;00:48:58,104;00:49:00,939;Except for you.
722;00:48:58,104;00:49:00,939;You move too much.
723;00:49:00,973;00:49:03,675;I could just hold my sword out
723;00:49:00,973;00:49:03,675;and let you do the work for me.
724;00:49:08,847;00:49:11,815;How many winters have
724;00:49:08,847;00:49:11,815;you seen, Lord Tyrion?
725;00:49:11,850;00:49:14,484;Eight-- no, nine.
726;00:49:14,518;00:49:17,053;All of them brief?
727;00:49:17,087;00:49:20,322;They say the winter of my birth was
727;00:49:17,087;00:49:20,322;three years long, Maester Aemon.
728;00:49:20,357;00:49:23,392;This summer has lasted nine.
729;00:49:23,426;00:49:27,762;But reports from the Citadel
729;00:49:23,426;00:49:27,762;tell us the days grow shorter.
730;00:49:27,796;00:49:30,231;The Starks are always
730;00:49:27,796;00:49:30,231;right eventually:
731;00:49:30,265;00:49:33,234;Winter is coming.
732;00:49:33,268;00:49:36,069;This one will be long
733;00:49:36,103;00:49:38,805;and dark things
733;00:49:36,103;00:49:38,805;will come with it.
734;00:49:38,839;00:49:41,908;We've been capturing wildlings,
735;00:49:41,942;00:49:44,977;more every month.
735;00:49:41,942;00:49:44,977;They're fleeing south.
736;00:49:45,012;00:49:49,249;The ones who flee say they've seen
736;00:49:45,012;00:49:49,249;the White Walkers.
737;00:49:49,283;00:49:52,687;Yes, and the fishermen of
737;00:49:49,283;00:49:52,687;Lannisport say they see mermaids.
738;00:49:52,721;00:49:56,124;One of our own rangers swore he
738;00:49:52,721;00:49:56,124;saw them kill his companions.
739;00:49:56,158;00:49:58,226;He swore it right up
739;00:49:56,158;00:49:58,226;to the moment
740;00:49:58,261;00:50:00,162;Ned Stark chopped his head off.
741;00:50:00,196;00:50:02,832;The Night's Watch
741;00:50:00,196;00:50:02,832;is the only thing
742;00:50:02,866;00:50:04,900;standing between the realm
743;00:50:04,935;00:50:07,202;and what lies beyond.
744;00:50:07,237;00:50:09,438;And it has has become an army
745;00:50:09,472;00:50:13,074;of undisciplined boys
745;00:50:09,472;00:50:13,074;and tired old men.
746;00:50:13,109;00:50:16,643;There are less than
746;00:50:13,109;00:50:16,643;a thousand of us now.
747;00:50:16,678;00:50:19,513;We can't man the other
747;00:50:16,678;00:50:19,513;castles on the Wall.
748;00:50:19,547;00:50:22,649;We can't properly
748;00:50:19,547;00:50:22,649;patrol the wilderness.
749;00:50:22,683;00:50:26,352;We've barely enough resources
749;00:50:22,683;00:50:26,352;to keep our lads armed
750;00:50:26,387;00:50:29,022;and fed.
750;00:50:26,387;00:50:29,022;Your sister
751;00:50:29,056;00:50:31,858;sits by the side the King.
752;00:50:31,893;00:50:34,761;Tell her we need help.
753;00:50:34,796;00:50:37,131;When winter does come,
754;00:50:37,165;00:50:40,601;gods help us all
754;00:50:37,165;00:50:40,601;if we're not ready.
756;00:51:47,338;00:51:49,773;I'm sorry to see
756;00:51:47,338;00:51:49,773;you leave, Lannister.
757;00:51:51,509;00:51:53,444;It's either me or this cold.
758;00:51:53,478;00:51:55,846;And it doesn't appear
758;00:51:53,478;00:51:55,846;to be going anywhere.
759;00:51:55,880;00:51:58,849;Will you stop at Winterfell
759;00:51:55,880;00:51:58,849;on your way South?
760;00:51:58,884;00:52:00,117;I expect I will.
761;00:52:00,151;00:52:02,186;Gods know there aren't
761;00:52:00,151;00:52:02,186;many feather beds
762;00:52:02,220;00:52:04,354;between here
762;00:52:02,220;00:52:04,354;and King's Landing.
763;00:52:04,389;00:52:06,523;If you see my brother Bran,
764;00:52:06,558;00:52:09,093;tell him I miss him.
765;00:52:09,127;00:52:11,161;Tell him I'd visit if I could.
766;00:52:11,195;00:52:12,763;Of course.
767;00:52:12,797;00:52:15,366;He'll never walk again.
768;00:52:15,400;00:52:17,067;If you're going to be
768;00:52:15,400;00:52:17,067;a cripple,
769;00:52:17,101;00:52:19,336;it's better to be a rich cripple.
770;00:52:19,371;00:52:21,839;You take care, Snow.
771;00:52:21,873;00:52:23,874;Farewell, My Lord.
772;00:52:35,619;00:52:38,188;You are late, boy.
773;00:52:40,057;00:52:42,558;Tomorrow you will
773;00:52:40,057;00:52:42,558;be here at midday.
774;00:52:42,592;00:52:44,826;Who are you?
775;00:52:44,861;00:52:47,329;Your dancing master,
776;00:52:47,363;00:52:48,931;Syrio Forel.
777;00:52:53,036;00:52:54,536;Tomorrow you will catch it.
778;00:52:54,571;00:52:56,572;Now pick it up.
779;00:52:58,875;00:53:01,177;That is not the way, boy.
780;00:53:01,211;00:53:05,382;This is not a greatsword that is
780;00:53:01,211;00:53:05,382;needing two hands to swing it.
781;00:53:05,416;00:53:09,553;It's too heavy.
781;00:53:05,416;00:53:09,553;It is heavy as it needs to be
782;00:53:09,588;00:53:11,456;to make you strong.
783;00:53:12,358;00:53:13,892;Just so.
784;00:53:13,926;00:53:16,361;One hand is all that is needed.
785;00:53:17,597;00:53:19,732;Now you are standing all wrong.
786;00:53:19,766;00:53:22,135;Turn your body sideface.
787;00:53:22,169;00:53:24,604;Yes.
788;00:53:24,638;00:53:26,807;So.
789;00:53:26,841;00:53:29,175;You are skinny.
789;00:53:26,841;00:53:29,175;That is good.
790;00:53:29,210;00:53:32,212;The target is smaller.
791;00:53:32,246;00:53:34,314;Now the grip--
791;00:53:32,246;00:53:34,314;Let me see.
792;00:53:34,348;00:53:37,116;Yes.
793;00:53:37,151;00:53:39,986;The grip must be delicate.
794;00:53:40,954;00:53:42,855;What if I drop it?
795;00:53:42,890;00:53:45,224;The steel must be
795;00:53:42,890;00:53:45,224;part of your arm.
796;00:53:45,258;00:53:47,994;Can you drop
796;00:53:45,258;00:53:47,994;part of your arm? No.
797;00:53:48,028;00:53:52,264;Nine years Syrio Forel was first
797;00:53:48,028;00:53:52,264;sword to the Sealord of Braavos.
798;00:53:52,299;00:53:55,067;He knows these things.
798;00:53:52,299;00:53:55,067;You must listen to me, boy.
799;00:53:55,101;00:53:56,869;I'm a girl.
800;00:53:56,903;00:54:00,473;Boy, girl--
800;00:53:56,903;00:54:00,473;you are a sword,
801;00:54:00,507;00:54:03,409;that is all.
802;00:54:03,443;00:54:05,845;That is the grip.
803;00:54:05,880;00:54:08,048;You are not holding
803;00:54:05,880;00:54:08,048;a battle-axe.
804;00:54:08,082;00:54:10,417;You are holding--
804;00:54:08,082;00:54:10,417;A needle.
805;00:54:10,452;00:54:11,452;Ahhh.
807;00:54:13,121;00:54:15,723;Just so.
808;00:54:15,758;00:54:18,593;Now we will begin the dance.
809;00:54:18,628;00:54:20,095;Remember, child,
810;00:54:20,129;00:54:23,098;this is not the dance of the
810;00:54:20,129;00:54:23,098;Westeros we are learning--
811;00:54:23,132;00:54:25,267;The knight's dance,
812;00:54:25,301;00:54:27,702;hacking and hammering.
813;00:54:27,737;00:54:30,872;This is the Bravo's dance...
814;00:54:32,375;00:54:34,342;The water dance.
815;00:54:34,376;00:54:36,611;It is swift
816;00:54:36,645;00:54:38,913;and sudden.
817;00:54:40,382;00:54:42,683;All men are made of water,
818;00:54:42,718;00:54:44,452;do you know this?
819;00:54:44,486;00:54:46,788;If you pierce them,
820;00:54:46,822;00:54:50,591;the water leaks out
820;00:54:46,822;00:54:50,591;and they die.
821;00:54:51,759;00:54:55,095;Now you will try to strike me.
823;00:54:58,132;00:54:59,932;Ha!
824;00:55:11,646;00:55:13,146;Up!

828;00:55:32,666;00:55:34,233;Dead.

836;00:55:51,150;00:55:53,151;Again, faster.
