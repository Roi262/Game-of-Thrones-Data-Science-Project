3;00:02:24,659;00:02:27,127;Your pardon, Your Grace.
4;00:02:27,161;00:02:29,262;I would rise, but...
5;00:02:29,296;00:02:31,698;Do you know what
5;00:02:29,296;00:02:31,698;your wife has done?
6;00:02:33,033;00:02:35,202;She did nothing
6;00:02:33,033;00:02:35,202;I did not command.
7;00:02:35,236;00:02:36,970;Who'd have thought
7;00:02:35,236;00:02:36,970;she had it in her?
8;00:02:37,005;00:02:39,039;By what right dare you lay
8;00:02:37,005;00:02:39,039;hands on my blood?
9;00:02:39,074;00:02:40,634;I am the King's Hand, charged
9;00:02:39,074;00:02:40,634;with keeping the peace...
10;00:02:40,659;00:02:42,261;You were the King's Hand.
11;00:02:42,711;00:02:44,279;You shall now be held
11;00:02:42,711;00:02:44,279;accountable.
12;00:02:44,313;00:02:46,315;Oh, will both of you
12;00:02:44,313;00:02:46,315;shut your mouths?!
13;00:02:48,618;00:02:51,954;Catelyn will release Tyrion and
13;00:02:48,618;00:02:51,954;you'll make your peace with Jaime.
14;00:02:51,989;00:02:53,689;He butchered my men--
15;00:02:53,723;00:02:56,192;Lord Stark was
15;00:02:53,723;00:02:56,192;returning drunk
16;00:02:56,226;00:02:58,660;from a brothel
16;00:02:56,226;00:02:58,660;when his men attacked Jaime.
17;00:02:58,694;00:03:02,264;Quiet, woman.
17;00:02:58,694;00:03:02,264;Jaime has fled the city.
18;00:03:02,298;00:03:05,233;Give me leave to bring him
18;00:03:02,298;00:03:05,233;back to justice.
19;00:03:07,069;00:03:09,004;I took you for a King.
20;00:03:09,038;00:03:11,106;Hold your tongue.
20;00:03:09,038;00:03:11,106;He's attacked
21;00:03:11,140;00:03:13,275;one of my brothers
21;00:03:11,140;00:03:13,275;and abducted the other.
22;00:03:13,309;00:03:15,677;I should wear the armor
22;00:03:13,309;00:03:15,677;and you the gown.
23;00:03:27,957;00:03:30,091;I shall wear this
23;00:03:27,957;00:03:30,091;like a badge of honor.
24;00:03:33,195;00:03:36,464;Wear it in silence
24;00:03:33,195;00:03:36,464;or I'll honor you again.
25;00:03:50,811;00:03:52,712;See what she does to me?
26;00:03:52,746;00:03:55,715;My loving wife.
27;00:04:01,422;00:04:03,757;I should not have
27;00:04:01,422;00:04:03,757;hit her.
28;00:04:03,791;00:04:05,893;That was not...
29;00:04:06,995;00:04:09,196;That was not Kingly.
30;00:04:10,833;00:04:13,635;If we don't act,
31;00:04:13,670;00:04:15,971;there will be a war.
32;00:04:16,005;00:04:19,874;So tell your wife to return
32;00:04:16,005;00:04:19,874;that little shit of an Imp
33;00:04:19,909;00:04:22,310;to King's Landing.
34;00:04:22,345;00:04:25,013;She's had her fun,
34;00:04:22,345;00:04:25,013;now put an end to it.
35;00:04:26,483;00:04:29,318;You hear me?
35;00:04:26,483;00:04:29,318;Send a raven and put an end to it.
36;00:04:29,352;00:04:32,154;And what about
36;00:04:29,352;00:04:32,154;Jaime Lannister?
37;00:04:34,624;00:04:37,460;What about Jaime?
37;00:04:34,624;00:04:37,460;I'm half a Kingdom in debt
38;00:04:37,494;00:04:39,862;to his bloody father.
39;00:04:39,896;00:04:43,800;I don't know what happened between
39;00:04:39,896;00:04:43,800;you and those yellow-haired shits.
40;00:04:43,834;00:04:46,570;I don't want to know.
40;00:04:43,834;00:04:46,570;This is what matters--
41;00:04:46,604;00:04:48,639;I can't rule the Kingdoms
42;00:04:48,673;00:04:51,675;if the Starks and the Lannisters
42;00:04:48,673;00:04:51,675;are at each other's throats.
43;00:04:51,710;00:04:53,944;So enough.
44;00:04:55,714;00:04:58,283;As you command,
44;00:04:55,714;00:04:58,283;Your Grace.
45;00:04:58,317;00:05:00,786;With your leave,
46;00:05:00,820;00:05:03,955;I will return to Winterfell
46;00:05:00,820;00:05:03,955;and set matters straight.
47;00:05:03,990;00:05:05,891;Piss on that.
47;00:05:03,990;00:05:05,891;Send a raven.
48;00:05:05,925;00:05:07,559;I want you to stay.
49;00:05:07,593;00:05:10,663;I'm the King.
49;00:05:07,593;00:05:10,663;I get what I want.
50;00:05:15,401;00:05:18,870;I never loved my brothers.
51;00:05:18,905;00:05:22,608;A sad thing for a man
51;00:05:18,905;00:05:22,608;to admit, but it's true.
52;00:05:26,113;00:05:28,481;You were the brother
52;00:05:26,113;00:05:28,481;I chose.
53;00:05:35,189;00:05:37,324;We'll talk when I return
53;00:05:35,189;00:05:37,324;from the hunt.
54;00:05:39,560;00:05:41,294;The hunt?
55;00:05:41,329;00:05:44,732;Killing things
55;00:05:41,329;00:05:44,732;clears my head.
56;00:05:44,767;00:05:47,502;You'll have to sit on the
56;00:05:44,767;00:05:47,502;throne while I'm away.
57;00:05:47,536;00:05:50,238;You'll hate it more than I do.
58;00:05:50,272;00:05:52,006;The Targaryen girl--
59;00:05:52,041;00:05:55,609;seven hells,
59;00:05:52,041;00:05:55,609;don't start with her again.
60;00:05:55,643;00:05:58,479;The girl will die
60;00:05:55,643;00:05:58,479;and I'll hear no more of it.
61;00:05:58,513;00:06:01,549;Put on the badge.
61;00:05:58,513;00:06:01,549;And if you ever take it off again,
62;00:06:01,583;00:06:05,686;I swear to the mother I'll pin the
62;00:06:01,583;00:06:05,686;damned thing on Jaime Lannister.
63;00:07:26,991;00:07:29,225;Khaleesi?
64;00:07:31,662;00:07:33,596;Oh, Khaleesi!
65;00:07:44,743;00:07:46,578;You're hurt.
66;00:08:40,031;00:08:43,467;Not too fast.
66;00:08:40,031;00:08:43,467;Come on, Dancer.
67;00:08:43,501;00:08:45,368;When are you gonna
67;00:08:43,501;00:08:45,368;tell him?
68;00:08:45,403;00:08:47,471;Not now.
69;00:08:47,505;00:08:49,273;Blood for blood.
69;00:08:47,505;00:08:49,273;Bran: Come on!
70;00:08:49,307;00:08:51,808;You need to make the Lannisters
70;00:08:49,307;00:08:51,808;pay for Jory and the others.
71;00:08:51,842;00:08:54,144;Robb: You're talking about war.
71;00:08:51,842;00:08:54,144;I'm talking about justice.
72;00:08:54,179;00:08:56,413;Only the Lord of Winterfell
73;00:08:56,447;00:08:58,415;can call in the bannermen
73;00:08:56,447;00:08:58,415;and raise an army.
74;00:08:58,449;00:09:00,717;A Lannister put his spear
74;00:08:58,449;00:09:00,717;through your father's leg.
75;00:09:00,752;00:09:03,754;The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock
75;00:09:00,752;00:09:03,754;where no one can touch him--
76;00:09:03,789;00:09:05,657;you want me to march
76;00:09:03,789;00:09:05,657;on Casterly Rock?
77;00:09:05,691;00:09:07,959;You're not a boy anymore.
77;00:09:05,691;00:09:07,959;Bran: Come on.
78;00:09:07,993;00:09:10,962;They attacked your father.
78;00:09:07,993;00:09:10,962;They've already started the war.
79;00:09:10,996;00:09:15,200;It's your duty to represent your
79;00:09:10,996;00:09:15,200;House when your father can't.
80;00:09:15,235;00:09:18,871;And it's not your duty,
80;00:09:15,235;00:09:18,871;because it's not your House.
81;00:09:28,881;00:09:30,982;Where's Bran?
82;00:09:33,219;00:09:36,087;I don't know.
82;00:09:33,219;00:09:36,087;It's not my House.
83;00:10:08,553;00:10:11,222;Robb?
84;00:10:11,256;00:10:14,559;All alone in the deep,
84;00:10:11,256;00:10:14,559;dark woods.
85;00:10:17,563;00:10:19,697;I'm not alone.
85;00:10:17,563;00:10:19,697;My brother is with me.
86;00:10:19,731;00:10:21,432;I don't see him.
87;00:10:21,467;00:10:23,434;Got him hidden
87;00:10:21,467;00:10:23,434;under your cloak?
88;00:10:23,468;00:10:25,670;Ooh, that's a pretty pin.
89;00:10:25,704;00:10:28,339;Silver.
89;00:10:25,704;00:10:28,339;We'll take the pin
90;00:10:28,373;00:10:31,642;and the horse.
90;00:10:28,373;00:10:31,642;Get down.
91;00:10:33,245;00:10:34,711;Be quick about it.
92;00:10:34,746;00:10:36,180;I can't.
93;00:10:36,214;00:10:38,282;The saddle--
93;00:10:36,214;00:10:38,282;the straps.
94;00:10:41,719;00:10:44,788;What's wrong with you?
94;00:10:41,719;00:10:44,788;You some kind of cripple?
95;00:10:44,823;00:10:46,491;I'm Brandon Stark
95;00:10:44,823;00:10:46,491;of Winterfell.
96;00:10:46,525;00:10:48,760;If you don't let me be,
96;00:10:46,525;00:10:48,760;I'll have you all killed!
97;00:10:48,794;00:10:51,429;Cut his little cock off
97;00:10:48,794;00:10:51,429;and stuff it in his mouth.
98;00:10:51,464;00:10:53,832;The boy's
98;00:10:51,464;00:10:53,832;worth nothing dead.
99;00:10:53,866;00:10:56,067;Benjen Stark's
99;00:10:53,866;00:10:56,067;own blood?
100;00:10:56,102;00:10:59,371;Think what Mance
100;00:10:56,102;00:10:59,371;would give us.
101;00:10:59,405;00:11:02,775;Piss on Mance Rayder
101;00:10:59,405;00:11:02,775;and piss on the North.
102;00:11:02,809;00:11:06,011;We're going as far South
102;00:11:02,809;00:11:06,011;as South goes.
103;00:11:06,045;00:11:09,581;There ain't no White Walkers
103;00:11:06,045;00:11:09,581;down in Dorne.
104;00:11:09,616;00:11:11,917;Drop the knife!
105;00:11:11,951;00:11:14,920;Let him go and I'll let you live.
106;00:11:34,906;00:11:36,907;Robb.
107;00:11:36,942;00:11:39,844;Robb.
107;00:11:36,942;00:11:39,844;Shut up.
108;00:11:39,878;00:11:42,179;Drop the blade!
109;00:11:42,214;00:11:44,315;No, don't.
109;00:11:42,214;00:11:44,315;Do it.
110;00:12:22,785;00:12:24,720;Are you all right?
111;00:12:24,754;00:12:27,490;Yes.
111;00:12:24,754;00:12:27,490;It doesn't hurt.
112;00:12:28,425;00:12:30,393;Tough little lad.
113;00:12:30,427;00:12:33,930;In the Iron Islands, you're not a man
113;00:12:30,427;00:12:33,930;until you've killed your first enemy.
114;00:12:33,964;00:12:35,565;Well done.
115;00:12:36,500;00:12:38,467;Have you lost your mind?
116;00:12:38,502;00:12:40,303;What if you'd missed?
117;00:12:40,337;00:12:42,738;He would have killed you
117;00:12:40,337;00:12:42,738;and cut Bran's throat.
118;00:12:42,772;00:12:45,374;You don't have the right--
118;00:12:42,772;00:12:45,374;To what, to save your brother's life?
119;00:12:45,408;00:12:48,276;It was the only thing
119;00:12:45,408;00:12:48,276;to do, so I did it.
120;00:12:50,112;00:12:52,046;What about her?
121;00:12:57,853;00:13:00,889;Give me my life,
121;00:12:57,853;00:13:00,889;My Lord, and I'm yours.
122;00:13:02,758;00:13:04,659;We'll keep her alive.
123;00:13:28,583;00:13:30,384;Mord!
124;00:13:30,418;00:13:33,654;Turnkey!
124;00:13:30,418;00:13:33,654;Mord!
125;00:13:34,956;00:13:37,091;Mord!
126;00:13:40,897;00:13:43,032;Dwarf man
126;00:13:40,897;00:13:43,032;making noise!
127;00:13:45,602;00:13:47,336;How would you like
127;00:13:45,602;00:13:47,336;to be rich?
128;00:13:47,371;00:13:49,872;Dwarf man still
128;00:13:47,371;00:13:49,872;making noise.
129;00:13:50,775;00:13:52,442;My family is rich.
130;00:13:52,476;00:13:54,210;We have gold,
130;00:13:52,476;00:13:54,210;lots of gold.
131;00:13:54,245;00:13:56,779;I'm prepared to give you
131;00:13:54,245;00:13:56,779;lots of gold in--
132;00:13:59,283;00:14:01,317;No gold!
133;00:14:01,351;00:14:03,352;Well, I don't
133;00:14:01,351;00:14:03,352;have it here.
134;00:14:03,387;00:14:05,788;No gold.
135;00:14:05,822;00:14:07,523;Fuck off.
136;00:14:33,451;00:14:35,686;I don't want
136;00:14:33,451;00:14:35,686;to practice today.
137;00:14:35,720;00:14:38,054;No?
138;00:14:38,089;00:14:40,491;They killed Jory.
139;00:14:40,525;00:14:43,427;My father is hurt.
140;00:14:43,462;00:14:45,963;I don't care about
140;00:14:43,462;00:14:45,963;stupid wooden swords.
141;00:14:45,998;00:14:47,831;You are troubled.
142;00:14:47,866;00:14:49,533;Yes.
142;00:14:47,866;00:14:49,533;Good!
143;00:14:49,567;00:14:51,802;Trouble is the perfect
143;00:14:49,567;00:14:51,802;time for training.
144;00:14:51,837;00:14:55,139;When you are dancing in the meadow
144;00:14:51,837;00:14:55,139;with your dolls and kittens,
145;00:14:55,174;00:14:57,108;this is not
145;00:14:55,174;00:14:57,108;when fighting happens.
146;00:14:57,143;00:14:59,411;I don't like
146;00:14:57,143;00:14:59,411;dolls and k--
147;00:15:00,279;00:15:02,347;You're not here.
148;00:15:03,316;00:15:05,351;You're with
148;00:15:03,316;00:15:05,351;your trouble.
149;00:15:05,385;00:15:08,120;If you are with your trouble
149;00:15:05,385;00:15:08,120;when fighting happens--
150;00:15:12,226;00:15:13,994;--More trouble for you.
151;00:15:14,028;00:15:16,229;Just so.
152;00:15:17,598;00:15:20,299;How can you be
152;00:15:17,598;00:15:20,299;quick as a snake...
153;00:15:24,238;00:15:26,505;...Or as quiet
153;00:15:24,238;00:15:26,505;as a shadow...
154;00:15:30,777;00:15:33,579;...When you are
154;00:15:30,777;00:15:33,579;somewhere else?
155;00:15:36,082;00:15:38,217;You are fearing
155;00:15:36,082;00:15:38,217;for your father, hmm?
156;00:15:40,386;00:15:42,721;That is right.
157;00:15:42,756;00:15:45,991;Do you pray to the gods?
157;00:15:42,756;00:15:45,991;The old and the new.
158;00:15:47,661;00:15:50,330;There is only one God
159;00:15:50,364;00:15:53,267;and his name is Death.
160;00:15:53,301;00:15:56,303;And there is only one thing
160;00:15:53,301;00:15:56,303;we say to Death:
161;00:15:57,438;00:15:59,406;Not today.
162;00:16:07,683;00:16:10,018;Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!
163;00:16:10,052;00:16:12,621;Priestess: Khalakka Dothrae!
163;00:16:10,052;00:16:12,621;Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!
164;00:16:12,655;00:16:15,056;Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!
164;00:16:12,655;00:16:15,056;Khalakka Dothrae!
165;00:16:24,833;00:16:26,900;She has to eat
165;00:16:24,833;00:16:26,900;the whole heart?
166;00:16:27,869;00:16:29,736;I hope that wasn't
166;00:16:27,869;00:16:29,736;my horse.
167;00:16:29,771;00:16:31,605;She's doing well.
168;00:16:31,639;00:16:33,640;She'll never
168;00:16:31,639;00:16:33,640;keep it down.
169;00:16:33,675;00:16:35,809;Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!
170;00:16:35,844;00:16:38,345;Khalakka Dothrae!
171;00:16:55,031;00:16:55,097;Khalakka Dothrae!
172;00:16:57,066;00:16:58,967;Tell me what she's saying.
173;00:16:59,001;00:17:01,503;The prince is riding.
174;00:17:01,537;00:17:04,538;I have heard the thunder
174;00:17:01,537;00:17:04,538;of his hooves.
175;00:17:04,573;00:17:06,974;Swift as the wind he rides.
176;00:17:08,409;00:17:11,278;His enemies
176;00:17:08,409;00:17:11,278;will cower before him...
177;00:17:12,746;00:17:16,249;And their wives will
177;00:17:12,746;00:17:16,249;weep tears of blood.
178;00:17:19,988;00:17:22,123;She's going
178;00:17:19,988;00:17:22,123;to have a boy.
179;00:17:24,860;00:17:27,496;He won't be
179;00:17:24,860;00:17:27,496;a real Targaryen.
180;00:17:27,530;00:17:29,932;He won't be
180;00:17:27,530;00:17:29,932;a true Dragon.
181;00:18:20,318;00:18:23,287;Vezh fin saja
181;00:18:20,318;00:18:23,287;rhaesheseres!
182;00:18:23,321;00:18:26,423;The stallion
182;00:18:23,321;00:18:26,423;who mounts the world.
183;00:18:26,458;00:18:29,460;The stallion is
183;00:18:26,458;00:18:29,460;the Khal of Khals.
184;00:18:29,494;00:18:32,596;He shall unite the people
184;00:18:29,494;00:18:32,596;into a single Khalasar.
185;00:18:32,631;00:18:35,999;All the people of the world
185;00:18:32,631;00:18:35,999;will be his herd.
186;00:18:36,034;00:18:38,235;...Rhaesheseres!
187;00:18:38,269;00:18:40,437;Rhaesheseres!
188;00:18:48,647;00:18:51,148;Rhaego! Rhaego!
189;00:18:51,182;00:18:53,317;Rhaego! Rhaego!
190;00:18:53,351;00:18:56,119;Rhaego!
190;00:18:53,351;00:18:56,119;Rhaego...
191;00:19:02,259;00:19:04,860;They love her.
192;00:19:07,463;00:19:08,696;Rhaego! Rhaego!
193;00:19:08,731;00:19:11,466;Rhaego!
193;00:19:08,731;00:19:11,466;Rhaego...
194;00:19:28,852;00:19:31,954;She truly is
194;00:19:28,852;00:19:31,954;a queen today.
195;00:20:00,248;00:20:03,751;Don't let them see you
195;00:20:00,248;00:20:03,751;carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak.
196;00:20:03,785;00:20:05,919;You know the law.
197;00:20:05,953;00:20:07,921;It's not my law.
198;00:20:07,955;00:20:09,924;They don't belong to you.
199;00:20:09,958;00:20:12,360;Whatever is hers
199;00:20:09,958;00:20:12,360;is also mine.
200;00:20:13,262;00:20:15,030;Once, perhaps.
201;00:20:16,966;00:20:19,802;If I sell one egg,
201;00:20:16,966;00:20:19,802;I'll have enough to buy a ship.
202;00:20:19,836;00:20:22,004;Two eggs-- a ship
202;00:20:19,836;00:20:22,004;and an army.
203;00:20:22,039;00:20:25,341;And you have all three.
203;00:20:22,039;00:20:25,341;I need a large army.
204;00:20:26,711;00:20:29,513;I'm the last hope
204;00:20:26,711;00:20:29,513;of a dynasty, Mormont.
205;00:20:29,547;00:20:31,682;The greatest dynasty
205;00:20:29,547;00:20:31,682;this world has ever seen
206;00:20:31,716;00:20:34,218;on my shoulders since
206;00:20:31,716;00:20:34,218;I was five years old--
207;00:20:34,252;00:20:37,254;and no one has ever given me
207;00:20:34,252;00:20:37,254;what they gave to her in that tent.
208;00:20:37,288;00:20:39,156;Never.
209;00:20:39,190;00:20:41,424;Not a piece of it.
210;00:20:41,459;00:20:44,127;How can I carry
210;00:20:41,459;00:20:44,127;what I need to carry without it?
211;00:20:44,161;00:20:45,862;Hmm?
212;00:20:45,896;00:20:48,330;Who can rule without wealth
212;00:20:45,896;00:20:48,330;or fear or love?
213;00:20:52,668;00:20:56,573;Oh, you stand there,
213;00:20:52,668;00:20:56,573;all nobility and honor.
214;00:20:59,610;00:21:02,446;You don't think I see you looking
214;00:20:59,610;00:21:02,446;at my little sister, hmm?
215;00:21:02,480;00:21:05,016;Don't think I know
215;00:21:02,480;00:21:05,016;what you want?
216;00:21:08,053;00:21:10,956;I don't care.
216;00:21:08,053;00:21:10,956;You can have her.
217;00:21:10,990;00:21:13,258;She can be Queen
217;00:21:10,990;00:21:13,258;of the savages and dine
218;00:21:13,293;00:21:15,227;on the finest
218;00:21:13,293;00:21:15,227;bloody horseparts,
219;00:21:15,261;00:21:18,063;and you can dine on whichever
219;00:21:15,261;00:21:18,063;parts of her you like.
220;00:21:19,398;00:21:21,733;But let me go.
221;00:21:23,902;00:21:25,403;You can go.
222;00:21:25,437;00:21:27,271;You can't have the eggs.
223;00:21:27,305;00:21:29,072;You swore
223;00:21:27,305;00:21:29,072;an oath to me.
224;00:21:29,107;00:21:31,608;Does loyalty
224;00:21:29,107;00:21:31,608;mean nothing to you?
225;00:21:31,642;00:21:33,810;It means everything to me.
226;00:21:33,844;00:21:35,845;And yet here you stand.
227;00:21:35,879;00:21:37,980;And yet here I stand.
228;00:21:53,931;00:21:56,533;Mord!
229;00:21:56,567;00:21:58,801;Mord!
230;00:22:01,204;00:22:03,072;Mord!
231;00:22:06,777;00:22:08,811;Mord!
232;00:22:09,813;00:22:11,614;Mord.
233;00:22:12,549;00:22:14,650;Noise again!
234;00:22:17,054;00:22:19,856;About the gold...
234;00:22:17,054;00:22:19,856;No gold!
235;00:22:19,891;00:22:22,326;No gold.
235;00:22:19,891;00:22:22,326;Listen to me!
236;00:22:22,360;00:22:24,428;Listen to me.
237;00:22:24,462;00:22:26,664;Sometimes possession
238;00:22:26,698;00:22:28,800;is an abstract concept--
239;00:22:30,837;00:22:33,372;When they captured me,
239;00:22:30,837;00:22:33,372;they took my purse,
240;00:22:33,406;00:22:35,374;but the gold
240;00:22:33,406;00:22:35,374;is still mine.
241;00:22:35,408;00:22:37,176;Where?
242;00:22:37,210;00:22:39,311;Where?
242;00:22:37,210;00:22:39,311;I don't know where,
243;00:22:39,345;00:22:40,645;but when they free me--
244;00:22:40,680;00:22:42,080;You want free?
245;00:22:43,015;00:22:45,350;Go be free.
246;00:22:46,618;00:22:48,786;Have you ever
246;00:22:46,618;00:22:48,786;heard the phrase
247;00:22:48,820;00:22:50,754;rich as a Lannister?
248;00:22:53,358;00:22:55,359;Of course you have!
249;00:22:55,393;00:22:58,329;You're a smart man.
250;00:22:58,363;00:23:01,199;You know who
250;00:22:58,363;00:23:01,199;the Lannisters are.
251;00:23:02,101;00:23:05,069;I am a Lannister.
252;00:23:05,104;00:23:08,773;Tyrion, son of Tywin!
253;00:23:08,808;00:23:12,879;And of course,
253;00:23:08,808;00:23:12,879;you have also heard the phrase,
254;00:23:12,913;00:23:16,249;a Lannister always
254;00:23:12,913;00:23:16,249;pays his debts.
255;00:23:18,052;00:23:20,620;If you deliver
255;00:23:18,052;00:23:20,620;a message from me...
256;00:23:21,722;00:23:25,091;to Lady Arryn,
256;00:23:21,722;00:23:25,091;I will be in your debt.
257;00:23:26,860;00:23:29,196;I will owe you gold.
258;00:23:30,565;00:23:32,699;If you deliver

259;00:23:32,734;00:23:36,570;and I live, which I very much
259;00:23:32,734;00:23:36,570;intend to do.
260;00:23:39,207;00:23:41,008;What message?
261;00:23:47,682;00:23:50,317;Tell her I wish
261;00:23:47,682;00:23:50,317;to confess my crimes.
262;00:23:56,692;00:23:59,727;You wish to confess
262;00:23:56,692;00:23:59,727;your crimes?
263;00:23:59,762;00:24:01,396;Yes, My Lady.
264;00:24:01,430;00:24:02,964;I do, My Lady.
265;00:24:02,998;00:24:06,334;The sky cells
265;00:24:02,998;00:24:06,334;always break them.
266;00:24:06,369;00:24:08,570;Speak, Imp.
267;00:24:08,605;00:24:11,006;Meet your gods
267;00:24:08,605;00:24:11,006;as an honest man.
268;00:24:15,811;00:24:19,448;Where do I begin,
268;00:24:15,811;00:24:19,448;my lords and ladies?
269;00:24:20,750;00:24:22,618;I'm a vile man,
270;00:24:22,652;00:24:24,553;I confess it.
271;00:24:24,587;00:24:27,589;My crimes and sins
271;00:24:24,587;00:24:27,589;are beyond counting.
272;00:24:27,624;00:24:30,759;I have lied
272;00:24:27,624;00:24:30,759;and cheated...
273;00:24:32,094;00:24:34,229;gambled and whored.
274;00:24:35,932;00:24:37,900;I'm not particularly
274;00:24:35,932;00:24:37,900;good at violence,
275;00:24:37,934;00:24:41,370;but I'm good at convincing
275;00:24:37,934;00:24:41,370;others to do violence for me.
276;00:24:44,008;00:24:46,142;You want specifics,
276;00:24:44,008;00:24:46,142;I suppose.
277;00:24:47,545;00:24:50,080;When I was seven
277;00:24:47,545;00:24:50,080;I saw a servant girl
278;00:24:50,114;00:24:52,082;bathing in the river.
279;00:24:52,117;00:24:53,984;I stole her robe.
280;00:24:54,018;00:24:56,352;She was forced to return
280;00:24:54,018;00:24:56,352;to the castle
281;00:24:56,387;00:24:58,387;naked and in tears.
282;00:24:59,990;00:25:01,723;If I close my eyes,
283;00:25:01,758;00:25:04,960;I can still see her tits bouncing.
284;00:25:07,229;00:25:11,465;When I was 10 I stuffed
284;00:25:07,229;00:25:11,465;my Uncle's boots with goatshit.
285;00:25:11,500;00:25:13,901;When confronted
285;00:25:11,500;00:25:13,901;with my crime,
286;00:25:13,935;00:25:16,404;I blamed a squire.
286;00:25:13,935;00:25:16,404;Poor boy was flogged
287;00:25:16,438;00:25:18,673;and I escaped justice.
288;00:25:18,707;00:25:20,475;When I was 12
289;00:25:20,509;00:25:23,511;I milked my eel
289;00:25:20,509;00:25:23,511;into a pot of turtle stew.
290;00:25:23,546;00:25:26,582;I flogged the one-eyed snake.
291;00:25:26,616;00:25:28,617;I skinned my sausage.
292;00:25:28,652;00:25:31,854;I made the bald man cry
293;00:25:31,889;00:25:33,890;into the turtle stew,
294;00:25:33,924;00:25:35,925;which I do believe
294;00:25:33,924;00:25:35,925;my sister ate.
295;00:25:35,959;00:25:37,894;At least I hope she did.
296;00:25:37,928;00:25:40,262;Once I brought a jackass
296;00:25:37,928;00:25:40,262;and a honeycomb
297;00:25:40,297;00:25:42,464;into a brothel--
297;00:25:40,297;00:25:42,464;Silence!
298;00:25:42,498;00:25:44,099;What happened next?
299;00:25:45,101;00:25:48,135;What do you think
299;00:25:45,101;00:25:48,135;you're doing?
300;00:25:48,170;00:25:50,104;Confessing my crimes.
301;00:25:50,138;00:25:52,673;Lord Tyrion,
301;00:25:50,138;00:25:52,673;you are accused
302;00:25:52,707;00:25:56,177;of hiring a man to slay
302;00:25:52,707;00:25:56,177;my son Bran in his bed,
303;00:25:56,211;00:25:59,014;and of conspiring to murder
303;00:25:56,211;00:25:59,014;my sister's husband
304;00:25:59,048;00:26:02,885;Lord Jon Arryn,
304;00:25:59,048;00:26:02,885;the Hand of the King.
305;00:26:02,919;00:26:05,254;Oh, I'm very sorry.
306;00:26:06,423;00:26:08,358;I don't know anything
306;00:26:06,423;00:26:08,358;about all that.
307;00:26:09,494;00:26:11,729;You've had
307;00:26:09,494;00:26:11,729;your little joke.
308;00:26:11,763;00:26:14,132;I trust you enjoyed it.
309;00:26:14,166;00:26:17,035;Mord, take him back
309;00:26:14,166;00:26:17,035;to the dungeon.
310;00:26:17,069;00:26:19,403;But this time find
310;00:26:17,069;00:26:19,403;a smaller cell...
311;00:26:19,438;00:26:21,539;With a steeper floor.
312;00:26:21,574;00:26:24,342;Is this how justice
313;00:26:24,376;00:26:26,244;is done in the Vale?
314;00:26:26,278;00:26:28,846;You accuse me
314;00:26:26,278;00:26:28,846;of crimes,
315;00:26:28,881;00:26:32,049;I deny them,
315;00:26:28,881;00:26:32,049;so you throw me into a cell
316;00:26:32,083;00:26:33,951;to freeze and starve?
317;00:26:33,985;00:26:36,921;Where is
317;00:26:33,985;00:26:36,921;the King's Justice?
318;00:26:36,955;00:26:40,325;I am accused
318;00:26:36,955;00:26:40,325;and demand a trial!
319;00:26:42,061;00:26:43,996;If you're tried
319;00:26:42,061;00:26:43,996;and found guilty,
320;00:26:44,030;00:26:47,133;then by the King's own laws
320;00:26:44,030;00:26:47,133;you will pay with your life.
321;00:26:47,167;00:26:50,270;I understand the law.
322;00:26:50,304;00:26:52,872;We have no executioner
322;00:26:50,304;00:26:52,872;in the Eyrie.
323;00:26:52,907;00:26:55,709;Life is more elegant here.
324;00:26:55,743;00:26:57,677;Open the moon door.
325;00:27:18,330;00:27:21,299;You want a trial,
325;00:27:18,330;00:27:21,299;My Lord Lannister.
326;00:27:21,333;00:27:23,334;Very well.
327;00:27:23,369;00:27:26,337;My son will listen
327;00:27:23,369;00:27:26,337;to whatever you have to say,
328;00:27:26,372;00:27:28,639;and you will hear
328;00:27:26,372;00:27:28,639;his judgment.
329;00:27:28,674;00:27:30,775;Then you will leave...
330;00:27:30,810;00:27:32,944;By one door
330;00:27:30,810;00:27:32,944;or the other.
331;00:27:32,978;00:27:36,180;No need to bother
331;00:27:32,978;00:27:36,180;Lord Robin.
332;00:27:36,215;00:27:39,851;I demand a trial by combat.
333;00:27:48,494;00:27:50,361;You have that right.
334;00:27:51,430;00:27:53,331;My Lady, I beg the honor.
335;00:27:53,365;00:27:55,333;Let me be your champion.
336;00:27:55,367;00:27:57,768;The honor should be mine.
337;00:27:57,803;00:28:00,037;For the love I bore
337;00:27:57,803;00:28:00,037;your Lord husband,
338;00:28:00,072;00:28:01,873;let me avenge his death.
339;00:28:01,907;00:28:04,442;I'll fight for you, My Lady.
339;00:28:01,907;00:28:04,442;It'll be my honor.
340;00:28:04,476;00:28:07,811;The honor should be mine.
340;00:28:04,476;00:28:07,811;Make the bad man fly!
341;00:28:09,080;00:28:11,782;Ser Vardis...
342;00:28:11,817;00:28:13,985;You're quiet.
343;00:28:14,019;00:28:15,919;Don't you want
343;00:28:14,019;00:28:15,919;to avenge my husband?
344;00:28:17,922;00:28:20,491;With all my heart,
344;00:28:17,922;00:28:20,491;My Lady.
345;00:28:20,525;00:28:22,459;But the Imp
345;00:28:20,525;00:28:22,459;is half my size.
346;00:28:22,494;00:28:25,628;It would be shameful to slaughter
346;00:28:22,494;00:28:25,628;such a man and call it justice.
347;00:28:25,663;00:28:27,731;Agreed.
348;00:28:27,765;00:28:30,700;You demanded
348;00:28:27,765;00:28:30,700;a trial by combat.
349;00:28:30,735;00:28:34,070;Now I demand a champion.
349;00:28:30,735;00:28:34,070;I have that right, same as you.
350;00:28:34,105;00:28:36,072;My Lady,
351;00:28:36,106;00:28:39,576;I will gladly fight
351;00:28:36,106;00:28:39,576;the Imp's champion for you.
352;00:28:39,610;00:28:42,112;I wouldn't be
352;00:28:39,610;00:28:42,112;too glad, Ser.
353;00:28:42,146;00:28:44,648;I name my brother
353;00:28:42,146;00:28:44,648;Jaime Lannister.
354;00:28:44,682;00:28:46,883;The Kingslayer
355;00:28:46,918;00:28:48,885;is hundreds of miles
355;00:28:46,918;00:28:48,885;from here.
356;00:28:48,919;00:28:51,521;Send a raven for him.
356;00:28:48,919;00:28:51,521;I'm happy to wait.
357;00:28:52,423;00:28:54,591;The trial will be today.
358;00:28:57,529;00:29:00,097;Do I have a volunteer?
359;00:29:07,907;00:29:10,475;Anyone?
360;00:29:10,510;00:29:12,511;Anyone?
361;00:29:15,448;00:29:17,749;I think we can assume
361;00:29:15,448;00:29:17,749;that no one is willing--
362;00:29:17,783;00:29:19,818;I'll stand
362;00:29:17,783;00:29:19,818;for the dwarf.
363;00:29:31,296;00:29:33,430;More wine, Your Grace?
364;00:29:35,333;00:29:37,868;What was I saying?
364;00:29:35,333;00:29:37,868;Renly: Simpler time.
365;00:29:37,903;00:29:41,239;It was! It was.
365;00:29:37,903;00:29:41,239;You're too young to remember.
366;00:29:41,273;00:29:42,974;Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?
367;00:29:43,009;00:29:46,478;It was, Your Grace.
367;00:29:43,009;00:29:46,478;The enemy was right  in the open,
368;00:29:46,513;00:29:50,716;vicious as you like, all but
368;00:29:46,513;00:29:50,716;sending you a bloody invitation.
369;00:29:50,751;00:29:52,719;Nothing like today.
370;00:29:52,753;00:29:55,621;It sounds exhilarating.
370;00:29:52,753;00:29:55,621;Exhilarating, yes.
371;00:29:55,655;00:29:58,023;Not as exhilarating
371;00:29:55,655;00:29:58,023;as those balls
372;00:29:58,058;00:30:00,459;and masquerades
372;00:29:58,058;00:30:00,459;you like to throw.
373;00:30:05,398;00:30:07,865;You ever fuck
373;00:30:05,398;00:30:07,865;a Riverlands girl?
374;00:30:07,899;00:30:09,533;Once.
374;00:30:07,899;00:30:09,533;I think.
375;00:30:09,567;00:30:13,370;You think?
375;00:30:09,567;00:30:13,370;I think you'd remember.
376;00:30:13,404;00:30:16,339;Back in our day,
376;00:30:13,404;00:30:16,339;you weren't a real man
377;00:30:16,374;00:30:19,476;until you'd fucked one girl
377;00:30:16,374;00:30:19,476;from each of the Seven Kingdoms
378;00:30:19,511;00:30:21,245;and the Riverlands.
379;00:30:21,279;00:30:24,515;We used to call it making the eight.
379;00:30:21,279;00:30:24,515;Those were some lucky girls.
380;00:30:24,549;00:30:26,584;You ever make
380;00:30:24,549;00:30:26,584;the eight, Barristan?
381;00:30:26,618;00:30:28,586;I don't believe so,
381;00:30:26,618;00:30:28,586;Your Grace.
382;00:30:28,620;00:30:30,488;Those were the days.
383;00:30:30,522;00:30:32,290;Which days, exactly?
384;00:30:32,324;00:30:35,827;The ones where half of Westeros
384;00:30:32,324;00:30:35,827;fought the other half and millions died?
385;00:30:35,861;00:30:39,097;Or before that, when the Mad King
385;00:30:35,861;00:30:39,097;slaughtered women and babies
386;00:30:39,131;00:30:42,033;because the voices in his head
386;00:30:39,131;00:30:42,033;told him they deserved it?
387;00:30:42,067;00:30:45,436;Or way before that, when dragons
387;00:30:42,067;00:30:45,436;burned whole cities to the ground?
388;00:30:45,470;00:30:47,638;Easy, boy.
389;00:30:47,673;00:30:50,641;You might be my brother,
389;00:30:47,673;00:30:50,641;but you're speaking to the King.
390;00:30:50,676;00:30:52,410;I suppose it was all
390;00:30:50,676;00:30:52,410;rather heroic...
391;00:30:52,444;00:30:55,279;If you were drunk enough
391;00:30:52,444;00:30:55,279;and had some poor Riverlands whore
392;00:30:55,313;00:30:57,948;to shove your prick inside
392;00:30:55,313;00:30:57,948;and make the eight.
393;00:31:02,054;00:31:03,922;More wine, Your Grace?
394;00:31:19,974;00:31:23,810;They burned most everything
394;00:31:19,974;00:31:23,810;in the Riverlands:
395;00:31:23,845;00:31:28,014;"Our fields;"
395;00:31:23,845;00:31:28,014;"Our granaries;"
396;00:31:28,048;00:31:30,450;our homes.
397;00:31:30,484;00:31:34,620;They took our women,
397;00:31:30,484;00:31:34,620;then they took 'em again.
398;00:31:34,655;00:31:37,256;When they was done,
398;00:31:34,655;00:31:37,256;they butchered them
399;00:31:37,291;00:31:39,092;as if they was animals.
400;00:31:39,126;00:31:41,261;They covered our children
401;00:31:41,296;00:31:43,097;in pitch
402;00:31:43,131;00:31:45,032;and lit them on fire.
403;00:31:46,201;00:31:48,202;Brigands, most likely.
404;00:31:48,237;00:31:50,606;They weren't thieves.
405;00:31:50,640;00:31:53,242;They didn't steal
405;00:31:50,640;00:31:53,242;nothing.
406;00:31:53,276;00:31:56,678;They even left something behind,
406;00:31:53,276;00:31:56,678;Your Grace.
407;00:31:56,713;00:32:00,115;It's the King's Hand
407;00:31:56,713;00:32:00,115;you're addressing, not the King.
408;00:32:00,149;00:32:02,083;The King is hunting.
409;00:32:09,157;00:32:13,394;Fish.
409;00:32:09,157;00:32:13,394;The Sigil of House Tully.
410;00:32:13,428;00:32:17,198;Isn't that your wife's house--
410;00:32:13,428;00:32:17,198;Tully, My Lord Hand?
411;00:32:21,836;00:32:25,272;These men,
411;00:32:21,836;00:32:25,272;were they flying a Sigil?
412;00:32:26,308;00:32:29,076;A banner?
412;00:32:26,308;00:32:29,076;None, your--
413;00:32:29,110;00:32:30,711;Hand.
414;00:32:30,745;00:32:32,579;The one who was
414;00:32:30,745;00:32:32,579;leading them...
415;00:32:32,614;00:32:36,117;Taller by a foot
415;00:32:32,614;00:32:36,117;than any man I've ever met,
416;00:32:36,151;00:32:39,487;saw him cut
416;00:32:36,151;00:32:39,487;the blacksmith in two,
417;00:32:39,521;00:32:41,922;saw him take the head
417;00:32:39,521;00:32:41,922;off a horse
418;00:32:41,957;00:32:44,459;with a single swing
418;00:32:41,957;00:32:44,459;of his sword.
419;00:32:44,493;00:32:47,028;That sounds like
419;00:32:44,493;00:32:47,028;someone we know.
420;00:32:47,062;00:32:49,164;The Mountain.
421;00:32:49,198;00:32:52,267;You're describing
421;00:32:49,198;00:32:52,267;Ser Gregor Clegane.
422;00:32:52,301;00:32:55,270;Why should Ser Gregor
422;00:32:52,301;00:32:55,270;turn brigand?
423;00:32:55,304;00:32:57,471;The man is
423;00:32:55,304;00:32:57,471;an anointed knight.
424;00:32:57,506;00:33:00,574;I've heard him called
424;00:32:57,506;00:33:00,574;Tywin Lannister's mad dog.
425;00:33:00,608;00:33:02,844;I'm sure you have
425;00:33:00,608;00:33:02,844;as well.
426;00:33:02,878;00:33:04,879;Can you think
426;00:33:02,878;00:33:04,879;of any reason
427;00:33:04,913;00:33:06,714;the Lannisters
427;00:33:04,913;00:33:06,714;might possibly have
428;00:33:06,748;00:33:08,416;for being angry
428;00:33:06,748;00:33:08,416;with your wife?
429;00:33:08,450;00:33:11,218;Maester Pycelle:
429;00:33:08,450;00:33:11,218;If the Lannisters
430;00:33:11,253;00:33:13,554;were to order attacks
430;00:33:11,253;00:33:13,554;on villages
431;00:33:13,588;00:33:15,823;under the King's
431;00:33:13,588;00:33:15,823;protection,
432;00:33:15,857;00:33:18,626;it would be--
432;00:33:15,857;00:33:18,626;That would be almost as brazen
433;00:33:18,660;00:33:21,695;as attacking the Hand of the King
433;00:33:18,660;00:33:21,695;in the streets of the capital.
434;00:33:21,730;00:33:24,132;Well...
435;00:33:27,904;00:33:30,272;I cannot give you
435;00:33:27,904;00:33:30,272;back your homes
436;00:33:30,306;00:33:33,008;or restore
436;00:33:30,306;00:33:33,008;your dead to life,
437;00:33:33,043;00:33:35,010;but perhaps I can
437;00:33:33,043;00:33:35,010;give you justice
438;00:33:35,045;00:33:37,679;in the name of our King,
438;00:33:35,045;00:33:37,679;Robert.

440;00:33:45,087;00:33:48,790;You shall have the command.
440;00:33:45,087;00:33:48,790;Assemble 100 men
441;00:33:48,824;00:33:52,527;and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.
441;00:33:48,824;00:33:52,527;As you command.
442;00:33:59,601;00:34:02,737;In the name of Robert
442;00:33:59,601;00:34:02,737;of the House Baratheon,
443;00:34:02,762;00:34:02,771;the first of his name,

446;00:34:08,946;00:34:11,180;I charge you to bring
446;00:34:08,946;00:34:11,180;the King's Justice
447;00:34:11,215;00:34:13,250;to the false knight
447;00:34:11,215;00:34:13,250;Gregor Clegane
448;00:34:13,284;00:34:15,752;and all those
448;00:34:13,284;00:34:15,752;who shared in his crimes.
449;00:34:15,787;00:34:17,688;I denounce him
450;00:34:17,722;00:34:19,690;and attaint him.
451;00:34:19,724;00:34:23,026;I strip him of all

452;00:34:23,061;00:34:26,729;of all lands and holdings,
453;00:34:26,764;00:34:30,133;and sentence him to death.

454;00:34:30,167;00:34:33,135;This-- this is
454;00:34:30,167;00:34:33,135;a drastic action.
455;00:34:33,170;00:34:35,938;It would be better to wait
455;00:34:33,170;00:34:35,938;for King Robert's return.
456;00:34:35,973;00:34:38,407;Grand Maester Pycelle.
456;00:34:35,973;00:34:38,407;My Lord.
457;00:34:38,442;00:34:40,811;Send a raven
457;00:34:38,442;00:34:40,811;to Casterly Rock.

459;00:34:44,216;00:34:46,283;to answer for the crimes
459;00:34:44,216;00:34:46,283;of his bannermen.
460;00:34:46,318;00:34:50,454;He will arrive within the fortnight
460;00:34:46,318;00:34:50,454;or be branded an enemy of the crown
461;00:34:50,488;00:34:54,158;and a traitor
461;00:34:50,488;00:34:54,158;to the realm.
462;00:35:07,273;00:35:10,142;A bold move, My Lord,
462;00:35:07,273;00:35:10,142;and admirable.
463;00:35:10,176;00:35:12,711;But is it wise
463;00:35:10,176;00:35:12,711;to yank the lion's tail?
464;00:35:12,746;00:35:16,248;Tywin Lannister is the richest man

466;00:35:20,353;00:35:22,688;Robert is King
467;00:35:22,722;00:35:25,024;and not Tywin Lannister?
468;00:35:57,458;00:36:01,061;Hold!
469;00:36:01,095;00:36:03,331;- Attack attack!
469;00:36:01,095;00:36:03,331;- Come on, Ser Vardis!
470;00:36:03,365;00:36:06,334;Attack!
471;00:36:09,571;00:36:12,139;Stand and fight, coward!
472;00:37:12,569;00:37:15,204;Yes!
473;00:37:17,207;00:37:20,877;Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him.
474;00:37:39,431;00:37:42,199;What are you doing?
474;00:37:39,431;00:37:42,199;Get up!
475;00:37:42,234;00:37:45,302;Get up, get up,
475;00:37:42,234;00:37:45,302;get up!
476;00:37:47,338;00:37:49,540;Raise your sword.
476;00:37:47,338;00:37:49,540;Raise it!
477;00:37:52,844;00:37:54,445;Get up, man!
478;00:37:54,479;00:37:56,180;On your feet!
478;00:37:54,479;00:37:56,180;Get up!
479;00:37:56,214;00:37:58,849;Get up and fight,
479;00:37:56,214;00:37:58,849;Ser Vardis!
480;00:38:12,796;00:38:15,631;No! Have mercy!
481;00:38:40,258;00:38:42,460;Is it over?
482;00:38:46,531;00:38:49,533;You don't fight
482;00:38:46,531;00:38:49,533;with honor!
483;00:38:51,970;00:38:53,804;No.
484;00:38:56,474;00:38:57,741;He did.
485;00:39:11,656;00:39:13,523;Can I make
485;00:39:11,656;00:39:13,523;the little man fly now?
486;00:39:13,558;00:39:15,492;Not this little man.

487;00:39:15,526;00:39:17,894;is going home.
488;00:39:19,998;00:39:21,998;I believe you have
488;00:39:19,998;00:39:21,998;something of mine.
489;00:39:41,953;00:39:44,822;A Lannister always

491;00:40:06,512;00:40:09,647;We're in the South.
492;00:40:09,682;00:40:13,018;It's important to remember where
492;00:40:09,682;00:40:13,018;you come from.
493;00:40:13,052;00:40:16,288;I'm not sure your mother would
493;00:40:13,052;00:40:16,288;like these new styles.
494;00:40:16,322;00:40:19,025;My mother isn't
494;00:40:16,322;00:40:19,025;from the North.
495;00:40:20,394;00:40:22,228;I'm aware of that.
496;00:40:22,262;00:40:24,063;Why do you care?
497;00:40:24,097;00:40:25,765;Do you even have hair
497;00:40:24,097;00:40:25,765;under there?
498;00:40:25,799;00:40:29,234;Yes.
498;00:40:25,799;00:40:29,234;I have hair.
499;00:40:29,269;00:40:31,037;I've never seen it.
500;00:40:31,071;00:40:33,205;Would you like to?
501;00:40:33,240;00:40:35,275;No.
502;00:40:37,178;00:40:39,846;Where are you from anyway?
502;00:40:37,178;00:40:39,846;The North or the South?
503;00:40:41,682;00:40:44,250;I come from a very
503;00:40:41,682;00:40:44,250;small village in--
504;00:40:44,285;00:40:45,552;Oh, wait.
505;00:40:45,586;00:40:48,021;I just realized
505;00:40:45,586;00:40:48,021;I don't care.
506;00:40:48,055;00:40:50,290;Sansa--
506;00:40:48,055;00:40:50,290;Septa.
507;00:40:50,324;00:40:53,760;Now you are being rude.
508;00:40:59,466;00:41:01,601;My prince.

511;00:41:08,743;00:41:11,077;I fear I have
511;00:41:08,743;00:41:11,077;behaved monstrously
512;00:41:11,112;00:41:13,980;the past few weeks.

516;00:41:35,367;00:41:37,334;You'll be queen someday.

522;00:41:57,958;00:42:01,894;the Seven Kingdoms will come,
523;00:42:01,928;00:42:04,196;from the last hearth
523;00:42:01,928;00:42:04,196;in the North
524;00:42:04,230;00:42:07,166;to the Salt Shore

525;00:42:07,200;00:42:10,436;and you will be Queen
525;00:42:07,200;00:42:10,436;over all of them.
526;00:42:13,673;00:42:16,107;I'll never

532;00:42:54,115;00:42:56,216;Stop.
533;00:42:56,251;00:42:58,819;Stop!
533;00:42:56,251;00:42:58,819;Whoa.
534;00:43:00,221;00:43:02,755;What are you doing?
534;00:43:00,221;00:43:02,755;Going to King's Landing.
535;00:43:02,790;00:43:04,891;In a turnip cart?
536;00:43:04,925;00:43:07,927;I'll find a ship heading
536;00:43:04,925;00:43:07,927;south in White Harbor.
537;00:43:08,995;00:43:10,796;And you can afford that?
538;00:43:10,830;00:43:13,531;Some of my friends are more
538;00:43:10,830;00:43:13,531;generous than others.
539;00:43:13,566;00:43:16,234;There's a thousand
539;00:43:13,566;00:43:16,234;girls like you in King's Landing.
540;00:43:16,269;00:43:18,536;So I'll have
540;00:43:16,269;00:43:18,536;lots of company.
541;00:43:18,571;00:43:20,272;Yes, you'll be
541;00:43:18,571;00:43:20,272;very popular...
542;00:43:20,306;00:43:22,007;Until some fat lord
542;00:43:20,306;00:43:22,007;comes to visit
543;00:43:22,042;00:43:23,909;with a big belly
543;00:43:22,042;00:43:23,909;and a little prick
544;00:43:23,944;00:43:26,446;and he can't get it up
544;00:43:23,944;00:43:26,446;so he knocks all your teeth out.
545;00:43:26,480;00:43:29,349;And what will happen
545;00:43:26,480;00:43:29,349;to me if I stay here?
546;00:43:29,383;00:43:31,318;Will I become
546;00:43:29,383;00:43:31,318;Lady Greyjoy,

547;00:43:31,352;00:43:34,422;Don't be a fool.
548;00:43:34,456;00:43:36,590;I hear Jaime Lannister

549;00:43:36,625;00:43:38,392;in the streets
549;00:43:36,625;00:43:38,392;of King's Landing.
550;00:43:38,427;00:43:42,296;Every man for a hundred miles will be

551;00:43:42,330;00:43:44,297;and most of them
551;00:43:42,330;00:43:44,297;will never come back.
552;00:43:44,332;00:43:46,333;There's nothing left
552;00:43:44,332;00:43:46,333;for me here.
553;00:43:47,601;00:43:49,669;Let's go, Stefon.
554;00:43:49,703;00:43:51,170;Giddyup.
555;00:43:51,204;00:43:53,472;Let me see it
555;00:43:51,204;00:43:53,472;one more time!
556;00:43:53,506;00:43:55,807;See what?
557;00:44:07,219;00:44:09,320;I'm going to miss you.
558;00:44:09,355;00:44:11,222;I know.
559;00:44:25,002;00:44:27,037;I'm sending you both
559;00:44:25,002;00:44:27,037;back to Winterfell.
560;00:44:27,071;00:44:28,471;What?!
560;00:44:27,071;00:44:28,471;Listen--
561;00:44:28,505;00:44:31,107;What about Joffrey?
561;00:44:28,505;00:44:31,107;Are you dying because of your leg?
562;00:44:31,141;00:44:32,420;Is that why
562;00:44:31,141;00:44:32,420;you're sending us home?
563;00:44:32,445;00:44:33,609;What? No.
564;00:44:33,610;00:44:35,044;Please, father.
564;00:44:33,610;00:44:35,044;Please don't.
565;00:44:35,078;00:44:37,246;You can't.
565;00:44:35,078;00:44:37,246;I've got my lessons with Syrio.
566;00:44:37,280;00:44:38,881;I'm finally
566;00:44:37,280;00:44:38,881;getting good.
567;00:44:38,915;00:44:41,350;This isn't
567;00:44:38,915;00:44:41,350;a punishment.
568;00:44:41,384;00:44:43,786;I want you back in Winterfell
568;00:44:41,384;00:44:43,786;for your own safety.

570;00:44:45,289;00:44:46,860;Who cares about your
570;00:44:45,289;00:44:46,860;stupid dancing teacher?
571;00:44:46,885;00:44:48,185;I can't go.
572;00:44:48,192;00:44:50,060;I'm supposed to marry

573;00:44:50,094;00:44:51,996;I love him and I'm meant

574;00:44:52,030;00:44:54,632;and have his babies.

578;00:45:01,773;00:45:05,043;I don't want someone brave
578;00:45:01,773;00:45:05,043;and gentle and strong. I want him!
579;00:45:05,077;00:45:07,846;He'll be the greatest

580;00:45:07,880;00:45:10,648;and I'll give him
580;00:45:07,880;00:45:10,648;sons with beautiful blond hair.

583;00:45:15,187;00:45:18,089;He's nothing like that old drunk King.

584;00:45:21,293;00:45:24,129;packing your things.
