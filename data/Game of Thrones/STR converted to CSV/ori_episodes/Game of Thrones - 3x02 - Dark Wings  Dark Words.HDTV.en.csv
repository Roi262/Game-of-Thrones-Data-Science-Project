143;00:10:10,575;00:10:12,209;Meaning no offense,
143;00:10:10,575;00:10:12,209;my lady, but...
144;00:10:12,243;00:10:14,644;( laughs ) I wouldn't
144;00:10:12,243;00:10:14,644;tangle with you.
145;00:10:14,679;00:10:16,513;( laughs )
146;00:10:16,547;00:10:18,715;Seven blessings to you.
146;00:10:16,547;00:10:18,715;And you.
147;00:10:25,889;00:10:27,823;Jaime:
147;00:10:25,889;00:10:27,823;He knows who I am.
148;00:10:27,857;00:10:29,291;He doesn't.
148;00:10:27,857;00:10:29,291;Maybe you're right.
149;00:10:29,325;00:10:32,060;But what if you're not?
149;00:10:29,325;00:10:32,060;What if he tells someone?
150;00:10:34,564;00:10:36,966;We're not doing it.
151;00:10:37,000;00:10:39,235;He's an innocent man.
152;00:10:39,269;00:10:41,804;More innocent than
152;00:10:39,269;00:10:41,804;Lady Stark's daughters?
153;00:10:53,448;00:10:55,616;Make it tighter here.
154;00:10:56,718;00:10:58,318;That's better.
155;00:10:59,687;00:11:01,354;It makes you look very strong.
156;00:11:01,389;00:11:03,390;No flowers.
157;00:11:03,424;00:11:05,525;I said no flowers.
158;00:11:07,061;00:11:09,028;All these are wrong.
158;00:11:07,061;00:11:09,028;Bring others.
159;00:11:09,062;00:11:11,030;Yes, Your Grace.
160;00:11:12,198;00:11:14,000;Bloody flowers.
161;00:11:14,034;00:11:16,034;On the king.
162;00:11:16,069;00:11:18,437;Looks like a Tyrell rose.
163;00:11:18,471;00:11:21,306;Give it to Margaery
163;00:11:18,471;00:11:21,306;for her wedding gown.
164;00:11:21,340;00:11:23,875;Should be more
164;00:11:21,340;00:11:23,875;than enough fabric.
165;00:11:28,880;00:11:30,781;Tell me what you think of her.
166;00:11:30,815;00:11:32,016;Who?
167;00:11:32,050;00:11:34,085;Margaery.
168;00:11:34,119;00:11:36,020;She's an ideal match.
169;00:11:36,054;00:11:37,989;With the Tyrells beside us,
170;00:11:38,023;00:11:40,225;we'll crush the Northerners.
171;00:11:40,259;00:11:43,428;Hang their lords,
171;00:11:40,259;00:11:43,428;burn their strongholds,
172;00:11:43,462;00:11:44,996;sow their fields with salt,
173;00:11:45,030;00:11:48,132;and no one will think of
173;00:11:45,030;00:11:48,132;rebelling for another century.
174;00:11:49,568;00:11:52,770;It is a good match, but
174;00:11:49,568;00:11:52,770;what do you think of her?
175;00:11:56,373;00:11:58,842;She's beautiful
175;00:11:56,373;00:11:58,842;and intelligent.
176;00:11:58,876;00:12:00,644;Yes, she is.
177;00:12:00,678;00:12:04,448;Her concern with the well-being of
177;00:12:00,678;00:12:04,448;the common people is interesting.
178;00:12:04,515;00:12:06,984;Not to me.
179;00:12:07,018;00:12:08,519;( chuckles )
180;00:12:08,553;00:12:10,955;I only meant that to go out of
180;00:12:08,553;00:12:10,955;your way to endanger yourself--
181;00:12:10,989;00:12:13,291;This is becoming
181;00:12:10,989;00:12:13,291;one of the most boring
182;00:12:13,325;00:12:15,760;conversations I've ever had.
183;00:12:19,098;00:12:23,001;Margaery Tyrell dotes on
183;00:12:19,098;00:12:23,001;filthy urchins for a reason.
184;00:12:23,035;00:12:26,469;She dresses like
184;00:12:23,035;00:12:26,469;a harlot for a reason.
185;00:12:26,504;00:12:28,803;She married a traitor
185;00:12:26,504;00:12:28,803;and known degenerate
186;00:12:28,836;00:12:30,157;like Renly Baratheon
186;00:12:28,836;00:12:30,157;for a reason.
187;00:12:30,171;00:12:33,740;She married Renly Baratheon
187;00:12:30,171;00:12:33,740;because she was told to.
188;00:12:33,774;00:12:36,442;That's what
188;00:12:33,774;00:12:36,442;intelligent women do--
189;00:12:36,476;00:12:38,311;what they're told.
190;00:12:41,515;00:12:45,116;You need to ask yourself--
190;00:12:41,515;00:12:45,116;I don't need to do anything.
191;00:12:55,226;00:12:56,626;( sighs )
192;00:12:56,660;00:12:58,427;Better.
193;00:12:59,861;00:13:01,628;Much better.
194;00:13:01,663;00:13:03,997;I still don't believe it.
195;00:13:04,031;00:13:05,765;He didn't.
195;00:13:04,031;00:13:05,765;He didn't want anything.
196;00:13:05,799;00:13:09,468;He just takes an interest
196;00:13:05,799;00:13:09,468;because he loved my mother.
197;00:13:11,304;00:13:14,439;Men only want one thing
197;00:13:11,304;00:13:14,439;from a pretty girl.
198;00:13:16,408;00:13:19,609;Littlefinger's not
198;00:13:16,408;00:13:19,609;in love with me.
199;00:13:21,211;00:13:24,179;Love is not the thing he wants.
200;00:13:26,114;00:13:27,615;He's too old.
201;00:13:27,649;00:13:29,817;They never see it that way.
202;00:13:33,353;00:13:36,655;He didn't ask you
202;00:13:33,353;00:13:36,655;to do something for him?
203;00:13:36,690;00:13:38,890;Spy on someone or...?
204;00:13:38,925;00:13:40,793;No.
205;00:13:46,532;00:13:49,134;If he does ask you for anything
206;00:13:49,168;00:13:51,136;or try anything
207;00:13:51,204;00:13:54,506;or touch you,
207;00:13:51,204;00:13:54,506;I want you to tell me.
208;00:13:55,709;00:13:58,177;Why?
208;00:13:55,709;00:13:58,177;What will you do?
209;00:13:58,211;00:13:59,845;I will make him stop.
210;00:13:59,880;00:14:02,248;( knocks )
211;00:14:02,282;00:14:03,983;Guard:
211;00:14:02,282;00:14:03,983;Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.
212;00:14:04,016;00:14:06,484;Send him in.
213;00:14:15,495;00:14:17,162;Lady Sansa.
214;00:14:17,230;00:14:18,563;Ser Loras.
215;00:14:18,598;00:14:19,865;My sister Margaery
215;00:14:18,598;00:14:19,865;invites you to take
216;00:14:19,899;00:14:21,300;the air with her
216;00:14:19,899;00:14:21,300;and our grandmother
217;00:14:21,334;00:14:23,702;the Lady Olenna in the gardens.
218;00:14:23,736;00:14:26,438;May I escort you to them?
219;00:14:32,945;00:14:35,947;I believe you grow more beautiful
219;00:14:32,945;00:14:35,947;every day, Lady Sansa.
220;00:14:35,980;00:14:38,148;You are too kind, Ser Loras.
221;00:14:40,952;00:14:44,121;You probably don't remember
221;00:14:40,952;00:14:44,121;the first time we met.
222;00:14:45,523;00:14:48,526;At the Hand's tourney,
222;00:14:45,523;00:14:48,526;you gave me your favor.
223;00:14:49,762;00:14:52,463;A rose, a red rose.
224;00:14:52,498;00:14:54,165;Of course I did.
225;00:14:56,869;00:14:58,636;Margaery:
225;00:14:56,869;00:14:58,636;It's more your color.
226;00:14:58,671;00:15:01,406;You take it.
226;00:14:58,671;00:15:01,406;Thank you.
227;00:15:01,441;00:15:03,308;You're such a dear.
228;00:15:03,343;00:15:05,377;I'll take my leave.
229;00:15:05,411;00:15:07,179;Lady Sansa.
230;00:15:07,212;00:15:09,381;Thank you, Ser Loras.
231;00:15:09,415;00:15:11,383;Come.
232;00:15:17,858;00:15:19,825;Lady Sansa, it is my honor
233;00:15:19,860;00:15:22,027;to present my grandmother...
234;00:15:23,196;00:15:25,564;the Lady Olenna
234;00:15:23,196;00:15:25,564;of House Tyrell.
235;00:15:25,599;00:15:27,600;Kiss me, child.
236;00:15:27,668;00:15:29,669;It's so good of you to visit me
237;00:15:29,703;00:15:31,571;and my foolish flock of hens.
238;00:15:31,605;00:15:33,974;We're very sorry
238;00:15:31,605;00:15:33,974;for your losses.
239;00:15:34,008;00:15:37,677;And I was sorry when I heard of
239;00:15:34,008;00:15:37,677;Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery.
240;00:15:37,711;00:15:39,912;He was very gallant.
240;00:15:37,711;00:15:39,912;Gallant, yes.
241;00:15:39,946;00:15:42,181;And charming and very clean.
242;00:15:42,249;00:15:44,116;He knew how to dress and smile
243;00:15:44,151;00:15:46,986;and somehow this gave him the
243;00:15:44,151;00:15:46,986;notion he was fit to be king.
244;00:15:47,020;00:15:49,021;Renly was brave
244;00:15:47,020;00:15:49,021;and gentle, Grandmother.
245;00:15:49,056;00:15:50,723;Father liked him
245;00:15:49,056;00:15:50,723;and so did Loras.
246;00:15:50,757;00:15:52,392;Loras is young and very good
247;00:15:52,426;00:15:54,361;at knocking men
247;00:15:52,426;00:15:54,361;off horses with a stick.
248;00:15:54,395;00:15:57,063;That does not make him wise.
249;00:15:57,098;00:15:58,465;As to your
249;00:15:57,098;00:15:58,465;fathead father--
250;00:15:58,499;00:16:01,301;Grandmother! What will
250;00:15:58,499;00:16:01,301;Sansa think of us?
251;00:16:01,335;00:16:03,736;She might think we have
251;00:16:01,335;00:16:03,736;some wits about us.
252;00:16:03,771;00:16:05,471;One of us, at any rate.
253;00:16:05,539;00:16:08,241;It was treason.
253;00:16:05,539;00:16:08,241;I warned them.
254;00:16:08,309;00:16:11,211;Robert has two sons and
254;00:16:08,309;00:16:11,211;Renly has an older brother.
255;00:16:11,244;00:16:13,345;How could he possibly
255;00:16:11,244;00:16:13,345;have any claim
256;00:16:13,380;00:16:15,981;to that ugly iron chair?
257;00:16:16,015;00:16:19,051;We should have stayed well out
257;00:16:16,015;00:16:19,051;of all this if you ask me.
258;00:16:19,085;00:16:20,953;But once the cow's been milked,
259;00:16:20,988;00:16:23,556;there's no squirting
259;00:16:20,988;00:16:23,556;the cream back up her udders.
260;00:16:23,590;00:16:25,626;So here we are
260;00:16:23,590;00:16:25,626;to see things through.
261;00:16:25,660;00:16:28,263;What do you say to that, Sansa?
262;00:16:29,398;00:16:31,333;Shall we have some lemon cakes?
263;00:16:31,367;00:16:32,934;Lemon cake's my favorite.
264;00:16:32,969;00:16:35,103;So we've been told.
265;00:16:35,138;00:16:38,640;Are you going to bring the food or
265;00:16:35,138;00:16:38,640;do you mean to starve us to death?
266;00:16:39,542;00:16:41,476;Here, Sansa,
267;00:16:41,509;00:16:43,611;come sit with me.
268;00:16:43,645;00:16:47,081;I'm much less boring
268;00:16:43,645;00:16:47,081;than these others.
269;00:16:49,251;00:16:51,853;Do you know my son?
270;00:16:51,887;00:16:53,721;The Lord of Highgarden?
271;00:16:53,756;00:16:55,957;I haven't had the pleasure.
272;00:16:56,025;00:16:57,959;No great pleasure, believe me.
273;00:16:57,993;00:16:59,494;A ponderous oaf.
274;00:16:59,528;00:17:01,529;His father was an oaf as well.
275;00:17:01,564;00:17:04,332;My husband,
275;00:17:01,564;00:17:04,332;the late Lord Luthor.
276;00:17:04,367;00:17:07,268;He managed to ride off
276;00:17:04,367;00:17:07,268;a cliff whilst hawking.
277;00:17:07,303;00:17:09,471;They say he was looking
277;00:17:07,303;00:17:09,471;up at the sky
278;00:17:09,505;00:17:13,008;and paying no mind to where
278;00:17:09,505;00:17:13,008;his horse was taking him.
279;00:17:13,041;00:17:15,042;And now my son
279;00:17:13,041;00:17:15,042;is doing the same,
280;00:17:15,076;00:17:18,746;only this time he's riding
280;00:17:15,076;00:17:18,746;a lion instead of a horse.
281;00:17:18,781;00:17:21,349;Now...
282;00:17:21,417;00:17:23,752;I want you to tell me the truth
283;00:17:23,787;00:17:27,723;about this royal boy,
283;00:17:23,787;00:17:27,723;this Joffrey.
284;00:17:27,757;00:17:29,925;I... I...
285;00:17:29,960;00:17:31,394;You, you.
286;00:17:31,428;00:17:33,162;Who else would know better?
287;00:17:33,197;00:17:35,999;We've heard
287;00:17:33,197;00:17:35,999;some troubling tales.
288;00:17:36,033;00:17:38,768;Is there any truth to them?
289;00:17:38,802;00:17:41,204;Has this boy mistreated you?
290;00:17:41,238;00:17:43,573;Has he ripped out your tongue?
291;00:17:43,608;00:17:46,042;Joff-- King Joffrey,
292;00:17:46,075;00:17:49,311;he-- His Grace
292;00:17:46,075;00:17:49,311;is very fair
293;00:17:49,345;00:17:52,414;and handsome
293;00:17:49,345;00:17:52,414;and as brave as a lion.
294;00:17:52,448;00:17:55,050;Yes, all Lannisters are lions.
295;00:17:55,084;00:17:58,787;And when a Tyrell farts,
295;00:17:55,084;00:17:58,787;it smells like a rose.
296;00:17:58,821;00:18:01,089;But how kind is he?
296;00:17:58,821;00:18:01,089;How clever?
297;00:18:01,123;00:18:03,625;Has he a good heart,
297;00:18:01,123;00:18:03,625;a gentle hand?
298;00:18:03,659;00:18:05,093;I'm to be his wife.
299;00:18:05,127;00:18:07,328;I only want to know
299;00:18:05,127;00:18:07,328;what that means.
300;00:18:08,263;00:18:10,531;( footsteps approaching )
301;00:18:14,903;00:18:16,671;Bring me some cheese.
302;00:18:16,704;00:18:19,072;The cheese will be served
302;00:18:16,704;00:18:19,072;after the cakes, my lady.
303;00:18:19,139;00:18:21,407;The cheese will be served
303;00:18:19,139;00:18:21,407;when I want it served.
304;00:18:21,442;00:18:23,009;And I want it served now.
305;00:18:27,114;00:18:29,215;Are you frightened, child?
306;00:18:29,283;00:18:31,150;No need for that.
307;00:18:31,184;00:18:33,085;We're only women here.
308;00:18:33,120;00:18:36,422;Tell us the truth.
308;00:18:33,120;00:18:36,422;No harm will come to you.
309;00:18:37,491;00:18:40,459;My father always
309;00:18:37,491;00:18:40,459;told the truth.
310;00:18:40,494;00:18:42,561;Yes, he had that reputation.
311;00:18:42,596;00:18:45,030;And they named him traitor
311;00:18:42,596;00:18:45,030;and took his head.
312;00:18:45,065;00:18:47,967;Joffrey.
313;00:18:48,000;00:18:49,901;Joffrey did that.
314;00:18:49,936;00:18:53,305;He promised he would be merciful
314;00:18:49,936;00:18:53,305;and he cut my father's head off.
315;00:18:53,339;00:18:55,140;And he said that was mercy.
316;00:18:55,175;00:18:59,010;Then he took me up on the
316;00:18:55,175;00:18:59,010;walls and made me look at it.
317;00:19:02,648;00:19:05,050;Go on.
318;00:19:06,085;00:19:09,187;I-- I can't.
318;00:19:06,085;00:19:09,187;I never meant--
319;00:19:09,221;00:19:11,423;my father was a traitor.
320;00:19:11,457;00:19:13,892;My brother as well.
320;00:19:11,457;00:19:13,892;I have traitor's blood.
321;00:19:13,926;00:19:15,594;Please don't make me
321;00:19:13,926;00:19:15,594;say anymore.
322;00:19:15,628;00:19:17,128;She's terrified, Grandmother.
323;00:19:17,163;00:19:20,599;Just look at her.
323;00:19:17,163;00:19:20,599;Speak freely, child.
324;00:19:20,632;00:19:24,435;We would never betray your
324;00:19:20,632;00:19:24,435;confidence, I swear it.
325;00:19:26,671;00:19:29,306;He's a monster.
326;00:19:30,542;00:19:32,309;Ah.
327;00:19:32,344;00:19:34,278;That's a pity.
328;00:19:34,346;00:19:36,714;Please, don't stop the wedding.
329;00:19:36,748;00:19:39,416;Have no fear.
329;00:19:36,748;00:19:39,416;The Lord Oaf of Highgarden
330;00:19:39,450;00:19:42,285;is determined that

331;00:19:42,320;00:19:45,789;Even so, we thank you
331;00:19:42,320;00:19:45,789;for the truth.
332;00:19:45,823;00:19:48,625;Ah, here comes my cheese.

334;00:20:04,375;00:20:05,841;Karstark:
334;00:20:04,375;00:20:05,841;We're at war.
335;00:20:05,876;00:20:08,411;This march is a distraction.
336;00:20:08,445;00:20:11,614;My grandfather's funeral
336;00:20:08,445;00:20:11,614;is not a distraction.
337;00:20:11,648;00:20:14,617;Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
337;00:20:11,648;00:20:14,617;No.
338;00:20:14,651;00:20:16,685;Then it's a distraction.
339;00:20:16,720;00:20:19,788;My Uncle Edmure has his
339;00:20:16,720;00:20:19,788;forces garrisoned there.
340;00:20:19,823;00:20:21,690;We need his men.
341;00:20:21,724;00:20:24,026;Unless he's been breeding them,
342;00:20:24,059;00:20:26,027;he don't have enough
342;00:20:24,059;00:20:26,027;to make a difference.
343;00:20:26,061;00:20:28,663;Have you lost faith
343;00:20:26,061;00:20:28,663;in our cause?
344;00:20:28,697;00:20:32,300;If it's revenge,
344;00:20:28,697;00:20:32,300;I still got faith in it.
345;00:20:32,334;00:20:34,201;If you no longer
345;00:20:32,334;00:20:34,201;believe--
346;00:20:34,236;00:20:36,870;I can believe
346;00:20:34,236;00:20:36,870;till it snows in Dorne.
347;00:20:36,905;00:20:40,508;Don't change the fact
347;00:20:36,905;00:20:40,508;that we've got half the men.
348;00:20:42,143;00:20:44,912;You don't think we can win?
349;00:20:44,946;00:20:47,081;May I speak my mind,

356;00:21:10,305;00:21:12,907;You're afraid of her.
357;00:21:12,942;00:21:15,644;And she knows it.
357;00:21:12,942;00:21:15,644;I'm not afraid of her.

360;00:21:27,922;00:21:29,523;No.
361;00:21:30,525;00:21:32,059;I'm sorry,
361;00:21:30,525;00:21:32,059;I shouldn't have--
362;00:21:32,127;00:21:33,594;You can't help because a mother
363;00:21:33,628;00:21:36,798;makes one for her
363;00:21:33,628;00:21:36,798;children to protect them.
364;00:21:38,534;00:21:40,735;Only a mother can make them.
365;00:21:47,475;00:21:49,676;You've made them before?
366;00:21:51,112;00:21:53,379;Twice.
367;00:21:53,414;00:21:55,548;Did they work?
368;00:21:57,785;00:21:59,719;After a fashion.
369;00:22:02,221;00:22:05,991;I prayed for my son Bran
369;00:22:02,221;00:22:05,991;to survive his fall.
370;00:22:10,096;00:22:11,697;Many years before that,
371;00:22:11,731;00:22:14,233;one of the boys came down
371;00:22:11,731;00:22:14,233;with the pox.
372;00:22:16,036;00:22:18,438;Maester Luwin said if he made it
372;00:22:16,036;00:22:18,438;through the night, he'd live.
373;00:22:18,472;00:22:22,275;But it would be
373;00:22:18,472;00:22:22,275;a very long night.
374;00:22:24,712;00:22:28,215;So I sat with him
374;00:22:24,712;00:22:28,215;all through the darkness.
375;00:22:29,417;00:22:32,753;Listened to his ragged
375;00:22:29,417;00:22:32,753;little breaths,
376;00:22:32,786;00:22:35,622;his coughing, his whimpering.
377;00:22:35,656;00:22:37,757;Which boy?
378;00:22:38,692;00:22:40,927;Jon Snow.
379;00:22:43,164;00:22:45,565;When my husband brought
379;00:22:43,164;00:22:45,565;that baby home from the war,
380;00:22:45,600;00:22:48,068;I couldn't bear to look at him.
381;00:22:49,237;00:22:50,537;I didn't want
381;00:22:49,237;00:22:50,537;to see those brown
382;00:22:50,572;00:22:53,841;stranger's eyes
382;00:22:50,572;00:22:53,841;staring up at me.
383;00:22:53,909;00:22:56,812;So I prayed to the gods,
383;00:22:53,909;00:22:56,812;take him away.
384;00:22:56,846;00:22:59,347;Make him die.
385;00:23:01,517;00:23:03,317;He got the pox.
386;00:23:05,987;00:23:10,391;And I knew I was the worst
386;00:23:05,987;00:23:10,391;woman who ever lived.
387;00:23:12,293;00:23:14,428;A murderer.
388;00:23:15,831;00:23:18,699;I'd condemned this poor,
388;00:23:15,831;00:23:18,699;innocent child
389;00:23:18,733;00:23:21,168;to a horrible death
390;00:23:21,202;00:23:23,737;all because I was
390;00:23:21,202;00:23:23,737;jealous of his mother.
391;00:23:24,773;00:23:27,174;A woman he didn't even know.
392;00:23:27,209;00:23:30,378;So I prayed to all seven gods,
393;00:23:30,412;00:23:33,581;let the boy live.
394;00:23:33,614;00:23:36,049;Let him live
395;00:23:36,084;00:23:38,117;and I'll love him.
396;00:23:38,152;00:23:41,454;I'll be a mother to him.
397;00:23:41,489;00:23:45,225;I'll beg my husband
397;00:23:41,489;00:23:45,225;to give him a true name,
398;00:23:45,260;00:23:48,195;to call him Stark
398;00:23:45,260;00:23:48,195;and be done with it,
399;00:23:48,230;00:23:49,797;to make him one of us.
400;00:23:49,831;00:23:52,099;And he lived.
401;00:23:52,133;00:23:53,935;And he lived.
402;00:23:56,838;00:23:59,273;And I couldn't keep my promise.
403;00:24:03,712;00:24:06,347;And everything
403;00:24:03,712;00:24:06,347;that's happened since then...
404;00:24:08,149;00:24:11,151;all this horror
404;00:24:08,149;00:24:11,151;that's come to my family...
405;00:24:13,387;00:24:17,424;it's all because I couldn't
405;00:24:13,387;00:24:17,424;love a motherless child.
406;00:24:27,869;00:24:30,705;Was it hard for you

409;00:24:36,978;00:24:39,646;I like you, but if

410;00:24:39,681;00:24:41,615;it won't be hard
410;00:24:39,681;00:24:41,615;for me to kill you.

415;00:24:51,760;00:24:54,928;Do you know what it takes
415;00:24:51,760;00:24:54,928;to unite 90 clans,

416;00:24:54,963;00:24:57,231;to massacre the other half
417;00:24:57,265;00:24:59,667;for one insult or another?

574;00:35:06,097;00:35:07,898;They'll bring us back
574;00:35:06,097;00:35:07,898;and put rats in us.

592;00:36:27,040;00:36:28,841;Did anyone see you?

599;00:36:48,295;00:36:50,396;I'm worried about Sansa.

618;00:37:47,052;00:37:48,786;That Sansa shouldn't trust him.

627;00:38:11,175;00:38:14,244;Yes, she is, objectively, very.

685;00:41:30,536;00:41:32,871;He never wanted to try.
686;00:41:34,239;00:41:37,007;Except one evening,
687;00:41:37,041;00:41:39,843;after he'd had far too

688;00:41:39,878;00:41:42,346;he suggested something--
689;00:41:45,817;00:41:49,386;something that sounded
689;00:41:45,817;00:41:49,386;very painful
690;00:41:49,453;00:41:51,521;and couldn't possibly
690;00:41:49,453;00:41:51,521;result in children.
691;00:41:53,658;00:41:55,458;Maybe the fault was with me.

790;00:47:27,379;00:47:29,314;Isn't he ashamed, your brother,

847;00:50:32,293;00:50:34,061;But before you go,
848;00:50:34,095;00:50:37,363;allow me to raise
848;00:50:34,095;00:50:37,363;a cup to your--
849;00:50:37,398;00:50:39,966;Hey, hey.

850;00:50:40,000;00:50:42,702;Now that is an uncommonly
850;00:50:40,000;00:50:42,702;large person.
851;00:50:42,737;00:50:44,271;How does one manage to subdue
852;00:50:44,305;00:50:46,072;such an uncommonly
852;00:50:44,305;00:50:46,072;large person?
853;00:50:46,106;00:50:48,808;One waits for him to drink
853;00:50:46,106;00:50:48,808;until he passes out.
854;00:50:48,843;00:50:51,644;Poor man.
854;00:50:48,843;00:50:51,644;You have my sympathy.
855;00:50:53,614;00:50:56,949;Aha, not a man at all.
856;00:50:58,085;00:51:01,053;A Hound!
856;00:50:58,085;00:51:01,053;( men howl and bark )
857;00:51:01,121;00:51:03,689;So good to see

858;00:51:03,723;00:51:05,690;Thoros?
859;00:51:05,725;00:51:08,126;The fuck you doing here?
860;00:51:08,160;00:51:10,061;Drinking and talking too much.
861;00:51:10,096;00:51:12,097;Same as ever.
861;00:51:10,096;00:51:12,097;( men laugh )
862;00:51:12,131;00:51:15,634;A pretty prize, lads.

863;00:51:17,537;00:51:19,305;Girl.

865;00:51:22,876;00:51:25,345;are you doing
865;00:51:22,876;00:51:25,345;with the Stark bitch?
866;00:51:36,390;00:51:38,959;Jaime:
866;00:51:36,390;00:51:38,959;It's a tough decision--
867;00:51:38,993;00:51:40,994;take the bridge
867;00:51:38,993;00:51:40,994;and risk being seen
868;00:51:41,029;00:51:42,930;or cross the great water.
869;00:51:42,964;00:51:45,532;Silence, Kingslayer.
869;00:51:42,964;00:51:45,532;Anyone can see us on the bridge,
870;00:51:45,566;00:51:48,569;but cross by water
870;00:51:45,566;00:51:48,569;and the current could take us
871;00:51:48,603;00:51:50,570;or I could escape
871;00:51:48,603;00:51:50,570;down the river.
872;00:51:50,605;00:51:52,472;Good luck.
873;00:51:54,442;00:51:58,478;It's wonderful to watch you
873;00:51:54,442;00:51:58,478;wrestle with these dilemmas.
874;00:51:58,513;00:52:00,647;Which will she choose?
875;00:52:05,554;00:52:07,521;Gambler at heart.
876;00:52:07,555;00:52:08,989;Wouldn't have guessed.
877;00:52:09,023;00:52:11,158;Be quick about it.
878;00:52:15,563;00:52:18,232;( Jaime groans )
879;00:52:18,267;00:52:19,667;I need to rest.
879;00:52:18,267;00:52:19,667;Get up.
880;00:52:19,701;00:52:22,136;I have these, you know, on your
880;00:52:19,701;00:52:22,136;feet when you walk too far.
881;00:52:22,170;00:52:23,337;What do you call them?
881;00:52:22,170;00:52:23,337;Get up now.
882;00:52:23,371;00:52:25,873;Corns. I never
882;00:52:23,371;00:52:25,873;used to get corns.
883;00:52:25,907;00:52:28,241;Of course I used
883;00:52:25,907;00:52:28,241;to ride everywhere,
884;00:52:28,276;00:52:30,744;not march around
884;00:52:28,276;00:52:30,744;like a common foot soldier
885;00:52:30,778;00:52:33,012;wearing the same shit boots
885;00:52:30,778;00:52:33,012;for over a year.
886;00:52:33,047;00:52:35,448;This heel is ruined.
886;00:52:33,047;00:52:35,448;There's no way--

889;00:52:43,555;00:52:47,192;I never understood why some knights
889;00:52:43,555;00:52:47,192;felt the need to carry two swords.

893;00:53:12,750;00:53:15,051;for a great beast of a woman.
894;00:53:18,988;00:53:21,056;You shouldn't grimace
894;00:53:18,988;00:53:21,056;before you lunge.
895;00:53:21,090;00:53:23,591;It gives away the game.
896;00:53:37,139;00:53:39,441;Bit of a quandary for you.
897;00:53:39,475;00:53:42,344;If you kill me,
897;00:53:39,475;00:53:42,344;you fail Lady Stark.
898;00:53:42,377;00:53:44,979;But if you don't kill me,
899;00:53:45,013;00:53:47,315;I'm going to kill you.

902;00:54:06,269;00:54:08,537;willing to hurt me,
903;00:54:08,571;00:54:10,372;you might have had me there.

916;00:55:07,865;00:55:11,568;That's him, all right.
