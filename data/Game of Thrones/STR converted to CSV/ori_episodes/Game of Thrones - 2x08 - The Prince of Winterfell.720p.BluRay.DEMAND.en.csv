1;00:02:05,292;00:02:07,794;Riders approaching!
1;00:02:05,292;00:02:07,794;Open the gate!
2;00:02:35,531;00:02:38,032;Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell.
3;00:02:39,201;00:02:41,661;Envy isn't attractive.
3;00:02:39,201;00:02:41,661;What envy?
4;00:02:42,287;00:02:44,747;You should be proud
4;00:02:42,287;00:02:44,747;of your brother's achievement.
5;00:02:44,832;00:02:47,333;I took the great castle of Winterfell
5;00:02:44,832;00:02:47,333;with 20 men.
6;00:02:47,417;00:02:49,210;You're a great warrior.
7;00:02:49,294;00:02:51,838;I saw the bodies above your gates.
8;00:02:51,922;00:02:56,175;Which one gave you the tougher fight,
8;00:02:51,922;00:02:56,175;the cripple or the six-year-old?
9;00:02:58,095;00:03:01,681;I treated the Stark boys with honor,
9;00:02:58,095;00:03:01,681;and they repaid me with treachery.
10;00:03:01,765;00:03:04,934;You treated them with honor?
10;00:03:01,765;00:03:04,934;By butchering them?
11;00:03:05,018;00:03:06,269;Before I had to kill them,
12;00:03:06,353;00:03:09,146;I treated them...
12;00:03:06,353;00:03:09,146;You seized their home, as is your right.
13;00:03:09,231;00:03:10,940;We're ironborn, we take what we need.
14;00:03:11,024;00:03:12,024;Exactly.
15;00:03:12,109;00:03:15,194;Then you made them prisoners in their home
15;00:03:12,109;00:03:15,194;and they ran away.
16;00:03:15,279;00:03:16,946;Is that treachery?
17;00:03:17,531;00:03:19,282;I'd call it bravery.
18;00:03:19,533;00:03:22,869;They made me a promise...
18;00:03:19,533;00:03:22,869;Your little boy prisoners made you a promise
19;00:03:22,953;00:03:25,580;and you got mad when they broke it?
20;00:03:25,664;00:03:27,248;Are you the dumbest cunt alive?
21;00:03:27,332;00:03:28,958;Don't call me...
21;00:03:27,332;00:03:28,958;A cunt.
22;00:03:29,293;00:03:32,920;A dumb cunt who killed
22;00:03:29,293;00:03:32,920;the only two Starks in Winterfell.
23;00:03:33,547;00:03:35,464;You know how valuable those boys were?
24;00:03:35,549;00:03:38,384;If I hadn't killed them,
24;00:03:35,549;00:03:38,384;the Northerners would think me weak.
25;00:03:38,468;00:03:41,220;You are weak. And you're stupid.
26;00:03:41,305;00:03:42,305;I'm warning you.
27;00:03:44,224;00:03:46,684;Go on, then. Warn me.
28;00:03:51,481;00:03:53,357;You haven't brought enough men.
29;00:03:53,442;00:03:55,651;How am I supposed to
29;00:03:53,442;00:03:55,651;defend Winterfell with just this lot?
30;00:03:55,736;00:03:56,736;You're not.
31;00:03:57,112;00:03:59,906;I've come to bring you home.
31;00:03:57,112;00:03:59,906;Father wants a word.
32;00:03:59,990;00:04:01,657;Is this a joke?
33;00:04:01,742;00:04:03,075;Winterfell is the heart of the North.
34;00:04:03,160;00:04:06,120;Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea.
35;00:04:07,080;00:04:10,082;We're islanders, baby brother.
35;00:04:07,080;00:04:10,082;Had you forgotten that?
36;00:04:10,167;00:04:13,002;Our power comes from our ships.
37;00:04:13,086;00:04:16,547;And now that you've decorated your walls
37;00:04:13,086;00:04:16,547;with the bodies of the Stark boys,
38;00:04:16,632;00:04:19,842;every man in the North wants
38;00:04:16,632;00:04:19,842;to see you hanged.
39;00:04:20,844;00:04:23,346;When Robb Stark finds out...
39;00:04:20,844;00:04:23,346;He won't find out.
40;00:04:23,430;00:04:24,972;We've killed all the ravens.
41;00:04:25,057;00:04:27,016;We have all the horses.
42;00:04:28,352;00:04:30,269;I've taken Winterfell.
43;00:04:31,146;00:04:33,564;And I will keep Winterfell.
44;00:04:36,944;00:04:37,944;Leave us.
45;00:04:51,750;00:04:53,751;Theon, you're my blood.
46;00:04:54,920;00:04:57,588;We both loved our mother.
47;00:04:57,673;00:05:00,383;We both endured our father.
48;00:05:02,594;00:05:04,845;Come home with me. Don't die here alone.
49;00:05:04,930;00:05:06,889;I don't intend to die.
50;00:05:12,396;00:05:14,397;You were a terrible baby, do you know that?
51;00:05:16,358;00:05:19,068;Bawling all the time, never sleeping.
52;00:05:20,570;00:05:23,072;And one night, you just wouldn't shut up,
53;00:05:23,156;00:05:25,366;screaming like a dying pig.
54;00:05:27,119;00:05:30,746;I walked over to your crib,
54;00:05:27,119;00:05:30,746;I looked down at you.
55;00:05:30,831;00:05:32,957;I wanted to strangle you.
56;00:05:34,126;00:05:37,461;And you looked up at me
56;00:05:34,126;00:05:37,461;and you stopped screaming.
57;00:05:38,588;00:05:40,339;You smiled at me.
58;00:05:45,262;00:05:47,138;Don't die so far from the sea.
59;00:06:02,446;00:06:05,364;I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones.
60;00:06:06,658;00:06:09,702;I already got one crow. Don't need two.
61;00:06:09,786;00:06:11,954;Mance will want to question this one.
62;00:06:12,039;00:06:14,457;Knows all about where the crows are
62;00:06:12,039;00:06:14,457;and what they're planning.
63;00:06:14,541;00:06:18,210;The Halfhand knows more.
63;00:06:14,541;00:06:18,210;This one is just a little boy.
64;00:06:18,295;00:06:19,336;Gut him.
65;00:06:19,629;00:06:22,298;He could have killed me half a dozen times.
66;00:06:22,382;00:06:23,674;And now he wishes he did.
67;00:06:24,384;00:06:25,384;Gut him.
68;00:06:25,469;00:06:28,846;He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son.
69;00:06:32,476;00:06:34,268;Mance will want him.
70;00:06:35,270;00:06:37,730;What does Mance want
70;00:06:35,270;00:06:37,730;with a dead man's bastard?
71;00:06:37,814;00:06:39,065;I don't know.
72;00:06:39,649;00:06:42,276;I think he'll want to decide for himself.
73;00:06:48,575;00:06:52,078;He runs, I'll chop his balls off.
74;00:06:52,412;00:06:54,789;He runs, I'll do it meself.
75;00:07:02,506;00:07:04,799;We're even now, Jon Snow.
76;00:07:18,313;00:07:19,939;I couldn't do it.
77;00:07:20,524;00:07:22,108;I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't...
78;00:07:22,192;00:07:23,359;I know.
79;00:07:24,361;00:07:25,736;The others?
80;00:07:25,821;00:07:28,614;When you didn't come back,
80;00:07:25,821;00:07:28,614;we went looking for you.
81;00:07:28,698;00:07:31,158;We found your tracks fast enough.
82;00:07:31,243;00:07:33,911;But they found us before we found you.
83;00:07:35,038;00:07:36,247;They died because of me.
84;00:07:38,208;00:07:39,708;See that it wasn't for nothing.
85;00:07:39,793;00:07:40,918;All right, up, lad.
86;00:07:41,336;00:07:43,212;Come on, on your feet, now.
87;00:07:43,296;00:07:44,547;Move it.
88;00:07:50,887;00:07:52,513;Is she beautiful?
89;00:07:53,557;00:07:55,307;I've never met her.
90;00:07:56,017;00:07:57,434;What's her name?
91;00:07:57,519;00:08:00,563;Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name.
92;00:08:02,107;00:08:04,400;I'm sure you'll be very happy.
93;00:08:08,155;00:08:09,864;And you're marrying her for a bridge?
94;00:08:09,948;00:08:11,699;An important bridge.
94;00:08:09,948;00:08:11,699;Ah.
95;00:08:13,368;00:08:15,911;It was before they killed my father.
96;00:08:16,830;00:08:19,373;I still thought I could march south
96;00:08:16,830;00:08:19,373;and rescue him in time,
97;00:08:19,457;00:08:21,917;but only if I crossed that bridge.
98;00:08:24,087;00:08:26,672;When I speak to people from the North,
99;00:08:26,756;00:08:28,966;they all loved your father.
100;00:08:30,135;00:08:32,511;He was the best man I ever met.
101;00:08:32,596;00:08:35,264;I know children always think that
101;00:08:32,596;00:08:35,264;about their fathers, but...
102;00:08:35,348;00:08:39,435;Children do not always think that
102;00:08:35,348;00:08:39,435;about their fathers, believe me.
103;00:08:41,104;00:08:44,982;He once told me
103;00:08:41,104;00:08:44,982;that being a lord is like being a father,
104;00:08:45,066;00:08:49,612;except you have thousands of children
104;00:08:45,066;00:08:49,612;and you worry about all of them.
105;00:08:49,696;00:08:52,615;The farmers plowing the fields
105;00:08:49,696;00:08:52,615;are yours to protect.
106;00:08:52,699;00:08:55,784;The charwomen scrubbing the floors,
106;00:08:52,699;00:08:55,784;yours to protect.
107;00:08:55,869;00:08:58,454;The soldiers you order into battle.
108;00:08:59,706;00:09:04,710;He told me he woke with fear in the morning
108;00:08:59,706;00:09:04,710;and went to bed with fear in the night.
109;00:09:05,962;00:09:07,755;I didn't believe him.
110;00:09:09,507;00:09:13,135;I asked him,
110;00:09:09,507;00:09:13,135;How can a man be brave if he's afraid?
111;00:09:14,554;00:09:18,307;That is the only time a man can be brave,
111;00:09:14,554;00:09:18,307;he told me.
112;00:09:21,228;00:09:23,437;I wish I could have met him.
113;00:09:24,481;00:09:26,482;He would have liked you.
114;00:09:28,902;00:09:31,528;Most lords worry more about their gold
114;00:09:28,902;00:09:31,528;and their glory
115;00:09:31,613;00:09:33,364;than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.
116;00:09:33,448;00:09:36,825;He didn't care much about gold or glory.
116;00:09:33,448;00:09:36,825;And you?
117;00:09:37,369;00:09:41,288;You think I'm fighting this war
117;00:09:37,369;00:09:41,288;so they'll sing songs about me?
118;00:09:41,998;00:09:43,415;I want to go home.
119;00:09:44,417;00:09:47,878;I want the men following me to go home.
119;00:09:44,417;00:09:47,878;Then why don't you?
120;00:09:47,963;00:09:51,757;Because we'll never be safe
120;00:09:47,963;00:09:51,757;until the Lannisters are defeated.
121;00:09:51,841;00:09:53,926;And because I believe in justice.
122;00:09:54,010;00:09:57,388;Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean.
122;00:09:54,010;00:09:57,388;That would be a start.
123;00:10:07,399;00:10:09,108;Your Grace, milady.
124;00:10:09,859;00:10:12,569;The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night.
125;00:10:13,196;00:10:17,449;How?
126;00:10:22,205;00:10:23,872;Tell me this isn't true.
127;00:10:28,753;00:10:29,962;Why?
128;00:10:31,756;00:10:33,257;For the girls.
129;00:10:33,341;00:10:34,508;You betrayed me.
129;00:10:33,341;00:10:34,508;Robb...
130;00:10:34,592;00:10:35,718;No!
131;00:10:36,303;00:10:39,596;You knew I would not allow it
131;00:10:36,303;00:10:39,596;and you did it anyway.
132;00:10:40,432;00:10:44,143;Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell.
133;00:10:44,227;00:10:47,271;Sansa and Arya are
133;00:10:44,227;00:10:47,271;captives in King's Landing.
134;00:10:47,355;00:10:49,940;I have five children,
134;00:10:47,355;00:10:49,940;and only one of them is free.
135;00:10:50,025;00:10:53,902;I lost one son fighting by your son's side.
136;00:10:53,987;00:10:57,573;I lost another to the Kingslayer,
136;00:10:53,987;00:10:57,573;strangled with a chain.
137;00:10:58,325;00:11:02,411;You commit treason
137;00:10:58,325;00:11:02,411;because your children are prisoners?
138;00:11:03,163;00:11:06,790;I would carve out my heart
138;00:11:03,163;00:11:06,790;and offer it to the Father,
139;00:11:06,875;00:11:11,295;if he would let my sons wake
139;00:11:06,875;00:11:11,295;from their graves and step into a prison cell.
140;00:11:11,379;00:11:13,839;I grieve for your sons, my lord.
140;00:11:11,379;00:11:13,839;I don't want your grief.
141;00:11:13,923;00:11:15,966;I want my vengeance.
142;00:11:16,051;00:11:18,260;And you stole it from me.
143;00:11:20,013;00:11:23,766;Killing Jaime Lannister
143;00:11:20,013;00:11:23,766;would not buy life for your children,
144;00:11:23,850;00:11:27,519;but returning him to King's Landing
144;00:11:23,850;00:11:27,519;may buy life for mine.
145;00:11:28,605;00:11:30,856;Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool.
146;00:11:32,108;00:11:34,193;You've weakened our position.
147;00:11:34,277;00:11:35,903;You've brought discord into our camp.
148;00:11:36,988;00:11:39,490;And you did it all behind my back.
149;00:11:42,744;00:11:45,371;Make sure she's guarded day and night.
149;00:11:42,744;00:11:45,371;Robb.
150;00:11:45,455;00:11:47,831;How many men did we send
150;00:11:45,455;00:11:47,831;in pursuit of the Kingslayer?
151;00:11:47,916;00:11:48,999;Forty, Your Grace.
152;00:11:49,084;00:11:52,086;Send another 40 with our fastest horses.
153;00:11:52,170;00:11:53,670;Robb.
154;00:12:11,356;00:12:12,523;Damn.
155;00:12:16,152;00:12:18,487;You're much uglier in daylight.
156;00:12:18,571;00:12:20,239;What's your name?
157;00:12:21,491;00:12:25,119;I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock,
157;00:12:21,491;00:12:25,119;son of Tywin.
158;00:12:26,996;00:12:30,582;A captive knight has
158;00:12:26,996;00:12:30,582;a right to know his captor's identity.
159;00:12:30,667;00:12:32,251;Brienne of Tarth.
160;00:12:32,335;00:12:34,336;Tarth, Tarth, Tarth.
161;00:12:34,421;00:12:37,047;Crescent moons and starbursts.
162;00:12:37,132;00:12:38,715;Lord...
163;00:12:38,800;00:12:41,885;Selwyn Tarth. Your father.
164;00:12:43,680;00:12:47,057;Do you have any brothers and sisters,
164;00:12:43,680;00:12:47,057;my lady?
165;00:12:47,142;00:12:51,270;It's a long way to King's Landing.
165;00:12:47,142;00:12:51,270;Might as well get to know one another.
166;00:12:52,897;00:12:54,398;Have you known many men?
167;00:12:54,482;00:12:55,607;I suppose not.
168;00:12:56,025;00:12:57,401;Women?
169;00:12:57,485;00:12:58,485;Horses? Ah.
170;00:13:00,864;00:13:02,948;I didn't mean to give offense, my lady.
170;00:13:00,864;00:13:02,948;Forgive me.
171;00:13:03,032;00:13:05,576;Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer.
172;00:13:05,660;00:13:08,203;Why do you hate me so much?
172;00:13:05,660;00:13:08,203;Have I ever harmed you?
173;00:13:08,288;00:13:11,874;You've harmed others,
173;00:13:08,288;00:13:11,874;those you were sworn to protect,
174;00:13:12,500;00:13:14,293;the weak, the innocent.
175;00:13:14,377;00:13:17,504;Has anyone ever told you
175;00:13:14,377;00:13:17,504;you're as boring as you are ugly?
176;00:13:17,589;00:13:20,132;You will not provoke me to anger.
177;00:13:20,216;00:13:22,843;I already have. Look at you.
178;00:13:22,927;00:13:24,428;You're ready to chop my head off.
179;00:13:25,555;00:13:27,389;Do you think you could?
180;00:13:27,474;00:13:29,183;Do you think you could beat me
180;00:13:27,474;00:13:29,183;in a fair fight?
181;00:13:29,267;00:13:31,143;I've never seen you fight.
182;00:13:31,227;00:13:32,936;The answer is no.
183;00:13:33,438;00:13:36,482;There are three men in the kingdoms
183;00:13:33,438;00:13:36,482;who might have a chance against me.
184;00:13:36,566;00:13:38,066;You're not one of them.
185;00:13:38,485;00:13:41,570;All my life men like you have sneered at me.
186;00:13:41,654;00:13:44,490;And all my life I've been
186;00:13:41,654;00:13:44,490;knocking men like you into the dust.
187;00:13:44,574;00:13:47,701;If you're so confident, unlock my chains.
187;00:13:44,574;00:13:47,701;Let's see what happens.
188;00:13:48,953;00:13:51,497;Do you take me for an idiot? In!
189;00:13:54,250;00:13:57,878;I took you for a fighter, a man...
190;00:13:57,962;00:14:00,547;Pardon. Woman of honor.
191;00:14:01,674;00:14:03,467;Was I wrong?
192;00:14:03,551;00:14:05,135;You're afraid.
193;00:14:06,930;00:14:10,015;Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer.
194;00:14:23,446;00:14:27,324;King's Landing will fall
194;00:14:23,446;00:14:27,324;an hour after Stannis lands his force.
195;00:14:28,785;00:14:33,830;It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei
195;00:14:28,785;00:14:33,830;and the court to ride west to safety.
196;00:14:34,582;00:14:36,124;Surrender the Iron Throne?
197;00:14:36,209;00:14:39,419;Better than seeing their heads mounted
197;00:14:36,209;00:14:39,419;on the city gates.
198;00:14:39,504;00:14:41,755;Stannis will execute them all.
199;00:14:41,839;00:14:45,217;No, a king who runs will not be king for long.
200;00:14:45,301;00:14:47,761;He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight.
201;00:14:49,514;00:14:53,850;Stannis, two days from the capital
201;00:14:49,514;00:14:53,850;and the wolf at my doorstep.
202;00:14:53,935;00:14:57,980;The scouts assure us
202;00:14:53,935;00:14:57,980;Robb Stark remains north ofAshemark.
203;00:14:58,064;00:15:00,732;Ha! The last time the scouts assured us
203;00:14:58,064;00:15:00,732;of Stark's movement,
204;00:15:00,817;00:15:02,317;he lured us into a trap.
205;00:15:04,195;00:15:06,822;Which is why my son is his prisoner.
206;00:15:10,618;00:15:12,327;Too close to Casterly Rock.
207;00:15:14,038;00:15:17,291;He sent a splinter force
207;00:15:14,038;00:15:17,291;to recapture Winterfell.
208;00:15:18,167;00:15:20,002;The Greyjoys have done us a great favor.
209;00:15:20,670;00:15:24,881;Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock
209;00:15:20,670;00:15:24,881;until he's at full force.
210;00:15:24,966;00:15:27,175;He's a boy and he's never lost a battle.
211;00:15:29,137;00:15:31,013;He'll risk anything at any time
212;00:15:32,015;00:15:34,391;because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.
213;00:15:42,400;00:15:44,192;We'll ride at nightfall.
214;00:15:44,277;00:15:47,195;I want a full night's march
214;00:15:44,277;00:15:47,195;before he knows we're on the move.
215;00:15:47,572;00:15:51,283;Clegane, you'll maintain
215;00:15:47,572;00:15:51,283;a garrison here at Harrenhal.
216;00:15:51,367;00:15:54,202;Track down this brotherhood
216;00:15:51,367;00:15:54,202;and destroy them.
217;00:15:56,998;00:15:59,833;The girl has proven herself a good servant.
218;00:15:59,917;00:16:02,169;She'll stay on with you.
219;00:16:02,253;00:16:04,212;See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings.
220;00:16:05,173;00:16:09,468;He's poor company when he's sober,
220;00:16:05,173;00:16:09,468;but he's better at his work.
221;00:16:16,643;00:16:19,269;You've got some
221;00:16:16,643;00:16:19,269;questions to answer.
222;00:16:19,354;00:16:21,229;Who killed Ser Amory?
223;00:16:21,314;00:16:23,815;I don't know! Please!
223;00:16:21,314;00:16:23,815;Give me the name.
224;00:16:23,900;00:16:27,861;Take this one out for the crows.
224;00:16:23,900;00:16:27,861;I told you, I don't know.
225;00:16:28,738;00:16:30,113;Please.
226;00:16:30,907;00:16:33,575;Look, it's Yoren's little cunt.
227;00:16:33,660;00:16:36,453;Used to be a boy, now it's a girl.
228;00:16:36,537;00:16:38,080;Where's Jaqen?
229;00:16:38,164;00:16:39,665;Don't care.
230;00:16:40,416;00:16:42,751;Where's your stick now, bitch?
231;00:16:42,835;00:16:44,461;I promised to fuck you with it.
232;00:16:44,545;00:16:47,172;Come on, time to kill some wolves.
233;00:16:56,766;00:16:58,725;You need sour cherries to make it right.
234;00:16:58,810;00:17:01,895;And the secret is you dry the stones,
234;00:16:58,810;00:17:01,895;and then you break them with a mallet.
235;00:17:02,188;00:17:05,232;That's where the real flavor is.
235;00:17:02,188;00:17:05,232;You crush 'em up real fine.
236;00:17:05,316;00:17:07,484;And then when you're finished,
236;00:17:05,316;00:17:07,484;you sprinkle them over the piecrust.
237;00:17:07,568;00:17:08,568;Where's Jaqen?
238;00:17:08,653;00:17:10,445;How would I know?
238;00:17:08,653;00:17:10,445;I need him now.
239;00:17:11,656;00:17:14,116;Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
239;00:17:11,656;00:17:14,116;You need him?
240;00:17:14,742;00:17:15,951;He's helping me.
241;00:17:16,035;00:17:18,120;I saw him.
241;00:17:16,035;00:17:18,120;Where?
242;00:17:21,416;00:17:23,041;Where? Where?
242;00:17:21,416;00:17:23,041;Ow!
243;00:17:23,126;00:17:25,377;They went riding out the gates
243;00:17:23,126;00:17:25,377;a few hours ago.
244;00:17:25,461;00:17:26,628;On patrol.
245;00:17:27,130;00:17:28,839;Let go of my ears.
246;00:17:33,803;00:17:35,595;What do you want with him anyway?
247;00:17:51,237;00:17:53,321;Mance is gonna march on the Wall.
248;00:17:53,406;00:17:57,659;When he does, one brother inside his army
248;00:17:53,406;00:17:57,659;will be worth 1,000 fighting against it.
249;00:17:57,744;00:17:59,828;They'll never trust me.
249;00:17:57,744;00:17:59,828;They might.
250;00:17:59,912;00:18:01,705;If you do what needs to be done.
250;00:17:59,912;00:18:01,705;What?
251;00:18:01,789;00:18:04,416;How does it feel
251;00:18:01,789;00:18:04,416;knowing those men all died
252;00:18:04,500;00:18:07,586;so you could skip through the snow
252;00:18:04,500;00:18:07,586;with your little savage girl?
253;00:18:07,670;00:18:09,254;I didn't.
253;00:18:07,670;00:18:09,254;I should have known better,
254;00:18:09,338;00:18:11,339;trusting a traitor's bastard.
255;00:18:15,720;00:18:18,430;He's not yours to kill, crow.
256;00:18:41,537;00:18:42,704;Do you have to do that here?
257;00:18:44,749;00:18:47,000;I like to keep me hands clean.
258;00:18:47,835;00:18:50,337;Yes, but do you have to do it here?
259;00:18:59,680;00:19:00,972;You should start wearing the gold cloak.
260;00:19:01,057;00:19:02,516;I don't want to wear a gold cloak.
261;00:19:02,600;00:19:04,643;You're commander of the City Watch.
262;00:19:04,727;00:19:08,271;You shouldn't be dressed like a common...
262;00:19:04,727;00:19:08,271;A cloak slows you down in a fight.
263;00:19:08,356;00:19:10,524;Makes it hard to move quietly.
264;00:19:10,608;00:19:14,319;And the gold catches the light,
264;00:19:10,608;00:19:14,319;so you're nice and easy to spot at night.
265;00:19:14,403;00:19:17,614;Well, you're not
265;00:19:14,403;00:19:17,614;sneaking through alleyways any longer.
266;00:19:17,698;00:19:18,907;You're supposed to stand out.
267;00:19:18,991;00:19:22,077;We had a deal
267;00:19:18,991;00:19:22,077;and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.
268;00:19:22,161;00:19:23,787;Fine, fine.
269;00:19:25,748;00:19:27,415;No gold cloak.
270;00:19:35,132;00:19:36,258;What?
271;00:19:36,801;00:19:38,009;What?
271;00:19:36,801;00:19:38,009;What? What?
272;00:19:38,094;00:19:39,469;Why are you staring at me?
273;00:19:40,805;00:19:43,974;You don't want me cleaning me nails.
273;00:19:40,805;00:19:43,974;You don't want me looking your way.
274;00:19:44,559;00:19:46,142;Why am I here?
275;00:19:46,227;00:19:48,395;To help me plan
275;00:19:46,227;00:19:48,395;the defense of King's Landing.
276;00:19:49,605;00:19:51,773;Stannis will be here any day.
277;00:19:55,319;00:19:57,112;And one of these explains how to beat him?
278;00:19:59,490;00:20:01,700;An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros.
279;00:20:01,784;00:20:04,077;By Archmaester Shevelathin.
280;00:20:05,246;00:20:06,621;Shevelatesh.
281;00:20:06,706;00:20:08,206;Chevalteesh.
282;00:20:11,627;00:20:14,546;I'd swap all your books
282;00:20:11,627;00:20:14,546;for a few good archers.
283;00:20:14,630;00:20:16,673;My Lord Hand. Commander.
284;00:20:16,757;00:20:20,176;I must compliment you
284;00:20:16,757;00:20:20,176;on the gold cloaks' performance
285;00:20:20,261;00:20:21,386;these last few weeks.
286;00:20:22,305;00:20:25,724;Did you know there has been
286;00:20:22,305;00:20:25,724;a marked drop in thievery?
287;00:20:26,684;00:20:28,351;I did not know.
288;00:20:29,270;00:20:31,771;And how did you accomplish
288;00:20:29,270;00:20:31,771;this marked drop in thievery?
289;00:20:32,773;00:20:34,983;Me and the lads rounded up
289;00:20:32,773;00:20:34,983;all the known thieves.
290;00:20:36,485;00:20:37,944;For questioning?
291;00:20:38,029;00:20:39,195;No.
292;00:20:40,573;00:20:42,699;It's just the unknown thieves
292;00:20:40,573;00:20:42,699;we need to worry about now.
293;00:20:42,783;00:20:45,744;We talked about this.
293;00:20:42,783;00:20:45,744;Aye, we talked about it.
294;00:20:45,828;00:20:48,914;Have you ever been in a city under siege?
295;00:20:48,998;00:20:51,499;Maybe this part's not in your books.
296;00:20:51,584;00:20:54,461;See, it's not the fighting
296;00:20:51,584;00:20:54,461;that kills most people. It's the starving.
297;00:20:55,129;00:20:57,213;Food's worth more than gold.
298;00:20:57,298;00:21:00,967;Noble ladies sell their diamonds
298;00:20:57,298;00:21:00,967;for a sack of potatoes.
299;00:21:01,052;00:21:04,304;Things get bad enough,
299;00:21:01,052;00:21:04,304;the poor start eating each other.
300;00:21:05,139;00:21:07,515;The thieves, they love a siege.
301;00:21:07,600;00:21:10,518;Soon as the gates are sealed,
301;00:21:07,600;00:21:10,518;they steal all the food.
302;00:21:10,603;00:21:14,314;By the time it's all over,
302;00:21:10,603;00:21:14,314;they're the richest men in town.
303;00:21:15,149;00:21:19,861;Given the circumstances, my lord,
303;00:21:15,149;00:21:19,861;I believe extreme measures are warranted.
304;00:21:20,905;00:21:22,072;Ah.
305;00:21:22,531;00:21:25,283;The Great Sieges of Westeros.
306;00:21:25,368;00:21:27,452;Thrilling subject.
307;00:21:27,536;00:21:31,665;Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan
307;00:21:27,536;00:21:31,665;wasn't a better writer.
308;00:21:36,212;00:21:38,421;Stannis knows King's Landing.
309;00:21:39,465;00:21:41,800;He knows where the walls are strongest,
310;00:21:41,884;00:21:45,178;and he knows which gates are weakest.
311;00:21:48,307;00:21:49,766;The Mud Gate.
312;00:21:51,352;00:21:53,103;A good ram will batter it down in minutes,
313;00:21:53,312;00:21:55,522;and it's only 50 yards from the water.
314;00:21:55,606;00:21:57,399;That's where he'll land.
315;00:21:57,483;00:22:00,193;And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate,
316;00:22:00,277;00:22:02,070;what is our plan?
317;00:22:03,072;00:22:04,781;We could throw books at his men.
318;00:22:04,865;00:22:06,241;We don't have that many books.
319;00:22:06,325;00:22:07,742;We don't have that many men, either.
320;00:22:08,995;00:22:10,912;What do we have?
321;00:22:12,456;00:22:13,873;Pig shit.
322;00:22:32,518;00:22:34,394;I'm not cut out for this sort of work.
323;00:22:34,937;00:22:38,481;I always imagined meself
323;00:22:34,937;00:22:38,481;doing something much worse.
324;00:22:38,566;00:22:41,276;We're digging latrine pits
324;00:22:38,566;00:22:41,276;at the end of the world.
325;00:22:41,360;00:22:43,319;I can't imagine anything much worse.
326;00:22:44,321;00:22:46,239;You lack imagination.
327;00:22:48,743;00:22:50,702;Where do you think Jon is right now?
328;00:22:50,786;00:22:53,580;He went off with the Halfhand.
328;00:22:50,786;00:22:53,580;He didn't come back.
329;00:22:53,998;00:22:55,623;A betting man would go with dead.
330;00:22:57,168;00:22:58,752;He's not dead.
331;00:22:58,836;00:23:00,879;No, Jon's a great fighter.
332;00:23:01,380;00:23:04,132;Well, he's better than me
332;00:23:01,380;00:23:04,132;and a lot better than you.
333;00:23:04,967;00:23:07,302;He's got a Valyrian steel sword.
334;00:23:08,304;00:23:09,679;So did his father.
335;00:23:10,097;00:23:12,557;And Qhorin Halfhand
335;00:23:10,097;00:23:12,557;is the greatest ranger alive.
336;00:23:12,641;00:23:15,435;Great rangers never get old is the problem.
337;00:23:15,519;00:23:17,270;Shit ones neither.
338;00:23:18,230;00:23:21,316;It's them in the middle that last a long time.
339;00:23:26,447;00:23:28,615;What in seven hells is that?
340;00:23:44,381;00:23:46,633;The First Men made these marks.
341;00:23:46,717;00:23:48,343;Help me with it.
342;00:24:02,024;00:24:03,024;Look.
343;00:24:07,363;00:24:09,697;If you find something you're not supposed to,
344;00:24:09,782;00:24:13,076;best thing to do
344;00:24:09,782;00:24:13,076;is pretend you've never seen it.
345;00:24:13,160;00:24:15,161;That's a Night's Watch cloak.
346;00:24:15,246;00:24:16,913;It's been here a long time.
347;00:24:22,378;00:24:23,378;Oh.
348;00:24:23,796;00:24:25,296;Must be dragonglass.
349;00:24:25,381;00:24:26,756;Dragonglass?
350;00:24:27,216;00:24:29,425;The maesters call it obsidian.
351;00:24:31,679;00:24:32,971;Why would a brother hide it here?
352;00:24:33,597;00:24:36,891;I expect it's 'cause
352;00:24:33,597;00:24:36,891;he wanted somebody to find it.
353;00:24:42,481;00:24:44,440;Mind where you're going.
354;00:24:53,033;00:24:54,701;I'm sorry. I'll...
355;00:24:55,911;00:24:57,662;Where were you?
356;00:24:57,746;00:24:58,997;A man has patrol duty.
357;00:24:59,081;00:25:01,875;Tywin Lannister was right here,
357;00:24:59,081;00:25:01,875;and now he's gone.
358;00:25:01,959;00:25:03,918;A girl owes one more name.
359;00:25:04,003;00:25:06,004;The Red God demands it.
359;00:25:04,003;00:25:06,004;Give the man a name.
360;00:25:07,798;00:25:11,593;How long after I give you the name
360;00:25:07,798;00:25:11,593;does it take you to kill someone?
361;00:25:11,677;00:25:14,512;A minute, an hour, a month.
362;00:25:16,265;00:25:17,599;Death is certain,
363;00:25:18,934;00:25:20,351;the time is not.
364;00:25:20,436;00:25:22,687;He's taking his army to attack my brother.
365;00:25:22,771;00:25:24,814;I need him dead right now.
366;00:25:25,441;00:25:27,275;This a man cannot do.
367;00:25:28,611;00:25:30,111;You promised you'd help me.
368;00:25:30,321;00:25:33,198;Help was not promised, lovely girl.
368;00:25:30,321;00:25:33,198;Only death.
369;00:25:33,991;00:25:37,493;There must be others. Give a name, any name.
370;00:25:37,578;00:25:39,370;And you'll kill them?
371;00:25:40,206;00:25:41,456;Anybody?
372;00:25:44,752;00:25:47,545;By the Seven New Gods
372;00:25:44,752;00:25:47,545;and the Old Gods beyond counting,
373;00:25:47,630;00:25:49,214;I swear it.
374;00:25:52,301;00:25:53,635;All right.
375;00:25:59,308;00:26:00,975;Jaqen H'ghar.
376;00:26:07,650;00:26:09,484;A girl gives a man his own name?
377;00:26:09,902;00:26:12,153;That's right.
377;00:26:09,902;00:26:12,153;Gods are not mocked.
378;00:26:12,321;00:26:14,739;This is no joking thing.
378;00:26:12,321;00:26:14,739;I'm not joking.
379;00:26:14,823;00:26:16,282;A man can go kill himself.
380;00:26:16,367;00:26:17,742;Un-name me.
381;00:26:17,826;00:26:19,244;No.
381;00:26:17,826;00:26:19,244;Please?
382;00:26:21,914;00:26:22,997;I'll un-name you.
383;00:26:24,792;00:26:26,876;Thank you.
383;00:26:24,792;00:26:26,876;If you help me and my friends escape.
384;00:26:29,255;00:26:30,755;This would require more than one life.
385;00:26:30,839;00:26:33,925;This is not part of our bargain.
385;00:26:30,839;00:26:33,925;Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.
386;00:26:34,718;00:26:35,885;A girl lacks honor.
387;00:26:44,186;00:26:47,063;If I do this thing, a girl must obey.
388;00:26:47,147;00:26:48,856;A girl will obey.
389;00:26:51,026;00:26:54,862;A girl and her friends will
389;00:26:51,026;00:26:54,862;walk through the gate at midnight.
390;00:26:59,201;00:27:00,910;Thank you, Podrick.
391;00:27:07,668;00:27:09,210;Odd little boy.
392;00:27:09,878;00:27:11,713;I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
393;00:27:12,589;00:27:14,173;You and Varys both.
394;00:27:16,176;00:27:18,303;Excellent lamprey pie.
395;00:27:18,387;00:27:21,472;Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day?
396;00:27:22,057;00:27:23,766;I hear Joffrey plans on fighting.
397;00:27:24,435;00:27:26,185;An inspiration for the troops.
398;00:27:26,270;00:27:27,895;The young king in his shining armor
399;00:27:28,105;00:27:30,648;fighting to defend the capital
399;00:27:28,105;00:27:30,648;against the wicked old rebel.
400;00:27:30,733;00:27:32,608;He's only a boy.
401;00:27:32,693;00:27:35,403;Younger boys are off fighting his war.
402;00:27:36,030;00:27:38,573;He's not ready.
402;00:27:36,030;00:27:38,573;What is he, 17?
403;00:27:39,366;00:27:41,951;Remember Jaime at 17?
403;00:27:39,366;00:27:41,951;Better than you.
404;00:27:42,536;00:27:45,038;Some men have a gift for this sort of thing,
405;00:27:45,122;00:27:46,956;some don't.
406;00:27:47,041;00:27:48,750;His place is not on the battlefield.
407;00:27:48,917;00:27:51,002;It's not on the throne, either,
408;00:27:51,086;00:27:52,837;sadly for all of us.
409;00:27:56,592;00:27:58,176;Do you think I'm an idiot?
410;00:27:58,260;00:28:00,511;No, I'd say you possess
410;00:27:58,260;00:28:00,511;above-average intelligence.
411;00:28:00,596;00:28:03,014;You shipped off my only daughter.
412;00:28:03,098;00:28:06,100;And now you want to send my eldest son
412;00:28:03,098;00:28:06,100;to the battlefield to die.
413;00:28:06,185;00:28:08,519;He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him.
414;00:28:08,604;00:28:11,522;He has the finest armor gold can buy.
415;00:28:11,607;00:28:13,191;He needs to be out there.
416;00:28:13,275;00:28:16,861;The men will fight more fiercely
416;00:28:13,275;00:28:16,861;seeing their king fighting beside them
417;00:28:16,945;00:28:19,489;instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts.
418;00:28:20,491;00:28:21,908;Any dessert?
419;00:28:22,701;00:28:25,495;Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
420;00:28:25,579;00:28:28,873;Because he has
420;00:28:25,579;00:28:28,873;thousands of spies in his employ.
421;00:28:28,957;00:28:31,751;Because he knows everything we do
421;00:28:28,957;00:28:31,751;before we do it.
422;00:28:31,835;00:28:33,211;Because he doesn't have a cock.
423;00:28:33,962;00:28:35,546;Neither do you.
424;00:28:37,132;00:28:39,717;Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.
425;00:28:39,802;00:28:43,846;You, on the other hand,
425;00:28:39,802;00:28:43,846;are as big a fool as every other man.
426;00:28:44,181;00:28:47,725;That little worm between your legs
426;00:28:44,181;00:28:47,725;does half your thinking.
427;00:28:47,810;00:28:49,477;It's not that little.
428;00:28:56,402;00:28:57,735;Why are you smiling?
429;00:28:58,320;00:28:59,821;Because I'm happy.
430;00:29:00,197;00:29:01,864;And why are you happy?
431;00:29:06,036;00:29:08,538;Because I have your little whore.
432;00:29:11,834;00:29:13,584;I thought you preferred blondes.
433;00:29:13,669;00:29:15,420;Such a droll little fellow.
434;00:29:15,504;00:29:17,255;Tell me, have you married this one yet?
435;00:29:18,090;00:29:19,298;No?
436;00:29:19,758;00:29:22,135;Good. Father will be so pleased.
437;00:29:22,219;00:29:24,262;Why do you care who I fuck?
438;00:29:24,346;00:29:26,931;Because a Lannister always pays her debts.
439;00:29:27,015;00:29:28,474;You stole my only daughter,
440;00:29:28,767;00:29:30,184;you plot to have Joffrey killed.
441;00:29:30,436;00:29:33,229;This is madness. Stannis will be here in days.
442;00:29:33,313;00:29:34,605;You need me.
442;00:29:33,313;00:29:34,605;For what?
443;00:29:34,690;00:29:36,524;Your skill in battle?
444;00:29:38,527;00:29:40,528;Pretty thing, your whore.
445;00:29:41,530;00:29:42,947;Lovely body.
446;00:29:43,490;00:29:45,741;The bruises will heal in time.
447;00:29:47,411;00:29:48,995;Where did you find her?
448;00:29:49,079;00:29:51,330;Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers.
449;00:29:51,707;00:29:54,250;Really, a Lannister lion necklace?
450;00:29:55,335;00:29:57,962;You need to hide your secret whores
450;00:29:55,335;00:29:57,962;more carefully.
451;00:29:58,046;00:30:00,923;You've forgotten the most
451;00:29:58,046;00:30:00,923;important thing about whores.
452;00:30:01,008;00:30:02,008;Oh?
453;00:30:02,968;00:30:05,511;Well, you're the expert. Tell me.
454;00:30:06,722;00:30:08,556;You don't buy them,
455;00:30:08,640;00:30:10,475;you only rent them.
456;00:30:11,351;00:30:14,270;You're usually a better liar, baby brother.
457;00:30:14,980;00:30:16,772;This one you like.
458;00:30:17,649;00:30:19,734;You like her very much.
459;00:30:20,903;00:30:21,986;Could it be love?
460;00:30:23,197;00:30:25,907;Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough.
461;00:30:25,991;00:30:27,492;Unless Joffrey is hurt.
462;00:30:27,576;00:30:30,870;And then every wound he suffers,
462;00:30:27,576;00:30:30,870;she'll suffer, too.
463;00:30:31,288;00:30:32,914;And if he dies,
464;00:30:33,790;00:30:38,836;there isn't a man alive who could devise
464;00:30:33,790;00:30:38,836;a more painful death for your little cunt.
465;00:30:41,798;00:30:45,176;And how do I know
465;00:30:41,798;00:30:45,176;you haven't killed her already?
466;00:30:45,260;00:30:46,469;Would you like to see her?
467;00:30:46,553;00:30:48,179;I thought you might.
468;00:30:48,263;00:30:51,140;Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore.
469;00:31:23,549;00:31:25,550;I'm sorry they hurt you.
470;00:31:26,969;00:31:28,761;You must be brave.
471;00:31:34,268;00:31:36,477;I promise I will free you.
472;00:31:38,605;00:31:39,772;Don't forget me.
473;00:31:40,482;00:31:41,649;Never.
474;00:32:00,210;00:32:02,336;I will hurt you for this.
475;00:32:02,796;00:32:06,424;A day will come
475;00:32:02,796;00:32:06,424;when you think you're safe and happy,
476;00:32:06,508;00:32:10,011;and yourjoy will turn to ashes in your mouth.
477;00:32:11,471;00:32:13,097;And you will know the debt is paid.
478;00:32:13,890;00:32:16,017;Get out.
479;00:32:27,946;00:32:29,155;Shae!
480;00:32:32,367;00:32:34,493;I've been waiting all night.
481;00:32:34,870;00:32:36,162;What is wrong?
482;00:32:37,039;00:32:38,164;You're beautiful.
483;00:32:46,381;00:32:48,382;Then why do you look sad?
484;00:32:55,515;00:32:57,099;We have to be more careful.
485;00:32:57,184;00:33:00,102;Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.
486;00:33:00,729;00:33:03,731;There are people who want to hurt me.
487;00:33:03,815;00:33:05,775;I know. I won't let them.
488;00:33:06,151;00:33:08,569;I'll cut off their faces. I will.
489;00:33:13,325;00:33:15,743;I would kill for you. Do you know that?
490;00:33:17,663;00:33:20,498;I expect I'll have to before this is over.
491;00:33:23,377;00:33:24,752;You're mine.
492;00:33:26,380;00:33:28,047;I'm yours.
493;00:33:29,132;00:33:30,675;Promise me.
494;00:33:34,429;00:33:36,681;I'm yours, and you are mine.
495;00:33:48,902;00:33:50,653;Still no word?
496;00:33:51,113;00:33:54,281;We've sent a dozen ravens.
496;00:33:51,113;00:33:54,281;None have returned.
497;00:33:56,201;00:33:59,203;My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell.
498;00:33:59,287;00:34:01,330;Once he captures the castle...
498;00:33:59,287;00:34:01,330;Theon has my brothers.
499;00:34:01,415;00:34:05,126;If we storm the castle...
499;00:34:01,415;00:34:05,126;He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.
500;00:34:06,503;00:34:10,297;They're his only hope
500;00:34:06,503;00:34:10,297;of escaping the North with his head.
501;00:34:11,675;00:34:13,634;Send word to your son.
502;00:34:15,011;00:34:19,598;Any ironborn who surrender will be allowed
502;00:34:15,011;00:34:19,598;to return safely to their homes.
503;00:34:20,308;00:34:23,185;A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace.
503;00:34:20,308;00:34:23,185;Too much...
504;00:34:23,270;00:34:26,939;Any ironborn with the exception
504;00:34:23,270;00:34:26,939;of Theon Greyjoy.
505;00:34:28,024;00:34:30,067;He betrayed our cause.
506;00:34:30,485;00:34:32,820;He betrayed me.
507;00:34:32,904;00:34:35,614;And we will hunt him down
507;00:34:32,904;00:34:35,614;no matter where he runs.
508;00:34:35,824;00:34:38,909;I expect his countrymen will turn on him
508;00:34:35,824;00:34:38,909;the minute they hear the offer.
509;00:34:42,247;00:34:44,790;Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace.
510;00:34:44,875;00:34:46,292;My lady.
511;00:34:58,472;00:34:59,972;How are you?
512;00:35:01,558;00:35:03,184;How am I?
513;00:35:03,268;00:35:05,436;I've had to arrest my mother.
514;00:35:05,520;00:35:07,605;The Lannisters have my sisters.
515;00:35:07,689;00:35:10,357;The man I considered my closest friend
516;00:35:10,442;00:35:12,651;has seized my home and my brothers.
517;00:35:12,736;00:35:15,529;I'm fighting a war and I don't know
517;00:35:12,736;00:35:15,529;if I should march south or north.
518;00:35:15,614;00:35:18,908;I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.
519;00:35:18,992;00:35:20,367;No.
520;00:35:20,452;00:35:21,827;Forgive me.
521;00:35:22,496;00:35:23,704;You're being kind.
522;00:35:24,372;00:35:26,916;I have no right.
522;00:35:24,372;00:35:26,916;You have every right.
523;00:35:27,000;00:35:28,334;You're a king.
524;00:35:28,418;00:35:30,503;That's not the kind of king I want to be.
525;00:35:31,505;00:35:33,130;What kind do you want to be?
526;00:35:33,215;00:35:34,215;I don't know.
527;00:35:34,299;00:35:35,716;The good kind.
528;00:35:39,638;00:35:41,388;Most kings grew up as princes.
529;00:35:41,473;00:35:44,767;They spend their whole lives
529;00:35:41,473;00:35:44,767;preparing for the crown.
530;00:35:44,851;00:35:47,478;I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
531;00:35:49,564;00:35:52,107;I was raised to be a proper little lady,
532;00:35:52,192;00:35:57,321;to play the harp and dance the latest steps
532;00:35:52,192;00:35:57,321;and recite Valyrian poetry.
533;00:35:57,405;00:35:58,739;I'd like to hear you play the harp.
534;00:35:58,824;00:36:00,866;No. No, you would not.
535;00:36:06,081;00:36:09,250;How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry
536;00:36:10,043;00:36:12,127;to sawing off men's feet?
537;00:36:22,222;00:36:24,348;When I was 12,
538;00:36:24,432;00:36:27,059;my mother and father went to a wedding.
539;00:36:27,143;00:36:30,312;Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know.
540;00:36:30,397;00:36:33,107;And they left me with my little brother.
541;00:36:33,984;00:36:38,320;The second afternoon they were gone
541;00:36:33,984;00:36:38,320;was the hottest day in the three-year summer.
542;00:36:39,114;00:36:43,075;We couldn't bear to be inside,
542;00:36:39,114;00:36:43,075;so we ran down to the Rhoyne.
543;00:36:43,159;00:36:46,453;Every child in Volantis
543;00:36:43,159;00:36:46,453;was in the Rhoyne that day.
544;00:36:47,914;00:36:49,957;The rich, the poor, we were all there.
545;00:36:50,041;00:36:53,419;Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands.
546;00:36:53,628;00:36:56,922;Drummers were playing
546;00:36:53,628;00:36:56,922;for coppers on the east bank.
547;00:37:00,677;00:37:02,553;I was treading water,
548;00:37:03,388;00:37:05,514;talking to a friend,
549;00:37:05,599;00:37:08,726;when I realized I hadn't seen my brother.
550;00:37:09,477;00:37:11,353;I called his name.
551;00:37:12,564;00:37:15,149;Then I started screaming his name.
552;00:37:16,985;00:37:18,485;And then I saw him...
553;00:37:19,487;00:37:21,488;floating face down.
554;00:37:23,283;00:37:25,993;My heart just... stopped.
555;00:37:26,077;00:37:27,453;I was...
556;00:37:31,666;00:37:34,001;I dragged him from the water.
557;00:37:34,836;00:37:36,962;My friend helped me, I think.
558;00:37:37,047;00:37:39,006;I don't even remember.
559;00:37:41,676;00:37:43,344;He was so little.
560;00:37:44,763;00:37:47,473;Then we pulled him onto the riverbank.
561;00:37:49,059;00:37:52,436;And I screamed at him and I shook him.
562;00:37:53,980;00:37:55,814;And he was dead.
563;00:37:57,525;00:37:58,984;Just dead.
564;00:38:02,906;00:38:04,615;A man ran over.
565;00:38:07,118;00:38:09,620;He had a fish tattoo on his face.
566;00:38:11,539;00:38:13,582;In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos.
567;00:38:13,667;00:38:17,044;So you know what they are
567;00:38:13,667;00:38:17,044;without having to talk to them.
568;00:38:17,337;00:38:20,130;And this man worked on a fishing boat.
569;00:38:20,215;00:38:22,633;And he pushed me out of the way.
570;00:38:23,635;00:38:28,347;You have to understand,
570;00:38:23,635;00:38:28,347;for a slave to push a highborn girl,
571;00:38:28,431;00:38:31,558;that's death for the man, a terrible death.
572;00:38:32,978;00:38:35,312;But he pushed me out of the way,
573;00:38:36,606;00:38:40,734;and he started pressing on my brother's chest
574;00:38:40,819;00:38:44,321;again and again and again,
575;00:38:45,031;00:38:48,492;until my brother spat out
576;00:38:48,576;00:38:52,079;half of the Rhoyne and cried out.
577;00:38:52,163;00:38:55,791;And the man cradled his head
577;00:38:52,163;00:38:55,791;and told him to be calm.
578;00:39:02,424;00:39:04,675;I decided two things that day.
579;00:39:04,759;00:39:10,264;I would not waste my years planning dances
579;00:39:04,759;00:39:10,264;and masquerades with the other noble ladies.
580;00:39:11,307;00:39:13,767;And when I came of age,
581;00:39:15,353;00:39:18,188;I would never live in a slave city again.
582;00:39:25,447;00:39:26,947;I'm sorry, Your Grace.
583;00:39:27,032;00:39:30,367;You told me of your problems
583;00:39:27,032;00:39:30,367;and I've blathered on.
584;00:39:30,452;00:39:33,203;I don't want to marry the Frey girl.
585;00:39:36,833;00:39:38,125;I don't want you to marry her.
586;00:39:42,130;00:39:44,298;But you needed that bridge.
587;00:39:46,968;00:39:48,969;I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.
588;00:40:55,203;00:40:57,454;The sour cherries
588;00:40:55,203;00:40:57,454;was all crushed up and ready.
589;00:40:57,539;00:40:58,622;Shut up.
590;00:40:58,706;00:41:01,542;Probably in the piecrust by now.
590;00:40:58,706;00:41:01,542;In the oven.
591;00:41:02,752;00:41:04,044;The nice, warm oven.
592;00:41:04,129;00:41:06,255;Shut up. What did you bring?
593;00:41:06,840;00:41:09,133;The cheese could be better.
594;00:41:09,217;00:41:10,676;I did get some nice sausages.
595;00:41:10,760;00:41:13,303;What did he want us
595;00:41:10,760;00:41:13,303;to do about those guards?
596;00:41:13,388;00:41:14,888;He didn't say.
597;00:41:14,973;00:41:16,640;He just said, Walk through the gates.
598;00:41:16,724;00:41:17,850;What about the guards?
599;00:41:17,934;00:41:19,810;He didn't say anything about the guards.
600;00:41:19,894;00:41:21,478;What, he left that bit out?
601;00:41:21,563;00:41:23,105;It's a pretty important part, don't you think?
602;00:41:23,731;00:41:25,274;We have to trust him.
603;00:41:25,358;00:41:26,441;Trust him?
604;00:41:26,526;00:41:29,653;You trusted him to fight with us
604;00:41:26,526;00:41:29,653;when you set him free and he ran.
605;00:41:29,737;00:41:31,697;I want to go back to the kitchens.
605;00:41:29,737;00:41:31,697;Shut up.
606;00:41:31,990;00:41:34,074;Stay here if you're afraid.
607;00:41:36,911;00:41:38,453;Arry, don't.
608;00:42:07,275;00:42:08,400;Away!
609;00:42:08,484;00:42:09,776;Reset!
610;00:42:18,077;00:42:21,121;If the wind holds,
610;00:42:18,077;00:42:21,121;we'll reach King's Landing in a day.
611;00:42:21,206;00:42:22,539;Will it hold?
612;00:42:22,916;00:42:25,918;Can't make promises for the wind,
612;00:42:22,916;00:42:25,918;Your Grace.
613;00:42:26,711;00:42:28,378;Again, pull!
614;00:42:32,008;00:42:34,218;I admire you, Ser Davos.
615;00:42:34,302;00:42:37,512;I thank you, Your Grace. Pleased to hear it.
616;00:42:37,597;00:42:41,558;Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight
616;00:42:37,597;00:42:41,558;and think they insult you.
617;00:42:41,643;00:42:43,894;So you take the onion for your sigil,
618;00:42:43,978;00:42:46,396;sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.
619;00:42:46,481;00:42:48,440;My son wishes me to change it.
620;00:42:48,524;00:42:51,818;Three mermen with tridents,
620;00:42:48,524;00:42:51,818;something like that.
621;00:42:51,903;00:42:55,906;I understand why
621;00:42:51,903;00:42:55,906;the older families look down at me.
622;00:42:55,990;00:42:57,908;Do you? Why?
623;00:42:57,992;00:43:00,953;My father was a crabber.
623;00:42:57,992;00:43:00,953;And?
624;00:43:01,037;00:43:05,040;Well, sons of lords don't like
624;00:43:01,037;00:43:05,040;to break bread with sons of crabbers.
625;00:43:05,124;00:43:06,583;Our hands stink.
626;00:43:06,668;00:43:09,044;And where were those lords
626;00:43:06,668;00:43:09,044;when Storm's End starved?
627;00:43:09,545;00:43:11,546;Many fought bravely for your brother.
628;00:43:11,631;00:43:14,258;Many fought for the Mad King.
629;00:43:14,342;00:43:17,719;You defend these men
629;00:43:14,342;00:43:17,719;who insult you behind your back.
630;00:43:18,638;00:43:20,472;Some are happy to do it to my face.
631;00:43:20,556;00:43:22,432;We were forgotten.
632;00:43:22,892;00:43:25,227;Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes.
633;00:43:25,311;00:43:29,398;The glorious rebels
633;00:43:25,311;00:43:29,398;marching from battle to battle,
634;00:43:29,482;00:43:31,692;liberating towns
634;00:43:29,482;00:43:31,692;from the yoke of the Mad King,
635;00:43:31,776;00:43:34,111;while I held Storm's End with 500 men.
636;00:43:34,195;00:43:36,613;No one has forgotten, Your Grace.
636;00:43:34,195;00:43:36,613;No? Robert did.
637;00:43:36,698;00:43:39,908;He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war.
637;00:43:36,698;00:43:39,908;Renly never fought a day in his life.
638;00:43:39,993;00:43:43,537;He was only a boy.
638;00:43:39,993;00:43:43,537;Then why'd he give him Storm's End?
639;00:43:46,791;00:43:48,834;First, we ate the horses.
640;00:43:48,918;00:43:52,462;We weren't riding anywhere,
640;00:43:48,918;00:43:52,462;not with the castle surrounded.
641;00:43:52,547;00:43:54,631;We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses.
642;00:43:54,716;00:43:57,968;Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine.
643;00:43:58,052;00:43:59,803;I do like dogs.
644;00:43:59,887;00:44:03,432;Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them.
644;00:43:59,887;00:44:03,432;Then the rats.
645;00:44:04,559;00:44:07,644;The night before you slipped through,
645;00:44:04,559;00:44:07,644;I thought my wife was dying.
646;00:44:07,729;00:44:09,938;She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail.
647;00:44:11,190;00:44:13,483;And then you made it through the lines.
648;00:44:13,568;00:44:16,820;Slipped right through
648;00:44:13,568;00:44:16,820;in your little black sailboat with your onions.
649;00:44:16,904;00:44:19,656;And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.
650;00:44:19,741;00:44:21,992;Every man in Storm's End wanted
650;00:44:19,741;00:44:21,992;to kiss you that night.
651;00:44:22,076;00:44:24,369;I was relieved they did not.
652;00:44:26,748;00:44:29,916;Robert told me to hold Storm's End,
652;00:44:26,748;00:44:29,916;so I held it.
653;00:44:31,419;00:44:34,421;Then he told me he was giving it to Renly,
653;00:44:31,419;00:44:34,421;so I gave it up.
654;00:44:34,922;00:44:37,215;Insult or no, I gave it up.
655;00:44:37,300;00:44:39,176;Because Robert was my older brother,
655;00:44:37,300;00:44:39,176;and he was the king
656;00:44:39,260;00:44:41,345;and I've always done my duty.
657;00:44:41,804;00:44:45,682;But now, I'm the rightful king
657;00:44:41,804;00:44:45,682;by every law of Westeros.
658;00:44:45,767;00:44:47,809;And when I sit the Iron Throne,
658;00:44:45,767;00:44:47,809;you'll be my Hand.
659;00:44:51,022;00:44:52,564;Your Grace,
660;00:44:54,942;00:44:56,943;I pray I serve you well.
661;00:44:58,279;00:45:00,781;I expect you'll be the first crabber's son
661;00:44:58,279;00:45:00,781;to wear the badge.
662;00:45:05,912;00:45:09,289;You're the Master of Whisperers.
662;00:45:05,912;00:45:09,289;You're supposed to know everything.
663;00:45:09,374;00:45:12,334;No man can be in all rooms at all times.
664;00:45:12,418;00:45:15,212;I have many little birds in the North, my lord,
665;00:45:15,296;00:45:19,716;but I haven't heard their songs
665;00:45:15,296;00:45:19,716;since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.
666;00:45:19,801;00:45:23,595;The Stark forces are distracted.
666;00:45:19,801;00:45:23,595;Now is the time to strike.
667;00:45:23,679;00:45:25,305;To strike?
668;00:45:25,390;00:45:29,017;My dear nephew, you do see these men
668;00:45:25,390;00:45:29,017;preparing the walls for siege?
669;00:45:29,102;00:45:32,646;You do understand
669;00:45:29,102;00:45:32,646;Stannis Baratheon sails this way?
670;00:45:32,730;00:45:35,023;If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores
670;00:45:32,730;00:45:35,023;of King's Landing,
671;00:45:35,108;00:45:36,900;I'll ride out to greet him.
672;00:45:36,984;00:45:38,819;A brave choice, Your Grace.
673;00:45:38,903;00:45:41,655;I'm sure your men will line up behind you.
674;00:45:41,948;00:45:44,991;They say Stannis never smiles.
675;00:45:45,076;00:45:47,494;I'll give him a red smile
676;00:45:47,578;00:45:49,287;from ear to ear.
677;00:45:54,085;00:45:56,294;Imagine Stannis' terror.
678;00:45:57,338;00:45:58,839;I am trying.
679;00:46:00,341;00:46:01,925;You're an intelligent man.
680;00:46:02,009;00:46:03,635;I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
681;00:46:03,719;00:46:07,514;Oh, no one disputes that, my lord,
681;00:46:03,719;00:46:07,514;not even the multitudes who despise you.
682;00:46:07,849;00:46:10,517;I wish we could converse
682;00:46:07,849;00:46:10,517;as two honest, intelligent men.
683;00:46:10,601;00:46:12,185;I wish we could, too.
684;00:46:14,730;00:46:16,356;What do you want?
685;00:46:16,732;00:46:18,150;Tell me.
686;00:46:19,026;00:46:22,362;If we're going to play, you'll have to start.
687;00:46:27,160;00:46:30,704;My brother was
687;00:46:27,160;00:46:30,704;the youngest Kingsguard in history.
688;00:46:31,873;00:46:34,749;My sister became queen at the age of 19.
689;00:46:36,878;00:46:38,670;When I reached manhood,
690;00:46:38,754;00:46:42,507;my father put me in charge of all the drains
690;00:46:38,754;00:46:42,507;and cisterns in Casterly Rock.
691;00:46:42,758;00:46:44,759;A most highborn plumber.
692;00:46:44,844;00:46:46,803;The water never flowed better.
693;00:46:46,888;00:46:49,639;And all the shit found its way to the sea.
694;00:46:50,057;00:46:52,726;I never expected to have any real power.
695;00:46:52,810;00:46:54,728;So when my father named me acting Hand...
696;00:46:54,812;00:46:56,730;You're quite good at being Hand, you know?
697;00:46:57,064;00:46:59,900;Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men.
698;00:46:59,984;00:47:01,985;Honorable men.
699;00:47:02,069;00:47:04,863;But they disdained the game
699;00:47:02,069;00:47:04,863;and those who played.
700;00:47:04,947;00:47:07,199;You enjoy the game.
700;00:47:04,947;00:47:07,199;I do.
701;00:47:08,326;00:47:09,868;Last thing I expected.
702;00:47:09,952;00:47:11,286;And you play it well.
703;00:47:11,370;00:47:13,497;I'd like to keep playing it.
704;00:47:16,083;00:47:19,127;If Stannis breaches the gates,
704;00:47:16,083;00:47:19,127;the game is over.
705;00:47:19,212;00:47:23,131;They say he burns his enemies alive
705;00:47:19,212;00:47:23,131;to honor the Lord of Light.
706;00:47:24,258;00:47:26,009;The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned,
707;00:47:26,093;00:47:28,678;the Drowned God wants them drowned.
708;00:47:28,763;00:47:30,597;Why are all the gods such vicious cunts?
709;00:47:31,766;00:47:34,309;Where is the god of tits and wine?
710;00:47:34,977;00:47:39,105;In the Summer Isles,
710;00:47:34,977;00:47:39,105;they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats.
711;00:47:39,690;00:47:42,108;We should sail there immediately.
712;00:47:43,778;00:47:46,363;This morning, I heard a song
713;00:47:47,198;00:47:50,283;all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste.
714;00:47:50,868;00:47:52,285;Daenerys Targaryen lives.
715;00:47:54,205;00:47:57,249;A girl at the edge of the world
715;00:47:54,205;00:47:57,249;is the least of our problems.
716;00:47:57,333;00:47:59,251;She has three dragons.
717;00:48:01,170;00:48:03,338;But even if what they say is true,
718;00:48:03,422;00:48:06,299;it'll be years before they are fully grown.
719;00:48:06,926;00:48:09,636;And then there will be nowhere to hide.
720;00:48:10,680;00:48:12,347;One game at a time, my friend.
721;00:48:22,900;00:48:24,901;Careful, Khaleesi.
722;00:48:24,986;00:48:29,447;Xaro owns this city and the warlocks
722;00:48:24,986;00:48:29,447;have a thousand eyes watching for you.
723;00:48:30,908;00:48:32,367;I found one.
724;00:48:33,202;00:48:35,453;A ship with a good captain.
725;00:48:35,538;00:48:37,247;She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.
726;00:48:37,331;00:48:38,707;Astapor?
727;00:48:38,791;00:48:40,041;We cannot stay here.
728;00:48:40,126;00:48:43,253;They have my dragons.
728;00:48:40,126;00:48:43,253;A mother does not flee without her children.
729;00:48:43,337;00:48:45,297;They're not your children.
730;00:48:46,257;00:48:49,134;I know they call you the Mother of Dragons
730;00:48:46,257;00:48:49,134;and I know you love them,
731;00:48:49,218;00:48:50,760;but you didn't grow them in your womb.
732;00:48:50,845;00:48:53,305;They didn't suckle at your breast.
732;00:48:50,845;00:48:53,305;They are dragons, Khaleesi.
733;00:48:53,806;00:48:55,807;And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.
734;00:48:55,891;00:48:59,519;You should sail to Astapor.
734;00:48:55,891;00:48:59,519;I'm sure you'll be safe there.
735;00:49:01,689;00:49:03,940;You know I would die for you.
736;00:49:04,900;00:49:07,319;I will never abandon you.
737;00:49:07,403;00:49:09,404;I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.
738;00:49:09,488;00:49:11,531;Then serve me.
739;00:49:11,616;00:49:15,160;If my dragons are in
739;00:49:11,616;00:49:15,160;the House of the Undying, then take me there.
740;00:49:15,244;00:49:17,120;That's what the warlock wants.
741;00:49:17,204;00:49:18,830;He told you so himself.
742;00:49:18,914;00:49:21,708;If you enter that place,
742;00:49:18,914;00:49:21,708;you will never leave again.
743;00:49:21,792;00:49:24,794;His magic is strong.
743;00:49:21,792;00:49:24,794;And what of my magic?
744;00:49:24,879;00:49:27,881;You saw me step into the fire.
744;00:49:24,879;00:49:27,881;You watched the witch burn.
745;00:49:27,965;00:49:31,176;What did the flames do to me?
745;00:49:27,965;00:49:31,176;Do you remember?
746;00:49:33,137;00:49:35,930;Until my last breath, I will remember.
747;00:49:38,017;00:49:40,727;After I have forgotten my mother's face.
748;00:49:45,483;00:49:47,317;They are my children.
749;00:49:48,402;00:49:51,863;And they are the only children I will ever have.
750;00:49:58,120;00:49:59,746;Take me to them.
751;00:50:12,093;00:50:13,885;We should bury them.
752;00:50:14,637;00:50:17,931;I'd leave 'em up a few more days.
752;00:50:14,637;00:50:17,931;Sends a message.
753;00:50:18,933;00:50:21,267;If they haven't got the damn message yet,
753;00:50:18,933;00:50:21,267;a few more days won't help.
754;00:50:22,436;00:50:23,978;As you say.
755;00:50:24,063;00:50:27,232;But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer.
756;00:50:27,983;00:50:31,111;What's this?
756;00:50:27,983;00:50:31,111;Gold for the farmer.
757;00:50:31,612;00:50:33,238;For his trouble.
758;00:50:34,115;00:50:35,240;His troubles are done.
759;00:50:36,575;00:50:38,702;He's feeding the crops now.
760;00:50:38,953;00:50:40,453;His wife, too.
761;00:50:42,623;00:50:45,709;You want to keep a man silent,
761;00:50:42,623;00:50:45,709;you silence him.
762;00:51:04,979;00:51:07,981;Got as far
762;00:51:04,979;00:51:07,981;as the farm and then doubled back.
763;00:51:10,401;00:51:13,611;Walked through the stream
763;00:51:10,401;00:51:13,611;to throw off the hounds.
764;00:51:15,656;00:51:19,159;Hoped this would be the last place
764;00:51:15,656;00:51:19,159;they'd think to look.
765;00:51:21,120;00:51:22,787;You're right
766;00:51:22,872;00:51:24,330;so far.
767;00:51:25,958;00:51:29,169;Who was that
767;00:51:25,958;00:51:29,169;out there hung up at the gates?
768;00:51:31,088;00:51:33,590;Must have been the farmer's boys.
769;00:51:34,842;00:51:37,051;He killed them and burned them
770;00:51:38,679;00:51:41,431;and passed them off as the little lords?
771;00:51:42,850;00:51:44,517;They mustn't know.
772;00:51:45,853;00:51:48,354;Bran would blame himself.
773;00:51:48,439;00:51:50,315;They'll never hear it from me.
774;00:51:51,984;00:51:54,569;The little lads have suffered enough.
