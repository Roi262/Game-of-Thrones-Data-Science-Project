3;00:01:56,389;00:01:59,124;Yah!
3;00:01:56,389;00:01:59,124;Left high, left low.
4;00:02:16,710;00:02:18,778;Right low,
4;00:02:16,710;00:02:18,778;lunge right.
5;00:02:21,948;00:02:24,649;You break anything,
5;00:02:21,948;00:02:24,649;the Septa will have my head.
6;00:02:24,683;00:02:26,484;What is--
7;00:02:37,561;00:02:40,329;Your sister knew perfectly
7;00:02:37,561;00:02:40,329;well we were to leave today.
8;00:02:40,363;00:02:42,531;How she could forget--
8;00:02:40,363;00:02:42,531;She didn't forget.
9;00:02:42,565;00:02:45,267;She's with her dancing master.
9;00:02:42,565;00:02:45,267;She's with him every morning.
10;00:02:45,301;00:02:47,837;She always comes back with scrapes
10;00:02:45,301;00:02:47,837;and bruises. She's so clumsy.
11;00:02:47,871;00:02:49,772;Hush!
12;00:02:49,807;00:02:52,008;Go back to your room.
13;00:02:52,943;00:02:54,345;Bar the doors
14;00:02:54,379;00:02:56,580;and do not open them for anyone
14;00:02:54,379;00:02:56,580;you do not know.
15;00:02:56,615;00:02:59,283;What is it? What's happening?
15;00:02:56,615;00:02:59,283;Do as I told you.
16;00:02:59,318;00:03:01,119;Run!
17;00:03:04,857;00:03:06,524;This way!
18;00:03:20,036;00:03:22,204;Left, right.
18;00:03:20,036;00:03:22,204;Rah!
19;00:03:22,238;00:03:23,939;Now you are dead.
20;00:03:23,973;00:03:25,941;You said right,
21;00:03:25,975;00:03:27,843;but you went left.
22;00:03:27,877;00:03:30,078;And now you are
22;00:03:27,877;00:03:30,078;a dead girl.
23;00:03:30,112;00:03:31,713;Only 'cause you lied.
24;00:03:31,748;00:03:34,382;My tongue lied.
24;00:03:31,748;00:03:34,382;My eyes
25;00:03:34,416;00:03:37,619;shouted the truth.
25;00:03:34,416;00:03:37,619;You were not seeing.
26;00:03:37,653;00:03:40,155;I was so.
26;00:03:37,653;00:03:40,155;I watched, but you--
27;00:03:40,189;00:03:43,659;watching is not seeing,
27;00:03:40,189;00:03:43,659;dead girl.
28;00:03:45,729;00:03:49,365;The seeing,
28;00:03:45,729;00:03:49,365;the true seeing,
29;00:03:49,399;00:03:51,835;that is the heart
29;00:03:49,399;00:03:51,835;of swordplay.
30;00:03:56,341;00:03:58,843;Arya Stark,
30;00:03:56,341;00:03:58,843;come with us.
31;00:03:58,877;00:04:01,613;Your father wants
31;00:03:58,877;00:04:01,613;to see you.
32;00:04:01,647;00:04:04,015;And why is it
33;00:04:04,049;00:04:06,484;that Lord Eddard is
33;00:04:04,049;00:04:06,484;sending Lannister men
34;00:04:06,518;00:04:08,720;in place of his own?
34;00:04:06,518;00:04:08,720;I am wondering.
35;00:04:08,754;00:04:11,823;Mind your place,
35;00:04:08,754;00:04:11,823;dancing master.
36;00:04:11,857;00:04:14,392;This is no
36;00:04:11,857;00:04:14,392;concern of yours.
37;00:04:14,426;00:04:16,261;My father wouldn't
37;00:04:14,426;00:04:16,261;send you.
38;00:04:19,799;00:04:22,500;And I don't have to go
38;00:04:19,799;00:04:22,500;with you if I don't want.
39;00:04:22,534;00:04:24,869;Take her.
40;00:04:24,903;00:04:28,873;Are you men or snakes, that you
40;00:04:24,903;00:04:28,873;would threaten a child?
41;00:04:28,907;00:04:31,042;Get out of my way,
41;00:04:28,907;00:04:31,042;little man.
42;00:04:31,076;00:04:34,545;I am Syrio Forel...
43;00:04:34,579;00:04:36,580;Foreign bastard.
44;00:04:39,317;00:04:43,020;...And you will be speaking
44;00:04:39,317;00:04:43,020;to me with more respect.
45;00:04:43,054;00:04:45,656;Kill the Braavosi.
45;00:04:43,054;00:04:45,656;Bring the girl.
46;00:04:47,193;00:04:49,928;Arya child, we are done
46;00:04:47,193;00:04:49,928;with dancing for the day.
47;00:04:49,962;00:04:52,597;Run to your father.
48;00:05:13,086;00:05:15,821;Bloody oafs.
49;00:05:15,856;00:05:17,723;Be gone now, Arya.
50;00:05:17,758;00:05:20,327;Come with me.
50;00:05:17,758;00:05:20,327;Run.
51;00:05:21,963;00:05:24,965;The first sword of Braavos
51;00:05:21,963;00:05:24,965;does not run.
52;00:05:37,111;00:05:39,012;What do we say
53;00:05:39,047;00:05:40,981;to the God of death?
54;00:05:41,015;00:05:42,883;Not today.
55;00:05:44,418;00:05:45,852;Go.
56;00:06:11,410;00:06:13,512;Not today.
56;00:06:11,410;00:06:13,512;Not today.
57;00:06:23,056;00:06:24,857;Stay away from me.
58;00:06:24,891;00:06:26,558;I'll tell my father.
59;00:06:26,593;00:06:29,561;I'll-- I'll tell
59;00:06:26,593;00:06:29,561;the Queen.
60;00:06:29,595;00:06:33,298;Who do you think sent me?
61;00:06:45,811;00:06:47,679;Needle.
62;00:06:50,917;00:06:52,951;There she is.
63;00:06:52,986;00:06:55,253;What do you want?
63;00:06:52,986;00:06:55,253;I want you, wolf girl.
64;00:06:55,288;00:06:56,989;Come here.
64;00:06:55,288;00:06:56,989;Leave me be.
65;00:06:57,023;00:06:59,090;My father's a lord.
65;00:06:57,023;00:06:59,090;He'll reward you.
66;00:06:59,125;00:07:00,692;She'll reward me--
66;00:06:59,125;00:07:00,692;the Queen!
67;00:07:00,726;00:07:02,894;Stay away!
68;00:07:31,992;00:07:35,628;Lord Stark,
68;00:07:31,992;00:07:35,628;you must be thirsty.
69;00:07:37,064;00:07:39,232;Varys.
70;00:07:41,035;00:07:43,336;I promise you
70;00:07:41,035;00:07:43,336;it isn't poisoned.
71;00:07:45,006;00:07:47,308;Why is it no one ever
71;00:07:45,006;00:07:47,308;trusts the eunuch?
72;00:07:55,851;00:07:57,619;Not so much, My Lord.
73;00:07:57,654;00:07:59,688;I would save the rest,
73;00:07:57,654;00:07:59,688;if I were you.
74;00:07:59,722;00:08:03,592;Hide it. Men have been known to die
74;00:07:59,722;00:08:03,592;of thirst in these cells.
75;00:08:05,462;00:08:07,964;What about
75;00:08:05,462;00:08:07,964;my daughters?
76;00:08:07,998;00:08:10,533;The younger one seems
76;00:08:07,998;00:08:10,533;to have escaped the castle.
77;00:08:10,568;00:08:12,769;Even my little birds
77;00:08:10,568;00:08:12,769;cannot find her.
78;00:08:12,803;00:08:16,339;And Sansa?
78;00:08:12,803;00:08:16,339;Still engaged to Joffrey.
79;00:08:16,373;00:08:19,943;Cersei will keep her close. The rest
79;00:08:16,373;00:08:19,943;of your household though--
80;00:08:19,977;00:08:22,145;all dead,
80;00:08:19,977;00:08:22,145;it grieves me to say.
81;00:08:22,179;00:08:24,447;I do so hate
81;00:08:22,179;00:08:24,447;the sight of blood.
82;00:08:25,949;00:08:28,818;You watched my men being
82;00:08:25,949;00:08:28,818;slaughtered and did nothing.
83;00:08:28,852;00:08:31,154;And would again, My Lord.
84;00:08:31,188;00:08:35,591;I was unarmed, unarmored and
84;00:08:31,188;00:08:35,591;surrounded by Lannister swords.
85;00:08:35,626;00:08:37,960;When you look at me
85;00:08:35,626;00:08:37,960;do you see a hero?
86;00:08:43,900;00:08:46,268;What madness led you
86;00:08:43,900;00:08:46,268;to tell the Queen
87;00:08:46,303;00:08:49,105;you had learned the truth
87;00:08:46,303;00:08:49,105;about Joffrey's birth?
88;00:08:51,475;00:08:53,442;The madness of mercy.
89;00:08:55,145;00:08:57,880;That she might
89;00:08:55,145;00:08:57,880;save her children.
90;00:08:57,915;00:08:59,748;Ah, the children.
91;00:08:59,783;00:09:02,652;It is always
91;00:08:59,783;00:09:02,652;the innocents who suffer.
92;00:09:02,686;00:09:05,587;It wasn't the wine that killed Robert,
92;00:09:02,686;00:09:05,587;nor the boar.
93;00:09:05,622;00:09:09,091;The wine slowed him down
93;00:09:05,622;00:09:09,091;and the boar ripped him open,
94;00:09:09,125;00:09:12,360;but it was your mercy
94;00:09:09,125;00:09:12,360;that killed the King.
95;00:09:15,931;00:09:19,300;I trust you know you are
95;00:09:15,931;00:09:19,300;a dead man, Lord Eddard?
96;00:09:24,038;00:09:26,606;The Queen
96;00:09:24,038;00:09:26,606;can't kill me.
97;00:09:26,641;00:09:29,109;Cat holds her brother.
98;00:09:29,144;00:09:31,845;The wrong brother
98;00:09:29,144;00:09:31,845;sadly.
99;00:09:31,880;00:09:33,614;And lost to her.
100;00:09:33,648;00:09:36,583;Your wife has let the Imp
100;00:09:33,648;00:09:36,583;slip through her fingers.
101;00:09:40,422;00:09:42,857;If that's true,
102;00:09:42,891;00:09:46,427;then slit my throat
102;00:09:42,891;00:09:46,427;and be done with it.
103;00:09:46,461;00:09:49,030;Not today, My Lord.
104;00:09:52,068;00:09:54,903;Tell me something, Varys.
105;00:09:54,938;00:09:57,440;Who do you truly serve?
106;00:09:58,676;00:10:01,344;The Realm, My Lord.
107;00:10:01,379;00:10:03,646;Someone must.
108;00:10:22,631;00:10:25,367;It's Othor,
108;00:10:22,631;00:10:25,367;without a doubt.
109;00:10:26,703;00:10:28,303;The other one is
109;00:10:26,703;00:10:28,303;Jafer Flowers, My Lord,
110;00:10:28,338;00:10:31,106;less the hand
110;00:10:28,338;00:10:31,106;the wolf tore off.
111;00:10:31,141;00:10:34,143;Any sign of Benjen
111;00:10:31,141;00:10:34,143;or the rest of his party?
112;00:10:34,178;00:10:37,046;Just these two,
112;00:10:34,178;00:10:37,046;My Lord.
113;00:10:37,081;00:10:39,082;Been dead awhile,
113;00:10:37,081;00:10:39,082;I'd say.
114;00:10:39,117;00:10:41,852;Mmm.
114;00:10:39,117;00:10:41,852;The smell.
115;00:10:45,258;00:10:46,858;What smell?
116;00:10:46,892;00:10:49,928;There is none.
117;00:10:49,962;00:10:53,698;If they'd be dead for a long time,
117;00:10:49,962;00:10:53,698;wouldn't there be rot?
118;00:10:53,732;00:10:56,434;We should burn them.
119;00:10:56,468;00:10:59,504;Snow's not wrong, My Lord.
119;00:10:56,468;00:10:59,504;Fire will do for them.
120;00:10:59,538;00:11:01,706;The Wildling way.
121;00:11:01,741;00:11:04,476;I want Maester Aemon
121;00:11:01,741;00:11:04,476;to examine them first.
122;00:11:04,510;00:11:07,679;You may be
122;00:11:04,510;00:11:07,679;a coward, Tarly,
123;00:11:07,713;00:11:09,848;but you're not stupid.
124;00:11:09,882;00:11:13,918;Get them inside.
124;00:11:09,882;00:11:13,918;You heard him.
125;00:11:15,454;00:11:17,422;Lord Commander,
126;00:11:17,456;00:11:19,958;Maester Aemon awaits you
126;00:11:17,456;00:11:19,958;in his chambers--
127;00:11:19,992;00:11:23,828;a raven
127;00:11:19,992;00:11:23,828;from King's Landing.
128;00:11:23,863;00:11:25,730;Come on,
128;00:11:23,863;00:11:25,730;move 'em out.
129;00:11:37,441;00:11:40,308;Bring me a horn
129;00:11:37,441;00:11:40,308;of ale, Snow,
130;00:11:40,343;00:11:43,278;and pour one
130;00:11:40,343;00:11:43,278;for yourself.
131;00:11:53,089;00:11:55,657;The King is dead.
132;00:12:07,769;00:12:10,303;Is there any word
132;00:12:07,769;00:12:10,303;of my father?
133;00:12:10,337;00:12:12,572;Sit.
134;00:12:17,077;00:12:19,611;Lord Stark has been
135;00:12:19,645;00:12:22,247;charged with treason.
136;00:12:22,281;00:12:24,683;They say he conspired
136;00:12:22,281;00:12:24,683;with Robert's brothers
137;00:12:24,717;00:12:27,453;to deny the throne
137;00:12:24,717;00:12:27,453;to Prince Joffrey.
138;00:12:39,802;00:12:43,439;I hope you're not thinking
138;00:12:39,802;00:12:43,439;of doing anything stupid.
139;00:12:43,473;00:12:46,909;Your duty lies here now.
140;00:12:46,943;00:12:50,012;My sisters were
140;00:12:46,943;00:12:50,012;in King's Landing too.
141;00:12:52,149;00:12:54,450;I'm sure they'll be
142;00:12:54,484;00:12:56,285;treated gently.
143;00:12:59,422;00:13:02,558;Your father has proved to be
143;00:12:59,422;00:13:02,558;an awful traitor, dear.
144;00:13:02,592;00:13:06,062;King Robert's body
144;00:13:02,592;00:13:06,062;was still warm
145;00:13:06,096;00:13:10,366;when Lord Eddard began plotting
145;00:13:06,096;00:13:10,366;to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.
146;00:13:10,401;00:13:12,769;He wouldn't do that.
147;00:13:12,804;00:13:15,672;He knows how much I love Joffrey.
147;00:13:12,804;00:13:15,672;He wouldn't.
148;00:13:15,707;00:13:18,809;Please, Your Grace,
148;00:13:15,707;00:13:18,809;there's been a mistake.
149;00:13:18,843;00:13:22,480;Send for my father. He'll tell you--
149;00:13:18,843;00:13:22,480;the King was his friend.
150;00:13:22,514;00:13:25,583;Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of
150;00:13:22,514;00:13:25,583;any wrong. We know that.
151;00:13:25,617;00:13:29,119;Yet you are the daughter
151;00:13:25,617;00:13:29,119;of a traitor.
152;00:13:29,153;00:13:31,321;How can I allow you
152;00:13:29,153;00:13:31,321;to marry my son?
153;00:13:31,356;00:13:34,524;A child born
153;00:13:31,356;00:13:34,524;of a traitor's seed
154;00:13:34,558;00:13:36,892;is no fit consort
154;00:13:34,558;00:13:36,892;for our King.
155;00:13:36,927;00:13:39,561;She is a sweet thing now,
155;00:13:36,927;00:13:39,561;Your Grace,
156;00:13:39,595;00:13:42,063;but in 10 years who knows
157;00:13:42,097;00:13:44,065;what treasons
157;00:13:42,097;00:13:44,065;she may hatch?
158;00:13:44,100;00:13:47,168;No, I'm not. I'll be a good wife
158;00:13:44,100;00:13:47,168;to him, you'll see.
159;00:13:47,202;00:13:51,773;I'll be a Queen just like you,
159;00:13:47,202;00:13:51,773;I promise. I won't hatch anything.
160;00:13:53,276;00:13:55,777;The girl is innocent,
160;00:13:53,276;00:13:55,777;Your Grace.
161;00:13:55,812;00:13:59,614;She should be given a chance
161;00:13:55,812;00:13:59,614;to prove her loyalty.
162;00:14:05,922;00:14:08,824;Little dove, you must
162;00:14:05,922;00:14:08,824;write to Lady Catelyn
163;00:14:08,859;00:14:11,193;and your brother,
163;00:14:08,859;00:14:11,193;the eldest, what's his name?
164;00:14:11,228;00:14:12,962;Robb.
165;00:14:12,996;00:14:15,765;Word of your father's arrest
165;00:14:12,996;00:14:15,765;will reach him soon, no doubt.
166;00:14:15,800;00:14:18,201;Best it comes from you.
167;00:14:18,236;00:14:20,604;If you would help
167;00:14:18,236;00:14:20,604;your father,
168;00:14:20,638;00:14:23,074;urge your brother
168;00:14:20,638;00:14:23,074;to keep the King's peace.
169;00:14:23,108;00:14:27,011;Tell him to come to King's Landing
169;00:14:23,108;00:14:27,011;and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
170;00:14:32,283;00:14:36,653;If-- if I could see my father,
170;00:14:32,283;00:14:36,653;talk to him about--
171;00:14:39,256;00:14:42,625;You disappoint me, child.
172;00:14:42,659;00:14:44,960;We have told you
172;00:14:42,659;00:14:44,960;of your father's treason.
173;00:14:44,995;00:14:47,162;Why would you want
173;00:14:44,995;00:14:47,162;to speak to a traitor?
174;00:14:47,197;00:14:49,464;I only meant that--
175;00:14:51,668;00:14:53,502;what will happen to him?
176;00:14:55,104;00:14:58,906;That depends.
176;00:14:55,104;00:14:58,906;On-- on what?
177;00:14:58,940;00:15:00,808;On your brother.
178;00:15:03,845;00:15:06,180;And on you.
179;00:15:13,923;00:15:16,692;Treason?
180;00:15:16,726;00:15:18,861;Sansa wrote this?
181;00:15:18,895;00:15:21,264;It is your sister's hand,
181;00:15:18,895;00:15:21,264;but the Queen's words.
182;00:15:21,298;00:15:25,401;You are summoned to King's Landing
182;00:15:21,298;00:15:25,401;to swear fealty to the new King.
183;00:15:25,436;00:15:28,538;Joffrey puts my father in chains,
183;00:15:25,436;00:15:28,538;now he wants his ass kissed?
184;00:15:28,572;00:15:32,075;This is a royal
184;00:15:28,572;00:15:32,075;command, My Lord.
185;00:15:32,109;00:15:35,578;If you should refuse to obey--
185;00:15:32,109;00:15:35,578;I won't refuse.
186;00:15:35,613;00:15:38,381;His Grace summons me
186;00:15:35,613;00:15:38,381;to King's Landing,
187;00:15:38,415;00:15:40,850;I'll go to King's Landing.
188;00:15:40,884;00:15:43,619;But not alone.
189;00:15:45,722;00:15:47,456;Call the banners.
190;00:15:49,158;00:15:50,825;All of them, My Lord?
191;00:15:50,860;00:15:52,731;They've all sworn to defend
191;00:15:50,860;00:15:52,731;my father, have they not?
192;00:15:52,756;00:15:53,956;They have.
193;00:15:54,864;00:15:57,132;Now we see what
193;00:15:54,864;00:15:57,132;their words are worth.
194;00:15:59,235;00:16:00,402;Yeah.
195;00:16:08,645;00:16:11,046;Are you afraid?
196;00:16:13,884;00:16:15,584;I must be.
197;00:16:15,619;00:16:17,787;Good.
198;00:16:17,821;00:16:19,855;Why is that good?
199;00:16:19,890;00:16:22,191;It means
199;00:16:19,890;00:16:22,191;you're not stupid.
200;00:16:45,582;00:16:47,483;You've had this
200;00:16:45,582;00:16:47,483;since dawn?
201;00:16:48,518;00:16:51,086;He sent it to me,
201;00:16:48,518;00:16:51,086;not you.
202;00:16:51,121;00:16:53,555;I've only shown it
202;00:16:51,121;00:16:53,555;to you as a courtesy.
203;00:16:53,590;00:16:55,457;A courtesy?!
204;00:16:55,491;00:16:57,493;My husband has been
204;00:16:55,491;00:16:57,493;taken prisoner.
205;00:16:57,527;00:16:59,161;My son intends
205;00:16:57,527;00:16:59,161;to declare war.
206;00:16:59,196;00:17:01,063;A war?
207;00:17:01,097;00:17:03,499;Your son against
207;00:17:01,097;00:17:03,499;the Lannisters?
208;00:17:04,834;00:17:07,903;You should go to him.
208;00:17:04,834;00:17:07,903;Teach him patience.
209;00:17:07,937;00:17:11,106;Ned rots in a dungeon
209;00:17:07,937;00:17:11,106;and you speak of patience?
210;00:17:11,141;00:17:13,843;He is your brother by law!
211;00:17:13,877;00:17:16,746;Does family mean
211;00:17:13,877;00:17:16,746;nothing to you?
212;00:17:16,780;00:17:19,649;Family means
212;00:17:16,780;00:17:19,649;everything to me.
213;00:17:19,683;00:17:22,118;And I will not
213;00:17:19,683;00:17:22,118;risk Robin's life
214;00:17:22,152;00:17:24,621;to get caught up in another
214;00:17:22,152;00:17:24,621;of your husband's wars.
215;00:17:24,655;00:17:27,557;I'm hungry.
215;00:17:24,655;00:17:27,557;Hush now, darling.
216;00:17:27,591;00:17:29,792;You just ate.
217;00:17:29,827;00:17:32,662;You will not support us then?
217;00:17:29,827;00:17:32,662;Do I understand you correctly?
218;00:17:32,696;00:17:36,532;But I'm hungry!
218;00:17:32,696;00:17:36,532;Soon, love, soon.
219;00:17:38,569;00:17:40,870;You're always
219;00:17:38,569;00:17:40,870;welcome here, sister.
220;00:17:40,905;00:17:43,906;But if you're asking me to send men
220;00:17:40,905;00:17:43,906;from the Vale to fight--
221;00:17:43,941;00:17:46,142;That is what I ask.
222;00:17:48,111;00:17:50,980;Go on, sweet.
222;00:17:48,111;00:17:50,980;Time for your bath.
223;00:17:51,014;00:17:53,616;I'll feed you after.
224;00:17:58,889;00:18:01,291;If you fear for the safety
224;00:17:58,889;00:18:01,291;of your son--
225;00:18:01,325;00:18:03,993;Of course I fear
225;00:18:01,325;00:18:03,993;for the safety of my son!
226;00:18:04,027;00:18:06,529;Are you an idiot?
227;00:18:06,563;00:18:08,965;They killed my husband.
228;00:18:08,999;00:18:11,434;You say they shoved
228;00:18:08,999;00:18:11,434;your boy from a window.
229;00:18:11,468;00:18:14,003;These people
229;00:18:11,468;00:18:14,003;will do anything.
230;00:18:14,037;00:18:16,104;And that is why
230;00:18:14,037;00:18:16,104;we have to stop them.
231;00:18:19,909;00:18:22,677;The knights of the Vale
231;00:18:19,909;00:18:22,677;will stay in the Vale
232;00:18:22,711;00:18:26,447;where they belong,
232;00:18:22,711;00:18:26,447;to protect their Lord.
233;00:18:39,864;00:18:43,266;Will you shut up?
234;00:18:45,370;00:18:47,404;There's hill tribes
234;00:18:45,370;00:18:47,404;all around here.
235;00:18:47,439;00:18:49,907;If I'm going to die,
236;00:18:49,941;00:18:52,276;it may as well be
236;00:18:49,941;00:18:52,276;with a song in my heart.
237;00:18:52,311;00:18:55,547;I should just take your food
237;00:18:52,311;00:18:55,547;and leave you here.
238;00:18:55,581;00:18:58,850;Eh? What would
238;00:18:55,581;00:18:58,850;you do then?
239;00:18:58,884;00:19:01,720;Starve, most likely.
240;00:19:01,754;00:19:03,588;You don't think
240;00:19:01,754;00:19:03,588;I'd do it, do you?
241;00:19:05,091;00:19:08,126;What do you want, Bronn?
241;00:19:05,091;00:19:08,126;Gold? Women?
242;00:19:08,161;00:19:11,063;Golden women?
243;00:19:11,097;00:19:13,299;Stick with me
243;00:19:11,097;00:19:13,299;and you'll have them all,
244;00:19:13,333;00:19:16,167;for as long as I'm around
244;00:19:13,333;00:19:16,167;and not for a moment longer.
245;00:19:16,202;00:19:19,470;But you knew that.
246;00:19:19,505;00:19:23,073;That is why you so valiantly took
246;00:19:19,505;00:19:23,073;up arms to defend my honor.
247;00:19:24,943;00:19:27,278;Fair enough.
248;00:19:27,313;00:19:29,848;But don't go looking
248;00:19:27,313;00:19:29,848;for me to bend the knee
249;00:19:29,882;00:19:32,451;and My Lord you
249;00:19:29,882;00:19:32,451;every time you take a shit.
250;00:19:32,485;00:19:35,754;I'm not your toady
250;00:19:32,485;00:19:35,754;and I'm not your friend.
251;00:19:36,890;00:19:38,992;Though I would treasure
251;00:19:36,890;00:19:38,992;your friendship,
252;00:19:39,026;00:19:41,628;I'm mainly interested
252;00:19:39,026;00:19:41,628;in your facility with murder.
253;00:19:41,663;00:19:45,066;And if the day ever comes when
253;00:19:41,663;00:19:45,066;you're tempted to sell me out,
254;00:19:45,100;00:19:46,834;remember this:
255;00:19:46,869;00:19:49,737;Whatever their price,
255;00:19:46,869;00:19:49,737;I'll beat it.
256;00:19:49,771;00:19:51,872;I like living.

266;00:20:54,503;00:20:57,538;Tyrion son of Tywin?
267;00:20:59,241;00:21:01,709;In my own bed,
267;00:20:59,241;00:21:01,709;at the age of 80
268;00:21:01,743;00:21:04,611;with a bellyful of wine and
268;00:21:01,743;00:21:04,611;a girl's mouth around my cock.
269;00:21:10,818;00:21:13,020;Take the half man.
270;00:21:13,054;00:21:15,822;He can dance for the children.
270;00:21:13,054;00:21:15,822;Kill the other one.
271;00:21:15,857;00:21:17,958;No no no no no!
272;00:21:17,992;00:21:21,061;My-- my House is rich
272;00:21:17,992;00:21:21,061;and powerful.
273;00:21:21,095;00:21:23,763;If you see us
273;00:21:21,095;00:21:23,763;through these mountains,

275;00:21:25,800;00:21:27,835;for a half man's promises.
276;00:21:27,869;00:21:32,440;Half a man maybe, but at least I have
276;00:21:27,869;00:21:32,440;the courage to face my enemies.
277;00:21:32,474;00:21:34,075;What do the Stone Crows do?
278;00:21:34,109;00:21:36,344;Hide behind rocks
278;00:21:34,109;00:21:36,344;and shiver
279;00:21:36,378;00:21:39,347;when the knights
279;00:21:36,378;00:21:39,347;of the Vale ride by?
280;00:21:39,381;00:21:42,016;Are those the best weapons
280;00:21:39,381;00:21:42,016;you could steal?
281;00:21:43,319;00:21:45,253;Good enough
281;00:21:43,319;00:21:45,253;for killing sheep,
282;00:21:45,287;00:21:47,021;if the sheep
282;00:21:45,287;00:21:47,021;don't fight back.

284;00:21:54,930;00:21:58,332;You think you can win us over
284;00:21:54,930;00:21:58,332;with your trinkets?
285;00:22:09,211;00:22:12,614;That trinket is worth more than
285;00:22:09,211;00:22:12,614;everything your tribe owns.
286;00:22:14,518;00:22:17,888;But if you help us,
286;00:22:14,518;00:22:17,888;Shagga Son of Dolf,
287;00:22:17,922;00:22:20,591;I will not give you trinkets.
288;00:22:20,625;00:22:23,094;I will give you this.
289;00:22:23,996;00:22:25,597;What is this?
290;00:22:26,799;00:22:29,300;The Vale of Arryn.
291;00:22:29,335;00:22:32,637;The Lords of the Vale have always
291;00:22:29,335;00:22:32,637;spat upon the hill tribes.
292;00:22:33,706;00:22:36,875;The Lords of the Vale
292;00:22:33,706;00:22:36,875;want me dead.
293;00:22:38,577;00:22:41,679;I believe it is time
293;00:22:38,577;00:22:41,679;for new Lords of the Vale.
294;00:22:49,120;00:22:51,421;Ser Alliser:
294;00:22:49,120;00:22:51,421;Now there's a rare sight--
295;00:22:51,456;00:22:54,958;not only a bastard,
295;00:22:51,456;00:22:54,958;but a traitor's bastard.
296;00:23:05,903;00:23:08,705;Jon, no!
296;00:23:05,903;00:23:08,705;Jon, stop, put it down!
297;00:23:11,975;00:23:14,043;Blood will always tell.
298;00:23:14,077;00:23:17,214;You'll hang
298;00:23:14,077;00:23:17,214;for this, bastard.
299;00:23:36,500;00:23:39,734;I told you not to do
299;00:23:36,500;00:23:39,734;anything stupid.
300;00:23:39,769;00:23:43,404;You're confined
300;00:23:39,769;00:23:43,404;to quarters. Go.
301;00:24:08,165;00:24:10,099;Ghost, what's wrong?
302;00:24:11,235;00:24:13,337;Is something out there?

312;00:26:49,799;00:26:53,168;I thought the Dothraki
312;00:26:49,799;00:26:53,168;didn't believe in money.

341;00:31:53,164;00:31:55,265;The Great Shepherd sent me
341;00:31:53,164;00:31:55,265;to Earth to heal his--

351;00:32:54,622;00:32:56,857;I will lead the Van
352;00:32:56,891;00:32:59,192;or I will take my men

359;00:33:18,614;00:33:20,615;Oathbreaker, is it?!
360;00:33:22,184;00:33:24,753;I'll not sit here
360;00:33:22,184;00:33:24,753;and swallow insults
361;00:33:24,787;00:33:27,322;from a boy so green
361;00:33:24,787;00:33:27,322;he pisses grass.
362;00:33:41,503;00:33:43,804;My Lord father taught me
362;00:33:41,503;00:33:43,804;it was death to bare steel
363;00:33:43,838;00:33:45,906;against your Liege Lord.
364;00:33:45,940;00:33:50,244;But doubtless the Greatjon only meant
364;00:33:45,940;00:33:50,244;to cut my meat for me.
365;00:33:52,281;00:33:54,716;Your meat...
366;00:33:59,856;00:34:02,525;is bloody tough.
367;00:34:33,159;00:34:36,128;What is it? What's happened?
367;00:34:33,159;00:34:36,128;Shh, it's all right.
368;00:34:40,601;00:34:44,170;Where are you going?
368;00:34:40,601;00:34:44,170;South. For father.
369;00:34:44,205;00:34:45,906;But it's the middle
369;00:34:44,205;00:34:45,906;of the night.
370;00:34:45,940;00:34:48,074;The Lannisters have
370;00:34:45,940;00:34:48,074;spies everywhere.
371;00:34:48,109;00:34:50,676;I don't want them
371;00:34:48,109;00:34:50,676;to know we're coming.
372;00:34:50,711;00:34:53,413;They have
372;00:34:50,711;00:34:53,413;more men than we do.
373;00:34:53,447;00:34:55,648;Aye, they do.
374;00:34:55,683;00:34:57,750;Can't I come with you?
375;00:34:57,785;00:35:00,286;I can ride now.
375;00:34:57,785;00:35:00,286;You've seen me riding.
376;00:35:00,320;00:35:02,422;And I won't get
376;00:35:00,320;00:35:02,422;in the way, I--
377;00:35:02,456;00:35:04,991;There must always be
377;00:35:02,456;00:35:04,991;a Stark at Winterfell.
378;00:35:05,025;00:35:07,160;Until I return
378;00:35:05,025;00:35:07,160;that will be you.
379;00:35:09,630;00:35:12,899;You are not to leave the castle walls
379;00:35:09,630;00:35:12,899;while we are gone. Do you understand?
380;00:35:15,537;00:35:18,906;Listen to Maester Luwin.
380;00:35:15,537;00:35:18,906;Look after your little brother.
381;00:35:18,941;00:35:21,076;I will.
382;00:35:21,110;00:35:23,178;I'll send letters
382;00:35:21,110;00:35:23,178;whenever I can,
383;00:35:23,212;00:35:25,448;but if you don't
383;00:35:23,212;00:35:25,448;hear from me,
384;00:35:25,482;00:35:27,383;don't be scared.
385;00:35:32,490;00:35:34,691;Until I return.
386;00:35:54,914;00:35:57,982;How long have you been
386;00:35:54,914;00:35:57,982;hiding out there?
387;00:35:58,017;00:36:01,486;Robb will be looking for you
387;00:35:58,017;00:36:01,486;to say goodbye.
388;00:36:02,822;00:36:04,756;They've all gone away.
389;00:36:04,791;00:36:07,726;They'll be back soon.
389;00:36:04,791;00:36:07,726;Robb will free father
390;00:36:07,760;00:36:09,962;and they'll come back
390;00:36:07,760;00:36:09,962;with mother.
391;00:36:11,631;00:36:14,133;No, they won't.
392;00:36:18,806;00:36:20,907;Please watch
392;00:36:18,806;00:36:20,907;over Robb.
393;00:36:20,941;00:36:23,409;And watch over all the
393;00:36:20,941;00:36:23,409;other men from Winterfell.
394;00:36:23,443;00:36:26,612;And Theon too,
394;00:36:23,443;00:36:26,612;I suppose.
395;00:36:32,319;00:36:35,087;You hear them, boy?
396;00:36:35,122;00:36:37,723;The Old Gods are
396;00:36:35,122;00:36:37,723;answering you.
397;00:36:37,757;00:36:39,658;What are you
397;00:36:37,757;00:36:39,658;doing here?
398;00:36:39,692;00:36:42,561;They're my Gods too.
399;00:36:44,064;00:36:47,667;Beyond the Wall,
399;00:36:44,064;00:36:47,667;they're the only Gods.
400;00:36:49,036;00:36:51,338;Even slaves
400;00:36:49,036;00:36:51,338;are allowed to pray.
401;00:36:51,372;00:36:53,740;You're not a slave.
402;00:36:55,810;00:36:58,779;Well, your friend did
402;00:36:55,810;00:36:58,779;put a knife to my throat.
403;00:36:59,914;00:37:02,516;I'm not complaining,
403;00:36:59,914;00:37:02,516;Little Lord,
404;00:37:02,550;00:37:05,285;just telling truths.
405;00:37:06,587;00:37:09,389;What did you mean
405;00:37:06,587;00:37:09,389;about hearing the Gods?
406;00:37:09,424;00:37:11,758;You asked them,
407;00:37:11,792;00:37:13,426;they're answering you.
408;00:37:13,461;00:37:16,430;Shh.
409;00:37:16,464;00:37:18,131;Open your ears.
410;00:37:23,571;00:37:25,805;It's only the wind.
411;00:37:25,840;00:37:28,842;Who do you think
411;00:37:25,840;00:37:28,842;sends the wind
412;00:37:28,876;00:37:30,844;if not the Gods?
413;00:37:30,879;00:37:32,580;They see you, boy.
414;00:37:32,614;00:37:35,016;They hear you.
415;00:37:36,652;00:37:39,488;Your brother will get no help
415;00:37:36,652;00:37:39,488;from them where he's going.
416;00:37:39,522;00:37:42,324;The Old Gods have
416;00:37:39,522;00:37:42,324;no power in the South.
417;00:37:42,359;00:37:46,028;The Weirwoods there were
417;00:37:42,359;00:37:46,028;all cut down a long time ago.
418;00:37:46,063;00:37:48,832;How can they watch
418;00:37:46,063;00:37:48,832;when they have no eyes?
419;00:37:51,869;00:37:55,738;Well, there's a big man.
420;00:37:55,772;00:37:58,941;He has giants' blood
420;00:37:55,772;00:37:58,941;in him or I'm the Queen.
421;00:37:58,975;00:38:01,343;Go back and find
421;00:37:58,975;00:38:01,343;your clothes, Hodor.
422;00:38:01,377;00:38:03,211;Go dress.
423;00:38:03,246;00:38:04,779;Hodor.
424;00:38:07,917;00:38:10,118;Are there really giants
424;00:38:07,917;00:38:10,118;beyond the Wall?
425;00:38:11,487;00:38:14,456;Giants
425;00:38:11,487;00:38:14,456;and worse than giants.
426;00:38:14,490;00:38:17,459;I tried telling
426;00:38:14,490;00:38:17,459;your brother,
427;00:38:17,493;00:38:19,294;he's marching
427;00:38:17,493;00:38:19,294;the wrong way.
428;00:38:19,328;00:38:22,831;All these swords,
428;00:38:19,328;00:38:22,831;they should be going North, boy.
429;00:38:22,865;00:38:25,033;North, not south!
430;00:38:27,771;00:38:30,172;The cold winds are rising.
431;00:38:46,157;00:38:48,492;They were touched
431;00:38:46,157;00:38:48,492;by White Walkers.
432;00:38:50,028;00:38:51,996;That's why
432;00:38:50,028;00:38:51,996;they came back.
433;00:38:52,030;00:38:54,899;That's why their eyes
433;00:38:52,030;00:38:54,899;turned blue.
434;00:38:54,933;00:38:58,068;Only fire will
434;00:38:54,933;00:38:58,068;stop them.
435;00:39:00,005;00:39:01,772;How do you know that?
436;00:39:01,807;00:39:03,541;I read about it
436;00:39:01,807;00:39:03,541;in a book--
437;00:39:03,575;00:39:06,644;a very old book
437;00:39:03,575;00:39:06,644;in Maester Aemon's library.
438;00:39:09,181;00:39:11,315;What else
438;00:39:09,181;00:39:11,315;did the book say?
439;00:39:11,350;00:39:13,250;The White Walkers
440;00:39:13,285;00:39:16,053;sleep beneath the ice
440;00:39:13,285;00:39:16,053;for thousands of years.
441;00:39:16,087;00:39:18,623;And when they wake up--
442;00:39:19,624;00:39:23,461;And when they
442;00:39:19,624;00:39:23,461;wake up, what?
443;00:39:26,431;00:39:28,933;I hope The Wall
443;00:39:26,431;00:39:28,933;is high enough.
444;00:40:01,464;00:40:03,765;Summer snows, My Lady.
445;00:40:03,800;00:40:06,835;Robb's brought
445;00:40:03,800;00:40:06,835;the North with him.
446;00:40:13,043;00:40:14,910;The River Lords
446;00:40:13,043;00:40:14,910;are falling back
447;00:40:14,945;00:40:16,779;with Jaime Lannister
447;00:40:14,945;00:40:16,779;at their heels.
448;00:40:16,813;00:40:20,216;And Lord Tywin is bringing around a
448;00:40:16,813;00:40:20,216;second Lannister army from the South.
449;00:40:20,251;00:40:23,020;Our scouts confirm it's even larger
449;00:40:20,251;00:40:23,020;than the Kingslayer's.
450;00:40:23,054;00:40:26,324;One army or two,
450;00:40:23,054;00:40:26,324;the Kings in the North
451;00:40:26,358;00:40:30,161;threw back hosts
451;00:40:26,358;00:40:30,161;10 times as large.
452;00:40:33,665;00:40:35,332;Mother!
453;00:40:38,737;00:40:40,970;You look well.
454;00:40:42,473;00:40:46,242;Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome
454;00:40:42,473;00:40:46,242;sight in these troubled times.
455;00:40:46,276;00:40:48,745;We had not thought
455;00:40:46,276;00:40:48,745;to meet you here, My Lady.
456;00:40:49,714;00:40:52,282;I had not thought
456;00:40:49,714;00:40:52,282;to be here.
457;00:40:52,316;00:40:54,384;I would speak
457;00:40:52,316;00:40:54,384;with my son alone.
458;00:40:54,418;00:40:56,720;I know you will
458;00:40:54,418;00:40:56,720;forgive me, My Lords.
459;00:40:56,755;00:40:58,989;You heard her!
459;00:40:56,755;00:40:58,989;Move your asses!
460;00:40:59,024;00:41:01,359;Come on, out.
461;00:41:01,394;00:41:04,029;You too, Greyjoy.
461;00:41:01,394;00:41:04,029;Are you bloody deaf?
462;00:41:04,063;00:41:05,965;Have no fear, My Lady.
463;00:41:05,999;00:41:08,767;We'll shove our swords
463;00:41:05,999;00:41:08,767;up Tywin Lannister's bunghole
464;00:41:08,801;00:41:11,570;and then it's on to the Red Keep
464;00:41:08,801;00:41:11,570;to free Ned.
465;00:41:11,604;00:41:14,538;You old devil, Rodrik.
465;00:41:11,604;00:41:14,538;Jon.
466;00:41:14,573;00:41:16,907;You're not
466;00:41:14,573;00:41:16,907;wasting away, are you?
467;00:41:28,152;00:41:30,987;I remember the day
467;00:41:28,152;00:41:30,987;you came into this world
468;00:41:31,022;00:41:34,057;red-faced and squalling.
469;00:41:35,559;00:41:38,228;And now I find you
469;00:41:35,559;00:41:38,228;leading a host to war.
470;00:41:39,263;00:41:41,665;There was no one else.
470;00:41:39,263;00:41:41,665;No one?
471;00:41:41,699;00:41:44,434;Who were those men
471;00:41:41,699;00:41:44,434;I saw here?
472;00:41:44,469;00:41:47,538;None of them are Starks.
472;00:41:44,469;00:41:47,538;All of them are seasoned in battle.
473;00:41:47,572;00:41:50,608;If you think you can send me back
473;00:41:47,572;00:41:50,608;to Winterfell--
474;00:41:50,642;00:41:52,910;Oh, would that I could.
475;00:41:55,981;00:41:57,949;There was...
476;00:41:57,983;00:42:00,418;a letter.
477;00:42:02,855;00:42:04,290;From Sansa.
478;00:42:05,258;00:42:07,559;From the Queen,
478;00:42:05,258;00:42:07,559;you mean.
479;00:42:15,533;00:42:18,635;There's no mention of Arya.
479;00:42:15,533;00:42:18,635;No.
480;00:42:29,246;00:42:31,580;How many men
480;00:42:29,246;00:42:31,580;do you have?
481;00:42:31,614;00:42:34,016;18,000.
482;00:42:34,050;00:42:36,518;If I go to King's Landing
482;00:42:34,050;00:42:36,518;and bend my knee to Joffrey--
483;00:42:36,552;00:42:39,621;you would never
483;00:42:36,552;00:42:39,621;be allowed to leave. No.
484;00:42:39,655;00:42:42,424;Our best hope--
484;00:42:39,655;00:42:42,424;our only hope--
485;00:42:42,458;00:42:45,761;is that you can defeat
485;00:42:42,458;00:42:45,761;them in the field.
486;00:42:45,795;00:42:47,829;And if I lose?
487;00:42:47,863;00:42:50,398;Do you know what happened
487;00:42:47,863;00:42:50,398;to the Targaryen children
488;00:42:50,433;00:42:53,436;when the Mad King fell?
488;00:42:50,433;00:42:53,436;They were butchered in their sleep.
489;00:42:53,470;00:42:56,172;On the orders
489;00:42:53,470;00:42:56,172;of Tywin Lannister.
490;00:42:56,206;00:42:58,909;And the years have
490;00:42:56,206;00:42:58,909;not made him kinder.
491;00:43:02,013;00:43:04,182;If you lose,
492;00:43:04,216;00:43:06,918;your father dies,
493;00:43:06,952;00:43:08,486;your sisters die,
494;00:43:08,520;00:43:10,754;we die.
495;00:43:13,324;00:43:15,358;Well, that makes it
495;00:43:13,324;00:43:15,358;simple then.
496;00:43:16,694;00:43:18,694;I suppose it does.
497;00:43:41,716;00:43:44,951;From here it might be best if
497;00:43:41,716;00:43:44,951;Bronn and I continue alone.
498;00:43:44,986;00:43:47,555;Best for Tyrion
498;00:43:44,986;00:43:47,555;son of Tywin.
499;00:43:47,589;00:43:49,590;Not best for me.
500;00:43:49,624;00:43:52,794;If the half man betrays us,
501;00:43:52,828;00:43:56,264;Shagga Son of Dolf
501;00:43:52,828;00:43:56,264;will cut off his manhood--
502;00:43:56,299;00:43:58,834;and feed it
502;00:43:56,299;00:43:58,834;to the goats, yes.
503;00:44:01,338;00:44:03,906;All right then.
504;00:44:03,940;00:44:06,142;Time to meet my father.
505;00:44:38,475;00:44:41,277;Tyrion.
505;00:44:38,475;00:44:41,277;Uncle.
506;00:44:41,311;00:44:43,179;Father.
507;00:44:44,682;00:44:47,683;The rumors of your demise
507;00:44:44,682;00:44:47,683;were unfounded.
508;00:44:47,718;00:44:51,119;Sorry
508;00:44:47,718;00:44:51,119;to disappoint you.
509;00:44:51,154;00:44:53,689;And who are these...

523;00:45:40,438;00:45:42,505;The honor of the House
523;00:45:40,438;00:45:42,505;was at stake.

524;00:45:44,008;00:45:47,177;submitted to capture so meekly.
525;00:45:47,212;00:45:49,746;We have our differences,

526;00:45:49,781;00:45:51,949;He's braver.
526;00:45:49,781;00:45:51,949;I'm better looking.
527;00:45:51,983;00:45:54,318;He's been covering himself
527;00:45:51,983;00:45:54,318;in glory.
528;00:45:54,353;00:45:57,589;Jaime smashed the River Lords

531;00:46:03,461;00:46:07,531;--Is our hostage. He will lead
531;00:46:03,461;00:46:07,531;no armies from his dungeon cell.
532;00:46:07,566;00:46:09,600;How did my sweet sister
532;00:46:07,566;00:46:09,600;persuade the King
533;00:46:09,634;00:46:11,502;to imprison
533;00:46:09,634;00:46:11,502;his dear friend Ned?

536;00:46:21,682;00:46:23,983;Stark's son has
536;00:46:21,682;00:46:23,983;called his banners.

537;00:46:24,018;00:46:27,454;A green boy.
538;00:46:27,488;00:46:29,255;One taste of battle
538;00:46:27,488;00:46:29,255;and he'll run
539;00:46:29,290;00:46:31,859;back to Winterfell
539;00:46:29,290;00:46:31,859;wi his tail between his legs.
540;00:46:33,061;00:46:34,561;Maybe.
541;00:46:34,595;00:46:37,164;Though the boy does have
541;00:46:34,595;00:46:37,164;a certain belligerence.
542;00:46:37,198;00:46:39,700;You'd like him.
543;00:46:39,734;00:46:43,771;While we're on
543;00:46:39,734;00:46:43,771;the subject of war,
544;00:46:43,805;00:46:46,507;I made promises

545;00:46:46,541;00:46:48,909;and a Lannister
545;00:46:46,541;00:46:48,909;always pays his debts.
546;00:46:48,943;00:46:52,012;We shall require

549;00:46:56,150;00:46:58,718;if it please My Lord,
550;00:46:58,752;00:47:00,820;Ser Addam bids me report

551;00:47:00,854;00:47:02,254;have crossed the neck.
552;00:47:04,257;00:47:06,725;The wolf rushes
552;00:47:04,257;00:47:06,725;into the lion's jaws.
553;00:47:06,759;00:47:10,996;So be it. Kevan, command the

554;00:47:12,499;00:47:15,635;And send word to Jaime that
554;00:47:12,499;00:47:15,635;I am moving against Robb Stark.
555;00:47:15,669;00:47:17,637;At once, My Lord.
556;00:47:30,586;00:47:33,554;It is said that the men of the
556;00:47:30,586;00:47:33,554;Mountain clans are great warriors.
557;00:47:33,589;00:47:35,323;Ride with me
557;00:47:33,589;00:47:35,323;against my enemies
558;00:47:35,357;00:47:38,393;and you shall have all
558;00:47:35,357;00:47:38,393;my son promised you and more.
559;00:47:38,428;00:47:40,662;Only if the half man
559;00:47:38,428;00:47:40,662;fights with us.
560;00:47:40,697;00:47:44,133;Until we hold the steel
560;00:47:40,697;00:47:44,133;he pledged us,

561;00:47:44,168;00:47:46,569;life is ours.
562;00:47:52,142;00:47:54,811;The scouts report
562;00:47:52,142;00:47:54,811;Lord Tywin moves north.
563;00:47:54,845;00:47:56,679;We need to get him
563;00:47:54,845;00:47:56,679;on broken ground,
564;00:47:56,714;00:47:58,381;put his Knights
564;00:47:56,714;00:47:58,381;at a disadvantage.
565;00:47:58,415;00:48:00,517;No, we need to get

566;00:48:00,551;00:48:03,453;and break Jaime Lannister's
566;00:48:00,551;00:48:03,453;siege of Riverrun.
567;00:48:03,488;00:48:06,323;Do that and the River Lords
567;00:48:03,488;00:48:06,323;will join us.
568;00:48:06,357;00:48:08,225;To do either we need to cross
568;00:48:06,357;00:48:08,225;the river
569;00:48:08,259;00:48:09,926;and the only crossing
569;00:48:08,259;00:48:09,926;is at The Twins.
570;00:48:09,960;00:48:11,995;Lord Frey controls
570;00:48:09,960;00:48:11,995;that bridge.

573;00:48:16,900;00:48:20,403;At the Trident, he didn't appear
573;00:48:16,900;00:48:20,403;until the battle was done.
574;00:48:20,437;00:48:24,474;Some men takes their oaths
574;00:48:20,437;00:48:24,474;more seriously than others.
575;00:48:31,882;00:48:34,617;Robb's right.
575;00:48:31,882;00:48:34,617;We need that bridge.
576;00:48:34,651;00:48:36,752;So what's it going to be?
577;00:48:36,787;00:48:40,189;Do we move against
577;00:48:36,787;00:48:40,189;Jaime or Lord Tywin?
578;00:48:44,361;00:48:45,895;Your pardon, my lords.
579;00:48:45,929;00:48:48,598;We've captured
579;00:48:45,929;00:48:48,598;a Lannister scout.
580;00:48:50,501;00:48:53,837;Don't worry, lad. He won't b
580;00:48:50,501;00:48:53,837;leaving this tent with his head.
581;00:48:55,173;00:48:56,840;Where did you find him?
582;00:48:56,875;00:48:59,009;In the brush above

583;00:48:59,043;00:49:00,911;He looked to be counting.
584;00:49:11,356;00:49:13,157;How high did you get?
585;00:49:15,527;00:49:17,528;20,000.
585;00:49:15,527;00:49:17,528;Maybe more.
586;00:49:18,563;00:49:20,297;You don't have
586;00:49:18,563;00:49:20,297;to do this yourself.
587;00:49:20,331;00:49:21,898;Your father
587;00:49:20,331;00:49:21,898;would understand--
588;00:49:21,933;00:49:25,969;My father unrstands mercy,
588;00:49:21,933;00:49:25,969;when there is room for it.
589;00:49:27,371;00:49:29,205;And he understands honor...
590;00:49:32,010;00:49:34,277;and courage.
591;00:49:36,180;00:49:38,014;Let him go.
592;00:49:38,983;00:49:41,384;Robb.
593;00:49:53,396;00:49:56,364;Tell Lord Tywin

630;00:52:45,068;00:52:48,771;Yours or your King's?
631;00:52:48,805;00:52:51,674;You let my father die.
632;00:52:51,708;00:52:54,644;You're too old
632;00:52:51,708;00:52:54,644;to protect anybody.
633;00:52:56,948;00:52:59,683;Your Grace--
633;00:52:56,948;00:52:59,683;The Council has determined
634;00:52:59,717;00:53:02,152;that Ser Jaime Lannister
634;00:52:59,717;00:53:02,152;will take your place
635;00:53:02,187;00:53:04,455;as Lord Commander
635;00:53:02,187;00:53:04,455;of the Kingsguard.
636;00:53:04,489;00:53:06,023;The man who
636;00:53:04,489;00:53:06,023;profaned his blade
637;00:53:06,058;00:53:08,259;with the blood of the King
637;00:53:06,058;00:53:08,259;he had sworn to defend!
638;00:53:08,293;00:53:10,227;Careful, Ser.
639;00:53:10,261;00:53:11,962;We have nothing
639;00:53:10,261;00:53:11,962;but gratitude
640;00:53:11,996;00:53:14,465;for your long service,
640;00:53:11,996;00:53:14,465;good Ser.
641;00:53:14,499;00:53:16,967;You shall be given
641;00:53:14,499;00:53:16,967;a stout Keep beside the sea,
642;00:53:17,001;00:53:19,336;with servants
642;00:53:17,001;00:53:19,336;to look after your every need.
643;00:53:19,370;00:53:21,571;A hall to die in
644;00:53:21,606;00:53:24,007;and men to bury me.
645;00:53:25,609;00:53:28,645;I am a Knight.
646;00:53:28,679;00:53:31,715;I shall die a Knight.
647;00:53:37,655;00:53:39,790;A naked Knight,
647;00:53:37,655;00:53:39,790;apparently.
648;00:53:50,935;00:53:54,371;Even now I could cut through
648;00:53:50,935;00:53:54,371;the five of you like carving a cake!
649;00:53:58,543;00:54:01,077;Here, boy!
650;00:54:01,112;00:54:03,547;Melt it down and add it
650;00:54:01,112;00:54:03,547;to the others.
651;00:54:20,063;00:54:22,398;If any man in this hall
651;00:54:20,063;00:54:22,398;has other matters
652;00:54:22,432;00:54:25,567;to set before His Grace,
652;00:54:22,432;00:54:25,567;let him speak now
653;00:54:25,602;00:54:28,838;or go forth and hold
653;00:54:25,602;00:54:28,838;his silence.
654;00:54:31,509;00:54:33,644;Your Grace.
655;00:54:33,678;00:54:36,047;Come forward,
655;00:54:33,678;00:54:36,047;My Lady.
656;00:54:37,816;00:54:40,552;The Lady Sansa
656;00:54:37,816;00:54:40,552;of House Stark.
657;00:54:42,088;00:54:45,490;Do you have some business for
657;00:54:42,088;00:54:45,490;the King and the Council, Sansa?
658;00:54:45,525;00:54:47,359;I do.
659;00:54:52,231;00:54:55,333;As it please Your Grace,
659;00:54:52,231;00:54:55,333;I ask mercy for my father,
660;00:54:55,367;00:54:58,837;Lord Eddard Stark,
660;00:54:55,367;00:54:58,837;who was Hand of the King.
661;00:54:58,871;00:55:01,739;Treason is a noxious weed.
662;00:55:01,774;00:55:05,944;It should be torn out, root--
662;00:55:01,774;00:55:05,944;Let her speak.
663;00:55:05,979;00:55:08,681;I want to hear
663;00:55:05,979;00:55:08,681;what she says.
664;00:55:08,715;00:55:10,850;Thank you, Your Grace.
665;00:55:10,884;00:55:13,487;Do you deny
665;00:55:10,884;00:55:13,487;your father's crime?
666;00:55:13,521;00:55:17,992;No, My Lords.
666;00:55:13,521;00:55:17,992;I know he must be punished.
667;00:55:18,026;00:55:20,027;All I ask is mercy.
668;00:55:20,062;00:55:22,931;I know My Lord father
668;00:55:20,062;00:55:22,931;must regret what he did.
669;00:55:22,965;00:55:25,267;He was King Robert's friend
669;00:55:22,965;00:55:25,267;and he loved him.
670;00:55:25,301;00:55:27,502;You all know he loved him.
671;00:55:27,537;00:55:31,139;He never wanted to be Hand
671;00:55:27,537;00:55:31,139;until the King asked him.
672;00:55:31,173;00:55:34,575;They must have lied to him--
672;00:55:31,173;00:55:34,575;Lord Renly or Lord Stannis
673;00:55:34,609;00:55:37,411;or somebody.
673;00:55:34,609;00:55:37,411;They must have lied!
674;00:55:37,446;00:55:39,914;He said
674;00:55:37,446;00:55:39,914;I wasn't the King.
675;00:55:39,948;00:55:42,015;Why did he say that?
676;00:55:42,050;00:55:44,318;He was badly hurt.
677;00:55:44,352;00:55:47,220;Maester Pycelle was giving
677;00:55:44,352;00:55:47,220;him milk of the poppy.
678;00:55:47,254;00:55:51,424;He wasn't himself. Otherwise h
678;00:55:47,254;00:55:51,424;never would have said it.
679;00:55:53,760;00:55:57,630;A child's faith...
679;00:55:53,760;00:55:57,630;Such sweet innocence.
680;00:55:57,664;00:56:01,334;And yet they say
680;00:55:57,664;00:56:01,334;wisdom oft comes
681;00:56:01,369;00:56:03,203;from the mouths of babes.
682;00:56:03,237;00:56:07,374;Treason
682;00:56:03,237;00:56:07,374;is treason!
683;00:56:10,512;00:56:12,679;Anything else?
684;00:56:14,249;00:56:17,651;If you still have any affection
684;00:56:14,249;00:56:17,651;in your heart for me,
685;00:56:17,685;00:56:21,187;please do me
685;00:56:17,685;00:56:21,187;this kindness, Your Grace.
686;00:56:30,764;00:56:33,031;Your sweet words
686;00:56:30,764;00:56:33,031;have moved me.
687;00:56:35,435;00:56:38,002;But your father has
687;00:56:35,435;00:56:38,002;to confess.
688;00:56:38,037;00:56:41,639;He has to confess
688;00:56:38,037;00:56:41,639;and say that I'm the King...
689;00:56:44,542;00:56:46,677;Or there'll be
689;00:56:44,542;00:56:46,677;no mercy for him.
690;00:56:51,149;00:56:53,250;He will.
