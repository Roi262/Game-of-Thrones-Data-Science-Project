138;00:09:56,405;00:09:59,407;Greyjoy without my consent?
139;00:09:59,409;00:10:01,493;You made me acting
139;00:09:59,409;00:10:01,493;Lord of the Dreadfort.
140;00:10:01,544;00:10:02,994;I acted.
141;00:10:09,001;00:10:11,636;I had to smuggle myself
141;00:10:09,001;00:10:11,636;into my own lands
142;00:10:11,671;00:10:13,471;thanks to the Greyjoys.
143;00:10:13,506;00:10:15,473;I needed Theon.
144;00:10:15,508;00:10:17,425;I needed him whole.
145;00:10:17,476;00:10:20,929;Theon was our enemy.
146;00:10:20,980;00:10:22,981;But Reek,
147;00:10:23,015;00:10:25,850;Reek will never betray us.
148;00:10:27,019;00:10:29,604;I placed far too much
148;00:10:27,019;00:10:29,604;trust in you.
149;00:10:38,414;00:10:42,284;Reek, how could you let me stand
149;00:10:38,414;00:10:42,284;before my father unshaven?
150;00:10:42,286;00:10:45,787;—  It's disrespectful.
150;00:10:42,286;00:10:45,787;— I'm sorry, my lord.
151;00:10:48,007;00:10:50,125;Give him the razor.
152;00:10:57,967;00:11:01,219;If I'm not a Bolton,
152;00:10:57,967;00:11:01,219;Father, what does it matter?
153;00:11:09,362;00:11:10,895;Go on, Reek.
154;00:11:10,946;00:11:13,365;A nice close shave.
155;00:11:33,636;00:11:37,088;Reek, tell Father
156;00:11:37,139;00:11:40,175;where are Bran and Rickon Stark?
157;00:11:40,177;00:11:42,227;I don't know, my lord.
158;00:11:42,261;00:11:44,012;You murdered them
159;00:11:44,046;00:11:47,816;and displayed their corpses
159;00:11:44,046;00:11:47,816;at Winterfell.
160;00:11:47,850;00:11:51,269;Ramsay: — Reek,
161;00:11:51,303;00:11:53,521;did you murder the Stark boys?
162;00:11:53,572;00:11:55,740;No, my lord.
163;00:11:55,775;00:11:57,025;Just two farm boys.
164;00:11:57,076;00:12:00,028;Ramsay: — And crisped them
164;00:11:57,076;00:12:00,028;so no one would know.
165;00:12:00,079;00:12:02,697;Theon:
165;00:12:00,079;00:12:02,697;Yes, my lord.
166;00:12:04,500;00:12:07,202;The Starks have always
166;00:12:04,500;00:12:07,202;ruled the North.
167;00:12:07,253;00:12:09,921;If Bran and Rickon are alive,
168;00:12:09,955;00:12:12,540;the country will rally
168;00:12:09,955;00:12:12,540;to their side
169;00:12:12,542;00:12:14,759;now that Robb Stark is gone.
170;00:12:16,929;00:12:19,798;Oh, that's right, Reek.
171;00:12:21,233;00:12:23,268;Robb Stark is dead.
172;00:12:23,302;00:12:26,054;Sorry.
173;00:12:26,056;00:12:28,356;I know he was like
173;00:12:26,056;00:12:28,356;a brother to you.
174;00:12:28,391;00:12:31,309;But my father put a knife
174;00:12:28,391;00:12:31,309;through his heart.
175;00:12:34,613;00:12:36,731;How do you feel about that?
176;00:12:50,212;00:12:52,630;— You ready for a hunt?
176;00:12:50,212;00:12:52,630;— Always.
177;00:12:52,665;00:12:55,917;Find those boys and I'll give
177;00:12:52,665;00:12:55,917;you 1,000 acres and a holdfast.
178;00:12:55,919;00:12:57,969;Your pet rat have any thoughts
179;00:12:58,003;00:13:00,221;on which way they went
179;00:12:58,003;00:13:00,221;after Winterfell?
180;00:13:02,224;00:13:04,392;Jon Snow is at Castle Black.
181;00:13:05,811;00:13:07,762;Who the fuck is Jon Snow?
182;00:13:07,764;00:13:09,147;Their bastard brother.
183;00:13:09,181;00:13:11,433;He could be sheltering them.
184;00:13:11,484;00:13:13,067;He may know where they are.
185;00:13:14,687;00:13:18,156;Even if he doesn't,
185;00:13:14,687;00:13:18,156;he's half Stark himself.
186;00:13:18,190;00:13:19,824;Could be a threat.
187;00:13:19,859;00:13:22,010;You want to prove
187;00:13:19,859;00:13:22,010;yourself a Bolton?
188;00:13:22,044;00:13:25,613;Gather whatever men you can
188;00:13:22,044;00:13:25,613;and ride for Moat Cailin.
189;00:13:25,615;00:13:27,866;Bring this creature of yours.
190;00:13:29,084;00:13:31,202;Maybe he'll be of some use.
191;00:13:33,589;00:13:35,623;Take the Moat for the family,
192;00:13:35,674;00:13:37,342;for our family,
193;00:13:37,376;00:13:39,878;and I'll reconsider
193;00:13:37,376;00:13:39,878;your position.
194;00:13:42,965;00:13:46,434;Lord Varys.
194;00:13:42,965;00:13:46,434;Breakfasting with the king?
195;00:13:46,469;00:13:49,771;I'm afraid foreigners aren't
195;00:13:46,469;00:13:49,771;welcome at such exclusive affairs.
196;00:13:49,805;00:13:52,607;— Oh, to be foreign.
196;00:13:49,805;00:13:52,607;— Ahem.
197;00:13:52,641;00:13:54,776;Shae has been noticed.
198;00:13:54,810;00:13:56,311;Sansa's maid saw you with her.
199;00:13:56,313;00:13:58,029;She already told your sister.
200;00:13:58,113;00:14:00,315;It's only a matter of time
200;00:13:58,113;00:14:00,315;before your father hears.
201;00:14:00,317;00:14:03,485;So I'm guilty of being seen
201;00:14:00,317;00:14:03,485;with my own wife's handmaiden.
202;00:14:03,536;00:14:05,320;My father will ask you
202;00:14:03,536;00:14:05,320;if there's anything more
203;00:14:05,322;00:14:06,988;and you'll tell him
203;00:14:05,322;00:14:06,988;some clever lie.
204;00:14:07,039;00:14:08,740;No, I will not.
205;00:14:08,791;00:14:12,043;How long do you imagine your father
205;00:14:08,791;00:14:12,043;and sister would let me live
206;00:14:12,077;00:14:14,412;if they suspected me of lying?
207;00:14:14,463;00:14:16,831;I have no pet sellsword
207;00:14:14,463;00:14:16,831;to protect me.
208;00:14:16,882;00:14:18,917;No legendary brother
208;00:14:16,882;00:14:18,917;to avenge me.
209;00:14:18,968;00:14:21,386;Only little birds
209;00:14:18,968;00:14:21,386;who whisper in my ear.
210;00:14:21,420;00:14:23,204;Forgive me
210;00:14:21,420;00:14:23,204;if I don't weep for you.
211;00:14:23,239;00:14:26,257;No one weeps
211;00:14:23,239;00:14:26,257;for spiders or whores.
212;00:14:26,308;00:14:29,427;I have friends across
212;00:14:26,308;00:14:29,427;the sea who could help her.
213;00:14:29,478;00:14:30,979;She won't leave.
214;00:14:31,013;00:14:32,263;I've told her this is
214;00:14:31,013;00:14:32,263;a dangerous place
215;00:14:32,314;00:14:34,182;so many times,
215;00:14:32,314;00:14:34,182;she no longer believes it.
216;00:14:34,233;00:14:37,185;Your father has promised to hang
216;00:14:34,233;00:14:37,185;the next whore he finds you with.
217;00:14:37,236;00:14:40,772;Have you ever known your
217;00:14:37,236;00:14:40,772;father to make an idle threat?
218;00:14:43,826;00:14:45,994;From House Tyrell and the
218;00:14:43,826;00:14:45,994;people of the Reach,
219;00:14:46,028;00:14:50,198;Your Grace, it is my honor to
219;00:14:46,028;00:14:50,198;present you with this wedding cup.
220;00:14:50,249;00:14:52,784;May you and my daughter Margaery
221;00:14:52,835;00:14:54,619;drink deep and live long.
222;00:14:54,670;00:14:57,038;A handsome goblet, my lord.
223;00:14:57,089;00:14:59,707;Or shall I call you Father?
224;00:14:59,758;00:15:02,293;I shall be honored, Your Grace.
225;00:15:09,635;00:15:12,036;She's the whore
225;00:15:09,635;00:15:12,036;I told you about.
226;00:15:12,071;00:15:13,888;The dark-haired one.
227;00:15:15,558;00:15:18,560;Have her brought to the Tower
227;00:15:15,558;00:15:18,560;of the Hand before the wedding.
228;00:15:29,071;00:15:30,405;A book?

547;00:37:33,395;00:37:35,111;You should see Qyburn.
547;00:37:33,395;00:37:35,111;He's quite good.
548;00:37:35,146;00:37:38,231;— Your Grace.
548;00:37:35,146;00:37:38,231;— Qyburn? Deplorable man.
549;00:37:38,282;00:37:41,701;Brought shame on the Citadel
549;00:37:38,282;00:37:41,701;with his repugnant experiments.
550;00:37:41,736;00:37:44,070;More repugnant than your gnarled

553;00:37:49,327;00:37:51,411;to you if you annoyed me?
554;00:37:51,413;00:37:53,413;I never meant to annoy anyone.
555;00:37:53,415;00:37:56,333;But you are.
555;00:37:53,415;00:37:56,333;You annoy me right now.

556;00:37:56,384;00:37:58,551;in my presence annoys me.
557;00:37:58,586;00:38:00,086;So here's what I want you to do.
558;00:38:00,088;00:38:01,638;I want you to leave my presence.
559;00:38:01,672;00:38:03,089;Leave this wedding right now.

561;00:38:04,809;00:38:08,261;will be brought to the kennels.
