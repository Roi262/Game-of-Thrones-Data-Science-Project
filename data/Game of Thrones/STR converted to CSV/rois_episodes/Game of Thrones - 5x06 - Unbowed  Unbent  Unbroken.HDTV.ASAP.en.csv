1;00:00:01,199;00:00:03,738;My son, Jorah, fled Westeros.
2;00:00:03,858;00:00:05,919;He brought dishonor to our house.
3;00:00:06,039;00:00:10,561;I need to turn this bunch of thieves and
3;00:00:06,039;00:00:10,561;runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
4;00:00:10,681;00:00:12,368;And how's this going, Commander Mormont?
5;00:00:13,512;00:00:15,381;I shall have your head!
6;00:00:18,407;00:00:20,077;You're taking us through Valyria.
7;00:00:20,426;00:00:22,594;The Doom still rules Valyria.
8;00:00:26,399;00:00:27,545;Stone Men!
9;00:00:30,898;00:00:32,381;Had any touch you?
10;00:00:33,316;00:00:34,375;You?
11;00:00:37,789;00:00:39,422;The Eyrie is mine.
12;00:00:40,269;00:00:43,933;The last time the Lords of the Eyrie formed
12;00:00:40,269;00:00:43,933;an alliance with the Lords of the North,
13;00:00:44,053;00:00:46,861;they brought down the greatest
13;00:00:44,053;00:00:46,861;dynasty this world has ever known.
14;00:00:49,316;00:00:50,612;Cersei sent for me.
15;00:00:50,899;00:00:53,561;I expect I'll be a married
15;00:00:50,899;00:00:53,561;woman by the time you return.
16;00:00:53,681;00:00:55,492;I hope I can make her happy.
17;00:00:55,612;00:00:56,664;She suffered enough.
18;00:00:56,784;00:00:58,446;I'll never hurt her!
19;00:00:58,873;00:01:01,209;All sinners are equal before the Gods.
20;00:01:01,329;00:01:05,290;What would you say if I told you
20;00:01:01,329;00:01:05,290;of a great sinner in our very midst?
21;00:01:05,640;00:01:07,996;May the Father judge him justly.
22;00:01:08,116;00:01:10,313;Who do you think you are?
22;00:01:08,116;00:01:10,313;Justice.
23;00:01:11,481;00:01:15,122;Your brother was murdered,
23;00:01:11,481;00:01:15,122;while you sit here, doing nothing.
24;00:01:15,242;00:01:16,475;The Sand Snakes are with me.
25;00:01:16,685;00:01:19,646;Without Doran we have no army
25;00:01:16,685;00:01:19,646;to march against the Lannisters.
26;00:01:19,766;00:01:22,337;Queen Cersei loves her children.
27;00:01:22,457;00:01:23,692;And we have one of them.
28;00:01:23,812;00:01:26,347;We rescue my niece,
28;00:01:23,812;00:01:26,347;bring her back to the family.
29;00:01:26,467;00:01:27,842;You ever been to Dorne?
30;00:01:31,175;00:01:32,592;The Dornish are crazy.
31;00:01:32,712;00:01:36,261;If he gets to her before we do, we
31;00:01:32,712;00:01:36,261;lose our only chance for revenge.
32;00:01:38,309;00:01:40,443;Here we serve the Many-Faced God.
33;00:01:40,563;00:01:42,966;To serve well, a girl must become no one.
34;00:01:43,214;00:01:45,239;What do we with them after you wash them?
35;00:03:27,348;00:03:37,775;
36;00:05:40,540;00:05:42,241;What are they doing
36;00:05:40,540;00:05:42,241;with the bodies?
37;00:05:42,292;00:05:43,437;Get back to work.
38;00:05:43,897;00:05:46,515;No. I've been here
38;00:05:43,897;00:05:46,515;for weeks.
39;00:05:46,517;00:05:48,017;I'm not scrubbing
39;00:05:46,517;00:05:48,017;one more corpse
40;00:05:48,068;00:05:50,586;until you tell me
40;00:05:48,068;00:05:50,586;why I'm doing it.
41;00:05:50,620;00:05:52,521;You will know why.
42;00:05:52,589;00:05:56,826;When?
42;00:05:52,589;00:05:56,826;When it's time, not before.
43;00:05:56,860;00:05:58,327;Get back to work.
44;00:05:58,361;00:05:59,829;When do I get to play the game?
45;00:05:59,863;00:06:01,497;Game?
46;00:06:01,531;00:06:04,116;The game.
46;00:06:01,531;00:06:04,116;The Game of Faces.
47;00:06:04,151;00:06:07,536;You tried already.
47;00:06:04,151;00:06:07,536;You failed.
48;00:06:07,587;00:06:09,004;I didn't even know
48;00:06:07,587;00:06:09,004;I was playing.
49;00:06:09,039;00:06:11,423;Who are you?
50;00:06:11,458;00:06:13,108;No one.
51;00:06:14,377;00:06:15,628;Get back to work.
52;00:06:15,679;00:06:17,129;Who are you?
53;00:06:17,214;00:06:20,382;What are you doing here?
53;00:06:17,214;00:06:20,382;How did you get here?
54;00:06:21,601;00:06:24,954;I'm from Westeros just like you.
55;00:06:26,156;00:06:28,707;Daughter of a lord
55;00:06:26,156;00:06:28,707;just like you.
56;00:06:29,810;00:06:31,544;Except I was an only child.
57;00:06:31,578;00:06:34,797;Heir to his fortune.
58;00:06:34,831;00:06:37,399;My mother died.
59;00:06:37,401;00:06:39,652;My father remarried
59;00:06:37,401;00:06:39,652;and his new wife
60;00:06:39,736;00:06:42,555;gave birth to a girl.
61;00:06:42,589;00:06:47,142;My stepmother didn't want any
61;00:06:42,589;00:06:47,142;rivals for her precious daughter,
62;00:06:47,210;00:06:49,211;so she tried
62;00:06:47,210;00:06:49,211;to kill me with poison.
63;00:06:49,246;00:06:51,480;I found out.
64;00:06:51,515;00:06:53,749;Sought help from
64;00:06:51,515;00:06:53,749;the Faceless Men.
65;00:06:55,952;00:06:58,637;And my father was widowed again.
66;00:07:00,307;00:07:02,675;I've been serving them
66;00:07:00,307;00:07:02,675;ever since.
67;00:07:13,887;00:07:17,172;Was that true or a lie?
68;00:07:19,876;00:07:21,327;What?
69;00:07:21,361;00:07:23,162;Did you believe
69;00:07:21,361;00:07:23,162;every word I said?
70;00:07:28,001;00:07:29,585;Get back to work.
71;00:07:44,184;00:07:46,235;Who are you?
72;00:07:55,779;00:07:57,813;Who are you?
73;00:08:02,786;00:08:04,236;Arya.
74;00:08:05,405;00:08:07,539;And where did you come from?
75;00:08:07,624;00:08:09,041;Westeros.
76;00:08:13,179;00:08:15,164;My family home is Winterfell.
77;00:08:15,166;00:08:17,800;I'm the youngest daughter
77;00:08:15,166;00:08:17,800;of a great lord,
78;00:08:17,834;00:08:19,034;Eddard Stark.
79;00:08:19,085;00:08:20,669;He died in battle.
80;00:08:21,805;00:08:23,339;A lie.
81;00:08:23,390;00:08:26,442;After he was executed,
81;00:08:23,390;00:08:26,442;I fled the capital.
82;00:08:27,811;00:08:29,678;Had to kill a stable boy.
83;00:08:29,729;00:08:31,513;Drove my sword through his back.
84;00:08:33,016;00:08:34,650;A lie.
85;00:08:34,684;00:08:36,602;I stabbed him in the gut.
86;00:08:36,636;00:08:39,171;I tried to find
86;00:08:36,636;00:08:39,171;my mother and brother,
87;00:08:39,205;00:08:40,839;but I never did.
88;00:08:40,907;00:08:43,275;They were murdered
88;00:08:40,907;00:08:43,275;by Walder Frey.
89;00:08:44,694;00:08:46,912;An outlaw kidnapped me,
89;00:08:44,694;00:08:46,912;a man called Polliver.
90;00:08:48,866;00:08:52,368;A man called the Hound.
90;00:08:48,866;00:08:52,368;Sandor Clegane.
91;00:08:52,370;00:08:54,503;He tried to sell me,
91;00:08:52,370;00:08:54,503;but was wounded in a fight.
92;00:08:54,537;00:08:56,538;He begged me to kill him,
92;00:08:54,537;00:08:56,538;but I wouldn't.
93;00:08:56,573;00:08:58,674;I left him
93;00:08:56,573;00:08:58,674;in the mountains to die.
94;00:08:58,708;00:09:01,176;I wanted him to suffer.
94;00:08:58,708;00:09:01,176;I hated him.
95;00:09:03,296;00:09:04,763;I hated him.
96;00:09:06,433;00:09:09,218;That's not a lie!
97;00:09:09,220;00:09:12,221;A girl lies to me,
98;00:09:12,272;00:09:15,724;to the Many-Faced God,
98;00:09:12,272;00:09:15,724;to herself.
99;00:09:15,726;00:09:17,910;Does she truly
99;00:09:15,726;00:09:17,910;want to be no one?
100;00:09:17,978;00:09:20,145;Yes.
101;00:09:25,201;00:09:28,153;I'm not playing
101;00:09:25,201;00:09:28,153;this stupid game anymore!
102;00:09:28,204;00:09:30,372;We never stop playing.
103;00:09:52,645;00:09:56,265;So, those villages
103;00:09:52,645;00:09:56,265;we were supposed to find?
104;00:09:56,316;00:09:58,150;We can't live on
104;00:09:56,316;00:09:58,150;berries and roots.
105;00:09:58,184;00:10:00,903;I can.
106;00:10:00,937;00:10:02,738;You're not hungry?
107;00:10:02,772;00:10:05,024;Of course I'm hungry.
108;00:10:05,108;00:10:07,609;You're an awful travelling
108;00:10:05,108;00:10:07,609;companion, do you know that?
109;00:10:07,611;00:10:09,862;Possibly the least
109;00:10:07,611;00:10:09,862;charming man I've ever met.
110;00:10:09,913;00:10:11,547;I'm not your travelling
110;00:10:09,913;00:10:11,547;companion.
111;00:10:11,581;00:10:14,867;We are travelling together in
111;00:10:11,581;00:10:14,867;each other's company, therefore--
112;00:10:14,951;00:10:16,785;Do you ever shut up?
113;00:10:16,836;00:10:19,955;I sailed from King's Landing
113;00:10:16,836;00:10:19,955;to Pentos in a crate
114;00:10:20,006;00:10:22,458;without ever saying a word.
115;00:10:22,509;00:10:24,209;Why?
116;00:10:27,297;00:10:30,299;It never occurred to you
116;00:10:27,297;00:10:30,299;to ask why until now?
117;00:10:32,635;00:10:34,603;You never wondered
117;00:10:32,635;00:10:34,603;why Tyrion Lannister
118;00:10:34,637;00:10:37,306;decided to visit
118;00:10:34,637;00:10:37,306;a brothel in Volantis?
119;00:10:37,357;00:10:40,309;I'm sure you visited many
119;00:10:37,357;00:10:40,309;brothels in many cities.
120;00:10:42,445;00:10:44,146;I killed my father.
121;00:10:46,699;00:10:50,035;He wanted to execute me
121;00:10:46,699;00:10:50,035;for a crime I didn't commit.
122;00:10:52,655;00:10:54,907;And he was fucking
122;00:10:52,655;00:10:54,907;the woman I loved.
123;00:11:05,552;00:11:07,102;As miserable
123;00:11:05,552;00:11:07,102;as you are, Mormont,
124;00:11:07,137;00:11:08,670;at least your father
124;00:11:07,137;00:11:08,670;was a good man.
125;00:11:08,672;00:11:10,506;What do you know
125;00:11:08,672;00:11:10,506;about my father?
126;00:11:10,540;00:11:14,093;I met him.
126;00:11:10,540;00:11:14,093;I visited the Wall.
127;00:11:14,144;00:11:17,062;When I asked him about his men,
128;00:11:17,097;00:11:19,338;he knew all their stories,
128;00:11:17,097;00:11:19,338;every one of them.
129;00:11:19,349;00:11:22,935;He actually cared about the
129;00:11:19,349;00:11:22,935;people under his command.
130;00:11:23,019;00:11:26,355;How do they put it in the Watch?
131;00:11:26,406;00:11:29,158;We shall never see
131;00:11:26,406;00:11:29,158;his like again.
132;00:11:38,835;00:11:42,337;Oh, you didn't know.
133;00:11:47,710;00:11:50,712;I'm sorry.
133;00:11:47,710;00:11:50,712;I am.
134;00:11:53,049;00:11:54,550;How?
135;00:11:56,052;00:11:57,886;I only know what I heard.
136;00:11:57,937;00:11:59,104;How?
137;00:11:59,189;00:12:01,723;He was leading an
137;00:11:59,189;00:12:01,723;expedition beyond the Wall.
138;00:12:02,642;00:12:05,310;There was a mutiny.
139;00:12:05,361;00:12:07,629;He was murdered by his own men.
140;00:12:19,242;00:12:21,493;We better keep moving.
141;00:13:10,960;00:13:12,511;Valar morghulis.
142;00:13:12,579;00:13:14,646;Valar dohaeris.
143;00:13:16,082;00:13:18,383;I have nowhere else to go.
144;00:13:18,418;00:13:22,087;I've taken her to every
144;00:13:18,418;00:13:22,087;healer in Braavos.
145;00:13:22,121;00:13:25,123;I've spent every penny I had.
146;00:13:30,230;00:13:33,265;She suffers every day
146;00:13:30,230;00:13:33,265;of her life.
147;00:13:33,299;00:13:36,285;I just want it to end.
148;00:14:04,180;00:14:05,847;It hurts.
149;00:14:05,898;00:14:08,267;I know.
150;00:14:10,403;00:14:12,854;Don't be afraid.
151;00:14:12,905;00:14:16,308;I used to be like you.
152;00:14:16,342;00:14:18,477;I was sick.
153;00:14:19,746;00:14:21,747;I was dying.
154;00:14:24,600;00:14:28,287;But my father
154;00:14:24,600;00:14:28,287;never gave up on me.
155;00:14:30,707;00:14:33,492;He loved me
156;00:14:33,526;00:14:35,127;more than anything in the world,
157;00:14:35,178;00:14:37,913;just like your father loves you.
158;00:14:37,947;00:14:41,199;So he brought me here.
159;00:14:41,234;00:14:43,885;My father prayed
159;00:14:41,234;00:14:43,885;to the Many-Faced God.
160;00:14:46,022;00:14:48,223;And I drank the water
160;00:14:46,022;00:14:48,223;from his fountain.
161;00:14:49,442;00:14:51,293;It healed me.
162;00:15:03,906;00:15:06,491;I've devoted my life to him now.
163;00:15:08,011;00:15:10,172;You don't want to hurt anymore?
164;00:15:12,265;00:15:13,965;Drink.
165;00:17:58,297;00:18:00,248;Is a girl ready?
166;00:18:01,918;00:18:04,803;To give up her ears,
166;00:18:01,918;00:18:04,803;her nose, her tongue?
167;00:18:06,389;00:18:09,257;Her hopes and dreams,
167;00:18:06,389;00:18:09,257;her loves and hates?
168;00:18:09,308;00:18:12,093;All that makes a girl
168;00:18:09,308;00:18:12,093;who she is?
169;00:18:13,229;00:18:15,397;Forever?
170;00:18:18,518;00:18:20,936;No.
171;00:18:20,938;00:18:24,105;A girl is not ready
171;00:18:20,938;00:18:24,105;to become no one.
172;00:18:29,595;00:18:32,264;But she is ready
172;00:18:29,595;00:18:32,264;to become someone else.
173;00:18:45,545;00:18:48,597;Why Daenerys? Why is
173;00:18:45,545;00:18:48,597;she worth all this?
174;00:18:50,299;00:18:53,435;As I recall, the Mormonts
174;00:18:50,299;00:18:53,435;fought against the Targaryens
175;00:18:53,469;00:18:55,353;during Robert's Rebellion.
176;00:18:55,388;00:18:57,522;Do you believe in anything?
177;00:18:57,557;00:18:59,224;I believe in lots of things.
178;00:18:59,308;00:19:01,192;In something greater
178;00:18:59,308;00:19:01,192;than ourselves, I mean.
179;00:19:01,227;00:19:03,311;The gods, destiny.
180;00:19:03,362;00:19:06,565;Do you believe there's
180;00:19:03,362;00:19:06,565;a plan for this world?
181;00:19:06,649;00:19:09,067;No.
182;00:19:09,118;00:19:10,368;Neither did I.
183;00:19:10,403;00:19:12,787;I was a cynic just like you.
184;00:19:12,822;00:19:15,957;Then I saw a girl
184;00:19:12,822;00:19:15,957;step into a great fire
185;00:19:15,992;00:19:17,876;with three stone eggs.
186;00:19:17,910;00:19:20,712;When the fire burned out, I thought
186;00:19:17,910;00:19:20,712;I'd find her blackened bones.
187;00:19:20,746;00:19:24,833;Instead, I saw her, Daenerys,
188;00:19:24,884;00:19:28,887;alive and unhurt,
188;00:19:24,884;00:19:28,887;holding her baby dragons.
189;00:19:31,223;00:19:34,009;Have you ever heard
189;00:19:31,223;00:19:34,009;baby dragons singing?
190;00:19:34,060;00:19:35,760;No.
191;00:19:35,811;00:19:38,263;It's hard to be
191;00:19:35,811;00:19:38,263;a cynic after that.
192;00:19:40,182;00:19:42,434;Doesn't mean she's going
192;00:19:40,182;00:19:42,434;to be a great queen.
193;00:19:42,485;00:19:44,352;No, it doesn't.
194;00:19:44,403;00:19:46,688;The Targaryens
194;00:19:44,403;00:19:46,688;are famously insane.
195;00:19:46,690;00:19:49,608;What if she conquers the world?
195;00:19:46,690;00:19:49,608;Then what?
196;00:19:49,659;00:19:51,910;1,000 years of peace
196;00:19:49,659;00:19:51,910;and prosperity?
197;00:19:51,944;00:19:53,945;First we have
197;00:19:51,944;00:19:53,945;to conquer the world.
198;00:19:53,996;00:19:55,864;We?
199;00:19:55,866;00:19:58,083;All right, let's assume
199;00:19:55,866;00:19:58,083;your dreams come true.
200;00:19:58,167;00:20:01,453;She's ecstatic when you
200;00:19:58,167;00:20:01,453;bring her this enemy dwarf.
201;00:20:01,504;00:20:04,673;She hacks off my head
201;00:20:01,504;00:20:04,673;and restores your position.
202;00:20:04,707;00:20:07,008;You command her army,
202;00:20:04,707;00:20:07,008;sail to Westeros,
203;00:20:07,043;00:20:09,961;defeat all your enemies and
203;00:20:07,043;00:20:09,961;watch her climb those steps
204;00:20:10,012;00:20:11,463;and sit on the Iron Throne.
205;00:20:11,514;00:20:13,765;Hurrah. Long live the queen.
205;00:20:11,514;00:20:13,765;Then what?
206;00:20:13,799;00:20:15,383;Then she rules.
207;00:20:15,434;00:20:18,603;So a woman who has not spent a
207;00:20:15,434;00:20:18,603;single day of her adult life
208;00:20:18,638;00:20:21,356;in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros?
208;00:20:18,638;00:20:21,356;That's justice?
209;00:20:21,390;00:20:23,942;She's the rightful heir.
209;00:20:21,390;00:20:23,942;Why?
210;00:20:23,976;00:20:27,812;Because her father, who burned living
210;00:20:23,976;00:20:27,812;men for amusement, was the king?
211;00:20:31,200;00:20:33,485;That's a slave ship.
211;00:20:31,200;00:20:33,485;Why are they anchored?
212;00:20:33,536;00:20:35,320;They probably
212;00:20:33,536;00:20:35,320;came ashore for--
213;00:20:35,371;00:20:37,822;Water.
214;00:20:48,417;00:20:51,169;Got a lot of fight in you, huh?
215;00:20:59,428;00:21:01,479;Salt mines?
216;00:21:01,564;00:21:04,816;Yeah, that or a galley slave.
217;00:21:04,850;00:21:06,735;He looks strong enough.
218;00:21:06,769;00:21:09,571;What about the dwarf?
219;00:21:09,605;00:21:11,906;Worthless.
220;00:21:11,941;00:21:14,526;Cut his throat.
221;00:21:14,577;00:21:16,578;Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
221;00:21:14,577;00:21:16,578;Let's discuss this.
222;00:21:16,612;00:21:19,030;And then chop off his cock.
223;00:21:19,115;00:21:20,281;We'll sell it for a fortune.
224;00:21:20,332;00:21:22,450;A dwarf's cock has magic powers.
225;00:21:22,501;00:21:24,869;Wait! Wait!
226;00:21:24,920;00:21:26,287;Wait, wait, wait!
227;00:21:26,289;00:21:28,923;You can't just hand
227;00:21:26,289;00:21:28,923;a dry cock to a merchant
228;00:21:28,958;00:21:30,458;and expect him to pay for it.
229;00:21:30,460;00:21:32,460;He has to know
229;00:21:30,460;00:21:32,460;it came from a dwarf.
230;00:21:32,511;00:21:35,814;And how could he know
230;00:21:32,511;00:21:35,814;unless he sees the dwarf?
231;00:21:35,848;00:21:37,599;It will be
231;00:21:35,848;00:21:37,599;a dwarf-sized cock.
232;00:21:37,633;00:21:39,634;Guess again.
233;00:21:44,473;00:21:47,559;The dwarf lives until we
233;00:21:44,473;00:21:47,559;find a cock merchant.
234;00:21:56,235;00:21:58,737;Queen Daenerys
234;00:21:56,235;00:21:58,737;has outlawed slavery.
235;00:21:58,788;00:22:01,823;We're bound for Volantis,
235;00:21:58,788;00:22:01,823;not Slaver's Bay.
236;00:22:01,825;00:22:05,543;Besides, she reopened
236;00:22:01,825;00:22:05,543;the fighting pits.
237;00:22:05,578;00:22:08,246;I've never heard of free men
237;00:22:05,578;00:22:08,246;fighting in the pits.
238;00:22:08,297;00:22:10,498;The fighting pits in Meereen?
239;00:22:10,500;00:22:13,501;You're in luck, then.
239;00:22:10,500;00:22:13,501;You're about to be rich.
240;00:22:13,503;00:22:17,472;You are looking at one of the great
240;00:22:13,503;00:22:17,472;warriors in the Seven Kingdoms.
241;00:22:19,175;00:22:20,759;Him.
242;00:22:20,810;00:22:24,729;Him? He's got to
242;00:22:20,810;00:22:24,729;be 60 years old.
243;00:22:24,764;00:22:27,482;Sure, he's a bit
243;00:22:24,764;00:22:27,482;long in the tooth,
244;00:22:27,516;00:22:30,318;a bit withered,
244;00:22:27,516;00:22:30,318;been in the sun too long.
245;00:22:30,352;00:22:33,822;We can all see that. But he
245;00:22:30,352;00:22:33,822;is a veteran of 100 battles.
246;00:22:33,856;00:22:36,157;They wrote songs about him.
247;00:22:42,331;00:22:44,082;That true?
248;00:22:49,371;00:22:52,257;He won the tournament
248;00:22:49,371;00:22:52,257;at Lannisport.
249;00:22:52,291;00:22:54,926;Unseating Ser Jaime
249;00:22:52,291;00:22:54,926;Lannister himself.
250;00:22:56,178;00:22:59,214;The Kingslayer.
251;00:22:59,216;00:23:02,634;Jousting. You're talking
251;00:22:59,216;00:23:02,634;about jousting.
252;00:23:02,685;00:23:05,019;A fancy game for fancy lads.
253;00:23:05,054;00:23:07,806;The men who fight in the pits of
253;00:23:05,054;00:23:07,806;Meereen will swallow him whole.
254;00:23:07,857;00:23:10,897;I killed a Dothraki
254;00:23:07,857;00:23:10,897;bloodrider in single combat.
255;00:23:21,403;00:23:22,821;Liar.
256;00:23:22,872;00:23:25,540;It's no lie.
256;00:23:22,872;00:23:25,540;His name was Qotho.
257;00:23:25,574;00:23:28,459;He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo.
258;00:23:28,494;00:23:32,463;Take me to Slaver's Bay,
258;00:23:28,494;00:23:32,463;put a sword in my hand,
259;00:23:32,498;00:23:34,132;I'll prove my worth.
260;00:23:45,845;00:23:49,063;For my children.
260;00:23:45,845;00:23:49,063;Money.
261;00:23:52,685;00:23:54,736;Lord Baelish.
262;00:23:54,770;00:23:56,905;Yes?
263;00:23:58,240;00:24:00,275;Lancel Lannister.
264;00:24:02,444;00:24:04,412;Brother Lancel.
265;00:24:04,446;00:24:06,030;We abandon our family names.
266;00:24:06,081;00:24:07,866;Quite a family to abandon.
267;00:24:07,917;00:24:11,085;The city has changed
267;00:24:07,917;00:24:11,085;since you were here last.
268;00:24:11,120;00:24:13,004;We flooded the gutters
268;00:24:11,120;00:24:13,004;with wine,
269;00:24:13,038;00:24:15,506;smashed the false idols,
270;00:24:15,541;00:24:18,042;and set the godless on the run.
271;00:24:18,093;00:24:19,594;Well done.
272;00:24:25,050;00:24:28,269;I'm here on urgent business
272;00:24:25,050;00:24:28,269;for the Queen Mother.
273;00:24:28,304;00:24:31,272;Should I send word
273;00:24:28,304;00:24:31,272;that I'll be delayed?
274;00:24:35,027;00:24:36,694;Step carefully, Lord Baelish.
275;00:24:36,729;00:24:39,147;You'll find there's little
275;00:24:36,729;00:24:39,147;tolerance for flesh peddlers
276;00:24:39,198;00:24:40,732;in the new King's Landing.
277;00:24:40,783;00:24:43,618;We both peddle fantasies,
277;00:24:40,783;00:24:43,618;Brother Lancel.
278;00:24:43,652;00:24:46,154;Mine just happen
278;00:24:43,652;00:24:46,154;to be entertaining.
279;00:24:55,464;00:24:58,800;Do you think it's wise,
279;00:24:55,464;00:24:58,800;Your Grace,
280;00:24:58,834;00:25:00,635;arresting the heir
280;00:24:58,834;00:25:00,635;to Highgarden?
281;00:25:00,669;00:25:03,504;The Faith arrested
281;00:25:00,669;00:25:03,504;the heir to Highgarden.
282;00:25:03,506;00:25:06,667;Of course, and the Faith
282;00:25:03,506;00:25:06,667;were armed on your orders.
283;00:25:06,675;00:25:08,476;The king's orders.
284;00:25:08,510;00:25:10,595;Is the king to blame
284;00:25:08,510;00:25:10,595;for Ser Loras's perversion?
285;00:25:10,679;00:25:12,547;House Tyrell won't
285;00:25:10,679;00:25:12,547;tolerate this insult.
286;00:25:12,581;00:25:15,683;House Tyrell won't tolerate it?
287;00:25:15,734;00:25:17,685;I'm the insulted party,
287;00:25:15,734;00:25:17,685;Lord Baelish.
288;00:25:17,720;00:25:19,554;Ser Loras was promised to me.
289;00:25:19,588;00:25:21,572;Instead he chose
289;00:25:19,588;00:25:21,572;the company of boys.
290;00:25:21,607;00:25:23,927;One's choice of companion
290;00:25:21,607;00:25:23,927;is a curious thing.
291;00:25:26,629;00:25:28,196;Most curious.
292;00:25:30,366;00:25:32,533;Lysa Arryn, for instance.
293;00:25:32,535;00:25:34,569;Thoroughly repellant woman.
294;00:25:35,971;00:25:37,922;Forgive me.
295;00:25:37,957;00:25:39,924;I know you're still in mourning.
296;00:25:39,959;00:25:43,344;Lysa was a good woman.
297;00:25:43,379;00:25:44,679;A kind woman.
298;00:25:44,713;00:25:47,682;She was neither of those things.
298;00:25:44,713;00:25:47,682;We both know it.
299;00:25:47,716;00:25:49,717;Still, I pity her son.
300;00:25:49,752;00:25:52,020;How fortunate the young
300;00:25:49,752;00:25:52,020;Lord of the Vale
301;00:25:52,054;00:25:54,355;has a new father to counsel him.
302;00:25:54,390;00:25:56,391;I know how hard it can be
303;00:25:56,393;00:25:59,227;to lose both your parents
303;00:25:56,393;00:25:59,227;at such a young age.
304;00:25:59,229;00:26:02,229;If war comes to Westeros, will the Knights
304;00:25:59,229;00:26:02,229;of the Vale fight for their king?
305;00:26:03,315;00:26:05,650;Young Lord Robin
305;00:26:03,315;00:26:05,650;heeds my advice.
306;00:26:07,202;00:26:09,604;And I have always counseled
306;00:26:07,202;00:26:09,604;loyalty to the throne.
307;00:26:09,638;00:26:11,439;Good.
308;00:26:15,744;00:26:17,628;If there's nothing else.
309;00:26:18,747;00:26:20,581;There is another matter,
309;00:26:18,747;00:26:20,581;Your Grace.
310;00:26:20,632;00:26:23,334;Something so urgent I couldn't
310;00:26:20,632;00:26:23,334;trust the words to a raven.
311;00:26:23,419;00:26:26,270;You once charged me
311;00:26:23,419;00:26:26,270;with finding Arya Stark.
312;00:26:26,305;00:26:29,223;To my shame, I failed you.
313;00:26:29,258;00:26:31,559;But I have found Sansa Stark.
314;00:26:33,095;00:26:36,481;Alive and well and home again
315;00:26:36,515;00:26:37,982;living at Winterfell.
316;00:26:38,017;00:26:40,268;That's not possible.
317;00:26:40,319;00:26:42,653;My sources are well placed.
318;00:26:43,822;00:26:45,857;They tell me Roose Bolton
319;00:26:45,908;00:26:48,359;plans to marry her
319;00:26:45,908;00:26:48,359;to his son Ramsay,
320;00:26:48,410;00:26:51,079;a bastard recently
320;00:26:48,410;00:26:51,079;legitimized by King Tommen.
321;00:26:51,113;00:26:55,083;Roose Bolton is Warden of the
321;00:26:51,113;00:26:55,083;North by the grace of my father.
322;00:26:55,117;00:26:59,087;Indeed, his reward for stabbing
322;00:26:55,117;00:26:59,087;his own king in the heart.
323;00:27:00,372;00:27:02,507;We were fools
323;00:27:00,372;00:27:02,507;to trust a turncloak.
324;00:27:02,541;00:27:04,959;Marrying his son
324;00:27:02,541;00:27:04,959;to the last of the Starks
325;00:27:04,961;00:27:06,878;gives him more legitimacy
325;00:27:04,961;00:27:06,878;in the North
326;00:27:06,929;00:27:08,846;than an alliance with
326;00:27:06,929;00:27:08,846;a hated southern house.
327;00:27:08,881;00:27:12,266;I will skin him and his bastard
328;00:27:12,301;00:27:14,135;like that wretch
328;00:27:12,301;00:27:14,135;on their bloody sigil.
329;00:27:14,137;00:27:15,970;I would counsel
329;00:27:14,137;00:27:15,970;patience, Your Grace.
330;00:27:15,972;00:27:17,855;Patience?
331;00:27:17,890;00:27:19,440;Sansa helped murder my son.
332;00:27:19,475;00:27:21,025;Roose Bolton is a traitor.
333;00:27:21,060;00:27:23,027;Stannis Baratheon
333;00:27:21,060;00:27:23,027;is also a traitor,
334;00:27:23,112;00:27:24,679;marching with his army
334;00:27:23,112;00:27:24,679;on Winterfell.
335;00:27:24,713;00:27:27,198;Let Stannis and Roose battle.
336;00:27:27,232;00:27:29,867;Let the enemies of the
336;00:27:27,232;00:27:29,867;throne slaughter each other.
337;00:27:29,902;00:27:33,271;And when they're done, seize Winterfell
337;00:27:29,902;00:27:33,271;from whichever thief survives.
338;00:27:33,305;00:27:35,790;Winterfell is 1,000 miles
338;00:27:33,305;00:27:35,790;away from here.
339;00:27:35,824;00:27:37,992;The weather has already
339;00:27:35,824;00:27:37,992;begun to turn.
340;00:27:37,994;00:27:40,928;That is why it is critical
340;00:27:37,994;00:27:40,928;to strike soon
341;00:27:40,963;00:27:43,381;while the victor
341;00:27:40,963;00:27:43,381;still licks his wounds.
342;00:27:45,167;00:27:47,468;Surely your Uncle Kevan
342;00:27:45,167;00:27:47,468;could muster a force.
343;00:27:47,503;00:27:50,838;My Uncle Kevan has all the
343;00:27:47,503;00:27:50,838;courage of a kitchen mouse.
344;00:27:50,873;00:27:52,457;Ser Jaime, then.
345;00:27:52,491;00:27:55,093;Jaime's away on a sensitive
345;00:27:52,491;00:27:55,093;diplomatic mission.
346;00:27:55,127;00:27:57,845;I have no idea
346;00:27:55,127;00:27:57,845;when he'll be back.
347;00:27:57,896;00:28:00,348;Perhaps I can help.
348;00:28:00,350;00:28:03,518;The Knights of the Vale are some
348;00:28:00,350;00:28:03,518;of the best fighters in Westeros,
349;00:28:03,569;00:28:05,787;trained to battle
349;00:28:03,569;00:28:05,787;in the ice and the snow.
350;00:28:05,821;00:28:08,689;Forgive me, Lord Baelish,
351;00:28:08,740;00:28:10,942;you have a reputation
351;00:28:08,740;00:28:10,942;as a moneylender
352;00:28:10,993;00:28:13,528;and a brothel keeper,
352;00:28:10,993;00:28:13,528;not a military man.
353;00:28:13,579;00:28:15,713;You wouldn't risk
353;00:28:13,579;00:28:15,713;a single Lannister soldier
354;00:28:15,747;00:28:19,167;or a single coin
354;00:28:15,747;00:28:19,167;from the royal treasury.
355;00:28:19,201;00:28:20,918;What do you have to lose?
356;00:28:20,953;00:28:22,820;A brothel keeper?
357;00:28:22,855;00:28:24,372;And if you succeed?
358;00:28:24,374;00:28:26,541;Name me Warden of the North.
359;00:28:30,963;00:28:34,432;I'll speak to the king
359;00:28:30,963;00:28:34,432;this evening,
360;00:28:34,466;00:28:36,634;have him issue a royal decree.
361;00:28:36,668;00:28:39,520;I'll not rest until the
361;00:28:36,668;00:28:39,520;lion flies over Winterfell.
362;00:28:39,555;00:28:41,839;And I'll know
362;00:28:39,555;00:28:41,839;you're a man of your word
363;00:28:41,874;00:28:44,892;when I see Sansa Stark's
363;00:28:41,874;00:28:44,892;head on a spike.
364;00:28:44,943;00:28:47,028;As I said...
365;00:28:47,062;00:28:49,013;I live to serve.
366;00:28:54,486;00:28:57,655;I'm going to ask him tomorrow.
367;00:28:59,241;00:29:00,958;What if he says no?
367;00:28:59,241;00:29:00,958;He won't.
368;00:29:01,043;00:29:03,411;We've waited long enough.
369;00:29:03,462;00:29:05,663;I want you to be my wife.
370;00:29:05,714;00:29:07,748;Now.
371;00:29:09,051;00:29:10,668;What is it?
372;00:29:10,702;00:29:13,638;Do you want to marry me because
372;00:29:10,702;00:29:13,638;our families arranged it?
373;00:29:13,672;00:29:15,556;Or do you--
374;00:29:22,981;00:29:25,600;We can't.
374;00:29:22,981;00:29:25,600;Not yet.
375;00:29:25,602;00:29:26,817;Why not?
376;00:29:26,852;00:29:28,903;You know why not.
376;00:29:26,852;00:29:28,903;Someone will see.
377;00:29:28,937;00:29:31,272;You are going to be my wife.
378;00:29:31,323;00:29:35,359;I am going to be your husband.
379;00:29:35,410;00:29:38,946;We're allowed to walk through
379;00:29:35,410;00:29:38,946;the gardens together.
380;00:29:38,948;00:29:41,616;How many other girls have you
380;00:29:38,948;00:29:41,616;walked through these gardens?
381;00:29:43,585;00:29:46,254;I like the way your eyes go
381;00:29:43,585;00:29:46,254;squinty when you're jealous.
382;00:29:46,288;00:29:49,840;They do not go squinty and you
382;00:29:46,288;00:29:49,840;didn't answer the question.
383;00:29:49,875;00:29:52,310;They make a lovely couple.
384;00:29:52,344;00:29:55,513;A Lannister and a Martell.
385;00:29:55,547;00:29:58,966;They have no idea
385;00:29:55,547;00:29:58,966;how dangerous that is.
386;00:29:59,001;00:30:01,202;We must protect them.
387;00:30:01,236;00:30:03,204;Yes, my prince.
388;00:30:04,840;00:30:07,942;You haven't had to use that
388;00:30:04,840;00:30:07,942;axe of yours in a long time.
389;00:30:09,645;00:30:11,279;I hope you remember how.
390;00:30:11,313;00:30:13,981;I remember how.
391;00:30:16,318;00:30:20,197;The Dornishman's
391;00:30:16,318;00:30:20,197;wife was as fair as the sun
392;00:30:20,231;00:30:25,319;And her kisses
392;00:30:20,231;00:30:25,319;were warmer than spring
393;00:30:25,353;00:30:27,271;The Dornishman's blade
394;00:30:27,322;00:30:29,606;It was made of black steel
395;00:30:29,657;00:30:34,111;And its kiss
395;00:30:29,657;00:30:34,111;was a terrible thing
396;00:30:34,162;00:30:38,365;The Dornishman's wife
396;00:30:34,162;00:30:38,365;would sing as she bathed
397;00:30:38,416;00:30:42,453;In a voice that was sweet as a peach--
397;00:30:38,416;00:30:42,453;All right, that's enough.
398;00:30:42,504;00:30:44,621;I'm coming to the best part.
399;00:30:44,672;00:30:46,623;We're trying to blend in.
400;00:30:46,625;00:30:48,709;Don't want everyone in
400;00:30:46,625;00:30:48,709;Dorne to hear your accent.
401;00:30:48,760;00:30:50,544;This song really is
401;00:30:48,760;00:30:50,544;all about the ending.
402;00:30:50,628;00:30:52,930;It can wait.
402;00:30:50,628;00:30:52,930;There.
403;00:30:56,301;00:30:58,135;That's the Water Gardens.
404;00:30:58,137;00:31:00,687;And once we've got
404;00:30:58,137;00:31:00,687;the princess, then what?
405;00:31:03,108;00:31:05,859;I like to improvise.
406;00:31:05,894;00:31:08,245;That explains the golden hand.
407;00:31:27,715;00:31:32,136;Unbowed. Unbent.
407;00:31:27,715;00:31:32,136;Unbroken.
408;00:31:33,671;00:31:34,671;For Oberyn.
409;00:31:34,722;00:31:36,673;For Oberyn.
410;00:32:16,214;00:32:18,498;Well, she's made
410;00:32:16,214;00:32:18,498;herself at home.
411;00:32:24,189;00:32:26,440;Myrcella.
412;00:32:28,977;00:32:30,861;Uncle Jaime?
413;00:32:30,895;00:32:32,896;I--
414;00:32:32,947;00:32:35,148;I don't understand.
414;00:32:32,947;00:32:35,148;What are you doing here?
415;00:32:35,200;00:32:37,401;Let's speak in private.
416;00:32:37,403;00:32:40,237;I am Trystane Martell.
416;00:32:37,403;00:32:40,237;Trystane is my intended.
417;00:32:40,288;00:32:43,207;Excellent.
417;00:32:40,288;00:32:43,207;Good to meet you.
418;00:32:43,241;00:32:45,209;We weren't expecting you,
418;00:32:43,241;00:32:45,209;Lord Jaime.
419;00:32:45,243;00:32:47,995;Why don't you let them
419;00:32:45,243;00:32:47,995;have some time alone, son?
420;00:32:52,467;00:32:54,668;Let's not do something stupid.
421;00:32:59,040;00:33:00,974;That was something stupid.
422;00:33:01,009;00:33:02,559;We have to go, Myrcella, now.
423;00:33:02,594;00:33:04,678;You hurt him!
423;00:33:02,594;00:33:04,678;He'll be fine, I promise.
424;00:33:04,729;00:33:06,430;But we have to--
425;00:33:10,435;00:33:12,319;Oh, for fuck's sake.
426;00:33:54,145;00:33:55,395;Take her!
427;00:33:58,032;00:33:59,783;You're coming with me.
427;00:33:58,032;00:33:59,783;I don't want to.
428;00:33:59,817;00:34:02,018;I wasn't asking, princess.
429;00:34:08,710;00:34:11,411;Ah!
429;00:34:08,710;00:34:11,411;Drop your weapons!
430;00:34:19,587;00:34:21,922;I am Obara Sand.
431;00:34:21,973;00:34:24,341;Daughter of Oberyn Martell.
432;00:34:24,392;00:34:27,678;I fight for Dorne.
432;00:34:24,392;00:34:27,678;Who do you fight for?
433;00:34:27,729;00:34:29,680;Drop your weapons.
434;00:34:47,081;00:34:51,034;When you were whole, it would
434;00:34:47,081;00:34:51,034;have been a good fight.
435;00:35:01,462;00:35:03,547;You fight pretty good
435;00:35:01,462;00:35:03,547;for a little girl.
436;00:35:30,408;00:35:32,459;Halt!
437;00:35:34,746;00:35:38,665;Oh, you can smell the shit
437;00:35:34,746;00:35:38,665;from five miles away.
438;00:35:38,716;00:35:40,884;Well, why have we stopped?
438;00:35:38,716;00:35:40,884;Go on.
439;00:35:44,772;00:35:47,224;Rumors and gossip,
439;00:35:44,772;00:35:47,224;that's all they've got.
440;00:35:47,258;00:35:49,393;It's theater, nothing more.
441;00:35:49,427;00:35:52,562;If they arrested all the pillow
441;00:35:49,427;00:35:52,562;biters in King's Landing,
442;00:35:52,597;00:35:55,599;there'd be no room left in the
442;00:35:52,597;00:35:55,599;dungeons for anyone else.
443;00:35:55,650;00:35:57,517;Everyone knew
443;00:35:55,650;00:35:57,517;about him and Renly.
444;00:35:57,568;00:36:01,104;Renly Baratheon shagged half the
444;00:35:57,568;00:36:01,104;stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms.
445;00:36:01,106;00:36:02,989;Everyone knew, no one cared.
446;00:36:03,024;00:36:04,608;But he was the king's brother.
447;00:36:04,659;00:36:06,443;And Loras
447;00:36:04,659;00:36:06,443;is the queen's brother.
448;00:36:06,445;00:36:08,912;No, no, no, no.
448;00:36:06,445;00:36:08,912;This is unacceptable.
449;00:36:08,946;00:36:11,026;Cersei's behind it.
449;00:36:08,946;00:36:11,026;Yeah, of course she is.
450;00:36:11,032;00:36:13,450;She wants to drag our
450;00:36:11,032;00:36:13,450;name through the dirt,
451;00:36:13,501;00:36:15,335;put us in our place.
452;00:36:15,369;00:36:17,454;Get some rest, dear.
452;00:36:15,369;00:36:17,454;You look appalling.
453;00:36:17,505;00:36:19,673;Let me deal
453;00:36:17,505;00:36:19,673;with Cersei Lannister.
454;00:36:25,713;00:36:29,182;Your Grace, I have
454;00:36:25,713;00:36:29,182;travelled a long way.
455;00:36:29,217;00:36:31,685;You must be exhausted.
456;00:36:34,021;00:36:36,857;Put the pen down, dear. We both
456;00:36:34,021;00:36:36,857;know you're not writing anything.
457;00:36:36,891;00:36:40,227;Ah, yes. The famously
457;00:36:36,891;00:36:40,227;tart-tongued Queen of Thorns.
458;00:36:40,294;00:36:43,280;And the famous tart
458;00:36:40,294;00:36:43,280;Queen Cersei.
459;00:36:46,984;00:36:48,568;I beg your pardon?
460;00:36:48,619;00:36:52,205;I know you're behind this absurd
460;00:36:48,619;00:36:52,205;incarceration of my grandson.
461;00:36:52,240;00:36:55,075;If you apologize for that
461;00:36:52,240;00:36:55,075;comment, perhaps I'll--
462;00:36:55,126;00:36:57,994;You'll get your apology
462;00:36:55,126;00:36:57,994;when I get Loras.
463;00:36:59,213;00:37:01,081;I was as shocked as anyone
464;00:37:01,132;00:37:03,750;when the Faith
464;00:37:01,132;00:37:03,750;arrested Ser Loras.
465;00:37:03,801;00:37:06,386;I have no love
465;00:37:03,801;00:37:06,386;for these fanatics,
466;00:37:06,420;00:37:09,022;but what can a Queen Mother do?
467;00:37:10,341;00:37:12,259;Has the crown
467;00:37:10,341;00:37:12,259;suddenly stopped needing
468;00:37:12,310;00:37:15,562;the troops, gold, and
468;00:37:12,310;00:37:15,562;wheat my house supplies?
469;00:37:15,646;00:37:17,647;I can assure you,
470;00:37:17,682;00:37:19,683;our alliance with
470;00:37:17,682;00:37:19,683;House Tyrell remains--
471;00:37:19,734;00:37:21,351;Do you expect
471;00:37:19,734;00:37:21,351;the alliance to continue
472;00:37:21,402;00:37:24,104;after you've thrown
472;00:37:21,402;00:37:24,104;our future into prison?
473;00:37:24,188;00:37:26,490;As I said,
474;00:37:26,524;00:37:28,975;I didn't imprison anyone.
475;00:37:29,010;00:37:30,410;As for your
475;00:37:29,010;00:37:30,410;veiled threats--
476;00:37:30,444;00:37:31,895;What veil?
477;00:37:34,248;00:37:38,752;The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought
477;00:37:34,248;00:37:38,752;peace to a war-torn country.
478;00:37:38,819;00:37:42,038;Do you really want to see the Seven
478;00:37:38,819;00:37:42,038;Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
479;00:37:45,176;00:37:46,710;I didn't trust your father.
480;00:37:46,761;00:37:49,379;I didn't particularly like him.
481;00:37:49,381;00:37:52,933;But I respected him.
481;00:37:49,381;00:37:52,933;He was no fool.
482;00:37:52,967;00:37:56,686;He understood that sometimes
482;00:37:52,967;00:37:56,686;we must work with our rivals
483;00:37:56,721;00:37:58,271;rather than destroy them.
484;00:37:58,306;00:38:00,524;House Lannister has no rival.
485;00:38:02,944;00:38:06,429;The High Septon has called
485;00:38:02,944;00:38:06,429;for an inquest, not a trial.
486;00:38:06,464;00:38:08,148;Just a small hearing
486;00:38:06,464;00:38:08,148;to determine
487;00:38:08,199;00:38:11,034;whether the charges
487;00:38:08,199;00:38:11,034;against Loras have merit,
488;00:38:11,068;00:38:13,086;which I'm sure they don't.
489;00:38:13,120;00:38:16,606;Loras will be freed, our happy
489;00:38:13,120;00:38:16,606;alliance will continue...
490;00:38:18,326;00:38:21,244;and we'll forget this unfortunate
490;00:38:18,326;00:38:21,244;conversation ever happened.
491;00:38:23,047;00:38:24,581;Good day, Lady Olenna.
492;00:38:44,235;00:38:46,987;You are aware of the rumors
492;00:38:44,235;00:38:46,987;concerning you and Renly?
493;00:38:48,105;00:38:50,690;I don't pay attention to rumors.
494;00:38:50,741;00:38:54,060;You were said to be
494;00:38:50,741;00:38:54,060;despondent when he died.
495;00:38:54,095;00:38:57,631;Witnesses state that you
495;00:38:54,095;00:38:57,631;refused to leave his bedside
496;00:38:57,665;00:39:00,200;even as Stannis's army
496;00:38:57,665;00:39:00,200;closed in.
497;00:39:00,251;00:39:04,087;He was my friend.
497;00:39:00,251;00:39:04,087;He was my king.
498;00:39:04,121;00:39:06,539;Wasn't Joffrey your king?
499;00:39:06,591;00:39:09,593;He was anointed
499;00:39:06,591;00:39:09,593;by the Seven, not Renly.
500;00:39:09,627;00:39:14,180;I was wrong to support
500;00:39:09,627;00:39:14,180;Renly's claim, I know that.
501;00:39:15,349;00:39:17,767;But I was forgiven by Joffrey.
502;00:39:17,802;00:39:20,270;I fought for him at the
502;00:39:17,802;00:39:20,270;Battle of Blackwater.
503;00:39:20,304;00:39:23,974;Yes, wearing Renly's armor.
504;00:39:23,976;00:39:26,359;Why does it matter what I wore?
505;00:39:26,394;00:39:29,029;Do you deny all
505;00:39:26,394;00:39:29,029;the charges against you?
506;00:39:29,063;00:39:31,114;Fornication.
507;00:39:31,148;00:39:33,316;Buggery.
507;00:39:31,148;00:39:33,316;Blasphemy.
508;00:39:33,318;00:39:34,951;Of course I deny them.
509;00:39:34,986;00:39:37,037;You never lay
509;00:39:34,986;00:39:37,037;with Renly Baratheon?
510;00:39:37,071;00:39:39,022;Never.
511;00:39:39,056;00:39:41,207;Nor any other man?
512;00:39:41,242;00:39:42,859;Never.
513;00:39:45,212;00:39:47,831;That will be all, Ser Loras.
514;00:39:55,006;00:39:57,724;Well, I think that's
514;00:39:55,006;00:39:57,724;quite enough of that.
515;00:39:57,758;00:40:00,343;The Faith calls
515;00:39:57,758;00:40:00,343;Queen Margaery forward.
516;00:40:00,394;00:40:02,345;You call me forward?
517;00:40:02,430;00:40:04,731;Yes, we have some
517;00:40:02,430;00:40:04,731;questions for you.
518;00:40:04,765;00:40:08,868;I am the queen.
518;00:40:04,765;00:40:08,868;You are.
519;00:40:08,903;00:40:11,338;And according
519;00:40:08,903;00:40:11,338;to the law of the Seven,
520;00:40:11,372;00:40:13,773;neither kings
520;00:40:11,372;00:40:13,773;nor queens are exempt
521;00:40:13,824;00:40:16,693;from testimony
521;00:40:13,824;00:40:16,693;at a holy inquest.
522;00:40:34,712;00:40:38,381;How do you respond to these
522;00:40:34,712;00:40:38,381;charges against your brother?
523;00:40:38,383;00:40:40,150;They are lies.
524;00:40:40,184;00:40:41,851;All of them?
524;00:40:40,184;00:40:41,851;All of them.
525;00:40:41,886;00:40:44,838;Queen Margaery,
526;00:40:44,872;00:40:46,389;in the presence of the gods,
527;00:40:46,424;00:40:48,641;do you swear that your
527;00:40:46,424;00:40:48,641;brother is innocent
528;00:40:48,693;00:40:50,560;of these charges against him
529;00:40:50,611;00:40:52,228;to the best of your knowledge?
530;00:40:52,230;00:40:54,314;Yes, I swear it.
531;00:40:55,566;00:40:57,817;Thank you, Your Grace.
532;00:41:23,344;00:41:25,095;Do you know this man?
533;00:41:25,146;00:41:28,648;Yes, very well.
534;00:41:28,682;00:41:31,434;He is Ser Loras Tyrell,
534;00:41:28,682;00:41:31,434;heir to Highgarden.
535;00:41:31,436;00:41:34,104;How did you come to meet?
536;00:41:34,155;00:41:36,773;I squired for him.
537;00:41:36,807;00:41:38,608;He took a liking to me.
538;00:41:38,659;00:41:41,820;He summoned me to his chamber
538;00:41:38,659;00:41:41,820;the first day we met.
539;00:41:42,863;00:41:46,616;And what occurred
539;00:41:42,863;00:41:46,616;in his chamber?
540;00:41:46,618;00:41:51,121;We engaged
540;00:41:46,618;00:41:51,121;in intimate relations.
541;00:41:51,123;00:41:52,956;You lay with him?
542;00:41:53,007;00:41:54,541;That night and many others.
543;00:41:54,592;00:41:57,043;Liar.
543;00:41:54,592;00:41:57,043;He's a liar.
544;00:41:58,596;00:42:00,463;Is there anyone else
544;00:41:58,596;00:42:00,463;who can support your claim?
545;00:42:00,465;00:42:02,766;Yes.
546;00:42:02,800;00:42:05,685;Yes, Queen Margaery.
547;00:42:05,770;00:42:09,105;She walked in on us once
547;00:42:05,770;00:42:09,105;not long ago.
548;00:42:09,140;00:42:11,808;She didn't seem surprised.
549;00:42:11,859;00:42:15,779;This testimony is an insult
549;00:42:11,859;00:42:15,779;to a great house.
550;00:42:15,813;00:42:18,982;Why should the Faith or anyone
550;00:42:15,813;00:42:18,982;else take the word of a squire
551;00:42:18,984;00:42:20,650;over the heir to Highgarden?
552;00:42:20,701;00:42:22,702;He has a birthmark, Your Grace.
553;00:42:22,787;00:42:25,655;Quite high on his thigh.
554;00:42:25,706;00:42:28,725;Wine-colored and roughly
554;00:42:25,706;00:42:28,725;the shape of Dorne.
555;00:42:28,793;00:42:31,294;No! Liar!
556;00:42:33,080;00:42:37,000;What are you doing?
556;00:42:33,080;00:42:37,000;Let us pass.
557;00:42:37,002;00:42:39,502;The Faith is satisfied
557;00:42:37,002;00:42:39,502;there is enough evidence
558;00:42:39,553;00:42:41,471;to bring a formal trial
559;00:42:41,505;00:42:43,756;for Ser Loras
560;00:42:43,808;00:42:45,592;and Queen Margaery.
561;00:42:45,643;00:42:46,893;What?
562;00:42:46,927;00:42:48,978;Bearing false witness
562;00:42:46,927;00:42:48,978;before the gods
563;00:42:49,013;00:42:51,648;is as grave a sin
563;00:42:49,013;00:42:51,648;as any, my lady.
564;00:42:51,682;00:42:53,399;Take her.
565;00:42:53,484;00:42:56,152;No. Tommen.
566;00:42:56,187;00:42:57,937;Tommen!
567;00:42:59,190;00:43:01,274;You can't do this.
567;00:42:59,190;00:43:01,274;I am the queen.
568;00:43:01,325;00:43:03,993;Tommen!
568;00:43:01,325;00:43:03,993;Tommen!
569;00:43:04,028;00:43:06,529;I am your queen.
569;00:43:04,028;00:43:06,529;How dare you?
570;00:43:06,531;00:43:08,064;Take your hands off me!
571;00:43:08,132;00:43:10,750;Tommen!
572;00:43:33,974;00:43:36,142;What do you want?
573;00:43:36,193;00:43:39,028;Lord Ramsay sent me to
573;00:43:36,193;00:43:39,028;draw you a bath, my lady.
574;00:43:39,063;00:43:41,798;You want to be clean and fresh
575;00:43:41,832;00:43:43,872;for your new husband, don't you?
576;00:44:00,467;00:44:03,086;You're so beautiful,
577;00:44:03,088;00:44:06,139;but you need to keep him happy.
578;00:44:06,173;00:44:10,426;Ramsay gets bored easily.
579;00:44:10,477;00:44:12,595;You don't want
579;00:44:10,477;00:44:12,595;to end up like--
580;00:44:14,565;00:44:17,183;well, like the others.
581;00:44:17,234;00:44:19,569;What others?
582;00:44:19,603;00:44:21,854;I shouldn't gossip.
583;00:44:21,906;00:44:24,490;Oh, it's good to see
583;00:44:21,906;00:44:24,490;the red again.
584;00:44:24,525;00:44:26,526;No point hiding anymore.
585;00:44:26,577;00:44:28,027;What others?
586;00:44:28,078;00:44:30,663;Let's see, there was Kyra
587;00:44:30,698;00:44:32,665;the blacksmith's daughter.
588;00:44:32,750;00:44:35,285;She was tall like you,
588;00:44:32,750;00:44:35,285;lovely figure.
589;00:44:35,336;00:44:39,789;But she talked
589;00:44:35,336;00:44:39,789;and talked and talked
590;00:44:39,840;00:44:43,209;and Ramsay grew tired of that.
591;00:44:43,260;00:44:45,762;Then there was Violet.
592;00:44:45,796;00:44:48,298;She had gorgeous blonde hair.
593;00:44:48,349;00:44:51,301;But she got pregnant.
594;00:44:51,303;00:44:54,220;And, well, that was boring.
595;00:44:54,271;00:44:57,941;Then Tansy.
596;00:44:57,975;00:44:59,609;Such a sweet girl.
597;00:44:59,643;00:45:04,814;Of course, sweet girls
597;00:44:59,643;00:45:04,814;get a bit dull
598;00:45:04,865;00:45:06,950;after a while, don't they?
599;00:45:06,984;00:45:09,285;Ramsay let me come
599;00:45:06,984;00:45:09,285;with him on that hunt.
600;00:45:09,320;00:45:10,453;Hunt?
601;00:45:10,487;00:45:12,322;Mmm.
602;00:45:14,375;00:45:18,661;Have you ever seen a body after
602;00:45:14,375;00:45:18,661;the dogs have been at it?
603;00:45:18,712;00:45:20,580;Not so pretty.
604;00:45:22,549;00:45:25,718;But, well, it's your
604;00:45:22,549;00:45:25,718;wedding day.
605;00:45:26,134;00:45:28,253;Why am I talking
605;00:45:26,134;00:45:28,253;about such things?
606;00:45:30,557;00:45:32,342;What was your name again?
607;00:45:32,393;00:45:34,010;Myranda.
608;00:45:36,230;00:45:38,848;And how long have yo
608;00:45:36,230;00:45:38,848;loved him, Myranda?
609;00:45:42,236;00:45:45,357;Did you imagine that he would be
609;00:45:42,236;00:45:45,357;with you forever, is that it?
610;00:45:45,406;00:45:47,573;And I came along and ruined it.
611;00:45:50,778;00:45:54,197;I'm Sansa Stark of Winterfell.
612;00:45:54,248;00:45:58,668;This is my home
612;00:45:54,248;00:45:58,668;and you can't frighten me.
613;00:46:04,475;00:46:07,260;Are you done with
613;00:46:04,475;00:46:07,260;your bath, my lady?
614;00:46:08,262;00:46:10,262;Go. I can finish
614;00:46:08,262;00:46:10,262;on my own.
615;00:46:34,705;00:46:37,240;Yes?
616;00:46:44,715;00:46:49,268;I've come to escort you
616;00:46:44,715;00:46:49,268;to the godswood, my lady.
617;00:46:53,841;00:46:57,143;If you please, my lady,
617;00:46:53,841;00:46:57,143;will you take my arm?
618;00:46:57,227;00:46:59,679;No.
619;00:46:59,730;00:47:03,015;Lord Ramsay, he said
619;00:46:59,730;00:47:03,015;I'm to take your arm.
620;00:47:03,067;00:47:04,567;I'm not touching you.
621;00:47:06,487;00:47:08,404;Please.
622;00:47:08,439;00:47:10,406;He'll punish me.
623;00:47:12,276;00:47:14,944;You think I care
623;00:47:12,276;00:47:14,944;what he does to you?
624;00:48:32,022;00:48:34,991;Who comes before
624;00:48:32,022;00:48:34,991;the old gods this night?
625;00:48:36,193;00:48:39,612;Sansa of the House Stark
626;00:48:39,663;00:48:42,365;comes here to be wed.
627;00:48:44,535;00:48:48,287;A woman grown,
627;00:48:44,535;00:48:48,287;trueborn and noble.
628;00:48:48,338;00:48:52,758;She comes to beg the
628;00:48:48,338;00:48:52,758;blessings of the gods.
629;00:48:54,595;00:48:56,712;Who comes to claim her?
630;00:49:05,639;00:49:07,607;Ramsay of House Bolton.
631;00:49:08,942;00:49:11,227;Heir to the Dreadfort
631;00:49:08,942;00:49:11,227;and Winterfell.
632;00:49:13,730;00:49:16,199;Who gives her?
633;00:49:18,452;00:49:23,656;Theon of House Greyjoy,
633;00:49:18,452;00:49:23,656;who was--
634;00:49:28,078;00:49:29,629;who was her father's ward.
635;00:49:31,915;00:49:35,468;Lady Sansa,
635;00:49:31,915;00:49:35,468;will you take this man?
636;00:50:05,249;00:50:07,066;I take this man.
637;00:50:38,565;00:50:40,733;Are you pleased, my lady?
638;00:50:43,487;00:50:46,522;Good. I want you
638;00:50:43,487;00:50:46,522;to be happy.
639;00:50:56,717;00:50:59,385;My father said
639;00:50:56,717;00:50:59,385;you're still a virgin.
640;00:51:05,008;00:51:07,677;Uh, yes.
640;00:51:05,008;00:51:07,677;Why?
641;00:51:11,348;00:51:14,600;Why are you still a virgin?
642;00:51:15,286;00:51:16,905;Afraid of dwarves?
643;00:51:18,438;00:51:20,523;Lord-- Lord Tyrion was kind.
644;00:51:20,574;00:51:24,126;He was gentle.
644;00:51:20,574;00:51:24,126;He never touched me.
645;00:51:25,762;00:51:27,113;You're not lying to me?
646;00:51:27,197;00:51:28,948;No, my lord.
647;00:51:28,982;00:51:31,717;Lying to your husband
647;00:51:28,982;00:51:31,717;on his wedding night,
648;00:51:31,752;00:51:35,254;that would be a bad way
648;00:51:31,752;00:51:35,254;to start a marriage.
649;00:51:40,177;00:51:43,295;We're man and wife now.
650;00:51:43,347;00:51:45,381;We should be honest
650;00:51:43,347;00:51:45,381;with each other.
651;00:51:45,515;00:51:47,216;Don't you think?
652;00:51:48,218;00:51:50,136;Yes.
653;00:52:00,147;00:52:01,981;Good.
654;00:52:04,234;00:52:06,068;Take off your clothes.
655;00:52:10,040;00:52:12,074;Oh, no, no, no.
656;00:52:12,159;00:52:15,127;You stay here, Reek.
657;00:52:15,162;00:52:17,413;You watch.
658;00:52:29,476;00:52:32,495;Do I need to ask a second time?
659;00:52:32,562;00:52:34,764;I hate asking a second time.
660;00:53:02,709;00:53:03,926;Reek...
661;00:53:03,960;00:53:07,163;I told you to watch.
662;00:53:12,903;00:53:15,971;You've known Sansa
662;00:53:12,903;00:53:15,971;since she was a girl.
663;00:53:17,274;00:53:18,892;Now watch her become a woman.
664;00:54:00,260;00:54:10,860;
664;00:54:00,260;00:54:10,860;9999
664;00:54:00,260;00:54:10,860;00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
