1;00:03:44,257;00:03:46,291;Here we are.
2;00:03:54,133;00:03:56,218;Ready?
3;00:04:01,357;00:04:03,392;The Rains of Castamere.
4;00:04:03,443;00:04:05,477;You fucking deaf?
5;00:04:05,528;00:04:07,813;Same wrong guess
5;00:04:05,528;00:04:07,813;every fucking time.
6;00:04:07,847;00:04:09,231;Listen, you cunt.
7;00:04:09,282;00:04:11,450;Oh!
8;00:04:14,238;00:04:16,371;The Bear
8;00:04:14,238;00:04:16,371;and the Maiden Fair.
9;00:04:18,357;00:04:20,075;There's a man
9;00:04:18,357;00:04:20,075;with an ear.
10;00:04:20,126;00:04:22,527;Too bad you got
10;00:04:20,126;00:04:22,527;a hangnail for a cock.
11;00:04:24,497;00:04:26,465;First time I saw you
11;00:04:24,497;00:04:26,465;with your breeches down,
12;00:04:26,499;00:04:28,166;I thought you were
12;00:04:26,499;00:04:28,166;a eunuch.
13;00:04:28,200;00:04:30,719;You've seen it, girls.
14;00:04:30,753;00:04:33,672;Like a baby snail
14;00:04:30,753;00:04:33,672;peeking out of his shell.
15;00:04:47,820;00:04:50,105;Your baby was crying
15;00:04:47,820;00:04:50,105;this morning.
16;00:04:55,611;00:04:58,030;Woke me up.
17;00:04:58,081;00:04:59,748;You hear me?
18;00:04:59,782;00:05:01,249;Yes.
19;00:05:01,284;00:05:03,702;Well, got
19;00:05:01,284;00:05:03,702;anything to say?
20;00:05:03,736;00:05:05,737;I'm sorry
20;00:05:03,736;00:05:05,737;he woke you up.
21;00:05:05,755;00:05:08,924;I don't care
21;00:05:05,755;00:05:08,924;if you're sorry.
22;00:05:08,958;00:05:11,710;Keep that baby quiet
23;00:05:11,744;00:05:13,512;or I will.
24;00:05:13,546;00:05:15,097;Don't you
24;00:05:13,546;00:05:15,097;ever touch him.
25;00:05:17,083;00:05:19,417;Little wildling bitch.
26;00:05:19,435;00:05:22,471;You should have stayed
26;00:05:19,435;00:05:22,471;with your own kind.
27;00:05:24,474;00:05:26,274;You listening to me?
28;00:05:26,309;00:05:28,310;Shut your mouth.
28;00:05:26,309;00:05:28,310;What?
29;00:05:30,697;00:05:33,198;It's just an owl,
29;00:05:30,697;00:05:33,198;you dumb bitch.
30;00:05:33,232;00:05:35,484;No, it's not.
31;00:07:12,715;00:07:15,667;- Shh.
32;00:07:23,209;00:07:25,377;I should never
32;00:07:23,209;00:07:25,377;have left her there.
33;00:07:25,411;00:07:29,014;You couldn't have known.
33;00:07:25,411;00:07:29,014;Of course I could've known.
34;00:07:29,048;00:07:31,566;They've been raiding
34;00:07:29,048;00:07:31,566;the villages close by.
35;00:07:31,601;00:07:34,402;And we just cower in here while
35;00:07:31,601;00:07:34,402;they slaughter our brothers.
36;00:07:34,437;00:07:36,238;Our brothers had orders
36;00:07:34,437;00:07:36,238;to stay at Castle Black.
37;00:07:36,272;00:07:38,857;So it's all right, then?
37;00:07:36,272;00:07:38,857;Black Jack and Kegs
38;00:07:38,891;00:07:40,742;and Mully chopped to pieces
38;00:07:38,891;00:07:40,742;'cause they broke the rules?
39;00:07:40,776;00:07:42,277;I didn't say it
39;00:07:40,776;00:07:42,277;was all right.
40;00:07:42,328;00:07:43,995;I'm saying they shouldn't
40;00:07:42,328;00:07:43,995;have been there.
41;00:07:44,030;00:07:46,531;We're pledged to guard
41;00:07:44,030;00:07:46,531;the realms of men.
42;00:07:46,565;00:07:48,033;She's dead because of me.
43;00:07:48,067;00:07:49,584;We can't even guard
43;00:07:48,067;00:07:49,584;Mole's Town.
44;00:07:49,619;00:07:51,203;We can't go after them.
44;00:07:49,619;00:07:51,203;You know that.
45;00:07:51,254;00:07:52,704;It's what they want.
46;00:07:52,738;00:07:55,073;And little Sam.
47;00:07:55,091;00:07:58,093;As if I cut
47;00:07:55,091;00:07:58,093;their throats myself.
48;00:07:58,127;00:07:59,461;Maybe she managed
48;00:07:58,127;00:07:59,461;to hide herself.
49;00:07:59,512;00:08:01,412;I thought
49;00:07:59,512;00:08:01,412;all of you was dead.
50;00:08:01,430;00:08:03,715;You went north with Mormont
50;00:08:01,430;00:08:03,715;and no one came back.
51;00:08:03,749;00:08:05,800;Not for ages.
52;00:08:05,852;00:08:07,719;But then you did.
53;00:08:09,421;00:08:11,106;She survived Craster
54;00:08:11,140;00:08:13,692;and he was the worst
54;00:08:11,140;00:08:13,692;shit I've ever met.
55;00:08:13,726;00:08:15,393;She survived the long march
55;00:08:13,726;00:08:15,393;to the Wall.
56;00:08:15,427;00:08:19,231;She survived a white walker,
56;00:08:15,427;00:08:19,231;for fuck's sake.
57;00:08:20,599;00:08:21,950;She might have got out.
58;00:08:24,370;00:08:26,705;She might have.
59;00:08:28,040;00:08:30,408;If they hit Mole's Town,
60;00:08:30,442;00:08:32,494;then we're next.
61;00:08:35,498;00:08:37,499;Mance and his army
61;00:08:35,498;00:08:37,499;must be close.
62;00:08:37,550;00:08:39,217;100,000 of them.
63;00:08:39,252;00:08:41,753;And there's what,
63;00:08:39,252;00:08:41,753;105 of us left?
64;00:08:41,787;00:08:44,422;You counting Black Jack,
64;00:08:41,787;00:08:44,422;Kegs, and Mully?
65;00:08:46,309;00:08:47,592;102.
66;00:08:47,644;00:08:50,762;How do 102 men
66;00:08:47,644;00:08:50,762;stop 100,000?
67;00:08:54,483;00:08:57,302;Whoever dies last,
67;00:08:54,483;00:08:57,302;be a good lad
68;00:08:57,320;00:08:59,771;and burn the rest of us.
69;00:08:59,805;00:09:02,407;Once I'm done
69;00:08:59,805;00:09:02,407;with this world,
70;00:09:02,441;00:09:04,910;I don't want
70;00:09:02,441;00:09:04,910;to come back.
71;00:10:05,388;00:10:07,672;You think he was
71;00:10:05,388;00:10:07,672;spying on you?
72;00:10:07,706;00:10:09,307;No, not spying.
73;00:10:09,342;00:10:11,593;The Dothraki think
73;00:10:09,342;00:10:11,593;outsiders are ridiculous
74;00:10:11,644;00:10:13,094;taking shame
74;00:10:11,644;00:10:13,094;in the naked body.
75;00:10:13,145;00:10:16,481;They make love under the stars
75;00:10:13,145;00:10:16,481;for the whole khalasar to see.
76;00:10:18,017;00:10:20,185;Yes, Your Grace.
77;00:10:20,219;00:10:22,520;But you are not
77;00:10:20,219;00:10:22,520;Dothraki.
78;00:10:22,554;00:10:24,522;No.
79;00:10:26,025;00:10:27,859;Well, I don't see
79;00:10:26,025;00:10:27,859;why it matters.
80;00:10:27,910;00:10:29,160;Grey Worm
80;00:10:27,910;00:10:29,160;isn't interested.
81;00:10:29,195;00:10:31,663;None of the Unsullied care
81;00:10:29,195;00:10:31,663;what's under our clothes.
82;00:10:34,733;00:10:37,035;He was interested.
83;00:10:37,069;00:10:39,621;What?
84;00:10:40,923;00:10:44,125;I believe he was
84;00:10:40,923;00:10:44,125;interested.
85;00:10:45,928;00:10:48,013;When the slavers
85;00:10:45,928;00:10:48,013;castrate the boys,
86;00:10:48,098;00:10:49,764;do they take all of it?
87;00:10:49,799;00:10:51,883;All of it?
88;00:10:51,917;00:10:53,852;The--
89;00:10:53,886;00:10:56,638;the pillar
89;00:10:53,886;00:10:56,638;and the stones.
90;00:10:59,275;00:11:01,393;I don't know,
90;00:10:59,275;00:11:01,393;Your Grace.
91;00:11:01,427;00:11:04,145;Haven't you
91;00:11:01,427;00:11:04,145;ever wondered?
92;00:11:07,400;00:11:09,984;Yes, Your Grace.
93;00:11:27,336;00:11:29,337;Missandei.
94;00:11:45,337;00:11:47,806;The lessons you give I
94;00:11:45,337;00:11:47,806;in common tongue...
95;00:11:50,509;00:11:52,660;these are precious to I.
96;00:11:52,695;00:11:54,946;To me.
96;00:11:52,695;00:11:54,946;To me.
97;00:11:54,980;00:11:58,149;I don't remember teaching
97;00:11:54,980;00:11:58,149;you the word precious.
98;00:11:58,167;00:12:01,252;Jorah the Andal,
98;00:11:58,167;00:12:01,252;he teaches I--
99;00:12:01,287;00:12:04,089;he teaches me
99;00:12:01,287;00:12:04,089;this word.
100;00:12:05,458;00:12:07,792;Do you remember the name
100;00:12:05,458;00:12:07,792;you were given at birth?
101;00:12:07,826;00:12:10,628;I remember nothing.
102;00:12:10,662;00:12:12,514;Only Unsullied.
103;00:12:12,548;00:12:14,549;When they cut you,
104;00:12:14,600;00:12:17,018;do you remember that?
105;00:12:19,221;00:12:21,439;I'm sorry.
106;00:12:21,474;00:12:23,691;I'm sorry they did
106;00:12:21,474;00:12:23,691;that to you.
107;00:12:23,726;00:12:26,444;Why?
107;00:12:23,726;00:12:26,444;Why sorry?
108;00:12:26,479;00:12:29,147;It's a terrible thing
108;00:12:26,479;00:12:29,147;to do to a boy.
109;00:12:34,236;00:12:36,738;If the masters
109;00:12:34,236;00:12:36,738;never cut me,
110;00:12:36,789;00:12:38,873;I never am Unsullied.
111;00:12:38,908;00:12:42,043;I never stand in
111;00:12:38,908;00:12:42,043;the Plaza of Pride
112;00:12:42,077;00:12:44,662;when Daenerys Stormborn
112;00:12:42,077;00:12:44,662;orders us
113;00:12:44,696;00:12:46,581;to kill the masters.
114;00:12:46,632;00:12:50,401;I never am chosen
114;00:12:46,632;00:12:50,401;to lead the Unsullied.
115;00:12:50,436;00:12:52,703;I never meet Missandei
116;00:12:52,721;00:12:55,006;from the island of Naath.
117;00:13:11,524;00:13:13,992;I am sorry I--
118;00:13:15,194;00:13:17,529;for today.
119;00:13:17,563;00:13:19,697;I am sorry.
120;00:14:05,077;00:14:07,712;Kraken. Mmm.
121;00:14:07,746;00:14:10,381;Strong as long
121;00:14:07,746;00:14:10,381;as they're in the sea.
122;00:14:10,416;00:14:13,117;When you take them
122;00:14:10,416;00:14:13,117;out of the water,
123;00:14:13,135;00:14:14,452;no bones.
124;00:14:14,470;00:14:16,671;They collapse
124;00:14:14,470;00:14:16,671;under their proud weight
125;00:14:16,722;00:14:19,090;and slump into
125;00:14:16,722;00:14:19,090;a heap of nothing.
126;00:14:19,124;00:14:21,342;You'd think
126;00:14:19,124;00:14:21,342;they know that.
127;00:14:21,393;00:14:23,978;Unfortunately,
127;00:14:21,393;00:14:23,978;they're not very bright.
128;00:14:25,564;00:14:27,482;What do you tell them?
129;00:14:27,516;00:14:29,767;I'm Theon Greyjoy,
130;00:14:29,801;00:14:32,570;son of Balon,
130;00:14:29,801;00:14:32,570;heir to the Iron Islands.
131;00:14:32,605;00:14:35,806;And what are you really?
131;00:14:32,605;00:14:35,806;I'm Reek.
132;00:14:35,824;00:14:37,825;Are you sure?
133;00:14:39,245;00:14:41,746;You do look very much
133;00:14:39,245;00:14:41,746;like a lord.
134;00:14:41,780;00:14:45,033;Formidable, proud.
135;00:14:46,201;00:14:47,619;I'm Reek.
136;00:14:47,703;00:14:49,504;Until when?
137;00:14:49,538;00:14:51,589;Always.
138;00:14:51,624;00:14:53,841;Forever.
138;00:14:51,624;00:14:53,841;That's right.
139;00:14:53,876;00:14:57,262;Until you're rotting
139;00:14:53,876;00:14:57,262;in the ground.
140;00:14:59,998;00:15:03,885;Remember what you are
140;00:14:59,998;00:15:03,885;and what you're not.
141;00:15:03,936;00:15:06,354;Bring me Moat Cailin.
142;00:15:36,418;00:15:38,419;No closer.
143;00:15:40,872;00:15:43,091;Who are you?
144;00:16:21,347;00:16:23,715;I'm Kenning,
145;00:16:23,766;00:16:25,967;commander of
145;00:16:23,766;00:16:25,967;this garrison.
146;00:16:27,753;00:16:29,771;And you say
146;00:16:27,753;00:16:29,771;you're Theon Greyjoy?
147;00:16:29,805;00:16:31,723;Yes.
148;00:16:31,757;00:16:34,809;And why should
148;00:16:31,757;00:16:34,809;I believe that?
149;00:16:34,860;00:16:37,862;I was born on Pyke
149;00:16:34,860;00:16:37,862;to Balon Greyjoy.
150;00:16:37,896;00:16:40,615;His third
150;00:16:37,896;00:16:40,615;and last living son.
151;00:16:40,649;00:16:42,367;I am your prince.
152;00:16:42,401;00:16:44,619;I swear it
152;00:16:42,401;00:16:44,619;by the Drowned God.
153;00:16:44,653;00:16:46,988;What is dead
153;00:16:44,653;00:16:46,988;may never die.
154;00:16:47,039;00:16:49,073;What is dead
154;00:16:47,039;00:16:49,073;may never die.
155;00:16:49,107;00:16:51,376;And if you were
155;00:16:49,107;00:16:51,376;my prince,
156;00:16:51,410;00:16:53,711;why are you marching
156;00:16:51,410;00:16:53,711;with a Bolton army?
157;00:16:53,746;00:16:56,297;Lord Bolton took me
157;00:16:53,746;00:16:56,297;captive after Winterfell.
158;00:16:56,331;00:16:59,300;He sent me to treat
158;00:16:56,331;00:16:59,300;with you in good faith
159;00:16:59,334;00:17:00,752;as your fellow ironborn.
160;00:17:00,786;00:17:02,637;And what does
160;00:17:00,786;00:17:02,637;Lord Bolton want?
161;00:17:05,391;00:17:07,642;You are fading
161;00:17:05,391;00:17:07,642;from sickness,
162;00:17:07,676;00:17:09,143;you are badly outnumbered,
163;00:17:09,178;00:17:11,479;and you're hundreds
163;00:17:09,178;00:17:11,479;of miles from the sea.
164;00:17:11,513;00:17:13,431;Lord Bolton implores you
164;00:17:11,513;00:17:13,431;to protect your men
165;00:17:13,465;00:17:16,984;and abandon this fortress
165;00:17:13,465;00:17:16,984;you can no longer hold.
166;00:17:17,019;00:17:20,438;Do this, and he will be
166;00:17:17,019;00:17:20,438;just and fair with you
167;00:17:20,489;00:17:22,407;as he has been with me.
168;00:17:24,326;00:17:27,361;The Boltons will give you safe
168;00:17:24,326;00:17:27,361;passage to the Stony Shore.
169;00:17:27,413;00:17:29,614;He wants us
169;00:17:27,413;00:17:29,614;to surrender?
170;00:17:29,648;00:17:32,366;My own father,
170;00:17:29,648;00:17:32,366;your king,
171;00:17:32,418;00:17:35,703;surrendered years ago
171;00:17:32,418;00:17:35,703;to Robert Baratheon.
172;00:17:35,754;00:17:38,005;I watched him
172;00:17:35,754;00:17:38,005;bend the knee.
173;00:17:38,040;00:17:39,624;There was no shame there.
174;00:17:39,658;00:17:42,343;He fought with honor,
174;00:17:39,658;00:17:42,343;as did you.
175;00:17:46,381;00:17:48,683;No shame.
175;00:17:46,381;00:17:48,683;Fought with honor.
176;00:17:48,717;00:17:50,601;I'm sorry,
176;00:17:48,717;00:17:50,601;I didn't hear.
177;00:17:53,055;00:17:55,523;No shame.
177;00:17:53,055;00:17:55,523;Fought with honor.
178;00:17:58,894;00:18:01,813;Only a whipped dog
178;00:17:58,894;00:18:01,813;would speak this way.
179;00:18:04,116;00:18:05,566;Or a woman.
180;00:18:06,985;00:18:08,820;Are you a woman, boy?
181;00:18:08,854;00:18:10,321;You don't know--
182;00:18:10,355;00:18:12,657;The ironborn
182;00:18:10,355;00:18:12,657;will not surrender.
183;00:18:12,691;00:18:14,375;Reek. My name is Reek...
184;00:18:14,409;00:18:16,694;You go tell
184;00:18:14,409;00:18:16,694;your master that,
185;00:18:16,712;00:18:18,996;Theon Greyjoy,
186;00:18:19,030;00:18:21,031;or whoever the fuck
186;00:18:19,030;00:18:21,031;you are.
187;00:18:21,049;00:18:22,717;My name is Reek.
188;00:18:22,751;00:18:24,385;What in the hell
188;00:18:22,751;00:18:24,385;are you muttering?
189;00:18:24,419;00:18:26,304;I'm Reek.
190;00:18:27,589;00:18:29,223;Reek.
191;00:18:36,181;00:18:37,899;If we yield, we live?
192;00:18:37,933;00:18:39,901;Is that what it says
192;00:18:37,933;00:18:39,901;on this paper here?
193;00:18:39,935;00:18:44,221;Yes. Have your men raise the
193;00:18:39,935;00:18:44,221;white flag and open the gates.
194;00:18:44,239;00:18:46,657;You're going home.
195;00:18:53,499;00:18:55,900;- You didn't really think
195;00:18:53,499;00:18:55,900;- I'd let them go, did you?
196;00:18:55,918;00:18:59,670;It's fallen out
196;00:18:55,918;00:18:59,670;of fashion, flaying.
197;00:18:59,705;00:19:01,923;Sad, but true.
198;00:19:02,007;00:19:03,958;Traditions
198;00:19:02,007;00:19:03,958;are important.
199;00:19:04,009;00:19:06,294;Where are we
199;00:19:04,009;00:19:06,294;without our history?
200;00:19:06,345;00:19:08,796;Eh?
200;00:19:06,345;00:19:08,796;Yes, my lord.
201;00:19:08,847;00:19:11,382;Will we go home now?
202;00:19:12,751;00:19:14,552;I believe we will.
203;00:19:14,586;00:19:16,554;To our new home.
204;00:19:26,765;00:19:29,700;You have foreign blood,
204;00:19:26,765;00:19:29,700;don't you, Baelish?
205;00:19:29,735;00:19:33,237;A great-grandfather
205;00:19:29,735;00:19:33,237;from Braavos, yes.
206;00:19:33,271;00:19:35,823;I suppose
206;00:19:33,271;00:19:35,823;all of our ancestors
207;00:19:35,874;00:19:37,825;came from somewhere
207;00:19:35,874;00:19:37,825;else originally.
208;00:19:37,876;00:19:40,077;Our forebearers
208;00:19:37,876;00:19:40,077;settled the Vale
209;00:19:40,112;00:19:41,546;thousands of years ago.
210;00:19:41,580;00:19:44,081;We've fought off invaders
210;00:19:41,580;00:19:44,081;ever since.
211;00:19:44,115;00:19:45,616;The beauty of the Vale
211;00:19:44,115;00:19:45,616;is matched only
212;00:19:45,634;00:19:48,002;by the nobility
212;00:19:45,634;00:19:48,002;of its great families.
213;00:19:48,053;00:19:50,137;Lady Arryn often told me
214;00:19:50,172;00:19:52,790;that you were her rock,
214;00:19:50,172;00:19:52,790;Lord Royce.
215;00:19:52,808;00:19:55,610;She told me nothing
215;00:19:52,808;00:19:55,610;about you, Baelish.
216;00:19:55,644;00:19:58,379;But I didn't need
216;00:19:55,644;00:19:58,379;to hear from her.
217;00:19:58,413;00:20:00,548;Moneylender.
217;00:19:58,413;00:20:00,548;Whoremonger.
218;00:20:00,616;00:20:03,584;You've been licking Tywin
218;00:20:00,616;00:20:03,584;Lannister's boots so long,
219;00:20:03,619;00:20:05,570;It's a wonder your tongue's not black.
219;00:20:03,619;00:20:05,570;My lord--
220;00:20:05,604;00:20:09,407;And when Jon Arryn named you
220;00:20:05,604;00:20:09,407;Master of Coin, no one cared.
221;00:20:09,441;00:20:11,325;Always been a grubby job.
222;00:20:11,360;00:20:13,578;Why not let
222;00:20:11,360;00:20:13,578;a grubby man do it?
223;00:20:13,612;00:20:16,180;But when I heard
223;00:20:13,612;00:20:16,180;you were lurking here,
224;00:20:16,215;00:20:18,049;fawning over
224;00:20:16,215;00:20:18,049;the Lady Arryn--
225;00:20:18,083;00:20:20,167;Lady Arryn
225;00:20:18,083;00:20:20,167;invited me.
226;00:20:20,202;00:20:22,954;She and I have been
226;00:20:20,202;00:20:22,954;close since childhood.
227;00:20:22,988;00:20:25,539;Yes, we all know
227;00:20:22,988;00:20:25,539;how close you were.
228;00:20:25,591;00:20:28,392;Lady Arryn's predilections
228;00:20:25,591;00:20:28,392;were her own affair.
229;00:20:28,427;00:20:30,044;Her death is our affair.
230;00:20:30,095;00:20:32,847;Of course. Her suicide
230;00:20:30,095;00:20:32,847;shattered us all.
231;00:20:32,881;00:20:35,266;She was an odd fish.
232;00:20:35,300;00:20:38,019;Everyone knew that.
232;00:20:35,300;00:20:38,019;But suicide?
233;00:20:38,053;00:20:41,522;She adored
233;00:20:38,053;00:20:41,522;that boy of hers.
234;00:20:41,556;00:20:43,941;I don't see her abandoning him.
234;00:20:41,556;00:20:43,941;Not by choice.
235;00:20:43,976;00:20:47,111;Strange that within days
235;00:20:43,976;00:20:47,111;of your arrival,
236;00:20:47,145;00:20:51,482;you've married Lady Arryn and she's
236;00:20:47,145;00:20:51,482;fallen through the Moon Door.
237;00:20:51,516;00:20:53,567;She was always prone
237;00:20:51,516;00:20:53,567;to melancholy.
238;00:20:53,619;00:20:57,121;My lady wasn't meant for a
238;00:20:53,619;00:20:57,121;world as brutal as ours.
239;00:20:57,155;00:20:59,206;We were told there was a witness.
239;00:20:57,155;00:20:59,206;A girl.
240;00:20:59,241;00:21:01,575;A niece of yours,
240;00:20:59,241;00:21:01,575;I believe.
241;00:21:03,211;00:21:06,030;A girl with no learning
241;00:21:03,211;00:21:06,030;and scattered wits.
242;00:21:06,048;00:21:07,364;I assure you,
242;00:21:06,048;00:21:07,364;she would be of no help.
243;00:21:07,382;00:21:09,500;We'd like
243;00:21:07,382;00:21:09,500;to speak with her.
244;00:21:11,470;00:21:13,888;Let me fetch her.
244;00:21:11,470;00:21:13,888;- No need.
245;00:21:13,922;00:21:18,175;We prefer to hear her
245;00:21:13,922;00:21:18,175;testimony unadulterated.
246;00:21:28,103;00:21:29,770;Come closer, child.
247;00:21:29,821;00:21:33,223;You have nothing
247;00:21:29,821;00:21:33,223;to fear from us or him.
248;00:21:33,241;00:21:36,744;Lord Baelish here
248;00:21:33,241;00:21:36,744;is your uncle?
249;00:21:37,729;00:21:39,163;Your name is Alayne?
250;00:21:40,916;00:21:44,068;Perhaps you would feel more comfortable
250;00:21:40,916;00:21:44,068;if Lord Baelish left the room.
251;00:21:44,086;00:21:45,870;My lady--
251;00:21:44,086;00:21:45,870;I wasn't asking you.
252;00:21:45,904;00:21:49,090;He can stay. - Speak up, girl,
252;00:21:45,904;00:21:49,090;you're not a damn kitchen mouse.
253;00:21:49,124;00:21:51,208;Tell us what you saw.
254;00:21:54,212;00:21:56,597;I'm sorry, Lord Baelish.
255;00:21:56,631;00:21:58,516;I have to tell the truth.
256;00:22:03,472;00:22:05,473;I'll tell you
256;00:22:03,472;00:22:05,473;everything.
257;00:22:05,524;00:22:09,944;Please, Alayne,
257;00:22:05,524;00:22:09,944;leave nothing out.
258;00:22:11,646;00:22:14,065;My name is not Alayne.
259;00:22:14,099;00:22:16,567;It's Sansa Stark,
260;00:22:16,601;00:22:19,236;eldest daughter
260;00:22:16,601;00:22:19,236;of Lord Eddard Stark.
261;00:22:19,270;00:22:21,939;Lord Royce, we met when
261;00:22:19,270;00:22:21,939;you came to Winterfell.
262;00:22:21,957;00:22:24,775;You were escorting your son
262;00:22:21,957;00:22:24,775;Ser Waymar to the Wall.
263;00:22:24,793;00:22:27,995;Sansa Stark?
264;00:22:28,046;00:22:31,248;You tell lies right to my
264;00:22:28,046;00:22:31,248;face, you little worm?
265;00:22:31,282;00:22:34,468;Lord Baelish
265;00:22:31,282;00:22:34,468;has told many lies.
266;00:22:36,888;00:22:39,256;All to protect me.
267;00:22:40,392;00:22:42,560;Since my father
267;00:22:40,392;00:22:42,560;was executed,
268;00:22:42,594;00:22:45,479;I have been a hostage
268;00:22:42,594;00:22:45,479;in King's Landing.
269;00:22:45,514;00:22:48,315;A plaything for Joffrey
269;00:22:45,514;00:22:48,315;to torture
270;00:22:48,350;00:22:50,518;or Queen Cersei
270;00:22:48,350;00:22:50,518;to torment.
271;00:22:50,569;00:22:53,187;They beat me,
271;00:22:50,569;00:22:53,187;they humiliated me,
272;00:22:53,238;00:22:56,107;they married me
272;00:22:53,238;00:22:56,107;to the Imp.
273;00:22:56,141;00:22:58,993;I had no friends
273;00:22:56,141;00:22:58,993;in King's Landing...
274;00:23:01,279;00:23:02,863;except one.
275;00:23:08,537;00:23:11,122;He saved me.
276;00:23:11,173;00:23:14,542;Smuggled me away
276;00:23:11,173;00:23:14,542;when he had the chance.
277;00:23:15,844;00:23:18,512;He knew I'd be safe
277;00:23:15,844;00:23:18,512;here in the Eyrie
278;00:23:18,547;00:23:21,182;with my own blood,
278;00:23:18,547;00:23:21,182;my Aunt Lysa.
279;00:23:22,884;00:23:25,770;The Lannisters have
279;00:23:22,884;00:23:25,770;friends everywhere.
280;00:23:25,804;00:23:27,054;Even the Vale.
281;00:23:27,105;00:23:30,307;He made me swear not to
281;00:23:27,105;00:23:30,307;tell anyone my true name.
282;00:23:30,341;00:23:33,144;Your secret is safe
282;00:23:30,341;00:23:33,144;with us, my lady.
283;00:23:33,178;00:23:35,780;Your father grew up
283;00:23:33,178;00:23:35,780;right here in these halls.
284;00:23:35,814;00:23:38,015;We hunted together
284;00:23:35,814;00:23:38,015;many times.
285;00:23:38,033;00:23:39,483;He was a fine man.
286;00:23:39,568;00:23:44,205;Tell us what happened
286;00:23:39,568;00:23:44,205;to your aunt, Sansa.
287;00:23:46,158;00:23:49,210;You knew her well,
287;00:23:46,158;00:23:49,210;my lords, my lady.
288;00:23:49,244;00:23:51,579;You knew she was
288;00:23:49,244;00:23:51,579;a troubled woman.
289;00:23:51,630;00:23:54,415;She always loved
289;00:23:51,630;00:23:54,415;Lord Baelish.
290;00:23:54,466;00:23:56,200;She told me herself.
291;00:23:56,218;00:23:58,719;From the moment he arrived
291;00:23:56,218;00:23:58,719;at the gates of Riverrun,
292;00:23:58,753;00:24:03,474;a boy of eight carrying everything
292;00:23:58,753;00:24:03,474;he owned in a little sack.
293;00:24:03,508;00:24:07,978;She confessed to me
293;00:24:03,508;00:24:07,978;she never loved Lord Arryn.
294;00:24:08,013;00:24:11,499;She did as her father commanded,
294;00:24:08,013;00:24:11,499;as so many of us have.
295;00:24:11,533;00:24:15,552;When the gods finally allowed
295;00:24:11,533;00:24:15,552;her to be with Lord Baelish,
296;00:24:15,570;00:24:17,238;she was so happy.
297;00:24:17,272;00:24:18,722;For a time.
298;00:24:19,891;00:24:22,860;My aunt
298;00:24:19,891;00:24:22,860;was a jealous lady.
299;00:24:24,246;00:24:27,665;She was terrified
299;00:24:24,246;00:24:27,665;that Lord Baelish
300;00:24:27,699;00:24:28,949;didn't love her
300;00:24:27,699;00:24:28,949;anymore.
301;00:24:29,000;00:24:31,535;That he would abandon
301;00:24:29,000;00:24:31,535;her for a younger woman.
302;00:24:34,956;00:24:37,007;And then...
303;00:24:37,042;00:24:40,377;one day she saw
303;00:24:37,042;00:24:40,377;him kiss me.
304;00:24:40,411;00:24:42,046;Lady Sansa.
305;00:24:42,097;00:24:45,216;It was a peck on the cheek,
305;00:24:42,097;00:24:45,216;Lord Royce, nothing more.
306;00:24:45,250;00:24:48,886;Lord Baelish is my uncle
306;00:24:45,250;00:24:48,886;now, in truth, by marriage.
307;00:24:48,920;00:24:51,889;He's always been
307;00:24:48,920;00:24:51,889;so kind to me.
308;00:24:51,923;00:24:54,775;I was so happy to be here,
308;00:24:51,923;00:24:54,775;to be free.
309;00:24:54,809;00:24:56,944;All because of him.
310;00:24:56,978;00:24:59,230;But my aunt
310;00:24:56,978;00:24:59,230;turned on me.
311;00:24:59,264;00:25:02,616;She cursed me.
311;00:24:59,264;00:25:02,616;Called me a whore.
312;00:25:02,651;00:25:05,369;Promised to throw me
312;00:25:02,651;00:25:05,369;through the Moon Door.
313;00:25:05,403;00:25:07,821;When Lord Baelish tried
313;00:25:05,403;00:25:07,821;to calm her,
314;00:25:07,873;00:25:09,707;she struck him.
315;00:25:09,741;00:25:11,441;She said she didn't want
315;00:25:09,741;00:25:11,441;to live anymore.
316;00:25:11,459;00:25:13,577;She stood on the edge
316;00:25:11,459;00:25:13,577;of that Moon Door.
317;00:25:13,611;00:25:15,379;He tried
317;00:25:13,611;00:25:15,379;to reason with her.
318;00:25:15,413;00:25:17,915;Promised her she was the
318;00:25:15,413;00:25:17,915;only one he had ever loved,
319;00:25:17,949;00:25:22,586;but she stepped through
319;00:25:17,949;00:25:22,586;those doors and she was--
320;00:25:24,956;00:25:26,957;Shh.
321;00:25:26,975;00:25:30,811;Shh, it's not your fault,
321;00:25:26,975;00:25:30,811;sweet girl.
322;00:25:35,100;00:25:38,402;It's not
322;00:25:35,100;00:25:38,402;your fault.
323;00:25:53,585;00:25:55,953;You could see it in the
323;00:25:53,585;00:25:55,953;way she raised that boy.
324;00:25:56,037;00:25:58,956;Feeding him from her own teats
324;00:25:56,037;00:25:58,956;when he was 10 years old.
325;00:25:58,990;00:26:02,042;Lord Royce!
325;00:25:58,990;00:26:02,042;This is hardly the time.
326;00:26:02,093;00:26:03,794;Apologies, my lady.
327;00:26:03,845;00:26:05,662;And to you
327;00:26:03,845;00:26:05,662;as well, Baelish.
328;00:26:05,680;00:26:07,548;We treated you
328;00:26:05,680;00:26:07,548;a bit harshly.
329;00:26:07,599;00:26:09,383;You want justice,
329;00:26:07,599;00:26:09,383;Lord Royce.
330;00:26:09,434;00:26:10,935;I can hardly
330;00:26:09,434;00:26:10,935;complain about that.
331;00:26:10,969;00:26:12,770;I want the same.
332;00:26:12,804;00:26:17,441;Not much justice to be meted
332;00:26:12,804;00:26:17,441;out in suicide, is there?
333;00:26:17,475;00:26:19,777;For Lysa, no.
333;00:26:17,475;00:26:19,777;But for her son?
334;00:26:19,811;00:26:21,946;Only 20 years ago,
334;00:26:19,811;00:26:21,946;the knights of the Vale
335;00:26:21,980;00:26:25,232;rode behind Jon Arryn,
335;00:26:21,980;00:26:25,232;Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon.
336;00:26:25,283;00:26:28,953;They fought together
336;00:26:25,283;00:26:28,953;to overcome the Mad King.
337;00:26:28,987;00:26:30,821;And since then,
337;00:26:28,987;00:26:30,821;Arryn and Royce,
338;00:26:30,872;00:26:32,489;Corbray, Waynwood,
339;00:26:32,523;00:26:35,709;all the great houses of the
339;00:26:32,523;00:26:35,709;Vale watched from the corner.
340;00:26:35,744;00:26:37,544;A timid boy
340;00:26:35,744;00:26:37,544;at a tavern brawl.
341;00:26:37,579;00:26:40,080;Are you questioning
341;00:26:37,579;00:26:40,080;our courage?
342;00:26:40,131;00:26:43,033;I want to know
342;00:26:40,131;00:26:43,033;which side you're on.
343;00:26:43,051;00:26:44,551;Do you support
343;00:26:43,051;00:26:44,551;the Lannisters,
344;00:26:44,586;00:26:46,670;the house that executed
344;00:26:44,586;00:26:46,670;your friend Ned Stark?
345;00:26:46,721;00:26:49,006;Of course we don't support
345;00:26:46,721;00:26:49,006;the damn Lannisters.
346;00:26:49,040;00:26:52,977;No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister
346;00:26:49,040;00:26:52,977;for support and Lysa refused.
347;00:26:53,011;00:26:55,980;By staying out of the fray,
347;00:26:53,011;00:26:55,980;you've allowed Tywin Lannister
348;00:26:56,014;00:26:58,548;to destroy his rivals
348;00:26:56,014;00:26:58,548;on every compass point.
349;00:26:58,566;00:27:00,017;Who stands
349;00:26:58,566;00:27:00,017;against him now?
350;00:27:00,051;00:27:02,719;Who would you have
350;00:27:00,051;00:27:02,719;us back, Lord Baelish?
351;00:27:02,737;00:27:04,488;Robb Stark is dead.
352;00:27:04,522;00:27:07,107;I'd have you back
352;00:27:04,522;00:27:07,107;Robin Arryn,
353;00:27:07,158;00:27:08,826;Lord of the Vale.
354;00:27:08,860;00:27:10,828;Robin Arryn is
354;00:27:08,860;00:27:10,828;a sickly little boy.
355;00:27:10,862;00:27:14,281;And sickly little boys
355;00:27:10,862;00:27:14,281;sometimes become powerful men.
356;00:27:14,332;00:27:16,367;More often
356;00:27:14,332;00:27:16,367;they die young.
357;00:27:16,418;00:27:18,952;I adored Lysa
357;00:27:16,418;00:27:18,952;with all my heart.
358;00:27:19,004;00:27:22,923;But she loved her son so much,
358;00:27:19,004;00:27:22,923;she became overprotective.
359;00:27:22,957;00:27:25,709;He needs to learn
359;00:27:22,957;00:27:25,709;how to swing a sword.
360;00:27:25,743;00:27:27,094;How to ride a horse.
361;00:27:27,128;00:27:29,963;Aye, it's time.
361;00:27:27,128;00:27:29,963;Yes, it's time.
362;00:27:30,015;00:27:31,882;Time for him
362;00:27:30,015;00:27:31,882;to tour the Vale,
363;00:27:31,916;00:27:34,385;to visit all the castles
363;00:27:31,916;00:27:34,385;in his domain.
364;00:27:34,436;00:27:37,805;Time for Robin
364;00:27:34,436;00:27:37,805;to leave the nest.
365;00:27:57,275;00:27:59,543;Ser Barristan.
366;00:27:59,577;00:28:01,412;Yes?
367;00:28:02,714;00:28:04,465;Who sent you?
368;00:28:40,251;00:28:42,369;Ser Barristan.
368;00:28:40,251;00:28:42,369;Ser Jorah.
369;00:28:42,420;00:28:45,205;Have I forgotten
369;00:28:42,420;00:28:45,205;a council meeting?
370;00:28:45,256;00:28:47,508;No.
371;00:28:56,134;00:28:58,051;What's this?
372;00:28:58,103;00:28:59,603;A royal pardon
373;00:28:59,637;00:29:02,222;signed by
373;00:28:59,637;00:29:02,222;Robert Baratheon.
374;00:29:15,787;00:29:18,038;You spied on her.
375;00:29:20,291;00:29:21,575;Who gave you this?
376;00:29:21,626;00:29:23,994;Does it matter?
377;00:29:32,804;00:29:34,221;Have you told her?
378;00:29:34,255;00:29:36,557;I wanted to tell you
378;00:29:34,255;00:29:36,557;first, man-to-man
379;00:29:36,591;00:29:39,560;rather than go
379;00:29:36,591;00:29:39,560;behind your back.
380;00:29:42,981;00:29:44,848;Let me speak
380;00:29:42,981;00:29:44,848;with her in private.
381;00:29:44,882;00:29:47,184;You'll never be alone
381;00:29:44,882;00:29:47,184;with her again.
382;00:30:23,638;00:30:26,473;Why did the usurper
382;00:30:23,638;00:30:26,473;pardon you?
383;00:30:29,194;00:30:31,144;If we could
383;00:30:29,194;00:30:31,144;speak alone.
384;00:30:31,196;00:30:33,597;No, speak to me here.
385;00:30:33,615;00:30:36,116;Explain it to me.
386;00:30:36,150;00:30:38,268;Who do you think
386;00:30:36,150;00:30:38,268;sent this to Meereen?
387;00:30:38,286;00:30:40,103;Who profits?
388;00:30:40,121;00:30:42,272;This is the work
388;00:30:40,121;00:30:42,272;of Tywin Lannister.
389;00:30:42,290;00:30:44,107;He wants to divide us.
390;00:30:44,125;00:30:46,793;If we're fighting each other,
390;00:30:44,125;00:30:46,793;we're not fighting him.
391;00:30:46,828;00:30:49,796;The pardon was signed
391;00:30:46,828;00:30:49,796;the year we met.
392;00:30:51,616;00:30:53,217;Why were you pardoned?
393;00:30:53,251;00:30:55,586;Unless you're saying
393;00:30:53,251;00:30:55,586;this document was forged.
394;00:30:58,139;00:31:00,007;It is not forged.
395;00:31:00,091;00:31:02,059;Why, then?
396;00:31:02,093;00:31:03,810;I sent letters to Varys,
397;00:31:03,845;00:31:06,063;the spymaster
397;00:31:03,845;00:31:06,063;of King's Landing.
398;00:31:06,097;00:31:08,515;What was the content
398;00:31:06,097;00:31:08,515;of these letters?
399;00:31:08,566;00:31:10,968;Information.
399;00:31:08,566;00:31:10,968;What information?
400;00:31:11,002;00:31:13,937;When you and Viserys
400;00:31:11,002;00:31:13,937;arrived in Pentos.
401;00:31:13,971;00:31:16,440;His plan to marry you
401;00:31:13,971;00:31:16,440;to Khal Drogo.
402;00:31:16,474;00:31:18,742;When you were married.
403;00:31:18,776;00:31:20,494;When your brother died.
404;00:31:20,528;00:31:22,996;You told him I was
404;00:31:20,528;00:31:22,996;carrying Drogo's child?
405;00:31:23,081;00:31:24,648;I--
405;00:31:23,081;00:31:24,648;Yes or no?
406;00:31:24,666;00:31:25,982;Khaleesi.
406;00:31:24,666;00:31:25,982;Don't call me that.
407;00:31:26,000;00:31:29,286;Did you tell him I was
407;00:31:26,000;00:31:29,286;carrying Drogo's child?
408;00:31:31,623;00:31:33,457;Yes.
409;00:31:36,160;00:31:38,295;That wine merchant
409;00:31:36,160;00:31:38,295;tried to poison me
410;00:31:38,329;00:31:39,880;because of
410;00:31:38,329;00:31:39,880;your information.
411;00:31:39,931;00:31:41,715;I stopped you
411;00:31:39,931;00:31:41,715;from drinking his wine.
412;00:31:41,766;00:31:43,684;Because you knew
412;00:31:41,766;00:31:43,684;it was poisoned.
413;00:31:43,718;00:31:46,053;I suspected.
414;00:31:46,104;00:31:48,472;You betrayed me
415;00:31:48,523;00:31:50,691;from the first.
416;00:31:50,725;00:31:53,560;Forgive me.
417;00:31:53,611;00:31:55,812;I never meant--
418;00:31:55,846;00:31:58,148;please, Khaleesi,
418;00:31:55,846;00:31:58,148;forgive me.
419;00:31:58,182;00:32:00,867;You sold my secrets to
419;00:31:58,182;00:32:00,867;the man who killed my father
420;00:32:00,902;00:32:02,869;and stole my brother's throne...
420;00:32:00,902;00:32:02,869;I have protected you.
421;00:32:02,904;00:32:04,288;Fought for you.
421;00:32:02,904;00:32:04,288;Killed for you.
422;00:32:04,322;00:32:05,872;...and you want me
422;00:32:04,322;00:32:05,872;to forgive you?
423;00:32:08,025;00:32:09,859;I have loved you.
424;00:32:09,877;00:32:11,828;Love?
425;00:32:11,862;00:32:14,665;Love? How can you
425;00:32:11,862;00:32:14,665;say that to me?
426;00:32:14,699;00:32:17,701;Any other man, and I
426;00:32:14,699;00:32:17,701;would have you executed.
427;00:32:17,719;00:32:20,971;But you, I do not want you
427;00:32:17,719;00:32:20,971;in my city dead or alive.
428;00:32:21,005;00:32:24,391;Go back to your masters
428;00:32:21,005;00:32:24,391;in King's Landing.
429;00:32:24,425;00:32:26,977;Collect your pardon
429;00:32:24,425;00:32:26,977;if you can.
430;00:32:30,348;00:32:31,715;Daenerys, please.
431;00:32:31,733;00:32:35,268;Don't ever presume
431;00:32:31,733;00:32:35,268;to touch me again
432;00:32:35,320;00:32:36,720;or speak my name.
433;00:32:36,738;00:32:38,488;You have until dusk
433;00:32:36,738;00:32:38,488;to collect your things
434;00:32:38,523;00:32:39,889;and leave this city.
435;00:32:39,907;00:32:42,859;If you're found in Meereen
435;00:32:39,907;00:32:42,859;past break of day,
436;00:32:42,893;00:32:45,529;I'll have your head
436;00:32:42,893;00:32:45,529;thrown into Slaver's Bay.
437;00:32:48,032;00:32:49,700;Go.
438;00:32:51,402;00:32:53,103;Now.
439;00:33:48,259;00:33:51,144;Moat Cailin
439;00:33:48,259;00:33:51,144;is yours, Father.
440;00:33:57,819;00:34:00,270;Walk with me.
441;00:34:00,321;00:34:01,855;Has there been
441;00:34:00,321;00:34:01,855;any word from Locke?
442;00:34:01,906;00:34:03,990;No.
443;00:34:04,026;00:34:05,308;Unimportant.
444;00:34:05,326;00:34:07,327;A cripple,
444;00:34:05,326;00:34:07,327;a young boy.
445;00:34:07,361;00:34:10,414;None of the northern
445;00:34:07,361;00:34:10,414;lords have seen them.
446;00:34:10,448;00:34:13,417;Dead most likely.
447;00:34:15,420;00:34:18,154;Most of the ironborn
447;00:34:15,420;00:34:18,154;have fled the North.
448;00:34:18,172;00:34:22,125;Now more will follow,
448;00:34:18,172;00:34:22,125;thanks to you.
449;00:34:24,545;00:34:26,797;Tell me what you see.
450;00:34:29,300;00:34:33,837;Moors, fields, hills.
451;00:34:33,855;00:34:36,807;Tell me what you see.
452;00:34:41,062;00:34:43,230;Nothing.
453;00:34:43,281;00:34:44,815;Not nothing.
454;00:34:44,849;00:34:47,234;The North.
455;00:34:47,285;00:34:50,036;Ride 700 miles that way,
455;00:34:47,285;00:34:50,036;you're still in the North.
456;00:34:50,071;00:34:52,906;400 miles that way.
457;00:34:52,957;00:34:54,991;300 miles that way.
458;00:34:55,025;00:34:58,912;The North is larger than the
458;00:34:55,025;00:34:58,912;other six kingdoms combined.
459;00:34:58,963;00:35:00,797;And I am the Warden
459;00:34:58,963;00:35:00,797;of the North.
460;00:35:00,832;00:35:03,333;The North is mine.
461;00:35:05,136;00:35:07,587;Now tell me,
461;00:35:05,136;00:35:07,587;what is your name?
462;00:35:11,175;00:35:13,543;Ramsay Snow.
463;00:35:13,561;00:35:15,679;No, not Ramsay Snow.
464;00:35:16,898;00:35:18,682;Open it.
465;00:35:19,851;00:35:21,852;From this day
465;00:35:19,851;00:35:21,852;until your last day,
466;00:35:21,886;00:35:23,570;you are Ramsay Bolton,
467;00:35:23,604;00:35:26,523;son of Roose Bolton,
467;00:35:23,604;00:35:26,523;Warden of the North.
468;00:35:32,780;00:35:34,915;You honor me.
469;00:35:34,949;00:35:37,951;I swear I will
469;00:35:34,949;00:35:37,951;uphold your name
470;00:35:38,002;00:35:39,953;and your tradition.
471;00:35:40,004;00:35:42,372;I will be worthy
471;00:35:40,004;00:35:42,372;of you, Father,
472;00:35:42,406;00:35:44,791;I promise.
473;00:36:03,093;00:36:06,897;Come, Reek,
473;00:36:03,093;00:36:06,897;I'll be needing a bath.
474;00:36:35,676;00:36:37,510;Yes?
475;00:36:50,741;00:36:53,343;First time I saw you,
475;00:36:50,741;00:36:53,343;you were just a child.
476;00:36:53,377;00:36:56,646;A girl from the North come to
476;00:36:53,377;00:36:56,646;the capital for the first time.
477;00:36:56,681;00:36:59,382;Not a child any longer.
478;00:37:02,787;00:37:04,888;Why did you help me?
479;00:37:04,922;00:37:07,290;They would have thrown you
479;00:37:04,922;00:37:07,290;through the Moon Door
480;00:37:07,325;00:37:08,992;if they found
480;00:37:07,325;00:37:08,992;you guilty.
481;00:37:09,010;00:37:11,544;That's not an answer.
482;00:37:14,565;00:37:16,299;If they'd have
482;00:37:14,565;00:37:16,299;executed you,
483;00:37:16,333;00:37:17,801;what would they
483;00:37:16,333;00:37:17,801;have done with me?
484;00:37:18,803;00:37:21,170;I don't know.
485;00:37:21,188;00:37:23,640;Neither do I.
486;00:37:24,842;00:37:26,843;Better to gamble
486;00:37:24,842;00:37:26,843;on the man you know
487;00:37:26,861;00:37:28,612;than the strangers
487;00:37:26,861;00:37:28,612;you don't?
488;00:37:30,615;00:37:32,649;And you think
488;00:37:30,615;00:37:32,649;you know me?
489;00:37:34,285;00:37:36,036;I know what you want.
490;00:37:36,070;00:37:37,954;Do you?
491;00:37:53,554;00:37:55,088;I thought
491;00:37:53,554;00:37:55,088;it'd make me happy,
492;00:37:55,139;00:37:57,090;but it doesn't.
492;00:37:55,139;00:37:57,090;Not really.
493;00:37:57,141;00:37:59,175;Nothing makes
493;00:37:57,141;00:37:59,175;you happy.
494;00:37:59,226;00:38:00,844;Lots of things make me happy.
494;00:37:59,226;00:38:00,844;Like what?
495;00:38:00,878;00:38:02,896;Killing Polliver,
495;00:38:00,878;00:38:02,896;killing Rorge.
496;00:38:02,930;00:38:06,149;So you're sad because you didn't
496;00:38:02,930;00:38:06,149;get to kill Joffrey yourself.
497;00:38:06,183;00:38:07,434;Is that it?
498;00:38:07,485;00:38:09,052;At least I could
498;00:38:07,485;00:38:09,052;have been there to watch.
499;00:38:09,070;00:38:12,072;I wanted to see the look in his
499;00:38:09,070;00:38:12,072;eyes when he knew it was over.
500;00:38:12,106;00:38:15,492;Aye, nothing in the world
500;00:38:12,106;00:38:15,492;beats that look.
501;00:38:15,526;00:38:18,061;You protected him
501;00:38:15,526;00:38:18,061;for most of his life.
502;00:38:18,079;00:38:19,446;You think you
502;00:38:18,079;00:38:19,446;could have saved him?
503;00:38:19,497;00:38:22,515;I wasn't the damn
503;00:38:19,497;00:38:22,515;wine taster.
504;00:38:24,618;00:38:28,838;Little shit deserved
504;00:38:24,618;00:38:28,838;to die, but poison--
505;00:38:28,873;00:38:31,708;poison's a woman's weapon.
506;00:38:31,742;00:38:33,593;Men kill with steel.
507;00:38:33,627;00:38:35,095;That's your stupid
507;00:38:33,627;00:38:35,095;pride talking.
508;00:38:35,129;00:38:37,464;It's why you'll never
508;00:38:35,129;00:38:37,464;be a great killer.
509;00:38:37,515;00:38:40,300;I'd have killed Joffrey with
509;00:38:37,515;00:38:40,300;a chicken bone if I had to.
510;00:38:41,802;00:38:44,854;I'd pay good money
510;00:38:41,802;00:38:44,854;to see that.
511;00:38:47,525;00:38:50,610;You should have
511;00:38:47,525;00:38:50,610;let me burn it.
512;00:38:50,695;00:38:53,146;It's a fleabite.
513;00:38:53,197;00:38:56,616;That fleabite's got you walking
513;00:38:53,197;00:38:56,616;a lot slower than you used to.
514;00:38:56,701;00:38:59,953;Well, we won't have to
514;00:38:56,701;00:38:59,953;walk too much further.
515;00:38:59,987;00:39:01,905;You really think my
515;00:38:59,987;00:39:01,905;aunt will pay for me?
516;00:39:01,956;00:39:03,540;Aye, she'll pay.
517;00:39:03,574;00:39:04,941;I've never even
517;00:39:03,574;00:39:04,941;met her.
518;00:39:04,959;00:39:08,378;Doesn't matter.
518;00:39:04,959;00:39:08,378;You're her blood.
519;00:39:09,580;00:39:12,999;Family, honor,
519;00:39:09,580;00:39:12,999;all that horseshit.
520;00:39:13,050;00:39:15,618;It's all you lords
520;00:39:13,050;00:39:15,618;and ladies ever talk about.
521;00:39:15,636;00:39:17,804;I'm not a lady.
522;00:39:19,306;00:39:21,091;Who would pass
522;00:39:19,306;00:39:21,091;the Bloody Gate?
523;00:39:21,125;00:39:24,460;The bloody Hound,
523;00:39:21,125;00:39:24,460;Sandor Clegane.
524;00:39:24,478;00:39:26,763;And his...
525;00:39:26,797;00:39:29,799;traveling companion
525;00:39:26,797;00:39:29,799;Arya Stark,
526;00:39:29,817;00:39:32,802;niece of your lady
526;00:39:29,817;00:39:32,802;Lysa Arryn.
527;00:39:32,820;00:39:35,688;Then I offer
527;00:39:32,820;00:39:35,688;my condolences.
528;00:39:35,740;00:39:38,024;Lady Arryn died.
529;00:39:41,362;00:39:43,279;Three days ago.
530;00:40:01,331;00:40:03,466;I've never left home
530;00:40:01,331;00:40:03,466;before, Uncle Petyr.
531;00:40:03,500;00:40:05,635;I'm afraid to leave.
531;00:40:03,500;00:40:05,635;You shouldn't be.
532;00:40:05,669;00:40:08,721;The Lord of the Vale belongs
532;00:40:05,669;00:40:08,721;in the Eyrie, Mother said.
533;00:40:08,773;00:40:11,274;She said it's not
533;00:40:08,773;00:40:11,274;safe outside.
534;00:40:11,308;00:40:13,026;It wasn't safe
534;00:40:11,308;00:40:13,026;for her inside.
535;00:40:13,060;00:40:16,846;People die
535;00:40:13,060;00:40:16,846;at their dinner tables.
536;00:40:16,864;00:40:18,982;They die in their beds.
537;00:40:19,016;00:40:22,402;They die squatting
537;00:40:19,016;00:40:22,402;over their chamber pots.
538;00:40:22,453;00:40:24,821;Everybody dies
538;00:40:22,453;00:40:24,821;sooner or later.
539;00:40:24,872;00:40:26,706;Don't worry
539;00:40:24,872;00:40:26,706;about your death.
540;00:40:26,740;00:40:29,459;Worry about your life.
541;00:40:29,493;00:40:31,878;Take charge of your life
542;00:40:31,912;00:40:34,363;for as long as it lasts.
543;00:40:34,381;00:40:37,333;That is what it means
543;00:40:34,381;00:40:37,333;to be Lord of the Vale.
544;00:41:01,391;00:41:03,359;Shall we go?
545;00:41:10,751;00:41:13,036;Wine always helps.
546;00:41:14,705;00:41:17,173;I thank you
546;00:41:14,705;00:41:17,173;for it.
547;00:41:18,676;00:41:20,543;Trial by combat.
548;00:41:21,929;00:41:25,014;Deciding a man's guilt
548;00:41:21,929;00:41:25,014;or innocence
549;00:41:25,049;00:41:27,217;in the eyes of the gods
550;00:41:27,268;00:41:29,886;by having two other men
550;00:41:27,268;00:41:29,886;hack each other to pieces.
551;00:41:29,920;00:41:32,689;Tells you something
551;00:41:29,920;00:41:32,689;about the gods.
552;00:41:35,059;00:41:36,759;How much longer?
553;00:41:36,777;00:41:39,095;Soon.
554;00:41:42,116;00:41:44,267;Do you think
554;00:41:42,116;00:41:44,267;Oberyn has a chance?
555;00:41:47,121;00:41:49,272;The Red Viper of Dorne.
556;00:41:49,290;00:41:51,491;You don't get a name like that
556;00:41:49,290;00:41:51,491;unless you're deadly, right?
557;00:41:51,542;00:41:52,909;I've never
557;00:41:51,542;00:41:52,909;seen him fight.
558;00:41:52,993;00:41:55,712;Oh, he's going to die.
558;00:41:52,993;00:41:55,712;I'm going to die.
559;00:41:55,746;00:41:57,046;Oberyn believes in himself.
560;00:41:57,081;00:41:59,132;That's putting it mildly.
561;00:42:00,384;00:42:02,335;What's the punishment
561;00:42:00,384;00:42:02,335;for regicide?
562;00:42:02,386;00:42:05,171;Drawing and quartering?
562;00:42:02,386;00:42:05,171;Hanging?
563;00:42:05,222;00:42:07,557;Breaking at the wheel?
563;00:42:05,222;00:42:07,557;Beheading.
564;00:42:07,591;00:42:09,325;Seems rather
564;00:42:07,591;00:42:09,325;ordinary.
565;00:42:09,360;00:42:11,861;And he was my nephew
565;00:42:09,360;00:42:11,861;as well, so what is that?
566;00:42:11,896;00:42:13,429;Fratricide is brothers.
567;00:42:13,463;00:42:15,598;Filicide is sons.
568;00:42:16,650;00:42:19,185;Nepoticide.
568;00:42:16,650;00:42:19,185;That's the one.
569;00:42:21,822;00:42:24,324;Matricide, patricide,
570;00:42:24,358;00:42:27,243;infanticide, suicide.
571;00:42:28,779;00:42:31,197;There's no kind of killing that
571;00:42:28,779;00:42:31,197;doesn't have its own word.
572;00:42:31,248;00:42:33,116;Cousins.
573;00:42:33,150;00:42:35,218;Cousins, you're right.
574;00:42:35,252;00:42:36,986;There is no word
574;00:42:35,252;00:42:36,986;for cousin killing.
575;00:42:37,004;00:42:38,821;Well done.
576;00:42:38,839;00:42:41,874;Do you remember cousin Orson?
576;00:42:38,839;00:42:41,874;Orson Lannister?
577;00:42:41,926;00:42:44,210;Of course. Wet-nurse
577;00:42:41,926;00:42:44,210;dropped him on his head.
578;00:42:44,261;00:42:46,846;Left him simple.
578;00:42:44,261;00:42:46,846;Simple?
579;00:42:46,880;00:42:48,932;Used to sit all day
579;00:42:46,880;00:42:48,932;in the garden.
580;00:42:48,966;00:42:50,717;Crushing beetles
580;00:42:48,966;00:42:50,717;with a rock.
581;00:42:54,471;00:42:56,639;Nothing made him happier.
582;00:42:56,690;00:42:58,024;Nothing made you happier.
583;00:42:58,058;00:42:59,943;You'd think being
583;00:42:58,058;00:42:59,943;tormented from birth
584;00:42:59,977;00:43:02,145;would have given you some
584;00:42:59,977;00:43:02,145;affinity for the afflicted.
585;00:43:02,179;00:43:05,365;On the contrary. Laughing
585;00:43:02,179;00:43:05,365;at another person's misery
586;00:43:05,399;00:43:07,367;was the only thing that made
586;00:43:05,399;00:43:07,367;me feel like everyone else.
587;00:43:07,401;00:43:09,285;The joke wore thin, though.
588;00:43:09,320;00:43:11,204;For you.
588;00:43:09,320;00:43:11,204;You drifted away.
589;00:43:11,238;00:43:12,905;I had other interests.
590;00:43:12,957;00:43:14,958;Yes, other interests.
591;00:43:17,161;00:43:18,861;But I stayed with Orson.
592;00:43:18,879;00:43:20,830;Why?
593;00:43:20,864;00:43:22,298;I was curious.
594;00:43:22,333;00:43:24,700;Why was he smashing
594;00:43:22,333;00:43:24,700;all those beetles?
595;00:43:24,718;00:43:26,269;What did he
595;00:43:24,718;00:43:26,269;get out of it?
596;00:43:26,303;00:43:28,388;First thing I did
596;00:43:26,303;00:43:28,388;was ask him.
597;00:43:28,422;00:43:32,175;Orson, why are you smashing
597;00:43:28,422;00:43:32,175;all those beetles?
598;00:43:32,209;00:43:35,228;He gave me an answer.
598;00:43:32,209;00:43:35,228;Smash the beetles.
599;00:43:35,262;00:43:38,181;Smash 'em.
600;00:43:39,316;00:43:40,984;I wasn't deterred.
601;00:43:41,018;00:43:42,718;I was the smartest
601;00:43:41,018;00:43:42,718;person I knew.
602;00:43:42,736;00:43:45,271;Certainly I had the wherewithal
602;00:43:42,736;00:43:45,271;to unravel the mysteries
603;00:43:45,322;00:43:46,990;that lay at the heart
603;00:43:45,322;00:43:46,990;of a moron.
604;00:43:47,024;00:43:50,576;So I went to
604;00:43:47,024;00:43:50,576;Maester Volarik's library.
605;00:43:50,611;00:43:52,779;Volarik.
605;00:43:50,611;00:43:52,779;Tried to touch me once.
606;00:43:52,830;00:43:55,331;Turns out, far too much has
606;00:43:52,830;00:43:55,331;been written about great men
607;00:43:55,366;00:43:57,533;and not nearly enough
607;00:43:55,366;00:43:57,533;about morons.
608;00:43:57,567;00:43:59,869;Doesn't seem right.
609;00:43:59,903;00:44:01,838;In any case,
609;00:43:59,903;00:44:01,838;I found nothing
610;00:44:01,872;00:44:03,873;that illuminated the nature
610;00:44:01,872;00:44:03,873;of Orson's affliction
611;00:44:03,907;00:44:06,709;or the reason behind his
611;00:44:03,907;00:44:06,709;relentless beetle slaughter.
612;00:44:06,743;00:44:09,078;So I went back
612;00:44:06,743;00:44:09,078;to the source.
613;00:44:09,113;00:44:11,280;I may not have been able
613;00:44:09,113;00:44:11,280;to speak with Orson,
614;00:44:11,315;00:44:13,933;but I could observe him,
614;00:44:11,315;00:44:13,933;watch him
615;00:44:13,967;00:44:16,219;the way men
615;00:44:13,967;00:44:16,219;watch animals
616;00:44:16,253;00:44:19,105;to come to a deeper understanding
616;00:44:16,253;00:44:19,105;of their behavior.
617;00:44:21,942;00:44:23,309;And as I watched,
618;00:44:23,360;00:44:25,862;I became more and more
618;00:44:23,360;00:44:25,862;sure of it.
619;00:44:25,896;00:44:28,531;There was something
619;00:44:25,896;00:44:28,531;happening there.
620;00:44:28,565;00:44:31,784;His face was like
620;00:44:28,565;00:44:31,784;the page of a book
621;00:44:31,819;00:44:33,769;written in a language
621;00:44:31,819;00:44:33,769;I didn't understand.
622;00:44:33,787;00:44:36,622;But he wasn't mindless.
622;00:44:33,787;00:44:36,622;He had his reasons.
623;00:44:36,657;00:44:39,942;And I became possessed
623;00:44:36,657;00:44:39,942;with knowing what they were.
624;00:44:39,960;00:44:43,496;I began to spend inordinate
624;00:44:39,960;00:44:43,496;amounts of time watching him.
625;00:44:43,547;00:44:46,165;I would eat my lunch
625;00:44:43,547;00:44:46,165;in the garden,
626;00:44:46,216;00:44:48,301;chewing my mutton
626;00:44:46,216;00:44:48,301;to the music of...
627;00:44:50,054;00:44:52,922;And when I wasn't watching
627;00:44:50,054;00:44:52,922;him, I was thinking about him.
628;00:44:52,956;00:44:55,725;Father droned on about
628;00:44:52,956;00:44:55,725;the family legacy
629;00:44:55,759;00:44:57,493;and I thought about
629;00:44:55,759;00:44:57,493;Orson's beetles.
630;00:44:57,528;00:45:00,396;I read the histories
630;00:44:57,528;00:45:00,396;of Targaryen conquests.
631;00:45:00,431;00:45:02,598;Did I hear dragon wings?
631;00:45:00,431;00:45:02,598;No.
632;00:45:02,650;00:45:05,601;I heard...
633;00:45:05,652;00:45:09,405;And I still couldn't figure
633;00:45:05,652;00:45:09,405;out why he was doing it.
634;00:45:09,440;00:45:11,741;And I had to know,
634;00:45:09,440;00:45:11,741;because it was horrible
635;00:45:11,775;00:45:15,144;that all these beetles should
635;00:45:11,775;00:45:15,144;be dying for no reason.
636;00:45:15,162;00:45:16,696;Every day around the world,
637;00:45:16,747;00:45:20,149;men, women, and children
637;00:45:16,747;00:45:20,149;are murdered by the score.
638;00:45:20,167;00:45:22,985;Who gives a dusty fuck
638;00:45:20,167;00:45:22,985;about a bunch of beetles?
639;00:45:23,003;00:45:25,821;I know, I know. But still,
639;00:45:23,003;00:45:25,821;it filled me with dread.
640;00:45:25,839;00:45:29,375;Piles and piles of them,
640;00:45:25,839;00:45:29,375;years and years of them.
641;00:45:29,426;00:45:31,260;How many countless living
641;00:45:29,426;00:45:31,260;crawling things
642;00:45:31,295;00:45:34,263;smashed and dried out
642;00:45:31,295;00:45:34,263;and returned to the dirt?
643;00:45:34,298;00:45:36,682;In my dreams I found myself
644;00:45:36,717;00:45:39,185;standing on a beach
644;00:45:36,717;00:45:39,185;made of beetle husks
645;00:45:39,219;00:45:41,270;stretching as far
645;00:45:39,219;00:45:41,270;as the eye could see.
646;00:45:41,305;00:45:43,473;I woke up crying,
647;00:45:43,507;00:45:45,858;weeping for their
647;00:45:43,507;00:45:45,858;shattered little bodies.
648;00:45:45,893;00:45:48,227;I tried to stop
648;00:45:45,893;00:45:48,227;Orson once.
649;00:45:48,278;00:45:49,645;He was twice your size.
650;00:45:49,696;00:45:51,447;He just pushed me
650;00:45:49,696;00:45:51,447;aside with a kuuh
651;00:45:51,482;00:45:54,033;and kept on smashing.
652;00:45:54,067;00:45:56,569;Every day until
652;00:45:54,067;00:45:56,569;that mule
653;00:45:56,620;00:45:58,621;kicked him in the chest
653;00:45:56,620;00:45:58,621;and killed him.
654;00:46:09,416;00:46:11,867;So what do you think?
655;00:46:11,885;00:46:14,337;Why did he do it?
656;00:46:14,371;00:46:16,672;What was it all about?
657;00:46:20,360;00:46:22,478;I don't know.
658;00:46:41,031;00:46:42,915;Good luck today.
659;00:47:15,449;00:47:17,433;Looks like
659;00:47:15,449;00:47:17,433;very light armor.
660;00:47:17,451;00:47:18,818;I like to move around.
661;00:47:18,869;00:47:20,736;You could at least
661;00:47:18,869;00:47:20,736;wear a helmet.
662;00:47:22,873;00:47:24,574;You shouldn't drink
662;00:47:22,873;00:47:24,574;before a fight.
663;00:47:24,608;00:47:26,792;You learn this during your
663;00:47:24,608;00:47:26,792;years in the fighting pits?
664;00:47:26,827;00:47:29,128;I always drink
664;00:47:26,827;00:47:29,128;before a fight.
665;00:47:29,162;00:47:31,614;It could get you killed.
665;00:47:29,162;00:47:31,614;It could get me killed.
666;00:47:31,632;00:47:34,584;Today is not
666;00:47:31,632;00:47:34,584;the day I die.
667;00:47:42,059;00:47:43,643;You're going
667;00:47:42,059;00:47:43,643;to fight that?
668;00:47:43,677;00:47:46,229;I'm going
668;00:47:43,677;00:47:46,229;to kill that.
669;00:47:50,567;00:47:52,268;He is the biggest man
669;00:47:50,567;00:47:52,268;I've ever seen.
670;00:47:52,302;00:47:55,021;Size does not matter when
670;00:47:52,302;00:47:55,021;you are flat on your back.
671;00:47:55,105;00:47:56,355;Thank the gods.
672;00:47:58,909;00:48:02,044;In the sight of gods
672;00:47:58,909;00:48:02,044;and men,
673;00:48:02,079;00:48:04,280;we gather to ascertain
674;00:48:04,314;00:48:07,083;the guilt or innocence
674;00:48:04,314;00:48:07,083;of this...
675;00:48:08,702;00:48:11,254;man Tyrion Lannister.
676;00:48:11,288;00:48:13,456;May the Mother grant
676;00:48:11,288;00:48:13,456;them mercy.
677;00:48:13,490;00:48:17,660;May the Father give them
677;00:48:13,490;00:48:17,660;such justice as they deserve.
678;00:48:17,678;00:48:20,379;And may the Warrior
678;00:48:17,678;00:48:20,379;guide the hand...
679;00:48:20,430;00:48:23,549;- ...of our champion--
680;00:48:31,441;00:48:33,693;Don't leave me
680;00:48:31,441;00:48:33,693;alone in this world.
681;00:48:33,727;00:48:35,645;Never.
682;00:48:56,049;00:48:57,750;Have they told you
682;00:48:56,049;00:48:57,750;who I am?
683;00:48:57,801;00:48:59,468;Some dead man.
684;00:49:04,424;00:49:07,176;I am the brother
684;00:49:04,424;00:49:07,176;of Elia Martell.
685;00:49:07,210;00:49:10,262;Do you know why I have come
685;00:49:07,210;00:49:10,262;all the way to this stinking
686;00:49:10,314;00:49:12,548;shit-pile of a city?
687;00:49:12,566;00:49:14,400;For you.
688;00:49:18,905;00:49:21,890;I'm going to hear you
688;00:49:18,905;00:49:21,890;confess before you die.
689;00:49:21,908;00:49:23,909;You raped my sister.
690;00:49:23,944;00:49:25,361;You murdered her.
691;00:49:25,395;00:49:27,163;You killed her children.
692;00:49:27,197;00:49:29,915;Say it now and we can
692;00:49:27,197;00:49:29,915;make this quick.
693;00:49:38,008;00:49:41,043;Say it.
693;00:49:38,008;00:49:41,043;You raped her.

695;00:49:47,551;00:49:48,934;You killed her children.
696;00:50:00,530;00:50:01,781;You raped her!

702;00:51:06,797;00:51:09,181;Wait.
702;00:51:06,797;00:51:09,181;Are you dying?
703;00:51:09,216;00:51:10,966;No, no, no.
704;00:51:11,000;00:51:14,053;You can't die yet.
704;00:51:11,000;00:51:14,053;You haven't confessed.
705;00:51:16,306;00:51:18,808;Say it.
706;00:51:18,842;00:51:22,528;Say her name.

709;00:51:27,451;00:51:29,118;Who gave you the order?
710;00:51:30,036;00:51:31,704;Who gave you
710;00:51:30,036;00:51:31,704;the order?!
711;00:51:31,738;00:51:34,039;Say her name!
712;00:51:34,074;00:51:36,158;You raped her!

718;00:51:57,063;00:51:59,515;Then I raped her.
719;00:51:59,549;00:52:02,685;Then I smashed her head

720;00:52:16,232;00:52:18,501;The gods have made
