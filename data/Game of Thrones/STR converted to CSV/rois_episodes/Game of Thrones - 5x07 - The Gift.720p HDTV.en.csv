2;00:02:58,671;00:03:00,805;First Ranger, you have
2;00:02:58,671;00:03:00,805;command of Castle Black.
3;00:03:01,173;00:03:03,422;Lord Commander,
3;00:03:01,173;00:03:03,422;it is my duty to tell you
4;00:03:03,542;00:03:06,645;I believe this mission
4;00:03:03,542;00:03:06,645;to be reckless, foolhardy,
5;00:03:06,946;00:03:08,647;and an insult
5;00:03:06,946;00:03:08,647;to all the brothers
6;00:03:08,948;00:03:11,650;who have died
6;00:03:08,948;00:03:11,650;fighting the wildlings.
7;00:03:11,951;00:03:14,718;As always, thank you
7;00:03:11,951;00:03:14,718;for your honesty.
8;00:03:21,593;00:03:22,960;Safe travels, Lord Commander.
9;00:03:23,195;00:03:25,429;Thank you, Sam.
10;00:03:25,597;00:03:27,265;Oh, um...
11;00:03:32,937;00:03:34,337;It's dragonglass.
12;00:03:34,706;00:03:36,473;It's what I used
12;00:03:34,706;00:03:36,473;to kill the white walker.
13;00:03:41,980;00:03:43,881;I hope you don't need them.
14;00:03:44,082;00:03:46,115;Me, too.
15;00:04:01,332;00:04:02,498;Yah.
16;00:04:19,449;00:04:21,149;There he is.
17;00:04:25,255;00:04:27,389;That laugh.
18;00:04:27,591;00:04:29,692;Egg.
19;00:04:29,959;00:04:32,127;Egg laughed like that.
20;00:04:32,462;00:04:35,496;One of the first things
20;00:04:32,462;00:04:35,496;I remember.
21;00:04:38,868;00:04:42,537;His little brother Aegon.
21;00:04:38,868;00:04:42,537;He became king.
22;00:04:44,373;00:04:48,476;And before that,
22;00:04:44,373;00:04:48,476;he was a jolly fellow,
23;00:04:48,677;00:04:50,378;like this one.
24;00:04:55,150;00:04:59,019;Get him south, Gillyflower.
25;00:05:00,356;00:05:02,890;Before it's too late.
26;00:05:53,841;00:05:55,241;Theon, wait.
27;00:05:55,509;00:05:57,576;Not Theon, my lady.
27;00:05:55,509;00:05:57,576;Reek.
28;00:05:57,744;00:05:59,512;Help me.
29;00:06:01,014;00:06:03,382;You're his wife now.
30;00:06:03,550;00:06:05,584;Theon.
31;00:06:05,786;00:06:07,019;Do what he says.
32;00:06:07,287;00:06:08,608;Do what he says
32;00:06:07,287;00:06:08,608;or he'll hurt you.
33;00:06:08,755;00:06:11,357;He already hurts me every night.
34;00:06:11,625;00:06:12,865;All day I'm locked in this room
35;00:06:13,126;00:06:14,926;and every night he comes...
36;00:06:17,730;00:06:19,063;It can't be any worse.
37;00:06:19,365;00:06:22,934;It can.
37;00:06:19,365;00:06:22,934;It can always be worse.
38;00:06:32,410;00:06:33,731;What did he do to you?
38;00:06:32,410;00:06:33,731;Please.
39;00:06:33,946;00:06:36,480;You betrayed my family!
39;00:06:33,946;00:06:36,480;I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
40;00:06:36,781;00:06:38,883;You have to help me.
40;00:06:36,781;00:06:38,883;Theon, help me.
41;00:06:39,218;00:06:42,353;He'll see us.
41;00:06:39,218;00:06:42,353;You don't know him.
42;00:06:42,721;00:06:43,888;My family still has
42;00:06:42,721;00:06:43,888;friends in the North.
43;00:06:44,289;00:06:47,191;All I need to do is give a
43;00:06:44,289;00:06:47,191;signal and they'll rescue me.
44;00:06:47,492;00:06:49,693;Climb to the top
44;00:06:47,492;00:06:49,693;of the broken tower.
45;00:06:50,061;00:06:51,741;Light this candle
45;00:06:50,061;00:06:51,741;and put it in the window.
46;00:06:52,063;00:06:54,297;Promise me, Theon.
46;00:06:52,063;00:06:54,297;Reek! My name is Reek.
47;00:06:57,268;00:07:00,070;Your name is Theon Greyjoy.
48;00:07:01,639;00:07:03,574;Last surviving son
48;00:07:01,639;00:07:03,574;of Balon Greyjoy,
49;00:07:03,808;00:07:04,975;Lord of the Iron Islands.
50;00:07:05,176;00:07:06,576;Do you hear me?
51;00:07:09,847;00:07:11,414;Theon...
52;00:07:13,017;00:07:14,351;promise me.
53;00:08:17,980;00:08:19,713;Yes, Reek?
54;00:08:35,497;00:08:37,531;Egg.
55;00:08:37,699;00:08:39,934;Egg.
56;00:08:42,203;00:08:44,504;Mother's looking for you.
57;00:08:46,007;00:08:47,941;Egg.
58;00:08:49,877;00:08:52,512;Get some sleep, Sam.
59;00:08:52,847;00:08:54,881;You'll have to speak
59;00:08:52,847;00:08:54,881;for him tomorrow.
60;00:08:56,717;00:08:57,985;You don't know that.
61;00:08:58,219;00:09:00,553;Get some sleep.
62;00:09:00,788;00:09:03,222;I'll watch over him.
63;00:09:05,693;00:09:08,060;I'm staying, too.
64;00:09:08,362;00:09:10,062;He's always been good to me.
65;00:09:10,297;00:09:12,064;I can't leave him now.
66;00:09:13,100;00:09:15,368;Egg!
67;00:09:26,613;00:09:28,614;Egg.
68;00:09:29,949;00:09:32,284;I dreamed...
69;00:09:32,486;00:09:34,486;that I was old.
70;00:09:45,899;00:09:48,133;His name
70;00:09:45,899;00:09:48,133;was Aemon Targaryen.
71;00:09:49,668;00:09:51,403;He came to us
71;00:09:49,668;00:09:51,403;from King's Landing.
72;00:09:54,006;00:09:56,908;A maester of the Citadel,
72;00:09:54,006;00:09:56,908;chained and sworn,
73;00:09:57,343;00:10:00,311;and sworn brother of the
73;00:09:57,343;00:10:00,311;Night's Watch, ever faithful.
74;00:10:01,747;00:10:03,581;No man was wiser
75;00:10:03,815;00:10:06,851;or gentler or kinder.
76;00:10:08,787;00:10:11,422;At the Wall,
76;00:10:08,787;00:10:11,422;a dozen lord commanders
77;00:10:11,757;00:10:13,858;came and went during
77;00:10:11,757;00:10:13,858;his years of service,
78;00:10:14,159;00:10:16,193;but he was always there
78;00:10:14,159;00:10:16,193;to counsel them.
79;00:10:19,665;00:10:21,198;He was the blood
79;00:10:19,665;00:10:21,198;of the dragon...
80;00:10:23,501;00:10:25,602;but now his fire has gone out.
81;00:10:28,339;00:10:29,906;And now his watch is ended.
82;00:10:30,208;00:10:32,609;And now his watch is ended.
83;00:11:01,338;00:11:03,639;You're losing
83;00:11:01,338;00:11:03,639;all your friends, Tarly.
84;00:11:41,210;00:11:42,844;My beautiful wife.
85;00:11:49,018;00:11:50,579;When my father told me
85;00:11:49,018;00:11:50,579;we were marrying,
86;00:11:50,719;00:11:53,755;I half expected
86;00:11:50,719;00:11:53,755;a fat, bearded beast.
87;00:11:58,694;00:12:01,362;Do you know how pleased
87;00:11:58,694;00:12:01,362;I was when I saw you?
88;00:12:01,630;00:12:03,797;You've made me very happy.
89;00:12:08,803;00:12:11,772;Our scouts report that Stannis
89;00:12:08,803;00:12:11,772;Baratheon rides for Winterfell.
90;00:12:12,040;00:12:14,542;He's a respected commander.
91;00:12:14,876;00:12:18,045;His troops are loyal
91;00:12:14,876;00:12:18,045;and battle-tested.
92;00:12:18,479;00:12:22,115;He's hired thousands of foreign
92;00:12:18,479;00:12:22,115;sellswords to bolster his army.
93;00:12:22,483;00:12:25,285;But this storm is a stroke
93;00:12:22,483;00:12:25,285;of luck for us northerners.
94;00:12:27,321;00:12:30,090;Our people are used
94;00:12:27,321;00:12:30,090;to fighting in the frost.
95;00:12:31,959;00:12:35,094;His army is out there now
95;00:12:31,959;00:12:35,094;suffering in the snow.
96;00:12:36,830;00:12:38,298;One day I'll be
96;00:12:36,830;00:12:38,298;Lord of Winterfell
97;00:12:38,566;00:12:40,567;and Warden of the North.
98;00:12:40,834;00:12:42,935;You'll be my lady and Wardeness.
99;00:12:46,407;00:12:48,241;But isn't
99;00:12:46,407;00:12:48,241;your stepmother pregnant?
100;00:12:48,442;00:12:51,210;What of it?
101;00:12:51,477;00:12:53,179;What happens if she has a boy?
102;00:12:54,948;00:12:56,448;Then I'll have a baby brother.
103;00:12:56,683;00:12:58,050;But he'll be the heir.
104;00:12:58,318;00:13:00,319;I'm Lord Bolton's eldest son.
105;00:13:00,587;00:13:01,854;But you're a bastard.
106;00:13:02,189;00:13:04,857;A trueborn will always
106;00:13:02,189;00:13:04,857;have the stronger claim.
107;00:13:08,094;00:13:10,429;I've been naturalized
107;00:13:08,094;00:13:10,429;by a royal decree from...
108;00:13:10,697;00:13:13,665;Tommen Baratheon?
108;00:13:10,697;00:13:13,665;Another bastard.
109;00:13:20,707;00:13:23,575;Bastards can rise
109;00:13:20,707;00:13:23,575;high in the world.
110;00:13:23,876;00:13:26,644;Like your half-brother
110;00:13:23,876;00:13:26,644;Jon Snow.
111;00:13:27,679;00:13:30,615;Born the bastard of Winterfell,
112;00:13:30,983;00:13:33,618;now the Lord Commander
112;00:13:30,983;00:13:33,618;of the Night's Watch.
113;00:13:35,654;00:13:37,822;You didn't know?
114;00:13:38,157;00:13:40,991;Yes, he's done
114;00:13:38,157;00:13:40,991;very well for himself.
115;00:13:41,159;00:13:42,760;Oh.
116;00:13:43,128;00:13:45,363;I nearly forgot why
116;00:13:43,128;00:13:45,363;I asked you to join me.
117;00:13:45,564;00:13:46,997;Come, my lady.
118;00:13:58,676;00:14:00,244;Your northern friend.
119;00:14:03,681;00:14:05,949;Reek told me
119;00:14:03,681;00:14:05,949;you wanted to leave.
120;00:14:06,084;00:14:07,517;Why?
121;00:14:07,752;00:14:09,153;Winterfell is your home
122;00:14:09,387;00:14:11,755;and I am your husband.
123;00:14:11,990;00:14:13,657;Tough old bird.
124;00:14:13,991;00:14:16,092;Everyone talks
124;00:14:13,991;00:14:16,092;when I start peeling them.
125;00:14:16,327;00:14:18,495;But this one,
126;00:14:18,862;00:14:21,331;her heart gave out before
126;00:14:18,862;00:14:21,331;I even got to her face.
127;00:14:23,834;00:14:26,736;We do breed them tough
127;00:14:23,834;00:14:26,736;in the North.
128;00:14:33,010;00:14:35,477;Bring my wife
128;00:14:33,010;00:14:35,477;back to her chamber.
129;00:14:35,779;00:14:37,880;It's far too cold
129;00:14:35,779;00:14:37,880;out here for a lady.
130;00:14:38,182;00:14:40,950;You should hold on
130;00:14:38,182;00:14:40,950;to your candles.
131;00:14:41,218;00:14:44,053;The nights are so long now.
132;00:15:34,002;00:15:36,270;40 horses
132;00:15:34,002;00:15:36,270;died in the night.
133;00:15:36,571;00:15:39,106;We'll lose more come sunset.
134;00:15:39,407;00:15:40,674;We're running out of food.
135;00:15:41,076;00:15:43,443;We can't open the supply
135;00:15:41,076;00:15:43,443;line until the snow clears.
136;00:15:48,783;00:15:49,783;What else?
137;00:15:50,018;00:15:52,986;The Stormcrows
137;00:15:50,018;00:15:52,986;rode off last night.
138;00:15:56,357;00:15:57,924;500 men.
139;00:16:01,161;00:16:03,196;Sellswords.
140;00:16:03,464;00:16:05,632;Loyal to nothing but gold.
141;00:16:09,603;00:16:11,871;We still have a hard
141;00:16:09,603;00:16:11,871;march to Winterfell
142;00:16:12,273;00:16:13,306;and we won't be marching
142;00:16:12,273;00:16:13,306;anywhere in this weather.
143;00:16:13,473;00:16:15,108;And?
144;00:16:15,342;00:16:16,675;This isn't our time.
145;00:16:17,111;00:16:20,246;We should head back to Castle
145;00:16:17,111;00:16:20,246;Black when the snow clears.
146;00:16:20,614;00:16:22,782;I retreated from
146;00:16:20,614;00:16:22,782;King's Landing, Ser Davos.
147;00:16:23,150;00:16:26,251;If I retreat again,
147;00:16:23,150;00:16:26,251;I'll become the King Who Ran.
148;00:16:26,553;00:16:28,353;Your Grace...
148;00:16:26,553;00:16:28,353;Winter is coming.
149;00:16:28,722;00:16:31,390;Those aren't just the Stark words.
149;00:16:28,722;00:16:31,390;It's a fact.
150;00:16:31,691;00:16:34,393;If we march
150;00:16:31,691;00:16:34,393;back to Castle Black,
151;00:16:34,661;00:16:36,695;we winter at Castle Black.
152;00:16:36,996;00:16:38,697;And who can say how many years
153;00:16:38,965;00:16:40,466;this winter will last?
154;00:16:40,867;00:16:42,600;It's better to wait for the right
154;00:16:40,867;00:16:42,600;time than risk everything.
155;00:16:42,969;00:16:44,929;This is the right time
155;00:16:42,969;00:16:44,929;and I will risk everything.
156;00:16:45,171;00:16:48,206;Because if I don't, we've lost.
157;00:16:48,408;00:16:50,342;We march to victory
158;00:16:50,576;00:16:54,246;or we march to defeat.
159;00:16:54,547;00:16:56,848;But we go forward.
159;00:16:54,547;00:16:56,848;Only forward.
160;00:17:06,826;00:17:08,526;Your Grace.
161;00:17:13,365;00:17:15,599;I've trusted in your visions
162;00:17:15,900;00:17:18,735;and your prophecies for years.
163;00:17:19,004;00:17:21,505;You saw it yourself, my king,
164;00:17:21,773;00:17:23,441;when you stared into the flames.
165;00:17:23,741;00:17:24,875;A great battle in the snow.
166;00:17:25,210;00:17:27,111;I don't know what I saw.
166;00:17:25,210;00:17:27,111;You do know.
167;00:17:27,346;00:17:28,346;Trust yourself.
168;00:17:28,613;00:17:30,514;And you?
168;00:17:28,613;00:17:30,514;Do you trust yourself?
169;00:17:30,748;00:17:33,016;I trust in the Lord.
170;00:17:35,520;00:17:37,788;Are you sure?
171;00:17:43,561;00:17:46,797;I have seen myself walk along
171;00:17:43,561;00:17:46,797;the battlements of Winterfell.
172;00:17:47,231;00:17:51,801;I have seen the flayed man
172;00:17:47,231;00:17:51,801;banners lowered to the ground.
173;00:18:00,611;00:18:04,047;But sometimes sacrifices must
173;00:18:00,611;00:18:04,047;be made to ensure victory.
174;00:18:06,249;00:18:09,485;I have shown you
174;00:18:06,249;00:18:09,485;the power of king's blood.
175;00:18:09,753;00:18:10,820;The usurper Robb Stark.
176;00:18:11,121;00:18:13,222;The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
177;00:18:13,557;00:18:15,625;We don't have
177;00:18:13,557;00:18:15,625;Robert's bastard here.
178;00:18:15,926;00:18:19,261;No, we have someone better.
179;00:18:21,097;00:18:23,132;And your blood
179;00:18:21,097;00:18:23,132;runs through her veins.
180;00:18:24,967;00:18:26,735;Have you lost your mind?
181;00:18:26,936;00:18:28,370;Do you doubt me?
182;00:18:28,571;00:18:30,906;Still?
183;00:18:31,174;00:18:32,741;After all that you've seen.
184;00:18:33,009;00:18:34,476;There must be another way.
185;00:18:34,777;00:18:37,079;Leeches or...
185;00:18:34,777;00:18:37,079;There is only one way.
186;00:18:37,447;00:18:41,049;You must become king
186;00:18:37,447;00:18:41,049;before the Long Night begins.
187;00:18:41,417;00:18:43,218;Only you can lead
187;00:18:41,417;00:18:43,218;the living against the dead.
188;00:18:43,485;00:18:46,621;All your life has led us
188;00:18:43,485;00:18:46,621;to this moment.
189;00:18:46,956;00:18:49,024;To this decision.
189;00:18:46,956;00:18:49,024;She's my daughter.
190;00:18:51,460;00:18:53,494;Get out.
191;00:19:15,784;00:19:17,184;There's always
191;00:19:15,784;00:19:17,184;some sort of grub on.
192;00:19:17,485;00:19:19,386;A bit of mutton would be nice.
193;00:19:23,058;00:19:26,927;A beauty from beyond the Wall.
194;00:19:27,361;00:19:29,881;Where you going, love? Aren't we
194;00:19:27,361;00:19:29,881;better-looking than the fat man?
195;00:19:29,897;00:19:32,665;No, the question is is she pretty
195;00:19:29,897;00:19:32,665;down south in the real world
196;00:19:33,033;00:19:34,953;or is she pretty 'cause
196;00:19:33,033;00:19:34,953;she's the only girl here?
197;00:19:34,969;00:19:36,636;Even in White Harbor,
197;00:19:34,969;00:19:36,636;I'd want a kiss.
198;00:19:36,904;00:19:39,672;Come on, love, give us a kiss.
199;00:19:40,174;00:19:42,576;Leave me alone. - Oh, if you were my girl,
199;00:19:40,174;00:19:42,576;I wouldn't leave you alone.
200;00:19:42,910;00:19:44,110;One little kiss.
200;00:19:42,910;00:19:44,110;Come on, give him a kiss.
201;00:19:44,411;00:19:46,479;A man gets lonely
201;00:19:44,411;00:19:46,479;guarding the Wall.
202;00:19:51,184;00:19:52,384;There's no need to be rude.
203;00:19:52,685;00:19:54,453;We just want a little affection.
204;00:19:54,687;00:19:57,156;Ooh.
205;00:19:58,658;00:20:00,459;Get your hands off her.
206;00:20:00,727;00:20:03,194;Brother Derek, Brother Brant,
207;00:20:03,529;00:20:05,363;I believe you both
207;00:20:03,529;00:20:05,363;have guard duty tonight.
208;00:20:05,564;00:20:06,965;Sam the Slayer.
209;00:20:07,266;00:20:08,587;You gonna slay me
209;00:20:07,266;00:20:08,587;with that sword?
210;00:20:08,835;00:20:10,002;Look at his hand shake.
211;00:20:10,202;00:20:12,037;Gilly, go on.
212;00:20:12,371;00:20:14,272;Get back to your room,
212;00:20:12,371;00:20:14,272;lock the door.
213;00:20:17,776;00:20:19,377;I'm warning you.
213;00:20:17,776;00:20:19,377;Come on.
214;00:20:19,545;00:20:21,212;Come on.
215;00:20:24,883;00:20:26,451;Sam!
216;00:20:26,718;00:20:29,020;You lying sack of shit.
217;00:20:29,355;00:20:30,821;Killed a white walker, eh?
218;00:20:31,123;00:20:33,324;You fat-ass fuck.
219;00:20:33,559;00:20:35,025;Come on, get up.
220;00:20:35,393;00:20:37,761;- No!
220;00:20:35,393;00:20:37,761;This your hero? This hog?
221;00:20:37,962;00:20:40,864;Leave him alone!
222;00:20:41,232;00:20:43,400;Stubborn little wildling
222;00:20:41,232;00:20:43,400;bitch, aren't you?
223;00:20:45,570;00:20:47,604;Come on!
223;00:20:45,570;00:20:47,604;No!
224;00:20:47,872;00:20:50,641;Sam! Sam! Sam!
224;00:20:47,872;00:20:50,641;Come on!
225;00:20:59,784;00:21:01,885;Sam! Sam!
225;00:20:59,784;00:21:01,885;Come on.
226;00:21:02,219;00:21:03,753;- Right.
227;00:21:04,121;00:21:06,389;I'll deal with this.
228;00:21:08,325;00:21:10,226;- Turn her over.
228;00:21:08,325;00:21:10,226;All right.
229;00:21:12,296;00:21:15,498;I said get your hands off her.
230;00:21:15,832;00:21:17,393;You're gonna
230;00:21:15,832;00:21:17,393;get yourself killed.
231;00:21:17,467;00:21:19,535;Your lover Jon Snow's
231;00:21:17,467;00:21:19,535;not here to save you.
232;00:21:19,903;00:21:22,271;I killed a white walker,
232;00:21:19,903;00:21:22,271;I killed a Thenn.
233;00:21:22,573;00:21:25,140;I'll take my chances with you.
234;00:21:40,690;00:21:43,357;Sam!
235;00:21:45,260;00:21:47,228;I'm all right.
235;00:21:45,260;00:21:47,228;You're not.
236;00:21:47,462;00:21:49,831;Just a bit woozy.
237;00:22:14,722;00:22:17,162;The next time you see something
237;00:22:14,722;00:22:17,162;like that, you leave it alone.
238;00:22:17,458;00:22:20,193;I will not.
238;00:22:17,458;00:22:20,193;They would have...
239;00:22:23,530;00:22:25,365;I don't know what
239;00:22:23,530;00:22:25,365;they would have done.
240;00:22:25,733;00:22:27,901;I know they would have killed
240;00:22:25,733;00:22:27,901;you if Ghost hadn't come.
241;00:22:28,202;00:22:31,036;No. No, no.
241;00:22:28,202;00:22:31,036;They were tiring out.
242;00:22:31,337;00:22:33,839;I had them
242;00:22:31,337;00:22:33,839;in the palm of my hand.
243;00:22:35,075;00:22:37,109;Don't be stupid, Sam.
244;00:22:37,343;00:22:40,012;You're not a fighter.
245;00:22:40,313;00:22:41,546;What kind of man would I be
246;00:22:41,882;00:22:44,183;if I ran away when I saw
246;00:22:41,882;00:22:44,183;someone hurting you?
247;00:22:44,384;00:22:46,852;Just promise me
248;00:22:47,220;00:22:49,655;whatever happens, you'll
248;00:22:47,220;00:22:49,655;take care of Little Sam.
249;00:22:49,889;00:22:51,623;But of course I will.
250;00:22:51,824;00:22:54,025;And...
251;00:22:54,327;00:22:56,528;I'll take care of you, too.
252;00:23:03,068;00:23:04,669;I need more water.
253;00:23:08,507;00:23:10,675;Stay.
254;00:23:10,876;00:23:12,576;Please?
255;00:24:12,902;00:24:14,336;Am I hurting you?
256;00:24:18,274;00:24:19,675;Are you sure?
257;00:24:49,137;00:24:51,539;Oh, my!
258;00:25:09,490;00:25:11,570;A rare find for the
258;00:25:09,490;00:25:11,570;fighting pits, my friends.
259;00:25:11,793;00:25:15,629;Not your usual street tough
259;00:25:11,793;00:25:15,629;or drunken pirate.
260;00:25:15,897;00:25:19,032;This one's a Westerosi knight
261;00:25:19,400;00:25:23,336;from an ancient house
261;00:25:19,400;00:25:23,336;trained in sword and lance.
262;00:25:23,638;00:25:25,906;He fought beside
262;00:25:23,638;00:25:25,906;the stag king Robert
263;00:25:26,206;00:25:27,741;on the far side
263;00:25:26,206;00:25:27,741;of the Narrow Sea.
264;00:25:28,175;00:25:31,010;He was first through the breach
264;00:25:28,175;00:25:31,010;during the Siege of Spike,
265;00:25:31,345;00:25:34,480;slaughtering 50 men
265;00:25:31,345;00:25:34,480;with his flaming sword.
266;00:25:34,848;00:25:38,617;He killed the great Khal
266;00:25:34,848;00:25:38,617;Drogo in single combat.
267;00:25:38,852;00:25:40,987;Betrayed by his woman,
268;00:25:41,355;00:25:44,590;he sold himself into slavery
268;00:25:41,355;00:25:44,590;to repay his debts.
269;00:25:45,025;00:25:48,527;Bidding begins at 12 gold honors.
270;00:25:48,762;00:25:51,997;13.
270;00:25:48,762;00:25:51,997;Do I have 14?
271;00:25:52,231;00:25:55,968;15?
271;00:25:52,231;00:25:55,968;15 gold honors.
272;00:25:56,202;00:25:59,338;Do I hear 16?
272;00:25:56,202;00:25:59,338;16?
273;00:25:59,506;00:26:01,206;20.
274;00:26:01,374;00:26:02,675;Sold.
275;00:26:12,385;00:26:15,020;Wait! You have
275;00:26:12,385;00:26:15,020;to buy me as well.
276;00:26:15,188;00:26:16,588;Why?
277;00:26:17,590;00:26:19,124;We're a team.
278;00:26:19,392;00:26:20,859;I'm a great fighter, too.
279;00:26:24,363;00:26:26,898;He's funny.
279;00:26:24,363;00:26:26,898;You have to give him that.
280;00:26:53,992;00:26:56,660;You're right, he's funny.
281;00:27:04,101;00:27:05,502;Thank you, my lord.
281;00:27:04,101;00:27:05,502;Thank you.
282;00:27:05,670;00:27:06,870;Yes.
283;00:27:07,104;00:27:09,105;My lord, if I may.
284;00:27:09,440;00:27:11,341;I've heard Meereen
284;00:27:09,440;00:27:11,341;has become a free city.
285;00:27:11,809;00:27:14,729;You might run into trouble if you try
285;00:27:11,809;00:27:14,729;to fight slaves in the fighting pits.
286;00:27:14,745;00:27:17,065;Now, if you were to fight freed
286;00:27:14,745;00:27:17,065;men who'd be paid a wage...
287;00:27:20,284;00:27:22,052;There's your wages, funny man.
288;00:27:22,353;00:27:24,687;Should last the rest
288;00:27:22,353;00:27:24,687;of your life.
289;00:27:26,357;00:27:29,158;These are warrior
289;00:27:26,357;00:27:29,158;hands, not a serving girl's.
290;00:27:29,359;00:27:30,960;5, going once...
291;00:27:35,432;00:27:38,434;How long before the King of
291;00:27:35,432;00:27:38,434;Meereen comes to claim my pillow?
292;00:27:38,669;00:27:40,235;Don't be ridiculous.
293;00:27:40,537;00:27:44,306;My marriage to Hizdahr
293;00:27:40,537;00:27:44,306;is political.
294;00:27:44,640;00:27:46,675;I think he's smart enough
294;00:27:44,640;00:27:46,675;to understand that.
295;00:27:48,778;00:27:50,738;I think the Sons of the
295;00:27:48,778;00:27:50,738;Harpy have stopped killing
296;00:27:50,780;00:27:52,714;because their leader
296;00:27:50,780;00:27:52,714;was made king.
297;00:27:55,718;00:27:57,919;Are you jealous?
298;00:27:58,321;00:28:00,556;You think I'm petty enough
298;00:27:58,321;00:28:00,556;to speak ill of a man
299;00:28:00,890;00:28:02,891;just because he
299;00:28:00,890;00:28:02,891;represents competition?
300;00:28:03,059;00:28:04,926;I do.
301;00:28:06,729;00:28:08,296;You're right.
302;00:28:08,564;00:28:11,365;My motivations
302;00:28:08,564;00:28:11,365;are entirely impure.
303;00:28:20,242;00:28:21,875;Doesn't make me wrong.
304;00:28:26,681;00:28:30,451;You told me yourself I can't fight
304;00:28:26,681;00:28:30,451;enemies within and without.
305;00:28:30,752;00:28:32,987;So when enemies without
305;00:28:30,752;00:28:32,987;come knocking,
306;00:28:33,322;00:28:35,055;I need the city
306;00:28:33,322;00:28:35,055;of Meereen behind me.
307;00:28:35,256;00:28:37,691;I have no choice.
308;00:28:37,926;00:28:39,292;Everyone has a choice.
309;00:28:39,560;00:28:40,961;Even slaves
309;00:28:39,560;00:28:40,961;have a choice...
310;00:28:41,195;00:28:42,796;Death or slavery.
311;00:28:43,064;00:28:45,699;So what else can I do, hmm?
312;00:28:47,702;00:28:49,703;Marry me instead.
313;00:28:51,272;00:28:55,575;Even if I wanted to do
313;00:28:51,272;00:28:55,575;such an inadvisable thing,
314;00:28:55,776;00:28:57,144;I couldn't.
315;00:28:57,345;00:28:58,945;Why not?
316;00:28:59,280;00:29:00,947;You are queen.
316;00:28:59,280;00:29:00,947;You can do what you like.
317;00:29:03,384;00:29:06,819;No, I can't.
318;00:29:07,220;00:29:09,622;Then you are the only person
318;00:29:07,220;00:29:09,622;in Meereen who's not free.
319;00:29:21,068;00:29:25,304;And I know I'm here to serve
319;00:29:21,068;00:29:25,304;my queen and not give advice,
320;00:29:25,605;00:29:27,606;but can I make
320;00:29:25,605;00:29:27,606;one more suggestion?
321;00:29:31,711;00:29:33,712;Of course.
322;00:29:36,249;00:29:38,784;On the day of the great games,
323;00:29:39,152;00:29:41,653;gather all the Great
323;00:29:39,152;00:29:41,653;Masters and Wise Masters
324;00:29:41,954;00:29:44,890;and Worthy Masters you can find
325;00:29:45,158;00:29:46,624;and slaughter them all.
326;00:29:50,429;00:29:53,765;I am a queen, not a butcher.
327;00:29:58,737;00:30:01,673;All rulers are either
327;00:29:58,737;00:30:01,673;butchers or meat.
328;00:30:10,816;00:30:13,984;You there. Where would
328;00:30:10,816;00:30:13,984;I find the High Septon
329;00:30:14,419;00:30:17,354;or High Sparrow or whatever
329;00:30:14,419;00:30:17,354;bloody fool name he's got?
330;00:30:17,756;00:30:21,192;It's not as good a name as
330;00:30:17,756;00:30:21,192;Queen of Thorns, I'll admit.
331;00:30:22,861;00:30:24,561;You should have the decency
332;00:30:24,863;00:30:26,931;to stand when
332;00:30:24,863;00:30:26,931;you speak to a lady.
333;00:30:27,332;00:30:29,799;You should have the decency
333;00:30:27,332;00:30:29,799;to kneel before the gods.
334;00:30:30,101;00:30:31,422;Don't spar with me,
334;00:30:30,101;00:30:31,422;little fellow.
335;00:30:34,672;00:30:37,441;For me, it's the knees.
336;00:30:37,642;00:30:39,376;You?
336;00:30:37,642;00:30:39,376;Hips.
337;00:30:39,544;00:30:41,445;Ah.
338;00:30:41,779;00:30:45,449;A man of the people.
338;00:30:41,779;00:30:45,449;Is that your game?
339;00:30:45,783;00:30:49,085;It's an old game.
339;00:30:45,783;00:30:49,085;Dull and unconvincing.
340;00:30:49,319;00:30:51,454;A man of the people
341;00:30:51,789;00:30:54,124;who does Cersei's
341;00:30:51,789;00:30:54,124;dirty work for her.
342;00:30:55,559;00:30:57,227;The people always
342;00:30:55,559;00:30:57,227;do the dirty work.
343;00:30:57,661;00:31:00,163;Spare me the homilies. I can
343;00:30:57,661;00:31:00,163;smell a fraud from a mile away.
344;00:31:00,364;00:31:01,631;Useful talent.
345;00:31:01,966;00:31:04,600;I'm here for my grandson
345;00:31:01,966;00:31:04,600;and granddaughter.
346;00:31:04,901;00:31:07,136;Your grandson and granddaughter
347;00:31:07,404;00:31:10,439;swore sacred vows and lied.
348;00:31:10,707;00:31:12,908;The Father judges us all.
349;00:31:13,143;00:31:15,278;Sons of high lords,
350;00:31:15,512;00:31:17,446;sons of fishermen.
351;00:31:17,814;00:31:20,715;If you break his laws,
351;00:31:17,814;00:31:20,715;you will be punished.
352;00:31:21,985;00:31:23,451;Don't you walk away from me.
353;00:31:23,820;00:31:25,487;You don't give commands
353;00:31:23,820;00:31:25,487;here, Lady Olenna.
354;00:31:25,721;00:31:27,122;What is it you want?
355;00:31:27,323;00:31:29,224;Gold?
356;00:31:29,592;00:31:32,194;I'll make you the richest
356;00:31:29,592;00:31:32,194;septon who ever lived.
357;00:31:33,763;00:31:36,063;What, then?
358;00:31:36,365;00:31:39,000;I imagine this
358;00:31:36,365;00:31:39,000;is strange for you.
359;00:31:39,335;00:31:41,636;Everyone you meet
359;00:31:39,335;00:31:41,636;has a hidden motive
360;00:31:42,004;00:31:45,006;and you pride yourself
360;00:31:42,004;00:31:45,006;on sniffing it out.
361;00:31:45,341;00:31:47,275;But I'm telling you
361;00:31:45,341;00:31:47,275;a simple truth.
362;00:31:47,510;00:31:49,711;I serve the gods.
363;00:31:49,945;00:31:51,646;The gods demand justice.
364;00:31:51,947;00:31:54,182;How do they communicate
364;00:31:51,947;00:31:54,182;their demands?
365;00:31:54,416;00:31:55,950;By raven or horse?
366;00:31:56,285;00:31:58,986;By the holy text,
366;00:31:56,285;00:31:58,986;The Seven-Pointed Star.
367;00:31:59,288;00:32:01,422;If you don't have one
367;00:31:59,288;00:32:01,422;in your library,
368;00:32:01,690;00:32:02,690;I'll give you my own.
369;00:32:03,025;00:32:05,259;I've read
369;00:32:03,025;00:32:05,259;The Seven-Pointed Star.
370;00:32:05,727;00:32:09,663;Then you'll remember the passages
370;00:32:05,727;00:32:09,663;concerning buggery and perjury.
371;00:32:09,964;00:32:12,065;Your grandchildren
371;00:32:09,964;00:32:12,065;will be punished
372;00:32:12,467;00:32:16,670;in the same manner as anyone
372;00:32:12,467;00:32:16,670;who breaks the sacred laws.
373;00:32:16,971;00:32:18,305;Half the men,
373;00:32:16,971;00:32:18,305;women, and children
374;00:32:18,640;00:32:21,809;in this foul city
374;00:32:18,640;00:32:21,809;break the sacred laws.
375;00:32:22,143;00:32:25,145;You live among murderers,
375;00:32:22,143;00:32:25,145;thieves, and rapists,
376;00:32:25,412;00:32:27,113;and yet you punish Loras
377;00:32:27,414;00:32:30,683;for shagging some perfumed ponce
378;00:32:30,985;00:32:32,886;and Margaery for defending
378;00:32:30,985;00:32:32,886;her brother?
379;00:32:33,287;00:32:37,324;Yes. The gods' laws must
379;00:32:33,287;00:32:37,324;be applied to all equally.
380;00:32:37,624;00:32:40,060;If it's equality
380;00:32:37,624;00:32:40,060;you want, so be it.
381;00:32:40,461;00:32:44,063;When House Tyrell stops sending
381;00:32:40,461;00:32:44,063;our crops to the capital,
382;00:32:44,297;00:32:46,298;everyone here will starve.
383;00:32:46,667;00:32:49,369;And I'll make sure the
383;00:32:46,667;00:32:49,369;hungry know who's to blame.
384;00:32:52,673;00:32:55,341;Have you ever sowed the
384;00:32:52,673;00:32:55,341;field, Lady Olenna?
385;00:32:57,811;00:33:00,612;Have you ever reaped the grain?
386;00:33:00,914;00:33:02,447;Has anyone in House Tyrell?
387;00:33:03,950;00:33:05,617;A lifetime of wealth and power
388;00:33:05,919;00:33:07,452;has left you blind in one eye.
389;00:33:09,756;00:33:13,458;You are the few,
389;00:33:09,756;00:33:13,458;we are the many.
390;00:33:15,361;00:33:18,764;And when the many
390;00:33:15,361;00:33:18,764;stop fearing the few...
391;00:33:33,045;00:33:35,613;Lady Olenna.
392;00:33:46,725;00:33:48,405;Starving yourself
392;00:33:46,725;00:33:48,405;won't make things
393;00:33:48,660;00:33:50,828;any better for her, my love.
394;00:33:53,498;00:33:55,299;She's in a prison cell
395;00:33:55,567;00:33:58,335;and there is nothing I can do.
396;00:34:01,706;00:34:03,340;I am the king!
397;00:34:03,742;00:34:06,676;The queen is in prison and
397;00:34:03,742;00:34:06,676;there is nothing I can do!

399;00:34:24,762;00:34:26,663;you are, sooner or later,
400;00:34:27,030;00:34:29,131;you'll face circumstances
400;00:34:27,030;00:34:29,131;beyond your control.
401;00:34:29,500;00:34:32,201;Events you couldn't
401;00:34:29,500;00:34:32,201;possibly have anticipated
402;00:34:32,503;00:34:33,903;or prevented even if you had.
403;00:34:34,204;00:34:37,006;You cannot blame
403;00:34:34,204;00:34:37,006;yourself for fate.
404;00:34:37,207;00:34:39,575;Your father,
405;00:34:39,876;00:34:41,310;your brother,

406;00:34:41,711;00:34:44,613;I was Queen of the Seven
406;00:34:41,711;00:34:44,613;Kingdoms and what could I do?
407;00:34:44,914;00:34:47,283;Hold them as they
407;00:34:44,914;00:34:47,283;left this world.
408;00:34:47,584;00:34:49,251;Kissed their heads
408;00:34:47,584;00:34:49,251;after they'd gone.
409;00:34:49,519;00:34:51,553;I'll call in the army.
410;00:34:51,788;00:34:53,689;I'll take back the sept
411;00:34:53,957;00:34:57,192;and kill every last one of them.
412;00:34:59,261;00:35:01,530;I'll start a war if I have to.
413;00:35:01,965;00:35:05,133;You know as well as I do who the

414;00:35:10,072;00:35:12,073;I love her.
415;00:35:15,144;00:35:17,212;I love her...
416;00:35:19,715;00:35:21,116;and I can't help her.
417;00:35:37,232;00:35:38,633;We must be strong

418;00:35:38,934;00:35:40,935;We cannot give in to despair.
419;00:35:41,236;00:35:44,004;I will speak
419;00:35:41,236;00:35:44,004;with the High Sparrow.
420;00:35:44,272;00:35:45,572;There must be
420;00:35:44,272;00:35:45,572;something he...
421;00:35:45,907;00:35:48,008;Let me talk to him
421;00:35:45,907;00:35:48,008;on your behalf.
422;00:35:48,476;00:35:51,811;The king cannot sully himself
422;00:35:48,476;00:35:51,811;negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.
423;00:35:53,348;00:35:55,215;You will try to help her?
424;00:35:55,650;00:35:58,652;I'll do everything I can to win

425;00:35:58,986;00:36:01,688;I want in this world.
426;00:36:02,957;00:36:05,759;I know.
426;00:36:02,957;00:36:05,759;No, you don't.
427;00:36:09,530;00:36:11,197;You can't possibly.
428;00:36:13,333;00:36:15,802;Not until you have
428;00:36:13,333;00:36:15,802;children of your own.
429;00:36:16,103;00:36:18,504;I would do anything for you.
430;00:36:20,107;00:36:22,341;Anything to keep you from harm.
431;00:36:25,011;00:36:27,012;I would burn cities
431;00:36:25,011;00:36:27,012;to the ground.
432;00:36:28,815;00:36:32,085;You are all that matters.
433;00:36:32,319;00:36:36,055;You and your sister.
434;00:36:36,355;00:36:39,124;From the moment you came
434;00:36:36,355;00:36:39,124;into this world.
435;00:36:39,325;00:36:41,627;My boy.
436;00:36:44,064;00:36:46,065;My only boy.

438;00:37:03,048;00:37:05,417;princess's well-being.
439;00:37:12,658;00:37:14,425;You looked different
439;00:37:12,658;00:37:14,425;when I left.
440;00:37:14,660;00:37:16,728;You had more hair.
441;00:37:16,929;00:37:19,864;And more hands.
442;00:37:20,198;00:37:22,500;How's Trystane?
442;00:37:20,198;00:37:22,500;He'll be all right.
443;00:37:22,734;00:37:23,734;I'm sorry for that.
444;00:37:24,035;00:37:25,515;It wasn't supposed
444;00:37:24,035;00:37:25,515;to happen that way.
445;00:37:25,537;00:37:27,070;Why is it happening at all?
446;00:37:28,840;00:37:31,074;Your mother's worried about you.
447;00:37:31,343;00:37:33,511;Threats have been made.
448;00:37:33,778;00:37:35,045;Dorne's too dangerous for you.
449;00:37:35,413;00:37:37,481;I've come to take you home.
449;00:37:35,413;00:37:37,481;This is my home.
450;00:37:37,749;00:37:39,149;This has been my home for years.

451;00:37:39,517;00:37:41,451;but she told me to.
452;00:37:41,686;00:37:42,686;I did what she said.
453;00:37:43,021;00:37:45,287;I did my duty and now
453;00:37:43,021;00:37:45,287;she's forcing me to go back?
454;00:37:45,689;00:37:48,423;It's for your own good.
454;00:37:45,689;00:37:48,423;These are complicated matters.
455;00:37:48,792;00:37:50,893;No, it's not complicated at all.
455;00:37:48,792;00:37:50,893;It's simple.

554;00:44:40,691;00:44:43,092;you will fight at the Great
554;00:44:40,691;00:44:43,092;Pit of Daznak itself
555;00:44:43,326;00:44:44,694;in front of the queen.
556;00:44:45,128;00:44:49,065;So whatever happens, the gods
556;00:44:45,128;00:44:49,065;have smiled upon you today.
557;00:44:49,499;00:44:53,369;This is the day your lives
557;00:44:49,499;00:44:53,369;actually start to mean something.
558;00:44:55,705;00:44:58,140;You and you.
558;00:44:55,705;00:44:58,140;You.
559;00:44:59,609;00:45:01,444;You two.
560;00:45:03,813;00:45:05,147;You, you, and you.
561;00:45:06,149;00:45:08,084;Up.
562;00:45:08,452;00:45:11,053;- Valar morghulis.
562;00:45:08,452;00:45:11,053;Valar dohaeris.
563;00:45:11,287;00:45:13,121;Prepare yourselves.
564;00:45:25,401;00:45:27,935;Sitting through the great
564;00:45:25,401;00:45:27,935;games will be bad enough.
565;00:45:28,370;00:45:30,972;For generations in the days
565;00:45:28,370;00:45:30,972;leading up to the great games,
566;00:45:31,307;00:45:32,668;it has been customary
566;00:45:31,307;00:45:32,668;for our ruler
567;00:45:32,841;00:45:34,375;to make the rounds
567;00:45:32,841;00:45:34,375;of the lower pits
568;00:45:34,743;00:45:36,877;to pay the fighters there
568;00:45:34,743;00:45:36,877;the honor of her presence.
569;00:45:40,816;00:45:43,884;Move yourselves.
570;00:45:50,191;00:45:51,558;Your Grace.
571;00:45:51,760;00:45:52,960;Your future Grace.
572;00:45:53,194;00:45:55,395;You honor us all.
573;00:45:57,899;00:46:00,067;Stand there.
574;00:46:00,401;00:46:02,702;Stand straight.
574;00:46:00,401;00:46:02,702;That's the fucking queen.
575;00:46:04,739;00:46:06,340;We fight and
575;00:46:04,739;00:46:06,340;die for your glory,
576;00:46:06,407;00:46:08,275;O glorious queen.
577;00:46:11,112;00:46:13,180;We fight and
577;00:46:11,112;00:46:13,180;die for your glory,
578;00:46:13,414;00:46:15,048;O glorious queen.
579;00:46:16,684;00:46:19,052;Fight!
580;00:47:17,577;00:47:18,610;I think I've seen enough.
581;00:47:18,911;00:47:21,613;Your Grace, it is a tradition
582;00:47:21,980;00:47:24,949;for the queen to stay
582;00:47:21,980;00:47:24,949;until the victor has emerged.
583;00:47:25,350;00:47:27,430;I've sacrificed more than
583;00:47:25,350;00:47:27,430;enough for your traditions.
584;00:47:32,191;00:47:33,591;What are you doing?
585;00:47:42,867;00:47:44,547;Wait your turn,
585;00:47:42,867;00:47:44,547;you piece of fucking filth.
586;00:49:14,222;00:49:15,689;Get him out of my sight.
587;00:49:15,924;00:49:17,958;Khaleesi, please.
588;00:49:18,259;00:49:20,393;I just need
588;00:49:18,259;00:49:20,393;a moment of your time.
589;00:49:20,628;00:49:22,262;I brought you a gift.
590;00:49:23,531;00:49:25,031;It's true.
591;00:49:26,434;00:49:28,868;He has.
592;00:49:29,069;00:49:30,737;Who are you?
593;00:49:32,072;00:49:33,973;I am the gift.
594;00:49:36,109;00:49:38,778;It's a pleasure
594;00:49:36,109;00:49:38,778;to meet you, Your Grace.
595;00:49:39,947;00:49:41,948;My name is Tyrion Lannister.
596;00:50:15,114;00:50:16,848;This is horrible.
597;00:50:17,083;00:50:18,984;Unacceptable.
598;00:50:20,786;00:50:22,988;Are they feeding you
598;00:50:20,786;00:50:22,988;enough at least?
599;00:50:24,357;00:50:27,325;I brought you this.
599;00:50:24,357;00:50:27,325;Venison.
600;00:50:27,526;00:50:29,494;It's quite good.
601;00:50:32,664;00:50:35,433;I had it myself for supper
601;00:50:32,664;00:50:35,433;only last night.
602;00:50:39,671;00:50:42,473;We did everything we could from the
602;00:50:39,671;00:50:42,473;moment they took your brother.
603;00:50:42,808;00:50:44,609;Tommen even went
603;00:50:42,808;00:50:44,609;to the sept himself
604;00:50:44,877;00:50:47,011;to confront the High Sparrow.
605;00:50:47,345;00:50:50,080;But I fear the Faith
605;00:50:47,345;00:50:50,080;has left reason behind.
606;00:50:50,315;00:50:53,150;I know you did this.
607;00:50:53,484;00:50:56,987;We are making every effort
607;00:50:53,484;00:50:56,987;on your behalf.
608;00:50:57,289;00:50:59,523;I swear to you
608;00:50:57,289;00:50:59,523;by all the seven gods.
609;00:50:59,791;00:51:01,658;Lies come easily to you.
610;00:51:01,893;00:51:03,327;Everyone knows that.
611;00:51:03,528;00:51:06,262;But innocence,
612;00:51:06,497;00:51:08,932;decency, concern,
613;00:51:09,300;00:51:11,701;you're not very good
613;00:51:09,300;00:51:11,701;at those, I'm afraid.
614;00:51:13,370;00:51:15,439;Perhaps that's why
614;00:51:13,370;00:51:15,439;your son was so eager
615;00:51:15,706;00:51:17,340;to cast you aside for me.
616;00:51:19,410;00:51:21,544;You're upset.
617;00:51:21,845;00:51:23,980;You're not thinking clearly.
618;00:51:24,381;00:51:26,542;I'll visit again when you've
618;00:51:24,381;00:51:26,542;had a chance to calm down.
619;00:51:26,550;00:51:28,284;I don't want to see you again.
620;00:51:28,652;00:51:30,553;I do hope you change
620;00:51:28,652;00:51:30,553;your mind about that.
621;00:51:30,854;00:51:33,256;I've been told men often go mad
622;00:51:33,557;00:51:35,858;in the Black Cells
622;00:51:33,557;00:51:35,858;beneath the Red Keep.
623;00:51:36,193;00:51:37,460;Though I suppose
623;00:51:36,193;00:51:37,460;your isolation will end
624;00:51:37,694;00:51:39,829;when your trial begins.
625;00:51:41,264;00:51:43,098;Leave.
626;00:51:43,266;00:51:44,934;Yes.
627;00:51:45,168;00:51:46,602;I'm afraid I must.
628;00:51:46,937;00:51:48,704;My son needs me now
628;00:51:46,937;00:51:48,704;more than ever.
629;00:51:49,005;00:51:51,340;Get out, you hateful bitch!
630;00:52:05,521;00:52:07,356;Sleep well, sister.
631;00:52:35,117;00:52:36,484;Thank you, Boake.
632;00:52:43,758;00:52:45,258;You saw her?
632;00:52:43,758;00:52:45,258;Yes.
633;00:52:45,627;00:52:48,028;And?
633;00:52:45,627;00:52:48,028;Her accommodations seem sufficient.
634;00:52:48,295;00:52:50,430;What happens to her now?
635;00:52:50,765;00:52:52,733;Well, she and her brother
635;00:52:50,765;00:52:52,733;are both being held
636;00:52:52,967;00:52:54,768;under fair suspicion.
637;00:52:55,069;00:52:57,203;A trial will be held
637;00:52:55,069;00:52:57,203;for each of them
638;00:52:57,505;00:53:00,340;to determine if they're
638;00:52:57,505;00:53:00,340;guilty of any acts
639;00:53:00,774;00:53:03,910;that might constitute a violation
639;00:53:00,774;00:53:03,910;of the tenets of the faith.
640;00:53:04,145;00:53:05,811;Who will stand judge?
641;00:53:06,247;00:53:09,982;Seven septons as it was in all
641;00:53:06,247;00:53:09,982;trials before the Targaryens.
642;00:53:11,618;00:53:12,618;Will you be one of them?
643;00:53:12,753;00:53:14,154;I will.
644;00:53:16,657;00:53:18,457;If one or both of them
645;00:53:18,792;00:53:21,027;were to confess
645;00:53:18,792;00:53:21,027;before the trial...
646;00:53:21,361;00:53:23,195;Then they will be shown
646;00:53:21,361;00:53:23,195;the Mother's mercy.
647;00:53:24,497;00:53:26,766;And what does
647;00:53:24,497;00:53:26,766;the Mother's mercy entail?
648;00:53:27,034;00:53:29,134;It depends upon the situation.
649;00:53:29,502;00:53:32,237;The acts themselves,
649;00:53:29,502;00:53:32,237;the degree of contrition.
650;00:53:32,505;00:53:35,207;Thank you, High Septon,
651;00:53:35,608;00:53:37,943;for bringing them whatever
651;00:53:35,608;00:53:37,943;justice they deserve
652;00:53:38,211;00:53:40,812;in the eyes of the Seven.
653;00:53:44,984;00:53:46,418;Did you know this chapel
654;00:53:46,819;00:53:49,153;is one of the oldest
654;00:53:46,819;00:53:49,153;structures in King's Landing?
655;00:53:50,957;00:53:53,124;I think I may have
655;00:53:50,957;00:53:53,124;heard at one point.
656;00:53:53,392;00:53:55,994;Baelor built his sept around it.
657;00:53:57,663;00:54:00,632;But men worshipped here
657;00:53:57,663;00:54:00,632;long before him.
658;00:54:00,866;00:54:03,401;Who carved this altar?
659;00:54:03,703;00:54:06,737;Do you know?
659;00:54:03,703;00:54:06,737;I'm afraid I don't.
660;00:54:06,905;00:54:09,039;No one does.
661;00:54:09,408;00:54:12,843;There's no name on it or
661;00:54:09,408;00:54:12,843;anywhere else in the chapel.
662;00:54:15,046;00:54:17,181;No, the people
662;00:54:15,046;00:54:17,181;who built this place
663;00:54:17,549;00:54:21,419;didn't inflict their vanity
663;00:54:17,549;00:54:21,419;on those who came after them
664;00:54:21,853;00:54:25,255;the way Baelor did with that great
664;00:54:21,853;00:54:25,255;gilded monstrosity up there.
665;00:54:25,423;00:54:26,991;Hmm.
666;00:54:27,225;00:54:29,226;Their faith was clean.
667;00:54:30,729;00:54:33,196;Strip away the gold
667;00:54:30,729;00:54:33,196;and the ornaments,
668;00:54:33,531;00:54:36,934;knock down the statues
668;00:54:33,531;00:54:36,934;and the pillars,
669;00:54:37,201;00:54:39,169;and this is what remains.
670;00:54:42,273;00:54:44,674;Something simple...
671;00:54:48,045;00:54:51,248;and solid and true.
672;00:54:55,953;00:54:58,955;The Tyrells' finery
672;00:54:55,953;00:54:58,955;will be stripped away.
673;00:55:00,390;00:55:02,058;Their lies knocked down.
674;00:55:02,425;00:55:05,094;Their true hearts
674;00:55:02,425;00:55:05,094;laid bare for all to see.
675;00:55:06,563;00:55:09,198;And so it will be for all of us.
676;00:55:09,432;00:55:11,800;High and low alike.
677;00:55:16,039;00:55:18,073;What will we find
678;00:55:18,375;00:55:21,109;when we strip away your finery?
679;00:55:24,581;00:55:27,816;A young man came to us
679;00:55:24,581;00:55:27,816;not long ago.
680;00:55:28,084;00:55:30,752;Broken in body and spirit.
681;00:55:33,089;00:55:35,157;He had so much to strip away.
682;00:55:37,226;00:55:40,762;So much weighing him down.
683;00:55:41,130;00:55:43,999;But piece by piece,
683;00:55:41,130;00:55:43,999;he unburdened himself.
684;00:55:45,668;00:55:47,535;Let go of vanity,
685;00:55:47,736;00:55:50,071;pride, sin.
686;00:55:52,808;00:55:55,210;Now his soul is so light,
687;00:55:55,611;00:55:58,446;he will float through the
687;00:55:55,611;00:55:58,446;Seven Heavens like a bird.
688;00:55:58,614;00:56:00,081;Hmm.
689;00:56:05,286;00:56:07,722;And he has much
689;00:56:05,286;00:56:07,722;to say about you.
690;00:56:32,012;00:56:33,614;Move.
691;00:56:35,850;00:56:38,251;Let me go immediately.
692;00:56:38,552;00:56:41,221;You will order her to let me go.
693;00:56:41,521;00:56:43,923;I am the queen!
693;00:56:41,521;00:56:43,923;I am the queen!
694;00:56:44,158;00:56:45,625;Have you lost your mind?
695;00:56:45,826;00:56:47,360;Let me go!
696;00:56:48,996;00:56:50,896;Get your filthy hands off me!
