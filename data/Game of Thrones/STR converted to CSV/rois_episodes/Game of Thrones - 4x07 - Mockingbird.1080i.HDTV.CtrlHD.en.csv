1;00:03:32,612;00:03:35,664;I made a deal for you
1;00:03:32,612;00:03:35,664;to keep your ungrateful head
2;00:03:35,698;00:03:37,616;on your ungrateful neck
2;00:03:35,698;00:03:37,616;a little while longer.
3;00:03:37,667;00:03:39,501;I'm sorry,
3;00:03:37,667;00:03:39,501;what am I grateful for?
4;00:03:39,535;00:03:41,319;The opportunity to live
4;00:03:39,535;00:03:41,319;and die at the Wall
5;00:03:41,337;00:03:43,321;as punishment for a crime
5;00:03:41,337;00:03:43,321;I did not commit?
6;00:03:43,339;00:03:45,540;You threw your life away.
6;00:03:43,339;00:03:45,540;You threw it away.
7;00:03:45,592;00:03:48,293;It's not a joke.
7;00:03:45,592;00:03:48,293;You understand that, don't you?
8;00:03:48,327;00:03:51,013;Of course it's a joke,
8;00:03:48,327;00:03:51,013;just not a very funny one.
9;00:03:53,800;00:03:55,717;I couldn't--
10;00:03:55,768;00:03:57,669;I couldn't listen to her
11;00:03:57,687;00:04:00,105;standing there
11;00:03:57,687;00:04:00,105;telling her lies.
12;00:04:00,139;00:04:01,506;I couldn't do it.
13;00:04:01,524;00:04:04,109;You fell in love
13;00:04:01,524;00:04:04,109;with a whore.
14;00:04:04,143;00:04:06,194;Yes, I fell in love
14;00:04:04,143;00:04:06,194;with a whore.
15;00:04:06,229;00:04:09,982;And I was stupid enough to think
15;00:04:06,229;00:04:09,982;that she had fallen in love with me.
16;00:04:14,287;00:04:16,371;That deal you made,
17;00:04:16,406;00:04:19,190;it was everything
17;00:04:16,406;00:04:19,190;Father wanted.
18;00:04:19,208;00:04:20,525;You do see that?
19;00:04:20,543;00:04:22,411;He gets you back
19;00:04:20,543;00:04:22,411;as his heir.
20;00:04:22,462;00:04:24,663;The future
20;00:04:22,462;00:04:24,663;Lord of the Rock.
21;00:04:24,697;00:04:27,332;And he ships me off
21;00:04:24,697;00:04:27,332;to Castle Black,
22;00:04:27,383;00:04:29,167;out of sight at last.
23;00:04:30,637;00:04:32,671;All so perfect.
24;00:04:34,707;00:04:37,142;It felt good
24;00:04:34,707;00:04:37,142;to take that from him.
25;00:04:38,845;00:04:42,564;He knows I'm innocent and he's
25;00:04:38,845;00:04:42,564;willing to sacrifice me anyway.
26;00:04:42,598;00:04:44,549;He's willing
26;00:04:42,598;00:04:44,549;to sacrifice any of us.
27;00:04:44,567;00:04:46,318;Not you.
28;00:04:46,352;00:04:48,487;You're the golden son.
29;00:04:48,521;00:04:50,856;You could kill a king,
29;00:04:48,521;00:04:50,856;lose a hand,
30;00:04:50,908;00:04:53,108;fuck your own sister, you'll
30;00:04:50,908;00:04:53,108;always be the golden son.
31;00:04:53,159;00:04:54,593;Careful.
32;00:04:54,627;00:04:56,995;I'm the last friend
32;00:04:54,627;00:04:56,995;you've got.
33;00:05:01,034;00:05:04,036;At least I got to tell
33;00:05:01,034;00:05:04,036;them what they really are.
34;00:05:04,070;00:05:06,204;Yes, brilliant speech.
35;00:05:06,238;00:05:08,573;They'll be talking
35;00:05:06,238;00:05:08,573;about it for days to come.
36;00:05:08,591;00:05:11,009;I thought you were
36;00:05:08,591;00:05:11,009;a realist.
37;00:05:11,044;00:05:13,679;Didn't realize
37;00:05:11,044;00:05:13,679;you'd die for pride.
38;00:05:13,713;00:05:16,431;Don't give up on me
38;00:05:13,713;00:05:16,431;just yet.
39;00:05:16,466;00:05:19,017;I survived one
39;00:05:16,466;00:05:19,017;trial by combat,
40;00:05:19,052;00:05:21,103;even though you weren't
40;00:05:19,052;00:05:21,103;there to save me.
41;00:05:21,137;00:05:23,605;I can't save you
41;00:05:21,137;00:05:23,605;this time either.
42;00:05:24,941;00:05:27,309;My training has proved
43;00:05:27,360;00:05:30,195;that I can't beat a stable
43;00:05:27,360;00:05:30,195;boy with my left hand.
44;00:05:30,229;00:05:33,315;Where's your sense
44;00:05:30,229;00:05:33,315;of adventure?
45;00:05:34,567;00:05:36,568;Even if you lose,
45;00:05:34,567;00:05:36,568;imagine the look
46;00:05:36,619;00:05:37,869;on Father's face
46;00:05:36,619;00:05:37,869;when you fall.
47;00:05:37,904;00:05:40,238;Our family name snuffed out
48;00:05:40,272;00:05:43,008;with a single swing
48;00:05:40,272;00:05:43,008;of the sword.
49;00:05:43,042;00:05:44,626;It is tempting.
50;00:06:00,793;00:06:02,344;Well...
51;00:06:02,395;00:06:05,297;Bronn fought for me once,
51;00:06:02,395;00:06:05,297;he'll do it again.
52;00:06:06,650;00:06:08,767;If he wins,
53;00:06:08,818;00:06:10,819;I expect I'll be
53;00:06:08,818;00:06:10,819;in his debt
54;00:06:10,853;00:06:12,687;for the rest
54;00:06:10,853;00:06:12,687;of my life.
55;00:06:12,739;00:06:14,406;If he wins.
56;00:06:14,440;00:06:15,824;Will you find him for me?
57;00:06:18,694;00:06:21,813;Who does Cersei plan
57;00:06:18,694;00:06:21,813;on naming as a champion?
58;00:06:21,831;00:06:24,583;I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant.
59;00:06:24,617;00:06:28,086;I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel
59;00:06:24,617;00:06:28,086;that pompous child beater.
60;00:06:28,121;00:06:29,988;No.
61;00:06:30,006;00:06:32,541;Not Ser Meryn.
62;00:06:42,468;00:06:44,286;Go on, move it.
63;00:06:44,320;00:06:46,688;And you.
64;00:06:46,722;00:06:48,557;Come on.
65;00:06:58,201;00:07:00,735;Mercy.
66;00:07:00,787;00:07:02,370;Please.
67;00:07:02,405;00:07:04,322;Please, mercy.
68;00:07:14,217;00:07:17,752;Ser Gregor.
68;00:07:14,217;00:07:17,752;Welcome to the capital.
69;00:07:19,305;00:07:21,640;Thank you for riding
69;00:07:19,305;00:07:21,640;here so quickly.
70;00:07:24,844;00:07:27,596;You seem to be
70;00:07:24,844;00:07:27,596;in good form.
71;00:07:27,647;00:07:29,598;Who am I fighting?
72;00:07:29,649;00:07:31,817;Does it matter?
73;00:07:55,608;00:07:57,092;Could be food.
74;00:07:57,126;00:07:59,177;Could be soldiers.
75;00:08:23,903;00:08:26,238;You shouldn't be sitting
75;00:08:23,903;00:08:26,238;out here like this.
76;00:08:26,272;00:08:28,657;Where else to sit?
77;00:08:28,708;00:08:31,493;Tried to walk back
77;00:08:28,708;00:08:31,493;to my hut,
78;00:08:31,527;00:08:34,012;hurt too much.
79;00:08:35,147;00:08:37,432;Then I remembered
79;00:08:35,147;00:08:37,432;they burned my hut down.
80;00:08:37,466;00:08:39,551;Who were they?
81;00:08:39,585;00:08:42,120;I stopped asking
81;00:08:39,585;00:08:42,120;a while ago.
82;00:08:46,309;00:08:48,843;That's not gonna
82;00:08:46,309;00:08:48,843;get better.
83;00:08:48,895;00:08:50,145;Doesn't seem so.
84;00:08:50,263;00:08:52,230;A bad way to go.
85;00:08:53,916;00:08:55,800;Haven't you had enough?
86;00:08:55,835;00:08:57,569;Of what?
87;00:09:00,606;00:09:02,607;I know.
88;00:09:02,658;00:09:04,876;Time to go.
89;00:09:04,911;00:09:07,746;Take matters into
89;00:09:04,911;00:09:07,746;my own hands.
90;00:09:09,982;00:09:12,534;The thought
90;00:09:09,982;00:09:12,534;has occurred to me.
91;00:09:16,088;00:09:18,039;So why go on?
92;00:09:19,041;00:09:20,926;Habit.
93;00:09:23,362;00:09:25,547;Nothing could
93;00:09:23,362;00:09:25,547;be worse than this.
94;00:09:25,598;00:09:29,134;Maybe nothing is
94;00:09:25,598;00:09:29,134;worse than this.
95;00:09:30,436;00:09:34,889;Nothing isn't better
95;00:09:30,436;00:09:34,889;or worse than anything.
96;00:09:37,343;00:09:39,778;Nothing is just nothing.
97;00:09:43,916;00:09:46,151;Who are you?
98;00:09:48,154;00:09:50,405;My name is Arya.
99;00:09:50,456;00:09:52,707;Arya Stark.
100;00:09:55,895;00:09:57,996;You her father?
101;00:09:58,030;00:09:59,831;Her captor.
102;00:09:59,865;00:10:02,968;Bringing her to her aunt
102;00:09:59,865;00:10:02,968;for ransom.
103;00:10:03,002;00:10:06,871;A fair exchange,
103;00:10:03,002;00:10:06,871;that is.
104;00:10:09,592;00:10:12,427;Always held to the notion
104;00:10:09,592;00:10:12,427;of fair exchange
105;00:10:12,478;00:10:15,063;in all my dealings.
106;00:10:15,097;00:10:18,516;You give me,
106;00:10:15,097;00:10:18,516;I give you.
107;00:10:19,718;00:10:21,486;Fair.
108;00:10:21,520;00:10:23,989;A balance.
109;00:10:26,108;00:10:28,193;No balance anymore.
110;00:10:33,783;00:10:35,950;Could I have
110;00:10:33,783;00:10:35,950;a drink?
111;00:10:36,002;00:10:38,286;Dying is thirsty work.
112;00:10:48,347;00:10:50,048;Wish it were wine.
113;00:10:51,350;00:10:53,134;So do I.
114;00:11:12,288;00:11:14,205;That's where the heart is.
115;00:11:18,127;00:11:19,794;That's how you kill a man.
116;00:11:27,254;00:11:29,087;The fuck you doing?
117;00:11:30,923;00:11:32,957;There's a price
117;00:11:30,923;00:11:32,957;on your head.
118;00:11:32,975;00:11:35,760;Guess that's what the king does
118;00:11:32,975;00:11:35,760;when you tell him to fuck off.
119;00:11:35,794;00:11:37,162;The king's dead.
120;00:11:37,196;00:11:40,315;He drank poisoned wine
120;00:11:37,196;00:11:40,315;at his own wedding.
121;00:11:40,349;00:11:43,351;The bounty on you is for
121;00:11:40,349;00:11:43,351;killing Lannister soldiers.
122;00:11:43,402;00:11:44,802;100 silver stags.
123;00:11:44,820;00:11:46,688;And you thought you
123;00:11:44,820;00:11:46,688;were going to collect it?
124;00:11:46,739;00:11:49,824;Didn't think very hard,
124;00:11:46,739;00:11:49,824;did you?
125;00:11:49,859;00:11:53,478;You were Yoren's prisoners when
125;00:11:49,859;00:11:53,478;he was taking me to the Wall.
126;00:11:53,496;00:11:56,781;He told me he'd fuck
126;00:11:53,496;00:11:56,781;me bloody with a stick.
127;00:11:56,815;00:12:00,702;This day's really not working
127;00:11:56,815;00:12:00,702;out the way you planned.
128;00:12:00,736;00:12:02,871;He on your little list?
129;00:12:02,905;00:12:05,290;He can't be.
130;00:12:05,324;00:12:07,709;I don't know his name.
131;00:12:08,961;00:12:10,528;What's your name?
132;00:12:12,031;00:12:14,048;Rorge.
132;00:12:12,031;00:12:14,048;Thank you.
133;00:12:20,856;00:12:22,891;You're learning.
134;00:12:27,813;00:12:30,782;Rangers returning!
135;00:12:33,119;00:12:35,120;They return!
136;00:12:35,154;00:12:38,022;Rangers returning!
136;00:12:35,154;00:12:38,022;Greetings.
137;00:12:38,040;00:12:40,208;Didn't think I'd see
137;00:12:38,040;00:12:40,208;you again.
138;00:12:40,242;00:12:41,859;All right, Jon?
139;00:12:41,877;00:12:43,528;Welcome back, brother.
140;00:12:52,471;00:12:54,556;Lord Snow.
141;00:12:59,762;00:13:02,096;This is no place
141;00:12:59,762;00:13:02,096;for wild beasts.
142;00:13:02,148;00:13:04,098;Lock him away
143;00:13:04,150;00:13:06,267;or I'll let Hobb throw him
143;00:13:04,150;00:13:06,267;in tonight's stew.
144;00:13:17,329;00:13:19,197;Come on, Ghost.
145;00:13:21,250;00:13:25,453;Mance's army was closing in
145;00:13:21,250;00:13:25,453;on Craster's Keep when we left.
146;00:13:25,504;00:13:28,289;We saw their campfires
146;00:13:25,504;00:13:28,289;from Osric's Hill.
147;00:13:28,374;00:13:30,124;They'll reach the Wall
147;00:13:28,374;00:13:30,124;before the next full moon.
148;00:13:30,176;00:13:32,494;I'm surprised you didn't
148;00:13:30,176;00:13:32,494;ride over and say hello.
149;00:13:32,528;00:13:34,712;The King-beyond-the-Wall
149;00:13:32,528;00:13:34,712;is your old friend, isn't he?
150;00:13:34,763;00:13:36,297;We need to prepare.
151;00:13:36,382;00:13:37,715;We've been preparing.
152;00:13:37,749;00:13:39,100;We should seal the tunnel.
153;00:13:40,886;00:13:42,420;Plug it with rocks
153;00:13:40,886;00:13:42,420;and ice.
154;00:13:42,438;00:13:43,888;Flood it
154;00:13:42,438;00:13:43,888;and let it freeze.
155;00:13:43,922;00:13:45,356;And how would we
155;00:13:43,922;00:13:45,356;range north?
156;00:13:45,391;00:13:47,425;We wouldn't.
156;00:13:45,391;00:13:47,425;- Coward.
157;00:13:47,443;00:13:49,260;You would cut off
157;00:13:47,443;00:13:49,260;our legs,
158;00:13:49,278;00:13:50,895;pluck out our eyes,
159;00:13:50,929;00:13:52,814;leave us cowering
159;00:13:50,929;00:13:52,814;behind the Wall
160;00:13:52,865;00:13:54,732;hoping for the storm
160;00:13:52,865;00:13:54,732;to pass?
161;00:13:54,766;00:13:57,318;We can't defend the gate
161;00:13:54,766;00:13:57,318;against 100,000 men.
162;00:13:57,369;00:13:59,821;This castle has stood
162;00:13:57,369;00:13:59,821;for thousands of years.
163;00:13:59,872;00:14:03,208;The Night's Watch has defended
163;00:13:59,872;00:14:03,208;her for thousands of years.
164;00:14:03,242;00:14:06,327;And in all those centuries, we
164;00:14:03,242;00:14:06,327;have never sealed the tunnel.
165;00:14:06,378;00:14:08,630;Have you ever seen
165;00:14:06,378;00:14:08,630;a giant, Ser Alliser?
166;00:14:08,664;00:14:10,849;I have.
167;00:14:10,883;00:14:12,800;The tunnel's gate
167;00:14:10,883;00:14:12,800;won't stop them.
168;00:14:12,835;00:14:14,919;The bars on those gates
168;00:14:12,835;00:14:14,919;are four inches thick.
169;00:14:14,953;00:14:16,638;Cold-rolled steel.
170;00:14:16,672;00:14:18,890;They won't stop them.
171;00:14:20,392;00:14:23,228;Remind me which order
171;00:14:20,392;00:14:23,228;you belong to, Lord Snow.
172;00:14:23,262;00:14:25,230;The stewards.
173;00:14:25,264;00:14:28,199;Are the stewards responsible
173;00:14:25,264;00:14:28,199;for maintaining the tunnel?
174;00:14:28,234;00:14:30,635;No.
175;00:14:30,687;00:14:32,320;Who would that be?
176;00:14:33,989;00:14:36,107;The builders.
176;00:14:33,989;00:14:36,107;Ah, the builders.
177;00:14:36,141;00:14:38,326;First Builder Yarwyck,
178;00:14:38,360;00:14:41,329;Lord Snow here recommends
178;00:14:38,360;00:14:41,329;sealing the tunnel,
179;00:14:41,363;00:14:44,032;leaving us unable
179;00:14:41,363;00:14:44,032;to carry out our duties
180;00:14:44,083;00:14:46,868;as sworn brothers
180;00:14:44,083;00:14:46,868;of the Night's Watch.
181;00:14:46,919;00:14:49,037;Do you agree with him?
182;00:14:57,680;00:14:59,297;No.
183;00:15:00,999;00:15:03,968;Given your deep knowledge of
183;00:15:00,999;00:15:03,968;the wildling army, Lord Snow,
184;00:15:04,002;00:15:07,355;you and Tarly will take
184;00:15:04,002;00:15:07,355;night duties atop the Wall
185;00:15:07,389;00:15:09,274;until the full moon.
186;00:15:11,277;00:15:13,061;Moving on.
187;00:15:13,112;00:15:16,981;First Builder, we'll need 100 barrels
187;00:15:13,112;00:15:16,981;of pitch brought atop the wall.
188;00:15:17,015;00:15:18,566;Aye.
189;00:15:42,374;00:15:44,392;My lord.
190;00:15:46,145;00:15:48,379;You have new clothes.
191;00:15:48,397;00:15:50,682;Do you like 'em?
191;00:15:48,397;00:15:50,682;Eh?
192;00:15:52,217;00:15:54,102;Gloves are doeskin.
193;00:15:54,153;00:15:55,570;Softer than
193;00:15:54,153;00:15:55,570;a virgin's thighs.
194;00:15:55,604;00:15:57,021;I sent for you
194;00:15:55,604;00:15:57,021;days ago.
195;00:15:57,055;00:15:59,857;I've been a bit busy.
195;00:15:57,055;00:15:59,857;Doing what?
196;00:16:02,394;00:16:05,530;My lonesome
196;00:16:02,394;00:16:05,530;bachelor days are over.
197;00:16:07,249;00:16:09,400;I'm to wed
197;00:16:07,249;00:16:09,400;Lollys Stokeworth.
198;00:16:10,703;00:16:12,620;Lollys Stokeworth?
199;00:16:12,655;00:16:16,240;She doesn't strike me
199;00:16:12,655;00:16:16,240;as your sort of girl.
200;00:16:16,258;00:16:19,260;I wouldn't say I had
200;00:16:16,258;00:16:19,260;a single sort of girl.
201;00:16:19,294;00:16:20,878;She's dim-witted.
202;00:16:20,912;00:16:22,313;If I wanted wits,
202;00:16:20,912;00:16:22,313;I'd marry you.
203;00:16:22,348;00:16:25,266;When my sister arranged
203;00:16:22,348;00:16:25,266;this love match,
204;00:16:25,300;00:16:28,436;did she mention that Lollys
204;00:16:25,300;00:16:28,436;has an older sister?
205;00:16:28,470;00:16:29,887;Falyse.
206;00:16:29,921;00:16:32,273;Aye, I did know
206;00:16:29,921;00:16:32,273;about the older sister.
207;00:16:32,307;00:16:34,359;And you understand
207;00:16:32,307;00:16:34,359;the rules of inheritance?
208;00:16:34,393;00:16:35,693;Falyse is 40
208;00:16:34,393;00:16:35,693;and barren.
209;00:16:35,728;00:16:38,929;She still gets Castle Stokeworth
209;00:16:35,728;00:16:38,929;when her father dies.
210;00:16:38,947;00:16:40,398;She does.
211;00:16:40,432;00:16:42,650;Unless she happens
211;00:16:40,432;00:16:42,650;to perish before her father.
212;00:16:42,701;00:16:44,569;Then Lollys gets the castle.
213;00:16:46,655;00:16:48,623;What? Ladies fall
213;00:16:46,655;00:16:48,623;from their horses
214;00:16:48,657;00:16:50,775;and snap their pretty
214;00:16:48,657;00:16:50,775;necks all the time.
215;00:16:50,793;00:16:53,244;You and my sister
215;00:16:50,793;00:16:53,244;deserve each other.
216;00:16:53,278;00:16:56,080;Why did you bother
216;00:16:53,278;00:16:56,080;to come here?
217;00:17:01,837;00:17:05,807;You once said if anyone ever
217;00:17:01,837;00:17:05,807;asked me to sell you out,
218;00:17:05,841;00:17:07,425;you'd double their price.
219;00:17:07,459;00:17:09,761;Is it two wives you want
219;00:17:07,459;00:17:09,761;or two castles?
220;00:17:09,812;00:17:11,512;One of each will do.
221;00:17:11,563;00:17:15,099;But if you want me to kill
221;00:17:11,563;00:17:15,099;the Mountain for you,
222;00:17:15,133;00:17:16,934;it'd better be
222;00:17:15,133;00:17:16,934;a damn big castle.
223;00:17:16,968;00:17:19,320;I'm a bit short
223;00:17:16,968;00:17:19,320;on castles at the moment.
224;00:17:19,354;00:17:21,155;But I can offer you
224;00:17:19,354;00:17:21,155;gold and gratitude.
225;00:17:21,190;00:17:22,857;I have gold.
226;00:17:22,908;00:17:24,325;What can I buy
226;00:17:22,908;00:17:24,325;with gratitude?
227;00:17:24,359;00:17:25,910;You might be surprised.
228;00:17:25,944;00:17:28,780;A Lannister always
228;00:17:25,944;00:17:28,780;pays his debts.
229;00:17:28,832;00:17:30,615;Your sister's
229;00:17:28,832;00:17:30,615;a Lannister, too.
230;00:17:30,649;00:17:32,366;My wife is heir
230;00:17:30,649;00:17:32,366;to Winterfell.
231;00:17:32,418;00:17:36,254;If I emerge from this with my
231;00:17:32,418;00:17:36,254;head still on my shoulders,
232;00:17:36,288;00:17:40,058;I may one day rule
232;00:17:36,288;00:17:40,058;the North in her name.
233;00:17:40,092;00:17:43,177;I could carve you out
233;00:17:40,092;00:17:43,177;a big piece of it.
234;00:17:43,212;00:17:45,179;If and may and could.
235;00:17:45,214;00:17:47,732;It's bloody
235;00:17:45,214;00:17:47,732;cold up north.
236;00:17:47,766;00:17:50,184;Lollys is soft and warm.
237;00:17:50,219;00:17:52,002;And close.
238;00:17:52,020;00:17:54,689;If I gave you the choice
238;00:17:52,020;00:17:54,689;between fucking Lollys
239;00:17:54,723;00:17:56,691;and fighting the Mountain,
239;00:17:54,723;00:17:56,691;you'd have your britches down
240;00:17:56,725;00:17:58,059;and your cock out
240;00:17:56,725;00:17:58,059;before I could blink.
241;00:17:58,110;00:17:59,894;Does he frighten
241;00:17:58,110;00:17:59,894;you so much?
242;00:17:59,945;00:18:02,179;I'd be a bloody fool
242;00:17:59,945;00:18:02,179;if he didn't frighten me.
243;00:18:02,197;00:18:04,065;He's freakish big
243;00:18:02,197;00:18:04,065;and freakish strong.
244;00:18:04,116;00:18:06,901;And quicker than you'd expect
244;00:18:04,116;00:18:06,901;for a man of that size.
245;00:18:09,037;00:18:10,538;Maybe I could take him,
246;00:18:10,572;00:18:12,824;dance around
246;00:18:10,572;00:18:12,824;until he's so tired
247;00:18:12,858;00:18:14,592;of hacking at me,
247;00:18:12,858;00:18:14,592;he dropped his sword,
248;00:18:14,626;00:18:16,661;get him off
248;00:18:14,626;00:18:16,661;his feet somehow.
249;00:18:16,695;00:18:18,629;But one misstep...
250;00:18:18,664;00:18:20,364;...and I'm dead.
251;00:18:20,382;00:18:22,633;Why should I risk it?
252;00:18:22,668;00:18:25,169;Because you're my friend.
253;00:18:25,203;00:18:27,338;Aye, I'm your friend.
254;00:18:27,372;00:18:30,758;And when have you ever
254;00:18:27,372;00:18:30,758;risked your life for me?
255;00:18:40,569;00:18:41,936;I like you,
256;00:18:41,987;00:18:44,405;pampered little shit
256;00:18:41,987;00:18:44,405;that you are.
257;00:18:44,439;00:18:46,774;I just like myself more.
258;00:18:46,825;00:18:48,409;I understand.
259;00:18:48,443;00:18:50,111;I'm sorry it has
259;00:18:48,443;00:18:50,111;to be this way.
260;00:18:50,162;00:18:51,779;Why are you sorry?
261;00:18:51,830;00:18:53,865;Because you're
261;00:18:51,830;00:18:53,865;an evil bastard
262;00:18:53,899;00:18:55,833;with no conscience
262;00:18:53,899;00:18:55,833;and no heart?
263;00:18:55,868;00:18:58,536;That's what I liked about
263;00:18:55,868;00:18:58,536;you in the first place.
264;00:19:04,960;00:19:07,044;We had some
264;00:19:04,960;00:19:07,044;good days together.
265;00:19:07,078;00:19:08,880;Yes, we did.
266;00:19:23,529;00:19:25,112;What will you do?
267;00:19:25,147;00:19:28,616;I suppose I'll have to kill
267;00:19:25,147;00:19:28,616;the Mountain myself.
268;00:19:30,369;00:19:32,570;Won't that make
268;00:19:30,369;00:19:32,570;for a great song?
269;00:19:35,607;00:19:38,409;I hope to hear
269;00:19:35,607;00:19:38,409;them sing it one day.
270;00:19:56,562;00:19:58,179;How did you get in here?
271;00:19:58,230;00:19:59,847;Your door is well guarded,
272;00:19:59,898;00:20:02,016;but your window is not.
273;00:20:08,323;00:20:11,359;I swam to an island
273;00:20:08,323;00:20:11,359;a mile offshore for these.
274;00:20:11,410;00:20:13,911;Don't do that again.
275;00:20:15,280;00:20:17,865;Never met a woman who
275;00:20:15,280;00:20:17,865;didn't like wildflowers.
276;00:20:17,916;00:20:20,334;These are my
276;00:20:17,916;00:20:20,334;private quarters.
277;00:20:20,369;00:20:22,920;If I want you here,
277;00:20:20,369;00:20:22,920;I will summon you.
278;00:20:24,423;00:20:27,341;Forgive me, my queen.
278;00:20:24,423;00:20:27,341;I live to serve you.
279;00:20:33,465;00:20:35,633;Tell me why you're here.
280;00:20:39,638;00:20:41,539;I came to ask a favor.
281;00:20:41,607;00:20:43,891;I only have two talents
281;00:20:41,607;00:20:43,891;in this world--
282;00:20:43,942;00:20:46,277;war and women.
283;00:20:46,311;00:20:48,980;You are staying here
283;00:20:46,311;00:20:48,980;in Meereen to rule.
284;00:20:49,014;00:20:51,198;That is a wise decision.
284;00:20:49,014;00:20:51,198;I respect it.
285;00:20:51,233;00:20:53,117;But here in Meereen,
285;00:20:51,233;00:20:53,117;I cannot pursue my talents.
286;00:20:53,151;00:20:55,786;I've ordered the Second Sons
286;00:20:53,151;00:20:55,786;to patrol the streets
287;00:20:55,821;00:20:57,538;to stop
287;00:20:55,821;00:20:57,538;the revenge killing.
288;00:20:57,572;00:20:58,856;You've ordered us
288;00:20:57,572;00:20:58,856;to be night watchmen.
289;00:20:58,874;00:21:00,825;And as for women,
290;00:21:00,859;00:21:04,578;there are thousands
290;00:21:00,859;00:21:04,578;in Meereen you can pursue.
291;00:21:05,580;00:21:07,381;There is only one,
292;00:21:07,416;00:21:10,051;and she does not
292;00:21:07,416;00:21:10,051;want me.
293;00:21:11,586;00:21:12,887;You swore me your sword.
294;00:21:12,921;00:21:15,506;My sword is yours
294;00:21:12,921;00:21:15,506;till the day I die.
295;00:21:15,540;00:21:17,675;So if I command you
295;00:21:15,540;00:21:17,675;to stay in Meereen
296;00:21:17,726;00:21:19,176;and patrol the streets?
297;00:21:19,210;00:21:21,896;I'll stay in Meereen
297;00:21:19,210;00:21:21,896;and patrol the streets.
298;00:21:21,930;00:21:24,415;Send me to kill
298;00:21:21,930;00:21:24,415;your enemies.
299;00:21:24,449;00:21:26,734;Any enemy anywhere.
300;00:21:27,819;00:21:30,321;Let me do
300;00:21:27,819;00:21:30,321;what I do best.
301;00:21:31,723;00:21:33,524;Very well.
302;00:21:39,564;00:21:41,582;Do what you do best.
303;00:21:52,427;00:21:54,628;Take off your clothes.
304;00:22:23,775;00:22:25,376;Oh.
305;00:22:26,611;00:22:28,629;Come in, my queen.
305;00:22:26,611;00:22:28,629;Please.
306;00:22:28,663;00:22:30,614;I didn't mean
306;00:22:28,663;00:22:30,614;to disturb you, my lady.
307;00:22:30,632;00:22:32,133;You could never
307;00:22:30,632;00:22:32,133;disturb me.
308;00:22:32,167;00:22:34,552;I just wanted to speak
308;00:22:32,167;00:22:34,552;with you before we left.
309;00:22:34,586;00:22:37,421;Could you bring me
309;00:22:34,586;00:22:37,421;that vial over there?
310;00:22:40,291;00:22:41,892;The blue one.
311;00:22:43,812;00:22:46,430;No, no, no.
311;00:22:43,812;00:22:46,430;Not that one.
312;00:22:46,464;00:22:48,649;You don't even want
312;00:22:46,464;00:22:48,649;to touch that one.
313;00:22:48,683;00:22:50,851;Next to it.
314;00:22:50,902;00:22:52,903;That's the one.
315;00:23:11,540;00:23:13,591;When I looked into
315;00:23:11,540;00:23:13,591;the flames this morning,
316;00:23:13,625;00:23:15,843;the Lord spoke to me.
317;00:23:15,877;00:23:17,762;He said,
318;00:23:17,796;00:23:22,266;Tonight, you will have your
318;00:23:17,796;00:23:22,266;last good bath in a long while.
319;00:23:22,300;00:23:24,518;Make it count.
320;00:23:27,806;00:23:29,140;A joke.
321;00:23:31,059;00:23:32,943;Not a very good one,
321;00:23:31,059;00:23:32,943;I'm afraid.
322;00:23:32,978;00:23:34,812;It was. I--
323;00:23:34,846;00:23:37,481;humor isn't my strength.
324;00:23:37,515;00:23:39,150;That's because
324;00:23:37,515;00:23:39,150;most jokes are lies
325;00:23:39,184;00:23:41,869;and you're devoted
325;00:23:39,184;00:23:41,869;to the truth.
326;00:23:41,903;00:23:45,156;If they're lies, my lady,
326;00:23:41,903;00:23:45,156;aren't they best avoided?
327;00:23:45,190;00:23:47,658;Not always.
328;00:23:57,035;00:23:59,220;Most of these powders
328;00:23:57,035;00:23:59,220;and potions
329;00:23:59,254;00:24:00,871;are lies.
330;00:24:00,889;00:24:05,426;Deceptions to make men think
330;00:24:00,889;00:24:05,426;they witnessed our Lord's power.
331;00:24:05,477;00:24:08,929;Once they step into his light, they
331;00:24:05,477;00:24:08,929;will see the lie for what it was--
332;00:24:08,980;00:24:12,266;a trick that led them
332;00:24:08,980;00:24:12,266;to the truth.
333;00:24:12,317;00:24:15,069;A pinch of this powder
333;00:24:12,317;00:24:15,069;in a bonfire
334;00:24:15,103;00:24:18,355;will send a flaming column
334;00:24:15,103;00:24:18,355;screaming towards the sky.
335;00:24:18,389;00:24:21,158;And this one creates
335;00:24:18,389;00:24:21,158;a black smoke
336;00:24:21,193;00:24:23,611;that will make the bravest
336;00:24:21,193;00:24:23,611;man piss himself with fear.
337;00:24:23,662;00:24:27,081;And a drop of this
337;00:24:23,662;00:24:27,081;in any man's wine
338;00:24:27,115;00:24:29,416;will drive him
338;00:24:27,115;00:24:29,416;wild with lust.
339;00:24:32,737;00:24:34,872;Did you use it
339;00:24:32,737;00:24:34,872;with Stannis?
340;00:24:34,906;00:24:36,257;No.
341;00:24:39,010;00:24:40,577;Don't be upset.
342;00:24:40,595;00:24:43,797;Men never crave
342;00:24:40,595;00:24:43,797;what they already have.
343;00:24:45,634;00:24:47,584;It's only flesh.
344;00:24:47,602;00:24:50,221;It needs
344;00:24:47,602;00:24:50,221;what it needs.
345;00:24:53,525;00:24:56,443;No act done in service
345;00:24:53,525;00:24:56,443;of the Lord
346;00:24:56,478;00:24:59,280;can ever be called a sin.
347;00:24:59,314;00:25:02,766;I thank God every day
347;00:24:59,314;00:25:02,766;for bringing you to us.
348;00:25:02,784;00:25:05,369;And Stannis to you.
349;00:25:05,403;00:25:09,907;He wants to bring
349;00:25:05,403;00:25:09,907;Shireen with us.
350;00:25:11,159;00:25:14,378;I think that would be
350;00:25:11,159;00:25:14,378;ill-advised.
351;00:25:14,412;00:25:18,048;My daughter has heretical
351;00:25:14,412;00:25:18,048;tendencies, as you're well aware.
352;00:25:18,083;00:25:21,886;I don't know if her doubt is real
352;00:25:18,083;00:25:21,886;or simply meant to spite me,
353;00:25:21,920;00:25:25,306;but whichever the case,
353;00:25:21,920;00:25:25,306;she should stay home.
354;00:25:29,594;00:25:31,612;I understand
354;00:25:29,594;00:25:31,612;how you feel.
355;00:25:31,646;00:25:33,013;Hmm.
356;00:25:33,064;00:25:35,266;But that
356;00:25:33,064;00:25:35,266;is impossible.
357;00:25:38,069;00:25:40,104;Why?
358;00:25:40,138;00:25:43,974;You don't need powders
358;00:25:40,138;00:25:43,974;and potions, my queen.
359;00:25:43,992;00:25:46,143;You don't need lies.
360;00:25:46,161;00:25:49,646;You are strong enough to
360;00:25:46,161;00:25:49,646;look into the Lord's light
361;00:25:49,664;00:25:51,999;and see his truth
361;00:25:49,664;00:25:51,999;for yourself.
362;00:25:57,756;00:25:59,957;However harsh it is.
363;00:25:59,991;00:26:02,459;However hard for us
363;00:25:59,991;00:26:02,459;to understand.
364;00:26:04,162;00:26:05,546;You don't need my help,
365;00:26:05,597;00:26:08,382;but I will need yours soon.
366;00:26:08,433;00:26:11,468;When we set sail, your
366;00:26:08,433;00:26:11,468;daughter must be with us.
367;00:26:15,006;00:26:17,141;The Lord needs her.
368;00:26:24,482;00:26:26,867;Jorah the Andal.
369;00:26:28,019;00:26:30,204;Are you here
369;00:26:28,019;00:26:30,204;to see our queen?
370;00:26:31,957;00:26:34,041;She's in a good mood.
371;00:26:48,706;00:26:51,008;Khaleesi.
372;00:26:51,042;00:26:53,427;You're here early.
372;00:26:51,042;00:26:53,427;Later than some.
373;00:26:55,730;00:26:57,214;You don't approve?
374;00:26:57,233;00:26:59,650;It's not a question of approval,
374;00:26:57,233;00:26:59,650;it's a question of trust.
375;00:26:59,684;00:27:02,019;You neither
375;00:26:59,684;00:27:02,019;approve nor trust.
376;00:27:02,053;00:27:03,654;Why would I?
376;00:27:02,053;00:27:03,654;The man's a sellsword.
377;00:27:03,688;00:27:05,222;Didn't you fight for
377;00:27:03,688;00:27:05,222;the Golden Company
378;00:27:05,240;00:27:06,774;before pledging
378;00:27:05,240;00:27:06,774;your sword to my brother?
379;00:27:06,825;00:27:08,492;I did.
380;00:27:08,526;00:27:09,943;I trust you.
381;00:27:09,995;00:27:12,446;Daario Naharis
381;00:27:09,995;00:27:12,446;killed his captains
382;00:27:12,497;00:27:15,666;and dumped their heads at your feet
382;00:27:12,497;00:27:15,666;when he grew tired of their commands.
383;00:27:15,700;00:27:18,202;How could you ever have
383;00:27:15,700;00:27:18,202;faith in a man like that?
384;00:27:18,236;00:27:21,588;I could never have faith
384;00:27:18,236;00:27:21,588;in a man like Daario.
385;00:27:23,124;00:27:25,759;That's why I've sent him and the
385;00:27:23,124;00:27:25,759;Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
386;00:27:27,912;00:27:30,014;You have?
386;00:27:27,912;00:27:30,014;I have.
387;00:27:30,048;00:27:32,099;Without you there
387;00:27:30,048;00:27:32,099;to rule, Khaleesi,
388;00:27:32,133;00:27:34,418;I fear the masters
388;00:27:32,133;00:27:34,418;will simply bide their time,
389;00:27:34,436;00:27:36,687;wait for the invaders
389;00:27:34,436;00:27:36,687;to leave and reassert control.
390;00:27:36,721;00:27:40,858;That is why I've ordered Daario to
390;00:27:36,721;00:27:40,858;execute every master in Yunkai.
391;00:27:42,277;00:27:44,862;The masters tear babies
391;00:27:42,277;00:27:44,862;from their mothers' arms.
392;00:27:44,896;00:27:47,364;They mutilate little boys
392;00:27:44,896;00:27:47,364;by the thousands.
393;00:27:47,399;00:27:49,783;They train little girls in the
393;00:27:47,399;00:27:49,783;art of pleasuring old men.
394;00:27:49,818;00:27:52,953;They treat men like beasts,
394;00:27:49,818;00:27:52,953;as you said yourself.
395;00:27:52,987;00:27:56,540;Herding the masters into pens and
395;00:27:52,987;00:27:56,540;slaughtering them by the thousands
396;00:27:56,574;00:27:58,575;is also treating men
396;00:27:56,574;00:27:58,575;like beasts.
397;00:27:58,609;00:28:00,744;The slaves you freed,
398;00:28:00,795;00:28:02,913;brutality is all
398;00:28:00,795;00:28:02,913;they've ever known.
399;00:28:02,947;00:28:05,049;If you want them to know
399;00:28:02,947;00:28:05,049;something else,
400;00:28:05,083;00:28:06,450;you'll have
400;00:28:05,083;00:28:06,450;to show it to them.
401;00:28:06,468;00:28:08,552;And repay the slavers
401;00:28:06,468;00:28:08,552;with what? Kindness?
402;00:28:08,586;00:28:10,087;A fine?
402;00:28:08,586;00:28:10,087;A stern warning?
403;00:28:10,121;00:28:13,257;It's tempting to see your
403;00:28:10,121;00:28:13,257;enemies as evil, all of them,
404;00:28:13,291;00:28:16,009;but there's good and evil on both
404;00:28:13,291;00:28:16,009;sides in every war ever fought.
405;00:28:16,061;00:28:18,512;Let the priests argue
405;00:28:16,061;00:28:18,512;over good and evil.
406;00:28:18,563;00:28:20,097;Slavery is real.
407;00:28:20,131;00:28:22,349;I can end it.
407;00:28:20,131;00:28:22,349;I will end it.
408;00:28:22,400;00:28:24,685;And I will end
408;00:28:22,400;00:28:24,685;those behind it.
409;00:28:24,736;00:28:26,920;I sold men
409;00:28:24,736;00:28:26,920;into slavery, Khaleesi.
410;00:28:26,955;00:28:31,808;And now you are helping me
410;00:28:26,955;00:28:31,808;show them to freedom.
411;00:28:31,826;00:28:35,195;I wouldn't be here to help you
411;00:28:31,826;00:28:35,195;if Ned Stark had done to me
412;00:28:35,246;00:28:38,082;what you want to do
412;00:28:35,246;00:28:38,082;to the masters of Yunkai.
413;00:28:42,620;00:28:45,506;The man who came to me the other
413;00:28:42,620;00:28:45,506;day about burying his father.
414;00:28:45,540;00:28:47,624;Hizdahr zo Loraq?
415;00:28:47,658;00:28:50,344;He will accompany
415;00:28:47,658;00:28:50,344;the Second Sons
416;00:28:50,378;00:28:52,329;and serve as my
416;00:28:50,378;00:28:52,329;ambassador to Yunkai.
417;00:28:52,347;00:28:55,332;He will tell the masters
417;00:28:52,347;00:28:55,332;what has happened in Meereen.
418;00:28:55,350;00:28:58,936;He will explain the choice
418;00:28:55,350;00:28:58,936;they have before them.
419;00:28:58,970;00:29:00,888;They can live
419;00:28:58,970;00:29:00,888;in my new world
420;00:29:00,939;00:29:03,974;or they can die
420;00:29:00,939;00:29:03,974;in their old one.
421;00:29:08,113;00:29:10,564;Well, go and catch Daario
421;00:29:08,113;00:29:10,564;before he leaves.
422;00:29:10,615;00:29:12,483;Tell him
422;00:29:10,615;00:29:12,483;I changed my mind.
423;00:29:12,517;00:29:14,868;Yes, Khaleesi.
424;00:29:20,125;00:29:21,825;No.
425;00:29:24,712;00:29:27,414;Tell him you
425;00:29:24,712;00:29:27,414;changed my mind.
426;00:29:38,159;00:29:41,078;Rat cunts.
427;00:29:42,514;00:29:44,815;Fucking whore.
428;00:29:46,684;00:29:48,352;You're doing it wrong.
429;00:29:48,386;00:29:51,321;You need to burn away
429;00:29:48,386;00:29:51,321;that horrible bit there.
430;00:29:51,356;00:29:54,074;Otherwise it's gonna
430;00:29:51,356;00:29:54,074;get infected and fester.
431;00:29:56,561;00:29:59,530;I know you don't like fire,
431;00:29:56,561;00:29:59,530;but if you don't do it right--
432;00:29:59,564;00:30:01,498;No fire.
433;00:30:02,584;00:30:04,785;It'll only take a second.
434;00:30:04,836;00:30:07,204;It won't hurt that much.
434;00:30:04,836;00:30:07,204;No fire!
435;00:30:21,919;00:30:23,887;Shut up about it.
436;00:30:26,608;00:30:28,642;Shut up about everything.
437;00:30:28,693;00:30:31,361;Thanks to you,
437;00:30:28,693;00:30:31,361;I'm a walking bag of silver
438;00:30:31,396;00:30:33,647;anywhere the Lannisters
438;00:30:31,396;00:30:33,647;hold sway.
439;00:30:35,366;00:30:37,201;Which is everywhere
439;00:30:35,366;00:30:37,201;between where we are now
440;00:30:37,235;00:30:39,236;and where we're going.
441;00:30:41,772;00:30:44,908;I'm as stupid as that hog
441;00:30:41,772;00:30:44,908;you stuck back in the village,
442;00:30:44,942;00:30:49,079;getting myself cut
442;00:30:44,942;00:30:49,079;and stabbed and bitten.
443;00:30:51,633;00:30:54,001;No reward is worth
443;00:30:51,633;00:30:54,001;this much trouble.
444;00:30:54,052;00:30:56,970;Wish I'd never
444;00:30:54,052;00:30:56,970;laid eyes on you.
445;00:31:07,232;00:31:10,234;You say your brother
445;00:31:07,232;00:31:10,234;gave you that sword.
446;00:31:12,604;00:31:14,655;My brother gave me this.
447;00:31:16,658;00:31:18,909;It was just like you said
447;00:31:16,658;00:31:18,909;a while back.
448;00:31:18,943;00:31:20,744;Pressed me to the fire
449;00:31:20,778;00:31:23,664;like I was a nice
449;00:31:20,778;00:31:23,664;juicy mutton chop.
450;00:31:26,751;00:31:28,452;Why?
451;00:31:28,486;00:31:30,337;Thought I stole
451;00:31:28,486;00:31:30,337;one of his toys.
452;00:31:30,371;00:31:32,956;I didn't steal it. I was
452;00:31:30,371;00:31:32,956;just playing with it.
453;00:31:37,845;00:31:39,829;The pain was bad.
454;00:31:39,847;00:31:41,882;The smell was worse.
455;00:31:44,969;00:31:49,222;But the worst thing was that
455;00:31:44,969;00:31:49,222;it was my brother who did it.
456;00:31:53,361;00:31:56,313;My father,
456;00:31:53,361;00:31:56,313;who protected him...
457;00:31:58,283;00:32:00,984;told everyone my bedding
457;00:31:58,283;00:32:00,984;caught fire.
458;00:32:13,665;00:32:16,083;You think
458;00:32:13,665;00:32:16,083;you're on your own?
459;00:32:19,003;00:32:20,704;Let me wash it out
460;00:32:20,722;00:32:22,973;and help you
460;00:32:20,722;00:32:22,973;sew it up at least.
461;00:32:49,584;00:32:51,868;Bit of comfort
461;00:32:49,584;00:32:51,868;never hurt anyone.
462;00:32:51,902;00:32:54,087;We've been sleeping in
462;00:32:51,902;00:32:54,087;ditches the last few weeks.
463;00:32:54,122;00:32:56,957;I think we can treat ourselves
463;00:32:54,122;00:32:56,957;to a featherbed for the night
464;00:32:57,008;00:32:59,876;and a hot meal
464;00:32:57,008;00:32:59,876;not cooked by you.
465;00:32:59,927;00:33:01,378;Couldn't agree
465;00:32:59,927;00:33:01,378;more, my lady.
466;00:33:01,412;00:33:03,296;Just don't start expecting
466;00:33:01,412;00:33:03,296;silk underclothes.
467;00:33:03,348;00:33:05,582;Not working for your
467;00:33:03,348;00:33:05,582;former lord any longer.
468;00:33:05,600;00:33:07,884;Yes, my lady.
468;00:33:05,600;00:33:07,884;Don't get drunk.
469;00:33:09,604;00:33:10,721;No, my lady.
470;00:33:10,755;00:33:12,222;Can I get you
470;00:33:10,755;00:33:12,222;anything else?
471;00:33:12,256;00:33:14,024;No, this will do
471;00:33:12,256;00:33:14,024;nicely, thank you.
472;00:33:14,058;00:33:15,592;Kidney pie is wonderful.
473;00:33:15,610;00:33:17,561;Thanks.
474;00:33:17,595;00:33:19,780;I do my best.
475;00:33:21,432;00:33:23,984;A good kidney pie is all
475;00:33:21,432;00:33:23,984;about the ingredients.
476;00:33:24,035;00:33:26,987;Flour, lard, water,
476;00:33:24,035;00:33:26,987;eggs, milk.
477;00:33:27,038;00:33:28,822;Easy enough.
477;00:33:27,038;00:33:28,822;But the meat,
478;00:33:28,873;00:33:31,825;peacetime or not, getting your
478;00:33:28,873;00:33:31,825;hands on a good bottom round steak
479;00:33:31,876;00:33:33,543;and calves' kidneys
479;00:33:31,876;00:33:33,543;is not easy.
480;00:33:33,578;00:33:36,129;I mean, some people settle
480;00:33:33,578;00:33:36,129;for plain old beef kidneys.
481;00:33:36,164;00:33:38,448;Got no right to cook
481;00:33:36,164;00:33:38,448;anything, them.
482;00:33:38,467;00:33:40,050;Oh, and the gravy.
483;00:33:40,084;00:33:41,918;Don't get me started
483;00:33:40,084;00:33:41,918;on the gravy.
484;00:33:41,952;00:33:43,303;Very difficult
484;00:33:41,952;00:33:43,303;to get right.
485;00:33:43,337;00:33:45,138;See, a lot of people
485;00:33:43,337;00:33:45,138;give up on the gravy.
486;00:33:45,173;00:33:47,391;You cannot give up
486;00:33:45,173;00:33:47,391;on the gravy.
487;00:33:47,425;00:33:48,975;No gravy, no pie.
488;00:33:49,010;00:33:51,428;Simple as that.
489;00:33:51,462;00:33:54,765;That's nice armor.
489;00:33:51,462;00:33:54,765;Are you a knight?
490;00:33:56,901;00:33:58,351;No.
491;00:33:58,403;00:34:01,521;Oh, it's just people with
491;00:33:58,403;00:34:01,521;armor are usually knights.
492;00:34:01,572;00:34:04,241;Generally speaking. From King's
492;00:34:01,572;00:34:04,241;Landing, though, aren't you?
493;00:34:04,275;00:34:07,110;From there myself originally.
493;00:34:04,275;00:34:07,110;Flea Bottom born and bred.
494;00:34:07,144;00:34:08,945;What brings you
494;00:34:07,144;00:34:08,945;to these parts?
495;00:34:08,979;00:34:10,980;We're looking
495;00:34:08,979;00:34:10,980;for someone.
496;00:34:10,998;00:34:13,450;Someone in particular?
496;00:34:10,998;00:34:13,450;Maybe they came in here.
497;00:34:13,484;00:34:15,819;A lot of people come in here.
497;00:34:13,484;00:34:15,819;Just the other day we had 17--
498;00:34:15,837;00:34:17,788;A girl, tall, red hair,
498;00:34:15,837;00:34:17,788;very pretty.
499;00:34:17,822;00:34:21,324;Her name is Sansa Stark, but she
499;00:34:17,822;00:34:21,324;may be using a different name.
500;00:34:21,342;00:34:23,293;Starks?
501;00:34:26,431;00:34:29,299;What, like them lot
501;00:34:26,431;00:34:29,299;from Winterhell?
502;00:34:32,720;00:34:34,855;No, ain't seen
502;00:34:32,720;00:34:34,855;anyone like that.
503;00:34:34,889;00:34:36,640;I heard they was
503;00:34:34,889;00:34:36,640;all traitors.
504;00:34:36,674;00:34:38,975;Don't need
504;00:34:36,674;00:34:38,975;no traitors in here.
505;00:34:39,009;00:34:42,345;I pledged my life to
505;00:34:39,009;00:34:42,345;their mother Catelyn Stark.
506;00:34:42,363;00:34:44,581;I swore to her I'd bring
506;00:34:42,363;00:34:44,581;her daughters home.
507;00:34:49,019;00:34:51,538;Sure I can't get you
507;00:34:49,019;00:34:51,538;a bit more kidney pie?
508;00:35:05,703;00:35:06,837;What?
509;00:35:06,871;00:35:08,472;It's nothing, my lady.
510;00:35:08,506;00:35:11,842;You wouldn't be screwing your face
510;00:35:08,506;00:35:11,842;up like that if it was nothing.
511;00:35:11,876;00:35:14,344;Don't want to offend, my lady.
511;00:35:11,876;00:35:14,344;Truly, I don't.
512;00:35:14,378;00:35:16,179;You're not interesting
512;00:35:14,378;00:35:16,179;enough to be offensive.
513;00:35:17,982;00:35:20,267;The Lannisters
513;00:35:17,982;00:35:20,267;want Lady Sansa.
514;00:35:20,318;00:35:22,986;The Lannisters
514;00:35:20,318;00:35:22,986;have money.
515;00:35:23,020;00:35:24,821;People kill for money.
516;00:35:26,056;00:35:27,908;I don't think we should
516;00:35:26,056;00:35:27,908;be telling people
517;00:35:27,942;00:35:29,526;we're searching
517;00:35:27,942;00:35:29,526;for Lady Sansa.
518;00:35:39,287;00:35:42,238;My lady. My lord.
518;00:35:39,287;00:35:42,238;Could I have a word?
519;00:35:42,256;00:35:44,207;What about?
519;00:35:42,256;00:35:44,207;Not kidney pie.
520;00:35:44,241;00:35:45,792;You seem
520;00:35:44,241;00:35:45,792;like a proper lady.
521;00:35:45,843;00:35:48,261;Someone who could
521;00:35:45,843;00:35:48,261;be trusted.
522;00:35:50,264;00:35:52,415;I never met no Sansa Stark.
523;00:35:52,433;00:35:54,518;But I know her sister...
524;00:35:54,552;00:35:56,386;Arya.
525;00:35:58,523;00:36:02,142;No one's seen Arya Stark since
525;00:35:58,523;00:36:02,142;her father was beheaded.
526;00:36:02,193;00:36:04,995;She's presumed dead.
527;00:36:05,029;00:36:06,947;She weren't when I last
527;00:36:05,029;00:36:06,947;spoke to her.
528;00:36:06,981;00:36:09,366;When was that? - Heading up
528;00:36:06,981;00:36:09,366;north with the Night's Watch.
529;00:36:09,400;00:36:10,901;She was all dressed up
529;00:36:09,400;00:36:10,901;as a boy.
530;00:36:10,935;00:36:13,770;Like your ladyship,
530;00:36:10,935;00:36:13,770;only without the armor.
531;00:36:13,788;00:36:15,622;Going by the name Arry.
532;00:36:15,656;00:36:17,440;So what happened to her?
532;00:36:15,656;00:36:17,440;Well--
533;00:36:17,475;00:36:19,626;The quick version.
534;00:36:19,660;00:36:21,494;The Lannisters
534;00:36:19,660;00:36:21,494;took us prisoner.
535;00:36:21,546;00:36:23,380;We escaped.
536;00:36:23,414;00:36:25,615;The Brotherhood took
536;00:36:23,414;00:36:25,615;us prisoner.
537;00:36:25,633;00:36:27,116;They sold me
537;00:36:25,633;00:36:27,116;to the innkeep.
538;00:36:27,134;00:36:29,719;They were gonna sell Arya
538;00:36:27,134;00:36:29,719;to her mother at Riverrun
539;00:36:29,754;00:36:31,054;along with another prisoner.
540;00:36:31,088;00:36:32,973;Big ugly fellow.
540;00:36:31,088;00:36:32,973;Foul mouth
541;00:36:33,007;00:36:35,008;and a face like
541;00:36:33,007;00:36:35,008;a half-burnt ham.
542;00:36:35,059;00:36:36,977;Not friendly.
542;00:36:35,059;00:36:36,977;The Hound.
543;00:36:37,012;00:36:38,795;That's the one.
544;00:36:38,813;00:36:42,131;If you find her,
544;00:36:38,813;00:36:42,131;could you give her this?
545;00:36:42,149;00:36:43,967;She liked the last one
545;00:36:42,149;00:36:43,967;I gave her,
546;00:36:43,985;00:36:46,319;but, well, this one
546;00:36:43,985;00:36:46,319;turned out better.
547;00:36:55,913;00:36:58,615;Um, you were saying?
548;00:37:02,670;00:37:05,372;Her mother's dead,
548;00:37:02,670;00:37:05,372;grandfather's dead,
549;00:37:05,423;00:37:07,791;Walder Frey is
549;00:37:05,423;00:37:07,791;the new lord of Riverrun.
550;00:37:07,825;00:37:09,676;The Brotherhood
550;00:37:07,825;00:37:09,676;isn't going to Riverrun.
551;00:37:09,710;00:37:11,661;They'll take her
551;00:37:09,710;00:37:11,661;to the Eyrie, my lady.
552;00:37:11,679;00:37:13,496;Why the Eyrie?
553;00:37:13,514;00:37:15,999;Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.
554;00:37:16,017;00:37:18,101;Catelyn Stark's sister.
555;00:37:18,135;00:37:21,170;She's Arya's last living
555;00:37:18,135;00:37:21,170;relative with money.
556;00:37:21,188;00:37:23,940;She hates the Lannisters.
557;00:37:26,027;00:37:28,228;Lord Tyrion
557;00:37:26,027;00:37:28,228;made sure I knew
558;00:37:28,279;00:37:31,364;which house married which
558;00:37:28,279;00:37:31,364;and who hated who.
559;00:37:31,399;00:37:33,116;Sansa could
559;00:37:31,399;00:37:33,116;be there, too.
560;00:37:33,150;00:37:35,619;Aye, my lady.
561;00:37:35,653;00:37:37,320;Could be.
562;00:37:43,744;00:37:45,662;You sure about this?
563;00:37:48,966;00:37:50,550;No.
564;00:38:21,615;00:38:24,501;I imagined you'd be back
564;00:38:21,615;00:38:24,501;at the brothel at this hour.
565;00:38:24,535;00:38:29,255;I did spend some time with an absolutely
565;00:38:24,535;00:38:29,255;stunning blonde the other day.
566;00:38:29,290;00:38:32,108;Mm, do tell.
567;00:38:32,143;00:38:35,545;I've got every kind
567;00:38:32,143;00:38:35,545;of filth down here
568;00:38:35,579;00:38:37,097;except the kind I like.
569;00:38:37,131;00:38:39,132;Your sister.
570;00:38:39,183;00:38:41,384;Oh.
571;00:38:47,224;00:38:49,976;Cersei approached me.
572;00:38:51,278;00:38:53,330;We spoke a great deal
572;00:38:51,278;00:38:53,330;about her daughter.
573;00:38:53,364;00:38:56,449;How worried your sister
573;00:38:53,364;00:38:56,449;is about her.
574;00:38:56,484;00:38:59,402;She was trying
574;00:38:56,484;00:38:59,402;very hard to pretend
575;00:38:59,437;00:39:01,438;she had not come
575;00:38:59,437;00:39:01,438;to sway me against you.
576;00:39:01,472;00:39:03,773;I think she may have even
576;00:39:01,472;00:39:03,773;believed it herself.
577;00:39:03,791;00:39:06,826;Making honest feelings
577;00:39:03,791;00:39:06,826;do dishonest work
578;00:39:06,877;00:39:09,295;is one of her many gifts.
579;00:39:09,330;00:39:12,332;It was difficult for her
579;00:39:09,330;00:39:12,332;to hide her true intentions.
580;00:39:13,501;00:39:17,137;It is rare
580;00:39:13,501;00:39:17,137;to meet a Lannister
581;00:39:17,171;00:39:21,174;who shares my enthusiasm
581;00:39:17,171;00:39:21,174;for dead Lannisters.
582;00:39:23,644;00:39:25,762;She desperately wants
582;00:39:23,644;00:39:25,762;to see you killed.
583;00:39:25,796;00:39:27,981;She didn't need
583;00:39:25,796;00:39:27,981;to bother you.
584;00:39:28,015;00:39:31,818;It looks as though I've
584;00:39:28,015;00:39:31,818;taken care of that myself.
585;00:39:31,852;00:39:34,437;The joy she will feel
586;00:39:34,471;00:39:37,023;when my head
586;00:39:34,471;00:39:37,023;leaves my neck.
587;00:39:37,108;00:39:40,310;She's wanted this
587;00:39:37,108;00:39:40,310;for a long time.
588;00:39:40,344;00:39:43,146;Yes, I know.
589;00:39:43,164;00:39:46,166;We met, you and I.
590;00:39:46,200;00:39:47,817;Many years ago.
591;00:39:47,835;00:39:50,787;I think I would
591;00:39:47,835;00:39:50,787;have remembered that.
592;00:39:50,821;00:39:54,124;Unlikely.
592;00:39:50,821;00:39:54,124;You had just been born.
593;00:39:56,627;00:39:59,095;Our father brought me
593;00:39:56,627;00:39:59,095;and my sister Elia with him
594;00:39:59,130;00:40:00,830;on a visit
594;00:39:59,130;00:40:00,830;to Casterly Rock.
595;00:40:00,848;00:40:02,832;My first time
595;00:40:00,848;00:40:02,832;away from Dorne.
596;00:40:02,850;00:40:05,218;I didn't like anything
596;00:40:02,850;00:40:05,218;about the Rock.
597;00:40:06,771;00:40:09,189;Not the food,
597;00:40:06,771;00:40:09,189;not the weather,
598;00:40:09,223;00:40:10,890;not your accents.
599;00:40:10,941;00:40:12,559;Nothing.
600;00:40:13,978;00:40:16,512;But the biggest
600;00:40:13,978;00:40:16,512;disappointment...
601;00:40:16,530;00:40:18,815;you.
602;00:40:20,684;00:40:23,653;You and my family have more in
602;00:40:20,684;00:40:23,653;common than you might admit.
603;00:40:23,687;00:40:25,872;The whole way from Dorne
604;00:40:25,906;00:40:28,741;all anyone talked about
604;00:40:25,906;00:40:28,741;was the monster
605;00:40:28,793;00:40:31,744;that had been born
605;00:40:28,793;00:40:31,744;to Tywin Lannister.
606;00:40:31,796;00:40:34,664;A head twice
606;00:40:31,796;00:40:34,664;the size of his body,
607;00:40:34,698;00:40:36,583;a tail between his legs,
608;00:40:36,634;00:40:38,718;claws, one red eye,
609;00:40:38,752;00:40:41,671;the privates of both
609;00:40:38,752;00:40:41,671;a girl and a boy.
610;00:40:41,705;00:40:43,640;That would have made
610;00:40:41,705;00:40:43,640;things so much easier.
611;00:40:43,674;00:40:47,543;When we met your sister, she
611;00:40:43,674;00:40:47,543;promised she would show you to us.
612;00:40:47,561;00:40:49,212;Every day we would ask.
613;00:40:49,230;00:40:51,681;Every day she would
613;00:40:49,230;00:40:51,681;say, Soon.
614;00:40:51,715;00:40:55,018;Then she and your brother
615;00:40:55,052;00:40:58,404;took us
615;00:40:55,052;00:40:58,404;to your nursery and...
616;00:40:59,857;00:41:02,775;she unveiled the freak.
617;00:41:04,995;00:41:06,830;Your head
617;00:41:04,995;00:41:06,830;was a bit large.
618;00:41:06,864;00:41:08,765;Your arms and legs
618;00:41:06,864;00:41:08,765;were a bit small,
619;00:41:08,799;00:41:10,450;but no claw.
620;00:41:10,501;00:41:13,786;No red eye.
620;00:41:10,501;00:41:13,786;No tail between your legs.
621;00:41:13,838;00:41:16,206;Just a tiny pink cock.
622;00:41:16,240;00:41:19,008;We didn't try to hide
622;00:41:16,240;00:41:19,008;our disappointment.
623;00:41:19,076;00:41:21,461;That's not a monster,
623;00:41:19,076;00:41:21,461;I told Cersei.
624;00:41:21,512;00:41:24,514;That's just a baby.
625;00:41:26,016;00:41:28,635;And she said,
625;00:41:26,016;00:41:28,635;He killed my mother.
626;00:41:28,686;00:41:31,187;And she pinched
626;00:41:28,686;00:41:31,187;your little cock so hard,
627;00:41:31,222;00:41:33,223;I thought she might
627;00:41:31,222;00:41:33,223;pull it off.
628;00:41:33,257;00:41:35,358;Until your brother
628;00:41:33,257;00:41:35,358;made her stop.
629;00:41:35,392;00:41:37,460;It doesn't matter,
629;00:41:35,392;00:41:37,460;she told us.
630;00:41:37,495;00:41:40,446;Everyone says
630;00:41:37,495;00:41:40,446;he will die soon.
631;00:41:40,481;00:41:42,115;I hope they are right.
632;00:41:42,149;00:41:44,817;He should not
632;00:41:42,149;00:41:44,817;have lived this long.
633;00:41:48,372;00:41:50,039;Well...
634;00:41:52,626;00:41:57,297;sooner or later, Cersei
634;00:41:52,626;00:41:57,297;always gets what she wants.
635;00:41:59,383;00:42:02,352;And what about
635;00:41:59,383;00:42:02,352;what I want?
636;00:42:04,688;00:42:06,923;Justice
637;00:42:06,957;00:42:10,560;for my sister
637;00:42:06,957;00:42:10,560;and her children.
638;00:42:10,594;00:42:12,595;If you want justice,
639;00:42:12,629;00:42:15,515;you've come
639;00:42:12,629;00:42:15,515;to the wrong place.
640;00:42:15,566;00:42:17,767;I disagree.
641;00:42:25,309;00:42:28,328;I've come to
641;00:42:25,309;00:42:28,328;the perfect place.
642;00:42:30,080;00:42:32,415;I want to bring those who
642;00:42:30,080;00:42:32,415;have wronged me to justice.
643;00:42:32,449;00:42:35,535;And all those who have
643;00:42:32,449;00:42:35,535;wronged me are right here.
644;00:42:37,871;00:42:40,089;I will begin with
644;00:42:37,871;00:42:40,089;Ser Gregor Clegane,
645;00:42:40,124;00:42:42,875;who killed
645;00:42:40,124;00:42:42,875;my sister's children
646;00:42:42,927;00:42:46,296;and then raped her with their
646;00:42:42,927;00:42:46,296;blood still on his hands
647;00:42:46,330;00:42:49,048;before killing her, too.
648;00:42:57,558;00:42:59,809;I will be your champion.
649;00:43:53,998;00:43:55,865;Hello, Robin.
650;00:43:58,452;00:43:59,786;What are you doing?
651;00:43:59,837;00:44:01,754;I'm building my home,
651;00:43:59,837;00:44:01,754;Winterfell.
652;00:44:01,789;00:44:03,840;At least I think I am.
653;00:44:03,874;00:44:06,542;I haven't been back there
653;00:44:03,874;00:44:06,542;in a very long time.
654;00:44:06,576;00:44:08,928;Why did you leave?
655;00:44:08,962;00:44:11,347;It's a long story.
656;00:44:13,017;00:44:14,583;I stay here in the Eyrie.
657;00:44:14,601;00:44:17,370;Mother says it's dangerous on the
657;00:44:14,601;00:44:17,370;roads and I have to keep myself safe
658;00:44:17,404;00:44:19,038;because I'm the Lord
658;00:44:17,404;00:44:19,038;of the Vale
659;00:44:19,073;00:44:21,391;and the Lord of the Vale
659;00:44:19,073;00:44:21,391;is a very important person.
660;00:44:21,425;00:44:23,726;Yes, you certainly are.
661;00:44:23,760;00:44:25,995;When will you go back?
662;00:44:26,030;00:44:28,731;Probably never.
663;00:44:28,765;00:44:30,867;My family doesn't
663;00:44:28,765;00:44:30,867;live there anymore
664;00:44:30,901;00:44:33,369;and someone
664;00:44:30,901;00:44:33,369;burned it down.
665;00:44:34,571;00:44:36,239;Oh.
666;00:44:36,273;00:44:39,042;Does Winterfell
666;00:44:36,273;00:44:39,042;have a Moon Door?
667;00:44:39,076;00:44:40,843;No, I'm afraid not.
668;00:44:40,878;00:44:42,995;It's not high up in the mountains.
668;00:44:40,878;00:44:42,995;It's down on the ground.
669;00:44:43,047;00:44:44,881;That sounds dangerous.
670;00:44:44,915;00:44:47,717;How do you make people fly?
670;00:44:44,915;00:44:47,717;We don't.
671;00:44:47,751;00:44:49,135;What do you do with
671;00:44:47,751;00:44:49,135;all the bad people
672;00:44:49,169;00:44:51,637;and the scary people
672;00:44:49,169;00:44:51,637;and the people you don't like?
673;00:44:51,672;00:44:53,222;I never did anything
673;00:44:51,672;00:44:53,222;with them at all.
674;00:44:53,257;00:44:55,892;Girls didn't take part
674;00:44:53,257;00:44:55,892;in that where I came from.
675;00:44:55,926;00:44:59,228;Well, I'm Lord
675;00:44:55,926;00:44:59,228;of the Vale.
676;00:44:59,263;00:45:02,565;When I grow up, I'll be able
676;00:44:59,263;00:45:02,565;to fly anybody who bothers me.
677;00:45:02,599;00:45:04,934;Or you.
677;00:45:02,599;00:45:04,934;When we get married,
678;00:45:04,968;00:45:06,736;you can tell me
678;00:45:04,968;00:45:06,736;if you don't like somebody
679;00:45:06,770;00:45:09,021;and then we can bring them
679;00:45:06,770;00:45:09,021;back here and, whoosh!
680;00:45:09,073;00:45:10,907;Right through
680;00:45:09,073;00:45:10,907;the Moon Door.
681;00:45:12,609;00:45:14,527;I like the sound of that.
682;00:45:14,578;00:45:16,312;Let's put a Moon Door
682;00:45:14,578;00:45:16,312;in your Winterfell.
683;00:45:16,330;00:45:17,780;All right.
684;00:45:17,814;00:45:19,782;It can go in here
684;00:45:17,814;00:45:19,782;in this big tower.
685;00:45:19,816;00:45:21,868;Careful.
685;00:45:19,816;00:45:21,868;You've ruined it.
686;00:45:21,919;00:45:23,336;Now I'm going to have
686;00:45:21,919;00:45:23,336;to rebuild the whole thing.
687;00:45:23,370;00:45:24,921;I didn't ruin it.
687;00:45:23,370;00:45:24,921;You did.
688;00:45:24,955;00:45:26,906;It was already ruined because
688;00:45:24,955;00:45:26,906;it didn't have a Moon Door.
689;00:45:26,940;00:45:28,291;I was fixing it.
690;00:45:28,325;00:45:29,658;Knocking things down
690;00:45:28,325;00:45:29,658;isn't fixing them.
691;00:45:29,676;00:45:31,461;It's ruining them.
691;00:45:29,676;00:45:31,461;I didn't ruin it!
692;00:45:31,495;00:45:33,963;You're being stupid.
692;00:45:31,495;00:45:33,963;I didn't ruin it!
693;00:45:44,324;00:45:47,059;Robin, I'm sorry, I--
694;00:45:48,045;00:45:49,695;Children.
695;00:45:52,232;00:45:55,684;I hit him.
695;00:45:52,232;00:45:55,684;Yes, I saw.
696;00:45:55,702;00:45:57,036;I shouldn't have done that.
697;00:45:57,070;00:46:00,189;No, his mother
697;00:45:57,070;00:46:00,189;should have
698;00:46:00,207;00:46:02,508;a long time ago.
699;00:46:02,543;00:46:05,912;Consider it a step
699;00:46:02,543;00:46:05,912;in the right direction.
700;00:46:07,381;00:46:09,081;If he tells Aunt Lysa...
701;00:46:09,133;00:46:11,501;Let me worry about
701;00:46:09,133;00:46:11,501;Aunt Lysa.
702;00:46:12,886;00:46:15,638;I was trying to remember
702;00:46:12,886;00:46:15,638;what everything looked like.
703;00:46:16,890;00:46:18,941;I'll never see it again.
704;00:46:20,677;00:46:23,729;A lot can happen
704;00:46:20,677;00:46:23,729;between now and never.
705;00:46:25,883;00:46:28,050;If you want to build
705;00:46:25,883;00:46:28,050;a better home,
706;00:46:28,068;00:46:30,903;first you must
706;00:46:28,068;00:46:30,903;demolish the old one.
707;00:46:32,889;00:46:35,942;Why did you really
707;00:46:32,889;00:46:35,942;kill Joffrey?
708;00:46:40,063;00:46:42,165;Tell me why.
709;00:46:46,420;00:46:50,006;I loved your mother more
709;00:46:46,420;00:46:50,006;than you could ever know.
710;00:46:52,643;00:46:55,344;Given the opportunity,
710;00:46:52,643;00:46:55,344;what do we do to those
711;00:46:55,380;00:46:57,413;who've hurt
711;00:46:55,380;00:46:57,413;the ones we love?
712;00:47:05,222;00:47:07,139;In a better world,
713;00:47:07,191;00:47:09,559;one where love
714;00:47:09,593;00:47:13,529;could overcome
714;00:47:09,593;00:47:13,529;strength and duty,
715;00:47:13,564;00:47:17,283;you might have been
715;00:47:13,564;00:47:17,283;my child.
716;00:47:20,287;00:47:22,822;But we don't live
716;00:47:20,287;00:47:22,822;in that world.
717;00:47:33,834;00:47:36,836;You're more beautiful
717;00:47:33,834;00:47:36,836;than she ever was.
718;00:47:38,672;00:47:40,256;Lord Baelish...
719;00:47:40,290;00:47:42,258;Call me Petyr.
720;00:48:09,169;00:48:11,654;You wanted
720;00:48:09,169;00:48:11,654;to see me, Aunt Lysa?
721;00:48:13,156;00:48:15,258;Come here, Sansa.
722;00:48:29,306;00:48:31,774;Do you know how far
722;00:48:29,306;00:48:31,774;the fall is?
723;00:48:33,644;00:48:34,777;No.
724;00:48:34,811;00:48:37,013;Neither do I, precisely.
725;00:48:37,047;00:48:39,582;Hundreds of feet.
726;00:48:39,616;00:48:41,734;It's fascinating
727;00:48:41,785;00:48:45,655;what happens to bodies when they
727;00:48:41,785;00:48:45,655;hit the rocks from such a height.
728;00:48:45,689;00:48:47,707;The impact breaks them
728;00:48:45,689;00:48:47,707;right apart.
729;00:48:47,741;00:48:51,160;Like eggs dropped
729;00:48:47,741;00:48:51,160;on the floor.
730;00:48:51,211;00:48:53,629;Sometimes pieces
730;00:48:51,211;00:48:53,629;remain intact.
731;00:48:53,665;00:48:56,332;You'll find the head
731;00:48:53,665;00:48:56,332;sitting on its own.
732;00:48:56,366;00:48:58,467;Every hair in place.
733;00:48:58,502;00:49:01,387;Blue eyes staring
733;00:48:58,502;00:49:01,387;at nothing.
734;00:49:10,213;00:49:12,932;I know what you did.
735;00:49:15,152;00:49:16,936;I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa.
736;00:49:16,987;00:49:19,822;I never should have hit Robin, I know it.
736;00:49:16,987;00:49:19,822;I promise it won't happen--
737;00:49:19,856;00:49:21,574;Don't be coy with me,
737;00:49:19,856;00:49:21,574;you little whore.
738;00:49:21,608;00:49:24,059;You kissed him.
738;00:49:21,608;00:49:24,059;You kissed Petyr.
739;00:49:24,077;00:49:26,278;I didn't. You don't understand.
739;00:49:24,077;00:49:26,278;I saw you.
740;00:49:26,330;00:49:29,615;You can't lie to me because
740;00:49:26,330;00:49:29,615;I saw it with my own eyes.
741;00:49:29,666;00:49:31,500;He kissed me. I pulled away.
741;00:49:29,666;00:49:31,500;Liar!
742;00:49:31,535;00:49:34,420;Whore! He is mine!
743;00:49:34,454;00:49:36,956;My father, my husband,
743;00:49:34,454;00:49:36,956;my sister,
744;00:49:37,007;00:49:39,175;they all stood between us
744;00:49:37,007;00:49:39,175;and now they're all dead.
745;00:49:39,209;00:49:43,262;That's what happens to people
745;00:49:39,209;00:49:43,262;who stand between Petyr and me.
746;00:49:43,296;00:49:44,964;Look down!
747;00:49:45,015;00:49:47,416;Look down!
747;00:49:45,015;00:49:47,416;Look down! Look down!
748;00:49:47,434;00:49:50,302;Lysa!
749;00:49:50,354;00:49:52,972;Let her go.
750;00:49:55,892;00:49:58,027;You want her?
751;00:49:58,061;00:50:01,697;This empty-headed child?
752;00:50:01,732;00:50:03,232;Let her go.
753;00:50:03,266;00:50:06,068;She's just like her mother.
753;00:50:03,266;00:50:06,068;She'll never love you.
754;00:50:06,102;00:50:08,637;I lied for you.
755;00:50:08,672;00:50:10,673;I killed for you.
756;00:50:10,707;00:50:13,042;Why did you bring
756;00:50:10,707;00:50:13,042;her here? Why?
757;00:50:13,076;00:50:14,994;I'll send her away.
758;00:50:16,296;00:50:18,881;I swear on my life.
759;00:50:19,833;00:50:22,385;I swear to all the gods.
760;00:50:23,754;00:50:25,287;Let her go, Lysa.
761;00:50:43,106;00:50:45,691;Oh, my sweet wife.
762;00:50:47,977;00:50:51,447;My sweet, silly wife.
763;00:50:58,872;00:51:01,257;I have only loved
763;00:50:58,872;00:51:01,257;one woman...
764;00:51:02,175;00:51:04,009;only one,
765;00:51:04,044;00:51:06,462;my entire life.
766;00:51:11,718;00:51:13,219;Your sister.
