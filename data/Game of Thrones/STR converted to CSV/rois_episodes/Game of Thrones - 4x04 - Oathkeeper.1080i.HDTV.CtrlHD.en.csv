1;00:03:38,534;00:03:40,836;My name
2;00:03:40,871;00:03:43,505;is Grey Worm.
3;00:03:45,174;00:03:47,175;I come from
4;00:03:47,210;00:03:50,262;the Summer Ills.
5;00:03:50,296;00:03:52,047;Isles.
6;00:03:52,098;00:03:55,183;Summer Isles.
7;00:03:55,218;00:03:58,437;Summer Isles.
8;00:04:05,695;00:04:08,730;I am from an island
8;00:04:05,695;00:04:08,730;called Naath.
9;00:04:10,650;00:04:13,318;When they took you?
10;00:04:13,352;00:04:16,538;When did they take me?
11;00:04:19,525;00:04:21,827;I was five years old.
12;00:04:21,861;00:04:23,996;You remember your home?
13;00:04:25,331;00:04:28,300;I remember when they
13;00:04:25,331;00:04:28,300;rowed us away from shore.
14;00:04:29,752;00:04:33,839;How white
14;00:04:29,752;00:04:33,839;the beaches were.
15;00:04:35,141;00:04:37,509;How tall the trees.
16;00:04:39,729;00:04:43,682;And I remember
16;00:04:39,729;00:04:43,682;my village burning.
17;00:04:43,733;00:04:47,235;Smoke rising
17;00:04:43,733;00:04:47,235;into the sky.
18;00:04:55,028;00:04:56,862;Do you remember your home?
19;00:04:58,498;00:05:00,115;Unsullied.
20;00:05:00,166;00:05:02,701;Always Unsullied.
21;00:05:02,735;00:05:06,038;Before Unsullied,
21;00:05:02,735;00:05:06,038;nothing.
22;00:05:06,089;00:05:08,340;That's not true.
23;00:05:10,293;00:05:13,045;Perhaps one day you will
23;00:05:10,293;00:05:13,045;return to the Summer Isles.
24;00:05:13,079;00:05:14,880;I don't want return.
25;00:05:20,186;00:05:21,753;Kill the masters.
26;00:05:21,771;00:05:24,356;Kill the masters.
27;00:05:26,258;00:05:27,893;How are the lessons coming?
28;00:05:27,927;00:05:30,862;Very well,
28;00:05:27,927;00:05:30,862;Your Grace.
29;00:05:30,897;00:05:34,282;Missandei is teacher
29;00:05:30,897;00:05:34,282;good, my queen.
30;00:05:37,203;00:05:39,121;You'll have
30;00:05:37,203;00:05:39,121;to continue later.
31;00:05:41,040;00:05:43,075;It's time.
32;00:09:31,721;00:09:35,440;Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
33;00:09:35,474;00:09:39,344;Mhysa! Mhysa!
33;00:09:35,474;00:09:39,344;Mhysa! Mhysa!
34;00:10:13,813;00:10:16,848;Mhysa! Mhysa!
35;00:10:21,821;00:10:23,571;Remind me, Ser Jorah,
36;00:10:23,606;00:10:27,108;how many children did the Great
36;00:10:23,606;00:10:27,108;Masters nail to mileposts?
37;00:10:27,159;00:10:30,445;163, Khaleesi.
38;00:10:30,496;00:10:32,497;Yes, that was it.
39;00:10:40,923;00:10:43,792;Your Grace,
39;00:10:40,923;00:10:43,792;may I have a word?
40;00:10:49,215;00:10:50,682;The city is yours.
41;00:10:50,716;00:10:53,518;All these people,
41;00:10:50,716;00:10:53,518;they're your subjects now.
42;00:10:54,753;00:10:57,255;Sometimes it is better
42;00:10:54,753;00:10:57,255;to answer injustice
43;00:10:57,273;00:10:59,090;with mercy.
44;00:10:59,108;00:11:03,228;I will answer injustice
44;00:10:59,108;00:11:03,228;with justice.
45;00:12:21,941;00:12:23,725;What the hell was that?
46;00:12:23,776;00:12:27,228;That was me knocking
46;00:12:23,776;00:12:27,228;your ass to the dirt
47;00:12:27,279;00:12:28,980;with your own hand.
48;00:12:31,901;00:12:33,067;You're a rare talent.
49;00:12:33,119;00:12:36,321;When you're fighting
49;00:12:33,119;00:12:36,321;cripples, anyway.
50;00:12:37,790;00:12:39,874;You learned to fight
50;00:12:37,790;00:12:39,874;like a good little boy.
51;00:12:39,909;00:12:42,961;I'll bet that thrust through the Mad
51;00:12:39,909;00:12:42,961;King's back was pretty as a picture.
52;00:12:42,995;00:12:45,363;You want to fight pretty
52;00:12:42,995;00:12:45,363;or you want to win?
53;00:12:45,381;00:12:47,165;You talk to my brother
53;00:12:45,381;00:12:47,165;this way?
54;00:12:47,217;00:12:48,750;All the time.
55;00:12:48,801;00:12:51,136;He got used to it.
56;00:12:58,561;00:13:01,045;Do you think
56;00:12:58,561;00:13:01,045;he did it?
57;00:13:01,063;00:13:03,148;No.
58;00:13:03,182;00:13:05,683;Oh, he hated
58;00:13:03,182;00:13:05,683;the little twat, sure.
59;00:13:05,717;00:13:07,685;But who didn't?
60;00:13:08,687;00:13:10,738;And poison's
60;00:13:08,687;00:13:10,738;not his style.
61;00:13:11,723;00:13:14,192;Or murder,
61;00:13:11,723;00:13:14,192;for that matter.
62;00:13:15,561;00:13:17,912;You want to know for sure,
62;00:13:15,561;00:13:17,912;why don't you ask him?
63;00:13:22,535;00:13:24,419;You haven't been
63;00:13:22,535;00:13:24,419;to see him yet, eh?
64;00:13:25,538;00:13:27,372;We're done for today.
65;00:13:30,576;00:13:32,577;Your brother ever tell you
65;00:13:30,576;00:13:32,577;how I came into his service?
66;00:13:32,595;00:13:35,763;You stood for him in his trial
66;00:13:32,595;00:13:35,763;by combat at the Eyrie.
67;00:13:35,798;00:13:37,932;Aye.
68;00:13:37,967;00:13:39,968;But only when
68;00:13:37,967;00:13:39,968;Lady Arryn demanded
69;00:13:40,019;00:13:42,637;the trial take place
69;00:13:40,019;00:13:42,637;that day.
70;00:13:42,688;00:13:44,806;You were his first choice.
71;00:13:44,857;00:13:47,258;He named you
71;00:13:44,857;00:13:47,258;for his champion
72;00:13:47,276;00:13:50,895;because he knew you would ride day
72;00:13:47,276;00:13:50,895;and night to come fight for him.
73;00:13:52,481;00:13:54,365;You gonna fight
73;00:13:52,481;00:13:54,365;for him now?
74;00:14:02,458;00:14:05,076;To tell you the truth,
74;00:14:02,458;00:14:05,076;this isn't so bad.
75;00:14:05,110;00:14:08,162;Four walls.
75;00:14:05,110;00:14:08,162;A pot to piss in.
76;00:14:08,214;00:14:10,965;I was chained
76;00:14:08,214;00:14:10,965;to a wooden post
77;00:14:11,000;00:14:13,585;covered in my own
77;00:14:11,000;00:14:13,585;shit for months.
78;00:14:16,555;00:14:19,173;Is that supposed
78;00:14:16,555;00:14:19,173;to make me feel better?
79;00:14:19,225;00:14:20,925;Maybe a bit.
80;00:14:23,812;00:14:25,680;I'm sorry I didn't
80;00:14:23,812;00:14:25,680;come sooner.
81;00:14:25,731;00:14:28,566;It's complicated, yes.
82;00:14:29,785;00:14:32,570;So how is our sister?
82;00:14:29,785;00:14:32,570;How do you think?
83;00:14:32,605;00:14:35,189;Her son died in her arms.
84;00:14:35,241;00:14:37,808;Her son?
85;00:14:37,826;00:14:40,194;Don't.
86;00:14:44,783;00:14:46,985;You know what's coming?
87;00:14:47,019;00:14:49,821;My trial for regicide.
87;00:14:47,019;00:14:49,821;Yes, I know.
88;00:14:51,190;00:14:54,893;I know the whole bloody
88;00:14:51,190;00:14:54,893;country thinks I'm guilty.
89;00:14:54,927;00:14:57,095;I know that one
89;00:14:54,927;00:14:57,095;of my three judges
90;00:14:57,129;00:14:59,347;has wished me dead more
90;00:14:57,129;00:14:59,347;times than I can count.
91;00:14:59,382;00:15:01,883;And that judge
91;00:14:59,382;00:15:01,883;is my father.
92;00:15:03,052;00:15:04,502;As for Cersei,
93;00:15:04,520;00:15:06,504;well, she's probably
93;00:15:04,520;00:15:06,504;working on a way
94;00:15:06,555;00:15:09,357;to avoid a trial altogether
94;00:15:06,555;00:15:09,357;by having me killed.
95;00:15:09,391;00:15:12,827;Now that you mention it,
95;00:15:09,391;00:15:12,827;she did ask.
96;00:15:12,861;00:15:15,730;So, should I turn around
96;00:15:12,861;00:15:15,730;and close my eyes?
97;00:15:15,814;00:15:17,916;Depends.
98;00:15:17,950;00:15:20,134;Did you do it?
99;00:15:20,169;00:15:21,920;The Kingslayer brothers.
100;00:15:21,954;00:15:25,323;You like it?
100;00:15:21,954;00:15:25,323;I like it.
101;00:15:27,076;00:15:29,827;You're really asking
101;00:15:27,076;00:15:29,827;if I killed your son?
102;00:15:29,861;00:15:33,381;Are you really asking
102;00:15:29,861;00:15:33,381;if I'd kill my brother?
103;00:15:37,102;00:15:38,820;How can I help you?
104;00:15:39,922;00:15:41,389;Well, you could
104;00:15:39,922;00:15:41,389;set me free.
105;00:15:42,641;00:15:44,559;You know I can't.
106;00:15:44,593;00:15:47,645;Then there's really
106;00:15:44,593;00:15:47,645;nothing else to say.
107;00:15:47,680;00:15:50,014;What do you want me to do?
107;00:15:47,680;00:15:50,014;Kill the guards?
108;00:15:50,099;00:15:51,516;Sneak you out of the city
108;00:15:50,099;00:15:51,516;in the back of a cart?
109;00:15:51,567;00:15:53,518;I'm the Lord Commander
109;00:15:51,567;00:15:53,518;of the Kingsguard.
110;00:15:53,552;00:15:55,320;Sorry, I'd forgotten.
111;00:15:55,354;00:15:57,438;I'd hate for you to do
111;00:15:55,354;00:15:57,438;something inappropriate.
112;00:15:57,489;00:15:58,940;Inappropriate?
113;00:15:58,991;00:16:01,943;You're accused of killing the king.
113;00:15:58,991;00:16:01,943;Freeing you is treason.
114;00:16:01,994;00:16:03,894;Except I didn't do it.
115;00:16:03,912;00:16:05,913;Which is why
115;00:16:03,912;00:16:05,913;we're having a trial.
116;00:16:05,948;00:16:08,249;A trial.
117;00:16:08,283;00:16:11,035;If the killer threw himself
117;00:16:08,283;00:16:11,035;before the Iron Throne,
118;00:16:11,069;00:16:15,373;confessed to his crimes, and gave
118;00:16:11,069;00:16:15,373;irrefutable evidence of his guilt,
119;00:16:15,407;00:16:16,841;it wouldn't matter
119;00:16:15,407;00:16:16,841;to Cersei.
120;00:16:16,875;00:16:19,877;She won't rest
120;00:16:16,875;00:16:19,877;until my head's on a spike.
121;00:16:19,911;00:16:22,046;Not just yours.
122;00:16:22,080;00:16:25,433;She's offering a knighthood
122;00:16:22,080;00:16:25,433;to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
123;00:16:25,467;00:16:27,084;Sansa couldn't
123;00:16:25,467;00:16:27,084;have done this.
124;00:16:27,102;00:16:29,887;She had more reason than
124;00:16:27,102;00:16:29,887;anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.
125;00:16:29,921;00:16:32,423;Do you think it's a coincidence she
125;00:16:29,921;00:16:32,423;disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
126;00:16:32,441;00:16:34,726;No, but...
127;00:16:35,761;00:16:37,945;Sansa's not a killer.
128;00:16:40,232;00:16:41,616;Not yet, anyway.
129;00:16:55,080;00:16:57,131;Where are you taking me?
130;00:16:57,167;00:16:59,333;I'm getting married
130;00:16:57,167;00:16:59,333;to your Aunt Lysa.
131;00:16:59,385;00:17:01,619;She's waiting for us
131;00:16:59,385;00:17:01,619;at the Eyrie.
132;00:17:01,637;00:17:04,422;You'll be safe there.
133;00:17:16,518;00:17:18,236;Did you kill Joffrey?
134;00:17:18,270;00:17:21,439;Did I kill Joffrey?
135;00:17:22,808;00:17:24,742;I've been in
135;00:17:22,808;00:17:24,742;the Vale for weeks.
136;00:17:24,777;00:17:25,943;I know it was you.
137;00:17:25,977;00:17:29,914;And who helped me
137;00:17:25,977;00:17:29,914;with this conspiracy?
138;00:17:32,000;00:17:33,818;Well, there was Ser Dontos.
139;00:17:33,836;00:17:36,037;You used him to get
139;00:17:33,836;00:17:36,037;me out of King's Landing,
140;00:17:36,088;00:17:38,673;but you would never trust
140;00:17:36,088;00:17:38,673;him to kill the king.
141;00:17:38,791;00:17:42,343;Why not? - Because you're
141;00:17:38,791;00:17:42,343;too smart to trust a drunk.
142;00:17:42,377;00:17:44,929;Then perhaps it was
142;00:17:42,377;00:17:44,929;your husband.
143;00:17:44,963;00:17:46,497;No.
144;00:17:46,515;00:17:48,266;How do you know?
145;00:17:48,300;00:17:50,935;I just do.
146;00:17:50,969;00:17:53,104;You're right.
147;00:17:53,138;00:17:55,606;He wasn't involved
147;00:17:53,138;00:17:55,606;in Joffrey's death.
148;00:17:55,641;00:17:57,642;But you were.
149;00:17:59,111;00:18:02,396;Do you remember that lovely
149;00:17:59,111;00:18:02,396;necklace Dontos gave you?
150;00:18:02,448;00:18:06,617;I don't suppose you noticed
150;00:18:02,448;00:18:06,617;that a stone was missing
151;00:18:06,652;00:18:08,903;after the feast.
152;00:18:08,954;00:18:11,489;The poison.
153;00:18:13,325;00:18:15,526;I don't understand.
154;00:18:15,544;00:18:18,129;The Lannisters gave you
154;00:18:15,544;00:18:18,129;wealth, power.
155;00:18:18,163;00:18:19,964;Joffrey made you
155;00:18:18,163;00:18:19,964;the Lord of Harrenhal.
156;00:18:19,998;00:18:22,867;A man with no motive
156;00:18:19,998;00:18:22,867;is a man no one suspects.
157;00:18:22,885;00:18:25,553;Always keep
157;00:18:22,885;00:18:25,553;your foes confused.
158;00:18:25,587;00:18:28,506;If they don't know who
158;00:18:25,587;00:18:28,506;you are or what you want,
159;00:18:28,540;00:18:31,642;they can't know
159;00:18:28,540;00:18:31,642;what you plan to do next.
160;00:18:34,596;00:18:36,564;I don't believe you.
161;00:18:38,350;00:18:40,735;If they catch you, they'll
161;00:18:38,350;00:18:40,735;put your head on a spike
162;00:18:40,769;00:18:42,153;just like my father's.
163;00:18:42,187;00:18:45,356;You'd risk that
163;00:18:42,187;00:18:45,356;just to confuse them?
164;00:18:46,992;00:18:50,528;So many men,
164;00:18:46,992;00:18:50,528;they risk so little.
165;00:18:50,562;00:18:53,564;They spend their lives
165;00:18:50,562;00:18:53,564;avoiding danger.
166;00:18:53,582;00:18:56,000;And then they die.
167;00:18:57,286;00:19:01,088;I'd risk everything
167;00:18:57,286;00:19:01,088;to get what I want.
168;00:19:01,123;00:19:04,258;And what do you want?
169;00:19:10,215;00:19:11,799;Everything.
170;00:19:13,635;00:19:16,971;My friendship with the
170;00:19:13,635;00:19:16,971;Lannisters was productive.
171;00:19:17,022;00:19:19,724;But Joffrey,
172;00:19:19,758;00:19:22,276;a vicious boy with
172;00:19:19,758;00:19:22,276;a crown on his head,
173;00:19:22,311;00:19:24,595;is not a reliable ally.
174;00:19:24,613;00:19:26,564;And who could trust
174;00:19:24,613;00:19:26,564;a friend like that?
175;00:19:26,615;00:19:28,866;Who could trust you?
176;00:19:30,118;00:19:32,436;I don't want
176;00:19:30,118;00:19:32,436;friends like me.
177;00:19:32,454;00:19:34,939;My new friends
177;00:19:32,454;00:19:34,939;are predictable.
178;00:19:34,957;00:19:36,457;Very reasonable people.
179;00:19:36,491;00:19:39,210;As for what
179;00:19:36,491;00:19:39,210;happened to Joffrey,
180;00:19:39,244;00:19:43,548;well, that was something my new
180;00:19:39,244;00:19:43,548;friends wanted very badly.
181;00:19:43,582;00:19:46,050;Nothing like
181;00:19:43,582;00:19:46,050;a thoughtful gift
182;00:19:46,084;00:19:48,669;to make a new friendship
182;00:19:46,084;00:19:48,669;grow strong.
183;00:19:48,720;00:19:50,621;I can't believe
183;00:19:48,720;00:19:50,621;you're going.
184;00:19:50,639;00:19:53,257;Leaving me alone here
184;00:19:50,639;00:19:53,257;with these people.
185;00:19:53,291;00:19:55,626;The time has come,
185;00:19:53,291;00:19:55,626;my dear.
186;00:19:55,644;00:19:58,679;There's nothing
186;00:19:55,644;00:19:58,679;more tedious than a trial.
187;00:19:58,730;00:20:01,182;Except perhaps
187;00:19:58,730;00:20:01,182;these gardens.
188;00:20:01,233;00:20:03,968;If I have to take one
188;00:20:01,233;00:20:03,968;more leisurely stroll
189;00:20:03,986;00:20:07,188;through these gardens, I'll
189;00:20:03,986;00:20:07,188;fling myself from the cliffs.
190;00:20:08,774;00:20:10,741;Have you been
190;00:20:08,774;00:20:10,741;to see Tommen yet?
191;00:20:10,776;00:20:12,743;No.
192;00:20:12,778;00:20:14,695;Have they even agreed
192;00:20:12,778;00:20:14,695;to the match?
193;00:20:14,746;00:20:16,480;No one tells me anything.
194;00:20:16,498;00:20:20,701;I wasn't originally meant to marry
194;00:20:16,498;00:20:20,701;your grandfather Luthor, you know.
195;00:20:20,752;00:20:23,120;He was engaged
195;00:20:20,752;00:20:23,120;to my sister,
196;00:20:23,154;00:20:25,322;your great-aunt Viola.
197;00:20:25,340;00:20:28,593;I was to be given to
197;00:20:25,340;00:20:28,593;some Targaryen or other.
198;00:20:28,627;00:20:32,346;Marrying a Targaryen
198;00:20:28,627;00:20:32,346;was all the rage back then.
199;00:20:32,381;00:20:34,932;But the moment
199;00:20:32,381;00:20:34,932;I saw my intended,
200;00:20:34,967;00:20:38,302;with his twitchy
200;00:20:34,967;00:20:38,302;little ferret's face
201;00:20:38,353;00:20:40,304;and ludicrous silver hair,
202;00:20:40,338;00:20:42,356;I knew he wouldn't do.
203;00:20:42,391;00:20:44,942;So the evening
204;00:20:44,977;00:20:48,029;before Luthor was
204;00:20:44,977;00:20:48,029;to propose to my sister,
205;00:20:48,063;00:20:50,731;I got lost on my way back
205;00:20:48,063;00:20:50,731;from my embroidery lesson
206;00:20:50,782;00:20:53,067;and happened
206;00:20:50,782;00:20:53,067;upon his chamber.
207;00:20:54,352;00:20:56,687;How absentminded of me.
207;00:20:54,352;00:20:56,687;Mm-hmm.
208;00:20:56,705;00:21:00,875;The following morning, Luthor
208;00:20:56,705;00:21:00,875;never made it down the stairs
209;00:21:00,909;00:21:04,662;to propose to my sister 'cause
209;00:21:00,909;00:21:04,662;the boy couldn't bloody walk.
210;00:21:04,696;00:21:06,998;And once he could,
210;00:21:04,696;00:21:06,998;the only thing he wanted
211;00:21:07,032;00:21:09,417;was what I'd given him
211;00:21:07,032;00:21:09,417;the night before.
212;00:21:09,468;00:21:11,636;I was good.
213;00:21:11,670;00:21:14,338;I was very, very good.
214;00:21:16,174;00:21:18,809;You are even better.
215;00:21:18,844;00:21:20,428;But you need
215;00:21:18,844;00:21:20,428;to act quickly.
216;00:21:20,479;00:21:24,315;Cersei may be vicious,
216;00:21:20,479;00:21:24,315;but she's not stupid.
217;00:21:24,349;00:21:27,234;She'll turn the boy against
217;00:21:24,349;00:21:27,234;you as soon as she can.
218;00:21:27,269;00:21:30,571;And by the time you're
218;00:21:27,269;00:21:30,571;married, it'll be too late.
219;00:21:30,605;00:21:32,573;Luckily for you,
219;00:21:30,605;00:21:32,573;the Queen Regent
220;00:21:32,607;00:21:34,442;is rather distracted
220;00:21:32,607;00:21:34,442;at the moment.
221;00:21:34,493;00:21:36,911;Mourning her dear
221;00:21:34,493;00:21:36,911;departed boy.
222;00:21:36,945;00:21:39,330;Accusing her brother
222;00:21:36,945;00:21:39,330;of his murder,
223;00:21:39,364;00:21:41,332;which he didn't commit.
224;00:21:41,366;00:21:42,500;Well, he could have done.
225;00:21:42,534;00:21:44,452;He could have done,
225;00:21:42,534;00:21:44,452;but he didn't.
226;00:21:44,503;00:21:47,505;You don't know, Grandmother.
226;00:21:44,503;00:21:47,505;But I do know.
227;00:21:47,539;00:21:52,126;You don't think I'd let you
227;00:21:47,539;00:21:52,126;marry that beast, do you?
228;00:21:53,211;00:21:56,246;What?
228;00:21:53,211;00:21:56,246;I don't understand.
229;00:21:56,264;00:21:59,884;Shh. Don't you worry
229;00:21:56,264;00:21:59,884;yourself about all that.
230;00:22:02,187;00:22:04,555;You just do
230;00:22:02,187;00:22:04,555;what needs to be done.
231;00:22:06,024;00:22:08,025;Bring it through!
232;00:22:15,367;00:22:17,651;And again.
233;00:22:23,125;00:22:26,911;Very nice. Good.
234;00:22:26,945;00:22:29,613;A lot of wildlings fight
234;00:22:26,945;00:22:29,613;with a weapon in each hand.
235;00:22:29,632;00:22:32,633;First thing you want to do
236;00:22:32,718;00:22:35,419;is disarm them to try
236;00:22:32,718;00:22:35,419;and even the odds.
237;00:22:49,151;00:22:50,901;Let's see what you can do.
238;00:22:52,804;00:22:54,605;Olly, you just watch
238;00:22:52,804;00:22:54,605;for now.
239;00:22:54,639;00:22:55,689;I can fight.
240;00:22:55,741;00:22:57,808;Have you ever
240;00:22:55,741;00:22:57,808;held a sword before?
241;00:22:57,826;00:22:59,860;I was the best archer
241;00:22:57,826;00:22:59,860;in our hamlet.
242;00:22:59,911;00:23:02,279;I was!
243;00:23:02,331;00:23:04,615;I believe you.
244;00:23:04,666;00:23:06,333;We'll go hunting
244;00:23:04,666;00:23:06,333;for rabbits one day.
245;00:23:06,418;00:23:08,085;Right now,
245;00:23:06,418;00:23:08,085;watch and learn.
246;00:23:10,372;00:23:12,339;You two.
247;00:23:12,374;00:23:15,459;Take it slow,
247;00:23:12,374;00:23:15,459;try and disarm each other.
248;00:23:41,319;00:23:43,037;You know how to fight.
249;00:23:43,071;00:23:45,539;You could have gone
249;00:23:43,071;00:23:45,539;easier on him.
250;00:23:45,575;00:23:47,992;He wouldn't have learned
250;00:23:45,575;00:23:47,992;anything that way.
251;00:23:48,193;00:23:50,995;Lord Snow.
252;00:23:51,046;00:23:53,530;What do you think
252;00:23:51,046;00:23:53,530;you're doing?
253;00:23:53,548;00:23:56,167;Grenn and I were
253;00:23:53,548;00:23:56,167;helping them.
254;00:23:56,218;00:23:58,335;Grenn's a ranger.
254;00:23:56,218;00:23:58,335;You're a steward.
255;00:23:58,369;00:24:01,472;Maybe you forgot that while you
255;00:23:58,369;00:24:01,472;were off with your wildling bitch,
256;00:24:01,506;00:24:03,474;but I didn't.
257;00:24:03,508;00:24:05,843;Someone has
257;00:24:03,508;00:24:05,843;to train them.
258;00:24:05,877;00:24:07,728;And that someone
258;00:24:05,877;00:24:07,728;isn't you.
259;00:24:07,762;00:24:10,097;Go find a chamber pot
259;00:24:07,762;00:24:10,097;to empty.
260;00:24:12,684;00:24:15,402;Go on. Do it.
261;00:24:15,437;00:24:17,438;You traitor's bastard.
262;00:24:17,489;00:24:19,406;Give me an excuse.
263;00:24:19,441;00:24:22,359;Mormont's not here
263;00:24:19,441;00:24:22,359;to protect you now.
264;00:24:33,338;00:24:35,756;Get back to work.
265;00:24:35,791;00:24:38,209;Now!
266;00:24:38,243;00:24:40,761;I said now!
267;00:24:43,915;00:24:47,017;The bastard's well-liked.
267;00:24:43,915;00:24:47,017;You're not.
268;00:24:47,052;00:24:49,603;You think I care if they like me?
268;00:24:47,052;00:24:49,603;We're at war.
269;00:24:49,638;00:24:51,188;For now.
270;00:24:51,223;00:24:53,423;But you can't be
270;00:24:51,223;00:24:53,423;acting commander forever.
271;00:24:53,441;00:24:55,559;There will be a choosing.
272;00:24:55,611;00:24:57,561;The old maester
272;00:24:55,611;00:24:57,561;will insist on it.
273;00:24:57,595;00:25:00,064;You might reconsider
274;00:25:00,098;00:25:02,816;his request to march
274;00:25:00,098;00:25:02,816;on Craster's.
275;00:25:02,868;00:25:06,453;Let the mutineers
275;00:25:02,868;00:25:06,453;take care of Snow.
276;00:25:06,488;00:25:08,906;Or you might be taking
276;00:25:06,488;00:25:08,906;orders from him
277;00:25:08,940;00:25:10,491;the rest of your life.
278;00:25:26,057;00:25:27,508;A bastard, eh?
279;00:25:27,559;00:25:30,261;Took you for highborn.
280;00:25:31,680;00:25:33,647;My father was highborn.
281;00:25:33,682;00:25:36,350;My mother wasn't.
282;00:25:38,520;00:25:40,437;Name's Locke.
283;00:25:42,991;00:25:44,275;Jon Snow.
284;00:25:47,746;00:25:49,163;You fight well.
285;00:25:49,197;00:25:50,915;What brought you up here?
286;00:25:50,949;00:25:53,033;A sense of duty.
287;00:25:53,084;00:25:56,337;I wanted to do my part
287;00:25:53,084;00:25:56,337;for the safety of the realm.
288;00:25:59,041;00:26:01,625;I was a game warden
288;00:25:59,041;00:26:01,625;in the Stormlands.
289;00:26:01,659;00:26:04,261;Fed a prized partridge
289;00:26:01,659;00:26:04,261;to my hungry kids.
290;00:26:04,296;00:26:06,096;I was stupid enough
290;00:26:04,296;00:26:06,096;to get caught.
291;00:26:06,131;00:26:08,265;Chose the Wall
291;00:26:06,131;00:26:08,265;over losing my hand.
292;00:26:08,300;00:26:11,969;Figured I wouldn't have to suck
292;00:26:08,300;00:26:11,969;up to any highborn cunts here.
293;00:26:12,020;00:26:14,271;Come on, get on with it.
294;00:26:14,306;00:26:16,023;What are you
294;00:26:14,306;00:26:16,023;waiting for? Summer?
295;00:26:16,057;00:26:17,524;Guess I was wrong.
296;00:26:37,712;00:26:39,830;You sent for me,
296;00:26:37,712;00:26:39,830;Your Grace?
297;00:26:39,864;00:26:41,799;Your Grace.
298;00:26:41,833;00:26:43,634;How formal of you.
299;00:26:45,536;00:26:48,756;How many Kingsguards are
299;00:26:45,536;00:26:48,756;posted outside Tommen's door?
300;00:26:48,807;00:26:52,209;Ser Boros
300;00:26:48,807;00:26:52,209;is on duty tonight.
301;00:26:52,228;00:26:54,595;Tomorrow I believe--
301;00:26:52,228;00:26:54,595;So one?
302;00:26:55,880;00:26:58,766;You have one man
302;00:26:55,880;00:26:58,766;guarding the future king?
303;00:26:58,817;00:27:00,851;I promise you
303;00:26:58,817;00:27:00,851;Tommen's safe.
304;00:27:00,902;00:27:02,152;We're protecting him.
305;00:27:02,187;00:27:05,322;The way you
305;00:27:02,187;00:27:05,322;protected Joffrey?
306;00:27:06,658;00:27:09,193;Why did Catelyn Stark
306;00:27:06,658;00:27:09,193;set you free?
307;00:27:09,244;00:27:11,895;What? - I've been
307;00:27:09,244;00:27:11,895;wondering for months.
308;00:27:11,913;00:27:15,699;Ever since that great cow brought
308;00:27:11,913;00:27:15,699;you back to the capital.
309;00:27:16,668;00:27:18,369;Why did she
309;00:27:16,668;00:27:18,369;set you free?
310;00:27:18,403;00:27:21,372;You know why. She'd hoped I'd
310;00:27:18,403;00:27:21,372;send her daughters back to her.
311;00:27:26,428;00:27:28,379;She hoped
311;00:27:26,428;00:27:28,379;or did you promise?
312;00:27:28,413;00:27:30,214;I swore by all the gods
313;00:27:30,265;00:27:32,716;that if her daughters were
313;00:27:30,265;00:27:32,716;alive, I'd return them to her.
314;00:27:32,801;00:27:34,685;So you made a sacred vow
314;00:27:32,801;00:27:34,685;to the enemy.
315;00:27:34,719;00:27:37,388;I wanted to get
315;00:27:34,719;00:27:37,388;back to you.
316;00:27:38,523;00:27:40,224;Should I have told her
316;00:27:38,523;00:27:40,224;to fuck off?
317;00:27:40,258;00:27:42,142;You didn't mean it, then?
318;00:27:42,193;00:27:45,195;You have no loyalty
318;00:27:42,193;00:27:45,195;to Catelyn Stark?
319;00:27:45,230;00:27:47,064;Catelyn Stark's dead.
320;00:27:47,115;00:27:49,400;So if I told you to leave the
320;00:27:47,115;00:27:49,400;capital right now and find Sansa,
321;00:27:49,434;00:27:53,570;if I told you to find that
321;00:27:49,434;00:27:53,570;murderous little bitch
322;00:27:53,621;00:27:55,622;and bring me her head,
323;00:27:55,657;00:27:57,891;would you do it?
324;00:28:02,414;00:28:04,682;I know you went
324;00:28:02,414;00:28:04,682;to see Tyrion.
325;00:28:07,052;00:28:10,854;That creature
325;00:28:07,052;00:28:10,854;who murdered our son.
326;00:28:13,091;00:28:15,325;I had to see him.
327;00:28:15,360;00:28:16,844;I had to know
327;00:28:15,360;00:28:16,844;for myself.
328;00:28:16,895;00:28:18,896;And?
329;00:28:20,482;00:28:23,100;He didn't do it, Cersei.
330;00:28:23,134;00:28:25,602;You've always pitied him.
331;00:28:25,636;00:28:28,939;Our poor little brother.
332;00:28:28,991;00:28:30,774;Abused by the world.
333;00:28:30,808;00:28:32,776;Despised by his father
333;00:28:30,808;00:28:32,776;and sister.
334;00:28:32,810;00:28:35,662;He'd kill us all
334;00:28:32,810;00:28:35,662;if he could.
335;00:28:38,500;00:28:41,835;I want four men at Tommen's
335;00:28:38,500;00:28:41,835;door day and night.
336;00:28:43,505;00:28:46,090;That will be all,
336;00:28:43,505;00:28:46,090;Lord Commander.
337;00:29:20,691;00:29:22,743;Ser Pounce?
338;00:29:36,707;00:29:38,892;How did you get past
338;00:29:36,707;00:29:38,892;the Kingsguard?
339;00:29:38,927;00:29:41,562;Kingsguard.
340;00:29:42,931;00:29:46,150;I don't think you're
340;00:29:42,931;00:29:46,150;supposed to be here.
341;00:29:46,184;00:29:49,186;Mother doesn't allow me
341;00:29:46,184;00:29:49,186;to have visitors at night.
342;00:29:49,220;00:29:51,738;I'm not a visitor,
342;00:29:49,220;00:29:51,738;Your Grace.
343;00:29:51,773;00:29:55,008;Word has it
343;00:29:51,773;00:29:55,008;I'm to be your bride.
344;00:30:00,114;00:30:02,499;Did you know that people
344;00:30:00,114;00:30:02,499;in arranged marriages
345;00:30:02,534;00:30:05,536;often never meet
345;00:30:02,534;00:30:05,536;until their wedding day?
346;00:30:08,289;00:30:11,925;Before we decide to spend
346;00:30:08,289;00:30:11,925;our lives together,
347;00:30:11,960;00:30:14,178;we ought to get
347;00:30:11,960;00:30:14,178;to know one another.
348;00:30:14,212;00:30:16,380;Don't you think?
349;00:30:17,866;00:30:19,749;Yes.
350;00:30:19,767;00:30:21,802;But if my mother
350;00:30:19,767;00:30:21,802;found out--
351;00:30:21,853;00:30:24,488;It can be our secret.
351;00:30:21,853;00:30:24,488;Hmm?
352;00:30:26,441;00:30:28,892;If we're going to be
352;00:30:26,441;00:30:28,892;man and wife,
353;00:30:28,926;00:30:32,830;we'll have a few secrets
353;00:30:28,926;00:30:32,830;from her, I hope.
354;00:30:34,365;00:30:36,817;So, Your Grace...
355;00:30:36,851;00:30:39,203;Yes?
356;00:30:39,237;00:30:42,039;Tell me a secret.
357;00:30:49,297;00:30:51,782;Hello. Aren't you
357;00:30:49,297;00:30:51,782;a proper fellow?
358;00:30:51,816;00:30:54,167;That's Ser Pounce.
359;00:30:54,219;00:30:56,570;Very handsome.
360;00:30:58,640;00:31:00,090;Joffrey didn't like him.
361;00:31:00,124;00:31:02,593;He threatened
361;00:31:00,124;00:31:02,593;to skin him alive
362;00:31:02,627;00:31:04,428;and mix his innards
362;00:31:02,627;00:31:04,428;up in my food
363;00:31:04,479;00:31:06,263;so I wouldn't know
363;00:31:04,479;00:31:06,263;I was eating him.
364;00:31:06,314;00:31:09,016;That's very cruel.
365;00:31:09,050;00:31:12,002;You don't strike me
365;00:31:09,050;00:31:12,002;as cruel.
366;00:31:13,471;00:31:15,172;No.
367;00:31:15,206;00:31:17,074;I don't think I am.
368;00:31:17,108;00:31:19,142;That's a relief.
369;00:31:19,177;00:31:21,511;Because you know
369;00:31:19,177;00:31:21,511;what happens when we marry?
370;00:31:21,579;00:31:23,780;We say our vows in front
370;00:31:21,579;00:31:23,780;of the high septon.
371;00:31:23,814;00:31:25,616;And after the ceremony,
371;00:31:23,814;00:31:25,616;there's a feast.
372;00:31:25,650;00:31:28,085;When we marry,
372;00:31:25,650;00:31:28,085;I become yours.
373;00:31:28,119;00:31:29,670;Forever.
374;00:31:32,457;00:31:34,174;It's getting late.
375;00:31:35,993;00:31:37,628;I should go.
376;00:31:38,663;00:31:40,264;May I come and visit
376;00:31:38,663;00:31:40,264;you again?
377;00:31:42,383;00:31:45,235;All right, then.
378;00:31:50,007;00:31:51,775;Remember,
379;00:31:51,809;00:31:55,445;our little secret.
380;00:32:32,383;00:32:34,017;Ser Jaime Lannister.
381;00:32:34,051;00:32:37,821;Knighted and named to the
381;00:32:34,051;00:32:37,821;Kingsguard in his 16th year.
382;00:32:37,855;00:32:40,357;At the sack
382;00:32:37,855;00:32:40,357;of King's Landing,
383;00:32:40,391;00:32:42,776;murdered his king
383;00:32:40,391;00:32:42,776;Aerys II.
384;00:32:42,827;00:32:46,029;Pardoned by
384;00:32:42,827;00:32:46,029;Robert Baratheon.
385;00:32:47,332;00:32:49,282;Thereafter known
385;00:32:47,332;00:32:49,282;as the Kingslayer.
386;00:32:49,334;00:32:52,619;It's the duty of the Lord
386;00:32:49,334;00:32:52,619;Commander to fill those pages.
387;00:32:55,790;00:32:58,592;And there's still room
387;00:32:55,790;00:32:58,592;left on mine.
388;00:33:28,790;00:33:31,241;Valyrian steel.
389;00:33:31,292;00:33:33,777;Mmm.
390;00:33:33,795;00:33:35,111;It's yours.
391;00:33:35,129;00:33:36,780;I can't accept this.
392;00:33:36,798;00:33:39,115;It was reforged
392;00:33:36,798;00:33:39,115;from Ned Stark's sword.
393;00:33:39,133;00:33:42,252;You'll use it to defend
393;00:33:39,133;00:33:42,252;Ned Stark's daughter.
394;00:33:43,838;00:33:47,808;You swore an oath to return the
394;00:33:43,838;00:33:47,808;Stark girls to their mother.
395;00:33:47,842;00:33:50,227;Lady Stark's dead.
396;00:33:50,261;00:33:52,179;Arya's probably
396;00:33:50,261;00:33:52,179;dead, too,
397;00:33:52,230;00:33:55,399;but there's still a chance to find
397;00:33:52,230;00:33:55,399;Sansa and get her somewhere safe.
398;00:33:56,684;00:33:58,351;I've got something
398;00:33:56,684;00:33:58,351;else for you.
399;00:34:17,004;00:34:19,506;I hope I got
399;00:34:17,004;00:34:19,506;your measurements right.
400;00:34:22,159;00:34:23,794;I'll find her.
401;00:34:25,496;00:34:28,632;For Lady Catelyn.
402;00:34:31,636;00:34:33,303;And for you.
403;00:34:40,228;00:34:42,362;I almost forgot.
404;00:34:43,314;00:34:45,482;I have one more gift.
405;00:34:49,353;00:34:51,204;I don't need a squire.
406;00:34:51,239;00:34:53,156;Of course you do.
407;00:34:53,190;00:34:54,791;He'll slow me down.
408;00:34:54,826;00:34:57,160;My brother owes him a debt.
408;00:34:54,826;00:34:57,160;He's not safe here.
409;00:34:57,194;00:34:59,713;You're keeping him from harm.
409;00:34:57,194;00:34:59,713;It's chivalry.
410;00:34:59,747;00:35:02,799;I won't
410;00:34:59,747;00:35:02,799;slow you down, ser--
411;00:35:04,302;00:35:06,253;my lady.
412;00:35:06,304;00:35:08,755;I promise
412;00:35:06,304;00:35:08,755;I'll serve you well.
413;00:35:08,806;00:35:12,092;See? He's a good lad.
413;00:35:08,806;00:35:12,092;You'll get along.
414;00:35:16,213;00:35:18,598;Compliments of Lord Tyrion.
415;00:35:18,649;00:35:21,651;His axe from the Blackwater.
416;00:35:26,741;00:35:28,825;What are you
416;00:35:26,741;00:35:28,825;waiting for, a kiss?
417;00:35:30,528;00:35:32,746;Ready the lady's horse.
418;00:35:42,072;00:35:44,508;They say the best swords
418;00:35:42,072;00:35:44,508;have names.
419;00:35:44,542;00:35:45,959;Any ideas?
420;00:35:51,849;00:35:53,800;Oathkeeper.
421;00:36:05,530;00:36:07,197;Good-bye, Brienne.
422;00:36:30,721;00:36:33,089;Come on, move.
423;00:36:57,481;00:36:59,833;I should never
423;00:36:57,481;00:36:59,833;have taken her away.
424;00:36:59,867;00:37:03,003;She wasn't safe here.
424;00:36:59,867;00:37:03,003;She's not safe out there.
425;00:37:03,037;00:37:04,871;I should have known.
426;00:37:04,922;00:37:07,090;You told us there were
426;00:37:04,922;00:37:07,090;wildlings south of the Wall.
427;00:37:07,124;00:37:09,876;If they're raiding the smaller
427;00:37:07,124;00:37:09,876;villages, Mole's Town could be next.
428;00:37:09,927;00:37:13,296;Castle Black could be next.
428;00:37:09,927;00:37:13,296;I should go back for Gilly.
429;00:37:13,330;00:37:14,931;We have orders. No one's
429;00:37:13,330;00:37:14,931;to leave the castle.
430;00:37:14,966;00:37:17,467;I remember when you disobeyed
430;00:37:14,966;00:37:17,467;orders and rode south to help Robb.
431;00:37:17,501;00:37:19,686;And I remember who came after
431;00:37:17,501;00:37:19,686;me and brought me home.
432;00:37:22,306;00:37:25,175;I know how hard
432;00:37:22,306;00:37:25,175;it is, Sam, believe me.
433;00:37:27,311;00:37:30,030;When you told me about Bran
433;00:37:27,311;00:37:30,030;going beyond the Wall,
434;00:37:30,065;00:37:33,450;all I could think about was getting my
434;00:37:30,065;00:37:33,450;strength back so I could go and find him.
435;00:37:34,852;00:37:37,320;I wish I could have convinced
435;00:37:34,852;00:37:37,320;him to come back with me.
436;00:37:38,956;00:37:41,625;I tried.
436;00:37:38,956;00:37:41,625;Really, I did.
437;00:37:43,911;00:37:46,195;How fast could they travel?
438;00:37:46,213;00:37:49,699;A crippled boy being pulled
438;00:37:46,213;00:37:49,699;on a sledge by a simpleton?
439;00:37:49,717;00:37:51,251;I don't know.
440;00:37:51,302;00:37:53,536;They'd pass
440;00:37:51,302;00:37:53,536;wildling villages.
441;00:37:53,554;00:37:56,589;They could try to find
441;00:37:53,554;00:37:56,589;shelter at one of them.
442;00:37:58,175;00:38:00,877;The wildlings
442;00:37:58,175;00:38:00,877;have joined up with Mance.
443;00:38:00,895;00:38:04,180;Every village or sheltered
443;00:38:00,895;00:38:04,180;place will be deserted.
444;00:38:07,685;00:38:09,653;Except...
445;00:38:12,890;00:38:15,225;Craster's?
446;00:38:15,259;00:38:17,694;You think Bran
446;00:38:15,259;00:38:17,694;might have found--
447;00:38:17,728;00:38:20,163;Snow.
448;00:38:20,197;00:38:21,831;I don't mean
448;00:38:20,197;00:38:21,831;to interrupt.
449;00:38:21,866;00:38:24,534;Thorne wants to see you.
450;00:38:27,404;00:38:30,674;Your foray
450;00:38:27,404;00:38:30,674;to Craster's Keep,
451;00:38:30,708;00:38:32,759;I'll sanction it.
452;00:38:32,793;00:38:36,680;But I won't order
452;00:38:32,793;00:38:36,680;anyone to go with you.
453;00:38:36,714;00:38:39,382;Volunteers only.
454;00:38:39,416;00:38:41,551;Thank you, Ser Alliser.
455;00:38:51,729;00:38:54,064;Ahem, brothers.
456;00:39:05,576;00:39:08,078;I'm going beyond the Wall
456;00:39:05,576;00:39:08,078;to Craster's Keep.
457;00:39:08,112;00:39:12,465;I'm going to capture the mutineers
457;00:39:08,112;00:39:12,465;holed up there or kill them.
458;00:39:12,500;00:39:15,585;I'm asking for volunteers
458;00:39:12,500;00:39:15,585;to come with me.
459;00:39:17,287;00:39:19,923;There's 60 miles of wilderness
459;00:39:17,287;00:39:19,923;between here and Craster's
460;00:39:19,974;00:39:22,792;and Mance Rayder has an army
460;00:39:19,974;00:39:22,792;bearing down on us,
461;00:39:22,810;00:39:24,894;but we have to do this.
462;00:39:24,929;00:39:28,181;Our survival
462;00:39:24,929;00:39:28,181;may depend on
463;00:39:28,232;00:39:31,067;us getting to these mutineers
463;00:39:28,232;00:39:31,067;before Mance does.
464;00:39:31,102;00:39:34,771;They know the Wall.
464;00:39:31,102;00:39:34,771;They know our defenses.
465;00:39:34,805;00:39:37,774;If Mance learns what
465;00:39:34,805;00:39:37,774;they know, we're lost.
466;00:39:40,244;00:39:42,579;But if that's not enough,
467;00:39:42,613;00:39:45,081;then consider this.
468;00:39:45,116;00:39:47,450;If the Night's Watch
468;00:39:45,116;00:39:47,450;are truly brothers,
469;00:39:47,484;00:39:50,453;then Lord Commander Mormont
469;00:39:47,484;00:39:50,453;was our father.
470;00:39:51,705;00:39:53,790;He lived and died
470;00:39:51,705;00:39:53,790;for the Watch
471;00:39:53,841;00:39:56,325;and he was betrayed
471;00:39:53,841;00:39:56,325;by his own men.
472;00:39:56,377;00:39:58,044;Stabbed in the back
472;00:39:56,377;00:39:58,044;by cowards.
473;00:39:58,095;00:40:00,013;He deserved far better.
474;00:40:00,047;00:40:03,600;All we can give him now
474;00:40:00,047;00:40:03,600;is justice.
475;00:40:05,002;00:40:06,886;Who will join me?
476;00:40:56,570;00:40:59,189;I can't let a recruit
476;00:40:56,570;00:40:59,189;come north of the Wall.
477;00:40:59,223;00:41:01,491;Then let me say my vows.
478;00:41:01,525;00:41:04,744;If it's a fight you're heading for,
478;00:41:01,525;00:41:04,744;then you need men who know how.
479;00:41:17,241;00:41:19,092;Thank you, brothers.
480;00:41:26,800;00:41:28,885;No, don't.
481;00:41:28,919;00:41:31,688;Don't, please.
482;00:41:31,722;00:41:33,806;Please don't. Ow!
483;00:41:33,858;00:41:35,775;You're hurting me.
484;00:41:41,448;00:41:45,401;Karl Tanner
484;00:41:41,448;00:41:45,401;from Gin Alley
485;00:41:45,435;00:41:48,571;drinking wine
485;00:41:45,435;00:41:48,571;from the skull
486;00:41:48,605;00:41:52,075;of Jeor fucking Mormont.
487;00:41:58,282;00:42:02,418;Any command for us,
487;00:41:58,282;00:42:02,418;Lord Commander?
488;00:42:02,469;00:42:05,004;What's that?
489;00:42:05,055;00:42:07,473;Fuck 'em
489;00:42:05,055;00:42:07,473;till they're dead?
490;00:42:07,508;00:42:11,060;Did you hear that, boys?
491;00:42:11,095;00:42:13,730;Fuck 'em
491;00:42:11,095;00:42:13,730;till they're dead.
492;00:42:20,304;00:42:21,654;Rast.
493;00:42:27,144;00:42:29,412;Go outside
493;00:42:27,144;00:42:29,412;and feed the beast.
494;00:42:29,446;00:42:31,781;We should kill that thing.
495;00:42:32,917;00:42:35,785;You should shut
495;00:42:32,917;00:42:35,785;your fucking hole,
496;00:42:35,819;00:42:38,821;ugly little cunt.
497;00:42:38,839;00:42:42,258;You look like
497;00:42:38,839;00:42:42,258;a fucking ballsack.
498;00:42:42,293;00:42:45,044;Ugly. Look at your
498;00:42:42,293;00:42:45,044;stupid cunt face.
499;00:42:45,095;00:42:48,631;I could piss in any gutter
499;00:42:45,095;00:42:48,631;and soak five of you.
500;00:42:50,434;00:42:54,053;Know how much they paid me to
500;00:42:50,434;00:42:54,053;kill a man in King's Landing?
501;00:42:54,104;00:42:56,689;Seven silvers.
502;00:42:56,724;00:43:00,476;They told me a man's name and that
502;00:42:56,724;00:43:00,476;man never saw daylight again.
503;00:43:00,510;00:43:03,279;None of them cocksuckers
503;00:43:00,510;00:43:03,279;got away from me.
504;00:43:07,184;00:43:09,869;Haven't lost a fight
504;00:43:07,184;00:43:09,869;since I was nine.
505;00:43:11,622;00:43:13,740;Maybe it's time.
506;00:43:13,791;00:43:16,525;What do you think, eh?
507;00:43:16,543;00:43:19,629;Maybe you're the man.
508;00:43:19,663;00:43:22,799;Eh, cunt?
509;00:43:25,052;00:43:27,503;I wouldn't stand a chance.
510;00:43:28,389;00:43:29,589;None of us would.
511;00:43:29,640;00:43:32,675;I was a fucking legend
511;00:43:29,640;00:43:32,675;in Gin Alley.
512;00:43:32,709;00:43:35,812;A fucking legend!
513;00:43:35,846;00:43:37,430;I would take any knight--
514;00:43:37,481;00:43:40,216;any knight, any time.
515;00:43:40,234;00:43:43,903;Fucking cunts in steel plate.
515;00:43:40,234;00:43:43,903;Fucking cowards.
516;00:43:52,363;00:43:55,915;A gift for the gods.
516;00:43:52,363;00:43:55,915;A gift for the gods.
517;00:43:55,949;00:43:57,533;A gift for the gods.
518;00:43:57,567;00:43:59,085;What the fuck is that?
519;00:43:59,119;00:44:02,288;Craster's last child.
519;00:43:59,119;00:44:02,288;A boy.
520;00:44:02,339;00:44:03,873;What am I supposed
520;00:44:02,339;00:44:03,873;to do with him?
521;00:44:03,907;00:44:06,742;What did Craster
521;00:44:03,907;00:44:06,742;do with 'em?
522;00:44:06,760;00:44:09,962;Kill 'em before they could grow
522;00:44:06,760;00:44:09,962;up and do the same to him?
523;00:44:11,348;00:44:13,049;All right.
524;00:44:16,470;00:44:18,104;Don't need another
524;00:44:16,470;00:44:18,104;mouth to feed.
525;00:44:18,138;00:44:21,357;Hand him over.
525;00:44:18,138;00:44:21,357;He didn't kill them.
526;00:44:21,392;00:44:24,060;He offered them.
526;00:44:21,392;00:44:24,060;To who?
527;00:44:24,111;00:44:26,279;To the gods.

549;00:48:46,690;00:48:49,375;Summer, he's hurt. They've
549;00:48:46,690;00:48:49,375;caught him in a trap.

562;00:49:35,372;00:49:37,039;where the cage was?
563;00:49:37,073;00:49:39,625;The east side
