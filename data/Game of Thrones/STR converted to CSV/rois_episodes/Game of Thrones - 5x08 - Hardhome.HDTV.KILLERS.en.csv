7;00:02:04,136;00:02:06,805;Your Grace,
7;00:02:04,136;00:02:06,805;I want to say...
8;00:02:06,839;00:02:08,773;You will not speak.
9;00:02:10,709;00:02:12,710;How do I know you are
9;00:02:10,709;00:02:12,710;who you say you are?
10;00:02:12,745;00:02:15,547;If only I were otherwise.
11;00:02:15,581;00:02:18,349;If you are Tyrion Lannister,
11;00:02:15,581;00:02:18,349;why shouldn't I kill you
12;00:02:18,384;00:02:20,685;to pay your family back
12;00:02:18,384;00:02:20,685;for what it did to mine?
13;00:02:20,719;00:02:23,388;You want revenge
13;00:02:20,719;00:02:23,388;against the Lannisters?
14;00:02:23,456;00:02:25,790;I killed my mother
14;00:02:23,456;00:02:25,790;Joanna Lannister
15;00:02:25,825;00:02:27,659;on the day I was born.
16;00:02:27,693;00:02:31,229;I killed my father Tywin Lannister with
16;00:02:27,693;00:02:31,229;a bolt to the heart.
17;00:02:31,263;00:02:33,898;I am the greatest
17;00:02:31,263;00:02:33,898;Lannister killer of our time.
18;00:02:33,933;00:02:36,067;So I should welcome you
18;00:02:33,933;00:02:36,067;into my service
19;00:02:36,101;00:02:38,336;because you murdered members
19;00:02:36,101;00:02:38,336;of your own family?
20;00:02:39,572;00:02:42,106;Into your service?
21;00:02:42,141;00:02:45,076;Your Grace, we have
21;00:02:42,141;00:02:45,076;only just met.
22;00:02:45,110;00:02:47,445;It's too soon to know
22;00:02:45,110;00:02:47,445;if you deserve my service.
23;00:02:47,513;00:02:50,315;If you'd rather return
23;00:02:47,513;00:02:50,315;to the fighting pits,
24;00:02:50,349;00:02:52,584;just say the word.
25;00:02:54,720;00:02:57,255;When I was a young man,
25;00:02:54,720;00:02:57,255;I heard a story
26;00:02:57,289;00:03:00,758;about a baby born
26;00:02:57,289;00:03:00,758;during the worst storm in living memory.
27;00:03:00,793;00:03:02,794;She had no wealth,
27;00:03:00,793;00:03:02,794;no lands, no army,
28;00:03:02,828;00:03:06,231;only a name
28;00:03:02,828;00:03:06,231;and a handful of supporters,
29;00:03:06,265;00:03:09,767;most of whom probably thought they
29;00:03:06,265;00:03:09,767;could use that name to benefit themselves.
30;00:03:09,802;00:03:12,370;They kept her alive,
30;00:03:09,802;00:03:12,370;moving her from place to place,
31;00:03:12,404;00:03:15,573;often hours ahead of the men
31;00:03:12,404;00:03:15,573;who'd been sent to kill her.
32;00:03:15,608;00:03:18,910;She was eventually sold off to
32;00:03:15,608;00:03:18,910;some warlord on the edge of the world
33;00:03:18,978;00:03:21,179;and that appeared
33;00:03:18,978;00:03:21,179;to be that.
34;00:03:21,213;00:03:23,214;And then
34;00:03:21,213;00:03:23,214;a few years later,
35;00:03:23,249;00:03:25,550;the most well-informed
35;00:03:23,249;00:03:25,550;person I knew
36;00:03:25,618;00:03:28,453;told me that this girl
36;00:03:25,618;00:03:28,453;without wealth, lands, or armies
37;00:03:28,487;00:03:31,689;had somehow acquired all three
37;00:03:28,487;00:03:31,689;in a very short span of time,
38;00:03:31,724;00:03:33,725;along with three dragons.
39;00:03:33,759;00:03:35,793;He thought
39;00:03:33,759;00:03:35,793;she was our best,
40;00:03:35,828;00:03:38,730;last chance to build
40;00:03:35,828;00:03:38,730;a better world.
41;00:03:40,165;00:03:42,867;I thought you were worth
41;00:03:40,165;00:03:42,867;meeting at the very least.
42;00:03:42,902;00:03:44,369;And why are you
42;00:03:42,902;00:03:44,369;worth meeting?
43;00:03:44,403;00:03:46,204;Why should I spend
43;00:03:44,403;00:03:46,204;my time listening to you?
44;00:03:46,238;00:03:49,340;Because you cannot build
44;00:03:46,238;00:03:49,340;a better world on your own.
45;00:03:49,375;00:03:52,777;You have no one at your side who
45;00:03:49,375;00:03:52,777;understands the land you want to rule.
46;00:03:52,811;00:03:54,812;The strengths
46;00:03:52,811;00:03:54,812;and weaknesses of the houses
47;00:03:54,847;00:03:56,147;that will either
47;00:03:54,847;00:03:56,147;join or oppose you.
48;00:03:56,181;00:03:59,183;I will have
48;00:03:56,181;00:03:59,183;a very large army
49;00:03:59,218;00:04:00,785;and very large dragons.
50;00:04:00,819;00:04:04,389;Killing and politics
50;00:04:00,819;00:04:04,389;aren't always the same thing.
51;00:04:04,423;00:04:06,357;When I served
51;00:04:04,423;00:04:06,357;as Hand of the King,
52;00:04:06,392;00:04:09,027;I did quite well with the latter
52;00:04:06,392;00:04:09,027;considering the king in question
53;00:04:09,061;00:04:11,362;preferred torturing animals
53;00:04:09,061;00:04:11,362;to leading his people.
54;00:04:12,598;00:04:14,465;I could do
54;00:04:12,598;00:04:14,465;an even better job
55;00:04:14,500;00:04:16,768;advising a ruler
55;00:04:14,500;00:04:16,768;worth the name.
56;00:04:16,802;00:04:19,170;If that is indeed
56;00:04:16,802;00:04:19,170;what you are.
57;00:04:19,204;00:04:21,472;So you want
57;00:04:19,204;00:04:21,472;to advise me?
58;00:04:23,609;00:04:25,710;Very well.
59;00:04:27,112;00:04:28,646;What would you
59;00:04:27,112;00:04:28,646;have me do with him?
60;00:04:30,382;00:04:34,085;I swore I would kill him
60;00:04:30,382;00:04:34,085;if he ever returned.
61;00:04:34,119;00:04:36,020;I know.
62;00:04:39,458;00:04:43,394;Why should the people
62;00:04:39,458;00:04:43,394;trust a queen who can't keep her promises?
63;00:04:46,465;00:04:49,200;Whomever Ser Jorah
63;00:04:46,465;00:04:49,200;was when he started informing on you,
64;00:04:49,234;00:04:52,303;he is no longer that man.
65;00:04:52,338;00:04:54,372;I can't remember
65;00:04:52,338;00:04:54,372;ever seeing a sane man
66;00:04:54,473;00:04:56,774;as devoted to anything
66;00:04:54,473;00:04:56,774;as he is to serving you.
67;00:04:56,809;00:04:59,877;He claims he would kill
67;00:04:56,809;00:04:59,877;for you and die for you
68;00:04:59,912;00:05:02,614;and nothing I ever witnessed
68;00:04:59,912;00:05:02,614;gives me reason to doubt him.
69;00:05:06,552;00:05:08,686;And yet he did
69;00:05:06,552;00:05:08,686;betray you.
70;00:05:21,166;00:05:23,801;Did he have an opportunity
70;00:05:21,166;00:05:23,801;to confess his betrayal?
71;00:05:23,836;00:05:26,070;Yes.
72;00:05:26,105;00:05:28,139;Many opportunities.
73;00:05:28,207;00:05:30,808;And did he?
74;00:05:30,843;00:05:35,213;No, not until
74;00:05:30,843;00:05:35,213;forced to do so.
75;00:05:39,918;00:05:41,853;He worships you.
76;00:05:41,887;00:05:44,689;He is in love
76;00:05:41,887;00:05:44,689;with you, I think.
77;00:05:44,723;00:05:47,025;But he did not trust you
77;00:05:44,723;00:05:47,025;with the truth.
78;00:05:47,059;00:05:48,559;An unpleasant truth
78;00:05:47,059;00:05:48,559;to be sure,
79;00:05:48,627;00:05:51,062;but one of great
79;00:05:48,627;00:05:51,062;significance to you.
80;00:05:51,096;00:05:54,232;He did not trust that you would
80;00:05:51,096;00:05:54,232;be wise enough to forgive him.
81;00:05:55,367;00:05:57,268;So I should kill him?
82;00:05:58,570;00:06:00,638;A ruler who kills
82;00:05:58,570;00:06:00,638;those devoted to her
83;00:06:00,673;00:06:03,374;is not a ruler
83;00:06:00,673;00:06:03,374;who inspires devotion.
84;00:06:03,409;00:06:05,576;And you're going to need
84;00:06:03,409;00:06:05,576;to inspire devotion,
85;00:06:05,611;00:06:09,447;a lot of it, if you're ever going to rule
85;00:06:05,611;00:06:09,447;across the Narrow Sea.
86;00:06:11,083;00:06:14,352;But you cannot have him
86;00:06:11,083;00:06:14,352;by your side when you do.
87;00:06:19,725;00:06:22,060;Remove Ser Jorah
87;00:06:19,725;00:06:22,060;from the city.
88;00:07:19,785;00:07:21,786;
89;00:07:33,098;00:07:34,799;Confess.
90;00:07:34,833;00:07:37,068;My son.
91;00:07:38,704;00:07:41,139;Let me speak to...
92;00:07:41,173;00:07:42,440;Confess.
93;00:07:42,474;00:07:44,375;I meant it.
94;00:07:44,409;00:07:48,179;My face will be
94;00:07:44,409;00:07:48,179;the last thing you see...
95;00:07:53,886;00:07:56,187;
96;00:07:58,056;00:08:00,625;
97;00:08:02,528;00:08:04,462;
98;00:08:04,496;00:08:08,199;My name is Lanna.
98;00:08:04,496;00:08:08,199;I'm an orphan.
99;00:08:09,802;00:08:11,736;When I was eight,
99;00:08:09,802;00:08:11,736;I begged enough money
100;00:08:11,770;00:08:13,771;to buy my first
100;00:08:11,770;00:08:13,771;bucket of oysters.
101;00:08:13,806;00:08:18,109;I sold that bucket and made
101;00:08:13,806;00:08:18,109;enough money to buy two more.
102;00:08:18,143;00:08:20,044;
103;00:08:20,078;00:08:23,581;It took a while,
103;00:08:20,078;00:08:23,581;but I finally saved enough
104;00:08:23,615;00:08:25,716;to buy myself
104;00:08:23,615;00:08:25,716;an oyster cart.
105;00:08:25,751;00:08:27,552;Now every morning,
106;00:08:27,586;00:08:29,687;I make my way
106;00:08:27,586;00:08:29,687;down to the canals.
107;00:08:31,723;00:08:34,959;I pass the fish mongers
107;00:08:31,723;00:08:34,959;and the bakers.
108;00:08:40,032;00:08:41,699;I usually see Lhara,
109;00:08:41,733;00:08:44,769;my first customer of the day
109;00:08:41,733;00:08:44,769;on her way home.
110;00:08:46,205;00:08:49,574;Then I turn left
110;00:08:46,205;00:08:49,574;onto Moonsinger Lane
111;00:08:49,608;00:08:52,009;
112;00:08:52,044;00:08:55,179;Turn left
112;00:08:52,044;00:08:55,179;onto Ragman Lane
113;00:08:55,214;00:08:56,714;where I do
113;00:08:55,214;00:08:56,714;most of my trade.
114;00:08:56,748;00:08:58,983;Lanna is very impressive.
115;00:08:59,017;00:09:01,686;Very industrious.
116;00:09:01,720;00:09:04,422;She will make a fine servant
116;00:09:01,720;00:09:04,422;for the Many-Faced God.
117;00:09:04,456;00:09:06,457;How will she serve him?
118;00:09:06,491;00:09:09,927;She will no longer
118;00:09:06,491;00:09:09,927;turn left onto Ragman Lane.
119;00:09:09,962;00:09:12,363;She will turn right
119;00:09:09,962;00:09:12,363;and go to Ragman Harbor.
120;00:09:12,397;00:09:13,965;What will she do there?
121;00:09:14,032;00:09:16,033;She will see.
122;00:09:16,068;00:09:18,970;See what?
123;00:09:19,004;00:09:21,539;How can a man
123;00:09:19,004;00:09:21,539;tell a girl this?
124;00:09:21,607;00:09:22,840;If he knew
124;00:09:21,607;00:09:22,840;what she would see,
125;00:09:22,875;00:09:25,343;there would be
125;00:09:22,875;00:09:25,343;no reason to send her.
126;00:09:25,377;00:09:28,012;Oysters, clams,
126;00:09:25,377;00:09:28,012;and cockles!

136;00:10:30,709;00:10:33,277;without a scratch on me.
137;00:10:39,952;00:10:41,385;Can't do it.

141;00:10:47,726;00:10:49,493;I've three children.

142;00:10:49,528;00:10:50,761;Come on.
143;00:10:50,796;00:10:52,530;They've nothing

149;00:11:09,448;00:11:12,683;to its destination.
150;00:11:12,718;00:11:15,119;It is a strange wager
150;00:11:12,718;00:11:15,119;for the captain.
151;00:11:15,153;00:11:17,788;He only wins

152;00:11:19,891;00:11:22,927;So why would a captain make the wager
152;00:11:19,891;00:11:22,927;in the first place?

157;00:11:39,878;00:11:42,113;and decides he does not
157;00:11:39,878;00:11:42,113;have to pay after all.

169;00:12:20,419;00:12:24,121;A gift for the thin man.

171;00:12:46,211;00:12:49,280;Perhaps she is,

259;00:17:57,989;00:18:00,424;I couldn't find them.
260;00:18:06,798;00:18:08,732;It was two farm boys.
261;00:18:12,737;00:18:15,839;I killed them and burned them
261;00:18:12,737;00:18:15,839;so no one would know.
262;00:18:20,712;00:18:23,313;You didn't?
263;00:18:23,348;00:18:25,582;Do you know where they went,
263;00:18:23,348;00:18:25,582;Bran and Rickon?
264;00:18:25,617;00:18:27,217;I can't talk
264;00:18:25,617;00:18:27,217;to you anymore.
265;00:18:27,252;00:18:28,986;Theon, you have to tell me.
265;00:18:27,252;00:18:28,986;Do you have any idea where...
266;00:18:29,053;00:18:31,488;Not Theon! Reek!
267;00:18:33,258;00:18:35,125;
268;00:18:36,961;00:18:39,797;Our scouts tell us
268;00:18:36,961;00:18:39,797;he's got no more than 6,000 men.
269;00:18:39,831;00:18:42,299;More than half of those
269;00:18:39,831;00:18:42,299;are mounted, however.
270;00:18:42,333;00:18:45,302;And how high do
270;00:18:42,333;00:18:45,302;Stannis's horses jump?
271;00:18:45,336;00:18:47,704;Our walls have been
271;00:18:45,336;00:18:47,704;fully repaired.
272;00:18:47,739;00:18:49,706;The gates have been
272;00:18:47,739;00:18:49,706;reinforced.
273;00:18:49,741;00:18:52,810;We have enough food
273;00:18:49,741;00:18:52,810;for six months.
274;00:18:52,844;00:18:56,647;We are more prepared
274;00:18:52,844;00:18:56,647;for a siege than they could ever be.
275;00:18:56,681;00:18:59,283;All we have to do
275;00:18:56,681;00:18:59,283;is wait for them to freeze,
276;00:18:59,317;00:19:02,152;starve, and mutiny.
277;00:19:05,190;00:19:06,356;You disagree?
278;00:19:06,391;00:19:08,725;Stannis isn't
278;00:19:06,391;00:19:08,725;from the North.
279;00:19:08,760;00:19:10,794;You are, Father.
280;00:19:10,829;00:19:14,064;I think you're missing an opportunity
280;00:19:10,829;00:19:14,064;to show the people of the North
281;00:19:14,098;00:19:16,767;how House Bolton
281;00:19:14,098;00:19:16,767;treats southern invaders.
282;00:19:16,801;00:19:18,068;And what
282;00:19:16,801;00:19:18,068;do you recommend?
283;00:19:18,102;00:19:19,403;That we not sit
283;00:19:18,102;00:19:19,403;and wait for Stannis
284;00:19:19,437;00:19:21,972;to decide what sort of fight
284;00:19:19,437;00:19:21,972;this is going to be.
285;00:19:22,006;00:19:24,074;That we hit first
285;00:19:22,006;00:19:24,074;and hit hard
286;00:19:24,108;00:19:26,477;and leave a feast
286;00:19:24,108;00:19:26,477;for the crows.
287;00:19:26,511;00:19:29,513;A smart commander does not
287;00:19:26,511;00:19:29,513;abandon a defensive advantage.
288;00:19:29,547;00:19:31,915;As long as we stay
288;00:19:29,547;00:19:31,915;behind these walls,
289;00:19:31,950;00:19:33,250;they can't touch us.
290;00:19:33,284;00:19:35,185;Not to mention
290;00:19:33,284;00:19:35,185;that the snow is so deep,
291;00:19:35,220;00:19:36,954;we couldn't get
291;00:19:35,220;00:19:36,954;an army through to engage them
292;00:19:36,988;00:19:38,288;even if we wanted to.
293;00:19:38,323;00:19:40,591;I don't need an army.
294;00:19:40,625;00:19:43,126;I need 20 good men.
295;00:19:50,969;00:19:52,703;So, have you
295;00:19:50,969;00:19:52,703;decided yet?
296;00:19:52,737;00:19:55,205;Whether I'm worthy
296;00:19:52,737;00:19:55,205;of your service?
297;00:19:57,242;00:20:00,744;Have you decided yet
297;00:19:57,242;00:20:00,744;whether you're going to have me killed?
298;00:20:00,778;00:20:02,980;It's probably
298;00:20:00,778;00:20:02,980;my safest option.
299;00:20:05,850;00:20:08,051;I can see why
299;00:20:05,850;00:20:08,051;you would think so.
300;00:20:08,086;00:20:10,287;It's what your father
300;00:20:08,086;00:20:10,287;would have done.
301;00:20:11,556;00:20:12,996;And what would
301;00:20:11,556;00:20:12,996;your father have done?
302;00:20:15,093;00:20:16,660;My father,
303;00:20:16,694;00:20:19,663;who publically
303;00:20:16,694;00:20:19,663;sentenced me to death?
304;00:20:19,731;00:20:22,232;I'd say his thoughts on having me killed
304;00:20:19,731;00:20:22,232;were abundantly clear.
305;00:20:22,267;00:20:23,834;Is that why
305;00:20:22,267;00:20:23,834;you killed him?
306;00:20:27,205;00:20:30,474;Someday if you decide
306;00:20:27,205;00:20:30,474;not to execute me,
307;00:20:30,508;00:20:32,676;I'll tell you all about
307;00:20:30,508;00:20:32,676;why I killed my father.
308;00:20:32,710;00:20:35,946;And on that day,
308;00:20:32,710;00:20:35,946;should it ever come,
309;00:20:35,980;00:20:38,282;we'll need
309;00:20:35,980;00:20:38,282;more wine than this.
310;00:20:40,618;00:20:43,020;I know
310;00:20:40,618;00:20:43,020;what my father was.
311;00:20:43,087;00:20:45,589;What he did.
312;00:20:45,657;00:20:47,958;I know the Mad King
312;00:20:45,657;00:20:47,958;earned his name.
313;00:20:50,728;00:20:53,764;So, here we sit.
314;00:20:53,831;00:20:56,800;Two terrible children
314;00:20:53,831;00:20:56,800;of two terrible fathers.
315;00:20:56,834;00:20:58,535;I'm terrible?
316;00:20:58,570;00:21:00,704;I've heard stories.
317;00:21:00,738;00:21:04,074;Why did you travel to the far side
317;00:21:00,738;00:21:04,074;of the world to meet someone terrible?
318;00:21:04,075;00:21:06,199;To see if you were
318;00:21:04,075;00:21:06,199;the right kind of terrible.
319;00:21:06,200;00:21:06,840;Which kind is that?
320;00:21:06,844;00:21:09,947;The kind that prevents
320;00:21:06,844;00:21:09,947;your people from being even more so.
321;00:21:11,950;00:21:14,017;Well, I did reopen
321;00:21:11,950;00:21:14,017;the fighting pits.
322;00:21:14,052;00:21:16,853;Under my rule, murder will once again
322;00:21:14,052;00:21:16,853;become entertainment.
323;00:21:16,888;00:21:18,622;Yes, that was wise.
324;00:21:18,656;00:21:21,925;And you agreed to marry someone
324;00:21:18,656;00:21:21,925;you loathe for the greater good.
325;00:21:21,993;00:21:24,828;Very impressive.
326;00:21:24,862;00:21:27,397;My own sister married someone
326;00:21:24,862;00:21:27,397;she loathed as well,
327;00:21:27,432;00:21:29,967;though not by choice
327;00:21:27,432;00:21:29,967;and certainly not
328;00:21:30,001;00:21:31,935;for the greater good,
328;00:21:30,001;00:21:31,935;gods forbid.
329;00:21:31,970;00:21:33,704;She ended up
329;00:21:31,970;00:21:33,704;having him killed.
330;00:21:35,540;00:21:37,941;Perhaps it won't
330;00:21:35,540;00:21:37,941;come to that.
331;00:21:45,550;00:21:48,652;It's not impossible that Varys was right
331;00:21:45,550;00:21:48,652;about you after all.
332;00:21:48,686;00:21:51,855;Varys?
332;00:21:48,686;00:21:51,855;King Robert's spymaster?
333;00:21:51,923;00:21:55,425;Yes, he's the one
333;00:21:51,923;00:21:55,425;who convinced me to come find you.
334;00:21:55,460;00:21:57,060;He was my travelling
334;00:21:55,460;00:21:57,060;companion
335;00:21:57,095;00:21:59,396;before Ser Jorah seized
335;00:21:57,095;00:21:59,396;that role for himself.
336;00:21:59,430;00:22:02,099;Jorah sent my secrets
336;00:21:59,430;00:22:02,099;to Varys.
337;00:22:02,133;00:22:06,480;For 20 years the Spider oversaw
337;00:22:02,133;00:22:06,480;the campaign to find and kill me.
338;00:22:06,481;00:22:08,673;He did what he had
338;00:22:06,481;00:22:08,673;to do to survive.
339;00:22:08,706;00:22:11,842;He did a lot of other things as well,
339;00:22:08,706;00:22:11,842;things he didn't have to do.
340;00:22:11,876;00:22:15,779;I suspect he's the main reason
340;00:22:11,876;00:22:15,779;you weren't slaughtered in your crib.
341;00:22:15,813;00:22:17,581;But you trust him?
342;00:22:17,615;00:22:19,116;Yes, oddly.
343;00:22:19,150;00:22:22,386;He may be the only person
343;00:22:19,150;00:22:22,386;in the world I trust.
344;00:22:22,420;00:22:24,287;Except my brother.
345;00:22:24,322;00:22:27,357;The brother
345;00:22:24,322;00:22:27,357;who killed my father?
346;00:22:27,392;00:22:28,458;That's the one.
347;00:22:28,526;00:22:30,293;Perhaps I will have you
347;00:22:28,526;00:22:30,293;killed after all.
348;00:22:30,328;00:22:32,529;Your queenly prerogative.
349;00:22:34,632;00:22:37,167;I had given up on life
350;00:22:37,201;00:22:40,637;until Varys convinced me
350;00:22:37,201;00:22:40,637;you might be worth living for.
351;00:22:40,705;00:22:43,106;If you chop off
351;00:22:40,705;00:22:43,106;my head, well,
352;00:22:43,141;00:22:45,175;my final days
352;00:22:43,141;00:22:45,175;were interesting.
353;00:22:51,349;00:22:53,316;I'm not
353;00:22:51,349;00:22:53,316;going to kill you.
354;00:22:55,286;00:22:58,121;No? Banish me?
355;00:22:58,156;00:22:59,890;No.
356;00:22:59,924;00:23:01,591;So if I'm not going
356;00:22:59,924;00:23:01,591;to be murdered
357;00:23:01,626;00:23:03,026;and I'm not going
357;00:23:01,626;00:23:03,026;to be banished...
358;00:23:03,061;00:23:04,494;You're going
358;00:23:03,061;00:23:04,494;to advise me.
359;00:23:06,264;00:23:08,632;While you can still speak
359;00:23:06,264;00:23:08,632;in complete sentences.
360;00:23:12,570;00:23:13,904;Advise you on what?
361;00:23:13,938;00:23:15,505;How to get
361;00:23:13,938;00:23:15,505;what I want.
362;00:23:15,540;00:23:18,075;The Iron Throne.
363;00:23:18,109;00:23:21,078;Perhaps you should try
363;00:23:18,109;00:23:21,078;wanting something else.
364;00:23:21,112;00:23:23,580;If I want jokes,
364;00:23:21,112;00:23:23,580;I'll get myself a proper fool.
365;00:23:23,614;00:23:25,916;I'm not entirely joking.
366;00:23:25,950;00:23:28,418;There's more to the world
366;00:23:25,950;00:23:28,418;than Westeros after all.
367;00:23:28,453;00:23:32,789;How many hundreds of thousands of lives
367;00:23:28,453;00:23:32,789;have you changed for the better here?
368;00:23:32,824;00:23:34,725;Perhaps this
368;00:23:32,824;00:23:34,725;is where you belong,
369;00:23:34,759;00:23:36,760;where you can do
369;00:23:34,759;00:23:36,760;the most good.
370;00:23:38,930;00:23:41,665;I fought so that no child
370;00:23:38,930;00:23:41,665;born into Slaver's Bay
371;00:23:41,699;00:23:44,801;would ever know
371;00:23:41,699;00:23:44,801;what it meant to be bought or sold.
372;00:23:44,836;00:23:48,371;I will continue
372;00:23:44,836;00:23:48,371;that fight here and beyond.
373;00:23:48,406;00:23:49,973;But this is not my home.
374;00:23:50,007;00:23:52,743;When you get back to your home,
374;00:23:50,007;00:23:52,743;who supports you?
375;00:23:52,777;00:23:54,311;The common people.
376;00:23:54,345;00:23:56,947;Let's be generous
376;00:23:54,345;00:23:56,947;and assume that's going to happen.
377;00:23:56,981;00:23:59,649;Here in Slaver's Bay,
377;00:23:56,981;00:23:59,649;you had the support of the common people

514;00:33:39,409;00:33:41,777;My name's Jon Snow.
515;00:33:43,346;00:33:45,614;I'm Lord Commander
515;00:33:43,346;00:33:45,614;of the Night's Watch.
516;00:33:48,351;00:33:50,686;We're not friends.
517;00:33:50,720;00:33:53,206;We've never been friends.
518;00:33:54,211;00:33:55,864;We won't become
518;00:33:54,211;00:33:55,864;friends today.
519;00:33:58,061;00:34:00,162;This isn't
519;00:33:58,061;00:34:00,162;about friendship.
520;00:34:02,032;00:34:04,199;This is about
520;00:34:02,032;00:34:04,199;survival.
521;00:34:04,234;00:34:06,268;This is about putting
521;00:34:04,234;00:34:06,268;a 700-foot wall
522;00:34:06,303;00:34:08,871;between you
522;00:34:06,303;00:34:08,871;and what's out there.
523;00:34:08,905;00:34:10,606;You built that wall
523;00:34:08,905;00:34:10,606;to keep us out.
524;00:34:10,640;00:34:13,609;Since when do the crows
524;00:34:10,640;00:34:13,609;give two shits if we live?
525;00:34:13,677;00:34:16,512;In normal times we wouldn't.
525;00:34:13,677;00:34:16,512;But these aren't normal times.
526;00:34:16,546;00:34:19,949;The white walkers
526;00:34:16,546;00:34:19,949;don't care if a man's free folk or crow.
527;00:34:19,983;00:34:23,118;We're all the same to them,
527;00:34:19,983;00:34:23,118;meat for their army.
528;00:34:23,186;00:34:25,321;But together
528;00:34:23,186;00:34:25,321;we can beat them.
529;00:34:25,355;00:34:27,489;Beat the white walkers?
530;00:34:27,524;00:34:30,392;Good luck with that.
530;00:34:27,524;00:34:30,392;Run from them, maybe.
531;00:34:40,203;00:34:42,304;It's not a trick.
532;00:34:45,075;00:34:48,143;It's a gift
532;00:34:45,075;00:34:48,143;for those who join us.
533;00:34:53,016;00:34:55,985;Dragonglass.
534;00:34:56,019;00:34:59,021;A man of the Night's Watch
534;00:34:56,019;00:34:59,021;used one of these daggers
535;00:34:59,055;00:35:01,123;to kill a walker.
536;00:35:01,157;00:35:03,592;You saw this?
536;00:35:01,157;00:35:03,592;No.
537;00:35:03,660;00:35:05,194;But I trust the man.
538;00:35:05,228;00:35:07,763;There are old stories
538;00:35:05,228;00:35:07,763;about dragonglass.
539;00:35:07,797;00:35:11,266;There are old stories
539;00:35:07,797;00:35:11,266;about ice spiders as big as hounds.
540;00:35:11,301;00:35:13,469;And with the things
540;00:35:11,301;00:35:13,469;we've seen, you don't believe them?
541;00:35:13,503;00:35:16,305;Come with me and I'll share
541;00:35:13,503;00:35:16,305;these weapons.
542;00:35:16,339;00:35:17,873;Come with you where?
543;00:35:17,907;00:35:19,675;There are good lands
543;00:35:17,907;00:35:19,675;south of the Wall.
544;00:35:19,709;00:35:21,477;The Night's Watch will let you
544;00:35:19,709;00:35:21,477;through the tunnel
545;00:35:21,511;00:35:23,912;and allow your people
545;00:35:21,511;00:35:23,912;to farm those lands.
546;00:35:23,947;00:35:26,982;
547;00:35:27,017;00:35:29,184;I knew Mance Rayder.
548;00:35:29,252;00:35:31,387;He never wanted a war
548;00:35:29,252;00:35:31,387;with the Night's Watch.
549;00:35:31,421;00:35:33,922;He wanted a new life
549;00:35:31,421;00:35:33,922;for his people, for you.
550;00:35:33,957;00:35:36,392;We're prepared
550;00:35:33,957;00:35:36,392;to give you that new life.
551;00:35:36,426;00:35:38,060;If?
552;00:35:38,094;00:35:41,397;If you swear you'll join us
552;00:35:38,094;00:35:41,397;when the real war begins.
553;00:35:43,833;00:35:45,401;Where is Mance?
554;00:35:48,738;00:35:51,507;He died.
554;00:35:48,738;00:35:51,507;How?
555;00:35:56,746;00:35:58,747;I put an arrow
555;00:35:56,746;00:35:58,747;through his heart.
556;00:35:58,782;00:36:01,016;Hey, hey.
557;00:36:01,084;00:36:03,118;Hey, hey, hey,
557;00:36:01,084;00:36:03,118;hey, hey.
558;00:36:05,288;00:36:06,688;Hey, hey, hey.
559;00:36:06,723;00:36:08,357;I say we send
559;00:36:06,723;00:36:08,357;the Lord Commander
560;00:36:08,391;00:36:12,194;back to Castle Black
560;00:36:08,391;00:36:12,194;with no eyes.
561;00:36:13,830;00:36:16,131;Hey, none of you
561;00:36:13,830;00:36:16,131;saw Mance die.
562;00:36:16,199;00:36:17,866;I did.
563;00:36:17,901;00:36:21,303;The southern king
563;00:36:17,901;00:36:21,303;who broke our army, Stannis,
564;00:36:21,337;00:36:23,972;wanted to burn him alive
564;00:36:21,337;00:36:23,972;to send us a message.
565;00:36:24,007;00:36:26,975;Jon Snow defied
565;00:36:24,007;00:36:26,975;that cunt's orders.
566;00:36:28,211;00:36:30,379;His arrow was mercy.
567;00:36:31,481;00:36:32,781;What he did
567;00:36:31,481;00:36:32,781;took courage.
568;00:36:32,816;00:36:34,516;And that's
568;00:36:32,816;00:36:34,516;what we need today,
569;00:36:34,551;00:36:36,185;the courage
569;00:36:34,551;00:36:36,185;to make peace
570;00:36:36,219;00:36:39,455;with men we've been killing
570;00:36:36,219;00:36:39,455;for generations.
571;00:36:39,489;00:36:41,690;I lost my father,
571;00:36:39,489;00:36:41,690;my uncle,
572;00:36:41,724;00:36:44,093;and two brothers
572;00:36:41,724;00:36:44,093;fighting the damn crows.
573;00:36:44,127;00:36:47,229;I'm not asking you
573;00:36:44,127;00:36:47,229;to forget your dead.
574;00:36:47,263;00:36:49,364;I'll never
574;00:36:47,263;00:36:49,364;forget mine.
575;00:36:51,201;00:36:55,471;I lost 50 brothers
575;00:36:51,201;00:36:55,471;the night that Mance attacked the Wall.
576;00:36:56,439;00:36:58,740;But I'm asking you
577;00:36:58,775;00:37:00,843;to think about
577;00:36:58,775;00:37:00,843;your children now.
578;00:37:02,712;00:37:04,346;They'll never have
578;00:37:02,712;00:37:04,346;children of their own
579;00:37:04,380;00:37:06,815;if we don't band together.
580;00:37:06,883;00:37:09,685;The Long Night
580;00:37:06,883;00:37:09,685;is coming
581;00:37:09,719;00:37:11,687;and the dead
581;00:37:09,719;00:37:11,687;come with it.
582;00:37:11,721;00:37:14,423;No clan can stop them.
583;00:37:14,457;00:37:16,291;The free folk
583;00:37:14,457;00:37:16,291;can't stop them.
584;00:37:16,326;00:37:17,726;The Night's Watch
584;00:37:16,326;00:37:17,726;can't stop them.
585;00:37:17,794;00:37:21,196;And all the southern kings
585;00:37:17,794;00:37:21,196;can't stop them.
586;00:37:22,332;00:37:24,933;Only together,
586;00:37:22,332;00:37:24,933;all of us.
587;00:37:24,968;00:37:26,702;And even then
587;00:37:24,968;00:37:26,702;it may not be enough,
588;00:37:26,736;00:37:29,004;but at least we'll give
588;00:37:26,736;00:37:29,004;the fuckers a fight.
589;00:37:44,521;00:37:47,089;You vouch
589;00:37:44,521;00:37:47,089;for this man, Tormund?
590;00:37:49,659;00:37:52,661;He's prettier
590;00:37:49,659;00:37:52,661;than both my daughters,
591;00:37:52,695;00:37:54,563;but he knows
591;00:37:52,695;00:37:54,563;how to fight.
592;00:37:54,597;00:37:57,466;He's young,
592;00:37:54,597;00:37:57,466;but he knows how to lead.
593;00:37:58,968;00:38:00,636;He didn't have
593;00:37:58,968;00:38:00,636;to come to Hardhome.
594;00:38:00,670;00:38:04,806;He came because
594;00:38:00,670;00:38:04,806;he needs us
595;00:38:04,841;00:38:06,875;and we need him.
596;00:38:10,747;00:38:12,781;My ancestors
596;00:38:10,747;00:38:12,781;would spit on me
597;00:38:12,815;00:38:14,950;if I broke bread
597;00:38:12,815;00:38:14,950;with a crow.
598;00:38:14,984;00:38:17,853;So would mine,
598;00:38:14,984;00:38:17,853;but fuck 'em, they're dead.
599;00:38:24,627;00:38:27,196;
600;00:38:27,230;00:38:29,531;I'll never trust
600;00:38:27,230;00:38:29,531;a man in black.
601;00:38:33,636;00:38:36,138;But I trust you,
601;00:38:33,636;00:38:36,138;Tormund.
602;00:38:36,172;00:38:39,508;If you say
602;00:38:36,172;00:38:39,508;this is the way,
603;00:38:39,542;00:38:40,809;we're with you.
604;00:38:44,881;00:38:47,482;This is the way.
605;00:38:48,518;00:38:50,319;I'm with Tormund.
606;00:38:50,353;00:38:52,688;We stay here,
606;00:38:50,353;00:38:52,688;we're dead men.
607;00:38:54,390;00:38:57,392;At least with King Crow,
607;00:38:54,390;00:38:57,392;there's a chance.
608;00:38:57,427;00:39:00,028;
609;00:39:00,096;00:39:03,232;Tormund.
610;00:39:06,269;00:39:09,071;Keep that new life
610;00:39:06,269;00:39:09,071;you want to give us.
611;00:39:11,808;00:39:14,409;And keep your glass,
611;00:39:11,808;00:39:14,409;King Crow.
612;00:39:16,512;00:39:20,249;As soon as you get on
612;00:39:16,512;00:39:20,249;his ships, they're gonna slit your throats
613;00:39:20,283;00:39:23,252;and dump your bodies
613;00:39:20,283;00:39:23,252;to the bottom of the Shivering Sea.
614;00:39:25,255;00:39:27,256;That's our enemy.
615;00:39:28,891;00:39:31,026;That has always
615;00:39:28,891;00:39:31,026;been our enemy.
616;00:39:46,909;00:39:48,710;I fucking hate Thenns.
617;00:39:56,953;00:39:59,388;
618;00:40:08,665;00:40:11,199;Move it.
618;00:40:08,665;00:40:11,199;Be careful.
619;00:40:11,234;00:40:13,101;Move 'em along, now.
619;00:40:11,234;00:40:13,101;Cast-off time.
620;00:40:13,136;00:40:15,103;That's it, come on.
621;00:40:17,807;00:40:20,275;How many are with us?
621;00:40:17,807;00:40:20,275;5,000?
622;00:40:20,310;00:40:22,477;I'm not good
622;00:40:20,310;00:40:22,477;at counting.
623;00:40:23,813;00:40:25,514;We're leaving
623;00:40:23,813;00:40:25,514;too many behind.
624;00:40:25,548;00:40:27,049;The free folk
624;00:40:25,548;00:40:27,049;are stubborn.
625;00:40:27,083;00:40:29,584;You know how long
625;00:40:27,083;00:40:29,584;it took Mance to band them together?
626;00:40:29,619;00:40:32,120;20 fucking years.
627;00:40:32,188;00:40:35,190;And he knew them better
627;00:40:32,188;00:40:35,190;than I ever will.
628;00:40:35,224;00:40:39,494;They're running out of food
628;00:40:35,224;00:40:39,494;and there's nothing to hunt.
629;00:40:39,529;00:40:41,029;They'll come around.
630;00:40:43,866;00:40:46,368;Get yourselves ready.
630;00:40:43,866;00:40:46,368;Aye!
631;00:40:46,402;00:40:48,170;Johnna is gonna
631;00:40:46,402;00:40:48,170;look after you.
632;00:40:48,204;00:40:50,972;She's in charge.
632;00:40:48,204;00:40:50,972;You listen to her.
633;00:40:52,075;00:40:54,676;Take her.
633;00:40:52,075;00:40:54,676;There you are.
