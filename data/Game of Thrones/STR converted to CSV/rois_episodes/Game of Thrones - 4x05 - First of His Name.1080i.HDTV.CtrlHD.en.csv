1;00:03:40,131;00:03:42,149;May the
1;00:03:40,131;00:03:42,149;Warrior grant him courage
2;00:03:42,183;00:03:45,502;and protect him
2;00:03:42,183;00:03:45,502;in these perilous times.
3;00:03:45,520;00:03:47,971;May the Smith grant him strength
4;00:03:48,005;00:03:49,885;that he might bear
4;00:03:48,005;00:03:49,885;this heavy burden.
5;00:03:49,891;00:03:52,109;And may the Crone,
6;00:03:52,143;00:03:54,478;she that knows
6;00:03:52,143;00:03:54,478;the fate of all men,
7;00:03:54,512;00:03:57,114;show him the path he must walk
8;00:03:57,148;00:04:00,567;and guide him through the
8;00:03:57,148;00:04:00,567;dark places that lie ahead.
9;00:04:00,618;00:04:03,904;In the light of the Seven,
9;00:04:00,618;00:04:03,904;I now proclaim Tommen
10;00:04:03,955;00:04:06,790;of the House Baratheon
10;00:04:03,955;00:04:06,790;First of His Name.
11;00:04:06,825;00:04:09,576;King of the Andals
11;00:04:06,825;00:04:09,576;and the First Men
12;00:04:09,627;00:04:12,462;and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
13;00:04:15,583;00:04:17,467;Long may he reign!
14;00:04:17,502;00:04:19,503;Long may he reign!
15;00:04:29,380;00:04:31,265;Special day.
16;00:04:50,034;00:04:51,952;Your Grace.
17;00:04:53,788;00:04:55,789;Your Grace.
18;00:05:19,731;00:05:21,899;Your Grace.
18;00:05:19,731;00:05:21,899;Your Grace.
19;00:05:37,382;00:05:39,533;Your Grace.
20;00:05:42,186;00:05:44,554;There he is.
21;00:05:44,589;00:05:46,790;Long may he reign.
22;00:05:46,808;00:05:48,592;Long may he reign.
23;00:05:52,397;00:05:54,898;He sits the throne
23;00:05:52,397;00:05:54,898;like he was born to it.
24;00:05:54,933;00:05:58,602;Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?
25;00:05:59,604;00:06:01,154;No, he wasn't.
26;00:06:06,661;00:06:09,079;You still mourn for Joffrey?
27;00:06:09,113;00:06:11,314;He was my husband. My king.
28;00:06:11,332;00:06:13,452;He would have been
28;00:06:11,332;00:06:13,452;your nightmare.
29;00:06:16,988;00:06:19,706;Your Grace, I feel...
30;00:06:19,791;00:06:21,892;You knew exactly what he was.
31;00:06:21,926;00:06:24,511;I did, too.
32;00:06:24,545;00:06:25,996;You never love
32;00:06:24,545;00:06:25,996;anything in the world
33;00:06:26,030;00:06:28,432;the way you love
33;00:06:26,030;00:06:28,432;your first child.
34;00:06:30,335;00:06:32,636;Doesn't matter what they do.
35;00:06:35,306;00:06:38,058;And what he did, it shocked me.
36;00:06:40,244;00:06:42,646;Do you think I'm easily shocked?
37;00:06:42,697;00:06:44,081;No.
38;00:06:44,115;00:06:47,517;The things he did shocked me.
39;00:06:54,025;00:06:55,826;He's only a boy.
40;00:06:55,860;00:06:58,361;A good boy. A decent boy.
41;00:06:58,379;00:07:00,247;He always has been.
42;00:07:00,298;00:07:03,467;Who was the last
42;00:07:00,298;00:07:03,467;decent king, I wonder?
43;00:07:03,501;00:07:05,385;He could be the first man
43;00:07:03,501;00:07:05,385;who sits on that throne
44;00:07:05,420;00:07:08,171;in 50 years
44;00:07:05,420;00:07:08,171;to actually deserve it.
45;00:07:09,590;00:07:12,309;It would be some
45;00:07:09,590;00:07:12,309;consolation, wouldn't it?
46;00:07:12,343;00:07:15,379;For all the horror
46;00:07:12,343;00:07:15,379;that put him there.
47;00:07:20,068;00:07:22,619;He will need help...
48;00:07:24,272;00:07:25,989;if he's going to rule well.
49;00:07:26,024;00:07:27,991;He has you.
50;00:07:28,026;00:07:30,610;A mother is not enough.
51;00:07:31,996;00:07:35,198;You're still interested
51;00:07:31,996;00:07:35,198;in being queen, I take it?
52;00:07:35,232;00:07:37,034;Oh.
53;00:07:37,068;00:07:39,119;After all that's happened...
54;00:07:41,756;00:07:45,241;it sounds strange,
54;00:07:41,756;00:07:45,241;I know, but I am...
55;00:07:45,259;00:07:47,677;I haven't even given
55;00:07:45,259;00:07:47,677;any thought to it,
56;00:07:47,712;00:07:49,463;what comes next.
57;00:07:49,514;00:07:52,716;It would be a great
57;00:07:49,514;00:07:52,716;honor, of course.
58;00:07:52,750;00:07:55,852;But I will have to speak
58;00:07:52,750;00:07:55,852;to my father about it.
59;00:07:57,522;00:08:00,223;Yes, speak to your father.
60;00:08:00,257;00:08:03,143;I'll speak to mine.
61;00:08:07,615;00:08:11,284;We may be faced with an alarming
61;00:08:07,615;00:08:11,284;number of weddings soon.
62;00:08:13,071;00:08:15,072;I won't even know
62;00:08:13,071;00:08:15,072;what to call you.
63;00:08:16,407;00:08:17,908;Sister?
64;00:08:19,610;00:08:21,828;Or Mother?
65;00:08:21,879;00:08:24,381;Hmm.
66;00:08:25,400;00:08:27,951;King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.
67;00:08:29,837;00:08:31,405;Murdered at his own wedding.
68;00:08:31,439;00:08:34,808;And we have taken the
68;00:08:31,439;00:08:34,808;Meereenese navy, Your Grace.
69;00:08:34,842;00:08:37,060;The Second Sons took
69;00:08:34,842;00:08:37,060;the Meereenese navy.
70;00:08:37,095;00:08:39,096;Who told you to take the navy?
71;00:08:39,130;00:08:41,264;No one.
72;00:08:41,298;00:08:43,767;So why did you do it?
73;00:08:43,801;00:08:45,921;I heard you liked ships.
74;00:08:49,824;00:08:51,441;How many ships?
75;00:08:51,475;00:08:52,742;93, Your Grace.
76;00:08:52,777;00:08:54,111;How many men can they carry?
77;00:08:54,145;00:08:57,030;9,300, not counting sailors.
78;00:08:57,081;00:08:58,999;Would that be enough
78;00:08:57,081;00:08:58,999;to take King's Landing?
79;00:08:59,033;00:09:00,867;The Lannisters have more.
80;00:09:00,918;00:09:03,286;They've been fighting
80;00:09:00,918;00:09:03,286;Joffrey's wars for years.
81;00:09:03,320;00:09:05,155;They're tired, dispersed.
82;00:09:05,173;00:09:07,457;And now their king is dead.
83;00:09:07,491;00:09:11,094;8,000 Unsullied,
83;00:09:07,491;00:09:11,094;2,000 Second Sons
84;00:09:11,129;00:09:13,630;sailing into Blackwater Bay
85;00:09:13,664;00:09:16,433;and storming the gates
85;00:09:13,664;00:09:16,433;without warning.
86;00:09:19,387;00:09:22,055;It's hard to say.
86;00:09:19,387;00:09:22,055;It could be enough.
87;00:09:22,106;00:09:25,642;But we're not fighting to make
87;00:09:22,106;00:09:25,642;you queen of King's Landing.
88;00:09:25,676;00:09:28,645;10,000 men
88;00:09:25,676;00:09:28,645;can't conquer Westeros.
89;00:09:28,679;00:09:30,347;The old houses
89;00:09:28,679;00:09:30,347;will flock to our queen
90;00:09:30,381;00:09:31,948;when she crosses the Narrow Sea.
91;00:09:31,983;00:09:34,784;The old houses will flock to
91;00:09:31,983;00:09:34,784;whichever side they think will win,
92;00:09:34,819;00:09:36,903;as they always have.
93;00:09:39,040;00:09:41,208;There's other news.
94;00:09:41,242;00:09:43,026;From Yunkai.
95;00:09:43,044;00:09:46,413;Without the Unsullied
95;00:09:43,044;00:09:46,413;to enforce your rule,
96;00:09:46,464;00:09:49,332;the Wise Masters have
96;00:09:46,464;00:09:49,332;retaken control of the city.
97;00:09:49,366;00:09:52,385;They've reenslaved the
97;00:09:49,366;00:09:52,385;freedmen who stayed behind
98;00:09:52,420;00:09:54,554;and sworn to take
98;00:09:52,420;00:09:54,554;revenge against you.
99;00:09:56,174;00:09:57,974;And in Astapor,
100;00:09:58,009;00:10:00,727;the council you installed
100;00:09:58,009;00:10:00,727;to rule over the city
101;00:10:00,761;00:10:03,880;has been overthrown
101;00:10:00,761;00:10:03,880;by a butcher named Cleon
102;00:10:03,898;00:10:07,234;who's declared himself
102;00:10:03,898;00:10:07,234;His Imperial Majesty.
103;00:10:09,237;00:10:11,188;Please leave me.
104;00:10:16,360;00:10:18,495;Not you, Jorah.
105;00:10:30,708;00:10:33,460;It appears my liberation
105;00:10:30,708;00:10:33,460;of Slaver's Bay
106;00:10:33,511;00:10:35,512;isn't going quite as planned.
107;00:10:36,964;00:10:39,432;You could sail for Westeros
108;00:10:39,467;00:10:41,468;and leave it all behind.
109;00:10:41,519;00:10:43,186;A boy sits on the Iron Throne.
110;00:10:43,221;00:10:46,422;A boy many believe to be a
110;00:10:43,221;00:10:46,422;bastard with no right to it.
111;00:10:46,440;00:10:49,276;They've never been
111;00:10:46,440;00:10:49,276;more vulnerable.
112;00:10:49,310;00:10:52,729;You counseled me against
112;00:10:49,310;00:10:52,729;rashness once in Qarth.
113;00:10:52,763;00:10:55,365;I didn't listen.
114;00:10:55,399;00:10:57,534;That all worked out well.
115;00:11:04,392;00:11:07,160;How can I rule seven kingdoms
116;00:11:07,211;00:11:09,913;if I can't control Slaver's Bay?
117;00:11:11,082;00:11:13,967;Why should anyone trust me?
118;00:11:14,051;00:11:16,619;Why should anyone follow me?
119;00:11:16,637;00:11:18,104;You're a Targaryen.
120;00:11:18,139;00:11:20,173;You're the Mother of Dragons.
121;00:11:22,026;00:11:24,594;I need to be more than that.
122;00:11:30,851;00:11:35,772;I will not let those I have
122;00:11:30,851;00:11:35,772;freed slide back into chains.
123;00:11:36,857;00:11:38,775;I will not sail for Westeros.
124;00:11:38,809;00:11:40,810;What, then?
125;00:11:42,246;00:11:44,714;I will do what queens do.
126;00:11:47,785;00:11:49,953;I will rule.
127;00:12:25,373;00:12:27,324;Pull up your hood.
128;00:12:29,660;00:12:31,661;A memorable shade.
129;00:12:32,913;00:12:34,547;But how would they know?
130;00:12:34,582;00:12:38,051;You know what kind of stories
130;00:12:34,582;00:12:38,051;poor men enjoy the most?
131;00:12:38,085;00:12:41,004;Ones about rich girls
131;00:12:38,085;00:12:41,004;they'll never meet.
132;00:12:45,726;00:12:47,894;Is this the only way
132;00:12:45,726;00:12:47,894;into the Eyrie?
133;00:12:47,928;00:12:50,096;The mountains are impassable.
134;00:12:50,147;00:12:51,708;If you want to get to the Eyrie,
135;00:12:51,732;00:12:53,600;you need to go through
135;00:12:51,732;00:12:53,600;the Bloody Gate.
136;00:12:53,651;00:12:57,103;It doesn't matter how
136;00:12:53,651;00:12:57,103;large your army is,
137;00:12:57,154;00:12:59,823;if you attack this gate,
137;00:12:57,154;00:12:59,823;you do it on this road,
138;00:12:59,857;00:13:01,858;three men abreast
139;00:13:01,892;00:13:04,444;and get slaughtered like goats.
140;00:13:04,495;00:13:07,447;The first Lords of the
140;00:13:04,495;00:13:07,447;Vale didn't have much,
141;00:13:07,498;00:13:09,065;but they had these mountains
142;00:13:09,083;00:13:11,034;and they knew how to use them.
143;00:13:11,068;00:13:13,787;And the fortress they built
143;00:13:11,068;00:13:13,787;here has never been overcome.
144;00:13:13,838;00:13:16,589;Not once in 1,000 years.
145;00:13:16,624;00:13:19,376;Know your strengths,
145;00:13:16,624;00:13:19,376;use them wisely,
146;00:13:19,410;00:13:22,796;and one man can be worth 10,000.
147;00:13:27,952;00:13:29,753;Who would
147;00:13:27,952;00:13:29,753;pass the Bloody Gate?
148;00:13:29,787;00:13:33,056;Lord Petyr Baelish
148;00:13:29,787;00:13:33,056;and his niece Alayne.
149;00:13:37,361;00:13:38,778;Stand to.
150;00:13:38,813;00:13:41,448;Stand to!
150;00:13:38,813;00:13:41,448;Stand to!
151;00:13:42,900;00:13:45,061;Welcome back, Lord Baelish.
152;00:14:14,932;00:14:16,733;Uncle Petyr!
153;00:14:18,986;00:14:21,237;My lord.
154;00:14:26,810;00:14:28,945;Oh.
155;00:14:28,979;00:14:33,199;I have brought you a gift.
156;00:14:37,621;00:14:39,372;Lord Baelish.
157;00:14:39,423;00:14:42,125;My lady.
157;00:14:39,423;00:14:42,125;Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.
158;00:14:42,176;00:14:44,794;A beautiful gift
158;00:14:42,176;00:14:44,794;for a beautiful boy.
159;00:14:44,828;00:14:47,514;It's a pleasure to make
159;00:14:44,828;00:14:47,514;your acquaintance, Lady Arryn.
160;00:14:47,548;00:14:49,048;My name is Al...
161;00:14:49,099;00:14:51,551;Oh, do take down
161;00:14:49,099;00:14:51,551;that hood, child.
162;00:14:51,602;00:14:53,669;Don't you think know
162;00:14:51,602;00:14:53,669;who you are?
163;00:14:53,687;00:14:56,523;You think I'd let my intended
164;00:14:56,557;00:14:58,525;leave the Eyrie
164;00:14:56,557;00:14:58,525;on urgent business
165;00:14:58,559;00:15:01,194;without knowing
165;00:14:58,559;00:15:01,194;what that business was?
166;00:15:02,646;00:15:06,533;I let him go so he could
166;00:15:02,646;00:15:06,533;bring you here to me.
167;00:15:10,120;00:15:12,572;My flesh and blood.
168;00:15:14,458;00:15:16,526;It's wonderful
168;00:15:14,458;00:15:16,526;to meet you, Aunt Lysa.
169;00:15:16,544;00:15:18,828;You mustn't call me that
169;00:15:16,544;00:15:18,828;in front of anyone else.
170;00:15:18,862;00:15:19,996;Of course. I understand.
171;00:15:20,030;00:15:21,631;No one can know you're here.
172;00:15:21,665;00:15:23,750;It would put us in a very
172;00:15:21,665;00:15:23,750;precarious position.
173;00:15:23,801;00:15:25,385;I would never say a thing.
174;00:15:25,419;00:15:27,971;The Lannisters
174;00:15:25,419;00:15:27,971;want to destroy us.
175;00:15:28,005;00:15:29,923;They've been trying for years.
176;00:15:29,974;00:15:32,008;Now they know
176;00:15:29,974;00:15:32,008;what it feels like.
177;00:15:32,042;00:15:35,845;Mummy said they killed your mother and
177;00:15:32,042;00:15:35,845;they chopped off your brother's head.
178;00:15:37,648;00:15:41,067;They did, and my father's.
179;00:15:41,101;00:15:44,061;They killed my father,
179;00:15:41,101;00:15:44,061;too, with poison.
180;00:15:45,155;00:15:47,824;I wanted to make the little
180;00:15:45,155;00:15:47,824;Lannister baby man fly,
181;00:15:47,858;00:15:50,059;but Mother said I couldn't.
182;00:15:50,077;00:15:51,894;Make him fly?
183;00:15:51,912;00:15:53,947;Through the Moon Door.
184;00:15:58,285;00:16:00,770;And on top of
184;00:15:58,285;00:16:00,770;everything else,
185;00:16:00,804;00:16:03,339;they made you marry
185;00:16:00,804;00:16:03,339;that filthy troll.
186;00:16:03,374;00:16:05,542;They did. They made us both.
187;00:16:05,593;00:16:06,960;Lord Tyrion didn't want to.
188;00:16:07,011;00:16:08,912;I don't believe
188;00:16:07,011;00:16:08,912;that for a moment.
189;00:16:08,946;00:16:10,964;Did he force himself on you?
190;00:16:11,015;00:16:12,715;No.
191;00:16:12,749;00:16:14,267;We never...
191;00:16:12,749;00:16:14,267;-  Good.
192;00:16:14,301;00:16:17,687;Robin, this is
192;00:16:14,301;00:16:17,687;your cousin Sansa.
193;00:16:17,721;00:16:19,889;But you're not to call
193;00:16:17,721;00:16:19,889;her Sansa in front of anyone
194;00:16:19,940;00:16:21,757;but Uncle Petyr and myself.
194;00:16:19,940;00:16:21,757;Do you understand?
195;00:16:21,775;00:16:24,193;Sansa, this is my son Robin.
196;00:16:25,429;00:16:27,363;It's a pleasure
196;00:16:25,429;00:16:27,363;to meet you, Robin.
197;00:16:27,398;00:16:29,732;Robin, show Sansa
197;00:16:27,398;00:16:29,732;to her chamber.
198;00:16:29,783;00:16:31,951;Take the back stairs.
199;00:16:34,238;00:16:36,906;Go. We'll speak soon.
200;00:16:45,833;00:16:47,783;What took you so long?
201;00:16:47,801;00:16:50,786;Arranging for the ascension
201;00:16:47,801;00:16:50,786;of King Tommen I,
202;00:16:50,804;00:16:54,424;extricating Sansa,
202;00:16:50,804;00:16:54,424;getting her here alive.
203;00:16:54,458;00:16:58,261;She's here. We've spent more than
203;00:16:54,458;00:16:58,261;enough time on her for one evening.
204;00:17:00,514;00:17:02,482;Let's get married tonight.
205;00:17:02,566;00:17:04,817;Ought we not...
206;00:17:04,852;00:17:07,937;inform the Lords of the
206;00:17:04,852;00:17:07,937;Vale about the ceremony?
207;00:17:07,971;00:17:09,856;There's only one
207;00:17:07,971;00:17:09,856;Lord of the Vale.
208;00:17:09,907;00:17:11,741;The others can all hang.
209;00:17:11,775;00:17:14,193;Lurking and simpering
209;00:17:11,775;00:17:14,193;on the stairs like buzzards
210;00:17:14,244;00:17:17,664;the moment my husband died,
210;00:17:14,244;00:17:17,664;trying to get their claws in me.
211;00:17:17,698;00:17:19,198;I do think that
211;00:17:17,698;00:17:19,198;we could wait until...
212;00:17:19,249;00:17:21,584;I'm done waiting, Petyr.
213;00:17:21,619;00:17:23,986;We had our wedding night
213;00:17:21,619;00:17:23,986;many years ago.
214;00:17:24,004;00:17:26,089;Or don't you remember?
215;00:17:26,123;00:17:29,092;Like it was yesterday.
216;00:17:29,126;00:17:33,296;What wife would do for you
216;00:17:29,126;00:17:33,296;the things I've done for you?
217;00:17:33,330;00:17:36,182;What wife would trust you
217;00:17:33,330;00:17:36,182;the way I've trusted you?
218;00:17:36,216;00:17:39,052;When you gave me those drops
219;00:17:39,103;00:17:41,521;and told me to pour
219;00:17:39,103;00:17:41,521;them into Jon's wine,
220;00:17:41,555;00:17:43,022;my husband's wine...
221;00:17:43,057;00:17:46,225;when you told me
221;00:17:43,057;00:17:46,225;to write a letter to Cat
222;00:17:46,276;00:17:48,611;telling her it was
222;00:17:46,276;00:17:48,611;the Lannisters...
223;00:18:00,908;00:18:02,825;The deed is done.
224;00:18:02,859;00:18:05,528;Faded into nothing.
225;00:18:05,546;00:18:08,498;Only speaking of it
225;00:18:05,546;00:18:08,498;can make it real.
226;00:18:11,885;00:18:13,553;Tonight it is, then.
227;00:18:17,725;00:18:20,009;Let me bathe and dress
227;00:18:17,725;00:18:20,009;for the occasion.
228;00:18:20,043;00:18:23,479;Once I'm presentable, I'll call
228;00:18:20,043;00:18:23,479;on the septon immediately.
229;00:18:30,320;00:18:32,405;I'm warning you.
230;00:18:32,439;00:18:36,526;I'm going to scream when my
230;00:18:32,439;00:18:36,526;husband makes love to me.
231;00:18:36,560;00:18:39,746;I'm going to scream so loud,
232;00:18:39,780;00:18:42,865;they'll hear me clear
232;00:18:39,780;00:18:42,865;across the Narrow Sea.
233;00:19:07,825;00:19:11,160;When will the wedding
233;00:19:07,825;00:19:11,160;take place in your mind?
234;00:19:11,195;00:19:12,895;As soon as decency permits.
235;00:19:12,930;00:19:16,933;After we've allowed Tommen the
235;00:19:12,930;00:19:16,933;appropriate time to mourn his brother
236;00:19:16,967;00:19:19,702;and Margaery
236;00:19:16,967;00:19:19,702;to mourn her husband.
237;00:19:19,737;00:19:22,205;A fortnight?
237;00:19:19,737;00:19:22,205;That seems reasonable.
238;00:19:22,239;00:19:25,241;No jugglers,
238;00:19:22,239;00:19:25,241;no jousting dwarves,
239;00:19:25,275;00:19:28,578;no 77-course meals.
240;00:19:30,714;00:19:33,015;And your wedding to Loras?
241;00:19:34,318;00:19:35,635;Shortly after Tommen's.
242;00:19:35,669;00:19:38,054;Shortly?
242;00:19:35,669;00:19:38,054;A fortnight.
243;00:19:39,139;00:19:41,340;I know you don't like them.
244;00:19:41,391;00:19:43,793;I didn't like your husband.
245;00:19:43,827;00:19:46,028;Used to pat me
245;00:19:43,827;00:19:46,028;on the back a lot.
246;00:19:46,063;00:19:47,663;I didn't trust him.
247;00:19:47,698;00:19:49,699;We had that in common.
248;00:19:49,733;00:19:53,336;You don't need to make formal
248;00:19:49,733;00:19:53,336;alliances with people you trust.
249;00:19:53,370;00:19:55,988;Then whom can we trust?
250;00:19:57,307;00:19:59,776;Ourselves alone.
251;00:20:02,162;00:20:04,313;The Tyrells
252;00:20:04,331;00:20:06,949;are our only true rivals
253;00:20:07,000;00:20:08,701;in terms of resources
254;00:20:08,752;00:20:11,954;and we need them on our side.
255;00:20:12,005;00:20:14,423;Robert wasn't particularly rich.
256;00:20:14,458;00:20:17,677;Robert had me funding him.
257;00:20:17,711;00:20:20,963;Wars swallow gold
257;00:20:17,711;00:20:20,963;like a pit in the earth.
258;00:20:20,997;00:20:24,357;I suppose that explains why we
258;00:20:20,997;00:20:24,357;did so well in the last one.
259;00:20:24,384;00:20:28,437;Do you know how much gold was mined
259;00:20:24,384;00:20:28,437;in the Westerlands this past year?
260;00:20:28,472;00:20:29,605;Haven't a clue.
261;00:20:29,640;00:20:31,340;Go on, your best guess.
262;00:20:31,358;00:20:34,143;Pounds, tons, ounces?
263;00:20:34,177;00:20:36,646;Doesn't matter.
263;00:20:34,177;00:20:36,646;The answer is the same.
264;00:20:37,848;00:20:39,315;That can't be.
265;00:20:39,366;00:20:42,401;Our last working mine
265;00:20:39,366;00:20:42,401;ran dry three years ago.
266;00:20:43,687;00:20:45,538;Then how do we pay for anything?
267;00:20:45,572;00:20:47,990;The crown owes
267;00:20:45,572;00:20:47,990;the Iron Bank of Braavos
268;00:20:48,024;00:20:49,659;a tremendous amount of money.
269;00:20:49,693;00:20:51,294;How much?
270;00:20:52,713;00:20:54,463;A tremendous amount.
271;00:20:56,216;00:20:58,668;There must be someone
271;00:20:56,216;00:20:58,668;at the Iron Bank
272;00:20:58,702;00:21:01,137;you can speak to,
272;00:20:58,702;00:21:01,137;come to some arrangement.
273;00:21:01,171;00:21:02,922;The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank.
274;00:21:02,973;00:21:04,557;There is no someone.
275;00:21:04,591;00:21:07,176;Someone does work there.
275;00:21:04,591;00:21:07,176;It is comprised of people.
276;00:21:07,227;00:21:09,312;And a temple
276;00:21:07,227;00:21:09,312;is comprised of stones.
277;00:21:09,346;00:21:12,265;One stone crumbles
277;00:21:09,346;00:21:12,265;and another takes its place.
278;00:21:12,316;00:21:16,936;And the temple holds its form
278;00:21:12,316;00:21:16,936;for 1,000 years or more.
279;00:21:16,987;00:21:20,573;That's what the Iron
279;00:21:16,987;00:21:20,573;Bank is... a temple.
280;00:21:20,607;00:21:23,826;We all live in its shadow
280;00:21:20,607;00:21:23,826;and almost none of us know it.
281;00:21:25,362;00:21:27,396;You can't run from them.
281;00:21:25,362;00:21:27,396;You can't cheat them.
282;00:21:27,414;00:21:30,132;You can't sway them
282;00:21:27,414;00:21:30,132;with excuses.
283;00:21:30,167;00:21:33,803;If you owe them money and you
283;00:21:30,167;00:21:33,803;don't want to crumble yourself,
284;00:21:33,837;00:21:36,289;you pay it back.
285;00:21:36,340;00:21:38,124;Vesting the Tyrells in the crown
286;00:21:38,175;00:21:39,959;will help a great deal
286;00:21:38,175;00:21:39,959;in this respect.
287;00:21:40,010;00:21:43,813;It's for the good of the
287;00:21:40,010;00:21:43,813;family, I understand that.
288;00:21:47,251;00:21:49,468;I'm not sure my brothers do.
289;00:21:53,256;00:21:56,809;I know you're building
289;00:21:53,256;00:21:56,809;a strong case against Tyrion.
290;00:21:56,860;00:22:00,029;And as a mother,
290;00:21:56,860;00:22:00,029;that is your right.
291;00:22:00,063;00:22:04,567;But as a judge, I cannot
291;00:22:00,063;00:22:04,567;discuss the trial with you.
292;00:22:04,601;00:22:06,736;I respect that.
293;00:22:09,239;00:22:11,407;We don't need to discuss it.
294;00:22:14,044;00:22:17,380;The Lannister legacy is the
294;00:22:14,044;00:22:17,380;only thing that matters.
295;00:22:17,414;00:22:20,583;You've started wars
295;00:22:17,414;00:22:20,583;to protect this family.
296;00:22:20,617;00:22:22,952;Turned your back on Jaime
297;00:22:22,970;00:22:26,022;for refusing to
297;00:22:22,970;00:22:26,022;contribute to its future.
298;00:22:26,056;00:22:29,292;What does Tyrion deserve
299;00:22:29,326;00:22:31,877;for lighting
299;00:22:29,326;00:22:31,877;that future on fire?
300;00:22:41,438;00:22:43,823;Joffrey.
301;00:22:43,857;00:22:46,025;Cersei.
302;00:22:46,109;00:22:48,027;Walder Frey.
303;00:22:48,078;00:22:50,313;Meryn Trant.
304;00:22:50,347;00:22:53,149;Tywin Lannister.
305;00:22:53,183;00:22:55,284;The Red Woman.
306;00:22:55,318;00:22:57,670;Beric Dondarrion.
307;00:22:57,704;00:23:00,790;Thoros of Myr.
308;00:23:00,824;00:23:02,758;Ilyn Payne.
309;00:23:02,793;00:23:04,627;The Mountain.
310;00:23:04,661;00:23:06,595;Would you shut up?
311;00:23:06,630;00:23:10,016;I can't sleep
311;00:23:06,630;00:23:10,016;until I say the names.
312;00:23:10,050;00:23:13,686;The names of every
312;00:23:10,050;00:23:13,686;fucking person in Westeros?
313;00:23:14,771;00:23:16,555;Only the ones I'm going to kill.
314;00:23:18,442;00:23:21,010;Hate's as good a thing
314;00:23:18,442;00:23:21,010;as any to keep a person going.
315;00:23:21,028;00:23:23,562;Better than most.
316;00:23:25,015;00:23:27,116;We come across my brother,
317;00:23:27,150;00:23:30,619;maybe we can both cross
317;00:23:27,150;00:23:30,619;a name off our list.
318;00:23:33,707;00:23:36,409;If he were here right now,
318;00:23:33,707;00:23:36,409;what would you do?
319;00:23:44,367;00:23:46,335;I'd tell him to shut the fuck up
320;00:23:46,369;00:23:48,504;so I can get some sleep.
321;00:23:51,975;00:23:54,477;Go on, get it over with,
322;00:23:54,511;00:23:57,096;your list of doomed men.
323;00:23:58,982;00:24:01,233;I'm almost done.
324;00:24:01,268;00:24:03,402;Only one name left.
325;00:24:04,354;00:24:06,155;Go on.
326;00:24:14,231;00:24:16,032;The Hound.
327;00:24:23,090;00:24:24,340;Thank you.
328;00:24:24,374;00:24:26,425;Your mother always had a
328;00:24:24,374;00:24:26,425;sweet tooth, you know?
329;00:24:26,460;00:24:28,010;Really?
329;00:24:26,460;00:24:28,010;Oh, yes.
330;00:24:28,045;00:24:31,246;At suppertime, she would go
330;00:24:28,045;00:24:31,246;straight for honey cakes,
331;00:24:31,264;00:24:32,944;candied almonds, custard.
332;00:24:32,966;00:24:34,633;Anything sweet.
333;00:24:34,684;00:24:36,218;Eventually, your grandfather
334;00:24:36,252;00:24:38,804;had to assign a septa
334;00:24:36,252;00:24:38,804;to watch her at meals.
335;00:24:38,855;00:24:41,423;Cat was the firstborn
335;00:24:38,855;00:24:41,423;daughter after all.
336;00:24:41,441;00:24:43,392;It was important
336;00:24:41,441;00:24:43,392;that she remain desirable
337;00:24:43,443;00:24:45,094;so Father could arrange
337;00:24:43,443;00:24:45,094;a good match for her
338;00:24:45,112;00:24:47,780;and she was starting to get fat.
339;00:24:47,814;00:24:51,233;My mother fat?
340;00:24:53,203;00:24:55,454;She never let me have my pudding
341;00:24:55,489;00:24:57,272;until I'd finished
341;00:24:55,489;00:24:57,272;all my proper food.
342;00:24:57,290;00:25:00,659;This is before she married your
342;00:24:57,290;00:25:00,659;father and moved to the North.
343;00:25:00,710;00:25:04,296;By the time you were born, your
343;00:25:00,710;00:25:04,296;father's austerity had become hers.
344;00:25:04,331;00:25:07,383;Marriage changes people.
345;00:25:10,053;00:25:12,121;I didn't mean for you to stop.
346;00:25:12,139;00:25:13,923;Go on, enjoy them.
347;00:25:17,978;00:25:20,096;How do you like them?
348;00:25:20,147;00:25:22,148;They're delicious.
349;00:25:24,684;00:25:27,520;Where did you get the lemons?
349;00:25:24,684;00:25:27,520;You can't grow them up here.
350;00:25:27,571;00:25:29,188;Oh, gods, no.
351;00:25:29,239;00:25:32,358;Petyr had three crates brought
351;00:25:29,239;00:25:32,358;all the way from King's Landing.
352;00:25:32,409;00:25:34,309;He knew you liked lemon cakes.
353;00:25:34,327;00:25:36,112;He's so kind.
354;00:25:36,146;00:25:38,147;He really cares for you.
355;00:25:38,165;00:25:41,083;Think where you'd
355;00:25:38,165;00:25:41,083;be without him.
356;00:25:41,118;00:25:43,452;In their clutches
356;00:25:41,118;00:25:43,452;and tried for murder.
357;00:25:44,654;00:25:47,506;Yes. I'm very lucky.
358;00:25:47,541;00:25:49,158;He feels responsible for you.
359;00:25:49,176;00:25:50,759;Oh, I know he does.
359;00:25:49,176;00:25:50,759;I'm so grateful.
360;00:25:50,794;00:25:52,661;Why?
361;00:25:52,679;00:25:55,464;Why does he feel
361;00:25:52,679;00:25:55,464;responsible for you?
362;00:25:56,516;00:25:58,384;Well, I'm half Tully.
363;00:25:58,435;00:26:01,003;He loved your family so much.
363;00:25:58,435;00:26:01,003;Loved your mother.
364;00:26:01,021;00:26:02,972;No.
364;00:26:01,021;00:26:02,972;That's what you wanted to say.
365;00:26:03,023;00:26:04,440;He loves you, Aunt Lysa.
365;00:26:03,023;00:26:04,440;He's married to you.
366;00:26:04,474;00:26:06,559;Your mother never
366;00:26:04,474;00:26:06,559;loved him. Never.
367;00:26:06,610;00:26:09,528;Cat always went straight
367;00:26:06,610;00:26:09,528;for the sweetest thing.
368;00:26:09,563;00:26:12,615;The most obvious thing.
368;00:26:09,563;00:26:12,615;Your Uncle Brandon.
369;00:26:12,649;00:26:15,618;Your handsome, arrogant,
369;00:26:12,649;00:26:15,618;cruel Uncle Brandon.
370;00:26:15,652;00:26:18,187;He almost killed Petyr
370;00:26:15,652;00:26:18,187;in a duel.
371;00:26:18,205;00:26:20,406;And your mother
371;00:26:18,205;00:26:20,406;loved him anyway.
372;00:26:20,457;00:26:24,076;And now Petyr is risking
372;00:26:20,457;00:26:24,076;his life to save you,
373;00:26:24,127;00:26:26,829;the daughter of a woman
373;00:26:24,127;00:26:26,829;who didn't love him
374;00:26:26,863;00:26:29,882;no more than those
374;00:26:26,863;00:26:29,882;whores in his brothels.
375;00:26:29,916;00:26:32,868;Has he told you about them?
375;00:26:29,916;00:26:32,868;No.
376;00:26:32,886;00:26:35,704;He hasn't told you about the vile
376;00:26:32,886;00:26:35,704;things they do with their bodies?
377;00:26:35,722;00:26:37,890;The vile things they let
377;00:26:35,722;00:26:37,890;him do with their bodies?
378;00:26:37,924;00:26:40,142;No, never.
378;00:26:37,924;00:26:40,142;Are you pregnant?
379;00:26:41,478;00:26:44,563;What? No, I told you.
379;00:26:41,478;00:26:44,563;Lord Tyrion and I never...
380;00:26:44,598;00:26:46,482;I wasn't asking about Tyrion.
381;00:26:46,516;00:26:48,567;What have you let Petyr
381;00:26:46,516;00:26:48,567;do with your body?
382;00:26:48,602;00:26:51,153;Aunt Lysa, no, I...
382;00:26:48,602;00:26:51,153;Your young, pretty body.
383;00:26:51,188;00:26:53,856;Nothing. I'm a virgin.
383;00:26:51,188;00:26:53,856;Don't lie to me.
384;00:26:53,890;00:26:57,193;You're hurting me.
385;00:26:57,227;00:26:58,727;I'll know if you lie.
386;00:26:58,745;00:27:01,530;I'm a virgin, I swear it.
387;00:27:01,581;00:27:03,365;He loves you, Aunt Lysa.
388;00:27:03,399;00:27:05,400;All he says is that I'm stupid.
389;00:27:05,418;00:27:07,402;I'm a stupid little girl
389;00:27:05,418;00:27:07,402;with stupid dreams
390;00:27:07,420;00:27:09,288;who never learns
390;00:27:07,420;00:27:09,288;and I'm a terrible liar,
391;00:27:09,339;00:27:10,660;so I should always
391;00:27:09,339;00:27:10,660;tell the truth.
392;00:27:10,674;00:27:12,925;And I swear to you that
392;00:27:10,674;00:27:12,925;he has never touched me.
393;00:27:12,959;00:27:15,427;Not once, not ever.
393;00:27:12,959;00:27:15,427;Shh. Shh. Shh.
394;00:27:17,080;00:27:19,081;It's all right.
395;00:27:19,099;00:27:21,217;It will all be all right.
396;00:27:21,268;00:27:22,551;You'll be a widow soon.
397;00:27:22,585;00:27:24,970;They'll execute that dwarf
397;00:27:22,585;00:27:24,970;for murdering the king
398;00:27:25,021;00:27:27,223;and you'll be free
398;00:27:25,021;00:27:27,223;to marry Robin.
399;00:27:27,274;00:27:29,391;You'll be the Lady of the Vale.
400;00:27:29,425;00:27:31,810;Hmm.
401;00:27:53,800;00:27:56,118;Didn't they teach you
401;00:27:53,800;00:27:56,118;how to ride a horse?
402;00:27:56,136;00:27:59,638;Yes, my lady, when I was young.
403;00:27:59,673;00:28:01,674;There wasn't much call for
403;00:27:59,673;00:28:01,674;it with Lord Tyrion, though.
404;00:28:01,725;00:28:04,310;He preferred litters.
405;00:28:04,344;00:28:07,062;Perhaps you should
405;00:28:04,344;00:28:07,062;have stayed with him.
406;00:28:13,069;00:28:15,354;It's not going to be
406;00:28:13,069;00:28:15,354;a pleasant journey for you.
407;00:28:15,405;00:28:18,824;It could take weeks to get to the
407;00:28:15,405;00:28:18,824;Wall, depending on the weather.
408;00:28:18,858;00:28:20,526;That's a long way off.
409;00:28:20,577;00:28:23,529;Well, Lady Sansa's
409;00:28:20,577;00:28:23,529;brother's at Castle Black.
410;00:28:23,580;00:28:26,148;If I were her,
410;00:28:23,580;00:28:26,148;that's where I'd go.
411;00:28:26,166;00:28:28,701;Feel free to stop at any point.
412;00:28:28,752;00:28:31,653;Never, my lady.
412;00:28:28,752;00:28:31,653;I'm your squire.
413;00:28:31,671;00:28:34,206;I've made it this far in
413;00:28:31,671;00:28:34,206;the world without a squire.
414;00:28:34,257;00:28:35,674;I don't see why I need one now.
415;00:28:35,709;00:28:37,459;All knights have
415;00:28:35,709;00:28:37,459;squires, my lady.
416;00:28:37,493;00:28:38,827;I'm not a knight.
417;00:28:38,845;00:28:41,997;And I'm not a slaver, either.
417;00:28:38,845;00:28:41,997;I don't own you.
418;00:28:42,048;00:28:44,133;I swore an oath, my lady.
419;00:28:44,167;00:28:46,685;I am releasing you
419;00:28:44,167;00:28:46,685;from that oath.
420;00:28:49,723;00:28:51,940;That means you could leave.
421;00:28:51,975;00:28:53,726;I know.
422;00:28:53,777;00:28:56,278;What do you think
422;00:28:53,777;00:28:56,278;will happen if you leave?
423;00:28:57,480;00:29:00,149;They'll say I wasn't
423;00:28:57,480;00:29:00,149;a very good squire.
424;00:29:54,737;00:29:58,006;The hell you doing?
424;00:29:54,737;00:29:58,006;Practicing.
425;00:29:58,041;00:30:01,260;What, ways to die?
425;00:29:58,041;00:30:01,260;No one's going to kill me.
426;00:30:01,294;00:30:03,245;They will if you nance
426;00:30:01,294;00:30:03,245;around like that.
427;00:30:03,263;00:30:05,747;That's no way to fight.
428;00:30:05,765;00:30:08,717;It's not fighting.
428;00:30:05,765;00:30:08,717;It's water dancing.
429;00:30:08,768;00:30:10,853;Dancing?
430;00:30:10,887;00:30:13,168;Maybe you ought
430;00:30:10,887;00:30:13,168;to put on a dress.
431;00:30:14,891;00:30:16,931;Who taught you that shite?
432;00:30:16,943;00:30:19,528;The greatest swordsman
432;00:30:16,943;00:30:19,528;who ever lived.
433;00:30:21,931;00:30:25,434;Syrio Forel, the First Sword
433;00:30:21,931;00:30:25,434;to the Sealord of Braavos.
434;00:30:25,452;00:30:26,869;Braavos.
435;00:30:26,903;00:30:28,737;Greasy-haired little
435;00:30:26,903;00:30:28,737;bastard, I bet.
436;00:30:28,771;00:30:30,122;They all are.
437;00:30:30,156;00:30:31,740;What do you know about anything?
438;00:30:31,774;00:30:33,942;I bet his hair is greasier
438;00:30:31,774;00:30:33,942;than Joffrey's cunt.
439;00:30:33,960;00:30:35,961;It was not.
439;00:30:33,960;00:30:35,961;Was? He dead?
440;00:30:35,995;00:30:36,945;Yes.
440;00:30:35,995;00:30:36,945;How?
441;00:30:36,963;00:30:38,831;He was killed.
441;00:30:36,963;00:30:38,831;Who by?
442;00:30:38,882;00:30:40,666;Meryn Trant.
442;00:30:38,882;00:30:40,666;That's why Ser Meryn...
443;00:30:40,717;00:30:42,451;Meryn Trant?
444;00:30:42,469;00:30:45,637;The greatest swordsman who ever lived
444;00:30:42,469;00:30:45,637;killed by Meryn fucking Trant?
445;00:30:45,672;00:30:47,639;He was outnumbered.
445;00:30:45,672;00:30:47,639;Any boy whore with a sword
446;00:30:47,674;00:30:49,591;could beat three Meryn Trants.
447;00:30:49,642;00:30:52,060;Syrio didn't have a sword.
447;00:30:49,642;00:30:52,060;Or armor. Just a stick.
448;00:30:52,095;00:30:54,263;The greatest swordsman who ever
448;00:30:52,095;00:30:54,263;lived didn't have a sword?
449;00:30:56,799;00:30:58,600;All right. You have a sword.
450;00:30:58,634;00:31:00,068;Let's see what he taught you.
451;00:31:00,103;00:31:02,938;Go on, do it for
451;00:31:00,103;00:31:02,938;your Braavosi friend.
452;00:31:04,307;00:31:06,627;Dead like all the rest
452;00:31:04,307;00:31:06,627;of your friends.
453;00:31:17,153;00:31:20,956;Your friend's dead
453;00:31:17,153;00:31:20,956;and Meryn Trant's not
454;00:31:20,990;00:31:22,708;'cause Trant had armor
455;00:31:22,759;00:31:25,093;and a big fucking sword.
456;00:31:55,358;00:31:57,242;Your Grace.
457;00:31:57,293;00:31:59,962;Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?
458;00:31:59,996;00:32:02,748;A poem, actually.
459;00:32:04,033;00:32:06,034;May I show you the gardens?
460;00:32:06,052;00:32:09,137;I couldn't very well
460;00:32:06,052;00:32:09,137;refuse a royal escort.
461;00:32:09,172;00:32:11,340;No, you couldn't.
462;00:32:13,543;00:32:15,844;I didn't realize
462;00:32:13,543;00:32:15,844;you were a poet.
463;00:32:15,878;00:32:18,514;Not a very good one.
464;00:32:18,548;00:32:20,599;For your paramour?
465;00:32:20,650;00:32:22,985;For one of my daughters.
466;00:32:23,019;00:32:25,437;You have several, don't you?
467;00:32:25,488;00:32:26,822;Eight.
468;00:32:26,856;00:32:28,557;Eight?
469;00:32:28,575;00:32:30,826;Eight daughters?
470;00:32:30,860;00:32:32,694;The fifth is difficult.
471;00:32:32,745;00:32:35,364;I named her after
471;00:32:32,745;00:32:35,364;my sister Elia.
472;00:32:35,398;00:32:37,032;Beautiful name.
473;00:32:37,066;00:32:38,951;Yes.
474;00:32:39,002;00:32:42,070;But I can't say it
474;00:32:39,002;00:32:42,070;without turning sad.
475;00:32:42,088;00:32:45,007;And after I turn sad,
476;00:32:45,041;00:32:47,209;I grow angry.
477;00:32:47,243;00:32:49,962;Perhaps that's why
477;00:32:47,243;00:32:49,962;she's difficult.
478;00:32:50,013;00:32:53,098;The gods love their
478;00:32:50,013;00:32:53,098;stupid jokes, don't they?
479;00:32:53,132;00:32:55,417;Which joke is that?
480;00:32:55,435;00:32:57,803;You're a prince of Dorne.
481;00:32:57,854;00:33:00,055;A legendary fighter.
482;00:33:00,106;00:33:02,274;A brilliant man feared
482;00:33:00,106;00:33:02,274;throughout Westeros.
483;00:33:02,308;00:33:05,260;But you could not
483;00:33:02,308;00:33:05,260;save your sister.
484;00:33:05,278;00:33:08,697;I'm a Lannister.
484;00:33:05,278;00:33:08,697;Queen for 19 years.
485;00:33:08,731;00:33:10,866;Daughter of the most
485;00:33:08,731;00:33:10,866;powerful man alive.
486;00:33:10,900;00:33:13,569;But I could not save my son.
487;00:33:13,603;00:33:16,038;What good is power
488;00:33:16,072;00:33:19,074;if you cannot protect
488;00:33:16,072;00:33:19,074;the ones you love?
489;00:33:19,108;00:33:20,909;We can avenge them.
490;00:33:20,943;00:33:23,412;Yes, we can avenge them.
491;00:33:25,131;00:33:27,633;You really believe
491;00:33:25,131;00:33:27,633;Tyrion murdered your son?
492;00:33:28,885;00:33:30,886;I know he did.
493;00:33:32,622;00:33:35,374;We will have a trial and
493;00:33:32,622;00:33:35,374;we will learn the truth.
494;00:33:35,408;00:33:37,759;We'll have a trial, anyway.
495;00:33:41,964;00:33:45,434;I haven't seen my
495;00:33:41,964;00:33:45,434;daughter in over a year.
496;00:33:45,468;00:33:47,436;The last time I saw her,
497;00:33:47,470;00:33:50,772;she was swimming with two of
497;00:33:47,470;00:33:50,772;my girls in the Water Gardens.
498;00:33:50,806;00:33:53,609;Laughing in the sun.
499;00:33:55,645;00:33:57,613;I want to believe that.
500;00:33:57,647;00:34:00,482;I want to believe she's happy.
501;00:34:00,500;00:34:03,085;You have my word.
502;00:34:03,119;00:34:05,954;We don't hurt
502;00:34:03,119;00:34:05,954;little girls in Dorne.
503;00:34:07,373;00:34:10,425;Everywhere in the world,
503;00:34:07,373;00:34:10,425;they hurt little girls.
504;00:34:19,802;00:34:21,682;Would you bring her
504;00:34:19,802;00:34:21,682;a gift for me?
505;00:34:23,506;00:34:25,273;I wasn't there for her name day.
506;00:34:25,308;00:34:27,643;I don't know when
506;00:34:25,308;00:34:27,643;I'll see her again.
507;00:34:27,677;00:34:30,112;Anything at all.
508;00:34:31,364;00:34:33,398;The best shipwrights
508;00:34:31,364;00:34:33,398;in King's Landing
509;00:34:33,449;00:34:35,567;have been working
509;00:34:33,449;00:34:35,567;on it for months.
510;00:34:35,618;00:34:39,037;Myrcella loves the open water.
511;00:34:39,072;00:34:43,208;I will have it sailed
511;00:34:39,072;00:34:43,208;down to Sunspear for her.
512;00:34:44,694;00:34:46,595;Please tell her...
513;00:34:48,998;00:34:51,333;her mother misses her very much.
514;00:35:00,426;00:35:02,811;Oh, no, no, no.
515;00:35:02,845;00:35:04,763;No, no, no, no.
516;00:35:05,848;00:35:07,232;Hells.
517;00:35:10,603;00:35:12,404;Gods.
518;00:35:15,408;00:35:17,359;Did you remove the skin?
519;00:35:19,445;00:35:20,996;No, my lady.
520;00:35:21,030;00:35:22,998;Have you ever cooked
520;00:35:21,030;00:35:22,998;a rabbit before?
521;00:35:23,032;00:35:25,400;No, my lady.
522;00:35:25,418;00:35:29,204;Did you ever cook
522;00:35:25,418;00:35:29,204;anything for Lord Tyrion?
523;00:35:29,238;00:35:32,174;No, my lady.
524;00:35:32,208;00:35:33,925;That was the cooks.
525;00:35:51,310;00:35:52,644;What are you doing?
526;00:35:52,695;00:35:54,929;I'm helping you with your armor.
527;00:35:54,947;00:35:58,387;I've been removing my own armor for
527;00:35:54,947;00:35:58,387;quite some time, thank you very much.
528;00:36:16,002;00:36:18,637;What exactly did you do
528;00:36:16,002;00:36:18,637;for Lord Tyrion?
529;00:36:18,671;00:36:22,224;I brought him his meals and cleared
529;00:36:18,671;00:36:22,224;his table when he was finished.
530;00:36:22,258;00:36:24,559;I kept his clothing
530;00:36:22,258;00:36:24,559;and linens clean.
531;00:36:24,594;00:36:27,512;Carried his messages
531;00:36:24,594;00:36:27,512;and returned the replies.
532;00:36:29,315;00:36:31,016;Mostly I poured wine.
533;00:36:31,067;00:36:33,068;Oh.
534;00:36:33,102;00:36:34,982;Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service,
535;00:36:34,987;00:36:38,356;did you ever do anything
535;00:36:34,987;00:36:38,356;remotely related to combat?
536;00:36:42,245;00:36:44,913;I killed a man.
537;00:36:47,450;00:36:50,118;Who?
538;00:36:50,152;00:36:52,170;A Kingsguard.
539;00:36:56,042;00:36:59,461;He tried to kill
539;00:36:56,042;00:36:59,461;Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.
540;00:37:02,849;00:37:05,300;How did you kill a Kingsguard?
541;00:37:07,169;00:37:09,855;I pushed a spear through
541;00:37:07,169;00:37:09,855;the back of his head.
542;00:37:21,701;00:37:23,819;Bloody ridiculous.
543;00:37:27,406;00:37:29,366;Help me with these straps.
544;00:37:48,394;00:37:50,145;Hey.
545;00:37:50,179;00:37:52,180;Hey, get up.
546;00:37:53,115;00:37:56,151;Get up.
547;00:38:01,657;00:38:04,058;That's it
547;00:38:01,657;00:38:04,058;lad, put it inside.
548;00:38:04,076;00:38:06,060;Get the fire going again.
548;00:38:04,076;00:38:06,060;We're all freezing.
549;00:38:06,078;00:38:08,530;Aye. What we need
549;00:38:06,078;00:38:08,530;is a girl there.
550;00:38:08,564;00:38:10,699;I've got to have a piss.
551;00:38:23,679;00:38:25,597;Now keep quiet.
552;00:39:06,422;00:39:08,423;You need water.
553;00:39:08,457;00:39:10,141;It doesn't matter.
554;00:39:10,176;00:39:13,194;Of course it matters.
555;00:39:16,131;00:39:18,466;You mustn't let
555;00:39:16,131;00:39:18,466;anything stop you.
556;00:39:20,486;00:39:23,104;They already have stopped me.
557;00:39:23,139;00:39:25,740;No.
558;00:39:27,810;00:39:30,312;You're not here.
559;00:39:35,985;00:39:38,286;You're far from here.
560;00:39:40,222;00:39:42,457;What does that mean?
561;00:39:48,514;00:39:50,548;At the hill.
562;00:39:50,599;00:39:53,218;A great weirwood tree.
563;00:39:54,770;00:39:58,189;You've seen it, too.
564;00:39:58,224;00:40:02,444;Meera and I, even Hodor,
565;00:40:02,478;00:40:05,113;we're only here to guide you.
566;00:40:08,217;00:40:10,685;He's waiting for you.
567;00:40:12,722;00:40:14,789;We have to find it.
568;00:40:15,925;00:40:18,460;You have to make it.
569;00:40:18,494;00:40:20,095;We will.
570;00:40:21,063;00:40:24,616;This... this isn't the end.
571;00:40:26,335;00:40:27,902;Not for you.
572;00:40:27,937;00:40:30,755;Not yet.
573;00:40:30,806;00:40:33,274;How...

578;00:41:09,962;00:41:12,213;How many?
578;00:41:09,962;00:41:12,213;11 men.
579;00:41:12,247;00:41:14,099;Most of them already drunk.
580;00:41:14,133;00:41:18,019;No guards posted. They don't seem
580;00:41:14,133;00:41:18,019;to have a care in the world.
581;00:41:18,054;00:41:21,056;We'll carve them up
581;00:41:18,054;00:41:21,056;like walnut pie.

585;00:41:27,696;00:41:30,198;Not yet.
586;00:41:32,284;00:41:35,904;There's a hut on the west side of the keep.
586;00:41:32,284;00:41:35,904;We should steer clear of it.
587;00:41:35,938;00:41:37,122;Why?
588;00:41:37,156;00:41:40,274;They've got some hounds
588;00:41:37,156;00:41:40,274;chained up inside.

595;00:42:00,763;00:42:03,264;You take whatever's left.
596;00:42:06,235;00:42:07,852;Get her up.
