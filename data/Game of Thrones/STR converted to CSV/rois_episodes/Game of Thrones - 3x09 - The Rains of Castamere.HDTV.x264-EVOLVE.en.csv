40;00:03:49,569;00:03:52,871;Are you sure about this?

41;00:03:52,906;00:03:55,574;No.

42;00:03:55,608;00:03:57,643;It's dangerous.

43;00:03:59,279;00:04:02,247;If we take Tywin's

43;00:03:59,279;00:04:02,247;castle from him,

44;00:04:02,282;00:04:05,550;the lords of Westeros will

44;00:04:02,282;00:04:05,550;realize he's not invincible.

45;00:04:05,618;00:04:07,052;Take his home,

46;00:04:07,153;00:04:09,187;take his gold, take his power.

47;00:04:09,222;00:04:11,323;Why are you telling me?

48;00:04:15,027;00:04:16,861;You begged me not to send Theon

49;00:04:16,896;00:04:20,799;to negotiate with his father

49;00:04:16,896;00:04:20,799;and I ignored your advice.

50;00:04:23,002;00:04:25,137;Now Winterfell is burnt

50;00:04:23,002;00:04:25,137;to the ground,

51;00:04:25,171;00:04:27,339;the North is overrun

51;00:04:25,171;00:04:27,339;with ironborn,

52;00:04:27,373;00:04:29,441;and Bran and Rickon are gone.

53;00:04:31,944;00:04:33,845;So Casterly Rock...

54;00:04:38,317;00:04:40,151;I'm asking your advice.

55;00:04:46,192;00:04:48,426;We have enough men?

56;00:04:52,131;00:04:54,266;If Walder Frey cooperates.

57;00:04:54,300;00:04:57,269;If Walder Frey cooperates.

58;00:05:02,141;00:05:05,477;If reinforcements arrive

58;00:05:02,141;00:05:05,477;from King's Landing

59;00:05:05,511;00:05:07,879;before we take the castle...

60;00:05:09,248;00:05:13,084;we'll be caught between

60;00:05:09,248;00:05:13,084;Tywin's army and the sea.

61;00:05:17,355;00:05:20,857;We'll lose the war and die

61;00:05:17,355;00:05:20,857;the way Father died.

62;00:05:20,891;00:05:22,892;Or worse.

63;00:05:27,864;00:05:31,734;Show them how it feels

63;00:05:27,864;00:05:31,734;to lose what they love.

64;00:06:02,031;00:06:04,533;My honored guests...

65;00:06:06,102;00:06:08,604;be welcome within my walls

66;00:06:08,638;00:06:10,439;and at my table.

67;00:06:12,476;00:06:15,144;I extend to you my hospitality

68;00:06:15,179;00:06:19,015;and protection

68;00:06:15,179;00:06:19,015;in the light of the Seven.

69;00:06:19,049;00:06:21,685;We thank you for your

69;00:06:19,049;00:06:21,685;hospitality, my lord.

70;00:06:25,656;00:06:28,525;I have come to make

70;00:06:25,656;00:06:28,525;my apologies, my lord,

71;00:06:28,560;00:06:30,427;and to beg your forgiveness.

72;00:06:30,461;00:06:33,830;Don't beg my forgiveness,

72;00:06:30,461;00:06:33,830;Your Grace.

73;00:06:35,233;00:06:38,368;It wasn't me you spurned.

73;00:06:35,233;00:06:38,368;It was my girls.

74;00:06:50,381;00:06:53,550;One of them was supposed

74;00:06:50,381;00:06:53,550;to be queen.

75;00:06:53,584;00:06:55,251;Now none of them are.

76;00:06:56,387;00:06:59,822;This is Arwyen my daughter.

77;00:06:59,857;00:07:04,460;My daughter Walda,

77;00:06:59,857;00:07:04,460;my daughter Derwa,

78;00:07:04,494;00:07:07,062;my daughter Waldra.

79;00:07:11,567;00:07:13,802;My eldest granddaughters

80;00:07:13,837;00:07:17,138;Ginia and Neila.

81;00:07:18,775;00:07:23,212;Serra and Sarra,

81;00:07:18,775;00:07:23,212;granddaughters, twins.

82;00:07:23,246;00:07:24,813;You could have had either.

83;00:07:24,847;00:07:28,117;Could have had both

83;00:07:24,847;00:07:28,117;for all I care.

84;00:07:28,151;00:07:30,585;My granddaughter Marianne.

85;00:07:30,620;00:07:33,488;My granddaughter Freya.

86;00:07:34,924;00:07:37,325;My granddaughter...

87;00:07:37,359;00:07:38,960;Wertha.

88;00:07:41,196;00:07:44,264;Waldra.

89;00:07:44,332;00:07:46,300;Waldina.

90;00:07:46,368;00:07:49,136;I'm Merry.

90;00:07:46,368;00:07:49,136;Fine.

91;00:07:49,170;00:07:52,940;And here's my youngest

91;00:07:49,170;00:07:52,940;daughter Shirei,

92;00:07:52,975;00:07:55,911;though she hasn't bled yet.

93;00:07:55,945;00:07:58,814;Clearly you don't have

93;00:07:55,945;00:07:58,814;the patience for all that.

94;00:08:00,183;00:08:01,817;My ladies.

95;00:08:01,851;00:08:05,354;All men should keep their

95;00:08:01,851;00:08:05,354;word, kings most of all.

96;00:08:06,956;00:08:09,925;I was pledged to marry one

96;00:08:06,956;00:08:09,925;of you and I broke that vow.

97;00:08:09,959;00:08:12,127;The fault is not with you.

98;00:08:12,195;00:08:15,564;Any man would be lucky

98;00:08:12,195;00:08:15,564;to have any one of you.

99;00:08:15,598;00:08:18,500;I did what I did

99;00:08:15,598;00:08:18,500;not to slight you,

100;00:08:18,534;00:08:20,369;but because I loved another.

101;00:08:20,403;00:08:22,304;I know these words

101;00:08:20,403;00:08:22,304;cannot set right

102;00:08:22,338;00:08:24,372;the wrong I have done

102;00:08:22,338;00:08:24,372;to you and your house.

103;00:08:24,407;00:08:27,709;I beg your forgiveness

104;00:08:27,743;00:08:30,845;and pledge to do

104;00:08:27,743;00:08:30,845;all I can to make amends

105;00:08:30,913;00:08:33,715;so the Freys of the Crossing

105;00:08:30,913;00:08:33,715;and the Starks of Winterfell

106;00:08:33,783;00:08:35,683;may once again be friends.

107;00:08:43,025;00:08:44,893;Very good.

108;00:08:47,163;00:08:49,030;There she is.

109;00:08:49,065;00:08:51,199;Come closer.

110;00:08:51,233;00:08:53,200;Let me have a look at you.

111;00:08:59,741;00:09:02,342;Still can't see you.

112;00:09:02,376;00:09:04,511;Old eyes.

113;00:09:19,228;00:09:21,396;Love.

114;00:09:21,430;00:09:25,301;That's what the Starks

114;00:09:21,430;00:09:25,301;of Winterfell call it, eh?

115;00:09:27,404;00:09:29,438;Very honorable.

116;00:09:29,472;00:09:31,740;I call it a pretty face.

117;00:09:31,775;00:09:34,844;Mmm, very pretty.

118;00:09:36,980;00:09:39,048;Prettier than this lot,

118;00:09:36,980;00:09:39,048;that's for sure.

119;00:09:40,918;00:09:42,652;Very shapely as well.

120;00:09:44,288;00:09:47,357;Oh, you try to hide her

120;00:09:44,288;00:09:47,357;under that dress.

121;00:09:47,391;00:09:49,359;If you wanted to hide her,

122;00:09:49,394;00:09:51,762;you shouldn't have brought her

122;00:09:49,394;00:09:51,762;here in the first place.

123;00:09:57,769;00:09:59,437;I can always see

124;00:09:59,471;00:10:02,306;what's going on

124;00:09:59,471;00:10:02,306;beneath a dress.

125;00:10:02,341;00:10:05,243;Been at this a long time.

126;00:10:06,511;00:10:09,146;I bet when you take

126;00:10:06,511;00:10:09,146;that dress off,

127;00:10:09,181;00:10:11,882;everything stays

127;00:10:09,181;00:10:11,882;right where it is.

128;00:10:11,916;00:10:13,716;Doesn't drop an inch.

129;00:10:15,686;00:10:19,254;Your king says he betrayed

129;00:10:15,686;00:10:19,254;me for love.

130;00:10:19,289;00:10:22,024;I say he betrayed me

130;00:10:19,289;00:10:22,024;for firm tits

131;00:10:22,058;00:10:24,660;and a tight fit.

132;00:10:24,694;00:10:27,362;And I can respect that.

133;00:10:29,131;00:10:32,400;When I was your age,

133;00:10:29,131;00:10:32,400;I'd have broken 50 oaths

134;00:10:32,434;00:10:35,869;to get into that

134;00:10:32,434;00:10:35,869;without a second thought.

135;00:10:39,274;00:10:42,676;Well, I've enough room

135;00:10:39,274;00:10:42,676;in the hall for you lot.

136;00:10:42,711;00:10:44,778;We'll set up tents outside

137;00:10:44,813;00:10:47,181;with food and ale

137;00:10:44,813;00:10:47,181;for the rest of your men.

138;00:10:47,215;00:10:49,383;Thank you, my lord.

139;00:10:52,654;00:10:54,222;Well, let's get ready.

140;00:10:54,256;00:10:56,291;The wine will flow red

141;00:10:56,325;00:10:59,795;and the music will play loud

142;00:10:59,829;00:11:04,033;and we'll put

142;00:10:59,829;00:11:04,033;this mess behind us.

143;00:11:13,243;00:11:14,743;Where?

144;00:11:14,778;00:11:16,378;There.

145;00:11:23,486;00:11:26,355;There.

145;00:11:23,486;00:11:26,355;It's a back gate.

146;00:11:26,389;00:11:29,291;My men use it when they

146;00:11:26,389;00:11:29,291;visit Yunkai's bed slaves.

147;00:11:29,326;00:11:31,027;Your men, but not you?

148;00:11:31,061;00:11:32,695;I have no

148;00:11:31,061;00:11:32,695;interest in slaves.

149;00:11:32,730;00:11:34,998;A man cannot make love

149;00:11:32,730;00:11:34,998;to property.

150;00:11:38,236;00:11:39,903;This is where

150;00:11:38,236;00:11:39,903;we enter the city.

151;00:11:39,971;00:11:41,405;Very few guards.

151;00:11:39,971;00:11:41,405;They know me.

152;00:11:41,439;00:11:42,940;They let me inside--

153;00:11:42,974;00:11:45,209;We're not gonna sneak

153;00:11:42,974;00:11:45,209;an army through a back gate.

154;00:11:45,244;00:11:48,213;I kill the guards.

154;00:11:45,244;00:11:48,213;I take your two best men

155;00:11:48,247;00:11:51,616;and lead them through the back

155;00:11:48,247;00:11:51,616;streets, which I know well,

156;00:11:51,650;00:11:53,751;and open the front gates.

157;00:11:53,785;00:11:55,386;Then comes the army.

158;00:11:55,420;00:11:58,055;Once the walls are breached,

158;00:11:55,420;00:11:58,055;the city will fall in hours.

159;00:11:58,090;00:12:00,993;Or perhaps you'll lead Grey

159;00:11:58,090;00:12:00,993;Worm and me to the slaughter,

160;00:12:01,027;00:12:03,495;cutting the head off our army.

161;00:12:03,530;00:12:06,265;The masters of Yunkai

161;00:12:03,530;00:12:06,265;will pay you your fee

162;00:12:06,300;00:12:07,667;and you won't have

162;00:12:06,300;00:12:07,667;to split it three ways

163;00:12:07,701;00:12:09,702;'cause you've already

163;00:12:07,701;00:12:09,702;slaughtered your partners.

164;00:12:09,737;00:12:12,205;You have

164;00:12:09,737;00:12:12,205;a very suspicious mind.

165;00:12:12,239;00:12:15,308;In my experience, only dishonest

165;00:12:12,239;00:12:15,308;people think this way.

166;00:12:17,845;00:12:19,679;You command the Unsullied.

167;00:12:19,713;00:12:22,082;What do you think?

168;00:12:22,116;00:12:24,684;_

169;00:12:24,954;00:12:27,659;_

170;00:12:30,535;00:12:33,962;_

171;00:12:34,895;00:12:36,062;You leave tonight.

172;00:12:36,096;00:12:38,197;Very good.

173;00:12:38,231;00:12:40,032;We'll prepare.

174;00:12:45,104;00:12:46,738;Ser Jorah.

175;00:12:48,841;00:12:50,442;You can use an extra sword.

176;00:12:50,476;00:12:52,978;You're the Queensguard,

176;00:12:50,476;00:12:52,978;Ser Barristan.

177;00:12:53,012;00:12:55,047;Your place is by the queen.

178;00:12:55,081;00:12:57,516;If we are truly

178;00:12:55,081;00:12:57,516;her loyal servants,

179;00:12:57,550;00:12:59,585;we'll do whatever

179;00:12:57,550;00:12:59,585;needs to be done

180;00:12:59,619;00:13:03,756;no matter the cost,

180;00:12:59,619;00:13:03,756;no matter our pride.

181;00:13:06,827;00:13:09,329;We're west of Castle Black,

182;00:13:09,363;00:13:11,364;but the Nightfort's

182;00:13:09,363;00:13:11,364;closest to us.

183;00:13:11,431;00:13:14,534;It was the first

183;00:13:11,431;00:13:14,534;castle on the Wall.

184;00:13:14,568;00:13:17,970;The Watch abandoned it during

184;00:13:14,568;00:13:17,970;the reign of King Jaehaerys I.

185;00:13:18,005;00:13:21,674;Too big.

185;00:13:18,005;00:13:21,674;Impossible to maintain.

186;00:13:21,708;00:13:24,043;Other than Castle Black itself,

187;00:13:24,077;00:13:26,545;the Nightfort's

187;00:13:24,077;00:13:26,545;the perfect castle for us.

188;00:13:26,580;00:13:30,049;It's got a secret sally port,

189;00:13:30,117;00:13:32,685;the Black Gate,

189;00:13:30,117;00:13:32,685;as old as the Wall itself.

190;00:13:32,719;00:13:36,455;No one's used it

190;00:13:32,719;00:13:36,455;in centuries most likely.

191;00:13:36,489;00:13:39,157;It leads through the Wall

192;00:13:39,192;00:13:41,092;right down into the Nightfort,

193;00:13:41,127;00:13:42,994;if one knows how to find it,

194;00:13:43,029;00:13:45,930;which, it just

194;00:13:43,029;00:13:45,930;so happens, I do.

195;00:13:50,569;00:13:53,270;How do you know all that?

196;00:13:53,338;00:13:57,241;I read about it

196;00:13:53,338;00:13:57,241;in a very old book.

197;00:14:02,747;00:14:04,314;You know all that

198;00:14:04,348;00:14:07,283;from staring at marks on paper?

199;00:14:08,352;00:14:10,353;Yes.

200;00:14:10,421;00:14:13,156;You're like a wizard.

201;00:14:28,307;00:14:30,342;Our father used to tell us

202;00:14:30,376;00:14:34,747;that no wildling ever looked

202;00:14:30,376;00:14:34,747;upon the Wall and lived.

203;00:14:34,782;00:14:37,283;Here we are.

204;00:14:37,351;00:14:39,653;Alive.

205;00:14:55,903;00:14:58,671;Remember what happens

205;00:14:55,903;00:14:58,671;to children who run.

206;00:14:58,705;00:15:01,541;I'm your father

206;00:14:58,705;00:15:01,541;and I'll do the talking.

207;00:15:11,452;00:15:13,787;The roads have gone

207;00:15:11,452;00:15:13,787;right to hell, haven't they?

208;00:15:13,821;00:15:15,956;Cracked three spokes

208;00:15:13,821;00:15:15,956;this morning.

209;00:15:15,990;00:15:17,992;Need a hand?

209;00:15:15,990;00:15:17,992;Need about eight hands.

210;00:15:18,026;00:15:19,960;Oh!

211;00:15:19,994;00:15:22,162;Got to get this

211;00:15:19,994;00:15:22,162;salt pork to the Twins

212;00:15:22,197;00:15:24,798;in time for the wedding.

213;00:15:24,833;00:15:27,334;Many thanks.

214;00:15:29,504;00:15:31,071;Don't!

215;00:15:31,105;00:15:32,406;Don't kill him.

216;00:15:32,440;00:15:34,608;Dead rats don't squeak.

217;00:15:34,642;00:15:36,310;You're so dangerous,

217;00:15:34,642;00:15:36,310;aren't you?

218;00:15:36,377;00:15:38,378;Saying scary things

218;00:15:36,377;00:15:38,378;to little girls.

219;00:15:38,413;00:15:41,181;Killing little boys

219;00:15:38,413;00:15:41,181;and old people.

220;00:15:41,248;00:15:42,649;A real hard man you are.

221;00:15:42,683;00:15:44,651;More than anyone you know.

222;00:15:44,685;00:15:47,420;You're wrong.

222;00:15:44,685;00:15:47,420;I know a killer.

223;00:15:47,455;00:15:50,090;A real killer.

223;00:15:47,455;00:15:50,090;That so?

224;00:15:50,124;00:15:51,725;You'd be like a kitten to him.

225;00:15:51,759;00:15:54,094;He'd kill you

225;00:15:51,759;00:15:54,094;with his little finger.

226;00:15:54,128;00:15:56,229;That him?

227;00:15:57,598;00:15:59,632;No.

227;00:15:57,598;00:15:59,632;Good.

228;00:16:00,901;00:16:02,602;Don't kill him.

229;00:16:02,669;00:16:04,904;Please.

230;00:16:04,938;00:16:07,073;Please don't.

231;00:16:09,710;00:16:11,777;You're very kind.

232;00:16:11,812;00:16:13,779;Someday it'll get you killed.

233;00:16:31,131;00:16:32,965;Where are we?

234;00:16:33,032;00:16:35,200;The Gift, I think.

235;00:16:35,235;00:16:36,869;Brandon the Builder

235;00:16:35,235;00:16:36,869;gave all this land

236;00:16:36,903;00:16:38,971;south of the Wall

236;00:16:36,903;00:16:38,971;to the Night's Watch

237;00:16:39,006;00:16:41,941;for their sustenance

237;00:16:39,006;00:16:41,941;and support.

238;00:16:41,976;00:16:44,244;Maester Luwin taught me that.

239;00:16:46,047;00:16:48,315;Doesn't seem to be supporting

239;00:16:46,047;00:16:48,315;anyone at the moment.

240;00:16:48,349;00:16:52,052;It's good land

240;00:16:48,349;00:16:52,052;and there's no war up here.

241;00:16:52,086;00:16:53,587;Why leave?

242;00:16:53,654;00:16:55,322;Wildlings.

243;00:16:55,356;00:16:57,090;Sorry.

244;00:16:57,124;00:16:59,826;But they come over

244;00:16:57,124;00:16:59,826;the Wall and raid,

245;00:16:59,893;00:17:01,694;steal, carry off women.

246;00:17:01,728;00:17:03,929;Old Nan said they turn

246;00:17:01,728;00:17:03,929;your skull into a cup

247;00:17:03,964;00:17:06,031;and make you drink

247;00:17:03,964;00:17:06,031;your own blood from it.

248;00:17:08,701;00:17:10,402;That's what Old Nan said.

249;00:17:10,436;00:17:12,104;There's a storm coming.

250;00:17:13,473;00:17:15,774;I don't see any--

251;00:17:19,278;00:17:20,979;It's as good a place

251;00:17:19,278;00:17:20,979;to shelter as any.

252;00:17:24,250;00:17:26,585;We can drink some blood

252;00:17:24,250;00:17:26,585;while we wait.

253;00:17:26,652;00:17:28,753;I don't need much.

254;00:17:40,567;00:17:43,002;Only one old man

254;00:17:40,567;00:17:43,002;and eight good horses.

255;00:17:43,069;00:17:46,138;What's one old man

255;00:17:43,069;00:17:46,138;doing with eight horses?

256;00:17:46,172;00:17:48,039;He breeds them for the Watch.

257;00:17:48,074;00:17:50,042;How's he keep folks

257;00:17:48,074;00:17:50,042;from stealing them?

258;00:17:50,076;00:17:52,411;The Watch protects him.

259;00:17:52,446;00:17:54,680;Not today they don't.

260;00:17:54,715;00:17:57,384;He's selling horses,

260;00:17:54,715;00:17:57,384;he's got some gold in there.

261;00:17:57,418;00:18:00,620;- And proper steel.

261;00:17:57,418;00:18:00,620;Let's carve him up.

262;00:18:00,655;00:18:02,022;We just take the horses and go.

263;00:18:02,056;00:18:04,725;The old man's no threat.

264;00:18:05,761;00:18:07,194;I keep telling you.

265;00:18:07,228;00:18:09,363;He's an old man.

266;00:18:09,397;00:18:11,865;A spear through the heart's

266;00:18:09,397;00:18:11,865;a better way to die

267;00:18:11,933;00:18:14,373;than coughing up your last with

267;00:18:11,933;00:18:14,373;no one but your horses to hear.

268;00:18:15,904;00:18:19,239;The Watch might send a few men

268;00:18:15,904;00:18:19,239;looking for a horse thief.

269;00:18:19,274;00:18:22,142;They'll send a lot more

269;00:18:19,274;00:18:22,142;to hunt down murderers.

270;00:18:22,177;00:18:24,011;I hope so.

271;00:18:24,045;00:18:26,981;Killing crows

271;00:18:24,045;00:18:26,981;in their castle is tough.

272;00:18:27,016;00:18:28,950;Killing them out here

272;00:18:27,016;00:18:28,950;in the open,

273;00:18:29,017;00:18:30,685;that's what we do.

274;00:18:30,719;00:18:32,453;Spread out.

275;00:18:32,521;00:18:35,056;Surround the hut and move in.

276;00:19:17,833;00:19:19,066;Ygritte!

277;00:19:21,136;00:19:23,637;Clear the barn!

278;00:20:00,808;00:20:04,210;No one's going to believe you're a

278;00:20:00,808;00:20:04,210;hog farmer if you eat them all.

279;00:20:04,278;00:20:06,546;Best part of the animal.

280;00:20:11,253;00:20:13,454;Don't worry.

280;00:20:11,253;00:20:13,454;They're still there.

281;00:20:14,690;00:20:16,291;I know they're still there.

282;00:20:16,325;00:20:18,059;You check every five minutes

283;00:20:18,127;00:20:20,661;like you're afraid

283;00:20:18,127;00:20:20,661;they're gonna move.

284;00:20:20,696;00:20:22,463;I'm not afraid.

285;00:20:22,498;00:20:24,732;Of course you are.

286;00:20:24,767;00:20:27,068;You're almost there

287;00:20:27,102;00:20:29,704;and you're afraid

287;00:20:27,102;00:20:29,704;you won't make it.

288;00:20:29,772;00:20:33,141;The closer you get,

288;00:20:29,772;00:20:33,141;the worse the fear gets.

289;00:20:33,175;00:20:36,612;No point in trying to hide

289;00:20:33,175;00:20:36,612;behind that face.

290;00:20:36,646;00:20:39,548;I know fear when I see it.

291;00:20:39,582;00:20:41,450;Seen it a lot.

292;00:20:42,752;00:20:45,287;I knew fear

292;00:20:42,752;00:20:45,287;when I saw it in you.

293;00:20:46,756;00:20:49,559;You're afraid of fire.

294;00:20:49,627;00:20:51,328;When Beric's sword

294;00:20:49,627;00:20:51,328;went up in flames,

295;00:20:51,362;00:20:53,196;you looked like

295;00:20:51,362;00:20:53,196;a scared little girl.

296;00:20:56,835;00:20:59,169;And I know why, too.

297;00:21:01,039;00:21:03,474;I heard what

297;00:21:01,039;00:21:03,474;your brother did to you.

298;00:21:04,610;00:21:05,910;Pressed your face to the fire

299;00:21:05,978;00:21:08,546;like you're a nice

299;00:21:05,978;00:21:08,546;juicy mutton chop.

300;00:21:12,351;00:21:14,519;That give you some ideas?

301;00:21:17,356;00:21:20,025;Might do.

302;00:21:20,059;00:21:22,394;Go ahead, then.

303;00:21:22,428;00:21:24,796;You might get away.

304;00:21:24,831;00:21:27,366;Might even make it

304;00:21:24,831;00:21:27,366;there on your own.

305;00:21:28,434;00:21:30,669;They're just over the river.

306;00:21:30,703;00:21:32,838;The closest you've

306;00:21:30,703;00:21:32,838;been to family

307;00:21:32,872;00:21:35,907;since Ilyn Payne

307;00:21:32,872;00:21:35,907;snipped your daddy's neck.

308;00:21:39,345;00:21:42,347;Someday I'm gonna put

308;00:21:39,345;00:21:42,347;a sword through your eye

309;00:21:42,381;00:21:44,015;and out the back of your skull.

310;00:22:08,739;00:22:12,174;How are we going

310;00:22:08,739;00:22:12,174;to get past the Wall?

311;00:22:12,209;00:22:14,143;My uncle said

311;00:22:12,209;00:22:14,143;it's 700 feet high.

312;00:22:19,483;00:22:21,050;How did you get past it?

313;00:22:25,088;00:22:27,823;Got in a boat and rowed

313;00:22:25,088;00:22:27,823;past the Bay of Seals.

314;00:22:27,858;00:22:31,059;It would take us two months

314;00:22:27,858;00:22:31,059;to get to the Bay of Seals.

315;00:22:31,093;00:22:33,228;Some climb straight up the ice.

316;00:22:33,295;00:22:36,564;Even Hodor's not strong enough to

316;00:22:33,295;00:22:36,564;climb the Wall with me on his back.

317;00:22:36,632;00:22:39,801;Hodor.

318;00:22:39,835;00:22:42,370;19 castles guard the Wall.

319;00:22:42,405;00:22:45,774;Only three are still manned.

319;00:22:42,405;00:22:45,774;Hodor!

320;00:22:45,809;00:22:48,043;One of those abandoned fortresses

320;00:22:45,809;00:22:48,043;will give us a way through.

321;00:22:48,077;00:22:50,312;My uncle said the gates were

321;00:22:48,077;00:22:50,312;sealed with ice and stone

322;00:22:50,346;00:22:51,780;when the castles were deserted.

323;00:22:51,814;00:22:55,117;Well, we'll have

323;00:22:51,814;00:22:55,117;to open them up again.

324;00:22:56,720;00:22:59,455;Whoa, whoa, whoa!

324;00:22:56,720;00:22:59,455;- There's a rider out there.

325;00:23:00,758;00:23:02,692;Just one?

326;00:23:02,726;00:23:04,494;- There's more.

326;00:23:02,726;00:23:04,494;Hodor!

327;00:23:05,863;00:23:07,363;Shh. Shh.

328;00:23:07,398;00:23:10,133;It's just thunder, sweet giant.

328;00:23:07,398;00:23:10,133;Hodor.

329;00:23:10,201;00:23:12,535;I yield.

330;00:23:12,603;00:23:14,237;I yield.

330;00:23:12,603;00:23:14,237;Wildlings.

331;00:23:19,344;00:23:20,845;Where's Shaggydog and Summer?

332;00:23:20,879;00:23:22,880;Hunting.

333;00:23:22,948;00:23:24,916;Hodor!

334;00:23:24,950;00:23:27,251;Shh, quiet, Hodor.

334;00:23:24,950;00:23:27,251;Hodor!

335;00:23:27,319;00:23:29,286;Make him shut up.

335;00:23:27,319;00:23:29,286;If they hear us...

336;00:23:29,321;00:23:31,489;Hush, Hodor. No-- no more Hodoring.

336;00:23:29,321;00:23:31,489;Hodor!

337;00:23:31,523;00:23:34,425;Hodor!

337;00:23:31,523;00:23:34,425;Hodor, calm down.

338;00:23:34,460;00:23:35,793;You need to keep quiet.

338;00:23:34,460;00:23:35,793;They're gonna hear us.

339;00:23:35,828;00:23:37,995;Hodor, be quiet.

340;00:23:39,598;00:23:41,666;Ah! Hodor!

340;00:23:39,598;00:23:41,666;Hodor, calm down.

341;00:23:41,734;00:23:44,702;Hodor! Hodor!

341;00:23:41,734;00:23:44,702;Hodor, be quiet!

342;00:24:06,958;00:24:08,659;What did you do?

343;00:24:08,693;00:24:11,428;Nothing.

344;00:24:11,462;00:24:13,397;I don't know.

345;00:24:17,502;00:24:19,103;What's that?

346;00:24:20,338;00:24:22,607;That's a horse dying.

347;00:24:32,684;00:24:35,252;Bring them over here.

348;00:24:35,286;00:24:38,455;That was the last of them.

348;00:24:35,286;00:24:38,455;The rest are dead.

349;00:24:38,489;00:24:40,723;I heard shouting up there.

350;00:24:40,758;00:24:42,892;Thunder.

351;00:24:42,926;00:24:45,494;I know the difference

351;00:24:42,926;00:24:45,494;between shouting and thunder.

352;00:24:45,529;00:24:48,663;Maybe it's ghosts.

353;00:24:58,574;00:25:00,909;That won't help you, grandpa.

354;00:25:05,281;00:25:06,948;Where you riding?

355;00:25:06,982;00:25:08,983;Doesn't matter now, does it?

356;00:25:09,018;00:25:11,753;No, it doesn't matter now.

357;00:25:13,456;00:25:16,858;Cut his throat or he'll

357;00:25:13,456;00:25:16,858;tell the crows we're here.

358;00:25:22,765;00:25:24,499;You understand.

359;00:25:24,534;00:25:26,501;Let me stand at least.

360;00:25:27,770;00:25:29,938;Let me go

360;00:25:27,770;00:25:29,938;with a bit of dignity.

361;00:25:34,977;00:25:36,678;Make the crow kill him.

362;00:25:40,216;00:25:43,619;You're one of us now.

362;00:25:40,216;00:25:43,619;Prove it.

363;00:25:47,825;00:25:50,427;The wolves are out there.

364;00:25:53,331;00:25:55,065;I can't do it by choice.

365;00:25:55,100;00:25:59,137;I don't know how.

365;00:25:55,100;00:25:59,137;It happens in my dreams.

366;00:25:59,171;00:26:01,273;You're a warg, Bran.

367;00:26:01,307;00:26:03,375;It's in your blood.

368;00:26:03,409;00:26:04,877;I can't.

369;00:26:04,911;00:26:06,812;You just did with him.

370;00:26:06,880;00:26:08,848;A wolf is nothing

370;00:26:06,880;00:26:08,848;compared to that.

371;00:26:16,556;00:26:18,290;She looks sharp.

372;00:26:27,901;00:26:29,970;Do it.

373;00:26:30,972;00:26:32,439;Do it.

374;00:26:32,473;00:26:35,608;I told you.

374;00:26:32,473;00:26:35,608;He's still one of them.

375;00:26:37,811;00:26:39,378;Go on, boy.

376;00:26:42,282;00:26:43,582;Go on!

377;00:26:52,358;00:26:54,159;He's a crow.

378;00:26:54,193;00:26:56,127;He'll always be a crow.

379;00:26:56,162;00:26:58,529;And here's his crow wife

379;00:26:56,162;00:26:58,529;guarding him.

380;00:26:58,563;00:27:01,766;He'll stab us in the back

380;00:26:58,563;00:27:01,766;first chance he gets.

381;00:27:04,703;00:27:07,071;Kill him.

382;00:27:22,354;00:27:24,389;He's one of them.

382;00:27:22,354;00:27:24,389;No!

383;00:27:24,423;00:27:25,923;Do you hear me?

384;00:27:31,931;00:27:35,233;You're not gonna die

384;00:27:31,931;00:27:35,233;for one of them.

385;00:27:37,036;00:27:39,538;Do it.

386;00:27:39,572;00:27:41,406;They'll find us if you don't.

387;00:28:11,106;00:28:13,074;You were right the whole time.

388;00:28:39,066;00:28:40,633;Hyah!

389;00:28:59,687;00:29:02,322;When you hear a

389;00:28:59,687;00:29:02,322;songbird's whistle, you come.

390;00:29:02,356;00:29:06,126;I'm a great whistler.

390;00:29:02,356;00:29:06,126;The greatest in the land.

391;00:29:11,004;00:29:14,100;Daario Naharis.

392;00:29:41,995;00:29:44,363;That one was quick.

393;00:29:47,133;00:29:49,167;There may be others.

393;00:29:47,133;00:29:49,167;I doubt it.

394;00:29:49,202;00:29:52,070;The Yunkish prefer to let their

394;00:29:49,202;00:29:52,070;slaves do their fighting for them.

395;00:30:37,285;00:30:39,987;That's what you call

395;00:30:37,285;00:30:39,987;a few guards?

396;00:31:04,180;00:31:06,381;Come on!

396;00:31:04,180;00:31:06,381;What do you got, huh?

397;00:32:20,454;00:32:23,156;Lord Edmure...

398;00:32:24,826;00:32:27,094;I hope I'm not

398;00:32:24,826;00:32:27,094;a disappointment to you.

399;00:32:35,637;00:32:38,106;You're a delight

399;00:32:35,637;00:32:38,106;to me, my lady.

400;00:32:39,742;00:32:41,410;You may now cloak the bride

401;00:32:41,444;00:32:43,512;and bring her under

401;00:32:41,444;00:32:43,512;your protection.

402;00:33:12,576;00:33:14,176;In the sight of the Seven,

403;00:33:14,211;00:33:17,880;I hereby seal these two souls,

404;00:33:17,915;00:33:21,517;binding them as one

404;00:33:17,915;00:33:21,517;for eternity.

405;00:33:21,552;00:33:24,487;Look upon each other

405;00:33:21,552;00:33:24,487;and say the words.

406;00:33:27,057;00:33:29,325;Father, Smith,

407;00:33:29,393;00:33:31,727;Warrior, Mother,

408;00:33:31,762;00:33:34,798;Maiden, Crone, Stranger...

409;00:33:34,832;00:33:36,933;I am hers...

409;00:33:34,832;00:33:36,933;I am his...

410;00:33:36,968;00:33:39,102;and she is mine...

410;00:33:36,968;00:33:39,102;and he is mine...

411;00:33:39,137;00:33:43,140;...from this day

411;00:33:39,137;00:33:43,140;until the end of my days.

412;00:33:47,846;00:33:50,715;Is that safe?

412;00:33:47,846;00:33:50,715;They're long gone.

413;00:33:56,154;00:33:57,687;You were right.

414;00:33:57,755;00:34:00,256;I can get inside Summer's

414;00:33:57,755;00:34:00,256;mind whenever I want.

415;00:34:00,323;00:34:02,491;Of course you can.

416;00:34:03,793;00:34:05,093;North of the Wall

416;00:34:03,793;00:34:05,093;there are wildlings

417;00:34:05,128;00:34:08,129;who can control

417;00:34:05,128;00:34:08,129;all sorts of animals.

418;00:34:08,164;00:34:10,498;But you did a lot

418;00:34:08,164;00:34:10,498;more than that.

419;00:34:12,301;00:34:15,403;You got inside Hodor's mind.

420;00:34:15,437;00:34:18,272;They can't do that

420;00:34:15,437;00:34:18,272;north of the Wall?

421;00:34:20,610;00:34:22,711;No one can do that...

422;00:34:22,745;00:34:23,846;anywhere.

423;00:34:30,520;00:34:33,155;When I was looking

423;00:34:30,520;00:34:33,155;through Summer's eyes,

424;00:34:33,189;00:34:34,856;I saw Jon.

424;00:34:33,189;00:34:34,856;Where?

425;00:34:34,891;00:34:36,658;He was with the wildlings.

426;00:34:36,692;00:34:38,727;They tried to kill him,

426;00:34:36,692;00:34:38,727;but he got away.

427;00:34:38,761;00:34:40,395;He'll be heading back

427;00:34:38,761;00:34:40,395;to Castle Black, then.

428;00:34:40,430;00:34:42,264;That's where we should go.

429;00:34:42,298;00:34:44,666;For all we know, Castle

429;00:34:42,298;00:34:44,666;Black's already under attack.

430;00:34:44,701;00:34:47,502;If this many wildlings got through--

430;00:34:44,701;00:34:47,502;I already told you.

431;00:34:47,570;00:34:49,538;I'm not going

431;00:34:47,570;00:34:49,538;north of the Wall.

432;00:34:49,572;00:34:52,541;Everything Jojen

432;00:34:49,572;00:34:52,541;told me is true.

433;00:34:54,477;00:34:56,745;You saw what I did to Hodor.

434;00:34:56,779;00:34:58,747;I have to find

434;00:34:56,779;00:34:58,747;the three-eyed raven.

435;00:34:58,781;00:35:00,349;Listen to me, little lord.

436;00:35:00,383;00:35:01,616;Don't worry.

437;00:35:01,650;00:35:04,753;I'm not asking you

437;00:35:01,650;00:35:04,753;to come with me.

438;00:35:06,690;00:35:08,457;It won't be safe for Rickon.

439;00:35:08,492;00:35:11,561;Me?

439;00:35:08,492;00:35:11,561;I'm coming with you.

440;00:35:11,595;00:35:14,097;No.

441;00:35:14,131;00:35:16,766;You and Osha and Shaggydog

441;00:35:14,131;00:35:16,766;head for the Last Hearth.

442;00:35:16,801;00:35:20,003;The Umbers are our bannermen.

442;00:35:16,801;00:35:20,003;They'll protect you.

443;00:35:20,038;00:35:21,772;I'm coming with you.

444;00:35:21,806;00:35:23,674;I'm your brother.

445;00:35:23,708;00:35:26,010;I have to protect you.

446;00:35:27,913;00:35:31,248;Right now I have

446;00:35:27,913;00:35:31,248;to protect you.

447;00:35:31,283;00:35:34,418;Robb's at war and I'm

447;00:35:31,283;00:35:34,418;going beyond the Wall.

448;00:35:34,452;00:35:36,821;If something happens to us,

449;00:35:36,855;00:35:38,923;you're the heir to Winterfell.

450;00:35:40,959;00:35:43,161;Would you know how

450;00:35:40,959;00:35:43,161;to find the Last Hearth?

451;00:35:43,195;00:35:46,298;You southerners build your big

451;00:35:43,195;00:35:46,298;castles and you never move.

452;00:35:46,332;00:35:47,966;You're easy to find.

453;00:35:48,034;00:35:50,736;We're not southerners.

454;00:35:50,770;00:35:53,839;And I don't want to leave you.

455;00:35:53,873;00:35:56,675;Shh, shh.

455;00:35:53,873;00:35:56,675;Come here, little soldier.

456;00:35:58,144;00:36:01,747;You and me, we're gonna

456;00:35:58,144;00:36:01,747;have some adventures.

457;00:36:01,782;00:36:04,150;You don't have to do

457;00:36:01,782;00:36:04,150;any of this.

458;00:36:05,485;00:36:06,952;Your family took me in

459;00:36:06,987;00:36:09,322;and was good to me when

459;00:36:06,987;00:36:09,322;they had no cause to be.

460;00:36:09,356;00:36:11,691;Shh.

461;00:36:11,725;00:36:13,993;We'll be fine, you and me.

462;00:36:14,027;00:36:16,262;The Umbers are great warriors.

463;00:36:16,296;00:36:18,931;Even I heard

463;00:36:16,296;00:36:18,931;about them growing up.

464;00:36:18,966;00:36:21,334;They'll teach you

464;00:36:18,966;00:36:21,334;how to swing a sword.

465;00:36:21,368;00:36:24,904;I know how to swing a sword.

466;00:36:31,811;00:36:34,580;You're leaving now? It's

466;00:36:31,811;00:36:34,580;the middle of the night.

467;00:36:34,614;00:36:36,482;I learned to walk in darkness.

468;00:36:38,952;00:36:40,653;Say your good-byes,

468;00:36:38,952;00:36:40,653;little man.

469;00:36:48,594;00:36:50,829;Keep this one safe.

470;00:36:52,598;00:36:54,665;He means the world to me.

471;00:37:15,756;00:37:18,290;We've been waiting a long time.

472;00:37:20,527;00:37:22,328;Haven't we?

473;00:37:23,830;00:37:25,264;I don't know, you tell me.

474;00:37:25,299;00:37:27,500;How long does it take

474;00:37:25,299;00:37:27,500;to sack a city?

475;00:37:35,742;00:37:37,843;It was just as you said.

476;00:37:37,877;00:37:41,279;They did not believe

476;00:37:37,877;00:37:41,279;until it was too late.

477;00:37:41,313;00:37:43,314;Their slave soldiers

478;00:37:43,349;00:37:46,818;threw down their spears

478;00:37:43,349;00:37:46,818;and surrendered.

479;00:37:50,922;00:37:53,491;And Daario Naharis?

480;00:38:14,048;00:38:16,616;The city is yours, my queen.

481;00:38:39,741;00:38:41,275;They're good, aren't they?

482;00:38:41,309;00:38:43,043;They ought to be

482;00:38:41,309;00:38:43,043;because they cost enough.

483;00:38:50,252;00:38:53,454;Look at the crowd there.

484;00:38:56,891;00:38:59,093;He complained

484;00:38:56,891;00:38:59,093;about this marriage

485;00:38:59,160;00:39:01,362;the entire ride from Riverrun,

486;00:39:01,396;00:39:02,897;and now look at him.

487;00:39:02,931;00:39:04,898;The gods

487;00:39:02,931;00:39:04,898;love to reward a fool.

488;00:39:04,933;00:39:07,434;Uncle.

488;00:39:04,933;00:39:07,434;What?

489;00:39:07,468;00:39:10,437;He's my nephew.

489;00:39:07,468;00:39:10,437;I love him.

490;00:39:10,471;00:39:12,473;And he's a damned fool.

491;00:39:17,845;00:39:20,247;Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?

492;00:39:20,281;00:39:22,583;Never do, my lady.

492;00:39:20,281;00:39:22,583;Dulls the senses.

493;00:39:22,617;00:39:24,852;That's the point.

494;00:39:24,886;00:39:26,687;Didn't you marry

494;00:39:24,886;00:39:26,687;one of these Frey girls?

495;00:39:26,721;00:39:28,189;Aye.

496;00:39:28,223;00:39:30,291;Lord Walder let me choose

496;00:39:28,223;00:39:30,291;any of his granddaughters

497;00:39:30,325;00:39:34,428;and promised me the girl's

497;00:39:30,325;00:39:34,428;weight in silver as a dowry.

498;00:39:34,496;00:39:36,297;So I have a fat young bride.

499;00:39:38,333;00:39:40,301;I hope she makes you

499;00:39:38,333;00:39:40,301;very happy.

500;00:39:40,335;00:39:42,136;Well, she's made me very rich.

501;00:39:42,204;00:39:44,806;Pardon, my lord, my lady.

502;00:39:44,840;00:39:47,308;I need to find

502;00:39:44,840;00:39:47,308;a tree to piss on.

503;00:39:49,378;00:39:51,713;My mother's alone

503;00:39:49,378;00:39:51,713;with Roose Bolton.

504;00:39:51,780;00:39:53,181;I should rescue her.

505;00:39:53,215;00:39:55,149;Your mother is less

505;00:39:53,215;00:39:55,149;in need of rescue

506;00:39:55,184;00:39:57,151;than any woman I've ever met.

507;00:39:57,186;00:39:58,253;Be kind.

508;00:39:58,287;00:40:00,288;She's finally starting

508;00:39:58,287;00:40:00,288;to like you.

509;00:40:01,957;00:40:03,758;And I like her.

510;00:40:03,793;00:40:06,995;But if she had her way,

510;00:40:03,793;00:40:06,995;I would be back in Volantis

511;00:40:07,029;00:40:10,298;playing my harp and you

511;00:40:07,029;00:40:10,298;would be sitting over there

512;00:40:10,333;00:40:13,335;eating blackberries

512;00:40:10,333;00:40:13,335;out of Roslin Frey's hand.

513;00:40:13,369;00:40:15,537;Perhaps I've made

513;00:40:13,369;00:40:15,537;a terrible mistake.

514;00:40:18,441;00:40:21,343;Striking your king

514;00:40:18,441;00:40:21,343;is an act of treason.

515;00:40:24,681;00:40:26,449;No, don't.

516;00:40:27,384;00:40:29,018;Don't insult them.

517;00:40:31,688;00:40:33,689;Your Grace.

518;00:40:40,463;00:40:44,366;The septon has prayed

518;00:40:40,463;00:40:44,366;his prayers,

519;00:40:44,400;00:40:46,601;some words were said,

520;00:40:46,636;00:40:48,436;and Lord Edmure

521;00:40:48,504;00:40:51,405;has wrapped my daughter

521;00:40:48,504;00:40:51,405;in a cloak.

522;00:40:51,440;00:40:55,877;But they are not yet

522;00:40:51,440;00:40:55,877;man and wife.

523;00:40:55,911;00:40:58,480;A sword needs a sheath.

524;00:41:04,720;00:41:08,289;And a wedding needs a bedding.

525;00:41:08,324;00:41:10,191;What does my sire say?

526;00:41:10,226;00:41:13,228;To bed! To bed! To bed!

527;00:41:18,534;00:41:20,936;If you think the time

527;00:41:18,534;00:41:20,936;is right, Lord Walder,

528;00:41:20,970;00:41:25,173;by all means, let us bed them.

529;00:41:31,781;00:41:34,450;To bed! To bed! To bed!

530;00:41:40,457;00:41:42,959;Go on!

531;00:42:00,645;00:42:03,747;Oh!

531;00:42:00,645;00:42:03,747;Careful now, ladies.

532;00:42:03,781;00:42:05,815;Once you set that monster free,

533;00:42:05,850;00:42:08,618;there's no caging him again.

534;00:42:08,652;00:42:11,954;To bed! To bed! To bed!

535;00:42:15,692;00:42:17,293;Poor girl.

536;00:42:17,327;00:42:20,229;Every bride suffers the same.

537;00:42:20,263;00:42:22,865;I'm sure you endured

537;00:42:20,263;00:42:22,865;yours with grace.

538;00:42:22,899;00:42:25,401;Oh, Ned forbade it.

539;00:42:25,436;00:42:28,638;He said it wouldn't be right if he broke

539;00:42:25,436;00:42:28,638;a man's jaw on our wedding night.

540;00:42:37,115;00:42:40,216;That is a very strange custom.

541;00:42:40,251;00:42:42,152;I suppose it does seem strange

542;00:42:42,186;00:42:43,853;from a foreigner's perspective.

543;00:42:43,888;00:42:45,689;It seems normal to you?

544;00:42:45,756;00:42:48,125;It's a tradition.

545;00:42:49,961;00:42:52,829;Without the bedding ceremony,

545;00:42:49,961;00:42:52,829;there's no real proof

546;00:42:52,864;00:42:55,399;the lord and lady

546;00:42:52,864;00:42:55,399;consummated their marriage.

547;00:42:55,433;00:42:58,769;But there are other ways

547;00:42:55,433;00:42:58,769;of providing proof.

548;00:43:01,139;00:43:02,906;Boy or girl?

549;00:43:05,277;00:43:06,978;I don't know.

550;00:43:07,012;00:43:10,181;But if it's a boy, I know

550;00:43:07,012;00:43:10,181;what we should name him.

551;00:43:10,215;00:43:12,383;Oh, do you?

552;00:43:12,417;00:43:15,854;It seems to me the father should

552;00:43:12,417;00:43:15,854;have some say in his son's naming.

553;00:43:15,921;00:43:17,255;Eddard.

554;00:43:20,926;00:43:22,961;Don't you want to teach

554;00:43:20,926;00:43:22,961;little Ned Stark

555;00:43:22,995;00:43:25,430;how to ride horses?

556;00:43:25,464;00:43:27,665;I do.

557;00:44:23,587;00:44:25,755;Go on, line 'em up!

558;00:44:42,408;00:44:44,810;Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

559;00:44:48,081;00:44:49,615;Where are you going?

560;00:44:49,650;00:44:51,383;Got salt pork for the feast.

561;00:44:51,451;00:44:53,618;The feast is over.

562;00:44:53,653;00:44:56,054;Doesn't sound

562;00:44:53,653;00:44:56,054;like it's over.

563;00:44:56,088;00:44:58,956;If I tell you

563;00:44:56,088;00:44:58,956;it's over, it's over.

564;00:44:58,991;00:45:03,193;Turn this cart around

564;00:44:58,991;00:45:03,193;and get the hell out of here.

565;00:45:03,228;00:45:05,195;Got pig's feet, too.

566;00:45:06,363;00:45:08,464;Are you soft in the head?

567;00:45:08,499;00:45:10,233;Turn this cart around.

568;00:45:22,879;00:45:24,513;Your Grace.

569;00:45:30,354;00:45:34,690;I feel I've been remiss

570;00:45:34,724;00:45:36,458;in my duties.

571;00:45:36,492;00:45:40,196;I've given you meat

571;00:45:36,492;00:45:40,196;and wine and music,

572;00:45:40,230;00:45:42,898;but I haven't shown you

573;00:45:42,933;00:45:46,001;the hospitality you deserve.

574;00:45:47,170;00:45:48,638;My king has married

575;00:45:48,672;00:45:52,108;and I owe my new queen

575;00:45:48,672;00:45:52,108;a wedding gift.

576;00:45:56,881;00:45:59,383;Robb!

577;00:46:46,195;00:46:48,296;You ready to

577;00:46:46,195;00:46:48,296;head home to Winterfell, right?

578;00:46:51,534;00:46:53,034;Feast over yet, is it?

579;00:46:53,069;00:46:55,570;Aye, it's over.

580;00:47:25,901;00:47:27,701;Follow him.

581;00:47:30,205;00:47:32,506;Aim!

582;00:48:01,171;00:48:03,506;It's too late.

583;00:48:44,346;00:48:47,448;The King in the North arises.

584;00:49:09,105;00:49:11,306;Lord Walder!

585;00:49:11,374;00:49:12,974;Lord Walder, enough!

586;00:49:13,008;00:49:15,443;Let it end!

587;00:49:17,046;00:49:19,080;Please.

588;00:49:19,147;00:49:21,249;He is my son.

589;00:49:21,316;00:49:23,584;My first son.

590;00:49:23,619;00:49:26,187;Let him go and I swear

590;00:49:23,619;00:49:26,187;that we will forget this.

591;00:49:26,222;00:49:28,890;I swear it by

591;00:49:26,222;00:49:28,890;the old gods and new.

592;00:49:28,924;00:49:30,425;We will take no vengeance.

593;00:49:30,460;00:49:34,129;You already swore me one oath

593;00:49:30,460;00:49:34,129;right here in my castle.

594;00:49:34,164;00:49:37,966;You swore by all the gods your

594;00:49:34,164;00:49:37,966;son would marry my daughter!

595;00:49:38,001;00:49:41,336;Take me for a

595;00:49:38,001;00:49:41,336;hostage, but let Robb go.

596;00:49:41,371;00:49:43,538;Robb, get up.

597;00:49:43,573;00:49:45,307;Get up and walk out.

598;00:49:45,341;00:49:47,742;Please!

599;00:49:49,412;00:49:52,147;Please!

600;00:49:52,181;00:49:56,018;And why would I

600;00:49:52,181;00:49:56,018;let him do that?

601;00:49:58,655;00:50:01,390;On my honor as a Tully,

602;00:50:01,458;00:50:04,193;on my honor as a Stark,

603;00:50:04,261;00:50:07,096;let him go

604;00:50:07,130;00:50:10,233;or I will cut

604;00:50:07,130;00:50:10,233;your wife's throat.

605;00:50:18,709;00:50:21,310;I'll find another.

606;00:50:24,081;00:50:26,549;Mother.

607;00:50:27,613;00:50:29,318;The Lannisters send

607;00:50:27,613;00:50:29,318;their regards.
