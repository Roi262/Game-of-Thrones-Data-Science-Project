46;00:04:14,552;00:04:17,501;I'll give you one try, girl.

47;00:04:20,071;00:04:22,206;Kill me and you're free.

48;00:04:22,240;00:04:25,976;But if I live,

48;00:04:22,240;00:04:25,976;I'll break both your hands.

49;00:04:28,179;00:04:30,047;Go on, hit me.

50;00:04:30,081;00:04:32,783;Hit me hard.

51;00:04:42,593;00:04:44,727;Sulk all you want.

52;00:04:44,762;00:04:47,630;The truth is, you're lucky.

53;00:04:48,866;00:04:51,434;You don't want to be

53;00:04:48,866;00:04:51,434;alone out here, girl.

54;00:04:51,468;00:04:54,069;Someone worse than me

54;00:04:51,468;00:04:54,069;would find you.

55;00:04:54,103;00:04:55,651;There's no one worse than you.

56;00:04:55,774;00:04:57,975;Ha, you never knew my brother.

57;00:04:58,009;00:05:00,544;He once killed a man

57;00:04:58,009;00:05:00,544;for snoring.

58;00:05:00,579;00:05:03,114;There's plenty worse than me.

59;00:05:03,148;00:05:05,649;There's men who like

59;00:05:03,148;00:05:05,649;to beat little girls,

60;00:05:05,684;00:05:07,718;men who like to rape them.

61;00:05:07,752;00:05:09,854;I saved your sister

61;00:05:07,752;00:05:09,854;from some of them.

62;00:05:11,757;00:05:13,157;You're lying.

63;00:05:13,192;00:05:15,259;Ask her, if you

63;00:05:13,192;00:05:15,259;ever see her again.

64;00:05:15,294;00:05:16,994;Ask her who came back for her

65;00:05:17,029;00:05:19,864;when the mob

65;00:05:17,029;00:05:19,864;had her on her back.

66;00:05:21,466;00:05:23,301;They would have

66;00:05:21,466;00:05:23,301;taken her every which way

67;00:05:23,335;00:05:25,836;and left her there

67;00:05:23,335;00:05:25,836;with her throat cut open.

68;00:05:32,044;00:05:33,545;Is that the Blackwater?

69;00:05:33,579;00:05:36,014;The Blackwater?

70;00:05:36,048;00:05:38,382;Where do you think

70;00:05:36,048;00:05:38,382;I'm taking you?

71;00:05:39,952;00:05:43,121;Back to King's Landing

71;00:05:39,952;00:05:43,121;to Joffrey and the queen.

72;00:05:43,155;00:05:45,890;Fuck Joffrey.

72;00:05:43,155;00:05:45,890;Fuck the queen.

73;00:05:45,924;00:05:47,826;That's the Red Fork.

74;00:05:47,860;00:05:50,328;I'm taking you to the Twins.

75;00:05:51,731;00:05:53,565;But why?

76;00:05:53,600;00:05:56,268;Because your mother

76;00:05:53,600;00:05:56,268;and brother will be there

77;00:05:56,302;00:05:58,403;and they'll pay me for you.

78;00:06:00,340;00:06:02,908;Why would they be at the Twins?

79;00:06:02,943;00:06:06,813;Those outlaws you

79;00:06:02,943;00:06:06,813;love so much never told you?

80;00:06:06,847;00:06:09,482;The whole countryside

80;00:06:06,847;00:06:09,482;is yapping about it.

81;00:06:10,784;00:06:14,020;Your uncle is marrying

81;00:06:10,784;00:06:14,020;one of the Frey girls.

82;00:06:14,055;00:06:16,055;So quit trying

82;00:06:14,055;00:06:16,055;to bash my skull in

83;00:06:16,090;00:06:18,725;and we might just make it there

83;00:06:16,090;00:06:18,725;in time for the wedding.

84;00:06:36,609;00:06:39,577;Men who fight for gold have

84;00:06:36,609;00:06:39,577;neither honor nor loyalty.

85;00:06:39,612;00:06:41,179;They cannot be trusted.

86;00:06:41,213;00:06:43,848;They can be trusted to

86;00:06:41,213;00:06:43,848;kill you if they're well paid.

87;00:06:43,883;00:06:46,151;The Yunkish

87;00:06:43,883;00:06:46,151;are paying them well.

88;00:06:46,185;00:06:47,919;You know these men?

89;00:06:47,953;00:06:50,621;Only by the broken swords

89;00:06:47,953;00:06:50,621;on their banners.

90;00:06:50,656;00:06:53,457;They're called the Second Sons.

91;00:06:53,492;00:06:56,393;A company led by

91;00:06:53,492;00:06:56,393;a Braavosi named Mero,

92;00:06:56,427;00:06:59,062;The Titan's Bastard.

93;00:06:59,096;00:07:01,464;Is he more titan or bastard?

94;00:07:01,499;00:07:03,767;He's a dangerous man, khaleesi.

95;00:07:03,801;00:07:05,836;They all are.

96;00:07:07,739;00:07:09,173;How many?

97;00:07:09,207;00:07:11,776;2,000, Your Grace.

98;00:07:11,810;00:07:13,478;Armored and mounted.

99;00:07:13,512;00:07:15,714;Enough to make a difference?

100;00:07:19,319;00:07:22,353;It's hard to collect

100;00:07:19,319;00:07:22,353;wages from a corpse.

101;00:07:22,388;00:07:25,190;I'm sure the sellswords prefer

101;00:07:22,388;00:07:25,190;to fight for the winning side.

102;00:07:25,224;00:07:27,225;I imagine you're right.

103;00:07:27,259;00:07:31,496;I'd like to talk to the Titan's

103;00:07:27,259;00:07:31,496;Bastard about winning.

104;00:07:31,564;00:07:33,599;He may not agree to meet.

105;00:07:33,633;00:07:35,067;He will.

106;00:07:35,101;00:07:38,804;A man who fights for gold can't

106;00:07:35,101;00:07:38,804;afford to lose to a girl.

107;00:07:38,838;00:07:41,407;Your Grace, allow me to present

108;00:07:41,441;00:07:44,409;the captains

108;00:07:41,441;00:07:44,409;of the Second Sons--

109;00:07:44,444;00:07:47,445;Mero of Braavos,

110;00:07:47,480;00:07:50,548;Prendahl na Ghezn,

111;00:07:50,583;00:07:52,017;and...

112;00:07:52,051;00:07:54,552;Daario Naharis.

113;00:07:58,757;00:08:00,791;You are the Mother of Dragons?

114;00:08:02,294;00:08:04,729;I swear I fucked you once

114;00:08:02,294;00:08:04,729;in a pleasure house in Lys.

115;00:08:04,763;00:08:07,498;Mind your tongue.

115;00:08:04,763;00:08:07,498;- Why?

116;00:08:07,533;00:08:09,935;I didn't mind hers.

117;00:08:09,969;00:08:12,871;She licked my ass

117;00:08:09,969;00:08:12,871;like she was born to do it.

118;00:08:15,676;00:08:18,511;You, slave girl, bring wine.

119;00:08:18,546;00:08:20,847;We have no slaves here.

120;00:08:20,881;00:08:22,882;You'll all be slaves

120;00:08:20,881;00:08:22,882;after the battle

121;00:08:22,916;00:08:25,018;unless I save you.

122;00:08:26,887;00:08:29,456;Take your clothes off and

122;00:08:26,887;00:08:29,456;come and sit on Mero's lap

123;00:08:29,490;00:08:31,258;and I may give you

123;00:08:29,490;00:08:31,258;my Second Sons.

124;00:08:31,292;00:08:34,161;Give me your Second Sons

124;00:08:31,292;00:08:34,161;and I may not have you gelded.

125;00:08:34,195;00:08:37,364;Ser Barristan, how many men

125;00:08:34,195;00:08:37,364;fight for the Second Sons?

126;00:08:37,398;00:08:39,833;Under 2,000, Your Grace.

127;00:08:39,868;00:08:41,535;We have more, don't we?

128;00:08:41,570;00:08:44,104;10,000 Unsullied.

129;00:08:44,139;00:08:46,139;I'm only a young girl,

129;00:08:44,139;00:08:46,139;new to the ways of war,

130;00:08:46,174;00:08:48,208;but perhaps a seasoned

130;00:08:46,174;00:08:48,208;captain like yourself

131;00:08:48,243;00:08:51,679;can explain to me how you

131;00:08:48,243;00:08:51,679;propose to defeat us.

132;00:08:51,714;00:08:54,548;I hope the old man is better with

132;00:08:51,714;00:08:54,548;a sword than he is with a lie.

133;00:08:54,583;00:08:57,552;You have 8,000 Unsullied.

134;00:08:59,855;00:09:01,923;You're very young

134;00:08:59,855;00:09:01,923;to be a captain.

135;00:09:01,957;00:09:04,559;He's not a captain.

135;00:09:01,957;00:09:04,559;He's a lieutenant.

136;00:09:04,593;00:09:06,628;Even if your numbers are right,

137;00:09:06,662;00:09:08,963;you must admit the odds

137;00:09:06,662;00:09:08,963;don't favor your side.

138;00:09:08,998;00:09:11,032;The Second Sons have faced

138;00:09:08,998;00:09:11,032;worse odds and won.

139;00:09:11,067;00:09:13,801;The Second Sons have

139;00:09:11,067;00:09:13,801;faced worse odds and run.

140;00:09:15,437;00:09:16,972;Or you could fight for me.

141;00:09:19,909;00:09:21,976;We've taken the slavers' gold.

142;00:09:22,011;00:09:23,745;We fight for Yunkai.

143;00:09:23,779;00:09:27,048;I would pay

143;00:09:23,779;00:09:27,048;you as much and more. -

144;00:09:28,350;00:09:30,218;Our contract is our bond.

145;00:09:30,285;00:09:31,752;If we break our bond,

146;00:09:31,787;00:09:33,955;no one will hire

146;00:09:31,787;00:09:33,955;the Second Sons again.

147;00:09:33,989;00:09:37,225;Ride with me and you'll

147;00:09:33,989;00:09:37,225;never need another contract.

148;00:09:37,259;00:09:40,661;You'll have gold and castles

148;00:09:37,259;00:09:40,661;and lordships of your choosing

149;00:09:40,696;00:09:42,263;when I take back

149;00:09:40,696;00:09:42,263;the Seven Kingdoms.

150;00:09:42,297;00:09:44,799;You have no ships.

150;00:09:42,297;00:09:44,799;You have no siege weapons.

151;00:09:44,833;00:09:46,501;You have no cavalry.

152;00:09:46,568;00:09:49,070;A fortnight ago, I had no army.

153;00:09:49,104;00:09:51,439;A year ago, I had no dragons.

154;00:09:54,043;00:09:56,043;You have two days to decide.

155;00:09:59,014;00:10:02,016;Show me your cunt. I want to see

155;00:09:59,014;00:10:02,016;if it's worth fighting for.

156;00:10:02,050;00:10:05,385;_

157;00:10:05,505;00:10:07,989;_

158;00:10:08,823;00:10:10,590;You seem to be

158;00:10:08,823;00:10:10,590;enjoying my wine.

159;00:10:10,658;00:10:13,126;Perhaps you'd like

159;00:10:10,658;00:10:13,126;a flagon to help you ponder.

160;00:10:13,160;00:10:14,961;Only a flagon?

161;00:10:14,995;00:10:17,029;And what are my brothers

161;00:10:14,995;00:10:17,029;in arms to drink?

162;00:10:17,064;00:10:19,698;A barrel, then.

162;00:10:17,064;00:10:19,698;Good.

163;00:10:19,732;00:10:23,168;The Titan's Bastard

163;00:10:19,732;00:10:23,168;does not drink alone.

164;00:10:25,672;00:10:27,874;In the Second Sons,

164;00:10:25,672;00:10:27,874;we share everything.

165;00:10:27,908;00:10:30,309;After the battle,

165;00:10:27,908;00:10:30,309;maybe we'll all share you.

166;00:10:35,682;00:10:37,917;I'll come looking for you

166;00:10:35,682;00:10:37,917;when this is over.

167;00:10:41,321;00:10:43,222;Ser Barristan,

168;00:10:43,256;00:10:47,193;if it comes to battle,

168;00:10:43,256;00:10:47,193;kill that one first.

169;00:10:47,227;00:10:49,362;Gladly, Your Grace.

170;00:11:42,482;00:11:44,884;Half Robert, half lowborn.

171;00:11:46,820;00:11:48,421;Show the boy to his chambers.

172;00:11:48,455;00:11:51,725;Have the maids draw him a bath and

172;00:11:48,455;00:11:51,725;find him some decent clothes.

173;00:11:52,860;00:11:54,928;I'll come visit you soon.

174;00:12:02,604;00:12:04,438;What do you mean

174;00:12:02,604;00:12:04,438;to do with him?

175;00:12:04,473;00:12:06,107;You know what I mean

175;00:12:04,473;00:12:06,107;to do with him.

176;00:12:06,141;00:12:08,275;Then why bathe him

176;00:12:06,141;00:12:08,275;and dress him in fine clothes?

177;00:12:08,310;00:12:10,978;If it needs to be done, do it.

177;00:12:08,310;00:12:10,978;Don't torture the boy.

178;00:12:11,013;00:12:13,314;Have you ever slaughtered

178;00:12:11,013;00:12:13,314;a lamb, my king?

179;00:12:13,348;00:12:15,182;No.

180;00:12:15,216;00:12:18,285;If the lamb sees the knife,

181;00:12:18,320;00:12:20,387;she panics.

182;00:12:20,422;00:12:22,556;Her panic seeps into her meat,

183;00:12:22,590;00:12:24,825;darkens it, fouls the flavor.

184;00:12:24,859;00:12:27,227;You've slaughtered many lambs?

185;00:12:27,261;00:12:30,330;And none have seen the blade.

186;00:12:41,209;00:12:43,510;And tho-- and thowg...

187;00:12:44,545;00:12:47,314;V-v-visenya...

188;00:12:47,349;00:12:49,316;Targaryen...

189;00:12:49,350;00:12:52,453;rod-- rode

190;00:12:52,487;00:12:55,289;Vhagar--

191;00:12:55,323;00:12:57,524;Vhag--

192;00:12:58,927;00:13:01,027;Fuck me.

193;00:13:02,997;00:13:06,732;Visenya Targaryen

194;00:13:06,767;00:13:09,101;rode Vhagar,

195;00:13:09,136;00:13:13,839;the smallest of the dragons,

196;00:13:13,873;00:13:16,007;though still...

197;00:13:16,042;00:13:19,377;large enog--

198;00:13:19,411;00:13:21,879;enough-- enough

199;00:13:21,913;00:13:25,917;to swallow

199;00:13:21,913;00:13:25,917;a horse whole.

200;00:13:38,664;00:13:41,032;Your Grace.

201;00:13:41,067;00:13:42,934;They feeding you enough?

202;00:13:42,969;00:13:44,703;Two meals a day.

203;00:13:44,737;00:13:47,038;Cold for breakfast,

203;00:13:44,737;00:13:47,038;hot for supper.

204;00:13:47,073;00:13:48,873;I cannot complain.

205;00:13:50,076;00:13:52,110;You don't belong

205;00:13:50,076;00:13:52,110;in a place like this.

206;00:13:52,144;00:13:55,246;Well, it's sad to say,

206;00:13:52,144;00:13:55,246;but I've seen worse.

207;00:13:56,448;00:13:57,882;Yeah.

208;00:14:00,953;00:14:03,021;I'm sorry about your son.

209;00:14:04,257;00:14:06,358;Didn't get the chance

209;00:14:04,257;00:14:06,358;to tell you before.

210;00:14:06,392;00:14:09,595;Good lad.

210;00:14:06,392;00:14:09,595;Loyal lad.

211;00:14:12,999;00:14:15,868;Melisandre's returned.

212;00:14:15,903;00:14:18,171;I didn't know she'd been gone.

213;00:14:18,206;00:14:20,340;Came back with a bastard boy.

214;00:14:22,109;00:14:23,844;Robert's bastard boy.

215;00:14:23,878;00:14:25,712;Why?

216;00:14:25,746;00:14:28,548;She says there's power

216;00:14:25,746;00:14:28,548;in king's blood.

217;00:14:28,582;00:14:31,651;She's going to kill him.

218;00:14:31,686;00:14:33,019;Sacrifice him.

219;00:14:33,054;00:14:34,588;Forgive me, Your Grace,

219;00:14:33,054;00:14:34,588;I'm not a learned man,

220;00:14:34,622;00:14:37,857;but is there a difference

220;00:14:34,622;00:14:37,857;between kill and sacrifice?

221;00:14:37,892;00:14:39,626;The boy is your nephew.

222;00:14:39,660;00:14:42,128;What of it?

222;00:14:39,660;00:14:42,128;We're at war.

223;00:14:42,163;00:14:45,065;Why should I spare the son

223;00:14:42,163;00:14:45,065;of some tavern slut

224;00:14:45,099;00:14:48,068;Robert bedded

224;00:14:45,099;00:14:48,068;one drunken night?

225;00:14:48,102;00:14:50,104;Because he has

225;00:14:48,102;00:14:50,104;your blood in his veins.

226;00:14:52,608;00:14:55,043;So did Renly.

227;00:14:55,077;00:14:57,312;Renly wronged you.

228;00:14:57,346;00:15:00,082;Renly declared himself king when

228;00:14:57,346;00:15:00,082;the throne belonged to you.

229;00:15:00,116;00:15:02,584;He raised an army,

229;00:15:00,116;00:15:02,584;stole your bannermen.

230;00:15:02,619;00:15:04,787;This boy has done you no harm.

231;00:15:04,821;00:15:07,490;He's an innocent.

231;00:15:04,821;00:15:07,490;How many boys live in Westeros?

232;00:15:07,524;00:15:11,094;How many girls? How many men?

232;00:15:07,524;00:15:11,094;How many women?

233;00:15:11,128;00:15:13,362;The darkness will devour

233;00:15:11,128;00:15:13,362;them all, she says.

234;00:15:13,397;00:15:15,298;The night that never ends.

235;00:15:15,333;00:15:17,267;Unless I triumph.

236;00:15:17,301;00:15:18,802;I never asked for this.

237;00:15:18,836;00:15:20,537;No more than I asked

237;00:15:18,836;00:15:20,537;to be king.

238;00:15:20,571;00:15:23,941;We do not choose our destiny,

239;00:15:23,975;00:15:26,510;but we must do our duty, no?

240;00:15:26,544;00:15:29,279;Great or small,

240;00:15:26,544;00:15:29,279;we must do our duty.

241;00:15:30,982;00:15:34,618;What's one bastard boy

241;00:15:30,982;00:15:34,618;against a kingdom?

242;00:15:37,756;00:15:39,957;Your Grace,

243;00:15:39,991;00:15:42,092;why did you come

243;00:15:39,991;00:15:42,092;to see me today?

244;00:15:42,126;00:15:44,861;I came to free you.

245;00:15:44,896;00:15:48,565;If you swear never to raise your

245;00:15:44,896;00:15:48,565;hand to the Lady Melisandre again.

246;00:15:48,600;00:15:51,767;I swear it.

247;00:15:51,802;00:15:54,070;I can't swear never

247;00:15:51,802;00:15:54,070;to speak against her.

248;00:15:54,104;00:15:56,139;You have little regard

248;00:15:54,104;00:15:56,139;for your own life.

249;00:15:56,173;00:15:58,241;Quite little, Your Grace.

250;00:15:58,276;00:16:00,643;Verging on none.

251;00:16:00,677;00:16:04,480;You could have freed me

251;00:16:00,677;00:16:04,480;yesterday or tomorrow,

252;00:16:04,515;00:16:07,150;but you came to me now before

252;00:16:04,515;00:16:07,150;this boy is put to the knife

253;00:16:07,184;00:16:10,987;because you knew

253;00:16:07,184;00:16:10,987;I'd counsel restraint.

254;00:16:12,556;00:16:15,324;You came to hear me say it

254;00:16:12,556;00:16:15,324;because you believe it yourself.

255;00:16:15,359;00:16:17,793;You're not a man

255;00:16:15,359;00:16:17,793;who slaughters innocents

256;00:16:17,828;00:16:20,229;for gain or glory.

257;00:16:24,201;00:16:27,270;When my son was five

257;00:16:24,201;00:16:27,270;he said to me,

258;00:16:27,304;00:16:29,772;I don't ever

258;00:16:27,304;00:16:29,772;want to die.

259;00:16:29,806;00:16:33,108;I wanted to say to him, You won't, child.

259;00:16:29,806;00:16:33,108;You won't ever.

260;00:16:33,142;00:16:38,079;I hated the idea of him lying

260;00:16:33,142;00:16:38,079;awake in the dark, afraid.

261;00:16:41,784;00:16:43,785;I think mothers and fathers

261;00:16:41,784;00:16:43,785;made up the gods

262;00:16:43,819;00:16:46,988;because they wanted their children

262;00:16:43,819;00:16:46,988;to sleep through the night.

263;00:16:48,490;00:16:51,025;I saw a vision in the flames.

264;00:16:53,595;00:16:56,130;A great battle in the snow.

265;00:16:56,165;00:16:57,966;I saw it.

266;00:17:00,670;00:17:04,172;And you saw whatever

266;00:17:00,670;00:17:04,172;she gave birth to.

267;00:17:04,207;00:17:08,010;I never believed,

267;00:17:04,207;00:17:08,010;but when you see the truth,

268;00:17:08,044;00:17:10,579;when it's right there

268;00:17:08,044;00:17:10,579;in front of you

269;00:17:10,613;00:17:13,181;as real as these iron bars,

270;00:17:13,216;00:17:16,251;how can you deny

270;00:17:13,216;00:17:16,251;her god is real?

271;00:17:37,507;00:17:39,742;Little dragon bitch.

271;00:17:37,507;00:17:39,742;She talks too much.

272;00:17:39,776;00:17:41,477;You talk too much.

273;00:17:41,511;00:17:44,080;She won't talk so much

273;00:17:41,511;00:17:44,080;when she's choking on my cock.

274;00:17:44,114;00:17:46,782;8,000 Unsullied stand

274;00:17:44,114;00:17:46,782;between her and your cock.

275;00:17:46,817;00:17:49,585;My cock will find a way.

276;00:17:49,620;00:17:52,655;Tell him. Is there any place

276;00:17:49,620;00:17:52,655;that my cock can't reach?

277;00:17:52,689;00:17:55,291;She'll tell me whatever

277;00:17:52,689;00:17:55,291;you pay her to tell me.

278;00:17:55,325;00:17:58,627;Daario Naharis, the whore

278;00:17:55,325;00:17:58,627;who doesn't like whores.

279;00:17:58,662;00:18:01,697;I like them very much.

279;00:17:58,662;00:18:01,697;I just refuse to pay them.

280;00:18:01,731;00:18:04,700;And I'm no whore, my friend.

281;00:18:04,735;00:18:07,036;She sells her sheath

281;00:18:04,735;00:18:07,036;and you sell your blade.

282;00:18:07,070;00:18:09,538;What's the difference?

282;00:18:07,070;00:18:09,538;I fight for beauty.

283;00:18:09,573;00:18:11,073;For beauty?

284;00:18:11,107;00:18:12,674;We fight for gold.

285;00:18:12,709;00:18:17,046;The gods gave men two gifts to

285;00:18:12,709;00:18:17,046;entertain ourselves before we die--

286;00:18:17,080;00:18:19,982;the thrill of fucking a woman

286;00:18:17,080;00:18:19,982;who wants to be fucked

287;00:18:20,016;00:18:23,352;and the thrill of killing

287;00:18:20,016;00:18:23,352;a man who wants to kill you.

288;00:18:23,386;00:18:24,887;You'll die young.

289;00:18:24,921;00:18:26,488;What do we do

289;00:18:24,921;00:18:26,488;about the dragon girl?

290;00:18:26,523;00:18:29,358;We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied

290;00:18:26,523;00:18:29,358;on the battlefield.

291;00:18:29,392;00:18:32,094;There won't be a battle. And we don't

291;00:18:29,392;00:18:32,094;have to deal with her eunuchs.

292;00:18:32,128;00:18:33,629;We only have to deal with her.

293;00:18:33,663;00:18:36,231;She's well guarded.

293;00:18:33,663;00:18:36,231;- Tonight's a new moon.

294;00:18:36,266;00:18:39,868;One of us slips into her camp past

294;00:18:36,266;00:18:39,868;her Unsullied and her knights.

295;00:18:41,237;00:18:43,539;Which one of us?

296;00:18:45,175;00:18:46,508;Close your eyes, love.

297;00:18:53,049;00:18:55,083;Three coins.

298;00:18:55,118;00:18:56,985;A coin from Meereen,

299;00:18:57,020;00:18:59,254;a coin from Volantis,

300;00:18:59,288;00:19:00,856;and a coin from Braavos.

301;00:19:00,890;00:19:02,557;The Braavosi does the deed.

302;00:19:07,096;00:19:09,130;One for each of us, darling.

303;00:19:10,233;00:19:12,033;No peeking.

304;00:19:27,249;00:19:29,584;Do you hear me?

305;00:19:29,618;00:19:33,120;Follow my voice.

305;00:19:29,618;00:19:33,120;I'm right here.

306;00:19:34,256;00:19:36,490;You have something for me?

307;00:19:40,595;00:19:42,897;Valar morghulis.

308;00:20:04,887;00:20:06,654;Lady Sansa.

309;00:20:08,090;00:20:10,058;You look very handsome,

309;00:20:08,090;00:20:10,058;my lord.

310;00:20:10,092;00:20:11,659;Oh, yes.

311;00:20:11,693;00:20:14,095;The husband of your dreams.

312;00:20:14,129;00:20:16,764;But you do look glorious.

313;00:20:21,770;00:20:23,771;Perhaps we could have

313;00:20:21,770;00:20:23,771;a moment alone.

314;00:20:23,805;00:20:25,440;Do you mind?

315;00:20:27,009;00:20:30,645;Podrick, could you escort

315;00:20:27,009;00:20:30,645;Lady Stark's handmaiden?

316;00:20:46,197;00:20:48,165;My lady,

317;00:20:48,200;00:20:50,734;I want you to know

318;00:20:50,768;00:20:53,103;I didn't ask for this.

319;00:20:53,137;00:20:55,839;I hope I will not

319;00:20:53,137;00:20:55,839;disappoint you, my lord.

320;00:20:55,873;00:20:57,574;No, don't.

321;00:20:57,608;00:21:00,544;You don't have to speak to me

321;00:20:57,608;00:21:00,544;as a prisoner anymore.

322;00:21:00,578;00:21:02,579;You won't be a prisoner

322;00:21:00,578;00:21:02,579;after today.

323;00:21:02,614;00:21:04,682;You'll be my wife.

324;00:21:04,717;00:21:09,087;I suppose that's a

324;00:21:04,717;00:21:09,087;different kind of prison.

325;00:21:10,857;00:21:12,758;I just wanted to say--

326;00:21:12,793;00:21:16,429;I'm just trying

326;00:21:12,793;00:21:16,429;to say very badly--

327;00:21:17,965;00:21:20,333;I just--

328;00:21:20,367;00:21:23,168;just want to say

328;00:21:20,367;00:21:23,168;I know how you feel.

329;00:21:25,204;00:21:28,406;I doubt that

329;00:21:25,204;00:21:28,406;very much, my lord.

330;00:21:30,376;00:21:31,876;You're right.

331;00:21:31,910;00:21:34,245;I have no idea how you feel.

332;00:21:34,279;00:21:36,547;And you have no idea

332;00:21:34,279;00:21:36,547;how I feel.

333;00:21:43,688;00:21:46,623;But I promise you

333;00:21:43,688;00:21:46,623;one thing, my lady.

334;00:21:47,926;00:21:50,327;I won't ever hurt you.

335;00:21:54,199;00:21:56,733;Do you drink wine?

336;00:21:56,768;00:21:59,303;When I have to.

337;00:21:59,337;00:22:02,573;Well, today you have to.

338;00:22:09,581;00:22:11,849;You look radiant, Your Grace.

339;00:22:11,883;00:22:14,485;Radiant?

339;00:22:11,883;00:22:14,485;Why radiant?

340;00:22:14,519;00:22:16,354;It's the word

340;00:22:14,519;00:22:16,354;that came to mind.

341;00:22:18,424;00:22:20,425;We're going to be sisters soon.

342;00:22:20,459;00:22:22,861;We should be friends.

343;00:22:22,895;00:22:25,430;You're a musical girl,

343;00:22:22,895;00:22:25,430;aren't you?

344;00:22:25,465;00:22:28,300;I imagine you have

344;00:22:25,465;00:22:28,300;a lovely voice.

345;00:22:28,334;00:22:31,270;A better dancer than a

345;00:22:28,334;00:22:31,270;singer, I'm afraid.

346;00:22:31,304;00:22:33,872;Ah, but you know the song

346;00:22:31,304;00:22:33,872;The Rains of Castamere?

347;00:22:33,907;00:22:37,410;Of course. They play it

347;00:22:33,907;00:22:37,410;so often here at court.

348;00:22:37,444;00:22:40,413;So you know the story

348;00:22:37,444;00:22:40,413;of House Reyne of Castamere?

349;00:22:40,447;00:22:42,915;Not as well as you, I'm sure.

350;00:22:42,949;00:22:45,083;House Reyne

350;00:22:42,949;00:22:45,083;was a powerful family.

351;00:22:45,118;00:22:46,518;Very wealthy.

352;00:22:46,552;00:22:49,087;The second wealthiest

352;00:22:46,552;00:22:49,087;in Westeros.

353;00:22:49,121;00:22:53,491;Aren't the Tyrells the second

353;00:22:49,121;00:22:53,491;wealthiest family in Westeros now?

354;00:22:53,526;00:22:55,960;Of course, ambitious

354;00:22:53,526;00:22:55,960;climbers don't want to stop

355;00:22:55,994;00:22:58,295;on the second highest rung.

356;00:22:58,329;00:23:01,164;If only you could take

356;00:22:58,329;00:23:01,164;that final step,

357;00:23:01,199;00:23:04,067;you'd see further

357;00:23:01,199;00:23:04,067;than all the rest.

358;00:23:04,102;00:23:07,070;You'd be alone with nothing

358;00:23:04,102;00:23:07,070;but blue sky above you.

359;00:23:08,072;00:23:10,040;So Lord Reyne built a castle

360;00:23:10,074;00:23:12,042;as grand as Casterly Rock.

361;00:23:12,076;00:23:13,644;He gave his wife diamonds

362;00:23:13,678;00:23:16,213;larger than any

362;00:23:13,678;00:23:16,213;my mother ever wore.

363;00:23:16,248;00:23:18,582;And finally one day,

364;00:23:18,617;00:23:20,951;he rebelled against my father.

365;00:23:20,986;00:23:23,654;Do you know where

365;00:23:20,986;00:23:23,654;House Reyne is now?

366;00:23:23,689;00:23:25,222;Gone.

367;00:23:25,257;00:23:27,524;Gone.

368;00:23:27,559;00:23:29,794;A gentle word.

369;00:23:29,828;00:23:32,329;Why not say slaughtered?

370;00:23:32,364;00:23:35,232;Every man, woman, and child

371;00:23:35,267;00:23:37,735;put to the sword.

372;00:23:37,769;00:23:39,804;I remember seeing

372;00:23:37,769;00:23:39,804;their bodies hanging

373;00:23:39,838;00:23:42,473;high above the gates

373;00:23:39,838;00:23:42,473;of Casterly Rock.

374;00:23:42,507;00:23:45,410;My father let them rot

374;00:23:42,507;00:23:45,410;up there all summer.

375;00:23:45,444;00:23:47,845;It was a long summer.

376;00:23:47,879;00:23:51,515;And now the rains

376;00:23:47,879;00:23:51,515;weep o'er their halls,

377;00:23:51,549;00:23:53,617;and not a soul to hear.

378;00:23:59,223;00:24:00,824;If you ever

378;00:23:59,223;00:24:00,824;call me sister again,

379;00:24:00,858;00:24:03,493;I'll have you strangled

379;00:24:00,858;00:24:03,493;in your sleep.

380;00:24:34,459;00:24:36,926;What are you doing?

381;00:24:36,961;00:24:38,695;Your father's gone.

382;00:24:38,729;00:24:41,831;As the father of the realm,

383;00:24:41,866;00:24:45,268;it is my duty to give you

383;00:24:41,866;00:24:45,268;away to your husband.

384;00:26:07,921;00:26:09,789;You may now cloak the bride

385;00:26:09,824;00:26:12,892;and bring her

385;00:26:09,824;00:26:12,892;under your protection.

386;00:26:41,791;00:26:43,925;Could you...

387;00:26:50,200;00:26:51,834;Thank you.

388;00:26:57,441;00:26:59,810;Your Grace, Your Grace,

389;00:26:59,844;00:27:02,412;my lords, my ladies,

390;00:27:02,447;00:27:05,616;we stand here in the sight

390;00:27:02,447;00:27:05,616;of gods and men

391;00:27:05,650;00:27:09,052;to witness the union

391;00:27:05,650;00:27:09,052;of man and wife.

392;00:27:09,087;00:27:12,956;One flesh, one heart, one soul,

393;00:27:12,991;00:27:15,893;now and forever.

394;00:27:32,776;00:27:35,210;Have you ever seen one like it?

395;00:27:35,244;00:27:38,179;I've never seen anything

395;00:27:35,244;00:27:38,179;like any of this.

396;00:27:38,213;00:27:39,880;Not in my life.

397;00:27:39,915;00:27:41,649;It's shocking, isn't it,

398;00:27:41,683;00:27:43,751;the first time

398;00:27:41,683;00:27:43,751;you encounter real wealth?

399;00:27:43,785;00:27:47,721;When I was your age, I lived

399;00:27:43,785;00:27:47,721;on one bowl of stew a day.

400;00:27:47,756;00:27:50,658;And stew is a kind word for it.

401;00:27:52,027;00:27:54,529;In Flea Bottom we called

401;00:27:52,027;00:27:54,529;them bowls of brown.

402;00:27:56,098;00:27:58,633;We'd pretend that the meat

402;00:27:56,098;00:27:58,633;in them was chicken.

403;00:27:59,735;00:28:01,770;We knew it wasn't chicken.

404;00:28:13,584;00:28:16,519;Here, taste this.

405;00:28:16,554;00:28:19,089;You think I'm trying

405;00:28:16,554;00:28:19,089;to poison you?

406;00:28:41,309;00:28:42,777;That's good.

407;00:28:46,348;00:28:47,982;That's really good.

408;00:28:48,016;00:28:50,317;Where do you think it's from?

409;00:28:50,352;00:28:52,086;I couldn't even guess.

410;00:28:52,120;00:28:53,854;Doesn't matter, does it?

411;00:28:53,889;00:28:56,057;It's the real thing

411;00:28:53,889;00:28:56,057;or it's not.

412;00:28:56,091;00:28:59,260;You only need a tongue

412;00:28:56,091;00:28:59,260;to tell the difference.

413;00:29:01,430;00:29:03,631;Go on, have some more.

414;00:29:08,403;00:29:10,571;You still don't trust it.

415;00:29:10,605;00:29:12,173;You think this is all a mistake

416;00:29:12,207;00:29:14,909;and that you'll have to pay

416;00:29:12,207;00:29:14,909;somehow for every bite you take.

417;00:29:14,943;00:29:17,278;That thought had

417;00:29:14,943;00:29:17,278;crossed my mind, yeah.

418;00:29:19,081;00:29:21,415;There are no mistakes.

419;00:29:21,450;00:29:23,384;Not for us.

420;00:29:24,553;00:29:26,987;I'm a mistake.

421;00:29:27,022;00:29:29,223;I'm only here because

421;00:29:27,022;00:29:29,223;my father grabbed my mother

422;00:29:29,257;00:29:31,191;instead of the girl

422;00:29:29,257;00:29:31,191;next to her in the tavern.

423;00:29:31,226;00:29:34,928;Your father chose your mother because

423;00:29:31,226;00:29:34,928;the Lord of Light willed it.

424;00:29:34,962;00:29:37,731;He willed it so you

424;00:29:34,962;00:29:37,731;could be here right now

425;00:29:37,765;00:29:39,999;with a power inside you

426;00:29:40,034;00:29:43,035;you can't even begin

426;00:29:40,034;00:29:43,035;to understand.

427;00:29:45,339;00:29:48,141;And He brought me here

427;00:29:45,339;00:29:48,141;to draw it from you

428;00:29:48,176;00:29:50,143;and birth it into the world.

429;00:29:53,114;00:29:55,381;We're both a part of His plan.

430;00:29:56,383;00:29:58,050;He wants this for us.

431;00:29:58,085;00:30:00,920;No, He demands this of us.

432;00:30:04,725;00:30:07,260;I don't understand.

432;00:30:04,725;00:30:07,260;This--

433;00:30:07,294;00:30:09,095;this doesn't seem

433;00:30:07,294;00:30:09,095;very religious.

434;00:30:09,129;00:30:11,597;According to whom?

435;00:30:13,199;00:30:15,067;The Silent Sisters?

436;00:30:15,101;00:30:17,035;With their stern looks,

437;00:30:17,070;00:30:20,372;muzzled mouths,

437;00:30:17,070;00:30:20,372;and dried-up cunts?

438;00:30:21,841;00:30:24,342;What have their gods

438;00:30:21,841;00:30:24,342;done for you?

439;00:30:24,377;00:30:26,377;Hmm?

440;00:30:26,412;00:30:28,146;When you pray to them,

441;00:30:28,180;00:30:30,414;what's their answer?

442;00:30:30,449;00:30:33,017;A god is real or he's not.

443;00:30:34,252;00:30:36,887;You only need eyes to see.

444;00:30:41,258;00:30:44,561;Death is coming

444;00:30:41,258;00:30:44,561;for everyone and everything.

445;00:30:44,595;00:30:47,564;A darkness that will

445;00:30:44,595;00:30:47,564;swallow the dawn.

446;00:30:48,633;00:30:52,436;And we can stop it, you and I.

447;00:31:19,164;00:31:22,733;Let me show you

447;00:31:19,164;00:31:22,733;what you have inside you.

448;00:31:22,768;00:31:24,802;Come fight death with me.

449;00:31:54,468;00:31:56,235;What are you doing?

450;00:31:59,306;00:32:01,340;You have to trust me.

451;00:32:24,430;00:32:26,065;What--?

452;00:32:26,099;00:32:28,501;Get it away.

453;00:32:28,535;00:32:29,902;Get it off me.

454;00:32:29,937;00:32:32,705;Don't fight, don't fight.

454;00:32:29,937;00:32:32,705;They won't take much.

455;00:32:33,774;00:32:35,742;Why are you doing this?

456;00:32:36,978;00:32:39,746;I told you there's power

456;00:32:36,978;00:32:39,746;in the blood of kings.

457;00:32:39,781;00:32:41,749;And you have so much blood.

458;00:32:41,783;00:32:44,818;No. No, no, no, no!

459;00:32:46,621;00:32:49,023;Not there.

459;00:32:46,621;00:32:49,023;Not there!

460;00:32:54,262;00:32:56,663;You can blame Ser Davos.

461;00:32:56,698;00:32:59,332;He didn't believe in

461;00:32:56,698;00:32:59,332;the power of king's blood.

462;00:33:01,335;00:33:03,603;He wanted a demonstration.

463;00:33:03,638;00:33:06,807;Please.

463;00:33:03,638;00:33:06,807;Please, Your Grace.

464;00:33:06,841;00:33:09,310;My lord!

465;00:33:44,945;00:33:47,413;The usurper Robb Stark.

466;00:33:50,617;00:33:53,119;The usurper Balon Greyjoy.

467;00:33:57,325;00:33:59,826;The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

468;00:34:17,510;00:34:21,646;So their son

468;00:34:17,510;00:34:21,646;will be your nephew.

469;00:34:21,680;00:34:24,282;After you're wed

469;00:34:21,680;00:34:24,282;to Cersei, of course.

470;00:34:25,518;00:34:28,621;And you will be

470;00:34:25,518;00:34:28,621;the king's stepfather

471;00:34:28,655;00:34:30,957;and brother-in-law.

472;00:34:30,991;00:34:32,858;When you marry the king,

473;00:34:32,893;00:34:36,762;Joffrey's mother will

473;00:34:32,893;00:34:36,762;become his sister-in-law

474;00:34:36,797;00:34:40,866;and your son

474;00:34:36,797;00:34:40,866;will be Loras' nephew?

475;00:34:40,901;00:34:44,636;Grandson?

475;00:34:40,901;00:34:44,636;I'm not sure.

476;00:34:44,671;00:34:47,206;But your brother will become

476;00:34:44,671;00:34:47,206;your father-in-law.

477;00:34:47,241;00:34:49,475;That much is beyond dispute.

478;00:35:10,162;00:35:12,497;Will you pardon me, my lord?

479;00:35:13,599;00:35:16,234;Of course. Of course.

479;00:35:13,599;00:35:16,234;En-- enjoy.

480;00:35:20,038;00:35:23,874;Perhaps you could talk

480;00:35:20,038;00:35:23,874;to your bride-to-be instead.

481;00:35:26,811;00:35:29,012;I've got a lifetime for that.

482;00:35:40,358;00:35:42,226;Stay.

483;00:35:50,635;00:35:53,070;You seem rather drunk.

484;00:35:53,105;00:35:55,907;Rather less than I plan to be.

485;00:35:55,941;00:35:58,810;Isn't it a man's duty to be

485;00:35:55,941;00:35:58,810;drunk at his own wedding?

486;00:35:58,844;00:36:00,411;This isn't about your wedding.

487;00:36:00,446;00:36:02,747;Renly Baratheon had a wedding.

488;00:36:02,781;00:36:05,050;Your wife needs a child,

489;00:36:05,084;00:36:08,086;a Lannister child,

489;00:36:05,084;00:36:08,086;as soon as possible.

490;00:36:08,121;00:36:10,923;And?

490;00:36:08,121;00:36:10,923;If you're going to give her one,

491;00:36:10,957;00:36:12,958;you need to perform.

492;00:36:12,992;00:36:15,861;What did you once call me?

493;00:36:15,896;00:36:18,364;A drunken little

493;00:36:15,896;00:36:18,364;lust-filled beast.

494;00:36:18,398;00:36:20,967;More than once.

494;00:36:18,398;00:36:20,967;There you have it.

495;00:36:21,001;00:36:23,069;Nothing to worry about.

496;00:36:23,103;00:36:25,404;Drinking and lust,

497;00:36:25,439;00:36:28,073;no man can match me

497;00:36:25,439;00:36:28,073;in these things.

498;00:36:28,108;00:36:31,376;I am the god of tits and wine.

499;00:36:31,411;00:36:34,846;I shall build

499;00:36:31,411;00:36:34,846;a shrine to myself

500;00:36:34,880;00:36:36,781;at the next brothel I visit.

501;00:36:37,123;00:36:40,218;You can drink, you can joke,

502;00:36:40,252;00:36:42,653;you can engage

502;00:36:40,252;00:36:42,653;in juvenile attempts

503;00:36:42,687;00:36:44,455;to make your father

503;00:36:42,687;00:36:44,455;uncomfortable,

504;00:36:44,489;00:36:47,291;but you will do your duty.

505;00:37:26,500;00:37:27,833;Well...

506;00:37:32,706;00:37:33,807;My father once told me--

507;00:37:33,841;00:37:37,077;Nobody cares what

507;00:37:33,841;00:37:37,077;your father once told you.

508;00:37:59,135;00:38:01,670;Congratulations, my lady.

509;00:38:01,704;00:38:03,138;Thank you, Your Grace.

510;00:38:03,172;00:38:05,774;Well, you've done it.

510;00:38:03,172;00:38:05,774;You've married a Lannister.

511;00:38:05,808;00:38:07,709;Soon you'll have

511;00:38:05,808;00:38:07,709;a Lannister baby.

512;00:38:07,744;00:38:10,946;It's a dream come true

512;00:38:07,744;00:38:10,946;for you, isn't it?

513;00:38:10,980;00:38:12,848;What a glorious day.

514;00:38:12,882;00:38:14,349;Yes, Your Grace.

515;00:38:14,384;00:38:16,785;I suppose it doesn't

515;00:38:14,384;00:38:16,785;really matter

516;00:38:16,819;00:38:19,321;which Lannister

516;00:38:16,819;00:38:19,321;puts the baby into you.

517;00:38:20,456;00:38:22,424;Maybe I'll pay you

517;00:38:20,456;00:38:22,424;a visit tonight

518;00:38:22,458;00:38:24,893;after my uncle passes out.

519;00:38:24,927;00:38:26,795;How'd you like that?

520;00:38:29,131;00:38:30,866;You wouldn't?

521;00:38:30,900;00:38:33,902;That's all right. Ser Meryn and

521;00:38:30,900;00:38:33,902;Ser Boros will hold you down.

522;00:38:38,175;00:38:40,209;Time for the bedding ceremony.

523;00:38:41,478;00:38:43,246;There will be

523;00:38:41,478;00:38:43,246;no bedding ceremony.

524;00:38:43,280;00:38:46,081;Where's your respect

524;00:38:43,280;00:38:46,081;for tradition, Uncle?

525;00:38:46,116;00:38:47,616;Come, everyone.

526;00:38:47,651;00:38:49,919;Pick her up and carry her

526;00:38:47,651;00:38:49,919;to her wedding bed.

527;00:38:49,954;00:38:53,689;Get rid of her gown. She won't

527;00:38:49,954;00:38:53,689;be needing it any longer.

528;00:38:53,724;00:38:56,626;Ladies, attend to my uncle.

528;00:38:53,724;00:38:56,626;He's not heavy.

529;00:38:56,660;00:38:58,494;There will be

529;00:38:56,660;00:38:58,494;no bedding ceremony.

530;00:38:58,528;00:39:01,731;There will be if I command it.

531;00:39:03,534;00:39:06,470;Then you'll be fucking

531;00:39:03,534;00:39:06,470;your own bride

532;00:39:06,504;00:39:09,607;with a wooden cock.

533;00:39:11,242;00:39:13,577;What did you say?

534;00:39:17,115;00:39:21,819;What did you say?!

535;00:39:21,853;00:39:25,489;I believe we can dispense

535;00:39:21,853;00:39:25,489;with the bedding, Your Grace.

536;00:39:26,891;00:39:29,993;I'm sure Tyrion did not mean

536;00:39:26,891;00:39:29,993;to threaten the king.

537;00:39:37,701;00:39:40,035;A bad joke, Your Grace.

538;00:39:40,070;00:39:43,639;Made out of envy

538;00:39:40,070;00:39:43,639;of your own royal manhood.

539;00:39:45,075;00:39:47,543;Mine is so small.

540;00:39:47,577;00:39:50,413;My poor wife won't

540;00:39:47,577;00:39:50,413;even know I'm there.

541;00:39:50,447;00:39:53,783;Your uncle is clearly

541;00:39:50,447;00:39:53,783;quite drunk, Your Grace.

542;00:39:53,817;00:39:56,219;I am.

543;00:39:56,253;00:39:58,454;Guilty.

544;00:39:59,556;00:40:01,357;But--

545;00:40:03,193;00:40:05,294;but it is my wedding night.

546;00:40:05,329;00:40:09,499;My tiny drunk cock

546;00:40:05,329;00:40:09,499;and I have a job to do.

547;00:40:12,269;00:40:13,936;Come, wife.

548;00:40:17,474;00:40:19,775;I vomited on a girl once

549;00:40:19,809;00:40:21,277;in the middle of the act.

550;00:40:21,311;00:40:22,945;Not proud of it.

551;00:40:22,980;00:40:25,882;But I think honesty

551;00:40:22,980;00:40:25,882;is important

552;00:40:25,917;00:40:28,452;between a man and wife,

552;00:40:25,917;00:40:28,452;don't you agree?

553;00:40:28,486;00:40:30,955;Come, I'll tell you

553;00:40:28,486;00:40:30,955;all about it.

554;00:40:30,989;00:40:33,024;Put you in the mood.

555;00:41:05,391;00:41:07,225;Is that wise, my lord?

556;00:41:07,259;00:41:10,027;Tyrion, Sansa.

557;00:41:10,062;00:41:12,129;My name is Tyrion.

558;00:41:13,164;00:41:15,132;Is that wise, Tyrion?

559;00:41:20,104;00:41:22,372;Nothing was ever wiser.

560;00:41:33,917;00:41:36,785;Astoundingly long.

561;00:41:37,653;00:41:38,853;What?

562;00:41:38,888;00:41:40,655;Neck.

563;00:41:40,689;00:41:42,490;You have one.

564;00:41:45,294;00:41:47,162;How old are you exactly?

565;00:41:47,196;00:41:49,431;14.

566;00:41:52,869;00:41:57,439;Well, talk won't

566;00:41:52,869;00:41:57,439;make you any older.

567;00:42:04,514;00:42:08,184;My lord father has commanded me

568;00:42:08,219;00:42:10,787;to consummate this marriage.

569;00:43:28,870;00:43:31,171;Stop.

570;00:43:32,607;00:43:34,608;I can't.

571;00:43:37,779;00:43:40,214;I could, I won't.

572;00:43:40,249;00:43:41,649;But your father--

573;00:43:41,683;00:43:44,251;If my father wants

573;00:43:41,683;00:43:44,251;someone to get fucked,

574;00:43:44,285;00:43:46,486;I know where he can start.

575;00:43:51,658;00:43:53,559;I won't share your bed.

576;00:43:56,863;00:43:59,231;Not until you want me to.

577;00:44:01,668;00:44:04,570;What if I never want you to?

578;00:44:15,249;00:44:17,750;And so my watch begins.

579;00:45:11,905;00:45:13,338;19?

580;00:45:13,373;00:45:14,640;Yes, Your Grace.

581;00:45:14,674;00:45:17,609;How can anyone

581;00:45:14,674;00:45:17,609;speak 19 languages?

582;00:45:17,644;00:45:20,979;It only took Your Grace a year to

582;00:45:17,644;00:45:20,979;learn Dothraki reasonably well.

583;00:45:21,014;00:45:23,215;Yes, well, it was

583;00:45:21,014;00:45:23,215;either learn Dothraki

584;00:45:23,249;00:45:26,285;or grunt at my husband

584;00:45:23,249;00:45:26,285;and hope--

585;00:45:27,654;00:45:29,856;what do you mean

585;00:45:27,654;00:45:29,856;reasonably well?

586;00:45:31,292;00:45:34,261;Dothraki is difficult

586;00:45:31,292;00:45:34,261;for the mouth to master.

587;00:45:34,295;00:45:36,396;So guttural and harsh.

588;00:45:36,431;00:45:40,036;_

589;00:45:40,156;00:45:41,874;_

590;00:45:45,006;00:45:47,907;Athjahakar.

591;00:45:47,942;00:45:50,477;Athjahaka.

592;00:45:50,511;00:45:52,912;Ath-ja-hakar.

593;00:45:52,947;00:45:55,614;Athjahakar.

594;00:45:56,816;00:46:00,419;Well, I suppose

594;00:45:56,816;00:46:00,419;I'm a bit out of practice.

595;00:46:00,453;00:46:03,722;Your High Valyrian

595;00:46:00,453;00:46:03,722;is very good, Your Grace.

596;00:46:03,757;00:46:07,192;The gods could not devise

596;00:46:03,757;00:46:07,192;a more perfect tongue.

597;00:46:07,227;00:46:10,129;It is the only proper

597;00:46:07,227;00:46:10,129;language for poetry.

598;00:46:15,702;00:46:18,504;No screaming or she dies.

599;00:46:31,919;00:46:33,219;What do you want?

600;00:46:34,721;00:46:36,289;You.

601;00:46:36,323;00:46:37,857;Let her go.

602;00:46:37,892;00:46:40,126;Don't scream, lovely girl.

603;00:46:47,400;00:46:49,234;You were sent here to kill me?

604;00:46:51,003;00:46:53,104;So why haven't you?

605;00:46:53,139;00:46:54,639;I don't want to.

606;00:46:54,673;00:46:57,641;What do your captains

606;00:46:54,673;00:46:57,641;have to say about that?

607;00:46:57,676;00:46:59,910;You should ask them.

608;00:47:05,249;00:47:06,550;Why?

609;00:47:06,584;00:47:09,319;We had philosophical

609;00:47:06,584;00:47:09,319;differences.

610;00:47:09,354;00:47:11,722;Over what?

610;00:47:09,354;00:47:11,722;Your beauty.

611;00:47:11,756;00:47:14,692;It meant more to me

611;00:47:11,756;00:47:14,692;than it did to them.

612;00:47:14,726;00:47:16,694;You're a strange man.

613;00:47:16,728;00:47:18,729;I'm the simplest man

613;00:47:16,728;00:47:18,729;you'll ever meet.

614;00:47:18,764;00:47:20,264;I only do what I want to do.

615;00:47:20,299;00:47:22,200;And this is supposed

615;00:47:20,299;00:47:22,200;to impress me?

616;00:47:22,234;00:47:24,535;Yes.

617;00:47:26,171;00:47:29,107;Why would I trust a man

617;00:47:26,171;00:47:29,107;who murders his comrades?

618;00:47:29,141;00:47:31,543;They ordered me to murder you.

619;00:47:31,577;00:47:33,745;I told them I preferred not to.

620;00:47:33,779;00:47:36,147;They told me I had no choice.

621;00:47:36,182;00:47:38,250;I told them

621;00:47:36,182;00:47:38,250;I am Daario Naharis.

622;00:47:38,284;00:47:41,119;I always have a choice.

623;00:47:42,322;00:47:45,024;They drew their swords

624;00:47:45,058;00:47:47,159;and I drew mine.

625;00:48:18,290;00:48:20,758;Will you fight for me?

626;00:48:27,100;00:48:29,535;Swear to me.

627;00:48:32,272;00:48:35,275;The Second Sons are yours

627;00:48:32,272;00:48:35,275;and so is Daario Naharis.

628;00:48:35,309;00:48:38,145;My sword is yours,

628;00:48:35,309;00:48:38,145;my life is yours,

629;00:48:38,179;00:48:40,648;my heart is yours.

630;00:48:58,501;00:49:01,269;You really ought to knock.

631;00:49:01,304;00:49:03,572;I brought your breakfast.

632;00:50:21,048;00:50:23,115;It's getting dark.

633;00:50:23,150;00:50:25,317;We could stay here

633;00:50:23,150;00:50:25,317;for the night.

634;00:50:58,455;00:51:00,857;How hard can it be

634;00:50:58,455;00:51:00,857;to build a fire?

635;00:51:00,891;00:51:03,259;It doesn't matter.

636;00:51:03,294;00:51:05,728;Come under the furs.

636;00:51:03,294;00:51:05,728;We can keep each other warm.

637;00:51:25,682;00:51:27,516;He winked at me before.

638;00:51:28,618;00:51:32,354;I doubt it.

638;00:51:28,618;00:51:32,354;I saw him wink at me.

639;00:51:32,388;00:51:34,756;He blinked.

640;00:51:34,790;00:51:37,592;I suppose it's a rather

640;00:51:34,790;00:51:37,592;philosophical difference

641;00:51:37,626;00:51:39,727;between a wink and a blink.

642;00:51:40,595;00:51:42,263;A what?

643;00:51:43,665;00:51:47,902;Well, I mean,

643;00:51:43,665;00:51:47,902;there's no real difference.

644;00:51:50,539;00:51:52,974;A wink is on purpose.

645;00:51:56,012;00:51:57,646;You thought of a name yet?

646;00:52:00,983;00:52:04,520;It would be easier to refer

646;00:52:00,983;00:52:04,520;to him if he had a name.

647;00:52:04,554;00:52:07,723;Sometimes do you talk fancy

647;00:52:04,554;00:52:07,723;on purpose to confuse me?

648;00:52:07,757;00:52:10,426;What? No.

649;00:52:10,460;00:52:13,163;This is just the way I talk.

650;00:52:16,367;00:52:18,502;I'll build that fire.

651;00:52:26,878;00:52:29,279;Don't you think

651;00:52:26,878;00:52:29,279;he should have a name?

652;00:52:30,515;00:52:33,584;I don't know many boys' names.

653;00:52:33,618;00:52:35,185;Let's see,

654;00:52:35,219;00:52:37,354;there's Duncan,

655;00:52:37,388;00:52:40,357;Kevan, Jon...

656;00:52:40,391;00:52:42,292;Guymon,

657;00:52:42,326;00:52:44,560;Feldan, Tristifer.

658;00:52:44,595;00:52:47,296;Craster.

659;00:52:47,330;00:52:49,231;Uh, yes.

660;00:52:50,600;00:52:52,067;Maybe that's not--

661;00:52:52,101;00:52:54,102;Mormont.

662;00:52:54,136;00:52:56,571;That's a lovely idea,

663;00:52:56,605;00:52:58,539;but Mormont's a last name.

664;00:52:58,574;00:53:01,475;Why is it a last name?

665;00:53:01,510;00:53:04,212;Well, it's a family name.

666;00:53:06,081;00:53:08,883;For instance,

666;00:53:06,081;00:53:08,883;I'm Samwell Tarly.

667;00:53:08,917;00:53:11,186;Samwell is my birth name

668;00:53:11,220;00:53:14,589;and Tarly is my family name.

669;00:53:14,624;00:53:19,093;You see? So my father

669;00:53:14,624;00:53:19,093;is also a Tarly.

670;00:53:20,396;00:53:22,697;His name is Samwell Tarly, too?

671;00:53:22,732;00:53:25,634;No, Randyll Tarly.

672;00:53:25,668;00:53:27,703;Randyll is a handsome name.

673;00:53:28,905;00:53:30,740;Please don't name him Randyll.

674;00:53:34,945;00:53:36,879;Is your father cruel like mine?

675;00:53:41,453;00:53:43,854;Different manner of cruel.

676;00:53:56,735;00:53:58,402;Not Randyll, then.

677;00:54:21,493;00:54:23,628;Don't.

678;00:54:23,662;00:54:25,463;Don't go out there.

679;00:54:25,497;00:54:27,431;I'll be back.

680;00:54:27,466;00:54:29,467;I just want to look.

681;00:55:04,769;00:55:06,970;Go inside.

682;00:55:07,004;00:55:09,339;Go back inside.

682;00:55:07,004;00:55:09,339;I'll--

683;00:55:23,088;00:55:25,789;It's come for the baby.

684;00:55:40,972;00:55:42,206;Stay back!

685;00:55:49,647;00:55:51,448;You stay back!

686;00:56:03,419;00:56:06,195;No, you can't

686;00:56:03,419;00:56:06,195;have him! No!

687;00:56:08,565;00:56:10,399;No!
