4;00:03:02,932;00:03:05,133;They were in and out
4;00:03:02,932;00:03:05,133;before anyone spotted them.
5;00:03:05,135;00:03:07,102;Burnt our food stores

7;00:03:09,389;00:03:11,723;Horses?

8;00:03:11,774;00:03:13,892;but hundreds are dead.
9;00:03:13,943;00:03:17,613;20 men rode into our camp without a
9;00:03:13,943;00:03:17,613;single guard sounding the alarm?
10;00:03:17,647;00:03:20,148;The northerners know more about
10;00:03:17,647;00:03:20,148;their land than we ever will.

12;00:03:21,819;00:03:23,535;they conspired with the enemy.
13;00:03:23,569;00:03:27,155;Find out the truth and then hang them.
13;00:03:23,569;00:03:27,155;Your Grace.
14;00:03:27,157;00:03:30,409;Unless there's a thaw, we can't

16;00:03:33,079;00:03:34,913;We're not returning
16;00:03:33,079;00:03:34,913;to Castle Black.
17;00:03:34,964;00:03:38,333;Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed
17;00:03:34,964;00:03:38,333;to be an expert in military matters,
18;00:03:38,384;00:03:41,970;but if we can't march forward
18;00:03:38,384;00:03:41,970;and we won't march back...
19;00:03:55,234;00:03:57,853;Have the dead horses

24;00:05:46,295;00:05:48,747;It was a failure.
25;00:05:48,815;00:05:51,550;It wasn't.
26;00:05:51,601;00:05:53,802;I went to save them.
26;00:05:51,601;00:05:53,802;I failed.
27;00:05:55,605;00:05:57,639;You didn't fail him.
28;00:05:57,690;00:05:59,024;Or him.
29;00:05:59,058;00:06:01,860;Or her.

30;00:06:01,894;00:06:05,363;because of you and no one else.
31;00:06:06,816;00:06:09,317;I don't think that
31;00:06:06,816;00:06:09,317;fact's lost on them.
32;00:07:03,339;00:07:06,675;You have a good heart, Jon Snow.
33;00:07:06,709;00:07:09,177;It'll get us all killed.
34;00:07:15,301;00:07:17,135;Out of my way.
35;00:07:43,246;00:07:44,746;You sent for me, Your Grace?
36;00:07:44,797;00:07:47,048;Find some healthy horses and
36;00:07:44,797;00:07:47,048;a few knights to guard you.
37;00:07:47,083;00:07:49,084;I'm sending you back

42;00:07:58,595;00:08:01,930;He can guard all 19 castles
42;00:07:58,595;00:08:01,930;on the Wall if he so wishes.
43;00:08:04,233;00:08:07,235;Your Grace,
43;00:08:04,233;00:08:07,235;you named me your Hand.
44;00:08:07,270;00:08:08,837;Yes.
45;00:08:08,871;00:08:10,822;The King's Hand should

47;00:08:12,276;00:08:14,125;You're not abandoning me.
47;00:08:12,276;00:08:14,125;You're obeying a command.
48;00:08:14,160;00:08:16,578;A boy with a scroll
48;00:08:14,160;00:08:16,578;could deliver this message.
49;00:08:16,612;00:08:19,164;And if Jon Snow refuses
49;00:08:16,612;00:08:19,164;the boy with the scroll,
50;00:08:19,198;00:08:21,416;what does the boy say?
51;00:08:21,450;00:08:23,618;I didn't name you Hand for your

54;00:08:34,964;00:08:36,848;could accompany me.
55;00:08:36,882;00:08:38,934;My family stays with me.
56;00:08:38,968;00:08:40,969;At least let me take Shireen.
57;00:08:41,020;00:08:43,555;A siege is no place
57;00:08:41,020;00:08:43,555;for a little girl.
58;00:08:43,606;00:08:45,974;My family stays with me.
59;00:09:22,499;00:09:23,833;What's this one now?
60;00:09:23,867;00:09:26,202;The Dance of Dragons:
60;00:09:23,867;00:09:26,202;A True Telling
61;00:09:26,253;00:09:27,670;by Grand Maester Munkun.
62;00:09:27,704;00:09:31,040;Now that sounds
62;00:09:27,704;00:09:31,040;like a proper story.
63;00:09:31,091;00:09:33,709;Ser Byron Swann wanted
63;00:09:31,091;00:09:33,709;to kill the dragon Vhagar.
64;00:09:33,760;00:09:36,712;He polished his shield for a week
64;00:09:33,760;00:09:36,712;so that it was like a mirror.
65;00:09:36,763;00:09:38,798;And he crouched behind it
65;00:09:36,763;00:09:38,798;and crept forward,
66;00:09:38,800;00:09:40,850;hoping the dragon would
66;00:09:38,800;00:09:40,850;only see its own reflection.
67;00:09:40,884;00:09:43,969;But the dragon saw a dumb man
67;00:09:40,884;00:09:43,969;holding a mirrored shield.
68;00:09:44,020;00:09:45,688;And burnt him to a crisp.
69;00:09:46,940;00:09:49,308;Thus ending
69;00:09:46,940;00:09:49,308;the dragon-slaying career
70;00:09:49,310;00:09:52,144;of Ser Byron Swann.
71;00:09:54,481;00:09:56,782;I made you something, Princess.
72;00:10:03,323;00:10:04,657;Do you like it?
73;00:10:04,659;00:10:06,575;He's beautiful.
74;00:10:06,626;00:10:09,328;Thank you.
74;00:10:06,626;00:10:09,328;You're very welcome.
75;00:10:09,330;00:10:11,881;Will you make me a doe, too?
75;00:10:09,330;00:10:11,881;So that he can have company?
76;00:10:11,915;00:10:13,749;Of course I will.
77;00:10:15,218;00:10:16,836;But why am I getting a present?
78;00:10:18,421;00:10:19,922;Because you deserve it.
79;00:10:21,641;00:10:25,094;My son was always on me,
79;00:10:21,641;00:10:25,094;trying to teach me to read.
80;00:10:25,145;00:10:27,480;Gods, I was stubborn about it.
81;00:10:28,815;00:10:30,432;Made it this far
81;00:10:28,815;00:10:30,432;without reading.
82;00:10:30,484;00:10:32,985;Seemed to me I could
82;00:10:30,484;00:10:32,985;make it to the grave.
83;00:10:35,238;00:10:37,189;Wish I'd listened to him.
84;00:10:38,692;00:10:41,026;This is my own poor way
84;00:10:38,692;00:10:41,026;of saying thank you.
85;00:10:44,664;00:10:46,832;For teaching me
85;00:10:44,664;00:10:46,832;to be a grown-up.
86;00:10:49,503;00:10:52,288;I'll be gone for a
86;00:10:49,503;00:10:52,288;few days, Princess.
87;00:10:52,339;00:10:55,007;I want to hear all about The
87;00:10:52,339;00:10:55,007;Dance of Dragons when I'm back.
88;00:10:55,041;00:10:57,293;You'll read it yourself.
89;00:11:18,815;00:11:20,232;Prince Doran.
90;00:11:20,283;00:11:22,868;Forgive us.
90;00:11:20,283;00:11:22,868;We started without you.
91;00:11:23,737;00:11:25,621;Please, sit.
92;00:11:25,705;00:11:28,157;Princess Myrcella.
93;00:11:28,241;00:11:29,825;Uncle.
94;00:11:29,910;00:11:31,710;What a lovely dress.
95;00:11:31,745;00:11:34,046;You don't like it?
95;00:11:31,745;00:11:34,046;You must be cold.
96;00:11:34,080;00:11:37,716;Not at all. The Dornish
96;00:11:34,080;00:11:37,716;climate agrees with me.
97;00:11:38,885;00:11:41,587;Prince Trystane.
98;00:11:43,590;00:11:44,924;How's your jaw?
99;00:11:46,092;00:11:47,760;A fleabite.
100;00:11:47,762;00:11:49,395;What are you doing in Dorne?
101;00:11:49,429;00:11:51,697;Looking after the safety of my
101;00:11:49,429;00:11:51,697;niece, the Princess Myrcella.
102;00:11:51,731;00:11:55,067;And rather than send a raven
102;00:11:51,731;00:11:55,067;or speak to me directly,
103;00:11:55,101;00:11:57,436;you decided to enter
103;00:11:55,101;00:11:57,436;my country in secret
104;00:11:57,438;00:11:59,104;and abduct our guest by force?
105;00:11:59,106;00:12:02,358;We received
105;00:11:59,106;00:12:02,358;a threatening message.
106;00:12:02,409;00:12:05,611;The princess's necklace
106;00:12:02,409;00:12:05,611;in the jaws of a viper.
107;00:12:06,947;00:12:08,948;That necklace
107;00:12:06,947;00:12:08,948;was stolen from my room.
108;00:12:13,937;00:12:17,706;Oh, excellent.
109;00:12:17,757;00:12:19,959;A last meal before
109;00:12:17,757;00:12:19,959;the beheading?
110;00:12:19,961;00:12:21,543;Oh, I can't behead you.
111;00:12:21,595;00:12:24,013;Many in Dorne want war.
112;00:12:24,047;00:12:26,031;But I've seen war.
113;00:12:26,066;00:12:28,801;I've seen the bodies
113;00:12:26,066;00:12:28,801;piled on the battlefields.
114;00:12:28,803;00:12:32,321;I've seen the orphans
114;00:12:28,803;00:12:32,321;starving in the cities.
115;00:12:32,355;00:12:34,440;I don't want to lead
115;00:12:32,355;00:12:34,440;my people into that hell.
116;00:12:34,474;00:12:37,142;No, you want to break bread
116;00:12:34,474;00:12:37,142;with the Lannisters.
117;00:12:37,193;00:12:39,812;And that is precisely
117;00:12:37,193;00:12:39,812;what we are doing.
118;00:12:41,648;00:12:45,234;Let us drink to Tommen,
118;00:12:41,648;00:12:45,234;the First of His Name,

121;00:13:07,424;00:13:09,842;King Tommen insists
122;00:13:09,844;00:13:12,845;on his sister's return

123;00:13:12,847;00:13:15,014;I'm afraid he does.
124;00:13:17,017;00:13:20,152;I cannot disobey
124;00:13:17,017;00:13:20,152;my king's command.
125;00:13:20,186;00:13:22,655;She will return with you
125;00:13:20,186;00:13:22,655;to King's Landing.
126;00:13:22,689;00:13:26,108;And my son Prince Trystane
126;00:13:22,689;00:13:26,108;will accompany you both.
127;00:13:26,142;00:13:29,778;If the alliance between the Iron

128;00:13:29,863;00:13:31,280;their engagement must stand.
129;00:13:31,348;00:13:33,415;I accept.
130;00:13:33,450;00:13:36,118;One more thing.
130;00:13:33,450;00:13:36,118;My brother was named

272;00:23:26,125;00:23:30,545;Nothing better for your
272;00:23:26,125;00:23:30,545;cockstand than fresh oysters.
273;00:23:30,596;00:23:32,636;- Here. Thank you.
273;00:23:30,596;00:23:32,636;- I'll have one.
274;00:23:33,799;00:23:35,667;Any vinegar?
275;00:23:36,886;00:23:38,954;Who let this girl in?
275;00:23:36,886;00:23:38,954;Shoo! Shoo!
276;00:23:59,375;00:24:01,493;Good.
277;00:24:11,003;00:24:12,671;I'll tell you when we're done.
278;00:24:18,344;00:24:20,345;You'll have a fresh one
278;00:24:18,344;00:24:20,345;for me tomorrow?
279;00:24:20,396;00:24:22,731;Of course.
280;00:24:27,186;00:24:28,937;I'll have
280;00:24:27,186;00:24:28,937;you whipped, girl.
281;00:24:28,988;00:24:31,356;Go, go on.
281;00:24:28,988;00:24:31,356;Out, out, go.
282;00:24:43,202;00:24:45,120;Valar morghulis.
283;00:24:45,204;00:24:47,205;Valar morghulis.
284;00:25:02,638;00:25:04,055;And?
285;00:25:04,057;00:25:06,808;The thin man
285;00:25:04,057;00:25:06,808;wasn't hungry today.
286;00:25:06,842;00:25:08,943;Perhaps that is why
286;00:25:06,842;00:25:08,943;a man is thin.
287;00:25:08,978;00:25:10,729;Tomorrow.
288;00:25:10,763;00:25:13,898;Tomorrow.
289;00:25:14,984;00:25:17,018;A girl has work to do.
290;00:25:30,266;00:25:33,868;Your rebellion is over.
291;00:25:33,903;00:25:36,704;You can swear your
291;00:25:33,903;00:25:36,704;allegiance to me now...
292;00:25:38,174;00:25:40,091;or you can die.
293;00:26:15,294;00:26:17,595;I believe in second chances.
294;00:26:19,548;00:26:22,300;I don't believe
294;00:26:19,548;00:26:22,300;in third chances.
295;00:26:50,546;00:26:52,664;You write like
295;00:26:50,546;00:26:52,664;a seven-year-old.
296;00:26:54,250;00:26:56,501;Your maester kindly agreed
296;00:26:54,250;00:26:56,501;to copy it over for me.
297;00:26:56,552;00:26:58,052;He didn't try to make you pay?
298;00:26:58,087;00:26:59,804;Mm-mmm.
299;00:26:59,839;00:27:01,973;Maybe he's changed.
300;00:27:02,007;00:27:05,260;The queen will be thrilled to know
300;00:27:02,007;00:27:05,260;you're bringing her daughter home.
301;00:27:05,344;00:27:06,561;She will.
302;00:27:06,595;00:27:09,013;You love her very much,
302;00:27:06,595;00:27:09,013;don't you?
303;00:27:09,064;00:27:11,566;Of course, she's my niece.
304;00:27:11,600;00:27:13,518;I wasn't talking about her.
305;00:27:15,654;00:27:17,522;You think I disapprove?
306;00:27:17,524;00:27:19,190;Why?
307;00:27:19,192;00:27:22,193;Because people disapprove of that
307;00:27:19,192;00:27:22,193;sort of thing where you are from?
308;00:27:22,244;00:27:25,413;They disapproved of Oberyn
308;00:27:22,244;00:27:25,413;and me where you are from.
309;00:27:25,447;00:27:29,167;Here no one blinked an eye.
310;00:27:30,452;00:27:31,669;100 years ago,
311;00:27:31,704;00:27:34,372;no one would have
311;00:27:31,704;00:27:34,372;blinked an eye at you
312;00:27:34,456;00:27:36,207;if you'd been named Targaryen.
313;00:27:38,060;00:27:42,180;It's always changing, who we're
313;00:27:38,060;00:27:42,180;supposed to love and who we're not.
314;00:27:43,382;00:27:45,550;The only thing
314;00:27:43,382;00:27:45,550;that stays the same
315;00:27:45,552;00:27:48,419;is that we want who we want.
316;00:27:58,147;00:28:00,532;I know your daughter had no
316;00:27:58,147;00:28:00,532;part in the terrible thing
317;00:28:00,566;00:28:02,700;that happened to the man I love.
318;00:28:05,387;00:28:07,872;Perhaps even you
318;00:28:05,387;00:28:07,872;are innocent of that.
319;00:28:26,308;00:28:28,309;Father.
320;00:28:31,764;00:28:33,097;Aren't you cold?
321;00:28:35,434;00:28:37,518;No. What are you reading?
322;00:28:38,988;00:28:41,155;The Dance of Dragons.
322;00:28:38,988;00:28:41,155;What's it about?
323;00:28:41,190;00:28:43,675;It's the story of the fight
323;00:28:41,190;00:28:43,675;between Rhaenyra Targaryen
324;00:28:43,709;00:28:46,995;and her half-brother Aegon for
324;00:28:43,709;00:28:46,995;control over the Seven Kingdoms.
325;00:28:47,029;00:28:49,831;Both of them thought they
325;00:28:47,029;00:28:49,831;belonged on the Iron Throne.
326;00:28:49,865;00:28:53,117;When people started declaring
326;00:28:49,865;00:28:53,117;for one of them or the other,
327;00:28:53,168;00:28:55,420;their fight divided
327;00:28:53,168;00:28:55,420;the kingdoms in two.
328;00:28:55,454;00:28:58,840;Brothers fought brothers,
328;00:28:55,454;00:28:58,840;dragons fought dragons.
329;00:29:00,509;00:29:04,462;By the time it was over,
329;00:29:00,509;00:29:04,462;thousands were dead.
330;00:29:04,513;00:29:07,465;And it was a disaster
330;00:29:04,513;00:29:07,465;for the Targaryens as well.
331;00:29:07,516;00:29:10,268;They never truly recovered.
332;00:29:10,302;00:29:12,303;The Dance of Dragons.
333;00:29:14,056;00:29:16,107;Why is that a dance?
334;00:29:16,141;00:29:17,609;It's just what they call it.
335;00:29:17,643;00:29:19,811;Hmm, doesn't make much sense.
336;00:29:19,895;00:29:21,813;I think it's poetic.
337;00:29:28,654;00:29:31,205;If you had to choose
338;00:29:31,240;00:29:34,575;between Rhaenyra and Aegon...
339;00:29:36,161;00:29:37,662;who would you have chosen?
340;00:29:37,664;00:29:40,248;I wouldn't have chosen either.
341;00:29:40,299;00:29:43,468;It's all the choosing sides that
341;00:29:40,299;00:29:43,468;made everything so horrible.
342;00:29:43,502;00:29:45,803;Sometimes a person
342;00:29:43,502;00:29:45,803;has to choose.
343;00:29:47,840;00:29:51,142;Sometimes the world
343;00:29:47,840;00:29:51,142;forces his hand.
344;00:29:53,145;00:29:56,014;If a man knows what he is...
345;00:29:57,399;00:30:00,234;and remains true to himself...
346;00:30:03,689;00:30:05,907;the choice is no choice at all.
347;00:30:05,991;00:30:09,027;He must fulfill his destiny...
348;00:30:11,246;00:30:14,699;and become
348;00:30:11,246;00:30:14,699;who he is meant to be.
349;00:30:16,902;00:30:19,253;However much he may hate it.
350;00:30:20,506;00:30:23,374;It's all right, Father.
351;00:30:23,425;00:30:26,260;You don't even know
351;00:30:23,425;00:30:26,260;what I'm talking about.
352;00:30:26,295;00:30:28,046;It doesn't matter.
353;00:30:28,097;00:30:30,348;I want to help you.
354;00:30:30,382;00:30:32,050;Is there any way I can help?
355;00:30:39,892;00:30:41,309;Yes, there is.
356;00:30:41,360;00:30:43,194;Good. I want to.
357;00:30:46,014;00:30:48,232;I'm the Princess Shireen
357;00:30:46,014;00:30:48,232;of House Baratheon.
358;00:30:48,234;00:30:50,535;And I'm your daughter.
359;00:31:04,817;00:31:06,751;Forgive me.
360;00:31:47,876;00:31:50,261;Where's my father?
360;00:31:47,876;00:31:50,261;I want to see my father.
361;00:31:50,295;00:31:53,431;It will all be over
361;00:31:50,295;00:31:53,431;soon, Princess.
362;00:31:57,402;00:31:58,853;No.
363;00:32:01,640;00:32:03,691;Where's my father?
364;00:32:03,725;00:32:06,210;No, you can't do this.
364;00:32:03,725;00:32:06,210;Father, where are you?
365;00:32:06,245;00:32:08,696;Please, let me see my father.
366;00:32:08,730;00:32:11,566;Father, where are you?
366;00:32:08,730;00:32:11,566;Don't let her do this.
367;00:32:12,534;00:32:15,286;Please let go!
368;00:32:15,320;00:32:18,623;Let me see my father!
368;00:32:15,320;00:32:18,623;Where are you? Please!
369;00:32:18,657;00:32:20,992;It's what the Lord wants.
369;00:32:18,657;00:32:20,992;No.
370;00:32:21,043;00:32:24,078;Please! Let go! No!
370;00:32:21,043;00:32:24,078;It's a good thing.
371;00:32:24,129;00:32:26,247;A great thing.
371;00:32:24,129;00:32:26,247;-  Stop. Stop!
372;00:32:26,298;00:32:28,166;- Please!
372;00:32:26,298;00:32:28,166;- Hear us now, my Lord.
373;00:32:28,168;00:32:30,968;- You can't do this!
373;00:32:28,168;00:32:30,968;- For you, we offer up this girl
374;00:32:31,003;00:32:33,805;Please!
374;00:32:31,003;00:32:33,805;-...that you may cleanse her with your fire
375;00:32:33,839;00:32:35,807;and that its light
375;00:32:33,839;00:32:35,807;may lead our way.
376;00:32:35,841;00:32:37,842;Please! No, please
376;00:32:35,841;00:32:37,842;let me see my father.
377;00:32:37,893;00:32:40,061;If we don't act,
377;00:32:37,893;00:32:40,061;we'll all starve here.
378;00:32:40,095;00:32:42,063;All of us.
379;00:32:42,097;00:32:43,764;But if we make this sacrifice...
380;00:32:43,816;00:32:46,017;Accept this token
380;00:32:43,816;00:32:46,017;of our faith, my Lord,
381;00:32:46,019;00:32:48,903;and lead us from the darkness.
382;00:32:48,937;00:32:51,906;Lord of Light, show us the way.
382;00:32:48,937;00:32:51,906;Mother!
383;00:32:51,990;00:32:54,075;Mother, please!

387;00:33:01,701;00:33:03,701;Lord of
387;00:33:01,701;00:33:03,701;Light, protect us.

412;00:36:32,245;00:36:34,245;Clap your hands.
413;00:37:03,609;00:37:05,276;That one, the smaller man.
414;00:37:05,327;00:37:07,111;No question, that's where
414;00:37:05,327;00:37:07,111;you should put your money.
415;00:37:07,113;00:37:08,529;The smaller man it is.
416;00:37:08,580;00:37:10,448;I'm not putting
416;00:37:08,580;00:37:10,448;my money anywhere.
417;00:37:10,499;00:37:12,616;Kings and queens
417;00:37:10,499;00:37:12,616;never bet on the games.
418;00:37:12,667;00:37:14,952;Perhaps you should go
418;00:37:12,667;00:37:14,952;find someone who does.
419;00:37:14,954;00:37:17,922;People used to bet against me
419;00:37:14,954;00:37:17,922;when I fought in the pits.
420;00:37:17,956;00:37:20,958;He would have bet against me.
420;00:37:17,956;00:37:20,958;Common novice mistake.
421;00:37:21,009;00:37:23,043;I've spent much
421;00:37:21,009;00:37:23,043;of my life in this arena.
422;00:37:23,095;00:37:25,096;And in my experience,
422;00:37:23,095;00:37:25,096;large men do triumph
423;00:37:25,130;00:37:27,431;over smaller men
423;00:37:25,130;00:37:27,431;far more often than not.
424;00:37:27,466;00:37:30,351;Has your experience ever
424;00:37:27,466;00:37:30,351;involved any actual fighting?
425;00:37:30,385;00:37:32,019;You yourself?
426;00:37:32,053;00:37:34,972;Have you ever tried to kill another
426;00:37:32,053;00:37:34,972;man who was trying to kill you?
427;00:37:37,109;00:37:39,894;Whenever I got into the pit
427;00:37:37,109;00:37:39,894;against a beast like that one,
428;00:37:39,945;00:37:42,613;the crowd saw me, all
428;00:37:39,945;00:37:42,613;skin and bone back then,
429;00:37:42,647;00:37:45,950;then they saw a pile of angry
429;00:37:42,647;00:37:45,950;muscles ready to murder me.
430;00:37:45,984;00:37:48,152;They couldn't get their
430;00:37:45,984;00:37:48,152;money out fast enough.
431;00:37:48,203;00:37:51,655;But the pile of angry muscles
431;00:37:48,203;00:37:51,655;never had any muscles here
432;00:37:51,706;00:37:55,075;or... here.
433;00:37:55,127;00:37:56,827;And the big men
433;00:37:55,127;00:37:56,827;were always too slow
434;00:37:56,912;00:37:59,747;to stop my dagger from going
434;00:37:56,912;00:37:59,747;where their muscles weren't.
435;00:37:59,798;00:38:03,634;Yes, whenever I saw a beast like
435;00:37:59,798;00:38:03,634;that one standing across from me
436;00:38:03,668;00:38:07,755;making his beast faces,
436;00:38:03,668;00:38:07,755;I knew I could rest easy.
437;00:38:19,601;00:38:21,602;You don't approve?
438;00:38:21,653;00:38:24,522;There's always been more than enough
438;00:38:21,653;00:38:24,522;death in the world for my taste.
439;00:38:24,573;00:38:26,524;I can do without it
439;00:38:24,573;00:38:26,524;in my leisure time.
440;00:38:26,575;00:38:29,026;Fair enough. Yet it's
440;00:38:26,575;00:38:29,026;an unpleasant question,
441;00:38:29,028;00:38:33,447;but what great thing has ever been
441;00:38:29,028;00:38:33,447;accomplished without killing or cruelty?
442;00:38:33,532;00:38:36,784;It's easy to confuse what is
442;00:38:33,532;00:38:36,784;with what ought to be,
443;00:38:36,835;00:38:39,587;especially when what is
443;00:38:36,835;00:38:39,587;has worked out in your favor.
444;00:38:39,621;00:38:41,121;I'm not talking about myself.
445;00:38:41,173;00:38:43,791;I'm talking about the necessary
445;00:38:41,173;00:38:43,791;conditions for greatness.
446;00:38:43,842;00:38:45,759;That is greatness?
447;00:38:45,794;00:38:49,713;That is a vital part of the
447;00:38:45,794;00:38:49,713;great city of Meereen,
448;00:38:49,764;00:38:52,216;which existed
448;00:38:49,764;00:38:52,216;long before you or I
449;00:38:52,267;00:38:56,353;and will remain standing long after
449;00:38:52,267;00:38:56,353;we have returned to the dirt.
450;00:38:56,388;00:38:58,389;My father would have liked you.

452;00:39:10,735;00:39:13,037;One day your great city will
452;00:39:10,735;00:39:13,037;return to the dirt as well.
453;00:39:13,071;00:39:15,322;At your command?
453;00:39:13,071;00:39:15,322;If need be.
454;00:39:15,442;00:39:16,671;_
455;00:39:20,662;00:39:23,914;And how many people will die
455;00:39:20,662;00:39:23,914;to make this happen?
456;00:39:23,965;00:39:27,334;If it comes to that, they will
456;00:39:23,965;00:39:27,334;have died for a good reason.
457;00:39:27,385;00:39:29,470;Those men think they're
457;00:39:27,385;00:39:29,470;dying for a good reason.
458;00:39:29,504;00:39:31,255;Someone else's reason.
459;00:39:31,306;00:39:33,641;So your reasons are true
459;00:39:31,306;00:39:33,641;and theirs are false?
460;00:39:33,675;00:39:36,560;They don't know their
460;00:39:33,675;00:39:36,560;own minds, but you do?
461;00:39:36,595;00:39:39,597;Well said.
461;00:39:36,595;00:39:39,597;You're an eloquent man.
462;00:39:39,599;00:39:41,315;Doesn't mean you're wrong.
463;00:39:41,349;00:39:43,517;In my experience,
463;00:39:41,349;00:39:43,517;eloquent men are right
464;00:39:43,568;00:39:45,319;every bit as often as imbeciles.
