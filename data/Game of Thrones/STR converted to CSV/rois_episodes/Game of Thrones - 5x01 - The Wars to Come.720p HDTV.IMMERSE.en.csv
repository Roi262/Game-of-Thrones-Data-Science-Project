1;00:04:21,004;00:04:23,670;We shouldn't be out here alone.
1;00:04:21,004;00:04:23,670;Why not?
2;00:04:23,671;00:04:26,378;If your father--
2;00:04:23,671;00:04:26,378;He'll never know we're gone.
3;00:04:26,379;00:04:28,446;But if he finds out...
4;00:04:32,338;00:04:34,963;You don't need
4;00:04:32,338;00:04:34,963;to be afraid of my father.
5;00:05:02,088;00:05:04,503;Are you sure?
6;00:05:04,504;00:05:06,295;Yes.
7;00:05:06,296;00:05:09,504;We shouldn't go in.
7;00:05:06,296;00:05:09,504;Of course we should.
8;00:05:53,713;00:05:56,962;Get out.
8;00:05:53,713;00:05:56,962;Get out!
9;00:05:56,963;00:05:58,920;Let's go.
9;00:05:56,963;00:05:58,920;No.
10;00:05:58,921;00:06:00,696;Listen to your friend.
11;00:06:02,046;00:06:03,753;They said that you
11;00:06:02,046;00:06:03,753;were terrifying
12;00:06:03,754;00:06:07,837;with cat's teeth and three eyes.
13;00:06:07,838;00:06:09,713;You're not terrifying.
14;00:06:10,379;00:06:13,212;You're boring.
15;00:06:13,213;00:06:15,314;You don't know what I am.
16;00:06:15,434;00:06:18,832;I know you're a witch
16;00:06:15,434;00:06:18,832;and you can see the future.
17;00:06:20,213;00:06:22,128;Tell me mine.
18;00:06:22,129;00:06:24,420;Everyone wants
18;00:06:22,129;00:06:24,420;to know their future
19;00:06:24,421;00:06:26,545;until they know their future.
20;00:06:26,546;00:06:29,920;This is my father's land.
20;00:06:26,546;00:06:29,920;My land.
21;00:06:29,921;00:06:34,965;Tell me my future or I'll have your two
21;00:06:29,921;00:06:34,965;boring eyes gouged out of your head.
22;00:06:44,603;00:06:47,212;Your blood.
23;00:06:47,213;00:06:48,754;Give me a taste.
24;00:07:14,088;00:07:16,035;Three questions you get.
25;00:07:16,596;00:07:19,046;You won't like the answers.
26;00:07:22,713;00:07:25,420;I've been promised
26;00:07:22,713;00:07:25,420;to the prince.
27;00:07:25,421;00:07:28,545;When will we marry?
28;00:07:28,546;00:07:30,221;You will never wed the prince.
29;00:07:30,458;00:07:32,212;You will wed the king.
30;00:07:32,213;00:07:33,670;But I will be queen?
31;00:07:33,671;00:07:36,087;Oh, yes.
32;00:07:36,088;00:07:38,420;You'll be queen.
33;00:07:38,421;00:07:40,295;For a time.
34;00:07:40,296;00:07:43,378;Then comes another,
35;00:07:43,379;00:07:44,878;younger,
36;00:07:44,879;00:07:47,503;more beautiful,
37;00:07:47,504;00:07:50,795;to cast you down
37;00:07:47,504;00:07:50,795;and take all you hold dear.
38;00:07:50,796;00:07:54,003;W-will the king and I
38;00:07:50,796;00:07:54,003;have children?
39;00:07:54,004;00:07:59,399;No. The king will have 20
39;00:07:54,004;00:07:59,399;children and you will have three.
40;00:07:59,519;00:08:00,503;That doesn't make sense.
41;00:08:00,504;00:08:03,962;Gold will be their crowns.
42;00:08:03,963;00:08:06,838;Gold their shrouds.
43;00:08:14,129;00:08:15,670;Come on, we have to go.
44;00:08:16,463;00:08:19,128;We have to go!
44;00:08:16,463;00:08:19,128;Cersei!
45;00:08:23,088;00:08:25,087;Bearers, put it down.
46;00:08:40,421;00:08:43,795;Bearers, up.
47;00:08:43,796;00:08:45,546;Away.
48;00:08:59,213;00:09:01,962;Your Grace, we are
48;00:08:59,213;00:09:01,962;honored by your presence.
49;00:09:01,963;00:09:03,378;The mourners are waiting.
50;00:09:03,498;00:09:05,893;They will keep waiting.
51;00:09:05,997;00:09:07,746;I want a moment alone with him.
52;00:09:07,747;00:09:10,205;But, Your Grace, many of these lords
52;00:09:07,747;00:09:10,205;and ladies have travelled
53;00:09:10,206;00:09:12,371;day and night to be here from
53;00:09:10,206;00:09:12,371;all seven kingdoms.
54;00:09:12,372;00:09:14,122;They will wait.
55;00:09:41,372;00:09:43,496;He never wanted you
55;00:09:41,372;00:09:43,496;to be a Kingsguard,
56;00:09:43,497;00:09:47,247;but here you are,
56;00:09:43,497;00:09:47,247;protecting his dead body.
57;00:09:49,081;00:09:52,997;What he built, it's ours.
58;00:09:54,206;00:09:57,122;He built it for us.
58;00:09:54,206;00:09:57,122;He meant it for us.
59;00:09:59,372;00:10:00,871;They're going to try
59;00:09:59,372;00:10:00,871;to take it away.
60;00:10:00,872;00:10:02,246;All of it.
60;00:10:00,872;00:10:02,246;They?
61;00:10:02,247;00:10:03,955;All of them out there,
61;00:10:02,247;00:10:03,955;our enemies.
62;00:10:03,956;00:10:06,746;They're waiting in line to make sure
62;00:10:03,956;00:10:06,746;he's really dead.
63;00:10:06,747;00:10:09,538;And as soon as they see
63;00:10:06,747;00:10:09,538;the stones on his eyes,
64;00:10:09,539;00:10:11,371;they'll set to work
64;00:10:09,539;00:10:11,371;on tearing us apart.
65;00:10:11,372;00:10:14,121;They have nothing to do with it.
66;00:10:14,122;00:10:16,413;The man who murdered our father,
66;00:10:14,122;00:10:16,413;he tore us apart.
67;00:10:16,414;00:10:18,746;He's the enemy.
67;00:10:16,414;00:10:18,746;I've been telling you for years.
68;00:10:18,747;00:10:19,788;You've been defending
68;00:10:18,747;00:10:19,788;him for years.
69;00:10:19,789;00:10:21,955;This is exactly what they want.
70;00:10:21,956;00:10:23,580;And now our father is dead
71;00:10:23,581;00:10:27,039;and that little monster
71;00:10:23,581;00:10:27,039;is out there somewhere drawing breath.
72;00:10:29,164;00:10:31,331;Did you set him free?
73;00:10:33,956;00:10:35,663;Tyrion may be a monster,
74;00:10:35,664;00:10:39,663;but at least he killed
74;00:10:35,664;00:10:39,663;our father on purpose.
75;00:10:39,664;00:10:41,788;You killed him by mistake.
76;00:10:41,789;00:10:43,581;With stupidity.
77;00:10:45,081;00:10:46,496;You're a man
77;00:10:45,081;00:10:46,496;of action, aren't you?
78;00:10:46,497;00:10:49,038;When it occurs to you
78;00:10:46,497;00:10:49,038;to do something, you do it.
79;00:10:49,039;00:10:52,039;Never mind the consequences.
80;00:10:53,997;00:10:56,705;Take a look.
81;00:10:56,706;00:10:57,706;Look at the consequences.
82;00:11:00,706;00:11:02,539;Here they are.
83;00:11:06,414;00:11:09,706;He loved you more than
83;00:11:06,414;00:11:09,706;anyone in this world.
84;00:12:41,956;00:12:43,789;Apologies.
85;00:12:53,789;00:12:57,163;I still don't see
85;00:12:53,789;00:12:57,163;why I had to stay
86;00:12:57,164;00:12:59,246;in this fucking crate
86;00:12:57,164;00:12:59,246;once we set sail.
87;00:12:59,247;00:13:02,163;I saved your life.
88;00:13:02,164;00:13:04,913;If they catch you,
88;00:13:02,164;00:13:04,913;they catch me.
89;00:13:04,914;00:13:06,955;I cannot say
89;00:13:04,914;00:13:06,955;I feel overly guilty
90;00:13:06,956;00:13:09,038;about leaving you
90;00:13:06,956;00:13:09,038;in that fucking crate.
91;00:13:09,039;00:13:11,746;Do you know what it's like
91;00:13:09,039;00:13:11,746;to stuff your shit
92;00:13:11,747;00:13:13,413;through one of those airholes?
93;00:13:13,414;00:13:14,705;No, I only know what it's like
94;00:13:14,706;00:13:17,872;to pick up your shit
94;00:13:14,706;00:13:17,872;and throw it overboard.
95;00:13:21,206;00:13:23,496;Pentos?
96;00:13:23,497;00:13:25,955;The home of my colleague
96;00:13:23,497;00:13:25,955;Illyrio Mopatis,
97;00:13:25,956;00:13:28,330;a merchant.
98;00:13:28,331;00:13:30,288;He and I met many years ago
99;00:13:30,289;00:13:31,705;through mutual friends.
100;00:13:31,706;00:13:35,080;A group of people
100;00:13:31,706;00:13:35,080;who saw Robert Baratheon
101;00:13:35,081;00:13:36,538;for the disaster he was.
102;00:13:36,539;00:13:39,580;We tried to do what
102;00:13:36,539;00:13:39,580;was best for the realm
103;00:13:39,581;00:13:43,121;by supporting
103;00:13:39,581;00:13:43,121;a Targaryen restoration.
104;00:13:43,122;00:13:45,746;And thus began
104;00:13:43,122;00:13:45,746;the chain of mistakes
105;00:13:45,747;00:13:48,371;that has led us both here.
106;00:13:48,372;00:13:51,830;Things have gotten worse,
106;00:13:48,372;00:13:51,830;not better.
107;00:13:51,831;00:13:54,914;Westeros needs to be
107;00:13:51,831;00:13:54,914;saved from itself.
108;00:13:58,664;00:14:00,538;Mmm.
109;00:14:00,539;00:14:01,996;Much better.
110;00:14:01,997;00:14:03,664;My lord?
111;00:14:05,706;00:14:08,538;I don't think I am anymore.
112;00:14:08,539;00:14:10,747;A lord.
113;00:14:18,581;00:14:20,539;Are you a lord
113;00:14:18,581;00:14:20,539;if you kill your father?
114;00:14:22,914;00:14:26,580;I don't imagine
114;00:14:22,914;00:14:26,580;they revoke your nobility
115;00:14:26,581;00:14:28,538;for killing a whore.
116;00:14:28,539;00:14:30,455;It must happen all the time.
117;00:14:30,456;00:14:32,871;You already drank yourself
117;00:14:30,456;00:14:32,871;across the Narrow Sea.
118;00:14:32,872;00:14:34,455;In a box.
118;00:14:32,872;00:14:34,455;Why stop now?
119;00:14:34,456;00:14:37,872;Because we are talking
119;00:14:34,456;00:14:37,872;about the future of our country.
120;00:14:41,747;00:14:44,456;The future is shit.
121;00:14:46,664;00:14:48,539;Just like the past.
122;00:16:40,586;00:16:41,918;_
123;00:16:42,038;00:16:44,392;_

127;00:17:08,706;00:17:09,913;Shh.
128;00:17:09,914;00:17:11,622;Shh.
129;00:17:56,122;00:17:57,913;The Sons of the Harpy?
130;00:17:57,914;00:18:00,246;Yes, Your Grace.
130;00:17:57,914;00:18:00,246;They left it on the body.
131;00:18:00,247;00:18:01,580;They've never killed before.
132;00:18:01,581;00:18:04,080;It was only a matter
132;00:18:01,581;00:18:04,080;of time, Your Grace.
133;00:18:04,081;00:18:06,580;Conquerors always meet
133;00:18:04,081;00:18:06,580;with resistance.
134;00:18:06,581;00:18:08,663;I didn't conquer them.
134;00:18:06,581;00:18:08,663;Their own people did.
135;00:18:09,074;00:18:12,541;_

137;00:18:16,997;00:18:19,746;He did not risk his life
137;00:18:16,997;00:18:19,746;fighting for his freedom
138;00:18:19,747;00:18:21,746;so cowards in masks
138;00:18:19,747;00:18:21,746;could take it away.
139;00:18:21,747;00:18:23,246;And I did not take up
139;00:18:21,747;00:18:23,246;residence in this pyramid
140;00:18:23,247;00:18:26,705;so I could watch the city below
140;00:18:23,247;00:18:26,705;decline into chaos.
141;00:18:26,706;00:18:29,246;What was the name
141;00:18:26,706;00:18:29,246;of the man you lost?

143;00:18:32,706;00:18:36,871;I want him buried
143;00:18:32,706;00:18:36,871;with honor, publically
144;00:18:36,872;00:18:39,288;in the Temple of the Graces.

145;00:18:39,289;00:18:41,330;will hear that message.
146;00:18:41,331;00:18:43,038;Make them very angry.
147;00:18:43,039;00:18:44,996;Angry snakes lash out.
148;00:18:44,997;00:18:47,705;Makes chopping off their heads
148;00:18:44,997;00:18:47,705;that much easier.
149;00:18:47,706;00:18:51,122;Find the men who did this
149;00:18:47,706;00:18:51,122;and bring them to me.
150;00:18:54,497;00:18:55,497;Your Grace.
151;00:19:09,997;00:19:11,996;Torgo Nudho.
152;00:19:11,997;00:19:13,872;Missandei hin Naath.
153;00:19:16,164;00:19:17,456;I wanted to speak with you.
154;00:19:26,289;00:19:28,621;Why do you come?
155;00:19:28,622;00:19:31,581;White Rat, the Unsullied who...
156;00:19:33,872;00:19:37,081;I have heard they found
156;00:19:33,872;00:19:37,081;his body in a brothel.
157;00:19:38,331;00:19:41,246;I have heard that
157;00:19:38,331;00:19:41,246;more than one Unsullied
158;00:19:41,247;00:19:43,914;has been known to visit
158;00:19:41,247;00:19:43,914;Meereen's brothels.
159;00:19:46,914;00:19:48,414;May I ask you why?
160;00:19:50,164;00:19:52,497;Why would an Unsullied
160;00:19:50,164;00:19:52,497;go to a brothel?
161;00:19:56,081;00:19:58,997;I do not know.
162;00:19:59,914;00:20:02,539;I must go.
163;00:20:17,622;00:20:19,746;Get your shield up.
163;00:20:17,622;00:20:19,746;It's too heavy.
164;00:20:19,747;00:20:22,038;If it wasn't heavy,
164;00:20:19,747;00:20:22,038;it wouldn't stop a sword.
165;00:20:22,039;00:20:23,581;Now get it up.
166;00:20:35,247;00:20:38,746;Come.
166;00:20:35,247;00:20:38,746;Try it again.
167;00:20:38,747;00:20:41,871;Drive at me.
167;00:20:38,747;00:20:41,871;Keep your shield up.
168;00:20:41,872;00:20:44,330;Or I'll ring
168;00:20:41,872;00:20:44,330;your head like a bell.
169;00:20:44,331;00:20:47,121;Shouldn't you be training, too?
170;00:20:47,122;00:20:49,622;Well, I'm hardly a new recruit.
171;00:20:52,914;00:20:55,455;How many brothers can say that they've
171;00:20:52,914;00:20:55,455;killed a white walker and a Thenn?
172;00:20:55,456;00:20:58,580;I might be the first in history.
173;00:20:58,581;00:21:00,496;- Shield up.
173;00:20:58,581;00:21:00,496;These men need a firm hand.
174;00:21:00,497;00:21:02,246;Always have.
175;00:21:02,247;00:21:04,414;They're poachers and thieves.
176;00:21:07,081;00:21:08,997;Not soldiers.
177;00:21:14,831;00:21:16,581;That one hates me.
178;00:21:18,706;00:21:20,913;If Ser Alliser
178;00:21:18,706;00:21:20,913;is chosen as the new Lord Commander...
179;00:21:20,914;00:21:24,580;He hates the wildlings.
180;00:21:24,581;00:21:26,371;All the wildlings.
181;00:21:26,372;00:21:28,955;- Don't let them send us away.
181;00:21:26,372;00:21:28,955;It's not a sure thing.
182;00:21:28,956;00:21:31,496;Ser Denys Mallister has
182;00:21:28,956;00:21:31,496;commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years
183;00:21:31,497;00:21:33,330;and people say he's a good man.
184;00:21:33,331;00:21:34,455;He's running against
184;00:21:33,331;00:21:34,455;Ser Alliser--
185;00:21:34,456;00:21:37,080;Sam, don't let them
185;00:21:34,456;00:21:37,080;send us away.
186;00:21:37,081;00:21:38,330;I told you.
187;00:21:38,331;00:21:41,455;Wherever you go, I go, too.
188;00:21:41,456;00:21:43,747;You can't leave.
188;00:21:41,456;00:21:43,747;They'll execute you.
189;00:21:51,747;00:21:53,707;Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot.
189;00:21:51,747;00:21:53,707;Yah!
190;00:21:55,372;00:21:56,456;Shield up.
191;00:21:59,039;00:22:00,914;The king wants a word.
192;00:22:28,372;00:22:30,538;You're not cold, my lady?
193;00:22:30,539;00:22:32,705;Never.
194;00:22:32,706;00:22:36,706;The Lord's fire lives
194;00:22:32,706;00:22:36,706;within me, Jon Snow.
195;00:22:39,456;00:22:41,247;Feel.
196;00:22:48,497;00:22:50,331;Are you a virgin?
197;00:22:53,789;00:22:55,872;No.
198;00:22:57,456;00:22:59,331;Good.
199;00:23:06,039;00:23:08,496;Your Grace.
200;00:23:08,497;00:23:10,706;The bastard of Winterfell.
201;00:23:18,497;00:23:21,539;You know who rules
201;00:23:18,497;00:23:21,539;at Winterfell now?
202;00:23:22,706;00:23:24,496;Roose Bolton.
203;00:23:24,497;00:23:27,789;Mmm, the traitor who plunged a dagger
203;00:23:24,497;00:23:27,789;in Robb Stark's heart.
204;00:23:28,747;00:23:31,331;Don't you want to avenge him?
205;00:23:32,664;00:23:35,663;I want a great
205;00:23:32,664;00:23:35,663;many things, Your Grace.
206;00:23:35,664;00:23:38,163;But I'm a sworn brother
206;00:23:35,664;00:23:38,163;of the Night's Watch now.
207;00:23:38,164;00:23:41,496;I've been talking
207;00:23:38,164;00:23:41,496;to your sworn brothers.
208;00:23:41,497;00:23:43,205;Many of them love you.
208;00:23:41,497;00:23:43,205;They're good men.
209;00:23:43,206;00:23:44,913;Many don't.
210;00:23:44,914;00:23:48,913;You were seen taking the body
210;00:23:44,914;00:23:48,913;of a wildling girl north of the Wall.
211;00:23:48,914;00:23:50,580;Why?
212;00:23:50,581;00:23:51,788;It's where she belonged.
213;00:23:51,789;00:23:54,205;Some of the Night's
213;00:23:51,789;00:23:54,205;Watch feel you have
214;00:23:54,206;00:23:56,163;too much affection
214;00:23:54,206;00:23:56,163;for the wildlings.
215;00:23:56,164;00:23:58,580;They were born on the
215;00:23:56,164;00:23:58,580;wrong side of the Wall.
216;00:23:58,581;00:24:00,621;That doesn't make them monsters.
217;00:24:00,622;00:24:01,913;No matter.
218;00:24:01,914;00:24:02,913;I shall take back the North
219;00:24:02,914;00:24:04,830;from the thieves who stole it.
220;00:24:04,831;00:24:07,413;Tywin Lannister is dead.
220;00:24:04,831;00:24:07,413;He can't protect them now.
221;00:24:07,414;00:24:10,996;I shall mount Roose Bolton's
221;00:24:07,414;00:24:10,996;head on a spike.
222;00:24:10,997;00:24:13,705;But if I'm to take Winterfell,
222;00:24:10,997;00:24:13,705;I need more men.
223;00:24:13,706;00:24:15,705;The men of the Night's Watch
223;00:24:13,706;00:24:15,705;are sworn to play no part--
224;00:24:15,706;00:24:18,705;I'm not talking about
224;00:24:15,706;00:24:18,705;the damn Night's Watch.
225;00:24:18,706;00:24:20,456;I'm talking about the wildlings.
226;00:24:28,456;00:24:32,580;Your Grace,
226;00:24:28,456;00:24:32,580;you want the wildlings
227;00:24:32,581;00:24:34,580;to march in your army?
228;00:24:34,581;00:24:35,871;If they swear to follow me,
228;00:24:34,581;00:24:35,871;I'll pardon them.
229;00:24:35,872;00:24:38,455;We'll take Winterfell.
229;00:24:35,872;00:24:38,455;Once the North is won,
230;00:24:38,456;00:24:39,371;I'll declare them
230;00:24:38,456;00:24:39,371;citizens of the realm.
231;00:24:39,372;00:24:41,580;I'll give them land to live on.
232;00:24:41,581;00:24:45,746;It's a fair offer.
232;00:24:41,581;00:24:45,746;More than fair.
233;00:24:45,747;00:24:47,705;I'll offer them their lives
233;00:24:45,747;00:24:47,705;and their freedom
234;00:24:47,706;00:24:50,746;if Mance kneels before me
234;00:24:47,706;00:24:50,746;and swears his loyalty.
235;00:24:50,747;00:24:51,868;I don't think that's likely.
236;00:24:54,706;00:24:56,121;You admire him, don't you?
237;00:24:56,122;00:24:58,871;I respect him.
237;00:24:56,122;00:24:58,871;He likes you.
238;00:24:58,872;00:25:00,788;Convince him to bend the knee...
238;00:24:58,872;00:25:00,788;Your Grace.
239;00:25:00,789;00:25:02,122;...or he burns.
240;00:25:06,039;00:25:07,496;How much time do I have?
241;00:25:07,497;00:25:09,163;Nightfall.
242;00:25:09,164;00:25:11,455;The sun drops fast
242;00:25:09,164;00:25:11,455;this time of year.
243;00:25:11,456;00:25:13,121;Hurry, Jon Snow.
244;00:25:16,747;00:25:18,330;Shield up.
245;00:25:18,331;00:25:21,163;Attack, my lord!
246;00:25:21,164;00:25:22,538;Attack!
247;00:25:22,539;00:25:26,163;Don't cross your feet.
248;00:25:26,164;00:25:27,913;My sons had swords
248;00:25:26,164;00:25:27,913;in their hands
249;00:25:27,914;00:25:29,538;from the time they could walk.
249;00:25:27,914;00:25:29,538;This one...
250;00:25:29,539;00:25:31,705;Lord Arryn will never
250;00:25:29,539;00:25:31,705;be a great warrior.
251;00:25:31,706;00:25:33,705;Great warrior?
252;00:25:33,706;00:25:36,330;He swings a sword
252;00:25:33,706;00:25:36,330;like a girl with palsy.
253;00:25:36,331;00:25:39,246;My lord.
254;00:25:39,247;00:25:41,121;Sword up, my lord!
255;00:25:48,622;00:25:50,496;Some boys develop more slowly.
256;00:25:50,497;00:25:52,788;He's still young.
257;00:25:52,789;00:25:55,913;He's 13.
257;00:25:52,789;00:25:55,913;Boys go to war at 13.
258;00:25:55,914;00:25:57,955;He has other gifts.
258;00:25:55,914;00:25:57,955;Does he?
259;00:25:57,956;00:26:00,746;The gift of a great name.
260;00:26:00,747;00:26:04,496;Sometimes that's all one needs.
261;00:26:09,456;00:26:12,205;Good-bye, Lord Royce, and thank you
261;00:26:09,456;00:26:12,205;for all you've done for me.
262;00:26:12,206;00:26:14,621;I have done nothing more
262;00:26:12,206;00:26:14,621;than my duty, my lady.
263;00:26:14,622;00:26:15,955;I have no doubt
263;00:26:14,622;00:26:15,955;that on my return,
264;00:26:15,956;00:26:18,913;Robin's skills will have
264;00:26:15,956;00:26:18,913;improved immeasurably.
265;00:26:18,914;00:26:20,080;He'll be safe here.
266;00:26:20,081;00:26:24,038;As for his skills,
267;00:26:24,039;00:26:26,247;I make no promises.
268;00:26:39,206;00:26:42,413;Will we head north
268;00:26:39,206;00:26:42,413;at some point?
269;00:26:42,414;00:26:45,705;He said Sansa had a brother
269;00:26:42,414;00:26:45,705;at Castle Black.
270;00:26:45,706;00:26:47,330;We're a few days' ride
270;00:26:45,706;00:26:47,330;from the Kingsroad.
271;00:26:47,331;00:26:50,414;But that will take us--
271;00:26:47,331;00:26:50,414;Us?
272;00:26:52,664;00:26:54,955;The only reason you're here
272;00:26:52,664;00:26:54,955;is because Jaime Lannister
273;00:26:54,956;00:26:56,622;told me you weren't
273;00:26:54,956;00:26:56,622;safe in the capital.
274;00:26:58,747;00:27:01,705;You're hundreds of miles
274;00:26:58,747;00:27:01,705;from King's Landing.
275;00:27:01,706;00:27:03,705;No one knows what you look like.
276;00:27:03,706;00:27:06,121;No one cares.
276;00:27:03,706;00:27:06,121;You're safe.
277;00:27:06,122;00:27:09,622;But I'm your squire.
277;00:27:06,122;00:27:09,622;Do you even know what a squire is?
278;00:27:11,414;00:27:12,205;An attendant to a knight.
279;00:27:12,206;00:27:14,830;I'm not a knight.
280;00:27:14,831;00:27:17,080;That means you're not a squire.
281;00:27:17,081;00:27:18,163;Well, where would I go?
282;00:27:18,164;00:27:21,039;I don't care.
282;00:27:18,164;00:27:21,039;I'm not your mother.
283;00:27:29,706;00:27:31,830;You swore to find
283;00:27:29,706;00:27:31,830;the Stark girls.
284;00:27:31,831;00:27:34,621;I found Arya. She didn't want
284;00:27:31,831;00:27:34,621;my protection.
285;00:27:34,622;00:27:36,831;-  Sansa still might.
285;00:27:34,622;00:27:36,831;Will you shut your mouth?
286;00:27:37,997;00:27:39,831;I didn't ask for your advice.
287;00:27:41,664;00:27:44,496;I don't want anyone
287;00:27:41,664;00:27:44,496;following me.
288;00:27:44,497;00:27:46,413;I'm not a leader.
289;00:27:46,414;00:27:49,413;All I ever wanted
289;00:27:46,414;00:27:49,413;was to fight for a lord I believed in.
290;00:27:49,414;00:27:52,331;The good lords are dead
290;00:27:49,414;00:27:52,331;and the rest are monsters.
291;00:28:03,331;00:28:05,580;You told Lord Royce
291;00:28:03,331;00:28:05,580;we were going to the Fingers.
292;00:28:05,581;00:28:07,788;I did.
293;00:28:07,789;00:28:10,913;But we're heading west.
293;00:28:07,789;00:28:10,913;We are.
294;00:28:10,914;00:28:12,872;If he wanted to betray us,
294;00:28:10,914;00:28:12,872;he already would have.
295;00:28:14,414;00:28:18,163;Lord Royce might be as honorable
295;00:28:14,414;00:28:18,163;as he thinks he is,
296;00:28:18,164;00:28:20,538;but he's not alone
296;00:28:18,164;00:28:20,538;in that castle.
297;00:28:20,539;00:28:21,621;Do you trust all those
297;00:28:20,539;00:28:21,621;knights and ladies,
298;00:28:21,622;00:28:24,830;stable boys and serving girls?
299;00:28:24,831;00:28:27,788;No, do you trust the carriage driver
299;00:28:24,831;00:28:27,788;or the knights escorting us?
300;00:28:27,789;00:28:29,246;No.
301;00:28:29,247;00:28:31,871;But I pay them well
302;00:28:31,872;00:28:34,163;and they've seen what happens
302;00:28:31,872;00:28:34,163;to men who disappoint me.
303;00:28:34,164;00:28:36,538;So where are we going?
304;00:28:36,539;00:28:38,955;To a land where
304;00:28:36,539;00:28:38,955;you trust everyone?
305;00:28:38,956;00:28:41,705;To a land so far from here,
306;00:28:41,706;00:28:43,626;even Cersei Lannister
306;00:28:41,706;00:28:43,626;can't get her hands on you.
307;00:28:52,497;00:28:55,581;It was such a deep,
307;00:28:52,497;00:28:55,581;deep shock to us all.
308;00:28:59,122;00:29:00,288;Your father was a--
309;00:29:00,289;00:29:03,246;a force to be reckoned with.
310;00:29:03,247;00:29:04,455;He truly was.
311;00:29:04,456;00:29:07,621;I wouldn't presume to claim
312;00:29:07,622;00:29:09,955;to have known him
312;00:29:07,622;00:29:09,955;as such, but--
313;00:29:09,956;00:29:13,496;but just being in his presence was enough
313;00:29:09,956;00:29:13,496;to make it so clear
314;00:29:13,497;00:29:15,663;just how formidable
314;00:29:13,497;00:29:15,663;a person you were dealing with.
315;00:29:15,664;00:29:19,038;What a-- what a force
315;00:29:15,664;00:29:19,038;to be reckoned with.
316;00:29:21,581;00:29:23,956;Thank you so much
316;00:29:21,581;00:29:23,956;for your kind words.
317;00:29:28,622;00:29:31,163;Deepest condolences, Your Grace.
318;00:29:31,164;00:29:33,205;This tragedy...
318;00:29:31,164;00:29:33,205;I never trusted Varys.
319;00:29:33,206;00:29:36,247;I often warned...
320;00:29:38,956;00:29:41,081;Your Grace.
321;00:29:43,831;00:29:46,330;Cousin Lancel.
321;00:29:43,831;00:29:46,330;I hardly recognized you.
322;00:29:46,331;00:29:48,621;My deepest sympathies.
323;00:29:48,622;00:29:51,746;I apologize
323;00:29:48,622;00:29:51,746;for my son's appearance.
324;00:29:51,747;00:29:52,868;Uncle, it's quite all right.
325;00:29:56,289;00:29:58,330;They call themselves sparrows.
326;00:29:58,331;00:30:01,038;Bloody fanatics.
327;00:30:01,039;00:30:03,038;Religion has its place,
327;00:30:01,039;00:30:03,038;of course,
328;00:30:03,039;00:30:05,871;but at a certain point...
329;00:30:05,872;00:30:08,830;They never would have come to the capital
329;00:30:05,872;00:30:08,830;when Tywin was alive.
330;00:30:08,831;00:30:10,496;I'm sure he'll grow out of it,
331;00:30:10,497;00:30:12,496;whatever it is.
332;00:30:12,497;00:30:15,039;Excuse me.
332;00:30:12,497;00:30:15,039;Of course.
333;00:30:33,456;00:30:36,163;Your wounds from the Blackwater
333;00:30:33,456;00:30:36,163;seem to have healed.
334;00:30:36,164;00:30:38,539;It wasn't my wounds
334;00:30:36,164;00:30:38,539;that needed healing.
335;00:30:41,247;00:30:44,164;What can I do for you?
336;00:30:45,164;00:30:47,413;You can forgive me.
337;00:30:47,414;00:30:50,246;What could you possibly
337;00:30:47,414;00:30:50,246;have done to warrant my forgiveness?
338;00:30:50,247;00:30:52,955;I led you into the darkness.
339;00:30:52,956;00:30:54,371;I doubt you've ever
339;00:30:52,956;00:30:54,371;led anyone anywhere.
340;00:30:54,372;00:30:57,163;I tempted you into our...
341;00:30:57,164;00:31:00,414;unnatural relations.
342;00:31:01,956;00:31:04,414;And, of course,
342;00:31:01,956;00:31:04,414;there was the king...
343;00:31:05,997;00:31:08,831;his boar hunt.
344;00:31:10,831;00:31:11,914;His wine.
345;00:31:15,581;00:31:17,455;I don't know what
345;00:31:15,581;00:31:17,455;you're talking about.
346;00:31:17,456;00:31:20,706;I'm a different person now.
347;00:31:22,497;00:31:25,246;I've found peace
347;00:31:22,497;00:31:25,246;in the light of the Seven.
348;00:31:25,247;00:31:26,913;You can, too.
349;00:31:26,914;00:31:28,538;They watch over all of us,
350;00:31:28,539;00:31:31,080;ready to dole out mercy
351;00:31:31,081;00:31:32,581;or justice.
352;00:31:35,456;00:31:38,331;Their world is at hand.
353;00:31:41,081;00:31:42,746;I will pray for
353;00:31:41,081;00:31:42,746;your father's soul.
354;00:31:45,331;00:31:48,914;The day Tywin Lannister's
354;00:31:45,331;00:31:48,914;soul needs your help...
355;00:31:57,747;00:32:00,205;It looks like Dorne.
355;00:31:57,747;00:32:00,205;It doesn't.
356;00:32:00,206;00:32:03,121;It does.
357;00:32:03,122;00:32:07,247;That's the--
357;00:32:03,122;00:32:07,247;that's the Sunspear bit right there.
358;00:32:08,456;00:32:10,163;And that's where
358;00:32:08,456;00:32:10,163;the mountains are.
359;00:32:10,164;00:32:13,496;And over here is--
360;00:32:13,497;00:32:16,288;is Sunsnake?
361;00:32:16,289;00:32:16,913;Stonespear?
362;00:32:16,914;00:32:19,413;Sandstone.
363;00:32:19,414;00:32:20,996;Yes.
364;00:32:20,997;00:32:23,413;Yes, Sandstone.
365;00:32:24,831;00:32:26,163;Just there.
366;00:32:26,164;00:32:28,164;Fine.
367;00:32:30,872;00:32:31,539;It's Dorne.
368;00:32:33,831;00:32:36,038;We should go there.
369;00:32:36,039;00:32:38,413;I think we would
369;00:32:36,039;00:32:38,413;have a lovely time,
370;00:32:38,414;00:32:40,788;judging by my experience.
371;00:32:40,789;00:32:45,538;That would be wonderful.
371;00:32:40,789;00:32:45,538;Dorne, Highgarden.
372;00:32:45,539;00:32:47,081;Anywhere but here.
373;00:32:56,206;00:32:58,122;We're late for dinner as it is.
374;00:32:58,914;00:33:00,538;You're very respectful.
375;00:33:00,539;00:33:01,414;I'm very hungry.
376;00:33:19,081;00:33:21,871;What's your name?
377;00:33:21,872;00:33:23,538;Olyvar, my lady.
378;00:33:23,539;00:33:25,371;I'm afraid my brother
379;00:33:25,372;00:33:28,831;is keeping the king
379;00:33:25,372;00:33:28,831;waiting, Olyvar.
380;00:33:37,706;00:33:39,539;My lady.
381;00:33:52,039;00:33:55,788;Perhaps you might
381;00:33:52,039;00:33:55,788;consider being a bit more discreet?
382;00:33:55,789;00:33:57,538;Why?
383;00:33:57,539;00:33:59,871;They all know about me anyway.
384;00:33:59,872;00:34:03,163;Everybody knows everything
384;00:33:59,872;00:34:03,163;about everyone.
385;00:34:03,164;00:34:06,330;What's the point in trying to
385;00:34:03,164;00:34:06,330;keep a secret in a place like this?
386;00:34:06,331;00:34:09,622;In any event, you shouldn't
386;00:34:06,331;00:34:09,622;keep your intended waiting.
387;00:34:10,331;00:34:13,038;My intended?
387;00:34:10,331;00:34:13,038;Please.
388;00:34:13,039;00:34:14,455;Tywin's dead.
389;00:34:14,456;00:34:16,871;That means no one
389;00:34:14,456;00:34:16,871;can force Cersei to marry me.
390;00:34:16,872;00:34:19,080;Lucky you.
390;00:34:16,872;00:34:19,080;Unlucky you.
391;00:34:19,081;00:34:20,538;You think I want that woman
391;00:34:19,081;00:34:20,538;married to my brother?
392;00:34:20,539;00:34:24,621;If she doesn't marry me,
392;00:34:20,539;00:34:24,621;she doesn't go to Highgarden.
393;00:34:24,622;00:34:27,330;Which means she stays
393;00:34:24,622;00:34:27,330;in King's Landing.
394;00:34:27,331;00:34:29,913;Which means you're trapped here with
394;00:34:27,331;00:34:29,913;Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.
395;00:34:29,914;00:34:31,497;Perhaps.
396;00:34:33,539;00:34:35,580;Perhaps?
397;00:34:35,581;00:34:36,414;Perhaps.
398;00:34:50,122;00:34:53,996;Eunuch, the Spider, the
398;00:34:50,122;00:34:53,996;Master of Whisperers.
399;00:34:53,997;00:34:57,289;Imp, Half-man.
400;00:34:59,622;00:35:01,955;There are faster ways
400;00:34:59,622;00:35:01,955;to kill yourself.
401;00:35:01,956;00:35:03,705;Not for a coward.
402;00:35:03,706;00:35:05,746;You are many things, my friend,
403;00:35:05,747;00:35:07,497;but not a coward.
404;00:35:11,456;00:35:13,830;You never told me
404;00:35:11,456;00:35:13,830;why you set me free.
405;00:35:13,831;00:35:16,830;Your brother asked me to.
406;00:35:16,831;00:35:18,080;Could have said no.
407;00:35:18,081;00:35:21,330;Refuse the Kingslayer?
407;00:35:18,081;00:35:21,330;A dangerous proposition.
408;00:35:21,331;00:35:23,580;Not as dangerous
408;00:35:21,331;00:35:23,580;as releasing me.
409;00:35:23,581;00:35:26,288;You risked your life,
409;00:35:23,581;00:35:26,288;your position, everything.
410;00:35:26,289;00:35:28,955;Why? You're not family.
410;00:35:26,289;00:35:28,955;You owe me nothing.
411;00:35:28,956;00:35:30,538;I didn't do it for you.
412;00:35:30,539;00:35:33,580;I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
413;00:35:33,581;00:35:36,830;A drunken dwarf will never be the savior
413;00:35:33,581;00:35:36,830;of the Seven Kingdoms.
414;00:35:36,831;00:35:39,080;I don't believe in saviors.
415;00:35:39,081;00:35:42,456;I believe men of talent
415;00:35:39,081;00:35:42,456;have a part to play in the war to come.
416;00:35:44,247;00:35:45,871;You're going to have
416;00:35:44,247;00:35:45,871;to find another soldier.
417;00:35:45,872;00:35:49,955;I'm done with Westeros
417;00:35:45,872;00:35:49,955;and Westeros is done with me.
418;00:35:49,956;00:35:53,163;You have many
418;00:35:49,956;00:35:53,163;admirable qualities,
419;00:35:53,164;00:35:54,538;self-pity is not
419;00:35:53,164;00:35:54,538;one of them.
420;00:35:54,539;00:35:56,830;Any fool with a bit of luck
421;00:35:56,831;00:36:00,371;can find himself
421;00:35:56,831;00:36:00,371;born into power.
422;00:36:00,372;00:36:04,038;But earning it for yourself,
422;00:36:00,372;00:36:04,038;that takes work.
423;00:36:04,039;00:36:06,580;I'm not well-suited
423;00:36:04,039;00:36:06,580;for work.
424;00:36:06,581;00:36:08,205;I think you are.
425;00:36:08,206;00:36:10,288;You have your father's
425;00:36:08,206;00:36:10,288;instincts for politics.
426;00:36:10,289;00:36:11,871;And you have compassion.
427;00:36:11,872;00:36:15,080;Compassion? Yes.
428;00:36:15,081;00:36:17,705;I killed my lover
428;00:36:15,081;00:36:17,705;with my bare hands.
429;00:36:17,706;00:36:21,496;I shot my own father
429;00:36:17,706;00:36:21,496;with a crossbow.
430;00:36:21,497;00:36:23,538;I never said you were perfect.
431;00:36:23,539;00:36:27,496;What is it you want exactly?
432;00:36:27,497;00:36:29,496;Peace.
433;00:36:29,497;00:36:30,955;Prosperity.
434;00:36:30,956;00:36:35,038;A land where the powerful
434;00:36:30,956;00:36:35,038;do not prey on the powerless.
435;00:36:35,039;00:36:37,496;Where the castles
435;00:36:35,039;00:36:37,496;are made of gingerbread
436;00:36:37,497;00:36:39,996;and the moats are filled
436;00:36:37,497;00:36:39,996;with blackberry wine.
437;00:36:39,997;00:36:42,288;The powerful have always
437;00:36:39,997;00:36:42,288;preyed on the powerless.
438;00:36:42,289;00:36:44,705;That's how they became powerful
438;00:36:42,289;00:36:44,705;in the first place.
439;00:36:44,706;00:36:46,621;Perhaps.
440;00:36:46,622;00:36:50,205;And perhaps we've grown
440;00:36:46,622;00:36:50,205;so used to horror,
441;00:36:50,206;00:36:51,831;we assume there's no other way.
442;00:36:52,914;00:36:55,621;If you sat on the Iron Throne,
443;00:36:55,622;00:36:57,788;would you spread misery
443;00:36:55,622;00:36:57,788;throughout the land?
444;00:36:57,789;00:37:00,205;I will never sit
444;00:36:57,789;00:37:00,205;on the Iron Throne.
445;00:37:00,206;00:37:02,621;No, you won't.
446;00:37:02,622;00:37:04,996;But you could help another
446;00:37:02,622;00:37:04,996;climb those steps
447;00:37:04,997;00:37:07,496;and take that seat.
448;00:37:07,497;00:37:10,538;The Seven Kingdoms
448;00:37:07,497;00:37:10,538;need someone stronger than Tommen,
449;00:37:10,539;00:37:12,830;but gentler than Stannis.
450;00:37:12,831;00:37:15,746;A monarch who can intimidate the
450;00:37:12,831;00:37:15,746;high lords and inspire the people.
451;00:37:15,747;00:37:19,830;A ruler loved by millions
451;00:37:15,747;00:37:19,830;with a powerful army
452;00:37:19,831;00:37:21,705;and the right family name.
453;00:37:21,706;00:37:23,996;Good luck finding him.
454;00:37:23,997;00:37:27,039;Who said anything about him?
455;00:37:30,997;00:37:33,371;You have a choice, my friend.
456;00:37:33,372;00:37:35,371;You can stay here
456;00:37:33,372;00:37:35,371;at Illyrio's palace
457;00:37:35,372;00:37:37,955;and drink yourself to death,
458;00:37:37,956;00:37:39,288;or you can ride with me
458;00:37:37,956;00:37:39,288;to Meereen,
459;00:37:39,289;00:37:41,746;meet Daenerys Targaryen,
460;00:37:41,747;00:37:44,164;and decide if the world
460;00:37:41,747;00:37:44,164;is worth fighting for.
461;00:37:45,914;00:37:50,247;Can I drink myself to death
461;00:37:45,914;00:37:50,247;on the road to Meereen?
462;00:38:00,289;00:38:03,788;When did the Unsullied
462;00:38:00,289;00:38:03,788;start patrolling the streets of Meereen?
463;00:38:03,789;00:38:06,622;Looks like your friends haven't
463;00:38:03,789;00:38:06,622;been behaving themselves.
464;00:38:08,956;00:38:12,788;Our mission to Yunkai
464;00:38:08,956;00:38:12,788;was a resounding success.
465;00:38:12,789;00:38:15,371;The Wise Masters of Yunkai
465;00:38:12,789;00:38:15,371;have agreed to cede power
466;00:38:15,372;00:38:17,246;to a council of elders
466;00:38:15,372;00:38:17,246;made up of both
467;00:38:17,247;00:38:19,663;the freed men and
467;00:38:17,247;00:38:19,663;the former slaveholders.
468;00:38:19,664;00:38:21,788;All matters of consequence will be
468;00:38:19,664;00:38:21,788;brought to you for review.
469;00:38:21,789;00:38:23,538;Good.
470;00:38:23,539;00:38:26,080;They did ask
470;00:38:23,539;00:38:26,080;for some concessions.
471;00:38:26,081;00:38:27,830;Concessions?
472;00:38:27,831;00:38:30,913;Politics is the art
472;00:38:27,831;00:38:30,913;of compromise, Your Grace.
473;00:38:30,914;00:38:33,830;I'm not a politician.
473;00:38:30,914;00:38:33,830;I'm a queen.
474;00:38:33,831;00:38:37,080;Forgive me.
474;00:38:33,831;00:38:37,080;You're right, of course.
475;00:38:37,081;00:38:41,496;Still, it's easier to rule happy
475;00:38:37,081;00:38:41,496;subjects than angry ones.
476;00:38:41,497;00:38:43,496;I don't expect
476;00:38:41,497;00:38:43,496;the Wise Masters to be happy.
477;00:38:43,497;00:38:45,871;Slavery made them rich.
477;00:38:43,497;00:38:45,871;I ended slavery.
478;00:38:45,872;00:38:48,955;They do not ask
478;00:38:45,872;00:38:48,955;for the return of slavery.
479;00:38:48,956;00:38:51,539;They ask for the reopening
479;00:38:48,956;00:38:51,539;of the fighting pits.
480;00:38:53,456;00:38:55,205;The fighting pits?
481;00:38:55,206;00:38:56,705;Where slaves fought
481;00:38:55,206;00:38:56,705;slaves to the death?
482;00:38:56,706;00:38:59,580;In the new world
482;00:38:56,706;00:38:59,580;that you've brought to us,
483;00:38:59,581;00:39:01,914;free men would fight free men.
484;00:39:03,414;00:39:04,830;The pit fighters you liberated
485;00:39:04,831;00:39:06,913;plead for this opportunity.
486;00:39:06,914;00:39:09,246;Bring some here
486;00:39:06,914;00:39:09,246;and ask them yourself.
487;00:39:09,247;00:39:10,455;No fighting pits.
488;00:39:10,456;00:39:11,788;Opening them would show
488;00:39:10,456;00:39:11,788;the people of Yunkai
489;00:39:11,789;00:39:14,746;and Meereen that you
489;00:39:11,789;00:39:14,746;respect their traditions.
490;00:39:14,747;00:39:17,163;I do not respect the tradition of
490;00:39:14,747;00:39:17,163;human cockfighting.
491;00:39:17,164;00:39:20,414;If you-- - How many times must I say no
491;00:39:17,164;00:39:20,414;before you understand?
492;00:39:22,831;00:39:26,205;Whatever he wants from me,
492;00:39:22,831;00:39:26,205;he's not going to get it.
493;00:39:26,206;00:39:28,746;If he really believes
493;00:39:26,206;00:39:28,746;I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...
494;00:39:28,747;00:39:30,913;You should reopen
494;00:39:28,747;00:39:30,913;the fighting pits.
495;00:39:30,914;00:39:33,788;What?
496;00:39:33,789;00:39:35,414;My mother was a whore.
496;00:39:33,789;00:39:35,414;I told you that.
497;00:39:37,497;00:39:40,163;She liked to drink pear brandy.
498;00:39:40,164;00:39:44,246;The older she got, the less
498;00:39:40,164;00:39:44,246;she made selling her body,
499;00:39:44,247;00:39:46,621;the more she wanted to drink.
500;00:39:46,622;00:39:49,830;So one day when I was 12,
500;00:39:46,622;00:39:49,830;she sold me to a slaver
501;00:39:49,831;00:39:52,455;she fucked the night before.
502;00:39:52,456;00:39:54,746;I'm sorry.
503;00:39:54,747;00:39:57,496;Why?
503;00:39:54,747;00:39:57,496;I was a bad child.
504;00:39:57,497;00:40:00,288;I wasn't big, but I was quick.
505;00:40:00,289;00:40:02,580;And I loved to fight.
506;00:40:02,581;00:40:04,580;So they sold me
506;00:40:02,581;00:40:04,580;to a man in Tolos
507;00:40:04,581;00:40:06,746;who trained fighters
507;00:40:04,581;00:40:06,746;for the pits.
508;00:40:06,747;00:40:09,371;I had my first match
508;00:40:06,747;00:40:09,371;when I was 16.
509;00:40:09,372;00:40:11,538;You were sold into slavery,
510;00:40:11,539;00:40:13,996;forced to fight to the death
510;00:40:11,539;00:40:13,996;for the amusement of the masters,
511;00:40:13,997;00:40:15,517;and you're defending
511;00:40:13,997;00:40:15,517;the fighting pits?
512;00:40:17,206;00:40:19,996;I'm only here
512;00:40:17,206;00:40:19,996;because of those pits.
513;00:40:19,997;00:40:22,621;I learned to fight
513;00:40:19,997;00:40:22,621;like a Dothraki screamer,
514;00:40:22,622;00:40:24,038;a Norvoshi priest,
514;00:40:22,622;00:40:24,038;a Westerosi knight.
515;00:40:24,039;00:40:26,663;Soon I was famous.
516;00:40:26,664;00:40:28,913;10,000 men and women
516;00:40:26,664;00:40:28,913;screamed my name
517;00:40:28,914;00:40:29,996;when I stepped into the pit.
518;00:40:29,997;00:40:31,496;I made so much money
518;00:40:29,997;00:40:31,496;for my master,
519;00:40:31,497;00:40:34,288;he set me free when he died.
520;00:40:34,289;00:40:36,080;I joined the Second Sons.
521;00:40:36,081;00:40:38,997;And then I met you.
522;00:40:44,497;00:40:45,830;You're the queen.
523;00:40:45,831;00:40:49,371;Everyone's too afraid
523;00:40:45,831;00:40:49,371;of you to speak truth.
524;00:40:49,372;00:40:51,955;Everyone but me.
525;00:40:51,956;00:40:56,163;You've made thousands
525;00:40:51,956;00:40:56,163;of enemies all across the world.
526;00:40:56,164;00:40:58,955;As soon as they see weakness,
527;00:40:58,956;00:41:01,205;they'll attack.
528;00:41:01,206;00:41:04,746;Show your strength here, now.
529;00:41:04,747;00:41:06,908;That's why I have the Unsullied
529;00:41:04,747;00:41:06,908;patrolling the streets.
530;00:41:09,122;00:41:12,663;Anyone with a chest
530;00:41:09,122;00:41:12,663;full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied.
531;00:41:12,664;00:41:16,413;You're not
531;00:41:12,664;00:41:16,413;the Mother of Unsullied.
532;00:41:16,414;00:41:17,574;You're the Mother of Dragons.
533;00:41:25,247;00:41:29,122;I don't want another child's bones
533;00:41:25,247;00:41:29,122;dropped at my feet.
534;00:41:30,122;00:41:32,996;No one's seen Drogon in weeks.
535;00:41:32,997;00:41:35,456;For all I know, he's flown halfway
535;00:41:32,997;00:41:35,456;across the world.
536;00:41:40,414;00:41:42,539;I can't control them anymore.
537;00:41:43,956;00:41:47,496;A dragon queen with no dragons
538;00:41:47,497;00:41:48,622;is not a queen.
539;00:42:55,039;00:42:57,331;Viserion?
540;00:42:59,331;00:43:01,206;Rhaegal?
541;00:43:13,206;00:43:14,746;Easy. Easy.
542;00:43:14,747;00:43:16,913;Easy.
543;00:43:56,331;00:43:58,538;So here we are.
544;00:43:58,539;00:43:59,622;Here we are.
545;00:44:02,414;00:44:06,205;When we first met,
545;00:44:02,414;00:44:06,205;you were my prisoner.
546;00:44:06,206;00:44:08,414;And now, for our last meeting...
547;00:44:10,747;00:44:14,205;This doesn't have to be
547;00:44:10,747;00:44:14,205;our last meeting.
548;00:44:14,206;00:44:16,622;No, but it will be.
549;00:44:19,164;00:44:21,496;You know what Stannis wants?
550;00:44:21,497;00:44:24,038;He wants me to bend the knee.
551;00:44:24,039;00:44:26,413;And he wants the free folk
551;00:44:24,039;00:44:26,413;to fight for him.
552;00:44:26,414;00:44:29,621;I'll give him this much,
553;00:44:29,622;00:44:30,955;he's bold.
554;00:44:30,956;00:44:32,496;Shouldn't a king be bold?
555;00:44:32,497;00:44:34,580;Oh, aye.
556;00:44:34,581;00:44:37,705;I respect him.
557;00:44:37,706;00:44:39,246;If he gets what he wants,
558;00:44:39,247;00:44:40,955;I expect he'll be a better ruler
558;00:44:39,247;00:44:40,955;than the fools
559;00:44:40,956;00:44:44,871;sitting on the Iron Throne
559;00:44:40,956;00:44:44,871;the last hundred years.
560;00:44:44,872;00:44:47,331;But I'll never serve him.
561;00:44:48,581;00:44:50,371;You told me you weren't
561;00:44:48,581;00:44:50,371;here to conquer.
562;00:44:50,372;00:44:51,705;You told me your people
562;00:44:50,372;00:44:51,705;have bled enough.
563;00:44:51,706;00:44:53,330;That's right.
564;00:44:53,331;00:44:56,621;I don't want them bleeding for
564;00:44:53,331;00:44:56,621;Stannis Baratheon either.
565;00:44:56,622;00:45:00,080;You spent your life convincing
565;00:44:56,622;00:45:00,080;90 clans to come together
566;00:45:00,081;00:45:01,163;for the first time in history.
567;00:45:01,164;00:45:04,330;Thenns and Hornfoots,
568;00:45:04,331;00:45:07,413;the ice-river clans,
568;00:45:04,331;00:45:07,413;even the giants.
569;00:45:07,414;00:45:10,413;A life's work uniting them.
569;00:45:07,414;00:45:10,413;You didn't do it for power.
570;00:45:10,414;00:45:13,788;You didn't do it for glory.
571;00:45:13,789;00:45:15,955;You brought them
571;00:45:13,789;00:45:15,955;together to save them
572;00:45:15,956;00:45:17,496;because none of them
572;00:45:15,956;00:45:17,496;will survive the winter,
573;00:45:17,497;00:45:19,371;not if they're north
573;00:45:17,497;00:45:19,371;of the Wall.
574;00:45:19,372;00:45:21,371;Isn't their survival
574;00:45:19,372;00:45:21,371;more important than your pride?
575;00:45:21,372;00:45:23,206;Pride?
576;00:45:25,372;00:45:27,914;Fuck my pride.
577;00:45:29,206;00:45:31,497;This isn't about that.
578;00:45:33,997;00:45:36,622;Then bend the knee
578;00:45:33,997;00:45:36,622;and save your people.
579;00:45:39,497;00:45:42,746;They followed me
579;00:45:39,497;00:45:42,746;because they respected me.
580;00:45:42,747;00:45:44,705;Because they believed in me.
581;00:45:44,706;00:45:47,080;The moment I kneel
581;00:45:44,706;00:45:47,080;for a southern king, that's all gone.
582;00:45:47,081;00:45:50,371;And how many tens of thousands
582;00:45:47,081;00:45:50,371;are out there right now?
583;00:45:50,372;00:45:53,621;How many women?
583;00:45:50,372;00:45:53,621;How many children?
584;00:45:53,622;00:45:56,663;And you won't go out and rescue
584;00:45:53,622;00:45:56,663;them because why?
585;00:45:56,664;00:45:58,871;You're afraid of looking afraid.
586;00:45:58,872;00:46:01,706;Oh, I am afraid.
587;00:46:02,331;00:46:04,497;No shame in that.
588;00:46:13,872;00:46:17,788;How will they do it?
588;00:46:13,872;00:46:17,788;Beheading?
589;00:46:17,789;00:46:19,664;Hanging?
590;00:46:22,372;00:46:24,956;They'll burn you alive.
591;00:46:29,622;00:46:31,414;Bad way to go.
592;00:46:35,539;00:46:37,371;I'll be honest with you.
593;00:46:37,372;00:46:39,371;I don't want to die.
594;00:46:39,372;00:46:41,538;And burnt to death,
595;00:46:41,539;00:46:43,496;I don't want people
595;00:46:41,539;00:46:43,496;to remember me like that,
596;00:46:43,497;00:46:45,371;scorched and screaming.
597;00:46:45,372;00:46:48,163;But it's better than betraying
598;00:46:48,164;00:46:49,871;everything I believe.
599;00:46:49,872;00:46:52,330;And what happens to your people?
600;00:46:52,331;00:46:56,080;You preserve your dignity
600;00:46:52,331;00:46:56,080;and die standing
601;00:46:56,081;00:46:58,496;and they'll sing
601;00:46:56,081;00:46:58,496;songs about you.
602;00:46:58,497;00:46:59,955;You'd rather burn than kneel.
603;00:46:59,956;00:47:01,622;The great hero.
604;00:47:04,456;00:47:07,330;Until winter comes and
604;00:47:04,456;00:47:07,330;the white walkers come for us all
605;00:47:07,331;00:47:09,997;and there's no one left to sing.
606;00:47:12,414;00:47:13,996;You're a good lad.
607;00:47:13,997;00:47:17,163;Truly you are.
608;00:47:17,164;00:47:22,205;But if you can't understand why I won't
608;00:47:17,164;00:47:22,205;enlist my people
609;00:47:22,206;00:47:24,955;in a foreigner's war,
610;00:47:24,956;00:47:26,956;there's no point explaining.
611;00:47:43,539;00:47:45,538;I think you're making
611;00:47:43,539;00:47:45,538;a terrible mistake.
612;00:47:47,372;00:47:49,913;The freedom to make
612;00:47:47,372;00:47:49,913;my own mistakes
613;00:47:49,914;00:47:51,581;was all I ever wanted.
614;00:49:01,289;00:49:04,913;Mance Rayder, you've been called
614;00:49:01,289;00:49:04,913;the King-beyond-the-Wall.
615;00:49:04,914;00:49:07,663;Westeros only has one king.
616;00:49:07,664;00:49:09,997;Bend the knee,
616;00:49:07,664;00:49:09,997;I promise you mercy.
617;00:49:23,539;00:49:25,664;Kneel and live.
618;00:49:33,039;00:49:36,831;This was my home for many years.
619;00:49:38,581;00:49:40,163;I wish you good fortune
620;00:49:40,164;00:49:42,831;in the wars to come.
621;00:50:24,206;00:50:27,246;We all must choose.
622;00:50:27,247;00:50:31,830;Man or woman, young or old,
623;00:50:31,831;00:50:35,246;lord or peasant,
623;00:50:31,831;00:50:35,246;our choices are the same.
624;00:50:35,247;00:50:38,746;We choose light
624;00:50:35,247;00:50:38,746;or we choose darkness.
625;00:50:38,747;00:50:41,788;We choose good
625;00:50:38,747;00:50:41,788;or we choose evil.
626;00:50:41,789;00:50:46,497;We choose the true god
626;00:50:41,789;00:50:46,497;or the false.
627;00:50:57,456;00:50:59,371;Free folk,
628;00:50:59,372;00:51:01,788;there is only one true king
629;00:51:01,789;00:51:04,913;and his name is Stannis.
630;00:51:04,914;00:51:07,371;Here stands your king of lies.
631;00:51:07,372;00:51:10,497;Behold the fate of those
631;00:51:07,372;00:51:10,497;who choose the darkness.
