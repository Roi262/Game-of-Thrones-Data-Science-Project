37;00:04:22,719;00:04:25,420;Your Grace, if you'd like

37;00:04:22,719;00:04:25,420;to sit, I'm sure that...

38;00:04:25,472;00:04:27,723;We've been here since midday.

39;00:04:36,516;00:04:39,852;Easterners have a difference

39;00:04:36,516;00:04:39,852;sense of time, I've often found.

40;00:04:39,854;00:04:43,856;Once I was waiting for Salladhor

40;00:04:39,854;00:04:43,856;Saan here in Braavos.

41;00:04:45,275;00:04:46,525;Together, we were going to run

42;00:04:46,576;00:04:49,077;three shiploads of the finest...

43;00:05:16,306;00:05:18,490;Welcome to the Iron Bank.

44;00:05:18,525;00:05:21,777;Please, sit.

45;00:05:44,467;00:05:46,885;What can we do

45;00:05:44,467;00:05:46,885;for you, Lord Stannis?

46;00:05:46,920;00:05:48,887;This is Stannis

46;00:05:46,920;00:05:48,887;of the House Baratheon,

47;00:05:48,922;00:05:51,156;King of the Andals

47;00:05:48,922;00:05:51,156;and the First Men,

48;00:05:51,190;00:05:54,126;Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

48;00:05:51,190;00:05:54,126;and Protector of the Realm.

49;00:05:57,981;00:06:00,315;The Iron Throne

49;00:05:57,981;00:06:00,315;is currently occupied

50;00:06:00,350;00:06:02,234;by Tommen

50;00:06:00,350;00:06:02,234;of the House Baratheon,

51;00:06:02,268;00:06:03,769;King of the Andals

51;00:06:02,268;00:06:03,769;and the First Men,

52;00:06:03,771;00:06:06,688;Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

52;00:06:03,771;00:06:06,688;and Protector of the Realm.

53;00:06:06,739;00:06:09,408;He shares no blood with me.

54;00:06:09,442;00:06:12,828;He is a bastard born of incest.

55;00:06:12,862;00:06:14,913;As was his brother before him.

56;00:06:14,948;00:06:17,699;Yes, we have heard this story.

57;00:06:17,750;00:06:20,369;It's not a story.

57;00:06:17,750;00:06:20,369;It's the truth.

58;00:06:20,420;00:06:23,755;The king's grandfather

58;00:06:20,420;00:06:23,755;tells a different story.

59;00:06:23,790;00:06:26,174;A story about a jealous uncle

60;00:06:26,209;00:06:28,410;whose attempts to usurp the

60;00:06:26,209;00:06:28,410;throne from the rightful king

61;00:06:28,444;00:06:33,382;cost the Seven Kingdoms

61;00:06:28,444;00:06:33,382;dearly in blood and gold.

62;00:06:33,433;00:06:35,133;Gold you loaned him.

63;00:06:35,135;00:06:39,371;And you feel your blood gives

63;00:06:35,135;00:06:39,371;you a claim on our gold?

64;00:06:39,405;00:06:42,024;More than any man living.

65;00:06:42,058;00:06:44,977;Across the Narrow Sea,

65;00:06:42,058;00:06:44,977;your books are filled

66;00:06:45,011;00:06:48,146;with words like

66;00:06:45,011;00:06:48,146;usurper and madman

67;00:06:48,181;00:06:50,682;and blood right.

68;00:06:50,717;00:06:53,852;Here, our books

68;00:06:50,717;00:06:53,852;are filled with numbers.

69;00:06:53,886;00:06:56,071;We prefer the stories they tell.

70;00:06:56,105;00:06:58,023;More plain.

71;00:06:58,057;00:07:01,493;Less open to interpretation.

72;00:07:03,663;00:07:06,615;How many fighting men

72;00:07:03,663;00:07:06,615;remain loyal to you?

73;00:07:06,649;00:07:08,000;4,000.

74;00:07:08,051;00:07:10,002;And how many ships do you have?

75;00:07:10,053;00:07:12,304;The ones still afloat,

75;00:07:10,053;00:07:12,304;Ser Davos,

76;00:07:12,338;00:07:14,806;not at the bottom

76;00:07:12,338;00:07:14,806;of Blackwater Bay.

77;00:07:16,426;00:07:18,176;32.

78;00:07:18,227;00:07:19,978;And how much wheat

78;00:07:18,227;00:07:19,978;and barley and beef

79;00:07:20,013;00:07:22,347;and pork do you produce

79;00:07:20,013;00:07:22,347;on Dragonstone

80;00:07:22,349;00:07:27,135;to feed your 4,000 men

80;00:07:22,349;00:07:27,135;on your 32 ships?

81;00:07:29,322;00:07:31,156;None.

82;00:07:31,190;00:07:34,026;You can see why these numbers

82;00:07:31,190;00:07:34,026;seem unlikely to add up

83;00:07:34,028;00:07:37,195;to a happy ending

83;00:07:34,028;00:07:37,195;from our perspective.

84;00:07:38,598;00:07:40,966;I'm afraid we must respectfully

85;00:07:41,000;00:07:44,052;decline your request.

86;00:07:44,087;00:07:47,205;But we thank you for paying

86;00:07:44,087;00:07:47,205;us the honor of your visit.

87;00:07:56,182;00:07:57,382;My lord.

88;00:07:57,433;00:08:00,135;I'm not a lord,

88;00:07:57,433;00:08:00,135;Ser Davos Seaworth.

89;00:08:00,186;00:08:02,304;You would not be either here.

90;00:08:02,338;00:08:04,256;In Braavos,

91;00:08:04,290;00:08:07,526;thieves are not

91;00:08:04,290;00:08:07,526;rewarded with titles.

92;00:08:07,560;00:08:09,061;Well, strictly speaking,

92;00:08:07,560;00:08:09,061;I didn't do the thieving.

93;00:08:09,112;00:08:10,696;That would be the pirates.

94;00:08:10,730;00:08:14,116;I just moved what they stole

94;00:08:10,730;00:08:14,116;from one place to another.

95;00:08:15,618;00:08:17,652;This is the payment

95;00:08:15,618;00:08:17,652;that was demanded

96;00:08:17,704;00:08:18,987;by King Stannis for my crimes.

97;00:08:19,038;00:08:21,406;I consider it

97;00:08:19,038;00:08:21,406;an honest accounting.

98;00:08:21,457;00:08:23,909;He's an honest man

98;00:08:21,457;00:08:23,909;and he's your best chance

99;00:08:23,960;00:08:26,411;to get back the money

99;00:08:23,960;00:08:26,411;you've sunk into Westeros.

100;00:08:26,413;00:08:29,214;Which is a lot, I imagine.

100;00:08:26,413;00:08:29,214;Wars are expensive.

101;00:08:29,315;00:08:30,582;The war is over.

102;00:08:30,584;00:08:33,085;As long as Stannis lives,

102;00:08:30,584;00:08:33,085;the war is not over.

103;00:08:33,087;00:08:35,087;Who's the real power

103;00:08:33,087;00:08:35,087;in King's Landing?

104;00:08:35,089;00:08:37,255;Ser Davos...

104;00:08:35,089;00:08:37,255;Humor me.

105;00:08:37,257;00:08:40,892;Tywin Lannister.

105;00:08:37,257;00:08:40,892;How old is Tywin Lannister?

106;00:08:40,927;00:08:44,329;67.

106;00:08:40,927;00:08:44,329;67. And when he dies, who's in command?

107;00:08:44,363;00:08:46,431;A half-grown boy,

108;00:08:46,482;00:08:48,767;the product of incest?

109;00:08:48,801;00:08:51,603;Cersei Lannister, a queen

109;00:08:48,801;00:08:51,603;whose people despise her?

110;00:08:51,605;00:08:54,306;Jaime Lannister, a man best

110;00:08:51,605;00:08:54,306;known for killing the king

111;00:08:54,340;00:08:56,441;he was sworn to protect?

112;00:08:56,476;00:09:00,112;When Tywin's gone,

112;00:08:56,476;00:09:00,112;who do you back?

113;00:09:00,163;00:09:02,781;That is a problem

113;00:09:00,163;00:09:02,781;for another time.

114;00:09:02,832;00:09:05,083;Begging your pardon,

114;00:09:02,832;00:09:05,083;I think it's a problem for now.

115;00:09:06,452;00:09:09,254;There's only one reliable

115;00:09:06,452;00:09:09,254;leader left in Westeros.

116;00:09:09,288;00:09:11,089;Stannis.

117;00:09:11,124;00:09:12,958;He's got the birthright.

118;00:09:13,009;00:09:15,127;He's in his prime.

119;00:09:15,178;00:09:16,878;He's a tried and tested

119;00:09:15,178;00:09:16,878;battle commander.

120;00:09:16,929;00:09:19,131;And he doesn't just talk

120;00:09:16,929;00:09:19,131;about paying people back,

121;00:09:19,182;00:09:20,515;he does it.

122;00:09:24,387;00:09:27,639;The lookout sees a

122;00:09:24,387;00:09:27,639;pirate ship sailing their way.

123;00:09:27,641;00:09:29,641;The captain shouts

123;00:09:27,641;00:09:29,641;to his first mate,

124;00:09:29,692;00:09:31,526;Bring me my red shirt.

125;00:09:31,561;00:09:34,529;The first mate brings the red

125;00:09:31,561;00:09:34,529;shirt and the captain puts it on.

126;00:09:34,564;00:09:36,481;And when the pirates

126;00:09:34,564;00:09:36,481;try to board,

127;00:09:36,483;00:09:38,867;the brave captain leads

127;00:09:36,483;00:09:38,867;his men to victory.

128;00:09:38,901;00:09:42,287;A few days later,

128;00:09:38,901;00:09:42,287;the lookout screams,

129;00:09:42,321;00:09:44,122;Two pirate ships!

130;00:09:44,157;00:09:47,959;The crew is shivering

130;00:09:44,157;00:09:47,959;like scared mice.

131;00:09:47,994;00:09:49,961;But the courageous

131;00:09:47,994;00:09:49,961;captain hollers,

132;00:09:49,996;00:09:51,797;Bring me my red shirt!

133;00:09:51,831;00:09:54,049;After the battle,

133;00:09:51,831;00:09:54,049;the first mate asks,

134;00:09:54,083;00:09:57,919;Captain, why do you call for

134;00:09:54,083;00:09:57,919;your red shirt before battle?

135;00:09:57,970;00:09:59,504;The captain replies,

136;00:09:59,555;00:10:03,341;So that if I am stabbed,

136;00:09:59,555;00:10:03,341;you will not see me bleed.

137;00:10:03,392;00:10:05,594;The next morning

137;00:10:03,392;00:10:05,594;the lookout screams,

138;00:10:05,645;00:10:08,096;10 pirate ships!

139;00:10:08,147;00:10:10,932;We are surrounded!

140;00:10:11,017;00:10:12,734;The crew goes silent.

141;00:10:12,768;00:10:15,270;They all look

141;00:10:12,768;00:10:15,270;to their brave captain,

142;00:10:15,321;00:10:17,405;waiting for his usual command.

143;00:10:17,440;00:10:19,441;Calm as ever,

143;00:10:17,440;00:10:19,441;the captain bellows...

144;00:10:19,492;00:10:21,860;Bring me my brown pants!

145;00:10:24,697;00:10:28,166;You think they ever met a pirate

145;00:10:24,697;00:10:28,166;who didn't tell them that joke?

146;00:10:28,201;00:10:31,620;Davos.

147;00:10:31,704;00:10:34,039;I heard you were rotting in

147;00:10:31,704;00:10:34,039;a dungeon in Dragonstone.

148;00:10:34,041;00:10:36,374;Only half rotted.

149;00:10:38,961;00:10:41,096;Join us, my friend. Join us.

150;00:10:41,130;00:10:44,049;This is Lhara.

151;00:10:44,051;00:10:45,650;And this is...

151;00:10:44,051;00:10:45,650;I am Lhara.

152;00:10:48,889;00:10:51,356;She's an artist,

152;00:10:48,889;00:10:51,356;this one, truly.

153;00:10:51,390;00:10:54,726;No time, I'm afraid.

153;00:10:51,390;00:10:54,726;We sail at sunrise.

154;00:10:54,777;00:10:56,194;We?

155;00:10:56,229;00:10:58,396;You, me... we.

156;00:11:00,566;00:11:03,735;Once I thought

156;00:11:00,566;00:11:03,735;this man loved me.

157;00:11:03,737;00:11:07,906;Now I know he despises me.

158;00:11:07,908;00:11:12,294;He wants to see me die poor

158;00:11:07,908;00:11:12,294;and alone on some cold...

159;00:11:22,255;00:11:23,922;You won't be alone.

160;00:11:23,924;00:11:25,473;And you won't be poor.

161;00:11:33,266;00:11:35,850;There's a chest of the good

161;00:11:33,266;00:11:35,850;stuff left back at your house.

162;00:11:35,902;00:11:37,769;I gave it to your wife.

163;00:11:41,073;00:11:43,441;You're not my friend, my friend.

164;00:11:45,244;00:11:47,078;I'll see you at sunrise.

165;00:11:50,082;00:11:52,334;I give you

165;00:11:50,082;00:11:52,334;until the full moon

166;00:11:52,368;00:11:55,954;to order all ironborn

166;00:11:52,368;00:11:55,954;scum out of the North

167;00:11:56,005;00:11:59,674;and back to those shit-stained

167;00:11:56,005;00:11:59,674;rocks you call home.

168;00:11:59,709;00:12:01,710;On the first night

168;00:11:59,709;00:12:01,710;of the full moon,

169;00:12:01,761;00:12:04,512;I will hunt down every

169;00:12:01,761;00:12:04,512;islander still on our lands

170;00:12:04,547;00:12:06,464;and flay them living,

171;00:12:06,466;00:12:09,134;the way I flayed

171;00:12:06,466;00:12:09,134;the 20 ironborn scum

172;00:12:09,185;00:12:10,769;I found at Winterfell.

173;00:12:12,021;00:12:14,639;In the box you'll find

173;00:12:12,021;00:12:14,639;a special gift...

174;00:12:15,691;00:12:18,143;Theon's favorite toy.

175;00:12:18,194;00:12:20,979;He cried when I took

175;00:12:18,194;00:12:20,979;it away from him.

176;00:12:22,365;00:12:25,150;Leave the North now

176;00:12:22,365;00:12:25,150;or more boxes will follow

177;00:12:25,152;00:12:27,319;with more Theon.

178;00:12:27,370;00:12:29,371;Signed Ramsay Snow,

179;00:12:29,405;00:12:32,824;natural born son

180;00:12:32,826;00:12:34,826;Lord of the Dreadfort

181;00:12:34,828;00:12:37,796;and Warden of the North.

182;00:12:37,830;00:12:39,798;Yes!

183;00:12:39,882;00:12:41,967;They skinned our countrymen

184;00:12:42,001;00:12:44,753;and they mutilated my brother,

185;00:12:44,804;00:12:47,138;your prince.

186;00:12:47,173;00:12:49,224;Your prince.

187;00:12:49,258;00:12:52,010;Everything they've done to him,

188;00:12:52,012;00:12:54,095;they've also done to you.

189;00:12:54,146;00:12:55,563;Yes! Yes!

190;00:12:55,598;00:12:59,517;As long as they can hurt

190;00:12:55,598;00:12:59,517;our prince with impunity,

191;00:12:59,519;00:13:03,521;the word ironborn means nothing.

192;00:13:27,463;00:13:29,381;Go left.

193;00:13:37,724;00:13:40,558;Theon Greyjoy.

195;00:13:41,977;00:13:43,311;Take me to the dungeons.

196;00:13:43,362;00:13:45,563;He's not in the dungeons.

197;00:14:09,922;00:14:12,090;Last cage on the right.

201;00:14:37,950;00:14:41,920;It's all right. It's me, Yara.

202;00:14:41,954;00:14:44,089;You can't trick me.

203;00:14:44,123;00:14:46,291;Tell him. Tell him you

204;00:14:46,293;00:14:48,126;I'm saving you.

205;00:14:48,128;00:14:49,511;Not Theon! Reek!

206;00:14:49,595;00:14:51,296;Reek! My name is Reek!

209;00:14:54,517;00:14:56,384;No, you can't!

210;00:14:56,435;00:14:58,186;You can't!

210;00:14:56,435;00:14:58,186;You're Theon Greyjoy.

211;00:14:58,220;00:15:02,357;No, I don't believe her!

211;00:14:58,220;00:15:02,357;I know who I am!

214;00:15:18,874;00:15:21,826;This is turning into

214;00:15:18,874;00:15:21,826;a lovely evening.

215;00:15:38,227;00:15:39,727;I'm Reek!

219;00:16:12,476;00:16:16,345;But with those big balls

219;00:16:12,476;00:16:16,345;of yours...

220;00:16:21,351;00:16:23,519;how fast can you run?

224;00:16:48,295;00:16:51,180;I have a treat for you.

225;00:16:51,215;00:16:52,882;A reward.

226;00:16:52,933;00:16:55,468;Reward?

227;00:16:56,603;00:16:57,770;Yes, Reek.

228;00:16:57,805;00:17:00,723;Those creatures

228;00:16:57,805;00:17:00,723;who came in the night,

229;00:17:00,725;00:17:03,392;they wanted to take you away.

230;00:17:03,394;00:17:05,361;And you didn't let them.

231;00:17:05,395;00:17:07,797;You remained loyal.

232;00:17:07,831;00:17:11,734;I... I didn't want

232;00:17:07,831;00:17:11,734;them to take me.

233;00:17:13,070;00:17:14,487;I was so scared.

234;00:17:14,538;00:17:16,823;I didn't want them...

234;00:17:14,538;00:17:16,823;Yes, yes, Reek.

235;00:17:25,833;00:17:28,050;It's a bath.

236;00:17:28,085;00:17:30,419;For you.

237;00:17:33,590;00:17:36,142;Remove those rags.

238;00:17:37,344;00:17:39,178;Now.

239;00:17:55,829;00:17:57,780;The britches, too, Reek.

240;00:17:57,831;00:17:59,448;Take them off.

241;00:19:25,702;00:19:28,371;Do you love me, Reek?

242;00:19:34,261;00:19:36,879;Yes, of course, my lord.

243;00:19:38,632;00:19:40,132;Good.

244;00:19:40,183;00:19:42,518;Because I need you

244;00:19:40,183;00:19:42,518;to do something for me.

245;00:19:42,552;00:19:44,604;Something very important.

246;00:19:44,638;00:19:47,890;There's a castle, you see.

247;00:19:47,941;00:19:51,027;Some bad men hold this castle.

248;00:19:52,396;00:19:55,231;I need your help

248;00:19:52,396;00:19:55,231;to take this castle back.

249;00:19:58,785;00:20:00,536;But how can...

250;00:20:02,906;00:20:05,074;I need you to play a role.

251;00:20:06,243;00:20:09,161;To pretend to be someone

251;00:20:06,243;00:20:09,161;you're not.

252;00:20:12,749;00:20:14,917;Pretend to be who?

253;00:20:14,919;00:20:17,753;Theon Greyjoy.

254;00:21:26,323;00:21:27,323;_

255;00:21:30,983;00:21:32,505;_

258;00:21:35,394;00:21:37,744;_

259;00:21:38,004;00:21:40,149;_

260;00:21:40,269;00:21:43,876;_

261;00:21:44,492;00:21:46,924;_

262;00:21:49,163;00:21:51,296;_

263;00:22:04,244;00:22:05,644;He is a goatherd.

264;00:22:05,679;00:22:09,215;He says he prayed for your victory

264;00:22:05,679;00:22:09,215;against the slave masters.

265;00:22:09,249;00:22:11,851;I thank him for his prayers.

266;00:22:27,384;00:22:29,351;It was your dragons, he says.

267;00:22:29,386;00:22:32,938;They came this morning

267;00:22:29,386;00:22:32,938;for his flock.

268;00:22:36,993;00:22:39,061;He hopes he has not

268;00:22:36,993;00:22:39,061;offended Your Grace,

269;00:22:39,096;00:22:40,729;but now he has nothing.

270;00:22:42,149;00:22:43,949;Tell this man I am sorry

270;00:22:42,149;00:22:43,949;for his hardship.

271;00:22:43,984;00:22:47,803;I cannot bring back his goats,

272;00:22:47,838;00:22:52,658;but I will see he is paid

272;00:22:47,838;00:22:52,658;their value three times over.

273;00:23:09,059;00:23:11,260;Send the next one in.

274;00:23:19,113;00:23:20,113;_

275;00:23:25,443;00:23:26,443;_

277;00:23:46,963;00:23:49,014;Tales of your beauty

277;00:23:46,963;00:23:49,014;were not exaggerated.

278;00:23:49,049;00:23:51,100;I thank you.

279;00:23:51,134;00:23:54,136;Mine is one of the oldest and

279;00:23:51,134;00:23:54,136;proudest families in Meereen.

280;00:23:54,171;00:23:56,805;Then it is my honor

280;00:23:54,171;00:23:56,805;to receive you.

281;00:23:56,840;00:23:59,775;My father, one of

281;00:23:56,840;00:23:59,775;Meereen's most respected

282;00:23:59,809;00:24:02,778;and beloved citizens,

282;00:23:59,809;00:24:02,778;oversaw the restoration

283;00:24:02,812;00:24:05,114;and maintenance

283;00:24:02,812;00:24:05,114;of its greatest landmarks.

284;00:24:05,148;00:24:06,665;This pyramid included.

285;00:24:06,700;00:24:08,868;For that, he has my gratitude.

286;00:24:08,902;00:24:10,569;I should be honored to meet him.

287;00:24:10,604;00:24:12,054;You have, Your Grace.

288;00:24:12,088;00:24:13,889;You crucified him.

289;00:24:16,126;00:24:18,160;I pray you'll never live to see

290;00:24:18,211;00:24:20,162;a member of your family

290;00:24:18,211;00:24:20,162;treated so cruelly.

291;00:24:20,213;00:24:23,732;Your father crucified

291;00:24:20,213;00:24:23,732;innocent children.

292;00:24:23,800;00:24:27,219;My father spoke out against

292;00:24:23,800;00:24:27,219;crucifying those children.

293;00:24:27,254;00:24:30,456;He decried it as a criminal

293;00:24:27,254;00:24:30,456;act, but was overruled.

294;00:24:30,490;00:24:33,826;Is it justice to answer

294;00:24:30,490;00:24:33,826;one crime with another?

295;00:24:33,894;00:24:36,312;I am sorry you no longer

295;00:24:33,894;00:24:36,312;have a father,

296;00:24:36,346;00:24:39,682;but my treatment

296;00:24:36,346;00:24:39,682;of the masters was no crime.

297;00:24:39,733;00:24:42,501;You'd be wise to remember that.

298;00:24:42,535;00:24:45,487;What's done is done.

299;00:24:45,522;00:24:48,657;You are the queen and I

299;00:24:45,522;00:24:48,657;am a servant of Meereen.

300;00:24:48,692;00:24:52,361;A servant who does not wish to

300;00:24:48,692;00:24:52,361;see its traditions eradicated.

301;00:24:52,363;00:24:55,197;And what traditions

301;00:24:52,363;00:24:55,197;do you speak of?

302;00:24:55,199;00:24:57,199;The tradition of funeral rite.

303;00:24:57,250;00:24:59,535;Proper burial in

303;00:24:57,250;00:24:59,535;the Temple of the Graces.

304;00:24:59,586;00:25:04,123;My father and 162

304;00:24:59,586;00:25:04,123;noble Meereenese

305;00:25:04,174;00:25:06,508;are still nailed to those posts,

306;00:25:06,543;00:25:09,712;carrion for vultures,

306;00:25:06,543;00:25:09,712;rotting in the sun.

307;00:25:18,922;00:25:21,774;Your Grace, I ask that you

307;00:25:18,922;00:25:21,774;order these men taken down

308;00:25:21,808;00:25:24,026;so that they might receive

308;00:25:21,808;00:25:24,026;proper burials.

309;00:25:24,060;00:25:28,230;And what of the slave children

309;00:25:24,060;00:25:28,230;these noble Meereenese crucified?

310;00:25:28,232;00:25:30,733;They were rotting

310;00:25:28,232;00:25:30,733;in the sun as well.

311;00:25:30,735;00:25:34,403;Would you have begged me for

311;00:25:30,735;00:25:34,403;their right to a proper burial?

312;00:25:34,454;00:25:37,156;Your Grace, I cannot defend

312;00:25:34,454;00:25:37,156;the actions of the masters.

313;00:25:37,240;00:25:41,126;I can only speak to you as a

313;00:25:37,240;00:25:41,126;son who loved his father.

314;00:25:41,161;00:25:43,412;Let me take his body down.

315;00:25:43,414;00:25:46,298;Let me have him brought

315;00:25:43,414;00:25:46,298;to the temple

316;00:25:46,333;00:25:47,833;and buried with dignity

317;00:25:47,884;00:25:50,252;so that he might find

317;00:25:47,884;00:25:50,252;peace in the next world.

318;00:25:53,490;00:25:57,142;Bury your father,

318;00:25:53,490;00:25:57,142;Hizdahr zo Loraq.

319;00:26:00,930;00:26:04,149;Thank you, my queen.

320;00:26:15,695;00:26:17,129;How many more?

321;00:26:17,163;00:26:20,449;There are 212 supplicants

321;00:26:17,163;00:26:20,449;waiting, Your Grace.

322;00:26:20,533;00:26:23,285;212?

323;00:26:30,760;00:26:33,262;Send the next one in.

324;00:26:35,181;00:26:37,883;These meetings aren't always going

324;00:26:35,181;00:26:37,883;to be this early, are they?

325;00:26:37,934;00:26:41,020;I was up late last night.

326;00:26:41,054;00:26:45,057;So, does this mean I am a

326;00:26:41,054;00:26:45,057;master of something now?

327;00:26:45,108;00:26:46,975;Coins, ships?

328;00:26:46,977;00:26:49,228;Lord Tywin and I

328;00:26:46,977;00:26:49,228;already determined

329;00:26:49,279;00:26:52,481;that I shall be the Master

329;00:26:49,279;00:26:52,481;of Ships long before you...

330;00:26:57,320;00:26:59,488;Lord Tywin, it's a great honor

331;00:26:59,539;00:27:01,990;to have been granted a

331;00:26:59,539;00:27:01,990;seat on this council. I...

332;00:27:01,992;00:27:03,992;The trial

332;00:27:01,992;00:27:03,992;begins this afternoon.

333;00:27:04,044;00:27:06,211;We only have the morning

333;00:27:04,044;00:27:06,211;for affairs of state.

334;00:27:06,246;00:27:07,713;Shall we begin?

335;00:27:07,747;00:27:09,748;Sandor Clegane

335;00:27:07,747;00:27:09,748;has been spotted

336;00:27:09,799;00:27:12,584;in the Riverlands, my lord.

337;00:27:12,635;00:27:13,969;A coward and a traitor.

338;00:27:14,003;00:27:18,257;My birds tell me the Hound

338;00:27:14,003;00:27:18,257;slaughtered five of our soldiers.

339;00:27:18,308;00:27:21,009;I believe the phrase

339;00:27:18,308;00:27:21,009;fuck the king was uttered.

340;00:27:21,011;00:27:22,811;Disgraceful.

341;00:27:22,846;00:27:24,680;What would it take

341;00:27:22,846;00:27:24,680;to make the common soldier

342;00:27:24,682;00:27:26,982;stupid enough to try

342;00:27:24,682;00:27:26,982;his luck with the Hound?

343;00:27:27,016;00:27:29,585;10 silver stags

343;00:27:27,016;00:27:29,585;seems a generous bounty.

344;00:27:29,619;00:27:32,438;Make it 100. What else?

345;00:27:32,489;00:27:35,023;More whispers

345;00:27:32,489;00:27:35,023;from the east, my lord.

346;00:27:35,075;00:27:36,608;The Targaryen girl?

347;00:27:36,659;00:27:39,445;Daenerys has taken up

347;00:27:36,659;00:27:39,445;residence in Meereen.

348;00:27:39,496;00:27:43,098;She has conquered the city

348;00:27:39,496;00:27:43,098;and rules as its queen.

349;00:27:43,133;00:27:44,700;Conquered with what?

350;00:27:44,751;00:27:46,668;She commands an army

350;00:27:44,751;00:27:46,668;of Unsullied, my queen.

351;00:27:46,703;00:27:48,704;Some 8,000 strong.

352;00:27:48,738;00:27:51,039;She has a company

352;00:27:48,738;00:27:51,039;of sellswords...

353;00:27:51,041;00:27:52,424;the Second Sons.

354;00:27:52,459;00:27:54,877;She has two knights

354;00:27:52,459;00:27:54,877;advising her...

355;00:27:54,911;00:27:58,180;Jorah Mormont

355;00:27:54,911;00:27:58,180;and Barristan Selmy.

356;00:27:58,214;00:28:00,215;And she has three dragons.

357;00:28:00,266;00:28:01,683;Baby dragons.

358;00:28:01,718;00:28:03,852;Larger every year, Your Grace.

359;00:28:03,887;00:28:07,356;Mormont is spying on her for us.

360;00:28:07,390;00:28:10,359;No longer. He appears

360;00:28:07,390;00:28:10,359;to be fully devoted to her.

361;00:28:10,393;00:28:13,395;As for Ser Barristan,

361;00:28:10,393;00:28:13,395;it would seem

362;00:28:13,430;00:28:16,064;he took his dismissal

362;00:28:13,430;00:28:16,064;from the Kingsguard

363;00:28:16,066;00:28:17,900;a bit harder than anticipated.

364;00:28:17,902;00:28:19,818;He's an old man.

365;00:28:19,869;00:28:21,770;He wasn't fit to protect my son.

366;00:28:21,805;00:28:23,822;Joffrey didn't die on his watch.

367;00:28:23,873;00:28:27,159;Dismissing him was as

367;00:28:23,873;00:28:27,159;insulting as it was stupid.

368;00:28:27,210;00:28:30,312;Don't tell me you're worried about

368;00:28:27,210;00:28:30,312;a child halfway across the world.

369;00:28:30,346;00:28:33,916;A child with two seasoned

369;00:28:30,346;00:28:33,916;warriors counseling her

370;00:28:33,950;00:28:37,169;and a powerful army

370;00:28:33,950;00:28:37,169;at her back, Your Grace.

371;00:28:37,220;00:28:39,254;Lord Varys is right.

372;00:28:39,256;00:28:41,757;I have been to Essos and seen

372;00:28:39,256;00:28:41,757;the Unsullied firsthand.

373;00:28:41,808;00:28:45,327;They are very impressive

373;00:28:41,808;00:28:45,327;on the battlefield.

374;00:28:45,361;00:28:47,095;Less so in the bedroom.

375;00:28:47,097;00:28:49,932;Dragons haven't won

375;00:28:47,097;00:28:49,932;a war in 300 years.

376;00:28:49,934;00:28:52,484;Armies win them all the time.

377;00:28:52,519;00:28:54,770;She must be dealt with.

378;00:28:54,804;00:28:56,822;How, my lord?

379;00:28:56,856;00:28:58,190;By force?

380;00:28:58,241;00:29:00,259;Eventually, if it comes to that.

381;00:29:02,412;00:29:05,364;Can your little birds

381;00:29:02,412;00:29:05,364;find their way into Meereen?

382;00:29:05,398;00:29:07,416;Most certainly, my Lord Hand.

383;00:29:07,450;00:29:10,369;Mmm. Lord Tyrell,

383;00:29:07,450;00:29:10,369;be a good man.

384;00:29:10,420;00:29:12,120;Fetch my quill and paper.

385;00:29:33,026;00:29:35,194;Prince Oberyn.

386;00:29:35,228;00:29:37,646;Lord Varys...

387;00:29:37,648;00:29:40,883;Only Varys.

387;00:29:37,648;00:29:40,883;I'm not actually a nobleman.

388;00:29:40,917;00:29:43,452;No one is under obligation

388;00:29:40,917;00:29:43,452;to call me lord.

389;00:29:43,486;00:29:45,320;And yet everyone does.

390;00:29:47,824;00:29:50,292;You seem quite knowledgeable

390;00:29:47,824;00:29:50,292;about the Unsullied.

391;00:29:50,326;00:29:52,244;Did you spend much time

391;00:29:50,326;00:29:52,244;in Essos?

392;00:29:52,328;00:29:54,963;Five years.

393;00:29:54,998;00:29:56,582;May I ask why?

394;00:29:56,633;00:29:59,468;'Tis a big and beautiful world.

395;00:29:59,502;00:30:02,170;Most of us live and die

396;00:30:02,172;00:30:03,889;in the same corner

396;00:30:02,172;00:30:03,889;where we were born

397;00:30:03,923;00:30:06,842;and never get to see any of it.

398;00:30:06,844;00:30:09,478;I don't want to be most of us.

399;00:30:09,512;00:30:11,513;Most of us aren't princes.

400;00:30:12,882;00:30:16,351;You are from Essos.

401;00:30:17,570;00:30:19,238;Where? Lys?

402;00:30:20,557;00:30:22,274;I have an ear for accents.

403;00:30:22,325;00:30:23,992;I've lost my accent entirely.

404;00:30:24,027;00:30:25,527;I have an ear for that as well.

405;00:30:27,413;00:30:29,581;How did you get here?

406;00:30:29,616;00:30:31,199;It's a long story.

407;00:30:31,284;00:30:34,202;One you don't like

407;00:30:31,284;00:30:34,202;telling people.

408;00:30:34,254;00:30:36,872;People I trust.

409;00:30:36,874;00:30:39,958;My paramour Ellaria, she would

409;00:30:36,874;00:30:39,958;find you very interesting.

410;00:30:40,009;00:30:42,294;You should come to

410;00:30:40,009;00:30:42,294;the brothel and meet her.

411;00:30:42,345;00:30:45,380;We brought our own wine, not

411;00:30:42,345;00:30:45,380;the swill they serve here.

412;00:30:45,382;00:30:48,550;We have some lovely

412;00:30:45,382;00:30:48,550;boys on retainer, but...

413;00:30:51,454;00:30:53,855;You did like boys before?

414;00:30:55,942;00:30:57,809;Really?

415;00:30:57,860;00:30:59,728;Girls? Hmm.

416;00:30:59,730;00:31:02,397;I hope you won't be offended when

416;00:30:59,730;00:31:02,397;I say I never would have guessed.

417;00:31:02,448;00:31:03,899;Not at all.

418;00:31:03,901;00:31:06,735;But I was never interested

418;00:31:03,901;00:31:06,735;in girls, either.

419;00:31:06,786;00:31:09,204;What then?

419;00:31:06,786;00:31:09,204;Nothing.

420;00:31:09,238;00:31:12,040;Everybody is interested

420;00:31:09,238;00:31:12,040;in something.

421;00:31:12,075;00:31:13,825;Not me.

422;00:31:13,876;00:31:16,078;When I see what

422;00:31:13,876;00:31:16,078;desire does to people,

423;00:31:16,080;00:31:18,046;what it's done to this country,

424;00:31:18,081;00:31:20,916;I am very glad

424;00:31:18,081;00:31:20,916;to have no part in it.

425;00:31:22,051;00:31:25,387;Besides, the absence of desire

426;00:31:25,421;00:31:28,507;leaves one free to pursue

426;00:31:25,421;00:31:28,507;other things.

427;00:31:28,558;00:31:30,225;Such as?

428;00:32:05,345;00:32:08,430;Let me guess,

428;00:32:05,345;00:32:08,430;I've been pardoned.

429;00:32:24,647;00:32:26,481;Really?

430;00:32:27,984;00:32:29,484;Father's orders.

431;00:32:29,535;00:32:33,321;Well, we mustn't

431;00:32:29,535;00:32:33,321;disappoint Father.

432;00:32:43,700;00:32:45,667;Kingslayer!

433;00:33:31,631;00:33:34,800;I, Tommen

433;00:33:31,631;00:33:34,800;of the House Baratheon,

434;00:33:34,851;00:33:36,551;First of my Name,

435;00:33:36,602;00:33:38,887;King of the Andals

435;00:33:36,602;00:33:38,887;and the First Men,

436;00:33:38,938;00:33:41,556;and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,

437;00:33:41,558;00:33:45,310;do hereby recuse myself

437;00:33:41,558;00:33:45,310;from this trial.

438;00:33:45,361;00:33:48,480;Tywin of the House Lannister,

438;00:33:45,361;00:33:48,480;Hand of the King,

439;00:33:48,531;00:33:52,417;Protector of the Realm,

439;00:33:48,531;00:33:52,417;will sit as judge in my stead.

440;00:33:53,736;00:33:56,371;And with him Prince Oberyn

440;00:33:53,736;00:33:56,371;of the House Martell

441;00:33:56,405;00:33:59,691;and Lord Mace

441;00:33:56,405;00:33:59,691;of the House Tyrell.

442;00:33:59,725;00:34:02,077;And if found guilty...

443;00:34:04,247;00:34:05,997;may the gods punish the accused.

444;00:34:41,617;00:34:44,002;Tyrion of the House Lannister,

445;00:34:44,036;00:34:48,123;you stand accused by

445;00:34:44,036;00:34:48,123;the Queen Regent of regicide.

446;00:34:49,425;00:34:51,793;Did you kill King Joffrey?

447;00:34:53,129;00:34:54,429;No.

448;00:34:54,463;00:34:56,798;Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?

449;00:34:56,800;00:34:59,267;Not that I know of.

450;00:34:59,302;00:35:02,604;How would you say he died, then?

451;00:35:02,638;00:35:04,806;Choked on his pigeon pie.

452;00:35:06,275;00:35:08,276;So you would blame the bakers?

453;00:35:08,311;00:35:10,695;Or the pigeons.

453;00:35:08,311;00:35:10,695;Just leave me out of it.

454;00:35:12,698;00:35:16,651;The crown may call

454;00:35:12,698;00:35:16,651;its first witness.

455;00:35:16,653;00:35:18,820;Once we'd got

455;00:35:16,653;00:35:18,820;King Joffrey safely away

456;00:35:18,822;00:35:20,822;from the mob,

456;00:35:18,822;00:35:20,822;the Imp rounded on him.

457;00:35:20,824;00:35:23,158;He slapped the king

457;00:35:20,824;00:35:23,158;across the face

458;00:35:23,209;00:35:25,660;and called him a vicious

458;00:35:23,209;00:35:25,660;idiot and a fool.

459;00:35:27,380;00:35:29,464;It wasn't the first time

459;00:35:27,380;00:35:29,464;the Imp threatened Joffrey.

460;00:35:29,498;00:35:31,383;Right here in this throne room,

461;00:35:31,417;00:35:34,302;he marched up those steps

461;00:35:31,417;00:35:34,302;and called our king a halfwit.

462;00:35:34,337;00:35:36,638;Compared His Grace

462;00:35:34,337;00:35:36,638;to the Mad King

463;00:35:36,672;00:35:38,506;and suggested he'd meet

463;00:35:36,672;00:35:38,506;the same fate.

464;00:35:38,508;00:35:40,342;And when I spoke

464;00:35:38,508;00:35:40,342;in the king's defense,

465;00:35:40,344;00:35:42,677;he threatened to have me killed.

466;00:35:42,728;00:35:44,729;Oh, why don't you tell

466;00:35:42,728;00:35:44,729;them what Joffrey was doing?

467;00:35:44,764;00:35:47,566;- Silence.

467;00:35:44,764;00:35:47,566;Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark

468;00:35:47,600;00:35:49,240;while you tore at her

468;00:35:47,600;00:35:49,240;clothes and beat her.

469;00:35:49,268;00:35:51,987;Silence!

470;00:35:52,021;00:35:55,907;You will not speak

470;00:35:52,021;00:35:55,907;unless called upon.

471;00:35:57,243;00:35:59,444;You're dismissed, Ser Meryn.

472;00:36:05,868;00:36:08,536;Basilisk venom,

473;00:36:08,588;00:36:11,089;widow's blood,

474;00:36:11,123;00:36:13,375;wolfsbane,

475;00:36:13,377;00:36:15,594;essence of nightshade,

476;00:36:15,628;00:36:18,513;sweetsleep,

477;00:36:18,547;00:36:20,632;tears of Lys,

478;00:36:20,683;00:36:22,884;demon's dance...

479;00:36:25,104;00:36:26,638;blind eye...

480;00:36:26,689;00:36:28,890;I think you have made your

480;00:36:26,689;00:36:28,890;point, Grand Maester.

481;00:36:28,892;00:36:30,725;You have a lot of poison

481;00:36:28,892;00:36:30,725;in your store.

482;00:36:30,776;00:36:32,777;Had, Prince Oberyn.

483;00:36:32,812;00:36:35,730;My stores were plundered.

484;00:36:35,732;00:36:37,065;By whom?

485;00:36:37,067;00:36:39,951;By the accused,

485;00:36:37,067;00:36:39,951;Tyrion Lannister,

486;00:36:40,036;00:36:42,404;after he had me

486;00:36:40,036;00:36:42,404;wrongfully imprisoned.

487;00:36:42,406;00:36:44,906;Grand Maester,

488;00:36:44,957;00:36:47,959;you examined

488;00:36:44,957;00:36:47,959;King Joffrey's corpse.

489;00:36:47,994;00:36:52,297;Was it without question

489;00:36:47,994;00:36:52,297;poison that killed him?

490;00:36:52,331;00:36:54,883;Without question.

491;00:36:57,219;00:37:00,755;This was found on the body

491;00:36:57,219;00:37:00,755;of Dontos Hollard,

492;00:37:00,840;00:37:02,374;the king's fool.

493;00:37:02,408;00:37:06,428;He was last seen

493;00:37:02,408;00:37:06,428;spiriting Sansa Stark,

494;00:37:06,479;00:37:10,231;the wife of the accused,

494;00:37:06,479;00:37:10,231;away from the feast.

495;00:37:10,266;00:37:13,685;She wore this necklace

496;00:37:13,736;00:37:15,937;the day of the wedding.

497;00:37:15,939;00:37:19,240;Residue of a most rare

498;00:37:19,275;00:37:23,244;and terrible poison

498;00:37:19,275;00:37:23,244;was found inside.

499;00:37:23,279;00:37:27,248;Was this one of the poisons

499;00:37:23,279;00:37:27,248;stolen from your store?

500;00:37:27,283;00:37:30,335;It was. The Strangler.

501;00:37:30,369;00:37:34,205;A poison few in

501;00:37:30,369;00:37:34,205;the Seven Kingdoms possess.

502;00:37:34,240;00:37:38,843;And used to strike down

502;00:37:34,240;00:37:38,843;the most noble child

503;00:37:38,878;00:37:41,680;the gods ever put

503;00:37:38,878;00:37:41,680;on this good earth.

504;00:37:49,572;00:37:51,890;I will hurt you for this.

505;00:37:51,941;00:37:54,693;A day will come when you

505;00:37:51,941;00:37:54,693;think you are safe and happy

506;00:37:54,727;00:37:57,145;and your joy will turn

506;00:37:54,727;00:37:57,145;to ashes in your mouth

507;00:37:57,147;00:37:59,314;and you will know

507;00:37:57,147;00:37:59,314;the debt is paid.

508;00:37:59,316;00:38:02,951;Your own brother

508;00:37:59,316;00:38:02,951;said this to you?

509;00:38:04,236;00:38:07,122;Shortly before the Battle

509;00:38:04,236;00:38:07,122;of Blackwater Bay.

510;00:38:07,156;00:38:11,376;I confronted him about his plans

510;00:38:07,156;00:38:11,376;to put Joffrey on the front lines.

511;00:38:13,913;00:38:15,647;As it turned out,

511;00:38:13,913;00:38:15,647;when the attack came,

512;00:38:15,681;00:38:17,999;Joff insisted on remaining

512;00:38:15,681;00:38:17,999;at the battlements.

513;00:38:18,001;00:38:21,920;He believed his presence

513;00:38:18,001;00:38:21,920;would inspire the troops.

514;00:38:23,172;00:38:25,006;Tyrion said,

515;00:38:25,057;00:38:27,726;And you will know

515;00:38:25,057;00:38:27,726;the debt is paid.

516;00:38:27,760;00:38:30,028;What debt?

517;00:38:31,480;00:38:33,014;I discovered

517;00:38:31,480;00:38:33,014;he'd been keeping whores

518;00:38:33,016;00:38:34,849;in the Tower of the Hand.

519;00:38:34,851;00:38:37,352;I asked him to confine

519;00:38:34,851;00:38:37,352;his salacious acts

520;00:38:37,403;00:38:40,021;to the brothel

520;00:38:37,403;00:38:40,021;where such behavior belongs.

521;00:38:40,023;00:38:41,990;He wasn't pleased.

522;00:38:44,610;00:38:46,745;Thank you, Your Grace,

523;00:38:46,779;00:38:49,080;for the courage

523;00:38:46,779;00:38:49,080;of your testimony.

524;00:39:04,713;00:39:07,132;Do you remember the

524;00:39:04,713;00:39:07,132;precise nature of this threat?

525;00:39:07,183;00:39:09,717;I'm afraid I do, my lord.

526;00:39:09,769;00:39:13,721;He said,  Perhaps you should

526;00:39:09,769;00:39:13,721;speak more softly to me, then.

527;00:39:13,723;00:39:15,640;Monsters are dangerous

528;00:39:15,691;00:39:18,109;and just now kings

528;00:39:15,691;00:39:18,109;are dying like flies.

529;00:39:18,144;00:39:21,446;And he said this to you at a

529;00:39:18,144;00:39:21,446;meeting of the small council?

530;00:39:21,480;00:39:22,730;Yes.

531;00:39:22,732;00:39:25,867;After we received word

531;00:39:22,732;00:39:25,867;of Robb Stark's death.

532;00:39:25,901;00:39:28,153;He didn't seem gladdened

532;00:39:25,901;00:39:28,153;by the news.

533;00:39:28,204;00:39:30,655;Perhaps his marriage

533;00:39:28,204;00:39:30,655;to Sansa Stark

534;00:39:30,706;00:39:33,124;had made him more sympathetic

534;00:39:30,706;00:39:33,124;to the northern cause.

535;00:39:37,246;00:39:39,581;You're excused, Lord Varys.

536;00:39:41,083;00:39:44,669;Father, may I ask

536;00:39:41,083;00:39:44,669;the witness one question?

537;00:39:50,509;00:39:52,427;One.

538;00:39:55,598;00:39:57,565;You once said

539;00:39:57,600;00:40:01,319;that without me, this city would

539;00:39:57,600;00:40:01,319;have faced certain defeat.

540;00:40:01,353;00:40:04,939;You said the histories

540;00:40:01,353;00:40:04,939;would never mention me,

541;00:40:04,941;00:40:07,609;but you would not forget.

542;00:40:08,944;00:40:11,579;Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?

543;00:40:14,333;00:40:16,201;Sadly, my lord,

544;00:40:16,252;00:40:18,953;I never forget a thing.

545;00:40:28,631;00:40:31,099;We will adjourn for now.

546;00:40:32,468;00:40:35,053;Toll the bells

546;00:40:32,468;00:40:35,053;in an hour's time.

547;00:40:35,104;00:40:37,272;Clear the court!

548;00:40:57,126;00:40:59,711;You'd condemn

548;00:40:57,126;00:40:59,711;your own son to death?

549;00:40:59,745;00:41:01,913;I've condemned no one.

549;00:40:59,745;00:41:01,913;The trial is not over.

550;00:41:01,964;00:41:03,464;This isn't a trial.

550;00:41:01,964;00:41:03,464;It's a farce.

551;00:41:03,499;00:41:05,800;Cersei has manipulated

551;00:41:03,499;00:41:05,800;everything and you know it.

552;00:41:05,834;00:41:07,252;I know nothing of the sort.

553;00:41:07,303;00:41:09,804;You've always hated Tyrion.

553;00:41:07,303;00:41:09,804;He killed his king.

554;00:41:09,838;00:41:11,673;As did I.

555;00:41:11,675;00:41:14,259;Do you know the last order

555;00:41:11,675;00:41:14,259;the Mad King gave me?

556;00:41:14,293;00:41:17,161;To bring him your head.

557;00:41:17,229;00:41:19,681;I saved your life so you

557;00:41:17,229;00:41:19,681;could murder my brother?

558;00:41:19,683;00:41:22,483;It won't be murder. It'll be justice.

558;00:41:19,683;00:41:22,483;Justice?

559;00:41:22,518;00:41:25,687;I'm performing my sworn

559;00:41:22,518;00:41:25,687;duty as Hand of the King.

560;00:41:25,689;00:41:28,773;If Tyrion is found guilty, he

560;00:41:25,689;00:41:28,773;will be punished accordingly.

561;00:41:28,824;00:41:31,392;He'll be executed.

561;00:41:28,824;00:41:31,392;No, he'll be punished accordingly.

562;00:41:33,696;00:41:36,998;Once you said family

562;00:41:33,696;00:41:36,998;is what lives on.

563;00:41:37,032;00:41:39,033;All that lives on.

564;00:41:39,035;00:41:42,537;You told me about a dynasty

564;00:41:39,035;00:41:42,537;that would last 1,000 years.

565;00:41:42,588;00:41:45,456;What happens to your dynasty

565;00:41:42,588;00:41:45,456;when Tyrion dies?

566;00:41:46,709;00:41:48,376;I'm a Kingsguard,

567;00:41:48,378;00:41:50,295;forbidden by oath

567;00:41:48,378;00:41:50,295;to carry on the family line.

568;00:41:50,346;00:41:52,046;I'm well aware of your oath.

569;00:41:52,048;00:41:54,182;What happens to your name?

570;00:41:54,216;00:41:57,552;Who carries the lion banner

570;00:41:54,216;00:41:57,552;into future battles?

571;00:41:57,603;00:41:59,554;Your nephews?

572;00:41:59,605;00:42:01,189;Lancel Lannister?

573;00:42:01,223;00:42:03,441;Others whose names

573;00:42:01,223;00:42:03,441;I don't even remember?

574;00:42:03,475;00:42:05,143;What happens to my dynasty

575;00:42:05,194;00:42:07,412;if I spare the life

575;00:42:05,194;00:42:07,412;of my grandson's killer?

576;00:42:07,446;00:42:10,031;It survives through me.

577;00:42:12,568;00:42:14,402;I'll leave the Kingsguard.

578;00:42:14,404;00:42:17,238;I'll take my place

578;00:42:14,404;00:42:17,238;as your son and heir

579;00:42:17,240;00:42:20,124;if you let Tyrion live.

580;00:42:20,159;00:42:21,626;Done.

581;00:42:23,162;00:42:26,748;When the testimony's concluded

581;00:42:23,162;00:42:26,748;and a guilty verdict rendered,

582;00:42:26,750;00:42:28,499;Tyrion will be given

582;00:42:26,750;00:42:28,499;the chance to speak.

583;00:42:28,550;00:42:32,553;He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow

583;00:42:28,550;00:42:32,553;him to join the Night's Watch.

584;00:42:34,306;00:42:37,091;In three days' time, he'll

584;00:42:34,306;00:42:37,091;depart for Castle Black

585;00:42:37,142;00:42:38,810;and live out his days

585;00:42:37,142;00:42:38,810;at the Wall.

586;00:42:38,844;00:42:41,429;You'll remove your

586;00:42:38,844;00:42:41,429;white cloak immediately.

587;00:42:41,431;00:42:43,431;You will leave King's Landing

588;00:42:43,482;00:42:45,683;to assume your rightful

588;00:42:43,482;00:42:45,683;place at Casterly Rock.

589;00:42:45,734;00:42:48,152;You will marry a suitable woman

590;00:42:48,187;00:42:51,239;and father children

590;00:42:48,187;00:42:51,239;named Lannister.

591;00:42:51,273;00:42:55,159;And you'll never turn your

591;00:42:51,273;00:42:55,159;back on your family again.

592;00:43:00,282;00:43:01,783;You have my word.

593;00:43:01,785;00:43:03,618;And you have mine.

594;00:43:27,726;00:43:29,861;Not going well, is it?

595;00:43:29,895;00:43:32,363;You're going to be found guilty.

595;00:43:29,895;00:43:32,363;Oh, you think so?

596;00:43:32,398;00:43:35,149;When you are, you need to

596;00:43:32,398;00:43:35,149;enter a formal plea for mercy

597;00:43:35,200;00:43:37,452;and ask to be sent to the Wall.

598;00:43:37,486;00:43:39,454;Father's agreed to it.

599;00:43:39,488;00:43:42,206;He'll spare your life and allow

599;00:43:39,488;00:43:42,206;you to join the Night's Watch.

600;00:43:42,241;00:43:44,876;Ned Stark was promised

600;00:43:42,241;00:43:44,876;the same thing

601;00:43:44,910;00:43:46,878;and we both know

601;00:43:44,910;00:43:46,878;how that turned out.

602;00:43:46,912;00:43:48,830;Father is not Joffrey.

602;00:43:46,912;00:43:48,830;He'll keep his word.

603;00:43:48,832;00:43:50,665;How do you know?

604;00:43:54,470;00:43:56,387;Do you trust me?

605;00:43:59,341;00:44:01,926;Keep your mouth shut.

605;00:43:59,341;00:44:01,926;No more outbursts.

606;00:44:01,977;00:44:04,011;This will all be over soon.

607;00:44:19,945;00:44:22,864;The crown may call

607;00:44:19,945;00:44:22,864;its next witness.

608;00:44:57,349;00:44:59,400;State your name.

609;00:44:59,402;00:45:01,402;Shae.

610;00:45:01,404;00:45:03,621;Do you swear by all the gods

611;00:45:03,655;00:45:06,207;that your testimony

611;00:45:03,655;00:45:06,207;will be true and honest?

612;00:45:06,241;00:45:09,076;I swear it.

613;00:45:09,128;00:45:10,912;Do you know this man?

614;00:45:18,587;00:45:21,823;Yes. Tyrion Lannister.

615;00:45:21,857;00:45:23,674;How do you know him?

616;00:45:23,725;00:45:26,978;I was handmaiden

616;00:45:23,725;00:45:26,978;to his wife Lady Sansa.

617;00:45:27,012;00:45:31,098;This man stands accused

617;00:45:27,012;00:45:31,098;of murdering King Joffrey.

618;00:45:31,100;00:45:33,317;What do you know of this?

619;00:45:34,937;00:45:37,238;I know that he's guilty.

620;00:45:38,574;00:45:40,658;He and Sansa

620;00:45:38,574;00:45:40,658;planned it together.

621;00:45:41,945;00:45:44,445;Silence!

622;00:45:44,496;00:45:46,998;Continue.

623;00:45:47,032;00:45:49,951;She wanted revenge

623;00:45:47,032;00:45:49,951;for her father,

624;00:45:49,953;00:45:51,452;her mother, her brother.

625;00:45:51,503;00:45:54,288;She blamed their deaths

625;00:45:51,503;00:45:54,288;on the king.

626;00:45:54,290;00:45:56,707;Tyrion was happy to help.

627;00:45:56,758;00:46:00,378;He hated Joffrey.

627;00:45:56,758;00:46:00,378;He hated the queen.

628;00:46:00,429;00:46:03,447;He hated you, my lord.

629;00:46:03,482;00:46:06,634;He stole poison from

629;00:46:03,482;00:46:06,634;the Grand Maester's chamber

630;00:46:06,685;00:46:08,536;to put in Joffrey's wine.

631;00:46:08,570;00:46:11,105;How could you

631;00:46:08,570;00:46:11,105;possibly know all this?

632;00:46:11,139;00:46:14,942;Why would he reveal

632;00:46:11,139;00:46:14,942;such plans to his wife's maid?

633;00:46:16,562;00:46:18,996;I wasn't just her maid.

634;00:46:21,817;00:46:23,484;I was his whore.

635;00:46:23,486;00:46:26,487;I beg your pardon?

636;00:46:26,489;00:46:28,155;You said you were his...

637;00:46:28,207;00:46:30,041;His whore.

638;00:46:32,911;00:46:35,379;How did you come

638;00:46:32,911;00:46:35,379;to be in his service?

639;00:46:35,414;00:46:36,714;He stole me.

640;00:46:36,748;00:46:38,249;I was with another man,

641;00:46:38,300;00:46:39,834;a knight in

641;00:46:38,300;00:46:39,834;your lordship's army.

642;00:46:39,836;00:46:42,386;But when Tyrion arrived

642;00:46:39,836;00:46:42,386;at the camp,

643;00:46:42,471;00:46:44,639;he sent one of his cutthroats

643;00:46:42,471;00:46:44,639;into our tent.

644;00:46:44,673;00:46:49,176;He broke the knight's arm

644;00:46:44,673;00:46:49,176;and brought me to Lord Tyrion.

645;00:46:49,178;00:46:51,679;You belong to me now, he said.

646;00:46:51,730;00:46:55,683;I want you to fuck me like it's

646;00:46:51,730;00:46:55,683;my last night in this world.

647;00:46:58,437;00:47:01,155;Silence. Silence!

648;00:47:02,441;00:47:04,075;And did you?

649;00:47:04,109;00:47:06,611;Did I what?

650;00:47:06,662;00:47:09,330;Fuck him like it was

650;00:47:06,662;00:47:09,330;his last night in this world.

651;00:47:11,366;00:47:13,834;I did everything he wanted.

652;00:47:13,869;00:47:15,920;Whatever he told me

652;00:47:13,869;00:47:15,920;to do to him.

653;00:47:16,040;00:47:17,816;Whatever he felt like doing to me.

654;00:47:18,055;00:47:19,937;I kissed him where he wanted.

655;00:47:20,057;00:47:21,459;I licked him where he wanted.

656;00:47:21,579;00:47:24,894;I let him put himself

656;00:47:21,579;00:47:24,894;where he wanted.

657;00:47:24,945;00:47:26,863;I was his property.

658;00:47:26,897;00:47:29,115;I would wait in his chambers

658;00:47:26,897;00:47:29,115;for hours

659;00:47:29,149;00:47:30,984;so he could use me

659;00:47:29,149;00:47:30,984;when he was bored.

660;00:47:31,035;00:47:34,954;He ordered me to call

660;00:47:31,035;00:47:34,954;him my lion, so I did.

661;00:47:34,989;00:47:38,658;I took his face

661;00:47:34,989;00:47:38,658;in my hands and said,

662;00:47:38,709;00:47:41,744;I am yours and you are mine.

663;00:47:45,466;00:47:47,000;Shae.

664;00:47:50,220;00:47:52,255;Please don't.

665;00:47:54,475;00:47:56,809;I am a whore.

666;00:47:56,844;00:47:59,429;Remember?

667;00:48:01,398;00:48:03,433;That was before

667;00:48:01,398;00:48:03,433;he married Sansa.

668;00:48:03,435;00:48:06,102;After that,

668;00:48:03,435;00:48:06,102;all he wanted was her.

669;00:48:06,104;00:48:08,688;But she wouldn't let him

669;00:48:06,104;00:48:08,688;into her bed.

670;00:48:10,157;00:48:12,942;So he promised to kill

670;00:48:10,157;00:48:12,942;King Joffrey for her.

671;00:48:24,171;00:48:26,789;I wish to confess.

672;00:48:28,008;00:48:31,293;I wish... to confess.

673;00:48:33,463;00:48:35,965;You wish to confess?

674;00:48:37,851;00:48:39,468;I saved you.

675;00:48:41,221;00:48:43,522;I saved this city

676;00:48:43,557;00:48:47,059;and all your worthless lives.

677;00:48:47,110;00:48:50,613;I should have let

677;00:48:47,110;00:48:50,613;Stannis kill you all.

678;00:48:50,647;00:48:53,282;Tyrion.

679;00:48:56,153;00:48:58,654;Do you wish to confess?

680;00:49:02,209;00:49:04,794;Yes, Father.

681;00:49:04,828;00:49:07,329;I'm guilty.

682;00:49:07,364;00:49:10,332;Guilty. Is that what

682;00:49:07,364;00:49:10,332;you want to hear?

683;00:49:10,334;00:49:12,468;You admit you poisoned the king?

684;00:49:12,502;00:49:15,054;No, of that I'm innocent.

685;00:49:15,088;00:49:19,091;I'm guilty of a far

685;00:49:15,088;00:49:19,091;more monstrous crime.

686;00:49:19,142;00:49:22,595;I am guilty of being a dwarf.

687;00:49:23,763;00:49:26,182;You are not on trial

687;00:49:23,763;00:49:26,182;for being a dwarf.

688;00:49:26,233;00:49:28,451;Oh, yes, I am.

689;00:49:28,485;00:49:32,688;I've been on trial

689;00:49:28,485;00:49:32,688;for that my entire life.

690;00:49:33,907;00:49:35,608;Have you nothing to say

690;00:49:33,907;00:49:35,608;in your defense?

691;00:49:35,642;00:49:37,042;Nothing but this...

692;00:49:37,077;00:49:40,029;I did not do it.

693;00:49:40,031;00:49:42,998;I did not kill Joffrey,

694;00:49:43,033;00:49:45,334;but I wish that I had.

695;00:49:45,368;00:49:48,204;Watching your vicious

695;00:49:45,368;00:49:48,204;bastard die

696;00:49:48,255;00:49:52,341;gave me more relief

696;00:49:48,255;00:49:52,341;than 1,000 lying whores.

697;00:49:55,295;00:49:59,715;I wish I was the monster

697;00:49:55,295;00:49:59,715;you think I am.

698;00:50:01,101;00:50:04,687;I wish I had enough poison

698;00:50:01,101;00:50:04,687;for the whole pack of you.

699;00:50:04,721;00:50:06,889;I would gladly give my life

700;00:50:06,891;00:50:09,225;to watch you all swallow it.

701;00:50:09,227;00:50:11,277;Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn.

702;00:50:11,361;00:50:15,423;Escort the prisoner

702;00:50:11,361;00:50:15,423;back to his cell.

703;00:50:15,458;00:50:19,845;I will not give my life

703;00:50:15,458;00:50:19,845;for Joffrey's murder.

704;00:50:19,879;00:50:23,098;And I know I'll get

704;00:50:19,879;00:50:23,098;no justice here.

705;00:50:23,132;00:50:26,384;So I will let

705;00:50:23,132;00:50:26,384;the gods decide my fate.

706;00:50:27,804;00:50:31,273;I demand a trial by combat.
