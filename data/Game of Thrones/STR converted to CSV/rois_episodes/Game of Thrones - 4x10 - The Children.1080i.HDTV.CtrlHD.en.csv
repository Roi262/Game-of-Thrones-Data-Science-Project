1;00:05:17,850;00:05:20,736;You're wearing
﻿1;00:05:17,850;00:05:20,736;a black cloak again.
2;00:05:20,787;00:05:23,622;I've been sent
2;00:05:20,787;00:05:23,622;to negotiate with you.
3;00:05:52,318;00:05:54,986;It appears my trusting
3;00:05:52,318;00:05:54,986;nature got the better of me.
4;00:05:55,021;00:05:57,239;It's happened before.
5;00:05:57,273;00:06:01,076;I was hoping your loyalty was real when
5;00:05:57,273;00:06:01,076;you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow.
6;00:06:01,110;00:06:02,894;Truly I was.
7;00:06:02,913;00:06:04,746;The Half hand ordered me
7;00:06:02,913;00:06:04,746;to join your army
8;00:06:04,781;00:06:07,532;and bring back whatever information
8;00:06:04,781;00:06:07,532;I could to Castle Black.
9;00:06:07,583;00:06:10,068;He made me kill him
9;00:06:07,583;00:06:10,068;so you'd trust me.
10;00:06:10,087;00:06:11,670;I was loyal...
11;00:06:11,704;00:06:14,339;to him and to my
11;00:06:11,704;00:06:14,339;Night's Watch vows.
12;00:06:14,374;00:06:16,291;All your vows?
13;00:06:18,594;00:06:22,080;She wasn't enough
13;00:06:18,594;00:06:22,080;to turn you, eh?
14;00:06:22,098;00:06:24,249;Were you enough
14;00:06:22,098;00:06:24,249;to turn her?
15;00:06:24,268;00:06:27,052;She put three
15;00:06:24,268;00:06:27,052;arrows in me
16;00:06:27,086;00:06:29,137;when I escaped.
17;00:06:30,940;00:06:32,757;Did you see her
17;00:06:30,940;00:06:32,757;again at Castle Black?
18;00:06:32,775;00:06:35,977;Yes.
18;00:06:32,775;00:06:35,977;And?
19;00:06:36,028;00:06:38,196;She's dead.
20;00:06:39,365;00:06:42,567;Your doing?
20;00:06:39,365;00:06:42,567;No.
21;00:06:44,570;00:06:46,071;We'll drink to her.
22;00:07:09,479;00:07:11,646;Of all the ways
22;00:07:09,479;00:07:11,646;I'd kill you,
23;00:07:11,681;00:07:14,099;poison would be
23;00:07:11,681;00:07:14,099;the last.
24;00:07:17,236;00:07:19,488;Ygritte.
24;00:07:17,236;00:07:19,488;Ygritte.
25;00:07:28,948;00:07:30,198;That's not wine.
26;00:07:30,249;00:07:33,285;No, it's a proper
26;00:07:30,249;00:07:33,285;northern drink, Jon Snow.
27;00:07:33,319;00:07:36,505;You did well.
27;00:07:33,319;00:07:36,505;Fought hard.
28;00:07:36,539;00:07:38,623;Killed some of
28;00:07:36,539;00:07:38,623;our strongest men.
29;00:07:38,657;00:07:41,376;One of our giants
29;00:07:38,657;00:07:41,376;went into your tunnel
30;00:07:41,427;00:07:43,678;and never
30;00:07:41,427;00:07:43,678;came out again.
31;00:07:43,713;00:07:45,630;Mag the Mighty.
32;00:07:45,681;00:07:47,516;He's dead.
33;00:07:47,550;00:07:49,684;He killed
33;00:07:47,550;00:07:49,684;my friend Grenn.
34;00:07:49,719;00:07:51,102;He was their king.
35;00:07:51,137;00:07:53,772;The last of a bloodline
35;00:07:51,137;00:07:53,772;that stretches back
36;00:07:53,806;00:07:55,857;before the First Men.
37;00:07:55,892;00:07:57,809;Grenn came from a farm.
38;00:08:02,014;00:08:04,983;Mag and Grenn.
38;00:08:02,014;00:08:04,983;Grenn and Mag.
39;00:08:07,703;00:08:10,355;Kullback, could I trouble
39;00:08:07,703;00:08:10,355;you for something to eat?
40;00:08:10,373;00:08:13,291;I don't imagine our guest
40;00:08:10,373;00:08:13,291;has eaten anything
41;00:08:13,326;00:08:15,160;for quite some time.
42;00:08:16,379;00:08:20,465;So, you're here
42;00:08:16,379;00:08:20,465;to strike a bargain?
43;00:08:21,834;00:08:24,219;Turn your army around
43;00:08:21,834;00:08:24,219;and go home.
44;00:08:24,253;00:08:26,505;You know I know
44;00:08:24,253;00:08:26,505;you're low on arrows,
45;00:08:26,539;00:08:28,557;you're low on oil,
45;00:08:26,539;00:08:28,557;you're low on men.
46;00:08:28,591;00:08:30,475;How many are left, 50?
47;00:08:30,510;00:08:32,511;I told Tormund and Orell.
48;00:08:32,545;00:08:34,262;We have more
48;00:08:32,545;00:08:34,262;than 1,000 men.
49;00:08:34,313;00:08:36,064;I showed you
49;00:08:34,313;00:08:36,064;everything I had.
50;00:08:36,098;00:08:37,899;The whole army,
50;00:08:36,098;00:08:37,899;100,000 strong.
51;00:08:37,935;00:08:41,186;And what did you do? You fired
51;00:08:37,935;00:08:41,186;on us with everything you had.
52;00:08:41,220;00:08:43,888;It wasn't much.
52;00:08:41,220;00:08:43,888;As soon as I saw that,
53;00:08:43,906;00:08:47,225;I sent 400 men
53;00:08:43,906;00:08:47,225;to climb the Wall,
54;00:08:47,243;00:08:49,611;an unmanned stretch
54;00:08:47,243;00:08:49,611;five miles west of here.
55;00:08:49,662;00:08:51,530;A lot of them
55;00:08:49,662;00:08:51,530;will die climbing,
56;00:08:51,581;00:08:53,582;but most of them will be
56;00:08:51,581;00:08:53,582;over by the end of the day.
57;00:08:53,616;00:08:56,868;It's me being honest
57;00:08:53,616;00:08:56,868;with you, Jon Snow,
58;00:08:56,902;00:08:59,404;which is more than
58;00:08:56,902;00:08:59,404;you've ever done for me.
59;00:08:59,422;00:09:01,239;My people
59;00:08:59,422;00:09:01,239;have bled enough.
60;00:09:01,257;00:09:03,041;We're not here
60;00:09:01,257;00:09:03,041;to conquer.
61;00:09:03,092;00:09:06,094;We're here to hide
61;00:09:03,092;00:09:06,094;behind your Wall.
62;00:09:06,128;00:09:10,382;Just like you.
62;00:09:06,128;00:09:10,382;We need your tunnel.
63;00:09:10,416;00:09:13,602;Now we both know
63;00:09:10,416;00:09:13,602;that winter is coming.
64;00:09:13,636;00:09:17,255;And if my people aren't south of
64;00:09:13,636;00:09:17,255;the Wall when it comes in earnest,
65;00:09:17,273;00:09:19,224;we'll all end up
65;00:09:17,273;00:09:19,224;worse than dead.
66;00:09:19,258;00:09:22,110;You want to strike
66;00:09:19,258;00:09:22,110;a bargain with me?
67;00:09:22,144;00:09:23,612;Here's the bargain.
68;00:09:23,646;00:09:26,097;You go back,
68;00:09:23,646;00:09:26,097;you open the gates to us,
69;00:09:26,116;00:09:29,434;and I swear to you
69;00:09:26,116;00:09:29,434;that no one else will die.
70;00:09:29,452;00:09:31,736;Refuse,
71;00:09:31,787;00:09:34,623;and we'll kill every
71;00:09:31,787;00:09:34,623;last man at Castle Black.
72;00:09:36,826;00:09:37,993;Ah!
73;00:09:40,796;00:09:45,050;Oh, that's why
73;00:09:40,796;00:09:45,050;you're here.
74;00:09:45,084;00:09:48,720;I reckon you could do it before
74;00:09:45,084;00:09:48,720;any of them could stop you.
75;00:09:48,754;00:09:50,722;They'd kill you,
75;00:09:48,754;00:09:50,722;of course.
76;00:09:50,756;00:09:51,973;They'd kill you slow.
77;00:09:52,008;00:09:55,260;But you knew that
77;00:09:52,008;00:09:55,260;when you came in here.
78;00:09:56,462;00:09:59,514;Are you capable
78;00:09:56,462;00:09:59,514;of that, Jon Snow?
79;00:09:59,565;00:10:03,468;Killing a man in his own tent
79;00:09:59,565;00:10:03,468;when he's just offered you peace?
80;00:10:03,486;00:10:05,487;Is that what
80;00:10:03,486;00:10:05,487;the Night's Watch is?
81;00:10:05,521;00:10:07,939;Is that what you are?
82;00:10:10,743;00:10:14,112;Riders coming!
83;00:10:14,146;00:10:15,780;Are you attacking us?
83;00:10:14,146;00:10:15,780;No.
84;00:10:15,814;00:10:17,782;It's like you said,
84;00:10:15,814;00:10:17,782;we don't have the men.
85;00:10:45,277;00:10:47,812;Hold! To me!
85;00:10:45,277;00:10:47,812;To me!
86;00:12:00,052;00:12:02,187;Stand down!
87;00:12:03,639;00:12:05,940;I said my people
87;00:12:03,639;00:12:05,940;have bled enough
88;00:12:05,975;00:12:08,309;and I meant it.
89;00:12:42,261;00:12:44,262;Round them up.
90;00:12:44,296;00:12:45,930;Stay with the horses.
91;00:12:55,474;00:12:57,826;You're the
91;00:12:55,474;00:12:57,826;King-beyond-the-Wall?
92;00:13:00,446;00:13:03,114;Do you know who I am?
92;00:13:00,446;00:13:03,114;Never had the pleasure.
93;00:13:03,148;00:13:04,532;This is Stannis Baratheon,
94;00:13:04,583;00:13:06,334;the one true king
94;00:13:04,583;00:13:06,334;of the Seven Kingdoms.
95;00:13:06,369;00:13:09,287;We're not in the Seven Kingdoms and
95;00:13:06,369;00:13:09,287;you're not dressed for this weather.
96;00:13:10,706;00:13:13,842;It is customary to kneel
96;00:13:10,706;00:13:13,842;when surrendering to a king.
97;00:13:20,182;00:13:22,100;We do not kneel.
98;00:13:22,134;00:13:24,636;I'll have thousands of your
98;00:13:22,134;00:13:24,636;men in chains by nightfall,
99;00:13:24,670;00:13:26,855;have nowhere to put them,
99;00:13:24,670;00:13:26,855;have nothing to feed them.
100;00:13:26,889;00:13:29,858;I'm not here
100;00:13:26,889;00:13:29,858;to slaughter beat dogs.
101;00:13:29,892;00:13:33,194;Their fate
101;00:13:29,892;00:13:33,194;depends on their king.
102;00:13:33,229;00:13:37,198;All the same,
102;00:13:33,229;00:13:37,198;we do not kneel.
103;00:13:39,852;00:13:42,487;Take these men away.
104;00:13:42,521;00:13:45,240;What's a man of the Night's
104;00:13:42,521;00:13:45,240;Watch doing in a wildling camp?
105;00:13:47,192;00:13:50,027;I was sent to discuss terms
105;00:13:47,192;00:13:50,027;with the King-beyond-the-Wall.
106;00:13:50,045;00:13:51,663;You're speaking
106;00:13:50,045;00:13:51,663;to the one true king, boy.
107;00:13:51,714;00:13:54,215;You will address him
107;00:13:51,714;00:13:54,215;as Your Grace.
108;00:13:54,251;00:13:57,552;I know he's the king.
108;00:13:54,251;00:13:57,552;My father died for him.
109;00:13:59,755;00:14:02,257;My name is Jon Snow,
109;00:13:59,755;00:14:02,257;Your Grace.
110;00:14:02,308;00:14:04,642;I'm Ned Stark's son.
111;00:14:07,045;00:14:09,647;Your father
111;00:14:07,045;00:14:09,647;was an honorable man.
112;00:14:09,682;00:14:11,566;He was, Your Grace.
113;00:14:11,600;00:14:13,685;What do you think
113;00:14:11,600;00:14:13,685;he'd have done with him?
114;00:14:19,408;00:14:21,893;I was this man's
114;00:14:19,408;00:14:21,893;prisoner once.
115;00:14:21,911;00:14:25,163;He could have tortured me.
115;00:14:21,911;00:14:25,163;He could have killed me.
116;00:14:26,398;00:14:28,783;But he spared my life.
117;00:14:28,834;00:14:31,035;I think my father would
117;00:14:28,834;00:14:31,035;have taken him prisoner,
118;00:14:31,069;00:14:33,121;listened to what
118;00:14:31,069;00:14:33,121;he had to say.
119;00:14:36,675;00:14:38,793;Very well, then.
119;00:14:36,675;00:14:38,793;Take him.
120;00:14:44,934;00:14:47,135;Your Grace.
121;00:14:47,186;00:14:49,938;If my father had seen
121;00:14:47,186;00:14:49,938;the things that I've seen,
122;00:14:49,972;00:14:53,358;he'd also tell you to burn
122;00:14:49,972;00:14:53,358;the dead before nightfall.
123;00:14:54,643;00:14:56,394;All of them.
124;00:15:05,120;00:15:07,772;I would suggest
124;00:15:05,120;00:15:07,772;milk of the poppy
125;00:15:07,790;00:15:10,408;to ease his pain, but he
125;00:15:07,790;00:15:10,408;is completely insensate.
126;00:15:10,459;00:15:11,876;Bloody Martells.
127;00:15:11,911;00:15:13,945;The cause appears
127;00:15:11,911;00:15:13,945;to be manticore venom.
128;00:15:13,963;00:15:16,280;It is.
128;00:15:13,963;00:15:16,280;The Death's Head manticore.
129;00:15:16,299;00:15:19,951;Yes, I've read
129;00:15:16,299;00:15:19,951;a great deal about it.
130;00:15:19,969;00:15:21,920;It's a horrible poison.
131;00:15:21,954;00:15:24,639;Usually Mantari
131;00:15:21,954;00:15:24,639;in origin.
132;00:15:24,673;00:15:26,557;Oh! Yes, yes.
133;00:15:26,592;00:15:28,092;There's nothing
133;00:15:26,592;00:15:28,092;to be done.
134;00:15:28,126;00:15:29,560;Yes, there is.
135;00:15:30,930;00:15:33,965;May I ask what you
135;00:15:30,930;00:15:33,965;think you're doing?
136;00:15:33,983;00:15:35,350;Saving him.
137;00:15:35,401;00:15:37,318;Your Grace, I wish
137;00:15:35,401;00:15:37,318;it were otherwise,
138;00:15:37,353;00:15:39,771;but Ser Gregor
138;00:15:37,353;00:15:39,771;is beyond saving.
139;00:15:39,805;00:15:42,323;Well, well beyond.
140;00:15:42,358;00:15:44,943;This man is not
140;00:15:42,358;00:15:44,943;even a maester,
141;00:15:44,977;00:15:46,811;let alone Grand Maester.
142;00:15:46,830;00:15:48,529;That's for the best.
143;00:15:48,580;00:15:49,948;No maester knows
143;00:15:48,580;00:15:49,948;how to save him.
144;00:15:49,982;00:15:52,083;That is exactly
144;00:15:49,982;00:15:52,083;the sort of arrogance
145;00:15:52,117;00:15:55,086;that had him expelled from
145;00:15:52,117;00:15:55,086;the Citadel, Your Grace.
146;00:15:55,120;00:15:58,990;His curiosity was deemed
146;00:15:55,120;00:15:58,990;dangerous and unnatural.
147;00:15:59,008;00:16:01,209;Rightly so,
147;00:15:59,008;00:16:01,209;in my opinion.
148;00:16:01,260;00:16:03,795;You're dismissed,
148;00:16:01,260;00:16:03,795;Grand Maester.
149;00:16:05,464;00:16:09,350;But, Your Grace,
149;00:16:05,464;00:16:09,350;this is my laboratory.
150;00:16:09,385;00:16:12,136;Not anymore.
150;00:16:09,385;00:16:12,136;- But I--
151;00:16:19,111;00:16:22,146;You can save him?
151;00:16:19,111;00:16:22,146;Difficult to say, Your Grace.
152;00:16:22,197;00:16:24,399;But if my past work
152;00:16:22,197;00:16:24,399;is any guide...
153;00:16:26,235;00:16:28,019;...we stand a chance.
154;00:16:28,037;00:16:30,621;Do everything you can.
155;00:16:30,656;00:16:32,323;Come to me
155;00:16:30,656;00:16:32,323;for anything you need.
156;00:16:32,357;00:16:33,858;Thank you,
156;00:16:32,357;00:16:33,858;Your Grace.
157;00:16:33,876;00:16:35,793;You should know,
158;00:16:35,828;00:16:38,880;the process
158;00:16:35,828;00:16:38,880;may change him...
159;00:16:39,882;00:16:42,000;somewhat.
160;00:16:44,169;00:16:46,120;Will it weaken him?
161;00:16:47,256;00:16:48,873;Oh, no.
162;00:16:48,891;00:16:51,009;Very well, then.
163;00:17:09,394;00:17:11,362;Not another word.
164;00:17:11,396;00:17:13,865;We've been over this.
164;00:17:11,396;00:17:13,865;The matter's closed.
165;00:17:13,899;00:17:16,951;I'm opening it again.
166;00:17:17,002;00:17:20,038;You were betrothed
166;00:17:17,002;00:17:20,038;to Loras Tyrell.
167;00:17:20,090;00:17:22,590;You're still betrothed
167;00:17:20,090;00:17:22,590;to Loras Tyrell.
168;00:17:22,624;00:17:24,709;And you will marry
168;00:17:22,624;00:17:24,709;Loras Tyrell
169;00:17:24,760;00:17:27,078;as soon as Tommen
169;00:17:24,760;00:17:27,078;marries Margaery.
170;00:17:27,129;00:17:28,463;I will not.
171;00:17:28,514;00:17:31,499;Jaime cannot marry
171;00:17:28,514;00:17:31,499;or inherit lands.
172;00:17:31,533;00:17:34,552;Tyrion's sentence will
172;00:17:31,533;00:17:34,552;be carried out tomorrow.
173;00:17:36,555;00:17:39,891;You have on several
173;00:17:36,555;00:17:39,891;occasions made great claims
174;00:17:39,925;00:17:42,593;about your commitment
174;00:17:39,925;00:17:42,593;to this family's future.
175;00:17:42,611;00:17:44,445;Your role in that future
176;00:17:44,480;00:17:46,647;is more vital now
176;00:17:44,480;00:17:46,647;than it ever was.
177;00:17:46,698;00:17:48,599;I don't care.
178;00:17:48,617;00:17:52,036;I will stay in King's Landing where
178;00:17:48,617;00:17:52,036;I belong with my son the king.
179;00:17:52,071;00:17:55,289;When you were nine years old,
179;00:17:52,071;00:17:55,289;I was called to the capital.
180;00:17:55,324;00:17:58,076;I decided to take your
180;00:17:55,324;00:17:58,076;brother with me and not you.
181;00:17:58,110;00:18:01,629;You insisted that you would
181;00:17:58,110;00:18:01,629;not be left at Casterly Rock
182;00:18:01,663;00:18:04,465;under any circumstances.
182;00:18:01,663;00:18:04,465;And if you recall--
183;00:18:04,500;00:18:06,617;I'm not interested in hearing
183;00:18:04,500;00:18:06,617;another one of your smug stories
184;00:18:06,636;00:18:08,803;about the time you won.
185;00:18:08,837;00:18:10,805;This isn't going to be
185;00:18:08,837;00:18:10,805;one of those times.
186;00:18:10,839;00:18:12,890;Do you think
186;00:18:10,839;00:18:12,890;you'll be the first person
187;00:18:12,925;00:18:15,977;dragged into a sept to be
187;00:18:12,925;00:18:15,977;married against her will?
188;00:18:16,011;00:18:17,979;When you marched into
188;00:18:16,011;00:18:17,979;the throne room to tell me
189;00:18:18,013;00:18:20,648;we'd won the Battle of
189;00:18:18,013;00:18:20,648;Blackwater-- do you remember?
190;00:18:22,568;00:18:25,653;I was sitting on the Iron
190;00:18:22,568;00:18:25,653;Throne with Tommen.
191;00:18:25,687;00:18:27,355;I was about to give him
191;00:18:25,687;00:18:27,355;essence of nightshade.
192;00:18:27,406;00:18:29,306;That's how far I was willing
192;00:18:27,406;00:18:29,306;to go when I thought
193;00:18:29,324;00:18:32,076;someone awful had come
193;00:18:29,324;00:18:32,076;to take my son away.
194;00:18:34,113;00:18:36,497;Someone awful is coming
194;00:18:34,113;00:18:36,497;to take him away.
195;00:18:36,532;00:18:38,699;No.
195;00:18:36,532;00:18:38,699;Joffrey is dead.
196;00:18:38,750;00:18:41,152;Myrcella's been sold
196;00:18:38,750;00:18:41,152;like livestock.
197;00:18:41,170;00:18:44,155;And now you want to ship me off
197;00:18:41,170;00:18:44,155;to Highgarden and steal my boy.
198;00:18:44,173;00:18:46,591;My last boy.
199;00:18:46,625;00:18:48,659;Margaery will dig
199;00:18:46,625;00:18:48,659;her claws in,
200;00:18:48,677;00:18:51,095;you will dig your claws in
200;00:18:48,677;00:18:51,095;and you'll fight over him
201;00:18:51,130;00:18:53,297;like beasts
201;00:18:51,130;00:18:53,297;until you rip him apart.
202;00:18:53,331;00:18:57,051;I will burn our house to the
202;00:18:53,331;00:18:57,051;ground before I let that happen.
203;00:18:57,102;00:19:00,138;And how will you do that?
204;00:19:00,172;00:19:03,141;I'll tell
204;00:19:00,172;00:19:03,141;everyone the truth.
205;00:19:03,175;00:19:05,309;What truth
205;00:19:03,175;00:19:05,309;would that be?
206;00:19:10,065;00:19:11,482;You don't know, do you?
207;00:19:13,619;00:19:16,070;You never believed it.
208;00:19:17,039;00:19:19,157;How is that possible?
209;00:19:20,626;00:19:23,244;What am I saying?
209;00:19:20,626;00:19:23,244;Of course it's possible.
210;00:19:23,295;00:19:27,048;How can someone so consumed
210;00:19:23,295;00:19:27,048;by the idea of his family
211;00:19:27,082;00:19:30,001;have any conception what his
211;00:19:27,082;00:19:30,001;actual family was doing?
212;00:19:31,536;00:19:34,388;We were right there in front
212;00:19:31,536;00:19:34,388;of you and you didn't see us.
213;00:19:34,423;00:19:36,557;One look
213;00:19:34,423;00:19:36,557;in the past 20 years,
214;00:19:36,592;00:19:39,560;one real look at your own children
214;00:19:36,592;00:19:39,560;and you would have known.
215;00:19:39,595;00:19:42,096;Known what?
216;00:19:42,147;00:19:44,548;Everything they say
216;00:19:42,147;00:19:44,548;is true.
217;00:19:44,566;00:19:46,184;About Jaime and me.
217;00:19:44,566;00:19:46,184;No.
218;00:19:46,218;00:19:48,986;Your legacy is a lie.
218;00:19:46,218;00:19:48,986;No, no, no, no.
219;00:19:49,021;00:19:51,856;I don't believe you.
220;00:19:54,993;00:19:57,028;Yes, you do.
221;00:20:14,129;00:20:16,881;Jaime.
222;00:20:16,915;00:20:19,133;You won.
223;00:20:19,184;00:20:21,936;One fewer brother.
223;00:20:19,184;00:20:21,936;Must be proud of yourself.
224;00:20:21,970;00:20:24,272;There's really nothing
224;00:20:21,970;00:20:24,272;you wouldn't do, is there?
225;00:20:24,307;00:20:26,057;For my family,
225;00:20:24,307;00:20:26,057;no, nothing.
226;00:20:26,091;00:20:28,442;I would do things for my
226;00:20:26,091;00:20:28,442;family you couldn't imagine.
227;00:20:28,478;00:20:30,978;Tyrion is your family.
227;00:20:28,478;00:20:30,978;He's not.
228;00:20:31,029;00:20:33,898;You don't get to choose.
228;00:20:31,029;00:20:33,898;I do. So do you.
229;00:20:33,932;00:20:37,268;You can choose the creature that killed
229;00:20:33,932;00:20:37,268;our mother to come into this world--
230;00:20:37,286;00:20:39,603;Are you really mad enough
230;00:20:37,286;00:20:39,603;to blame him for that?
231;00:20:39,622;00:20:42,490;He didn't decide to kill her.
231;00:20:39,622;00:20:42,490;He was an infant.
232;00:20:42,541;00:20:44,375;A disease doesn't decide
232;00:20:42,541;00:20:44,375;to kill you.
233;00:20:44,409;00:20:47,128;All the same, you cut
233;00:20:44,409;00:20:47,128;it out before it does.
234;00:20:47,162;00:20:50,131;What do you decide?
234;00:20:47,162;00:20:50,131;What do you choose?
235;00:20:50,165;00:20:51,666;The things I did
235;00:20:50,165;00:20:51,666;to get back to you,
236;00:20:51,717;00:20:54,585;to endure all that,
236;00:20:51,717;00:20:54,585;only to find you--
237;00:20:57,506;00:20:59,557;I choose you.
238;00:20:59,591;00:21:01,225;Those are words.
238;00:20:59,591;00:21:01,225;Yes.
239;00:21:01,260;00:21:03,561;Like the ones
239;00:21:01,260;00:21:03,561;I just said to Father.
240;00:21:04,680;00:21:06,297;I told him.
241;00:21:06,315;00:21:08,149;Told him what?
242;00:21:08,183;00:21:10,234;I told him about us.
243;00:21:11,486;00:21:12,937;You told him?
244;00:21:12,971;00:21:14,989;I told him I won't
244;00:21:12,971;00:21:14,989;marry Loras Tyrell.
245;00:21:15,023;00:21:18,693;I told him I'm staying right
245;00:21:15,023;00:21:18,693;here with Tommen, with you.
246;00:21:18,744;00:21:20,161;You think he'll
246;00:21:18,744;00:21:20,161;just accept that?
247;00:21:20,195;00:21:22,196;Go and ask him.
248;00:21:24,816;00:21:26,083;What did you say?
249;00:21:26,118;00:21:28,452;I don't want to talk
249;00:21:26,118;00:21:28,452;about Tywin Lannister.
250;00:21:28,486;00:21:31,088;I don't choose
250;00:21:28,486;00:21:31,088;Tywin Lannister.
251;00:21:31,123;00:21:32,873;I don't love
251;00:21:31,123;00:21:32,873;Tywin Lannister.
252;00:21:32,924;00:21:35,126;I love my brother.
253;00:21:35,177;00:21:37,094;I love my lover.
254;00:21:38,380;00:21:40,548;People will whisper,
254;00:21:38,380;00:21:40,548;they'll make their jokes.
255;00:21:40,599;00:21:41,966;Let them.
256;00:21:42,000;00:21:44,635;They're all so small,
256;00:21:42,000;00:21:44,635;I can't even see them.
257;00:21:44,686;00:21:46,937;I only see what matters.
258;00:21:55,847;00:21:57,281;Someone will walk in.
259;00:21:57,316;00:21:58,816;I don't care.
260;00:22:35,053;00:22:38,606;I can speak the common
260;00:22:35,053;00:22:38,606;tongue if you wish.
261;00:22:38,657;00:22:40,241;You speak it very well.
262;00:22:40,275;00:22:44,195;Before you freed me, I
262;00:22:40,275;00:22:44,195;belonged to Master Mighdal.
263;00:22:44,229;00:22:46,247;I was tutor
263;00:22:44,229;00:22:46,247;to his children.
264;00:22:46,281;00:22:48,282;I taught them languages
264;00:22:46,281;00:22:48,282;and history.
265;00:22:48,333;00:22:52,403;They know a great deal about
265;00:22:48,333;00:22:52,403;your family because of me.
266;00:22:52,421;00:22:55,539;Little Calla
266;00:22:52,421;00:22:55,539;is only seven,
267;00:22:55,574;00:22:57,925;but she admires you
267;00:22:55,574;00:22:57,925;very much.
268;00:22:57,959;00:23:00,745;I hope I can prove
268;00:22:57,959;00:23:00,745;worthy of her admiration.
269;00:23:00,779;00:23:03,097;What can I do for you?
270;00:23:04,549;00:23:06,967;When you took the city,
270;00:23:04,549;00:23:06,967;the children begged me
271;00:23:07,018;00:23:09,553;not to leave the house.
272;00:23:09,587;00:23:13,307;But Master Mighdal
272;00:23:09,587;00:23:13,307;and I agreed that I must.
273;00:23:13,358;00:23:16,193;So I lost my home.
274;00:23:18,063;00:23:20,114;Now I live on the streets.
275;00:23:20,148;00:23:21,765;I have outfitted mess halls
276;00:23:21,783;00:23:24,235;to feed all former slaves
276;00:23:21,783;00:23:24,235;and barracks to shelter them.
277;00:23:24,286;00:23:27,004;I do not mean
277;00:23:24,286;00:23:27,004;to offend, Your Grace.
278;00:23:27,038;00:23:29,874;I went to one
278;00:23:27,038;00:23:29,874;of these places.
279;00:23:29,908;00:23:32,209;The young prey on the old.
280;00:23:32,244;00:23:35,763;Take what they want
280;00:23:32,244;00:23:35,763;and beat us if we resist.
281;00:23:35,797;00:23:38,115;My Unsullied will make them
281;00:23:35,797;00:23:38,115;safe again in short order,
282;00:23:38,150;00:23:39,884;my friend,
282;00:23:38,150;00:23:39,884;this I promise you.
283;00:23:39,918;00:23:43,687;Even if they are safe,
283;00:23:39,918;00:23:43,687;who would I be there?
284;00:23:43,722;00:23:46,424;What purpose
284;00:23:43,722;00:23:46,424;would I serve?
285;00:23:46,475;00:23:49,894;With my master,
285;00:23:46,475;00:23:49,894;I was a teacher.
286;00:23:49,928;00:23:53,764;I had the respect
286;00:23:49,928;00:23:53,764;and love of his children.
287;00:23:53,798;00:23:55,800;What is it
287;00:23:53,798;00:23:55,800;that you want from me?
288;00:23:55,834;00:23:58,819;Your Grace, I ask you
289;00:23:58,854;00:24:01,822;to let me sell myself
289;00:23:58,854;00:24:01,822;back to Master Mighdal.
290;00:24:01,857;00:24:04,408;You want to return
290;00:24:01,857;00:24:04,408;to a man who owned you
291;00:24:04,443;00:24:06,944;like a goat
291;00:24:04,443;00:24:06,944;or a chair?
292;00:24:06,995;00:24:08,696;Please, Your Grace.
293;00:24:08,747;00:24:11,699;The young may rejoice in the new
293;00:24:08,747;00:24:11,699;world you have built for them,
294;00:24:11,750;00:24:14,752;but for those of us
294;00:24:11,750;00:24:14,752;too old to change,
295;00:24:14,786;00:24:18,856;there is only fear
295;00:24:14,786;00:24:18,856;and squalor.
296;00:24:19,824;00:24:21,792;I am not alone.
297;00:24:21,826;00:24:25,429;There are many outside waiting
297;00:24:21,826;00:24:25,429;to beg the same of you.
298;00:24:25,464;00:24:27,348;I did not take
298;00:24:25,464;00:24:27,348;this city to preside
299;00:24:27,382;00:24:29,833;over the injustice
299;00:24:27,382;00:24:29,833;I fought to destroy.
300;00:24:29,851;00:24:33,521;I took it to bring
300;00:24:29,851;00:24:33,521;people freedom.
301;00:24:33,555;00:24:37,007;But freedom means making
301;00:24:33,555;00:24:37,007;your own choices.
302;00:24:37,025;00:24:40,945;I will allow you to sign a
302;00:24:37,025;00:24:40,945;contract with your former master.
303;00:24:40,979;00:24:44,482;It may not cover a period
303;00:24:40,979;00:24:44,482;lasting longer than a year.
304;00:24:44,516;00:24:46,817;Thank you, Your Grace.
305;00:24:48,653;00:24:50,321;Thank you.
306;00:24:55,460;00:24:58,162;The masters will take
306;00:24:55,460;00:24:58,162;advantage of this situation.
307;00:24:59,714;00:25:01,499;The men serving them
308;00:25:01,533;00:25:04,134;will be slaves
308;00:25:01,533;00:25:04,134;in all but name.
309;00:25:10,875;00:25:13,143;Approach, my friend.
310;00:25:37,335;00:25:39,420;I have brought you--
311;00:25:43,608;00:25:45,543;He came from the sky.
312;00:25:47,262;00:25:49,547;The black one.
313;00:25:53,251;00:25:55,185;The winged shadow.
314;00:25:56,555;00:25:58,889;He came from
314;00:25:56,555;00:25:58,889;the sky and...
315;00:26:04,279;00:26:06,480;My girl.
316;00:26:06,531;00:26:08,148;My little girl.
317;00:26:13,238;00:26:14,455;What was her name?
318;00:26:14,489;00:26:16,540;Zala, Your Grace.
319;00:26:16,575;00:26:19,743;How old was she?
319;00:26:16,575;00:26:19,743;Three.
320;00:26:19,777;00:26:21,912;Three.
321;00:29:10,348;00:29:14,468;- They came to us from White
321;00:29:10,348;00:29:14,468;- Harbor and Barrowton,
322;00:29:14,502;00:29:18,222;from Fairmarket
322;00:29:14,502;00:29:18,222;and King's Landing,
323;00:29:18,256;00:29:20,791;from north and south,
324;00:29:20,810;00:29:23,260;from east and west.
325;00:29:24,479;00:29:28,482;They died protecting
325;00:29:24,479;00:29:28,482;men, women, and children
326;00:29:28,517;00:29:31,101;who will never know
326;00:29:28,517;00:29:31,101;their names.
327;00:29:31,135;00:29:33,687;It is for us
327;00:29:31,135;00:29:33,687;to remember them.
328;00:29:33,738;00:29:35,155;Our brothers,
329;00:29:35,191;00:29:38,358;we shall never see

330;00:29:38,409;00:29:41,695;And now their watch
330;00:29:38,409;00:29:41,695;is ended.
331;00:29:41,746;00:29:46,116;And now their watch
331;00:29:41,746;00:29:46,116;is ended.
332;00:30:57,272;00:31:00,574;Your old blind man
332;00:30:57,272;00:31:00,574;patched me up.
333;00:31:00,608;00:31:02,225;Why?
334;00:31:02,243;00:31:05,362;He's sworn to treat all
334;00:31:02,243;00:31:05,362;wounded men, friend or foe.
335;00:31:05,413;00:31:07,781;You want me alive
335;00:31:05,413;00:31:07,781;so you can torture me?
336;00:31:07,832;00:31:09,082;No one's gonna torture you.
337;00:31:09,117;00:31:12,936;So how do we die?
337;00:31:09,117;00:31:12,936;Hanging? Beheading?
338;00:31:12,971;00:31:14,922;Drop us from the top
338;00:31:12,971;00:31:14,922;of the Wall?
339;00:31:14,957;00:31:17,090;I don't know what happens

341;00:31:19,093;00:31:21,595;I suppose Stannis does.
342;00:31:21,629;00:31:23,881;He your king now?
343;00:31:23,915;00:31:26,316;I don't have a king.
344;00:31:27,635;00:31:30,854;You spent too much
344;00:31:27,635;00:31:30,854;time with us, Jon Snow.
345;00:31:31,973;00:31:34,474;You can never be

347;00:31:38,396;00:31:40,614;any words over them?
348;00:31:40,648;00:31:43,033;Words?
348;00:31:40,648;00:31:43,033;What kind of words?
349;00:31:43,067;00:31:46,370;Funeral words. I don't know
349;00:31:43,067;00:31:46,370;how the free folk do it.
350;00:31:46,404;00:31:47,988;Do what?
351;00:31:48,039;00:31:49,740;Say farewell.
352;00:31:49,774;00:31:53,410;The dead can't
352;00:31:49,774;00:31:53,410;hear us, boy.

354;00:32:04,222;00:32:06,089;Did you love her?
355;00:32:08,826;00:32:10,911;She loved you.
356;00:32:11,963;00:32:13,263;She told you?
357;00:32:13,297;00:32:14,514;No.

358;00:32:14,565;00:32:17,651;was killing you.
359;00:32:17,685;00:32:19,937;That's how I know.
360;00:32:22,657;00:32:25,158;She belongs

382;00:38:17,211;00:38:19,629;- Brandon Stark.
383;00:38:26,604;00:38:29,222;He is lost.
384;00:38:29,273;00:38:31,174;Come with me
384;00:38:29,273;00:38:31,174;or die with him.
385;00:38:31,192;00:38:33,893;Go with them.
386;00:39:37,174;00:39:38,942;They cannot follow us.
387;00:39:38,976;00:39:41,261;The power that moves them
387;00:39:38,976;00:39:41,261;is powerless here.
388;00:39:41,295;00:39:43,630;Who are you?
389;00:39:43,681;00:39:46,182;The First Men
389;00:39:43,681;00:39:46,182;called us the children,
390;00:39:46,217;00:39:49,119;but we were born
390;00:39:46,217;00:39:49,119;long before them.
391;00:39:49,153;00:39:51,688;Come, he waits for you.
392;00:41:16,223;00:41:18,691;You're the three-eyed raven?
393;00:41:22,480;00:41:25,031;I've been many things.
394;00:41:25,065;00:41:28,651;Now I am what you see.
395;00:41:30,070;00:41:33,573;My brother, he led us
395;00:41:30,070;00:41:33,573;to you and now he--
396;00:41:33,624;00:41:35,742;He knew
396;00:41:33,624;00:41:35,742;what would happen.
397;00:41:35,793;00:41:38,628;From the moment
397;00:41:35,793;00:41:38,628;he left,
398;00:41:38,662;00:41:41,664;he knew
398;00:41:38,662;00:41:41,664;and he went anyway.
399;00:41:41,698;00:41:43,216;How do you know?
400;00:41:43,250;00:41:45,201;I've been watching you.
401;00:41:45,219;00:41:47,470;All of you.
402;00:41:47,505;00:41:49,672;All of your lives.
403;00:41:49,706;00:41:52,342;With 1,000 eyes
403;00:41:49,706;00:41:52,342;and one.
404;00:41:53,978;00:41:56,980;Now you've come
404;00:41:53,978;00:41:56,980;to me at last,
405;00:41:57,014;00:41:59,516;Brandon Stark.
406;00:41:59,550;00:42:02,051;Though the hour is late.
407;00:42:02,069;00:42:05,238;I didn't want
407;00:42:02,069;00:42:05,238;anyone to die for me.
408;00:42:05,272;00:42:08,741;He died so you could find
408;00:42:05,272;00:42:08,741;what you have lost.
409;00:42:10,244;00:42:12,328;You're going to help
409;00:42:10,244;00:42:12,328;me walk again?
410;00:42:13,497;00:42:15,865;You will never
410;00:42:13,497;00:42:15,865;walk again.
411;00:42:17,618;00:42:20,620;But you will fly.
412;00:42:36,353;00:42:38,271;Podrick.
413;00:42:38,305;00:42:40,423;Podrick.
414;00:42:40,441;00:42:42,725;Where are the horses?
415;00:42:43,777;00:42:45,645;I hobbled them
415;00:42:43,777;00:42:45,645;last night.
416;00:42:45,696;00:42:47,447;What sort of hobble?
417;00:42:47,481;00:42:49,249;A figure eight
417;00:42:47,481;00:42:49,249;like you taught me.
418;00:42:49,283;00:42:51,618;If you did it
418;00:42:49,283;00:42:51,618;like I taught you,
419;00:42:51,652;00:42:52,986;then the horses
419;00:42:51,652;00:42:52,986;would be here.
420;00:42:53,037;00:42:54,537;Thieves, maybe?
421;00:42:54,572;00:42:56,990;It's at least 30 miles
421;00:42:54,572;00:42:56,990;to the Eyrie from here.
422;00:42:57,041;00:42:59,659;You're carrying
422;00:42:57,041;00:42:59,659;the saddlebags.
423;00:43:27,571;00:43:29,022;People coming.
424;00:43:30,807;00:43:33,610;You can shit later.
424;00:43:30,807;00:43:33,610;There's people coming.
425;00:43:36,096;00:43:37,497;Morning.
426;00:43:39,199;00:43:41,334;Morning.
427;00:43:42,620;00:43:44,687;I like your sword.
428;00:43:44,722;00:43:47,707;Are we getting close
428;00:43:44,722;00:43:47,707;to the Bloody Gate?
429;00:43:47,758;00:43:49,709;About 10 more miles.
430;00:43:49,760;00:43:51,594;Did you
430;00:43:49,760;00:43:51,594;hear that, Podrick?
431;00:43:51,629;00:43:54,180;Only 10 more miles
431;00:43:51,629;00:43:54,180;to the Bloody Gate.
432;00:43:55,716;00:43:57,467;Are you a knight?
433;00:43:57,501;00:43:59,469;No.
434;00:43:59,503;00:44:01,738;But you know how
434;00:43:59,503;00:44:01,738;to use that sword?
435;00:44:01,772;00:44:04,474;I do.
436;00:44:04,525;00:44:06,526;Does it have a name?
437;00:44:06,560;00:44:08,895;Oathkeeper.
438;00:44:08,946;00:44:10,697;Mine's Needle.
439;00:44:10,731;00:44:12,732;Good name.
440;00:44:15,035;00:44:16,653;Who taught you
440;00:44:15,035;00:44:16,653;how to fight?
441;00:44:16,687;00:44:19,489;My father.
442;00:44:20,691;00:44:22,575;Mine never wanted to.
443;00:44:23,961;00:44:26,546;Said fighting
443;00:44:23,961;00:44:26,546;was for boys.
444;00:44:26,580;00:44:28,581;Mine said the same.
445;00:44:28,632;00:44:30,866;But I kept fighting
445;00:44:28,632;00:44:30,866;the boys anyway.
446;00:44:30,884;00:44:33,036;Kept losing.
447;00:44:33,070;00:44:35,672;Finally my father said,
447;00:44:33,070;00:44:35,672;If you're going to do it,
448;00:44:35,706;00:44:37,507;you might as well
448;00:44:35,706;00:44:37,507;do it right.
449;00:44:41,595;00:44:43,062;Seven blessings.
450;00:44:43,097;00:44:45,598;I'm Brienne of Tarth.
450;00:44:43,097;00:44:45,598;This is Podrick Payne.
451;00:44:48,118;00:44:49,885;You want something?
452;00:44:49,903;00:44:53,189;That's Sandor Clegane.
452;00:44:49,903;00:44:53,189;The Hound.
453;00:45:03,784;00:45:06,285;You're Arya Stark.
454;00:45:06,320;00:45:09,622;I asked if you
454;00:45:06,320;00:45:09,622;wanted something.
455;00:45:09,673;00:45:12,241;I swore to your mother I
455;00:45:09,673;00:45:12,241;would bring you home to her.
456;00:45:13,477;00:45:14,711;My mother's dead.
457;00:45:14,745;00:45:16,312;I know.
458;00:45:16,346;00:45:19,465;I wish I could have
458;00:45:16,346;00:45:19,465;been there to protect her.
459;00:45:20,751;00:45:22,185;You're not a northerner.
460;00:45:22,219;00:45:26,088;No, but I swore a sacred
460;00:45:22,219;00:45:26,088;vow to protect her.
461;00:45:26,106;00:45:28,141;Why didn't you?
462;00:45:31,612;00:45:34,764;She commanded me to bring Jaime
462;00:45:31,612;00:45:34,764;Lannister back to King's Landing.
463;00:45:34,783;00:45:36,532;You're paid
463;00:45:34,783;00:45:36,532;by the Lannisters.
464;00:45:36,567;00:45:39,202;You're here
464;00:45:36,567;00:45:39,202;for the bounty on me.
465;00:45:39,236;00:45:41,954;I'm not paid
465;00:45:39,236;00:45:41,954;by the Lannisters.
466;00:45:41,990;00:45:43,823;No?
467;00:45:45,209;00:45:46,993;Fancy sword
467;00:45:45,209;00:45:46,993;you've got there.
468;00:45:47,044;00:45:48,828;Where'd you get it?
469;00:45:51,498;00:45:54,250;I've been looking at
469;00:45:51,498;00:45:54,250;Lannister gold all my life.
470;00:45:56,053;00:45:58,454;Go on, Brienne
470;00:45:56,053;00:45:58,454;of fucking Tarth.
471;00:45:58,472;00:46:01,090;Tell me that's not
471;00:45:58,472;00:46:01,090;Lannister gold.
472;00:46:02,226;00:46:05,144;Jaime Lannister
472;00:46:02,226;00:46:05,144;gave me this sword.
473;00:46:05,179;00:46:06,979;The Bloody Gate
473;00:46:05,179;00:46:06,979;is 10 miles.
474;00:46:07,014;00:46:08,815;I swore to your mother
474;00:46:07,014;00:46:08,815;by the old gods--
475;00:46:08,849;00:46:10,132;I don't care
475;00:46:08,849;00:46:10,132;what you swore.
476;00:46:10,150;00:46:11,851;Arya!
476;00:46:10,150;00:46:11,851;- You heard the girl.
477;00:46:11,902;00:46:14,854;She's not coming with you.
477;00:46:11,902;00:46:14,854;She is.
478;00:46:16,740;00:46:18,825;You're not
478;00:46:16,740;00:46:18,825;a good listener.
479;00:46:18,859;00:46:20,943;That Valyrian steel?
480;00:46:20,977;00:46:23,029;I always wanted
480;00:46:20,977;00:46:23,029;some Valyrian steel.
481;00:46:23,080;00:46:25,915;Come with me, Arya.
481;00:46:23,080;00:46:25,915;I'll take you to safety.
482;00:46:25,949;00:46:28,417;Safety?
482;00:46:25,949;00:46:28,417;Where the fuck's that?
483;00:46:28,452;00:46:31,020;Her aunt in the Eyrie is dead.
483;00:46:28,452;00:46:31,020;Her mother's dead.
484;00:46:31,054;00:46:33,039;Her father's dead.
484;00:46:31,054;00:46:33,039;Her brother's dead.
485;00:46:33,090;00:46:35,208;Winterfell is a pile
485;00:46:33,090;00:46:35,208;of rubble.
486;00:46:35,259;00:46:37,593;There is no safety,
486;00:46:35,259;00:46:37,593;you dumb bitch.
487;00:46:38,879;00:46:40,379;You don't know
487;00:46:38,879;00:46:40,379;that by now,
488;00:46:40,430;00:46:43,015;you're the wrong one
488;00:46:40,430;00:46:43,015;to watch over her.
489;00:46:43,050;00:46:45,017;And that's what
489;00:46:43,050;00:46:45,017;you're doing?
490;00:46:45,052;00:46:47,169;Watching over her?
491;00:46:47,188;00:46:50,106;Aye, that's what
491;00:46:47,188;00:46:50,106;I'm doing.
492;00:47:57,925;00:48:00,426;I have no wish
492;00:47:57,925;00:48:00,426;to kill you, Ser.
493;00:48:13,724;00:48:15,441;I'm not a knight.
494;00:49:32,602;00:49:34,720;Arya!
495;00:49:34,805;00:49:36,973;Arya!
496;00:49:38,141;00:49:40,076;Arya!
497;00:49:41,478;00:49:43,479;Where is she?
497;00:49:41,478;00:49:43,479;- She was just here.
498;00:49:43,513;00:49:44,897;Why weren't you
498;00:49:43,513;00:49:44,897;watching her?
499;00:49:44,948;00:49:47,066;I was watching you. I thought
499;00:49:44,948;00:49:47,066;you might need some help.
500;00:49:47,117;00:49:49,035;Which way, Pod?
500;00:49:47,117;00:49:49,035;Which way did she go?
501;00:49:49,069;00:49:50,903;I think that way.
502;00:49:50,954;00:49:52,855;Arya!
503;00:49:52,873;00:49:54,957;Arya!
504;00:50:23,570;00:50:25,688;You still here?
505;00:50:36,083;00:50:37,666;Big bitch saved you.
506;00:50:37,701;00:50:39,835;I don't need saving.
507;00:50:39,870;00:50:42,588;No, not you.
507;00:50:39,870;00:50:42,588;You're a real killer.
508;00:50:42,622;00:50:44,840;With your water dancing
509;00:50:44,875;00:50:46,876;and your Needle.
510;00:50:48,211;00:50:50,012;You gonna die?
511;00:50:50,047;00:50:52,798;Unless there's a maester
511;00:50:50,047;00:50:52,798;hiding behind that rock,
512;00:50:52,849;00:50:54,934;aye,
513;00:50:54,969;00:50:57,386;I'm done.
514;00:51:01,108;00:51:04,026;I'd skin you alive
514;00:51:01,108;00:51:04,026;for wine.
515;00:51:04,978;00:51:07,113;Fuck water.
516;00:51:08,482;00:51:10,649;Killed by a woman.
517;00:51:12,452;00:51:15,037;I bet you like that.
518;00:51:16,790;00:51:18,624;Go on,
519;00:51:18,658;00:51:20,709;go after her.
520;00:51:20,744;00:51:23,212;She'll help you.
521;00:51:26,416;00:51:28,551;Going it alone,
522;00:51:28,585;00:51:31,087;you won't last
522;00:51:28,585;00:51:31,087;a day out there.
523;00:51:31,121;00:51:34,006;I'll last
523;00:51:31,121;00:51:34,006;longer than you.
524;00:51:40,680;00:51:43,349;You remember where
524;00:51:40,680;00:51:43,349;the heart is?
525;00:51:50,774;00:51:52,474;Fuck it.
526;00:51:52,492;00:51:54,326;I'm ready.
527;00:51:56,446;00:51:58,914;Go on, girl.
528;00:51:58,949;00:52:01,167;Another name
528;00:51:58,949;00:52:01,167;off your list.
529;00:52:02,335;00:52:04,503;You kept
529;00:52:02,335;00:52:04,503;promising me.
530;00:52:10,660;00:52:13,129;I cut down
530;00:52:10,660;00:52:13,129;your butcher's boy.
531;00:52:13,163;00:52:15,047;The ginger.
532;00:52:16,516;00:52:18,801;He was begging
532;00:52:16,516;00:52:18,801;for mercy.
533;00:52:18,852;00:52:22,138;Please, Ser.
533;00:52:18,852;00:52:22,138;Please don't kill me.
534;00:52:22,189;00:52:24,140;Please, please.
535;00:52:25,692;00:52:28,177;Bled all over
535;00:52:25,692;00:52:28,177;my horse.
536;00:52:28,195;00:52:31,280;Saddle stunk of butcher's
536;00:52:28,195;00:52:31,280;boy for weeks.
537;00:52:33,950;00:52:35,734;And your sister.
538;00:52:37,070;00:52:39,155;Your pretty sister.
539;00:52:40,373;00:52:42,958;I should have taken her.
540;00:52:42,993;00:52:45,744;That night
540;00:52:42,993;00:52:45,744;the Blackwater burned.
541;00:52:47,330;00:52:49,498;I should have
541;00:52:47,330;00:52:49,498;fucked her bloody.
542;00:52:50,917;00:52:53,552;At least I'd have
542;00:52:50,917;00:52:53,552;one happy memory.
543;00:53:03,513;00:53:05,681;Do I have to beg you?
544;00:53:10,320;00:53:12,271;Do it.
545;00:53:16,943;00:53:18,911;Do it.
546;00:53:22,082;00:53:23,949;Do it.
547;00:53:53,647;00:53:55,864;Kill me.
548;00:53:59,035;00:54:01,537;Kill me!
549;00:54:02,872;00:54:05,407;Kill me!
550;00:54:06,609;00:54:08,110;Kill me!
551;00:54:18,388;00:54:21,056;Oh, get on with it,
551;00:54:18,388;00:54:21,056;you son of a whore.
552;00:54:21,091;00:54:23,292;Is that any way to speak
552;00:54:21,091;00:54:23,292;about our mother?
553;00:54:23,310;00:54:25,227;What are you doing?
554;00:54:25,262;00:54:26,962;What do you
554;00:54:25,262;00:54:26,962;think I'm doing?
555;00:54:26,980;00:54:28,981;A galley's waiting in the bay
555;00:54:26,980;00:54:28,981;bound for the Free Cities.
556;00:54:29,015;00:54:30,316;Who's helping you?
556;00:54:29,015;00:54:30,316;Varys.
557;00:54:30,350;00:54:32,568;Varys?
557;00:54:30,350;00:54:32,568;You have more friends than you thought.
558;00:54:44,447;00:54:45,948;There's a locked door
558;00:54:44,447;00:54:45,948;at the top of the stairs.
559;00:54:45,982;00:54:48,617;Knock on it twice,
559;00:54:45,982;00:54:48,617;then twice again.
560;00:54:49,753;00:54:51,537;Varys will open.
561;00:54:51,588;00:54:54,456;I suppose this
561;00:54:51,588;00:54:54,456;is good-bye, then.
562;00:55:09,522;00:55:11,640;Farewell, little brother.
563;00:55:13,109;00:55:16,395;Jaime.
564;00:55:16,446;00:55:19,365;Thank you for my life.
565;00:55:22,018;00:55:23,986;Quickly now.
566;00:56:43,466;00:56:45,534;Tywin?
567;00:56:48,104;00:56:50,406;My lion.
568;00:58:08,701;00:58:11,153;I'm sorry.
569;00:58:23,699;00:58:25,501;I'm sorry.
570;00:59:12,348;00:59:14,266;Tyrion.
571;00:59:15,435;00:59:17,219;Put down the crossbow.
572;00:59:20,857;00:59:23,141;Who released you?
573;00:59:24,110;00:59:25,594;Your brother,
573;00:59:24,110;00:59:25,594;I expect.
574;00:59:25,612;00:59:27,896;He always had
574;00:59:25,612;00:59:27,896;a soft spot for you.
575;00:59:29,098;00:59:31,733;Come, we'll go and talk
575;00:59:29,098;00:59:31,733;in my chambers.
576;00:59:36,155;00:59:39,124;This is how you want
576;00:59:36,155;00:59:39,124;to speak to me, hmm?
577;00:59:39,158;00:59:41,627;Shaming your father has
577;00:59:39,158;00:59:41,627;always given you pleasure.
578;00:59:41,662;00:59:43,445;All my life
579;00:59:43,463;00:59:45,998;you've wanted me dead.
580;00:59:47,717;00:59:49,751;Yes.
581;00:59:49,785;00:59:52,421;But you refused to die.
582;00:59:52,472;00:59:54,256;I respect that.
583;00:59:54,290;00:59:56,141;Even admire it.
584;00:59:56,175;00:59:58,176;You fight
584;00:59:56,175;00:59:58,176;for what's yours.
585;00:59:58,227;01:00:00,596;I'd never let them
585;00:59:58,227;01:00:00,596;execute you.
586;01:00:00,647;01:00:01,930;Is that what you fear?
587;01:00:01,981;01:00:04,816;I'll never let Ilyn Payne
587;01:00:01,981;01:00:04,816;take your head.
588;01:00:04,852;01:00:06,935;You're a Lannister.
589;01:00:08,905;01:00:11,940;You're my son.
590;01:00:13,476;01:00:15,077;I loved her.
591;01:00:15,111;01:00:17,112;Who?
592;01:00:17,146;01:00:19,531;Shae.
593;01:00:19,582;01:00:21,617;Oh, Tyrion.
594;01:00:22,869;01:00:25,370;Put down that crossbow.
594;01:00:22,869;01:00:25,370;I murdered her.
595;01:00:27,790;01:00:29,658;With my own hands.
596;01:00:32,845;01:00:36,098;It doesn't matter.
596;01:00:32,845;01:00:36,098;Doesn't matter?
597;01:00:36,132;01:00:38,717;She was a whore.
598;01:00:40,019;01:00:41,937;Say that word again...
598;01:00:40,019;01:00:41,937;And what?
599;01:00:41,971;01:00:44,389;You'll kill your own
599;01:00:41,971;01:00:44,389;father in the privy?
600;01:00:45,725;01:00:47,693;No.
601;01:00:47,728;01:00:50,011;You're my son.
602;01:00:50,029;01:00:51,730;Now, enough
602;01:00:50,029;01:00:51,730;of this nonsense.
603;01:00:51,781;01:00:55,033;I am your son and you
603;01:00:51,781;01:00:55,033;sentenced me to die.
604;01:00:55,068;01:00:58,520;You knew I didn't
604;01:00:55,068;01:00:58,520;poison Joffrey,
605;01:00:58,538;01:01:01,823;but you sentenced me
605;01:00:58,538;01:01:01,823;all the same.
606;01:01:01,857;01:01:04,459;Why?
606;01:01:01,857;01:01:04,459;Enough.
607;01:01:04,494;01:01:06,044;We'll go back
607;01:01:04,494;01:01:06,044;to my chambers
608;01:01:06,080;01:01:07,496;and speak
608;01:01:06,080;01:01:07,496;with some dignity.
609;01:01:07,530;01:01:10,365;I can't go back there.
609;01:01:07,530;01:01:10,365;She's in there.
610;01:01:10,383;01:01:11,883;You're afraid
610;01:01:10,383;01:01:11,883;of a dead whore?
611;01:01:24,313;01:01:26,181;You shot me.
612;01:01:35,108;01:01:37,359;You're no son of mine.
613;01:01:37,393;01:01:38,944;I am your son.
614;01:01:40,062;01:01:43,331;I have always
614;01:01:40,062;01:01:43,331;been your son.
615;01:01:57,263;01:01:59,631;What have you done?
616;01:02:00,767;01:02:02,884;Quickly.
617;01:02:06,189;01:02:08,890;Trust me, my friend.
617;01:02:06,189;01:02:08,890;I brought you this far.
618;01:04:03,806;01:04:05,640;I want to see
618;01:04:03,806;01:04:05,640;the captain.
619;01:04:05,675;01:04:07,342;You're seeing him.
620;01:04:07,376;01:04:09,895;I want to go north
620;01:04:07,376;01:04:09,895;to the Wall.
621;01:04:09,929;01:04:12,097;No, you don't.
622;01:04:13,099;01:04:14,432;I can pay.
623;01:04:14,483;01:04:17,936;There is nothing in the North
623;01:04:14,483;01:04:17,936;but ice and war and pirates.
624;01:04:17,987;01:04:20,272;I wouldn't need a cabin.
624;01:04:17,987;01:04:20,272;Please.
625;01:04:20,323;01:04:22,574;I could work
625;01:04:20,323;01:04:22,574;scrubbing the floors.
626;01:04:22,608;01:04:25,327;I'm not going north, child.
626;01:04:22,608;01:04:25,327;I'm going home.
627;01:04:25,361;01:04:28,747;Where's home?
627;01:04:25,361;01:04:28,747;The Free City of Braavos.
628;01:04:29,749;01:04:31,399;Wait.
628;01:04:29,749;01:04:31,399;I have something else.
629;01:04:31,417;01:04:33,118;More silver won't make
629;01:04:31,417;01:04:33,118;a difference.
630;01:04:33,169;01:04:36,504;It's not silver.
630;01:04:33,169;01:04:36,504;It's iron.
631;01:04:38,591;01:04:40,542;This...
632;01:04:44,597;01:04:45,881;How did you--
633;01:04:45,915;01:04:47,966;Valar morghulis.
634;01:04:49,518;01:04:51,803;Valar dohaeris.
635;01:04:51,854;01:04:54,689;Of course,
635;01:04:51,854;01:04:54,689;you shall have a cabin.
