38;00:04:13,679;00:04:15,546;Yah! Yah!

39;00:04:27,390;00:04:29,791;- Go, move out!

39;00:04:27,390;00:04:29,791;-  The King in the North!

40;00:04:29,826;00:04:33,094;The King in the North!

41;00:04:33,129;00:04:35,230;The King in the North!

41;00:04:33,129;00:04:35,230;The King in the North!

42;00:04:35,264;00:04:37,732;The King in the North!

42;00:04:35,264;00:04:37,732;The King in the North!

43;00:04:37,766;00:04:41,101;Here comes

43;00:04:37,766;00:04:41,101;the King in the North!

44;00:04:41,135;00:04:43,336;Here comes the King

44;00:04:41,135;00:04:43,336;in the North!

45;00:04:43,371;00:04:45,304;The King in the North!

45;00:04:43,371;00:04:45,304;The King in the North!

46;00:04:45,339;00:04:49,207;Here comes...

47;00:05:17,399;00:05:18,699;Hmm.

48;00:05:18,733;00:05:21,335;Ser Eldrick Sarsfield

48;00:05:18,733;00:05:21,335;and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

49;00:05:21,369;00:05:23,803;Ser Eldrick Sarsfield

49;00:05:21,369;00:05:23,803;and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

50;00:05:23,838;00:05:25,404;What are you doing?

51;00:05:25,439;00:05:27,306;I have a list.

52;00:05:27,340;00:05:29,374;A list of people

52;00:05:27,340;00:05:29,374;you mean to kill?

53;00:05:29,409;00:05:30,675;For laughing at me?

54;00:05:30,710;00:05:32,811;Do I look like

54;00:05:30,710;00:05:32,811;Joffrey to you?

55;00:05:32,845;00:05:34,779;No, death seems

55;00:05:32,845;00:05:34,779;a bit extreme.

56;00:05:34,813;00:05:36,880;Fear of death,

56;00:05:34,813;00:05:36,880;on the other hand...

57;00:05:36,948;00:05:38,482;You should learn

57;00:05:36,948;00:05:38,482;to ignore them.

58;00:05:38,516;00:05:40,651;My lady, people have

58;00:05:38,516;00:05:40,651;been laughing at me

59;00:05:40,685;00:05:42,486;far longer than they've

59;00:05:40,685;00:05:42,486;been laughing at you.

60;00:05:42,553;00:05:44,454;I'm the Halfman,

61;00:05:44,488;00:05:46,523;the Demon Monkey,

61;00:05:44,488;00:05:46,523;the Imp.

62;00:05:46,557;00:05:48,091;You're a Lannister.

63;00:05:48,125;00:05:51,661;I am the disgraced daughter

63;00:05:48,125;00:05:51,661;of the traitor Ned Stark.

64;00:05:51,695;00:05:54,429;The disgraced daughter

64;00:05:51,695;00:05:54,429;and the Demon Monkey.

65;00:05:54,464;00:05:56,797;We're perfect for each other.

66;00:05:59,767;00:06:01,969;So how should

66;00:05:59,767;00:06:01,969;we punish them?

67;00:06:02,036;00:06:03,604;Who? Whom?

68;00:06:03,638;00:06:06,673;Ser Eldrick Sarsfield

68;00:06:03,638;00:06:06,673;and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

69;00:06:06,707;00:06:08,341;Ah.

70;00:06:08,375;00:06:11,811;I could speak to Lord Varys

70;00:06:08,375;00:06:11,811;and learn their perversions.

71;00:06:11,845;00:06:15,314;Anyone named Desmond

71;00:06:11,845;00:06:15,314;Crakehall must be a pervert.

72;00:06:15,349;00:06:17,783;I hear that

72;00:06:15,349;00:06:17,783;you're a pervert.

73;00:06:17,817;00:06:19,084;I am the Imp.

74;00:06:19,118;00:06:20,852;I have certain standards

74;00:06:19,118;00:06:20,852;to maintain.

75;00:06:23,689;00:06:26,357;We could sheep shift

75;00:06:23,689;00:06:26,357;Lord Desmond's bed.

76;00:06:27,525;00:06:29,193;You cut a little hole

76;00:06:27,525;00:06:29,193;in his mattress

77;00:06:29,227;00:06:31,061;and you stuff

77;00:06:29,227;00:06:31,061;sheep dung inside.

78;00:06:31,095;00:06:33,963;Then you sew up the hole

78;00:06:31,095;00:06:33,963;and make his bed again.

79;00:06:33,998;00:06:36,899;His room will stink, but he won't

79;00:06:33,998;00:06:36,899;know where it's coming from.

80;00:06:36,967;00:06:38,434;Lady Sansa!

81;00:06:38,468;00:06:40,903;My sister used to do that

81;00:06:38,468;00:06:40,903;when she was angry with me.

82;00:06:40,937;00:06:43,438;And she was always

82;00:06:40,937;00:06:43,438;angry with me.

83;00:06:43,473;00:06:45,540;Why sheep shift?

84;00:06:45,575;00:06:48,976;That's the vulgar word

84;00:06:45,575;00:06:48,976;for dung.

85;00:06:49,011;00:06:50,945;My lady...

86;00:06:50,979;00:06:52,280;Well, you asked me.

87;00:06:52,314;00:06:53,681;Oh!

88;00:06:53,716;00:06:55,283;That's him!

89;00:06:56,418;00:06:58,418;My lord, my lady.

90;00:06:58,453;00:07:00,754;Your father has called

90;00:06:58,453;00:07:00,754;a meeting of the small council.

91;00:07:08,362;00:07:11,164;Killed a few

91;00:07:08,362;00:07:11,164;puppies today?

92;00:07:11,232;00:07:13,132;Show him.

93;00:07:13,200;00:07:15,134;Come on, show him.

94;00:07:19,339;00:07:22,407;Oh, apologies, my lord.

95;00:07:22,441;00:07:24,376;Old fingers.

96;00:07:32,118;00:07:35,553;Roslin caught

96;00:07:32,118;00:07:35,553;a fine fat trout.

97;00:07:35,588;00:07:39,590;Her brothers gave her

97;00:07:35,588;00:07:39,590;a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding.

98;00:07:39,624;00:07:42,426;Signed Walder Frey.

99;00:07:44,228;00:07:46,162;Is that bad poetry

100;00:07:46,197;00:07:48,297;or is it supposed

100;00:07:46,197;00:07:48,297;to mean something?

101;00:07:48,332;00:07:50,132;Robb Stark is dead.

102;00:07:50,166;00:07:53,468;And his bitch mother.

103;00:07:54,971;00:07:56,337;Write back to Lord Frey.

104;00:07:56,372;00:07:59,040;Thank him for his service

104;00:07:56,372;00:07:59,040;and command him

105;00:07:59,074;00:08:01,776;to send Robb Stark's head.

106;00:08:01,810;00:08:05,012;I'm going to serve it to Sansa

106;00:08:01,810;00:08:05,012;at my wedding feast.

107;00:08:05,046;00:08:08,581;Your Grace, Lady Sansa

107;00:08:05,046;00:08:08,581;is your aunt by marriage.

108;00:08:08,616;00:08:11,150;A joke.

108;00:08:08,616;00:08:11,150;Joffrey did not mean it.

109;00:08:11,185;00:08:12,785;Yes, I did.

110;00:08:12,819;00:08:15,654;I'm going to have it served

110;00:08:12,819;00:08:15,654;to Sansa at my wedding feast.

111;00:08:15,689;00:08:17,222;No.

112;00:08:17,256;00:08:19,791;She is no longer

112;00:08:17,256;00:08:19,791;yours to torment.

113;00:08:20,726;00:08:23,594;Everyone is mine

113;00:08:20,726;00:08:23,594;to torment.

114;00:08:25,063;00:08:27,864;You'd do well to remember that,

114;00:08:25,063;00:08:27,864;you little monster.

115;00:08:27,932;00:08:29,732;Oh, I'm a monster.

116;00:08:29,767;00:08:33,301;Perhaps you should speak

116;00:08:29,767;00:08:33,301;to me more softly, then.

117;00:08:33,336;00:08:35,637;Monsters are dangerous

118;00:08:35,671;00:08:39,673;and just now kings

118;00:08:35,671;00:08:39,673;are dying like flies.

119;00:08:46,981;00:08:49,215;I could have

119;00:08:46,981;00:08:49,215;your tongue out

120;00:08:49,249;00:08:50,749;for saying that.

121;00:08:50,817;00:08:53,685;Let him make his threats.

122;00:08:53,719;00:08:56,788;Hmm? He's a bitter

122;00:08:53,719;00:08:56,788;little man.

123;00:08:56,822;00:08:59,924;Lord Tyrion should

123;00:08:56,822;00:08:59,924;apologize immediately.

124;00:08:59,958;00:09:02,993;Unacceptable,

124;00:08:59,958;00:09:02,993;disrespectful,

125;00:09:03,027;00:09:05,161;and in very bad taste.

126;00:09:05,195;00:09:07,997;I am the king!

127;00:09:08,031;00:09:09,565;I will punish you.

128;00:09:09,599;00:09:12,100;Any man who must say,

128;00:09:09,599;00:09:12,100;I am the king

129;00:09:12,135;00:09:14,769;is no true king.

130;00:09:14,803;00:09:16,704;I'll make sure

130;00:09:14,803;00:09:16,704;you understand that

131;00:09:16,738;00:09:18,272;when I've won

131;00:09:16,738;00:09:18,272;your war for you.

132;00:09:18,307;00:09:20,975;My father won

132;00:09:18,307;00:09:20,975;the real war.

133;00:09:21,009;00:09:24,078;He killed Prince Rhaegar.

133;00:09:21,009;00:09:24,078;He took the crown

134;00:09:24,112;00:09:26,881;while you hid

134;00:09:24,112;00:09:26,881;under Casterly Rock!

135;00:09:39,627;00:09:41,494;The king is tired.

136;00:09:41,529;00:09:43,696;See him to his chambers.

137;00:09:43,730;00:09:45,965;Come along.

137;00:09:43,730;00:09:45,965;I'm not tired.

138;00:09:45,999;00:09:48,701;We have so much

138;00:09:45,999;00:09:48,701;to celebrate.

139;00:09:48,735;00:09:51,803;A wedding to plan.

139;00:09:48,735;00:09:51,803;You must rest.

140;00:09:53,406;00:09:56,675;Grand Maester, perhaps

140;00:09:53,406;00:09:56,675;some essence of nightshade

141;00:09:56,709;00:09:59,177;to help him sleep.

142;00:09:59,211;00:10:02,612;I'm not tired!

143;00:10:04,148;00:10:06,048;Come.

144;00:10:26,165;00:10:28,299;Not you.

145;00:10:35,306;00:10:37,873;You just sent the most

145;00:10:35,306;00:10:37,873;powerful man in Westeros

146;00:10:37,907;00:10:40,242;to bed without his supper.

147;00:10:40,276;00:10:43,945;You're a fool if you believe he's

147;00:10:40,276;00:10:43,945;the most powerful man in Westeros.

148;00:10:43,979;00:10:46,880;A treasonous statement.

148;00:10:43,979;00:10:46,880;Joffrey is king.

149;00:10:46,948;00:10:49,850;You really think a crown

149;00:10:46,948;00:10:49,850;gives you power?

150;00:10:51,652;00:10:53,453;No.

151;00:10:53,487;00:10:56,288;I think armies

151;00:10:53,487;00:10:56,288;give you power.

152;00:10:56,323;00:10:59,124;Mm-hmm.

152;00:10:56,323;00:10:59,124;Robb Stark had one,

153;00:10:59,158;00:11:01,092;never lost a battle,

154;00:11:01,127;00:11:03,361;and you defeated him

154;00:11:01,127;00:11:03,361;all the same.

155;00:11:03,395;00:11:06,563;Mm-hmm.

155;00:11:03,395;00:11:06,563;Oh, I know.

156;00:11:06,597;00:11:09,532;Walder Frey

156;00:11:06,597;00:11:09,532;gets all the credit.

157;00:11:09,566;00:11:11,467;Or the blame,

157;00:11:09,566;00:11:11,467;I suppose,

158;00:11:11,501;00:11:13,368;depending on

158;00:11:11,501;00:11:13,368;your allegiance.

159;00:11:14,737;00:11:16,638;Walder Frey

159;00:11:14,737;00:11:16,638;is many things,

160;00:11:16,672;00:11:18,772;but a brave man?

161;00:11:18,807;00:11:20,174;No.

162;00:11:21,409;00:11:23,543;He never would have

162;00:11:21,409;00:11:23,543;risked such an action

163;00:11:23,578;00:11:26,079;if he didn't have

163;00:11:23,578;00:11:26,079;certain assurances.

164;00:11:26,147;00:11:28,848;Which he got from me.

165;00:11:28,882;00:11:30,783;Do you disapprove?

166;00:11:30,817;00:11:32,852;I'm all for cheating.

166;00:11:30,817;00:11:32,852;This is war.

167;00:11:32,886;00:11:35,054;But to slaughter them

167;00:11:32,886;00:11:35,054;at a wedding...

168;00:11:35,088;00:11:37,789;Explain to me

168;00:11:35,088;00:11:37,789;why it is more noble

169;00:11:37,824;00:11:39,891;to kill 10,000 men

169;00:11:37,824;00:11:39,891;in battle

170;00:11:39,926;00:11:41,226;than a dozen at dinner.

171;00:11:41,260;00:11:43,261;So that's why you did it?

172;00:11:43,296;00:11:44,963;To save lives?

173;00:11:44,997;00:11:47,999;To end the war.

173;00:11:44,997;00:11:47,999;To protect the family.

174;00:11:48,033;00:11:50,901;Do you want to write a song

174;00:11:48,033;00:11:50,901;for the dead Starks?

175;00:11:50,936;00:11:53,770;Go ahead, write one.

176;00:11:53,805;00:11:57,340;I'm in this world

176;00:11:53,805;00:11:57,340;a little while longer

177;00:11:57,375;00:12:01,144;to defend the Lannisters,

177;00:11:57,375;00:12:01,144;to defend my blood.

178;00:12:01,178;00:12:03,780;The northerners

178;00:12:01,178;00:12:03,780;will never forget.

179;00:12:03,814;00:12:05,181;Good.

180;00:12:05,216;00:12:06,883;Let them remember

180;00:12:05,216;00:12:06,883;what happens

181;00:12:06,917;00:12:09,252;when they march

181;00:12:06,917;00:12:09,252;on the south.

182;00:12:11,722;00:12:13,990;All the Stark men

182;00:12:11,722;00:12:13,990;are dead.

183;00:12:14,024;00:12:16,859;Winterfell is a ruin.

184;00:12:16,893;00:12:20,762;Roose Bolton will be named

184;00:12:16,893;00:12:20,762;Warden of the North

185;00:12:20,796;00:12:25,766;until your son by Sansa

185;00:12:20,796;00:12:25,766;comes of age.

186;00:12:28,736;00:12:32,271;I believe you still have some

186;00:12:28,736;00:12:32,271;work to do on that score.

187;00:12:33,806;00:12:36,774;Do you think she'll open

187;00:12:33,806;00:12:36,774;her legs for me

188;00:12:36,808;00:12:40,211;after I tell her how we murdered

188;00:12:36,808;00:12:40,211;her mother and brother?

189;00:12:40,245;00:12:43,580;One way or another,

189;00:12:40,245;00:12:43,580;you will get that girl pregnant.

190;00:12:43,615;00:12:46,116;I will not rape her.

191;00:12:47,618;00:12:50,553;Shall I explain to you in one

191;00:12:47,618;00:12:50,553;easy lesson how the world works?

192;00:12:50,588;00:12:53,689;Use small words.

192;00:12:50,588;00:12:53,689;I'm not as bright as you.

193;00:12:53,724;00:12:56,759;The house that puts family

193;00:12:53,724;00:12:56,759;first will always defeat

194;00:12:56,793;00:12:59,194;the house that puts

194;00:12:56,793;00:12:59,194;the whims and wishes

195;00:12:59,228;00:13:02,463;of its sons

195;00:12:59,228;00:13:02,463;and daughters first.

196;00:13:02,498;00:13:04,899;A good man does

196;00:13:02,498;00:13:04,899;everything in his power

197;00:13:04,933;00:13:08,101;to better

197;00:13:04,933;00:13:08,101;his family's position

198;00:13:08,136;00:13:11,671;regardless of his own

198;00:13:08,136;00:13:11,671;selfish desires.

199;00:13:15,441;00:13:16,841;Does that amuse you?

200;00:13:16,876;00:13:19,744;No, it's a very

200;00:13:16,876;00:13:19,744;good lesson.

201;00:13:19,778;00:13:23,080;Only it's easy for you to

201;00:13:19,778;00:13:23,080;preach utter devotion to family

202;00:13:23,114;00:13:25,715;when you're making

202;00:13:23,114;00:13:25,715;all the decisions.

203;00:13:25,750;00:13:27,617;Easy for me, is it?

204;00:13:27,651;00:13:30,920;When have you ever done something

204;00:13:27,651;00:13:30,920;that wasn't in your interest

205;00:13:30,955;00:13:33,288;but solely for the benefit

205;00:13:30,955;00:13:33,288;of the family?

206;00:13:33,323;00:13:36,157;The day

206;00:13:33,323;00:13:36,157;that you were born.

207;00:13:40,428;00:13:42,496;I wanted to carry you

207;00:13:40,428;00:13:42,496;into the sea

208;00:13:42,530;00:13:44,831;and let the waves

208;00:13:42,530;00:13:44,831;wash you away.

209;00:13:47,067;00:13:49,634;Instead, I let you live.

210;00:13:50,736;00:13:53,203;And I brought you up

210;00:13:50,736;00:13:53,203;as my son.

211;00:13:57,207;00:13:59,008;Because you're a Lannister.

212;00:14:14,724;00:14:16,325;Sansa.

213;00:14:45,819;00:14:46,952;It's empty.

214;00:14:46,986;00:14:48,620;Let's find

214;00:14:46,986;00:14:48,620;a place to sleep.

215;00:14:58,163;00:15:00,330;Hodor.

216;00:15:01,733;00:15:03,233;Hodor.

217;00:15:03,267;00:15:05,969;Don't, Hodor.

218;00:15:10,340;00:15:12,174;Maybe we shouldn't

218;00:15:10,340;00:15:12,174;stay here.

219;00:15:12,208;00:15:14,843;You'd rather

219;00:15:12,208;00:15:14,843;be out there?

220;00:15:14,877;00:15:17,812;There are a lot of stories

220;00:15:14,877;00:15:17,812;about this place.

221;00:15:19,081;00:15:20,547;Horrible stories.

222;00:15:20,582;00:15:22,716;I always quite liked

222;00:15:20,582;00:15:22,716;the horrible stories.

223;00:15:22,751;00:15:25,018;So did I.

224;00:15:25,052;00:15:26,886;Once.

225;00:15:29,189;00:15:31,157;You ever heard

225;00:15:29,189;00:15:31,157;about the Rat Cook?

226;00:15:31,191;00:15:33,425;No.

226;00:15:31,191;00:15:33,425;Who's he?

227;00:15:33,460;00:15:36,628;Just a cook

227;00:15:33,460;00:15:36,628;in the Night's Watch.

228;00:15:36,662;00:15:39,097;He was angry at the king

228;00:15:36,662;00:15:39,097;for something,

229;00:15:39,131;00:15:41,032;I don't remember.

230;00:15:41,066;00:15:43,834;When the king was visiting

230;00:15:41,066;00:15:43,834;the Nightfort,

231;00:15:43,868;00:15:46,369;the cook killed

231;00:15:43,868;00:15:46,369;the king's son,

232;00:15:46,404;00:15:48,304;cooked him

232;00:15:46,404;00:15:48,304;into a big pie

233;00:15:48,338;00:15:51,841;with onions, carrots,

233;00:15:48,338;00:15:51,841;mushrooms and bacon.

234;00:15:51,875;00:15:55,844;That night he served

234;00:15:51,875;00:15:55,844;the pie to the king.

235;00:15:55,878;00:15:58,580;He liked the taste

235;00:15:55,878;00:15:58,580;of his son so much,

236;00:15:58,614;00:16:01,015;he asked for

236;00:15:58,614;00:16:01,015;a second slice.

237;00:16:03,118;00:16:06,219;The gods turned the cook

237;00:16:03,118;00:16:06,219;into a giant white rat

238;00:16:06,254;00:16:08,654;who could only eat

238;00:16:06,254;00:16:08,654;his own young.

239;00:16:08,689;00:16:11,957;He's been roaming

239;00:16:08,689;00:16:11,957;the Nightfort ever since,

240;00:16:11,992;00:16:14,293;devouring his own babies.

241;00:16:15,295;00:16:18,463;But no matter

241;00:16:15,295;00:16:18,463;what he does,

242;00:16:18,498;00:16:20,465;he's always hungry.

243;00:16:21,600;00:16:23,768;If the gods turned

243;00:16:21,600;00:16:23,768;every killer

244;00:16:23,802;00:16:25,136;into a giant white rat--

245;00:16:25,203;00:16:27,437;It wasn't for murder

245;00:16:25,203;00:16:27,437;the gods cursed the Rat Cook

246;00:16:27,472;00:16:29,806;or for serving

246;00:16:27,472;00:16:29,806;the king's son in a pie.

247;00:16:29,841;00:16:32,175;He killed a guest

247;00:16:29,841;00:16:32,175;beneath his roof.

248;00:16:34,278;00:16:36,612;That's something

248;00:16:34,278;00:16:36,612;the gods can't forgive.

249;00:16:44,219;00:16:47,955;The late Walder Frey,

249;00:16:44,219;00:16:47,955;old Tully called me

250;00:16:48,023;00:16:51,658;because I didn't get my men to

250;00:16:48,023;00:16:51,658;the Trident in time for battle.

251;00:16:51,726;00:16:53,994;He thought he was witty.

252;00:16:54,028;00:16:56,229;Look at us now, Tully.

253;00:16:56,264;00:16:59,266;You're dead,

253;00:16:56,264;00:16:59,266;your daughter's dead,

254;00:16:59,300;00:17:00,867;your grandson's dead,

255;00:17:00,902;00:17:04,070;your son spent his wedding

255;00:17:00,902;00:17:04,070;night in a dungeon

256;00:17:04,105;00:17:06,906;and I'm Lord

256;00:17:04,105;00:17:06,906;of Riverrun.

257;00:17:08,675;00:17:10,610;The Blackfish escaped.

258;00:17:12,145;00:17:14,313;An old man on the run

259;00:17:14,348;00:17:16,783;with no allies.

260;00:17:16,817;00:17:18,818;I have Tywin Lannister

260;00:17:16,817;00:17:18,818;backing me.

261;00:17:18,852;00:17:21,854;Who does he have?

261;00:17:18,852;00:17:21,854;As you say.

262;00:17:21,888;00:17:23,522;They all laughed at me,

263;00:17:23,556;00:17:25,490;all those high lords.

264;00:17:25,524;00:17:28,559;They all thought

264;00:17:25,524;00:17:28,559;they were better than me.

265;00:17:28,594;00:17:31,328;Ned Stark,

265;00:17:28,594;00:17:31,328;Hoster Tully.

266;00:17:31,396;00:17:34,898;People snigger

266;00:17:31,396;00:17:34,898;when I marry a young girl,

267;00:17:34,933;00:17:38,301;but who said a word when Jon Arryn

267;00:17:34,933;00:17:38,301;married the little Tully bitch?

268;00:17:38,335;00:17:40,370;You'll be needing

268;00:17:38,335;00:17:40,370;a new young girl.

269;00:17:40,404;00:17:42,505;Yeah.

270;00:17:42,539;00:17:45,207;Got that

270;00:17:42,539;00:17:45,207;to look forward to.

271;00:17:46,576;00:17:48,043;And you,

272;00:17:48,077;00:17:50,245;the Warden

272;00:17:48,077;00:17:50,245;of the North.

273;00:17:50,279;00:17:53,581;No more Starks

273;00:17:50,279;00:17:53,581;to bow and scrape to.

274;00:17:53,616;00:17:55,283;Must have been torture

275;00:17:55,317;00:17:57,385;following that stupid boy

275;00:17:55,317;00:17:57,385;all over the country.

276;00:17:57,419;00:18:00,588;He ignored my advice

276;00:17:57,419;00:18:00,588;at every turn.

277;00:18:00,622;00:18:02,657;If he'd been a trifle

277;00:18:00,622;00:18:02,657;less arrogant...

278;00:18:02,691;00:18:05,192;Calling himself

278;00:18:02,691;00:18:05,192;the Young Wolf.

279;00:18:05,227;00:18:06,960;How's that for pomposity?

280;00:18:08,562;00:18:11,864;Well, here's to

280;00:18:08,562;00:18:11,864;the Young Wolf!

281;00:18:11,898;00:18:14,633;Forever young.

282;00:18:20,372;00:18:23,040;Will you move to Winterfell

282;00:18:20,372;00:18:23,040;now that the war's over?

283;00:18:23,074;00:18:25,575;At some point perhaps.

284;00:18:25,610;00:18:27,777;But Winterfell's in ruins.

285;00:18:27,811;00:18:30,612;Yeah.

286;00:18:30,647;00:18:32,447;What happened up there?

287;00:18:32,481;00:18:35,516;I heard the Greyjoy boy

287;00:18:32,481;00:18:35,516;seized the place.

288;00:18:35,551;00:18:38,085;I heard he killed

288;00:18:35,551;00:18:38,085;all the ravens.

289;00:18:38,120;00:18:40,587;And after that, nothing.

290;00:18:40,655;00:18:43,590;I sent my bastard Ramsay

290;00:18:40,655;00:18:43,590;to root him out.

291;00:18:43,691;00:18:47,127;Robb Stark offered

291;00:18:43,691;00:18:47,127;amnesty for the ironborn

292;00:18:47,161;00:18:48,995;if they gave us Theon.

293;00:18:49,030;00:18:50,997;Oh. And?

294;00:18:51,031;00:18:52,598;Ramsay delivered

294;00:18:51,031;00:18:52,598;the terms.

295;00:18:52,633;00:18:56,768;The ironborn turned on Theon

295;00:18:52,633;00:18:56,768;as we knew they would.

296;00:18:56,803;00:18:59,971;They handed him over

296;00:18:56,803;00:18:59,971;trussed and hooded.

297;00:19:00,005;00:19:04,074;But Ramsay-- well...

298;00:19:04,109;00:19:06,710;Ramsay has his own way

298;00:19:04,109;00:19:06,710;of doing things.

299;00:19:07,712;00:19:09,646;Well, the girls

299;00:19:07,712;00:19:09,646;weren't lying.

300;00:19:09,680;00:19:11,581;You had

300;00:19:09,680;00:19:11,581;a good-sized cock.

301;00:19:20,056;00:19:21,722;What?

302;00:19:21,757;00:19:23,157;No.

303;00:19:25,327;00:19:27,895;Pork sausage.

304;00:19:27,929;00:19:30,263;You think I'm some

304;00:19:27,929;00:19:30,263;sort of savage?

305;00:19:41,674;00:19:45,309;People talk about

305;00:19:41,674;00:19:45,309;phantom limbs.

306;00:19:45,343;00:19:48,678;An amputee might have an itch

306;00:19:45,343;00:19:48,678;where his foot used to be.

307;00:19:48,713;00:19:51,047;So I've always wondered...

308;00:19:54,018;00:19:57,520;do eunuchs

308;00:19:54,018;00:19:57,520;have a phantom cock?

309;00:19:59,422;00:20:01,557;Next time you think

309;00:19:59,422;00:20:01,557;about naked girls,

310;00:20:01,591;00:20:04,126;would you feel an itch?

311;00:20:12,467;00:20:14,068;Sorry.

312;00:20:15,203;00:20:17,004;I shouldn't make jokes.

313;00:20:18,573;00:20:21,575;My mother taught me not

313;00:20:18,573;00:20:21,575;to throw stones at cripples.

314;00:20:25,145;00:20:28,681;But my father taught me

314;00:20:25,145;00:20:28,681;to aim for their head.

315;00:20:28,715;00:20:30,783;Kill me.

316;00:20:30,817;00:20:32,718;Sorry, what?

317;00:20:34,087;00:20:35,854;Kill me.

318;00:20:37,556;00:20:39,123;A little louder.

319;00:20:39,158;00:20:42,193;Kill me!

320;00:20:43,829;00:20:46,129;You're no good

320;00:20:43,829;00:20:46,129;to me dead.

321;00:20:46,164;00:20:48,598;We need you.

322;00:21:08,517;00:21:12,053;You don't look like

322;00:21:08,517;00:21:12,053;a Theon Greyjoy anymore.

323;00:21:13,454;00:21:15,621;That's a name

323;00:21:13,454;00:21:15,621;for a lord.

324;00:21:16,823;00:21:18,891;But you're not a lord,

325;00:21:18,925;00:21:21,159;are you?

326;00:21:21,194;00:21:24,062;You're just meat.

327;00:21:25,630;00:21:29,499;Stinking meat.

328;00:21:32,636;00:21:35,004;You reek.

329;00:21:35,038;00:21:37,807;Reek!

330;00:21:37,841;00:21:40,042;That's a good name

330;00:21:37,841;00:21:40,042;for you.

331;00:21:41,245;00:21:43,846;What's your name?

332;00:21:43,881;00:21:46,115;Theon Greyjoy.

333;00:21:51,187;00:21:53,288;What's your name?

334;00:21:55,391;00:21:57,158;Th--

335;00:21:57,193;00:21:59,660;Theon Greyjoy.

336;00:22:06,767;00:22:07,901;Please.

337;00:22:07,935;00:22:12,939;What is your name?!

338;00:22:14,440;00:22:15,941;Reek.

339;00:22:19,378;00:22:20,812;My name is...

340;00:22:22,648;00:22:24,748;Reek.

341;00:22:50,738;00:22:54,074;Hodor.

342;00:23:25,037;00:23:26,638;Don't kill me!

342;00:23:25,037;00:23:26,638;Who are you?

343;00:23:26,672;00:23:29,374;Sam! Sam!

343;00:23:26,672;00:23:29,374;Who are you?!

344;00:23:29,408;00:23:32,310;Gilly.

344;00:23:29,408;00:23:32,310;Don't hurt us.

345;00:23:32,344;00:23:34,111;Where are you going?

346;00:23:34,146;00:23:37,681;To Castle Black. I'm a brother

346;00:23:34,146;00:23:37,681;of the Night's Watch.

347;00:23:37,715;00:23:40,016;My brother, he's in the Night's--

347;00:23:37,715;00:23:40,016;Shush.

348;00:23:40,050;00:23:41,784;Who's your brother?

348;00:23:40,050;00:23:41,784;Doesn't matter.

349;00:23:50,959;00:23:53,160;You're Jon's brother.

350;00:23:53,194;00:23:55,128;The one who fell

350;00:23:53,194;00:23:55,128;from the window.

351;00:23:55,162;00:23:57,296;No, I'm not.

352;00:23:57,330;00:24:01,867;I've been around Ghost enough to

352;00:23:57,330;00:24:01,867;know a direwolf when I see one.

353;00:24:01,901;00:24:04,035;And I've heard

353;00:24:01,901;00:24:04,035;all about Hodor.

354;00:24:04,070;00:24:05,937;Hodor.

355;00:24:07,740;00:24:11,042;I'd be dead

355;00:24:07,740;00:24:11,042;if it wasn't for Jon.

356;00:24:11,076;00:24:13,110;If you're his brother,

356;00:24:11,076;00:24:13,110;you're my brother, too.

357;00:24:13,144;00:24:15,479;And anything I can do

357;00:24:13,144;00:24:15,479;to help you, I will.

358;00:24:15,514;00:24:17,882;Take us north

358;00:24:15,514;00:24:17,882;of the Wall.

359;00:24:23,188;00:24:24,522;What?

360;00:24:24,556;00:24:26,490;Why in the world

360;00:24:24,556;00:24:26,490;would you want to go--

361;00:24:26,524;00:24:28,859;I don't want to.

361;00:24:26,524;00:24:28,859;I have to.

362;00:24:28,893;00:24:30,661;How did you get

362;00:24:28,893;00:24:30,661;through the Wall?

363;00:24:30,695;00:24:33,597;Does the well lead to an underground river?

363;00:24:30,695;00:24:33,597;Is that how you came here?

364;00:24:33,631;00:24:36,066;Come with us.

365;00:24:36,101;00:24:39,970;There are steps carved into

365;00:24:36,101;00:24:39,970;the south side of the Wall.

366;00:24:40,004;00:24:41,571;Hodor can carry you

366;00:24:40,004;00:24:41,571;to the top.

367;00:24:41,605;00:24:43,672;We'll walk straight

367;00:24:41,605;00:24:43,672;to Castle Black.

368;00:24:43,707;00:24:47,142;Come with us.

368;00:24:43,707;00:24:47,142;There's nothing north but death.

369;00:24:47,177;00:24:49,544;If Jon is alive,

370;00:24:49,579;00:24:51,246;then Castle Black's

370;00:24:49,579;00:24:51,246;where he'll be.

371;00:24:51,280;00:24:53,214;It's the safest place

371;00:24:51,280;00:24:53,214;for you.

372;00:24:53,248;00:24:55,882;There's nowhere safe any longer.

372;00:24:53,248;00:24:55,882;You know that.

373;00:24:55,917;00:24:59,452;What I know

373;00:24:55,917;00:24:59,452;is what I saw.

374;00:24:59,486;00:25:01,487;And if you saw it, too,

374;00:24:59,486;00:25:01,487;you'd run the other way.

375;00:25:01,521;00:25:04,957;You saw the white walkers

375;00:25:01,521;00:25:04,957;and the army of the dead.

376;00:25:05,925;00:25:07,425;How do you know

376;00:25:05,925;00:25:07,425;all that?

377;00:25:07,459;00:25:09,993;The Night's Watch

377;00:25:07,459;00:25:09,993;can't stop them.

378;00:25:10,028;00:25:13,630;The kings of Westeros and all

378;00:25:10,028;00:25:13,630;their armies can't stop them.

379;00:25:22,639;00:25:24,840;But you're going

379;00:25:22,639;00:25:24,840;to stop them?

380;00:25:24,875;00:25:27,509;Please, Sam.

381;00:25:27,544;00:25:29,578;I have to go north.

382;00:25:31,146;00:25:33,014;I have to.

383;00:26:01,170;00:26:04,205;Balon Greyjoy,

383;00:26:01,170;00:26:04,205;Lord of the Iron Islands

384;00:26:04,239;00:26:06,507;and invader of the North.

385;00:26:06,541;00:26:08,508;I give you

385;00:26:06,541;00:26:08,508;until the full moon

386;00:26:08,543;00:26:11,811;to order all ironborn scum

386;00:26:08,543;00:26:11,811;out of the North

387;00:26:11,846;00:26:14,881;and back to those

387;00:26:11,846;00:26:14,881;shit-stained rocks

388;00:26:14,915;00:26:17,083;you call a home.

389;00:26:17,117;00:26:19,985;On the first night

389;00:26:17,117;00:26:19,985;of the full moon,

390;00:26:20,020;00:26:22,488;I will hunt down

390;00:26:20,020;00:26:22,488;every islander

391;00:26:22,522;00:26:27,058;still in our lands

391;00:26:22,522;00:26:27,058;and flay them living

392;00:26:27,093;00:26:30,561;the way I flayed

392;00:26:27,093;00:26:30,561;the 20 ironborn scum

393;00:26:30,596;00:26:32,396;I found at Winterfell.

394;00:26:32,430;00:26:36,033;In the box you'll find

394;00:26:32,430;00:26:36,033;a special gift--

395;00:26:37,101;00:26:40,170;Theon's favorite toy.

396;00:26:40,204;00:26:43,539;He cried when I took it

396;00:26:40,204;00:26:43,539;away from him.

397;00:27:03,657;00:27:07,894;Leave the North now

397;00:27:03,657;00:27:07,894;or more boxes will follow

398;00:27:07,928;00:27:10,496;with more Theon.

399;00:27:10,563;00:27:12,831;Signed Ramsay Snow,

400;00:27:12,865;00:27:14,498;natural-born son

400;00:27:12,865;00:27:14,498;of Roose Bolton,

401;00:27:14,533;00:27:17,501;Lord of the Dreadfort

401;00:27:14,533;00:27:17,501;and Warden of the North.

402;00:27:20,505;00:27:22,706;Get that

402;00:27:20,505;00:27:22,706;out of my sight.

403;00:27:28,311;00:27:31,980;Theon disobeyed

403;00:27:28,311;00:27:31,980;my orders.

404;00:27:35,485;00:27:37,853;The boy is a fool.

405;00:27:40,356;00:27:43,525;He cannot further

405;00:27:40,356;00:27:43,525;the Greyjoy line.

406;00:27:44,927;00:27:48,229;I will not give up

406;00:27:44,927;00:27:48,229;the lands I have seized,

407;00:27:48,264;00:27:50,431;the strongholds

407;00:27:48,264;00:27:50,431;I have taken.

408;00:27:50,466;00:27:52,233;Get this away from me.

409;00:27:53,202;00:27:54,669;He's your son.

410;00:27:54,703;00:27:57,538;Son?

411;00:27:57,572;00:28:00,340;He's not

411;00:27:57,572;00:28:00,340;a man anymore.

412;00:28:00,374;00:28:01,942;He's your son.

413;00:28:01,976;00:28:05,445;He's my brother.

414;00:28:05,479;00:28:06,712;He's a Greyjoy.

415;00:28:06,747;00:28:08,981;Watch yourself.

416;00:28:09,015;00:28:11,349;I've made

416;00:28:09,015;00:28:11,349;my decision.

417;00:28:16,287;00:28:18,421;And I've made mine.

418;00:28:21,325;00:28:24,593;I'm going to pick the

418;00:28:21,325;00:28:24,593;fastest ship in our fleet.

419;00:28:26,829;00:28:30,197;I'm going to choose

419;00:28:26,829;00:28:30,197;the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands.

420;00:28:30,232;00:28:32,833;Get those ropes!

421;00:28:32,867;00:28:34,734;I'm going to sail

421;00:28:32,867;00:28:34,734;up the Narrow Sea

422;00:28:34,768;00:28:37,102;all the way

422;00:28:34,768;00:28:37,102;to the Weeping Water.

423;00:28:38,304;00:28:41,440;I'm going to march

423;00:28:38,304;00:28:41,440;on the Dreadfort.

424;00:28:41,474;00:28:44,208;I'm going to find

424;00:28:41,474;00:28:44,208;my little brother

425;00:28:44,243;00:28:47,145;and I'm going

425;00:28:44,243;00:28:47,145;to bring him home.

426;00:28:52,784;00:28:54,418;What is it?

427;00:28:54,452;00:28:55,986;Dragonglass.

428;00:28:56,020;00:28:57,888;We found them

428;00:28:56,020;00:28:57,888;at the Fist.

429;00:28:57,922;00:29:01,424;Someone buried them

429;00:28:57,922;00:29:01,424;a long time ago.

430;00:29:01,459;00:29:03,593;Someone wanted us

430;00:29:01,459;00:29:03,593;to find them.

431;00:29:03,627;00:29:07,463;Why?

431;00:29:03,627;00:29:07,463;What are they for?

432;00:29:11,901;00:29:13,669;Killing white walkers.

433;00:29:13,703;00:29:15,137;How do you know that?

434;00:29:15,171;00:29:17,806;The walker came

434;00:29:15,171;00:29:17,806;for my baby.

435;00:29:18,707;00:29:20,208;And Sam...

436;00:29:20,242;00:29:23,444;But no one's killed a white

436;00:29:20,242;00:29:23,444;walker in thousands of years.

437;00:29:23,478;00:29:27,447;Well, I suppose someone

437;00:29:23,478;00:29:27,447;had to be the first.

438;00:29:27,481;00:29:29,649;Take it, Hodor.

439;00:29:36,389;00:29:38,223;And the archer.

440;00:29:43,930;00:29:46,298;I got lucky

441;00:29:46,332;00:29:48,567;with one of them.

442;00:29:48,601;00:29:50,235;There are more.

443;00:29:51,270;00:29:53,838;Many more.

444;00:29:53,872;00:29:56,373;And for every one of them,

445;00:29:56,408;00:29:58,909;the dead men,

446;00:29:58,943;00:30:00,844;more than you

446;00:29:58,943;00:30:00,844;could count.

447;00:30:04,348;00:30:06,549;I wish you'd come

447;00:30:04,348;00:30:06,549;with us.

448;00:30:06,583;00:30:09,051;I wish I could.

449;00:30:10,821;00:30:12,755;I really do.

450;00:31:00,196;00:31:02,931;How are you keeping?

451;00:31:02,965;00:31:04,765;Great.

452;00:31:04,800;00:31:06,266;Never better.

453;00:31:06,301;00:31:08,869;It was just

453;00:31:06,301;00:31:08,869;a bit of blood.

454;00:31:09,737;00:31:11,705;I should have known.

455;00:31:11,739;00:31:14,307;Every time a highborn

455;00:31:11,739;00:31:14,307;asks my name, it's trouble.

456;00:31:15,542;00:31:17,142;We're not really people

456;00:31:15,542;00:31:17,142;to you, are we?

457;00:31:17,177;00:31:18,978;Just a million different ways

457;00:31:17,177;00:31:18,978;to get what you want.

458;00:31:19,012;00:31:21,679;I'm not a highborn.

458;00:31:19,012;00:31:21,679;She called you Ser.

459;00:31:21,714;00:31:23,582;I heard it.

460;00:31:25,451;00:31:28,118;A recent state

460;00:31:25,451;00:31:28,118;of affairs.

461;00:31:31,622;00:31:35,124;I was born in Flea Bottom

461;00:31:31,622;00:31:35,124;just like you.

462;00:31:35,158;00:31:37,326;Sure, you were.

463;00:31:37,360;00:31:39,160;You're my friend.

463;00:31:37,360;00:31:39,160;You're here to help.

464;00:31:39,195;00:31:41,128;I lived below

464;00:31:39,195;00:31:41,128;the Street of Flour.

465;00:31:41,163;00:31:42,563;How far below?

466;00:31:42,597;00:31:44,764;How close to the

466;00:31:42,597;00:31:44,764;Red Keep were you?

467;00:31:46,166;00:31:48,634;The shit that poured

467;00:31:46,166;00:31:48,634;from their privy pipes

468;00:31:48,669;00:31:52,404;flowed down the side

468;00:31:48,669;00:31:52,404;of Aegon's Hill

469;00:31:52,438;00:31:56,473;along Tanner's Row and right

469;00:31:52,438;00:31:56,473;in front of my front door

470;00:31:56,507;00:31:58,642;on Gin Alley.

470;00:31:56,507;00:31:58,642;Gin Alley.

471;00:32:01,345;00:32:03,278;The Street of Steel,

472;00:32:03,313;00:32:06,615;with your armor and your knights?

472;00:32:03,313;00:32:06,615;Pfft.

473;00:32:06,649;00:32:09,083;You lived in the fancy

473;00:32:06,649;00:32:09,083;part of town.

474;00:32:13,088;00:32:15,923;And here we are now.

475;00:32:15,957;00:32:19,527;Two boys from Flea Bottom

475;00:32:15,957;00:32:19,527;in the castle of a king.

476;00:32:19,561;00:32:22,029;Yeah, we've come

476;00:32:19,561;00:32:22,029;a long way.

477;00:32:23,097;00:32:25,365;We're all

477;00:32:23,097;00:32:25,365;the same, really.

478;00:32:25,400;00:32:28,335;She went to great pains

478;00:32:25,400;00:32:28,335;to point that out to me.

479;00:32:28,369;00:32:30,671;If you mistrust

479;00:32:28,369;00:32:30,671;fancy people so much,

480;00:32:30,705;00:32:33,841;why were you in such a

480;00:32:30,705;00:32:33,841;hurry to trust her?

481;00:32:35,210;00:32:37,611;You're me.

482;00:32:37,646;00:32:39,079;Never been with a woman.

483;00:32:39,114;00:32:41,849;Never talked

483;00:32:39,114;00:32:41,849;to a woman, really.

484;00:32:41,883;00:32:43,450;And then she

484;00:32:41,883;00:32:43,450;comes at you--

485;00:32:43,484;00:32:46,586;big words, no clothes.

486;00:32:46,620;00:32:48,388;What would you have done?

487;00:32:50,057;00:32:53,692;She does know her way around a

487;00:32:50,057;00:32:53,692;man's head, I'll give her that.

488;00:32:59,331;00:33:02,100;So how'd you

488;00:32:59,331;00:33:02,100;become a lord?

489;00:33:02,134;00:33:03,734;Oh, that's a long story.

490;00:33:03,769;00:33:06,870;Better not, then.

490;00:33:03,769;00:33:06,870;I'm a bit busy.

491;00:33:10,208;00:33:12,042;Many years ago

491;00:33:10,208;00:33:12,042;I helped King Stannis

492;00:33:12,076;00:33:14,578;out of a difficult

492;00:33:12,076;00:33:14,578;situation.

493;00:33:14,612;00:33:17,914;He rewarded me

493;00:33:14,612;00:33:17,914;with a lordship.

494;00:33:17,949;00:33:20,217;And this.

495;00:33:21,986;00:33:24,320;You see?

496;00:33:24,355;00:33:26,522;Highborns.

497;00:33:29,860;00:33:32,595;I didn't want

497;00:33:29,860;00:33:32,595;to be a lord.

498;00:33:32,629;00:33:34,430;I nearly didn't accept.

499;00:33:34,464;00:33:35,898;Why did you?

500;00:33:35,932;00:33:38,901;I did it for my son.

501;00:33:38,935;00:33:41,369;I didn't want him to step

501;00:33:38,935;00:33:41,369;over a river of shit

502;00:33:41,404;00:33:43,904;every time he stepped

502;00:33:41,404;00:33:43,904;through his front door.

503;00:33:45,440;00:33:47,641;I wanted him to have

503;00:33:45,440;00:33:47,641;a better life.

504;00:33:49,644;00:33:51,211;Does he?

505;00:33:52,480;00:33:54,181;He's dead.

506;00:33:59,786;00:34:01,220;How'd he die?

507;00:34:02,789;00:34:04,589;Following me.

508;00:34:15,431;00:34:18,866;When did you come

508;00:34:15,431;00:34:18,866;to this strange country?

509;00:34:20,635;00:34:22,103;When I was 13.

510;00:34:22,170;00:34:24,071;You were only a child.

511;00:34:25,239;00:34:27,674;I stopped being a child

511;00:34:25,239;00:34:27,674;when I was nine.

512;00:34:27,709;00:34:30,443;My mother

512;00:34:27,709;00:34:30,443;made sure of that.

513;00:34:32,212;00:34:33,980;You've been

513;00:34:32,212;00:34:33,980;a good influence

514;00:34:34,014;00:34:36,315;on our mutual friend,

514;00:34:34,014;00:34:36,315;you know.

515;00:34:36,350;00:34:38,384;He used to drink

515;00:34:36,350;00:34:38,384;from sundown to sunup,

516;00:34:38,418;00:34:40,018;visit three brothels

516;00:34:38,418;00:34:40,018;a night,

517;00:34:40,053;00:34:42,587;gamble away

517;00:34:40,053;00:34:42,587;his father's money.

518;00:34:42,622;00:34:44,589;Now it's just

518;00:34:42,622;00:34:44,589;the drinking.

519;00:34:44,623;00:34:47,959;And now

519;00:34:44,623;00:34:47,959;I'm his wife's servant.

520;00:34:47,993;00:34:49,927;I brush her hair

520;00:34:47,993;00:34:49,927;and clip her nails

521;00:34:49,961;00:34:51,428;and empty

521;00:34:49,961;00:34:51,428;her chamber pot.

522;00:34:51,463;00:34:52,930;She is a sweet

522;00:34:51,463;00:34:52,930;young thing.

523;00:34:52,964;00:34:54,431;None of this

523;00:34:52,964;00:34:54,431;is her fault.

524;00:34:54,465;00:34:57,400;I love that girl.

524;00:34:54,465;00:34:57,400;I would kill for her.

525;00:34:57,434;00:34:59,368;Do you think that

525;00:34:57,434;00:34:59,368;makes it easier for me?

526;00:34:59,403;00:35:02,471;No, I expect not.

527;00:35:04,808;00:35:08,277;She's young and she's

527;00:35:04,808;00:35:08,277;beautiful and highborn.

528;00:35:08,311;00:35:10,078;We break bread

528;00:35:08,311;00:35:10,078;with them,

529;00:35:10,113;00:35:12,714;but that doesn't

529;00:35:10,113;00:35:12,714;make us family.

530;00:35:12,749;00:35:14,183;We've learned

530;00:35:12,749;00:35:14,183;their language,

531;00:35:14,217;00:35:16,752;but we'll never be

531;00:35:14,217;00:35:16,752;their countrymen.

532;00:35:18,554;00:35:21,489;If you let yourself believe

533;00:35:21,524;00:35:23,725;that a foreign girl

533;00:35:21,524;00:35:23,725;with no name

534;00:35:23,759;00:35:26,093;could spend her life with

534;00:35:23,759;00:35:26,093;the son of Tywin Lannister--

535;00:35:26,128;00:35:28,896;I have a name.

535;00:35:26,128;00:35:28,896;You have one name.

536;00:35:28,930;00:35:30,464;As do I.

537;00:35:30,498;00:35:33,500;Here only the family

537;00:35:30,498;00:35:33,500;name matters.

538;00:35:33,535;00:35:35,769;What do you want

538;00:35:33,535;00:35:35,769;from me, Lord Varys?

539;00:35:39,240;00:35:41,175;Diamonds.

540;00:35:41,209;00:35:44,144;I'd tell you to beware

540;00:35:41,209;00:35:44,144;carrying so much wealth,

541;00:35:44,178;00:35:46,546;but you know how

541;00:35:44,178;00:35:46,546;to protect yourself.

542;00:35:47,515;00:35:49,215;Get on one

542;00:35:47,515;00:35:49,215;of those ships.

543;00:35:49,250;00:35:52,018;Sail to Pentos

543;00:35:49,250;00:35:52,018;or Lys or Myr.

544;00:35:52,052;00:35:55,188;You can buy a house

544;00:35:52,052;00:35:55,188;with these diamonds,

545;00:35:55,222;00:35:57,190;a very large house.

546;00:35:57,224;00:35:59,058;Hire servants.

547;00:35:59,093;00:36:00,493;Start a new life,

548;00:36:00,527;00:36:03,029;a good life,

548;00:36:00,527;00:36:03,029;far from here.

549;00:36:03,063;00:36:06,131;The mysterious

549;00:36:03,063;00:36:06,131;foreign beauty.

550;00:36:06,166;00:36:08,167;You'll have suitors

550;00:36:06,166;00:36:08,167;lining up.

551;00:36:08,201;00:36:10,468;Why do you

551;00:36:08,201;00:36:10,468;want me to leave?

552;00:36:10,503;00:36:13,104;Tyrion Lannister is one

552;00:36:10,503;00:36:13,104;of the few people alive

553;00:36:13,138;00:36:15,206;who could make this country

553;00:36:13,138;00:36:15,206;a better place.

554;00:36:15,240;00:36:16,941;He has the mind for it,

554;00:36:15,240;00:36:16,941;he has the will,

555;00:36:16,975;00:36:18,408;he has the right

555;00:36:16,975;00:36:18,408;last name.

556;00:36:18,443;00:36:20,543;And you--

557;00:36:20,578;00:36:23,713;you are a complication.

558;00:36:24,881;00:36:27,148;I know you love him.

559;00:36:27,216;00:36:31,118;And I know it's true love not

559;00:36:27,216;00:36:31,118;bought by gold and silver.

560;00:36:31,152;00:36:33,687;I'm not asking you

560;00:36:31,152;00:36:33,687;to leave him for money.

561;00:36:33,721;00:36:36,289;I'm asking you to leave

562;00:36:36,323;00:36:39,325;because your presence

562;00:36:36,323;00:36:39,325;in the capital

563;00:36:39,359;00:36:41,727;endangers him.

564;00:36:42,896;00:36:45,363;This will never

564;00:36:42,896;00:36:45,363;be your home, my lady.

565;00:36:45,398;00:36:49,233;Find a true home

565;00:36:45,398;00:36:49,233;somewhere far from here...

566;00:36:50,569;00:36:52,769;while there's still time.

567;00:36:53,938;00:36:56,573;Lord Varys.

568;00:36:59,877;00:37:03,545;If he wants me to leave,

568;00:36:59,877;00:37:03,545;he can tell me himself.

569;00:37:12,052;00:37:13,552;Keep up.

570;00:37:13,586;00:37:16,254;I don't think

570;00:37:13,586;00:37:16,254;I can, my lord.

571;00:37:18,256;00:37:20,757;It's not easy

571;00:37:18,256;00:37:20,757;being drunk all the time.

572;00:37:21,926;00:37:25,228;Everyone would do it

572;00:37:21,926;00:37:25,228;if it were easy.

573;00:37:27,697;00:37:29,698;Leave.

574;00:37:39,041;00:37:42,342;So, enjoying

574;00:37:39,041;00:37:42,342;married life?

575;00:37:45,279;00:37:49,848;An unhappy wife is a wine

575;00:37:45,279;00:37:49,848;merchant's best friend.

576;00:37:49,882;00:37:52,249;She doesn't

576;00:37:49,882;00:37:52,249;deserve this.

577;00:37:52,284;00:37:53,784;Deserve?

578;00:37:53,818;00:37:56,720;Be careful with that.

579;00:37:56,754;00:37:59,956;Start trying to work out

579;00:37:56,754;00:37:59,956;who deserves what

580;00:37:59,990;00:38:02,391;and before long you'll spend

580;00:37:59,990;00:38:02,391;the rest of your days

581;00:38:02,425;00:38:05,661;weeping for each and every

581;00:38:02,425;00:38:05,661;person in the world.

582;00:38:05,695;00:38:09,297;There's nothing worse

582;00:38:05,695;00:38:09,297;than a late-blooming philosopher.

583;00:38:10,666;00:38:12,967;Will you be facing

583;00:38:10,666;00:38:12,967;your marriage to Ser Loras

584;00:38:13,001;00:38:16,136;with the same

584;00:38:13,001;00:38:16,136;philosophical spirit?

585;00:38:16,171;00:38:17,738;I won't be marrying

585;00:38:16,171;00:38:17,738;Ser Loras.

586;00:38:17,772;00:38:20,607;I seem to remember

586;00:38:17,772;00:38:20,607;saying something similar

587;00:38:20,641;00:38:22,608;about my own marriage.

588;00:38:22,643;00:38:24,911;You're not me.

589;00:38:26,146;00:38:28,046;You want to make things

589;00:38:26,146;00:38:28,046;better for Sansa?

590;00:38:28,081;00:38:29,815;Give her a child.

591;00:38:29,849;00:38:31,816;So you can tell Father

591;00:38:29,849;00:38:31,816;it was you

592;00:38:31,851;00:38:34,051;who finally

592;00:38:31,851;00:38:34,051;talked me into it?

593;00:38:34,086;00:38:37,187;So she can have

593;00:38:34,086;00:38:37,187;some happiness in her life.

594;00:38:37,222;00:38:38,923;You have children.

595;00:38:38,957;00:38:42,059;How happy would

595;00:38:38,957;00:38:42,059;you say you are?

596;00:38:44,896;00:38:46,663;Not very.

597;00:38:49,400;00:38:51,568;But if it weren't

597;00:38:49,400;00:38:51,568;for my children,

598;00:38:51,603;00:38:54,471;I'd have thrown myself from the

598;00:38:51,603;00:38:54,471;highest window in the Red Keep.

599;00:38:56,340;00:38:58,875;They're the reason

599;00:38:56,340;00:38:58,875;I'm alive.

600;00:38:58,909;00:39:00,977;Even Joffrey?

601;00:39:02,011;00:39:03,879;Even Joffrey.

602;00:39:07,516;00:39:09,983;He was all I had once.

603;00:39:10,018;00:39:12,652;Before Myrcella was born.

604;00:39:16,156;00:39:18,758;I used to spend hours

605;00:39:18,792;00:39:21,226;looking at him.

606;00:39:21,260;00:39:23,361;His wisps of hair.

607;00:39:24,463;00:39:27,130;His tiny little

607;00:39:24,463;00:39:27,130;hands and feet.

608;00:39:28,199;00:39:30,701;He was such

608;00:39:28,199;00:39:30,701;a jolly little fellow.

609;00:39:33,704;00:39:36,939;You always hear the terrible

609;00:39:33,704;00:39:36,939;ones were terrible babies.

610;00:39:36,973;00:39:39,741;We should have known.

610;00:39:36,973;00:39:39,741;Even then we should have known.

611;00:39:39,775;00:39:41,875;It's nonsense.

612;00:39:43,645;00:39:46,213;Whenever he was with me,

612;00:39:43,645;00:39:46,213;he was happy.

613;00:39:50,184;00:39:51,885;And no one can take that

613;00:39:50,184;00:39:51,885;away from me,

614;00:39:51,919;00:39:53,686;not even Joffrey--

615;00:39:53,720;00:39:56,321;how it feels

615;00:39:53,720;00:39:56,321;to have someone.

616;00:39:57,323;00:39:59,824;Someone of your own.

617;00:40:09,599;00:40:12,167;How long

617;00:40:09,599;00:40:12,167;does it go on?

618;00:40:14,637;00:40:17,239;Until we've dealt

618;00:40:14,637;00:40:17,239;with all our enemies.

619;00:40:18,808;00:40:21,542;Every time we deal

619;00:40:18,808;00:40:21,542;with an enemy,

620;00:40:21,576;00:40:23,644;we create two more.

621;00:40:25,213;00:40:28,548;Then I suppose it will go

621;00:40:25,213;00:40:28,548;on for quite a long time.

622;00:40:33,419;00:40:35,920;I'm telling you,

622;00:40:33,419;00:40:35,920;that's what she did.

623;00:40:38,289;00:40:41,223;Sounded like

623;00:40:38,289;00:40:41,223;a cow in heat.

624;00:40:41,258;00:40:43,692;Aye, not for long.

624;00:40:41,258;00:40:43,692;That's right.

625;00:40:43,727;00:40:45,894;Black Walder

625;00:40:43,727;00:40:45,894;shut her up right quick.

626;00:40:45,929;00:40:49,130;None of the Starks had much to

626;00:40:45,929;00:40:49,130;say about the end of that meal.

627;00:40:49,164;00:40:50,698;I'll tell you what,

627;00:40:49,164;00:40:50,698;though.

628;00:40:50,732;00:40:54,034;The hardest thing was getting that

628;00:40:50,732;00:40:54,034;wolf's head to stay on the body.

629;00:40:54,068;00:40:56,570;You sewed it on?

629;00:40:54,068;00:40:56,570;I did.

630;00:40:56,604;00:40:59,706;I bet there were 1,000 men

630;00:40:56,604;00:40:59,706;claiming they were the one.

631;00:40:59,740;00:41:01,474;It was me.

632;00:41:01,508;00:41:04,444;And Malcolm

632;00:41:01,508;00:41:04,444;and Talbott.

633;00:41:04,478;00:41:07,213;Well, the thing was so heavy,

633;00:41:04,478;00:41:07,213;it fell off the first time.

634;00:41:07,247;00:41:08,814;Took the skin

634;00:41:07,247;00:41:08,814;right with it.

635;00:41:08,848;00:41:11,817;What we ended up having to do

635;00:41:08,848;00:41:11,817;was hook the needle

636;00:41:11,852;00:41:13,419;right under

636;00:41:11,852;00:41:13,419;the collarbone.

637;00:41:13,453;00:41:16,255;Give it a nice

637;00:41:13,453;00:41:16,255;firm mooring and--

638;00:41:19,458;00:41:20,858;What do you want?

639;00:41:20,893;00:41:24,161;Mind if I keep warm?

639;00:41:20,893;00:41:24,161;Fuck off.

640;00:41:24,195;00:41:26,529;But I'm hungry.

641;00:41:26,564;00:41:29,965;Does fuck off mean something

641;00:41:26,564;00:41:29,965;different where you're from?

642;00:41:30,000;00:41:32,133;I've got money.

643;00:41:36,404;00:41:38,204;What kind of coin

643;00:41:36,404;00:41:38,204;is that?

644;00:41:38,239;00:41:40,073;It's worth a lot.

645;00:41:42,710;00:41:44,010;Sorry.

646;00:41:44,045;00:41:46,045;Little shit.

647;00:41:50,751;00:41:52,485;Fool!

648;00:42:07,400;00:42:09,935;Where did you

648;00:42:07,400;00:42:09,935;get the knife?

649;00:42:09,969;00:42:11,670;From you.

650;00:42:15,074;00:42:17,675;Is that the first man

650;00:42:15,074;00:42:17,675;you've killed?

651;00:42:17,709;00:42:19,810;The first man.

652;00:42:21,078;00:42:23,446;Next time you're going

652;00:42:21,078;00:42:23,446;to do something like that,

653;00:42:23,480;00:42:25,614;tell me first.

654;00:42:37,224;00:42:39,658;Valar morghulis.

655;00:43:08,785;00:43:11,487;Ygritte, you know

655;00:43:08,785;00:43:11,487;I didn't have a choice.

656;00:43:14,690;00:43:17,492;You always knew who I was,

657;00:43:17,526;00:43:19,360;what I am.

658;00:43:21,897;00:43:24,565;I have to go home now.

659;00:43:26,668;00:43:29,068;I know you won't hurt me.

660;00:43:30,604;00:43:32,672;You know nothing,

660;00:43:30,604;00:43:32,672;Jon Snow.

661;00:43:36,309;00:43:38,777;I do know some things.

662;00:43:39,980;00:43:41,614;I know I love you.

663;00:43:44,283;00:43:46,617;I know you love me.

664;00:43:49,254;00:43:52,090;But I have

664;00:43:49,254;00:43:52,090;to go home now.

665;00:44:32,729;00:44:35,197;I know how

665;00:44:32,729;00:44:35,197;this must look.

666;00:44:37,768;00:44:41,036;What I meant was--

666;00:44:37,768;00:44:41,036;I swear to you, my lord--

667;00:44:41,070;00:44:43,505;I'm not a lord, my dear.

668;00:44:43,539;00:44:46,241;Not for many, many years.

669;00:44:46,275;00:44:49,611;Every man who joins

669;00:44:46,275;00:44:49,611;the Night's Watch

670;00:44:49,645;00:44:53,714;renounces

670;00:44:49,645;00:44:53,714;all former titles.

671;00:44:55,383;00:44:57,617;Among other things.

672;00:45:00,520;00:45:02,422;What is your name?

673;00:45:02,456;00:45:04,123;Gilly.

674;00:45:04,158;00:45:07,460;Ah, for the gillyflower.

675;00:45:07,494;00:45:08,994;Lovely.

676;00:45:09,028;00:45:11,362;Yes, my--

677;00:45:13,432;00:45:15,066;Maester.

678;00:45:16,001;00:45:17,302;Master.

679;00:45:17,336;00:45:19,804;Maester.

680;00:45:19,838;00:45:21,806;And the child?

681;00:45:23,242;00:45:25,443;She hasn't chosen

681;00:45:23,242;00:45:25,443;a name yet.

682;00:45:25,477;00:45:27,778;His name is Sam.

683;00:45:31,250;00:45:33,484;Tarly...

684;00:45:33,519;00:45:36,920;do you remember

684;00:45:33,519;00:45:36,920;the oath you swore

685;00:45:36,955;00:45:39,522;when you joined

685;00:45:36,955;00:45:39,522;this order?

686;00:45:39,557;00:45:42,692;He's not my child,

686;00:45:39,557;00:45:42,692;Maester Aemon.

687;00:45:44,028;00:45:45,928;She's one

687;00:45:44,028;00:45:45,928;of Craster's wives.

688;00:45:50,700;00:45:54,302;I remember every word

688;00:45:50,700;00:45:54,302;of the oath.

689;00:45:55,404;00:45:58,039;Night gathers

689;00:45:55,404;00:45:58,039;and my watch begins.

690;00:45:58,074;00:46:01,909;I am the shield that guards

690;00:45:58,074;00:46:01,909;the realms of men.

691;00:46:03,979;00:46:06,580;The realms of men.

692;00:46:08,516;00:46:11,318;That means her

692;00:46:08,516;00:46:11,318;as well as us.

693;00:46:11,352;00:46:14,721;We didn't build

693;00:46:11,352;00:46:14,721;500 miles of ice walls

694;00:46:14,755;00:46:17,390;700 feet high

694;00:46:14,755;00:46:17,390;to keep out men.

695;00:46:19,493;00:46:21,728;The night is gathering,

695;00:46:19,493;00:46:21,728;Maester Aemon.

696;00:46:21,762;00:46:23,830;I've seen it.

697;00:46:23,864;00:46:26,365;It's coming

697;00:46:23,864;00:46:26,365;for all of us.

698;00:46:28,969;00:46:32,237;Gilly, you and your son

699;00:46:32,272;00:46:35,240;will be our guests

699;00:46:32,272;00:46:35,240;for the time being.

700;00:46:35,274;00:46:40,177;We certainly cannot

700;00:46:35,274;00:46:40,177;send you back

701;00:46:40,211;00:46:42,178;beyond the Wall.

702;00:46:42,213;00:46:44,714;Thank you...

703;00:46:44,748;00:46:47,116;Maester.

704;00:46:47,150;00:46:49,218;I can cook and clean

704;00:46:47,150;00:46:49,218;and I can--

705;00:46:49,252;00:46:50,919;Good.

706;00:46:50,954;00:46:55,489;Samwell, fetch a quill

706;00:46:50,954;00:46:55,489;and inkwell.

707;00:46:59,594;00:47:03,196;I hope your penmanship is

707;00:46:59,594;00:47:03,196;better than your swordplay.

708;00:47:03,230;00:47:05,331;Miles better.

709;00:47:07,000;00:47:10,902;We had 44 ravens

709;00:47:07,000;00:47:10,902;at last count.

710;00:47:10,937;00:47:14,405;Make sure

710;00:47:10,937;00:47:14,405;they're all fed.

711;00:47:14,440;00:47:17,708;Every one of them

711;00:47:14,440;00:47:17,708;flies tonight.

712;00:47:26,717;00:47:29,184;To His Grace

713;00:47:29,219;00:47:31,887;King Stannis Baratheon.

714;00:47:32,955;00:47:36,324;Invaded-- inv--

714;00:47:32,955;00:47:36,324;invit-- invited

715;00:47:36,358;00:47:40,127;to the name day

715;00:47:36,358;00:47:40,127;celebration

716;00:47:40,161;00:47:45,465;for Rylene Florent

717;00:47:45,499;00:47:47,733;on the first nigit--

718;00:47:47,768;00:47:49,735;Night.

719;00:47:49,770;00:47:52,037;First night

719;00:47:49,770;00:47:52,037;of the full moon.

720;00:47:52,071;00:47:53,505;Why is there

720;00:47:52,071;00:47:53,505;a G in night?

721;00:47:53,539;00:47:55,573;I don't know.

721;00:47:53,539;00:47:55,573;There just is.

722;00:47:56,775;00:47:58,843;Well, your father's

722;00:47:56,775;00:47:58,843;not going to go to that.

723;00:48:00,278;00:48:02,779;My books are better

723;00:48:00,278;00:48:02,779;than these boring scrolls.

724;00:48:02,813;00:48:04,814;You could read about

724;00:48:02,813;00:48:04,814;Balerion the Dread.

725;00:48:04,848;00:48:08,350;They say you can still see his skull

725;00:48:04,848;00:48:08,350;in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep.

726;00:48:08,385;00:48:10,685;I'd like to see

726;00:48:08,385;00:48:10,685;that someday.

727;00:48:10,719;00:48:14,088;I've been trying to stay out of

727;00:48:10,719;00:48:14,088;those dungeons my whole life.

728;00:48:14,122;00:48:17,691;His fangs were as long

728;00:48:14,122;00:48:17,691;as bastard swords.

729;00:48:19,027;00:48:21,061;Aye, old Balerion's

729;00:48:19,027;00:48:21,061;definitely better

730;00:48:21,095;00:48:24,230;than anything your cousin

730;00:48:21,095;00:48:24,230;Rylene's got on offer.

731;00:48:24,264;00:48:26,632;But now that I'm your

731;00:48:24,264;00:48:26,632;father's Hand again,

732;00:48:26,666;00:48:28,933;I have to keep

732;00:48:26,666;00:48:28,933;him informed.

733;00:48:30,168;00:48:32,502;The king does not have

733;00:48:30,168;00:48:32,502;time for this drudgery.

734;00:48:34,371;00:48:38,507;To all the lords

734;00:48:34,371;00:48:38,507;and knobble men of Westeros.

735;00:48:38,541;00:48:41,376;Noblemen.

735;00:48:38,541;00:48:41,376;Noblemen of Westeros,

736;00:48:41,410;00:48:45,847;the Nig--

736;00:48:41,410;00:48:45,847;the Night's Watch...

737;00:48:48,917;00:48:50,985;implores...

738;00:48:51,019;00:48:52,653;What is it?

739;00:48:57,058;00:48:58,958;Why are they

739;00:48:57,058;00:48:58,958;ringing the bells?

740;00:48:58,993;00:49:00,860;Are we being attacked?

741;00:49:00,894;00:49:03,328;Stay here.

742;00:49:03,363;00:49:05,463;Bar the door.

743;00:49:23,879;00:49:26,247;The usurper

743;00:49:23,879;00:49:26,247;Robb Stark is dead.

744;00:49:26,281;00:49:29,716;Betrayed by his bannerman.

745;00:49:29,750;00:49:33,553;And you take credit because you

745;00:49:29,750;00:49:33,553;dropped a leech into the fire?

746;00:49:33,587;00:49:35,154;I take no credit.

747;00:49:35,189;00:49:38,224;I have faith and my faith

747;00:49:35,189;00:49:38,224;has been rewarded.

748;00:49:41,427;00:49:45,730;Your Grace, the world

748;00:49:41,427;00:49:45,730;has got so far bent.

749;00:49:45,764;00:49:48,632;I've seen things

749;00:49:45,764;00:49:48,632;crawl out of nightmares,

750;00:49:48,666;00:49:50,366;but my eyes were open.

751;00:49:50,401;00:49:53,235;I don't know if Robb Stark died

751;00:49:50,401;00:49:53,235;because of the Red Woman's sorcery

752;00:49:53,270;00:49:55,470;or because at war

752;00:49:53,270;00:49:55,470;men die all the time,

753;00:49:55,504;00:49:58,672;but I do know that uniting

753;00:49:55,504;00:49:58,672;the Seven Kingdoms

754;00:49:58,707;00:50:00,374;with blood magic is wrong.

755;00:50:00,408;00:50:01,575;It is evil.

756;00:50:01,609;00:50:03,777;And you are not

756;00:50:01,609;00:50:03,777;an evil man.

757;00:50:03,811;00:50:06,513;Do you know who had this table

757;00:50:03,811;00:50:06,513;carved and painted, Ser Davos?

758;00:50:07,448;00:50:08,815;Aegon Targaryen.

759;00:50:08,849;00:50:11,484;And do you know how Aegon

759;00:50:08,849;00:50:11,484;Targaryen conquered Westeros?

760;00:50:11,518;00:50:13,552;On the back of his dragon

760;00:50:11,518;00:50:13,552;Balerion the Dread.

761;00:50:13,586;00:50:17,421;He had a smaller fleet

761;00:50:13,586;00:50:17,421;than the kings he faced

762;00:50:17,455;00:50:20,157;and a smaller army,

762;00:50:17,455;00:50:20,157;but he had three dragons.

763;00:50:20,224;00:50:22,292;Dragons are magic,

763;00:50:20,224;00:50:22,292;Ser Davos.

764;00:50:22,327;00:50:25,762;My enemies have made

764;00:50:22,327;00:50:25,762;my kingdom bleed.

765;00:50:27,698;00:50:29,732;I will not forget that.

766;00:50:29,767;00:50:32,402;I will not forgive that.

767;00:50:33,938;00:50:36,739;I will punish them

767;00:50:33,938;00:50:36,739;with any arms

768;00:50:36,773;00:50:38,074;at my disposal.

769;00:50:38,108;00:50:40,977;You do not need

769;00:50:38,108;00:50:40,977;to burn the boy.

770;00:50:41,011;00:50:44,246;If what you say is true,

771;00:50:44,281;00:50:47,350;a drop of his blood

771;00:50:44,281;00:50:47,350;killed Robb Stark--

772;00:50:47,384;00:50:50,152;And our king is still

772;00:50:47,384;00:50:50,152;no closer to the Iron Throne.

773;00:50:52,889;00:50:56,258;A great gift requires

773;00:50:52,889;00:50:56,258;a great sacrifice.

774;00:51:12,907;00:51:15,275;His name is Gendry.

775;00:51:15,309;00:51:16,943;He's a good lad.

776;00:51:18,078;00:51:20,146;A poor lad

776;00:51:18,078;00:51:20,146;from Flea Bottom

777;00:51:20,180;00:51:22,848;who happens

777;00:51:20,180;00:51:22,848;to be your nephew.

778;00:51:27,953;00:51:31,656;What is the life of one bastard

778;00:51:27,953;00:51:31,656;boy against a kingdom?

779;00:51:33,425;00:51:35,192;Everything.

780;00:51:36,127;00:51:38,328;The boy must die.

781;00:51:45,668;00:51:47,635;What are you doing?

781;00:51:45,668;00:51:47,635;You're leaving.

782;00:51:47,670;00:51:50,504;Is this some kind

782;00:51:47,670;00:51:50,504;of trick?

783;00:51:50,572;00:51:53,206;Yes, but not on you.

784;00:51:57,143;00:52:00,078;Aim for that star.

784;00:51:57,143;00:52:00,078;Don't stop.

785;00:52:00,112;00:52:02,347;There's bread and water.

785;00:52:00,112;00:52:02,347;Go slow with it.

786;00:52:02,381;00:52:04,115;If you finish it off,

787;00:52:04,149;00:52:07,418;no matter how

787;00:52:04,149;00:52:07,418;thirsty you get,

788;00:52:07,452;00:52:09,386;don't drink seawater.

789;00:52:09,420;00:52:11,421;I know not

789;00:52:09,420;00:52:11,421;to drink seawater.

790;00:52:11,455;00:52:15,125;Row for a full day and night

790;00:52:11,455;00:52:15,125;and you'll reach Rook's Rest.

791;00:52:15,159;00:52:17,894;You'll want to stop there.

791;00:52:15,159;00:52:17,894;Don't. She'll find you.

792;00:52:17,928;00:52:19,262;Where should I go?

793;00:52:19,296;00:52:20,697;You must keep the coast

793;00:52:19,296;00:52:20,697;on your left side

794;00:52:20,731;00:52:22,264;until you reach

794;00:52:20,731;00:52:22,264;King's Landing.

795;00:52:22,299;00:52:24,166;The gold cloaks

795;00:52:22,299;00:52:24,166;are looking for me.

796;00:52:24,201;00:52:25,901;They were looking

796;00:52:24,201;00:52:25,901;for me for 20 years.

797;00:52:25,935;00:52:27,902;Do they know your face?

797;00:52:25,935;00:52:27,902;No.

798;00:52:27,937;00:52:29,671;I'd worry more

798;00:52:27,937;00:52:29,671;about the Red Woman.

799;00:52:36,712;00:52:38,345;The other way.

800;00:52:42,950;00:52:44,717;You ever been

800;00:52:42,950;00:52:44,717;in a boat before?

801;00:52:44,751;00:52:46,352;No.

802;00:52:46,386;00:52:47,653;You know how to swim?

803;00:52:47,687;00:52:48,887;No.

804;00:52:48,955;00:52:50,355;Don't fall out.

805;00:52:50,389;00:52:52,891;Go on.

806;00:52:54,860;00:52:56,227;Why are you doing this?

807;00:52:56,262;00:52:58,729;Because it's right.

808;00:52:58,764;00:53:00,631;And because

808;00:52:58,764;00:53:00,631;I'm a slow learner.

809;00:53:03,301;00:53:06,837;When you get to Flea Bottom,

809;00:53:03,301;00:53:06,837;have a bowl of brown for me.

810;00:53:11,576;00:53:13,343;Horse approaching!

811;00:53:13,378;00:53:16,546;Halt! Halt!

812;00:53:34,362;00:53:36,163;Jon! Jon!

813;00:53:36,197;00:53:37,864;Jon, it's us.

814;00:53:37,899;00:53:40,200;I don't think

814;00:53:37,899;00:53:40,200;he can see us.

815;00:53:44,004;00:53:47,206;Pyp?

816;00:53:47,241;00:53:49,475;Sam?

817;00:53:49,509;00:53:52,845;Hush, now.

817;00:53:49,509;00:53:52,845;You're home.

818;00:53:54,514;00:53:57,549;Carry him inside.

818;00:53:54,514;00:53:57,549;Gently.

819;00:54:22,872;00:54:25,206;Out of the way.

820;00:54:25,241;00:54:26,875;Step aside,

820;00:54:25,241;00:54:26,875;country boy.

821;00:54:26,909;00:54:28,777;People working here.

822;00:55:13,846;00:55:15,980;Cersei.

823;00:55:34,530;00:55:36,664;You don't deny it?

824;00:55:36,698;00:55:38,699;No.

825;00:55:39,768;00:55:41,835;I let him go.

826;00:55:41,870;00:55:44,938;Your mercy

826;00:55:41,870;00:55:44,938;saved the boy's life.

827;00:55:44,972;00:55:46,773;You feel good

827;00:55:44,972;00:55:46,773;about that?

828;00:55:46,807;00:55:48,174;Aye, I do.

829;00:55:48,208;00:55:50,776;You saved one innocent.

830;00:55:50,844;00:55:54,479;How many tens of thousands

830;00:55:50,844;00:55:54,479;have you doomed?

831;00:55:57,650;00:56:00,084;There has got

831;00:55:57,650;00:56:00,084;to be another way.

832;00:56:00,118;00:56:01,552;What other way?!

833;00:56:01,586;00:56:03,387;Tell us about

833;00:56:01,586;00:56:03,387;this other way.

834;00:56:03,421;00:56:05,089;I don't know,

834;00:56:03,421;00:56:05,089;Your Grace.

835;00:56:05,123;00:56:07,891;I can't see the future

835;00:56:05,123;00:56:07,891;in the fire.

836;00:56:12,162;00:56:14,229;Very well,

836;00:56:12,162;00:56:14,229;Ser Davos Seaworth.

837;00:56:15,498;00:56:18,166;I, Stannis

837;00:56:15,498;00:56:18,166;of the House Baratheon,

838;00:56:18,200;00:56:20,535;First of My Name, Rightful King

838;00:56:18,200;00:56:20,535;of the Andals and the First Men,

839;00:56:20,569;00:56:22,470;sentence you to die.

839;00:56:20,569;00:56:22,470;I understand.

840;00:56:22,504;00:56:24,772;But since you haven't yet

840;00:56:22,504;00:56:24,772;unnamed me Hand of the King,

841;00:56:24,806;00:56:27,307;it is my duty

841;00:56:24,806;00:56:27,307;to advise you against it.

842;00:56:27,342;00:56:29,943;You're gonna need me.

842;00:56:27,342;00:56:29,943;Take him away.

843;00:56:31,379;00:56:33,113;Why am I gonna need you?

844;00:56:37,451;00:56:38,851;My king.

845;00:56:42,755;00:56:45,289;It's from Maester Aemon

845;00:56:42,755;00:56:45,289;of the Night's Watch.

846;00:56:45,324;00:56:46,958;Their Lord Commander

846;00:56:45,324;00:56:46,958;is dead.

847;00:56:46,992;00:56:49,660;Took a ranging party north

847;00:56:46,992;00:56:49,660;and never made it back.

848;00:56:49,694;00:56:51,895;One lad did, though.

849;00:56:51,929;00:56:54,564;What he saw

849;00:56:51,929;00:56:54,564;beyond the Wall--

850;00:56:54,598;00:56:57,033;it's coming

850;00:56:54,598;00:56:57,033;for all of us.

851;00:57:11,178;00:57:13,012;When did you

851;00:57:11,178;00:57:13,012;learn to read?

852;00:57:13,046;00:57:14,513;Matthos taught me

852;00:57:13,046;00:57:14,513;before he died

853;00:57:14,547;00:57:16,615;so I could be

853;00:57:14,547;00:57:16,615;of better service to you.

854;00:57:24,123;00:57:27,625;This War of Five Kings

854;00:57:24,123;00:57:27,625;means nothing.

855;00:57:28,860;00:57:32,162;The true war lies

855;00:57:28,860;00:57:32,162;to the north, my king.

856;00:57:33,264;00:57:35,598;Death marches on the Wall.

857;00:57:35,633;00:57:38,234;Only you can stop him.

858;00:57:38,269;00:57:40,336;You can't stop him alone.

859;00:57:40,370;00:57:43,071;You need someone to rebuild

859;00:57:40,370;00:57:43,071;your army for you,

860;00:57:43,106;00:57:45,640;someone to convince this lord

860;00:57:43,106;00:57:45,640;and that lord to fight for you,

861;00:57:45,675;00:57:47,742;to bring sellswords

861;00:57:45,675;00:57:47,742;and pirates to your side.

862;00:57:47,777;00:57:50,145;I've made my decision.

863;00:57:51,547;00:57:54,749;He's right.

863;00:57:51,547;00:57:54,749;You need him.

864;00:57:54,783;00:57:57,419;He has a part to play

864;00:57:54,783;00:57:57,419;in the war to come.

865;00:58:06,393;00:58:08,860;You see, Ser Davos?

866;00:58:08,895;00:58:12,263;You've been saved

866;00:58:08,895;00:58:12,263;by that fire god you like to mock.

867;00:58:15,967;00:58:18,034;You're in his army now.

868;00:58:40,920;00:58:43,422;They will come,

868;00:58:40,920;00:58:43,422;Your Grace.

869;00:58:43,456;00:58:45,357;When they're ready.

870;00:58:45,392;00:58:47,159;Perhaps they didn't

870;00:58:45,392;00:58:47,159;want to be conquered.

871;00:58:47,193;00:58:49,695;You didn't conquer them.

872;00:58:49,729;00:58:51,864;You liberated them.

873;00:58:52,999;00:58:55,334;People learn to love

873;00:58:52,999;00:58:55,334;their chains.

874;00:59:57,089;00:59:59,090;No.

875;01:00:37,025;01:00:39,326;Mhysa!

875;01:00:37,025;01:00:39,326;Mhysa!

876;01:00:39,360;01:00:42,128;Mhysa! Mhysa!

877;01:00:42,163;01:00:44,463;Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

878;01:00:45,365;01:00:47,433;What does it mean?

879;01:00:47,467;01:00:50,368;It is old Ghiscari,

879;01:00:47,467;01:00:50,368;khaleesi.

880;01:00:50,403;01:00:52,804;It means mother.

881;01:00:58,108;01:01:00,843;It's all right.

882;01:01:00,877;01:01:02,578;These people

882;01:01:00,877;01:01:02,578;won't hurt me.

883;01:01:05,082;01:01:07,750;Mhysa! Mhysa!

884;01:01:56,526;01:01:59,694;Mhysa.

885;01:02:11,205;01:02:13,806;Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
