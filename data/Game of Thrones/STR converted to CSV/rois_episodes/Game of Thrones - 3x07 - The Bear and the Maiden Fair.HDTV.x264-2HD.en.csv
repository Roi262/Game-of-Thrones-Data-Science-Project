37;00:03:37,352;00:03:39,019;How far are we?

38;00:03:39,053;00:03:41,221;About a week, I think.

39;00:03:41,255;00:03:43,790;You think?

39;00:03:41,255;00:03:43,790;You don't know?

40;00:03:43,824;00:03:47,493;When we went to Castle

40;00:03:43,824;00:03:47,493;Black, we took the kingsroad.

41;00:03:47,527;00:03:50,228;You and your roads.

42;00:03:50,263;00:03:52,730;Is that how you lot

42;00:03:50,263;00:03:52,730;do your fighting?

43;00:03:52,765;00:03:56,166;You march down the road banging

43;00:03:52,765;00:03:56,166;drums and waving banners?

44;00:03:56,201;00:03:57,834;Most of the time, yes.

45;00:03:57,869;00:04:01,538;How do the men holding

45;00:03:57,869;00:04:01,538;the banners fight?

46;00:04:01,572;00:04:03,540;They don't, really.

47;00:04:03,575;00:04:07,611;It's a great honor

47;00:04:03,575;00:04:07,611;to carry your house sigil.

48;00:04:07,646;00:04:10,714;And the drummers-- is

48;00:04:07,646;00:04:10,714;that a great honor, too?

49;00:04:10,749;00:04:13,750;Usually it's the young boys

49;00:04:10,749;00:04:13,750;banging the drums.

50;00:04:13,785;00:04:15,419;So what good are they?

51;00:04:15,453;00:04:18,856;They help the men march.

51;00:04:15,453;00:04:18,856;How?

52;00:04:18,890;00:04:22,460;Well, it's--

52;00:04:18,890;00:04:22,460;it's the rhythm.

53;00:04:22,494;00:04:24,996;Oh, you mean right foot,

53;00:04:22,494;00:04:24,996;left foot,

54;00:04:25,030;00:04:27,031;right foot,

54;00:04:25,030;00:04:27,031;left foot, right foot?

55;00:04:27,066;00:04:30,235;You need help remembering that?

56;00:04:30,269;00:04:33,505;When Mance gives the signal

56;00:04:30,269;00:04:33,505;and we hit Castle Black,

57;00:04:33,540;00:04:37,009;we won't be banging on drums

57;00:04:33,540;00:04:37,009;to let them know we're coming.

58;00:04:37,043;00:04:39,111;No.

59;00:04:40,613;00:04:42,414;No, you're just gonna

59;00:04:40,613;00:04:42,414;light the biggest fire

60;00:04:42,448;00:04:45,884;the North has ever seen to

60;00:04:42,448;00:04:45,884;let them know you're coming.

61;00:04:45,918;00:04:48,520;You know nothing, Jon Snow.

62;00:04:51,090;00:04:53,424;She's right, you don't.

63;00:04:56,394;00:04:58,729;I know you cut me

63;00:04:56,394;00:04:58,729;loose on the Wall.

64;00:04:58,763;00:05:00,497;Cut her loose, too.

65;00:05:00,531;00:05:02,565;Do you see her

65;00:05:00,531;00:05:02,565;sulking about it?

66;00:05:04,001;00:05:06,669;That's because she understands

66;00:05:04,001;00:05:06,669;the way things are.

67;00:05:08,372;00:05:11,274;And are you gonna

67;00:05:08,372;00:05:11,274;share it with me?

68;00:05:11,308;00:05:14,644;The deep wisdom you found

68;00:05:11,308;00:05:14,644;inside the head of a bird?

69;00:05:14,678;00:05:17,046;People work together

69;00:05:14,678;00:05:17,046;when it suits them.

70;00:05:17,080;00:05:18,748;They're loyal

70;00:05:17,080;00:05:18,748;when it suits them.

71;00:05:18,782;00:05:21,284;They love each other

71;00:05:18,782;00:05:21,284;when it suits them.

72;00:05:21,319;00:05:24,187;And they kill each other

72;00:05:21,319;00:05:24,187;when it suits them.

73;00:05:24,222;00:05:26,357;She knows that, you don't.

74;00:05:26,391;00:05:29,794;Which is why you'll

74;00:05:26,391;00:05:29,794;never hold onto her.

75;00:05:45,243;00:05:48,279;That rain will cost us

75;00:05:45,243;00:05:48,279;another day.

76;00:05:49,881;00:05:52,684;Frey will wait.

76;00:05:49,881;00:05:52,684;He knows we're coming.

77;00:05:52,718;00:05:54,886;Lord Walder is prickly

77;00:05:52,718;00:05:54,886;by nature.

78;00:05:54,920;00:05:57,288;Prickly?

78;00:05:54,920;00:05:57,288;That what you call it?

79;00:05:57,322;00:05:59,657;Might be the least

79;00:05:57,322;00:05:59,657;pleasant man I've ever met.

80;00:05:59,691;00:06:02,326;Yes, and that is why--

80;00:05:59,691;00:06:02,326;I've seen wet shits

81;00:06:02,394;00:06:05,529;I liked better

81;00:06:02,394;00:06:05,529;than Walder Frey.

82;00:06:08,165;00:06:10,066;Apologies, Your Grace.

83;00:06:10,101;00:06:13,169;Spent too many years around

83;00:06:10,101;00:06:13,169;lancers and pikemen.

84;00:06:13,203;00:06:16,005;I've spent the last two

84;00:06:13,203;00:06:16,005;years nursing wounded men,

85;00:06:16,039;00:06:18,207;watching them bleed and die.

86;00:06:18,241;00:06:20,276;I'm not afraid of wet shits.

87;00:06:22,079;00:06:24,547;Lord Frey will take

87;00:06:22,079;00:06:24,547;this delay as a slight.

88;00:06:24,582;00:06:26,249;He can take it as he likes.

89;00:06:26,283;00:06:28,385;He's getting

89;00:06:26,283;00:06:28,385;the wedding he wanted.

90;00:06:28,419;00:06:30,053;He's getting a wedding.

91;00:06:30,088;00:06:32,389;It was a king he wanted.

92;00:06:32,424;00:06:34,425;Edmure is the best

92;00:06:32,424;00:06:34,425;match a Frey has had

93;00:06:34,459;00:06:37,328;in the history of their house.

94;00:06:37,362;00:06:39,096;We should all get some sleep.

95;00:07:58,243;00:07:59,777;If you don't put

95;00:07:58,243;00:07:59,777;some clothes on,

96;00:07:59,811;00:08:02,313;I can't promise

96;00:07:59,811;00:08:02,313;I won't attack you again.

97;00:08:02,347;00:08:04,548;Attack. Attack.

98;00:08:26,573;00:08:28,507;Who are you writing?

99;00:08:28,541;00:08:30,943;My mother.

100;00:08:32,145;00:08:35,514;Is that Valyrian?

100;00:08:32,145;00:08:35,514;Gaaa.

101;00:08:35,548;00:08:37,349;Gaaa?

102;00:08:44,190;00:08:46,292;Say hello for me.

103;00:08:46,326;00:08:48,661;Rytsas.

104;00:08:48,695;00:08:51,898;Ritsas.

105;00:08:51,932;00:08:53,933;That was close enough.

106;00:08:56,771;00:08:59,606;Does she know

106;00:08:56,771;00:08:59,606;her daughter's a queen?

107;00:08:59,640;00:09:01,742;Not yet.

108;00:09:03,345;00:09:06,080;That will be

108;00:09:03,345;00:09:06,080;a surprise, I expect.

109;00:09:08,684;00:09:10,718;Many surprises for her.

110;00:09:14,791;00:09:17,392;How am I supposed

110;00:09:14,791;00:09:17,392;to sit here planning a war

111;00:09:17,427;00:09:19,728;when you're over there

111;00:09:17,427;00:09:19,728;looking like that?

112;00:09:23,666;00:09:26,935;Will you come with me

112;00:09:23,666;00:09:26,935;one day to Volantis?

113;00:09:26,969;00:09:29,538;When all this is over?

114;00:09:29,572;00:09:31,807;I will.

115;00:09:31,841;00:09:34,210;I promise.

116;00:09:38,415;00:09:41,918;I know she'd love to meet you.

117;00:09:42,853;00:09:45,054;And her grandchild.

118;00:09:48,359;00:09:50,860;What, now?

119;00:09:55,666;00:09:57,934;Are you certain?

120;00:09:59,603;00:10:02,105;Are you angry with me?

121;00:10:02,139;00:10:03,907;Angry?

122;00:10:07,078;00:10:09,312;You're my queen.

123;00:10:11,983;00:10:15,852;And I have your little prince

123;00:10:11,983;00:10:15,852;or princess inside me.

124;00:10:16,954;00:10:19,389;Maybe one of each.

125;00:10:19,423;00:10:21,424;Don't get greedy.

126;00:10:30,967;00:10:33,669;Can you leave the war

126;00:10:30,967;00:10:33,669;for one night?

127;00:10:35,940;00:10:38,074;I love you.

128;00:10:39,243;00:10:41,979;Do you hear me?

129;00:10:42,013;00:10:44,515;I love you.

130;00:10:58,597;00:11:01,599;Most men fuck like dogs.

131;00:11:03,802;00:11:06,236;No grace, no skill.

132;00:11:06,271;00:11:08,305;A few dozen thrusts and done.

133;00:11:08,339;00:11:11,441;You need to be patient.

133;00:11:08,339;00:11:11,441;Give her time.

134;00:11:11,475;00:11:13,743;Your cock shouldn't go near her

135;00:11:13,777;00:11:17,079;till she's slick

135;00:11:13,777;00:11:17,079;as a baby seal.

136;00:11:17,113;00:11:19,848;And then you go inside,

137;00:11:19,883;00:11:21,517;but slowly.

138;00:11:21,551;00:11:24,987;Don't jam it in like

138;00:11:21,551;00:11:24,987;you're spearing a pig.

139;00:11:25,021;00:11:26,589;Come on!

140;00:11:26,623;00:11:30,059;Hey, come on.

141;00:11:41,705;00:11:44,373;You think he

141;00:11:41,705;00:11:44,373;loves you, is that it?

142;00:11:44,408;00:11:47,243;What did he tell you? He's

142;00:11:44,408;00:11:47,243;gonna make you his lady

143;00:11:47,277;00:11:49,746;and live with you

143;00:11:47,277;00:11:49,746;in some castle?

144;00:11:49,780;00:11:52,415;No, he didn't tell me anything.

145;00:11:52,450;00:11:54,184;He barely talks.

146;00:11:54,218;00:11:56,420;I've seen you two

146;00:11:54,218;00:11:56,420;whispering in the night,

147;00:11:56,454;00:11:58,622;giggling like a pair of girls.

148;00:11:58,656;00:12:00,523;What, you're jealous?

149;00:12:00,558;00:12:02,459;Of course I'm jealous.

150;00:12:02,493;00:12:04,327;You should be

150;00:12:02,493;00:12:04,327;with one of your own.

151;00:12:04,361;00:12:06,162;And you're one of my own?

152;00:12:06,196;00:12:07,956;I've never heard

152;00:12:06,196;00:12:07,956;a kind word from your mouth.

153;00:12:07,965;00:12:11,166;You would if you were mine.

154;00:12:13,135;00:12:15,870;I'd tell you

154;00:12:13,135;00:12:15,870;that you're beautiful

155;00:12:15,905;00:12:19,241;and fierce and wild.

156;00:12:19,275;00:12:21,409;I'd be good to you.

157;00:12:24,213;00:12:26,347;You love him?

158;00:12:32,854;00:12:35,522;'Cause he's pretty?

158;00:12:32,854;00:12:35,522;Is that it?

159;00:12:35,557;00:12:38,659;You like his pretty hair

159;00:12:35,557;00:12:38,659;and his pretty eyes?

160;00:12:40,495;00:12:43,297;You think pretty is gonna make you happy?

160;00:12:40,495;00:12:43,297;Don't touch me.

161;00:12:43,331;00:12:46,534;You won't love him so much when

161;00:12:43,331;00:12:46,534;you find out what he really is.

162;00:12:49,871;00:12:53,674;Growing up at Winterfell, all

162;00:12:49,871;00:12:53,674;I ever wanted was to escape,

163;00:12:53,708;00:12:57,845;to come here to the capital.

164;00:12:57,880;00:13:00,514;See the southern knights

164;00:12:57,880;00:13:00,514;and their painted armor

165;00:13:00,549;00:13:04,018;and King's Landing

165;00:13:00,549;00:13:04,018;after dark--

166;00:13:05,320;00:13:08,556;all the candles burning

166;00:13:05,320;00:13:08,556;in all those windows.

167;00:13:10,726;00:13:12,726;I'm stupid.

168;00:13:13,595;00:13:15,229;A stupid little girl

169;00:13:15,263;00:13:18,232;with stupid dreams

169;00:13:15,263;00:13:18,232;who never learns.

170;00:13:18,266;00:13:20,200;Come on.

171;00:13:21,969;00:13:24,104;Come walk with me.

172;00:13:25,840;00:13:28,808;I remember the first time

172;00:13:25,840;00:13:28,808;I saw you in the throne room.

173;00:13:28,843;00:13:32,111;I'd never seen anyone

173;00:13:28,843;00:13:32,111;who looked so unhappy.

174;00:13:32,146;00:13:34,580;I want very much for you

174;00:13:32,146;00:13:34,580;to be happy, Sansa,

175;00:13:34,614;00:13:36,749;and so does my grandmother.

176;00:13:39,285;00:13:41,787;You would have been

176;00:13:39,285;00:13:41,787;happy at Highgarden.

177;00:13:41,821;00:13:43,355;But women in our position

178;00:13:43,390;00:13:46,392;must make the best

178;00:13:43,390;00:13:46,392;of our circumstances.

179;00:13:46,426;00:13:49,429;How do I make the best

179;00:13:46,426;00:13:49,429;of my circumstances?

180;00:13:49,463;00:13:51,731;I have to marry him.

181;00:13:53,033;00:13:56,770;Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?

181;00:13:53,033;00:13:56,770;No.

182;00:13:56,804;00:13:59,306;Has he been kind to you?

183;00:13:59,340;00:14:01,608;He's tried.

184;00:14:01,642;00:14:03,109;You don't want him, though.

185;00:14:03,144;00:14:04,444;He's a Lannister.

186;00:14:04,478;00:14:07,080;Far from the worst

186;00:14:04,478;00:14:07,080;Lannister, wouldn't you say?

187;00:14:09,083;00:14:10,317;I'm sorry.

188;00:14:10,351;00:14:13,186;Here I am complaining to you...

189;00:14:13,220;00:14:15,789;My son will be king.

190;00:14:15,823;00:14:17,291;Sons learn from their mothers.

191;00:14:17,325;00:14:20,226;I plan to teach mine

191;00:14:17,325;00:14:20,226;a great deal.

192;00:14:20,261;00:14:23,063;And your son,

192;00:14:20,261;00:14:23,063;if I'm not mistaken,

193;00:14:23,097;00:14:27,034;your son might be

193;00:14:23,097;00:14:27,034;the Lord of Casterly Rock

194;00:14:27,068;00:14:28,936;and the North someday.

195;00:14:31,139;00:14:33,240;What?

196;00:14:34,208;00:14:35,742;My son...

197;00:14:35,776;00:14:37,877;with him.

198;00:14:39,980;00:14:42,649;I'll have to--

199;00:14:42,683;00:14:44,618;we'll have to--

200;00:14:44,652;00:14:46,587;If it's the pain

200;00:14:44,652;00:14:46,587;you're worried about--

201;00:14:46,621;00:14:48,822;I'm not afraid of the pain.

202;00:14:48,856;00:14:50,958;Not after what

202;00:14:48,856;00:14:50,958;Joffrey's done to me.

203;00:14:50,992;00:14:52,593;What is it, then?

204;00:14:54,662;00:14:57,131;He's rather good-looking

204;00:14:54,662;00:14:57,131;even with the scar.

205;00:14:57,165;00:14:59,367;Especially with the scar.

206;00:14:59,401;00:15:01,802;He's a dwarf.

207;00:15:01,837;00:15:04,038;And Loras--

208;00:15:04,073;00:15:05,840;Loras.

209;00:15:08,778;00:15:11,079;Some women like tall men.

210;00:15:11,113;00:15:12,748;Some like short men.

211;00:15:12,782;00:15:15,551;Some like hairy men.

211;00:15:12,782;00:15:15,551;Some like bald men.

212;00:15:15,585;00:15:18,787;Gentle men, rough men,

212;00:15:15,585;00:15:18,787;ugly men, pretty men,

213;00:15:18,822;00:15:21,190;pretty girls.

214;00:15:21,224;00:15:24,293;Most women don't know what they

214;00:15:21,224;00:15:24,293;like until they've tried it.

215;00:15:24,327;00:15:27,963;And, sadly, so many of us

215;00:15:24,327;00:15:27,963;get to try so little

216;00:15:27,997;00:15:30,265;before we're old and gray.

217;00:15:31,734;00:15:33,335;Tyrion may surprise you.

218;00:15:33,370;00:15:37,072;From what I've heard,

218;00:15:33,370;00:15:37,072;he's quite experienced.

219;00:15:37,106;00:15:40,342;And that's a good thing?

220;00:15:40,377;00:15:41,777;It can be.

221;00:15:41,812;00:15:43,579;We're very complicated,

221;00:15:41,812;00:15:43,579;you know.

222;00:15:43,614;00:15:45,948;Pleasing us takes practice.

223;00:15:45,983;00:15:48,384;How do you know all this?

224;00:15:48,418;00:15:50,819;Did your mother teach you?

225;00:15:54,057;00:15:56,858;Yes, sweet girl.

225;00:15:54,057;00:15:56,858;My mother taught me.

226;00:16:00,263;00:16:02,365;She's a child.

227;00:16:02,399;00:16:03,933;She's a foot

227;00:16:02,399;00:16:03,933;taller than you.

228;00:16:03,967;00:16:05,768;A tall child.

229;00:16:05,802;00:16:07,837;What's the youngest

229;00:16:05,802;00:16:07,837;you've ever had?

230;00:16:07,871;00:16:09,372;Not that young.

231;00:16:09,407;00:16:11,641;How much older?

232;00:16:11,676;00:16:13,410;Older.

233;00:16:13,444;00:16:16,547;You're a lord, she's a lady.

234;00:16:16,581;00:16:18,415;And a beauty at that.

235;00:16:18,449;00:16:19,983;I don't see the problem.

236;00:16:20,018;00:16:22,286;Shae isn't going to like it.

237;00:16:22,320;00:16:24,054;Shae is a whore.

238;00:16:24,089;00:16:26,691;Are you gonna

238;00:16:24,089;00:16:26,691;marry her? Eh?

239;00:16:26,725;00:16:29,794;How did marrying a whore work

239;00:16:26,725;00:16:29,794;out for you the first time?

240;00:16:29,829;00:16:32,764;I should never have

240;00:16:29,829;00:16:32,764;told you about that.

241;00:16:32,798;00:16:36,167;You want Shae, keep her.

241;00:16:32,798;00:16:36,167;Wed one and bed the other.

242;00:16:36,202;00:16:39,371;All you have to do is get

242;00:16:36,202;00:16:39,371;a son in the Stark girl.

243;00:16:39,405;00:16:41,273;He'll be Lord

243;00:16:39,405;00:16:41,273;of Winterfell one day.

244;00:16:41,307;00:16:43,508;You can rule the North

244;00:16:41,307;00:16:43,508;in his name.

245;00:16:43,542;00:16:46,311;You'll have two women and a

245;00:16:43,542;00:16:46,311;whole kingdom of your own.

246;00:16:46,345;00:16:48,180;Two women to despise me

247;00:16:48,214;00:16:50,515;and a whole kingdom

247;00:16:48,214;00:16:50,515;to join them.

248;00:16:52,018;00:16:55,353;You waste time trying

248;00:16:52,018;00:16:55,353;to get people to love you,

249;00:16:55,388;00:16:58,156;you'll end up the most

249;00:16:55,388;00:16:58,156;popular dead man in town.

250;00:17:02,261;00:17:04,263;You want to fuck

250;00:17:02,261;00:17:04,263;that Stark girl.

251;00:17:04,297;00:17:06,898;You just don't want

251;00:17:04,297;00:17:06,898;to admit it.

252;00:17:06,933;00:17:10,836;I don't pay you to put

252;00:17:06,933;00:17:10,836;evil notions in my head.

253;00:17:10,870;00:17:13,706;The ones already there

253;00:17:10,870;00:17:13,706;don't need company.

254;00:17:13,740;00:17:16,308;You pay me to kill people

254;00:17:13,740;00:17:16,308;who bother you.

255;00:17:18,678;00:17:21,213;Evil notions come free.

256;00:17:53,344;00:17:55,279;Your Grace.

257;00:17:55,313;00:17:57,415;Grandfather.

258;00:17:57,449;00:17:59,751;You wanted to speak to me?

259;00:17:59,785;00:18:01,552;Yes.

260;00:18:01,587;00:18:05,590;I'd like a report on the

260;00:18:01,587;00:18:05,590;meetings of my small council.

261;00:18:05,625;00:18:07,693;You're welcome

261;00:18:05,625;00:18:07,693;to attend the meetings

262;00:18:07,727;00:18:09,929;of your small council,

262;00:18:07,727;00:18:09,929;Your Grace.

263;00:18:09,963;00:18:11,431;Any or all of them.

264;00:18:11,465;00:18:13,300;I've been very busy.

265;00:18:13,334;00:18:15,936;Many important matters

265;00:18:13,334;00:18:15,936;require a king's attention.

266;00:18:15,970;00:18:18,138;Of course.

267;00:18:19,273;00:18:21,708;You've been holding

267;00:18:19,273;00:18:21,708;the council meetings

268;00:18:21,742;00:18:25,311;in the Tower of the Hand instead

268;00:18:21,742;00:18:25,311;of the small council chamber.

269;00:18:25,346;00:18:27,013;I have, yes.

270;00:18:28,349;00:18:30,050;May I ask why?

271;00:18:30,084;00:18:33,086;The Tower of the Hand

271;00:18:30,084;00:18:33,086;is where I work.

272;00:18:33,121;00:18:36,289;To walk from there

272;00:18:33,121;00:18:36,289;to here would take time,

273;00:18:36,323;00:18:38,992;time I could otherwise

273;00:18:36,323;00:18:38,992;spend productively.

274;00:18:39,026;00:18:41,394;So if I wanted to attend

274;00:18:39,026;00:18:41,394;a council meeting,

275;00:18:41,429;00:18:45,298;I would now have to climb all the

275;00:18:41,429;00:18:45,298;stairs in the Tower of the Hand?

276;00:19:00,481;00:19:03,617;We could arrange

276;00:19:00,481;00:19:03,617;to have you carried.

277;00:19:06,888;00:19:08,922;Tell me about

277;00:19:06,888;00:19:08,922;the Targaryen girl

278;00:19:08,957;00:19:11,991;in the east and her dragons.

279;00:19:12,026;00:19:13,660;Where did you hear about this?

280;00:19:13,694;00:19:16,162;Is it true?

281;00:19:16,196;00:19:18,264;Apparently so.

282;00:19:20,267;00:19:24,536;Don't you think we ought

282;00:19:20,267;00:19:24,536;to do something about it?

283;00:19:25,638;00:19:27,272;When I was Hand of the King

284;00:19:27,307;00:19:29,541;under your father's

284;00:19:27,307;00:19:29,541;predecessor,

285;00:19:29,575;00:19:32,177;the skulls of all

285;00:19:29,575;00:19:32,177;the Targaryen dragons

286;00:19:32,211;00:19:34,645;were kept in this room.

287;00:19:36,114;00:19:38,415;The skull of the last of them

288;00:19:38,450;00:19:40,484;was right here.

289;00:19:40,518;00:19:43,954;It was the size of an apple.

290;00:19:45,156;00:19:47,958;And the biggest

290;00:19:45,156;00:19:47,958;was the size of a carriage.

291;00:19:48,026;00:19:50,761;Yes, and the creature

291;00:19:48,026;00:19:50,761;to whom it belonged

292;00:19:50,795;00:19:53,964;died 300 years ago.

293;00:19:53,999;00:19:56,600;Curiosities on the far

293;00:19:53,999;00:19:56,600;side of the world

294;00:19:56,635;00:19:57,968;are no threat to us.

295;00:19:58,003;00:20:01,405;But how do we know these

295;00:19:58,003;00:20:01,405;dragons are just curiosities

296;00:20:01,440;00:20:04,475;and not the beasts that brought

296;00:20:01,440;00:20:04,475;the whole world to heel?

297;00:20:04,509;00:20:07,478;Because we have been told

297;00:20:04,509;00:20:07,478;as much by the many experts

298;00:20:07,512;00:20:09,647;who serve the realm

298;00:20:07,512;00:20:09,647;by counseling the king

299;00:20:09,681;00:20:11,615;on matters about

299;00:20:09,681;00:20:11,615;which he knows nothing.

300;00:20:11,650;00:20:14,084;But I haven't been counseled.

301;00:20:14,119;00:20:17,788;You are being counseled

301;00:20:14,119;00:20:17,788;at this very moment.

302;00:20:19,491;00:20:23,027;I should be consulted

302;00:20:19,491;00:20:23,027;about such things.

303;00:20:23,061;00:20:24,562;From now on, I will see to it

304;00:20:24,596;00:20:26,664;that you are

304;00:20:24,596;00:20:26,664;appropriately consulted

305;00:20:26,698;00:20:28,966;on important matters

306;00:20:29,001;00:20:31,102;whenever necessary.

307;00:20:37,075;00:20:38,609;Your Grace.

308;00:20:51,922;00:20:53,656;Yunkai.

309;00:20:53,690;00:20:55,757;The Yellow City.

310;00:20:59,529;00:21:02,864;The Yunkish train

310;00:20:59,529;00:21:02,864;bed slaves, not soldiers.

311;00:21:02,899;00:21:04,933;We can defeat them.

312;00:21:04,967;00:21:07,402;On the field, with ease.

313;00:21:07,437;00:21:09,171;But they won't

313;00:21:07,437;00:21:09,171;meet us on the field.

314;00:21:09,205;00:21:12,374;They have provisions,

314;00:21:09,205;00:21:12,374;patience, and strong walls.

315;00:21:12,408;00:21:14,877;If they're wise, they'll

315;00:21:12,408;00:21:14,877;hide behind those walls

316;00:21:14,911;00:21:17,613;and chip away at us,

316;00:21:14,911;00:21:17,613;man by man.

317;00:21:17,647;00:21:21,617;I don't want half my army killed

317;00:21:17,647;00:21:21,617;before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.

318;00:21:21,651;00:21:24,887;We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi.

319;00:21:24,922;00:21:27,591;Taking this city will not bring

319;00:21:24,922;00:21:27,591;you any closer to Westeros

320;00:21:27,625;00:21:29,893;or the Iron Throne.

321;00:21:32,363;00:21:34,998;How many slaves

321;00:21:32,363;00:21:34,998;are there in Yunkai?

322;00:21:35,033;00:21:39,003;200,000, if not more.

323;00:21:39,037;00:21:43,040;Then we have 200,000

323;00:21:39,037;00:21:43,040;reasons to take the city.

324;00:21:46,180;00:21:48,543;_

325;00:21:48,663;00:21:53,149;_

327;00:23:23,806;00:23:25,873;Now comes the noble

327;00:23:23,806;00:23:25,873;Razdal mo Eraz

328;00:23:25,908;00:23:29,344;of that ancient

328;00:23:25,908;00:23:29,344;and honorable house,

329;00:23:29,411;00:23:31,713;master of men

329;00:23:29,411;00:23:31,713;and speaker to savages,

330;00:23:31,747;00:23:35,350;to offer terms of peace.

331;00:23:35,384;00:23:37,652;Noble lord, you are

331;00:23:35,384;00:23:37,652;in the presence

332;00:23:37,686;00:23:40,555;of Daenerys Stormborn

332;00:23:37,686;00:23:40,555;of House Targaryen,

333;00:23:40,589;00:23:43,224;Queen of the Andals

333;00:23:40,589;00:23:43,224;and the First Men,

334;00:23:43,258;00:23:45,426;Khaleesi

334;00:23:43,258;00:23:45,426;of the Great Grass Sea,

335;00:23:45,460;00:23:48,796;Breaker of Chains,

335;00:23:45,460;00:23:48,796;and Mother of Dragons.

336;00:23:49,765;00:23:53,034;You may approach.

336;00:23:49,765;00:23:53,034;Sit.

337;00:24:02,243;00:24:04,744;Will the noble lord

337;00:24:02,243;00:24:04,744;take refreshment?

338;00:24:16,222;00:24:19,759;Ancient and glorious is Yunkai.

339;00:24:19,793;00:24:21,427;Our empire was old

340;00:24:21,461;00:24:24,497;before dragons stirred

340;00:24:21,461;00:24:24,497;in old Valyria.

341;00:24:24,531;00:24:27,800;Many an army has broken

341;00:24:24,531;00:24:27,800;against our walls.

342;00:24:27,834;00:24:30,570;You shall find no easy

342;00:24:27,834;00:24:30,570;conquest here, khaleesi.

343;00:24:34,208;00:24:36,943;Good.

343;00:24:34,208;00:24:36,943;My Unsullied need practice.

344;00:24:36,977;00:24:38,945;I was told to blood them early.

345;00:24:39,012;00:24:43,150;If blood is your desire,

345;00:24:39,012;00:24:43,150;blood shall flow.

346;00:24:44,252;00:24:45,920;But why?

347;00:24:45,954;00:24:49,289;'Tis true you have committed

347;00:24:45,954;00:24:49,289;savageries in Astapor.

348;00:24:49,324;00:24:53,527;But the Yunkai are a forgiving

348;00:24:49,324;00:24:53,527;and generous people.

349;00:24:56,465;00:24:59,400;The wise masters of Yunkai

349;00:24:56,465;00:24:59,400;have sent a gift

350;00:24:59,435;00:25:01,068;for the silver queen.

351;00:25:06,842;00:25:11,479;There is far more than this awaiting

351;00:25:06,842;00:25:11,479;you on the deck of your ship.

352;00:25:11,513;00:25:13,547;My ship?

352;00:25:11,513;00:25:13,547;Yes, khaleesi.

353;00:25:13,582;00:25:16,384;As I said,

353;00:25:13,582;00:25:16,384;we are a generous people.

354;00:25:16,418;00:25:19,087;You shall have as many

354;00:25:16,418;00:25:19,087;ships as you require.

355;00:25:19,121;00:25:21,189;And what do you ask in return?

356;00:25:21,223;00:25:25,426;All we ask is that

356;00:25:21,223;00:25:25,426;you make use of these ships.

357;00:25:25,461;00:25:27,962;Sail them back to Westeros

357;00:25:25,461;00:25:27,962;where you belong

358;00:25:27,997;00:25:30,865;and leave us to conduct

358;00:25:27,997;00:25:30,865;our affairs in peace.

359;00:25:33,803;00:25:36,138;I have a gift for you as well.

360;00:25:37,106;00:25:39,541;Your life.

360;00:25:37,106;00:25:39,541;My life?

361;00:25:39,575;00:25:41,276;And the lives

361;00:25:39,575;00:25:41,276;of your wise masters.

362;00:25:41,311;00:25:44,880;But I also want

362;00:25:41,311;00:25:44,880;something in return.

363;00:25:44,914;00:25:48,484;You will release

363;00:25:44,914;00:25:48,484;every slave in Yunkai.

364;00:25:48,518;00:25:51,587;Every man, woman, and child

364;00:25:48,518;00:25:51,587;shall be given as much food,

365;00:25:51,621;00:25:53,422;clothing, and property

365;00:25:51,621;00:25:53,422;as they can carry

366;00:25:53,456;00:25:56,759;as payment for their

366;00:25:53,456;00:25:56,759;years of servitude.

367;00:25:56,793;00:25:58,827;Reject this gift,

368;00:25:58,861;00:26:01,229;and I shall show you no mercy.

369;00:26:01,264;00:26:03,265;You are mad.

370;00:26:03,299;00:26:05,100;We are not Astapor or Qarth.

371;00:26:05,134;00:26:08,336;We are Yunkai and we have

371;00:26:05,134;00:26:08,336;powerful friends.

372;00:26:08,370;00:26:12,107;Friends who would take great

372;00:26:08,370;00:26:12,107;pleasure in destroying you.

373;00:26:12,141;00:26:15,110;Those who survive,

373;00:26:12,141;00:26:15,110;we shall enslave once more.

374;00:26:15,144;00:26:17,479;Perhaps we'll make

374;00:26:15,144;00:26:17,479;a slave of you as well.

375;00:26:19,615;00:26:22,250;You swore me safe conduct.

376;00:26:22,285;00:26:26,154;I did, but my dragons

376;00:26:22,285;00:26:26,154;made no promises.

377;00:26:26,188;00:26:28,723;And you threatened

377;00:26:26,188;00:26:28,723;their mother.

378;00:26:28,758;00:26:30,926;Take the gold.

379;00:26:40,469;00:26:43,438;My gold. You gave

379;00:26:40,469;00:26:43,438;it to me, remember?

380;00:26:43,472;00:26:45,240;And I shall put it to good use.

381;00:26:45,274;00:26:48,109;You'd be wise to do the

381;00:26:45,274;00:26:48,109;same with my gift to you.

382;00:26:48,144;00:26:49,759;Now get out.

383;00:26:53,682;00:26:56,518;The Yunkish are a proud people.

384;00:26:56,552;00:26:58,120;They will not bend.

385;00:26:58,154;00:27:01,123;And what happens to things

385;00:26:58,154;00:27:01,123;that don't bend?

386;00:27:01,157;00:27:03,192;He said he had

386;00:27:01,157;00:27:03,192;powerful friends.

387;00:27:03,226;00:27:05,027;Who was he talking about?

388;00:27:05,061;00:27:07,329;I don't know.

389;00:27:07,363;00:27:09,765;Find out.

390;00:27:24,681;00:27:27,216;Chains?

391;00:27:27,251;00:27:30,487;Solid gold from the mines

391;00:27:27,251;00:27:30,487;outside Lannisport.

392;00:27:30,521;00:27:32,690;Smithed in Casterly Rock.

393;00:27:32,724;00:27:35,125;Golden chains.

394;00:27:36,528;00:27:38,763;You could buy

394;00:27:36,528;00:27:38,763;a ship with these.

395;00:27:38,797;00:27:40,531;Do I need a ship?

395;00:27:38,797;00:27:40,531;What?

396;00:27:40,566;00:27:44,369;Am I going somewhere?

396;00:27:40,566;00:27:44,369;Of course you're not going anywhere.

397;00:27:44,403;00:27:48,506;So, am I invited

397;00:27:44,403;00:27:48,506;to your wedding?

398;00:27:50,209;00:27:52,977;I didn't ask for this marriage.

399;00:27:53,012;00:27:55,514;I didn't want it.

399;00:27:53,012;00:27:55,514;No?

400;00:27:55,548;00:27:57,850;She's a beautiful girl.

400;00:27:55,548;00:27:57,850;You said so yourself.

401;00:27:57,884;00:27:59,919;That doesn't mean that--

402;00:27:59,953;00:28:02,154;this is duty, not desire.

403;00:28:02,189;00:28:04,757;Is that what you will tell

403;00:28:02,189;00:28:04,757;yourself when you fuck her?

404;00:28:04,792;00:28:06,893;I don't have a choice.

404;00:28:04,792;00:28:06,893;My father--

405;00:28:06,928;00:28:09,529;Does not rule the world.

406;00:28:12,901;00:28:15,269;We can still go

406;00:28:12,901;00:28:15,269;across the Narrow Sea.

407;00:28:15,303;00:28:17,137;What would I do there?

408;00:28:17,172;00:28:18,905;Juggle?

409;00:28:18,940;00:28:22,042;I am a Lannister

409;00:28:18,940;00:28:22,042;of Casterly Rock.

410;00:28:22,076;00:28:24,677;And I'm Shae the funny whore.

411;00:28:24,712;00:28:28,581;My feelings for you

411;00:28:24,712;00:28:28,581;have not changed.

412;00:28:28,615;00:28:31,817;I will marry Sansa Stark

412;00:28:28,615;00:28:31,817;and do my duty by her.

413;00:28:31,851;00:28:34,086;While I empty her chamber pot

414;00:28:34,120;00:28:35,888;and lick your cock

414;00:28:34,120;00:28:35,888;when you're bored?

415;00:28:35,922;00:28:38,423;I swear to you

415;00:28:35,922;00:28:38,423;it will not be like that.

416;00:28:38,458;00:28:41,259;No?

416;00:28:38,458;00:28:41,259;What will it be like?

417;00:28:42,661;00:28:46,664;I will buy you a good home

417;00:28:42,661;00:28:46,664;somewhere in the city.

418;00:28:46,699;00:28:48,867;You will have fine clothes,

419;00:28:48,901;00:28:51,670;guards to keep

419;00:28:48,901;00:28:51,670;you safe, servants.

420;00:28:53,874;00:28:56,142;Any children we might have

421;00:28:56,176;00:28:58,110;will be well provided for.

422;00:28:58,145;00:29:00,512;Children?

422;00:28:58,145;00:29:00,512;You think I want children

423;00:29:00,547;00:29:02,181;who can never see their father?

424;00:29:02,215;00:29:03,782;Who would be killed

424;00:29:02,215;00:29:03,782;in their sleep

425;00:29:03,817;00:29:06,118;if their grandfather

425;00:29:03,817;00:29:06,118;found out about them?

426;00:29:06,152;00:29:08,019;Listen.

427;00:29:08,054;00:29:10,321;Listen to me, my lady.

428;00:29:10,356;00:29:12,690;I'm not your lady.

428;00:29:10,356;00:29:12,690;You are.

429;00:29:13,725;00:29:15,960;You'll always be my lady.

430;00:29:19,831;00:29:22,199;I'm your whore.

431;00:29:22,233;00:29:25,569;And when you are tired

431;00:29:22,233;00:29:25,569;of fucking me,

432;00:29:25,603;00:29:27,704;I will be nothing.

433;00:29:57,467;00:30:00,136;What happened?

433;00:29:57,467;00:30:00,136;Wildfire.

434;00:30:01,371;00:30:03,306;I should have been here.

435;00:30:05,075;00:30:07,210;After all the running

435;00:30:05,075;00:30:07,210;and fighting,

436;00:30:07,244;00:30:10,113;here I am,

436;00:30:07,244;00:30:10,113;back where I started.

437;00:30:10,147;00:30:12,382;Do you miss it?

438;00:30:12,416;00:30:15,384;King's Landing?

438;00:30:12,416;00:30:15,384;Your father's house.

439;00:30:15,419;00:30:18,321;Never had a father.

439;00:30:15,419;00:30:18,321;Never wanted one.

440;00:30:18,355;00:30:21,924;Haven't you ever wondered

440;00:30:18,355;00:30:21,924;where your strength came from?

441;00:30:21,959;00:30:23,726;Your talent for fighting?

442;00:30:23,761;00:30:25,261;I'm lowborn.

443;00:30:25,295;00:30:27,530;As low as can be.

443;00:30:25,295;00:30:27,530;My mother was a tavern wench.

444;00:30:27,564;00:30:29,398;Mine was a slave.

445;00:30:29,433;00:30:31,434;So was I.

446;00:30:31,468;00:30:33,470;Bought and sold,

447;00:30:33,504;00:30:35,472;scourged and branded,

448;00:30:35,506;00:30:37,774;until the Lord of Light

448;00:30:35,506;00:30:37,774;reached down,

449;00:30:37,808;00:30:39,909;took me in his hand

449;00:30:37,808;00:30:39,909;and raised me up.

450;00:30:41,746;00:30:43,313;I was born in Flea Bottom.

451;00:30:43,347;00:30:45,782;Your blood is noble.

452;00:30:47,251;00:30:50,087;Are you saying my father,

453;00:30:50,121;00:30:52,623;he was some lord or...

454;00:30:52,657;00:30:53,924;There.

455;00:30:53,959;00:30:56,193;Your father's house.

456;00:31:02,934;00:31:04,602;I'm just a bastard.

457;00:31:06,805;00:31:09,908;The bastard of Robert

457;00:31:06,805;00:31:09,908;of the House Baratheon,

458;00:31:09,942;00:31:12,210;First of His Name,

458;00:31:09,942;00:31:12,210;King of the Andals

459;00:31:12,245;00:31:14,012;and the First Men.

460;00:31:14,046;00:31:17,716;Why do you think

460;00:31:14,046;00:31:17,716;the gold cloaks wanted you?

461;00:31:19,318;00:31:21,886;There is power

461;00:31:19,318;00:31:21,886;in a king's blood.

462;00:31:37,868;00:31:40,236;Come sit by the fire, child.

463;00:31:42,973;00:31:44,373;Not talking, eh?

464;00:31:44,408;00:31:46,576;That's a first.

465;00:31:46,610;00:31:48,944;I don't talk to traitors.

466;00:31:51,381;00:31:53,115;I didn't like

466;00:31:51,381;00:31:53,115;giving up the boy.

467;00:31:53,150;00:31:54,817;But you did.

468;00:31:54,851;00:31:58,020;You took the gold

468;00:31:54,851;00:31:58,020;and you gave him up.

469;00:31:59,088;00:32:02,057;The Red God

469;00:31:59,088;00:32:02,057;is the one true god.

470;00:32:02,091;00:32:04,526;You've seen his power.

471;00:32:04,560;00:32:06,761;When he commands, we obey.

472;00:32:08,430;00:32:10,798;He's not my one true god.

473;00:32:10,832;00:32:14,335;No?

473;00:32:10,832;00:32:14,335;Who's yours?

474;00:32:16,805;00:32:18,606;Death.

475;00:32:29,119;00:32:31,320;Spotted a Lannister

475;00:32:29,119;00:32:31,320;raiding party.

476;00:32:31,355;00:32:33,823;How many?

476;00:32:31,355;00:32:33,823;No more than 20.

477;00:32:33,858;00:32:36,493;How far?

477;00:32:33,858;00:32:36,493;Less than a day's ride south.

478;00:32:39,565;00:32:42,099;What do you say, boys?

478;00:32:39,565;00:32:42,099;Time for a lion hunt?

479;00:32:42,134;00:32:44,169;Yeah!

480;00:32:45,738;00:32:47,339;But what about Riverrun?

481;00:32:47,373;00:32:49,207;It's not south.

481;00:32:47,373;00:32:49,207;It's west of here.

482;00:32:49,242;00:32:51,443;It will still be west of here

482;00:32:49,242;00:32:51,443;two days from now.

483;00:32:51,477;00:32:54,613;You swore.

483;00:32:51,477;00:32:54,613;To take you home, and I will.

484;00:32:54,647;00:32:56,815;But we need to do this first.

485;00:32:56,849;00:32:58,717;Why? So you can

485;00:32:56,849;00:32:58,717;steal their gold?

486;00:32:58,751;00:33:00,285;I swear to you,

486;00:32:58,751;00:33:00,285;this isn't--

487;00:33:00,319;00:33:02,955;I don't care what you swear

487;00:33:00,319;00:33:02,955;because you're a liar.

488;00:33:02,989;00:33:04,623;You lied to Gendry,

488;00:33:02,989;00:33:04,623;you lied to me.

489;00:33:04,657;00:33:08,027;You'll lie to anyone. I hope

489;00:33:04,657;00:33:08,027;the Lannisters kill you all.

490;00:33:08,061;00:33:11,097;One day you'll understand,

490;00:33:08,061;00:33:11,097;but now--

491;00:33:13,601;00:33:16,636;Anguy, bring her back.

491;00:33:13,601;00:33:16,636;Come back, girl!

492;00:33:41,295;00:33:42,928;Kick all you like, wolf girl.

493;00:33:42,963;00:33:45,431;Won't do you no good.

494;00:34:02,548;00:34:04,616;I thought you were gone.

495;00:34:04,650;00:34:06,785;Tomorrow.

496;00:34:10,122;00:34:13,124;Have they told you what

496;00:34:10,122;00:34:13,124;they plan to do with me?

497;00:34:14,726;00:34:17,695;Lord Bolton's traveling

497;00:34:14,726;00:34:17,695;tomorrow as well.

498;00:34:17,729;00:34:20,865;He's going to the Twins

498;00:34:17,729;00:34:20,865;for Edmure Tully's wedding.

499;00:34:20,900;00:34:23,301;You're to remain here.

500;00:34:23,335;00:34:25,804;With Locke?

501;00:34:32,379;00:34:34,781;I owe you a debt.

502;00:34:38,619;00:34:40,586;When Catelyn Stark

502;00:34:38,619;00:34:40,586;released you,

503;00:34:40,621;00:34:43,323;we both made a promise to her.

504;00:34:43,357;00:34:45,324;Now it's your promise.

505;00:34:45,359;00:34:48,060;You gave your word.

506;00:34:48,094;00:34:49,661;Keep it

507;00:34:49,696;00:34:52,664;and consider the debt paid.

508;00:34:53,899;00:34:56,734;I will return the Stark

508;00:34:53,899;00:34:56,734;girls to their mother.

509;00:34:58,170;00:35:00,004;I swear it.

510;00:35:05,511;00:35:07,979;Good-bye, Ser Jaime.

511;00:35:27,201;00:35:30,137;Here.

511;00:35:27,201;00:35:30,137;Let me.

512;00:35:37,846;00:35:39,447;It will take time.

513;00:35:45,087;00:35:47,221;Qyburn hopes your father

513;00:35:45,087;00:35:47,221;will force the Citadel

514;00:35:47,255;00:35:48,990;to give him back his chain.

515;00:35:49,024;00:35:50,892;My father will make

515;00:35:49,024;00:35:50,892;him Grand Maester

516;00:35:50,926;00:35:53,394;if he grows me a new hand.

517;00:35:53,429;00:35:57,332;You will give my regards

517;00:35:53,429;00:35:57,332;to Lord Tywin, I trust?

518;00:35:59,034;00:36:02,404;Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I

518;00:35:59,034;00:36:02,404;couldn't make his uncle's wedding.

519;00:36:02,438;00:36:05,607;The Lannisters send

519;00:36:02,438;00:36:05,607;their regards.

520;00:36:10,681;00:36:12,882;Safe journey, Kingslayer.

521;00:36:13,751;00:36:15,185;Nothing to say?

522;00:36:15,219;00:36:17,621;I liked you better before.

523;00:36:17,655;00:36:20,957;I don't remember chopping

523;00:36:17,655;00:36:20,957;your balls off, too.

524;00:36:20,991;00:36:23,893;And don't you worry

524;00:36:20,991;00:36:23,893;about your friend.

525;00:36:23,927;00:36:27,063;We'll take good care of her.

526;00:36:45,648;00:36:47,549;Shh.

527;00:37:11,273;00:37:12,740;Gentle, my lord.

528;00:37:12,774;00:37:14,975;Gentle.

529;00:37:23,518;00:37:26,554;Shh shh shh.

530;00:37:26,588;00:37:29,257;Myranda knows what she's doing.

531;00:37:29,291;00:37:30,959;Let her.

532;00:37:32,061;00:37:34,262;She trained as a septa, only...

533;00:37:35,865;00:37:38,566;she had other urges.

534;00:37:38,601;00:37:42,437;So did the septons,

534;00:37:38,601;00:37:42,437;only they lied about it.

535;00:37:43,806;00:37:45,507;Where is he?

536;00:37:45,541;00:37:47,041;Who, my lord?

537;00:37:47,076;00:37:50,612;There's no one here

537;00:37:47,076;00:37:50,612;but you, me, and Violet.

538;00:37:51,747;00:37:53,214;Please.

539;00:37:53,249;00:37:55,450;Don't you want us to see it?

540;00:37:55,484;00:37:57,519;Oh, come on.

540;00:37:55,484;00:37:57,519;Let us see it.

541;00:37:57,553;00:37:59,788;Everybody talks about it.

542;00:37:59,822;00:38:02,825;He sent you.

543;00:38:02,859;00:38:04,359;Who sent us?

544;00:38:04,394;00:38:06,462;We sent ourselves,

544;00:38:04,394;00:38:06,462;Lord Greyjoy.

545;00:38:06,496;00:38:08,431;We heard so much about it.

546;00:38:10,567;00:38:12,769;Please.

546;00:38:10,567;00:38:12,769;Oh!

547;00:38:12,803;00:38:15,339;There it is.

548;00:38:16,641;00:38:19,076;Oh.

549;00:38:19,110;00:38:21,779;Do you think we're ugly?

550;00:38:21,813;00:38:23,847;He thinks we're ugly.

551;00:38:23,882;00:38:25,783;Well, he's been

551;00:38:23,882;00:38:25,783;through so much.

552;00:38:25,817;00:38:28,219;Look at his poor face.

553;00:38:29,755;00:38:31,222;Help me.

554;00:38:32,557;00:38:34,725;If he comes back...

555;00:38:36,695;00:38:39,564;We need to make him

555;00:38:36,695;00:38:39,564;feel better.

556;00:38:39,598;00:38:42,567;And how can we make

556;00:38:39,598;00:38:42,567;him feel better?

557;00:38:43,436;00:38:45,303;I have an idea.

558;00:39:05,258;00:39:08,460;Oh, she's shy.

559;00:39:08,495;00:39:12,497;You know how they are,

559;00:39:08,495;00:39:12,497;these religious girls.

560;00:39:14,533;00:39:16,701;Maybe he doesn't

560;00:39:14,533;00:39:16,701;know how we are.

561;00:39:28,280;00:39:30,314;Oh.

562;00:39:30,349;00:39:32,283;I felt something.

563;00:39:35,754;00:39:38,423;Oh, Lord Greyjoy.

564;00:39:40,926;00:39:43,395;As good as they say?

564;00:39:40,926;00:39:43,395;Mmm.

565;00:39:53,073;00:39:55,440;And why should you

565;00:39:53,073;00:39:55,440;get all the fun?

566;00:40:05,085;00:40:08,620;What?

566;00:40:05,085;00:40:08,620;You like her better?

567;00:40:12,426;00:40:14,460;Plenty there for both of us.

568;00:40:16,930;00:40:18,664;I was here first.

569;00:40:25,771;00:40:29,106;I'm sorry.

569;00:40:25,771;00:40:29,106;I'm sorry.

570;00:40:29,141;00:40:31,208;Terrible timing.

571;00:40:34,746;00:40:36,913;But I was getting jealous.

572;00:40:41,019;00:40:42,619;Well?

573;00:40:42,654;00:40:46,190;Should we see this cock

573;00:40:42,654;00:40:46,190;everyone's always going on about?

574;00:40:58,103;00:41:01,239;Everyone knows you love girls.

575;00:41:02,208;00:41:05,210;I bet you always thought

575;00:41:02,208;00:41:05,210;they loved you back.

576;00:41:14,455;00:41:17,825;Your famous cock must be

576;00:41:14,455;00:41:17,825;very precious to you.

577;00:41:17,859;00:41:21,829;Would you say it's

577;00:41:17,859;00:41:21,829;your most precious part?

578;00:41:24,933;00:41:28,169;Please.

579;00:41:28,204;00:41:31,138;No.

580;00:41:31,173;00:41:33,241;No!

580;00:41:31,173;00:41:33,241;Mercy, please!

581;00:41:33,275;00:41:35,243;Please, mercy!

581;00:41:33,275;00:41:35,243;Mercy!

582;00:41:35,277;00:41:38,046;This is mercy.

583;00:41:38,080;00:41:40,281;I'm not killing you.

584;00:41:40,316;00:41:44,386;Just making a few alterations.

585;00:41:46,590;00:41:48,991;No! No! No!

586;00:41:49,026;00:41:50,827;Please, no! No!

587;00:41:50,861;00:41:54,230;No! No, please!

587;00:41:50,861;00:41:54,230;Please!

588;00:41:57,033;00:41:58,467;You're gonna scare it off.

589;00:41:58,502;00:42:01,370;I'm not gonna scare it.

589;00:41:58,502;00:42:01,370;I'm gonna kill it.

590;00:42:03,173;00:42:04,773;It's too far away.

591;00:42:27,762;00:42:29,863;Is that a palace?

592;00:42:32,667;00:42:34,334;It's a windmill.

593;00:42:35,203;00:42:37,104;Windmill.

594;00:42:37,138;00:42:40,641;Who built it?

594;00:42:37,138;00:42:40,641;Some king?

595;00:42:40,675;00:42:43,010;Just the men

595;00:42:40,675;00:42:43,010;who used to live here.

596;00:42:43,044;00:42:44,645;They must have

596;00:42:43,044;00:42:44,645;been great builders,

597;00:42:44,679;00:42:46,914;stacking stones so high.

598;00:42:46,948;00:42:50,017;Winterfell has towers

598;00:42:46,948;00:42:50,017;three times that size.

599;00:42:50,051;00:42:52,953;I'm Jon Snow

599;00:42:50,051;00:42:52,953;and I'm from Winterfell.

600;00:42:52,987;00:42:54,154;My daddy was a fancy lord

601;00:42:54,189;00:42:57,124;and I lived in a tower

601;00:42:54,189;00:42:57,124;that touched the clouds.

602;00:42:57,158;00:42:59,127;If you're impressed

602;00:42:57,158;00:42:59,127;by a windmill,

603;00:42:59,161;00:43:02,130;you'd be swooning if you saw

603;00:42:59,161;00:43:02,130;the Great Keep at Winterfell.

604;00:43:02,164;00:43:03,999;What's swooning?

605;00:43:04,033;00:43:05,834;Fainting.

606;00:43:05,869;00:43:08,403;What's fainting?

607;00:43:11,174;00:43:13,275;When a girl sees blood

607;00:43:11,174;00:43:13,275;and collapses.

608;00:43:13,310;00:43:15,478;Why would a girl

608;00:43:13,310;00:43:15,478;see blood and collapse?

609;00:43:15,512;00:43:18,347;Well...

610;00:43:18,382;00:43:20,582;not all girls are like you.

611;00:43:21,751;00:43:23,786;Well, girls see

611;00:43:21,751;00:43:23,786;more blood than boys.

612;00:43:24,988;00:43:27,889;Or do you like girls

612;00:43:24,988;00:43:27,889;who swoon, Jon Snow?

613;00:43:27,924;00:43:29,657;Oh, a spider!

614;00:43:29,692;00:43:32,226;Save me, Jon Snow.

615;00:43:32,261;00:43:34,562;My dress is made

615;00:43:32,261;00:43:34,562;of the purest silk

616;00:43:34,596;00:43:36,964;from Tralalalaleeday.

617;00:43:36,998;00:43:39,566;I'd like to see you

617;00:43:36,998;00:43:39,566;in a silk dress.

618;00:43:41,703;00:43:44,204;Would you?

619;00:43:46,407;00:43:49,210;So I could tear it off you.

620;00:43:49,244;00:43:52,179;Well, you rip

620;00:43:49,244;00:43:52,179;my pretty silk dress,

621;00:43:52,213;00:43:54,348;I'll blacken your eye.

622;00:44:00,989;00:44:04,124;Maybe one day I'll take

622;00:44:00,989;00:44:04,124;you to Winterfell.

623;00:44:05,360;00:44:08,095;Or maybe one day

623;00:44:05,360;00:44:08,095;I'll take you there.

624;00:44:08,129;00:44:10,430;After we've taken

624;00:44:08,129;00:44:10,430;our land back.

625;00:44:13,601;00:44:15,235;Ygritte.

626;00:44:18,306;00:44:20,475;You won't win.

627;00:44:22,011;00:44:24,312;I know your people are brave,

627;00:44:22,011;00:44:24,312;no one denies that.

628;00:44:24,347;00:44:27,549;You know nothing--

628;00:44:24,347;00:44:27,549;Six times in the last thousand years,

629;00:44:27,584;00:44:29,852;a King-beyond-the-Wall

629;00:44:27,584;00:44:29,852;has attacked the kingdoms.

630;00:44:29,886;00:44:33,523;Six times they failed.

630;00:44:29,886;00:44:33,523;And how do you know that?

631;00:44:33,557;00:44:35,458;Every boy in the North

631;00:44:33,557;00:44:35,458;knows it.

632;00:44:35,493;00:44:36,927;We grow up learning it.

633;00:44:36,961;00:44:38,328;Where the battles were fought,

634;00:44:38,362;00:44:40,096;the names of the heroes,

634;00:44:38,362;00:44:40,096;who died where.

635;00:44:40,130;00:44:41,998;Six times you've invaded

636;00:44:42,032;00:44:45,201;and six times you've failed.

637;00:44:45,235;00:44:47,236;The seventh will be the same.

638;00:44:47,270;00:44:50,472;Mance is different.

638;00:44:47,270;00:44:50,472;You don't have the discipline.

639;00:44:50,506;00:44:54,075;You don't have the training.

639;00:44:50,506;00:44:54,075;Your army is no army.

640;00:44:54,110;00:44:55,510;You don't know

640;00:44:54,110;00:44:55,510;how to fight together.

641;00:44:55,544;00:44:58,046;You don't know that.

641;00:44:55,544;00:44:58,046;I do.

642;00:44:58,080;00:44:59,847;I know it.

643;00:44:59,881;00:45:02,216;If you attack the Wall,

643;00:44:59,881;00:45:02,216;you'll die.

644;00:45:02,250;00:45:04,151;All of you.

645;00:45:12,294;00:45:14,428;All of us.

646;00:45:30,312;00:45:32,380;You're mine

647;00:45:32,414;00:45:34,949;as I'm yours.

648;00:45:34,983;00:45:37,518;And if we die, we die.

649;00:45:38,587;00:45:41,022;But first we'll live.

650;00:45:41,056;00:45:45,026;Yes, first we'll live.

651;00:46:01,477;00:46:04,145;What's he going on about?

652;00:46:04,180;00:46:06,548;And how come he always

652;00:46:04,180;00:46:06,548;gets to sit and chat

653;00:46:06,582;00:46:08,650;while we do all the work?

654;00:46:11,587;00:46:13,222;Hodor.

655;00:46:14,858;00:46:18,428;That's where we are.

655;00:46:14,858;00:46:18,428;What are you telling him?

656;00:46:18,462;00:46:20,163;It's all right, Osha.

656;00:46:18,462;00:46:20,163;It's not all right.

657;00:46:20,197;00:46:22,164;You think I can't

657;00:46:20,197;00:46:22,164;hear you every day?

658;00:46:22,199;00:46:23,833;Filling his head

658;00:46:22,199;00:46:23,833;with black magic.

659;00:46:23,867;00:46:26,869;Talking about visions and

659;00:46:23,867;00:46:26,869;three-eyed ravens and worse.

660;00:46:26,904;00:46:29,739;Leave him alone.

660;00:46:26,904;00:46:29,739;He can speak for himself.

661;00:46:29,774;00:46:31,474;I don't fill his head

661;00:46:29,774;00:46:31,474;with anything.

662;00:46:31,508;00:46:34,043;So what do you talk about?

663;00:46:34,078;00:46:37,179;What's happening to him

663;00:46:34,078;00:46:37,179;and what that means.

664;00:46:37,214;00:46:39,781;Go on, then.

664;00:46:37,214;00:46:39,781;Tell us what it means.

665;00:46:39,816;00:46:41,383;It's not like that.

666;00:46:41,417;00:46:43,184;I wish I could

666;00:46:41,417;00:46:43,184;tell him all the answers.

667;00:46:43,219;00:46:45,587;It would be much easier.

668;00:46:45,621;00:46:48,389;I don't want you

668;00:46:45,621;00:46:48,389;talking to him anymore.

669;00:46:48,424;00:46:49,891;Until we get to your brother

669;00:46:48,424;00:46:49,891;at Castle Black.

670;00:46:49,925;00:46:52,860;We're not going to Castle Black.

670;00:46:49,925;00:46:52,860;What did you say?

671;00:46:52,894;00:46:56,396;I told you already.

671;00:46:52,894;00:46:56,396;Jon Snow isn't there.

672;00:46:56,431;00:46:58,131;Bran needs to find

672;00:46:56,431;00:46:58,131;the raven beyond the Wall.

673;00:46:58,166;00:46:59,800;Oh, no.

673;00:46:58,166;00:46:59,800;I'm not going back there.

674;00:46:59,834;00:47:02,903;Your brother is at Castle Black.

674;00:46:59,834;00:47:02,903;That's where we're going.

675;00:47:04,639;00:47:06,440;Look at me.

676;00:47:07,775;00:47:09,743;The raven's been coming to me

677;00:47:09,778;00:47:12,146;ever since I fell

677;00:47:09,778;00:47:12,146;from that tower.

678;00:47:12,180;00:47:14,949;He wants me to find him.

679;00:47:14,983;00:47:18,352;I don't have my legs anymore.

680;00:47:18,387;00:47:20,288;This is what I have now.

681;00:47:20,322;00:47:22,490;You have a family.

682;00:47:22,524;00:47:24,358;You need to go back

682;00:47:22,524;00:47:24,358;to Castle Black

683;00:47:24,393;00:47:27,161;so you can get back to

683;00:47:24,393;00:47:27,161;them where you belong.

684;00:47:27,196;00:47:30,165;What if I belong in the North?

685;00:47:30,199;00:47:34,502;What if I fell from

685;00:47:30,199;00:47:34,502;that tower for a reason?

686;00:47:34,536;00:47:36,738;Is that what he's telling you?

687;00:47:36,772;00:47:38,940;That it's all for a reason?

688;00:47:38,974;00:47:43,178;All these bad things happened because

688;00:47:38,974;00:47:43,178;the gods got big plans for you?

689;00:47:43,212;00:47:45,180;I wish it were true,

689;00:47:43,212;00:47:45,180;little lord.

690;00:47:45,215;00:47:49,385;But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's

690;00:47:45,215;00:47:49,385;cold shit for you or me or anyone.

691;00:47:49,419;00:47:51,687;You don't understand.

691;00:47:49,419;00:47:51,687;You don't know.

692;00:47:51,722;00:47:53,689;You don't know.

692;00:47:51,722;00:47:53,689;None of you know.

693;00:47:53,723;00:47:55,958;None of you have been up there.

694;00:47:59,062;00:48:01,396;I had a man once.

695;00:48:01,430;00:48:03,165;A good man.

696;00:48:03,199;00:48:04,967;Bruni, his name was.

697;00:48:05,002;00:48:08,004;I was his and he was mine.

698;00:48:08,038;00:48:11,006;But one night Bruni disappears.

699;00:48:11,041;00:48:13,642;People said he left me,

700;00:48:13,676;00:48:15,010;but I knew him.

701;00:48:15,044;00:48:18,980;He'd never leave me.

701;00:48:15,044;00:48:18,980;Not for long.

702;00:48:19,014;00:48:21,383;I knew he'd come back.

703;00:48:23,052;00:48:25,153;And he did.

704;00:48:26,389;00:48:29,558;He came in through

704;00:48:26,389;00:48:29,558;the back of the hut.

705;00:48:30,427;00:48:32,395;Only it wasn't Bruni.

706;00:48:32,429;00:48:34,997;Not really.

707;00:48:35,032;00:48:38,568;His skin was pale

708;00:48:38,602;00:48:41,971;like a dead man's.

709;00:48:42,006;00:48:44,841;His eyes bluer than clear sky.

710;00:48:48,580;00:48:50,348;He came at me,

711;00:48:50,382;00:48:52,350;grabbed me by the neck

712;00:48:52,384;00:48:55,220;and squeezed so hard

713;00:48:55,254;00:48:58,090;I could feel the life

713;00:48:55,254;00:48:58,090;slipping out of me.

714;00:49:00,393;00:49:02,828;I don't know

714;00:49:00,393;00:49:02,828;how I got the knife.

715;00:49:02,862;00:49:05,765;When I did, I stuck it

716;00:49:05,799;00:49:08,501;deep into his heart.

717;00:49:11,672;00:49:14,440;And he hardly seemed to notice.

718;00:49:15,843;00:49:20,146;I had to burn our hut down

718;00:49:15,843;00:49:20,146;with him inside.

719;00:49:22,549;00:49:25,284;I didn't ask the gods

719;00:49:22,549;00:49:25,284;what it meant.

720;00:49:25,318;00:49:29,054;I didn't need to.

720;00:49:25,318;00:49:29,054;I already knew.

721;00:49:29,089;00:49:32,257;It meant the North

721;00:49:29,089;00:49:32,257;was no place for men to be.

722;00:49:32,292;00:49:34,560;Not anymore.

723;00:49:36,897;00:49:39,132;I promised your maester

723;00:49:36,897;00:49:39,132;I'd get you to Castle Black

724;00:49:39,166;00:49:41,734;and no further.

725;00:49:50,043;00:49:51,877;How is the

725;00:49:50,043;00:49:51,877;pain, my lord?

726;00:49:54,880;00:49:57,982;What's the purpose

726;00:49:54,880;00:49:57,982;of an arm with no hand?

727;00:50:01,686;00:50:04,521;Well, we've stymied

727;00:50:01,686;00:50:04,521;the corruption.

728;00:50:04,556;00:50:07,358;Yes, we've stymied

728;00:50:04,556;00:50:07,358;the corruption.

729;00:50:07,392;00:50:09,460;You're a learned man.

730;00:50:09,494;00:50:11,095;All the good it's done me.

731;00:50:11,129;00:50:13,297;You did well

731;00:50:11,129;00:50:13,297;sewing up this mess.

732;00:50:13,331;00:50:15,666;You're far better

732;00:50:13,331;00:50:15,666;at this sort of work

733;00:50:15,701;00:50:18,369;than Grand Maester Pycelle.

734;00:50:18,404;00:50:21,005;Faint praise, my lord.

735;00:50:22,441;00:50:25,844;So why did the Citadel

735;00:50:22,441;00:50:25,844;take your chain?

736;00:50:25,878;00:50:27,845;Did you fondle

736;00:50:25,878;00:50:27,845;one boy too many?

737;00:50:27,880;00:50:31,149;No, my lord.

737;00:50:27,880;00:50:31,149;That's not my weakness.

738;00:50:32,618;00:50:34,919;What is?

739;00:50:37,189;00:50:38,723;Curiosity.

740;00:50:38,757;00:50:42,727;The only way to treat disease

740;00:50:38,757;00:50:42,727;is to understand disease.

741;00:50:42,761;00:50:45,029;And the only way

741;00:50:42,761;00:50:45,029;to understand it

742;00:50:45,064;00:50:47,432;is to study the afflicted.

743;00:50:47,466;00:50:50,135;You performed experiments

743;00:50:47,466;00:50:50,135;on living men.

744;00:50:50,170;00:50:52,037;On dying men.

744;00:50:50,170;00:50:52,037;With their permission?

745;00:50:52,072;00:50:55,108;My studies

745;00:50:52,072;00:50:55,108;have given me insight

746;00:50:55,142;00:50:56,810;that has saved many lives.

747;00:50:56,844;00:50:59,212;Dying paupers, I assume.

748;00:50:59,246;00:51:02,815;Men with no families

748;00:50:59,246;00:51:02,815;to complain.

749;00:51:02,850;00:51:04,651;You found them moaning

749;00:51:02,850;00:51:04,651;in the poorhouse

750;00:51:04,685;00:51:07,120;and had them carted

750;00:51:04,685;00:51:07,120;back to your garret

751;00:51:07,154;00:51:10,423;and opened up their bellies

751;00:51:07,154;00:51:10,423;to see what was inside.

752;00:51:10,458;00:51:12,892;How many men have

752;00:51:10,458;00:51:12,892;you killed, my lord?

753;00:51:12,927;00:51:14,561;I don't know.

754;00:51:14,595;00:51:17,731;50? 100?

755;00:51:19,501;00:51:21,569;Countless.

756;00:51:21,603;00:51:23,605;Countless has

756;00:51:21,603;00:51:23,605;a nice ring to it.

757;00:51:23,639;00:51:25,941;And how many lives

757;00:51:23,639;00:51:25,941;have you saved?

758;00:51:25,975;00:51:28,810;Half a million.

759;00:51:29,912;00:51:32,247;The population

759;00:51:29,912;00:51:32,247;of King's Landing.

760;00:51:37,354;00:51:40,856;You were in charge

760;00:51:37,354;00:51:40,856;of the ravens at Harrenhal.

761;00:51:40,890;00:51:45,093;Did you-- did you get a bird off

761;00:51:40,890;00:51:45,093;to Brienne's father in Tarth?

762;00:51:45,128;00:51:47,729;A bird flew off

762;00:51:45,128;00:51:47,729;and a bird flew back.

763;00:51:48,964;00:51:51,332;Lord Selwyn Tarth

764;00:51:51,367;00:51:55,069;offered 300 gold dragons for

764;00:51:51,367;00:51:55,069;his daughter's safe return.

765;00:51:55,104;00:51:58,940;A fair offer.

765;00:51:55,104;00:51:58,940;A fair offer. Locke won't take it.

766;00:52:00,610;00:52:02,511;Why not?

767;00:52:02,545;00:52:03,912;He's convinced Lord Tarth

768;00:52:03,947;00:52:06,648;owns all the sapphire

768;00:52:03,947;00:52:06,648;mines in Westeros.

769;00:52:08,084;00:52:10,386;He feels he's being cheated.

770;00:52:10,420;00:52:12,589;They'd be fools to kill her.

771;00:52:12,623;00:52:15,058;These men have been

771;00:52:12,623;00:52:15,058;at war a long time.

772;00:52:15,093;00:52:17,260;Most of them

772;00:52:15,093;00:52:17,260;will be dead by winter.

773;00:52:17,295;00:52:20,230;She'll be their

773;00:52:17,295;00:52:20,230;entertainment tonight.

774;00:52:20,264;00:52:22,499;Beyond tonight,

775;00:52:22,533;00:52:24,801;I don't think

775;00:52:22,533;00:52:24,801;they care very much.

776;00:52:43,954;00:52:46,356;We have to return to Harrenhal.

777;00:52:46,390;00:52:47,823;Why?

778;00:52:47,858;00:52:49,325;I've left something behind.

779;00:52:49,359;00:52:50,960;Absolutely not.

780;00:52:50,994;00:52:52,962;I've got orders

780;00:52:50,994;00:52:52,962;from Lord Bolton.

781;00:52:52,996;00:52:54,530;And what are those orders?

782;00:52:54,564;00:52:58,067;To deliver you to your

782;00:52:54,564;00:52:58,067;father at King's Landing.

783;00:52:58,101;00:53:00,336;You think you'll get a reward.

784;00:53:02,372;00:53:05,140;I serve Lord Bolton.

785;00:53:05,174;00:53:06,708;Any appreciation

785;00:53:05,174;00:53:06,708;your father--

786;00:53:06,742;00:53:08,076;You think

786;00:53:06,742;00:53:08,076;you're getting a reward.

787;00:53:08,110;00:53:09,410;Let me explain

787;00:53:08,110;00:53:09,410;something to you.

788;00:53:09,444;00:53:11,445;When my father sees me,

788;00:53:09,444;00:53:11,445;the first thing

789;00:53:11,479;00:53:13,847;he's going to ask

789;00:53:11,479;00:53:13,847;is what happened to my hand.

790;00:53:13,881;00:53:17,117;And I'm going to tell him

790;00:53:13,881;00:53:17,117;this man chopped it off.

791;00:53:17,151;00:53:20,987;I had nothing--

791;00:53:17,151;00:53:20,987;Or I could tell him this man saved my life.

792;00:53:22,890;00:53:25,259;We return to Harrenhal now.

793;00:53:44,579;00:53:46,813;Whoa.

794;00:53:48,316;00:53:50,718;Eyes open, lads.

794;00:53:48,316;00:53:50,718;Be quiet.

809;00:54:41,438;00:54:43,039;Just get her out of there.

811;00:54:45,475;00:54:48,377;still think that the only

811;00:54:45,475;00:54:48,377;thing that matters is gold.

813;00:54:51,848;00:54:54,917;than all her sapphires.

814;00:54:54,951;00:54:57,353;So go buy yourself

814;00:54:54,951;00:54:57,353;a golden hand

815;00:54:57,387;00:55:00,022;and fuck yourself with it.

816;00:55:10,433;00:55:12,568;Ah!

817;00:55:18,908;00:55:20,442;Get behind me.

817;00:55:18,908;00:55:20,442;I will not.

818;00:55:31,353;00:55:33,788;What the fuck are you

818;00:55:31,353;00:55:33,788;doing to my bear?

819;00:55:33,822;00:55:35,723;Lord Bolton charged me

819;00:55:33,822;00:55:35,723;with bringing him back

820;00:55:35,757;00:55:38,792;and that's what I aim to do.

821;00:55:42,296;00:55:44,230;Pull her up.

822;00:55:57,510;00:55:59,344;Hold my legs.

823;00:56:22,033;00:56:23,801;Pull him up!

824;00:56:34,079;00:56:36,214;The bitch stays.

825;00:56:38,750;00:56:40,718;We're taking her

825;00:56:38,750;00:56:40,718;to King's Landing.

826;00:56:40,752;00:56:42,386;Unless you kill me.

827;00:56:44,890;00:56:46,624;She belongs to me.

828;00:56:46,658;00:56:49,560;Lord Bolton's orders.

829;00:56:49,594;00:56:52,363;What do you think is more

829;00:56:49,594;00:56:52,363;important to Lord Bolton?

830;00:56:52,397;00:56:54,098;Getting his pet rat a reward

831;00:56:54,132;00:56:57,468;or ensuring Tywin Lannister

831;00:56:54,132;00:56:57,468;gets his son back alive?

832;00:57:17,791;00:57:20,760;Well, we must be on our way.

833;00:57:24,298;00:57:26,466;Sorry about the sapphires.
