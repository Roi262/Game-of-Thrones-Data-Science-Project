13;00:05:05,850;00:05:07,811;You'll be fine.

18;00:05:32,580;00:05:34,235;Good. Good.
19;00:05:34,294;00:05:37,059;I'm sure you've had quite a fright.
19;00:05:34,294;00:05:37,059;Rest easy.
20;00:05:37,155;00:05:39,050;The worst is past.

31;00:06:05,515;00:06:08,086;1,000 gold cloaks
31;00:06:05,515;00:06:08,086;are searching for you.
32;00:06:08,176;00:06:09,991;And if they found you,
33;00:06:10,055;00:06:13,624;how do you think they would punish
33;00:06:10,055;00:06:13,624;the girl who murdered the king?
34;00:06:13,748;00:06:17,011;I didn't murder anyone.
34;00:06:13,748;00:06:17,011;I know. I know.
35;00:06:17,125;00:06:18,325;But you must admit
35;00:06:17,125;00:06:18,325;it looks suspicious.
36;00:06:18,372;00:06:20,413;The king who
36;00:06:18,372;00:06:20,413;executed your father,
37;00:06:20,484;00:06:22,654;who tormented you for years,
38;00:06:22,730;00:06:25,383;and you fled the scene
38;00:06:22,730;00:06:25,383;of his murder.
39;00:06:25,476;00:06:27,611;Why did you kill him?
40;00:06:27,686;00:06:30,371;Because he was
40;00:06:27,686;00:06:30,371;a drunk and a fool
41;00:06:30,465;00:06:33,229;and I don't trust drunk fools.
42;00:06:33,325;00:06:35,510;He saved me.
43;00:06:35,587;00:06:38,480;Saved you? My lady,
43;00:06:35,587;00:06:38,480;he followed my orders.
44;00:06:38,581;00:06:42,794;Every one of them.
44;00:06:38,581;00:06:42,794;And he did it all for gold.
45;00:06:42,941;00:06:45,559;Money buys a man's
45;00:06:42,941;00:06:45,559;silence for a time.
46;00:06:45,650;00:06:48,986;A bolt in the heart
46;00:06:45,650;00:06:48,986;buys it forever.
47;00:06:51,555;00:06:54,078;He was helping me
47;00:06:51,555;00:06:54,078;because I saved his life.
48;00:06:54,167;00:06:58,154;Yes, and he gave you
48;00:06:54,167;00:06:58,154;a priceless necklace
49;00:06:58,293;00:07:01,298;that once belonged
49;00:06:58,293;00:07:01,298;to his grandmother.

50;00:07:01,403;00:07:04,455;of House Hollard.
51;00:07:12,546;00:07:15,215;I had it made a few weeks ago.
52;00:07:16,505;00:07:19,398;What did I once tell
52;00:07:16,505;00:07:19,398;you about the capital?
53;00:07:19,499;00:07:22,167;We're all liars here.
54;00:07:23,991;00:07:25,838;Come, my lady.
55;00:07:25,903;00:07:28,474;I know you've had
55;00:07:25,903;00:07:28,474;a difficult day.
56;00:07:28,564;00:07:30,606;But you're safe now.
57;00:07:30,678;00:07:32,767;I promise you that.
58;00:07:32,840;00:07:34,977;You're safe with me
59;00:07:35,052;00:07:37,670;and sailing home.
60;00:07:43,785;00:07:46,308;So am I the queen?
61;00:07:46,396;00:07:48,131;More than you were with Renly.
62;00:07:48,192;00:07:51,198;Less than you would have been if
62;00:07:48,192;00:07:51,198;Joffrey had done you the courtesy
63;00:07:51,303;00:07:54,163;of consummating
63;00:07:51,303;00:07:54,163;the marriage before dying.
64;00:07:54,263;00:07:57,397;In any case, this would
64;00:07:54,263;00:07:57,397;not be an opportune moment
65;00:07:57,506;00:07:59,354;to press the issue.
66;00:07:59,419;00:08:01,219;Clawing at his own throat,
67;00:08:01,282;00:08:04,063;looking to his mother to make
67;00:08:01,282;00:08:04,063;it stop-- it was horrible.
68;00:08:04,161;00:08:06,603;The world is overflowing
68;00:08:04,161;00:08:06,603;with horrible things.
69;00:08:06,688;00:08:09,048;But they're all a tray
69;00:08:06,688;00:08:09,048;of cakes next to death.
70;00:08:10,597;00:08:13,619;They brought me your grandfather's
70;00:08:10,597;00:08:13,619;body when he died, you know?
71;00:08:13,724;00:08:15,492;Made me look at it.
72;00:08:15,554;00:08:17,033;What was it like?
73;00:08:17,086;00:08:20,187;They took me to the Great
73;00:08:17,086;00:08:20,187;Hall and there he was.
74;00:08:20,295;00:08:22,094;The man I'd married
75;00:08:22,157;00:08:25,292;and suffered to father
75;00:08:22,157;00:08:25,292;my children.
76;00:08:25,401;00:08:27,618;A great doughy lump
76;00:08:25,401;00:08:27,618;I'd sat next to
77;00:08:27,696;00:08:30,991;at endless dinners
77;00:08:27,696;00:08:30,991;and tedious gatherings.
78;00:08:31,106;00:08:33,691;There he was...
79;00:08:34,683;00:08:37,101;lying on a table.
80;00:08:40,338;00:08:42,459;One of my husbands
80;00:08:40,338;00:08:42,459;preferred the company of men
81;00:08:42,533;00:08:44,141;and was stabbed
81;00:08:42,533;00:08:44,141;through the heart.
82;00:08:44,198;00:08:46,528;Another was happiest
82;00:08:44,198;00:08:46,528;torturing animals
83;00:08:46,609;00:08:48,779;and was poisoned
83;00:08:46,609;00:08:48,779;at our wedding feast.
84;00:08:48,855;00:08:50,783;I must be cursed.
84;00:08:48,855;00:08:50,783;Nonsense.
85;00:08:50,851;00:08:53,769;Your circumstances
85;00:08:50,851;00:08:53,769;have improved markedly.
86;00:08:55,507;00:08:58,319;You may not have enjoyed
86;00:08:55,507;00:08:58,319;watching him die,
87;00:08:58,418;00:09:00,234;but you enjoyed it more
87;00:08:58,418;00:09:00,234;than you would have enjoyed
88;00:09:00,298;00:09:02,226;being married to him,
88;00:09:00,298;00:09:02,226;I can promise you that.
89;00:09:02,293;00:09:04,334;But I would have been the queen.
90;00:09:04,406;00:09:06,254;Our alliance with the Lannisters
91;00:09:06,319;00:09:08,858;remains every bit
91;00:09:06,319;00:09:08,858;as necessary to them
92;00:09:08,947;00:09:11,358;as it is unpleasant for us.
93;00:09:11,442;00:09:14,335;You did wonderful
93;00:09:11,442;00:09:14,335;work on Joffrey.
94;00:09:14,436;00:09:17,471;The next one should be easier.
95;00:09:27,161;00:09:29,078;Tywin:
95;00:09:27,161;00:09:29,078;Your brother is dead.
96;00:09:30,570;00:09:33,438;Do you know what that means?
97;00:09:35,677;00:09:39,062;I'm not trying to trick you.
98;00:09:40,251;00:09:42,179;It means I'll become king.
99;00:09:42,246;00:09:44,577;Yes, you will become king.
100;00:09:44,659;00:09:47,911;What kind of king
100;00:09:44,659;00:09:47,911;do you think you'll be?
101;00:09:48,983;00:09:50,670;A good king?
102;00:09:50,730;00:09:53,065;Mm, I think so as well.
103;00:09:54,605;00:09:57,531;You've got the right
103;00:09:54,605;00:09:57,531;temperament for it.
104;00:09:57,633;00:10:01,330;But what makes
104;00:09:57,633;00:10:01,330;a good king? Hmm?
105;00:10:01,459;00:10:04,754;What is a good king's single
105;00:10:01,459;00:10:04,754;most important quality?
106;00:10:04,869;00:10:07,006;This is hardly
106;00:10:04,869;00:10:07,006;the place or the time.
107;00:10:07,081;00:10:08,962;Holiness?
108;00:10:09,028;00:10:11,163;Hmm.
109;00:10:11,238;00:10:14,453;Baelor the Blessed was holy.
110;00:10:14,565;00:10:16,734;And pious.
111;00:10:16,810;00:10:19,334;He built this sept.
112;00:10:19,423;00:10:22,637;He also named a six-year-old
112;00:10:19,423;00:10:22,637;boy high septon
113;00:10:22,749;00:10:26,052;because he thought the boy
113;00:10:22,749;00:10:26,052;could work miracles.
114;00:10:27,406;00:10:30,058;He ended up fasting
114;00:10:27,406;00:10:30,058;himself into an early grave
115;00:10:30,151;00:10:32,208;because food was of this world
116;00:10:32,280;00:10:34,481;and this world was sinful.
117;00:10:36,887;00:10:38,414;Justice.
118;00:10:38,468;00:10:40,155;Yeah.
119;00:10:40,214;00:10:42,515;A good king must be just.
120;00:10:43,458;00:10:45,376;Orys I was just.
121;00:10:46,709;00:10:48,838;Everyone applauded his reforms.
122;00:10:48,913;00:10:50,874;Nobles and commoners alike.
123;00:10:50,943;00:10:53,032;But he wasn't just for long.
124;00:10:53,105;00:10:55,081;He was murdered in his sleep
125;00:10:55,150;00:10:57,352;after less than a year
125;00:10:55,150;00:10:57,352;by his own brother.
126;00:10:57,430;00:11:00,564;Was that truly just of him?
127;00:11:00,673;00:11:02,844;To abandon his subjects
127;00:11:00,673;00:11:02,844;to an evil
128;00:11:02,920;00:11:05,056;that he was too gullible
128;00:11:02,920;00:11:05,056;to recognize?
129;00:11:05,131;00:11:07,466;No.
129;00:11:05,131;00:11:07,466;No.
130;00:11:09,822;00:11:12,635;What about strength?
130;00:11:09,822;00:11:12,635;Yes.
131;00:11:12,733;00:11:14,983;Strength.
132;00:11:15,062;00:11:17,198;King Robert was strong.
133;00:11:17,273;00:11:19,716;He won the rebellion
134;00:11:19,801;00:11:23,305;and crushed
134;00:11:19,801;00:11:23,305;the Targaryen dynasty.
135;00:11:23,427;00:11:26,240;And he attended three
135;00:11:23,427;00:11:26,240;small council meetings
136;00:11:26,339;00:11:28,138;in 17 years.
137;00:11:28,201;00:11:32,543;He spent his time whoring
137;00:11:28,201;00:11:32,543;and hunting and drinking
138;00:11:32,694;00:11:35,194;until the last two killed him.
139;00:11:36,601;00:11:39,576;So, we have a man who
139;00:11:36,601;00:11:39,576;starves himself to death,
140;00:11:39,679;00:11:43,101;a man who lets his own
140;00:11:39,679;00:11:43,101;brother murder him,
141;00:11:43,221;00:11:46,841;and a man who thinks that winning
141;00:11:43,221;00:11:46,841;and ruling are the same thing.

278;00:20:23,905;00:20:26,026;don't mean much anymore.

282;00:20:34,333;00:20:37,548;Tully ruled the Riverlands.
283;00:20:37,661;00:20:40,361;We had good years and bad

284;00:20:40,455;00:20:43,219;But we were safe.

285;00:20:43,316;00:20:47,255;our food, steal our silver.
286;00:20:47,392;00:20:49,368;I was gonna send Sally north

289;00:20:55,458;00:20:57,626;Afraid not.
290;00:21:00,914;00:21:03,266;How can a man
290;00:21:00,914;00:21:03,266;not keep ale in his home?

295;00:21:17,131;00:21:19,782;I could use a man to help
295;00:21:17,131;00:21:19,782;with the farmwork.

299;00:21:26,729;00:21:29,864;they'd run the other way.
300;00:21:31,353;00:21:33,187;Meaning no offense.

302;00:21:41,333;00:21:43,293;I don't have much.
303;00:21:43,362;00:21:46,998;But I have hidden a bit of

312;00:22:34,260;00:22:37,234;You told me you weren't a thief.
312;00:22:34,260;00:22:37,234;I wasn't.
313;00:22:37,338;00:22:39,989;He took us in.
313;00:22:37,338;00:22:39,989;He fed us and you--
314;00:22:40,081;00:22:41,817;Aye, he took us in.
314;00:22:40,081;00:22:41,817;He's a good man

316;00:22:43,493;00:22:45,227;And they'll both

333;00:23:31,196;00:23:33,614;Maybe I'll give her a copper

334;00:23:39,048;00:23:40,655;They all think I'm lying.
335;00:23:40,711;00:23:42,366;About what?
336;00:23:42,425;00:23:44,627;Killing the white walker.
337;00:23:44,704;00:23:47,564;You're not lying.

339;00:23:51,407;00:23:53,576;But you're the only one
339;00:23:51,407;00:23:53,576;that saw it.

342;00:23:56,596;00:23:59,648;Well, a wildling.
343;00:24:00,588;00:24:02,517;My father hated that word.
344;00:24:02,584;00:24:05,878;It's not a very nice word,
344;00:24:02,584;00:24:05,878;I suppose.

346;00:24:07,823;00:24:11,876;It makes me sound a bit
346;00:24:07,823;00:24:11,876;dangerous, doesn't it?
347;00:24:23,708;00:24:25,315;So...
348;00:24:25,372;00:24:27,059;are you all right?
349;00:24:27,118;00:24:29,609;No one bothering you?
350;00:24:29,696;00:24:31,271;I get a lot of looks.

352;00:24:33,439;00:24:36,332;if that's what you mean.
353;00:24:36,433;00:24:39,567;I worry about it sometimes.
354;00:24:39,677;00:24:41,894;All the time.

367;00:25:26,849;00:25:29,184;For worrying about me.

434;00:29:22,212;00:29:25,425;I like this one. It's full
434;00:29:22,212;00:29:25,425;of sword fights and pirates.
435;00:29:25,537;00:29:27,193;You were a pirate once.
436;00:29:27,251;00:29:29,098;No, I was never a pirate.
436;00:29:27,251;00:29:29,098;I was a smuggler.
437;00:29:29,163;00:29:30,321;What's the difference?
438;00:29:30,362;00:29:32,290;Well, if you're
438;00:29:30,362;00:29:32,290;a famous smuggler,
439;00:29:32,358;00:29:33,965;you're not doing it right.
440;00:29:34,022;00:29:35,789;My father says
440;00:29:34,022;00:29:35,789;a criminal is a criminal.
441;00:29:35,851;00:29:37,505;Your father lacks

442;00:29:37,563;00:29:39,765;of bad behavior.
443;00:29:39,842;00:29:41,933;So do the Braavosi.
444;00:29:42,006;00:29:43,659;You've sailed to Braavos?
444;00:29:42,006;00:29:43,659;Of course.
445;00:29:43,718;00:29:46,450;Almost got beheaded
445;00:29:43,718;00:29:46,450;by a First Sword of Braavos.
446;00:29:46,545;00:29:50,725;I tried to explain to him the difference

447;00:29:50,871;00:29:54,568;but he didn't seem any more interested
447;00:29:50,871;00:29:54,568;in the distinction than your father.
448;00:29:54,696;00:29:56,383;I suppose if you work
448;00:29:54,696;00:29:56,383;for the Iron Bank of Braavos
449;00:29:56,443;00:29:58,853;and each one of your gold

450;00:29:58,937;00:30:02,890;you tend not to be overly concerned
450;00:29:58,937;00:30:02,890;with the kind of distinction--
451;00:30:21,176;00:30:23,587;What was that for?
451;00:30:21,176;00:30:23,587;I need you to write a message.
452;00:30:23,672;00:30:25,760;You should write it yourself.

454;00:30:27,414;00:30:30,516;to do it. Go on.

545;00:36:15,384;00:36:17,935;inside the eye
545;00:36:15,384;00:36:17,935;of a blue-eyed giant.
546;00:36:19,841;00:36:22,091;The king was poisoned.
547;00:36:22,170;00:36:25,160;I hear you studied
547;00:36:22,170;00:36:25,160;poisons at the Citadel.
548;00:36:25,265;00:36:27,579;I did.
548;00:36:25,265;00:36:27,579;This is why I know.
549;00:36:27,660;00:36:31,034;Your hatred for my family
549;00:36:27,660;00:36:31,034;is rather well known.
550;00:36:31,151;00:36:34,077;You arrive at the capital,
550;00:36:31,151;00:36:34,077;an expert in poisoning,
551;00:36:34,179;00:36:37,844;some days later my grandson
551;00:36:34,179;00:36:37,844;dies of poisoning.
552;00:36:37,972;00:36:39,289;Rather suspicious.
553;00:36:39,336;00:36:41,184;Why haven't you thrown
553;00:36:39,336;00:36:41,184;me in a dungeon?
554;00:36:41,249;00:36:43,660;You spoke with Tyrion
554;00:36:41,249;00:36:43,660;in this very brothel
555;00:36:43,744;00:36:45,945;on the day that you arrived.
556;00:36:46,022;00:36:47,276;What did you discuss?
557;00:36:47,321;00:36:49,297;You think we conspired together?
558;00:36:49,366;00:36:50,732;What did you discuss?
559;00:36:50,780;00:36:54,027;The death of my sister.
560;00:36:54,141;00:36:55,748;For which you blame me.
561;00:36:55,804;00:36:57,940;She was raped and murdered
561;00:36:55,804;00:36:57,940;by the Mountain.
562;00:36:58,015;00:37:00,780;The Mountain follows
562;00:36:58,015;00:37:00,780;your orders.
563;00:37:00,877;00:37:02,451;Of course I blame you.
564;00:37:02,506;00:37:04,869;Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.
565;00:37:04,952;00:37:06,558;Should I be concerned?
566;00:37:06,614;00:37:10,118;You are unarmed and unguarded because
566;00:37:06,614;00:37:10,118;you know me better than that.
567;00:37:10,241;00:37:12,685;I am a man of reason.
568;00:37:12,770;00:37:14,698;If I cut your throat today,
569;00:37:14,766;00:37:16,432;I will be drawn
569;00:37:14,766;00:37:16,432;and quartered tomorrow.
570;00:37:16,511;00:37:18,488;Men at war commit
570;00:37:16,511;00:37:18,488;all kinds of crimes
571;00:37:18,557;00:37:20,324;without their
571;00:37:18,557;00:37:20,324;superiors' knowledge.
572;00:37:20,387;00:37:22,830;So you deny involvement
572;00:37:20,387;00:37:22,830;in Elia's murder?
573;00:37:22,915;00:37:25,633;Categorically.
574;00:37:34,808;00:37:37,138;I would like to speak
574;00:37:34,808;00:37:37,138;with the Mountain.
575;00:37:37,220;00:37:39,936;I'm sure he would enjoy
575;00:37:37,220;00:37:39,936;speaking with you.
576;00:37:40,031;00:37:43,111;He might not enjoy it as
576;00:37:40,031;00:37:43,111;much as he thinks he would.
577;00:37:44,289;00:37:47,391;I could arrange
577;00:37:44,289;00:37:47,391;for this meeting.
578;00:37:47,500;00:37:51,148;But you want
578;00:37:47,500;00:37:51,148;something in return.
579;00:37:51,275;00:37:53,767;There will be a trial
579;00:37:51,275;00:37:53,767;for my son.
580;00:37:53,854;00:37:55,910;And as custom dictates,
581;00:37:55,982;00:37:58,795;three judges
581;00:37:55,982;00:37:58,795;will render a verdict.
582;00:37:58,893;00:38:00,290;I will preside.
583;00:38:00,340;00:38:03,395;Mace Tyrell will serve
583;00:38:00,340;00:38:03,395;as the second judge.
584;00:38:03,501;00:38:05,751;I would like you
584;00:38:03,501;00:38:05,751;to be the third.
585;00:38:05,830;00:38:07,678;Why?
586;00:38:07,743;00:38:11,166;Not long ago, the Tyrells
586;00:38:07,743;00:38:11,166;sided with Renly Baratheon.
587;00:38:11,285;00:38:14,129;Declared themselves
587;00:38:11,285;00:38:14,129;enemies of the throne.
588;00:38:14,229;00:38:16,302;Now they are
588;00:38:14,229;00:38:16,302;our strongest allies.
589;00:38:16,374;00:38:18,528;Well, you made
589;00:38:16,374;00:38:18,528;the Tyrell girl a queen.
590;00:38:18,604;00:38:22,220;Asking me to judge at your son's
590;00:38:18,604;00:38:22,220;trial isn't quite as tempting.
591;00:38:22,346;00:38:26,123;I will also invite you
591;00:38:22,346;00:38:26,123;to sit on the small council
592;00:38:26,255;00:38:29,841;to serve as one of the new
592;00:38:26,255;00:38:29,841;king's principal advisors.
593;00:38:35,570;00:38:40,102;I never realized you had such
593;00:38:35,570;00:38:40,102;respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.
594;00:38:40,260;00:38:43,764;We are not the Seven Kingdoms
594;00:38:40,260;00:38:43,764;until Dorne returns to the fold.
595;00:38:43,886;00:38:47,536;The king is dead. The Greyjoys
595;00:38:43,886;00:38:47,536;are in open rebellion.
596;00:38:47,663;00:38:50,798;A wildling army
596;00:38:47,663;00:38:50,798;marches on the Wall.
597;00:38:50,907;00:38:55,376;And in the East, a Targaryen
597;00:38:50,907;00:38:55,376;girl has three dragons.
598;00:38:57,392;00:39:00,366;Before long, she will
598;00:38:57,392;00:39:00,366;turn her eyes to Westeros.
599;00:39:00,470;00:39:03,282;Only the Dornish
599;00:39:00,470;00:39:03,282;managed to resist
600;00:39:03,380;00:39:06,113;Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.
601;00:39:06,209;00:39:09,094;You're saying you need us?
602;00:39:10,700;00:39:13,158;That must be hard
602;00:39:10,700;00:39:13,158;for you to admit.
603;00:39:13,244;00:39:16,090;We need each other.
604;00:39:16,189;00:39:19,804;You help me serve justice
604;00:39:16,189;00:39:19,804;to the king's assassins
605;00:39:19,930;00:39:22,899;and I will help you
605;00:39:19,930;00:39:22,899;serve justice to Elia's.
606;00:39:34,702;00:39:37,370;( door unlocks )
607;00:39:41,555;00:39:43,556;Podrick.
608;00:39:44,965;00:39:46,410;Apologies for the stench.
609;00:39:46,461;00:39:48,840;I brought you some wine, my
609;00:39:46,461;00:39:48,840;lord, but they took it from me.
610;00:39:48,923;00:39:50,642;A noble effort.
611;00:39:50,702;00:39:52,952;They didn't find
611;00:39:50,702;00:39:52,952;the candles, though.
612;00:39:53,031;00:39:55,248;A quill, some parchment,
613;00:39:55,326;00:39:58,058;duck sausage, almonds,
614;00:39:58,153;00:40:01,159;and some hard cheese.
615;00:40:01,264;00:40:03,000;You're a good lad.
616;00:40:03,061;00:40:05,085;Any word of Shae?
617;00:40:05,156;00:40:06,700;I've heard nothing, my lord.
618;00:40:06,755;00:40:09,506;I suppose that's a good thing.
619;00:40:10,962;00:40:13,356;What are they saying
619;00:40:10,962;00:40:13,356;about me out there?
620;00:40:13,440;00:40:16,382;You're to stand trial
620;00:40:13,440;00:40:16,382;in a fortnight
621;00:40:16,485;00:40:18,219;for murdering the king.
622;00:40:18,280;00:40:20,402;Do you believe
622;00:40:18,280;00:40:20,402;I murdered Joffrey?
623;00:40:20,476;00:40:22,292;No, my lord.
624;00:40:22,356;00:40:24,155;You didn't?
625;00:40:24,218;00:40:26,838;No. Gods, no.
626;00:40:26,930;00:40:29,100;The world is a better
626;00:40:26,930;00:40:29,100;place without him,
627;00:40:29,176;00:40:31,345;but I had nothing to do with it.
628;00:40:31,421;00:40:33,430;I would like to think
629;00:40:33,501;00:40:35,541;if I were arranging
629;00:40:33,501;00:40:35,541;a royal assassination,
630;00:40:35,612;00:40:38,071;I'd plan it in such a way that
630;00:40:35,612;00:40:38,071;I wouldn't be standing there
631;00:40:38,157;00:40:41,242;gawking like a fool
631;00:40:38,157;00:40:41,242;when the king died.
632;00:40:42,682;00:40:45,254;Trial in a fortnight.
633;00:40:45,344;00:40:47,811;Have they announced
633;00:40:45,344;00:40:47,811;the judges yet?
634;00:40:50,000;00:40:53,135;Your father.
634;00:40:50,000;00:40:53,135;Of course.
635;00:40:53,244;00:40:55,735;Mace Tyrell.
636;00:40:55,823;00:40:58,989;Who will vote exactly as my
636;00:40:55,823;00:40:58,989;father tells him to vote.
637;00:40:59,099;00:41:01,525;And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.
638;00:41:01,610;00:41:03,442;Oberyn?
639;00:41:03,506;00:41:05,773;Give it to my father.
640;00:41:05,853;00:41:08,537;He never fails to take
640;00:41:05,853;00:41:08,537;advantage of a family tragedy.
641;00:41:08,631;00:41:11,813;I'm supposed to get a list
641;00:41:08,631;00:41:11,813;of names from you, my lord.
642;00:41:11,924;00:41:14,848;Anyone who might testify
642;00:41:11,924;00:41:14,848;on your behalf.
643;00:41:14,950;00:41:17,330;Oh, I can call my own witnesses?
644;00:41:17,413;00:41:18,923;How generous of them.
645;00:41:18,976;00:41:20,872;Very well, my wife.
645;00:41:18,976;00:41:20,872;Sansa.
646;00:41:20,939;00:41:22,594;My lord, she's gone.
647;00:41:22,652;00:41:25,971;Gone?
647;00:41:22,652;00:41:25,971;- No one's seen her since the wedding.
648;00:41:29,056;00:41:31,491;You don't think she...
649;00:41:35,044;00:41:38,338;No one had more cause
649;00:41:35,044;00:41:38,338;to kill Joffrey than Sansa,
650;00:41:38,453;00:41:40,334;but the girl is no assassin.
651;00:41:40,400;00:41:43,533;Whoever killed the king wanted
651;00:41:40,400;00:41:43,533;me to lose my head for it.
652;00:41:43,642;00:41:47,227;And with my wife's disappearance, it
652;00:41:43,642;00:41:47,227;makes me seem that much more guilty.
653;00:41:47,352;00:41:49,955;Podrick.
653;00:41:47,352;00:41:49,955;Yes, my lord?
654;00:41:50,046;00:41:51,654;They'll be following you now.
654;00:41:50,046;00:41:51,654;Who will?
655;00:41:51,711;00:41:54,443;I don't know. They.
655;00:41:51,711;00:41:54,443;They. The ominous they.
656;00:41:54,539;00:41:57,399;The man pulling the strings.
656;00:41:54,539;00:41:57,399;Or woman. My father.
657;00:41:57,498;00:42:00,793;Maybe Joffrey
657;00:41:57,498;00:42:00,793;was too much work for him.
658;00:42:00,908;00:42:03,785;Sweet Tommen will be
658;00:42:00,908;00:42:03,785;so much easier to handle.
659;00:42:03,886;00:42:06,618;Whenever something
659;00:42:03,886;00:42:06,618;bad happens to me,
660;00:42:06,713;00:42:09,060;I assume it's my sister
660;00:42:06,713;00:42:09,060;that had a hand in it.
661;00:42:09,143;00:42:11,634;But say what you will of Cersei,
662;00:42:11,721;00:42:13,327;she loves her children.
663;00:42:13,383;00:42:17,241;She is the only one I'm certain had
663;00:42:13,383;00:42:17,241;nothing to do with this murder.
664;00:42:17,376;00:42:19,417;Which makes it unique
665;00:42:19,488;00:42:21,802;as King's Landing murders go.
666;00:42:21,883;00:42:24,712;Any other witnesses, my lord?
667;00:42:24,811;00:42:26,899;Varys could vouch
667;00:42:24,811;00:42:26,899;for me if he dared.
668;00:42:26,972;00:42:29,110;He's already been called
668;00:42:26,972;00:42:29,110;as a witness for the queen.
669;00:42:29,185;00:42:31,515;Of course. Fetch Bronn.
669;00:42:29,185;00:42:31,515;I have a job for him.
670;00:42:31,597;00:42:32,914;I've already asked, my lord.
671;00:42:32,960;00:42:34,374;They won't let him see you.
671;00:42:32,960;00:42:34,374;Why not?
672;00:42:34,424;00:42:37,398;They say he's a known cutthroat
672;00:42:34,424;00:42:37,398;and your close associate.

678;00:43:04,565;00:43:07,105;he came to ask if
678;00:43:04,565;00:43:07,105;I'd testify against you.
679;00:43:07,193;00:43:09,957;Said I'd be named
