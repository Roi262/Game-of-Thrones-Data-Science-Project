5;00:00:10,186;00:00:13,356;I've seen making grand claims

7;00:00:15,793;00:00:18,261;He raised me up

10;00:00:23,435;00:00:26,237;It was Stannis.
10;00:00:23,435;00:00:26,237;Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.
11;00:00:26,272;00:00:28,073;Don't tell him that.
12;00:00:28,107;00:00:30,008;Does it give you joy
12;00:00:28,107;00:00:30,008;to scare people?
13;00:00:30,042;00:00:32,311;No, it gives me joy
13;00:00:30,042;00:00:32,311;to kill people.
14;00:00:32,345;00:00:34,546;Killing's the sweetest
14;00:00:32,345;00:00:34,546;thing there is.

16;00:00:37,117;00:00:39,619;to the battlefield to die.
17;00:00:39,653;00:00:41,220;He needs to be out there.

19;00:00:43,390;00:00:46,826;hiding behind his mother's skirts.

28;00:01:06,512;00:01:10,582;I'll give him a red smile.
29;00:01:10,616;00:01:14,319;If the wind holds, we'll reach
29;00:01:10,616;00:01:14,319;King's Landing in a day.

127;00:10:27,539;00:10:29,314;with an iron poker.
128;00:10:29,339;00:10:30,841;Ooh.
129;00:10:30,842;00:10:33,143;Oh, it wasn't me
129;00:10:30,842;00:10:33,143;she was aiming at.
130;00:10:33,178;00:10:35,212;She was trying
130;00:10:33,178;00:10:35,212;for me little brother.
131;00:10:35,247;00:10:36,880;Now he was a real pest.
132;00:10:36,915;00:10:40,817;Second time I was nine.
133;00:10:40,851;00:10:43,953;Got in a scrap
133;00:10:40,851;00:10:43,953;with a few older boys.
134;00:10:43,988;00:10:46,189;They won.
135;00:10:46,223;00:10:47,824;Third time...
136;00:10:55,232;00:10:58,168;Eh, you don't want to know
136;00:10:55,232;00:10:58,168;about the third time.
137;00:11:01,840;00:11:03,841;Poor nose.
138;00:11:03,876;00:11:05,677;Don't feel sorry
138;00:11:03,876;00:11:05,677;for him.
139;00:11:05,711;00:11:07,913;He'll be halfway up your ass
139;00:11:05,711;00:11:07,913;before the night's through.
140;00:11:19,559;00:11:21,594;Welcome, friends.
141;00:11:25,365;00:11:27,299;This round's on me.
142;00:11:36,877;00:11:38,778;I don't think
142;00:11:36,877;00:11:38,778;he likes me.
143;00:11:52,026;00:11:53,726;You think
143;00:11:52,026;00:11:53,726;you're a hard man?
144;00:11:55,663;00:11:59,166;I know it.
145;00:12:02,403;00:12:04,604;It's warm in here.
146;00:12:04,639;00:12:06,640;We've got beautiful women
147;00:12:06,674;00:12:08,308;and good brown ale.
148;00:12:08,342;00:12:11,311;Plenty for everyone.
149;00:12:11,345;00:12:13,046;And all you want
150;00:12:13,080;00:12:16,082;is to put one of us
150;00:12:13,080;00:12:16,082;in the cold ground
151;00:12:16,117;00:12:18,018;with no women
151;00:12:16,117;00:12:18,018;to keep us company.
152;00:12:18,052;00:12:20,987;Oh, there's women
152;00:12:18,052;00:12:20,987;in the ground.
153;00:12:21,021;00:12:23,656;I put some there myself.
154;00:12:23,691;00:12:26,859;So have you.
155;00:12:26,894;00:12:29,328;You like fucking
155;00:12:26,894;00:12:29,328;and drinking
156;00:12:29,363;00:12:31,230;and singing.
157;00:12:33,266;00:12:35,801;But killing--
158;00:12:35,835;00:12:38,670;killing's the thing
158;00:12:35,835;00:12:38,670;you love.
159;00:12:38,704;00:12:41,773;You're just like me.
160;00:12:44,509;00:12:46,610;Only smaller.
161;00:12:48,513;00:12:50,280;And quicker.
162;00:12:50,315;00:12:53,183;Eh?
163;00:12:54,619;00:12:57,354;Your Lord Imp
163;00:12:54,619;00:12:57,354;is gonna miss you.
164;00:13:03,195;00:13:05,998;Aye.
165;00:13:07,701;00:13:10,870;I expect he will someday.
166;00:13:14,007;00:13:17,343;Here we are.
167;00:13:28,187;00:13:30,655;One more drink
167;00:13:28,187;00:13:30,655;before the war?
168;00:13:30,689;00:13:32,790;Shall we?
169;00:13:43,668;00:13:46,102;I've always
169;00:13:43,668;00:13:46,102;hated the bells.
170;00:13:46,136;00:13:47,937;They ring for horror--
171;00:13:47,971;00:13:50,640;a dead king,
171;00:13:47,971;00:13:50,640;a city under siege.
172;00:13:50,674;00:13:52,876;A wedding.
172;00:13:50,674;00:13:52,876;Exactly.
173;00:13:55,013;00:13:56,915;Podrick, is that it?
174;00:13:56,949;00:13:59,284;Is that it?
174;00:13:56,949;00:13:59,284;Nice touch.
175;00:13:59,318;00:14:02,788;As if you don't know the name
175;00:13:59,318;00:14:02,788;of every boy in town.
176;00:14:02,822;00:14:05,525;I'm not entirely sure
176;00:14:02,822;00:14:05,525;what you're suggesting.
177;00:14:05,559;00:14:08,995;I'm entirely sure you're entirely
177;00:14:05,559;00:14:08,995;sure what I'm suggesting.
178;00:14:09,030;00:14:11,564;Do you trust him?
179;00:14:14,935;00:14:16,769;Oddly enough, I do.
180;00:14:17,938;00:14:19,905;Good.
181;00:14:25,077;00:14:27,211;The map you asked for.
182;00:14:31,649;00:14:34,052;There must be 20 miles
182;00:14:31,649;00:14:34,052;of tunnels beneath the city.
183;00:14:34,086;00:14:35,787;Closer to 50.
184;00:14:35,821;00:14:39,491;The Targaryens built this
184;00:14:35,821;00:14:39,491;city to withstand a siege
185;00:14:39,525;00:14:43,262;and to provide escape
185;00:14:39,525;00:14:43,262;if necessary.
186;00:14:43,296;00:14:45,231;I'm not escaping.
187;00:14:45,265;00:14:47,233;Strange as it sounds,
187;00:14:45,265;00:14:47,233;I'm the captain of the ship.
188;00:14:47,267;00:14:48,935;And if the ship goes down,
188;00:14:47,267;00:14:48,935;I go with her.
189;00:14:48,969;00:14:50,804;That is good to hear.
190;00:14:50,838;00:14:52,972;Though I'm sure many
190;00:14:50,838;00:14:52,972;captains say the same
191;00:14:53,007;00:14:56,476;while their ship
191;00:14:53,007;00:14:56,476;is afloat.
192;00:14:56,510;00:14:59,245;You look well suited
192;00:14:56,510;00:14:59,245;for battle, My Lord.
193;00:14:59,279;00:15:00,647;Well, I'm not.
194;00:15:00,681;00:15:03,616;For all our sakes,
194;00:15:00,681;00:15:03,616;I hope you are wrong.
195;00:15:03,650;00:15:07,753;My little birds tell me
195;00:15:03,650;00:15:07,753;that Stannis Baratheon
196;00:15:07,788;00:15:11,323;has taken up with a Red
196;00:15:07,788;00:15:11,323;Priestess from Asshai.
197;00:15:11,358;00:15:12,691;What of it?
198;00:15:12,726;00:15:16,229;You don't believe in
198;00:15:12,726;00:15:16,229;the old powers, My Lord?
199;00:15:16,296;00:15:19,432;Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting--
199;00:15:16,296;00:15:19,432;what do you think?
200;00:15:19,466;00:15:24,003;I think you believe
200;00:15:19,466;00:15:24,003;in what you see
201;00:15:24,038;00:15:26,806;and in what those
201;00:15:24,038;00:15:26,806;you trust have seen.
202;00:15:28,008;00:15:30,943;You probably don't
202;00:15:28,008;00:15:30,943;entirely trust me.
203;00:15:30,977;00:15:32,878;Mm, don't take it
203;00:15:30,977;00:15:32,878;personally.
204;00:15:32,912;00:15:34,847;I don't entirely
204;00:15:32,912;00:15:34,847;trust myself.
205;00:15:34,881;00:15:37,716;And yet I have seen things
206;00:15:37,750;00:15:40,385;and heard things--
207;00:15:40,419;00:15:45,088;things you have not,
207;00:15:40,419;00:15:45,088;things I wish I had not.
208;00:15:47,625;00:15:50,760;I don't believe I've ever
208;00:15:47,625;00:15:50,760;told you how I was cut.
209;00:15:51,997;00:15:54,364;No, I don't believe
209;00:15:51,997;00:15:54,364;you have.
210;00:15:56,001;00:15:58,203;One day I will.
211;00:16:00,072;00:16:03,809;The dark arts have provided
211;00:16:00,072;00:16:03,809;Lord Stannis with his armies
212;00:16:03,877;00:16:07,146;and paved his path
212;00:16:03,877;00:16:07,146;to our door.
213;00:16:07,181;00:16:11,384;For a man in service to such
213;00:16:07,181;00:16:11,384;powers to sit on the Iron Throne,
214;00:16:11,419;00:16:14,787;I can think
214;00:16:11,419;00:16:14,787;of nothing worse.
215;00:16:14,821;00:16:16,288;And tonight,
216;00:16:16,322;00:16:20,592;I believe you are the only man
216;00:16:16,322;00:16:20,592;who can stop him.
217;00:16:47,020;00:16:49,156;They're welcoming
217;00:16:47,020;00:16:49,156;the new king.
218;00:16:49,190;00:16:52,025;I've never known bells
218;00:16:49,190;00:16:52,025;to mean surrender.
219;00:16:53,360;00:16:55,295;They want to play
219;00:16:53,360;00:16:55,295;music with us? Let's play.
220;00:16:55,329;00:16:58,230;Drums.
220;00:16:55,329;00:16:58,230;Drums!
221;00:17:23,657;00:17:24,790;Remember, wait till the shit--
222;00:17:24,824;00:17:26,726;The ships are in the bay.
223;00:17:26,760;00:17:28,113;They must be far enough
223;00:17:26,760;00:17:28,113;in so they won't be--
224;00:17:28,138;00:17:29,763;I know what in means.
225;00:17:29,764;00:17:32,132;Do you know how to use that?
225;00:17:29,764;00:17:32,132;I chopped wood once.
226;00:17:32,166;00:17:34,601;No, I watched my brother
226;00:17:32,166;00:17:34,601;chopping wood.
227;00:17:34,635;00:17:36,502;I saw you kill a man
227;00:17:34,635;00:17:36,502;with a shield.
228;00:17:36,537;00:17:38,438;You'll be unstoppable
228;00:17:36,537;00:17:38,438;with an axe.
229;00:17:39,740;00:17:42,275;Don't get killed.
229;00:17:39,740;00:17:42,275;Nor you, my friend.
230;00:17:42,310;00:17:45,679;Oh, are we friends now?
230;00:17:42,310;00:17:45,679;Of course we are.
231;00:17:45,713;00:17:47,419;Just because I pay you
231;00:17:45,713;00:17:47,419;for your services doesn't
232;00:17:47,444;00:17:48,748;diminish our friendship.
233;00:17:48,749;00:17:50,216;Enhances it, really.
234;00:17:50,250;00:17:53,019;Oh, enhances.
234;00:17:50,250;00:17:53,019;Fancy word for a sellsword.
235;00:17:53,053;00:17:55,887;Been spending time
235;00:17:53,053;00:17:55,887;with fancy folks.
236;00:18:06,965;00:18:10,167;Lady Sansa
236;00:18:06,965;00:18:10,167;and, uh, Sheila.
237;00:18:10,201;00:18:11,836;Shae.
238;00:18:11,870;00:18:13,438;Shae, yes.
239;00:18:13,472;00:18:15,573;Surely my sister
239;00:18:13,472;00:18:15,573;has asked you to join
240;00:18:15,608;00:18:17,242;the other highborn ladies
240;00:18:15,608;00:18:17,242;in Maegor's holdfast.
241;00:18:17,277;00:18:18,666;She has, My Lord,
242;00:18:18,691;00:18:20,812;but King Joffrey sent
242;00:18:18,691;00:18:20,812;for me to see him off.
243;00:18:21,014;00:18:23,049;Sansa.
244;00:18:23,083;00:18:25,251;He's been a great
244;00:18:23,083;00:18:25,251;romantic, my nephew.
245;00:18:25,285;00:18:27,186;Sansa, come here.
246;00:18:29,556;00:18:31,957;I will pray for your
246;00:18:29,556;00:18:31,957;safe return, My Lord.
247;00:18:31,992;00:18:33,492;Will you?
248;00:18:33,526;00:18:36,028;Just as I pray
248;00:18:33,526;00:18:36,028;for the King's.
249;00:18:40,333;00:18:41,767;Stay safe, My Lady.
250;00:18:41,801;00:18:43,935;And you, my lion.
251;00:18:49,141;00:18:52,009;Your king rides forth
251;00:18:49,141;00:18:52,009;to battle.
252;00:18:52,043;00:18:54,979;You should see him
252;00:18:52,043;00:18:54,979;off with a kiss.
253;00:18:55,014;00:18:57,248;My new blade.
254;00:18:57,283;00:18:59,050;Hearteater I've named it.
255;00:19:01,453;00:19:03,121;Kiss it.
256;00:19:12,698;00:19:14,665;You'll kiss it again
256;00:19:12,698;00:19:14,665;when I return
257;00:19:14,700;00:19:16,634;and taste
257;00:19:14,700;00:19:16,634;my Uncle's blood.
258;00:19:16,668;00:19:18,435;Will you slay him
258;00:19:16,668;00:19:18,435;yourself?
259;00:19:18,469;00:19:21,905;If Stannis is fool enough
259;00:19:18,469;00:19:21,905;to come near me.
260;00:19:21,939;00:19:24,941;So you'll be outside the gates
260;00:19:21,939;00:19:24,941;fighting in the Vanguard?
261;00:19:24,975;00:19:27,710;A king doesn't discuss
262;00:19:27,745;00:19:30,146;battle plans
262;00:19:27,745;00:19:30,146;with stupid girls.
263;00:19:30,180;00:19:33,116;I'm sorry, Your Grace.
263;00:19:30,180;00:19:33,116;You're right, I'm stupid.
264;00:19:33,150;00:19:35,352;Of course you'll be
264;00:19:33,150;00:19:35,352;in the Vanguard.
265;00:19:35,386;00:19:37,354;They say my brother
265;00:19:35,386;00:19:37,354;Robb always goes
266;00:19:37,389;00:19:39,056;where the fighting
266;00:19:37,389;00:19:39,056;is thickest.
267;00:19:39,091;00:19:40,891;And he is only
267;00:19:39,091;00:19:40,891;a pretender.
268;00:19:40,926;00:19:43,528;Your brother's turn
268;00:19:40,926;00:19:43,528;will come.
269;00:19:43,562;00:19:46,531;Then you can lick his blood
269;00:19:43,562;00:19:46,531;off Hearteater, too.
270;00:19:58,644;00:20:01,479;Some of those boys
270;00:19:58,644;00:20:01,479;will never come back.
271;00:20:01,513;00:20:03,648;Joffrey will.
272;00:20:03,682;00:20:05,416;The worst ones
272;00:20:03,682;00:20:05,416;always live.
273;00:20:05,450;00:20:08,452;Shh.
273;00:20:05,450;00:20:08,452;Come, My Lady.
274;00:20:55,573;00:20:59,476;Where's our fleet?
274;00:20:55,573;00:20:59,476;On the way.
275;00:20:59,687;00:21:02,924;Why isn't it here now?
275;00:20:59,687;00:21:02,924;They're coming.
276;00:21:03,679;00:21:07,282;Hound, tell the Hand that his
276;00:21:03,679;00:21:07,282;King has asked him a question.
277;00:21:07,316;00:21:09,351;The King has asked
277;00:21:07,316;00:21:09,351;you a question.
278;00:21:09,385;00:21:11,820;Ser Lancel, tell the Hound
278;00:21:09,385;00:21:11,820;to tell the king
279;00:21:11,855;00:21:13,655;that the Hand
279;00:21:11,855;00:21:13,655;is extremely busy.
280;00:21:13,690;00:21:15,465;The Hand of the King
280;00:21:13,690;00:21:15,465;would like me to tell
281;00:21:15,490;00:21:16,858;you to tell the King--
282;00:21:16,859;00:21:18,593;If I tell the Hound
282;00:21:16,859;00:21:18,593;to cut you in half,
283;00:21:18,627;00:21:20,161;he'll do it without
283;00:21:18,627;00:21:20,161;a second thought.
284;00:21:20,196;00:21:21,996;That would make me
284;00:21:20,196;00:21:21,996;the Quarterman.
285;00:21:22,030;00:21:25,065;It just doesn't have
285;00:21:22,030;00:21:25,065;the same ring to it.
286;00:21:25,100;00:21:27,901;Cut me in half and I won't
286;00:21:25,100;00:21:27,901;be able to give the signal.
287;00:21:27,935;00:21:29,569;No signal, no plan.
288;00:21:29,603;00:21:31,643;No plan and Stannis
288;00:21:29,603;00:21:31,643;Baratheon sacks this city,
289;00:21:31,668;00:21:34,516;takes the Iron Throne,
289;00:21:31,668;00:21:34,516;puts your pinched
290;00:21:34,517;00:21:36,064;little head atop
290;00:21:34,517;00:21:36,064;a gate somewhere.
291;00:21:36,311;00:21:38,679;It might be quite amusing,
292;00:21:38,713;00:21:40,548;except that my head
292;00:21:38,713;00:21:40,548;would be up there, too.
293;00:21:40,582;00:21:42,450;I've never much
293;00:21:40,582;00:21:42,450;liked my head,
294;00:21:42,484;00:21:45,987;but I don't want to see
294;00:21:42,484;00:21:45,987;it removed just yet.
295;00:21:48,391;00:21:50,059;Where are their ships?
296;00:21:50,093;00:21:52,928;It is wise to attack at night.
296;00:21:50,093;00:21:52,928;We took them by surprise.
297;00:21:52,963;00:21:56,065;Lord Varys knows what you had
297;00:21:52,963;00:21:56,065;for breakfast three days ago.
298;00:21:56,099;00:21:57,699;There are
298;00:21:56,099;00:21:57,699;no surprises here.
299;00:21:57,734;00:21:59,668;If it's true there is dissension
299;00:21:57,734;00:21:59,668;in their ranks,
300;00:21:59,702;00:22:01,870;maybe their sailors
300;00:21:59,702;00:22:01,870;have mutinied.
301;00:22:01,904;00:22:04,006;Maybe.
302;00:22:19,755;00:22:21,789;I don't know why
302;00:22:19,755;00:22:21,789;she wants me here.
303;00:22:21,823;00:22:24,759;She's always saying
303;00:22:21,823;00:22:24,759;how stupid I am. She hates me.
304;00:22:24,793;00:22:28,996;Maybe she hates you less than
304;00:22:24,793;00:22:28,996;she hates everyone else.
305;00:22:29,031;00:22:30,999;I doubt it.
306;00:22:31,033;00:22:33,935;Maybe she's
306;00:22:31,033;00:22:33,935;jealous of you.
307;00:22:33,969;00:22:35,937;Why would she
307;00:22:33,969;00:22:35,937;be jealous?
308;00:22:35,972;00:22:37,973;Sansa.
309;00:22:41,144;00:22:44,013;I was wondering where
309;00:22:41,144;00:22:44,013;our little dove had flown.
310;00:22:44,047;00:22:47,484;You look pale, child.
311;00:22:47,518;00:22:49,619;Is your red flower
311;00:22:47,518;00:22:49,619;still blooming?
312;00:22:49,654;00:22:51,822;Yes.
313;00:22:51,856;00:22:53,523;Fitting, isn't it?
314;00:22:53,558;00:22:57,494;The men will bleed out there
314;00:22:53,558;00:22:57,494;and you will bleed in here.
315;00:22:57,528;00:22:59,529;Pour Lady Sansa
315;00:22:57,528;00:22:59,529;some wine.
316;00:22:59,564;00:23:01,398;I'm not thirsty,
316;00:22:59,564;00:23:01,398;Your Grace.
317;00:23:01,432;00:23:04,968;So? I didn't
317;00:23:01,432;00:23:04,968;offer you water.
318;00:23:09,340;00:23:10,807;What's he doing here?
319;00:23:10,842;00:23:13,210;Ser Ilyn?
320;00:23:13,244;00:23:15,846;He's here to defend us.
321;00:23:15,880;00:23:17,581;When the axes smash
321;00:23:15,880;00:23:17,581;down those doors,
322;00:23:17,615;00:23:19,016;you may be glad
322;00:23:17,615;00:23:19,016;to have him.
323;00:23:19,050;00:23:21,318;But we have guards
323;00:23:19,050;00:23:21,318;to defend us.
324;00:23:21,353;00:23:22,986;Guards we have paid.
325;00:23:23,021;00:23:24,951;Should the city fall,
325;00:23:23,021;00:23:24,951;they'll be the first ones
326;00:23:24,976;00:23:26,557;out of the doors.
327;00:23:30,428;00:23:32,962;The lads caught a groom and
327;00:23:30,428;00:23:32,962;two maids trying to sneak away
328;00:23:32,997;00:23:35,465;with a stolen horse
328;00:23:32,997;00:23:35,465;and some gold cups.
329;00:23:35,500;00:23:37,768;The battle's first
329;00:23:35,500;00:23:37,768;traitors.
330;00:23:37,802;00:23:39,436;Have Ser Ilyn
330;00:23:37,802;00:23:39,436;see to them.
331;00:23:39,470;00:23:43,240;Put their heads on spikes outside
331;00:23:39,470;00:23:43,240;the stables as a warning.
332;00:23:45,477;00:23:47,311;The only way to keep
332;00:23:45,477;00:23:47,311;the small folk loyal
333;00:23:47,345;00:23:50,481;is to make certain they fear you
333;00:23:47,345;00:23:50,481;more than they do the enemy.
334;00:23:50,515;00:23:55,287;Remember that if you ever
334;00:23:50,515;00:23:55,287;hope to become a queen.
335;00:23:56,589;00:23:59,025;You said he was here
335;00:23:56,589;00:23:59,025;to protect us.
336;00:24:01,129;00:24:02,996;He is.
337;00:24:03,031;00:24:05,766;Traitors are a danger
337;00:24:03,031;00:24:05,766;to us all.
338;00:24:05,800;00:24:07,535;More wine.
339;00:24:22,017;00:24:23,951;There they are.
340;00:24:27,088;00:24:31,225;Archers to their marks.
340;00:24:27,088;00:24:31,225;Archers, to your marks!
341;00:24:32,927;00:24:35,062;Archers!
342;00:24:40,868;00:24:42,068;Nock your arrows!

345;00:24:48,575;00:24:50,776;What are you doing?
345;00:24:48,575;00:24:50,776;We need to attack them.
346;00:24:50,810;00:24:55,080;Hold fast.
346;00:24:50,810;00:24:55,080;- Boulders ready!
347;00:24:55,115;00:24:57,416;Hold fast!
348;00:24:58,852;00:25:02,054;There's only one ship.
348;00:24:58,852;00:25:02,054;Where are the rest of them?
349;00:25:02,989;00:25:05,057;Where are
349;00:25:02,989;00:25:05,057;the rest of them?!
350;00:25:09,429;00:25:10,929;There's only one ship.

352;00:25:16,737;00:25:18,138;Man the below!
353;00:25:18,172;00:25:20,707;Nock!

355;00:25:28,818;00:25:30,353;Hold.
356;00:25:30,387;00:25:32,422;Hold!
357;00:25:40,164;00:25:41,798;There's no one on board.
358;00:25:48,506;00:25:51,441;More rocks coming up!
359;00:26:06,390;00:26:08,258;Hold.
360;00:26:15,199;00:26:16,400;Wildfire.
361;00:26:16,434;00:26:19,603;Steer clear!
361;00:26:16,434;00:26:19,603;Steer clear!
362;00:26:44,361;00:26:46,829;Matthos!
362;00:26:44,361;00:26:46,829;Get down!
363;00:28:20,621;00:28:22,989;Prepare to land.
363;00:28:20,621;00:28:22,989;Your Grace...
364;00:28:23,024;00:28:25,125;The dwarf has played
364;00:28:23,024;00:28:25,125;his little trick.

365;00:28:25,159;00:28:27,594;He can only play it once.

369;00:28:35,636;00:28:37,771;Thousands.

371;00:29:11,805;00:29:13,605;little dove.

373;00:29:22,048;00:29:24,115;What are you doing?
374;00:29:24,150;00:29:25,450;Praying.
375;00:29:25,484;00:29:27,919;You're perfect,

376;00:29:27,954;00:29:30,288;Praying.
377;00:29:30,323;00:29:32,156;What are you praying for?
378;00:29:32,191;00:29:34,592;For the Gods to have

384;00:29:49,572;00:29:52,608;Praying to the Gods
384;00:29:49,572;00:29:52,608;to have mercy on us all.
385;00:29:52,642;00:29:55,111;The Gods have no mercy.
385;00:29:52,642;00:29:55,111;That's why they're Gods.
386;00:29:56,447;00:29:59,449;My father told me that
386;00:29:56,447;00:29:59,449;when he caught me praying.
387;00:30:00,652;00:30:02,887;My mother just died,
387;00:30:00,652;00:30:02,887;you see.
388;00:30:02,921;00:30:05,389;I didn't really understand
388;00:30:02,921;00:30:05,389;the concept of death,
389;00:30:05,424;00:30:07,925;the finality of it.
390;00:30:07,960;00:30:10,361;I thought that if I prayed
390;00:30:07,960;00:30:10,361;very, very hard,
391;00:30:10,396;00:30:13,597;the Gods would return
391;00:30:10,396;00:30:13,597;my mother to me. I was four.
392;00:30:13,632;00:30:16,400;Your father doesn't
392;00:30:13,632;00:30:16,400;believe in the Gods?
393;00:30:16,434;00:30:19,169;He believes in them, he just
393;00:30:16,434;00:30:19,169;doesn't like them very much.
394;00:30:22,273;00:30:24,207;One for her.
395;00:30:27,844;00:30:29,678;Here.
396;00:30:31,047;00:30:32,414;Sit.
397;00:30:32,448;00:30:34,450;Drink.
398;00:30:37,288;00:30:39,823;Not like that.
398;00:30:37,288;00:30:39,823;Drink, girl.
399;00:30:42,960;00:30:45,162;I should have been
399;00:30:42,960;00:30:45,162;born a man.
400;00:30:45,196;00:30:48,366;I'd rather face 1,000 swords
400;00:30:45,196;00:30:48,366;than be shut up inside
401;00:30:48,400;00:30:50,935;with this flock
401;00:30:48,400;00:30:50,935;of frightened hens.
402;00:30:50,969;00:30:53,305;They are your guests
402;00:30:50,969;00:30:53,305;under your protection.
403;00:30:53,339;00:30:54,773;You asked them here.
404;00:30:54,807;00:30:56,941;It was expected of me,
405;00:30:56,975;00:31:01,279;as it will be of you if you ever
405;00:30:56,975;00:31:01,279;become Joffrey's queen.
406;00:31:01,314;00:31:04,650;If my wretched brother
406;00:31:01,314;00:31:04,650;should somehow prevail,
407;00:31:04,684;00:31:08,520;these hens will return
407;00:31:04,684;00:31:08,520;to their cocks
408;00:31:08,588;00:31:11,991;and crow of how my courage
408;00:31:08,588;00:31:11,991;inspired them,
409;00:31:12,025;00:31:13,826;lifted their spirits.
410;00:31:13,860;00:31:16,129;And if the city
410;00:31:13,860;00:31:16,129;should fall?
411;00:31:18,098;00:31:20,933;You'd like that,
411;00:31:18,098;00:31:20,933;wouldn't you?
412;00:31:20,967;00:31:23,068;The Red Keep
412;00:31:20,967;00:31:23,068;should hold for a time,
413;00:31:23,103;00:31:24,904;long enough for me
413;00:31:23,103;00:31:24,904;to go to the walls
414;00:31:24,938;00:31:27,906;and yield to Lord Stannis
414;00:31:24,938;00:31:27,906;in person.
415;00:31:27,941;00:31:30,476;If it were anyone else
415;00:31:27,941;00:31:30,476;outside those gates,
416;00:31:30,510;00:31:32,445;I might have hoped
416;00:31:30,510;00:31:32,445;for a private audience.
417;00:31:32,479;00:31:35,348;But this is Stannis Baratheon.
418;00:31:35,382;00:31:39,151;I'd have a better chance
418;00:31:35,382;00:31:39,151;of seducing his horse.
419;00:31:42,188;00:31:44,389;Have I shocked you,
419;00:31:42,188;00:31:44,389;little dove?
420;00:31:44,424;00:31:47,526;Tears aren't a woman's
420;00:31:44,424;00:31:47,526;only weapon.
421;00:31:49,428;00:31:51,729;The best one's
421;00:31:49,428;00:31:51,729;between your legs.
422;00:31:51,764;00:31:55,000;Learn how to use it.
422;00:31:51,764;00:31:55,000;Drink.
423;00:31:58,337;00:32:00,472;Do you have any notion
423;00:31:58,337;00:32:00,472;of what happens
424;00:32:00,506;00:32:03,376;when a city is sacked?
425;00:32:03,410;00:32:06,012;No, you wouldn't,
425;00:32:03,410;00:32:06,012;would you?
426;00:32:07,081;00:32:11,152;If the city falls,
426;00:32:07,081;00:32:11,152;these fine women
427;00:32:11,186;00:32:14,221;should be in
427;00:32:11,186;00:32:14,221;for a bit of a rape.
428;00:32:14,256;00:32:16,090;Half of them
428;00:32:14,256;00:32:16,090;will have bastards
429;00:32:16,124;00:32:18,659;in their bellies
429;00:32:16,124;00:32:18,659;come the morning.
430;00:32:18,693;00:32:21,528;You'll be glad of
430;00:32:18,693;00:32:21,528;your red flower then.
431;00:32:22,530;00:32:23,997;When a man's blood
431;00:32:22,530;00:32:23,997;is up,
432;00:32:24,031;00:32:26,999;anything with tits
432;00:32:24,031;00:32:26,999;looks good.
433;00:32:27,033;00:32:28,667;A precious thing like you
434;00:32:28,702;00:32:32,671;will look very, very good.
435;00:32:32,705;00:32:34,940;A slice of cake
436;00:32:34,974;00:32:37,210;just waiting to be eaten.
437;00:32:39,580;00:32:42,782;More pressure!
438;00:32:52,260;00:32:55,262;Pull! Pull!
438;00:32:52,260;00:32:55,262;That's it, men!
439;00:32:55,296;00:32:58,498;Pull! Pull!
440;00:32:58,532;00:33:02,268;That's it!
440;00:32:58,532;00:33:02,268;Steady!
441;00:33:02,302;00:33:05,505;He's a serious man--
441;00:33:02,302;00:33:05,505;Stannis Baratheon.
442;00:33:05,539;00:33:07,974;They're coming.
442;00:33:05,539;00:33:07,974;They're coming ashore.
443;00:33:08,843;00:33:10,710;Rain fire on them.
444;00:33:10,744;00:33:12,478;Archers!
445;00:33:12,512;00:33:13,913;There are too many.
446;00:33:13,947;00:33:16,849;Hound, form a welcome party
446;00:33:13,947;00:33:16,849;for any Baratheon troop
447;00:33:16,917;00:33:19,218;that manages to touch
447;00:33:16,917;00:33:19,218;solid ground.
448;00:33:20,621;00:33:23,989;Pod, run to
448;00:33:20,621;00:33:23,989;the King's gate.
449;00:33:24,023;00:33:25,757;Bring any men
449;00:33:24,023;00:33:25,757;guarding it here now.
450;00:33:25,792;00:33:27,826;Yes, My Lord.
451;00:33:29,128;00:33:31,729;Let's go. Stannis is sending
451;00:33:29,128;00:33:31,729;us fresh meat.
452;00:33:31,764;00:33:33,698;You, too.
453;00:33:35,101;00:33:37,803;Any of these flaming
453;00:33:35,101;00:33:37,803;fucking arrows come near me,
454;00:33:37,837;00:33:40,240;I'll strangle you
454;00:33:37,837;00:33:40,240;with your own guts.
455;00:33:44,779;00:33:47,381;Pull, pull! Go!
456;00:33:47,416;00:33:49,517;Nock!
457;00:33:52,288;00:33:55,122;Draw!
458;00:33:55,157;00:33:58,459;Draw!
458;00:33:55,157;00:33:58,459;Draw!
459;00:34:06,535;00:34:08,470;Kill the Lannisters!
460;00:34:08,504;00:34:10,072;Loose!
461;00:34:10,106;00:34:11,473;Loose!
462;00:34:13,877;00:34:16,645;Form the line!
463;00:34:18,781;00:34:20,782;Stannis!
464;00:34:20,817;00:34:22,518;Draw!
464;00:34:20,817;00:34:22,518;Draw!
465;00:34:22,552;00:34:25,120;Loose!
465;00:34:22,552;00:34:25,120;Loose!
466;00:34:47,477;00:34:49,578;They cannot
466;00:34:47,477;00:34:49,578;breach the wall!
467;00:34:58,388;00:35:00,022;Yah!
468;00:35:09,765;00:35:11,566;The mud gate, go now!
469;00:35:11,600;00:35:14,769;First and second squads, to the gate!
469;00:35:11,600;00:35:14,769;To the mud gate!
470;00:35:14,803;00:35:16,803;Any man dies
470;00:35:14,803;00:35:16,803;with a clean sword,
471;00:35:16,838;00:35:19,806;I'll rape
471;00:35:16,838;00:35:19,806;his fucking corpse.
472;00:35:54,677;00:35:56,444;When we were young,
472;00:35:54,677;00:35:56,444;Jaime and I,
473;00:35:56,479;00:35:57,879;we looked so much alike.
474;00:35:57,914;00:36:00,282;Even our father
474;00:35:57,914;00:36:00,282;couldn't tell us apart.
475;00:36:00,316;00:36:04,920;I could never understand why
475;00:36:00,316;00:36:04,920;they treated us differently.
476;00:36:04,954;00:36:08,824;Jaime was taught to fight
476;00:36:04,954;00:36:08,824;with sword and lance and mace,
477;00:36:08,858;00:36:11,660;and I was taught to smile
478;00:36:11,694;00:36:13,595;and sing and please.
479;00:36:13,629;00:36:16,632;He was heir
479;00:36:13,629;00:36:16,632;to Casterly Rock
480;00:36:16,666;00:36:19,234;and I was sold to some
480;00:36:16,666;00:36:19,234;stranger like a horse
481;00:36:19,268;00:36:21,503;to be ridden
481;00:36:19,268;00:36:21,503;whenever he desired.
482;00:36:21,537;00:36:24,238;You were Robert's queen.
483;00:36:24,272;00:36:26,240;And you will be
483;00:36:24,272;00:36:26,240;Joffrey's. Enjoy.
484;00:36:30,244;00:36:31,878;I don't think
484;00:36:30,244;00:36:31,878;I know this one.
485;00:36:37,917;00:36:39,751;Pretty.
486;00:36:45,791;00:36:47,926;That's the worst
486;00:36:45,791;00:36:47,926;curtsy I've ever seen.
487;00:36:47,960;00:36:50,862;Here, it's not difficult.
487;00:36:47,960;00:36:50,862;I mastered it when I was four.
488;00:36:50,897;00:36:54,099;Straighten your back
488;00:36:50,897;00:36:54,099;and bend.
489;00:36:56,469;00:36:58,737;Better.
489;00:36:56,469;00:36:58,737;You learn fast.
490;00:36:58,772;00:37:02,742;How long have you been
490;00:36:58,772;00:37:02,742;in Lady Sansa's service?
491;00:37:02,776;00:37:05,712;A few weeks,
491;00:37:02,776;00:37:05,712;Your Grace.
492;00:37:08,448;00:37:10,816;When did you
492;00:37:08,448;00:37:10,816;leave Lorath?
493;00:37:12,185;00:37:14,786;I had a Lorathi
493;00:37:12,185;00:37:14,786;handmaiden once.
494;00:37:17,590;00:37:19,991;But she was
494;00:37:17,590;00:37:19,991;a nobleman's daughter.
495;00:37:20,025;00:37:21,893;You're not.
496;00:37:25,664;00:37:27,498;When did you come
496;00:37:25,664;00:37:27,498;to Westeros?
497;00:37:27,532;00:37:30,868;10 years ago,
497;00:37:27,532;00:37:30,868;Your Grace.
498;00:37:30,902;00:37:34,104;From Lorathi commoner
498;00:37:30,902;00:37:34,104;to the Red Keep
499;00:37:34,138;00:37:38,008;in 10 years, all without
499;00:37:34,138;00:37:38,008;learning how to curtsy.
500;00:37:39,177;00:37:41,678;I imagine that's
500;00:37:39,177;00:37:41,678;a very interesting story.
501;00:37:42,546;00:37:44,014;What's your name?
502;00:37:44,048;00:37:46,550;Shae, Your Grace.
503;00:37:46,585;00:37:48,786;Tell us a story, Shae.
504;00:37:54,593;00:37:57,162;When I was 13, I--
505;00:37:58,698;00:38:00,132;Your Grace!
506;00:38:00,166;00:38:03,235;What news?
507;00:38:03,270;00:38:05,337;The Imp has set
507;00:38:03,270;00:38:05,337;the river afire.
508;00:38:05,372;00:38:07,906;Hundreds of ships
508;00:38:05,372;00:38:07,906;are burning, maybe more.
509;00:38:07,941;00:38:11,410;Stannis's fleet
509;00:38:07,941;00:38:11,410;destroyed, but...
510;00:38:11,444;00:38:14,646;But-- but his troops
