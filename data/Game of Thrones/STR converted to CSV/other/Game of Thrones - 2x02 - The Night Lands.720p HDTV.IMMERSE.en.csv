73;00:05:22,935;00:05:25,036;I asked you a question.
74;00:05:25,070;00:05:26,838;Aye, you did.
75;00:05:27,840;00:05:29,942;You asked
75;00:05:27,840;00:05:29,942;without manners
76;00:05:29,976;00:05:32,545;and I chose not to answer.
77;00:05:32,579;00:05:35,615;I have a royal warrant
78;00:05:35,650;00:05:39,286;for one of these gutter rats

79;00:05:41,757;00:05:44,792;Well, the thing is...

81;00:05:47,129;00:05:50,898;Now, that puts them beyond the

82;00:05:50,933;00:05:52,767;Does it?
83;00:05:53,602;00:05:55,169;It's a funny thing--
84;00:05:55,203;00:05:57,338;people worry so much
84;00:05:55,203;00:05:57,338;about their throats
85;00:05:57,373;00:06:00,742;that they forget
85;00:05:57,373;00:06:00,742;about what's down low.
86;00:06:00,776;00:06:04,980;Now I sharpened this blade
86;00:06:00,776;00:06:04,980;before breakfast.
87;00:06:05,014;00:06:09,384;I could shave a spider's arse

88;00:06:09,419;00:06:13,389;or I could nick
88;00:06:09,419;00:06:13,389;this artery in your leg.
89;00:06:13,423;00:06:15,992;And once it's nicked,
89;00:06:13,423;00:06:15,992;there's no one around here
90;00:06:16,026;00:06:19,095;who knows
90;00:06:16,026;00:06:19,095;how to unnick it.
91;00:06:19,163;00:06:21,931;We'll just keep that.
92;00:06:23,200;00:06:26,970;Good steel is always
92;00:06:23,200;00:06:26,970;needed on the Wall.
93;00:06:27,004;00:06:28,704;Seems you have
93;00:06:27,004;00:06:28,704;a choice--
94;00:06:28,739;00:06:32,942;you can die here at this crossroads
94;00:06:28,739;00:06:32,942;a long way from home,
95;00:06:32,976;00:06:35,811;or you can go back to your city
95;00:06:32,976;00:06:35,811;and tell your Masters
96;00:06:35,845;00:06:38,847;you didn't find
96;00:06:35,845;00:06:38,847;what you were looking for.
97;00:06:44,621;00:06:46,689;We're looking
97;00:06:44,621;00:06:46,689;for a boy named Gendry.
98;00:06:46,724;00:06:50,293;He carries
98;00:06:46,724;00:06:50,293;a bull's head helmet.
99;00:06:50,327;00:06:54,331;Anyone turning him over
99;00:06:50,327;00:06:54,331;will earn the King's reward.
100;00:06:54,365;00:06:57,334;We'll be back
100;00:06:54,365;00:06:57,334;with more men
101;00:06:57,368;00:07:00,203;and I'll be taking your head
101;00:06:57,368;00:07:00,203;home along with that bastard boy.

105;00:07:39,342;00:07:41,577;keeps me company.
106;00:07:41,611;00:07:44,680;We were just speaking
106;00:07:41,611;00:07:44,680;of your bravery

107;00:07:44,713;00:07:48,116;the Stark auxiliary forces.
108;00:07:48,184;00:07:51,553;It was quite a battle.

112;00:08:01,665;00:08:03,732;To find so lovely

114;00:08:05,602;00:08:07,837;it almost beggars belief.
115;00:08:08,973;00:08:10,908;Strange things do happen.
116;00:08:10,942;00:08:13,711;You should taste
116;00:08:10,942;00:08:13,711;her fish pie.
117;00:08:13,745;00:08:16,080;I don't think Lord Varys

118;00:08:16,114;00:08:19,083;How can you tell?
118;00:08:16,114;00:08:19,083;I can always tell.

119;00:08:19,118;00:08:21,319;and I can't let

120;00:08:21,353;00:08:23,521;get the best of us.
121;00:08:23,555;00:08:26,423;We'll make a fisherman

124;00:08:31,495;00:08:35,564;Friends are such
124;00:08:31,495;00:08:35,564;an important part of life.
125;00:08:35,598;00:08:38,066;Unfortunate that your father
125;00:08:35,598;00:08:38,066;didn't want her to come.
126;00:08:38,101;00:08:40,635;But rest easy, My Lord.
127;00:08:40,670;00:08:43,639;I am very good
127;00:08:40,670;00:08:43,639;at keeping secrets
128;00:08:43,673;00:08:45,874;for my good friends.
129;00:08:45,908;00:08:48,377;Your discretion
129;00:08:45,908;00:08:48,377;is legendary...
130;00:08:48,411;00:08:49,811;where your friends
130;00:08:48,411;00:08:49,811;are concerned.
131;00:08:49,846;00:08:52,314;How unspeakable of me
131;00:08:49,846;00:08:52,314;to go on and on
132;00:08:52,348;00:08:54,583;when all you want
132;00:08:52,348;00:08:54,583;to do is rest.
133;00:08:54,617;00:08:56,752;I will leave you.
134;00:08:58,155;00:08:59,922;Welcome to King's Landing,
134;00:08:58,155;00:08:59,922;my dear.
135;00:08:59,957;00:09:03,393;This city is made brighter
135;00:08:59,957;00:09:03,393;by your presence.
136;00:09:03,427;00:09:05,762;We have a council meeting,
136;00:09:03,427;00:09:05,762;My Lord.
137;00:09:09,333;00:09:11,601;I don't like threats.
138;00:09:11,636;00:09:13,904;Who threatened you?
138;00:09:11,636;00:09:13,904;I'm not Ned Stark.
139;00:09:13,938;00:09:16,072;I understand the way
139;00:09:13,938;00:09:16,072;this game is played.
140;00:09:16,107;00:09:17,707;Ned Stark
140;00:09:16,107;00:09:17,707;was a man of honor.
141;00:09:17,742;00:09:19,175;And I am not.
142;00:09:19,210;00:09:22,712;Threaten me again and I'll have
142;00:09:19,210;00:09:22,712;you thrown into the sea.
143;00:09:25,750;00:09:28,151;You might be disappointed
143;00:09:25,750;00:09:28,151;in the results.
144;00:09:28,185;00:09:31,154;Storms come and go,
145;00:09:31,188;00:09:33,356;the big fish eat
145;00:09:31,188;00:09:33,356;the little fish,
146;00:09:33,390;00:09:36,425;and I keep on paddling.
147;00:09:37,461;00:09:38,861;Come, My Lord.
148;00:09:38,895;00:09:41,263;We shouldn't keep
148;00:09:38,895;00:09:41,263;the queen waiting.
149;00:09:47,469;00:09:49,303;From this time
149;00:09:47,469;00:09:49,303;until the end of time,
150;00:09:49,337;00:09:51,171;we are not part
150;00:09:49,337;00:09:51,171;of your realm,
151;00:09:51,239;00:09:55,075;but a free and independent
151;00:09:51,239;00:09:55,075;kingdom of the North.
152;00:09:58,745;00:10:01,280;He has more spirit than
152;00:09:58,745;00:10:01,280;his father, I'll give him that.
153;00:10:01,314;00:10:04,617;You've perfected the art
153;00:10:01,314;00:10:04,617;of tearing up papers.
154;00:10:04,651;00:10:07,153;We can give him his father's bones
154;00:10:04,651;00:10:07,153;back at least
155;00:10:07,187;00:10:08,888;as a gesture
155;00:10:07,187;00:10:08,888;of good faith.
156;00:10:08,922;00:10:10,957;You'll give the Starks
156;00:10:08,922;00:10:10,957;our reply, cousin?
157;00:10:11,892;00:10:14,060;I will, Your Grace.
158;00:10:14,095;00:10:15,696;Did you see my brother
159;00:10:15,730;00:10:17,131;when you were
159;00:10:15,730;00:10:17,131;the Starks' guest?
160;00:10:17,165;00:10:19,066;I did.
161;00:10:19,101;00:10:21,802;They have not broken
161;00:10:19,101;00:10:21,802;his spirit, Your Grace.
162;00:10:22,671;00:10:25,539;If you speak with him,
163;00:10:25,574;00:10:28,475;tell him he's not
163;00:10:25,574;00:10:28,475;been forgotten.
164;00:10:28,510;00:10:30,844;I will, Your Grace.
164;00:10:28,510;00:10:30,844;Safe travels, cousin.
165;00:10:35,183;00:10:37,484;You have a deft hand
165;00:10:35,183;00:10:37,484;with diplomacy.
166;00:10:37,519;00:10:41,755;If that's everything...
166;00:10:37,519;00:10:41,755;A-- a raven flew in this morning
167;00:10:41,789;00:10:44,658;from Castle Black.
168;00:10:44,692;00:10:46,293;Trouble with
168;00:10:44,692;00:10:46,293;the wildlings.
169;00:10:46,327;00:10:48,795;That's why they're
169;00:10:46,327;00:10:48,795;called wildlings.
170;00:10:48,830;00:10:51,464;Somewhat less wild
170;00:10:48,830;00:10:51,464;these days.
171;00:10:51,499;00:10:53,300;Seems they've stopped
171;00:10:51,499;00:10:53,300;killing each other
172;00:10:53,334;00:10:56,437;and started following
172;00:10:53,334;00:10:56,437;this King-Beyond-the-Wall.
173;00:10:56,471;00:10:59,273;Another king?
173;00:10:56,471;00:10:59,273;How many is that now, five?
174;00:10:59,308;00:11:01,075;I've lost count.
175;00:11:01,109;00:11:04,912;The Lord Commander asks that we
175;00:11:01,109;00:11:04,912;send more men to man the Wall.
176;00:11:04,947;00:11:06,614;Perhaps he's forgotten
176;00:11:04,947;00:11:06,614;we're fighting a war.
177;00:11:06,648;00:11:08,616;We have no men to spare.
178;00:11:08,651;00:11:10,352;The cold winds
178;00:11:08,651;00:11:10,352;are rising
179;00:11:10,386;00:11:12,955;and the dead rise
179;00:11:10,386;00:11:12,955;with them.
180;00:11:12,989;00:11:16,592;The northerners are
180;00:11:12,989;00:11:16,592;a superstitious people.
181;00:11:16,626;00:11:18,694;According to the Commander,
181;00:11:16,626;00:11:18,694;one of these dead men
182;00:11:18,729;00:11:20,764;attacked him
182;00:11:18,729;00:11:20,764;in his chambers.
183;00:11:20,798;00:11:22,799;Mormont doesn't lie.
184;00:11:22,833;00:11:25,469;How do you kill
184;00:11:22,833;00:11:25,469;a dead man?
185;00:11:26,437;00:11:28,438;Apparently you burn him.
186;00:11:29,674;00:11:31,408;One trip to the Wall
186;00:11:29,674;00:11:31,408;and you come back
187;00:11:31,442;00:11:34,778;believing in grumpkins
187;00:11:31,442;00:11:34,778;and snarks.
188;00:11:35,746;00:11:38,348;I don't know
188;00:11:35,746;00:11:38,348;what I believe,
189;00:11:38,382;00:11:40,449;but here's
189;00:11:38,382;00:11:40,449;a fact for you--
190;00:11:40,484;00:11:42,084;the Night's Watch
190;00:11:40,484;00:11:42,084;is the only thing
191;00:11:42,118;00:11:44,786;that separates us from
191;00:11:42,118;00:11:44,786;what lies beyond the Wall.
192;00:11:44,821;00:11:47,222;I have every confidence
192;00:11:44,821;00:11:47,222;that the brave men
193;00:11:47,257;00:11:49,959;of the Night's Watch
193;00:11:47,257;00:11:49,959;will protect us all.
194;00:11:51,561;00:11:53,162;And I said,
195;00:11:53,196;00:11:54,863;if the Gods wanted us
195;00:11:53,196;00:11:54,863;to have dignity,
196;00:11:54,898;00:11:57,766;they wouldn't make us
196;00:11:54,898;00:11:57,766;fart when we died.
197;00:11:59,035;00:12:01,502;We fart when we die?
198;00:12:01,537;00:12:03,471;My blessed mother--
199;00:12:03,505;00:12:05,573;I was holding her hand
199;00:12:03,505;00:12:05,573;when she left this world.
200;00:12:05,607;00:12:09,176;She farted so hard,
200;00:12:05,607;00:12:09,176;the whole bed shook.
201;00:12:18,986;00:12:22,288;Seems a bit greedy for one man
201;00:12:18,986;00:12:22,288;to have so many wives.
202;00:12:22,323;00:12:24,791;Wouldn't two or three
202;00:12:22,323;00:12:24,791;be enough for him?
203;00:12:24,826;00:12:27,728;We were having
203;00:12:24,826;00:12:27,728;a serious discussion.
204;00:12:28,864;00:12:30,965;Would you look at that?
205;00:12:32,301;00:12:35,204;Nothing like the sight
205;00:12:32,301;00:12:35,204;of a woman walking away.
206;00:12:35,238;00:12:38,107;I prefer watching them
206;00:12:35,238;00:12:38,107;come towards me.
207;00:12:38,141;00:12:39,742;I'm sure
207;00:12:38,141;00:12:39,742;that's nice, too.
208;00:12:39,776;00:12:42,911;Yeah, well, there was
208;00:12:39,776;00:12:42,911;a milkmaid named Violet
209;00:12:42,945;00:12:45,514;on the next farm over
209;00:12:42,945;00:12:45,514;from where I grew up.
210;00:12:45,548;00:12:48,516;We were wrestling together
210;00:12:45,548;00:12:48,516;from the time we were six years old.
211;00:12:48,551;00:12:53,521;And then we got older
211;00:12:48,551;00:12:53,521;and the wrestling, uh...
212;00:12:54,523;00:12:56,757;Changed.
213;00:12:56,791;00:12:58,625;You were with her?
214;00:12:59,660;00:13:01,261;How many times?
215;00:13:01,295;00:13:03,797;Well, as many times
215;00:13:01,295;00:13:03,797;as I could.
216;00:13:07,001;00:13:09,603;I wish I grew up
216;00:13:07,001;00:13:09,603;on a farm.
217;00:13:09,638;00:13:10,972;We need more potatoes.
218;00:13:11,006;00:13:13,374;Get another sack
218;00:13:11,006;00:13:13,374;from the sledge.
219;00:13:16,612;00:13:18,880;Get the turnips, too.
220;00:13:30,292;00:13:33,894;No. Ghost, no.
221;00:13:33,928;00:13:36,363;No!
222;00:13:36,397;00:13:38,965;Ghost, away.
222;00:13:36,397;00:13:38,965;Shoo, shoo!
223;00:13:43,070;00:13:44,871;You all right?
224;00:13:44,906;00:13:47,708;Did he frighten you?
224;00:13:44,906;00:13:47,708;You-- you shouldn't touch me.
225;00:13:47,742;00:13:51,312;Oh. Oh, right.
226;00:13:51,346;00:13:52,981;I'm sorry.
227;00:13:53,015;00:13:55,784;I just wanted to make sure
227;00:13:53,015;00:13:55,784;you weren't hurt.
228;00:14:01,826;00:14:03,826;You're very brave.
229;00:14:14,170;00:14:16,171;What are you doing?
230;00:14:16,205;00:14:18,005;This is Gilly.
231;00:14:18,040;00:14:20,441;She's one of Craster's...
231;00:14:18,040;00:14:20,441;daughters.
232;00:14:20,790;00:14:22,324;Hello, Gilly.
232;00:14:20,790;00:14:22,324;What are you doing?
233;00:14:22,382;00:14:24,017;Sam said
233;00:14:22,382;00:14:24,017;you could help.
234;00:14:24,080;00:14:25,686;I'm sorry, but Sam knows
234;00:14:24,080;00:14:25,686;we're not supposed--
235;00:14:25,711;00:14:26,911;She's pregnant.
236;00:14:33,957;00:14:37,227;Have to take her
236;00:14:33,957;00:14:37,227;with us when we leave.
237;00:14:37,261;00:14:39,062;What?
238;00:14:39,096;00:14:40,897;What would that--
238;00:14:39,096;00:14:40,897;I know it sounds a bit mad.
239;00:14:40,932;00:14:42,665;No, it doesn't sound a bit mad,
239;00:14:40,932;00:14:42,665;it's impossible.
240;00:14:42,700;00:14:45,034;The Lord Commander ordered us to--
240;00:14:42,700;00:14:45,034;We are sworn to protect.
241;00:14:45,068;00:14:47,636;Sam, we can't take--
241;00:14:45,068;00:14:47,636;please, ser, please.
242;00:14:47,671;00:14:49,571;I can still run
242;00:14:47,671;00:14:49,571;if I have to.
243;00:14:49,606;00:14:52,007;It's just not possible.
243;00:14:49,606;00:14:52,007;I'm going to have a baby.
244;00:14:52,041;00:14:54,609;If it's a boy...
245;00:14:54,643;00:14:56,577;If it's a boy, what?
246;00:15:01,683;00:15:03,951;You want us to risk
246;00:15:01,683;00:15:03,951;our lives for you
247;00:15:03,985;00:15:06,087;and you won't even
247;00:15:03,985;00:15:06,087;tell us why?
248;00:15:11,726;00:15:14,729;Why'd you do that?
248;00:15:11,726;00:15:14,729;Do what? Ask her a question?
249;00:15:14,763;00:15:16,564;You were cruel.
249;00:15:14,763;00:15:16,564;Cruel?
250;00:15:16,599;00:15:18,566;Sam, are you in such a hurry
250;00:15:16,599;00:15:18,566;to lose a hand?
251;00:15:18,601;00:15:20,935;I didn't touch her.
251;00:15:18,601;00:15:20,935;No, you just want to steal her.
252;00:15:20,969;00:15:22,704;What do you think
252;00:15:20,969;00:15:22,704;Craster cuts off for that?
253;00:15:22,738;00:15:24,739;I can't steal her.
254;00:15:24,773;00:15:27,041;She's a person,
254;00:15:24,773;00:15:27,041;not a goat.
255;00:15:31,480;00:15:35,417;We're heading deeper and deeper
255;00:15:31,480;00:15:35,417;into wildling territory.
256;00:15:35,451;00:15:38,254;We can't take a girl with us.
256;00:15:35,451;00:15:38,254;Mormont wouldn't have it.
257;00:15:38,288;00:15:41,190;And even if he would,
257;00:15:38,288;00:15:41,190;what would we do with her?
258;00:15:41,224;00:15:43,092;Who's going to
258;00:15:41,224;00:15:43,092;deliver a baby, you?
259;00:15:44,295;00:15:46,296;I could try.
260;00:15:46,331;00:15:49,265;What?
260;00:15:46,331;00:15:49,265;I've read about it.
261;00:15:49,300;00:15:51,901;A bit.
262;00:15:53,337;00:15:55,706;I'm sorry, Sam.
263;00:15:55,740;00:15:57,641;We can't help her.
264;00:16:53,100;00:16:56,269;Khaleesi.
265;00:17:40,349;00:17:43,251;You don't need to see this.
265;00:17:40,349;00:17:43,251;He is blood of my blood.
266;00:17:47,023;00:17:50,025;Who did this?
266;00:17:47,023;00:17:50,025;Khal Pono, perhaps.
267;00:17:50,059;00:17:52,394;Khal Jhaqo.
268;00:17:52,428;00:17:55,497;They don't like the idea of a woman
268;00:17:52,428;00:17:55,497;leading a Khalasar.
269;00:17:55,532;00:17:58,766;They will like it far less
269;00:17:55,532;00:17:58,766;when I am done with them.
270;00:19:31,193;00:19:32,860;Is it as you remember,
270;00:19:31,193;00:19:32,860;My Lord?
271;00:19:32,894;00:19:35,095;It looks smaller.
272;00:19:35,129;00:19:36,963;Everything looks bigger
272;00:19:35,129;00:19:36,963;when you're a child.
273;00:19:36,997;00:19:38,898;I remember
273;00:19:36,997;00:19:38,898;my father's cabin
274;00:19:38,932;00:19:40,733;felt like a palace
274;00:19:38,932;00:19:40,733;when I was little.
275;00:19:40,767;00:19:44,270;Now look at it.
276;00:19:44,304;00:19:46,572;They'll be waiting
276;00:19:44,304;00:19:46,572;for me on the docks.
277;00:19:46,606;00:19:48,374;Who will?
278;00:19:48,408;00:19:50,242;Anyone who matters.
279;00:19:50,276;00:19:52,444;This is a big day for them.
280;00:19:52,479;00:19:55,981;They haven't had much to get
280;00:19:52,479;00:19:55,981;excited about since I left.
281;00:19:56,015;00:19:58,083;It's a hard place,
281;00:19:56,015;00:19:58,083;the Iron Islands.
282;00:19:58,118;00:19:59,652;Always has been.
283;00:19:59,686;00:20:01,921;It's cold and it's wet.
284;00:20:01,956;00:20:03,690;Oh, I love
284;00:20:01,956;00:20:03,690;the cold and wet.
285;00:20:03,724;00:20:06,292;They say hard places
285;00:20:03,724;00:20:06,292;breed hard men.
286;00:20:07,995;00:20:10,530;And hard men
286;00:20:07,995;00:20:10,530;rule the world.
287;00:20:11,698;00:20:15,034;Then you'll be king
287;00:20:11,698;00:20:15,034;before long.
288;00:20:17,337;00:20:20,840;Try smiling with
288;00:20:17,337;00:20:20,840;your lips closed.
289;00:20:20,874;00:20:23,008;Better.
290;00:20:25,412;00:20:28,347;My father doesn't trust
290;00:20:25,412;00:20:28,347;you Iron islanders.
291;00:20:28,381;00:20:30,349;I don't blame him.
292;00:20:30,383;00:20:33,386;He says that you're all
292;00:20:30,383;00:20:33,386;reavers and rapers
293;00:20:33,420;00:20:35,254;and that no matter
293;00:20:33,420;00:20:35,254;how many women you have,
294;00:20:35,288;00:20:37,289;you'll never be sat-- uh!
295;00:20:37,324;00:20:40,592;Quit talking about your father.
296;00:20:40,627;00:20:43,429;But he's right
296;00:20:40,627;00:20:43,429;about us.
297;00:20:43,463;00:20:47,165;Our wives from the Iron Islands,
297;00:20:43,463;00:20:47,165;they're for breeding.
298;00:20:47,200;00:20:49,568;That's not enough for us.
299;00:20:49,602;00:20:52,070;That's why
299;00:20:49,602;00:20:52,070;we take salt wives--
300;00:20:52,105;00:20:53,672;the women we capture.
301;00:20:53,707;00:20:55,207;Capture me.
302;00:20:55,242;00:20:57,342;Take me with you
302;00:20:55,242;00:20:57,342;when you go ashore.
303;00:20:57,377;00:21:01,514;Make me your salt wife.
303;00:20:57,377;00:21:01,514;Your place is on this ship.
304;00:21:01,548;00:21:03,682;Not after you leave.
305;00:21:03,717;00:21:06,051;Father will punish me.
306;00:21:06,086;00:21:07,686;He'll call me a whore.
307;00:21:08,755;00:21:11,257;I haven't paid you.
308;00:21:23,171;00:21:25,839;Oh, yeah.
309;00:21:35,050;00:21:37,985;- I paid good money...
310;00:21:47,462;00:21:49,830;I'm not going to stand for this.
311;00:21:49,865;00:21:51,565;I barely touched her.
312;00:21:51,600;00:21:53,801;Now, you charge twice as much
312;00:21:51,600;00:21:53,801;as every other brothel
313;00:21:53,835;00:21:55,702;and this is
313;00:21:53,835;00:21:55,702;what I get-- crying.
314;00:21:55,737;00:21:58,072;One moment, my friend.
314;00:21:55,737;00:21:58,072;A moment.
315;00:22:06,715;00:22:09,784;Please accept
315;00:22:06,715;00:22:09,784;my sincerest apologies.
316;00:22:09,818;00:22:12,186;Aremca will take
316;00:22:09,818;00:22:12,186;good care of you.
317;00:22:41,917;00:22:46,721;I'm sorry, My Lord.
317;00:22:41,917;00:22:46,721;Shh, shh.
318;00:22:47,790;00:22:49,791;Did he hurt you?
319;00:22:51,127;00:22:53,929;No, My Lord.
320;00:22:53,963;00:22:56,732;It's Mhaegen.
321;00:22:56,766;00:22:59,134;Who?
322;00:22:59,169;00:23:02,872;She works for you.
323;00:23:02,906;00:23:06,509;She's the one--
323;00:23:02,906;00:23:06,509;the Gold Cloaks,
324;00:23:06,543;00:23:08,844;they killed her baby.
324;00:23:06,543;00:23:08,844;Ah, yes.
325;00:23:08,879;00:23:11,547;That was...
326;00:23:11,581;00:23:13,783;poorly handled.
327;00:23:15,185;00:23:17,454;Sometimes those
327;00:23:15,185;00:23:17,454;with the most power
328;00:23:17,488;00:23:20,190;have the least grace.
329;00:23:20,224;00:23:23,794;I can't stop
329;00:23:20,224;00:23:23,794;thinking about it.
330;00:23:23,828;00:23:25,930;I can't sleep.
331;00:23:27,632;00:23:30,434;That poor little baby.
332;00:23:30,468;00:23:33,270;You know, you remind me
332;00:23:30,468;00:23:33,270;of another girl,
333;00:23:33,304;00:23:35,339;a lovely thing
333;00:23:33,304;00:23:35,339;I once acquired
334;00:23:35,373;00:23:38,375;from a Lysene
334;00:23:35,373;00:23:38,375;pleasure house--
335;00:23:38,410;00:23:41,545;beautiful, like yourself,
336;00:23:41,579;00:23:45,115;and intelligent,
336;00:23:41,579;00:23:45,115;like yourself.
337;00:23:45,150;00:23:48,018;But she wasn't happy.
338;00:23:49,087;00:23:52,423;She cried often.
339;00:23:52,457;00:23:56,560;I asked her why,
339;00:23:52,457;00:23:56,560;but we didn't have
340;00:23:56,595;00:23:59,464;the kind of rapport
340;00:23:56,595;00:23:59,464;that you and I have.
341;00:24:02,769;00:24:05,403;Yes, it was quite sad.
342;00:24:07,073;00:24:10,409;Girls from the Lysene
342;00:24:07,073;00:24:10,409;pleasure houses are expensive,
343;00:24:10,443;00:24:12,578;extremely expensive.
344;00:24:12,612;00:24:16,249;And this one wasn't
344;00:24:12,612;00:24:16,249;making me any money.
345;00:24:19,920;00:24:23,022;I hate bad investments.
346;00:24:23,056;00:24:26,091;Really, I-- I do.
347;00:24:26,125;00:24:28,160;They haunt me.
348;00:24:31,665;00:24:35,267;I had no idea
348;00:24:31,665;00:24:35,267;how to make her happy,
349;00:24:35,301;00:24:38,369;no idea how
349;00:24:35,301;00:24:38,369;to mitigate my losses.
350;00:24:39,738;00:24:42,006;A very wealthy patron,
350;00:24:39,738;00:24:42,006;he offered me
351;00:24:42,040;00:24:43,641;a tremendous
351;00:24:42,040;00:24:43,641;amount of money
352;00:24:43,675;00:24:48,646;to let him transform
352;00:24:43,675;00:24:48,646;this lovely, sad girl.
353;00:24:48,681;00:24:52,450;To use her
353;00:24:48,681;00:24:52,450;in ways that...
354;00:24:52,485;00:24:55,220;Would never occur
354;00:24:52,485;00:24:55,220;to most men.
355;00:24:56,489;00:24:59,624;And you know what
355;00:24:56,489;00:24:59,624;occurs to most men.
356;00:25:02,862;00:25:07,699;I would not say he succeeded in
356;00:25:02,862;00:25:07,699;making her happy,
357;00:25:07,733;00:25:12,337;but my losses were
357;00:25:07,733;00:25:12,337;definitely mitigated.
358;00:25:20,112;00:25:22,280;Take tonight off
358;00:25:20,112;00:25:22,280;to mourn Mhaegen's child.
359;00:25:23,849;00:25:25,750;I'll see you tomorrow.
360;00:25:25,784;00:25:28,553;And you'll be happy?
361;00:25:31,991;00:25:34,059;That makes me happy.
362;00:25:45,871;00:25:47,505;More wine?
363;00:25:48,841;00:25:50,541;Damn it, boy!
363;00:25:48,841;00:25:50,541;Apologies, My Lord.
364;00:25:50,576;00:25:54,612;Leave us, Podrick. I believe we
364;00:25:50,576;00:25:54,612;know how to pour our own wine.
365;00:25:55,548;00:25:57,182;That's your new squire?
366;00:25:57,216;00:25:59,250;I could've found you
366;00:25:57,216;00:25:59,250;a proper lad.
367;00:25:59,285;00:26:02,020;Myself, I prefer
367;00:25:59,285;00:26:02,020;the improper ones.
368;00:26:02,055;00:26:05,057;Mm, that's a good red.
368;00:26:02,055;00:26:05,057;Dornish?
369;00:26:05,091;00:26:06,558;You know your wines,
369;00:26:05,091;00:26:06,558;My Lord.
370;00:26:06,592;00:26:08,093;That I do.
371;00:26:08,128;00:26:10,930;A fine dinner, My Lord.
372;00:26:10,964;00:26:12,899;Call me Tyrion, please.
373;00:26:12,933;00:26:14,768;I'm sure you're getting
373;00:26:12,933;00:26:14,768;used to fine dinners,
374;00:26:14,802;00:26:16,336;now that you're a lord.
375;00:26:16,371;00:26:18,238;Maybe I'll hire
375;00:26:16,371;00:26:18,238;this cook of yours.
376;00:26:18,273;00:26:20,274;Wars have been
376;00:26:18,273;00:26:20,274;started for less.
377;00:26:22,310;00:26:25,446;I heard there was some trouble in
377;00:26:22,310;00:26:25,446;Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
378;00:26:25,480;00:26:27,614;Mm, nasty business.
379;00:26:27,648;00:26:29,616;Had to be done.
379;00:26:27,648;00:26:29,616;Yes, of course.
380;00:26:29,650;00:26:31,884;The City Watch
380;00:26:29,650;00:26:31,884;must keep the peace,
381;00:26:31,918;00:26:35,787;only I hadn't realized
381;00:26:31,918;00:26:35,787;peace depended on killing babies.
382;00:26:35,822;00:26:39,357;Orders are orders.
382;00:26:35,822;00:26:39,357;Quite right.
383;00:26:39,391;00:26:41,459;Especially
383;00:26:39,391;00:26:41,459;the queen's orders.
384;00:26:41,493;00:26:43,261;I never said they were
384;00:26:41,493;00:26:43,261;the queen's orders.
385;00:26:43,295;00:26:47,799;No, but who else would want to
385;00:26:43,295;00:26:47,799;murder King Robert's bastards?
386;00:26:47,833;00:26:49,467;She's always been
386;00:26:47,833;00:26:49,467;a jealous woman.
387;00:26:49,501;00:26:51,502;You know your sister
387;00:26:49,501;00:26:51,502;better than I do.
388;00:26:51,537;00:26:53,571;You've heard the awful rumors
388;00:26:51,537;00:26:53,571;about my brother and sister?
389;00:26:53,606;00:26:55,240;I don't listen to filth.
390;00:26:55,274;00:26:58,543;That's good of you,
390;00:26:55,274;00:26:58,543;but you have heard them.
391;00:26:58,577;00:27:01,479;I suppose people who do believe
391;00:26:58,577;00:27:01,479;that filth consider Robert's bastards
392;00:27:01,513;00:27:04,181;to be better claimants to the throne
392;00:27:01,513;00:27:04,181;than Cersei's children.
393;00:27:04,216;00:27:06,284;Joffrey is my king.
393;00:27:04,216;00:27:06,284;The rest doesn't interest me.
394;00:27:06,318;00:27:08,486;I appreciate
394;00:27:06,318;00:27:08,486;your loyalty.
395;00:27:10,088;00:27:14,090;Tell me, when your men
395;00:27:10,088;00:27:14,090;slaughtered Ned Stark's men
396;00:27:14,125;00:27:17,960;in the throne room,
396;00:27:14,125;00:27:17,960;did you give the order?
397;00:27:17,995;00:27:19,962;I did.
398;00:27:19,996;00:27:21,697;And I would again.
399;00:27:21,731;00:27:23,532;The man was a traitor.
400;00:27:23,567;00:27:25,535;He tried to buy
400;00:27:23,567;00:27:25,535;my loyalty.
401;00:27:25,569;00:27:27,737;The fool.
402;00:27:27,772;00:27:29,906;He had no idea
402;00:27:27,772;00:27:29,906;you were already bought.
403;00:27:29,941;00:27:32,142;Are you drunk?
404;00:27:32,177;00:27:34,345;I'll not have my honor
404;00:27:32,177;00:27:34,345;questioned by an Imp!
405;00:27:34,380;00:27:38,483;I'm not questioning
405;00:27:34,380;00:27:38,483;Your Honor, Lord Janos.
406;00:27:38,517;00:27:40,186;I'm denying its existence.
407;00:27:40,220;00:27:43,322;If you think I'll stand here
407;00:27:40,220;00:27:43,322;and take this from you, dwarf--
408;00:27:43,389;00:27:46,091;Dwarf? Mm, you should
408;00:27:43,389;00:27:46,091;have stopped at Imp.
409;00:27:46,126;00:27:48,794;And, yes, you will stand here
409;00:27:46,126;00:27:48,794;and take it from me,
410;00:27:48,829;00:27:51,197;unless you'd like to take it
410;00:27:48,829;00:27:51,197;from my friend here.
411;00:27:52,399;00:27:54,233;I intend to serve
411;00:27:52,399;00:27:54,233;as Hand of the King
412;00:27:54,267;00:27:55,934;until my father
412;00:27:54,267;00:27:55,934;returns from the war.
413;00:27:56,002;00:27:58,069;And seeing as you betrayed
413;00:27:56,002;00:27:58,069;the last Hand of the King,
414;00:27:58,104;00:28:01,005;well, I just wouldn't
414;00:27:58,104;00:28:01,005;feel safe with you lurking about.
415;00:28:01,040;00:28:02,540;What are you t--
416;00:28:02,575;00:28:04,343;my friends at court
416;00:28:02,575;00:28:04,343;will not allow this!
417;00:28:04,377;00:28:06,478;The queen herself has granted--
417;00:28:04,377;00:28:06,478;The queen regent.
418;00:28:06,512;00:28:09,381;And you're a fool to believe
418;00:28:06,512;00:28:09,381;she is your friend.
419;00:28:09,416;00:28:11,751;We shall hear what Joffrey
419;00:28:09,416;00:28:11,751;has to say about this.
420;00:28:11,785;00:28:14,854;No, we shan't.
421;00:28:20,394;00:28:23,697;There's a ship leaving
421;00:28:20,394;00:28:23,697;for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea tonight.
422;00:28:23,731;00:28:27,366;From there I'm afraid it's rather
422;00:28:23,731;00:28:27,366;a long walk to Castle Black.
423;00:28:27,401;00:28:29,536;I hope you enjoy the Wall.
424;00:28:29,570;00:28:32,438;I found it
424;00:28:29,570;00:28:32,438;surprisingly beautiful...
425;00:28:32,473;00:28:36,409;In a brutal, horribly
425;00:28:32,473;00:28:36,409;uncomfortable sort of way.
426;00:28:36,443;00:28:37,977;The lads will escort you.
427;00:28:38,012;00:28:39,879;The streets aren't safe
427;00:28:38,012;00:28:39,879;at night, My Lord.
428;00:28:39,913;00:28:42,282;These men are
428;00:28:39,913;00:28:42,282;under my command!
429;00:28:42,316;00:28:44,484;I command you to arrest
429;00:28:42,316;00:28:44,484;this cutthroat.
430;00:28:44,518;00:28:46,353;His name is Bronn
431;00:28:46,387;00:28:48,688;and he is the new
431;00:28:46,387;00:28:48,688;commander of the City Watch.
432;00:28:48,722;00:28:50,356;Boys.
433;00:28:52,526;00:28:54,894;I have friends at court,
434;00:28:54,929;00:28:57,464;powerful friends!
435;00:28:57,498;00:29:00,066;The king himself
435;00:28:57,498;00:29:00,066;made me a lord!
436;00:29:05,006;00:29:07,274;To the new Commander.
437;00:29:13,315;00:29:17,351;If I told you to murder
437;00:29:13,315;00:29:17,351;an infant girl, say,
438;00:29:17,385;00:29:20,621;still at her
438;00:29:17,385;00:29:20,621;mother's breast,
439;00:29:20,656;00:29:23,590;would you do it
439;00:29:20,656;00:29:23,590;without question?
440;00:29:24,926;00:29:27,628;Without question? No.
441;00:29:27,662;00:29:29,963;I'd ask, how much?
442;00:29:47,283;00:29:49,717;If they come back,
442;00:29:47,283;00:29:49,717;I say we yield.
443;00:29:49,752;00:29:51,052;Gendry's the one
443;00:29:49,752;00:29:51,052;they want.
444;00:29:51,086;00:29:53,154;Don't want to get caught
444;00:29:51,086;00:29:53,154;in the middle of a battle.
445;00:29:53,188;00:29:54,788;I ain't afraid
445;00:29:53,188;00:29:54,788;of no battles.
446;00:29:54,822;00:29:57,457;If you got within a mile of a battle,
446;00:29:54,822;00:29:57,457;you'd fill your pants.
447;00:29:57,492;00:29:58,992;I've seen
447;00:29:57,492;00:29:58,992;lots of battles.
448;00:29:59,026;00:30:00,693;I saw--
448;00:29:59,026;00:30:00,693;Liar.
449;00:30:00,728;00:30:02,963;I saw a man
449;00:30:00,728;00:30:02,963;kill another man
450;00:30:02,997;00:30:05,365;just outside a tavern
450;00:30:02,997;00:30:05,365;in Flea Bottom.
451;00:30:05,400;00:30:07,801;Stabbed him
451;00:30:05,400;00:30:07,801;right in the neck.
452;00:30:07,836;00:30:10,637;Two men fighting
452;00:30:07,836;00:30:10,637;isn't a battle.
453;00:30:10,672;00:30:13,507;They had armor on.
453;00:30:10,672;00:30:13,507;So?
454;00:30:13,542;00:30:16,043;So, if they've got armor on,
454;00:30:13,542;00:30:16,043;it's a battle.
455;00:30:16,077;00:30:17,845;No, it isn't.
456;00:30:17,879;00:30:20,481;What does a dyer's apprentice
456;00:30:17,879;00:30:20,481;know about battles anyway?
457;00:30:20,515;00:30:22,783;Gendry's an armorer's
457;00:30:20,515;00:30:22,783;apprentice.
458;00:30:22,817;00:30:25,719;Hot pie, tell Gendry
458;00:30:22,817;00:30:25,719;what makes a fight into a battle.
459;00:30:27,555;00:30:30,057;It's, um, when
459;00:30:27,555;00:30:30,057;they've got armor on.
460;00:30:30,091;00:30:32,893;Who told you that?
461;00:30:32,927;00:30:34,361;A knight.
462;00:30:34,396;00:30:37,031;How'd you know
462;00:30:34,396;00:30:37,031;he was a knight?
463;00:30:38,333;00:30:41,702;Well, it was 'cause
463;00:30:38,333;00:30:41,702;he got armor on.
464;00:30:41,736;00:30:43,770;You don't have to be a knight
464;00:30:41,736;00:30:43,770;to have armor.
465;00:30:43,805;00:30:45,472;Any idiot
465;00:30:43,805;00:30:45,472;can buy armor.
466;00:30:45,507;00:30:47,241;How do you know?
467;00:30:47,275;00:30:49,376;'Cause I sold armor.
468;00:31:02,289;00:31:03,756;What do the Gold Cloaks
468;00:31:02,289;00:31:03,756;want with you?
469;00:31:03,790;00:31:06,626;No idea.
469;00:31:03,790;00:31:06,626;You're a liar.
470;00:31:06,660;00:31:08,961;You know, you shouldn't insult
470;00:31:06,660;00:31:08,961;people that are bigger than you.
471;00:31:08,996;00:31:11,631;Then I wouldn't get
471;00:31:08,996;00:31:11,631;to insult anyone.
472;00:31:11,665;00:31:14,033;I don't care
472;00:31:11,665;00:31:14,033;what any of them want.
473;00:31:14,067;00:31:15,802;No good's ever come
473;00:31:14,067;00:31:15,802;of their questions.
474;00:31:15,836;00:31:18,037;No good's ever come?
475;00:31:18,072;00:31:20,073;Who asked questions
475;00:31:18,072;00:31:20,073;before?
476;00:31:20,107;00:31:23,409;How can someone so small be such
476;00:31:20,107;00:31:23,409;a huge pain in my ass?
477;00:31:23,443;00:31:25,511;Who asked questions?
478;00:31:27,614;00:31:29,081;The Hand of the King.
479;00:31:29,115;00:31:31,317;Hands of the King.
480;00:31:31,351;00:31:34,520;Lord Arryn came first
480;00:31:31,351;00:31:34,520;a few weeks before he died,
481;00:31:34,554;00:31:39,091;and then Lord Stark came
481;00:31:34,554;00:31:39,091;a few weeks before he died.
482;00:31:39,125;00:31:41,060;Lord Stark?
483;00:31:41,094;00:31:45,364;See? Asking me
483;00:31:41,094;00:31:45,364;questions is bad luck.
484;00:31:46,399;00:31:49,300;You'll probably
484;00:31:46,399;00:31:49,300;be dead soon.
485;00:31:49,334;00:31:52,603;What did they ask about?
485;00:31:49,334;00:31:52,603;My mom.
486;00:31:52,637;00:31:55,306;Who's your mom?
486;00:31:52,637;00:31:55,306;Just my mom--
487;00:31:55,340;00:31:57,375;worked in a tavern,
487;00:31:55,340;00:31:57,375;died when I was little.
488;00:31:57,409;00:31:58,876;And who was your father?
489;00:31:58,911;00:32:02,279;Could've been one of those
489;00:31:58,911;00:32:02,279;gold-hatted bastards, for all I know.
490;00:32:02,313;00:32:04,414;What about you anyway?
491;00:32:04,448;00:32:07,550;You thought
491;00:32:04,448;00:32:07,550;they were after you.
492;00:32:07,585;00:32:09,385;Why?
493;00:32:09,420;00:32:11,954;Did you kill someone or is it
493;00:32:09,420;00:32:11,954;just because you're a girl?
494;00:32:13,123;00:32:15,257;I'm not a girl.
494;00:32:13,123;00:32:15,257;Yes, you are.
495;00:32:15,292;00:32:16,582;Do you think I'm as stupid
495;00:32:15,292;00:32:16,582;as the rest of them?
496;00:32:16,607;00:32:17,807;Stupider.
497;00:32:18,128;00:32:19,583;The Night's Watch doesn't take girls,
497;00:32:18,128;00:32:19,583;everyone knows that.
498;00:32:19,584;00:32:21,121;Yeah, that's true,
498;00:32:19,584;00:32:21,121;but you're still a girl.
499;00:32:21,146;00:32:22,346;I am not!
500;00:32:22,700;00:32:24,901;Yeah? Well, pull your cock out
500;00:32:22,700;00:32:24,901;and take a piss, then.
501;00:32:26,404;00:32:28,238;I don't need
501;00:32:26,404;00:32:28,238;to take a piss.
502;00:32:34,446;00:32:36,514;Lommy and hot pie
502;00:32:34,446;00:32:36,514;can't know.
503;00:32:36,549;00:32:37,982;No one can know.
504;00:32:38,017;00:32:41,920;Well, they won't,
504;00:32:38,017;00:32:41,920;not from me.
505;00:32:44,556;00:32:47,091;My name's not Arry.
506;00:32:47,125;00:32:49,893;It's Arya...
506;00:32:47,125;00:32:49,893;of House Stark.
507;00:32:51,962;00:32:55,164;Yoren is taking me home
507;00:32:51,962;00:32:55,164;to Winterfell.
508;00:32:55,198;00:32:58,467;He was your father--
508;00:32:55,198;00:32:58,467;the Hand, the traitor.
509;00:32:58,501;00:33:00,535;He was never a traitor.
510;00:33:00,569;00:33:02,603;Joffrey is a liar.
511;00:33:02,671;00:33:04,972;So you're a highborn, then.
511;00:33:02,671;00:33:04,972;You're a lady.
512;00:33:05,007;00:33:06,974;No. I mean, yes.
513;00:33:07,009;00:33:08,443;My mother was a lady
513;00:33:07,009;00:33:08,443;and my sister--
514;00:33:08,477;00:33:09,944;Yeah, but you were
514;00:33:08,477;00:33:09,944;a lord's daughter
515;00:33:09,978;00:33:12,046;and you lived
515;00:33:09,978;00:33:12,046;in a castle and you--
516;00:33:12,081;00:33:14,783;look, all that about cocks,
516;00:33:12,081;00:33:14,783;I should never have said--
517;00:33:14,817;00:33:17,085;and I've been pissing
517;00:33:14,817;00:33:17,085;in front of you and everything.
518;00:33:17,119;00:33:19,921;I-- I should be
518;00:33:17,119;00:33:19,921;calling you My Lady.
519;00:33:19,955;00:33:22,924;Do not call me My Lady.
519;00:33:19,955;00:33:22,924;As My Lady commands.
520;00:33:22,959;00:33:24,893;Well, that was unladylike.
521;00:33:24,927;00:33:27,196;Oh!
522;00:33:54,157;00:33:56,125;What's she carrying?
523;00:33:57,260;00:33:58,861;Myrish oranges,
524;00:33:58,895;00:34:01,931;wine from the Arbor...
525;00:34:01,965;00:34:05,401;And the heir to Pyke
525;00:34:01,965;00:34:05,401;and the Iron Islands.
526;00:34:07,837;00:34:10,839;The only living son
526;00:34:07,837;00:34:10,839;of Balon Greyjoy.
527;00:34:13,910;00:34:16,077;Me.
528;00:34:17,246;00:34:19,680;I don't like wine.
529;00:34:19,715;00:34:21,816;Woman's drink.
530;00:34:24,386;00:34:26,188;I need to get to Pyke.
531;00:34:36,133;00:34:38,100;I'll find you a horse.
532;00:34:48,613;00:34:51,982;I'm heading that way.
532;00:34:48,613;00:34:51,982;I can take you there.
533;00:34:52,017;00:34:54,685;I bet you can.
534;00:34:54,719;00:34:56,553;Have you been
534;00:34:54,719;00:34:56,553;at sea long?
535;00:34:56,588;00:34:59,123;Or were there just no women
535;00:34:56,588;00:34:59,123;where you came from?
536;00:34:59,157;00:35:01,559;None like you.
536;00:34:59,157;00:35:01,559;You don't know what I'm like.
537;00:35:01,593;00:35:04,261;Maybe you don't know
537;00:35:01,593;00:35:04,261;what you're like.
538;00:35:04,296;00:35:07,331;Maybe you need
538;00:35:04,296;00:35:07,331;someone to teach you.
539;00:35:07,366;00:35:09,500;Do you know who I am?
540;00:35:09,535;00:35:12,771;You think I offer free rides
540;00:35:09,535;00:35:12,771;to every man in jewelry,
541;00:35:12,805;00:35:16,074;Lord Greyjoy?
542;00:35:18,111;00:35:20,512;Have my things sent up
542;00:35:18,111;00:35:20,512;to the castle.
543;00:35:37,497;00:35:39,398;You should give me
543;00:35:37,497;00:35:39,398;the reins.
544;00:35:39,432;00:35:41,300;I'm a better rider
544;00:35:39,432;00:35:41,300;than you.
545;00:35:41,334;00:35:43,435;I've been on horseback
545;00:35:41,334;00:35:43,435;for the past nine years.
546;00:35:43,469;00:35:44,937;Nine years?
547;00:35:44,971;00:35:47,439;Do you still know
547;00:35:44,971;00:35:47,439;your way around a ship?
548;00:35:47,473;00:35:49,508;Have these hands
548;00:35:47,473;00:35:49,508;ever touched a rope?
549;00:35:49,542;00:35:52,010;Don't you worry
549;00:35:49,542;00:35:52,010;about my hands.
550;00:35:53,846;00:35:55,947;The sea is in my blood.
551;00:35:55,982;00:35:59,284;Your blood will be in the sea
551;00:35:55,982;00:35:59,284;if I don't watch where I'm going.
552;00:35:59,318;00:36:02,487;I have a proposal
552;00:35:59,318;00:36:02,487;for my father,
553;00:36:02,522;00:36:05,191;one that will
553;00:36:02,522;00:36:05,191;make him king again,
554;00:36:05,225;00:36:07,293;and me after him.
555;00:36:09,062;00:36:11,998;You may get to stay
555;00:36:09,062;00:36:11,998;in a castle tonight if you're lucky.
556;00:36:12,032;00:36:14,167;Is that an offer
556;00:36:12,032;00:36:14,167;from my future king?
557;00:36:14,202;00:36:16,770;An order from
557;00:36:14,202;00:36:16,770;your future king.
558;00:36:18,973;00:36:21,675;You can tell your grandchildren
558;00:36:18,973;00:36:21,675;about this night.
559;00:36:21,709;00:36:24,844;I don't imagine it will be
559;00:36:21,709;00:36:24,844;a story fit for children.
560;00:36:38,057;00:36:40,191;Father.
561;00:36:40,226;00:36:43,394;Nine years, is it?
562;00:36:43,429;00:36:45,430;They took
562;00:36:43,429;00:36:45,430;a frightened boy.
563;00:36:45,464;00:36:48,300;What have
563;00:36:45,464;00:36:48,300;they given back?
564;00:36:49,736;00:36:51,737;A man.
565;00:36:51,772;00:36:55,175;Your blood and your heir.
565;00:36:51,772;00:36:55,175;We shall see.
566;00:36:56,344;00:36:59,247;Stark had you
566;00:36:56,344;00:36:59,247;longer than I did.
567;00:36:59,281;00:37:01,449;Lord Stark is gone.
568;00:37:02,785;00:37:06,254;And how do you feel
568;00:37:02,785;00:37:06,254;about that?
569;00:37:09,025;00:37:11,593;What's done is done.
570;00:37:11,627;00:37:13,662;I've brought you
570;00:37:11,627;00:37:13,662;a proposal from Robb Stark.
571;00:37:13,696;00:37:16,831;Who gave you
571;00:37:13,696;00:37:16,831;those clothes?
572;00:37:16,865;00:37:20,335;Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
572;00:37:16,865;00:37:20,335;to make you his daughter?
573;00:37:20,369;00:37:23,304;If my clothes offend you,
573;00:37:20,369;00:37:23,304;I will change them.
574;00:37:23,339;00:37:25,006;You will.
575;00:37:26,075;00:37:28,577;That bauble
575;00:37:26,075;00:37:28,577;'round your neck--
576;00:37:28,611;00:37:31,747;did you pay the iron price
576;00:37:28,611;00:37:31,747;for it or the gold?
577;00:37:32,949;00:37:34,550;I asked a question.
578;00:37:34,584;00:37:37,220;Did you pull it from the neck
578;00:37:34,584;00:37:37,220;of a corpse you made
579;00:37:37,254;00:37:41,858;or did you buy it
579;00:37:37,254;00:37:41,858;to match your fine clothes?
580;00:37:43,661;00:37:46,962;Iron or gold?
581;00:37:49,199;00:37:51,333;Gold.
582;00:37:54,704;00:37:58,007;I'll not have my son
582;00:37:54,704;00:37:58,007;dressed as a whore.
583;00:38:01,010;00:38:03,478;My fears have come true--
584;00:38:03,513;00:38:05,747;the Starks
584;00:38:03,513;00:38:05,747;have made you theirs.
585;00:38:05,782;00:38:09,052;My blood is salt and iron.
585;00:38:05,782;00:38:09,052;Yet the Stark boy sends you to me
586;00:38:09,086;00:38:12,355;like a trained raven
586;00:38:09,086;00:38:12,355;clutching his message.
587;00:38:12,423;00:38:14,357;The offer he makes
587;00:38:12,423;00:38:14,357;is one I proposed.
588;00:38:14,392;00:38:16,960;He heeds your counsel?
588;00:38:14,392;00:38:16,960;I've lived with him,
589;00:38:16,995;00:38:18,562;hunted with him,
589;00:38:16,995;00:38:18,562;fought at his side.
590;00:38:18,630;00:38:20,231;He thinks of me
590;00:38:18,630;00:38:20,231;as a brother.
591;00:38:20,265;00:38:22,901;No, not here,
591;00:38:20,265;00:38:22,901;not in my hearing.
592;00:38:22,935;00:38:25,436;You will not
592;00:38:22,935;00:38:25,436;name him brother,
593;00:38:25,471;00:38:29,407;this son of the man who put
593;00:38:25,471;00:38:29,407;your true brothers to the sword.
594;00:38:29,442;00:38:32,277;Or have you forgotten
594;00:38:29,442;00:38:32,277;your own blood?
595;00:38:32,311;00:38:34,279;I forget nothing.
596;00:38:34,313;00:38:37,182;I remember my brothers.
597;00:38:37,217;00:38:40,152;And I remember
597;00:38:37,217;00:38:40,152;when my father was a king.
598;00:38:56,237;00:38:58,238;I see.
599;00:38:58,273;00:39:00,874;I destroy Robb Stark's
599;00:38:58,273;00:39:00,874;enemies for him
600;00:39:00,908;00:39:04,311;and he will make me
600;00:39:00,908;00:39:04,311;king of the Iron Islands once again.
601;00:39:04,345;00:39:08,147;I will lead the attack myself.
601;00:39:04,345;00:39:08,147;Oh, you will?
602;00:39:08,182;00:39:10,783;I'm your son,
602;00:39:08,182;00:39:10,783;your only living heir.
603;00:39:10,817;00:39:13,252;Who else?
604;00:39:15,288;00:39:17,389;I told you to wait outside.
605;00:39:18,725;00:39:20,826;How did you get
605;00:39:18,725;00:39:20,826;past the guards?
606;00:39:20,860;00:39:23,261;Anything with a cock
606;00:39:20,860;00:39:23,261;is easy to fool.
607;00:39:23,296;00:39:26,065;My dear.
608;00:39:29,202;00:39:30,836;Yara?
609;00:39:30,871;00:39:33,739;So good to see you,
609;00:39:30,871;00:39:33,739;brother.
610;00:39:33,773;00:39:37,409;This is a homecoming I'll tell
610;00:39:33,773;00:39:37,409;my grandchildren about.
611;00:39:39,913;00:39:41,347;She can't lead an attack!
612;00:39:41,381;00:39:44,617;And why not?
612;00:39:41,381;00:39:44,617;You're a woman!
613;00:39:44,651;00:39:48,087;You're the one in skirts.
613;00:39:44,651;00:39:48,087;This isn't Winterfell, boy.
614;00:39:48,122;00:39:50,623;Your sister took over command
614;00:39:48,122;00:39:50,623;of your eldest brother's ship
615;00:39:50,658;00:39:53,526;after your new father
615;00:39:50,658;00:39:53,526;killed him.
616;00:39:53,561;00:39:57,263;What's dead may never die.
617;00:39:57,298;00:39:59,299;The only nights she's spent
617;00:39:57,298;00:39:59,299;off these islands
618;00:39:59,333;00:40:01,334;have been spent
618;00:39:59,333;00:40:01,334;on the sea.
619;00:40:02,369;00:40:04,370;She's commanded men.
620;00:40:04,404;00:40:06,439;She's killed men.
621;00:40:06,473;00:40:08,608;She knows who she is.
622;00:40:11,245;00:40:13,713;No man gives me
622;00:40:11,245;00:40:13,713;a crown.
623;00:40:13,747;00:40:16,950;I pay the iron price.
624;00:40:16,984;00:40:18,918;I will take my crown,
625;00:40:18,953;00:40:22,222;for that is who I am.
626;00:40:22,256;00:40:24,691;That is who
626;00:40:22,256;00:40:24,691;we have always been.
627;00:40:29,331;00:40:31,399;You won't stand a chance against
627;00:40:29,331;00:40:31,399;the Lannisters on your own.
628;00:40:31,433;00:40:34,302;Who said anything
628;00:40:31,433;00:40:34,302;about the Lannisters?
629;00:40:41,912;00:40:43,380;You'll have your gold
630;00:40:43,414;00:40:45,048;when we take the treasury
630;00:40:43,414;00:40:45,048;at King's Landing.
631;00:40:45,082;00:40:46,850;All these kings
631;00:40:45,082;00:40:46,850;fighting for the throne,
632;00:40:46,884;00:40:49,820;and this Stannis
632;00:40:46,884;00:40:49,820;has the smallest army.
633;00:40:49,854;00:40:51,821;Why would I bet on the man
633;00:40:49,854;00:40:51,821;with the worst chance?
634;00:40:51,856;00:40:55,158;Because you're
634;00:40:51,856;00:40:55,158;a smart gambler.
635;00:40:55,193;00:40:58,161;Stannis has proved
635;00:40:55,193;00:40:58,161;himself in war twice.
636;00:40:58,195;00:41:01,464;His baby brother has never set foot
636;00:40:58,195;00:41:01,464;on a battlefield.
637;00:41:01,499;00:41:03,266;Neither has
637;00:41:01,499;00:41:03,266;the false King Joffrey.
638;00:41:03,301;00:41:05,268;And yet they both
638;00:41:03,301;00:41:05,268;have larger armies.
639;00:41:05,302;00:41:07,270;Stannis has just
639;00:41:05,302;00:41:07,270;begun the fight.
640;00:41:07,304;00:41:10,906;His Bannermen
640;00:41:07,304;00:41:10,906;will rally to his cause.
641;00:41:10,941;00:41:13,642;There's no man
641;00:41:10,941;00:41:13,642;in the Seven Kingdoms
642;00:41:13,676;00:41:15,244;more honorable
642;00:41:13,676;00:41:15,244;than Stannis Baratheon
643;00:41:15,278;00:41:16,678;or more worthy
643;00:41:15,278;00:41:16,678;of loyalty.
644;00:41:16,713;00:41:18,279;What is the world
644;00:41:16,713;00:41:18,279;coming to
645;00:41:18,314;00:41:20,915;when smugglers must vouch
645;00:41:18,314;00:41:20,915;for the honor of kings?
646;00:41:20,949;00:41:23,351;Mind your words, pirate.
646;00:41:20,949;00:41:23,351;Matthos.
647;00:41:23,385;00:41:24,919;You think I'm insulted?
648;00:41:24,954;00:41:27,955;I am a pirate.
648;00:41:24,954;00:41:27,955;I'm an excellent pirate.
649;00:41:27,990;00:41:30,625;I don't sail
649;00:41:27,990;00:41:30,625;for promises.
650;00:41:30,659;00:41:32,059;Of course you do.
651;00:41:32,094;00:41:34,762;Every time you leave harbor,
651;00:41:32,094;00:41:34,762;you're leaving on a promise--
652;00:41:34,796;00:41:36,263;a promise that
652;00:41:34,796;00:41:36,263;somewhere on the sea,
653;00:41:36,298;00:41:38,699;somebody's got some gold
653;00:41:36,298;00:41:38,699;and you can take it from him.
654;00:41:38,734;00:41:41,502;That's a promise that always comes true.
654;00:41:38,734;00:41:41,502;As is mine.
655;00:41:41,537;00:41:43,772;You're not a young man,
655;00:41:41,537;00:41:43,772;Salladhor.
656;00:41:43,806;00:41:45,607;And correct me
656;00:41:43,806;00:41:45,607;if I'm wrong--
657;00:41:45,641;00:41:47,342;most pirates
657;00:41:45,641;00:41:47,342;don't grow old.
658;00:41:47,377;00:41:49,478;Only the clever ones.
659;00:41:49,512;00:41:52,414;You want to spend
659;00:41:49,512;00:41:52,414;your last few years on the sea
660;00:41:52,448;00:41:54,549;stealing from
660;00:41:52,448;00:41:54,549;Pentoshi cheesemongers
661;00:41:54,584;00:41:55,918;and Meereenese
661;00:41:54,584;00:41:55,918;silk merchants?
662;00:41:55,952;00:41:58,019;Then go.
662;00:41:55,952;00:41:58,019;They're out there waiting for you.
663;00:41:58,054;00:41:59,755;That's easy.
664;00:41:59,789;00:42:02,324;What I'm offering you
664;00:41:59,789;00:42:02,324;is hard.
665;00:42:04,060;00:42:07,896;Come with me and plunder
665;00:42:04,060;00:42:07,896;the greatest city in Westeros.
666;00:42:07,930;00:42:10,632;You'll be the richest man
666;00:42:07,930;00:42:10,632;in Lys and the most famous.
667;00:42:10,666;00:42:14,536;They'll be singing songs about you
667;00:42:10,666;00:42:14,536;as long as men have voices to sing.
668;00:42:16,206;00:42:18,473;Salladhor Saan
668;00:42:16,206;00:42:18,473;is a good name for songs.
669;00:42:18,508;00:42:22,076;It is.
669;00:42:18,508;00:42:22,076;One thing-- I want the queen.
670;00:42:22,111;00:42:24,912;The queen?
670;00:42:22,111;00:42:24,912;Cersei-- I want her.
671;00:42:24,947;00:42:27,414;I'll sail with your fleet,
671;00:42:24,947;00:42:27,414;all 30 of my ships.
672;00:42:27,449;00:42:29,750;And if we don't drown at the bottom
672;00:42:27,449;00:42:29,750;of Blackwater Bay,
673;00:42:29,784;00:42:33,053;I will fuck this blonde queen
673;00:42:29,784;00:42:33,053;and I'll fuck her well.
674;00:42:33,088;00:42:34,922;This war
674;00:42:33,088;00:42:34,922;isn't about you.
675;00:42:34,956;00:42:38,258;We're not attacking King's Landing
675;00:42:34,956;00:42:38,258;so that you can rape the queen.
676;00:42:38,293;00:42:41,094;I'm not going to rape her.
676;00:42:38,293;00:42:41,094;I'm going to fuck her.
677;00:42:41,129;00:42:43,263;As if she would
677;00:42:41,129;00:42:43,263;just let you.
678;00:42:43,297;00:42:44,964;You don't know
678;00:42:43,297;00:42:44,964;how persuasive I am.
679;00:42:44,999;00:42:47,266;I've never tried
679;00:42:44,999;00:42:47,266;to fuck you.
680;00:42:48,969;00:42:52,605;Stannis is the rightful king
680;00:42:48,969;00:42:52,605;and the Lord of Light,
681;00:42:52,639;00:42:54,006;the one true God--
682;00:42:54,040;00:42:55,607;I've been all over
682;00:42:54,040;00:42:55,607;the world, my boy,
683;00:42:55,642;00:42:58,310;and everywhere I go,
683;00:42:55,642;00:42:58,310;people tell me about the true Gods.
684;00:42:58,344;00:43:00,512;They all think
684;00:42:58,344;00:43:00,512;they found the right one.
685;00:43:00,546;00:43:03,849;The one true God
685;00:43:00,546;00:43:03,849;is what's between a woman's legs,
686;00:43:03,883;00:43:06,452;and better yet,
686;00:43:03,883;00:43:06,452;a queen's legs.
687;00:43:07,955;00:43:10,056;I never thought you'd have
687;00:43:07,955;00:43:10,056;a true believer for a son.
688;00:43:10,091;00:43:11,791;Eh, he's young yet.
689;00:43:13,094;00:43:15,829;I promise you the gold.
689;00:43:13,094;00:43:15,829;I promise you the glory.
690;00:43:15,864;00:43:17,598;I cannot promise you
690;00:43:15,864;00:43:17,598;the queen.
691;00:43:20,936;00:43:22,803;You believe
691;00:43:20,936;00:43:22,803;your king can win?
692;00:43:22,837;00:43:25,038;He is the one true king.
693;00:43:25,072;00:43:26,873;You Westerosi
693;00:43:25,072;00:43:26,873;are funny people.
694;00:43:26,907;00:43:29,275;A man chops off your fingers
694;00:43:26,907;00:43:29,275;and you fall in love with him.
695;00:43:32,079;00:43:34,647;I'll sail with you,
695;00:43:32,079;00:43:34,647;Davos Seaworth.
696;00:43:34,681;00:43:38,284;You're the most honest
696;00:43:34,681;00:43:38,284;smuggler I ever met.
697;00:43:38,318;00:43:40,519;Make me rich.
698;00:43:40,553;00:43:43,956;Get me to the gates
698;00:43:40,553;00:43:43,956;of King's Landing and I will.
699;00:43:55,770;00:43:57,404;When will the king
699;00:43:55,770;00:43:57,404;have us sail?
700;00:43:57,438;00:43:59,773;As soon as his God
700;00:43:57,438;00:43:59,773;wills it.
701;00:43:59,841;00:44:02,443;He's my God, too,
701;00:43:59,841;00:44:02,443;and yours,
702;00:44:02,510;00:44:05,146;but you are
702;00:44:02,510;00:44:05,146;too blind to see.
703;00:44:07,249;00:44:09,283;Let me teach you how to read.
703;00:44:07,249;00:44:09,283;Oh, you and your mother.
704;00:44:09,317;00:44:10,984;It won't take long.
704;00:44:09,317;00:44:10,984;You already know the letters.
705;00:44:11,019;00:44:13,219;The holy books are much more
705;00:44:11,019;00:44:13,219;persuasive than I can be.
706;00:44:13,254;00:44:15,021;I wish I had
706;00:44:13,254;00:44:15,021;a God, truly.
707;00:44:15,056;00:44:17,724;I'm not mocking you, but I've seen
707;00:44:15,056;00:44:17,724;men pray to every God there is--
708;00:44:17,758;00:44:20,159;pray for wind, pray for rain,
708;00:44:17,758;00:44:20,159;pray for home.
709;00:44:20,194;00:44:22,962;None of it works.
709;00:44:20,194;00:44:22,962;But you always came home.
710;00:44:22,996;00:44:26,933;I wasn't praying.
710;00:44:22,996;00:44:26,933;No, but I was.
711;00:44:28,402;00:44:30,069;Every night
711;00:44:28,402;00:44:30,069;that you were at sea,
712;00:44:30,103;00:44:33,206;I lit a candle
712;00:44:30,103;00:44:33,206;and I prayed for you.
713;00:44:34,341;00:44:35,941;You want me
713;00:44:34,341;00:44:35,941;to have a God?
714;00:44:35,975;00:44:39,111;Fine. King Stannis
714;00:44:35,975;00:44:39,111;is my God.
715;00:44:39,145;00:44:41,613;He raised me up
715;00:44:39,145;00:44:41,613;and blessed me with his trust.
716;00:44:41,648;00:44:44,216;He gave you a future
716;00:44:41,648;00:44:44,216;I could never have imagined.
717;00:44:44,251;00:44:46,252;You know how to read.
717;00:44:44,251;00:44:46,252;You'll be a knight someday.
718;00:44:46,286;00:44:49,555;You think a fire God
718;00:44:46,286;00:44:49,555;commanded all that?
719;00:44:49,589;00:44:52,991;It was Stannis,
719;00:44:49,589;00:44:52,991;only Stannis.
720;00:44:53,026;00:44:55,894;Stannis is my king,
720;00:44:53,026;00:44:55,894;but he's only a man.
721;00:44:55,928;00:44:58,896;Don't tell him that.
722;00:45:00,733;00:45:02,867;Lord Janos Slynt was
722;00:45:00,733;00:45:02,867;commander of the City Watch.
723;00:45:02,901;00:45:04,302;You had no right
723;00:45:02,901;00:45:04,302;to exile him.
724;00:45:04,336;00:45:06,037;I have every right.
724;00:45:04,336;00:45:06,037;I am the King's Hand.
725;00:45:06,071;00:45:08,606;You're serving as the King's Hand
725;00:45:06,071;00:45:08,606;till father gets here.
726;00:45:08,641;00:45:10,208;I am Queen Regent.
727;00:45:10,243;00:45:11,910;Listen to me,
727;00:45:10,243;00:45:11,910;Queen Regent.
728;00:45:11,945;00:45:14,346;You're losing the people.
729;00:45:14,381;00:45:16,483;Do you hear me?
729;00:45:14,381;00:45:16,483;The people.
730;00:45:16,517;00:45:18,285;You think I care?
731;00:45:18,319;00:45:19,987;You might
731;00:45:18,319;00:45:19,987;find it difficult
732;00:45:20,021;00:45:22,890;to rule over millions
732;00:45:20,021;00:45:22,890;who want you dead.
733;00:45:22,924;00:45:24,791;Half the city will starve
733;00:45:22,924;00:45:24,791;when winter comes.
734;00:45:24,826;00:45:26,360;The other half will plot
734;00:45:24,826;00:45:26,360;to overthrow you.
735;00:45:26,394;00:45:29,396;And your gold-plated thugs
735;00:45:26,394;00:45:29,396;just gave them
736;00:45:29,431;00:45:31,232;their rallying cry--
737;00:45:31,266;00:45:33,868;The Queen
737;00:45:31,266;00:45:33,868;slaughters babies.
738;00:45:35,804;00:45:39,440;You don't even have
738;00:45:35,804;00:45:39,440;the decency to deny it.
739;00:45:49,017;00:45:52,520;It wasn't you who gave
739;00:45:49,017;00:45:52,520;the order, was it?
740;00:45:52,555;00:45:54,422;Joffrey didn't
740;00:45:52,555;00:45:54,422;even tell you.
741;00:45:57,160;00:45:58,794;Did he tell you?
742;00:45:58,829;00:46:00,163;I imagine that
742;00:45:58,829;00:46:00,163;would be even worse.
743;00:46:00,197;00:46:03,133;He did what needed
743;00:46:00,197;00:46:03,133;to be done.
744;00:46:03,167;00:46:06,203;You want to be Hand of the King?
744;00:46:03,167;00:46:06,203;You want to rule?
745;00:46:06,237;00:46:09,105;This is what ruling is--
745;00:46:06,237;00:46:09,105;lying on a bed of weeds,
746;00:46:09,140;00:46:11,574;ripping them out
746;00:46:09,140;00:46:11,574;by the root, one by one,
747;00:46:11,608;00:46:13,175;before they strangle you
747;00:46:11,608;00:46:13,175;in your sleep.
748;00:46:13,210;00:46:15,744;I'm no king, but I think there's more
748;00:46:13,210;00:46:15,744;to ruling than that.
749;00:46:15,778;00:46:17,779;I don't care
749;00:46:15,778;00:46:17,779;what you think!
750;00:46:17,814;00:46:19,381;You've never
750;00:46:17,814;00:46:19,381;taken it seriously.
751;00:46:19,415;00:46:21,749;You haven't,
751;00:46:19,415;00:46:21,749;Jaime hasn't.
752;00:46:25,254;00:46:27,288;It's all fallen on me.
753;00:46:31,294;00:46:35,130;As has Jaime repeatedly,
753;00:46:31,294;00:46:35,130;according to Stannis Baratheon.
754;00:46:40,036;00:46:42,471;You're funny.
755;00:46:44,774;00:46:48,344;You've always
755;00:46:44,774;00:46:48,344;been funny...
756;00:46:48,378;00:46:50,313;But none of your jokes
756;00:46:48,378;00:46:50,313;will ever match
757;00:46:50,347;00:46:52,548;the first one, will they?
758;00:46:53,751;00:46:56,452;You remember?
759;00:46:56,487;00:46:58,188;Back when you ripped
759;00:46:56,487;00:46:58,188;my mother open
760;00:46:58,222;00:47:00,923;on your way out of her
760;00:46:58,222;00:47:00,923;and she bled to death?
761;00:47:02,426;00:47:05,094;She was my mother, too.
762;00:47:05,128;00:47:07,196;Mother gone...
763;00:47:08,799;00:47:11,100;For the sake of you.
764;00:47:13,603;00:47:17,106;There's no bigger joke
764;00:47:13,603;00:47:17,106;in the world than that.
765;00:47:38,429;00:47:41,465;Your Grace.
765;00:47:38,429;00:47:41,465;Your Grace.
766;00:47:41,499;00:47:43,633;How did you fare
766;00:47:41,499;00:47:43,633;with your pirate?
767;00:47:43,668;00:47:47,104;Salladhor Saan will join
767;00:47:43,668;00:47:47,104;our fleet-- 30 ships.
768;00:47:47,138;00:47:49,139;His men know
768;00:47:47,138;00:47:49,139;how to fight.
769;00:47:49,174;00:47:52,576;In my experience, pirates
769;00:47:49,174;00:47:52,576;prefer fighting unarmed men.
770;00:47:52,611;00:47:54,245;It does seem
770;00:47:52,611;00:47:54,245;the wiser choice.
771;00:47:54,279;00:47:56,714;There won't be
771;00:47:54,279;00:47:56,714;a choice this time.
772;00:47:57,916;00:47:59,651;Do you trust him?
773;00:47:59,685;00:48:01,386;Salladhor Saan
773;00:47:59,685;00:48:01,386;is an old friend.
774;00:48:01,420;00:48:03,388;I've known him 30 years.
775;00:48:03,422;00:48:05,690;I've never trusted him,
776;00:48:05,725;00:48:09,828;but once he gets the smell of gold,
776;00:48:05,725;00:48:09,828;he never stops.
777;00:48:09,862;00:48:13,098;Well, if he does his job,
777;00:48:09,862;00:48:13,098;he'll have his share.
778;00:48:16,269;00:48:17,870;Leave us.
779;00:48:24,011;00:48:25,612;At once, Your Grace.
780;00:48:32,520;00:48:35,822;The Lord of Light shines
780;00:48:32,520;00:48:35,822;through you, young warrior.
781;00:48:41,495;00:48:43,129;Come.
782;00:48:49,969;00:48:51,470;What did you say to him?
783;00:48:51,504;00:48:54,940;I told him death by fire
783;00:48:51,504;00:48:54,940;is the purest death.
784;00:48:54,974;00:48:58,177;Why?
784;00:48:54,974;00:48:58,177;Because it is true.
785;00:48:59,145;00:49:00,979;You're troubled, my king.
786;00:49:01,014;00:49:03,181;Yeah.
787;00:49:03,216;00:49:05,851;These armies are toys
787;00:49:03,216;00:49:05,851;for the Lord of Light.
788;00:49:05,885;00:49:08,854;Tell your lord
788;00:49:05,885;00:49:08,854;to burn them, then.
789;00:49:08,888;00:49:10,322;I tell him nothing.
790;00:49:10,356;00:49:13,559;I pray for his commands
790;00:49:10,356;00:49:13,559;and I obey.
791;00:49:15,328;00:49:19,231;My little brother has 100,000
791;00:49:15,328;00:49:19,231;men according to the scouts,
792;00:49:19,266;00:49:22,468;men whose allegiance
792;00:49:19,266;00:49:22,468;rightly belongs to me.
793;00:49:22,502;00:49:24,403;You must have faith.
794;00:49:24,438;00:49:26,472;Faith?
795;00:49:26,507;00:49:30,042;In a real war, the side
795;00:49:26,507;00:49:30,042;with the greater number wins
796;00:49:30,077;00:49:32,011;nine times out of 10.
797;00:49:32,045;00:49:33,679;Then we must be
797;00:49:32,045;00:49:33,679;the 10th.
798;00:49:33,714;00:49:38,051;I cannot defeat
798;00:49:33,714;00:49:38,051;my brother in the field.
799;00:49:38,085;00:49:41,555;And I can't take King's Landing
799;00:49:38,085;00:49:41,555;without the men he's stolen.
800;00:49:43,058;00:49:46,727;I have seen the path
800;00:49:43,058;00:49:46,727;to victory in the flames.
801;00:49:48,229;00:49:51,598;But first, you must give yourself
801;00:49:48,229;00:49:51,598;to the Lord of Light.
802;00:49:51,632;00:49:54,968;I've said the words,
802;00:49:51,632;00:49:54,968;damn you.
803;00:49:58,072;00:50:00,340;I burnt the idols.
804;00:50:03,644;00:50:07,614;You must give
804;00:50:03,644;00:50:07,614;all of yourself.
805;00:50:12,119;00:50:14,120;I have a wife.
806;00:50:15,356;00:50:17,324;I took a vow.
807;00:50:18,492;00:50:22,862;She's sickly, weak...
808;00:50:24,398;00:50:27,500;Shut away in a tower.
809;00:50:27,535;00:50:29,636;She disgusts you.
810;00:50:32,640;00:50:35,675;And she's given
810;00:50:32,640;00:50:35,675;you nothing--
811;00:50:35,743;00:50:40,447;no sons,

812;00:50:40,481;00:50:42,649;only death.
813;00:50:48,622;00:50:53,092;I will give you
813;00:50:48,622;00:50:53,092;a son, my king.
814;00:50:55,429;00:50:57,530;A son?
