46;00:10:02,147;00:10:04,315;We killed his friends.
47;00:10:04,350;00:10:06,151;Thought you'd want
47;00:10:04,350;00:10:06,151;to question this one.

53;00:10:28,542;00:10:32,211;My father told me big men fall
53;00:10:28,542;00:10:32,211;just as quick as little ones
54;00:10:32,246;00:10:35,715;if you put a sword
54;00:10:32,246;00:10:35,715;through their hearts.
55;00:10:35,749;00:10:38,584;Plenty of little men
56;00:10:38,618;00:10:41,554;tried to put their swords
56;00:10:38,618;00:10:41,554;through my heart.
57;00:10:41,588;00:10:44,356;And there's plenty

58;00:10:44,391;00:10:46,058;buried in the woods.
59;00:10:47,828;00:10:51,130;What's your name, boy?

62;00:11:04,111;00:11:05,779;Did you hear that?
63;00:11:05,813;00:11:08,882;From now on, you'd better
63;00:11:05,813;00:11:08,882;kneel every time I fart.
64;00:11:08,916;00:11:12,318;Stand, boy.
65;00:11:14,455;00:11:17,457;We don't kneel for anyone
65;00:11:14,455;00:11:17,457;beyond the Wall.
66;00:11:20,194;00:11:25,332;So, you're

68;00:11:27,535;00:11:30,204;You can leave us.
69;00:11:38,713;00:11:40,514;The girl likes you.
70;00:11:40,548;00:11:42,716;You like her back, Snow?
71;00:11:42,751;00:11:45,119;That why you want
71;00:11:42,751;00:11:45,119;to join us?
72;00:11:45,153;00:11:46,921;Don't panic, boy.
73;00:11:46,956;00:11:49,157;This isn't the damned

74;00:11:49,192;00:11:51,393;swear off girls.
75;00:11:51,427;00:11:55,096;This chicken eater you thought
75;00:11:51,427;00:11:55,096;was king is Tormund Giantsbane.
76;00:11:55,131;00:11:57,566;Can't believe this pup
77;00:11:57,600;00:11:59,901;killed the Halfhand.
78;00:11:59,935;00:12:02,136;He was our enemy
79;00:12:02,171;00:12:05,039;and I'm glad he's dead.
80;00:12:14,815;00:12:17,517;He was my brother once.
81;00:12:17,552;00:12:20,220;Back when he had
81;00:12:17,552;00:12:20,220;a whole hand.
82;00:12:21,789;00:12:23,757;What were you
82;00:12:21,789;00:12:23,757;doing with him?
83;00:12:23,791;00:12:27,094;The Lord Commander sent me
83;00:12:23,791;00:12:27,094;to the Halfhand for seasoning.
84;00:12:27,128;00:12:28,962;Why?
85;00:12:28,996;00:12:30,764;He wants me to lead
85;00:12:28,996;00:12:30,764;one day.
86;00:12:30,798;00:12:34,268;But here you are,
86;00:12:30,798;00:12:34,268;a traitor
87;00:12:34,302;00:12:36,770;kneeling before
87;00:12:34,302;00:12:36,770;the King-beyond-the-Wall.
88;00:12:36,838;00:12:40,374;If I'm a traitor,
88;00:12:36,838;00:12:40,374;then you are, too.
89;00:12:47,649;00:12:50,985;Why do you want
89;00:12:47,649;00:12:50,985;to join us, Jon Snow?
90;00:12:56,958;00:12:58,926;I want to be free.
91;00:12:58,960;00:13:02,096;No, I don't think so.
92;00:13:03,365;00:13:05,299;I think what you want
92;00:13:03,365;00:13:05,299;most of all
93;00:13:05,333;00:13:07,534;is to be a hero.
94;00:13:07,569;00:13:11,472;I'll ask you
94;00:13:07,569;00:13:11,472;one last time--
95;00:13:11,539;00:13:14,541;why do you want
95;00:13:11,539;00:13:14,541;to join us?
96;00:13:18,980;00:13:22,582;We stopped at Craster's
96;00:13:18,980;00:13:22,582;Keep on the way north.
97;00:13:24,052;00:13:26,486;I saw...
98;00:13:26,520;00:13:28,087;You saw what?
99;00:13:30,391;00:13:32,458;I saw Craster take
99;00:13:30,391;00:13:32,458;his own baby boy
100;00:13:32,492;00:13:35,227;and leave it
100;00:13:32,492;00:13:35,227;in the woods.
101;00:13:35,261;00:13:37,529;I saw what took it.
102;00:13:41,068;00:13:45,171;You're telling me
102;00:13:41,068;00:13:45,171;you saw one of them?
103;00:13:48,009;00:13:50,511;And why would that make you
103;00:13:48,009;00:13:50,511;desert your brothers?
104;00:13:50,545;00:13:53,614;Because when I told
104;00:13:50,545;00:13:53,614;the Lord Commander,
105;00:13:53,648;00:13:55,649;he already knew.
106;00:13:57,618;00:14:00,254;Thousands of years ago,
106;00:13:57,618;00:14:00,254;the First Men
107;00:14:00,288;00:14:03,624;battled the White Walkers
107;00:14:00,288;00:14:03,624;and defeated them.
108;00:14:03,658;00:14:07,628;I want to fight for the side
108;00:14:03,658;00:14:07,628;that fights for the living.
109;00:14:10,698;00:14:12,900;Did I come
109;00:14:10,698;00:14:12,900;to the right place?
110;00:14:17,672;00:14:20,440;We'll need to find you
110;00:14:17,672;00:14:20,440;a new cloak.
111;00:14:41,563;00:14:43,764;What if you took off
111;00:14:41,563;00:14:43,764;that bit there?
112;00:14:45,901;00:14:49,503;Don't you want to leave
112;00:14:45,901;00:14:49,503;something to the imagination?
113;00:14:49,537;00:14:53,439;Trouble is, I've never
113;00:14:49,537;00:14:53,439;had much imagination.
114;00:14:56,009;00:14:58,611;I want you to take it off.
115;00:15:04,917;00:15:06,785;Mouth.
116;00:15:12,391;00:15:15,559;Ser Bronn.
116;00:15:12,391;00:15:15,559;Ser Bronn.
117;00:15:17,462;00:15:19,430;I didn't hear that.
118;00:15:19,464;00:15:21,465;Apologies, ser.
118;00:15:19,464;00:15:21,465;- Back away.
119;00:15:21,499;00:15:24,435;Keep backing away till you're
119;00:15:21,499;00:15:24,435;outside this establishment.
120;00:15:24,469;00:15:28,105;Then back away some more.
120;00:15:24,469;00:15:28,105;Lord Tyrion sent me.
121;00:15:28,139;00:15:31,108;I will murder you, boy.
122;00:15:31,142;00:15:33,610;He said it was a matter
122;00:15:31,142;00:15:33,610;of life and death.
123;00:15:50,459;00:15:53,628;Pod?
123;00:15:50,459;00:15:53,628;- It's your sister.
124;00:15:54,898;00:15:57,233;The queen.
125;00:16:10,014;00:16:11,282;What are they doing here?
126;00:16:11,316;00:16:14,485;Protecting me, I assume.
126;00:16:11,316;00:16:14,485;Will you let me in?
127;00:16:15,954;00:16:17,354;No, I don't think so.
128;00:16:17,389;00:16:19,090;If I wanted to kill you,
128;00:16:17,389;00:16:19,090;do you think
129;00:16:19,124;00:16:21,792;I'd let a wooden door
129;00:16:19,124;00:16:21,792;stop me?
130;00:16:27,799;00:16:29,300;They stay outside.
131;00:16:29,334;00:16:31,569;I'm not afraid of you,
131;00:16:29,334;00:16:31,569;little brother.
132;00:16:46,585;00:16:49,987;Why are you here?
132;00:16:46,585;00:16:49,987;I wanted to see your face.
133;00:16:50,022;00:16:53,592;They said you'd lost your nose, but
133;00:16:50,022;00:16:53,592;it's not as gruesome as all that.
134;00:16:54,927;00:16:57,062;The man who cut me
134;00:16:54,927;00:16:57,062;lost more than his nose.
135;00:16:57,096;00:16:59,465;I should hope so.
136;00:16:59,499;00:17:02,801;The rebels came for Joffrey's
136;00:16:59,499;00:17:02,801;head, they lost their own.
137;00:17:02,835;00:17:04,903;Thanks to Father.
138;00:17:04,938;00:17:07,406;Thanks to Father.
139;00:17:08,908;00:17:11,010;Of course, it wasn't a rebel
139;00:17:08,908;00:17:11,010;who tried to kill me.
140;00:17:11,044;00:17:13,579;No? Curious.
141;00:17:13,613;00:17:17,416;Bit of a comedown
141;00:17:13,613;00:17:17,416;from chamber of the Hand.
142;00:17:17,450;00:17:19,652;But then I don't suppose
142;00:17:17,450;00:17:19,652;you need much room.
143;00:17:19,687;00:17:22,655;Grand Maester Pycelle
143;00:17:19,687;00:17:22,655;made the same joke.
144;00:17:22,689;00:17:25,992;You must be proud to be as funny as
144;00:17:22,689;00:17:25,992;a man whose balls brush his knees.
145;00:17:26,026;00:17:27,793;You're meeting
145;00:17:26,026;00:17:27,793;Father today?
146;00:17:27,828;00:17:29,896;How do you know that?
147;00:17:29,930;00:17:32,766;Because I have hundreds
147;00:17:29,930;00:17:32,766;of spies in my employ.
148;00:17:32,800;00:17:36,302;The Master of Whisperers
148;00:17:32,800;00:17:36,302;owes me a favor or two.
149;00:17:37,905;00:17:40,940;Father told me.
149;00:17:37,905;00:17:40,940;What do you want from him?
150;00:17:40,975;00:17:42,608;What do I want from him?
150;00:17:40,975;00:17:42,608;He's my father.
151;00:17:42,642;00:17:45,144;Do I need
151;00:17:42,642;00:17:45,144;to want something?
152;00:17:47,713;00:17:49,814;I'm sure
152;00:17:47,713;00:17:49,814;he loves me dearly,
153;00:17:49,849;00:17:51,549;as any father loves
153;00:17:49,849;00:17:51,549;his child,
154;00:17:51,584;00:17:54,252;his baby boy.
155;00:17:54,286;00:17:56,354;Yet he hasn't come
155;00:17:54,286;00:17:56,354;to visit once
156;00:17:56,421;00:17:58,022;since arriving
156;00:17:56,421;00:17:58,022;in King's Landing.
157;00:17:58,056;00:18:01,158;I lay here,
157;00:17:58,056;00:18:01,158;my face split in half,
158;00:18:01,226;00:18:03,728;but Father never came.
159;00:18:08,867;00:18:11,301;You're going
159;00:18:08,867;00:18:11,301;to make me cry.
160;00:18:11,335;00:18:13,703;Why do you care
160;00:18:11,335;00:18:13,703;what I want from him?
161;00:18:15,172;00:18:17,207;Because you've slandered me
161;00:18:15,172;00:18:17,207;to Father before.
162;00:18:17,241;00:18:19,475;Slandered?
162;00:18:17,241;00:18:19,475;When?
163;00:18:19,509;00:18:21,744;You told him
163;00:18:19,509;00:18:21,744;I had my guards
164;00:18:21,778;00:18:23,645;beat that servant girl
164;00:18:21,778;00:18:23,645;at Casterly Rock.
165;00:18:23,680;00:18:25,514;You did have
165;00:18:23,680;00:18:25,514;your guards beat her.
166;00:18:25,548;00:18:26,782;A girl of nine,
166;00:18:25,548;00:18:26,782;I believe.
167;00:18:26,816;00:18:28,617;I was nine, too.
168;00:18:28,651;00:18:30,685;She lost an eye,
168;00:18:28,651;00:18:30,685;if I remember correctly.
169;00:18:30,720;00:18:32,120;If I remember correctly,
170;00:18:32,154;00:18:34,389;she never stole
170;00:18:32,154;00:18:34,389;a necklace again.
171;00:18:36,092;00:18:38,994;It's not slander
171;00:18:36,092;00:18:38,994;if it's true.
172;00:18:39,028;00:18:41,730;And what's this truth
172;00:18:39,028;00:18:41,730;you plan on telling him today?
173;00:18:41,764;00:18:43,498;Why are you so nervous
174;00:18:43,532;00:18:45,767;about what I'm going
174;00:18:43,532;00:18:45,767;to say to Father?
175;00:18:45,801;00:18:47,869;Because you're a liar.
176;00:18:47,904;00:18:50,973;I expect you'll tell lies
176;00:18:47,904;00:18:50,973;about me, about Joffrey.
177;00:18:51,007;00:18:53,476;Any lies in particular?
178;00:18:55,212;00:18:57,647;You're a clever man,
179;00:18:57,682;00:18:59,950;but you're not half as clever
179;00:18:57,682;00:18:59,950;as you think you are.
180;00:18:59,984;00:19:03,020;Still makes me
180;00:18:59,984;00:19:03,020;more clever than you.
181;00:19:06,524;00:19:09,827;Oh, look at these two
181;00:19:06,524;00:19:09,827;shining warriors.
182;00:19:09,861;00:19:13,330;Ser Taryn Mant and...
183;00:19:13,364;00:19:15,099;Ser Whosit of Whocares.
184;00:19:15,133;00:19:16,500;Ser Meryn Trant.
185;00:19:16,535;00:19:19,070;Ser Bronn
185;00:19:16,535;00:19:19,070;of the Blackwater.
186;00:19:19,104;00:19:21,706;You're no knight.
186;00:19:19,104;00:19:21,706;Pod.
187;00:19:21,740;00:19:23,174;Ser Bronn
187;00:19:21,740;00:19:23,174;of the Blackwater
188;00:19:23,208;00:19:25,109;was anointed
188;00:19:23,208;00:19:25,109;by the king himself.
189;00:19:25,177;00:19:27,845;You're an up-jumped
189;00:19:25,177;00:19:27,845;cutthroat,
190;00:19:27,880;00:19:29,481;nothing more.
191;00:19:29,515;00:19:31,450;That's exactly who I am.
192;00:19:31,484;00:19:33,251;And you're a grub
192;00:19:31,484;00:19:33,251;in fancy armor
193;00:19:33,286;00:19:36,555;who's better at beating little
193;00:19:33,286;00:19:36,555;girls than fighting men.
194;00:19:36,589;00:19:39,358;Now, I have an appointment
194;00:19:36,589;00:19:39,358;with Lord Tyrion.
195;00:19:39,393;00:19:42,228;You put your hand
195;00:19:39,393;00:19:42,228;on that door,
196;00:19:42,263;00:19:44,864;you lose the hand.
197;00:20:00,681;00:20:03,382;As much as I appreciate a walk
197;00:20:00,681;00:20:03,382;in the sunshine, your lordship,
198;00:20:03,417;00:20:05,551;I am wondering
198;00:20:03,417;00:20:05,551;why you sent for me.
199;00:20:05,585;00:20:07,686;A number of people
199;00:20:05,585;00:20:07,686;in this city want to kill me.
200;00:20:07,720;00:20:09,020;You're here to protect me.
201;00:20:09,055;00:20:11,256;I've been doing that
201;00:20:09,055;00:20:11,256;for a while now.
202;00:20:11,290;00:20:13,058;Do you grow bored
202;00:20:11,290;00:20:13,058;protecting me?
203;00:20:13,092;00:20:14,559;I grow poor
203;00:20:13,092;00:20:14,559;protecting you.
204;00:20:14,593;00:20:16,494;Poor?
204;00:20:14,593;00:20:16,494;Poor?
205;00:20:16,562;00:20:18,596;Under my patronage
205;00:20:16,562;00:20:18,596;you've become a knight,
206;00:20:18,631;00:20:20,698;you've served as Commander
206;00:20:18,631;00:20:20,698;of the City Watch.
207;00:20:20,733;00:20:23,468;Briefly.
207;00:20:20,733;00:20:23,468;I'm sure you filled your pockets.
208;00:20:23,502;00:20:25,570;And now my pockets
208;00:20:23,502;00:20:25,570;are empty.
209;00:20:25,604;00:20:27,939;You've given me a taste
209;00:20:25,604;00:20:27,939;for the finer things.
210;00:20:27,974;00:20:29,975;And if you want me
210;00:20:27,974;00:20:29,975;to carry on protecting you,
211;00:20:30,009;00:20:31,343;you'll need to pay more.
212;00:20:31,377;00:20:33,845;I thought we were friends.
212;00:20:31,377;00:20:33,845;We are.
213;00:20:33,879;00:20:36,648;But I'm a sellsword.
213;00:20:33,879;00:20:36,648;I sell my sword.
214;00:20:36,682;00:20:38,449;I don't loan it out
214;00:20:36,682;00:20:38,449;to friends as a favor.
215;00:20:38,484;00:20:39,917;How much?
215;00:20:38,484;00:20:39,917;Double.
216;00:20:39,952;00:20:42,119;Double?
216;00:20:39,952;00:20:42,119;I'm a knight now.
217;00:20:42,154;00:20:43,587;Knights
217;00:20:42,154;00:20:43,587;are worth double.
218;00:20:43,622;00:20:45,990;I don't even know how much
218;00:20:43,622;00:20:45,990;I'm paying you now.
219;00:20:46,024;00:20:48,092;Which means
219;00:20:46,024;00:20:48,092;you can afford it.
220;00:21:26,129;00:21:28,664;Here. Here!
221;00:21:36,975;00:21:39,476;Help me!
222;00:22:02,135;00:22:03,435;Who are you?
223;00:22:05,972;00:22:10,176;I was in the battle
223;00:22:05,972;00:22:10,176;at Blackwater.
224;00:22:11,445;00:22:15,215;I was a captain
224;00:22:11,445;00:22:15,215;and a knight.
225;00:22:15,249;00:22:19,119;Aye, ser,
225;00:22:15,249;00:22:19,119;and serving which king?
226;00:22:24,693;00:22:27,462;The one true king
226;00:22:24,693;00:22:27,462;of Westeros--
227;00:22:30,099;00:22:32,166;Stannis Baratheon.
228;00:22:41,709;00:22:43,343;I thought you were dead.
229;00:22:43,378;00:22:46,012;Everyone thought
229;00:22:43,378;00:22:46,012;you were dead.
230;00:22:50,317;00:22:51,584;And your son?
231;00:22:57,357;00:22:59,759;He may have swam
231;00:22:57,357;00:22:59,759;ashore as you did.
232;00:22:59,793;00:23:02,829;No, the wildfire took him.
232;00:22:59,793;00:23:02,829;I saw it.
233;00:23:12,339;00:23:15,574;I'm so sorry,
233;00:23:12,339;00:23:15,574;my friend.
234;00:23:15,609;00:23:18,144;I, too, have lost a son.
235;00:23:18,178;00:23:20,546;There is nothing worse
235;00:23:18,178;00:23:20,546;in this world.
236;00:23:22,215;00:23:25,450;But, Davos, you were
236;00:23:22,215;00:23:25,450;a good father.
237;00:23:25,484;00:23:29,020;If I was a good father,
237;00:23:25,484;00:23:29,020;he'd still be here.
238;00:23:31,990;00:23:33,624;Stannis lives?
239;00:23:33,658;00:23:35,860;He licks his wounds
239;00:23:33,658;00:23:35,860;at Dragonstone.
240;00:23:35,894;00:23:37,661;Will you take me there?
241;00:23:37,696;00:23:40,097;There is nothing for me
241;00:23:37,696;00:23:40,097;at Dragonstone.
242;00:23:40,132;00:23:41,598;This war is not over.
243;00:23:41,633;00:23:42,966;Not for you, maybe.
244;00:23:43,001;00:23:45,736;But for Salladhor Saan,
244;00:23:43,001;00:23:45,736;the war is over.
245;00:23:45,770;00:23:47,771;We're both sworn
245;00:23:45,770;00:23:47,771;to King Stannis.
246;00:23:47,805;00:23:50,274;I am sworn to no man.
247;00:23:50,308;00:23:54,111;I promised you 30 ships and you
247;00:23:50,308;00:23:54,111;promised me riches and glory.
248;00:23:54,145;00:23:55,646;I delivered the ships.
249;00:23:55,681;00:23:57,849;Stannis never gives up.
249;00:23:55,681;00:23:57,849;Never.
250;00:23:57,883;00:24:00,285;Now he will regroup--
250;00:23:57,883;00:24:00,285;He's a broken man.
251;00:24:00,319;00:24:02,788;His fleet lies at the bottom
251;00:24:00,319;00:24:02,788;of Blackwater Bay.
252;00:24:02,822;00:24:04,457;They say he sees no one--
253;00:24:04,491;00:24:06,726;not his generals,
253;00:24:04,491;00:24:06,726;not even his wife.
254;00:24:06,760;00:24:09,763;Only the Red Woman
255;00:24:09,797;00:24:11,164;whispering in his ear,
256;00:24:11,198;00:24:14,033;telling him what
256;00:24:11,198;00:24:14,033;she sees in the flames
257;00:24:14,068;00:24:15,702;and burning men alive.
258;00:24:15,736;00:24:17,170;What?
259;00:24:17,205;00:24:20,707;They built a great fire
259;00:24:17,205;00:24:20,707;when Stannis returned.
260;00:24:20,741;00:24:23,643;All those who spoke
260;00:24:20,741;00:24:23,643;against her she called
261;00:24:23,677;00:24:26,279;servants of darkness.
262;00:24:28,248;00:24:30,783;They say she sang
262;00:24:28,248;00:24:30,783;to them as they burned.
263;00:24:35,589;00:24:37,090;I'm a pirate.
264;00:24:37,124;00:24:39,425;You're a smuggler.
265;00:24:39,460;00:24:41,127;Servants of darkness.
266;00:24:41,161;00:24:44,430;I'm thinking Dragonstone is a
266;00:24:41,161;00:24:44,430;good place for us to avoid.
267;00:24:44,464;00:24:46,731;Take me back there, please.
268;00:24:46,766;00:24:48,666;You cannot turn
268;00:24:46,766;00:24:48,666;Stannis against her.
269;00:24:48,701;00:24:51,335;Maybe not, but I could
269;00:24:48,701;00:24:51,335;carve her heart out.
270;00:24:51,370;00:24:52,970;You could try.
271;00:24:53,005;00:24:55,373;If you fail,
271;00:24:53,005;00:24:55,373;they will burn you.
272;00:24:55,407;00:24:58,276;If you succeed,
272;00:24:55,407;00:24:58,276;they'll burn you.
273;00:24:58,310;00:25:00,445;And you've only
273;00:24:58,310;00:25:00,445;just come back to life.
274;00:25:00,479;00:25:02,714;Stay alive a little
274;00:25:00,479;00:25:02,714;longer, my friend.
275;00:25:02,748;00:25:05,483;You call me friend. You drank
275;00:25:02,748;00:25:05,483;with me on my wedding day.
276;00:25:05,517;00:25:07,985;And you drank with me
276;00:25:05,517;00:25:07,985;on four of my wedding days,
277;00:25:08,020;00:25:09,921;but I don't ask you
277;00:25:08,020;00:25:09,921;for favors.
278;00:25:09,955;00:25:11,556;I have to stop her.
279;00:25:11,590;00:25:14,726;Please, do this for me.
280;00:25:17,564;00:25:19,932;When you are dead,
281;00:25:19,966;00:25:22,401;I will gather your bones
281;00:25:19,966;00:25:22,401;in a little sack
282;00:25:22,435;00:25:25,538;and let your widow
282;00:25:22,435;00:25:25,538;wear them around her neck.
283;00:25:38,486;00:25:41,754;We should set the siege lines
283;00:25:38,486;00:25:41,754;1,000 yards from Harrenhal.
284;00:25:41,788;00:25:44,557;There won't be a siege. The
284;00:25:41,788;00:25:44,557;Mountain can't defend a ruin.
285;00:25:44,591;00:25:46,092;I imagine the Mountain
285;00:25:44,591;00:25:46,092;will defend
286;00:25:46,126;00:25:47,993;whatever Tywin Lannister
286;00:25:46,126;00:25:47,993;tells him to defend.
287;00:25:48,028;00:25:50,196;The Lannisters have been
287;00:25:48,028;00:25:50,196;running from us since Oxcross.
288;00:25:50,230;00:25:52,932;I'd love a fight.
288;00:25:50,230;00:25:52,932;The men would love a fight.
289;00:25:52,967;00:25:55,769;I don't think
289;00:25:52,967;00:25:55,769;we're going to get one.
290;00:26:43,720;00:26:48,090;200 Northmen
290;00:26:43,720;00:26:48,090;slaughtered like sheep.
291;00:26:48,158;00:26:51,161;The debt will be
291;00:26:48,158;00:26:51,161;repaid, my friend.
292;00:26:51,195;00:26:53,997;For them
292;00:26:51,195;00:26:53,997;and for your sons.
293;00:26:54,031;00:26:56,199;Will it?
294;00:26:56,266;00:26:58,567;They rot in the ground
295;00:26:58,601;00:27:00,803;while their killer
295;00:26:58,601;00:27:00,803;runs free.
296;00:27:00,837;00:27:03,772;The Kingslayer won't
296;00:27:00,837;00:27:03,772;remain free for long.
297;00:27:03,807;00:27:06,642;My best hunters
297;00:27:03,807;00:27:06,642;are after him.
298;00:27:25,328;00:27:29,298;- A Mallister?
298;00:27:25,328;00:27:29,298;Ser Jeremy.
299;00:27:29,332;00:27:31,867;My father's bannerman.
300;00:27:52,156;00:27:55,091;Find her a chamber
300;00:27:52,156;00:27:55,091;that will serve as a cell.
301;00:28:07,437;00:28:08,805;She's your mother.
302;00:28:08,839;00:28:11,474;She freed
302;00:28:08,839;00:28:11,474;Jaime Lannister.
303;00:28:11,509;00:28:13,877;The Lannisters robbed
303;00:28:11,509;00:28:13,877;them of their sons
304;00:28:13,911;00:28:15,679;and she robbed them
304;00:28:13,911;00:28:15,679;of their justice.
305;00:28:17,748;00:28:18,982;Water.
306;00:28:21,185;00:28:22,819;Water.
307;00:28:22,854;00:28:25,088;This needs to be
307;00:28:22,854;00:28:25,088;cleaned and closed.
308;00:28:29,661;00:28:31,830;What's your name, friend?
309;00:28:31,864;00:28:33,731;Qyburn.
310;00:28:33,766;00:28:35,133;You're lucky to be alive.
311;00:28:38,337;00:28:40,872;Lucky?
312;00:29:06,769;00:29:08,837;The badge
312;00:29:06,769;00:29:08,837;looks good on you.
313;00:29:10,673;00:29:13,308;Almost as good
313;00:29:10,673;00:29:13,308;as it looked on me.
314;00:29:15,577;00:29:18,680;Are you enjoying
314;00:29:15,577;00:29:18,680;your new position?
315;00:29:20,349;00:29:21,850;Am I enjoying it?
316;00:29:21,884;00:29:24,286;I was very happy
316;00:29:21,884;00:29:24,286;as Hand of the King.
317;00:29:24,320;00:29:26,354;Yes.
318;00:29:26,388;00:29:28,356;I heard how happy you were.
319;00:29:30,292;00:29:32,860;You brought a whore
319;00:29:30,292;00:29:32,860;into my bed.
320;00:29:32,894;00:29:35,496;It wasn't your bed
320;00:29:32,894;00:29:35,496;at the time.
321;00:29:37,933;00:29:40,868;I sent you here
321;00:29:37,933;00:29:40,868;to advise the king.
322;00:29:40,902;00:29:44,938;I gave you real power
322;00:29:40,902;00:29:44,938;and authority.
323;00:29:44,972;00:29:47,307;You chose
323;00:29:44,972;00:29:47,307;to spend your days
324;00:29:47,341;00:29:49,509;as you always have,
325;00:29:49,543;00:29:51,978;bedding harlots
326;00:29:52,012;00:29:54,380;and drinking with thieves.
327;00:29:56,383;00:29:59,185;Occasionally I drank
327;00:29:56,383;00:29:59,185;with the harlots.
328;00:29:59,219;00:30:01,587;What do you want, Tyrion?
329;00:30:01,622;00:30:04,624;Why does everyone assume
329;00:30:01,622;00:30:04,624;I want something?
330;00:30:04,658;00:30:07,560;Can't I simply visit
330;00:30:04,658;00:30:07,560;with my beloved father?
331;00:30:07,595;00:30:11,197;My beloved father who
332;00:30:11,231;00:30:13,933;somehow forgot to visit
332;00:30:11,231;00:30:13,933;his wounded son
333;00:30:13,967;00:30:15,801;after he fell
333;00:30:13,967;00:30:15,801;on the battlefield.
334;00:30:15,836;00:30:19,405;Maester Pycelle assured me
334;00:30:15,836;00:30:19,405;your wounds were not fatal.
335;00:30:19,439;00:30:22,441;I organized
335;00:30:19,439;00:30:22,441;the defense of this city
336;00:30:22,475;00:30:25,644;while you held court
336;00:30:22,475;00:30:25,644;in the ruins of Harrenhal.
337;00:30:25,678;00:30:28,412;I led the foray when the
337;00:30:25,678;00:30:28,412;enemies were at the gate
338;00:30:28,447;00:30:30,715;while your grandson,
338;00:30:28,447;00:30:30,715;the king,
339;00:30:30,749;00:30:33,384;quivered in fear
339;00:30:30,749;00:30:33,384;behind the walls.
340;00:30:33,418;00:30:37,021;I bled in the mud
340;00:30:33,418;00:30:37,021;for our family.
341;00:30:37,990;00:30:39,524;And as my reward,
342;00:30:39,558;00:30:42,894;I was trundled off
342;00:30:39,558;00:30:42,894;to some dark little cell.
343;00:30:42,928;00:30:44,929;But what do I want?
344;00:30:46,265;00:30:48,399;A little bloody gratitude
344;00:30:46,265;00:30:48,399;would be a start.
345;00:30:48,434;00:30:51,669;Jugglers and singers
345;00:30:48,434;00:30:51,669;require applause.
346;00:30:51,704;00:30:54,139;You are a Lannister.
347;00:30:54,173;00:30:57,208;Do you think I demanded
347;00:30:54,173;00:30:57,208;a garland of roses
348;00:30:57,243;00:30:59,945;every time I suffered
348;00:30:57,243;00:30:59,945;a wound on a battlefield?
349;00:30:59,979;00:31:01,946;Hmm?
350;00:31:02,014;00:31:05,783;Now, I have seven kingdoms
350;00:31:02,014;00:31:05,783;to look after
351;00:31:05,851;00:31:08,185;and three of them
351;00:31:05,851;00:31:08,185;are in open rebellion.
352;00:31:08,220;00:31:12,990;So tell me what you want.
353;00:31:16,896;00:31:19,698;I want what is mine
353;00:31:16,896;00:31:19,698;by right.
354;00:31:21,401;00:31:24,737;Jaime is your eldest son,
354;00:31:21,401;00:31:24,737;heir to your lands and titles.
355;00:31:24,805;00:31:29,076;But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden
355;00:31:24,805;00:31:29,076;from marriage or inheritance.
356;00:31:29,110;00:31:31,145;The day Jaime put on
356;00:31:29,110;00:31:31,145;the white cloak,
357;00:31:31,179;00:31:34,948;he gave up his claim
357;00:31:31,179;00:31:34,948;to Casterly Rock.
358;00:31:34,983;00:31:38,051;I am your son
358;00:31:34,983;00:31:38,051;and lawful heir.
359;00:31:41,022;00:31:42,656;You want Casterly Rock?
360;00:31:42,691;00:31:44,658;It is mine by right.
361;00:31:49,231;00:31:51,332;We'll find you
361;00:31:49,231;00:31:51,332;accommodations
362;00:31:51,367;00:31:53,268;more suited
362;00:31:51,367;00:31:53,268;to your name
363;00:31:53,302;00:31:55,670;and as a reward
363;00:31:53,302;00:31:55,670;for your accomplishments
364;00:31:55,704;00:31:58,573;during the battle
364;00:31:55,704;00:31:58,573;of Blackwater Bay.
365;00:32:00,276;00:32:02,277;And when the time is right,
365;00:32:00,276;00:32:02,277;you will be given a position
366;00:32:02,311;00:32:03,978;fit for your talents
367;00:32:04,013;00:32:06,548;so that you can
367;00:32:04,013;00:32:06,548;serve your family
368;00:32:06,582;00:32:08,683;and protect our legacy.
369;00:32:08,718;00:32:10,352;And if you serve
369;00:32:08,718;00:32:10,352;faithfully,
370;00:32:10,386;00:32:12,921;you will be rewarded
370;00:32:10,386;00:32:12,921;with a suitable wife.
371;00:32:12,955;00:32:16,791;And I would let myself
371;00:32:12,955;00:32:16,791;be consumed by maggots
372;00:32:16,825;00:32:18,093;before mocking
372;00:32:16,825;00:32:18,093;the family name
373;00:32:18,127;00:32:21,063;and making you
373;00:32:18,127;00:32:21,063;heir to Casterly Rock.
374;00:32:22,665;00:32:25,466;Why?
374;00:32:22,665;00:32:25,466;Why?
375;00:32:25,500;00:32:27,635;You ask that?
376;00:32:27,669;00:32:31,071;You, who killed your mother
376;00:32:27,669;00:32:31,071;to come into the world?
377;00:32:31,106;00:32:35,242;You are an ill-made,
377;00:32:31,106;00:32:35,242;spiteful little creature
378;00:32:35,310;00:32:39,280;full of envy, lust,
378;00:32:35,310;00:32:39,280;and low cunning.
379;00:32:39,314;00:32:41,882;Men's laws give you
379;00:32:39,314;00:32:41,882;the right to bear my name
380;00:32:41,917;00:32:46,520;and display my colors since I
380;00:32:41,917;00:32:46,520;cannot prove that you are not mine.
381;00:32:48,223;00:32:50,591;And to teach me humility,
381;00:32:48,223;00:32:50,591;the gods have condemned me
382;00:32:50,625;00:32:54,027;to watch you waddle about
382;00:32:50,625;00:32:54,027;wearing that proud lion
383;00:32:54,062;00:32:57,965;that was my father's sigil
383;00:32:54,062;00:32:57,965;and his father's before him.
384;00:32:57,999;00:32:59,700;But neither gods nor men
385;00:32:59,734;00:33:02,636;will ever compel me
385;00:32:59,734;00:33:02,636;to let you turn Casterly Rock
386;00:33:02,670;00:33:05,772;into your whorehouse.
387;00:33:05,807;00:33:08,675;Go, now.
388;00:33:11,846;00:33:15,582;Speak no more of your rights
388;00:33:11,846;00:33:15,582;to Casterly Rock.
389;00:33:17,584;00:33:19,786;Go.
390;00:33:28,762;00:33:30,896;Oh, one more thing.
391;00:33:33,233;00:33:36,435;The next whore I catch
391;00:33:33,233;00:33:36,435;in your bed I'll hang.
392;00:33:44,378;00:33:47,181;Dorne.
392;00:33:44,378;00:33:47,181;It's going to Dorne.
393;00:33:47,215;00:33:50,117;- Why Dorne?
393;00:33:47,215;00:33:50,117;It's carrying silk
394;00:33:50,152;00:33:53,621;and it's supposed to bring
394;00:33:50,152;00:33:53,621;back wine in exchange.
395;00:33:57,659;00:33:59,993;But it's not
395;00:33:57,659;00:33:59,993;coming back.
396;00:34:00,028;00:34:02,629;The captain's tired
396;00:34:00,028;00:34:02,629;of risking his life
397;00:34:02,664;00:34:04,832;so King's Landing
397;00:34:02,664;00:34:04,832;lords and ladies
398;00:34:04,866;00:34:07,935;can get drunk on better
398;00:34:04,866;00:34:07,935;wine than they deserve.
399;00:34:09,304;00:34:11,506;He's going
399;00:34:09,304;00:34:11,506;to stay in Dorne.
400;00:34:11,540;00:34:14,876;Wait out the winter where
400;00:34:11,540;00:34:14,876;it's beautiful and warm.
401;00:34:14,910;00:34:18,680;I met some people in Dorne who
401;00:34:14,910;00:34:18,680;weren't so beautiful and warm.
402;00:34:18,715;00:34:20,683;Don't ruin the game.
403;00:34:20,717;00:34:23,453;I told you,
403;00:34:20,717;00:34:23,453;I don't want to play.
404;00:34:24,555;00:34:26,589;What about that one there?
405;00:34:26,624;00:34:28,091;That one?
406;00:34:28,125;00:34:30,127;It's going to Volantis.
407;00:34:30,161;00:34:31,595;Why?
408;00:34:31,629;00:34:33,330;Because when I got
408;00:34:31,629;00:34:33,330;on a ship in Volantis,
409;00:34:33,364;00:34:35,899;it looked like that one.
410;00:34:35,934;00:34:37,735;That's not how
410;00:34:35,934;00:34:37,735;the game works.
411;00:34:37,769;00:34:41,339;You're not supposed to just
411;00:34:37,769;00:34:41,339;blurt out the right answer.
412;00:34:41,373;00:34:42,973;You've got
412;00:34:41,373;00:34:42,973;to invent a story
413;00:34:43,008;00:34:46,443;about where the ship
413;00:34:43,008;00:34:46,443;is going and why.
414;00:34:46,478;00:34:49,347;Why should I make up a story
414;00:34:46,478;00:34:49,347;when I know the truth?
415;00:34:49,381;00:34:51,415;Because the truth
416;00:34:51,450;00:34:53,985;is always either
416;00:34:51,450;00:34:53,985;terrible or boring.
417;00:34:54,019;00:34:56,788;Lovely day for it.
418;00:34:56,822;00:34:58,724;Watching the ships.
419;00:34:58,758;00:35:01,727;Lord Baelish.
420;00:35:01,762;00:35:04,797;Might I speak
420;00:35:01,762;00:35:04,797;with Lady Sansa
421;00:35:04,832;00:35:06,466;alone for a moment?
422;00:35:17,945;00:35:20,813;I saw your mother
422;00:35:17,945;00:35:20,813;not long ago.
423;00:35:22,215;00:35:24,516;She's very eager
423;00:35:22,215;00:35:24,516;to see you.
424;00:35:26,286;00:35:29,587;And your sister.
425;00:35:29,622;00:35:32,224;Arya's alive?
426;00:35:35,528;00:35:37,395;You said
426;00:35:35,528;00:35:37,395;you'd take me home.
427;00:35:37,429;00:35:40,798;You said King's Landing
427;00:35:37,429;00:35:40,798;was your home.
428;00:35:42,000;00:35:43,367;You are the property
428;00:35:42,000;00:35:43,367;of the crown.
429;00:35:43,401;00:35:44,768;Stealing you
429;00:35:43,401;00:35:44,768;would be treason.
430;00:35:44,803;00:35:47,037;If you were to tell
430;00:35:44,803;00:35:47,037;just one person--
431;00:35:47,072;00:35:49,073;I won't tell anyone.
431;00:35:47,072;00:35:49,073;How do I know?
432;00:35:49,107;00:35:51,041;Because I'm a terrible liar.
433;00:35:51,075;00:35:53,710;You said so yourself.
434;00:35:53,744;00:35:56,913;Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do.
434;00:35:53,744;00:35:56,913;Tell me when.
435;00:36:00,150;00:36:01,684;I'm waiting for word
435;00:36:00,150;00:36:01,684;on an assignment
436;00:36:01,718;00:36:04,920;that will take me far away
436;00:36:01,718;00:36:04,920;from the capital.
437;00:36:04,988;00:36:06,655;When I set sail,
438;00:36:06,689;00:36:09,224;I might be able
438;00:36:06,689;00:36:09,224;to take you with me.
439;00:36:09,258;00:36:12,260;But you'll need to be ready to
439;00:36:09,258;00:36:12,260;leave on a moment's notice.
440;00:36:14,697;00:36:16,965;You're her handmaiden?
441;00:36:19,001;00:36:21,837;Yes.
441;00:36:19,001;00:36:21,837;And you're his...?
442;00:36:21,871;00:36:25,341;I help manage
442;00:36:21,871;00:36:25,341;his affairs.
443;00:36:25,375;00:36:28,778;He's an important person.
443;00:36:25,375;00:36:28,778;So is she.
444;00:36:28,812;00:36:31,346;I grew up in the shadow
444;00:36:28,812;00:36:31,346;of her father's castle.
445;00:36:31,381;00:36:33,382;The day she was born,
445;00:36:31,381;00:36:33,382;they rang the bells
446;00:36:33,416;00:36:35,818;from sunrise till sunset.
447;00:36:38,188;00:36:40,823;We've both done
447;00:36:38,188;00:36:40,823;rather well, you and I.
448;00:36:43,394;00:36:45,161;Yes.
449;00:36:45,195;00:36:48,431;Given where we started.
450;00:36:48,465;00:36:50,700;And where is that?
451;00:36:52,169;00:36:54,236;It's not easy
451;00:36:52,169;00:36:54,236;for girls like us
452;00:36:54,271;00:36:56,439;to dig our way out.
453;00:37:01,211;00:37:03,812;Watch out for her.
454;00:37:03,847;00:37:06,681;I always do.
455;00:37:06,716;00:37:09,417;Watch out for her
455;00:37:06,716;00:37:09,417;with him.
456;00:38:01,706;00:38:03,808;They're growing fast.
457;00:38:07,012;00:38:08,545;Not fast enough.
458;00:38:09,714;00:38:11,983;I can't wait that long.
459;00:38:15,220;00:38:16,855;I need an army.
460;00:38:18,224;00:38:20,658;We'll be in Astapor
460;00:38:18,224;00:38:20,658;by nightfall.
461;00:38:22,561;00:38:24,729;Some say the Unsullied are the
461;00:38:22,561;00:38:24,729;greatest soldiers in the world.
462;00:38:24,764;00:38:27,566;The greatest slave-soldiers
462;00:38:24,764;00:38:27,566;in the world.
463;00:38:27,600;00:38:29,902;The distinction means
463;00:38:27,600;00:38:29,902;a good deal to some people.
464;00:38:29,936;00:38:31,770;Do those people
464;00:38:29,936;00:38:31,770;have any better ideas
465;00:38:31,804;00:38:35,073;about how to put you
465;00:38:31,804;00:38:35,073;on the Iron Throne?
466;00:38:36,775;00:38:38,610;It's too beautiful
466;00:38:36,775;00:38:38,610;a day to argue.
467;00:38:42,214;00:38:43,948;You're right.
468;00:38:46,651;00:38:49,153;Another lovely day
468;00:38:46,651;00:38:49,153;on the high seas.
469;00:38:49,187;00:38:50,954;Don't mock them.
470;00:38:50,989;00:38:53,357;They're the first Dothraki
470;00:38:50,989;00:38:53,357;who have ever been on a ship.
471;00:38:53,424;00:38:55,759;They followed me
471;00:38:53,424;00:38:55,759;across the poison water.
472;00:38:55,793;00:38:57,094;If they'll do it,
472;00:38:55,793;00:38:57,094;others will.
473;00:38:57,128;00:38:58,661;And with a true
473;00:38:57,128;00:38:58,661;khalasar--
474;00:38:58,696;00:39:02,799;The Dothraki follow strength
474;00:38:58,696;00:39:02,799;above all, khaleesi.
475;00:39:02,834;00:39:06,602;You'll have a true khalasar
475;00:39:02,834;00:39:06,602;when you prove yourself strong.
476;00:39:06,637;00:39:08,838;And not before.
477;00:39:36,099;00:39:37,666;Your Grace.
478;00:39:48,679;00:39:51,248;I heard you were dead.
479;00:39:51,282;00:39:53,150;Not yet.
480;00:39:55,286;00:39:58,155;I had hoped to speak
480;00:39:55,286;00:39:58,155;to you alone, Your Grace.
481;00:39:59,224;00:40:01,225;We are alone.
482;00:40:11,237;00:40:14,406;Your Grace, you are
482;00:40:11,237;00:40:14,406;the rightful king.
483;00:40:14,440;00:40:17,309;Not only by blood.
484;00:40:17,343;00:40:20,312;You're an honorable man,
484;00:40:17,343;00:40:20,312;a just man.
485;00:40:20,346;00:40:22,648;And there is still
485;00:40:20,346;00:40:22,648;a war to fight.
486;00:40:22,682;00:40:25,383;I am fighting.
487;00:40:25,418;00:40:28,053;By burning
487;00:40:25,418;00:40:28,053;prisoners alive?
488;00:40:30,357;00:40:32,124;How would you punish
488;00:40:30,357;00:40:32,124;the infidels, Ser Davos?
489;00:40:32,159;00:40:34,594;I do not judge people
489;00:40:32,159;00:40:34,594;for the gods they worship.
490;00:40:34,628;00:40:36,729;If I did, I'd have
490;00:40:34,628;00:40:36,729;thrown you in the sea
491;00:40:36,763;00:40:39,498;before you ever set foot
491;00:40:36,763;00:40:39,498;on Dragonstone.
492;00:40:39,599;00:40:42,234;I'm not your enemy.
492;00:40:39,599;00:40:42,234;You are my enemy.
493;00:40:46,173;00:40:48,574;Was it me you fought
493;00:40:46,173;00:40:48,574;on Blackwater Bay?
494;00:40:49,877;00:40:52,378;Did I set
494;00:40:49,877;00:40:52,378;your ships ablaze?
495;00:40:55,883;00:41:00,020;I wasn't there when the wildfire
495;00:40:55,883;00:41:00,020;killed our men by the thousands.
496;00:41:02,023;00:41:04,692;I could have
496;00:41:02,023;00:41:04,692;saved those men.
497;00:41:04,726;00:41:06,360;You would have
497;00:41:04,726;00:41:06,360;taken the city,
498;00:41:06,428;00:41:08,269;Stannis would now sit
498;00:41:06,428;00:41:08,269;upon his rightful throne,
499;00:41:08,297;00:41:09,965;and you would
499;00:41:08,297;00:41:09,965;stand beside him.
500;00:41:09,999;00:41:12,534;But I wasn't there
501;00:41:12,568;00:41:16,238;because you convinced
501;00:41:12,568;00:41:16,238;your king to leave me behind.
502;00:41:24,414;00:41:27,449;Do you hear them screaming?
503;00:41:27,483;00:41:30,786;All those burning men
503;00:41:27,483;00:41:30,786;in the water
504;00:41:30,820;00:41:33,488;crying for their mothers,
505;00:41:33,523;00:41:36,391;for their gods for help?
506;00:41:36,425;00:41:39,160;Until the moment
506;00:41:36,425;00:41:39,160;the Blackwater swallowed them.
507;00:41:46,034;00:41:48,435;Don't despair, Ser Davos.
508;00:41:48,469;00:41:50,837;What I told
508;00:41:48,469;00:41:50,837;your son is true.
509;00:41:50,871;00:41:53,239;Death by fire
510;00:41:53,274;00:41:54,975;is the purest death.
511;00:41:56,878;00:41:59,112;This woman is evil!
512;00:41:59,180;00:42:00,814;She's the mother of demons.
513;00:42:00,848;00:42:03,683;Take him to the dungeon
513;00:42:00,848;00:42:03,683;and lock him in a cell.
514;00:42:03,718;00:42:05,218;Your Grace!
514;00:42:03,718;00:42:05,218;Come on.
515;00:42:05,253;00:42:06,520;You've chosen
515;00:42:05,253;00:42:06,520;the darkness, Ser Davos.
516;00:42:06,554;00:42:09,422;She will destroy us all!
516;00:42:06,554;00:42:09,422;I will pray for you.
517;00:42:09,490;00:42:11,458;Your Grace!
518;00:42:38,919;00:42:41,521;Halt. Down.
519;00:42:42,690;00:42:45,592;Halt. Down.
520;00:42:51,700;00:42:53,067;Why have we stopped?
521;00:42:53,101;00:42:54,635;It's Lady Margaery,
521;00:42:53,101;00:42:54,635;Your Grace.
522;00:42:59,941;00:43:01,809;What is she doing?
522;00:42:59,941;00:43:01,809;Who gave her permission?
523;00:43:01,843;00:43:05,746;My lady. We should have
523;00:43:01,843;00:43:05,746;guards, my lady.
524;00:43:05,781;00:43:08,149;Why?
525;00:43:11,287;00:43:13,054;Pardon me.
526;00:43:20,063;00:43:23,499;Stop, my lady.
526;00:43:20,063;00:43:23,499;You'll ruin your dress.
527;00:43:23,533;00:43:25,334;I have others.
528;00:43:31,141;00:43:33,542;Would you like to speak
528;00:43:31,141;00:43:33,542;with her, Your Grace?
529;00:43:36,513;00:43:38,814;No.
530;00:43:38,882;00:43:40,582;He was a soldier.
531;00:43:40,617;00:43:42,517;He went to fight
531;00:43:40,617;00:43:42,517;on the walls
532;00:43:42,552;00:43:45,120;when the ships came
532;00:43:42,552;00:43:45,120;into Blackwater Bay.
533;00:43:45,154;00:43:47,222;He never came back.
534;00:43:47,256;00:43:49,057;And your mother?
535;00:43:49,091;00:43:51,492;She died
535;00:43:49,091;00:43:51,492;when she had me.
536;00:43:54,063;00:43:56,331;Bad men wanted
536;00:43:54,063;00:43:56,331;to come into this city
537;00:43:56,365;00:44:00,034;and do terrible things,
537;00:43:56,365;00:44:00,034;but your father stopped them.
538;00:44:06,041;00:44:08,043;Whenever you look
538;00:44:06,041;00:44:08,043;at this knight,
539;00:44:08,077;00:44:10,912;I want you to remember
539;00:44:08,077;00:44:10,912;your father.
540;00:44:13,582;00:44:15,382;He wasn't a knight.
541;00:44:15,417;00:44:17,351;He was just a soldier.
542;00:44:17,385;00:44:19,753;And what do knights
542;00:44:17,385;00:44:19,753;swear to do?
543;00:44:19,787;00:44:23,122;Protect the weak
543;00:44:19,787;00:44:23,122;and uphold the good.
544;00:44:23,157;00:44:26,892;Your father did that.
544;00:44:23,157;00:44:26,892;Be proud of him.
545;00:44:29,629;00:44:32,798;Was your father
545;00:44:29,629;00:44:32,798;a soldier, too?
546;00:44:33,866;00:44:36,735;You should be proud, too.
547;00:44:38,605;00:44:40,906;Under King Joffrey's
547;00:44:38,605;00:44:40,906;leadership,
548;00:44:40,940;00:44:43,675;your fathers
548;00:44:40,940;00:44:43,675;saved the city.
549;00:44:43,710;00:44:46,011;They saved us all.
550;00:44:46,045;00:44:49,415;From now on, we're going
550;00:44:46,045;00:44:49,415;to take care of you.
551;00:44:51,818;00:44:53,852;All of you.
552;00:45:00,659;00:45:02,660;Come to me for whatever
552;00:45:00,659;00:45:02,660;you need to feed them,
553;00:45:02,695;00:45:04,762;clothe them,
553;00:45:02,695;00:45:04,762;or house them.
554;00:45:06,565;00:45:08,665;Directly to me.
555;00:45:23,414;00:45:25,582;Your Grace.
555;00:45:23,414;00:45:25,582;Your Grace.
556;00:45:25,617;00:45:27,217;Please, sit.
556;00:45:25,617;00:45:27,217;Sit.
557;00:45:27,252;00:45:29,720;I do apologize,
557;00:45:27,252;00:45:29,720;my lady.
558;00:45:29,754;00:45:32,090;Small council meetings.
559;00:45:32,124;00:45:34,225;At what point
559;00:45:32,124;00:45:34,225;does it become treason
560;00:45:34,259;00:45:36,127;to waste the king's time?
561;00:45:40,834;00:45:42,568;That's a lovely gown,
561;00:45:40,834;00:45:42,568;my lady.
562;00:45:42,603;00:45:44,604;Yes, it suits you
562;00:45:42,603;00:45:44,604;perfectly.
563;00:45:44,638;00:45:47,040;I imagine you might
563;00:45:44,638;00:45:47,040;be rather cold.
564;00:45:47,074;00:45:50,444;The climate is a bit more forgiving
564;00:45:47,074;00:45:50,444;back in Highgarden, Your Grace.
565;00:45:50,478;00:45:54,180;Shall I have them bring
565;00:45:50,478;00:45:54,180;you a shawl, my lady?
566;00:45:54,215;00:45:56,683;I am touched by your
566;00:45:54,215;00:45:56,683;concern, Your Grace.
567;00:45:56,718;00:45:59,920;Luckily for us Tyrells,
567;00:45:56,718;00:45:59,920;our blood runs quite warm.
568;00:45:59,954;00:46:01,922;Doesn't it, Loras?
568;00:45:59,954;00:46:01,922;Yes.
569;00:46:01,956;00:46:05,059;Loras, isn't the queen's
569;00:46:01,956;00:46:05,059;gown magnificent?
570;00:46:05,093;00:46:07,961;The fabric, the embroidery,
570;00:46:05,093;00:46:07,961;the metalwork.
571;00:46:07,996;00:46:09,630;I've never seen
571;00:46:07,996;00:46:09,630;anything like it.
572;00:46:09,664;00:46:11,565;You might find a bit
572;00:46:09,664;00:46:11,565;of armor quite useful
573;00:46:11,599;00:46:14,201;once you become queen.
573;00:46:11,599;00:46:14,201;Perhaps before.
574;00:46:14,235;00:46:18,038;Joffrey tells me you stopped
574;00:46:14,235;00:46:18,038;your carriage at Flea Bottom
575;00:46:18,072;00:46:19,840;on your way back from
575;00:46:18,072;00:46:19,840;the sept this morning.
576;00:46:19,874;00:46:24,244;Yes. I paid a visit
576;00:46:19,874;00:46:24,244;to an orphanage
577;00:46:24,278;00:46:25,812;the High Septon
577;00:46:24,278;00:46:25,812;told me about.
578;00:46:25,846;00:46:28,527;Margaery does a great deal of work
578;00:46:25,846;00:46:28,527;with the poor back in Highgarden.
579;00:46:28,549;00:46:32,853;The lowest among us are no different from
579;00:46:28,549;00:46:32,853;the highest if you give them a chance
580;00:46:32,887;00:46:35,156;and approach them
580;00:46:32,887;00:46:35,156;with an open heart.
581;00:46:35,223;00:46:37,258;An open heart is what
581;00:46:35,223;00:46:37,258;you'll get in Flea Bottom
582;00:46:37,292;00:46:38,859;if you're not careful,
582;00:46:37,292;00:46:38,859;my dear.
583;00:46:38,893;00:46:42,729;Not long ago, we were
583;00:46:38,893;00:46:42,729;attacked by a mob there.
584;00:46:42,797;00:46:45,699;We had a full complement
584;00:46:42,797;00:46:45,699;of guards that didn't stop them.
585;00:46:45,733;00:46:48,702;The king barely escaped
585;00:46:45,733;00:46:48,702;with his life.
586;00:46:48,736;00:46:52,206;My mother's always had
586;00:46:48,736;00:46:52,206;a penchant for drama.
587;00:46:52,273;00:46:54,809;Facts become less and less
587;00:46:52,273;00:46:54,809;important to her
588;00:46:54,843;00:46:56,844;as she grows older.
589;00:46:56,912;00:46:59,814;Our lives were never
589;00:46:56,912;00:46:59,814;truly in danger.
590;00:47:01,049;00:47:02,783;You're right, of course.
591;00:47:02,818;00:47:06,053;But you are
591;00:47:02,818;00:47:06,053;your father's son.
592;00:47:06,088;00:47:08,255;We can't all have
592;00:47:06,088;00:47:08,255;a king's bravery.
593;00:47:16,432;00:47:18,633;Hunger turns men
593;00:47:16,432;00:47:18,633;into beasts.
594;00:47:18,667;00:47:22,504;I'm glad House Tyrell has been
594;00:47:18,667;00:47:22,504;able to help in this regard.
595;00:47:22,539;00:47:26,375;They tell me 100 wagons arrive
595;00:47:22,539;00:47:26,375;daily now from the Reach.
596;00:47:26,410;00:47:29,912;Wheat, barley, apples.
596;00:47:26,410;00:47:29,912;We've had a blessed harvest.
597;00:47:29,947;00:47:32,615;And, of course, it's our
597;00:47:29,947;00:47:32,615;duty to assist the capital
598;00:47:32,649;00:47:34,684;in time of need.
599;00:47:34,718;00:47:36,419;Well, as Ser Loras said,
600;00:47:36,453;00:47:39,589;Lady Margaery has done
600;00:47:36,453;00:47:39,589;this sort of...
601;00:47:39,623;00:47:41,557;charitable work before.
602;00:47:42,693;00:47:44,727;I'm sure she knows
602;00:47:42,693;00:47:44,727;what she's doing.
603;00:47:46,096;00:47:48,131;I'm sure she does.
604;00:48:16,561;00:48:19,363;The Unsullied have stood here
604;00:48:16,561;00:48:19,363;for a day and a night
605;00:48:19,398;00:48:21,533;with no food or water.
606;00:48:27,841;00:48:29,775;They will stand
606;00:48:27,841;00:48:29,775;until they drop.
607;00:48:32,112;00:48:34,012;Such is their
607;00:48:32,112;00:48:34,012;obedience.
608;00:48:36,049;00:48:38,117;They may suit my needs.
609;00:48:38,151;00:48:40,119;Tell me of their training.
610;00:49:00,408;00:49:02,976;They begin their
610;00:49:00,408;00:49:02,976;training at five.
611;00:49:03,010;00:49:04,978;Every day they drill
611;00:49:03,010;00:49:04,978;from dawn to dusk
612;00:49:05,013;00:49:07,181;until they have mastered
612;00:49:05,013;00:49:07,181;the shortsword,
613;00:49:07,215;00:49:09,616;the shield,
613;00:49:07,215;00:49:09,616;and the three spears.
614;00:49:09,651;00:49:13,254;Only one boy in four survives
614;00:49:09,651;00:49:13,254;this rigorous training.
615;00:49:15,457;00:49:19,326;Their discipline
615;00:49:15,457;00:49:19,326;and loyalty are absolute.
616;00:49:19,360;00:49:21,128;They fear nothing.
617;00:49:21,162;00:49:24,197;Even the bravest men
617;00:49:21,162;00:49:24,197;fear death.
618;00:49:45,353;00:49:48,322;My master says
618;00:49:45,353;00:49:48,322;the Unsullied are not men.
619;00:49:48,356;00:49:50,724;Death means nothing
619;00:49:48,356;00:49:50,724;to them.
620;00:49:59,233;00:50:02,201;He begs you attend to this
620;00:49:59,233;00:50:02,201;carefully, Your Grace.
621;00:50:16,849;00:50:18,851;Tell the good master
621;00:50:16,849;00:50:18,851;there is no need.
622;00:50:26,626;00:50:29,594;My master points out
622;00:50:26,626;00:50:29,594;that men don't need nipples.
623;00:50:45,412;00:50:47,580;To win his shield,
624;00:50:47,614;00:50:51,350;an Unsullied must go to the
624;00:50:47,614;00:50:51,350;slave marts with a silver mark,
625;00:50:51,384;00:50:56,355;find a newborn and kill it
625;00:50:51,384;00:50:56,355;before its mother's eyes.
626;00:50:58,692;00:51:01,126;This way, my master says,
626;00:50:58,692;00:51:01,126;we make certain
627;00:51:01,161;00:51:03,262;there is no weakness
627;00:51:01,161;00:51:03,262;left in them.
628;00:51:04,598;00:51:07,400;You take a babe
628;00:51:04,598;00:51:07,400;from its mother's arms,
629;00:51:07,434;00:51:11,737;kill it as she watches, and pay
629;00:51:07,434;00:51:11,737;for her pain with a silver coin?
630;00:51:25,652;00:51:28,253;My master would like you to
630;00:51:25,652;00:51:28,253;know that the silver is paid
631;00:51:28,288;00:51:30,856;to the baby's owner,
631;00:51:28,288;00:51:30,856;not the mother.
632;00:51:36,997;00:51:38,964;How many do you
632;00:51:36,997;00:51:38,964;have to sell?
633;00:51:44,305;00:51:46,273;8,000.
634;00:51:50,912;00:51:53,548;Master Kraznys asks
634;00:51:50,912;00:51:53,548;that you please hurry.
635;00:51:53,582;00:51:56,417;Many other buyers
635;00:51:53,582;00:51:56,417;are interested.
636;00:52:06,561;00:52:09,730;8,000 dead babies.
637;00:52:09,765;00:52:12,333;The Unsullied
637;00:52:09,765;00:52:12,333;are a means to an end.
638;00:52:12,367;00:52:14,702;Once I own them,
638;00:52:12,367;00:52:14,702;these men--
639;00:52:14,770;00:52:17,271;They're not men.
639;00:52:14,770;00:52:17,271;Not anymore.
640;00:52:17,305;00:52:20,674;Once I own an army of
640;00:52:17,305;00:52:20,674;slaves, what will I be?
641;00:52:20,708;00:52:22,776;Do you think these slaves
641;00:52:20,708;00:52:22,776;will have better lives
642;00:52:22,810;00:52:26,246;serving Kraznys and men
642;00:52:22,810;00:52:26,246;like him or serving you?
643;00:52:39,960;00:52:41,460;You'll be fair to them.
644;00:52:41,495;00:52:44,263;You won't mutilate them
644;00:52:41,495;00:52:44,263;to make a point.
645;00:52:48,836;00:52:51,037;You won't order them
645;00:52:48,836;00:52:51,037;to murder babies.
646;00:52:51,072;00:52:53,907;You'll see they're properly
646;00:52:51,072;00:52:53,907;fed and sheltered.
647;00:52:53,941;00:52:56,776;A great injustice
647;00:52:53,941;00:52:56,776;has been done to them.
648;00:52:57,946;00:53:00,480;Closing your eyes
648;00:52:57,946;00:53:00,480;will not undo it.
649;00:53:57,269;00:53:59,204;The warlocks.
650;00:54:02,676;00:54:05,545;I owe you my life, ser.
651;00:54:05,579;00:54:07,214;The honor is mine,

654;00:54:15,122;00:54:16,923;I know him
655;00:54:16,957;00:54:21,428;as one of the greatest fighters
655;00:54:16,957;00:54:21,428;the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen
656;00:54:21,462;00:54:23,030;and as the Lord Commander
657;00:54:23,064;00:54:25,832;of Robert Baratheon's

662;00:54:39,581;00:54:41,515;I failed them.
