1;00:00:11,330;00:00:12,539;I lost this dagger.
2;00:00:12,873;00:00:13,873;To whom?
3;00:00:14,497;00:00:15,664;Tyrion Lannister.
4;00:00:17,456;00:00:19,456;Take a step toward a more
4;00:00:17,456;00:00:19,456;productive relationship
5;00:00:19,456;00:00:20,456;with a possible ally.
6;00:00:20,664;00:00:22,664;I will allow you to mine
6;00:00:20,664;00:00:22,664;the dragonglass
7;00:00:22,664;00:00:23,914;and forge weapons from it.
8;00:00:23,914;00:00:24,914;Thank you.
9;00:00:25,873;00:00:28,789;She has three
9;00:00:25,873;00:00:28,789;full-grown dragons, Your Grace.
10;00:00:29,372;00:00:31,122;How do you propose to stop them?
11;00:00:31,539;00:00:34,039;We are currently at work
11;00:00:31,539;00:00:34,039;on a solution.
12;00:00:39,664;00:00:41,664;I thought
12;00:00:39,664;00:00:41,664;you'd be heading for Winterfell.
13;00:00:41,873;00:00:43,414;Jon Snow came down
13;00:00:41,873;00:00:43,414;from Castle Black
14;00:00:43,414;00:00:45,614;with a wildling army and won
14;00:00:43,414;00:00:45,614;the Battle of the Bastards.
15;00:00:45,789;00:00:46,873;He's King in the North now.
16;00:00:49,289;00:00:50,489;Your sister's dead.
17;00:00:51,039;00:00:52,080;Euron has her.
18;00:00:52,080;00:00:54,706;I couldn't save her.
18;00:00:52,080;00:00:54,706;I tried.
19;00:00:55,289;00:00:57,205;You wouldn't be here
19;00:00:55,289;00:00:57,205;if you'd tried.
20;00:00:58,706;00:00:59,873;What about Casterly Rock?
21;00:01:08,456;00:01:11,039;We both know
21;00:01:08,456;00:01:11,039;how expensive war can be.
22;00:01:11,205;00:01:12,539;Your vaults are empty.
23;00:01:12,831;00:01:14,372;My debt will be paid in full.
24;00:01:15,205;00:01:16,372;How will it happen?
25;00:01:16,372;00:01:17,456;Will there be pain?
26;00:01:17,456;00:01:18,873;No. I made sure of that.
27;00:01:19,164;00:01:20,831;I'd hate to die like your son.
28;00:01:21,289;00:01:23,414;Not at all what I intended.
29;00:01:23,873;00:01:24,956;Tell Cersei.
30;00:01:25,330;00:01:26,789;I want her to know it was me.

46;00:04:18,414;00:04:21,247;That's a lot of money
46;00:04:18,414;00:04:21,247;I just gave you.
47;00:04:21,247;00:04:22,581;It's not a castle.
48;00:04:24,247;00:04:26,414;How about that one?
48;00:04:24,247;00:04:26,414;It's available.
49;00:04:26,414;00:04:27,789;You don't want

50;00:04:27,789;00:04:30,581;I beg to differ.
50;00:04:27,789;00:04:30,581;We're at war.
51;00:04:30,581;00:04:33,789;Daenerys Targaryen could come and
51;00:04:30,581;00:04:33,789;take it back the day after you move in.

52;00:04:35,164;00:04:37,039;think of the upkeep.
53;00:04:37,039;00:04:40,080;The more you owe,
53;00:04:37,039;00:04:40,080;the more it weighs you down.

54;00:04:40,080;00:04:42,664;you're so fucking glum, eh?

57;00:04:48,122;00:04:50,873;This all belongs
57;00:04:48,122;00:04:50,873;to the Iron Bank.
58;00:04:50,873;00:04:54,122;See?
58;00:04:50,873;00:04:54,122;We pay our debts.

63;00:05:04,998;00:05:07,456;complaining about
63;00:05:04,998;00:05:07,456;not getting paid.

66;00:05:11,122;00:05:12,581;will be yours

67;00:05:12,581;00:05:13,998;to take them away from you.
68;00:05:13,998;00:05:15,873;Yes, I'm sure
68;00:05:13,998;00:05:15,873;Queen Cersei's reign
69;00:05:15,873;00:05:17,330;will be quiet
69;00:05:15,873;00:05:17,330;and peaceable.
70;00:05:17,330;00:05:18,914;Ah, stranger things
70;00:05:17,330;00:05:18,914;have happened.
71;00:05:18,914;00:05:19,956;Like what?
72;00:05:21,998;00:05:24,956;The granaries are being emptied
72;00:05:21,998;00:05:24,956;and loaded into wagons, my lord.
73;00:05:24,956;00:05:27,789;The current harvest?
73;00:05:24,956;00:05:27,789;We have teams of men collecting it
74;00:05:27,789;00:05:29,456;from all the farms
74;00:05:27,789;00:05:29,456;in the Reach.
75;00:05:29,456;00:05:31,789;Ser Bronn, will you
75;00:05:29,456;00:05:31,789;accompany the Tarlys
76;00:05:31,789;00:05:33,956;and help them
76;00:05:31,789;00:05:33,956;accelerate this process?
77;00:05:33,956;00:05:35,956;I'm not much
77;00:05:33,956;00:05:35,956;for shoveling wheat.
78;00:05:35,956;00:05:41,122;No, but motivating reluctant farmers to
78;00:05:35,956;00:05:41,122;hand over their harvest--
79;00:05:41,122;00:05:43,164;I bet you're going to have
79;00:05:41,122;00:05:43,164;a real talent for that.
80;00:05:45,289;00:05:46,998;My lord.
81;00:05:46,998;00:05:48,122;My lord.
82;00:05:50,330;00:05:51,330;My lord.
83;00:06:01,956;00:06:04,247;I must say,
83;00:06:01,956;00:06:04,247;I don't think the Iron Bank
84;00:06:04,247;00:06:08,998;has ever had a debt of this magnitude
84;00:06:04,247;00:06:08,998;repaid in a single installment.
85;00:06:08,998;00:06:13,205;I always considered your father
85;00:06:08,998;00:06:13,205;a very effective and efficient man,
86;00:06:13,205;00:06:16,831;but you appear to be
86;00:06:13,205;00:06:16,831;redefining those terms entirely.
87;00:06:16,831;00:06:19,039;You're too kind,
87;00:06:16,831;00:06:19,039;my lord.
88;00:06:19,039;00:06:22,205;I am neither kind
88;00:06:19,039;00:06:22,205;nor a lord, Your Grace.
89;00:06:22,205;00:06:25,372;I am merely an instrument
89;00:06:22,205;00:06:25,372;of the institution I represent.
90;00:06:25,372;00:06:29,122;Its well-being is a matter
90;00:06:25,372;00:06:29,122;of arithmetic, not sentiment.
91;00:06:29,122;00:06:32,205;And the current arithmetic
91;00:06:29,122;00:06:32,205;is outstanding.
92;00:06:33,414;00:06:35,497;Uh, the gold...
92;00:06:33,414;00:06:35,497;Is on its way.
93;00:06:35,497;00:06:39,497;My brother is supervising
93;00:06:35,497;00:06:39,497;its transportation himself.
94;00:06:39,497;00:06:42,414;Some at the Iron Bank
94;00:06:39,497;00:06:42,414;will be disappointed.
95;00:06:42,414;00:06:45,164;They've grown rather fond
95;00:06:42,414;00:06:45,164;of your interest payments.
96;00:06:45,164;00:06:48,414;We must devise a way
96;00:06:45,164;00:06:48,414;to raise their spirits.
97;00:06:48,414;00:06:50,873;Yes, perhaps we could
97;00:06:48,414;00:06:50,873;be of assistance
98;00:06:50,873;00:06:53,664;in some
98;00:06:50,873;00:06:53,664;current venture.
99;00:06:53,664;00:06:55,622;My only venture
99;00:06:53,664;00:06:55,622;at this moment
100;00:06:55,622;00:06:58,289;is reestablishing control
100;00:06:55,622;00:06:58,289;over this continent
101;00:06:58,289;00:07:00,581;and every person on it.
102;00:07:00,581;00:07:03,414;I see a great deal
102;00:07:00,581;00:07:03,414;of potential in that venture.
103;00:07:03,414;00:07:07,372;I imagine it would require
103;00:07:03,414;00:07:07,372;outside investment.
104;00:07:07,372;00:07:08,622;It will, indeed.
105;00:07:08,622;00:07:11,581;I need to expand
105;00:07:08,622;00:07:11,581;my armies, my navies.
106;00:07:11,581;00:07:15,289;My Hand, Qyburn, has made overtures to
106;00:07:11,581;00:07:15,289;the Golden Company in Essos.
107;00:07:15,289;00:07:16,497;I know them well.
108;00:07:16,497;00:07:18,956;They have helped us
108;00:07:16,497;00:07:18,956;recover significant sums
109;00:07:18,956;00:07:21,914;from parties who had
109;00:07:18,956;00:07:21,914;fallen into deep arrears.
110;00:07:21,914;00:07:23,622;That's good to hear.
111;00:07:23,622;00:07:27,039;I, too, would like them to recover
111;00:07:23,622;00:07:27,039;some things that belong to me.
112;00:07:28,456;00:07:30,748;Rest assured,
112;00:07:28,456;00:07:30,748;Your Grace,
113;00:07:30,748;00:07:33,664;you can count on
113;00:07:30,748;00:07:33,664;the Iron Bank's support.
114;00:07:33,664;00:07:36,706;Hmm.
114;00:07:33,664;00:07:36,706;As soon as the gold arrives.
115;00:07:40,456;00:07:41,789;This is for you.
116;00:07:46,581;00:07:49,289;The last man who wielded it
116;00:07:46,581;00:07:49,289;meant to cut your throat,
117;00:07:49,289;00:07:51,122;but your mother
117;00:07:49,289;00:07:51,122;fought him off.
118;00:07:59,914;00:08:01,956;The other dagger,
119;00:08:01,956;00:08:04,622;the one that
119;00:08:01,956;00:08:04,622;took her life,
120;00:08:04,622;00:08:07,831;I would have stopped that dagger
120;00:08:04,622;00:08:07,831;with my own heart
121;00:08:07,831;00:08:09,247;if I could have.
122;00:08:11,330;00:08:13,956;I wasn't there for her
122;00:08:11,330;00:08:13,956;when she needed me most.
123;00:08:15,664;00:08:18,664;But I am here
123;00:08:15,664;00:08:18,664;for her now
124;00:08:18,664;00:08:21,372;to do what she
124;00:08:18,664;00:08:21,372;would have done,
125;00:08:21,372;00:08:23,330;to protect
125;00:08:21,372;00:08:23,330;her children.
126;00:08:25,914;00:08:29,831;Anything I can do
126;00:08:25,914;00:08:29,831;for you, Brandon,
127;00:08:29,831;00:08:32,164;you need only ask.
128;00:08:34,664;00:08:37,372;Do you know
128;00:08:34,664;00:08:37,372;who this belonged to?
129;00:08:37,372;00:08:40,080;No.
130;00:08:40,080;00:08:43,914;That very question was
130;00:08:40,080;00:08:43,914;what started the War of the Five Kings.
131;00:08:43,914;00:08:48,330;In a way, that dagger made you
131;00:08:43,914;00:08:48,330;what you are today.
132;00:08:48,330;00:08:50,205;Forced from your home,
133;00:08:50,205;00:08:52,706;driven out to the wilds
133;00:08:50,205;00:08:52,706;beyond the Wall.
134;00:08:52,706;00:08:57,456;I imagine you've seen things
134;00:08:52,706;00:08:57,456;most men wouldn't believe.
135;00:09:06,914;00:09:10,039;To go through all of that
135;00:09:06,914;00:09:10,039;and make your way home again
136;00:09:10,039;00:09:14,664;only to find such chaos
136;00:09:10,039;00:09:14,664;in the world,
137;00:09:14,664;00:09:15,706;I can only imagine--
138;00:09:15,706;00:09:17,664;Chaos is a ladder.
139;00:09:30,039;00:09:32,956;I'm sorry to have
139;00:09:30,039;00:09:32,956;disturbed you, Lord Stark.
140;00:09:32,956;00:09:34,372;I'm not Lord Stark.
141;00:09:45,748;00:09:47,873;What's that?
142;00:09:47,873;00:09:49,873;Maester Wolkan
142;00:09:47,873;00:09:49,873;built it for me
143;00:09:49,873;00:09:51,414;so I can move around
143;00:09:49,873;00:09:51,414;more easily.
144;00:09:51,414;00:09:53,247;It's a very good idea.
145;00:09:56,080;00:09:57,956;You're leaving.
146;00:09:59,247;00:10:00,914;I don't want
146;00:09:59,247;00:10:00,914;to leave you,
147;00:10:00,914;00:10:03,914;but when--
147;00:10:00,914;00:10:03,914;when they come,
148;00:10:03,914;00:10:05,622;I need to be
148;00:10:03,914;00:10:05,622;with my family.
149;00:10:06,831;00:10:08,706;And you're safe.
150;00:10:08,706;00:10:10,581;Well, as safe
150;00:10:08,706;00:10:10,581;as anyone can be now.
151;00:10:11,706;00:10:13,914;You don't
151;00:10:11,706;00:10:13,914;need me anymore.
152;00:10:14,998;00:10:16,539;No, I don't.
153;00:10:20,998;00:10:22,118;That's all
153;00:10:20,998;00:10:22,118;you've got to say?
154;00:10:23,748;00:10:25,164;Thank you.
155;00:10:26,622;00:10:28,622;Thank you?
156;00:10:28,622;00:10:30,289;For helping me.
157;00:10:32,205;00:10:34,414;My brother
157;00:10:32,205;00:10:34,414;died for you.
158;00:10:34,414;00:10:37,122;Hodor and Summer
158;00:10:34,414;00:10:37,122;died for you.
159;00:10:37,122;00:10:39,456;I almost died for you.
160;00:10:43,289;00:10:46,289;Bran...
160;00:10:43,289;00:10:46,289;I'm not, really.
161;00:10:48,247;00:10:49,789;Not anymore.
162;00:10:51,956;00:10:55,247;I remember what it felt like
162;00:10:51,956;00:10:55,247;to be Brandon Stark,
163;00:10:55,247;00:10:58,748;but I remember
163;00:10:55,247;00:10:58,748;so much else now.
164;00:11:05,873;00:11:07,456;You died in that cave.
165;00:11:45,831;00:11:47,247;I did.
166;00:11:47,247;00:11:49,664;The kitchen girl,
166;00:11:47,247;00:11:49,664;the redhead with the behind.
167;00:11:49,664;00:11:54,330;The only thing in the kitchen
167;00:11:49,664;00:11:54,330;that you've put your cock in is the liver.
168;00:11:54,330;00:11:57,664;'Ey up.
168;00:11:54,330;00:11:57,664;Where you going?
169;00:11:57,664;00:12:00,205;In there.
169;00:11:57,664;00:12:00,205;I live here.
170;00:12:00,205;00:12:01,914;Fuck off.
171;00:12:01,914;00:12:03,998;I'm Arya Stark.
171;00:12:01,914;00:12:03,998;This is my home.
172;00:12:07,873;00:12:09,497;Arya Stark's dead.
173;00:12:12,205;00:12:14,330;Send for Maester Luwin
173;00:12:12,205;00:12:14,330;or Ser Rodrick.
174;00:12:14,330;00:12:17,372;They'll tell you who I am.
174;00:12:14,330;00:12:17,372;There's no Rodrick here.
175;00:12:17,372;00:12:19,205;Maester's named Wolkan.
176;00:12:19,205;00:12:22,372;Go ask Jon Snow, then,
176;00:12:19,205;00:12:22,372;the King in the North.
177;00:12:22,372;00:12:24,914;He's my brother.
177;00:12:22,372;00:12:24,914;He's a thousand miles away.
178;00:12:24,914;00:12:27,706;Look, it's cold
178;00:12:24,914;00:12:27,706;and we're busy,
179;00:12:27,706;00:12:31,080;so, you know, best fuck off.
179;00:12:27,706;00:12:31,080;Mm.
180;00:12:31,080;00:12:33,956;If Jon's gone,
180;00:12:31,080;00:12:33,956;who's in charge of Winterfell?
181;00:12:35,289;00:12:39,122;The Lady of Winterfell.
181;00:12:35,289;00:12:39,122;Lady Stark.
182;00:12:39,122;00:12:40,831;Which Lady Stark?
182;00:12:39,122;00:12:40,831;You tell us.
183;00:12:40,831;00:12:42,581;You're the one
183;00:12:40,831;00:12:42,581;impersonating her sister.
184;00:12:46,289;00:12:48,414;Tell Sansa
184;00:12:46,289;00:12:48,414;her sister's home.
185;00:12:48,414;00:12:52,748;Lady Sansa is too busy
185;00:12:48,414;00:12:52,748;to waste her breath on you, just like us.
186;00:12:52,748;00:12:56,080;So, for the last time,
186;00:12:52,748;00:12:56,080;fuck off.
187;00:13:00,330;00:13:03,205;I'm getting into this castle
187;00:13:00,330;00:13:03,205;one way or another.
188;00:13:03,205;00:13:06,706;If I'm not who I say I am,
188;00:13:03,205;00:13:06,706;I won't last long.
189;00:13:06,706;00:13:10,748;But if I am and Sansa finds out
189;00:13:06,706;00:13:10,748;you turned me away...
190;00:13:18,330;00:13:20,956;Right, you sit there.
191;00:13:20,956;00:13:23,164;Right there.
192;00:13:23,164;00:13:24,164;Don't move.
193;00:13:25,789;00:13:28,122;Right, go tell Lady Stark.
193;00:13:25,789;00:13:28,122;I'll watch her.
194;00:13:28,122;00:13:31,456;I ain't telling Lady Stark.
194;00:13:28,122;00:13:31,456;You can tell her.
195;00:13:31,456;00:13:32,831;Why me?
196;00:13:58,039;00:14:00,080;You're gonna tell her.
196;00:13:58,039;00:14:00,080;I'm not.
197;00:14:00,080;00:14:02,998;'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna hit
197;00:14:00,080;00:14:02,998;you right in the fucking face
198;00:14:02,998;00:14:04,372;as hard as I can.
199;00:14:12,664;00:14:14,122;We told her to wait.
200;00:14:14,122;00:14:16,873;We were standing
200;00:14:14,122;00:14:16,873;right next to her, and...
201;00:14:16,873;00:14:18,998;And-- and when we turned around,
201;00:14:16,873;00:14:18,998;she'd gone, my lady.
202;00:14:18,998;00:14:20,873;She-- she was nothing.
202;00:14:18,998;00:14:20,873;Some winter town girl.
203;00:14:20,873;00:14:23,664;She comes in asking
203;00:14:20,873;00:14:23,664;for, uh, Ser Rodrick...
204;00:14:23,664;00:14:26,164;Rodrick, yeah. Luwin, yeah.
204;00:14:23,664;00:14:26,164;...and Maester Luwin.
205;00:14:26,164;00:14:28,581;And don't trouble
205;00:14:26,164;00:14:28,581;yourself over it, my lady.
206;00:14:28,581;00:14:31,789;We'll-- we'll find her.
206;00:14:28,581;00:14:31,789;You don't have to.
207;00:14:31,789;00:14:33,289;I know where she is.
208;00:14:49,622;00:14:51,831;Do I have to call you
208;00:14:49,622;00:14:51,831;Lady Stark now?
209;00:14:53,914;00:14:55,539;Yes.
210;00:15:12,622;00:15:14,956;You shouldn't have run
210;00:15:12,622;00:15:14,956;from the guards.
211;00:15:14,956;00:15:16,998;I didn't run.
212;00:15:16,998;00:15:18,372;You need better guards.
213;00:15:25,080;00:15:28,205;It suits you...
213;00:15:25,080;00:15:28,205;Lady Stark.
214;00:15:29,372;00:15:31,247;Jon left you
214;00:15:29,372;00:15:31,247;in charge?
215;00:15:31,247;00:15:32,622;He did.
216;00:15:34,039;00:15:36,539;I hope
216;00:15:34,039;00:15:36,539;he comes back soon.
217;00:15:36,539;00:15:38,372;I remember how happy
217;00:15:36,539;00:15:38,372;he was to see me.
218;00:15:38,372;00:15:41,706;When he sees you,
218;00:15:38,372;00:15:41,706;his heart will probably stop.
219;00:15:51,581;00:15:53,789;It doesn't look
219;00:15:51,581;00:15:53,789;like him.
220;00:15:53,789;00:15:57,080;Should've been carved
220;00:15:53,789;00:15:57,080;by someone who knew his face.
221;00:15:57,080;00:16:00,080;Everyone who knew
221;00:15:57,080;00:16:00,080;his face is dead.
222;00:16:02,414;00:16:03,581;We're not.
223;00:16:09,247;00:16:11,330;They say
223;00:16:09,247;00:16:11,330;you killed Joffrey.
224;00:16:11,330;00:16:13,622;Did you?
225;00:16:13,622;00:16:15,289;I wish I had.
226;00:16:15,289;00:16:18,330;Hmm.
226;00:16:15,289;00:16:18,330;Me, too.
227;00:16:18,330;00:16:20,956;I was angry when I heard
227;00:16:18,330;00:16:20,956;someone else had done it.
228;00:16:22,956;00:16:25,622;However long my list got,
228;00:16:22,956;00:16:25,622;he was always first.
229;00:16:25,622;00:16:27,539;Your list?
230;00:16:27,539;00:16:29,748;Of people
230;00:16:27,539;00:16:29,748;I'm going to kill.
231;00:16:39,622;00:16:42,372;How did you get back
231;00:16:39,622;00:16:42,372;to Winterfell?
232;00:16:42,372;00:16:44,205;It's a long story.
233;00:16:44,205;00:16:46,289;I imagine
233;00:16:44,205;00:16:46,289;yours is, too.
234;00:16:46,289;00:16:48,247;Yes.
235;00:16:48,247;00:16:50,372;Not a very
235;00:16:48,247;00:16:50,372;pleasant one.
236;00:16:50,372;00:16:52,372;Mine neither.
237;00:16:55,748;00:16:58,122;But our stories
237;00:16:55,748;00:16:58,122;aren't over yet.
238;00:16:58,122;00:17:00,998;No, they're not.
239;00:17:08,122;00:17:09,497;Arya...
240;00:17:13,080;00:17:14,205;Bran's home, too.
241;00:17:52,539;00:17:53,873;You came home.
242;00:18:07,748;00:18:09,748;I saw you
242;00:18:07,748;00:18:09,748;at the crossroads.
243;00:18:11,581;00:18:12,914;You saw me?
244;00:18:12,914;00:18:15,414;I see quite a lot now.
245;00:18:15,414;00:18:20,247;Bran has... visions.
246;00:18:20,247;00:18:22,414;I thought you might go
246;00:18:20,247;00:18:22,414;to King's Landing.
247;00:18:22,414;00:18:24,664;So did I.
248;00:18:24,664;00:18:26,539;Why would you
248;00:18:24,664;00:18:26,539;go back there?
249;00:18:26,539;00:18:29,122;Cersei's on
249;00:18:26,539;00:18:29,122;her list of names.
250;00:18:40,664;00:18:42,539;Who else
250;00:18:40,664;00:18:42,539;is on your list?
251;00:18:42,539;00:18:44,289;Most of them
251;00:18:42,539;00:18:44,289;are dead already.
252;00:18:55,414;00:18:57,748;Where did
252;00:18:55,414;00:18:57,748;you get this?
253;00:18:57,748;00:18:59,164;Littlefinger
253;00:18:57,748;00:18:59,164;gave it to me.
254;00:19:00,456;00:19:02,706;Littlefinger?
254;00:19:00,456;00:19:02,706;He's here?
255;00:19:02,706;00:19:04,581;He has declared
255;00:19:02,706;00:19:04,581;for House Stark.
256;00:19:04,581;00:19:06,456;Why would he
256;00:19:04,581;00:19:06,456;give you a dagger?
257;00:19:06,456;00:19:08,956;He thought I'd want it.
257;00:19:06,456;00:19:08,956;Why?
258;00:19:08,956;00:19:10,664;Because it was
258;00:19:08,956;00:19:10,664;meant to kill me.
259;00:19:10,664;00:19:15,539;The cutthroat...
259;00:19:10,664;00:19:15,539;after your fall?
260;00:19:15,539;00:19:18,414;Why would a cutthroat
260;00:19:15,539;00:19:18,414;have a Valyrian steel dagger?
261;00:19:18,414;00:19:21,456;Someone very wealthy
261;00:19:18,414;00:19:21,456;wanted me dead.
262;00:19:21,456;00:19:22,622;He's not
262;00:19:21,456;00:19:22,622;a generous man.
263;00:19:22,622;00:19:23,998;He wouldn't
263;00:19:22,622;00:19:23,998;give you anything
264;00:19:23,998;00:19:25,914;unless he thought
264;00:19:23,998;00:19:25,914;he was getting something back.
265;00:19:28,289;00:19:31,289;It doesn't matter.
265;00:19:28,289;00:19:31,289;What do you mean it doesn't matter?
266;00:19:31,289;00:19:33,205;I don't want it.
267;00:19:37,497;00:19:38,539;Are you sure?
268;00:19:39,831;00:19:41,247;It's Valyrian steel.
269;00:19:41,247;00:19:43,622;It's wasted
269;00:19:41,247;00:19:43,622;on a cripple.
270;00:20:19,414;00:20:22,914;Catelyn Stark
270;00:20:19,414;00:20:22,914;would be proud.
271;00:20:22,914;00:20:25,289;You kept your vow.
272;00:20:25,289;00:20:26,706;I did
272;00:20:25,289;00:20:26,706;next to nothing.
273;00:20:26,706;00:20:28,622;You're too hard
273;00:20:26,706;00:20:28,622;on yourself, my lady.
274;00:20:28,622;00:20:30,205;I'm not a...
275;00:20:33,372;00:20:34,998;Thank you, Podrick.
276;00:20:52,873;00:20:56,247;Your Grace, there's still
276;00:20:52,873;00:20:56,247;no word from the Unsullied.
277;00:20:56,247;00:20:57,914;Soon.
278;00:20:57,914;00:20:59,748;He will
278;00:20:57,914;00:20:59,748;come back to you.
279;00:21:01,622;00:21:02,956;He'd better.
280;00:21:05,205;00:21:07,914;What happened?
281;00:21:07,914;00:21:09,247;Many things.
282;00:21:12,581;00:21:13,789;Many things?
283;00:21:15,330;00:21:17,372;Your Grace.
284;00:21:45,456;00:21:46,706;I wanted you
284;00:21:45,456;00:21:46,706;to see it
285;00:21:46,706;00:21:49,456;before we start
285;00:21:46,706;00:21:49,456;hacking it to bits.
286;00:22:26,539;00:22:29,372;Well, this is it.
286;00:22:26,539;00:22:29,372;All we'll ever need.
287;00:22:35,414;00:22:38,873;There is something else
287;00:22:35,414;00:22:38,873;I want to show you, Your Grace.
288;00:23:03,998;00:23:06,080;The children
288;00:23:03,998;00:23:06,080;of the forest made these.
289;00:23:06,080;00:23:07,914;When?
290;00:23:13,414;00:23:15,706;A very long time ago.
291;00:23:18,873;00:23:21,330;They were right here,
292;00:23:21,330;00:23:23,748;standing where
292;00:23:21,330;00:23:23,748;we're standing.
293;00:23:23,748;00:23:28,914;Before there were Targaryens
293;00:23:23,748;00:23:28,914;or Starks or Lannisters.
294;00:23:28,914;00:23:30,998;Maybe even before
294;00:23:28,914;00:23:30,998;there were men.
295;00:23:32,080;00:23:33,330;No.
296;00:23:43,873;00:23:48,581;They were here together,
296;00:23:43,873;00:23:48,581;the children and the First Men.
297;00:23:48,581;00:23:50,789;Doing what?
297;00:23:48,581;00:23:50,789;Fighting each other?
298;00:24:01,330;00:24:06,372;They fought together
298;00:24:01,330;00:24:06,372;against their common enemy.
299;00:24:06,372;00:24:10,247;Despite their differences,
299;00:24:06,372;00:24:10,247;despite their suspicions.
300;00:24:12,414;00:24:13,414;Together.
301;00:24:15,247;00:24:18,330;We need to do the same
301;00:24:15,247;00:24:18,330;if we're going to survive.
302;00:24:21,956;00:24:24,164;Because the enemy
302;00:24:21,956;00:24:24,164;is real.
303;00:24:25,789;00:24:27,414;It's always been real.
304;00:24:37,956;00:24:39,706;And you say
304;00:24:37,956;00:24:39,706;you can't defeat them
305;00:24:39,706;00:24:43,622;without my armies
305;00:24:39,706;00:24:43,622;and my dragons?
306;00:24:43,622;00:24:46,247;No, I don't think I can.
307;00:24:54,456;00:24:56,748;I will fight for you.
308;00:24:56,748;00:24:58,622;I will fight
308;00:24:56,748;00:24:58,622;for the North.
309;00:25:02,706;00:25:04,873;When you
309;00:25:02,706;00:25:04,873;bend the knee.
310;00:25:10,497;00:25:12,039;My people...
311;00:25:13,456;00:25:15,748;won't accept
311;00:25:13,456;00:25:15,748;a southern ruler.
312;00:25:15,748;00:25:18,289;Not after everything
312;00:25:15,748;00:25:18,289;they've suffered.
313;00:25:21,789;00:25:24,330;They will
313;00:25:21,789;00:25:24,330;if their king does.
314;00:25:25,998;00:25:28,998;They chose you
314;00:25:25,998;00:25:28,998;to lead them.
315;00:25:28,998;00:25:31,164;They chose you
315;00:25:28,998;00:25:31,164;to protect them.
316;00:25:32,789;00:25:35,998;Isn't their survival
316;00:25:32,789;00:25:35,998;more important than your pride?
317;00:25:56,372;00:25:58,456;What is it?
318;00:25:58,456;00:26:01,205;We took
318;00:25:58,456;00:26:01,205;Casterly Rock.
319;00:26:01,205;00:26:03,205;That's very good
319;00:26:01,205;00:26:03,205;to hear.
320;00:26:07,706;00:26:08,873;Isn't it?
321;00:26:16,914;00:26:19,205;You'll want to discuss this
321;00:26:16,914;00:26:19,205;amongst yourselves.
322;00:26:19,205;00:26:20,873;Perhaps--
322;00:26:19,205;00:26:20,873;You will stay.
323;00:26:21,956;00:26:23,956;All my allies are gone.
324;00:26:23,956;00:26:26,372;They've been taken from me
324;00:26:23,956;00:26:26,372;while I've been sitting here on this island.
325;00:26:26,372;00:26:28,914;You still have the largest armies.
325;00:26:26,372;00:26:28,914;Who won't be able to eat
326;00:26:28,914;00:26:30,998;because Cersei has taken
326;00:26:28,914;00:26:30,998;all the food from the Reach.
327;00:26:30,998;00:26:32,998;Call Grey Worm
327;00:26:30,998;00:26:32,998;and the Unsullied back.
328;00:26:32,998;00:26:35,789;We still have enough ships
328;00:26:32,998;00:26:35,789;to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.
329;00:26:35,789;00:26:38,039;Commit to the blockade
329;00:26:35,789;00:26:38,039;of King's Landing.
330;00:26:38,039;00:26:39,642;We have a plan.
330;00:26:38,039;00:26:39,642;It's still the right plan.
331;00:26:39,666;00:26:41,079;The right plan!
332;00:26:41,080;00:26:45,873;Your strategy has lost us
332;00:26:41,080;00:26:45,873;Dorne, the Iron Islands, and the Reach.
333;00:26:45,873;00:26:49,289;If I have underestimated our enemies--
333;00:26:45,873;00:26:49,289;Our enemies?
334;00:26:49,289;00:26:51,539;Your family, you mean.
335;00:26:51,539;00:26:54,414;Perhaps you don't want
335;00:26:51,539;00:26:54,414;to hurt them after all.
336;00:27:03,122;00:27:05,330;Enough with
336;00:27:03,122;00:27:05,330;the clever plans.
337;00:27:05,330;00:27:06,998;I have three
337;00:27:05,330;00:27:06,998;large dragons.
338;00:27:06,998;00:27:08,706;I'm going to fly them
338;00:27:06,998;00:27:08,706;to the Red Keep.
339;00:27:08,706;00:27:10,039;We've discussed this.
340;00:27:10,039;00:27:13,289;My enemies
340;00:27:10,039;00:27:13,289;are in the Red Keep.
341;00:27:13,289;00:27:16,664;What kind of a queen am I if I'm
341;00:27:13,289;00:27:16,664;not willing to risk my life to fight them?
342;00:27:16,664;00:27:18,414;A smart one.
343;00:27:21,789;00:27:23,789;What do you think
343;00:27:21,789;00:27:23,789;I should do?
344;00:27:26,122;00:27:28,372;I would never presume to--
344;00:27:26,122;00:27:28,372;I'm at war.
345;00:27:28,372;00:27:30,414;I'm losing.
346;00:27:32,080;00:27:33,956;What do you think
346;00:27:32,080;00:27:33,956;I should do?
347;00:27:40,539;00:27:42,998;I never thought that
347;00:27:40,539;00:27:42,998;dragons would exist again.
348;00:27:42,998;00:27:43,998;No one did.
349;00:27:46,289;00:27:48,122;The people
349;00:27:46,289;00:27:48,122;who follow you
350;00:27:48,122;00:27:51,289;know that you made
350;00:27:48,122;00:27:51,289;something impossible happen.
351;00:27:52,664;00:27:54,164;Maybe that
351;00:27:52,664;00:27:54,164;helps them believe
352;00:27:54,164;00:27:57,330;that you can make other
352;00:27:54,164;00:27:57,330;impossible things happen.
353;00:27:57,330;00:27:59,289;Build a world
353;00:27:57,330;00:27:59,289;that's different
354;00:27:59,289;00:28:01,706;from the shit one
354;00:27:59,289;00:28:01,706;they've always known.
355;00:28:03,956;00:28:08,330;But if you use them
355;00:28:03,956;00:28:08,330;to melt castles and burn cities,
356;00:28:08,330;00:28:09,956;you're not different.
357;00:28:11,664;00:28:13,664;You're just
357;00:28:11,664;00:28:13,664;more of the same.
358;00:28:28,497;00:28:30,164;Don't lunge.
359;00:28:43,039;00:28:44,998;Don't go where
359;00:28:43,039;00:28:44,998;your enemy leads you.
360;00:28:46,664;00:28:48,039;Up.
361;00:28:53,039;00:28:53,795;And don't--
362;00:28:53,819;00:28:55,742;Don't fight someone like her
362;00:28:53,819;00:28:55,742;in the first place.
363;00:29:01,706;00:29:03,205;Nice sword.
364;00:29:05,497;00:29:06,831;Very nice dagger.
365;00:29:14,205;00:29:17,164;If they haven't contributed
365;00:29:14,205;00:29:17,164;the right amount of grain to the stores,
366;00:29:17,164;00:29:19,581;then I'm afraid they'll have to make due
366;00:29:17,164;00:29:19,581;with what they've brought.
367;00:29:19,581;00:29:20,873;We can't...
368;00:29:25,205;00:29:26,748;It's been a while
368;00:29:25,205;00:29:26,748;since I trained.
369;00:29:26,748;00:29:29,372;I can go and find
369;00:29:26,748;00:29:29,372;the master of arms for you, my lady.
370;00:29:29,372;00:29:32,247;He didn't beat
370;00:29:29,372;00:29:32,247;the Hound.
371;00:29:32,247;00:29:34,289;You did.
372;00:29:34,289;00:29:35,789;I want to train
372;00:29:34,289;00:29:35,789;with you.
373;00:29:37,873;00:29:41,164;You swore to serve
373;00:29:37,873;00:29:41,164;both my mother's daughters,
374;00:29:41,164;00:29:42,289;didn't you?
375;00:29:49,956;00:29:51,581;Move aside, Podrick.
376;00:29:56,122;00:29:58,539;You can't use that, my lady.
376;00:29:56,122;00:29:58,539;It's too small.
377;00:29:58,539;00:30:00,748;I won't cut you.
377;00:29:58,539;00:30:00,748;Don't worry.
378;00:30:02,164;00:30:04,122;I'll try not to.
379;00:31:19,706;00:31:21,706;Who taught you
379;00:31:19,706;00:31:21,706;how to do that?
380;00:31:21,706;00:31:23,372;No one.
381;00:31:57,998;00:32:00,664;What do you think of her?
381;00:31:57,998;00:32:00,664;Who?
382;00:32:00,664;00:32:05,122;I believe you know
382;00:32:00,664;00:32:05,122;of whom I speak.
383;00:32:05,122;00:32:07,456;I think she has
383;00:32:05,122;00:32:07,456;a good heart.
384;00:32:07,456;00:32:09,247;A good heart?
385;00:32:09,247;00:32:11,914;I've noticed you staring
385;00:32:09,247;00:32:11,914;at her good heart.
386;00:32:11,914;00:32:14,748;There's no time
386;00:32:11,914;00:32:14,748;for that.
387;00:32:14,748;00:32:17,581;I saw the Night King, Davos.
387;00:32:14,748;00:32:17,581;I looked into his eyes.
388;00:32:19,080;00:32:21,497;How many men do we have
388;00:32:19,080;00:32:21,497;in the North to fight him?
389;00:32:21,497;00:32:23,039;10,000? Less?
390;00:32:23,039;00:32:25,164;Fewer.
390;00:32:23,039;00:32:25,164;What?
391;00:32:25,164;00:32:28,706;Speaking of good hearts--
391;00:32:25,164;00:32:28,706;Missandei of Naath.
392;00:32:29,831;00:32:32,706;Ser Davos, Lord Snow.
393;00:32:32,706;00:32:34,247;King Snow, isn't it?
394;00:32:34,247;00:32:35,622;No, that doesn't
394;00:32:34,247;00:32:35,622;sound right.
395;00:32:35,622;00:32:37,497;King Jon?
395;00:32:35,622;00:32:37,497;It doesn't matter.
396;00:32:37,497;00:32:40,330;Forgive me,
396;00:32:37,497;00:32:40,330;but may I ask a question?
397;00:32:40,330;00:32:42,289;Of course.
398;00:32:42,289;00:32:46,164;Your name is Jon Snow,
398;00:32:42,289;00:32:46,164;but your father's name was Ned Stark?
399;00:32:46,164;00:32:48,330;I'm a bastard.
400;00:32:50,205;00:32:52,289;My mother and father
400;00:32:50,205;00:32:52,289;weren't married.
401;00:32:52,289;00:32:54,247;Is the custom
401;00:32:52,289;00:32:54,247;different in Naath?
402;00:32:54,247;00:32:56,164;We don't have
402;00:32:54,247;00:32:56,164;marriage in Naath,
403;00:32:56,164;00:32:59,122;so the concept
403;00:32:56,164;00:32:59,122;of a bastard doesn't exist.
404;00:32:59,122;00:33:02,622;That sounds...
404;00:32:59,122;00:33:02,622;liberating.
405;00:33:04,622;00:33:06,831;Why did you leave
405;00:33:04,622;00:33:06,831;your homeland?
406;00:33:06,831;00:33:09,456;I was stolen away
406;00:33:06,831;00:33:09,456;by slavers.
407;00:33:09,456;00:33:10,956;I'm sorry.
408;00:33:10,956;00:33:14,080;If I may,
408;00:33:10,956;00:33:14,080;how did a slave girl
409;00:33:14,080;00:33:16,330;come to advise
409;00:33:14,080;00:33:16,330;Daenerys Targaryen?
410;00:33:16,330;00:33:20,205;She bought me from my master
410;00:33:16,330;00:33:20,205;and set me free.
411;00:33:20,205;00:33:21,998;That was good of her.
412;00:33:21,998;00:33:25,956;Of course, you're
412;00:33:21,998;00:33:25,956;serving her now, aren't you?
413;00:33:25,956;00:33:30,122;I serve my queen
413;00:33:25,956;00:33:30,122;because I want to serve my queen.
414;00:33:30,122;00:33:31,873;Because
414;00:33:30,122;00:33:31,873;I believe in her.
415;00:33:31,873;00:33:34,831;And if you wanted to sail
415;00:33:31,873;00:33:34,831;home to Naath tomorrow?
416;00:33:34,831;00:33:38,164;Then she would give me a ship
416;00:33:34,831;00:33:38,164;and wish me good fortune.
417;00:33:39,330;00:33:40,330;You believe that?
418;00:33:41,706;00:33:43,164;I know it.
419;00:33:43,164;00:33:46,164;All of us
419;00:33:43,164;00:33:46,164;who came with her from Essos,
420;00:33:46,164;00:33:47,873;we believe in her.
421;00:33:47,873;00:33:50,539;She's not our queen
421;00:33:47,873;00:33:50,539;because she's the daughter
422;00:33:50,539;00:33:53,664;of some king
422;00:33:50,539;00:33:53,664;we never knew.
423;00:33:53,664;00:33:56,456;She's the queen
423;00:33:53,664;00:33:56,456;we chose.
424;00:33:58,039;00:34:00,330;Will you forgive me
424;00:33:58,039;00:34:00,330;if I switch sides?
425;00:34:05,581;00:34:07,497;Is that a Greyjoy ship?
426;00:34:24,748;00:34:26,372;Halt!
427;00:34:50,914;00:34:52,581;Jon.
428;00:34:55,748;00:34:57,080;I didn't know
428;00:34:55,748;00:34:57,080;you were here.
429;00:35:04,247;00:35:06,414;S-Sansa...
430;00:35:08,080;00:35:10,414;is she all right?
431;00:35:11,456;00:35:13,581;What you did for her...
432;00:35:14,873;00:35:16,914;is the only reason
432;00:35:14,873;00:35:16,914;I'm not killing you.
433;00:35:25,372;00:35:27,956;We heard your uncle
433;00:35:25,372;00:35:27,956;attacked your fleet.
434;00:35:27,956;00:35:30,789;We thought
434;00:35:27,956;00:35:30,789;you were dead.
435;00:35:30,789;00:35:32,414;I should be.
436;00:35:32,414;00:35:33,789;Your sister?
437;00:35:35,414;00:35:37,914;Euron has her.
438;00:35:37,914;00:35:40,622;I came to ask the queen
438;00:35:37,914;00:35:40,622;to help me get her back.
439;00:35:43,456;00:35:44,914;The queen is gone.
440;00:35:46,789;00:35:49,247;Where did she go?
441;00:35:49,247;00:35:52,831;Get the horses watered!
442;00:36:08,664;00:36:11,497;All the gold's safely through
442;00:36:08,664;00:36:11,497;the gates of King's Landing.
443;00:36:11,497;00:36:12,664;Good.
444;00:36:12,664;00:36:13,998;We need to get
444;00:36:12,664;00:36:13,998;the last of these wagons
445;00:36:13,998;00:36:16,080;over the Blackwater Rush
445;00:36:13,998;00:36:16,080;before nightfall.
446;00:36:16,080;00:36:17,789;The head of the line
446;00:36:16,080;00:36:17,789;is ambushed,
447;00:36:17,789;00:36:20,080;the tail will never be able
447;00:36:17,789;00:36:20,080;to reinforce in time.
448;00:36:20,080;00:36:21,706;Well, we are stretched
448;00:36:20,080;00:36:21,706;a bit thin.
449;00:36:21,706;00:36:23,164;With your permission,
450;00:36:23,164;00:36:26,330;flogging stragglers
450;00:36:23,164;00:36:26,330;has a marked effect on mobility.
451;00:36:28,080;00:36:30,789;Let's give them
451;00:36:28,080;00:36:30,789;fair warning first.
452;00:36:30,789;00:36:32,706;These men fought well
452;00:36:30,789;00:36:32,706;at Highgarden.
453;00:36:43,664;00:36:46,080;Now, get it on this thing.
454;00:36:46,080;00:36:48,330;Lift!
455;00:36:51,581;00:36:53,330;Ser Jaime.
455;00:36:51,581;00:36:53,330;Rickon.
456;00:36:53,330;00:36:54,748;Dickon.
457;00:36:58,164;00:37:00,831;I hear you fought bravely
457;00:36:58,164;00:37:00,831;at Highgarden.
458;00:37:00,831;00:37:02,039;Your first battle?
459;00:37:03,873;00:37:06,247;And?
460;00:37:06,247;00:37:07,497;It was glorious.
461;00:37:07,497;00:37:10,039;Come on,
461;00:37:07,497;00:37:10,039;your father's not here.
462;00:37:11,539;00:37:14,456;All my life, we've been pledged
462;00:37:11,539;00:37:14,456;to House Tyrell.
463;00:37:14,456;00:37:17,706;I knew some of those men.
463;00:37:14,456;00:37:17,706;I hunted with them.
464;00:37:17,706;00:37:20,456;They didn't
464;00:37:17,706;00:37:20,456;deserve to die.
465;00:37:20,456;00:37:22,622;But Lady Olenna
465;00:37:20,456;00:37:22,622;chose to betray her queen
466;00:37:22,622;00:37:24,748;and support
466;00:37:22,622;00:37:24,748;the Targaryen girl.
467;00:37:24,748;00:37:27,706;So here we are.
468;00:37:27,706;00:37:29,873;I didn't expect it
468;00:37:27,706;00:37:29,873;to smell like that.
469;00:37:29,873;00:37:31,956;Men shit themselves
469;00:37:29,873;00:37:31,956;when they die.
470;00:37:31,956;00:37:34,039;Didn't they teach you that
470;00:37:31,956;00:37:34,039;at fancy lad school?
471;00:37:35,914;00:37:38,080;Well, I learned it
471;00:37:35,914;00:37:38,080;when I was five.
472;00:37:45,122;00:37:47,289;What?
473;00:37:47,289;00:37:49,247;Listen.
474;00:38:00,956;00:38:04,706;Spears and shields!
474;00:38:00,956;00:38:04,706;Spears and shields!
475;00:38:04,706;00:38:06,247;What is it?
475;00:38:04,706;00:38:06,247;Get in line!
476;00:38:06,247;00:38:09,247;Spears and shields!
476;00:38:06,247;00:38:09,247;Spears and shields!
477;00:38:10,706;00:38:13,748;Get in line now!
478;00:38:13,748;00:38:15,956;Form up!
478;00:38:13,748;00:38:15,956;Come on, lads!
479;00:38:15,956;00:38:17,539;Guard those wagons!
480;00:38:17,539;00:38:19,998;Form a line!
480;00:38:17,539;00:38:19,998;Form a line!
481;00:38:23,414;00:38:25,122;Round those spears!
482;00:38:31,956;00:38:34,122;Shield wall!
483;00:38:35,456;00:38:37,122;Fill the gaps!
484;00:38:37,122;00:38:40,456;Archers, steady!
484;00:38:37,122;00:38:40,456;Hold together!
485;00:38:40,456;00:38:42,497;Archers!
485;00:38:40,456;00:38:42,497;Look alive!
486;00:38:42,497;00:38:44,289;Get tight!
487;00:38:44,289;00:38:46,122;Get in line, boys!
488;00:38:46,122;00:38:48,539;Ready!
488;00:38:46,122;00:38:48,539;Here they come!
489;00:39:13,539;00:39:15,873;Courage, lads!
489;00:39:13,539;00:39:15,873;Courage!
490;00:39:15,873;00:39:18,789;Wait! Wait for it!
491;00:39:18,789;00:39:20,956;Spears out!
492;00:39:25,164;00:39:28,539;Spears out!
492;00:39:25,164;00:39:28,539;Steady! Hold the line!
493;00:39:38,247;00:39:40,831;Get back to King's Landing.
493;00:39:38,247;00:39:40,831;I'm not abandoning my army.
494;00:39:40,831;00:39:43,164;You're the commander,
494;00:39:40,831;00:39:43,164;not a damn infantryman.
495;00:39:43,164;00:39:45,205;Those fuckers are
495;00:39:43,164;00:39:45,205;about to swamp us.
496;00:39:46,372;00:39:48,372;We can hold them off.
497;00:40:06,372;00:40:07,873;Dracarys!
498;00:40:45,622;00:40:48,039;Hold the line!
499;00:40:48,039;00:40:49,414;Hold!
500;00:40:50,831;00:40:52,956;Hold it, lads!
500;00:40:50,831;00:40:52,956;Hold the line!
501;00:40:56,372;00:40:59,289;Throw it!
502;00:41:01,122;00:41:02,581;Hold!
503;00:41:25,247;00:41:27,456;Draw!
504;00:41:27,456;00:41:28,456;Loose!
505;00:42:03,330;00:42:05,581;Archers!
505;00:42:03,330;00:42:05,581;Archers!
506;00:42:05,581;00:42:07,330;Archers, with me!
507;00:42:07,330;00:42:10,289;Archers, to the line!
