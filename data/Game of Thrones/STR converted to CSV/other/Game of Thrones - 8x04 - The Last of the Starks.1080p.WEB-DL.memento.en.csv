1;00:00:04,789;00:00:06,205;Who would you say is the father?
2;00:00:06,623;00:00:07,706;You.
3;00:00:08,748;00:00:11,247;I'm going to put a prince
3;00:00:08,748;00:00:11,247;in your belly.
4;00:00:13,539;00:00:16,997;Our queen has a keen sense
4;00:00:13,539;00:00:16,997;of poetic justice.
5;00:00:17,080;00:00:18,497;What would she do for the man
6;00:00:18,581;00:00:20,706;who rids her
6;00:00:18,581;00:00:20,706;of her treasonous brothers?
7;00:00:21,581;00:00:24,080;My name...
7;00:00:21,581;00:00:24,080;my real name...
8;00:00:24,748;00:00:26,413;is Aegon Targaryen.
9;00:00:26,873;00:00:27,955;It's true, Dany.
10;00:00:28,456;00:00:29,623;If it were true...
11;00:00:30,247;00:00:31,706;you'd have a claim to the Iron Throne.
12;00:00:32,414;00:00:34,414;She doesn't like your queen, does she?
13;00:00:34,831;00:00:36,456;She's defending our family.
14;00:00:36,748;00:00:38,122;I'm her family, too.
15;00:00:39,664;00:00:40,873;Don't forget that.
16;00:05:22,955;00:05:26,205;We're here to say goodbye
16;00:05:22,955;00:05:26,205;to our brothers and sisters.
17;00:05:27,205;00:05:29,539;To our fathers and mothers.
18;00:05:31,372;00:05:32,497;To our friends.
19;00:05:34,122;00:05:35,955;Our fellow men and women
20;00:05:36,039;00:05:38,664;who set aside their differences...
21;00:05:40,080;00:05:41,581;to fight together...
22;00:05:43,247;00:05:45,748;and die together
23;00:05:45,831;00:05:47,789;so that others might live.
24;00:05:50,372;00:05:52,706;Everyone in this world
25;00:05:52,789;00:05:55,581;owes them a debt
25;00:05:52,789;00:05:55,581;that can never be repaid.
26;00:05:57,039;00:05:59,955;It is our duty and our honor
27;00:06:00,039;00:06:03,247;to keep them alive in memory...
28;00:06:04,414;00:06:06,122;for those who come after us...
29;00:06:07,331;00:06:09,247;and those who come after them...
30;00:06:11,122;00:06:14,122;for as long as men draw breath.
31;00:06:16,039;00:06:19,539;They were the shields
31;00:06:16,039;00:06:19,539;that guarded the realms of men.
32;00:06:20,914;00:06:23,748;And we shall never see
32;00:06:20,914;00:06:23,748;their like again.
33;00:08:55,247;00:08:56,873;To your health.
34;00:09:23,873;00:09:25,331;Have you seen Arya?
35;00:09:26,873;00:09:28,706;You can still smell the burning bodies,
36;00:09:28,789;00:09:30,289;and that's where your head is at.
37;00:09:30,372;00:09:33,372;I just want to thank her for--
37;00:09:30,372;00:09:33,372;I'm sure you do.
38;00:09:33,456;00:09:34,706;Look, it's not about that.
39;00:09:34,789;00:09:36,539;Of course it's about that, you twat.
40;00:09:36,623;00:09:37,706;Why shouldn't it be?
41;00:09:37,789;00:09:40,997;The dead are dead. You're not.
42;00:09:54,331;00:09:55,831;Gendry.
43;00:09:58,247;00:09:59,664;That's right, isn't it?
44;00:10:06,164;00:10:07,247;Yes, Your Grace.
45;00:10:07,331;00:10:09,539;You're Robert Baratheon's son.
46;00:10:15,914;00:10:17,873;You are aware
46;00:10:15,914;00:10:17,873;he took my family's throne
47;00:10:17,955;00:10:20,289;and tried to have me murdered?
48;00:10:20,372;00:10:23,914;I didn't even know he was my
48;00:10:20,372;00:10:23,914;father until after he was dead.
49;00:10:23,997;00:10:27,205;Yes, he's dead.
50;00:10:27,289;00:10:28,873;His brothers are too.
51;00:10:30,331;00:10:32,997;So who's Lord of Storm's End now?
52;00:10:34,748;00:10:35,997;I don't know, Your Grace.
53;00:10:36,080;00:10:37,914;Does anyone?
54;00:10:48,205;00:10:50,581;I think you should be
54;00:10:48,205;00:10:50,581;Lord of Storm's End.
55;00:10:56,289;00:10:57,539;I can't be. I'm a bastard.
56;00:10:57,623;00:11:02,122;No, you are Lord
56;00:10:57,623;00:11:02,122;Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End,
57;00:11:02,205;00:11:05,372;the lawful son of Robert Baratheon.
58;00:11:05,456;00:11:08,205;Because that is what I have made you.
59;00:11:17,247;00:11:21,164;To Lord Gendry Baratheon
59;00:11:17,247;00:11:21,164;of Storm's End.
60;00:11:21,247;00:11:23,456;To Gendry!
61;00:11:23,539;00:11:25,748;Lord Gendry!
62;00:11:25,831;00:11:27,748;Gendry!
63;00:11:27,831;00:11:30,247;Gendry!
63;00:11:27,831;00:11:30,247;Gendry!
64;00:11:32,164;00:11:33,914;Lord Gendry!
65;00:11:35,247;00:11:36,164;Gendry!
66;00:11:39,414;00:11:41,205;That's easy, isn't it?
67;00:11:43,539;00:11:46,664;A fitting reward for a hero.
67;00:11:43,539;00:11:46,664;Uh, hold on.
68;00:11:46,748;00:11:50,539;And a Lord of Storm's End
68;00:11:46,748;00:11:50,539;who will be forever loyal to you.
69;00:11:50,623;00:11:52,456;Come, my lord.
69;00:11:50,623;00:11:52,456;See?
70;00:11:52,539;00:11:54,914;You're not the only one who's clever.
71;00:12:04,623;00:12:07,581;I have to go down
71;00:12:04,623;00:12:07,581;and get another barrel.
72;00:12:10,914;00:12:13,789;We fought dead things
72;00:12:10,914;00:12:13,789;and lived to talk about it.
73;00:12:13,873;00:12:17,080;If this isn't the time to drink,
73;00:12:13,873;00:12:17,080;when is?
74;00:12:27,372;00:12:28,914;The last time I saw her,
75;00:12:28,997;00:12:32,289;I told her I'd kill her
75;00:12:28,997;00:12:32,289;if I ever saw her again.
76;00:12:32,372;00:12:35,122;I'm sure you had your reasons.
76;00:12:32,372;00:12:35,122;I did.
77;00:12:35,205;00:12:37,664;I do.
77;00:12:35,205;00:12:37,664;So did you?
78;00:12:39,831;00:12:41,748;Never got the chance.
79;00:12:41,831;00:12:43,331;She did it to herself.
80;00:12:45,581;00:12:47,497;Or her god did it to her.
81;00:12:50,039;00:12:51,706;Lord of Light.
82;00:12:51,789;00:12:56,080;We play his game for him,
82;00:12:51,789;00:12:56,080;we fight his war and win,
83;00:12:56,164;00:12:57,789;and then
84;00:12:57,873;00:12:59,164;he fucks off.
85;00:12:59,247;00:13:02,623;No signs, no blessings.
85;00:12:59,247;00:13:02,623;Who knows what he wants?
86;00:13:04,122;00:13:06,205;I don't imagine
86;00:13:04,122;00:13:06,205;thinking about that subject
87;00:13:06,289;00:13:08,080;will leave you any happier than before.
88;00:13:08,164;00:13:10,331;And what if I'm not trying to be happy?
89;00:13:12,664;00:13:13,789;Then you're in luck.
90;00:13:16,289;00:13:18,706;We may have defeated them,
91;00:13:18,789;00:13:21,706;but we still have us to contend with.
92;00:13:26,664;00:13:28,748;Thank you. I feel much better.
93;00:13:42,372;00:13:43,414;More ale!
94;00:13:45,997;00:13:47,331;This is clever.
95;00:13:48,748;00:13:51,205;Even better than the saddle
95;00:13:48,748;00:13:51,205;I designed for you.
96;00:13:52,539;00:13:54,831;It's the same as the one
96;00:13:52,539;00:13:54,831;Daeron Targaryen built
97;00:13:54,914;00:13:58,581;for his crippled nephew 120 years ago.
98;00:13:58,664;00:14:00,497;I liked that one.
99;00:14:00,581;00:14:03,748;You know our history
99;00:14:00,581;00:14:03,748;better than anyone.
100;00:14:03,831;00:14:06,955;That will be useful
100;00:14:03,831;00:14:06,955;as Lord of Winterfell.
101;00:14:07,039;00:14:08,997;I'm not Lord of Winterfell.
102;00:14:09,080;00:14:12,080;You're the only surviving
102;00:14:09,080;00:14:12,080;trueborn son of Ned Stark.
103;00:14:16,955;00:14:18,539;You don't want it.
104;00:14:18,623;00:14:21,039;I don't really want anymore.
105;00:14:23,080;00:14:24,414;I envy you.
106;00:14:27,414;00:14:29,247;You shouldn't envy me.
107;00:14:30,748;00:14:32,748;Mostly I live in the past.
108;00:14:38,122;00:14:39,539;All of it.
108;00:14:38,122;00:14:39,539;Go on.
109;00:14:39,623;00:14:42,205;No, not in one go.
109;00:14:39,623;00:14:42,205;Go on. I believe in you.
110;00:14:42,289;00:14:44,331;We have to celebrate our victory.
111;00:14:44,414;00:14:46,706;Vomiting is not celebrating.
112;00:14:46,789;00:14:48,581;Yes, it is.
113;00:14:48,664;00:14:49,955;Ah!
114;00:14:50,039;00:14:51,539;To the Dragon Queen!
115;00:14:53,955;00:14:57,080;To Arya Stark, the hero of Winterfell!
116;00:15:00,664;00:15:02,873;Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah!
116;00:15:00,664;00:15:02,873;Drink!
117;00:15:15,623;00:15:17,456;I'm fine!
118;00:15:30,831;00:15:31,831;Your turn.
119;00:15:31,914;00:15:33,497;Um...
120;00:15:34,372;00:15:37,497;You are an only child.
121;00:15:38,623;00:15:40,247;I told you I was.
121;00:15:38,623;00:15:40,247;You didn't.
122;00:15:40,331;00:15:43,164;I did.
122;00:15:40,331;00:15:43,164;I surmised it.
123;00:15:43,247;00:15:44,789;Drink.
124;00:15:45,789;00:15:47,039;Go again.
125;00:15:47,122;00:15:48,456;Why does he get to go again?
126;00:15:48,539;00:15:50,414;Because it's my game.
127;00:15:50,497;00:15:54,122;You have danced with Renly Baratheon.
128;00:15:56,164;00:15:56,997;No.
129;00:15:57,080;00:15:58,456;Drink.
130;00:15:59,581;00:16:01,372;The other way around!
131;00:16:01,456;00:16:03,664;I saw him riding that thing.
132;00:16:03,748;00:16:06,497;We all did.
132;00:16:03,748;00:16:06,497;No. No.
133;00:16:06,581;00:16:09,831;I saw him riding that thing.
134;00:16:09,914;00:16:11,914;That's right, you did.
134;00:16:09,914;00:16:11,914;I did.
135;00:16:11,997;00:16:15,748;That's why we all agreed to follow him.
136;00:16:15,831;00:16:18,039;That's the kind of man he is.
137;00:16:19,789;00:16:21,205;He's little...
138;00:16:22,205;00:16:23,789;...but he's strong.
139;00:16:23,873;00:16:26,748;Strong enough to befriend an enemy
140;00:16:26,831;00:16:28,080;and get murdered for it!
141;00:16:29,164;00:16:31,456;Most people get bloody murdered,
142;00:16:31,539;00:16:32,748;they stay that way.
143;00:16:32,831;00:16:34,456;Not this one.
144;00:16:36,039;00:16:38,247;Yeah, I didn't have much say in that.
145;00:16:38,331;00:16:41,372;Ah! He comes back
145;00:16:38,331;00:16:41,372;and keeps fighting.
146;00:16:41,456;00:16:44,955;Here, north of the Wall,
146;00:16:41,456;00:16:44,955;and then back here again.
147;00:16:45,039;00:16:48,497;He keeps fighting.
147;00:16:45,039;00:16:48,497;He keeps fighting.
148;00:16:48,581;00:16:51,497;He climbed on a fucking dragon
148;00:16:48,581;00:16:51,497;and fought.
149;00:16:51,581;00:16:54,164;What kind of person
149;00:16:51,581;00:16:54,164;climbs on a fucking dragon?
150;00:16:54,247;00:16:57,497;A madman or a king!
151;00:17:12,080;00:17:14,831;Drink.
151;00:17:12,080;00:17:14,831;Drink.
152;00:17:14,914;00:17:15,831;Drink.
153;00:17:46,581;00:17:47,664;Wrong!
154;00:17:47,748;00:17:49,831;Wrong, wrong, wrong! Drink!
155;00:17:51,955;00:17:53,122;Mm!
156;00:17:53,205;00:17:56,456;You were married. Before Sansa.
157;00:17:57,331;00:17:58,623;Drink.
158;00:18:03,748;00:18:05,873;You're drinking wine,
158;00:18:03,748;00:18:05,873;but you prefer ale!
159;00:18:05,955;00:18:06,873;No!
160;00:18:20,789;00:18:21,831;You're a virgin.
161;00:18:27,372;00:18:29,080;That's a statement about the present.
162;00:18:29,164;00:18:32,080;At no point in the past,
162;00:18:29,164;00:18:32,080;up until this very moment,
163;00:18:32,164;00:18:34,164;have you slept with a man.
164;00:18:35,789;00:18:36,831;Or a woman.
165;00:18:43,205;00:18:44,997;I have to piss.
166;00:18:45,080;00:18:49,080;We did it!
166;00:18:45,080;00:18:49,080;We faced those icy fucks.
167;00:18:49,164;00:18:51,748;Looked right into their blue eyes,
168;00:18:51,831;00:18:53,205;and here we are.
169;00:18:54,664;00:18:58,122;Now, which one of you cowards
169;00:18:54,664;00:18:58,122;shit in my pants?
170;00:19:01,789;00:19:03,955;Please pardon me for a moment.
171;00:19:23,581;00:19:24,997;Drink it!
172;00:19:46,414;00:19:48,581;And after all that,
173;00:19:48,664;00:19:52,205;this fucker comes north
173;00:19:48,664;00:19:52,205;and takes her from me.
174;00:19:52,289;00:19:54,205;Just takes her, like that.
175;00:19:56,205;00:19:57,831;I mean it, Clegane.
176;00:19:57,914;00:19:59,497;My heart is broken.
177;00:19:59,581;00:20:00,831;Don't touch me.
178;00:20:00,914;00:20:02,247;You can touch me.
179;00:20:03,539;00:20:05,581;I'm not afraid of wildlings.
180;00:20:05,664;00:20:07,414;Maybe you should be.
181;00:20:11,748;00:20:13,039;Well, Clegane...
182;00:20:14,164;00:20:16,664;it's time to drown our sorrows.
183;00:20:16,748;00:20:18,414;I'm not done with my drink.
184;00:20:19,539;00:20:21,414;You saved the day.
185;00:20:21,497;00:20:22,873;You owe me one.
186;00:20:22,955;00:20:26,456;Don't forget that.
186;00:20:22,955;00:20:26,456;For the rest of my days.
187;00:20:27,873;00:20:29,039;Are you ready now?
188;00:20:29,122;00:20:31,247;This is my drink.
189;00:20:36,789;00:20:38,497;All right!
190;00:20:46,247;00:20:49,289;She could have made you
190;00:20:46,247;00:20:49,289;happy, for a little while.
191;00:20:52,247;00:20:54,789;There's only one thing
191;00:20:52,247;00:20:54,789;that'll make me happy.
192;00:20:55,789;00:20:56,706;And what's that?
193;00:20:56,789;00:20:59,164;That's my fucking business.
194;00:21:03,873;00:21:06,706;Used to be you couldn't look at me.
195;00:21:06,789;00:21:09,039;That was a long time ago.
196;00:21:09,122;00:21:11,831;I've seen much worse than you
196;00:21:09,122;00:21:11,831;since then.
197;00:21:11,914;00:21:13,873;Yes, I've heard.
198;00:21:13,955;00:21:15,706;Heard you were broken in.
199;00:21:16,706;00:21:18,331;Heard you were broken in rough.
200;00:21:19,456;00:21:21,789;And he got what he deserved.
201;00:21:21,873;00:21:23,205;I gave it to him.
202;00:21:24,581;00:21:25,623;How?
203;00:21:26,914;00:21:28,039;Hounds.
204;00:21:31,873;00:21:33,539;You've changed, Little Bird.
205;00:21:39,997;00:21:41,372;None of it would have happened
206;00:21:41,456;00:21:43,289;if you'd left King's Landing with me.
207;00:21:43,372;00:21:46,372;No Littlefinger, no Ramsay...
208;00:21:47,997;00:21:49,247;none of it.
209;00:21:57,623;00:22:00,164;Without Littlefinger,
209;00:21:57,623;00:22:00,164;and Ramsay and the rest,
210;00:22:00,247;00:22:02,748;I would have stayed
210;00:22:00,247;00:22:02,748;a Little Bird all my life.
211;00:22:24,247;00:22:27,372;Hey!
211;00:22:24,247;00:22:27,372;Pour another one.
212;00:22:39,789;00:22:40,955;Don't shoot.
213;00:22:43,997;00:22:46,873;It's nighttime, it's freezing,
213;00:22:43,997;00:22:46,873;and everyone's celebrating.
214;00:22:46,955;00:22:49,456;You should be celebrating with them.
215;00:22:49,539;00:22:50,914;I am celebrating.
216;00:22:52,789;00:22:54,748;Yeah, I am too.
217;00:22:56,997;00:22:58,914;I'm not Gendry Rivers anymore.
218;00:22:58,997;00:23:02,372;I'm Gendry Baratheon,
218;00:22:58,997;00:23:02,372;Lord of Storm's End.
219;00:23:02,456;00:23:04,789;By order of the queen.
220;00:23:06,497;00:23:07,789;Congratulations.
221;00:23:11,080;00:23:13,039;I don't know how to be
221;00:23:11,080;00:23:13,039;lord of anything.
222;00:23:13,122;00:23:14,748;I hardly know how to use a fork.
223;00:23:14,831;00:23:16,748;All I know is that you're beautiful,
224;00:23:16,831;00:23:17,955;and I love you,
225;00:23:18,039;00:23:19,873;and none of it will be worth anything
226;00:23:19,955;00:23:21,122;if you're not with me.
227;00:23:22,456;00:23:23,456;So be with me.
228;00:23:27,955;00:23:31,581;Be my wife.
228;00:23:27,955;00:23:31,581;Be the Lady of Storm's End.
229;00:23:53,664;00:23:56,080;You'll be a wonderful lord,
230;00:23:56,164;00:23:59,205;and any lady
230;00:23:56,164;00:23:59,205;would be lucky to have you.
231;00:24:00,581;00:24:02,039;But I'm not a lady.
232;00:24:03,456;00:24:04,831;I never have been.
233;00:24:07,164;00:24:08,164;That's not me.
234;00:24:34,331;00:24:35,706;You didn't drink.
235;00:24:38,539;00:24:41,581;I didn't drink?
235;00:24:38,539;00:24:41,581;In the game.
236;00:24:41,664;00:24:44,831;I drank.
236;00:24:41,664;00:24:44,831;In the game. This is Dornish.
237;00:24:47,706;00:24:51,247;This is not the game.
237;00:24:47,706;00:24:51,247;This is only drinking.
238;00:24:52,289;00:24:53,414;Suit yourself.
239;00:25:04,372;00:25:06,748;You keep it warm enough in here.
240;00:25:10,122;00:25:13,122;It's the first thing I learnt
240;00:25:10,122;00:25:13,122;when I came to the North.
241;00:25:13,205;00:25:14,581;Keep your fire going.
242;00:25:14,664;00:25:16,997;Every time you leave the room,
242;00:25:14,664;00:25:16,997;put more wood on.
243;00:25:17,080;00:25:19,706;That's very diligent.
243;00:25:17,080;00:25:19,706;Very responsible.
244;00:25:19,789;00:25:21,664;Piss off.
244;00:25:19,789;00:25:21,664;You know the first thing
245;00:25:21,748;00:25:23,539;I learned in the North?
246;00:25:23,623;00:25:25,706;I hate the fucking North.
247;00:25:26,873;00:25:28,080;It grows on you.
248;00:25:29,789;00:25:32,414;I don't want things growing on me.
249;00:25:33,664;00:25:36,997;How about Tormund Giantsbane?
250;00:25:37,080;00:25:38,581;Has he grown on you?
251;00:25:40,247;00:25:42,247;He was very sad when you left.
252;00:25:43,748;00:25:45,581;You sound quite jealous.
253;00:25:48,414;00:25:49,914;I do, don't I?
254;00:25:54,955;00:25:56,789;It's bloody hot in here.
255;00:26:06,581;00:26:07,955;Oh, move aside.
256;00:26:13,623;00:26:14,664;What are you doing?
257;00:26:15,664;00:26:17,122;I'm taking your shirt off.
258;00:27:03,997;00:27:06,331;I've never slept with a knight before.
259;00:27:07,581;00:27:10,289;I've never slept with anyone before.
260;00:27:12,205;00:27:14,914;Then you have to drink.
260;00:27:12,205;00:27:14,914;Those are the rules.
261;00:27:15,997;00:27:17,372;I told you--
262;00:27:32,873;00:27:34,372;Are you drunk?
263;00:27:39,039;00:27:39,997;No.
264;00:27:45,039;00:27:46,331;Only a little.
265;00:27:56,497;00:27:58,205;I didn't know Ser Jorah well...
266;00:27:59,623;00:28:00,873;but I know this.
267;00:28:02,581;00:28:04,497;If he could have chosen a way to die,
268;00:28:04,581;00:28:06,581;it would have been protecting you.
269;00:28:07,623;00:28:08,623;He loved me.
270;00:28:11,581;00:28:13,706;And I couldn't love him back.
271;00:28:15,789;00:28:17,539;Not the way he wanted.
272;00:28:20,997;00:28:22,623;Not the way I love you.
273;00:28:25,748;00:28:27,205;Is that all right?
274;00:29:06,497;00:29:08,581;I wish you'd never told me.
275;00:29:09,831;00:29:12,623;If I didn't know,
275;00:29:09,831;00:29:12,623;I'd be happy right now.
276;00:29:14,080;00:29:15,289;I try to forget.
277;00:29:16,955;00:29:18,331;Tonight I did for a while,
278;00:29:18,414;00:29:21,205;and then I saw them
278;00:29:18,414;00:29:21,205;gathered around you.
279;00:29:22,497;00:29:25,039;I saw the way they looked at you.
280;00:29:26,122;00:29:27,497;I know that look.
281;00:29:29,164;00:29:32,664;So many people have looked at me
281;00:29:29,164;00:29:32,664;that way, but never here.
282;00:29:32,748;00:29:34,331;Never on this side of the sea.
283;00:29:35,789;00:29:37,080;I told you I don't want it.
284;00:29:37,164;00:29:39,706;It doesn't matter what you want.
285;00:29:39,789;00:29:41,581;You didn't want to be
285;00:29:39,789;00:29:41,581;King in the North.
286;00:29:41,664;00:29:44,247;What happens when they demand
286;00:29:41,664;00:29:44,247;you press your claim,
287;00:29:44,331;00:29:45,831;and take what is mine?
288;00:29:49,289;00:29:51,122;I'll refuse.
289;00:29:51,205;00:29:53,748;You are my queen. I don't know
289;00:29:51,205;00:29:53,748;what else I can say.
290;00:29:53,831;00:29:56,039;You can say nothing.
291;00:29:56,122;00:29:57,581;To anyone, ever.
292;00:29:57,664;00:29:59,664;Never tell them who you really are.
293;00:29:59,748;00:30:02,164;Swear your brother
293;00:29:59,748;00:30:02,164;and Samwell Tarly to secrecy,
294;00:30:02,247;00:30:03,456;and tell no one else.
295;00:30:03,539;00:30:05,164;Or it will take on a life of its own
296;00:30:05,247;00:30:06,955;and you won't be able to control it
297;00:30:07,039;00:30:08,247;or what it does to people.
298;00:30:08,331;00:30:10,831;No matter how many times
298;00:30:08,331;00:30:10,831;you bend the knee,
299;00:30:10,914;00:30:12,873;no matter what you swear.
300;00:30:18,039;00:30:21,497;I want it to be the way it was
300;00:30:18,039;00:30:21,497;between us.
301;00:30:30,706;00:30:32,497;I have to tell Sansa and Arya.
302;00:30:32,581;00:30:38,955;Sansa will want to see me gone
302;00:30:32,581;00:30:38,955;and you on the Iron Throne.
303;00:30:39,039;00:30:40,706;She won't.
304;00:30:40,789;00:30:43,831;She's not the girl you grew up with.
305;00:30:43,914;00:30:46,205;Not after what she's seen,
306;00:30:46,289;00:30:48,914;not after what they've done to her.
307;00:30:52,289;00:30:54,164;I owe them the truth.
308;00:30:54,247;00:30:57,122;Even if the truth destroys us?
309;00:30:57,205;00:30:58,914;It won't.
309;00:30:57,205;00:30:58,914;It will.
310;00:31:01,456;00:31:03,247;I've never begged for anything...
311;00:31:04,497;00:31:06,664;but I'm begging you.
312;00:31:06,748;00:31:09,748;Don't do this. Please.
313;00:31:16,372;00:31:17,748;You are my queen.
314;00:31:19,331;00:31:21,205;Nothing will change that.
315;00:31:24,122;00:31:25,831;And they are my family.
316;00:31:27,789;00:31:29,456;We can live together.
317;00:31:35,372;00:31:36,331;We can.
318;00:31:38,539;00:31:40,289;I've just told you how.
319;00:32:16,414;00:32:18,289;Half are gone.
320;00:32:22,122;00:32:23,623;The Northmen as well.
321;00:32:29,997;00:32:33,164;And the Golden Company
321;00:32:29,997;00:32:33,164;has arrived in King's Landing,
322;00:32:33,247;00:32:35,247;courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet.
323;00:32:35,331;00:32:39,039;The balance has grown
323;00:32:35,331;00:32:39,039;distressingly even.
324;00:32:39,122;00:32:41,914;When the people find out
324;00:32:39,122;00:32:41,914;what we have done for them,
325;00:32:41,997;00:32:43,247;that we saved them--
326;00:32:43,331;00:32:45,664;Cersei will make sure
326;00:32:43,331;00:32:45,664;they don't believe it.
327;00:32:47,664;00:32:49,289;We will hit her hard.
328;00:32:49,372;00:32:51,581;We will rip her out root and stem.
329;00:32:53,039;00:32:55,664;The objective here is to remove Cersei
330;00:32:55,748;00:32:58,414;without destroying King's Landing.
331;00:33:01,539;00:33:05,372;Thankfully,
331;00:33:01,539;00:33:05,372;she's losing allies by the day.
332;00:33:05,456;00:33:08,289;Yara Greyjoy has retaken
332;00:33:05,456;00:33:08,289;the Iron Islands
333;00:33:08,372;00:33:09,664;in her queen's name.
334;00:33:09,748;00:33:12,414;The new Prince of Dorne
334;00:33:09,748;00:33:12,414;pledges his support.
335;00:33:12,497;00:33:14,539;No matter how many lords
335;00:33:12,497;00:33:14,539;turn against her,
336;00:33:14,623;00:33:16,414;as long as she sits on the Iron Throne,
337;00:33:16,497;00:33:19,205;she can call herself
337;00:33:16,497;00:33:19,205;Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
338;00:33:21,539;00:33:23,289;We need the capital.
339;00:33:23,372;00:33:25,122;I watched the people of King's Landing
340;00:33:25,205;00:33:27,497;rebel against their king
340;00:33:25,205;00:33:27,497;when they were hungry,
341;00:33:27,581;00:33:29,789;and that was before winter began.
342;00:33:29,873;00:33:33,414;Give them the opportunity
342;00:33:29,873;00:33:33,414;and they will cast Cersei aside.
343;00:33:35,122;00:33:37,497;We'll surround the city.
344;00:33:37,581;00:33:39,831;If the Iron Fleet
344;00:33:37,581;00:33:39,831;tries to ferry in more food,
345;00:33:39,914;00:33:41,997;the dragons will destroy them.
346;00:33:42,080;00:33:44,497;If the Lannisters
346;00:33:42,080;00:33:44,497;and the Golden Company attack,
347;00:33:44,581;00:33:46,247;we'll defeat them in the field.
348;00:33:46,331;00:33:49,997;Once the people see
348;00:33:46,331;00:33:49,997;that Cersei is our only enemy,
349;00:33:50,080;00:33:52,080;her reign is over.
350;00:33:57,247;00:33:58,706;All right.
351;00:33:58,789;00:34:01,914;The men we have left are exhausted.
352;00:34:01,997;00:34:03,205;Many of them are wounded.
353;00:34:03,289;00:34:05,164;They'll fight better if they have time
354;00:34:05,247;00:34:06,623;to rest and recuperate.
355;00:34:07,914;00:34:09,122;How long do you suggest?
356;00:34:10,289;00:34:11,789;I can't say for certain,
357;00:34:11,873;00:34:13,914;not without talking to the officers.
358;00:34:17,289;00:34:20,164;I came north to fight alongside you
359;00:34:20,247;00:34:22,789;at great cost to my armies and myself.
360;00:34:24,039;00:34:26,873;Now that the time has come
360;00:34:24,039;00:34:26,873;to reciprocate,
361;00:34:26,955;00:34:28,748;you want to postpone.
362;00:34:28,831;00:34:31,706;It's not just our people.
362;00:34:28,831;00:34:31,706;It's yours.
363;00:34:31,789;00:34:33,414;You want to throw them into a war
364;00:34:33,497;00:34:35,039;they're not ready to fight?
365;00:34:35,122;00:34:36,831;The longer I leave my enemies alone,
366;00:34:36,914;00:34:38,414;the stronger they become.
367;00:34:41,955;00:34:45,497;The Northern forces
367;00:34:41,955;00:34:45,497;will honor their promises
368;00:34:45,581;00:34:46,873;and their allegiance
369;00:34:46,955;00:34:49,456;to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
370;00:34:54,831;00:34:56,664;What you command, we will obey.
371;00:35:01,414;00:35:02,997;So...
372;00:35:03,080;00:35:05,997;if all are in agreement...
373;00:35:06,080;00:35:08,914;Jon and Ser Davos
373;00:35:06,080;00:35:08,914;will ride down the Kingsroad
374;00:35:08,997;00:35:10,372;with the Northern troops
375;00:35:10,456;00:35:12,997;and the bulk of the remaining
375;00:35:10,456;00:35:12,997;Dothraki and Unsullied.
376;00:35:13,080;00:35:15,414;A smaller group of us
376;00:35:13,080;00:35:15,414;will ride to White Harbor,
377;00:35:15,497;00:35:17,414;and sail from there to Dragonstone
378;00:35:17,497;00:35:21,205;with our queen and her dragons
378;00:35:17,497;00:35:21,205;accompanying us from above.
379;00:35:21,289;00:35:23,955;Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here,
380;00:35:24,039;00:35:26,331;as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell.
381;00:35:29,372;00:35:31,289;We have won the Great War.
382;00:35:32,289;00:35:34,039;Now we will win the Last War.
383;00:35:35,331;00:35:37,331;In all Seven Kingdoms,
384;00:35:37,414;00:35:40,205;men will live without fear and cruelty
385;00:35:41,289;00:35:42,706;under their rightful queen.
386;00:35:56,164;00:35:57,331;We need a word.
387;00:36:01,456;00:36:04,414;You understand we'd all be dead
387;00:36:01,456;00:36:04,414;if not for her.
388;00:36:04,497;00:36:06,789;We'd be corpses
388;00:36:04,497;00:36:06,789;marching down to King's Landing.
389;00:36:06,873;00:36:08,289;Arya's the one
389;00:36:06,873;00:36:08,289;that killed the Night King.
390;00:36:08,372;00:36:10,456;Her men gave their lives
390;00:36:08,372;00:36:10,456;defending Winterfell--
391;00:36:10,539;00:36:12,122;And we will never forget them.
392;00:36:12,205;00:36:14,080;That doesn't mean that I want
392;00:36:12,205;00:36:14,080;to kneel to someone who--
393;00:36:14,164;00:36:16,831;I swore myself and the North
393;00:36:14,164;00:36:16,831;to her cause.
394;00:36:16,914;00:36:18,456;I respect that.
395;00:36:21,080;00:36:22,748;You respect it?
396;00:36:23,456;00:36:25,205;We needed her.
397;00:36:26,581;00:36:29,205;We needed her army, her dragons.
398;00:36:30,997;00:36:32,789;You did the right thing.
399;00:36:32,873;00:36:35,289;And we're doing the right thing
399;00:36:32,873;00:36:35,289;telling you
400;00:36:35,372;00:36:36,914;we don't trust your queen.
401;00:36:38,831;00:36:41,122;You don't know her yet.
401;00:36:38,831;00:36:41,122;I'll never know her.
402;00:36:41,205;00:36:42,497;She's not one of us.
403;00:36:42,581;00:36:44,497;If you only trust the people
403;00:36:42,581;00:36:44,497;you grew up with,
404;00:36:44,581;00:36:45,914;you won't make many allies.
405;00:36:45,997;00:36:47,539;That's all right.
406;00:36:47,623;00:36:49,748;I don't need many allies.
407;00:36:49,831;00:36:52,080;Arya...
407;00:36:49,831;00:36:52,080;We're family.
408;00:36:53,414;00:36:54,623;The four of us.
409;00:36:55,706;00:36:57,414;The last of the Starks.
410;00:37:01,456;00:37:02,914;I've never been a Stark.
411;00:37:04,080;00:37:05,664;You are.
412;00:37:05,748;00:37:08,748;You're just as much
412;00:37:05,748;00:37:08,748;Ned Stark's child as any of us.
413;00:37:08,831;00:37:10,706;You're my brother.
414;00:37:10,789;00:37:13,289;Not my half-brother
414;00:37:10,789;00:37:13,289;or my bastard brother.
415;00:37:14,122;00:37:15,664;My brother.
416;00:37:23,205;00:37:24,955;It's your choice.
417;00:37:32,122;00:37:34,331;I need to tell you something.
418;00:37:35,831;00:37:39,331;But you have to swear
418;00:37:35,831;00:37:39,331;you'll never tell another soul.
419;00:37:42,623;00:37:43,955;What is it?
420;00:37:45,247;00:37:48,289;You have to swear it,
420;00:37:45,247;00:37:48,289;before I tell you.
421;00:37:48,372;00:37:49,955;How can I promise to keep a secret
422;00:37:50,039;00:37:51,581;if I don't even know what it is?
423;00:37:51,664;00:37:53,331;Because we're family.
424;00:37:58,414;00:37:59,372;Swear it.
425;00:38:00,706;00:38:02,122;I swear it.
426;00:38:06,789;00:38:07,789;I swear it.
427;00:38:15,831;00:38:17,122;Tell them.
428;00:38:27,664;00:38:30,205;So she's going to stay here with you?
429;00:38:32,664;00:38:35,873;She's sworn to protect
429;00:38:32,664;00:38:35,873;the Stark girls, so...
430;00:38:39,205;00:38:40,664;Say something snide.
431;00:38:41,873;00:38:42,873;I'm happy.
432;00:38:42,955;00:38:44,706;I'm happy that you're happy.
433;00:38:47,623;00:38:50,997;I'm happy that you'll finally
433;00:38:47,623;00:38:50,997;have to climb for it.
434;00:38:53,039;00:38:56,331;Do you know how long I've waited
434;00:38:53,039;00:38:56,331;to tell tall-person jokes?
435;00:38:57,539;00:38:59,831;To climbing mountains.
436;00:38:59,914;00:39:01,372;To climbing mountains.
437;00:39:03,955;00:39:06,955;What's she like down there?
437;00:39:03,955;00:39:06,955;What?
438;00:39:07,039;00:39:08,997;That's not your concern.
439;00:39:09,080;00:39:11,623;I haven't been with a woman for years.
440;00:39:11,706;00:39:13,205;Give me a morsel.
440;00:39:11,706;00:39:13,205;You're a dog.
441;00:39:13,289;00:39:15,164;I am the Imp, and I demand to know.
442;00:39:15,247;00:39:17,039;I knew you were fucking her.
443;00:39:18,955;00:39:20,873;A pair of tall, blond toffs.
444;00:39:20,955;00:39:22,623;Must be like looking in the mirror.
445;00:39:22,706;00:39:24,539;Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
446;00:39:26,164;00:39:27,914;Where's your drink?
447;00:39:27,997;00:39:30,122;What are you--
447;00:39:27,997;00:39:30,122;What are you doing up North?
448;00:39:30,205;00:39:31,664;What are you doing with that?
449;00:39:31,748;00:39:33,289;Oh, this?
450;00:39:33,372;00:39:34,414;This is for you.
451;00:39:35,914;00:39:36,997;For both of you.
452;00:39:37,080;00:39:39,164;You're supposed to be south.
453;00:39:39,247;00:39:41,164;You boys are a pair
453;00:39:39,247;00:39:41,164;of gold-plated cunts.
454;00:39:41,247;00:39:42,748;Do you know that?
454;00:39:41,247;00:39:42,748;That's a bit rude.
455;00:39:42,831;00:39:45,039;Year after year,
455;00:39:42,831;00:39:45,039;I've shoveled Lannister shit,
456;00:39:45,122;00:39:48,039;and what do I have to show?
456;00:39:45,122;00:39:48,039;You're a knight, thanks to me.
457;00:39:48,122;00:39:49,706;Thanks to me.
457;00:39:48,122;00:39:49,706;And that title's worth as much
458;00:39:49,789;00:39:51,997;as a blond hair
458;00:39:49,789;00:39:51,997;from your brother's ballsack.
459;00:39:52,080;00:39:53,664;Power resides where men believe--
460;00:39:53,748;00:39:55,706;Shut your mouth.
461;00:39:55,789;00:39:58,122;I'm just trying--
461;00:39:55,789;00:39:58,122;I've never hit a dwarf before,
462;00:39:58,205;00:40:00,080;but say another word
462;00:39:58,205;00:40:00,080;and I will belt you.
463;00:40:00,164;00:40:02,706;See, I don't believe
463;00:40:00,164;00:40:02,706;you'd do that, after all--
464;00:40:02,789;00:40:04,539;You couldn't do it on your best day,
465;00:40:04,623;00:40:05,706;you one-handed fuck.
466;00:40:05,789;00:40:07,372;And your best days are long gone.
467;00:40:07,456;00:40:08,955;You broke my nose!
468;00:40:09,039;00:40:10,748;I did not break your nose.
468;00:40:09,039;00:40:10,748;How do you know?
469;00:40:10,831;00:40:13,122;Because I've been breaking noses
469;00:40:10,831;00:40:13,122;since I was your size,
470;00:40:13,205;00:40:16,122;and I know what it sounds like.
470;00:40:13,205;00:40:16,122;Now listen.
471;00:40:16,205;00:40:18,789;Your sister offered me Riverrun.
472;00:40:18,873;00:40:20,372;Nice big castle, good lands,
473;00:40:20,456;00:40:22,497;plenty of peasants
473;00:40:20,456;00:40:22,497;who do what they're told.
474;00:40:22,581;00:40:25,247;And you trust Cersei--
474;00:40:22,581;00:40:25,247;I knew your sister was dead
475;00:40:25,331;00:40:27,122;the second I saw those dragons.
476;00:40:27,205;00:40:28,789;Now, your army may be torn to shit,
477;00:40:28,873;00:40:31,080;but I'd still bet
477;00:40:28,873;00:40:31,080;on your Dragon Queen to win.
478;00:40:31,164;00:40:33,664;And it just so happens
478;00:40:31,164;00:40:33,664;I'm a betting man.
479;00:40:34,914;00:40:37,831;If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.
480;00:40:40,164;00:40:42,331;Mmm, that's good.
480;00:40:40,164;00:40:42,331;Of course, the odds change
481;00:40:42,414;00:40:44,414;if the Dragon Queen's Hand
481;00:40:42,414;00:40:44,414;turns up dead.
482;00:40:44,497;00:40:47,372;Maybe a few of her top generals
482;00:40:44,497;00:40:47,372;get picked off one by one.
483;00:40:47,456;00:40:49,372;All of a sudden...
483;00:40:47,456;00:40:49,372;May I speak?
484;00:40:49,456;00:40:52,122;Why not?
484;00:40:49,456;00:40:52,122;Only death will shut you up.
485;00:40:55,497;00:40:58,331;We made a deal long ago.
485;00:40:55,497;00:40:58,331;Do you remember?
486;00:40:58,414;00:40:59,581;If anyone offered me money
487;00:40:59,664;00:41:01,914;to kill you, you'd pay me double.
488;00:41:01,997;00:41:03,456;What's double Riverrun?
489;00:41:04,497;00:41:05,497;Highgarden.
490;00:41:07,664;00:41:09,164;You could be Lord of the Reach.
491;00:41:09,247;00:41:12,080;Highgarden? Are you mad?
491;00:41:09,247;00:41:12,080;It's better than being dead.
492;00:41:12,164;00:41:13,372;He's not going to kill us.
493;00:41:13,456;00:41:15,205;He wouldn't be talking to us if--
494;00:41:18,205;00:41:19,456;The way I see it,
495;00:41:19,539;00:41:22,205;I only need one
495;00:41:19,539;00:41:22,205;of the Lannister brothers alive.
496;00:41:22,289;00:41:24,414;Highgarden will never belong
496;00:41:22,289;00:41:24,414;to a cutthroat.
497;00:41:24,497;00:41:26,623;No? Who were your ancestors,
498;00:41:26,706;00:41:28,873;the ones who made your family rich?
499;00:41:28,955;00:41:30,539;Fancy lads in silk?
500;00:41:30,623;00:41:32,289;They were fucking cutthroats.
501;00:41:32,372;00:41:34,789;That's how all the great houses
501;00:41:32,372;00:41:34,789;started, isn't it?
502;00:41:34,873;00:41:37,289;With a hard bastard
502;00:41:34,873;00:41:37,289;who was good at killing people.
503;00:41:37,372;00:41:39,706;Kill a few hundred people,
503;00:41:37,372;00:41:39,706;they make you a lord.
504;00:41:39,789;00:41:41,789;Kill a few thousand,
504;00:41:39,789;00:41:41,789;they make you king.
505;00:41:41,873;00:41:46,289;And then all your cocksucking
505;00:41:41,873;00:41:46,289;grandsons can ruin the family
506;00:41:46,372;00:41:47,914;with their cocksucking ways.
507;00:41:51,748;00:41:52,748;Highgarden.
508;00:41:54,539;00:41:56,080;Give me your word.
509;00:41:57,831;00:41:59,289;You have my word.
510;00:42:01,164;00:42:04,539;None of this means a thing
510;00:42:01,164;00:42:04,539;until we take King's Landing.
511;00:42:05,664;00:42:08,080;We ride south in the morning.
512;00:42:08,164;00:42:09,331;We could use an officer
513;00:42:09,414;00:42:11,664;with knowledge of the city's defenses.
514;00:42:11,748;00:42:12,997;Oh, no.
515;00:42:13,080;00:42:15,664;No, my fighting days are done.
516;00:42:15,748;00:42:18,789;But I still got a few
516;00:42:15,748;00:42:18,789;killing days left, you hear me?
517;00:42:18,873;00:42:21,497;I'll come find you
517;00:42:18,873;00:42:21,497;when the war is done.
518;00:42:21,581;00:42:23,873;Till then, don't die.
519;00:42:48,664;00:42:50,789;For fuck's sake.
520;00:42:52,331;00:42:53,414;On your own?
521;00:42:54,623;00:42:56,122;Not anymore.
522;00:42:57,623;00:42:59,247;I don't like crowds.
523;00:43:00,914;00:43:01,955;Me neither.
524;00:43:03,164;00:43:05,331;Why not? They all love you now.
525;00:43:05,414;00:43:06,997;You're the big hero.
526;00:43:08,164;00:43:09,748;Don't like heroes.
527;00:43:11,706;00:43:15,164;It must have felt good sticking
527;00:43:11,706;00:43:15,164;a knife in that horned fucker.
528;00:43:16,456;00:43:18,164;Felt better than dying.
529;00:43:21,623;00:43:23,331;You're heading to King's Landing?
530;00:43:24,623;00:43:27,039;I have some unfinished business.
531;00:43:28,372;00:43:29,789;Me too.
532;00:43:35,873;00:43:37,997;I don't plan on coming back.
533;00:43:40,372;00:43:41,997;Neither do I.
534;00:43:43,623;00:43:45,997;Gonna leave me to die again
534;00:43:43,623;00:43:45,997;if I get hurt?
535;00:43:48,331;00:43:49,247;Probably.
536;00:44:33,539;00:44:34,497;My lady.
537;00:44:38,789;00:44:41,539;My lord is the standard response.
538;00:44:43,955;00:44:45,372;Why her?
539;00:44:49,414;00:44:51,414;You know she loves your brother.
540;00:44:51,497;00:44:53,623;That doesn't mean
540;00:44:51,497;00:44:53,623;she'll be a good queen.
541;00:44:54,831;00:44:57,539;You seem determined to dislike her.
542;00:44:58,997;00:45:00,164;A good relationship
543;00:45:00,247;00:45:01,581;between the Iron Throne and the North
544;00:45:01,664;00:45:03,414;has been the core of every peaceful,
545;00:45:03,497;00:45:05,080;prosperous reign we've ever known.
546;00:45:05,164;00:45:06,664;Jon will be Warden of the North,
547;00:45:06,748;00:45:08,748;so a good relationship seems likely.
548;00:45:10,456;00:45:13,664;I don't expect him to spend
548;00:45:10,456;00:45:13,664;much time here going forward.
549;00:45:13,748;00:45:15,748;Well, I suppose that's up to him.
550;00:45:20,080;00:45:21,456;Sansa, look at me.
551;00:45:27,205;00:45:29,372;With Jon in the capital,
552;00:45:29,456;00:45:32,122;you'll be the true power in the North.
553;00:45:32,205;00:45:33,997;I'd feel much better about the future
554;00:45:34,080;00:45:35,414;if I left here today believing
555;00:45:35,497;00:45:37,080;that you and Daenerys were allies.
556;00:45:37,164;00:45:40,914;What are you worried about?
556;00:45:37,164;00:45:40,914;Jon's taking our army with him.
557;00:45:40,997;00:45:42,664;Your queen still has her dragons--
558;00:45:42,748;00:45:43,914;She's your queen too.
559;00:45:50,955;00:45:53,205;You don't have to be her friend.
560;00:45:53,289;00:45:55,205;But why provoke her?
561;00:45:55,289;00:45:57,539;How is that in the best interest
561;00:45:55,289;00:45:57,539;of your family,
562;00:45:57,623;00:46:00,039;or the North, or--?
562;00:45:57,623;00:46:00,039;You're afraid of her.
563;00:46:02,497;00:46:06,831;Every good ruler
563;00:46:02,497;00:46:06,831;needs to inspire a bit of fear.
564;00:46:09,414;00:46:11,706;I don't want Jon to go down there.
565;00:46:11,789;00:46:15,456;The men in my family
565;00:46:11,789;00:46:15,456;don't do well in the capital.
566;00:46:15,539;00:46:18,247;No, but as your brother once told me,
567;00:46:18,331;00:46:19,706;he's not a Stark.
568;00:46:25,289;00:46:26,664;Are you all right?
569;00:46:33,164;00:46:35,748;Her people love her, you've seen that.
570;00:46:35,831;00:46:38,164;You've seen how they fight for her.
571;00:46:38,247;00:46:41,414;She wants to make the world
571;00:46:38,247;00:46:41,414;a better place.
572;00:46:43,748;00:46:45,831;I believe in her.
573;00:47:00,706;00:47:02,039;Tyrion.
574;00:47:04,873;00:47:07,456;What if there's someone else?
575;00:47:07,539;00:47:09,164;Someone better?
576;00:47:17,497;00:47:19,539;You're not gonna ride the dragon south?
577;00:47:23,247;00:47:24,414;Just a horse.
578;00:47:25,748;00:47:26,914;Rhaegal needs to heal.
579;00:47:26,997;00:47:28,706;He doesn't need me weighing him down.
580;00:47:28,789;00:47:32,122;You weigh as much as two fleas fucking.
581;00:47:33,414;00:47:35,080;I'm taking the Free Folk home.
582;00:47:36,080;00:47:38,831;We've had enough of the south.
583;00:47:38,914;00:47:40,955;The women down here don't like me.
584;00:47:43,039;00:47:45,205;This is the North, you know.
585;00:47:46,456;00:47:48,873;And the Free Folk are welcome to stay.
586;00:47:50,414;00:47:52,080;It isn't home.
587;00:47:52,164;00:47:53,623;We need room to wander.
588;00:47:53,706;00:47:55,789;I'll take them
588;00:47:53,706;00:47:55,789;back through Castle Black
589;00:47:55,873;00:47:58,331;as soon as the winter storms pass.
590;00:47:58,414;00:48:00,080;Back where we belong.
591;00:48:04,039;00:48:06,372;It's where he belongs too.
592;00:48:06,456;00:48:09,164;A direwolf has no place in the south.
593;00:48:10,414;00:48:12,789;Will you take him with you?
594;00:48:14,039;00:48:15,997;He'll be happier up there.
595;00:48:17,039;00:48:18,331;So would you.
596;00:48:20,331;00:48:22,748;I wish I was going with you.
597;00:48:27,122;00:48:28,414;This is farewell, then.
598;00:48:29,997;00:48:31,664;You never know.
599;00:48:37,873;00:48:40,122;You've got the North in you.
600;00:48:41,623;00:48:43,080;The real North.
601;00:49:15,581;00:49:18,748;Yes, well, the nights
601;00:49:15,581;00:49:18,748;have been getting longer
602;00:49:18,831;00:49:21,414;and there wasn't that much
602;00:49:18,831;00:49:21,414;to do in Oldtown.
603;00:49:21,497;00:49:24,122;There's only so many books
603;00:49:21,497;00:49:24,122;a person can read, so we--
604;00:49:24,205;00:49:26,914;I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam.
605;00:49:30,205;00:49:32,873;If it's a boy, we want to name him Jon.
606;00:49:36,205;00:49:37,706;I hope it's a girl.
607;00:49:56,539;00:49:58,664;You're the best friend I ever had.
608;00:50:01,122;00:50:03,164;You too, Sam.
609;00:51:03,706;00:51:05,997;Think of the past 20 years.
610;00:51:06,997;00:51:09,914;The war, the murder, the misery.
611;00:51:09,997;00:51:12,414;All of it because
611;00:51:09,997;00:51:12,414;Robert Baratheon loved someone
612;00:51:12,497;00:51:14,414;who didn't love him back.
613;00:51:16,497;00:51:17,664;How many others know?
614;00:51:19,456;00:51:22,080;Including us? Eight.
615;00:51:22,164;00:51:24,247;Well, then it's not a secret anymore.
616;00:51:24,331;00:51:26,122;It's information.
617;00:51:26,205;00:51:29,539;If a handful of people know now,
617;00:51:26,205;00:51:29,539;hundreds will know soon.
618;00:51:29,623;00:51:31,039;Then what happens?
619;00:51:31,122;00:51:32,706;She loses the North.
620;00:51:32,789;00:51:35,581;She loses the Vale,
620;00:51:32,789;00:51:35,581;Sansa will make sure of that.
621;00:51:35,664;00:51:37,080;No, it's worse than that.
622;00:51:37,164;00:51:39,914;He has the better claim to the throne.
623;00:51:39,997;00:51:42,205;He doesn't want the throne.
624;00:51:42,289;00:51:44,706;I'm not sure it matters what he wants.
625;00:51:45,914;00:51:49,164;The fact is, people are drawn to him.
626;00:51:49,247;00:51:50,955;Wildlings, Northmen.
627;00:51:52,955;00:51:54,205;He's a war hero.
628;00:51:58,664;00:52:00,831;He loves our queen.
629;00:52:02,372;00:52:03,664;And she loves him.
630;00:52:05,873;00:52:08,289;If we marry them,
630;00:52:05,873;00:52:08,289;they could rule together.
631;00:52:09,331;00:52:10,497;She's his aunt.
632;00:52:10,581;00:52:11,914;That never stopped a Targaryen before.
633;00:52:11,997;00:52:13,706;No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell.
634;00:52:13,789;00:52:16,039;Is marrying your aunt
634;00:52:13,789;00:52:16,039;common in the North?
635;00:52:18,789;00:52:20,456;You know our queen better than I do.
636;00:52:20,539;00:52:23,247;Do you think
636;00:52:20,539;00:52:23,247;she wants to share the throne?
637;00:52:23,331;00:52:25,873;She does not like to have
637;00:52:23,331;00:52:25,873;her authority questioned.
638;00:52:25,955;00:52:27,205;Something she has in common
639;00:52:27,289;00:52:29,873;with every monarch who ever lived.
640;00:52:29,955;00:52:31,748;I worry about her state of mind.
641;00:52:31,831;00:52:33,955;We are advisors to the queen.
642;00:52:34,039;00:52:37,372;Worrying about her state of mind
642;00:52:34,039;00:52:37,372;is our job.
643;00:52:45,331;00:52:47,372;We still have to take King's Landing.
644;00:52:48,539;00:52:51,122;Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all.
645;00:52:51,205;00:52:53,497;That would solve our problems.
646;00:54:57,039;00:54:59,497;Get to the skiff. Now!
647;00:55:01,581;00:55:03,039;Spears!
648;00:55:03,122;00:55:05,080;They're coming round again!
649;00:55:13,706;00:55:15,164;Go!
650;00:55:15,247;00:55:16,456;Clear!
651;00:55:16,539;00:55:18,414;Man your stations!
652;00:55:18,497;00:55:20,164;No!
653;00:55:38,080;00:55:40,664;Go! Go!
653;00:55:38,080;00:55:40,664;Clear!
654;00:56:16,372;00:56:17,456;Missandei?
655;00:56:19,039;00:56:20,289;Missandei!
656;00:56:26,372;00:56:27,789;Missandei!
657;00:56:32,706;00:56:34,706;Our message was well-received, then?
658;00:56:34,789;00:56:38,080;Your people have
658;00:56:34,789;00:56:38,080;heard the Usurper is coming.
659;00:56:38,164;00:56:40,664;They are grateful for your protection
660;00:56:40,748;00:56:43,122;within the walls of the Red Keep.
661;00:56:45,372;00:56:47,331;You're certain about the dragon?
662;00:56:47,414;00:56:49,664;I saw it sink beneath the waves.
663;00:56:49,748;00:56:51,997;That must have been glorious.
664;00:56:54,205;00:56:56,331;The glory is yours, my queen.
665;00:56:57,831;00:57:00,331;When the war is won,
665;00:56:57,831;00:57:00,331;the Lion shall rule the land,
666;00:57:00,414;00:57:02,080;the Kraken shall rule the sea...
667;00:57:03,456;00:57:06,664;and our child
667;00:57:03,456;00:57:06,664;shall one day rule them all.
668;00:57:23,497;00:57:25,205;She's coming for you.
669;00:57:26,331;00:57:27,539;Of course she is.
670;00:57:30,331;00:57:32,039;Keep the gates open.
671;00:57:32,122;00:57:34,748;If she wants to take the castle,
671;00:57:32,122;00:57:34,748;she'll have to murder
672;00:57:34,831;00:57:37,331;thousands of innocent people first.
673;00:57:43,414;00:57:45,914;So much for
673;00:57:43,414;00:57:45,914;the Breaker of Chains.
674;00:57:59,456;00:58:01,914;We will storm the city, my queen.
675;00:58:01,997;00:58:05,205;We will kill your enemies.
675;00:58:01,997;00:58:05,205;All of them.
676;00:58:05,289;00:58:06,372;Your Grace.
677;00:58:07,955;00:58:11,623;I promised you I would look you
677;00:58:07,955;00:58:11,623;in the eye and speak directly
678;00:58:11,706;00:58:14,039;if I ever thought
678;00:58:11,706;00:58:14,039;you were making a mistake.
679;00:58:17,581;00:58:20,331;This is a mistake.
680;00:58:22,873;00:58:25,414;You saw my child fall from the sky.
681;00:58:27,039;00:58:29,039;They took Missandei.
682;00:58:29,122;00:58:31,122;Cersei needs to be destroyed,
683;00:58:31,205;00:58:35,414;but if we attack King's Landing
683;00:58:31,205;00:58:35,414;with Drogon and the Unsullied
684;00:58:35,497;00:58:36,706;and the Dothraki,
685;00:58:36,789;00:58:38,955;tens of thousands
685;00:58:36,789;00:58:38,955;of innocents will die.
686;00:58:39,039;00:58:43,748;That is why Cersei is bringing
686;00:58:39,039;00:58:43,748;them into the Red Keep.
687;00:58:43,831;00:58:47,497;These are the people
687;00:58:43,831;00:58:47,497;you came here to protect.
688;00:58:47,581;00:58:49,205;I beg you, Your Grace.
689;00:58:49,289;00:58:52,997;Do not destroy the city
689;00:58:49,289;00:58:52,997;you came to save.
690;00:58:53,080;00:58:56,914;Do not become what you
690;00:58:53,080;00:58:56,914;have always struggled to defeat.
691;00:59:01,748;00:59:04,789;Do you believe we're here
691;00:59:01,748;00:59:04,789;for a reason, Lord Varys?
692;00:59:08,247;00:59:11,331;I'm here to free the world
692;00:59:08,247;00:59:11,331;from tyrants.
693;00:59:12,497;00:59:13,955;That is my destiny...
694;00:59:15,289;00:59:18,247;and I will serve it,
694;00:59:15,289;00:59:18,247;no matter the cost.
695;00:59:25,205;00:59:28,039;It could be a fortnight before
695;00:59:25,205;00:59:28,039;Jon and the allied armies
696;00:59:28,122;00:59:30,122;make it to King's Landing.
697;00:59:30,205;00:59:33,039;In the meantime,
697;00:59:30,205;00:59:33,039;demand Cersei surrender.
698;00:59:33,122;00:59:36,456;Offer her her life
698;00:59:33,122;00:59:36,456;in exchange for the throne.
699;00:59:37,997;00:59:40,497;If there's a chance
699;00:59:37,997;00:59:40,497;to avoid the coming slaughter,
700;00:59:40,581;00:59:42,997;we should make the effort.
701;00:59:43,080;00:59:45,955;Speaking to Cersei
701;00:59:43,080;00:59:45,955;will not prevent a slaughter.
702;00:59:48,205;00:59:49,789;But perhaps it's good the people see
703;00:59:49,873;00:59:53,873;that Daenerys Stormborn made
703;00:59:49,873;00:59:53,873;every effort to avoid bloodshed,
704;00:59:53,955;00:59:56,289;and Cersei Lannister refused.
705;00:59:57,997;00:59:59,414;They should know whom to blame
706;00:59:59,497;01:00:01,623;when the sky falls down upon them.
707;01:00:15,789;01:00:18,372;I've served tyrants most of my life.
708;01:00:19,372;01:00:22,581;They all talk about destiny.
709;01:00:22,664;01:00:25,914;She's a girl who walked
709;01:00:22,664;01:00:25,914;into a fire with three stones
710;01:00:25,997;01:00:28,664;and walked out with three dragons.
711;01:00:28,748;01:00:31,497;How could she not believe in destiny?
712;01:00:31,581;01:00:33,456;Perhaps that's the problem.
713;01:00:33,539;01:00:34,748;Her life has convinced her
714;01:00:34,831;01:00:36,706;that she was sent here to save us all.
715;01:00:36,789;01:00:38,706;And how do you know she wasn't?
716;01:00:40,955;01:00:42,873;Then there's the problem of Jon Snow.
717;01:00:49,372;01:00:52,164;Perhaps it's actually a solution.
718;01:00:53,706;01:00:55,122;You know them both.
719;01:00:55,205;01:00:58,331;Tell me, who do you think
719;01:00:55,205;01:00:58,331;would make a better ruler?
720;01:01:03,623;01:01:05,372;He doesn't want the throne.
721;01:01:05,456;01:01:07,914;That's why he bent the knee.
722;01:01:07,997;01:01:10,080;Have you considered the best ruler
723;01:01:10,164;01:01:12,581;might be someone
723;01:01:10,164;01:01:12,581;who doesn't want to rule?
724;01:01:12,664;01:01:14,955;We're discussing treason.
725;01:01:15,039;01:01:17,706;Don't pretend
725;01:01:15,039;01:01:17,706;you haven't thought about it.
726;01:01:17,789;01:01:21,122;Of course I've thought about it.
726;01:01:17,789;01:01:21,122;Thoughts aren't treason.
727;01:01:23,205;01:01:27,247;He's temperate and measured.
727;01:01:23,205;01:01:27,247;He's a man,
728;01:01:27,331;01:01:30,080;which makes him more appealing
728;01:01:27,331;01:01:30,080;to the lords of Westeros,
729;01:01:30,164;01:01:32,414;whose support we are going to need.
730;01:01:32,497;01:01:33,914;Joffrey was a man.
731;01:01:33,997;01:01:36,247;I don't think a cock
731;01:01:33,997;01:01:36,247;is a true qualification,
732;01:01:36,331;01:01:37,456;as I'm sure you'd agree.
733;01:01:37,539;01:01:39,497;And he's the heir to the throne.
734;01:01:39,581;01:01:43,581;Yes, because he's a man.
734;01:01:39,581;01:01:43,581;Cocks are important, I'm afraid.
735;01:01:46,456;01:01:49,497;What about my earlier proposal?
736;01:01:49,581;01:01:51,789;They could rule together
736;01:01:49,581;01:01:51,789;as king and queen.
737;01:01:53,414;01:01:55,748;She's too strong for him.
738;01:01:55,831;01:01:59,372;She'd bend him to her will,
738;01:01:55,831;01:01:59,372;as she already has.
739;01:01:59,456;01:02:02,539;He could temper her worst impulses.
740;01:02:02,623;01:02:04,581;As you have?
741;01:02:07,664;01:02:09,831;You're drinking quite a lot.
742;01:02:12,247;01:02:15,873;A Targaryen father and a Stark mother.
743;01:02:15,955;01:02:18,873;Jon's the one man alive
743;01:02:15,955;01:02:18,873;who might actually be able
744;01:02:18,955;01:02:20,831;to keep the North
744;01:02:18,955;01:02:20,831;in the Seven Kingdoms.
745;01:02:20,914;01:02:22,497;How many kings and queens
745;01:02:20,914;01:02:22,497;have you served?
746;01:02:22,581;01:02:23,955;Five? Six? I've lost count.
747;01:02:24,039;01:02:25,831;You've always known my reasons.
747;01:02:24,039;01:02:25,831;At a certain point,
748;01:02:25,914;01:02:27,539;you choose a person you believe in,
749;01:02:27,623;01:02:29,122;and you fight for that person.
750;01:02:29,205;01:02:31,289;Even if you know it's a mistake?
751;01:02:33,122;01:02:34,831;I believe in our queen.
752;01:02:37,372;01:02:39,581;She'll make the right choice.
753;01:02:41,164;01:02:44,039;With the help of her loyal advisors.
754;01:02:47,789;01:02:50,164;You know where my loyalty stands.
755;01:02:50,247;01:02:52,539;You know I will never betray the realm.
756;01:02:52,623;01:02:53,914;What is the realm?
757;01:02:53,997;01:02:56,122;A vast continent,
757;01:02:53,997;01:02:56,122;home to millions of people,
758;01:02:56,205;01:02:58,164;most of whom don't care
758;01:02:56,205;01:02:58,164;who sits on the Iron Throne.
759;01:02:58,247;01:03:00,205;Millions of people,
759;01:02:58,247;01:03:00,205;many of whom will die
760;01:03:00,289;01:03:02,955;if the wrong person
760;01:03:00,289;01:03:02,955;sits on that throne.
761;01:03:03,039;01:03:04,247;We don't know their names,
762;01:03:04,331;01:03:06,205;but they're just as real as you and I.
763;01:03:06,289;01:03:07,497;They deserve to live.
764;01:03:07,581;01:03:09,497;They deserve food for their children.
765;01:03:13,247;01:03:17,539;I will act in their interest,
765;01:03:13,247;01:03:17,539;no matter the personal cost.
766;01:03:19,664;01:03:22,331;So, what happens to her?
767;01:03:30,289;01:03:31,497;Please.
768;01:03:33,789;01:03:34,873;Don't.
769;01:03:39,539;01:03:42,039;I've spoken as honestly as I can.
770;01:03:43,539;01:03:46,247;Each of us has a choice to make.
771;01:03:47,289;01:03:50,247;I pray we choose wisely.
772;01:04:01,164;01:04:02,997;I'm just about to start it.
773;01:04:03,080;01:04:04,497;Good luck.
774;01:04:04,581;01:04:06,497;Protect shell right up to the wall.
775;01:04:06,581;01:04:08,164;All right, I'll put another one on it.
776;01:04:08,247;01:04:10,080;He's headed down to the cellar.
777;01:04:10,164;01:04:12,205;I'll need a cart over here.
778;01:04:12,289;01:04:13,497;That's it, thanks.
779;01:04:13,581;01:04:15,164;Thank you.
780;01:04:15,247;01:04:16,581;It's really heavy, mind you.
781;01:04:16,664;01:04:17,914;We need some more water.
782;01:04:17,997;01:04:19,581;Take it down there!
783;01:04:24,497;01:04:26,914;...as are the rest
783;01:04:24,497;01:04:26,914;of her advisors.
784;01:04:29,247;01:04:30,289;What happened?
785;01:04:35,914;01:04:40,289;Euron Greyjoy ambushed
785;01:04:35,914;01:04:40,289;Queen Daenerys and her fleet.
786;01:04:40,372;01:04:43,331;One of the dragons was killed,

787;01:04:43,414;01:04:45,581;Missandei captured.
788;01:04:47,456;01:04:51,623;I always wanted to be there
788;01:04:47,456;01:04:51,623;when they execute your sister.
789;01:04:51,706;01:04:54,414;Seems like I won't get the chance.
790;01:06:01,164;01:06:03,789;They're going to destroy that city.
791;01:06:04,831;01:06:06,331;You know they will.
792;01:06:06,414;01:06:08,706;Have you ever run away from a fight?
793;01:06:10,664;01:06:13,080;You're not like your sister.
793;01:06:10,664;01:06:13,080;You're not.
794;01:06:13,164;01:06:15,289;You're better than she is.
795;01:06:15,372;01:06:17,914;You're a good man
795;01:06:15,372;01:06:17,914;and you can't save her.
796;01:06:17,997;01:06:19,914;You don't need to die with her.
797;01:06:19,997;01:06:21,539;Stay here.
798;01:06:23,414;01:06:24,748;Stay with me.
799;01:06:26,456;01:06:28,414;Please.
800;01:06:29,497;01:06:30,497;Stay.
801;01:06:37,164;01:06:38,997;You think I'm a good man?
802;01:06:43,748;01:06:46,456;I pushed a boy out a tower window,
803;01:06:46,539;01:06:48,623;crippled him for life
804;01:06:48,706;01:06:49,706;for Cersei.
805;01:06:52,789;01:06:55,748;I strangled my cousin with my own hands
806;01:06:56,748;01:06:58,873;just to get back to Cersei.
807;01:07:01,873;01:07:03,205;I would have murdered
808;01:07:03,289;01:07:07,497;every man, woman and child in Riverrun
809;01:07:07,581;01:07:08,706;for Cersei.
810;01:07:17,581;01:07:19,414;She's hateful.
811;01:07:21,289;01:07:22,539;And so am I.
812;01:09:57,623;01:09:58,581;My lord.
813;01:10:01,914;01:10:04,955;Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's
813;01:10:01,914;01:10:04,955;unconditional surrender
814;01:10:05,039;01:10:07,748;and the immediate release
814;01:10:05,039;01:10:07,748;of Missandei of Naath.

816;01:10:13,914;01:10:17,955;of Naath will die here and now.

818;01:10:22,080;01:10:23,873;you're a rational man.
819;01:10:23,955;01:10:26,914;Or so I flatter myself, my lord.
820;01:10:26,997;01:10:28,456;We have a chance here,
821;01:10:29,706;01:10:33,205;perhaps our last chance,
821;01:10:29,706;01:10:33,205;to avoid carnage.
822;01:10:33,289;01:10:34,289;Yes.
823;01:10:36,039;01:10:36,997;Help me.
824;01:10:38,205;01:10:41,080;I don't want to see this city burn.
825;01:10:41,164;01:10:44,456;I don't want to hear the screams
825;01:10:41,164;01:10:44,456;of children burning alive.
826;01:10:46,456;01:10:49,414;No, it is not a pleasant sound.
827;01:10:51,623;01:10:53,789;I-- I don't want to hear it.
828;01:10:54,789;01:10:56,289;Help me save this city.
829;01:10:58,247;01:11:00,914;My lord, I am only a mouthpiece
829;01:10:58,247;01:11:00,914;for our queen.
830;01:11:00,997;01:11:02,706;Your queen.
831;01:11:02,789;01:11:04,914;Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
832;01:11:04,997;01:11:06,122;You are her subject.
833;01:11:06,205;01:11:08,247;Her reign is over.
834;01:11:08,331;01:11:10,873;You understand this.
834;01:11:08,331;01:11:10,873;Help her understand it.
835;01:11:10,955;01:11:13,497;We understand nothing of the sort.
836;01:11:14,831;01:11:17,372;Your queen's last dragon is vulnerable.
837;01:11:17,456;01:11:20,372;Your armies
837;01:11:17,456;01:11:20,372;are battle-weary and depleted,
838;01:11:20,456;01:11:23,748;while ours have been reinforced
838;01:11:20,456;01:11:23,748;with the Golden Compan--
839;01:11:41,623;01:11:43,789;Ready!
840;01:11:43,873;01:11:44,914;Nock!
841;01:11:47,789;01:11:48,997;Draw!
842;01:12:55,289;01:12:58,122;I know you don't care
842;01:12:55,289;01:12:58,122;about your people.
843;01:13:00,080;01:13:01,873;Why should you?
844;01:13:03,372;01:13:06,955;They hate you and you hate them.
845;01:13:12,456;01:13:14,914;But you're not a monster.
846;01:13:16,955;01:13:18,164;I know this.
847;01:13:20,289;01:13:23,122;I know this because I've seen it.
848;01:13:26,997;01:13:29,456;You've always loved your children.
849;01:13:31,456;01:13:32,955;More than yourself,
850;01:13:33,955;01:13:35,414;more than Jaime...
851;01:13:38,205;01:13:39,664;more than anything.
852;01:13:42,623;01:13:44,289;I beg you.
853;01:13:46,497;01:13:49,955;If not for yourself,
853;01:13:46,497;01:13:49,955;then for your child.
854;01:13:53,497;01:13:56,039;Your reign is over,
855;01:13:56,122;01:13:59,122;but that doesn't mean
855;01:13:56,122;01:13:59,122;your life has to end.
856;01:14:01,997;01:14:04,873;It doesn't mean your baby has to die.
857;01:14:52,706;01:14:56,372;If you have any last words,
857;01:14:52,706;01:14:56,372;now is the time.
858;01:15:21,122;01:15:22,414;Dracarys.
859;01:15:31,623;01:15:33,247;No.
