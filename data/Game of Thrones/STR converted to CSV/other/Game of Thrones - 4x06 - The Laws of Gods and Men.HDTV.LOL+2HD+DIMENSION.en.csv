292;00:22:24,059;00:22:27,028;oversaw the restoration
293;00:22:27,062;00:22:29,364;and maintenance
293;00:22:27,062;00:22:29,364;of its greatest landmarks.
294;00:22:29,398;00:22:30,915;This pyramid included.
295;00:22:30,950;00:22:33,118;For that, he has my gratitude.
296;00:22:33,152;00:22:34,819;I should be honored to meet him.
297;00:22:34,854;00:22:36,304;You have, Your Grace.
298;00:22:36,338;00:22:38,139;You crucified him.
299;00:22:40,376;00:22:42,410;I pray you'll never live to see
300;00:22:42,461;00:22:44,412;a member of your family
300;00:22:42,461;00:22:44,412;treated so cruelly.
301;00:22:44,463;00:22:47,982;Your father crucified
301;00:22:44,463;00:22:47,982;innocent children.
302;00:22:48,050;00:22:51,469;My father spoke out against
302;00:22:48,050;00:22:51,469;crucifying those children.
303;00:22:51,504;00:22:54,706;He decried it as a criminal
303;00:22:51,504;00:22:54,706;act, but was overruled.
304;00:22:54,740;00:22:58,076;Is it justice to answer
304;00:22:54,740;00:22:58,076;one crime with another?
305;00:22:58,144;00:23:00,562;I am sorry you no longer
305;00:22:58,144;00:23:00,562;have a father,
306;00:23:00,596;00:23:03,932;but my treatment
306;00:23:00,596;00:23:03,932;of the masters was no crime.
307;00:23:03,983;00:23:06,751;You'd be wise to remember that.
308;00:23:06,785;00:23:09,737;What's done is done.
309;00:23:09,772;00:23:12,907;You are the queen and I
309;00:23:09,772;00:23:12,907;am a servant of Meereen.
310;00:23:12,942;00:23:16,611;A servant who does not wish to
310;00:23:12,942;00:23:16,611;see its traditions eradicated.
311;00:23:16,613;00:23:19,447;And what traditions
311;00:23:16,613;00:23:19,447;do you speak of?
312;00:23:19,449;00:23:21,449;The tradition of funeral rite.
313;00:23:21,500;00:23:23,785;Proper burial in
313;00:23:21,500;00:23:23,785;the Temple of the Graces.
314;00:23:23,836;00:23:28,373;My father and 162
314;00:23:23,836;00:23:28,373;noble Meereenese
315;00:23:28,424;00:23:30,758;are still nailed to those posts,
316;00:23:30,793;00:23:33,962;carrion for vultures,
316;00:23:30,793;00:23:33,962;rotting in the sun.
317;00:23:43,172;00:23:46,024;Your Grace, I ask that you
317;00:23:43,172;00:23:46,024;order these men taken down
318;00:23:46,058;00:23:48,276;so that they might receive
318;00:23:46,058;00:23:48,276;proper burials.
319;00:23:48,310;00:23:52,480;And what of the slave children
319;00:23:48,310;00:23:52,480;these noble Meereenese crucified?
320;00:23:52,482;00:23:54,983;They were rotting
320;00:23:52,482;00:23:54,983;in the sun as well.
321;00:23:54,985;00:23:58,653;Would you have begged me for
321;00:23:54,985;00:23:58,653;their right to a proper burial?
322;00:23:58,704;00:24:01,406;Your Grace, I cannot defend
322;00:23:58,704;00:24:01,406;the actions of the masters.
323;00:24:01,490;00:24:05,376;I can only speak to you as a
323;00:24:01,490;00:24:05,376;son who loved his father.
324;00:24:05,411;00:24:07,662;Let me take his body down.
325;00:24:07,664;00:24:10,548;Let me have him brought
325;00:24:07,664;00:24:10,548;to the temple
326;00:24:10,583;00:24:12,083;and buried with dignity
327;00:24:12,134;00:24:14,502;so that he might find
327;00:24:12,134;00:24:14,502;peace in the next world.
328;00:24:17,740;00:24:21,392;Bury your father,
328;00:24:17,740;00:24:21,392;Hizdahr zo Loraq.
329;00:24:25,180;00:24:28,399;Thank you, my queen.
330;00:24:39,945;00:24:41,379;How many more?
331;00:24:41,413;00:24:44,699;There are 212 supplicants
331;00:24:41,413;00:24:44,699;waiting, Your Grace.
332;00:24:44,783;00:24:47,535;212?
333;00:24:55,010;00:24:57,512;Send the next one in.
334;00:24:59,431;00:25:02,133;These meetings aren't always going
334;00:24:59,431;00:25:02,133;to be this early, are they?
335;00:25:02,184;00:25:05,270;I was up late last night.
336;00:25:05,304;00:25:09,307;So, does this mean I am a
336;00:25:05,304;00:25:09,307;master of something now?
337;00:25:09,358;00:25:11,225;Coins, ships?
338;00:25:11,227;00:25:13,478;Lord Tywin and I
338;00:25:11,227;00:25:13,478;already determined
339;00:25:13,529;00:25:16,731;that I shall be the Master
339;00:25:13,529;00:25:16,731;of Ships long before you--
340;00:25:21,570;00:25:23,738;Lord Tywin, it's a great honor
341;00:25:23,789;00:25:26,240;to have been granted a
341;00:25:23,789;00:25:26,240;seat on this council. I--
342;00:25:26,242;00:25:28,242;Tywin: The trial
342;00:25:26,242;00:25:28,242;begins this afternoon.
343;00:25:28,294;00:25:30,461;We only have the morning
343;00:25:28,294;00:25:30,461;for affairs of state.
344;00:25:30,496;00:25:31,963;Shall we begin?
345;00:25:31,997;00:25:33,998;Varys: Sandor Clegane
345;00:25:31,997;00:25:33,998;has been spotted
346;00:25:34,049;00:25:36,834;in the Riverlands, my lord.
347;00:25:36,885;00:25:38,219;A coward and a traitor.
348;00:25:38,253;00:25:42,507;My birds tell me the Hound
348;00:25:38,253;00:25:42,507;slaughtered five of our soldiers.
349;00:25:42,558;00:25:45,259;I believe the phrase
349;00:25:42,558;00:25:45,259;«fuck the king» was uttered.
350;00:25:45,261;00:25:47,061;Disgraceful.
351;00:25:47,096;00:25:48,930;Tywin: What would it take
351;00:25:47,096;00:25:48,930;to make the common soldier
352;00:25:48,932;00:25:51,232;stupid enough to try
352;00:25:48,932;00:25:51,232;his luck with the Hound?
353;00:25:51,266;00:25:53,835;10 silver stags
353;00:25:51,266;00:25:53,835;seems a generous bounty.
354;00:25:53,869;00:25:56,688;Make it 100.
354;00:25:53,869;00:25:56,688;What else?
355;00:25:56,739;00:25:59,273;More whispers
355;00:25:56,739;00:25:59,273;from the east, my lord.
356;00:25:59,325;00:26:00,858;The Targaryen girl?
357;00:26:00,909;00:26:03,695;Daenerys has taken up
357;00:26:00,909;00:26:03,695;residence in Meereen.
358;00:26:03,746;00:26:07,348;She has conquered the city
358;00:26:03,746;00:26:07,348;and rules as its queen.
359;00:26:07,383;00:26:08,950;Conquered with what?
360;00:26:09,001;00:26:10,918;Varys: She commands an army
360;00:26:09,001;00:26:10,918;of Unsullied, my queen.
361;00:26:10,953;00:26:12,954;Some 8,000 strong.
362;00:26:12,988;00:26:15,289;She has a company
362;00:26:12,988;00:26:15,289;of sellswords--
363;00:26:15,291;00:26:16,674;the Second Sons.
364;00:26:16,709;00:26:19,127;She has two knights
364;00:26:16,709;00:26:19,127;advising her--
365;00:26:19,161;00:26:22,430;Jorah Mormont
365;00:26:19,161;00:26:22,430;and Barristan Selmy.
366;00:26:22,464;00:26:24,465;And she has three dragons.
367;00:26:24,516;00:26:25,933;Baby dragons.
368;00:26:25,968;00:26:28,102;Larger every year, Your Grace.
369;00:26:28,137;00:26:31,606;Mormont is spying on her for us.
370;00:26:31,640;00:26:34,609;No longer. He appears
370;00:26:31,640;00:26:34,609;to be fully devoted to her.
371;00:26:34,643;00:26:37,645;As for Ser Barristan,
371;00:26:34,643;00:26:37,645;it would seem
372;00:26:37,680;00:26:40,314;he took his dismissal
372;00:26:37,680;00:26:40,314;from the Kingsguard
373;00:26:40,316;00:26:42,150;a bit harder than anticipated.
374;00:26:42,152;00:26:44,068;He's an old man.
375;00:26:44,119;00:26:46,020;He wasn't fit to protect my son.
376;00:26:46,055;00:26:48,072;Joffrey didn't die on his watch.
377;00:26:48,123;00:26:51,409;Dismissing him was as
377;00:26:48,123;00:26:51,409;insulting as it was stupid.
378;00:26:51,460;00:26:54,562;Don't tell me you're worried about
378;00:26:51,460;00:26:54,562;a child halfway across the world.
379;00:26:54,596;00:26:58,166;A child with two seasoned
379;00:26:54,596;00:26:58,166;warriors counseling her
380;00:26:58,200;00:27:01,419;and a powerful army
380;00:26:58,200;00:27:01,419;at her back, Your Grace.
381;00:27:01,470;00:27:03,504;Lord Varys is right.
382;00:27:03,506;00:27:06,007;I have been to Essos and seen
382;00:27:03,506;00:27:06,007;the Unsullied firsthand.
383;00:27:06,058;00:27:09,577;They are very impressive
383;00:27:06,058;00:27:09,577;on the battlefield.
384;00:27:09,611;00:27:11,345;Less so in the bedroom.
385;00:27:11,347;00:27:14,182;Dragons haven't won
385;00:27:11,347;00:27:14,182;a war in 300 years.
386;00:27:14,184;00:27:16,734;Armies win them all the time.
387;00:27:16,769;00:27:19,020;She must be dealt with.
388;00:27:19,054;00:27:21,072;How, my lord?
389;00:27:21,106;00:27:22,440;By force?
390;00:27:22,491;00:27:24,509;Eventually, if it comes to that.
391;00:27:26,662;00:27:29,614;Can your little birds
391;00:27:26,662;00:27:29,614;find their way into Meereen?
392;00:27:29,648;00:27:31,666;Most certainly, my Lord Hand.
393;00:27:31,700;00:27:34,619;Mmm. Lord Tyrell,
393;00:27:31,700;00:27:34,619;be a good man.
394;00:27:34,670;00:27:36,370;Fetch my quill and paper.
395;00:27:48,133;00:27:51,219;(footsteps)
396;00:27:57,276;00:27:59,444;Prince Oberyn.
397;00:27:59,478;00:28:01,896;Lord Varys...
398;00:28:01,898;00:28:05,133;Only Varys.
398;00:28:01,898;00:28:05,133;I'm not actually a nobleman.
399;00:28:05,167;00:28:07,702;No one is under obligation
399;00:28:05,167;00:28:07,702;to call me lord.
400;00:28:07,736;00:28:09,570;And yet everyone does.
401;00:28:12,074;00:28:14,542;You seem quite knowledgeable
401;00:28:12,074;00:28:14,542;about the Unsullied.
402;00:28:14,576;00:28:16,494;Did you spend much time
402;00:28:14,576;00:28:16,494;in Essos?
403;00:28:16,578;00:28:19,213;Five years.
404;00:28:19,248;00:28:20,832;May I ask why?
405;00:28:20,883;00:28:23,718;'Tis a big and beautiful world.
406;00:28:23,752;00:28:26,420;Most of us live and die
407;00:28:26,422;00:28:28,139;in the same corner
407;00:28:26,422;00:28:28,139;where we were born
408;00:28:28,173;00:28:31,092;and never get to see any of it.
409;00:28:31,094;00:28:33,728;I don't want to be most of us.
410;00:28:33,762;00:28:35,763;Most of us aren't princes.
411;00:28:37,132;00:28:40,601;(chuckles)
411;00:28:37,132;00:28:40,601;You are from Essos.
412;00:28:41,820;00:28:43,488;Where? Lys?
413;00:28:44,807;00:28:46,524;I have an ear for accents.
414;00:28:46,575;00:28:48,242;I've lost my accent entirely.
415;00:28:48,277;00:28:49,777;I have an ear for that as well.
416;00:28:51,663;00:28:53,831;How did you get here?
417;00:28:53,866;00:28:55,449;It's a long story.
418;00:28:55,534;00:28:58,452;One you don't like

420;00:29:01,124;00:29:04,208;My paramour Ellaria, she would
420;00:29:01,124;00:29:04,208;find you very interesting.
421;00:29:04,259;00:29:06,544;You should come to
421;00:29:04,259;00:29:06,544;the brothel and meet her.
422;00:29:06,595;00:29:09,630;We brought our own wine, not
422;00:29:06,595;00:29:09,630;the swill they serve here.

537;00:36:59,101;00:37:01,602;I asked him to confine

568;00:39:21,376;00:39:23,961;your own son to death?
569;00:39:23,995;00:39:26,163;I've condemned no one.
569;00:39:23,995;00:39:26,163;The trial is not over.
570;00:39:26,214;00:39:27,714;This isn't a trial.
570;00:39:26,214;00:39:27,714;It's a farce.

572;00:39:30,084;00:39:31,502;I know nothing of the sort.
573;00:39:31,553;00:39:34,054;— You've always hated Tyrion.
573;00:39:31,553;00:39:34,054;— He killed his king.
574;00:39:34,088;00:39:35,923;As did I.
575;00:39:35,925;00:39:38,509;Do you know the last order
575;00:39:35,925;00:39:38,509;the Mad King gave me?
576;00:39:38,543;00:39:41,411;To bring him your head.
577;00:39:41,479;00:39:43,931;I saved your life so you
577;00:39:41,479;00:39:43,931;could murder my brother?
578;00:39:43,933;00:39:46,733;— It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
578;00:39:43,933;00:39:46,733;— Justice?
579;00:39:46,768;00:39:49,937;I'm performing my sworn
579;00:39:46,768;00:39:49,937;duty as Hand of the King.

581;00:39:53,074;00:39:55,642;— No, he'll be punished accordingly.
582;00:39:57,946;00:40:01,248;Once you said family
582;00:39:57,946;00:40:01,248;is what lives on.
583;00:40:01,282;00:40:03,283;All that lives on.
584;00:40:03,285;00:40:06,787;You told me about a dynasty
584;00:40:03,285;00:40:06,787;that would last 1,000 years.
585;00:40:06,838;00:40:09,706;What happens to your dynasty
585;00:40:06,838;00:40:09,706;when Tyrion dies?
586;00:40:10,959;00:40:12,626;I'm a Kingsguard,

595;00:40:29,444;00:40:31,662;if I spare the life
595;00:40:29,444;00:40:31,662;of my grandson's killer?
596;00:40:31,696;00:40:34,281;It survives through me.
597;00:40:36,818;00:40:38,652;I'll leave the Kingsguard.

602;00:40:51,000;00:40:52,749;Tyrion will be given
602;00:40:51,000;00:40:52,749;the chance to speak.
603;00:40:52,800;00:40:56,803;He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow

616;00:41:54,145;00:41:56,613;— You're going to be found guilty.
616;00:41:54,145;00:41:56,613;— Oh, you think so?
617;00:41:56,648;00:41:59,399;When you are, you need to

618;00:41:59,450;00:42:01,702;and ask to be sent to the Wall.
619;00:42:01,736;00:42:03,704;Father's agreed to it.
