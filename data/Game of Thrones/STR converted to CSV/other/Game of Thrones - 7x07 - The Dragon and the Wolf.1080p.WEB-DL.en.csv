413;00:36:06,420;00:36:08,170;Yes.
413;00:36:06,420;00:36:08,170;Why?
414;00:36:08,171;00:36:09,753;Because I think

419;00:36:19,171;00:36:22,503;instead of feeding them.
420;00:36:22,504;00:36:24,503;That's the difference

485;00:41:32,129;00:41:34,128;Perhaps Jon tried
485;00:41:32,129;00:41:34,128;to send word earlier.
486;00:41:34,129;00:41:37,544;No, this is
486;00:41:34,129;00:41:37,544;the way he is,
487;00:41:37,545;00:41:39,920;the way
487;00:41:37,545;00:41:39,920;he's always been.
488;00:41:39,921;00:41:42,544;He never asked for my opinion.
488;00:41:39,921;00:41:42,544;Why would he start now?
489;00:41:42,545;00:41:46,295;I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern
489;00:41:42,545;00:41:46,295;crown without consulting you.
490;00:41:46,296;00:41:48,711;This is his writing,
490;00:41:46,296;00:41:48,711;his signature.
491;00:41:48,712;00:41:51,878;He pledged to fight
491;00:41:48,712;00:41:51,878;for Daenerys Targaryen.
492;00:41:51,879;00:41:53,961;He's bent the knee.
493;00:41:53,962;00:41:56,544;I've heard gossip
494;00:41:56,545;00:42:00,544;that the Dragon Queen
494;00:41:56,545;00:42:00,544;is quite beautiful.
495;00:42:00,545;00:42:02,754;What does that have to do
495;00:42:00,545;00:42:02,754;with anything?
496;00:42:05,046;00:42:07,795;Jon is young
496;00:42:05,046;00:42:07,795;and unmarried.
497;00:42:07,796;00:42:10,003;Daenerys is young
497;00:42:07,796;00:42:10,003;and unmarried.
498;00:42:10,004;00:42:12,961;You think he wants
498;00:42:10,004;00:42:12,961;to marry her?
499;00:42:12,962;00:42:16,212;An alliance
499;00:42:12,962;00:42:16,212;makes sense.
500;00:42:16,213;00:42:18,420;Together, they'd be
500;00:42:16,213;00:42:18,420;difficult to defeat.
501;00:42:20,046;00:42:23,046;He was named
501;00:42:20,046;00:42:23,046;King in the North.
502;00:42:25,462;00:42:26,879;He can be unnamed.
503;00:42:30,712;00:42:33,378;Even if I wanted to,
503;00:42:30,712;00:42:33,378;Arya would never go along.
504;00:42:33,379;00:42:36,212;She always loved Jon
504;00:42:33,379;00:42:36,212;far more than she ever loved me,
505;00:42:36,213;00:42:39,419;and she'd kill anyone
505;00:42:36,213;00:42:39,419;who betrayed her family.
506;00:42:39,420;00:42:41,420;You are family, too.
507;00:42:43,420;00:42:46,003;Would Arya really murder
507;00:42:43,420;00:42:46,003;her own sister?
508;00:42:46,004;00:42:48,337;Do you know
508;00:42:46,004;00:42:48,337;what she is now?
509;00:42:48,338;00:42:51,711;Do you know what
509;00:42:48,338;00:42:51,711;the Faceless Men are?
510;00:42:51,712;00:42:53,920;Only by reputation.
511;00:42:53,921;00:42:57,087;They worship
511;00:42:53,921;00:42:57,087;the God of Death, I believe.
512;00:42:57,088;00:42:59,711;I never trust
512;00:42:57,088;00:42:59,711;godly men.
513;00:42:59,712;00:43:01,212;They're killers.
514;00:43:01,213;00:43:03,088;And Arya
514;00:43:01,213;00:43:03,088;was one of them.
515;00:43:07,962;00:43:09,544;What do you think
515;00:43:07,962;00:43:09,544;she's after?
516;00:43:09,545;00:43:12,128;She's your sister.
517;00:43:12,129;00:43:14,254;You know her far better
517;00:43:12,129;00:43:14,254;than I ever could.
518;00:43:17,796;00:43:22,544;Sometimes when I try to understand
518;00:43:17,796;00:43:22,544;a person's motives,
519;00:43:22,545;00:43:24,462;I play a little game.
520;00:43:26,962;00:43:28,962;I assume the worst.
521;00:43:31,962;00:43:34,795;What's the worst reason
521;00:43:31,962;00:43:34,795;they could possibly have
522;00:43:34,796;00:43:39,753;for saying what they say
522;00:43:34,796;00:43:39,753;and doing what they do?
523;00:43:39,754;00:43:41,961;Then I ask myself,
524;00:43:41,962;00:43:45,128;How well does
524;00:43:41,962;00:43:45,128;that reason explain
525;00:43:45,129;00:43:48,088;what they say
525;00:43:45,129;00:43:48,088;and what they do?
526;00:43:49,921;00:43:51,461;So, tell me--
527;00:43:51,462;00:43:54,004;what's the worst thing
527;00:43:51,462;00:43:54,004;she could want?
528;00:43:58,837;00:44:01,836;She could
528;00:43:58,837;00:44:01,836;want me dead
529;00:44:01,837;00:44:05,045;because she thinks
529;00:44:01,837;00:44:05,045;I wronged my family.
530;00:44:05,046;00:44:07,338;Why did she come
530;00:44:05,046;00:44:07,338;to Winterfell?
531;00:44:10,545;00:44:12,503;To kill me
532;00:44:12,504;00:44:16,337;for marrying our enemies
532;00:44:12,504;00:44:16,337;and betraying my family.
533;00:44:16,338;00:44:19,338;Why did she unearth the letter
533;00:44:16,338;00:44:19,338;Cersei made you write?
534;00:44:22,046;00:44:26,128;To provide proof
534;00:44:22,046;00:44:26,128;of my betrayals.
535;00:44:26,129;00:44:30,878;To provide justification
535;00:44:26,129;00:44:30,878;after she murders me.
536;00:44:30,879;00:44:34,544;And after
536;00:44:30,879;00:44:34,544;she murders you,
537;00:44:34,545;00:44:37,213;what does she become?
538;00:44:42,712;00:44:44,420;Lady of Winterfell.

543;00:45:06,545;00:45:08,170;We can sail with them

547;00:45:17,088;00:45:19,586;You have many enemies

555;00:45:39,962;00:45:44,045;it's important for the Northerners

786;01:02:21,796;01:02:25,795;when we were young, they're all real.
787;01:02:25,796;01:02:27,503;So be it.
788;01:02:27,504;01:02:29,628;Let the monsters
788;01:02:27,504;01:02:29,628;kill each other.
789;01:02:29,629;01:02:31,878;And while they battle

791;01:02:34,296;01:02:37,087;And then what?
791;01:02:34,296;01:02:37,087;And then we rule.
792;01:02:37,088;01:02:40,003;When the fighting
792;01:02:37,088;01:02:40,003;in the North is over, someone wins.

795;01:02:45,670;01:02:48,753;and we've betrayed them,
796;01:02:48,754;01:02:50,711;they march south
796;01:02:48,754;01:02:50,711;and kill us all!
797;01:02:50,712;01:02:53,711;The Targaryens and the Starks

799;01:02:55,129;01:02:56,711;I faced them
799;01:02:55,129;01:02:56,711;in the field.
800;01:02:56,712;01:02:59,253;We can't beat them.
800;01:02:56,712;01:02:59,253;We can't beat their dragons.
801;01:02:59,254;01:03:00,795;How many dragons

802;01:03:00,796;01:03:02,795;Two.
802;01:03:00,796;01:03:02,795;What happened to the third?
803;01:03:02,796;01:03:05,295;For all we know,
803;01:03:02,796;01:03:05,295;it's guarding her fleet!

804;01:03:05,296;01:03:08,628;Dothraki and her Unsullied.
805;01:03:08,629;01:03:11,419;She came here to show us
805;01:03:08,629;01:03:11,419;all her power.
806;01:03:11,420;01:03:14,461;No, something happened.
806;01:03:11,420;01:03:14,461;The dragons are vulnerable.
807;01:03:14,462;01:03:17,003;We can't beat the Dothraki.
807;01:03:14,462;01:03:17,003;We don't have the numbers.
808;01:03:17,004;01:03:18,836;We don't have the support

809;01:03:18,837;01:03:21,504;No, we have something better.
809;01:03:18,837;01:03:21,504;We have the Iron Bank.
810;01:03:23,504;01:03:27,461;You should've listened more when Father
810;01:03:23,504;01:03:27,461;spoke about the importance of gold.
811;01:03:27,462;01:03:29,628;Oh, I know
811;01:03:27,462;01:03:29,628;it's boring for you.
812;01:03:29,629;01:03:33,253;You just wanted to hunt
812;01:03:29,629;01:03:33,253;and ride and fight.
813;01:03:33,254;01:03:35,836;But I listened,
813;01:03:33,254;01:03:35,836;I learned.
814;01:03:35,837;01:03:39,836;Highgarden bought us
814;01:03:35,837;01:03:39,836;the most powerful army in Essos--
815;01:03:39,837;01:03:41,628;the Golden Company.
816;01:03:41,629;01:03:45,337;20,000 men, horses,
816;01:03:41,629;01:03:45,337;elephants, I believe.
817;01:03:45,338;01:03:47,003;The Golden Company
817;01:03:45,338;01:03:47,003;is not here.
818;01:03:47,004;01:03:48,378;They're in Essos.
819;01:03:48,379;01:03:52,337;How is a mercenary company
819;01:03:48,379;01:03:52,337;in Essos going to help us?
820;01:03:52,338;01:03:54,836;Do you really think
820;01:03:52,338;01:03:54,836;Euron Greyjoy turned tail
821;01:03:54,837;01:03:56,462;and sailed back
821;01:03:54,837;01:03:56,462;to the Iron Islands?
822;01:03:57,587;01:03:58,961;Do you think
822;01:03:57,587;01:03:58,961;he abandoned
823;01:03:58,962;01:04:02,212;the chance to marry
823;01:03:58,962;01:04:02,212;the queen?

824;01:04:02,213;01:04:04,545;from me.
825;01:04:06,379;01:04:08,045;He's sailing with
825;01:04:06,379;01:04:08,045;his fleet to Essos.
826;01:04:08,046;01:04:10,128;He's going to ferry
826;01:04:08,046;01:04:10,128;the Golden Company back here
827;01:04:10,129;01:04:11,670;to help us win
827;01:04:10,129;01:04:11,670;the war for Westeros.
828;01:04:14,213;01:04:17,378;You plotted with Euron Greyjoy
828;01:04:14,213;01:04:17,378;without telling me,

832;01:04:23,213;01:04:24,544;your queen.
833;01:04:24,545;01:04:26,003;I didn't conspire
