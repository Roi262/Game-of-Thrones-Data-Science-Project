1;00:00:00,680;00:00:02,126;This march is a distraction.
2;00:00:02,635;00:00:05,905;My grandfather's funeral
2;00:00:02,635;00:00:05,905;is not a distraction.
3;00:00:05,939;00:00:08,774;Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
3;00:00:05,939;00:00:08,774;No.
4;00:00:08,809;00:00:10,277;Then it's a distraction.
5;00:00:10,311;00:00:12,813;They're growing fast.
5;00:00:10,311;00:00:12,813;Not fast enough.
6;00:00:12,847;00:00:15,215;I need an army.
7;00:00:15,250;00:00:16,984;We'll be in Astapor
7;00:00:15,250;00:00:16,984;by nightfall.
8;00:00:17,018;00:00:19,754;Some say the Unsullied are the
8;00:00:17,018;00:00:19,754;greatest soldiers in the world.
9;00:00:19,789;00:00:21,723;The greatest slave-soldiers
9;00:00:19,789;00:00:21,723;in the world.
10;00:00:21,757;00:00:24,492;- Who are you?
10;00:00:21,757;00:00:24,492;Thoros of Myr.
11;00:00:24,526;00:00:26,962;Who do you fight for?
11;00:00:24,526;00:00:26,962;The Brotherhood without Banners.
12;00:00:26,996;00:00:29,097;The lords of Westeros
12;00:00:26,996;00:00:29,097;want to burn the countryside.
13;00:00:29,132;00:00:30,566;We're trying to save it.
14;00:00:32,503;00:00:35,772;Your sister sent me.
14;00:00:32,503;00:00:35,772;Yara?
15;00:00:35,807;00:00:38,175;I'll come for you tonight
15;00:00:35,807;00:00:38,175;when the castle sleeps.
16;00:00:38,209;00:00:40,778;I have been searching
16;00:00:38,209;00:00:40,778;for you, Daenerys Stormborn,
17;00:00:40,812;00:00:42,145;to ask your forgiveness.
18;00:00:42,180;00:00:44,982;I am Barristan Selmy,
18;00:00:42,180;00:00:44,982;Kingsguard to your father.
19;00:00:45,016;00:00:46,850;I will not fail you again.
20;00:00:46,884;00:00:49,119;- What's wrong with him?
20;00:00:46,884;00:00:49,119;- He's a warg.
21;00:00:49,153;00:00:51,855;He can enter the mind of animals,
21;00:00:49,153;00:00:51,855;see through their eyes.
22;00:00:51,889;00:00:53,657;He's scouting for us.
23;00:00:53,691;00:00:55,592;Orell, where were you
23;00:00:53,691;00:00:55,592;this time?
24;00:00:55,626;00:00:57,494;The Fist of the First Men.
25;00:00:57,528;00:00:59,797;What did you see?
25;00:00:57,528;00:00:59,797;Dead crows.
26;00:00:59,831;00:01:03,501;Get up, Tarly.
26;00:00:59,831;00:01:03,501;I forbid you to die.
27;00:01:03,535;00:01:05,337;You're responsible for him.
28;00:01:05,371;00:01:07,406;Make sure he gets back alive.
29;00:01:08,809;00:01:10,777;So good to see you
29;00:01:08,809;00:01:10,777;again, Clegane.
30;00:01:10,811;00:01:13,413;Girl.
31;00:01:13,447;00:01:14,948;What in seven hells
32;00:01:14,982;00:01:17,150;are you doing
32;00:01:14,982;00:01:17,150;with the Stark bitch?
33;00:01:17,185;00:01:18,719;Get up.
34;00:01:21,489;00:01:23,857;Ah!
35;00:01:23,891;00:01:26,159;Let us go and my father will pay
35;00:01:23,891;00:01:26,159;you whatever you want.
36;00:01:26,193;00:01:28,828;Enough to buy me a new head?

39;00:05:36,348;00:05:38,916;I encountered a situation
39;00:05:36,348;00:05:38,916;with one of my lieutenants
40;00:05:38,951;00:05:41,152;at the Stone Mill
40;00:05:38,951;00:05:41,152;which may have some bearing--
41;00:05:41,219;00:05:44,488;Why don't you shut your mouth
41;00:05:41,219;00:05:44,488;about that damned mill?
42;00:05:44,522;00:05:47,357;And don't call him nephew.
42;00:05:44,522;00:05:47,357;He is your king.
43;00:05:47,391;00:05:48,825;Robb knows
43;00:05:47,391;00:05:48,825;I meant him no disr--
44;00:05:48,859;00:05:52,362;You're lucky I'm not your king.
45;00:05:52,397;00:05:54,561;I wouldn't let you wave
45;00:05:52,397;00:05:54,561;your blunders around
46;00:05:54,586;00:05:56,100;like a victory flag.
47;00:05:56,101;00:05:58,736;My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog
48;00:05:58,771;00:06:01,906;scurrying back to Casterly Rock with
48;00:05:58,771;00:06:01,906;his tail between his legs.
49;00:06:01,941;00:06:04,076;I think King Robb understands
49;00:06:01,941;00:06:04,076;we're not gonna win this war
50;00:06:04,110;00:06:05,744;if he's the only one
50;00:06:04,110;00:06:05,744;winning any battles.
51;00:06:05,779;00:06:07,259;No, there's glory enough
51;00:06:05,779;00:06:07,259;to go around.
52;00:06:07,280;00:06:09,148;It's not about glory.
53;00:06:10,984;00:06:13,586;Your instructions were to wait
53;00:06:10,984;00:06:13,586;for him to come to you.
54;00:06:13,620;00:06:15,054;I seized an opportunity.
55;00:06:15,088;00:06:16,989;What value was the mill?
56;00:06:17,023;00:06:19,224;The Mountain was garrisoned
56;00:06:17,023;00:06:19,224;across the river from it.
57;00:06:19,259;00:06:20,592;Is he there now?
58;00:06:20,627;00:06:22,828;Of course not.
58;00:06:20,627;00:06:22,828;We took the fight to him.
59;00:06:22,862;00:06:24,095;He could not withstand us.
60;00:06:24,130;00:06:27,331;I wanted to draw
60;00:06:24,130;00:06:27,331;the Mountain into the west,
61;00:06:27,366;00:06:31,569;into our country where
61;00:06:27,366;00:06:31,569;we could surround him and kill him.
62;00:06:31,603;00:06:33,705;I wanted him to chase us,
63;00:06:33,773;00:06:37,208;which he would have done
63;00:06:33,773;00:06:37,208;because he is a mad dog
64;00:06:37,242;00:06:39,443;without a strategic thought
64;00:06:37,242;00:06:39,443;in his head.
65;00:06:39,478;00:06:42,480;I could have that head
65;00:06:39,478;00:06:42,480;on a spike by now.
66;00:06:44,884;00:06:47,352;Instead, I have a mill.
67;00:06:50,122;00:06:51,756;We took hostages.
68;00:06:51,791;00:06:55,493;Willem Lannister.
68;00:06:51,791;00:06:55,493;Martyn Lannister.
69;00:06:55,528;00:06:58,030;Willem and Martyn Lannister
69;00:06:55,528;00:06:58,030;are 14 years old.
70;00:06:58,064;00:07:00,499;Martyn is 15, I believe.
71;00:07:03,870;00:07:07,908;Tywin Lannister has my sisters.
72;00:07:07,975;00:07:09,876;Have I sued for peace?
73;00:07:09,911;00:07:11,411;No.
74;00:07:11,445;00:07:12,846;Do you think
74;00:07:11,445;00:07:12,846;he'll sue for peace
75;00:07:12,880;00:07:15,983;because we have his father's
76;00:07:16,017;00:07:18,885;brother's
76;00:07:16,017;00:07:18,885;great-grandsons?
77;00:07:23,591;00:07:25,058;No.
78;00:07:25,092;00:07:27,093;How many men did you lose?
79;00:07:28,595;00:07:29,829;208.
80;00:07:29,863;00:07:32,131;But for every man we lost,
80;00:07:29,863;00:07:32,131;the Lannisters--
81;00:07:32,165;00:07:35,101;We need our men more
81;00:07:32,165;00:07:35,101;than Tywin needs his!
82;00:07:41,309;00:07:43,243;I'm sorry.
83;00:07:43,278;00:07:45,646;I didn't know.
83;00:07:43,278;00:07:45,646;You would have.
84;00:07:45,680;00:07:48,916;Right here today at this gathering
84;00:07:45,680;00:07:48,916;if you had been patient.
85;00:07:48,950;00:07:52,252;We seem to be running
85;00:07:48,950;00:07:52,252;short of patience here.
86;00:07:52,286;00:07:54,721;You know who isn't?
87;00:07:56,323;00:07:58,991;Tywin Lannister.
88;00:09:49,807;00:09:52,442;Intimate.
88;00:09:49,807;00:09:52,442;Lovely table.
89;00:09:52,476;00:09:55,278;Better chairs than the old
89;00:09:52,476;00:09:55,278;small council chamber.
90;00:09:55,313;00:09:58,748;Conveniently close
90;00:09:55,313;00:09:58,748;to your own quarters. I like it.
91;00:09:58,783;00:10:01,618;What news of Jaime?
92;00:10:05,622;00:10:07,890;20,000 unwashed Northerners
93;00:10:07,924;00:10:09,959;have known about
93;00:10:07,924;00:10:09,959;his escape for weeks.
94;00:10:09,993;00:10:12,361;Collectively, you control
94;00:10:09,993;00:10:12,361;more spies and informants
95;00:10:12,395;00:10:14,296;than the rest
95;00:10:12,395;00:10:14,296;of the world combined.
96;00:10:14,331;00:10:16,232;Do you mean to tell me
96;00:10:14,331;00:10:16,232;that none of you
97;00:10:16,266;00:10:18,368;has any notion of where he is?
98;00:10:18,402;00:10:21,371;We are trying, my lord.
98;00:10:18,402;00:10:21,371;Try harder.
99;00:10:23,708;00:10:25,642;What do we have, then?
100;00:10:25,677;00:10:28,546;Robb Stark and most of his
100;00:10:25,677;00:10:28,546;bannermen are in Riverrun
101;00:10:28,580;00:10:32,349;for the funeral of his grandfather
101;00:10:28,580;00:10:32,349;Lord Hoster Tully.
102;00:10:32,383;00:10:37,487;In Stark's absence,
102;00:10:32,383;00:10:37,487;Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal,
103;00:10:37,521;00:10:41,090;which would seem to make
103;00:10:37,521;00:10:41,090;him Lord of Harrenhal,
104;00:10:41,124;00:10:43,244;in practice if not in name.
104;00:10:41,124;00:10:43,244;Well, let him have it.
105;00:10:43,259;00:10:45,126;The name suits our purposes
106;00:10:45,194;00:10:48,163;far more than that
106;00:10:45,194;00:10:48,163;useless pile of rubble.
107;00:10:48,230;00:10:51,299;The Lord of Harrenhal will make a
107;00:10:48,230;00:10:51,299;worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.
108;00:10:51,334;00:10:54,269;For which I am extremely
108;00:10:51,334;00:10:54,269;grateful to you, my lord.
109;00:10:54,337;00:10:56,905;Lady Arryn and I have known
109;00:10:54,337;00:10:56,905;each other since we were children.
110;00:10:56,939;00:10:59,407;She has always been...
111;00:10:59,441;00:11:01,976;positively predisposed
111;00:10:59,441;00:11:01,976;toward me.
112;00:11:02,011;00:11:05,313;A successful courtship
112;00:11:02,011;00:11:05,313;would make Lord Baelish
113;00:11:05,348;00:11:07,148;acting Lord of the Vale.
114;00:11:07,182;00:11:10,018;Titles do seem to breed titles.
115;00:11:10,052;00:11:12,220;You'll leave for the Eyrie
115;00:11:10,052;00:11:12,220;as soon as possible
116;00:11:12,254;00:11:14,022;and bring Lysa Arryn
116;00:11:12,254;00:11:14,022;into the fold.
117;00:11:14,056;00:11:17,058;Then the young wolf can add
117;00:11:14,056;00:11:17,058;his own aunt to the list
118;00:11:17,093;00:11:18,927;of people who have
118;00:11:17,093;00:11:18,927;taken up arms against him.
119;00:11:18,961;00:11:21,764;Far be it from me
119;00:11:18,961;00:11:21,764;to hinder true love,
120;00:11:21,798;00:11:26,335;but Lord Baelish's absence
120;00:11:21,798;00:11:26,335;would present certain problems.
121;00:11:26,369;00:11:28,270;The royal wedding may end up
122;00:11:28,305;00:11:31,173;being the most expensive
122;00:11:28,305;00:11:31,173;event in living memory.
123;00:11:31,208;00:11:34,343;Summer has ended,
123;00:11:31,208;00:11:34,343;hard days lie ahead.
124;00:11:34,378;00:11:38,214;Not a good time to leave the
124;00:11:34,378;00:11:38,214;crown's finances unattended.
125;00:11:38,248;00:11:40,416;Fully agreed.
126;00:11:40,450;00:11:43,553;Which is why I'm naming you
126;00:11:40,450;00:11:43,553;new Master of Coin.
127;00:11:43,587;00:11:45,488;Master of Coin?
128;00:11:45,556;00:11:48,157;It would appear to be a position
128;00:11:45,556;00:11:48,157;that best suits your talents.
129;00:11:48,192;00:11:50,126;I'm quite good
129;00:11:48,192;00:11:50,126;at spending money,

189;00:14:25,682;00:14:27,616;A coward's weapon.
190;00:14:27,684;00:14:29,785;I like to fight up close.
191;00:14:29,820;00:14:33,256;I like to see a man's face
191;00:14:29,820;00:14:33,256;when I put the steel in him.
192;00:14:33,291;00:14:35,626;Why?
192;00:14:33,291;00:14:35,626;So you can kiss him?
193;00:14:35,660;00:14:37,761;You remember the last time

196;00:14:44,003;00:14:46,204;and I'd rather not
196;00:14:44,003;00:14:46,204;see you no more.
197;00:14:50,643;00:14:52,610;Watch your head.
198;00:14:52,645;00:14:54,045;Off we go.
199;00:14:54,079;00:14:57,382;Walk up!
200;00:15:01,186;00:15:03,487;What are you doing?
200;00:15:01,186;00:15:03,487;We're about to leave.
201;00:15:03,522;00:15:04,988;I'm staying.
202;00:15:07,192;00:15:09,560;You're what?
203;00:15:09,594;00:15:11,862;I baked some brown bread
203;00:15:09,594;00:15:11,862;for the innkeep
204;00:15:11,897;00:15:13,731;and she said
204;00:15:11,897;00:15:13,731;she never had better.
205;00:15:13,765;00:15:15,633;Told Thoros she's keeping me
205;00:15:13,765;00:15:15,633;as a payment
206;00:15:15,667;00:15:17,135;for all the free meals
206;00:15:15,667;00:15:17,135;she's given him.
207;00:15:17,169;00:15:19,337;Anyway, it's not me
207;00:15:17,169;00:15:19,337;the Brotherhood wants.
208;00:15:19,371;00:15:21,806;My brother ain't no king.

211;00:15:25,911;00:15:28,412;I'm sure.
212;00:15:30,615;00:15:33,584;Well, I made you something.
213;00:15:38,390;00:15:39,891;What is it?
214;00:15:39,925;00:15:42,160;It's a wolf.
215;00:15:46,298;00:15:48,232;Yes, it is.
216;00:15:49,334;00:15:50,868;That's the tail?
217;00:15:50,902;00:15:52,403;Yeah.
218;00:15:54,039;00:15:56,774;Well, be safe.
219;00:15:56,808;00:15:58,643;Yeah, you, too.
220;00:15:58,677;00:16:00,378;Don't get stabbed.
221;00:16:00,412;00:16:03,314;You don't...
222;00:16:03,348;00:16:05,183;burn your fingers.
223;00:16:15,294;00:16:17,662;Good-bye, Hot Pie.
224;00:16:17,696;00:16:19,964;Good-bye, Arry.
225;00:16:30,944;00:16:32,879;Up you go, little lady.
226;00:16:39,518;00:16:42,587;Hey, Hot Pie.
227;00:16:43,889;00:16:45,890;It's really good.
228;00:16:51,697;00:16:54,532;A person could
228;00:16:51,697;00:16:54,532;almost be forgiven
229;00:16:54,566;00:16:56,767;for forgetting we're at war.
230;00:16:59,271;00:17:03,607;It often comforts me to think
230;00:16:59,271;00:17:03,607;that even in war's darkest days,
231;00:17:03,641;00:17:05,476;in most places in the world
232;00:17:05,510;00:17:09,779;absolutely nothing
232;00:17:05,510;00:17:09,779;is happening.
233;00:17:12,250;00:17:14,151;I've missed you, Uncle.
234;00:17:14,185;00:17:16,153;Father missed you, too,
235;00:17:16,187;00:17:18,088;from the day you left.
236;00:17:18,122;00:17:20,290;Maybe he never said it
236;00:17:18,122;00:17:20,290;in so many words--
237;00:17:20,325;00:17:21,926;Maybe?
238;00:17:21,960;00:17:24,228;Your father
238;00:17:21,960;00:17:24,228;was a stubborn old ox.
239;00:17:24,263;00:17:26,030;I was surprised when he died.
240;00:17:26,064;00:17:28,833;Didn't think death
240;00:17:26,064;00:17:28,833;had the patience.
241;00:17:30,970;00:17:33,772;I'm glad you were with him.
242;00:17:33,806;00:17:35,673;I wish to the gods I had been.
243;00:17:38,277;00:17:41,079;Did you make peace in the end?
244;00:17:41,114;00:17:43,915;After 30 years of fighting,
245;00:17:43,949;00:17:46,351;I don't think he remembered
245;00:17:43,949;00:17:46,351;what started it.
246;00:17:46,385;00:17:50,121;He asked me to stop
246;00:17:46,385;00:17:50,121;calling myself Blackfish.
247;00:17:50,155;00:17:52,323;He said it was an old joke
248;00:17:52,358;00:17:54,859;and it was never funny
248;00:17:52,358;00:17:54,859;to begin with.
249;00:17:56,362;00:17:58,897;I told him people had been
249;00:17:56,362;00:17:58,897;calling me Blackfish
250;00:17:58,931;00:18:01,800;for so long, they don't
250;00:17:58,931;00:18:01,800;remember my real name.
251;00:18:05,872;00:18:08,140;Every time he would leave
251;00:18:05,872;00:18:08,140;for the capital
252;00:18:08,174;00:18:10,909;or fight in a campaign,
253;00:18:10,976;00:18:13,077;I'd see him off.
254;00:18:13,112;00:18:16,213;Wait for me,
254;00:18:13,112;00:18:16,213;little Cat, he'd say.
255;00:18:17,449;00:18:19,416;Wait for me
256;00:18:19,451;00:18:22,920;and I'll come back
256;00:18:19,451;00:18:22,920;to you.
257;00:18:22,954;00:18:25,489;And I would sit at this window
258;00:18:25,524;00:18:28,259;every day when the sun
258;00:18:25,524;00:18:28,259;came up, waiting.
259;00:18:31,596;00:18:34,431;I wonder
260;00:18:34,466;00:18:37,200;how many times
260;00:18:34,466;00:18:37,200;did Bran or Rickon
261;00:18:37,235;00:18:39,169;stare across the moors
261;00:18:37,235;00:18:39,169;of Winterfell
262;00:18:39,203;00:18:41,371;waiting for me to return.
263;00:18:41,405;00:18:44,874;I will never see them again.
264;00:18:47,344;00:18:50,046;You mustn't think it.
265;00:18:50,080;00:18:52,381;We don't know the truth.
266;00:18:52,416;00:18:55,084;They could be in hiding.
267;00:18:58,122;00:19:00,891;Robb believes they're alive.
268;00:19:00,925;00:19:03,060;And he must go on believing.
269;00:19:03,094;00:19:05,863;He's got to remain strong
269;00:19:03,094;00:19:05,863;if he's to prevail.
270;00:19:05,897;00:19:09,967;And you must remain
270;00:19:05,897;00:19:09,967;strong for him.
271;00:19:21,279;00:19:22,746;You're Robb Stark's wife.
272;00:19:22,781;00:19:25,249;Hold still.
273;00:19:26,785;00:19:28,519;Is it true
273;00:19:26,785;00:19:28,519;what they say about him?
274;00:19:28,553;00:19:32,122;I don't know.
274;00:19:28,553;00:19:32,122;What do they say about him?
275;00:19:32,157;00:19:34,425;That he can turn
275;00:19:32,157;00:19:34,425;into a wolf at night.
276;00:19:35,427;00:19:37,161;True.
277;00:19:37,195;00:19:39,430;And he eats the flesh
277;00:19:37,195;00:19:39,430;of his enemies.
278;00:19:39,464;00:19:41,432;True.
279;00:19:44,135;00:19:46,403;You're a Lannister, aren't you?
280;00:19:46,437;00:19:47,637;Martyn Lannister.
281;00:19:47,671;00:19:50,807;Martyn Lannister.
282;00:19:50,874;00:19:52,108;You've nothing to fear.
283;00:19:52,143;00:19:54,277;My husband
283;00:19:52,143;00:19:54,277;doesn't eat children.
284;00:19:56,013;00:19:58,381;Unless it's a full moon.
285;00:19:58,416;00:20:01,217;It's not a full moon
285;00:19:58,416;00:20:01,217;tonight, is it?
286;00:20:01,252;00:20:03,019;See?
287;00:20:03,054;00:20:05,289;Nothing to fear.
288;00:20:23,442;00:20:25,810;Always the artists.
289;00:20:45,233;00:20:47,668;It's only horses.
290;00:20:47,702;00:20:49,302;No men.
291;00:20:51,105;00:20:53,040;You said there was dead crows.
292;00:20:53,074;00:20:55,409;There was.
293;00:20:57,479;00:20:59,213;How many men were here?
294;00:20:59,247;00:21:01,449;About 300.
295;00:21:01,483;00:21:03,884;And you know
295;00:21:01,483;00:21:03,884;what those men are now?
296;00:21:07,756;00:21:10,958;We're all the same to them--
296;00:21:07,756;00:21:10,958;meat for their army.
297;00:21:12,293;00:21:14,895;Do you think anyone got away?
298;00:21:14,929;00:21:16,430;It's not impossible.
299;00:21:16,465;00:21:18,832;You don't go far
299;00:21:16,465;00:21:18,832;betting against Mormont.
300;00:21:18,867;00:21:21,168;But dead or alive,
301;00:21:21,202;00:21:23,337;he took a big gamble
301;00:21:21,202;00:21:23,337;coming north.
302;00:21:23,371;00:21:25,438;And he lost.
303;00:21:25,473;00:21:27,807;His best fighting men are dead.
304;00:21:27,842;00:21:31,044;And whether he's Lord Commander
304;00:21:27,842;00:21:31,044;of the Night's Watch
305;00:21:31,078;00:21:33,046;or a blue-eyed corpse,
306;00:21:33,080;00:21:35,882;he's a long way from home.
307;00:21:36,784;00:21:38,284;Tormund.
308;00:21:38,352;00:21:40,320;Climb the Wall.
309;00:21:40,354;00:21:43,423;Take Orell and 20 good men.
310;00:21:43,457;00:21:45,058;And take this one.
311;00:21:45,092;00:21:47,927;He knows Castle Black's
311;00:21:45,092;00:21:47,927;defenses better than any of us.
312;00:21:47,962;00:21:50,363;And if he's useful, good.
312;00:21:47,962;00:21:50,363;If not...
313;00:21:50,398;00:21:52,799;throw him off the Wall.
314;00:21:52,833;00:21:55,735;See if crows can fly.
315;00:21:55,769;00:21:59,072;We're finally going to war,
315;00:21:55,769;00:21:59,072;old friend?
316;00:21:59,106;00:22:00,674;Hide near Castle Black.
317;00:22:00,708;00:22:03,009;When I give the signal,
317;00:22:00,708;00:22:03,009;hit them in the night.
318;00:22:03,043;00:22:05,745;They've got a big old wall
318;00:22:03,043;00:22:05,745;to hide behind,
319;00:22:05,779;00:22:07,614;but it only guards one side.
320;00:22:09,050;00:22:10,817;We'll meet again.
320;00:22:09,050;00:22:10,817;Aye.
321;00:22:10,852;00:22:13,019;If you do your job.
321;00:22:10,852;00:22:13,019;Ah.
322;00:22:13,054;00:22:15,222;How will we see your signal?
323;00:22:15,256;00:22:17,958;Send your eagle above
323;00:22:15,256;00:22:17,958;the Wall every night.
324;00:22:17,993;00:22:20,761;When it's time, I'm going
324;00:22:17,993;00:22:20,761;to light the biggest fire
325;00:22:20,796;00:22:22,997;the North has ever seen.
326;00:22:49,727;00:22:51,828;Ghost?
327;00:23:05,075;00:23:08,777;What have we here?
327;00:23:05,075;00:23:08,777;Frozen crows?
328;00:23:08,812;00:23:10,813;We've come a long way.
329;00:23:13,117;00:23:15,585;Smaller flock
329;00:23:13,117;00:23:15,585;than you went north with.
330;00:23:15,619;00:23:17,721;We can talk inside.
331;00:23:17,755;00:23:20,857;Oh, can we?
332;00:23:40,510;00:23:43,446;They need some water.
333;00:23:43,480;00:23:45,649;Tether it and I'll be inside.
334;00:24:01,365;00:24:03,432;Keep your eyes
334;00:24:01,365;00:24:03,432;where they belong.
335;00:24:03,467;00:24:06,001;They're not for you.
336;00:24:06,035;00:24:08,503;Bet you feed that pig
336;00:24:06,035;00:24:08,503;better than you feed us.
337;00:24:08,538;00:24:11,974;Aye, pig's got value to me.
338;00:24:12,008;00:24:15,877;You should all be kissing
338;00:24:12,008;00:24:15,877;my feet for letting you in.
339;00:24:17,213;00:24:20,049;I'd have turned you all away
339;00:24:17,213;00:24:20,049;if I wasn't a godly man.
340;00:24:20,083;00:24:22,417;You are a godly man?
341;00:24:22,451;00:24:25,888;I am.
341;00:24:22,451;00:24:25,888;I got no fear of what's out there.
342;00:24:25,922;00:24:27,923;When the white cold comes,
343;00:24:27,957;00:24:32,094;your swords and cloaks
343;00:24:27,957;00:24:32,094;and bloody fires won't help you.
344;00:24:32,128;00:24:36,365;The only ones left will be
344;00:24:32,128;00:24:36,365;those who are right with the gods.
345;00:24:36,399;00:24:37,966;The real gods.
346;00:24:43,773;00:24:46,241;Go tell her she can
346;00:24:43,773;00:24:46,241;bite down on a rag
347;00:24:46,276;00:24:48,944;or she can bite down
347;00:24:46,276;00:24:48,944;on my fist.
348;00:24:52,015;00:24:55,451;Women.
349;00:24:55,485;00:24:57,353;That sow right there gave birth
350;00:24:57,387;00:24:59,688;to a litter of eight.
351;00:24:59,723;00:25:01,857;Barely a grunt.
352;00:25:01,892;00:25:06,228;And she's almost as fat
352;00:25:01,892;00:25:06,228;as this one here.
353;00:25:06,263;00:25:08,831;Now why don't you dine on him?
354;00:25:08,865;00:25:11,500;Carve off what you need
354;00:25:08,865;00:25:11,500;as you go.
355;00:25:11,534;00:25:14,669;Well, look at him.
355;00:25:11,534;00:25:14,669;He's a walking feast.
356;00:25:32,021;00:25:34,155;Here we are.
357;00:25:34,189;00:25:36,558;Sharpen these for me, would ya?
358;00:25:54,444;00:25:56,145;I see the head.
358;00:25:54,444;00:25:56,145;Push.
359;00:25:56,179;00:25:58,947;That's it.
360;00:25:58,982;00:26:01,317;You're nearly there.
361;00:26:05,689;00:26:07,723;One more push should do it.
362;00:26:17,702;00:26:20,037;What is it?
362;00:26:17,702;00:26:20,037;What is it?
363;00:26:52,003;00:26:54,004;Keep quiet.
364;00:27:23,236;00:27:26,071;If you can't ride,
364;00:27:23,236;00:27:26,071;we don't stand a chance.
365;00:27:26,106;00:27:28,140;I can ride.
366;00:27:28,175;00:27:30,443;You're sure?
367;00:27:43,990;00:27:46,225;Ride east.
367;00:27:43,990;00:27:46,225;Follow the rising sun.
368;00:27:46,259;00:27:48,661;Your sister's waiting for you.
369;00:27:48,695;00:27:51,396;I'll make you a Lord
369;00:27:48,695;00:27:51,396;of the Iron Islands for this.
370;00:27:51,431;00:27:52,591;We're not in the Iron Islands.
371;00:27:52,599;00:27:55,167;Go.
371;00:27:52,599;00:27:55,167;Come on.
372;00:27:55,201;00:27:56,802;Come on.
372;00:27:55,201;00:27:56,802;Come on.
373;00:27:56,836;00:27:58,770;Come on. Come on.
374;00:28:02,675;00:28:04,643;Come on back.
375;00:28:08,381;00:28:10,548;You refuse to tell me
375;00:28:08,381;00:28:10,548;where you're going?
376;00:28:10,616;00:28:13,684;I don't know yet.
376;00:28:10,616;00:28:13,684;The fires will show me.
377;00:28:13,719;00:28:16,453;How long will you be gone?
377;00:28:13,719;00:28:16,453;I don't know.
378;00:28:18,023;00:28:19,156;You're abandoning me.
379;00:28:19,190;00:28:21,358;I will never abandon you.
380;00:28:23,161;00:28:25,329;You are the Son of Fire.
381;00:28:25,363;00:28:27,898;I am sworn to serve you.
381;00:28:25,363;00:28:27,898;Then serve me.
382;00:28:27,932;00:28:30,100;When I return,
382;00:28:27,932;00:28:30,100;you will understand.
383;00:28:32,537;00:28:34,705;My enemies think
383;00:28:32,537;00:28:34,705;they've destroyed me.
384;00:28:36,608;00:28:38,776;They're laughing at me
385;00:28:38,810;00:28:42,313;the way Renly laughed at me.
386;00:28:42,347;00:28:44,915;I want Joffrey dead.
387;00:28:44,950;00:28:47,452;I want Robb Stark dead.
388;00:28:50,990;00:28:53,057;Make me another son.
389;00:28:53,092;00:28:54,692;I cannot.
390;00:28:54,727;00:28:55,927;Why?
391;00:28:55,961;00:28:58,997;You don't have the strength.
391;00:28:55,961;00:28:58,997;It would kill you.
392;00:28:59,031;00:29:01,900;I'm not so easily killed.
392;00:28:59,031;00:29:01,900;Men have been trying for years.
393;00:29:06,706;00:29:09,074;I want you.
394;00:29:22,324;00:29:25,660;Your fires burn low, my king.
395;00:29:28,797;00:29:32,600;There is another way.
395;00:29:28,797;00:29:32,600;A better way.
396;00:29:32,634;00:29:35,202;You told me your magic
396;00:29:32,634;00:29:35,202;requires a king's blood.
397;00:29:35,236;00:29:36,837;Yes.
397;00:29:35,236;00:29:36,837;I'm the one true king.
398;00:29:36,871;00:29:38,438;You are.
399;00:29:38,473;00:29:40,707;But there are others
399;00:29:38,473;00:29:40,707;with your blood in their veins.
400;00:29:43,378;00:29:45,913;You will sit
400;00:29:43,378;00:29:45,913;on the Iron Throne,
401;00:29:45,947;00:29:48,082;but first there must
401;00:29:45,947;00:29:48,082;be sacrifices.
402;00:29:48,116;00:29:50,918;The Lord of Light demands it.
403;00:30:02,364;00:30:04,865;The Walk of Punishment
403;00:30:02,364;00:30:04,865;is a warning, Your Grace.
404;00:30:04,899;00:30:08,001;To whom?
404;00:30:04,899;00:30:08,001;To any slave who contemplates doing
405;00:30:08,035;00:30:10,703;whatever these slaves did.
406;00:30:10,737;00:30:13,239;Give me your water.
407;00:30:13,273;00:30:16,976;Khaleesi, this man
407;00:30:13,273;00:30:16,976;has been sentenced to death.
408;00:30:22,616;00:30:25,251;Here, drink.
409;00:30:27,588;00:30:29,822;Leave this place, Your Grace.
410;00:30:29,857;00:30:31,424;Leave tonight, I beg you.
411;00:30:31,492;00:30:32,959;And what is she
411;00:30:31,492;00:30:32,959;to do for soldiers?
412;00:30:32,994;00:30:36,462;We can find sellswords
412;00:30:32,994;00:30:36,462;in Pentos and Myr.
413;00:30:36,530;00:30:39,966;Is it we already,
413;00:30:36,530;00:30:39,966;Ser Barristan?
414;00:30:40,000;00:30:43,803;If you want to sit on the throne your
414;00:30:40,000;00:30:43,803;ancestors built, you must win it.
415;00:30:43,837;00:30:46,039;That will mean blood on your
415;00:30:43,837;00:30:46,039;hands before the thing is done.
416;00:30:46,073;00:30:49,275;The blood of my enemies,
416;00:30:46,073;00:30:49,275;not the blood of innocents.
417;00:30:51,679;00:30:54,814;How many wars have you
417;00:30:51,679;00:30:54,814;fought in, Ser Barristan?
418;00:30:54,848;00:30:57,082;Three.
418;00:30:54,848;00:30:57,082;Have you ever seen a war
419;00:30:57,117;00:30:59,485;where innocents didn't die
419;00:30:57,117;00:30:59,485;by the thousands?
420;00:31:04,157;00:31:07,193;I was in King's Landing
420;00:31:04,157;00:31:07,193;after the sack, khaleesi.
421;00:31:07,227;00:31:10,362;You know what I saw?
421;00:31:07,227;00:31:10,362;Butchery.
422;00:31:10,397;00:31:12,765;Babies, children, old men.
423;00:31:12,833;00:31:15,201;More women raped
423;00:31:12,833;00:31:15,201;than you can count.
424;00:31:15,235;00:31:16,835;There's a beast in every man
425;00:31:16,870;00:31:19,839;and it stirs when you put
425;00:31:16,870;00:31:19,839;a sword in his hand.
426;00:31:19,906;00:31:22,241;But the Unsullied are not men.
427;00:31:22,275;00:31:23,909;They do not rape.
428;00:31:23,944;00:31:27,013;They do not put cities to the sword
428;00:31:23,944;00:31:27,013;unless they're ordered to do so.
429;00:31:27,047;00:31:31,717;If you buy them, the only men they'll
429;00:31:27,047;00:31:31,717;kill are those you want dead.
430;00:31:31,751;00:31:33,218;Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?
431;00:31:33,253;00:31:36,322;When your brother Rhaegar led
431;00:31:33,253;00:31:36,322;his army into battle at the Trident,
432;00:31:36,356;00:31:38,991;men died for him
432;00:31:36,356;00:31:38,991;because they believed in him,
433;00:31:39,025;00:31:40,726;because they loved him,
434;00:31:40,761;00:31:43,229;not because they'd been bought
434;00:31:40,761;00:31:43,229;at a slaver's auction.
435;00:31:45,165;00:31:47,800;I fought beside the last dragon
435;00:31:45,165;00:31:47,800;on that day, Your Grace.
436;00:31:49,536;00:31:51,638;I bled beside him.
437;00:31:51,672;00:31:55,208;Rhaegar fought valiantly,
437;00:31:51,672;00:31:55,208;Rhaegar fought nobly,
438;00:31:55,242;00:31:57,077;and Rhaegar died.
439;00:31:59,047;00:32:00,648;Did you know him well,
439;00:31:59,047;00:32:00,648;Ser Barristan?
440;00:32:00,682;00:32:05,219;I did, Your Grace.
440;00:32:00,682;00:32:05,219;Finest man I ever met.
441;00:32:05,287;00:32:07,455;I wish I had known him.
442;00:32:07,489;00:32:09,523;But he was not the last dragon.
443;00:32:20,458;00:32:21,515;All?
444;00:32:21,540;00:32:24,136;Did this one's ears

445;00:32:24,674;00:32:26,909;They did not.
445;00:32:24,674;00:32:26,909;I want to buy them all.

452;00:32:46,996;00:32:48,897;Yes. 8,000.
453;00:32:48,965;00:32:51,233;And the ones

459;00:33:08,651;00:33:10,519;I will have them all

460;00:33:10,553;00:33:11,744;Many will fall in battle.

491;00:35:20,950;00:35:23,218;Aegon Targaryen proved that.

514;00:36:23,377;00:36:26,846;And what about you?
514;00:36:23,377;00:36:26,846;You know that I'm taking you to war.

520;00:36:51,739;00:36:55,174;A surprising place to keep

521;00:36:55,209;00:36:57,310;I'm surprised you're surprised.
522;00:36:58,946;00:37:02,348;This is the safest place

523;00:37:02,383;00:37:04,284;Not for bastards.
524;00:37:04,318;00:37:06,620;That's all of them, my lord.
525;00:37:06,654;00:37:09,757;Thank you, my dear.

529;00:37:29,778;00:37:31,579;Only my life.
530;00:37:31,613;00:37:33,547;Not all that significant,
530;00:37:31,613;00:37:33,547;I'm afraid.
531;00:37:33,615;00:37:35,616;You should have him knighted.
532;00:37:35,650;00:37:38,819;If only the Master of Coin
532;00:37:35,650;00:37:38,819;had such power.

537;00:37:51,298;00:37:53,266;Oh, that.
538;00:37:53,334;00:37:56,469;Of course.
538;00:37:53,334;00:37:56,469;A simple misunderstanding.
539;00:37:56,503;00:37:58,271;Apparently, Her Grace believed
540;00:37:58,305;00:38:02,342;that you two had some sort
540;00:37:58,305;00:38:02,342;of special relationship.
541;00:38:02,410;00:38:05,312;We don't.
541;00:38:02,410;00:38:05,312;I did fuck her once.
542;00:38:05,346;00:38:07,380;I know.
542;00:38:05,346;00:38:07,380;But we don't.
543;00:38:07,415;00:38:09,049;I know.
544;00:38:09,083;00:38:10,784;But how would the queen
544;00:38:09,083;00:38:10,784;get that idea?
545;00:38:10,818;00:38:13,587;Why don't you ask her?
546;00:38:16,891;00:38:19,059;Any advice for me
546;00:38:16,891;00:38:19,059;on my new position?
547;00:38:19,094;00:38:22,029;Keep a low profile.
548;00:38:22,063;00:38:25,332;If I had a gold dragon
549;00:38:25,367;00:38:28,435;for every time I heard
549;00:38:25,367;00:38:28,435;that joke, I'd be richer than you are.
550;00:38:28,469;00:38:30,337;Well, you are richer than I am.
551;00:38:30,372;00:38:32,406;Good point.
552;00:38:32,441;00:38:35,776;They're only numbers.
552;00:38:32,441;00:38:35,776;Numbers on paper.
553;00:38:35,811;00:38:39,280;Once you understand that,
553;00:38:35,811;00:38:39,280;it's easy to make them behave.
554;00:38:39,314;00:38:40,849;Trivial even.
555;00:38:40,883;00:38:42,651;You want a real challenge?
556;00:38:42,685;00:38:44,086;Try whores.
557;00:38:44,120;00:38:46,689;I've tried quite a few.
558;00:38:46,723;00:38:49,191;Well, lots of work to do.
559;00:38:49,259;00:38:51,961;Enjoy the Eyrie.
560;00:38:51,995;00:38:53,996;Come on, I'm here later.
561;00:38:54,031;00:38:55,865;Come on.
562;00:38:59,436;00:39:00,937;Tonight, then.
563;00:39:03,473;00:39:04,974;Looks like dull reading.
564;00:39:05,008;00:39:07,276;You think all reading
564;00:39:05,008;00:39:07,276;is dull reading.
565;00:39:07,310;00:39:10,179;It's an opinion I share with
565;00:39:07,310;00:39:10,179;some of the finest men I know.
566;00:39:10,213;00:39:12,813;The secret history of the Seven
566;00:39:10,213;00:39:12,813;Kingdoms is written in these pages.
567;00:39:12,816;00:39:15,452;Unless Lord Twatbeard
567;00:39:12,816;00:39:15,452;made up a bunch of numbers
568;00:39:15,486;00:39:17,053;to hide what he's really up to.
569;00:39:17,088;00:39:19,122;Unless he made it all up, yes.
570;00:39:19,157;00:39:21,558;Podrick, do keep up.
570;00:39:19,157;00:39:21,558;Yes, my lord.
571;00:39:21,592;00:39:23,860;Podrick.
571;00:39:21,592;00:39:23,860;Yes, my lord?
572;00:39:23,895;00:39:27,264;After a long consultation
572;00:39:23,895;00:39:27,264;with my colleague Ser Bronn,
573;00:39:27,298;00:39:29,199;I finally found
573;00:39:27,298;00:39:29,199;a suitable reward
574;00:39:29,234;00:39:31,535;for the services you've
574;00:39:29,234;00:39:31,535;provided over and above
575;00:39:31,570;00:39:33,137;what might be
575;00:39:31,570;00:39:33,137;considered reasonable.
576;00:39:33,171;00:39:35,573;Tell me, Pod,
577;00:39:35,607;00:39:38,376;have you ever been
577;00:39:35,607;00:39:38,376;with a woman?
578;00:39:38,410;00:39:40,945;No, my lord.
578;00:39:38,410;00:39:40,945;Wonderful.
579;00:39:42,414;00:39:46,384;Genna specializes
579;00:39:42,414;00:39:46,384;in first-timers.
580;00:39:46,418;00:39:49,153;She's not bad with
580;00:39:46,418;00:39:49,153;second-timers, either.
581;00:39:49,187;00:39:51,155;Uh, my lord...
582;00:39:51,190;00:39:53,625;A fair enough repayment
582;00:39:51,190;00:39:53,625;for putting your spear
583;00:39:53,659;00:39:55,860;through my would-be killer's face,
583;00:39:53,659;00:39:55,860;wouldn't you say?
584;00:39:57,964;00:40:00,766;Now, as it happens,
585;00:40:00,800;00:40:03,302;Marei...
586;00:40:03,336;00:40:06,605;is quite the spear
586;00:40:03,336;00:40:06,605;handler herself.
587;00:40:06,640;00:40:10,176;She's here to thank you
587;00:40:06,640;00:40:10,176;for staying by my side
588;00:40:10,210;00:40:12,946;as the battle raged
588;00:40:10,210;00:40:12,946;all around me.
589;00:40:12,980;00:40:14,815;He's handsome.
590;00:40:14,849;00:40:18,152;You didn't tell me
590;00:40:14,849;00:40:18,152;he was handsome.
591;00:40:19,454;00:40:23,091;Kayla is famous
591;00:40:19,454;00:40:23,091;from here to Volantis
592;00:40:23,125;00:40:25,360;in certain circles.
593;00:40:25,395;00:40:27,996;One of four women in the world
594;00:40:28,031;00:40:31,767;who can perform a proper
594;00:40:28,031;00:40:31,767;Meereenese Knot.
595;00:40:31,801;00:40:34,870;My lord, I don't even...
596;00:40:34,905;00:40:36,639;She's here to thank you
597;00:40:36,673;00:40:39,408;for being a thoroughly
597;00:40:36,673;00:40:39,408;respectful fellow
598;00:40:39,443;00:40:42,245;who's never once failed
598;00:40:39,443;00:40:42,245;to address me as my lord.
599;00:40:45,582;00:40:47,450;Be back in time for my supper.
600;00:40:51,788;00:40:54,656;Pace yourself, lad.
601;00:40:54,691;00:40:57,125;For years I've heard
601;00:40:54,691;00:40:57,125;that Littlefinger
602;00:40:57,160;00:40:59,528;is a magician.
603;00:40:59,562;00:41:02,531;Whenever the crown needs money,
603;00:40:59,562;00:41:02,531;he rubs his hands together
604;00:41:02,565;00:41:05,200;and, poof, mountains of gold.
605;00:41:05,235;00:41:07,636;Let me guess.
605;00:41:05,235;00:41:07,636;He's not a magician.
606;00:41:07,671;00:41:09,605;No.
607;00:41:11,108;00:41:14,043;He's stealing it?
607;00:41:11,108;00:41:14,043;Worse, he's borrowing it.
608;00:41:15,011;00:41:16,679;What's wrong with that?
609;00:41:16,713;00:41:20,382;We can't afford to pay it back,
609;00:41:16,713;00:41:20,382;that's what's wrong with it.
610;00:41:20,417;00:41:22,751;The crown owes millions
610;00:41:20,417;00:41:22,751;to my father.
611;00:41:22,786;00:41:25,120;Seeing as it's his grandson's
611;00:41:22,786;00:41:25,120;ass on the throne,
612;00:41:25,155;00:41:27,122;I imagine he'll forgive
612;00:41:25,155;00:41:27,122;that debt.
613;00:41:27,157;00:41:29,457;Forgive a debt, my father?
614;00:41:29,492;00:41:31,926;For a man of the world,
614;00:41:29,492;00:41:31,926;you're strangely naive.
615;00:41:31,961;00:41:33,895;I've never borrowed
615;00:41:31,961;00:41:33,895;money before.
616;00:41:33,930;00:41:36,297;I'm not clear on the rules.
617;00:41:36,332;00:41:37,766;Well...
618;00:41:37,800;00:41:40,001;Ahem!
619;00:41:42,038;00:41:44,339;The basic principle is
620;00:41:44,373;00:41:45,874;I lend you money,
621;00:41:45,909;00:41:48,444;and after an agreed upon
621;00:41:45,909;00:41:48,444;period of time,
622;00:41:48,478;00:41:51,080;you return it with interest.
623;00:41:51,114;00:41:52,581;And what if I don't?
624;00:41:52,615;00:41:54,683;Well, you have to.
625;00:41:54,717;00:41:56,050;But what if I don't?
626;00:41:56,085;00:41:58,419;This is why
626;00:41:56,085;00:41:58,419;I don't lend you money.
627;00:41:58,454;00:42:01,956;Anyway, it's not my father
627;00:41:58,454;00:42:01,956;I'm worried about.
628;00:42:01,990;00:42:03,958;It's the Iron Bank of Braavos.
629;00:42:03,992;00:42:05,693;We owe them tens of millions.
630;00:42:05,727;00:42:10,230;If we fail to repay these loans,
630;00:42:05,727;00:42:10,230;the bank will fund our enemies.
631;00:42:10,265;00:42:13,400;One way or another,
631;00:42:10,265;00:42:13,400;they always get their gold back.
632;00:42:15,070;00:42:17,972;Ah, the return
632;00:42:15,070;00:42:17,972;of the conquering hero.
633;00:42:18,006;00:42:20,475;Does he have a little
633;00:42:18,006;00:42:20,475;jaunt in his step?
634;00:42:20,509;00:42:22,143;The lad's practically skipping.
635;00:42:22,177;00:42:23,845;You were gone a long time.
636;00:42:23,879;00:42:25,680;I trust you got
636;00:42:23,879;00:42:25,680;your money's worth.
637;00:42:25,715;00:42:27,348;Or should I say
637;00:42:25,715;00:42:27,348;my money's worth?
638;00:42:29,785;00:42:32,119;Oh, it was a gift, Podrick.
639;00:42:32,154;00:42:33,888;This is more than
639;00:42:32,154;00:42:33,888;I give you in a year.
640;00:42:33,922;00:42:36,891;He's a squire.
640;00:42:33,922;00:42:36,891;You don't pay him.
641;00:42:36,925;00:42:39,426;Oh, then it's much more
641;00:42:36,925;00:42:39,426;than I give you in a year.
642;00:42:39,460;00:42:41,361;They wouldn't take it, my lord.
643;00:42:42,696;00:42:44,864;Maybe they're trying
643;00:42:42,696;00:42:44,864;to curry some favor
644;00:42:44,899;00:42:46,266;with the new Master of Coin.
645;00:42:46,300;00:42:48,401;Have you ever known a whore
645;00:42:46,300;00:42:48,401;to turn down gold?
646;00:42:48,435;00:42:50,970;They were happy enough
646;00:42:48,435;00:42:50,970;to take it when I gave it to them.
647;00:42:51,004;00:42:52,705;What did you tell them?
648;00:42:52,739;00:42:54,306;I didn't tell them anything.
649;00:42:54,341;00:42:57,410;What did you do to them?
649;00:42:54,341;00:42:57,410;Lots of things.
650;00:42:57,444;00:42:59,378;And they seemed
650;00:42:57,444;00:42:59,378;to like these things?
651;00:42:59,413;00:43:00,947;Yes, my lord.
652;00:43:00,981;00:43:02,682;Of course
652;00:43:00,981;00:43:02,682;they seemed to like it.
653;00:43:02,716;00:43:04,217;They're paid
653;00:43:02,716;00:43:04,217;to seem to like it.
654;00:43:04,251;00:43:06,486;Only they weren't paid.
655;00:43:06,520;00:43:09,456;What are you saying?
655;00:43:06,520;00:43:09,456;These ladies enjoyed him so much,
656;00:43:09,490;00:43:12,091;they gave him
656;00:43:09,490;00:43:12,091;the time for free?
657;00:43:12,126;00:43:13,493;Is that what you're telling us?
658;00:43:18,065;00:43:19,332;Sit down, Podrick.
659;00:43:25,272;00:43:28,373;We're going to need details.
660;00:43:28,408;00:43:30,810;Copious details.
661;00:44:11,284;00:44:14,086;Come on!
661;00:44:11,284;00:44:14,086;Come on!
662;00:44:15,789;00:44:17,590;Come on!
663;00:44:17,624;00:44:19,659;Come on.
664;00:44:55,228;00:44:57,663;Ha! Ha!
665;00:45:45,715;00:45:48,150;You know how we deal
665;00:45:45,715;00:45:48,150;with runaways here, do you?
666;00:45:55,627;00:45:57,060;Take off his pants.
667;00:45:57,095;00:45:59,497;No! No!
668;00:45:59,531;00:46:01,165;No, no, no!
669;00:46:01,200;00:46:03,300;I'm gonna fuck you
669;00:46:01,200;00:46:03,300;into the dirt.
670;00:46:03,334;00:46:05,836;No, please!
670;00:46:03,334;00:46:05,836;No, no, no!
671;00:46:05,870;00:46:07,437;No, don't!
672;00:46:10,008;00:46:11,741;No, please!
673;00:46:11,776;00:46:14,377;No! No!
674;00:46:43,508;00:46:45,877;You little bastard.
675;00:46:55,720;00:46:57,755;Come, my lord.
676;00:47:00,158;00:47:03,761;You're a long way from home
676;00:47:00,158;00:47:03,761;and winter is coming.
677;00:47:29,486;00:47:31,888;I'll take the big bitch first.
678;00:47:31,922;00:47:35,291;When she's good and wet,
678;00:47:31,922;00:47:35,291;you lot can finish her off.
679;00:47:35,325;00:47:37,793;My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth.
680;00:47:37,827;00:47:40,162;Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me
681;00:47:40,196;00:47:42,865;to deliver Ser Jaime
681;00:47:40,196;00:47:42,865;to King's Landing.
682;00:47:42,899;00:47:44,833;Catelyn Stark's
682;00:47:42,899;00:47:44,833;a treasonous cunt.
683;00:47:44,867;00:47:46,835;Orders were to take
683;00:47:44,867;00:47:46,835;the Kingslayer alive.
684;00:47:46,869;00:47:49,037;Nobody said shit about you.
685;00:47:54,043;00:47:56,144;You're only making it worse.
686;00:48:00,283;00:48:02,918;Take her over there
686;00:48:00,283;00:48:02,918;where it's dark.
687;00:48:02,952;00:48:04,353;I'd like a little privacy.
688;00:48:05,455;00:48:08,390;Come on!
689;00:48:19,202;00:48:21,237;You know who she is, don't you?
690;00:48:24,809;00:48:27,177;A big dumb bitch
690;00:48:24,809;00:48:27,177;from who cares where.
691;00:48:29,747;00:48:31,314;Never been with
691;00:48:29,747;00:48:31,314;a woman that big.
692;00:48:31,349;00:48:34,117;She's Brienne of Tarth.
693;00:48:34,152;00:48:36,854;Her father
693;00:48:34,152;00:48:36,854;is Lord Selwyn Tarth.
694;00:48:36,888;00:48:38,489;Heard of Tarth?
695;00:48:39,725;00:48:41,358;I'm gonna cut your throat!
696;00:48:41,393;00:48:44,394;They call it the Sapphire Isle.
696;00:48:41,393;00:48:44,394;Do you know why?
697;00:48:44,429;00:48:47,431;Every sapphire in Westeros
698;00:48:47,465;00:48:48,999;was mined on Tarth.
699;00:48:49,033;00:48:52,503;Sapphires are gemstones.
700;00:48:52,537;00:48:55,839;The blue ones.
700;00:48:52,537;00:48:55,839;I know what they are.
701;00:48:55,874;00:48:59,610;Lord Selwyn would pay
701;00:48:55,874;00:48:59,610;his daughter's weight
702;00:48:59,644;00:49:02,346;in sapphires
702;00:48:59,644;00:49:02,346;if she's returned to him.
703;00:49:02,380;00:49:05,616;But only if she's alive,
704;00:49:05,650;00:49:08,552;her honor unbesmirched.
705;00:49:18,963;00:49:20,997;Bring her back here.
706;00:49:21,065;00:49:22,432;Yes, my lord.
707;00:49:22,466;00:49:24,968;Get up.
707;00:49:22,466;00:49:24,968;- Come on.
708;00:49:25,002;00:49:27,638;Come on, on your feet.
709;00:49:28,873;00:49:31,074;Unbesmirched.
710;00:49:32,576;00:49:34,811;Not defiled.
711;00:49:34,845;00:49:37,613;Fancy word for a fancy man.
712;00:49:38,715;00:49:41,350;I hated to read as a child,
713;00:49:41,384;00:49:44,186;but my father forced me
713;00:49:41,384;00:49:44,186;to study the books every morning
714;00:49:44,220;00:49:47,390;before I could practice
714;00:49:44,220;00:49:47,390;with sword or horse.
715;00:49:47,457;00:49:50,793;Two hours every day holed up in
715;00:49:47,457;00:49:50,793;the maester's chambers.
716;00:49:50,827;00:49:54,263;I learned a lot of fancy words.
717;00:49:54,297;00:49:56,499;I bet you did.
718;00:50:04,642;00:50:06,676;Your father,
719;00:50:06,711;00:50:09,579;he'd pay your weight
719;00:50:06,711;00:50:09,579;in gold to get you back?
720;00:50:11,081;00:50:14,017;You'll be a rich man
720;00:50:11,081;00:50:14,017;till the end of your days.
721;00:50:14,051;00:50:15,919;And your sons will be rich men
722;00:50:15,953;00:50:18,287;and their sons after them.
723;00:50:18,322;00:50:20,624;Lands, titles--
724;00:50:20,658;00:50:22,926;you'll have them all.
725;00:50:24,595;00:50:27,731;The North can't win this war.
726;00:50:27,765;00:50:30,333;You're a smart man.
726;00:50:27,765;00:50:30,333;You understand that.
727;00:50:30,368;00:50:32,068;We have the numbers.
727;00:50:30,368;00:50:32,068;We have the gold.
728;00:50:32,103;00:50:34,171;Aye, you have both.
729;00:50:35,706;00:50:38,642;Fighting bravely
729;00:50:35,706;00:50:38,642;for a losing cause
730;00:50:38,676;00:50:40,511;is admirable.
731;00:50:40,545;00:50:43,214;Fighting for a winning cause
732;00:50:43,248;00:50:45,749;is far more rewarding.
733;00:50:45,784;00:50:48,185;Hard to argue with that.
734;00:50:51,457;00:50:54,426;Now that we're speaking
734;00:50:51,457;00:50:54,426;together man to man,
735;00:50:54,460;00:50:58,664;I wonder if you need
735;00:50:54,460;00:50:58,664;to keep me chained to this tree.
736;00:50:58,698;00:51:01,100;I'm not asking to be freed
736;00:50:58,698;00:51:01,100;from my constraints,
737;00:51:01,134;00:51:04,937;but if I could sleep
737;00:51:01,134;00:51:04,937;lying down,
738;00:51:04,971;00:51:06,773;my back would thank you for it.
739;00:51:06,807;00:51:08,842;I'm not as young
740;00:51:08,876;00:51:11,544;and resilient as I was once.
741;00:51:11,579;00:51:13,580;None of us are.
742;00:51:15,883;00:51:18,085;Unchain Ser Jaime
742;00:51:15,883;00:51:18,085;from the tree.
743;00:51:18,119;00:51:20,554;Come on, men.
744;00:51:25,961;00:51:29,296;Suppose you'll be wanting
744;00:51:25,961;00:51:29,296;something to eat.
745;00:51:29,331;00:51:31,198;I'm famished, actually.
746;00:51:31,233;00:51:34,335;I think we've got a spare
746;00:51:31,233;00:51:34,335;partridge on the fire.
747;00:51:34,370;00:51:37,172;Well, I do like partridge.
748;00:51:42,612;00:51:46,582;Bring the bird over here
748;00:51:42,612;00:51:46,582;and the carving knife.
749;00:51:50,086;00:51:52,521;Will this work
749;00:51:50,086;00:51:52,521;as a table, my lord?
750;00:51:52,556;00:51:54,423;Oh, yes.
750;00:51:52,556;00:51:54,423;Yes, this will do nic--
751;00:51:54,458;00:51:56,559;ah!
752;00:51:56,593;00:51:58,761;On the stump.
753;00:52:04,434;00:52:08,070;You think you're
753;00:52:04,434;00:52:08,070;the smartest man there is.
754;00:52:09,806;00:52:13,174;That everyone alive
754;00:52:09,806;00:52:13,174;has to bow and scrape
755;00:52:13,209;00:52:15,310;and lick your boots.
756;00:52:15,344;00:52:17,845;My father--
756;00:52:15,344;00:52:17,845;And if you get in any trouble,
757;00:52:17,879;00:52:20,748;all you've got to do
757;00:52:17,879;00:52:20,748;is say my father
758;00:52:20,782;00:52:23,817;and that's it,
758;00:52:20,782;00:52:23,817;all your troubles are gone.
759;00:52:25,419;00:52:28,322;Don't.
759;00:52:25,419;00:52:28,322;Have you got something to say?
760;00:52:32,360;00:52:35,628;Careful. You don't want to say
760;00:52:32,360;00:52:35,628;the wrong thing.
761;00:52:38,966;00:52:41,668;You're nothing
761;00:52:38,966;00:52:41,668;without your daddy,
762;00:52:41,702;00:52:45,138;and your daddy ain't here.
763;00:52:45,172;00:52:47,607;Never forget that.
764;00:52:49,177;00:52:51,632;Here, this should
764;00:52:49,177;00:52:51,632;help you remember.
