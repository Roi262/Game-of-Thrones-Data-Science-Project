506;00:32:59,746;00:33:02,347;come to me before dawn,
507;00:33:02,381;00:33:05,283;and I will grant you
507;00:33:02,381;00:33:05,283;your old seat in the council.
508;00:33:06,452;00:33:09,253;I'll even name you
508;00:33:06,452;00:33:09,253;my heir
509;00:33:09,288;00:33:11,122;until a son
509;00:33:09,288;00:33:11,122;is born to me.
510;00:33:13,192;00:33:15,460;Otherwise I shall
510;00:33:13,192;00:33:15,460;destroy you.
511;00:33:19,198;00:33:20,899;Look across
511;00:33:19,198;00:33:20,899;those fields, brother.
512;00:33:20,933;00:33:23,569;Can you see
512;00:33:20,933;00:33:23,569;all those banners?
513;00:33:23,603;00:33:26,339;You think a few bolts
513;00:33:23,603;00:33:26,339;of cloth will make you King?
514;00:33:26,373;00:33:28,541;No.
515;00:33:28,576;00:33:31,712;The men holding those bolts
515;00:33:28,576;00:33:31,712;of cloth will make me King.
516;00:33:31,746;00:33:33,614;We shall see, Renly.
517;00:33:33,648;00:33:36,384;Come the dawn,
517;00:33:33,648;00:33:36,384;we shall see.
518;00:33:36,418;00:33:38,586;Look to your sins,
518;00:33:36,418;00:33:38,586;Lord Renly.
519;00:33:38,621;00:33:41,122;The night is dark
519;00:33:38,621;00:33:41,122;and full of terrors.
520;00:33:46,662;00:33:50,230;Would you believe
520;00:33:46,662;00:33:50,230;I loved him once?
521;00:34:10,619;00:34:12,620;I thought we were welcome.
522;00:34:12,654;00:34:15,523;If you heard a Dothraki horde
522;00:34:12,654;00:34:15,523;was approaching your city,
523;00:34:15,557;00:34:17,591;you might do the same,
523;00:34:15,557;00:34:17,591;Khaleesi.
524;00:34:19,961;00:34:21,995;Horde?
525;00:34:36,711;00:34:38,745;My name is Daenerys--
526;00:34:38,780;00:34:42,015;Daenerys Stormborn
526;00:34:38,780;00:34:42,015;of the House Targaryen.
527;00:34:42,050;00:34:44,084;You know me, My Lord?
528;00:34:44,118;00:34:46,754;Only by reputation,
528;00:34:44,118;00:34:46,754;Khaleesi.
529;00:34:46,788;00:34:50,324;And I'm no lord,
529;00:34:46,788;00:34:50,324;merely a humble merchant.
530;00:34:51,427;00:34:54,062;They call you
530;00:34:51,427;00:34:54,062;the Mother of Dragons.
531;00:34:54,096;00:34:56,064;And what should
531;00:34:54,096;00:34:56,064;I call you?
532;00:34:56,098;00:34:57,666;Oh, my name is quite long
533;00:34:57,700;00:35:00,269;and quite impossible
533;00:34:57,700;00:35:00,269;for foreigners to pronounce.
534;00:35:00,303;00:35:03,907;I am simply a trader
534;00:35:00,303;00:35:03,907;of spices.
535;00:35:03,941;00:35:07,277;But we are the Thirteen,
536;00:35:07,312;00:35:10,648;charged with the governance
536;00:35:07,312;00:35:10,648;and protection of Qarth,
537;00:35:10,682;00:35:14,385;the greatest city
537;00:35:10,682;00:35:14,385;that ever was or will be.
538;00:35:15,687;00:35:18,220;The beauty of
538;00:35:15,687;00:35:18,220;Quarth is legendary--
539;00:35:18,245;00:35:20,245;Qarth.
540;00:35:21,727;00:35:23,327;Qarth.
541;00:35:23,362;00:35:26,397;Might we see
541;00:35:23,362;00:35:26,397;the dragons?
542;00:35:31,003;00:35:34,405;My friend,
543;00:35:34,440;00:35:36,874;we have travelled
543;00:35:34,440;00:35:36,874;very far.
544;00:35:36,908;00:35:39,409;We have no food,
544;00:35:36,908;00:35:39,409;no water.
545;00:35:39,444;00:35:41,911;Once I see my people fed,
545;00:35:39,444;00:35:41,911;I would be honored--
546;00:35:41,946;00:35:44,781;Forgive me,
546;00:35:41,946;00:35:44,781;Mother of Dragons,
547;00:35:44,815;00:35:48,818;but no man alive has seen
547;00:35:44,815;00:35:48,818;a living dragon.
548;00:35:48,852;00:35:51,020;Some of my more
548;00:35:48,852;00:35:51,020;skeptical friends
549;00:35:51,054;00:35:54,490;refuse to believe
549;00:35:51,054;00:35:54,490;your children
550;00:35:54,524;00:35:56,425;even exist.
551;00:35:56,460;00:35:59,862;All we ask is the chance
551;00:35:56,460;00:35:59,862;to see for ourselves.
552;00:35:59,896;00:36:01,864;I am not a liar.
553;00:36:01,899;00:36:03,933;Oh, I don't think you are.
554;00:36:03,967;00:36:05,668;But as I've never
554;00:36:03,967;00:36:05,668;met you before,
555;00:36:05,702;00:36:08,905;my opinion on the matter
555;00:36:05,702;00:36:08,905;is of limited value.
556;00:36:10,441;00:36:12,876;Where I come from,
557;00:36:12,910;00:36:15,378;guests are treated
557;00:36:12,910;00:36:15,378;with respect,
558;00:36:15,413;00:36:18,715;not insulted
558;00:36:15,413;00:36:18,715;at the gates.
559;00:36:18,749;00:36:21,250;Then perhaps you should
559;00:36:18,749;00:36:21,250;return to where you come from.
560;00:36:21,285;00:36:23,486;We wish you well.
561;00:36:26,991;00:36:28,892;What are you doing?
562;00:36:28,926;00:36:31,727;You promised
562;00:36:28,926;00:36:31,727;to receive me.
563;00:36:32,829;00:36:34,230;We have received you.
564;00:36:34,264;00:36:36,966;Here we are,
564;00:36:34,264;00:36:36,966;and here you are.
565;00:36:37,000;00:36:40,904;If you do not let us in,
565;00:36:37,000;00:36:40,904;all of us will die.
566;00:36:40,938;00:36:43,640;Which we shall
566;00:36:40,938;00:36:43,640;deeply regret.
567;00:36:43,674;00:36:44,745;But Qarth did not become
568;00:36:44,770;00:36:46,890;the greatest city that
568;00:36:44,770;00:36:46,890;ever was or will be
569;00:36:46,911;00:36:50,581;by letting Dothraki savages
569;00:36:46,911;00:36:50,581;through its gates.
570;00:36:57,455;00:36:59,690;Khaleesi, please
570;00:36:57,455;00:36:59,690;be careful.
571;00:37:02,527;00:37:05,129;Thirteen!
572;00:37:05,163;00:37:07,665;When my dragons are grown,
573;00:37:07,699;00:37:10,801;we will take back
573;00:37:07,699;00:37:10,801;what was stolen from me
574;00:37:10,836;00:37:13,170;and destroy those
574;00:37:10,836;00:37:13,170;who have wronged me.
575;00:37:13,205;00:37:15,673;We will lay waste
575;00:37:13,205;00:37:15,673;to armies
576;00:37:15,707;00:37:18,408;and burn cities
576;00:37:15,707;00:37:18,408;to the ground.
577;00:37:18,443;00:37:22,412;Turn us away and we will
577;00:37:18,443;00:37:22,412;burn you first.
578;00:37:22,447;00:37:24,614;Ah.
579;00:37:24,649;00:37:27,417;You are a true
579;00:37:24,649;00:37:27,417;Targaryen.
580;00:37:27,452;00:37:30,587;Only, as you said
580;00:37:27,452;00:37:30,587;a moment ago,
581;00:37:30,621;00:37:32,222;if we don't let you
581;00:37:30,621;00:37:32,222;into the city,
582;00:37:32,257;00:37:34,758;you will all die.
582;00:37:32,257;00:37:34,758;And so...
583;00:37:34,792;00:37:37,427;Retreating in fear
583;00:37:34,792;00:37:37,427;from a little girl
584;00:37:37,461;00:37:39,629;is unbecoming
584;00:37:37,461;00:37:39,629;of the greatest city
585;00:37:39,663;00:37:41,231;that ever was
585;00:37:39,663;00:37:41,231;or will be.
586;00:37:41,265;00:37:44,802;The discussion is over,
586;00:37:41,265;00:37:44,802;Xaro Xhoan Daxos.
587;00:37:44,836;00:37:46,837;The Thirteen have spoken.
588;00:37:46,872;00:37:49,607;I am one of the Thirteen
589;00:37:49,641;00:37:52,076;and I am still speaking.
590;00:37:52,110;00:37:54,445;The girl threatens to burn
590;00:37:52,110;00:37:54,445;our city to the ground
591;00:37:54,479;00:37:57,648;and you would invite her in
591;00:37:54,479;00:37:57,648;for a cup of wine?
592;00:37:57,682;00:37:59,750;She is the Mother
592;00:37:57,682;00:37:59,750;of Dragons.
593;00:37:59,784;00:38:03,086;Do you expect her to watch
593;00:37:59,784;00:38:03,086;her people starve
594;00:38:03,120;00:38:05,221;without breathing fire?
595;00:38:05,256;00:38:07,824;I believe we can allow
595;00:38:05,256;00:38:07,824;a few Dothraki
596;00:38:07,858;00:38:10,426;through our gates
596;00:38:07,858;00:38:10,426;without dooming our city.
597;00:38:10,461;00:38:13,764;After all, here I am,
598;00:38:13,798;00:38:15,866;a savage from
598;00:38:13,798;00:38:15,866;the Summer Isles,
599;00:38:15,900;00:38:17,769;and Qarth still stands.
600;00:38:17,836;00:38:20,705;Our decision is final.
601;00:38:20,740;00:38:22,875;Very well.
602;00:38:25,145;00:38:27,747;I invoke Soumai.
603;00:38:31,585;00:38:34,252;I will vouch for her,

604;00:38:34,287;00:38:37,655;in accordance with the law.
605;00:38:43,662;00:38:45,662;Be it on your head.

615;00:40:33,639;00:40:36,307;We weren't expecting you

748;00:46:57,326;00:46:59,361;I've lived within
748;00:46:57,326;00:46:59,361;the law for 17--
749;00:46:59,395;00:47:01,796;I want you to be
749;00:46:59,395;00:47:01,796;a smuggler this time.
750;00:47:01,831;00:47:04,399;Any shore, any night.
751;00:47:04,434;00:47:06,168;What am I bringing
751;00:47:04,434;00:47:06,168;ashore?
752;00:47:06,203;00:47:08,037;The red woman.
753;00:47:09,740;00:47:11,908;No one must know
753;00:47:09,740;00:47:11,908;what you do
754;00:47:11,942;00:47:13,543;and we'll not speak
754;00:47:11,942;00:47:13,543;of this again.
755;00:47:13,578;00:47:17,113;I am true to Your Grace
755;00:47:13,578;00:47:17,113;and always will be,
756;00:47:17,148;00:47:20,116;but surely there are
756;00:47:17,148;00:47:20,116;other ways, cleaner ways.
757;00:47:20,151;00:47:22,585;Cleaner ways
757;00:47:20,151;00:47:22,585;don't win wars.
758;00:47:52,319;00:47:55,287;Are you afraid,

759;00:47:57,524;00:47:58,773;Someone once told me
760;00:47:58,798;00:48:01,196;the night is dark and
760;00:47:58,798;00:48:01,196;full of terrors.
761;00:48:02,895;00:48:05,597;You've carried more
761;00:48:02,895;00:48:05,597;unpleasant cargo in your time.
762;00:48:09,501;00:48:12,437;Are you a good man,
762;00:48:09,501;00:48:12,437;Ser Davos Seaworth?
763;00:48:12,471;00:48:14,431;I'd say my parts
763;00:48:12,471;00:48:14,431;are mixed, My Lady--
764;00:48:15,256;00:48:16,341;good and bad.
765;00:48:16,342;00:48:18,844;If half an onion
765;00:48:16,342;00:48:18,844;is black with rot,
766;00:48:18,878;00:48:20,779;it's a rotten onion.
767;00:48:20,814;00:48:23,516;A man is good
767;00:48:20,814;00:48:23,516;or he is evil.
768;00:48:23,550;00:48:25,417;And which are you?
768;00:48:23,550;00:48:25,417;Oh, good.
769;00:48:25,452;00:48:28,754;I'm a Knight myself
769;00:48:25,452;00:48:28,754;of sorts,

770;00:48:28,789;00:48:31,624;and life.
771;00:48:31,658;00:48:34,827;Well, that must be
771;00:48:31,658;00:48:34,827;very nice for you.
772;00:48:51,081;00:48:55,217;Do you love your wife?
772;00:48:51,081;00:48:55,217;I do.
773;00:48:55,252;00:48:57,553;Yet you have known
773;00:48:55,252;00:48:57,553;other women.
774;00:48:57,587;00:48:59,421;Don't talk about my wife.
775;00:48:59,455;00:49:03,425;I'm not. I'm talking about
775;00:48:59,455;00:49:03,425;other women.
776;00:49:03,459;00:49:05,827;Like me, Ser Davos.

778;00:49:12,035;00:49:15,003;You want to see
778;00:49:12,035;00:49:15,003;what's beneath this robe.
779;00:49:16,606;00:49:18,807;And you will.
780;00:49:23,347;00:49:26,383;Strange that

781;00:49:26,417;00:49:29,286;asks you to work
781;00:49:26,417;00:49:29,286;in the shadows.
782;00:49:29,320;00:49:32,589;Shadows cannot live
782;00:49:29,320;00:49:32,589;in the dark, Ser Davos.

785;00:49:37,628;00:49:41,064;the darker they are.
786;00:49:41,098;00:49:43,933;These weren't here before.
786;00:49:41,098;00:49:43,933;They've barred the passage.
