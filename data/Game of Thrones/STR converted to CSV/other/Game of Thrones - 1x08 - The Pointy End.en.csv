337;00:28:21,118;00:28:26,658;It's an insult! Khaleesi will give me my prize
338;00:28:26,665;00:28:28,959;or I will take it with my arakh.
339;00:28:29,042;00:28:34,977;"She will speak before me; until then you will keep yourself quite."

346;00:28:58,947;00:29:00,449;...so they cannot be mounted.
347;00:29:04,244;00:29:06,038;This is the way of war.
348;00:29:06,163;00:29:08,081;These women are slaves now...
349;00:29:08,123;00:29:11,418;...to do with as we please.

351;00:29:14,922;00:29:19,167;lf your riders would mount them, let them take them for wives.
352;00:29:20,427;00:29:23,180;Does the horse mate with the lamb?
353;00:29:24,181;00:29:27,184;The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.

363;00:29:55,212;00:30:00,551;A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
364;00:30:00,717;00:30:03,345;Be still.
365;00:30:04,847;00:30:06,557;Don't move!

367;00:30:16,650;00:30:20,445;l will not give you that honour.
368;00:30:24,992;00:30:27,119;The beetles will feed on your eyes.
369;00:30:27,244;00:30:30,372;The worms will crawl through your lungs.
370;00:30:35,627;00:30:40,382;The rain will fall on your rotting skin...
371;00:30:41,884;00:30:46,054;...until nothing is left of you but bones!
372;00:30:49,141;00:30:50,517;First you have to kill me.

390;00:31:57,543;00:32:01,463;Too many words. A witch's words poison the ears.
393;00:32:09,596;00:32:12,266;Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars...
394;00:32:13,100;00:32:14,768;...it makes me hurt to see you bleed.
