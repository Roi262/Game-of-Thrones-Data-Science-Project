88;00:07:46,651;00:07:47,885;Brienne of Tarth
88;00:07:46,651;00:07:47,885;murdered Renly.
89;00:07:47,919;00:07:51,221;I don't believe that.
89;00:07:47,919;00:07:51,221;You don't believe that.
90;00:07:52,390;00:07:55,325;Who gained the most

92;00:07:57,361;00:07:59,261;I will put a sword

93;00:07:59,296;00:08:01,564;You can't stay here.
94;00:08:01,598;00:08:04,233;He would have been
94;00:08:01,598;00:08:04,233;a true king,
95;00:08:04,268;00:08:06,569;a good king.
96;00:08:06,604;00:08:08,438;Tell me, Ser Loras,

98;00:08:11,108;00:08:12,942;Revenge.
99;00:08:12,976;00:08:15,611;I have always found that to
99;00:08:12,976;00:08:15,611;be the purest of motivations,
100;00:08:15,645;00:08:19,181;but you won't have a chance to
100;00:08:15,645;00:08:19,181;put your sword through Stannis,
101;00:08:19,215;00:08:20,782;not today.
102;00:08:20,816;00:08:23,017;You'll be cut to pieces before
102;00:08:20,816;00:08:23,017;he sets foot on solid ground.
103;00:08:23,051;00:08:25,286;If it is justice
103;00:08:23,051;00:08:25,286;that you want,
104;00:08:25,320;00:08:26,753;be smart about it.
105;00:08:26,788;00:08:29,289;You can't avenge him
105;00:08:26,788;00:08:29,289;from the grave.
106;00:08:31,058;00:08:33,393;Bring the horses.
107;00:08:35,530;00:08:37,598;Please.
108;00:09:05,997;00:09:07,498;He was very handsome.
109;00:09:07,532;00:09:10,066;He was, Your Grace.
110;00:09:10,101;00:09:12,235;Your Grace.
111;00:09:13,871;00:09:16,172;Calling yourself king
111;00:09:13,871;00:09:16,172;doesn't make you one.
112;00:09:16,206;00:09:19,508;And if Renly wasn't a king,
112;00:09:16,206;00:09:19,508;I wasn't a queen.
113;00:09:21,044;00:09:22,944;Do you want to be a queen?
114;00:09:22,979;00:09:25,080;No.
115;00:09:26,282;00:09:28,916;I want to be the queen.
116;00:09:40,464;00:09:42,733;Killed?
116;00:09:40,464;00:09:42,733;By whom?
117;00:09:42,767;00:09:44,335;Accounts differ.
118;00:09:44,369;00:09:47,071;Most seem to implicate
118;00:09:44,369;00:09:47,071;Catelyn Stark in some way.
119;00:09:47,105;00:09:48,873;Really?
119;00:09:47,105;00:09:48,873;Who'd have thought?
120;00:09:48,907;00:09:51,074;Some say it was one
120;00:09:48,907;00:09:51,074;of his own Kingsguard,
121;00:09:51,109;00:09:54,010;while still others say it was
121;00:09:51,109;00:09:54,010;Stannis himself who did it
122;00:09:54,045;00:09:56,012;after negotiations
122;00:09:54,045;00:09:56,012;went sour.
123;00:09:56,046;00:09:58,080;Whomever did it,
123;00:09:56,046;00:09:58,080;I say well done.
124;00:09:58,115;00:09:59,548;It's not what Varys says.
125;00:09:59,583;00:10:02,218;He says Renly's army is
125;00:09:59,583;00:10:02,218;flocking to support Stannis,
126;00:10:02,252;00:10:06,188;which would give Stannis superiority
126;00:10:02,252;00:10:06,188;over us on both land and sea.
127;00:10:06,222;00:10:08,723;Littlefinger says we can
127;00:10:06,222;00:10:08,723;outspend him three to one.
128;00:10:08,758;00:10:11,593;And I say father raised you to
128;00:10:08,758;00:10:11,593;have too much respect for money.
129;00:10:11,627;00:10:13,995;Stannis Baratheon
129;00:10:11,627;00:10:13,995;is coming for us,
130;00:10:14,030;00:10:15,430;sooner rather than later.
131;00:10:15,464;00:10:16,832;Aren't there other things
131;00:10:15,464;00:10:16,832;you should be doing,
132;00:10:16,866;00:10:19,101;like sealing my daughter in a crate
132;00:10:16,866;00:10:19,101;so you can ship her away?
133;00:10:19,135;00:10:20,473;She'll be safer in Dorne.
134;00:10:20,498;00:10:22,205;Yes, I know how concerned
134;00:10:20,498;00:10:22,205;you are for her safety.
135;00:10:22,206;00:10:24,040;It so happens that I am.
136;00:10:24,074;00:10:25,809;Myrcella is a sweet,
136;00:10:24,074;00:10:25,809;innocent girl
137;00:10:25,843;00:10:27,744;and I don't blame her
137;00:10:25,843;00:10:27,744;at all for you.
138;00:10:27,778;00:10:30,380;So clever.
139;00:10:30,415;00:10:32,883;Aren't you
139;00:10:30,415;00:10:32,883;always so clever
140;00:10:32,917;00:10:35,185;with your schemes
140;00:10:32,917;00:10:35,185;and your plots?
141;00:10:36,354;00:10:38,254;Schemes and plots
141;00:10:36,354;00:10:38,254;are the same thing.
142;00:10:38,289;00:10:40,290;They are going
142;00:10:38,289;00:10:40,290;to attack us.
143;00:10:40,324;00:10:41,924;We need to be ready.
144;00:10:41,959;00:10:44,426;No need to concern
144;00:10:41,959;00:10:44,426;yourself over it.
145;00:10:44,461;00:10:47,796;The King is taking personal
145;00:10:44,461;00:10:47,796;charge of siege preparations.
146;00:10:47,831;00:10:51,466;May I ask specifically
146;00:10:47,831;00:10:51,466;what the King has in mind?
147;00:10:51,500;00:10:53,936;You may specifically
147;00:10:51,500;00:10:53,936;or you may ask vaguely.
148;00:10:53,970;00:10:56,204;The answer will be
148;00:10:53,970;00:10:56,204;the same.
149;00:11:00,710;00:11:04,680;It's important
149;00:11:00,710;00:11:04,680;that we talk about this.
150;00:11:06,984;00:11:09,586;It's the King's
150;00:11:06,984;00:11:09,586;royal prerogative
151;00:11:09,620;00:11:13,557;to withhold sensitive information
151;00:11:09,620;00:11:13,557;from his councilors.
152;00:11:22,100;00:11:24,235;It's wildfire.
153;00:11:24,303;00:11:26,004;Wildfire?
154;00:11:27,573;00:11:30,109;You wouldn't lie to me,
154;00:11:27,573;00:11:30,109;would you, cousin?
155;00:11:31,211;00:11:32,878;No.
155;00:11:31,211;00:11:32,878;That's a lie right there.
156;00:11:32,912;00:11:35,080;It is not a lie.
156;00:11:32,912;00:11:35,080;Why would I lie?
157;00:11:35,115;00:11:37,382;Tell me,
158;00:11:37,417;00:11:39,118;if the vile allegations
159;00:11:39,152;00:11:41,687;against my brother
159;00:11:39,152;00:11:41,687;and sister are true,
160;00:11:41,721;00:11:44,089;do you think it will
160;00:11:41,721;00:11:44,089;make Jaime more likely
161;00:11:44,123;00:11:46,458;to kill you or less likely?
162;00:11:46,493;00:11:49,179;When I tell him
162;00:11:46,493;00:11:49,179;you're fucking her, I mean.
163;00:11:49,204;00:11:50,962;I'm telling you the truth.
164;00:11:50,963;00:11:52,515;The smart money
164;00:11:50,963;00:11:52,515;would be on more likely.
165;00:11:52,540;00:11:54,098;She's making wildfire.
166;00:11:54,099;00:11:56,734;But then perhaps his own unnatural
166;00:11:54,099;00:11:56,734;urges will give him sympathy for yours.
167;00:11:56,768;00:11:58,202;The alchemists' guild
167;00:11:56,768;00:11:58,202;is being commissioned.
168;00:11:58,236;00:11:59,937;I suppose there's only
168;00:11:58,236;00:11:59,937;one way to find out.
169;00:11:59,971;00:12:02,572;They have thousands of pots
169;00:11:59,971;00:12:02,572;already stored in their vaults.
170;00:12:02,607;00:12:04,741;They are planning to launch
170;00:12:02,607;00:12:04,741;them from the city walls
171;00:12:04,775;00:12:06,576;into Stannis's ships
171;00:12:04,775;00:12:06,576;and armies.
172;00:12:06,610;00:12:09,245;Please.
173;00:12:09,279;00:12:12,147;When did she
173;00:12:09,279;00:12:12,147;tell you this?
174;00:12:13,417;00:12:15,652;I heard her talking
174;00:12:13,417;00:12:15,652;with the Pyromancer.
175;00:12:15,686;00:12:19,523;And the other night
175;00:12:15,686;00:12:19,523;after I left her,
176;00:12:19,557;00:12:21,826;she went to meet him.
177;00:12:21,860;00:12:24,796;I swear to you.
177;00:12:21,860;00:12:24,796;Swear to me on what?
178;00:12:24,830;00:12:27,566;On my life.
178;00:12:24,830;00:12:27,566;But I don't care about your life.
179;00:12:27,600;00:12:29,602;In the Light of the Seven,
180;00:12:29,636;00:12:31,637;by all that is
180;00:12:29,636;00:12:31,637;holy and right,
181;00:12:31,671;00:12:34,139;I, Lancel Lannister,
181;00:12:31,671;00:12:34,139;do solemnly vow--
182;00:12:34,173;00:12:35,569;All right, all right.
182;00:12:34,173;00:12:35,569;Enough.
183;00:12:35,594;00:12:37,594;Even torturing
183;00:12:35,594;00:12:37,594;you is boring.
184;00:12:37,943;00:12:40,545;Just get out.
185;00:12:43,581;00:12:45,148;Oh, Lancel,
185;00:12:43,581;00:12:45,148;tell my friend Bronn
186;00:12:45,183;00:12:48,185;to please kill you if anything
186;00:12:45,183;00:12:48,185;should happen to me.
187;00:12:48,219;00:12:51,287;Please kill me if anything
187;00:12:48,219;00:12:51,287;should happen to Lord Tyrion.
188;00:12:53,457;00:12:55,591;It will be my pleasure.
189;00:12:59,630;00:13:02,197;Your Grace.
189;00:12:59,630;00:13:02,197;What is it?
190;00:13:02,232;00:13:03,051;Your Grace.
191;00:13:03,076;00:13:05,033;I'm sorry about
191;00:13:03,076;00:13:05,033;your brother, Your Grace.
192;00:13:05,034;00:13:07,513;I wanted to let you know
192;00:13:05,034;00:13:07,513;that people grieve for him.
193;00:13:07,538;00:13:08,169;Your Grace.
194;00:13:08,170;00:13:09,971;Fools love a fool.
194;00:13:08,170;00:13:09,971;Your Grace.
195;00:13:10,006;00:13:12,641;I grieve for him as well--
195;00:13:10,006;00:13:12,641;for the boy he was,
196;00:13:12,676;00:13:14,310;not the man
196;00:13:12,676;00:13:14,310;he grew to be.
197;00:13:14,344;00:13:16,479;I need to speak to you about
197;00:13:14,344;00:13:16,479;what I saw in that cave.
198;00:13:16,513;00:13:18,075;I thought I made it clear
198;00:13:16,513;00:13:18,075;to you there'd be no need to
199;00:13:18,100;00:13:19,192;speak to me on this matter.
200;00:13:19,193;00:13:20,022;Your Grace, I--
201;00:13:20,047;00:13:22,047;I've never known you to
201;00:13:20,047;00:13:22,047;need to hear a thing twice.
202;00:13:24,455;00:13:26,256;And I've never known you
202;00:13:24,455;00:13:26,256;to hide from the truth.
203;00:13:26,291;00:13:27,792;You've come to lecture
203;00:13:26,291;00:13:27,792;me on truth?
204;00:13:27,826;00:13:29,527;I've come to tell you
204;00:13:27,826;00:13:29,527;that what I saw--
205;00:13:29,561;00:13:31,662;All my brother's bannermen
205;00:13:29,561;00:13:31,662;have come to my side.
206;00:13:33,532;00:13:36,733;Except the Tyrells,
206;00:13:33,532;00:13:36,733;who fled like cowards.
207;00:13:36,768;00:13:38,568;They won't be able
207;00:13:36,768;00:13:38,568;to resist us now.
208;00:13:38,602;00:13:40,470;Soon I shall be sitting
208;00:13:38,602;00:13:40,470;on the Iron Throne.
209;00:13:40,504;00:13:42,338;Nothing is worth
209;00:13:40,504;00:13:42,338;what this will cost you,
210;00:13:42,372;00:13:44,807;not even the Iron--
210;00:13:42,372;00:13:44,807;I'll hear no more about it.
211;00:13:51,715;00:13:55,118;Take a company of men,
211;00:13:51,715;00:13:55,118;secure the perimeter.
212;00:13:55,152;00:13:57,988;When do we sail
212;00:13:55,152;00:13:57,988;for King's Landing?
213;00:13:58,022;00:14:00,424;As soon as I've
213;00:13:58,022;00:14:00,424;consolidated my troops.
214;00:14:00,458;00:14:02,326;We'll make short work
214;00:14:00,458;00:14:02,326;of the Lannisters' fleet.
215;00:14:02,361;00:14:04,395;Once Blackwater Bay
215;00:14:02,361;00:14:04,395;is cleared,
216;00:14:04,430;00:14:07,532;we'll deliver our troops to their
216;00:14:04,430;00:14:07,532;doorstep and take the city.
217;00:14:09,001;00:14:11,269;And will you bring
217;00:14:09,001;00:14:11,269;Lady Melisandre with you?
218;00:14:12,271;00:14:14,372;That's not your concern.
219;00:14:14,406;00:14:17,875;If you take King's Landing with her
219;00:14:14,406;00:14:17,875;by your side, the victory will be hers.
220;00:14:17,909;00:14:20,277;I never thought I'd have reason to
220;00:14:17,909;00:14:20,277;doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?
221;00:14:20,311;00:14:23,213;Loyal service means
221;00:14:20,311;00:14:23,213;telling hard truths.
222;00:14:23,248;00:14:25,582;Oh, truth again.
223;00:14:25,616;00:14:28,718;All right,
223;00:14:25,616;00:14:28,718;what's the truth?
224;00:14:28,753;00:14:30,687;The hard truth?
225;00:14:30,721;00:14:32,656;She's a foreigner
226;00:14:32,690;00:14:34,791;preaching her
226;00:14:32,690;00:14:34,791;foreign religion.
227;00:14:34,825;00:14:39,062;Some believe she whispers orders
227;00:14:34,825;00:14:39,062;in your ear and you obey.
228;00:14:41,933;00:14:43,767;What do you believe?
229;00:14:47,339;00:14:50,842;You won those bannermen
229;00:14:47,339;00:14:50,842;from Renly.
230;00:14:50,877;00:14:52,944;Don't lose them to her.
231;00:14:57,883;00:15:00,718;We set out for King's Landing
231;00:14:57,883;00:15:00,718;without Lady Melisandre.
232;00:15:03,588;00:15:06,389;And you lead the fleet
232;00:15:03,588;00:15:06,389;into Blackwater Bay.
233;00:15:06,424;00:15:08,958;Your Grace, I'm honored,
233;00:15:06,424;00:15:08,958;but my time on the sea
234;00:15:08,992;00:15:11,627;was spent evading ships,
234;00:15:08,992;00:15:11,627;not attacking them.
235;00:15:11,661;00:15:13,428;The other lords
235;00:15:11,661;00:15:13,428;won't be happy.
236;00:15:13,463;00:15:16,498;Most of those lords should
236;00:15:13,463;00:15:16,498;consider themselves lucky
237;00:15:16,533;00:15:18,600;I don't hang them
237;00:15:16,533;00:15:18,600;for treason.
238;00:15:20,870;00:15:24,239;Hard truths cut
238;00:15:20,870;00:15:24,239;both ways, Ser Davos.
239;00:15:41,157;00:15:41,189;I've got it!
239;00:15:41,157;00:15:41,189;I've got it!
240;00:15:43,225;00:15:46,327;So it's that one there
240;00:15:43,225;00:15:46,327;at the top, on the right.
241;00:15:47,796;00:15:50,498;Buy my fruit, My Lord.
241;00:15:47,796;00:15:50,498;Fresh fruit.
242;00:15:50,532;00:15:52,333;Stannis has more infantry,
243;00:15:52,367;00:15:54,235;more ships, more horses.
244;00:15:54,270;00:15:55,971;What do we have?
245;00:15:56,005;00:15:58,540;There's that mind of yours
245;00:15:56,005;00:15:58,540;you keep going on about.
246;00:15:58,574;00:16:01,910;Well, I've never actually been
246;00:15:58,574;00:16:01,910;able to kill people with it.
247;00:16:01,944;00:16:04,813;Good thing.
247;00:16:01,944;00:16:04,813;I'd be out of a job.
248;00:16:04,848;00:16:07,082;What about your father?
249;00:16:07,116;00:16:10,452;He hasn't sent
249;00:16:07,116;00:16:10,452;a raven in weeks.
250;00:16:10,486;00:16:12,054;He's very busy.
251;00:16:12,088;00:16:15,957;Being repeatedly humiliated by
251;00:16:12,088;00:16:15,957;Robb Stark is time-consuming.
252;00:16:15,992;00:16:18,359;We won't be able to hold
252;00:16:15,992;00:16:18,359;the city against Stannis,
253;00:16:18,394;00:16:20,228;not the way Joffrey's
253;00:16:18,394;00:16:20,228;planning on holding it.
254;00:16:20,262;00:16:22,430;Corruption, yes.
255;00:16:22,464;00:16:27,367;We are swollen,
255;00:16:22,464;00:16:27,367;bloated, foul.
256;00:16:27,402;00:16:30,771;Brother fornicates with sister
256;00:16:27,402;00:16:30,771;in the bed of Kings
257;00:16:30,805;00:16:33,707;and we're surprised when the
257;00:16:30,805;00:16:33,707;fruit of their incest is rotten?
258;00:16:34,943;00:16:37,878;Yes, a rotten king.
259;00:16:37,912;00:16:40,414;It's hard to argue
259;00:16:37,912;00:16:40,414;with his assessment.
260;00:16:40,448;00:16:43,050;Not after what he did
260;00:16:40,448;00:16:43,050;to your birthday present.
261;00:16:43,084;00:16:45,786;The King is a lost cause.
262;00:16:45,820;00:16:48,055;It's the rest of us
262;00:16:45,820;00:16:48,055;I'm worried about now.
263;00:16:48,089;00:16:51,926;A dancing king, prancing
263;00:16:48,089;00:16:51,926;down his bloodstained halls
264;00:16:51,960;00:16:55,863;to the tune of a twisted
264;00:16:51,960;00:16:55,863;demon monkey.
265;00:16:57,032;00:16:59,934;You have to admire
265;00:16:57,032;00:16:59,934;his imagination.
266;00:16:59,968;00:17:03,337;He's talking about you.
266;00:16:59,968;00:17:03,337;What?
267;00:17:03,372;00:17:05,306;Demon monkey?
268;00:17:05,341;00:17:07,442;People think you're pulling
268;00:17:05,341;00:17:07,442;the King's strings.
269;00:17:07,476;00:17:09,678;They blame you
269;00:17:07,476;00:17:09,678;for the city's ills.
270;00:17:09,712;00:17:12,547;Blame me?
270;00:17:09,712;00:17:12,547;I'm trying to save them.
271;00:17:12,581;00:17:15,583;You don't need
271;00:17:12,581;00:17:15,583;to convince me.
272;00:17:15,618;00:17:18,186;Demon monkey.
273;00:17:18,220;00:17:20,388;( Seagulls screeching
274;00:17:47,284;00:17:48,884;Yeah, come on.
275;00:17:48,919;00:17:50,486;You're the crew
275;00:17:48,919;00:17:50,486;of the sea bitch?
276;00:17:50,520;00:17:54,256;I'm your commander.
276;00:17:50,520;00:17:54,256;Welcome.
277;00:17:56,426;00:17:57,893;Stop.
278;00:17:57,927;00:18:00,228;Stop!
279;00:18:00,263;00:18:03,431;Your Captain commands
279;00:18:00,263;00:18:03,431;you to stop.
280;00:18:03,466;00:18:06,468;Where are we
280;00:18:03,466;00:18:06,468;heading, Captain?
281;00:18:07,970;00:18:11,272;The Stony Shore
281;00:18:07,970;00:18:11,272;to raid their villages.
282;00:18:11,307;00:18:13,675;There'll be spoils
282;00:18:11,307;00:18:13,675;in it for you, and women,
283;00:18:13,709;00:18:15,244;if you do your jobs well.
284;00:18:15,278;00:18:18,548;And who decides if we've
284;00:18:15,278;00:18:18,548;done our jobs well?
285;00:18:19,917;00:18:22,018;I do.
286;00:18:22,053;00:18:24,087;Your Captain.
287;00:18:25,790;00:18:28,626;I have been reaving
287;00:18:25,790;00:18:28,626;and raping
288;00:18:28,660;00:18:32,697;since before you left
288;00:18:28,660;00:18:32,697;Balon's balls, Captain.
289;00:18:32,731;00:18:36,868;Don't reckon I've got much use
289;00:18:32,731;00:18:36,868;for your ideas on how to do it.
290;00:18:36,902;00:18:40,338;Don't reckon I've got
290;00:18:36,902;00:18:40,338;much use for a captain at all.
291;00:18:40,372;00:18:44,376;I'm thinking I can do the job
291;00:18:40,372;00:18:44,376;of captain real well myself.
292;00:18:44,410;00:18:46,511;All I need is a ship.
293;00:18:46,545;00:18:48,767;You wouldn't know
293;00:18:46,545;00:18:48,767;where I could find myself
294;00:18:48,792;00:18:50,792;a ship now, would you?
295;00:18:55,220;00:18:56,654;You could do that,
296;00:18:56,688;00:18:59,056;take the ship,
296;00:18:56,688;00:18:59,056;head out on your own.
297;00:18:59,090;00:19:01,530;And I will hunt you down,
297;00:18:59,090;00:19:01,530;drag you back here in chains,
298;00:19:01,555;00:19:03,093;and hang you for a traitor.
299;00:19:03,094;00:19:05,696;Stop. We yield.
300;00:19:08,433;00:19:11,902;Congratulations
300;00:19:08,433;00:19:11,902;on your first command.
301;00:19:11,937;00:19:14,672;Thank you. Kind of you
301;00:19:11,937;00:19:14,672;to come see me off.
302;00:19:14,706;00:19:16,173;Oh, I'm not here
302;00:19:14,706;00:19:16,173;for you.
303;00:19:16,208;00:19:19,209;I was just on my way
303;00:19:16,208;00:19:19,209;to Red Harbor.
304;00:19:19,244;00:19:23,014;I've got 30 ships. There's
304;00:19:19,244;00:19:23,014;nowhere to put them here.
305;00:19:23,048;00:19:26,316;Too narrow.
305;00:19:23,048;00:19:26,316;You'd better get out there.
306;00:19:26,351;00:19:28,385;Wouldn't want them
306;00:19:26,351;00:19:28,385;to set sail without you.
307;00:19:28,419;00:19:30,287;That would never happen.
308;00:19:30,322;00:19:34,324;My crew would wait on deck
308;00:19:30,322;00:19:34,324;for a year if I asked them to.
309;00:19:34,359;00:19:36,860;This lot, though...
310;00:19:38,363;00:19:41,098;Enjoy the Stony Shore.
311;00:19:45,470;00:19:48,071;Come on,
311;00:19:45,470;00:19:48,071;I'll take you out.
312;00:19:48,106;00:19:49,907;Who are you?
313;00:19:49,941;00:19:52,009;Dagmer, your first mate.
314;00:19:53,211;00:19:55,313;Why aren't you with
314;00:19:53,211;00:19:55,313;the rest of them?
315;00:19:55,347;00:19:59,417;Or did they send you to row me
315;00:19:55,347;00:19:59,417;out and dump me halfway in the sea?
316;00:19:59,451;00:20:00,852;That would be good
316;00:19:59,451;00:20:00,852;for a laugh.
317;00:20:00,886;00:20:03,755;They're not gonna respect you
317;00:20:00,886;00:20:03,755;until you prove yourself.
318;00:20:03,790;00:20:05,616;And how am I supposed
318;00:20:03,790;00:20:05,616;to prove myself by pillaging
319;00:20:05,641;00:20:07,226;piss-poor fishing villages?
320;00:20:07,227;00:20:09,294;You're not.
321;00:20:09,329;00:20:11,497;And yet that's the task
321;00:20:09,329;00:20:11,497;my father has given me
322;00:20:11,531;00:20:14,900;to prove that
322;00:20:11,531;00:20:14,900;I'm a true Iron Islander.
323;00:20:14,934;00:20:17,202;They're all Iron Islanders.
324;00:20:17,237;00:20:20,706;Do they do as they're told
324;00:20:17,237;00:20:20,706;or do they do as they like?
325;00:20:27,747;00:20:30,715;The Stony Shore's not far
325;00:20:27,747;00:20:30,715;from Torrhen's Square.
326;00:20:30,749;00:20:33,385;The seat of the House
326;00:20:30,749;00:20:33,385;of Tallhart--
327;00:20:33,419;00:20:36,321;a more impressive prize than
327;00:20:33,419;00:20:36,321;a few fishermen's daughters.
328;00:20:37,924;00:20:39,615;What, you don't think
328;00:20:37,924;00:20:39,615;we could take it?
329;00:20:39,640;00:20:40,793;No, we could.
330;00:20:40,794;00:20:42,996;We could never hold it
330;00:20:40,794;00:20:42,996;for more than a few days.
331;00:20:43,030;00:20:45,398;As soon as Winterfell got word that
331;00:20:43,030;00:20:45,398;we'd taken Torrhen's Square,
332;00:20:45,433;00:20:48,235;the Starks would send
332;00:20:45,433;00:20:48,235;their men to take it back.
333;00:20:49,771;00:20:52,406;And then--
334;00:20:57,345;00:20:59,780;take me to my ship.
335;00:21:03,918;00:21:06,920;The Starks have
335;00:21:03,918;00:21:06,920;overextended their lines.
336;00:21:06,955;00:21:09,022;Now that summer's over,
336;00:21:06,955;00:21:09,022;they'll have a hard time
337;00:21:09,057;00:21:11,124;keeping their men
337;00:21:09,057;00:21:11,124;and horses fed.
338;00:21:11,159;00:21:13,260;The Starks understand winter
338;00:21:11,159;00:21:13,260;better than we ever will.
339;00:21:13,295;00:21:14,996;The cold won't beat them.
340;00:21:15,030;00:21:19,634;Our spies report growing
340;00:21:15,030;00:21:19,634;discontent among the northern lords.
341;00:21:19,669;00:21:21,168;They want to return home
342;00:21:21,193;00:21:23,837;and gather the harvest
342;00:21:21,193;00:21:23,837;before the crops turn.
343;00:21:24,341;00:21:27,277;And I'm sure if those same spies
343;00:21:24,341;00:21:27,277;snuck into our own encampments,
344;00:21:27,311;00:21:30,481;they would report growing discontent
344;00:21:27,311;00:21:30,481;amongst the southern lords.
345;00:21:30,515;00:21:33,383;"This is war;"
345;00:21:30,515;00:21:33,383;No one's content.
346;00:21:35,120;00:21:38,355;We've underestimated
346;00:21:35,120;00:21:38,355;the Stark boy for too long.
347;00:21:38,390;00:21:41,725;He has a good mind for warfare,
347;00:21:38,390;00:21:41,725;his men worship him.
348;00:21:41,760;00:21:43,861;And as long as he keeps
348;00:21:41,760;00:21:43,861;winning battles,
349;00:21:43,895;00:21:47,798;they'll keep believing
349;00:21:43,895;00:21:47,798;he is King in the North.
350;00:21:47,832;00:21:49,467;You've been waiting
350;00:21:47,832;00:21:49,467;for him to fail.
351;00:21:49,501;00:21:52,036;He is not going to fail,
352;00:21:52,070;00:21:55,039;not without our help.
353;00:21:57,276;00:21:58,709;So how do we stop him?
354;00:21:58,744;00:22:01,112;We've worked through
354;00:21:58,744;00:22:01,112;the night, My Lord.
355;00:22:01,146;00:22:03,447;Perhaps we'd profit
355;00:22:01,146;00:22:03,447;from some sleep.
356;00:22:03,482;00:22:05,516;As I think
356;00:22:03,482;00:22:05,516;you would, Reginald.
357;00:22:05,551;00:22:07,118;And because
357;00:22:05,551;00:22:07,118;you're my cousin,
358;00:22:07,152;00:22:09,887;I might even let you
358;00:22:07,152;00:22:09,887;wake from that sleep.
359;00:22:11,123;00:22:13,458;Go, I'm sure your wife
359;00:22:11,123;00:22:13,458;must miss you.
360;00:22:13,492;00:22:15,226;My wife's in Lannisport.
361;00:22:15,260;00:22:17,462;Well, then you'd
361;00:22:15,260;00:22:17,462;better start riding.
362;00:22:18,897;00:22:22,501;Go before I change my mind
362;00:22:18,897;00:22:22,501;and send her your head.
363;00:22:22,535;00:22:24,903;If your name
363;00:22:22,535;00:22:24,903;wasn't Lannister,
364;00:22:24,938;00:22:28,507;you'd be scrubbing out pots
364;00:22:24,938;00:22:28,507;in the cook's tent. Go!
365;00:22:31,377;00:22:33,045;Not wine, water.
366;00:22:33,079;00:22:35,247;We'll be here
366;00:22:33,079;00:22:35,247;for some time.
367;00:22:40,153;00:22:42,888;Girl.
368;00:22:42,923;00:22:44,924;Where are you from?
369;00:22:44,958;00:22:46,826;Maidenpool, My Lord.
370;00:22:46,861;00:22:50,230;And who are the Lords
370;00:22:46,861;00:22:50,230;of Maidenpool?
371;00:22:50,264;00:22:54,134;Remind me.
371;00:22:50,264;00:22:54,134;House Mooton, My Lord.
372;00:22:54,169;00:22:56,203;And what is their Sigil?
373;00:23:00,509;00:23:02,143;A red salmon.
374;00:23:02,177;00:23:05,313;I think a Maidenpool girl
374;00:23:02,177;00:23:05,313;would remember that.
375;00:23:06,549;00:23:08,450;You're a northerner,
375;00:23:06,549;00:23:08,450;aren't you?
376;00:23:09,652;00:23:12,720;Good. One more time,
376;00:23:09,652;00:23:12,720;where are you from?
377;00:23:12,755;00:23:15,723;Barrowton, My Lord.
377;00:23:12,755;00:23:15,723;House Dustin.
378;00:23:15,758;00:23:19,828;Two crossed longaxes
378;00:23:15,758;00:23:19,828;beneath a black crown.
379;00:23:21,764;00:23:25,400;And what do they say
379;00:23:21,764;00:23:25,400;of Robb Stark in the North?
380;00:23:27,736;00:23:30,371;They call him
380;00:23:27,736;00:23:30,371;the young wolf.
381;00:23:30,406;00:23:32,841;And?
382;00:23:32,876;00:23:35,677;They say he rides into battle on
382;00:23:32,876;00:23:35,677;the back of a giant Direwolf.
383;00:23:37,981;00:23:41,984;They say he can turn into
383;00:23:37,981;00:23:41,984;a wolf himself when he wants.
384;00:23:42,019;00:23:43,987;They say he can't be killed.
385;00:23:45,289;00:23:46,924;And do you believe them?
386;00:23:48,026;00:23:50,828;No, My Lord.
387;00:23:50,863;00:23:52,997;Anyone can be killed.
388;00:24:00,239;00:24:02,340;Fetch that water.
389;00:24:42,915;00:24:45,484;A girl says nothing.
390;00:24:47,920;00:24:50,355;A girl keeps
390;00:24:47,920;00:24:50,355;her mouth closed.
391;00:24:50,389;00:24:53,025;No one hears,
392;00:24:53,059;00:24:56,929;and friends may talk
392;00:24:53,059;00:24:56,929;in secret, yes?
393;00:25:00,834;00:25:02,735;A boy becomes a girl.
394;00:25:02,770;00:25:04,371;I was always a girl.
395;00:25:04,405;00:25:06,607;And I was always aware.
396;00:25:06,641;00:25:09,343;But the girl
396;00:25:06,641;00:25:09,343;keeps secrets.
397;00:25:09,378;00:25:12,379;It is not for a man
397;00:25:09,378;00:25:12,379;to spoil them.
398;00:25:14,382;00:25:16,016;You're one of them now.
399;00:25:18,552;00:25:21,220;I should have let you burn.
400;00:25:23,289;00:25:25,790;And you fetch water
400;00:25:23,289;00:25:25,790;for one of them now.
401;00:25:25,825;00:25:29,860;Why is this right for you
401;00:25:25,825;00:25:29,860;and wrong for me?
402;00:25:29,895;00:25:31,596;I didn't have a choice.
403;00:25:31,630;00:25:35,700;You did.
403;00:25:31,630;00:25:35,700;I did.
404;00:25:35,735;00:25:37,369;And here we are.
405;00:25:40,573;00:25:42,407;A man pays his debts.
406;00:25:42,441;00:25:44,776;A man owes three.
407;00:25:44,810;00:25:46,077;Three what?
408;00:25:46,112;00:25:50,549;The Red God takes
408;00:25:46,112;00:25:50,549;what is his, lovely girl.
409;00:25:50,583;00:25:53,652;And only death
409;00:25:50,583;00:25:53,652;may pay for life.
410;00:25:54,788;00:25:57,289;You saved me
410;00:25:54,788;00:25:57,289;and the two I was with.
411;00:25:57,324;00:26:00,226;You stole three deaths
411;00:25:57,324;00:26:00,226;from the Red God.
412;00:26:03,797;00:26:05,965;We have to give them back.
413;00:26:08,869;00:26:11,303;Speak three names
414;00:26:11,337;00:26:13,906;and the man
414;00:26:11,337;00:26:13,906;will do the rest.
415;00:26:15,909;00:26:17,643;Three lives
415;00:26:15,909;00:26:17,643;I will give you--
416;00:26:17,677;00:26:21,013;no more, no less,
416;00:26:17,677;00:26:21,013;and we're done.
417;00:26:21,047;00:26:23,548;I can name anyone
418;00:26:23,583;00:26:25,884;and you'll kill him?
419;00:26:25,952;00:26:29,588;A man has said.
420;00:26:31,724;00:26:33,158;The one who
420;00:26:31,724;00:26:33,158;tortures everyone.
421;00:26:33,192;00:26:34,892;A man needs a name.
422;00:26:34,927;00:26:37,261;I don't know his name.
423;00:26:37,296;00:26:39,297;They call him
423;00:26:37,296;00:26:39,297;the Tickler.
424;00:26:39,331;00:26:41,498;That is enough.
425;00:26:41,533;00:26:45,635;Go now, girl.
425;00:26:41,533;00:26:45,635;Your master is thirsty.
426;00:26:58,983;00:27:00,416;He's not here yet.
427;00:27:00,451;00:27:02,886;He'd have seen us,
427;00:27:00,451;00:27:02,886;blown the horn.
428;00:27:02,920;00:27:05,088;When will he come?
429;00:27:05,123;00:27:07,124;The Halfhand does things
429;00:27:05,123;00:27:07,124;in his own time.
430;00:27:07,158;00:27:09,426;My uncle told me
430;00:27:07,158;00:27:09,426;stories about him.
431;00:27:09,461;00:27:11,495;Most of them are true.
432;00:27:11,530;00:27:14,198;I heard the Halfhand spent half
432;00:27:11,530;00:27:14,198;of last winter beyond the wall.
433;00:27:14,232;00:27:15,766;The whole winter.
434;00:27:15,800;00:27:18,468;He was north of the Skirling Pass
434;00:27:15,800;00:27:18,468;when the snows came.
435;00:27:18,503;00:27:20,170;Had to wait for the thaw.
436;00:27:20,204;00:27:24,173;So it is possible for someone
436;00:27:20,204;00:27:24,173;to survive out here on their own.
437;00:27:24,207;00:27:27,610;Well, possible
437;00:27:24,207;00:27:27,610;for the Halfhand.
438;00:27:27,644;00:27:29,445;Beautiful, isn't it?
439;00:27:29,480;00:27:32,013;Gilly would love it here.
440;00:27:32,048;00:27:35,650;There's nothing more sickening
440;00:27:32,048;00:27:35,650;than a man in love.
441;00:28:03,077;00:28:05,378;About time you did something.
442;00:28:05,412;00:28:08,180;At least you'll keep warm.
443;00:28:09,750;00:28:12,418;The fist
443;00:28:09,750;00:28:12,418;of the First Men.
444;00:28:12,453;00:28:15,956;Think of how old
444;00:28:12,453;00:28:15,956;this place is--
445;00:28:15,990;00:28:18,559;before the Targaryens
445;00:28:15,990;00:28:18,559;defeated the Hendals,
446;00:28:18,593;00:28:21,362;before the Andals took
446;00:28:18,593;00:28:21,362;Westeros from the First Men.
447;00:28:21,396;00:28:24,565;Before I die, please,
447;00:28:21,396;00:28:24,565;stop talking.
448;00:28:24,600;00:28:26,835;Thousands and thousands
448;00:28:24,600;00:28:26,835;of years ago,
449;00:28:26,869;00:28:29,939;the First Men stood here
449;00:28:26,869;00:28:29,939;where we're standing
450;00:28:29,973;00:28:32,274;all through the long night.
451;00:28:34,344;00:28:36,745;What do you think they
451;00:28:34,344;00:28:36,745;were like, the First Men?
452;00:28:36,780;00:28:38,380;Stupid.
453;00:28:38,414;00:28:41,584;Smart people don't find
453;00:28:38,414;00:28:41,584;themselves in places like this.
454;00:28:41,618;00:28:44,153;I think
454;00:28:41,618;00:28:44,153;they were afraid.
455;00:28:45,489;00:28:48,224;I think they came here
455;00:28:45,489;00:28:48,224;to get away from something.
456;00:28:48,258;00:28:51,794;And I don't think
456;00:28:48,258;00:28:51,794;it worked.
457;00:28:55,665;00:28:57,266;Wildlings?
458;00:28:59,636;00:29:02,004;One blast is for rangers returning.
459;00:29:02,039;00:29:03,706;Wildlings is two blasts.
460;00:29:03,740;00:29:07,209;So you got to stand
460;00:29:03,740;00:29:07,209;there waiting,
461;00:29:07,243;00:29:09,310;wondering.
462;00:29:09,345;00:29:10,979;One blast for friends,
463;00:29:11,014;00:29:13,916;two for foes.
464;00:29:14,918;00:29:21,257;And three
464;00:29:14,918;00:29:21,257;for White Walkers.
465;00:29:21,292;00:29:23,193;It's been 1,000 years,
466;00:29:23,227;00:29:25,963;but that's the only time
466;00:29:23,227;00:29:25,963;they blow the horn three times.
467;00:29:25,997;00:29:29,099;But if it's been 1,000 years,
467;00:29:25,997;00:29:29,099;how do you know?
468;00:29:29,133;00:29:32,835;Well...
468;00:29:29,133;00:29:32,835;I read it in a book.
469;00:29:32,870;00:29:34,971;Look.
470;00:29:36,139;00:29:38,273;It's Qhorin Halfhand.
471;00:29:38,308;00:29:41,510;Aye, we'll live
471;00:29:38,308;00:29:41,510;another day.
472;00:29:41,544;00:29:44,112;Hurrah.
473;00:29:53,455;00:29:56,324;Take care, My Lord.
474;00:29:56,358;00:29:59,327;I remember reading
474;00:29:56,358;00:29:59,327;an old sailor's proverb--
475;00:29:59,361;00:30:02,297;piss on wildfire
475;00:29:59,361;00:30:02,297;and your cock burns off.
476;00:30:02,332;00:30:05,968;Oh, I have not conducted
476;00:30:02,332;00:30:05,968;this experiment.
477;00:30:06,002;00:30:08,604;It could well be true.
478;00:30:08,639;00:30:10,473;The substance
478;00:30:08,639;00:30:10,473;burns so hot,
479;00:30:10,507;00:30:13,642;it melts wood,
479;00:30:10,507;00:30:13,642;stone, even steel,
480;00:30:13,677;00:30:16,979;and, of course, flesh.
481;00:30:17,013;00:30:21,516;The substance burns so hot,
481;00:30:17,013;00:30:21,516;it melts flesh like tallow.
482;00:30:24,853;00:30:28,189;After the dragons died,
482;00:30:24,853;00:30:28,189;wildfire was the key
483;00:30:28,223;00:30:29,991;to the Targaryen power.
484;00:30:30,025;00:30:33,061;My companion takes issue.
485;00:30:33,095;00:30:35,430;If I could tell you
485;00:30:33,095;00:30:35,430;how many crazy old men
486;00:30:35,464;00:30:37,599;I've seen pushing carts
486;00:30:35,464;00:30:37,599;around army camps
487;00:30:37,633;00:30:41,336;making grand claims about
487;00:30:37,633;00:30:41,336;jars full of pig shit...
488;00:30:41,371;00:30:44,606;No offense meant.
488;00:30:41,371;00:30:44,606;Our order does not deal in pig shit.
489;00:30:44,641;00:30:47,342;The substance
489;00:30:44,641;00:30:47,342;is fire given form.
490;00:30:47,376;00:30:50,945;And we have been perfecting it
490;00:30:47,376;00:30:50,945;since the days of Maegor.
491;00:30:50,980;00:30:52,313;To do what?
492;00:30:52,348;00:30:55,750;The jars are put in catapults
492;00:30:52,348;00:30:55,750;and flung at the enemy.
493;00:30:55,784;00:30:58,452;How much do you have?
494;00:31:01,289;00:31:05,124;If you could get real soldiers
494;00:31:01,289;00:31:05,124;to man the catapults,
495;00:31:05,158;00:31:08,526;then maybe you'd hit
495;00:31:05,158;00:31:08,526;your target one time in 10,
496;00:31:08,561;00:31:11,695;but all the real soldiers are in
496;00:31:08,561;00:31:11,695;the Riverlands with your father.
497;00:31:11,729;00:31:14,364;My Lord, this man
497;00:31:11,729;00:31:14,364;is insulting.
498;00:31:14,399;00:31:16,700;I don't know if you've
498;00:31:14,399;00:31:16,700;ever seen a battle, old man,
499;00:31:16,735;00:31:18,369;but things can get
499;00:31:16,735;00:31:18,369;a bit messy.
500;00:31:18,403;00:31:19,770;'Cause when we're flinging
500;00:31:18,403;00:31:19,770;things at Stannis,
501;00:31:19,804;00:31:21,572;he's flinging them
501;00:31:19,804;00:31:21,572;right back at us.
502;00:31:21,606;00:31:24,441;Men die, men shit
502;00:31:21,606;00:31:24,441;themselves, men run,
503;00:31:24,475;00:31:26,209;which means
503;00:31:24,475;00:31:26,209;pots falling,
504;00:31:26,244;00:31:28,144;which means fire
504;00:31:26,244;00:31:28,144;inside the walls,
505;00:31:28,179;00:31:30,445;which means the poor cunts
505;00:31:28,179;00:31:30,445;trying to defend the city
506;00:31:30,470;00:31:32,470;end up burning it down.
507;00:31:32,682;00:31:35,050;My friend remains
507;00:31:32,682;00:31:35,050;unconvinced.
508;00:31:35,084;00:31:37,419;He would not dare
508;00:31:35,084;00:31:37,419;insult my order
509;00:31:37,453;00:31:39,153;whilst Aerys Targaryen
509;00:31:37,453;00:31:39,153;lived.
510;00:31:39,188;00:31:41,789;Well, he's not
510;00:31:39,188;00:31:41,789;living anymore.
511;00:31:41,823;00:31:44,925;And all his pots of wildfire
511;00:31:41,823;00:31:44,925;didn't help him, did they?
512;00:31:44,960;00:31:48,929;Men win wars,
512;00:31:44,960;00:31:48,929;not magic tricks.
513;00:32:04,243;00:32:08,512;We have been working
513;00:32:04,243;00:32:08,512;tirelessly day and night
514;00:32:08,547;00:32:13,016;ever since your royal sister
514;00:32:08,547;00:32:13,016;commanded us to do so.
515;00:32:13,050;00:32:15,185;Our present count stands
516;00:32:15,219;00:32:18,721;at 7,811,
517;00:32:18,755;00:32:22,224;enough to burn Stannis
517;00:32:18,755;00:32:22,224;Baratheon's fleet
518;00:32:22,258;00:32:24,359;and armies both.
519;00:32:24,394;00:32:27,095;This is a shit idea.
520;00:32:27,129;00:32:30,998;I'm afraid I have to concur
520;00:32:27,129;00:32:30,998;with my advisor, wisdom Hallyne.
521;00:32:31,033;00:32:35,269;The contents of this room
521;00:32:31,033;00:32:35,269;could lay King's Landing low.
522;00:32:36,905;00:32:40,640;You won't be making wildfire
522;00:32:36,905;00:32:40,640;for my sister any longer.
523;00:32:42,243;00:32:44,878;You'll be making it
523;00:32:42,243;00:32:44,878;for me.
524;00:32:53,755;00:32:56,023;Dracarys.
525;00:33:03,565;00:33:06,000;Dracarys.
526;00:33:15,645;00:33:18,447;He'll be able to feed
526;00:33:15,645;00:33:18,447;himself from now on.
527;00:33:21,784;00:33:24,352;Let him sleep, Doreah.
528;00:33:24,387;00:33:27,156;Yes, Khaleesi.
529;00:33:29,359;00:33:31,327;He loves you.
530;00:33:42,206;00:33:44,408;Thank you, my friend.
531;00:33:45,810;00:33:49,580;Did you see the dress
531;00:33:45,810;00:33:49,580;Xaro had made for you?
532;00:33:49,614;00:33:52,649;They say he's the
532;00:33:49,614;00:33:52,649;wealthiest man in Qarth.
533;00:33:52,683;00:33:54,918;It is known.
534;00:33:54,953;00:33:57,955;And if Qarth is the wealthiest
534;00:33:54,953;00:33:57,955;city in Essos--
535;00:33:57,990;00:33:59,890;The last time a rich man
535;00:33:57,990;00:33:59,890;gave me a dress,
536;00:33:59,924;00:34:02,659;he was selling me
536;00:33:59,924;00:34:02,659;to Khal Drogo.
537;00:34:08,432;00:34:12,035;Xaro is our host,
537;00:34:08,432;00:34:12,035;but we know nothing about him.
538;00:34:12,069;00:34:14,838;Men like to talk
538;00:34:12,069;00:34:14,838;about other men
539;00:34:14,872;00:34:16,874;when they're happy.
540;00:34:24,416;00:34:26,517;You would look like
540;00:34:24,416;00:34:26,517;a real princess in Xaro's--
541;00:34:26,552;00:34:29,588;She's not a princess.
541;00:34:26,552;00:34:29,588;She's a Khaleesi.
542;00:34:35,561;00:34:37,862;You should wear it,
542;00:34:35,561;00:34:37,862;Khaleesi.
543;00:34:37,896;00:34:39,363;You are their guest.
544;00:34:39,397;00:34:41,999;It would be rude not to.
545;00:35:02,354;00:35:04,222;And you must visit
545;00:35:02,354;00:35:04,222;the night market.
546;00:35:04,256;00:35:09,094;The Qartheen night market is like
546;00:35:04,256;00:35:09,094;no night market you've ever seen.
547;00:35:09,129;00:35:10,997;It sounds wonderful.
548;00:35:11,031;00:35:12,999;The Meereens think
548;00:35:11,031;00:35:12,999;they have a night market.
549;00:35:13,034;00:35:15,301;I will take you
549;00:35:13,034;00:35:15,301;there myself.
550;00:35:15,335;00:35:18,771;Please excuse me
550;00:35:15,335;00:35:18,771;for a moment.
551;00:35:21,175;00:35:23,510;What are they doing?
552;00:35:23,544;00:35:27,280;Malakko says the statue
552;00:35:23,544;00:35:27,280;is too heavy to carry.
553;00:35:27,315;00:35:28,649;Kovarro says that
553;00:35:27,315;00:35:28,649;Malakko is an idiot.
554;00:35:28,683;00:35:31,385;They can pry out the gems,
554;00:35:28,683;00:35:31,385;the rest is pure gold.
555;00:35:31,419;00:35:35,022;Very soft. He can chop off
555;00:35:31,419;00:35:35,022;as much as we can carry.
556;00:36:02,685;00:36:05,553;My brother used to say the only
556;00:36:02,685;00:36:05,553;thing the Dothraki knew how to do
557;00:36:05,587;00:36:07,622;was steal things
557;00:36:05,587;00:36:07,622;better men have built.
558;00:36:07,656;00:36:09,357;It's not the only thing.
559;00:36:09,391;00:36:11,192;They're quite good
559;00:36:09,391;00:36:11,192;at killing the better men.
560;00:36:11,226;00:36:14,228;That's not the kind of queen
560;00:36:11,226;00:36:14,228;I'm going to be.
561;00:36:14,262;00:36:17,131;Mother of Dragons.
562;00:36:17,165;00:36:19,367;On behalf of the warlocks
562;00:36:17,165;00:36:19,367;of Qarth,
563;00:36:19,401;00:36:21,502;I welcome you.
564;00:36:22,737;00:36:24,738;A demonstration?
565;00:36:26,708;00:36:29,877;Take this gem.
565;00:36:26,708;00:36:29,877;Look at it.
566;00:36:31,246;00:36:33,647;Into its depths.
567;00:36:33,682;00:36:36,016;So many facets.
568;00:36:36,051;00:36:40,187;Look closely enough and you
568;00:36:36,051;00:36:40,187;can see yourself in them.
569;00:36:42,490;00:36:44,691;Often more than once.
570;00:36:47,862;00:36:51,564;Should you grow tired of
570;00:36:47,862;00:36:51,564;Xaro's baubles and trinkets,
571;00:36:51,598;00:36:54,934;it would be an honor to host you
571;00:36:51,598;00:36:54,934;at the House of the Undying.
572;00:36:54,968;00:36:57,403;You're always welcome,
573;00:36:57,437;00:37:00,106;Mother of Dragons.
574;00:37:06,647;00:37:08,982;My apologies.
575;00:37:09,016;00:37:11,584;Pyat Pree is one
575;00:37:09,016;00:37:11,584;of the Thirteen.
576;00:37:11,619;00:37:14,020;It was customary for me
576;00:37:11,619;00:37:14,020;to extend him an invitation.
577;00:37:14,054;00:37:17,189;Customs die
577;00:37:14,054;00:37:17,189;slow deaths in Qarth.
578;00:37:17,223;00:37:19,991;What is the House
578;00:37:17,223;00:37:19,991;of the Undying?
579;00:37:20,026;00:37:23,628;It is where the warlocks go
579;00:37:20,026;00:37:23,628;to squint at dusty books
580;00:37:23,662;00:37:25,229;and drink shade
580;00:37:23,662;00:37:25,229;of the evening.
581;00:37:25,264;00:37:29,333;It turns their lips blue
581;00:37:25,264;00:37:29,333;and their minds soft--
582;00:37:29,367;00:37:32,235;so soft,
582;00:37:29,367;00:37:32,235;they actually believe
583;00:37:32,269;00:37:34,270;their parlor tricks
583;00:37:32,269;00:37:34,270;are magic.
584;00:37:37,942;00:37:40,577;You watch over her.
585;00:37:42,280;00:37:44,148;Do I know you?
586;00:37:44,182;00:37:46,084;I know you.
587;00:37:46,118;00:37:49,654;Jorah Mormont
587;00:37:46,118;00:37:49,654;of Bear Island.
588;00:37:49,688;00:37:51,423;Who are you?
589;00:37:51,457;00:37:53,759;I'm no one.
590;00:37:53,793;00:37:55,761;But she is
590;00:37:53,793;00:37:55,761;the Mother of Dragons.
591;00:37:55,795;00:37:59,398;She needs true protectors
591;00:37:55,795;00:37:59,398;now more than ever.
592;00:37:59,432;00:38:01,400;They shall come
592;00:37:59,432;00:38:01,400;day and night
593;00:38:01,434;00:38:03,936;to see the wonder born
593;00:38:01,434;00:38:03,936;into the world again.
594;00:38:03,971;00:38:07,474;And when they see,
594;00:38:03,971;00:38:07,474;they shall lust,
595;00:38:07,508;00:38:11,311;for dragons are fire
595;00:38:07,508;00:38:11,311;made flesh.
596;00:38:11,346;00:38:13,947;And fire is power.
597;00:38:24,258;00:38:26,526;It looked like Stannis.
598;00:38:26,560;00:38:29,995;To me it just
598;00:38:26,560;00:38:29,995;looked like...
599;00:38:33,434;00:38:36,102;A shadow in
599;00:38:33,434;00:38:36,102;the shape of a man.
600;00:38:36,136;00:38:38,171;In the shape
600;00:38:36,136;00:38:38,171;of Stannis.
601;00:38:42,544;00:38:45,246;We should reach
601;00:38:42,544;00:38:45,246;my son's camp tomorrow.
602;00:38:45,280;00:38:47,381;Will you stay there
602;00:38:45,280;00:38:47,381;long, My Lady?
603;00:38:47,416;00:38:51,085;Only long enough to tell
603;00:38:47,416;00:38:51,085;Robb what I have seen.
604;00:38:51,120;00:38:54,422;After that, I will leave
604;00:38:51,120;00:38:54,422;for Winterfell.
605;00:38:55,590;00:38:57,758;My two youngest need me.
606;00:38:57,792;00:39:00,927;I've been away from them
606;00:38:57,792;00:39:00,927;for far too long.
607;00:39:00,961;00:39:03,863;I never knew my mother.
608;00:39:04,898;00:39:06,398;I'm sorry.
609;00:39:06,433;00:39:10,135;My own mother died
609;00:39:06,433;00:39:10,135;on the birthing bed
610;00:39:10,169;00:39:13,004;when I was very young.
611;00:39:16,242;00:39:18,777;It's a bloody business.
612;00:39:18,811;00:39:22,347;What comes after
612;00:39:18,811;00:39:22,347;is even harder.
613;00:39:24,016;00:39:27,152;Once you're safely back
613;00:39:24,016;00:39:27,152;amongst your own people,
614;00:39:27,186;00:39:30,322;will you give me leave
614;00:39:27,186;00:39:30,322;to go, My Lady?
615;00:39:30,356;00:39:32,558;You mean to kill Stannis.
616;00:39:32,592;00:39:34,226;I swore a vow.
617;00:39:34,260;00:39:37,529;But Stannis has
617;00:39:34,260;00:39:37,529;a great army around him.
618;00:39:37,563;00:39:40,065;His own guards are sworn
618;00:39:37,563;00:39:40,065;to keep him safe.
619;00:39:40,099;00:39:41,966;I'm as good
619;00:39:40,099;00:39:41,966;as any of them.
620;00:39:43,436;00:39:44,869;I should never have fled.
621;00:39:44,904;00:39:48,639;Renly's death
621;00:39:44,904;00:39:48,639;was no fault of yours.
622;00:39:48,673;00:39:50,507;You served him bravely.
623;00:39:50,542;00:39:54,546;I only held him
623;00:39:50,542;00:39:54,546;that once
624;00:39:54,580;00:39:57,215;as he was dying.
625;00:39:59,685;00:40:01,319;He's gone, Brienne.
626;00:40:01,354;00:40:05,958;You serve nothing and no one
626;00:40:01,354;00:40:05,958;by following him into the earth.
627;00:40:07,227;00:40:10,330;Renly's enemies are
627;00:40:07,227;00:40:10,330;Robb's enemies as well.
628;00:40:14,969;00:40:17,003;I do not know
628;00:40:14,969;00:40:17,003;your son, My Lady...
629;00:40:19,206;00:40:23,175;but I could serve you
629;00:40:19,206;00:40:23,175;if you would have me.
630;00:40:23,209;00:40:25,277;You have courage.
631;00:40:25,311;00:40:27,779;Not battle courage, perhaps,
632;00:40:27,813;00:40:31,249;but, I don't know,
633;00:40:31,284;00:40:33,184;a woman's kind of courage.
634;00:40:33,219;00:40:35,721;And I think that
634;00:40:33,219;00:40:35,721;when the time comes,
635;00:40:35,755;00:40:37,222;you will not hold me back.
636;00:40:37,257;00:40:39,959;Promise me that you
636;00:40:37,257;00:40:39,959;will not hold me back
637;00:40:39,993;00:40:42,328;from Stannis.
638;00:40:46,900;00:40:50,203;When the time comes,
638;00:40:46,900;00:40:50,203;I will not hold you back.
639;00:40:56,811;00:40:59,145;Then I am yours,
639;00:40:56,811;00:40:59,145;My Lady.
640;00:41:00,247;00:41:01,748;I will shield your back
641;00:41:01,782;00:41:04,851;and give my life for yours
641;00:41:01,782;00:41:04,851;if it comes to that.
642;00:41:04,885;00:41:08,487;I swear it by the Old Gods
642;00:41:04,885;00:41:08,487;and the new.
643;00:41:15,429;00:41:18,999;I vow that you shall always
643;00:41:15,429;00:41:18,999;have a place in my home
644;00:41:19,034;00:41:21,001;and at my table
645;00:41:21,035;00:41:23,470;and that I shall ask
645;00:41:21,035;00:41:23,470;no service of you
646;00:41:23,505;00:41:26,073;that might
646;00:41:23,505;00:41:26,073;bring you dishonor.
647;00:41:26,107;00:41:29,176;I swear it by the Old Gods
647;00:41:26,107;00:41:29,176;and the new.
648;00:41:32,447;00:41:34,647;And it's not
648;00:41:32,447;00:41:34,647;just thieves, My Lord.
649;00:41:34,983;00:41:37,852;There's wolves
649;00:41:34,983;00:41:37,852;in them hills now,
650;00:41:37,886;00:41:40,187;more than I've ever seen.
651;00:41:40,222;00:41:43,258;They come down in the night
651;00:41:40,222;00:41:43,258;and they kill my sheep.
652;00:41:43,292;00:41:47,128;My three sons is away fighting
652;00:41:43,292;00:41:47,128;for your brother, My Lord.
653;00:41:47,162;00:41:49,363;They'll fight,
653;00:41:47,162;00:41:49,363;keep fighting
654;00:41:49,397;00:41:51,532;till they're told
654;00:41:49,397;00:41:51,532;to go home.
655;00:41:51,566;00:41:54,168;I have no one to man
655;00:41:51,566;00:41:54,168;my flock now. Only me.
656;00:41:54,202;00:41:57,837;I can't keep watch
656;00:41:54,202;00:41:57,837;all day and all night.
657;00:41:59,874;00:42:02,675;We can send two orphan boys
657;00:41:59,874;00:42:02,675;from Winterstown home with you
658;00:42:02,710;00:42:04,443;to help watch over
658;00:42:02,710;00:42:04,443;your flock
659;00:42:04,478;00:42:06,278;if you can give them
659;00:42:04,478;00:42:06,278;room and board.
660;00:42:06,313;00:42:09,014;My wife always prayed
660;00:42:06,313;00:42:09,014;for more children.
661;00:42:09,048;00:42:11,416;We'll look after them.
661;00:42:09,048;00:42:11,416;Thank you, My Lord.
662;00:42:11,450;00:42:14,787;And may the Gods
662;00:42:11,450;00:42:14,787;bless you and yours.
663;00:42:17,658;00:42:19,793;Stop it.
664;00:42:19,827;00:42:23,130;If that's everyone, I'm going
664;00:42:19,827;00:42:23,130;to go for a ride before dark.
665;00:42:23,164;00:42:25,166;Good.
665;00:42:23,164;00:42:25,166;Hodor.
666;00:42:25,200;00:42:29,137;Hodor.
666;00:42:25,200;00:42:29,137;Bran-- Lord Stark.
667;00:42:29,172;00:42:30,906;Torrhen's Square
667;00:42:29,172;00:42:30,906;is under siege.
668;00:42:30,940;00:42:33,608;Torrhen's Square is barely
668;00:42:30,940;00:42:33,608;40 leagues from here.
669;00:42:33,642;00:42:36,711;How can the Lannisters
669;00:42:33,642;00:42:36,711;strike so far north?
670;00:42:36,746;00:42:39,347;Might be a raiding party
670;00:42:36,746;00:42:39,347;led by the Mountain.
671;00:42:39,381;00:42:41,882;Might be Sellswords
671;00:42:39,381;00:42:41,882;paid by Tywin Lannister.
672;00:42:41,917;00:42:43,150;We have to help them.
673;00:42:43,185;00:42:44,685;Most of the fighting men
673;00:42:43,185;00:42:44,685;are away with Robb,
674;00:42:44,720;00:42:46,420;but I can gather
674;00:42:44,720;00:42:46,420;200 decent men.
675;00:42:46,454;00:42:47,681;Do you need so many?
676;00:42:47,706;00:42:49,223;If we can't protect
676;00:42:47,706;00:42:49,223;our own bannermen,
677;00:42:49,224;00:42:52,026;why should
677;00:42:49,224;00:42:52,026;they protect us?
678;00:42:52,060;00:42:54,829;Go, Ser Rodrik.
678;00:42:52,060;00:42:54,829;Take the men you need.
679;00:42:54,864;00:42:56,331;Won't take long, My Lord.
680;00:42:56,365;00:42:58,166;Southerners don't
680;00:42:56,365;00:42:58,166;do well up here.
681;00:43:08,579;00:43:11,114;So, what does it mean?
682;00:43:11,148;00:43:12,190;Ask your Maester Luwin.
683;00:43:12,215;00:43:14,369;He's the one studying
683;00:43:12,215;00:43:14,369;books all the time.
684;00:43:14,518;00:43:17,854;I did ask him. He'd never
684;00:43:14,518;00:43:17,854;heard of a three-eyed raven.
685;00:43:17,888;00:43:21,491;Must not mean anything, then
685;00:43:17,888;00:43:21,491;You're lying.
686;00:43:21,525;00:43:24,293;You might be a little lord,
686;00:43:21,525;00:43:24,293;but don't you call me a liar.
687;00:43:24,327;00:43:27,563;You know what it means.
687;00:43:24,327;00:43:27,563;I never said I didn't.
688;00:43:27,597;00:43:29,531;You didn't give me
688;00:43:27,597;00:43:29,531;an honest answer.
689;00:43:29,566;00:43:32,568;That's not the same
689;00:43:29,566;00:43:32,568;as being a liar.
690;00:43:32,602;00:43:34,203;Well, it's not far off.
691;00:43:34,237;00:43:38,341;So, you've been dreaming
691;00:43:34,237;00:43:38,341;of a three-eyed raven again?
692;00:43:39,777;00:43:43,079;In the Godswood,
692;00:43:39,777;00:43:43,079;you told me you didn't dream.
693;00:43:43,114;00:43:45,148;Now who's a liar?
694;00:43:48,919;00:43:50,954;What did you see
694;00:43:48,919;00:43:50,954;in your dream?
695;00:43:53,391;00:43:55,659;Something bad?
696;00:43:55,693;00:43:57,894;Tell me, boy.
697;00:44:01,232;00:44:04,167;I dreamt that the sea
697;00:44:01,232;00:44:04,167;came to Winterfell.
698;00:44:05,603;00:44:08,070;I saw waves crashing
698;00:44:05,603;00:44:08,070;against the gates
699;00:44:08,105;00:44:11,807;and the water came
699;00:44:08,105;00:44:11,807;flowing over the walls...
700;00:44:14,144;00:44:16,646;flooded the castle.
701;00:44:18,849;00:44:21,050;Drowned men
701;00:44:18,849;00:44:21,050;were floating here
702;00:44:21,084;00:44:23,219;in the yard.
703;00:44:25,789;00:44:28,825;Ser Rodrik
703;00:44:25,789;00:44:28,825;was one of them.
704;00:44:30,861;00:44:33,563;The sea is hundreds
704;00:44:30,861;00:44:33,563;of miles away.
705;00:44:33,598;00:44:35,212;I know.
706;00:44:35,213;00:44:36,538;It's just a stupid dream.
707;00:44:36,563;00:44:38,434;I've got to get these
707;00:44:36,563;00:44:38,434;potatoes to the kitchen.
708;00:44:38,435;00:44:39,936;Otherwise they'll put me
708;00:44:38,435;00:44:39,936;in chains again.
709;00:44:39,971;00:44:42,372;Osha.
710;00:44:42,406;00:44:44,875;The three-eyed raven,
711;00:44:44,909;00:44:47,378;what do they say about it
712;00:44:47,413;00:44:50,214;north of the wall?
713;00:44:50,249;00:44:53,551;They say all sorts of crazy
713;00:44:50,249;00:44:53,551;things north of the wall.
714;00:45:04,697;00:45:07,098;There.
714;00:45:04,697;00:45:07,098;- Where?
715;00:45:07,132;00:45:08,899;On that Mountain.
716;00:45:08,933;00:45:11,401;I don't see very well.
717;00:45:11,436;00:45:13,036;A fire.
718;00:45:15,307;00:45:18,309;There's a fire.
719;00:45:18,343;00:45:21,479;The people sitting around it have
719;00:45:18,343;00:45:21,479;better eyes than yours or mine.
720;00:45:21,513;00:45:24,582;When they see us coming,
720;00:45:21,513;00:45:24,582;that fire becomes a signal.
721;00:45:24,616;00:45:28,186;Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time.
721;00:45:24,616;00:45:28,186;to throw a party in our honor.
722;00:45:28,221;00:45:30,289;How many wildlings
722;00:45:28,221;00:45:30,289;have joined him?
723;00:45:30,323;00:45:34,492;From what we can tell,
723;00:45:30,323;00:45:34,492;all of them.
724;00:45:39,064;00:45:41,499;Mance has gathered them all
724;00:45:39,064;00:45:41,499;like deer against the wolves.
725;00:45:41,534;00:45:43,535;They're almost ready
725;00:45:41,534;00:45:43,535;to make their move.
726;00:45:43,569;00:45:45,503;Where?
727;00:45:45,537;00:45:47,372;Somewhere safe.
728;00:45:47,406;00:45:49,240;Somewhere south.
729;00:45:49,274;00:45:52,209;Can't just march
729;00:45:49,274;00:45:52,209;into their midst.
730;00:45:52,243;00:45:54,030;And we can't wait for them
730;00:45:52,243;00:45:54,030;here with nothing but a pile
731;00:45:54,055;00:45:55,880;of stones to protect us.
732;00:45:55,881;00:45:58,817;You saying we should
732;00:45:55,881;00:45:58,817;fall back to the Wall?
733;00:45:58,851;00:46:02,254;Mance was one of us once.
734;00:46:02,289;00:46:04,690;Now he's one of them.
735;00:46:04,725;00:46:07,460;He's gonna teach them
735;00:46:04,725;00:46:07,460;our way of doing things.
736;00:46:07,495;00:46:09,396;They'll hit us in force.
737;00:46:09,430;00:46:11,833;And they won't run away
737;00:46:09,430;00:46:11,833;when we hit back.
738;00:46:11,867;00:46:14,302;They're gonna be more
738;00:46:11,867;00:46:14,302;organized than before,
739;00:46:14,336;00:46:16,237;more disciplined
740;00:46:16,271;00:46:18,306;more like us.
741;00:46:18,340;00:46:20,942;So we need to be
741;00:46:18,340;00:46:20,942;more like them,
742;00:46:20,976;00:46:22,877;do things their way.
743;00:46:22,911;00:46:26,080;Sneak in, kill Mance,
744;00:46:26,114;00:46:27,715;and scatter them
744;00:46:26,114;00:46:27,715;to the winds
745;00:46:27,749;00:46:29,783;before they can march
745;00:46:27,749;00:46:29,783;on the Wall.
746;00:46:29,817;00:46:30,664;And to do that...
747;00:46:30,689;00:46:32,681;We need to get rid
747;00:46:30,689;00:46:32,681;of those lookouts.
748;00:46:32,854;00:46:34,655;It's not a job
748;00:46:32,854;00:46:34,655;for 400 men.
749;00:46:34,689;00:46:38,392;I need to move fast
749;00:46:34,689;00:46:38,392;and silent.
750;00:46:38,426;00:46:42,129;Harker, Stonesnake,
750;00:46:38,426;00:46:42,129;Borba.
751;00:46:43,365;00:46:45,566;Lord Commander, I'd like
751;00:46:43,365;00:46:45,566;to join Lord Qhorin.
752;00:46:45,600;00:46:48,202;I've been called
752;00:46:45,600;00:46:48,202;lots of things,
753;00:46:48,236;00:46:50,124;but that might be
753;00:46:48,236;00:46:50,124;my first Lord Qhorin.
754;00:46:50,605;00:46:53,474;You're a steward,
754;00:46:50,605;00:46:53,474;Snow, not a ranger.
755;00:46:53,509;00:46:55,743;I've fought
755;00:46:53,509;00:46:55,743;and killed a Wight.
756;00:46:55,778;00:46:57,979;How many rangers
756;00:46:55,778;00:46:57,979;can say that?
757;00:46:58,014;00:47:00,048;He's the one?
758;00:47:01,150;00:47:03,551;Aye.
758;00:47:01,150;00:47:03,551;You killed a Wight.
759;00:47:03,586;00:47:05,453;You also let an old man
760;00:47:05,488;00:47:08,323;beat you bloody
760;00:47:05,488;00:47:08,323;and take your sword.
761;00:47:08,357;00:47:10,692;Craster?
762;00:47:10,726;00:47:13,728;In the boy's defense,
762;00:47:10,726;00:47:13,728;that's a tough old goat.
763;00:47:16,665;00:47:19,467;I could take up Jon's duties
763;00:47:16,665;00:47:19,467;while he's gone, My Lord.
764;00:47:19,501;00:47:22,136;It would be no trouble.
765;00:47:30,178;00:47:33,581;Well, I hope you make
765;00:47:30,178;00:47:33,581;a better ranger
766;00:47:33,615;00:47:35,950;than you do a steward.
767;00:47:37,653;00:47:39,353;Go on.
768;00:47:46,529;00:47:48,364;So, tell me,
769;00:47:48,398;00:47:51,501;how long has your manservant
769;00:47:48,398;00:47:51,501;been in love with you?
770;00:47:51,535;00:47:55,238;He's not my manservant
770;00:47:51,535;00:47:55,238;and he's not in love with me.
771;00:47:55,272;00:47:57,340;He's my advisor,
772;00:47:57,375;00:47:59,342;my friend.
773;00:47:59,377;00:48:00,911;Unlikely.
774;00:48:00,945;00:48:03,681;I can almost always tell
774;00:48:00,945;00:48:03,681;what a man wants.
775;00:48:03,715;00:48:06,050;And what about
775;00:48:03,715;00:48:06,050;what a woman wants?
776;00:48:06,084;00:48:08,152;Much more complicated.
777;00:48:08,187;00:48:10,221;You, for example,
778;00:48:10,255;00:48:12,824;what do you want?
779;00:48:12,858;00:48:15,894;To cross the Narrow Sea
779;00:48:12,858;00:48:15,894;and take back the Iron Throne.
780;00:48:15,928;00:48:17,462;Why?
781;00:48:17,497;00:48:19,231;Because I promised
781;00:48:17,497;00:48:19,231;my Khalasar I'd protect them
782;00:48:19,265;00:48:21,667;and find them a safe home.
783;00:48:21,701;00:48:25,305;You want to conquer
783;00:48:21,701;00:48:25,305;the Seven Kingdoms?
784;00:48:25,339;00:48:27,007;I want them because
784;00:48:25,339;00:48:27,007;they're mine by right.
785;00:48:27,041;00:48:30,110;The Iron Throne is mine
785;00:48:27,041;00:48:30,110;and I will take it.
786;00:48:30,145;00:48:31,945;Ah, a conqueror.
787;00:48:31,980;00:48:34,114;And how did you get
787;00:48:31,980;00:48:34,114;all of this?
788;00:48:34,148;00:48:36,183;Did someone give it to you?
788;00:48:34,148;00:48:36,183;No.
789;00:48:36,217;00:48:37,717;I come from nothing.
790;00:48:37,752;00:48:39,919;I hit the docks
790;00:48:37,752;00:48:39,919;like a piece of cargo,
791;00:48:39,954;00:48:42,555;except someone normally
791;00:48:39,954;00:48:42,555;cares what happens to cargo.
792;00:48:42,557;00:48:45,291;So you wanted more than
792;00:48:42,557;00:48:45,291;you had and you took it.
793;00:48:45,325;00:48:49,261;You're a conqueror, too.
793;00:48:45,325;00:48:49,261;you're just less ambitious.
794;00:48:50,997;00:48:53,466;Mmm.
795;00:48:53,500;00:48:56,636;What do you want,
795;00:48:53,500;00:48:56,636;Xaro Zhoan Daxos?
796;00:48:56,670;00:48:59,372;At the gates of the city,
796;00:48:56,670;00:48:59,372;you bled for me.
797;00:48:59,406;00:49:02,409;Why?
798;00:49:02,443;00:49:04,778;I will show you why.
799;00:49:08,136;00:49:11,339;The door and the vault
799;00:49:08,136;00:49:11,339;is made of Valyrian stone.
800;00:49:11,520;00:49:15,323;The hardest steel
800;00:49:11,520;00:49:15,323;does not make a mark.
801;00:49:15,357;00:49:18,726;I offered the greatest
801;00:49:15,357;00:49:18,726;locksmiths in Qarth
802;00:49:18,760;00:49:21,095;their weight in gold
802;00:49:18,760;00:49:21,095;if they could break into it.
803;00:49:21,129;00:49:23,697;I made the same offer
803;00:49:21,129;00:49:23,697;to the greatest thieves.
804;00:49:23,731;00:49:26,433;They all went home
804;00:49:23,731;00:49:26,433;empty-handed.
805;00:49:26,467;00:49:29,736;The only thing that
805;00:49:26,467;00:49:29,736;can open this door
806;00:49:29,770;00:49:31,904;is this key.
807;00:49:31,939;00:49:33,373;And behind the door?
808;00:49:36,711;00:49:38,879;And it can all be mine?
809;00:49:38,914;00:49:40,581;All?
810;00:49:40,616;00:49:44,085;Let us say half.
811;00:49:44,120;00:49:48,357;More than enough to buy
811;00:49:44,120;00:49:48,357;horses, ships, armies--
812;00:49:48,392;00:49:50,493;enough to go home.
813;00:49:50,527;00:49:53,430;All I have to do?
814;00:49:53,464;00:49:54,798;Is marry me.
815;00:49:54,832;00:49:57,934;That was a romantic proposal.
816;00:49:57,968;00:50:00,303;I've already married
816;00:49:57,968;00:50:00,303;once for love,
817;00:50:00,338;00:50:03,073;but the Gods
817;00:50:00,338;00:50:03,073;stole her from me.
818;00:50:05,410;00:50:07,311;I come from nothing.
819;00:50:07,345;00:50:10,213;My mother and father
819;00:50:07,345;00:50:10,213;never owned a pair of shoes.
820;00:50:10,247;00:50:13,383;But marry me and I will
820;00:50:10,247;00:50:13,383;give you the Seven Kingdoms
821;00:50:13,417;00:50:17,154;and our children will be
821;00:50:13,417;00:50:17,154;Princes and Princesses.
822;00:50:19,390;00:50:21,424;See?
823;00:50:21,458;00:50:24,094;I have more ambition
823;00:50:21,458;00:50:24,094;than you thought.
824;00:50:25,563;00:50:27,672;The time is right,
824;00:50:25,563;00:50:27,672;Daenerys Targaryen,
825;00:50:27,697;00:50:29,697;first of your name.
826;00:50:30,068;00:50:32,537;Robert Baratheon
826;00:50:30,068;00:50:32,537;is dead.
827;00:50:39,378;00:50:41,713;If you cross the sea
827;00:50:39,378;00:50:41,713;with an army you bought--
828;00:50:41,748;00:50:44,016;The Seven Kingdoms are
828;00:50:41,748;00:50:44,016;at war with one another.
829;00:50:44,051;00:50:46,452;Four false kings
829;00:50:44,051;00:50:46,452;destroying the country.
830;00:50:46,487;00:50:49,789;To win Westeros, you need
830;00:50:46,487;00:50:49,789;support from Westeros.
831;00:50:49,824;00:50:51,624;The usurper is dead.
832;00:50:51,659;00:50:53,326;The Starks fight
832;00:50:51,659;00:50:53,326;the Lannisters,
833;00:50:53,360;00:50:55,261;and Baratheons
833;00:50:53,360;00:50:55,261;fight each other.
834;00:50:55,295;00:50:56,829;According to
834;00:50:55,295;00:50:56,829;your new friend
835;00:50:56,863;00:50:58,597;who earned your trust
835;00:50:56,863;00:50:58,597;by cutting his hand?
836;00:50:58,631;00:51:01,500;The time to strike is now. We need
836;00:50:58,631;00:51:01,500;to find ships and an army
837;00:51:01,534;00:51:03,424;or we'll spend the rest
837;00:51:01,534;00:51:03,424;of our lives rotting away
838;00:51:03,449;00:51:04,470;at the edge of the world.
839;00:51:04,471;00:51:06,905;Rich men do not become rich
839;00:51:04,471;00:51:06,905;by giving more than they get.
840;00:51:06,939;00:51:09,674;They'll give you ships and soldiers
840;00:51:06,939;00:51:09,674;and they'll own you forever.
841;00:51:09,709;00:51:13,444;Moving carefully is the hard way,
841;00:51:09,709;00:51:13,444;but it's the right way.
842;00:51:13,479;00:51:14,912;And if I'd listened
842;00:51:13,479;00:51:14,912;to that advice
843;00:51:14,946;00:51:17,148;outside the gates of Qarth,
843;00:51:14,946;00:51:17,148;we'd all be dead by now.
844;00:51:17,182;00:51:20,251;I know the opportunity before you
844;00:51:17,182;00:51:20,251;seems like the last you'll ever have,
845;00:51:20,285;00:51:20,992;but you must--
846;00:51:21,017;00:51:23,017;Do not speak to me
846;00:51:21,017;00:51:23,017;like I'm a child.
847;00:51:26,425;00:51:28,793;I only want--
847;00:51:26,425;00:51:28,793;What do you want?
848;00:51:28,827;00:51:31,395;Tell me.
849;00:51:31,430;00:51:32,964;To see you
849;00:51:31,430;00:51:32,964;on the Iron Throne.
850;00:51:32,998;00:51:35,733;Why?
850;00:51:32,998;00:51:35,733;You have a good claim.
851;00:51:35,767;00:51:38,569;A title.
851;00:51:35,767;00:51:38,569;A birthright.
852;00:51:38,603;00:51:41,805;But you have something
852;00:51:38,603;00:51:41,805;more than that.
853;00:51:41,839;00:51:46,076;You may cover it up and deny it,
853;00:51:41,839;00:51:46,076;but you have a gentle heart.
854;00:51:46,111;00:51:48,612;You would not only
854;00:51:46,111;00:51:48,612;be respected and feared,
855;00:51:48,647;00:51:51,148;you would be loved.
856;00:51:51,182;00:51:53,316;Someone who can rule
856;00:51:51,182;00:51:53,316;and should rule.
857;00:51:53,351;00:51:55,440;Centuries come and go
857;00:51:53,351;00:51:55,440;without a person like that
858;00:51:55,465;00:51:57,465;coming into the world.
859;00:51:58,155;00:51:59,722;There are times
859;00:51:58,155;00:51:59,722;when I look at you
860;00:51:59,756;00:52:02,624;and still can't
860;00:51:59,756;00:52:02,624;believe you're real.
861;00:52:14,603;00:52:17,939;So what would you
861;00:52:14,603;00:52:17,939;have me do as my advisor?
862;00:52:23,912;00:52:25,712;Make your own way.
863;00:52:25,747;00:52:28,548;Find your own ship.
863;00:52:25,747;00:52:28,548;You only need one.
864;00:52:28,582;00:52:32,018;The allies we need
864;00:52:28,582;00:52:32,018;are in Westeros, not Qarth.
865;00:52:33,254;00:52:35,722;And how do I get
865;00:52:33,254;00:52:35,722;the ship?
866;00:52:35,756;00:52:38,258;I'll find it for you.
867;00:52:38,292;00:52:40,427;A sound ship
867;00:52:38,292;00:52:40,427;with a good captain.
868;00:52:46,035;00:52:48,736;I look forward
868;00:52:46,035;00:52:48,736;to meeting him.
869;00:52:52,007;00:52:54,141;Khaleesi.
870;00:53:23,674;00:53:25,810;You should stand
870;00:53:23,674;00:53:25,810;sideface.
871;00:53:25,844;00:53:27,979;Sideface?
872;00:53:28,013;00:53:30,115;Sideways.
873;00:53:30,149;00:53:32,550;Why?
