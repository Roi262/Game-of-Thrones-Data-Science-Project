23;00:00:52,815;00:00:54,337;This is about

24;00:00:54,361;00:00:56,136;through the tunnel.

25;00:00:56,160;00:00:59,104;when the real war begins.

28;00:01:03,953;00:01:05,882;we can beat them.
29;00:01:12,306;00:01:14,404;We still have a hard march

30;00:01:14,428;00:01:16,412;anywhere in this weather.
31;00:01:16,436;00:01:18,534;It's better to wait for the right time
31;00:01:16,436;00:01:18,534;than risk everything.
32;00:01:18,558;00:01:20,913;This is the right time

33;00:01:20,937;00:01:23,482;Because if I don't,
33;00:01:20,937;00:01:23,482;we've lost.
34;00:01:23,974;00:01:26,133;I have shown you

39;00:01:36,204;00:01:37,480;even if we wanted to.
40;00:01:37,504;00:01:38,703;I don't need an army.
41;00:01:38,727;00:01:40,679;I need 20 good men.

110;00:11:12,637;00:11:15,271;Ser Byron Swann wanted
110;00:11:12,637;00:11:15,271;to kill the dragon Vhagar.
111;00:11:15,306;00:11:18,274;He polished his shield
111;00:11:15,306;00:11:18,274;for a week so that it was like a mirror.
112;00:11:18,309;00:11:20,359;And he crouched behind it
112;00:11:18,309;00:11:20,359;and crept forward,
113;00:11:20,395;00:11:22,435;hoping the dragon would
113;00:11:20,395;00:11:22,435;only see its own reflection.
114;00:11:22,447;00:11:25,565;But the dragon saw
114;00:11:22,447;00:11:25,565;a dumb man holding a mirrored shield.
115;00:11:25,567;00:11:27,233;And burnt him
115;00:11:25,567;00:11:27,233;to a crisp.
116;00:11:28,486;00:11:30,870;Thus ending

118;00:11:36,077;00:11:38,327;I made you something,

122;00:11:50,925;00:11:53,426;So that he can have company?
123;00:11:53,478;00:11:55,311;Of course I will.
124;00:11:56,764;00:11:58,397;But why am I
124;00:11:56,764;00:11:58,397;getting a present?
125;00:11:59,984;00:12:01,484;Because you deserve it.
126;00:12:03,188;00:12:06,656;My son was always on me,
126;00:12:03,188;00:12:06,656;trying to teach me to read.
127;00:12:06,691;00:12:09,025;Gods, I was stubborn
127;00:12:06,691;00:12:09,025;about it.
128;00:12:10,361;00:12:11,994;Made it this far
128;00:12:10,361;00:12:11,994;without reading.
129;00:12:12,030;00:12:14,530;Seemed to me I could
129;00:12:12,030;00:12:14,530;make it to the grave.
130;00:12:16,784;00:12:18,784;Wish I'd listened to him.
131;00:12:20,255;00:12:22,622;This is my own poor way
131;00:12:20,255;00:12:22,622;of saying thank you.
132;00:12:26,211;00:12:28,377;For teaching me
132;00:12:26,211;00:12:28,377;to be a grown-up.
133;00:12:31,049;00:12:33,849;I'll be gone for a few days,
133;00:12:31,049;00:12:33,849;Princess.
134;00:12:33,885;00:12:36,552;I want to hear all about
134;00:12:33,885;00:12:36,552;The Dance of Dragons when I'm back.
135;00:12:36,604;00:12:38,854;You'll read it yourself.
136;00:13:00,378;00:13:01,827;Prince Doran.
137;00:13:01,829;00:13:04,413;Forgive us.
137;00:13:01,829;00:13:04,413;We started without you.
138;00:13:05,300;00:13:07,166;Please, sit.
139;00:13:07,252;00:13:09,719;Princess Myrcella.
140;00:13:09,804;00:13:11,387;Uncle.
141;00:13:11,472;00:13:13,272;What a lovely dress.
142;00:13:13,308;00:13:15,608;You don't like it?
142;00:13:13,308;00:13:15,608;You must be cold.
143;00:13:15,677;00:13:19,278;Not at all.
143;00:13:15,677;00:13:19,278;The Dornish climate agrees with me.
144;00:13:20,431;00:13:23,149;Prince Trystane.
145;00:13:25,153;00:13:26,485;How's your jaw?
146;00:13:27,655;00:13:29,322;A fleabite.
147;00:13:29,357;00:13:30,940;What are you
147;00:13:29,357;00:13:30,940;doing in Dorne?
148;00:13:30,992;00:13:33,242;Looking after the safety of my niece,
148;00:13:30,992;00:13:33,242;the Princess Myrcella.
149;00:13:33,278;00:13:36,612;And rather than send a raven
149;00:13:33,278;00:13:36,612;or speak to me directly,
150;00:13:36,698;00:13:38,998;you decided to enter
150;00:13:36,698;00:13:38,998;my country in secret
151;00:13:39,033;00:13:40,666;and abduct our guest
151;00:13:39,033;00:13:40,666;by force?
152;00:13:40,702;00:13:43,919;We received
152;00:13:40,702;00:13:43,919;a threatening message.
153;00:13:43,955;00:13:47,173;The princess's necklace
153;00:13:43,955;00:13:47,173;in the jaws of a viper.
154;00:13:48,509;00:13:50,509;That necklace
154;00:13:48,509;00:13:50,509;was stolen from my room.
155;00:13:55,516;00:13:59,268;Oh, excellent.
156;00:13:59,304;00:14:01,520;A last meal before
156;00:13:59,304;00:14:01,520;the beheading?
157;00:14:01,556;00:14:03,105;Oh, I can't behead you.
158;00:14:03,141;00:14:05,558;Many in Dorne want war.
159;00:14:05,610;00:14:07,560;But I've seen war.
160;00:14:07,612;00:14:10,363;I've seen the bodies
160;00:14:07,612;00:14:10,363;piled on the battlefields.
161;00:14:10,398;00:14:13,899;I've seen the orphans
161;00:14:10,398;00:14:13,899;starving in the cities.
162;00:14:13,901;00:14:15,985;I don't want to lead
162;00:14:13,901;00:14:15,985;my people into that hell.
163;00:14:16,070;00:14:18,738;No, you want to break bread
163;00:14:16,070;00:14:18,738;with the Lannisters.
164;00:14:18,740;00:14:21,374;And that is precisely
164;00:14:18,740;00:14:21,374;what we are doing.
165;00:14:23,211;00:14:26,796;Let us drink to Tommen,
165;00:14:23,211;00:14:26,796;the First of His Name,
166;00:14:26,831;00:14:29,332;King of the Andals
166;00:14:26,831;00:14:29,332;and the First Men,
167;00:14:29,384;00:14:31,550;Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
168;00:14:48,986;00:14:51,404;King Tommen insists
169;00:14:51,439;00:14:54,407;on his sister's return
169;00:14:51,439;00:14:54,407;to the capital?
170;00:14:54,442;00:14:56,575;I'm afraid he does.
171;00:14:58,579;00:15:01,697;I cannot disobey
171;00:14:58,579;00:15:01,697;my king's command.
172;00:15:01,749;00:15:04,200;She will return with you
172;00:15:01,749;00:15:04,200;to King's Landing.
173;00:15:04,252;00:15:07,670;And my son Prince Trystane
173;00:15:04,252;00:15:07,670;will accompany you both.
174;00:15:07,705;00:15:11,340;If the alliance between
174;00:15:07,705;00:15:11,340;the Iron Throne and Dorne is to continue,
175;00:15:11,426;00:15:12,842;their engagement
175;00:15:11,426;00:15:12,842;must stand.
176;00:15:12,927;00:15:14,960;I accept.
177;00:15:15,012;00:15:17,680;One more thing.
177;00:15:15,012;00:15:17,680;My brother was named
178;00:15:17,715;00:15:20,383;to the small council
178;00:15:17,715;00:15:20,383;before his death.
179;00:15:20,435;00:15:22,351;Your father understood
179;00:15:20,435;00:15:22,351;the importance
180;00:15:22,387;00:15:24,220;of keeping Dorne
180;00:15:22,387;00:15:24,220;in the fold.
181;00:15:24,272;00:15:28,808;With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take
181;00:15:24,272;00:15:28,808;his place on the small council.
182;00:15:28,893;00:15:29,975;You have my word.
183;00:15:30,061;00:15:32,528;The word
183;00:15:30,061;00:15:32,528;of a kingslayer.
184;00:15:34,565;00:15:39,068;No wonder you can't stand.
184;00:15:34,565;00:15:39,068;You have no spine.
185;00:15:39,120;00:15:41,370;You are mother
185;00:15:39,120;00:15:41,370;to four of my nieces,
186;00:15:41,456;00:15:43,155;girls I love very much.
187;00:15:43,207;00:15:45,991;For their sake, I hope you live
187;00:15:43,207;00:15:45,991;a long and happy life.
188;00:15:46,043;00:15:48,544;Speak to me that way again,
188;00:15:46,043;00:15:48,544;and you won't.
189;00:15:56,337;00:16:00,005;May I inquire as to the fate
189;00:15:56,337;00:16:00,005;of my man Bronn?
190;00:16:00,057;00:16:03,175;Tell me, Ser Jaime,
190;00:16:00,057;00:16:03,175;in King's Landing,
191;00:16:03,177;00:16:06,479;how do they punish a commoner
191;00:16:03,177;00:16:06,479;who strikes a prince?
192;00:16:06,514;00:16:08,063;He said it was
192;00:16:06,514;00:16:08,063;just a fleabite.
193;00:16:10,818;00:16:12,234;The fault is mine.
194;00:16:12,270;00:16:14,520;Bronn is merely a soldier
194;00:16:12,270;00:16:14,520;following my orders.
195;00:16:14,572;00:16:18,107;If anyone should
195;00:16:14,572;00:16:18,107;be punished, it's me.
196;00:16:18,159;00:16:21,026;Prince Trystane must learn judgment
196;00:16:18,159;00:16:21,026;if he is to rule one day.
197;00:16:21,078;00:16:22,778;I'll let him decide.
198;00:16:27,585;00:16:30,202;I have learned the value of mercy
198;00:16:27,585;00:16:30,202;from my father.
199;00:16:30,254;00:16:33,672;- I'll set your man free.
199;00:16:30,254;00:16:33,672;You're a good man.
200;00:16:33,708;00:16:36,542;On one condition.
201;00:16:44,385;00:16:46,602;Why do we play?
201;00:16:44,385;00:16:46,602;I'm better than you.
202;00:16:46,637;00:16:48,971;I'll always
202;00:16:46,637;00:16:48,971;be better than you.
203;00:16:49,023;00:16:51,857;Have I ever missed once?
204;00:16:51,893;00:16:54,777;I don't think I have.
204;00:16:51,893;00:16:54,777;I can't recall.
205;00:16:54,812;00:16:57,396;You must love humiliation.
205;00:16:54,812;00:16:57,396;Or pain.
206;00:16:57,448;00:17:01,116;Which do you love most,
206;00:16:57,448;00:17:01,116;humiliation or pain?
207;00:17:02,203;00:17:04,069;That one hurt,
207;00:17:02,203;00:17:04,069;didn't it?
208;00:17:04,121;00:17:07,072;You going to cry?
209;00:17:07,124;00:17:09,041;Give up, little sister.
210;00:17:09,076;00:17:11,126;You're going to miss.
210;00:17:09,076;00:17:11,126;Oh, I never miss.
211;00:17:11,162;00:17:14,463;You will.
211;00:17:11,162;00:17:14,463;You're thinking too much.
212;00:17:14,499;00:17:17,550;Now you're nervous.
212;00:17:14,499;00:17:17,550;What if she's right?
213;00:17:20,972;00:17:23,756;Luck.
213;00:17:20,972;00:17:23,756;Now it's my turn.
214;00:17:23,808;00:17:25,424;You're too slow.
215;00:17:25,476;00:17:27,309;You've always been
215;00:17:25,476;00:17:27,309;too slow.
216;00:17:44,078;00:17:45,911;Am I gonna be happy
216;00:17:44,078;00:17:45,911;at the end of this walk?
217;00:17:45,947;00:17:47,997;You'll find out
217;00:17:45,947;00:17:47,997;very soon.
218;00:17:50,952;00:17:52,751;Say it one more time,
218;00:17:50,952;00:17:52,751;handsome.
219;00:17:52,787;00:17:54,203;Who am I?
220;00:17:55,540;00:17:58,123;The most beautiful
220;00:17:55,540;00:17:58,123;woman in the world.
221;00:17:58,175;00:17:59,542;And that's the truth.
222;00:17:59,594;00:18:02,211;Slut.
223;00:18:02,263;00:18:04,213;Prince Doran,
224;00:18:04,265;00:18:07,299;Ser Bronn
224;00:18:04,265;00:18:07,299;of the Blackwater.
225;00:18:07,335;00:18:09,702;I didn't realize there were
225;00:18:07,335;00:18:09,702;knights of the Blackwater.
226;00:18:09,737;00:18:11,337;Only the one.
227;00:18:11,372;00:18:13,906;I believe you've already
227;00:18:11,372;00:18:13,906;met Prince Trystane.
228;00:18:13,941;00:18:16,141;Prince.
229;00:18:16,143;00:18:17,893;Sorry about
229;00:18:16,143;00:18:17,893;the other day.
230;00:18:17,979;00:18:20,396;Prince Trystane here
230;00:18:17,979;00:18:20,396;is a man of mercy.
231;00:18:20,448;00:18:22,781;He's agreed to grant
231;00:18:20,448;00:18:22,781;you your freedom.
232;00:18:24,402;00:18:26,485;I'm glad to hear it.
233;00:18:27,989;00:18:29,321;Pie looks good.
234;00:18:29,323;00:18:31,957;There was one condition.
235;00:18:41,052;00:18:43,385;Perhaps some soup
235;00:18:41,052;00:18:43,385;instead.
236;00:18:45,339;00:18:48,757;Oysters, clams, and cockles.
237;00:18:50,595;00:18:53,729;Oysters, clams,
237;00:18:50,595;00:18:53,729;and cockles.

240;00:18:59,854;00:19:01,520;How much
240;00:18:59,854;00:19:01,520;for your little clam?
241;00:19:10,164;00:19:13,032;Oysters, clams,
241;00:19:10,164;00:19:13,032;and cockles.
242;00:19:15,920;00:19:18,954;Oysters, clams,

244;00:19:50,905;00:19:53,906;Some oysters, girl!
245;00:19:53,958;00:19:56,625;I'm talking to you.
246;00:19:56,661;00:19:58,994;Is, uh...

372;00:30:28,592;00:30:31,376;Both of them thought
372;00:30:28,592;00:30:31,376;they belonged on the Iron Throne.
373;00:30:31,428;00:30:34,713;When people started
373;00:30:31,428;00:30:34,713;declaring for one of them or the other,
374;00:30:34,715;00:30:36,965;their fight divided
374;00:30:34,715;00:30:36,965;the kingdoms in two.
375;00:30:37,050;00:30:40,385;Brothers fought brothers,
375;00:30:37,050;00:30:40,385;dragons fought dragons.
376;00:30:42,055;00:30:46,057;By the time it was over,
376;00:30:42,055;00:30:46,057;thousands were dead.
377;00:30:46,059;00:30:49,060;And it was a disaster
377;00:30:46,059;00:30:49,060;for the Targaryens as well.
378;00:30:49,062;00:30:51,813;They never truly recovered.
379;00:30:51,865;00:30:53,865;The Dance of Dragons.
380;00:30:55,619;00:30:57,652;Why is that a dance?
381;00:30:57,704;00:30:59,154;It's just what
381;00:30:57,704;00:30:59,154;they call it.
382;00:30:59,206;00:31:01,406;Hmm, doesn't make
382;00:30:59,206;00:31:01,406;much sense.
383;00:31:01,458;00:31:03,375;I think it's poetic.
384;00:31:10,217;00:31:12,751;If you had to choose
385;00:31:12,803;00:31:16,137;between Rhaenyra
385;00:31:12,803;00:31:16,137;and Aegon...
386;00:31:17,724;00:31:19,224;who would you
386;00:31:17,724;00:31:19,224;have chosen?
387;00:31:19,259;00:31:21,810;I wouldn't have
387;00:31:19,259;00:31:21,810;chosen either.
388;00:31:21,845;00:31:25,013;It's all the choosing sides
388;00:31:21,845;00:31:25,013;that made everything so horrible.
389;00:31:25,065;00:31:27,349;Sometimes a person
389;00:31:25,065;00:31:27,349;has to choose.
390;00:31:29,436;00:31:32,687;Sometimes the world
390;00:31:29,436;00:31:32,687;forces his hand.
391;00:31:34,691;00:31:37,575;If a man knows
391;00:31:34,691;00:31:37,575;what he is...
392;00:31:38,945;00:31:41,780;and remains true
392;00:31:38,945;00:31:41,780;to himself...
393;00:31:45,285;00:31:47,452;the choice
393;00:31:45,285;00:31:47,452;is no choice at all.
394;00:31:47,537;00:31:50,588;He must fulfill
394;00:31:47,537;00:31:50,588;his destiny...
395;00:31:52,793;00:31:56,261;and become
395;00:31:52,793;00:31:56,261;who he is meant to be.
396;00:31:58,465;00:32:00,799;However much
396;00:31:58,465;00:32:00,799;he may hate it.
397;00:32:02,052;00:32:04,969;It's all right, Father.
398;00:32:04,971;00:32:07,806;You don't even know
398;00:32:04,971;00:32:07,806;what I'm talking about.
399;00:32:07,858;00:32:09,641;It doesn't matter.
400;00:32:09,643;00:32:11,893;I want to help you.
401;00:32:11,945;00:32:13,611;Is there any way
401;00:32:11,945;00:32:13,611;I can help?
402;00:32:21,455;00:32:22,871;Yes, there is.
403;00:32:22,906;00:32:24,739;Good. I want to.
404;00:32:27,577;00:32:29,794;I'm the Princess Shireen
404;00:32:27,577;00:32:29,794;of House Baratheon.
405;00:32:29,830;00:32:32,080;And I'm your daughter.
406;00:32:46,346;00:32:48,313;Forgive me.
407;00:33:29,439;00:33:31,806;Where's my father?
407;00:33:29,439;00:33:31,806;I want to see my father.
408;00:33:31,858;00:33:34,976;It will all be over
408;00:33:31,858;00:33:34,976;soon, Princess.
409;00:33:38,949;00:33:40,398;No.
410;00:33:43,236;00:33:45,236;Where's my father?
411;00:33:45,288;00:33:47,739;No, you can't do this.
411;00:33:45,288;00:33:47,739;Father, where are you?
412;00:33:47,791;00:33:50,241;Please, let me
412;00:33:47,791;00:33:50,241;see my father.
413;00:33:50,293;00:33:53,127;Father, where are you?
413;00:33:50,293;00:33:53,127;Don't let her do this.
414;00:33:54,080;00:33:56,831;Please let go!
415;00:33:56,883;00:34:00,168;Let me see my father!
415;00:33:56,883;00:34:00,168;Where are you? Please!
416;00:34:00,920;00:34:03,287;It's what the Lord wants.
416;00:34:00,920;00:34:03,287;No.
417;00:34:03,289;00:34:06,340;- Please! Let go! No!
417;00:34:03,289;00:34:06,340;It's a good thing.
418;00:34:06,375;00:34:08,509;A great thing.
418;00:34:06,375;00:34:08,509;-  Stop. Stop!
419;00:34:08,544;00:34:10,210;- Please!
419;00:34:08,544;00:34:10,210;- Hear us now, my Lord.
420;00:34:10,211;00:34:11,162;You can't do this!
421;00:34:11,186;00:34:12,545;For you, we offer up this girl
422;00:34:12,546;00:34:13,408;Please!
423;00:34:13,432;00:34:15,396;...that you may cleanse
423;00:34:13,432;00:34:15,396;her with your fire
424;00:34:15,397;00:34:17,347;and that its light
424;00:34:15,397;00:34:17,347;may lead our way.
425;00:34:17,398;00:34:19,431;Please!
425;00:34:17,398;00:34:19,431;No, please let me see my father.
426;00:34:19,433;00:34:21,600;If we don't act,
426;00:34:19,433;00:34:21,600;we'll all starve here.
427;00:34:21,652;00:34:23,602;All of us.
428;00:34:23,654;00:34:25,320;But if we make
428;00:34:23,654;00:34:25,320;this sacrifice...
429;00:34:25,356;00:34:27,573;Accept this token
429;00:34:25,356;00:34:27,573;of our faith, my Lord,
430;00:34:27,608;00:34:30,442;and lead us
430;00:34:27,608;00:34:30,442;from the darkness.
431;00:34:30,494;00:34:33,445;Lord of Light, show us the way.
431;00:34:30,494;00:34:33,445;Mother!
432;00:34:33,531;00:34:35,614;Mother, please!
433;00:34:37,585;00:34:39,117;Mother, please!
433;00:34:37,585;00:34:39,117;Mother!
434;00:34:39,119;00:34:41,203;- Mother!
434;00:34:39,119;00:34:41,203;We can't.
435;00:34:41,255;00:34:41,943;There's no other way.
436;00:34:41,944;00:34:43,289;She has king's blood.
436;00:34:41,944;00:34:43,289;Please don't do this!
437;00:34:43,290;00:34:45,290;Lord of Light,
437;00:34:43,290;00:34:45,290;protect us.
438;00:34:45,342;00:34:46,547;Please! Father, please!
439;00:34:46,572;00:34:48,572;For the night is dark
439;00:34:46,572;00:34:48,572;and full of terrors.
440;00:34:49,346;00:34:50,963;Father!
441;00:34:51,015;00:34:53,015;Father, don't do this!
441;00:34:51,015;00:34:53,015;Please!
442;00:34:53,050;00:34:56,435;Mother, no! Please!
442;00:34:53,050;00:34:56,435;Please, help!
443;00:34:56,470;00:34:58,804;Don't do this!
444;00:34:58,856;00:35:01,473;Please, Father!
444;00:34:58,856;00:35:01,473;Mother, help!
445;00:35:01,525;00:35:02,683;No.
446;00:35:02,707;00:35:04,707;No, please!
446;00:35:02,707;00:35:04,707;Don't do this!
447;00:35:04,895;00:35:08,196;Don't do this,
447;00:35:04,895;00:35:08,196;please, Mother!
448;00:35:08,282;00:35:12,117;Please, Mother!
448;00:35:08,282;00:35:12,117;Mother, help!
449;00:35:12,152;00:35:15,153;Mother, help!
449;00:35:12,152;00:35:15,153;Help!
450;00:35:15,205;00:35:17,322;Please don't
450;00:35:15,205;00:35:17,322;do this, Mother!
451;00:35:17,374;00:35:18,824;Please!
452;00:35:18,826;00:35:21,043;Please, Mother!
452;00:35:18,826;00:35:21,043;Please!
453;00:35:21,078;00:35:23,161;Please! No!
454;00:35:23,213;00:35:27,049;Please! No!
455;00:35:44,184;00:35:47,185;No!
456;00:36:36,737;00:36:38,370;Where have you been?
457;00:36:38,405;00:36:40,539;Just making sure
457;00:36:38,405;00:36:40,539;everything is in order.
458;00:38:11,131;00:38:13,799;They're waiting for you.
459;00:38:13,834;00:38:15,801;Clap your hands.
460;00:38:45,199;00:38:46,865;That one,
460;00:38:45,199;00:38:46,865;the smaller man.
461;00:38:46,867;00:38:48,667;No question, that's where you
461;00:38:46,867;00:38:48,667;should put your money.
462;00:38:48,702;00:38:50,085;The smaller man it is.
463;00:38:50,120;00:38:52,003;I'm not putting
463;00:38:50,120;00:38:52,003;my money anywhere.
464;00:38:52,039;00:38:54,206;Kings and queens
464;00:38:52,039;00:38:54,206;never bet on the games.
465;00:38:54,208;00:38:56,508;Perhaps you should go
465;00:38:54,208;00:38:56,508;find someone who does.
466;00:38:56,543;00:38:59,461;People used to bet against me when
466;00:38:56,543;00:38:59,461;I fought in the pits.
467;00:38:59,513;00:39:02,547;He would have bet against me.
467;00:38:59,513;00:39:02,547;Common novice mistake.
468;00:39:02,549;00:39:04,599;I've spent much
468;00:39:02,549;00:39:04,599;of my life in this arena.
469;00:39:04,635;00:39:06,635;And in my experience,
469;00:39:04,635;00:39:06,635;large men do triumph
470;00:39:06,687;00:39:08,970;over smaller men
470;00:39:06,687;00:39:08,970;far more often than not.
471;00:39:09,022;00:39:11,890;Has your experience
471;00:39:09,022;00:39:11,890;ever involved any actual fighting?
472;00:39:11,942;00:39:13,558;You yourself?
473;00:39:13,610;00:39:16,528;Have you ever tried to kill another man
473;00:39:13,610;00:39:16,528;who was trying to kill you?
474;00:39:18,649;00:39:21,449;Whenever I got into the pit
474;00:39:18,649;00:39:21,449;against a beast like that one,
475;00:39:21,485;00:39:24,152;the crowd saw me,
475;00:39:21,485;00:39:24,152;all skin and bone back then,
476;00:39:24,204;00:39:27,489;then they saw a pile of angry muscles
476;00:39:24,204;00:39:27,489;ready to murder me.
477;00:39:27,541;00:39:29,741;They couldn't get their
477;00:39:27,541;00:39:29,741;money out fast enough.
478;00:39:29,743;00:39:33,245;But the pile of angry muscles
478;00:39:29,743;00:39:33,245;never had any muscles here
479;00:39:33,247;00:39:36,631;or... here.
480;00:39:36,667;00:39:38,416;And the big men
480;00:39:36,667;00:39:38,416;were always too slow
481;00:39:38,468;00:39:41,303;to stop my dagger from going
481;00:39:38,468;00:39:41,303;where their muscles weren't.
482;00:39:41,338;00:39:45,173;Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one
482;00:39:41,338;00:39:45,173;standing across from me
483;00:39:45,225;00:39:49,311;making his beast faces,
483;00:39:45,225;00:39:49,311;I knew I could rest easy.
484;00:40:01,158;00:40:03,158;You don't approve?
485;00:40:03,193;00:40:06,111;There's always been more than enough death
485;00:40:03,193;00:40:06,111;in the world for my taste.
486;00:40:06,113;00:40:08,113;I can do without it
486;00:40:06,113;00:40:08,113;in my leisure time.
487;00:40:08,115;00:40:10,582;Fair enough.
487;00:40:08,115;00:40:10,582;Yet it's an unpleasant question,
488;00:40:10,617;00:40:15,003;but what great thing has ever been
488;00:40:10,617;00:40:15,003;accomplished without killing or cruelty?
489;00:40:15,088;00:40:18,340;It's easy to confuse what is
489;00:40:15,088;00:40:18,340;with what ought to be,
490;00:40:18,375;00:40:21,126;especially when what is
490;00:40:18,375;00:40:21,126;has worked out in your favor.
491;00:40:21,178;00:40:22,677;I'm not talking
491;00:40:21,178;00:40:22,677;about myself.
492;00:40:22,713;00:40:25,347;I'm talking about
492;00:40:22,713;00:40:25,347;the necessary conditions for greatness.
493;00:40:25,382;00:40:27,299;That is greatness?
494;00:40:27,351;00:40:31,303;That is a vital part
494;00:40:27,351;00:40:31,303;of the great city of Meereen,
495;00:40:31,305;00:40:33,805;which existed
495;00:40:31,305;00:40:33,805;long before you or I
496;00:40:33,807;00:40:37,893;and will remain standing
496;00:40:33,807;00:40:37,893;long after we have returned to the dirt.
497;00:40:37,945;00:40:39,978;My father
497;00:40:37,945;00:40:39,978;would have liked you.
498;00:40:52,292;00:40:54,576;One day your great city
498;00:40:52,292;00:40:54,576;will return to the dirt as well.
499;00:40:54,628;00:40:56,878;At your command?
499;00:40:54,628;00:40:56,878;If need be.
500;00:41:03,242;00:41:05,242;And how many people will die
500;00:41:03,242;00:41:05,242;to make this happen?
501;00:41:05,505;00:41:08,890;If it comes to that, they will have died
501;00:41:05,505;00:41:08,890;for a good reason.
502;00:41:08,926;00:41:11,009;Those men think they're
502;00:41:08,926;00:41:11,009;dying for a good reason.
503;00:41:11,061;00:41:12,844;Someone else's reason.
504;00:41:12,846;00:41:15,180;So your reasons are true
504;00:41:12,846;00:41:15,180;and theirs are false?
505;00:41:15,232;00:41:18,099;They don't know their own minds,
505;00:41:15,232;00:41:18,099;but you do?
506;00:41:18,151;00:41:21,152;Well said.
506;00:41:18,151;00:41:21,152;You're an eloquent man.
507;00:41:21,188;00:41:22,854;Doesn't mean you're wrong.
508;00:41:22,906;00:41:25,073;In my experience,
508;00:41:22,906;00:41:25,073;eloquent men are right
509;00:41:25,108;00:41:26,858;every bit as often
509;00:41:25,108;00:41:26,858;as imbeciles.
510;00:41:53,937;00:41:56,805;Your Grace--
510;00:41:53,937;00:41:56,805;Shut your mouth.
511;00:44:23,253;00:44:25,370;You can end this.
511;00:44:23,253;00:44:25,370;She cannot.
512;00:44:25,422;00:44:27,956;You can.
513;00:46:05,522;00:46:08,022;Protect your queen!
514;00:46:18,568;00:46:20,318;Go!
515;00:46:44,427;00:46:46,427;Your Grace!
515;00:46:44,427;00:46:46,427;Your Grace!
516;00:46:46,513;00:46:47,713;Come with me.
516;00:46:46,513;00:46:47,713;I know a way out.
517;00:46:47,731;00:46:49,147;I know a way--
518;00:47:24,968;00:47:26,100;Stay close.
519;00:47:33,643;00:47:35,059;This way.
520;00:47:46,456;00:47:47,622;The other side.
521;00:47:47,657;00:47:49,824;Follow me.
522;00:47:52,078;00:47:54,245;Protect your queen!
523;00:50:48,054;00:50:49,887;Drogon!
