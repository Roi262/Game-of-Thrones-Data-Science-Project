143;00:09:45,137;00:09:46,704;It had to be recently.
144;00:09:46,738;00:09:48,706;You weren't with her
144;00:09:46,738;00:09:48,706;at Winterfell.
145;00:09:48,740;00:09:50,140;How would you know?
146;00:09:50,175;00:09:52,977;Because I visited Winterfell.
147;00:09:53,011;00:09:54,745;I would have noticed
147;00:09:53,011;00:09:54,745;your dour head
148;00:09:54,779;00:09:56,714;smacking into the archways.
149;00:09:56,748;00:09:58,249;Move.
150;00:10:03,889;00:10:06,357;Were you pledged to Stannis?
150;00:10:03,889;00:10:06,357;Gods, no.
151;00:10:06,391;00:10:08,292;Ah, Renly.
152;00:10:08,327;00:10:09,894;Really?
153;00:10:09,928;00:10:11,629;He wasn't fit
153;00:10:09,928;00:10:11,629;to rule over anything
154;00:10:11,663;00:10:13,497;more important than
154;00:10:11,663;00:10:13,497;a 12-course meal.
155;00:10:13,531;00:10:15,099;Shut your mouth.
155;00:10:13,531;00:10:15,099;Why?
156;00:10:15,133;00:10:18,402;I lived with him at court since
156;00:10:15,133;00:10:18,402;he was a boy, don't forget.
157;00:10:18,436;00:10:20,537;Could hardly escape
157;00:10:18,436;00:10:20,537;the little tulip.

158;00:10:20,572;00:10:23,573;in his embroidered silks.
159;00:10:23,608;00:10:25,442;I knew him far better than you.
160;00:10:25,476;00:10:27,444;I knew him as well as anyone.
161;00:10:27,479;00:10:29,013;As a member of his Kingsguard,
162;00:10:29,047;00:10:30,815;he trusted me with everything.
163;00:10:30,849;00:10:32,249;He would have been
163;00:10:30,849;00:10:32,249;a wonderful king.
164;00:10:32,284;00:10:33,751;Sounds like you
164;00:10:32,284;00:10:33,751;quite fancied him.
165;00:10:33,785;00:10:36,020;I did not fancy him.
166;00:10:36,054;00:10:37,689;Oh, gods, you did.
167;00:10:38,724;00:10:40,558;Did you ever tell him?
168;00:10:40,592;00:10:43,394;No, of course not.
169;00:10:43,428;00:10:46,397;You weren't Renly's
169;00:10:43,428;00:10:46,397;type, I'm afraid.
170;00:10:46,431;00:10:50,268;He preferred curly-haired
170;00:10:46,431;00:10:50,268;little girls like Loras Tyrell.
171;00:10:50,302;00:10:51,669;You're far too much
171;00:10:50,302;00:10:51,669;man for him.
172;00:10:51,704;00:10:53,504;I'm not interested
172;00:10:51,704;00:10:53,504;in foul rumors.
173;00:10:53,539;00:10:55,540;Unless they're about me.
174;00:10:55,574;00:10:57,909;It's all true about Renly.
175;00:10:57,944;00:11:00,846;His proclivities were the
175;00:10:57,944;00:11:00,846;worst kept secret at court.
176;00:11:00,880;00:11:03,215;It's a shame the throne
176;00:11:00,880;00:11:03,215;isn't made out of cocks.
177;00:11:03,249;00:11:06,151;They'd have never got him off it.
177;00:11:03,249;00:11:06,151;Shut your mouth!
178;00:11:07,721;00:11:09,722;I don't blame him.
179;00:11:09,756;00:11:11,757;And I don't blame you, either.
180;00:11:11,792;00:11:14,994;We don't get to choose
180;00:11:11,792;00:11:14,994;who we love.

187;00:11:38,153;00:11:40,354;safe enough, though.

192;00:11:55,704;00:11:57,638;He knows who I am.
193;00:11:57,672;00:11:59,106;He doesn't.
193;00:11:57,672;00:11:59,106;Maybe you're right.
194;00:11:59,140;00:12:01,875;But what if you're not?
194;00:11:59,140;00:12:01,875;What if he tells someone?
195;00:12:04,379;00:12:06,781;We're not doing it.
196;00:12:06,815;00:12:09,050;He's an innocent man.
197;00:12:09,084;00:12:11,619;More innocent than

200;00:12:29,503;00:12:31,170;It makes you look very strong.

283;00:17:01,429;00:17:03,798;for your losses.
284;00:17:03,832;00:17:07,501;And I was sorry when I heard of
284;00:17:03,832;00:17:07,501;Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery.
285;00:17:07,536;00:17:09,737;He was very gallant.
285;00:17:07,536;00:17:09,737;Gallant, yes.
286;00:17:09,771;00:17:12,006;And charming and very clean.
287;00:17:12,074;00:17:13,941;He knew how to dress and smile
288;00:17:13,976;00:17:16,811;and somehow this gave him the
288;00:17:13,976;00:17:16,811;notion he was fit to be king.
289;00:17:16,845;00:17:18,846;Renly was brave
289;00:17:16,845;00:17:18,846;and gentle, Grandmother.
290;00:17:18,881;00:17:20,548;Father liked him
290;00:17:18,881;00:17:20,548;and so did Loras.
291;00:17:20,582;00:17:22,217;Loras is young and very good
292;00:17:22,251;00:17:24,186;at knocking men
292;00:17:22,251;00:17:24,186;off horses with a stick.
293;00:17:24,220;00:17:26,888;That does not make him wise.
294;00:17:26,923;00:17:28,290;As to your
294;00:17:26,923;00:17:28,290;fathead father--
295;00:17:28,324;00:17:31,126;Grandmother! What will
295;00:17:28,324;00:17:31,126;Sansa think of us?
296;00:17:31,160;00:17:33,561;She might think we have
296;00:17:31,160;00:17:33,561;some wits about us.
297;00:17:33,596;00:17:35,296;One of us, at any rate.
298;00:17:35,364;00:17:38,066;It was treason.
298;00:17:35,364;00:17:38,066;I warned them.
299;00:17:38,134;00:17:41,036;Robert has two sons and
299;00:17:38,134;00:17:41,036;Renly has an older brother.
300;00:17:41,070;00:17:43,171;How could he possibly
300;00:17:41,070;00:17:43,171;have any claim
301;00:17:43,206;00:17:45,807;to that ugly iron chair?
302;00:17:45,841;00:17:48,877;We should have stayed well out
302;00:17:45,841;00:17:48,877;of all this if you ask me.
303;00:17:48,911;00:17:50,779;But once the cow's been milked,
304;00:17:50,814;00:17:53,382;there's no squirting
304;00:17:50,814;00:17:53,382;the cream back up her udders.
305;00:17:53,416;00:17:55,452;So here we are
305;00:17:53,416;00:17:55,452;to see things through.
306;00:17:55,486;00:17:58,089;What do you say to that, Sansa?
307;00:17:59,224;00:18:01,159;Shall we have some lemon cakes?
308;00:18:01,193;00:18:02,760;Lemon cake's my favorite.
309;00:18:02,795;00:18:04,929;So we've been told.
310;00:18:04,964;00:18:08,466;Are you going to bring the food or
310;00:18:04,964;00:18:08,466;do you mean to starve us to death?
311;00:18:09,368;00:18:11,302;Here, Sansa,
312;00:18:11,336;00:18:13,438;come sit with me.
313;00:18:13,472;00:18:16,908;I'm much less boring
313;00:18:13,472;00:18:16,908;than these others.
314;00:18:19,078;00:18:21,680;Do you know my son?
315;00:18:21,714;00:18:23,548;The Lord of Highgarden?
316;00:18:23,583;00:18:25,784;I haven't had the pleasure.
317;00:18:25,852;00:18:27,786;No great pleasure, believe me.
318;00:18:27,820;00:18:29,321;A ponderous oaf.
319;00:18:29,355;00:18:31,356;His father was an oaf as well.
320;00:18:31,391;00:18:34,159;My husband,
320;00:18:31,391;00:18:34,159;the late Lord Luthor.
321;00:18:34,194;00:18:37,095;He managed to ride off
321;00:18:34,194;00:18:37,095;a cliff whilst hawking.
322;00:18:37,130;00:18:39,298;They say he was looking
322;00:18:37,130;00:18:39,298;up at the sky
323;00:18:39,332;00:18:42,835;and paying no mind to where
323;00:18:39,332;00:18:42,835;his horse was taking him.
324;00:18:42,869;00:18:44,870;And now my son
324;00:18:42,869;00:18:44,870;is doing the same,
325;00:18:44,904;00:18:48,574;only this time he's riding
325;00:18:44,904;00:18:48,574;a lion instead of a horse.
326;00:18:48,609;00:18:51,177;Now...
327;00:18:51,245;00:18:53,580;I want you to tell me the truth
328;00:18:53,615;00:18:57,551;about this royal boy,
328;00:18:53,615;00:18:57,551;this Joffrey.
329;00:18:57,585;00:18:59,753;I... I...
330;00:18:59,788;00:19:01,222;You, you.
331;00:19:01,256;00:19:02,990;Who else would know better?
332;00:19:03,025;00:19:05,827;We've heard
332;00:19:03,025;00:19:05,827;some troubling tales.
333;00:19:05,861;00:19:08,596;Is there any truth to them?
334;00:19:08,630;00:19:11,032;Has this boy mistreated you?
335;00:19:11,066;00:19:13,401;Has he ripped out your tongue?
336;00:19:13,436;00:19:15,870;Joff-- King Joffrey,
337;00:19:15,904;00:19:19,140;he-- His Grace
337;00:19:15,904;00:19:19,140;is very fair
338;00:19:19,174;00:19:22,243;and handsome
338;00:19:19,174;00:19:22,243;and as brave as a lion.
339;00:19:22,277;00:19:24,879;Yes, all Lannisters are lions.
340;00:19:24,913;00:19:28,616;And when a Tyrell farts,
340;00:19:24,913;00:19:28,616;it smells like a rose.
341;00:19:28,650;00:19:30,918;But how kind is he?
341;00:19:28,650;00:19:30,918;How clever?
342;00:19:30,952;00:19:33,454;Has he a good heart,
342;00:19:30,952;00:19:33,454;a gentle hand?
343;00:19:33,488;00:19:34,922;I'm to be his wife.
344;00:19:34,956;00:19:37,157;I only want to know
344;00:19:34,956;00:19:37,157;what that means.
345;00:19:38,092;00:19:40,360;( footsteps approaching )
346;00:19:44,732;00:19:46,500;Bring me some cheese.
347;00:19:46,534;00:19:48,902;The cheese will be served
347;00:19:46,534;00:19:48,902;after the cakes, my lady.
348;00:19:48,969;00:19:51,237;The cheese will be served
348;00:19:48,969;00:19:51,237;when I want it served.
349;00:19:51,272;00:19:52,839;And I want it served now.
350;00:19:56,944;00:19:59,045;Are you frightened, child?
351;00:19:59,113;00:20:00,980;No need for that.
352;00:20:01,014;00:20:02,915;We're only women here.
353;00:20:02,950;00:20:06,252;Tell us the truth.
353;00:20:02,950;00:20:06,252;No harm will come to you.
354;00:20:07,321;00:20:10,289;My father always
354;00:20:07,321;00:20:10,289;told the truth.
355;00:20:10,324;00:20:12,391;Yes, he had that reputation.
356;00:20:12,426;00:20:14,860;And they named him traitor
356;00:20:12,426;00:20:14,860;and took his head.
357;00:20:14,895;00:20:17,797;Joffrey.
358;00:20:17,831;00:20:19,732;Joffrey did that.
359;00:20:19,767;00:20:23,136;He promised he would be merciful
359;00:20:19,767;00:20:23,136;and he cut my father's head off.
360;00:20:23,170;00:20:24,971;And he said that was mercy.
361;00:20:25,006;00:20:28,841;Then he took me up on the
361;00:20:25,006;00:20:28,841;walls and made me look at it.
362;00:20:32,479;00:20:34,881;Go on.
363;00:20:35,916;00:20:39,018;I-- I can't.
363;00:20:35,916;00:20:39,018;I never meant--
364;00:20:39,052;00:20:41,254;my father was a traitor.
365;00:20:41,288;00:20:43,723;My brother as well.
365;00:20:41,288;00:20:43,723;I have traitor's blood.
366;00:20:43,757;00:20:45,425;Please don't make me
366;00:20:43,757;00:20:45,425;say anymore.
367;00:20:45,459;00:20:46,959;She's terrified, Grandmother.
368;00:20:46,994;00:20:50,430;Just look at her.
368;00:20:46,994;00:20:50,430;Speak freely, child.
369;00:20:50,464;00:20:54,267;We would never betray your
369;00:20:50,464;00:20:54,267;confidence, I swear it.
370;00:20:56,503;00:20:59,138;He's a monster.
371;00:21:00,374;00:21:02,141;Ah.
372;00:21:02,176;00:21:04,110;That's a pity.
373;00:21:04,178;00:21:06,546;Please, don't stop the wedding.
374;00:21:06,580;00:21:09,248;Have no fear.
374;00:21:06,580;00:21:09,248;The Lord Oaf of Highgarden
375;00:21:09,282;00:21:12,117;is determined that

376;00:21:12,152;00:21:15,621;Even so, we thank you
376;00:21:12,152;00:21:15,621;for the truth.
377;00:21:15,655;00:21:18,457;Ah, here comes my cheese.

379;00:21:34,208;00:21:35,674;Karstark:
379;00:21:34,208;00:21:35,674;We're at war.
380;00:21:35,709;00:21:38,244;This march is a distraction.

381;00:21:38,278;00:21:41,447;is not a distraction.
382;00:21:41,481;00:21:44,450;Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
382;00:21:41,481;00:21:44,450;No.
383;00:21:44,484;00:21:46,518;Then it's a distraction.
384;00:21:46,553;00:21:49,621;My Uncle Edmure has his
384;00:21:46,553;00:21:49,621;forces garrisoned there.
385;00:21:49,656;00:21:51,523;We need his men.

387;00:21:53,893;00:21:55,861;to make a difference.
388;00:21:55,895;00:21:58,497;Have you lost faith
388;00:21:55,895;00:21:58,497;in our cause?
389;00:21:58,531;00:22:02,134;If it's revenge,
389;00:21:58,531;00:22:02,134;I still got faith in it.
390;00:22:02,168;00:22:04,035;If you no longer

392;00:22:06,739;00:22:10,342;Don't change the fact
392;00:22:06,739;00:22:10,342;that we've got half the men.

394;00:22:14,780;00:22:16,915;May I speak my mind,

414;00:23:32,058;00:23:35,828;I prayed for my son Bran

421;00:24:02,624;00:24:05,460;his coughing, his whimpering.
422;00:24:05,494;00:24:07,595;Which boy?
423;00:24:08,530;00:24:10,765;Jon Snow.
424;00:24:13,002;00:24:15,403;When my husband brought
424;00:24:13,002;00:24:15,403;that baby home from the war,
425;00:24:15,438;00:24:17,906;I couldn't bear to look at him.
426;00:24:19,075;00:24:20,375;I didn't want
426;00:24:19,075;00:24:20,375;to see those brown
427;00:24:20,410;00:24:23,679;stranger's eyes
427;00:24:20,410;00:24:23,679;staring up at me.
428;00:24:23,747;00:24:26,650;So I prayed to the gods,
428;00:24:23,747;00:24:26,650;take him away.
429;00:24:26,684;00:24:29,185;Make him die.
430;00:24:31,355;00:24:33,155;He got the pox.
431;00:24:35,826;00:24:40,230;And I knew I was the worst

432;00:24:42,132;00:24:44,267;A murderer.
433;00:24:45,670;00:24:48,538;I'd condemned this poor,
433;00:24:45,670;00:24:48,538;innocent child
434;00:24:48,572;00:24:51,007;to a horrible death
435;00:24:51,041;00:24:53,576;all because I was
435;00:24:51,041;00:24:53,576;jealous of his mother.
436;00:24:54,612;00:24:57,013;A woman he didn't even know.
437;00:24:57,048;00:25:00,217;So I prayed to all seven gods,
438;00:25:00,251;00:25:03,420;let the boy live.
439;00:25:03,454;00:25:05,889;Let him live
440;00:25:05,924;00:25:07,957;and I'll love him.
441;00:25:07,992;00:25:11,294;I'll be a mother to him.
442;00:25:11,329;00:25:15,065;I'll beg my husband

443;00:25:15,100;00:25:18,035;to call him Stark
443;00:25:15,100;00:25:18,035;and be done with it,
444;00:25:18,070;00:25:19,637;to make him one of us.
445;00:25:19,671;00:25:21,939;And he lived.
446;00:25:21,973;00:25:23,775;And he lived.
447;00:25:26,678;00:25:29,113;And I couldn't keep my promise.
448;00:25:33,552;00:25:36,187;And everything
448;00:25:33,552;00:25:36,187;that's happened since then...
449;00:25:37,990;00:25:40,992;all this horror

450;00:25:43,228;00:25:47,265;it's all because I couldn't
450;00:25:43,228;00:25:47,265;love a motherless child.
451;00:25:57,710;00:26:00,546;Was it hard for you
451;00:25:57,710;00:26:00,546;to kill the Halfhand?
452;00:26:02,683;00:26:04,317;Yes.

454;00:26:06,820;00:26:09,488;I like you, but if

455;00:26:09,523;00:26:11,457;for me to kill you.
456;00:26:11,492;00:26:13,226;I've got wildling

462;00:26:27,107;00:26:29,509;for one insult or another?

706;00:41:46,003;00:41:50,339;is no place for a lady.
707;00:41:50,374;00:41:52,775;And the bedside of a traitor?
708;00:41:55,245;00:41:57,846;Is that a place for a lady?
709;00:41:58,715;00:42:01,817;Your Grace,
710;00:42:01,851;00:42:04,787;I tried to do my duty
710;00:42:01,851;00:42:04,787;as a wife, that is all.
711;00:42:04,821;00:42:08,390;What was your duty to this
711;00:42:04,821;00:42:08,390;traitor as you saw it?
712;00:42:08,458;00:42:10,626;The duty of any wife
712;00:42:08,458;00:42:10,626;to any husband--
713;00:42:10,660;00:42:12,360;to provide him with children.
714;00:42:12,395;00:42:14,462;You failed to do this.
715;00:42:14,497;00:42:17,699;Why?
715;00:42:14,497;00:42:17,699;I--
716;00:42:19,902;00:42:22,703;I would not speak ill
716;00:42:19,902;00:42:22,703;of the dead, Your Grace.
717;00:42:22,737;00:42:24,671;You think one ought
717;00:42:22,737;00:42:24,671;to speak kindly
718;00:42:24,706;00:42:27,508;of a traitor merely because he's
718;00:42:24,706;00:42:27,508;had a sword put through his heart?
719;00:42:27,542;00:42:29,376;No.
720;00:42:29,411;00:42:32,246;I do beg your pardon.
721;00:42:32,280;00:42:35,549;The subtleties of politics
721;00:42:32,280;00:42:35,549;are often lost on me.
722;00:42:35,583;00:42:37,985;Renly...
723;00:42:39,754;00:42:42,489;I don't believe
723;00:42:39,754;00:42:42,489;he was interested
724;00:42:42,524;00:42:44,925;in the company of women.
725;00:42:46,561;00:42:48,395;What makes you say this?
726;00:42:49,798;00:42:53,668;Whenever I wanted
726;00:42:49,798;00:42:53,668;to make a child with him,
727;00:42:53,702;00:42:56,137;he--
728;00:42:56,172;00:42:58,206;he had so many excuses,
729;00:42:58,240;00:43:00,375;so many late-night
729;00:42:58,240;00:43:00,375;war councils.
730;00:43:00,409;00:43:02,744;He never wanted to try.
731;00:43:04,113;00:43:06,881;Except one evening,
732;00:43:06,915;00:43:09,717;after he'd had far too
732;00:43:06,915;00:43:09,717;much wine to drink,
733;00:43:09,752;00:43:12,220;he suggested something--
734;00:43:15,691;00:43:19,260;something that sounded
734;00:43:15,691;00:43:19,260;very painful
735;00:43:19,327;00:43:21,395;and couldn't possibly
735;00:43:19,327;00:43:21,395;result in children.
736;00:43:23,532;00:43:25,332;Maybe the fault was with me.
737;00:43:25,367;00:43:28,402;No, he was a known...
738;00:43:28,436;00:43:30,004;degenerate.
739;00:43:31,439;00:43:33,473;It's such a relief to hear
739;00:43:31,439;00:43:33,473;you say so, Your Grace.
740;00:43:33,507;00:43:35,208;Mmm.
741;00:43:35,242;00:43:37,944;I've considered
741;00:43:35,242;00:43:37,944;making his perversion
742;00:43:37,978;00:43:39,979;punishable by death.
743;00:43:41,081;00:43:44,149;As is your right.
744;00:43:44,184;00:43:47,753;You must do whatever
744;00:43:44,184;00:43:47,753;you need to do.
745;00:43:51,590;00:43:52,991;You are the king.
746;00:43:53,025;00:43:55,227;Yes.
747;00:43:57,964;00:43:59,665;I am.
748;00:44:05,806;00:44:07,273;Do you like it?
749;00:44:07,307;00:44:09,208;I just had it made.
750;00:44:09,243;00:44:12,011;Probably one of the finest
750;00:44:09,243;00:44:12,011;weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.
751;00:44:12,045;00:44:13,446;It's beautiful.
752;00:44:13,480;00:44:15,681;Will you show me how it works?
753;00:44:19,920;00:44:21,454;It's a new design.
754;00:44:21,489;00:44:23,923;Much easier to load.
754;00:44:21,489;00:44:23,923;There's no crank.
755;00:44:23,957;00:44:27,927;You use this lever
755;00:44:23,957;00:44:27,927;to draw the string.
756;00:44:33,366;00:44:35,535;The bolt goes here.
757;00:44:37,904;00:44:41,574;And then you just aim...
758;00:44:43,811;00:44:45,912;and...
759;00:44:47,047;00:44:49,649;( laughs )
760;00:44:49,683;00:44:53,419;Would you take me
760;00:44:49,683;00:44:53,419;hunting sometime?
761;00:44:53,453;00:44:55,387;Forgive me, Your Grace.
762;00:44:55,422;00:44:57,556;I know a hunt
762;00:44:55,422;00:44:57,556;is no place for a woman.
763;00:44:57,590;00:44:59,158;It's not unheard of.
764;00:44:59,192;00:45:01,494;My father would never
764;00:44:59,192;00:45:01,494;let me before--
765;00:45:01,528;00:45:03,929;You no longer belong to him.
766;00:45:04,964;00:45:06,899;Do you want to hold it?
767;00:45:06,933;00:45:09,001;May I?
767;00:45:06,933;00:45:09,001;Please.
768;00:45:16,644;00:45:18,979;I imagine it must be
768;00:45:16,644;00:45:18,979;so exciting
769;00:45:19,013;00:45:21,014;to squeeze your finger here
770;00:45:21,048;00:45:23,717;and watch something
770;00:45:21,048;00:45:23,717;die over there.
771;00:45:27,755;00:45:30,256;Could you do it?
772;00:45:30,290;00:45:32,291;Could you...
773;00:45:32,325;00:45:34,627;kill something?
774;00:45:36,096;00:45:38,297;I don't know, Your Grace.
774;00:45:36,096;00:45:38,297;Do you think I could?
775;00:45:38,332;00:45:40,666;Yes.
776;00:45:40,701;00:45:43,102;Would you like to watch me?
777;00:45:47,141;00:45:49,042;Yes.
778;00:45:50,611;00:45:53,313;( screams )
778;00:45:50,611;00:45:53,313;Stop! Stop!
779;00:45:53,347;00:45:55,716;Tell us the truth.
779;00:45:53,347;00:45:55,716;About what?
780;00:45:57,185;00:45:59,687;( screams ) I don't
780;00:45:57,185;00:45:59,687;know what you want.
781;00:45:59,721;00:46:01,955;I want the truth.
782;00:46:01,990;00:46:03,757;What truth?
783;00:46:03,792;00:46:05,759;Why'd you take Winterfell?
784;00:46:05,793;00:46:08,195;I took it to--
784;00:46:05,793;00:46:08,195;I took it--
785;00:46:08,229;00:46:09,630;Who gave the orders?
785;00:46:08,229;00:46:09,630;No one.
786;00:46:09,664;00:46:11,198;I took it on my own.
786;00:46:09,664;00:46:11,198;Why?
787;00:46:11,232;00:46:13,233;To take the North
787;00:46:11,232;00:46:13,233;while it was vulnerable.
788;00:46:13,268;00:46:15,002;What were you going
788;00:46:13,268;00:46:15,002;to do once you took it?
789;00:46:15,036;00:46:16,770;Hold it.
789;00:46:15,036;00:46:16,770;Rule it.
790;00:46:16,804;00:46:20,507;Good.
790;00:46:16,804;00:46:20,507;That's very good.
791;00:46:23,111;00:46:25,445;( screams )
792;00:46:25,479;00:46:27,180;Why did you do that?
792;00:46:25,479;00:46:27,180;I told you.
793;00:46:27,215;00:46:28,849;Why did you take Winterfell?
794;00:46:28,883;00:46:32,151;I took it to bring glory
794;00:46:28,883;00:46:32,151;to my house and my father.
795;00:46:39,927;00:46:41,928;Wait.
795;00:46:39,927;00:46:41,928;Wait, wait, wait.
796;00:46:41,963;00:46:45,398;I took it because
796;00:46:41,963;00:46:45,398;I hated the Starks.
797;00:46:45,433;00:46:47,801;I hated them
797;00:46:45,433;00:46:47,801;for holding me prisoner.
798;00:46:47,835;00:46:50,270;I wanted to hurt them.
799;00:46:56,076;00:46:58,144;What are you doing?
800;00:47:01,181;00:47:03,316;Please.
801;00:47:04,384;00:47:06,819;( screaming )
802;00:47:08,389;00:47:11,223;I'll tell you anything.
803;00:47:11,258;00:47:13,259;Just take it off.
804;00:47:13,293;00:47:16,395;Please.
804;00:47:13,293;00:47:16,395;Please, just take it off.
805;00:47:16,430;00:47:19,198;( door closes )
806;00:47:25,538;00:47:28,707;Your sister sent me.
806;00:47:25,538;00:47:28,707;Yara?
807;00:47:31,811;00:47:34,013;( whimpers )
808;00:47:35,816;00:47:38,318;I'll come for you tonight
808;00:47:35,816;00:47:38,318;when the castle sleeps.
809;00:47:38,352;00:47:40,387;No, don't go.
809;00:47:38,352;00:47:40,387;Please, please.
810;00:47:40,421;00:47:42,089;No, please don't leave me.
811;00:47:42,123;00:47:43,824;Please, please.
812;00:47:43,858;00:47:45,259;Please, please don't go!
813;00:47:45,293;00:47:49,998;( sobbing ) Please. Please.
813;00:47:45,293;00:47:49,998;Don't leave me.
814;00:47:50,032;00:47:52,700;Please don't go.
815;00:47:57,439;00:47:59,573;Rickon, stay with us.
816;00:48:00,908;00:48:04,344;It's all right.
816;00:48:00,908;00:48:04,344;The wolves will protect him.
817;00:48:13,688;00:48:15,623;You can get inside his head,
818;00:48:15,657;00:48:17,758;see through his eyes.
819;00:48:17,792;00:48:19,159;Only when I'm asleep.
820;00:48:19,194;00:48:21,729;That's how it begins until
820;00:48:19,194;00:48:21,729;you learn to control it.
821;00:48:21,763;00:48:23,130;You're a warg.
822;00:48:23,165;00:48:25,866;It's not just wolves.
823;00:48:25,901;00:48:27,701;Sometimes in my dreams
823;00:48:25,901;00:48:27,701;there's a--
824;00:48:27,736;00:48:30,471;A three-eyed raven?
824;00:48:27,736;00:48:30,471;You've seen it?
825;00:48:30,505;00:48:32,740;We saw him together.
825;00:48:30,505;00:48:32,740;You haven't forgotten?
826;00:48:32,774;00:48:35,476;Does it have anything
826;00:48:32,774;00:48:35,476;to do with warging?
827;00:48:35,510;00:48:38,245;No, the raven
827;00:48:35,510;00:48:38,245;is something different,
828;00:48:38,279;00:48:40,614;something deeper.
829;00:48:40,648;00:48:42,115;The raven brings the sight.
830;00:48:42,149;00:48:45,118;Seeing things
830;00:48:42,149;00:48:45,118;that haven't happened yet?
831;00:48:45,152;00:48:47,387;Or things that happened
831;00:48:45,152;00:48:47,387;long before you were born
832;00:48:47,421;00:48:51,124;or things that are happening right
832;00:48:47,421;00:48:51,124;now thousands of miles away.
833;00:48:51,159;00:48:53,493;What's he telling him?
834;00:48:53,528;00:48:55,729;Why don't you ask?
835;00:48:57,264;00:48:59,199;Isn't he ashamed, your brother,
836;00:48:59,233;00:49:00,934;needing you to protect him?
837;00:49:02,069;00:49:03,736;Where's the shame in that?
838;00:49:03,771;00:49:07,373;Any boy his age who needs
838;00:49:03,771;00:49:07,373;his sister to protect him
839;00:49:07,408;00:49:11,243;is gonna find himself
839;00:49:07,408;00:49:11,243;needing lots of protecting.
840;00:49:12,479;00:49:15,681;Some people
840;00:49:12,479;00:49:15,681;will always need help.
841;00:49:15,715;00:49:18,050;That doesn't mean
841;00:49:15,715;00:49:18,050;they're not worth helping.
842;00:49:22,389;00:49:25,725;When my father died,
842;00:49:22,389;00:49:25,725;I dreamt it.
843;00:49:25,759;00:49:29,095;You didn't dream it.
843;00:49:25,759;00:49:29,095;You saw it.
844;00:49:29,163;00:49:31,064;So did I.
845;00:49:31,098;00:49:32,699;You have the sight, too?
846;00:49:35,703;00:49:39,839;When I told my father
846;00:49:35,703;00:49:39,839;about your father...
847;00:49:41,275;00:49:44,410;for the first time
847;00:49:41,275;00:49:44,410;in my life, I saw him cry.
848;00:49:44,444;00:49:46,145;Your father is Howland Reed?
849;00:49:46,179;00:49:47,879;Yeah.
850;00:49:47,914;00:49:51,183;He saved my father's life
850;00:49:47,914;00:49:51,183;during the rebellion.
851;00:49:51,217;00:49:53,018;Your father told you
851;00:49:51,217;00:49:53,018;about the rebellion?
852;00:49:53,052;00:49:55,053;Mine never did.
853;00:49:55,088;00:49:56,922;But I saw that, too.
854;00:49:56,956;00:50:00,158;What else have you seen?
855;00:50:00,193;00:50:02,160;Only one thing
855;00:50:00,193;00:50:02,160;that matters--
856;00:50:02,195;00:50:04,296;you.

858;00:50:15,208;00:50:17,009;Thoros: I never liked
858;00:50:15,208;00:50:17,009;the skinny ones.
859;00:50:17,044;00:50:18,911;Like drinking from a puddle.
860;00:50:18,946;00:50:20,747;Not that I'm averse
860;00:50:18,946;00:50:20,747;to drinking from a puddle
861;00:50:20,781;00:50:22,082;every now and again,
861;00:50:20,781;00:50:22,082;you understand.
862;00:50:22,116;00:50:24,117;I don't drink ale.
863;00:50:24,152;00:50:26,854;There's no story so good
863;00:50:24,152;00:50:26,854;a drink won't make it better.
864;00:50:26,888;00:50:28,622;Yeah!
864;00:50:26,888;00:50:28,622;You see?
865;00:50:28,657;00:50:30,892;They've all suffered through
865;00:50:28,657;00:50:30,892;my bouts of sobriety.
866;00:50:30,926;00:50:33,227;It's very tedious
866;00:50:30,926;00:50:33,227;for all concerned.
867;00:50:33,261;00:50:35,729;Now, how did
867;00:50:33,261;00:50:35,729;three children--
868;00:50:35,764;00:50:37,298;We're not children.
869;00:50:37,332;00:50:40,067;How did three young persons
869;00:50:37,332;00:50:40,067;such as yourselves,
870;00:50:40,101;00:50:42,670;untrained in the art of war,

872;00:50:46,708;00:50:48,676;Gendry's a smith.
873;00:50:48,711;00:50:50,378;He was apprenticed
873;00:50:48,711;00:50:50,378;in the armory.
874;00:50:50,412;00:50:53,715;A smith, eh?
874;00:50:50,412;00:50:53,715;Where'd you train?
875;00:50:56,852;00:50:59,688;King's Landing.
875;00:50:56,852;00:50:59,688;Tobho Mott's shop.
876;00:50:59,722;00:51:01,857;That criminal.
876;00:50:59,722;00:51:01,857;He charges twice as much
877;00:51:01,891;00:51:03,358;as every other armorer
877;00:51:01,891;00:51:03,358;in the city.
878;00:51:03,393;00:51:05,027;That's because
878;00:51:03,393;00:51:05,027;he's twice as good.
879;00:51:05,094;00:51:08,430;Aha! A smith
879;00:51:05,094;00:51:08,430;and a salesman.
880;00:51:08,465;00:51:10,699;Gendry stole us weapons.
881;00:51:10,734;00:51:13,569;Ah, fought your way
881;00:51:10,734;00:51:13,569;out of Harrenhal, I see.
882;00:51:13,603;00:51:17,139;He knows how to use a
882;00:51:13,603;00:51:17,139;sword and so do I.
883;00:51:17,173;00:51:18,574;( men laugh )

886;00:51:24,147;00:51:27,316;Ooh!
887;00:51:32,455;00:51:35,457;( men cheer )
888;00:51:41,731;00:51:45,034;To your brothers!

889;00:51:51,341;00:51:53,909;You can finish
889;00:51:51,341;00:51:53,909;your meals before you go.
890;00:51:53,944;00:51:56,378;It may be awhile
890;00:51:53,944;00:51:56,378;before you see another.
891;00:51:56,413;00:51:59,448;You'll free us?
891;00:51:56,413;00:51:59,448;I gave you my word.
892;00:52:02,184;00:52:03,952;But before you go,
893;00:52:03,986;00:52:07,254;allow me to raise
893;00:52:03,986;00:52:07,254;a cup to your--
894;00:52:07,289;00:52:09,857;Hey, hey.

895;00:52:09,891;00:52:12,593;Now that is an uncommonly
895;00:52:09,891;00:52:12,593;large person.
896;00:52:12,628;00:52:14,162;How does one manage to subdue
897;00:52:14,196;00:52:15,963;such an uncommonly
897;00:52:14,196;00:52:15,963;large person?
898;00:52:15,997;00:52:18,699;One waits for him to drink
898;00:52:15,997;00:52:18,699;until he passes out.
899;00:52:18,734;00:52:21,535;Poor man.
899;00:52:18,734;00:52:21,535;You have my sympathy.
900;00:52:23,505;00:52:26,840;Aha, not a man at all.
901;00:52:27,976;00:52:30,944;A Hound!
901;00:52:27,976;00:52:30,944;( men howl and bark )
902;00:52:31,012;00:52:33,580;So good to see

904;00:52:35,617;00:52:38,018;The fuck you doing here?
905;00:52:38,052;00:52:39,953;Drinking and talking too much.
906;00:52:39,988;00:52:41,989;Same as ever.
906;00:52:39,988;00:52:41,989;( men laugh )
907;00:52:42,023;00:52:45,526;A pretty prize, lads.

910;00:52:52,768;00:52:55,237;are you doing
910;00:52:52,768;00:52:55,237;with the Stark bitch?
911;00:53:06,283;00:53:08,852;Jaime:
911;00:53:06,283;00:53:08,852;It's a tough decision--
912;00:53:08,886;00:53:10,887;take the bridge
912;00:53:08,886;00:53:10,887;and risk being seen
913;00:53:10,922;00:53:12,823;or cross the great water.
914;00:53:12,857;00:53:15,425;Silence, Kingslayer.
914;00:53:12,857;00:53:15,425;Anyone can see us on the bridge,
915;00:53:15,459;00:53:18,462;but cross by water
915;00:53:15,459;00:53:18,462;and the current could take us
916;00:53:18,496;00:53:20,463;or I could escape
916;00:53:18,496;00:53:20,463;down the river.
917;00:53:20,498;00:53:22,365;Good luck.
918;00:53:24,335;00:53:28,371;It's wonderful to watch you
918;00:53:24,335;00:53:28,371;wrestle with these dilemmas.

921;00:53:37,449;00:53:38,883;Wouldn't have guessed.
922;00:53:38,917;00:53:41,052;Be quick about it.

927;00:53:53,265;00:53:55,767;used to get corns.
928;00:53:55,801;00:53:58,135;Of course I used
928;00:53:55,801;00:53:58,135;to ride everywhere,
929;00:53:58,170;00:54:00,638;not march around
929;00:53:58,170;00:54:00,638;like a common foot soldier
930;00:54:00,672;00:54:02,906;wearing the same shit boots
930;00:54:00,672;00:54:02,906;for over a year.

938;00:54:42,646;00:54:44,947;for a great beast of a woman.

939;00:54:48,884;00:54:50,952;before you lunge.
940;00:54:50,986;00:54:53,487;It gives away the game.
941;00:55:07,035;00:55:09,337;Bit of a quandary for you.
