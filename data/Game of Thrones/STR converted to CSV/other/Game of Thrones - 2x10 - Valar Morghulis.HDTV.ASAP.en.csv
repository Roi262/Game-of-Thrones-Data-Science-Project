124;00:09:04,839;00:09:08,675;the Gods do indeed
124;00:09:04,839;00:09:08,675;hold betrothal solemn,
125;00:09:08,710;00:09:13,147;but your father,
125;00:09:08,710;00:09:13,147;blessed be his memory,
126;00:09:13,181;00:09:16,317;made this pact
126;00:09:13,181;00:09:16,317;before the Starks
127;00:09:16,351;00:09:19,987;revealed their falseness.
128;00:09:20,022;00:09:23,324;I have consulted
128;00:09:20,022;00:09:23,324;with the High Septon
129;00:09:23,358;00:09:27,629;and he assures me that their
129;00:09:23,358;00:09:27,629;crimes against the realm
130;00:09:27,663;00:09:31,499;free you from any promise
130;00:09:27,663;00:09:31,499;you have made to them
131;00:09:31,534;00:09:35,469;in the sight
131;00:09:31,534;00:09:35,469;of the Gods.
132;00:09:35,504;00:09:38,038;The Gods are good.
133;00:09:38,073;00:09:40,575;I am free
133;00:09:38,073;00:09:40,575;to heed my heart.
134;00:09:40,609;00:09:45,146;Ser Loras, I will gladly
134;00:09:40,609;00:09:45,146;wed your sweet sister.
135;00:09:45,180;00:09:46,947;You will be my Queen
136;00:09:46,982;00:09:50,550;and I will love you
136;00:09:46,982;00:09:50,550;from this day
137;00:09:50,585;00:09:52,652;until my last day.
138;00:10:15,145;00:10:18,080;My Lady.
139;00:10:18,114;00:10:20,949;My sincerest condolences.
140;00:10:20,984;00:10:23,418;They're right--
140;00:10:20,984;00:10:23,418;I'm not good enough for him.
141;00:10:23,452;00:10:25,153;You shouldn't say that.
142;00:10:25,187;00:10:27,655;You'll be good enough
142;00:10:25,187;00:10:27,655;for many things.
143;00:10:27,689;00:10:29,923;He'll still enjoy
143;00:10:27,689;00:10:29,923;beating you.
144;00:10:29,991;00:10:32,926;And now that
144;00:10:29,991;00:10:32,926;you're a woman,
145;00:10:32,960;00:10:36,063;he'll be able to enjoy you
145;00:10:32,960;00:10:36,063;in other ways as well.
146;00:10:36,097;00:10:39,066;But if he's not
146;00:10:36,097;00:10:39,066;marrying me--
147;00:10:39,101;00:10:42,370;He'll let you go home?
148;00:10:42,405;00:10:45,808;Joffrey's not the sort of boy
148;00:10:42,405;00:10:45,808;who gives away his toys.
149;00:10:46,810;00:10:48,744;You have a tender heart,
150;00:10:48,779;00:10:51,714;just like your mother
150;00:10:48,779;00:10:51,714;did at your age.
151;00:10:51,748;00:10:55,218;I can see so much
151;00:10:51,748;00:10:55,218;of her in you.
152;00:10:55,252;00:10:58,086;She was like
152;00:10:55,252;00:10:58,086;a sister to me.
153;00:10:58,121;00:11:00,989;For her sake,
154;00:11:01,024;00:11:04,192;I'll help get you home.
155;00:11:06,662;00:11:09,729;King's Landing
155;00:11:06,662;00:11:09,729;is my home now.
156;00:11:10,965;00:11:13,166;Look around you.
157;00:11:13,200;00:11:16,335;We're all liars here.
158;00:11:16,370;00:11:19,639;And every one of us
158;00:11:16,370;00:11:19,639;is better than you.
159;00:11:30,918;00:11:33,286;Come in.
160;00:11:33,320;00:11:35,588;Make yourself
160;00:11:33,320;00:11:35,588;comfortable.
161;00:11:41,994;00:11:45,062;That doesn't look
161;00:11:41,994;00:11:45,062;very comfortable.
162;00:11:45,097;00:11:48,098;Here, watch me.
163;00:11:52,003;00:11:53,970;No need for that,
163;00:11:52,003;00:11:53,970;my dear.
164;00:11:54,005;00:11:55,439;You sure?
165;00:11:55,473;00:11:57,441;Most men like
165;00:11:55,473;00:11:57,441;what they see.
166;00:11:57,475;00:11:59,110;I'm not like
166;00:11:57,475;00:11:59,110;most men.
167;00:11:59,144;00:12:01,612;That's what most men say.
168;00:12:01,647;00:12:05,116;If you don't want
168;00:12:01,647;00:12:05,116;what most men want,
169;00:12:05,151;00:12:07,820;then you'd better tell me
169;00:12:05,151;00:12:07,820;what you'd like me to do.
170;00:12:09,289;00:12:12,859;I would like you to tell me
170;00:12:09,289;00:12:12,859;if working for Lord Baelish
171;00:12:12,893;00:12:15,328;has been all you'd
171;00:12:12,893;00:12:15,328;hoped it would be.
172;00:12:16,597;00:12:18,064;Have we met?
173;00:12:18,098;00:12:20,800;You wouldn't
173;00:12:18,098;00:12:20,800;remember me if we had?
174;00:12:20,835;00:12:22,468;I meet a lot of men.
175;00:12:22,503;00:12:24,971;And I think you
175;00:12:22,503;00:12:24,971;remember all of them.
176;00:12:25,005;00:12:28,608;I think your true talents
176;00:12:25,005;00:12:28,608;are wasted on them.
177;00:12:28,642;00:12:31,411;You're very kind,
177;00:12:28,642;00:12:31,411;My Lord.
178;00:12:31,478;00:12:33,879;Allow me to return
178;00:12:31,478;00:12:33,879;the favor.
179;00:12:40,788;00:12:42,755;You're afraid.
180;00:12:42,789;00:12:45,591;Why?
180;00:12:42,789;00:12:45,591;Nothing dangerous down there.
181;00:12:45,626;00:12:48,027;I know who you are.
182;00:12:48,061;00:12:51,230;And, unlike your
182;00:12:48,061;00:12:51,230;current employer,
183;00:12:51,264;00:12:53,966;I protect those
183;00:12:51,264;00:12:53,966;who work for me.
184;00:12:54,001;00:12:57,070;I don't abuse them
184;00:12:54,001;00:12:57,070;to satisfy royal whims
185;00:12:57,104;00:12:59,672;or force them
185;00:12:57,104;00:12:59,672;to abuse each other.
186;00:12:59,707;00:13:01,441;How do you know
186;00:12:59,707;00:13:01,441;about that?
187;00:13:01,475;00:13:04,945;I thought you said
187;00:13:01,475;00:13:04,945;you knew who I was.
188;00:13:06,814;00:13:09,116;What can I do for you,
188;00:13:06,814;00:13:09,116;Lord Varys?
189;00:13:21,862;00:13:23,563;Littlefinger looks at you
190;00:13:23,597;00:13:26,032;and sees a collection
190;00:13:23,597;00:13:26,032;of profitable holes.
191;00:13:26,066;00:13:29,435;I see a potential
191;00:13:26,066;00:13:29,435;partner.
192;00:13:30,804;00:13:34,874;I'm afraid of him.
192;00:13:30,804;00:13:34,874;Oh, you should be.
193;00:13:34,908;00:13:37,577;He's a dangerous man.
194;00:13:37,611;00:13:40,880;But everyone has
194;00:13:37,611;00:13:40,880;their weaknesses.
195;00:13:40,914;00:13:45,085;Your current employer
195;00:13:40,914;00:13:45,085;hides his very well,
196;00:13:45,119;00:13:47,554;but not as well
196;00:13:45,119;00:13:47,554;as he thinks.
197;00:13:52,027;00:13:54,296;You're a virgin,
197;00:13:52,027;00:13:54,296;I take it?
198;00:13:54,330;00:13:56,397;Walk.
199;00:13:57,700;00:14:00,101;Childhood must have
199;00:13:57,700;00:14:00,101;been awful for you.
200;00:14:00,135;00:14:03,338;Were you a foot taller
200;00:14:00,135;00:14:03,338;than all the boys?
201;00:14:03,372;00:14:06,341;They laughed at you,
201;00:14:03,372;00:14:06,341;called you names?
202;00:14:06,376;00:14:08,644;Some boys
202;00:14:06,376;00:14:08,644;like a challenge.
203;00:14:08,678;00:14:12,115;One or two must have
203;00:14:08,678;00:14:12,115;tried to get inside big Brienne.
204;00:14:12,149;00:14:15,185;One or two tried.
204;00:14:12,149;00:14:15,185;Ah.
205;00:14:15,219;00:14:17,420;But you fought them off.
206;00:14:17,455;00:14:20,490;But maybe you wished one
206;00:14:17,455;00:14:20,490;of them could overpower you,
207;00:14:20,524;00:14:22,959;fling you down,
207;00:14:20,524;00:14:22,959;tear off your clothes.
208;00:14:22,994;00:14:25,395;But none of them
208;00:14:22,994;00:14:25,395;were strong enough.
209;00:14:25,430;00:14:27,698;I'm strong enough.
209;00:14:25,430;00:14:27,698;Not interested.
210;00:14:27,733;00:14:29,267;Of course you are.
211;00:14:29,301;00:14:32,003;You'd love to know what it
211;00:14:29,301;00:14:32,003;feels like to be a woman.
212;00:14:35,107;00:14:38,509;Ah. They lay
212;00:14:35,107;00:14:38,509;with lions.
213;00:14:38,543;00:14:40,210;Tavern girls, I'd say.
214;00:14:40,245;00:14:43,280;Probably served
214;00:14:40,245;00:14:43,280;my father's soldiers.
215;00:14:43,314;00:14:46,449;Maybe one of them
215;00:14:43,314;00:14:46,449;gave up a kiss and a feel.
216;00:14:46,483;00:14:48,984;That's how
216;00:14:46,483;00:14:48,984;they earned this.
217;00:14:49,019;00:14:52,888;The glorious work of the
217;00:14:49,019;00:14:52,888;northern freedom fighters.
218;00:14:52,922;00:14:55,157;Must make you proud
218;00:14:52,922;00:14:55,157;to serve the Starks.
219;00:14:55,192;00:14:59,162;I don't serve the Starks.
219;00:14:55,192;00:14:59,162;I serve Lady Catelyn.
220;00:14:59,196;00:15:02,098;Tell yourself that tonight
220;00:14:59,196;00:15:02,098;when they swing in your dreams.
221;00:15:06,705;00:15:08,873;What are you doing?
221;00:15:06,705;00:15:08,873;Burying them.
222;00:15:08,907;00:15:12,344;We shouldn't stay here.
222;00:15:08,907;00:15:12,344;We should get back on the river.
223;00:15:12,378;00:15:14,513;I think these women
223;00:15:12,378;00:15:14,513;would understand if--
224;00:15:14,581;00:15:16,014;I don't care
224;00:15:14,581;00:15:16,014;what you think.
225;00:15:16,048;00:15:17,415;I didn't leave it here.
226;00:15:17,450;00:15:19,551;Untie me now.
227;00:15:19,585;00:15:21,350;I gave it to you to cut
227;00:15:19,585;00:15:21,350;the rope, and now I don't
228;00:15:21,375;00:15:22,753;have me dagger no more.
229;00:15:22,754;00:15:25,256;So unless it got stuck in your ass
229;00:15:22,754;00:15:25,256;on its way to your cunt,
230;00:15:25,290;00:15:28,258;it stands to reason
230;00:15:25,290;00:15:28,258;that it's gone-- whoa!
231;00:15:29,660;00:15:31,394;What's your business here?
232;00:15:31,428;00:15:33,395;Traveling a prisoner.
233;00:15:35,933;00:15:39,202;You're a woman.
233;00:15:35,933;00:15:39,202;A woman!
234;00:15:39,237;00:15:41,305;Well, fuck me!
235;00:15:41,339;00:15:44,008;If you've quite
235;00:15:41,339;00:15:44,008;finished up--
236;00:15:46,045;00:15:47,912;All right,
236;00:15:46,045;00:15:47,912;we'll be going.
237;00:15:47,947;00:15:50,582;Whoa, whoa.
238;00:15:50,616;00:15:52,317;Who do you fight for?
239;00:15:52,351;00:15:54,819;The Starks.
240;00:15:56,555;00:15:59,023;What did he do?
241;00:15:59,057;00:16:02,159;Apparently eating is now a crime.
241;00:15:59,057;00:16:02,159;Who knew?
242;00:16:02,193;00:16:03,594;No, stealing is a crime.
243;00:16:03,628;00:16:06,063;But it's not a crime to starve.
243;00:16:03,628;00:16:06,063;That's justice for you.
244;00:16:06,097;00:16:08,265;Where are you taking him?
244;00:16:06,097;00:16:08,265;To Riverrun.
245;00:16:08,299;00:16:10,066;Why Riverrun?
246;00:16:10,100;00:16:12,835;Steal from the Tullys,
246;00:16:10,100;00:16:12,835;it's their dungeons you rot in.
247;00:16:12,870;00:16:15,337;Why not kill him?
247;00:16:12,870;00:16:15,337;For stealing a pig?
248;00:16:15,372;00:16:17,373;I don't give the orders.
249;00:16:17,407;00:16:18,941;He must be important
249;00:16:17,407;00:16:18,941;to someone.
250;00:16:18,975;00:16:22,144;Sending him with you?
250;00:16:18,975;00:16:22,144;How important could he be?
251;00:16:23,146;00:16:25,915;All right,
251;00:16:23,146;00:16:25,915;have it your way,
252;00:16:25,949;00:16:27,950;m'lady.
253;00:16:30,688;00:16:34,157;Do I know you?
253;00:16:30,688;00:16:34,157;Have you been to Ashemark?
254;00:16:34,192;00:16:36,326;No.
254;00:16:34,192;00:16:36,326;Then you don't know me.
255;00:16:36,361;00:16:39,496;Do you ever go to the river
255;00:16:36,361;00:16:39,496;market at Salt Rock?
256;00:16:39,531;00:16:42,066;Is it near Ashemark?
256;00:16:39,531;00:16:42,066;No.
257;00:16:42,100;00:16:43,501;I've never been there.
258;00:16:43,535;00:16:46,304;What do you think
258;00:16:43,535;00:16:46,304;of these beauties?
259;00:16:47,807;00:16:49,842;I hope you gave them
259;00:16:47,807;00:16:49,842;quick deaths.
260;00:16:49,876;00:16:52,812;Two of them we did, yeah.
261;00:16:54,648;00:16:57,216;Wait.
262;00:16:58,953;00:17:01,487;I do know you.
263;00:17:01,522;00:17:03,489;That's Jaime Lannister.
264;00:17:03,524;00:17:04,967;I wish someone had told me.
265;00:17:04,992;00:17:06,559;I wouldn't have had
265;00:17:04,992;00:17:06,559;to steal that pig.
266;00:17:06,560;00:17:08,895;If this is the Kingslayer,
266;00:17:06,560;00:17:08,895;I think I'd know about it.
267;00:17:08,930;00:17:10,731;How do you know what
267;00:17:08,930;00:17:10,731;the Kingslayer looks like?
268;00:17:10,765;00:17:12,967;I was at Whispering Wood.
268;00:17:10,765;00:17:12,967;I saw him.
269;00:17:13,001;00:17:15,870;They dragged him out of the woods
269;00:17:13,001;00:17:15,870;and threw him down before the King.
270;00:17:15,904;00:17:18,439;He's not the Kingslayer.
270;00:17:15,904;00:17:18,439;Sorry to disappoint you.
271;00:17:18,473;00:17:20,541;If he was, I'd only
271;00:17:18,473;00:17:20,541;be traveling his head.
272;00:17:20,575;00:17:22,710;I have a question
272;00:17:20,575;00:17:22,710;for you both.
273;00:17:22,744;00:17:25,112;And I want you to answer it
273;00:17:22,744;00:17:25,112;at the same time.
274;00:17:25,146;00:17:27,748;I count to three,
274;00:17:25,146;00:17:27,748;you both answer.
275;00:17:27,783;00:17:30,184;What's his name?
276;00:17:30,218;00:17:32,553;One.
277;00:17:32,587;00:17:35,389;Two. Three.
278;00:17:50,271;00:17:52,272;Two quick deaths.
279;00:18:19,998;00:18:22,266;Those were Stark men.
280;00:18:22,300;00:18:25,335;I don't serve the Starks.
281;00:18:25,370;00:18:27,270;I serve Lady Catelyn.
282;00:18:27,304;00:18:29,806;I told her I'd take you
282;00:18:27,304;00:18:29,806;to King's Landing,
283;00:18:29,840;00:18:31,774;and that's what
283;00:18:29,840;00:18:31,774;I'm going to do.
284;00:18:34,044;00:18:35,745;Stay.
285;00:18:53,267;00:18:56,402;Walder Frey is a dangerous
285;00:18:53,267;00:18:56,402;man to cross.
286;00:18:56,436;00:18:58,037;I know that.
287;00:18:58,071;00:19:00,239;And you mean
287;00:18:58,071;00:19:00,239;to do it anyway?
288;00:19:03,944;00:19:06,146;I love her.
289;00:19:06,180;00:19:08,548;I know that seems
289;00:19:06,180;00:19:08,548;important to you.
290;00:19:08,582;00:19:10,516;It is important to me.
291;00:19:12,319;00:19:15,754;Your father didn't love
291;00:19:12,319;00:19:15,754;me when we married.
292;00:19:15,789;00:19:19,024;He hardly knew me
292;00:19:15,789;00:19:19,024;or I him.
293;00:19:20,193;00:19:24,163;Love didn't just
293;00:19:20,193;00:19:24,163;happen to us.
294;00:19:24,198;00:19:26,834;We built it slowly
294;00:19:24,198;00:19:26,834;over the years,
295;00:19:26,868;00:19:28,903;stone by stone,
296;00:19:28,937;00:19:31,306;for you, for your
296;00:19:28,937;00:19:31,306;brothers and sisters,
297;00:19:31,340;00:19:33,908;for all of us.
298;00:19:33,942;00:19:37,978;It's not as exciting as
298;00:19:33,942;00:19:37,978;secret passion in the woods,
299;00:19:38,013;00:19:40,915;but it is stronger.
300;00:19:40,949;00:19:43,818;It lasts longer.
301;00:19:43,853;00:19:46,187;And that is what
301;00:19:43,853;00:19:46,187;would be in store for me
302;00:19:46,221;00:19:48,056;with one of
302;00:19:46,221;00:19:48,056;Walder Frey's daughters,
303;00:19:48,091;00:19:50,826;what you and father had?
303;00:19:48,091;00:19:50,826;Why not?
304;00:19:50,860;00:19:52,628;Because she's not beautiful?
305;00:19:52,662;00:19:54,664;Because she's not exotic
305;00:19:52,662;00:19:54,664;and exciting?
306;00:19:54,698;00:19:57,801;Now you're arguing just to argue
306;00:19:54,698;00:19:57,801;because you arranged it.
307;00:19:57,835;00:20:00,671;And you agreed to it.
308;00:20:00,705;00:20:02,573;You gave him your word.
309;00:20:02,607;00:20:07,479;Treat your oaths recklessly and
309;00:20:02,607;00:20:07,479;your people will do the same.
310;00:20:07,513;00:20:09,314;If your father lived
310;00:20:07,513;00:20:09,314;his life for one thing--
311;00:20:09,348;00:20:11,550;My father is dead.
312;00:20:11,584;00:20:13,491;And the only parent
312;00:20:11,584;00:20:13,491;I have left has no right
313;00:20:13,516;00:20:15,227;to call anyone reckless.
314;00:20:35,739;00:20:38,474;You said you saw
314;00:20:35,739;00:20:38,474;my victory in the flames.
315;00:20:38,508;00:20:40,542;I did.
316;00:20:40,577;00:20:43,212;I still see it.
316;00:20:40,577;00:20:43,212;The flames lied.
317;00:20:44,281;00:20:47,316;And I'm no better
317;00:20:44,281;00:20:47,316;than a savage
318;00:20:47,351;00:20:49,452;trusting in a Fire God.
319;00:20:51,521;00:20:54,523;I fought for your God
319;00:20:51,521;00:20:54,523;in Blackwater Bay.
320;00:20:54,557;00:20:57,859;I led my men to the gates
320;00:20:54,557;00:20:57,859;of the Seventh Hell
321;00:20:57,893;00:21:01,062;as their brothers burned
321;00:20:57,893;00:21:01,062;alive, and for what?
322;00:21:01,096;00:21:04,998;Attacked from behind by
322;00:21:01,096;00:21:04,998;Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells.
323;00:21:05,033;00:21:07,234;If you see so much in your flames,
323;00:21:05,033;00:21:07,234;why didn't you warn me?
324;00:21:07,268;00:21:09,169;The Lord of Light
324;00:21:07,268;00:21:09,169;only allows me glimpses.
325;00:21:09,203;00:21:11,504;You claimed to speak
325;00:21:09,203;00:21:11,504;for a God.
326;00:21:11,538;00:21:13,839;Will you quit the war just
326;00:21:11,538;00:21:13,839;because you've lost a battle?
327;00:21:13,873;00:21:15,775;You talk about war
327;00:21:13,873;00:21:15,775;as if you understand it.
328;00:21:15,809;00:21:18,010;I've been fighting
328;00:21:15,809;00:21:18,010;far longer than you.
329;00:21:18,045;00:21:21,148;Have you?
329;00:21:18,045;00:21:21,148;Show me how you fight.
330;00:21:25,087;00:21:27,789;Show me.
331;00:21:32,562;00:21:35,097;Where's your God now?
332;00:21:36,399;00:21:38,700;Will he save you?
333;00:21:38,734;00:21:41,536;Where is your God?
334;00:21:43,773;00:21:46,041;Inside you.
335;00:21:55,316;00:21:57,451;I murdered my brother.
336;00:22:05,762;00:22:08,297;We murdered him.
337;00:22:08,332;00:22:10,066;Share the weight
337;00:22:08,332;00:22:10,066;with me.
338;00:22:10,100;00:22:12,502;He wasn't your brother.
339;00:22:17,241;00:22:19,442;This war
339;00:22:17,241;00:22:19,442;has just begun.
340;00:22:19,477;00:22:21,777;It will last for years.
341;00:22:21,812;00:22:25,181;Thousands will die
341;00:22:21,812;00:22:25,181;at your command.
342;00:22:26,550;00:22:29,953;You will betray
342;00:22:26,550;00:22:29,953;the men serving you.
343;00:22:29,987;00:22:32,822;You will betray
343;00:22:29,987;00:22:32,822;your family.
344;00:22:32,856;00:22:36,425;You will betray everything
344;00:22:32,856;00:22:36,425;you once held dear.
345;00:22:37,861;00:22:40,795;And it will all
345;00:22:37,861;00:22:40,795;be worth it
346;00:22:40,830;00:22:43,899;because you are
346;00:22:40,830;00:22:43,899;the Son of Fire.
347;00:22:43,934;00:22:47,136;You are the Warrior
347;00:22:43,934;00:22:47,136;of Light.
348;00:22:49,005;00:22:52,874;You will sweep aside
348;00:22:49,005;00:22:52,874;this pretender and that one.
349;00:22:54,076;00:22:56,511;You will be King.
350;00:22:59,315;00:23:03,051;You promise
350;00:22:59,315;00:23:03,051;these things, but...
351;00:23:03,086;00:23:05,386;you don't know.
352;00:23:06,389;00:23:08,490;None of us know.
353;00:23:08,525;00:23:10,659;Let me show you.
354;00:23:19,836;00:23:21,736;Look into the fire,
354;00:23:19,836;00:23:21,736;my King.
355;00:23:21,771;00:23:24,105;Look.
356;00:23:25,340;00:23:26,973;I see fire.
357;00:23:27,008;00:23:29,142;Keep looking.
358;00:23:36,217;00:23:38,418;Do you see?
359;00:23:38,453;00:23:41,221;Do you see, my King?
360;00:24:00,174;00:24:02,275;Yes.
361;00:24:12,520;00:24:15,789;I will kill that man.
362;00:24:15,823;00:24:18,459;I don't care how many arrows
362;00:24:15,823;00:24:18,459;they feather me with,
363;00:24:18,493;00:24:20,861;how many spears
363;00:24:18,493;00:24:20,861;they run through me,
364;00:24:20,896;00:24:23,931;I will kill that horn-blowing
364;00:24:20,896;00:24:23,931;cunt before I fall.
365;00:24:23,966;00:24:26,768;They want you to know
365;00:24:23,966;00:24:26,768;you're surrounded.
366;00:24:26,802;00:24:28,803;I know I'm surrounded.
367;00:24:28,838;00:24:31,606;I know that because I stood
367;00:24:28,838;00:24:31,606;on the battlements
368;00:24:31,641;00:24:33,542;and saw I was surrounded.
369;00:24:33,576;00:24:35,310;They don't want
369;00:24:33,576;00:24:35,310;you to sleep.
370;00:24:35,344;00:24:37,246;They want to sap
370;00:24:35,344;00:24:37,246;your spirit before--
371;00:24:37,280;00:24:40,749;Thank you, wise bald man.
372;00:24:40,783;00:24:44,118;Thank you for explaining
372;00:24:40,783;00:24:44,118;siege tactics to me.
373;00:24:47,522;00:24:49,790;No word from my father?
374;00:24:51,626;00:24:53,326;No.
375;00:24:53,360;00:24:55,729;Send more ravens.
376;00:24:57,199;00:25:00,001;You killed
376;00:24:57,199;00:25:00,001;all the ravens.
377;00:25:02,605;00:25:05,274;The first time
377;00:25:02,605;00:25:05,274;I saw Winterfell...
378;00:25:10,748;00:25:14,251;The first time
378;00:25:10,748;00:25:14,251;I saw Winterfell,
379;00:25:14,285;00:25:16,196;it looked like something
379;00:25:14,285;00:25:16,196;that had been here for
380;00:25:16,221;00:25:18,221;thousands of years
381;00:25:18,723;00:25:20,857;and would be here
381;00:25:18,723;00:25:20,857;for thousands of years
382;00:25:20,891;00:25:23,125;after I was dead.
383;00:25:24,561;00:25:27,662;I saw it
383;00:25:24,561;00:25:27,662;and I thought,
384;00:25:27,696;00:25:30,331;of course Ned Stark
384;00:25:27,696;00:25:30,331;crushed our rebellion
385;00:25:30,366;00:25:33,101;and killed my brothers.
386;00:25:33,135;00:25:35,670;We never stood a chance against
386;00:25:33,135;00:25:35,670;a man who lives here.
387;00:25:35,704;00:25:38,407;Lord Stark went out of his way
387;00:25:35,704;00:25:38,407;to make it your home.
388;00:25:38,441;00:25:40,943;Yes, my captors were
388;00:25:38,441;00:25:40,943;so very kind to me.
389;00:25:40,977;00:25:43,345;You love
389;00:25:40,977;00:25:43,345;reminding me of that.
390;00:25:44,548;00:25:47,116;Everyone in this
390;00:25:44,548;00:25:47,116;frozen pile of shit
391;00:25:47,151;00:25:49,686;has always loved
391;00:25:47,151;00:25:49,686;reminding me of that.
392;00:25:52,190;00:25:54,559;You know what it's like
392;00:25:52,190;00:25:54,559;to be told how lucky you are
393;00:25:54,593;00:25:56,594;to be someone's prisoner?
394;00:25:58,597;00:26:01,399;To be told how much
394;00:25:58,597;00:26:01,399;you owe them?
395;00:26:03,835;00:26:07,037;And then to go back home
395;00:26:03,835;00:26:07,037;to your real father...
396;00:26:11,109;00:26:12,710;I will kill that man.
397;00:26:12,744;00:26:14,211;I swear it to
397;00:26:12,744;00:26:14,211;the Drowned God,
398;00:26:14,246;00:26:15,746;the Old Gods,
398;00:26:14,246;00:26:15,746;the New Gods,
399;00:26:15,781;00:26:17,952;to every fucking God
399;00:26:15,781;00:26:17,952;in every fucking heaven,
400;00:26:17,977;00:26:19,850;I will kill that man.
401;00:26:19,851;00:26:22,654;Theon, listen to me.
402;00:26:22,688;00:26:24,856;I serve Winterfell.
403;00:26:24,891;00:26:27,893;Now Winterfell is yours.
404;00:26:27,927;00:26:30,429;I'm bound by oath
404;00:26:27,927;00:26:30,429;to serve you.
405;00:26:30,463;00:26:33,232;And what's your counsel,
405;00:26:30,463;00:26:33,232;trusted friend?
406;00:26:33,267;00:26:35,535;Run.
407;00:26:35,569;00:26:38,097;500 Northmen wait
407;00:26:35,569;00:26:38,097;outside the walls.
408;00:26:38,122;00:26:39,972;You have 20 men.
409;00:26:39,973;00:26:41,907;You can't win.
410;00:26:41,942;00:26:44,109;Wait for nightfall
410;00:26:41,942;00:26:44,109;and run.
411;00:26:44,143;00:26:46,611;There's nowhere to run.
412;00:26:46,645;00:26:48,613;I'd never make it back
412;00:26:46,645;00:26:48,613;to the Iron Islands.
413;00:26:48,647;00:26:51,349;And even if I did,
413;00:26:48,647;00:26:51,349;even if by some miracle
414;00:26:51,383;00:26:54,218;I slipped through the lines
414;00:26:51,383;00:26:54,218;and made it home,
415;00:26:54,252;00:26:56,554;I'd be a coward.
416;00:26:56,589;00:26:59,324;The Greyjoy who ran.
417;00:27:00,726;00:27:03,194;The shame of the family.
418;00:27:04,863;00:27:06,631;Don't go home.
419;00:27:08,333;00:27:10,501;Join the Night's Watch.
420;00:27:12,437;00:27:14,605;Once a man
420;00:27:12,437;00:27:14,605;has taken the Black...
421;00:27:16,608;00:27:19,677;he's beyond reach
421;00:27:16,608;00:27:19,677;of the law.
422;00:27:19,711;00:27:22,813;All his past crimes
422;00:27:19,711;00:27:22,813;are forgiven.
423;00:27:24,850;00:27:26,884;I won't make it
423;00:27:24,850;00:27:26,884;to the Wall.
424;00:27:26,919;00:27:30,221;I won't make it 10 feet
424;00:27:26,919;00:27:30,221;past the Winterfell gates.
425;00:27:30,255;00:27:32,423;There are ways.
426;00:27:32,457;00:27:35,292;Hidden passageways built
426;00:27:32,457;00:27:35,292;so the Lords of Winterfell
427;00:27:35,326;00:27:37,695;could escape.
428;00:27:37,729;00:27:40,397;The road will be dangerous.
429;00:27:42,334;00:27:44,602;But with a little luck...
430;00:27:47,606;00:27:52,176;the Night's Watch is an ancient,
430;00:27:47,606;00:27:52,176;honorable order.
431;00:27:53,545;00:27:55,880;You'll have
431;00:27:53,545;00:27:55,880;opportunities there.
432;00:27:57,350;00:28:01,686;The opportunity for Jon Snow
432;00:27:57,350;00:28:01,686;to cut my throat in my sleep.
433;00:28:01,720;00:28:05,757;The opportunity to make
433;00:28:01,720;00:28:05,757;amends for what you've done.
434;00:28:07,727;00:28:10,262;I've done a lot,
434;00:28:07,727;00:28:10,262;haven't I?
435;00:28:11,463;00:28:14,165;Things I never
435;00:28:11,463;00:28:14,165;imagined myself doing.
436;00:28:16,401;00:28:20,471;I've known you many years,
436;00:28:16,401;00:28:20,471;Theon Greyjoy.
437;00:28:22,307;00:28:26,211;You're not the man
437;00:28:22,307;00:28:26,211;you're pretending to be.
438;00:28:28,080;00:28:29,981;Not yet.
439;00:28:33,418;00:28:35,586;You may be right.
440;00:28:37,956;00:28:41,325;But I've gone too far
440;00:28:37,956;00:28:41,325;to pretend to be anything else.
441;00:28:50,903;00:28:53,871;You hear that?
442;00:28:53,905;00:28:57,040;That's the mating call
442;00:28:53,905;00:28:57,040;of the Northmen.
443;00:28:57,074;00:28:59,943;They want to fuck us.
444;00:28:59,977;00:29:02,178;Well, I haven't had
444;00:28:59,977;00:29:02,178;a good fuck in weeks.
445;00:29:02,213;00:29:04,814;I'm ready for one.
446;00:29:04,848;00:29:08,452;They say every Ironborn man is
446;00:29:04,848;00:29:08,452;worth a dozen from the mainland.
447;00:29:08,486;00:29:10,353;Aye!
448;00:29:10,388;00:29:14,391;You think they're right?
448;00:29:10,388;00:29:14,391;Aye.
449;00:29:14,425;00:29:18,228;We die today, brothers.
450;00:29:18,262;00:29:21,397;We die bleeding
450;00:29:18,262;00:29:21,397;from 100 wounds
451;00:29:21,432;00:29:26,235;with arrows in our necks
451;00:29:21,432;00:29:26,235;and spears in our guts,
452;00:29:26,270;00:29:30,106;but our war cries will echo
452;00:29:26,270;00:29:30,106;through eternity.
453;00:29:30,140;00:29:33,109;They will sing about
453;00:29:30,140;00:29:33,109;the battle of Winterfell
454;00:29:33,143;00:29:36,045;until the Iron Islands have
454;00:29:33,143;00:29:36,045;slipped beneath the waves.
455;00:29:36,079;00:29:40,049;Every man, woman, and child
455;00:29:36,079;00:29:40,049;will know who we were
456;00:29:40,083;00:29:42,818;and how long we stood.
457;00:29:42,853;00:29:44,687;"Aggar and Gelmarr;"
458;00:29:44,721;00:29:46,222;"Wex and Urzen;"
459;00:29:46,256;00:29:48,357;Stygg and Black Lorren--
460;00:29:48,392;00:29:51,660;Ironborn warriors
460;00:29:48,392;00:29:51,660;will cry out our names
461;00:29:51,695;00:29:54,997;as they leap onto the shores
461;00:29:51,695;00:29:54,997;of Seagard and Faircastle.
462;00:29:55,031;00:29:56,465;Aye!
463;00:29:56,499;00:29:59,134;Mothers will name their sons for us.
463;00:29:56,499;00:29:59,134;Aye!
464;00:29:59,168;00:30:01,836;Girls will think of us
464;00:29:59,168;00:30:01,836;with their lovers inside them.
465;00:30:01,871;00:30:03,404;Aye!
466;00:30:03,439;00:30:05,507;And whoever kills
466;00:30:03,439;00:30:05,507;that fucking horn-blower
467;00:30:05,541;00:30:08,610;will stand in bronze
467;00:30:05,541;00:30:08,610;above the shores of Pyke!
468;00:30:08,644;00:30:10,144;Aye!
469;00:30:10,178;00:30:13,013;What is dead may never die!
469;00:30:10,178;00:30:13,013;What is dead may never die!
470;00:30:13,048;00:30:15,482;Ah!
471;00:30:18,052;00:30:19,787;Thought he'd never shut up.
472;00:30:19,821;00:30:22,222;It was a good speech.
473;00:30:22,257;00:30:23,957;Didn't want to interrupt.
474;00:30:27,161;00:30:29,229;What is this?
475;00:30:29,263;00:30:31,064;What are you doing?
476;00:30:37,004;00:30:39,072;Let's go home.
477;00:30:41,209;00:30:43,411;Come on.
478;00:30:52,221;00:30:53,689;Why should I believe you?
479;00:30:53,723;00:30:55,290;Why would I lie
479;00:30:53,723;00:30:55,290;about it?
480;00:30:55,324;00:30:58,059;To create strife between
480;00:30:55,324;00:30:58,059;my sister and me.
481;00:30:58,094;00:31:00,863;Where before there was
481;00:30:58,094;00:31:00,863;nothing but love.
482;00:31:00,897;00:31:05,333;Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill
482;00:31:00,897;00:31:05,333;you on your sister's orders.
483;00:31:05,368;00:31:07,869;If it weren't for your
483;00:31:05,368;00:31:07,869;Squire's bravery,
484;00:31:07,903;00:31:10,538;you'd be a dead man.
485;00:31:10,572;00:31:14,308;Pod.
485;00:31:10,572;00:31:14,308;Yes, My Lord?
486;00:31:14,343;00:31:16,979;Would it be
486;00:31:14,343;00:31:16,979;excessive of me
487;00:31:17,013;00:31:19,682;to ask you to save
487;00:31:17,013;00:31:19,682;my life twice in a week?
488;00:31:19,716;00:31:21,951;No, My Lord.
489;00:31:21,985;00:31:24,454;You're a good lad.
490;00:31:24,488;00:31:27,290;Get Bronn, tell him I want
490;00:31:24,488;00:31:27,290;four of his most loyal
491;00:31:27,325;00:31:29,260;Gold Cloaks outside
491;00:31:27,325;00:31:29,260;my door at all times.
492;00:31:29,294;00:31:31,629;I'm afraid your friend
492;00:31:29,294;00:31:31,629;has been relieved
493;00:31:31,663;00:31:33,898;of his command
493;00:31:31,663;00:31:33,898;of the City Watch.
494;00:31:33,933;00:31:37,602;The Gold Cloaks are now firmly
494;00:31:33,933;00:31:37,602;in the hands of your father
495;00:31:37,636;00:31:39,370;or your sister.
496;00:31:39,404;00:31:42,207;It varies
496;00:31:39,404;00:31:42,207;from cloak to cloak.
497;00:31:42,241;00:31:45,210;Then my hill tribesmen.
497;00:31:42,241;00:31:45,210;Have gone home.
498;00:31:45,244;00:31:48,480;Your father paid them
498;00:31:45,244;00:31:48,480;quite handsomely.
499;00:31:51,517;00:31:54,453;I'm afraid we won't
499;00:31:51,517;00:31:54,453;be seeing each other
500;00:31:54,487;00:31:56,555;for some time, My Lord.
501;00:31:56,589;00:32:00,326;Don't want to swim too close
501;00:31:56,589;00:32:00,326;to a drowning man?
502;00:32:01,394;00:32:03,595;And I thought
502;00:32:01,394;00:32:03,595;we were friends.
503;00:32:03,629;00:32:06,565;We are.
504;00:32:06,599;00:32:08,533;Podrick, would you mind?
505;00:32:24,083;00:32:26,417;There are many who know
505;00:32:24,083;00:32:26,417;that without you
506;00:32:26,451;00:32:30,088;this city faced
506;00:32:26,451;00:32:30,088;certain defeat.
507;00:32:30,122;00:32:32,290;The King won't give
507;00:32:30,122;00:32:32,290;you any honors,
508;00:32:32,324;00:32:34,826;the histories
508;00:32:32,324;00:32:34,826;won't mention you,
509;00:32:34,860;00:32:38,062;but we will not forget.
510;00:32:40,533;00:32:42,133;Come along now, Podrick.
511;00:32:46,540;00:32:48,675;My love.
512;00:32:48,709;00:32:50,309;It was good of you
512;00:32:48,709;00:32:50,309;to come.
513;00:32:50,344;00:32:51,945;Good of me?
514;00:32:51,979;00:32:54,014;Of course I come.
515;00:32:58,052;00:33:00,720;I want to see you.
515;00:32:58,052;00:33:00,720;Believe me, you don't.
516;00:33:01,822;00:33:03,690;Have you looked?
517;00:33:04,892;00:33:06,625;I will be the first.
518;00:33:30,686;00:33:32,353;Well?
519;00:33:32,388;00:33:35,357;You are a mess.
520;00:33:37,093;00:33:39,761;I'm a monster
520;00:33:37,093;00:33:39,761;as well as a dwarf.
521;00:33:39,795;00:33:41,296;You should charge
521;00:33:39,795;00:33:41,296;me double.
522;00:33:41,330;00:33:43,064;You think I'm here
522;00:33:41,330;00:33:43,064;for money?
523;00:33:43,098;00:33:45,033;That was the arrangement
523;00:33:43,098;00:33:45,033;we made.
524;00:33:45,067;00:33:48,102;I pay you
524;00:33:45,067;00:33:48,102;and you lie to me.
525;00:33:48,136;00:33:50,671;Aw, I'm a poor
525;00:33:48,136;00:33:50,671;little rich man
526;00:33:50,706;00:33:52,646;and nobody loves me,
526;00:33:50,706;00:33:52,646;so I make jokes all the time
527;00:33:52,671;00:33:54,225;and pay them to laugh.
528;00:33:54,776;00:33:56,543;Fuck your money.
529;00:33:57,512;00:33:58,612;Let's leave.
530;00:33:58,647;00:34:00,614;Leave?
530;00:33:58,647;00:34:00,614;Leave King's Landing.
531;00:34:00,649;00:34:03,184;They tried to kill you.
531;00:34:00,649;00:34:03,184;They will try again.
532;00:34:03,218;00:34:05,453;Going into wars,
532;00:34:03,218;00:34:05,453;fighting soldiers--
533;00:34:05,488;00:34:07,089;you're terrible at this.
534;00:34:08,691;00:34:11,260;Let's take a boat to Pentos
534;00:34:08,691;00:34:11,260;and never come back.
535;00:34:11,294;00:34:12,895;You don't belong here.
536;00:34:12,930;00:34:14,698;What would we do
536;00:34:12,930;00:34:14,698;in Pentos?
537;00:34:14,732;00:34:17,467;Eat, drink,
538;00:34:17,502;00:34:19,769;fuck, live.
539;00:34:23,842;00:34:26,077;I want to go with you.
540;00:34:26,111;00:34:27,678;So do it.
541;00:34:27,713;00:34:29,947;Your father, your sister,
541;00:34:27,713;00:34:29,947;all these bad people,
542;00:34:29,982;00:34:31,749;they can't stop you.
543;00:34:31,784;00:34:34,218;Forget about them.
543;00:34:31,784;00:34:34,218;Come with me.
544;00:34:36,722;00:34:38,422;I can't.
545;00:34:38,457;00:34:41,291;I do belong here.
546;00:34:42,227;00:34:44,462;These bad people
547;00:34:44,496;00:34:46,130;are what I'm good at.
548;00:34:46,164;00:34:48,566;Outtalking them,
548;00:34:46,164;00:34:48,566;outthinking them.
549;00:34:48,600;00:34:50,902;It's what I am.
550;00:34:52,304;00:34:55,140;And I like it.
551;00:34:55,174;00:34:58,576;I like it more than
551;00:34:55,174;00:34:58,576;anything I've ever done.
552;00:35:03,416;00:35:05,517;Are you going to leave?
553;00:35:11,457;00:35:13,625;You have a shit memory.
554;00:35:16,195;00:35:18,696;I am yours
554;00:35:16,195;00:35:18,696;and you are mine.
555;00:35:30,942;00:35:33,544;In the sight
555;00:35:30,942;00:35:33,544;of the Seven,
556;00:35:33,578;00:35:37,615;I hereby seal
556;00:35:33,578;00:35:37,615;these two souls,
557;00:35:37,649;00:35:42,420;binding them as one
557;00:35:37,649;00:35:42,420;for eternity.
558;00:35:45,790;00:35:50,594;Look upon one another
558;00:35:45,790;00:35:50,594;and say the words.

561;00:35:58,268;00:36:01,804;stranger...
562;00:36:01,838;00:36:04,540;I am hers and she is mine...
562;00:36:01,838;00:36:04,540;I am his and he is mine...
563;00:36:04,574;00:36:08,077;from this day
563;00:36:04,574;00:36:08,077;until the end of my days.
564;00:37:16,684;00:37:18,885;Is this a riddle?
565;00:37:58,725;00:38:01,193;Khaleesi!
566;00:38:02,162;00:38:04,029;Khaleesi!
567;00:38:06,633;00:38:09,001;Khaleesi!
568;00:38:11,771;00:38:14,906;Are you trying to frighten me
568;00:38:11,771;00:38:14,906;with magic tricks?
569;00:38:14,940;00:38:17,642;You want me?
569;00:38:14,940;00:38:17,642;Here I am.
570;00:38:17,677;00:38:19,745;Are you afraid
570;00:38:17,677;00:38:19,745;of a little girl?
571;00:38:44,203;00:38:46,504;How did he find us?
572;00:39:10,563;00:39:12,564;What are you doing here?
573;00:39:12,598;00:39:14,266;Waiting for you.
574;00:39:14,300;00:39:16,969;How did you know
574;00:39:14,300;00:39:16,969;we'd come this way?
575;00:39:17,003;00:39:18,871;After all the things
575;00:39:17,003;00:39:18,871;you have seen,
576;00:39:18,905;00:39:20,906;this is your question?
577;00:39:20,940;00:39:23,576;How did you
577;00:39:20,940;00:39:23,576;kill those guards?
578;00:39:23,610;00:39:25,978;Was it hard?
579;00:39:26,012;00:39:28,747;No harder than taking a new name
579;00:39:26,012;00:39:28,747;if you know the way.
580;00:39:28,782;00:39:32,418;Show me how. I want
580;00:39:28,782;00:39:32,418;to be able to do it, too.
581;00:39:32,452;00:39:34,620;If you would learn,
581;00:39:32,452;00:39:34,620;you must come with me.
582;00:39:34,655;00:39:36,221;Where?
583;00:39:36,256;00:39:39,458;Far and away across
583;00:39:36,256;00:39:39,458;the Narrow Sea to Braavos.
584;00:39:39,492;00:39:41,560;My dancing master
584;00:39:39,492;00:39:41,560;was from Braavos.
585;00:39:43,062;00:39:44,830;To be a dancing master
585;00:39:43,062;00:39:44,830;is a special thing,
586;00:39:44,865;00:39:47,466;but to be a faceless man--
587;00:39:47,500;00:39:49,435;that is something
587;00:39:47,500;00:39:49,435;else entirely.
588;00:39:49,469;00:39:52,672;A girl has many names
588;00:39:49,469;00:39:52,672;on her lips--
589;00:39:52,706;00:39:55,975;Joffrey, Cersei,

591;00:39:57,878;00:40:01,314;Names to offer up
591;00:39:57,878;00:40:01,314;to the Red God.
592;00:40:01,348;00:40:05,150;She could offer them all
592;00:40:01,348;00:40:05,150;one by one.
593;00:40:07,287;00:40:09,421;I want to.
594;00:40:11,690;00:40:14,358;But I can't.
595;00:40:14,393;00:40:17,495;I need to find
595;00:40:14,393;00:40:17,495;my brother and mother.
596;00:40:18,397;00:40:20,131;And my sister.
597;00:40:21,700;00:40:23,801;I need to find
597;00:40:21,700;00:40:23,801;her, too.
598;00:40:25,371;00:40:27,271;Then we must part.
599;00:40:27,306;00:40:29,507;A man has duties as well.
600;00:40:29,541;00:40:30,976;Here.
601;00:40:31,010;00:40:32,977;What is it?
602;00:40:33,012;00:40:36,014;A coin of great value.
603;00:40:36,048;00:40:38,483;Could it buy a horse?
604;00:40:38,518;00:40:41,453;It is not meant
604;00:40:38,518;00:40:41,453;for the buying of horses.
605;00:40:41,487;00:40:42,988;Then what good is it?
606;00:40:43,022;00:40:45,857;If the day comes when
606;00:40:43,022;00:40:45,857;you must find me again,
607;00:40:45,892;00:40:47,960;just give that coin
607;00:40:45,892;00:40:47,960;to any man from Braavos
608;00:40:47,994;00:40:49,728;and say these words to him,
609;00:40:49,762;00:40:51,764;Valar Morghulis.
610;00:40:51,798;00:40:54,333;Valar Morghulis.
611;00:40:58,105;00:41:00,305;Please don't go, Jaqen.
612;00:41:03,476;00:41:05,678;Jaqen is dead.
613;00:41:05,712;00:41:08,681;Say it again.
613;00:41:05,712;00:41:08,681;Valar Morghulis.
614;00:41:08,715;00:41:12,018;Valar Morghulis.
615;00:41:12,052;00:41:14,020;Good.
616;00:41:20,761;00:41:23,229;Farewell, Arya Stark.
617;00:41:47,388;00:41:50,490;Osha, what are you doing?
618;00:43:13,973;00:43:16,642;Tell us what medicine
618;00:43:13,973;00:43:16,642;to get from your chambers.
619;00:43:16,676;00:43:19,412;We'll make you better.
619;00:43:16,676;00:43:19,412;I feel just fine.
620;00:43:22,783;00:43:26,252;They burned it down.
620;00:43:22,783;00:43:26,252;They burned everything.
621;00:43:26,287;00:43:29,856;Not everything.
621;00:43:26,287;00:43:29,856;Not you.
622;00:43:32,493;00:43:34,594;But they may come back.
622;00:43:32,493;00:43:34,594;You have to go.
623;00:43:34,628;00:43:36,496;Put on your
623;00:43:34,628;00:43:36,496;warmest clothes.
624;00:43:36,530;00:43:38,965;Pack as much food as you
624;00:43:36,530;00:43:38,965;can carry and go north.
625;00:43:39,000;00:43:40,834;North's the wrong way.
626;00:43:40,868;00:43:42,969;Their mother and brother
626;00:43:40,868;00:43:42,969;are south.
627;00:43:43,003;00:43:44,804;We don't know where.
628;00:43:44,838;00:43:47,640;There are too many enemies
628;00:43:44,838;00:43:47,640;in the South.
629;00:43:47,675;00:43:49,643;Go to the Wall
629;00:43:47,675;00:43:49,643;to Jon.
630;00:43:49,677;00:43:52,545;He'll look after you and let your
630;00:43:49,677;00:43:52,545;mother know you're safe.
631;00:43:52,580;00:43:55,516;I don't want to leave you.
632;00:43:55,551;00:43:58,286;No more than I want
632;00:43:55,551;00:43:58,286;to leave you.
633;00:43:58,320;00:44:02,023;I pulled you
633;00:43:58,320;00:44:02,023;into the world.
634;00:44:02,057;00:44:03,591;Both of you.
635;00:44:03,626;00:44:07,063;I've seen both your faces
635;00:44:03,626;00:44:07,063;almost every day since.
636;00:44:07,097;00:44:12,268;And for that, I consider
636;00:44:07,097;00:44:12,268;myself very, very lucky.
637;00:44:13,638;00:44:15,104;Go now with Hodor.
638;00:44:15,139;00:44:17,206;Go on.
639;00:44:17,241;00:44:19,342;I'll be right here.
640;00:44:21,445;00:44:23,579;Hodor.
641;00:44:26,182;00:44:28,817;Osha.
642;00:44:28,852;00:44:30,852;You must protect them.
643;00:44:30,887;00:44:33,588;You're the only one
643;00:44:30,887;00:44:33,588;who can.
644;00:44:35,658;00:44:38,993;You may have to protect
644;00:44:35,658;00:44:38,993;them against your own kind.
645;00:44:39,027;00:44:41,896;I've got no great love
645;00:44:39,027;00:44:41,896;for my own kind.
646;00:44:44,399;00:44:46,833;I'll get you milk
646;00:44:44,399;00:44:46,833;of the poppy.
