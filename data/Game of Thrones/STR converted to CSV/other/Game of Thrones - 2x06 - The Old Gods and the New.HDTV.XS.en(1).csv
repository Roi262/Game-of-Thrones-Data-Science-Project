124;00:08:15,777;00:08:17,878;What have they
124;00:08:15,777;00:08:17,878;done to him?
125;00:08:17,912;00:08:20,981;We caught this one on this way
125;00:08:17,912;00:08:20,981;back from Torrhen's Square.
126;00:08:21,015;00:08:23,950;Took out two of ours
126;00:08:21,015;00:08:23,950;before I got his sword.
127;00:08:23,984;00:08:27,420;Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that
127;00:08:23,984;00:08:27,420;we meet as foes.
128;00:08:27,454;00:08:31,291;It grieves me you've less honor
128;00:08:27,454;00:08:31,291;than a back alley whore.
129;00:08:31,325;00:08:34,794;You were raised here
129;00:08:31,325;00:08:34,794;under this roof.
130;00:08:34,828;00:08:37,497;These people are your people.
130;00:08:34,828;00:08:37,497;They are not my people.
131;00:08:37,532;00:08:39,733;King Robb thought of you
131;00:08:37,532;00:08:39,733;as a brother.
132;00:08:39,768;00:08:42,703;My brothers are dead.
133;00:08:42,737;00:08:45,506;They died fighting
133;00:08:42,737;00:08:45,506;Stark men, men like you.
134;00:08:45,540;00:08:48,976;Aye, they died fighting
134;00:08:45,540;00:08:48,976;a war your father started.
135;00:08:49,010;00:08:51,245;Lord Stark raised you
135;00:08:49,010;00:08:51,245;among his own sons.
136;00:08:51,279;00:08:53,413;Among them,
136;00:08:51,279;00:08:53,413;but not one of them.
137;00:08:53,447;00:08:56,249;I was his hostage
137;00:08:53,447;00:08:56,249;taken from my home.
138;00:08:56,283;00:08:57,984;If he were alive
138;00:08:56,283;00:08:57,984;to see this--
139;00:08:58,018;00:08:59,853;He's not.
139;00:08:58,018;00:08:59,853;He's dead.
140;00:08:59,887;00:09:01,955;The Seven Kingdoms
140;00:08:59,887;00:09:01,955;are at war.
141;00:09:01,989;00:09:04,257;And Winterfell is mine.
142;00:09:04,292;00:09:06,960;I should have put
142;00:09:04,292;00:09:06,960;a sword in your belly
143;00:09:06,994;00:09:08,528;instead of
143;00:09:06,994;00:09:08,528;in your hand.
144;00:09:08,562;00:09:11,664;You've served this House
144;00:09:08,562;00:09:11,664;faithfully, old man.
145;00:09:11,699;00:09:13,767;But keep talking
145;00:09:11,699;00:09:13,767;and I'll--
146;00:09:15,636;00:09:18,605;Take him to the cells.
146;00:09:15,636;00:09:18,605;Lock him up--
147;00:09:18,640;00:09:20,341;My prince,
148;00:09:20,375;00:09:22,943;you cannot let that stand.
148;00:09:20,375;00:09:22,943;He must pay.
149;00:09:22,978;00:09:24,878;I'll lock him in a cell
149;00:09:22,978;00:09:24,878;until he rots--
150;00:09:24,913;00:09:27,915;No, he has to pay
150;00:09:24,913;00:09:27,915;the iron price.
151;00:09:27,949;00:09:31,052;They'll never respect
151;00:09:27,949;00:09:31,052;you while he lives.
152;00:09:49,407;00:09:51,575;Ser Rodrik,
153;00:09:51,610;00:09:53,043;I sentence you to death.
154;00:09:53,078;00:09:55,545;No! You said no harm
154;00:09:53,078;00:09:55,545;would come to them if I yielded.
155;00:09:55,580;00:09:57,948;The old man couldn't
155;00:09:55,580;00:09:57,948;keep his mouth shut.
156;00:09:57,982;00:10:00,650;I urge you not to make
156;00:09:57,982;00:10:00,650;a hasty decision.
157;00:10:00,685;00:10:03,654;He disrespected me
157;00:10:00,685;00:10:03,654;in front of my men.
158;00:10:03,688;00:10:05,155;That was his decision,
158;00:10:03,688;00:10:05,155;not mine.
159;00:10:05,189;00:10:07,657;He is worth more
159;00:10:05,189;00:10:07,657;to you alive than dead.
160;00:10:07,993;00:10:10,994;The Starks will pay.
161;00:10:11,029;00:10:13,864;Please, Theon,
162;00:10:13,898;00:10:15,832;think what you do.
163;00:10:26,476;00:10:28,376;You'll address me
163;00:10:26,476;00:10:28,376;as Prince Theon
164;00:10:28,411;00:10:30,311;or you'll be next.
165;00:10:30,346;00:10:32,313;Come.
166;00:10:33,182;00:10:34,749;No!
167;00:10:34,784;00:10:37,985;No!
167;00:10:34,784;00:10:37,985;- Theon!
168;00:10:38,854;00:10:40,922;Please!
169;00:10:40,956;00:10:42,824;Ser Rodrik!
170;00:10:42,859;00:10:45,694;He who passes the sentence
170;00:10:42,859;00:10:45,694;should swing the sword.
171;00:10:45,728;00:10:48,497;- I'm begging you!
171;00:10:45,728;00:10:48,497;Coward.
172;00:10:51,267;00:10:54,369;Stop! Stop right now!
173;00:10:54,404;00:10:56,138;You don't give commands anymore,
173;00:10:54,404;00:10:56,138;Little Lord.
174;00:10:56,172;00:10:58,840;Please, stop this. Please stop him.
174;00:10:56,172;00:10:58,840;- Hush now, child.
175;00:10:58,875;00:11:01,977;I'm off to see your father.
176;00:11:04,113;00:11:06,982;You said no harm
176;00:11:04,113;00:11:06,982;would come!
177;00:11:07,016;00:11:09,751;You said no harm would come.
177;00:11:07,016;00:11:09,751;Theon, please.
178;00:11:09,786;00:11:12,588;Any last words, old man?
179;00:11:12,622;00:11:15,524;Gods help you,
179;00:11:12,622;00:11:15,524;Theon Greyjoy.
180;00:11:15,559;00:11:17,659;Now you are truly lost.
181;00:11:17,693;00:11:20,129;Theon, please, don't.
182;00:11:20,163;00:11:23,265;- Do something.
182;00:11:20,163;00:11:23,265;- I'll do anything. Please!
183;00:11:23,299;00:11:24,934;No, please, stop it!
184;00:11:56,368;00:11:58,770;Ghost, stay with us.
185;00:11:58,804;00:12:00,871;Ghost!
186;00:12:00,906;00:12:02,540;There goes your pet.
187;00:12:02,574;00:12:04,141;He's not a pet.
188;00:12:04,176;00:12:06,677;You're right,
188;00:12:04,176;00:12:06,677;he's not.
189;00:12:06,711;00:12:09,280;You can't tame
189;00:12:06,711;00:12:09,280;a wild thing.
190;00:12:09,314;00:12:11,081;You can't trust
190;00:12:09,314;00:12:11,081;a wild thing.
191;00:12:11,116;00:12:14,151;Ghost is different.
191;00:12:11,116;00:12:14,151;So you think.
192;00:12:14,185;00:12:16,553;Wild creatures
192;00:12:14,185;00:12:16,553;have their own rules,
193;00:12:16,588;00:12:18,755;their own reasons.
194;00:12:18,790;00:12:20,758;And you'll never
194;00:12:18,790;00:12:20,758;know them.
195;00:12:20,792;00:12:24,461;Now the wildlings
195;00:12:20,792;00:12:24,461;we're looking for
196;00:12:24,496;00:12:26,897;sleep during the day
196;00:12:24,496;00:12:26,897;and hunt at night.
197;00:12:29,334;00:12:31,902;I thought you said
197;00:12:29,334;00:12:31,902;you couldn't know wild things.
198;00:12:31,936;00:12:33,837;I said you can't.
199;00:12:33,871;00:12:36,907;They find a nice cave
199;00:12:33,871;00:12:36,907;to hide in while the sun's up
200;00:12:36,941;00:12:38,875;and do their killing
200;00:12:36,941;00:12:38,875;when it's dark.
201;00:12:38,910;00:12:41,945;We could do the same.
201;00:12:38,910;00:12:41,945;No, we couldn't.
202;00:12:41,980;00:12:44,181;This is their country.
203;00:12:44,215;00:12:47,251;They know where to walk,
203;00:12:44,215;00:12:47,251;where not to walk.
204;00:12:47,286;00:12:49,187;I've lost good men
204;00:12:47,286;00:12:49,187;who fell into a crevasse
205;00:12:49,221;00:12:51,356;they didn't see
205;00:12:49,221;00:12:51,356;till they were in it.
206;00:12:52,491;00:12:54,960;My father always said
206;00:12:52,491;00:12:54,960;I'm of the North.
207;00:12:56,795;00:12:59,664;I wasn't joking.
207;00:12:56,795;00:12:59,664;Look around, boy.
208;00:12:59,698;00:13:02,934;This look like
208;00:12:59,698;00:13:02,934;home to you?
209;00:13:02,968;00:13:06,171;You start thinking
209;00:13:02,968;00:13:06,171;you know this place, it'll kill you.
210;00:13:07,239;00:13:09,507;You understand me?
211;00:13:09,541;00:13:11,976;No, you don't.
212;00:13:12,010;00:13:13,944;We're at war.
213;00:13:13,979;00:13:15,646;We've always been at war.
214;00:13:15,681;00:13:18,215;It's never going to end 'cause
214;00:13:15,681;00:13:18,215;we're not fighting an enemy.
215;00:13:18,250;00:13:21,819;We're fighting the North
215;00:13:18,250;00:13:21,819;and it's not going anywhere.
216;00:13:21,853;00:13:24,855;The Watch has given
216;00:13:21,853;00:13:24,855;you a great gift.
217;00:13:24,889;00:13:27,424;You only have one thing
217;00:13:24,889;00:13:27,424;to give in return--
218;00:13:27,459;00:13:28,892;your life.
219;00:13:28,926;00:13:30,260;I'll gladly give my life.
220;00:13:30,294;00:13:32,662;I don't want you
220;00:13:30,294;00:13:32,662;to be glad about it.
221;00:13:32,697;00:13:34,697;I want you to curse
221;00:13:32,697;00:13:34,697;and fight
222;00:13:34,732;00:13:37,166;until your heart's
222;00:13:34,732;00:13:37,166;done pumping.
223;00:13:37,201;00:13:39,636;And know this, boy--
224;00:13:39,670;00:13:43,372;your death will be a gift
224;00:13:39,670;00:13:43,372;for them south of the Wall.
225;00:13:43,407;00:13:45,607;They'll never know
225;00:13:43,407;00:13:45,607;what you've done.
226;00:13:45,641;00:13:47,142;They'll never know
226;00:13:45,641;00:13:47,142;how you died.
227;00:13:47,176;00:13:49,277;They won't even
227;00:13:47,176;00:13:49,277;know your damn name,
228;00:13:49,311;00:13:52,213;but they'll be alive because
228;00:13:49,311;00:13:52,213;some nameless bastard
229;00:13:52,247;00:13:55,884;north of the Wall
229;00:13:52,247;00:13:55,884;gave his life for theirs.
230;00:13:55,918;00:13:59,053;Now, do you understand me?
231;00:13:59,088;00:14:00,822;I do.
232;00:14:00,856;00:14:03,224;You're even dumber
232;00:14:00,856;00:14:03,224;than you look.
233;00:14:04,427;00:14:06,494;It's just words, boy,
234;00:14:06,529;00:14:08,496;to keep us a little
234;00:14:06,529;00:14:08,496;warmer in the night,
235;00:14:08,530;00:14:11,767;make us feel like
235;00:14:08,530;00:14:11,767;we've got a purpose.
236;00:14:11,801;00:14:14,236;Come on.
237;00:14:14,270;00:14:16,605;We've got to find these
237;00:14:14,270;00:14:16,605;goat fuckers before night falls
238;00:14:16,630;00:14:18,219;and they find us.
239;00:14:29,889;00:14:32,457;Can you read?
239;00:14:29,889;00:14:32,457;My Lord?
240;00:14:32,492;00:14:35,527;Can you read?
241;00:14:38,298;00:14:41,599;This letter detailing
241;00:14:38,298;00:14:41,599;our infantry movements
242;00:14:41,634;00:14:44,302;was meant for Lord Damon
242;00:14:41,634;00:14:44,302;of House Marbrand.
243;00:14:44,337;00:14:48,140;It was sent to Lord Marlyn

244;00:14:48,174;00:14:50,175;My apologies, My Lord.
244;00:14:48,174;00:14:50,175;I must have--

246;00:14:53,780;00:14:56,549;It's the one on the--
247;00:14:59,520;00:15:02,522;My cupbearer can read
247;00:14:59,520;00:15:02,522;better than you.
248;00:15:11,732;00:15:14,901;To whom does House Dormand
248;00:15:11,732;00:15:14,901;owe allegiance?
249;00:15:17,271;00:15:19,338;My Lord, I--
250;00:15:19,373;00:15:22,175;To the Starks
250;00:15:19,373;00:15:22,175;of Winterfell!
251;00:15:22,209;00:15:26,412;Who have 20,000 men
251;00:15:22,209;00:15:26,412;and my son!
252;00:15:27,848;00:15:29,949;I judged you might be
252;00:15:27,848;00:15:29,949;good for something more
253;00:15:29,983;00:15:32,551;than brutalizing peasants.
254;00:15:32,586;00:15:34,953;I see I overestimated you.
255;00:15:36,422;00:15:39,825;If you ever put my son's
255;00:15:36,422;00:15:39,825;life at risk again, I'll...
256;00:15:39,859;00:15:42,360;Leave us.
257;00:15:50,335;00:15:51,769;Put the book away, girl.
258;00:15:58,643;00:16:02,279;Maybe you should devise our next
258;00:15:58,643;00:16:02,279;battle plan while you're about it.
259;00:16:08,257;00:16:10,475;Lord Petyr Baelish.
259;00:16:08,257;00:16:10,475;Hmmm.
260;00:16:11,322;00:16:13,457;Give us the room.
261;00:16:21,133;00:16:22,968;Clear all this.
262;00:16:26,106;00:16:28,908;Lord Tywin.
262;00:16:26,106;00:16:28,908;Baelish.
263;00:16:36,983;00:16:39,751;Wine?
263;00:16:36,983;00:16:39,751;Thank you.
264;00:16:42,655;00:16:44,589;What news
264;00:16:42,655;00:16:44,589;from the capital?
265;00:16:44,623;00:16:48,025;I travelled here directly
265;00:16:44,623;00:16:48,025;from Renly Baratheon's camp.
266;00:16:48,060;00:16:50,227;Ah, the late king Renly.
267;00:16:50,261;00:16:52,463;Rather a short reign.
268;00:16:52,498;00:16:54,499;Murdered by a woman,
268;00:16:52,498;00:16:54,499;I hear.
269;00:16:54,534;00:16:56,468;So they say.
270;00:16:56,502;00:17:01,641;There has been talk
270;00:16:56,502;00:17:01,641;of other forces at work,
271;00:17:01,676;00:17:04,110;dark forces.
272;00:17:04,145;00:17:06,547;Here.
273;00:17:08,516;00:17:10,952;Men love to blame demons
274;00:17:10,986;00:17:14,722;when their grand plans
274;00:17:10,986;00:17:14,722;unravel.
275;00:17:14,756;00:17:17,558;It is my belief
275;00:17:14,756;00:17:17,558;that a moment of chaos
276;00:17:17,593;00:17:19,994;affords opportunities
276;00:17:17,593;00:17:19,994;lost soon after.
277;00:17:20,028;00:17:23,164;You say that as if you were
277;00:17:20,028;00:17:23,164;the first man alive to think it.
278;00:17:23,198;00:17:26,333;Yes, a crisis
278;00:17:23,198;00:17:26,333;is an opportunity.
279;00:17:26,367;00:17:28,835;What other brilliant insights
279;00:17:26,367;00:17:28,835;have you brought me today?
280;00:17:28,869;00:17:30,570;After the Lannisters
280;00:17:28,869;00:17:30,570;and the Starks,
281;00:17:30,604;00:17:33,039;the Tyrells command
281;00:17:30,604;00:17:33,039;the largest host.
282;00:17:33,074;00:17:35,209;Their lands are the most
282;00:17:33,074;00:17:35,209;fertile in the Seven Kingdoms,
283;00:17:35,243;00:17:39,179;feeding horses and soldiers.
283;00:17:35,243;00:17:39,179;Yes, yes, yes.
284;00:17:39,214;00:17:43,618;The Tyrells have not yet declared
284;00:17:39,214;00:17:43,618;for any of the surviving kings.
285;00:17:43,653;00:17:46,822;Loras wants revenge. He blames
285;00:17:43,653;00:17:46,822;Stannis for Renly's death.
286;00:17:46,856;00:17:49,525;And Margaery--
287;00:17:49,559;00:17:51,328;Wants to be queen.
288;00:17:51,362;00:17:54,163;Yes, she does.
289;00:17:55,465;00:17:59,236;House Tyrell rebelled
289;00:17:55,465;00:17:59,236;against the Iron Throne,
290;00:17:59,270;00:18:02,840;against my grandson.
290;00:17:59,270;00:18:02,840;They did.
291;00:18:02,874;00:18:05,209;And perhaps that treason
291;00:18:02,874;00:18:05,209;should be punished
292;00:18:05,243;00:18:07,145;one day,
293;00:18:07,179;00:18:11,148;after Stannis and Robb Stark
293;00:18:07,179;00:18:11,148;are defeated.
294;00:18:13,385;00:18:15,753;More wine for Lord Baelish.
295;00:18:21,860;00:18:25,129;If you will allow me to represent
295;00:18:21,860;00:18:25,129;your family's interests,
296;00:18:25,163;00:18:27,230;I believe that an advantageous
296;00:18:25,163;00:18:27,230;agreement--
297;00:18:27,265;00:18:30,333;The Tyrell host has
297;00:18:27,265;00:18:30,333;returned to Highgarden?
298;00:18:30,368;00:18:32,535;They have.
299;00:18:32,570;00:18:34,470;Pardon, My Lord.
300;00:18:34,505;00:18:36,439;It's only wine.
301;00:18:37,808;00:18:39,942;You would ride
301;00:18:37,808;00:18:39,942;there yourself?
302;00:18:39,976;00:18:41,877;Tonight, with your leave.
303;00:18:41,911;00:18:44,145;I'll have an answer
303;00:18:41,911;00:18:44,145;by nightfall.
304;00:18:44,180;00:18:45,847;That'll be all, girl.
305;00:18:51,453;00:18:52,988;What else?
306;00:18:53,022;00:18:55,156;On your son
306;00:18:53,022;00:18:55,156;Tyrion's directive,
307;00:18:55,191;00:18:57,692;I met with Catelyn Stark.
308;00:18:57,727;00:18:59,227;Why?
309;00:18:59,262;00:19:01,764;He had an interesting
309;00:18:59,262;00:19:01,764;proposal for her
310;00:19:01,798;00:19:05,001;concerning her daughters.
310;00:19:01,798;00:19:05,001;Hmm.
311;00:19:54,252;00:19:57,420;A girl.
311;00:19:54,252;00:19:57,420;A wildling.
312;00:19:58,522;00:19:59,856;We could question her.
313;00:19:59,890;00:20:01,858;You could.
314;00:20:01,893;00:20:03,493;She won't answer.
315;00:20:03,528;00:20:06,997;I've known a wildling to bite off
315;00:20:03,528;00:20:06,997;his tongue instead of talking.
316;00:20:08,433;00:20:11,234;What's your name?
316;00:20:08,433;00:20:11,234;Ygritte.
317;00:20:11,269;00:20:14,337;She was reaching for this axe
317;00:20:11,269;00:20:14,337;when you got to her.
318;00:20:14,372;00:20:18,108;Give her half a chance,
318;00:20:14,372;00:20:18,108;she'll bury it in your face.
319;00:20:18,142;00:20:20,944;I gave you my name.
320;00:20:22,046;00:20:24,714;I'm Jon Snow.
321;00:20:31,187;00:20:33,122;You ought to burn
321;00:20:31,187;00:20:33,122;them you killed.
322;00:20:33,157;00:20:35,825;We'd need a big
322;00:20:33,157;00:20:35,825;fire for that.
323;00:20:35,859;00:20:39,863;Tell me, Ygritte,
324;00:20:39,897;00:20:41,932;why do you want us
324;00:20:39,897;00:20:41,932;to build a big fire?
325;00:20:41,966;00:20:45,203;Are there some more
325;00:20:41,966;00:20:45,203;friends in the area?
326;00:20:45,237;00:20:48,573;Burn them or maybe you'll
326;00:20:45,237;00:20:48,573;need those swords again.
327;00:20:48,608;00:20:51,143;Our boy here's already
327;00:20:48,608;00:20:51,143;killed one dead man.
328;00:20:51,177;00:20:53,578;He can do it again
328;00:20:51,177;00:20:53,578;if he has to.
329;00:20:53,612;00:20:56,180;What waits
329;00:20:53,612;00:20:56,180;beyond the pass?
330;00:20:56,215;00:20:58,249;The Free Folk.
330;00:20:56,215;00:20:58,249;How many?
331;00:21:00,185;00:21:02,119;Hundreds and thousands.
332;00:21:02,154;00:21:04,689;More than you've
332;00:21:02,154;00:21:04,689;ever seen, Crow.
333;00:21:04,723;00:21:08,125;Why come to the mountains?
334;00:21:08,160;00:21:11,096;What's in the frostfangs
334;00:21:08,160;00:21:11,096;your king could want?
335;00:21:18,838;00:21:21,040;Do you mean to march
335;00:21:18,838;00:21:21,040;on the Wall?
336;00:21:27,114;00:21:29,283;Do you know
336;00:21:27,114;00:21:29,283;who I am, girl?
337;00:21:29,317;00:21:31,819;Qhorin Halfhand.
338;00:21:31,853;00:21:33,353;Tell me true.
339;00:21:33,388;00:21:36,657;If your people captured me,
340;00:21:36,691;00:21:38,659;would they take me prisoner?
341;00:21:38,693;00:21:40,861;They'd take your head
341;00:21:38,693;00:21:40,861;off your shoulders
342;00:21:40,895;00:21:42,997;if they was feeling kind.
343;00:21:43,031;00:21:45,633;If not,
343;00:21:43,031;00:21:45,633;they'd kill you slow.
344;00:21:48,303;00:21:50,671;We have no food for her.
345;00:21:50,705;00:21:53,039;Can't spare a man
345;00:21:50,705;00:21:53,039;to watch her.
346;00:21:53,074;00:21:56,309;Can't let her go. She'll bring
346;00:21:53,074;00:21:56,309;Mance Rayder's army down on us.
347;00:21:56,343;00:21:58,277;It needs to be done.
348;00:21:58,311;00:22:00,812;Want me to do it?
348;00:21:58,311;00:22:00,812;No.
349;00:22:00,847;00:22:03,181;No, I'll do it.
350;00:22:04,817;00:22:06,884;Come, brothers.
351;00:22:06,918;00:22:09,019;We'll leave him to it.
352;00:22:09,053;00:22:11,054;We'll meet you
352;00:22:09,053;00:22:11,054;at the top.
353;00:22:11,089;00:22:12,590;Don't take too long.
354;00:22:12,624;00:22:14,258;We're deep in
354;00:22:12,624;00:22:14,258;their country now.
355;00:22:26,972;00:22:30,775;You never killed
355;00:22:26,972;00:22:30,775;a woman before, did you?
356;00:22:30,809;00:22:33,611;You don't need
356;00:22:30,809;00:22:33,611;to do it.
357;00:22:33,646;00:22:35,847;Mance would take you.
357;00:22:33,646;00:22:35,847;I know he would.
358;00:22:35,881;00:22:38,283;There's secret ways.
359;00:22:38,317;00:22:41,553;The Crows would
359;00:22:38,317;00:22:41,553;never catch us.
360;00:22:41,588;00:22:44,756;I'm as much a Crow
360;00:22:41,588;00:22:44,756;as they are.
361;00:22:56,536;00:22:58,604;Will you burn me...
362;00:22:58,638;00:23:00,639;after?
363;00:23:00,673;00:23:03,175;Can't.
364;00:23:03,209;00:23:05,677;Someone might
364;00:23:03,209;00:23:05,677;see the smoke.
365;00:23:11,350;00:23:13,686;Strike hard and true,
366;00:23:13,720;00:23:15,921;Jon Snow,
367;00:23:15,956;00:23:18,458;or I'll come back
367;00:23:15,956;00:23:18,458;and haunt you.
368;00:23:22,296;00:23:25,232;That's cold.
369;00:23:27,435;00:23:28,969;Go on.
370;00:23:29,004;00:23:31,105;Be quick about it.
371;00:23:38,380;00:23:39,880;Do it.
372;00:23:43,184;00:23:45,251;Bastard, do it!
373;00:25:00,628;00:25:03,863;You can't do it.
373;00:25:00,628;00:25:03,863;We both know it.
374;00:25:08,368;00:25:11,070;The sun's going
374;00:25:08,368;00:25:11,070;down, Jon Snow.
375;00:25:11,104;00:25:14,240;And your friends
375;00:25:11,104;00:25:14,240;are nowhere close.
376;00:25:14,274;00:25:15,641;I'll find them.
377;00:25:15,675;00:25:19,344;Call for the
377;00:25:15,675;00:25:19,344;go on.
378;00:25:19,379;00:25:21,247;Call loudly.
379;00:25:28,221;00:25:30,688;May the Seven guide
379;00:25:28,221;00:25:30,688;the princess on her journey.
380;00:25:32,158;00:25:33,991;May the mother
380;00:25:32,158;00:25:33,991;give her health.
381;00:25:34,026;00:25:36,460;May the crone
381;00:25:34,026;00:25:36,460;give her wisdom.
382;00:25:36,495;00:25:39,463;May the warrior
382;00:25:36,495;00:25:39,463;give her courage.
383;00:25:44,535;00:25:46,736;One day I pray
383;00:25:44,535;00:25:46,736;you love someone.
384;00:25:47,738;00:25:50,439;I pray you love
384;00:25:47,738;00:25:50,439;her so much,
385;00:25:50,473;00:25:52,875;when you close your eyes,
385;00:25:50,473;00:25:52,875;you see her face.
386;00:25:54,945;00:25:57,748;I want that for you.
387;00:25:57,782;00:26:01,318;I want you to know what
387;00:25:57,782;00:26:01,318;it's like to love someone,
388;00:26:01,353;00:26:04,555;to truly love someone,
389;00:26:04,589;00:26:06,958;before I take her
389;00:26:04,589;00:26:06,958;from you.
390;00:26:24,375;00:26:27,277;You sound like a little cat mewling
390;00:26:24,375;00:26:27,277;for his mother.
391;00:26:27,311;00:26:28,811;Princes don't cry.
392;00:26:28,845;00:26:31,648;I saw you cry.
392;00:26:28,845;00:26:31,648;Did you say something, My Lady?
393;00:26:31,682;00:26:34,952;My little brother cried
393;00:26:31,682;00:26:34,952;when I left Winterfell.
394;00:26:34,986;00:26:37,021;So?
395;00:26:37,055;00:26:38,255;It seems a normal thing.
396;00:26:38,290;00:26:40,291;Is your little brother
396;00:26:38,290;00:26:40,291;a prince?
397;00:26:40,325;00:26:42,427;No.
398;00:26:42,461;00:26:44,829;Not really relevant,
398;00:26:42,461;00:26:44,829;then, is it?
399;00:26:48,668;00:26:50,703;Come, dog.
400;00:26:58,311;00:27:00,144;Hail, Joffrey!

404;00:27:08,886;00:27:10,186;All hail the king.
405;00:27:10,221;00:27:12,555;He's no king.
405;00:27:10,221;00:27:12,555;He's a bastard!
406;00:27:14,258;00:27:16,025;Please, Your Grace,
406;00:27:14,258;00:27:16,025;we're hungry.
407;00:27:18,896;00:27:21,965;- Freak!
407;00:27:18,896;00:27:21,965;Get the prince back to the keep now.
408;00:27:21,999;00:27:24,334;Yes, My Lord.

409;00:27:24,369;00:27:26,336;give us some food!
410;00:27:26,371;00:27:29,206;Bread, Your Grace,
410;00:27:26,371;00:27:29,206;please!
411;00:27:32,144;00:27:33,911;Who threw that?
412;00:27:33,945;00:27:35,913;I want the man
412;00:27:33,945;00:27:35,913;who threw that.
413;00:27:35,947;00:27:37,815;Find who did that
413;00:27:35,947;00:27:37,815;and bring him to me!
414;00:27:37,849;00:27:39,150;Hold on!

415;00:27:39,184;00:27:41,686;Kill them all!
416;00:27:47,426;00:27:49,794;Move. Move!
416;00:27:47,426;00:27:49,794;- Pull back!
417;00:27:49,829;00:27:51,763;Tear him to pieces!
418;00:27:51,797;00:27:54,833;What are you doing?
418;00:27:51,797;00:27:54,833;I want these people executed!
419;00:27:54,867;00:27:57,168;And they want
419;00:27:54,867;00:27:57,168;the same for you.
420;00:28:23,326;00:28:25,627;Where's Sansa?

429;00:29:10,542;00:29:13,110;Hey!
430;00:29:13,144;00:29:14,878;Traitors!
431;00:29:14,912;00:29:16,780;I'll have
431;00:29:14,912;00:29:16,780;all their heads.
432;00:29:16,814;00:29:18,648;Oh, you blind,
432;00:29:16,814;00:29:18,648;bloody fool.
433;00:29:18,683;00:29:20,617;You can't insult me.
434;00:29:20,651;00:29:23,519;We've had vicious kings
434;00:29:20,651;00:29:23,519;and we've had idiot kings,
435;00:29:23,554;00:29:25,357;but I don't know if
435;00:29:23,554;00:29:25,357;we've ever been cursed with
436;00:29:25,382;00:29:26,489;a vicious idiot for a king.
437;00:29:26,490;00:29:28,257;You can't--
437;00:29:26,490;00:29:28,257;I can, I am.
438;00:29:28,291;00:29:29,792;They attacked me!
439;00:29:29,826;00:29:33,329;They threw a cow pie at you,
439;00:29:29,826;00:29:33,329;so you decided to kill them all?
440;00:29:33,363;00:29:35,132;They're starving,
440;00:29:33,363;00:29:35,132;you fool.
441;00:29:35,166;00:29:37,000;All because of a war
441;00:29:35,166;00:29:37,000;you started.
442;00:29:37,035;00:29:39,536;You're talking to a king!
443;00:29:39,571;00:29:41,806;And now I've struck a king.
444;00:29:41,840;00:29:44,008;Did my hand fall
444;00:29:41,840;00:29:44,008;from my wrist?
445;00:29:44,043;00:29:46,044;Where is the Stark girl?
446;00:29:46,079;00:29:47,613;Let them have her.
447;00:29:47,647;00:29:51,083;If she dies, you'll never
447;00:29:47,647;00:29:51,083;get your Uncle Jaime back.
448;00:29:51,117;00:29:53,953;You owe him quite a bit,
448;00:29:51,117;00:29:53,953;you know.
449;00:30:02,429;00:30:04,330;Where are you going?
450;00:30:04,365;00:30:08,134;You ever been fucked, little girl?
451;00:30:08,169;00:30:11,471;Come here.
452;00:30:11,506;00:30:13,507;Take some men and go and find
452;00:30:11,506;00:30:13,507;the Stark girl.
453;00:30:13,541;00:30:15,475;I take my orders
453;00:30:13,541;00:30:15,475;from the king.
454;00:30:16,944;00:30:19,213;This way!
455;00:30:24,587;00:30:27,356;Please!
456;00:30:27,390;00:30:29,157;No, no.

458;00:30:52,179;00:30:54,580;You're all right now,
458;00:30:52,179;00:30:54,580;little bird.
459;00:30:54,615;00:30:56,549;You're all right.
460;00:31:09,965;00:31:13,968;- We'll get you. We'll get you.
460;00:31:09,965;00:31:13,968;- This way.
461;00:31:16,071;00:31:17,571;Are you hurt,
461;00:31:16,071;00:31:17,571;My Lady?
462;00:31:17,606;00:31:19,239;The little bird's
462;00:31:17,606;00:31:19,239;bleeding.
463;00:31:19,274;00:31:21,007;Someone take her back
463;00:31:19,274;00:31:21,007;to her cage,
464;00:31:21,042;00:31:22,909;see to that cut.
465;00:31:22,943;00:31:24,477;Well done, Clegane.
466;00:31:25,345;00:31:27,480;I didn't do it for you.
467;00:31:29,449;00:31:31,216;He shouldn't
467;00:31:29,449;00:31:31,216;make me wait.
468;00:31:31,250;00:31:35,721;The Spice King is the second
468;00:31:31,250;00:31:35,721;wealthiest man in Qarth.
469;00:31:35,755;00:31:37,889;He makes everyone wait.
470;00:31:37,924;00:31:41,159;Of course, you could have
470;00:31:37,924;00:31:41,159;avoided this embarrassment
471;00:31:41,194;00:31:43,662;if you married
471;00:31:41,194;00:31:43,662;the wealthiest man in Qarth.
472;00:31:43,696;00:31:45,731;I already have a husband.
473;00:31:45,765;00:31:48,100;Khal Drogo is gone,

474;00:31:48,134;00:31:52,004;You are far too young
474;00:31:48,134;00:31:52,004;to be a widow forever
475;00:31:52,039;00:31:54,340;and far too beautiful.
476;00:31:54,375;00:31:56,142;And you are far too smart
477;00:31:56,176;00:31:59,645;to think that I will
477;00:31:56,176;00:31:59,645;succumb to flattery.
478;00:31:59,680;00:32:01,614;I have travelled
478;00:31:59,680;00:32:01,614;very far in my life
479;00:32:01,649;00:32:03,350;and met many women,
480;00:32:03,384;00:32:05,185;but none that are
480;00:32:03,384;00:32:05,185;immune to flattery.
481;00:32:05,219;00:32:07,921;The Mother of Dragons!
481;00:32:05,219;00:32:07,921;Ah.
482;00:32:07,956;00:32:09,956;Here he comes.
483;00:32:09,991;00:32:13,593;Forgive me. I had terrible
483;00:32:09,991;00:32:13,593;dreams last night.
484;00:32:13,628;00:32:15,262;Terrible dreams.
485;00:32:15,296;00:32:18,465;I could not sleep
485;00:32:15,296;00:32:18,465;until the sun was shining
486;00:32:18,499;00:32:21,001;and the birds were singing.
487;00:32:21,035;00:32:23,770;Look what a beauty you are
488;00:32:23,804;00:32:26,372;now the Red Waste
488;00:32:23,804;00:32:26,372;has been washed off you.
489;00:32:26,407;00:32:29,742;I am sorry about
489;00:32:26,407;00:32:29,742;all that unpleasantness.
490;00:32:29,776;00:32:34,246;The silver hair
490;00:32:29,776;00:32:34,246;of a true Targaryen.
491;00:32:34,281;00:32:37,717;Xaro Xhoan Daxos,
491;00:32:34,281;00:32:37,717;she is far too lovely
492;00:32:37,752;00:32:40,287;for a glorified
492;00:32:37,752;00:32:40,287;dockworker like yourself.
493;00:32:40,321;00:32:43,857;Very true, and yet they say
493;00:32:40,321;00:32:43,857;that your grandfather,
494;00:32:43,891;00:32:45,959;who sold pepper
494;00:32:43,891;00:32:45,959;off the back of a wagon,
495;00:32:45,994;00:32:49,396;married a lady far lovelier
495;00:32:45,994;00:32:49,396;and higher born than himself.
496;00:32:49,431;00:32:51,664;Every lady alive
496;00:32:49,431;00:32:51,664;was lovelier
497;00:32:51,699;00:32:53,933;and higher born
497;00:32:51,699;00:32:53,933;than my grandfather.
498;00:32:53,968;00:32:55,801;Ahem.
499;00:32:55,836;00:32:59,371;Did my servants not offer you
499;00:32:55,836;00:32:59,371;something to eat, to drink?
500;00:32:59,406;00:33:01,340;I'll have them flogged
500;00:32:59,406;00:33:01,340;in the square.
501;00:33:01,374;00:33:03,308;Thank you, My Lord.
501;00:33:01,374;00:33:03,308;You are a gracious host,
502;00:33:03,343;00:33:06,244;but there is no servant alive
502;00:33:03,343;00:33:06,244;that can bring me what I want.
503;00:33:06,278;00:33:09,080;Oh, she has a talent
503;00:33:06,278;00:33:09,080;for drama, this one.
504;00:33:09,114;00:33:13,218;So, my little princess,
504;00:33:09,114;00:33:13,218;what is it you want?
505;00:33:13,286;00:33:14,686;My birthright--
506;00:33:14,721;00:33:16,622;the Seven Kingdoms
506;00:33:14,721;00:33:16,622;of Westeros.
507;00:33:16,656;00:33:19,325;I fear I'm no better than
507;00:33:16,656;00:33:19,325;a servant in this regard.
508;00:33:19,359;00:33:21,427;I cannot give you
508;00:33:19,359;00:33:21,427;what I do not have.
509;00:33:21,462;00:33:24,064;I'm not asking you
509;00:33:21,462;00:33:24,064;for the Kingdoms.
510;00:33:24,098;00:33:25,866;I'm asking you
510;00:33:24,098;00:33:25,866;for ships.
511;00:33:25,900;00:33:27,535;I need to cross
511;00:33:25,900;00:33:27,535;the Narrow Sea.
512;00:33:27,569;00:33:29,437;I need my ships as well.
513;00:33:29,471;00:33:30,938;I use them, you see,
514;00:33:30,973;00:33:33,441;to bring spices from
514;00:33:30,973;00:33:33,441;one port to another.
515;00:33:33,475;00:33:34,975;Whatever you grant me
515;00:33:33,475;00:33:34,975;now will be repaid
516;00:33:35,010;00:33:37,779;three times over when
516;00:33:35,010;00:33:37,779;I retake the Iron Throne.
517;00:33:37,813;00:33:39,247;Retake?
518;00:33:39,281;00:33:41,415;Did you once sit
518;00:33:39,281;00:33:41,415;on the Iron Throne?
519;00:33:41,450;00:33:44,285;My father sat there
519;00:33:41,450;00:33:44,285;before he was murdered.
520;00:33:44,319;00:33:46,687;But if you did not
520;00:33:44,319;00:33:46,687;sit on it yourself,
521;00:33:46,722;00:33:50,158;would it not be correct
521;00:33:46,722;00:33:50,158;to say take the Iron Throne?
522;00:33:50,192;00:33:52,226;I didn't come here
522;00:33:50,192;00:33:52,226;to argue grammar.
523;00:33:52,260;00:33:55,129;Of course not.
523;00:33:52,260;00:33:55,129;You came to take my ships.
524;00:33:55,163;00:33:57,731;So let me explain
524;00:33:55,163;00:33:57,731;my position,
525;00:33:57,766;00:33:59,700;little princess.
526;00:33:59,735;00:34:03,203;Unlike you, I do not
526;00:33:59,735;00:34:03,203;have exalted ancestors.
527;00:34:03,238;00:34:05,206;I make my living by trade.
528;00:34:05,240;00:34:08,575;And I judge every trade
528;00:34:05,240;00:34:08,575;on its merits.
529;00:34:08,610;00:34:10,243;You ask for ships.
530;00:34:10,278;00:34:13,313;You say I shall be
530;00:34:10,278;00:34:13,313;repaid triple.
531;00:34:13,347;00:34:16,149;I do not doubt your honesty
531;00:34:13,347;00:34:16,149;or your intentions.
532;00:34:16,183;00:34:18,418;But before you
532;00:34:16,183;00:34:18,418;repay your debts,
533;00:34:18,452;00:34:21,053;you must seize
533;00:34:18,452;00:34:21,053;the Seven Kingdoms.
534;00:34:21,088;00:34:23,755;Do you have an army?
534;00:34:21,088;00:34:23,755;Not yet.
535;00:34:23,790;00:34:25,257;You do not have an army.
536;00:34:25,291;00:34:27,392;Do you have powerful
536;00:34:25,291;00:34:27,392;allies in Westeros?
537;00:34:27,427;00:34:29,561;There are many there
537;00:34:27,427;00:34:29,561;that support my claim.
538;00:34:29,596;00:34:31,063;When were you
538;00:34:29,596;00:34:31,063;there last?
539;00:34:32,065;00:34:33,699;I left when
539;00:34:32,065;00:34:33,699;I was a baby.
540;00:34:33,734;00:34:36,636;So, in truth,
540;00:34:33,734;00:34:36,636;you have no allies.
541;00:34:36,671;00:34:39,426;The people will rise
541;00:34:36,671;00:34:39,426;to fight for their rightful
542;00:34:39,451;00:34:41,141;Queen when I return.
543;00:34:41,142;00:34:43,010;Ah.
544;00:34:43,044;00:34:44,812;Forgive me,
544;00:34:43,044;00:34:44,812;little princess,
545;00:34:44,846;00:34:48,283;but I cannot make an investment
545;00:34:44,846;00:34:48,283;based on wishes and dreams.
546;00:34:48,317;00:34:49,784;Now if you'll pardon me.
547;00:34:49,819;00:34:52,520;Do you know Illyrio Mopatis,
547;00:34:49,819;00:34:52,520;Magister of Pentos?
548;00:34:52,555;00:34:55,190;Yes, we've met.
548;00:34:52,555;00:34:55,190;A shrewd man.
549;00:34:55,224;00:34:58,826;For my wedding he gave me
549;00:34:55,224;00:34:58,826;three petrified dragon eggs.
550;00:34:58,861;00:35:01,729;He believed--
550;00:34:58,861;00:35:01,729;the world believed--
551;00:35:01,763;00:35:03,697;that the ages
551;00:35:01,763;00:35:03,697;had turned them to stone.
552;00:35:03,732;00:35:06,934;How many centuries has it been
552;00:35:03,732;00:35:06,934;since dragons roamed the skies?
553;00:35:06,968;00:35:09,936;But I dreamt that
553;00:35:06,968;00:35:09,936;if I carried those eggs
554;00:35:09,970;00:35:12,439;into a great fire,
554;00:35:09,970;00:35:12,439;they would hatch.
555;00:35:12,473;00:35:17,011;When I stepped into the fire,
555;00:35:12,473;00:35:17,011;my own people thought I was mad.
556;00:35:17,045;00:35:19,213;But when the fire
556;00:35:17,045;00:35:19,213;burned out,
557;00:35:19,248;00:35:21,449;I was unhurt,
558;00:35:21,483;00:35:24,319;the Mother of Dragons.
559;00:35:26,889;00:35:29,157;Do you understand?
560;00:35:31,728;00:35:34,296;I'm no ordinary woman.
561;00:35:34,330;00:35:37,298;My dreams come true.
562;00:35:42,071;00:35:44,338;I admire your passion.
563;00:35:45,940;00:35:49,243;But in business, I trust
563;00:35:45,940;00:35:49,243;in logic, not passion.
564;00:35:49,277;00:35:50,944;I'm sorry, little princess.
565;00:35:50,978;00:35:53,313;I am not
565;00:35:50,978;00:35:53,313;your little princess.
566;00:35:53,347;00:35:56,383;I am Daenerys Stormborn
566;00:35:53,347;00:35:56,383;of the blood of old Valyria
567;00:35:56,417;00:35:58,419;and I will take
567;00:35:56,417;00:35:58,419;what is mine.
568;00:35:58,453;00:36:01,555;With fire and blood,
568;00:35:58,453;00:36:01,555;I will take it.
569;00:36:01,589;00:36:05,159;Yes, My Lady,
569;00:36:01,589;00:36:05,159;but not with my ships.
570;00:36:22,576;00:36:25,712;Who taught you to read?
571;00:36:25,746;00:36:28,014;My father, My Lord.
572;00:36:28,049;00:36:30,017;Hmm.
573;00:36:30,051;00:36:32,252;I taught my son
573;00:36:30,051;00:36:32,252;Jaime to read.
574;00:36:35,256;00:36:37,257;The Maester came
574;00:36:35,256;00:36:37,257;to me one day,
575;00:36:37,291;00:36:39,459;told me he wasn't learning.
576;00:36:39,494;00:36:42,262;He couldn't make sense
576;00:36:39,494;00:36:42,262;of the letters.
577;00:36:42,297;00:36:44,999;He reversed them
577;00:36:42,297;00:36:44,999;in his head.
578;00:36:45,033;00:36:47,869;The Maester said he'd heard
578;00:36:45,033;00:36:47,869;tell of this affliction
579;00:36:47,903;00:36:49,938;and that we simply
579;00:36:47,903;00:36:49,938;must accept it.
580;00:36:49,972;00:36:52,040;Ha!
581;00:36:52,075;00:36:55,544;After that,
581;00:36:52,075;00:36:55,544;I sat Jaime down
582;00:36:55,579;00:36:58,748;for four hours every day
582;00:36:55,579;00:36:58,748;until he learned.
583;00:36:58,782;00:37:03,987;He hated me for it,
583;00:36:58,782;00:37:03,987;for a time.
584;00:37:04,022;00:37:06,657;For a long time,
585;00:37:06,692;00:37:08,526;but he learned.
586;00:37:13,298;00:37:16,400;Where is your father?
586;00:37:13,298;00:37:16,400;Is he alive?
587;00:37:19,370;00:37:20,904;Who was he?
588;00:37:20,938;00:37:23,540;A stonemason.
589;00:37:23,574;00:37:25,874;A stonemason
589;00:37:23,574;00:37:25,874;who could read?
590;00:37:25,909;00:37:28,310;Hmm.
590;00:37:25,909;00:37:28,310;He taught himself.
591;00:37:28,344;00:37:31,079;Quite a man.
592;00:37:32,114;00:37:34,416;What killed him?
593;00:37:36,018;00:37:38,152;Loyalty.
594;00:37:39,689;00:37:41,857;You're a sharp
594;00:37:39,689;00:37:41,857;little thing, aren't you?
595;00:37:45,228;00:37:46,528;Did...
596;00:37:48,331;00:37:51,667;Forgive me, My Lord.
596;00:37:48,331;00:37:51,667;I shouldn't ask questions.
597;00:37:52,670;00:37:54,937;No...
598;00:37:54,972;00:37:57,874;But you've already begun.
599;00:37:57,908;00:38:01,344;Did you know
599;00:37:57,908;00:38:01,344;your father, My Lord?
600;00:38:01,378;00:38:03,513;I did.
601;00:38:04,949;00:38:06,717;I grew up with him.
602;00:38:08,653;00:38:11,589;I watched him
602;00:38:08,653;00:38:11,589;grow old.
603;00:38:15,161;00:38:16,862;He loved us.
604;00:38:16,896;00:38:19,698;He was a good man,
605;00:38:19,733;00:38:22,434;but a weak man,
606;00:38:22,469;00:38:25,971;a weak man who nearly destroyed
606;00:38:22,469;00:38:25,971;our House and name.
607;00:38:28,542;00:38:30,376;I'm cold.
608;00:38:30,411;00:38:33,112;I'll fetch more wood
608;00:38:30,411;00:38:33,112;for the fire, My Lord.
609;00:38:33,147;00:38:35,515;Mmm.
610;00:39:01,976;00:39:03,643;Where are you going, girl?
611;00:39:03,678;00:39:06,613;The armory,
611;00:39:03,678;00:39:06,613;My Lord.
612;00:39:06,648;00:39:08,249;Why?
613;00:39:08,283;00:39:10,117;Lord Tywin sent me.
614;00:39:12,087;00:39:14,355;What might this be?
615;00:39:14,389;00:39:17,291;Lord Tywin gave it to me.
616;00:39:17,325;00:39:19,393;What for?
617;00:39:19,427;00:39:22,262;To take to the armory.
618;00:39:22,297;00:39:24,798;Why would he do that?
619;00:39:26,768;00:39:28,402;Let's go and ask him.
620;00:39:31,005;00:39:33,307;Move!
621;00:39:34,809;00:39:37,278;Get out of the way!
622;00:40:06,942;00:40:08,876;Amory Lorch.
623;00:40:08,910;00:40:10,911;A girl has named
623;00:40:08,910;00:40:10,911;a second name.
624;00:40:10,946;00:40:12,513;A man will do
624;00:40:10,946;00:40:12,513;what must be done.
625;00:40:12,547;00:40:14,482;Now!
626;00:40:14,516;00:40:18,386;A girl cannot tell a man when
626;00:40:14,516;00:40:18,386;exactly he must do a thing.
627;00:40:18,421;00:40:20,689;A man cannot make a thing
627;00:40:18,421;00:40:20,689;happen before its time.
628;00:40:20,723;00:40:22,658;But he's going to tell Tywin.
628;00:40:20,723;00:40:22,658;He's getting away.
629;00:40:22,692;00:40:25,694;It has to be now.
630;00:40:32,870;00:40:34,970;Guard!
631;00:40:44,247;00:40:46,581;Your Grace.
631;00:40:44,247;00:40:46,581;Your Grace.
632;00:40:50,453;00:40:52,987;My honor, Your Grace.
633;00:40:53,022;00:40:55,456;Your Grace.
634;00:41:00,529;00:41:03,063;Your Grace.
634;00:41:00,529;00:41:03,063;Quent.
635;00:41:24,020;00:41:25,887;Lady Talisa.
636;00:41:26,889;00:41:28,490;Your Grace.
637;00:41:30,260;00:41:32,061;I'm not sure I'm a lady.
638;00:41:32,095;00:41:34,229;Westerosi customs are still
638;00:41:32,095;00:41:34,229;a bit foreign to me.
639;00:41:34,264;00:41:36,665;It's hard to keep
639;00:41:34,264;00:41:36,665;all the rules straight.
640;00:41:36,699;00:41:39,801;But if I remember
640;00:41:36,699;00:41:39,801;my lessons,
641;00:41:39,836;00:41:42,370;a woman of noble birth
641;00:41:39,836;00:41:42,370;is always called a lady
642;00:41:42,405;00:41:44,905;unless she's a queen
642;00:41:42,405;00:41:44,905;or a princess.
643;00:41:44,940;00:41:47,140;I could find
643;00:41:44,940;00:41:47,140;someone who knows.
644;00:41:47,175;00:41:49,743;Why are you so sure
644;00:41:47,175;00:41:49,743;I'm of noble birth?
645;00:41:49,777;00:41:51,811;Because it's obvious.
646;00:41:51,845;00:41:55,481;What if I told you my father
646;00:41:51,845;00:41:55,481;sold lace on the long bridge
647;00:41:55,516;00:41:58,451;and my mother, my brother, and I lived
647;00:41:55,516;00:41:58,451;with him above our shop?
648;00:41:59,953;00:42:01,320;I'd call you a liar.
649;00:42:01,355;00:42:04,757;Not very noble to accuse
649;00:42:01,355;00:42:04,757;a lady of dishonesty.
650;00:42:09,028;00:42:10,896;I always thought
650;00:42:09,028;00:42:10,896;I was a brilliant liar.
651;00:42:11,998;00:42:14,299;Better at amputations,
651;00:42:11,998;00:42:14,299;I'm afraid.
652;00:42:19,404;00:42:20,972;Quite a pretty spot.
653;00:42:21,006;00:42:23,641;Will we be here long?
654;00:42:23,675;00:42:26,410;I couldn't really discuss
654;00:42:23,675;00:42:26,410;troop movements with you.
655;00:42:26,444;00:42:28,879;I'm not a spy.
656;00:42:28,913;00:42:31,981;Of course a spy
656;00:42:28,913;00:42:31,981;would deny being a spy.
657;00:42:33,284;00:42:35,819;You're right.
657;00:42:33,284;00:42:35,819;You've found me out.
658;00:42:35,853;00:42:37,587;I'm writing a letter
658;00:42:35,853;00:42:37,587;to the Lannisters.
659;00:42:37,622;00:42:40,057;The young wolf
659;00:42:37,622;00:42:40,057;is on the move.
660;00:42:41,960;00:42:43,795;Perhaps you'd join me...
661;00:42:45,298;00:42:48,100;If you've got time,
661;00:42:45,298;00:42:48,100;of course, for, well...
662;00:42:48,134;00:42:50,436;Robb.
663;00:42:51,604;00:42:53,739;Mother.
664;00:42:59,512;00:43:02,381;Mother, this is
664;00:42:59,512;00:43:02,381;Lady Talisa.
665;00:43:02,415;00:43:04,683;She's been helping
665;00:43:02,415;00:43:04,683;with the wounded.
666;00:43:04,717;00:43:07,619;She's been very...
666;00:43:04,717;00:43:07,619;helpful.
667;00:43:07,653;00:43:09,187;Lady Talisa.
668;00:43:09,221;00:43:10,888;Lady Stark.
669;00:43:10,923;00:43:12,756;Lady Talisa...?
670;00:43:12,791;00:43:16,360;Maegyr.
670;00:43:12,791;00:43:16,360;Maegyr?
671;00:43:16,395;00:43:19,330;Forgive me,
671;00:43:16,395;00:43:19,330;I do not know this name.
672;00:43:19,365;00:43:22,434;An uncommon name here.
672;00:43:19,365;00:43:22,434;An old name in Volantis.
673;00:43:23,503;00:43:26,639;Excuse me, My Lady.
673;00:43:23,503;00:43:26,639;Your Grace.
674;00:43:35,216;00:43:36,884;I've missed you.
675;00:43:36,918;00:43:40,321;Yes, you look
675;00:43:36,918;00:43:40,321;positively forlorn.
676;00:43:40,355;00:43:43,190;You surprised me,
676;00:43:40,355;00:43:43,190;that's all.
677;00:43:43,225;00:43:46,394;I didn't think
677;00:43:43,225;00:43:46,394;I'd see you today.
678;00:43:46,428;00:43:48,796;I wish that you were free
678;00:43:46,428;00:43:48,796;to follow your heart.
679;00:43:48,831;00:43:50,264;I know.
680;00:43:50,299;00:43:52,967;You have inherited your
680;00:43:50,299;00:43:52,967;father's responsibilities.
681;00:43:53,001;00:43:55,803;I'm afraid they come
681;00:43:53,001;00:43:55,803;at a cost.
682;00:43:55,837;00:43:59,240;I know.
682;00:43:55,837;00:43:59,240;You are promised to another--
683;00:44:00,142;00:44:03,744;a debt that must be paid.
684;00:44:03,779;00:44:06,147;I haven't forgotten.
684;00:44:03,779;00:44:06,147;Your Grace.
685;00:44:06,182;00:44:09,918;My Lady.
685;00:44:06,182;00:44:09,918;News from Winterfell.
686;00:44:22,298;00:44:25,100;Your brothers desert you?
687;00:44:25,134;00:44:27,368;I can tell you
687;00:44:25,134;00:44:27,368;which way to go.
688;00:44:27,403;00:44:30,038;We'll stop here.
689;00:44:30,072;00:44:32,040;Too dark to go
689;00:44:30,072;00:44:32,040;any farther today.
690;00:44:32,074;00:44:34,976;Here? There's no
690;00:44:32,074;00:44:34,976;shelter here.
691;00:44:35,011;00:44:36,411;There's no shelter
691;00:44:35,011;00:44:36,411;anywhere.
692;00:44:36,445;00:44:39,181;There is if you know
692;00:44:36,445;00:44:39,181;where to look.
693;00:44:42,618;00:44:44,586;The cold
693;00:44:42,618;00:44:44,586;could kill us both.
694;00:44:44,620;00:44:46,621;If you light a fire--
694;00:44:44,620;00:44:46,621;No fire.
695;00:44:46,655;00:44:49,457;But a fire is--
695;00:44:46,655;00:44:49,457;No fire.
696;00:44:52,094;00:44:54,262;Have it your way.
697;00:45:01,170;00:45:03,772;We'll stay warmer
697;00:45:01,170;00:45:03,772;if we stay close.
698;00:45:05,742;00:45:08,310;Bet you freeze to death
698;00:45:05,742;00:45:08,310;before I do.
699;00:45:10,147;00:45:12,582;Bet your life.
700;00:45:37,041;00:45:39,176;Think they're out
700;00:45:37,041;00:45:39,176;looking for you?
701;00:45:40,578;00:45:43,347;Yes.
701;00:45:40,578;00:45:43,347;Think they'll find you?
702;00:45:43,382;00:45:45,583;Yes.
703;00:45:48,287;00:45:50,321;You're brave.
704;00:45:51,357;00:45:53,190;Stupid,
705;00:45:53,225;00:45:55,126;but brave.
706;00:45:57,763;00:46:01,032;We start again at first light.
706;00:45:57,763;00:46:01,032;Get some sleep.
707;00:46:17,082;00:46:18,849;Stop moving.
708;00:46:18,884;00:46:22,554;I'm just trying
708;00:46:18,884;00:46:22,554;to get comfortable.
709;00:46:22,588;00:46:24,456;Stop it!
710;00:46:36,836;00:46:39,371;You're still moving.
710;00:46:36,836;00:46:39,371;Was I?
711;00:46:39,405;00:46:42,007;I didn't notice
711;00:46:39,405;00:46:42,007;that time.
712;00:46:53,084;00:46:54,819;This cannot be true.
713;00:46:54,853;00:46:56,554;We've had ravens
713;00:46:54,853;00:46:56,554;from White Harbor,
714;00:46:56,588;00:46:58,790;Barrowton
714;00:46:56,588;00:46:58,790;and the Dreadfort.
715;00:46:58,824;00:47:00,825;I'm afraid it is true.
716;00:47:01,727;00:47:03,628;Why?
716;00:47:01,727;00:47:03,628;Why would Theon--
717;00:47:03,663;00:47:05,898;Because the Greyjoys
717;00:47:03,663;00:47:05,898;are treasonous whores.
718;00:47:05,932;00:47:08,601;My brothers?
718;00:47:05,932;00:47:08,601;We've heard nothing of them.
719;00:47:10,571;00:47:12,873;But Rodrik Cassel is dead.
720;00:47:15,276;00:47:17,577;I told you,
720;00:47:15,276;00:47:17,577;never trust a Greyjoy!
721;00:47:20,582;00:47:22,716;I must go North at once.
722;00:47:22,750;00:47:24,885;There's still a war
722;00:47:22,750;00:47:24,885;to win, Your Grace.
723;00:47:24,919;00:47:27,387;How can I call myself king
723;00:47:24,919;00:47:27,387;if I can't hold my own castle?
724;00:47:27,421;00:47:28,923;How can I ask men
724;00:47:27,421;00:47:28,923;to follow me if I can't--
725;00:47:28,948;00:47:30,657;You are a king.
726;00:47:30,658;00:47:33,493;And that means you don't have
726;00:47:30,658;00:47:33,493;to do everything yourself.
727;00:47:33,528;00:47:35,329;Let me go
727;00:47:33,528;00:47:35,329;and talk to Theon.
728;00:47:35,363;00:47:38,266;There will be no talk.
728;00:47:35,363;00:47:38,266;He will die for this.
729;00:47:38,300;00:47:41,569;Theon holds the castle
729;00:47:38,300;00:47:41,569;with a skeleton crew.
730;00:47:41,603;00:47:43,938;Let me send word to
730;00:47:41,603;00:47:43,938;my bastard at the Dreadfort.
731;00:47:43,972;00:47:48,176;He can raise a few hundred men and
731;00:47:43,972;00:47:48,176;retake Winterfell before the new moon.
732;00:47:48,210;00:47:51,312;We have the Lannisters
732;00:47:48,210;00:47:51,312;on the run.
733;00:47:51,347;00:47:55,984;If you march all the way back north
733;00:47:51,347;00:47:55,984;now, you'll lose what you gained.
734;00:47:56,018;00:47:59,655;My boy would be honored to
734;00:47:56,018;00:47:59,655;bring you Prince Theon's head.
735;00:47:59,689;00:48:04,293;Tell your son Bran and Rickon's
735;00:47:59,689;00:48:04,293;safety is paramount.
736;00:48:04,327;00:48:07,329;And Theon-- I want him
736;00:48:04,327;00:48:07,329;brought to me alive.
737;00:48:08,865;00:48:11,333;I want to look him
737;00:48:08,865;00:48:11,333;in the eye and ask him why.
738;00:48:11,368;00:48:13,969;And then I'll take
738;00:48:11,368;00:48:13,969;his head myself.
739;00:48:14,004;00:48:17,873;Why on earth would I trust the word
739;00:48:14,004;00:48:17,873;of a lying little savage like you?
740;00:48:17,907;00:48:19,808;I'm no liar.
741;00:48:20,944;00:48:22,878;All wildlings
741;00:48:20,944;00:48:22,878;are liars and savages
742;00:48:22,912;00:48:24,747;with no loyalty
742;00:48:22,912;00:48:24,747;to anything or anyone.
743;00:48:24,781;00:48:27,116;I done what I had
743;00:48:24,781;00:48:27,116;to do to stay alive.
744;00:48:27,151;00:48:30,019;I hate the Starks
744;00:48:27,151;00:48:30,019;as well as you do.
745;00:48:30,053;00:48:33,356;Let me serve you,
745;00:48:30,053;00:48:33,356;My Lord.
746;00:48:33,391;00:48:36,193;How? And don't tell me
746;00:48:33,391;00:48:36,193;to put a spear in your hand.
747;00:48:36,227;00:48:38,695;There are other ways
747;00:48:36,227;00:48:38,695;to serve, My Lord.
748;00:48:38,729;00:48:41,264;I'm a prince now,
748;00:48:38,729;00:48:41,264;and you'd do well--
749;00:48:41,299;00:48:44,201;There are other ways
749;00:48:41,299;00:48:44,201;to serve, my prince.
750;00:48:48,674;00:48:50,309;Like what?
751;00:48:52,845;00:48:55,648;We know things,
751;00:48:52,845;00:48:55,648;the Free people.
752;00:48:55,682;00:48:58,250;You know things?
753;00:48:58,285;00:49:00,186;Like what?
754;00:49:00,220;00:49:02,488;How to eat dirt?
755;00:49:02,522;00:49:05,524;Other things.
756;00:49:06,693;00:49:09,294;Savage things.
757;00:49:11,297;00:49:13,131;Wait outside.
758;00:49:30,047;00:49:32,249;I always wondered
758;00:49:30,047;00:49:32,249;what you had under there.
759;00:49:32,283;00:49:35,285;It comes at a price.
760;00:49:35,319;00:49:37,587;I'm not killing you.
760;00:49:35,319;00:49:37,587;That's your price.
761;00:49:37,622;00:49:39,189;I already had that.
762;00:49:40,725;00:49:42,192;What do you want, then,
763;00:49:42,226;00:49:44,828;other than
763;00:49:42,226;00:49:44,828;your miserable life?
764;00:49:44,862;00:49:46,964;What all free people want--
765;00:49:46,998;00:49:49,133;my freedom.
766;00:49:54,005;00:49:55,874;Well, you shall
766;00:49:54,005;00:49:55,874;have it, then.
767;00:49:58,143;00:50:00,745;But only if you
767;00:49:58,143;00:50:00,745;serve me well.
768;00:50:06,685;00:50:08,553;Ow.
768;00:50:06,685;00:50:08,553;Shh.
769;00:50:08,587;00:50:11,656;It's not deep.
769;00:50:08,587;00:50:11,656;I thought they were going to kill me.
770;00:50:11,690;00:50:13,224;They thought so, too.
771;00:50:13,258;00:50:15,894;He hated me,
771;00:50:13,258;00:50:15,894;the man who hit me.
772;00:50:15,928;00:50:18,496;I saw it in his eyes.
772;00:50:15,928;00:50:18,496;Hated me.
773;00:50:18,531;00:50:20,331;He never met me before,
774;00:50:20,366;00:50:23,334;but he wanted
774;00:50:20,366;00:50:23,334;to hurt me.
775;00:50:23,368;00:50:26,404;Of course he did.
775;00:50:23,368;00:50:26,404;Why? Why would a stranger--
776;00:50:26,438;00:50:28,706;you are everything
776;00:50:26,438;00:50:28,706;he will never have.
777;00:50:28,740;00:50:30,875;Your horse eats better
777;00:50:28,740;00:50:30,875;than his children.
778;00:50:30,909;00:50:34,245;It doesn't matter now.
778;00:50:30,909;00:50:34,245;He's dead.
779;00:50:34,279;00:50:37,148;I would have given them
779;00:50:34,279;00:50:37,148;bread if I had it.
780;00:50:37,183;00:50:39,784;I hate the King
780;00:50:37,183;00:50:39,784;more than any of them.
781;00:50:39,819;00:50:41,653;Don't say these things.
782;00:50:41,687;00:50:42,954;If the wrong
782;00:50:41,687;00:50:42,954;people hear you--
783;00:50:42,988;00:50:45,290;But you're not
783;00:50:42,988;00:50:45,290;the wrong people.
784;00:50:50,696;00:50:52,864;Don't trust anybody.
785;00:50:52,898;00:50:55,466;Life is safer
785;00:50:52,898;00:50:55,466;that way.
786;00:51:36,310;00:51:39,145;And where
786;00:51:36,310;00:51:39,145;are you going?
787;00:51:40,380;00:51:42,949;I have something for you
787;00:51:40,380;00:51:42,949;from Prince Theon.
788;00:51:42,983;00:51:45,818;What?
788;00:51:42,983;00:51:45,818;Me.
789;00:51:48,222;00:51:51,024;He says I'm to make
789;00:51:48,222;00:51:51,024;the rounds.
790;00:51:57,165;00:51:59,666;And keep you warm.
791;00:52:26,694;00:52:30,030;The Spice King refuses me
791;00:52:26,694;00:52:30,030;because I'm a bad investment.
792;00:52:30,064;00:52:31,706;The Silk King won't support me
793;00:52:31,731;00:52:33,731;because of his business with
793;00:52:31,731;00:52:33,731;the Lannisters.
794;00:52:33,734;00:52:35,702;Why offend
794;00:52:33,734;00:52:35,702;his best customer?
795;00:52:35,736;00:52:39,105;And the Copper King
795;00:52:35,736;00:52:39,105;offers me a single ship
796;00:52:39,139;00:52:42,508;on the condition that I lie
796;00:52:39,139;00:52:42,508;with him for a night.
797;00:52:42,542;00:52:45,510;Does he think I will
797;00:52:42,542;00:52:45,510;whore myself for a boat?
798;00:52:45,545;00:52:49,046;When I came to this city,
798;00:52:45,545;00:52:49,046;I had nothing.
799;00:52:49,081;00:52:51,582;Truly nothing.
800;00:52:51,616;00:52:53,684;I slept by the docks.
801;00:52:53,718;00:52:56,453;And when I could find work
801;00:52:53,718;00:52:56,453;loading the ships, I would eat.
802;00:52:56,488;00:52:59,523;If not,
802;00:52:56,488;00:52:59,523;I dreamed of food.
803;00:52:59,557;00:53:02,559;Today I am the richest
803;00:52:59,557;00:53:02,559;man in Qarth.
804;00:53:02,594;00:53:05,028;Do you think the path
804;00:53:02,594;00:53:05,028;from poverty to wealth
805;00:53:05,062;00:53:07,430;is always pure
805;00:53:05,062;00:53:07,430;and honorable?
806;00:53:07,464;00:53:11,100;I have done
806;00:53:07,464;00:53:11,100;many things, Khaleesi,
807;00:53:11,134;00:53:13,636;that a righteous man
807;00:53:11,134;00:53:13,636;would condemn.
808;00:53:13,670;00:53:17,240;And here I am,
808;00:53:13,670;00:53:17,240;with no regrets.
809;00:53:30,089;00:53:33,725;Bar the gates.
809;00:53:30,089;00:53:33,725;Ring the bells.
810;00:53:33,759;00:53:36,427;Slowly, Khaleesi.
811;00:53:45,870;00:53:48,137;Where are they?
