164;00:14:17,046;00:14:18,497;Inappropriate?
165;00:14:18,548;00:14:21,500;You're accused of killing the king.
165;00:14:18,548;00:14:21,500;Freeing you is treason.
166;00:14:21,551;00:14:23,418;Except I didn't do it.
167;00:14:23,469;00:14:25,470;Which is why
167;00:14:23,469;00:14:25,470;we're having a trial.
168;00:14:25,505;00:14:27,806;A trial.
169;00:14:27,840;00:14:30,592;If the killer threw himself
169;00:14:27,840;00:14:30,592;before the Iron Throne,
170;00:14:30,594;00:14:34,930;confessed to his crimes, and gave
170;00:14:30,594;00:14:34,930;irrefutable evidence of his guilt,
171;00:14:34,932;00:14:36,398;it wouldn't matter to Cersei.
172;00:14:36,432;00:14:39,434;She won't rest
172;00:14:36,432;00:14:39,434;until my head's on a spike.
173;00:14:39,436;00:14:41,603;Not just yours.
174;00:14:41,605;00:14:44,990;She's offering a knighthood
174;00:14:41,605;00:14:44,990;to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
175;00:14:45,024;00:14:46,608;Sansa couldn't have done this.
176;00:14:46,659;00:14:49,444;She had more reason than
176;00:14:46,659;00:14:49,444;anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.
177;00:14:49,446;00:14:51,947;Do you think it's a coincidence she
177;00:14:49,446;00:14:51,947;disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
178;00:14:51,998;00:14:54,282;No, but...
179;00:14:55,284;00:14:57,502;Sansa's not a killer.
180;00:14:59,789;00:15:01,173;Not yet, anyway.
181;00:15:01,207;00:15:04,760;—  (wood creaking)
181;00:15:01,207;00:15:04,760;—  (men shouting)

183;00:15:14,637;00:15:16,688;Where are you taking me?
184;00:15:16,722;00:15:18,890;I'm getting married
184;00:15:16,722;00:15:18,890;to your Aunt Lysa.
185;00:15:18,941;00:15:21,143;She's waiting for us
185;00:15:18,941;00:15:21,143;at the Eyrie.
186;00:15:21,194;00:15:23,979;You'll be safe there.
187;00:15:36,075;00:15:37,793;Did you kill Joffrey?
188;00:15:37,827;00:15:40,996;Did I kill Joffrey?
189;00:15:42,331;00:15:44,299;I've been in the Vale for weeks.
190;00:15:44,333;00:15:45,500;I know it was you.
191;00:15:45,502;00:15:49,471;And who helped me
191;00:15:45,502;00:15:49,471;with this conspiracy?
192;00:15:51,557;00:15:53,341;Well, there was Ser Dontos.
193;00:15:53,392;00:15:55,594;You used him to get
193;00:15:53,392;00:15:55,594;me out of King's Landing,
194;00:15:55,645;00:15:58,230;but you would never trust
194;00:15:55,645;00:15:58,230;him to kill the king.
195;00:15:58,347;00:16:01,900;— Why not? — Because you're too smart
195;00:15:58,347;00:16:01,900;to trust a drunk.
196;00:16:01,934;00:16:04,486;Then perhaps it was
196;00:16:01,934;00:16:04,486;your husband.
197;00:16:04,520;00:16:06,021;No.
198;00:16:06,072;00:16:07,823;How do you know?
199;00:16:07,857;00:16:10,492;I just do.
200;00:16:10,526;00:16:12,661;You're right.
201;00:16:12,695;00:16:15,163;He wasn't involved
201;00:16:12,695;00:16:15,163;in Joffrey's death.
202;00:16:15,198;00:16:17,199;But you were.
203;00:16:18,668;00:16:21,953;Do you remember that lovely
203;00:16:18,668;00:16:21,953;necklace Dontos gave you?
204;00:16:22,004;00:16:26,174;I don't suppose you noticed
204;00:16:22,004;00:16:26,174;that a stone was missing
205;00:16:26,209;00:16:28,460;after the feast.
206;00:16:28,511;00:16:31,046;The poison.
207;00:16:32,882;00:16:35,050;I don't understand.
208;00:16:35,101;00:16:37,686;The Lannisters gave you
208;00:16:35,101;00:16:37,686;wealth, power.
209;00:16:37,720;00:16:39,521;Joffrey made you
209;00:16:37,720;00:16:39,521;the Lord of Harrenhal.
210;00:16:39,555;00:16:42,390;A man with no motive
210;00:16:39,555;00:16:42,390;is a man no one suspects.
211;00:16:42,441;00:16:45,110;Always keep your foes confused.
212;00:16:45,144;00:16:48,063;If they don't know who
212;00:16:45,144;00:16:48,063;you are or what you want,
213;00:16:48,065;00:16:51,199;they can't know
213;00:16:48,065;00:16:51,199;what you plan to do next.
214;00:16:54,153;00:16:56,121;I don't believe you.
215;00:16:57,907;00:17:00,292;If they catch you, they'll
215;00:16:57,907;00:17:00,292;put your head on a spike
216;00:17:00,326;00:17:01,710;just like my father's.
217;00:17:01,744;00:17:04,913;You'd risk that
217;00:17:01,744;00:17:04,913;just to confuse them?
218;00:17:06,549;00:17:10,085;So many men,
218;00:17:06,549;00:17:10,085;they risk so little.
219;00:17:10,087;00:17:13,088;They spend their lives
219;00:17:10,087;00:17:13,088;avoiding danger.
220;00:17:13,139;00:17:15,557;And then they die.
221;00:17:16,842;00:17:20,645;I'd risk everything
221;00:17:16,842;00:17:20,645;to get what I want.
222;00:17:20,680;00:17:23,815;And what do you want?
223;00:17:29,772;00:17:31,356;Everything.
224;00:17:33,192;00:17:36,528;My friendship with the
224;00:17:33,192;00:17:36,528;Lannisters was productive.
225;00:17:36,579;00:17:39,281;But Joffrey,
226;00:17:39,283;00:17:41,833;a vicious boy with
226;00:17:39,283;00:17:41,833;a crown on his head,
227;00:17:41,867;00:17:44,119;is not a reliable ally.
228;00:17:44,170;00:17:46,121;And who could trust
228;00:17:44,170;00:17:46,121;a friend like that?
229;00:17:46,172;00:17:48,423;Who could trust you?
230;00:17:49,675;00:17:51,960;I don't want friends like me.
231;00:17:52,011;00:17:54,462;My new friends are predictable.
232;00:17:54,513;00:17:56,014;Very reasonable people.
233;00:17:56,048;00:17:58,767;As for what happened to Joffrey,
234;00:17:58,801;00:18:03,104;well, that was something my new
234;00:17:58,801;00:18:03,104;friends wanted very badly.
235;00:18:03,139;00:18:05,607;Nothing like a thoughtful gift
236;00:18:05,641;00:18:08,226;to make a new friendship
236;00:18:05,641;00:18:08,226;grow strong.
237;00:18:08,277;00:18:10,145;I can't believe you're going.
238;00:18:10,196;00:18:12,814;Leaving me alone here
238;00:18:10,196;00:18:12,814;with these people.
239;00:18:12,816;00:18:15,150;The time has come, my dear.
240;00:18:15,201;00:18:18,236;There's nothing
240;00:18:15,201;00:18:18,236;more tedious than a trial.
241;00:18:18,287;00:18:20,739;Except perhaps these gardens.
242;00:18:20,790;00:18:23,491;If I have to take one
242;00:18:20,790;00:18:23,491;more leisurely stroll
243;00:18:23,542;00:18:26,745;through these gardens, I'll
243;00:18:23,542;00:18:26,745;fling myself from the cliffs.
244;00:18:26,796;00:18:28,296;(Margaery laughs)
245;00:18:28,331;00:18:30,298;Have you been to see Tommen yet?
246;00:18:30,333;00:18:32,300;No.
247;00:18:32,335;00:18:34,252;Have they even agreed
247;00:18:32,335;00:18:34,252;to the match?
248;00:18:34,303;00:18:36,004;No one tells me anything.
249;00:18:36,055;00:18:40,258;I wasn't originally meant to marry
249;00:18:36,055;00:18:40,258;your grandfather Luthor, you know.
250;00:18:40,309;00:18:42,677;He was engaged to my sister,
251;00:18:42,679;00:18:44,846;your great-aunt Viola.
252;00:18:44,897;00:18:48,149;I was to be given to
252;00:18:44,897;00:18:48,149;some Targaryen or other.
253;00:18:48,184;00:18:51,903;Marrying a Targaryen
253;00:18:48,184;00:18:51,903;was all the rage back then.
254;00:18:51,937;00:18:54,489;But the moment
254;00:18:51,937;00:18:54,489;I saw my intended,
255;00:18:54,523;00:18:57,859;with his twitchy
255;00:18:54,523;00:18:57,859;little ferret's face
256;00:18:57,910;00:18:59,861;and ludicrous silver hair,
257;00:18:59,863;00:19:01,913;I knew he wouldn't do.
258;00:19:01,947;00:19:04,499;So the evening
259;00:19:04,533;00:19:07,585;before Luthor was
259;00:19:04,533;00:19:07,585;to propose to my sister,
260;00:19:07,620;00:19:10,288;I got lost on my way back
260;00:19:07,620;00:19:10,288;from my embroidery lesson
261;00:19:10,339;00:19:12,624;and happened upon his chamber.
262;00:19:12,675;00:19:13,875;(laughs)
263;00:19:13,877;00:19:16,211;— How absent-minded of me.
263;00:19:13,877;00:19:16,211;— Mm-mmh.
264;00:19:16,262;00:19:20,432;The following morning, Luthor
264;00:19:16,262;00:19:20,432;never made it down the stairs
265;00:19:20,466;00:19:24,219;to propose to my sister 'cause
265;00:19:20,466;00:19:24,219;the boy couldn't bloody walk.
266;00:19:24,221;00:19:26,554;And once he could,
266;00:19:24,221;00:19:26,554;the only thing he wanted
267;00:19:26,556;00:19:28,973;was what I'd given him
267;00:19:26,556;00:19:28,973;the night before.
268;00:19:29,025;00:19:31,192;I was good.
269;00:19:31,227;00:19:33,895;I was very, very good.
270;00:19:35,731;00:19:38,366;You are even better.
271;00:19:38,401;00:19:39,984;But you need to act quickly.
272;00:19:40,036;00:19:43,872;Cersei may be vicious,
272;00:19:40,036;00:19:43,872;but she's not stupid.
273;00:19:43,906;00:19:46,791;She'll turn the boy against
273;00:19:43,906;00:19:46,791;you as soon as she can.
274;00:19:46,826;00:19:50,128;And by the time you're
274;00:19:46,826;00:19:50,128;married, it'll be too late.
275;00:19:50,162;00:19:52,130;Luckily for you,
275;00:19:50,162;00:19:52,130;the Queen Regent
276;00:19:52,164;00:19:53,998;is rather distracted
276;00:19:52,164;00:19:53,998;at the moment,
277;00:19:54,050;00:19:56,468;mourning her dear departed boy.
278;00:19:56,502;00:19:58,887;Accusing her brother
278;00:19:56,502;00:19:58,887;of his murder,
279;00:19:58,921;00:20:00,889;which he didn't commit.
280;00:20:00,923;00:20:02,057;Well, he could have done.
281;00:20:02,091;00:20:04,008;He could have done,
281;00:20:02,091;00:20:04,008;but he didn't.
282;00:20:04,060;00:20:07,062;— You don't know, Grandmother.
282;00:20:04,060;00:20:07,062;— But I do know.
283;00:20:07,096;00:20:11,683;You don't think I'd let you
283;00:20:07,096;00:20:11,683;marry that beast, do you?
284;00:20:12,768;00:20:15,770;What?
284;00:20:12,768;00:20:15,770;I don't understand.
285;00:20:15,821;00:20:19,441;Shh. Don't you worry
285;00:20:15,821;00:20:19,441;yourself about all that.
286;00:20:21,744;00:20:24,112;You just do
286;00:20:21,744;00:20:24,112;what needs to be done.
287;00:20:25,581;00:20:27,582;Jon:
287;00:20:25,581;00:20:27,582;Bring it through!

289;00:20:34,924;00:20:37,208;And again.
290;00:20:42,681;00:20:46,468;— (laughs)
290;00:20:42,681;00:20:46,468;— Very nice. Good.
291;00:20:46,470;00:20:49,137;A lot of wildlings fight
291;00:20:46,470;00:20:49,137;with a weapon in each hand.
292;00:20:49,188;00:20:52,190;First thing you want to do
293;00:20:52,274;00:20:54,976;is disarm them to try
293;00:20:52,274;00:20:54,976;and even the odds.
294;00:21:08,707;00:21:10,458;Let's see what you can do.
295;00:21:12,328;00:21:14,162;Olly, you just watch for now.
296;00:21:14,164;00:21:15,246;I can fight.
297;00:21:15,297;00:21:17,332;Have you ever
297;00:21:15,297;00:21:17,332;held a sword before?
298;00:21:17,383;00:21:19,417;I was the best archer

373;00:25:37,927;00:25:40,928;You know why. She'd hoped I'd
373;00:25:37,927;00:25:40,928;send her daughters back to her.
374;00:25:45,984;00:25:47,935;She hoped or did you promise?
375;00:25:47,937;00:25:49,771;I swore by all the gods

376;00:25:49,822;00:25:52,273;alive, I'd return them to her.
377;00:25:52,357;00:25:54,242;So you made a sacred vow

386;00:26:15,214;00:26:17,448;would you do it?
387;00:26:21,970;00:26:24,238;I know you went to see Tyrion.

456;00:31:08,890;00:31:12,176;It's the duty of the Lord
456;00:31:08,890;00:31:12,176;Commander to fill those pages.
457;00:31:15,347;00:31:18,149;And there's still room
457;00:31:15,347;00:31:18,149;left on mine.

459;00:31:50,849;00:31:53,300;Mmm.
460;00:31:53,351;00:31:54,635;It's yours.
461;00:31:54,686;00:31:56,303;I can't accept this.
462;00:31:56,354;00:31:58,639;It was reforged
462;00:31:56,354;00:31:58,639;from Ned Stark's sword.
463;00:31:58,690;00:32:01,809;You'll use it to defend
463;00:31:58,690;00:32:01,809;Ned Stark's daughter.
464;00:32:03,395;00:32:07,364;You swore an oath to return the

466;00:32:09,818;00:32:11,735;Arya's probably dead, too,
467;00:32:11,787;00:32:14,955;but there's still a chance to find
467;00:32:11,787;00:32:14,955;Sansa and get her somewhere safe.
468;00:32:16,241;00:32:17,908;I've got something else for you.
469;00:32:36,561;00:32:39,063;I hope I got

470;00:32:41,683;00:32:43,350;I'll find her.

478;00:33:14,382;00:33:16,717;My brother owes him a debt.
478;00:33:14,382;00:33:16,717;He's not safe here.
479;00:33:16,719;00:33:19,270;You're keeping him from harm.
479;00:33:16,719;00:33:19,270;It's chivalry.
480;00:33:19,304;00:33:22,356;I won't slow you down, ser–

483;00:33:28,363;00:33:31,649;See? He's a good lad.
483;00:33:28,363;00:33:31,649;You'll get along.

487;00:33:50,085;00:33:52,303;Ready the lady's horse.
488;00:34:01,596;00:34:04,064;They say the best swords
488;00:34:01,596;00:34:04,064;have names.
489;00:34:04,099;00:34:05,516;Any ideas?

493;00:35:17,005;00:35:19,390;have taken her away.
494;00:35:19,424;00:35:22,559;— She wasn't safe here.
494;00:35:19,424;00:35:22,559;— She's not safe out there.
495;00:35:22,594;00:35:24,428;I should have known.
496;00:35:24,479;00:35:26,647;You told us there were
496;00:35:24,479;00:35:26,647;wildlings south of the Wall.
497;00:35:26,681;00:35:29,433;If they're raiding the smaller
497;00:35:26,681;00:35:29,433;villages, Mole's Town could be next.
498;00:35:29,484;00:35:32,853;— Castle Black could be next.
498;00:35:29,484;00:35:32,853;— I should go back for Gilly.
499;00:35:32,855;00:35:34,488;We have orders. No one's
499;00:35:32,855;00:35:34,488;to leave the castle.
500;00:35:34,522;00:35:37,024;I remember when you disobeyed
500;00:35:34,522;00:35:37,024;orders and rode south to help Robb.
501;00:35:37,026;00:35:39,243;And I remember who came after
501;00:35:37,026;00:35:39,243;me and brought me home.
502;00:35:41,863;00:35:44,732;I know how hard
502;00:35:41,863;00:35:44,732;it is, Sam, believe me.
503;00:35:46,868;00:35:49,586;When you told me about Bran

504;00:35:49,621;00:35:53,007;all I could think about was getting my
504;00:35:49,621;00:35:53,007;strength back so I could go and find him.
505;00:35:54,376;00:35:56,877;I wish I could have convinced
505;00:35:54,376;00:35:56,877;him to come back with me.
506;00:35:58,513;00:36:01,181;I tried.
506;00:35:58,513;00:36:01,181;Really, I did.
507;00:36:03,468;00:36:05,719;How fast could they travel?

508;00:36:05,770;00:36:09,223;on a sledge by a simpleton?
509;00:36:09,274;00:36:10,808;I don't know.
510;00:36:10,859;00:36:13,060;They'd pass wildling villages.
511;00:36:13,111;00:36:16,146;They could try to find
511;00:36:13,111;00:36:16,146;shelter at one of them.
