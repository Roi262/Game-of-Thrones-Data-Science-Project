3;00:02:39,935;00:02:41,769;He was a good man.
4;00:02:41,804;00:02:45,189;Barristan the Bold
4;00:02:41,804;00:02:45,189;they called him.
5;00:02:45,224;00:02:48,261;He crossed a continent
5;00:02:45,224;00:02:48,261;to serve me.
6;00:02:48,295;00:02:50,797;He was a loyal friend.
7;00:02:52,549;00:02:54,968;And he died in an alley,
8;00:02:55,019;00:02:58,054;butchered by cowards
8;00:02:55,019;00:02:58,054;who hide behind masks.
9;00:03:00,691;00:03:03,309;We could pull back
9;00:03:00,691;00:03:03,309;to the pyramid district,
10;00:03:03,311;00:03:06,646;secure it, and use it as a
10;00:03:03,311;00:03:06,646;base from which to operate.
11;00:03:06,648;00:03:09,816;Then we clean the city out,
12;00:03:09,867;00:03:13,720;neighborhood by neighborhood,

13;00:03:13,754;00:03:16,022;until the rats
13;00:03:13,754;00:03:16,022;have nowhere left to hide.
14;00:03:19,877;00:03:22,495;I prefer
14;00:03:19,877;00:03:22,495;your earlier suggestion.
15;00:03:22,497;00:03:26,332;Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's
15;00:03:22,497;00:03:26,332;great families and bring them to me.
16;00:03:27,835;00:03:31,587;But I'm the leader of my family.
17;00:03:33,725;00:03:35,146;No, Your Grace!
18;00:03:35,592;00:03:38,227;I had nothing to do with this.
19;00:03:38,262;00:03:40,179;Your Grace!

32;00:06:16,587;00:06:18,504;Tomorrow perhaps.
33;00:06:54,675;00:06:57,960;And though Daenerys maintains
33;00:06:54,675;00:06:57,960;her grip on Slaver's Bay,
34;00:06:58,011;00:07:01,430;forces rise against her
34;00:06:58,011;00:07:01,430;from within and without.
35;00:07:01,465;00:07:03,549;She refuses to leave
35;00:07:01,465;00:07:03,549;until the freedom
36;00:07:03,600;00:07:06,385;of the former slaves
36;00:07:03,600;00:07:06,385;is secure.
37;00:07:07,721;00:07:09,472;She sounds like quite a woman.
38;00:07:09,523;00:07:11,390;And she's alone,
39;00:07:11,441;00:07:13,025;under siege,
40;00:07:13,060;00:07:16,445;no family to guide her
40;00:07:13,060;00:07:16,445;or protect her.

43;00:07:25,706;00:07:28,407;Don't say that, Maester Aemon.
44;00:07:28,492;00:07:33,496;A Targaryen alone in the world
45;00:07:33,547;00:07:36,082;is a terrible thing.
46;00:07:38,969;00:07:40,803;Maester Aemon.
47;00:07:40,837;00:07:43,089;Lord Commander.
48;00:07:43,140;00:07:46,092;Sam, I'd like to speak
48;00:07:43,140;00:07:46,092;to the maester alone.
49;00:08:01,441;00:08:03,109;How are you feeling?
50;00:08:03,160;00:08:05,778;Oh, like
50;00:08:03,160;00:08:05,778;a hundred-year-old man
51;00:08:05,829;00:08:08,247;slowly freezing to death.
52;00:08:12,502;00:08:15,421;I need your advice.
53;00:08:15,455;00:08:18,007;There's something I want
53;00:08:15,455;00:08:18,007;to do, something I...
54;00:08:18,041;00:08:19,458;have to do.
55;00:08:19,509;00:08:21,911;But it'll divide
55;00:08:19,509;00:08:21,911;the Night's Watch.
56;00:08:21,945;00:08:23,547;Bitterly.
57;00:08:23,796;00:08:26,301;Half the men will hate me
57;00:08:23,796;00:08:26,301;the moment I give the order.
58;00:08:27,008;00:08:30,643;Half the men hate you
58;00:08:27,008;00:08:30,643;already, Lord Commander.
59;00:08:30,677;00:08:32,728;Do it.
60;00:08:32,762;00:08:34,591;But you don't know what it is.
61;00:08:34,711;00:08:36,415;That doesn't matter.
62;00:08:36,450;00:08:37,818;You do.
63;00:08:40,604;00:08:44,657;You will find little joy
63;00:08:40,604;00:08:44,657;in your command.
64;00:08:44,691;00:08:47,243;But with luck,
65;00:08:47,277;00:08:50,839;you will find the strength
65;00:08:47,277;00:08:50,839;to do what needs to be done.
66;00:08:52,854;00:08:56,452;Kill the boy, Jon Snow.
67;00:08:56,503;00:09:00,005;Winter is almost upon us.
68;00:09:00,040;00:09:02,791;Kill the boy
69;00:09:02,843;00:09:05,911;and let the man be born.
70;00:09:14,855;00:09:17,356;Where are the rest
70;00:09:14,855;00:09:17,356;of the free folk now?
71;00:09:17,390;00:09:19,191;Where have they gone?
72;00:09:23,597;00:09:25,664;Who leads them?
73;00:09:25,699;00:09:28,167;They followed Mance.
74;00:09:28,201;00:09:30,591;They won't follow anyone else.
75;00:09:33,384;00:09:35,452;What about you?
76;00:09:36,855;00:09:39,389;Hard to lead
76;00:09:36,855;00:09:39,389;when you're in chains.
77;00:09:42,977;00:09:44,678;What if I unchained you?
78;00:09:44,729;00:09:46,045;Why would you do that?
79;00:09:47,782;00:09:50,684;Because you are not my enemy.
80;00:09:50,735;00:09:52,402;And I'm not yours.
81;00:09:52,437;00:09:55,322;You sure seemed like my enemy
81;00:09:52,437;00:09:55,322;when you were killing my friends.
82;00:09:55,356;00:09:58,108;For 8,000 years the Night's
82;00:09:55,356;00:09:58,108;Watch have sworn an oath
83;00:09:58,159;00:10:01,159;to be the shield that
83;00:09:58,159;00:10:01,159;guards the realms of men.
84;00:10:02,130;00:10:05,332;And for 8,000 years we've
84;00:10:02,130;00:10:05,332;fallen short of that oath.
85;00:10:05,366;00:10:08,452;You belong to the realms of men.
86;00:10:08,486;00:10:10,454;All of you.
87;00:10:10,456;00:10:13,290;And now everything
87;00:10:10,456;00:10:13,290;is going to change?
88;00:10:13,292;00:10:15,292;It is.
88;00:10:13,292;00:10:15,292;Why now?
89;00:10:15,343;00:10:19,346;Because now I am Lord Commander
89;00:10:15,343;00:10:19,346;of the Night's Watch.
90;00:10:19,380;00:10:22,516;What would you have me do,
91;00:10:22,550;00:10:24,968;Lord Commander?
92;00:10:26,638;00:10:28,722;I'd have you go
92;00:10:26,638;00:10:28,722;north of the Wall.
93;00:10:28,773;00:10:32,559;Gather the remaining free folk wherever
93;00:10:28,773;00:10:32,559;they are and bring them back here.
94;00:10:32,610;00:10:36,146;I'll open the gates for
94;00:10:32,610;00:10:36,146;them and let them through.
95;00:10:36,197;00:10:39,283;I'll find them lands to
95;00:10:36,197;00:10:39,283;settle south of the Wall.
96;00:10:39,317;00:10:42,903;They won't kneel for you
96;00:10:39,317;00:10:42,903;and neither will I.
97;00:10:42,954;00:10:45,822;I don't want them
97;00:10:42,954;00:10:45,822;to kneel for me.
98;00:10:45,824;00:10:48,325;I want them to fight with
98;00:10:45,824;00:10:48,325;me when the time comes.
99;00:10:48,327;00:10:51,128;The day I ask my people
99;00:10:48,327;00:10:51,128;to fight with the crows
100;00:10:51,162;00:10:54,081;is the day my people
100;00:10:51,162;00:10:54,081;cut my guts from my belly
101;00:10:54,132;00:10:55,165;and make me eat them.
102;00:10:55,216;00:10:58,135;And how many of your
102;00:10:55,216;00:10:58,135;people can't fight?
103;00:10:58,169;00:11:01,255;The women, the children,
103;00:10:58,169;00:11:01,255;the old, the sick--
104;00:11:01,306;00:11:03,140;what happens to them?
105;00:11:03,174;00:11:05,225;You're condemning them to death.
106;00:11:05,260;00:11:09,046;Worse than death because you're
106;00:11:05,260;00:11:09,046;too proud to make peace.
107;00:11:12,483;00:11:14,585;Or maybe you're not proud.
108;00:11:16,521;00:11:18,105;Maybe you're just a coward.
109;00:11:25,029;00:11:28,115;Easy thing to say
109;00:11:25,029;00:11:28,115;to a man in chains.
110;00:11:52,607;00:11:54,274;Your people need a leader.
111;00:11:54,309;00:11:57,561;And they need to get south of
111;00:11:54,309;00:11:57,561;the Wall before it's too late.
112;00:11:57,563;00:11:59,696;We don't have much time
112;00:11:57,563;00:11:59,696;and they have less.
113;00:11:59,731;00:12:02,649;The walkers are coming and
113;00:11:59,731;00:12:02,649;they'll hit your people first.
114;00:12:04,402;00:12:07,237;I'm not asking you to make
114;00:12:04,402;00:12:07,237;peace to save your skin.
115;00:12:07,288;00:12:11,074;Make peace to save your people.
116;00:12:19,500;00:12:21,752;Most of them are at Hardhome.
117;00:12:21,786;00:12:23,086;You know where that is?
118;00:12:23,088;00:12:24,972;Up on Storrold's Point.
119;00:12:25,006;00:12:27,174;I can give you 10 horses
119;00:12:25,006;00:12:27,174;and nine other men.
120;00:12:27,225;00:12:29,105;You can get there in a week.
121;00:12:29,143;00:12:30,761;We'll need ships.
122;00:12:32,230;00:12:34,765;I'll talk to King Stannis
122;00:12:32,230;00:12:34,765;about lending you his fleet.
123;00:12:38,152;00:12:39,736;All right, then.
124;00:12:41,539;00:12:43,774;You're coming with me.
125;00:12:44,675;00:12:47,444;You're the Lord Commander
125;00:12:44,675;00:12:47,444;of the Night's Watch.
126;00:12:47,495;00:12:49,780;They need to hear it from you.
127;00:12:49,782;00:12:52,082;They need to know
127;00:12:49,782;00:12:52,082;the ships they are boarding
128;00:12:52,116;00:12:54,334;won't be torched
128;00:12:52,116;00:12:54,334;in the middle of the sea.
129;00:12:54,369;00:12:59,539;You come with me or I don't go.
130;00:13:07,466;00:13:10,267;You'd bring wildlings here
130;00:13:07,466;00:13:10,267;through our gates?
131;00:13:10,301;00:13:13,804;Men, women, and children will die
131;00:13:10,301;00:13:13,804;by the thousands if we do nothing.
132;00:13:13,855;00:13:17,057;Let them die. We got our
132;00:13:13,855;00:13:17,057;own to worry about.
133;00:13:17,108;00:13:20,060;Less enemies for us.
134;00:13:20,111;00:13:21,812;Fewer.
135;00:13:21,863;00:13:24,581;What?
135;00:13:21,863;00:13:24,581;Nothing.
136;00:13:24,615;00:13:28,452;Look, well, there is
136;00:13:24,615;00:13:28,452;good farmland in the Gift.
137;00:13:28,486;00:13:30,821;Land that no one uses now.
138;00:13:30,823;00:13:32,873;A dozen abandoned villages.
139;00:13:32,907;00:13:35,042;And why do you think the farmers
139;00:13:32,907;00:13:35,042;abandoned those villages?
140;00:13:35,076;00:13:38,355;Because the wildlings
140;00:13:35,076;00:13:38,355;raided them for years.
141;00:13:38,791;00:13:39,925;Cut them down!
142;00:13:40,486;00:13:42,168;Just like they did this boy's people.
143;00:13:42,820;00:13:45,105;Aye!
144;00:13:45,156;00:13:48,775;We've been fighting
144;00:13:45,156;00:13:48,775;them for thousands of years.
145;00:13:48,826;00:13:50,860;They've slaughtered villages.
146;00:13:50,862;00:13:52,892;They've slaughtered
146;00:13:50,862;00:13:52,892;our brothers.
147;00:13:53,012;00:13:55,165;And we've slaughtered theirs.
148;00:13:56,701;00:14:00,475;I will follow you
148;00:13:56,701;00:14:00,475;anywhere, you know that.
149;00:14:01,783;00:14:04,540;But they killed Grenn.
149;00:14:01,783;00:14:04,540;Yes.
150;00:14:04,541;00:14:06,608;And they killed Pyp.
150;00:14:04,541;00:14:06,608;Aye.
151;00:14:06,728;00:14:09,367;They killed 50 of our brothers.
152;00:14:09,487;00:14:11,798;I can't forget that.
153;00:14:11,849;00:14:12,967;I can't forgive it.
154;00:14:13,087;00:14:15,210;You were at the Fist
154;00:14:13,087;00:14:15,210;of the First Men.
155;00:14:15,771;00:14:18,474;If we abandon them,
155;00:14:15,771;00:14:18,474;you know what they become.
156;00:14:18,594;00:14:20,634;We can learn to live
156;00:14:18,594;00:14:20,634;with the wildlings
157;00:14:20,754;00:14:23,610;or we can add them
157;00:14:20,754;00:14:23,610;to the army of the dead.
158;00:14:23,644;00:14:28,031;Whatever they are now,
158;00:14:23,644;00:14:28,031;they're better than that.
159;00:14:55,891;00:14:57,759;Thank you.
160;00:14:57,810;00:14:59,427;Olly.
161;00:15:01,197;00:15:04,099;If you have something
161;00:15:01,197;00:15:04,099;you want to say to me,
162;00:15:04,101;00:15:05,817;say it.
163;00:15:12,575;00:15:14,609;It's all right.
164;00:15:16,028;00:15:18,113;You don't mean it, do you?
165;00:15:19,749;00:15:22,367;Telling the wildlings
165;00:15:19,749;00:15:22,367;you want to make peace.
166;00:15:22,418;00:15:24,402;You're just doing it
166;00:15:22,418;00:15:24,402;to trick them.
167;00:15:24,437;00:15:25,954;It's not a trick.
168;00:15:26,005;00:15:27,539;They burned my village.
169;00:15:27,590;00:15:29,624;They put an arrow
169;00:15:27,590;00:15:29,624;through my father's head
170;00:15:29,626;00:15:30,826;right in front of me.
171;00:15:30,946;00:15:34,496;They butchered my mother,
171;00:15:30,946;00:15:34,496;everyone I ever knew.
172;00:15:42,254;00:15:45,190;I know what it's like
172;00:15:42,254;00:15:45,190;to lose the people you love.
173;00:15:47,309;00:15:49,611;I know this is hard for you.
174;00:15:51,147;00:15:53,982;But winter is coming.
175;00:15:53,984;00:15:57,519;We know what's coming with it.
176;00:15:57,553;00:15:59,454;We can't face it alone.
177;00:16:04,877;00:16:07,879;Will there be anything else
177;00:16:04,877;00:16:07,879;you need, Lord Commander?
178;00:16:11,117;00:16:12,717;No.
179;00:16:46,202;00:16:48,570;She's far away
179;00:16:46,202;00:16:48,570;from the Lannisters.
180;00:16:49,438;00:16:51,039;This is her home.
181;00:16:54,192;00:16:56,310;Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.
182;00:16:57,562;00:16:59,947;Better off with the Boltons
183;00:16:59,981;00:17:02,650;who murdered
183;00:16:59,981;00:17:02,650;her mother and brother?
184;00:17:11,243;00:17:14,044;Sansa's in danger even
184;00:17:11,243;00:17:14,044;if she doesn't realize it.
185;00:17:28,143;00:17:29,894;Thank you.
186;00:17:31,813;00:17:34,094;You've lived here a long time?
187;00:17:35,350;00:17:37,067;Aye.
188;00:17:37,102;00:17:39,820;Did you know Lord Eddard?
189;00:17:41,409;00:17:44,024;I knew him
190;00:17:44,026;00:17:46,577;and his father before him.
191;00:17:48,330;00:17:50,698;The Starks are gone now.
192;00:17:50,732;00:17:52,533;Not all of them.
193;00:17:52,584;00:17:55,369;I know who's inside that castle.
194;00:17:55,420;00:17:57,288;Everyone knows.
195;00:17:57,339;00:17:58,772;The Boltons.
196;00:17:58,807;00:18:01,167;I'm not talking
196;00:17:58,807;00:18:01,167;about the Boltons.
197;00:18:02,074;00:18:04,795;I need to get a message to her.
198;00:18:04,846;00:18:06,680;To Sansa Stark.
199;00:18:08,750;00:18:10,010;Who are you?
200;00:18:10,130;00:18:13,220;Someone who swore
200;00:18:10,130;00:18:13,220;to keep her safe.
201;00:18:13,222;00:18:15,022;Swore to who?
202;00:18:15,056;00:18:17,224;Her mother.
203;00:18:17,259;00:18:19,143;Her mother's dead.
204;00:18:19,194;00:18:21,946;That doesn't release me
204;00:18:19,194;00:18:21,946;from an oath.
205;00:18:24,616;00:18:27,568;I served Lady Catelyn.
206;00:18:27,570;00:18:30,204;I serve her still.
207;00:18:31,706;00:18:33,674;Who do you serve?
208;00:18:40,048;00:18:42,166;Come back here.
209;00:18:45,870;00:18:47,054;Myranda.
210;00:18:47,088;00:18:49,156;I saw you staring at her.
211;00:18:49,190;00:18:50,891;I'm going to marry her.
212;00:18:50,925;00:18:54,011;That will involve looking
212;00:18:50,925;00:18:54,011;at her from time to time.
213;00:18:57,599;00:18:59,350;You said you'd marry me.
214;00:19:00,568;00:19:02,269;And I meant it.
215;00:19:02,304;00:19:04,405;When I was a bastard named Snow.
216;00:19:04,439;00:19:06,690;But I'm a Bolton now.
217;00:19:06,741;00:19:10,878;What I want is no longer
217;00:19:06,741;00:19:10,878;the primary consideration.
218;00:19:10,912;00:19:13,280;I'm furthering a dynasty.
219;00:19:16,284;00:19:17,618;Do you think she's pretty?
220;00:19:17,669;00:19:20,354;Of course I do.
221;00:19:20,388;00:19:21,789;I'm not blind.
222;00:19:34,936;00:19:37,187;You think she's pretty, too.
223;00:19:40,275;00:19:42,476;I'm looking forward
223;00:19:40,275;00:19:42,476;to our wedding night.
224;00:19:42,527;00:19:46,313;But don't worry, I'll have
224;00:19:42,527;00:19:46,313;plenty of time for you.
225;00:19:46,315;00:19:48,899;Perhaps I'll marry, too.
226;00:19:53,788;00:19:56,907;You're the kennel
226;00:19:53,788;00:19:56,907;master's daughter.
227;00:19:56,958;00:20:00,160;Who are you going to marry,
227;00:19:56,958;00:20:00,160;the stable keeper's son?
228;00:20:06,384;00:20:08,335;You're mine.
229;00:20:08,977;00:20:11,388;You're not going anywhere.
230;00:20:11,423;00:20:13,343;Unless I have to listen
230;00:20:11,423;00:20:13,343;to more of your jealousy.
231;00:20:13,459;00:20:16,977;Jealousy bores me. You remember
231;00:20:13,459;00:20:16,977;what happens to people who bore me.
232;00:20:19,681;00:20:23,600;You're not going to bore
232;00:20:19,681;00:20:23,600;me, are you, Myranda?
233;00:20:42,036;00:20:43,620;Never.
234;00:21:10,448;00:21:12,116;Beg pardon, my lady.
235;00:21:12,150;00:21:14,485;I've come to refill
235;00:21:12,150;00:21:14,485;the wash basin.
236;00:21:14,536;00:21:16,403;Oh, I don't need--
237;00:21:17,572;00:21:19,957;You still have
237;00:21:17,572;00:21:19,957;friends in the North.
238;00:21:19,991;00:21:21,620;If you're ever in trouble,
239;00:21:21,740;00:21:25,629;light a candle in the highest
239;00:21:21,740;00:21:25,629;window of the broken tower.
240;00:21:26,571;00:21:29,249;But who--
240;00:21:26,571;00:21:29,249;You're not alone.
241;00:22:07,005;00:22:09,256;I like your dress.
242;00:22:10,579;00:22:12,426;Who made it for you?
243;00:22:12,460;00:22:15,095;I made it myself.
244;00:22:15,129;00:22:17,130;Really?
245;00:22:19,133;00:22:20,851;Who-- who are you?
246;00:22:20,885;00:22:23,936;I'm Myranda, the kennel
246;00:22:20,885;00:22:23,936;master's daughter.
247;00:22:27,358;00:22:28,642;May I?
248;00:22:35,033;00:22:36,783;Oh, wonderful.
249;00:22:36,818;00:22:38,819;The stitching.
250;00:22:40,154;00:22:42,256;Who taught you?
250;00:22:40,154;00:22:42,256;My mother.
251;00:22:43,352;00:22:47,377;I'm sorry for what
251;00:22:43,352;00:22:47,377;happened to her.
252;00:22:47,412;00:22:48,712;Thank you.
253;00:22:50,498;00:22:52,666;It's good that she taught you.
254;00:22:52,668;00:22:54,167;It was a gift.
255;00:22:54,219;00:22:59,172;Now every time you wear
255;00:22:54,219;00:22:59,172;something you made,
256;00:22:59,174;00:23:01,008;you can remember her.
257;00:23:01,010;00:23:02,543;I'd rather have a mother.
258;00:23:02,577;00:23:06,313;I know.
258;00:23:02,577;00:23:06,313;It's not the same.
259;00:23:06,347;00:23:09,592;Still, it's good to remember.
260;00:23:09,816;00:23:12,236;Remember the way things were.
261;00:23:13,988;00:23:16,490;I almost forgot.
262;00:23:16,524;00:23:19,359;There's something else
263;00:23:19,410;00:23:21,778;to help you remember.
264;00:23:31,256;00:23:33,707;Down there at the end.
265;00:23:35,043;00:23:36,426;What is it?
266;00:23:36,461;00:23:38,378;That would spoil the surprise.
267;00:23:39,468;00:23:42,799;Go ahead, it's perfectly safe.
268;00:23:42,850;00:23:45,018;You won't believe it
268;00:23:42,850;00:23:45,018;when you see it.
269;00:24:47,548;00:24:48,915;Theon?
270;00:24:58,843;00:25:01,211;You shouldn't be here.
271;00:25:21,315;00:25:25,285;You smell particularly
271;00:25:21,315;00:25:25,285;ripe this evening.
272;00:25:27,608;00:25:29,873;Pour me some wine.
273;00:25:54,015;00:25:56,183;Do you have
273;00:25:54,015;00:25:56,183;something to tell me?
274;00:25:57,518;00:25:58,830;No, my lord.
275;00:25:58,950;00:26:00,854;Reek.
276;00:26:04,792;00:26:06,693;She saw me.
277;00:26:06,695;00:26:08,195;Who?
278;00:26:08,246;00:26:11,081;Sansa.
278;00:26:08,246;00:26:11,081;Lady Sansa.
279;00:26:11,115;00:26:12,783;She came to the kennels.
280;00:26:13,979;00:26:15,229;She saw you?
281;00:26:15,280;00:26:17,481;Yes.
281;00:26:15,280;00:26:17,481;I'm sorry, master.
282;00:26:17,532;00:26:19,400;Forgive me.
282;00:26:17,532;00:26:19,400;I didn't think--
283;00:26:19,451;00:26:21,402;Come here.
284;00:26:29,661;00:26:32,463;You mustn't keep
284;00:26:29,661;00:26:32,463;secrets from me, Reek.
285;00:26:32,497;00:26:34,331;Get on your knees.
286;00:26:46,845;00:26:48,762;Give me your hand.
287;00:27:10,869;00:27:12,703;I forgive you.
288;00:27:23,882;00:27:27,017;I trust you find your
288;00:27:23,882;00:27:27,017;chamber suitable, my lady.
289;00:27:27,052;00:27:29,219;Yes, thank you, my lord.
290;00:27:29,221;00:27:31,055;Allow me.
291;00:27:34,859;00:27:36,477;Mother.
292;00:27:36,528;00:27:38,445;Thank you, Ramsay.
293;00:27:48,573;00:27:53,210;My lady, we are all a
293;00:27:48,573;00:27:53,210;family, we northerners.
294;00:27:53,244;00:27:56,664;Our blood ties go back
294;00:27:53,244;00:27:56,664;thousands of years.
295;00:27:56,715;00:27:59,683;So I'd like to drink
295;00:27:56,715;00:27:59,683;to our wedding.
296;00:27:59,718;00:28:03,087;May our happiness
296;00:27:59,718;00:28:03,087;spread from Moat Cailin
297;00:28:03,089;00:28:04,254;to the Last Hearth.
298;00:28:04,306;00:28:06,223;To your wedding.
299;00:28:06,257;00:28:08,175;To your wedding.
300;00:28:14,733;00:28:18,068;It must be difficult for you
300;00:28:14,733;00:28:18,068;being in a strange place.
301;00:28:18,103;00:28:20,938;This isn't a strange place.
301;00:28:18,103;00:28:20,938;This is my home.
302;00:28:20,940;00:28:23,221;It's the people who are strange.
303;00:28:27,529;00:28:29,330;You're right.
304;00:28:29,364;00:28:30,914;Very strange.
305;00:28:34,119;00:28:35,753;More wine, please.
306;00:28:42,260;00:28:44,979;I heard you two had reunited.
307;00:28:45,013;00:28:48,048;A fitting place for it.
308;00:28:49,968;00:28:53,303;I like to imagine that
308;00:28:49,968;00:28:53,303;the last time you spoke
309;00:28:53,355;00:28:55,305;was in this very room.
310;00:28:57,976;00:29:00,644;Are you still angry with him
311;00:29:00,695;00:29:02,563;after he...
312;00:29:07,202;00:29:08,402;what he did?
313;00:29:08,453;00:29:10,788;Don't worry.
314;00:29:10,822;00:29:12,990;The North remembers.
315;00:29:14,376;00:29:16,493;I punished him for it.
316;00:29:16,544;00:29:18,912;He's not ironborn anymore.
317;00:29:18,963;00:29:22,166;Not Theon Greyjoy anymore.
318;00:29:22,168;00:29:24,001;He's a new man.
319;00:29:25,503;00:29:28,472;A new person, anyway.
320;00:29:28,506;00:29:30,174;Aren't you, Reek?
321;00:29:30,176;00:29:31,842;Yes, master.
322;00:29:31,893;00:29:34,061;That's his
322;00:29:31,893;00:29:34,061;new name-- Reek.
323;00:29:34,095;00:29:36,180;Why are you doing this?
324;00:29:38,099;00:29:41,318;Because Reek has
324;00:29:38,099;00:29:41,318;something to say to you.
325;00:29:41,352;00:29:42,953;Don't you, Reek?
326;00:29:53,164;00:29:54,865;An apology.
327;00:30:00,672;00:30:03,841;Apologize to Lady Sansa
327;00:30:00,672;00:30:03,841;for what you did.
328;00:30:05,176;00:30:08,178;Apologize for murdering
328;00:30:05,176;00:30:08,178;her two brothers.
329;00:30:14,052;00:30:15,636;I'm sorry.
330;00:30:17,055;00:30:19,189;Look at her, Reek.
331;00:30:20,358;00:30:22,059;An apology doesn't mean anything
332;00:30:22,061;00:30:24,661;if you're not looking
332;00:30:22,061;00:30:24,661;the person in the eye.
333;00:30:30,869;00:30:33,737;I'm sorry.
333;00:30:30,869;00:30:33,737;- Sorry about what?
334;00:30:34,956;00:30:36,740;For killing your brothers.
335;00:30:47,302;00:30:50,170;There, over and done with.
336;00:30:50,221;00:30:53,724;Doesn't everyone
336;00:30:50,221;00:30:53,724;feel better? I do.
337;00:30:53,758;00:30:56,677;That was getting very tense.
338;00:30:57,562;00:30:59,263;Whew.
339;00:31:02,100;00:31:05,235;You know what, my lady?
340;00:31:05,270;00:31:08,105;What with him having
340;00:31:05,270;00:31:08,105;murdered your brothers
341;00:31:08,156;00:31:10,607;and the rest
341;00:31:08,156;00:31:10,607;of your family gone...
342;00:31:12,660;00:31:16,830;Reek here is the nearest
342;00:31:12,660;00:31:16,830;thing to living kin
343;00:31:16,865;00:31:18,866;that you have left.
344;00:31:20,201;00:31:22,169;Reek.
345;00:31:22,203;00:31:24,087;You will give away the bride.
346;00:31:26,791;00:31:30,427;Someone has to.
346;00:31:26,791;00:31:30,427;What better person?
347;00:31:30,461;00:31:31,929;Good? Good?
348;00:31:31,963;00:31:35,349;Yes, yes, very good.
349;00:31:35,383;00:31:37,384;Wonderful.
350;00:31:38,911;00:31:41,805;Walda and I have
350;00:31:38,911;00:31:41,805;some good news as well,
351;00:31:41,807;00:31:43,607;since we're all together.
352;00:31:48,980;00:31:51,141;We're going to have a baby.
353;00:31:56,704;00:31:58,539;I'm very happy for you.
354;00:31:58,573;00:32:00,541;From the way she's carrying,
355;00:32:00,575;00:32:03,460;Maester Wolkan says
355;00:32:00,575;00:32:03,460;it looks like a boy.
356;00:32:18,843;00:32:20,561;How can you be sure?
357;00:32:20,595;00:32:22,813;Sure of what?
358;00:32:22,847;00:32:24,748;That she's pregnant.
359;00:32:24,782;00:32:26,817;I mean...
360;00:32:26,851;00:32:28,518;how can you tell?
361;00:32:28,520;00:32:31,880;Maester Wolkan has assured
361;00:32:28,520;00:32:31,880;us beyond all doubt.
362;00:32:40,031;00:32:43,450;So how did you manage it?
363;00:32:43,501;00:32:45,335;Manage what?
364;00:32:45,370;00:32:47,704;Getting her pregnant.
365;00:32:47,755;00:32:49,806;I imagine you're familiar
365;00:32:47,755;00:32:49,806;with the procedure.
366;00:32:49,841;00:32:52,926;Of course, but how did you...
367;00:32:52,961;00:32:53,966;find it?
368;00:32:54,086;00:32:56,847;You disgraced yourself at dinner
369;00:32:56,881;00:32:59,216;parading that creature
369;00:32:56,881;00:32:59,216;before the Stark girl.
370;00:32:59,267;00:33:01,852;And if it's a boy?
371;00:33:04,055;00:33:05,722;You're worried about
371;00:33:04,055;00:33:05,722;your position.
372;00:33:05,773;00:33:07,858;My position is quite clear.
373;00:33:07,892;00:33:10,694;I'm your son
374;00:33:10,728;00:33:13,230;until a better
374;00:33:10,728;00:33:13,230;alternative comes along.
375;00:33:22,490;00:33:24,658;You've never asked me
375;00:33:22,490;00:33:24,658;about your mother.
376;00:33:29,163;00:33:31,581;Why would I?
377;00:33:31,583;00:33:34,418;She had me, she died.
378;00:33:35,586;00:33:38,273;And here we are.
379;00:33:38,393;00:33:40,630;She was a peasant girl.
380;00:33:41,039;00:33:43,466;Pretty in a common sort of way.
381;00:33:43,468;00:33:45,709;She was the miller's wife.
382;00:33:45,829;00:33:49,186;Apparently they had married
382;00:33:45,829;00:33:49,186;without my knowledge or consent.
383;00:33:49,460;00:33:51,168;So I had him hanged
384;00:33:51,288;00:33:54,727;and I took her beneath the
384;00:33:51,288;00:33:54,727;tree where he was swaying.
385;00:33:54,778;00:33:56,237;She fought me the whole time.
386;00:33:56,357;00:33:59,031;She was lucky
386;00:33:56,357;00:33:59,031;I didn't hang her, too.
387;00:33:59,066;00:34:01,228;A year later
387;00:33:59,066;00:34:01,228;she came to my gates
388;00:34:01,348;00:34:03,210;with a squalling baby
388;00:34:01,348;00:34:03,210;in her arms.
389;00:34:03,330;00:34:05,905;A baby she claimed was mine.
390;00:34:05,956;00:34:07,549;I nearly had her whipped
391;00:34:07,669;00:34:10,076;and the child
391;00:34:07,669;00:34:10,076;thrown in the river.
392;00:34:15,125;00:34:16,966;But then I looked at you
393;00:34:17,000;00:34:19,936;and I saw then what I see now.
394;00:34:19,970;00:34:22,171;You are my son.
395;00:34:34,019;00:34:37,005;Stannis Baratheon has
395;00:34:34,019;00:34:37,005;an army at Castle Black.
396;00:34:37,463;00:34:40,248;But he won't stay for long.
397;00:34:40,250;00:34:42,917;He wants the Iron Throne,
398;00:34:42,919;00:34:46,410;and the road to King's Landing
398;00:34:42,919;00:34:46,410;comes right through Winterfell.
399;00:34:47,416;00:34:50,447;He means to take the North.
400;00:34:52,116;00:34:54,334;But the North is ours.
401;00:34:54,369;00:34:56,503;It's yours and mine.
402;00:34:57,505;00:35:00,123;Will you help me defeat him?
403;00:35:01,626;00:35:03,460;Yes.
404;00:35:11,186;00:35:13,637;Is this every book there is?
405;00:35:14,806;00:35:16,557;Every book there is?
406;00:35:17,692;00:35:20,777;In the world.
406;00:35:17,692;00:35:20,777;Well, no.
407;00:35:20,812;00:35:24,815;There are thousands and
407;00:35:20,812;00:35:24,815;thousands of books out there.
408;00:35:24,817;00:35:27,067;This library is rather
408;00:35:24,817;00:35:27,067;small, actually.
409;00:35:27,118;00:35:28,785;Where you grew up,
409;00:35:27,118;00:35:28,785;were there more books?
410;00:35:28,820;00:35:31,655;My father's not
410;00:35:28,820;00:35:31,655;the most literate man.
411;00:35:34,025;00:35:37,661;They say the Citadel has the
411;00:35:34,025;00:35:37,661;largest library in the world.
412;00:35:37,663;00:35:39,129;Where's that?
413;00:35:40,298;00:35:42,816;The Citadel?
414;00:35:42,850;00:35:44,585;In Oldtown.
415;00:35:51,034;00:35:52,693;I'm sorry I don't know things.
416;00:35:52,813;00:35:55,898;Gilly, look at me.
417;00:35:55,933;00:35:59,852;You know how to do a hundred
417;00:35:55,933;00:35:59,852;things I can never do.
418;00:35:59,903;00:36:02,155;You can build a fire
418;00:35:59,903;00:36:02,155;with wet wood.
419;00:36:02,189;00:36:04,607;You can cook.
419;00:36:02,189;00:36:04,607;You can stitch a wound.
420;00:36:04,658;00:36:07,360;I can wash the linens.
420;00:36:04,658;00:36:07,360;I can sweep the floor.
421;00:36:07,411;00:36:10,747;Well... - Why does the Citadel have
421;00:36:07,411;00:36:10,747;the biggest library?
422;00:36:10,781;00:36:13,916;It's where they train
422;00:36:10,781;00:36:13,916;the maesters.
423;00:36:13,951;00:36:15,485;Like Maester Aemon?
424;00:36:15,519;00:36:18,287;I wanted to be one
424;00:36:15,519;00:36:18,287;when I was young.
425;00:36:20,841;00:36:25,094;Instead, I became a man
425;00:36:20,841;00:36:25,094;of the Night's Watch.
426;00:36:27,635;00:36:30,500;Far more adventure
426;00:36:27,635;00:36:30,500;up here anyway.
427;00:36:32,054;00:36:34,187;I wouldn't have met you.
428;00:36:39,296;00:36:41,978;Ah, Your Grace.
429;00:36:49,403;00:36:51,654;You're Samwell Tarly?
430;00:36:51,656;00:36:54,757;I am, Your Grace.
431;00:36:54,792;00:36:57,076;Your father is Randyll Tarly.
432;00:36:59,663;00:37:02,665;He defeated my brother
432;00:36:59,663;00:37:02,665;at the Battle of Ashford.
433;00:37:03,917;00:37:06,886;Only battle Robert ever lost.
434;00:37:06,920;00:37:10,506;I told him he shouldn't go so far
434;00:37:06,920;00:37:10,506;west so soon, but he never listened.
435;00:37:12,863;00:37:15,728;Fine soldier, your father.
436;00:37:15,762;00:37:17,847;You don't look like a soldier.
437;00:37:19,066;00:37:21,851;But I'm told you killed
437;00:37:19,066;00:37:21,851;a white walker.
438;00:37:21,853;00:37:23,686;I did, Your Grace.
439;00:37:23,737;00:37:24,987;How?
440;00:37:25,022;00:37:27,156;With a dagger
440;00:37:25,022;00:37:27,156;made of dragonglass.
441;00:37:27,191;00:37:28,184;Dragonglass?
442;00:37:28,408;00:37:30,026;What the maesters call obsidian.
443;00:37:30,077;00:37:32,361;I know what it is.
443;00:37:30,077;00:37:32,361;We have it in Dragonstone.
444;00:37:32,412;00:37:33,976;Why would obsidian
444;00:37:32,412;00:37:33,976;kill a walker?
445;00:37:34,096;00:37:36,115;I don't know.
446;00:37:36,166;00:37:38,007;I've been going through
446;00:37:36,166;00:37:38,007;all the old manuscripts
447;00:37:38,035;00:37:40,286;hoping to find something,
447;00:37:38,035;00:37:40,286;and all I've learned
448;00:37:40,337;00:37:43,241;is that the children of the forest
448;00:37:40,337;00:37:43,241;used to hunt with dragonglass.
449;00:37:43,361;00:37:47,510;The Lady Melisandre told me
449;00:37:43,361;00:37:47,510;that death marches on the Wall.
450;00:37:50,464;00:37:52,073;I've seen it, Your Grace.
451;00:37:52,193;00:37:54,050;Seen what?
452;00:37:54,052;00:37:56,953;The army of the dead.
453;00:37:56,987;00:38:00,656;And when they come--
453;00:37:56,987;00:38:00,656;We have to know how to fight them.
454;00:38:04,428;00:38:06,979;Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.
455;00:38:24,331;00:38:26,132;It's time.
456;00:38:26,166;00:38:28,417;Uh, Your Grace.
457;00:38:28,468;00:38:30,970;Wouldn't it be better to wait?
458;00:38:31,004;00:38:33,851;When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings,
458;00:38:31,004;00:38:33,851;we could have thousands more men.
459;00:38:33,922;00:38:35,442;If Jon Snow returns
459;00:38:33,922;00:38:35,442;with the wildlings.
460;00:38:35,455;00:38:37,139;We can't wait that long.
461;00:38:37,174;00:38:40,760;We have the advantage-- more men,
461;00:38:37,174;00:38:40,760;more horses, all fed and rested.
462;00:38:40,762;00:38:43,763;But every day we wait, the
462;00:38:40,762;00:38:43,763;odds shift in Bolton's favor.
463;00:38:43,814;00:38:45,898;This could turn to winter
463;00:38:43,814;00:38:45,898;at any moment.
464;00:38:45,933;00:38:47,733;We have to act now.
464;00:38:45,933;00:38:47,733;Give the order.
465;00:38:47,768;00:38:49,268;We march at sunrise.
466;00:38:49,270;00:38:51,020;I'll choose a dozen men to stay
467;00:38:51,071;00:38:53,489;and guard the queen
467;00:38:51,071;00:38:53,489;and the princess.
468;00:38:53,523;00:38:55,403;No need.
468;00:38:53,523;00:38:55,403;They're coming with us.
469;00:38:57,110;00:38:59,111;It's a tough road ahead,
469;00:38:57,110;00:38:59,111;Your Grace.
470;00:38:59,162;00:39:01,914;Won't they be safer--
470;00:38:59,162;00:39:01,914;Here?
471;00:39:01,949;00:39:05,618;Half these watchmen
471;00:39:01,949;00:39:05,618;are killers and rapists.
472;00:39:06,703;00:39:08,588;No, they march with us.
473;00:39:11,758;00:39:13,759;As you wish, Your Grace.
474;00:39:39,286;00:39:41,988;Do you think Father will
474;00:39:39,286;00:39:41,988;let me go down into the crypt?
475;00:39:41,990;00:39:43,630;Beg your pardon?
476;00:39:43,657;00:39:45,408;At Winterfell.
477;00:39:45,459;00:39:47,493;All the Kings in the North
477;00:39:45,459;00:39:47,493;are buried there.
478;00:39:47,495;00:39:49,328;Bran the Builder
478;00:39:47,495;00:39:49,328;and King Dorren and--
479;00:39:49,330;00:39:51,714;First things first.
479;00:39:49,330;00:39:51,714;It's a long march ahead.
480;00:39:51,748;00:39:53,716;And then we have
480;00:39:51,748;00:39:53,716;to take the castle.
481;00:39:53,750;00:39:55,167;Is there going to be a battle?
482;00:39:55,218;00:39:57,670;Aye, princess, but you
482;00:39:55,218;00:39:57,670;won't be anywhere near--
483;00:39:57,721;00:40:00,923;That's enough talk
483;00:39:57,721;00:40:00,923;of battle, Ser Davos.
484;00:40:00,974;00:40:02,391;You'll scare the child.
485;00:40:02,426;00:40:04,844;Yes, my queen.
486;00:40:07,230;00:40:10,182;I'm not scared.
486;00:40:07,230;00:40:10,182;Well, I am.
487;00:40:10,267;00:40:13,185;When the battle comes,
487;00:40:10,267;00:40:13,185;promise you'll protect me.
488;00:40:13,270;00:40:15,321;I promise.
489;00:40:35,125;00:40:38,544;I hope you know what you're
489;00:40:35,125;00:40:38,544;doing with these wildlings.
490;00:40:38,595;00:40:40,963;I need those ships.
491;00:40:42,015;00:40:45,184;You'll get them back,
491;00:40:42,015;00:40:45,184;I swear it.
492;00:40:46,720;00:40:49,055;Have a safe journey, Your Grace.
493;00:40:50,057;00:40:51,891;And thank you.
494;00:41:20,721;00:41:22,555;Mount up!
495;00:41:22,589;00:41:24,590;Colors!
496;00:42:14,141;00:42:16,142;No.
497;00:42:16,144;00:42:18,110;You're still too weak.
498;00:42:18,145;00:42:22,648;_
499;00:42:23,343;00:42:24,714;_
500;00:42:29,122;00:42:30,623;Ser Barristan?
501;00:42:36,541;00:42:37,737;_
502;00:42:41,787;00:42:43,594;_
503;00:42:44,640;00:42:46,310;_
504;00:42:46,430;00:42:48,037;_
505;00:42:48,847;00:42:50,492;_
506;00:42:52,112;00:42:53,993;_
507;00:42:56,416;00:42:58,651;Are you ashamed?
508;00:43:00,187;00:43:02,688;You were ambushed, outnumbered.
509;00:43:02,739;00:43:04,657;There was no way
509;00:43:02,739;00:43:04,657;you could have known.
510;00:43:04,691;00:43:06,742;This is not why.
511;00:43:09,196;00:43:11,413;Wounded in war,
512;00:43:11,448;00:43:14,783;there is no shame for this.
513;00:43:14,835;00:43:16,952;I am ashamed
514;00:43:17,003;00:43:19,538;because when the knife go in
515;00:43:19,589;00:43:22,925;and I fall to the ground,
516;00:43:22,959;00:43:24,877;I am afraid.
517;00:43:26,429;00:43:28,514;All men fear death.
518;00:43:28,548;00:43:31,333;No, not death.
519;00:43:33,887;00:43:36,555;I fear
520;00:43:36,606;00:43:41,520;I never again see Missandei
520;00:43:36,606;00:43:41,520;from the Island of Naath.
521;00:44:17,480;00:44:20,649;Now you have given the
521;00:44:17,480;00:44:20,649;Masters what they deserve.
522;00:44:20,684;00:44:22,234;If I give everyone
522;00:44:20,684;00:44:22,234;what they deserve,
523;00:44:22,269;00:44:24,436;I'll have no one left to rule.
524;00:44:24,438;00:44:26,989;Ser Barristan counseled mercy
525;00:44:27,023;00:44:29,704;when I took this city right
525;00:44:27,023;00:44:29,704;up to the morning he died.
526;00:44:29,743;00:44:32,528;Daario Naharis thinks I should
526;00:44:29,743;00:44:32,528;kill the former Masters
527;00:44:32,579;00:44:35,740;and let the rest of the
527;00:44:32,579;00:44:35,740;city fend for itself.
528;00:44:36,199;00:44:37,950;What do you think?
529;00:44:39,419;00:44:41,537;Your Grace, I think
529;00:44:39,419;00:44:41,537;that I am not fit
530;00:44:41,588;00:44:43,956;to have an opinion
530;00:44:41,588;00:44:43,956;on these matters.
531;00:44:44,007;00:44:46,458;You are as fit as anyone I know.
532;00:44:47,877;00:44:50,129;You know why I'm here.
533;00:44:50,131;00:44:53,215;And you know who will suffer the
533;00:44:50,131;00:44:53,215;most if this all falls apart.
534;00:44:53,266;00:44:56,435;So what do you think?
535;00:44:58,638;00:45:02,141;I can only tell you
535;00:44:58,638;00:45:02,141;what I have seen, Your Grace.
536;00:45:02,192;00:45:05,477;I have seen you listen
536;00:45:02,192;00:45:05,477;to your counselors.
537;00:45:07,197;00:45:10,816;I have seen you lean on their
537;00:45:07,197;00:45:10,816;experience when your own was lacking
538;00:45:10,867;00:45:13,919;and weigh the choices
538;00:45:10,867;00:45:13,919;they put before you.
539;00:45:15,622;00:45:18,624;And I have seen you
539;00:45:15,622;00:45:18,624;ignore your counselors...
540;00:45:21,494;00:45:23,996;because there was
540;00:45:21,494;00:45:23,996;a better choice.
541;00:45:24,030;00:45:26,382;One that only you could see.
542;00:45:43,099;00:45:46,352;My-- my queen,
542;00:45:43,099;00:45:46,352;please do not do this.
543;00:45:46,354;00:45:48,354;What about valar morghulis?
544;00:45:48,356;00:45:50,939;I did not want to die a coward.
545;00:45:55,695;00:45:58,330;Apparently I do not
545;00:45:55,695;00:45:58,330;want to die at all.
546;00:46:00,200;00:46:02,668;It takes courage to admit fear.
547;00:46:04,037;00:46:06,372;And to admit a mistake.
548;00:46:07,841;00:46:10,459;I came here to tell you
548;00:46:07,841;00:46:10,459;that I was wrong.
549;00:46:13,346;00:46:15,964;I was wrong and you were right.
550;00:46:17,934;00:46:20,052;About tradition.
551;00:46:21,471;00:46:24,306;About bringing the people
551;00:46:21,471;00:46:24,306;of this city together.
552;00:46:27,694;00:46:29,895;I will reopen the fighting pits.
553;00:46:30,864;00:46:32,448;To free men only.
554;00:46:32,482;00:46:36,702;Slavery will never return to
554;00:46:32,482;00:46:36,702;Meereen, not while I live.
555;00:46:36,736;00:46:38,821;Yes, my queen.
556;00:46:42,208;00:46:46,161;And in order to forge a lasting
556;00:46:42,208;00:46:46,161;bond with the Meereenese people,
557;00:46:46,212;00:46:48,997;I will marry the leader
557;00:46:46,212;00:46:48,997;of an ancient family.
558;00:46:51,251;00:46:54,253;Thankfully a suitor
558;00:46:51,251;00:46:54,253;is already on his knees.
559;00:47:22,415;00:47:24,199;Don't worry.
560;00:47:24,250;00:47:27,703;I'll be fine. Nothing
560;00:47:24,250;00:47:27,703;broken, I don't think.
561;00:47:29,873;00:47:31,673;Where are we now?
562;00:47:31,708;00:47:33,792;Not the Rhoyne.
563;00:47:39,849;00:47:42,518;Long, sullen silences
564;00:47:42,552;00:47:45,554;and an occasional
564;00:47:42,552;00:47:45,554;punch in the face.
565;00:47:47,357;00:47:49,475;The Mormont way.
566;00:47:52,946;00:47:55,697;Let's start over.
567;00:47:56,900;00:47:59,318;I apologize for before.
568;00:47:59,320;00:48:02,321;My mouth sometimes
568;00:47:59,320;00:48:02,321;runs away from me.
569;00:48:02,372;00:48:05,290;This doesn't have to be
569;00:48:02,372;00:48:05,290;an unpleasant trip.
570;00:48:10,079;00:48:13,240;We're going to be spending a lot of
570;00:48:10,079;00:48:13,240;time together on the way to Meereen.
571;00:48:13,249;00:48:14,633;We are.
572;00:48:16,469;00:48:19,805;What would make our time
572;00:48:16,469;00:48:19,805;together truly enjoyable
573;00:48:19,839;00:48:21,340;would be some wine.
574;00:48:22,175;00:48:23,675;No wine.
575;00:48:26,346;00:48:29,848;I am a person who drinks.
576;00:48:31,518;00:48:33,852;People who drink
576;00:48:31,518;00:48:33,852;need to keep drinking.
577;00:48:33,903;00:48:35,938;Otherwise, they're not...
578;00:48:43,363;00:48:44,863;I know where we are.
579;00:48:44,914;00:48:47,416;You're taking us
579;00:48:44,914;00:48:47,416;through Valyria.
580;00:48:47,450;00:48:48,834;I am.
581;00:48:48,868;00:48:51,036;Have you sailed
581;00:48:48,868;00:48:51,036;this route before?
582;00:48:51,087;00:48:52,621;No.
583;00:48:52,672;00:48:54,623;You're going to bring
583;00:48:52,672;00:48:54,623;Daenerys a souvenir
584;00:48:54,674;00:48:56,875;from her ancestral homeland
584;00:48:54,674;00:48:56,875;in case I'm not enough?
585;00:48:56,877;00:48:59,461;I think you'll be plenty.
586;00:49:00,597;00:49:02,681;You know what they say.
587;00:49:02,715;00:49:05,934;The Doom still rules Valyria.
588;00:49:05,969;00:49:08,887;What about the demons
588;00:49:05,969;00:49:08,887;and the flames?
589;00:49:10,056;00:49:11,773;Aren't you afraid of the Doom?
590;00:49:11,808;00:49:13,609;No.
591;00:49:13,643;00:49:16,061;But pirates are.
592;00:49:16,946;00:49:18,564;Oh.
593;00:49:21,484;00:49:25,037;The Smoking Sea.
594;00:49:25,071;00:49:27,039;How many centuries
594;00:49:25,071;00:49:27,039;before we learn
595;00:49:27,073;00:49:29,457;how to build cities
595;00:49:27,073;00:49:29,457;like this again?
596;00:49:30,692;00:49:33,494;Thousands of years the Valyrians were
597;00:49:33,528;00:49:36,337;the best in the world
597;00:49:33,528;00:49:36,337;at almost everything.
598;00:49:36,835;00:49:39,333;And then...
599;00:49:39,367;00:49:42,119;And then they weren't.
600;00:49:42,170;00:49:43,787;And then they weren't.
601;00:49:47,042;00:49:51,211;They held each other close and
601;00:49:47,042;00:49:51,211;turned their backs upon the end.
602;00:49:51,263;00:49:54,265;The hills that split asunder
603;00:49:54,299;00:49:57,101;and the black
603;00:49:54,299;00:49:57,101;"that ate the skies;"
604;00:49:57,135;00:49:58,832;The flames that shot
604;00:49:57,135;00:49:58,832;so high and hot
605;00:49:58,952;00:50:01,055;"that even dragons burned;"
606;00:50:01,106;00:50:02,882;Would never be the final sights
607;00:50:03,002;00:50:05,643;that fell upon their eyes.
608;00:50:06,084;00:50:07,795;A fly upon a wall,
609;00:50:08,381;00:50:12,351;the waves the sea wind
609;00:50:08,381;00:50:12,351;whipped and churned--
610;00:50:12,385;00:50:15,304;The city of a thousand years,
611;00:50:15,306;00:50:17,222;"and all that men had learned;"
612;00:50:17,273;00:50:20,726;The Doom consumed it all alike,
613;00:50:20,777;00:50:23,478;and neither
613;00:50:20,777;00:50:23,478;of them turned.
614;00:50:25,782;00:50:28,567;I would clap.
615;00:50:33,623;00:50:35,991;I suppose this is it, then.
616;00:50:37,160;00:50:39,294;This is what remains.
617;00:51:18,951;00:51:20,202;What was that?
618;00:51:26,759;00:51:29,127;Stone Men!
619;00:51:29,178;00:51:31,079;Don't let them touch you!
620;00:51:47,363;00:51:49,064;Get behind!
621;00:51:51,451;00:51:54,036;Mormont, cut me free!
622;00:51:54,070;00:51:56,238;Mormont!
623;00:52:11,003;00:52:12,921;Mormont!
624;00:52:12,923;00:52:15,057;Mormont!
625;00:52:50,609;00:52:52,660;Tyrion?
626;00:52:55,497;00:52:57,999;Tyrion.
627;00:52:58,033;00:52:59,701;Tyrion.
628;00:53:01,120;00:53:03,121;Tyrion.
629;00:53:04,046;00:53:06,424;You're all right.
630;00:53:15,968;00:53:18,303;You're heavier than you look.
631;00:53:20,806;00:53:23,141;Did any of them touch you?
632;00:53:25,895;00:53:27,812;You?
633;00:53:32,785;00:53:35,703;I've seen greyscale before,
634;00:53:35,738;00:53:37,205;but nothing like that.
635;00:53:37,239;00:53:40,158;I suppose that's why
635;00:53:37,239;00:53:40,158;they send them there.
636;00:53:42,161;00:53:45,681;It'd be kinder to put daggers in
636;00:53:42,161;00:53:45,681;their hearts and be done with it.
637;00:53:49,585;00:53:52,837;Thank you for saving me.
638;00:53:56,175;00:53:58,343;Of course, I wouldn't
638;00:53:56,175;00:53:58,343;have needed saving
639;00:53:58,345;00:54:00,626;if you hadn't kidnapped me
639;00:53:58,345;00:54:00,626;in the first place.
640;00:54:04,715;00:54:06,534;So what now?
641;00:54:06,641;00:54:08,725;We walk up the coast.
642;00:54:08,776;00:54:10,611;With luck, we'll find
642;00:54:08,776;00:54:10,611;a fishing village.
643;00:54:10,645;00:54:12,646;Maybe another boat.
644;00:54:12,648;00:54:14,932;Without luck?
645;00:54:14,966;00:54:17,651;We've got a long walk
645;00:54:14,966;00:54:17,651;ahead of us.
646;00:54:19,571;00:54:22,706;I'll get some wood for a fire.
647;00:54:22,740;00:54:25,492;Try to get some rest, huh?
648;00:54:25,543;00:54:28,278;That's the best idea
648;00:54:25,543;00:54:28,278;you've had all day.
