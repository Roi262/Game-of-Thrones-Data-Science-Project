1;00:00:00,535;00:00:02,586;The substance burns so hot,
2;00:00:02,836;00:00:05,672;it melts wood, stone, even steel.
3;00:00:05,922;00:00:08,049;And, of course, flesh.
4;00:00:08,299;00:00:10,218;If I could tell you
4;00:00:08,299;00:00:10,218;how many crazy old men
5;00:00:10,468;00:00:13,513;I've seen making grand claims
5;00:00:10,468;00:00:13,513;about jars full of pig shit.
6;00:00:13,763;00:00:15,794;Our order does not deal in pig shit.
7;00:00:16,185;00:00:18,393;King Stannis is my God.
7;00:00:16,185;00:00:18,393;He raised me up
8;00:00:18,643;00:00:20,812;and gave you a future
8;00:00:18,643;00:00:20,812;I could never have imagined.
9;00:00:21,062;00:00:23,440;And you think a Fire God
9;00:00:21,062;00:00:23,440;commanded all that?
10;00:00:23,690;00:00:26,202;It was Stannis.
10;00:00:23,690;00:00:26,202;He is my King, but he's only a man.
11;00:00:26,452;00:00:27,835;Don't tell him that.
12;00:00:28,340;00:00:30,155;Does it give you joy to scare people?
13;00:00:30,405;00:00:32,407;No, it gives me joy to kill people.
14;00:00:32,657;00:00:34,700;Killing's the sweetest
14;00:00:32,657;00:00:34,700;thing there is.
15;00:00:35,112;00:00:36,536;You shipped off my only daughter
16;00:00:36,786;00:00:39,080;and now you want to send my son
16;00:00:36,786;00:00:39,080;to the battlefield to die.
17;00:00:39,747;00:00:40,832;He needs to be out there.
18;00:00:41,373;00:00:43,877;The men will fight more
18;00:00:41,373;00:00:43,877;fiercely seeing their King
19;00:00:44,127;00:00:46,790;fighting beside them instead of hiding
19;00:00:44,127;00:00:46,790;behind his mother's skirts.
20;00:00:47,159;00:00:49,925;Stannis two days from the capital
20;00:00:47,159;00:00:49,925;and the wolf at my doorstep.
21;00:00:50,555;00:00:52,302;Scouts assure us Robb Stark
22;00:00:52,552;00:00:55,847;won't risk marching on Casterly Rock
22;00:00:52,552;00:00:55,847;until he's at full force.
23;00:00:56,097;00:00:57,641;He'll risk anything at any time.
24;00:00:57,891;00:00:59,460;We'll ride at nightfall.
25;00:00:59,820;00:01:02,854;The Stark forces are distracted.
25;00:00:59,820;00:01:02,854;Now is the time to strike.
26;00:01:03,104;00:01:06,584;My dear nephew, you do understand
26;00:01:03,104;00:01:06,584;Stannis Baratheon sails this way?
27;00:01:06,834;00:01:08,401;They say Stannis never smiles.
28;00:01:08,651;00:01:10,521;I'll give him a red smile.
29;00:01:11,102;00:01:14,366;If the wind holds,
29;00:01:11,102;00:01:14,366;we'll reach King's Landing in a day.
30;00:01:14,616;00:01:15,716;Will it hold?
31;00:01:15,966;00:01:18,151;Can't make promises for the wind,
31;00:01:15,966;00:01:18,151;Your Grace.
32;00:01:18,686;00:01:20,288;Stannis knows King's Landing.
33;00:01:20,538;00:01:22,457;He knows where
33;00:01:20,538;00:01:22,457;the walls are strongest
34;00:01:22,707;00:01:25,210;and he knows which gates are weakest.
35;00:01:25,460;00:01:28,296;Mud gate.
35;00:01:25,460;00:01:28,296;That's where he'll land.
36;00:01:28,546;00:01:30,966;And if Stannis
36;00:01:28,546;00:01:30,966;does attack the mud gate,
37;00:01:31,216;00:01:32,884;what do we have?
38;00:05:02,519;00:05:03,878;The tide's against us.
39;00:05:04,800;00:05:06,014;But we have the wind.
40;00:05:06,264;00:05:08,391;Should blow us straight to the gate.
41;00:05:09,407;00:05:12,978;You're coming home.
41;00:05:09,407;00:05:12,978;It hasn't been home for 20 years.
42;00:05:14,802;00:05:18,802;I spent most of my life
42;00:05:14,802;00:05:18,802;dodging the royal fleet.
43;00:05:20,670;00:05:23,072;And now I'm sailing right at them.
44;00:05:23,322;00:05:27,285;This is the royal fleet. You're not a
44;00:05:23,322;00:05:27,285;smuggler anymore, but the high captain.
45;00:05:27,535;00:05:30,350;Of course there are several royal fleets
45;00:05:27,535;00:05:30,350;at the moment.
46;00:05:30,600;00:05:31,664;Not after tonight.
47;00:05:32,536;00:05:36,567;When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on
47;00:05:32,536;00:05:36,567;the Iron Throne and you'll be his Hand.
48;00:05:36,817;00:05:38,328;Gods be good.
48;00:05:36,817;00:05:38,328;God.
49;00:05:39,290;00:05:41,090;Father, there is only one
49;00:05:39,290;00:05:41,090;and he watches over us.
50;00:05:41,340;00:05:43,308;But not over them?
50;00:05:41,340;00:05:43,308;Over all of us.
51;00:05:44,072;00:05:47,430;The people of King's Landing did not
51;00:05:44,072;00:05:47,430;choose the false king Joffrey Baratheon.
52;00:05:48,232;00:05:49,974;They will be glad to see
52;00:05:48,232;00:05:49,974;his head on a spike.
53;00:05:50,224;00:05:52,727;Well, first we have to put it there.
54;00:05:53,352;00:05:55,376;Our ships outnumber theirs 10 to 1.
55;00:05:55,626;00:05:57,357;Our army outnumber theirs 5 to 1.
56;00:05:57,952;00:05:59,609;Those walls have never been breached.
57;00:06:00,402;00:06:02,403;And the men guarding the walls,
57;00:06:00,402;00:06:02,403;when they see you,
58;00:06:02,653;00:06:04,377;they don't see a liberator.
59;00:06:05,064;00:06:08,159;They see a stranger
59;00:06:05,064;00:06:08,159;come to set their city on fire.
60;00:06:08,941;00:06:12,603;I have faith in the Lord of Light.
60;00:06:08,941;00:06:12,603;I have faith in our cause.
61;00:06:14,633;00:06:15,833;And in my captain.
62;00:06:50,926;00:06:52,638; Are you afraid, my lion?
63;00:06:57,421;00:07:01,808;If the city falls, Stannis will burn
63;00:06:57,421;00:07:01,808;every Lannister he can find.
64;00:07:03,776;00:07:05,412;Of course I'm afraid.
65;00:07:08,955;00:07:10,636;I won't let them hurt you.
66;00:07:15,614;00:07:16,967;I'm a Lannister.
67;00:07:17,605;00:07:19,623;I don't have a choice in all this.
68;00:07:21,488;00:07:22,986;But it's not your war.
69;00:07:29,887;00:07:31,117;It is now.
70;00:07:34,907;00:07:38,374;You can't fuck your way
70;00:07:34,907;00:07:38,374;out of everything.
71;00:07:40,135;00:07:41,544;I have so far.
72;00:07:45,114;00:07:47,842;Do you remember what you said
72;00:07:45,114;00:07:47,842;when you met me in your tent?
73;00:07:49,815;00:07:53,071;That I should make love to you like
73;00:07:49,815;00:07:53,071;it was your last day on this Earth.
74;00:08:06,728;00:08:10,114;As you know, Your Grace, it is not only
74;00:08:06,728;00:08:10,114;the sworn duty of a maester
75;00:08:10,364;00:08:14,394;to carry out the wishes
75;00:08:10,364;00:08:14,394;of the house he serves,
76;00:08:14,644;00:08:16,537;but also to offer guidance
77;00:08:16,787;00:08:20,487;and counsel in times of war.
78;00:08:20,737;00:08:23,089;Your words are always
78;00:08:20,737;00:08:23,089;wise and measured.
79;00:08:23,339;00:08:25,475;If you could...
79;00:08:23,339;00:08:25,475;If anything,
80;00:08:25,725;00:08:29,552;a maester's duties become more urgent
81;00:08:29,802;00:08:33,316;in times of war and turmoil.
82;00:08:34,447;00:08:37,436;I remember
82;00:08:34,447;00:08:37,436;back in the days of King...
83;00:08:37,686;00:08:39,310;You brought me something?
84;00:08:45,775;00:08:48,945;Essence of nightshade is as dangerous
85;00:08:49,633;00:08:51,360;as it is efficacious.
86;00:08:52,323;00:08:54,582;A single drop in a cup of wine
87;00:08:54,832;00:08:58,830;suffices to soothe ragged nerves.
88;00:08:59,080;00:09:03,412;Three drops will bring on a deep
88;00:08:59,080;00:09:03,412;and dreamless sleep.
89;00:09:05,000;00:09:08,040;10 drops, however...
89;00:09:05,000;00:09:08,040;I know what 10 drops will bring.
90;00:09:09,907;00:09:12,427;Your Grace, if I may ask...
90;00:09:09,907;00:09:12,427;You may not.
91;00:09:14,595;00:09:16,606;You must have a lot of work to do.
92;00:09:16,856;00:09:19,392;I'm sure many brave men
92;00:09:16,856;00:09:19,392;will need your wisdom soon.
93;00:09:21,056;00:09:23,396;Yes. A siege is very...
94;00:09:24,083;00:09:26,399;Be careful on the stairs, grand maester.
94;00:09:24,083;00:09:26,399;There are so many.
95;00:09:34,703;00:09:37,118;And so he spoke
96;00:09:37,368;00:09:41,713;that lord of castamere
97;00:09:41,963;00:09:44,500;but now the rains
98;00:09:44,750;00:09:46,687;weep o'er his halls
99;00:09:46,937;00:09:49,505;with no one there to hear
100;00:09:51,431;00:09:53,725;Yes, now the rains
101;00:09:53,975;00:09:56,261;weep o'er his halls
102;00:09:56,511;00:10:01,865;and not a soul to hear.
103;00:10:02,115;00:10:03,060;To the boys!
104;00:10:03,310;00:10:05,934;Lannisters!
105;00:10:06,184;00:10:08,065;Where'd you learn the Lannister song?
106;00:10:08,315;00:10:09,526;Drunk Lannisters.
107;00:10:12,028;00:10:14,813;You've got a pretty voice.
107;00:10:12,028;00:10:14,813;Thank you very much.
108;00:10:15,805;00:10:17,033;And I like your nose.
109;00:10:18,175;00:10:19,785;How many times you break it?
110;00:10:22,363;00:10:23,456;Well, now let's see.
111;00:10:24,549;00:10:27,335;First time I was five.
112;00:10:27,585;00:10:29,610;Me mom smacked me
112;00:10:27,585;00:10:29,610;with an iron poker.
113;00:10:30,689;00:10:32,692;It wasn't me she was aiming at.
114;00:10:33,208;00:10:36,552;She was trying for me little brother.
114;00:10:33,208;00:10:36,552;Now he was a real pest.
115;00:10:36,802;00:10:39,959;Second time I was nine.
116;00:10:41,027;00:10:43,198;Got in a scrap with a few older boys.
117;00:10:43,973;00:10:45,013;They won.
118;00:10:46,457;00:10:47,355;Third time...
119;00:10:55,988;00:10:58,214;You don't want to know
119;00:10:55,988;00:10:58,214;about the third time.
120;00:11:01,434;00:11:02,855;Poor nose.
121;00:11:03,874;00:11:05,474;Don't feel sorry for him.
122;00:11:05,724;00:11:08,543;He'll be halfway up your ass
122;00:11:05,724;00:11:08,543;before the night's through.
123;00:11:19,920;00:11:21,180;Welcome, friends.
124;00:11:25,608;00:11:26,852;This round's on me.
125;00:11:36,823;00:11:38,322;I don't think he likes me.
126;00:11:52,099;00:11:53,421;You think you're a hard man?
127;00:11:55,677;00:11:56,778;I know it.
128;00:12:02,461;00:12:03,791;It's warm in here.
129;00:12:04,765;00:12:08,060;We've got beautiful women
129;00:12:04,765;00:12:08,060;and good brown ale.
130;00:12:08,757;00:12:10,301;Plenty for everyone.
131;00:12:11,374;00:12:12,773;And all you want
132;00:12:13,023;00:12:15,735;is to put one of us
132;00:12:13,023;00:12:15,735;in the cold ground
133;00:12:15,985;00:12:17,737;with no women to keep us company.
134;00:12:18,480;00:12:20,640;There's women in the ground.
135;00:12:20,890;00:12:24,035;I put some there myself.
135;00:12:20,890;00:12:24,035;So have you.
136;00:12:26,897;00:12:29,040;You like fucking and drinking
137;00:12:29,290;00:12:30,584;and singing.
138;00:12:33,135;00:12:34,365;But killing...
139;00:12:36,297;00:12:37,683;Killing's the thing you love.
140;00:12:39,247;00:12:40,745;You're just like me.
141;00:12:44,444;00:12:45,743;Only smaller.
142;00:12:48,524;00:12:49,747;And quicker.
143;00:12:54,596;00:12:56,491;Your Lord Imp is gonna miss you.
144;00:13:07,599;00:13:09,479;I expect he will someday.
145;00:13:28,901;00:13:30,351;One more drink before the war?
146;00:13:31,012;00:13:32,097;Shall we?
147;00:13:43,708;00:13:47,594;I've always hated the bells.
147;00:13:43,708;00:13:47,594;They ring for horror...
148;00:13:47,844;00:13:50,425;A dead king, a city under siege.
149;00:13:50,675;00:13:52,303;A wedding.
149;00:13:50,675;00:13:52,303;Exactly.
150;00:13:54,862;00:13:55,960;Podrick, is that it?
151;00:13:56,900;00:13:59,046;Is that it?
151;00:13:56,900;00:13:59,046;Nice touch.
152;00:13:59,901;00:14:02,508;As if you don't know
152;00:13:59,901;00:14:02,508;the name of every boy in town.
153;00:14:02,758;00:14:05,344;I'm not entirely sure
153;00:14:02,758;00:14:05,344;what you're suggesting.
154;00:14:05,594;00:14:08,681;I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure
154;00:14:05,594;00:14:08,681;what I'm suggesting.
155;00:14:09,595;00:14:11,100;Do you trust him?
156;00:14:14,908;00:14:16,313;Oddly enough, I do.
157;00:14:18,020;00:14:18,846;Good.
158;00:14:25,103;00:14:26,741;The map you asked for.
159;00:14:31,384;00:14:33,833;There must be 20 miles of tunnels
159;00:14:31,384;00:14:33,833;beneath the city.
160;00:14:34,083;00:14:35,624;Closer to 50.
161;00:14:35,874;00:14:39,253;The Targaryens built this city
161;00:14:35,874;00:14:39,253;to withstand a siege
162;00:14:39,503;00:14:42,965;and to provide escape if necessary.
163;00:14:43,215;00:14:44,465;I'm not escaping.
164;00:14:45,209;00:14:48,637;I'm the captain of the ship.
164;00:14:45,209;00:14:48,637;If the ship goes down, I go with her.
165;00:14:48,887;00:14:50,589;That is good to hear.
166;00:14:50,839;00:14:55,186;Though I'm sure many captains
166;00:14:50,839;00:14:55,186;say the same while their ship is afloat.
167;00:14:56,454;00:15:00,399;You look well suited for battle.
167;00:14:56,454;00:15:00,399;Well, I'm not.
168;00:15:01,029;00:15:03,319;For all our sakes,
168;00:15:01,029;00:15:03,319;I hope you are wrong.
169;00:15:04,961;00:15:07,407;My little birds tell me
169;00:15:04,961;00:15:07,407;that Stannis Baratheon
170;00:15:07,657;00:15:10,951;has taken up
170;00:15:07,657;00:15:10,951;with a red priestess from Asshai.
171;00:15:11,201;00:15:12,460;What of it?
172;00:15:12,710;00:15:16,040;You don't believe
172;00:15:12,710;00:15:16,040;in the old powers, my Lord?
173;00:15:16,290;00:15:19,210;Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting.
173;00:15:16,290;00:15:19,210;What do you think?
174;00:15:20,220;00:15:22,838;I think you believe in what you see
175;00:15:24,077;00:15:26,342;and in what those
175;00:15:24,077;00:15:26,342;you trust have seen.
176;00:15:28,114;00:15:30,721;You probably don't entirely trust me.
177;00:15:31,389;00:15:34,475;Don't take it personally.
177;00:15:31,389;00:15:34,475;I don't entirely trust myself.
178;00:15:35,425;00:15:37,394;And yet I have seen things
179;00:15:38,219;00:15:41,190;and heard things...
179;00:15:38,219;00:15:41,190;things you have not,
180;00:15:41,754;00:15:43,940;things I wish I had not.
181;00:15:47,496;00:15:50,324;I don't believe
181;00:15:47,496;00:15:50,324;I've ever told you how I was cut.
182;00:15:52,511;00:15:53,953;No, I don't believe you have.
183;00:15:56,120;00:15:57,790;One day I will.
184;00:15:59,965;00:16:03,597;The dark arts have provided
184;00:15:59,965;00:16:03,597;Lord Stannis with his armies
185;00:16:03,847;00:16:05,464;and paved his path to our door.
186;00:16:07,158;00:16:11,218;For a man in a service to such powers
186;00:16:07,158;00:16:11,218;to sit on the Iron Throne,
187;00:16:11,468;00:16:13,483;I can think of nothing worse.
188;00:16:14,724;00:16:17,268;And tonight, I believe
189;00:16:17,518;00:16:20,099;you are the only man
189;00:16:17,518;00:16:20,099;who can stop him.
190;00:16:47,156;00:16:49,138;They're welcoming the new King.
191;00:16:49,388;00:16:51,594;I've never known bells
191;00:16:49,388;00:16:51,594;to mean surrender.
192;00:16:53,181;00:16:55,947;They want to play music with us?
192;00:16:53,181;00:16:55,947;Let's play. Drums.
193;00:16:57,171;00:16:57,975;Drums!
194;00:17:23,716;00:17:26,174;Remember, wait till...
194;00:17:23,716;00:17:26,174;The ships are in the bay.
195;00:17:26,424;00:17:29,415;They must be far enough in...
195;00:17:26,424;00:17:29,415;I know what in means.
196;00:17:29,665;00:17:31,926;Do you know how to use that?
196;00:17:29,665;00:17:31,926;I chopped wood once.
197;00:17:32,520;00:17:34,567;No, I watched my brother
197;00:17:32,520;00:17:34,567;chopping wood.
198;00:17:35,262;00:17:38,015;I saw you kill a man with a shield.
198;00:17:35,262;00:17:38,015;You'll be unstoppable with an axe.
199;00:17:40,076;00:17:42,216;Don't get killed.
199;00:17:40,076;00:17:42,216;Nor you, my friend.
200;00:17:43,133;00:17:45,297;Are we friends now?
200;00:17:43,133;00:17:45,297;Of course we are.
201;00:17:45,547;00:17:47,650;Just because I pay you
201;00:17:45,547;00:17:47,650;doesn't diminish our friendship.
202;00:17:48,934;00:17:50,027;Enhances it, really.
203;00:17:50,563;00:17:52,821;Oh, enhances.
203;00:17:50,563;00:17:52,821;Fancy word for a sellsword.
204;00:17:53,071;00:17:55,217;Been spending time with fancy folks.
205;00:18:06,767;00:18:09,922;Lady Sansa and Sheila.
206;00:18:10,782;00:18:11,590;Shae.
207;00:18:11,840;00:18:13,092;Shae, yes.
208;00:18:13,565;00:18:17,160;Surely my sister has asked you to join
208;00:18:13,565;00:18:17,160;the other ladies in Maegor's holdfast.
209;00:18:17,410;00:18:20,683;She has, my Lord, but King Joffrey
209;00:18:17,410;00:18:20,683;sent for me to see him off.
210;00:18:23,226;00:18:25,020;He's been a great romantic,
210;00:18:23,226;00:18:25,020;my nephew.
211;00:18:25,270;00:18:26,772;Sansa, come here.
212;00:18:29,554;00:18:31,652;I will pray for your safe return,
212;00:18:29,554;00:18:31,652;my Lord.
213;00:18:32,351;00:18:33,153;Will you?
214;00:18:33,403;00:18:35,285;Just as I pray for the King's.
215;00:18:40,285;00:18:41,495;Stay safe, my Lady.
216;00:18:41,745;00:18:43,089;And you, my lion.
217;00:18:49,169;00:18:51,281;Your King rides forth to battle.
218;00:18:52,244;00:18:54,293;You should see him off with a kiss.
219;00:18:55,628;00:18:56,885;My new blade.
220;00:18:57,135;00:18:58,637;Hearteater I've named it.
221;00:19:01,295;00:19:02,319;Kiss it.
222;00:19:12,705;00:19:16,363;You'll kiss it again when I return
222;00:19:12,705;00:19:16,363;and taste my Uncle's blood.
223;00:19:16,613;00:19:18,073;Will you slay him yourself?
224;00:19:18,705;00:19:21,702;If Stannis is fool enough
224;00:19:18,705;00:19:21,702;to come near me.
225;00:19:21,952;00:19:24,663;So you'll be outside the gates
225;00:19:21,952;00:19:24,663;fighting in the vanguard?
226;00:19:25,676;00:19:29,126;A King doesn't discuss battle plans
226;00:19:25,676;00:19:29,126;with stupid girls.
227;00:19:30,226;00:19:32,883;I'm sorry, Your Grace.
227;00:19:30,226;00:19:32,883;You're right, I'm stupid.
228;00:19:33,133;00:19:35,091;Of course you'll be in the vanguard.
229;00:19:36,675;00:19:38,761;My brother Robb always goes
229;00:19:36,675;00:19:38,761;where the fighting is thickest.
230;00:19:39,011;00:19:42,347;And he is only a pretender.
230;00:19:39,011;00:19:42,347;Your brother's turn will come.
231;00:19:43,381;00:19:46,057;Then you can lick his blood
231;00:19:43,381;00:19:46,057;off hearteater, too.
232;00:19:58,656;00:20:01,224;Some of those boys
232;00:19:58,656;00:20:01,224;will never come back.
233;00:20:01,759;00:20:02,860;Joffrey will.
234;00:20:03,755;00:20:05,528;The worst ones always live.
235;00:20:07,414;00:20:08,448;Come, my Lady.
236;00:20:55,323;00:20:56,622;Where's our fleet?
237;00:20:57,478;00:20:58,465;On the way.
238;00:20:59,386;00:21:01,510;Why isn't it here now?
238;00:20:59,386;00:21:01,510;They're coming.
239;00:21:03,428;00:21:06,966;Hound, tell the Hand that his King
239;00:21:03,428;00:21:06,966;has asked him a question.
240;00:21:07,216;00:21:09,059;The King has asked you a question.
241;00:21:09,890;00:21:12,729;Ser lancel, tell the Hound to tell the
241;00:21:09,890;00:21:12,729;King that the Hand is extremely busy.
242;00:21:13,772;00:21:16,410;The Hand of the King would like me
242;00:21:13,772;00:21:16,410;to tell you to tell the King...
243;00:21:16,660;00:21:19,862;If I tell the hound to cut you in half,
243;00:21:16,660;00:21:19,862;he'll do it without a second thought.
244;00:21:20,112;00:21:23,949;That would make me the quarterman.
244;00:21:20,112;00:21:23,949;It doesn't have the same ring to it.
245;00:21:25,305;00:21:27,997;Cut me in half
245;00:21:25,305;00:21:27,997;and I won't be able to give the signal.
246;00:21:28,247;00:21:30,581;No signal, no plan.
246;00:21:28,247;00:21:30,581;No plan and Stannis Baratheon
247;00:21:30,831;00:21:33,041;sacks this city,
247;00:21:30,831;00:21:33,041;takes the Iron Throne,
248;00:21:33,291;00:21:36,003;puts your pinched little
248;00:21:33,291;00:21:36,003;head atop a gate somewhere.
249;00:21:36,702;00:21:40,340;It might be quite amusing, except
249;00:21:36,702;00:21:40,340;that my head would be up there, too.
250;00:21:40,590;00:21:44,763;I've never much liked my head,
250;00:21:40,590;00:21:44,763;but I don't want to see it removed yet.
251;00:21:48,550;00:21:49,834;Where are their ships?
252;00:21:50,084;00:21:52,548;It is wise to attack at night.
252;00:21:50,084;00:21:52,548;We took them by surprise.
253;00:21:52,798;00:21:55,715;Lord Varys knows what you had
253;00:21:52,798;00:21:55,715;for breakfast three days ago.
254;00:21:55,965;00:21:57,382;There are no surprises here.
255;00:21:57,632;00:22:01,570;There is dissention in their ranks,
255;00:21:57,632;00:22:01,570;maybe their sailors have mutinied.
256;00:22:02,211;00:22:03,220;Maybe.
257;00:22:19,753;00:22:21,673;I don't know why she wants me here.
258;00:22:21,923;00:22:24,635;She's always saying how stupid I am.
258;00:22:21,923;00:22:24,635;She hates me.
259;00:22:24,885;00:22:27,782;Maybe she hates you
259;00:22:24,885;00:22:27,782;less than she hates everyone else.
260;00:22:29,081;00:22:30,151;I doubt it.
261;00:22:30,969;00:22:32,712;Maybe she's jealous of you.
262;00:22:34,065;00:22:35,670;Why would she be jealous?
263;00:22:41,120;00:22:43,695;I was wondering
263;00:22:41,120;00:22:43,695;where our little dove had flown.
264;00:22:44,901;00:22:46,399;You look pale, child.
265;00:22:47,407;00:22:49,368;Is your red flower still blooming?
266;00:22:51,957;00:22:53,247;Fitting, isn't it?
267;00:22:53,918;00:22:57,167;The men will bleed out there
267;00:22:53,918;00:22:57,167;and you will bleed in here.
268;00:22:57,902;00:22:59,538;Pour Lady Sansa some wine.
269;00:23:00,420;00:23:01,797;I'm not thirsty.
269;00:23:00,420;00:23:01,797;So?
270;00:23:02,434;00:23:04,549;I didn't offer you water.
271;00:23:09,180;00:23:10,514;What's he doing here?
272;00:23:11,082;00:23:12,091;Ser Ilyn?
273;00:23:13,225;00:23:14,742;He's here to defend us.
274;00:23:15,852;00:23:18,814;When the axes smash down those doors,
274;00:23:15,852;00:23:18,814;you may be glad to have him.
275;00:23:19,064;00:23:21,608;But we have guards to defend us.
275;00:23:19,064;00:23:21,608;Guards we have paid.
276;00:23:22,846;00:23:26,321;Should the city fall, they'll be
276;00:23:22,846;00:23:26,321;the first ones out of the doors.
277;00:23:30,515;00:23:32,828;The lads caught a groom and two maids
277;00:23:30,515;00:23:32,828;trying to sneak away
278;00:23:33,078;00:23:35,205;with a stolen horse
278;00:23:33,078;00:23:35,205;and some gold cups.
279;00:23:35,455;00:23:37,223;The battle's first traitors.
280;00:23:37,803;00:23:39,266;Have ser ilyn see to them.
281;00:23:39,516;00:23:42,087;Put their heads on spikes
281;00:23:39,516;00:23:42,087;outside the stables as a warning.
282;00:23:45,382;00:23:48,719;The only way to keep the small folk
282;00:23:45,382;00:23:48,719;loyal is to make certain they fear you
283;00:23:49,291;00:23:51,013;more than they do the enemy.
283;00:23:49,291;00:23:51,013;Remember that,
284;00:23:53,181;00:23:54,975;if you ever hope to become a queen.
285;00:23:56,485;00:23:58,562;You said he was here to protect us.
286;00:24:01,023;00:24:01,840;He is.
287;00:24:03,229;00:24:05,444;Traitors are a danger to us all.
288;00:24:05,694;00:24:06,830;More wine.
289;00:24:22,544;00:24:23,603;There they are.
290;00:24:27,090;00:24:30,802;Archers to their marks.
290;00:24:27,090;00:24:30,802;Archers, to your marks!
291;00:24:40,812;00:24:41,897;Nock your arrows!
292;00:24:45,692;00:24:46,765;Hold fast.
293;00:24:48,400;00:24:50,768;What are you doing?
293;00:24:48,400;00:24:50,768;We need to attack them.
294;00:24:51,406;00:24:52,434;Hold fast.
295;00:24:59,242;00:25:01,666;There's only one ship.
295;00:24:59,242;00:25:01,666;Where are the rest of them?
296;00:25:02,958;00:25:04,669;Where are the rest of them?!
297;00:25:09,424;00:25:10,509;Only one ship.
298;00:25:14,512;00:25:15,847;Archers, stand to!
299;00:25:16,948;00:25:18,016;Man the below!
300;00:25:18,266;00:25:20,310;Nock!
300;00:25:18,266;00:25:20,310;Nock and set!
301;00:25:21,770;00:25:22,927;Draw!
302;00:25:29,263;00:25:30,153;Hold.
303;00:25:40,360;00:25:41,415;No one on board.
304;00:26:15,156;00:26:16,158;Wildfire.
305;00:26:16,408;00:26:19,119;Steer clear!
305;00:26:16,408;00:26:19,119;Steer clear!
306;00:26:44,310;00:26:45,604;Matthos, get down!
307;00:28:20,590;00:28:21,858;Prepare to land.
308;00:28:22,785;00:28:24,869;The dwarf
308;00:28:22,785;00:28:24,869;has played his little trick.
309;00:28:25,119;00:28:27,587;The wildfire...
309;00:28:25,119;00:28:27,587;He can only play it once.
310;00:28:27,837;00:28:29,839;We're too far from the gates.
311;00:28:30,089;00:28:32,419;The fire, their archers...
312;00:28:32,669;00:28:34,028;Hundreds will die.
313;00:28:35,764;00:28:36,910;Thousands.
314;00:28:50,998;00:28:53,077;Come with me and take this city!
315;00:29:11,641;00:29:13,126;Sansa, come here, little dove.
316;00:29:20,100;00:29:21,109;My Queen.
317;00:29:22,332;00:29:23,762;What are you doing?
318;00:29:24,012;00:29:25,096;Praying.
319;00:29:25,346;00:29:28,642;You're perfect, aren't you?
319;00:29:25,346;00:29:28,642;Praying.
320;00:29:30,347;00:29:31,908;What are you praying for?
321;00:29:32,158;00:29:34,356;For the Gods to have mercy on us all.
322;00:29:36,539;00:29:37,720;On all of us?
323;00:29:38,935;00:29:40,236;Even me?
324;00:29:40,486;00:29:42,072;Of course, Your Grace.
325;00:29:42,322;00:29:43,615;Even Joffrey?
326;00:29:46,172;00:29:48,741;Joffrey is my...
326;00:29:46,172;00:29:48,741;Shut up, you little fool.
327;00:29:49,447;00:29:51,990;Praying to the Gods
327;00:29:49,447;00:29:51,990;to have mercy on us all.
328;00:29:52,723;00:29:54,668;The Gods have no mercy.
328;00:29:52,723;00:29:54,668;That's why they're gods.
329;00:29:56,345;00:29:59,005;My father told me that
329;00:29:56,345;00:29:59,005;when he caught me praying.
330;00:30:00,664;00:30:02,568;My mother just died, you see.
331;00:30:02,818;00:30:06,641;I didn't really understand the concept
331;00:30:02,818;00:30:06,641;of death, the finality of it.
332;00:30:07,991;00:30:10,177;I thought that if I prayed
332;00:30:07,991;00:30:10,177;very, very hard,
333;00:30:10,427;00:30:13,395;the Gods would return mymother to me.
333;00:30:10,427;00:30:13,395;I was four.
334;00:30:14,183;00:30:16,445;Your father doesn't
334;00:30:14,183;00:30:16,445;believe in the Gods?
335;00:30:16,898;00:30:18,733;He doesn't like them very much.
336;00:30:22,044;00:30:23,160;One for her.
337;00:30:27,743;00:30:28,576;Here.
338;00:30:30,995;00:30:32,163;Sit.
339;00:30:32,807;00:30:33,831;Drink.
340;00:30:37,141;00:30:38,420;Not like that. Drink, girl.
341;00:30:42,958;00:30:44,843;I should have been born a man.
342;00:30:45,093;00:30:48,596;I'd rather face 1,000 swords
342;00:30:45,093;00:30:48,596;than be shut up inside
343;00:30:48,846;00:30:50,859;with this flock of frightened hens.
344;00:30:51,109;00:30:54,477;They are your guests under
344;00:30:51,109;00:30:54,477;your protection. You asked them here.
345;00:30:54,727;00:30:56,588;It was expected of me,
346;00:30:56,838;00:31:00,900;as it will be of you if you
346;00:30:56,838;00:31:00,900;ever become Joffrey's Queen.
347;00:31:01,150;00:31:04,329;If my wretched brother
347;00:31:01,150;00:31:04,329;should somehow prevail,
348;00:31:05,279;00:31:08,241;these hens will return to their cocks
349;00:31:08,491;00:31:12,996;and crow of how my courage
349;00:31:08,491;00:31:12,996;inspired them, lifted their spirits.
350;00:31:13,867;00:31:15,707;And if the city should fall?
351;00:31:18,130;00:31:19,586;You'd like that, wouldn't you?
352;00:31:20,963;00:31:22,797;The red keep should hold for a time,
353;00:31:23,047;00:31:26,468;long enough for me to go to the walls
353;00:31:23,047;00:31:26,468;and yield to Lord Stannis in person.
354;00:31:27,834;00:31:30,180;If it were anyone else
354;00:31:27,834;00:31:30,180;outside those gates,
355;00:31:30,430;00:31:34,505;I might have hoped for a private audience.
355;00:31:30,430;00:31:34,505;But this is Stannis Baratheon.
356;00:31:35,304;00:31:38,688;I'd have a better chance
356;00:31:35,304;00:31:38,688;of seducing his horse.
357;00:31:42,083;00:31:43,787;Have I shocked you, little dove?
358;00:31:44,414;00:31:47,030;Tears aren't a woman's only weapon.
359;00:31:49,334;00:31:51,321;The best one's between your legs.
360;00:31:51,902;00:31:54,537;Learn how to use it.
360;00:31:51,902;00:31:54,537;Drink.
361;00:31:58,249;00:32:02,045;Do you have any notion of what happens
361;00:31:58,249;00:32:02,045;when a city is sacked?
362;00:32:03,409;00:32:05,548;No, you wouldn't, would you?
363;00:32:07,104;00:32:09,581;If the city falls, these fine women
364;00:32:11,149;00:32:12,847;should be in for a bit of a rape.
365;00:32:14,148;00:32:15,767;Half of them will have bastards
366;00:32:16,017;00:32:17,819;in their bellies come the morning.
367;00:32:18,603;00:32:21,064;You'll be glad
367;00:32:18,603;00:32:21,064;of your red flower then.
368;00:32:22,647;00:32:24,526;When a man's blood is up,
369;00:32:24,776;00:32:26,436;anything with tits looks good.
370;00:32:27,384;00:32:29,447;A precious thing like you will look
371;00:32:30,573;00:32:31,837;very, very good.
372;00:32:32,617;00:32:36,746;A slice of cake
372;00:32:32,617;00:32:36,746;just waiting to be eaten.
373;00:33:02,619;00:33:05,233;He's a serious man...
373;00:33:02,619;00:33:05,233;Stannis Baratheon.
374;00:33:06,283;00:33:07,527;They're coming ashore.
375;00:33:09,216;00:33:10,446;Rain fire on them.
376;00:33:11,281;00:33:12,157;Archers!
377;00:33:12,407;00:33:13,616;There are too many.
378;00:33:14,177;00:33:17,829;Form a welcome party for any Baratheon
378;00:33:14,177;00:33:17,829;troop that manages to touch solid ground.
379;00:33:20,623;00:33:21,415;Pod,
380;00:33:22,428;00:33:25,503;run to the king's gate,
380;00:33:22,428;00:33:25,503;bring any men guarding it here now.
381;00:33:29,349;00:33:31,467;Stannis is sending us fresh meat.
382;00:33:31,717;00:33:32,726;You, too.
383;00:33:35,147;00:33:37,515;Any of these flaming
383;00:33:35,147;00:33:37,515;fucking arrows come near me,
384;00:33:37,765;00:33:39,690;i'll strangle you with your own guts.
385;00:35:09,649;00:35:11,276;The mud gate, go now!
386;00:35:11,526;00:35:14,570;First and second squads, to the gate!
386;00:35:11,526;00:35:14,570;To the mud gate!
387;00:35:14,820;00:35:16,572;Any man dies with a clean sword,
388;00:35:16,822;00:35:18,830;I'll rape his fucking corpse.
389;00:35:54,694;00:35:57,555;When we were young, Jaime and I,
389;00:35:54,694;00:35:57,555;we looked so much alike.
390;00:35:57,805;00:36:00,171;Even our father
390;00:35:57,805;00:36:00,171;couldn't tell us apart.
391;00:36:00,421;00:36:03,647;I could never understand
391;00:36:00,421;00:36:03,647;why they treated us differently.
392;00:36:04,845;00:36:08,836;Jaime was taught to fight
392;00:36:04,845;00:36:08,836;with sword and lance and mace,
393;00:36:09,086;00:36:11,336;and I was taught to smile
394;00:36:11,586;00:36:13,296;and sing and please.
395;00:36:13,864;00:36:15,759;He was heir to casterly rock
396;00:36:16,701;00:36:21,179;and I was sold to some stranger like a
396;00:36:16,701;00:36:21,179;horse to be ridden whenever he desired.
397;00:36:21,429;00:36:23,186;You were Robert's Queen.
398;00:36:24,140;00:36:25,767;And you will be joffrey's.
398;00:36:24,140;00:36:25,767;Enjoy.
399;00:36:30,109;00:36:31,397;I don't think I know this one.
400;00:36:37,895;00:36:38,904;Pretty.
401;00:36:45,911;00:36:47,622;That's the worst curtsy
401;00:36:45,911;00:36:47,622;I've ever seen.
402;00:36:48,169;00:36:50,500;Here, it's not difficult.
402;00:36:48,169;00:36:50,500;I mastered it when I was four.
403;00:36:51,293;00:36:53,112;Straighten your back and bend.
404;00:36:56,656;00:36:58,341;Better.
404;00:36:56,656;00:36:58,341;You learn fast.
405;00:36:59,122;00:37:02,026;How long have you been
405;00:36:59,122;00:37:02,026;in Lady Sansa's service?
406;00:37:03,128;00:37:04,290;A few weeks.
407;00:37:08,453;00:37:10,353;When did you leave Lorath?
408;00:37:12,146;00:37:14,315;I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.
409;00:37:17,485;00:37:19,502;But she was a nobleman's daughter.
410;00:37:20,343;00:37:21,406;You're not.
411;00:37:25,526;00:37:27,203;When did you come to Westeros?
412;00:37:28,662;00:37:30,498;10 years ago, Your Grace.
413;00:37:31,295;00:37:34,152;From Lorathi commoner
413;00:37:31,295;00:37:34,152;to the Red Keep
414;00:37:34,402;00:37:36,712;in 10 years, all without
414;00:37:34,402;00:37:36,712;learning how to curtsy.
415;00:37:39,006;00:37:41,259;I imagine that's
415;00:37:39,006;00:37:41,259;a very interesting story.
416;00:37:42,804;00:37:43,761;What's your name?
417;00:37:44,503;00:37:46,264;Shae, Your Grace.
418;00:37:46,514;00:37:48,349;Tell us a story, Shae.
419;00:37:54,563;00:37:56,732;When I was 13, I...
420;00:38:00,608;00:38:01,663;What news?
421;00:38:03,313;00:38:05,015;The Imp has set the river afire.
422;00:38:05,265;00:38:07,721;Hundreds of ships are burning,
422;00:38:05,265;00:38:07,721;maybe more.
423;00:38:07,971;00:38:10,496;Stannis's fleet destroyed, but...
424;00:38:13,894;00:38:16,619;But his troops
424;00:38:13,894;00:38:16,619;have landed outside the city walls.
425;00:38:17,173;00:38:18,488;Where is Joffrey?
426;00:38:19,485;00:38:21,482;On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.
427;00:38:21,732;00:38:23,588;Bring him back inside at once.
428;00:38:24,185;00:38:25,943;But, Your Grace...
428;00:38:24,185;00:38:25,943;What?
429;00:38:26,777;00:38:28,973;The King's presence
429;00:38:26,777;00:38:28,973;is good for morale.
430;00:38:29,223;00:38:32,518;Bring him back to his chambers now.
430;00:38:29,223;00:38:32,518;Not here?
431;00:38:32,768;00:38:36,147;With the women and children?
431;00:38:32,768;00:38:36,147;Do you want him to be mocked?
432;00:38:36,397;00:38:38,336;No, but I...
432;00:38:36,397;00:38:38,336;Now!
433;00:38:43,937;00:38:45,865;When I told you
433;00:38:43,937;00:38:45,865;about ser Ilyn earlier, I lied.
434;00:38:49,133;00:38:50,661;Do you want to hear the truth?
435;00:38:50,911;00:38:52,878;You want to know why
435;00:38:50,911;00:38:52,878;he's really here?
436;00:38:55,037;00:38:56,501;He's here for us.
437;00:38:57,206;00:38:59,604;Stannis may take the city,
437;00:38:57,206;00:38:59,604;he may take the throne,
438;00:38:59,854;00:39:01,670;but he will not take us alive.
439;00:40:08,656;00:40:09,740;Get the ladders up!
440;00:40:43,546;00:40:46,152;Faster, you bastards!
440;00:40:43,546;00:40:46,152;Faster!
441;00:40:46,402;00:40:47,903;Come on, kill the scum!
442;00:40:50,294;00:40:51,930;Someone bring me a drink.
443;00:40:58,796;00:41:01,292;Fuck the water.
443;00:40:58,796;00:41:01,292;Bring me wine.
444;00:41:12,311;00:41:16,349;Can I get you some iced milk
444;00:41:12,311;00:41:16,349;and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?
445;00:41:16,985;00:41:18,059;Eat shit, dwarf.
446;00:41:18,985;00:41:20,686;You're on the wrong side of the wall.
447;00:41:20,936;00:41:22,626;I lost half my men.
448;00:41:24,228;00:41:26,275;The Blackwater's on fire.
449;00:41:26,525;00:41:29,153;Dog, I command you
449;00:41:26,525;00:41:29,153;to go back out there and fight.
450;00:41:33,574;00:41:35,451;You're kingsguard, Clegane.
451;00:41:35,701;00:41:38,079;You must beat them back
451;00:41:35,701;00:41:38,079;or they're going to take this city.
452;00:41:38,780;00:41:40,049;Your King's city.
453;00:41:42,308;00:41:43,668;Fuck the kingsguard.
454;00:41:45,327;00:41:46,379;Fuck the city.
455;00:41:48,091;00:41:49,006;Fuck the King.
456;00:43:01,954;00:43:04,749;The queen has sent me
456;00:43:01,954;00:43:04,749;to bring you back to the Red Keep.
457;00:43:07,523;00:43:09,545;If you won't defend your own city,
457;00:43:07,523;00:43:09,545;why should they?
458;00:43:10,436;00:43:12,506;What would you have me do?
458;00:43:10,436;00:43:12,506;Lead.
459;00:43:13,121;00:43:16,302;Get down there and lead your people
459;00:43:13,121;00:43:16,302;against the invaders.
460;00:43:17,245;00:43:19,221;What did my mother say exactly?
460;00:43:17,245;00:43:19,221;Did she have urgent business with me?
461;00:43:20,258;00:43:21,682;She did not say, Your Grace.
462;00:43:27,605;00:43:29,342;Ser Boros, ser Mandon,
463;00:43:29,592;00:43:33,005;stay with my Uncle and represent
463;00:43:29,592;00:43:33,005;the king on the field of battle.
464;00:44:02,898;00:44:04,574;Where is the King?
465;00:44:04,824;00:44:07,345;Why isn't he with us?
465;00:44:04,824;00:44:07,345;Who are we fighting for?
466;00:44:09,326;00:44:10,189;Who leads us?
467;00:44:10,993;00:44:12,537;I'll lead the attack.
468;00:44:13,351;00:44:14,151;I'll lead!
469;00:44:16,907;00:44:18,322;What are you talking about?
470;00:44:18,992;00:44:19,949;My helmet.
471;00:44:22,603;00:44:25,162;You will bear the King's banner.
471;00:44:22,603;00:44:25,162;Men, form up.
472;00:44:33,879;00:44:35,631;They say I'm half a man.
473;00:44:35,881;00:44:38,156;But what does that make
473;00:44:35,881;00:44:38,156;the lot of you?
474;00:44:38,722;00:44:42,763;The only way out is through the gates.
474;00:44:38,722;00:44:42,763;And they're at the gates.
475;00:44:43,013;00:44:45,224;There's another way out.
475;00:44:43,013;00:44:45,224;I'm going to show you.
476;00:44:46,067;00:44:48,727;We'll come out behind them
476;00:44:46,067;00:44:48,727;and fuck them in their asses.
477;00:44:56,235;00:44:59,738;Don't fight for your King
477;00:44:56,235;00:44:59,738;and don't fight for his Kingdoms.
478;00:45:01,144;00:45:03,450;Don't fight for honor.
478;00:45:01,144;00:45:03,450;Don't fight for glory.
479;00:45:03,700;00:45:05,911;Don't fight for riches,
479;00:45:03,700;00:45:05,911;because you won't get any.
480;00:45:06,420;00:45:08,655;This is your city
480;00:45:06,420;00:45:08,655;Stannis means to sack.
481;00:45:08,905;00:45:10,666;That's your gate he's ramming.
482;00:45:10,916;00:45:13,941;If he gets in,
482;00:45:10,916;00:45:13,941;it will be your houses he burns,
483;00:45:15,319;00:45:17,089;your gold he steals,
484;00:45:17,582;00:45:19,126;your women he will rape.
485;00:45:28,390;00:45:30,811;Those are brave men
485;00:45:28,390;00:45:30,811;knocking at our door.
486;00:45:32,447;00:45:33,522;Let's go kill them.
487;00:45:56,455;00:45:58,320;The battle is lost, Your Grace.
488;00:46:00,007;00:46:01,875;Stannis's troops are at the gates.
489;00:46:02,125;00:46:05,804;When the gold cloaks saw
489;00:46:02,125;00:46:05,804;the king leaving, they lost all heart.
490;00:46:06,985;00:46:08,390;Where is my son?
491;00:46:08,640;00:46:10,392;I want to escort him
491;00:46:08,640;00:46:10,392;back to the battle.
492;00:46:10,642;00:46:12,186;Why do I care what you want?
493;00:46:13,492;00:46:14,730;Bring me.
493;00:46:13,492;00:46:14,730;Now listen to me.
494;00:46:22,562;00:46:23,822;Don't be afraid.
495;00:46:24,072;00:46:27,577;The queen has raised the drawbridge.
495;00:46:24,072;00:46:27,577;This is the safest place we can be.
496;00:46:27,827;00:46:30,621;Joffrey's not hurt.
496;00:46:27,827;00:46:30,621;He's fighting bravely.
497;00:46:30,871;00:46:33,957;His knights have rallied behind him.
497;00:46:30,871;00:46:33,957;They will save the city.
498;00:46:35,155;00:46:36,669;Shall we sing a hymn?
499;00:46:37,800;00:46:39,797;Gentle mother
500;00:46:40,047;00:46:42,508;font of mercy
501;00:46:42,758;00:46:46,845;save our sons from war, we pray
502;00:46:47,095;00:46:48,006;gentle...
503;00:46:48,256;00:46:49,223;You must go.
504;00:46:49,744;00:46:51,100;Run to your chamber.
505;00:46:51,350;00:46:53,936;And bar your door.
505;00:46:51,350;00:46:53,936;Stannis won't hurt you.
506;00:46:54,445;00:46:55,760;This one will.
507;00:46:58,079;00:46:58,982;Come with me.
508;00:46:59,492;00:47:01,235;I need to say goodbye to someone.
509;00:47:01,485;00:47:03,320;The Queen said they'd rape everyone.
510;00:47:03,570;00:47:05,155;No one is raping me.
511;00:47:07,574;00:47:08,492;Go. Run.
512;00:47:48,539;00:47:50,784;The lady is starting to panic.
513;00:47:52,004;00:47:53,275;What are you doing here?
514;00:47:53,525;00:47:55,009;Not here for long.
515;00:47:55,842;00:47:56,790;I'm going.
516;00:47:57,040;00:47:57,958;Where?
517;00:47:58,752;00:48:00,996;Someplace that isn't burning.
518;00:48:03,428;00:48:04,798;North, might be.
519;00:48:05,481;00:48:06,506;Could be.
520;00:48:07,759;00:48:09,156;What about the King?
521;00:48:10,731;00:48:12,797;He can die just fine on his own.
522;00:48:19,207;00:48:20,752;I can take you with me.
523;00:48:22,221;00:48:23,849;Take you to Winterfell.
524;00:48:29,274;00:48:30,802;I'll keep you safe.
525;00:48:33,559;00:48:35,152;Do you want to go home?
526;00:48:39,135;00:48:40,641;I'll be safe here.
527;00:48:40,891;00:48:42,044;Stannis won't hurt me.
528;00:48:44,320;00:48:45,475;Look at me.
529;00:48:47,332;00:48:48,849;Stannis is a killer.
530;00:48:50,209;00:48:52,188;The lannisters are killers.
531;00:48:52,722;00:48:54,223;Your father was a killer.
532;00:48:55,032;00:48:57,032;Your brother is a killer.
533;00:48:58,767;00:49:00,604;Your sons will be killers someday.
534;00:49:02,989;00:49:05,184;The world is built by killers.
535;00:49:09,112;00:49:11,663;So you'd better get used
535;00:49:09,112;00:49:11,663;to looking at them.
536;00:49:15,532;00:49:17,158;You won't hurt me.
537;00:49:24,205;00:49:26,547;No, little bird, I won't hurt you.
538;00:49:58,203;00:50:00,445;Come on, you bastards!
538;00:49:58,203;00:50:00,445;Get up those ladders!
539;00:50:04,787;00:50:05,795;Attack!
540;00:50:20,433;00:50:21,560;Roll it over!
541;00:50:28,859;00:50:30,903;Halfman! Halfman!
542;00:50:44,717;00:50:45,834;Fuck me.
543;00:51:40,233;00:51:41,634;Be calm, my sweet.
544;00:51:41,884;00:51:43,429;They're still fighting.
545;00:51:45,705;00:51:47,413;No one's going to hurt you.
546;00:51:51,858;00:51:53,207;I'll tell you a story.
547;00:51:54,653;00:51:57,197;You know the one about the mother lion
547;00:51:54,653;00:51:57,197;and her little cub?
548;00:51:57,855;00:52:00,275;They lived in the woods.
548;00:51:57,855;00:52:00,275;The Kingswood?
549;00:52:00,525;00:52:01,761;Yes, my love.
550;00:52:02,786;00:52:06,046;In the Kingswood
550;00:52:02,786;00:52:06,046;there lived a mother and her cub.
551;00:52:06,296;00:52:08,208;She loved him very much.
552;00:52:10,158;00:52:13,000;But there were other things
552;00:52:10,158;00:52:13,000;that lived in the woods. Evil things.
553;00:52:13,250;00:52:14,374;Like what?
554;00:52:17,196;00:52:18,552;Like stags.
555;00:52:19,555;00:52:20,897;Stags aren't evil.
556;00:52:21,147;00:52:22,906;They only eat grass.
557;00:52:23,516;00:52:24,558;And wolves.
558;00:52:24,808;00:52:26,043;My lord.
559;00:52:26,293;00:52:28,603;He could hear them
559;00:52:26,293;00:52:28,603;howling in the night.
560;00:52:28,853;00:52:30,753;The little cub was frightened.
561;00:52:31,003;00:52:32,411;His mother said,
562;00:52:32,661;00:52:35,360;You are a lion, my son.
562;00:52:32,661;00:52:35,360;You mustn't be afraid.
563;00:52:49,167;00:52:51,557;For one day
563;00:52:49,167;00:52:51,557;all the beasts will bow to you.
564;00:52:51,807;00:52:53,092;You will be king.
565;00:52:55,455;00:52:58,227;All the stags will bow.
565;00:52:55,455;00:52:58,227;All the wolves will bow.
566;00:52:59,592;00:53:02,688;The bears in the north
566;00:52:59,592;00:53:02,688;and the foxes of the south,
567;00:53:04,506;00:53:07,270;all the birds in the sky
567;00:53:04,506;00:53:07,270;and the beasts in the sea...
568;00:53:10,030;00:53:12,404;they will all come to you,
568;00:53:10,030;00:53:12,404;little lion...
569;00:53:13,673;00:53:15,150;To rest a crown upon your head.
570;00:53:21,740;00:53:22,899;And the cub said,
571;00:53:23,149;00:53:26,078;Will I be strong and fierce
571;00:53:23,149;00:53:26,078;like my father?
572;00:53:27,454;00:53:29,706;Yes, said his mother.
573;00:53:29,956;00:53:33,043;You will be strong and fierce
573;00:53:29,956;00:53:33,043;just like your father.
574;00:53:51,544;00:53:54,441;I will keep you safe,
575;00:53:54,691;00:53:55,978;my love.
576;00:53:56,228;00:53:57,359;I promise you.
577;00:54:06,826;00:54:08,268;Back to the boats!
578;00:54:10,747;00:54:12,440;Stand and fight!
579;00:54:13,547;00:54:16,311;Stand and fight, damn you!
580;00:54:21,800;00:54:23,140;Father.
581;00:54:28,372;00:54:31,393;The battle is over.
581;00:54:28,372;00:54:31,393;We have won.
582;00:54:40,672;00:54:45,531;And who are you,
582;00:54:40,672;00:54:45,531;the proud lord said
583;00:54:45,781;00:54:49,537;that I must bow so low?
584;00:54:50,998;00:54:55,556;Only a cat of a different coat
585;00:54:55,806;00:54:59,530;that's all the truth I know
586;00:55:00,894;00:55:05,765;in a coat of gold or a coat of red
587;00:55:06,015;00:55:10,096;a lion still has claws
588;00:55:11,006;00:55:15,836;and mine are long and sharp, my lord
589;00:55:16,086;00:55:20,666;as long and sharp as yours
590;00:55:23,236;00:55:28,340;and so he spoke, and so he spoke
591;00:55:28,590;00:55:33,428;that lord of Castamere
592;00:55:33,678;00:55:38,462;but now the rains weep o'ver his hall
593;00:55:38,712;00:55:43,222;with no one there to hear
594;00:55:43,472;00:55:48,685;yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall
595;00:55:48,935;00:55:53,000;and not a soul to hear.
