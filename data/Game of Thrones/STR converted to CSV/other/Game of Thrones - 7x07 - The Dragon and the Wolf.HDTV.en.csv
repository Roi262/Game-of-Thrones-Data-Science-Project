2;00:00:09,088;00:00:12,628;It's an invitation...
2;00:00:09,088;00:00:12,628;to King's Landing.
3;00:00:12,629;00:00:14,128;You will represent my interests
4;00:00:14,129;00:00:15,753;at this gathering
4;00:00:14,129;00:00:15,753;as you see them.
5;00:00:15,754;00:00:18,213;It's not safe leaving you
5;00:00:15,754;00:00:18,213;with Littlefinger.
6;00:00:18,420;00:00:19,921;She's your sister.
7;00:00:20,296;00:00:21,712;Arya would never betray
7;00:00:20,296;00:00:21,712;her family.
8;00:00:21,921;00:00:24,441;She would if she
8;00:00:21,921;00:00:24,441;thought I was going to betray Jon.

9;00:00:27,545;00:00:29,629;I can become someone else.
10;00:00:30,213;00:00:34,213;I wonder what it would feel like
10;00:00:30,213;00:00:34,213;to be the Lady of Winterfell.
11;00:00:34,879;00:00:40,088;All I'd need to find out...
11;00:00:34,879;00:00:40,088;is your face.
12;00:00:43,545;00:00:45,045;Daenerys will win this war.
13;00:00:45,046;00:00:46,503;If you want Cersei
13;00:00:45,046;00:00:46,503;to bend the knee,
14;00:00:46,504;00:00:47,504;you can ask her yourself.
15;00:00:47,505;00:00:49,545;She has
15;00:00:47,505;00:00:49,545;a more important request.
16;00:00:50,420;00:00:52,087;Cersei thinks the army
16;00:00:50,420;00:00:52,087;of the dead is nothing
17;00:00:52,088;00:00:54,379;but a story.
17;00:00:52,088;00:00:54,379;What if we prove her wrong?
18;00:00:54,921;00:00:56,544;Bring the dead to her.
19;00:01:02,962;00:01:03,962;Go!
20;00:01:09,921;00:01:12,420;We are going to destroy
20;00:01:09,921;00:01:12,420;the Night King and his army.
21;00:01:13,004;00:01:14,754;Thank you, my queen.
22;00:04:13,754;00:04:15,961;Oil?
22;00:04:13,754;00:04:15,961;Pitch, my lord.
23;00:04:15,962;00:04:18,504;How many barrels?
23;00:04:15,962;00:04:18,504;500, my lord.
24;00:04:21,171;00:04:22,586;Get 500 more.
25;00:04:22,587;00:04:23,587;Yes, my lord.
26;00:04:36,046;00:04:39,003;I still enjoy it
26;00:04:36,046;00:04:39,003;when they call me my lord.
27;00:04:39,004;00:04:41,461;The thrill will fade.
28;00:04:41,462;00:04:42,962;If we live that long.
29;00:04:44,462;00:04:46,170;Men without cocks.
30;00:04:46,171;00:04:47,878;You wouldn't find me
30;00:04:46,171;00:04:47,878;fighting in an army
31;00:04:47,879;00:04:49,836;if I had no cock.
32;00:04:49,837;00:04:52,295;What's left
32;00:04:49,837;00:04:52,295;to fight for?
33;00:04:52,296;00:04:54,170;Gold?
34;00:04:54,171;00:04:56,003;I spent my life
34;00:04:54,171;00:04:56,003;around soldiers.
35;00:04:56,004;00:04:58,129;What do you think
35;00:04:56,004;00:04:58,129;they spend that gold on?
36;00:04:59,670;00:05:01,337;Family.
37;00:05:01,338;00:05:03,004;Not without a cock,
37;00:05:01,338;00:05:03,004;you don't.
38;00:05:04,379;00:05:07,171;Maybe it really is
38;00:05:04,379;00:05:07,171;all cocks in the end.
39;00:05:09,254;00:05:12,544;Yet, your brother has chosen
39;00:05:09,254;00:05:12,544;to side with the cockless.
40;00:05:12,545;00:05:17,419;Yes, he's always been
40;00:05:12,545;00:05:17,419;a champion of the downtrodden.
41;00:05:55,629;00:05:58,379;I think we're about to be
41;00:05:55,629;00:05:58,379;the downtrodden.
42;00:06:00,338;00:06:02,795;Archers, stand tall!
43;00:06:02,796;00:06:05,754;Cover that wall!
44;00:06:33,213;00:06:36,795;How many people live here?
44;00:06:33,213;00:06:36,795;A million, give or take.
45;00:06:36,796;00:06:40,920;That's more people than the
45;00:06:36,796;00:06:40,920;entire North crammed into that.
46;00:06:40,921;00:06:43,087;Why would anyone
46;00:06:40,921;00:06:43,087;want to live that way?
47;00:06:43,088;00:06:45,544;There's more work
47;00:06:43,088;00:06:45,544;in the city.
48;00:06:45,545;00:06:47,754;And the brothels
48;00:06:45,545;00:06:47,754;are far superior.
49;00:07:26,088;00:07:28,128;Why isn't she with them?
50;00:07:28,129;00:07:30,295;I'm afraid I don't know,
50;00:07:28,129;00:07:30,295;Your Grace.
51;00:07:30,296;00:07:32,461;No one has seen her.
52;00:07:32,462;00:07:34,128;And the rest of them?
53;00:07:34,129;00:07:36,378;They're on their way
53;00:07:34,129;00:07:36,378;to the Dragonpit now.
54;00:07:36,379;00:07:37,670;Including our brother?
55;00:07:39,338;00:07:40,462;Yes, Your Grace.
56;00:07:44,796;00:07:46,295;If anything goes wrong,
57;00:07:46,296;00:07:48,337;kill the silver-haired
57;00:07:46,296;00:07:48,337;bitch first,
58;00:07:48,338;00:07:51,628;then our brother, then the
58;00:07:48,338;00:07:51,628;bastard who calls himself king.
59;00:07:51,629;00:07:54,670;The rest of them you can kill
59;00:07:51,629;00:07:54,670;in any order you see fit.
60;00:07:56,088;00:07:57,461;Come, Ser Gregor.
61;00:07:57,462;00:07:59,629;It's time for us
61;00:07:57,462;00:07:59,629;to meet our guests.
62;00:08:08,379;00:08:10,544;Why did they build it?
63;00:08:10,545;00:08:12,170;Dragons don't understand
63;00:08:10,545;00:08:12,170;the difference
64;00:08:12,171;00:08:14,378;between what is theirs
64;00:08:12,171;00:08:14,378;and what isn't.
65;00:08:14,379;00:08:18,045;Land, livestock,
65;00:08:14,379;00:08:18,045;children...
66;00:08:18,046;00:08:20,586;Letting them roam free
66;00:08:18,046;00:08:20,586;around a city was a problem.
67;00:08:20,587;00:08:24,378;I imagine it was
67;00:08:20,587;00:08:24,378;a sad joke at the end.
68;00:08:24,379;00:08:27,836;An entire arena for a few sickly
68;00:08:24,379;00:08:27,836;creatures smaller than dogs.
69;00:08:27,837;00:08:31,337;But in the beginning, when it
69;00:08:27,837;00:08:31,337;was home to Balerion the Dread,
70;00:08:31,338;00:08:34,712;it must have been the most
70;00:08:31,338;00:08:34,712;dangerous place in the world.
71;00:08:40,379;00:08:43,046;Maybe it still is.
72;00:08:51,504;00:08:53,046;Welcome, my lords.
73;00:08:56,129;00:08:59,087;Your friends arrived
73;00:08:56,129;00:08:59,087;before you did.
74;00:08:59,088;00:09:01,962;I've been sent to escort
74;00:08:59,088;00:09:01,962;you all to the meeting.
75;00:09:25,420;00:09:28,419;A pleasant surprise
75;00:09:25,420;00:09:28,419;in an unpleasant situation.
76;00:09:28,420;00:09:31,087;I never thought I'd see
76;00:09:28,420;00:09:31,087;you again, my lord.
77;00:09:31,088;00:09:32,628;Supporting the enemy,
77;00:09:31,088;00:09:32,628;no less.
78;00:09:32,629;00:09:35,379;Hard to blame you.
78;00:09:32,629;00:09:35,379;Cersei will anyway.
79;00:09:36,670;00:09:38,087;I'm glad you're alive.
80;00:09:38,088;00:09:39,337;Come on!
81;00:09:39,338;00:09:40,796;You can suck
81;00:09:39,338;00:09:40,796;his magic cock later.
82;00:09:48,462;00:09:49,837;What's in there?
83;00:09:51,171;00:09:52,629;Fuck off.
84;00:10:02,296;00:10:03,961;I thought
84;00:10:02,296;00:10:03,961;you were dead.
85;00:10:03,962;00:10:06,128;Not yet.
86;00:10:06,129;00:10:08,462;You came pretty close.
87;00:10:09,796;00:10:12,420;I was only trying
87;00:10:09,796;00:10:12,420;to protect her.
88;00:10:13,837;00:10:15,711;You and me both.
89;00:10:15,712;00:10:17,628;She's alive.
90;00:10:17,629;00:10:18,796;Arya.
91;00:10:21,129;00:10:23,670;Where?
91;00:10:21,129;00:10:23,670;Winterfell.
92;00:10:25,670;00:10:28,669;Who's protecting her
92;00:10:25,670;00:10:28,669;if you're here?
93;00:10:28,670;00:10:30,170;The only one
93;00:10:28,670;00:10:30,170;that needs protecting
94;00:10:30,171;00:10:32,504;is the one that gets
94;00:10:30,171;00:10:32,504;in her way.
95;00:10:35,379;00:10:37,046;It won't be me.
96;00:10:40,171;00:10:42,253;Here we are...
97;00:10:42,254;00:10:44,795;the heroes of Blackwater Bay.
98;00:10:44,796;00:10:46,378;Strange place for a reunion.
99;00:10:46,379;00:10:48,253;It is, my lord.
100;00:10:48,254;00:10:51,337;I don't think I'm anyone's
100;00:10:48,254;00:10:51,337;lord anymore, Podrick.
101;00:10:51,338;00:10:53,920;Save the titles for
101;00:10:51,338;00:10:53,920;Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
102;00:10:53,921;00:10:56,836;I'm sure your new queen will
102;00:10:53,921;00:10:56,836;be happy to restore yours
103;00:10:56,837;00:10:58,295;if she ends up
103;00:10:56,837;00:10:58,295;on the throne.
104;00:10:58,296;00:11:00,419;You've been thinking
104;00:10:58,296;00:11:00,419;about our new queen?
105;00:11:00,420;00:11:04,753;Perhaps you've been
105;00:11:00,420;00:11:04,753;reconsidering your allegiances.
106;00:11:04,754;00:11:06,795;Remember my offer...
107;00:11:06,796;00:11:10,212;whatever they're paying you,
107;00:11:06,796;00:11:10,212;I'll pay double.
108;00:11:10,213;00:11:12,753;And that would be
108;00:11:10,213;00:11:12,753;double what now, exactly?
109;00:11:12,754;00:11:15,295;Don't you worry about me.
109;00:11:12,754;00:11:15,295;I'm doing all right.
110;00:11:15,296;00:11:17,628;Looking after myself.
110;00:11:15,296;00:11:17,628;Are you?
111;00:11:17,629;00:11:19,087;Helping me to arrange
111;00:11:17,629;00:11:19,087;this meeting
112;00:11:19,088;00:11:21,544;wasn't exactly looking
112;00:11:19,088;00:11:21,544;after yourself, was it?
113;00:11:21,545;00:11:23,337;You put yourself
113;00:11:21,545;00:11:23,337;at risk.
114;00:11:23,338;00:11:26,212;I put yourself at risk.
114;00:11:23,338;00:11:26,212;Important difference.
115;00:11:26,213;00:11:29,711;It's your head Queen Cersei's offered
115;00:11:26,213;00:11:29,711;a bag of gold for, it's not mine.
116;00:11:29,712;00:11:31,503;Now, thanks to me,
117;00:11:31,504;00:11:34,711;she's got two traitors' heads
117;00:11:31,504;00:11:34,711;coming right through her door.
118;00:11:34,712;00:11:37,170;She can lop them both off
118;00:11:34,712;00:11:37,170;as soon as she gets tired
119;00:11:37,171;00:11:40,045;of the clever words that
119;00:11:37,171;00:11:40,045;pour out their pieholes.
120;00:11:40,046;00:11:43,253;All thanks to Ser Bronn
120;00:11:40,046;00:11:43,253;of the fucking Blackwater.
121;00:11:43,254;00:11:46,545;If that's not looking after
121;00:11:43,254;00:11:46,545;myself, I don't know what is.
122;00:11:48,254;00:11:49,587;It's good
122;00:11:48,254;00:11:49,587;to see you again.
123;00:11:52,545;00:11:54,046;Yeah, you, too.
124;00:12:02,921;00:12:06,754;Anyone touches it,
124;00:12:02,921;00:12:06,754;I'll kill you first.
125;00:13:05,004;00:13:06,419;Come on, Pod.
126;00:13:06,420;00:13:07,920;Let's you and me
126;00:13:06,420;00:13:07,920;go have a drink
127;00:13:07,921;00:13:09,462;while the fancy folks
127;00:13:07,921;00:13:09,462;talk, eh?
128;00:13:38,670;00:13:40,503;I left this shit city
129;00:13:40,504;00:13:43,337;because I didn't
129;00:13:40,504;00:13:43,337;want to die in it.
130;00:13:43,338;00:13:45,629;Am I going to die
130;00:13:43,338;00:13:45,629;in this shit city?
131;00:13:46,712;00:13:47,795;You might.
132;00:13:47,796;00:13:51,212;And this is all
132;00:13:47,796;00:13:51,212;your idea.
133;00:13:51,213;00:13:54,544;Seems every bad idea has some
133;00:13:51,213;00:13:54,544;Lannister cunt behind it.
134;00:13:54,545;00:13:57,711;And some Clegane cunt
134;00:13:54,545;00:13:57,711;to help them see it through.
135;00:14:57,504;00:14:59,419;Remember me?
136;00:14:59,420;00:15:01,337;Yeah, you do.
137;00:15:01,338;00:15:05,419;You're even fucking
137;00:15:01,338;00:15:05,419;uglier than I am now.
138;00:15:05,420;00:15:07,921;What did they do
138;00:15:05,420;00:15:07,921;to you?
139;00:15:09,213;00:15:11,253;Doesn't matter.
140;00:15:11,254;00:15:13,461;That's not how it ends
140;00:15:11,254;00:15:13,461;for you, brother.
141;00:15:13,462;00:15:16,711;You know who's
141;00:15:13,462;00:15:16,711;coming for you.
142;00:15:16,712;00:15:18,796;You've always known.
143;00:15:33,338;00:15:34,338;Where is she?
144;00:15:35,754;00:15:36,878;She'll be here soon.
145;00:15:36,879;00:15:38,129;Didn't travel with you?
146;00:15:40,004;00:15:41,004;No.
147;00:17:35,921;00:17:37,920;We've been here
147;00:17:35,921;00:17:37,920;for some time.
148;00:17:37,921;00:17:40,213;My apologies.
149;00:17:49,504;00:17:51,170;We are all facing a unique...
150;00:17:51,171;00:17:53,212;Theon!
151;00:17:53,213;00:17:55,128;I have your sister.
152;00:17:55,129;00:17:57,545;If you don't submit
152;00:17:55,129;00:17:57,545;to me here, now...
153;00:17:58,962;00:18:00,338;I'll kill her.
154;00:18:06,088;00:18:08,544;I think we ought to begin
154;00:18:06,088;00:18:08,544;with larger concerns.
155;00:18:08,545;00:18:10,753;Then why
155;00:18:08,545;00:18:10,753;are you talking?
156;00:18:10,754;00:18:12,962;You're the smallest
156;00:18:10,754;00:18:12,962;concern here.
157;00:18:14,587;00:18:17,212;Do you remember when we
157;00:18:14,587;00:18:17,212;discussed dwarf jokes?
158;00:18:17,213;00:18:18,961;His wasn't even good.
159;00:18:18,962;00:18:20,295;He explained it
159;00:18:18,962;00:18:20,295;at the end.
160;00:18:20,296;00:18:21,836;Never explain.
160;00:18:20,296;00:18:21,836;It always ruins it.
161;00:18:21,837;00:18:23,337;We don't even
161;00:18:21,837;00:18:23,337;let your kind live
162;00:18:23,338;00:18:26,544;in the Iron Islands,
162;00:18:23,338;00:18:26,544;you know?
163;00:18:26,545;00:18:28,753;We kill you at birth.
164;00:18:28,754;00:18:30,795;An act of mercy
164;00:18:28,754;00:18:30,795;for the parents.
165;00:18:30,796;00:18:33,461;Perhaps you ought
165;00:18:30,796;00:18:33,461;to sit down.
166;00:18:33,462;00:18:34,920;Why?
167;00:18:34,921;00:18:37,129;Sit down or leave.
168;00:18:55,879;00:19:01,337;We are a group of people
168;00:18:55,879;00:19:01,337;who do not like one another,
169;00:19:01,338;00:19:03,879;as this recent
169;00:19:01,338;00:19:03,879;demonstration has shown.
170;00:19:05,379;00:19:07,669;We have suffered
170;00:19:05,379;00:19:07,669;at each other's hands.
171;00:19:07,670;00:19:11,045;We have lost people we love
171;00:19:07,670;00:19:11,045;at each other's hands.
172;00:19:11,046;00:19:13,337;If all we wanted
172;00:19:11,046;00:19:13,337;was more of the same,
173;00:19:13,338;00:19:15,586;there would be no need
173;00:19:13,338;00:19:15,586;for this gathering.
174;00:19:15,587;00:19:18,628;We are entirely capable of
174;00:19:15,587;00:19:18,628;waging war against each other
175;00:19:18,629;00:19:20,337;without meeting
175;00:19:18,629;00:19:20,337;face-to-face.
176;00:19:20,338;00:19:22,212;So instead, we should
176;00:19:20,338;00:19:22,212;settle our differences
177;00:19:22,213;00:19:24,878;and live together in harmony
177;00:19:22,213;00:19:24,878;for the rest of our days?
178;00:19:24,879;00:19:26,295;We all know
178;00:19:24,879;00:19:26,295;that will never happen.
179;00:19:26,296;00:19:27,670;Then why are we here?
180;00:19:30,004;00:19:33,046;This isn't about
180;00:19:30,004;00:19:33,046;living in harmony.
181;00:19:34,545;00:19:36,337;It's just
181;00:19:34,545;00:19:36,337;about living.
182;00:19:36,338;00:19:38,920;The same thing
182;00:19:36,338;00:19:38,920;is coming for all of us.
183;00:19:38,921;00:19:40,961;A general you can't
183;00:19:38,921;00:19:40,961;negotiate with.
184;00:19:40,962;00:19:44,711;An army that doesn't leave corpses
184;00:19:40,962;00:19:44,711;behind on the battlefield.
185;00:19:44,712;00:19:48,295;Lord Tyrion tells me a million
185;00:19:44,712;00:19:48,295;people live in this city.
186;00:19:48,296;00:19:51,711;They're about to become a million more
186;00:19:48,296;00:19:51,711;soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
187;00:19:51,712;00:19:54,420;I imagine for most of them
187;00:19:51,712;00:19:54,420;it would be an improvement.
188;00:19:58,587;00:20:00,004;This is serious.
189;00:20:01,462;00:20:03,170;I wouldn't be here
189;00:20:01,462;00:20:03,170;if it weren't.
190;00:20:03,171;00:20:05,003;I don't think
190;00:20:03,171;00:20:05,003;it's serious at all.
191;00:20:05,004;00:20:06,461;I think it's
191;00:20:05,004;00:20:06,461;another bad joke.
192;00:20:06,462;00:20:09,212;If my brother Jaime
192;00:20:06,462;00:20:09,212;has informed me correctly,
193;00:20:09,213;00:20:10,836;you're asking me
193;00:20:09,213;00:20:10,836;for a truce.
194;00:20:10,837;00:20:13,379;Yes.
194;00:20:10,837;00:20:13,379;That's all.
195;00:20:15,088;00:20:16,462;That's all?
196;00:20:17,837;00:20:19,419;Pull back my armies
196;00:20:17,837;00:20:19,419;and stand down
197;00:20:19,420;00:20:21,128;while you go
197;00:20:19,420;00:20:21,128;on your monster hunt.
198;00:20:21,129;00:20:23,711;Or while you solidify
198;00:20:21,129;00:20:23,711;and expand your position.
199;00:20:23,712;00:20:28,087;Hard for me to know which it
199;00:20:23,712;00:20:28,087;is with my armies pulled back
200;00:20:28,088;00:20:31,753;until you return and march on my
200;00:20:28,088;00:20:31,753;capital with four times the men.
201;00:20:31,754;00:20:36,088;Your capital will be safe until the
201;00:20:31,754;00:20:36,088;northern threat is dealt with.
202;00:20:37,504;00:20:38,795;You have my word.
203;00:20:38,796;00:20:40,920;The word of
203;00:20:38,796;00:20:40,920;a would-be usurper.
204;00:20:40,921;00:20:42,920;There is no conversation
205;00:20:42,921;00:20:46,961;that will erase
205;00:20:42,921;00:20:46,961;the last 50 years.
206;00:20:46,962;00:20:49,171;We have something
206;00:20:46,962;00:20:49,171;to show you.
207;00:23:04,670;00:23:07,254;We can destroy them
207;00:23:04,670;00:23:07,254;by burning them.
208;00:23:16,837;00:23:20,254;And we can destroy them
208;00:23:16,837;00:23:20,254;with dragonglass.
209;00:23:22,296;00:23:24,087;If we don't win
209;00:23:22,296;00:23:24,087;this fight,
210;00:23:24,088;00:23:28,088;then that is the fate
210;00:23:24,088;00:23:28,088;of every person in the world.
211;00:23:45,754;00:23:47,961;There is only one war
211;00:23:45,754;00:23:47,961;that matters...
212;00:23:47,962;00:23:50,296;the Great War.
213;00:23:51,420;00:23:52,796;And it is here.
214;00:23:57,004;00:23:59,129;I didn't believe
214;00:23:57,004;00:23:59,129;it until I saw them.
215;00:24:01,420;00:24:02,796;I saw them all.
216;00:24:05,504;00:24:06,711;How many?
217;00:24:06,712;00:24:08,129;A hundred thousand,
217;00:24:06,712;00:24:08,129;at least.
218;00:24:24,879;00:24:26,338;Can they swim?
219;00:24:27,504;00:24:28,628;No.
220;00:24:28,629;00:24:30,004;Good.
221;00:24:31,754;00:24:34,503;I'm taking the Iron Fleet
221;00:24:31,754;00:24:34,503;back to the Iron Islands.
222;00:24:34,504;00:24:36,586;What are you
222;00:24:34,504;00:24:36,586;talking about?
223;00:24:36,587;00:24:38,503;I've been
223;00:24:36,587;00:24:38,503;around the world.
224;00:24:38,504;00:24:40,878;I've seen everything,
224;00:24:38,504;00:24:40,878;things you couldn't imagine,
225;00:24:40,879;00:24:42,338;and this...
226;00:24:44,712;00:24:48,129;this is the only thing I've
226;00:24:44,712;00:24:48,129;ever seen that terrifies me.
227;00:24:55,462;00:24:57,378;I'm going back
227;00:24:55,462;00:24:57,378;to my island.
228;00:24:57,379;00:25:00,045;You should go
228;00:24:57,379;00:25:00,045;back to yours.
229;00:25:00,046;00:25:02,003;When winter's over,
230;00:25:02,004;00:25:04,670;we'll be the only ones
230;00:25:02,004;00:25:04,670;left alive.
231;00:25:14,129;00:25:16,171;He's right to be afraid.
232;00:25:17,462;00:25:19,128;And a coward to run.
233;00:25:19,129;00:25:21,378;If those things
233;00:25:19,129;00:25:21,378;come for us,
234;00:25:21,379;00:25:23,295;there will be
234;00:25:21,379;00:25:23,295;no kingdoms to rule.
235;00:25:23,296;00:25:25,711;Everything we suffered
235;00:25:23,296;00:25:25,711;will have been for nothing.
236;00:25:25,712;00:25:28,504;Everything we lost
236;00:25:25,712;00:25:28,504;will have been for nothing.
237;00:25:30,254;00:25:32,046;The crown accepts
237;00:25:30,254;00:25:32,046;your truce.
238;00:25:34,379;00:25:38,420;Until the dead are defeated,
238;00:25:34,379;00:25:38,420;they are the true enemy.
239;00:25:47,254;00:25:50,254;In return, the King in the
239;00:25:47,254;00:25:50,254;North will extend this truce.
240;00:25:52,462;00:25:54,461;He will remain in the North
240;00:25:52,462;00:25:54,461;where he belongs.
241;00:25:54,462;00:25:56,378;He will not take up arms
241;00:25:54,462;00:25:56,378;against the Lannisters.
242;00:25:56,379;00:25:58,795;He will not
242;00:25:56,379;00:25:58,795;choose sides.
243;00:25:58,796;00:26:01,087;Just the
243;00:25:58,796;00:26:01,087;King in the North?
244;00:26:01,088;00:26:03,544;Not me?
245;00:26:03,545;00:26:06,170;I would never
245;00:26:03,545;00:26:06,170;ask it of you.
246;00:26:06,171;00:26:07,753;You would never
246;00:26:06,171;00:26:07,753;agree to it.
247;00:26:07,754;00:26:10,254;And if you did, I would trust
247;00:26:07,754;00:26:10,254;you even less than I do now.
248;00:26:11,587;00:26:14,503;I ask it only
248;00:26:11,587;00:26:14,503;of Ned Stark's son.
249;00:26:14,504;00:26:18,046;I know Ned Stark's son
249;00:26:14,504;00:26:18,046;will be true to his word.
250;00:26:32,296;00:26:35,003;I am true to my word.
251;00:26:35,004;00:26:36,754;Or I try to be.
252;00:26:39,879;00:26:42,462;That is why I cannot
252;00:26:39,879;00:26:42,462;give you what you ask.
253;00:26:43,796;00:26:46,462;I cannot serve
253;00:26:43,796;00:26:46,462;two queens.
254;00:26:48,837;00:26:50,253;And I have already
254;00:26:48,837;00:26:50,253;pledged myself
255;00:26:50,254;00:26:54,004;to Queen Daenerys
255;00:26:50,254;00:26:54,004;of House Targaryen.
256;00:27:05,129;00:27:07,711;Then there is
256;00:27:05,129;00:27:07,711;nothing left to discuss.
257;00:27:07,712;00:27:10,711;The dead will come north first.
257;00:27:07,712;00:27:10,711;Enjoy dealing with them.
258;00:27:10,712;00:27:12,712;We will deal with
258;00:27:10,712;00:27:12,712;whatever is left of you.
259;00:27:21,171;00:27:22,836;Ser Jaime.
260;00:27:22,837;00:27:24,295;It's been good
260;00:27:22,837;00:27:24,295;to see you.
261;00:27:24,296;00:27:26,295;I imagine the next time
261;00:27:24,296;00:27:26,295;will be across a battlefield.
262;00:27:26,296;00:27:27,878;We both saw
262;00:27:26,296;00:27:27,878;what just happened.
263;00:27:27,879;00:27:29,628;We both saw
263;00:27:27,879;00:27:29,628;that... thing.
264;00:27:29,629;00:27:32,419;Yes, and I'm not looking forward
264;00:27:29,629;00:27:32,419;to seeing more of them.
265;00:27:32,420;00:27:34,087;But I'm loyal
265;00:27:32,420;00:27:34,087;to the queen,
266;00:27:34,088;00:27:36,003;and you're loyal to Sansa
266;00:27:34,088;00:27:36,003;and her dolt brother.
267;00:27:36,004;00:27:38,128;Oh, fuck loyalty!
268;00:27:38,129;00:27:39,669;Fuck loyalty?
269;00:27:39,670;00:27:43,212;This goes beyond houses
269;00:27:39,670;00:27:43,212;and honor and oaths.
270;00:27:43,213;00:27:44,712;Talk to the queen.
271;00:27:50,338;00:27:51,712;And tell her what?
272;00:28:02,545;00:28:04,213;I wish you
272;00:28:02,545;00:28:04,213;hadn't done that.
273;00:28:08,379;00:28:11,378;I'm grateful
273;00:28:08,379;00:28:11,378;for your loyalty,
274;00:28:11,379;00:28:15,461;but my dragon died
274;00:28:11,379;00:28:15,461;so that we could be here.
275;00:28:15,462;00:28:17,878;If it's all for nothing,
276;00:28:17,879;00:28:20,045;then he died
276;00:28:17,879;00:28:20,045;for nothing.
277;00:28:20,046;00:28:21,544;I know!
278;00:28:21,545;00:28:24,212;I'm pleased you bent
278;00:28:21,545;00:28:24,212;the knee to our queen.
279;00:28:24,213;00:28:26,920;I would have advised
279;00:28:24,213;00:28:26,920;it, had you asked.
280;00:28:26,921;00:28:28,878;But have you
280;00:28:26,921;00:28:28,878;ever considered
281;00:28:28,879;00:28:31,087;learning how to lie
281;00:28:28,879;00:28:31,087;every now and then?
282;00:28:31,088;00:28:32,088;Just a bit?
283;00:28:33,629;00:28:36,462;I'm not going to swear
283;00:28:33,629;00:28:36,462;an oath I can't uphold.
284;00:28:37,837;00:28:39,419;Talk about my father
284;00:28:37,837;00:28:39,419;if you want,
285;00:28:39,420;00:28:42,503;tell me that's the attitude
285;00:28:39,420;00:28:42,503;that got him killed.
286;00:28:42,504;00:28:45,586;But when enough people
286;00:28:42,504;00:28:45,586;make false promises,
287;00:28:45,587;00:28:48,753;words stop meaning
287;00:28:45,587;00:28:48,753;anything.
288;00:28:48,754;00:28:51,920;Then there are no more answers,
288;00:28:48,754;00:28:51,920;only better and better lies.
289;00:28:51,921;00:28:54,669;And lies won't help us
289;00:28:51,921;00:28:54,669;in this fight.
290;00:28:54,670;00:28:56,753;That is indeed a problem.
291;00:28:56,754;00:29:00,296;The more immediate problem
291;00:28:56,754;00:29:00,296;is that we're fucked.
292;00:29:01,504;00:29:02,920;Any ideas
292;00:29:01,504;00:29:02,920;as to how we might
293;00:29:02,921;00:29:04,921;change that state
293;00:29:02,921;00:29:04,921;of affairs?
294;00:29:06,296;00:29:07,753;Only one.
295;00:29:07,754;00:29:10,170;Everyone stays here,
296;00:29:10,171;00:29:12,961;and I go and talk
296;00:29:10,171;00:29:12,961;to my sister.
297;00:29:12,962;00:29:17,378;I didn't come all this way
297;00:29:12,962;00:29:17,378;to have my Hand murdered.
298;00:29:17,379;00:29:19,170;I don't want Cersei
298;00:29:17,379;00:29:19,170;to murder me either.
299;00:29:19,171;00:29:22,170;I could have stayed in my cell and
299;00:29:19,171;00:29:22,170;saved a great deal of trouble.
300;00:29:22,171;00:29:24,212;I did this.
301;00:29:24,213;00:29:26,711;I should go.
301;00:29:24,213;00:29:26,711;She'll definitely murder you.
302;00:29:26,712;00:29:30,088;I go see
302;00:29:26,712;00:29:30,088;my sister alone.
303;00:29:31,587;00:29:33,087;Or we all go home
304;00:29:33,088;00:29:34,837;and we're right back
304;00:29:33,088;00:29:34,837;where we started.
305;00:30:36,712;00:30:41,045;You spoke with her?
305;00:30:36,712;00:30:41,045;At her until she kicked me out.
306;00:30:41,046;00:30:44,128;She thinks I was an
306;00:30:41,046;00:30:44,128;idiot to trust you.
307;00:30:44,129;00:30:46,253;A lot of people seem to
307;00:30:44,129;00:30:46,253;think that, actually.
308;00:30:46,254;00:30:47,878;I'm about to step
308;00:30:46,254;00:30:47,878;into a room
309;00:30:47,879;00:30:49,669;with the most murderous
309;00:30:47,879;00:30:49,669;woman in the world
310;00:30:49,670;00:30:53,586;who's already tried to kill
310;00:30:49,670;00:30:53,586;me twice, that I know of.
311;00:30:53,587;00:30:55,213;Who's an idiot?
312;00:30:58,629;00:31:01,087;I suppose we should
312;00:30:58,629;00:31:01,087;say goodbye,
313;00:31:01,088;00:31:02,670;one idiot to another.
314;00:32:01,629;00:32:03,503;I shouldn't be
314;00:32:01,629;00:32:03,503;surprised, I suppose.
315;00:32:03,504;00:32:05,295;She's your kind of woman...
316;00:32:05,296;00:32:07,836;a foreign whore who
316;00:32:05,296;00:32:07,836;doesn't know her place.
317;00:32:07,837;00:32:11,628;A foreign whore you can't
317;00:32:07,837;00:32:11,628;abduct, beat, or intimidate.
318;00:32:11,629;00:32:13,337;That must be
318;00:32:11,629;00:32:13,337;difficult for you.
319;00:32:13,338;00:32:15,795;So you bring her here
319;00:32:13,338;00:32:15,795;with her pet Northerner,
320;00:32:15,796;00:32:17,711;whom you've convinced to bow down before her.
320;00:32:15,796;00:32:17,711;I didn't know about that.
321;00:32:17,712;00:32:19,795;And now you've got them both
321;00:32:17,712;00:32:19,795;working towards the same goal,
322;00:32:19,796;00:32:21,920;the goal you've worked
322;00:32:19,796;00:32:21,920;towards your entire life...
323;00:32:21,921;00:32:25,003;Cersei, I didn't know.
323;00:32:21,921;00:32:25,003;...the destruction of this family.
324;00:32:25,004;00:32:28,337;I am the one preventing
324;00:32:25,004;00:32:28,337;that from happening.
325;00:32:28,338;00:32:30,878;Daenerys didn't want
325;00:32:28,338;00:32:30,878;to debate and negotiate.
326;00:32:30,879;00:32:32,337;She didn't want
326;00:32:30,879;00:32:32,337;to bring you words.
327;00:32:32,338;00:32:34,295;She wanted to bring you
327;00:32:32,338;00:32:34,295;fire and blood
328;00:32:34,296;00:32:36,419;until I advised her
328;00:32:34,296;00:32:36,419;otherwise.
329;00:32:36,420;00:32:38,212;I don't want
329;00:32:36,420;00:32:38,212;to destroy our family.
330;00:32:38,213;00:32:40,170;I never have.
331;00:32:40,171;00:32:41,628;You killed our father.
332;00:32:41,629;00:32:43,253;After he sentenced me
332;00:32:41,629;00:32:43,253;to death
333;00:32:43,254;00:32:45,836;for a crime I didn't
333;00:32:43,254;00:32:45,836;commit, yes, I killed him.
334;00:32:45,837;00:32:47,503;Hate me for it
334;00:32:45,837;00:32:47,503;if you want.
335;00:32:47,504;00:32:49,836;I hate myself for it
335;00:32:47,504;00:32:49,836;in spite of what he was,
336;00:32:49,837;00:32:52,295;in spite of
336;00:32:49,837;00:32:52,295;what he did to me.
337;00:32:52,296;00:32:54,045;Oh, poor little man.
338;00:32:54,046;00:32:55,753;Your papa
338;00:32:54,046;00:32:55,753;was mean to you.
339;00:32:55,754;00:32:59,795;Do you have any idea what you did
339;00:32:55,754;00:32:59,795;when you fired that crossbow?
340;00:32:59,796;00:33:01,628;You left us open.
341;00:33:01,629;00:33:03,212;You laid us bare
341;00:33:01,629;00:33:03,212;for the vultures,
342;00:33:03,213;00:33:06,753;and the vultures came
342;00:33:03,213;00:33:06,753;and tore us apart.
343;00:33:06,754;00:33:08,419;You may not
343;00:33:06,754;00:33:08,419;have killed Joffrey,
344;00:33:08,420;00:33:10,337;but you killed Myrcella,
344;00:33:08,420;00:33:10,337;you killed Tommen.
345;00:33:10,338;00:33:12,378;No one would've touched them
345;00:33:10,338;00:33:12,378;if Father was here.
346;00:33:12,379;00:33:14,961;No one would have dared...
346;00:33:12,379;00:33:14,961;I have never been more sorry about anything.
347;00:33:14,962;00:33:16,669;I will not hear it,
347;00:33:14,962;00:33:16,669;not from you.
348;00:33:16,670;00:33:18,420;I will not hear it!
349;00:33:21,379;00:33:23,711;All right.
350;00:33:23,712;00:33:25,170;You love your family,
351;00:33:25,171;00:33:28,253;and I have
351;00:33:25,171;00:33:28,253;destroyed it.
352;00:33:28,254;00:33:31,003;I will always
352;00:33:28,254;00:33:31,003;be a threat.
353;00:33:31,004;00:33:32,338;So put an end to me.
354;00:33:41,171;00:33:43,378;If it weren't for me,
354;00:33:41,171;00:33:43,378;you'd have a mother.
355;00:33:43,379;00:33:46,128;If it weren't for me,
355;00:33:43,379;00:33:46,128;you'd have a father.
356;00:33:46,129;00:33:47,461;If it weren't for me,
357;00:33:47,462;00:33:49,544;you'd have
357;00:33:47,462;00:33:49,544;two beautiful children.
358;00:33:49,545;00:33:51,711;I've thought
358;00:33:49,545;00:33:51,711;about killing you
359;00:33:51,712;00:33:53,379;more times
359;00:33:51,712;00:33:53,379;than I can count.
360;00:33:55,088;00:33:57,379;Do it!
360;00:33:55,088;00:33:57,379;Say the word.
361;00:35:06,171;00:35:09,295;I am more sorry about the children
361;00:35:06,171;00:35:09,295;than you could ever know.
362;00:35:09,296;00:35:12,461;I will not...
362;00:35:09,296;00:35:12,461;I don't care. I loved them.
363;00:35:12,462;00:35:14,337;You know I did.
364;00:35:14,338;00:35:17,837;You know it in your heart if
364;00:35:14,338;00:35:17,837;there's anything left of it.
365;00:35:19,962;00:35:21,670;It doesn't matter.
366;00:35:23,629;00:35:27,253;Your love doesn't matter.
366;00:35:23,629;00:35:27,253;Your feelings don't matter.
367;00:35:27,254;00:35:29,419;I don't care
367;00:35:27,254;00:35:29,419;why you did what you did.
368;00:35:29,420;00:35:32,295;I only care
368;00:35:29,420;00:35:32,295;what it cost us.
369;00:35:32,296;00:35:33,670;It cost us our future.
370;00:35:35,338;00:35:37,461;If there's no future,
370;00:35:35,338;00:35:37,461;then why are we here?
371;00:35:37,462;00:35:39,461;Why did you
371;00:35:37,462;00:35:39,461;allow me to come?
372;00:35:39,462;00:35:42,503;Not to help my enemies
372;00:35:39,462;00:35:42,503;collaborate in my destruction.
373;00:35:42,504;00:35:44,253;Yes, no,
373;00:35:42,504;00:35:44,253;not what you hoped for,
374;00:35:44,254;00:35:46,796;but you must have
374;00:35:44,254;00:35:46,796;hoped for something.
375;00:35:47,837;00:35:50,378;What did you hope for?
376;00:35:50,379;00:35:54,045;To make Jon Snow submit to your queen?
376;00:35:50,379;00:35:54,045;Mm, not like this.
377;00:35:54,046;00:35:56,419;But eventually, you want everyone
377;00:35:54,046;00:35:56,419;to bend the knee to her.
378;00:35:56,420;00:35:58,170;Yes.
378;00:35:56,420;00:35:58,170;Why?
379;00:35:58,171;00:35:59,753;Because I think
380;00:35:59,754;00:36:01,586;she will make the world
380;00:35:59,754;00:36:01,586;a better place.
381;00:36:01,587;00:36:03,504;You said she'd destroy
381;00:36:01,587;00:36:03,504;King's Landing.
382;00:36:05,712;00:36:07,628;She knows herself.
383;00:36:07,629;00:36:09,170;She chose an advisor
384;00:36:09,171;00:36:12,503;who would check her worst
384;00:36:09,171;00:36:12,503;impulses instead of feeding them.
385;00:36:12,504;00:36:14,503;That's the difference
385;00:36:12,504;00:36:14,503;between you.
386;00:36:14,504;00:36:16,711;I don't care about
386;00:36:14,504;00:36:16,711;checking my worst impulses.
387;00:36:16,712;00:36:19,337;I don't care about making
387;00:36:16,712;00:36:19,337;the world a better place.
388;00:36:19,338;00:36:21,128;Hang the world.
389;00:36:21,129;00:36:23,586;That thing
389;00:36:21,129;00:36:23,586;you dragged here,
390;00:36:23,587;00:36:27,045;I know what it is,
390;00:36:23,587;00:36:27,045;I know what it means.
391;00:36:27,046;00:36:29,253;And when it came at me,
391;00:36:27,046;00:36:29,253;I didn't think about the world.
392;00:36:29,254;00:36:31,337;Not at all.
393;00:36:31,338;00:36:32,920;As soon as
393;00:36:31,338;00:36:32,920;it opened its mouth,
394;00:36:32,921;00:36:34,295;the world
394;00:36:32,921;00:36:34,295;disappeared for me,
395;00:36:34,296;00:36:36,419;right down
395;00:36:34,296;00:36:36,419;its black throat.
396;00:36:36,420;00:36:38,795;All I could think about was
396;00:36:36,420;00:36:38,795;keeping those gnashing teeth
397;00:36:38,796;00:36:40,337;away from the ones
397;00:36:38,796;00:36:40,337;who matter most,
398;00:36:40,338;00:36:42,128;away from my family.
399;00:36:42,129;00:36:45,753;Maybe Euron Greyjoy
399;00:36:42,129;00:36:45,753;had the right idea.
400;00:36:45,754;00:36:48,544;Get on a boat,
400;00:36:45,754;00:36:48,544;take those who matter...
401;00:36:48,545;00:36:49,712;You're pregnant.
402;00:37:22,171;00:37:24,878;No one is less happy
402;00:37:22,171;00:37:24,878;about this than I am.
403;00:37:24,879;00:37:26,296;I know.
404;00:37:28,962;00:37:31,461;I respect
404;00:37:28,962;00:37:31,461;what you did.
405;00:37:31,462;00:37:33,796;Wish you hadn't done it,
405;00:37:31,462;00:37:33,796;but I respect it.
406;00:37:44,462;00:37:47,962;This place was the beginning
406;00:37:44,462;00:37:47,962;of the end for my family.
407;00:37:54,171;00:37:56,296;A dragon
407;00:37:54,171;00:37:56,296;is not a slave.
408;00:37:59,129;00:38:01,586;They were terrifying.
409;00:38:01,587;00:38:03,296;Extraordinary.
410;00:38:04,712;00:38:07,753;They filled people
410;00:38:04,712;00:38:07,753;with wonder and awe,
411;00:38:07,754;00:38:10,004;and we locked them
411;00:38:07,754;00:38:10,004;in here.
412;00:38:11,296;00:38:12,837;They wasted away.
413;00:38:14,046;00:38:16,337;They grew small.
414;00:38:16,338;00:38:18,962;And we grew small
414;00:38:16,338;00:38:18,962;as well.
415;00:38:20,296;00:38:22,878;We weren't extraordinary
415;00:38:20,296;00:38:22,878;without them.
416;00:38:22,879;00:38:24,712;We were just like
416;00:38:22,879;00:38:24,712;everyone else.
417;00:38:29,754;00:38:31,670;You're not like
417;00:38:29,754;00:38:31,670;everyone else.
418;00:38:37,545;00:38:40,004;And your family
418;00:38:37,545;00:38:40,004;hasn't seen its end.
419;00:38:41,171;00:38:42,795;You're still here.
420;00:38:42,796;00:38:45,337;I can't
420;00:38:42,796;00:38:45,337;have children.
421;00:38:45,338;00:38:46,920;Who told you that?
422;00:38:46,921;00:38:49,878;The witch who
422;00:38:46,921;00:38:49,878;murdered my husband.
423;00:38:49,879;00:38:52,087;Has it occurred to you
423;00:38:49,879;00:38:52,087;she might not have been
424;00:38:52,088;00:38:53,879;a reliable source
424;00:38:52,088;00:38:53,879;of information?
425;00:38:59,712;00:39:01,836;You were right
425;00:38:59,712;00:39:01,836;from the beginning.
426;00:39:01,837;00:39:05,046;If I had trusted you,
426;00:39:01,837;00:39:05,046;everything would be different.
427;00:39:09,129;00:39:10,545;So, what now?
428;00:39:14,462;00:39:17,045;I can't forget what I saw
428;00:39:14,462;00:39:17,045;north of the Wall.
429;00:39:17,046;00:39:18,961;And I can't pretend
429;00:39:17,046;00:39:18,961;that Cersei
430;00:39:18,962;00:39:22,254;won't take back half the country
430;00:39:18,962;00:39:22,254;the moment I march north.
431;00:39:24,379;00:39:26,879;It appears Tyrion's
431;00:39:24,379;00:39:26,879;assessment was correct.
432;00:39:29,296;00:39:30,379;We're fucked.
433;00:40:23,545;00:40:25,629;My armies will not
433;00:40:23,545;00:40:25,629;stand down.
434;00:40:27,088;00:40:29,171;I will not pull them
434;00:40:27,088;00:40:29,171;back to the capital.
435;00:40:32,962;00:40:36,462;I will march them north to fight
435;00:40:32,962;00:40:36,462;alongside you in the Great War.
436;00:40:38,545;00:40:40,462;The darkness
436;00:40:38,545;00:40:40,462;is coming for us all.
437;00:40:42,254;00:40:45,212;We'll face it together.
438;00:40:45,213;00:40:48,003;And when
438;00:40:45,213;00:40:48,003;the Great War is over,
439;00:40:48,004;00:40:51,337;perhaps you'll remember
439;00:40:48,004;00:40:51,337;I chose to help
440;00:40:51,338;00:40:54,796;with no promises or
440;00:40:51,338;00:40:54,796;assurances from any of you.
441;00:40:58,171;00:41:00,213;I expect not.
442;00:41:02,629;00:41:04,378;Call our banners.
443;00:41:04,379;00:41:05,879;All of them.
444;00:41:18,879;00:41:22,128;It's not easy for
444;00:41:18,879;00:41:22,128;ravens to fly in these storms.
445;00:41:22,129;00:41:24,128;Perhaps Jon tried
445;00:41:22,129;00:41:24,128;to send word earlier.
446;00:41:24,129;00:41:27,544;No, this is
446;00:41:24,129;00:41:27,544;the way he is,
447;00:41:27,545;00:41:29,920;the way
447;00:41:27,545;00:41:29,920;he's always been.
448;00:41:29,921;00:41:32,544;He never asked for my opinion.
448;00:41:29,921;00:41:32,544;Why would he start now?
449;00:41:32,545;00:41:36,295;I can't believe he'd surrender the
449;00:41:32,545;00:41:36,295;Northern crown without consulting you.
450;00:41:36,296;00:41:38,711;This is his writing,
450;00:41:36,296;00:41:38,711;his signature.
451;00:41:38,712;00:41:41,878;He pledged to fight
451;00:41:38,712;00:41:41,878;for Daenerys Targaryen.
452;00:41:41,879;00:41:43,961;He's bent the knee.
453;00:41:43,962;00:41:46,544;I've heard gossip
454;00:41:46,545;00:41:50,544;that the Dragon Queen
454;00:41:46,545;00:41:50,544;is quite beautiful.
455;00:41:50,545;00:41:52,754;What does that have to do
455;00:41:50,545;00:41:52,754;with anything?
456;00:41:55,046;00:41:57,795;Jon is young
456;00:41:55,046;00:41:57,795;and unmarried.
457;00:41:57,796;00:42:00,003;Daenerys is young
457;00:41:57,796;00:42:00,003;and unmarried.
458;00:42:00,004;00:42:02,961;You think he wants
458;00:42:00,004;00:42:02,961;to marry her?
459;00:42:02,962;00:42:06,212;An alliance
459;00:42:02,962;00:42:06,212;makes sense.
460;00:42:06,213;00:42:08,420;Together, they'd be
460;00:42:06,213;00:42:08,420;difficult to defeat.
461;00:42:10,046;00:42:13,046;He was named
461;00:42:10,046;00:42:13,046;King in the North.
462;00:42:15,462;00:42:16,879;He can be unnamed.
463;00:42:20,712;00:42:23,378;Even if I wanted to,
463;00:42:20,712;00:42:23,378;Arya would never go along.
464;00:42:23,379;00:42:26,212;She always loved Jon far
464;00:42:23,379;00:42:26,212;more than she ever loved me,
465;00:42:26,213;00:42:29,419;and she'd kill anyone
465;00:42:26,213;00:42:29,419;who betrayed her family.
466;00:42:29,420;00:42:31,420;You are family, too.
467;00:42:33,420;00:42:36,003;Would Arya really murder
467;00:42:33,420;00:42:36,003;her own sister?
468;00:42:36,004;00:42:38,337;Do you know
468;00:42:36,004;00:42:38,337;what she is now?
469;00:42:38,338;00:42:41,711;Do you know what
469;00:42:38,338;00:42:41,711;the Faceless Men are?
470;00:42:41,712;00:42:43,920;Only by reputation.
471;00:42:43,921;00:42:47,087;They worship the God
471;00:42:43,921;00:42:47,087;of Death, I believe.
472;00:42:47,088;00:42:49,711;I never trust
472;00:42:47,088;00:42:49,711;godly men.
473;00:42:49,712;00:42:51,212;They're killers.
474;00:42:51,213;00:42:53,088;And Arya
474;00:42:51,213;00:42:53,088;was one of them.
475;00:42:57,962;00:42:59,544;What do you think
475;00:42:57,962;00:42:59,544;she's after?
476;00:42:59,545;00:43:02,128;She's your sister.
477;00:43:02,129;00:43:04,254;You know her far better
477;00:43:02,129;00:43:04,254;than I ever could.
478;00:43:07,796;00:43:12,544;Sometimes when I try to
478;00:43:07,796;00:43:12,544;understand a person's motives,
479;00:43:12,545;00:43:14,462;I play a little game.
480;00:43:16,962;00:43:18,962;I assume the worst.
481;00:43:21,962;00:43:24,795;What's the worst reason
481;00:43:21,962;00:43:24,795;they could possibly have
482;00:43:24,796;00:43:29,753;for saying what they say
482;00:43:24,796;00:43:29,753;and doing what they do?
483;00:43:29,754;00:43:31,961;Then I ask myself,
484;00:43:31,962;00:43:35,128;How well does
484;00:43:31,962;00:43:35,128;that reason explain
485;00:43:35,129;00:43:38,088;what they say
485;00:43:35,129;00:43:38,088;and what they do?
486;00:43:39,921;00:43:41,461;So, tell me...
487;00:43:41,462;00:43:44,004;what's the worst thing
487;00:43:41,462;00:43:44,004;she could want?
488;00:43:48,837;00:43:51,836;She could
488;00:43:48,837;00:43:51,836;want me dead
489;00:43:51,837;00:43:55,045;because she thinks
489;00:43:51,837;00:43:55,045;I wronged my family.
490;00:43:55,046;00:43:57,338;Why did she come
490;00:43:55,046;00:43:57,338;to Winterfell?
491;00:44:00,545;00:44:02,503;To kill me
492;00:44:02,504;00:44:06,337;for marrying our enemies
492;00:44:02,504;00:44:06,337;and betraying my family.
493;00:44:06,338;00:44:09,338;Why did she unearth the
493;00:44:06,338;00:44:09,338;letter Cersei made you write?
494;00:44:12,046;00:44:16,128;To provide proof
494;00:44:12,046;00:44:16,128;of my betrayals.
495;00:44:16,129;00:44:20,878;To provide justification
495;00:44:16,129;00:44:20,878;after she murders me.
496;00:44:20,879;00:44:24,544;And after
496;00:44:20,879;00:44:24,544;she murders you,
497;00:44:24,545;00:44:27,213;what does she become?
498;00:44:32,712;00:44:34,420;Lady of Winterfell.
499;00:44:49,462;00:44:52,378;If we have the Dothraki
499;00:44:49,462;00:44:52,378;ride hard on the kingsroad,
500;00:44:52,379;00:44:55,045;they'll arrive at Winterfell
500;00:44:52,379;00:44:55,045;within the fortnight.
501;00:44:55,046;00:44:56,544;And the Unsullied?
502;00:44:56,545;00:44:58,170;We can sail with them
502;00:44:56,545;00:44:58,170;to White Harbor,
503;00:44:58,171;00:45:00,878;meet the Dothraki here
503;00:44:58,171;00:45:00,878;on the kingsroad,
504;00:45:00,879;00:45:03,836;then ride together
504;00:45:00,879;00:45:03,836;to Winterfell.
505;00:45:03,837;00:45:07,087;Perhaps you should fly
505;00:45:03,837;00:45:07,087;to Winterfell, Your Grace.
506;00:45:07,088;00:45:09,586;You have many enemies
506;00:45:07,088;00:45:09,586;in the North.
507;00:45:09,587;00:45:11,836;Thousands fell
507;00:45:09,587;00:45:11,836;fighting your father.
508;00:45:11,837;00:45:15,544;All it takes is one angry
508;00:45:11,837;00:45:15,544;man with a crossbow.
509;00:45:15,545;00:45:17,753;He'll see your silver
509;00:45:15,545;00:45:17,753;hair on the kingsroad
510;00:45:17,754;00:45:20,795;and know that one well-placed
510;00:45:17,754;00:45:20,795;bolt will make him a hero.
511;00:45:20,796;00:45:23,420;The man who killed
511;00:45:20,796;00:45:23,420;the conqueror.
512;00:45:24,962;00:45:26,753;It's your decision,
512;00:45:24,962;00:45:26,753;Your Grace.
513;00:45:26,754;00:45:29,961;But if we're going to be
513;00:45:26,754;00:45:29,961;allies in this war,
514;00:45:29,962;00:45:34,045;it's important for the
514;00:45:29,962;00:45:34,045;Northerners to see us as allies.
515;00:45:34,046;00:45:37,212;If we sail
515;00:45:34,046;00:45:37,212;to White Harbor together,
516;00:45:37,213;00:45:39,462;I think it sends
516;00:45:37,213;00:45:39,462;a better message.
517;00:45:45,921;00:45:48,669;I've not come
517;00:45:45,921;00:45:48,669;to conquer the North.
518;00:45:48,670;00:45:51,004;I'm coming to save
518;00:45:48,670;00:45:51,004;the North.
519;00:45:56,629;00:45:57,962;We sail together.
520;00:46:13,129;00:46:14,129;Jon.
521;00:46:16,296;00:46:17,629;Can I speak
521;00:46:16,296;00:46:17,629;with you?
522;00:46:20,962;00:46:22,088;All right.
523;00:46:27,962;00:46:30,544;What you did
523;00:46:27,962;00:46:30,544;in King's Landing,
524;00:46:30,545;00:46:32,670;what you said...
525;00:46:34,837;00:46:38,253;you could've
525;00:46:34,837;00:46:38,253;lied to Cersei
526;00:46:38,254;00:46:41,171;about bending the knee
526;00:46:38,254;00:46:41,171;to Daenerys.
527;00:46:45,171;00:46:47,629;You risked everything
527;00:46:45,171;00:46:47,629;to tell an enemy the truth.
528;00:46:49,545;00:46:52,003;We went down there
528;00:46:49,545;00:46:52,003;to make peace.
529;00:46:52,004;00:46:55,503;And it seems to me we need
529;00:46:52,004;00:46:55,503;to be honest with each other
530;00:46:55,504;00:46:56,879;if we're going
530;00:46:55,504;00:46:56,879;to fight together.
531;00:46:58,420;00:47:00,879;You've always known
531;00:46:58,420;00:47:00,879;what was right.
532;00:47:04,379;00:47:07,669;Even when we were all
532;00:47:04,379;00:47:07,669;young and stupid,
533;00:47:07,670;00:47:09,170;you always knew.
534;00:47:09,171;00:47:11,420;Every step you take...
535;00:47:12,879;00:47:14,753;it's always
535;00:47:12,879;00:47:14,753;the right step.
536;00:47:14,754;00:47:15,878;It's not.
537;00:47:15,879;00:47:18,128;It may seem that way
537;00:47:15,879;00:47:18,128;from the outside,
538;00:47:18,129;00:47:21,545;but I promise you,
538;00:47:18,129;00:47:21,545;it's not true.
539;00:47:23,962;00:47:26,544;I've done plenty of
539;00:47:23,962;00:47:26,544;things that I regret.
540;00:47:26,545;00:47:28,253;Not compared to me, you haven't.
541;00:47:28,254;00:47:29,879;No.
542;00:47:31,712;00:47:33,504;Not compared to you.
543;00:47:44,754;00:47:47,379;I always wanted
543;00:47:44,754;00:47:47,379;to do the right thing.
544;00:47:50,046;00:47:52,128;Be the right
544;00:47:50,046;00:47:52,128;kind of person.
545;00:47:52,129;00:47:54,712;But I never knew
545;00:47:52,129;00:47:54,712;what that meant.
546;00:47:56,129;00:47:58,462;It always seemed
546;00:47:56,129;00:47:58,462;like there's...
547;00:48:02,545;00:48:04,962;like there was an impossible
547;00:48:02,545;00:48:04,962;choice I had to make.
548;00:48:07,420;00:48:09,213;Stark or Greyjoy.
549;00:48:12,462;00:48:17,087;Our father was more of a father
549;00:48:12,462;00:48:17,087;to you than yours ever was.
550;00:48:17,088;00:48:19,920;He was.
550;00:48:17,088;00:48:19,920;And you betrayed him.
551;00:48:19,921;00:48:21,795;Betrayed his memory.
552;00:48:21,796;00:48:22,796;I did.
553;00:48:27,796;00:48:29,545;But you never
553;00:48:27,796;00:48:29,545;lost him.
554;00:48:33,420;00:48:35,504;He's a part of you.
555;00:48:37,046;00:48:38,795;Just like
555;00:48:37,046;00:48:38,795;he's a part of me.
556;00:48:38,796;00:48:40,962;But the things
556;00:48:38,796;00:48:40,962;I've done...
557;00:48:42,670;00:48:45,420;It's not my place to
557;00:48:42,670;00:48:45,420;forgive you for all of it.
558;00:48:48,796;00:48:52,003;But what I can
558;00:48:48,796;00:48:52,003;forgive,
559;00:48:52,004;00:48:53,420;I do.
560;00:48:59,796;00:49:01,962;You don't need
560;00:48:59,796;00:49:01,962;to choose.
561;00:49:03,296;00:49:05,254;You're a Greyjoy...
562;00:49:07,462;00:49:08,796;and you're a Stark.
563;00:49:22,504;00:49:25,419;When I was
563;00:49:22,504;00:49:25,419;Ramsay's prisoner,
564;00:49:25,420;00:49:29,461;Yara tried
564;00:49:25,420;00:49:29,461;to save me.
565;00:49:29,462;00:49:33,003;She's the only one
566;00:49:33,004;00:49:34,962;who tried to save me.
567;00:49:42,046;00:49:44,212;She needs me now.
568;00:49:44,213;00:49:47,004;So, why are you
568;00:49:44,213;00:49:47,004;still talking to me?
569;00:50:01,254;00:50:02,711;Load up.
570;00:50:02,712;00:50:04,337;Load up, lads.
570;00:50:02,712;00:50:04,337;Go on.
571;00:50:04,338;00:50:06,670;Tide's coming in.
572;00:50:22,796;00:50:25,379;All of us chose
572;00:50:22,796;00:50:25,379;to follow Yara.
573;00:50:27,837;00:50:31,669;We left the Iron
573;00:50:27,837;00:50:31,669;Islands for Yara.
574;00:50:31,670;00:50:34,504;She would never
574;00:50:31,670;00:50:34,504;leave one of us behind.
575;00:50:37,379;00:50:39,087;We're not
575;00:50:37,379;00:50:39,087;leaving her behind.
576;00:50:39,088;00:50:40,544;Your sister's dead.
577;00:50:40,545;00:50:42,253;She's not dead.
577;00:50:40,545;00:50:42,253;She's dead.
578;00:50:42,254;00:50:45,128;Even if Euron hasn't cut her
578;00:50:42,254;00:50:45,128;throat yet, she's dead.
579;00:50:45,129;00:50:50,253;She's our queen.
579;00:50:45,129;00:50:50,253;She's your sister, and you left her to die.
580;00:50:50,254;00:50:51,754;I did.
581;00:50:54,129;00:50:57,003;I ran from my uncle.
582;00:50:57,004;00:50:58,419;I was a coward.
583;00:50:58,420;00:51:01,669;So, why in fuck's name
583;00:50:58,420;00:51:01,669;should we listen to you?
584;00:51:01,670;00:51:05,295;They say the dead
584;00:51:01,670;00:51:05,295;can't swim.
585;00:51:05,296;00:51:06,878;We're going
585;00:51:05,296;00:51:06,878;to sail east,
586;00:51:06,879;00:51:09,253;find a nice,
586;00:51:06,879;00:51:09,253;quiet island,
587;00:51:09,254;00:51:12,253;kill all the men, and take
587;00:51:09,254;00:51:12,253;their wives for ourselves.
588;00:51:12,254;00:51:14,669;We're done with all that.
588;00:51:12,254;00:51:14,669;Who says we are?
589;00:51:14,670;00:51:17,587;Yara did.
589;00:51:14,670;00:51:17,587;She made a pledge.
590;00:51:19,504;00:51:22,669;We're going
590;00:51:19,504;00:51:22,669;to find her,
591;00:51:22,670;00:51:25,462;and we're going
591;00:51:22,670;00:51:25,462;to set her free.
592;00:51:33,921;00:51:37,003;Run away,
592;00:51:33,921;00:51:37,003;little Theon.
593;00:51:37,004;00:51:38,962;It's what
593;00:51:37,004;00:51:38,962;you do best.
594;00:51:42,004;00:51:43,795;He needs to shut his mouth.
595;00:51:50,629;00:51:53,504;Hey!
596;00:51:55,545;00:51:59,753;Oh, yes!
597;00:51:59,754;00:52:02,504;That's more like it.
598;00:52:19,379;00:52:20,379;Stay down...
599;00:52:21,629;00:52:23,129;or I'll kill you!
600;00:52:33,670;00:52:37,171;I said stay down
600;00:52:33,670;00:52:37,171;or I'll kill you!
601;00:53:50,088;00:53:51,754;Not for me.
602;00:53:55,046;00:53:56,503;For Yara!
603;00:53:56,504;00:53:57,921;Yara!
604;00:54:43,504;00:54:45,962;Have my sister brought
604;00:54:43,504;00:54:45,962;to the Great Hall.
605;00:55:31,420;00:55:33,213;Are you sure
605;00:55:31,420;00:55:33,213;you want to do this?
606;00:55:36,046;00:55:39,295;It's not what I want.
606;00:55:36,046;00:55:39,295;It's what honor demands.
607;00:55:39,296;00:55:42,212;And what does honor demand?
608;00:55:42,213;00:55:45,087;That I defend my family
608;00:55:42,213;00:55:45,087;from those who would harm us.
609;00:55:45,088;00:55:48,712;That I defend the North from
609;00:55:45,088;00:55:48,712;those who would betray us.
610;00:55:50,962;00:55:52,670;All right, then.
611;00:55:54,088;00:55:55,379;Get on with it.
612;00:55:58,213;00:56:00,378;You stand accused
612;00:55:58,213;00:56:00,378;of murder.
613;00:56:00,379;00:56:03,212;You stand accused
613;00:56:00,379;00:56:03,212;of treason.
614;00:56:03,213;00:56:06,004;How do you answer
614;00:56:03,213;00:56:06,004;these charges...
615;00:56:08,420;00:56:10,254;Lord Baelish?
616;00:56:26,004;00:56:27,545;My sister asked you
616;00:56:26,004;00:56:27,545;a question.
617;00:56:32,254;00:56:33,754;Lady Sansa,
617;00:56:32,254;00:56:33,754;forgive me...
618;00:56:35,420;00:56:37,212;I'm a bit confused.
619;00:56:37,213;00:56:39,503;Which charges
619;00:56:37,213;00:56:39,503;confuse you?
620;00:56:39,504;00:56:41,544;Let's start with
620;00:56:39,504;00:56:41,544;the simplest one...
621;00:56:41,545;00:56:44,128;you murdered our aunt,
621;00:56:41,545;00:56:44,128;Lysa Arryn.
622;00:56:44,129;00:56:47,003;You pushed her through the Moon
622;00:56:44,129;00:56:47,003;Door and watched her fall.
623;00:56:47,004;00:56:48,879;Do you deny it?
624;00:56:50,921;00:56:52,419;I did it
624;00:56:50,921;00:56:52,419;to protect you.
625;00:56:52,420;00:56:54,461;You did it to take
625;00:56:52,420;00:56:54,461;power in the Vale.
626;00:56:54,462;00:56:57,753;Earlier, you conspired
626;00:56:54,462;00:56:57,753;to murder Jon Arryn.
627;00:56:57,754;00:57:00,253;You gave Lysa Tears of Lys
627;00:56:57,754;00:57:00,253;to poison him.
628;00:57:00,254;00:57:01,296;Do you deny it?
629;00:57:03,629;00:57:06,795;Whatever your aunt
629;00:57:03,629;00:57:06,795;might have told you...
630;00:57:06,796;00:57:09,129;she was
630;00:57:06,796;00:57:09,129;a troubled woman.
631;00:57:10,462;00:57:11,753;She imagined enemies
631;00:57:10,462;00:57:11,753;everywhere.
632;00:57:11,754;00:57:14,128;You had Aunt Lysa send
632;00:57:11,754;00:57:14,128;a letter to our parents
633;00:57:14,129;00:57:16,628;telling them it was the
633;00:57:14,129;00:57:16,628;Lannisters who murdered Jon Arryn
634;00:57:16,629;00:57:18,128;when, really,
634;00:57:16,629;00:57:18,128;it was you.
635;00:57:18,129;00:57:20,337;The conflict between
635;00:57:18,129;00:57:20,337;the Starks and the Lannisters,
636;00:57:20,338;00:57:21,836;it was you
636;00:57:20,338;00:57:21,836;who started it.
637;00:57:21,837;00:57:22,920;Do you deny it?
638;00:57:22,921;00:57:24,544;I know
638;00:57:22,921;00:57:24,544;of no such letter.
639;00:57:24,545;00:57:26,378;You conspired
639;00:57:24,545;00:57:26,378;with Cersei Lannister
640;00:57:26,379;00:57:30,087;and Joffrey Baratheon to
640;00:57:26,379;00:57:30,087;betray our father, Ned Stark.
641;00:57:30,088;00:57:32,628;Thanks to your treachery,
641;00:57:30,088;00:57:32,628;he was imprisoned
642;00:57:32,629;00:57:36,087;and later executed on
642;00:57:32,629;00:57:36,087;false charges of treason.
643;00:57:36,088;00:57:38,920;Do you deny it?
643;00:57:36,088;00:57:38,920;I deny it!
644;00:57:38,921;00:57:42,295;None of you were there
644;00:57:38,921;00:57:42,295;to see what happened.
645;00:57:42,296;00:57:44,253;None of you
645;00:57:42,296;00:57:44,253;knows the truth.
646;00:57:44,254;00:57:46,171;You held a knife
646;00:57:44,254;00:57:46,171;to his throat.
647;00:57:51,379;00:57:54,004;You said, I did warn
647;00:57:51,379;00:57:54,004;you not the trust me.
648;00:57:57,338;00:58:02,004;You told our mother this knife
648;00:57:57,338;00:58:02,004;belonged to Tyrion Lannister.
649;00:58:03,338;00:58:05,212;But that was another
649;00:58:03,338;00:58:05,212;one of your lies.
650;00:58:05,213;00:58:07,046;It was yours.
651;00:58:12,171;00:58:15,087;Lady Sansa, I have known
651;00:58:12,171;00:58:15,087;you since you were a girl.
652;00:58:15,088;00:58:17,753;I've protected you.
652;00:58:15,088;00:58:17,753;Protected me?
653;00:58:17,754;00:58:19,879;By selling me
653;00:58:17,754;00:58:19,879;to the Boltons?
654;00:58:21,213;00:58:23,544;If we could
654;00:58:21,213;00:58:23,544;speak alone,
655;00:58:23,545;00:58:25,088;I can explain
655;00:58:23,545;00:58:25,088;everything.
656;00:58:27,296;00:58:30,419;Sometimes when I'm trying to
656;00:58:27,296;00:58:30,419;understand a person's motives,
657;00:58:30,420;00:58:33,003;I play a little game.
658;00:58:33,004;00:58:34,670;I assume the worst.
659;00:58:36,046;00:58:37,961;What's the worst
659;00:58:36,046;00:58:37,961;reason you have
660;00:58:37,962;00:58:39,879;for turning me
660;00:58:37,962;00:58:39,879;against my sister?
661;00:58:41,712;00:58:43,795;That's what you do,
661;00:58:41,712;00:58:43,795;isn't it?
662;00:58:43,796;00:58:45,628;That's what
662;00:58:43,796;00:58:45,628;you've always done...
663;00:58:45,629;00:58:47,461;turn family
663;00:58:45,629;00:58:47,461;against family,
664;00:58:47,462;00:58:49,378;turn sister
664;00:58:47,462;00:58:49,378;against sister.
665;00:58:49,379;00:58:51,586;That's what you did
665;00:58:49,379;00:58:51,586;to our mother and Aunt Lysa,
666;00:58:51,587;00:58:53,795;and that's what
666;00:58:51,587;00:58:53,795;you tried to do to us.
667;00:58:53,796;00:58:55,128;Sansa, please.
668;00:58:55,129;00:58:58,961;I'm a slow learner,
668;00:58:55,129;00:58:58,961;it's true.
669;00:58:58,962;00:59:00,419;But I learn.
670;00:59:00,420;00:59:02,669;Give me a chance
670;00:59:00,420;00:59:02,669;to defend myself.
671;00:59:02,670;00:59:03,962;I deserve that.
672;00:59:09,796;00:59:11,378;I am Lord Protector
672;00:59:09,796;00:59:11,378;of the Vale
673;00:59:11,379;00:59:13,753;and I command you to escort
673;00:59:11,379;00:59:13,753;me safely back to the Eyrie.
674;00:59:13,754;00:59:15,046;I think not.
675;00:59:18,338;00:59:21,046;Sansa, I beg you!
676;00:59:22,545;00:59:24,586;I loved your mother since
676;00:59:22,545;00:59:24,586;the time I was a boy.
677;00:59:24,587;00:59:26,379;And yet,
677;00:59:24,587;00:59:26,379;you betrayed her.
678;00:59:28,420;00:59:31,586;I loved you.
679;00:59:31,587;00:59:33,213;More than anyone.
680;00:59:34,338;00:59:36,129;And yet,
680;00:59:34,338;00:59:36,129;you betrayed me.
681;00:59:38,754;00:59:40,503;When you brought me
681;00:59:38,754;00:59:40,503;back to Winterfell,
682;00:59:40,504;00:59:43,045;you told me there's no
682;00:59:40,504;00:59:43,045;justice in the world,
683;00:59:43,046;00:59:45,254;not unless
683;00:59:43,046;00:59:45,254;we make it.
684;00:59:47,254;00:59:51,669;Thank you for all your many
684;00:59:47,254;00:59:51,669;lessons, Lord Baelish.
685;00:59:51,670;00:59:53,962;I will never
685;00:59:51,670;00:59:53,962;forget them.
686;00:59:57,670;00:59:58,670;Sansa!
687;01:00:05,670;01:00:06,796;I...
688;01:00:29,879;01:00:31,337;Our men in King's Landing
689;01:00:31,338;01:00:33,003;will march north
689;01:00:31,338;01:00:33,003;in three days' time.
690;01:00:33,004;01:00:34,378;It'll take us a fortnight
691;01:00:34,379;01:00:35,711;just to gather supplies
691;01:00:34,379;01:00:35,711;for the train.
692;01:00:35,712;01:00:37,253;We don't
692;01:00:35,712;01:00:37,253;have a fortnight.
693;01:00:37,254;01:00:39,253;If the North falls, we fall.
693;01:00:37,254;01:00:39,253;Three days.
694;01:00:39,254;01:00:40,795;The remaining forces
694;01:00:39,254;01:00:40,795;in the Westerlands
695;01:00:40,796;01:00:42,503;will take
695;01:00:40,796;01:00:42,503;the river road east.
696;01:00:42,504;01:00:44,045;We'll meet at
696;01:00:42,504;01:00:44,045;Lord Harroway's Town
697;01:00:44,046;01:00:46,045;and march together
697;01:00:44,046;01:00:46,045;to Winterfell.
698;01:00:46,046;01:00:47,213;Ser Jaime.
699;01:00:48,338;01:00:49,711;Your Grace.
700;01:00:49,712;01:00:52,171;My lords, I need a
700;01:00:49,712;01:00:52,171;moment with my brother.
701;01:00:53,796;01:00:55,629;Your Grace.
702;01:00:58,837;01:01:02,669;What are you doing?
702;01:00:58,837;01:01:02,669;Preparing the expedition north.
703;01:01:02,670;01:01:05,253;Expedition north?
704;01:01:05,254;01:01:08,544;I always knew you were
704;01:01:05,254;01:01:08,544;the stupidest Lannister.
705;01:01:08,545;01:01:11,212;The Starks and Targaryens
705;01:01:08,545;01:01:11,212;have united against us,
706;01:01:11,213;01:01:13,337;and you want to fight
706;01:01:11,213;01:01:13,337;alongside them?
707;01:01:13,338;01:01:15,295;Are you a traitor
707;01:01:13,338;01:01:15,295;or an idiot?
708;01:01:15,296;01:01:17,253;You pledged our forces
708;01:01:15,296;01:01:17,253;to fight our common enemy...
709;01:01:17,254;01:01:18,711;I'll say whatever
709;01:01:17,254;01:01:18,711;I need to say
710;01:01:18,712;01:01:20,419;to ensure the survival
710;01:01:18,712;01:01:20,419;of our house.
711;01:01:20,420;01:01:23,170;You expect me to trust the
711;01:01:20,420;01:01:23,170;man who murdered our father?
712;01:01:23,171;01:01:26,753;You expect me to command our troops
712;01:01:23,171;01:01:26,753;to fight beside foreign scum,
713;01:01:26,754;01:01:28,253;to fight for
713;01:01:26,754;01:01:28,253;the Dragon Queen?
714;01:01:28,254;01:01:30,170;You saw it
714;01:01:28,254;01:01:30,170;with your own eyes.
715;01:01:30,171;01:01:32,544;You saw a dead man
715;01:01:30,171;01:01:32,544;trying to kill us.
716;01:01:32,545;01:01:34,378;I saw it burn.
717;01:01:34,379;01:01:36,212;If dragons
717;01:01:34,379;01:01:36,212;can't stop them,
718;01:01:36,213;01:01:39,253;if Dothraki and Unsullied
718;01:01:36,213;01:01:39,253;and Northmen can't stop them,
719;01:01:39,254;01:01:41,253;how will our armies
719;01:01:39,254;01:01:41,253;make a difference?
720;01:01:41,254;01:01:43,253;This isn't about
720;01:01:41,254;01:01:43,253;noble houses,
721;01:01:43,254;01:01:45,378;this is about
721;01:01:43,254;01:01:45,378;the living and the dead!
722;01:01:45,379;01:01:47,419;And I intend to stay
722;01:01:45,379;01:01:47,419;amongst the living.
723;01:01:47,420;01:01:50,628;Let the Stark boy and his
723;01:01:47,420;01:01:50,628;new queen defend the North.
724;01:01:50,629;01:01:52,836;We stay here
724;01:01:50,629;01:01:52,836;where we've always been.
725;01:01:52,837;01:01:55,379;I made a promise.
726;01:01:57,545;01:02:00,961;Our child
726;01:01:57,545;01:02:00,961;will rule Westeros.
727;01:02:00,962;01:02:05,836;Our child will never be born
727;01:02:00,962;01:02:05,836;if the dead come south.
728;01:02:05,837;01:02:07,419;The monsters are real.
729;01:02:07,420;01:02:09,544;The white walkers,
730;01:02:09,545;01:02:11,795;the dragons,
730;01:02:09,545;01:02:11,795;the Dothraki screamers...
731;01:02:11,796;01:02:15,795;all the frightening stories we heard
731;01:02:11,796;01:02:15,795;when we were young, they're all real.
732;01:02:15,796;01:02:17,503;So be it.
733;01:02:17,504;01:02:19,628;Let the monsters
733;01:02:17,504;01:02:19,628;kill each other.
734;01:02:19,629;01:02:21,878;And while they battle
734;01:02:19,629;01:02:21,878;in the North,
735;01:02:21,879;01:02:24,295;we take back the lands
735;01:02:21,879;01:02:24,295;that belong to us.
736;01:02:24,296;01:02:27,087;And then what?
736;01:02:24,296;01:02:27,087;And then we rule.
737;01:02:27,088;01:02:30,003;When the fighting in the
737;01:02:27,088;01:02:30,003;North is over, someone wins.
738;01:02:30,004;01:02:32,170;You understand that,
738;01:02:30,004;01:02:32,170;don't you?
739;01:02:32,171;01:02:35,669;If the dead win, they march
739;01:02:32,171;01:02:35,669;south and kill us all.
740;01:02:35,670;01:02:38,753;If the living win,
740;01:02:35,670;01:02:38,753;and we've betrayed them,
741;01:02:38,754;01:02:40,711;they march south
741;01:02:38,754;01:02:40,711;and kill us all!
742;01:02:40,712;01:02:43,711;The Targaryens and the Starks
742;01:02:40,712;01:02:43,711;already want to kill us all.
743;01:02:43,712;01:02:45,128;Most of them
743;01:02:43,712;01:02:45,128;will die in the North.
744;01:02:45,129;01:02:46,711;I faced them
744;01:02:45,129;01:02:46,711;in the field.
745;01:02:46,712;01:02:49,253;We can't beat them.
745;01:02:46,712;01:02:49,253;We can't beat their dragons.
746;01:02:49,254;01:02:50,795;How many dragons
746;01:02:49,254;01:02:50,795;did you see at the pit?
747;01:02:50,796;01:02:52,795;Two.
747;01:02:50,796;01:02:52,795;What happened to the third?
748;01:02:52,796;01:02:55,295;For all we know,
748;01:02:52,796;01:02:55,295;it's guarding her fleet!
749;01:02:55,296;01:02:58,628;She came here with her dragons and
749;01:02:55,296;01:02:58,628;her Dothraki and her Unsullied.
750;01:02:58,629;01:03:01,419;She came here to show us
750;01:02:58,629;01:03:01,419;all her power.
751;01:03:01,420;01:03:04,461;No, something happened.
751;01:03:01,420;01:03:04,461;The dragons are vulnerable.
752;01:03:04,462;01:03:07,003;We can't beat the Dothraki.
752;01:03:04,462;01:03:07,003;We don't have the numbers.
753;01:03:07,004;01:03:08,836;We don't have the support
753;01:03:07,004;01:03:08,836;of the other houses!
754;01:03:08,837;01:03:11,504;No, we have something better.
754;01:03:08,837;01:03:11,504;We have the Iron Bank.
755;01:03:13,504;01:03:17,461;You should've listened more when Father
755;01:03:13,504;01:03:17,461;spoke about the importance of gold.
756;01:03:17,462;01:03:19,628;Oh, I know
756;01:03:17,462;01:03:19,628;it's boring for you.
757;01:03:19,629;01:03:23,253;You just wanted to hunt
757;01:03:19,629;01:03:23,253;and ride and fight.
758;01:03:23,254;01:03:25,836;But I listened,
758;01:03:23,254;01:03:25,836;I learned.
759;01:03:25,837;01:03:29,836;Highgarden bought us the most
759;01:03:25,837;01:03:29,836;powerful army in Essos...
760;01:03:29,837;01:03:31,628;the Golden Company.
761;01:03:31,629;01:03:35,337;20,000 men, horses,
761;01:03:31,629;01:03:35,337;elephants, I believe.
762;01:03:35,338;01:03:37,003;The Golden Company
762;01:03:35,338;01:03:37,003;is not here.
763;01:03:37,004;01:03:38,378;They're in Essos.
764;01:03:38,379;01:03:42,337;How is a mercenary company
764;01:03:38,379;01:03:42,337;in Essos going to help us?
765;01:03:42,338;01:03:44,836;Do you really think
765;01:03:42,338;01:03:44,836;Euron Greyjoy turned tail
766;01:03:44,837;01:03:46,462;and sailed back
766;01:03:44,837;01:03:46,462;to the Iron Islands?
767;01:03:47,587;01:03:48,961;Do you think
767;01:03:47,587;01:03:48,961;he abandoned
768;01:03:48,962;01:03:52,212;the chance to marry
768;01:03:48,962;01:03:52,212;the queen?
769;01:03:52,213;01:03:54,545;No one walks away
769;01:03:52,213;01:03:54,545;from me.
770;01:03:56,379;01:03:58,045;He's sailing with
770;01:03:56,379;01:03:58,045;his fleet to Essos.
771;01:03:58,046;01:04:00,128;He's going to ferry
771;01:03:58,046;01:04:00,128;the Golden Company back here
772;01:04:00,129;01:04:01,670;to help us win
772;01:04:00,129;01:04:01,670;the war for Westeros.
773;01:04:04,213;01:04:07,378;You plotted with Euron
773;01:04:04,213;01:04:07,378;Greyjoy without telling me,
774;01:04:07,379;01:04:09,212;the commander
774;01:04:07,379;01:04:09,212;of your armies?
775;01:04:09,213;01:04:11,836;And you conspired
775;01:04:09,213;01:04:11,836;with Tyrion,
776;01:04:11,837;01:04:13,212;the man who murdered
776;01:04:11,837;01:04:13,212;our father,
777;01:04:13,213;01:04:14,544;without telling me,
777;01:04:13,213;01:04:14,544;your queen.
778;01:04:14,545;01:04:16,003;I didn't conspire
778;01:04:14,545;01:04:16,003;with him.
779;01:04:16,004;01:04:17,878;You met with him in secret
779;01:04:16,004;01:04:17,878;without my consent.
780;01:04:17,879;01:04:19,878;You planned to promote
780;01:04:17,879;01:04:19,878;my enemies' interests.
781;01:04:19,879;01:04:22,170;That is the definition
781;01:04:19,879;01:04:22,170;of conspiracy.
782;01:04:22,171;01:04:24,544;I pledged
782;01:04:22,171;01:04:24,544;to ride north.
783;01:04:24,545;01:04:26,378;I intend to honor
783;01:04:24,545;01:04:26,378;that pledge.
784;01:04:26,379;01:04:28,586;And that will be treason.
784;01:04:26,379;01:04:28,586;Treason?
785;01:04:28,587;01:04:30,836;Disobeying your queen's command,
785;01:04:28,587;01:04:30,836;fighting with her enemies.
786;01:04:30,837;01:04:32,171;What would you
786;01:04:30,837;01:04:32,171;call it?
787;01:04:34,171;01:04:36,046;Doesn't matter
787;01:04:34,171;01:04:36,046;what I'd call it.
788;01:04:43,004;01:04:45,754;I told you no one
788;01:04:43,004;01:04:45,754;walks away from me.
789;01:04:48,088;01:04:50,629;Are you going to
789;01:04:48,088;01:04:50,629;order him to kill me?
790;01:04:52,754;01:04:54,711;I'm the only one
790;01:04:52,754;01:04:54,711;you have left.
791;01:04:54,712;01:04:57,170;Our children are gone,
791;01:04:54,712;01:04:57,170;our father is gone.
792;01:04:57,171;01:04:58,920;It's just
792;01:04:57,171;01:04:58,920;me and you now.
793;01:04:58,921;01:05:00,921;There's one more
793;01:04:58,921;01:05:00,921;yet to come.
794;01:05:03,921;01:05:05,921;Give the order, then.
795;01:05:25,296;01:05:27,004;I don't
795;01:05:25,296;01:05:27,004;believe you.
796;01:07:14,921;01:07:17,420;Come in.
797;01:07:21,420;01:07:22,878;Samwell Tarly.
798;01:07:22,879;01:07:25,087;I wasn't sure
798;01:07:22,879;01:07:25,087;if you'd remember me.
799;01:07:25,088;01:07:26,921;I remember everything.
800;01:07:35,088;01:07:37,253;You helped us
800;01:07:35,088;01:07:37,253;get beyond the Wall.
801;01:07:37,254;01:07:39,795;You're a good man.
801;01:07:37,254;01:07:39,795;Oh, well, thank you,
802;01:07:39,796;01:07:42,420;but, um, I'm not sure
802;01:07:39,796;01:07:42,420;that I am.
803;01:07:46,587;01:07:48,754;What happened to you
803;01:07:46,587;01:07:48,754;beyond the Wall?
804;01:07:50,171;01:07:51,754;I became
804;01:07:50,171;01:07:51,754;the Three-Eyed Raven.
805;01:07:53,379;01:07:54,462;Oh!
806;01:07:57,754;01:08:00,128;I don't know
806;01:07:57,754;01:08:00,128;what that means.
807;01:08:00,129;01:08:02,878;I can see things
807;01:08:00,129;01:08:02,878;that happened in the past.
808;01:08:02,879;01:08:06,961;I can see things
808;01:08:02,879;01:08:06,961;happening now
809;01:08:06,962;01:08:08,462;all over the world.
810;01:08:09,879;01:08:12,296;Why did you come
810;01:08:09,879;01:08:12,296;to Winterfell?
811;01:08:13,587;01:08:14,962;Um...
812;01:08:17,171;01:08:19,337;Jon's the one to lead
812;01:08:17,171;01:08:19,337;the fight against the dead.
813;01:08:19,338;01:08:21,419;I know he is.
814;01:08:21,420;01:08:23,378;But he can't
814;01:08:21,420;01:08:23,378;do it alone,
815;01:08:23,379;01:08:26,253;so I've come here
815;01:08:23,379;01:08:26,253;to help him.
816;01:08:26,254;01:08:29,128;He's on his way
816;01:08:26,254;01:08:29,128;back to Winterfell
817;01:08:29,129;01:08:30,754;with Daenerys Targaryen.
818;01:08:31,921;01:08:34,961;You...
818;01:08:31,921;01:08:34,961;you saw this in...
819;01:08:34,962;01:08:36,629;in a vision?
820;01:08:39,629;01:08:40,837;Oh.
821;01:08:43,629;01:08:45,837;He needs to know
821;01:08:43,629;01:08:45,837;the truth.
822;01:08:47,088;01:08:48,378;The truth
822;01:08:47,088;01:08:48,378;about what?
823;01:08:48,379;01:08:50,170;About himself.
824;01:08:50,171;01:08:53,711;No one knows.
824;01:08:50,171;01:08:53,711;No one but me.
825;01:08:53,712;01:08:56,669;Jon isn't really
825;01:08:53,712;01:08:56,669;my father's son.
826;01:08:56,670;01:09:00,836;He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen
826;01:08:56,670;01:09:00,836;and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.
827;01:09:00,837;01:09:04,669;He was born
827;01:09:00,837;01:09:04,669;in a tower in Dorne.
828;01:09:04,670;01:09:07,128;His last name
828;01:09:04,670;01:09:07,128;isn't really Snow,
829;01:09:07,129;01:09:08,129;it's Sand.
830;01:09:10,504;01:09:11,504;It's not.
831;01:09:13,088;01:09:15,503;Dornish bastards
831;01:09:13,088;01:09:15,503;are named Sand.
832;01:09:15,504;01:09:19,128;At the Citadel, I transcribed
832;01:09:15,504;01:09:19,128;a High Septon's diary.
833;01:09:19,129;01:09:21,879;He annulled Rhaegar's
833;01:09:19,129;01:09:21,879;marriage to Elia.
834;01:09:23,670;01:09:26,587;He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna
834;01:09:23,670;01:09:26,587;in a secret ceremony.
835;01:09:27,879;01:09:29,337;Are you certain?
836;01:09:29,338;01:09:32,045;It's what the High Septon
836;01:09:29,338;01:09:32,045;wrote in his private diary.
837;01:09:32,046;01:09:33,879;I don't know
837;01:09:32,046;01:09:33,879;why he'd lie.
838;01:09:35,712;01:09:38,254;Is this something
838;01:09:35,712;01:09:38,254;you can see?
839;01:09:39,712;01:09:43,544;Father, Smith, Warrior,
840;01:09:43,545;01:09:48,419;Mother, Maiden,
840;01:09:43,545;01:09:48,419;Crone, Stranger.
841;01:09:48,420;01:09:52,212;I am hers and she is mine...
841;01:09:48,420;01:09:52,212;I am his and he is mine...
842;01:09:52,213;01:09:56,544;from this day
842;01:09:52,213;01:09:56,544;until the end of my days.
843;01:09:56,545;01:09:59,670;Robert's
843;01:09:56,545;01:09:59,670;Rebellion was built on a lie.
844;01:10:01,796;01:10:04,921;Rhaegar didn't
844;01:10:01,796;01:10:04,921;kidnap my aunt or rape her.
845;01:10:14,504;01:10:16,046;He loved her.
846;01:10:23,796;01:10:25,420;And she loved him.
847;01:10:51,837;01:10:54,796;And Jon...
848;01:10:56,837;01:10:58,629;Jon's real name...
849;01:11:00,629;01:11:04,961;His name
849;01:11:00,629;01:11:04,961;is Aegon Targaryen.
850;01:11:04,962;01:11:07,171;You have
850;01:11:04,962;01:11:07,171;to protect him.
851;01:11:08,670;01:11:10,587;Promise me, Ned.
852;01:11:33,379;01:11:35,670;He's never been a bastard.
853;01:11:39,587;01:11:42,296;He's the
853;01:11:39,587;01:11:42,296;heir to the Iron Throne.
854;01:11:57,129;01:11:58,837;He needs to know.
855;01:12:02,046;01:12:03,837;We need to tell him.
856;01:12:14,171;01:12:16,878;Are you
856;01:12:14,171;01:12:16,878;all right?
857;01:12:16,879;01:12:18,795;It's just strange.
858;01:12:18,796;01:12:22,754;In his own horrible way,
858;01:12:18,796;01:12:22,754;I believe he loved me.
859;01:12:26,712;01:12:28,253;You did
859;01:12:26,712;01:12:28,253;the right thing.
860;01:12:28,254;01:12:30,795;You did it.
861;01:12:30,796;01:12:32,628;I'm just
861;01:12:30,796;01:12:32,628;the executioner.
862;01:12:32,629;01:12:34,379;You passed
862;01:12:32,629;01:12:34,379;the sentence.
863;01:12:36,545;01:12:39,378;You're the Lady
863;01:12:36,545;01:12:39,378;of Winterfell.
864;01:12:39,379;01:12:40,754;Does that bother you?
865;01:12:43,338;01:12:46,213;I was never going to be
865;01:12:43,338;01:12:46,213;as good a lady as you.
866;01:12:47,670;01:12:49,171;So I had to be
866;01:12:47,670;01:12:49,171;something else.
867;01:12:51,379;01:12:54,128;I never could have survived
867;01:12:51,379;01:12:54,128;what you survived.
868;01:12:54,129;01:12:56,461;You would have.
869;01:12:56,462;01:12:58,462;You're the strongest
869;01:12:56,462;01:12:58,462;person I know.
870;01:13:02,545;01:13:05,088;I believe that's the nicest
870;01:13:02,545;01:13:05,088;thing you've ever said to me.
871;01:13:06,670;01:13:10,461;Well, don't get
871;01:13:06,670;01:13:10,461;used to it.
872;01:13:10,462;01:13:12,712;You're still very
872;01:13:10,462;01:13:12,712;strange and annoying.
873;01:13:19,213;01:13:21,213;In winter, we must
873;01:13:19,213;01:13:21,213;protect ourselves.
874;01:13:22,754;01:13:24,796;Look after
874;01:13:22,754;01:13:24,796;one another.
875;01:13:26,921;01:13:28,629;Father.
876;01:13:31,754;01:13:35,920;When the snows fall
876;01:13:31,754;01:13:35,920;and the white winds blow,
877;01:13:35,921;01:13:37,878;the lone wolf dies,
878;01:13:37,879;01:13:40,338;but the pack survives.
879;01:13:47,338;01:13:48,629;I miss him.
880;01:13:51,962;01:13:53,462;Me, too.
881;01:15:15,088;01:15:17,212;It's a long way down.
882;01:15:17,213;01:15:21,046;Yeah. The crows keep telling
882;01:15:17,213;01:15:21,046;me I'll get used to it.
883;01:15:29,796;01:15:32,836;I can see movement...
884;01:15:32,837;01:15:35,545;Watch, on the tree line!
885;01:15:36,670;01:15:38,378;What is it?
886;01:17:09,545;01:17:10,670;Come on!
