121;00:10:02,791;00:10:05,125;My dear brother,
121;00:10:02,791;00:10:05,125;you wound me.
122;00:10:05,160;00:10:07,728;You know how much
122;00:10:05,160;00:10:07,728;I love my family.
123;00:10:26,948;00:10:28,182;Please.
124;00:10:28,216;00:10:31,618;Oh, I would have
124;00:10:28,216;00:10:31,618;dressed, your Grace.
125;00:10:31,653;00:10:34,121;This is your home.
125;00:10:31,653;00:10:34,121;I'm your guest.
126;00:10:37,292;00:10:39,326;Handsome one, isn't he?
127;00:10:39,360;00:10:44,164;I lost my first boy,
127;00:10:39,360;00:10:44,164;a little black-haired beauty.
128;00:10:44,199;00:10:47,301;He was a fighter too--
129;00:10:47,335;00:10:50,671;tried to beat the fever
129;00:10:47,335;00:10:50,671;that took him.
130;00:10:50,738;00:10:52,973;Forgive me.
131;00:10:53,007;00:10:55,008;It's the last thing you
131;00:10:53,007;00:10:55,008;need to hear right now.
132;00:10:55,043;00:10:57,277;I never knew.
133;00:10:57,312;00:10:59,146;It was years ago.
134;00:11:00,715;00:11:03,684;Robert was crazed, beat
134;00:11:00,715;00:11:03,684;his hands bloody on the wall,
135;00:11:03,751;00:11:07,588;all the things men do to show
135;00:11:03,751;00:11:07,588;you how much they care.
136;00:11:12,460;00:11:14,661;The boy looked
136;00:11:12,460;00:11:14,661;just like him.
137;00:11:16,331;00:11:19,032;Such a little thing...
138;00:11:19,100;00:11:21,935;A bird without feathers.
139;00:11:24,105;00:11:28,942;They came to take his body away
139;00:11:24,105;00:11:28,942;and Robert held me.
140;00:11:28,943;00:11:31,076;I screamed and I battled,
140;00:11:28,943;00:11:31,076;but he held me.
141;00:11:36,317;00:11:38,318;That little bundle.
142;00:11:40,121;00:11:42,589;They took him away
142;00:11:40,121;00:11:42,589;and I never saw him again.
143;00:11:42,624;00:11:44,958;Never have visited
143;00:11:42,624;00:11:44,958;the crypt, never.
144;00:11:55,570;00:11:57,604;I pray to the mother
144;00:11:55,570;00:11:57,604;every morning and night
145;00:11:57,639;00:11:59,873;that she return
145;00:11:57,639;00:11:59,873;your child to you.
146;00:12:01,843;00:12:03,544;I am grateful.
147;00:12:03,578;00:12:06,647;Perhaps this time
147;00:12:03,578;00:12:06,647;she'll listen.
148;00:12:57,699;00:12:59,733;A sword for the wall?
149;00:13:01,869;00:13:04,471;I already have one.
149;00:13:01,869;00:13:04,471;Good man.
150;00:13:04,505;00:13:07,708;Have you swung it yet?
150;00:13:04,505;00:13:07,708;Of course I have.
151;00:13:07,742;00:13:09,376;At someone, I mean.
152;00:13:13,948;00:13:17,050;It's a strange thing,
152;00:13:13,948;00:13:17,050;the first time you cut a man.
153;00:13:17,085;00:13:20,253;You realize we're nothing
153;00:13:17,085;00:13:20,253;but sacks of meat
154;00:13:20,288;00:13:23,724;and blood and some bone
154;00:13:20,288;00:13:23,724;to keep it all standing.
155;00:13:25,927;00:13:28,095;Let me thank you
155;00:13:25,927;00:13:28,095;ahead of time
156;00:13:28,129;00:13:30,964;for guarding us all from
156;00:13:28,129;00:13:30,964;the perils beyond the wall--
157;00:13:30,999;00:13:33,600;Wildlings and White Walkers
157;00:13:30,999;00:13:33,600;and whatnot.
158;00:13:35,737;00:13:37,371;We're grateful to have
159;00:13:37,405;00:13:39,773;good, strong men like you
159;00:13:37,405;00:13:39,773;protecting us.
160;00:13:42,310;00:13:45,078;We've guarded the kingdoms
160;00:13:42,310;00:13:45,078;for 8,000 years.
161;00:13:47,749;00:13:50,283;Is it we already?
162;00:13:51,819;00:13:53,487;Have you taken
162;00:13:51,819;00:13:53,487;your vows then?
163;00:13:53,521;00:13:54,788;Soon enough.
164;00:13:57,091;00:13:59,359;Give my regards
164;00:13:57,091;00:13:59,359;to The Night's Watch.
165;00:13:59,394;00:14:02,829;I'm sure it will be thrilling
165;00:13:59,394;00:14:02,829;to serve in such an elite force.
166;00:14:02,864;00:14:04,798;And if not?
167;00:14:04,832;00:14:07,701;It's only for life.
168;00:14:26,387;00:14:28,455;Thank you, Nymeria.
169;00:14:35,163;00:14:38,131;Septa Mordane says
169;00:14:35,163;00:14:38,131;I have to do it again.
170;00:14:38,166;00:14:40,801;My things weren't
170;00:14:38,166;00:14:40,801;properly folded, she says.
171;00:14:40,835;00:14:42,574;Who cares how they're folded?!
172;00:14:42,575;00:14:44,000;They're going to get all
172;00:14:42,575;00:14:44,000;messed up anyway.
173;00:14:45,207;00:14:46,373;It's good
173;00:14:45,207;00:14:46,373;you've got help.
174;00:14:46,374;00:14:48,208;Watch.
175;00:14:48,242;00:14:50,143;Nymeria, gloves.
176;00:14:56,250;00:14:58,251;Impressive.
176;00:14:56,250;00:14:58,251;Shut up.
177;00:14:58,286;00:15:00,887;Nymeria, gloves!
178;00:15:02,223;00:15:04,758;I have something for you.
179;00:15:04,792;00:15:07,127;And it has to be packed
179;00:15:04,792;00:15:07,127;very carefully.
180;00:15:07,161;00:15:08,962;A present?
181;00:15:08,996;00:15:11,098;Close the door.
182;00:15:23,478;00:15:25,946;This is no toy.
183;00:15:28,583;00:15:31,451;Be careful you don't
183;00:15:28,583;00:15:31,451;cut yourself.
184;00:15:34,188;00:15:36,356;It's so skinny.
184;00:15:34,188;00:15:36,356;So are you.
185;00:15:37,592;00:15:39,459;I had the blacksmith
185;00:15:37,592;00:15:39,459;make it for you special.
186;00:15:39,494;00:15:40,961;It won't hack
186;00:15:39,494;00:15:40,961;a man's head off,
187;00:15:40,995;00:15:43,130;but it can poke him full
187;00:15:40,995;00:15:43,130;of holes if you're quick enough.
188;00:15:43,164;00:15:44,201;I can be quick.
189;00:15:44,226;00:15:45,922;You'll have to work
189;00:15:44,226;00:15:45,922;at it every day.
190;00:15:47,101;00:15:48,535;How does it feel?
191;00:15:48,569;00:15:51,238;Do you like
191;00:15:48,569;00:15:51,238;the balance?
192;00:15:51,272;00:15:53,440;I think so.
193;00:15:54,809;00:15:57,277;First lesson: Stick them
193;00:15:54,809;00:15:57,277;with the pointy end.
194;00:15:57,311;00:15:59,346;I know which end to use.
195;00:16:04,819;00:16:06,887;I'm going to miss you.
196;00:16:08,456;00:16:09,890;Careful.
197;00:16:21,102;00:16:24,037;All the best swords
197;00:16:21,102;00:16:24,037;have names, you know.
198;00:16:26,774;00:16:29,409;Sansa can keep
198;00:16:26,774;00:16:29,409;her sewing needles.
199;00:16:30,878;00:16:33,013;I've got a needle
199;00:16:30,878;00:16:33,013;of my own.
200;00:16:47,728;00:16:49,830;I came to say
200;00:16:47,728;00:16:49,830;goodbye to Bran.
201;00:16:49,864;00:16:51,598;You've said it.
202;00:17:02,310;00:17:05,345;I wish I could be here
202;00:17:02,310;00:17:05,345;when you wake up.
203;00:17:08,316;00:17:10,851;I'm going north
203;00:17:08,316;00:17:10,851;with Uncle Benjen.
204;00:17:10,885;00:17:12,652;I'm taking the black.
205;00:17:21,562;00:17:24,297;I know we always talked about
205;00:17:21,562;00:17:24,297;seeing the wall together,
206;00:17:24,332;00:17:28,201;but you'll be able to come visit me
206;00:17:24,332;00:17:28,201;at Castle Black when you're better.
207;00:17:30,037;00:17:32,372;I'll know my way
207;00:17:30,037;00:17:32,372;around by then.
208;00:17:32,406;00:17:35,175;I'll be a sworn brother
208;00:17:32,406;00:17:35,175;of The Night's Watch.
209;00:17:40,248;00:17:43,283;We can go out walking beyond the wall,
209;00:17:40,248;00:17:43,283;if you're not afraid.
210;00:17:57,899;00:18:00,133;I want you
211;00:18:00,201;00:18:01,801;to leave.
212;00:19:02,129;00:19:04,297;17 years ago
213;00:19:04,332;00:19:06,499;you rode off
213;00:19:04,332;00:19:06,499;with Robert Baratheon.
214;00:19:08,703;00:19:12,038;You came back a year later with
214;00:19:08,703;00:19:12,038;another woman's son.
215;00:19:13,507;00:19:16,209;And now
215;00:19:13,507;00:19:16,209;you're leaving again.
216;00:19:18,879;00:19:20,647;I have no choice.
217;00:19:20,681;00:19:24,551;That's what men always say
217;00:19:20,681;00:19:24,551;when honor calls.
218;00:19:24,585;00:19:28,154;That's what you tell your families,
218;00:19:24,585;00:19:28,154;tell yourselves.
219;00:19:29,724;00:19:32,058;You do have a choice.
220;00:19:32,093;00:19:34,861;And you've made it.
221;00:19:37,999;00:19:40,033;Cat--
222;00:19:45,706;00:19:48,408;I can't do it, Ned.
223;00:19:51,379;00:19:54,581;I really can't.
223;00:19:51,379;00:19:54,581;You can.
224;00:19:56,884;00:19:58,685;You must.
225;00:20:22,109;00:20:24,644;You've said
225;00:20:22,109;00:20:24,644;goodbye to Bran?
226;00:20:24,678;00:20:27,113;He's not going to die.
226;00:20:24,678;00:20:27,113;I know it.
227;00:20:27,148;00:20:29,449;You Starks
227;00:20:27,148;00:20:29,449;are hard to kill.
228;00:20:30,351;00:20:32,052;My mother?
229;00:20:32,086;00:20:34,554;She was very kind.
229;00:20:32,086;00:20:34,554;Good.
230;00:20:36,290;00:20:38,558;Next time I see you,
230;00:20:36,290;00:20:38,558;you'll be all in black.
231;00:20:38,592;00:20:40,760;It was always my color.
232;00:20:41,962;00:20:45,098;Farewell, Snow.
232;00:20:41,962;00:20:45,098;And you, Stark.
233;00:21:37,551;00:21:40,086;There's great honor serving
233;00:21:37,551;00:21:40,086;in The Night's Watch.
234;00:21:42,123;00:21:45,558;The Starks have manned the wall
234;00:21:42,123;00:21:45,558;for thousands of years.
235;00:21:45,593;00:21:48,561;And you are a Stark.
236;00:21:48,596;00:21:50,830;You might not have my name,
237;00:21:50,898;00:21:52,999;but you have my blood.
238;00:21:59,340;00:22:01,741;Is my mother alive?
239;00:22:01,775;00:22:04,978;Does she know about me?
239;00:22:01,775;00:22:04,978;Where I am, where I'm going?
240;00:22:06,580;00:22:08,681;Does she care?
241;00:22:09,850;00:22:12,152;The next time
241;00:22:09,850;00:22:12,152;we see each other,
242;00:22:12,186;00:22:14,521;we'll talk
242;00:22:12,186;00:22:14,521;about your mother.
243;00:22:14,555;00:22:16,422;Huh?
244;00:22:16,457;00:22:18,525;I promise.
245;00:22:58,132;00:23:01,134;Gods, this is country!
246;00:23:02,903;00:23:06,472;I've half a mind to leave them
246;00:23:02,903;00:23:06,472;all behind and keep going.
247;00:23:08,609;00:23:10,910;I've half a mind
247;00:23:08,609;00:23:10,910;to go with you.
248;00:23:10,945;00:23:12,979;What do you say,
248;00:23:10,945;00:23:12,979;just you and me
249;00:23:13,013;00:23:15,548;on the Kingsroad,
249;00:23:13,013;00:23:15,548;swords at our sides,
250;00:23:15,583;00:23:19,152;a couple of tavern wenches
250;00:23:15,583;00:23:19,152;to warm our beds tonight.
251;00:23:19,186;00:23:21,854;You should have
251;00:23:19,186;00:23:21,854;asked me 20 years ago.
252;00:23:21,889;00:23:24,757;There were wars to fight,
252;00:23:21,889;00:23:24,757;women to marry--
253;00:23:24,792;00:23:26,859;we never had the chance
253;00:23:24,792;00:23:26,859;to be young.
254;00:23:26,894;00:23:28,895;I recall
254;00:23:26,894;00:23:28,895;a few chances.
255;00:23:32,766;00:23:35,435;There was that one...
255;00:23:32,766;00:23:35,435;Oh, what was her name?
256;00:23:35,469;00:23:37,437;That common girl of yours?
257;00:23:37,471;00:23:40,273;Becca? With the great big tits
257;00:23:37,471;00:23:40,273;you could bury your face in.
258;00:23:40,341;00:23:42,642;Bessie.
258;00:23:40,341;00:23:42,642;She was one of yours.
259;00:23:42,676;00:23:46,312;Bessie!
259;00:23:42,676;00:23:46,312;Thank the gods for Bessie
260;00:23:46,347;00:23:49,182;and her tits.
261;00:23:49,216;00:23:51,618;Yours was... Aleena?
262;00:23:51,652;00:23:54,721;No. You told me once.
262;00:23:51,652;00:23:54,721;Meryl?
263;00:23:54,755;00:23:56,789;Your bastard's mother?
264;00:23:58,425;00:24:00,693;Wylla.
264;00:23:58,425;00:24:00,693;That's it.
265;00:24:00,728;00:24:02,895;She must have been
265;00:24:00,728;00:24:02,895;a rare wench
266;00:24:02,930;00:24:05,765;to make Lord Eddard Stark
266;00:24:02,930;00:24:05,765;forget his honor.
267;00:24:05,799;00:24:08,034;You never told me
267;00:24:05,799;00:24:08,034;what she looked like.
268;00:24:08,068;00:24:10,436;Nor will I.
269;00:24:12,906;00:24:14,774;We were at war.
270;00:24:14,808;00:24:17,477;None of us knew if we were
270;00:24:14,808;00:24:17,477;gonna go back home again.
271;00:24:17,511;00:24:20,980;You're too hard on yourself.
271;00:24:17,511;00:24:20,980;You always have been.
272;00:24:22,883;00:24:26,085;I swear if I weren't your King,
272;00:24:22,883;00:24:26,085;you'd have hit me already.
273;00:24:26,120;00:24:29,155;The worst thing
273;00:24:26,120;00:24:29,155;about your coronation--
274;00:24:29,223;00:24:31,758;I'll never get
274;00:24:29,223;00:24:31,758;to hit you again.
275;00:24:33,927;00:24:36,496;Trust me, that's not
275;00:24:33,927;00:24:36,496;the worst thing.
276;00:24:40,467;00:24:42,502;There was a rider
276;00:24:40,467;00:24:42,502;in the night.
277;00:24:48,575;00:24:52,078;Daenerys Targaryen has wed
277;00:24:48,575;00:24:52,078;some Dothraki horselord.
278;00:24:52,112;00:24:54,781;What of it?
278;00:24:52,112;00:24:54,781;Should we send her a wedding gift?
279;00:24:54,815;00:24:56,516;A knife perhaps,
279;00:24:54,815;00:24:56,516;a good sharp one,
280;00:24:56,550;00:24:58,484;and a bold man to wield it.
281;00:24:58,552;00:25:00,486;She's little more
281;00:24:58,552;00:25:00,486;than a child.
282;00:25:00,521;00:25:03,756;Soon enough that child will spread
282;00:25:00,521;00:25:03,756;her legs and start breeding.
283;00:25:03,791;00:25:07,460;Tell me we're not speaking of this.
283;00:25:03,791;00:25:07,460;Oh, it's unspeakable to you?
284;00:25:07,494;00:25:11,364;What her father did to your family--
284;00:25:07,494;00:25:11,364;that was unspeakable.
285;00:25:11,398;00:25:13,466;What Rhaegar Targaryen
285;00:25:11,398;00:25:13,466;did to your sister--
286;00:25:13,500;00:25:15,635;the woman I loved.
287;00:25:15,669;00:25:18,938;I'll kill every Targaryen
287;00:25:15,669;00:25:18,938;I get my hands on.
288;00:25:18,972;00:25:21,174;But you can't get
288;00:25:18,972;00:25:21,174;your hands on this one, can you?
289;00:25:21,208;00:25:23,142;This Khal Drogo,
290;00:25:23,177;00:25:25,511;it's said he has 100,000 men
290;00:25:23,177;00:25:25,511;in his horde.
291;00:25:25,546;00:25:28,314;Even a million Dothraki
291;00:25:25,546;00:25:28,314;are no threat to the realm,
292;00:25:28,349;00:25:31,150;as long as they remain on the
292;00:25:28,349;00:25:31,150;other side of the Narrow Sea.
293;00:25:31,185;00:25:33,152;They have no ships,
293;00:25:31,185;00:25:33,152;Robert.
294;00:25:33,187;00:25:36,356;There are still those in the
294;00:25:33,187;00:25:36,356;Seven Kingdoms who call me usurper.
295;00:25:37,891;00:25:41,160;If the Targaryen boy crosses
295;00:25:37,891;00:25:41,160;with a Dothraki horde at his back,
296;00:25:41,195;00:25:43,996;the scum will join him.
296;00:25:41,195;00:25:43,996;He will not cross.
297;00:25:45,699;00:25:48,868;And if by chance he does,
297;00:25:45,699;00:25:48,868;we'll throw him back into the sea.
298;00:25:53,640;00:25:55,742;There's a war coming, Ned.
299;00:25:55,776;00:25:57,610;I don't know when,
300;00:25:57,644;00:26:00,179;I don't know who
300;00:25:57,644;00:26:00,179;we'll be fighting,
301;00:26:00,214;00:26:01,714;but it's coming.
302;00:27:13,454;00:27:15,354;Sit.
303;00:27:15,389;00:27:17,390;You'll be fed.
304;00:27:20,694;00:27:23,062;Untie them.
305;00:27:23,096;00:27:26,566;Ah, rapers.
306;00:27:28,602;00:27:32,405;They were given a choice no doubt--
306;00:27:28,602;00:27:32,405;castration or the wall.
307;00:27:32,473;00:27:34,874;Most choose the knife.
308;00:27:39,513;00:27:42,415;Not impressed
308;00:27:39,513;00:27:42,415;by your new brothers?
309;00:27:45,118;00:27:47,053;Lovely thing
309;00:27:45,118;00:27:47,053;about the watch--
310;00:27:47,087;00:27:50,590;you discard your old family
310;00:27:47,087;00:27:50,590;and get a whole new one.
311;00:27:59,266;00:28:01,434;Why do you read so much?
312;00:28:01,468;00:28:04,737;Look at me and tell me
312;00:28:01,468;00:28:04,737;what you see.
313;00:28:05,906;00:28:07,773;Is this a trick?
314;00:28:07,841;00:28:11,544;What you see is a dwarf.
315;00:28:11,578;00:28:15,014;If I'd been born a peasant they might've
315;00:28:11,578;00:28:15,014;left me out in the woods to die.
316;00:28:15,048;00:28:18,851;Alas, I was born a Lannister
316;00:28:15,048;00:28:18,851;of Casterly Rock.
317;00:28:18,886;00:28:21,420;Things are expected of me.
318;00:28:21,455;00:28:23,890;My father was the Hand
318;00:28:21,455;00:28:23,890;of the King for 20 years.
319;00:28:23,924;00:28:26,125;Until your brother
319;00:28:23,924;00:28:26,125;killed that King.
320;00:28:31,632;00:28:35,601;Yes, until my brother
320;00:28:31,632;00:28:35,601;killed him.
321;00:28:37,504;00:28:40,139;Life is full of these
321;00:28:37,504;00:28:40,139;little ironies.
322;00:28:41,341;00:28:43,309;My sister married
322;00:28:41,341;00:28:43,309;the new King
323;00:28:43,343;00:28:46,546;and my repulsive nephew
323;00:28:43,343;00:28:46,546;will be King after him.
324;00:28:49,149;00:28:52,451;I must do my part for the honor
324;00:28:49,149;00:28:52,451;of my house, wouldn't you agree?
325;00:28:54,154;00:28:56,088;But how?
326;00:28:56,123;00:28:58,925;Well, my brother
326;00:28:56,123;00:28:58,925;has his sword
327;00:28:58,959;00:29:00,826;and I have my mind.
328;00:29:00,894;00:29:04,196;And a mind needs books
328;00:29:00,894;00:29:04,196;like a sword needs a whetstone.
329;00:29:04,231;00:29:07,333;That's why I read
329;00:29:04,231;00:29:07,333;so much, Jon Snow.
330;00:29:10,671;00:29:13,139;And you?
331;00:29:13,173;00:29:15,508;What's your story,
331;00:29:13,173;00:29:15,508;bastard?
332;00:29:17,711;00:29:20,713;Ask me nicely and maybe
332;00:29:17,711;00:29:20,713;I'll tell you, dwarf.
333;00:29:24,484;00:29:27,453;A bastard boy
333;00:29:24,484;00:29:27,453;with nothing to inherit,
334;00:29:27,487;00:29:29,422;off to join
335;00:29:29,456;00:29:31,924;the ancient order
335;00:29:29,456;00:29:31,924;of The Night's Watch,
336;00:29:31,959;00:29:35,928;alongside his Valiant
336;00:29:31,959;00:29:35,928;brothers-in-arms.
337;00:29:35,963;00:29:38,030;The Night's Watch protects
337;00:29:35,963;00:29:38,030;the realm from--
338;00:29:38,065;00:29:41,300;ah, yes yes, against grumpkins
338;00:29:38,065;00:29:41,300;and snarks
339;00:29:41,335;00:29:44,770;and all the other monsters
339;00:29:41,335;00:29:44,770;your wet nurse warned you about.
340;00:29:44,805;00:29:47,173;You're a smart boy.
341;00:29:47,207;00:29:49,809;You don't believe
341;00:29:47,207;00:29:49,809;that nonsense.
342;00:29:57,150;00:30:00,286;Everything's better
342;00:29:57,150;00:30:00,286;with some wine in the belly.
343;00:30:34,688;00:30:38,557;It's time we reviewed
343;00:30:34,688;00:30:38,557;the accounts, my lady.
344;00:30:38,625;00:30:42,728;You'll want to know how much
344;00:30:38,625;00:30:42,728;this royal visit has cost us.
345;00:30:44,297;00:30:46,899;Talk to Poole about it.
346;00:30:48,235;00:30:51,337;Poole went south
346;00:30:48,235;00:30:51,337;with Lord Stark, my lady.
347;00:30:51,371;00:30:54,073;We need a new steward,
348;00:30:54,107;00:30:57,276;and there are several other
348;00:30:54,107;00:30:57,276;appointments that require
349;00:30:57,310;00:31:01,414;our immediate attention--
349;00:30:57,310;00:31:01,414;I don't care about appointments!
350;00:31:02,716;00:31:04,583;I'll make the appointments.
351;00:31:07,320;00:31:09,235;We'll talk about it
351;00:31:07,320;00:31:09,235;first thing in the morning.
352;00:31:09,260;00:31:11,460;Very good, my Lord.
353;00:31:13,694;00:31:15,327;My Lady.
354;00:31:28,208;00:31:30,409;When was the last time
354;00:31:28,208;00:31:30,409;you left this room?
355;00:31:30,444;00:31:33,079;I have to take care
355;00:31:30,444;00:31:33,079;of him.
356;00:31:33,113;00:31:34,980;He's not going
356;00:31:33,113;00:31:34,980;to die, mother.
357;00:31:34,981;00:31:37,192;Maester Luwin says the most
357;00:31:34,981;00:31:37,192;dangerous time has passed.
358;00:31:37,193;00:31:38,559;What if he's wrong?
359;00:31:38,655;00:31:42,359;Bran needs me.
359;00:31:38,655;00:31:42,359;Rickon needs you.
360;00:31:42,422;00:31:44,356;He's six.
361;00:31:44,391;00:31:47,793;He doesn't know what's happening.
361;00:31:44,391;00:31:47,793;He follows me around all day,
362;00:31:47,828;00:31:50,262;clutching my leg, crying--
362;00:31:47,828;00:31:50,262;close the windows!
363;00:31:50,297;00:31:52,465;I can't stand it!
363;00:31:50,297;00:31:52,465;Please make them stop!
364;00:31:56,169;00:31:58,671;Fire.
365;00:31:58,705;00:32:00,873;You stay here.
365;00:31:58,705;00:32:00,873;I'll come back.
366;00:32:18,592;00:32:21,093;You're not supposed
366;00:32:18,592;00:32:21,093;to be here.
367;00:32:21,128;00:32:23,829;No one is
367;00:32:21,128;00:32:23,829;supposed to be here.
368;00:32:23,897;00:32:27,466;It's a mercy.
368;00:32:23,897;00:32:27,466;He's dead already.
369;00:32:30,137;00:32:32,838;No!
370;00:33:38,572;00:33:42,341;Have you ever seen a dragon?
370;00:33:38,572;00:33:42,341;Dragon gone, Khaleesi.
371;00:33:42,375;00:33:45,411;Everywhere?
371;00:33:42,375;00:33:45,411;Even in the east?
372;00:33:45,445;00:33:48,380;No dragon.
372;00:33:45,445;00:33:48,380;Brave men kill them.
373;00:33:48,415;00:33:51,617;It is known.
373;00:33:48,415;00:33:51,617;It is known.
374;00:33:51,651;00:33:55,688;A trader from Garth told me
374;00:33:51,651;00:33:55,688;that dragons come from the moon.
375;00:33:55,722;00:33:58,057;The moon?
376;00:33:58,124;00:34:00,292;He told me the moon
376;00:33:58,124;00:34:00,292;was an egg, Khaleesi,
377;00:34:00,327;00:34:03,362;that once there were
377;00:34:00,327;00:34:03,362;two moons in the sky.
378;00:34:03,396;00:34:07,233;But one wandered too close
378;00:34:03,396;00:34:07,233;to the sun and it cracked from the heat.
379;00:34:07,267;00:34:10,502;Out of it poured a thousand
379;00:34:07,267;00:34:10,502;thousand dragons
380;00:34:10,537;00:34:12,471;and they drank
380;00:34:10,537;00:34:12,471;the sun's fire.
381;00:34:12,505;00:34:15,407;Moon is no egg.
382;00:34:15,442;00:34:18,277;Moon is goddess--
382;00:34:15,442;00:34:18,277;wife of sun.
383;00:34:18,311;00:34:21,080;It is known.
383;00:34:18,311;00:34:21,080;It is known.
384;00:34:22,616;00:34:24,583;Leave me with her.
385;00:34:32,425;00:34:35,694;Why did the trader from Garth
385;00:34:32,425;00:34:35,694;tell you these stories?
386;00:34:35,729;00:34:38,931;Men like to talk
386;00:34:35,729;00:34:38,931;when they're happy.
387;00:34:38,965;00:34:41,000;Before your brother
387;00:34:38,965;00:34:41,000;bought me for you,
388;00:34:41,034;00:34:43,102;it was my job
388;00:34:41,034;00:34:43,102;to make men happy.
389;00:34:43,169;00:34:46,338;How old were you?
389;00:34:43,169;00:34:46,338;I was nine
390;00:34:46,373;00:34:48,374;when my mother sold me
390;00:34:46,373;00:34:48,374;to the pleasure house.
391;00:34:48,408;00:34:49,909;Nine?!
392;00:34:49,943;00:34:53,379;I did not touch a man
392;00:34:49,943;00:34:53,379;for three years, Khaleesi.
393;00:34:53,413;00:34:54,947;First
394;00:34:54,981;00:34:56,949;you must learn.
395;00:34:59,786;00:35:03,289;Can you teach me how
395;00:34:59,786;00:35:03,289;to make the Khal happy?
396;00:35:04,491;00:35:08,394;Yes.
396;00:35:04,491;00:35:08,394;Will it take three years?
397;00:35:09,796;00:35:11,463;No.
398;00:35:32,919;00:35:35,120;Welcome.
399;00:37:05,512;00:37:09,081;What I am about to tell
399;00:37:05,512;00:37:09,081;you must remain between us.
400;00:37:10,583;00:37:13,218;I don't think Bran
400;00:37:10,583;00:37:13,218;fell from that tower.
401;00:37:14,421;00:37:16,422;I think he was thrown.
402;00:37:17,757;00:37:20,526;The boy was always
402;00:37:17,757;00:37:20,526;sure-footed before.
403;00:37:20,560;00:37:23,295;Someone tried
403;00:37:20,560;00:37:23,295;to kill him twice.
404;00:37:23,329;00:37:26,432;Why?
404;00:37:23,329;00:37:26,432;Why murder an innocent child?
405;00:37:26,466;00:37:29,201;Unless he saw something
405;00:37:26,466;00:37:29,201;he wasn't meant to see.
406;00:37:29,235;00:37:31,937;Saw what, my lady?
406;00:37:29,235;00:37:31,937;I don't know.
407;00:37:33,506;00:37:35,741;But I would stake my life
407;00:37:33,506;00:37:35,741;the Lannisters are involved.
408;00:37:35,775;00:37:39,211;We already have reason
408;00:37:35,775;00:37:39,211;to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
409;00:37:39,245;00:37:41,547;Did you notice the dagger
409;00:37:39,245;00:37:41,547;the killer used?
410;00:37:41,581;00:37:44,016;It's too fine a weapon
410;00:37:41,581;00:37:44,016;for such a man.
411;00:37:44,050;00:37:47,352;The blade is Valyrian steel,
411;00:37:44,050;00:37:47,352;the handle dragonbone.
412;00:37:47,387;00:37:49,288;Someone gave it to him.
413;00:37:50,690;00:37:54,226;They come into our home
413;00:37:50,690;00:37:54,226;and try to murder my brother?
414;00:37:54,260;00:37:56,481;If it's war they want--
415;00:37:56,506;00:37:58,194;If it comes to that, you know
415;00:37:56,506;00:37:58,194;I'll stand behind you.
416;00:37:58,198;00:38:01,066;What, is there going to be
416;00:37:58,198;00:38:01,066;a battle in the Godswood?
417;00:38:01,101;00:38:03,068;Huh?
418;00:38:03,103;00:38:06,071;Too easily words of war
418;00:38:03,103;00:38:06,071;become acts of war.
419;00:38:06,106;00:38:08,140;We don't know
419;00:38:06,106;00:38:08,140;the truth yet.
420;00:38:08,208;00:38:10,742;Lord Stark
420;00:38:08,208;00:38:10,742;must be told of this.
421;00:38:10,777;00:38:13,712;I don't trust a raven
421;00:38:10,777;00:38:13,712;to carry these words.
422;00:38:13,746;00:38:15,647;I'll ride to King's Landing.
422;00:38:13,746;00:38:15,647;No.
423;00:38:15,682;00:38:18,984;There must always be
423;00:38:15,682;00:38:18,984;a Stark in Winterfell.
424;00:38:19,018;00:38:21,320;I will go myself.
424;00:38:19,018;00:38:21,320;Mother, you can't.
425;00:38:21,387;00:38:23,522;I must.
426;00:38:23,556;00:38:26,258;I'll send hal with a squad
426;00:38:23,556;00:38:26,258;of guardsmen to escort you.
427;00:38:26,292;00:38:28,794;Too large a party attracts
427;00:38:26,292;00:38:28,794;unwanted attention.
428;00:38:28,828;00:38:31,130;I don't want the Lannisters
428;00:38:28,828;00:38:31,130;to know I'm coming.
429;00:38:31,164;00:38:32,998;Let me accompany you
429;00:38:31,164;00:38:32,998;at least.
430;00:38:33,032;00:38:35,934;The Kingsroad can be a
430;00:38:33,032;00:38:35,934;dangerous place for a woman alone.
431;00:38:39,672;00:38:42,007;What about Bran?
432;00:38:43,543;00:38:46,645;I have prayed to the seven
432;00:38:43,543;00:38:46,645;for more than a month.
433;00:38:47,814;00:38:51,183;Bran's life is
433;00:38:47,814;00:38:51,183;in their hands now.
434;00:39:49,876;00:39:52,144;No, Khaleesi.
435;00:39:52,178;00:39:54,980;You must look
435;00:39:52,178;00:39:54,980;in his eyes always.
436;00:39:55,014;00:39:57,049;Love comes in at the eyes.
437;00:39:57,083;00:40:01,520;It is said that Irogenia of Lys
437;00:39:57,083;00:40:01,520;could finish a man
438;00:40:01,554;00:40:03,589;with nothing
438;00:40:01,554;00:40:03,589;but her eyes.
439;00:40:03,623;00:40:05,924;Finish a man?
440;00:40:07,427;00:40:09,528;Oh.
441;00:40:09,562;00:40:14,099;Kings traveled across
441;00:40:09,562;00:40:14,099;the world for a night with Irogenia.
442;00:40:14,133;00:40:16,768;Magisters sold
442;00:40:14,133;00:40:16,768;their palaces.
443;00:40:16,803;00:40:20,539;Khals burned her enemies
443;00:40:16,803;00:40:20,539;just to have her for a few hours.
444;00:40:20,573;00:40:24,343;They say a thousand men
444;00:40:20,573;00:40:24,343;proposed to her
445;00:40:24,377;00:40:27,212;and she refused them all.
446;00:40:27,247;00:40:30,816;Well, she sounds like
446;00:40:27,247;00:40:30,816;an interesting woman.
447;00:40:30,850;00:40:32,784;I-- I don't think
448;00:40:32,819;00:40:35,087;that Drogo will like it
448;00:40:32,819;00:40:35,087;with me on top.
449;00:40:35,121;00:40:37,623;You will make him
449;00:40:35,121;00:40:37,623;like it, Khaleesi.
450;00:40:37,657;00:40:39,891;Men want what
450;00:40:37,657;00:40:39,891;they've never had.
451;00:40:39,926;00:40:43,128;And the Dothraki take slaves
451;00:40:39,926;00:40:43,128;like a hound takes a bitch.
452;00:40:43,162;00:40:46,632;Are you a slave,
452;00:40:43,162;00:40:46,632;Khaleesi?
453;00:40:57,243;00:41:00,112;Then don't make love
453;00:40:57,243;00:41:00,112;like a slave.
454;00:41:08,488;00:41:10,856;Very good, Khaleesi.
455;00:41:10,890;00:41:13,058;Out there
455;00:41:10,890;00:41:13,058;he is the mighty Khal,
456;00:41:13,092;00:41:17,162;but in this tent,
456;00:41:13,092;00:41:17,162;he belongs to you.
457;00:41:17,196;00:41:19,431;I-- I don't think
458;00:41:19,465;00:41:21,533;that this is
458;00:41:19,465;00:41:21,533;the Dothraki way.
459;00:41:21,567;00:41:24,136;If he wanted
459;00:41:21,567;00:41:24,136;the Dothraki way,
460;00:41:24,170;00:41:27,172;why did he marry you?
461;00:42:15,621;00:42:18,490;No.
462;00:42:20,893;00:42:22,794;No!
463;00:42:22,829;00:42:27,499;Ajjalan anha zalat
463;00:42:22,829;00:42:27,499;vitiherat yer hatif.
464;00:44:13,940;00:44:15,774;Pardon me, Ser.
465;00:44:19,612;00:44:21,947;Do I frighten you
465;00:44:19,612;00:44:21,947;so much, girl?
466;00:44:23,649;00:44:26,418;Or is it him there
466;00:44:23,649;00:44:26,418;making you shake?
467;00:44:26,452;00:44:29,054;He frightens
467;00:44:26,452;00:44:29,054;me too.
468;00:44:29,088;00:44:31,556;Look at
468;00:44:29,088;00:44:31,556;that face.
469;00:44:31,591;00:44:34,359;I'm sorry
469;00:44:31,591;00:44:34,359;if I offended you, Ser.
470;00:44:40,967;00:44:42,935;Why won't he speak to me?
471;00:44:42,936;00:44:45,136;He hasn't been very talkative
471;00:44:42,936;00:44:45,136;these last 20 years.
472;00:44:45,137;00:44:48,206;Since the mad King had his tongue
472;00:44:45,137;00:44:48,206;ripped out with hot pincers.
473;00:44:48,241;00:44:50,976;He speaks damn well
473;00:44:48,241;00:44:50,976;with his sword though.
474;00:44:51,010;00:44:54,779;Ser Ilyn Payne,
474;00:44:51,010;00:44:54,779;the King's justice.
475;00:44:56,282;00:44:58,416;The royal
475;00:44:56,282;00:44:58,416;executioner.
476;00:44:59,719;00:45:02,888;What is it, sweet lady?
477;00:45:04,457;00:45:06,525;Does the hound frighten you?
478;00:45:06,559;00:45:08,260;Away with you, dog.
479;00:45:08,294;00:45:10,962;You're scaring
479;00:45:08,294;00:45:10,962;my lady.
480;00:45:13,165;00:45:15,300;I don't like
480;00:45:13,165;00:45:15,300;to see you upset.
481;00:45:17,803;00:45:19,604;The Sun is finally shining.
482;00:45:19,639;00:45:21,406;Come walk with me.
483;00:45:23,342;00:45:25,477;Stay, lady.
484;00:45:42,128;00:45:44,329;I probably shouldn't
484;00:45:42,128;00:45:44,329;have any more.
485;00:45:44,363;00:45:46,731;Father only lets us
485;00:45:44,363;00:45:46,731;have one cup at feasts.
486;00:45:46,766;00:45:49,834;My princess can drink
486;00:45:46,766;00:45:49,834;as much as she wants.
487;00:46:02,248;00:46:05,016;Don't worry--
487;00:46:02,248;00:46:05,016;you're safe with me.
488;00:46:06,018;00:46:08,119;I'll get you!
489;00:46:13,292;00:46:16,227;Arya!
489;00:46:13,292;00:46:16,227;Ow!
490;00:46:16,262;00:46:17,829;What are you doing here?
491;00:46:17,863;00:46:20,332;Go away.
491;00:46:17,863;00:46:20,332;Your sister?
492;00:46:24,070;00:46:26,871;And who are you, boy?
492;00:46:24,070;00:46:26,871;Mycah, my Lord.
493;00:46:26,906;00:46:29,007;He the butcher's boy.
493;00:46:26,906;00:46:29,007;He's my friend.
494;00:46:29,041;00:46:32,510;A butcher's boy who wants
494;00:46:29,041;00:46:32,510;to be a Knight, eh?
495;00:46:34,113;00:46:36,948;Pick up your sword, butcher's boy.
495;00:46:34,113;00:46:36,948;Let's see how good you are.
496;00:46:36,983;00:46:39,584;She asked me to, my Lord.
496;00:46:36,983;00:46:39,584;She asked me to.
497;00:46:39,619;00:46:41,586;I'm your prince,
498;00:46:41,621;00:46:43,555;not your lord,
499;00:46:43,589;00:46:47,192;and I said pick up
499;00:46:43,589;00:46:47,192;your sword.
500;00:46:47,259;00:46:49,594;It's not a sword, my prince.
500;00:46:47,259;00:46:49,594;It's only a stick.
501;00:46:49,629;00:46:51,496;And you're not a Knight.
502;00:46:52,832;00:46:55,066;Only a butcher's boy.
503;00:46:55,101;00:46:58,136;That was my lady's sister
503;00:46:55,101;00:46:58,136;you were hitting, do you know that?
504;00:46:58,170;00:47:00,505;Stop it!
504;00:46:58,170;00:47:00,505;Arya, stay out of this.
505;00:47:01,440;00:47:03,208;I won't hurt him...
506;00:47:03,242;00:47:04,843;Much.
507;00:47:13,352;00:47:14,619;Arya!
508;00:47:15,621;00:47:17,022;Filthy little bitch!
509;00:47:17,056;00:47:18,957;No no, stop it, stop it,
509;00:47:17,056;00:47:18,957;both of you.
510;00:47:18,991;00:47:22,327;You're spoiling it.
510;00:47:18,991;00:47:22,327;You're spoiling everything!
511;00:47:22,361;00:47:24,996;I'll gut you,
511;00:47:22,361;00:47:24,996;you little cunt!
512;00:47:27,700;00:47:29,801;Arya!
512;00:47:27,700;00:47:29,801;Nymeria!
513;00:47:29,835;00:47:32,404;Arya!
513;00:47:29,835;00:47:32,404;Nymeria!
514;00:47:37,276;00:47:39,210;No.
515;00:47:39,245;00:47:41,846;No.
515;00:47:39,245;00:47:41,846;Please don't.
516;00:47:41,881;00:47:44,315;Arya, leave him alone.
517;00:48:02,902;00:48:06,371;My prince, my poor prince,
517;00:48:02,902;00:48:06,371;look what they did to you.
518;00:48:06,405;00:48:08,840;Stay here, I'll go back
518;00:48:06,405;00:48:08,840;to the inn and bring help.
519;00:48:08,874;00:48:10,208;Then go!
520;00:48:12,011;00:48:14,446;Don't touch me.
521;00:48:16,449;00:48:19,417;The wolf's not here.
521;00:48:16,449;00:48:19,417;Look down by the stream.
522;00:48:25,424;00:48:29,394;You've got to go. They'll kill you for
522;00:48:25,424;00:48:29,394;what you did to Joffrey.
523;00:48:29,428;00:48:31,563;Go on-- run.
524;00:48:34,667;00:48:36,835;Go!
524;00:48:34,667;00:48:36,835;Leave now!
525;00:48:38,938;00:48:41,406;It's a direwolf.
525;00:48:38,938;00:48:41,406;I'll check down here.
526;00:48:46,979;00:48:50,582;I think I heard a noise.
527;00:48:52,151;00:48:53,785;Go!
528;00:49:05,765;00:49:08,900;Arya!
529;00:49:08,934;00:49:13,638;Distant man: Arya!
529;00:49:08,934;00:49:13,638;Ned: Arya!
530;00:49:13,672;00:49:16,574;Arya-aa!
531;00:49:17,710;00:49:19,778;Arya!
532;00:49:19,812;00:49:21,546;Arya!
533;00:49:21,580;00:49:23,515;My lord!
534;00:49:23,549;00:49:25,950;My lord!
534;00:49:23,549;00:49:25,950;They found her.
535;00:49:25,985;00:49:28,453;She's unharmed.
536;00:49:28,487;00:49:30,005;Where is she?
537;00:49:30,030;00:49:31,756;She's been taken
537;00:49:30,030;00:49:31,756;directly before the King.
538;00:49:31,811;00:49:33,645;Who took her?
538;00:49:31,811;00:49:33,645;The Lannisters found her.
539;00:49:33,921;00:49:36,089;Arya-aa!
539;00:49:33,921;00:49:36,089;Right, get back.
540;00:49:36,159;00:49:38,539;The Queen ordered
540;00:49:36,159;00:49:38,539;them to bring her straight to him.
541;00:49:38,760;00:49:40,995;Back!
541;00:49:38,760;00:49:40,995;Back to the inn.
542;00:49:41,200;00:49:43,067;All back!
543;00:49:50,709;00:49:52,577;I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
543;00:49:50,709;00:49:52,577;I'm sorry.
544;00:49:52,611;00:49:54,345;- Are you hurt?
544;00:49:52,611;00:49:54,345;- No.
545;00:49:54,380;00:49:56,915;Oh, it's all right.
546;00:49:58,617;00:50:01,352;What is
546;00:49:58,617;00:50:01,352;the meaning of this?
547;00:50:01,420;00:50:04,139;Why was my daughter
547;00:50:01,420;00:50:04,139;not brought to me at once?
548;00:50:04,513;00:50:06,153;How dare you speak
548;00:50:04,513;00:50:06,153;to your King in that manner?
549;00:50:06,178;00:50:07,378;Quiet, woman.
550;00:50:08,327;00:50:11,229;Sorry, Ned.
550;00:50:08,327;00:50:11,229;I never meant to frighten the girl.
551;00:50:11,263;00:50:13,531;But we need to get
551;00:50:11,263;00:50:13,531;this business done quickly.
552;00:50:13,599;00:50:17,168;Your girl and that butcher's boy
552;00:50:13,599;00:50:17,168;attacked my son.
553;00:50:17,203;00:50:19,838;That animal of hers
553;00:50:17,203;00:50:19,838;nearly tore his arm off.
554;00:50:19,872;00:50:21,806;That's not true!
555;00:50:21,841;00:50:24,309;She just...
555;00:50:21,841;00:50:24,309;Bit him a little.
556;00:50:24,343;00:50:27,946;He was hurting Mycah.
556;00:50:24,343;00:50:27,946;Joff told us what happened.
557;00:50:27,980;00:50:29,881;You and that boy
557;00:50:27,980;00:50:29,881;beat him with clubs
558;00:50:29,915;00:50:32,784;while you set your wolf on him.
558;00:50:29,915;00:50:32,784;That's not what happened!
559;00:50:32,818;00:50:34,444;Yes it is!
560;00:50:34,469;00:50:36,219;They all attacked me and she
560;00:50:34,469;00:50:36,219;threw my sword in the river.
561;00:50:36,222;00:50:37,488;Liar!
561;00:50:36,222;00:50:37,488;Shut up!
562;00:50:37,523;00:50:38,923;Enough!
563;00:50:38,958;00:50:41,993;He tells me one thing,
563;00:50:38,958;00:50:41,993;she tells me another.
564;00:50:42,027;00:50:44,395;Seven hells!
564;00:50:42,027;00:50:44,395;What am I to make of this?
565;00:50:46,465;00:50:48,523;Where's your
565;00:50:46,465;00:50:48,523;other daughter, Ned?
566;00:50:48,548;00:50:49,900;In bed asleep.
567;00:50:50,363;00:50:51,664;She's not.
568;00:50:52,556;00:50:54,891;Sansa, come here, darling.
569;00:51:04,850;00:51:06,851;Now, child...
570;00:51:07,753;00:51:09,821;Tell me what happened.
571;00:51:09,855;00:51:11,923;Tell it all
571;00:51:09,855;00:51:11,923;and tell it true.
572;00:51:11,957;00:51:14,592;It's a great crime
572;00:51:11,957;00:51:14,592;to lie to a King.
573;00:51:23,002;00:51:24,936;I don't know.
574;00:51:24,970;00:51:28,406;I don't remember.
574;00:51:24,970;00:51:28,406;Everything happened so fast.
575;00:51:29,308;00:51:31,776;I didn't see.
575;00:51:29,308;00:51:31,776;Liar!
576;00:51:31,810;00:51:33,278;Liar liar liar!
576;00:51:31,810;00:51:33,278;Arya!
577;00:51:33,312;00:51:35,613;Hey, stop it! That's enough of that.
577;00:51:33,312;00:51:35,613;Liar liar liar!
578;00:51:35,648;00:51:40,009;Stop! Arya!
578;00:51:35,648;00:51:40,009;She's as wild as that animal of hers.
579;00:51:40,086;00:51:41,107;I want her punished.
580;00:51:41,108;00:51:43,840;What would you have me do,
580;00:51:41,108;00:51:43,840;whip her through the streets?
581;00:51:44,362;00:51:47,064;Damn it, children fight.
581;00:51:44,362;00:51:47,064;It's over.
582;00:51:47,100;00:51:49,702;Joffrey will bear these scars
582;00:51:47,100;00:51:49,702;for the rest of his life.
583;00:51:51,371;00:51:55,007;You let that
583;00:51:51,371;00:51:55,007;little girl disarm you?
584;00:52:01,014;00:52:04,150;Ned, see to it that
584;00:52:01,014;00:52:04,150;your daughter is disciplined.
585;00:52:04,184;00:52:07,053;I'll do the same with my son.
585;00:52:04,184;00:52:07,053;Gladly, your Grace.
586;00:52:08,288;00:52:10,923;And what of the direwolf?
587;00:52:10,958;00:52:13,559;What of the beast
587;00:52:10,958;00:52:13,559;that savaged your son?
588;00:52:16,430;00:52:18,931;I'd forgot
588;00:52:16,430;00:52:18,931;the damned wolf.
589;00:52:18,966;00:52:21,734;We found no trace
589;00:52:18,966;00:52:21,734;of the direwolf, your Grace.
590;00:52:21,768;00:52:25,037;No?
590;00:52:21,768;00:52:25,037;So be it.
591;00:52:25,072;00:52:27,240;We have another wolf.
592;00:52:30,544;00:52:32,178;As you will.
593;00:52:32,212;00:52:35,414;You can't mean it.
593;00:52:32,212;00:52:35,414;A direwolf's no pet.
594;00:52:35,449;00:52:37,884;Get her a dog.
594;00:52:35,449;00:52:37,884;She'll be happier for it.
595;00:52:39,019;00:52:41,387;He doesn't mean Lady,
595;00:52:39,019;00:52:41,387;does he?
596;00:52:41,421;00:52:44,423;No no, not lady!
596;00:52:41,421;00:52:44,423;Lady didn't bite anyone!
597;00:52:44,458;00:52:46,359;She's good!
597;00:52:44,458;00:52:46,359;Lady wasn't there!
598;00:52:46,393;00:52:49,762;You leave her alone!
598;00:52:46,393;00:52:49,762;Stop them. Don't let them do it.
599;00:52:49,830;00:52:52,565;Please please,
599;00:52:49,830;00:52:52,565;it wasn't Lady!
600;00:52:52,599;00:52:54,100;Is this your command--
601;00:52:55,168;00:52:56,702;your Grace?
602;00:53:03,110;00:53:06,646;Where is the beast?
602;00:53:03,110;00:53:06,646;Chained up outside, your Grace.
603;00:53:06,680;00:53:08,848;Ser Ilyn,
603;00:53:06,680;00:53:08,848;do me the honor.
604;00:53:08,882;00:53:11,183;No.
605;00:53:11,218;00:53:13,586;Jory...
606;00:53:14,688;00:53:16,722;Take the girls
606;00:53:14,688;00:53:16,722;to their rooms.

608;00:53:23,563;00:53:25,531;then I'll do it myself.
609;00:53:25,565;00:53:27,767;Is this some trick?
610;00:53:27,801;00:53:30,736;The wolf is of the north.
611;00:53:30,771;00:53:33,873;She deserves better
611;00:53:30,771;00:53:33,873;than a butcher.
612;00:54:07,240;00:54:09,175;The butcher's boy--
613;00:54:09,242;00:54:10,910;you rode him down?
