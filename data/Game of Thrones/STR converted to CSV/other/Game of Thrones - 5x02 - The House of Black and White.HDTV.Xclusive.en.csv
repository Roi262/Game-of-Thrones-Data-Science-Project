2;00:02:08,269;00:02:11,724;In old times, whenever
2;00:02:08,269;00:02:11,724;Braavos stood in danger,
3;00:02:11,844;00:02:15,516;the Titan would step with fire in its eyes,
4;00:02:15,636;00:02:19,531;wade into the sea and smash the enemies.
5;00:02:20,391;00:02:22,877;It's just a statue.
6;00:02:25,777;00:02:31,502;Haha. Don't be afraid. He's
6;00:02:25,777;00:02:31,502;announcing our arrival.
7;00:02:32,543;00:02:36,260;I'm not afraid.
8;00:03:42,861;00:03:45,775;The House of Black and White.
9;00:03:45,895;00:03:49,404;This is where you'll find
9;00:03:45,895;00:03:49,404;the man you seek.
10;00:03:53,568;00:03:57,018;Here, I leave you.
11;00:04:03,981;00:04:08,141;Thank you for bringing me.
11;00:04:03,981;00:04:08,141;Any man in Braavos would have done the same.
12;00:04:09,925;00:04:13,732;Valar morghulis.
12;00:04:09,925;00:04:13,732;Valar dohaeris.
13;00:04:49,053;00:04:51,021;Hello.
14;00:04:53,698;00:04:56,494;Valar morghulis.
15;00:05:06,334;00:05:08,925;Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.
16;00:05:12,399;00:05:16,595;No one here by that name.
16;00:05:12,399;00:05:16,595;Please!
17;00:05:16,715;00:05:20,105;I've crossed the narrow sea.
17;00:05:16,715;00:05:20,105;I have nowhere else to go.
18;00:05:20,225;00:05:24,863;You have everywhere else to go.
18;00:05:20,225;00:05:24,863;But wait!
19;00:05:44,017;00:05:48,143;Cersei...Walder Frey...
20;00:05:48,263;00:05:53,497;The Mountain...Meryn Trant.
21;00:05:54,612;00:06:00,114;Cersei...Walder Frey...
22;00:06:00,858;00:06:05,393;The Mountain...Meryn Trant.
23;00:06:05,513;00:06:06,905;Cersei...
24;00:06:07,197;00:06:08,581;Walder Frey...
25;00:06:08,701;00:06:10,277;The Mountain...
26;00:06:11,097;00:06:12,469;Meryn Trant.
27;00:06:14,418;00:06:15,759;Cersei...
28;00:06:15,879;00:06:17,197;Walder Frey...
29;00:06:17,733;00:06:18,881;The Mountain...
30;00:06:19,405;00:06:20,702;Meryn Trant.
31;00:06:21,923;00:06:23,008;Cersei...
32;00:06:24,418;00:06:25,790;Walder Frey...
33;00:06:27,222;00:06:29,347;The Mountain...
34;00:06:30,263;00:06:32,660;Meryn Trant...
35;00:07:03,264;00:07:05,320;Must be good food if it's crowded.
36;00:07:09,546;00:07:12,134;Ale?
37;00:07:18,533;00:07:20,475;Ale?
38;00:07:28,273;00:07:31,414;Before we left, a maester
38;00:07:28,273;00:07:31,414;gave you a raven's scroll.
39;00:07:33,936;00:07:36,648;You are becoming an observant young lady.
40;00:07:36,768;00:07:39,431;My mother used to say dark wings dark words.
41;00:07:39,551;00:07:43,310;An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.
42;00:07:45,690;00:07:47,688;So it's good news.
43;00:07:47,808;00:07:50,163;My marriage proposal has been accepted.
44;00:07:50,283;00:07:52,970;I thought you still mourned the
44;00:07:50,283;00:07:52,970;death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.
45;00:07:53,090;00:07:56,111;Ale?
45;00:07:53,090;00:07:56,111;I'll have some.
46;00:07:59,536;00:08:02,239;My Lady...
47;00:08:02,359;00:08:05,513;What is it?
47;00:08:02,359;00:08:05,513;Sansa Stark. Don't look!
48;00:08:06,992;00:08:07,899;You sure?
49;00:08:08,019;00:08:09,475;She's dyed her hair, but it's her.
50;00:08:09,595;00:08:11,202;She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.
51;00:08:11,322;00:08:12,240;Littlefinger?
52;00:08:12,360;00:08:13,852;A bunch of knights with them.
53;00:08:13,972;00:08:16,085;Bunch? Bunch...Six? Twenty?
54;00:08:16,205;00:08:17,594;Ten, I think. Too many.
55;00:08:18,321;00:08:19,642;My Lady, I don't think this is...
56;00:08:19,726;00:08:21,015;Ready the horses!
57;00:08:21,135;00:08:22,653;We only have one horse.
58;00:08:22,877;00:08:24,087;Find more!
59;00:08:30,314;00:08:31,561;Do you like the taste?
60;00:08:32,347;00:08:34,280;Don't see what all the fuss is about.
61;00:08:35,004;00:08:37,337;Why do men love it so much?
62;00:08:37,457;00:08:39,407;It gives some men courage.
63;00:08:39,805;00:08:41,377;Does it give you courage?
64;00:08:44,146;00:08:45,381;That's far enough.
65;00:08:47,315;00:08:48,712;Lord Baelish.
66;00:08:49,211;00:08:50,471;Lady Sansa.
67;00:08:50,850;00:08:52,708;My name is Brienne of Tarth.
68;00:08:52,828;00:08:55,228;We've met, with Renly Baratheon.
69;00:08:56,126;00:08:57,536;What did he say about you?
70;00:08:58,184;00:08:59,257;He said,
71;00:09:00,455;00:09:03,187;Your loyalty came free of charge.
72;00:09:04,397;00:09:07,291;Someone appears to have paid
72;00:09:04,397;00:09:07,291;quite a bit for it since then.
73;00:09:20,842;00:09:22,277;Lady Sansa.
74;00:09:23,699;00:09:25,109;Before your mother's death,
75;00:09:25,470;00:09:27,304;I was her sworn sword.
76;00:09:28,040;00:09:30,934;I gave my word I will
76;00:09:28,040;00:09:30,934;find you and protect you.
77;00:09:31,258;00:09:32,618;I will shield your back
78;00:09:32,738;00:09:33,934;and keep your counsel,
79;00:09:34,233;00:09:36,641;and give my life for you if needs be.
80;00:09:37,146;00:09:39,890;I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.
81;00:09:41,269;00:09:43,128;Please, lady Brienne.
82;00:09:43,390;00:09:45,161;No need for such formality.
83;00:09:45,735;00:09:47,806;You were Catelyn Stark's sworn sword.
84;00:09:47,926;00:09:49,739;I was.
84;00:09:47,926;00:09:49,739;Strange.
85;00:09:50,101;00:09:52,840;I knew Cat since the time we were children.
85;00:09:50,101;00:09:52,840;She never mentioned you.
86;00:09:53,591;00:09:55,337;It was after Renly's murder.
87;00:09:55,457;00:09:56,659;Ah, yes.
88;00:09:56,931;00:09:58,553;You were accused of killing him.
89;00:09:58,673;00:09:59,975;I tried to save him.
90;00:10:00,095;00:10:03,066;But you were accused.
90;00:10:00,095;00:10:03,066;By men who did not see what happened.
91;00:10:03,186;00:10:04,438;And what did happen?
92;00:10:09,497;00:10:11,325;He was murdered by a shadow.
93;00:10:11,896;00:10:14,484;A shadow with the face
93;00:10:11,896;00:10:14,484;of Stannis Baratheon.
94;00:10:14,604;00:10:16,807;A shadow?
95;00:10:18,253;00:10:19,776;With a face?
96;00:10:22,357;00:10:24,540;This woman swore to protect Renly,
97;00:10:24,660;00:10:25,855;she failed.
98;00:10:25,975;00:10:27,502;She swore to protect your mother,
99;00:10:28,363;00:10:29,423;she failed.
100;00:10:29,878;00:10:33,508;Why would I want somebody with your
100;00:10:29,878;00:10:33,508;history of failure guarding Lady Sansa?
101;00:10:33,628;00:10:35,506;Why should you have any
101;00:10:33,628;00:10:35,506;say in her affairs?
102;00:10:35,626;00:10:36,990;Because I am her uncle.
103;00:10:37,110;00:10:40,595;I married her Aunt Lysa shortly
103;00:10:37,110;00:10:40,595;before my beloved's untimely death.
104;00:10:40,848;00:10:43,679;We're family now. And you are an outsider.
105;00:10:43,799;00:10:44,870;Forgive me, Lady Brienne.
106;00:10:44,990;00:10:47,917;But experience has made
106;00:10:44,990;00:10:47,917;me wary of outsiders.
107;00:10:48,037;00:10:49,402;Lady Sansa...
108;00:10:49,522;00:10:51,672;if we can have a word alone...
108;00:10:49,522;00:10:51,672;No.
109;00:10:52,269;00:10:55,350;Please, my Lady, if I can explain...
109;00:10:52,269;00:10:55,350;I saw you at Joffrey's wedding...
110;00:10:55,470;00:10:56,653;bowing to the king.
111;00:10:56,878;00:10:58,611;Neither of us wanted to be there.
112;00:11:00,276;00:11:03,245;Sometimes we don't have a choice.
112;00:11:00,276;00:11:03,245;And sometimes we do.
113;00:11:05,290;00:11:06,488;You should leave.
114;00:11:07,985;00:11:10,829;We don't want our new friend
114;00:11:07,985;00:11:10,829;wandering the countryside alone.
115;00:11:10,949;00:11:12,600;The roads in these parts aren't safe.
116;00:11:13,124;00:11:14,459;Why don't you stay?
117;00:11:23,599;00:11:25,620;I'm gonna ask you to stay.
118;00:12:13,314;00:12:15,135;Stop! Stop! After him!
119;00:12:16,756;00:12:17,779;Podrick!
120;00:12:55,646;00:12:57,217;Stop, stop, stop, stop!
121;00:12:57,654;00:12:59,014;Stop!
122;00:13:02,095;00:13:03,614;That's a good boy. Come on.
123;00:13:03,888;00:13:04,811;Come on!
124;00:13:07,169;00:13:08,653;No, no, no, stop!
125;00:13:28,989;00:13:30,486;Guess that means you're unarmed.
126;00:13:31,908;00:13:33,305;Don't! Put that down!
127;00:13:53,229;00:13:53,978;Podrick?
128;00:13:55,038;00:13:56,011;Yes, my Lady?
129;00:13:56,760;00:13:57,982;You can stand now.
130;00:13:58,682;00:13:59,581;Yes, my Lady.
131;00:14:04,096;00:14:05,181;Sansa Stark?
132;00:14:06,441;00:14:08,437;Wary of strangers, as she should be.
133;00:14:08,849;00:14:11,319;I saw her riding on the
133;00:14:08,849;00:14:11,319;Eastroad with Littlefinger.
134;00:14:11,680;00:14:13,477;We'll follow them.
134;00:14:11,680;00:14:13,477;My Lady...
135;00:14:14,188;00:14:16,408;if both Stark girls refused your service,
136;00:14:17,181;00:14:18,691;maybe you're released from your vow.
137;00:14:19,090;00:14:21,152;I swore to their mother
137;00:14:19,090;00:14:21,152;I would protect those girls.
138;00:14:21,272;00:14:22,552;They don't want your protection.
139;00:14:22,582;00:14:24,143;You think she's safe with Littlefinger?
140;00:14:26,990;00:14:28,038;No, my Lady.
141;00:14:28,337;00:14:29,772;Get your horse.
142;00:14:39,586;00:14:41,145;A summons from the Queen.
143;00:14:59,860;00:15:01,818;There are only two like it in the world.
144;00:15:03,066;00:15:05,423;The one I'm wearing and the
144;00:15:03,066;00:15:05,423;one I gave to Myrcella.
145;00:15:05,913;00:15:06,874;It's a threat.
146;00:15:06,994;00:15:08,583;Of course it's a threat.
147;00:15:09,294;00:15:13,621;Our daughter is alone in Dorne surrounded
147;00:15:09,294;00:15:13,621;by people who hate our family.
148;00:15:14,648;00:15:16,856;It's a threat,
149;00:15:18,534;00:15:19,270;No note?
150;00:15:19,390;00:15:22,217;They blame us for the death
150;00:15:19,390;00:15:22,217;of Oberyn and his sister.
151;00:15:22,534;00:15:24,117;And every other tragedy that
152;00:15:24,237;00:15:25,820;has befallen their accursed country.
153;00:15:25,940;00:15:28,365;I will burn their cities to
153;00:15:25,940;00:15:28,365;the ground if they touch her.
154;00:15:28,485;00:15:29,313;Softer.
155;00:15:29,433;00:15:30,146;What?
156;00:15:30,266;00:15:31,194;Not so loud.
157;00:15:31,314;00:15:34,413;Our daughter is in danger and you're worried
157;00:15:31,314;00:15:34,413;I am speaking too loudly?
158;00:15:34,533;00:15:36,406;No one can know she's our daughter.
159;00:15:37,937;00:15:40,042;Then don't call her your daughter.
160;00:15:40,331;00:15:42,028;You've never been a father to her.
161;00:15:42,148;00:15:44,647;If I was a father to any of my children,
161;00:15:42,148;00:15:44,647;they'd be stoned in the streets.
162;00:15:44,767;00:15:46,169;And what has your caution brought?
163;00:15:48,095;00:15:50,478;Our eldest child murdered
163;00:15:48,095;00:15:50,478;at his own wedding,
164;00:15:51,026;00:15:53,372;our only daughter shipped off to Dorne,
165;00:15:54,724;00:15:58,878;our baby boy set to marry that
165;00:15:54,724;00:15:58,878;smirking whore from Highgarden!
166;00:16:08,039;00:16:09,286;I'm gonna make things better.
167;00:16:09,406;00:16:10,767;You've never made anything better.
168;00:16:10,864;00:16:12,033;I'm going to Dorne.
169;00:16:12,533;00:16:14,130;And I'm bringing our daughter home.
170;00:16:15,065;00:16:18,695;You can't just ask Prince
170;00:16:15,065;00:16:18,695;Doran to give her back.
171;00:16:19,163;00:16:20,971;She's promised to his son.
172;00:16:21,208;00:16:22,880;I'm not going to ask him anything.
173;00:16:23,703;00:16:25,830;You go down there with an army
173;00:16:23,703;00:16:25,830;it's an act of war.
174;00:16:25,950;00:16:26,803;No army.
175;00:16:27,564;00:16:29,160;Do you know where they're keeping her?
176;00:16:32,690;00:16:34,686;Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
177;00:16:35,110;00:16:36,046;I'll find her.
178;00:16:39,345;00:16:40,879;Is there anything else, Your Grace?
179;00:16:44,553;00:16:45,800;You're going to Dorne.
180;00:16:47,022;00:16:48,806;A one-handed man.
181;00:16:49,579;00:16:50,814;Alone.
182;00:16:51,805;00:16:53,676;Who said I was going alone?
183;00:17:01,985;00:17:04,343;No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.
184;00:17:04,567;00:17:06,775;Roses are very nice,
184;00:17:04,567;00:17:06,775;definitely roses.
185;00:17:06,895;00:17:08,607;And music. I adore music.
186;00:17:08,727;00:17:09,929;But no flutes.
187;00:17:10,049;00:17:12,860;I hate flutes. We can have a harp,
187;00:17:10,049;00:17:12,860;if you like, but no flutes.
188;00:17:12,980;00:17:13,860;Then there's the food.
189;00:17:13,888;00:17:16,113;The food is the most important thing,
189;00:17:13,888;00:17:16,113;don't you agree?
190;00:17:16,233;00:17:17,822;We're gonna need pigeon pies.
191;00:17:18,062;00:17:20,420;That's what they eat in the capital,
191;00:17:18,062;00:17:20,420;don't they?
192;00:17:21,218;00:17:22,827;Don't they?
193;00:17:24,592;00:17:25,490;Don't who?
194;00:17:25,714;00:17:28,989;People eat pigeon pie in the capital.
195;00:17:29,675;00:17:31,434;They certainly do, my dear.
196;00:17:31,664;00:17:33,036;They certainly do.
197;00:17:34,022;00:17:35,831;It's a fine place, isn't it?
198;00:17:36,585;00:17:38,157;A fine place.
199;00:17:38,718;00:17:42,342;I never thought I'd end up settling down
199;00:17:38,718;00:17:42,342;in a place like this.
200;00:17:42,965;00:17:43,951;You won't.
201;00:17:45,604;00:17:46,277;Pardon?
202;00:17:46,514;00:17:48,398;We won't get to live at Stokeworth.
203;00:17:48,518;00:17:51,460;When mother dies, my sister gets the castle
203;00:17:48,518;00:17:51,460;because she's older.
204;00:17:51,784;00:17:53,456;She hates me.
205;00:17:53,576;00:17:55,056;She calls me mean names and sometimes
206;00:17:55,160;00:17:57,909;even still she pulls my hair
206;00:17:55,160;00:17:57,909;when mother's not looking.
207;00:18:00,114;00:18:01,386;You know what I think?
208;00:18:02,160;00:18:03,831;I think you're a good person.
209;00:18:04,455;00:18:06,625;And your sister is a mean person.
210;00:18:06,745;00:18:07,636;She is.
211;00:18:10,255;00:18:11,540;I've been all over the world
212;00:18:11,920;00:18:13,554;and if there's one thing I've learned,
213;00:18:14,140;00:18:16,086;is that meanness comes around.
214;00:18:17,121;00:18:18,568;People like your sister,
215;00:18:19,279;00:18:21,767;they always get what's coming for them,
215;00:18:19,279;00:18:21,767;eventually.
216;00:18:22,566;00:18:24,250;One way or another.
217;00:18:27,774;00:18:28,884;Who's that?
218;00:18:32,258;00:18:33,892;Jaime fucking Lannister.
219;00:18:36,318;00:18:37,142;Ser Jaime?
220;00:18:37,262;00:18:38,539;Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
221;00:18:40,345;00:18:42,453;I was very sorry to hear about your father.
222;00:18:42,908;00:18:43,657;Thank you.
223;00:18:44,580;00:18:46,937;This is my betrothed, Lollys.
224;00:18:48,777;00:18:49,999;A pleasure.
225;00:18:53,030;00:18:54,091;Run along, love.
226;00:19:00,979;00:19:03,038;Beautiful young bride you've chosen.
227;00:19:03,749;00:19:05,389;When are you planning on getting married?
228;00:19:05,520;00:19:06,481;Just get on with it.
229;00:19:06,767;00:19:07,666;On with what?
230;00:19:07,786;00:19:08,925;What you're here for.
231;00:19:09,358;00:19:12,526;There's no way this little visit
231;00:19:09,358;00:19:12,526;could possibly mean anything good for me.
232;00:19:12,646;00:19:13,774;It's very good for you.
233;00:19:26,445;00:19:28,939;Lollys will be marrying Ser Willys Bracken.
234;00:19:29,164;00:19:30,276;Mmm.
235;00:19:30,641;00:19:32,882;We've made a deal, your sister and I.
236;00:19:33,224;00:19:34,905;I would have advised against that.
237;00:19:35,025;00:19:36,123;How is this good for me?
238;00:19:36,243;00:19:39,163;Because you're going to come with me
238;00:19:36,243;00:19:39,163;and help me with something important.
239;00:19:39,193;00:19:40,703;And when we return...
240;00:19:40,823;00:19:44,553;I'm gonna give you a much better girl
240;00:19:40,823;00:19:44,553;and a much better castle.
241;00:19:47,135;00:19:49,060;Return from where?
242;00:19:49,518;00:19:51,981;As far south as south goes.
243;00:20:16,265;00:20:18,255;You are my queen.
244;00:20:27,097;00:20:29,253;The prince does not
244;00:20:27,097;00:20:29,253;wish to be disturbed.
245;00:20:29,450;00:20:30,888;Remove yourself from my path
246;00:20:30,923;00:20:32,958;or I'll take that long axe
246;00:20:30,923;00:20:32,958;and I'll shove it up your...
247;00:20:32,993;00:20:34,082;Captain...
248;00:20:35,992;00:20:37,328;let her pass.
249;00:20:41,775;00:20:43,354;Your brother was murdered...
250;00:20:44,077;00:20:46,235;and you sit here
250;00:20:44,077;00:20:46,235;in the Water Gardens
251;00:20:46,270;00:20:48,570;staring at the sky
251;00:20:46,270;00:20:48,570;and doing nothing.
252;00:20:48,605;00:20:51,140;Oberyn was slain
252;00:20:48,605;00:20:51,140;during a trial by combat
253;00:20:51,142;00:20:52,853;by law, that is no murder.
254;00:20:52,855;00:20:55,479;Your brother...
254;00:20:52,855;00:20:55,479;You don't have to remind me.
255;00:20:55,514;00:20:58,720;He was my brother long
255;00:20:55,514;00:20:58,720;before he was anything to you.
256;00:20:59,103;00:21:00,302;What will you know about his death?
257;00:21:00,304;00:21:03,025;I will bury him.
257;00:21:00,304;00:21:03,025;I will mourn for him.
258;00:21:03,060;00:21:04,075;And then?
259;00:21:04,110;00:21:05,388;You would have me go to war.
260;00:21:05,390;00:21:07,133;The whole country
260;00:21:05,390;00:21:07,133;would have you go to war.
261;00:21:07,168;00:21:10,309;Then we are lucky
261;00:21:07,168;00:21:10,309;the whole country does not decide.
262;00:21:12,443;00:21:14,310;The Sand Snakes are with me.
263;00:21:14,345;00:21:15,929;They have the love of their people.
264;00:21:15,964;00:21:17,182;They will avenge their father
265;00:21:17,184;00:21:21,153;while you sit here
265;00:21:17,184;00:21:21,153;in your chair doing nothing.
266;00:21:25,643;00:21:27,182;Oberyn is dead.
267;00:21:28,041;00:21:30,968;And this Lannister girl
267;00:21:28,041;00:21:30,968;skips about the Water Gardens
268;00:21:30,970;00:21:34,293;eating our food,
268;00:21:30,970;00:21:34,293;breathing our air.
269;00:21:35,382;00:21:36,854;How many of your
269;00:21:35,382;00:21:36,854;brothers and sisters
270;00:21:36,856;00:21:38,540;do they have to kill?
271;00:21:39,637;00:21:41,033;Let me have her.
272;00:21:42,960;00:21:47,063;Let me send her to Cersei
272;00:21:42,960;00:21:47,063;one finger at a time.
273;00:21:48,360;00:21:50,451;I loved my brother.
274;00:21:50,486;00:21:52,721;And you made him very happy.
275;00:21:52,756;00:21:55,638;For that, you will always
275;00:21:52,756;00:21:55,638;have a place in my heart.
276;00:21:56,937;00:22:01,335;But we do not mutilate
276;00:21:56,937;00:22:01,335;little girls for vengeance.
277;00:22:01,370;00:22:02,954;Not here.
278;00:22:02,989;00:22:04,989;Not while I rule.
279;00:22:06,083;00:22:07,782;And how long would that be?
280;00:22:24,102;00:22:26,301;The Unsullied are too conspicuous.
281;00:22:26,697;00:22:29,031;Anyone can see them coming from a mile off.
282;00:22:29,602;00:22:31,674;'Course you haven't found any
282;00:22:29,602;00:22:31,674;Sons of the Harpy.
283;00:22:32,204;00:22:33,599;You haven't, have you?
284;00:22:35,761;00:22:38,202;My Second Sons
284;00:22:35,761;00:22:38,202;on the other hand...
285;00:22:38,647;00:22:43,133;they drink, they whore,
285;00:22:38,647;00:22:43,133;fight in streets,
286;00:22:43,635;00:22:44,879;they blend in.
287;00:22:44,914;00:22:47,214;They overhear things in taverns.
288;00:22:47,349;00:22:50,797;Follow people from the taverns
288;00:22:47,349;00:22:50,797;to nice quiet alleys.
289;00:22:51,229;00:22:55,303;Break a few fingers,
289;00:22:51,229;00:22:55,303;overhear a few more things...
290;00:22:56,624;00:22:58,026;before you know it...
291;00:23:17,836;00:23:19,273;No one here.
292;00:23:20,203;00:23:21,371;We go.
293;00:23:21,606;00:23:23,174;In a hurry?
294;00:23:23,209;00:23:24,151;You're afraid?
295;00:23:24,186;00:23:26,634;Unsullied fear nothing.
296;00:23:27,254;00:23:28,820;Right.
297;00:23:28,921;00:23:30,332;That's your problem.
298;00:23:30,467;00:23:34,630;You understood fear once, long ago,
298;00:23:30,467;00:23:34,630;but you forgot what it means.
299;00:23:35,472;00:23:37,486;Someone who's forgotten fear...
300;00:23:38,003;00:23:39,975;has forgotten how to hide.
301;00:23:48,770;00:23:50,725;Fear is useful that way.
302;00:24:15,357;00:24:16,680;Sons of the Harpy...
303;00:24:16,715;00:24:19,002;they want to put a collar
303;00:24:16,715;00:24:19,002;back on my neck.
304;00:24:19,237;00:24:21,437;On all of our necks.
304;00:24:19,237;00:24:21,437;Please, Your Grace...
305;00:24:21,472;00:24:23,872;you must kill him.
305;00:24:21,472;00:24:23,872;It would send a message.
306;00:24:23,907;00:24:26,007;I think you should
306;00:24:23,907;00:24:26,007;exercise restraint...
307;00:24:26,042;00:24:27,185;Your Grace.
307;00:24:26,042;00:24:27,185;Why?
308;00:24:27,187;00:24:29,307;Well, for one thing, he
308;00:24:27,187;00:24:29,307;may have valuable information.
309;00:24:29,329;00:24:32,497;Well, the Son of the Harpy
309;00:24:29,329;00:24:32,497;has no more valuable information.
310;00:24:32,532;00:24:33,673;How do you know that?
311;00:24:33,708;00:24:35,411;Because I questioned him.
312;00:24:35,922;00:24:38,406;And the information you did get...
312;00:24:35,922;00:24:38,406;he is young and..
313;00:24:38,441;00:24:39,545;He is born free.
314;00:24:39,580;00:24:40,759;Why should he want
314;00:24:39,580;00:24:40,759;to bring back slavery?
315;00:24:40,794;00:24:41,830;What did it do for him?
316;00:24:41,865;00:24:43,330;Perhaps the only thing
316;00:24:41,865;00:24:43,330;that gave him pride
317;00:24:43,450;00:24:45,186;was knowing that there was
317;00:24:43,450;00:24:45,186;someone lower than he was.
318;00:24:45,221;00:24:46,554;They pay him.
319;00:24:46,589;00:24:48,789;Great families, afraid to do a thing.
320;00:24:48,824;00:24:50,079;They pay poor men
320;00:24:48,824;00:24:50,079;to do it for them.
321;00:24:50,114;00:24:51,192;And how do you know this?
322;00:24:51,227;00:24:52,927;Everyone know this.
322;00:24:51,227;00:24:52,927;I don't know it.
323;00:24:52,962;00:24:54,129;And I'm the head of a great family.
324;00:24:54,164;00:24:56,698;We do not know what
324;00:24:54,164;00:24:56,698;this man did or didn't do.
325;00:24:56,733;00:24:58,933;Give him a trial at least.
326;00:24:58,968;00:25:00,454;A fair trial.
327;00:25:01,103;00:25:02,440;Show all the citizens of Meereen
328;00:25:02,475;00:25:04,999;that you are better than those
328;00:25:02,475;00:25:04,999;who would depose you.
329;00:25:05,234;00:25:06,426;Teach them a better way.
330;00:25:06,461;00:25:09,022;I do not know the place
330;00:25:06,461;00:25:09,022;from where old ser comes.
331;00:25:09,057;00:25:11,868;Things maybe are different there, I hope.
332;00:25:12,359;00:25:15,540;But here, in Meereen,
332;00:25:12,359;00:25:15,540;before Daenerys Stormborn
333;00:25:15,575;00:25:17,107;they own us.
334;00:25:17,403;00:25:19,346;So we learn much about them...
335;00:25:19,781;00:25:21,526;or we do not live long.
336;00:25:21,897;00:25:23,882;They teach me what they are.
337;00:25:24,349;00:25:26,558;Mercy, fair trial...
338;00:25:26,593;00:25:28,593;these mean nothing to them.
339;00:25:28,628;00:25:30,628;All they understand is blood.
340;00:25:35,964;00:25:37,467;Thank you all for your council.
341;00:25:46,545;00:25:47,485;Your Grace...
342;00:25:47,520;00:25:49,120;a word, please, I beg you.
343;00:25:49,155;00:25:50,179;About what?
344;00:25:50,214;00:25:51,842;About your father.
345;00:25:51,877;00:25:53,877;About the Mad King.
345;00:25:51,877;00:25:53,877;The Mad King?
346;00:25:53,912;00:25:55,544;You're here to remind me
346;00:25:53,912;00:25:55,544;of my enemies' lies?
347;00:25:55,579;00:25:56,806;Consider me reminded.
348;00:25:56,841;00:25:58,740;Your Grace...
349;00:25:58,775;00:26:00,571;I served in his Kingsguard.
350;00:26:01,240;00:26:03,297;I was at his side
350;00:26:01,240;00:26:03,297;from the first.
351;00:26:03,332;00:26:05,532;Your enemies did not lie.
352;00:26:07,150;00:26:08,372;Go on.
353;00:26:10,379;00:26:13,203;When the people rose
353;00:26:10,379;00:26:13,203;and revolted against him
354;00:26:13,238;00:26:15,734;your father set their tongues
354;00:26:13,238;00:26:15,734;cast them in flames.
355;00:26:16,810;00:26:19,320;He murdered sons
355;00:26:16,810;00:26:19,320;in front of their fathers.
356;00:26:20,149;00:26:22,429;He burned men alive
356;00:26:20,149;00:26:22,429;with wildfire
357;00:26:22,464;00:26:24,364;and laughed as they screamed,
358;00:26:25,520;00:26:27,851;and his efforts to stamp out dissent
359;00:26:29,069;00:26:31,621;led to a rebellion
359;00:26:29,069;00:26:31,621;that killed every Targaryen...
360;00:26:32,106;00:26:33,502;except two.
361;00:26:34,549;00:26:36,112;I'm not my father.
362;00:26:36,147;00:26:38,685;No, Your Grace, thank the gods.
363;00:26:39,709;00:26:43,811;But the Mad King gave his enemies
363;00:26:39,709;00:26:43,811;the justice he thought they deserved.
364;00:26:43,846;00:26:46,726;And each time,
364;00:26:43,846;00:26:46,726;it made him feel powerful...
365;00:26:46,761;00:26:48,035;and right...
366;00:26:48,911;00:26:50,394;until the very end.
367;00:26:55,349;00:26:58,824;I will not have the Son of the Harpy
367;00:26:55,349;00:26:58,824;executed without a fair trial.
368;00:27:02,650;00:27:04,115;Your Grace.
369;00:27:14,001;00:27:15,380;There's a bug.
370;00:27:15,415;00:27:16,889;Yes, best be careful.
371;00:27:16,924;00:27:19,713;You might accidentally
371;00:27:16,924;00:27:19,713;consume some solid food.
372;00:27:19,748;00:27:24,442;When I agreed to come with you,
372;00:27:19,748;00:27:24,442;did I misrepresent my intentions?
373;00:27:28,751;00:27:34,018;Besides, what else is there for me
373;00:27:28,751;00:27:34,018;to do inside this fucking box?
374;00:27:34,053;00:27:35,953;You don't like it?
374;00:27:34,053;00:27:35,953;I want to take a walk.
375;00:27:35,988;00:27:37,157;You can't.
376;00:27:37,192;00:27:40,389;Cersei has offered a lordship
376;00:27:37,192;00:27:40,389;to the man who brings her your head.
377;00:27:40,424;00:27:42,824;She ought to offer her cunt.
378;00:27:42,859;00:27:45,159;Best part of her
378;00:27:42,859;00:27:45,159;for the best part of me.
379;00:27:45,810;00:27:49,109;Well, I suppose a box is as good
379;00:27:45,810;00:27:49,109;a place for me as anywhere.
380;00:27:49,833;00:27:52,437;Are we really going to
380;00:27:49,833;00:27:52,437;spend the entire road to Volantis
381;00:27:52,472;00:27:54,572;talking about the
381;00:27:52,472;00:27:54,572;futility of everything.
382;00:27:54,607;00:27:56,502;You're right, there's no point.
383;00:27:56,893;00:27:58,978;The road to Volantis?
384;00:27:58,980;00:28:01,888;You said we are going to Meereen.
384;00:27:58,980;00:28:01,888;What's in Volantis?
385;00:28:01,923;00:28:03,299;The road to Meereen.
386;00:28:03,334;00:28:07,118;And what do you hope to find
386;00:28:03,334;00:28:07,118;at the end of the road to Meereen?
387;00:28:07,153;00:28:09,153;I told you.
387;00:28:07,153;00:28:09,153;A ruler.
388;00:28:09,188;00:28:11,388;But you've already got a ruler.
389;00:28:11,423;00:28:14,078;Everywhere has already got a ruler.
390;00:28:14,113;00:28:16,653;Every pile of shit
390;00:28:14,113;00:28:16,653;on the side of every road
391;00:28:16,688;00:28:18,788;has someone's banner
391;00:28:16,688;00:28:18,788;hanging from it.
392;00:28:18,823;00:28:20,610;You are quite good, do you know?
393;00:28:21,177;00:28:22,563;At ruling.
394;00:28:23,178;00:28:25,353;During your brief tenure as Hand.
395;00:28:25,828;00:28:27,288;I didn't rule, I was a servant.
396;00:28:27,323;00:28:29,840;Still, a man of talent.
397;00:28:29,875;00:28:31,446;Managed to kill a lot of people?
398;00:28:31,481;00:28:35,628;Yes, but you showed great
398;00:28:31,481;00:28:35,628;promise in other areas as well.
399;00:28:38,779;00:28:41,044;She wanted me
399;00:28:38,779;00:28:41,044;to leave King's Landing.
400;00:28:42,054;00:28:43,186;She begged me.
401;00:28:43,919;00:28:45,366;I wouldn't go.
402;00:28:45,401;00:28:46,556;Why?
403;00:28:46,591;00:28:48,066;'Cause I liked it.
404;00:28:49,349;00:28:51,160;Power...
405;00:28:51,195;00:28:52,661;even as a servant.
406;00:28:53,170;00:28:56,151;People follow leaders
407;00:28:56,186;00:28:57,899;and they will never follow us.
408;00:28:57,934;00:28:59,934;They find us repulsive.
409;00:28:59,969;00:29:01,199;I find us repulsive.
410;00:29:01,234;00:29:03,605;And we find them...
410;00:29:01,234;00:29:03,605;repulsive, which is why
411;00:29:03,640;00:29:06,498;we surround ourselves
411;00:29:03,640;00:29:06,498;with large comfortable boxes
412;00:29:06,500;00:29:07,977;to keep them away.
413;00:29:08,806;00:29:10,032;And yet...
414;00:29:10,900;00:29:12,474;no matter what we do...
415;00:29:13,078;00:29:17,579;people like you and me are never
415;00:29:13,078;00:29:17,579;really satisfied inside the box.
416;00:29:17,614;00:29:18,898;Not for long.
417;00:29:20,403;00:29:21,531;You're right.
418;00:29:22,301;00:29:24,604;Let's go for a walk.
418;00:29:22,301;00:29:24,604;No.
419;00:29:24,639;00:29:27,178;How many dwarves
419;00:29:24,639;00:29:27,178;are there in the world?
420;00:29:27,869;00:29:29,832;Is Cersei
420;00:29:27,869;00:29:29,832;going to kill them all?
421;00:29:34,618;00:29:36,303;Not him.
422;00:29:36,338;00:29:38,638;You're trying
422;00:29:36,338;00:29:38,638;to deceive your queen?
423;00:29:38,673;00:29:40,773;Should I throw them
423;00:29:38,673;00:29:40,773;in a cell, Your Grace?
424;00:29:40,808;00:29:42,448;It won't be necessary,
424;00:29:40,808;00:29:42,448;Ser Meryn.
425;00:29:42,483;00:29:44,929;I don't want to dissuade
425;00:29:42,483;00:29:44,929;the other hunters.
426;00:29:45,423;00:29:47,127;Mistakes will be made.
427;00:29:47,162;00:29:47,926;Thank you, Your Grace.
427;00:29:47,162;00:29:47,926;Thanks.
428;00:29:47,928;00:29:48,782;Thank you, Your Grace.
428;00:29:47,928;00:29:48,782;Thank you.
429;00:29:48,817;00:29:49,777;Take the head.
430;00:29:49,812;00:29:50,684;Let me, Your Grace.
431;00:29:50,719;00:29:52,719;I would take it
431;00:29:50,719;00:29:52,719;if you don't mind.
432;00:29:52,754;00:29:54,754;It could prove
432;00:29:52,754;00:29:54,754;useful for my work.
433;00:29:56,048;00:29:57,189;Very good.
434;00:30:00,311;00:30:01,888;Over there would be fine.
435;00:30:03,357;00:30:05,433;You heard the man, over there.
436;00:30:33,600;00:30:35,147;You're the hand of the King.
437;00:30:35,182;00:30:36,635;No, uncle.
438;00:30:36,670;00:30:40,140;Clearly, it would not be appropriate
438;00:30:36,670;00:30:40,140;for a woman to assume that role.
439;00:30:40,408;00:30:44,587;I'm merely advising my son until he comes
439;00:30:40,408;00:30:44,587;of age and chooses a Hand for himself.
440;00:30:44,822;00:30:48,694;Your Grace, I would be willing
440;00:30:44,822;00:30:48,694;to serve provisionally as the King's Hand
441;00:30:48,729;00:30:51,358;until he becomes full...
441;00:30:48,729;00:30:51,358;You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,
442;00:30:51,393;00:30:53,593;but I don't imagine
442;00:30:51,393;00:30:53,593;we'll have the time.
443;00:30:53,628;00:30:55,843;In addition to be Master of Ships,
444;00:30:55,878;00:30:58,794;the King has appointed

445;00:31:00,131;00:31:01,053;Oh, Your Grace.
446;00:31:01,088;00:31:05,160;He called your experience and wisdom
446;00:31:01,088;00:31:05,160;in financial matters unparalleled.
447;00:31:05,507;00:31:09,619;He said he would be honored to have you
447;00:31:05,507;00:31:09,619;represent the Crown's interest in the same.
448;00:31:09,654;00:31:11,754;The honor is all mine,

455;00:31:32,082;00:31:35,528;what qualifications can he
455;00:31:32,082;00:31:35,528;possibly have for this post?
456;00:31:35,563;00:31:38,144;The qualification of loyalty,

457;00:31:38,179;00:31:40,279;That's far more than

462;00:31:50,005;00:31:53,407;it would please the King if you
462;00:31:50,005;00:31:53,407;would serve as his Master of War.
463;00:31:53,660;00:31:56,353;No man living
463;00:31:53,660;00:31:56,353;better deserves the title.
464;00:31:56,934;00:31:58,452;That is kind of you to say.
465;00:31:59,094;00:32:01,359;I would like to hear it
465;00:31:59,094;00:32:01,359;from the King himself.
466;00:32:01,494;00:32:02,959;Well, the King is very
466;00:32:01,494;00:32:02,959;busy at this moment.
467;00:32:02,994;00:32:05,528;He should be here,
467;00:32:02,994;00:32:05,528;learning what it means to rule.
468;00:32:05,563;00:32:07,032;He is learning.
469;00:32:07,067;00:32:09,184;On this occasion,
469;00:32:07,067;00:32:09,184;in his capacity as ruler,
470;00:32:09,219;00:32:11,219;he's asked me
470;00:32:09,219;00:32:11,219;to speak on his behalf.
471;00:32:11,777;00:32:15,662;I returned to the capital
471;00:32:11,777;00:32:15,662;to pay my respects to my brother,
472;00:32:15,697;00:32:16,776;and to you,
473;00:32:16,811;00:32:18,567;and to serve the King.
474;00:32:18,602;00:32:22,122;I did not return to the capital
474;00:32:18,602;00:32:22,122;to serve as your puppet.
475;00:32:22,157;00:32:25,663;To watch you stack the
475;00:32:22,157;00:32:25,663;Small Council with sycophants.
476;00:32:26,672;00:32:28,182;Sending your own brother away...
477;00:32:28,217;00:32:32,163;My brother has left the capital
477;00:32:28,217;00:32:32,163;to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.
478;00:32:32,198;00:32:33,232;What mission?
479;00:32:33,267;00:32:35,591;That is not your concern
479;00:32:33,267;00:32:35,591;as Master of War.
480;00:32:37,728;00:32:40,217;I do not recognize
480;00:32:37,728;00:32:40,217;your authority to dictate
481;00:32:40,252;00:32:42,755;what is and is not my concern.
482;00:32:43,101;00:32:44,790;You are the Queen Mother.
483;00:32:45,525;00:32:47,076;Nothing more.
484;00:32:50,263;00:32:53,037;You would abandon your king
484;00:32:50,263;00:32:53,037;in his time of need?
485;00:32:53,072;00:32:56,408;If he wants to send for me,
485;00:32:53,072;00:32:56,408;I'll be waiting for him.
486;00:32:56,443;00:32:58,543;At Casterly Rock.
487;00:33:05,851;00:33:08,085;Come on, you know this one.
488;00:33:09,859;00:33:11,228;It looks like an animal.
489;00:33:14,147;00:33:15,707;Snake.
490;00:33:16,146;00:33:18,628;S-S-Sn...
490;00:33:16,146;00:33:18,628;S.
491;00:33:18,663;00:33:21,057;It's an S.
491;00:33:18,663;00:33:21,057;Right, very good.
492;00:33:21,092;00:33:23,768;Hmm, did you know
493;00:33:23,803;00:33:25,523;that the youngest
493;00:33:23,803;00:33:25,523;Lord Commander in history,
494;00:33:25,538;00:33:28,075;Osric Stark,
494;00:33:25,538;00:33:28,075;was elected at the age of 10?
495;00:33:30,083;00:33:31,959;I know S.
496;00:33:31,994;00:33:33,679;You'll learn, I promise.
497;00:33:33,799;00:33:34,423;I taught Ser Davos.
498;00:33:34,425;00:33:36,703;Old people are terrible
498;00:33:34,425;00:33:36,703;at learning new things.
499;00:33:36,738;00:33:38,892;Well, you are a wonderful teacher.
500;00:33:40,411;00:33:41,622;Very patient.
501;00:33:41,657;00:33:44,564;I only said that the more
501;00:33:41,657;00:33:44,564;time that you spend practicing
502;00:33:44,599;00:33:45,664;the faster you will
502;00:33:44,599;00:33:45,664;be able to read.
503;00:33:45,699;00:33:47,112;That's all right.
504;00:33:47,435;00:33:48,766;We're doing just fine.
505;00:33:48,801;00:33:53,148;I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark
505;00:33:48,801;00:33:53,148;have a lot to talk about.
506;00:33:56,225;00:33:58,525;How old were you
506;00:33:56,225;00:33:58,525;when you learned how to read?
507;00:33:58,560;00:34:00,159;3.
507;00:33:58,560;00:34:00,159;3?
508;00:34:00,194;00:34:01,693;Were you taught by your mother?
509;00:34:02,404;00:34:03,483;No.
510;00:34:03,518;00:34:05,418;Our Maester Cressen did.
511;00:34:05,453;00:34:08,887;I had a lot of time to practice.
511;00:34:05,453;00:34:08,887;My mother kept me inside because...
512;00:34:11,635;00:34:15,740;What do you call it in the south?
512;00:34:11,635;00:34:15,740;What happened to your face.
513;00:34:15,775;00:34:17,734;Grayscale.
514;00:34:17,769;00:34:19,649;What would you call it
514;00:34:17,769;00:34:19,649;in the north of the Wall?
515;00:34:20,315;00:34:21,729;I don't know.
516;00:34:22,473;00:34:25,799;But two of my sisters had it.
516;00:34:22,473;00:34:25,799;They both died.
517;00:34:26,060;00:34:27,535;How did they cure you?
518;00:34:27,570;00:34:30,155;I don't remember.
518;00:34:27,570;00:34:30,155;I was a baby.
519;00:34:30,375;00:34:32,592;A lot of people came and tried, I think.
520;00:34:32,627;00:34:34,930;Whatever they did, it went away.
521;00:34:36,742;00:34:38,372;What happened to your sisters?
522;00:34:40,655;00:34:44,769;My father made them move out
522;00:34:40,655;00:34:44,769;to the keep, outside.
523;00:34:45,458;00:34:47,392;None of us were allowed
523;00:34:45,458;00:34:47,392;to go near them.
524;00:34:47,762;00:34:51,784;But we heard them,
524;00:34:47,762;00:34:51,784;especially at night.
525;00:34:52,326;00:34:56,680;They started to sound
525;00:34:52,326;00:34:56,680;not like themselves.
526;00:34:57,315;00:34:58,684;Did you ever see them?
527;00:34:59,827;00:35:01,459;Only once, at the end.
528;00:35:03,409;00:35:04,795;They were covered with it.
529;00:35:06,034;00:35:11,281;Their faces, their arms,
529;00:35:06,034;00:35:11,281;they acted like animals.
530;00:35:12,582;00:35:15,500;My father had to drag them out
530;00:35:12,582;00:35:15,500;to the woods on a rope.
531;00:35:16,400;00:35:18,202;What did he do with
531;00:35:16,400;00:35:18,202;them in the woods?
532;00:35:23,940;00:35:24,981;Mother.
533;00:35:25,511;00:35:26,787;Leave us.
534;00:35:30,001;00:35:31,192;Your Grace.
535;00:35:33,010;00:35:34,580;You need to stay
535;00:35:33,010;00:35:34,580;away from that girl.
536;00:35:34,615;00:35:36,133;Why?
536;00:35:34,615;00:35:36,133;She's a wildling.
537;00:35:36,168;00:35:37,414;Her name's Gilly.
538;00:35:37,449;00:35:39,249;She's nice.
538;00:35:37,449;00:35:39,249;I'm teaching her to read.
539;00:35:39,284;00:35:42,537;She's a wildling.
539;00:35:39,284;00:35:42,537;Your father defeated her people.
540;00:35:42,572;00:35:45,189;He executed their king
540;00:35:42,572;00:35:45,189;for treason.
541;00:35:45,481;00:35:48,460;They could strike at him
541;00:35:45,481;00:35:48,460;by striking at you.
542;00:35:48,495;00:35:50,166;Gilly wouldn't do that.
543;00:35:51,730;00:35:53,888;You have no idea
543;00:35:51,730;00:35:53,888;what people will do.
544;00:35:55,007;00:35:57,219;All your books
544;00:35:55,007;00:35:57,219;and you still don't know.
545;00:36:03,318;00:36:06,012;I ordered Mance Rayder
545;00:36:03,318;00:36:06,012;burned at the stake.
546;00:36:06,047;00:36:08,347;You prevented that order
546;00:36:06,047;00:36:08,347;from being carried out.
547;00:36:08,382;00:36:10,882;You showed mercy
547;00:36:08,382;00:36:10,882;to Mance Rayder.
548;00:36:11,044;00:36:12,707;The King's word is law.
549;00:36:13,514;00:36:17,355;Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos
549;00:36:13,514;00:36:17,355;how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.
550;00:36:21,090;00:36:23,083;Show too much kindness,
550;00:36:21,090;00:36:23,083;people won't fear you.
551;00:36:23,118;00:36:25,218;If they don't fear you,
551;00:36:23,118;00:36:25,218;they don't follow you.
552;00:36:26,041;00:36:28,441;With respect, Your Grace,
552;00:36:26,041;00:36:28,441;the free folk will never follow you
553;00:36:28,445;00:36:29,781;no matter what you do.
554;00:36:30,978;00:36:32,956;You're the man
554;00:36:30,978;00:36:32,956;who burned their king alive.
555;00:36:33,545;00:36:34,791;Who then?
556;00:36:36,865;00:36:38,235;You?
557;00:36:38,270;00:36:41,460;No.
557;00:36:38,270;00:36:41,460;Only one of their own.
558;00:36:43,679;00:36:45,195;Do you know this wretched girl?
559;00:36:46,755;00:36:49,296;Lyanna Mormont.
559;00:36:46,755;00:36:49,296;Lord Commander's niece.
560;00:36:49,690;00:36:51,155;Lady of Bear Island.
561;00:36:51,525;00:36:53,112;And a child of ten.
562;00:36:54,685;00:36:57,561;I asked her to commit her house
562;00:36:54,685;00:36:57,561;to my court. That's her response.
563;00:36:57,817;00:37:00,990;Bear Island knows no king
563;00:36:57,817;00:37:00,990;but the King in the North,
564;00:37:01,025;00:37:03,010;whose name is Stark.
565;00:37:03,359;00:37:05,208;That amuses you.
566;00:37:06,790;00:37:08,550;I apologize, Your Grace.
567;00:37:09,646;00:37:13,189;Northerners commit
567;00:37:09,646;00:37:13,189;a bit like the free folk.
568;00:37:14,131;00:37:15,626;Loyal to their own.
569;00:37:16,043;00:37:17,157;I know.
570;00:37:17,192;00:37:20,359;My brother, Robert, went on often
570;00:37:17,192;00:37:20,359;and loudly about how difficult it was
571;00:37:20,394;00:37:21,890;to control them.
572;00:37:23,913;00:37:25,910;Even with your father's help.
573;00:37:28,681;00:37:31,888;Tonight, the Night's Watch
573;00:37:28,681;00:37:31,888;elect a new Lord Commander.
574;00:37:32,766;00:37:34,501;Ser Alliser Thorne
574;00:37:32,766;00:37:34,501;is going to win.
575;00:37:34,536;00:37:36,555;Most likely.
575;00:37:34,536;00:37:36,555;One pleasant man.
576;00:37:36,991;00:37:38,549;He thinks you're a traitor.
577;00:37:39,736;00:37:41,251;What's your life gonna
577;00:37:39,736;00:37:41,251;be like here at the Wall,
578;00:37:41,286;00:37:44,096;with Thorne in command?
578;00:37:41,286;00:37:44,096;Unpleasant, I expect.
579;00:37:44,131;00:37:45,933;Your bravery made him look weak.
580;00:37:47,410;00:37:48,853;He'll punish you for it.
581;00:37:49,141;00:37:51,063;I don't punish men for bravery.
582;00:37:51,098;00:37:52,592;I reward them.
583;00:37:53,012;00:37:54,727;I don't doubt that, Your Grace.
584;00:37:55,975;00:37:57,728;But I am a brother
584;00:37:55,975;00:37:57,728;of the Night's Watch.
585;00:37:58,065;00:38:00,678;I have pledged them my life,
585;00:37:58,065;00:38:00,678;my honor, my sword.
586;00:38:00,913;00:38:02,813;I don't know what
586;00:38:00,913;00:38:02,813;I have left to give you.
587;00:38:02,848;00:38:04,627;You can give me the North.
588;00:38:06,062;00:38:07,180;I can't.
589;00:38:08,808;00:38:11,027;Even if I wanted to,
589;00:38:08,808;00:38:11,027;I'm a bastard.
590;00:38:11,367;00:38:12,480;A Snow.
591;00:38:13,025;00:38:15,640;Kneel before me.
591;00:38:13,025;00:38:15,640;Lay your sword at my feet.
592;00:38:15,675;00:38:18,539;Pledge me your service
592;00:38:15,675;00:38:18,539;and you'll rise again as Jon Stark,
593;00:38:18,574;00:38:20,089;Lord of Winterfell.
594;00:38:25,867;00:38:28,276;He'll make you a Stark
594;00:38:25,867;00:38:28,276;with a stroke of a pen.
595;00:38:28,740;00:38:30,929;It's the first thing
595;00:38:28,740;00:38:30,929;I ever remember wanting.
596;00:38:32,361;00:38:35,168;I daydreamed that my father
596;00:38:32,361;00:38:35,168;would ask the king.
597;00:38:35,203;00:38:37,601;Just like that I would never be
597;00:38:35,203;00:38:37,601;the Bastard of Winterfell again.
598;00:38:37,636;00:38:40,636;No, you deserve that.
598;00:38:37,636;00:38:40,636;You do.
599;00:38:40,671;00:38:42,830;I-I couldn't be happier for you.
600;00:38:43,851;00:38:45,393;I'm gonna refuse him.
601;00:38:47,426;00:38:48,665;But...
602;00:38:48,700;00:38:50,695;you'd be Lord of Winterfell.
603;00:38:51,315;00:38:53,496;I swore a vow
603;00:38:51,315;00:38:53,496;to the Night's Watch.
604;00:38:53,699;00:38:55,302;If I don't take
604;00:38:53,699;00:38:55,302;my own word seriously,
605;00:38:55,337;00:38:57,537;what sort of Lord of Winterfell
605;00:38:55,337;00:38:57,537;would that be?
606;00:39:01,278;00:39:02,233;Hey.
607;00:39:02,725;00:39:05,910;Crowded,
607;00:39:02,725;00:39:05,910;You'd think we were serving venison stew.
608;00:39:12,882;00:39:17,327;Does anyone wish to speak
608;00:39:12,882;00:39:17,327;for candidates...
609;00:39:17,755;00:39:20,036;before we cast our tokens...
610;00:39:20,413;00:39:26,536;for the 998th Lord Commander
610;00:39:20,413;00:39:26,536;of the Night's Watch?
611;00:39:28,935;00:39:30,743;Ser Alliser Thorne
611;00:39:28,935;00:39:30,743;is not just a knight,
612;00:39:30,778;00:39:32,630;he's a man of true nobility.
613;00:39:32,665;00:39:35,783;He was Acting Commander
613;00:39:32,665;00:39:35,783;when the Wall came under attack
614;00:39:35,818;00:39:37,318;and led us to victory
614;00:39:35,818;00:39:37,318;against the wildlings.
615;00:39:37,353;00:39:38,303;Yes.
616;00:39:38,338;00:39:39,792;He's a veteran of 100 battles
617;00:39:39,827;00:39:43,209;and has been a defender of the Watch
617;00:39:39,827;00:39:43,209;and the Wall almost all of his life.
618;00:39:43,244;00:39:44,408;Nice.
619;00:39:45,055;00:39:46,861;He's the only true choice.
619;00:39:45,055;00:39:46,861;Yes.
620;00:39:46,896;00:39:48,809;Yes.
621;00:39:51,247;00:39:53,945;Ser Denys Mallister
621;00:39:51,247;00:39:53,945;joined the Watch as a boy
622;00:39:53,980;00:39:57,101;and has served loyally
622;00:39:53,980;00:39:57,101;longer than any other Ranger.
623;00:39:57,136;00:39:59,666;That's right.
623;00:39:57,136;00:39:59,666;Through ten winters he served.
624;00:39:59,740;00:40:01,627;As Commander of the Shadow Tower...
625;00:40:01,747;00:40:03,661;he kept the wildlings away.
626;00:40:03,781;00:40:05,396;We could do no better.
627;00:40:09,567;00:40:11,302;If there's no one else...
628;00:40:11,422;00:40:13,281;we will begin the voting.
629;00:40:13,729;00:40:18,231;The triangular tokens count
629;00:40:13,729;00:40:18,231;for Ser Alliser Thorne.
630;00:40:18,543;00:40:22,402;The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister.
631;00:40:22,831;00:40:24,878;Maester Aemon...
632;00:40:26,495;00:40:29,702;Samwell Tarly, go on.
633;00:40:30,738;00:40:32,197;Sam the Slayer.
634;00:40:34,049;00:40:36,831;Another wildling lover,
634;00:40:34,049;00:40:36,831;just like his friend, Jon Snow.
635;00:40:37,274;00:40:38,820;How's your lady love, Slayer?
636;00:40:39,145;00:40:41,215;Her name is Gilly.
637;00:40:41,876;00:40:43,585;Ser Slynt knows her quite well.
638;00:40:44,022;00:40:46,663;They cowered together in the larder
638;00:40:44,022;00:40:46,663;during the battle for the Wall.
639;00:40:46,780;00:40:48,344;Lies!
640;00:40:48,464;00:40:51,173;A wildling girl, a baby,
641;00:40:51,634;00:40:53,281;and Lord Janos.
642;00:40:54,117;00:40:55,957;I found him there after
642;00:40:54,117;00:40:55,957;the battle was over.
643;00:40:56,077;00:40:57,379;In a puddle of his own making.
644;00:41:01,800;00:41:06,141;Whilst Lord Janos was hiding
644;00:41:01,800;00:41:06,141;with the women and children
645;00:41:06,951;00:41:08,299;Jon Snow was leading.
646;00:41:09,524;00:41:11,448;Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true,
647;00:41:11,568;00:41:13,763;but when he was wounded,
647;00:41:11,568;00:41:13,763;it was Jon who saved us.
648;00:41:14,115;00:41:16,405;He took charge of the Wall's defense,
649;00:41:16,525;00:41:18,500;he killed the Magnar of the Thenns,
650;00:41:19,158;00:41:21,399;he went North to deal with Mance Rayder.
651;00:41:21,519;00:41:24,469;Knowing it would almost certainly mean
651;00:41:21,519;00:41:24,469;his own death.
652;00:41:27,904;00:41:29,171;Before that,
653;00:41:30,292;00:41:34,044;he led the mission to avenge
653;00:41:30,292;00:41:34,044;Lord Commander Mormont.
654;00:41:35,424;00:41:38,143;Mormont himself chose
654;00:41:35,424;00:41:38,143;Jon to be his steward.
655;00:41:38,455;00:41:39,902;He saw something in Jon.
656;00:41:40,022;00:41:41,872;And now we've all seen it too.
657;00:41:42,569;00:41:43,866;He may be young,
658;00:41:45,138;00:41:47,177;but he's the commander we turned to
659;00:41:47,297;00:41:48,973;when the night was darkest.
660;00:41:49,093;00:41:50,505;Yeah!
661;00:41:56,655;00:41:57,815;Aye.
662;00:41:58,090;00:42:00,073;Can't argue with any of that.
663;00:42:01,320;00:42:03,591;But who does Jon Snow want to command?
664;00:42:04,052;00:42:05,361;The Night's Watch?
665;00:42:07,070;00:42:08,455;Or the wildlings?
666;00:42:09,284;00:42:12,627;Everyone knows he loved
666;00:42:09,284;00:42:12,627;a wildling girl.
667;00:42:12,747;00:42:14,560;He spoke with Mance Rayder many times.
668;00:42:14,680;00:42:18,050;What would have happened in that tent
668;00:42:14,680;00:42:18,050;between those two old friends
669;00:42:18,599;00:42:20,532;if Stannis's army hadn't come along?
670;00:42:20,814;00:42:25,352;We all saw him put the King-Beyond-the-Wall
670;00:42:20,814;00:42:25,352;out of his misery.
671;00:42:25,617;00:42:28,767;Do you want to choose a man who has fought
671;00:42:25,617;00:42:28,767;the wildlings all his life
672;00:42:29,674;00:42:31,845;or a man who makes love to them?
673;00:42:39,669;00:42:41,116;It is time!
674;00:43:27,912;00:43:30,526;Appears to be a tie, maester.
675;00:43:50,988;00:43:52,832;Jon Snow! Jon Snow!
676;00:43:53,486;00:43:55,271;Jon Snow! Jon Snow!
677;00:43:55,391;00:43:57,412;Jon Snow! Jon Snow!
678;00:44:25,148;00:44:27,584;You! You!
679;00:44:31,271;00:44:32,465;What have you got there?
680;00:44:35,632;00:44:38,215;I said...
680;00:44:35,632;00:44:38,215;Turn around and go!
681;00:44:40,505;00:44:42,089;Turn around...
682;00:44:42,552;00:44:44,866;and go!
682;00:44:42,552;00:44:44,866;That's a nice little sword.
683;00:44:45,207;00:44:47,400;Worth a hundred pigeons a sword like that.
684;00:44:49,836;00:44:52,005;Nothing's worth anything to dead men.
685;00:44:56,025;00:44:57,365;Quickly, go! Go!
686;00:45:11,030;00:45:12,296;Who are you?
687;00:45:13,222;00:45:14,879;Why were they scared of you?
688;00:45:14,999;00:45:16,438;You lost this.
689;00:45:27,939;00:45:29,913;You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.
690;00:45:30,254;00:45:31,472;There isn't.
691;00:45:31,592;00:45:33,689;A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.
692;00:45:36,369;00:45:38,099;Who are you then?
693;00:45:39,025;00:45:40,560;No one.
694;00:45:40,950;00:45:42,826;And that is who a girl must become.
