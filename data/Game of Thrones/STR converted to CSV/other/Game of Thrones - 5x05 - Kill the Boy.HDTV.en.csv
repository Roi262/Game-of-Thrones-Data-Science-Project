1;00:00:00,810;00:00:04,533;When I had refused the throne,
1;00:00:00,810;00:00:04,533;Aerys reigned,
2;00:00:04,653;00:00:07,087;whom they called the Mad King.
3;00:00:07,207;00:00:09,283;You're Aemon Targaryen.
4;00:00:09,403;00:00:12,305;What happened to your face?
4;00:00:09,403;00:00:12,305;Greyscale.
5;00:00:12,425;00:00:14,916;Everyone advised me to send
5;00:00:12,425;00:00:14,916;you to the ruins of Valyria,
6;00:00:15,036;00:00:17,270;to live out your short
6;00:00:15,036;00:00:17,270;life with the Stone Men.
7;00:00:17,390;00:00:21,690;Two of my sisters had it. They were
7;00:00:17,390;00:00:21,690;covered with it. They acted like animals.
8;00:00:23,640;00:00:25,763;Hide! Hide!
9;00:00:29,841;00:00:30,942;Put him in chains.
10;00:00:31,062;00:00:34,758;You want me alive so you can torture me?
11;00:00:35,315;00:00:36,553;Sansa Stark?
12;00:00:36,673;00:00:41,349;I saw her riding on the East Road
12;00:00:36,673;00:00:41,349;with Littlefinger. We'll follow them.
13;00:00:41,469;00:00:45,259;May I introduce my son, Ramsay Bolton.
13;00:00:41,469;00:00:45,259;My Lady.
14;00:00:46,597;00:00:50,613;Welcome home, Lady Stark.
14;00:00:46,597;00:00:50,613;The North remembers.
15;00:00:52,713;00:00:54,873;You let a half-wit escape with a cripple,
16;00:00:54,993;00:00:56,911;and Rickon too, the little one.
17;00:00:57,031;00:00:59,984;I told you what would happen
17;00:00:57,031;00:00:59,984;if you served me loyally.
18;00:01:00,104;00:01:02,266;And what would happen if you did not.
19;00:01:09,598;00:01:11,893;Who are you?
19;00:01:09,598;00:01:11,893;Your captor.
20;00:01:12,349;00:01:14,194;You said you're taking me to the queen.
21;00:01:14,314;00:01:15,777;Queen Daenerys Targaryen.
22;00:01:15,998;00:01:19,560;You're the Mother of Dragons.
22;00:01:15,998;00:01:19,560;Show your strength.
23;00:01:19,680;00:01:24,184;No one's seen Drogon in weeks. For all I
23;00:01:19,680;00:01:24,184;know, he's flown halfway across the world.
24;00:01:24,304;00:01:27,287;The Wise Masters ask for the reopening
24;00:01:24,304;00:01:27,287;of the fighting pits.
25;00:01:27,407;00:01:29,326;Where slaves fought slaves to the death?
26;00:01:29,446;00:01:33,524;Opening them would show the people of
26;00:01:29,446;00:01:33,524;Meereen that you respect their traditions.
27;00:01:33,644;00:01:37,601;Traditions are the only thing
27;00:01:33,644;00:01:37,601;that will hold this city together.
28;00:03:26,838;00:03:37,109;
29;00:04:20,652;00:04:23,020;I'm so sorry, my queen.
30;00:04:23,071;00:04:24,905;He was a good man.
31;00:04:24,940;00:04:28,325;Barristan the Bold
31;00:04:24,940;00:04:28,325;they called him.
32;00:04:28,360;00:04:31,397;He crossed a continent
32;00:04:28,360;00:04:31,397;to serve me.
33;00:04:31,431;00:04:33,933;He was a loyal friend.
34;00:04:35,685;00:04:38,104;And he died in an alley,
35;00:04:38,155;00:04:41,190;butchered by cowards
35;00:04:38,155;00:04:41,190;who hide behind masks.
36;00:04:43,827;00:04:46,445;We could pull back
36;00:04:43,827;00:04:46,445;to the pyramid district,
37;00:04:46,447;00:04:49,782;secure it, and use it as a
37;00:04:46,447;00:04:49,782;base from which to operate.
38;00:04:49,784;00:04:52,952;Then we clean the city out,
39;00:04:53,003;00:04:56,856;neighborhood by neighborhood,
39;00:04:53,003;00:04:56,856;street by street,
40;00:04:56,890;00:04:59,158;until the rats
40;00:04:56,890;00:04:59,158;have nowhere left to hide.
41;00:05:03,013;00:05:05,631;I prefer
41;00:05:03,013;00:05:05,631;your earlier suggestion.
42;00:05:05,633;00:05:09,468;Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's
42;00:05:05,633;00:05:09,468;great families and bring them to me.
43;00:05:10,971;00:05:14,723;But I'm the leader of my family.
44;00:05:16,861;00:05:18,282;No, Your Grace!
45;00:05:18,728;00:05:21,363;I had nothing to do with this.
46;00:05:21,398;00:05:23,315;Your Grace!

59;00:07:59,723;00:08:01,640;Tomorrow perhaps.
60;00:08:37,811;00:08:41,096;And though Daenerys maintains
60;00:08:37,811;00:08:41,096;her grip on Slaver's Bay,
61;00:08:41,147;00:08:44,566;forces rise against her
61;00:08:41,147;00:08:44,566;from within and without.
62;00:08:44,601;00:08:46,685;She refuses to leave

63;00:08:46,736;00:08:49,521;is secure.
64;00:08:50,857;00:08:52,608;She sounds like quite a woman.
65;00:08:52,659;00:08:54,526;And she's alone,
66;00:08:54,577;00:08:56,161;under siege,

72;00:09:16,683;00:09:19,218;is a terrible thing.
73;00:09:22,105;00:09:23,939;Maester Aemon.
74;00:09:23,973;00:09:26,225;Lord Commander.
75;00:09:26,276;00:09:29,228;Sam, I'd like to speak
75;00:09:26,276;00:09:29,228;to the maester alone.
76;00:09:44,577;00:09:46,245;How are you feeling?
77;00:09:46,296;00:09:48,914;Oh, like
77;00:09:46,296;00:09:48,914;a hundred-year-old man
78;00:09:48,965;00:09:51,383;slowly freezing to death.
79;00:09:55,638;00:09:58,557;I need your advice.
80;00:09:58,591;00:10:01,143;There's something I want

81;00:10:01,177;00:10:02,594;have to do.
82;00:10:02,645;00:10:05,047;But it'll divide
82;00:10:02,645;00:10:05,047;the Night's Watch.
83;00:10:05,081;00:10:06,683;Bitterly.
84;00:10:06,932;00:10:09,437;Half the men will hate me
84;00:10:06,932;00:10:09,437;the moment I give the order.
85;00:10:10,144;00:10:13,779;Half the men hate you
85;00:10:10,144;00:10:13,779;already, Lord Commander.
86;00:10:13,813;00:10:15,864;Do it.
87;00:10:15,898;00:10:17,727;But you don't know what it is.
88;00:10:17,847;00:10:19,551;That doesn't matter.
89;00:10:19,586;00:10:20,954;You do.
90;00:10:23,740;00:10:27,793;You will find little joy
90;00:10:23,740;00:10:27,793;in your command.
91;00:10:27,827;00:10:30,379;But with luck,
92;00:10:30,413;00:10:33,975;you will find the strength
92;00:10:30,413;00:10:33,975;to do what needs to be done.
93;00:10:35,990;00:10:39,588;Kill the boy, Jon Snow.
94;00:10:39,639;00:10:43,141;Winter is almost upon us.
95;00:10:43,176;00:10:45,927;Kill the boy
96;00:10:45,979;00:10:49,047;and let the man be born.
97;00:10:57,991;00:11:00,492;Where are the rest
97;00:10:57,991;00:11:00,492;of the free folk now?
98;00:11:00,526;00:11:02,327;Where have they gone?
99;00:11:06,733;00:11:08,800;Who leads them?
100;00:11:08,835;00:11:11,303;They followed Mance.
101;00:11:11,337;00:11:13,727;They won't follow anyone else.
102;00:11:16,520;00:11:18,588;What about you?
103;00:11:19,991;00:11:22,525;Hard to lead
103;00:11:19,991;00:11:22,525;when you're in chains.
104;00:11:26,113;00:11:27,814;What if I unchained you?
105;00:11:27,865;00:11:29,181;Why would you do that?
106;00:11:30,918;00:11:33,820;Because you are not my enemy.
107;00:11:33,871;00:11:35,538;And I'm not yours.
108;00:11:35,573;00:11:38,458;You sure seemed like my enemy
108;00:11:35,573;00:11:38,458;when you were killing my friends.
109;00:11:38,492;00:11:41,244;For 8,000 years the Night's
109;00:11:38,492;00:11:41,244;Watch have sworn an oath
110;00:11:41,295;00:11:44,295;to be the shield that
110;00:11:41,295;00:11:44,295;guards the realms of men.
111;00:11:45,266;00:11:48,468;And for 8,000 years we've
111;00:11:45,266;00:11:48,468;fallen short of that oath.
112;00:11:48,502;00:11:51,588;You belong to the realms of men.
113;00:11:51,622;00:11:53,590;All of you.
114;00:11:53,592;00:11:56,426;And now everything
114;00:11:53,592;00:11:56,426;is going to change?
115;00:11:56,428;00:11:58,428;It is.
115;00:11:56,428;00:11:58,428;Why now?
116;00:11:58,479;00:12:02,482;Because now I am Lord Commander
116;00:11:58,479;00:12:02,482;of the Night's Watch.
117;00:12:02,516;00:12:05,652;What would you have me do,
118;00:12:05,686;00:12:08,104;Lord Commander?
119;00:12:09,774;00:12:11,858;I'd have you go
119;00:12:09,774;00:12:11,858;north of the Wall.
120;00:12:11,909;00:12:15,695;Gather the remaining free folk wherever
120;00:12:11,909;00:12:15,695;they are and bring them back here.
121;00:12:15,746;00:12:19,282;I'll open the gates for
121;00:12:15,746;00:12:19,282;them and let them through.
122;00:12:19,333;00:12:22,419;I'll find them lands to
122;00:12:19,333;00:12:22,419;settle south of the Wall.
123;00:12:22,453;00:12:26,039;They won't kneel for you
123;00:12:22,453;00:12:26,039;and neither will I.
124;00:12:26,090;00:12:28,958;I don't want them
124;00:12:26,090;00:12:28,958;to kneel for me.
125;00:12:28,960;00:12:31,461;I want them to fight with
125;00:12:28,960;00:12:31,461;me when the time comes.
126;00:12:31,463;00:12:34,264;The day I ask my people
126;00:12:31,463;00:12:34,264;to fight with the crows
127;00:12:34,298;00:12:37,217;is the day my people
127;00:12:34,298;00:12:37,217;cut my guts from my belly
128;00:12:37,268;00:12:38,301;and make me eat them.
129;00:12:38,352;00:12:41,271;And how many of your
129;00:12:38,352;00:12:41,271;people can't fight?
130;00:12:41,305;00:12:44,391;The women, the children,
130;00:12:41,305;00:12:44,391;the old, the sick--
131;00:12:44,442;00:12:46,276;what happens to them?
132;00:12:46,310;00:12:48,361;You're condemning them to death.
133;00:12:48,396;00:12:52,182;Worse than death because you're
133;00:12:48,396;00:12:52,182;too proud to make peace.
134;00:12:55,619;00:12:57,721;Or maybe you're not proud.
135;00:12:59,657;00:13:01,241;Maybe you're just a coward.
136;00:13:08,165;00:13:11,251;Easy thing to say
136;00:13:08,165;00:13:11,251;to a man in chains.
137;00:13:35,743;00:13:37,410;Your people need a leader.
138;00:13:37,445;00:13:40,697;And they need to get south of
138;00:13:37,445;00:13:40,697;the Wall before it's too late.
139;00:13:40,699;00:13:42,832;We don't have much time
139;00:13:40,699;00:13:42,832;and they have less.
140;00:13:42,867;00:13:45,785;The walkers are coming and
140;00:13:42,867;00:13:45,785;they'll hit your people first.
141;00:13:47,538;00:13:50,373;I'm not asking you to make
141;00:13:47,538;00:13:50,373;peace to save your skin.
142;00:13:50,424;00:13:54,210;Make peace to save your people.
143;00:14:02,636;00:14:04,888;Most of them are at Hardhome.
144;00:14:04,922;00:14:06,222;You know where that is?
145;00:14:06,224;00:14:08,108;Up on Storrold's Point.
146;00:14:08,142;00:14:10,310;I can give you 10 horses
146;00:14:08,142;00:14:10,310;and nine other men.
147;00:14:10,361;00:14:12,241;You can get there in a week.
148;00:14:12,279;00:14:13,897;We'll need ships.
149;00:14:15,366;00:14:17,901;I'll talk to King Stannis
149;00:14:15,366;00:14:17,901;about lending you his fleet.
150;00:14:21,288;00:14:22,872;All right, then.
151;00:14:24,675;00:14:26,910;You're coming with me.
152;00:14:27,811;00:14:30,580;You're the Lord Commander
152;00:14:27,811;00:14:30,580;of the Night's Watch.
153;00:14:30,631;00:14:32,916;They need to hear it from you.
154;00:14:32,918;00:14:35,218;They need to know
154;00:14:32,918;00:14:35,218;the ships they are boarding
155;00:14:35,252;00:14:37,470;won't be torched
155;00:14:35,252;00:14:37,470;in the middle of the sea.
156;00:14:37,505;00:14:42,675;You come with me or I don't go.
157;00:14:50,602;00:14:53,403;You'd bring wildlings here
157;00:14:50,602;00:14:53,403;through our gates?
158;00:14:53,437;00:14:56,940;Men, women, and children will die
158;00:14:53,437;00:14:56,940;by the thousands if we do nothing.
159;00:14:56,991;00:15:00,193;Let them die. We got our
159;00:14:56,991;00:15:00,193;own to worry about.
160;00:15:00,244;00:15:03,196;Less enemies for us.
161;00:15:03,247;00:15:04,948;Fewer.
162;00:15:04,999;00:15:07,717;What?
162;00:15:04,999;00:15:07,717;Nothing.
163;00:15:07,751;00:15:11,588;Look, well, there is
163;00:15:07,751;00:15:11,588;good farmland in the Gift.
164;00:15:11,622;00:15:13,957;Land that no one uses now.
165;00:15:13,959;00:15:16,009;A dozen abandoned villages.
166;00:15:16,043;00:15:18,178;And why do you think the farmers
166;00:15:16,043;00:15:18,178;abandoned those villages?
167;00:15:18,212;00:15:21,491;Because the wildlings
167;00:15:18,212;00:15:21,491;raided them for years.
168;00:15:21,927;00:15:23,061;Cut them down!
169;00:15:23,622;00:15:25,304;Just like they did this boy's people.
170;00:15:25,956;00:15:28,241;Aye!
171;00:15:28,292;00:15:31,911;We've been fighting
171;00:15:28,292;00:15:31,911;them for thousands of years.
172;00:15:31,962;00:15:33,996;They've slaughtered villages.
173;00:15:33,998;00:15:36,028;They've slaughtered
173;00:15:33,998;00:15:36,028;our brothers.
174;00:15:36,148;00:15:38,301;And we've slaughtered theirs.
175;00:15:39,837;00:15:43,611;I will follow you
175;00:15:39,837;00:15:43,611;anywhere, you know that.
176;00:15:44,919;00:15:47,676;But they killed Grenn.
176;00:15:44,919;00:15:47,676;Yes.
177;00:15:47,677;00:15:49,744;And they killed Pyp.
177;00:15:47,677;00:15:49,744;Aye.
178;00:15:49,864;00:15:52,503;They killed 50 of our brothers.
179;00:15:52,623;00:15:54,934;I can't forget that.
180;00:15:54,985;00:15:56,103;I can't forgive it.
181;00:15:56,223;00:15:58,346;You were at the Fist
181;00:15:56,223;00:15:58,346;of the First Men.
182;00:15:58,907;00:16:01,610;If we abandon them,
182;00:15:58,907;00:16:01,610;you know what they become.
183;00:16:01,730;00:16:03,770;We can learn to live
183;00:16:01,730;00:16:03,770;with the wildlings
184;00:16:03,890;00:16:06,746;or we can add them
184;00:16:03,890;00:16:06,746;to the army of the dead.
185;00:16:06,780;00:16:11,167;Whatever they are now,
185;00:16:06,780;00:16:11,167;they're better than that.
186;00:16:39,027;00:16:40,895;Thank you.
187;00:16:40,946;00:16:42,563;Olly.
188;00:16:44,333;00:16:47,235;If you have something
188;00:16:44,333;00:16:47,235;you want to say to me,
189;00:16:47,237;00:16:48,953;say it.
190;00:16:55,711;00:16:57,745;It's all right.
191;00:16:59,164;00:17:01,249;You don't mean it, do you?
192;00:17:02,885;00:17:05,503;Telling the wildlings
192;00:17:02,885;00:17:05,503;you want to make peace.
193;00:17:05,554;00:17:07,538;You're just doing it
193;00:17:05,554;00:17:07,538;to trick them.
194;00:17:07,573;00:17:09,090;It's not a trick.
195;00:17:09,141;00:17:10,675;They burned my village.
196;00:17:10,726;00:17:12,760;They put an arrow
196;00:17:10,726;00:17:12,760;through my father's head
197;00:17:12,762;00:17:13,962;right in front of me.
198;00:17:14,082;00:17:17,632;They butchered my mother,
198;00:17:14,082;00:17:17,632;everyone I ever knew.
199;00:17:25,390;00:17:28,326;I know what it's like
199;00:17:25,390;00:17:28,326;to lose the people you love.
200;00:17:30,445;00:17:32,747;I know this is hard for you.
201;00:17:34,283;00:17:37,118;But winter is coming.
202;00:17:37,120;00:17:40,655;We know what's coming with it.
203;00:17:40,689;00:17:42,590;We can't face it alone.
204;00:17:48,013;00:17:51,015;Will there be anything else
204;00:17:48,013;00:17:51,015;you need, Lord Commander?
205;00:17:54,253;00:17:55,853;No.
206;00:18:29,338;00:18:31,706;She's far away
206;00:18:29,338;00:18:31,706;from the Lannisters.
207;00:18:32,574;00:18:34,175;This is her home.
208;00:18:37,328;00:18:39,446;Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.
209;00:18:40,698;00:18:43,083;Better off with the Boltons
210;00:18:43,117;00:18:45,786;who murdered
210;00:18:43,117;00:18:45,786;her mother and brother?
211;00:18:54,379;00:18:57,180;Sansa's in danger even
211;00:18:54,379;00:18:57,180;if she doesn't realize it.
212;00:19:11,279;00:19:13,030;Thank you.
213;00:19:14,949;00:19:17,230;You've lived here a long time?
214;00:19:18,486;00:19:20,203;Aye.
215;00:19:20,238;00:19:22,956;Did you know Lord Eddard?
216;00:19:24,545;00:19:27,160;I knew him
217;00:19:27,162;00:19:29,713;and his father before him.
218;00:19:31,466;00:19:33,834;The Starks are gone now.
219;00:19:33,868;00:19:35,669;Not all of them.
220;00:19:35,720;00:19:38,505;I know who's inside that castle.
221;00:19:38,556;00:19:40,424;Everyone knows.
222;00:19:40,475;00:19:41,908;The Boltons.
223;00:19:41,943;00:19:44,303;I'm not talking
223;00:19:41,943;00:19:44,303;about the Boltons.
224;00:19:45,210;00:19:47,931;I need to get a message to her.
225;00:19:47,982;00:19:49,816;To Sansa Stark.
226;00:19:51,886;00:19:53,146;Who are you?
227;00:19:53,266;00:19:56,356;Someone who swore
227;00:19:53,266;00:19:56,356;to keep her safe.
228;00:19:56,358;00:19:58,158;Swore to who?
229;00:19:58,192;00:20:00,360;Her mother.
230;00:20:00,395;00:20:02,279;Her mother's dead.
231;00:20:02,330;00:20:05,082;That doesn't release me
231;00:20:02,330;00:20:05,082;from an oath.
232;00:20:07,752;00:20:10,704;I served Lady Catelyn.
233;00:20:10,706;00:20:13,340;I serve her still.
234;00:20:14,842;00:20:16,810;Who do you serve?
235;00:20:23,184;00:20:25,302;Come back here.
236;00:20:29,006;00:20:30,190;Myranda.
237;00:20:30,224;00:20:32,292;I saw you staring at her.
238;00:20:32,326;00:20:34,027;I'm going to marry her.
239;00:20:34,061;00:20:37,147;That will involve looking
239;00:20:34,061;00:20:37,147;at her from time to time.
240;00:20:40,735;00:20:42,486;You said you'd marry me.
241;00:20:43,704;00:20:45,405;And I meant it.
242;00:20:45,440;00:20:47,541;When I was a bastard named Snow.
243;00:20:47,575;00:20:49,826;But I'm a Bolton now.
244;00:20:49,877;00:20:54,014;What I want is no longer
244;00:20:49,877;00:20:54,014;the primary consideration.
245;00:20:54,048;00:20:56,416;I'm furthering a dynasty.
246;00:20:59,420;00:21:00,754;Do you think she's pretty?
247;00:21:00,805;00:21:03,490;Of course I do.
248;00:21:03,524;00:21:04,925;I'm not blind.
249;00:21:18,072;00:21:20,323;You think she's pretty, too.
250;00:21:23,411;00:21:25,612;I'm looking forward
250;00:21:23,411;00:21:25,612;to our wedding night.
251;00:21:25,663;00:21:29,449;But don't worry, I'll have
251;00:21:25,663;00:21:29,449;plenty of time for you.
252;00:21:29,451;00:21:32,035;Perhaps I'll marry, too.
253;00:21:36,924;00:21:40,043;You're the kennel
253;00:21:36,924;00:21:40,043;master's daughter.
254;00:21:40,094;00:21:43,296;Who are you going to marry,
254;00:21:40,094;00:21:43,296;the stable keeper's son?
255;00:21:49,520;00:21:51,471;You're mine.
256;00:21:52,113;00:21:54,524;You're not going anywhere.
257;00:21:54,559;00:21:56,479;Unless I have to listen
257;00:21:54,559;00:21:56,479;to more of your jealousy.
258;00:21:56,595;00:22:00,113;Jealousy bores me. You remember
258;00:21:56,595;00:22:00,113;what happens to people who bore me.
259;00:22:02,817;00:22:06,736;You're not going to bore
259;00:22:02,817;00:22:06,736;me, are you, Myranda?
260;00:22:25,172;00:22:26,756;Never.
261;00:22:53,584;00:22:55,252;Beg pardon, my lady.
262;00:22:55,286;00:22:57,621;I've come to refill
262;00:22:55,286;00:22:57,621;the wash basin.
263;00:22:57,672;00:22:59,539;Oh, I don't need--
264;00:23:00,708;00:23:03,093;You still have
264;00:23:00,708;00:23:03,093;friends in the North.
265;00:23:03,127;00:23:04,756;If you're ever in trouble,
266;00:23:04,876;00:23:08,765;light a candle in the highest
266;00:23:04,876;00:23:08,765;window of the broken tower.
267;00:23:09,707;00:23:12,385;But who--
267;00:23:09,707;00:23:12,385;You're not alone.
268;00:23:50,141;00:23:52,392;I like your dress.
269;00:23:53,715;00:23:55,562;Who made it for you?
270;00:23:55,596;00:23:58,231;I made it myself.
271;00:23:58,265;00:24:00,266;Really?
272;00:24:02,269;00:24:03,987;Who-- who are you?
273;00:24:04,021;00:24:07,072;I'm Myranda, the kennel
273;00:24:04,021;00:24:07,072;master's daughter.
274;00:24:10,494;00:24:11,778;May I?
275;00:24:18,169;00:24:19,919;Oh, wonderful.
276;00:24:19,954;00:24:21,955;The stitching.
277;00:24:23,290;00:24:25,392;Who taught you?
277;00:24:23,290;00:24:25,392;My mother.
278;00:24:26,488;00:24:30,513;I'm sorry for what
278;00:24:26,488;00:24:30,513;happened to her.
279;00:24:30,548;00:24:31,848;Thank you.
280;00:24:33,634;00:24:35,802;It's good that she taught you.
281;00:24:35,804;00:24:37,303;It was a gift.
282;00:24:37,355;00:24:42,308;Now every time you wear
282;00:24:37,355;00:24:42,308;something you made,
283;00:24:42,310;00:24:44,144;you can remember her.
284;00:24:44,146;00:24:45,679;I'd rather have a mother.
285;00:24:45,713;00:24:49,449;I know.
285;00:24:45,713;00:24:49,449;It's not the same.
286;00:24:49,483;00:24:52,728;Still, it's good to remember.
287;00:24:52,952;00:24:55,372;Remember the way things were.
288;00:24:57,124;00:24:59,626;I almost forgot.
289;00:24:59,660;00:25:02,495;There's something else
290;00:25:02,546;00:25:04,914;to help you remember.
291;00:25:14,392;00:25:16,843;Down there at the end.
292;00:25:18,179;00:25:19,562;What is it?
293;00:25:19,597;00:25:21,514;That would spoil the surprise.
294;00:25:22,604;00:25:25,935;Go ahead, it's perfectly safe.
295;00:25:25,986;00:25:28,154;You won't believe it
295;00:25:25,986;00:25:28,154;when you see it.
296;00:26:30,684;00:26:32,051;Theon?
297;00:26:41,979;00:26:44,347;You shouldn't be here.
298;00:27:04,451;00:27:08,421;You smell particularly
298;00:27:04,451;00:27:08,421;ripe this evening.
299;00:27:10,744;00:27:13,009;Pour me some wine.
300;00:27:37,151;00:27:39,319;Do you have
300;00:27:37,151;00:27:39,319;something to tell me?
301;00:27:40,654;00:27:41,966;No, my lord.
302;00:27:42,086;00:27:43,990;Reek.
303;00:27:47,928;00:27:49,829;She saw me.
304;00:27:49,831;00:27:51,331;Who?
305;00:27:51,382;00:27:54,217;Sansa.
305;00:27:51,382;00:27:54,217;Lady Sansa.
306;00:27:54,251;00:27:55,919;She came to the kennels.
307;00:27:57,115;00:27:58,365;She saw you?
308;00:27:58,416;00:28:00,617;Yes.
308;00:27:58,416;00:28:00,617;I'm sorry, master.
309;00:28:00,668;00:28:02,536;Forgive me.
309;00:28:00,668;00:28:02,536;I didn't think--
310;00:28:02,587;00:28:04,538;Come here.
311;00:28:12,797;00:28:15,599;You mustn't keep
311;00:28:12,797;00:28:15,599;secrets from me, Reek.
312;00:28:15,633;00:28:17,467;Get on your knees.
313;00:28:29,981;00:28:31,898;Give me your hand.
314;00:28:54,005;00:28:55,839;I forgive you.
315;00:29:07,018;00:29:10,153;I trust you find your
315;00:29:07,018;00:29:10,153;chamber suitable, my lady.
316;00:29:10,188;00:29:12,355;Yes, thank you, my lord.
317;00:29:12,357;00:29:14,191;Allow me.
318;00:29:17,995;00:29:19,613;Mother.
319;00:29:19,664;00:29:21,581;Thank you, Ramsay.
320;00:29:31,709;00:29:36,346;My lady, we are all a
320;00:29:31,709;00:29:36,346;family, we northerners.
321;00:29:36,380;00:29:39,800;Our blood ties go back
321;00:29:36,380;00:29:39,800;thousands of years.
322;00:29:39,851;00:29:42,819;So I'd like to drink
322;00:29:39,851;00:29:42,819;to our wedding.
323;00:29:42,854;00:29:46,223;May our happiness
323;00:29:42,854;00:29:46,223;spread from Moat Cailin
324;00:29:46,225;00:29:47,390;to the Last Hearth.
325;00:29:47,442;00:29:49,359;To your wedding.
326;00:29:49,393;00:29:51,311;To your wedding.
327;00:29:57,869;00:30:01,204;It must be difficult for you
327;00:29:57,869;00:30:01,204;being in a strange place.
328;00:30:01,239;00:30:04,074;This isn't a strange place.
328;00:30:01,239;00:30:04,074;This is my home.
329;00:30:04,076;00:30:06,357;It's the people who are strange.
330;00:30:10,665;00:30:12,466;You're right.
331;00:30:12,500;00:30:14,050;Very strange.
332;00:30:17,255;00:30:18,889;More wine, please.
333;00:30:25,396;00:30:28,115;I heard you two had reunited.
334;00:30:28,149;00:30:31,184;A fitting place for it.
335;00:30:33,104;00:30:36,439;I like to imagine that
335;00:30:33,104;00:30:36,439;the last time you spoke
336;00:30:36,491;00:30:38,441;was in this very room.
337;00:30:41,112;00:30:43,780;Are you still angry with him
338;00:30:43,831;00:30:45,699;after he...
339;00:30:50,338;00:30:51,538;what he did?
340;00:30:51,589;00:30:53,924;Don't worry.
341;00:30:53,958;00:30:56,126;The North remembers.
342;00:30:57,512;00:30:59,629;I punished him for it.
343;00:30:59,680;00:31:02,048;He's not ironborn anymore.
344;00:31:02,099;00:31:05,302;Not Theon Greyjoy anymore.
345;00:31:05,304;00:31:07,137;He's a new man.
346;00:31:08,639;00:31:11,608;A new person, anyway.
347;00:31:11,642;00:31:13,310;Aren't you, Reek?
348;00:31:13,312;00:31:14,978;Yes, master.
349;00:31:15,029;00:31:17,197;That's his
349;00:31:15,029;00:31:17,197;new name-- Reek.
350;00:31:17,231;00:31:19,316;Why are you doing this?
351;00:31:21,235;00:31:24,454;Because Reek has
351;00:31:21,235;00:31:24,454;something to say to you.
352;00:31:24,488;00:31:26,089;Don't you, Reek?
353;00:31:36,300;00:31:38,001;An apology.
354;00:31:43,808;00:31:46,977;Apologize to Lady Sansa
354;00:31:43,808;00:31:46,977;for what you did.
355;00:31:48,312;00:31:51,314;Apologize for murdering
355;00:31:48,312;00:31:51,314;her two brothers.
356;00:31:57,188;00:31:58,772;I'm sorry.
357;00:32:00,191;00:32:02,325;Look at her, Reek.
358;00:32:03,494;00:32:05,195;An apology doesn't mean anything
359;00:32:05,197;00:32:07,797;if you're not looking
359;00:32:05,197;00:32:07,797;the person in the eye.
360;00:32:14,005;00:32:16,873;I'm sorry.
360;00:32:14,005;00:32:16,873;- Sorry about what?
361;00:32:18,092;00:32:19,876;For killing your brothers.
362;00:32:30,438;00:32:33,306;There, over and done with.
363;00:32:33,357;00:32:36,860;Doesn't everyone
363;00:32:33,357;00:32:36,860;feel better? I do.
364;00:32:36,894;00:32:39,813;That was getting very tense.
365;00:32:40,698;00:32:42,399;Whew.
366;00:32:45,236;00:32:48,371;You know what, my lady?
367;00:32:48,406;00:32:51,241;What with him having
367;00:32:48,406;00:32:51,241;murdered your brothers
368;00:32:51,292;00:32:53,743;and the rest
368;00:32:51,292;00:32:53,743;of your family gone...
369;00:32:55,796;00:32:59,966;Reek here is the nearest
369;00:32:55,796;00:32:59,966;thing to living kin
370;00:33:00,001;00:33:02,002;that you have left.
371;00:33:03,337;00:33:05,305;Reek.
372;00:33:05,339;00:33:07,223;You will give away the bride.
373;00:33:09,927;00:33:13,563;Someone has to.
373;00:33:09,927;00:33:13,563;What better person?
374;00:33:13,597;00:33:15,065;Good? Good?
375;00:33:15,099;00:33:18,485;Yes, yes, very good.
376;00:33:18,519;00:33:20,520;Wonderful.
377;00:33:22,047;00:33:24,941;Walda and I have
377;00:33:22,047;00:33:24,941;some good news as well,
378;00:33:24,943;00:33:26,743;since we're all together.
379;00:33:32,116;00:33:34,277;We're going to have a baby.
380;00:33:39,840;00:33:41,675;I'm very happy for you.
381;00:33:41,709;00:33:43,677;From the way she's carrying,
382;00:33:43,711;00:33:46,596;Maester Wolkan says
382;00:33:43,711;00:33:46,596;it looks like a boy.
383;00:34:01,979;00:34:03,697;How can you be sure?
384;00:34:03,731;00:34:05,949;Sure of what?
385;00:34:05,983;00:34:07,884;That she's pregnant.
386;00:34:07,918;00:34:09,953;I mean...
387;00:34:09,987;00:34:11,654;how can you tell?
388;00:34:11,656;00:34:15,016;Maester Wolkan has assured
388;00:34:11,656;00:34:15,016;us beyond all doubt.
389;00:34:23,167;00:34:26,586;So how did you manage it?
390;00:34:26,637;00:34:28,471;Manage what?
391;00:34:28,506;00:34:30,840;Getting her pregnant.
392;00:34:30,891;00:34:32,942;I imagine you're familiar
392;00:34:30,891;00:34:32,942;with the procedure.
393;00:34:32,977;00:34:36,062;Of course, but how did you...
394;00:34:36,097;00:34:37,102;find it?
395;00:34:37,222;00:34:39,983;You disgraced yourself at dinner
396;00:34:40,017;00:34:42,352;parading that creature
396;00:34:40,017;00:34:42,352;before the Stark girl.
397;00:34:42,403;00:34:44,988;And if it's a boy?
398;00:34:47,191;00:34:48,858;You're worried about
398;00:34:47,191;00:34:48,858;your position.
399;00:34:48,909;00:34:50,994;My position is quite clear.
400;00:34:51,028;00:34:53,830;I'm your son
401;00:34:53,864;00:34:56,366;until a better
401;00:34:53,864;00:34:56,366;alternative comes along.
402;00:35:05,626;00:35:07,794;You've never asked me
402;00:35:05,626;00:35:07,794;about your mother.
403;00:35:12,299;00:35:14,717;Why would I?
404;00:35:14,719;00:35:17,554;She had me, she died.
405;00:35:18,722;00:35:21,409;And here we are.
406;00:35:21,529;00:35:23,766;She was a peasant girl.
407;00:35:24,175;00:35:26,602;Pretty in a common sort of way.
408;00:35:26,604;00:35:28,845;She was the miller's wife.
409;00:35:28,965;00:35:32,322;Apparently they had married
409;00:35:28,965;00:35:32,322;without my knowledge or consent.
410;00:35:32,596;00:35:34,304;So I had him hanged
411;00:35:34,424;00:35:37,863;and I took her beneath the
411;00:35:34,424;00:35:37,863;tree where he was swaying.
412;00:35:37,914;00:35:39,373;She fought me the whole time.
413;00:35:39,493;00:35:42,167;She was lucky
413;00:35:39,493;00:35:42,167;I didn't hang her, too.
414;00:35:42,202;00:35:44,364;A year later
414;00:35:42,202;00:35:44,364;she came to my gates
415;00:35:44,484;00:35:46,346;with a squalling baby
415;00:35:44,484;00:35:46,346;in her arms.
416;00:35:46,466;00:35:49,041;A baby she claimed was mine.
417;00:35:49,092;00:35:50,685;I nearly had her whipped
418;00:35:50,805;00:35:53,212;and the child
418;00:35:50,805;00:35:53,212;thrown in the river.
419;00:35:58,261;00:36:00,102;But then I looked at you
420;00:36:00,136;00:36:03,072;and I saw then what I see now.
421;00:36:03,106;00:36:05,307;You are my son.
422;00:36:17,155;00:36:20,141;Stannis Baratheon has
422;00:36:17,155;00:36:20,141;an army at Castle Black.
423;00:36:20,599;00:36:23,384;But he won't stay for long.
424;00:36:23,386;00:36:26,053;He wants the Iron Throne,
425;00:36:26,055;00:36:29,546;and the road to King's Landing
425;00:36:26,055;00:36:29,546;comes right through Winterfell.
426;00:36:30,552;00:36:33,583;He means to take the North.
427;00:36:35,252;00:36:37,470;But the North is ours.
428;00:36:37,505;00:36:39,639;It's yours and mine.
429;00:36:40,641;00:36:43,259;Will you help me defeat him?
430;00:36:44,762;00:36:46,596;Yes.
431;00:36:54,322;00:36:56,773;Is this every book there is?
432;00:36:57,942;00:36:59,693;Every book there is?
433;00:37:00,828;00:37:03,913;In the world.
433;00:37:00,828;00:37:03,913;Well, no.
434;00:37:03,948;00:37:07,951;There are thousands and
434;00:37:03,948;00:37:07,951;thousands of books out there.
435;00:37:07,953;00:37:10,203;This library is rather
435;00:37:07,953;00:37:10,203;small, actually.
436;00:37:10,254;00:37:11,921;Where you grew up,
436;00:37:10,254;00:37:11,921;were there more books?
437;00:37:11,956;00:37:14,791;My father's not
437;00:37:11,956;00:37:14,791;the most literate man.
438;00:37:17,161;00:37:20,797;They say the Citadel has the
438;00:37:17,161;00:37:20,797;largest library in the world.
439;00:37:20,799;00:37:22,265;Where's that?
440;00:37:23,434;00:37:25,952;The Citadel?
441;00:37:25,986;00:37:27,721;In Oldtown.
442;00:37:34,170;00:37:35,829;I'm sorry I don't know things.
443;00:37:35,949;00:37:39,034;Gilly, look at me.
444;00:37:39,069;00:37:42,988;You know how to do a hundred
444;00:37:39,069;00:37:42,988;things I can never do.
445;00:37:43,039;00:37:45,291;You can build a fire
445;00:37:43,039;00:37:45,291;with wet wood.
446;00:37:45,325;00:37:47,743;You can cook.
446;00:37:45,325;00:37:47,743;You can stitch a wound.
447;00:37:47,794;00:37:50,496;I can wash the linens.
447;00:37:47,794;00:37:50,496;I can sweep the floor.
448;00:37:50,547;00:37:53,883;Well... - Why does the Citadel have
448;00:37:50,547;00:37:53,883;the biggest library?
449;00:37:53,917;00:37:57,052;It's where they train
449;00:37:53,917;00:37:57,052;the maesters.
450;00:37:57,087;00:37:58,621;Like Maester Aemon?
451;00:37:58,655;00:38:01,423;I wanted to be one
451;00:37:58,655;00:38:01,423;when I was young.
452;00:38:03,977;00:38:08,230;Instead, I became a man
452;00:38:03,977;00:38:08,230;of the Night's Watch.
453;00:38:10,771;00:38:13,636;Far more adventure
453;00:38:10,771;00:38:13,636;up here anyway.
454;00:38:15,190;00:38:17,323;I wouldn't have met you.
455;00:38:22,432;00:38:25,114;Ah, Your Grace.
456;00:38:32,539;00:38:34,790;You're Samwell Tarly?
457;00:38:34,792;00:38:37,893;I am, Your Grace.
458;00:38:37,928;00:38:40,212;Your father is Randyll Tarly.
459;00:38:42,799;00:38:45,801;He defeated my brother
459;00:38:42,799;00:38:45,801;at the Battle of Ashford.
460;00:38:47,053;00:38:50,022;Only battle Robert ever lost.
461;00:38:50,056;00:38:53,642;I told him he shouldn't go so far
461;00:38:50,056;00:38:53,642;west so soon, but he never listened.
462;00:38:55,999;00:38:58,864;Fine soldier, your father.
463;00:38:58,898;00:39:00,983;You don't look like a soldier.
464;00:39:02,202;00:39:04,987;But I'm told you killed
464;00:39:02,202;00:39:04,987;a white walker.
465;00:39:04,989;00:39:06,822;I did, Your Grace.
466;00:39:06,873;00:39:08,123;How?
467;00:39:08,158;00:39:10,292;With a dagger
467;00:39:08,158;00:39:10,292;made of dragonglass.
468;00:39:10,327;00:39:11,320;Dragonglass?
469;00:39:11,544;00:39:13,162;What the maesters call obsidian.
470;00:39:13,213;00:39:15,497;I know what it is.
470;00:39:13,213;00:39:15,497;We have it in Dragonstone.
471;00:39:15,548;00:39:17,112;Why would obsidian
471;00:39:15,548;00:39:17,112;kill a walker?
472;00:39:17,232;00:39:19,251;I don't know.
473;00:39:19,302;00:39:21,143;I've been going through
473;00:39:19,302;00:39:21,143;all the old manuscripts
474;00:39:21,171;00:39:23,422;hoping to find something,
474;00:39:21,171;00:39:23,422;and all I've learned
475;00:39:23,473;00:39:26,377;is that the children of the forest
475;00:39:23,473;00:39:26,377;used to hunt with dragonglass.
476;00:39:26,497;00:39:30,646;The Lady Melisandre told me
476;00:39:26,497;00:39:30,646;that death marches on the Wall.
477;00:39:33,600;00:39:35,209;I've seen it, Your Grace.
478;00:39:35,329;00:39:37,186;Seen what?
479;00:39:37,188;00:39:40,089;The army of the dead.
480;00:39:40,123;00:39:43,792;And when they come--
480;00:39:40,123;00:39:43,792;We have to know how to fight them.
481;00:39:47,564;00:39:50,115;Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.
482;00:40:07,467;00:40:09,268;It's time.
483;00:40:09,302;00:40:11,553;Uh, Your Grace.
484;00:40:11,604;00:40:14,106;Wouldn't it be better to wait?
485;00:40:14,140;00:40:16,987;When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings,
485;00:40:14,140;00:40:16,987;we could have thousands more men.
486;00:40:17,058;00:40:18,578;If Jon Snow returns
486;00:40:17,058;00:40:18,578;with the wildlings.
487;00:40:18,591;00:40:20,275;We can't wait that long.
488;00:40:20,310;00:40:23,896;We have the advantage-- more men,
488;00:40:20,310;00:40:23,896;more horses, all fed and rested.
489;00:40:23,898;00:40:26,899;But every day we wait, the
489;00:40:23,898;00:40:26,899;odds shift in Bolton's favor.
490;00:40:26,950;00:40:29,034;This could turn to winter
490;00:40:26,950;00:40:29,034;at any moment.
491;00:40:29,069;00:40:30,869;We have to act now.
491;00:40:29,069;00:40:30,869;Give the order.
492;00:40:30,904;00:40:32,404;We march at sunrise.
493;00:40:32,406;00:40:34,156;I'll choose a dozen men to stay
494;00:40:34,207;00:40:36,625;and guard the queen
494;00:40:34,207;00:40:36,625;and the princess.
495;00:40:36,659;00:40:38,539;No need.
495;00:40:36,659;00:40:38,539;They're coming with us.
496;00:40:40,246;00:40:42,247;It's a tough road ahead,
496;00:40:40,246;00:40:42,247;Your Grace.
497;00:40:42,298;00:40:45,050;Won't they be safer--
497;00:40:42,298;00:40:45,050;Here?
498;00:40:45,085;00:40:48,754;Half these watchmen
498;00:40:45,085;00:40:48,754;are killers and rapists.
499;00:40:49,839;00:40:51,724;No, they march with us.
500;00:40:54,894;00:40:56,895;As you wish, Your Grace.
501;00:41:22,422;00:41:25,124;Do you think Father will
501;00:41:22,422;00:41:25,124;let me go down into the crypt?
502;00:41:25,126;00:41:26,766;Beg your pardon?
503;00:41:26,793;00:41:28,544;At Winterfell.
504;00:41:28,595;00:41:30,629;All the Kings in the North
504;00:41:28,595;00:41:30,629;are buried there.
505;00:41:30,631;00:41:32,464;Bran the Builder
505;00:41:30,631;00:41:32,464;and King Dorren and--
506;00:41:32,466;00:41:34,850;First things first.
506;00:41:32,466;00:41:34,850;It's a long march ahead.
507;00:41:34,884;00:41:36,852;And then we have
507;00:41:34,884;00:41:36,852;to take the castle.
508;00:41:36,886;00:41:38,303;Is there going to be a battle?
509;00:41:38,354;00:41:40,806;Aye, princess, but you
509;00:41:38,354;00:41:40,806;won't be anywhere near--
510;00:41:40,857;00:41:44,059;That's enough talk
510;00:41:40,857;00:41:44,059;of battle, Ser Davos.
511;00:41:44,110;00:41:45,527;You'll scare the child.
512;00:41:45,562;00:41:47,980;Yes, my queen.
513;00:41:50,366;00:41:53,318;I'm not scared.
513;00:41:50,366;00:41:53,318;Well, I am.
514;00:41:53,403;00:41:56,321;When the battle comes,
514;00:41:53,403;00:41:56,321;promise you'll protect me.
515;00:41:56,406;00:41:58,457;I promise.
516;00:42:18,261;00:42:21,680;I hope you know what you're
516;00:42:18,261;00:42:21,680;doing with these wildlings.
517;00:42:21,731;00:42:24,099;I need those ships.
518;00:42:25,151;00:42:28,320;You'll get them back,
518;00:42:25,151;00:42:28,320;I swear it.
519;00:42:29,856;00:42:32,191;Have a safe journey, Your Grace.
520;00:42:33,193;00:42:35,027;And thank you.
521;00:43:03,857;00:43:05,691;Mount up!
522;00:43:05,725;00:43:07,726;Colors!
523;00:43:57,277;00:43:59,278;No.
524;00:43:59,280;00:44:01,246;You're still too weak.
525;00:44:01,281;00:44:05,784;
526;00:44:06,479;00:44:07,850;
527;00:44:12,258;00:44:13,759;Ser Barristan?
528;00:44:19,677;00:44:20,873;
529;00:44:24,923;00:44:26,730;
530;00:44:27,776;00:44:29,446;
531;00:44:29,566;00:44:31,173;
532;00:44:31,983;00:44:33,628;
533;00:44:35,248;00:44:37,129;
534;00:44:39,552;00:44:41,787;Are you ashamed?
535;00:44:43,323;00:44:45,824;You were ambushed, outnumbered.
536;00:44:45,875;00:44:47,793;There was no way
536;00:44:45,875;00:44:47,793;you could have known.
537;00:44:47,827;00:44:49,878;This is not why.
538;00:44:52,332;00:44:54,549;Wounded in war,
539;00:44:54,584;00:44:57,919;there is no shame for this.
540;00:44:57,971;00:45:00,088;I am ashamed
541;00:45:00,139;00:45:02,674;because when the knife go in
542;00:45:02,725;00:45:06,061;and I fall to the ground,
543;00:45:06,095;00:45:08,013;I am afraid.
544;00:45:09,565;00:45:11,650;All men fear death.
545;00:45:11,684;00:45:14,469;No, not death.
546;00:45:17,023;00:45:19,691;I fear
547;00:45:19,742;00:45:24,656;I never again see Missandei
547;00:45:19,742;00:45:24,656;from the Island of Naath.
548;00:46:00,616;00:46:03,785;Now you have given the
548;00:46:00,616;00:46:03,785;Masters what they deserve.
549;00:46:03,820;00:46:05,370;If I give everyone
549;00:46:03,820;00:46:05,370;what they deserve,
550;00:46:05,405;00:46:07,572;I'll have no one left to rule.
551;00:46:07,574;00:46:10,125;Ser Barristan counseled mercy
552;00:46:10,159;00:46:12,840;when I took this city right
552;00:46:10,159;00:46:12,840;up to the morning he died.
553;00:46:12,879;00:46:15,664;Daario Naharis thinks I should
553;00:46:12,879;00:46:15,664;kill the former Masters
554;00:46:15,715;00:46:18,876;and let the rest of the
554;00:46:15,715;00:46:18,876;city fend for itself.
555;00:46:19,335;00:46:21,086;What do you think?
556;00:46:22,555;00:46:24,673;Your Grace, I think
556;00:46:22,555;00:46:24,673;that I am not fit
557;00:46:24,724;00:46:27,092;to have an opinion
557;00:46:24,724;00:46:27,092;on these matters.
558;00:46:27,143;00:46:29,594;You are as fit as anyone I know.
559;00:46:31,013;00:46:33,265;You know why I'm here.
560;00:46:33,267;00:46:36,351;And you know who will suffer the
560;00:46:33,267;00:46:36,351;most if this all falls apart.
561;00:46:36,402;00:46:39,571;So what do you think?
562;00:46:41,774;00:46:45,277;I can only tell you
562;00:46:41,774;00:46:45,277;what I have seen, Your Grace.
563;00:46:45,328;00:46:48,613;I have seen you listen
563;00:46:45,328;00:46:48,613;to your counselors.
564;00:46:50,333;00:46:53,952;I have seen you lean on their
564;00:46:50,333;00:46:53,952;experience when your own was lacking
565;00:46:54,003;00:46:57,055;and weigh the choices
565;00:46:54,003;00:46:57,055;they put before you.
566;00:46:58,758;00:47:01,760;And I have seen you
566;00:46:58,758;00:47:01,760;ignore your counselors...
567;00:47:04,630;00:47:07,132;because there was
567;00:47:04,630;00:47:07,132;a better choice.
568;00:47:07,166;00:47:09,518;One that only you could see.
569;00:47:26,235;00:47:29,488;My-- my queen,
569;00:47:26,235;00:47:29,488;please do not do this.
570;00:47:29,490;00:47:31,490;What about valar morghulis?
571;00:47:31,492;00:47:34,075;I did not want to die a coward.
572;00:47:38,831;00:47:41,466;Apparently I do not
572;00:47:38,831;00:47:41,466;want to die at all.
573;00:47:43,336;00:47:45,804;It takes courage to admit fear.
574;00:47:47,173;00:47:49,508;And to admit a mistake.
575;00:47:50,977;00:47:53,595;I came here to tell you
575;00:47:50,977;00:47:53,595;that I was wrong.
576;00:47:56,482;00:47:59,100;I was wrong and you were right.
577;00:48:01,070;00:48:03,188;About tradition.
578;00:48:04,607;00:48:07,442;About bringing the people
578;00:48:04,607;00:48:07,442;of this city together.
579;00:48:10,830;00:48:13,031;I will reopen the fighting pits.
580;00:48:14,000;00:48:15,584;To free men only.
581;00:48:15,618;00:48:19,838;Slavery will never return to
581;00:48:15,618;00:48:19,838;Meereen, not while I live.
582;00:48:19,872;00:48:21,957;Yes, my queen.
583;00:48:25,344;00:48:29,297;And in order to forge a lasting
583;00:48:25,344;00:48:29,297;bond with the Meereenese people,
584;00:48:29,348;00:48:32,133;I will marry the leader
584;00:48:29,348;00:48:32,133;of an ancient family.
585;00:48:34,387;00:48:37,389;Thankfully a suitor
585;00:48:34,387;00:48:37,389;is already on his knees.
586;00:49:05,551;00:49:07,335;Don't worry.
587;00:49:07,386;00:49:10,839;I'll be fine. Nothing
587;00:49:07,386;00:49:10,839;broken, I don't think.
588;00:49:13,009;00:49:14,809;Where are we now?
589;00:49:14,844;00:49:16,928;Not the Rhoyne.
590;00:49:22,985;00:49:25,654;Long, sullen silences
591;00:49:25,688;00:49:28,690;and an occasional
591;00:49:25,688;00:49:28,690;punch in the face.
592;00:49:30,493;00:49:32,611;The Mormont way.
593;00:49:36,082;00:49:38,833;Let's start over.
594;00:49:40,036;00:49:42,454;I apologize for before.
595;00:49:42,456;00:49:45,457;My mouth sometimes
595;00:49:42,456;00:49:45,457;runs away from me.
596;00:49:45,508;00:49:48,426;This doesn't have to be
596;00:49:45,508;00:49:48,426;an unpleasant trip.
597;00:49:53,215;00:49:56,376;We're going to be spending a lot of
597;00:49:53,215;00:49:56,376;time together on the way to Meereen.
598;00:49:56,385;00:49:57,769;We are.
599;00:49:59,605;00:50:02,941;What would make our time
599;00:49:59,605;00:50:02,941;together truly enjoyable
600;00:50:02,975;00:50:04,476;would be some wine.
601;00:50:05,311;00:50:06,811;No wine.
602;00:50:09,482;00:50:12,984;I am a person who drinks.
603;00:50:14,654;00:50:16,988;People who drink
603;00:50:14,654;00:50:16,988;need to keep drinking.
604;00:50:17,039;00:50:19,074;Otherwise, they're not...
605;00:50:26,499;00:50:27,999;I know where we are.
606;00:50:28,050;00:50:30,552;You're taking us
606;00:50:28,050;00:50:30,552;through Valyria.
607;00:50:30,586;00:50:31,970;I am.
608;00:50:32,004;00:50:34,172;Have you sailed
608;00:50:32,004;00:50:34,172;this route before?
609;00:50:34,223;00:50:35,757;No.
610;00:50:35,808;00:50:37,759;You're going to bring
610;00:50:35,808;00:50:37,759;Daenerys a souvenir
611;00:50:37,810;00:50:40,011;from her ancestral homeland
611;00:50:37,810;00:50:40,011;in case I'm not enough?
612;00:50:40,013;00:50:42,597;I think you'll be plenty.
613;00:50:43,733;00:50:45,817;You know what they say.
614;00:50:45,851;00:50:49,070;The Doom still rules Valyria.
615;00:50:49,105;00:50:52,023;What about the demons
615;00:50:49,105;00:50:52,023;and the flames?
616;00:50:53,192;00:50:54,909;Aren't you afraid of the Doom?
617;00:50:54,944;00:50:56,745;No.
618;00:50:56,779;00:50:59,197;But pirates are.
619;00:51:00,082;00:51:01,700;Oh.
620;00:51:04,620;00:51:08,173;The Smoking Sea.
621;00:51:08,207;00:51:10,175;How many centuries
621;00:51:08,207;00:51:10,175;before we learn
622;00:51:10,209;00:51:12,593;how to build cities
622;00:51:10,209;00:51:12,593;like this again?
623;00:51:13,828;00:51:16,630;Thousands of years the Valyrians were
624;00:51:16,664;00:51:19,473;the best in the world
624;00:51:16,664;00:51:19,473;at almost everything.
625;00:51:19,971;00:51:22,469;And then...
626;00:51:22,503;00:51:25,255;And then they weren't.
627;00:51:25,306;00:51:26,923;And then they weren't.
628;00:51:30,178;00:51:34,347;They held each other close and
628;00:51:30,178;00:51:34,347;turned their backs upon the end.
629;00:51:34,399;00:51:37,401;The hills that split asunder
630;00:51:37,435;00:51:40,237;and the black
630;00:51:37,435;00:51:40,237;"that ate the skies;"
631;00:51:40,271;00:51:41,968;The flames that shot
631;00:51:40,271;00:51:41,968;so high and hot
632;00:51:42,088;00:51:44,191;"that even dragons burned;"
633;00:51:44,242;00:51:46,018;Would never be the final sights
634;00:51:46,138;00:51:48,779;that fell upon their eyes.
635;00:51:49,220;00:51:50,931;A fly upon a wall,
636;00:51:51,517;00:51:55,487;the waves the sea wind
636;00:51:51,517;00:51:55,487;whipped and churned--
637;00:51:55,521;00:51:58,440;The city of a thousand years,
638;00:51:58,442;00:52:00,358;"and all that men had learned;"
639;00:52:00,409;00:52:03,862;The Doom consumed it all alike,
640;00:52:03,913;00:52:06,614;and neither
640;00:52:03,913;00:52:06,614;of them turned.
641;00:52:08,918;00:52:11,703;I would clap.
642;00:52:16,759;00:52:19,127;I suppose this is it, then.
643;00:52:20,296;00:52:22,430;This is what remains.
644;00:53:02,087;00:53:03,338;What was that?
645;00:53:09,895;00:53:12,263;Stone Men!
646;00:53:12,314;00:53:14,215;Don't let them touch you!
647;00:53:30,499;00:53:32,200;Get behind!
648;00:53:34,587;00:53:37,172;Mormont, cut me free!
649;00:53:37,206;00:53:39,374;Mormont!
650;00:53:54,139;00:53:56,057;Mormont!
651;00:53:56,059;00:53:58,193;Mormont!
652;00:54:33,745;00:54:35,796;Tyrion?
653;00:54:38,633;00:54:41,135;Tyrion.
654;00:54:41,169;00:54:42,837;Tyrion.
655;00:54:44,256;00:54:46,257;Tyrion.
656;00:54:47,182;00:54:49,560;You're all right.
657;00:54:59,104;00:55:01,439;You're heavier than you look.
658;00:55:03,942;00:55:06,277;Did any of them touch you?
659;00:55:09,031;00:55:10,948;You?
660;00:55:15,921;00:55:18,839;I've seen greyscale before,
661;00:55:18,874;00:55:20,341;but nothing like that.
662;00:55:20,375;00:55:23,294;I suppose that's why
662;00:55:20,375;00:55:23,294;they send them there.
663;00:55:25,297;00:55:28,817;It'd be kinder to put daggers in
663;00:55:25,297;00:55:28,817;their hearts and be done with it.
664;00:55:32,721;00:55:35,973;Thank you for saving me.
665;00:55:39,311;00:55:41,479;Of course, I wouldn't
665;00:55:39,311;00:55:41,479;have needed saving
666;00:55:41,481;00:55:43,762;if you hadn't kidnapped me
666;00:55:41,481;00:55:43,762;in the first place.
667;00:55:47,851;00:55:49,670;So what now?
668;00:55:49,777;00:55:51,861;We walk up the coast.
669;00:55:51,912;00:55:53,747;With luck, we'll find
669;00:55:51,912;00:55:53,747;a fishing village.
670;00:55:53,781;00:55:55,782;Maybe another boat.
671;00:55:55,784;00:55:58,068;Without luck?
672;00:55:58,102;00:56:00,787;We've got a long walk
672;00:55:58,102;00:56:00,787;ahead of us.
673;00:56:02,707;00:56:05,842;I'll get some wood for a fire.
674;00:56:05,876;00:56:08,628;Try to get some rest, huh?
675;00:56:08,679;00:56:11,414;That's the best idea
675;00:56:08,679;00:56:11,414;you've had all day.
676;00:56:59,721;00:57:09,964;
676;00:56:59,721;00:57:09,964;9999
676;00:56:59,721;00:57:09,964;00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
