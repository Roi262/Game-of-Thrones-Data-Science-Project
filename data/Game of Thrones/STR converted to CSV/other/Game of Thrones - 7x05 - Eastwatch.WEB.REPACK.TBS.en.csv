1;00:00:04,275;00:00:06,234;Clegane, look into the flames.
2;00:00:06,484;00:00:07,775;What do you see?
3;00:00:07,776;00:00:09,567;A wall of ice.
4;00:00:10,651;00:00:11,983;The Wall.
5;00:00:13,609;00:00:15,274;The only thing standing
5;00:00:13,609;00:00:15,274;between us
6;00:00:15,275;00:00:16,941;and the army of the dead
6;00:00:15,275;00:00:16,941;is the Wall,
7;00:00:16,942;00:00:19,734;and the Wall hasn't been
7;00:00:16,942;00:00:19,734;properly manned in centuries.
8;00:00:20,067;00:00:21,525;Last time we saw The Night King,
9;00:00:21,526;00:00:22,567;it was at Hardhome.
10;00:00:22,983;00:00:25,816;Closest castle to Hardhome
10;00:00:22,983;00:00:25,816;is Eastwatch by the sea.
11;00:00:25,817;00:00:27,577;And that's where I'll go.
12;00:00:27,858;00:00:30,400;Looks like we're
12;00:00:27,858;00:00:30,400;the Nightswatch now.
13;00:00:33,942;00:00:36,776;This suits you, Lady Stark.
14;00:00:37,734;00:00:40,192;Jon left you in charge?
14;00:00:37,734;00:00:40,192;He did.
15;00:00:50,359;00:00:53,234;Lord Tarly.
15;00:00:50,359;00:00:53,234;I believe you know my son.
16;00:00:53,442;00:00:54,900;Do you fight with us...
17;00:00:55,692;00:00:57,858;or with the foreign savages
17;00:00:55,692;00:00:57,858;and eunuchs?
18;00:00:59,484;00:01:01,233;What do you think I should do?
19;00:01:01,234;00:01:03,983;If you use them to melt castles
19;00:01:01,234;00:01:03,983;and burn cities,
20;00:01:04,317;00:01:05,400;you're not different.
21;00:01:05,817;00:01:07,484;You're just more of the same.
22;00:01:09,317;00:01:10,651;Listen.

25;00:03:57,484;00:03:59,483;back there?
26;00:03:59,484;00:04:01,775;Ending the war.
27;00:04:01,776;00:04:03,982;Killing her.
28;00:04:03,983;00:04:06,400;You saw the dragon
28;00:04:03,983;00:04:06,400;between you and her?
29;00:04:09,526;00:04:12,400;And?
30;00:04:19,150;00:04:20,982;Listen to me, cunt.
31;00:04:20,983;00:04:22,525;Till I get what I'm owed,
32;00:04:22,526;00:04:24,358;a dragon doesn't

33;00:04:24,359;00:04:26,233;you don't get to kill you,
34;00:04:26,234;00:04:27,692;only I get to kill you.
35;00:04:30,817;00:04:33,691;That was only one of them.
36;00:04:33,692;00:04:36,525;She has two more.
37;00:04:36,526;00:04:39,608;If she decides to use them,
37;00:04:36,526;00:04:39,608;to really use them...
38;00:04:39,609;00:04:42,233;You're fucked.
38;00:04:39,609;00:04:42,233;Don't you mean we're fucked?
39;00:04:42,234;00:04:44,233;No, I do not.
40;00:04:44,234;00:04:47,399;Dragons are where
40;00:04:44,234;00:04:47,399;our partnership ends.
41;00:04:47,400;00:04:49,024;I'm not gonna be around
41;00:04:47,400;00:04:49,024;when those things
42;00:04:49,025;00:04:50,776;start spitting fire
42;00:04:49,025;00:04:50,776;on King's Landing.
43;00:04:52,817;00:04:54,275;I have to tell Cersei.
44;00:04:57,108;00:04:59,067;May as well jump
44;00:04:57,108;00:04:59,067;back in that river.
45;00:06:13,442;00:06:16,399;I know what Cersei has told you.
46;00:06:16,400;00:06:21,149;That I've come
46;00:06:16,400;00:06:21,149;to destroy your cities,
47;00:06:21,150;00:06:22,399;burn down your homes,
48;00:06:22,400;00:06:24,150;murder you,
48;00:06:22,400;00:06:24,150;and orphan your children.
49;00:06:26,983;00:06:30,775;That's Cersei Lannister, not me.
50;00:06:30,776;00:06:32,982;I'm not here to murder,
51;00:06:32,983;00:06:34,733;and all I want to destroy
52;00:06:34,734;00:06:37,816;is the wheel that has
52;00:06:34,734;00:06:37,816;rolled over rich and poor
53;00:06:37,817;00:06:42,025;to the benefit of no one but the
53;00:06:37,817;00:06:42,025;Cersei Lannisters of the world.
54;00:06:43,234;00:06:45,483;I offer you a choice--
55;00:06:45,484;00:06:47,816;bend the knee and join me.
56;00:06:47,817;00:06:51,982;Together, we will leave the world
56;00:06:47,817;00:06:51,982;a better place than we found it.
57;00:06:51,983;00:06:54,982;Or refuse...
58;00:06:54,983;00:06:56,484;and die.
59;00:07:25,484;00:07:27,025;Step forward, my lord.
60;00:07:36,192;00:07:38,149;You will not kneel?
61;00:07:38,150;00:07:39,526;I already have a queen.
62;00:07:40,734;00:07:42,233;My sister.
63;00:07:42,234;00:07:43,441;She wasn't your queen
64;00:07:43,442;00:07:45,483;until recently, though, was she?
65;00:07:45,484;00:07:47,816;When she murdered
65;00:07:45,484;00:07:47,816;your rightful queen
66;00:07:47,817;00:07:50,441;and destroyed House Tyrell
66;00:07:47,817;00:07:50,441;for all time.
67;00:07:50,442;00:07:53,734;So it appears your allegiances
67;00:07:50,442;00:07:53,734;are somewhat flexible.
68;00:07:54,858;00:07:57,775;There are
68;00:07:54,858;00:07:57,775;no easy choices in war.
69;00:07:57,776;00:08:00,149;Say what you will
69;00:07:57,776;00:08:00,149;about your sister,
70;00:08:00,150;00:08:02,650;she was born in Westeros.
71;00:08:02,651;00:08:04,900;She's lived here all her life.
72;00:08:06,900;00:08:09,733;You, on the other hand,
73;00:08:09,734;00:08:12,483;murdered your own father
74;00:08:12,484;00:08:15,608;and chose to support
74;00:08:12,484;00:08:15,608;a foreign invader.
75;00:08:15,609;00:08:18,442;One with no ties to this land...
76;00:08:20,067;00:08:22,442;with an army of savages
76;00:08:20,067;00:08:22,442;at her back.
77;00:08:24,275;00:08:26,108;You will not trade
77;00:08:24,275;00:08:26,108;your honor for your life.
78;00:08:28,108;00:08:29,566;I respect that.
79;00:08:29,567;00:08:32,608;Perhaps he could take
79;00:08:29,567;00:08:32,608;the Black, Your Grace.
80;00:08:32,609;00:08:35,024;Whatever else he is,
80;00:08:32,609;00:08:35,024;he is a true soldier.
81;00:08:35,025;00:08:37,274;He'd be invaluable at the Wall.
82;00:08:37,275;00:08:39,609;You cannot send me to the Wall.
83;00:08:40,983;00:08:42,609;You are not my queen.
84;00:08:56,067;00:08:57,399;You will have to kill me, too.
85;00:08:57,400;00:08:59,275;Step back and shut your mouth.
86;00:09:00,817;00:09:02,233;Who are you?
87;00:09:02,234;00:09:03,484;A stupid boy.
88;00:09:04,609;00:09:06,816;I am Dickon Tarly,
89;00:09:06,817;00:09:08,233;son of Randyll Tarly.
90;00:09:08,234;00:09:10,441;You are the future
90;00:09:08,234;00:09:10,441;of your house.
91;00:09:10,442;00:09:13,816;This war has already wiped one
91;00:09:10,442;00:09:13,816;great house from the world.
92;00:09:13,817;00:09:15,692;Don't let it happen again.
92;00:09:13,817;00:09:15,692;Bend the knee.
93;00:09:23,359;00:09:24,817;I will not.
94;00:09:29,150;00:09:32,857;Your Grace, nothing scrubs
94;00:09:29,150;00:09:32,857;bold notions from a man's head
95;00:09:32,858;00:09:34,441;like a few weeks in a dark cell.
96;00:09:34,442;00:09:37,107;I meant what I said.
97;00:09:37,108;00:09:38,650;I'm not here
97;00:09:37,108;00:09:38,650;to put men in chains.
98;00:09:38,651;00:09:40,982;If that becomes an option,
98;00:09:38,651;00:09:40,982;many will take it.
99;00:09:40,983;00:09:42,359;I gave them a choice.
100;00:09:43,858;00:09:45,191;They made it.
101;00:09:45,192;00:09:48,358;Your Grace, if you start
101;00:09:45,192;00:09:48,358;beheading entire families--
102;00:09:48,359;00:09:50,526;I'm not beheading anyone.
103;00:09:55,900;00:09:57,359;Your Grace.
104;00:10:21,692;00:10:25,233;Lord Randyll
104;00:10:21,692;00:10:25,233;Tarly, Dickon Tarly,
105;00:10:25,234;00:10:27,899;I, Daenerys of House
105;00:10:25,234;00:10:27,899;Targaryen, First of My Name,
106;00:10:27,900;00:10:31,024;Breaker of Chains,
106;00:10:27,900;00:10:31,024;and Mother of Dragons,
107;00:10:31,025;00:10:32,858;sentence you to die.
108;00:10:36,442;00:10:37,609;Dracarys.
109;00:11:25,609;00:11:27,150;My-- my lord...
110;00:11:37,067;00:11:38,651;How many men did we lose?
111;00:11:41,234;00:11:43,275;We haven't done
111;00:11:41,234;00:11:43,275;a full accounting.
112;00:11:44,983;00:11:48,441;It's not only armies
112;00:11:44,983;00:11:48,441;that win wars.
113;00:11:48,442;00:11:50,941;We have the Tyrell gold, we
113;00:11:48,442;00:11:50,941;have the Iron Bank behind us.
114;00:11:50,942;00:11:52,609;We can buy mercenaries.
115;00:11:54,526;00:11:56,399;Not the same as our men,
115;00:11:54,526;00:11:56,399;but they'll fight
116;00:11:56,400;00:11:58,608;if they're well paid,
116;00:11:56,400;00:11:58,608;which they will be.
117;00:11:58,609;00:12:02,066;I just saw the Dothraki fight.
118;00:12:02,067;00:12:03,691;They'll beat any mercenary army.
119;00:12:03,692;00:12:05,775;They'll beat any army
119;00:12:03,692;00:12:05,775;I've ever seen.
120;00:12:05,776;00:12:08,650;Killing our men wasn't war
120;00:12:05,776;00:12:08,650;for them, it was sport.
121;00:12:08,651;00:12:10,857;Her dragon burnt
121;00:12:08,651;00:12:10,857;a thousand wagons.
122;00:12:10,858;00:12:13,107;Qyburn's scorpion fired
122;00:12:10,858;00:12:13,107;bolts bigger than you.
123;00:12:13,108;00:12:15,651;They couldn't stop it.
123;00:12:13,108;00:12:15,651;And she has three of them.
124;00:12:17,692;00:12:19,608;This isn't a war we can win.
125;00:12:19,609;00:12:20,983;So, what do we do?
126;00:12:22,400;00:12:23,651;Sue for peace?
127;00:12:24,983;00:12:26,566;I sit on her father's throne,
128;00:12:26,567;00:12:29,233;the father you betrayed
128;00:12:26,567;00:12:29,233;and murdered.
129;00:12:29,234;00:12:32,066;And in her mind, she's winning.
130;00:12:32,067;00:12:34,150;What sort of offer
130;00:12:32,067;00:12:34,150;do you think she'd make?
131;00:12:36,609;00:12:40,024;Maybe we can count on Tyrion
131;00:12:36,609;00:12:40,024;to intercede on our behalf
132;00:12:40,025;00:12:42,400;by way of apology for
132;00:12:40,025;00:12:42,400;murdering our father and son.
133;00:12:44,150;00:12:45,650;He didn't.
134;00:12:45,651;00:12:47,650;You saw the crossbow,
134;00:12:45,651;00:12:47,650;you saw his body.
135;00:12:47,651;00:12:49,525;I'm not talking about Father.
136;00:12:49,526;00:12:53,066;Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.
136;00:12:49,526;00:12:53,066;He had nothing to do with it.
137;00:12:53,067;00:12:56,359;After all this time, it still amazes me that you--
137;00:12:53,067;00:12:56,359;It was Olenna.
138;00:12:58,734;00:13:01,067;She confessed before she died.
139;00:13:03,359;00:13:05,608;And this was before or after
140;00:13:05,609;00:13:08,691;she drank the poison
140;00:13:05,609;00:13:08,691;you so kindly provided her?
141;00:13:08,692;00:13:10,316;After.
142;00:13:10,317;00:13:11,816;And you believed her?
143;00:13:11,817;00:13:14,566;If you were Olenna,
143;00:13:11,817;00:13:14,566;would you rather have seen
144;00:13:14,567;00:13:17,234;your granddaughter married
144;00:13:14,567;00:13:17,234;to Joffrey or Tommen?
145;00:13:19,609;00:13:21,982;Which one would Margaery have
145;00:13:19,609;00:13:21,982;been better able to control?
146;00:13:21,983;00:13:23,525;Which one would have made Olenna
147;00:13:23,526;00:13:26,233;the true ruler
147;00:13:23,526;00:13:26,233;of the Seven Kingdoms?
148;00:13:26,234;00:13:28,108;She was telling the truth.
149;00:13:35,484;00:13:37,692;I shouldn't have
149;00:13:35,484;00:13:37,692;listened to you.
150;00:13:39,484;00:13:41,274;She should have died screaming.
151;00:13:41,275;00:13:42,566;She's dead, like her son,
152;00:13:42,567;00:13:44,650;her grandchildren,
152;00:13:42,567;00:13:44,650;her whole house.
153;00:13:44,651;00:13:48,233;And if we don't find a way out
153;00:13:44,651;00:13:48,233;of this war, we'll follow them.
154;00:13:48,234;00:13:50,775;So we fight and die
154;00:13:48,234;00:13:50,775;or we submit and die.
155;00:13:50,776;00:13:52,941;I know my choice.
156;00:13:52,942;00:13:55,442;A soldier should know his.
157;00:16:02,567;00:16:04,733;They're beautiful, aren't they?
158;00:16:04,734;00:16:07,526;It wasn't the word
158;00:16:04,734;00:16:07,526;I was thinking of, but...
159;00:16:08,776;00:16:11,525;but, yes, they are.
160;00:16:11,526;00:16:13,024;Gorgeous beasts.
161;00:16:13,025;00:16:14,941;They're not beasts to me.
162;00:16:14,942;00:16:16,775;No matter how big they get
163;00:16:16,776;00:16:18,941;or how terrifying
163;00:16:16,776;00:16:18,941;to everyone else,
164;00:16:18,942;00:16:20,567;they're my children.
165;00:16:26,234;00:16:27,566;You weren't gone long.
166;00:16:27,567;00:16:29,733;No.
167;00:16:29,734;00:16:31,733;And?
168;00:16:31,734;00:16:34,442;And I have fewer enemies
168;00:16:31,734;00:16:34,442;today than I did yesterday.
169;00:16:37,108;00:16:39,191;You're not sure
169;00:16:37,108;00:16:39,191;how you feel about that.
170;00:16:39,192;00:16:40,900;No, I'm not.
171;00:16:42,817;00:16:44,274;How many men did your army kill
172;00:16:44,275;00:16:46,275;taking Winterfell back
172;00:16:44,275;00:16:46,275;from the Boltons?
173;00:16:47,442;00:16:48,816;Thousands.
174;00:16:48,817;00:16:50,941;We both want to help people.
175;00:16:50,942;00:16:54,650;We can only help them
175;00:16:50,942;00:16:54,650;from a position of strength.
176;00:16:54,651;00:16:56,734;Sometimes strength is terrible.
177;00:16:59,942;00:17:02,608;When you first came here,
178;00:17:02,609;00:17:06,358;Ser Davos said you took a knife
178;00:17:02,609;00:17:06,358;in the heart for your people.
179;00:17:06,359;00:17:07,983;Ser Davos gets carried away.
180;00:17:09,734;00:17:11,441;So, it was a figure of speech?
181;00:17:15,942;00:17:19,303;_
182;00:17:25,987;00:17:27,406;_
183;00:17:31,983;00:17:33,182;Your Grace.
184;00:17:39,025;00:17:42,399;Jon Snow, this is
184;00:17:39,025;00:17:42,399;Ser Jorah Mormont,
185;00:17:42,400;00:17:44,650;an old friend.
186;00:17:44,651;00:17:46,149;I served with your father.
187;00:17:46,150;00:17:48,317;He was a great man.
188;00:17:49,858;00:17:51,526;You look strong.
189;00:17:53,359;00:17:54,691;You found a cure?
190;00:17:54,692;00:17:56,650;I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
191;00:17:56,651;00:18:01,149;I return to your
191;00:17:56,651;00:18:01,149;service, my queen,
192;00:18:01,150;00:18:02,941;if you'll have me.
193;00:18:02,942;00:18:05,317;It would be my honor.
194;00:19:44,776;00:19:46,233;Ravens.
195;00:19:46,234;00:19:48,067;We need to send ravens.
196;00:19:50,526;00:19:53,274;I put very little stock
196;00:19:50,526;00:19:53,274;in it myself.
197;00:19:53,275;00:19:55,733;Prophecies of doom
197;00:19:53,275;00:19:55,733;are never in short supply,
198;00:19:55,734;00:19:57,941;especially when winter comes.
199;00:19:57,942;00:20:00,274;I remember Wolkan.
200;00:20:00,275;00:20:02,650;A little timid,
200;00:20:00,275;00:20:02,650;but a sharp mind.
201;00:20:02,651;00:20:06,149;Eh, the North has dulled
201;00:20:02,651;00:20:06,149;many good maesters' wits.
202;00:20:06,150;00:20:08,358;Hard to say whether
202;00:20:06,150;00:20:08,358;it's the cold, the drink,
203;00:20:08,359;00:20:10,149;or the company.
204;00:20:10,150;00:20:12,316;A crippled boy
204;00:20:10,150;00:20:12,316;claims to have seen
205;00:20:12,317;00:20:14,441;dead men on the march
205;00:20:12,317;00:20:14,441;beyond the Wall,
206;00:20:14,442;00:20:17,608;thanks to the magical help
206;00:20:14,442;00:20:17,608;of a raven with three eyes?
207;00:20:17,609;00:20:19,274;Yes, it is a bit much.
208;00:20:19,275;00:20:21,983;Still, we ought to write back--
208;00:20:19,275;00:20:21,983;Brandon Stark.
209;00:20:25,484;00:20:28,651;The crippled boy.
209;00:20:25,484;00:20:28,651;Do you know him?
210;00:20:29,817;00:20:31,982;I led him through
210;00:20:29,817;00:20:31,982;the Wall years ago.
211;00:20:31,983;00:20:35,149;I saw him go beyond the Wall.
212;00:20:35,150;00:20:36,733;And?
213;00:20:36,734;00:20:39,650;Somehow, a crippled boy
214;00:20:39,651;00:20:41,733;survived for years beyond the
214;00:20:39,651;00:20:41,733;Wall when no one else could.
215;00:20:41,734;00:20:45,484;Not the Night's Watch,
215;00:20:41,734;00:20:45,484;not the wildlings, no one.
216;00:20:47,108;00:20:49,191;Perhaps we ought to listen
216;00:20:47,108;00:20:49,191;to what he has to say.
217;00:20:49,192;00:20:52,316;Perhaps you need more scribing
217;00:20:49,192;00:20:52,316;work to discipline your mind.
218;00:20:52,317;00:20:55,734;I sense a more detailed
218;00:20:52,317;00:20:55,734;proposal is forthcoming?
219;00:21:06,359;00:21:10,358;Everyone in Westeros
219;00:21:06,359;00:21:10,358;trusts and respects you.
220;00:21:10,359;00:21:14,525;If you tell people the threat
220;00:21:10,359;00:21:14,525;is real, they'll believe it.
221;00:21:14,526;00:21:16,899;If you advise all the lords
221;00:21:14,526;00:21:16,899;to send their men north
222;00:21:16,900;00:21:18,857;to hold the Wall, they'll do it.
223;00:21:18,858;00:21:22,358;And if you tell every
223;00:21:18,858;00:21:22,358;maester in the Citadel
224;00:21:22,359;00:21:24,691;to search every word
224;00:21:22,359;00:21:24,691;of every faded scroll
225;00:21:24,692;00:21:26,483;about the Long Night,
226;00:21:26,484;00:21:28,316;they may find something
226;00:21:26,484;00:21:28,316;that lets us defeat
227;00:21:28,317;00:21:30,234;the Army of the Dead for good.
228;00:21:35,317;00:21:36,526;It could be done.
229;00:21:37,942;00:21:40,733;And this news
229;00:21:37,942;00:21:40,733;could be authentic.
230;00:21:40,734;00:21:42,400;It's possible.
231;00:21:44,900;00:21:47,233;It's also possible
231;00:21:44,900;00:21:47,233;that this message
232;00:21:47,234;00:21:49,525;is part of a ploy
232;00:21:47,234;00:21:49,525;by the Dragon Queen
233;00:21:49,526;00:21:52,483;to lure southern armies away from the
233;00:21:49,526;00:21:52,483;lands they are currently defending
234;00:21:52,484;00:21:54,525;to open those lands
234;00:21:52,484;00:21:54,525;to easy conquest.
235;00:21:54,526;00:21:56,233;That does seem far more likely
236;00:21:56,234;00:21:58,191;than magic birds
236;00:21:56,234;00:21:58,191;talking to cripples.
237;00:21:58,192;00:22:00,733;Archmaester, please.
238;00:22:00,734;00:22:01,900;It's real.
239;00:22:03,817;00:22:04,900;I've seen it.
240;00:22:07,734;00:22:09,233;We will write to Maester Wolkan
241;00:22:09,234;00:22:11,608;at Winterfell for clarification.
242;00:22:11,609;00:22:14,483;I promise you we will get to the
242;00:22:11,609;00:22:14,483;truth of it one way or another.
243;00:22:14,484;00:22:17,191;Archmaester, please--
243;00:22:14,484;00:22:17,191;That will be all, Tarly.
244;00:22:17,192;00:22:19,691;It brings to mind the
244;00:22:17,192;00:22:19,691;work of Jenny of Oldstones,
245;00:22:19,692;00:22:22,316;the charlatan who claimed descent
245;00:22:19,692;00:22:22,316;from the children of the forest.
246;00:22:22,317;00:22:25,107;Don't forget the prophet Lodos,
247;00:22:25,108;00:22:28,775;who promised that the Drowned God would
247;00:22:25,108;00:22:28,775;rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.
248;00:22:28,776;00:22:31,067;Ah, Lodos.
249;00:22:34,359;00:22:38,899;Is he the one whose father and
249;00:22:34,359;00:22:38,899;brother were just burnt alive?
250;00:22:38,900;00:22:40,857;I'm afraid so.
251;00:22:40,858;00:22:42,107;Horrible business.
252;00:22:42,108;00:22:44,733;I haven't had the heart
252;00:22:42,108;00:22:44,733;to tell him yet.
253;00:22:44,734;00:22:46,775;He's a good lad.
254;00:22:46,776;00:22:48,525;Right.
255;00:22:48,526;00:22:51,441;The ravenry was falling apart
255;00:22:48,526;00:22:51,441;the last time I checked.
256;00:22:56,651;00:22:59,274;All rulers demand
256;00:22:56,651;00:22:59,274;that people bend the knee.
257;00:22:59,275;00:23:00,484;That's why they're rulers.
258;00:23:03,609;00:23:05,608;She gave Tarly a choice,
259;00:23:05,609;00:23:08,441;a man who had taken up
259;00:23:05,609;00:23:08,441;arms against her.
260;00:23:08,442;00:23:10,191;What else could she do?
261;00:23:10,192;00:23:13,316;Not burn him alive
261;00:23:10,192;00:23:13,316;alongside his son?
262;00:23:13,317;00:23:15,650;I am her Hand, not her head.
263;00:23:15,651;00:23:17,899;I can't make
263;00:23:15,651;00:23:17,899;her decisions for her.
264;00:23:17,900;00:23:21,191;That's what I used to tell
264;00:23:17,900;00:23:21,191;myself about her father.
265;00:23:21,192;00:23:25,566;I found the traitors, but I wasn't
265;00:23:21,192;00:23:25,566;the one burning them alive.
266;00:23:25,567;00:23:28,317;I was only a purveyor
266;00:23:25,567;00:23:28,317;of information.
267;00:23:33,484;00:23:37,525;It's what I told myself when I
267;00:23:33,484;00:23:37,525;watched them beg for mercy--
268;00:23:37,526;00:23:40,107;I'm not the one doing it.
269;00:23:40,108;00:23:42,566;When the pitch of their
269;00:23:40,108;00:23:42,566;screams rose higher--
270;00:23:42,567;00:23:44,608;I'm not the one doing it.
271;00:23:44,609;00:23:46,191;When their hair caught fire
272;00:23:46,192;00:23:49,066;and the smell of their burning
272;00:23:46,192;00:23:49,066;flesh filled the throne room--
273;00:23:49,067;00:23:50,692;I'm not the one doing it.
274;00:23:59,359;00:24:01,566;Daenerys is not her father.
275;00:24:01,567;00:24:03,982;And she never will be
276;00:24:03,983;00:24:06,025;with the right counsel.
277;00:24:09,275;00:24:11,692;You need to find a way
277;00:24:09,275;00:24:11,692;to make her listen.
278;00:24:14,150;00:24:17,525;Who's that for?
278;00:24:14,150;00:24:17,525;Jon Snow.
279;00:24:17,526;00:24:19,066;Did you read it?
280;00:24:19,067;00:24:22,108;It's a sealed scroll
280;00:24:19,067;00:24:22,108;for the King in the North.
281;00:24:28,234;00:24:29,692;What's it say?
282;00:24:30,776;00:24:32,359;Nothing good.
283;00:24:38,858;00:24:42,233;I thought Arya was dead.
284;00:24:42,234;00:24:45,316;I thought Bran was dead.
285;00:24:45,317;00:24:46,734;I'm happy for you.
286;00:24:49,108;00:24:50,525;You don't look happy.
287;00:24:50,526;00:24:52,899;Bran saw the Night King
287;00:24:50,526;00:24:52,899;and his army
288;00:24:52,900;00:24:54,900;marching towards Eastwatch.
289;00:24:56,484;00:24:58,483;If they make it past the Wall...
290;00:24:58,484;00:25:01,191;The Wall has kept them out for
290;00:24:58,484;00:25:01,191;thousands of years, presumably.
291;00:25:01,192;00:25:02,857;I need to go home.
292;00:25:02,858;00:25:04,566;You said you don't
292;00:25:02,858;00:25:04,566;have enough men.
293;00:25:04,567;00:25:07,149;We'll fight
293;00:25:04,567;00:25:07,149;with the men we have.
294;00:25:07,150;00:25:08,775;Unless you'll join us.
295;00:25:08,776;00:25:10,941;And give the country to Cersei?
296;00:25:10,942;00:25:14,775;As soon as I march away,
296;00:25:10,942;00:25:14,775;she marches in.
297;00:25:14,776;00:25:17,107;Perhaps not.
298;00:25:17,108;00:25:20,525;Cersei thinks the Army of the
298;00:25:17,108;00:25:20,525;Dead is nothing but a story
299;00:25:20,526;00:25:23,775;made up by wet nurses
299;00:25:20,526;00:25:23,775;to frighten children.
300;00:25:23,776;00:25:25,525;What if we prove her wrong?
301;00:25:25,526;00:25:28,942;I don't think she'll come see
301;00:25:25,526;00:25:28,942;the dead at my invitation.
302;00:25:30,234;00:25:32,275;So bring the dead to her.
303;00:25:33,734;00:25:35,608;I thought that was what
303;00:25:33,734;00:25:35,608;we were trying to avoid.
304;00:25:35,609;00:25:37,982;We don't have to
304;00:25:35,609;00:25:37,982;bring the whole army.
305;00:25:37,983;00:25:40,024;Only one soldier.
306;00:25:40,025;00:25:41,942;Is that possible?
307;00:25:45,776;00:25:47,483;The first wight I ever saw
308;00:25:47,484;00:25:50,316;was brought into Castle
308;00:25:47,484;00:25:50,316;Black from beyond the Wall.
309;00:25:50,317;00:25:52,650;Bring one of these things
309;00:25:50,317;00:25:52,650;down to King's Landing
310;00:25:52,651;00:25:54,941;and show her the truth.
311;00:25:54,942;00:25:56,982;Anything you bring back
311;00:25:54,942;00:25:56,982;will be useless
312;00:25:56,983;00:25:58,816;unless Cersei
312;00:25:56,983;00:25:58,816;grants us an audience
313;00:25:58,817;00:26:01,358;and is somehow convinced
313;00:25:58,817;00:26:01,358;not to murder us
314;00:26:01,359;00:26:03,608;the moment we set foot
314;00:26:01,359;00:26:03,608;in the capital.
315;00:26:03,609;00:26:07,191;The only person
315;00:26:03,609;00:26:07,191;she listens to is Jaime.
316;00:26:07,192;00:26:09,025;He might listen to me.
317;00:26:13,025;00:26:14,858;And how would you get
317;00:26:13,025;00:26:14,858;into King's Landing?
318;00:26:21,025;00:26:22,857;I can smuggle you in,
319;00:26:22,858;00:26:25,483;but if the gold cloaks
319;00:26:22,858;00:26:25,483;were to recognize you,
320;00:26:25,484;00:26:28,691;I'm warning you,
320;00:26:25,484;00:26:28,691;I'm not a fighter.
321;00:26:28,692;00:26:30,107;Well, it will all be for nothing
322;00:26:30,108;00:26:31,899;if we don't have
322;00:26:30,108;00:26:31,899;one of these dead men.
323;00:26:31,900;00:26:33,274;Fair point.
324;00:26:33,275;00:26:34,567;How do you propose to find one?
325;00:26:37,983;00:26:41,192;With the queen's permission,
325;00:26:37,983;00:26:41,192;I'll go north and take one.
326;00:26:42,900;00:26:46,233;You asked me to find a
326;00:26:42,900;00:26:46,233;cure so I could serve you.
327;00:26:46,234;00:26:47,858;Allow me to serve you.
328;00:26:51,858;00:26:53,358;The Free Folk will help us.
329;00:26:53,359;00:26:56,107;They know the real north
329;00:26:53,359;00:26:56,107;better than anyone.
330;00:26:56,108;00:26:57,650;They won't follow Ser Jorah.
331;00:26:57,651;00:26:58,858;They won't have to.
332;00:27:05,900;00:27:08,316;You can't lead a raid
332;00:27:05,900;00:27:08,316;beyond the Wall.
333;00:27:08,317;00:27:10,941;You're not in the Night's Watch
333;00:27:08,317;00:27:10,941;anymore, you're King in the North.
334;00:27:10,942;00:27:13,525;I'm the only one here
334;00:27:10,942;00:27:13,525;who's fought them.
335;00:27:13,526;00:27:15,900;I'm the only one here
335;00:27:13,526;00:27:15,900;who knows them.
336;00:27:17,275;00:27:19,275;I haven't given you
336;00:27:17,275;00:27:19,275;permission to leave.
337;00:27:22,108;00:27:25,483;With respect, Your Grace,
337;00:27:22,108;00:27:25,483;I don't need your permission.
338;00:27:25,484;00:27:26,692;I am a king.
339;00:27:28,317;00:27:29,733;And I came here
340;00:27:29,734;00:27:31,566;knowing that you could
340;00:27:29,734;00:27:31,566;have your men behead me
341;00:27:31,567;00:27:34,775;or your dragons burn me alive.
342;00:27:34,776;00:27:39,191;I put my trust
342;00:27:34,776;00:27:39,191;in you, a stranger,
343;00:27:39,192;00:27:42,191;because I knew it was the
343;00:27:39,192;00:27:42,191;best chance for my people,
344;00:27:42,192;00:27:44,359;for all our people.
345;00:27:45,900;00:27:50,234;Now I'm asking you
345;00:27:45,900;00:27:50,234;to trust in a stranger...
346;00:27:51,942;00:27:54,442;because it's our best chance.
347;00:28:12,442;00:28:16,776;The King in the North
347;00:28:12,442;00:28:16,776;should stay in the North.
348;00:28:19,317;00:28:23,691;We did not choose you
348;00:28:19,317;00:28:23,691;to rule us, my lady.
349;00:28:23,692;00:28:26,526;But perhaps we should have.
350;00:28:29,025;00:28:33,816;The Knights of the Vale came
350;00:28:29,025;00:28:33,816;here for you, Lady Stark.
351;00:28:33,817;00:28:35,275;Aye.
352;00:28:39,734;00:28:43,149;You are very kind, my lords.
353;00:28:43,150;00:28:45,191;But Jon is our king.
354;00:28:45,192;00:28:47,733;He is doing what
354;00:28:45,192;00:28:47,733;he thinks is best.
355;00:28:57,651;00:28:59,691;I warned Jon this would happen.
356;00:28:59,692;00:29:01,358;That he couldn't leave the North
357;00:29:01,359;00:29:04,191;and expect it to just sit
357;00:29:01,359;00:29:04,191;and wait for him like Ghost.
358;00:29:04,192;00:29:06,566;He didn't. He trusted
358;00:29:04,192;00:29:06,566;you to hold it for him.
359;00:29:06,567;00:29:09,359;Well, he's not making it easy.
359;00:29:06,567;00:29:09,359;The Northern lords are proud.
360;00:29:14,025;00:29:16,316;These are Mother
360;00:29:14,025;00:29:16,316;and Father's chambers.
361;00:29:16,317;00:29:17,858;And?
362;00:29:20,567;00:29:22,899;Nothing.
363;00:29:22,900;00:29:25,691;Don't do that.
364;00:29:25,692;00:29:28,192;What?
364;00:29:25,692;00:29:28,192;Say what you mean.
365;00:29:29,858;00:29:32,317;You always liked nice things.
366;00:29:33,692;00:29:36,025;They made you feel
366;00:29:33,692;00:29:36,025;better than everyone.
367;00:29:40,942;00:29:42,525;Are you angry with me?
368;00:29:42,526;00:29:44,857;They were insulting Jon,
369;00:29:44,858;00:29:46,233;and you sat there and listened.
370;00:29:46,234;00:29:47,733;I listened to their complaints,
371;00:29:47,734;00:29:50,775;which is my responsibility
371;00:29:47,734;00:29:50,775;as Lady of Winterfell.
372;00:29:50,776;00:29:53,733;Their opinions
372;00:29:50,776;00:29:53,733;are important to you.
373;00:29:53,734;00:29:56,441;Glover has 500 men,
373;00:29:53,734;00:29:56,441;Royce has 2,000.
374;00:29:56,442;00:29:59,399;Offend them
374;00:29:56,442;00:29:59,399;and Jon loses his army.
375;00:29:59,400;00:30:01,400;Not if they lose
375;00:29:59,400;00:30:01,400;their heads first.
376;00:30:04,858;00:30:08,024;Winterfell didn't just
376;00:30:04,858;00:30:08,024;fall into our hands.
377;00:30:08,025;00:30:09,899;We took it back,
378;00:30:09,900;00:30:11,857;and the Mormonts
378;00:30:09,900;00:30:11,857;and the Hornwoods
379;00:30:11,858;00:30:13,316;and the wildlings and the Vale.
380;00:30:13,317;00:30:14,857;All of us, working together.
381;00:30:14,858;00:30:19,191;Now, I'm sure cutting off
381;00:30:14,858;00:30:19,191;heads is very satisfying,
382;00:30:19,192;00:30:22,734;but that's not the way you
382;00:30:19,192;00:30:22,734;get people to work together.
383;00:30:25,900;00:30:28,191;And if Jon doesn't come back,
384;00:30:28,192;00:30:30,149;you'll need their support...
385;00:30:30,150;00:30:32,274;so you can work together
386;00:30:32,275;00:30:34,233;to give you
386;00:30:32,275;00:30:34,233;what you really want.
387;00:30:34,234;00:30:36,817;How can you even think
387;00:30:34,234;00:30:36,817;such a horrible thing?
388;00:30:39,526;00:30:41,567;You're thinking it right now.
389;00:30:43,567;00:30:46,525;You don't want to be,
390;00:30:46,526;00:30:48,817;but the thought
390;00:30:46,526;00:30:48,817;just won't go away.
391;00:30:54,734;00:30:56,609;I have work to do.
392;00:31:00,275;00:31:01,567;My lady.
393;00:31:13,609;00:31:16,857;Last time I was here, I killed
393;00:31:13,609;00:31:16,857;my father with a crossbow.
394;00:31:16,858;00:31:19,817;Last time I was here, you
394;00:31:16,858;00:31:19,817;killed my son with wildfire.
395;00:31:22,983;00:31:25,816;There's a path to the left
395;00:31:22,983;00:31:25,816;that hugs the cliff.
396;00:31:25,817;00:31:28,483;The guards
396;00:31:25,817;00:31:28,483;hardly ever patrol it.
397;00:31:28,484;00:31:29,858;Too many steps.
398;00:31:34,734;00:31:36,024;You're not staying here?
399;00:31:36,025;00:31:39,525;I've got my own business
399;00:31:36,025;00:31:39,525;in Flea Bottom.
400;00:31:39,526;00:31:41,358;What if someone takes the boat?
401;00:31:41,359;00:31:43,651;Then we're fucked.
401;00:31:41,359;00:31:43,651;Best hurry.
402;00:31:49,067;00:31:50,483;We don't have time for this.
403;00:31:50,484;00:31:52,650;We should be preparing
403;00:31:50,484;00:31:52,650;the city for a siege.
404;00:31:52,651;00:31:53,816;The Dothraki are coming.
405;00:31:53,817;00:31:55,941;All the more reason
405;00:31:53,817;00:31:55,941;for you to train.
406;00:31:55,942;00:31:57,941;Unless you plan on fighting
406;00:31:55,942;00:31:57,941;Dothraki 12-year-olds.
407;00:31:57,942;00:32:00,483;Well, I seem to recall them giving
407;00:31:57,942;00:32:00,483;you a bit of trouble as well.
408;00:32:00,484;00:32:02,483;And here I am, ready to train.
409;00:32:02,484;00:32:04,441;Why down here?
410;00:32:04,442;00:32:06,274;I don't think
410;00:32:04,442;00:32:06,274;you want people to see
411;00:32:06,275;00:32:09,191;how you look swinging
411;00:32:06,275;00:32:09,191;that thing yet.
412;00:32:09,192;00:32:11,982;Today might be the day
412;00:32:09,192;00:32:11,982;I kill you by accident.
413;00:32:11,983;00:32:14,526;Oh, you won't be
413;00:32:11,983;00:32:14,526;swinging it at me.
414;00:32:22,734;00:32:24,400;I'll leave you to it.
415;00:32:28,192;00:32:29,526;I needed to see you.
416;00:32:30,983;00:32:32,817;And I knew you'd
416;00:32:30,983;00:32:32,817;never agree to meet.
417;00:32:36,359;00:32:39,316;You made me look
417;00:32:36,359;00:32:39,316;like a complete fool.
418;00:32:39,317;00:32:41,608;I thought I'd surprise you
418;00:32:39,317;00:32:41,608;by hitting Casterly Rock,
419;00:32:41,609;00:32:44,566;but you were
419;00:32:41,609;00:32:44,566;three steps ahead of me.
420;00:32:44,567;00:32:47,149;Abandoned the family home,
420;00:32:44,567;00:32:47,149;completely unsentimental.
421;00:32:47,150;00:32:48,650;Father would have been proud.
422;00:32:48,651;00:32:50,399;Don't talk about Father.
422;00:32:48,651;00:32:50,399;Listen to me--
423;00:32:50,400;00:32:51,899;I once told Bronn
424;00:32:51,900;00:32:54,734;that if I ever saw you
424;00:32:51,900;00:32:54,734;again, I'd cut you in half.
425;00:32:57,734;00:33:00,234;It'll take you a while
425;00:32:57,734;00:33:00,234;with a sparring sword.
426;00:33:09,400;00:33:11,316;He was going to execute me.
427;00:33:11,317;00:33:14,024;He knew I was innocent.
428;00:33:14,025;00:33:16,358;He didn't hate me
428;00:33:14,025;00:33:16,358;because of anything I did,
429;00:33:16,359;00:33:18,733;he hated me
429;00:33:16,359;00:33:18,733;because of what I am.
430;00:33:18,734;00:33:21,900;A little monster
430;00:33:18,734;00:33:21,900;sent to punish him.
431;00:33:23,776;00:33:25,982;Did he--
431;00:33:23,776;00:33:25,982;did he think--
432;00:33:25,983;00:33:27,775;did he think I wanted
432;00:33:25,983;00:33:27,775;to be born this way?
433;00:33:27,776;00:33:29,656;Did he think I chose it--
433;00:33:27,776;00:33:29,656;What do you want?!
434;00:33:36,192;00:33:37,734;Daenerys will win this war.
435;00:33:40,108;00:33:41,525;You're a military man.
436;00:33:41,526;00:33:44,275;You must know there's
436;00:33:41,526;00:33:44,275;no way around that.
437;00:33:46,317;00:33:47,899;Daenerys is not her father.
438;00:33:47,900;00:33:50,775;She's even willing
438;00:33:47,900;00:33:50,775;to suspend the hostilities
439;00:33:50,776;00:33:53,275;if Cersei agrees
439;00:33:50,776;00:33:53,275;to certain terms.
440;00:33:54,442;00:33:55,816;If you want Cersei
440;00:33:54,442;00:33:55,816;to bend the knee,
441;00:33:55,817;00:33:57,274;you can ask her yourself.
442;00:33:57,275;00:33:59,651;I-- I don't.
442;00:33:57,275;00:33:59,651;And Daenerys doesn't.
443;00:34:01,067;00:34:02,776;Not right now, anyway.
444;00:34:04,942;00:34:07,192;She has a more
444;00:34:04,942;00:34:07,192;important request.
445;00:34:46,692;00:34:48,900;I wasn't sure I'd find you.
446;00:34:56,192;00:34:58,191;Thought you might
446;00:34:56,192;00:34:58,191;still be rowing.
447;00:35:01,817;00:35:04,899;I looked in shops,
447;00:35:01,817;00:35:04,899;taverns, brothels.
448;00:35:04,900;00:35:08,191;Should have known to come
448;00:35:04,900;00:35:08,191;straight to the Street of Steel.
449;00:35:08,192;00:35:10,691;Aren't you worried
449;00:35:08,192;00:35:10,691;about the gold cloaks?
450;00:35:10,692;00:35:12,107;Haven't been here in years.
451;00:35:12,108;00:35:14,525;Why should they recognize me?
452;00:35:14,526;00:35:17,192;Sometimes I hardly do.
453;00:35:18,858;00:35:21,025;Nothing fucks you
453;00:35:18,858;00:35:21,025;harder than time.
454;00:35:25,817;00:35:27,899;Anybody give you any trouble?
455;00:35:27,900;00:35:30,358;Here I am, arming Lannisters,
456;00:35:30,359;00:35:32,233;and I never get a second look.
457;00:35:32,234;00:35:33,733;But you were right.
458;00:35:33,734;00:35:36,274;Safest place for me was
458;00:35:33,734;00:35:36,274;right under the queen's nose.
459;00:35:36,275;00:35:37,775;Don't be so sure.
460;00:35:37,776;00:35:40,692;Safety is never a permanent
460;00:35:37,776;00:35:40,692;state of affairs.
461;00:35:42,900;00:35:44,442;Bad things are coming.
462;00:35:46,942;00:35:50,163;You came to get me.
462;00:35:46,942;00:35:50,163;You want me to come with you.
463;00:35:50,283;00:35:51,322;Well, the thing you need to
463;00:35:50,283;00:35:51,322;understand is--
464;00:35:51,442;00:35:52,012;I'm ready.
465;00:35:52,132;00:35:53,483;You--
465;00:35:52,132;00:35:53,483;Let's go.
466;00:35:53,484;00:35:55,399;You should know
466;00:35:53,484;00:35:55,399;what you're heading into.
467;00:35:55,400;00:35:57,399;What do you think
467;00:35:55,400;00:35:57,399;I've been thinking about
468;00:35:57,400;00:35:58,775;with every swing of the hammer?
469;00:35:58,776;00:36:01,233;How happy I am making weapons
470;00:36:01,234;00:36:03,691;for the family
470;00:36:01,234;00:36:03,691;that killed my father?
471;00:36:03,692;00:36:05,399;The family that
471;00:36:03,692;00:36:05,399;tried to kill me?
472;00:36:07,526;00:36:09,775;I've been getting ready.
473;00:36:09,776;00:36:11,233;I never knew what for,
474;00:36:11,234;00:36:13,776;but I've always known
474;00:36:11,234;00:36:13,776;I'd know it when it comes.
475;00:36:15,442;00:36:18,525;You might want to bring
475;00:36:15,442;00:36:18,525;one of those swords.
476;00:36:18,526;00:36:20,442;I don't know much
476;00:36:18,526;00:36:20,442;about swinging swords.
477;00:36:21,942;00:36:23,275;But this...
478;00:36:25,108;00:36:26,442;this I know.
479;00:36:35,526;00:36:36,941;Keep your father's name
479;00:36:35,526;00:36:36,941;to yourself.
480;00:36:36,942;00:36:39,734;Situation's complicated
480;00:36:36,942;00:36:39,734;enough already.
481;00:36:41,108;00:36:42,776;Well, who should I say I am?
482;00:36:46,609;00:36:49,024;I told you, Clovis, if we
482;00:36:46,609;00:36:49,024;don't get out of here soon,
483;00:36:49,025;00:36:50,865;someone's going to--
483;00:36:49,025;00:36:50,865;You there!
484;00:36:53,150;00:36:55,484;No weapons, friends.
484;00:36:53,150;00:36:55,484;I promise.
485;00:36:56,692;00:36:58,149;What can I do for you?
486;00:36:58,150;00:37:00,650;Is that your boat?
486;00:36:58,150;00:37:00,650;It is.
487;00:37:00,651;00:37:03,066;The docks are that way.
487;00:37:00,651;00:37:03,066;That they are.
488;00:37:03,067;00:37:04,566;I try to stay away from them
489;00:37:04,567;00:37:06,817;to avoid good men
489;00:37:04,567;00:37:06,817;such as yourselves.
490;00:37:09,442;00:37:12,816;Still five gold dragons?
490;00:37:09,442;00:37:12,816;Are you joking?
491;00:37:12,817;00:37:15,066;You must be even older
491;00:37:12,817;00:37:15,066;than you look.
492;00:37:15,067;00:37:16,982;15.
492;00:37:15,067;00:37:16,982;15?!
493;00:37:16,983;00:37:18,108;Apiece.
494;00:37:26,526;00:37:28,651;I can't say it was a pleasure
494;00:37:26,526;00:37:28,651;doing business with you.
495;00:37:31,150;00:37:32,526;What's in the boat?
496;00:37:38,067;00:37:39,233;Not more gold.
497;00:37:39,234;00:37:40,982;Wine?
497;00:37:39,234;00:37:40,982;Mm.
498;00:37:40,983;00:37:42,983;I like wine.
498;00:37:40,983;00:37:42,983;Or hams.
499;00:37:44,900;00:37:46,025;Come have a look.
500;00:37:54,567;00:37:56,483;Fermented crab.
500;00:37:54,567;00:37:56,483;What?
501;00:37:56,484;00:37:58,358;Fermented crab.
502;00:37:58,359;00:38:01,358;One bucket of this triples a
502;00:37:58,359;00:38:01,358;brothel's earnings for the week.
503;00:38:01,359;00:38:03,316;A man thinks he's done.
504;00:38:03,317;00:38:05,899;He's ready to go back
504;00:38:03,317;00:38:05,899;to his loving family.
505;00:38:05,900;00:38:07,816;But before he gets
505;00:38:05,900;00:38:07,816;his breeches up,
506;00:38:07,817;00:38:11,191;his lady of the hour pops a tiny
506;00:38:07,817;00:38:11,191;spoon of that into his mouth.
507;00:38:11,192;00:38:14,733;Five minutes later,
507;00:38:11,192;00:38:14,733;he's back in the race.
508;00:38:14,734;00:38:17,234;Here, have a taste.
509;00:38:29,900;00:38:31,775;I'd hurry to your
509;00:38:29,900;00:38:31,775;favorite establishment,
510;00:38:31,776;00:38:34,274;or you'll put a hole
510;00:38:31,776;00:38:34,274;in that chainmail.
511;00:39:01,275;00:39:03,275;Oi, dwarf!
512;00:39:04,609;00:39:06,149;I really wouldn't try any more
513;00:39:06,150;00:39:08,191;until you see how
513;00:39:06,150;00:39:08,191;the first bite hits you.
514;00:39:08,192;00:39:10,066;That dwarf...
515;00:39:10,067;00:39:11,691;Where'd you get that scar?
516;00:39:11,692;00:39:14,233;Fish hook. Some men
516;00:39:11,692;00:39:14,233;you just can't teach.
517;00:39:14,234;00:39:17,316;We was looking for a dwarf with
517;00:39:14,234;00:39:17,316;a scar like that a while back.
518;00:39:17,317;00:39:19,358;Perhaps there's
518;00:39:17,317;00:39:19,358;some arrangement?
519;00:39:21,776;00:39:23,733;Arrangement?
520;00:39:23,734;00:39:26,941;You gonna arrange to pay us
520;00:39:23,734;00:39:26,941;more than Queen Cersei--
521;00:39:34,776;00:39:36,483;This is Gendry.
522;00:39:36,484;00:39:37,983;He'll do.
523;00:39:40,692;00:39:41,692;Go, go, go.
524;00:39:44,484;00:39:45,982;I could give you something.
525;00:39:45,983;00:39:47,484;That won't be necessary.
526;00:39:56,150;00:39:57,150;Ser Jaime.
527;00:39:59,983;00:40:02,651;Why was Qyburn here?
528;00:40:04,067;00:40:06,317;He's the Hand of the Queen.
528;00:40:04,067;00:40:06,317;Why are you here?
529;00:40:10,983;00:40:13,526;I met with Tyrion.
530;00:40:21,400;00:40:24,150;What did our brother
530;00:40:21,400;00:40:24,150;have to say?
531;00:40:26,734;00:40:29,191;Daenerys wants to meet.
532;00:40:29,192;00:40:31,816;To discuss her surrender?
533;00:40:31,817;00:40:33,650;To discuss an armistice.
534;00:40:33,651;00:40:36,441;She's just won a great victory.
534;00:40:33,651;00:40:36,441;Why would she want a truce now?
535;00:40:36,442;00:40:38,191;Because an army of dead men
536;00:40:38,192;00:40:40,734;is marching
536;00:40:38,192;00:40:40,734;on the Seven Kingdoms.
537;00:40:43,234;00:40:45,066;Tyrion claims he'll have proof.
538;00:40:48,942;00:40:51,316;Are you going to punish him?
538;00:40:48,942;00:40:51,316;Tyrion?
539;00:40:51,317;00:40:52,817;Bronn.
540;00:40:55,359;00:40:57,733;He betrayed you.
541;00:40:57,734;00:41:00,108;He set up a meeting without
541;00:40:57,734;00:41:00,108;your knowledge or consent.
542;00:41:03,942;00:41:05,233;Do you think
542;00:41:03,942;00:41:05,233;anything of importance
543;00:41:05,234;00:41:07,733;happens in this city
543;00:41:05,234;00:41:07,733;without me knowing?
544;00:41:07,734;00:41:10,982;You let it happen.
544;00:41:07,734;00:41:10,982;Why?
545;00:41:10,983;00:41:13,650;I've come to believe that
546;00:41:13,651;00:41:16,358;an accommodation
546;00:41:13,651;00:41:16,358;with the Dragon Queen
547;00:41:16,359;00:41:18,899;could be in our
547;00:41:16,359;00:41:18,899;immediate interest.
548;00:41:18,900;00:41:22,233;She has the numbers. If we want to
548;00:41:18,900;00:41:22,233;beat her, we have to be clever.
549;00:41:22,234;00:41:24,400;We have to fight her
549;00:41:22,234;00:41:24,400;like Father would have.
550;00:41:27,858;00:41:31,025;Dead men, dragons,
550;00:41:27,858;00:41:31,025;and Dragon Queens...
551;00:41:33,067;00:41:36,066;Whatever stands in our way,
552;00:41:36,067;00:41:37,816;we will defeat it.
553;00:41:37,817;00:41:40,608;For ourselves, for our house,
554;00:41:40,609;00:41:42,609;for this.
555;00:41:55,234;00:41:56,816;Who will you say is the father?
556;00:41:56,817;00:41:58,108;You.
557;00:42:04,025;00:42:05,275;People won't like that.
558;00:42:08,900;00:42:13,316;Do you remember what Father
558;00:42:08,900;00:42:13,316;used to say about people?
559;00:42:13,317;00:42:17,275;The lion does not concern himself
559;00:42:13,317;00:42:17,275;with the opinions of the sheep.
560;00:42:31,192;00:42:33,150;Never betray me again.
561;00:42:38,234;00:42:40,149;We're leaving today.
562;00:42:40,150;00:42:43,733;The king's got a lot on his mind.
562;00:42:40,150;00:42:43,733;I understand.
563;00:42:43,734;00:42:46,316;He doesn't need to be thinking about
563;00:42:43,734;00:42:46,316;harboring the bastard of a dead king.
564;00:42:46,317;00:42:48,775;You don't have to worry.
564;00:42:46,317;00:42:48,775;You're just Clovis,
565;00:42:48,776;00:42:51,107;a smith who's come
565;00:42:48,776;00:42:51,107;to pay his respects
566;00:42:51,108;00:42:54,107;before he heads off to work
566;00:42:51,108;00:42:54,107;at the Winterfell forges.
567;00:42:54,108;00:42:56,107;Understood.
568;00:42:57,567;00:42:59,733;Begging your pardon, Your Grace.
569;00:42:59,734;00:43:01,191;You survived King's Landing.
570;00:43:01,192;00:43:04,191;Yet again. Your
570;00:43:01,192;00:43:04,191;Grace, this is Clo--
571;00:43:04,192;00:43:06,608;Name's Gendry, Your Grace.
572;00:43:06,609;00:43:08,191;I'm Robert Baratheon's son.
573;00:43:08,192;00:43:09,317;Bastard son.
574;00:43:12,400;00:43:14,857;He was meant
574;00:43:12,400;00:43:14,857;to keep that to himself.
575;00:43:14,858;00:43:16,691;Our fathers trusted each other.
576;00:43:16,692;00:43:18,025;Why shouldn't we?
577;00:43:20,317;00:43:22,816;I saw your father once
577;00:43:20,317;00:43:22,816;at Winterfell.
578;00:43:22,817;00:43:26,025;I met yours in my shop.
579;00:43:27,734;00:43:30,067;You're a lot leaner.
579;00:43:27,734;00:43:30,067;And you're a lot shorter.
580;00:43:40,150;00:43:43,941;I grew up on stories about them.
581;00:43:43,942;00:43:46,942;All I ever knew is that
581;00:43:43,942;00:43:46,942;they fought together and won.
582;00:43:48,692;00:43:51,483;Ser Davos told me where you're
582;00:43:48,692;00:43:51,483;going, Your Grace, and why.
583;00:43:51,484;00:43:53,274;Let me come with you.
584;00:43:53,275;00:43:55,149;Don't be a fool.
584;00:43:53,275;00:43:55,149;You're not a soldier.
585;00:43:55,150;00:43:56,982;No, but I'm a fighter.
586;00:43:56,983;00:44:00,067;And he won't be needing a
586;00:43:56,983;00:44:00,067;smith with a sword like that.
587;00:44:02,484;00:44:03,982;You know how to use one?
588;00:44:03,983;00:44:06,358;Well, that's a problem.
589;00:44:06,359;00:44:07,900;I prefer a hammer.
590;00:44:10,900;00:44:12,609;He can handle himself.
591;00:44:14,400;00:44:16,483;We could use the help.
592;00:44:16,484;00:44:18,358;As my father used to say,
593;00:44:18,359;00:44:20,441;It's better to be
593;00:44:18,359;00:44:20,441;a coward for a minute,
594;00:44:20,442;00:44:22,691;than dead for
594;00:44:20,442;00:44:22,691;the rest of your life.
595;00:44:22,692;00:44:25,107;I owe you my life.
596;00:44:25,108;00:44:26,899;Twice over.
597;00:44:26,900;00:44:30,149;But if what you said is true
597;00:44:26,900;00:44:30,149;about what's up there,
598;00:44:30,150;00:44:32,609;I can't wait out this war.
599;00:44:36,400;00:44:38,316;Yeah, nobody mind me.
600;00:44:38,317;00:44:42,358;All I've ever done
600;00:44:38,317;00:44:42,358;is live to a ripe old age.
601;00:44:42,359;00:44:44,274;All right, come on.
602;00:44:53,858;00:44:56,107;You may not believe it,
603;00:44:56,108;00:44:58,816;but I've missed you, Mormont.
604;00:44:58,817;00:45:01,941;Nobody glowers quite like you.
605;00:45:01,942;00:45:03,234;Not even Grey Worm.
606;00:45:09,025;00:45:10,982;This is the coin
606;00:45:09,025;00:45:10,982;the slaver gave me
607;00:45:10,983;00:45:13,982;when I suggested he free us
607;00:45:10,983;00:45:13,982;and pay us, remember?
608;00:45:13,983;00:45:17,817;It was supposed to last us
608;00:45:13,983;00:45:17,817;the rest of our lives.
609;00:45:22,275;00:45:23,651;Take it with you.
610;00:45:26,317;00:45:27,816;But bring it back.
611;00:45:27,817;00:45:28,983;Our queen needs you.
612;00:45:38,359;00:45:40,817;We should be better
612;00:45:38,359;00:45:40,817;at saying farewell by now.
613;00:45:42,484;00:45:43,983;Your Grace, I...
614;00:46:01,400;00:46:03,650;If I don't return, at least
614;00:46:01,400;00:46:03,650;you won't have to deal
615;00:46:03,651;00:46:05,011;with the King
615;00:46:03,651;00:46:05,011;in the North anymore.
616;00:46:07,317;00:46:09,192;I've grown used to him.
617;00:46:11,275;00:46:13,900;I wish you good fortune in the
617;00:46:11,275;00:46:13,900;wars to come, Your Grace.
618;00:46:22,983;00:46:24,651;Heave!
619;00:46:47,776;00:46:52,233;Do you know how many
619;00:46:47,776;00:46:52,233;steps there are in the Citadel?
620;00:46:52,234;00:46:53,441;No.
621;00:46:53,442;00:46:56,400;15,782.
622;00:47:00,983;00:47:04,400;Guess how many windows are
622;00:47:00,983;00:47:04,400;in the Great Sept of Baelor.
623;00:47:06,526;00:47:09,066;None anymore.
624;00:47:09,067;00:47:10,733;That's true.
625;00:47:10,734;00:47:15,066;This High Septon Maynard,
625;00:47:10,734;00:47:15,066;he recorded everything.
626;00:47:15,067;00:47:17,275;He even recorded
626;00:47:15,067;00:47:17,275;his own bowel movements.
627;00:47:20,817;00:47:24,024;What does annulment mean?
628;00:47:24,025;00:47:27,899;It's when a man
628;00:47:24,025;00:47:27,899;sets aside his lawful wife.
629;00:47:27,900;00:47:33,274;Maynard says here that he issued
629;00:47:27,900;00:47:33,274;an annulment for a Prince Ragger
630;00:47:33,275;00:47:36,775;and remarried him to someone
630;00:47:33,275;00:47:36,775;else at the same time
631;00:47:36,776;00:47:39,316;in a secret ceremony in Dorne.
632;00:47:39,317;00:47:41,233;Is that a common thing
632;00:47:39,317;00:47:41,233;in the south or--?
633;00:47:41,234;00:47:42,609;These maesters...
634;00:47:44,484;00:47:48,066;they set me to the task of preserving
634;00:47:44,484;00:47:48,066;that man's window counting
635;00:47:48,067;00:47:50,358;and annulments and bowel
635;00:47:48,067;00:47:50,358;movements for all eternity,
636;00:47:50,359;00:47:52,149;while the secret to
636;00:47:50,359;00:47:52,149;defeating the Night King's
637;00:47:52,150;00:47:54,816;probably sitting on some dusty shelf
637;00:47:52,150;00:47:54,816;somewhere, completely ignored.
638;00:47:54,817;00:47:56,733;But that's all right, isn't it?
639;00:47:56,734;00:48:00,816;We can all become slavering, murderous
639;00:47:56,734;00:48:00,816;imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate
640;00:48:00,817;00:48:02,441;as long as we can have access
640;00:48:00,817;00:48:02,441;to the full records
641;00:48:02,442;00:48:06,484;of High Septon Maynard's
641;00:48:02,442;00:48:06,484;15,782 shits!
642;00:48:08,817;00:48:10,442;Steps.
643;00:48:13,484;00:48:15,609;That number was the steps.
644;00:49:37,567;00:49:40,149;Are you sure
644;00:49:37,567;00:49:40,149;you want to do this?
645;00:49:40,150;00:49:42,567;You always wanted
645;00:49:40,150;00:49:42,567;to be a maester.
646;00:49:44,192;00:49:48,359;I'm tired of reading about
646;00:49:44,192;00:49:48,359;the achievements of better men.
647;00:51:17,442;00:51:19,317;I found it, my lord.
648;00:51:23,025;00:51:24,733;It, uh, took some searching.
649;00:51:24,734;00:51:26,817;Maester Luwin's archives
649;00:51:24,734;00:51:26,817;are very thorough.
650;00:51:31,526;00:51:34,149;You're sure this is the
650;00:51:31,526;00:51:34,149;only copy in Winterfell?
651;00:51:34,150;00:51:36,025;Uh, yes, my lord.
652;00:51:40,817;00:51:42,734;Lady Stark thanks you
652;00:51:40,817;00:51:42,734;for your service.
653;00:54:14,858;00:54:16,733;Isn't it your
653;00:54:14,858;00:54:16,733;job to talk him out
654;00:54:16,734;00:54:18,733;of stupid fucking
654;00:54:16,734;00:54:18,733;ideas like this?
655;00:54:18,734;00:54:21,526;I've been failing
655;00:54:18,734;00:54:21,526;at that job of late.
656;00:54:23,150;00:54:25,191;How many queens are there now?
657;00:54:25,192;00:54:26,525;Two.
658;00:54:26,526;00:54:29,691;And you need to convince
658;00:54:26,526;00:54:29,691;the one with the dragons
659;00:54:29,692;00:54:31,525;or the one who
659;00:54:29,692;00:54:31,525;fucks her brother?
660;00:54:33,359;00:54:34,359;Both.
661;00:54:34,360;00:54:36,400;How many men did you bring?
662;00:54:39,484;00:54:41,024;Not enough.
663;00:54:41,025;00:54:42,651;The big woman?
664;00:54:45,983;00:54:48,775;We were hoping some of
664;00:54:45,983;00:54:48,775;your men could help.
665;00:54:48,776;00:54:51,608;Hmm.
665;00:54:48,776;00:54:51,608;I'll be staying behind.
666;00:54:51,609;00:54:54,733;I'm a liability out there,
666;00:54:51,609;00:54:54,733;as you well know.
667;00:54:54,734;00:54:55,734;You are.
668;00:54:58,526;00:55:01,734;You really want to go out there?
668;00:54:58,526;00:55:01,734;Again?
669;00:55:08,025;00:55:09,776;You're not the only ones.
670;00:55:13,400;00:55:16,899;My scouts found them
670;00:55:13,400;00:55:16,899;a mile south of the Wall.
671;00:55:16,900;00:55:18,776;Said they were
671;00:55:16,900;00:55:18,776;on their way here.
672;00:55:25,609;00:55:27,067;You're the Hound.
673;00:55:29,067;00:55:30,900;I saw you once at Winterfell.
674;00:55:36,609;00:55:38,775;They want to go
674;00:55:36,609;00:55:38,775;beyond the Wall, too.
675;00:55:38,776;00:55:42,066;We don't want to go beyond
675;00:55:38,776;00:55:42,066;the Wall, we have to.
676;00:55:42,067;00:55:44,233;Our Lord told us that
676;00:55:42,067;00:55:44,233;the Great War is coming--
677;00:55:44,234;00:55:46,441;Don't trust him.
678;00:55:46,442;00:55:48,400;Don't trust any of them.
679;00:55:54,025;00:55:55,650;They're the Brotherhood.
680;00:55:55,651;00:55:58,233;And the last thing
680;00:55:55,651;00:55:58,233;their lord told them to do
681;00:55:58,234;00:56:00,608;was sell me to a red witch
681;00:55:58,234;00:56:00,608;to be murdered.
682;00:56:00,609;00:56:02,317;Thoros?
683;00:56:07,359;00:56:09,441;I hardly recognized you.
684;00:56:09,442;00:56:11,650;Ser Jorah Mormont.
685;00:56:11,651;00:56:14,608;They won't give me anything
685;00:56:11,651;00:56:14,608;to drink down here.
686;00:56:14,609;00:56:17,650;I haven't been feeling
686;00:56:14,609;00:56:17,650;like myself.
687;00:56:17,651;00:56:20,483;You're a fucking Mormont?
688;00:56:20,484;00:56:22,608;Like the last Lord Commander?
689;00:56:22,609;00:56:24,816;He was my father.
690;00:56:24,817;00:56:27,816;He hunted us like animals.
691;00:56:27,817;00:56:30,857;You returned the favor,
691;00:56:27,817;00:56:30,857;as I recall.
692;00:56:32,526;00:56:35,149;Here we all are
693;00:56:35,150;00:56:36,733;at the edge of the world
694;00:56:36,734;00:56:38,316;at the same moment,
695;00:56:38,317;00:56:40,817;heading in the same direction
695;00:56:38,317;00:56:40,817;for the same reason.
696;00:56:42,651;00:56:44,899;Our reasons aren't your reasons.
697;00:56:44,900;00:56:47,275;It doesn't matter
697;00:56:44,900;00:56:47,275;what we think our reasons are.
698;00:56:49,484;00:56:51,274;There's a greater
698;00:56:49,484;00:56:51,274;purpose at work.
699;00:56:51,275;00:56:54,566;And we serve it together,
700;00:56:54,567;00:56:56,857;whether we know it or not.
701;00:56:56,858;00:56:59,775;We may take the steps,
701;00:56:56,858;00:56:59,775;but the Lord of Light--
702;00:56:59,776;00:57:03,149;For fuck's sake,
702;00:56:59,776;00:57:03,149;will you shut your hole?
703;00:57:03,150;00:57:05,941;Are we coming with you or not?
704;00:57:05,942;00:57:08,149;Don't you want to know
704;00:57:05,942;00:57:08,149;what we're doing?
705;00:57:08,150;00:57:12,566;Is it worse than sitting in a
705;00:57:08,150;00:57:12,566;freezing cell, waiting to die?
706;00:57:12,567;00:57:14,566;He's right.
707;00:57:14,567;00:57:16,567;We're all on the same side.
708;00:57:19,067;00:57:20,192;How can we be?
709;00:57:21,817;00:57:23,900;We're all breathing.
