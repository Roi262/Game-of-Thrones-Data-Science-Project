137,"00:19:54,670","00:19:57,638",the other way around?
138,"00:19:57,673","00:20:00,074",And life will go on.
139,"00:20:00,108","00:20:02,677",You should be
139,"00:20:00,108","00:20:02,677",The Hand of the King.
140,"00:20:02,711","00:20:05,546",That's an honor
140,"00:20:02,711","00:20:05,546",I can do without.
141,"00:20:05,581","00:20:07,715","Their days are too long,"
142,"00:20:07,749","00:20:10,017",their lives are too short.
143,"00:20:48,324","00:20:49,991",All these years
144,"00:20:50,026","00:20:51,693",and I still feel
144,"00:20:50,026","00:20:51,693",like an outsider
145,"00:20:51,727","00:20:53,962",when I come here.
146,"00:20:53,997","00:20:56,532",You have five
146,"00:20:53,997","00:20:56,532",northern children.
147,"00:20:56,566","00:20:59,801",You're not an outsider.
148,"00:20:59,836","00:21:02,771",I wonder
148,"00:20:59,836","00:21:02,771",if the old gods agree.
149,"00:21:03,873","00:21:06,775",It's your gods
149,"00:21:03,873","00:21:06,775",with all the rules.
150,"00:21:11,916","00:21:14,851","I am so sorry, my love."
151,"00:21:16,254","00:21:19,790",- Tell me.
151,"00:21:16,254","00:21:19,790",- There was a raven from King's Landing.
152,"00:21:21,660","00:21:23,361",Jon Arryn is dead.
153,"00:21:23,395","00:21:26,064",<i>A fever took him.</i>
154,"00:21:28,835","00:21:31,136",<i>I know he was like</i>
154,"00:21:28,835","00:21:31,136",<i>a father to you.</i>
155,"00:21:33,939","00:21:37,208","- <i>Your sister, the boy?</i>"
155,"00:21:33,939","00:21:37,208","- They both have their health,"
156,"00:21:37,242","00:21:39,410",<i>gods be good.</i>
157,"00:21:49,154","00:21:52,056",The raven
157,"00:21:49,154","00:21:52,056",brought more news...
158,"00:21:53,292","00:21:55,393",The King rides
158,"00:21:53,292","00:21:55,393",for Winterfell...
159,"00:21:55,428","00:21:57,128",with the Queen
160,"00:21:57,163","00:21:59,297",<i>and all the rest</i>
160,"00:21:57,163","00:21:59,297",<i>of them.</i>
161,"00:21:59,332","00:22:02,601",If he's coming
161,"00:21:59,332","00:22:02,601",this far north...
162,"00:22:03,971","00:22:06,172",There's only
162,"00:22:03,971","00:22:06,172",one thing he's after.
163,"00:22:06,206","00:22:09,242","You can always say no, Ned."
164,"00:22:17,952","00:22:21,689",We'll need plenty of candles
164,"00:22:17,952","00:22:21,689",for Lord Tyrion's chamber.
165,"00:22:21,723","00:22:23,657",I'm told he reads
165,"00:22:21,723","00:22:23,657",all night.
166,"00:22:23,692","00:22:25,593",I'm told he drinks
166,"00:22:23,692","00:22:25,593",all night.
167,"00:22:25,627","00:22:28,930",How much could he possibly drink?
167,"00:22:25,627","00:22:28,930",A man of his...
168,"00:22:28,964","00:22:30,731",Stature?
169,"00:22:30,766","00:22:33,435",We've brought up
169,"00:22:30,766","00:22:33,435",eight barrels of ale from the cellar.
170,"00:22:33,469","00:22:36,004",- Perhaps we'll find out.
170,"00:22:33,469","00:22:36,004","- In any case,"
171,"00:22:36,038","00:22:38,707",<i>candles.</i>
172,"00:22:42,813","00:22:45,882",Why is your mother so dead set
172,"00:22:42,813","00:22:45,882",on us getting pretty for the King?
173,"00:22:45,916","00:22:48,751","It's for the Queen, I bet."
173,"00:22:45,916","00:22:48,751",I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.
174,"00:22:48,786","00:22:50,887",I hear the prince
174,"00:22:48,786","00:22:50,887",is a right royal prick.
175,"00:22:50,921","00:22:52,955",Think of all those
175,"00:22:50,921","00:22:52,955",southern girls he gets to stab
176,"00:22:52,990","00:22:54,557",with his right
176,"00:22:52,990","00:22:54,557",royal prick.
177,"00:22:56,325","00:22:58,460","Go on, Tommy,"
177,"00:22:56,325","00:22:58,460",shear him good.
178,"00:22:58,494","00:23:00,963",He's never met a girl he likes better
178,"00:22:58,494","00:23:00,963",than his own hair.
179,"00:23:37,868","00:23:40,736","Gods, but they grow fast."
180,"00:23:43,106","00:23:44,573",Brandon!
181,"00:23:44,607","00:23:47,943",I saw the king.
181,"00:23:44,607","00:23:47,943",He's got hundreds of people.
182,"00:23:47,977","00:23:51,180",How many times
182,"00:23:47,977","00:23:51,180",have I told you no climbing?
183,"00:23:51,214","00:23:54,082",But he's coming right now--
183,"00:23:51,214","00:23:54,082",down our road.
184,"00:24:00,923","00:24:03,491",I want you
184,"00:24:00,923","00:24:03,491","to promise me,"
185,"00:24:03,526","00:24:05,293",no more climbing.
186,"00:24:09,698","00:24:11,299",I promise.
187,"00:24:13,569","00:24:16,539",- Do you know what?
187,"00:24:13,569","00:24:16,539",- What?
188,"00:24:16,573","00:24:18,874",You always look
188,"00:24:16,573","00:24:18,874",at your feet before you lie.
189,"00:24:21,545","00:24:24,914",Run and find your father.
189,"00:24:21,545","00:24:24,914",Tell him the King is close.
190,"00:25:09,027","00:25:12,730",Where's Arya?
190,"00:25:09,027","00:25:12,730","Sansa, where's your sister?"
191,"00:25:22,842","00:25:24,476",- Hey hey hey hey.
191,"00:25:22,842","00:25:24,476",- Ohh.
192,"00:25:24,510","00:25:26,811",What are you doing
192,"00:25:24,510","00:25:26,811",with that on?
193,"00:25:29,614","00:25:31,750",Go on.
194,"00:25:33,052","00:25:34,853",Move!
195,"00:26:56,867","00:26:58,868",Your Grace.
196,"00:27:02,874","00:27:04,975",You've got fat.
197,"00:27:17,054","00:27:19,689",- Cat!
197,"00:27:17,054","00:27:19,689",- Your Grace.
198,"00:27:22,893","00:27:25,961",Nine years-- why haven't I seen you?
198,"00:27:22,893","00:27:25,961",Where the hell have you been?
199,"00:27:25,995","00:27:27,896",Guarding the north
199,"00:27:25,995","00:27:27,896","for you, your Grace."

202,"00:27:36,207","00:27:38,909",Who have we here?
203,"00:27:38,943","00:27:40,711",You must be Robb.

264,"00:31:42,256","00:31:44,858",- Don't get up.
264,"00:31:42,256","00:31:44,858",- My Lord.
265,"00:31:44,892","00:31:47,227",Should I explain to you
265,"00:31:44,892","00:31:47,227",the meaning of a closed door
266,"00:31:47,261","00:31:50,998","- in a whorehouse, brother?"
266,"00:31:47,261","00:31:50,998","- You have much to teach me, no doubt,"
267,"00:31:51,032","00:31:54,668",but our sister craves
267,"00:31:51,032","00:31:54,668",your attention.
268,"00:31:54,702","00:31:56,804","She has odd cravings,"

284,"00:32:53,163","00:32:55,698",She belonged with me.
285,"00:33:01,071","00:33:04,340","In my dreams,"
285,"00:33:01,071","00:33:04,340",I kill him every night.

390,"00:41:29,983","00:41:32,851",- Father will let me if you ask him.
391,"00:41:32,885","00:41:35,086",I know he will.

395,"00:41:42,560","00:41:45,262",what you'd be giving up.
396,"00:41:45,296","00:41:47,764",We have no families.
397,"00:41:47,798","00:41:51,135",- None of us will ever father sons--
397,"00:41:47,798","00:41:51,135",- I don't care about that!
398,"00:41:52,337","00:41:54,805","You might, if you knew"
398,"00:41:52,337","00:41:54,805",what it meant.
399,"00:41:58,110","00:42:00,345","I'd better get inside,"
400,"00:42:00,379","00:42:03,048",rescue your father

410,"00:42:46,657","00:42:48,892",Did I offend you?
410,"00:42:46,657","00:42:48,892",Sorry.

425,"00:44:00,399","00:44:02,501",Just a lad.
426,"00:44:02,535","00:44:04,269","And he was tough, Ned,"

431,"00:44:17,250","00:44:20,419",A wildling ambush.
432,"00:44:20,453","00:44:22,087",Maybe.

438,"00:44:39,071","00:44:42,006",- Robb boy.
439,"00:44:42,040","00:44:43,641",- How are you?
439,"00:44:42,040","00:44:43,641",- I'm good.

449,"00:45:17,678","00:45:19,578","I think so, your Grace."
450,"00:45:19,613","00:45:21,847",And have you bled yet?

461,"00:46:12,601","00:46:14,102",a tournament
462,"00:46:14,137","00:46:16,104",to celebrate your new title--
462,"00:46:14,137","00:46:16,104",if you accept.
463,"00:46:16,139","00:46:18,341",It would be good

465,"00:46:20,577","00:46:23,313",- No?
466,"00:46:23,347","00:46:24,848",Getting
