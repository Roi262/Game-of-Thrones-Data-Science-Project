5;00:03:17,752;00:03:20,671;— You’re wearing a black cloak again.
6;00:03:20,722;00:03:23,557;— I’ve been sent to negotiate with you.
7;00:03:52,253;00:03:54,922;— It appears my trusting nature got the better of me.
8;00:03:54,956;00:03:57,174;— It’s happened before.
9;00:03:57,208;00:04:01,011;— I was hoping your loyalty was real when
9;00:03:57,208;00:04:01,011;you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow.
10;00:04:01,046;00:04:02,796;— Truly I was.
11;00:04:02,847;00:04:04,682;— The Halfhand ordered me to join your army
12;00:04:04,716;00:04:07,468;— and bring back whatever information
12;00:04:04,716;00:04:07,468;I could to Castle Black.
13;00:04:07,519;00:04:09,970;— He made me kill him so you’d trust me.
14;00:04:10,021;00:04:11,605;— I was loyal…
15;00:04:11,639;00:04:14,274;— to him and to my Night’s Watch vows.
16;00:04:14,309;00:04:16,226;— All your vows?
17;00:04:18,530;00:04:21,982;— She wasn’t enough to turn you, eh?
18;00:04:22,033;00:04:24,151;— Were you enough to turn her?
19;00:04:24,202;00:04:26,987;— She put three arrows in me
20;00:04:26,989;00:04:29,073;— when I escaped.
21;00:04:30,875;00:04:32,659;— Did you see her again at Castle Black?
22;00:04:32,711;00:04:35,913;— Yes.
22;00:04:32,711;00:04:35,913;— And?
23;00:04:35,964;00:04:38,132;— She’s dead.
24;00:04:39,300;00:04:42,503;— Your doing?
24;00:04:39,300;00:04:42,503;— No.
25;00:04:44,506;00:04:46,006;— We’ll drink to her.
26;00:05:09,414;00:05:11,582;— Of all the ways I’d kill you,
27;00:05:11,616;00:05:14,034;— poison would be the last.
28;00:05:17,172;00:05:19,423;— Ygritte.

31;00:05:30,185;00:05:33,220;— No, it’s a proper northern drink, Jon Snow.
32;00:05:33,222;00:05:36,440;— You did well. Fought hard.
33;00:05:36,474;00:05:38,559;— Killed some of our strongest men.
34;00:05:38,561;00:05:41,311;— One of our giants went into your tunnel
35;00:05:41,362;00:05:43,614;— and never came out again.
36;00:05:43,648;00:05:45,566;— Mag the Mighty.
37;00:05:45,617;00:05:47,451;— He’s dead.
38;00:05:47,485;00:05:49,620;— He killed my friend Grenn.
39;00:05:49,654;00:05:51,038;— He was their king.
40;00:05:51,072;00:05:53,707;— The last of a bloodline that stretches back
41;00:05:53,741;00:05:55,793;— before the First Men.
42;00:05:55,827;00:05:57,744;— Grenn came from a farm.
43;00:06:01,916;00:06:04,918;— Mag and Grenn.
43;00:06:01,916;00:06:04,918;— Grenn and Mag.
44;00:06:07,639;00:06:10,257;— Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat?
45;00:06:10,308;00:06:13,227;— I don’t imagine our guest has eaten anything
46;00:06:13,261;00:06:15,095;— for quite some time.
47;00:06:16,314;00:06:20,400;— So, you’re here to strike a bargain?
48;00:06:21,769;00:06:24,154;— Turn your army around and go home.
49;00:06:24,189;00:06:26,440;— You know I know you’re low on arrows,
50;00:06:26,442;00:06:28,522;— you’re low on oil, you’re low on men.
51;00:06:28,526;00:06:30,410;— How many are left, 50?
52;00:06:30,445;00:06:32,446;— I told Tormund and Orell.
53;00:06:32,448;00:06:34,198;— We have more than 1,000 men.
54;00:06:34,249;00:06:35,999;— I showed you everything I had.
55;00:06:36,034;00:06:37,835;— The whole army, 100,000 strong.
56;00:06:37,869;00:06:41,121;— And what did you do? You fired
56;00:06:37,869;00:06:41,121;on us with everything you had.
57;00:06:41,123;00:06:43,790;— It wasn’t much. As soon as I saw that,
58;00:06:43,842;00:06:47,127;— I sent 400 men to climb the Wall,
59;00:06:47,178;00:06:49,546;— an unmanned stretch five miles west of here.
60;00:06:49,597;00:06:51,465;— A lot of them will die climbing,
61;00:06:51,516;00:06:53,517;— but most of them will be over by the end of the day.
62;00:06:53,551;00:06:56,803;— It’s me being honest with you, Jon Snow,
63;00:06:56,805;00:06:59,306;— which is more than you’ve ever done for me.
64;00:06:59,357;00:07:01,141;— My people have bled enough.
65;00:07:01,192;00:07:02,976;— We’re not here to conquer.
66;00:07:03,027;00:07:06,029;— We’re here to hide behind your Wall.
67;00:07:06,064;00:07:10,317;— Just like you. We need your tunnel.
68;00:07:10,319;00:07:13,537;— Now we both know that winter is coming.
69;00:07:13,571;00:07:17,157;— And if my people aren’t south of
69;00:07:13,571;00:07:17,157;the Wall when it comes in earnest,
70;00:07:17,208;00:07:19,159;— we’ll all end up worse than dead.
71;00:07:19,161;00:07:22,045;— You want to strike a bargain with me?
72;00:07:22,080;00:07:23,547;— Here’s the bargain.
73;00:07:23,581;00:07:25,999;— You go back, you open the gates to us,
74;00:07:26,050;00:07:29,336;— and I swear to you that no one else will die.
75;00:07:29,387;00:07:31,672;— Refuse,
76;00:07:31,723;00:07:34,558;— and we’ll kill every last man at Castle Black.
77;00:07:36,761;00:07:37,928;— Ah!
78;00:07:40,732;00:07:44,985;— Oh, that’s why you’re here.
79;00:07:45,019;00:07:48,655;— I reckon you could do it before
79;00:07:45,019;00:07:48,655;any of them could stop you.
80;00:07:48,690;00:07:50,657;— They’d kill you, of course.
81;00:07:50,692;00:07:51,932;— They’d kill you slow.
82;00:07:51,943;00:07:55,195;— But you knew that when you came in here.
83;00:07:56,364;00:07:59,449;— Are you capable of that, Jon Snow?
84;00:07:59,500;00:08:03,370;— Killing a man in his own tent
84;00:07:59,500;00:08:03,370;when he’s just offered you peace?
85;00:08:03,421;00:08:05,422;— Is that what the Night’s Watch is?
86;00:08:05,456;00:08:07,874;— Is that what you are?
87;00:08:10,678;00:08:14,047;—  (horn blows)
87;00:08:10,678;00:08:14,047;— Man: Riders coming!
88;00:08:14,082;00:08:15,716;— Are you attacking us?
88;00:08:14,082;00:08:15,716;— No.
89;00:08:15,718;00:08:17,718;— It’s like you said, we don’t have the men.
90;00:08:17,720;00:08:20,470;—  (horn blowing)
90;00:08:17,720;00:08:20,470;—  (dogs barking)

95;00:09:59,987;00:10:02,122;— Stand down!
96;00:10:03,574;00:10:05,876;— I said my people have bled enough
97;00:10:05,910;00:10:08,245;— and I meant it.
98;00:10:36,607;00:10:38,492;(shouting)
99;00:10:42,196;00:10:44,197;Man: — Round them up.
100;00:10:44,199;00:10:45,866;— Stay with the horses.
101;00:10:55,376;00:10:57,761;— You’re the King-beyond-the-Wall?
102;00:11:00,381;00:11:03,049;— Do you know who I am?
102;00:11:00,381;00:11:03,049;— Never had the pleasure.
103;00:11:03,051;00:11:04,468;— This is Stannis Baratheon,
104;00:11:04,519;00:11:06,269;— the one true king of the Seven Kingdoms.
105;00:11:06,304;00:11:09,344;— We’re not in the Seven Kingdoms and
105;00:11:06,304;00:11:09,344;you’re not dressed for this weather.
106;00:11:10,641;00:11:13,777;— It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.
107;00:11:20,118;00:11:22,035;— We do not kneel.
108;00:11:22,069;00:11:24,571;— I’ll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall,
109;00:11:24,573;00:11:26,790;— have nowhere to put them, have nothing to feed them.
110;00:11:26,824;00:11:29,793;— I’m not here to slaughter beat dogs.
111;00:11:29,827;00:11:33,130;— Their fate depends on their king.
112;00:11:33,164;00:11:37,134;— All the same, we do not kneel.
113;00:11:39,754;00:11:42,422;— Take these men away.
114;00:11:42,424;00:11:45,175;— What’s a man of the Night’s
114;00:11:42,424;00:11:45,175;Watch doing in a wildling camp?
115;00:11:47,094;00:11:49,930;— I was sent to discuss terms
115;00:11:47,094;00:11:49,930;with the King-beyond-the-Wall.
116;00:11:49,981;00:11:51,621;— You’re speaking to the one true king, boy.
117;00:11:51,649;00:11:54,151;— You will address him as Your Grace.
118;00:11:54,185;00:11:57,487;— I know he’s the king. My father died for him.
119;00:11:59,690;00:12:02,192;— My name is Jon Snow, Your Grace.
120;00:12:02,243;00:12:04,578;— I’m Ned Stark’s son.
121;00:12:06,948;00:12:09,583;— Your father was an honorable man.
122;00:12:09,617;00:12:11,501;— He was, Your Grace.
123;00:12:11,536;00:12:13,737;— What do you think he’d have done with him?
124;00:12:19,343;00:12:21,795;— I was this man’s prisoner once.
125;00:12:21,846;00:12:25,098;— He could have tortured me. He could have killed me.
126;00:12:26,300;00:12:28,718;— But he spared my life.
127;00:12:28,769;00:12:30,971;— I think my father would have taken him prisoner,
128;00:12:30,973;00:12:33,056;— listened to what he had to say.
129;00:12:36,611;00:12:38,728;— Very well, then. Take him.
130;00:12:44,869;00:12:47,070;— Your Grace.
131;00:12:47,121;00:12:49,873;— If my father had seen the things that I’ve seen,
132;00:12:49,907;00:12:53,293;— he’d also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall.
133;00:12:54,579;00:12:56,329;— All of them.
134;00:13:02,003;00:13:05,005;(flies buzzing)
135;00:13:05,056;00:13:07,674;— I would suggest milk of the poppy
136;00:13:07,725;00:13:10,343;— to ease his pain, but he is completely insensate.
137;00:13:10,394;00:13:11,811;— Bloody Martells.
138;00:13:11,846;00:13:13,847;— The cause appears to be manticore venom.
139;00:13:13,898;00:13:16,182;— It is. The Death’s Head manticore.
140;00:13:16,234;00:13:19,853;— Yes, I’ve read a great deal about it.
141;00:13:19,904;00:13:21,855;— It’s a horrible poison.
142;00:13:21,857;00:13:24,574;— Usually Mantari in origin.
143;00:13:24,609;00:13:26,493;— Oh! Yes, yes.
144;00:13:26,527;00:13:28,028;— There’s nothing to be done.
145;00:13:28,030;00:13:29,496;— Yes, there is.
146;00:13:30,865;00:13:33,867;— May I ask what you think you’re doing?
147;00:13:33,918;00:13:35,285;— Saving him.
148;00:13:35,336;00:13:37,254;— Your Grace, I wish it were otherwise,
149;00:13:37,288;00:13:39,706;— but Ser Gregor is beyond saving.
150;00:13:39,708;00:13:42,259;— Well, well beyond.
151;00:13:42,293;00:13:44,878;— This man is not even a maester,
152;00:13:44,880;00:13:46,713;— let alone Grand Maester.
153;00:13:46,764;00:13:48,465;— That’s for the best.
154;00:13:48,516;00:13:49,883;— No maester knows how to save him.
155;00:13:49,885;00:13:52,018;— That is exactly the sort of arrogance
156;00:13:52,053;00:13:55,021;— that had him expelled from the Citadel, Your Grace.
157;00:13:55,056;00:13:58,892;— His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural.
158;00:13:58,943;00:14:01,144;— Rightly so, in my opinion.
159;00:14:01,195;00:14:03,730;— You’re dismissed, Grand Maester.
160;00:14:05,399;00:14:09,286;— But, Your Grace, this is my laboratory.
161;00:14:09,320;00:14:12,072;— Not anymore.
161;00:14:09,320;00:14:12,072;Pycelle: — But I…

164;00:14:19,046;00:14:22,082;— Difficult to say, Your Grace.
165;00:14:22,133;00:14:24,374;— But if my past work is any guide…

169;00:14:30,591;00:14:32,258;— Come to me for anything you need.
170;00:14:32,260;00:14:33,760;— Thank you, Your Grace.
171;00:14:33,811;00:14:35,729;— You should know,
172;00:14:35,763;00:14:38,815;— the process may change him…
173;00:14:39,817;00:14:41,935;— somewhat.
174;00:14:44,105;00:14:46,056;— Will it weaken him?
175;00:14:47,191;00:14:48,775;— Oh, no.
176;00:14:48,826;00:14:50,944;— Very well, then.
177;00:15:09,296;00:15:11,297;Tywin: — Not another word.
178;00:15:11,299;00:15:13,800;— We’ve been over this. The matter’s closed.
179;00:15:13,802;00:15:16,886;— I’m opening it again.
180;00:15:16,937;00:15:19,973;— You were betrothed to Loras Tyrell.
181;00:15:20,024;00:15:22,525;— You’re still betrothed to Loras Tyrell.
182;00:15:22,560;00:15:24,644;— And you will marry Loras Tyrell
183;00:15:24,695;00:15:26,980;— as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.
184;00:15:27,064;00:15:28,398;— I will not.
185;00:15:28,449;00:15:31,434;— Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands.
186;00:15:31,469;00:15:34,710;— Tyrion’s sentence will be carried out tomorrow.
187;00:15:36,490;00:15:39,826;— You have on several occasions made great claims
188;00:15:39,828;00:15:42,495;— about your commitment to this family’s future.
189;00:15:42,546;00:15:44,381;— Your role in that future
190;00:15:44,415;00:15:46,583;— is more vital now than it ever was.
191;00:15:46,634;00:15:48,501;— I don’t care.
192;00:15:48,552;00:15:51,971;— I will stay in King’s Landing where
192;00:15:48,552;00:15:51,971;I belong with my son the king.
193;00:15:52,006;00:15:55,225;— When you were nine years old,
193;00:15:52,006;00:15:55,225;I was called to the capital.
194;00:15:55,259;00:15:58,011;— I decided to take your
194;00:15:55,259;00:15:58,011;brother with me and not you.
195;00:15:58,045;00:16:01,564;— You insisted that you would
195;00:15:58,045;00:16:01,564;not be left at Casterly Rock
196;00:16:01,599;00:16:04,401;— under any circumstances. And if you recall–
197;00:16:04,435;00:16:06,519;— I’m not interested in hearing
197;00:16:04,435;00:16:06,519;another one of your smug stories
198;00:16:06,570;00:16:08,738;— about the time you won.
199;00:16:08,773;00:16:10,740;— This isn’t going to be one of those times.
200;00:16:10,775;00:16:12,826;— Do you think you’ll be the first person
201;00:16:12,860;00:16:15,912;— dragged into a sept to be married against her will?
202;00:16:15,946;00:16:17,914;— When you marched into the throne room to tell me
203;00:16:17,948;00:16:21,149;— we’d won the Battle of Blackwater… Do you remember?
204;00:16:22,503;00:16:25,588;— I was sitting on the Iron Throne with Tommen.
205;00:16:25,623;00:16:27,290;— I was about to give him essence of nightshade.
206;00:16:27,341;00:16:29,209;— That’s how far I was willing to go when I thought
207;00:16:29,260;00:16:32,011;— someone awful had come to take my son away.
208;00:16:34,048;00:16:36,433;— Someone awful is coming to take him away.
209;00:16:36,467;00:16:38,635;— No.
209;00:16:36,467;00:16:38,635;— Joffrey is dead.
210;00:16:38,686;00:16:41,054;— Myrcella’s been sold like livestock.
211;00:16:41,105;00:16:44,057;— And now you want to ship me off
211;00:16:41,105;00:16:44,057;to Highgarden and steal my boy.
212;00:16:44,108;00:16:46,526;— My last boy.
213;00:16:46,560;00:16:48,561;— Margaery will dig her claws in,
214;00:16:48,612;00:16:51,030;— you will dig your claws in
214;00:16:48,612;00:16:51,030;and you’ll fight over him
215;00:16:51,065;00:16:53,233;— like beasts until you rip him apart.
216;00:16:53,235;00:16:56,986;— I will burn our house to the
216;00:16:53,235;00:16:56,986;ground before I let that happen.
217;00:16:57,037;00:17:00,073;— And how will you do that?
218;00:17:00,075;00:17:03,076;— I’ll tell everyone the truth.
219;00:17:03,078;00:17:05,245;— What truth would that be?
220;00:17:10,000;00:17:11,417;— You don’t know, do you?
221;00:17:13,554;00:17:16,005;— You never believed it.
222;00:17:16,974;00:17:19,092;— How is that possible?
223;00:17:20,561;00:17:23,179;— What am I saying? Of course it’s possible.
224;00:17:23,230;00:17:26,983;— How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family
225;00:17:27,017;00:17:30,017;— have any conception what his actual family was doing?
226;00:17:31,438;00:17:34,324;— We were right there in front
226;00:17:31,438;00:17:34,324;of you and you didn’t see us.
227;00:17:34,358;00:17:36,493;— One look in the past 20 years,
228;00:17:36,527;00:17:39,496;— one real look at your own children
228;00:17:36,527;00:17:39,496;and you would have known.
229;00:17:39,530;00:17:42,031;— Known what?
230;00:17:42,082;00:17:44,450;— Everything they say is true.
231;00:17:44,502;00:17:46,119;— About Jaime and me.
231;00:17:44,502;00:17:46,119;— No.
232;00:17:46,121;00:17:48,922;— Your legacy is a lie.
232;00:17:46,121;00:17:48,922;— No, no, no, no.
233;00:17:48,956;00:17:51,791;— I don’t believe you.
234;00:17:54,929;00:17:56,963;— Yes, you do.
235;00:18:14,064;00:18:16,816;— Jaime.
236;00:18:16,818;00:18:19,068;— You won.
237;00:18:19,119;00:18:21,871;— One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself.
238;00:18:21,906;00:18:24,207;— There’s really nothing you wouldn’t do, is there?
239;00:18:24,241;00:18:25,992;— For my family, no, nothing.
240;00:18:25,994;00:18:28,378;— I would do things for my
240;00:18:25,994;00:18:28,378;family you couldn’t imagine.
241;00:18:28,412;00:18:30,914;— Tyrion is your family.
241;00:18:28,412;00:18:30,914;— He’s not.
242;00:18:30,965;00:18:33,833;— You don’t get to choose.
242;00:18:30,965;00:18:33,833;— I do. So do you.
243;00:18:33,835;00:18:37,170;— You can choose the creature that killed
243;00:18:33,835;00:18:37,170;our mother to come into this world–
244;00:18:37,221;00:18:39,505;— Are you really mad enough to blame him for that?
245;00:18:39,557;00:18:42,425;— He didn’t decide to kill her. He was an infant.
246;00:18:42,476;00:18:44,310;— A disease doesn’t decide to kill you.
247;00:18:44,345;00:18:47,063;— All the same, you cut it out before it does.
248;00:18:47,097;00:18:50,066;— What do you decide? What do you choose?
249;00:18:50,100;00:18:51,601;— The things I did to get back to you,
250;00:18:51,652;00:18:54,520;— to endure all that, only to find you–
251;00:18:57,441;00:18:59,492;— I choose you.
252;00:18:59,526;00:19:01,160;— Those are words.
252;00:18:59,526;00:19:01,160;— Yes.
253;00:19:01,195;00:19:03,496;— Like the ones I just said to Father.
254;00:19:04,615;00:19:06,199;— I told him.
255;00:19:06,250;00:19:08,084;— Told him what?
256;00:19:08,118;00:19:10,169;— I told him about us.
257;00:19:11,422;00:19:12,872;— You told him?
258;00:19:12,874;00:19:14,924;— I told him I won’t marry Loras Tyrell.
259;00:19:14,959;00:19:18,628;— I told him I’m staying right here
259;00:19:14,959;00:19:18,628;with Tommen, with you.
260;00:19:18,679;00:19:20,096;— You think he’ll just accept that?
261;00:19:20,130;00:19:24,523;— Go and ask him.
262;00:19:24,525;00:19:25,825;— What did you say?
263;00:19:25,859;00:19:28,194;— I don’t want to talk about Tywin Lannister.
264;00:19:28,196;00:19:30,830;— I don’t choose Tywin Lannister.
265;00:19:30,864;00:19:32,615;— I don’t love Tywin Lannister.
266;00:19:32,666;00:19:34,867;— I love my brother.
267;00:19:34,918;00:19:36,836;— I love my lover.
268;00:19:38,121;00:19:40,289;— People will whisper, they’ll make their jokes.
269;00:19:40,340;00:19:41,707;— Let them.
270;00:19:41,709;00:19:44,376;— They’re all so small, I can’t even see them.
271;00:19:44,427;00:19:46,679;— I only see what matters.
272;00:19:55,555;00:19:57,022;— Someone will walk in.
273;00:19:57,057;00:19:58,557;— I don’t care.
274;00:20:07,200;00:20:10,402;—
275;00:20:10,522;00:20:11,707;—
276;00:20:11,827;00:20:13,317;—
277;00:20:13,557;00:20:17,125;—
278;00:20:17,711;00:20:20,193;—
279;00:20:20,746;00:20:23,662;—
280;00:20:24,134;00:20:30,358;—
281;00:20:35,182;00:20:38,347;— I can speak the common tongue if you wish.
282;00:20:38,398;00:20:39,982;— You speak it very well.
283;00:20:40,016;00:20:43,936;— Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal.
284;00:20:43,938;00:20:45,988;— I was tutor to his children.
285;00:20:46,022;00:20:48,023;— I taught them languages and history.
286;00:20:48,074;00:20:52,111;— They know a great deal about your family because of me.
287;00:20:52,162;00:20:55,281;— Little Calla is only seven,
288;00:20:55,315;00:20:57,666;— but she admires you very much.
289;00:20:57,701;00:21:00,486;— I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration.
290;00:21:00,520;00:21:02,838;— What can I do for you?
291;00:21:04,291;00:21:06,709;— When you took the city, the children begged me
292;00:21:06,760;00:21:09,295;— not to leave the house.
293;00:21:09,297;00:21:13,048;— But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must.
294;00:21:13,099;00:21:15,935;— So I lost my home.
295;00:21:17,804;00:21:19,855;— Now I live on the streets.
296;00:21:19,889;00:21:21,473;— I have outfitted mess halls
297;00:21:21,524;00:21:23,976;— to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.
298;00:21:24,027;00:21:26,745;— I do not mean to offend, Your Grace.
299;00:21:26,780;00:21:29,615;— I went to one of these places.
300;00:21:29,649;00:21:31,951;— The young prey on the old.
301;00:21:31,985;00:21:35,504;— Take what they want and beat us if we resist.
302;00:21:35,538;00:21:37,856;— My Unsullied will make them
302;00:21:35,538;00:21:37,856;safe again in short order,
303;00:21:37,891;00:21:39,625;— my friend, this I promise you.
304;00:21:39,659;00:21:43,429;— Even if they are safe, who would I be there?
305;00:21:43,463;00:21:46,165;— What purpose would I serve?
306;00:21:46,216;00:21:49,635;— With my master, I was a teacher.
307;00:21:49,669;00:21:53,505;— I had the respect and love of his children.
308;00:21:53,507;00:21:55,541;— What is it that you want from me?
309;00:21:55,575;00:21:58,560;— Your Grace, I ask you
310;00:21:58,595;00:22:01,563;— to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal.
311;00:22:01,598;00:22:04,149;— You want to return to a man who owned you
312;00:22:04,184;00:22:06,685;— like a goat or a chair?
313;00:22:06,736;00:22:08,437;— Please, Your Grace.
314;00:22:08,488;00:22:11,440;— The young may rejoice in the new
314;00:22:08,488;00:22:11,440;world you have built for them,
315;00:22:11,491;00:22:14,493;— but for those of us too old to change,
316;00:22:14,527;00:22:18,597;— there is only fear and squalor.
317;00:22:19,532;00:22:21,533;— I am not alone.
318;00:22:21,535;00:22:25,170;— There are many outside waiting to beg the same of you.
319;00:22:25,205;00:22:27,089;— I did not take this city to preside
320;00:22:27,123;00:22:29,541;— over the injustice I fought to destroy.
321;00:22:29,592;00:22:33,270;— I took it to bring people freedom.
322;00:22:33,304;00:22:36,723;— But freedom means making your own choices.
323;00:22:36,774;00:22:40,694;— I will allow you to sign a
323;00:22:36,774;00:22:40,694;contract with your former master.
324;00:22:40,728;00:22:44,231;— It may not cover a period
324;00:22:40,728;00:22:44,231;lasting longer than a year.
325;00:22:44,233;00:22:46,566;— Thank you, Your Grace.
326;00:22:48,403;00:22:50,070;— Thank you.
327;00:22:55,209;00:22:58,569;— The masters will take advantage of this situation.
328;00:22:59,464;00:23:01,248;— The men serving them
329;00:23:01,250;00:23:03,884;— will be slaves in all but name.
330;00:23:10,591;00:23:12,893;— Approach, my friend.
331;00:23:18,802;00:23:20,523;—
332;00:23:22,869;00:23:24,403;—
333;00:23:24,523;00:23:26,940;—
334;00:23:32,764;00:23:34,781;(sobbing)
335;00:23:34,832;00:23:37,033;(speaking low Valyrian)
336;00:23:37,085;00:23:39,169;Missandei: — I have brought you–
337;00:23:43,357;00:23:45,292;— He came from the sky.
338;00:23:47,011;00:23:49,296;— The black one.
339;00:23:52,967;00:23:54,935;— The winged shadow.
340;00:23:56,304;00:23:58,638;— He came from the sky and…
341;00:24:04,028;00:24:06,229;— My girl.
342;00:24:06,280;00:24:07,898;— My little girl.
343;00:24:07,949;00:24:10,484;(sobbing)
344;00:24:12,987;00:24:14,204;Daenerys: — What was her name?
345;00:24:14,238;00:24:16,289;Missandei: — Zala, Your Grace.
346;00:24:16,324;00:24:19,493;— How old was she?
346;00:24:16,324;00:24:19,493;— Three.
347;00:24:19,495;00:24:21,661;— Three.
348;00:24:23,831;00:24:26,500;—
349;00:24:28,443;00:24:33,408;—
