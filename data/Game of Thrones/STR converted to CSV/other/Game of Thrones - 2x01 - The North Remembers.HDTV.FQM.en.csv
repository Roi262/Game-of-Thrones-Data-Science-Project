623;00:40:16,996;00:40:18,563;nor any of his men
624;00:40:18,598;00:40:20,832;shall set foot
624;00:40:18,598;00:40:20,832;in our lands again.
625;00:40:20,900;00:40:22,767;If he disregards
625;00:40:20,900;00:40:22,767;this command,
626;00:40:22,802;00:40:26,338;he shall suffer
626;00:40:22,802;00:40:26,338;the same fate as my father,
627;00:40:26,372;00:40:30,675;only I don't need a servant
627;00:40:26,372;00:40:30,675;to do my beheading for me.
628;00:40:30,709;00:40:34,212;These are-- Your Grace,
628;00:40:30,709;00:40:34,212;these are--
629;00:40:34,246;00:40:36,781;these are my terms.
630;00:40:36,815;00:40:39,951;If the Queen Regent and her son
630;00:40:36,815;00:40:39,951;meet them, I'll give them peace.
631;00:40:39,985;00:40:42,954;If not...
632;00:40:42,988;00:40:45,423;I will litter the south
632;00:40:42,988;00:40:45,423;with Lannister dead.
633;00:40:45,458;00:40:48,360;King Joffrey is a Baratheon,
633;00:40:45,458;00:40:48,360;Your Grace.
634;00:40:48,394;00:40:50,195;Oh, is he?
635;00:40:51,398;00:40:54,733;You'll ride at daybreak,
635;00:40:51,398;00:40:54,733;Ser Alton.
636;00:40:54,768;00:40:57,402;That will be all
636;00:40:54,768;00:40:57,402;for tonight.
637;00:41:12,151;00:41:14,286;A word, Your Grace?
638;00:41:16,055;00:41:18,790;You don't have to call me
638;00:41:16,055;00:41:18,790;Your Grace when no one's around.
639;00:41:18,824;00:41:21,527;It's not so bad
639;00:41:18,824;00:41:21,527;once you get used to it.
640;00:41:21,561;00:41:23,395;I'm glad someone's
640;00:41:21,561;00:41:23,395;gotten used to it.
641;00:41:23,429;00:41:26,765;The Lannisters are going to reject
641;00:41:23,429;00:41:26,765;your terms, you know?
642;00:41:26,799;00:41:28,500;Of course they are.
643;00:41:28,534;00:41:30,869;We can fight them
643;00:41:28,534;00:41:30,869;in the fields as long as you like,
644;00:41:30,903;00:41:34,606;but we won't beat them until you
644;00:41:30,903;00:41:34,606;take King's Landing.
645;00:41:36,142;00:41:39,278;And we can't take
645;00:41:36,142;00:41:39,278;King's Landing without ships.
646;00:41:39,312;00:41:41,947;My father has ships and men
646;00:41:39,312;00:41:41,947;who know how to sail them.
647;00:41:41,982;00:41:43,749;Men who fought
647;00:41:41,982;00:41:43,749;my father.
648;00:41:43,784;00:41:46,218;Men who fought King Robert
648;00:41:43,784;00:41:46,218;to free themselves
649;00:41:46,252;00:41:50,056;from the yoke of the South,
649;00:41:46,252;00:41:50,056;just like you're doing now.
650;00:41:51,224;00:41:54,294;I'm his only living son.
651;00:41:54,328;00:41:57,464;He'll listen to me.
651;00:41:54,328;00:41:57,464;I know he will.
652;00:41:59,900;00:42:03,169;I'm not a Stark.
652;00:41:59,900;00:42:03,169;I know that.
653;00:42:03,204;00:42:06,173;But your father raised me
653;00:42:03,204;00:42:06,173;to be an honorable man.
654;00:42:07,942;00:42:10,444;We can avenge him
654;00:42:07,942;00:42:10,444;together.
655;00:42:11,746;00:42:14,715;You don't want
655;00:42:11,746;00:42:14,715;Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
656;00:42:14,749;00:42:17,017;I need his ships.
656;00:42:14,749;00:42:17,017;They say he has 200.
657;00:42:17,052;00:42:20,621;They say a million rats
657;00:42:17,052;00:42:20,621;live in the sewers of King's Landing.
658;00:42:20,655;00:42:22,590;Shall we rally them
658;00:42:20,655;00:42:22,590;to fight for us?
659;00:42:22,624;00:42:24,458;I understand you don't
659;00:42:22,624;00:42:24,458;trust Lord Greyjoy.
660;00:42:24,493;00:42:29,163;I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because
660;00:42:24,493;00:42:29,163;he is not trustworthy.
661;00:42:29,197;00:42:31,832;Your father had to go to war
661;00:42:29,197;00:42:31,832;to end his rebellion.
662;00:42:31,867;00:42:35,737;Yes. And now I'm the one
662;00:42:31,867;00:42:35,737;rebelling against the throne.
663;00:42:35,771;00:42:38,039;Before me, it was father.
664;00:42:38,073;00:42:39,740;You married one rebel
664;00:42:38,073;00:42:39,740;and mothered another.
665;00:42:39,774;00:42:42,777;I mothered more than
665;00:42:39,774;00:42:42,777;just rebels,
666;00:42:42,811;00:42:45,145;a fact you seem
666;00:42:42,811;00:42:45,145;to have forgotten.
667;00:42:45,180;00:42:47,181;If I trade the Kingslayer
667;00:42:45,180;00:42:47,181;for two girls,
668;00:42:47,215;00:42:49,482;my bannermen will string me up
668;00:42:47,215;00:42:49,482;by my feet.
669;00:42:49,517;00:42:52,686;You want to leave Sansa
669;00:42:49,517;00:42:52,686;in the Queen's hands?
670;00:42:52,720;00:42:54,788;And Arya--
671;00:42:54,822;00:42:57,824;I haven't heard
671;00:42:54,822;00:42:57,824;a word about Arya.
672;00:42:57,859;00:42:59,593;What are we fighting for
672;00:42:57,859;00:42:59,593;if not for them?
673;00:42:59,627;00:43:01,228;It's more complicated
673;00:42:59,627;00:43:01,228;than that!
674;00:43:01,262;00:43:03,397;You know it is.
675;00:43:17,847;00:43:21,450;It's time for me
675;00:43:17,847;00:43:21,450;to go home.
676;00:43:21,484;00:43:24,386;I haven't seen Bran
676;00:43:21,484;00:43:24,386;or Rickon in months.
677;00:43:25,355;00:43:28,057;You can't go
677;00:43:25,355;00:43:28,057;to Winterfell.
678;00:43:28,091;00:43:30,059;I beg your pardon?
679;00:43:30,093;00:43:33,228;I'll send Rodrik
679;00:43:30,093;00:43:33,228;to watch over the boys
680;00:43:33,263;00:43:37,799;because tomorrow
680;00:43:33,263;00:43:37,799;you'll ride south to the Stormlands.
681;00:43:37,833;00:43:39,834;Why in the name
681;00:43:37,833;00:43:39,834;of all the Gods--
682;00:43:39,868;00:43:43,771;because I need you to negotiate
682;00:43:39,868;00:43:43,771;with Renly Baratheon.
683;00:43:43,806;00:43:45,940;He's rallied
683;00:43:43,806;00:43:45,940;an army of 100,000.
684;00:43:45,975;00:43:47,709;You know him.
684;00:43:45,975;00:43:47,709;You know his family.
685;00:43:47,743;00:43:50,177;I haven't seen Renly Baratheon
685;00:43:47,743;00:43:50,177;since he was a boy.
686;00:43:50,212;00:43:51,746;You have a hundred
686;00:43:50,212;00:43:51,746;other lords--
687;00:43:51,780;00:43:55,650;Which of these lords
687;00:43:51,780;00:43:55,650;do I trust more than you?
688;00:43:55,684;00:43:58,486;If Renly sides with us,
689;00:43:58,521;00:44:00,955;we'll outnumber them
689;00:43:58,521;00:44:00,955;two to one.
690;00:44:00,989;00:44:03,925;When they feel the jaws beginning
690;00:44:00,989;00:44:03,925;to shut, they'll sue for peace.
691;00:44:03,959;00:44:06,694;We'll get the girls back.
692;00:44:06,728;00:44:10,231;Then we'll all
692;00:44:06,728;00:44:10,231;go home... for good.

693;00:44:17,339;00:44:20,308;I will ride at first light.
694;00:44:28,951;00:44:32,553;We will all be together
694;00:44:28,951;00:44:32,553;again soon, I promise.
695;00:44:37,559;00:44:40,160;You've done so well.
696;00:44:41,463;00:44:45,332;Your father
696;00:44:41,463;00:44:45,332;would be... proud.
697;00:44:53,075;00:44:56,077;Give Lord Renly my regards.
697;00:44:53,075;00:44:56,077;King Renly.
698;00:44:57,413;00:45:00,182;There's a king
698;00:44:57,413;00:45:00,182;in every corner now.
699;00:45:01,918;00:45:04,820;( Hammering )
700;00:45:13,129;00:45:15,663;What is all this?
701;00:45:15,698;00:45:17,966;Returning this room
701;00:45:15,698;00:45:17,966;to its proper appearance.
702;00:45:18,000;00:45:20,868;Say what you will about the Targaryens--
702;00:45:18,000;00:45:20,868;they were conquerors.
703;00:45:20,903;00:45:23,738;That is a seat
703;00:45:20,903;00:45:23,738;for a conqueror.
704;00:45:23,772;00:45:27,441;It needs a room to match it,
704;00:45:23,772;00:45:27,441;not vines and flowers.
705;00:45:27,475;00:45:29,843;We can't find Arya Stark.
706;00:45:29,878;00:45:32,012;With luck, she's dead
706;00:45:29,878;00:45:32,012;in a ditch somewhere.
707;00:45:32,046;00:45:34,014;Perhaps. But if not,
707;00:45:32,046;00:45:34,014;we need her.
708;00:45:34,048;00:45:36,383;They'll never give Jaime back
708;00:45:34,048;00:45:36,383;to us for Sansa alone.
709;00:45:36,418;00:45:39,019;I think they might.
709;00:45:36,418;00:45:39,019;They're weak.
710;00:45:39,054;00:45:40,888;They put too much value
710;00:45:39,054;00:45:40,888;on their women.
711;00:45:40,922;00:45:44,758;We need to set our armies
711;00:45:40,922;00:45:44,758;to the task of finding her.
712;00:45:44,793;00:45:46,660;Send out as many men
712;00:45:44,793;00:45:46,660;as we can.
713;00:45:46,695;00:45:48,496;I'm sure if you asked

716;00:45:55,470;00:45:58,372;is the reason Robb Stark has
716;00:45:55,470;00:45:58,372;Uncle Jaime in the first place.
717;00:45:58,406;00:46:01,107;His life is in danger.
718;00:46:01,142;00:46:02,776;We're at war.

719;00:46:02,810;00:46:05,911;are in danger.
720;00:46:08,915;00:46:12,418;I heard a disgusting lie
720;00:46:08,915;00:46:12,418;about Uncle Jaime.
721;00:46:12,452;00:46:14,086;And you.

722;00:46:15,255;00:46:16,756;will say anything
723;00:46:16,790;00:46:18,791;to weaken your claim
723;00:46:16,790;00:46:18,791;to the throne.
724;00:46:18,826;00:46:20,961;It's not a claim.
724;00:46:18,826;00:46:20,961;The throne is mine.
725;00:46:22,263;00:46:24,365;Of course it is.
726;00:46:26,335;00:46:28,236;No one believes
726;00:46:26,335;00:46:28,236;this foul gossip.

731;00:46:40,749;00:46:43,151;I'm asking if he fucked

732;00:46:43,186;00:46:44,720;when he grew tired

733;00:46:44,754;00:46:46,555;does he have running--
