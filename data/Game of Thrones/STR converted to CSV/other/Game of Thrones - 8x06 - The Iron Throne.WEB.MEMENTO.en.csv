2;00:00:07,188;00:00:08,480;if they know the war is lost.
3;00:00:08,689;00:00:09,897;Give them that chance.

5;00:00:12,355;00:00:14,021;they will ring the bells
5;00:00:12,355;00:00:14,021;and raise the gates.

7;00:04:49,522;00:04:51,063;I'll find you later.
8;00:04:53,772;00:04:54,814;It's not safe.
9;00:04:58,271;00:04:59,980;Let me send some men with you.
10;00:05:03,980;00:05:05,313;I'm going alone.
11;00:05:51,188;00:05:53,230;In the name of the one true queen,
12;00:05:53,313;00:05:54,605;Daenerys Targaryen,
13;00:05:55,730;00:05:57,397;I sentence you to die.
14;00:05:58,397;00:05:59,730;Grey Worm!
15;00:06:06,772;00:06:08,480;It's over.
16;00:06:08,563;00:06:09,939;These men are prisoners.
17;00:06:10,021;00:06:12,647;It is not over until the queen's
17;00:06:10,021;00:06:12,647;enemies are defeated.
18;00:06:12,730;00:06:14,897;How much more defeated
18;00:06:12,730;00:06:14,897;do you want them to be?
19;00:06:14,980;00:06:17,063;They're on their knees.
19;00:06:14,980;00:06:17,063;They are breathing.
20;00:06:18,230;00:06:20,188;Look around you, friend. We won.
21;00:06:20,271;00:06:22,605;I obey my queen's commands, not yours.
22;00:06:22,689;00:06:24,980;And what are the queen's commands?
23;00:06:26,271;00:06:29,438;Kill all who follow
23;00:06:26,271;00:06:29,438;Cersei Lannister.
24;00:06:30,355;00:06:31,730;These are free men.
25;00:06:32,689;00:06:34,772;They chose to fight for her.
26;00:06:37,438;00:06:39,939;Easy, men. Easy! Easy.
27;00:06:49,897;00:06:50,855;Jon.
28;00:06:53,563;00:06:55,772;We should speak with the queen.
29;00:12:09,730;00:12:11,271;Hyah!
30;00:15:26,939;00:15:28,021;Torgo Nudho.
31;00:18:09,939;00:18:11,772;You freed your brother.
32;00:18:13,188;00:18:14,939;You committed treason.
33;00:18:16,438;00:18:18,772;I freed my brother.
34;00:18:21,522;00:18:24,021;And you slaughtered a city.
35;00:20:18,063;00:20:20,063;What are you doing here?
36;00:20:22,772;00:20:25,647;Hey, what happened?
37;00:20:25,730;00:20:27,480;I came to kill Cersei.
38;00:20:28,897;00:20:30,605;Your queen got there first.
39;00:20:35,105;00:20:37,146;She's everyone's queen now.
40;00:20:37,230;00:20:39,772;Try telling Sansa.
41;00:20:46,605;00:20:48,271;Wait for me outside the city gates.
42;00:20:48,355;00:20:50,105;I'll come find you.
42;00:20:48,355;00:20:50,105;Jon.
43;00:20:52,271;00:20:53,647;She knows who you are.
44;00:20:54,939;00:20:56,271;Who you really are.
45;00:20:56,355;00:20:58,772;You'll always be a threat to her.
46;00:21:01,313;00:21:03,855;And I know a killer when I see one.
47;00:21:36,271;00:21:38,021;Did you bring any wine?
48;00:21:39,271;00:21:40,313;No.
49;00:21:41,939;00:21:43,438;Ah...
50;00:21:43,522;00:21:44,480;Well...
51;00:21:46,438;00:21:48,647;thank you for coming to see me.
52;00:21:49,939;00:21:52,980;Our queen doesn't keep prisoners
52;00:21:49,939;00:21:52,980;for long.
53;00:21:54,480;00:21:57,563;I suppose there's
53;00:21:54,480;00:21:57,563;a crude kind of justice.
54;00:21:59,355;00:22:03,230;I betrayed my closest friend
54;00:21:59,355;00:22:03,230;and watched him burn.
55;00:22:03,313;00:22:06,438;Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes:
56;00:22:06,522;00:22:09,021;See, I told you.
57;00:22:13,689;00:22:15,647;It just occurred to me.
58;00:22:15,730;00:22:17,355;I'm talking to the only man alive
59;00:22:17,438;00:22:19,397;who knows where I'm going.
60;00:22:20,897;00:22:23,188;So is there life after death?
61;00:22:26,522;00:22:28,021;Not that I've seen.
62;00:22:29,271;00:22:31,563;I should be thankful.
63;00:22:31,647;00:22:34,522;Oblivion is the best I could hope for.
64;00:22:35,855;00:22:37,939;I strangled my lover.
65;00:22:38,021;00:22:40,271;I shot my own father with a crossbow.
66;00:22:40,355;00:22:41,480;I betrayed my queen.
67;00:22:41,563;00:22:43,063;You didn't.
67;00:22:41,563;00:22:43,063;I did.
68;00:22:44,897;00:22:45,939;And I'd do it again,
69;00:22:46,021;00:22:48,230;now that I've seen what I've seen.
70;00:22:49,563;00:22:51,563;I chose my fate.
71;00:22:51,647;00:22:54,438;The people of King's Landing did not.
72;00:22:56,730;00:22:58,939;I can't justify what happened.
73;00:23:00,647;00:23:01,730;I won't try.
74;00:23:05,021;00:23:07,814;But the war is over now.
74;00:23:05,021;00:23:07,814;Is it?
75;00:23:10,146;00:23:13,105;When you heard her
75;00:23:10,146;00:23:13,105;talking to her soldiers,
76;00:23:13,188;00:23:16,313;did she sound like someone
76;00:23:13,188;00:23:16,313;who's done fighting?
77;00:23:24,605;00:23:27,438;She liberated the people
77;00:23:24,605;00:23:27,438;of Slaver's Bay.
78;00:23:27,522;00:23:30,647;She liberated the people
78;00:23:27,522;00:23:30,647;of King's Landing.
79;00:23:30,730;00:23:32,522;And she'll go on liberating
80;00:23:32,605;00:23:35,689;until the people of the world
80;00:23:32,605;00:23:35,689;are free...
81;00:23:35,772;00:23:37,105;and she rules them all.
82;00:23:37,188;00:23:40,522;And you've been by her side,
82;00:23:37,188;00:23:40,522;counseling her.
83;00:23:40,605;00:23:41,980;Until today.
84;00:23:43,522;00:23:44,772;Until today.
85;00:23:48,438;00:23:50,355;Varys was right.
86;00:23:50,438;00:23:52,313;I was wrong.
87;00:23:52,397;00:23:55,230;It was vanity
87;00:23:52,397;00:23:55,230;to think I could guide her.
88;00:23:55,313;00:23:57,563;Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
89;00:23:57,647;00:24:00,230;You think our house words
89;00:23:57,647;00:24:00,230;are stamped on our bodies
90;00:24:00,313;00:24:02,397;when we're born and that's who we are?
91;00:24:02,480;00:24:04,814;Then I'd be fire and blood too.
92;00:24:06,397;00:24:07,522;She's not her father,
93;00:24:07,605;00:24:09,146;no more than you're Tywin Lannister.
94;00:24:09,230;00:24:14,563;My father was an evil man.
94;00:24:09,230;00:24:14,563;My sister was an evil woman.
95;00:24:14,647;00:24:15,939;Pile up all the bodies
96;00:24:16,021;00:24:18,021;of all the people they ever killed,
97;00:24:18,105;00:24:19,563;there still won't be half as many
98;00:24:19,647;00:24:22,397;as our beautiful queen
98;00:24:19,647;00:24:22,397;slaughtered in a single day.
99;00:24:22,480;00:24:23,730;Cersei left her no choice.
100;00:24:23,814;00:24:25,188;The moment the gates fell,
101;00:24:25,271;00:24:26,313;the battle was over.
102;00:24:26,397;00:24:28,397;She saw her friend beheaded.
103;00:24:28,480;00:24:30,313;She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
104;00:24:30,397;00:24:32,230;And she burned down a city for it.
105;00:24:32,313;00:24:34,814;Ah, it's easy to judge
105;00:24:32,313;00:24:34,814;when you're standing
106;00:24:34,897;00:24:36,063;far from the battlefield.
107;00:24:36,146;00:24:37,814;Would you have done it?
108;00:24:39,397;00:24:40,647;What?
109;00:24:42,146;00:24:44,814;You've been up there,
109;00:24:42,146;00:24:44,814;on a dragon's back.
110;00:24:44,897;00:24:46,188;You've had that power.
111;00:24:46,271;00:24:48,105;Would you have burned the city down?
112;00:24:52,021;00:24:54,105;I don't know.
113;00:24:54,188;00:24:55,605;Yes, you do.
114;00:24:57,647;00:25:00,689;You won't say because
114;00:24:57,647;00:25:00,689;you don't want to betray her...
115;00:25:02,563;00:25:03,897;but you know.
116;00:25:12,230;00:25:14,438;What's it matter what I'd do?
117;00:25:14,522;00:25:17,689;It matters more than anything.
118;00:25:21,980;00:25:24,730;When she murdered
118;00:25:21,980;00:25:24,730;the slavers of Astapor,
119;00:25:26,063;00:25:28,313;I'm sure no one
119;00:25:26,063;00:25:28,313;but the slavers complained.
120;00:25:28,397;00:25:30,271;After all, they were evil men.
121;00:25:31,980;00:25:35,814;When she crucified hundreds
121;00:25:31,980;00:25:35,814;of Meereenese nobles,
122;00:25:35,897;00:25:36,855;who could argue?
123;00:25:36,939;00:25:38,438;They were evil men.
124;00:25:39,689;00:25:43,271;The Dothraki khals she burned alive?
125;00:25:43,355;00:25:45,939;They would have done worse to her.
126;00:25:47,397;00:25:51,605;Everywhere she goes, evil men die
127;00:25:51,689;00:25:53,814;and we cheer her for it.
128;00:25:55,188;00:25:56,522;And she grows more powerful
129;00:25:56,605;00:26:00,146;and more sure
129;00:25:56,605;00:26:00,146;that she is good and right.
130;00:26:05,563;00:26:06,855;She believes her destiny
131;00:26:06,939;00:26:10,230;is to build a better world
131;00:26:06,939;00:26:10,230;for everyone.
132;00:26:10,313;00:26:11,772;If you believed that...
133;00:26:13,397;00:26:14,605;if you truly believed it,
134;00:26:14,689;00:26:15,855;wouldn't you kill
135;00:26:15,939;00:26:18,689;whoever stood between you and paradise?
136;00:26:50,146;00:26:52,313;I know you love her.
137;00:26:57,563;00:26:59,480;I love her too.
138;00:27:03,146;00:27:06,814;Not as successfully as you.
139;00:27:09,480;00:27:13,980;But I believed in her
139;00:27:09,480;00:27:13,980;with all my heart.
140;00:27:21,730;00:27:25,146;Love is more powerful than reason.
141;00:27:27,814;00:27:29,897;We all know that.
142;00:27:29,980;00:27:31,689;Look at my brother.
143;00:27:36,772;00:27:39,063;Love is the death of duty.
144;00:27:44,772;00:27:46,855;You just came up with that?
145;00:27:52,271;00:27:55,689;Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.
146;00:28:00,772;00:28:05,271;Sometimes duty is the death of love.
147;00:28:10,689;00:28:14,814;You are the shield
147;00:28:10,689;00:28:14,814;that guards the realms of men.
148;00:28:14,897;00:28:17,313;And you've always tried
148;00:28:14,897;00:28:17,313;to do the right thing.
149;00:28:17,397;00:28:19,063;No matter the cost,
150;00:28:20,063;00:28:22,397;you've tried to protect people.
151;00:28:24,563;00:28:27,730;Who is the greatest threat
151;00:28:24,563;00:28:27,730;to the people now?
152;00:28:35,271;00:28:37,897;It's a terrible thing I'm asking.
153;00:28:39,271;00:28:41,313;It's also the right thing.
154;00:28:43,605;00:28:47,063;Do you think I'm the last man
154;00:28:43,605;00:28:47,063;she'll execute?
155;00:28:49,063;00:28:50,313;Who is more dangerous
156;00:28:50,397;00:28:53,772;than the rightful heir
156;00:28:50,397;00:28:53,772;to the Iron Throne?
157;00:29:06,772;00:29:09,605;That's her decision.
157;00:29:06,772;00:29:09,605;She is the queen.
158;00:29:18,355;00:29:20,313;I'm sorry it came to this.
159;00:29:32,188;00:29:33,980;And your sisters?
160;00:29:35,980;00:29:38,855;Do you see them bending the knee?
161;00:29:42,480;00:29:44,230;My sisters will be loyal to the throne.
162;00:29:44,313;00:29:48,063;Why do you think Sansa
162;00:29:44,313;00:29:48,063;told me the truth about you?
163;00:29:48,146;00:29:50,230;Because she doesn't want Dany
163;00:29:48,146;00:29:50,230;to be queen.
164;00:29:50,313;00:29:53,230;She doesn't get to choose.
164;00:29:50,313;00:29:53,230;No.
165;00:29:53,313;00:29:54,647;But you do.
166;00:29:56,271;00:29:58,146;And you have to choose now.
167;00:33:58,438;00:34:00,980;When I was a girl,
167;00:33:58,438;00:34:00,980;my brother told me it was made
168;00:34:01,063;00:34:04,563;with 1000 swords
168;00:34:01,063;00:34:04,563;from Aegon's fallen enemies.
169;00:34:07,438;00:34:09,271;What do 1000 swords look like
170;00:34:09,355;00:34:12,105;in the mind of a little girl
170;00:34:09,355;00:34:12,105;who can't count to 20?
171;00:34:13,522;00:34:17,355;I imagined a mountain of swords
171;00:34:13,522;00:34:17,355;too high to climb.
172;00:34:17,438;00:34:18,855;So many fallen enemies,
173;00:34:18,939;00:34:21,146;you could only see
173;00:34:18,939;00:34:21,146;the soles of Aegon's feet.
174;00:34:21,230;00:34:22,397;I saw them executing
175;00:34:22,480;00:34:24,397;Lannister prisoners in the street.
176;00:34:25,689;00:34:28,021;They said they were acting
176;00:34:25,689;00:34:28,021;on your orders.
177;00:34:28,105;00:34:31,313;It was necessary.
177;00:34:28,105;00:34:31,313;Necessary?
178;00:34:31,397;00:34:33,188;Have you been down there?
179;00:34:33,271;00:34:34,522;Have you seen?
180;00:34:34,605;00:34:37,355;Children, little children, burned!
181;00:34:40,146;00:34:42,772;I tried to make peace with Cersei.
182;00:34:44,105;00:34:47,647;She used their innocence
182;00:34:44,105;00:34:47,647;as a weapon against me.
183;00:34:47,730;00:34:49,522;She thought it would cripple me.
184;00:34:49,605;00:34:51,271;And Tyrion?
185;00:34:54,605;00:34:58,230;He conspired behind my back
185;00:34:54,605;00:34:58,230;with my enemies.
186;00:34:58,313;00:35:01,146;How have you treated people
186;00:34:58,313;00:35:01,146;who've done the same to you,
187;00:35:01,230;00:35:03,772;even when it broke your heart?
188;00:35:06,271;00:35:07,814;Forgive him.
189;00:35:10,146;00:35:11,855;I can't.
189;00:35:10,146;00:35:11,855;You can.
190;00:35:13,480;00:35:14,772;You can forgive all of them,
191;00:35:14,855;00:35:17,563;make them see they made a mistake.
192;00:35:17,647;00:35:19,480;Make them understand.
193;00:35:24,146;00:35:26,146;Please, Dany.
194;00:35:29,355;00:35:31,980;We can't hide behind small mercies.
195;00:35:33,313;00:35:35,355;The world we need
196;00:35:35,438;00:35:38,188;won't be built by men
196;00:35:35,438;00:35:38,188;loyal to the world we have.
197;00:35:38,271;00:35:42,271;The world we need is a world
197;00:35:38,271;00:35:42,271;of mercy. It has to be.
198;00:35:42,355;00:35:43,897;And it will be.
199;00:35:46,730;00:35:51,689;It's not easy to see something
199;00:35:46,730;00:35:51,689;that's never been before.
200;00:35:54,230;00:35:56,021;A good world.
201;00:35:57,021;00:35:58,689;How do you know?
202;00:36:00,563;00:36:02,772;How do you know it'll be good?
203;00:36:02,855;00:36:04,605;Because I know what is good.
204;00:36:05,980;00:36:07,188;And so do you.
205;00:36:07,271;00:36:09,605;I don't.
205;00:36:07,271;00:36:09,605;You do.
206;00:36:09,689;00:36:12,355;You do. You've always known.
207;00:36:15,188;00:36:17,021;What about everyone else?
208;00:36:18,855;00:36:22,188;All the other people
208;00:36:18,855;00:36:22,188;who think they know what's good.
209;00:36:24,355;00:36:26,522;They don't get to choose.
210;00:36:32,313;00:36:33,480;Be with me.
211;00:36:35,063;00:36:37,188;Build the new world with me.
212;00:36:37,271;00:36:39,647;This is our reason.
213;00:36:39,730;00:36:41,230;It has been from the beginning,
214;00:36:41,313;00:36:44,480;since you were a little boy
214;00:36:41,313;00:36:44,480;with a bastard's name
215;00:36:44,563;00:36:48,063;and I was a little girl
215;00:36:44,563;00:36:48,063;who couldn't count to 20.
216;00:36:48,897;00:36:50,730;We do it together.
217;00:36:52,855;00:36:55,980;We break the wheel together.
218;00:36:58,897;00:37:00,563;You are my queen.
219;00:37:01,939;00:37:04,814;Now, and always.
220;00:44:27,063;00:44:28,522;Where's Jon?
221;00:44:28,605;00:44:31,689;He is our prisoner.
221;00:44:28,605;00:44:31,689;So is Lord Tyrion.
222;00:44:31,772;00:44:34,021;They were both to be brought
222;00:44:31,772;00:44:34,021;to this gathering.
223;00:44:34,105;00:44:36,814;We will decide what we do
223;00:44:34,105;00:44:36,814;with our prisoners.
224;00:44:36,897;00:44:38,271;This is our city now.
225;00:44:38,355;00:44:40,772;If you look outside the walls
225;00:44:38,355;00:44:40,772;of your city,
226;00:44:40,855;00:44:42,438;you'll find thousands of Northmen
227;00:44:42,522;00:44:45,146;who will explain to you
227;00:44:42,522;00:44:45,146;why harming Jon Snow
228;00:44:45,230;00:44:46,897;is not in your interest.
229;00:44:46,980;00:44:48,939;And you will find
229;00:44:46,980;00:44:48,939;thousands of Unsullied
230;00:44:49,021;00:44:50,188;who believe that it is.
231;00:44:50,271;00:44:52,980;Some of you may be quick to forgive.
232;00:44:53,063;00:44:55,146;The Ironborn are not.
233;00:44:55,230;00:44:57,146;I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.
234;00:44:57,230;00:44:58,980;You swore to follow a tyrant.
235;00:44:59,063;00:45:00,855;She freed us from a tyrant.
236;00:45:00,939;00:45:02,397;Cersei is gone because of her,
237;00:45:02,480;00:45:04,814;and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart.
238;00:45:04,897;00:45:07,146;Let the Unsullied give him
238;00:45:04,897;00:45:07,146;what he deserves.
239;00:45:07,230;00:45:09,188;Say another word
239;00:45:07,230;00:45:09,188;about killing my brother
240;00:45:09,271;00:45:10,563;and I'll cut your throat.
241;00:45:10,647;00:45:12,063;Friends, please.
242;00:45:14,063;00:45:17,271;We've been cutting each other's
242;00:45:14,063;00:45:17,271;throats long enough.
243;00:45:17,355;00:45:20,146;Torgo Nudho.
243;00:45:17,355;00:45:20,146;Am I saying that properly?
244;00:45:23,689;00:45:25,313;If it weren't for you and your men,
245;00:45:25,397;00:45:27,814;we would've lost the war with the dead.
246;00:45:27,897;00:45:30,480;This country owes you
246;00:45:27,897;00:45:30,480;a debt it can never repay,
247;00:45:30,563;00:45:32,188;but let us try.
248;00:45:32,271;00:45:34,313;There is land in the Reach.
249;00:45:34,397;00:45:35,647;Good land.
250;00:45:35,730;00:45:38,271;The people that used to live
250;00:45:35,730;00:45:38,271;there are gone.
251;00:45:38,355;00:45:40,355;Make it your own.
251;00:45:38,355;00:45:40,355;Start your own house
252;00:45:40,438;00:45:42,897;with the Unsullied as your bannermen.
253;00:45:42,980;00:45:44,855;We've had enough war.
254;00:45:44,939;00:45:47,188;Thousands of you, thousands of them.
255;00:45:47,271;00:45:49,188;You know how it ends.
256;00:45:49,271;00:45:50,980;We need to find a better way.
257;00:45:51,063;00:45:53,522;We do not need payment.
258;00:45:53,605;00:45:55,105;We need justice.
259;00:45:56,313;00:45:58,105;Jon Snow cannot go free.
260;00:46:01,355;00:46:03,021;It's not for you to decide.
261;00:46:03,105;00:46:04,605;You are not here to speak!
262;00:46:05,855;00:46:08,188;Everyone has heard enough words
262;00:46:05,855;00:46:08,188;from you.
263;00:46:10,271;00:46:12,105;You're right.
264;00:46:12,188;00:46:14,814;And no one's any better for it.
265;00:46:16,146;00:46:18,313;But it's not for you to decide.
266;00:46:19,980;00:46:22,230;Jon committed his crime here.
267;00:46:22,313;00:46:25,814;His fate is for our king to decide.
268;00:46:25,897;00:46:27,188;Or our queen.
269;00:46:27,271;00:46:29,480;We don't have a king or queen.
270;00:46:30,814;00:46:33,814;You're the most powerful people
270;00:46:30,814;00:46:33,814;in Westeros.
271;00:46:36,188;00:46:37,814;Choose one.
272;00:46:47,438;00:46:48,980;Make your choice, then.
273;00:47:11,689;00:47:13,271;My lords and ladies...
274;00:47:16,689;00:47:21,271;I suppose this is the most
274;00:47:16,689;00:47:21,271;important moment of our lives.
275;00:47:21,355;00:47:23,605;What we decide today will reverberate
276;00:47:23,689;00:47:25,397;through the annals of history.
277;00:47:25,480;00:47:27,438;I stand before you
278;00:47:27,522;00:47:30,522;as one of the senior lords
278;00:47:27,522;00:47:30,522;in the country.
279;00:47:31,397;00:47:33,188;A veteran of two wars.
280;00:47:34,355;00:47:35,897;And I like to think my experience
281;00:47:35,980;00:47:39,814;has led to some small skill
281;00:47:35,980;00:47:39,814;in statecraft
282;00:47:39,897;00:47:41,313;and underst--
282;00:47:39,897;00:47:41,313;Uncle?
283;00:47:44,230;00:47:45,230;Please sit.
284;00:48:17,188;00:48:19,605;Well, we have to choose someone.
285;00:48:19,689;00:48:20,939;Um, ahem...
286;00:48:21,021;00:48:22,814;Why just us?
287;00:48:26,939;00:48:28,105;Um--
288;00:48:29,855;00:48:32,188;We represent all the great houses,
289;00:48:32,271;00:48:33,563;but whomever we choose,
290;00:48:33,647;00:48:36,939;they won't just rule over
290;00:48:33,647;00:48:36,939;lords and ladies.
291;00:48:37,021;00:48:40,355;Maybe the decision about
291;00:48:37,021;00:48:40,355;what's best for everyone
292;00:48:40,438;00:48:41,605;should be left to...
293;00:48:42,772;00:48:45,480;well, everyone.
294;00:48:58,980;00:49:01,897;Maybe we should give the dogs
294;00:48:58,980;00:49:01,897;a vote as well.
295;00:49:01,980;00:49:03,480;I'll ask my horse.
296;00:49:12,647;00:49:15,230;I suppose you want the crown.
297;00:49:15,313;00:49:16,730;Me?
298;00:49:17,313;00:49:18,814;The Imp?
299;00:49:20,438;00:49:22,814;Half the people hate me
299;00:49:20,438;00:49:22,814;for serving Daenerys,
300;00:49:22,897;00:49:25,021;the other half hate me
300;00:49:22,897;00:49:25,021;for betraying her.
301;00:49:26,980;00:49:30,480;Can't think of a worse choice.
301;00:49:26,980;00:49:30,480;Who, then?
302;00:49:36,980;00:49:41,188;I've had nothing to do but think
302;00:49:36,980;00:49:41,188;these past few weeks.
303;00:49:42,897;00:49:45,271;About our bloody history.
304;00:49:46,689;00:49:48,897;About the mistakes we've made.
305;00:49:59,855;00:50:02,188;What unites people?
306;00:50:04,563;00:50:06,021;Armies?
307;00:50:07,563;00:50:08,939;Gold?
308;00:50:11,230;00:50:13,021;Flags?
309;00:50:19,730;00:50:21,355;Stories.
310;00:50:23,230;00:50:25,438;There's nothing in the world
310;00:50:23,230;00:50:25,438;more powerful
311;00:50:25,522;00:50:26,730;than a good story.
312;00:50:29,063;00:50:30,730;Nothing can stop it.
313;00:50:32,063;00:50:33,939;No enemy can defeat it.
314;00:50:35,689;00:50:37,313;And who has a better story...
315;00:50:38,605;00:50:40,271;than Bran the Broken?
316;00:50:44,146;00:50:47,397;The boy who fell
316;00:50:44,146;00:50:47,397;from a high tower and lived.
317;00:50:48,897;00:50:52,980;He knew he'd never walk again,
317;00:50:48,897;00:50:52,980;so he learned to fly.
318;00:50:54,146;00:50:56,563;He crossed beyond the Wall,
319;00:50:56,647;00:50:58,146;a crippled boy,
320;00:50:58,230;00:51:00,939;and became the Three-Eyed Raven.
321;00:51:03,313;00:51:05,313;He is our memory,
322;00:51:05,397;00:51:08,063;the keeper of all our stories.
323;00:51:08,146;00:51:12,605;The wars, weddings, births,
323;00:51:08,146;00:51:12,605;massacres, famines.
324;00:51:12,689;00:51:14,605;Our triumphs,
325;00:51:14,689;00:51:17,230;mm, our defeats,
326;00:51:17,313;00:51:18,438;our past.
327;00:51:20,313;00:51:23,105;Who better to lead us into the future?
328;00:51:26,105;00:51:29,897;Bran has no interest in ruling
328;00:51:26,105;00:51:29,897;and he can't father children.
329;00:51:29,980;00:51:31,188;Good.
330;00:51:31,271;00:51:33,772;Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid,
331;00:51:33,855;00:51:35,271;as you well know.
332;00:51:36,313;00:51:38,271;His will never torment us.
333;00:51:42,355;00:51:45,647;That is the wheel
333;00:51:42,355;00:51:45,647;our queen wanted to break.
334;00:51:52,814;00:51:55,897;From now on, rulers will not be born.
335;00:51:55,980;00:51:58,814;They will be chosen on this spot
336;00:51:58,897;00:52:01,897;by the lords and ladies of Westeros...
337;00:52:01,980;00:52:04,146;to serve the realm.
338;00:52:12,188;00:52:14,188;I know you don't want it.
339;00:52:15,397;00:52:18,980;I know you don't care about power.
340;00:52:21,063;00:52:25,021;But I ask you now, if we choose you...
341;00:52:26,605;00:52:28,063;will you wear the crown?
342;00:52:29,730;00:52:32,814;Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms
342;00:52:29,730;00:52:32,814;to the best of your abilities
343;00:52:32,897;00:52:35,689;from this day until your last day?
344;00:52:41,355;00:52:44,271;Why do you think I came all this way?
345;00:52:50,855;00:52:53,021;To Brandon of House Stark...
346;00:52:54,480;00:52:55,689;I say aye.
347;00:53:07,313;00:53:08,355;Aye.
348;00:53:15,063;00:53:16,063;Aye.
349;00:53:17,355;00:53:18,313;Aye.
350;00:53:21,397;00:53:22,480;Aye.
351;00:53:25,355;00:53:26,313;Aye.
352;00:53:30,939;00:53:32,647;Aye.
353;00:53:32,730;00:53:34,313;Aye.
354;00:53:34,397;00:53:35,647;Aye.
355;00:53:35,730;00:53:37,772;Aye.
355;00:53:35,730;00:53:37,772;Aye.
356;00:53:37,855;00:53:38,814;Aye.
357;00:53:40,730;00:53:43,397;I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.
358;00:53:45,522;00:53:46,480;Aye.
359;00:53:57,647;00:53:59,939;I love you, little brother.
359;00:53:57,647;00:53:59,939;I always will.
360;00:54:00,021;00:54:01,772;You'll be a good king.
361;00:54:03,021;00:54:05,313;But tens of thousands of Northmen
362;00:54:05,397;00:54:08,188;fell in the Great War
362;00:54:05,397;00:54:08,188;defending all of Westeros.
363;00:54:08,271;00:54:10,271;And those who survived
363;00:54:08,271;00:54:10,271;have seen too much
364;00:54:10,355;00:54:13,271;and fought too hard
364;00:54:10,355;00:54:13,271;ever to kneel again.
365;00:54:15,980;00:54:19,480;The North will remain
365;00:54:15,980;00:54:19,480;an independent kingdom,
366;00:54:19,563;00:54:21,605;as it was for thousands of years.
367;00:54:46,730;00:54:49,563;All hail Bran the Broken,
368;00:54:49,647;00:54:50,772;First of His Name,
369;00:54:50,855;00:54:54,063;King of the Andals and the First Men,
370;00:54:54,146;00:54:58,855;Lord of the Six Kingdoms
370;00:54:54,146;00:54:58,855;and Protector of the Realm.
371;00:55:01,647;00:55:04,647;All hail Bran the Broken!
372;00:55:16,480;00:55:18,271;Lord Tyrion...
373;00:55:19,689;00:55:21,480;you will be my Hand.
374;00:55:21,563;00:55:23,271;N--
375;00:55:23,355;00:55:26,605;No, Your Grace, I don't want it.
376;00:55:26,689;00:55:28,772;And I don't want to be king.
377;00:55:30,855;00:55:33,146;I don't deserve it.
378;00:55:33,230;00:55:36,105;I thought I was wise, but I wasn't.
379;00:55:36,188;00:55:40,271;I thought I knew what was right,
379;00:55:36,188;00:55:40,271;but I didn't.
380;00:55:42,605;00:55:44,105;Choose Ser Davos.
381;00:55:44,188;00:55:45,563;Choose anyone else.
382;00:55:45,647;00:55:47,939;I choose you.
382;00:55:45,647;00:55:47,939;You cannot.
383;00:55:48,021;00:55:49,772;Yes, I can.
384;00:55:49,855;00:55:52,271;I'm king.
384;00:55:49,855;00:55:52,271;This man is a criminal.
385;00:55:52,355;00:55:55,647;He deserves justice.
385;00:55:52,355;00:55:55,647;He just got it.
386;00:55:55,730;00:55:58,188;He's made many terrible mistakes.
387;00:55:58,271;00:56:01,730;He's going to spend the rest
387;00:55:58,271;00:56:01,730;of his life fixing them.
388;00:56:06,480;00:56:08,146;It is not enough.
389;00:56:16,188;00:56:18,980;Giving you to the
389;00:56:16,188;00:56:18,980;Unsullied would start a war.
390;00:56:20,397;00:56:22,563;Letting you walk free
390;00:56:20,397;00:56:22,563;would start a war.
391;00:56:23,730;00:56:25,146;So our new king has chosen
392;00:56:25,230;00:56:26,980;to send you to the Night's Watch.
393;00:56:29,063;00:56:30,647;There's still a Night's Watch?
394;00:56:32,897;00:56:34,480;The world will always need a home
395;00:56:34,563;00:56:35,980;for bastards and broken men.
396;00:56:41,063;00:56:43,188;You shall take no wife,
397;00:56:43,271;00:56:45,355;hold no lands,
398;00:56:45,438;00:56:46,980;father no children.
399;00:56:50,105;00:56:52,939;The Unsullied wanted your head
399;00:56:50,105;00:56:52,939;of course,
400;00:56:53,021;00:56:56,355;but Grey Worm has accepted
400;00:56:53,021;00:56:56,355;the justice of a life sentence.
401;00:56:58,021;00:57:01,188;Sansa and Arya wanted you freed,
402;00:57:01,271;00:57:05,271;but they understand our new king
402;00:57:01,271;00:57:05,271;needs to make peace.
403;00:57:05,355;00:57:06,814;No one is very happy.
404;00:57:07,980;00:57:09,855;Which means it's a good compromise,
405;00:57:09,939;00:57:10,855;I suppose.
406;00:57:12,814;00:57:14,522;Was it right?
407;00:57:17,605;00:57:19,105;What I did?
408;00:57:21,980;00:57:23,730;What we did.
409;00:57:27,397;00:57:29,355;It doesn't feel right.
410;00:57:35,980;00:57:38,480;Ask me again in 10 years.
411;00:58:00,980;00:58:04,438;I don't expect
411;00:58:00,980;00:58:04,438;we'll ever see each other again.
412;00:58:08,438;00:58:09,855;I wouldn't be so sure.
413;00:58:11,105;00:58:12,605;A few years as Hand of the King
414;00:58:12,689;00:58:15,689;would make anyone want to
414;00:58:12,689;00:58:15,689;piss off the edge of the world.
415;01:00:34,480;01:00:37,146;I wish there had been another way.
416;01:00:38,647;01:00:40,146;Can you forgive me?
417;01:00:52,397;01:00:54,897;The North is free, thanks to you.
418;01:00:56,939;01:00:59,063;But they lost their king.
419;01:01:00,355;01:01:03,188;Ned Stark's daughter
419;01:01:00,355;01:01:03,188;will speak for them.
420;01:01:05,271;01:01:07,689;She's the best they could ask for.
421;01:01:27,647;01:01:30,689;You can come see me, you know,
421;01:01:27,647;01:01:30,689;at Castle Black.
422;01:01:31,897;01:01:33,480;I can't.
423;01:01:33,563;01:01:37,146;You think anyone will dare
423;01:01:33,563;01:01:37,146;tell you women aren't allowed?
424;01:01:42,855;01:01:44,313;I'm not going back north.
425;01:01:46,355;01:01:47,814;Where are you going?
426;01:01:49,897;01:01:52,063;What's west of Westeros?
427;01:01:54,522;01:01:56,021;I don't know.
428;01:01:56,105;01:01:57,397;No one knows.
429;01:01:58,605;01:02:00,814;It's where all the maps stop.
430;01:02:02,897;01:02:04,605;That's where I'm going.
431;01:02:13,522;01:02:14,772;You have your Needle?
432;01:02:16,105;01:02:17,105;Right here.
433;01:02:39,188;01:02:40,855;Your Grace.
434;01:02:49,730;01:02:52,438;I'm sorry I wasn't there
434;01:02:49,730;01:02:52,438;when you needed me.
435;01:02:54,480;01:02:57,397;You were exactly where
435;01:02:54,480;01:02:57,397;you were supposed to be.
436;01:07:11,063;01:07:12,730;That's not-- Uh--
437;01:07:18,230;01:07:19,313;What's this?
438;01:07:19,397;01:07:21,980;A Song of Ice and Fire.
439;01:07:22,063;01:07:23,980;Archmaester Ebrose's history
439;01:07:22,063;01:07:23,980;of the wars
440;01:07:24,063;01:07:26,313;following the death of King Robert.
441;01:07:26,397;01:07:28,605;I helped him with the title.
442;01:07:31,355;01:07:34,021;I suppose I come in
442;01:07:31,355;01:07:34,021;for some heavy criticism.
443;01:07:34,105;01:07:36,480;Oh, I wouldn't say that.
444;01:07:36,563;01:07:39,271;Oh, he's kind to me.
444;01:07:36,563;01:07:39,271;Never would've guessed.
445;01:07:43,522;01:07:44,980;He's not kind?
446;01:07:45,980;01:07:47,438;He...
446;01:07:45,980;01:07:47,438;He what?
447;01:07:48,563;01:07:50,647;What does he say about me?
448;01:07:55,980;01:07:59,605;I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem.
449;01:08:21,188;01:08:22,355;Your Grace.
449;01:08:21,188;01:08:22,355;Your Grace.
450;01:08:22,438;01:08:23,647;Your Grace.

451;01:08:42,480;01:08:45,563;We appear to be missing
451;01:08:42,480;01:08:45,563;a Master of Whisperers.
452;01:08:45,647;01:08:47,230;And a Master of Laws.
453;01:08:47,313;01:08:49,647;And a Master of War.
453;01:08:47,313;01:08:49,647;Yes, Your Grace.
454;01:08:49,730;01:08:51,689;Suitable prospects
454;01:08:49,730;01:08:51,689;will be brought to you
455;01:08:51,772;01:08:53,689;for an audience in the coming weeks.
456;01:08:54,980;01:08:57,522;And Drogon? Any word?
457;01:08:57,605;01:08:59,563;He was last spotted flying east,
457;01:08:57,605;01:08:59,563;toward--
458;01:08:59,647;01:09:01,355;The farther away, the better.
459;01:09:03,105;01:09:04,355;Perhaps I can find him.
460;01:09:05,522;01:09:07,021;Do carry on with the rest.
461;01:09:08,188;01:09:10,063;As you wish, Your Grace.
462;01:09:12,230;01:09:13,730;Ser Podrick.
463;01:09:22,355;01:09:25,021;We serve at your pleasure,

465;01:09:28,772;01:09:30,855;Long may he reign.
465;01:09:28,772;01:09:30,855;Long may he reign.

468;01:09:35,855;01:09:37,021;That will improve.
469;01:09:38,188;01:09:39,522;I'm sure it will.

474;01:09:53,730;01:09:57,313;would you say the crown's debt
474;01:09:53,730;01:09:57,313;to you has been paid?
475;01:09:57,397;01:09:59,188;In full, my lord Hand.
476;01:09:59,271;01:10:00,313;Good.
477;01:10:00,397;01:10:02,647;Time to start incurring a new one.
478;01:10:02,730;01:10:04,105;We have hungry people to feed.
479;01:10:04,188;01:10:05,980;Can we expect some assistance
479;01:10:04,188;01:10:05,980;in this regard?
480;01:10:06,063;01:10:07,647;Indeed we can.
481;01:10:07,730;01:10:11,271;Lord Davos, we have an armada
481;01:10:07,730;01:10:11,271;to rebuild and ports to repair.
482;01:10:11,355;01:10:13,438;We have. These projects
482;01:10:11,355;01:10:13,438;will begin as soon as
483;01:10:13,522;01:10:16,814;the Master of Coin and Lord of
483;01:10:13,522;01:10:16,814;Lofty Titles provides funding.
484;01:10:16,897;01:10:20,146;The Master of Coin looks forward
484;01:10:16,897;01:10:20,146;to helping the Master of Ships,
485;01:10:20,230;01:10:22,939;but first he has to ensure
485;01:10:20,230;01:10:22,939;we're not wasting coin,
486;01:10:23,021;01:10:24,855;or soon there won't be no more coin.
487;01:10:24,939;01:10:26,105;Any more.
488;01:10:26,188;01:10:27,647;You Master of Grammar now too?
489;01:10:27,730;01:10:29,522;Grandmaester, ahem,
490;01:10:29,605;01:10:31,814;it is my theory,
490;01:10:29,605;01:10:31,814;based on my years of work
491;01:10:31,897;01:10:33,146;on the Casterly Rock sewers,
492;01:10:33,230;01:10:35,271;that clean water
492;01:10:33,230;01:10:35,271;leads to a healthier population.
493;01:10:35,355;01:10:38,105;The Archmaester has done
493;01:10:35,355;01:10:38,105;some research on this subject
494;01:10:38,188;01:10:39,230;and it turns out--
495;01:10:39,313;01:10:41,563;The strong live and the weak don't.
496;01:10:41,647;01:10:43,563;Find the best builders
496;01:10:41,647;01:10:43,563;and set them to the task.
497;01:10:43,647;01:10:47,146;Oh, speaking of builders,
497;01:10:43,647;01:10:47,146;all the best brothels burned down.
498;01:10:47,230;01:10:49,980;The Master of Coin is willing
498;01:10:47,230;01:10:49,980;to fund reconstruction.
499;01:10:50,063;01:10:53,021;Uh... the Archmaester
499;01:10:50,063;01:10:53,021;is less than enthusiastic
500;01:10:53,105;01:10:55,355;about the salutary effects of brothels.
501;01:10:55,438;01:10:57,897;Well, I imagine he
501;01:10:55,438;01:10:57,897;isn't using them properly.
502;01:10:57,980;01:11:00,146;I think we can all agree that ships
503;01:11:00,230;01:11:01,772;take precedence over brothels.
504;01:11:01,855;01:11:04,522;I think that's a
504;01:11:01,855;01:11:04,522;very presumptuous statement.
505;01:11:05,939;01:11:07,480;I once brought a jackass
506;01:11:07,563;01:11:09,814;and a honeycomb into a brothel.
507;01:15:29,313;01:15:31,146;The Queen in the North!
508;01:15:31,230;01:15:33,146;The Queen in the North!
509;01:15:33,230;01:15:34,939;The Queen in the North!
510;01:15:35,021;01:15:36,605;The Queen in the North!
511;01:15:36,689;01:15:38,105;The Queen in the North!
512;01:15:38,188;01:15:39,897;The Queen in the North!
