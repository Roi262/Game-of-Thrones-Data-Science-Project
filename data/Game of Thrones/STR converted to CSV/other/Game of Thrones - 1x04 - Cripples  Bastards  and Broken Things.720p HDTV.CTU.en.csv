2;00:00:01,716;00:00:02,700;For how long?
3;00:00:02,701;00:00:04,669;Until I command them
3;00:00:02,701;00:00:04,669;otherwise.
4;00:00:04,704;00:00:06,205;You're learning
4;00:00:04,704;00:00:06,205;to talk like a Queen.
5;00:00:06,239;00:00:08,942;Not a Queen.
5;00:00:06,239;00:00:08,942;A Khaleesi.
6;00:00:10,478;00:00:13,414;Lord Snow here
6;00:00:10,478;00:00:13,414;grew up in a castle
7;00:00:13,448;00:00:15,783;spitting down
7;00:00:13,448;00:00:15,783;on the likes of you.
8;00:00:15,817;00:00:17,818;Everybody knew
8;00:00:15,817;00:00:17,818;what this place was,
9;00:00:17,853;00:00:20,454;but no one told me--
9;00:00:17,853;00:00:20,454;no one but you.
10;00:00:20,489;00:00:22,489;The Khaleesi
10;00:00:20,489;00:00:22,489;have baby inside her.
11;00:00:22,524;00:00:24,859;It is true.
11;00:00:22,524;00:00:24,859;Her belly start to swell.
12;00:00:24,893;00:00:27,429;I need to ride to Qohor.
13;00:00:27,463;00:00:29,198;What did Aaerys Targaryen say
14;00:00:29,232;00:00:31,535;when you stabbed him
14;00:00:29,232;00:00:31,535;in the back?
15;00:00:31,569;00:00:34,005;He said the same thing
15;00:00:31,569;00:00:34,005;he'd been saying for hours--
16;00:00:34,039;00:00:35,540;burn them all.
17;00:00:35,574;00:00:37,942;My brother instructs us
17;00:00:35,574;00:00:37,942;to stage a tournament
18;00:00:37,976;00:00:40,978;in honor of Lord Stark's appointment
18;00:00:37,976;00:00:40,978;as Hand of the King.
19;00:00:41,012;00:00:43,549;This tournament is an extravagance
19;00:00:41,012;00:00:43,549;we cannot afford.
20;00:00:43,584;00:00:46,052;I'm leaving this morning.
20;00:00:43,584;00:00:46,052;My job is out there.
21;00:00:46,087;00:00:48,389;I won't let you down.
21;00:00:46,087;00:00:48,389;You're not going.
22;00:00:48,424;00:00:51,893;Here, a man gets what he earns
22;00:00:48,424;00:00:51,893;when he earns it.
23;00:00:51,928;00:00:55,731;I don't take orders
23;00:00:51,928;00:00:55,731;from savages or their sluts.
24;00:00:57,300;00:01:00,669;I don't want my brother harmed.
25;00:01:00,704;00:01:03,739;Mormont, kill these
25;00:01:00,704;00:01:03,739;Dothraki dogs!
26;00:01:05,208;00:01:08,210;We've come to a dangerous place.
26;00:01:05,208;00:01:08,210;We must protect ourselves.
27;00:01:09,713;00:01:10,746;Ah!
28;00:01:10,780;00:01:12,414;We allow the Northerners
28;00:01:10,780;00:01:12,414;too much power.
29;00:01:12,449;00:01:14,416;A good King knows
29;00:01:12,449;00:01:14,416;when to save his strength
30;00:01:14,450;00:01:16,518;and when to destroy
30;00:01:14,450;00:01:16,518;his enemies.
31;00:01:16,552;00:01:18,787;So you agree...
31;00:01:16,552;00:01:18,787;The Starks are enemies?
32;00:01:18,821;00:01:22,324;Everyone who isn't us
32;00:01:18,821;00:01:22,324;is an enemy.
33;00:01:22,358;00:01:25,262;Do you know whose dagger this is?
33;00:01:22,358;00:01:25,262;Littlefinger: I do.
34;00:01:25,296;00:01:27,631;Tyrion Lannister's...

48;00:04:51,227;00:04:53,328;Hodor.
49;00:04:59,169;00:05:02,972;I must say I received a slightly
49;00:04:59,169;00:05:02,972;warmer welcome on my last visit.

51;00:05:05,543;00:05:08,745;but not I, eh, boy?

53;00:05:10,749;00:05:12,717;I'm Lord of Winterfell
53;00:05:10,749;00:05:12,717;while my father is away.
54;00:05:12,751;00:05:16,254;Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.
55;00:05:18,324;00:05:20,192;So it's true.
56;00:05:22,061;00:05:24,295;Hello, Bran.
57;00:05:24,330;00:05:26,664;Do you remember anything
57;00:05:24,330;00:05:26,664;about what happened?
58;00:05:26,698;00:05:29,300;He has no memory
58;00:05:26,698;00:05:29,300;of that day.
59;00:05:29,334;00:05:31,768;Curious.
59;00:05:29,334;00:05:31,768;Why are you here
60;00:05:31,802;00:05:35,971;would your charming companion
60;00:05:31,802;00:05:35,971;be so kind as to kneel?
61;00:05:36,006;00:05:39,741;My neck is beginning to hurt.
61;00:05:36,006;00:05:39,741;Kneel, Hodor.
62;00:05:42,445;00:05:44,980;Do you like to ride, Bran?
62;00:05:42,445;00:05:44,980;Yes.
63;00:05:45,014;00:05:47,416;Well, I mean
63;00:05:45,014;00:05:47,416;I did like to.
64;00:05:47,451;00:05:49,686;The boy has lost the use of his legs.
64;00:05:47,451;00:05:49,686;What of it?
65;00:05:49,720;00:05:51,988;With the right horse and saddle,
65;00:05:49,720;00:05:51,988;even a cripple can ride.
66;00:05:52,023;00:05:55,059;I'm not a cripple.
66;00:05:52,023;00:05:55,059;Then I'm not a dwarf.
67;00:05:55,093;00:05:57,128;My father will
67;00:05:55,093;00:05:57,128;rejoice to hear it.
68;00:05:57,162;00:05:59,764;I have a gift
68;00:05:57,162;00:05:59,764;for you.
69;00:05:59,799;00:06:02,334;Give that to your saddler.
69;00:05:59,799;00:06:02,334;He'll provide the rest.
70;00:06:04,503;00:06:06,938;You must shape
70;00:06:04,503;00:06:06,938;the horse to the rider.
71;00:06:06,972;00:06:09,040;Start with a yearling
71;00:06:06,972;00:06:09,040;and teach it to respond
72;00:06:09,074;00:06:11,008;to the reins
72;00:06:09,074;00:06:11,008;and to the boy's voice.
73;00:06:12,277;00:06:13,944;Will I really be
73;00:06:12,277;00:06:13,944;able to ride?
74;00:06:13,979;00:06:15,546;You will.
75;00:06:15,580;00:06:17,914;On horseback you will be
75;00:06:15,580;00:06:17,914;as tall as any of them.
76;00:06:17,948;00:06:21,217;Is this some kind of trick?
76;00:06:17,948;00:06:21,217;Why do you want to help him?
77;00:06:21,251;00:06:22,952;I have a tender spot
77;00:06:21,251;00:06:22,952;in my heart
78;00:06:22,987;00:06:25,889;for cripples, bastards
78;00:06:22,987;00:06:25,889;and broken things.
79;00:06:27,125;00:06:29,026;You've done my brother
79;00:06:27,125;00:06:29,026;a kindness.
80;00:06:29,061;00:06:31,363;The hospitality
80;00:06:29,061;00:06:31,363;of Winterfell is yours.
81;00:06:31,397;00:06:34,232;Spare me your false courtesies,
81;00:06:31,397;00:06:34,232;Lord Stark.
82;00:06:34,266;00:06:36,468;There's a brothel
82;00:06:34,266;00:06:36,468;outside your walls.
83;00:06:36,502;00:06:39,404;There I'll find a bed and both
83;00:06:36,502;00:06:39,404;of us can sleep easier.
84;00:06:44,510;00:06:47,079;Couldn't resist
84;00:06:44,510;00:06:47,079;some Northern ass?
85;00:06:47,113;00:06:49,882;If you like redheads,
85;00:06:47,113;00:06:49,882;ask for Ros.
86;00:06:49,916;00:06:52,785;Come to see me off, Greyjoy?
86;00:06:49,916;00:06:52,785;Kind of you.
87;00:06:52,819;00:06:55,354;Your master doesn't seem
87;00:06:52,819;00:06:55,354;to like Lannisters.
88;00:06:55,388;00:06:58,324;He's not my master.
88;00:06:55,388;00:06:58,324;No, of course not.
89;00:06:58,358;00:07:00,326;What happened here?
90;00:07:00,360;00:07:02,728;Where is Lady Stark?
90;00:07:00,360;00:07:02,728;Why didn't she receive me?
91;00:07:02,762;00:07:05,631;She wasn't feeling well.
91;00:07:02,762;00:07:05,631;She's not in Winterfell, is she?
92;00:07:05,665;00:07:07,866;Where did she go?
92;00:07:05,665;00:07:07,866;My Lady's whereabouts--
93;00:07:07,900;00:07:09,568;My Lady?
94;00:07:09,603;00:07:13,006;Your loyalty to your captors
94;00:07:09,603;00:07:13,006;is touching.
95;00:07:13,040;00:07:16,242;Tell me, how do you think
95;00:07:13,040;00:07:16,242;balon Greyjoy would feel
96;00:07:16,276;00:07:19,211;if he could see his only
96;00:07:16,276;00:07:19,211;surviving son has turned lackey?
97;00:07:20,380;00:07:22,581;I still remember seeing
97;00:07:20,380;00:07:22,581;my father's fleet
98;00:07:22,616;00:07:24,216;burn in Lannisport.
99;00:07:24,251;00:07:26,152;I believe your uncles
99;00:07:24,251;00:07:26,152;were responsible?
100;00:07:26,186;00:07:27,454;Must have been a pretty sight.
101;00:07:27,479;00:07:29,896;Nothing prettier than watching
101;00:07:27,479;00:07:29,896;sailors burn alive.
102;00:07:30,024;00:07:33,393;Yes, a great victory
102;00:07:30,024;00:07:33,393;for your people.
103;00:07:33,428;00:07:37,131;Shame how it all turned out.
103;00:07:33,428;00:07:37,131;We were outnumbered 10 to one--
104;00:07:37,166;00:07:39,200;a stupid rebellion then.
105;00:07:39,235;00:07:41,236;I suppose your father
105;00:07:39,235;00:07:41,236;realized that
106;00:07:41,270;00:07:43,772;when your brothers
106;00:07:41,270;00:07:43,772;died in battle.
107;00:07:43,806;00:07:47,176;Now here you are,
107;00:07:43,806;00:07:47,176;your enemy's squire.
108;00:07:47,210;00:07:49,044;Careful, imp.
108;00:07:47,210;00:07:49,044;I've offended you.
109;00:07:49,078;00:07:52,381;Forgive me, it's been
109;00:07:49,078;00:07:52,381;a rough morning.
110;00:07:52,415;00:07:55,817;Anyway, don't despair.
111;00:07:55,852;00:07:58,287;I'm a constant disappointment
111;00:07:55,852;00:07:58,287;to my own father
112;00:07:58,321;00:08:00,055;and I've learned
112;00:07:58,321;00:08:00,055;to live with it.
113;00:08:00,090;00:08:02,958;Your next tumble with Ros is on me.
114;00:08:02,993;00:08:06,261;I'll try not
114;00:08:02,993;00:08:06,261;to wear her out.
115;00:08:10,633;00:08:13,535;Shoulder, legs.
116;00:08:17,907;00:08:21,509;Leg, shoulder, leg.
117;00:08:22,578;00:08:24,445;Left foot forward.
117;00:08:22,578;00:08:24,445;Good.
118;00:08:24,479;00:08:26,881;Now pivot as you
118;00:08:24,479;00:08:26,881;deliver the stroke.
119;00:08:26,915;00:08:28,583;Put all your weight
119;00:08:26,915;00:08:28,583;behind it.
120;00:08:28,617;00:08:30,951;What in seven hells
120;00:08:28,617;00:08:30,951;is that?
121;00:08:30,986;00:08:33,521;They'll need an eighth hell
121;00:08:30,986;00:08:33,521;to fit him in.
122;00:08:35,791;00:08:37,725;Tell them
122;00:08:35,791;00:08:37,725;your name.
123;00:08:37,760;00:08:39,960;Samwell Tarly,
124;00:08:39,995;00:08:42,296;of Horn Hill--
124;00:08:39,995;00:08:42,296;I mean, I was of Horn Hill.
125;00:08:43,899;00:08:47,268;I've come to take the black.
125;00:08:43,899;00:08:47,268;Come to take the black pudding.
126;00:08:48,129;00:08:49,884;Well, you couldn't be
126;00:08:48,129;00:08:49,884;any worse than you look.
127;00:08:50,439;00:08:52,106;Rast...
128;00:08:53,742;00:08:55,342;See what he can do.
129;00:09:02,950;00:09:05,251;I yield.
130;00:09:05,286;00:09:08,221;Please, no more.
130;00:09:05,286;00:09:08,221;On your feet.
131;00:09:08,255;00:09:10,289;Pick up your sword.
132;00:09:10,324;00:09:12,925;Hit him till he
132;00:09:10,324;00:09:12,925;finds his feet.
133;00:09:22,269;00:09:24,704;It seems they've run short of
133;00:09:22,269;00:09:24,704;poachers and thieves down South.
134;00:09:24,739;00:09:27,607;Now they send us squealing bloody pigs.
134;00:09:24,739;00:09:27,607;Jon!
135;00:09:27,642;00:09:30,210;Again, harder.
136;00:09:30,244;00:09:32,112;I yield!
137;00:09:32,146;00:09:33,647;Enough!
138;00:09:33,681;00:09:36,950;He yielded.
139;00:09:38,519;00:09:40,587;Looks like
139;00:09:38,519;00:09:40,587;the bastard's in love.
140;00:09:43,424;00:09:45,291;All right then,
140;00:09:43,424;00:09:45,291;Lord Snow,
141;00:09:45,325;00:09:48,561;you wish to defend your lady love,
141;00:09:45,325;00:09:48,561;let's make it an exercise.
142;00:09:48,595;00:09:51,698;You two. Three of you ought
142;00:09:48,595;00:09:51,698;to be sufficient
143;00:09:51,732;00:09:54,033;to make
143;00:09:51,732;00:09:54,033;lady piggy squeal.
144;00:09:54,067;00:09:57,136;All you've got to do is
144;00:09:54,067;00:09:57,136;get past the bastard.
145;00:09:59,106;00:10:01,740;Are you sure you want to do this?
145;00:09:59,106;00:10:01,740;No.
146;00:10:15,556;00:10:18,458;Yield yield yield!
146;00:10:15,556;00:10:18,458;I yield.
147;00:10:20,528;00:10:22,229;We're done
147;00:10:20,528;00:10:22,229;for today.
148;00:10:22,263;00:10:23,997;Go clean the armory.
149;00:10:24,032;00:10:25,798;That's all
149;00:10:24,032;00:10:25,798;you're good for.
150;00:10:29,703;00:10:32,438;Well fought!
150;00:10:29,703;00:10:32,438;Piss off.
151;00:10:36,242;00:10:37,976;Did he hurt you?
152;00:10:38,010;00:10:40,211;I've had worse.
153;00:10:41,380;00:10:44,049;You can call me Sam...
153;00:10:41,380;00:10:44,049;If you want.
154;00:10:44,084;00:10:47,786;My mother calls me Sam--
154;00:10:44,084;00:10:47,786;it's not going to get any easier, you know?
155;00:10:47,821;00:10:50,056;You're going to have
155;00:10:47,821;00:10:50,056;to defend yourself.
156;00:10:50,090;00:10:51,991;Why didn't you get up
156;00:10:50,090;00:10:51,991;and fight?
157;00:10:52,025;00:10:55,328;I wanted to.
158;00:10:55,363;00:10:57,731;I just couldn't.
158;00:10:55,363;00:10:57,731;Why not?
159;00:10:59,534;00:11:01,602;I'm a coward.
160;00:11:03,405;00:11:06,206;My father always says so.
160;00:11:03,405;00:11:06,206;The Wall's no place for cowards.
161;00:11:06,241;00:11:08,308;You're right.
161;00:11:06,241;00:11:08,308;I'm sorry.
162;00:11:08,343;00:11:11,477;I just... wanted
162;00:11:08,343;00:11:11,477;to thank you.
163;00:11:22,155;00:11:24,190;A bloody coward.
164;00:11:24,224;00:11:26,292;People saw us
164;00:11:24,224;00:11:26,292;talking to him.
165;00:11:26,326;00:11:28,461;Now they'll think
165;00:11:26,326;00:11:28,461;we're cowards too.
166;00:11:28,495;00:11:30,195;You're too stupid
166;00:11:28,495;00:11:30,195;to be a coward.
167;00:11:30,230;00:11:32,531;You're too stupid to be a--
167;00:11:30,230;00:11:32,531;Quick now,
168;00:11:32,565;00:11:35,234;before summer's over.
169;00:11:35,268;00:11:37,469;C'mere!
170;00:12:05,730;00:12:09,200;Hyah hyah!
171;00:12:11,904;00:12:15,674;Vaes Dothrak--
171;00:12:11,904;00:12:15,674;the city of the horselords.
172;00:12:17,811;00:12:19,445;A pile of mud.
173;00:12:19,479;00:12:20,947;Mud and shit
173;00:12:19,479;00:12:20,947;and twigs--
174;00:12:20,981;00:12:24,250;best these savages can do.
174;00:12:20,981;00:12:24,250;These are my people now.
175;00:12:24,284;00:12:26,352;You shouldn't
175;00:12:24,284;00:12:26,352;call them savages.
176;00:12:26,386;00:12:28,487;I'll call them what I like,
176;00:12:26,386;00:12:28,487;because they're my people.
177;00:12:28,522;00:12:30,856;This is my army.
178;00:12:30,890;00:12:34,292;Khal Drogo is marching the
178;00:12:30,890;00:12:34,292;wrong way with my army.
179;00:12:53,578;00:12:56,847;If my brother was given
179;00:12:53,578;00:12:56,847;an army of Dothraki,
180;00:12:56,881;00:13:00,617;could you conquer
180;00:12:56,881;00:13:00,617;the Seven Kingdoms?
181;00:13:00,651;00:13:03,353;The Dothraki have never
181;00:13:00,651;00:13:03,353;crossed the Narrow Sea.
182;00:13:03,387;00:13:06,023;They fear any water
182;00:13:03,387;00:13:06,023;their horses can't drink.
183;00:13:06,057;00:13:08,392;But if they did?
184;00:13:08,426;00:13:11,929;King Robert is fool enough
184;00:13:08,426;00:13:11,929;to meet them in open battle,
185;00:13:11,963;00:13:14,898;but the men
185;00:13:11,963;00:13:14,898;advising him are different.
186;00:13:14,933;00:13:19,135;And you know these men?
186;00:13:14,933;00:13:19,135;I fought beside them once,
187;00:13:19,170;00:13:21,304;long ago.
188;00:13:21,338;00:13:23,706;Now Ned Stark wants my head.
189;00:13:23,741;00:13:26,509;He drove me
189;00:13:23,741;00:13:26,509;from my land.
190;00:13:27,745;00:13:29,846;You sold slaves.
191;00:13:31,048;00:13:33,449;Aye.
192;00:13:34,318;00:13:37,320;Why?
192;00:13:34,318;00:13:37,320;I had no money
193;00:13:37,354;00:13:39,856;and an expensive wife.
194;00:13:39,890;00:13:41,725;And where is she now?
195;00:13:41,759;00:13:43,693;In another place,
196;00:13:43,728;00:13:46,163;with another man.
197;00:13:51,836;00:13:54,571;Your Grace?
197;00:13:51,836;00:13:54,571;Yes, my dear?
198;00:13:54,605;00:13:57,374;They call you
198;00:13:54,605;00:13:57,374;the Last Dragon...
199;00:13:57,408;00:14:00,110;They do.
200;00:14:01,379;00:14:03,548;You have dragon's blood
201;00:14:03,582;00:14:05,483;in your veins?
202;00:14:05,518;00:14:07,552;It's entirely possible.
203;00:14:07,587;00:14:11,156;What happened to the dragons?
204;00:14:11,190;00:14:13,859;I was told that brave men
204;00:14:11,190;00:14:13,859;killed them all.
205;00:14:17,597;00:14:20,232;The brave men
205;00:14:17,597;00:14:20,232;didn't kill dragons.
206;00:14:20,267;00:14:23,035;The brave men
206;00:14:20,267;00:14:23,035;rode them.
207;00:14:23,070;00:14:27,473;Rode them from Valyria
207;00:14:23,070;00:14:27,473;to build the greatest civilization
208;00:14:27,508;00:14:30,043;this world
208;00:14:27,508;00:14:30,043;has ever seen.
209;00:14:30,077;00:14:32,412;The breath
209;00:14:30,077;00:14:32,412;of the greatest dragon
210;00:14:32,446;00:14:34,448;forged the Iron Throne,
211;00:14:34,482;00:14:37,251;which the usurper is
211;00:14:34,482;00:14:37,251;keeping warm for me.
212;00:14:38,553;00:14:41,088;The swords
212;00:14:38,553;00:14:41,088;of the vanquished,
213;00:14:41,123;00:14:43,923;a thousand of them...
214;00:14:43,958;00:14:48,328;Melted together
214;00:14:43,958;00:14:48,328;like so many candles.
215;00:14:51,631;00:14:54,733;I have always wanted
215;00:14:51,631;00:14:54,733;to see a dragon.
216;00:14:56,369;00:14:59,270;There is nothing in the world
216;00:14:56,369;00:14:59,270;that I would rather see.
217;00:14:59,305;00:15:01,472;Really.
217;00:14:59,305;00:15:01,472;Why dragons?
218;00:15:01,506;00:15:04,208;They can fly.
219;00:15:04,243;00:15:07,346;And wherever they are,
219;00:15:04,243;00:15:07,346;just a few flaps of their wings
220;00:15:07,380;00:15:09,982;and they're
220;00:15:07,380;00:15:09,982;somewhere else...
221;00:15:10,017;00:15:12,151;Far away.
222;00:15:14,622;00:15:16,957;And they can kill.
223;00:15:16,991;00:15:21,562;Anyone or anything that
223;00:15:16,991;00:15:21,562;tries to hurt them
224;00:15:21,596;00:15:26,600;gets burned away to nothing...
225;00:15:26,634;00:15:30,203;...Like so many candles.
226;00:15:30,238;00:15:31,404;Ow.
227;00:15:34,007;00:15:36,342;Yes.
227;00:15:34,007;00:15:36,342;Seeing a dragon
228;00:15:36,376;00:15:38,310;would make me very happy.
229;00:15:38,344;00:15:40,913;Well, after 15 years
229;00:15:38,344;00:15:40,913;in a pleasure house,
230;00:15:40,947;00:15:43,148;I imagine just seeing
230;00:15:40,947;00:15:43,148;the sky makes you happy.
231;00:15:43,183;00:15:46,251;I was not locked in.
231;00:15:43,183;00:15:46,251;I have seen things.
232;00:15:46,286;00:15:48,254;What have you seen?
232;00:15:46,286;00:15:48,254;I've seen...
233;00:15:48,288;00:15:52,058;A man from Asshai with a dagger
233;00:15:48,288;00:15:52,058;of real dragonglass.
234;00:15:52,093;00:15:54,228;Ooh.
234;00:15:52,093;00:15:54,228;I've seen a man who could
235;00:15:54,262;00:15:58,667;change his face the way that
235;00:15:54,262;00:15:58,667;other men change their clothes.
236;00:15:58,701;00:16:02,705;And I've seen a pirate
236;00:15:58,701;00:16:02,705;who wore his weight in gold
237;00:16:02,739;00:16:06,875;and whose ship had
237;00:16:02,739;00:16:06,875;sails of colored silk.
238;00:16:06,909;00:16:11,347;So...
239;00:16:11,381;00:16:13,549;Have you seen one?
240;00:16:13,583;00:16:17,086;A pirate ship?
240;00:16:13,583;00:16:17,086;A dragon.
241;00:16:18,021;00:16:20,088;No.
242;00:16:20,123;00:16:23,593;No, the last one died many years
242;00:16:20,123;00:16:23,593;before I was born.
243;00:16:23,627;00:16:26,962;I'll tell you
243;00:16:23,627;00:16:26,962;what I have seen:
244;00:16:26,997;00:16:29,565;Their skulls.
245;00:16:29,600;00:16:32,736;They used to decorate
245;00:16:29,600;00:16:32,736;the throne room in the Red Keep.
246;00:16:32,770;00:16:35,172;When I was very young,
246;00:16:32,770;00:16:35,172;just three or four,
247;00:16:35,206;00:16:37,408;my father used
247;00:16:35,206;00:16:37,408;to walk me down the rows
248;00:16:37,442;00:16:39,176;and I'd recite
248;00:16:37,442;00:16:39,176;their names for him.
249;00:16:39,211;00:16:42,047;When I got them all right,
249;00:16:39,211;00:16:42,047;he'd give me a sweet.
250;00:16:43,716;00:16:46,851;The ones closest to the door were
250;00:16:43,716;00:16:46,851;the last ones they were able to hatch
251;00:16:46,885;00:16:48,686;and they were all
251;00:16:46,885;00:16:48,686;stunted and wrong.
252;00:16:48,720;00:16:51,990;Skulls no bigger
252;00:16:48,720;00:16:51,990;than dog skulls.
253;00:16:52,024;00:16:56,962;But as you got closer
253;00:16:52,024;00:16:56,962;to the Iron Throne...
254;00:16:58,298;00:17:00,332;They got bigger
255;00:17:00,367;00:17:03,435;and bigger and bigger.
256;00:17:06,239;00:17:08,740;There was Ghiscar
257;00:17:08,775;00:17:11,343;and Valryon,
258;00:17:11,377;00:17:13,144;Vermithrax,
259;00:17:13,179;00:17:15,513;Essovius--
260;00:17:15,548;00:17:18,049;Archonei,
261;00:17:18,083;00:17:21,052;Meraxes,
262;00:17:21,086;00:17:24,555;Vhagar...
263;00:17:26,159;00:17:28,961;And Balerion the dread...
264;00:17:28,995;00:17:31,563;...Whose fire forged
265;00:17:31,598;00:17:33,700;the Seven Kingdoms
266;00:17:33,734;00:17:35,969;into one.
267;00:17:40,442;00:17:43,177;What happened
267;00:17:40,442;00:17:43,177;to the skulls?
268;00:17:45,314;00:17:47,048;I don't know.
269;00:17:47,082;00:17:50,384;The usurper had them
269;00:17:47,082;00:17:50,384;smashed to powder, I expect.
270;00:17:51,253;00:17:53,488;Scattered to the wind.
271;00:17:56,491;00:17:59,226;That's very sad.
272;00:17:59,261;00:18:01,095;Yes, it is.
273;00:18:02,697;00:18:04,898;What did I buy you for?
274;00:18:04,932;00:18:08,001;To make me sad?
274;00:18:04,932;00:18:08,001;No, your Grace.
275;00:18:09,103;00:18:12,438;To, uh, teach your sister.
276;00:18:12,473;00:18:14,873;To teach my sister how
276;00:18:12,473;00:18:14,873;to be a better lover?
277;00:18:14,908;00:18:18,810;You think I bought you to make
277;00:18:14,908;00:18:18,810;Khal Drogo happy?
278;00:18:23,249;00:18:26,252;Oh, you pretty
278;00:18:23,249;00:18:26,252;little idiot.
279;00:18:28,288;00:18:30,423;Go on then.
279;00:18:28,288;00:18:30,423;Get on with it.
280;00:18:40,300;00:18:42,935;Someday your husband
280;00:18:40,300;00:18:42,935;will sit there
281;00:18:42,969;00:18:45,237;and you will sit
281;00:18:42,969;00:18:45,237;by his side.
282;00:18:45,272;00:18:50,410;And one day, before too long,
282;00:18:45,272;00:18:50,410;you will present your son to the court.
283;00:18:50,444;00:18:53,012;All the Lords of Westeros
284;00:18:53,047;00:18:55,782;will gather here to see
284;00:18:53,047;00:18:55,782;the little prince--
285;00:18:55,816;00:18:57,617;what if I have a girl?
286;00:18:57,652;00:19:00,587;Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls
286;00:18:57,652;00:19:00,587;and plenty of them.
287;00:19:00,621;00:19:03,222;What if I only
287;00:19:00,621;00:19:03,222;have girls?
288;00:19:03,257;00:19:05,392;I wouldn't worry
288;00:19:03,257;00:19:05,392;about that.
289;00:19:05,426;00:19:08,494;Jeyne Poole's mother had five children--
289;00:19:05,426;00:19:08,494;all of them girls.
290;00:19:08,528;00:19:10,630;Yes, but it's
290;00:19:08,528;00:19:10,630;highly unlikely.
291;00:19:10,664;00:19:13,166;But what if?
292;00:19:13,200;00:19:16,402;Well, if you only
292;00:19:13,200;00:19:16,402;had girls,
293;00:19:16,437;00:19:20,006;I suppose the throne would
293;00:19:16,437;00:19:20,006;pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.
294;00:19:20,040;00:19:22,976;And everyone
294;00:19:20,040;00:19:22,976;would hate me.
295;00:19:23,010;00:19:25,111;Nobody could ever
295;00:19:23,010;00:19:25,111;hate you.
296;00:19:25,146;00:19:27,648;Joffrey does.
296;00:19:25,146;00:19:27,648;Nonsense.
297;00:19:27,682;00:19:30,717;Why would you say
297;00:19:27,682;00:19:30,717;such a thing?
298;00:19:32,186;00:19:34,321;That business with the wolves?
298;00:19:32,186;00:19:34,321;Sansa,
299;00:19:34,355;00:19:36,757;I've told you
299;00:19:34,355;00:19:36,757;a hundred times:
300;00:19:36,791;00:19:39,526;A direwolf is not--
300;00:19:36,791;00:19:39,526;please shut up about it.
301;00:19:40,928;00:19:42,729;Do you remember
301;00:19:40,928;00:19:42,729;your lessons?
302;00:19:44,532;00:19:47,301;Who built the Iron Throne?
303;00:19:47,335;00:19:49,403;Aegon the Conqueror.
304;00:19:49,437;00:19:51,472;And who built
304;00:19:49,437;00:19:51,472;the Red Keep?
305;00:19:51,506;00:19:53,073;Maegor the Cruel.
306;00:19:53,108;00:19:54,975;And how many years
306;00:19:53,108;00:19:54,975;did it take to build--
307;00:19:55,009;00:19:58,045;my grandfather and Uncle
307;00:19:55,009;00:19:58,045;were murdered here, weren't they?
308;00:19:59,547;00:20:02,782;They were killed on the orders of
308;00:19:59,547;00:20:02,782;King Aerys, yes.
309;00:20:02,817;00:20:07,120;The Mad King.
309;00:20:02,817;00:20:07,120;Commonly known as the Mad King.
310;00:20:07,154;00:20:09,588;Why were they killed?
311;00:20:10,990;00:20:13,858;You should be speak to your
311;00:20:10,990;00:20:13,858;father about these matters.
312;00:20:13,893;00:20:15,893;I don't want to speak
312;00:20:13,893;00:20:15,893;to my father-- ever.
313;00:20:15,928;00:20:19,397;Sansa, you will
313;00:20:15,928;00:20:19,397;find it in your heart
314;00:20:19,431;00:20:20,932;to forgive your father.
315;00:20:20,966;00:20:22,733;No, I won't.
316;00:20:22,767;00:20:25,035;It's The Hand's
316;00:20:22,767;00:20:25,035;tournament that's causing
317;00:20:25,070;00:20:27,738;all this trouble, My Lords.
317;00:20:25,070;00:20:27,738;The King's tournament.
318;00:20:27,773;00:20:31,408;I assure you The Hand
318;00:20:27,773;00:20:31,408;wants no part of it.
319;00:20:31,443;00:20:33,677;Call it what you will,
319;00:20:31,443;00:20:33,677;Lord Stark, Ser,
320;00:20:33,712;00:20:36,980;the city is packed with people
320;00:20:33,712;00:20:36,980;and more flooding in every day.
321;00:20:37,015;00:20:40,183;Last night we had a tavern riot,
321;00:20:37,015;00:20:40,183;a brothel fire,
322;00:20:40,217;00:20:43,120;three stabbings and a drunken horse race
322;00:20:40,217;00:20:43,120;down the Street of Sisters.
323;00:20:43,154;00:20:45,989;Dreadful.
323;00:20:43,154;00:20:45,989;If you can't keep the King's peace,
324;00:20:46,024;00:20:49,059;perhaps the city watch should be
324;00:20:46,024;00:20:49,059;commanded by someone who can.
325;00:20:49,094;00:20:50,794;I need more men.
325;00:20:49,094;00:20:50,794;Ned: You'll get 50.
326;00:20:50,828;00:20:53,764;Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
326;00:20:50,828;00:20:53,764;I will?
327;00:20:53,798;00:20:55,499;You found money
327;00:20:53,798;00:20:55,499;for a champion's purse,
328;00:20:55,533;00:20:57,434;you can find money
328;00:20:55,533;00:20:57,434;to keep the peace.
329;00:20:59,237;00:21:01,305;I'll also give you
329;00:20:59,237;00:21:01,305;20 of my household guard
330;00:21:01,339;00:21:03,139;till the crowds
330;00:21:01,339;00:21:03,139;have left.
331;00:21:03,173;00:21:04,808;Thank you,
331;00:21:03,173;00:21:04,808;My Lord Hand, Ser.
332;00:21:04,842;00:21:06,576;They will be put
332;00:21:04,842;00:21:06,576;to good use.
333;00:21:08,812;00:21:10,847;The sooner this is over,
333;00:21:08,812;00:21:10,847;the better.
334;00:21:10,881;00:21:13,850;The realm prospers
334;00:21:10,881;00:21:13,850;from such events, My Lord.
335;00:21:13,884;00:21:16,052;They give the great
335;00:21:13,884;00:21:16,052;a chance at glory,
336;00:21:16,086;00:21:18,354;and the lowly a respite
336;00:21:16,086;00:21:18,354;from their woes.
337;00:21:18,389;00:21:20,824;And every inn in
337;00:21:18,389;00:21:20,824;the city is full
338;00:21:20,858;00:21:22,892;and the whores
338;00:21:20,858;00:21:22,892;are walking bow-legged.
339;00:21:22,927;00:21:25,395;I'm sure the tourney
339;00:21:22,927;00:21:25,395;puts coins in many a pocket.
340;00:21:25,429;00:21:27,964;Hmmm.
340;00:21:25,429;00:21:27,964;Now...
341;00:21:27,999;00:21:30,567;If there's nothing else,
341;00:21:27,999;00:21:30,567;My Lords?
342;00:21:40,111;00:21:42,612;Oh, this heat.
343;00:21:42,647;00:21:45,448;On days like this,
343;00:21:42,647;00:21:45,448;I envy you Northerners
344;00:21:45,483;00:21:47,217;your summer snows.
345;00:21:47,258;00:21:48,265;Until tomorrow, My Lord--
346;00:21:48,290;00:21:50,662;I've been hoping to talk
346;00:21:48,290;00:21:50,662;to you about Jon Arryn.
347;00:21:50,855;00:21:53,723;Lord Arryn?
348;00:21:53,757;00:21:55,925;Oh, his death was
349;00:21:55,960;00:21:58,694;a great sadness
349;00:21:55,960;00:21:58,694;to all of us.
350;00:21:58,729;00:22:00,963;I took personal charge
350;00:21:58,729;00:22:00,963;of his care,
351;00:22:00,997;00:22:03,666;but I could not
351;00:22:00,997;00:22:03,666;save him.
352;00:22:03,700;00:22:05,969;His sickness struck him
353;00:22:06,003;00:22:09,439;very hard and very fast.
354;00:22:10,341;00:22:12,009;I saw him in my chambers
355;00:22:12,043;00:22:13,978;just the night
355;00:22:12,043;00:22:13,978;before he passed.
356;00:22:14,012;00:22:17,181;Lord Jon often came
356;00:22:14,012;00:22:17,181;to me for counsel.
357;00:22:17,216;00:22:19,952;Why?
358;00:22:19,986;00:22:23,555;I have been Grand Maester
358;00:22:19,986;00:22:23,555;for many years.
359;00:22:23,589;00:22:27,025;Kings and Hands have come to me
359;00:22:23,589;00:22:27,025;for advice since--
360;00:22:27,060;00:22:29,962;What did Jon want
360;00:22:27,060;00:22:29,962;the night before he died?
361;00:22:29,996;00:22:32,431;Oh, he came inquiring
361;00:22:29,996;00:22:32,431;after a book.
362;00:22:32,465;00:22:34,200;A book?
363;00:22:34,234;00:22:35,868;What book?
364;00:22:35,902;00:22:37,603;Oh, I fear
365;00:22:37,638;00:22:40,407;it would be of little interest
365;00:22:37,638;00:22:40,407;to you, My Lord.
366;00:22:40,441;00:22:42,909;A ponderous Tome.
367;00:22:42,944;00:22:46,513;No, I'd like to read it.
368;00:22:49,050;00:22:51,519;The Lineages and Histories
369;00:22:51,553;00:22:54,723;of the Great H

370;00:22:54,757;00:22:58,427;with descriptions
370;00:22:54,757;00:22:58,427;of many high lords
371;00:22:58,461;00:23:01,564;and noble ladies
372;00:23:01,598;00:23:03,732;and their children.
373;00:23:20,914;00:23:23,316;Harkon Umber,
373;00:23:20,914;00:23:23,316;first of his name,
374;00:23:23,350;00:23:27,153;born to Lord Hother Umber
374;00:23:23,350;00:23:27,153;and Lady Amaryllis Umber
375;00:23:27,187;00:23:29,722;in the 183rd year
375;00:23:27,187;00:23:29,722;after Aegon's landing,
376;00:23:29,757;00:23:33,060;at the last hearth.
376;00:23:29,757;00:23:33,060;Blue of eye, brown of hair
377;00:23:33,094;00:23:36,597;and fair complected,
377;00:23:33,094;00:23:36,597;died in his 14th year
378;00:23:36,632;00:23:38,867;of a wound sustained
378;00:23:36,632;00:23:38,867;in a bear hunt.
379;00:23:38,901;00:23:42,671;As I said, My Lord,
379;00:23:38,901;00:23:42,671;a ponderous read.
380;00:23:42,705;00:23:45,540;Did Jon Arryn tell you
380;00:23:42,705;00:23:45,540;what he wanted with it?
381;00:23:45,574;00:23:48,343;He did not, My Lord.
381;00:23:45,574;00:23:48,343;And I did not presume to ask.
382;00:23:48,377;00:23:51,011;Jon's death...
382;00:23:48,377;00:23:51,011;Such a tragedy.
383;00:23:51,046;00:23:53,380;...Did he say anything to you
383;00:23:51,046;00:23:53,380;during his final hours?
384;00:23:53,415;00:23:55,215;Nothing of import,
384;00:23:53,415;00:23:55,215;My Lord.
385;00:23:55,249;00:23:58,051;Oh-- there was one phrase
386;00:23:58,085;00:23:59,919;he kept repeating:
387;00:23:59,953;00:24:03,422;The seed is strong,
387;00:23:59,953;00:24:03,422;I think it was.
388;00:24:03,457;00:24:05,759;The seed is strong?
388;00:24:03,457;00:24:05,759;Mm.
389;00:24:05,793;00:24:08,028;What does that mean?
389;00:24:05,793;00:24:08,028;Oh,
390;00:24:08,063;00:24:11,165;the dying mind is
390;00:24:08,063;00:24:11,165;a demented mind, Lord Stark.
391;00:24:11,200;00:24:13,701;For all the weight
391;00:24:11,200;00:24:13,701;they're given,
392;00:24:13,736;00:24:15,804;last words are usually
393;00:24:15,838;00:24:17,907;as significant
393;00:24:15,838;00:24:17,907;as first words.
394;00:24:17,941;00:24:20,876;And you're quite certain
394;00:24:17,941;00:24:20,876;he died of a natural illness?
395;00:24:20,911;00:24:23,212;What else could it be?
396;00:24:24,114;00:24:25,748;Poison.
397;00:24:25,782;00:24:28,451;A disturbing thought.
398;00:24:28,485;00:24:30,653;No no no, I don't
398;00:24:28,485;00:24:30,653;think it likely.
399;00:24:30,687;00:24:33,088;The Hand
399;00:24:30,687;00:24:33,088;was loved by all.
400;00:24:33,123;00:24:35,124;What sort of man
400;00:24:33,123;00:24:35,124;would dare--
401;00:24:35,158;00:24:38,027;I've heard it said that poison
401;00:24:35,158;00:24:38,027;is a woman's weapon.
402;00:24:38,061;00:24:40,529;Yes, women,
403;00:24:40,564;00:24:42,464;cravens...
404;00:24:42,498;00:24:45,166;And eunuchs.
405;00:24:45,201;00:24:48,604;Did you know that
405;00:24:45,201;00:24:48,604;Lord Varys is a eunuch?
406;00:24:48,638;00:24:50,105;Everybody knows that.
407;00:24:50,139;00:24:52,374;Yes yes, of course.
408;00:24:52,408;00:24:55,844;How that sort of person
408;00:24:52,408;00:24:55,844;found himself
409;00:24:55,879;00:24:58,513;on the King's Council,
409;00:24:55,879;00:24:58,513;I will never know.
410;00:24:58,548;00:25:00,248;I've taken enough
410;00:24:58,548;00:25:00,248;of your time.
411;00:25:00,283;00:25:02,885;No trouble at all, My Lord.
411;00:25:00,283;00:25:02,885;It's a great honor--
412;00:25:02,919;00:25:04,653;thank you.
413;00:25:04,688;00:25:06,622;I'll find my own way out.
414;00:25:29,148;00:25:31,183;Syrio says a water dancer
415;00:25:31,217;00:25:32,917;can stand on one toe
415;00:25:31,217;00:25:32,917;for hours.
416;00:25:32,952;00:25:35,754;It's a hard fall
416;00:25:32,952;00:25:35,754;down these steps.
417;00:25:35,788;00:25:37,756;Syrio says every hurt
417;00:25:35,788;00:25:37,756;is a lesson
418;00:25:37,791;00:25:39,992;and every lesson
418;00:25:37,791;00:25:39,992;makes you better.
419;00:25:41,528;00:25:44,530;Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
419;00:25:41,528;00:25:44,530;Cats?
420;00:25:44,565;00:25:46,065;Syrio says.
421;00:25:46,099;00:25:48,167;He says every swordsman
421;00:25:46,099;00:25:48,167;should study cats.
422;00:25:48,202;00:25:51,238;They're quiet as shadows
422;00:25:48,202;00:25:51,238;and as light as feathers.
423;00:25:51,272;00:25:53,540;You have to be
423;00:25:51,272;00:25:53,540;quick to catch them.
424;00:25:53,575;00:25:55,410;He's right about that.
425;00:25:55,444;00:25:56,878;Now that Bran's awake
426;00:25:56,912;00:25:59,715;will he come
426;00:25:56,912;00:25:59,715;live with us?
427;00:26:01,484;00:26:04,687;Well, he needs to get
427;00:26:01,484;00:26:04,687;his strength back first.
428;00:26:04,721;00:26:07,189;He wants to be
428;00:26:04,721;00:26:07,189;a knight of the Kingsguard.
429;00:26:07,223;00:26:11,594;He can't be one now, can he?
429;00:26:07,223;00:26:11,594;No.
430;00:26:13,430;00:26:15,564;But someday
431;00:26:15,599;00:26:17,900;he could be
431;00:26:15,599;00:26:17,900;Lord of a Holdfast
432;00:26:17,934;00:26:20,168;or sit on
432;00:26:17,934;00:26:20,168;the King's Council.
433;00:26:20,203;00:26:22,605;Or he might raise castles
434;00:26:22,639;00:26:25,173;like Brandon the builder.
435;00:26:25,208;00:26:27,943;Can I be Lord
435;00:26:25,208;00:26:27,943;of a Holdfast?
436;00:26:32,314;00:26:35,316;You will marry
436;00:26:32,314;00:26:35,316;a high lord
437;00:26:35,350;00:26:37,351;and rule his castle.
438;00:26:37,385;00:26:39,752;And your sons
438;00:26:37,385;00:26:39,752;shall be knights
439;00:26:39,787;00:26:42,388;and princes and lords.
440;00:26:43,791;00:26:46,459;Hmm?
440;00:26:43,791;00:26:46,459;No.
441;00:26:47,394;00:26:49,862;That's not me.
442;00:27:11,987;00:27:14,121;Hello.
443;00:27:15,624;00:27:18,225;Ser Alliser said I'm to be
443;00:27:15,624;00:27:18,225;your new Watch partner.
444;00:27:20,395;00:27:21,929;I should warn you,
445;00:27:21,963;00:27:24,832;I don't see
445;00:27:21,963;00:27:24,832;all that well.
446;00:27:26,000;00:27:28,002;Come stand by the fire.
447;00:27:29,371;00:27:31,606;It's warmer.
447;00:27:29,371;00:27:31,606;No, that's all right. I'm fine.
448;00:27:31,640;00:27:34,008;You're not.
448;00:27:31,640;00:27:34,008;You're freezing.
449;00:27:45,854;00:27:48,790;I don't like
449;00:27:45,854;00:27:48,790;high places.
450;00:27:48,825;00:27:50,559;You can't fight.
451;00:27:50,593;00:27:52,361;You can't see.
452;00:27:52,396;00:27:55,732;You're afraid of heights
452;00:27:52,396;00:27:55,732;and almost everything else probably.
453;00:27:57,435;00:27:59,369;What are you
453;00:27:57,435;00:27:59,369;doing here, Sam?
454;00:28:03,742;00:28:07,444;On the morning of my 18th Nameday,
454;00:28:03,742;00:28:07,444;my father came to me.
455;00:28:08,680;00:28:11,048;You're almost
455;00:28:08,680;00:28:11,048;a man now, he said...
456;00:28:12,384;00:28:15,619;But you're not worthy
456;00:28:12,384;00:28:15,619;of my land and title.
457;00:28:16,888;00:28:19,190;Tomorrow, you're going
457;00:28:16,888;00:28:19,190;to take the black,
458;00:28:19,224;00:28:22,526;forsake all claim to your
458;00:28:19,224;00:28:22,526;inheritance and start North.
459;00:28:22,560;00:28:26,964;If you do not,
459;00:28:22,560;00:28:26,964;he said...
460;00:28:27,932;00:28:30,133;Then we'll have a hunt
461;00:28:30,168;00:28:33,203;and somewhere in these woods
461;00:28:30,168;00:28:33,203;your horse will stumble
462;00:28:33,237;00:28:36,073;and you'll be thrown
462;00:28:33,237;00:28:36,073;from your saddle to die.
463;00:28:38,576;00:28:41,111;Or so I'll tell
463;00:28:38,576;00:28:41,111;your mother.
464;00:28:41,146;00:28:43,313;Nothing would
464;00:28:41,146;00:28:43,313;please me more.
465;00:28:48,486;00:28:51,588;Ser Alliser's going to make me
465;00:28:48,486;00:28:51,588;fight again tomorrow, isn't he?
466;00:28:52,757;00:28:54,892;Yes, he is.
467;00:28:54,926;00:28:57,695;I'm not going to get
467;00:28:54,926;00:28:57,695;any better, you know?
468;00:28:59,131;00:29:01,032;Well...
469;00:29:01,066;00:29:02,867;You can't get any worse.
470;00:29:12,643;00:29:15,444;I hear you're reading
470;00:29:12,643;00:29:15,444;a boring book.
471;00:29:15,479;00:29:17,279;Hmph.
472;00:29:17,314;00:29:19,448;Pycelle talks too much.
473;00:29:19,482;00:29:21,383;Oh, he never stops.
474;00:29:21,417;00:29:23,918;Do you know Ser Hugh
474;00:29:21,417;00:29:23,918;of the Vale?
475;00:29:25,054;00:29:27,455;Not surprising.
475;00:29:25,054;00:29:27,455;Until recently,
476;00:29:27,490;00:29:31,025;he was only a squire--
476;00:29:27,490;00:29:31,025;Jon Arryn's squire.
477;00:29:31,060;00:29:33,027;He was knighted
477;00:29:31,060;00:29:33,027;almost immediately
478;00:29:33,062;00:29:35,463;after his master's
478;00:29:33,062;00:29:35,463;untimely death.
479;00:29:35,497;00:29:37,799;Knighted for what?
480;00:29:38,767;00:29:40,401;Why are you
480;00:29:38,767;00:29:40,401;telling me this?
481;00:29:40,435;00:29:42,136;I promised cat
481;00:29:40,435;00:29:42,136;that I'd help you.
482;00:29:42,170;00:29:44,638;Where is Ser Hugh?
483;00:29:44,673;00:29:47,574;I'll speak to him.
483;00:29:44,673;00:29:47,574;A singularly bad idea.
484;00:29:47,609;00:29:49,776;Do you see
484;00:29:47,609;00:29:49,776;that boy there?
485;00:29:49,811;00:29:52,445;One of Varys's little birds.
486;00:29:52,480;00:29:56,282;The spider has taken a great
486;00:29:52,480;00:29:56,282;interest in your comings and goings.
487;00:29:56,316;00:29:58,217;Now look there.
488;00:29:58,252;00:30:00,986;That one belongs
488;00:29:58,252;00:30:00,986;to the Queen.
489;00:30:01,021;00:30:04,156;And do you see that septa
489;00:30:01,021;00:30:04,156;pretending to read her book?
490;00:30:04,190;00:30:07,058;Varys or the Queen?
491;00:30:07,092;00:30:09,794;No, she's one
491;00:30:07,092;00:30:09,794;of mine.
492;00:30:11,496;00:30:14,731;Is there someone in your service
492;00:30:11,496;00:30:14,731;whom you trust completely?
493;00:30:16,800;00:30:20,236;Yes.
493;00:30:16,800;00:30:20,236;The wiser answer was no, My Lord.
494;00:30:21,371;00:30:24,274;Get a message to
494;00:30:21,371;00:30:24,274;this paragon of yours--
495;00:30:24,308;00:30:27,477;discreetly--
495;00:30:24,308;00:30:27,477;send him to question Ser Hugh.
496;00:30:27,511;00:30:31,749;After that, you might want him
496;00:30:27,511;00:30:31,749;to visit a certain armorer in the city.
497;00:30:31,783;00:30:35,386;He lives in a large house at the top
497;00:30:31,783;00:30:35,386;of the Street of Steel.
498;00:30:35,420;00:30:37,822;Why?
498;00:30:35,420;00:30:37,822;I have my observers, as I said,
499;00:30:37,857;00:30:40,358;and it's possible
499;00:30:37,857;00:30:40,358;that they saw Lord Arryn
500;00:30:40,393;00:30:44,296;visit this armorer several times
500;00:30:40,393;00:30:44,296;in the weeks before his death.
501;00:30:45,898;00:30:48,933;Lord Baelish, perhaps I was
501;00:30:45,898;00:30:48,933;wrong to distrust you.
502;00:30:48,968;00:30:50,835;Distrusting me was
502;00:30:48,968;00:30:50,835;the wisest thing
503;00:30:50,870;00:30:53,471;you've done since you climbed
503;00:30:50,870;00:30:53,471;off your horse.
504;00:30:59,944;00:31:03,079;...Two, three,
505;00:31:03,113;00:31:04,914;24, five,
506;00:31:04,949;00:31:07,250;six, 27,
507;00:31:07,284;00:31:09,285;28, 29--
507;00:31:07,284;00:31:09,285;Ser Hugh?
508;00:31:09,320;00:31:10,988;30, 31, 32
509;00:31:11,022;00:31:13,290;Ser Hugh!
509;00:31:11,022;00:31:13,290;As you can see, I'm busy.
510;00:31:13,324;00:31:16,260;I'm here on behalf
510;00:31:13,324;00:31:16,260;of Lord Eddard Stark,
511;00:31:16,295;00:31:18,563;the Hand of the King.
512;00:31:18,597;00:31:19,997;I'm the Captain
512;00:31:18,597;00:31:19,997;of his guard.
513;00:31:20,032;00:31:22,200;I'm sorry, I didn't catch
513;00:31:20,032;00:31:22,200;your name, Ser...
514;00:31:22,234;00:31:24,903;No Ser.
514;00:31:22,234;00:31:24,903;I'm not a knight.
515;00:31:24,937;00:31:28,239;I see. Well, it just
515;00:31:24,937;00:31:28,239;so happens that I am.
516;00:31:32,977;00:31:35,946;He said he'd be glad
516;00:31:32,977;00:31:35,946;to talk to the hand himself.
517;00:31:35,980;00:31:37,814;He's a knight,
517;00:31:35,980;00:31:37,814;you see.
518;00:31:37,848;00:31:39,582;Ah, a knight.
519;00:31:39,616;00:31:42,484;They strut around
519;00:31:39,616;00:31:42,484;like roosters down here.
520;00:31:42,519;00:31:46,188;Even the ones who've never seen
520;00:31:42,519;00:31:46,188;an arrow coming their way.
521;00:31:46,222;00:31:48,090;You shouldn't be
521;00:31:46,222;00:31:48,090;out here, My Lord.
522;00:31:48,124;00:31:51,560;There's no telling who has eyes where.
522;00:31:48,124;00:31:51,560;Let them look.
523;00:31:53,563;00:31:56,398;The former Hand did call on me,
523;00:31:53,563;00:31:56,398;My Lord, several times.
524;00:31:56,433;00:31:59,768;I regret to say he did not honor me
524;00:31:56,433;00:31:59,768;with his patronage.
525;00:31:59,803;00:32:02,337;What did
525;00:31:59,803;00:32:02,337;Lord Arryn want?
526;00:32:02,372;00:32:04,439;He always came to see the boy.
527;00:32:04,474;00:32:06,375;I'd like to see him
527;00:32:04,474;00:32:06,375;as well.
528;00:32:08,310;00:32:10,745;As you Gendry! My lord.
529;00:32:14,549;00:32:16,116;Here he is.
530;00:32:16,150;00:32:18,785;Strong for his age.
530;00:32:16,150;00:32:18,785;He works hard.
531;00:32:18,819;00:32:21,955;Show the hand
531;00:32:18,819;00:32:21,955;the helmet you made, lad.
532;00:32:35,804;00:32:38,573;This is fine work.
532;00:32:35,804;00:32:38,573;It's not for sale.
533;00:32:38,607;00:32:40,508;Boy, this is
533;00:32:38,607;00:32:40,508;the King's Hand!
534;00:32:40,543;00:32:43,946;If his lordship wants the helm--
534;00:32:40,543;00:32:43,946;I made it for me.
535;00:32:43,980;00:32:46,615;Forgive him, My Lord.
535;00:32:43,980;00:32:46,615;There's nothing to forgive.
536;00:32:48,117;00:32:50,852;When Lord Arryn came to visit you,
536;00:32:48,117;00:32:50,852;what would you talk about?
537;00:32:50,886;00:32:53,388;He just asked me questions
537;00:32:50,886;00:32:53,388;is all, My Lord.
538;00:32:53,422;00:32:55,590;What kind
538;00:32:53,422;00:32:55,590;of questions?
539;00:32:57,693;00:32:59,994;About my work at first,
540;00:33:00,028;00:33:03,631;if I was being treated well,
540;00:33:00,028;00:33:03,631;if I liked it here.
541;00:33:05,367;00:33:07,602;But then he started
541;00:33:05,367;00:33:07,602;asking me about my mother.
542;00:33:08,971;00:33:12,039;Your mother?
542;00:33:08,971;00:33:12,039;Who she was, what she looked like.
543;00:33:12,975;00:33:14,809;What did you tell him?
544;00:33:16,512;00:33:18,580;She died when I was little.
545;00:33:18,614;00:33:20,848;She had yellow hair.
546;00:33:20,883;00:33:23,518;She'd sing to me sometimes.
547;00:33:27,423;00:33:29,291;Look at me.
548;00:33:39,002;00:33:40,937;Get back to work, lad.
549;00:33:42,673;00:33:44,674;If the day ever comes
549;00:33:42,673;00:33:44,674;when that boy
550;00:33:44,708;00:33:46,876;would rather wield
550;00:33:44,708;00:33:46,876;a sword than forge one,
551;00:33:46,910;00:33:49,311;you send him to me.
552;00:33:54,084;00:33:56,118;Find anything?
553;00:33:57,154;00:33:59,955;King Robert's
553;00:33:57,154;00:33:59,955;bastard son.
554;00:34:02,325;00:34:05,027;He likes that.
555;00:34:06,530;00:34:09,366;This is for the King
555;00:34:06,530;00:34:09,366;from Lord Stark.
556;00:34:09,400;00:34:11,635;Should I leave it with--
557;00:34:11,670;00:34:13,404;shhh.
558;00:34:13,438;00:34:15,273;Listen.
559;00:34:15,307;00:34:18,043;Do you hear them?
560;00:34:20,347;00:34:22,581;How many do you think
560;00:34:20,347;00:34:22,581;are in there with him?
561;00:34:22,615;00:34:24,416;Huh?
562;00:34:24,450;00:34:26,251;Guess.
562;00:34:24,450;00:34:26,251;Three?
563;00:34:26,285;00:34:28,586;Four.
564;00:34:30,288;00:34:32,557;He likes to do this
564;00:34:30,288;00:34:32,557;when I'm on duty--
565;00:34:32,591;00:34:35,159;he makes me listen
565;00:34:32,591;00:34:35,159;as he insults my sister.
566;00:34:40,866;00:34:41,689;Forgive me, My Lord--
567;00:34:41,714;00:34:43,715;Why do I have to forgive you?
567;00:34:41,714;00:34:43,715;Have you wronged me?
568;00:34:46,237;00:34:48,038;We've met before, you know.
569;00:34:48,073;00:34:51,042;Have we?
569;00:34:48,073;00:34:51,042;Strange, I've forgotten.
570;00:34:51,076;00:34:54,513;The siege of Pyke.
570;00:34:51,076;00:34:54,513;We fought side by side one afternoon.
571;00:34:54,547;00:34:56,348;Ah.
572;00:34:56,382;00:34:58,417;That's where you got your scar?
572;00:34:56,382;00:34:58,417;Aye.
573;00:34:58,451;00:34:59,852;Oh.
574;00:34:59,887;00:35:01,721;One of the Greyjoys
574;00:34:59,887;00:35:01,721;nearly took my eye.
575;00:35:01,756;00:35:04,725;Vicious sons of whores.
575;00:35:01,756;00:35:04,725;They like their bloodshed.
576;00:35:04,759;00:35:06,927;They stopped liking it
576;00:35:04,759;00:35:06,927;at the end.
577;00:35:06,961;00:35:10,964;That was a proper battle.
577;00:35:06,961;00:35:10,964;Do you remember
578;00:35:10,999;00:35:14,034;Thoros of Myr charging
578;00:35:10,999;00:35:14,034;through the breach?
579;00:35:14,069;00:35:15,602;With his burning sword?
580;00:35:15,637;00:35:17,505;I'll remember that
580;00:35:15,637;00:35:17,505;till the day I die.
581;00:35:17,539;00:35:21,376;I saw the youngest of the
581;00:35:17,539;00:35:21,376;Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.
582;00:35:21,410;00:35:23,778;It was like seeing a shark
582;00:35:21,410;00:35:23,778;on a mountaintop.
583;00:35:23,812;00:35:26,080;Theon?
583;00:35:23,812;00:35:26,080;He's a good lad.
584;00:35:26,115;00:35:27,215;I doubt it.
585;00:35:32,055;00:35:34,590;I'll bet you smell
585;00:35:32,055;00:35:34,590;of blackberry jam!
586;00:35:34,625;00:35:36,993;Let me smell it.
586;00:35:34,625;00:35:36,993;Come here.
587;00:35:39,130;00:35:40,530;Can I leave this
587;00:35:39,130;00:35:40,530;with you?
588;00:35:40,565;00:35:42,199;The message
588;00:35:40,565;00:35:42,199;from Lord Stark.
589;00:35:42,233;00:35:44,568;I don't serve Lord Stark.
590;00:36:07,589;00:36:10,125;Where have you been?
590;00:36:07,589;00:36:10,125;Watch duty.
591;00:36:10,159;00:36:12,527;With Sam.
591;00:36:10,159;00:36:12,527;Ah, prince porkchop.
592;00:36:12,562;00:36:14,696;Where is he?
592;00:36:12,562;00:36:14,696;He wasn't hungry.
593;00:36:14,731;00:36:16,398;Impossible!
594;00:36:16,432;00:36:18,968;That's enough.
595;00:36:24,175;00:36:26,576;Sam's no different
595;00:36:24,175;00:36:26,576;from the rest of us.
596;00:36:26,610;00:36:28,912;There was no place
596;00:36:26,610;00:36:28,912;for him in the world,
597;00:36:28,946;00:36:30,746;so he's come here.
598;00:36:30,781;00:36:33,216;We're not going to hurt him
598;00:36:30,781;00:36:33,216;in the training yard anymore.
599;00:36:33,250;00:36:36,118;Never again,
599;00:36:33,250;00:36:36,118;no matter what Thorne says.
600;00:36:36,152;00:36:39,121;He's our brother now
600;00:36:36,152;00:36:39,121;and we're going to protect him.
601;00:36:39,155;00:36:41,823;You are in love, Lord Snow.
602;00:36:44,293;00:36:47,262;You girls can do
602;00:36:44,293;00:36:47,262;as you please.
603;00:36:47,296;00:36:50,132;But if Thorne puts me
603;00:36:47,296;00:36:50,132;up against lady piggy,
604;00:36:50,167;00:36:52,234;I'm gonna slice me off
604;00:36:50,167;00:36:52,234;a side of bacon.
605;00:37:15,294;00:37:17,996;No one touches Sam.
606;00:37:32,278;00:37:34,613;What are you
606;00:37:32,278;00:37:34,613;waiting for?
607;00:37:44,524;00:37:46,925;Attack him!
608;00:37:55,835;00:37:58,136;You get in there.
609;00:38:02,108;00:38:03,608;Hit me.
610;00:38:05,811;00:38:07,812;Go on, hit me!
611;00:38:09,748;00:38:12,350;I yield!
612;00:38:12,384;00:38:14,352;Yield yield.
613;00:38:14,386;00:38:16,620;I yield.
614;00:38:19,491;00:38:22,493;You think this
614;00:38:19,491;00:38:22,493;is funny, do you?
615;00:38:25,598;00:38:27,098;When you're out there
616;00:38:27,133;00:38:29,834;beyond The Wall
616;00:38:27,133;00:38:29,834;with the sun going down,
617;00:38:29,869;00:38:32,304;do you want
617;00:38:29,869;00:38:32,304;a man at your back?
618;00:38:32,338;00:38:34,640;Or a sniveling boy?
619;00:38:49,089;00:38:51,857;You send this whore
619;00:38:49,089;00:38:51,857;to give me commands?
620;00:38:51,892;00:38:54,426;I should have sent
620;00:38:51,892;00:38:54,426;you back her head!
621;00:38:54,460;00:38:56,361;Forgive me, Khaleesi.
621;00:38:54,460;00:38:56,361;I did as you asked.
622;00:38:56,396;00:38:57,996;Hush now.
622;00:38:56,396;00:38:57,996;It's all right.
623;00:38:58,031;00:39:01,333;Irri, take her and leave us.
623;00:38:58,031;00:39:01,333;Yes, Khaleesi.
624;00:39:04,671;00:39:07,739;Why did you hit her?!
624;00:39:04,671;00:39:07,739;How many times do I have to tell you?
625;00:39:07,774;00:39:09,374;You do not command me.
626;00:39:09,409;00:39:11,175;I wasn't commanding you.
627;00:39:11,210;00:39:13,010;I just wanted to invite
627;00:39:11,210;00:39:13,010;you to supper.
628;00:39:13,045;00:39:15,313;What's this?
628;00:39:13,045;00:39:15,313;It's a gift.
629;00:39:15,347;00:39:18,283;I had it made for you.
629;00:39:15,347;00:39:18,283;Dothraki rags?
630;00:39:18,317;00:39:20,351;Are you going to dress me now?
630;00:39:18,317;00:39:20,351;Please.
631;00:39:20,386;00:39:22,420;This stinks of manure.
631;00:39:20,386;00:39:22,420;All of it.
632;00:39:22,455;00:39:24,826;Stop-- stop it.
633;00:39:24,851;00:39:26,321;You would turn me into one
633;00:39:24,851;00:39:26,321;of them, wouldn't you?
634;00:39:26,325;00:39:27,992;Next you'll want
634;00:39:26,325;00:39:27,992;to braid my hair.
635;00:39:28,026;00:39:30,060;You've no right
635;00:39:28,026;00:39:30,060;to a braid.
636;00:39:30,094;00:39:31,561;You've won
636;00:39:30,094;00:39:31,561;no victories yet.
637;00:39:31,596;00:39:34,731;You do not
637;00:39:31,596;00:39:34,731;talk back to me!
638;00:39:36,033;00:39:38,534;You are a horselord's slut.
639;00:39:38,569;00:39:40,503;And now you've woken
639;00:39:38,569;00:39:40,503;the dragon--
640;00:39:46,143;00:39:49,713;I am a Khaleesi
640;00:39:46,143;00:39:49,713;of the Dothraki!
641;00:39:49,747;00:39:52,116;I am the wife
641;00:39:49,747;00:39:52,116;of the great Khal
642;00:39:52,150;00:39:54,919;and I carry his son
642;00:39:52,150;00:39:54,919;inside me.
643;00:39:54,953;00:39:58,723;The next time
643;00:39:54,953;00:39:58,723;you raise a hand to me
644;00:39:58,757;00:40:01,993;will be the last time
644;00:39:58,757;00:40:01,993;you have hands.
645;00:40:09,802;00:40:11,703;I know for a fact
645;00:40:09,802;00:40:11,703;that some of the officers
646;00:40:11,738;00:40:13,705;go to that brothel
646;00:40:11,738;00:40:13,705;in mole's town.
647;00:40:13,740;00:40:15,540;I wouldn't doubt it.
648;00:40:15,575;00:40:18,009;Don't you think it's
648;00:40:15,575;00:40:18,009;a little bit unfair?
649;00:40:18,043;00:40:20,178;Making us take our vows
649;00:40:18,043;00:40:20,178;while they sneak off
650;00:40:20,212;00:40:22,813;for a little
650;00:40:20,212;00:40:22,813;sally on the side?
651;00:40:22,847;00:40:25,616;Sally on the side?
651;00:40:22,847;00:40:25,616;It's silly, isn't it?
652;00:40:25,650;00:40:28,987;What, we can't defend
652;00:40:25,650;00:40:28,987;the wall unless we're celibate?
653;00:40:29,021;00:40:30,844;It's absurd.
654;00:40:30,869;00:40:32,923;I didn't think you'd be
654;00:40:30,869;00:40:32,923;so upset about it.
655;00:40:34,327;00:40:36,595;Why not?
656;00:40:36,629;00:40:39,090;Because I'm fat?
656;00:40:36,629;00:40:39,090;No.
657;00:40:39,098;00:40:42,210;But I like girls just
657;00:40:39,098;00:40:42,210;as much as you do.
658;00:40:43,337;00:40:45,906;They might not
658;00:40:43,337;00:40:45,906;like me as much.
659;00:40:47,842;00:40:51,111;I've never--
659;00:40:47,842;00:40:51,111;been with one.
660;00:40:52,446;00:40:54,381;You've probably
660;00:40:52,446;00:40:54,381;had hundreds.
661;00:40:54,415;00:40:56,083;No.
662;00:40:58,386;00:41:00,921;As a matter of fact,
663;00:41:00,956;00:41:02,389;I'm the same as you.
664;00:41:02,424;00:41:04,424;Yeah.
665;00:41:04,459;00:41:06,660;I find that hard
665;00:41:04,459;00:41:06,660;to believe.
666;00:41:06,694;00:41:08,996;I came very close once.
667;00:41:09,030;00:41:12,465;I was alone in a room
667;00:41:09,030;00:41:12,465;with a naked girl, but--
668;00:41:12,500;00:41:14,801;you didn't know
668;00:41:12,500;00:41:14,801;where to put it?
669;00:41:14,835;00:41:16,869;I know where to put it.
670;00:41:16,904;00:41:18,938;Was she...
671;00:41:18,973;00:41:21,107;Old and ugly?
672;00:41:22,142;00:41:23,909;Young and gorgeous.
673;00:41:25,545;00:41:27,446;A whore named Ros.
674;00:41:29,415;00:41:31,216;What color hair?
675;00:41:31,250;00:41:34,085;Red.
675;00:41:31,250;00:41:34,085;Oh, I like red hair.
676;00:41:35,654;00:41:37,421;And her, um...
677;00:41:37,456;00:41:39,156;Her...
678;00:41:40,258;00:41:41,858;You don't want to know.
678;00:41:40,258;00:41:41,858;That good?
679;00:41:41,893;00:41:43,660;Better.
679;00:41:41,893;00:41:43,660;Oh no.
680;00:41:45,363;00:41:47,999;So why exactly
681;00:41:48,033;00:41:51,736;did you not make love
681;00:41:48,033;00:41:51,736;to Ros with the perfect--?
682;00:41:51,770;00:41:54,239;What's my name?
683;00:41:54,273;00:41:56,175;Jon Snow?
684;00:41:56,209;00:41:59,512;And why is
684;00:41:56,209;00:41:59,512;my surname snow?
685;00:41:59,546;00:42:02,349;Because...
686;00:42:02,383;00:42:04,951;You're a bastard
686;00:42:02,383;00:42:04,951;from the North.
687;00:42:06,620;00:42:09,022;I never met my mother.
688;00:42:09,056;00:42:12,024;My father wouldn't even
688;00:42:09,056;00:42:12,024;tell me her name.
689;00:42:12,059;00:42:14,694;I don't know if she's
689;00:42:12,059;00:42:14,694;living or dead.
690;00:42:16,697;00:42:19,164;I don't know
690;00:42:16,697;00:42:19,164;if she's a noblewoman
691;00:42:19,199;00:42:20,833;or a Fisherman's wife...
692;00:42:22,535;00:42:24,536;Or a whore.
693;00:42:26,773;00:42:29,141;So I sat there
694;00:42:29,175;00:42:32,378;in the brothel as Ros
694;00:42:29,175;00:42:32,378;took off her clothes.
695;00:42:32,412;00:42:35,982;But I couldn't do it.
696;00:42:36,016;00:42:39,019;Because all I could
696;00:42:36,016;00:42:39,019;think was
697;00:42:39,053;00:42:41,722;what if I got her pregnant
698;00:42:41,756;00:42:43,791;and she had a child,
699;00:42:43,825;00:42:46,760;another bastard named Snow?
700;00:42:51,299;00:42:54,135;It's not a good life
700;00:42:51,299;00:42:54,135;for a child.
701;00:42:54,169;00:42:56,370;Ah, mmm.
702;00:42:59,174;00:43:01,008;So...
703;00:43:01,042;00:43:03,444;You didn't know
703;00:43:01,042;00:43:03,444;where to put it?
704;00:43:09,117;00:43:11,252;Enjoying yourselves?
705;00:43:13,389;00:43:15,190;You look cold, boys.
706;00:43:16,959;00:43:18,493;It is a bit nippy.
707;00:43:18,527;00:43:20,929;A bit nippy,
707;00:43:18,527;00:43:20,929;yeah, by the fire,
708;00:43:20,963;00:43:25,100;indoors.
708;00:43:20,963;00:43:25,100;It's still summer.
709;00:43:26,268;00:43:28,971;Do you boys even remember
709;00:43:26,268;00:43:28,971;the last winter?
710;00:43:30,140;00:43:32,775;How long has it been now?
710;00:43:30,140;00:43:32,775;What, 10 years?
711;00:43:32,809;00:43:34,910;I remember.
712;00:43:34,945;00:43:37,646;Was it uncomfortable
712;00:43:34,945;00:43:37,646;at Winterfell?
713;00:43:37,681;00:43:40,316;Were there days when
713;00:43:37,681;00:43:40,316;you just couldn't get warm,
714;00:43:40,350;00:43:43,185;never mind how many fires
714;00:43:40,350;00:43:43,185;your servants built?
715;00:43:43,220;00:43:46,421;I build my own fires.
715;00:43:43,220;00:43:46,421;That's admirable.
716;00:43:47,957;00:43:50,625;I spent six months out there,
716;00:43:47,957;00:43:50,625;beyond The Wall
717;00:43:50,660;00:43:53,562;during the last winter.
718;00:43:53,597;00:43:56,699;It was supposed to be
718;00:43:53,597;00:43:56,699;a two-week mission.
719;00:43:56,734;00:44:00,169;We heard a rumor Mance Rayder
719;00:43:56,734;00:44:00,169;was planning to attack Eastwatch.
720;00:44:00,204;00:44:03,573;So we went out to look
720;00:44:00,204;00:44:03,573;for some of his men--
721;00:44:03,607;00:44:06,509;capture them,
721;00:44:03,607;00:44:06,509;gather some knowledge.
722;00:44:06,544;00:44:09,512;The Wildlings who fight
722;00:44:06,544;00:44:09,512;for Mance Rayder are hard men.
723;00:44:09,547;00:44:12,581;Harder than you'll ever be.
724;00:44:12,616;00:44:15,050;They know their country
724;00:44:12,616;00:44:15,050;better than we do.
725;00:44:15,085;00:44:17,420;They knew there was
725;00:44:15,085;00:44:17,420;a storm coming in.
726;00:44:18,755;00:44:21,724;So they hid in their caves
726;00:44:18,755;00:44:21,724;and waited for it to pass.
727;00:44:23,293;00:44:25,694;And we got caught
727;00:44:23,293;00:44:25,694;in the open.
728;00:44:25,728;00:44:28,030;Wind so strong
729;00:44:28,064;00:44:30,566;it yanked 100-foot trees
729;00:44:28,064;00:44:30,566;straight from the ground,
730;00:44:30,600;00:44:33,069;roots and all.
730;00:44:30,600;00:44:33,069;If you took your gloves off
731;00:44:33,103;00:44:35,104;to find your cock
731;00:44:33,103;00:44:35,104;to have a piss,
732;00:44:35,139;00:44:37,440;you lost a finger
732;00:44:35,139;00:44:37,440;to the frost.
733;00:44:37,474;00:44:39,808;And all in darkness.
734;00:44:43,046;00:44:45,514;You don't know cold.
735;00:44:45,548;00:44:47,949;Neither of you do.
736;00:44:50,086;00:44:52,721;The horses died first.
737;00:44:54,557;00:44:57,659;We didn't have enough to feed them,
737;00:44:54,557;00:44:57,659;to keep them warm.
738;00:44:59,929;00:45:02,364;Eating the horses was easy.
739;00:45:04,333;00:45:07,435;But later when we
739;00:45:04,333;00:45:07,435;started to fall...
740;00:45:09,171;00:45:11,439;That wasn't easy.
741;00:45:11,473;00:45:15,008;We should have had a couple of
741;00:45:11,473;00:45:15,008;boys like you along, shouldn't we?
742;00:45:20,748;00:45:22,982;Soft, fat boys like you.
743;00:45:23,017;00:45:25,486;We'd have lasted
743;00:45:23,017;00:45:25,486;a fortnight on you
744;00:45:25,520;00:45:28,556;and still had bones
744;00:45:25,520;00:45:28,556;leftover for soup.
745;00:45:31,159;00:45:34,062;Soon we'll have
745;00:45:31,159;00:45:34,062;new recruits
746;00:45:34,096;00:45:37,132;and you lot will be passed along
746;00:45:34,096;00:45:37,132;to the Lord Commander
747;00:45:37,166;00:45:39,301;for assignment
748;00:45:39,335;00:45:43,272;and they will call you
748;00:45:39,335;00:45:43,272;men of The Night's Watch,
749;00:45:43,307;00:45:46,041;but you'd be fools
749;00:45:43,307;00:45:46,041;to believe it.
750;00:45:47,611;00:45:49,478;You're boys still.
751;00:45:49,512;00:45:52,614;And come the winter
751;00:45:49,512;00:45:52,614;you will die...
752;00:45:54,416;00:45:56,750;Like flies.
753;00:46:02,456;00:46:04,825;I hit him.
754;00:46:04,859;00:46:06,760;I hit the dragon.
755;00:46:06,795;00:46:09,230;Your brother Rhaegar
755;00:46:06,795;00:46:09,230;was the Last Dragon.
756;00:46:09,264;00:46:12,167;Viserys is less than
756;00:46:09,264;00:46:12,167;the shadow of a snake.
757;00:46:12,201;00:46:14,069;He is still
757;00:46:12,201;00:46:14,069;the true king.
758;00:46:14,103;00:46:16,104;The truth now:
759;00:46:16,139;00:46:19,408;Do you want to see your brother
759;00:46:16,139;00:46:19,408;sitting on the Iron Throne?
760;00:46:20,310;00:46:21,944;No.
761;00:46:21,978;00:46:24,880;But the common people
761;00:46:21,978;00:46:24,880;are waiting for him.
762;00:46:24,915;00:46:29,251;Illyrio said they are sewing dragon
762;00:46:24,915;00:46:29,251;banners and praying for his return.
763;00:46:29,285;00:46:33,421;The common people pray for rain,
763;00:46:29,285;00:46:33,421;health and a summer that never ends.
764;00:46:33,456;00:46:36,924;They don't care what games
764;00:46:33,456;00:46:36,924;the high lords play.
765;00:46:36,958;00:46:39,793;What do you pray for,
765;00:46:36,958;00:46:39,793;Ser Jorah?
766;00:46:43,864;00:46:46,833;Home.
767;00:46:46,867;00:46:49,035;I pray for home too.
768;00:46:52,373;00:46:55,509;My brother will never take back
768;00:46:52,373;00:46:55,509;the Seven Kingdoms.
769;00:46:57,178;00:47:00,481;He couldn't lead an army
769;00:46:57,178;00:47:00,481;even if my husband gave him one.
770;00:47:03,852;00:47:06,287;He'll never take us home.
771;00:47:25,741;00:47:28,109;Lover's quarrel?
772;00:47:28,144;00:47:29,945;I'm sorry.
772;00:47:28,144;00:47:29,945;Do I...?
773;00:47:29,979;00:47:33,082;Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish.
773;00:47:29,979;00:47:33,082;He's known--
774;00:47:33,117;00:47:34,617;an old friend
774;00:47:33,117;00:47:34,617;of the family.
775;00:47:34,652;00:47:37,855;I've known your mother
775;00:47:34,652;00:47:37,855;a long long time.
776;00:47:37,889;00:47:40,190;Why do they call you Littlefinger?
776;00:47:37,889;00:47:40,190;Arya!
777;00:47:40,225;00:47:43,193;Don't be rude!
777;00:47:40,225;00:47:43,193;No, it's quite all right.
778;00:47:43,228;00:47:46,863;When I was a child
778;00:47:43,228;00:47:46,863;I was very small
779;00:47:46,898;00:47:49,766;and I come from a little spit of land
779;00:47:46,898;00:47:49,766;called The Fingers,
780;00:47:49,800;00:47:51,568;so you see,
781;00:47:51,602;00:47:53,669;it's an exceedingly
781;00:47:51,602;00:47:53,669;clever nickname.
782;00:47:53,704;00:47:56,238;I've been sitting here
782;00:47:53,704;00:47:56,238;for days!
783;00:47:56,273;00:47:58,273;Start the damn joust
784;00:47:58,308;00:48:00,242;before I piss myself!
785;00:48:07,783;00:48:10,352;Gods, who is that?
786;00:48:10,386;00:48:12,888;Ser Gregor Clegane.
787;00:48:12,923;00:48:16,025;They call him the Mountain.
788;00:48:17,461;00:48:20,130;The hound's older brother.
789;00:48:20,164;00:48:23,133;And his opponent?
789;00:48:20,164;00:48:23,133;Littlefinger: Ser Hugh of the Vale.
790;00:48:23,168;00:48:25,569;He was
790;00:48:23,168;00:48:25,569;Jon Arryn's squire.
791;00:48:25,603;00:48:27,270;Lo how far he's come.
792;00:48:27,305;00:48:29,539;Yes yes, enough
792;00:48:27,305;00:48:29,539;of the bloody pomp.
793;00:48:29,574;00:48:31,040;Have at it!
794;00:49:51,059;00:49:54,095;Not what you
794;00:49:51,059;00:49:54,095;were expecting?
795;00:49:56,933;00:50:00,702;Has anyone ever told you the story
795;00:49:56,933;00:50:00,702;of the Mountain and the Hound?
796;00:50:01,905;00:50:04,340;Lovely little tale
796;00:50:01,905;00:50:04,340;of brotherly love.
797;00:50:05,775;00:50:08,644;The Hound was just a pup,
798;00:50:08,678;00:50:11,079;six years old maybe.
799;00:50:11,113;00:50:13,315;Gregor a few years older--
800;00:50:13,349;00:50:16,785;already a big lad, already
800;00:50:13,349;00:50:16,785;getting a bit of a reputation.
801;00:50:16,819;00:50:19,254;Some lucky boys
802;00:50:19,288;00:50:22,457;just born with a talent
802;00:50:19,288;00:50:22,457;for violence.
803;00:50:23,826;00:50:27,129;One evening Gregor found
803;00:50:23,826;00:50:27,129;his little brother
804;00:50:27,163;00:50:29,799;playing with a toy
804;00:50:27,163;00:50:29,799;by the fire--
805;00:50:29,833;00:50:32,034;Gregor's toy,
806;00:50:32,068;00:50:34,470;a wooden knight.
807;00:50:34,504;00:50:36,972;Gregor never said a word,
808;00:50:37,007;00:50:39,775;he just grabbed his brother
808;00:50:37,007;00:50:39,775;by the scruff of his neck
809;00:50:39,810;00:50:43,012;and shoved his face
809;00:50:39,810;00:50:43,012;into the burning coals.
810;00:50:43,046;00:50:45,281;Held him there
811;00:50:45,315;00:50:47,283;while the boy screamed,
812;00:50:47,317;00:50:49,718;while his face melted.
813;00:50:53,823;00:50:56,592;There aren't very many people
813;00:50:53,823;00:50:56,592;who know that story.
814;00:50:56,627;00:50:59,295;I won't tell anyone.
814;00:50:56,627;00:50:59,295;I promise.
815;00:50:59,329;00:51:01,230;No, please don't.
816;00:51:01,265;00:51:03,699;If the Hound so much as
816;00:51:01,265;00:51:03,699;heard you mention it,
817;00:51:03,733;00:51:06,735;I'm afraid all the knights
817;00:51:03,733;00:51:06,735;in King's Landing
818;00:51:06,769;00:51:09,104;would not be able
818;00:51:06,769;00:51:09,104;to save you.
819;00:51:21,748;00:51:24,850;My Lord,
819;00:51:21,748;00:51:24,850;her Grace the Queen.
820;00:51:27,920;00:51:30,522;Your Grace.
820;00:51:27,920;00:51:30,522;You're missing your tournament.
821;00:51:30,556;00:51:33,124;Putting my name on it
821;00:51:30,556;00:51:33,124;doesn't make it mine.
822;00:51:35,161;00:51:38,363;I thought we might put what happened
822;00:51:35,161;00:51:38,363;on the Kingsroad behind us--
823;00:51:38,397;00:51:40,632;the ugliness
823;00:51:38,397;00:51:40,632;with the wolves.
824;00:51:42,802;00:51:45,404;And forcing you to kill
824;00:51:42,802;00:51:45,404;the beast was extreme.
825;00:51:47,040;00:51:50,143;Though sometimes we go to extremes
825;00:51:47,040;00:51:50,143;where our children are concerned.
826;00:51:51,578;00:51:53,379;How is Sansa?
827;00:51:53,414;00:51:55,315;She likes it here.
828;00:51:55,349;00:51:57,083;She's the only
828;00:51:55,349;00:51:57,083;Stark who does.
829;00:51:57,118;00:51:59,619;Favors her mother,
830;00:51:59,653;00:52:01,421;not much
830;00:51:59,653;00:52:01,421;of the North in her.
831;00:52:01,455;00:52:04,858;What are you doing here?
831;00:52:01,455;00:52:04,858;I might ask the same of you.
832;00:52:04,892;00:52:07,060;What is it you
832;00:52:04,892;00:52:07,060;hope to accomplish?
833;00:52:07,094;00:52:10,163;The King called on me
833;00:52:07,094;00:52:10,163;to serve him and the realm,
834;00:52:10,198;00:52:12,932;and that's what I'll do
834;00:52:10,198;00:52:12,932;until he tells me otherwise.
835;00:52:12,967;00:52:15,434;You can't change him.
835;00:52:12,967;00:52:15,434;You can't help him.
836;00:52:15,469;00:52:18,037;He'll do what he wants, which is
836;00:52:15,469;00:52:18,037;all he's ever done.
837;00:52:18,071;00:52:21,039;You'll try your best
837;00:52:18,071;00:52:21,039;to pick up the pieces.
838;00:52:21,074;00:52:23,809;If that's my job,
838;00:52:21,074;00:52:23,809;then so be it.
839;00:52:25,311;00:52:27,747;You're just a soldier,
839;00:52:25,311;00:52:27,747;aren't you?
840;00:52:27,781;00:52:30,516;You take your orders
840;00:52:27,781;00:52:30,516;and you carry on.
841;00:52:31,552;00:52:33,719;I suppose it makes sense.
842;00:52:33,754;00:52:37,090;Your older brother was trained to
842;00:52:33,754;00:52:37,090;lead and you were trained to follow.
843;00:52:37,124;00:52:40,092;I was also trained to kill
843;00:52:37,124;00:52:40,092;my enemies, your Grace.
844;00:52:43,531;00:52:45,632;As was I.
845;00:53:03,516;00:53:05,484;Seven blessings to you,
845;00:53:03,516;00:53:05,484;goodfolk!
846;00:53:05,518;00:53:07,853;And to you.
847;00:53:07,887;00:53:09,854;Boy!
847;00:53:07,887;00:53:09,854;Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.
848;00:53:09,889;00:53:12,290;Ah, good idea, grandfather.
848;00:53:09,889;00:53:12,290;I'm starving.
849;00:53:12,324;00:53:14,125;A song
849;00:53:12,324;00:53:14,125;while we wait or--?
850;00:53:14,159;00:53:15,960;I'd rather throw myself
850;00:53:14,159;00:53:15,960;down a well.
851;00:53:15,994;00:53:19,630;Now now, grandfather, this may be your
851;00:53:15,994;00:53:19,630;last chance if you're heading North.
852;00:53:19,665;00:53:22,667;The only music the Northerners know is
852;00:53:19,665;00:53:22,667;the howling of wolves!
853;00:53:24,770;00:53:26,437;Gods.
854;00:53:26,471;00:53:27,972;I'm sorry, My Lord.
854;00:53:26,471;00:53:27,972;We're full up.
855;00:53:28,006;00:53:31,008;Every room.
855;00:53:28,006;00:53:31,008;Tyrion: My men can sleep in the stable.
856;00:53:31,043;00:53:33,678;As for myself, I don't
856;00:53:31,043;00:53:33,678;require a large room.
857;00:53:33,712;00:53:36,881;Truly, My Lord,
857;00:53:33,712;00:53:36,881;we have nothing.
858;00:53:36,915;00:53:39,250;Is there nothing I can do...
859;00:53:39,284;00:53:41,853;...To remedy this?
860;00:53:41,887;00:53:43,755;You can have my room.
861;00:53:43,789;00:53:45,323;Now there's
861;00:53:43,789;00:53:45,323;a clever man.
862;00:53:47,226;00:53:49,961;You can manage food, I trust?
862;00:53:47,226;00:53:49,961;Yoren, dine with me.
863;00:53:49,995;00:53:52,097;Aye, My Lord.
863;00:53:49,995;00:53:52,097;My Lord of Lannister!
864;00:53:52,131;00:53:54,232;Might I entertain you
864;00:53:52,131;00:53:54,232;while you eat?
865;00:53:54,266;00:53:57,168;I can sing of your father's victory
865;00:53:54,266;00:53:57,168;at King's Landing!
866;00:53:57,202;00:53:59,836;Nothing would more likely
866;00:53:57,202;00:53:59,836;ruin my supper.
867;00:54:00,805;00:54:02,472;Lady Stark!
868;00:54:02,506;00:54:05,208;What an unexpected
868;00:54:02,506;00:54:05,208;pleasure.
869;00:54:06,577;00:54:08,778;I was sorry to have
869;00:54:06,577;00:54:08,778;missed you at Winterfell.
870;00:54:08,813;00:54:10,680;Lady Stark!
871;00:54:18,522;00:54:20,690;I was still Catelyn Tully
872;00:54:20,725;00:54:23,226;the last time
872;00:54:20,725;00:54:23,226;I stayed here.
873;00:54:25,597;00:54:28,365;You, Ser,
874;00:54:28,399;00:54:32,636;is that the black bat of Harrenhal
