1;00:02:36,240;00:02:37,532;I've taken your castle.
2;00:02:39,409;00:02:41,577;Theon?
2;00:02:39,409;00:02:41,577;It's Prince Theon now.
3;00:02:42,079;00:02:43,996;Get up. You have to get dressed.
4;00:02:45,457;00:02:47,208;I've taken Winterfell.
5;00:02:47,501;00:02:49,585;I took it. I'm occupying it.
6;00:02:49,878;00:02:52,755;I sent men over the walls
6;00:02:49,878;00:02:52,755;with grappling claws and ropes.
7;00:02:52,840;00:02:55,675;Why?
7;00:02:52,840;00:02:55,675;To take the castle.
8;00:02:56,260;00:02:59,345;You went with Robb.
8;00:02:56,260;00:02:59,345;And he sent me back to Pyke.
9;00:03:00,681;00:03:04,225;I'm a Greyjoy.
9;00:03:00,681;00:03:04,225;I can't fight for Robb and my father both.
10;00:03:06,019;00:03:08,020;Where's Hodor?
10;00:03:06,019;00:03:08,020;I don't know.
11;00:03:08,605;00:03:10,231;Find the halfwit.
12;00:03:10,983;00:03:14,360;My men are bringing your people
12;00:03:10,983;00:03:14,360;together in the courtyard.
13;00:03:14,444;00:03:16,904;Why?
13;00:03:14,444;00:03:16,904;So you and I can go down and tell them
14;00:03:16,989;00:03:19,615;how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
14;00:03:16,989;00:03:19,615;I won't.
15;00:03:20,826;00:03:22,535;Yes, you will.
16;00:03:22,619;00:03:25,079;I won't. I'll never yield.
17;00:03:25,455;00:03:27,415;We'll fight you and throw you out.
18;00:03:33,297;00:03:35,047;The castle is mine.
19;00:03:35,132;00:03:37,258;But these people are still yours.
20;00:03:37,342;00:03:39,510;You'll yield to keep them safe,
21;00:03:39,595;00:03:41,304;to keep them alive.
22;00:03:42,306;00:03:44,223;That's what a good lord would do.
23;00:03:47,811;00:03:50,438;Think carefully about what you want to say.
24;00:03:53,609;00:03:54,775;Theon.
25;00:03:55,694;00:03:57,028;Did you hate us the whole time?
26;00:04:05,495;00:04:07,622;I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.
27;00:04:07,706;00:04:08,831;Louder.
28;00:04:09,374;00:04:11,000;Say Prince Theon.
29;00:04:11,418;00:04:14,086;I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon.
30;00:04:14,755;00:04:15,838;You all know me.
31;00:04:15,923;00:04:18,591;Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit.
32;00:04:18,675;00:04:20,343;Farlen, you be silent.
33;00:04:20,802;00:04:23,137;Listen to your little lord, Farlen.
34;00:04:23,513;00:04:25,306;He has more sense than you do.
35;00:04:25,557;00:04:27,475;All of you should do as he commands.
36;00:04:27,559;00:04:31,020;My father has donned
36;00:04:27,559;00:04:31,020;the ancient crown of Salt and Rock
37;00:04:31,438;00:04:34,440;and declared himself King of the Iron Islands.
38;00:04:34,900;00:04:38,027;He claims the North as well
38;00:04:34,900;00:04:38,027;by right of conquest.
39;00:04:38,487;00:04:40,613;You are all his subjects.
39;00:04:38,487;00:04:40,613;Bugger that.
40;00:04:40,697;00:04:42,531;I serve the Starks.
41;00:04:42,616;00:04:45,952;If you think you can hold the North with it...
41;00:04:42,616;00:04:45,952;Shut up!
42;00:04:46,036;00:04:49,497;If you serve me as loyally
42;00:04:46,036;00:04:49,497;as you served Ned Stark,
43;00:04:49,581;00:04:52,083;I will be as good to you as he ever was.
43;00:04:49,581;00:04:52,083;Steady.
44;00:04:52,167;00:04:54,293;Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't.
45;00:04:56,505;00:04:59,465;Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke
46;00:04:59,549;00:05:02,051;informing my father of my victory here.
47;00:05:02,678;00:05:04,720;And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister.
48;00:05:05,639;00:05:09,058;Inform her that she's to bring
48;00:05:05,639;00:05:09,058;500 men to Winterfell.
49;00:05:12,813;00:05:15,147;You are a maester of the Citadel,
50;00:05:15,232;00:05:18,192;sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell,
50;00:05:15,232;00:05:18,192;are you not?
51;00:05:18,819;00:05:19,819;I am.
52;00:05:20,070;00:05:23,280;I am the Lord of Winterfell
52;00:05:20,070;00:05:23,280;as Bran just informed you.
53;00:05:25,450;00:05:26,742;Send the ravens.
54;00:05:29,287;00:05:30,663;My lord.
55;00:05:33,000;00:05:34,583;My Lord Greyjoy.
56;00:05:36,253;00:05:39,630;I see you've finally learned
56;00:05:36,253;00:05:39,630;how to address your betters.
57;00:05:40,632;00:05:41,674;What do you want?
58;00:05:41,758;00:05:43,843;I was brought here a captive.
59;00:05:44,094;00:05:46,262;You were here the day I was taken.
60;00:05:46,346;00:05:48,931;I'm the one who took you. What of it?
61;00:05:50,684;00:05:52,309;Let me serve you.
62;00:05:53,270;00:05:54,645;Serve me how?
63;00:05:55,355;00:05:57,273;I need fighters, not kitchen sluts.
64;00:05:57,357;00:06:00,109;It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens.
65;00:06:01,278;00:06:03,320;Put a spear in my hand again.
66;00:06:03,780;00:06:07,324;So you can bury it in my neck?
66;00:06:03,780;00:06:07,324;Do you take me for a fool?
67;00:06:07,868;00:06:09,035;Get up.
68;00:06:09,578;00:06:10,995;Step aside.
69;00:06:12,789;00:06:13,873;Why?
70;00:06:15,500;00:06:17,251;It's your dream, little lord.
71;00:06:18,086;00:06:20,671;The ocean has come to swallow this place.
72;00:06:21,131;00:06:22,214;I ain't letting it drown me.
73;00:06:22,299;00:06:23,716;You'll all go about
73;00:06:22,299;00:06:23,716;your tasks as usual.
74;00:06:23,800;00:06:26,302;And in a few days' time...
74;00:06:23,800;00:06:26,302;Greyjoy!
75;00:06:34,019;00:06:37,229;We caught this one on his way back
75;00:06:34,019;00:06:37,229;from Torrhen's Square.
76;00:06:37,314;00:06:40,024;Took out two of ours before I got his sword.
77;00:06:40,108;00:06:43,527;Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes.
78;00:06:43,779;00:06:47,198;It grieves me you've less honor
78;00:06:43,779;00:06:47,198;than a back alley whore.
79;00:06:47,657;00:06:50,326;You were raised here under this roof.
80;00:06:50,410;00:06:53,412;These people are your people.
80;00:06:50,410;00:06:53,412;They are not my people.
81;00:06:53,497;00:06:55,623;King Robb thought of you as a brother.
82;00:06:56,917;00:06:58,626;My brothers are dead.
83;00:06:58,710;00:07:01,796;They died fighting Stark men, men like you.
84;00:07:01,880;00:07:05,091;Aye, they died fighting a war
84;00:07:01,880;00:07:05,091;your father started.
85;00:07:05,175;00:07:07,259;Lord Stark raised you among his own sons.
86;00:07:07,344;00:07:09,595;Among them, but not one of them.
87;00:07:09,679;00:07:12,389;I was his hostage, taken from my home.
88;00:07:12,474;00:07:13,724;If he were alive to see this...
89;00:07:13,809;00:07:15,643;He's not. He's dead.
90;00:07:16,311;00:07:18,479;The Seven Kingdoms are at war.
91;00:07:18,563;00:07:20,231;And Winterfell is mine.
92;00:07:20,732;00:07:24,485;I should have put a sword in your belly
92;00:07:20,732;00:07:24,485;instead of in your hand.
93;00:07:25,362;00:07:27,780;You've served this house faithfully, old man.
94;00:07:27,864;00:07:29,615;But keep talking and I'll...
95;00:07:32,202;00:07:34,161;Take him to the cells. Lock him up...
96;00:07:34,246;00:07:35,579;My prince.
97;00:07:36,331;00:07:38,791;You cannot let that stand. He must pay.
98;00:07:39,209;00:07:40,751;I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.
99;00:07:40,836;00:07:43,796;No, he has to pay the iron price.
100;00:07:45,090;00:07:47,341;They'll never respect you while he lives.
101;00:08:05,735;00:08:07,236;Ser Rodrik,
102;00:08:07,320;00:08:08,779;I sentence you to death!
103;00:08:08,864;00:08:11,365;No! You said no harm
103;00:08:08,864;00:08:11,365;would come to them if I yielded.
104;00:08:11,449;00:08:13,576;The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.
105;00:08:13,660;00:08:16,579;I urge you not to make a hasty decision.
106;00:08:17,622;00:08:19,331;He disrespected me
106;00:08:17,622;00:08:19,331;in front of my men.
107;00:08:19,416;00:08:21,083;That was his decision, not mine.
108;00:08:21,168;00:08:23,460;He is worth more to you alive than dead.
109;00:08:23,962;00:08:25,921;The Starks will pay.
110;00:08:27,382;00:08:31,093;Please, Theon, think what you do.
111;00:08:42,230;00:08:45,524;You'll address me as Prince Theon
111;00:08:42,230;00:08:45,524;or you'll be next.
112;00:08:46,526;00:08:48,110;Come.
113;00:08:48,945;00:08:49,945;No!
114;00:08:50,697;00:08:52,615;No!
114;00:08:50,697;00:08:52,615;Theon!
115;00:08:56,912;00:08:58,162;Rodrik!
116;00:08:59,080;00:09:01,665;He who passes the sentence
116;00:08:59,080;00:09:01,665;should swing the sword.
117;00:09:01,750;00:09:03,834;I'm begging you.
117;00:09:01,750;00:09:03,834;Coward.
118;00:09:05,378;00:09:06,378;Stop.
119;00:09:06,755;00:09:08,464;Stop! Stop right now!
120;00:09:10,133;00:09:12,176;You don't give commands anymore, little lord.
121;00:09:12,260;00:09:15,387;Please, stop this. Please stop him.
121;00:09:12,260;00:09:15,387;Hush now, child.
122;00:09:15,472;00:09:17,139;I'm off to see your father.
123;00:09:19,768;00:09:21,936;You said no harm would come!
124;00:09:22,854;00:09:25,439;You said no harm would come. Theon, please.
125;00:09:25,523;00:09:27,233;Any last words, old man?
126;00:09:28,652;00:09:31,487;Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy.
127;00:09:31,571;00:09:33,322;Now you are truly lost.
128;00:09:34,199;00:09:36,575;Theon, please don't. Do something!
129;00:09:36,826;00:09:38,994;I'll do anything, please!
130;00:09:39,079;00:09:40,412;No, please stop it!
131;00:10:12,821;00:10:14,196;Ghost, stay with us.
132;00:10:15,198;00:10:16,365;Ghost!
133;00:10:16,741;00:10:18,075;There goes your pet.
134;00:10:18,868;00:10:20,327;He's not a pet.
135;00:10:20,412;00:10:22,329;No, you're right, he's not.
136;00:10:22,872;00:10:24,081;You can't tame a wild thing.
137;00:10:25,083;00:10:26,834;You can't trust a wild thing.
138;00:10:26,918;00:10:29,503;Ghost is different.
138;00:10:26,918;00:10:29,503;So you think.
139;00:10:30,171;00:10:32,631;Wild creatures have their own rules,
140;00:10:32,716;00:10:34,508;their own reasons.
141;00:10:34,592;00:10:36,260;And you'll never know them.
142;00:10:37,887;00:10:40,347;Now the wildlings we're looking for
143;00:10:40,432;00:10:42,308;sleep during the day and hunt at night.
144;00:10:45,312;00:10:47,521;I thought you said
144;00:10:45,312;00:10:47,521;you couldn't know wild things.
145;00:10:47,605;00:10:49,231;I said you can't.
146;00:10:49,774;00:10:52,776;They find a nice cave to hide in
146;00:10:49,774;00:10:52,776;while the sun's up
147;00:10:52,861;00:10:54,486;and do their killing when it's dark.
148;00:10:54,571;00:10:56,196;We could do the same.
149;00:10:56,281;00:10:57,531;No, we couldn't.
150;00:10:58,408;00:10:59,950;This is their country.
151;00:11:00,035;00:11:02,828;They know where to walk, where not to walk.
152;00:11:02,912;00:11:06,707;I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse
152;00:11:02,912;00:11:06,707;they didn't see till they were in it.
153;00:11:08,335;00:11:10,836;My father always said I'm of the North.
154;00:11:12,630;00:11:15,257;I wasn't joking.
154;00:11:12,630;00:11:15,257;Look around, boy.
155;00:11:16,426;00:11:18,510;This look like home to you?
156;00:11:19,054;00:11:22,181;You start thinking you know this place,
156;00:11:19,054;00:11:22,181;it will kill you.
157;00:11:23,183;00:11:24,933;You understand me?
158;00:11:25,769;00:11:27,269;No, you don't.
159;00:11:27,979;00:11:29,396;We're at war.
160;00:11:30,440;00:11:31,440;We've always been at war.
161;00:11:31,524;00:11:34,068;It's never going to end
161;00:11:31,524;00:11:34,068;'cause we're not fighting an enemy.
162;00:11:34,152;00:11:37,613;We're fighting the North,
162;00:11:34,152;00:11:37,613;and it's not going anywhere.
163;00:11:37,989;00:11:40,449;The Watch has given you a great gift.
164;00:11:40,909;00:11:43,535;You only have one thing to give in return,
165;00:11:43,620;00:11:44,578;your life.
166;00:11:44,662;00:11:48,624;I'll gladly give my life.
166;00:11:44,662;00:11:48,624;I don't want you to be glad about it.
167;00:11:48,833;00:11:52,544;I want you to curse and fight
167;00:11:48,833;00:11:52,544;until your heart's done pumping.
168;00:11:53,088;00:11:55,255;And know this, boy.
169;00:11:55,632;00:11:58,759;Your death will be a gift
169;00:11:55,632;00:11:58,759;for them south of the Wall.
170;00:11:59,469;00:12:01,178;They'll never know what you've done.
171;00:12:01,721;00:12:05,182;They'll never know how you died.
171;00:12:01,721;00:12:05,182;They won't even know your damn name.
172;00:12:05,266;00:12:08,060;But they'll be alive because
172;00:12:05,266;00:12:08,060;some nameless bastard
173;00:12:08,144;00:12:10,646;north of the Wall gave his life for theirs.
174;00:12:11,815;00:12:14,483;Now, do you understand me?
175;00:12:15,735;00:12:16,777;I do.
176;00:12:17,404;00:12:18,612;You're even dumber than you look.
177;00:12:20,156;00:12:22,241;It's just words, boy,
178;00:12:22,325;00:12:24,118;to keep us a little warmer in the night.
179;00:12:24,786;00:12:27,287;Make us feel like we've got a purpose.
180;00:12:28,540;00:12:29,748;Come on.
181;00:12:29,833;00:12:33,419;We've got to find these goat fuckers
181;00:12:29,833;00:12:33,419;before night falls and they find us.
182;00:12:45,682;00:12:47,975;Can you read?
182;00:12:45,682;00:12:47,975;My lord?
183;00:12:49,352;00:12:50,853;Can you read?
184;00:12:54,941;00:12:57,276;This letter detailing our infantry movements
185;00:12:57,360;00:12:59,862;was meant for Lord Damon
185;00:12:57,360;00:12:59,862;of House Marbrand.
186;00:13:00,864;00:13:03,699;It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.
187;00:13:04,242;00:13:05,576;My apologies, my lord. I must have...
188;00:13:05,660;00:13:09,037;Girl, fetch me the History of the
188;00:13:05,660;00:13:09,037;Greater and the Lesser Houses.
189;00:13:09,122;00:13:10,998;It's the one on this...
190;00:13:15,378;00:13:17,713;My cupbearer can read better than you.
191;00:13:27,515;00:13:30,267;To whom does House Dormand
191;00:13:27,515;00:13:30,267;owe allegiance?
192;00:13:33,062;00:13:34,688;My lord, I...
193;00:13:34,772;00:13:37,483;To the Starks of Winterfell!
194;00:13:38,067;00:13:41,737;Who have 20,000 men and my son!
195;00:13:43,573;00:13:47,951;I judged you might be good for something
195;00:13:43,573;00:13:47,951;more than brutalizing peasants.
196;00:13:48,286;00:13:50,287;I see I overestimated you.
197;00:13:51,831;00:13:55,334;If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll...
198;00:13:56,753;00:13:57,753;Leave us.
199;00:14:05,929;00:14:07,346;Put the book away, girl.
200;00:14:14,604;00:14:17,814;Maybe you should devise our next battle plan
200;00:14:14,604;00:14:17,814;while you're about it.
201;00:14:23,655;00:14:25,405;Lord Petyr Baelish.
202;00:14:25,490;00:14:26,490;Mmm.
203;00:14:27,283;00:14:29,284;Give us the room.
204;00:14:37,210;00:14:38,377;Clear all this.
205;00:14:42,715;00:14:44,675;Lord Tywin.
205;00:14:42,715;00:14:44,675;Baelish.
206;00:14:52,976;00:14:55,310;Wine?
206;00:14:52,976;00:14:55,310;Thank you.
207;00:14:58,731;00:15:00,190;What news from the capital?
208;00:15:00,275;00:15:03,652;I traveled here directly
208;00:15:00,275;00:15:03,652;from Renly Baratheon's camp.
209;00:15:04,320;00:15:05,737;Ah, the late King Renly.
210;00:15:06,531;00:15:08,365;Rather a short reign.
211;00:15:08,449;00:15:10,284;Murdered by a woman, I hear.
212;00:15:10,368;00:15:12,286;So they say.
213;00:15:12,370;00:15:17,082;There has been talk of other forces at work.
214;00:15:17,959;00:15:19,501;Dark forces.
215;00:15:21,045;00:15:22,212;Here.
216;00:15:25,300;00:15:29,094;Men love to blame demons
216;00:15:25,300;00:15:29,094;when their grand plans unravel.
217;00:15:30,680;00:15:36,184;It is my belief that a moment of chaos
217;00:15:30,680;00:15:36,184;affords opportunities lost soon after.
218;00:15:36,269;00:15:39,688;You say that as if you were
218;00:15:36,269;00:15:39,688;the first man alive to think it.
219;00:15:39,772;00:15:41,773;Yes, a crisis is an opportunity.
220;00:15:41,858;00:15:44,776;What other brilliant insights
220;00:15:41,858;00:15:44,776;have you brought me today?
221;00:15:44,861;00:15:48,614;After the Lannisters and the Starks,
221;00:15:44,861;00:15:48,614;the Tyrells command the largest host.
222;00:15:48,698;00:15:50,782;Their lands are the most fertile
222;00:15:48,698;00:15:50,782;in the Seven Kingdoms,
223;00:15:50,867;00:15:54,828;feeding horses and soldiers.
223;00:15:50,867;00:15:54,828;Yes, yes, yes.
224;00:15:54,912;00:15:58,332;The Tyrells have not yet declared
224;00:15:54,912;00:15:58,332;for any of the surviving kings.
225;00:15:59,542;00:16:02,961;Loras wants revenge.
225;00:15:59,542;00:16:02,961;He blames Stannis for Renly's death.
226;00:16:03,588;00:16:05,213;And Margaery...
227;00:16:05,757;00:16:07,174;Wants to be queen.
228;00:16:07,800;00:16:09,301;Yes, she does.
229;00:16:11,596;00:16:14,514;House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne.
230;00:16:15,350;00:16:17,976;Against my grandson.
230;00:16:15,350;00:16:17,976;They did.
231;00:16:18,936;00:16:21,480;And perhaps that treason should be punished
232;00:16:21,564;00:16:23,190;one day,
233;00:16:23,274;00:16:26,526;after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated.
234;00:16:29,364;00:16:31,073;More wine for Lord Baelish.
235;00:16:37,497;00:16:40,832;If you will allow me to
235;00:16:37,497;00:16:40,832;represent your family's interests,
236;00:16:40,917;00:16:43,335;I believe that an advantageous agreement...
237;00:16:43,419;00:16:45,879;The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden?
238;00:16:45,963;00:16:47,339;They have.
239;00:16:48,758;00:16:50,509;Pardon, my lord.
240;00:16:50,593;00:16:52,260;It's only wine.
241;00:16:53,513;00:16:55,639;You would ride there yourself?
242;00:16:55,723;00:16:57,474;Tonight, with your leave.
243;00:16:58,017;00:16:59,309;I'll have an answer by nightfall.
244;00:16:59,394;00:17:00,977;That'll be all, girl.
245;00:17:07,235;00:17:08,777;And what else?
246;00:17:08,903;00:17:10,696;On your son Tyrion's directive,
247;00:17:10,780;00:17:12,823;I met with Catelyn Stark.
248;00:17:13,700;00:17:14,866;Why?
249;00:17:14,951;00:17:19,162;He had an interesting proposal for her
249;00:17:14,951;00:17:19,162;concerning her daughters.
250;00:17:19,247;00:17:20,288;Hmm.
251;00:18:10,298;00:18:12,591;A girl.
251;00:18:10,298;00:18:12,591;A wildling.
252;00:18:14,260;00:18:15,594;We could question her.
253;00:18:16,179;00:18:17,804;You could.
254;00:18:17,930;00:18:19,139;She won't answer.
255;00:18:19,807;00:18:22,934;I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue
255;00:18:19,807;00:18:22,934;instead of talking.
256;00:18:24,270;00:18:26,938;What's your name?
256;00:18:24,270;00:18:26,938;Ygritte.
257;00:18:27,023;00:18:30,066;She was reaching for this ax
257;00:18:27,023;00:18:30,066;when you got to her.
258;00:18:30,151;00:18:32,652;Give her half a chance,
258;00:18:30,151;00:18:32,652;she'll bury it in your face.
259;00:18:34,238;00:18:35,864;I gave you my name.
260;00:18:37,825;00:18:38,825;I'm Jon Snow.
261;00:18:47,293;00:18:49,211;You ought to burn them you killed.
262;00:18:49,295;00:18:51,171;We'd need a big fire for that.
263;00:18:52,590;00:18:54,716;Tell me, Ygritte.
264;00:18:55,760;00:18:57,511;Why do you want us to build a big fire?
265;00:18:58,596;00:19:00,639;Are there some more friends in the area?
266;00:19:01,098;00:19:04,059;Burn them or maybe
266;00:19:01,098;00:19:04,059;you'll need those swords again.
267;00:19:04,644;00:19:06,812;Our boy here's already killed one dead man.
268;00:19:06,896;00:19:09,272;He can do it again if he has to.
269;00:19:09,774;00:19:11,608;What waits beyond the pass?
270;00:19:12,193;00:19:13,735;The free folk.
270;00:19:12,193;00:19:13,735;How many?
271;00:19:16,072;00:19:17,739;Hundreds and thousands.
272;00:19:18,282;00:19:20,116;More than you've ever seen, crow.
273;00:19:21,327;00:19:22,994;Why come to the mountains?
274;00:19:23,913;00:19:26,456;What's in the Frostfangs
274;00:19:23,913;00:19:26,456;your king could want?
275;00:19:34,882;00:19:36,424;Do you mean to march on the Wall?
276;00:19:43,140;00:19:44,641;Do you know who I am, girl?
277;00:19:45,643;00:19:47,227;Qhorin Halfhand.
278;00:19:47,895;00:19:48,895;Tell me true.
279;00:19:50,481;00:19:52,566;If your people captured me,
280;00:19:52,984;00:19:54,317;would they take me prisoner?
281;00:19:54,986;00:19:58,446;They'd take your head off your shoulders
281;00:19:54,986;00:19:58,446;if they was feeling kind.
282;00:19:58,990;00:20:01,074;If not, they'd kill you slow.
283;00:20:04,620;00:20:06,538;We have no food for her.
284;00:20:06,622;00:20:08,874;Can't spare a man to watch her.
285;00:20:09,041;00:20:12,168;Can't let her go.
285;00:20:09,041;00:20:12,168;She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us.
286;00:20:12,670;00:20:15,046;It needs to be done. Want me to do it?
286;00:20:12,670;00:20:15,046;No.
287;00:20:17,466;00:20:18,592;No, I'll do it.
288;00:20:20,887;00:20:22,012;Come, brothers.
289;00:20:22,847;00:20:24,306;We'll leave him to it.
290;00:20:24,974;00:20:26,600;We'll meet you at the top.
291;00:20:26,684;00:20:28,351;Don't take too long.
292;00:20:28,436;00:20:29,644;We're deep in their country now.
293;00:20:43,367;00:20:45,869;You never killed a woman before, did you?
294;00:20:46,704;00:20:48,663;You don't need to do it.
295;00:20:49,790;00:20:51,750;Mance would take you. I know he would.
296;00:20:52,335;00:20:54,210;There's secret ways.
297;00:20:54,337;00:20:56,546;The crows would never catch us.
298;00:20:57,757;00:20:59,925;I'm as much a crow as they are.
299;00:21:12,313;00:21:13,939;Will you burn me?
300;00:21:14,565;00:21:16,191;After?
301;00:21:16,817;00:21:18,234;Can't.
302;00:21:19,236;00:21:21,529;Someone might see the smoke.
303;00:21:27,244;00:21:29,579;Strike hard and true,
304;00:21:29,664;00:21:30,872;Jon Snow,
305;00:21:32,208;00:21:33,708;or I'll come back and haunt you.
306;00:21:38,214;00:21:39,547;That's cold.
307;00:21:43,219;00:21:44,469;Go on.
308;00:21:44,971;00:21:46,471;Be quick about it.
309;00:21:54,313;00:21:55,730;Do it.
310;00:21:58,818;00:22:00,360;Bastard, do it!
311;00:23:16,562;00:23:19,147;You can't do it. We both know it.
312;00:23:24,904;00:23:27,197;The sun's going down, Jon Snow.
313;00:23:27,281;00:23:29,282;And your friends are nowhere close.
314;00:23:30,034;00:23:31,159;I'll find them.
315;00:23:32,453;00:23:34,579;Call for them. Go on.
316;00:23:34,997;00:23:36,372;Call loudly.
317;00:23:44,090;00:23:47,092;May the Seven guide the princess
317;00:23:44,090;00:23:47,092;on herjourney.
318;00:23:47,718;00:23:49,469;May the Mother give her health.
319;00:23:50,012;00:23:52,013;May the crone give her wisdom.
320;00:23:52,556;00:23:55,058;May the warrior give her courage.
321;00:24:00,523;00:24:02,607;One day I pray you love someone.
322;00:24:03,484;00:24:05,527;I pray you love her so much,
323;00:24:06,195;00:24:08,238;when you close your eyes, you see her face.
324;00:24:10,699;00:24:12,033;I want that for you.
325;00:24:13,869;00:24:16,579;I want you to know
325;00:24:13,869;00:24:16,579;what it's like to love someone,
326;00:24:17,456;00:24:19,374;to truly love someone.
327;00:24:20,876;00:24:23,086;Before I take her from you.
328;00:24:40,229;00:24:42,981;You sound like a little cat
328;00:24:40,229;00:24:42,981;mewling for his mother.
329;00:24:43,065;00:24:44,440;Princes don't cry.
330;00:24:44,608;00:24:47,235;I saw you cry.
330;00:24:44,608;00:24:47,235;Did you say something, my lady?
331;00:24:48,237;00:24:50,822;My little brother cried when I left Winterfell.
332;00:24:50,906;00:24:52,323;So?
333;00:24:52,408;00:24:53,908;It seems a normal thing.
334;00:24:54,952;00:24:56,536;Is your little brother a prince?
335;00:24:56,620;00:24:57,704;No.
336;00:24:58,455;00:25:00,081;Not really relevant then, is it?
337;00:25:04,295;00:25:05,628;Come, dog.
338;00:25:14,138;00:25:16,014;Hail Joffrey!
339;00:25:16,098;00:25:17,891;Hail to the King.
340;00:25:20,436;00:25:22,520;Seven blessings on you, Your Grace.
341;00:25:22,605;00:25:24,397;Murderer! Bastard!
342;00:25:24,607;00:25:25,899;All hail the King.
343;00:25:25,983;00:25:28,401;He's no king. He's a bastard!
344;00:25:29,820;00:25:31,654;Please, Your Grace, we're hungry.
345;00:25:34,450;00:25:35,867;Freak.
346;00:25:35,951;00:25:37,619;Get the Prince back to the Keep now.
347;00:25:37,703;00:25:39,621;Yes, my lord. Come, quickly.
348;00:25:39,705;00:25:41,998;Please, Your Grace,
348;00:25:39,705;00:25:41,998;give us some food!
349;00:25:42,082;00:25:44,167;Bread, Your Grace, please!
350;00:25:47,671;00:25:49,797;Who threw that?
351;00:25:49,882;00:25:51,382;I want the man who threw that.
352;00:25:51,467;00:25:53,218;Find who did that and bring him to me!
353;00:25:53,302;00:25:55,428;Hold on!
353;00:25:53,302;00:25:55,428;Hold them back!
354;00:25:55,512;00:25:57,388;Just kill them! Kill them all!
355;00:26:03,187;00:26:05,855;Move. Move!
355;00:26:03,187;00:26:05,855;Pull back!
356;00:26:05,981;00:26:07,232;Tear him to pieces!
357;00:26:07,316;00:26:10,109;What are you doing?
357;00:26:07,316;00:26:10,109;I want these people executed!
358;00:26:10,194;00:26:12,028;And they want the same for you.
359;00:26:40,015;00:26:41,307;Where's Sansa?
360;00:26:44,311;00:26:46,521;Through the door.
360;00:26:44,311;00:26:46,521;Come on.
361;00:26:46,730;00:26:47,981;Push hard.
362;00:26:52,361;00:26:53,945;Protect the king!
363;00:26:54,029;00:26:56,114;Get back!
363;00:26:54,029;00:26:56,114;Fall back!
364;00:27:12,715;00:27:13,881;Keep him safe!
365;00:27:13,966;00:27:15,341;Brotherfucker!
366;00:27:16,552;00:27:18,386;Watch out.
366;00:27:16,552;00:27:18,386;Hold them back.
367;00:27:26,520;00:27:27,520;Hey.
368;00:27:29,523;00:27:30,773;Traitors!
369;00:27:31,066;00:27:34,235;I'll have all their heads.
369;00:27:31,066;00:27:34,235;You blind, bloody fool.
370;00:27:34,653;00:27:36,321;You can't insult me.
371;00:27:36,405;00:27:39,490;We've had vicious kings
371;00:27:36,405;00:27:39,490;and we've had idiot kings,
372;00:27:39,575;00:27:42,160;but I don't know if we've ever been
372;00:27:39,575;00:27:42,160;cursed with a vicious idiot for a king.
373;00:27:42,244;00:27:43,786;You can't...
373;00:27:42,244;00:27:43,786;I can, I am.
374;00:27:43,871;00:27:45,330;They attacked me!
375;00:27:45,414;00:27:49,042;They threw a cow pie at you,
375;00:27:45,414;00:27:49,042;so you decided to kill them all?
376;00:27:49,126;00:27:50,835;They're starving, you fool.
377;00:27:50,919;00:27:52,253;All because of a war you started.
378;00:27:52,338;00:27:54,047;You're talking to a king!
379;00:27:55,257;00:27:57,175;And now I've struck a king.
380;00:27:57,259;00:27:58,718;Did my hand fall from my wrist?
381;00:28:00,471;00:28:01,763;Where is the Stark girl?
382;00:28:01,847;00:28:03,014;Let them have her.
383;00:28:03,098;00:28:06,559;If she dies, you'll never
383;00:28:03,098;00:28:06,559;get your Uncle Jaime back.
384;00:28:06,935;00:28:09,395;You owe him quite a bit, you know.
385;00:28:18,405;00:28:19,739;Where are you going?
386;00:28:21,742;00:28:23,951;You ever been fucked, little girl?
387;00:28:25,287;00:28:26,704;Come here.
388;00:28:27,456;00:28:29,123;Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.
389;00:28:29,208;00:28:31,334;I take my orders from the king.
390;00:28:31,627;00:28:33,336;Where?
390;00:28:31,627;00:28:33,336;This way.
391;00:28:41,178;00:28:42,178;Please!
392;00:28:43,430;00:28:44,722;No! No!
393;00:29:03,992;00:29:05,118;Please!
394;00:29:08,997;00:29:11,499;You're all right now, little bird.
394;00:29:08,997;00:29:11,499;You're all right.
395;00:29:26,140;00:29:27,682;We'll get you. We'll get you.
396;00:29:28,392;00:29:29,600;This way.
397;00:29:32,312;00:29:33,813;Are you hurt, my lady?
398;00:29:33,897;00:29:37,066;The little bird's bleeding.
398;00:29:33,897;00:29:37,066;Someone take her back to her cage.
399;00:29:37,151;00:29:39,360;See to that cut.
399;00:29:37,151;00:29:39,360;Well done, Clegane.
400;00:29:41,238;00:29:42,697;I didn't do it for you.
401;00:29:45,325;00:29:46,909;He shouldn't make me wait.
402;00:29:47,411;00:29:50,872;The Spice King is
402;00:29:47,411;00:29:50,872;the second wealthiest man in Qarth.
403;00:29:51,623;00:29:53,374;He makes everyone wait.
404;00:29:53,876;00:29:56,669;Of course, you could have
404;00:29:53,876;00:29:56,669;avoided this embarrassment
405;00:29:56,753;00:29:59,505;if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth.
406;00:29:59,590;00:30:01,340;I already have a husband.
407;00:30:01,425;00:30:03,551;Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi.
408;00:30:04,386;00:30:07,138;You are far too young to be a widow forever
409;00:30:07,222;00:30:10,183;and far too beautiful.
410;00:30:10,267;00:30:14,228;And you are far too smart
410;00:30:10,267;00:30:14,228;to think that I will succumb to flattery.
411;00:30:14,938;00:30:17,356;I have traveled very far in my life
412;00:30:17,441;00:30:19,150;and met many women,
413;00:30:19,234;00:30:20,902;but none that are immune to flattery.
414;00:30:21,069;00:30:23,738;The Mother of Dragons!
415;00:30:23,822;00:30:25,531;Here he comes.
416;00:30:25,616;00:30:28,951;Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night.
417;00:30:29,244;00:30:30,745;Terrible dreams.
418;00:30:31,538;00:30:34,123;I could not sleep until the sun was shining
419;00:30:34,249;00:30:36,334;and the birds were singing.
420;00:30:37,044;00:30:39,462;Look what a beauty you are
421;00:30:39,546;00:30:41,756;now the Red Waste has been washed off you.
422;00:30:42,424;00:30:45,593;I am sorry about all that unpleasantness.
423;00:30:46,094;00:30:49,764;The silver hair of a true Targaryen.
424;00:30:50,432;00:30:52,350;Xaro Xhoan Daxos,
425;00:30:52,434;00:30:55,937;she is far too lovely for
425;00:30:52,434;00:30:55,937;a glorified dockworker like yourself.
426;00:30:56,021;00:30:59,482;Very true, and yet they say
426;00:30:56,021;00:30:59,482;that your grandfather,
427;00:30:59,566;00:31:01,692;who sold pepper off the back of a wagon,
428;00:31:01,777;00:31:05,112;married a lady far lovelier
428;00:31:01,777;00:31:05,112;and higher born than himself.
429;00:31:05,197;00:31:07,406;Every lady alive was lovelier
430;00:31:07,491;00:31:09,700;and higher born than my grandfather.
431;00:31:11,787;00:31:15,373;Did my servants not offer you
431;00:31:11,787;00:31:15,373;something to eat, to drink?
432;00:31:15,457;00:31:16,749;I'll have them flogged in the square.
433;00:31:16,833;00:31:19,210;Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host,
434;00:31:19,294;00:31:21,796;but there is no servant alive
434;00:31:19,294;00:31:21,796;that can bring me what I want.
435;00:31:22,506;00:31:24,382;Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one.
436;00:31:25,259;00:31:28,719;So, my little princess, what is it you want?
437;00:31:29,054;00:31:30,263;My birthright.
438;00:31:30,347;00:31:32,139;The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.
439;00:31:32,683;00:31:35,101;I fear I'm no better
439;00:31:32,683;00:31:35,101;than a servant in this regard.
440;00:31:35,185;00:31:37,186;I cannot give you what I do not have.
441;00:31:37,271;00:31:39,939;I'm not asking you for the kingdoms.
442;00:31:40,023;00:31:41,524;I'm asking you for ships.
443;00:31:41,608;00:31:43,109;I need to cross the Narrow Sea.
444;00:31:43,193;00:31:44,944;I need my ships as well.
445;00:31:45,028;00:31:48,614;I use them, you see,
445;00:31:45,028;00:31:48,614;to bring spices from one port to another.
446;00:31:48,699;00:31:50,616;Whatever you grant me now will be repaid
447;00:31:50,701;00:31:53,160;three times over
447;00:31:50,701;00:31:53,160;when I retake the Iron Throne.
448;00:31:53,245;00:31:54,287;Retake?
449;00:31:55,122;00:31:57,081;Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?
450;00:31:57,165;00:31:59,834;My father sat there, before he was murdered.
451;00:32:00,586;00:32:02,253;But if you did not sit on it yourself,
452;00:32:02,337;00:32:05,673;would it not be correct
452;00:32:02,337;00:32:05,673;to say take the Iron Throne?
453;00:32:06,049;00:32:07,925;I didn't come here to argue grammar.
454;00:32:08,010;00:32:10,511;Of course not. You came to take my ships.
455;00:32:11,680;00:32:14,765;So let me explain my position, little princess.
456;00:32:15,726;00:32:19,020;Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors.
457;00:32:19,104;00:32:20,771;I make my living by trade.
458;00:32:20,856;00:32:23,733;And I judge every trade on its merits.
459;00:32:24,318;00:32:25,901;You ask for ships.
460;00:32:25,986;00:32:28,738;You say I shall be repaid triple.
461;00:32:29,281;00:32:31,782;I do not doubt your honesty
461;00:32:29,281;00:32:31,782;or your intentions.
462;00:32:32,409;00:32:34,118;But before you repay your debts,
463;00:32:34,202;00:32:36,537;you must seize the Seven Kingdoms.
464;00:32:37,122;00:32:38,956;Do you have an army?
464;00:32:37,122;00:32:38,956;Not yet.
465;00:32:39,041;00:32:40,583;You do not have an army.
466;00:32:41,043;00:32:43,336;Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?
467;00:32:43,420;00:32:45,296;There are many there that support my claim.
468;00:32:45,380;00:32:46,422;When were you there last?
469;00:32:47,883;00:32:49,342;I left when I was a baby.
470;00:32:50,093;00:32:52,178;So, in truth, you have no allies.
471;00:32:52,429;00:32:56,682;The people will rise to fight for
471;00:32:52,429;00:32:56,682;their rightful queen when I return.
472;00:32:56,892;00:32:57,892;Ah.
473;00:32:59,102;00:33:00,311;Forgive me, little princess,
474;00:33:00,395;00:33:03,898;but I cannot make an investment
474;00:33:00,395;00:33:03,898;based on wishes and dreams.
475;00:33:04,358;00:33:05,399;Now if you'll pardon me.
476;00:33:05,484;00:33:08,069;Do you know lllyrio Mopatis,
476;00:33:05,484;00:33:08,069;Magister of Pentos?
477;00:33:08,570;00:33:10,905;Yes, we've met. A shrewd man.
478;00:33:10,989;00:33:14,241;For my wedding, he gave me
478;00:33:10,989;00:33:14,241;three petrified dragon eggs.
479;00:33:14,409;00:33:19,163;He believed... The world believed
479;00:33:14,409;00:33:19,163;that the ages had turned them to stone.
480;00:33:19,289;00:33:22,667;How many centuries has it been
480;00:33:19,289;00:33:22,667;since dragons roamed the skies?
481;00:33:22,751;00:33:25,503;But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs
482;00:33:25,587;00:33:27,922;into a great fire, they would hatch.
483;00:33:28,465;00:33:32,343;When I stepped into the fire,
483;00:33:28,465;00:33:32,343;my own people thought I was mad.
484;00:33:32,803;00:33:35,137;But when the fire burned out,
485;00:33:35,222;00:33:37,056;I was unhurt,
486;00:33:37,140;00:33:39,392;the Mother of Dragons.
487;00:33:42,771;00:33:44,188;Do you understand?
488;00:33:47,609;00:33:49,485;I'm no ordinary woman.
489;00:33:50,320;00:33:52,488;My dreams come true.
490;00:33:57,786;00:33:59,620;I admire your passion.
491;00:34:01,540;00:34:04,458;But in business, I trust in logic, not passion.
492;00:34:05,335;00:34:07,044;I'm sorry, little princess.
493;00:34:07,129;00:34:08,838;I am not your little princess.
494;00:34:09,297;00:34:12,341;I am Daenerys Stormborn
494;00:34:09,297;00:34:12,341;of the blood of Old Valyria,
495;00:34:12,426;00:34:14,218;and I will take what is mine.
496;00:34:14,302;00:34:16,679;With fire and blood, I will take it.
497;00:34:16,763;00:34:20,433;Yes, my lady, but not with my ships.
498;00:34:39,202;00:34:41,454;Who taught you to read?
499;00:34:41,788;00:34:43,664;My father, my lord.
500;00:34:43,749;00:34:44,749;Hmm.
501;00:34:46,209;00:34:48,169;I taught my son Jaime to read.
502;00:34:51,214;00:34:54,508;The maester came to me one day,
502;00:34:51,214;00:34:54,508;told me he wasn't learning.
503;00:34:55,302;00:34:57,303;He couldn't make sense of the letters.
504;00:34:58,013;00:34:59,805;He reversed them in his head.
505;00:35:01,016;00:35:03,976;The maester said he'd heard tell
505;00:35:01,016;00:35:03,976;of this affliction
506;00:35:04,060;00:35:06,228;and that we simply must accept it.
507;00:35:06,313;00:35:07,313;Ha!
508;00:35:08,732;00:35:14,320;After that, I sat Jaime down
508;00:35:08,732;00:35:14,320;for four hours every day until he learned.
509;00:35:15,530;00:35:18,365;He hated me for it, for a time.
510;00:35:19,743;00:35:21,452;For a long time.
511;00:35:22,496;00:35:24,038;But he learned.
512;00:35:25,457;00:35:26,457;Hmm.
513;00:35:29,169;00:35:31,629;Where is your father? Is he alive?
514;00:35:35,217;00:35:36,425;Who was he?
515;00:35:36,968;00:35:39,178;A stonemason.
516;00:35:39,888;00:35:41,514;A stonemason who could read?
517;00:35:41,640;00:35:42,640;Hmm.
518;00:35:42,724;00:35:43,849;He taught himself.
519;00:35:45,101;00:35:46,519;Quite a man.
520;00:35:47,938;00:35:49,396;What killed him?
521;00:35:51,900;00:35:53,150;Loyalty.
522;00:35:55,403;00:35:57,238;You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?
523;00:36:01,076;00:36:02,117;Did...
524;00:36:04,412;00:36:06,872;Forgive me, my lord.
524;00:36:04,412;00:36:06,872;I shouldn't ask questions.
525;00:36:08,333;00:36:09,583;No.
526;00:36:10,794;00:36:12,586;But you've already begun.
527;00:36:14,631;00:36:16,632;Did you know your father, my lord?
528;00:36:18,260;00:36:19,426;I did.
529;00:36:21,221;00:36:23,055;I grew up with him.
530;00:36:25,141;00:36:27,434;I watched him grow old.
531;00:36:31,064;00:36:32,356;He loved us.
532;00:36:32,941;00:36:34,608;He was a good man,
533;00:36:36,111;00:36:37,736;but a weak man.
534;00:36:38,363;00:36:41,615;A weak man who nearly destroyed
534;00:36:38,363;00:36:41,615;our house and name.
535;00:36:44,286;00:36:45,536;I'm cold.
536;00:36:46,454;00:36:48,747;I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord.
537;00:36:48,874;00:36:49,874;Mmm.
538;00:37:17,819;00:37:19,194;Where are you going, girl?
539;00:37:20,113;00:37:22,031;The armory, my lord.
540;00:37:23,074;00:37:25,492;Why?
540;00:37:23,074;00:37:25,492;Lord Tywin sent me.
541;00:37:27,996;00:37:29,663;What might this be?
542;00:37:30,498;00:37:32,499;Lord Tywin gave it to me.
543;00:37:33,627;00:37:34,877;What for?
544;00:37:35,503;00:37:37,379;To take to the armory.
545;00:37:38,798;00:37:40,049;Why would he do that?
546;00:37:42,969;00:37:44,303;Let's go and ask him.
547;00:37:46,640;00:37:47,640;Move!
548;00:37:50,435;00:37:52,019;Get out of the way!
549;00:38:22,801;00:38:24,176;Amory Lorch.
550;00:38:25,095;00:38:26,971;A girl has named a second name.
551;00:38:27,055;00:38:28,305;A man will do what must be done.
552;00:38:28,390;00:38:29,431;Now!
553;00:38:30,725;00:38:33,560;A girl cannot tell a man
553;00:38:30,725;00:38:33,560;when exactly he must do a thing.
554;00:38:34,312;00:38:36,480;A man cannot make a thing
554;00:38:34,312;00:38:36,480;happen before its time.
555;00:38:36,564;00:38:38,232;But he's going to tell Tywin.
555;00:38:36,564;00:38:38,232;He's getting away.
556;00:38:38,316;00:38:39,900;It has to be now.
557;00:38:48,702;00:38:49,910;Guard!
558;00:39:00,088;00:39:02,381;Your Grace.
558;00:39:00,088;00:39:02,381;Your Grace.
559;00:39:07,095;00:39:08,846;My honor, Your Grace.
560;00:39:08,930;00:39:10,389;Your Grace.
561;00:39:16,646;00:39:18,397;Your Grace.
561;00:39:16,646;00:39:18,397;Quent.
562;00:39:40,336;00:39:41,837;Lady Talisa.
563;00:39:43,381;00:39:44,631;Your Grace.
564;00:39:46,134;00:39:47,760;I'm not sure I'm a lady.
565;00:39:47,844;00:39:50,304;Westerosi customs are
565;00:39:47,844;00:39:50,304;still a bit foreign to me.
566;00:39:50,388;00:39:52,264;It's hard to keep all the rules straight.
567;00:39:52,348;00:39:55,559;But if I remember my lessons,
568;00:39:55,643;00:39:58,437;a woman of noble birth
568;00:39:55,643;00:39:58,437;is always called a lady.
569;00:39:58,521;00:40:01,231;Unless she's a queen or a princess.
570;00:40:01,316;00:40:02,816;I could find someone who knows.
571;00:40:02,901;00:40:05,110;Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?
572;00:40:05,945;00:40:07,279;Because it's obvious.
573;00:40:08,656;00:40:11,283;What if I told you my father
573;00:40:08,656;00:40:11,283;sold lace on the Long Bridge,
574;00:40:11,367;00:40:13,827;and my mother, my brother and I
574;00:40:11,367;00:40:13,827;lived with him above our shop?
575;00:40:15,997;00:40:17,414;I'd call you a liar.
576;00:40:17,499;00:40:20,167;Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty.
577;00:40:24,964;00:40:26,340;I always thought I was a brilliant liar.
578;00:40:27,759;00:40:29,384;Better at amputations, I'm afraid.
579;00:40:35,391;00:40:37,184;Quite a pretty spot.
580;00:40:37,268;00:40:38,852;Will we be here long?
581;00:40:39,562;00:40:41,855;I couldn't really discuss
581;00:40:39,562;00:40:41,855;troop movements with you.
582;00:40:43,566;00:40:45,067;I'm not a spy.
583;00:40:45,151;00:40:47,319;Of course, a spy would deny being a spy.
584;00:40:49,030;00:40:51,740;You're right. You've found me out.
585;00:40:51,825;00:40:55,369;I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters.
585;00:40:51,825;00:40:55,369;The young wolf is on the move.
586;00:40:57,872;00:40:59,206;Perhaps you'd join me.
587;00:41:01,042;00:41:03,710;If you've got time, of course, for, well...
588;00:41:03,795;00:41:04,795;Robb.
589;00:41:07,465;00:41:08,632;Mother.
590;00:41:15,390;00:41:17,891;Mother, this is Lady Talisa.
591;00:41:18,685;00:41:20,269;She's been helping with the wounded.
592;00:41:20,353;00:41:22,980;She's been very helpful.
593;00:41:24,149;00:41:26,233;Lady Talisa.
593;00:41:24,149;00:41:26,233;Lady Stark.
594;00:41:27,193;00:41:28,694;Lady Talisa...
595;00:41:29,195;00:41:31,071;Maegyr.
595;00:41:29,195;00:41:31,071;Maegyr?
596;00:41:32,323;00:41:34,867;Forgive me, I do not know this name.
597;00:41:35,285;00:41:37,786;An uncommon name here.
597;00:41:35,285;00:41:37,786;An old name in Volantis.
598;00:41:39,038;00:41:41,331;Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace.
599;00:41:51,050;00:41:52,509;I've missed you.
600;00:41:52,969;00:41:55,971;Yes, you look positively forlorn.
601;00:41:56,347;00:41:58,098;You surprised me, that's all.
602;00:41:59,559;00:42:01,560;I didn't think I'd see you today.
603;00:42:02,353;00:42:04,521;I wish that you were free to follow your heart.
604;00:42:04,606;00:42:06,023;I know.
605;00:42:06,107;00:42:08,734;You have inherited
605;00:42:06,107;00:42:08,734;your father's responsibilities.
606;00:42:09,944;00:42:11,737;I'm afraid they come at a cost.
607;00:42:11,821;00:42:14,948;You are promised to another.
607;00:42:11,821;00:42:14,948;I know.
608;00:42:16,034;00:42:18,243;A debt that must be paid.
609;00:42:19,662;00:42:23,248;I haven't forgotten.
609;00:42:19,662;00:42:23,248;Your Grace. My lady.
610;00:42:23,625;00:42:25,375;News from Winterfell.
611;00:42:38,181;00:42:39,890;Your brothers desert you?
612;00:42:41,309;00:42:42,809;I can tell you which way to go.
613;00:42:44,479;00:42:46,063;We'll stop here.
614;00:42:46,147;00:42:47,981;Too dark to go any farther today.
615;00:42:48,066;00:42:50,609;Here? There's no shelter here.
616;00:42:50,693;00:42:52,069;There's no shelter anywhere.
617;00:42:52,153;00:42:54,738;There is...
617;00:42:52,153;00:42:54,738;if you know where to look.
618;00:42:58,451;00:43:00,202;The cold could kill us both.
619;00:43:00,286;00:43:02,496;If you light a fire...
619;00:43:00,286;00:43:02,496;No fire.
620;00:43:02,580;00:43:04,706;But a fire is...
620;00:43:02,580;00:43:04,706;No fire.
621;00:43:07,835;00:43:09,419;Have it your way.
622;00:43:17,053;00:43:19,513;We'll stay warmer if we stay close.
623;00:43:21,808;00:43:24,226;Bet you freeze to death before I do.
624;00:43:25,687;00:43:26,979;Bet your life.
625;00:43:52,922;00:43:54,881;Think they're out looking for you?
626;00:43:56,384;00:43:58,427;Yes.
626;00:43:56,384;00:43:58,427;Think they'll find you?
627;00:44:00,263;00:44:01,346;Yes.
628;00:44:04,017;00:44:05,559;You're brave.
629;00:44:07,270;00:44:08,395;Stupid,
630;00:44:09,147;00:44:10,355;but brave.
631;00:44:13,818;00:44:16,820;We start again at first light. Get some sleep.
632;00:44:33,004;00:44:34,504;Stop moving.
633;00:44:34,589;00:44:36,423;I'm just trying to get comfortable.
634;00:44:38,217;00:44:39,426;Stop it!
635;00:44:52,315;00:44:54,191;You're still moving.
635;00:44:52,315;00:44:54,191;Was I?
636;00:44:55,109;00:44:57,110;I didn't notice that time.
637;00:45:08,873;00:45:10,540;This cannot be true.
638;00:45:10,625;00:45:12,709;We've had ravens from White Harbor,
639;00:45:12,794;00:45:14,753;Barrowton and the Dreadfort.
640;00:45:14,837;00:45:16,129;I'm afraid it is true.
641;00:45:17,256;00:45:19,049;Why? Why would Theon...
642;00:45:19,133;00:45:21,510;Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.
643;00:45:22,303;00:45:25,055;My brothers?
643;00:45:22,303;00:45:25,055;We've heard nothing of them.
644;00:45:26,849;00:45:28,975;But Rodrik Cassel is dead.
645;00:45:30,895;00:45:32,979;I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!
646;00:45:36,484;00:45:38,235;I must go north at once.
647;00:45:38,319;00:45:40,028;There's still a war to win, Your Grace.
648;00:45:40,113;00:45:43,198;How can I call myself king
648;00:45:40,113;00:45:43,198;if I can't hold my own castle?
649;00:45:43,282;00:45:46,118;How can I ask men to follow me if I can't...
649;00:45:43,282;00:45:46,118;You are a king.
650;00:45:46,452;00:45:49,037;And that means you don't have
650;00:45:46,452;00:45:49,037;to do everything yourself.
651;00:45:49,372;00:45:50,872;Let me go and talk to Theon.
652;00:45:50,957;00:45:52,916;There will be no talk. He will die for this.
653;00:45:54,502;00:45:57,212;Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew.
654;00:45:57,296;00:45:59,881;Let me send word to
654;00:45:57,296;00:45:59,881;my bastard at the Dreadfort.
655;00:45:59,966;00:46:03,927;He can raise a few hundred men and retake
655;00:45:59,966;00:46:03,927;Winterfell before the new moon.
656;00:46:04,011;00:46:06,638;We have the Lannisters on the run.
657;00:46:07,306;00:46:10,934;If you march all the way back north now,
657;00:46:07,306;00:46:10,934;you'll lose what you gained.
658;00:46:11,686;00:46:15,230;My boy would be honored
658;00:46:11,686;00:46:15,230;to bring you Prince Theon's head.
659;00:46:16,524;00:46:19,818;Tell your son Bran and
659;00:46:16,524;00:46:19,818;Rickon's safety is paramount.
660;00:46:20,194;00:46:22,654;And Theon, I want him brought to me alive.
661;00:46:24,657;00:46:27,200;I want to look him in the eye and ask him why.
662;00:46:27,285;00:46:29,453;And then I'll take his head myself.
663;00:46:30,163;00:46:33,457;Why on earth would I trust the word
663;00:46:30,163;00:46:33,457;of a lying little savage like you?
664;00:46:33,541;00:46:35,000;I'm no liar.
665;00:46:36,711;00:46:40,672;All wildlings are liars and savages
665;00:46:36,711;00:46:40,672;with no loyalty to anything or anyone.
666;00:46:40,756;00:46:42,716;I done what I had to do to stay alive.
667;00:46:44,093;00:46:46,261;I hate the Starks as well as you do.
668;00:46:46,387;00:46:47,929;Let me serve you, my lord.
669;00:46:48,639;00:46:51,600;How? And don't tell me
669;00:46:48,639;00:46:51,600;to put a spear in your hand.
670;00:46:52,059;00:46:54,227;There are other ways to serve, my lord.
671;00:46:55,271;00:46:59,733;I'm a prince now, and you'd do well...
671;00:46:55,271;00:46:59,733;There are other ways to serve, my prince.
672;00:47:04,530;00:47:05,572;Like what?
673;00:47:08,534;00:47:10,952;We know things, the free people.
674;00:47:11,954;00:47:13,788;You know things?
675;00:47:15,041;00:47:16,082;Like what?
676;00:47:16,167;00:47:17,751;How to eat dirt?
677;00:47:19,879;00:47:21,171;Other things.
678;00:47:22,340;00:47:24,674;Savage things.
679;00:47:27,136;00:47:28,470;Wait outside.
680;00:47:46,030;00:47:47,781;I always wondered what you had under there.
681;00:47:49,408;00:47:50,992;It comes at a price.
682;00:47:51,452;00:47:53,119;I'm not killing you. That's your price.
683;00:47:53,204;00:47:54,663;I already had that.
684;00:47:56,749;00:47:58,166;What do you want then,
685;00:47:58,251;00:47:59,834;other than your miserable life?
686;00:48:00,962;00:48:02,462;What all free people want.
687;00:48:02,964;00:48:04,339;My freedom.
688;00:48:09,929;00:48:11,638;Well, you shall have it, then.
689;00:48:13,933;00:48:16,184;But only if you serve me well.
690;00:48:22,567;00:48:24,150;Ow!
690;00:48:22,567;00:48:24,150;Shh.
691;00:48:24,402;00:48:27,195;It's not deep.
691;00:48:24,402;00:48:27,195;I thought they were going to kill me.
692;00:48:27,613;00:48:29,406;They thought so, too.
693;00:48:29,490;00:48:31,575;He hated me, the man who hit me.
694;00:48:31,701;00:48:33,994;I saw it in his eyes. Hated me.
695;00:48:34,870;00:48:38,623;He never met me before,
695;00:48:34,870;00:48:38,623;but he wanted to hurt me.
696;00:48:39,208;00:48:42,085;Of course he did.
696;00:48:39,208;00:48:42,085;Why? Why would a stranger...
697;00:48:42,169;00:48:44,379;You are everything he will never have.
698;00:48:44,463;00:48:46,756;Your horse eats better than his children.
699;00:48:47,675;00:48:49,676;It doesn't matter now. He's dead.
700;00:48:50,344;00:48:52,512;I would have given them bread if I had it.
701;00:48:53,180;00:48:55,223;I hate the king more than any of them.
702;00:48:55,891;00:48:57,392;Don't say these things.
703;00:48:57,476;00:48:58,560;If the wrong people hear you...
704;00:48:58,644;00:49:00,645;But you're not the wrong people.
705;00:49:06,652;00:49:08,403;Don't trust anybody.
706;00:49:08,696;00:49:10,488;Life is safer that way.
707;00:49:51,989;00:49:53,698;And where are you going?
708;00:49:56,243;00:49:58,662;I have something for you from Prince Theon.
709;00:49:58,746;00:50:00,705;What?
709;00:49:58,746;00:50:00,705;Me.
710;00:50:04,251;00:50:06,294;He says I'm to make the rounds.
711;00:50:12,927;00:50:14,719;And keep you warm.
712;00:50:42,498;00:50:45,917;The Spice King refuses me
712;00:50:42,498;00:50:45,917;because I'm a bad investment.
713;00:50:46,043;00:50:49,379;The Silk King won't support me
713;00:50:46,043;00:50:49,379;because of his business with the Lannisters.
714;00:50:49,463;00:50:51,464;Why offend his best customer?
715;00:50:51,590;00:50:55,009;And the Copper King offers me a single ship
716;00:50:55,094;00:50:57,721;on the condition that I lie with him for a night.
717;00:50:57,805;00:51:00,682;Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?
718;00:51:01,559;00:51:04,477;When I came to this city, I had nothing.
719;00:51:05,104;00:51:06,813;Truly nothing.
720;00:51:07,648;00:51:09,399;I slept by the docks.
721;00:51:09,483;00:51:12,402;And when I could find work
721;00:51:09,483;00:51:12,402;loading the ships, I would eat.
722;00:51:12,486;00:51:14,529;If not, I dreamed of food.
723;00:51:15,156;00:51:17,782;Today, I am the richest man in Qarth.
724;00:51:18,617;00:51:23,037;Do you think the path from poverty to wealth
724;00:51:18,617;00:51:23,037;is always pure and honorable?
725;00:51:24,373;00:51:28,376;I have done many things, Khaleesi,
725;00:51:24,373;00:51:28,376;that a righteous man would condemn.
726;00:51:29,670;00:51:32,756;And here I am, with no regrets.
727;00:51:45,895;00:51:48,855;Bar the gates. Ring the bells.
728;00:51:49,982;00:51:51,274;Slowly, Khaleesi.
729;00:52:01,702;00:52:03,036;Where are they?
730;00:52:10,461;00:52:12,253;Where are my dragons?
