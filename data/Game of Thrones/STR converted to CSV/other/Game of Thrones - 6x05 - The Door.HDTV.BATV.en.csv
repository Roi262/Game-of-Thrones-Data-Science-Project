3;00:01:56,571;00:01:57,613;Yes?
4;00:02:00,842;00:02:02,759;For you, my lady.
5;00:02:22,292;00:02:24,224;How far is Mole's Town?
6;00:02:32,355;00:02:33,416;Sansa.
7;00:02:37,882;00:02:39,185;Lady Brienne.
8;00:02:42,749;00:02:46,372;When I heard you had escaped
8;00:02:42,749;00:02:46,372;Winterfell, I feared the worst.
9;00:02:47,294;00:02:49,453;You have no idea how happy I am
10;00:02:49,799;00:02:51,415;to see you unharmed.
11;00:02:52,404;00:02:53,446;Unharmed?
12;00:02:55,264;00:02:56,619;What are you doing here?
13;00:02:56,816;00:02:59,728;I rode north with the Knights
13;00:02:56,816;00:02:59,728;of the Vale to come to your aid.
14;00:02:59,991;00:03:02,307;They're encamped at
14;00:02:59,991;00:03:02,307;Moat Cailin as we speak.
15;00:03:02,318;00:03:03,935;To come to my aid?
16;00:03:06,063;00:03:07,671;Did you know about Ramsay?
17;00:03:09,389;00:03:13,019;If you didn't know, you're an idiot.
17;00:03:09,389;00:03:13,019;If you did know, you're my enemy.
18;00:03:14,065;00:03:17,061;Would you like to hear
18;00:03:14,065;00:03:17,061;about our wedding night?
19;00:03:19,089;00:03:21,085;He never hurt my face.
20;00:03:21,771;00:03:24,732;He needed my face,
20;00:03:21,771;00:03:24,732;the face of Ned Stark's daughter.
21;00:03:29,433;00:03:31,191;But the rest of me,
22;00:03:32,386;00:03:37,832;he did what he liked with the rest of me
22;00:03:32,386;00:03:37,832;as long as I could still give him an heir.
23;00:03:40,567;00:03:42,477;What do you think he did?
24;00:03:46,676;00:03:50,189;I can't begin to contemplate...
24;00:03:46,676;00:03:50,189;What do you think he did to me?
25;00:03:58,719;00:04:01,094;Lady Sansa asked you a question.
26;00:04:02,477;00:04:03,519;He beat you.
27;00:04:03,530;00:04:06,177;Yes, he enjoyed that.
27;00:04:03,530;00:04:06,177;What else do you think he did?
28;00:04:06,359;00:04:08,473;Sansa, I...
28;00:04:06,359;00:04:08,473;What else?
29;00:04:11,568;00:04:13,124;Did he cut you?
30;00:04:14,883;00:04:17,702;Maybe you did know about
30;00:04:14,883;00:04:17,702;Ramsay all along. - I didn't know.
31;00:04:17,810;00:04:19,655;I thought you knew everyone's secrets.
32;00:04:19,823;00:04:21,146;I made a mistake,
33;00:04:22,116;00:04:25,482;a horrible mistake.
33;00:04:22,116;00:04:25,482;I underestimated a stranger.
34;00:04:26,784;00:04:29,709;The other things he did, ladies
34;00:04:26,784;00:04:29,709;aren't supposed to talk about those things,
35;00:04:29,720;00:04:33,083;but I imagine brothel keepers
35;00:04:29,720;00:04:33,083;talk about them all the time.
36;00:04:35,151;00:04:36,707;I can still feel it.
37;00:04:38,087;00:04:40,797;I don't mean in my tender
37;00:04:38,087;00:04:40,797;heart it still pains me so.
38;00:04:40,808;00:04:44,974;I can still feel what he did in
38;00:04:40,808;00:04:44,974;my body standing here right now.
39;00:04:47,137;00:04:50,300;I'm so sorry.
40;00:04:50,445;00:04:52,317;You said you would protect me.
41;00:04:52,328;00:04:53,370;And I will.
42;00:04:54,060;00:04:57,363;You must believe me when I tell you that I will.
42;00:04:54,060;00:04:57,363;I don't believe you anymore.
43;00:04:57,998;00:05:01,054;I don't need you anymore.
43;00:04:57,998;00:05:01,054;You can't protect me.
44;00:05:01,531;00:05:05,389;You won't even be able to protect
44;00:05:01,531;00:05:05,389;yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down.
45;00:05:08,221;00:05:09,938;And why shouldn't I?
46;00:05:12,963;00:05:15,264;Do you want me to beg for my life?
47;00:05:15,274;00:05:17,203;If that's what you want, I will.
48;00:05:19,530;00:05:21,818;Whatever you ask that is in my power,
49;00:05:21,829;00:05:23,172;I will do.
50;00:05:24,658;00:05:27,646;What if I want you to die here and now?
51;00:05:28,976;00:05:30,740;Then I will die.
52;00:05:32,570;00:05:36,196;You freed me from the monsters
52;00:05:32,570;00:05:36,196;who murdered my family
53;00:05:36,645;00:05:40,621;and you gave me to other
53;00:05:36,645;00:05:40,621;monsters who murdered my family.
54;00:05:42,041;00:05:43,813;Go back to Moat Cailin.
55;00:05:44,403;00:05:48,634;My brother and I will take back the North
55;00:05:44,403;00:05:48,634;on our own. I never want to see you again.
56;00:05:48,733;00:05:52,250;I would do anything to
56;00:05:48,733;00:05:52,250;undo what's been done to you.
57;00:05:54,294;00:05:56,051;I know that I can't.
58;00:05:58,237;00:06:01,030;Will you allow me to say
58;00:05:58,237;00:06:01,030;one more thing before I go?
59;00:06:04,103;00:06:07,047;Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish
60;00:06:07,493;00:06:11,034;has gathered what remains of
60;00:06:07,493;00:06:11,034;the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun.
61;00:06:11,045;00:06:13,222;You might consider seeking him out.
62;00:06:13,765;00:06:16,451;The time may come when
62;00:06:13,765;00:06:16,451;you need an army loyal to you.
63;00:06:16,462;00:06:19,619;I have an army.
63;00:06:16,462;00:06:19,619;Your brother's army.
64;00:06:28,106;00:06:29,767;Half-brother.
65;00:06:59,169;00:07:00,651;You're not ready.
66;00:07:02,870;00:07:05,793;You should go home before it's too late.
67;00:08:02,135;00:08:05,115;You'll never be one of us, Lady Stark.
68;00:08:20,624;00:08:22,293;She has a point.
69;00:08:28,321;00:08:31,806;None of the first Faceless Men
69;00:08:28,321;00:08:31,806;were born to lords and ladies.
70;00:08:31,817;00:08:34,706;They began as slaves
70;00:08:31,817;00:08:34,706;in the mines of Valyria.
71;00:08:35,096;00:08:37,781;Who was the first?
71;00:08:35,096;00:08:37,781;He was no one.
72;00:08:39,224;00:08:43,806;The Many-Faced God taught him how
72;00:08:39,224;00:08:43,806;to shed his face and how to give the gift.
73;00:08:43,946;00:08:47,179;The man taught others in
73;00:08:43,946;00:08:47,179;exchange for their service.
74;00:08:47,465;00:08:51,029;Many served,
74;00:08:47,465;00:08:51,029;many more gifts were given.
75;00:08:51,302;00:08:53,830;Soon all the masters
75;00:08:51,302;00:08:53,830;and overseers were gone
76;00:08:54,101;00:08:56,124;and the Faceless Men fled.
77;00:08:56,468;00:08:58,077;Where did they go?
78;00:08:59,194;00:09:00,302;Here.
79;00:09:00,313;00:09:03,666;They founded the Free City
79;00:09:00,313;00:09:03,666;of Braavos and built this house.
80;00:09:05,004;00:09:07,592;These were the faces they wore in life
81;00:09:07,796;00:09:10,054;when they were not wearing others.
82;00:09:10,331;00:09:12,664;The first Faceless Men.
83;00:09:14,627;00:09:18,623;And now a girl is one of them,
83;00:09:14,627;00:09:18,623;if a girl desires.
84;00:09:20,319;00:09:22,691;A girl has no desires.
85;00:09:30,325;00:09:31,468;Who?
86;00:09:39,014;00:09:41,782;An actress who calls herself Lady Crane.
87;00:09:42,061;00:09:44,696;She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square.
88;00:09:46,128;00:09:48,848;A girl has been given a second chance.
89;00:09:49,658;00:09:51,741;There will not be a third.
90;00:09:52,131;00:09:56,719;One way or another,
90;00:09:52,131;00:09:56,719;a face will be added to the hall.
91;00:10:21,053;00:10:25,818;Oh, murdered by a boar.
91;00:10:21,053;00:10:25,818;The great big hairy whore.
92;00:10:26,276;00:10:29,552;He dug in his tusks
92;00:10:26,276;00:10:29,552;and dug out my guts
93;00:10:29,562;00:10:33,110;and soon I am no more.
94;00:10:33,381;00:10:36,105;Oh, come, Father,
94;00:10:33,381;00:10:36,105;in bed you must lie.
95;00:10:36,522;00:10:39,425;I love you, Father.
95;00:10:36,522;00:10:39,425;Please don't die.
96;00:10:39,436;00:10:42,939;Shut up, you swine!
96;00:10:39,436;00:10:42,939;Cersei, more wine.
97;00:10:44,201;00:10:47,499;I feel the winds of winter
97;00:10:44,201;00:10:47,499;as they lick across the land.
98;00:10:47,530;00:10:52,499;And our son alone on that cold,
98;00:10:47,530;00:10:52,499;cold throne without a guiding hand.
99;00:10:52,752;00:10:56,456;Who will teach him strength?
99;00:10:52,752;00:10:56,456;Who will teach him grace?
100;00:10:56,466;00:11:00,107;To whom will he turn when it's time to
100;00:10:56,466;00:11:00,107;learn to look darkness in the face?
101;00:11:00,139;00:11:03,898;Ned Stark will do fine.
101;00:11:00,139;00:11:03,898;Now bring me more wine.
102;00:11:08,671;00:11:10,572;Ooh, what's happened here, then?
103;00:11:10,603;00:11:15,065;He brought you here, Ned Stark,
103;00:11:10,603;00:11:15,065;'cause you're the brightest fellow in the land.
104;00:11:15,214;00:11:19,038;You should be king of us all
104;00:11:15,214;00:11:19,038;and I should be your Hand.
105;00:11:19,136;00:11:23,283;We men of the North are right
105;00:11:19,136;00:11:23,283;good hands at keeping people lawful.
106;00:11:23,590;00:11:27,222;I'd ask him for permission,
106;00:11:23,590;00:11:27,222;but he smells too bloody awful.
107;00:11:29,415;00:11:30,550;I die!
108;00:11:30,920;00:11:35,491;I die! And here I now must lie.
109;00:11:37,039;00:11:39,241;Oh, woe. Oh, no.
110;00:11:41,898;00:11:46,224;Oh, I am about to go.
111;00:11:47,526;00:11:51,355;Will you stay on as Joffrey's Hand?
111;00:11:47,526;00:11:51,355;The Iron Throne's what I demand.
112;00:11:51,365;00:11:52,549;You cannot.
112;00:11:51,365;00:11:52,549;I can.
113;00:11:52,560;00:11:53,652;You will not.
113;00:11:52,560;00:11:53,652;I will.
114;00:11:53,662;00:11:55,277;You dare not.
114;00:11:53,662;00:11:55,277;I dare yes.
115;00:11:55,288;00:11:57,478;The line of succession.
115;00:11:55,288;00:11:57,478;What's that mean?
116;00:11:57,489;00:11:59,324;The proper progression.
116;00:11:57,489;00:11:59,324;What's that mean?
117;00:11:59,334;00:12:02,426;The lawful ascension.
117;00:11:59,334;00:12:02,426;What's that mean?
118;00:12:14,177;00:12:19,225;So move along, give me my chair
118;00:12:14,177;00:12:19,225;and there won't be no more trouble.
119;00:12:22,863;00:12:25,824;But we had a deal all done and dusted.
120;00:12:25,835;00:12:28,713;I'm starting to think you can't be trusted.
121;00:12:39,240;00:12:42,285;Save my father.
121;00:12:39,240;00:12:42,285;Truly you should.
122;00:12:42,695;00:12:44,464;Killing the man will do you no good.
123;00:12:44,495;00:12:47,128;Save him, please.
123;00:12:44,495;00:12:47,128;Show him mercy.
124;00:12:47,159;00:12:49,505;Show the people what
124;00:12:47,159;00:12:49,505;a good king should be.
125;00:12:49,614;00:12:51,840;Good people, you may all relax.
126;00:12:51,871;00:12:54,440;My father's friend shall be spared the...
127;00:12:56,250;00:12:59,418;Father! No!
128;00:13:00,506;00:13:01,754;Oh, Father. Oh!
129;00:13:11,753;00:13:14,380;Worry not!
129;00:13:11,753;00:13:14,380;All is well.
130;00:13:14,748;00:13:19,233;I have here a decree
130;00:13:14,748;00:13:19,233;from my father Tywin Lannister,
131;00:13:19,639;00:13:21,568;the richest man you'll see.
132;00:13:21,925;00:13:24,132;He proclaims me Hand of the King.
133;00:13:24,607;00:13:26,319;The position's mine for life.
134;00:13:26,528;00:13:31,321;And he's given me permission
134;00:13:26,528;00:13:31,321;to take Sansa as my wife.
135;00:13:33,839;00:13:38,140;You'll learn that what I lack in height,
135;00:13:33,839;00:13:38,140;I make up for in appetite.
136;00:13:38,249;00:13:43,162;So let's forget about your plight,
136;00:13:38,249;00:13:43,162;and go rehearse our wedding night.
137;00:13:52,899;00:13:56,801;It's a wart. Two warts.
137;00:13:52,899;00:13:56,801;I've got two fucking warts on my cock.
138;00:13:56,936;00:14:00,778;Well, don't worry, love.
138;00:13:56,936;00:14:00,778;They usually go away in five or six years.
139;00:14:01,914;00:14:04,175;Oh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me.
140;00:14:04,206;00:14:06,484;You can do better, Bianca, dear.
141;00:14:06,516;00:14:07,558;You must do.
142;00:14:07,847;00:14:09,294;I had two lines.
143;00:14:09,305;00:14:11,967;There are no small parts.
143;00:14:09,305;00:14:11,967;You rang very false.
144;00:14:12,075;00:14:13,516;I rang very false?
145;00:14:13,548;00:14:16,654;What you need, love,
145;00:14:13,548;00:14:16,654;is for someone to ring you true.
146;00:14:20,370;00:14:22,704;You weren't complaining about me last night.
146;00:14:20,370;00:14:22,704;May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?
147;00:14:22,714;00:14:24,907;I'm a rum girl, Bobono.
148;00:14:25,335;00:14:28,903;You need to know that if we're going to be
148;00:14:25,335;00:14:28,903;intimate. - Of course we're going to be intimate.
149;00:14:28,934;00:14:31,064;It's only a matter of time.
150;00:14:35,333;00:14:38,509;To our children.
150;00:14:35,333;00:14:38,509;May they have your talent.
151;00:14:38,549;00:14:40,235;And your filthy mind.
152;00:14:47,316;00:14:49,359;A girl will poison the rum.
153;00:14:49,882;00:14:51,967;Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.
154;00:14:56,224;00:14:59,408;If a girl could use one
154;00:14:56,224;00:14:59,408;of the faces from the hall...
155;00:14:59,605;00:15:01,243;A girl is not ready.
156;00:15:04,469;00:15:06,128;She's a good actress.
157;00:15:06,444;00:15:08,270;So a man has heard.
158;00:15:09,815;00:15:11,539;Seems like a decent woman.
159;00:15:14,908;00:15:18,738;Does death only come for
159;00:15:14,908;00:15:18,738;the wicked and leave the decent behind?
160;00:15:20,602;00:15:21,645;No.
161;00:15:25,895;00:15:27,288;Who wants her dead?
162;00:15:27,298;00:15:30,272;That does not matter.
162;00:15:27,298;00:15:30,272;The price was paid.
163;00:15:32,203;00:15:33,976;The younger actress.
164;00:15:35,016;00:15:37,724;She's jealous because Lady Crane is better.
165;00:15:38,591;00:15:42,066;A girl must decide if she wants
165;00:15:38,591;00:15:42,066;to serve the Many-Faced God.
166;00:15:43,548;00:15:45,197;A girl has decided.
167;00:15:46,160;00:15:48,750;A servant does not ask questions.
168;00:16:58,025;00:17:00,425;No! No! No!
169;00:17:24,107;00:17:25,503;It was you.
170;00:17:26,380;00:17:28,261;You made the white walkers.
171;00:17:28,464;00:17:30,126;We were at war.
172;00:17:30,770;00:17:32,585;We were being slaughtered.
173;00:17:32,732;00:17:34,777;Our sacred trees cut down.
174;00:17:35,660;00:17:37,496;We needed to defend ourselves.
175;00:17:38,108;00:17:39,645;From whom?
176;00:17:40,277;00:17:41,620;From you.
177;00:17:42,917;00:17:44,316;From men.
178;00:17:53,314;00:17:56,167;We speak in the presence of the Drowned God.
179;00:17:57,109;00:18:01,752;In his name we gather today
179;00:17:57,109;00:18:01,752;to choose a new king as our leader.
180;00:18:02,604;00:18:04,520;Who makes a claim?
181;00:18:09,766;00:18:11,858;I am Yara Greyjoy,
182;00:18:12,074;00:18:16,120;daughter of Balon Greyjoy,
182;00:18:12,074;00:18:16,120;King of the Iron Islands.
183;00:18:18,128;00:18:21,308;I claim the Salt Throne.
183;00:18:18,128;00:18:21,308;We've never had a queen.
184;00:18:21,642;00:18:24,518;Not once.
184;00:18:21,642;00:18:24,518;There are many things we've never done.
185;00:18:25,542;00:18:28,106;We've never made
185;00:18:25,542;00:18:28,106;our mark upon the world.
186;00:18:28,305;00:18:31,846;The great lords
186;00:18:28,305;00:18:31,846;of Westeros pay us no mind
187;00:18:31,878;00:18:36,538;until our little raids buzz through their
187;00:18:31,878;00:18:36,538;kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance.
188;00:18:36,570;00:18:38,290;Then they swat us down.
189;00:18:38,638;00:18:41,753;They conquer us, humiliate us,
190;00:18:42,434;00:18:44,917;and go right back to forgetting we exist.
191;00:18:44,948;00:18:46,200;Aye!
192;00:18:47,035;00:18:49,381;- We are a sea people.
192;00:18:47,035;00:18:49,381;Aye!
193;00:18:49,431;00:18:52,142;- Our god is a sea god.
193;00:18:49,431;00:18:52,142;Aye!
194;00:18:52,288;00:18:54,615;When I am queen,
194;00:18:52,288;00:18:54,615;we will build a fleet that...
195;00:18:54,646;00:18:56,382;You shall not be queen!
195;00:18:54,646;00:18:56,382;I am not finished!
196;00:18:56,431;00:18:59,649;Yes, you are!
196;00:18:56,431;00:18:59,649;A woman will not lead us.
197;00:18:59,659;00:19:02,862;Not when Balon's own
197;00:18:59,659;00:19:02,862;male heir has returned.
198;00:19:30,066;00:19:31,880;I am Theon Greyjoy...
199;00:19:33,569;00:19:36,316;last living son of Balon Greyjoy.
200;00:19:44,100;00:19:46,446;And she is your rightful ruler.
201;00:19:46,686;00:19:47,728;Aye!
202;00:19:48,327;00:19:52,007;Those of you that have sailed under her,
202;00:19:48,327;00:19:52,007;and there are many of you here,
203;00:19:52,440;00:19:54,308;- you know what she is.
203;00:19:52,440;00:19:54,308;Aye!
204;00:19:54,829;00:19:56,332;- She is a reaver.
204;00:19:54,829;00:19:56,332;Aye!
205;00:19:56,611;00:19:58,152;- She is a warrior.
205;00:19:56,611;00:19:58,152;Aye!
206;00:19:58,407;00:20:00,590;- She is ironborn!
206;00:19:58,407;00:20:00,590;Aye!
207;00:20:01,526;00:20:04,073;We will find no better leader.
208;00:20:07,873;00:20:09,894;This is our queen.
209;00:20:15,920;00:20:18,249;Yara! Yara! Yara!
210;00:20:18,352;00:20:20,402;I'm Euron Greyjoy.
211;00:20:21,565;00:20:23,690;I claim the Salt Throne.
212;00:20:35,193;00:20:36,488;Niece.
213;00:20:38,206;00:20:39,501;Nephew.
214;00:20:41,063;00:20:42,671;Little Theon.
215;00:20:44,514;00:20:47,889;Heard you managed to fuck
215;00:20:44,514;00:20:47,889;things right into the ground.
216;00:20:48,812;00:20:51,095;Captured a castle you couldn't keep.
217;00:20:51,222;00:20:53,492;Got yourself taken prisoner.
218;00:20:54,755;00:20:57,328;Even heard you have no cock.
219;00:21:00,275;00:21:02,792;Explains why you think
219;00:21:00,275;00:21:02,792;a woman can be king.
220;00:21:02,802;00:21:05,533;When did you return, Uncle?
220;00:21:02,802;00:21:05,533;A few days ago.
221;00:21:06,997;00:21:09,132;I had some things to take care of.
222;00:21:09,393;00:21:11,023;Long overdue.
223;00:21:12,407;00:21:14,484;I'm glad you're here.
224;00:21:15,972;00:21:19,392;Now I know what my
224;00:21:15,972;00:21:19,392;first act as queen will be.
225;00:21:19,903;00:21:23,018;To execute the man who killed my father.
226;00:21:29,457;00:21:30,849;I did.
227;00:21:31,266;00:21:32,737;I killed him.
228;00:21:34,483;00:21:38,257;Threw him right over
228;00:21:34,483;00:21:38,257;a rope bridge and watched him fall.
229;00:21:40,107;00:21:42,071;He was leading us nowhere
230;00:21:42,316;00:21:45,003;and we would still be heading
230;00:21:42,316;00:21:45,003;there if it weren't for me.
231;00:21:45,013;00:21:46,439;No one loved him.
232;00:21:46,622;00:21:50,631;No one wanted to follow him.
232;00:21:46,622;00:21:50,631;He led us into two wars we couldn't win.
233;00:21:51,030;00:21:54,784;I apologize to you all for
233;00:21:51,030;00:21:54,784;not killing him years ago.
234;00:21:54,864;00:21:56,857;That would have been hard to do.
235;00:21:57,143;00:21:58,583;You weren't here.
236;00:21:59,168;00:22:02,746;Last I heard, you were gallivanting
236;00:21:59,168;00:22:02,746;around the world having a grand old time.
237;00:22:02,777;00:22:04,081;Gallivanting?
238;00:22:04,708;00:22:08,277;That the sort of thing you start
238;00:22:04,708;00:22:08,277;to say once your dick gets chopped off?
239;00:22:08,775;00:22:11,959;Did the great lords of Westeros
239;00:22:08,775;00:22:11,959;teach you words like that?
240;00:22:12,716;00:22:14,219;You were gone.
241;00:22:14,662;00:22:18,959;Yara was here.
241;00:22:14,662;00:22:18,959;Being ironborn. Leading ironborn.
242;00:22:19,088;00:22:21,404;Getting ready to bring us back to glory.
243;00:22:22,492;00:22:24,161;And how will she do that?
244;00:22:24,845;00:22:28,420;I will build the largest fleet
244;00:22:24,845;00:22:28,420;the world has ever seen.
245;00:22:30,477;00:22:34,715;Right idea, except I'm the one
245;00:22:30,477;00:22:34,715;who's going to build the Iron Fleet
246;00:22:34,944;00:22:37,218;because I'm the one
246;00:22:34,944;00:22:37,218;who knows how to use it.
247;00:22:37,250;00:22:41,595;I've been all over the world.
247;00:22:37,250;00:22:41,595;I've seen more of it than all of you combined.
248;00:22:42,404;00:22:48,938;And across the sea there is a person who hates
248;00:22:42,404;00:22:48,938;the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do.
249;00:22:49,686;00:22:55,366;Someone with a large army,
249;00:22:49,686;00:22:55,366;three large dragons, and no husband.
250;00:22:55,964;00:22:57,710;I'm going to build that fleet
251;00:22:58,019;00:23:00,273;and I'm going to gallivant right over
252;00:23:00,488;00:23:04,545;and give it to Daenerys Targaryen
252;00:23:00,488;00:23:04,545;along with my big cock.
253;00:23:05,169;00:23:07,063;You're going to
253;00:23:05,169;00:23:07,063;seduce the Dragon Queen?
254;00:23:07,073;00:23:10,238;I'm not going to seduce her.
254;00:23:07,073;00:23:10,238;The Iron Fleet will seduce her.
255;00:23:10,528;00:23:13,350;And together we're going
255;00:23:10,528;00:23:13,350;to take the Seven Kingdoms.
256;00:23:14,432;00:23:16,449;I wasn't born to be king.
257;00:23:16,933;00:23:20,992;I paid the iron price and here I stand.
258;00:23:23,414;00:23:26,357;Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!
259;00:23:26,489;00:23:29,204;Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!
260;00:23:29,335;00:23:32,114;Euron! Euron! Euron!
261;00:23:44,189;00:23:48,647;May Euron, your servant,
261;00:23:44,189;00:23:48,647;be born again from the sea as you were.
262;00:23:49,127;00:23:50,786;Bless him with salt.
263;00:23:50,999;00:23:52,579;Bless him with stone.
264;00:23:52,740;00:23:54,537;Bless him with steel.
265;00:23:54,569;00:23:57,387;Listen to the waves. Listen to the god.
266;00:23:57,717;00:24:00,259;He is speaking to us and he says
267;00:24:00,890;00:24:04,597;we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy.
268;00:24:05,650;00:24:08,965;Let the sea wash your follies
268;00:24:05,650;00:24:08,965;and your vanities away.
269;00:24:09,248;00:24:10,958;Let the old Euron drown.
270;00:24:11,274;00:24:14,014;Let his lungs fill with seawater.
271;00:24:19,998;00:24:23,274;Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.
272;00:24:23,285;00:24:28,987;What is dead may never die,
272;00:24:23,285;00:24:28,987;but rises again harder and stronger.
273;00:25:36,417;00:25:39,082;What is dead may never die.
274;00:25:39,280;00:25:41,727;What is dead may never die.
275;00:25:56,332;00:25:58,533;Where are my niece and nephew?
276;00:26:03,713;00:26:05,612;Let's go murder them.
277;00:26:25,839;00:26:27,753;They stole our best ships.
278;00:26:29,529;00:26:31,643;Won't be enough to save them.
279;00:26:33,160;00:26:34,919;Go back to your homes.
280;00:26:35,351;00:26:40,388;Chop down every tree you can find.
280;00:26:35,351;00:26:40,388;Quarter-saw the timber and start building.
281;00:26:40,562;00:26:42,694;I want every man bending planks.
282;00:26:42,743;00:26:45,508;I want every woman spinning flax for sails.
283;00:26:46,348;00:26:50,745;Build me a thousand ships
283;00:26:46,348;00:26:50,745;and I will give you this world.
284;00:27:10,542;00:27:13,395;I banished you twice.
285;00:27:14,186;00:27:17,445;You came back twice.
286;00:27:20,729;00:27:22,466;And you saved my life.
287;00:27:27,121;00:27:31,747;So I can't take you back
287;00:27:27,121;00:27:31,747;and I can't send you away.
288;00:27:33,870;00:27:35,862;You must send me away.
289;00:27:49,216;00:27:51,021;Is there a cure?
290;00:27:51,515;00:27:52,857;I don't know.
291;00:27:54,435;00:27:56,285;How long does it take?
292;00:27:56,941;00:27:58,700;I don't know that either.
293;00:27:58,829;00:28:01,321;But I've seen what happens
293;00:27:58,829;00:28:01,321;when it goes far enough.
294;00:28:02,650;00:28:04,784;I'll end things before that.
295;00:28:08,271;00:28:10,038;I'm sorry.
296;00:28:11,389;00:28:13,533;I'm so sorry.
296;00:28:11,389;00:28:13,533;Don't be.
297;00:28:14,646;00:28:17,041;All I've ever wanted was to serve you.
298;00:28:20,555;00:28:23,021;Tyrion Lannister was right.
299;00:28:25,797;00:28:27,140;I love you.
300;00:28:32,942;00:28:34,627;I'll always love you.
301;00:28:39,435;00:28:41,278;Good-bye, khaleesi.
302;00:28:46,899;00:28:50,419;Do not walk away from your queen,
302;00:28:46,899;00:28:50,419;Jorah the Andal.
303;00:28:53,301;00:28:55,441;You have not been dismissed.
304;00:28:57,218;00:28:59,147;You pledged yourself to me.
305;00:28:59,844;00:29:03,069;You swore to obey my commands
305;00:28:59,844;00:29:03,069;for the rest of your life.
306;00:29:04,771;00:29:07,157;Well, I command you to find the cure
307;00:29:08,645;00:29:11,079;wherever it is in this world.
308;00:29:13,551;00:29:15,848;I command you to heal yourself
309;00:29:17,362;00:29:19,108;and then return to me.
310;00:29:22,150;00:29:24,459;When I take the Seven Kingdoms,
311;00:29:25,385;00:29:27,443;I need you by my side.
312;00:30:06,493;00:30:10,124;In the last fortnight since
312;00:30:06,493;00:30:10,124;our pact with the Masters,
313;00:30:10,134;00:30:13,341;how many killings have been
313;00:30:10,134;00:30:13,341;carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?
314;00:30:13,711;00:30:14,754;None.
315;00:30:14,850;00:30:17,779;And how many Masters have
315;00:30:14,850;00:30:17,779;been butchered by the free men?
316;00:30:18,054;00:30:21,831;Two, but that was the day of the pact.
316;00:30:18,054;00:30:21,831;Since then, nothing.
317;00:30:22,190;00:30:25,527;So it's safe to say that a
317;00:30:22,190;00:30:25,527;fragile peace has taken hold.
318;00:30:25,628;00:30:26,771;For now.
319;00:30:26,832;00:30:28,929;For now is the best
319;00:30:26,832;00:30:28,929;we get in our profession.
320;00:30:28,940;00:30:30,206;It's not enough.
321;00:30:30,216;00:30:34,057;Considering the city was on the
321;00:30:30,216;00:30:34,057;brink of civil war, I'd say it's a good start.
322;00:30:34,234;00:30:36,591;It's not enough for
322;00:30:34,234;00:30:36,591;Meereen to have peace.
323;00:30:37,010;00:30:39,479;They need to know
323;00:30:37,010;00:30:39,479;Daenerys is responsible for it.
324;00:30:39,828;00:30:42,157;The Sons of the Harpy have a good story.
325;00:30:42,168;00:30:46,707;Resist the foreign invaders.
325;00:30:42,168;00:30:46,707;Our queen has an even better story.
326;00:30:46,800;00:30:51,781;Mother of Dragons,
326;00:30:46,800;00:30:51,781;Breaker of Chains and all that.
327;00:30:51,980;00:30:54,065;The people know
327;00:30:51,980;00:30:54,065;who brought them freedom.
328;00:30:54,075;00:30:56,643;Yes, but do they know
328;00:30:54,075;00:30:56,643;who brought them security?
329;00:30:56,654;00:30:58,652;Who brought about
329;00:30:56,654;00:30:58,652;an end to the violence?
330;00:30:58,927;00:31:01,478;We need someone the people trust,
331;00:31:01,605;00:31:04,814;someone they know
331;00:31:01,605;00:31:04,814;cannot be bought or influenced.
332;00:31:04,984;00:31:07,740;Sounds like quite the hero.
332;00:31:04,984;00:31:07,740;Where would we find him?
333;00:31:08,013;00:31:10,263;Who said anything about him?
334;00:31:12,137;00:31:14,604;_
335;00:31:15,453;00:31:18,413;_
336;00:31:18,867;00:31:20,189;_
337;00:31:20,239;00:31:21,590;_
338;00:31:21,926;00:31:25,439;_
339;00:31:31,727;00:31:35,150;_
340;00:31:37,038;00:31:39,788;That's about the extent of my Valyrian.
341;00:31:46,069;00:31:48,418;Thank you for travelling all this way.
342;00:31:48,837;00:31:52,801;I know from personal experience
342;00:31:48,837;00:31:52,801;how uncomfortable the journey can be.
343;00:31:57,653;00:32:00,621;The truth is we need your help.
344;00:32:00,799;00:32:03,602;We had hoped that we could
344;00:32:00,799;00:32:03,602;somehow persuade you to...
345;00:32:03,612;00:32:05,373;You don't need to persuade me.
346;00:32:05,849;00:32:07,709;I came to help.
347;00:32:07,936;00:32:10,803;Daenerys Stormborn is
347;00:32:07,936;00:32:10,803;the one who was promised.
348;00:32:11,356;00:32:14,174;From the fire she was
348;00:32:11,356;00:32:14,174;reborn to remake the world.
349;00:32:15,472;00:32:16,515;Yes.
350;00:32:17,278;00:32:22,000;She has freed the slaves from their
350;00:32:17,278;00:32:22,000;chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.
351;00:32:22,965;00:32:24,529;She did indeed.
352;00:32:24,626;00:32:26,874;Her dragons are fire made flesh,
353;00:32:27,741;00:32:29,721;a gift from the Lord of Light.
354;00:32:29,951;00:32:35,087;But you heard all of this before,
354;00:32:29,951;00:32:35,087;haven't you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis.
355;00:32:37,267;00:32:40,559;The dragons will purify
355;00:32:37,267;00:32:40,559;nonbelievers by the thousands,
356;00:32:40,849;00:32:43,330;burning their sins and flesh away.
357;00:32:43,931;00:32:47,648;Ideally we'd avoid purifying
357;00:32:43,931;00:32:47,648;too many nonbelievers.
358;00:32:48,362;00:32:51,038;The Mother of Dragons has
358;00:32:48,362;00:32:51,038;followers of many different faiths.
359;00:32:51,319;00:32:54,588;You want your queen
359;00:32:51,319;00:32:54,588;to be worshipped and obeyed.
360;00:32:54,715;00:32:59,069;And while she's gone, you want her
360;00:32:54,715;00:32:59,069;advisors to be worshipped and obeyed.
361;00:33:00,139;00:33:02,262;I'd settle for obeyed.
362;00:33:02,509;00:33:05,061;I will summon my most eloquent priests.
363;00:33:05,675;00:33:07,691;They will spread the word.
364;00:33:08,394;00:33:11,863;Daenerys has been sent to lead
364;00:33:08,394;00:33:11,863;the people against the darkness
365;00:33:11,894;00:33:16,111;in this war and in the
365;00:33:11,894;00:33:16,111;great war still to come.
366;00:33:16,282;00:33:19,516;That sounds most excellent.
366;00:33:16,282;00:33:19,516;A man named Stannis Baratheon
367;00:33:19,548;00:33:23,577;was anointed as the chosen
367;00:33:19,548;00:33:23,577;one by one of your priestesses.
368;00:33:23,804;00:33:26,596;He, too, had a glorious destiny.
369;00:33:26,813;00:33:31,996;He attacked King's Landing and was
369;00:33:26,813;00:33:31,996;soundly defeated by the man standing beside me.
370;00:33:32,188;00:33:34,716;Last I had heard,
370;00:33:32,188;00:33:34,716;he had been defeated again,
371;00:33:34,726;00:33:38,779;this time at Winterfell
371;00:33:34,726;00:33:38,779;and this time for good.
372;00:33:38,898;00:33:41,929;We'd be most grateful for any
372;00:33:38,898;00:33:41,929;support you could provide the queen.
373;00:33:41,940;00:33:45,379;I suppose it's hard for a
373;00:33:41,940;00:33:45,379;fanatic to admit a mistake.
374;00:33:45,613;00:33:48,389;Isn't that the whole
374;00:33:45,613;00:33:48,389;point of being a fanatic?
375;00:33:48,746;00:33:53,800;You're always right.
375;00:33:48,746;00:33:53,800;Everything is the Lord's will.
376;00:33:55,009;00:33:57,422;Everything is the Lord's will.
377;00:33:57,849;00:34:00,322;But men and women make mistakes.
378;00:34:00,785;00:34:02,656;Even honest servants of the Lord.
379;00:34:02,738;00:34:06,184;And you, an honest servant of the Lord,
380;00:34:06,758;00:34:11,043;why should I trust you to know any more
380;00:34:06,758;00:34:11,043;than the priestess who counseled Stannis?
381;00:34:11,170;00:34:17,000;My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion,
381;00:34:11,170;00:34:17,000;but we are all loyal supporters of the queen.
382;00:34:22,271;00:34:26,037;Everyone is what they are
382;00:34:22,271;00:34:26,037;and where they are for a reason.
383;00:34:28,230;00:34:31,006;Terrible things happen for a reason.
384;00:34:31,954;00:34:35,197;Take what happened to you,
384;00:34:31,954;00:34:35,197;Lord Varys, when you were a child.
385;00:34:36,502;00:34:40,448;If not for your mutilation
385;00:34:36,502;00:34:40,448;at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer,
386;00:34:40,480;00:34:41,835;you wouldn't be here
387;00:34:42,222;00:34:46,219;helping the Lord's Chosen
387;00:34:42,222;00:34:46,219;bring his light into the world.
388;00:34:47,148;00:34:49,600;Knowledge has made you powerful.
389;00:34:51,085;00:34:53,570;But there's still so much you don't know.
390;00:34:55,768;00:34:58,622;Do you remember
390;00:34:55,768;00:34:58,622;what you heard that night
391;00:34:59,006;00:35:02,461;when the sorcerer
391;00:34:59,006;00:35:02,461;tossed your parts in the fire?
392;00:35:04,375;00:35:08,346;You heard a voice call out
392;00:35:04,375;00:35:08,346;from the flames. Do you remember?
393;00:35:10,473;00:35:12,911;Should I tell you what the voice said?
394;00:35:14,344;00:35:18,135;Should I tell you the
394;00:35:14,344;00:35:18,135;name of the one who spoke?
395;00:35:27,652;00:35:29,929;We serve the same queen.
396;00:35:30,131;00:35:34,614;If you are her true friend,
396;00:35:30,131;00:35:34,614;you have nothing to fear from me.
397;00:37:24,283;00:37:26,116;What?
398;00:39:09,677;00:39:12,685;He saw me, the Night King!
399;00:39:12,719;00:39:13,970;He saw me!
399;00:39:12,719;00:39:13,970;He touched you.
400;00:39:15,768;00:39:17,572;I don't know. He was close, but...
401;00:39:17,582;00:39:18,855;He touched you.
402;00:39:21,844;00:39:23,972;He knows you are here.
402;00:39:21,844;00:39:23,972;He'll come for you.
403;00:39:24,677;00:39:26,189;But he can't get in.
404;00:39:26,220;00:39:29,315;He can now.
404;00:39:26,220;00:39:29,315;His mark is on you.
405;00:39:29,682;00:39:31,955;You must leave, all of you.
406;00:39:35,766;00:39:37,380;Come on, Hodor.
406;00:39:35,766;00:39:37,380;Help me with the sledge.
407;00:39:37,412;00:39:38,454;Hodor.
408;00:39:39,540;00:39:41,417;I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
409;00:39:41,585;00:39:44,749;The time has come.
409;00:39:41,585;00:39:44,749;The time for what?
410;00:39:45,188;00:39:47,436;For you to become me.
411;00:39:48,791;00:39:51,457;But am I ready?
412;00:39:52,900;00:39:53,944;No.
413;00:39:56,100;00:40:00,252;We can't defend the north from
413;00:39:56,100;00:40:00,252;the walkers and the south from the Boltons.
414;00:40:00,375;00:40:05,070;If we want to survive, we need Winterfell
414;00:40:00,375;00:40:05,070;and to take Winterfell, we need more men.
415;00:40:08,386;00:40:11,025;Aside from the Starks and the Boltons,
416;00:40:11,183;00:40:13,436;the most powerful houses in the North
417;00:40:14,064;00:40:17,280;are the Umbers,
417;00:40:14,064;00:40:17,280;the Karstarks, and the Manderlys.
418;00:40:17,918;00:40:20,350;The Umbers and the Karstarks
419;00:40:20,736;00:40:24,077;have already declared for the Boltons,
419;00:40:20,736;00:40:24,077;so we're not doing so well there.
420;00:40:24,087;00:40:27,536;The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies.
420;00:40:24,087;00:40:27,536;They can hang.
421;00:40:27,546;00:40:32,378;But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay
421;00:40:27,546;00:40:32,378;without knowing they had another choice.
422;00:40:33,171;00:40:37,366;I beg your pardon, my lady, but they
422;00:40:33,171;00:40:37,366;know that a Stark beheaded their father.
423;00:40:37,467;00:40:39,939;I don't think we
423;00:40:37,467;00:40:39,939;can count on them either.
424;00:40:41,486;00:40:43,840;How well do you know
424;00:40:41,486;00:40:43,840;the North, Ser Davos?
425;00:40:44,047;00:40:45,461;Precious little, my lady.
426;00:40:45,471;00:40:48,195;My father always said
426;00:40:45,471;00:40:48,195;Northerners are different.
427;00:40:48,221;00:40:51,686;More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders.
428;00:40:51,696;00:40:53,357;They may well be loyal,
429;00:40:53,368;00:40:55,735;but how many rose
429;00:40:53,368;00:40:55,735;up against the Boltons
430;00:40:55,745;00:40:57,845;when they betrayed your family?
431;00:40:59,337;00:41:02,526;I may not know the North,
431;00:40:59,337;00:41:02,526;but I know men.
432;00:41:02,779;00:41:06,654;They're more or less the same in any corner
432;00:41:02,779;00:41:06,654;of the world and even the bravest of them
433;00:41:07,015;00:41:11,312;don't want to see their wives
433;00:41:07,015;00:41:11,312;and children skinned for a lost cause.
434;00:41:12,165;00:41:14,676;If Jon's going to convince
434;00:41:12,165;00:41:14,676;them to fight alongside him,
435;00:41:14,831;00:41:17,149;they need to believe
435;00:41:14,831;00:41:17,149;it's a fight they can win.
436;00:41:17,159;00:41:19,224;There are more than three
436;00:41:17,159;00:41:19,224;other houses in the North...
437;00:41:19,234;00:41:22,087;Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn,
438;00:41:22,299;00:41:23,771;Mazin, Hornwood.
439;00:41:23,999;00:41:27,181;Two dozen more.
439;00:41:23,999;00:41:27,181;Together they equal all the others.
440;00:41:27,692;00:41:30,203;We can start small and build.
441;00:41:30,214;00:41:31,755;The North remembers.
442;00:41:32,392;00:41:36,052;They remember the Stark name.
442;00:41:32,392;00:41:36,052;People will still risk everything for it, from
443;00:41:36,086;00:41:38,141;White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.
444;00:41:38,151;00:41:39,378;I don't doubt it.
445;00:41:40,635;00:41:42,429;But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.
446;00:41:42,440;00:41:43,840;No, but I do.
447;00:41:48,046;00:41:51,589;Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son
447;00:41:48,046;00:41:51,589;as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's.
448;00:41:52,187;00:41:54,034;And there are also the Tullys.
448;00:41:52,187;00:41:54,034;They're not Northern,
449;00:41:54,135;00:41:57,035;but they will back us against
449;00:41:54,135;00:41:57,035;the Boltons without question.
450;00:41:57,105;00:41:59,104;I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.
451;00:41:59,115;00:42:02,689;My uncle the Blackfish has
451;00:41:59,115;00:42:02,689;reformed it and retaken Riverrun.
452;00:42:03,234;00:42:04,618;How do you know that?
453;00:42:05,593;00:42:09,004;Ramsay received a raven
453;00:42:05,593;00:42:09,004;before I escaped Winterfell.
454;00:42:10,848;00:42:12,091;That's good.
455;00:42:12,796;00:42:16,619;The Blackfish is a legend.
455;00:42:12,796;00:42:16,619;His support would mean a great deal.
456;00:42:17,434;00:42:23,018;Stark, Tully, a few more houses,
456;00:42:17,434;00:42:23,018;almost starts to look like a winning side.
457;00:42:25,066;00:42:27,040;I've sworn to protect you, my lady.
458;00:42:27,051;00:42:28,962;You heard them. We need more men
459;00:42:28,973;00:42:30,746;and my uncle has an army.
460;00:42:30,757;00:42:32,739;We can send the Blackfish a raven.
461;00:42:32,749;00:42:35,973;Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.
461;00:42:32,749;00:42:35,973;It has to be you.
462;00:42:36,338;00:42:40,289;Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk
462;00:42:36,338;00:42:40,289;to you and you'll know how to talk to him.
463;00:42:43,489;00:42:44,532;What is it?
464;00:42:46,526;00:42:48,616;I don't like leaving you here alone.
465;00:42:48,627;00:42:49,669;With Jon?
466;00:42:49,719;00:42:52,648;Not him. He seems trustworthy.
467;00:42:52,659;00:42:54,536;A bit brooding, perhaps.
468;00:42:54,757;00:42:57,264;I suppose that's understandable, considering.
469;00:42:58,539;00:43:00,258;The others, though.
470;00:43:02,632;00:43:06,073;Davos and the Red Woman
470;00:43:02,632;00:43:06,073;helped a man murder his own brother
471;00:43:06,672;00:43:08,282;with bloodmagic.
472;00:43:08,344;00:43:11,025;And when Stannis paid for
472;00:43:08,344;00:43:11,025;his crime, where were they?
473;00:43:11,035;00:43:14,096;Already out looking for a
473;00:43:11,035;00:43:14,096;leader with better prospects.
474;00:43:15,282;00:43:17,215;And that wildling fellow with the beard...
475;00:43:17,225;00:43:18,573;Jon isn't Tormund.
476;00:43:18,926;00:43:22,990;Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman
476;00:43:18,926;00:43:22,990;or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon.
477;00:43:24,169;00:43:26,939;He's my brother.
477;00:43:24,169;00:43:26,939;He'll keep me safe. I trust him.
478;00:43:30,441;00:43:34,590;Then why did you lie to him when he
478;00:43:30,441;00:43:34,590;asked you how you learned about Riverrun?
479;00:43:43,387;00:43:44,679;New dress?
480;00:43:45,507;00:43:47,480;I made it myself. Do you like it?
481;00:43:47,581;00:43:50,932;Yeah, it's...
481;00:43:47,581;00:43:50,932;I like the wolf bit.
482;00:43:52,093;00:43:55,945;Good, because I made this for you.
483;00:43:58,649;00:44:00,920;I made it like the one Father used to wear.
484;00:44:02,048;00:44:04,081;As near as I can remember.
485;00:44:06,173;00:44:07,624;Thank you, Sansa.
486;00:44:07,890;00:44:09,233;You're welcome.
487;00:44:29,771;00:44:31,748;Don't knock it down while I'm gone.
488;00:44:31,857;00:44:33,501;I'll do my best.
489;00:44:39,737;00:44:41,144;Good luck.
490;00:45:12,787;00:45:14,874;Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?
491;00:45:15,205;00:45:16,829;I'm not the Lord Comman...
492;00:45:22,105;00:45:26,432;Yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate.
493;00:45:38,167;00:45:40,230;We can go home now, Hodor.
494;00:45:40,455;00:45:44,693;Well, maybe not home home,
494;00:45:40,455;00:45:44,693;but somewhere that isn't a cave.
495;00:45:45,265;00:45:46,237;Hodor.
496;00:45:46,248;00:45:48,347;Eat something that isn't moss.
497;00:45:50,657;00:45:53,507;I want an egg.
497;00:45:50,657;00:45:53,507;How do you like 'em?
498;00:45:53,529;00:45:56,305;Boiled? Fried up with some butter?
499;00:45:56,509;00:45:57,552;Hodor.
500;00:45:58,539;00:46:01,205;With a rasher of bacon
500;00:45:58,539;00:46:01,205;and some blood sausage.
501;00:46:01,233;00:46:02,275;Hodor.
502;00:47:02,817;00:47:04,785;Get Bran and run!
503;00:47:17,303;00:47:19,286;Bran. Bran, wake up.
504;00:47:19,593;00:47:20,500;Bran!
505;00:47:20,511;00:47:22,030;Hodor. Hodor.
506;00:47:22,394;00:47:23,641;Bran, wake up.
507;00:47:33,726;00:47:36,293;- Gods keep you on the kingsroad.
507;00:47:33,726;00:47:36,293;Take it easy.
508;00:47:36,395;00:47:37,627;Watch yourself.
509;00:47:41,457;00:47:43,051;Hodor.
509;00:47:41,457;00:47:43,051;Hodor.
510;00:47:43,585;00:47:44,628;Hodor.
511;00:47:45,639;00:47:46,723;Help me!
512;00:48:06,488;00:48:07,531;Go!
513;00:48:08,473;00:48:09,516;Go!
514;00:48:57,530;00:48:59,321;Remember that you are a Stark.
515;00:48:59,716;00:49:01,824;Comport yourself with dignity at the Vale
516;00:49:02,858;00:49:05,276;and try to stay out of fights.
516;00:49:02,858;00:49:05,276;Yes, Father.
517;00:49:08,012;00:49:09,894;But if you have to fight...
518;00:49:10,216;00:49:11,259;win.
519;00:49:13,090;00:49:14,874;Bran! Bran, wake up!
520;00:49:27,455;00:49:28,498;Bran!
521;00:49:28,891;00:49:30,333;Bran! Bran, wake up.
522;00:49:30,364;00:49:32,745;Bran! Bran, wake up!
522;00:49:30,364;00:49:32,745;Hodor. Hodor.
523;00:49:39,441;00:49:40,587;You have to wake up.
524;00:49:40,618;00:49:42,653;We need Hodor.
524;00:49:40,618;00:49:42,653;Hodor. Hodor.
525;00:49:42,684;00:49:44,377;Bran, we need Hodor.
525;00:49:42,684;00:49:44,377;Bran, you have to wake up. We need Hodor.
526;00:49:49,727;00:49:51,292;Hodor. Hodor.
527;00:50:00,302;00:50:01,776;Bran, we're all going to die!
528;00:50:02,110;00:50:03,357;Bran, wake up!
529;00:50:03,633;00:50:05,192;We're all going to die! Bran!
530;00:50:05,686;00:50:06,729;Bran!
531;00:50:07,153;00:50:09,076;Bran, you have to wake up. We need Hodor.

533;00:50:10,608;00:50:12,601;Warg into Hodor now!
534;00:50:12,850;00:50:14,822;Bran, wake up. We need Hodor.
535;00:50:15,493;00:50:18,433;We need Hodor.

536;00:50:18,580;00:50:20,377;Listen to your friend, Brandon.

544;00:52:17,419;00:52:18,481;What are you doing?
545;00:52:18,492;00:52:19,570;Go!
546;00:53:08,327;00:53:09,676;Hodor, hurry!

554;00:54:03,838;00:54:04,903;What's the matter?
