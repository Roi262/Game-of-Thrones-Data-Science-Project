1;00:00:03,700;00:00:06,030;The Lannisters have declared war
﻿1;00:00:03,700;00:00:06,030;on House Tyrell.
2;00:00:06,030;00:00:07,280;They have declared war on Dorne.
3;00:00:07,580;00:00:10,780;We must be allies now,
3;00:00:07,580;00:00:10,780;if we wish to survive.
4;00:00:11,320;00:00:13,870;I offer vengeance...
4;00:00:11,320;00:00:13,870;justice...
5;00:00:14,320;00:00:15,700;Fire and blood.
6;00:00:17,530;00:00:18,570;I traveled south
7;00:00:18,580;00:00:20,320;under orders
7;00:00:18,580;00:00:20,320;from the Lord Commander.
8;00:00:20,660;00:00:22,660;You ought to be a Maester.
9;00:00:22,870;00:00:25,070;Spending your life reading
9;00:00:22,870;00:00:25,070;about the achievements
10;00:00:25,070;00:00:26,200;of better men.
11;00:00:26,580;00:00:28,070;It's a map of Dragonstone.
12;00:00:28,070;00:00:29,200;That's dragonglass.
13;00:00:29,450;00:00:30,830;A mountain of it,
13;00:00:29,450;00:00:30,830;beneath the ground.
14;00:00:31,030;00:00:32,200;John needs to know.
15;00:00:32,950;00:00:33,830;You must send me away.
16;00:00:34,200;00:00:36,120;I command you to heal yourself.
17;00:00:36,120;00:00:38,410;I command you to find the cure.
18;00:00:45,280;00:00:48,410;So why's a nice girl on her own
18;00:00:45,280;00:00:48,410;heading to King's Landing?
19;00:00:48,830;00:00:50,240;I'm going to kill the queen.
20;00:00:51,740;00:00:53,530;I invited Euron Greyjoy,
21;00:00:53,530;00:00:55,200;the new king
21;00:00:53,530;00:00:55,200;of the Iron Islands.
22;00:00:57,660;00:01:01,070;The Iron Fleet is the greatest
22;00:00:57,660;00:01:01,070;armada Westeros has ever seen.
23;00:01:01,580;00:01:04,280;The surest way to
23;00:01:01,580;00:01:04,280;a woman's heart is with a gift.
24;00:01:04,280;00:01:07,370;I won't return to King's Landing
24;00:01:04,280;00:01:07,370;until I have that for you.
25;00:01:10,410;00:01:11,240;Shall we begin?
26;00:03:39,240;00:03:42,030;Tyrion:
26;00:03:39,240;00:03:42,030;On a night like this,
26;00:03:39,240;00:03:42,030;you came into the world.
27;00:03:42,030;00:03:43,320;Varys:
27;00:03:42,030;00:03:43,320;I remember that storm.
28;00:03:43,320;00:03:46,070;All the dogs in King's Landing
29;00:03:46,070;00:03:48,070;howled through the night.
30;00:03:48,070;00:03:49,700;I wish I could remember it.
31;00:03:49,700;00:03:52,620;I always thought
31;00:03:49,700;00:03:52,620;this would be a homecoming.
32;00:03:52,620;00:03:54,410;Doesn't feel like home.
33;00:03:54,410;00:03:56,740;We won't stay
33;00:03:54,410;00:03:56,740;on Dragonstone for long.
34;00:03:56,740;00:03:58,030;Good.
35;00:03:59,450;00:04:01,280;Daenerys:
35;00:03:59,450;00:04:01,280;Not so many lions.
36;00:04:01,280;00:04:04,200;Varys:
36;00:04:01,280;00:04:04,200;Cersei controls fewer
36;00:04:01,280;00:04:04,200;than half the Seven Kingdoms.
37;00:04:04,200;00:04:06,490;The lords of Westeros
37;00:04:04,200;00:04:06,490;despise her.
38;00:04:06,490;00:04:09,370;Even before your arrival,
38;00:04:06,490;00:04:09,370;they plotted against her.
39;00:04:09,370;00:04:12,870;Now...
39;00:04:09,370;00:04:12,870;They cry out
39;00:04:09,370;00:04:12,870;for their true queen?
40;00:04:12,870;00:04:15,490;They drink secret toasts
40;00:04:12,870;00:04:15,490;to my health?
41;00:04:15,490;00:04:17,450;People used to
41;00:04:15,490;00:04:17,450;tell my brother
41;00:04:15,490;00:04:17,450;that sort of thing,
42;00:04:17,450;00:04:19,490;and he was stupid enough
42;00:04:17,450;00:04:19,490;to believe them.
43;00:04:24,280;00:04:28,320;If Viserys had three dragons
43;00:04:24,280;00:04:28,320;and an army at his back,
44;00:04:28,320;00:04:30,320;he'd have invaded
44;00:04:28,320;00:04:30,320;King's Landing already.
45;00:04:30,320;00:04:32,910;Conquering Westeros
45;00:04:30,320;00:04:32,910;would be easy for you.
46;00:04:32,910;00:04:35,320;But you're not here
46;00:04:32,910;00:04:35,320;to be queen of the ashes.
47;00:04:36,950;00:04:38,070;No.
48;00:04:38,070;00:04:40,320;We can take the Seven Kingdoms
49;00:04:40,320;00:04:43,200;without turning it
49;00:04:40,320;00:04:43,200;into a slaughterhouse.
50;00:04:43,200;00:04:45,780;If the great houses support
50;00:04:43,200;00:04:45,780;your claim against Cersei,
51;00:04:45,780;00:04:47,870;the game is won.
52;00:04:47,870;00:04:50,320;With the Tyrell army
52;00:04:47,870;00:04:50,320;and the Dornish
52;00:04:47,870;00:04:50,320;on our side,
53;00:04:50,320;00:04:53,490;we have powerful allies
53;00:04:50,320;00:04:53,490;in the south.
54;00:04:53,490;00:04:56,070;I never properly
54;00:04:53,490;00:04:56,070;thanked you for that.
55;00:04:56,070;00:04:58,820;They joined our side, my queen,
56;00:04:58,830;00:05:01,370;because they believe in you.
57;00:05:01,370;00:05:03,700;You served my father,
57;00:05:01,370;00:05:03,700;didn't you, Lord Varys?
58;00:05:05,030;00:05:06,320;I did.
59;00:05:06,320;00:05:07,660;And then you served
59;00:05:06,320;00:05:07,660;the man who overthrew him.
60;00:05:07,660;00:05:09,410;I had a choice,
60;00:05:07,660;00:05:09,410;Your Grace...
61;00:05:09,410;00:05:11,530;Serve Robert Baratheon
61;00:05:09,410;00:05:11,530;or face the headman's axe.
62;00:05:11,530;00:05:13,870;But you didn't serve him long.
63;00:05:13,870;00:05:15,320;You turned against him.
64;00:05:16,780;00:05:20,490;Robert was an improvement
64;00:05:16,780;00:05:20,490;on your father, to be sure.
65;00:05:20,490;00:05:22,570;There have been
65;00:05:20,490;00:05:22,570;few rulers in history
66;00:05:22,580;00:05:24,660;as cruel as the Mad King.
67;00:05:24,660;00:05:27,120;Robert was
67;00:05:24,660;00:05:27,120;neither mad nor cruel.
68;00:05:27,120;00:05:29,660;He simply had no interest
68;00:05:27,120;00:05:29,660;in being king.
69;00:05:29,660;00:05:32,370;So you took it upon yourself
69;00:05:29,660;00:05:32,370;to find a better one.
70;00:05:32,370;00:05:34,570;Your Grace,
71;00:05:34,580;00:05:37,570;when I was
71;00:05:34,580;00:05:37,570;ready to drink myself
71;00:05:34,580;00:05:37,570;into a small coffin,
72;00:05:37,580;00:05:39,620;Lord Varys told me about
72;00:05:37,580;00:05:39,620;a queen in the east who...
73;00:05:39,620;00:05:42,530;Before I came to power,
73;00:05:39,620;00:05:42,530;you favored my brother.
74;00:05:43,950;00:05:47,240;All your spies,
74;00:05:43,950;00:05:47,240;your little birds,
75;00:05:47,240;00:05:50,910;did they tell you Viserys
75;00:05:47,240;00:05:50,910;was cruel, stupid, and weak?
76;00:05:53,030;00:05:57,530;Would those qualities
76;00:05:53,030;00:05:57,530;have made for a good king
76;00:05:53,030;00:05:57,530;in your learned opinion?
77;00:05:57,530;00:06:00,200;Until your marriage
77;00:05:57,530;00:06:00,200;to Khal Drogo, Your Grace,
78;00:06:00,200;00:06:02,700;I knew nothing about you,
78;00:06:00,200;00:06:02,700;save your existence
79;00:06:02,700;00:06:05,030;and that you were said
79;00:06:02,700;00:06:05,030;to be beautiful.
80;00:06:05,030;00:06:08,740;So you and your friends
80;00:06:05,030;00:06:08,740;traded me like a prized horse
80;00:06:05,030;00:06:08,740;to the Dothraki.
81;00:06:08,740;00:06:10,740;Which you turned
81;00:06:08,740;00:06:10,740;to your advantage.
82;00:06:10,740;00:06:12,780;Who gave the order to kill me?
83;00:06:16,780;00:06:18,820;King Robert.
84;00:06:18,830;00:06:21,570;Who hired the assassins?
85;00:06:21,580;00:06:24,740;Who sent word to Essos
85;00:06:21,580;00:06:24,740;to murder Daenerys Targaryen?
86;00:06:24,740;00:06:29,280;Your Grace, I did
86;00:06:24,740;00:06:29,280;what had to be done to...
86;00:06:24,740;00:06:29,280;To keep yourself alive.
87;00:06:29,280;00:06:31,570;Lord Varys
87;00:06:29,280;00:06:31,570;has proven himself
87;00:06:29,280;00:06:31,570;a loyal servant.
88;00:06:31,580;00:06:33,370;Proven himself loyal?
88;00:06:31,580;00:06:33,370;Quite the opposite.
89;00:06:33,370;00:06:37,070;If he dislikes one monarch,
89;00:06:33,370;00:06:37,070;he conspires to crown
89;00:06:33,370;00:06:37,070;the next one.
90;00:06:37,070;00:06:39,490;What kind of a servant is that?
91;00:06:39,490;00:06:41,620;The kind the realm needs.
92;00:06:41,620;00:06:44,990;Incompetence should not
92;00:06:41,620;00:06:44,990;be rewarded with
92;00:06:41,620;00:06:44,990;blind loyalty.
93;00:06:44,990;00:06:47,950;As long
93;00:06:44,990;00:06:47,950;as I have my eyes,
93;00:06:44,990;00:06:47,950;I'll use them.
94;00:06:49,660;00:06:51,660;I wasn't born
94;00:06:49,660;00:06:51,660;into a great house.
95;00:06:51,660;00:06:54,240;I came from nothing.
96;00:06:54,240;00:06:57,200;I was sold as a slave
96;00:06:54,240;00:06:57,200;and carved up as an offering.
97;00:06:57,200;00:07:01,030;When I was a child,
97;00:06:57,200;00:07:01,030;I lived in alleys, gutters,
97;00:06:57,200;00:07:01,030;abandoned houses.
98;00:07:01,030;00:07:03,620;You wish to know
98;00:07:01,030;00:07:03,620;where my true loyalties lie?
99;00:07:03,620;00:07:06,820;Not with any king or queen,
99;00:07:03,620;00:07:06,820;but with the people.
100;00:07:06,830;00:07:10,780;The people
100;00:07:06,830;00:07:10,780;who suffer under despots
100;00:07:06,830;00:07:10,780;and prosper under just rule.
101;00:07:10,780;00:07:13,160;The people whose hearts
101;00:07:10,780;00:07:13,160;you aim to win.
102;00:07:14,950;00:07:18,870;If you demand blind allegiance,
103;00:07:18,870;00:07:21,620;I respect your wishes.
104;00:07:21,620;00:07:25,620;Grey Worm can behead me
104;00:07:21,620;00:07:25,620;or your dragons
104;00:07:21,620;00:07:25,620;can devour me.
105;00:07:25,620;00:07:28,200;But if you let me live,
105;00:07:25,620;00:07:28,200;I will serve you well.
106;00:07:28,200;00:07:31,490;I will dedicate myself
106;00:07:28,200;00:07:31,490;to seeing you on
106;00:07:28,200;00:07:31,490;the Iron Throne
107;00:07:31,490;00:07:33,990;because I choose you.
108;00:07:33,990;00:07:37,530;Because I know the people
108;00:07:33,990;00:07:37,530;have no better chance
108;00:07:33,990;00:07:37,530;than you.
109;00:07:45,830;00:07:47,990;Swear this to me, Varys.
110;00:07:49,490;00:07:52,950;If you ever think
110;00:07:49,490;00:07:52,950;I'm failing the people,
111;00:07:52,950;00:07:56,160;you won't conspire
111;00:07:52,950;00:07:56,160;behind my back.
112;00:07:56,160;00:07:58,120;You'll look me in the eye
112;00:07:56,160;00:07:58,120;as you have done today,
113;00:07:58,120;00:07:59,950;and you'll tell me
113;00:07:58,120;00:07:59,950;how I'm failing them.
114;00:08:02,830;00:08:04,950;I swear it, my queen.
115;00:08:11,280;00:08:15,200;And I swear this...
115;00:08:11,280;00:08:15,200;If you ever betray me,
116;00:08:15,200;00:08:16,910;I'll burn you alive.
117;00:08:20,240;00:08:23,660;I would expect nothing less
117;00:08:20,240;00:08:23,660;from the Mother of Dragons.
118;00:08:26,740;00:08:28,700;Forgive me, my queen.
119;00:08:28,700;00:08:31,870;A red priestess from As'shai
119;00:08:28,700;00:08:31,870;has come to see you.
120;00:09:08,160;00:09:11,950;She once served another
120;00:09:08,160;00:09:11,950;who wanted the Iron Throne.
121;00:09:11,950;00:09:15,870;It didn't end well
121;00:09:11,950;00:09:15,870;for Stannis Baratheon,
121;00:09:11,950;00:09:15,870;did it?
122;00:09:15,870;00:09:17,530;No, it didn't.
123;00:09:17,530;00:09:21,370;You chose an auspicious day
123;00:09:17,530;00:09:21,370;to arrive at Dragonstone.
124;00:09:21,370;00:09:23,240;We've just decided
124;00:09:21,370;00:09:23,240;to pardon those
125;00:09:23,240;00:09:25,910;who once served the wrong king.
126;00:09:29,870;00:09:33,240;The Lord of Light
126;00:09:29,870;00:09:33,240;doesn't have many followers
126;00:09:29,870;00:09:33,240;in Westeros, does he?
127;00:09:33,240;00:09:36,910;Not yet, but even those
127;00:09:33,240;00:09:36,910;who don't worship the Lord
128;00:09:36,910;00:09:38,410;can serve his cause.
129;00:09:38,410;00:09:40,320;What does your lord
129;00:09:38,410;00:09:40,320;expect from me?
130;00:09:46,120;00:09:48,660;The prince who was promised
130;00:09:46,120;00:09:48,660;will bring the dawn.
131;00:09:50,200;00:09:51,950;I'm afraid I'm not a prince.
132;00:09:51,950;00:09:53,530;Missandei:
132;00:09:51,950;00:09:53,530;Your Grace,
132;00:09:51,950;00:09:53,530;forgive me,
133;00:09:53,530;00:09:56,490;but your translation
133;00:09:53,530;00:09:56,490;is not quite accurate.
134;00:09:56,490;00:09:59,240;That noun has no gender
134;00:09:56,490;00:09:59,240;in High Valyrian,
135;00:09:59,240;00:10:02,200;so the proper translation
135;00:09:59,240;00:10:02,200;for that prophecy would be,
136;00:10:02,200;00:10:06,570;The prince or princess
136;00:10:02,200;00:10:06,570;who was promised will
136;00:10:02,200;00:10:06,570;bring the dawn.
137;00:10:06,580;00:10:08,740;Doesn't really roll
137;00:10:06,580;00:10:08,740;off the tongue, does it?
138;00:10:08,740;00:10:10,280;No, but I like it better.
139;00:10:11,870;00:10:13,820;And you believe
139;00:10:11,870;00:10:13,820;this prophecy
139;00:10:11,870;00:10:13,820;refers to me?
140;00:10:13,830;00:10:16,620;Prophecies are dangerous things.
141;00:10:16,620;00:10:19,950;I believe you have
141;00:10:16,620;00:10:19,950;a role to play.
142;00:10:19,950;00:10:21,820;As does another...
143;00:10:21,830;00:10:24,320;The King in the North, Jon Snow.
144;00:10:25,620;00:10:27,030;Jon Snow?
145;00:10:27,030;00:10:29,820;Ned Stark's bastard?
145;00:10:27,030;00:10:29,820;You know him?
146;00:10:29,830;00:10:32,990;I travelled with him
146;00:10:29,830;00:10:32,990;to the Wall when he joined
146;00:10:29,830;00:10:32,990;the Night's Watch.
147;00:10:32,990;00:10:37,120;And why do you
147;00:10:32,990;00:10:37,120;think the Lord of Light
147;00:10:32,990;00:10:37,120;singled out this Jon Snow?
148;00:10:37,120;00:10:39,820;Aside from the visions
148;00:10:37,120;00:10:39,820;you've seen in the flames,
148;00:10:37,120;00:10:39,820;that is.
149;00:10:39,830;00:10:42,740;As Lord Commander
149;00:10:39,830;00:10:42,740;of the Night's Watch,
150;00:10:42,740;00:10:44,990;he allowed the wildlings
150;00:10:42,740;00:10:44,990;south of the Wall
151;00:10:44,990;00:10:47,070;to protect them
151;00:10:44,990;00:10:47,070;from grave danger.
152;00:10:47,070;00:10:48,660;As King in the North,
153;00:10:48,660;00:10:51,490;he has united those wildlings
153;00:10:48,660;00:10:51,490;with the Northern houses,
154;00:10:51,490;00:10:53,990;so together they may
154;00:10:51,490;00:10:53,990;face their common enemy.
155;00:10:53,990;00:10:56,120;He sounds like quite a man.
156;00:10:56,120;00:10:58,490;Summon Jon Snow.
157;00:10:58,490;00:11:00,160;Let him stand before you
158;00:11:00,160;00:11:01,780;and tell you the things
158;00:11:00,160;00:11:01,780;that have happened to him,
159;00:11:01,780;00:11:05,410;the things
159;00:11:01,780;00:11:05,410;that he has seen
159;00:11:01,780;00:11:05,410;with his own eyes.
160;00:11:06,950;00:11:08,570;I can't speak to prophecies
161;00:11:08,580;00:11:11,200;or visions in the flames,
162;00:11:11,200;00:11:13,990;but I like Jon Snow
162;00:11:11,200;00:11:13,990;and I trusted him.
163;00:11:13,990;00:11:16,490;And I am an excellent
163;00:11:13,990;00:11:16,490;judge of character.
164;00:11:16,490;00:11:18,950;If he does rule the North,
165;00:11:18,950;00:11:20,700;he would make a valuable ally.
166;00:11:22,030;00:11:23,950;The Lannisters
166;00:11:22,030;00:11:23,950;executed his father
167;00:11:23,950;00:11:26,120;and conspired
167;00:11:23,950;00:11:26,120;to murder his brother.
168;00:11:26,120;00:11:29,320;Jon Snow has even more reason
168;00:11:26,120;00:11:29,320;to hate Cersei than you do.
169;00:11:33,700;00:11:35,490;Very well.
170;00:11:35,490;00:11:37,280;Send a raven north.
171;00:11:37,280;00:11:39,280;Tell Jon Snow that his queen
172;00:11:39,280;00:11:42,280;invites him to come
172;00:11:39,280;00:11:42,280;to Dragonstone...
173;00:11:42,280;00:11:44,030;and bend the knee.
174;00:11:53,580;00:11:56,570;Gather round.
174;00:11:53,580;00:11:56,570;Come here.
175;00:11:56,580;00:11:59,070;Sansa:
175;00:11:56,580;00:11:59,070;You think
175;00:11:56,580;00:11:59,070;it's really Tyrion?
176;00:11:59,070;00:12:02,570;It could be someone
176;00:11:59,070;00:12:02,570;trying to lure you
176;00:11:59,070;00:12:02,570;into a trap.
177;00:12:02,580;00:12:04,120;Read the last bit.
178;00:12:04,120;00:12:08,740;All dwarves are bastards
178;00:12:04,120;00:12:08,740;in their father's eyes.
179;00:12:08,740;00:12:10,490;What does that mean?
180;00:12:10,490;00:12:13,410;It's something he said to me
180;00:12:10,490;00:12:13,410;the first night we met.
181;00:12:14,740;00:12:16,580;You know him better
181;00:12:14,740;00:12:16,580;than any of us.
182;00:12:17,740;00:12:18,740;What do you think?
183;00:12:22,200;00:12:24,820;Tyrion's not like
183;00:12:22,200;00:12:24,820;the other Lannisters.
184;00:12:24,830;00:12:28,620;He was always kind to me,
184;00:12:24,830;00:12:28,620;but it's too great a risk.
185;00:12:28,620;00:12:30,620;The Seven Kingdoms will bleed
186;00:12:30,620;00:12:33,120;as long as Cersei sits
186;00:12:30,620;00:12:33,120;on the Iron Throne.
187;00:12:33,120;00:12:34,280;Join us.
188;00:12:34,280;00:12:36,120;Together, we can
188;00:12:34,280;00:12:36,120;end her tyranny.
189;00:12:40,280;00:12:42,280;Sounds like a charmer.
190;00:12:42,280;00:12:44,490;Of course,
190;00:12:42,280;00:12:44,490;the casual mention
190;00:12:42,280;00:12:44,490;of a Dothraki horde,
191;00:12:44,490;00:12:47,450;a legion of Unsullied,
191;00:12:44,490;00:12:47,450;and three dragons...
192;00:12:47,450;00:12:48,990;A bit less charming.
193;00:12:51,120;00:12:52,160;What?
194;00:12:52,160;00:12:55,410;Fire kills wights, you told me.
195;00:12:55,410;00:12:56,580;What breathes fire?
196;00:12:58,660;00:13:00,780;You're not suggesting
196;00:12:58,660;00:13:00,780;Jon meet with her?
197;00:13:00,780;00:13:03,200;No, too dangerous.
197;00:13:00,780;00:13:03,200;But?
198;00:13:03,200;00:13:06,160;But if the Army of the Dead
198;00:13:03,200;00:13:06,160;makes it past the Wall,
199;00:13:06,160;00:13:08,660;do we have enough men
199;00:13:06,160;00:13:08,660;to fight them?
200;00:13:12,990;00:13:15,370;If the Mad King's daughter
200;00:13:12,990;00:13:15,370;takes the Iron Throne,
201;00:13:15,370;00:13:17,280;she'll destroy the realm
201;00:13:15,370;00:13:17,280;as we know it.
202;00:13:18,620;00:13:21,530;Some of you are bannermen
202;00:13:18,620;00:13:21,530;of House Tyrell.
203;00:13:21,530;00:13:24,660;But House Tyrell
203;00:13:21,530;00:13:24,660;is in open rebellion
203;00:13:21,530;00:13:24,660;against the crown.
204;00:13:24,660;00:13:27,870;With their help,
204;00:13:24,660;00:13:27,870;the Mad King's daughter
205;00:13:27,870;00:13:31,370;has ferried
205;00:13:27,870;00:13:31,370;an army of savages
205;00:13:27,870;00:13:31,370;to our shores...
206;00:13:31,370;00:13:35,160;Mindless Unsullied soldiers
206;00:13:31,370;00:13:35,160;who will destroy your castles
206;00:13:31,370;00:13:35,160;and your holdfasts,
207;00:13:35,160;00:13:39,320;Dothraki heathens
207;00:13:35,160;00:13:39,320;who will burn your
207;00:13:35,160;00:13:39,320;villages to the ground,
208;00:13:39,320;00:13:41,530;rape and enslave your women,
209;00:13:41,530;00:13:44,450;and butcher your children
209;00:13:41,530;00:13:44,450;without a second thought.
210;00:13:44,450;00:13:49,320;This is how Olenna Tyrell
210;00:13:44,450;00:13:49,320;rewards centuries of service
210;00:13:44,450;00:13:49,320;and loyalty.
211;00:13:49,320;00:13:52,160;Cersei: You all remember
211;00:13:49,320;00:13:52,160;the Mad King.
212;00:13:52,160;00:13:55,700;You remember the horrors
212;00:13:52,160;00:13:55,700;he inflicted upon his people.
213;00:13:55,700;00:13:57,700;His daughter is no different.
214;00:13:57,700;00:14:00,490;In Essos, her brutality
214;00:13:57,700;00:14:00,490;is already legendary.
215;00:14:00,490;00:14:04,780;She crucified
215;00:14:00,490;00:14:04,780;hundreds of noblemen
215;00:14:00,490;00:14:04,780;in Slaver's Bay.
216;00:14:04,780;00:14:07,450;And when she grew bored of that,
217;00:14:07,450;00:14:09,700;she fed them to her dragons.
218;00:14:09,700;00:14:13,280;It is my solemn duty
218;00:14:09,700;00:14:13,280;to protect the people,
218;00:14:09,700;00:14:13,280;and I will.
219;00:14:13,280;00:14:16,450;But I need your help, my lords.
220;00:14:16,450;00:14:19,240;We must stand together,
220;00:14:16,450;00:14:19,240;all of us...
221;00:14:20,450;00:14:22,450;if we hope to stop her.
222;00:14:27,780;00:14:30,870;She has three
222;00:14:27,780;00:14:30,870;full-grown dragons,
222;00:14:27,780;00:14:30,870;Your Grace.
223;00:14:32,240;00:14:34,030;The same as Aegon
223;00:14:32,240;00:14:34,030;when he conquered
224;00:14:34,030;00:14:36,530;the Seven Kingdoms.
225;00:14:36,530;00:14:38,910;How do you propose to stop them?
226;00:14:42,580;00:14:46,700;We are currently at work
226;00:14:42,580;00:14:46,700;on a solution, my lord.
227;00:14:53,580;00:14:54,580;Lord Tarly.
228;00:14:56,410;00:14:58,320;Ser Jaime.
229;00:14:58,320;00:15:00,030;I believe you know my son.
230;00:15:00,030;00:15:01,030;Ser Jaime.
231;00:15:01,030;00:15:02,530;Rickard, isn't it?
232;00:15:02,530;00:15:04,240;Dickon.
233;00:15:04,240;00:15:05,780;That's it.
234;00:15:05,780;00:15:07,780;Thank you for coming.
235;00:15:07,780;00:15:11,700;The other lords of the Reach
235;00:15:07,780;00:15:11,700;look to you for guidance,
235;00:15:07,780;00:15:11,700;now more than ever.
236;00:15:11,700;00:15:13,410;They might not have come
236;00:15:11,700;00:15:13,410;if you hadn't.
237;00:15:13,410;00:15:16,700;If my queen summons me,
237;00:15:13,410;00:15:16,700;I answer the call.
238;00:15:16,700;00:15:19,490;And I've heard
238;00:15:16,700;00:15:19,490;what she does to
238;00:15:16,700;00:15:19,490;those who defy her.
239;00:15:22,370;00:15:24,740;You ride for Horn Hill today?
240;00:15:24,740;00:15:27,450;I have an army to mobilize.
241;00:15:27,450;00:15:29,780;Won't be long before
241;00:15:27,450;00:15:29,780;the fighting starts.
242;00:15:29,780;00:15:32,240;And which side
242;00:15:29,780;00:15:32,240;will you be fighting for?
243;00:15:33,830;00:15:36,570;You were the only man to defeat
243;00:15:33,830;00:15:36,570;Robert Baratheon in battle.
244;00:15:36,580;00:15:38,490;Not even Rhaegar Targaryen
244;00:15:36,580;00:15:38,490;could do that.
245;00:15:38,490;00:15:41,450;It's a long ride back
245;00:15:38,490;00:15:41,450;to the Reach, Ser Jaime.
245;00:15:38,490;00:15:41,450;How may I serve?
246;00:15:41,450;00:15:44,410;I want you to be
246;00:15:41,450;00:15:44,410;my ranking general
246;00:15:41,450;00:15:44,410;in the wars to come.
247;00:15:44,410;00:15:46,530;I want you to swear
247;00:15:44,410;00:15:46,530;allegiance to Cersei
248;00:15:46,530;00:15:49,530;and I want you to help me
248;00:15:46,530;00:15:49,530;destroy her enemies.
249;00:15:49,530;00:15:51,370;All her enemies.
250;00:15:51,370;00:15:53,410;Including Olenna Tyrell.
251;00:15:56,160;00:15:58,660;I'm a Tarly.
252;00:15:58,660;00:16:00,160;That name means something.
253;00:16:01,660;00:16:04,200;We're not oathbreakers.
253;00:16:01,660;00:16:04,200;We're not schemers.
254;00:16:04,200;00:16:06,660;We don't stab
254;00:16:04,200;00:16:06,660;our rivals in the back
255;00:16:06,660;00:16:09,490;or cut their throats
255;00:16:06,660;00:16:09,490;at weddings.
256;00:16:11,620;00:16:14,530;I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
257;00:16:14,530;00:16:17,870;You swore an oath
257;00:16:14,530;00:16:17,870;to the crown as well,
257;00:16:14,530;00:16:17,870;Lord Tarly.
258;00:16:19,280;00:16:21,660;I've known Olenna
258;00:16:19,280;00:16:21,660;since I was a child.
259;00:16:21,660;00:16:24,280;She was a great woman once.
260;00:16:24,280;00:16:26,660;Now she's broken.
261;00:16:26,660;00:16:28,780;She wants revenge so badly,
262;00:16:28,780;00:16:31,030;she brought the Dothraki
262;00:16:28,780;00:16:31,030;to our shores.
263;00:16:31,030;00:16:34,950;The Dothraki in Westeros
263;00:16:31,030;00:16:34,950;for the first time
263;00:16:31,030;00:16:34,950;in history.
264;00:16:37,620;00:16:39,870;I know you don't like my sister,
265;00:16:39,870;00:16:43,030;but you have to make a choice.
266;00:16:43,030;00:16:45,070;Do you fight with us
267;00:16:45,070;00:16:47,200;or with foreign savages
267;00:16:45,070;00:16:47,200;and eunuchs?
268;00:16:52,450;00:16:54,700;When the war is won,
269;00:16:54,700;00:16:57,870;the queen will need
269;00:16:54,700;00:16:57,870;a new Warden of the South.
270;00:16:57,870;00:17:00,700;I can think of no better man
271;00:17:00,700;00:17:02,530;than Randyll Tarly.
272;00:17:04,580;00:17:07,370;Ebrose:
272;00:17:04,580;00:17:07,370;The infection
272;00:17:04,580;00:17:07,370;has spread too far.
273;00:17:07,370;00:17:10,320;You should have
273;00:17:07,370;00:17:10,320;cut off your arm
273;00:17:07,370;00:17:10,320;the moment you were touched.
274;00:17:13,030;00:17:14,160;How long?
275;00:17:16,910;00:17:19,030;It'll be years
275;00:17:16,910;00:17:19,030;before it kills you.
276;00:17:19,030;00:17:20,620;Could be 10.
277;00:17:20,620;00:17:22,280;Could be 20.
278;00:17:22,280;00:17:24,030;But how long until...?
279;00:17:25,450;00:17:27,530;Your mind?
280;00:17:27,530;00:17:30,410;Six months, maybe fewer.
281;00:17:43,070;00:17:44,200;Um...
282;00:17:45,740;00:17:48,910;Pardon, Archmaester.
283;00:17:48,910;00:17:51,910;I met Stannis Baratheon's
283;00:17:48,910;00:17:51,910;daughter at Castle Black.
284;00:17:51,910;00:17:54,370;She had the greyscale
284;00:17:51,910;00:17:54,370;as a baby and was cured.
285;00:17:54,370;00:17:55,950;Ebrose: No.
285;00:17:54,370;00:17:55,950;Isn't there some way...
286;00:17:55,950;00:17:57,740;Ebrose:
286;00:17:55,950;00:17:57,740;Does this look like
286;00:17:55,950;00:17:57,740;a baby to you?
287;00:17:57,740;00:17:59,070;No.
287;00:17:57,740;00:17:59,070;Have you studied
288;00:17:59,070;00:18:01,120;the varying rates
288;00:17:59,070;00:18:01,120;of greyscale progression
289;00:18:01,120;00:18:02,740;in infants and fully grown men?
290;00:18:04,780;00:18:06,160;No.
291;00:18:07,950;00:18:09,530;Ebrose:
291;00:18:07,950;00:18:09,530;Maester Cressen discovered.
292;00:18:09,530;00:18:12,120;Shireen Baratheon's
292;00:18:09,530;00:18:12,120;affliction immediately.
293;00:18:13,580;00:18:15,280;This is quite advanced.
294;00:18:17,120;00:18:19,320;And beyond our skills, ser.
295;00:18:22,780;00:18:25,740;Were you a commoner,
295;00:18:22,780;00:18:25,740;I'd have you shipped
295;00:18:22,780;00:18:25,740;to Valyria at once
296;00:18:25,740;00:18:28,280;to live out your life
296;00:18:25,740;00:18:28,280;with the stone men.
297;00:18:28,280;00:18:32,120;As an anointed knight,
297;00:18:28,280;00:18:32,120;I'll allow you one more day.
298;00:18:34,910;00:18:37,450;How you choose
298;00:18:34,910;00:18:37,450;to spend that time
298;00:18:34,910;00:18:37,450;is up to you.
299;00:18:43,950;00:18:44,950;Come, Samwell.
300;00:18:48,830;00:18:51,700;Should we send word
300;00:18:48,830;00:18:51,700;to your family, Ser...?
301;00:18:53,320;00:18:54,320;Jorah.
302;00:18:56,160;00:18:58,660;Jorah Mormont.
303;00:18:58,660;00:19:00,700;Mormont?
304;00:19:00,700;00:19:02,450;There's no need.
305;00:19:02,450;00:19:05,030;I've been dead
305;00:19:02,450;00:19:05,030;to them for years.
306;00:19:06,700;00:19:08,370;Ebrose:
306;00:19:06,700;00:19:08,370;Come, Samwell!
307;00:19:21,320;00:19:24,240;Qyburn:
307;00:19:21,320;00:19:24,240;Have you ever been
307;00:19:21,320;00:19:24,240;down here, Your Grace?
308;00:19:24,240;00:19:25,740;No, I can't say I have.
309;00:19:27,990;00:19:31,450;I haven't seen these
309;00:19:27,990;00:19:31,450;since Robert had them
309;00:19:27,990;00:19:31,450;removed from the throne room.
310;00:19:31,450;00:19:35,410;Curious that King Robert
310;00:19:31,450;00:19:35,410;did not have them destroyed.
311;00:19:35,410;00:19:37,570;They were his trophies.
312;00:19:37,580;00:19:38,780;He couldn't keep them around.
313;00:19:38,780;00:19:40,700;They would have
313;00:19:38,780;00:19:40,700;made him look small.
314;00:19:40,700;00:19:44,240;Sometimes
314;00:19:40,700;00:19:44,240;he would come down here
314;00:19:40,700;00:19:44,240;and look at them.
315;00:19:46,700;00:19:49,410;I believe he brought
315;00:19:46,700;00:19:49,410;his whores on occasion.
316;00:19:56,740;00:19:58,530;Balerion the Dread.
317;00:20:00,370;00:20:02,950;The beast that Aegon
317;00:20:00,370;00:20:02,950;rode across the sea.
318;00:20:02,950;00:20:05,870;His flames forged
318;00:20:02,950;00:20:05,870;the Iron Throne
319;00:20:05,870;00:20:08,740;and brought
319;00:20:05,870;00:20:08,740;the Seven Kingdoms
319;00:20:05,870;00:20:08,740;to heel.
320;00:20:09,910;00:20:11,070;Powerful...
321;00:20:12,200;00:20:13,620;but not invincible.
322;00:20:18,070;00:20:21,410;Apparently,
322;00:20:18,070;00:20:21,410;one of Daenerys's dragons
323;00:20:21,410;00:20:25,070;was wounded by spears
323;00:20:21,410;00:20:25,070;in the fighting pits
323;00:20:21,410;00:20:25,070;of Meereen.
324;00:20:26,580;00:20:28,910;And if they can be wounded,
325;00:20:28,910;00:20:30,280;they can be killed.
326;00:20:32,580;00:20:35,570;The finest artillators
326;00:20:32,580;00:20:35,570;and blacksmiths in
326;00:20:32,580;00:20:35,570;King's Landing
327;00:20:35,580;00:20:38,410;have been laboring
327;00:20:35,580;00:20:38,410;day and night,
327;00:20:35,580;00:20:38,410;Your Grace.
328;00:20:44,950;00:20:47,450;If you'll kindly
328;00:20:44,950;00:20:47,450;pull that lever.
329;00:21:03,910;00:21:06,450;Yara:
329;00:21:03,910;00:21:06,450;If you want
329;00:21:03,910;00:21:06,450;the Iron Throne, take it.
330;00:21:08,530;00:21:11,620;We have an army, a fleet,
330;00:21:08,530;00:21:11,620;and three dragons.
331;00:21:11,620;00:21:15,280;We should hit
331;00:21:11,620;00:21:15,280;King's Landing now, hard,
331;00:21:11,620;00:21:15,280;with everything we have.
332;00:21:15,280;00:21:17,780;The city will fall within a day.
333;00:21:17,780;00:21:20,700;If we turn the dragons loose,
333;00:21:17,780;00:21:20,700;tens of thousands will die
333;00:21:17,780;00:21:20,700;in the firestorms.
334;00:21:20,700;00:21:22,280;It's called war.
335;00:21:22,280;00:21:25,280;You don't have
335;00:21:22,280;00:21:25,280;the stomach for it,
335;00:21:22,280;00:21:25,280;scurry back into hiding.
336;00:21:25,280;00:21:26,620;I know how you wage war.
337;00:21:26,620;00:21:29,370;We don't poison
337;00:21:26,620;00:21:29,370;little girls here.
338;00:21:29,370;00:21:30,660;Myrcella was innocent.
339;00:21:30,660;00:21:32,030;She was a Lannister.
340;00:21:32,030;00:21:34,660;There are no
340;00:21:32,030;00:21:34,660;innocent Lannisters.
341;00:21:34,660;00:21:37,950;My greatest regret
341;00:21:34,660;00:21:37,950;is that Oberyn died
341;00:21:34,660;00:21:37,950;fighting for you.
342;00:21:37,950;00:21:39,820;Daenerys:
342;00:21:37,950;00:21:39,820;That's enough.
343;00:21:39,830;00:21:41,410;Lord Tyrion
343;00:21:39,830;00:21:41,410;is Hand of the Queen.
344;00:21:41,410;00:21:42,830;You will treat him with respect.
345;00:21:46,780;00:21:49,830;I am not here to be
345;00:21:46,780;00:21:49,830;queen of the ashes.
346;00:21:51,070;00:21:53,240;That's very nice to hear.
347;00:21:53,240;00:21:55,200;Of course,
347;00:21:53,240;00:21:55,200;I can't remember a queen
348;00:21:55,200;00:21:58,160;who was better loved
348;00:21:55,200;00:21:58,160;than my granddaughter.
349;00:21:58,160;00:22:00,120;The common people loved her.
350;00:22:00,120;00:22:01,870;The nobles loved her.
351;00:22:01,870;00:22:03,620;And what is left of her now?
352;00:22:03,620;00:22:06,450;Ashes.
353;00:22:06,450;00:22:08,160;Commoners, nobles,
354;00:22:08,160;00:22:10,030;they're all
354;00:22:08,160;00:22:10,030;just children, really.
355;00:22:10,030;00:22:13,660;They won't obey you
355;00:22:10,030;00:22:13,660;unless they fear you.
356;00:22:15,660;00:22:17,910;I'm grateful
356;00:22:15,660;00:22:17,910;to you, Lady Olenna,
356;00:22:15,660;00:22:17,910;for your counsel.
357;00:22:17,910;00:22:19,820;I'm grateful to all of you.
358;00:22:19,830;00:22:22,450;But you have chosen
358;00:22:19,830;00:22:22,450;to follow me.
359;00:22:22,450;00:22:24,820;I will not attack
359;00:22:22,450;00:22:24,820;King's Landing.
360;00:22:24,830;00:22:27,660;We will not attack
360;00:22:24,830;00:22:27,660;King's Landing.
361;00:22:27,660;00:22:31,320;Then how do you mean
361;00:22:27,660;00:22:31,320;to take the Iron Throne?
362;00:22:31,320;00:22:32,660;By asking nicely?
363;00:22:34,780;00:22:36,200;We will lay siege
363;00:22:34,780;00:22:36,200;to the capital,
364;00:22:36,200;00:22:37,910;surrounding the city
364;00:22:36,200;00:22:37,910;on all sides.
365;00:22:37,910;00:22:39,700;Cersei will have
365;00:22:37,910;00:22:39,700;the Iron Throne,
366;00:22:39,700;00:22:42,070;but no food for her army
366;00:22:39,700;00:22:42,070;or the people.
367;00:22:42,070;00:22:44,990;But we won't use
367;00:22:42,070;00:22:44,990;Dothraki and Unsullied.
368;00:22:44,990;00:22:47,030;Cersei will try to rally
368;00:22:44,990;00:22:47,030;the lords of Westeros
369;00:22:47,030;00:22:48,700;by appealing to their loyalty,
370;00:22:48,700;00:22:50,370;their love for their country.
371;00:22:50,370;00:22:52,280;If we besiege the city
371;00:22:50,370;00:22:52,280;with foreigners,
372;00:22:52,280;00:22:53,990;we prove her point.
373;00:22:53,990;00:22:55,620;Our army should be Westerosi.
374;00:22:55,620;00:22:57,910;And I suppose
374;00:22:55,620;00:22:57,910;we're providing
374;00:22:55,620;00:22:57,910;the Westerosi?
375;00:22:57,910;00:22:59,200;You are.
376;00:22:59,200;00:23:02,580;Lady Greyjoy
376;00:22:59,200;00:23:02,580;will escort you home
376;00:22:59,200;00:23:02,580;to Sunspear.
377;00:23:05,490;00:23:08,570;And her Iron Fleet
377;00:23:05,490;00:23:08,570;will ferry the Dornish army
378;00:23:08,580;00:23:10,570;back up to King's Landing.
379;00:23:10,580;00:23:13,410;The Dornish
379;00:23:10,580;00:23:13,410;will lay siege
379;00:23:10,580;00:23:13,410;to the capital
380;00:23:13,410;00:23:15,450;alongside the Tyrell army.
381;00:23:15,450;00:23:18,120;Two great kingdoms
381;00:23:15,450;00:23:18,120;united against Cersei.
382;00:23:18,120;00:23:23,240;So, your master plan
382;00:23:18,120;00:23:23,240;is to use our armies.
383;00:23:23,240;00:23:26,620;Forgive me for asking,
383;00:23:23,240;00:23:26,620;but why did you bother
383;00:23:23,240;00:23:26,620;to bring your own?
384;00:23:28,070;00:23:31,120;The Unsullied will have
384;00:23:28,070;00:23:31,120;another objective.
385;00:23:31,120;00:23:34,700;For decades,
385;00:23:31,120;00:23:34,700;House Lannister has been
385;00:23:31,120;00:23:34,700;the true power in Westeros.
386;00:23:34,700;00:23:38,870;And the seat of that power
386;00:23:34,700;00:23:38,870;is Casterly Rock.
387;00:23:38,870;00:23:40,780;Grey Worm and the Unsullied
388;00:23:40,780;00:23:43,660;will sail for the Rock
388;00:23:40,780;00:23:43,660;and take it.
389;00:24:02,200;00:24:03,830;Do I have your support?
390;00:24:05,620;00:24:06,990;You have mine.
391;00:24:08,780;00:24:10,660;Dorne is with you, Your Grace.
392;00:24:14,870;00:24:16,320;Thank you all.
393;00:24:18,030;00:24:19,660;Lady Olenna, may I speak
393;00:24:18,030;00:24:19,660;with you alone?
394;00:24:28,620;00:24:33,030;I realize you're here
394;00:24:28,620;00:24:33,030;out of hatred for Cersei
394;00:24:28,620;00:24:33,030;and not love for me.
395;00:24:33,030;00:24:36,950;But I swear to you,
395;00:24:33,030;00:24:36,950;she will pay for
395;00:24:33,030;00:24:36,950;what she's done.
396;00:24:36,950;00:24:39,620;And we will bring peace
396;00:24:36,950;00:24:39,620;back to Westeros.
397;00:24:39,620;00:24:41,660;Peace?
398;00:24:41,660;00:24:44,320;Do you think
398;00:24:41,660;00:24:44,320;that's what we had
398;00:24:41,660;00:24:44,320;under your father?
399;00:24:44,320;00:24:47,450;Or his father?
399;00:24:44,320;00:24:47,450;Or his?
400;00:24:47,450;00:24:50,120;Peace never lasts, my dear.
401;00:24:50,120;00:24:52,450;Will you take
401;00:24:50,120;00:24:52,450;a bit of advice
401;00:24:50,120;00:24:52,450;from an old woman?
402;00:24:54,490;00:24:56,450;He's a clever man, your Hand.
403;00:24:56,450;00:25:00,280;I've known
403;00:24:56,450;00:25:00,280;a great many clever men.
404;00:25:00,280;00:25:02,200;I've outlived them all.
405;00:25:02,200;00:25:04,120;You know why?
406;00:25:04,120;00:25:05,660;I ignored them.
407;00:25:05,660;00:25:09,160;The lords of Westeros are sheep.
408;00:25:09,160;00:25:10,530;Are you a sheep?
409;00:25:12,240;00:25:13,870;No.
410;00:25:13,870;00:25:16,160;You're a dragon.
411;00:25:16,160;00:25:17,700;Be a dragon.
412;00:25:21,280;00:25:24,030;Grey Worm: Mají.
413;00:25:28,740;00:25:30,160;You leave tomorrow.
414;00:25:32,990;00:25:35,410;Were you going to say goodbye?
415;00:25:35,410;00:25:38,030;I will see you when I return.
416;00:25:38,030;00:25:39,910;But you don't know
416;00:25:38,030;00:25:39,910;when that will be.
417;00:25:41,910;00:25:42,780;No one knows.
418;00:25:45,740;00:25:47,740;I wish you good fortune.
419;00:25:50,240;00:25:51,280;Missandei.
420;00:25:59,780;00:26:02,240;It is hard for me
420;00:25:59,780;00:26:02,240;to say goodbye to you.
421;00:26:02,240;00:26:03,450;Why?
422;00:26:03,450;00:26:05,120;You know why.
423;00:26:05,120;00:26:06,200;I don't.
424;00:26:09,450;00:26:12,870;Y-you are my weakness.
425;00:26:14,200;00:26:16,320;That's what I am?
426;00:26:16,320;00:26:17,780;Your weakness?
427;00:26:17,780;00:26:21,490;When Unsullied are young,
427;00:26:17,780;00:26:21,490;the masters learn their fears.
428;00:26:22,910;00:26:25,450;One boy is scared of dogs,
429;00:26:25,450;00:26:27,320;one boy hates high places,
430;00:26:27,320;00:26:30,160;one is frightened of the ocean.
431;00:26:30,160;00:26:32,620;They make the boy
431;00:26:30,160;00:26:32,620;sleep with dogs
432;00:26:32,620;00:26:34,530;or climb a cliff.
433;00:26:34,530;00:26:36,820;They throw him in the water.
434;00:26:36,830;00:26:39,120;If he learns to swim, good.
435;00:26:39,120;00:26:41,070;If he drowns, good.
436;00:26:42,280;00:26:45,280;Either way, strong Unsullied.
437;00:26:45,280;00:26:47,700;But I had no fears.
438;00:26:47,700;00:26:51,490;I was never the biggest,
438;00:26:47,700;00:26:51,490;never the strongest...
439;00:26:53,070;00:26:56,160;but I was bravest, always.
440;00:26:57,620;00:26:59,570;I believe it.
440;00:26:57,620;00:26:59,570;Until...
441;00:26:59,580;00:27:03,370;I meet Missandei
441;00:26:59,580;00:27:03,370;from the Isle of Naath.
442;00:27:04,910;00:27:08,160;Now I have fear.
443;00:27:13,780;00:27:14,990;I do, too.
444;00:28:30,780;00:28:32,200;No.
445;00:28:33,740;00:28:35,410;I want to see you.
446;00:28:36,780;00:28:38,120;Please.
447;00:30:10,950;00:30:12,120;Might be useful.
448;00:30:12,120;00:30:13,990;Ch'Vyalthan was
448;00:30:12,120;00:30:13,990;a dreadful writer,
449;00:30:13,990;00:30:15,820;but an excellent researcher.
450;00:30:15,830;00:30:18,280;Archmaester,
450;00:30:15,830;00:30:18,280;I wondered if I...
450;00:30:15,830;00:30:18,280;And this one.
451;00:30:18,280;00:30:20,160;Maester Faull was
451;00:30:18,280;00:30:20,160;quite the opposite...
452;00:30:20,160;00:30:22,910;A brilliant stylist who
452;00:30:20,160;00:30:22,910;invented half the stories
452;00:30:20,160;00:30:22,910;he tells.
453;00:30:22,910;00:30:24,530;Um, I wanted
453;00:30:22,910;00:30:24,530;to ask you...
454;00:30:24,530;00:30:26,320;If you're going
454;00:30:24,530;00:30:26,320;to write histories, Tarly,
455;00:30:26,320;00:30:27,910;you have to do the research.
456;00:30:27,910;00:30:29,780;If you want people
456;00:30:27,910;00:30:29,780;to read your histories,
457;00:30:29,780;00:30:32,030;you need a bit of style.
458;00:30:32,030;00:30:34,030;I'm not writing
458;00:30:32,030;00:30:34,030;A Chronicle of the Wars.
459;00:30:34,030;00:30:35,870;Following the Death
459;00:30:34,030;00:30:35,870;of King Robert I
460;00:30:35,870;00:30:38,160;so it can sit on a shelf unread.
461;00:30:40,490;00:30:42,990;What?
461;00:30:40,490;00:30:42,990;You don't
461;00:30:40,490;00:30:42,990;like the title?
462;00:30:44,200;00:30:45,530;What would you call it, then?
463;00:30:45,530;00:30:48,870;Mm, possibly something
463;00:30:45,530;00:30:48,870;a bit more poetic?
464;00:30:48,870;00:30:51,620;We're not poets, Tarly.
465;00:30:51,620;00:30:53,780;Um, Archmaester,
465;00:30:51,620;00:30:53,780;if I could just
465;00:30:51,620;00:30:53,780;have a moment.
466;00:30:53,780;00:30:55,530;This is your moment.
467;00:30:55,530;00:30:56,990;Use it wisely.
468;00:30:58,910;00:31:00,990;I may have found a way
468;00:30:58,910;00:31:00,990;to treat Ser Jorah.
469;00:31:02,620;00:31:04,370;There are two recorded cases
470;00:31:04,370;00:31:06,200;of advanced greyscale

471;00:31:06,200;00:31:08,030;I found the procedure
471;00:31:06,200;00:31:08,030;in the study of rare diseases
472;00:31:08,030;00:31:09,370;by Archmaester Pylos.
473;00:31:09,370;00:31:11,530;I'm familiar with
473;00:31:09,370;00:31:11,530;Archmaester Pylos
474;00:31:11,530;00:31:13,490;and his study of rare diseases.
475;00:31:13,490;00:31:15,490;Oh, you are?
475;00:31:13,490;00:31:15,490;Yes.
476;00:31:15,490;00:31:17,410;And shall I tell you
476;00:31:15,490;00:31:17,410;how he died?
477;00:31:18,580;00:31:19,910;From greyscale.
478;00:31:21,700;00:31:23,570;Oh.
478;00:31:21,700;00:31:23,570;The procedure's
478;00:31:21,700;00:31:23,570;far too dangerous,
479;00:31:23,580;00:31:24,740;which is why it's now forbidden.
480;00:32:09,160;00:32:10,570;Hello.
481;00:32:10,580;00:32:13,120;What are you doing?
482;00:32:14,490;00:32:16,660;You're Jorah Mormont,

484;00:32:19,950;00:32:21,740;My name is Samwell Tarly,

486;00:32:23,530;00:32:26,320;as maester at Castle Black.
487;00:32:26,320;00:32:27,620;I knew your father.
488;00:32:27,620;00:32:29,120;I was with him when he died.
489;00:32:35,200;00:32:37,320;You are not
489;00:32:35,200;00:32:37,320;dying today,
489;00:32:35,200;00:32:37,320;Ser Jorah.
490;00:32:43,320;00:32:44,950;Drink this.
491;00:32:44,950;00:32:46,740;What is it?
491;00:32:44,950;00:32:46,740;Rum.
492;00:32:46,740;00:32:48,660;Drink it all, please.
492;00:32:46,740;00:32:48,660;I'm afraid this is
492;00:32:46,740;00:32:48,660;going to hurt.
493;00:33:09,320;00:33:11,990;If you could
493;00:33:09,320;00:33:11,990;take off your shirt.
494;00:33:25,780;00:33:28,870;If you wouldn't mind,
494;00:33:25,780;00:33:28,870;bite down hard.
495;00:33:30,370;00:33:32,320;I'm sorry, but no one
495;00:33:30,370;00:33:32,320;knows I'm here,
496;00:33:32,320;00:33:34,370;and if they
496;00:33:32,320;00:33:34,370;hear you screaming,
496;00:33:32,320;00:33:34,370;then we're both finished.
497;00:33:38,410;00:33:40,030;Jorah:
497;00:33:38,410;00:33:40,030;Have you ever
497;00:33:38,410;00:33:40,030;done this before?
498;00:33:47,490;00:33:48,370;No.
499;00:33:50,120;00:33:52,740;But no one else will try it,
499;00:33:50,120;00:33:52,740;so I'm the best you've got.
500;00:33:56,240;00:33:57,700;Have a seat.
501;00:34:01,910;00:34:04,620;I'm going to have to remove
501;00:34:01,910;00:34:04,620;the entire upper layer
501;00:34:01,910;00:34:04,620;of infected tissue,
502;00:34:04,620;00:34:06,910;then apply a medicinal
502;00:34:04,620;00:34:06,910;ointment to the...
503;00:34:19,240;00:34:22,740;Shh, shh!
504;00:34:22,740;00:34:24,990;Shh.
505;00:34:24,990;00:34:27,410;Again, I'm sorry,
506;00:34:27,410;00:34:29,910;but please try not to scream.
507;00:35:28,620;00:35:31,240;They say her dragons
507;00:35:28,620;00:35:31,240;are bigger than Aegon's.
508;00:35:31,240;00:35:33,990;Horseshit.
508;00:35:31,240;00:35:33,990;Cersei's just trying
508;00:35:31,240;00:35:33,990;to frighten us.
509;00:35:33,990;00:35:35,570;I hope it's true.
510;00:35:35,580;00:35:38,620;If she lays siege
510;00:35:35,580;00:35:38,620;to King's Landing,
510;00:35:35,580;00:35:38,620;prices will triple.
511;00:35:38,620;00:35:41,990;As long
511;00:35:38,620;00:35:41,990;as we get back there
511;00:35:38,620;00:35:41,990;before they start.
512;00:35:41,990;00:35:44,530;One more round.
512;00:35:41,990;00:35:44,530;It's a long ride.
513;00:35:45,660;00:35:47,990;Hot Pie:
513;00:35:45,660;00:35:47,990;Arry!
514;00:35:47,990;00:35:49,200;Hello, Hot Pie.
515;00:35:50,490;00:35:51,530;Sit down.
516;00:35:53,950;00:35:55,200;Who's that for?
517;00:36:03,990;00:36:05,700;Mm. This is good.
518;00:36:07,700;00:36:09,160;You think so?
519;00:36:09,160;00:36:11,910;The secret
519;00:36:09,160;00:36:11,910;is browning the butter
519;00:36:09,160;00:36:11,910;before making the dough.
520;00:36:11,910;00:36:14,870;Most people don't do that
520;00:36:11,910;00:36:14,870;'cause it takes up
520;00:36:11,910;00:36:14,870;too much time.
521;00:36:14,870;00:36:16,490;Mm, I didn't do that.
522;00:36:16,490;00:36:18,030;You've been making pies?
523;00:36:18,030;00:36:20,370;One or two.
524;00:36:20,370;00:36:22,370;I can't believe you're here.
525;00:36:22,370;00:36:24,820;Did you meet the big lady?
526;00:36:24,830;00:36:27,820;Big lady?
526;00:36:24,830;00:36:27,820;The lady knight?
527;00:36:27,830;00:36:30,030;You know,
527;00:36:27,830;00:36:30,030;I figured she was a knight
527;00:36:27,830;00:36:30,030;'cause she had armor on.
528;00:36:30,030;00:36:33,870;She was looking
528;00:36:30,030;00:36:33,870;for your sister,
528;00:36:30,030;00:36:33,870;but I told her about you.
529;00:36:33,870;00:36:35,370;Did she ever find you?
530;00:36:36,950;00:36:38,320;She found me.
531;00:36:43,620;00:36:44,870;What happened to you, Arry?
532;00:36:55,370;00:36:56,370;You got any ale?
533;00:37:11,740;00:37:13,910;Where you heading?
533;00:37:11,740;00:37:13,910;King's Landing.
534;00:37:13,910;00:37:16,410;Why?
534;00:37:13,910;00:37:16,410;Heard Cersei's
534;00:37:13,910;00:37:16,410;queen now.
535;00:37:16,410;00:37:17,990;Heard she blew up
535;00:37:16,410;00:37:17,990;the Great Sept.
536;00:37:17,990;00:37:19,570;That must have been
536;00:37:17,990;00:37:19,570;something to see.
537;00:37:19,580;00:37:21,370;Boom.
537;00:37:19,580;00:37:21,370;Mm.
538;00:37:21,370;00:37:23,570;I can't believe
538;00:37:21,370;00:37:23,570;someone would do that.
539;00:37:23,580;00:37:25,120;Cersei would do that.
540;00:37:27,280;00:37:30,320;I thought you'd be
540;00:37:27,280;00:37:30,320;heading for Winterfell.
541;00:37:30,320;00:37:32,450;Why would I go there?
541;00:37:30,320;00:37:32,450;The Boltons have it.
542;00:37:32,450;00:37:34,910;No, the Boltons are dead.
543;00:37:36,320;00:37:38,280;What?
544;00:37:38,280;00:37:40,450;Jon Snow came down
544;00:37:38,280;00:37:40,450;from Castle Black
544;00:37:38,280;00:37:40,450;with a wildling army
545;00:37:40,450;00:37:42,240;and won the Battle
545;00:37:40,450;00:37:42,240;of the Bastards.
546;00:37:42,240;00:37:43,660;He's King of the North now.
547;00:37:45,370;00:37:46,450;You're lying.
548;00:37:46,450;00:37:48,320;Why would I lie about that?
549;00:37:48,320;00:37:49,780;He's your brother, right?
550;00:37:56,700;00:37:59,120;Thanks for the pie.
551;00:37:59,120;00:38:01,030;Friends don't pay.
552;00:38:01,030;00:38:03,320;Can't believe
552;00:38:01,030;00:38:03,320;I thought you were a boy.
553;00:38:03,320;00:38:05,240;You're pretty.
554;00:38:06,450;00:38:07,450;Thanks.
555;00:38:13,370;00:38:14,870;Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.
556;00:38:15,990;00:38:17,660;Try not to get killed.
557;00:38:17,660;00:38:19,070;Ah, I won't.
558;00:38:19,070;00:38:20,320;I'm like you, Arry.
559;00:38:20,320;00:38:21,990;I'm a survivor.
560;00:38:26,240;00:38:28,320;200 miles to King's Landing.
561;00:38:29,870;00:38:31,990;One bottle of rum.
561;00:38:29,870;00:38:31,990;You think we'll make it?
562;00:39:06,070;00:39:07,740;Come in.
563;00:39:07,740;00:39:11,200;A raven, my king,
563;00:39:07,740;00:39:11,200;from the Citadel.
564;00:39:21,370;00:39:23,740;Jon:
564;00:39:21,370;00:39:23,740;This message was sent
564;00:39:21,370;00:39:23,740;to me by Samwell Tarly.
565;00:39:23,740;00:39:27,070;He was my brother
565;00:39:23,740;00:39:27,070;at the Night's Watch,
566;00:39:27,070;00:39:31,620;a man I trust as much
566;00:39:27,070;00:39:31,620;as anyone in this world.
567;00:39:31,620;00:39:34,410;He's discovered proof
567;00:39:31,620;00:39:34,410;that Dragonstone
568;00:39:34,410;00:39:37,240;sits on a mountain
568;00:39:34,410;00:39:37,240;of dragonglass.
569;00:39:41,410;00:39:45,570;I received this a few days ago
570;00:39:45,580;00:39:47,200;from Dragonstone.
571;00:39:48,870;00:39:51,200;It was sent to me
571;00:39:48,870;00:39:51,200;by Tyrion Lannister.
572;00:39:53,240;00:39:56,570;He is now
572;00:39:53,240;00:39:56,570;Hand of the Queen
572;00:39:53,240;00:39:56,570;to Daenerys Targaryen.
573;00:39:56,580;00:40:00,620;She intends to
573;00:39:56,580;00:40:00,620;take the Iron Throne
573;00:39:56,580;00:40:00,620;from Cersei Lannister.
574;00:40:00,620;00:40:02,530;She has a powerful army
574;00:40:00,620;00:40:02,530;at her back
575;00:40:02,530;00:40:06,410;and, if this message
575;00:40:02,530;00:40:06,410;is to be believed,
576;00:40:06,410;00:40:07,700;three dragons.
577;00:40:09,700;00:40:12,450;Jon: Lord Tyrion
577;00:40:09,700;00:40:12,450;has invited me
577;00:40:09,700;00:40:12,450;to Dragonstone
578;00:40:12,450;00:40:14,200;to meet with Daenerys.
579;00:40:15,530;00:40:16,950;And I'm going to accept.
580;00:40:16,950;00:40:18,280;Man: Accept?!
581;00:40:20,950;00:40:24,740;We need
581;00:40:20,950;00:40:24,740;this dragonglass,
581;00:40:20,950;00:40:24,740;my lords!
582;00:40:24,740;00:40:26,700;We know
582;00:40:24,740;00:40:26,700;that dragonglass
582;00:40:24,740;00:40:26,700;can destroy
583;00:40:26,700;00:40:28,620;both white walkers
583;00:40:26,700;00:40:28,620;and their army.
584;00:40:28,620;00:40:32,160;We need to mine it
584;00:40:28,620;00:40:32,160;and turn it into weapons.
585;00:40:33,620;00:40:35,530;But more importantly,
585;00:40:33,620;00:40:35,530;we need allies!
586;00:40:35,530;00:40:39,820;The Night King's army
586;00:40:35,530;00:40:39,820;grows larger by the day.
587;00:40:39,830;00:40:41,570;We can't defeat them on our own.
588;00:40:41,580;00:40:43,410;We don't have the numbers.
589;00:40:43,410;00:40:47,120;Daenerys has her own army
589;00:40:43,410;00:40:47,120;and she has dragonfire.
590;00:40:47,120;00:40:50,410;I need to try
590;00:40:47,120;00:40:50,410;and persuade her
590;00:40:47,120;00:40:50,410;to fight with us.
591;00:40:50,410;00:40:53,530;Ser Davos and I will ride
591;00:40:50,410;00:40:53,530;for White Harbor tomorrow,
592;00:40:53,530;00:40:55,950;then sail for Dragonstone.
593;00:40:55,950;00:40:58,870;Have you forgotten
593;00:40:55,950;00:40:58,870;what happened to
593;00:40:55,950;00:40:58,870;our grandfather?
594;00:40:58,870;00:41:01,070;The Mad King invited him
594;00:40:58,870;00:41:01,070;to King's Landing
595;00:41:01,070;00:41:03,370;and roasted him alive.
595;00:41:01,070;00:41:03,370;I know that.
596;00:41:03,370;00:41:06,490;She is here to
596;00:41:03,370;00:41:06,490;reclaim the Iron Throne
596;00:41:03,370;00:41:06,490;and the Seven Kingdoms.
597;00:41:06,490;00:41:08,490;The North is one
597;00:41:06,490;00:41:08,490;of those seven kingdoms.
598;00:41:08,490;00:41:11,320;"This isn't an invitation;"
598;00:41:08,490;00:41:11,320;it's a trap.
599;00:41:11,320;00:41:14,620;It could be,
599;00:41:11,320;00:41:14,620;but I don't believe
599;00:41:11,320;00:41:14,620;Tyrion would do that.
600;00:41:14,620;00:41:16,990;You know him.
600;00:41:14,620;00:41:16,990;He's a good man.
601;00:41:16,990;00:41:20,820;Your Grace, with respect,
601;00:41:16,990;00:41:20,820;I must agree with Lady Sansa.
602;00:41:20,830;00:41:23,910;I remember the Mad King
602;00:41:20,830;00:41:23,910;all too well.
603;00:41:23,910;00:41:26,660;A Targaryen cannot be trusted.
604;00:41:26,660;00:41:28,870;Nor can a Lannister.
604;00:41:26,660;00:41:28,870;All: Yeah!
605;00:41:28,870;00:41:32,320;Aye. We called
605;00:41:28,870;00:41:32,320;your brother king.
606;00:41:32,320;00:41:36,240;And then he rode south
606;00:41:32,320;00:41:36,240;and lost his kingdom.
607;00:41:36,240;00:41:40,030;Winter is here, Your Grace.
608;00:41:40,030;00:41:42,910;We need
608;00:41:40,030;00:41:42,910;the King in the North
608;00:41:40,030;00:41:42,910;in the North.
609;00:41:42,910;00:41:46,240;Men: Aye!
610;00:41:54,660;00:41:56,990;You all crowned me your king.
611;00:41:58,870;00:42:01,200;I never wanted it.
612;00:42:01,200;00:42:03,660;I never asked for it.
613;00:42:03,660;00:42:07,950;But I accepted it
613;00:42:03,660;00:42:07,950;because the North
613;00:42:03,660;00:42:07,950;is my home.
614;00:42:07,950;00:42:12,240;It's part of me,
614;00:42:07,950;00:42:12,240;and I will never
614;00:42:07,950;00:42:12,240;stop fighting for it,
615;00:42:12,240;00:42:13,660;no matter the odds.
616;00:42:16,370;00:42:18,320;But the odds are against us.
617;00:42:21,490;00:42:24,530;None of you have seen
617;00:42:21,490;00:42:24,530;the Army of the Dead.
617;00:42:21,490;00:42:24,530;None of you.
618;00:42:24,530;00:42:28,570;We can never hope
618;00:42:24,530;00:42:28,570;to defeat them alone.
619;00:42:28,580;00:42:31,580;We need allies, powerful allies.
620;00:42:34,410;00:42:36,410;I know it's a risk.
621;00:42:38,200;00:42:39,620;But I have to take it.
622;00:42:39,620;00:42:42,370;Then send an emissary.
622;00:42:39,620;00:42:42,370;Don't go yourself.
623;00:42:42,370;00:42:43,910;Daenerys is a queen.
624;00:42:43,910;00:42:46,240;Only a king can
624;00:42:43,910;00:42:46,240;convince her to help us.
625;00:42:46,240;00:42:48,030;It has to be me.
626;00:42:48,030;00:42:49,990;You're abandoning your people!
627;00:42:49,990;00:42:51,780;You're abandoning your home.
628;00:42:51,780;00:42:53,700;I'm leaving both in good hands.
629;00:42:53,700;00:42:55,120;Whose?
629;00:42:53,700;00:42:55,120;Yours.
630;00:42:57,160;00:42:58,620;You are my sister.
631;00:42:58,620;00:43:00,700;You're the only Stark
631;00:42:58,620;00:43:00,700;in Winterfell.
632;00:43:00,700;00:43:04,620;Until I return,
632;00:43:00,700;00:43:04,620;the North is yours.
633;00:43:27,830;00:43:29,740;Littlefinger:
633;00:43:27,830;00:43:29,740;I delivered his bones myself.
634;00:43:31,280;00:43:32,910;Presented them to Lady Catelyn
635;00:43:32,910;00:43:35,410;as a gesture of goodwill
635;00:43:32,910;00:43:35,410;from Tyrion Lannister.
636;00:43:36,740;00:43:38,240;Seems like a lifetime ago.
637;00:43:39,950;00:43:42,580;Do give Lord Tyrion my best
637;00:43:39,950;00:43:42,580;when you see him.
638;00:43:45,990;00:43:47,950;I was sorry when he died.
639;00:43:47,950;00:43:51,660;Your father and I
639;00:43:47,950;00:43:51,660;had our differences,
639;00:43:47,950;00:43:51,660;but he loved Cat very much.
640;00:43:54,320;00:43:55,870;So did I.
641;00:43:58,160;00:44:00,320;She wasn't fond of you, was she?
642;00:44:02,240;00:44:05,280;Well, it appears she vastly
642;00:44:02,240;00:44:05,280;underestimated you.
643;00:44:07,410;00:44:08,740;Your father
643;00:44:07,410;00:44:08,740;and brothers are gone,
644;00:44:08,740;00:44:10,780;yet here you stand,
644;00:44:08,740;00:44:10,780;King in the North.
645;00:44:12,160;00:44:14,490;Last best hope
645;00:44:12,160;00:44:14,490;against the coming storm.
646;00:44:19,620;00:44:21,660;You don't belong down here.
647;00:44:23,030;00:44:24,450;Forgive me.
648;00:44:26,240;00:44:29,700;We haven't ever
648;00:44:26,240;00:44:29,700;talked... properly.
649;00:44:29,700;00:44:31,200;I wanted to remedy that.
650;00:44:32,530;00:44:34,370;I have nothing to say to you.
651;00:44:36,120;00:44:38,450;Not even thank you?
652;00:44:38,450;00:44:42,700;If it weren't for me,
652;00:44:38,450;00:44:42,700;you'd have been slaughtered
652;00:44:38,450;00:44:42,700;on that battlefield.
653;00:44:42,700;00:44:46,070;You have many enemies,
653;00:44:42,700;00:44:46,070;my king, but I swear to you,
653;00:44:42,700;00:44:46,070;I'm not one of them.
654;00:44:48,660;00:44:50,740;I love Sansa,
655;00:44:50,740;00:44:52,410;as I loved her mother.
656;00:45:02,700;00:45:06,240;Touch my sister,
656;00:45:02,700;00:45:06,240;and I'll kill you myself.
657;00:45:32,120;00:45:33,870;Man: Ready?
657;00:45:32,120;00:45:33,870;Man #2: Ready?
658;00:45:37,530;00:45:38,910;Man #2:
658;00:45:37,530;00:45:38,910;Ready!
659;00:45:42,410;00:45:43,530;Come on.
660;00:45:47,030;00:45:49,280;Man: Yah!
660;00:45:47,030;00:45:49,280;Man #2: Come on!
661;00:47:38,580;00:47:40,200;Nymeria?
662;00:47:54,580;00:47:57,910;Nymeria, it's me, Arya.
663;00:48:02,990;00:48:05,240;I'm heading north, girl.
664;00:48:07,740;00:48:10,280;Back to Winterfell.
664;00:48:07,740;00:48:10,280;I'm finally going home.
665;00:48:13,830;00:48:15,070;Come with me.
666;00:48:25,280;00:48:26,700;Come with me.
667;00:48:54,830;00:48:56,450;That's not you.
668;00:49:12,320;00:49:15,280;Nym:
668;00:49:12,320;00:49:15,280;You can't have them all.
668;00:49:12,320;00:49:15,280;It's not fair.
669;00:49:15,280;00:49:16,700;Obara:
669;00:49:15,280;00:49:16,700;I'm oldest.
670;00:49:16,700;00:49:18,820;Mama will want Cersei
670;00:49:16,700;00:49:18,820;for herself.
671;00:49:18,830;00:49:20,820;She's not my mama.
672;00:49:20,830;00:49:22,910;You can have Cersei.
673;00:49:22,910;00:49:25,450;I want the Mountain.
674;00:49:25,450;00:49:27,570;The Mountain killed Father.
675;00:49:27,580;00:49:29,320;He'll crush you with one hand.
676;00:49:29,320;00:49:32,070;Father got careless.
676;00:49:29,320;00:49:32,070;That's what Mama says.
677;00:49:32,070;00:49:34,280;Will you shut up about Mama?
678;00:49:34,280;00:49:35,870;Mama, Mama, Mama.
679;00:49:35,870;00:49:39,740;Maybe I'll kill you both
679;00:49:35,870;00:49:39,740;before we take King's Landing.
680;00:49:39,740;00:49:41,280;And then I won't have to share.
681;00:49:43,780;00:49:44,990;Both:
681;00:49:43,780;00:49:44,990;Mama!
682;00:49:47,030;00:49:48,990;How can you drink this piss?
683;00:49:48,990;00:49:51,120;When we reach Sunspear,
684;00:49:51,120;00:49:53,660;I'll treat you to a Dornish red.
685;00:49:53,660;00:49:56,070;The best in the world.
686;00:49:56,070;00:49:57,490;Have you ever been to Dorne?
687;00:49:57,490;00:49:59,490;A few times.
688;00:49:59,490;00:50:00,870;Never stayed long.
689;00:50:00,870;00:50:02,410;A boy in every port?
690;00:50:03,530;00:50:04,990;A boy, a girl.
691;00:50:06,530;00:50:07,910;Depends on the port.
692;00:50:11,580;00:50:13,740;Could we get some more?
693;00:50:15,030;00:50:16,910;I thought it wasn't for you.
694;00:50:16,910;00:50:19,200;I'm developing a taste for it.
695;00:50:20,740;00:50:22,990;He's not your servant.
695;00:50:20,740;00:50:22,990;It's fine.
696;00:50:24,950;00:50:29,700;So, you're going to be
696;00:50:24,950;00:50:29,700;Queen of the Iron Islands.
697;00:50:29,700;00:50:31,530;Once I kill my uncle.
698;00:50:31,530;00:50:33,990;And what will you be, handsome?
699;00:50:33,990;00:50:35,700;Whatever my queen commands.
700;00:50:35,700;00:50:39,530;He'll be my advisor,
700;00:50:35,700;00:50:39,530;my protector.
701;00:50:39,530;00:50:41,780;Oh, I see.
702;00:50:41,780;00:50:43,200;Your protector.
703;00:50:44,950;00:50:47,490;So, if someone gets
703;00:50:44,950;00:50:47,490;too close to you...
704;00:50:47,490;00:50:49,280;He might have to intervene.
705;00:50:49,280;00:50:51,070;To hold that person back.
706;00:50:51,070;00:50:53,740;Until they've made
706;00:50:51,070;00:50:53,740;their intentions known.
707;00:50:57,120;00:50:59,030;Why are you standing
707;00:50:57,120;00:50:59,030;all the way over there, then?
708;00:51:00,580;00:51:02,660;A foreign invasion is underway.
709;00:51:02,660;00:51:04,410;Leave him be.
710;00:51:07,660;00:51:09,780;Seems like you
710;00:51:07,660;00:51:09,780;don't need a protector.
711;00:51:15,580;00:51:16,700;Stay here.
712;00:51:19,700;00:51:22,660;Man: We're under attack!
713;00:51:44,950;00:51:46,410;Euron.
714;00:52:54,320;00:52:56,660;You mother's below deck.
714;00:52:54,320;00:52:56,660;Keep her safe.
715;00:53:48,580;00:53:50,240;Aah!
716;00:54:04,070;00:54:05,070;Yah!
717;00:54:10,830;00:54:11,740;Aah!
718;00:54:29,990;00:54:31,120;Yah!
719;00:54:32,780;00:54:33,660;Yah!
720;00:54:52,320;00:54:53,820;Kill us.
721;00:54:53,830;00:54:55,280;Get it over with.
722;00:55:20,030;00:55:21,490;Give your uncle a kiss.
723;00:55:58,280;00:56:00,240;Euron:
723;00:55:58,280;00:56:00,240;Little Theon!
724;00:56:14,320;00:56:17,240;Ah, come on,
724;00:56:14,320;00:56:17,240;you cockless coward.
725;00:56:20,910;00:56:22,990;I have her.
726;00:56:22,990;00:56:24,580;Come and get her.
727;00:59:18,870;00:59:21,410;I was born
727;00:59:18,870;00:59:21,410;to rule the Seven Kingdoms.
728;00:59:21,410;00:59:22,580;And I will.
729;00:59:22,950;00:59:24,830;♪
730;00:59:25,030;00:59:28,030;The war's already begun.
730;00:59:25,030;00:59:28,030;I've drawn first blood.
731;00:59:28,870;00:59:30,030;Cersei will be ready.
732;00:59:30,580;00:59:31,740;They know we're coming.
