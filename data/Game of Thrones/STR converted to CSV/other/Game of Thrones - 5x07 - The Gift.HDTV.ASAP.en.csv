1;00:00:02,555;00:00:04,268;Did you kill Joffrey?
2;00:00:04,798;00:00:07,352;It was something my new friends
2;00:00:04,798;00:00:07,352;wanted very badly.
3;00:00:07,632;00:00:10,374;You didn't think I'd let you marry
3;00:00:07,632;00:00:10,374;that beast, did you?
4;00:00:10,494;00:00:13,645;We engaged in intimate relations.
5;00:00:13,765;00:00:16,186;Queen Margaery walked in on us.
6;00:00:16,466;00:00:19,075;There is enough evidence
6;00:00:16,466;00:00:19,075;to bring a formal trial
7;00:00:19,195;00:00:21,716;for Ser Loras and Queen Margaery.
7;00:00:19,195;00:00:21,716;Take her.
8;00:00:21,991;00:00:25,010;Lancel Lannister.
8;00:00:21,991;00:00:25,010;Brother Lannister.
9;00:00:25,130;00:00:27,954;We abandon our family names.
9;00:00:25,130;00:00:27,954;Quite a family to abandon.
10;00:00:28,811;00:00:31,552;To forge a lasting bond with the people,
11;00:00:31,672;00:00:33,639;I will marry the leader
11;00:00:31,672;00:00:33,639;of an ancient family
12;00:00:33,759;00:00:35,337;and reopen the fighting pits.
13;00:00:36,374;00:00:37,620;It's a slave ship.
14;00:00:38,467;00:00:41,377;Take me to Slaver's Bay,
14;00:00:38,467;00:00:41,377;put a sword in my hand,
15;00:00:41,497;00:00:43,134;I will prove my worth.
16;00:00:43,254;00:00:45,010;I want you to be my wife.
17;00:00:45,130;00:00:47,190;We have to go, Myrcella. Now.
18;00:00:51,511;00:00:52,682;Drop your weapons.
19;00:00:56,134;00:00:57,567;We're going to have a baby.
20;00:00:57,687;00:01:00,196;From the way she's carrying,
20;00:00:57,687;00:01:00,196;it looks like a boy.
21;00:01:00,865;00:01:02,797;Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.
22;00:01:02,917;00:01:05,252;Sansa is in danger,
22;00:01:02,917;00:01:05,252;even if she doesn't realize it.
23;00:01:05,372;00:01:06,685;If you're ever in trouble,
24;00:01:06,805;00:01:10,311;light a candle in the highest window
24;00:01:06,805;00:01:10,311;of the Broken Tower.
25;00:01:12,186;00:01:13,420;Will you take this man?
26;00:01:14,242;00:01:15,302;I take this man.
27;00:01:15,601;00:01:17,719;You've known Sansa since she was a girl.
28;00:01:17,839;00:01:19,351;Now watch her become a woman.
29;00:01:21,414;00:01:24,579;I shall take back the North
29;00:01:21,414;00:01:24,579;from the thieves who stole it.
30;00:01:24,699;00:01:27,308;I shall mount Roose Bolton's head
30;00:01:24,699;00:01:27,308;on a spike.
31;00:01:27,428;00:01:29,750;The Queen and the Princess?
31;00:01:27,428;00:01:29,750;They're coming with us.
32;00:01:29,870;00:01:31,545;We march at sunrise.
33;00:01:31,665;00:01:33,181;And if you go north of the Wall,
34;00:01:33,301;00:01:36,733;gather the remaining free folk
34;00:01:33,301;00:01:36,733;wherever they are and bring them here.
35;00:01:36,853;00:01:38,726;I'll open the gates and let them through.
36;00:01:38,846;00:01:41,057;Make peace to save your people.
37;00:01:41,177;00:01:42,537;You're coming with me.

39;00:04:43,771;00:04:45,905;First Ranger, you have
39;00:04:43,771;00:04:45,905;command of Castle Black.
40;00:04:46,273;00:04:48,522;Lord Commander,
40;00:04:46,273;00:04:48,522;it is my duty to tell you
41;00:04:48,642;00:04:51,745;I believe this mission
41;00:04:48,642;00:04:51,745;to be reckless, foolhardy,
42;00:04:52,046;00:04:53,747;and an insult
42;00:04:52,046;00:04:53,747;to all the brothers
43;00:04:54,048;00:04:56,750;who have died
43;00:04:54,048;00:04:56,750;fighting the wildlings.
44;00:04:57,051;00:04:59,818;As always, thank you
44;00:04:57,051;00:04:59,818;for your honesty.
45;00:05:06,693;00:05:08,060;Safe travels, Lord Commander.
46;00:05:08,295;00:05:10,529;Thank you, Sam.
47;00:05:10,697;00:05:12,365;Oh, um...
48;00:05:18,037;00:05:19,437;It's dragonglass.
49;00:05:19,806;00:05:21,573;It's what I used
49;00:05:19,806;00:05:21,573;to kill the white walker.
50;00:05:27,080;00:05:28,981;I hope you don't need them.
51;00:05:29,182;00:05:31,215;Me, too.
52;00:05:46,432;00:05:47,598;Yah.
53;00:06:04,549;00:06:06,249;There he is.
54;00:06:10,355;00:06:12,489;That laugh.
55;00:06:12,691;00:06:14,792;Egg.
56;00:06:15,059;00:06:17,227;Egg laughed like that.
57;00:06:17,562;00:06:20,596;One of the first things
57;00:06:17,562;00:06:20,596;I remember.
58;00:06:23,968;00:06:27,637;His little brother Aegon.
58;00:06:23,968;00:06:27,637;He became king.
59;00:06:29,473;00:06:33,576;And before that,
59;00:06:29,473;00:06:33,576;he was a jolly fellow,
60;00:06:33,777;00:06:35,478;like this one.
61;00:06:40,250;00:06:44,119;Get him south, Gillyflower.
62;00:06:45,456;00:06:47,990;Before it's too late.
63;00:07:38,941;00:07:40,341;Theon, wait.
64;00:07:40,609;00:07:42,676;Not Theon, my lady.
64;00:07:40,609;00:07:42,676;Reek.
65;00:07:42,844;00:07:44,612;Help me.
66;00:07:46,114;00:07:48,482;You're his wife now.
67;00:07:48,650;00:07:50,684;Theon.
68;00:07:50,886;00:07:52,119;Do what he says.
69;00:07:52,387;00:07:53,708;Do what he says
69;00:07:52,387;00:07:53,708;or he'll hurt you.
70;00:07:53,855;00:07:56,457;He already hurts me every night.
71;00:07:56,725;00:07:57,965;All day I'm locked in this room
72;00:07:58,226;00:08:00,026;and every night he comes...
73;00:08:02,830;00:08:04,163;It can't be any worse.
74;00:08:04,465;00:08:08,034;It can.
74;00:08:04,465;00:08:08,034;It can always be worse.
75;00:08:17,510;00:08:18,831;What did he do to you?
75;00:08:17,510;00:08:18,831;Please.
76;00:08:19,046;00:08:21,580;You betrayed my family!
76;00:08:19,046;00:08:21,580;I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
77;00:08:21,881;00:08:23,983;You have to help me.
77;00:08:21,881;00:08:23,983;Theon, help me.
78;00:08:24,318;00:08:27,453;He'll see us.
78;00:08:24,318;00:08:27,453;You don't know him.
79;00:08:27,821;00:08:28,988;My family still has
79;00:08:27,821;00:08:28,988;friends in the North.
80;00:08:29,389;00:08:32,291;All I need to do is give a
80;00:08:29,389;00:08:32,291;signal and they'll rescue me.
81;00:08:32,592;00:08:34,793;Climb to the top
81;00:08:32,592;00:08:34,793;of the broken tower.
82;00:08:35,161;00:08:36,841;Light this candle
82;00:08:35,161;00:08:36,841;and put it in the window.
83;00:08:37,163;00:08:39,397;Promise me, Theon.
83;00:08:37,163;00:08:39,397;Reek! My name is Reek.
84;00:08:42,368;00:08:45,170;Your name is Theon Greyjoy.
85;00:08:46,739;00:08:48,674;Last surviving son
85;00:08:46,739;00:08:48,674;of Balon Greyjoy,
86;00:08:48,908;00:08:50,075;Lord of the Iron Islands.
87;00:08:50,276;00:08:51,676;Do you hear me?
88;00:08:54,947;00:08:56,514;Theon...
89;00:08:58,117;00:08:59,451;promise me.
90;00:10:03,080;00:10:04,813;Yes, Reek?
91;00:10:20,597;00:10:22,631;Egg.
92;00:10:22,799;00:10:25,034;Egg.
93;00:10:27,303;00:10:29,604;Mother's looking for you.
94;00:10:31,107;00:10:33,041;Egg.
95;00:10:34,977;00:10:37,612;Get some sleep, Sam.
96;00:10:37,947;00:10:39,981;You'll have to speak
96;00:10:37,947;00:10:39,981;for him tomorrow.
97;00:10:41,817;00:10:43,085;You don't know that.
98;00:10:43,319;00:10:45,653;Get some sleep.
99;00:10:45,888;00:10:48,322;I'll watch over him.
100;00:10:50,793;00:10:53,160;I'm staying, too.
101;00:10:53,462;00:10:55,162;He's always been good to me.
102;00:10:55,397;00:10:57,164;I can't leave him now.
103;00:10:58,200;00:11:00,468;Egg!
104;00:11:11,713;00:11:13,714;Egg.
105;00:11:15,049;00:11:17,384;I dreamed...
106;00:11:17,586;00:11:19,586;that I was old.
107;00:11:30,999;00:11:33,233;His name
107;00:11:30,999;00:11:33,233;was Aemon Targaryen.
108;00:11:34,768;00:11:36,503;He came to us
108;00:11:34,768;00:11:36,503;from King's Landing.
109;00:11:39,106;00:11:42,008;A maester of the Citadel,
109;00:11:39,106;00:11:42,008;chained and sworn,
110;00:11:42,443;00:11:45,411;and sworn brother of the
110;00:11:42,443;00:11:45,411;Night's Watch, ever faithful.
111;00:11:46,847;00:11:48,681;No man was wiser
112;00:11:48,915;00:11:51,951;or gentler or kinder.
113;00:11:53,887;00:11:56,522;At the Wall,
113;00:11:53,887;00:11:56,522;a dozen lord commanders
114;00:11:56,857;00:11:58,958;came and went during
114;00:11:56,857;00:11:58,958;his years of service,
115;00:11:59,259;00:12:01,293;but he was always there
115;00:11:59,259;00:12:01,293;to counsel them.
116;00:12:04,765;00:12:06,298;He was the blood
116;00:12:04,765;00:12:06,298;of the dragon...
117;00:12:08,601;00:12:10,702;but now his fire has gone out.
118;00:12:13,439;00:12:15,006;And now his watch is ended.
119;00:12:15,308;00:12:17,709;And now his watch is ended.
120;00:12:46,438;00:12:48,739;You're losing
120;00:12:46,438;00:12:48,739;all your friends, Tarly.
121;00:13:26,310;00:13:27,944;My beautiful wife.
122;00:13:34,118;00:13:35,679;When my father told me
122;00:13:34,118;00:13:35,679;we were marrying,
123;00:13:35,819;00:13:38,855;I half expected
123;00:13:35,819;00:13:38,855;a fat, bearded beast.
124;00:13:43,794;00:13:46,462;Do you know how pleased
124;00:13:43,794;00:13:46,462;I was when I saw you?
125;00:13:46,730;00:13:48,897;You've made me very happy.
126;00:13:53,903;00:13:56,872;Our scouts report that Stannis
126;00:13:53,903;00:13:56,872;Baratheon rides for Winterfell.
127;00:13:57,140;00:13:59,642;He's a respected commander.
128;00:13:59,976;00:14:03,145;His troops are loyal
128;00:13:59,976;00:14:03,145;and battle-tested.
129;00:14:03,579;00:14:07,215;He's hired thousands of foreign
129;00:14:03,579;00:14:07,215;sellswords to bolster his army.
130;00:14:07,583;00:14:10,385;But this storm is a stroke
130;00:14:07,583;00:14:10,385;of luck for us northerners.
131;00:14:12,421;00:14:15,190;Our people are used
131;00:14:12,421;00:14:15,190;to fighting in the frost.
132;00:14:17,059;00:14:20,194;His army is out there now
132;00:14:17,059;00:14:20,194;suffering in the snow.
133;00:14:21,930;00:14:23,398;One day I'll be
133;00:14:21,930;00:14:23,398;Lord of Winterfell
134;00:14:23,666;00:14:25,667;and Warden of the North.
135;00:14:25,934;00:14:28,035;You'll be my lady and Wardeness.
136;00:14:31,507;00:14:33,341;But isn't
136;00:14:31,507;00:14:33,341;your stepmother pregnant?
137;00:14:33,542;00:14:36,310;What of it?
138;00:14:36,577;00:14:38,279;What happens if she has a boy?
139;00:14:40,048;00:14:41,548;Then I'll have a baby brother.
140;00:14:41,783;00:14:43,150;But he'll be the heir.
141;00:14:43,418;00:14:45,419;I'm Lord Bolton's eldest son.
142;00:14:45,687;00:14:46,954;But you're a bastard.
143;00:14:47,289;00:14:49,957;A trueborn will always
143;00:14:47,289;00:14:49,957;have the stronger claim.
144;00:14:53,194;00:14:55,529;I've been naturalized
144;00:14:53,194;00:14:55,529;by a royal decree from--
145;00:14:55,797;00:14:58,765;Tommen Baratheon?
145;00:14:55,797;00:14:58,765;Another bastard.
146;00:15:05,807;00:15:08,675;Bastards can rise
146;00:15:05,807;00:15:08,675;high in the world.
147;00:15:08,976;00:15:11,744;Like your half-brother
147;00:15:08,976;00:15:11,744;Jon Snow.
148;00:15:12,779;00:15:15,715;Born the bastard of Winterfell,
149;00:15:16,083;00:15:18,718;now the Lord Commander
149;00:15:16,083;00:15:18,718;of the Night's Watch.
150;00:15:20,754;00:15:22,922;You didn't know?
151;00:15:23,257;00:15:26,091;Yes, he's done
151;00:15:23,257;00:15:26,091;very well for himself.
152;00:15:26,259;00:15:27,860;Oh.
153;00:15:28,228;00:15:30,463;I nearly forgot why
153;00:15:28,228;00:15:30,463;I asked you to join me.
154;00:15:30,664;00:15:32,097;Come, my lady.
155;00:15:43,776;00:15:45,344;Your northern friend.
156;00:15:48,781;00:15:51,049;Reek told me
156;00:15:48,781;00:15:51,049;you wanted to leave.
157;00:15:51,184;00:15:52,617;Why?
158;00:15:52,852;00:15:54,253;Winterfell is your home
159;00:15:54,487;00:15:56,855;and I am your husband.
160;00:15:57,090;00:15:58,757;Tough old bird.
161;00:15:59,091;00:16:01,192;Everyone talks
161;00:15:59,091;00:16:01,192;when I start peeling them.
162;00:16:01,427;00:16:03,595;But this one,
163;00:16:03,962;00:16:06,431;her heart gave out before
163;00:16:03,962;00:16:06,431;I even got to her face.
164;00:16:08,934;00:16:11,836;We do breed them tough
164;00:16:08,934;00:16:11,836;in the North.
165;00:16:18,110;00:16:20,577;Bring my wife
165;00:16:18,110;00:16:20,577;back to her chamber.
166;00:16:20,879;00:16:22,980;It's far too cold
166;00:16:20,879;00:16:22,980;out here for a lady.
167;00:16:23,282;00:16:26,050;You should hold on
167;00:16:23,282;00:16:26,050;to your candles.
168;00:16:26,318;00:16:29,153;The nights are so long now.
169;00:17:19,102;00:17:21,370;40 horses
169;00:17:19,102;00:17:21,370;died in the night.
170;00:17:21,671;00:17:24,206;We'll lose more come sunset.
171;00:17:24,507;00:17:25,774;We're running out of food.
172;00:17:26,176;00:17:28,543;We can't open the supply
172;00:17:26,176;00:17:28,543;line until the snow clears.
173;00:17:33,883;00:17:34,816;What else?
174;00:17:35,118;00:17:38,086;The Stormcrows
174;00:17:35,118;00:17:38,086;rode off last night.
175;00:17:41,457;00:17:43,024;500 men.
176;00:17:46,261;00:17:48,296;Sellswords.
177;00:17:48,564;00:17:50,732;Loyal to nothing but gold.
178;00:17:54,703;00:17:56,971;We still have a hard
178;00:17:54,703;00:17:56,971;march to Winterfell
179;00:17:57,373;00:17:58,406;and we won't be marching
179;00:17:57,373;00:17:58,406;anywhere in this weather.
180;00:17:58,573;00:18:00,208;And?
181;00:18:00,442;00:18:01,775;This isn't our time.
182;00:18:02,211;00:18:05,346;We should head back to Castle
182;00:18:02,211;00:18:05,346;Black when the snow clears.
183;00:18:05,714;00:18:07,882;I retreated from
183;00:18:05,714;00:18:07,882;King's Landing, Ser Davos.
184;00:18:08,250;00:18:11,351;If I retreat again,
184;00:18:08,250;00:18:11,351;I'll become the King Who Ran.
185;00:18:11,653;00:18:13,453;Your Grace--
185;00:18:11,653;00:18:13,453;Winter is coming.
186;00:18:13,822;00:18:16,490;Those aren't just the Stark words.
186;00:18:13,822;00:18:16,490;It's a fact.
187;00:18:16,791;00:18:19,493;If we march
187;00:18:16,791;00:18:19,493;back to Castle Black,
188;00:18:19,761;00:18:21,795;we winter at Castle Black.
189;00:18:22,096;00:18:23,797;And who can say how many years
190;00:18:24,065;00:18:25,566;this winter will last?
191;00:18:25,967;00:18:27,700;It's better to wait for the right
191;00:18:25,967;00:18:27,700;time than risk everything.
192;00:18:28,069;00:18:30,029;This is the right time
192;00:18:28,069;00:18:30,029;and I will risk everything.
193;00:18:30,271;00:18:33,306;Because if I don't, we've lost.
194;00:18:33,508;00:18:35,442;We march to victory
195;00:18:35,676;00:18:39,346;or we march to defeat.
196;00:18:39,647;00:18:41,948;But we go forward.
196;00:18:39,647;00:18:41,948;Only forward.
197;00:18:51,926;00:18:53,626;Your Grace.
198;00:18:58,465;00:19:00,699;I've trusted in your visions
199;00:19:01,000;00:19:03,835;and your prophecies for years.
200;00:19:04,104;00:19:06,605;You saw it yourself, my king,
201;00:19:06,873;00:19:08,541;when you stared into the flames.
202;00:19:08,841;00:19:09,975;A great battle in the snow.
203;00:19:10,310;00:19:12,211;I don't know what I saw.
203;00:19:10,310;00:19:12,211;You do know.
204;00:19:12,446;00:19:13,446;Trust yourself.
205;00:19:13,713;00:19:15,614;And you?
205;00:19:13,713;00:19:15,614;Do you trust yourself?
206;00:19:15,848;00:19:18,116;I trust in the Lord.
207;00:19:20,620;00:19:22,888;Are you sure?
208;00:19:28,661;00:19:31,897;I have seen myself walk along
208;00:19:28,661;00:19:31,897;the battlements of Winterfell.
209;00:19:32,331;00:19:36,901;I have seen the flayed man
209;00:19:32,331;00:19:36,901;banners lowered to the ground.
210;00:19:45,711;00:19:49,147;But sometimes sacrifices must
210;00:19:45,711;00:19:49,147;be made to ensure victory.
211;00:19:51,349;00:19:54,585;I have shown you
211;00:19:51,349;00:19:54,585;the power of king's blood.
212;00:19:54,853;00:19:55,920;The usurper Robb Stark.
213;00:19:56,221;00:19:58,322;The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
214;00:19:58,657;00:20:00,725;We don't have
214;00:19:58,657;00:20:00,725;Robert's bastard here.
215;00:20:01,026;00:20:04,361;No, we have someone better.
216;00:20:06,197;00:20:08,232;And your blood
216;00:20:06,197;00:20:08,232;runs through her veins.
217;00:20:10,067;00:20:11,835;Have you lost your mind?
218;00:20:12,036;00:20:13,470;Do you doubt me?
219;00:20:13,671;00:20:16,006;Still?
220;00:20:16,274;00:20:17,841;After all that you've seen.
221;00:20:18,109;00:20:19,576;There must be another way.
222;00:20:19,877;00:20:22,179;Leeches or--
222;00:20:19,877;00:20:22,179;There is only one way.
223;00:20:22,547;00:20:26,149;You must become king
223;00:20:22,547;00:20:26,149;before the Long Night begins.
224;00:20:26,517;00:20:28,318;Only you can lead
224;00:20:26,517;00:20:28,318;the living against the dead.
225;00:20:28,585;00:20:31,721;All your life has led us
225;00:20:28,585;00:20:31,721;to this moment.
226;00:20:32,056;00:20:34,124;To this decision.
226;00:20:32,056;00:20:34,124;She's my daughter.
227;00:20:36,560;00:20:38,594;Get out.
228;00:21:00,884;00:21:02,284;There's always
228;00:21:00,884;00:21:02,284;some sort of grub on.
229;00:21:02,585;00:21:04,486;A bit of mutton would be nice.
230;00:21:08,158;00:21:12,027;A beauty from beyond the Wall.
231;00:21:12,461;00:21:14,981;Where you going, love? Aren't we
231;00:21:12,461;00:21:14,981;better-looking than the fat man?
232;00:21:14,997;00:21:17,765;No, the question is is she pretty
232;00:21:14,997;00:21:17,765;down south in the real world
233;00:21:18,133;00:21:20,053;or is she pretty 'cause
233;00:21:18,133;00:21:20,053;she's the only girl here?
234;00:21:20,069;00:21:21,736;Even in White Harbor,
234;00:21:20,069;00:21:21,736;I'd want a kiss.
235;00:21:22,004;00:21:24,772;Come on, love, give us a kiss.
236;00:21:25,274;00:21:27,676;Leave me alone. - Oh, if you were my girl,
236;00:21:25,274;00:21:27,676;I wouldn't leave you alone.
237;00:21:28,010;00:21:29,210;One little kiss.
237;00:21:28,010;00:21:29,210;Come on, give him a kiss.
238;00:21:29,511;00:21:31,579;A man gets lonely
238;00:21:29,511;00:21:31,579;guarding the Wall.
239;00:21:36,284;00:21:37,484;There's no need to be rude.
240;00:21:37,785;00:21:39,553;We just want a little affection.
241;00:21:39,787;00:21:42,256;Ooh.
242;00:21:43,758;00:21:45,559;Get your hands off her.
243;00:21:45,827;00:21:48,294;Brother Derek, Brother Brant,
244;00:21:48,629;00:21:50,463;I believe you both
244;00:21:48,629;00:21:50,463;have guard duty tonight.
245;00:21:50,664;00:21:52,065;Sam the Slayer.
246;00:21:52,366;00:21:53,687;You gonna slay me
246;00:21:52,366;00:21:53,687;with that sword?
247;00:21:53,935;00:21:55,102;Look at his hand shake.
248;00:21:55,302;00:21:57,137;Gilly, go on.
249;00:21:57,471;00:21:59,372;Get back to your room,
249;00:21:57,471;00:21:59,372;lock the door.
250;00:22:02,876;00:22:04,477;I'm warning you.
250;00:22:02,876;00:22:04,477;Come on.
251;00:22:04,645;00:22:06,312;Come on.
252;00:22:09,983;00:22:11,551;Sam!
253;00:22:11,818;00:22:14,120;You lying sack of shit.
254;00:22:14,455;00:22:15,921;Killed a white walker, eh?
255;00:22:16,223;00:22:18,424;You fat-ass fuck.
256;00:22:18,659;00:22:20,125;Come on, get up.
257;00:22:20,493;00:22:22,861;- No!
257;00:22:20,493;00:22:22,861;- This your hero? This hog?
258;00:22:23,062;00:22:25,964;Leave him alone!
259;00:22:26,332;00:22:28,500;Stubborn little wildling
259;00:22:26,332;00:22:28,500;bitch, aren't you?
260;00:22:30,670;00:22:32,704;Come on!
260;00:22:30,670;00:22:32,704;No!
261;00:22:32,972;00:22:35,741;Sam! Sam! Sam!
261;00:22:32,972;00:22:35,741;Come on!
262;00:22:44,884;00:22:46,985;Sam! Sam!
262;00:22:44,884;00:22:46,985;Come on.
263;00:22:47,319;00:22:48,853;- Right.
264;00:22:49,221;00:22:51,489;I'll deal with this.
265;00:22:53,425;00:22:55,326;- Turn her over.
265;00:22:53,425;00:22:55,326;- All right.
266;00:22:57,396;00:23:00,598;I said get your hands off her.
267;00:23:00,932;00:23:02,493;You're gonna
267;00:23:00,932;00:23:02,493;get yourself killed.
268;00:23:02,567;00:23:04,635;Your lover Jon Snow's
268;00:23:02,567;00:23:04,635;not here to save you.
269;00:23:05,003;00:23:07,371;I killed a white walker,
269;00:23:05,003;00:23:07,371;I killed a Thenn.
270;00:23:07,673;00:23:10,240;I'll take my chances with you.
271;00:23:25,790;00:23:28,457;Sam!
272;00:23:30,360;00:23:32,328;I'm all right.
272;00:23:30,360;00:23:32,328;You're not.
273;00:23:32,562;00:23:34,931;Just a bit woozy.
274;00:23:59,822;00:24:02,262;The next time you see something
274;00:23:59,822;00:24:02,262;like that, you leave it alone.
275;00:24:02,558;00:24:05,293;I will not.
275;00:24:02,558;00:24:05,293;They would have--
276;00:24:08,630;00:24:10,465;I don't know what
276;00:24:08,630;00:24:10,465;they would have done.
277;00:24:10,833;00:24:13,001;I know they would have killed
277;00:24:10,833;00:24:13,001;you if Ghost hadn't come.
278;00:24:13,302;00:24:16,136;No. No, no.
278;00:24:13,302;00:24:16,136;They were tiring out.
279;00:24:16,437;00:24:18,939;I had them
279;00:24:16,437;00:24:18,939;in the palm of my hand.
280;00:24:20,175;00:24:22,209;Don't be stupid, Sam.
281;00:24:22,443;00:24:25,112;You're not a fighter.
282;00:24:25,413;00:24:26,646;What kind of man would I be
283;00:24:26,982;00:24:29,283;if I ran away when I saw
283;00:24:26,982;00:24:29,283;someone hurting you?
284;00:24:29,484;00:24:31,952;Just promise me
285;00:24:32,320;00:24:34,755;whatever happens, you'll
285;00:24:32,320;00:24:34,755;take care of Little Sam.
286;00:24:34,989;00:24:36,723;But of course I will.
287;00:24:36,924;00:24:39,125;And...
288;00:24:39,427;00:24:41,628;I'll take care of you, too.
289;00:24:48,168;00:24:49,769;I need more water.
290;00:24:53,607;00:24:55,775;Stay.
291;00:24:55,976;00:24:57,676;Please?
292;00:25:58,002;00:25:59,436;Am I hurting you?
293;00:26:03,374;00:26:04,775;Are you sure?
294;00:26:34,237;00:26:36,639;Oh, my!
295;00:26:54,590;00:26:56,670;A rare find for the
295;00:26:54,590;00:26:56,670;fighting pits, my friends.
296;00:26:56,893;00:27:00,729;Not your usual street tough
296;00:26:56,893;00:27:00,729;or drunken pirate.
297;00:27:00,997;00:27:04,132;This one's a Westerosi knight
298;00:27:04,500;00:27:08,436;from an ancient house
298;00:27:04,500;00:27:08,436;trained in sword and lance.
299;00:27:08,738;00:27:11,006;He fought beside
299;00:27:08,738;00:27:11,006;the stag king Robert
300;00:27:11,306;00:27:12,841;on the far side
300;00:27:11,306;00:27:12,841;of the Narrow Sea.
301;00:27:13,275;00:27:16,110;He was first through the breach
301;00:27:13,275;00:27:16,110;during the Siege of Spike,
302;00:27:16,445;00:27:19,580;slaughtering 50 men
302;00:27:16,445;00:27:19,580;with his flaming sword.
303;00:27:19,948;00:27:23,717;He killed the great Khal
303;00:27:19,948;00:27:23,717;Drogo in single combat.
304;00:27:23,952;00:27:26,087;Betrayed by his woman,
305;00:27:26,455;00:27:29,690;he sold himself into slavery
305;00:27:26,455;00:27:29,690;to repay his debts.
306;00:27:30,125;00:27:33,627;Bidding begins at 12 gold honors.
307;00:27:33,862;00:27:37,097;13.
307;00:27:33,862;00:27:37,097;Do I have 14?
308;00:27:37,331;00:27:41,068;15?
308;00:27:37,331;00:27:41,068;15 gold honors.
309;00:27:41,302;00:27:44,438;Do I hear 16?
309;00:27:41,302;00:27:44,438;16?
310;00:27:44,606;00:27:46,306;20.
311;00:27:46,474;00:27:47,775;Sold.
312;00:27:57,485;00:28:00,120;Wait! You have
312;00:27:57,485;00:28:00,120;to buy me as well.
313;00:28:00,288;00:28:01,688;Why?
314;00:28:02,690;00:28:04,224;We're a team.
315;00:28:04,492;00:28:05,959;I'm a great fighter, too.
316;00:28:09,463;00:28:11,998;He's funny.
316;00:28:09,463;00:28:11,998;You have to give him that.
317;00:28:39,092;00:28:41,760;You're right, he's funny.
318;00:28:49,201;00:28:50,602;Thank you, my lord.
318;00:28:49,201;00:28:50,602;Thank you.
319;00:28:50,770;00:28:51,970;Yes.
320;00:28:52,204;00:28:54,205;My lord, if I may.
321;00:28:54,540;00:28:56,441;I've heard Meereen
321;00:28:54,540;00:28:56,441;has become a free city.
322;00:28:56,909;00:28:59,829;You might run into trouble if you try
322;00:28:56,909;00:28:59,829;to fight slaves in the fighting pits.
323;00:28:59,845;00:29:02,126;Now, if you were to fight freed
323;00:28:59,845;00:29:02,126;men who'd be paid a wage--
324;00:29:05,384;00:29:07,152;There's your wages, funny man.
325;00:29:07,453;00:29:09,787;Should last the rest
325;00:29:07,453;00:29:09,787;of your life.
326;00:29:11,457;00:29:14,258;These are warrior
326;00:29:11,457;00:29:14,258;hands, not a serving girl's.
327;00:29:14,459;00:29:16,060;5, going once...
328;00:29:20,532;00:29:23,534;How long before the King of
328;00:29:20,532;00:29:23,534;Meereen comes to claim my pillow?
329;00:29:23,769;00:29:25,335;Don't be ridiculous.
330;00:29:25,637;00:29:29,406;My marriage to Hizdahr
330;00:29:25,637;00:29:29,406;is political.
331;00:29:29,740;00:29:31,775;I think he's smart enough
331;00:29:29,740;00:29:31,775;to understand that.
332;00:29:33,878;00:29:35,838;I think the Sons of the
332;00:29:33,878;00:29:35,838;Harpy have stopped killing
333;00:29:35,880;00:29:37,814;because their leader
333;00:29:35,880;00:29:37,814;was made king.
334;00:29:40,818;00:29:43,019;Are you jealous?
335;00:29:43,421;00:29:45,656;You think I'm petty enough
335;00:29:43,421;00:29:45,656;to speak ill of a man
336;00:29:45,990;00:29:47,991;just because he
336;00:29:45,990;00:29:47,991;represents competition?
337;00:29:48,159;00:29:50,026;I do.
338;00:29:51,829;00:29:53,396;You're right.
339;00:29:53,664;00:29:56,465;My motivations
339;00:29:53,664;00:29:56,465;are entirely impure.
340;00:30:05,342;00:30:06,975;Doesn't make me wrong.
341;00:30:11,781;00:30:15,551;You told me yourself I can't fight
341;00:30:11,781;00:30:15,551;enemies within and without.
342;00:30:15,852;00:30:18,087;So when enemies without
342;00:30:15,852;00:30:18,087;come knocking,
343;00:30:18,422;00:30:20,155;I need the city
343;00:30:18,422;00:30:20,155;of Meereen behind me.
344;00:30:20,356;00:30:22,791;I have no choice.
345;00:30:23,026;00:30:24,392;Everyone has a choice.
346;00:30:24,660;00:30:26,061;Even slaves
346;00:30:24,660;00:30:26,061;have a choice--
347;00:30:26,295;00:30:27,896;death or slavery.
348;00:30:28,164;00:30:30,799;So what else can I do, hmm?
349;00:30:32,802;00:30:34,803;Marry me instead.
350;00:30:36,372;00:30:40,675;Even if I wanted to do
350;00:30:36,372;00:30:40,675;such an inadvisable thing,
351;00:30:40,876;00:30:42,244;I couldn't.
352;00:30:42,445;00:30:44,045;Why not?
353;00:30:44,380;00:30:46,047;You are queen.
353;00:30:44,380;00:30:46,047;You can do what you like.
354;00:30:48,484;00:30:51,919;No, I can't.
355;00:30:52,320;00:30:54,722;Then you are the only person
355;00:30:52,320;00:30:54,722;in Meereen who's not free.
356;00:31:06,168;00:31:10,404;And I know I'm here to serve
356;00:31:06,168;00:31:10,404;my queen and not give advice,
357;00:31:10,705;00:31:12,706;but can I make
357;00:31:10,705;00:31:12,706;one more suggestion?
358;00:31:16,811;00:31:18,812;Of course.
359;00:31:21,349;00:31:23,884;On the day of the great games,
360;00:31:24,252;00:31:26,753;gather all the Great
360;00:31:24,252;00:31:26,753;Masters and Wise Masters
361;00:31:27,054;00:31:29,990;and Worthy Masters you can find
362;00:31:30,258;00:31:31,724;and slaughter them all.
363;00:31:35,529;00:31:38,865;I am a queen, not a butcher.
364;00:31:43,837;00:31:46,773;All rulers are either
364;00:31:43,837;00:31:46,773;butchers or meat.
365;00:31:55,916;00:31:59,084;You there. Where would
365;00:31:55,916;00:31:59,084;I find the High Septon
366;00:31:59,519;00:32:02,454;or High Sparrow or whatever
366;00:31:59,519;00:32:02,454;bloody fool name he's got?
367;00:32:02,856;00:32:06,292;It's not as good a name as
367;00:32:02,856;00:32:06,292;Queen of Thorns, I'll admit.
368;00:32:07,961;00:32:09,661;You should have the decency
369;00:32:09,963;00:32:12,031;to stand when
369;00:32:09,963;00:32:12,031;you speak to a lady.
370;00:32:12,432;00:32:14,899;You should have the decency
370;00:32:12,432;00:32:14,899;to kneel before the gods.
371;00:32:15,201;00:32:16,522;Don't spar with me,
371;00:32:15,201;00:32:16,522;little fellow.
372;00:32:19,772;00:32:22,541;For me, it's the knees.
373;00:32:22,742;00:32:24,476;You?
373;00:32:22,742;00:32:24,476;Hips.
374;00:32:24,644;00:32:26,545;Ah.
375;00:32:26,879;00:32:30,549;A man of the people.
375;00:32:26,879;00:32:30,549;Is that your game?
376;00:32:30,883;00:32:34,185;It's an old game.
376;00:32:30,883;00:32:34,185;Dull and unconvincing.
377;00:32:34,419;00:32:36,554;A man of the people
378;00:32:36,889;00:32:39,224;who does Cersei's
378;00:32:36,889;00:32:39,224;dirty work for her.
379;00:32:40,659;00:32:42,327;The people always
379;00:32:40,659;00:32:42,327;do the dirty work.
380;00:32:42,761;00:32:45,263;Spare me the homilies. I can
380;00:32:42,761;00:32:45,263;smell a fraud from a mile away.
381;00:32:45,464;00:32:46,731;Useful talent.
382;00:32:47,066;00:32:49,700;I'm here for my grandson
382;00:32:47,066;00:32:49,700;and granddaughter.
383;00:32:50,001;00:32:52,236;Your grandson and granddaughter
384;00:32:52,504;00:32:55,539;swore sacred vows and lied.
385;00:32:55,807;00:32:58,008;The Father judges us all.
386;00:32:58,243;00:33:00,378;Sons of high lords,
387;00:33:00,612;00:33:02,546;sons of fishermen.
388;00:33:02,914;00:33:05,815;If you break his laws,
388;00:33:02,914;00:33:05,815;you will be punished.
389;00:33:07,085;00:33:08,551;Don't you walk away from me.
390;00:33:08,920;00:33:10,587;You don't give commands
390;00:33:08,920;00:33:10,587;here, Lady Olenna.
391;00:33:10,821;00:33:12,222;What is it you want?
392;00:33:12,423;00:33:14,324;Gold?
393;00:33:14,692;00:33:17,294;I'll make you the richest
393;00:33:14,692;00:33:17,294;septon who ever lived.
394;00:33:18,863;00:33:21,163;What, then?
395;00:33:21,465;00:33:24,100;I imagine this
395;00:33:21,465;00:33:24,100;is strange for you.
396;00:33:24,435;00:33:26,736;Everyone you meet
396;00:33:24,435;00:33:26,736;has a hidden motive
397;00:33:27,104;00:33:30,106;and you pride yourself
397;00:33:27,104;00:33:30,106;on sniffing it out.
398;00:33:30,441;00:33:32,375;But I'm telling you
398;00:33:30,441;00:33:32,375;a simple truth.
399;00:33:32,610;00:33:34,811;I serve the gods.
400;00:33:35,045;00:33:36,746;The gods demand justice.
401;00:33:37,047;00:33:39,282;How do they communicate
401;00:33:37,047;00:33:39,282;their demands?
402;00:33:39,516;00:33:41,050;By raven or horse?
403;00:33:41,385;00:33:44,086;By the holy text,
403;00:33:41,385;00:33:44,086;The Seven-Pointed Star.
404;00:33:44,388;00:33:46,522;If you don't have one
404;00:33:44,388;00:33:46,522;in your library,
405;00:33:46,790;00:33:47,790;I'll give you my own.
406;00:33:48,125;00:33:50,359;I've read
406;00:33:48,125;00:33:50,359;The Seven-Pointed Star.
407;00:33:50,827;00:33:54,763;Then you'll remember the passages
407;00:33:50,827;00:33:54,763;concerning buggery and perjury.
408;00:33:55,064;00:33:57,165;Your grandchildren
408;00:33:55,064;00:33:57,165;will be punished
409;00:33:57,567;00:34:01,770;in the same manner as anyone
409;00:33:57,567;00:34:01,770;who breaks the sacred laws.
410;00:34:02,071;00:34:03,405;Half the men,
410;00:34:02,071;00:34:03,405;women, and children
411;00:34:03,740;00:34:06,909;in this foul city
411;00:34:03,740;00:34:06,909;break the sacred laws.
412;00:34:07,243;00:34:10,245;You live among murderers,
412;00:34:07,243;00:34:10,245;thieves, and rapists,
413;00:34:10,512;00:34:12,213;and yet you punish Loras
414;00:34:12,514;00:34:15,783;for shagging some perfumed ponce
415;00:34:16,085;00:34:17,986;and Margaery for defending
415;00:34:16,085;00:34:17,986;her brother?
416;00:34:18,387;00:34:22,424;Yes. The gods' laws must
416;00:34:18,387;00:34:22,424;be applied to all equally.

446;00:36:34,619;00:36:36,653;I'll call in the army.
447;00:36:36,888;00:36:38,789;I'll take back the sept

557;00:44:35,317;00:44:38,086;You've always been rather impressed
557;00:44:35,317;00:44:38,086;with yourself, haven't you?
558;00:44:39,488;00:44:42,223;The past is the past.
559;00:44:42,591;00:44:45,693;The future is all
559;00:44:42,591;00:44:45,693;that's worth discussing.
560;00:44:47,362;00:44:48,829;The future of House Tyrell.
561;00:44:49,197;00:44:51,632;Don't pretend to have
561;00:44:49,197;00:44:51,632;any concern for my house,
562;00:44:51,867;00:44:53,434;my grandchildren or me.
563;00:44:53,802;00:44:56,136;I should have known
563;00:44:53,802;00:44:56,136;you'd return to the capital
564;00:44:56,471;00:44:58,405;as soon as things
564;00:44:56,471;00:44:58,405;started to go wrong.
565;00:44:58,807;00:45:00,707;I promise you--
565;00:44:58,807;00:45:00,707;I promise you, Lord Baelish,
566;00:45:00,975;00:45:02,842;that our fates are joined.
567;00:45:03,111;00:45:04,678;Together we murdered a king.
568;00:45:05,046;00:45:08,348;If my house should fall,
568;00:45:05,046;00:45:08,348;I will have nothing to hide.
569;00:45:09,717;00:45:12,819;And if I should meet
569;00:45:09,717;00:45:12,819;with some accident
570;00:45:13,154;00:45:16,022;here at your broken
570;00:45:13,154;00:45:16,022;little flesh market,
571;00:45:16,357;00:45:19,425;they'll never even find
571;00:45:16,357;00:45:19,425;what's left of you.
572;00:45:19,627;00:45:22,095;So...
573;00:45:22,362;00:45:24,163;do you deny a part in all this?
574;00:45:24,465;00:45:27,366;Cersei summoned me
574;00:45:24,465;00:45:27,366;to King's Landing.
575;00:45:27,635;00:45:29,002;I dared not refuse her.
576;00:45:29,236;00:45:30,737;And what did she want?
577;00:45:31,072;00:45:33,906;A piece of information
577;00:45:31,072;00:45:33,906;she knew that I had.
578;00:45:34,208;00:45:37,543;Neither silence
578;00:45:34,208;00:45:37,543;nor lies were an option.
579;00:45:37,844;00:45:40,179;But I have other information
580;00:45:40,414;00:45:41,814;of which she is unaware.
581;00:45:43,717;00:45:46,185;And as you say,
581;00:45:43,717;00:45:46,185;our interests are aligned.
582;00:45:48,322;00:45:50,055;I have a gift for you.
583;00:45:50,256;00:45:51,690;What kind of gift?
584;00:45:51,992;00:45:55,027;The same kind I gave Cersei.
585;00:45:55,261;00:45:56,929;A handsome young man.
586;00:46:11,210;00:46:13,578;Many worthy
586;00:46:11,210;00:46:13,578;fighters have died
587;00:46:13,912;00:46:16,014;trying to make it
587;00:46:13,912;00:46:16,014;to the great games.
588;00:46:16,449;00:46:19,184;When most of you worthless scum
588;00:46:16,449;00:46:19,184;join them in death this afternoon,
589;00:46:19,585;00:46:22,454;it will represent a significant
589;00:46:19,585;00:46:22,454;rise in your station.
590;00:46:22,755;00:46:25,389;But if you do happen
590;00:46:22,755;00:46:25,389;to triumph here,
591;00:46:25,791;00:46:28,192;you will fight at the Great
591;00:46:25,791;00:46:28,192;Pit of Daznak itself
592;00:46:28,426;00:46:29,794;in front of the queen.
593;00:46:30,228;00:46:34,165;So whatever happens, the gods
593;00:46:30,228;00:46:34,165;have smiled upon you today.
594;00:46:34,599;00:46:38,469;This is the day your lives
594;00:46:34,599;00:46:38,469;actually start to mean something.
595;00:46:40,805;00:46:43,240;You and you.
595;00:46:40,805;00:46:43,240;You.
596;00:46:44,709;00:46:46,544;You two.
597;00:46:48,913;00:46:50,247;You, you, and you.
598;00:46:51,249;00:46:53,184;Up.
599;00:46:53,552;00:46:56,153;Valar morghulis.
599;00:46:53,552;00:46:56,153;- Valar dohaeris.
600;00:46:56,387;00:46:58,221;Prepare yourselves.
601;00:47:10,501;00:47:13,035;Sitting through the great
601;00:47:10,501;00:47:13,035;games will be bad enough.
602;00:47:13,470;00:47:16,072;For generations in the days
602;00:47:13,470;00:47:16,072;leading up to the great games,
603;00:47:16,407;00:47:17,768;it has been customary
603;00:47:16,407;00:47:17,768;for our ruler
604;00:47:17,941;00:47:19,475;to make the rounds
604;00:47:17,941;00:47:19,475;of the lower pits
605;00:47:19,843;00:47:21,977;to pay the fighters there
605;00:47:19,843;00:47:21,977;the honor of her presence.
606;00:47:25,916;00:47:28,984;Move yourselves.
607;00:47:35,291;00:47:36,658;Your Grace.
608;00:47:36,860;00:47:38,060;Your future Grace.
609;00:47:38,294;00:47:40,495;You honor us all.
610;00:47:42,999;00:47:45,167;Stand there.
611;00:47:45,501;00:47:47,802;Stand straight.
611;00:47:45,501;00:47:47,802;That's the fucking queen.
612;00:47:49,839;00:47:51,440;We fight and
612;00:47:49,839;00:47:51,440;die for your glory,
613;00:47:51,507;00:47:53,375;O glorious queen.
614;00:47:56,212;00:47:58,280;We fight and
614;00:47:56,212;00:47:58,280;die for your glory,
615;00:47:58,514;00:48:00,148;O glorious queen.
616;00:48:01,784;00:48:04,152;Fight!
617;00:49:02,677;00:49:03,710;I think I've seen enough.
618;00:49:04,011;00:49:06,713;Your Grace, it is a tradition
619;00:49:07,080;00:49:10,049;for the queen to stay
619;00:49:07,080;00:49:10,049;until the victor has emerged.
620;00:49:10,450;00:49:12,530;I've sacrificed more than
620;00:49:10,450;00:49:12,530;enough for your traditions.
621;00:49:17,291;00:49:18,691;What are you doing?
622;00:49:27,967;00:49:29,301;Wait your turn,
622;00:49:27,967;00:49:29,301;you piece of fucking filth.
623;00:50:59,322;00:51:00,789;Get him out of my sight.
624;00:51:01,024;00:51:03,058;Khaleesi, please.
625;00:51:03,359;00:51:05,493;I just need
625;00:51:03,359;00:51:05,493;a moment of your time.
626;00:51:05,728;00:51:07,362;I brought you a gift.
627;00:51:08,631;00:51:10,131;It's true.
628;00:51:11,534;00:51:13,968;He has.
629;00:51:14,169;00:51:15,837;Who are you?
630;00:51:17,172;00:51:19,073;I am the gift.
631;00:51:21,209;00:51:23,878;It's a pleasure
631;00:51:21,209;00:51:23,878;to meet you, Your Grace.
632;00:51:25,047;00:51:27,048;My name is Tyrion Lannister.
633;00:52:00,214;00:52:01,948;This is horrible.
634;00:52:02,183;00:52:04,084;Unacceptable.
635;00:52:05,886;00:52:08,088;Are they feeding you
635;00:52:05,886;00:52:08,088;enough at least?
636;00:52:09,457;00:52:12,425;I brought you this.
636;00:52:09,457;00:52:12,425;Venison.
637;00:52:12,626;00:52:14,594;It's quite good.
638;00:52:17,764;00:52:20,533;I had it myself for supper
638;00:52:17,764;00:52:20,533;only last night.
639;00:52:24,771;00:52:27,573;We did everything we could from the
639;00:52:24,771;00:52:27,573;moment they took your brother.
640;00:52:27,908;00:52:29,709;Tommen even went
640;00:52:27,908;00:52:29,709;to the sept himself
641;00:52:29,977;00:52:32,111;to confront the High Sparrow.
642;00:52:32,445;00:52:35,180;But I fear the Faith
642;00:52:32,445;00:52:35,180;has left reason behind.
643;00:52:35,415;00:52:38,250;I know you did this.
644;00:52:38,584;00:52:42,087;We are making every effort
644;00:52:38,584;00:52:42,087;on your behalf.
645;00:52:42,389;00:52:44,623;I swear to you
645;00:52:42,389;00:52:44,623;by all the seven gods.
646;00:52:44,891;00:52:46,758;Lies come easily to you.
647;00:52:46,993;00:52:48,427;Everyone knows that.
648;00:52:48,628;00:52:51,362;But innocence,
649;00:52:51,597;00:52:54,032;decency, concern,
650;00:52:54,400;00:52:56,801;you're not very good
650;00:52:54,400;00:52:56,801;at those, I'm afraid.
651;00:52:58,470;00:53:00,539;Perhaps that's why
651;00:52:58,470;00:53:00,539;your son was so eager
652;00:53:00,806;00:53:02,440;to cast you aside for me.
653;00:53:04,510;00:53:06,644;You're upset.
654;00:53:06,945;00:53:09,080;You're not thinking clearly.
655;00:53:09,481;00:53:11,642;I'll visit again when you've
655;00:53:09,481;00:53:11,642;had a chance to calm down.
656;00:53:11,650;00:53:13,384;I don't want to see you again.
657;00:53:13,752;00:53:15,653;I do hope you change
657;00:53:13,752;00:53:15,653;your mind about that.
658;00:53:15,954;00:53:18,356;I've been told men often go mad
659;00:53:18,657;00:53:20,958;in the Black Cells
659;00:53:18,657;00:53:20,958;beneath the Red Keep.
660;00:53:21,293;00:53:22,560;Though I suppose
660;00:53:21,293;00:53:22,560;your isolation will end
661;00:53:22,794;00:53:24,929;when your trial begins.
662;00:53:26,364;00:53:28,198;Leave.
663;00:53:28,366;00:53:30,034;Yes.
664;00:53:30,268;00:53:31,702;I'm afraid I must.
665;00:53:32,037;00:53:33,804;My son needs me now
665;00:53:32,037;00:53:33,804;more than ever.
666;00:53:34,105;00:53:36,440;Get out, you hateful bitch!
667;00:53:50,621;00:53:52,456;Sleep well, sister.
668;00:54:20,217;00:54:21,584;Thank you, Boake.
669;00:54:28,858;00:54:30,358;You saw her?
669;00:54:28,858;00:54:30,358;Yes.
670;00:54:30,727;00:54:33,128;And?
670;00:54:30,727;00:54:33,128;Her accommodations seem sufficient.
671;00:54:33,395;00:54:35,530;What happens to her now?
672;00:54:35,865;00:54:37,833;Well, she and her brother
672;00:54:35,865;00:54:37,833;are both being held
673;00:54:38,067;00:54:39,868;under fair suspicion.
674;00:54:40,169;00:54:42,303;A trial will be held
674;00:54:40,169;00:54:42,303;for each of them
675;00:54:42,605;00:54:45,440;to determine if they're
675;00:54:42,605;00:54:45,440;guilty of any acts
676;00:54:45,874;00:54:49,010;that might constitute a violation
676;00:54:45,874;00:54:49,010;of the tenets of the faith.
677;00:54:49,245;00:54:50,911;Who will stand judge?
678;00:54:51,347;00:54:55,082;Seven septons as it was in all
678;00:54:51,347;00:54:55,082;trials before the Targaryens.
679;00:54:56,718;00:54:57,678;Will you be one of them?
680;00:54:57,853;00:54:59,254;I will.
681;00:55:01,757;00:55:03,557;If one or both of them
682;00:55:03,892;00:55:06,127;were to confess
682;00:55:03,892;00:55:06,127;before the trial...
683;00:55:06,461;00:55:08,295;Then they will be shown
683;00:55:06,461;00:55:08,295;the Mother's mercy.
684;00:55:09,597;00:55:11,866;And what does
684;00:55:09,597;00:55:11,866;the Mother's mercy entail?
685;00:55:12,134;00:55:14,234;It depends upon the situation.
686;00:55:14,602;00:55:17,337;The acts themselves,
686;00:55:14,602;00:55:17,337;the degree of contrition.
687;00:55:17,605;00:55:20,307;Thank you, High Septon,
688;00:55:20,708;00:55:23,043;for bringing them whatever
688;00:55:20,708;00:55:23,043;justice they deserve
689;00:55:23,311;00:55:25,912;in the eyes of the Seven.
690;00:55:30,084;00:55:31,518;Did you know this chapel
691;00:55:31,919;00:55:34,253;is one of the oldest
691;00:55:31,919;00:55:34,253;structures in King's Landing?
692;00:55:36,057;00:55:38,224;I think I may have
692;00:55:36,057;00:55:38,224;heard at one point.
693;00:55:38,492;00:55:41,094;Baelor built his sept around it.
694;00:55:42,763;00:55:45,732;But men worshipped here
694;00:55:42,763;00:55:45,732;long before him.
695;00:55:45,966;00:55:48,501;Who carved this altar?
696;00:55:48,803;00:55:51,837;Do you know?
696;00:55:48,803;00:55:51,837;I'm afraid I don't.
697;00:55:52,005;00:55:54,139;No one does.
698;00:55:54,508;00:55:57,943;There's no name on it or
698;00:55:54,508;00:55:57,943;anywhere else in the chapel.
699;00:56:00,146;00:56:02,281;No, the people
699;00:56:00,146;00:56:02,281;who built this place
700;00:56:02,649;00:56:06,519;didn't inflict their vanity
700;00:56:02,649;00:56:06,519;on those who came after them
701;00:56:06,953;00:56:10,355;the way Baelor did with that great
701;00:56:06,953;00:56:10,355;gilded monstrosity up there.
702;00:56:10,523;00:56:12,091;Hmm.
703;00:56:12,325;00:56:14,326;Their faith was clean.
704;00:56:15,829;00:56:18,296;Strip away the gold
704;00:56:15,829;00:56:18,296;and the ornaments,
705;00:56:18,631;00:56:22,034;knock down the statues
705;00:56:18,631;00:56:22,034;and the pillars,
706;00:56:22,301;00:56:24,269;and this is what remains.
707;00:56:27,373;00:56:29,774;Something simple...
708;00:56:33,145;00:56:36,348;and solid and true.
709;00:56:41,053;00:56:44,055;The Tyrells' finery
709;00:56:41,053;00:56:44,055;will be stripped away.
710;00:56:45,490;00:56:47,158;Their lies knocked down.
711;00:56:47,525;00:56:50,194;Their true hearts
711;00:56:47,525;00:56:50,194;laid bare for all to see.
712;00:56:51,663;00:56:54,298;And so it will be for all of us.
713;00:56:54,532;00:56:56,900;High and low alike.
714;00:57:01,139;00:57:03,173;What will we find
715;00:57:03,475;00:57:06,209;when we strip away your finery?
716;00:57:09,681;00:57:12,916;A young man came to us
716;00:57:09,681;00:57:12,916;not long ago.
717;00:57:13,184;00:57:15,852;Broken in body and spirit.
718;00:57:18,189;00:57:20,257;He had so much to strip away.
719;00:57:22,326;00:57:25,862;So much weighing him down.
720;00:57:26,230;00:57:29,099;But piece by piece,
720;00:57:26,230;00:57:29,099;he unburdened himself.
721;00:57:30,768;00:57:32,635;Let go of vanity,
722;00:57:32,836;00:57:35,171;pride, sin.
723;00:57:37,908;00:57:40,310;Now his soul is so light,
724;00:57:40,711;00:57:43,546;he will float through the
724;00:57:40,711;00:57:43,546;Seven Heavens like a bird.
725;00:57:43,714;00:57:45,181;Hmm.
726;00:57:50,386;00:57:52,822;And he has much
726;00:57:50,386;00:57:52,822;to say about you.
727;00:58:17,112;00:58:18,714;Move.
728;00:58:20,950;00:58:23,351;Let me go immediately.
729;00:58:23,652;00:58:26,321;You will order her to let me go.
730;00:58:26,621;00:58:29,023;I am the queen!
730;00:58:26,621;00:58:29,023;I am the queen!
731;00:58:29,258;00:58:30,725;Have you lost your mind?
732;00:58:30,926;00:58:32,460;Let me go!
733;00:58:34,096;00:58:35,996;Get your filthy hands off me!
734;00:58:36,264;00:58:38,566;Have you lost your mind?
735;00:58:38,834;00:58:41,402;I am the queen!
735;00:58:38,834;00:58:41,402;Let me go!
736;00:58:47,676;00:58:49,343;Look at me.
737;00:58:52,013;00:58:53,347;Look at my face.
738;00:58:56,650;00:58:59,353;It's the last thing
738;00:58:56,650;00:58:59,353;you'll see before you die.
