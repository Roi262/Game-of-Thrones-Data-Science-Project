1;00:00:00,727;00:00:02,930;Still not far
﻿1;00:00:00,727;00:00:02,930;from Pentos, Your Grace.
2;00:00:02,968;00:00:04,320;You'd be more
2;00:00:02,968;00:00:04,320;comfortable there.
3;00:00:04,440;00:00:06,807;I have no interest
3;00:00:04,440;00:00:06,807;in hospitality or comfort.
4;00:00:06,842;00:00:08,642;I'll stay with Drogo
4;00:00:06,842;00:00:08,642;until he fulfills
5;00:00:08,676;00:00:11,276;his end of the bargain
5;00:00:08,676;00:00:11,276;and I have my crown.
6;00:00:11,311;00:00:13,046;I have something for you.
7;00:00:13,080;00:00:15,981;First lesson: Stick them
7;00:00:13,080;00:00:15,981;with the pointy end.
8;00:00:16,016;00:00:20,252;17 years ago you rode off
8;00:00:16,016;00:00:20,252;with Robert Baratheon.
9;00:00:20,286;00:00:23,988;And now you're leaving again.
9;00:00:20,286;00:00:23,988;I have no choice.
10;00:00:24,022;00:00:26,389;There's great honor serving
10;00:00:24,022;00:00:26,389;in the Night's Watch.
11;00:00:26,424;00:00:28,958;The Starks have manned the
11;00:00:26,424;00:00:28,958;Wall for thousands of years.
12;00:00:28,992;00:00:30,626;And you are a Stark.
13;00:00:30,661;00:00:33,931;Daenerys Targaryen has wed
13;00:00:30,661;00:00:33,931;some Dothraki horselord.
14;00:00:33,966;00:00:36,500;What of it?
14;00:00:33,966;00:00:36,500;Tell me we're not speaking of this.
15;00:00:36,535;00:00:39,937;I'll kill every Targaryen
15;00:00:36,535;00:00:39,937;I get my hands on.
16;00:00:39,972;00:00:43,641;Rapers. Not impressed
16;00:00:39,972;00:00:43,641;by your new brothers?
17;00:00:43,675;00:00:45,543;Lovely thing about the watch--
18;00:00:45,577;00:00:49,112;You discard your old family
18;00:00:45,577;00:00:49,112;and get a whole new one.
19;00:00:49,147;00:00:50,947;Welcome.
20;00:00:50,982;00:00:53,517;I don't think Bran
20;00:00:50,982;00:00:53,517;fell from that tower.
21;00:00:53,551;00:00:55,852;I think he was thrown.
21;00:00:53,551;00:00:55,852;No!
22;00:00:55,886;00:00:58,721;Someone tried
22;00:00:55,886;00:00:58,721;to kill him twice.
23;00:00:58,755;00:01:01,189;I would stake my life
23;00:00:58,755;00:01:01,189;the Lannisters are involved.
24;00:01:01,224;00:01:05,293;Lord Stark must be told of this.
24;00:01:01,224;00:01:05,293;I will go myself.
25;00:01:05,327;00:01:07,227;What is the meaning of this?
26;00:01:07,262;00:01:09,230;Joff told us what happened.
27;00:01:09,264;00:01:12,700;You and that boy beat him with clubs while
27;00:01:09,264;00:01:12,700;you set your wolf on him.
28;00:01:12,734;00:01:14,535;That's not what happened!
29;00:01:14,570;00:01:15,703;Ahh!
30;00:01:15,738;00:01:18,173;We found no trace of the
30;00:01:15,738;00:01:18,173;direwolf, Your Grace.
31;00:01:18,207;00:01:21,244;We have another wolf.
31;00:01:18,207;00:01:21,244;As you will.
32;00:01:21,278;00:01:23,112;He doesn't mean Lady, does he?
33;00:01:23,147;00:01:25,749;Lady didn't bite anyone!
33;00:01:23,147;00:01:25,749;She's good!

35;00:03:43,248;00:03:45,115;Welcome, Lord Stark.
36;00:03:45,150;00:03:47,984;Grand Maester Pycelle has called
36;00:03:45,150;00:03:47,984;a meeting of the small council.
37;00:03:48,019;00:03:50,119;The honor of your
37;00:03:48,019;00:03:50,119;presence is requested.
38;00:03:51,621;00:03:54,724;Get the girls settled in.
38;00:03:51,621;00:03:54,724;I'll be back in time for supper.
39;00:03:54,758;00:03:57,393;And, Jory, you go with them.
39;00:03:54,758;00:03:57,393;Yes, My Lord.
40;00:03:57,428;00:04:01,164;If you'd like to change into
40;00:03:57,428;00:04:01,164;something more appropriate...
41;00:04:37,335;00:04:39,670;Thank the gods
41;00:04:37,335;00:04:39,670;you're here, Stark.
42;00:04:40,638;00:04:44,163;About time we had some stern
42;00:04:40,638;00:04:44,163;northern leadership.
43;00:04:45,076;00:04:46,777;About glad to see you're
43;00:04:45,076;00:04:46,777;protecting the throne.
44;00:04:46,811;00:04:48,845;Sturdy old thing.
45;00:04:48,880;00:04:51,348;How many kings' asses
45;00:04:48,880;00:04:51,348;have polished it, I wonder?
46;00:04:51,383;00:04:53,383;Um, what's the line?
47;00:04:53,418;00:04:56,521;The King shits
47;00:04:53,418;00:04:56,521;and the Hand wipes.
48;00:04:56,555;00:05:00,025;Very handsome armor.
49;00:05:00,059;00:05:02,461;Not a scratch on it.
49;00:05:00,059;00:05:02,461;I know.
50;00:05:02,495;00:05:06,032;People have been swinging at me for
50;00:05:02,495;00:05:06,032;years, but they always seem to miss.
51;00:05:06,066;00:05:08,935;You've chosen your
51;00:05:06,066;00:05:08,935;opponents wisely then.
52;00:05:10,171;00:05:12,206;I have a knack for it.
53;00:05:15,343;00:05:18,478;It must be strange for you
53;00:05:15,343;00:05:18,478;coming into this room.
54;00:05:20,748;00:05:23,717;I was standing right here
54;00:05:20,748;00:05:23,717;when it happened.
55;00:05:24,719;00:05:26,786;He was very brave,
55;00:05:24,719;00:05:26,786;your brother.
56;00:05:26,821;00:05:28,622;Your father too.
57;00:05:28,656;00:05:30,790;They didn't deserve
57;00:05:28,656;00:05:30,790;to die like that.
58;00:05:30,825;00:05:33,693;Nobody deserves
58;00:05:30,825;00:05:33,693;to die like that.
59;00:05:33,728;00:05:35,595;But you just stood there
59;00:05:33,728;00:05:35,595;and watched.
60;00:05:35,630;00:05:38,599;500 men just stood there
60;00:05:35,630;00:05:38,599;and watched.
61;00:05:38,633;00:05:41,402;All the great knights
61;00:05:38,633;00:05:41,402;of the Seven Kingdoms--
62;00:05:41,436;00:05:43,837;You think anyone said a
62;00:05:41,436;00:05:43,837;word, lifted a finger?
63;00:05:43,872;00:05:46,473;No, Lord Stark.
64;00:05:46,508;00:05:51,111;500 men and this room
64;00:05:46,508;00:05:51,111;was silent as a crypt.
65;00:05:52,780;00:05:55,249;Except for the screams,
65;00:05:52,780;00:05:55,249;of course,
66;00:05:55,283;00:05:58,118;and the Mad King laughing.
67;00:05:58,153;00:06:00,888;And later...
68;00:06:00,922;00:06:03,556;When I watched
68;00:06:00,922;00:06:03,556;the Mad King die,
69;00:06:03,590;00:06:06,959;I remembered him laughing
69;00:06:03,590;00:06:06,959;as your father burned...
70;00:06:08,262;00:06:09,929;It felt like justice.
71;00:06:12,933;00:06:15,601;Is that what you
71;00:06:12,933;00:06:15,601;tell yourself at night?
72;00:06:16,670;00:06:19,406;You're a servant of justice?
73;00:06:19,440;00:06:21,508;That you were avenging
73;00:06:19,440;00:06:21,508;my father when you
74;00:06:21,543;00:06:24,112;shoved your sword in
74;00:06:21,543;00:06:24,112;Aerys Targaryen's back?
75;00:06:24,146;00:06:25,914;Tell me--
76;00:06:25,949;00:06:28,984;If I'd stabbed the Mad King in
76;00:06:25,949;00:06:28,984;the belly instead of the back,
77;00:06:29,019;00:06:31,588;would you admire me more?
78;00:06:31,622;00:06:34,157;You served him well
79;00:06:34,191;00:06:37,127;when serving was safe.
80;00:06:48,974;00:06:51,209;Lord Stark.
81;00:06:53,645;00:06:55,446;Lord Varys.
82;00:06:55,481;00:06:58,849;I was grievously sorry to hear of
82;00:06:55,481;00:06:58,849;your troubles on the Kingsroad.
83;00:06:58,884;00:07:02,519;We are all praying for prince
83;00:06:58,884;00:07:02,519;Joffrey's full recovery.
84;00:07:02,554;00:07:05,989;A shame you didn't say a
84;00:07:02,554;00:07:05,989;prayer for the butcher's son.
85;00:07:07,124;00:07:10,426;Renly!
85;00:07:07,124;00:07:10,426;You're looking well.
86;00:07:10,460;00:07:12,228;And you look
86;00:07:10,460;00:07:12,228;tired from the road.
87;00:07:12,262;00:07:14,430;I told them this meeting
87;00:07:12,262;00:07:14,430;could wait another day, but--
88;00:07:14,464;00:07:17,233;But we have a kingdom
88;00:07:14,464;00:07:17,233;to look after.
89;00:07:17,267;00:07:20,536;I've hoped to meet you
89;00:07:17,267;00:07:20,536;for some time, Lord Stark.
90;00:07:20,570;00:07:24,173;No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
90;00:07:20,570;00:07:24,173;She has, Lord Baelish.
91;00:07:24,207;00:07:27,276;I understand you knew
91;00:07:24,207;00:07:27,276;my brother Brandon as well.
92;00:07:27,310;00:07:30,546;All too well.
92;00:07:27,310;00:07:30,546;I still carry a token of his esteem
93;00:07:30,580;00:07:32,549;from navel to collarbone.
94;00:07:32,583;00:07:34,651;Perhaps you chose
94;00:07:32,583;00:07:34,651;the wrong man to duel with.
95;00:07:34,685;00:07:36,653;It wasn't the man
95;00:07:34,685;00:07:36,653;that I chose, My Lord.
96;00:07:36,687;00:07:39,056;It was Catelyn Tully.
97;00:07:39,091;00:07:42,427;A woman worth fighting for,
97;00:07:39,091;00:07:42,427;I'm sure you'll agree.
98;00:07:42,461;00:07:45,130;I humbly beg your pardon,
98;00:07:42,461;00:07:45,130;my Lord Stark.
99;00:07:45,164;00:07:47,800;Grand Maester.
100;00:07:47,834;00:07:50,036;How many years has it been?
101;00:07:50,071;00:07:53,740;You were a young man.
101;00:07:50,071;00:07:53,740;And you served another King.
102;00:07:55,543;00:07:58,311;Oh, how forgetful of me.
103;00:07:59,881;00:08:02,181;This belongs to you, now.
104;00:08:04,819;00:08:06,553;Should we begin?
105;00:08:07,755;00:08:09,623;Without the King?
105;00:08:07,755;00:08:09,623;Winter may be coming,
106;00:08:09,657;00:08:12,960;but I'm afraid the same cannot
106;00:08:09,657;00:08:12,960;be said for my brother.
107;00:08:12,994;00:08:15,061;His Grace has many cares.
108;00:08:15,096;00:08:18,097;He entrusts some
108;00:08:15,096;00:08:18,097;small matters to us
109;00:08:18,131;00:08:19,932;that we might lighten the load.
110;00:08:19,967;00:08:22,868;We are the lords
110;00:08:19,967;00:08:22,868;of small matters here.
111;00:08:27,840;00:08:30,308;My brother instructs us
111;00:08:27,840;00:08:30,308;to stage a tournament
112;00:08:30,343;00:08:33,178;in honor of Lord Stark's
112;00:08:30,343;00:08:33,178;appointment as Hand of the King.
113;00:08:33,212;00:08:36,882;Mmm, how much?
113;00:08:33,212;00:08:36,882;40,000 gold dragons to the champion,
114;00:08:36,916;00:08:38,617;20,000 to the runner-up,
115;00:08:38,652;00:08:41,787;20,000 to the winning archer.
116;00:08:41,822;00:08:44,124;Can the treasury bear
116;00:08:41,822;00:08:44,124;such expense?
117;00:08:44,159;00:08:47,094;I'll have to borrow it.
117;00:08:44,159;00:08:47,094;The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect.
118;00:08:47,128;00:08:50,064;We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold.
118;00:08:47,128;00:08:50,064;What's another 80,000?
119;00:08:50,098;00:08:52,232;Are you telling me the Crown
119;00:08:50,098;00:08:52,232;is three million in debt?
120;00:08:52,267;00:08:54,334;I'm telling you the Crown
120;00:08:52,267;00:08:54,334;is six million in debt.
121;00:08:54,368;00:08:56,269;How could you let this happen?
122;00:08:56,303;00:08:58,070;The Master of Coin
122;00:08:56,303;00:08:58,070;finds the money.
123;00:08:58,105;00:09:00,539;The King and the Hand spend it.
124;00:09:00,574;00:09:02,308;I will not believe Jon Arryn
125;00:09:02,342;00:09:04,143;allowed Robert
125;00:09:02,342;00:09:04,143;to bankrupt the realm.
126;00:09:04,177;00:09:07,146;Lord Arryn gave wise
126;00:09:04,177;00:09:07,146;and prudent advice,
127;00:09:07,180;00:09:09,448;but I fear His Grace
128;00:09:09,482;00:09:13,385;doesn't always listen.
128;00:09:09,482;00:09:13,385;Counting coppers, he calls it.
129;00:09:13,419;00:09:15,787;I'll speak to him tomorrow.
130;00:09:15,822;00:09:18,690;This tournament is an
130;00:09:15,822;00:09:18,690;extravagance we cannot afford.
131;00:09:18,724;00:09:21,092;As you will.
131;00:09:18,724;00:09:21,092;But still, we'd best make our plans.
132;00:09:21,126;00:09:23,260;There will be no plans
133;00:09:23,294;00:09:25,629;until I speak to Robert.
134;00:09:29,166;00:09:31,167;Forgive me, my Lords.
134;00:09:29,166;00:09:31,167;I'm--
135;00:09:31,201;00:09:34,871;I had a long ride.
135;00:09:31,201;00:09:34,871;You are the King's Hand,
136;00:09:34,906;00:09:38,475;Lord Stark, we serve
136;00:09:34,906;00:09:38,475;at your pleasure.
137;00:09:45,118;00:09:47,586;Ow!
137;00:09:45,118;00:09:47,586;Please, it's nearly healed.
138;00:09:50,023;00:09:53,426;It's ugly.
138;00:09:50,023;00:09:53,426;A King should have scars
139;00:09:53,460;00:09:57,263;you fought off a direwolf.
139;00:09:53,460;00:09:57,263;You're a warrior like your father.
140;00:09:57,297;00:09:59,599;I'm not like him.
140;00:09:57,297;00:09:59,599;I didn't fight off anything.
141;00:09:59,633;00:10:01,635;It bit me and all
141;00:09:59,633;00:10:01,635;I did was scream.
142;00:10:01,669;00:10:03,937;And the two Stark girls
142;00:10:01,669;00:10:03,937;saw it, both of them.
143;00:10:03,971;00:10:07,041;That's not true.
143;00:10:03,971;00:10:07,041;You killed the beast.
144;00:10:07,075;00:10:10,277;You only spared the girl because of the
144;00:10:07,075;00:10:10,277;love your father bears her father.
145;00:10:10,311;00:10:11,138;I didn't, I--
146;00:10:11,258;00:10:13,328;When Aerys Targaryen
146;00:10:11,258;00:10:13,328;sat on the Iron Throne,
147;00:10:13,448;00:10:15,916;your father was a rebel
147;00:10:13,448;00:10:15,916;and a traitor.
148;00:10:15,950;00:10:20,320;Someday you'll sit on the throne and
148;00:10:15,950;00:10:20,320;the truth will be what you make it.
149;00:10:23,923;00:10:25,790;Do I have to marry her?
150;00:10:25,825;00:10:27,625;Yes.
151;00:10:28,927;00:10:31,028;She's very beautiful and young.
152;00:10:31,062;00:10:34,298;If you don't like her, you only
152;00:10:31,062;00:10:34,298;need to see her on formal occasions
153;00:10:34,333;00:10:38,235;and when the time comes, to make
153;00:10:34,333;00:10:38,235;little princes and princesses.
154;00:10:39,872;00:10:43,408;And if you'd rather fuck painted
154;00:10:39,872;00:10:43,408;whores, you'll fuck painted whores.
155;00:10:43,442;00:10:46,544;And if you'd rather lie with
155;00:10:43,442;00:10:46,544;noble virgins, so be it.
156;00:10:46,578;00:10:48,612;You are my darling boy
156;00:10:46,578;00:10:48,612;and the world will be
157;00:10:48,647;00:10:50,881;exactly as you want it to be.
158;00:10:54,053;00:10:56,354;Do something nice
158;00:10:54,053;00:10:56,354;for the Stark girl.
159;00:10:56,388;00:10:58,657;I don't want to.
159;00:10:56,388;00:10:58,657;No, but you will.
160;00:10:58,691;00:11:02,761;The occasional kindness will spare you
160;00:10:58,691;00:11:02,761;all sorts of trouble down the road.
161;00:11:03,897;00:11:05,831;We allow the northerners
161;00:11:03,897;00:11:05,831;too much power.
162;00:11:05,866;00:11:08,234;They consider themselves
162;00:11:05,866;00:11:08,234;our equals.
163;00:11:08,268;00:11:10,403;How would you handle them?
164;00:11:10,437;00:11:12,605;I'd double their taxes
165;00:11:12,639;00:11:16,141;and command them to supply
165;00:11:12,639;00:11:16,141;10,000 men to the royal army.
166;00:11:16,175;00:11:19,444;A royal army?
166;00:11:16,175;00:11:19,444;Why should every lord command his own men?
167;00:11:19,478;00:11:21,812;It's primitive, no better
167;00:11:19,478;00:11:21,812;than the hill tribes.
168;00:11:21,847;00:11:24,782;We should have a standing army
168;00:11:21,847;00:11:24,782;of men loyal to the Crown,
169;00:11:24,816;00:11:26,650;trained by
169;00:11:24,816;00:11:26,650;experienced soldiers--
170;00:11:26,685;00:11:30,287;Instead of a mob of peasants who've
170;00:11:26,685;00:11:30,287;never held pikes in their lives.
171;00:11:30,321;00:11:32,889;And if the northerners rebel?
172;00:11:32,923;00:11:34,558;I'd crush them.
173;00:11:34,592;00:11:37,294;Seize Winterfell and install
173;00:11:34,592;00:11:37,294;someone loyal to the realm
174;00:11:37,328;00:11:40,263;as Warden of the North.
174;00:11:37,328;00:11:40,263;Uncle Kevan, maybe.
175;00:11:40,298;00:11:43,967;And these 10,000 northern troops, would
175;00:11:40,298;00:11:43,967;they fight for you or their lord?
176;00:11:44,001;00:11:46,436;For me. I'm their King.
176;00:11:44,001;00:11:46,436;Mm-hmm.
177;00:11:46,470;00:11:48,571;But you've just
177;00:11:46,470;00:11:48,571;invaded their homeland,
178;00:11:48,605;00:11:51,373;asked them to kill their brothers.
178;00:11:48,605;00:11:51,373;I'm not asking.
179;00:11:51,408;00:11:54,410;The North cannot be held--
179;00:11:51,408;00:11:54,410;not by an outsider.
180;00:11:54,444;00:11:57,079;It's too big and too wild.
180;00:11:54,444;00:11:57,079;And when the winter comes,
181;00:11:57,113;00:12:00,449;the seven gods together couldn't
181;00:11:57,113;00:12:00,449;save you and your royal army.
182;00:12:00,483;00:12:03,451;A good King knows
182;00:12:00,483;00:12:03,451;when to save his strength...
183;00:12:04,954;00:12:07,288;And when to destroy
183;00:12:04,954;00:12:07,288;his enemies.
184;00:12:07,322;00:12:10,057;So you agree...
185;00:12:10,091;00:12:12,493;The Starks are enemies?
186;00:12:14,496;00:12:17,231;Everyone who isn't us
187;00:12:17,266;00:12:19,267;is an enemy.
188;00:12:21,537;00:12:24,139;Enough of that, young lady.
188;00:12:21,537;00:12:24,139;Eat your food.
189;00:12:24,174;00:12:26,075;I'm practicing.
189;00:12:24,174;00:12:26,075;Practicing for what?
190;00:12:26,110;00:12:28,177;The prince.
190;00:12:26,110;00:12:28,177;Arya, stop!
191;00:12:28,212;00:12:31,381;He's a liar and a coward
191;00:12:28,212;00:12:31,381;and he killed my friend.
192;00:12:31,415;00:12:33,208;The Hound killed your friend.
193;00:12:33,328;00:12:35,266;The Hound does whatever
193;00:12:33,328;00:12:35,266;the prince tells him to do.
194;00:12:35,386;00:12:37,988;You're an idiot.
194;00:12:35,386;00:12:37,988;You're a liar, and if you told the truth
195;00:12:38,022;00:12:40,724;Mycah would be alive.
195;00:12:38,022;00:12:40,724;Enough!
196;00:12:42,326;00:12:44,027;What's happening here?
197;00:12:44,061;00:12:47,363;Arya would rather act
197;00:12:44,061;00:12:47,363;like a beast than a lady.
198;00:12:49,032;00:12:51,367;Go to your room.
198;00:12:49,032;00:12:51,367;We'll speak later.
199;00:12:59,211;00:13:02,179;That's for you, love.
200;00:13:10,490;00:13:13,425;The same dollmaker makes all
200;00:13:10,490;00:13:13,425;of Princess Myrcella's toys.
201;00:13:16,162;00:13:18,264;Don't you like it?
202;00:13:18,298;00:13:21,201;I haven't played with dolls
202;00:13:18,298;00:13:21,201;since I was eight.
203;00:13:22,637;00:13:25,372;May I be excused?
203;00:13:22,637;00:13:25,372;You've barely eaten a thing.
204;00:13:26,575;00:13:29,077;It's all right.
204;00:13:26,575;00:13:29,077;Go on.
205;00:13:38,286;00:13:40,720;War was easier than daughters.
206;00:13:44,824;00:13:47,425;Go away!
207;00:13:47,460;00:13:50,027;Arya, open the door.
208;00:13:59,971;00:14:02,272;May I come in?
209;00:14:08,679;00:14:11,414;Whose sword is that?
209;00:14:08,679;00:14:11,414;Mine.
210;00:14:11,449;00:14:13,283;Give it to me.
211;00:14:19,958;00:14:22,894;I know this maker's mark.
211;00:14:19,958;00:14:22,894;This is Mikken's work.
212;00:14:24,998;00:14:26,832;Where did you get this?
213;00:14:30,738;00:14:32,972;This is no toy.
214;00:14:34,841;00:14:37,776;Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
214;00:14:34,841;00:14:37,776;I wasn't playing.
215;00:14:37,810;00:14:39,744;And I don't want to be a lady.
216;00:14:39,778;00:14:42,179;Come here.
217;00:14:47,419;00:14:49,753;Now what do you want with this?
218;00:14:49,787;00:14:51,688;It's called Needle.
219;00:14:51,722;00:14:54,358;Oh, a blade with a name.
220;00:14:55,593;00:14:58,295;And who were you hoping
220;00:14:55,593;00:14:58,295;to skewer with Needle?
221;00:14:58,329;00:15:00,064;Your sister?
222;00:15:00,098;00:15:02,466;Do you know the first thing
222;00:15:00,098;00:15:02,466;about sword fighting?
223;00:15:02,500;00:15:04,268;Stick 'em with the pointy end.
224;00:15:04,302;00:15:07,304;That's the essence of it.
225;00:15:09,941;00:15:12,176;I was trying to learn.
226;00:15:13,912;00:15:16,781;I asked Mycah
226;00:15:13,912;00:15:16,781;to practice with me.
227;00:15:18,451;00:15:20,253;I asked him.
228;00:15:21,455;00:15:24,157;It was my fault.
228;00:15:21,455;00:15:24,157;No, sweet girl.
229;00:15:24,191;00:15:27,694;No no, you didn't kill
229;00:15:24,191;00:15:27,694;the butcher's boy.
230;00:15:28,896;00:15:32,132;I hate them!
230;00:15:28,896;00:15:32,132;I hate all of them.
231;00:15:32,166;00:15:34,768;The Hound, the Queen
231;00:15:32,166;00:15:34,768;and the King
232;00:15:34,802;00:15:36,309;and Joffrey and Sansa.
233;00:15:36,429;00:15:39,955;Sansa was dragged before
233;00:15:36,429;00:15:39,955;the King and Queen...
234;00:15:40,075;00:15:42,709;And asked to call
234;00:15:40,075;00:15:42,709;the prince a liar.
235;00:15:42,744;00:15:45,245;So was I!
235;00:15:42,744;00:15:45,245;He is a liar.
236;00:15:45,280;00:15:47,381;Shh, darling, listen to me.
237;00:15:48,850;00:15:51,886;Sansa will be married
237;00:15:48,850;00:15:51,886;to Joffrey's someday.
238;00:15:51,920;00:15:54,222;She cannot betray him.
239;00:15:54,256;00:15:57,092;She must take his side
239;00:15:54,256;00:15:57,092;even when he's wrong.
240;00:15:58,361;00:16:01,030;But how you can let her
240;00:15:58,361;00:16:01,030;marry someone like that?
241;00:16:02,933;00:16:04,834;Well.
242;00:16:06,437;00:16:08,939;Look at me.
243;00:16:08,973;00:16:12,242;You're a Stark of Winterfell.
243;00:16:08,973;00:16:12,242;You know our words.
244;00:16:14,378;00:16:15,812;Winter is coming.
245;00:16:17,113;00:16:19,515;You were born
245;00:16:17,113;00:16:19,515;in the long summer.
246;00:16:19,549;00:16:21,650;You've never known
246;00:16:19,549;00:16:21,650;anything else.
247;00:16:21,684;00:16:23,718;But now winter is truly coming.
248;00:16:23,753;00:16:26,654;And in the winter,
248;00:16:23,753;00:16:26,654;we must protect ourselves,
249;00:16:26,688;00:16:31,125;look after one another.
249;00:16:26,688;00:16:31,125;Sansa is your sister.
250;00:16:32,360;00:16:34,729;I don't hate her.
251;00:16:34,763;00:16:36,931;Not really.
252;00:16:38,199;00:16:40,167;I don't want to frighten you,
253;00:16:40,202;00:16:42,036;but I won't lie to you either.
254;00:16:42,070;00:16:44,472;We've come
254;00:16:42,070;00:16:44,472;to a dangerous place.
255;00:16:44,506;00:16:48,143;We cannot fight a war
255;00:16:44,506;00:16:48,143;amongst ourselves.
256;00:16:49,045;00:16:51,046;All right?
257;00:16:51,080;00:16:55,016;Go on.
257;00:16:51,080;00:16:55,016;It's yours.
258;00:16:57,520;00:16:59,420;I can keep it?
259;00:16:59,454;00:17:02,623;Try not to stab
259;00:16:59,454;00:17:02,623;your sister with it.
260;00:17:11,197;00:17:13,565;If you're going to own a sword,
261;00:17:13,600;00:17:15,467;you'd better
261;00:17:13,600;00:17:15,467;know how to use it.
262;00:17:23,274;00:17:26,909;Don't listen to it.
262;00:17:23,274;00:17:26,909;Crows are all liars.
263;00:17:29,146;00:17:32,748;I know a story about a crow.
263;00:17:29,146;00:17:32,748;I hate your stories.
264;00:17:32,783;00:17:36,620;I know a story about a boy
264;00:17:32,783;00:17:36,620;who hated stories.
265;00:17:36,654;00:17:40,024;I could tell you about
265;00:17:36,654;00:17:40,024;Ser Duncan the Tall.
266;00:17:40,058;00:17:42,026;Those were always
266;00:17:40,058;00:17:42,026;your favorites.
267;00:17:42,061;00:17:44,429;Those weren't my favorites.
268;00:17:44,463;00:17:47,099;My favorites were
268;00:17:44,463;00:17:47,099;the scary ones.
269;00:17:48,502;00:17:52,705;Oh, my sweet summer child.
269;00:17:48,502;00:17:52,705;What do you know about fear?
270;00:17:54,174;00:17:55,975;Fear is for the winter,
271;00:17:56,010;00:17:58,979;when the snows fall
271;00:17:56,010;00:17:58,979;a hundred feet deep.
272;00:17:59,013;00:18:01,115;Fear is for the long night,
273;00:18:01,149;00:18:04,118;when the sun hides for years
274;00:18:04,152;00:18:06,888;and children are born
274;00:18:04,152;00:18:06,888;and live and die
275;00:18:06,923;00:18:09,624;all in darkness.
276;00:18:09,659;00:18:12,694;That is the time for fear,
276;00:18:09,659;00:18:12,694;my little Lord,
277;00:18:12,729;00:18:16,064;when the white walkers
277;00:18:12,729;00:18:16,064;move through the woods.
278;00:18:17,433;00:18:20,602;Thousands of years ago
278;00:18:17,433;00:18:20,602;there came a night
279;00:18:20,637;00:18:22,738;that lasted a generation.
280;00:18:22,772;00:18:25,708;Kings froze to death
280;00:18:22,772;00:18:25,708;in their castles,
281;00:18:25,742;00:18:27,976;same as the shepherds
281;00:18:25,742;00:18:27,976;in their huts.
282;00:18:28,011;00:18:30,880;And women smothered
282;00:18:28,011;00:18:30,880;their babies
283;00:18:30,914;00:18:33,049;rather than see them starve,
284;00:18:33,083;00:18:37,086;and wept and felt the tears
284;00:18:33,083;00:18:37,086;freeze on their cheeks.
285;00:18:37,121;00:18:40,824;So is this the sort
285;00:18:37,121;00:18:40,824;of story that you like?
286;00:18:43,862;00:18:45,963;In that darkness,
287;00:18:45,998;00:18:48,500;the White Walkers
287;00:18:45,998;00:18:48,500;came for the first time.
288;00:18:48,534;00:18:51,669;They swept through cities
288;00:18:48,534;00:18:51,669;and kingdoms,
289;00:18:51,704;00:18:53,871;riding their dead horses,
290;00:18:53,905;00:18:57,841;hunting with their packs of
290;00:18:53,905;00:18:57,841;pale spiders big as hounds--
291;00:19:02,059;00:19:04,406;What are you telling him now?
292;00:19:04,526;00:19:06,615;Only what what are the little
292;00:19:04,526;00:19:06,615;lord wants to hear.
293;00:19:06,650;00:19:11,885;Get your supper.
293;00:19:06,650;00:19:11,885;I want some time with him.
294;00:19:19,896;00:19:22,298;One time she told me
295;00:19:22,332;00:19:24,601;the sky is blue because
295;00:19:22,332;00:19:24,601;we live inside the eye
296;00:19:24,635;00:19:27,470;of a blue-eyed giant
296;00:19:24,635;00:19:27,470;named Macomber.
297;00:19:27,505;00:19:29,739;Maybe we do.
298;00:19:32,075;00:19:34,410;How do you feel?
299;00:19:37,780;00:19:39,914;You still don't
299;00:19:37,780;00:19:39,914;remember anything?
300;00:19:41,851;00:19:43,852;Bran,
301;00:19:43,886;00:19:46,053;I've seen you climb
301;00:19:43,886;00:19:46,053;a thousand times.
302;00:19:46,088;00:19:47,955;In the wind, in the rain--
303;00:19:47,990;00:19:50,090;A thousand times.
304;00:19:50,124;00:19:52,492;You never fall.
304;00:19:50,124;00:19:52,492;I did though.
305;00:19:55,463;00:19:57,730;It's true, isn't it,
306;00:19:57,765;00:20:01,101;what Maester Luwin
306;00:19:57,765;00:20:01,101;says about my legs?
307;00:20:08,576;00:20:10,611;I'd rather be dead.
308;00:20:11,913;00:20:15,117;Don't ever say that.
308;00:20:11,913;00:20:15,117;I'd rather be dead.
309;00:20:26,764;00:20:29,400;Fewer eyes back here, My Lady.
310;00:20:29,434;00:20:31,435;But still too many.
311;00:20:31,469;00:20:34,104;It's nine years since I've
311;00:20:31,469;00:20:34,104;set foot in the capital.
312;00:20:34,138;00:20:37,507;And no one knew who I was the
312;00:20:34,138;00:20:37,507;last time I came either.
313;00:20:41,044;00:20:43,545;My Lady.
314;00:20:43,580;00:20:46,848;Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
314;00:20:43,580;00:20:46,848;Would you mind following us?
315;00:20:46,883;00:20:48,749;I would.
315;00:20:46,883;00:20:48,749;We've done nothing wrong.
316;00:20:48,784;00:20:51,085;We've been instructed to
316;00:20:48,784;00:20:51,085;escort you into the city.
317;00:20:51,120;00:20:52,920;Instructed?
318;00:20:52,955;00:20:55,657;I don't know who's providing
318;00:20:52,955;00:20:55,657;your instructions, but--
319;00:20:55,691;00:20:57,425;Follow me, Lady Stark.
320;00:21:08,338;00:21:11,141;Cat!
320;00:21:08,338;00:21:11,141;Go on.
321;00:21:11,175;00:21:13,009;Go upstairs.
322;00:21:15,213;00:21:17,914;You little worm!
323;00:21:17,949;00:21:20,717;You take me for some
323;00:21:17,949;00:21:20,717;back-alley Sally
324;00:21:20,752;00:21:22,185;you can drag into a--
325;00:21:24,089;00:21:25,689;Pssst!
326;00:21:27,725;00:21:29,760;I meant no disrespect
327;00:21:29,794;00:21:32,162;to you of all people.
328;00:21:32,196;00:21:34,330;How dare you bring me here!
329;00:21:34,365;00:21:36,165;Have you lost your mind?
330;00:21:36,200;00:21:38,835;No one will come looking for you here.
330;00:21:36,200;00:21:38,835;Isn't that what you wanted?
331;00:21:38,869;00:21:42,405;I'm truly sorry
331;00:21:38,869;00:21:42,405;about the locale.
332;00:21:42,439;00:21:44,908;How did you know I was
332;00:21:42,439;00:21:44,908;coming to King's Landing?
333;00:21:46,010;00:21:48,011;A dear friend told me.
334;00:21:49,646;00:21:52,481;Lady Stark.
334;00:21:49,646;00:21:52,481;Lord Varys.
335;00:21:52,516;00:21:56,518;To see you again after so
335;00:21:52,516;00:21:56,518;many years is a blessing.
336;00:21:56,553;00:21:58,053;Your poor hands.
337;00:22:00,489;00:22:02,090;How did you know I was coming?
338;00:22:02,124;00:22:04,592;Knowledge is my trade, My Lady.
339;00:22:06,394;00:22:08,929;Did you bring the dagger
339;00:22:06,394;00:22:08,929;with you, by any chance?
340;00:22:10,531;00:22:12,932;My little birds
340;00:22:10,531;00:22:12,932;are everywhere...
341;00:22:12,966;00:22:15,201;Even in the north.
342;00:22:15,235;00:22:18,771;They whisper to me
342;00:22:15,235;00:22:18,771;the strangest stories.
343;00:22:24,177;00:22:26,245;Valyrian steel.
344;00:22:26,279;00:22:29,048;Do you know whose dagger
344;00:22:26,279;00:22:29,048;this is?
345;00:22:30,250;00:22:32,485;I must admit I do not.
346;00:22:32,519;00:22:36,388;Well well, this is an historic day.
347;00:22:36,423;00:22:38,524;Something you don't know
348;00:22:38,558;00:22:41,026;that I do.
349;00:22:42,995;00:22:46,865;There's only one dagger like this
349;00:22:42,995;00:22:46,865;in all of the Seven Kingdoms.
350;00:22:48,301;00:22:50,869;It's mine.
350;00:22:48,301;00:22:50,869;Yours?
351;00:22:50,903;00:22:55,473;At least it was, until the tournament
351;00:22:50,903;00:22:55,473;on Prince Joffrey's last nameday.
352;00:22:55,508;00:22:58,343;I bet on Ser Jaime
352;00:22:55,508;00:22:58,343;in the jousting,
353;00:22:58,377;00:23:00,179;as any sane man would.
354;00:23:00,213;00:23:02,714;When the Knight of the
354;00:23:00,213;00:23:02,714;Glowers unseated him,
355;00:23:02,749;00:23:05,318;I lost this dagger.
356;00:23:05,352;00:23:07,520;To whom?
357;00:23:07,554;00:23:09,422;Tyrion Lannister.
358;00:23:09,457;00:23:11,625;The Imp.
359;00:23:11,659;00:23:14,461;Grenn, show him what
359;00:23:11,659;00:23:14,461;you farm boys are made of.
360;00:23:19,834;00:23:22,802;If that were a real sword, you'd be dead.
361;00:23:22,837;00:23:26,105;Lord Snow here
361;00:23:22,837;00:23:26,105;grew up in a castle
362;00:23:26,140;00:23:28,441;spitting down
362;00:23:26,140;00:23:28,441;on the likes of you.
363;00:23:28,475;00:23:30,577;Pyp.
364;00:23:30,611;00:23:32,613;Do you think
364;00:23:30,611;00:23:32,613;Ned Stark's bastard
365;00:23:32,647;00:23:34,682;bleeds like the rest of us?
366;00:23:41,956;00:23:43,624;Next!
367;00:23:54,237;00:23:55,837;Next!
368;00:24:09,450;00:24:11,151;Well, Lord Snow,
369;00:24:11,185;00:24:13,686;it appears you're
369;00:24:11,185;00:24:13,686;the least useless person here.
370;00:24:14,888;00:24:16,322;Go clean yourselves up.
371;00:24:16,356;00:24:19,259;There's only so much
371;00:24:16,356;00:24:19,259;I can stomach in a day.
372;00:24:19,293;00:24:22,262;A charming man.
373;00:24:22,296;00:24:24,397;I don't need him
373;00:24:22,296;00:24:24,397;to be charming.
374;00:24:24,431;00:24:27,100;I need him to turn this bunch
374;00:24:24,431;00:24:27,100;of thieves and runaways
375;00:24:27,135;00:24:28,969;into men of the Night's Watch.
376;00:24:29,003;00:24:31,805;And how's that going,
376;00:24:29,003;00:24:31,805;Commander Mormont?
377;00:24:31,840;00:24:34,208;Slowly.
378;00:24:36,478;00:24:38,112;A raven came
379;00:24:38,147;00:24:40,048;for Ned Stark's son.
380;00:24:43,620;00:24:46,122;Good news or bad?
381;00:24:46,156;00:24:47,857;Both.
382;00:24:49,126;00:24:52,294;Lord Stark.
383;00:24:52,329;00:24:55,331;I meant to give you this earlier.
384;00:24:57,467;00:24:59,669;So forgetful these days.
385;00:25:01,504;00:25:04,273;A raven from Winterfell
385;00:25:01,504;00:25:04,273;this morning.
386;00:25:14,983;00:25:17,251;Good news?
387;00:25:20,622;00:25:23,224;Perhaps you'd like to
387;00:25:20,622;00:25:23,224;share it with your wife?
388;00:25:25,761;00:25:28,363;My wife is in Winterfell.
388;00:25:25,761;00:25:28,363;Is she?
389;00:25:36,372;00:25:38,640;Yes, I'm looking at you.
390;00:25:41,944;00:25:43,945;I thought that she'd
390;00:25:41,944;00:25:43,945;be safest in here.
391;00:25:43,980;00:25:46,881;One of several such
391;00:25:43,980;00:25:46,881;establishments I own.
392;00:25:49,118;00:25:50,586;You're a funny man.
393;00:25:50,620;00:25:53,222;Huh?
393;00:25:50,620;00:25:53,222;A very funny man.
394;00:25:54,491;00:25:55,791;Ned!
395;00:26:03,401;00:26:05,202;Ah, the Starks--
396;00:26:05,237;00:26:08,473;Quick tempers, slow minds.
397;00:26:13,246;00:26:15,948;You broke my nose, bastard!
398;00:26:23,189;00:26:25,257;It's an improvement.
399;00:26:28,427;00:26:31,596;If we threw you over the Wall, I wonder
399;00:26:28,427;00:26:31,596;how long it would take you to hit.
400;00:26:31,630;00:26:33,665;I wonder if they'd find you
400;00:26:31,630;00:26:33,665;before the wolves did.
401;00:26:38,371;00:26:40,472;What're you looking at,
401;00:26:38,371;00:26:40,472;Half Man?
402;00:26:40,506;00:26:43,041;I'm looking at you.
403;00:26:43,075;00:26:45,343;Yes.
404;00:26:45,378;00:26:48,446;You've got an interesting face.
405;00:26:49,448;00:26:52,651;Hmm, very distinctive faces.
406;00:26:52,685;00:26:54,319;All of you.
407;00:26:54,353;00:26:56,555;And what do you care
407;00:26:54,353;00:26:56,555;about our faces?
408;00:26:56,589;00:26:59,791;It's just I think
408;00:26:56,589;00:26:59,791;they would look marvelous
409;00:26:59,826;00:27:02,461;decorating spikes
409;00:26:59,826;00:27:02,461;in King's Landing.
410;00:27:02,495;00:27:05,630;Perhaps I'll write my sister,
410;00:27:02,495;00:27:05,630;the Queen, about it.
411;00:27:07,867;00:27:10,202;We'll talk later, Lord Snow.
412;00:27:15,875;00:27:18,476;Everybody knew
412;00:27:15,875;00:27:18,476;what this place was
413;00:27:18,511;00:27:20,479;and no one told me.
414;00:27:20,513;00:27:22,915;No one but you.
415;00:27:22,949;00:27:24,783;My father knew
416;00:27:24,818;00:27:27,086;and he left me to rot
416;00:27:24,818;00:27:27,086;at the Wall all the same.
417;00:27:27,120;00:27:28,754;Grenn's father left him too...
418;00:27:28,789;00:27:32,125;Outside a farmhouse
418;00:27:28,789;00:27:32,125;when he was three.
419;00:27:32,159;00:27:36,029;Pyp was caught stealing
419;00:27:32,159;00:27:36,029;a wheel of cheese.
420;00:27:36,063;00:27:39,466;His little sister hadn't
420;00:27:36,063;00:27:39,466;eaten in three days.
421;00:27:39,500;00:27:43,237;He was given a choice:
421;00:27:39,500;00:27:43,237;his right hand or the Wall.
422;00:27:43,271;00:27:45,805;I've been asking the Lord
422;00:27:43,271;00:27:45,805;commander about them.
423;00:27:45,840;00:27:47,024;Fascinating stories.
424;00:27:47,144;00:27:49,347;They hate me because
424;00:27:47,144;00:27:49,347;I'm better than they are.
425;00:27:49,467;00:27:50,978;It's a lucky thing
425;00:27:49,467;00:27:50,978;none of them were trained
426;00:27:51,012;00:27:53,547;by a master-at-arms
426;00:27:51,012;00:27:53,547;like your Ser Rodrik.
427;00:27:53,581;00:27:56,416;I don't imagine any of them
427;00:27:53,581;00:27:56,416;have ever held a real sword
428;00:27:56,450;00:27:58,552;before they came here.
429;00:28:01,756;00:28:03,723;Oh...
430;00:28:03,758;00:28:06,793;Your brother Bran.
431;00:28:06,828;00:28:09,129;He's woken up.
432;00:28:10,398;00:28:12,499;The mere suggestion
432;00:28:10,398;00:28:12,499;that the Queen's brother
433;00:28:12,533;00:28:14,834;tried to kill your boy
433;00:28:12,533;00:28:14,834;would be considered treason.
434;00:28:14,869;00:28:17,104;We have proof.
434;00:28:14,869;00:28:17,104;We have the blade.
435;00:28:17,138;00:28:19,272;Which Lord Tyrion will say
435;00:28:17,138;00:28:19,272;was stolen from him.
436;00:28:19,307;00:28:21,875;The only man who could say
436;00:28:19,307;00:28:21,875;otherwise has no throat,
437;00:28:21,909;00:28:24,143;thanks to your boy's wolf.
438;00:28:24,178;00:28:27,146;Petyr has promised
438;00:28:24,178;00:28:27,146;to help us find the truth.
439;00:28:28,382;00:28:30,283;He's like a little brother
439;00:28:28,382;00:28:30,283;to me, Ned.
440;00:28:30,318;00:28:32,552;He would never betray my trust.
441;00:28:32,586;00:28:35,187;I'll try to keep you
441;00:28:32,586;00:28:35,187;alive, for her sake.
442;00:28:35,222;00:28:36,856;A fool's task, admittedly,
443;00:28:36,890;00:28:39,658;but I've never been able
443;00:28:36,890;00:28:39,658;to refuse your wife anything.
444;00:28:39,692;00:28:41,826;I won't forget this.
445;00:28:41,861;00:28:43,928;You're a true friend.
446;00:28:43,963;00:28:47,231;Don't tell anyone.
446;00:28:43,963;00:28:47,231;I have a reputation to maintain.
447;00:28:51,403;00:28:53,905;How could you be so stupid?
447;00:28:51,403;00:28:53,905;Calm down.
448;00:28:53,939;00:28:55,773;He's a child--
448;00:28:53,939;00:28:55,773;10 years old.
449;00:28:55,807;00:28:58,209;What were you thinking?
449;00:28:55,807;00:28:58,209;I was thinking of us.
450;00:28:58,243;00:29:00,845;You're a bit late to start
450;00:28:58,243;00:29:00,845;complaining about it now.
451;00:29:00,879;00:29:02,747;What has the boy told them?
451;00:29:00,879;00:29:02,747;Nothing.
452;00:29:02,781;00:29:04,749;He's said nothing.
452;00:29:02,781;00:29:04,749;He remembers nothing.
453;00:29:04,783;00:29:06,918;Then what are you raving about?
454;00:29:06,952;00:29:08,586;What if it comes back to him?
455;00:29:08,621;00:29:10,422;If he tells his father
455;00:29:08,621;00:29:10,422;what he saw--
456;00:29:10,456;00:29:12,891;We'll say he was lying.
456;00:29:10,456;00:29:12,891;We'll say he was dreaming.
457;00:29:12,926;00:29:14,460;We'll say whatever we like.
458;00:29:14,494;00:29:16,762;I think we can outfox
458;00:29:14,494;00:29:16,762;a 10-year-old.
459;00:29:16,797;00:29:20,032;And my husband?
459;00:29:16,797;00:29:20,032;I'll go to war with him if I have to.
460;00:29:20,067;00:29:22,836;They can write
460;00:29:20,067;00:29:22,836;a ballad about us:
461;00:29:22,870;00:29:25,171;The War for Cersei's Cunt.
462;00:29:30,077;00:29:32,079;Let me go.
462;00:29:30,077;00:29:32,079;Never.
463;00:29:32,113;00:29:34,747;Let me go.
463;00:29:32,113;00:29:34,747;The boy
464;00:29:34,782;00:29:37,049;won't talk.
465;00:29:37,084;00:29:39,085;And if he does, I'll kill him.
466;00:29:39,120;00:29:42,555;Him, Ned Stark, the King--
466;00:29:39,120;00:29:42,555;the whole bloody lot of them,
467;00:29:42,589;00:29:45,424;until you and I are
467;00:29:42,589;00:29:45,424;the only people
468;00:29:45,458;00:29:47,659;left in this world.
469;00:29:58,070;00:30:00,104;I wish I could see the girls.
470;00:30:00,139;00:30:03,374;It's too dangerous.
470;00:30:00,139;00:30:03,374;Just for a moment.
471;00:30:03,408;00:30:05,676;Until we know
471;00:30:03,408;00:30:05,676;who our enemies are--
472;00:30:05,711;00:30:07,912;I know they did it, Ned.
472;00:30:05,711;00:30:07,912;The Lannisters.
473;00:30:07,946;00:30:09,947;In my bones, I know it.
474;00:30:09,981;00:30:11,982;Littlefinger's right.
475;00:30:13,585;00:30:15,887;I can't do anything
475;00:30:13,585;00:30:15,887;without proof.
476;00:30:15,921;00:30:18,456;And if you find the proof?
477;00:30:18,490;00:30:20,691;Then I bring it to Robert...
478;00:30:20,726;00:30:23,495;And hope he's still
478;00:30:20,726;00:30:23,495;the man I once knew.
479;00:30:25,264;00:30:27,265;You watch yourself
479;00:30:25,264;00:30:27,265;on the road, huh?
480;00:30:27,300;00:30:30,736;That temper of yours
480;00:30:27,300;00:30:30,736;is a dangerous thing.
481;00:30:30,770;00:30:33,606;My temper?
481;00:30:30,770;00:30:33,606;Gods be good,
482;00:30:33,641;00:30:36,409;you nearly killed poor
482;00:30:33,641;00:30:36,409;Littlefinger yesterday.
483;00:30:41,215;00:30:42,916;He still loves you.
484;00:30:42,950;00:30:45,986;Does he?
485;00:31:03,370;00:31:05,204;Off with you.
486;00:31:37,001;00:31:40,470;Yes, it's been a long time.
487;00:31:40,505;00:31:44,240;But I still remember
487;00:31:40,505;00:31:44,240;every face.
488;00:31:45,809;00:31:47,943;You remember your first?
489;00:31:50,347;00:31:52,515;Of course, Your Grace.
490;00:31:52,549;00:31:54,584;Who was it?
491;00:31:54,618;00:31:56,753;A Tyroshi.
492;00:31:56,787;00:31:59,055;Never learned the name.
492;00:31:56,787;00:31:59,055;Hmm.
493;00:31:59,089;00:32:01,391;How'd you do it?
494;00:32:01,426;00:32:03,493;Lance through the heart.
495;00:32:03,528;00:32:05,363;Quick one.
496;00:32:06,732;00:32:09,100;Lucky for you.
497;00:32:09,134;00:32:13,005;Mine was some Tarly boy
497;00:32:09,134;00:32:13,005;at the Battle of Summerhall.
498;00:32:14,474;00:32:17,008;My horse took an arrow
498;00:32:14,474;00:32:17,008;so I was on foot,
499;00:32:17,043;00:32:19,044;slogging through the mud.
500;00:32:20,346;00:32:25,684;He came running at me,
500;00:32:20,346;00:32:25,684;this dumb high-born lad,
501;00:32:25,718;00:32:27,887;thinking he could end
501;00:32:25,718;00:32:27,887;the rebellion
502;00:32:27,921;00:32:30,455;with single swing of his sword.
503;00:32:31,791;00:32:33,792;I knocked him down
503;00:32:31,791;00:32:33,792;with the hammer.
504;00:32:33,827;00:32:36,195;Gods, I was strong then.
505;00:32:36,229;00:32:39,065;Caved in his breastplate.
506;00:32:39,099;00:32:42,268;Probably shattered
506;00:32:39,099;00:32:42,268;every rib he had.
507;00:32:42,303;00:32:46,140;Stood over him,
507;00:32:42,303;00:32:46,140;hammer in the air.
508;00:32:46,174;00:32:50,511;Right before I brought it down
508;00:32:46,174;00:32:50,511;he shouted, Wait!
509;00:32:50,546;00:32:53,581;Wait.
510;00:32:57,919;00:33:01,622;They never tell you
510;00:32:57,919;00:33:01,622;how they all shit themselves.
511;00:33:01,656;00:33:06,192;They don't put that part
511;00:33:01,656;00:33:06,192;in the songs.
512;00:33:08,728;00:33:11,230;Stupid boy.
513;00:33:12,332;00:33:14,934;Now the Tarlys bend the knee
514;00:33:14,968;00:33:17,370;like everyone else.
515;00:33:17,404;00:33:19,539;He could have lingered
516;00:33:19,573;00:33:22,242;on the edge of the battle
516;00:33:19,573;00:33:22,242;with the smart boys
517;00:33:22,276;00:33:25,879;and today his wife would
517;00:33:22,276;00:33:25,879;be making him miserable,
518;00:33:25,914;00:33:28,883;his sons would be ingrates,
519;00:33:28,917;00:33:31,953;and he'd be waking
519;00:33:28,917;00:33:31,953;three times in the night
520;00:33:31,987;00:33:34,889;to piss into a bowl.
520;00:33:31,987;00:33:34,889;Wine!
521;00:33:37,892;00:33:42,496;Lancel.
521;00:33:37,892;00:33:42,496;Gods, what a stupid name.
522;00:33:43,464;00:33:47,067;Lancel Lannister.
523;00:33:47,101;00:33:51,271;Who named you?
523;00:33:47,101;00:33:51,271;Some halfwit with a stutter?
524;00:33:53,674;00:33:56,510;What are you doing?
525;00:33:57,912;00:34:00,447;It's empty, Your Grace.
525;00:33:57,912;00:34:00,447;What do you mean it's empty?
526;00:34:00,481;00:34:03,316;There's no more wine.
526;00:34:00,481;00:34:03,316;Is that what empty means?
527;00:34:05,386;00:34:07,754;So get more.
528;00:34:11,425;00:34:13,659;Tell your cousin
528;00:34:11,425;00:34:13,659;to get in here.
529;00:34:13,693;00:34:15,094;Kingslayer!
530;00:34:15,128;00:34:17,163;Get in here.
531;00:34:24,603;00:34:27,805;Surrounded by Lannisters.
532;00:34:27,839;00:34:32,076;Every time I close my eyes
532;00:34:27,839;00:34:32,076;I see their blond hair
533;00:34:32,110;00:34:35,379;and their smug,
533;00:34:32,110;00:34:35,379;satisfied faces.
534;00:34:35,413;00:34:38,181;It must wound your pride, huh?
535;00:34:38,216;00:34:41,184;Standing out there
535;00:34:38,216;00:34:41,184;like a glorified sentry.
536;00:34:42,620;00:34:46,490;Jaime Lannister,
536;00:34:42,620;00:34:46,490;son of the mighty Tywin...
537;00:34:47,759;00:34:50,195;Forced to mind the door
537;00:34:47,759;00:34:50,195;while your King
538;00:34:50,229;00:34:53,198;eats and drinks
538;00:34:50,229;00:34:53,198;and shits and fucks.
539;00:34:55,101;00:34:56,701;So come on.
540;00:34:56,736;00:34:58,836;We're telling war stories.
541;00:35:00,072;00:35:03,708;Who was your first kill,
541;00:35:00,072;00:35:03,708;not counting old men?
542;00:35:04,943;00:35:07,578;One of the outlaws
542;00:35:04,943;00:35:07,578;in the Brotherhood.
543;00:35:07,613;00:35:10,181;I was there that day.
544;00:35:10,215;00:35:13,384;You were only a squire,
544;00:35:10,215;00:35:13,384;16 years old.
545;00:35:13,418;00:35:16,320;You killed Simon Toyne
545;00:35:13,418;00:35:16,320;with a counter riposte.
546;00:35:16,354;00:35:18,622;Best move I ever saw.
547;00:35:18,656;00:35:22,893;A good fighter, Toyne,
547;00:35:18,656;00:35:22,893;but he lacked stamina.
548;00:35:22,927;00:35:25,062;Your outlaw...
549;00:35:25,097;00:35:27,665;Any last words?
550;00:35:27,699;00:35:30,534;I cut his head off, so no.
550;00:35:27,699;00:35:30,534;Hmmm.
551;00:35:30,569;00:35:33,505;What about Aerys Targaryen?
552;00:35:33,539;00:35:37,475;What did the Mad King say when
552;00:35:33,539;00:35:37,475;you stabbed him in the back?
553;00:35:37,510;00:35:39,578;I never asked.
554;00:35:39,612;00:35:42,648;Did he call you a traitor?
555;00:35:42,682;00:35:45,852;Did he plead for a reprieve?
556;00:35:47,321;00:35:50,356;He said the same thing
556;00:35:47,321;00:35:50,356;he'd been saying for hours...
557;00:35:52,026;00:35:54,226;Burn them all.
558;00:35:58,998;00:36:00,932;If that's all, Your Grace...
559;00:36:33,196;00:36:35,631;Do the Dothraki buy
559;00:36:33,196;00:36:35,631;their slaves?
560;00:36:35,665;00:36:37,800;The Dothraki don't
560;00:36:35,665;00:36:37,800;believe in money.
561;00:36:37,834;00:36:40,135;Most of their slaves were
561;00:36:37,834;00:36:40,135;given to them as gifts.
562;00:36:40,169;00:36:42,404;From whom?
562;00:36:40,169;00:36:42,404;If you rule a city
563;00:36:42,438;00:36:45,373;and you see the horde approaching,
563;00:36:42,438;00:36:45,373;you have two choices:
564;00:36:45,407;00:36:47,241;Pay tribute or fight.
565;00:36:47,276;00:36:48,976;An easy choice for most.
566;00:36:49,010;00:36:52,513;Of course, sometimes
566;00:36:49,010;00:36:52,513;it's not enough.
567;00:36:52,547;00:36:55,983;Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by
567;00:36:52,547;00:36:55,983;the number of slaves he's given.
568;00:36:56,018;00:36:58,586;He might think the men too weak
568;00:36:56,018;00:36:58,586;or the women too ugly.
569;00:36:58,621;00:37:02,157;Sometimes a Khal decides his riders
569;00:36:58,621;00:37:02,157;haven't had a good fight in months
570;00:37:02,191;00:37:05,494;and need the practice.
570;00:37:02,191;00:37:05,494;Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.
571;00:37:07,865;00:37:10,633;Tell them all to stop.
572;00:37:10,668;00:37:12,802;You want the entire
572;00:37:10,668;00:37:12,802;horde to stop?
573;00:37:12,836;00:37:15,171;For how long?
574;00:37:15,205;00:37:18,240;Until I command them otherwise.
575;00:37:18,274;00:37:20,642;You're learning
575;00:37:18,274;00:37:20,642;to talk like a Queen.
576;00:37:20,677;00:37:22,744;Not a Queen.
577;00:37:22,779;00:37:24,680;A Khaleesi.
578;00:37:34,924;00:37:37,460;Annakhas dozgosores.
579;00:38:01,553;00:38:03,654;You dare!
580;00:38:03,689;00:38:07,159;You give commands to me?
580;00:38:03,689;00:38:07,159;To me?
581;00:38:08,995;00:38:12,698;You do not command the dragon.
581;00:38:08,995;00:38:12,698;I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
582;00:38:12,732;00:38:15,101;I don't take orders
582;00:38:12,732;00:38:15,101;from savages
583;00:38:15,135;00:38:17,636;or their sluts.
583;00:38:15,135;00:38:17,636;Do you hear me?
584;00:38:20,340;00:38:22,842;Hash shafka zali nharees,

585;00:38:22,877;00:38:25,679;Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.
586;00:38:25,713;00:38:27,181;No.
587;00:38:27,215;00:38:29,216;Ishish chare acharoe

588;00:38:29,251;00:38:32,319;Rakharo say you should take ear,
589;00:38:32,354;00:38:36,023;to teach respect.
589;00:38:32,354;00:38:36,023;Please please, don't hurt him.
590;00:38:40,028;00:38:43,763;Tell him I don't want
590;00:38:40,028;00:38:43,763;my brother harmed.
591;00:38:43,797;00:38:46,665;Khaleesi vos zalo

592;00:38:46,700;00:38:49,101;Huh?
593;00:38:50,169;00:38:52,837;Shafki.
594;00:38:56,576;00:39:00,280;Mormont!
594;00:38:56,576;00:39:00,280;Kill these Dothraki dogs!
595;00:39:05,520;00:39:07,388;I am your King!
596;00:39:09,425;00:39:12,494;Shall we return
596;00:39:09,425;00:39:12,494;to the Khalasar, khaleesi?
597;00:39:32,313;00:39:34,647;Uh uh uh uh uh.
598;00:39:34,681;00:39:37,784;You walk.
599;00:42:07,978;00:42:12,447;I wanted to be here when you
599;00:42:07,978;00:42:12,447;saw it for the first time.
600;00:42:20,490;00:42:23,892;I'm leaving this morning.
600;00:42:20,490;00:42:23,892;You're leaving?
601;00:42:24,961;00:42:27,195;I'm the First Ranger.
602;00:42:27,230;00:42:29,498;My job is out there.
603;00:42:29,532;00:42:32,868;There have been disturbing reports.
603;00:42:29,532;00:42:32,868;What kind of reports?
604;00:42:32,902;00:42:34,803;The kind I don't
604;00:42:32,902;00:42:34,803;want to believe.
605;00:42:36,439;00:42:38,941;I'm ready.
605;00:42:36,439;00:42:38,941;I won't let you down.
606;00:42:38,975;00:42:41,510;You're not going.
607;00:42:43,980;00:42:45,748;You're no ranger, Jon.
608;00:42:45,782;00:42:48,517;But I'm better than every--
608;00:42:45,782;00:42:48,517;Better than no one!
609;00:42:53,690;00:42:55,557;Here...
610;00:42:55,591;00:42:57,926;A man gets what he earns,
611;00:42:57,960;00:43:00,128;when he earns it.
612;00:43:04,067;00:43:06,301;We'll speak when I return.
613;00:43:21,750;00:43:24,953;A bear's balls.
613;00:43:21,750;00:43:24,953;Oh, you're joking?
614;00:43:24,987;00:43:28,524;And his brains and his guts,
614;00:43:24,987;00:43:28,524;his lungs and his heart
615;00:43:28,558;00:43:31,060;all fried in his own fat.
616;00:43:31,094;00:43:33,696;When you're a hundred miles
616;00:43:31,094;00:43:33,696;north of the Wall
617;00:43:33,731;00:43:37,232;and you ate your last meal a week ago,
617;00:43:33,731;00:43:37,232;you leave nothing for the wolves.
618;00:43:37,267;00:43:40,536;And how do
618;00:43:37,267;00:43:40,536;a bear's balls taste?
619;00:43:40,571;00:43:42,872;A bit chewy.
620;00:43:44,975;00:43:48,511;And what about you, My Lord?
620;00:43:44,975;00:43:48,511;What's the strangest thing you've eaten?
621;00:43:48,545;00:43:50,913;Do Dornish girls count?
622;00:43:54,884;00:43:58,019;So you roam the Seven Kingdoms,
623;00:43:58,053;00:44:00,254;collaring pickpockets
623;00:43:58,053;00:44:00,254;and horse thieves
624;00:44:00,288;00:44:02,389;and bringing them here
624;00:44:00,288;00:44:02,389;as eager recruits?
625;00:44:02,424;00:44:04,224;Aye.
626;00:44:04,259;00:44:07,260;But it's not all of 'em's
626;00:44:04,259;00:44:07,260;done bad things.
627;00:44:07,295;00:44:10,296;Some of 'em's just poor lads
627;00:44:07,295;00:44:10,296;looking for steady feed.
628;00:44:10,331;00:44:13,032;Some of 'em's high-born lads
628;00:44:10,331;00:44:13,032;looking for glory.
629;00:44:13,066;00:44:16,602;They have a better chance finding feed
629;00:44:13,066;00:44:16,602;than glory.
630;00:44:16,636;00:44:20,172;The Night's Watch is
630;00:44:16,636;00:44:20,172;a joke to you, is it?
631;00:44:20,206;00:44:22,742;Is that what we are, Lannister?
632;00:44:22,776;00:44:25,611;An army of jesters in black?
633;00:44:25,645;00:44:27,780;You don't have enough men
633;00:44:25,645;00:44:27,780;to be an army
634;00:44:27,814;00:44:31,450;and aside from Yoren here, none
634;00:44:27,814;00:44:31,450;of you are particularly funny.
635;00:44:31,485;00:44:34,220;I hope we've provided you
635;00:44:31,485;00:44:34,220;with some good stories to tell
636;00:44:34,255;00:44:36,189;when you're back
636;00:44:34,255;00:44:36,189;in King's Landing.
637;00:44:36,224;00:44:37,758;But something to think about
638;00:44:37,792;00:44:39,893;while you're drinking
638;00:44:37,792;00:44:39,893;your wine down there,
639;00:44:39,928;00:44:41,862;enjoying your brothels--
640;00:44:41,897;00:44:46,234;Half the boys you've seen training
640;00:44:41,897;00:44:46,234;will die north of the Wall.
641;00:44:46,269;00:44:49,738;Might be a wilding's axe
641;00:44:46,269;00:44:49,738;that gets them,
642;00:44:49,772;00:44:52,440;might be sickness,
643;00:44:52,475;00:44:55,309;might just be the cold.
644;00:44:55,344;00:44:58,045;They die in pain.
645;00:44:58,079;00:45:01,615;And they do it so plump
645;00:44:58,079;00:45:01,615;little lords like you
646;00:45:01,649;00:45:05,118;can enjoy their summer
646;00:45:01,649;00:45:05,118;afternoons in peace and comfort.
647;00:45:07,120;00:45:09,121;Do you think I'm plump?
648;00:45:12,859;00:45:15,260;Listen, Benjen--
648;00:45:12,859;00:45:15,260;May I call you Benjen?
649;00:45:15,295;00:45:16,481;Call me what you like.
650;00:45:16,601;00:45:18,912;I'm not sure what I've
650;00:45:16,601;00:45:18,912;done to offend you.
651;00:45:19,032;00:45:21,200;I have great admiration
651;00:45:19,032;00:45:21,200;for the Night's Watch.
652;00:45:21,234;00:45:23,803;I've great admiration
652;00:45:21,234;00:45:23,803;for you as First Ranger.
653;00:45:23,837;00:45:25,871;You know, my brother
653;00:45:23,837;00:45:25,871;once told me
654;00:45:25,906;00:45:28,508;that nothing someone says
654;00:45:25,906;00:45:28,508;before the word but
655;00:45:28,542;00:45:30,442;really counts.
656;00:45:30,477;00:45:32,979;But...
657;00:45:33,013;00:45:36,248;I don't believe that giants
657;00:45:33,013;00:45:36,248;and ghouls and White Walkers
658;00:45:36,282;00:45:38,083;are lurking beyond the Wall.
659;00:45:38,117;00:45:40,485;I believe that
659;00:45:38,117;00:45:40,485;the only difference
660;00:45:40,520;00:45:42,787;between us and
660;00:45:40,520;00:45:42,787;the wildlings is that
661;00:45:42,821;00:45:45,156;when the Wall went up,
661;00:45:42,821;00:45:45,156;our ancestors happened
662;00:45:45,191;00:45:47,424;to live on
662;00:45:45,191;00:45:47,424;the right side of it.
663;00:45:47,459;00:45:49,359;You're right.
664;00:45:50,962;00:45:53,063;The wildlings are
664;00:45:50,962;00:45:53,063;no different from us.
665;00:45:53,097;00:45:55,966;A little rougher maybe.
666;00:45:56,000;00:45:58,769;But they're made
666;00:45:56,000;00:45:58,769;of meat and bone.
667;00:45:58,804;00:46:01,406;I know how to track them
667;00:45:58,804;00:46:01,406;and I know how to kill them.
668;00:46:01,440;00:46:05,377;It's not the wildlings
668;00:46:01,440;00:46:05,377;giving me sleepless nights.
669;00:46:06,513;00:46:08,681;You've never been
669;00:46:06,513;00:46:08,681;north of the Wall,
670;00:46:08,715;00:46:11,117;so don't tell me
670;00:46:08,715;00:46:11,117;what's out there.
671;00:46:14,622;00:46:16,656;Are you going below?
672;00:46:18,158;00:46:21,527;Keep well, keep warm.
672;00:46:18,158;00:46:21,527;Enjoy the capital, brother.
673;00:46:21,562;00:46:24,063;Oh, I always do.
674;00:46:32,406;00:46:34,674;I think he's starting
674;00:46:32,406;00:46:34,674;to like me.
675;00:46:37,412;00:46:40,881;Going below?
675;00:46:37,412;00:46:40,881;Aye.
676;00:46:40,916;00:46:42,550;Into the tunnel
677;00:46:42,584;00:46:44,720;and out the other side.
678;00:46:44,754;00:46:47,490;He'll be north of the Wall
678;00:46:44,754;00:46:47,490;for a month or two.
679;00:46:49,626;00:46:52,795;So you're heading down
679;00:46:49,626;00:46:52,795;to King's Landing too.
680;00:46:52,830;00:46:55,398;Aye, day after tomorrow.
681;00:46:55,433;00:46:59,236;I get about half of my
681;00:46:55,433;00:46:59,236;recruits from their dungeons.
682;00:46:59,270;00:47:03,540;Let's share the road.
682;00:46:59,270;00:47:03,540;I could use some decent company.
683;00:47:03,575;00:47:08,613;I... I travel a bit
683;00:47:03,575;00:47:08,613;on the grubby side, My Lord.
684;00:47:08,647;00:47:12,651;Not this time. We'll be staying at
684;00:47:08,647;00:47:12,651;the finest castles and inns.
685;00:47:12,685;00:47:15,420;No one turns away a Lannister.
686;00:47:20,926;00:47:23,193;At Jakar?
687;00:47:23,228;00:47:25,028;Athjahakar.
688;00:47:25,062;00:47:27,297;Ath ja haker.
689;00:47:27,331;00:47:29,265;Athjahakar.
690;00:47:29,299;00:47:31,167;Athjahakar.
691;00:47:31,201;00:47:32,968;Yes, Khaleesi.
692;00:47:34,738;00:47:36,972;Oh, what are you doing?
693;00:47:37,007;00:47:39,608;When was last time
693;00:47:37,007;00:47:39,608;you bleed, Khaleesi?
694;00:47:42,045;00:47:44,079;You change, Khaleesi.
695;00:47:53,124;00:47:55,993;For a man on horseback,
695;00:47:53,124;00:47:55,993;the curved blade
696;00:47:56,027;00:47:58,529;is a good thing,
696;00:47:56,027;00:47:58,529;easier to handle.
697;00:47:58,563;00:48:02,033;It's a good weapon
697;00:47:58,563;00:48:02,033;for a Dothrakan.
698;00:48:02,067;00:48:04,836;But a man in full plate--
699;00:48:04,870;00:48:06,671;Shori tawakof
700;00:48:06,706;00:48:09,674;the arakh won't get
700;00:48:06,706;00:48:09,674;through the steel.
701;00:48:10,910;00:48:13,011;That's where the broadsword
701;00:48:10,910;00:48:13,011;has the advantage.
702;00:48:13,046;00:48:16,048;Designed for piercing plate.
703;00:48:20,219;00:48:23,454;Armor.
703;00:48:20,219;00:48:23,454;Armor.
704;00:48:23,488;00:48:26,123;Armor make a man...
705;00:48:26,157;00:48:28,291;Vroz?
705;00:48:26,157;00:48:28,291;Slow.
706;00:48:28,325;00:48:30,259;Slow.
706;00:48:28,325;00:48:30,259;It's true,
707;00:48:30,294;00:48:33,595;but it also keeps a man alive.
708;00:48:51,516;00:48:54,017;He still is.
709;00:48:54,052;00:48:56,520;A man of great honor
710;00:48:56,554;00:48:58,522;and I betrayed him.
711;00:49:22,147;00:49:24,615;I don't think
711;00:49:22,147;00:49:24,615;she wants to eat dog.
712;00:49:27,886;00:49:30,654;The Khaleesi
712;00:49:27,886;00:49:30,654;have baby inside her.
713;00:49:32,190;00:49:35,360;It is true.
713;00:49:32,190;00:49:35,360;She does not bleed for two moons.
714;00:49:35,394;00:49:37,929;Her belly start to swell.
715;00:49:39,866;00:49:43,769;She does not want to eat horse.
716;00:49:45,172;00:49:48,075;I'll have the boys
716;00:49:45,172;00:49:48,075;butcher a goat for supper.
717;00:49:53,248;00:49:55,916;I need to ride to Qohor.
718;00:49:58,853;00:50:02,856;Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak.
719;00:50:02,891;00:50:05,225;Don't worry.
719;00:50:02,891;00:50:05,225;I'll catch you.
720;00:50:05,259;00:50:07,694;The horde's easy to find.
721;00:50:18,172;00:50:20,073;Don't stand so still.
722;00:50:20,107;00:50:23,643;It's harder to hit
722;00:50:20,107;00:50:23,643;a moving target.
723;00:50:27,815;00:50:30,650;Except for you.
723;00:50:27,815;00:50:30,650;You move too much.
724;00:50:30,684;00:50:33,386;I could just hold my sword out
724;00:50:30,684;00:50:33,386;and let you do the work for me.
725;00:50:38,558;00:50:41,526;How many winters have
725;00:50:38,558;00:50:41,526;you seen, Lord Tyrion?
726;00:50:41,561;00:50:44,195;Eight-- no, nine.
727;00:50:44,229;00:50:46,764;All of them brief?
728;00:50:46,798;00:50:50,033;They say the winter of my birth was
728;00:50:46,798;00:50:50,033;three years long, Maester Aemon.
729;00:50:50,068;00:50:53,103;This summer has lasted nine.
730;00:50:53,137;00:50:57,473;But reports from the Citadel
730;00:50:53,137;00:50:57,473;tell us the days grow shorter.
731;00:50:57,507;00:50:59,942;The Starks are always
731;00:50:57,507;00:50:59,942;right eventually:
732;00:50:59,976;00:51:02,945;Winter is coming.
733;00:51:02,979;00:51:05,780;This one will be long
734;00:51:05,814;00:51:08,516;and dark things
734;00:51:05,814;00:51:08,516;will come with it.
735;00:51:08,550;00:51:11,619;We've been capturing wildlings,
736;00:51:11,653;00:51:14,688;more every month.
736;00:51:11,653;00:51:14,688;They're fleeing south.
737;00:51:14,723;00:51:18,960;The ones who flee say they've seen
737;00:51:14,723;00:51:18,960;the White Walkers.
738;00:51:18,994;00:51:22,398;Yes, and the fishermen of
738;00:51:18,994;00:51:22,398;Lannisport say they see mermaids.
739;00:51:22,432;00:51:25,835;One of our own rangers swore he
739;00:51:22,432;00:51:25,835;saw them kill his companions.
740;00:51:25,869;00:51:27,937;He swore it right up
740;00:51:25,869;00:51:27,937;to the moment
741;00:51:27,972;00:51:29,873;Ned Stark chopped his head off.
742;00:51:29,907;00:51:32,543;The Night's Watch
742;00:51:29,907;00:51:32,543;is the only thing
743;00:51:32,577;00:51:34,611;standing between the realm
744;00:51:34,646;00:51:36,913;and what lies beyond.
745;00:51:36,948;00:51:39,149;And it has has become an army
746;00:51:39,183;00:51:42,785;of undisciplined boys
746;00:51:39,183;00:51:42,785;and tired old men.
747;00:51:42,820;00:51:46,354;There are less than
747;00:51:42,820;00:51:46,354;a thousand of us now.
748;00:51:46,389;00:51:49,224;We can't man the other
748;00:51:46,389;00:51:49,224;castles on the Wall.
749;00:51:49,258;00:51:52,360;We can't properly
749;00:51:49,258;00:51:52,360;patrol the wilderness.
750;00:51:52,394;00:51:56,063;We've barely enough resources
750;00:51:52,394;00:51:56,063;to keep our lads armed
751;00:51:56,098;00:51:58,733;and fed.
751;00:51:56,098;00:51:58,733;Your sister
752;00:51:58,767;00:52:01,569;sits by the side the King.
753;00:52:01,604;00:52:04,472;Tell her we need help.
754;00:52:04,507;00:52:06,842;When winter does come,
755;00:52:06,876;00:52:10,312;gods help us all
755;00:52:06,876;00:52:10,312;if we're not ready.
756;00:53:17,049;00:53:19,484;I'm sorry to see
756;00:53:17,049;00:53:19,484;you leave, Lannister.
757;00:53:21,220;00:53:23,155;It's either me or this cold.
758;00:53:23,189;00:53:25,557;And it doesn't appear
758;00:53:23,189;00:53:25,557;to be going anywhere.
759;00:53:25,591;00:53:28,560;Will you stop at Winterfell
759;00:53:25,591;00:53:28,560;on your way South?
760;00:53:28,595;00:53:29,828;I expect I will.
761;00:53:29,862;00:53:31,897;Gods know there aren't
761;00:53:29,862;00:53:31,897;many feather beds
762;00:53:31,931;00:53:34,065;between here
762;00:53:31,931;00:53:34,065;and King's Landing.
763;00:53:34,100;00:53:36,234;If you see my brother Bran,
764;00:53:36,269;00:53:38,804;tell him I miss him.
765;00:53:38,838;00:53:40,872;Tell him I'd visit if I could.
766;00:53:40,906;00:53:42,474;Of course.
767;00:53:42,508;00:53:45,077;He'll never walk again.
768;00:53:45,111;00:53:46,778;If you're going to be
768;00:53:45,111;00:53:46,778;a cripple,
769;00:53:46,812;00:53:49,047;it's better to be a rich cripple.
770;00:53:49,082;00:53:51,550;You take care, Snow.
771;00:53:51,584;00:53:53,585;Farewell, My Lord.
772;00:54:05,330;00:54:07,899;You are late, boy.
773;00:54:09,768;00:54:12,269;Tomorrow you will
773;00:54:09,768;00:54:12,269;be here at midday.
774;00:54:12,303;00:54:14,537;Who are you?
775;00:54:14,572;00:54:17,040;Your dancing master,
776;00:54:17,074;00:54:18,642;Syrio Forel.
777;00:54:22,747;00:54:24,247;Tomorrow you will catch it.
778;00:54:24,282;00:54:26,283;Now pick it up.
779;00:54:28,586;00:54:30,888;That is not the way, boy.
780;00:54:30,922;00:54:35,093;This is not a greatsword that is
780;00:54:30,922;00:54:35,093;needing two hands to swing it.
781;00:54:35,127;00:54:39,264;It's too heavy.
781;00:54:35,127;00:54:39,264;It is heavy as it needs to be
782;00:54:39,299;00:54:41,167;to make you strong.
783;00:54:42,069;00:54:43,603;Just so.
784;00:54:43,637;00:54:46,072;One hand is all that is needed.
785;00:54:47,308;00:54:49,443;Now you are standing all wrong.
786;00:54:49,477;00:54:51,846;Turn your body sideface.
787;00:54:51,880;00:54:54,315;Yes.
788;00:54:54,349;00:54:56,518;So.
789;00:54:56,552;00:54:58,886;You are skinny.
789;00:54:56,552;00:54:58,886;That is good.
790;00:54:58,921;00:55:01,923;The target is smaller.
791;00:55:01,957;00:55:04,025;Now the grip--
791;00:55:01,957;00:55:04,025;Let me see.
792;00:55:04,059;00:55:06,827;Yes.
793;00:55:06,862;00:55:09,697;The grip must be delicate.
794;00:55:10,665;00:55:12,566;What if I drop it?
795;00:55:12,601;00:55:14,935;The steel must be
795;00:55:12,601;00:55:14,935;part of your arm.
796;00:55:14,969;00:55:17,705;Can you drop
796;00:55:14,969;00:55:17,705;part of your arm? No.
797;00:55:17,739;00:55:21,975;Nine years Syrio Forel was first
797;00:55:17,739;00:55:21,975;sword to the Sealord of Braavos.
798;00:55:22,010;00:55:24,778;He knows these things.
798;00:55:22,010;00:55:24,778;You must listen to me, boy.
799;00:55:24,812;00:55:26,580;I'm a girl.
800;00:55:26,614;00:55:30,184;Boy, girl--
800;00:55:26,614;00:55:30,184;you are a sword,
801;00:55:30,218;00:55:33,120;that is all.
802;00:55:33,154;00:55:35,556;That is the grip.
803;00:55:35,591;00:55:37,759;You are not holding
803;00:55:35,591;00:55:37,759;a battle-axe.
804;00:55:37,793;00:55:40,128;You are holding--
804;00:55:37,793;00:55:40,128;A needle.
805;00:55:40,163;00:55:41,163;Ahhh.
806;00:55:42,832;00:55:45,434;Just so.
807;00:55:45,469;00:55:48,304;Now we will begin the dance.
808;00:55:48,339;00:55:49,806;Remember, child,
809;00:55:49,840;00:55:52,809;this is not the dance of the
809;00:55:49,840;00:55:52,809;Westeros we are learning--
810;00:55:52,843;00:55:54,978;The knight's dance,
811;00:55:55,012;00:55:57,413;hacking and hammering.
812;00:55:57,448;00:56:00,583;This is the Bravo's dance...
813;00:56:02,086;00:56:04,053;The water dance.
814;00:56:04,087;00:56:06,322;It is swift
815;00:56:06,356;00:56:08,624;and sudden.
816;00:56:10,093;00:56:12,394;All men are made of water,
817;00:56:12,429;00:56:14,163;do you know this?
818;00:56:14,197;00:56:16,499;If you pierce them,
819;00:56:16,533;00:56:20,302;the water leaks out
819;00:56:16,533;00:56:20,302;and they die.
820;00:56:21,470;00:56:24,806;Now you will try to strike me.
821;00:56:27,843;00:56:29,643;Ha!
822;00:56:41,357;00:56:42,857;Up!
823;00:56:46,228;00:56:47,328;Ha!
824;00:56:58,573;00:56:59,940;Ah.
825;00:57:02,377;00:57:03,944;Dead.
826;00:57:03,978;00:57:05,078;Oh!
827;00:57:05,113;00:57:06,713;Dead.
828;00:57:06,748;00:57:08,782;Hup!
829;00:57:11,352;00:57:13,353;Very dead.
830;00:57:13,387;00:57:15,922;Come.
831;00:57:15,956;00:57:17,824;Ah ah ah!
832;00:57:17,858;00:57:20,827;Hup!
833;00:57:20,861;00:57:22,862;Again, faster.
834;00:57:27,901;00:57:29,802;Ah.
