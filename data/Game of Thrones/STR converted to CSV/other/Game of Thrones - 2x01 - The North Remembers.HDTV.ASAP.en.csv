126;00:08:22,628;00:08:24,495;are traitors, too.
127;00:08:24,530;00:08:27,732;I am loyal
127;00:08:24,530;00:08:27,732;to my beloved Joffrey.
128;00:08:28,934;00:08:31,335;Of course you are.
129;00:08:32,971;00:08:36,840;Well, enjoy your name day,
129;00:08:32,971;00:08:36,840;Your Grace.
130;00:08:36,875;00:08:38,775;Wish I could stay
130;00:08:36,875;00:08:38,775;and celebrate,
131;00:08:38,810;00:08:41,578;but there is work
131;00:08:38,810;00:08:41,578;to be done.
132;00:08:41,612;00:08:43,613;What work?
133;00:08:43,648;00:08:45,782;Why are you here?
134;00:08:48,652;00:08:51,887;The raven arrived
134;00:08:48,652;00:08:51,887;from the Citadel
135;00:08:51,921;00:08:55,057;this morning, Your Grace.
136;00:08:55,091;00:08:57,960;The conclave has met,
136;00:08:55,091;00:08:57,960;considered reports
137;00:08:57,994;00:09:00,129;from Maesters all over
137;00:08:57,994;00:09:00,129;the Seven Kingdoms,
138;00:09:00,164;00:09:03,599;and declared
138;00:09:00,164;00:09:03,599;this great summer
139;00:09:03,633;00:09:06,435;done at last.
140;00:09:06,470;00:09:09,272;The longest summer
140;00:09:06,470;00:09:09,272;in living memory.
141;00:09:09,306;00:09:11,274;The peasants say,
141;00:09:09,306;00:09:11,274;a long summer means
142;00:09:11,308;00:09:14,211;an even longer winter.
142;00:09:11,308;00:09:14,211;- A common superstition.
143;00:09:14,245;00:09:17,281;We have enough wheat
143;00:09:14,245;00:09:17,281;for a five-year winter.
144;00:09:17,315;00:09:19,583;If it lasts any longer,
145;00:09:19,617;00:09:22,251;we'll have
145;00:09:19,617;00:09:22,251;fewer peasants.
146;00:09:22,286;00:09:25,254;The city's drowning in refugees,
146;00:09:22,286;00:09:25,254;Your Grace, fleeing the war.
147;00:09:25,288;00:09:26,755;We have nowhere
147;00:09:25,288;00:09:26,755;to house them.
148;00:09:26,789;00:09:28,924;And with winter coming,
148;00:09:26,789;00:09:28,924;it'll only get worse.
149;00:09:28,958;00:09:31,893;You command the City Watch,
149;00:09:28,958;00:09:31,893;do you not, Lord Slynt?
150;00:09:33,396;00:09:35,263;I do, Your Grace.
151;00:09:35,298;00:09:37,299;And are you not
151;00:09:35,298;00:09:37,299;a Lord at my command?
152;00:09:37,333;00:09:40,836;I owe my title and lands
152;00:09:37,333;00:09:40,836;to your generosity, Your Grace.
153;00:09:40,871;00:09:43,506;Then do your job.
153;00:09:40,871;00:09:43,506;Shut the gates to the peasants.
154;00:09:43,540;00:09:46,475;They belong in the field,
154;00:09:43,540;00:09:46,475;not our capital.
155;00:09:46,510;00:09:49,912;Yes, Your Grace.
156;00:09:54,617;00:09:56,251;Don't get up.
157;00:09:57,420;00:10:01,189;More ravishing than ever,
157;00:09:57,420;00:10:01,189;big sister.
158;00:10:02,258;00:10:04,993;War agrees with you.
159;00:10:05,028;00:10:07,929;Forgive the interruption.
159;00:10:05,028;00:10:07,929;Carry on.
160;00:10:09,164;00:10:10,565;What are you doing here?
161;00:10:10,599;00:10:14,301;Ah, it's been
161;00:10:10,599;00:10:14,301;a remarkable journey.
162;00:10:14,335;00:10:18,005;I pissed off the edge
162;00:10:14,335;00:10:18,005;of the Wall,
163;00:10:18,039;00:10:20,941;I slept in a sky cell,
164;00:10:20,975;00:10:23,210;I fought with
164;00:10:20,975;00:10:23,210;the hill tribes--
165;00:10:23,245;00:10:25,980;so many adventures,
166;00:10:26,014;00:10:28,717;so much to be
166;00:10:26,014;00:10:28,717;thankful for.
167;00:10:28,751;00:10:32,021;What are you doing here?
167;00:10:28,751;00:10:32,021;This is the small council.
168;00:10:32,783;00:10:34,383;Yes. well I, do believe,
168;00:10:32,783;00:10:34,383;the Hand of the King,
169;00:10:35,426;00:10:37,327;is welcome at all
169;00:10:35,426;00:10:37,327;small council meetings.
170;00:10:37,361;00:10:39,363;Our father
170;00:10:37,361;00:10:39,363;is Hand of the King.
171;00:10:39,397;00:10:42,433;Yes, but in his absence...
172;00:10:49,607;00:10:51,842;Your father has named
172;00:10:49,607;00:10:51,842;Lord Tyrion
173;00:10:51,877;00:10:54,612;to serve as Hand
173;00:10:51,877;00:10:54,612;in his stead while he fights.
174;00:10:54,646;00:10:57,314;Out! All of you out!
175;00:11:01,987;00:11:04,689;I would like to know
175;00:11:01,987;00:11:04,689;how you tricked father into this.
176;00:11:04,723;00:11:06,691;If I were capable
176;00:11:04,723;00:11:06,691;of tricking father,
177;00:11:06,725;00:11:08,326;I'd be emperor
177;00:11:06,725;00:11:08,326;of the world by now.
178;00:11:08,360;00:11:10,962;You brought this
178;00:11:08,360;00:11:10,962;on yourself.
179;00:11:10,996;00:11:12,463;I've done nothing.
180;00:11:12,498;00:11:14,365;Quite right--
180;00:11:12,498;00:11:14,365;you did nothing
181;00:11:14,400;00:11:16,767;when your son called
181;00:11:14,400;00:11:16,767;for Ned Stark's head.
182;00:11:16,802;00:11:18,769;Now the entire North
182;00:11:16,802;00:11:18,769;has risen up against us.
183;00:11:18,804;00:11:21,272;I tried to stop it.
183;00:11:18,804;00:11:21,272;Did you? You failed.
184;00:11:21,306;00:11:24,442;That bit of theater will haunt
184;00:11:21,306;00:11:24,442;our family for a generation.
185;00:11:24,476;00:11:28,479;Robb Stark is a child.
185;00:11:24,476;00:11:28,479;Who's won every battle he's fought.
186;00:11:28,513;00:11:30,715;Do you understand
186;00:11:28,513;00:11:30,715;we're losing the war?
187;00:11:30,749;00:11:33,985;What do you know about warfare?
187;00:11:30,749;00:11:33,985;Nothing.
188;00:11:34,019;00:11:35,787;But I know people.
189;00:11:35,821;00:11:37,889;And I know that our enemies hate
189;00:11:35,821;00:11:37,889;each other
190;00:11:37,923;00:11:40,825;almost as much
190;00:11:37,923;00:11:40,825;as they hate us.
191;00:11:45,131;00:11:47,766;Joffrey is King.
191;00:11:45,131;00:11:47,766;Joffrey is King.
192;00:11:47,800;00:11:50,335;You are here
192;00:11:47,800;00:11:50,335;to advise him.
193;00:11:50,369;00:11:52,037;I'm only here
193;00:11:50,369;00:11:52,037;to advise him.
194;00:11:52,071;00:11:54,606;And if the King listens
194;00:11:52,071;00:11:54,606;to what I say,
195;00:11:54,641;00:11:58,276;the King might just get
195;00:11:54,641;00:11:58,276;his Uncle Jaime back.
196;00:11:59,979;00:12:01,479;How?
197;00:12:01,514;00:12:03,081;You love your children.
198;00:12:03,115;00:12:04,615;It's your one
198;00:12:03,115;00:12:04,615;redeeming quality.
199;00:12:04,649;00:12:07,584;That and your cheekbones.
200;00:12:07,619;00:12:10,453;The Starks love
200;00:12:07,619;00:12:10,453;their children as well.
201;00:12:10,488;00:12:13,089;And we have two of them.
201;00:12:10,488;00:12:13,089;One.
202;00:12:14,692;00:12:17,660;One?
202;00:12:14,692;00:12:17,660;Arya, little animal-- she disappeared.
203;00:12:17,695;00:12:20,730;Disappeared?
203;00:12:17,695;00:12:20,730;What, in a puff of smoke?
204;00:12:22,466;00:12:25,802;We had three Starks
204;00:12:22,466;00:12:25,802;to trade.
205;00:12:25,836;00:12:28,572;You chopped one's head off
205;00:12:25,836;00:12:28,572;and let another escape.
206;00:12:29,474;00:12:31,574;Father will be furious.
207;00:12:32,643;00:12:34,244;It must be odd for you...
208;00:12:36,748;00:12:39,049;to be the disappointing child.
209;00:12:46,559;00:12:50,395;My Lord, may the Old Gods
209;00:12:46,559;00:12:50,395;watch over your brother
210;00:12:50,430;00:12:53,098;and all our northern sons.
211;00:12:53,133;00:12:57,102;The walls of my Holdfast
211;00:12:53,133;00:12:57,102;will not stand the winter.
212;00:12:57,137;00:13:01,006;The stones were last mortared
212;00:12:57,137;00:13:01,006;in the time of King Aerys,
213;00:13:01,040;00:13:03,408;and I'm afraid
213;00:13:01,040;00:13:03,408;the masons today
214;00:13:03,442;00:13:07,178;are not fit to carry
214;00:13:03,442;00:13:07,178;their fathers' hammers.
215;00:13:07,212;00:13:09,613;When I was a boy,
215;00:13:07,212;00:13:09,613;I remember seeing them
216;00:13:09,648;00:13:14,217;put up a new tower
216;00:13:09,648;00:13:14,217;at Torrhen's Square in a summer.
217;00:13:14,252;00:13:16,353;Men worked back then.
218;00:13:16,387;00:13:19,289;Today, my Holdfast
218;00:13:16,387;00:13:19,289;looks like it was built
219;00:13:19,324;00:13:21,558;by drunk children.
220;00:13:21,593;00:13:25,730;At night you can hear the wind
220;00:13:21,593;00:13:25,730;howling through the gaps.
221;00:13:25,764;00:13:27,732;And the Gods
221;00:13:25,764;00:13:27,732;forbid it rains.
222;00:13:27,766;00:13:31,002;Why, I might as well sleep
222;00:13:27,766;00:13:31,002;beneath a waterfall.
223;00:13:31,036;00:13:32,671;Maintenance of a Holdfast
224;00:13:32,705;00:13:36,108;generally falls
224;00:13:32,705;00:13:36,108;to the lord of that Holdfast.
225;00:13:36,143;00:13:37,610;Generally, yes,
226;00:13:37,644;00:13:39,311;but I've sent
226;00:13:37,644;00:13:39,311;all the young men off
227;00:13:39,345;00:13:41,247;to fight
227;00:13:39,345;00:13:41,247;Robb Stark's war.
228;00:13:41,281;00:13:44,383;King Robb.
228;00:13:41,281;00:13:44,383;And it's not his war.
229;00:13:44,417;00:13:46,318;He didn't choose it.
230;00:13:46,352;00:13:47,786;Maybe not, My Lord,
231;00:13:47,820;00:13:49,921;but he called in his Banners
231;00:13:47,820;00:13:49,921;and took the men.
232;00:13:49,955;00:13:51,689;Joffrey killed my father,
233;00:13:51,723;00:13:54,158;your liege lord.
234;00:13:54,192;00:13:56,660;Do you remember
234;00:13:54,192;00:13:56,660;your vows, Ser?
235;00:13:56,694;00:13:58,562;Of course I remember!
236;00:13:58,596;00:14:01,665;We can spare four masons
236;00:13:58,596;00:14:01,665;for a week, My Lord.
237;00:14:01,699;00:14:04,735;Will that be sufficient
237;00:14:01,699;00:14:04,735;to repair your walls?
238;00:14:04,769;00:14:07,071;I-- I believe it will.
239;00:14:13,012;00:14:15,381;We didn't want him here
239;00:14:13,012;00:14:15,381;all day, did we?
240;00:14:16,650;00:14:19,685;I didn't like the way
240;00:14:16,650;00:14:19,685;he was talking about Robb.
241;00:14:19,720;00:14:21,520;Nor did I.
242;00:14:23,790;00:14:26,658;But listening to people
242;00:14:23,790;00:14:26,658;you'd rather not listen to
243;00:14:26,693;00:14:30,763;is one of your responsibilities
243;00:14:26,693;00:14:30,763;as Lord of Winterfell.
244;00:14:33,666;00:14:35,934;Lord Portan.
245;00:14:35,968;00:14:39,003;My Lord, may the Old Gods
245;00:14:35,968;00:14:39,003;watch over your brother
246;00:14:39,037;00:14:40,771;and all our northern sons.
247;00:15:29,723;00:15:34,161;Boil this for an hour
247;00:15:29,723;00:15:34,161;and drink the tea.
248;00:15:34,195;00:15:36,698;Makes all your pain
248;00:15:34,195;00:15:36,698;go away.
249;00:15:36,732;00:15:39,367;Don't have any pain.
250;00:15:39,401;00:15:41,001;Lucky for you.
251;00:15:42,070;00:15:43,904;That way.
252;00:15:46,641;00:15:48,876;You've been having
252;00:15:46,641;00:15:48,876;those dreams again.
253;00:15:48,910;00:15:50,744;I don't dream.
254;00:15:50,778;00:15:52,312;Everyone dreams.
255;00:15:52,346;00:15:55,281;I don't.
256;00:15:55,315;00:15:57,383;Heard some of the men
256;00:15:55,315;00:15:57,383;talking about the comet.
257;00:15:57,417;00:15:59,552;They say it's an omen.
258;00:15:59,586;00:16:03,256;They say it means Robb will win
258;00:15:59,586;00:16:03,256;a great victory in the South.
259;00:16:03,290;00:16:04,891;Did they?
260;00:16:06,660;00:16:10,230;I heard some other fools
260;00:16:06,660;00:16:10,230;say it's Lannister Red.
261;00:16:10,265;00:16:13,634;Means the Lannisters will rule
261;00:16:10,265;00:16:13,634;all Seven Kingdoms before long.
262;00:16:13,668;00:16:17,071;Heard a stableboy say
262;00:16:13,668;00:16:17,071;it's the color of blood
263;00:16:17,105;00:16:19,474;to mark the death
263;00:16:17,105;00:16:19,474;of your father.
264;00:16:23,312;00:16:26,547;The stars
264;00:16:23,312;00:16:26,547;don't fall for men.
265;00:16:26,581;00:16:29,149;The red comet means
265;00:16:26,581;00:16:29,149;one thing, boy--
266;00:16:30,284;00:16:31,885;dragons.
267;00:16:33,721;00:16:36,455;The dragons are all dead.
268;00:16:36,490;00:16:38,958;They've been dead
268;00:16:36,490;00:16:38,958;for centuries.
269;00:17:15,496;00:17:17,264;Mmm.
270;00:17:17,298;00:17:20,233;Mmm. Mmm.
271;00:17:22,336;00:17:24,971;What did your brother say
271;00:17:22,336;00:17:24,971;about them, Khaleesi?
272;00:17:25,005;00:17:26,673;He said they ate meat.
273;00:17:26,708;00:17:30,410;He didn't tell you
273;00:17:26,708;00:17:30,410;what kind of meat?
274;00:17:30,444;00:17:33,346;My brother didn't know
274;00:17:30,444;00:17:33,346;anything about dragons.
275;00:17:33,380;00:17:36,515;He didn't know anything
275;00:17:33,380;00:17:36,515;about anything.
276;00:17:41,455;00:17:43,990;Eh.
277;00:18:10,319;00:18:12,387;She was Drogo's
277;00:18:10,319;00:18:12,387;first gift to me.
278;00:18:12,421;00:18:15,423;I remember.
279;00:18:17,292;00:18:19,928;I promised
279;00:18:17,292;00:18:19,928;to protect them.
280;00:18:19,962;00:18:22,296;Promised them their enemies
280;00:18:19,962;00:18:22,296;would die screaming.
281;00:18:22,331;00:18:24,832;How do I make
281;00:18:22,331;00:18:24,832;starvation scream?
282;00:18:24,867;00:18:27,869;A trick I never learned,
282;00:18:24,867;00:18:27,869;I'm afraid.
283;00:18:29,705;00:18:31,772;Does it ever end?
284;00:18:31,807;00:18:33,774;This is farther east
284;00:18:31,807;00:18:33,774;than I've ever been.
285;00:18:33,808;00:18:35,342;But, yes, Khaleesi,
286;00:18:35,377;00:18:36,844;everything ends,
286;00:18:35,377;00:18:36,844;even the red waste.
287;00:18:36,878;00:18:39,446;And you're sure
287;00:18:36,878;00:18:39,446;there's no other way?
288;00:18:39,481;00:18:42,216;If we go south to the land
288;00:18:39,481;00:18:42,216;of the Lazarheen,
289;00:18:42,250;00:18:44,718;the Lamb Men will kill us
289;00:18:42,250;00:18:44,718;and take your dragons.
290;00:18:44,753;00:18:46,653;If we go west
290;00:18:44,753;00:18:46,653;to the Dothraki Sea,
291;00:18:46,688;00:18:48,722;the first
291;00:18:46,688;00:18:48,722;Khalasar we meet
292;00:18:48,756;00:18:50,290;will kill us
292;00:18:48,756;00:18:50,290;and take your dragons.
293;00:18:50,324;00:18:52,993;No one will take
293;00:18:50,324;00:18:52,993;my dragons.
294;00:18:54,162;00:18:56,864;They are too weak to fight,
295;00:18:56,898;00:18:58,899;as are your people.
296;00:18:58,933;00:19:01,269;You must be
296;00:18:58,933;00:19:01,269;their strength.
297;00:19:02,204;00:19:04,339;As you are mine.
298;00:19:51,319;00:19:54,255;Rakharo...
299;00:20:00,763;00:20:03,532;You never have.
300;00:20:08,370;00:20:12,206;This is bad time to start.
301;00:21:08,298;00:21:10,266;Having a rough time of it?
302;00:21:10,300;00:21:11,867;Nothing's killed me yet.
303;00:21:11,902;00:21:14,470;Your ass killed the sledge.
303;00:21:11,902;00:21:14,470;You offered me a ride.
304;00:21:14,505;00:21:17,740;I just wanted you to shut up about
304;00:21:14,505;00:21:17,740;your damn blisters.
305;00:21:31,754;00:21:34,556;I was born in a place
305;00:21:31,754;00:21:34,556;like this.
306;00:21:34,591;00:21:37,726;Later, I fell
306;00:21:34,591;00:21:37,726;on hard times.
307;00:21:39,362;00:21:41,129;Are those girls?
308;00:21:41,163;00:21:42,964;Craster's daughters.
309;00:21:42,999;00:21:46,735;I haven't seen a girl
309;00:21:42,999;00:21:46,735;in six months.
310;00:21:46,769;00:21:48,704;I'd keep on not seeing them
310;00:21:46,769;00:21:48,704;if I were you.
311;00:21:48,738;00:21:52,140;What, he don't like people messing
311;00:21:48,738;00:21:52,140;with his daughters?
312;00:21:52,175;00:21:54,977;He don't like people
312;00:21:52,175;00:21:54,977;messing with his wives.
313;00:21:56,346;00:21:58,580;He marries
313;00:21:56,346;00:21:58,580;his daughters,
314;00:21:58,615;00:22:00,950;and they give him
314;00:21:58,615;00:22:00,950;more daughters.
315;00:22:00,984;00:22:03,185;And on and on it goes.
316;00:22:03,220;00:22:05,654;That's foul.
316;00:22:03,220;00:22:05,654;It's beyond foul.
317;00:22:05,688;00:22:09,592;All the other wildlings for a
317;00:22:05,688;00:22:09,592;hundred leagues have disappeared.
318;00:22:09,626;00:22:11,593;Craster's still here.
319;00:22:11,628;00:22:14,263;He must be doing
319;00:22:11,628;00:22:14,263;something right.
320;00:22:15,899;00:22:17,600;What happens
320;00:22:15,899;00:22:17,600;to the boys?
321;00:22:17,634;00:22:20,669;Hmm?
321;00:22:17,634;00:22:20,669;He marries his daughters.
322;00:22:20,704;00:22:23,606;What does he do
322;00:22:20,704;00:22:23,606;with his sons?
323;00:22:25,943;00:22:28,644;He said he planned
323;00:22:25,943;00:22:28,644;to stop here
324;00:22:28,679;00:22:30,246;on his way
324;00:22:28,679;00:22:30,246;to the Frostfangs.
325;00:22:30,280;00:22:31,881;People make
325;00:22:30,280;00:22:31,881;all sorts of plans.
326;00:22:31,915;00:22:35,351;I haven't seen Benjen Stark
326;00:22:31,915;00:22:35,351;in three years.
327;00:22:35,385;00:22:36,852;Haven't missed him.
328;00:22:36,887;00:22:39,622;Always treated me
328;00:22:36,887;00:22:39,622;like scum.
329;00:22:40,891;00:22:43,526;Haven't had any good wine
329;00:22:40,891;00:22:43,526;for a long time.
330;00:22:43,560;00:22:46,562;You Southerners make good wine,
330;00:22:43,560;00:22:46,562;I'll give you that.
331;00:22:46,596;00:22:48,631;We're not Southerners.
332;00:22:48,666;00:22:50,400;Who's this little girl?
333;00:22:51,869;00:22:54,671;You're prettier
333;00:22:51,869;00:22:54,671;than half my daughters.
334;00:22:54,706;00:22:58,041;You got a nice wet twat
334;00:22:54,706;00:22:58,041;between your legs?
335;00:22:58,075;00:22:59,809;What's your name?
336;00:22:59,844;00:23:01,844;Jon Snow.
336;00:22:59,844;00:23:01,844;Snow, eh?
337;00:23:01,879;00:23:04,713;Listen to me, bastard.
338;00:23:04,748;00:23:08,717;All you lot from south of the Wall,
338;00:23:04,748;00:23:08,717;you're Southerners.
339;00:23:08,751;00:23:12,621;But now you're in the North,
339;00:23:08,751;00:23:12,621;the real North.
340;00:23:12,655;00:23:14,255;The lad meant no harm.
341;00:23:15,758;00:23:18,993;I catch that pretty little bastard
341;00:23:15,758;00:23:18,993;talking to my daughters--
342;00:23:19,028;00:23:23,165;No one will talk to your daughters,
342;00:23:19,028;00:23:23,165;you have my word.
343;00:23:23,199;00:23:26,536;Now, sit down
343;00:23:23,199;00:23:26,536;and shut your mouth.
344;00:23:29,240;00:23:31,542;You bring any of that
344;00:23:29,240;00:23:31,542;good wine with you?
345;00:23:31,576;00:23:33,411;We did.
346;00:23:33,445;00:23:35,947;We passed through
346;00:23:33,445;00:23:35,947;six villages on the way here.
347;00:23:35,981;00:23:37,815;All six were abandoned.
348;00:23:37,850;00:23:40,918;Where have all
348;00:23:37,850;00:23:40,918;the wildlings gone?
349;00:23:40,952;00:23:44,488;I could tell you,
349;00:23:40,952;00:23:44,488;but I'm thirsty.
350;00:23:44,522;00:23:46,624;There's a barrel of
350;00:23:44,522;00:23:46,624;Dornish wine on the sledge.
351;00:23:46,658;00:23:49,393;Bring it in here.
351;00:23:46,658;00:23:49,393;- Yes, commander.
352;00:23:49,427;00:23:52,596;You want to know
352;00:23:49,427;00:23:52,596;where they've all gone?
353;00:23:52,630;00:23:56,933;North... to join up
353;00:23:52,630;00:23:56,933;with Mance Rayder...
354;00:23:58,102;00:23:59,835;Your old friend.
355;00:23:59,870;00:24:02,505;He's no friend of mine.
356;00:24:02,540;00:24:05,672;He broke his vows,
356;00:24:02,540;00:24:05,672;betrayed his brothers.
357;00:24:05,697;00:24:06,897;Oh, aye.
358;00:24:07,011;00:24:10,081;But once he was
358;00:24:07,011;00:24:10,081;just a poor black crow.
359;00:24:10,115;00:24:13,051;And now he's
359;00:24:10,115;00:24:13,051;King-Beyond-the-Wall.
360;00:24:13,086;00:24:15,554;He's been calling
360;00:24:13,086;00:24:15,554;himself that for years.
361;00:24:15,588;00:24:19,325;What's he king of?
361;00:24:15,588;00:24:19,325;A frozen lake somewhere?
362;00:24:20,694;00:24:22,762;That's a good-looking axe.
363;00:24:22,796;00:24:24,931;Fresh forged?
364;00:24:26,934;00:24:29,469;Give it here.
365;00:24:29,503;00:24:31,671;You'll have another one
365;00:24:29,503;00:24:31,671;made at Castle Black.
366;00:24:31,706;00:24:33,607;Here.
367;00:24:33,641;00:24:37,444;Oh, that's some
367;00:24:33,641;00:24:37,444;lovely steel.
368;00:24:41,148;00:24:44,284;You want to know
368;00:24:41,148;00:24:44,284;what Mance Rayder is doing?
369;00:24:44,318;00:24:46,119;Gathering an army.
370;00:24:46,187;00:24:48,388;What I hear,
370;00:24:46,187;00:24:48,388;he's already got more men
371;00:24:48,422;00:24:50,724;than any of your
371;00:24:48,422;00:24:50,724;southern kings.
372;00:24:50,758;00:24:53,260;And where does he plan
372;00:24:50,758;00:24:53,260;marching this army?
373;00:24:53,294;00:24:54,761;When you're
373;00:24:53,294;00:24:54,761;all the way north,
374;00:24:54,795;00:24:56,530;there's only
374;00:24:54,795;00:24:56,530;one direction to go.
375;00:24:58,733;00:25:03,370;These are bad times to be
375;00:24:58,733;00:25:03,370;living alone in the wild.
376;00:25:03,405;00:25:06,707;The cold winds
376;00:25:03,405;00:25:06,707;are rising.
377;00:25:06,742;00:25:10,244;Let them come.
377;00:25:06,742;00:25:10,244;My roots are sunk deep.
378;00:25:11,747;00:25:13,747;Wife...
379;00:25:13,782;00:25:17,818;tell the Lord Crow
379;00:25:13,782;00:25:17,818;how content we are.
380;00:25:17,852;00:25:20,220;This is our place.
381;00:25:20,254;00:25:22,155;Our husband keeps us safe.
382;00:25:22,190;00:25:25,359;Better to live free
382;00:25:22,190;00:25:25,359;than die a slave.
383;00:25:27,128;00:25:30,631;Don't it make you
383;00:25:27,128;00:25:30,631;jealous, old man,
384;00:25:30,665;00:25:32,733;to see me with
384;00:25:30,665;00:25:32,733;all these young wives
385;00:25:32,767;00:25:36,036;and you with no one
385;00:25:32,767;00:25:36,036;to warm your bed?
386;00:25:36,070;00:25:38,005;We chose different paths.
387;00:25:38,039;00:25:42,476;Oh, aye, and you chose the path
387;00:25:38,039;00:25:42,476;with no one but boys on it.
388;00:25:44,345;00:25:47,480;You'll be wanting to sleep
388;00:25:44,345;00:25:47,480;beneath my roof, I suppose,
389;00:25:47,515;00:25:49,582;and eat me out of pigs.
390;00:25:49,617;00:25:51,518;A roof would be welcome.
391;00:25:51,552;00:25:53,086;It's been hard riding.
392;00:25:53,120;00:25:56,322;We've brought our own food
392;00:25:53,120;00:25:56,322;and good steel for you.
393;00:25:58,926;00:26:01,661;Any man lays a hand
393;00:25:58,926;00:26:01,661;on one of my wives,
394;00:26:01,695;00:26:04,664;he loses the hand.
395;00:26:06,500;00:26:10,302;And I see this one
395;00:26:06,500;00:26:10,302;staring too long,
396;00:26:10,337;00:26:13,572;I might just gouge
396;00:26:10,337;00:26:13,572;his eyes out.
397;00:26:13,606;00:26:16,876;Your roof, your rules.
398;00:26:29,858;00:26:32,159;Who am I?!
399;00:26:32,194;00:26:35,630;Who am I?!
399;00:26:32,194;00:26:35,630;Lord commander.
400;00:26:35,664;00:26:38,833;And who are you?
400;00:26:35,664;00:26:38,833;Jon Snow.
401;00:26:38,867;00:26:41,469;Who are you?
402;00:26:41,503;00:26:43,771;Your steward.
403;00:26:43,805;00:26:45,906;You want to lead
403;00:26:43,805;00:26:45,906;one day?
404;00:26:48,676;00:26:51,411;Then learn
404;00:26:48,676;00:26:51,411;how to follow.
405;00:27:08,930;00:27:13,667;Lord of Light, come to us
405;00:27:08,930;00:27:13,667;in our darkness.
406;00:27:13,701;00:27:17,405;We offer you
406;00:27:13,701;00:27:17,405;these false Gods.
407;00:27:17,439;00:27:20,374;Take them and cast
407;00:27:17,439;00:27:20,374;your light upon us...
408;00:27:22,077;00:27:26,113;For the night is dark
408;00:27:22,077;00:27:26,113;and full of terrors.
409;00:27:26,147;00:27:29,649;For the night is dark
409;00:27:26,147;00:27:29,649;and full of terrors.
410;00:27:31,618;00:27:33,552;After the long summer,
411;00:27:33,586;00:27:36,622;darkness will fall heavy
411;00:27:33,586;00:27:36,622;on the world.
412;00:27:36,656;00:27:39,358;The stars will bleed.
413;00:27:39,392;00:27:41,761;We need to stop her.
414;00:27:41,795;00:27:45,598;The cold breath of winter
414;00:27:41,795;00:27:45,598;will freeze the seas...
415;00:27:45,632;00:27:47,030;Not now.
416;00:27:47,055;00:27:48,255;...And the dead shall rise
416;00:27:47,055;00:27:48,255;in the North.
417;00:27:51,805;00:27:55,375;All you men were named
417;00:27:51,805;00:27:55,375;in the Light of the Seven!
418;00:27:55,410;00:27:58,545;Is this how you treat
418;00:27:55,410;00:27:58,545;the Gods of your fathers?
419;00:27:58,580;00:28:03,283;Are you so eager to spit
419;00:27:58,580;00:28:03,283;on your ancestors?
420;00:28:11,858;00:28:14,292;You smell of fear--
421;00:28:14,360;00:28:18,596;fear and piss
421;00:28:14,360;00:28:18,596;and old bones.
422;00:28:19,831;00:28:21,532;Do you want to stop me?
423;00:28:25,971;00:28:27,838;Stop me.
424;00:28:40,653;00:28:42,387;In the ancient books,
424;00:28:40,653;00:28:42,387;it's written
425;00:28:42,422;00:28:46,458;that a warrior will draw
425;00:28:42,422;00:28:46,458;a burning sword from the fire.
426;00:28:47,594;00:28:50,662;And that sword shall be
426;00:28:47,594;00:28:50,662;Lightbringer.
427;00:28:55,469;00:28:58,971;Stannis Baratheon,
428;00:28:59,005;00:29:01,573;warrior of light,
429;00:29:01,608;00:29:03,509;your sword awaits you.
430;00:29:33,775;00:29:37,244;Lord, cast your
430;00:29:33,775;00:29:37,244;light upon us!
431;00:29:38,779;00:29:42,115;For the night is dark
431;00:29:38,779;00:29:42,115;and full of terrors.
432;00:29:44,952;00:29:48,421;For the night is dark
432;00:29:44,952;00:29:48,421;and full of terror.
433;00:30:15,483;00:30:19,118;This woman will lead him
433;00:30:15,483;00:30:19,118;into a war he cannot win.
434;00:30:19,153;00:30:20,786;Stannis is our king.
435;00:30:20,821;00:30:22,154;We follow
435;00:30:20,821;00:30:22,154;where he leads,
436;00:30:22,189;00:30:24,890;even if we don't like the path.
436;00:30:22,189;00:30:24,890;King.
437;00:30:24,924;00:30:27,025;Since that boar
437;00:30:24,924;00:30:27,025;killed his brother,
438;00:30:27,060;00:30:29,094;every lord wants
438;00:30:27,060;00:30:29,094;a coronation.
439;00:30:29,128;00:30:31,229;I don't serve the others.
439;00:30:29,128;00:30:31,229;I serve Stannis.
440;00:30:31,264;00:30:34,966;As do I,
440;00:30:31,264;00:30:34,966;but loyal service
441;00:30:35,000;00:30:37,936;means telling
441;00:30:35,000;00:30:37,936;hard truths.
442;00:30:37,970;00:30:42,039;He's surrounded
442;00:30:37,970;00:30:42,039;by fools and fanatics,
443;00:30:42,074;00:30:44,842;but he trusts you, Davos.
444;00:30:44,877;00:30:47,979;If you tell him
444;00:30:44,877;00:30:47,979;the truth...
445;00:30:49,382;00:30:51,317;What's the truth?
446;00:31:03,964;00:31:05,765;And I declare upon
446;00:31:03,964;00:31:05,765;the honor of my house
447;00:31:05,799;00:31:07,233;that my beloved

448;00:31:07,267;00:31:09,869;he wasn't
448;00:31:07,267;00:31:09,869;my beloved brother.
449;00:31:09,903;00:31:12,104;I didn't love him.
449;00:31:09,903;00:31:12,104;He didn't love me.
450;00:31:12,139;00:31:13,973;A harmless courtesy,
450;00:31:12,139;00:31:13,973;Your Grace.
451;00:31:14,007;00:31:15,374;A lie.
451;00:31:14,007;00:31:15,374;Take it out.
452;00:31:18,311;00:31:20,212;...that my brother Robert
452;00:31:18,311;00:31:20,212;left no trueborn heirs,
453;00:31:20,246;00:31:22,648;the boy Joffrey,

454;00:31:22,682;00:31:24,850;being born of incest
455;00:31:24,885;00:31:27,888;between Cersei Lannister and
455;00:31:24,885;00:31:27,888;her brother Jaime Lannister.
456;00:31:27,922;00:31:30,824;By right of birth--
456;00:31:27,922;00:31:30,824;Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.
457;00:31:30,858;00:31:33,660;Call him what he is.
458;00:31:33,695;00:31:35,195;...And her brother

459;00:31:35,230;00:31:36,597;the Kingslayer.
460;00:31:36,632;00:31:39,868;By right of birth and blood,
460;00:31:36,632;00:31:39,868;i do this day lay claim--
461;00:31:39,902;00:31:43,037;Make it Ser Jaime Lannister,
461;00:31:39,902;00:31:43,037;the Kingslayer.
462;00:31:43,072;00:31:45,273;Whatever else he is,
462;00:31:43,072;00:31:45,273;the man's still a knight.
463;00:31:45,308;00:31:47,342;Ser Jaime Lannister,
463;00:31:45,308;00:31:47,342;the Kingslayer.

465;00:31:49,745;00:31:53,182;to the Iron Throne of Westeros.
466;00:31:53,216;00:31:55,717;Let all true men
466;00:31:53,216;00:31:55,717;declare their loyalty.
467;00:31:55,752;00:31:58,086;When Eddard Stark learned
467;00:31:55,752;00:31:58,086;the truth, he told only me.

472;00:32:07,463;00:32:09,931;as an excuse.

474;00:32:12,602;00:32:14,636;make peace with your brother--
475;00:32:14,670;00:32:16,938;I'll not make peace with Renly
475;00:32:14,670;00:32:16,938;while he calls himself King.
476;00:32:16,973;00:32:18,807;Well, many have already
476;00:32:16,973;00:32:18,807;declared for him--

478;00:32:21,011;00:32:24,246;Stannis does not need to beg
478;00:32:21,011;00:32:24,246;this lord or that lord for support.
479;00:32:24,280;00:32:25,848;The Lord of Light
479;00:32:24,280;00:32:25,848;stands behind him.
480;00:32:25,882;00:32:29,351;And how many ships has
480;00:32:25,882;00:32:29,351;the Lord of Light got in his fleet?
481;00:32:29,386;00:32:31,954;He has no need for ships.
481;00:32:29,386;00:32:31,954;I'm sure he doesn't,
482;00:32:31,988;00:32:33,389;but we do if we're
482;00:32:31,988;00:32:33,389;going to war.
483;00:32:33,423;00:32:36,492;If not Renly, Your Grace,
483;00:32:33,423;00:32:36,492;join forces with Robb Stark.
484;00:32:36,526;00:32:38,828;Who would steal
484;00:32:36,526;00:32:38,828;the northern half of my kingdom.
485;00:32:38,862;00:32:40,163;I've always served thieves

488;00:32:45,402;00:32:47,870;or I'll destroy them.
489;00:32:47,904;00:32:52,474;I owe you
489;00:32:47,904;00:32:52,474;an apology, my King.

492;00:32:58,715;00:33:02,217;May the Lord of Light
492;00:32:58,715;00:33:02,217;watch over us all.
493;00:33:02,252;00:33:04,619;Shall we drink together?
494;00:33:04,654;00:33:06,655;Don't.
495;00:33:06,689;00:33:11,494;A cup of wine to honor
495;00:33:06,689;00:33:11,494;the one true God.
496;00:33:57,611;00:34:00,813;The night is dark and full
496;00:33:57,611;00:34:00,813;of terrors, old man,
497;00:34:00,848;00:34:04,083;but the fire
497;00:34:00,848;00:34:04,083;burns them all away.
498;00:34:25,639;00:34:27,640;Your Grace.
499;00:34:39,020;00:34:41,689;King in the North.
500;00:34:43,625;00:34:45,426;I keep expecting you
500;00:34:43,625;00:34:45,426;to leave me
501;00:34:45,461;00:34:47,495;in one castle or another
501;00:34:45,461;00:34:47,495;for safekeeping,
502;00:34:47,530;00:34:51,566;but you drag me along
502;00:34:47,530;00:34:51,566;from camp to camp.
503;00:34:51,600;00:34:54,235;Have you grown
503;00:34:51,600;00:34:54,235;fond of me, Stark?
504;00:34:54,270;00:34:56,070;Is that it?
505;00:34:56,105;00:34:58,106;I've never seen you
505;00:34:56,105;00:34:58,106;with a girl.
506;00:34:59,208;00:35:01,643;If I left you with
506;00:34:59,208;00:35:01,643;one of my bannermen,
507;00:35:01,677;00:35:04,713;your father would know
507;00:35:01,677;00:35:04,713;within a fortnight
508;00:35:04,747;00:35:08,217;and my bannerman would receive
508;00:35:04,747;00:35:08,217;a raven with a message:
509;00:35:08,251;00:35:11,820;Release my son and you'll be rich
509;00:35:08,251;00:35:11,820;beyond your dreams.
510;00:35:11,855;00:35:15,391;Refuse and your house
510;00:35:11,855;00:35:15,391;will be destroyed, root and stem.
511;00:35:15,425;00:35:17,726;You don't trust
511;00:35:15,425;00:35:17,726;the loyalty
512;00:35:17,761;00:35:20,062;of the men following
512;00:35:17,761;00:35:20,062;you into battle?
513;00:35:20,097;00:35:23,600;Oh, I trust them
513;00:35:20,097;00:35:23,600;with my life,
514;00:35:23,634;00:35:25,635;just not with yours.
515;00:35:25,669;00:35:27,503;Smart boy.
516;00:35:27,538;00:35:29,172;What's wrong?
517;00:35:29,206;00:35:31,173;Don't like
517;00:35:29,206;00:35:31,173;being called boy?
518;00:35:32,108;00:35:34,143;Insulted?
519;00:35:41,117;00:35:43,985;You insult yourself,
519;00:35:41,117;00:35:43,985;Kingslayer.
520;00:35:45,654;00:35:49,056;You've been defeated by a boy.
521;00:35:49,091;00:35:51,558;You're held captive
521;00:35:49,091;00:35:51,558;by a boy.
522;00:35:53,661;00:35:56,263;Perhaps you'll be
522;00:35:53,661;00:35:56,263;killed by a boy.
523;00:36:03,004;00:36:04,772;Stannis Baratheon
523;00:36:03,004;00:36:04,772;sent ravens
524;00:36:04,807;00:36:08,176;to all the high lords
524;00:36:04,807;00:36:08,176;of Westeros.
525;00:36:08,211;00:36:11,881;King Joffrey Baratheon
525;00:36:08,211;00:36:11,881;is neither a true king
526;00:36:11,915;00:36:14,550;nor a true Baratheon.
527;00:36:14,585;00:36:16,719;He's your bastard son.
528;00:36:16,754;00:36:19,323;If that's true,
528;00:36:16,754;00:36:19,323;Stannis is the rightful king.
529;00:36:19,357;00:36:21,391;How convenient for him.
530;00:36:21,425;00:36:25,695;My father learned
530;00:36:21,425;00:36:25,695;the truth.
531;00:36:25,730;00:36:27,397;That's why
531;00:36:25,730;00:36:27,397;you had him executed.
532;00:36:27,432;00:36:29,800;I was your prisoner
532;00:36:27,432;00:36:29,800;when Ned Stark lost his head.
533;00:36:29,834;00:36:31,936;Your son killed him
534;00:36:31,970;00:36:33,404;so the world wouldn't
534;00:36:31,970;00:36:33,404;learn who fathered him.
535;00:36:33,438;00:36:37,475;And you-- you pushed
535;00:36:33,438;00:36:37,475;my brother from a window
536;00:36:37,509;00:36:39,477;because he saw you
536;00:36:37,509;00:36:39,477;with the queen.
537;00:36:44,650;00:36:47,686;You have proof?
538;00:36:47,720;00:36:50,222;Or do you want to trade gossip
538;00:36:47,720;00:36:50,222;like a couple of fishwives?
539;00:36:50,257;00:36:52,425;I'm sending one of your cousins
539;00:36:50,257;00:36:52,425;down to King's Landing
540;00:36:52,460;00:36:54,094;with my peace terms.
541;00:36:54,128;00:36:57,164;You think my father's going
541;00:36:54,128;00:36:57,164;to negotiate with you?
542;00:36:57,198;00:36:59,600;You don't know him
542;00:36:57,198;00:36:59,600;very well.
543;00:36:59,634;00:37:04,004;No, but he's starting
543;00:36:59,634;00:37:04,004;to know me.
544;00:37:04,038;00:37:07,673;Three victories
544;00:37:04,038;00:37:07,673;don't make you a conqueror.
545;00:37:09,142;00:37:11,777;It's better than
545;00:37:09,142;00:37:11,777;three defeats.
546;00:37:40,209;00:37:42,810;This city stinks...
547;00:37:45,214;00:37:46,781;Like dead bodies.
548;00:37:46,815;00:37:48,949;A bit corpsey, yes.
549;00:37:48,983;00:37:51,451;And shit.
550;00:37:51,486;00:37:53,386;I thought you wanted
550;00:37:51,486;00:37:53,386;to come here.
551;00:37:56,723;00:37:59,091;I love it.
552;00:37:59,125;00:38:02,795;You love the smell
552;00:37:59,125;00:38:02,795;of dead bodies and shit?
553;00:38:02,829;00:38:05,865;And cum and garlic
553;00:38:02,829;00:38:05,865;and rum.
554;00:38:05,899;00:38:09,035;You can smell cum
554;00:38:05,899;00:38:09,035;from the balcony?
555;00:38:09,069;00:38:12,406;I love the stink.
555;00:38:09,069;00:38:12,406;I love the noise.
556;00:38:12,440;00:38:14,542;Cities make me
556;00:38:12,440;00:38:14,542;want to fuck.
557;00:38:14,576;00:38:17,879;And so did the country.
558;00:38:20,983;00:38:22,483;This is where I belong.
559;00:38:22,518;00:38:25,386;Yes, well, you need
559;00:38:22,518;00:38:25,386;to be careful.
560;00:38:25,420;00:38:26,987;No one can know
560;00:38:25,420;00:38:26,987;you're here.
561;00:38:27,022;00:38:28,689;No one will know.
562;00:38:28,723;00:38:30,290;You can't trust anyone
562;00:38:28,723;00:38:30,290;in King's Landing.
563;00:38:30,325;00:38:33,493;They're all liars--
563;00:38:30,325;00:38:33,493;good liars, bad liars,
564;00:38:33,528;00:38:35,962;one or two great liars.
565;00:38:35,996;00:38:37,997;What about you?
566;00:38:38,031;00:38:40,666;Me? I'm not from here.
566;00:38:38,031;00:38:40,666;I'm a slave to the truth.
567;00:38:40,700;00:38:43,502;Truth?
568;00:38:45,305;00:38:48,474;You are the biggest
568;00:38:45,305;00:38:48,474;little liar I have ever met.
569;00:38:48,508;00:38:50,509;Why do you think
569;00:38:48,508;00:38:50,509;I am so little?
570;00:38:50,543;00:38:55,079;I'm being crushed beneath the
570;00:38:50,543;00:38:55,079;weight of all that truth.
571;00:38:57,249;00:38:59,216;Oh!
572;00:38:59,251;00:39:02,053;Ned Stark actually
572;00:38:59,251;00:39:02,053;slept on this.
573;00:39:02,087;00:39:05,924;As if the poor man
573;00:39:02,087;00:39:05,924;didn't suffer enough.
574;00:39:07,727;00:39:11,197;One of the many changes
574;00:39:07,727;00:39:11,197;we'll have to make around here.
575;00:39:22,375;00:39:25,677;Lord Baelish.
575;00:39:22,375;00:39:25,677;Your Grace.
576;00:39:25,712;00:39:28,280;I wonder if I might
576;00:39:25,712;00:39:28,280;ask you for a favor.
577;00:39:28,314;00:39:29,815;Of course,
577;00:39:28,314;00:39:29,815;Your Grace.
578;00:39:29,849;00:39:31,783;Ned Stark's youngest
578;00:39:29,849;00:39:31,783;daughter Arya--
579;00:39:31,818;00:39:34,019;we can't seem
579;00:39:31,818;00:39:34,019;to locate her.
580;00:39:34,053;00:39:36,554;If she's escaped
580;00:39:34,053;00:39:36,554;the capital,
581;00:39:36,589;00:39:38,656;Winterfell seems
581;00:39:36,589;00:39:38,656;the logical destination.
582;00:39:38,690;00:39:41,226;And yet my friends in the North
582;00:39:38,690;00:39:41,226;report no sign of her.
583;00:39:41,260;00:39:43,194;Curious.
584;00:39:43,229;00:39:45,363;If we choose to negotiate
584;00:39:43,229;00:39:45,363;with the Starks,
585;00:39:45,398;00:39:47,666;the girl has some value.
585;00:39:45,398;00:39:47,666;Whoever finds her--
586;00:39:47,700;00:39:50,235;well, you know what they say about
586;00:39:47,700;00:39:50,235;Lannisters and debts.
587;00:39:50,270;00:39:52,271;Well, you could ask
587;00:39:50,270;00:39:52,271;Varys where she is.
588;00:39:52,306;00:39:54,607;He'll have
588;00:39:52,306;00:39:54,607;an answer for you.
589;00:39:54,642;00:39:56,209;Whether you believe it...
590;00:39:56,243;00:40:00,114;Myself, I have always had
590;00:39:56,243;00:40:00,114;a hard time trusting eunuchs.
591;00:40:00,148;00:40:02,783;Who knows what they want?
592;00:40:02,817;00:40:05,919;A mockingbird.
593;00:40:05,954;00:40:07,713;You created your
593;00:40:05,954;00:40:07,713;own Sigil, didn't you?
594;00:40:07,738;00:40:08,938;Yes.
595;00:40:09,490;00:40:11,792;Appropriate...
595;00:40:09,490;00:40:11,792;for a self-made man
596;00:40:11,826;00:40:13,560;with so many
596;00:40:11,826;00:40:13,560;songs to sing.
597;00:40:13,594;00:40:15,228;I'm glad you like it.
598;00:40:15,263;00:40:17,131;Some people are
598;00:40:15,263;00:40:17,131;fortunate enough
599;00:40:17,165;00:40:18,798;to be born into
599;00:40:17,165;00:40:18,798;the right family.
600;00:40:18,833;00:40:21,501;Others have to find
600;00:40:18,833;00:40:21,501;their own way.
601;00:40:22,870;00:40:24,904;I heard a song once
602;00:40:24,938;00:40:27,573;about a boy
602;00:40:24,938;00:40:27,573;of modest means
603;00:40:27,607;00:40:31,343;who found his way into the
603;00:40:27,607;00:40:31,343;home of a very prominent family.
604;00:40:31,377;00:40:33,145;He loved
604;00:40:31,377;00:40:33,145;the eldest daughter.
605;00:40:33,179;00:40:36,582;Sadly, she had eyes
605;00:40:33,179;00:40:36,582;for another.
606;00:40:36,616;00:40:38,984;When boys and girls
606;00:40:36,616;00:40:38,984;live in the same home,
607;00:40:39,018;00:40:41,653;awkward situations
607;00:40:39,018;00:40:41,653;can arise.
608;00:40:41,687;00:40:44,322;Sometimes, I've heard,
608;00:40:41,687;00:40:44,322;even brothers and sisters
609;00:40:44,356;00:40:46,857;develop
609;00:40:44,356;00:40:46,857;certain affections.
610;00:40:46,892;00:40:49,326;And when these affections
610;00:40:46,892;00:40:49,326;become common knowledge,
611;00:40:49,360;00:40:53,229;well, that is an awkward
611;00:40:49,360;00:40:53,229;situation indeed,
612;00:40:53,264;00:40:55,565;especially
612;00:40:53,264;00:40:55,565;in a prominent family.
613;00:40:55,599;00:40:59,035;But prominent families
613;00:40:55,599;00:40:59,035;often forget a simple truth,
614;00:40:59,069;00:41:01,304;I've found.
615;00:41:01,338;00:41:03,473;And which truth is that?
616;00:41:03,507;00:41:07,144;Knowledge is power.
617;00:41:09,314;00:41:11,716;Seize him.
618;00:41:13,552;00:41:15,554;Cut his throat.
619;00:41:16,689;00:41:19,158;Stop. Wait.
620;00:41:19,192;00:41:21,561;I've changed my mind.
620;00:41:19,192;00:41:21,561;Let him go.
621;00:41:24,498;00:41:26,198;Step back three paces.
622;00:41:27,601;00:41:30,002;Turn around.
623;00:41:30,036;00:41:31,703;Close your eyes.
624;00:41:35,909;00:41:38,344;Power is power.
625;00:41:40,079;00:41:41,566;Do see if you can
625;00:41:40,079;00:41:41,566;take some time away from
626;00:41:41,591;00:41:43,505;your coins and your whores
627;00:41:43,850;00:41:45,651;to locate
627;00:41:43,850;00:41:45,651;the Stark girl for me.
628;00:41:45,685;00:41:49,221;I would very much
628;00:41:45,685;00:41:49,221;appreciate it.
629;00:41:59,032;00:42:01,233;You're Ser Alton Lannister?
630;00:42:01,267;00:42:03,836;I am, Your Grace.
631;00:42:03,870;00:42:07,407;I offer your cousins peace
631;00:42:03,870;00:42:07,407;if they meet my terms.
632;00:42:07,441;00:42:11,744;First, your family
632;00:42:07,441;00:42:11,744;must release my sisters.
633;00:42:11,779;00:42:15,447;Second, my father's bones
633;00:42:11,779;00:42:15,447;must be returned to us
634;00:42:15,481;00:42:17,415;so he may rest beside
634;00:42:15,481;00:42:17,415;his brother and sister
635;00:42:17,450;00:42:20,185;in the crypts
635;00:42:17,450;00:42:20,185;beneath Winterfell.
636;00:42:20,219;00:42:22,388;And the remains of all those
636;00:42:20,219;00:42:22,388;who died in his service
637;00:42:22,422;00:42:24,623;must also be returned.
638;00:42:24,658;00:42:27,160;Their families can honor
638;00:42:24,658;00:42:27,160;them with proper funerals.
639;00:42:27,195;00:42:30,263;An honorable request, Your Grace.
639;00:42:27,195;00:42:30,263;Third...
640;00:42:31,933;00:42:34,402;Joffrey and the Queen Regent
640;00:42:31,933;00:42:34,402;must renounce all claim
641;00:42:34,436;00:42:37,038;to dominion of the North.
642;00:42:37,073;00:42:39,274;From this time
642;00:42:37,073;00:42:39,274;till the end of time,
643;00:42:39,309;00:42:41,843;we are a free
643;00:42:39,309;00:42:41,843;and independent kingdom.
644;00:42:41,878;00:42:43,845;The King in the North.
645;00:42:43,880;00:42:46,347;King in the North.
646;00:42:46,382;00:42:47,949;Neither Joffrey
646;00:42:46,382;00:42:47,949;nor any of his men
647;00:42:47,984;00:42:50,218;shall set foot
647;00:42:47,984;00:42:50,218;in our lands again.
648;00:42:50,286;00:42:52,153;If he disregards
648;00:42:50,286;00:42:52,153;this command,
649;00:42:52,188;00:42:55,724;he shall suffer
649;00:42:52,188;00:42:55,724;the same fate as my father,
650;00:42:55,758;00:43:00,061;only I don't need a servant
650;00:42:55,758;00:43:00,061;to do my beheading for me.
651;00:43:00,095;00:43:03,598;These are-- Your Grace,
651;00:43:00,095;00:43:03,598;these are--
652;00:43:03,632;00:43:06,167;these are my terms.
653;00:43:06,201;00:43:09,337;If the Queen Regent and her son
653;00:43:06,201;00:43:09,337;meet them, I'll give them peace.
654;00:43:09,371;00:43:12,340;If not...
655;00:43:12,374;00:43:14,809;I will litter the south
655;00:43:12,374;00:43:14,809;with Lannister dead.
656;00:43:14,844;00:43:17,746;King Joffrey is a Baratheon,
656;00:43:14,844;00:43:17,746;Your Grace.
657;00:43:17,780;00:43:19,581;Oh, is he?
658;00:43:20,784;00:43:24,119;You'll ride at daybreak,
658;00:43:20,784;00:43:24,119;Ser Alton.
659;00:43:24,154;00:43:26,788;That will be all
659;00:43:24,154;00:43:26,788;for tonight.
660;00:43:41,537;00:43:43,672;A word, Your Grace?
661;00:43:45,441;00:43:48,176;You don't have to call me
661;00:43:45,441;00:43:48,176;Your Grace when no one's around.
662;00:43:48,210;00:43:50,913;It's not so bad
662;00:43:48,210;00:43:50,913;once you get used to it.
663;00:43:50,947;00:43:52,781;I'm glad someone's
663;00:43:50,947;00:43:52,781;gotten used to it.
664;00:43:52,815;00:43:56,151;The Lannisters are going to reject
664;00:43:52,815;00:43:56,151;your terms, you know?
665;00:43:56,185;00:43:57,886;Of course they are.
666;00:43:57,920;00:44:00,255;We can fight them
666;00:43:57,920;00:44:00,255;in the fields as long as you like,
667;00:44:00,289;00:44:03,992;but we won't beat them until you
667;00:44:00,289;00:44:03,992;take King's Landing.
668;00:44:05,528;00:44:08,664;And we can't take
668;00:44:05,528;00:44:08,664;King's Landing without ships.
669;00:44:08,698;00:44:11,333;My father has ships and men
669;00:44:08,698;00:44:11,333;who know how to sail them.
670;00:44:11,368;00:44:13,135;Men who fought
670;00:44:11,368;00:44:13,135;my father.
671;00:44:13,170;00:44:15,604;Men who fought King Robert
671;00:44:13,170;00:44:15,604;to free themselves
672;00:44:15,638;00:44:19,442;from the yoke of the South,
672;00:44:15,638;00:44:19,442;just like you're doing now.
673;00:44:20,610;00:44:23,680;I'm his only living son.
674;00:44:23,714;00:44:26,850;He'll listen to me.
674;00:44:23,714;00:44:26,850;I know he will.
675;00:44:29,286;00:44:32,555;I'm not a Stark.
675;00:44:29,286;00:44:32,555;I know that.
676;00:44:32,590;00:44:35,559;But your father raised me
676;00:44:32,590;00:44:35,559;to be an honorable man.
677;00:44:37,328;00:44:39,830;We can avenge him
677;00:44:37,328;00:44:39,830;together.
678;00:44:41,132;00:44:44,101;You don't want
678;00:44:41,132;00:44:44,101;Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
679;00:44:44,135;00:44:46,403;I need his ships.
679;00:44:44,135;00:44:46,403;They say he has 200.
680;00:44:46,438;00:44:50,007;They say a million rats
680;00:44:46,438;00:44:50,007;live in the sewers of King's Landing.
681;00:44:50,041;00:44:51,976;Shall we rally them
681;00:44:50,041;00:44:51,976;to fight for us?
682;00:44:52,010;00:44:53,844;I understand you don't
682;00:44:52,010;00:44:53,844;trust Lord Greyjoy.
683;00:44:53,879;00:44:58,549;I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because
683;00:44:53,879;00:44:58,549;he is not trustworthy.
684;00:44:58,583;00:45:01,218;Your father had to go to war
684;00:44:58,583;00:45:01,218;to end his rebellion.
685;00:45:01,253;00:45:05,123;Yes. And now I'm the one
685;00:45:01,253;00:45:05,123;rebelling against the throne.
686;00:45:05,157;00:45:07,425;Before me, it was father.
687;00:45:07,459;00:45:09,126;You married one rebel
687;00:45:07,459;00:45:09,126;and mothered another.
688;00:45:09,160;00:45:12,163;I mothered more than
688;00:45:09,160;00:45:12,163;just rebels,
689;00:45:12,197;00:45:14,531;a fact you seem
689;00:45:12,197;00:45:14,531;to have forgotten.
690;00:45:14,566;00:45:16,567;If I trade the Kingslayer
690;00:45:14,566;00:45:16,567;for two girls,
691;00:45:16,601;00:45:18,868;my bannermen will string me up
691;00:45:16,601;00:45:18,868;by my feet.
692;00:45:18,903;00:45:22,072;You want to leave Sansa
692;00:45:18,903;00:45:22,072;in the Queen's hands?
693;00:45:22,106;00:45:24,174;And Arya--
694;00:45:24,208;00:45:27,210;I haven't heard
694;00:45:24,208;00:45:27,210;a word about Arya.
695;00:45:27,245;00:45:28,979;What are we fighting for
695;00:45:27,245;00:45:28,979;if not for them?
696;00:45:29,013;00:45:30,614;It's more complicated
696;00:45:29,013;00:45:30,614;than that!
697;00:45:30,648;00:45:32,783;You know it is.
698;00:45:47,233;00:45:50,836;It's time for me
698;00:45:47,233;00:45:50,836;to go home.
699;00:45:50,870;00:45:53,772;I haven't seen Bran
699;00:45:50,870;00:45:53,772;or Rickon in months.
700;00:45:54,741;00:45:57,443;You can't go
700;00:45:54,741;00:45:57,443;to Winterfell.
701;00:45:57,477;00:45:59,445;I beg your pardon?
702;00:45:59,479;00:46:02,614;I'll send Rodrik
702;00:45:59,479;00:46:02,614;to watch over the boys
703;00:46:02,649;00:46:07,185;because tomorrow
703;00:46:02,649;00:46:07,185;you'll ride south to the Stormlands.
704;00:46:07,219;00:46:09,220;Why in the name
704;00:46:07,219;00:46:09,220;of all the Gods--
705;00:46:09,254;00:46:13,157;because I need you to negotiate
705;00:46:09,254;00:46:13,157;with Renly Baratheon.
706;00:46:13,192;00:46:15,326;He's rallied
706;00:46:13,192;00:46:15,326;an army of 100,000.
707;00:46:15,361;00:46:17,095;You know him.
707;00:46:15,361;00:46:17,095;You know his family.
708;00:46:17,129;00:46:19,563;I haven't seen Renly Baratheon
708;00:46:17,129;00:46:19,563;since he was a boy.
709;00:46:19,598;00:46:21,132;You have a hundred
709;00:46:19,598;00:46:21,132;other lords--
710;00:46:21,166;00:46:25,036;Which of these lords
710;00:46:21,166;00:46:25,036;do I trust more than you?
711;00:46:25,070;00:46:27,872;If Renly sides with us,
712;00:46:27,907;00:46:30,341;we'll outnumber them
712;00:46:27,907;00:46:30,341;two to one.
713;00:46:30,375;00:46:33,311;When they feel the jaws beginning
713;00:46:30,375;00:46:33,311;to shut, they'll sue for peace.
714;00:46:33,345;00:46:36,080;We'll get the girls back.
715;00:46:36,114;00:46:39,617;Then we'll all
715;00:46:36,114;00:46:39,617;go home... for good.
716;00:46:46,725;00:46:49,694;I will ride at first light.
717;00:46:58,337;00:47:01,939;We will all be together
717;00:46:58,337;00:47:01,939;again soon, I promise.
718;00:47:06,945;00:47:09,546;You've done so well.
719;00:47:10,849;00:47:14,718;Your father
719;00:47:10,849;00:47:14,718;would be... proud.
720;00:47:22,461;00:47:25,463;Give Lord Renly my regards.
720;00:47:22,461;00:47:25,463;King Renly.
721;00:47:26,799;00:47:29,568;There's a king
721;00:47:26,799;00:47:29,568;in every corner now.
722;00:47:42,515;00:47:45,049;What is all this?
723;00:47:45,084;00:47:47,352;Returning this room
723;00:47:45,084;00:47:47,352;to its proper appearance.
724;00:47:47,386;00:47:50,254;Say what you will about the Targaryens--
724;00:47:47,386;00:47:50,254;they were conquerors.
725;00:47:50,289;00:47:53,124;That is a seat
725;00:47:50,289;00:47:53,124;for a conqueror.
726;00:47:53,158;00:47:56,827;It needs a room to match it,
726;00:47:53,158;00:47:56,827;not vines and flowers.
727;00:47:56,861;00:47:59,229;We can't find Arya Stark.
728;00:47:59,264;00:48:01,398;With luck, she's dead
728;00:47:59,264;00:48:01,398;in a ditch somewhere.
729;00:48:01,432;00:48:03,400;Perhaps. But if not,
729;00:48:01,432;00:48:03,400;we need her.
730;00:48:03,434;00:48:05,769;They'll never give Jaime back
730;00:48:03,434;00:48:05,769;to us for Sansa alone.
731;00:48:05,804;00:48:08,405;I think they might.
731;00:48:05,804;00:48:08,405;They're weak.
732;00:48:08,440;00:48:10,274;They put too much value
732;00:48:08,440;00:48:10,274;on their women.
733;00:48:10,308;00:48:14,144;We need to set our armies
733;00:48:10,308;00:48:14,144;to the task of finding her.
734;00:48:14,179;00:48:16,046;Send out as many men
734;00:48:14,179;00:48:16,046;as we can.
735;00:48:16,081;00:48:17,882;I'm sure if you asked
735;00:48:16,081;00:48:17,882;grandfather--
736;00:48:17,916;00:48:21,919;"The King does not ask;"
736;00:48:17,916;00:48:21,919;He commands.
737;00:48:21,953;00:48:24,822;And my grandfather's
737;00:48:21,953;00:48:24,822;stupidity in the field of battle
738;00:48:24,856;00:48:27,758;is the reason Robb Stark has
738;00:48:24,856;00:48:27,758;Uncle Jaime in the first place.
739;00:48:27,792;00:48:30,493;His life is in danger.
740;00:48:30,528;00:48:32,162;We're at war.
741;00:48:32,196;00:48:35,297;All our lives
741;00:48:32,196;00:48:35,297;are in danger.
742;00:48:38,301;00:48:41,804;I heard a disgusting lie
742;00:48:38,301;00:48:41,804;about Uncle Jaime.
743;00:48:41,838;00:48:43,472;And you.
744;00:48:44,641;00:48:46,142;Our enemies
744;00:48:44,641;00:48:46,142;will say anything
745;00:48:46,176;00:48:48,177;to weaken your claim
745;00:48:46,176;00:48:48,177;to the throne.
746;00:48:48,212;00:48:50,347;It's not a claim.
746;00:48:48,212;00:48:50,347;The throne is mine.
747;00:48:51,649;00:48:53,751;Of course it is.
748;00:48:55,721;00:48:57,622;No one believes
748;00:48:55,721;00:48:57,622;this foul gossip.
749;00:48:57,656;00:48:59,791;Someone believes it.
750;00:49:01,127;00:49:03,761;Father had
750;00:49:01,127;00:49:03,761;other children?
751;00:49:03,796;00:49:06,331;Besides me and Tommen
751;00:49:03,796;00:49:06,331;and Myrcella?
752;00:49:08,134;00:49:10,101;What are you asking?
753;00:49:10,135;00:49:12,537;I'm asking if he fucked
753;00:49:10,135;00:49:12,537;other women
754;00:49:12,572;00:49:14,106;when he grew tired
754;00:49:12,572;00:49:14,106;of you.
755;00:49:14,140;00:49:15,941;How many bastards
755;00:49:14,140;00:49:15,941;does he have running--
756;00:49:31,690;00:49:35,926;What you just did
756;00:49:31,690;00:49:35,926;is punishable by death.
757;00:49:39,363;00:49:42,065;You will never
757;00:49:39,363;00:49:42,065;do it again.
758;00:49:42,133;00:49:44,034;Never.
759;00:49:50,074;00:49:52,175;That will be all,
759;00:49:50,074;00:49:52,175;Mother.
760;00:49:58,783;00:50:00,884;No, no, no, no.
761;00:50:00,919;00:50:03,721;Do you have any idea
761;00:50:00,919;00:50:03,721;how ridiculous you sound?
762;00:50:03,755;00:50:05,223;Ease into it.
763;00:50:05,257;00:50:08,259;Slowly, with passion.
764;00:50:08,293;00:50:12,030;Oh, yeah.
765;00:50:12,065;00:50:15,934;Go wash yourselves.
765;00:50:12,065;00:50:15,934;Put some clothes on.
766;00:50:15,969;00:50:18,571;Both of you
766;00:50:15,969;00:50:18,571;are working tonight.
767;00:50:22,341;00:50:24,309;We do things
767;00:50:22,341;00:50:24,309;differently here, Daisy.
768;00:50:24,343;00:50:28,312;This isn't some five-copper
768;00:50:24,343;00:50:28,312;bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.
769;00:50:28,346;00:50:30,847;Haystack Hall.
769;00:50:28,346;00:50:30,847;Wherever you're from.
770;00:50:30,882;00:50:32,716;Our establishment
770;00:50:30,882;00:50:32,716;doesn't cater
771;00:50:32,750;00:50:35,518;to ploughmen
771;00:50:32,750;00:50:35,518;and goat herders.
772;00:50:35,552;00:50:37,653;Lord Olsen.
773;00:50:37,687;00:50:39,388;Taste is

775;00:50:41,324;00:50:43,092;Littlefinger.
776;00:50:43,127;00:50:44,560;He doesn't like it.

779;00:50:54,873;00:50:57,441;so that people
779;00:50:54,873;00:50:57,441;will think she's exotic.
780;00:50:57,476;00:51:00,378;She grew up just down the road
780;00:50:57,476;00:51:00,378;in flea bottom.
781;00:51:00,413;00:51:02,981;She's beautiful.
