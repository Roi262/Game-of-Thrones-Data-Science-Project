37;00:03:28,110;00:03:30,177;Then you're stupid.

41;00:03:44,323;00:03:46,858;What are you doing?
41;00:03:44,323;00:03:46,858;They're looking for me.
42;00:03:46,893;00:03:49,794;You in command here?
43;00:03:49,829;00:03:52,764;You're a long way
43;00:03:49,829;00:03:52,764;from home.
44;00:03:52,799;00:03:54,900;I asked you a question.
45;00:03:54,934;00:03:56,702;Aye, you did.
46;00:03:57,704;00:03:59,806;You asked
46;00:03:57,704;00:03:59,806;without manners
47;00:03:59,840;00:04:02,409;and I chose not to answer.
48;00:04:02,443;00:04:05,479;I have a royal warrant
49;00:04:05,514;00:04:09,150;for one of these gutter rats
49;00:04:05,514;00:04:09,150;you're transporting.
50;00:04:11,621;00:04:14,656;Well, the thing is...
51;00:04:14,690;00:04:16,958;These gutter rats belong
51;00:04:14,690;00:04:16,958;to the Night's Watch.
52;00:04:16,993;00:04:20,762;Now, that puts them beyond the
52;00:04:16,993;00:04:20,762;reach of Kings and Queens.
53;00:04:20,797;00:04:22,631;Does it?
54;00:04:23,466;00:04:25,033;It's a funny thing--
55;00:04:25,067;00:04:27,202;people worry so much
55;00:04:25,067;00:04:27,202;about their throats
56;00:04:27,237;00:04:30,606;that they forget
56;00:04:27,237;00:04:30,606;about what's down low.
57;00:04:30,640;00:04:34,844;Now I sharpened this blade
57;00:04:30,640;00:04:34,844;before breakfast.
58;00:04:34,878;00:04:39,248;I could shave a spider's arse
58;00:04:34,878;00:04:39,248;if I wanted to
59;00:04:39,283;00:04:43,253;or I could nick
59;00:04:39,283;00:04:43,253;this artery in your leg.
60;00:04:43,287;00:04:45,856;And once it's nicked,
60;00:04:43,287;00:04:45,856;there's no one around here
61;00:04:45,890;00:04:48,959;who knows
61;00:04:45,890;00:04:48,959;how to unnick it.
62;00:04:49,027;00:04:51,795;We'll just keep that.
63;00:04:53,064;00:04:56,834;Good steel is always
63;00:04:53,064;00:04:56,834;needed on the Wall.
64;00:04:56,868;00:04:58,568;Seems you have
64;00:04:56,868;00:04:58,568;a choice--
65;00:04:58,603;00:05:02,806;you can die here at this crossroads
65;00:04:58,603;00:05:02,806;a long way from home,
66;00:05:02,840;00:05:05,675;or you can go back to your city
66;00:05:02,840;00:05:05,675;and tell your Masters
67;00:05:05,709;00:05:08,711;you didn't find
67;00:05:05,709;00:05:08,711;what you were looking for.
68;00:05:14,485;00:05:16,553;We're looking
68;00:05:14,485;00:05:16,553;for a boy named Gendry.
69;00:05:16,588;00:05:20,157;He carries
69;00:05:16,588;00:05:20,157;a bull's head helmet.
70;00:05:20,191;00:05:24,195;Anyone turning him over
70;00:05:20,191;00:05:24,195;will earn the King's reward.
71;00:05:24,229;00:05:27,198;We'll be back
71;00:05:24,229;00:05:27,198;with more men
72;00:05:27,232;00:05:30,067;and I'll be taking your head
72;00:05:27,232;00:05:30,067;home along with that bastard boy.

79;00:06:07,204;00:06:09,171;You make me wait
79;00:06:07,204;00:06:09,171;a long time,
80;00:06:09,206;00:06:11,441;but your friend
80;00:06:09,206;00:06:11,441;keeps me company.
81;00:06:11,475;00:06:14,544;We were just speaking
81;00:06:11,475;00:06:14,544;of your bravery
82;00:06:14,578;00:06:17,981;in the victory against
82;00:06:14,578;00:06:17,981;the Stark auxiliary forces.
83;00:06:18,049;00:06:21,418;It was quite a battle.
84;00:06:21,452;00:06:24,921;I heard you suffered
84;00:06:21,452;00:06:24,921;a terrible head wound.
85;00:06:24,956;00:06:27,891;The northerners
85;00:06:24,956;00:06:27,891;are such fearsome warriors.
86;00:06:27,926;00:06:30,528;And I tell him
86;00:06:27,926;00:06:30,528;the story of how we meet.
87;00:06:31,530;00:06:33,597;To find so lovely
87;00:06:31,530;00:06:33,597;a creature
88;00:06:33,632;00:06:35,433;working in your
88;00:06:33,632;00:06:35,433;father's kitchens--
89;00:06:35,467;00:06:37,702;it almost beggars belief.
90;00:06:38,838;00:06:40,773;Strange things do happen.
91;00:06:40,807;00:06:43,576;You should taste
91;00:06:40,807;00:06:43,576;her fish pie.
92;00:06:43,610;00:06:45,945;I don't think Lord Varys
92;00:06:43,610;00:06:45,945;likes fish pie.
93;00:06:45,979;00:06:48,948;How can you tell?
93;00:06:45,979;00:06:48,948;I can always tell.
94;00:06:48,983;00:06:51,184;Tyrion: Men like Lord Varys
94;00:06:48,983;00:06:51,184;and I can't let

95;00:06:51,218;00:06:53,386;get the best of us.

98;00:06:58,224;00:07:01,325;to the capital.
99;00:07:01,360;00:07:05,429;Friends are such
99;00:07:01,360;00:07:05,429;an important part of life.
100;00:07:05,463;00:07:07,931;Unfortunate that your father
100;00:07:05,463;00:07:07,931;didn't want her to come.
101;00:07:07,966;00:07:10,500;But rest easy, My Lord.

104;00:07:15,773;00:07:18,242;is legendary...

105;00:07:18,276;00:07:19,676;are concerned.
106;00:07:19,711;00:07:22,179;How unspeakable of me
106;00:07:19,711;00:07:22,179;to go on and on
107;00:07:22,213;00:07:24,448;when all you want
107;00:07:22,213;00:07:24,448;to do is rest.
108;00:07:24,482;00:07:26,617;I will leave you.
109;00:07:28,020;00:07:29,787;Welcome to King's Landing,

110;00:07:29,822;00:07:33,258;by your presence.

111;00:07:33,292;00:07:35,627;My Lord.
112;00:07:39,198;00:07:41,466;I don't like threats.
113;00:07:41,501;00:07:43,769;Who threatened you?
113;00:07:41,501;00:07:43,769;I'm not Ned Stark.
114;00:07:43,803;00:07:45,937;I understand the way
114;00:07:43,803;00:07:45,937;this game is played.
115;00:07:45,972;00:07:47,572;Ned Stark
115;00:07:45,972;00:07:47,572;was a man of honor.
116;00:07:47,607;00:07:49,040;And I am not.
117;00:07:49,075;00:07:52,577;Threaten me again and I'll have
117;00:07:49,075;00:07:52,577;you thrown into the sea.
118;00:07:55,615;00:07:58,016;You might be disappointed
118;00:07:55,615;00:07:58,016;in the results.

121;00:08:03,255;00:08:06,290;and I keep on paddling.
122;00:08:07,326;00:08:08,726;Come, My Lord.
123;00:08:08,760;00:08:11,128;We shouldn't keep
123;00:08:08,760;00:08:11,128;the queen waiting.
124;00:08:17,334;00:08:19,168;Cersei: From this time

126;00:08:21,104;00:08:24,940;but a free and independent
126;00:08:21,104;00:08:24,940;kingdom of the North.
127;00:08:28,610;00:08:31,145;He has more spirit than

128;00:08:31,179;00:08:34,482;You've perfected the art

130;00:08:37,052;00:08:38,753;as a gesture
130;00:08:37,052;00:08:38,753;of good faith.

131;00:08:38,787;00:08:40,822;our reply, cousin?
132;00:08:41,757;00:08:43,925;I will, Your Grace.
133;00:08:43,960;00:08:45,561;Did you see my brother
134;00:08:45,595;00:08:46,996;when you were
134;00:08:45,595;00:08:46,996;the Starks' guest?
135;00:08:47,030;00:08:48,931;Alton:
135;00:08:47,030;00:08:48,931;I did.

139;00:08:58,375;00:09:00,709;Alton: I will, Your Grace.
139;00:08:58,375;00:09:00,709;Safe travels, cousin.

140;00:09:05,048;00:09:07,349;with diplomacy.

141;00:09:07,384;00:09:11,620;A-- a raven flew in this morning
142;00:09:11,654;00:09:14,523;from Castle Black.

144;00:09:16,192;00:09:18,660;That's why they're
144;00:09:16,192;00:09:18,660;called wildlings.
145;00:09:18,695;00:09:21,329;Somewhat less wild
145;00:09:18,695;00:09:21,329;these days.
146;00:09:21,364;00:09:23,165;Seems they've stopped
146;00:09:21,364;00:09:23,165;killing each other
147;00:09:23,199;00:09:26,302;and started following
147;00:09:23,199;00:09:26,302;this King-Beyond-the-Wall.

154;00:09:40,251;00:09:42,820;with them.

157;00:09:48,594;00:09:50,629;attacked him
157;00:09:48,594;00:09:50,629;in his chambers.

160;00:09:56,302;00:09:58,303;Apparently you burn him.
161;00:09:59,539;00:10:01,273;One trip to the Wall
161;00:09:59,539;00:10:01,273;and you come back
162;00:10:01,307;00:10:04,643;believing in grumpkins
162;00:10:01,307;00:10:04,643;and snarks.

164;00:10:08,247;00:10:10,314;a fact for you--
165;00:10:10,349;00:10:11,949;the Night's Watch
165;00:10:10,349;00:10:11,949;is the only thing
166;00:10:11,983;00:10:14,651;that separates us from
166;00:10:11,983;00:10:14,651;what lies beyond the Wall.
167;00:10:14,686;00:10:17,087;I have every confidence
167;00:10:14,686;00:10:17,087;that the brave men

168;00:10:17,122;00:10:19,824;will protect us all.

170;00:10:23,061;00:10:24,728;to have dignity,
171;00:10:24,763;00:10:27,631;they wouldn't make us

175;00:10:35,472;00:10:39,041;the whole bed shook.

177;00:10:48,851;00:10:52,153;Seems a bit greedy for one man
177;00:10:48,851;00:10:52,153;to have so many wives.
178;00:10:52,188;00:10:54,656;Wouldn't two or three
178;00:10:52,188;00:10:54,656;be enough for him?
179;00:10:54,691;00:10:57,593;We were having
179;00:10:54,691;00:10:57,593;a serious discussion.
180;00:10:58,729;00:11:00,830;Would you look at that?
181;00:11:02,166;00:11:05,069;Nothing like the sight
181;00:11:02,166;00:11:05,069;of a woman walking away.

183;00:11:08,006;00:11:09,607;that's nice, too.
184;00:11:09,641;00:11:12,776;Yeah, well, there was
184;00:11:09,641;00:11:12,776;a milkmaid named Violet
185;00:11:12,810;00:11:15,379;on the next farm over
185;00:11:12,810;00:11:15,379;from where I grew up.
186;00:11:15,413;00:11:18,381;We were wrestling together
186;00:11:15,413;00:11:18,381;from the time we were six years old.
187;00:11:18,416;00:11:23,386;And then we got older
187;00:11:18,416;00:11:23,386;and the wrestling, uh...
188;00:11:24,388;00:11:26,622;Changed.

191;00:11:31,160;00:11:33,662;Well, as many times
191;00:11:31,160;00:11:33,662;as I could.
192;00:11:36,866;00:11:39,468;I wish I grew up

202;00:12:14,771;00:12:17,573;Did he frighten you?
202;00:12:14,771;00:12:17,573;You-- you shouldn't touch me.
203;00:12:17,607;00:12:21,177;Oh. Oh, right.
204;00:12:21,211;00:12:22,846;I'm sorry.

382;00:25:11,358;00:25:13,126;the queen's orders.
383;00:25:13,160;00:25:17,664;No, but who else would want to
383;00:25:13,160;00:25:17,664;murder King Robert's bastards?
384;00:25:17,698;00:25:19,332;She's always been
384;00:25:17,698;00:25:19,332;a jealous woman.
385;00:25:19,366;00:25:21,367;You know your sister
385;00:25:19,366;00:25:21,367;better than I do.
386;00:25:21,402;00:25:23,436;You've heard the awful rumors
386;00:25:21,402;00:25:23,436;about my brother and sister?
387;00:25:23,471;00:25:25,105;I don't listen to filth.
388;00:25:25,139;00:25:28,408;That's good of you,
388;00:25:25,139;00:25:28,408;but you have heard them.
389;00:25:28,442;00:25:31,344;I suppose people who do believe

390;00:25:31,378;00:25:34,046;to be better claimants to the throne
390;00:25:31,378;00:25:34,046;than Cersei's children.

393;00:25:39,953;00:25:43,955;slaughtered Ned Stark's men
394;00:25:43,990;00:25:47,825;in the throne room,
394;00:25:43,990;00:25:47,825;did you give the order?
395;00:25:47,860;00:25:49,827;I did.
396;00:25:49,861;00:25:51,562;And I would again.
397;00:25:51,596;00:25:53,397;The man was a traitor.
398;00:25:53,432;00:25:55,400;He tried to buy

399;00:25:55,434;00:25:57,602;The fool.
400;00:25:57,637;00:25:59,771;He had no idea
400;00:25:57,637;00:25:59,771;you were already bought.

404;00:26:08,382;00:26:10,051;I'm denying its existence.
405;00:26:10,085;00:26:13,187;If you think I'll stand here
405;00:26:10,085;00:26:13,187;and take this from you, dwarf--
406;00:26:13,254;00:26:15,956;Dwarf? Mm, you should
406;00:26:13,254;00:26:15,956;have stopped at Imp.
407;00:26:15,991;00:26:18,659;And, yes, you will stand here
407;00:26:15,991;00:26:18,659;and take it from me,
408;00:26:18,694;00:26:21,062;unless you'd like to take it
408;00:26:18,694;00:26:21,062;from my friend here.
409;00:26:22,264;00:26:24,098;I intend to serve
409;00:26:22,264;00:26:24,098;as Hand of the King
410;00:26:24,132;00:26:25,799;until my father
410;00:26:24,132;00:26:25,799;returns from the war.
411;00:26:25,867;00:26:27,934;And seeing as you betrayed

412;00:26:27,969;00:26:30,870;well, I just wouldn't
412;00:26:27,969;00:26:30,870;feel safe with you lurking about.

414;00:26:32,440;00:26:34,208;will not allow this!

417;00:26:39,281;00:26:41,616;We shall hear what Joffrey
417;00:26:39,281;00:26:41,616;has to say about this.
418;00:26:41,650;00:26:44,719;No, we shan't.

421;00:26:53,596;00:26:57,231;a long walk to Castle Black.
422;00:26:57,266;00:26:59,401;I hope you enjoy the Wall.
423;00:26:59,435;00:27:02,303;I found it

633;00:38:52,121;00:38:54,556;we have always been.
634;00:38:59,196;00:39:01,264;You won't stand a chance against
634;00:38:59,196;00:39:01,264;the Lannisters on your own.

737;00:43:44,246;00:43:46,348;( Laughs ) The people.
738;00:43:46,382;00:43:48,150;You think I care?
739;00:43:48,184;00:43:49,852;You might
739;00:43:48,184;00:43:49,852;find it difficult
740;00:43:49,886;00:43:52,755;to rule over millions
740;00:43:49,886;00:43:52,755;who want you dead.
741;00:43:52,789;00:43:54,656;Half the city will starve
741;00:43:52,789;00:43:54,656;when winter comes.
742;00:43:54,691;00:43:56,225;The other half will plot
742;00:43:54,691;00:43:56,225;to overthrow you.
743;00:43:56,259;00:43:59,261;And your gold-plated thugs
743;00:43:56,259;00:43:59,261;just gave them
744;00:43:59,296;00:44:01,097;their rallying cry--
745;00:44:01,131;00:44:03,733;The Queen
745;00:44:01,131;00:44:03,733;slaughters babies.
746;00:44:05,669;00:44:09,305;You don't even have
746;00:44:05,669;00:44:09,305;the decency to deny it.
747;00:44:18,882;00:44:22,385;It wasn't you who gave
747;00:44:18,882;00:44:22,385;the order, was it?
748;00:44:22,420;00:44:24,287;Joffrey didn't
748;00:44:22,420;00:44:24,287;even tell you.
749;00:44:27,025;00:44:28,659;Did he tell you?
750;00:44:28,694;00:44:30,028;I imagine that
750;00:44:28,694;00:44:30,028;would be even worse.
751;00:44:30,062;00:44:32,998;He did what needed
751;00:44:30,062;00:44:32,998;to be done.
752;00:44:33,032;00:44:36,068;You want to be Hand of the King?
752;00:44:33,032;00:44:36,068;You want to rule?
753;00:44:36,102;00:44:38,970;This is what ruling is--
753;00:44:36,102;00:44:38,970;lying on a bed of weeds,
754;00:44:39,005;00:44:41,439;ripping them out
754;00:44:39,005;00:44:41,439;by the root, one by one,
755;00:44:41,473;00:44:43,040;before they strangle you
755;00:44:41,473;00:44:43,040;in your sleep.
756;00:44:43,075;00:44:45,609;I'm no king, but I think there's more
756;00:44:43,075;00:44:45,609;to ruling than that.
757;00:44:45,643;00:44:47,644;I don't care
757;00:44:45,643;00:44:47,644;what you think!
758;00:44:47,679;00:44:49,246;You've never
758;00:44:47,679;00:44:49,246;taken it seriously.
759;00:44:49,280;00:44:51,614;You haven't,
759;00:44:49,280;00:44:51,614;Jaime hasn't.
760;00:44:55,119;00:44:57,153;It's all fallen on me.
761;00:45:01,159;00:45:04,995;As has Jaime repeatedly,
761;00:45:01,159;00:45:04,995;according to Stannis Baratheon.
762;00:45:09,901;00:45:12,336;You're funny.
763;00:45:14,639;00:45:18,209;You've always
763;00:45:14,639;00:45:18,209;been funny...
764;00:45:18,243;00:45:20,178;But none of your jokes
764;00:45:18,243;00:45:20,178;will ever match
765;00:45:20,212;00:45:22,413;the first one, will they?
766;00:45:23,616;00:45:26,317;You remember?
767;00:45:26,352;00:45:28,053;Back when you ripped
767;00:45:26,352;00:45:28,053;my mother open
768;00:45:28,087;00:45:30,788;on your way out of her
768;00:45:28,087;00:45:30,788;and she bled to death?
769;00:45:32,291;00:45:34,959;She was my mother, too.
770;00:45:34,993;00:45:37,061;Mother gone...
771;00:45:38,664;00:45:40,965;For the sake of you.
772;00:45:43,468;00:45:46,971;There's no bigger joke
772;00:45:43,468;00:45:46,971;in the world than that.

777;00:46:13,533;00:46:16,969;Salladhor Saan will join
777;00:46:13,533;00:46:16,969;our fleet-- 30 ships.
778;00:46:17,003;00:46:19,004;His men know
778;00:46:17,003;00:46:19,004;how to fight.
779;00:46:19,039;00:46:22,441;In my experience, pirates
779;00:46:19,039;00:46:22,441;prefer fighting unarmed men.
780;00:46:22,476;00:46:24,110;It does seem
780;00:46:22,476;00:46:24,110;the wiser choice.
781;00:46:24,144;00:46:26,579;There won't be
781;00:46:24,144;00:46:26,579;a choice this time.

783;00:46:29,550;00:46:31,251;is an old friend.

785;00:46:33,287;00:46:35,555;I've never trusted him,
786;00:46:35,590;00:46:39,693;but once he gets the smell of gold,
786;00:46:35,590;00:46:39,693;he never stops.
787;00:46:39,727;00:46:42,963;Well, if he does his job,
787;00:46:39,727;00:46:42,963;he'll have his share.
788;00:46:46,134;00:46:47,735;Leave us.

795;00:47:21,369;00:47:24,805;I told him death by fire
795;00:47:21,369;00:47:24,805;is the purest death.
796;00:47:24,839;00:47:28,042;Why?
796;00:47:24,839;00:47:28,042;Because it is true.
797;00:47:29,010;00:47:30,844;You're troubled, my king.
798;00:47:30,879;00:47:33,046;Yeah.

800;00:47:35,750;00:47:38,719;to burn them, then.
801;00:47:38,753;00:47:40,187;I tell him nothing.
802;00:47:40,221;00:47:43,424;I pray for his commands
802;00:47:40,221;00:47:43,424;and I obey.
