261;00:18:36,649;00:18:38,417;He won't give up
261;00:18:36,649;00:18:38,417;the North so easily.
262;00:18:38,451;00:18:40,252;They won't even know we're
262;00:18:38,451;00:18:40,252;there until it's too late.
263;00:18:40,286;00:18:41,586;What do you
263;00:18:40,286;00:18:41,586;know of it, woman?
264;00:18:41,621;00:18:43,355;I'm a proven warrior.
265;00:18:43,389;00:18:46,491;Your brothers were warriors,
265;00:18:43,389;00:18:46,491;both of them dead
266;00:18:46,525;00:18:50,161;at the hands of those
266;00:18:46,525;00:18:50,161;you seem so eager to protect.
267;00:18:51,830;00:18:53,664;I'm not protecting anyone.
268;00:18:53,698;00:18:55,966;I just wonder
268;00:18:53,698;00:18:55,966;if it's not wiser to wait.
269;00:18:56,001;00:18:59,703;Why risk going against the North
269;00:18:56,001;00:18:59,703;if they would be our allies?
270;00:18:59,737;00:19:02,372;Rise up against them
270;00:18:59,737;00:19:02,372;and they could destroy us.
271;00:19:02,407;00:19:04,842;But if we pledge
271;00:19:02,407;00:19:04,842;fealty to them,
272;00:19:04,877;00:19:06,911;they'll give us
272;00:19:04,877;00:19:06,911;Casterly Rock.
273;00:19:06,945;00:19:09,949;What are our words?
274;00:19:09,983;00:19:11,817;Our words?
275;00:19:14,255;00:19:17,024;We do not sow.
275;00:19:14,255;00:19:17,024;We do not sow.
276;00:19:17,058;00:19:18,826;We are Ironborn.
277;00:19:18,860;00:19:21,695;We're not subjects.
277;00:19:18,860;00:19:21,695;We're not slaves.
278;00:19:21,730;00:19:24,832;We do not plow the fields
278;00:19:21,730;00:19:24,832;or toil in the mine.
279;00:19:24,866;00:19:27,869;We take what is ours.
280;00:19:27,903;00:19:31,406;Your time with the wolves
280;00:19:27,903;00:19:31,406;has made you weak.
281;00:19:35,011;00:19:38,079;You act as if
281;00:19:35,011;00:19:38,079;I volunteered to go.
282;00:19:38,114;00:19:41,082;You gave me away,
282;00:19:38,114;00:19:41,082;if you remember.
283;00:19:41,116;00:19:43,418;The day you bent the knee
283;00:19:41,116;00:19:43,418;to Robert Baratheon.
284;00:19:43,452;00:19:45,720;After he crushed you.
285;00:19:45,754;00:19:47,622;Did you take
285;00:19:45,754;00:19:47,622;what was yours then?
286;00:19:51,560;00:19:53,261;You gave me away!
287;00:19:54,363;00:19:56,431;Your boy!
288;00:19:56,465;00:19:58,834;Your last boy!
289;00:19:58,868;00:20:02,637;You gave me away like I was some dog
289;00:19:58,868;00:20:02,637;you didn't want anymore.
290;00:20:02,672;00:20:06,041;And now you curse me
290;00:20:02,672;00:20:06,041;because I've come home.
291;00:20:15,952;00:20:19,354;You'd have our father bow
291;00:20:15,952;00:20:19,354;down to your other family?
292;00:20:19,389;00:20:21,956;I have no other family.
293;00:20:21,991;00:20:24,025;Don't you?
294;00:20:25,260;00:20:27,562;Make your choice, Theon,
294;00:20:25,260;00:20:27,562;and do it quickly.
295;00:20:27,597;00:20:30,365;Our ships sail
295;00:20:27,597;00:20:30,365;with or without you.
296;00:20:42,511;00:20:44,178;You won't let me
296;00:20:42,511;00:20:44,178;leave this room.
297;00:20:44,213;00:20:47,215;You won't let me--
297;00:20:44,213;00:20:47,215;Shh, shh, keep your voice down.
298;00:20:49,885;00:20:53,321;Why? You think your father
298;00:20:49,885;00:20:53,321;can hear me?
299;00:20:53,355;00:20:55,990;He's 300 miles away!
300;00:20:56,024;00:20:57,992;( Sighs )
301;00:20:58,027;00:21:01,028;I don't intend for you
301;00:20:58,027;00:21:01,028;to stay here.
302;00:21:01,063;00:21:03,965;I might be able to bring you into
302;00:21:01,063;00:21:03,965;the castle kitchens.
303;00:21:03,999;00:21:07,668;Again, only temporary.
304;00:21:07,702;00:21:10,237;Every man who has
304;00:21:07,702;00:21:10,237;tasted my cooking
305;00:21:10,272;00:21:12,273;has told me what
305;00:21:10,272;00:21:12,273;a good whore I am.
306;00:21:12,307;00:21:14,275;But you wouldn't
306;00:21:12,307;00:21:14,275;be a cook.
307;00:21:14,309;00:21:18,012;You'd pose
307;00:21:14,309;00:21:18,012;as a scullion.
308;00:21:18,047;00:21:21,249;Scullion?
308;00:21:18,047;00:21:21,249;What is a scullion?
309;00:21:21,284;00:21:23,952;Kitchen wench.
310;00:21:23,986;00:21:26,655;A kitchen wench?
310;00:21:23,986;00:21:26,655;Yes, but--
311;00:21:26,689;00:21:28,183;Cleaning pots?
312;00:21:28,208;00:21:30,776;Is that how my lion
312;00:21:28,208;00:21:30,776;wants to see me?
313;00:21:30,860;00:21:33,595;Your lion wants
313;00:21:30,860;00:21:33,595;to see you alive.
314;00:21:33,629;00:21:36,064;We've come to
314;00:21:33,629;00:21:36,064;a dangerous place.
315;00:21:36,098;00:21:37,899;My sister wants to hurt me.
316;00:21:37,934;00:21:40,101;She'll look for any
316;00:21:37,934;00:21:40,101;weakness she can find.
317;00:21:40,135;00:21:42,003;She can't know about you.
318;00:21:42,037;00:21:44,138;I'm the weakness?
319;00:21:44,173;00:21:45,639;It's a compliment,
319;00:21:44,173;00:21:45,639;My Lady.
320;00:21:45,674;00:21:49,342;How is being a weakness
320;00:21:45,674;00:21:49,342;a compliment?
321;00:21:52,413;00:21:54,114;Language can be
321;00:21:52,413;00:21:54,114;a bit tricky here.
322;00:21:54,148;00:21:57,984;Oh, I'm too stupid
322;00:21:54,148;00:21:57,984;to understand.
323;00:21:58,018;00:22:00,386;The stupid foreign girl.
324;00:22:02,823;00:22:06,125;I am not
324;00:22:02,823;00:22:06,125;a kitchen wench.
325;00:22:30,849;00:22:33,351;When will Joffrey
325;00:22:30,849;00:22:33,351;and Sansa be married?
326;00:22:33,385;00:22:35,919;Soon, darling,
326;00:22:33,385;00:22:35,919;when the war is over.
327;00:22:35,954;00:22:38,855;Mother says I'll have
327;00:22:35,954;00:22:38,855;a new gown for the ceremony
328;00:22:38,890;00:22:41,325;and another for the feast.
329;00:22:41,359;00:22:44,428;But yours will be ivory
329;00:22:41,359;00:22:44,428;since you're the bride.
330;00:22:48,567;00:22:50,769;The Princess
330;00:22:48,567;00:22:50,769;just spoke to you.
331;00:22:50,803;00:22:52,872;Pardon, Your Grace.
332;00:22:55,242;00:22:57,543;I'm sure your dress will
332;00:22:55,242;00:22:57,543;be beautiful, Myrcella.
333;00:22:57,577;00:23:01,113;I'm counting the days
333;00:22:57,577;00:23:01,113;until the fighting is done
334;00:23:01,148;00:23:05,217;and I can pledge my love to
334;00:23:01,148;00:23:05,217;the King in sight of the Gods.
335;00:23:09,421;00:23:11,689;Is Joffrey going to kill
335;00:23:09,421;00:23:11,689;Sansa's brother?
336;00:23:14,226;00:23:16,293;He might.
337;00:23:17,929;00:23:20,363;Would you like that?
338;00:23:21,899;00:23:24,534;No.
338;00:23:21,899;00:23:24,534;I don't think so.
339;00:23:25,770;00:23:29,439;Even if he does,
339;00:23:25,770;00:23:29,439;Sansa will do her duty.

347;00:24:14,888;00:24:16,422;What are you doing?
348;00:24:16,456;00:24:18,324;Waiting for you
348;00:24:16,456;00:24:18,324;to tell me what to do.
349;00:24:18,359;00:24:20,593;I shouldn't have to tell
349;00:24:18,359;00:24:20,593;you to do things.
350;00:24:20,628;00:24:22,863;You should just do them.
351;00:24:22,897;00:24:25,065;What things?
352;00:24:25,099;00:24:27,167;Change my linens,

376;00:26:07,439;00:26:10,573;Two drops

383;00:26:29,095;00:26:31,062;new alliances.
384;00:26:32,465;00:26:36,202;And these alliances must often
384;00:26:32,465;00:26:36,202;be sealed in matrimony.
385;00:26:36,236;00:26:38,738;Matrimony, huh?
386;00:26:38,772;00:26:40,674;Yes.
387;00:26:40,708;00:26:42,909;I'm trusting the council
387;00:26:40,708;00:26:42,909;with these plans,
388;00:26:42,944;00:26:44,678;but the queen mustn't know.
389;00:26:44,712;00:26:47,280;We can't have her
389;00:26:44,712;00:26:47,280;meddling in affairs
390;00:26:47,315;00:26:48,660;that could determine
390;00:26:47,315;00:26:48,660;the future of the realm.
391;00:26:48,685;00:26:49,885;There's too much at stake.
392;00:26:50,051;00:26:53,019;Oh, yes, yes.
392;00:26:50,051;00:26:53,019;Indeed, yes.
393;00:26:53,054;00:26:56,322;I shall be silent
393;00:26:53,054;00:26:56,322;as the grave.
394;00:26:56,357;00:27:00,426;I'm brokering an alliance
394;00:26:56,357;00:27:00,426;with House Martell of Dorne.
395;00:27:00,461;00:27:02,929;Princess Myrcella will wed
395;00:27:00,461;00:27:02,929;their youngest son
396;00:27:02,963;00:27:05,899;when she comes of age,
396;00:27:02,963;00:27:05,899;ensuring their loyalty
397;00:27:05,934;00:27:08,603;and their army
397;00:27:05,934;00:27:08,603;should we need it.
398;00:27:08,637;00:27:12,608;Myrcella sent away
398;00:27:08,637;00:27:12,608;to Dorne?
399;00:27:14,311;00:27:17,681;But remember,
399;00:27:14,311;00:27:17,681;the queen mustn't know.
400;00:27:17,715;00:27:20,984;Ooh, the queen
400;00:27:17,715;00:27:20,984;mustn't know.
401;00:27:21,019;00:27:24,554;I love conversations
401;00:27:21,019;00:27:24,554;that begin this way.
402;00:27:24,589;00:27:27,824;I plan to marry
402;00:27:24,589;00:27:27,824;Princess Myrcella off
403;00:27:27,859;00:27:29,559;to Theon Greyjoy.
404;00:27:31,129;00:27:33,330;Theon Greyjoy?
405;00:27:33,364;00:27:36,099;Forgive me, My Lord,?
406;00:27:36,133;00:27:39,002;He grew up a ward
406;00:27:36,133;00:27:39,002;of Winterfell.
407;00:27:39,037;00:27:40,670;He fights
407;00:27:39,037;00:27:40,670;for Robb Stark.
408;00:27:40,704;00:27:44,240;Precisely. Theon's father
408;00:27:40,704;00:27:44,240;loathes the Starks
409;00:27:44,274;00:27:47,043;and will convince the boy
409;00:27:44,274;00:27:47,043;to come to our side.
410;00:27:47,111;00:27:50,546;Greyjoy can destroy
410;00:27:47,111;00:27:50,546;the northern army from within
411;00:27:50,581;00:27:53,115;and we can have
411;00:27:50,581;00:27:53,115;his father's ships.
412;00:27:53,150;00:27:56,652;But remember,
412;00:27:53,150;00:27:56,652;you must tell no one.
413;00:27:56,687;00:27:59,222;Tell no one what?
414;00:27:59,256;00:28:03,226;I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to
414;00:27:59,256;00:28:03,226;Robin Arryn of the Vale.
415;00:28:04,929;00:28:08,097;Lysa is not fond of me.
416;00:28:08,132;00:28:10,467;But perhaps the promise
416;00:28:08,132;00:28:10,467;of a royal match
417;00:28:10,501;00:28:13,736;will convince her
417;00:28:10,501;00:28:13,736;to let bygones be bygones.
418;00:28:13,770;00:28:15,705;She imprisoned you.
419;00:28:15,739;00:28:17,807;She tried
419;00:28:15,739;00:28:17,807;to execute you.
420;00:28:17,841;00:28:20,776;And you offer
420;00:28:17,841;00:28:20,776;her son a princess?
421;00:28:20,811;00:28:24,646;For men in our position,
421;00:28:20,811;00:28:24,646;holding grudges can be
422;00:28:24,681;00:28:26,448;an encumbrance,
422;00:28:24,681;00:28:26,448;don't you think?
423;00:28:26,483;00:28:30,853;And I suppose you want me
423;00:28:26,483;00:28:30,853;to broker this agreement?
424;00:28:30,887;00:28:32,521;Who better?
425;00:28:36,659;00:28:39,127;Yes, I could sing
425;00:28:36,659;00:28:39,127;this song to Lysa,
426;00:28:39,161;00:28:41,396;if I cared to.
427;00:28:41,430;00:28:43,632;What's in it
427;00:28:41,430;00:28:43,632;for me?
428;00:28:45,502;00:28:47,771;The gratitude of
428;00:28:45,502;00:28:47,771;the people of Westeros
429;00:28:47,805;00:28:49,506;for helping to end
429;00:28:47,805;00:28:49,506;this war,
430;00:28:49,541;00:28:53,711;the adoration of the King for
430;00:28:49,541;00:28:53,711;bringing the Vale back into the fold...
431;00:28:55,514;00:28:57,382;and Harrenhal.
432;00:28:57,416;00:28:59,817;Harrenhal is cursed.
433;00:28:59,852;00:29:01,753;Never took you
433;00:28:59,852;00:29:01,753;for a superstitious man.
434;00:29:01,787;00:29:03,687;By all means,
434;00:29:01,787;00:29:03,687;tear it down and rebuild.
435;00:29:03,722;00:29:05,489;You'll be able
435;00:29:03,722;00:29:05,489;to afford it.
436;00:29:05,523;00:29:08,325;I plan to make you
436;00:29:05,523;00:29:08,325;Lord of the Riverlands.
437;00:29:10,227;00:29:11,966;With a single stroke,
437;00:29:10,227;00:29:11,966;you'd make me one of the
438;00:29:11,991;00:29:13,029;greatest lords in the realm.
439;00:29:13,030;00:29:16,298;You served my family well
439;00:29:13,030;00:29:16,298;in the matter of the succession.
440;00:29:16,333;00:29:19,535;So did Janos Slynt, and he
440;00:29:16,333;00:29:19,535;was given Harrenhal, too.
441;00:29:19,569;00:29:22,471;Until you snatched it away.
442;00:29:22,506;00:29:24,807;I need you to
442;00:29:22,506;00:29:24,807;deliver Lysa Arryn.
443;00:29:24,841;00:29:27,577;I didn't need
443;00:29:24,841;00:29:27,577;Janos Slynt.
444;00:29:29,981;00:29:32,449;It's settled, then?
445;00:29:33,552;00:29:35,185;Good.
446;00:29:37,422;00:29:39,623;Oh, and remember--
447;00:29:39,658;00:29:41,492;the queen mustn't know.
448;00:29:53,272;00:29:56,140;( Breathing heavily )
449;00:30:20,367;00:30:22,034;That must hurt.
450;00:30:22,069;00:30:24,336;( Groans )
451;00:30:32,179;00:30:34,280;What?
452;00:30:35,916;00:30:37,349;What is it?
453;00:30:37,384;00:30:39,385;( Scoffs )
454;00:30:39,419;00:30:42,288;A member of the Kingsguard?
455;00:30:42,322;00:30:45,158;As if I wasn't humiliated
455;00:30:42,322;00:30:45,158;enough already.
456;00:30:45,192;00:30:47,427;( Sighs )
457;00:30:47,461;00:30:51,698;Brienne is a very
457;00:30:47,461;00:30:51,698;capable warrior.
458;00:30:52,900;00:30:55,268;And she's devoted to me.
459;00:30:56,938;00:30:59,506;You're jealous.
460;00:30:59,540;00:31:01,442;Jealous?
461;00:31:01,476;00:31:03,644;Of Brienne the beauty?
462;00:31:03,678;00:31:05,745;Don't make me laugh.
463;00:31:07,382;00:31:11,117;I'll make it up to you.
463;00:31:07,382;00:31:11,117;No, Your Grace.
464;00:31:12,253;00:31:14,454;Not tonight.
465;00:31:14,489;00:31:17,123;There's another Tyrell
465;00:31:14,489;00:31:17,123;who requires your attention.
466;00:31:17,158;00:31:18,858;You didn't win
466;00:31:17,158;00:31:18,858;my father's support
467;00:31:18,893;00:31:21,027;or his army
467;00:31:18,893;00:31:21,027;on charm alone.
468;00:31:34,675;00:31:38,444;Your vassals are starting
468;00:31:34,675;00:31:38,444;to snigger behind your back.
469;00:31:38,478;00:31:41,447;Brides aren't usually virgins
469;00:31:38,478;00:31:41,447;two weeks after their wedding night.
470;00:31:41,482;00:31:43,350;And Margaery's a virgin?
471;00:31:43,384;00:31:45,586;Officially.
472;00:31:46,921;00:31:48,956;Shall I bring her
472;00:31:46,921;00:31:48,956;to you?
473;00:32:15,755;00:32:17,656;I should warn you,
474;00:32:17,690;00:32:19,624;I've had quite
474;00:32:17,690;00:32:19,624;a bit of wine.
475;00:32:19,659;00:32:22,194;As is your right.
475;00:32:19,659;00:32:22,194;You are a King.
476;00:32:24,098;00:32:26,266;You look
476;00:32:24,098;00:32:26,266;very beautiful.
477;00:32:26,300;00:32:28,167;Thank you,
477;00:32:26,300;00:32:28,167;Your Grace.
478;00:32:28,202;00:32:32,139;It's a lovely gown.
478;00:32:28,202;00:32:32,139;You think so?
479;00:32:32,173;00:32:34,909;I can't decide
479;00:32:32,173;00:32:34,909;how I like it better.
480;00:32:34,944;00:32:37,045;This way...
481;00:32:37,079;00:32:40,082;or this way.
482;00:32:46,223;00:32:47,856;You certainly don't need it.
483;00:32:49,492;00:32:50,960;Although...
484;00:32:50,994;00:32:54,597;some say that
484;00:32:50,994;00:32:54,597;beauty most desired
485;00:32:54,631;00:32:56,399;is the beauty concealed.
486;00:33:12,851;00:33:15,086;Must be the wine.
487;00:33:15,120;00:33:17,688;Here, let me.
488;00:33:33,104;00:33:35,672;( Shudders )
489;00:33:37,675;00:33:39,643;I'm sorry.
490;00:33:39,677;00:33:41,845;Do you want my brother
490;00:33:39,677;00:33:41,845;to come in and help?
491;00:33:44,849;00:33:47,251;What?
491;00:33:44,849;00:33:47,251;He could get you started.
492;00:33:47,285;00:33:48,617;I know he wouldn't mind.
493;00:33:48,642;00:33:51,221;Or I can turn over and you
493;00:33:48,642;00:33:51,221;can pretend I'm him.
494;00:33:53,325;00:33:56,027;I don't know what
494;00:33:53,325;00:33:56,027;you're talking about.
495;00:34:01,201;00:34:04,003;There's no need
495;00:34:01,201;00:34:04,003;for us to play games.
496;00:34:04,038;00:34:07,240;Save your lies for court.
496;00:34:04,038;00:34:07,240;You're going to need a lot of them.
497;00:34:25,860;00:34:28,761;Your enemies
497;00:34:25,860;00:34:28,761;aren't happy about us.
498;00:34:28,796;00:34:31,130;They want to tear
498;00:34:28,796;00:34:31,130;us apart.
499;00:34:31,165;00:34:34,233;And the best way
499;00:34:31,165;00:34:34,233;to stop them
500;00:34:34,267;00:34:37,570;is to put your baby
501;00:34:37,604;00:34:40,072;in my belly.
502;00:34:42,975;00:34:45,478;We can try again later.
503;00:34:45,512;00:34:47,380;You decide how

504;00:34:47,414;00:34:49,282;with me,
504;00:34:47,414;00:34:49,282;with me and Loras.
505;00:34:49,316;00:34:51,785;However else you like.
506;00:34:54,156;00:34:56,857;Whatever you need to do.
507;00:34:58,860;00:35:02,163;You are a King.
508;00:35:10,473;00:35:12,740;Cersei:
508;00:35:10,473;00:35:12,740;You monster.
509;00:35:12,774;00:35:15,109;Myrcella is my only daughter.
510;00:35:15,144;00:35:17,812;Do you really think I'll let you
510;00:35:15,144;00:35:17,812;sell her like a common whore?
511;00:35:17,846;00:35:19,380;Myrcella's a Princess.
512;00:35:19,414;00:35:21,048;Some would say
512;00:35:19,414;00:35:21,048;she was born for this.
513;00:35:21,083;00:35:22,750;I will not let you
513;00:35:21,083;00:35:22,750;ship her off to Dorne
514;00:35:22,818;00:35:24,919;as I was shipped off
514;00:35:22,818;00:35:24,919;to Robert Baratheon.
