2;00:03:55,433;00:03:56,726;Boy.
3;00:03:57,810;00:03:59,229;Lovely boy.
4;00:03:59,938;00:04:01,147;What do you want?
5;00:04:01,689;00:04:03,316;A man has a thirst.
6;00:04:03,441;00:04:05,860;The man does not drink
6;00:04:03,441;00:04:05,860;for a day and a night.
7;00:04:06,069;00:04:08,279;A boy could make a friend.
8;00:04:08,571;00:04:09,864;I have friends.
9;00:04:09,989;00:04:13,535;Give us a beer. Before I skin you.
10;00:04:14,077;00:04:16,079;A man does not choose his companions.
11;00:04:16,204;00:04:18,122;These two, they have no courtesy.
12;00:04:18,456;00:04:20,166;A man must ask forgiveness.
13;00:04:23,086;00:04:25,338;You're called Arry.
14;00:04:28,049;00:04:30,885;This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar.
15;00:04:31,094;00:04:32,554;Once of the Free City of Lorath.
16;00:04:32,679;00:04:34,556;Hey, you little shit.
17;00:04:34,681;00:04:36,599;Get us beer!
18;00:04:36,724;00:04:38,351;You should have asked nicely.
19;00:04:43,648;00:04:45,441;Come closer.
20;00:04:45,567;00:04:49,612;And I'll shove that stick up your
20;00:04:45,567;00:04:49,612;bunghole and fuck you bloody.
21;00:04:49,737;00:04:51,948;The boy has more courage than sense.
22;00:04:52,073;00:04:53,366;Come here!
23;00:04:53,491;00:04:55,994;Yoren said none of us were
23;00:04:53,491;00:04:55,994;should go near of those three.
24;00:04:56,286;00:04:57,620;They don't scare me.
25;00:04:58,162;00:04:59,497;Then you're stupid.
26;00:04:59,622;00:05:01,416;They scare me.
27;00:05:05,837;00:05:08,590;Would a gold collector look
27;00:05:05,837;00:05:08,590;this far from King's Landing?
28;00:05:13,887;00:05:15,013;What are you doing?
29;00:05:15,054;00:05:16,139;They're looking for me.
30;00:05:17,015;00:05:18,516;You're in command here?
31;00:05:20,018;00:05:21,853;You're a long way from home.
32;00:05:22,478;00:05:23,813;I asked you a question.
33;00:05:24,439;00:05:25,648;Aye, you did.
34;00:05:27,233;00:05:29,027;You asked without manners.
35;00:05:29,611;00:05:31,404;And I chose not to answer.
36;00:05:32,113;00:05:33,990;I have a royal warrant.
37;00:05:35,241;00:05:37,952;For one of these gutter
37;00:05:35,241;00:05:37,952;rats you're transporting.
38;00:05:41,122;00:05:43,208;Well the thing is,
39;00:05:43,958;00:05:47,253;these gutter rats belong
39;00:05:43,958;00:05:47,253;to the Night's Watch now.
40;00:05:47,670;00:05:50,548;That puts them beyond the
40;00:05:47,670;00:05:50,548;reach of kings and queens.
41;00:05:53,134;00:05:54,677;It's a funny thing.
42;00:05:54,802;00:05:56,971;People worry so much about their throats,
43;00:05:57,013;00:05:59,182;they forget about what's down low.
44;00:06:00,433;00:06:03,561;Now I sharpened this
44;00:06:00,433;00:06:03,561;blade before breakfast.
45;00:06:04,437;00:06:07,690;I could shave a spider's
45;00:06:04,437;00:06:07,690;arse if I wanted to.
46;00:06:08,650;00:06:09,609;Or,
47;00:06:09,859;00:06:12,237;I could nick this artery in your leg
48;00:06:12,362;00:06:17,075;and once it's nicked, there's no one
48;00:06:12,362;00:06:17,075;around here who knows how to un-nick it.
49;00:06:19,035;00:06:20,912;We'll just keep that.
50;00:06:22,956;00:06:25,291;Good steel is always needed on the wall.
51;00:06:26,167;00:06:28,002;Seems you have a choice.
52;00:06:28,711;00:06:32,298;You can die here at this
52;00:06:28,711;00:06:32,298;crossroads a long way from home.
53;00:06:32,632;00:06:35,176;Or you can go back to your
53;00:06:32,632;00:06:35,176;city and tell your masters
54;00:06:35,218;00:06:37,637;you didn't find what you were looking for.
55;00:06:44,185;00:06:46,187;We're looking for a boy named Gendry.
56;00:06:46,771;00:06:48,815;He carries a bull's head helmet.
57;00:06:49,816;00:06:53,528;Anyone turning him over will
57;00:06:49,816;00:06:53,528;earn the King's reward.
58;00:06:54,153;00:06:56,823;We'll be back. With more men.
59;00:06:56,948;00:07:00,034;And I'll be taking your head home
59;00:06:56,948;00:07:00,034;along with that bastard boy.
60;00:07:14,924;00:07:17,177;[Tyrion whistling]
61;00:07:31,107;00:07:32,275;[woman laughing]
62;00:07:36,154;00:07:37,447;My lord.
63;00:07:37,447;00:07:38,907;You make me wait a long time.
64;00:07:38,948;00:07:40,950;And your friend keeps me company.
65;00:07:41,784;00:07:43,703;We were just speaking of your bravery
66;00:07:43,828;00:07:46,748;in the victory against the
66;00:07:43,828;00:07:46,748;Stark auxiliary forces.
67;00:07:47,999;00:07:49,501;It was quite a battle.
68;00:07:50,627;00:07:53,880;I heard you suffered a terrible head wound.
69;00:07:54,172;00:07:57,217;The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
70;00:07:57,717;00:08:00,220;And I tell him the story of how we meet.
71;00:08:01,137;00:08:05,099;To find such a lovely creature
71;00:08:01,137;00:08:05,099;working in your father's kitchen.
72;00:08:05,558;00:08:07,519;It almost beggars belief.
73;00:08:08,353;00:08:09,771;Strange things do happen.
74;00:08:10,730;00:08:12,649;You should taste her fish pie.
75;00:08:13,149;00:08:15,527;I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.
76;00:08:15,652;00:08:17,070;How can you tell?
77;00:08:17,278;00:08:18,613;I can always tell.
78;00:08:19,113;00:08:22,450;Men like Lord Varys and I can't let
78;00:08:19,113;00:08:22,450;our disadvantages get the best of us.
79;00:08:23,034;00:08:24,661;We'll make a fisherman of him yet.
80;00:08:25,703;00:08:30,083;I am glad your new friend was able
80;00:08:25,703;00:08:30,083;to accompany you to the capital.
81;00:08:30,917;00:08:33,920;Friends are such an important part of life.
82;00:08:35,088;00:08:37,882;Unfortunate that your father
82;00:08:35,088;00:08:37,882;didn't want her to come.
83;00:08:38,174;00:08:40,009;But rest easy my lord,
84;00:08:40,885;00:08:44,556;I am very good at keeping
84;00:08:40,885;00:08:44,556;secrets for my good friends.
85;00:08:45,390;00:08:47,308;Your discretion is legendary,
86;00:08:47,767;00:08:48,768;where your friends are concerned.
87;00:08:49,143;00:08:53,940;How unspeakable of me to go on and
87;00:08:49,143;00:08:53,940;on, when all you want to do is rest.
88;00:08:54,065;00:08:54,858;I will leave you.
89;00:08:57,360;00:08:59,821;Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear.
90;00:08:59,946;00:09:02,782;The city is made brighter by your presence.
91;00:09:02,907;00:09:04,951;We have a council meeting, my lord.
92;00:09:08,872;00:09:10,164;I don't like threats.
93;00:09:11,082;00:09:12,417;Who threatened you?
94;00:09:12,542;00:09:15,461;I'm not Ned Stark.
94;00:09:12,542;00:09:15,461;I understand the way this game is played.
95;00:09:15,587;00:09:18,381;Ned Stark was a man of honor. And I am not.
96;00:09:18,506;00:09:21,593;Threaten me again and I will
96;00:09:18,506;00:09:21,593;have you thrown into the sea.
97;00:09:25,054;00:09:27,640;You might be disappointed in the results.
98;00:09:28,349;00:09:30,476;The storms come and go.
99;00:09:30,894;00:09:32,770;The big fish eat the little fish.
100;00:09:32,896;00:09:35,440;And I keep on paddling.
101;00:09:36,983;00:09:38,526;Come, my lord.
102;00:09:38,651;00:09:41,571;We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.
103;00:09:46,784;00:09:50,496;From this time until the end of time,
103;00:09:46,784;00:09:50,496;we are not part of your realm,
104;00:09:50,622;00:09:54,000;but a free and independent
104;00:09:50,622;00:09:54,000;Kingdom of the North.
105;00:09:58,213;00:10:00,673;He has more spirit than his
105;00:09:58,213;00:10:00,673;father, I'll give him that.
106;00:10:00,798;00:10:03,635;You've perfected the art
106;00:10:00,798;00:10:03,635;of tearing up papers.
107;00:10:04,010;00:10:07,972;Give him his father's bones back, at
107;00:10:04,010;00:10:07,972;least as a gesture of good faith.
108;00:10:08,431;00:10:10,475;You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?
109;00:10:11,309;00:10:13,186;I will, Your Grace.
110;00:10:14,354;00:10:16,856;Did you see my brother when
110;00:10:14,354;00:10:16,856;you were the Starks guest?
111;00:10:16,981;00:10:18,066;I did.
112;00:10:18,525;00:10:20,485;They have not broken his
112;00:10:18,525;00:10:20,485;spirit, Your Grace.
113;00:10:21,778;00:10:23,613;If you speak with him,
114;00:10:25,198;00:10:26,824;tell him he's not been forgotten.
115;00:10:27,659;00:10:28,910;I will, Your Grace.
116;00:10:29,035;00:10:30,161;Safe travels, cousin.
117;00:10:34,791;00:10:36,960;You have a deft hand with diplomacy.
118;00:10:37,085;00:10:38,086;If that's everything?
119;00:10:38,211;00:10:43,091;A raven flew in this
119;00:10:38,211;00:10:43,091;morning from Castle Black.
120;00:10:43,383;00:10:45,510;Trouble with the wildlings?
121;00:10:45,635;00:10:48,096;That's why they're called wildlings.
122;00:10:48,221;00:10:50,265;Somewhat less wild these days.
123;00:10:50,807;00:10:54,310;It seems they've stopped killing each
123;00:10:50,807;00:10:54,310;other and started following this
124;00:10:54,435;00:10:55,728;King-Beyond-the-Wall.
125;00:10:55,854;00:10:59,899;Another king? How many is that now?
125;00:10:55,854;00:10:59,899;Five? I've lost count.
126;00:11:00,400;00:11:03,945;Lord Commander asks that we
126;00:11:00,400;00:11:03,945;send more men to man The Wall.
127;00:11:04,070;00:11:07,407;Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war.
127;00:11:04,070;00:11:07,407;We have no men to spare.
128;00:11:07,532;00:11:12,078;Cold winds are rising, and
128;00:11:07,532;00:11:12,078;the dead rise with them.
129;00:11:12,203;00:11:15,665;The northerners are a superstitious people.
130;00:11:16,082;00:11:19,752;According to the Commander, one of these
130;00:11:16,082;00:11:19,752;dead men attacked him in his chambers.
131;00:11:20,128;00:11:21,963;Mormont doesn't lie.
132;00:11:22,672;00:11:24,841;How do you kill a dead man?
133;00:11:25,633;00:11:27,468;Apparently you burn him.
134;00:11:28,845;00:11:30,889;One trip to The Wall and you come back
135;00:11:31,014;00:11:34,976;believing in grumpkins and snarks.
136;00:11:35,101;00:11:36,978;I don't know what I believe,
137;00:11:37,103;00:11:39,355;but here's a fact for you.
138;00:11:39,981;00:11:42,567;The Night's Watch is the
138;00:11:39,981;00:11:42,567;only thing that separates us
139;00:11:42,692;00:11:44,110;from what lies beyond the Wall.
140;00:11:44,235;00:11:49,073;I have every confidence the brave men of
140;00:11:44,235;00:11:49,073;the Night's Watch will protect us all.
141;00:11:50,700;00:11:52,410;Night, sir.
142;00:11:52,535;00:11:54,704;The gods wanted us to have dignity,
143;00:11:54,829;00:11:56,706;wouldn't make us fart when we died.
144;00:11:58,750;00:12:00,251;We fart when we die?
145;00:12:01,127;00:12:05,298;My blessed mother was holding her
145;00:12:01,127;00:12:05,298;own when she left this world.
146;00:12:05,673;00:12:08,218;She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.
147;00:12:09,093;00:12:12,388;[farting noises]
148;00:12:18,186;00:12:21,523;Seems a bit greedy for one
148;00:12:18,186;00:12:21,523;man to have so many wives.
149;00:12:21,648;00:12:24,150;We were having a serious discussion.
150;00:12:24,567;00:12:26,402;Wouldn't two or three be enough for him?
151;00:12:28,363;00:12:30,365;Would you look at that.
152;00:12:31,824;00:12:34,494;Nothing like the sight
152;00:12:31,824;00:12:34,494;of a woman walking away.
153;00:12:34,619;00:12:37,080;I prefer watching them come towards me.
154;00:12:37,664;00:12:39,499;I'm sure that's nice too.
155;00:12:39,624;00:12:41,417;Well, there was a milkmaid
156;00:12:41,626;00:12:44,337;named Violet on the next farm
156;00:12:41,626;00:12:44,337;over from where I grew up.
157;00:12:45,171;00:12:48,466;And we were wrestling together from
157;00:12:45,171;00:12:48,466;the time we were six years old.
158;00:12:48,842;00:12:50,385;And then we got older,
159;00:12:50,927;00:12:55,723;the wrestling, uh …changed.
160;00:12:56,057;00:12:58,184;You were with her?
161;00:12:58,726;00:13:00,311;How many times?
162;00:13:00,812;00:13:02,564;Well, as many times as I could.
163;00:13:05,942;00:13:08,278;Wish I'd grew up on a farm.
164;00:13:08,403;00:13:10,196;We need more potatoes.
165;00:13:10,321;00:13:12,407;I'll get another sack for the sludge.
166;00:13:15,869;00:13:17,620;Get the turnips too.
167;00:13:29,632;00:13:32,635;No, Ghost, no!
168;00:13:32,760;00:13:34,596;No.
169;00:13:35,513;00:13:38,641;Ghost, away. Shoo.
169;00:13:35,513;00:13:38,641;Shoo!
170;00:13:41,936;00:13:43,897;You all right?
171;00:13:44,606;00:13:47,400;Did he frighten you?
171;00:13:44,606;00:13:47,400;You shouldn't touch me.
172;00:13:47,525;00:13:50,737;Oh, oh. Right.
173;00:13:51,654;00:13:54,616;I'm sorry. I just wanted to
173;00:13:51,654;00:13:54,616;make sure you weren't hurt.
174;00:14:01,831;00:14:02,957;You're very brave.
175;00:14:13,134;00:14:14,719;What's he doing?
176;00:14:15,762;00:14:17,013;This is Gilly,
177;00:14:17,138;00:14:20,141;she's one of Craster's daughters.
178;00:14:20,600;00:14:22,352;Hello, Gilly. What's he doing?
179;00:14:22,477;00:14:23,686;Sam said you could help.
180;00:14:24,062;00:14:25,647;I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed...
181;00:14:25,772;00:14:26,856;She's pregnant.
182;00:14:34,113;00:14:36,783;We have to take her with us, when we leave.
183;00:14:36,908;00:14:37,909;What?
184;00:14:38,743;00:14:40,537;I know it sounds a bit mad.
185;00:14:40,662;00:14:42,455;No it doesn't sound a bit
185;00:14:40,662;00:14:42,455;mad, it's impossible.
186;00:14:42,580;00:14:44,499;The Lord Commander...
186;00:14:42,580;00:14:44,499;We are sworn to protect.
187;00:14:44,624;00:14:47,043;Sam we can't take her.
187;00:14:44,624;00:14:47,043;Please sir, please.
188;00:14:47,168;00:14:48,878;I can still run if I have to.
189;00:14:49,003;00:14:50,171;It's just not possible.
190;00:14:50,296;00:14:52,841;I'm going to have a baby,
190;00:14:50,296;00:14:52,841;if it's a boy I...
191;00:14:53,716;00:14:55,385;If it's a boy, what?
192;00:15:01,182;00:15:04,978;You want us to risk our lives for you,
192;00:15:01,182;00:15:04,978;and you won't even tell us why.
193;00:15:11,025;00:15:12,402;Why did you do that?
194;00:15:12,527;00:15:14,112;Do what, ask her a question?
195;00:15:14,237;00:15:15,697;You were cruel.
195;00:15:14,237;00:15:15,697;Cruel!?
196;00:15:16,114;00:15:18,408;Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
197;00:15:18,533;00:15:20,451;I didn't touch her!
197;00:15:18,533;00:15:20,451;No you just want to steal her,
198;00:15:20,577;00:15:22,078;what do you think Craster
198;00:15:20,577;00:15:22,078;cuts off for that?
199;00:15:22,203;00:15:23,705;I can't steal her,
200;00:15:24,080;00:15:26,624;she's a person not a goat.
201;00:15:31,421;00:15:34,299;We're heading deeper and deeper
201;00:15:31,421;00:15:34,299;into wildling territory.
202;00:15:34,716;00:15:36,426;We can't take a girl with us.
203;00:15:36,551;00:15:38,761;Mormont wouldn't have it.
203;00:15:36,551;00:15:38,761;And even if he would,
204;00:15:39,095;00:15:40,430;what would we do with her?
205;00:15:40,555;00:15:42,473;Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?
206;00:15:43,725;00:15:45,059;I could try...
207;00:15:45,560;00:15:47,729;What? I've read about it.
208;00:15:49,189;00:15:50,773;A bit.
209;00:15:52,609;00:15:53,902;I'm sorry Sam,
210;00:15:55,028;00:15:56,529;we can't help her.
211;00:16:53,044;00:16:54,712;Khaleesi.
212;00:17:40,383;00:17:43,219;You don't need to see this.
212;00:17:40,383;00:17:43,219;He is blood of my blood.
213;00:17:45,847;00:17:47,515;Who did this?
214;00:17:47,807;00:17:49,434;Khal Pono perhaps,
215;00:17:49,559;00:17:51,519;Khal Jhaqo...
216;00:17:51,644;00:17:54,606;They don't like the idea of a
216;00:17:51,644;00:17:54,606;woman leading a Khalasaar.
217;00:17:54,731;00:17:57,692;They will like it far less
217;00:17:54,731;00:17:57,692;when I'm done with them.
218;00:19:30,326;00:19:32,453;Is it as you remember my lord?
219;00:19:32,579;00:19:34,414;Looks smaller.
220;00:19:34,539;00:19:36,541;Everything looks bigger
220;00:19:34,539;00:19:36,541;when you're a child.
221;00:19:36,666;00:19:40,003;I remember my father's cabin, felt
221;00:19:36,666;00:19:40,003;like a palace when I was little.
222;00:19:40,503;00:19:42,172;Now look at it...
223;00:19:43,506;00:19:45,592;They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
224;00:19:45,717;00:19:47,343;Who will?
225;00:19:47,677;00:19:49,304;Anyone who matters,
226;00:19:49,429;00:19:51,014;this is a big day for them.
227;00:19:51,139;00:19:54,350;They haven't had much to get
227;00:19:51,139;00:19:54,350;excited about since I left.
228;00:19:55,018;00:19:57,353;It's a hard place the Iron Islands...
229;00:19:57,478;00:19:59,105;always has been.
230;00:19:59,230;00:20:01,274;It's cold and it's wet.
231;00:20:01,691;00:20:02,901;I love the cold and wet.
232;00:20:03,026;00:20:05,820;They say hard places breed hard men,
233;00:20:06,112;00:20:09,574;and hard men rule the world.
234;00:20:11,743;00:20:14,537;Then you'll be king before long.
235;00:20:16,539;00:20:18,875;Try smiling with your lips closed.
236;00:20:19,459;00:20:21,836;Hmm, better.
237;00:20:24,672;00:20:27,425;My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.
238;00:20:27,550;00:20:29,177;I don't blame him.
239;00:20:29,302;00:20:32,472;He says that you're all reavers and rapers.
240;00:20:32,597;00:20:34,557;And that no matter how many women you have,
241;00:20:34,682;00:20:36,351;you'll never be satis...
242;00:20:36,476;00:20:39,270;Quit talking about your father.
243;00:20:39,395;00:20:41,689;He's right about us.
244;00:20:41,814;00:20:45,109;Our wives from the Iron Islands,
245;00:20:45,485;00:20:49,030;they're for breeding.
245;00:20:45,485;00:20:49,030;That's not enough for us.
246;00:20:49,155;00:20:53,284;That's why we take saltwives
246;00:20:49,155;00:20:53,284;from the women we capture.
247;00:20:53,409;00:20:56,579;Capture me!
247;00:20:53,409;00:20:56,579;Take me with you when you go ashore.
248;00:20:56,704;00:21:00,792;Make me your saltwife.
248;00:20:56,704;00:21:00,792;Your place is on this ship.
249;00:21:00,917;00:21:02,794;Not after you leave.
250;00:21:02,919;00:21:07,090;Father will punish me.
250;00:21:02,919;00:21:07,090;He'll call me a whore.
251;00:21:08,049;00:21:09,592;I haven't paid you.
252;00:21:49,424;00:21:50,758;I barely touched her.
253;00:21:51,050;00:21:53,469;And you charge twice as much
253;00:21:51,050;00:21:53,469;as every other brothel.
254;00:21:53,595;00:21:56,472;And this is what I get, crying.
254;00:21:53,595;00:21:56,472;One moment, my friend.
255;00:21:56,598;00:21:57,557;A moment.
256;00:22:06,774;00:22:09,194;Please accept my sincerest apologies.
257;00:22:09,319;00:22:10,945;Ramka will take good care of you.
258;00:22:40,975;00:22:44,521;Sorry my lord.
258;00:22:40,975;00:22:44,521;Shhh.
259;00:22:46,981;00:22:48,233;Did he hurt you?
260;00:22:50,485;00:22:51,861;Not, my lord.
261;00:22:54,364;00:22:56,574;It's Megan.
261;00:22:54,364;00:22:56,574;Who?
262;00:22:59,118;00:23:00,453;She works for you.
263;00:23:01,496;00:23:07,168;She's the one, the girl whose,
263;00:23:01,496;00:23:07,168;they killed her baby.
264;00:23:07,293;00:23:12,382;Ah, yes, that was
264;00:23:07,293;00:23:12,382;poorly handled.
265;00:23:14,759;00:23:18,137;Sometimes those with the
265;00:23:14,759;00:23:18,137;most power have the least grace.
266;00:23:19,722;00:23:22,183;Can't stop thinking about it,
267;00:23:22,976;00:23:24,686;I can't sleep.
268;00:23:26,604;00:23:28,523;Her poor little baby.
269;00:23:29,899;00:23:32,026;You know you remind
269;00:23:29,899;00:23:32,026;me of another girl?
270;00:23:33,236;00:23:36,322;A lovely thing I once acquired
270;00:23:33,236;00:23:36,322;from an Elysium pleasure house.
271;00:23:37,866;00:23:40,743;Beautiful, like yourself,
272;00:23:40,869;00:23:44,581;and intelligent as yourself.
273;00:23:45,248;00:23:46,749;But she wasn't happy.
274;00:23:48,501;00:23:53,464;She cried, often.
274;00:23:48,501;00:23:53,464;I asked her why but,
275;00:23:55,466;00:23:58,386;we didn't have the kind of
275;00:23:55,466;00:23:58,386;rapport that you and I have.
276;00:24:02,140;00:24:03,850;Yes, it was quite sad.
277;00:24:06,394;00:24:09,147;Girls from Elysium pleasure
277;00:24:06,394;00:24:09,147;houses are expensive.
278;00:24:09,731;00:24:11,316;Extremely expensive.
279;00:24:11,983;00:24:14,694;And this one wasn't making me any money.
280;00:24:19,157;00:24:21,409;I hate bad investments.
281;00:24:22,452;00:24:24,704;Really, I do.
282;00:24:24,829;00:24:26,915;They haunt me.
283;00:24:31,127;00:24:33,338;I had no idea how to make her happy,
284;00:24:34,547;00:24:36,925;no idea how to mitigate my losses.
285;00:24:39,135;00:24:42,889;A very wealthy patron, he offered me
285;00:24:39,135;00:24:42,889;a tremendous amount of money
286;00:24:43,014;00:24:48,269;to let him transform
286;00:24:43,014;00:24:48,269;this lovely, sad girl.
287;00:24:48,603;00:24:53,942;To use her in ways that
287;00:24:48,603;00:24:53,942;never occur to most men.
288;00:24:55,735;00:24:58,112;And you know what occurs to most men.
289;00:25:02,367;00:25:05,453;I wouldn't say he succeeded
289;00:25:02,367;00:25:05,453;in making her happy
290;00:25:07,205;00:25:11,042;but my losses were definitely mitigated.
291;00:25:19,300;00:25:21,594;Take tonight off.
291;00:25:19,300;00:25:21,594;Tomorrow, Megan's child
292;00:25:23,263;00:25:24,639;will see you tomorrow.
293;00:25:25,223;00:25:26,933;Better be happy.
294;00:25:31,145;00:25:32,647;That makes me happy.
295;00:25:45,493;00:25:46,786;More wine?
296;00:25:47,579;00:25:50,206;Damn it, boy!
296;00:25:47,579;00:25:50,206;Apologies, my lord.
297;00:25:50,331;00:25:51,374;Leave us, Podrik.
298;00:25:51,416;00:25:53,209;I believe we know
298;00:25:51,416;00:25:53,209;how to pour our own wine.
299;00:25:54,836;00:25:58,173;Is that your new squire?
299;00:25:54,836;00:25:58,173;Could have found you a proper lad.
300;00:25:58,298;00:26:01,176;Myself, I prefer the improper ones.
301;00:26:01,426;00:26:03,094;Hmm, that's a good red.
302;00:26:03,219;00:26:05,889;Dornish?
302;00:26:03,219;00:26:05,889;You know your wines, my lord.
303;00:26:06,014;00:26:06,723;That I do.
304;00:26:08,558;00:26:10,059;A fine dinner, my lord.
305;00:26:10,185;00:26:11,519;Call me Tyrion, please.
306;00:26:11,895;00:26:15,190;I'm sure you're getting used to
306;00:26:11,895;00:26:15,190;fine dinners, now that you're a lord.
307;00:26:15,690;00:26:17,400;Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.
308;00:26:17,650;00:26:20,361;Wars have been started for less.
309;00:26:21,613;00:26:22,864;I heard there was some trouble
310;00:26:22,989;00:26:24,657;in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
311;00:26:24,991;00:26:27,702;Hmm. Nasty business,
311;00:26:24,991;00:26:27,702;had to be done.
312;00:26:27,827;00:26:28,745;Yes, of course.
313;00:26:29,037;00:26:30,455;City Watch must keep the peace.
314;00:26:30,580;00:26:35,168;Only, I hadn't realized peace
314;00:26:30,580;00:26:35,168;depended on killing babies.
315;00:26:36,085;00:26:38,505;Orders are orders.
315;00:26:36,085;00:26:38,505;Quite right.
316;00:26:38,630;00:26:40,507;Especially the queen's orders.
317;00:26:40,590;00:26:42,383;I never said they were the queen's orders.
318;00:26:42,467;00:26:46,471;No, but who else would want
318;00:26:42,467;00:26:46,471;to murder King Robert's bastards?
319;00:26:47,180;00:26:50,433;She's always been a jealous woman.
319;00:26:47,180;00:26:50,433;You know your sister better than I do.
320;00:26:50,558;00:26:52,852;You've heard the awful rumors
320;00:26:50,558;00:26:52,852;about my brother and sister.
321;00:26:52,977;00:26:54,020;I don't listen to filth.
322;00:26:54,145;00:26:57,482;That's good of you,
322;00:26:54,145;00:26:57,482;but you have heard them.
323;00:26:57,899;00:26:59,859;I suppose people
323;00:26:57,899;00:26:59,859;who do believe that filth,
324;00:26:59,984;00:27:01,778;consider Robert's bastards
324;00:26:59,984;00:27:01,778;to be better claimants
325;00:27:01,903;00:27:03,488;to the throne than
325;00:27:01,903;00:27:03,488;Cersei's children.
326;00:27:03,613;00:27:05,698;Joffrey is my king,
326;00:27:03,613;00:27:05,698;the rest doesn't interest me.
327;00:27:05,823;00:27:07,325;I appreciate your loyalty.
328;00:27:08,952;00:27:09,953;Tell me.
329;00:27:10,745;00:27:14,040;When your men slaughtered
329;00:27:10,745;00:27:14,040;Ned Stark's men in the throne room,
330;00:27:14,165;00:27:16,209;did you give the order?
331;00:27:17,627;00:27:18,294;I did.
332;00:27:18,419;00:27:20,255;And I would again.
333;00:27:21,089;00:27:24,759;The man was a traitor.
333;00:27:21,089;00:27:24,759;He tried to buy my loyalty.
334;00:27:24,884;00:27:25,885;The fool.
335;00:27:26,928;00:27:28,930;He had no idea you
335;00:27:26,928;00:27:28,930;were already bought.
336;00:27:29,639;00:27:30,765;Are you drunk?
337;00:27:31,391;00:27:33,768;I'll not have my honor
337;00:27:31,391;00:27:33,768;questioned by an Imp.
338;00:27:33,893;00:27:37,146;I'm not questioning
338;00:27:33,893;00:27:37,146;your honor, Lord Janos.
339;00:27:37,605;00:27:39,691;I'm denying its existence.
340;00:27:39,816;00:27:42,569;You think I'll stand here and
340;00:27:39,816;00:27:42,569;take this from you, dwarf.
341;00:27:42,694;00:27:43,528;Dwarf?
342;00:27:43,987;00:27:45,363;You should have stopped at imp.
343;00:27:45,780;00:27:48,157;And yes, you will stand
343;00:27:45,780;00:27:48,157;here and take it from me,
344;00:27:48,283;00:27:50,451;unless you'd like to take
344;00:27:48,283;00:27:50,451;it from my friend here.
345;00:27:51,828;00:27:54,789;I intend to serve as Hand of the King
345;00:27:51,828;00:27:54,789;until my father returns from the war
346;00:27:55,039;00:27:57,292;and seeing as you betrayed
346;00:27:55,039;00:27:57,292;the last Hand of the King,
347;00:27:57,417;00:28:00,336;well I just wouldn't feel
347;00:27:57,417;00:28:00,336;safe with you lurking about.
348;00:28:00,461;00:28:01,629;What are you…
349;00:28:01,921;00:28:03,798;My friends at court will not allow this.
350;00:28:03,923;00:28:04,757;The queen herself...
351;00:28:04,883;00:28:06,217;The queen regent.
352;00:28:06,342;00:28:08,469;And you're a fool to
352;00:28:06,342;00:28:08,469;believe she's your friend.
353;00:28:09,137;00:28:10,763;We shall hear what Joffrey
353;00:28:09,137;00:28:10,763;has to say about this.
354;00:28:10,889;00:28:11,973;No, we shan't.
355;00:28:19,480;00:28:22,859;There's a ship leaving for
355;00:28:19,480;00:28:22,859;East Watch by the Sea tonight.
356;00:28:23,234;00:28:26,404;From there, I'm afraid it's rather
356;00:28:23,234;00:28:26,404;a long walk to Castle Black.
357;00:28:26,946;00:28:28,239;I hope you enjoy the Wall.
358;00:28:28,823;00:28:31,159;I found it surprisingly beautiful,
359;00:28:31,743;00:28:35,330;in a brutal, horribly
359;00:28:31,743;00:28:35,330;uncomfortable sort of way.
360;00:28:35,622;00:28:36,831;The lads will escort you.
361;00:28:37,248;00:28:39,042;The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.
362;00:28:39,375;00:28:41,169;These men are under my command.
363;00:28:41,961;00:28:43,838;I command you to arrest this cutthroat.
364;00:28:43,963;00:28:47,842;His name is Bronn and he is the
364;00:28:43,963;00:28:47,842;new commander of the City Watch.
365;00:28:48,968;00:28:49,636;Boys.
366;00:28:52,430;00:28:53,973;I have friends at court.
367;00:28:54,474;00:28:55,600;Powerful friends.
368;00:28:56,976;00:28:58,770;The king himself made me a lord.
369;00:29:04,234;00:29:05,318;To the new Commander.
370;00:29:12,575;00:29:18,540;If I told you to murder, an infant girl
370;00:29:12,575;00:29:18,540;say, still at her mother's breast,
371;00:29:20,166;00:29:21,835;would you do it without question?
372;00:29:24,379;00:29:26,005;Without question? No.
373;00:29:27,173;00:29:28,299;I'd ask how much.
374;00:29:46,651;00:29:48,486;If they come back, I say we yield.
375;00:29:49,195;00:29:50,113;Gendry's the one they want.
376;00:29:50,572;00:29:51,948;I don't want to get caught
376;00:29:50,572;00:29:51,948;in the middle of a battle.
377;00:29:52,365;00:29:53,992;I'm not afraid of no battles.
378;00:29:54,117;00:29:56,703;If you got within a mile of a
378;00:29:54,117;00:29:56,703;battle, you'd fill your pants.
379;00:29:56,995;00:29:58,121;I've seen lots of battles.
380;00:29:58,538;00:29:59,497;I saw...
380;00:29:58,538;00:29:59,497;Liar.
381;00:30:00,123;00:30:04,586;I saw a man kill another man just
381;00:30:00,123;00:30:04,586;outside a tavern in Flea Bottom.
382;00:30:04,919;00:30:06,671;Stabbed him right in the neck.
383;00:30:07,213;00:30:09,090;Two men fighting isn't a battle.
384;00:30:09,757;00:30:11,134;They had armor on.
385;00:30:11,926;00:30:12,552;So?
386;00:30:13,178;00:30:15,263;So, if they got armor on, it's a battle.
387;00:30:15,388;00:30:16,264;No, it isn't.
388;00:30:17,348;00:30:19,642;What's a dyer's apprentice
388;00:30:17,348;00:30:19,642;know about battles anyway?
389;00:30:20,018;00:30:21,436;Gendry's an armorer's apprentice.
390;00:30:22,312;00:30:25,023;Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle.
391;00:30:27,066;00:30:29,569;It's when they've got armor on.
392;00:30:29,694;00:30:30,612;I already told you that.
393;00:30:32,447;00:30:33,406;A knight?
394;00:30:34,616;00:30:35,533;How'd you know he was a knight?
395;00:30:37,869;00:30:40,538;Well, cause they got armor on.
396;00:30:41,164;00:30:42,832;You don't have to be a
396;00:30:41,164;00:30:42,832;knight to have armor.
397;00:30:43,208;00:30:44,417;Any idiot can buy armor.
398;00:30:45,001;00:30:45,710;How'd you know?
399;00:30:46,878;00:30:48,129;Cause I sold armor.
400;00:31:01,643;00:31:03,061;What do the gold-clips want with you?
401;00:31:03,561;00:31:04,479;No idea.
402;00:31:04,938;00:31:05,855;You're a liar.
403;00:31:06,064;00:31:08,107;You shouldn't insult people
403;00:31:06,064;00:31:08,107;that are bigger than you.
404;00:31:08,691;00:31:10,485;Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone.
405;00:31:11,110;00:31:12,403;No one gets to insult anyone.
406;00:31:13,363;00:31:15,156;No good's ever come of those questions.
407;00:31:15,281;00:31:16,491;No good's ever come?
408;00:31:17,700;00:31:19,160;You've asked questions before?
409;00:31:19,285;00:31:22,580;How can someone so small be
409;00:31:19,285;00:31:22,580;such a huge pain in my ass?
410;00:31:22,956;00:31:23,998;Were you asked questions?
411;00:31:26,793;00:31:29,796;The Hand of the King.
411;00:31:26,793;00:31:29,796;The Hands of the King.
412;00:31:31,256;00:31:34,050;Lord Arryn came first, a
412;00:31:31,256;00:31:34,050;few weeks before he died.
413;00:31:34,175;00:31:37,595;And then Lord Stark came, a
413;00:31:34,175;00:31:37,595;few weeks before he died.
414;00:31:38,429;00:31:39,222;Lord Stark.
415;00:31:40,306;00:31:43,852;See? Asking me questions is bad luck.
416;00:31:45,728;00:31:47,230;You'll probably be dead soon.
417;00:31:48,648;00:31:49,983;What did they ask about?
418;00:31:50,358;00:31:52,819;My mom.
418;00:31:50,358;00:31:52,819;Who's your mom?
419;00:31:53,194;00:31:54,737;Just my mom.
420;00:31:54,863;00:31:56,656;Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.
421;00:31:57,031;00:31:57,991;And who was your father?
422;00:31:58,408;00:32:01,119;He could be one of those gold-hatted
422;00:31:58,408;00:32:01,119;bastards, for all I know.
423;00:32:01,619;00:32:02,787;What about you, anyway?
424;00:32:03,997;00:32:05,206;I thought they were after you?
425;00:32:06,791;00:32:07,500;Why?
426;00:32:08,918;00:32:11,296;Did you kill someone?
426;00:32:08,918;00:32:11,296;Or is it just because you're a girl?
427;00:32:12,005;00:32:12,964;I'm not a girl!
428;00:32:13,256;00:32:14,048;Yes you are.
429;00:32:14,799;00:32:16,342;You think I'm as stupid
429;00:32:14,799;00:32:16,342;as the rest of them?
430;00:32:16,551;00:32:19,637;Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls.
430;00:32:16,551;00:32:19,637;Everyone knows that.
431;00:32:19,762;00:32:21,055;That's true. You're still a girl.
432;00:32:21,139;00:32:21,973;I am not!
433;00:32:22,015;00:32:23,892;Well, pull your cock out
433;00:32:22,015;00:32:23,892;and take a piss then.
434;00:32:25,935;00:32:27,061;I don't need to take a piss.
435;00:32:33,693;00:32:35,069;I'm in hot pike, aren't I now?
436;00:32:36,237;00:32:37,030;No one can know.
437;00:32:37,530;00:32:39,991;They won't. Not from me.
438;00:32:43,995;00:32:45,121;My name's not Arry.
439;00:32:46,831;00:32:49,834;It's Arya. Of House Stark.
440;00:32:51,252;00:32:53,046;Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
441;00:32:54,589;00:32:57,634;He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.
442;00:32:57,717;00:32:58,927;He was never a traitor.
443;00:32:59,802;00:33:00,929;Joffrey is a liar.
444;00:33:02,514;00:33:04,724;So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.
444;00:33:02,514;00:33:04,724;No.
445;00:33:05,099;00:33:05,892;I mean yes.
446;00:33:06,351;00:33:08,061;My mother was a lady, and my sister.
447;00:33:08,102;00:33:10,396;You were a lord's daughter
447;00:33:08,102;00:33:10,396;and you lived in a castle.
448;00:33:11,856;00:33:13,483;Look, all that about cocks.
448;00:33:11,856;00:33:13,483;I should never have said that.
449;00:33:14,692;00:33:16,402;I've been pissing in front
449;00:33:14,692;00:33:16,402;of you and everything.
450;00:33:18,071;00:33:19,322;I should be calling you milady.
451;00:33:19,364;00:33:20,740;Do not call me milady.
452;00:33:20,782;00:33:21,783;As milady commands.
453;00:33:22,909;00:33:23,868;Well, that was unladylike.
454;00:33:53,481;00:33:54,566;What you carrying?
455;00:33:56,818;00:33:57,986;Pears and oranges.
456;00:33:58,653;00:33:59,654;Wine from the Arbor.
457;00:34:01,364;00:34:03,491;And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands.
458;00:34:07,203;00:34:10,123;The only living son of Balon Greyjoy.
459;00:34:14,043;00:34:14,794;Me.
460;00:34:16,880;00:34:18,173;Don't like wine.
461;00:34:19,215;00:34:20,133;Woman's drink.
462;00:34:23,887;00:34:25,013;I need to get to Pyke.
463;00:34:35,315;00:34:36,858;I'll find you a horse.
464;00:34:47,994;00:34:48,995;I'm heading that way.
465;00:34:49,913;00:34:50,997;I can take you there.
466;00:34:52,373;00:34:53,458;I bet you can.
467;00:34:54,209;00:34:55,376;You been at sea long?
468;00:34:56,127;00:34:58,254;Or were there just no women
468;00:34:56,127;00:34:58,254;where you came from?
469;00:34:58,630;00:34:59,506;None like you.
470;00:34:59,839;00:35:01,007;You don't know what I'm like.
471;00:35:01,508;00:35:02,717;You don't know what you're like.
472;00:35:03,635;00:35:05,470;You need someone to teach you.
473;00:35:06,971;00:35:08,139;Know who I am?
474;00:35:08,890;00:35:11,684;You think I offer free rides
474;00:35:08,890;00:35:11,684;to every man in jewelry.
475;00:35:12,977;00:35:14,437;Lord Greyjoy.
476;00:35:17,398;00:35:19,025;Have my things sent up to the castle.
477;00:35:37,043;00:35:39,963;You should give me the reins,
477;00:35:37,043;00:35:39,963;I'm a better rider than you.
478;00:35:40,505;00:35:42,298;I've been on horseback
478;00:35:40,505;00:35:42,298;for the last nine years.
479;00:35:42,799;00:35:46,010;Nine years. You still know
479;00:35:42,799;00:35:46,010;your way around a ship?
480;00:35:46,761;00:35:48,638;Have these hands ever touched a rope?
481;00:35:49,138;00:35:50,682;Don't you worry about my hands.
482;00:35:53,184;00:35:54,519;The sea's in my blood.
483;00:35:55,520;00:35:58,022;You'll never be in the sea if I
483;00:35:55,520;00:35:58,022;don't watch where I'm going.
484;00:35:58,773;00:36:00,441;I have a proposal for my father.
485;00:36:01,776;00:36:03,987;One that will make him king again.
486;00:36:04,487;00:36:05,822;And me after him.
487;00:36:08,825;00:36:11,077;You may stay at the castle
487;00:36:08,825;00:36:11,077;tonight, if you're lucky.
488;00:36:11,870;00:36:13,454;Is that an offer from my future king?
489;00:36:13,496;00:36:15,415;An order. From your future king.
490;00:36:18,209;00:36:20,253;You can tell your grandchildren
490;00:36:18,209;00:36:20,253;about this night.
491;00:36:20,962;00:36:23,506;I don't imagine it will be
491;00:36:20,962;00:36:23,506;a story fit for children.
492;00:36:36,895;00:36:38,062;Father.
493;00:36:39,522;00:36:41,357;Nine years, is it?
494;00:36:42,609;00:36:44,694;They took a frightened boy.
495;00:36:45,445;00:36:46,779;What have they given back?
496;00:36:48,615;00:36:49,949;A man.
497;00:36:50,783;00:36:53,161;Your blood and your heir.
497;00:36:50,783;00:36:53,161;We shall see.
498;00:36:55,371;00:36:57,498;Stark had you longer than I did.
499;00:36:58,625;00:36:59,834;Lord Stark is gone.
500;00:37:02,337;00:37:04,756;And how do you feel about that?
501;00:37:08,676;00:37:09,594;What's done is done.
502;00:37:11,304;00:37:12,972;I've brought you a
502;00:37:11,304;00:37:12,972;proposal from Robb Stark.
503;00:37:12,972;00:37:14,474;Who gave you those clothes?
504;00:37:16,017;00:37:19,312;Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
504;00:37:16,017;00:37:19,312;to make you his daughter?
505;00:37:20,396;00:37:22,482;If my clothes offend you,
505;00:37:20,396;00:37:22,482;I will change them.
506;00:37:22,524;00:37:23,441;It will.
507;00:37:25,735;00:37:27,487;That bauble around your neck.
508;00:37:27,904;00:37:30,949;Did you pay the iron price
508;00:37:27,904;00:37:30,949;for it or the gold?
509;00:37:32,116;00:37:33,576;I asked a question.
510;00:37:33,868;00:37:36,496;Did you pull it from the
510;00:37:33,868;00:37:36,496;neck of a corpse you made
511;00:37:36,746;00:37:40,625;or did you buy it to
511;00:37:36,746;00:37:40,625;match your fine clothes?
512;00:37:43,002;00:37:45,088;Iron or gold?
513;00:37:48,258;00:37:49,175;Gold.
514;00:37:54,305;00:37:56,808;I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.
515;00:38:00,520;00:38:02,063;My fears have come true.
516;00:38:02,814;00:38:04,732;The Starks have made you theirs.
517;00:38:04,858;00:38:06,526;My blood is salt and iron.
518;00:38:06,568;00:38:10,280;Yet, the Stark boy sends you
518;00:38:06,568;00:38:10,280;to me like a trained raven,
519;00:38:10,363;00:38:11,573;clutching his message.
520;00:38:11,656;00:38:13,700;The offer he makes, is one I proposed.
521;00:38:13,741;00:38:15,076;He heeds your counsel?
522;00:38:15,201;00:38:17,829;I've lived with him, hunted
522;00:38:15,201;00:38:17,829;with him, fought at his side,
523;00:38:17,871;00:38:19,205;he thinks of me as a brother.
524;00:38:19,205;00:38:24,711;No, not here, not in my hearing,
524;00:38:19,205;00:38:24,711;you will not name him brother.
525;00:38:24,711;00:38:28,715;This son of the man who put your
525;00:38:24,711;00:38:28,715;true brothers to the sword.
526;00:38:28,840;00:38:31,301;Or have you forgotten your own blood?
527;00:38:31,718;00:38:32,886;I forget nothing.
528;00:38:33,511;00:38:34,971;I remember my brothers.
529;00:38:36,598;00:38:38,766;And I remember when my father was a king.
530;00:38:55,575;00:38:56,659;I see.
531;00:38:57,493;00:39:00,079;I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him
532;00:39:00,205;00:39:03,541;and he will make me King of
532;00:39:00,205;00:39:03,541;the Iron Islands once again.
533;00:39:03,666;00:39:05,168;I will lead the attack myself.
534;00:39:05,251;00:39:06,461;Oh, you will?
535;00:39:07,587;00:39:09,714;I'm your son. Your only living heir.
536;00:39:10,298;00:39:11,257;Who else?
537;00:39:14,552;00:39:16,304;I told you to wait outside.
538;00:39:18,181;00:39:19,682;How did you get past the guards?
539;00:39:19,766;00:39:22,018;Anything with a cock is easy to fool.
540;00:39:23,186;00:39:24,687;My dear.
541;00:39:28,483;00:39:32,237;Yara?
541;00:39:28,483;00:39:32,237;So good to see you, brother.
542;00:39:33,071;00:39:36,241;This is a homecoming I'll
542;00:39:33,071;00:39:36,241;tell my grandchildren about.
543;00:39:39,369;00:39:40,662;She can't lead an attack.
544;00:39:40,703;00:39:41,663;And why not?
545;00:39:42,747;00:39:43,790;You're a woman.
546;00:39:43,831;00:39:45,041;You're the one in skirts.
547;00:39:45,166;00:39:46,751;This isn't Winterfell, boy.
548;00:39:47,418;00:39:49,963;Your sister took over command
548;00:39:47,418;00:39:49,963;of your eldest brother's ship
549;00:39:50,088;00:39:52,757;after your new father killed him.
550;00:39:52,882;00:39:55,385;What's dead may never die.
551;00:39:56,719;00:40:00,390;The only night she's spent off these
551;00:39:56,719;00:40:00,390;islands has been spent on the sea.
552;00:40:01,391;00:40:05,061;She's commanded men. She's killed men.
553;00:40:05,645;00:40:07,814;She knows who she is.
554;00:40:10,608;00:40:12,610;No man gives me a crown.
555;00:40:13,444;00:40:15,488;I pay the iron price.
556;00:40:16,364;00:40:18,157;I will take my crown.
557;00:40:18,658;00:40:20,159;That is who I am.
558;00:40:21,661;00:40:23,788;That is who we have always been.
559;00:40:28,751;00:40:31,004;You won't stand a chance against
559;00:40:28,751;00:40:31,004;the Lannisters on your own.
560;00:40:31,045;00:40:33,131;Who said anything about the Lannisters?
561;00:40:41,264;00:40:44,225;You'll have your gold when we take
561;00:40:41,264;00:40:44,225;the treasury at King's Landing.
562;00:40:44,350;00:40:48,605;All these kings fighting for the throne
562;00:40:44,350;00:40:48,605;and this Stannis has the smallest army.
563;00:40:49,314;00:40:51,149;Why would I bet on the man
563;00:40:49,314;00:40:51,149;with the worst chance?
564;00:40:51,691;00:40:53,359;Because you're a smart gambler.
565;00:40:54,485;00:40:56,529;Stannis has proved himself in war.
565;00:40:54,485;00:40:56,529;Twice.
566;00:40:57,447;00:41:00,116;His baby brother has never
566;00:40:57,447;00:41:00,116;set foot on a battlefield.
567;00:41:00,783;00:41:02,535;Neither has the false king, Joffrey.
568;00:41:02,577;00:41:04,370;And yet, they both have larger armies.
569;00:41:04,412;00:41:05,914;Stannis has just begun the fight.
570;00:41:06,706;00:41:09,125;His bannermen will rally to his cause.
571;00:41:10,251;00:41:14,464;There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms
571;00:41:10,251;00:41:14,464;more honorable than Stannis Baratheon.
572;00:41:14,756;00:41:15,840;Or more worthy of loyalty.
573;00:41:15,965;00:41:20,220;What is the world coming to when smugglers
573;00:41:15,965;00:41:20,220;must vouch for the honor of kings.
574;00:41:20,261;00:41:22,096;Mind your words, pirate.
574;00:41:20,261;00:41:22,096;Matthos.
575;00:41:22,722;00:41:23,723;You think I'm insulted?
576;00:41:24,307;00:41:27,227;I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate.
577;00:41:27,644;00:41:29,229;I don't sail for promises.
578;00:41:29,354;00:41:30,230;Of course you do.
579;00:41:31,189;00:41:33,316;Every time you leave harbor,
579;00:41:31,189;00:41:33,316;you're leaving on a promise.
580;00:41:34,192;00:41:35,568;A promise that somewhere on the seas,
581;00:41:35,610;00:41:37,737;somebody's got some gold and
581;00:41:35,610;00:41:37,737;you can take it from them.
582;00:41:37,779;00:41:39,239;That's a promise that always comes true.
583;00:41:39,280;00:41:40,073;As is mine.
584;00:41:41,032;00:41:42,617;You're not the young man, Salladhor.
585;00:41:43,076;00:41:46,704;And correct me if I'm wrong,
585;00:41:43,076;00:41:46,704;most pirates don't grow old.
586;00:41:47,539;00:41:48,915;Only the clever ones.
587;00:41:49,541;00:41:51,835;You want to spend your
587;00:41:49,541;00:41:51,835;last few years on the sea,
588;00:41:51,835;00:41:55,129;stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers
588;00:41:51,835;00:41:55,129;and Midanese silk merchants,
589;00:41:55,129;00:41:55,797;then go.
590;00:41:55,839;00:41:56,631;They're out there waiting for you.
591;00:41:57,340;00:41:58,216;That's easy.
592;00:41:59,300;00:42:00,802;What I'm offering you is hard.
593;00:42:03,346;00:42:06,057;Come with me and plunder the
593;00:42:03,346;00:42:06,057;greatest city in Westeros.
594;00:42:07,225;00:42:09,644;You'll be the richest man in Lysene.
594;00:42:07,225;00:42:09,644;And the most famous.
595;00:42:09,894;00:42:13,356;They'll be singing songs about you
595;00:42:09,894;00:42:13,356;as long as men have voices to sing.
596;00:42:15,608;00:42:17,527;Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.
597;00:42:17,652;00:42:18,403;It is.
598;00:42:19,195;00:42:21,906;One thing, I want the queen.
598;00:42:19,195;00:42:21,906;The queen?
599;00:42:22,031;00:42:23,867;Cersei, I want her.
600;00:42:24,200;00:42:26,578;I'll sail with your fleet,
600;00:42:24,200;00:42:26,578;all 30 of my ships,
601;00:42:26,870;00:42:29,038;and if we don't drown at the
601;00:42:26,870;00:42:29,038;bottom of Blackwater Bay,
602;00:42:29,163;00:42:32,292;I will fuck this blonde queen
602;00:42:29,163;00:42:32,292;and I will fuck her well.
603;00:42:32,417;00:42:33,960;This war isn't about you.
604;00:42:35,295;00:42:37,714;We're not attacking King's Landing
604;00:42:35,295;00:42:37,714;so that you can rape the queen.
605;00:42:38,173;00:42:40,717;I'm not going to rape her,
605;00:42:38,173;00:42:40,717;I'm going to fuck her.
606;00:42:41,259;00:42:42,343;As if she would just let you.
607;00:42:42,468;00:42:44,220;You don't know how persuasive I am.
608;00:42:45,138;00:42:46,472;I never tried to fuck you.
609;00:42:48,892;00:42:50,518;Stannis is the rightful king.
610;00:42:50,643;00:42:52,145;And the Lord of Light.
611;00:42:52,270;00:42:53,188;The one true god.
612;00:42:53,188;00:42:54,856;I've been all over the world, my boy,
613;00:42:54,856;00:42:57,650;and everywhere I go, people
613;00:42:54,856;00:42:57,650;tell me about the true god.
614;00:42:57,942;00:42:59,611;They all think they found the right one.
615;00:43:00,195;00:43:02,947;The one true god is what's
615;00:43:00,195;00:43:02,947;between a woman's legs,
616;00:43:03,239;00:43:05,200;and better yet a queen's legs.
617;00:43:07,202;00:43:09,245;I never thought you'd have
617;00:43:07,202;00:43:09,245;a true believer for a son.
618;00:43:09,454;00:43:10,455;He's young yet.
619;00:43:11,956;00:43:13,458;I promise you the gold.
620;00:43:13,917;00:43:16,711;I promise you the glory.
620;00:43:13,917;00:43:16,711;I cannot promise you the queen.
621;00:43:20,340;00:43:21,549;You believe your king can win?
622;00:43:22,509;00:43:24,385;He is the one true king.
623;00:43:24,761;00:43:26,346;You Westerosers are funny people.
624;00:43:26,471;00:43:29,849;A man chops off your fingers
624;00:43:26,471;00:43:29,849;and you fall in love with him.
625;00:43:31,726;00:43:33,853;I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth.
626;00:43:33,978;00:43:36,773;You are the most honest
626;00:43:33,978;00:43:36,773;smuggler I ever met.
627;00:43:37,482;00:43:38,942;Make me rich.
628;00:43:40,109;00:43:42,820;Get me to the gates of
628;00:43:40,109;00:43:42,820;King's Landing and I will.
629;00:43:55,041;00:43:56,668;When will the King have a sail?
630;00:43:57,126;00:43:58,711;As soon as his God wills it.
631;00:43:58,837;00:44:01,047;He's my God too, and yours...
632;00:44:01,589;00:44:03,424;but you were too blind to see.
633;00:44:06,135;00:44:08,471;Let me teach you how to read.
633;00:44:06,135;00:44:08,471;Oh you and your mother.
634;00:44:08,596;00:44:10,014;It won't take long you
634;00:44:08,596;00:44:10,014;already know the letters.
635;00:44:10,139;00:44:12,517;The holy books are much more
635;00:44:10,139;00:44:12,517;persuasive than I can be.
636;00:44:12,642;00:44:14,143;I wish I had a God, truly!
637;00:44:14,269;00:44:15,728;I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men
638;00:44:15,854;00:44:19,482;pray to every God there is. Pray for wind,
638;00:44:15,854;00:44:19,482;pray for rain, pray for home,
639;00:44:19,607;00:44:22,068;None of it works!
639;00:44:19,607;00:44:22,068;But you always came home.
640;00:44:22,193;00:44:23,862;I wasn't praying, you know.
641;00:44:24,487;00:44:26,114;But I was.
642;00:44:27,407;00:44:29,158;Every night that you're at sea,
643;00:44:29,284;00:44:31,911;I lit a candle and I prayed for you.
644;00:44:33,496;00:44:35,999;You want me to have a god, fine.
645;00:44:36,374;00:44:37,876;King Stannis is my god.
646;00:44:38,209;00:44:40,420;He raised me up and blessed
646;00:44:38,209;00:44:40,420;me with his trust.
647;00:44:40,712;00:44:42,005;He gave you a future
648;00:44:42,130;00:44:43,590;I could never have imagined.
649;00:44:43,715;00:44:45,592;You know how to read,
649;00:44:43,715;00:44:45,592;you'll be a knight someday.
650;00:44:45,717;00:44:48,553;You think your fire god commanded all that?
651;00:44:48,678;00:44:50,054;It was Stannis.
652;00:44:50,430;00:44:52,223;Only Stannis.
653;00:44:52,557;00:44:55,351;Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.
654;00:44:55,476;00:44:57,312;Don't tell him that.
655;00:44:59,856;00:45:02,066;Lord Janos Slynt was
655;00:44:59,856;00:45:02,066;Commander of the City Watch.
656;00:45:02,192;00:45:03,651;You had no right to exile him.
657;00:45:03,776;00:45:05,528;I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
658;00:45:05,653;00:45:08,072;You're serving as the King's
658;00:45:05,653;00:45:08,072;Hand until father gets here.
659;00:45:08,198;00:45:10,825;I am Queen Regent.
659;00:45:08,198;00:45:10,825;Listen to me, Queen Regent,
660;00:45:10,950;00:45:12,535;you're losing the people.
661;00:45:13,536;00:45:15,705;Do you hear me?
661;00:45:13,536;00:45:15,705;The people?
662;00:45:16,122;00:45:17,540;You think I care?
663;00:45:17,665;00:45:21,085;You might find it difficult
663;00:45:17,665;00:45:21,085;to rule over millions who want you dead.
664;00:45:22,128;00:45:26,174;Half the city will starve when winter comes.
664;00:45:22,128;00:45:26,174;The other half will plot to overthrow you.
665;00:45:26,591;00:45:30,094;And gold-plated foes
665;00:45:26,591;00:45:30,094;just gave them the rallying cry.
666;00:45:30,553;00:45:32,847;The Queen slaughters babies.
667;00:45:35,433;00:45:37,936;You don't even have the decency to deny it.
668;00:45:48,279;00:45:51,115;It wasn't you who gave the order, was it?
669;00:45:51,783;00:45:53,743;Joffrey didn't even tell you.
670;00:45:55,995;00:45:57,539;Did he tell you?
671;00:45:58,206;00:45:59,958;I imagine that would be even worse.
672;00:46:00,083;00:46:01,751;He did what needed to be done.
673;00:46:02,669;00:46:04,212;You want to be the Hand of the King?
674;00:46:04,337;00:46:05,421;You want to rule?
675;00:46:05,547;00:46:06,881;This is what ruling is!
676;00:46:07,006;00:46:08,508;Lying on a bed of weeds,
677;00:46:08,633;00:46:12,387;ripping them out by the root one by one
677;00:46:08,633;00:46:12,387;before they strangle you in your sleep.
678;00:46:12,512;00:46:14,848;I'm no king, but I think there's
678;00:46:12,512;00:46:14,848;more to ruling that that.
679;00:46:14,973;00:46:16,516;I don't care what you think!
680;00:46:17,100;00:46:18,560;You've never taken it seriously.
681;00:46:18,685;00:46:20,562;You haven't, Jaime hasn't.
682;00:46:23,898;00:46:26,359;It's all fallen on me.
683;00:46:30,405;00:46:33,950;As has Jaime repeatedly,
683;00:46:30,405;00:46:33,950;according to Stannis Baratheon.
684;00:46:39,038;00:46:41,457;You're funny.
685;00:46:43,835;00:46:46,713;You've always been funny.
686;00:46:47,755;00:46:51,426;But none of your jokes will ever match
686;00:46:47,755;00:46:51,426;the first one, will they?
687;00:46:52,677;00:46:54,387;You remember...
688;00:46:55,597;00:46:59,851;Back when you ripped my mother open on
688;00:46:55,597;00:46:59,851;your way out of her and she bled to death.
689;00:47:01,853;00:47:03,563;She was my mother too.
690;00:47:04,230;00:47:05,440;Now they're gone,
691;00:47:08,067;00:47:09,611;for the sake of you.
692;00:47:12,864;00:47:15,033;There's no bigger joke
692;00:47:12,864;00:47:15,033;in the world than that.
693;00:47:37,430;00:47:40,433;Your Grace.
693;00:47:37,430;00:47:40,433;Your Grace.
694;00:47:40,558;00:47:42,769;How did it fare with your pirate?
695;00:47:42,894;00:47:45,021;Salladhor Saan will join our fleet.
696;00:47:45,146;00:47:47,857;30 ships, his men know how to fight.
697;00:47:48,399;00:47:51,569;In my experience, pirates
697;00:47:48,399;00:47:51,569;prefer fighting unarmed men.
698;00:47:52,153;00:47:55,657;Does seem the wiser choice.
698;00:47:52,153;00:47:55,657;It won't be a choice this time.
699;00:47:56,950;00:47:58,284;Do you trust him?
700;00:47:59,118;00:48:02,080;Salladhor Saan is an old friend,
700;00:47:59,118;00:48:02,080;I've known him 30 years.
701;00:48:02,580;00:48:04,290;I've never trusted him.
702;00:48:05,083;00:48:07,710;Now once he gets the smell
702;00:48:05,083;00:48:07,710;of gold, he never stops.
703;00:48:08,878;00:48:11,422;Well if he does his job,
703;00:48:08,878;00:48:11,422;he'll have his share.
704;00:48:15,802;00:48:17,220;Leave us.
705;00:48:23,643;00:48:25,228;At once, Your Grace.
706;00:48:31,901;00:48:34,696;The Lord of Light shines
706;00:48:31,901;00:48:34,696;through you, young warrior.
707;00:48:40,493;00:48:41,953;Come.
708;00:48:49,335;00:48:50,545;What did you say to him?
709;00:48:50,670;00:48:54,340;I told him death by fire
709;00:48:50,670;00:48:54,340;is the purest death.
710;00:48:54,674;00:48:57,302;Why?
710;00:48:54,674;00:48:57,302;Because it is true.
711;00:48:58,720;00:49:00,513;You're troubled my king.
712;00:49:00,972;00:49:01,931;Yeah.
713;00:49:02,223;00:49:05,268;These armies are but toys
713;00:49:02,223;00:49:05,268;for the Lord of Light.
714;00:49:05,393;00:49:07,020;Tell your lord to burn them then.
715;00:49:07,687;00:49:09,522;I tell him nothing!
716;00:49:09,647;00:49:12,775;I pray for his commands and I obey.
717;00:49:14,569;00:49:17,739;My little brother has a hundred
717;00:49:14,569;00:49:17,739;thousand men according to the scouts.
718;00:49:18,531;00:49:21,034;Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
719;00:49:21,409;00:49:24,329;You must have faith.
719;00:49:21,409;00:49:24,329;Faith?
720;00:49:26,372;00:49:30,877;In a real war, the side with the greater
720;00:49:26,372;00:49:30,877;number wins nine times out of ten.
721;00:49:31,336;00:49:32,837;Then we must be the ten.
722;00:49:32,962;00:49:35,798;I cannot defeat my brother in the field,
723;00:49:37,217;00:49:39,761;and I can't take King's Landing
723;00:49:37,217;00:49:39,761;without the men he stole.
724;00:49:42,388;00:49:45,433;I have seen the path to
724;00:49:42,388;00:49:45,433;victory in the flames.
725;00:49:47,477;00:49:50,730;At first, you must give
725;00:49:47,477;00:49:50,730;yourself to the Lord of Light.
726;00:49:50,855;00:49:53,733;I've said the words, damn you.
727;00:49:56,945;00:49:58,905;I burnt the idols.
728;00:50:02,659;00:50:05,912;You must give all of yourself.
729;00:50:11,000;00:50:12,961;I have a wife.
730;00:50:14,504;00:50:16,130;I took a vow.
731;00:50:17,715;00:50:19,467;She's sick.
732;00:50:20,552;00:50:22,178;Weak.
733;00:50:22,762;00:50:25,098;Shut away in the tower.
734;00:50:26,516;00:50:27,976;She disgusts you.
735;00:50:31,604;00:50:33,773;And she's giving you nothing.
736;00:50:34,941;00:50:36,109;No sons.
737;00:50:36,985;00:50:39,112;Only stillborns.
738;00:50:39,571;00:50:41,155;Only death.
739;00:50:47,579;00:50:49,038;I will give you...
740;00:50:49,956;00:50:51,666;a son, my King.
741;00:50:54,502;00:50:55,920;A son?
