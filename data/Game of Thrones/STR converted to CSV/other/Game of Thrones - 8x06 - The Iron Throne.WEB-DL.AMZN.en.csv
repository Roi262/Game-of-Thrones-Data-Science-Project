3;00:00:12,567;00:00:13,775;Give them that chance.

5;00:00:16,233;00:00:17,899;they will ring the bells
5;00:00:16,233;00:00:17,899;and raise the gates.

7;00:04:53,400;00:04:54,941;I'll find you later.
8;00:04:57,650;00:04:58,692;It's not safe.
9;00:05:02,149;00:05:03,858;Let me send some men with you.
10;00:05:07,858;00:05:09,191;I'm going alone.
11;00:05:55,066;00:05:57,108;In the name of the one true queen,
12;00:05:57,191;00:05:58,483;Daenerys Targaryen,
13;00:05:59,608;00:06:01,275;I sentence you to die.
14;00:06:02,275;00:06:03,608;Grey Worm!
15;00:06:10,650;00:06:12,358;It's over.
16;00:06:12,441;00:06:13,817;These men are prisoners.
17;00:06:13,899;00:06:16,525;It is not over until the queen's
17;00:06:13,899;00:06:16,525;enemies are defeated.
18;00:06:16,608;00:06:18,775;How much more defeated
18;00:06:16,608;00:06:18,775;do you want them to be?
19;00:06:18,858;00:06:20,941;They're on their knees.
19;00:06:18,858;00:06:20,941;They are breathing.
20;00:06:22,108;00:06:24,066;Look around you, friend. We won.
21;00:06:24,149;00:06:26,483;I obey my queen's commands, not yours.
22;00:06:26,567;00:06:28,858;And what are the queen's commands?
23;00:06:30,149;00:06:33,316;Kill all who follow
23;00:06:30,149;00:06:33,316;Cersei Lannister.
24;00:06:34,233;00:06:35,608;These are free men.
25;00:06:36,567;00:06:38,650;They chose to fight for her.
26;00:06:41,316;00:06:43,817;Easy, men. Easy! Easy.
27;00:06:53,775;00:06:54,733;Jon.
28;00:06:57,441;00:06:59,650;We should speak with the queen.
29;00:12:13,608;00:12:15,149;Hyah!
30;00:15:30,817;00:15:31,899;Torgo Nudho.
31;00:18:13,817;00:18:15,650;You freed your brother.
32;00:18:17,066;00:18:18,817;You committed treason.
33;00:18:20,316;00:18:22,650;I freed my brother.
34;00:18:25,400;00:18:27,899;And you slaughtered a city.
35;00:20:21,941;00:20:23,941;What are you doing here?
36;00:20:26,650;00:20:29,525;Hey, what happened?
37;00:20:29,608;00:20:31,358;I came to kill Cersei.
38;00:20:32,775;00:20:34,483;Your queen got there first.
39;00:20:38,983;00:20:41,024;She's everyone's queen now.
40;00:20:41,108;00:20:43,650;Try telling Sansa.
41;00:20:50,483;00:20:52,149;Wait for me outside the city gates.
42;00:20:52,233;00:20:53,983;I'll come find you.
42;00:20:52,233;00:20:53,983;Jon.
43;00:20:56,149;00:20:57,525;She knows who you are.
44;00:20:58,817;00:21:00,149;Who you really are.
45;00:21:00,233;00:21:02,650;You'll always be a threat to her.
46;00:21:05,191;00:21:07,733;And I know a killer when I see one.
47;00:21:40,149;00:21:41,899;Did you bring any wine?
48;00:21:43,149;00:21:44,191;No.
49;00:21:45,817;00:21:47,316;Ah...
50;00:21:47,400;00:21:48,358;Well...
51;00:21:50,316;00:21:52,525;thank you for coming to see me.
52;00:21:53,817;00:21:56,858;Our queen doesn't keep prisoners
52;00:21:53,817;00:21:56,858;for long.
53;00:21:58,358;00:22:01,441;I suppose there's
53;00:21:58,358;00:22:01,441;a crude kind of justice.
54;00:22:03,233;00:22:07,108;I betrayed my closest friend
54;00:22:03,233;00:22:07,108;and watched him burn.
55;00:22:07,191;00:22:10,316;Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes:
56;00:22:10,400;00:22:12,899;See, I told you.
57;00:22:17,567;00:22:19,525;It just occurred to me.
58;00:22:19,608;00:22:21,233;I'm talking to the only man alive
59;00:22:21,316;00:22:23,275;who knows where I'm going.
60;00:22:24,775;00:22:27,066;So is there life after death?
61;00:22:30,400;00:22:31,899;Not that I've seen.
62;00:22:33,149;00:22:35,441;I should be thankful.
63;00:22:35,525;00:22:38,400;Oblivion is the best I could hope for.
64;00:22:39,733;00:22:41,817;I strangled my lover.
65;00:22:41,899;00:22:44,149;I shot my own father with a crossbow.
66;00:22:44,233;00:22:45,358;I betrayed my queen.
67;00:22:45,441;00:22:46,941;You didn't.
67;00:22:45,441;00:22:46,941;I did.
68;00:22:48,775;00:22:49,817;And I'd do it again,
69;00:22:49,899;00:22:52,108;now that I've seen what I've seen.
70;00:22:53,441;00:22:55,441;I chose my fate.
71;00:22:55,525;00:22:58,316;The people of King's Landing did not.
72;00:23:00,608;00:23:02,817;I can't justify what happened.
73;00:23:04,525;00:23:05,608;I won't try.
74;00:23:08,899;00:23:11,692;But the war is over now.
74;00:23:08,899;00:23:11,692;Is it?
75;00:23:14,024;00:23:16,983;When you heard her
75;00:23:14,024;00:23:16,983;talking to her soldiers,
76;00:23:17,066;00:23:20,191;did she sound like someone
76;00:23:17,066;00:23:20,191;who's done fighting?
77;00:23:28,483;00:23:31,316;She liberated the people
77;00:23:28,483;00:23:31,316;of Slaver's Bay.
78;00:23:31,400;00:23:34,525;She liberated the people
78;00:23:31,400;00:23:34,525;of King's Landing.
79;00:23:34,608;00:23:36,400;And she'll go on liberating
80;00:23:36,483;00:23:39,567;until the people of the world
80;00:23:36,483;00:23:39,567;are free...
81;00:23:39,650;00:23:40,983;and she rules them all.
82;00:23:41,066;00:23:44,400;And you've been by her side,
82;00:23:41,066;00:23:44,400;counseling her.
83;00:23:44,483;00:23:45,858;Until today.
84;00:23:47,400;00:23:48,650;Until today.
85;00:23:52,316;00:23:54,233;Varys was right.
86;00:23:54,316;00:23:56,191;I was wrong.
87;00:23:56,275;00:23:59,108;It was vanity
87;00:23:56,275;00:23:59,108;to think I could guide her.
88;00:23:59,191;00:24:01,441;Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
89;00:24:01,525;00:24:04,108;You think our house words
89;00:24:01,525;00:24:04,108;are stamped on our bodies
90;00:24:04,191;00:24:06,275;when we're born and that's who we are?
91;00:24:06,358;00:24:08,692;Then I'd be fire and blood too.
92;00:24:10,275;00:24:11,400;She's not her father,
93;00:24:11,483;00:24:13,024;no more than you're Tywin Lannister.
94;00:24:13,108;00:24:18,441;My father was an evil man.
94;00:24:13,108;00:24:18,441;My sister was an evil woman.
95;00:24:18,525;00:24:19,817;Pile up all the bodies
96;00:24:19,899;00:24:21,899;of all the people they ever killed,
97;00:24:21,983;00:24:23,441;there still won't be half as many
98;00:24:23,525;00:24:26,275;as our beautiful queen
98;00:24:23,525;00:24:26,275;slaughtered in a single day.
99;00:24:26,358;00:24:27,608;Cersei left her no choice.
100;00:24:27,692;00:24:29,066;The moment the gates fell,
101;00:24:29,149;00:24:30,191;the battle was over.
102;00:24:30,275;00:24:32,275;She saw her friend beheaded.
103;00:24:32,358;00:24:34,191;She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
104;00:24:34,275;00:24:36,108;And she burned down a city for it.
105;00:24:36,191;00:24:38,692;Ah, it's easy to judge
105;00:24:36,191;00:24:38,692;when you're standing
106;00:24:38,775;00:24:39,941;far from the battlefield.
107;00:24:40,024;00:24:41,692;Would you have done it?
108;00:24:43,275;00:24:44,525;What?
109;00:24:46,024;00:24:48,692;You've been up there,
109;00:24:46,024;00:24:48,692;on a dragon's back.
110;00:24:48,775;00:24:50,066;You've had that power.
111;00:24:50,149;00:24:51,983;Would you have burned the city down?
112;00:24:55,899;00:24:57,983;I don't know.
113;00:24:58,066;00:24:59,483;Yes, you do.
114;00:25:01,525;00:25:04,567;You won't say because
114;00:25:01,525;00:25:04,567;you don't want to betray her...
115;00:25:06,441;00:25:07,775;but you know.
116;00:25:16,108;00:25:18,316;What's it matter what I'd do?
117;00:25:18,400;00:25:21,567;It matters more than anything.
118;00:25:25,858;00:25:28,608;When she murdered
118;00:25:25,858;00:25:28,608;the slavers of Astapor,
119;00:25:29,941;00:25:32,191;I'm sure no one
119;00:25:29,941;00:25:32,191;but the slavers complained.
120;00:25:32,275;00:25:34,149;After all, they were evil men.
121;00:25:35,858;00:25:39,692;When she crucified hundreds
121;00:25:35,858;00:25:39,692;of Meereenese nobles,
122;00:25:39,775;00:25:40,733;who could argue?
123;00:25:40,817;00:25:42,316;They were evil men.
124;00:25:43,567;00:25:47,149;The Dothraki khals she burned alive?
125;00:25:47,233;00:25:49,817;They would have done worse to her.
126;00:25:51,275;00:25:55,483;Everywhere she goes, evil men die
127;00:25:55,567;00:25:57,692;and we cheer her for it.
128;00:25:59,066;00:26:00,400;And she grows more powerful
129;00:26:00,483;00:26:04,024;and more sure
129;00:26:00,483;00:26:04,024;that she is good and right.
130;00:26:09,441;00:26:10,733;She believes her destiny
131;00:26:10,817;00:26:14,108;is to build a better world
131;00:26:10,817;00:26:14,108;for everyone.
132;00:26:14,191;00:26:15,650;If you believed that...
133;00:26:17,275;00:26:18,483;if you truly believed it,
134;00:26:18,567;00:26:19,733;wouldn't you kill
135;00:26:19,817;00:26:22,567;whoever stood between you and paradise?
136;00:26:54,024;00:26:56,191;I know you love her.
137;00:27:01,441;00:27:03,358;I love her too.
138;00:27:07,024;00:27:10,692;Not as successfully as you.
139;00:27:13,358;00:27:17,858;But I believed in her
139;00:27:13,358;00:27:17,858;with all my heart.
140;00:27:25,608;00:27:29,024;Love is more powerful than reason.
141;00:27:31,692;00:27:33,775;We all know that.
142;00:27:33,858;00:27:35,567;Look at my brother.
143;00:27:40,650;00:27:42,941;Love is the death of duty.
144;00:27:48,650;00:27:50,733;You just came up with that?
145;00:27:56,149;00:27:59,567;Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.
146;00:28:04,650;00:28:09,149;Sometimes duty is the death of love.
147;00:28:14,567;00:28:18,692;You are the shield
147;00:28:14,567;00:28:18,692;that guards the realms of men.
148;00:28:18,775;00:28:21,191;And you've always tried
148;00:28:18,775;00:28:21,191;to do the right thing.
149;00:28:21,275;00:28:22,941;No matter the cost,
150;00:28:23,941;00:28:26,275;you've tried to protect people.
151;00:28:28,441;00:28:31,608;Who is the greatest threat
151;00:28:28,441;00:28:31,608;to the people now?
152;00:28:39,149;00:28:41,775;It's a terrible thing I'm asking.
153;00:28:43,149;00:28:45,191;It's also the right thing.
154;00:28:47,483;00:28:50,941;Do you think I'm the last man
154;00:28:47,483;00:28:50,941;she'll execute?
155;00:28:52,941;00:28:54,191;Who is more dangerous
156;00:28:54,275;00:28:57,650;than the rightful heir
156;00:28:54,275;00:28:57,650;to the Iron Throne?
157;00:29:10,650;00:29:13,483;That's her decision.
157;00:29:10,650;00:29:13,483;She is the queen.
158;00:29:22,233;00:29:24,191;I'm sorry it came to this.
159;00:29:36,066;00:29:37,858;And your sisters?
160;00:29:39,858;00:29:42,733;Do you see them bending the knee?
161;00:29:46,358;00:29:48,108;My sisters will be loyal to the throne.
162;00:29:48,191;00:29:51,941;Why do you think Sansa
162;00:29:48,191;00:29:51,941;told me the truth about you?
163;00:29:52,024;00:29:54,108;Because she doesn't want Dany
163;00:29:52,024;00:29:54,108;to be queen.
164;00:29:54,191;00:29:57,108;She doesn't get to choose.
164;00:29:54,191;00:29:57,108;No.
165;00:29:57,191;00:29:58,525;But you do.
166;00:30:00,149;00:30:02,024;And you have to choose now.
167;00:34:02,316;00:34:04,858;When I was a girl,
167;00:34:02,316;00:34:04,858;my brother told me it was made
168;00:34:04,941;00:34:08,441;with 1000 swords
168;00:34:04,941;00:34:08,441;from Aegon's fallen enemies.
169;00:34:11,316;00:34:13,149;What do 1000 swords look like
170;00:34:13,233;00:34:15,983;in the mind of a little girl
170;00:34:13,233;00:34:15,983;who can't count to 20?
171;00:34:17,400;00:34:21,233;I imagined a mountain of swords
171;00:34:17,400;00:34:21,233;too high to climb.
172;00:34:21,316;00:34:22,733;So many fallen enemies,
173;00:34:22,817;00:34:25,024;you could only see
173;00:34:22,817;00:34:25,024;the soles of Aegon's feet.
174;00:34:25,108;00:34:26,275;I saw them executing
175;00:34:26,358;00:34:28,275;Lannister prisoners in the street.
176;00:34:29,567;00:34:31,899;They said they were acting
176;00:34:29,567;00:34:31,899;on your orders.
177;00:34:31,983;00:34:35,191;It was necessary.
177;00:34:31,983;00:34:35,191;Necessary?
178;00:34:35,275;00:34:37,066;Have you been down there?
179;00:34:37,149;00:34:38,400;Have you seen?
180;00:34:38,483;00:34:41,233;Children, little children, burned!
181;00:34:44,024;00:34:46,650;I tried to make peace with Cersei.
182;00:34:47,983;00:34:51,525;She used their innocence
182;00:34:47,983;00:34:51,525;as a weapon against me.
183;00:34:51,608;00:34:53,400;She thought it would cripple me.
184;00:34:53,483;00:34:55,149;And Tyrion?
185;00:34:58,483;00:35:02,108;He conspired behind my back
185;00:34:58,483;00:35:02,108;with my enemies.
186;00:35:02,191;00:35:05,024;How have you treated people
186;00:35:02,191;00:35:05,024;who've done the same to you,
187;00:35:05,108;00:35:07,650;even when it broke your heart?
188;00:35:10,149;00:35:11,692;Forgive him.
189;00:35:14,024;00:35:15,733;I can't.
189;00:35:14,024;00:35:15,733;You can.
190;00:35:17,358;00:35:18,650;You can forgive all of them,
191;00:35:18,733;00:35:21,441;make them see they made a mistake.
192;00:35:21,525;00:35:23,358;Make them understand.
193;00:35:28,024;00:35:30,024;Please, Dany.
194;00:35:33,233;00:35:35,858;We can't hide behind small mercies.
195;00:35:37,191;00:35:39,233;The world we need
196;00:35:39,316;00:35:42,066;won't be built by men
196;00:35:39,316;00:35:42,066;loyal to the world we have.
197;00:35:42,149;00:35:46,149;The world we need is a world
197;00:35:42,149;00:35:46,149;of mercy. It has to be.
198;00:35:46,233;00:35:47,775;And it will be.
199;00:35:50,608;00:35:55,567;It's not easy to see something
199;00:35:50,608;00:35:55,567;that's never been before.
200;00:35:58,108;00:35:59,899;A good world.
201;00:36:00,899;00:36:02,567;How do you know?
202;00:36:04,441;00:36:06,650;How do you know it'll be good?
203;00:36:06,733;00:36:08,483;Because I know what is good.
204;00:36:09,858;00:36:11,066;And so do you.
205;00:36:11,149;00:36:13,483;I don't.
205;00:36:11,149;00:36:13,483;You do.
206;00:36:13,567;00:36:16,233;You do. You've always known.
207;00:36:19,066;00:36:20,899;What about everyone else?
208;00:36:22,733;00:36:26,066;All the other people
208;00:36:22,733;00:36:26,066;who think they know what's good.
209;00:36:28,233;00:36:30,400;They don't get to choose.
210;00:36:36,191;00:36:37,358;Be with me.
211;00:36:38,941;00:36:41,066;Build the new world with me.
212;00:36:41,149;00:36:43,525;This is our reason.
213;00:36:43,608;00:36:45,108;It has been from the beginning,
214;00:36:45,191;00:36:48,358;since you were a little boy
214;00:36:45,191;00:36:48,358;with a bastard's name
215;00:36:48,441;00:36:51,941;and I was a little girl
215;00:36:48,441;00:36:51,941;who couldn't count to 20.
216;00:36:52,775;00:36:54,608;We do it together.
217;00:36:56,733;00:36:59,858;We break the wheel together.
218;00:37:02,775;00:37:04,441;You are my queen.
219;00:37:05,817;00:37:08,692;Now, and always.
220;00:44:30,941;00:44:32,400;Where's Jon?
221;00:44:32,483;00:44:35,567;He is our prisoner.
221;00:44:32,483;00:44:35,567;So is Lord Tyrion.
222;00:44:35,650;00:44:37,899;They were both to be brought
222;00:44:35,650;00:44:37,899;to this gathering.
223;00:44:37,983;00:44:40,692;We will decide what we do
223;00:44:37,983;00:44:40,692;with our prisoners.
224;00:44:40,775;00:44:42,149;This is our city now.
225;00:44:42,233;00:44:44,650;If you look outside the walls
225;00:44:42,233;00:44:44,650;of your city,
226;00:44:44,733;00:44:46,316;you'll find thousands of Northmen
227;00:44:46,400;00:44:49,024;who will explain to you
227;00:44:46,400;00:44:49,024;why harming Jon Snow
228;00:44:49,108;00:44:50,775;is not in your interest.
229;00:44:50,858;00:44:52,817;And you will find
229;00:44:50,858;00:44:52,817;thousands of Unsullied
230;00:44:52,899;00:44:54,066;who believe that it is.
231;00:44:54,149;00:44:56,858;Some of you may be quick to forgive.
232;00:44:56,941;00:44:59,024;The Ironborn are not.
233;00:44:59,108;00:45:01,024;I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.
234;00:45:01,108;00:45:02,858;You swore to follow a tyrant.
235;00:45:02,941;00:45:04,733;She freed us from a tyrant.
236;00:45:04,817;00:45:06,275;Cersei is gone because of her,
237;00:45:06,358;00:45:08,692;and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart.
238;00:45:08,775;00:45:11,024;Let the Unsullied give him
238;00:45:08,775;00:45:11,024;what he deserves.
239;00:45:11,108;00:45:13,066;Say another word
239;00:45:11,108;00:45:13,066;about killing my brother
240;00:45:13,149;00:45:14,441;and I'll cut your throat.
241;00:45:14,525;00:45:15,941;Friends, please.
242;00:45:17,941;00:45:21,149;We've been cutting each other's
242;00:45:17,941;00:45:21,149;throats long enough.
243;00:45:21,233;00:45:24,024;Torgo Nudho.
243;00:45:21,233;00:45:24,024;Am I saying that properly?
244;00:45:27,567;00:45:29,191;If it weren't for you and your men,
245;00:45:29,275;00:45:31,692;we would've lost the war with the dead.
246;00:45:31,775;00:45:34,358;This country owes you
246;00:45:31,775;00:45:34,358;a debt it can never repay,
247;00:45:34,441;00:45:36,066;but let us try.
248;00:45:36,149;00:45:38,191;There is land in the Reach.
249;00:45:38,275;00:45:39,525;Good land.
250;00:45:39,608;00:45:42,149;The people that used to live
250;00:45:39,608;00:45:42,149;there are gone.
251;00:45:42,233;00:45:44,233;Make it your own.
251;00:45:42,233;00:45:44,233;Start your own house
252;00:45:44,316;00:45:46,775;with the Unsullied as your bannermen.
253;00:45:46,858;00:45:48,733;We've had enough war.
254;00:45:48,817;00:45:51,066;Thousands of you, thousands of them.
255;00:45:51,149;00:45:53,066;You know how it ends.
256;00:45:53,149;00:45:54,858;We need to find a better way.
257;00:45:54,941;00:45:57,400;We do not need payment.
258;00:45:57,483;00:45:58,983;We need justice.
259;00:46:00,191;00:46:01,983;Jon Snow cannot go free.
260;00:46:05,233;00:46:06,899;It's not for you to decide.
261;00:46:06,983;00:46:08,483;You are not here to speak!
262;00:46:09,733;00:46:12,066;Everyone has heard enough words
262;00:46:09,733;00:46:12,066;from you.
263;00:46:14,149;00:46:15,983;You're right.
264;00:46:16,066;00:46:18,692;And no one's any better for it.
265;00:46:20,024;00:46:22,191;But it's not for you to decide.
266;00:46:23,858;00:46:26,108;Jon committed his crime here.
267;00:46:26,191;00:46:29,692;His fate is for our king to decide.
268;00:46:29,775;00:46:31,066;Or our queen.
269;00:46:31,149;00:46:33,358;We don't have a king or queen.
270;00:46:34,692;00:46:37,692;You're the most powerful people
270;00:46:34,692;00:46:37,692;in Westeros.
271;00:46:40,066;00:46:41,692;Choose one.
272;00:46:51,316;00:46:52,858;Make your choice, then.
273;00:47:15,567;00:47:17,149;My lords and ladies...
274;00:47:20,567;00:47:25,149;I suppose this is the most
274;00:47:20,567;00:47:25,149;important moment of our lives.
275;00:47:25,233;00:47:27,483;What we decide today will reverberate
276;00:47:27,567;00:47:29,275;through the annals of history.
277;00:47:29,358;00:47:31,316;I stand before you
278;00:47:31,400;00:47:34,400;as one of the senior lords
278;00:47:31,400;00:47:34,400;in the country.
279;00:47:35,275;00:47:37,066;A veteran of two wars.
280;00:47:38,233;00:47:39,775;And I like to think my experience
281;00:47:39,858;00:47:43,692;has led to some small skill
281;00:47:39,858;00:47:43,692;in statecraft
282;00:47:43,775;00:47:45,191;and underst--
282;00:47:43,775;00:47:45,191;Uncle?
283;00:47:48,108;00:47:49,108;Please sit.
284;00:48:21,066;00:48:23,483;Well, we have to choose someone.
285;00:48:23,567;00:48:24,817;Um, ahem...
286;00:48:24,899;00:48:26,692;Why just us?
287;00:48:30,817;00:48:31,983;Um--
288;00:48:33,733;00:48:36,066;We represent all the great houses,
289;00:48:36,149;00:48:37,441;but whomever we choose,
290;00:48:37,525;00:48:40,817;they won't just rule over
290;00:48:37,525;00:48:40,817;lords and ladies.
291;00:48:40,899;00:48:44,233;Maybe the decision about
291;00:48:40,899;00:48:44,233;what's best for everyone
292;00:48:44,316;00:48:45,483;should be left to...
293;00:48:46,650;00:48:49,358;well, everyone.
294;00:49:02,858;00:49:05,775;Maybe we should give the dogs
294;00:49:02,858;00:49:05,775;a vote as well.
295;00:49:05,858;00:49:07,358;I'll ask my horse.
296;00:49:16,525;00:49:19,108;I suppose you want the crown.
297;00:49:19,191;00:49:20,608;Me?
298;00:49:21,191;00:49:22,692;The Imp?
299;00:49:24,316;00:49:26,692;Half the people hate me
299;00:49:24,316;00:49:26,692;for serving Daenerys,
300;00:49:26,775;00:49:28,899;the other half hate me
300;00:49:26,775;00:49:28,899;for betraying her.
301;00:49:30,858;00:49:34,358;Can't think of a worse choice.
301;00:49:30,858;00:49:34,358;Who, then?
302;00:49:40,858;00:49:45,066;I've had nothing to do but think
302;00:49:40,858;00:49:45,066;these past few weeks.
303;00:49:46,775;00:49:49,149;About our bloody history.
304;00:49:50,567;00:49:52,775;About the mistakes we've made.
305;00:50:03,733;00:50:06,066;What unites people?
306;00:50:08,441;00:50:09,899;Armies?
307;00:50:11,441;00:50:12,817;Gold?
308;00:50:15,108;00:50:16,899;Flags?
309;00:50:23,608;00:50:25,233;Stories.
310;00:50:27,108;00:50:29,316;There's nothing in the world
310;00:50:27,108;00:50:29,316;more powerful
311;00:50:29,400;00:50:30,608;than a good story.
312;00:50:32,941;00:50:34,608;Nothing can stop it.
313;00:50:35,941;00:50:37,817;No enemy can defeat it.
314;00:50:39,567;00:50:41,191;And who has a better story...
315;00:50:42,483;00:50:44,149;than Bran the Broken?
316;00:50:48,024;00:50:51,275;The boy who fell
316;00:50:48,024;00:50:51,275;from a high tower and lived.
317;00:50:52,775;00:50:56,858;He knew he'd never walk again,
317;00:50:52,775;00:50:56,858;so he learned to fly.
318;00:50:58,024;00:51:00,441;He crossed beyond the Wall,
319;00:51:00,525;00:51:02,024;a crippled boy,
320;00:51:02,108;00:51:04,817;and became the Three-Eyed Raven.
321;00:51:07,191;00:51:09,191;He is our memory,
322;00:51:09,275;00:51:11,941;the keeper of all our stories.
323;00:51:12,024;00:51:16,483;The wars, weddings, births,
323;00:51:12,024;00:51:16,483;massacres, famines.
324;00:51:16,567;00:51:18,483;Our triumphs,
325;00:51:18,567;00:51:21,108;mm, our defeats,
326;00:51:21,191;00:51:22,316;our past.
327;00:51:24,191;00:51:26,983;Who better to lead us into the future?
328;00:51:29,983;00:51:33,775;Bran has no interest in ruling
328;00:51:29,983;00:51:33,775;and he can't father children.
329;00:51:33,858;00:51:35,066;Good.
330;00:51:35,149;00:51:37,650;Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid,
331;00:51:37,733;00:51:39,149;as you well know.
332;00:51:40,191;00:51:42,149;His will never torment us.
333;00:51:46,233;00:51:49,525;That is the wheel
333;00:51:46,233;00:51:49,525;our queen wanted to break.
334;00:51:56,692;00:51:59,775;From now on, rulers will not be born.
335;00:51:59,858;00:52:02,692;They will be chosen on this spot
336;00:52:02,775;00:52:05,775;by the lords and ladies of Westeros...
337;00:52:05,858;00:52:08,024;to serve the realm.
338;00:52:16,066;00:52:18,066;I know you don't want it.
339;00:52:19,275;00:52:22,858;I know you don't care about power.
340;00:52:24,941;00:52:28,899;But I ask you now, if we choose you...
341;00:52:30,483;00:52:31,941;will you wear the crown?
342;00:52:33,608;00:52:36,692;Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms
342;00:52:33,608;00:52:36,692;to the best of your abilities
343;00:52:36,775;00:52:39,567;from this day until your last day?
344;00:52:45,233;00:52:48,149;Why do you think I came all this way?
345;00:52:54,733;00:52:56,899;To Brandon of House Stark...
346;00:52:58,358;00:52:59,567;I say aye.
347;00:53:11,191;00:53:12,233;Aye.
348;00:53:18,941;00:53:19,941;Aye.
349;00:53:21,233;00:53:22,191;Aye.
350;00:53:25,275;00:53:26,358;Aye.
351;00:53:29,233;00:53:30,191;Aye.
352;00:53:34,817;00:53:36,525;Aye.
353;00:53:36,608;00:53:38,191;Aye.
354;00:53:38,275;00:53:39,525;Aye.
355;00:53:39,608;00:53:41,650;Aye.
355;00:53:39,608;00:53:41,650;Aye.
356;00:53:41,733;00:53:42,692;Aye.
357;00:53:44,608;00:53:47,275;I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.
358;00:53:49,400;00:53:50,358;Aye.
359;00:54:01,525;00:54:03,817;I love you, little brother.
359;00:54:01,525;00:54:03,817;I always will.
360;00:54:03,899;00:54:05,650;You'll be a good king.
361;00:54:06,899;00:54:09,191;But tens of thousands of Northmen
362;00:54:09,275;00:54:12,066;fell in the Great War
362;00:54:09,275;00:54:12,066;defending all of Westeros.
363;00:54:12,149;00:54:14,149;And those who survived
363;00:54:12,149;00:54:14,149;have seen too much
364;00:54:14,233;00:54:17,149;and fought too hard
364;00:54:14,233;00:54:17,149;ever to kneel again.
365;00:54:19,858;00:54:23,358;The North will remain
365;00:54:19,858;00:54:23,358;an independent kingdom,
366;00:54:23,441;00:54:25,483;as it was for thousands of years.
367;00:54:50,608;00:54:53,441;All hail Bran the Broken,
368;00:54:53,525;00:54:54,650;First of His Name,
369;00:54:54,733;00:54:57,941;King of the Andals and the First Men,
370;00:54:58,024;00:55:02,733;Lord of the Six Kingdoms
370;00:54:58,024;00:55:02,733;and Protector of the Realm.
371;00:55:05,525;00:55:08,525;All hail Bran the Broken!
372;00:55:20,358;00:55:22,149;Lord Tyrion...
373;00:55:23,567;00:55:25,358;you will be my Hand.
374;00:55:25,441;00:55:27,149;N--
375;00:55:27,233;00:55:30,483;No, Your Grace, I don't want it.
376;00:55:30,567;00:55:32,650;And I don't want to be king.
377;00:55:34,733;00:55:37,024;I don't deserve it.
378;00:55:37,108;00:55:39,983;I thought I was wise, but I wasn't.
379;00:55:40,066;00:55:44,149;I thought I knew what was right,
379;00:55:40,066;00:55:44,149;but I didn't.
380;00:55:46,483;00:55:47,983;Choose Ser Davos.
381;00:55:48,066;00:55:49,441;Choose anyone else.
382;00:55:49,525;00:55:51,817;I choose you.
382;00:55:49,525;00:55:51,817;You cannot.
383;00:55:51,899;00:55:53,650;Yes, I can.
384;00:55:53,733;00:55:56,149;I'm king.
384;00:55:53,733;00:55:56,149;This man is a criminal.
385;00:55:56,233;00:55:59,525;He deserves justice.
385;00:55:56,233;00:55:59,525;He just got it.
386;00:55:59,608;00:56:02,066;He's made many terrible mistakes.
387;00:56:02,149;00:56:05,608;He's going to spend the rest
387;00:56:02,149;00:56:05,608;of his life fixing them.
388;00:56:10,358;00:56:12,024;It is not enough.
389;00:56:20,066;00:56:22,858;Giving you to the
389;00:56:20,066;00:56:22,858;Unsullied would start a war.
390;00:56:24,275;00:56:26,441;Letting you walk free
390;00:56:24,275;00:56:26,441;would start a war.
391;00:56:27,608;00:56:29,024;So our new king has chosen
392;00:56:29,108;00:56:30,858;to send you to the Night's Watch.
393;00:56:32,941;00:56:34,525;There's still a Night's Watch?
394;00:56:36,775;00:56:38,358;The world will always need a home
395;00:56:38,441;00:56:39,858;for bastards and broken men.
396;00:56:44,941;00:56:47,066;You shall take no wife,
397;00:56:47,149;00:56:49,233;hold no lands,
398;00:56:49,316;00:56:50,858;father no children.
399;00:56:53,983;00:56:56,817;The Unsullied wanted your head
399;00:56:53,983;00:56:56,817;of course,
400;00:56:56,899;00:57:00,233;but Grey Worm has accepted
400;00:56:56,899;00:57:00,233;the justice of a life sentence.
401;00:57:01,899;00:57:05,066;Sansa and Arya wanted you freed,
402;00:57:05,149;00:57:09,149;but they understand our new king
402;00:57:05,149;00:57:09,149;needs to make peace.
403;00:57:09,233;00:57:10,692;No one is very happy.
404;00:57:11,858;00:57:13,733;Which means it's a good compromise,
405;00:57:13,817;00:57:14,733;I suppose.
406;00:57:16,692;00:57:18,400;Was it right?
407;00:57:21,483;00:57:22,983;What I did?
408;00:57:25,858;00:57:27,608;What we did.
409;00:57:31,275;00:57:33,233;It doesn't feel right.
410;00:57:39,858;00:57:42,358;Ask me again in 10 years.
411;00:58:04,858;00:58:08,316;I don't expect
411;00:58:04,858;00:58:08,316;we'll ever see each other again.
412;00:58:12,316;00:58:13,733;I wouldn't be so sure.
413;00:58:14,983;00:58:16,483;A few years as Hand of the King
414;00:58:16,567;00:58:19,567;would make anyone want to
414;00:58:16,567;00:58:19,567;piss off the edge of the world.
415;01:00:38,358;01:00:41,024;I wish there had been another way.
416;01:00:42,525;01:00:44,024;Can you forgive me?
417;01:00:56,275;01:00:58,775;The North is free, thanks to you.
418;01:01:00,817;01:01:02,941;But they lost their king.
419;01:01:04,233;01:01:07,066;Ned Stark's daughter
419;01:01:04,233;01:01:07,066;will speak for them.
420;01:01:09,149;01:01:11,567;She's the best they could ask for.
421;01:01:31,525;01:01:34,567;You can come see me, you know,
421;01:01:31,525;01:01:34,567;at Castle Black.
422;01:01:35,775;01:01:37,358;I can't.
423;01:01:37,441;01:01:41,024;You think anyone will dare
423;01:01:37,441;01:01:41,024;tell you women aren't allowed?
424;01:01:46,733;01:01:48,191;I'm not going back north.
425;01:01:50,233;01:01:51,692;Where are you going?
426;01:01:53,775;01:01:55,941;What's west of Westeros?
427;01:01:58,400;01:01:59,899;I don't know.
428;01:01:59,983;01:02:01,275;No one knows.
429;01:02:02,483;01:02:04,692;It's where all the maps stop.
430;01:02:06,775;01:02:08,483;That's where I'm going.
431;01:02:17,400;01:02:18,650;You have your Needle?
432;01:02:19,983;01:02:20,983;Right here.
433;01:02:43,066;01:02:44,733;Your Grace.
434;01:02:53,608;01:02:56,316;I'm sorry I wasn't there
434;01:02:53,608;01:02:56,316;when you needed me.
435;01:02:58,358;01:03:01,275;You were exactly where
435;01:02:58,358;01:03:01,275;you were supposed to be.
436;01:07:14,941;01:07:16,608;That's not-- Uh--
437;01:07:22,108;01:07:23,191;What's this?
438;01:07:23,275;01:07:25,858;A Song of Ice and Fire.
439;01:07:25,941;01:07:27,858;Archmaester Ebrose's history
439;01:07:25,941;01:07:27,858;of the wars
440;01:07:27,941;01:07:30,191;following the death of King Robert.
441;01:07:30,275;01:07:32,483;I helped him with the title.
442;01:07:35,233;01:07:37,899;I suppose I come in
442;01:07:35,233;01:07:37,899;for some heavy criticism.
443;01:07:37,983;01:07:40,358;Oh, I wouldn't say that.
444;01:07:40,441;01:07:43,149;Oh, he's kind to me.
444;01:07:40,441;01:07:43,149;Never would've guessed.
445;01:07:47,400;01:07:48,858;He's not kind?
446;01:07:49,858;01:07:51,316;He...
446;01:07:49,858;01:07:51,316;He what?
447;01:07:52,441;01:07:54,525;What does he say about me?
448;01:07:59,858;01:08:03,483;I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem.
449;01:08:25,066;01:08:26,233;Your Grace.
449;01:08:25,066;01:08:26,233;Your Grace.
450;01:08:26,316;01:08:27,525;Your Grace.

451;01:08:46,358;01:08:49,441;We appear to be missing
451;01:08:46,358;01:08:49,441;a Master of Whisperers.
452;01:08:49,525;01:08:51,108;And a Master of Laws.
453;01:08:51,191;01:08:53,525;And a Master of War.
453;01:08:51,191;01:08:53,525;Yes, Your Grace.
454;01:08:53,608;01:08:55,567;Suitable prospects
454;01:08:53,608;01:08:55,567;will be brought to you
455;01:08:55,650;01:08:57,567;for an audience in the coming weeks.
456;01:08:58,858;01:09:01,400;And Drogon? Any word?
457;01:09:01,483;01:09:03,441;He was last spotted flying east,
457;01:09:01,483;01:09:03,441;toward--
458;01:09:03,525;01:09:05,233;The farther away, the better.
459;01:09:06,983;01:09:08,233;Perhaps I can find him.
460;01:09:09,400;01:09:10,899;Do carry on with the rest.
461;01:09:12,066;01:09:13,941;As you wish, Your Grace.
462;01:09:16,108;01:09:17,608;Ser Podrick.
463;01:09:26,233;01:09:28,899;We serve at your pleasure,

465;01:09:32,650;01:09:34,733;Long may he reign.
465;01:09:32,650;01:09:34,733;Long may he reign.
466;01:09:34,817;01:09:36,775;Long may he reign.

468;01:09:39,733;01:09:40,899;That will improve.
469;01:09:42,066;01:09:43,400;I'm sure it will.

474;01:09:57,608;01:10:01,191;would you say the crown's debt
474;01:09:57,608;01:10:01,191;to you has been paid?
475;01:10:01,275;01:10:03,066;In full, my lord Hand.
476;01:10:03,149;01:10:04,191;Good.
477;01:10:04,275;01:10:06,525;Time to start incurring a new one.
478;01:10:06,608;01:10:07,983;We have hungry people to feed.
479;01:10:08,066;01:10:09,858;Can we expect some assistance
479;01:10:08,066;01:10:09,858;in this regard?
480;01:10:09,941;01:10:11,525;Indeed we can.
481;01:10:11,608;01:10:15,149;Lord Davos, we have an armada
481;01:10:11,608;01:10:15,149;to rebuild and ports to repair.
482;01:10:15,233;01:10:17,316;We have. These projects
482;01:10:15,233;01:10:17,316;will begin as soon as
483;01:10:17,400;01:10:20,692;the Master of Coin and Lord of
483;01:10:17,400;01:10:20,692;Lofty Titles provides funding.
484;01:10:20,775;01:10:24,024;The Master of Coin looks forward
484;01:10:20,775;01:10:24,024;to helping the Master of Ships,
485;01:10:24,108;01:10:26,817;but first he has to ensure
485;01:10:24,108;01:10:26,817;we're not wasting coin,
486;01:10:26,899;01:10:28,733;or soon there won't be no more coin.
487;01:10:28,817;01:10:29,983;Any more.
488;01:10:30,066;01:10:31,525;You Master of Grammar now too?
489;01:10:31,608;01:10:33,400;Grandmaester, ahem,
490;01:10:33,483;01:10:35,692;it is my theory,
490;01:10:33,483;01:10:35,692;based on my years of work
491;01:10:35,775;01:10:37,024;on the Casterly Rock sewers,
492;01:10:37,108;01:10:39,149;that clean water
492;01:10:37,108;01:10:39,149;leads to a healthier population.
493;01:10:39,233;01:10:41,983;The Archmaester has done
493;01:10:39,233;01:10:41,983;some research on this subject
494;01:10:42,066;01:10:43,108;and it turns out--
495;01:10:43,191;01:10:45,441;The strong live and the weak don't.
496;01:10:45,525;01:10:47,441;Find the best builders
496;01:10:45,525;01:10:47,441;and set them to the task.
497;01:10:47,525;01:10:51,024;Oh, speaking of builders,
497;01:10:47,525;01:10:51,024;all the best brothels burned down.
498;01:10:51,108;01:10:53,858;The Master of Coin is willing
498;01:10:51,108;01:10:53,858;to fund reconstruction.
499;01:10:53,941;01:10:56,899;Uh... the Archmaester
499;01:10:53,941;01:10:56,899;is less than enthusiastic
500;01:10:56,983;01:10:59,233;about the salutary effects of brothels.
501;01:10:59,316;01:11:01,775;Well, I imagine he
501;01:10:59,316;01:11:01,775;isn't using them properly.
502;01:11:01,858;01:11:04,024;I think we can all agree that ships
503;01:11:04,108;01:11:05,650;take precedence over brothels.
504;01:11:05,733;01:11:08,400;I think that's a
504;01:11:05,733;01:11:08,400;very presumptuous statement.
505;01:11:09,817;01:11:11,358;I once brought a jackass
506;01:11:11,441;01:11:13,692;and a honeycomb into a brothel.
507;01:15:33,191;01:15:35,024;The Queen in the North!
508;01:15:35,108;01:15:37,024;The Queen in the North!
509;01:15:37,108;01:15:38,817;The Queen in the North!
510;01:15:38,899;01:15:40,483;The Queen in the North!
511;01:15:40,567;01:15:41,983;The Queen in the North!
512;01:15:42,066;01:15:43,775;The Queen in the North!
