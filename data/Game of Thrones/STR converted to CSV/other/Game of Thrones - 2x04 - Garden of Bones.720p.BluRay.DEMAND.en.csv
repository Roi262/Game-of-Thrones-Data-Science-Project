1;00:02:00,913;00:02:03,164;It's got to be the Mountain.
1;00:02:00,913;00:02:03,164;He's the biggest.
2;00:02:03,248;00:02:05,583;He's the strongest.
2;00:02:03,248;00:02:05,583;Bulls are bigger than lions.
3;00:02:05,667;00:02:07,460;Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.
4;00:02:07,544;00:02:10,630;If the bull had fangs and claws, I would.
5;00:02:10,714;00:02:14,383;Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime.
6;00:02:14,468;00:02:16,969;If he ever gets out.
7;00:02:17,387;00:02:18,596;Loras Tyrell?
8;00:02:18,680;00:02:21,808;Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the Queen.
9;00:02:21,892;00:02:24,644;I don't care about pretty.
9;00:02:21,892;00:02:24,644;He's better with a sword than any of them.
10;00:02:24,728;00:02:26,979;How good could he be?
11;00:02:27,064;00:02:31,234;He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years,
11;00:02:27,064;00:02:31,234;and Renly ain't dead.
12;00:02:40,744;00:02:42,870;The horses seem a little spooked to you?
13;00:02:42,955;00:02:44,497;They're horses.
14;00:02:44,957;00:02:47,166;They get spooked by their own shadows.
15;00:02:51,213;00:02:52,839;Do you hear that?
16;00:02:54,383;00:02:55,716;No.
17;00:02:56,677;00:02:58,803;There's something out there.
18;00:03:21,326;00:03:22,869;Oh.
19;00:03:23,537;00:03:25,872;Oh, you're a right little prick.
20;00:03:25,956;00:03:27,498;You should see your face.
21;00:03:27,583;00:03:29,625;I swear you pissed yourself.
22;00:03:30,002;00:03:31,711;Oh, who goes there? Ahh!
23;00:03:32,963;00:03:34,046;There is something out there.
24;00:03:34,131;00:03:36,215;Yeah, don't even try me.
25;00:03:36,800;00:03:38,801;Rennick.
25;00:03:36,800;00:03:38,801;Do you think I'm an idiot?
26;00:03:40,095;00:03:41,470;Rennick!
27;00:03:48,103;00:03:51,480;King in the North!
27;00:03:48,103;00:03:51,480;The King in the North!
28;00:04:12,336;00:04:14,378;Five Lannisters dead
28;00:04:12,336;00:04:14,378;for every one of ours.
29;00:04:14,713;00:04:16,255;They're dead.
29;00:04:14,713;00:04:16,255;Take everything they've got.
30;00:04:16,340;00:04:18,007;We've nowhere to keep
30;00:04:16,340;00:04:18,007;all these prisoners.
31;00:04:18,842;00:04:20,927;Barely enough food to feed our own.
32;00:04:21,011;00:04:22,929;We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton.
33;00:04:23,013;00:04:24,597;Of course, Your Grace.
34;00:04:24,932;00:04:27,183;The officers will be useful.
35;00:04:27,476;00:04:30,269;Some of them may be privy
35;00:04:27,476;00:04:30,269;to Tywin Lannister's plans.
36;00:04:30,354;00:04:31,354;I doubt it.
37;00:04:32,439;00:04:33,981;Well, we'll learn soon enough.
38;00:04:34,358;00:04:38,152;In my family, we say,
38;00:04:34,358;00:04:38,152;A naked man has few secrets.
39;00:04:38,236;00:04:40,029;A flayed man none.
40;00:04:40,113;00:04:42,114;My father outlawed flaying in the North.
41;00:04:42,199;00:04:45,326;We're not in the North.
41;00:04:42,199;00:04:45,326;We're not torturing them.
42;00:04:45,410;00:04:47,328;The high road's very pretty,
43;00:04:47,412;00:04:49,121;but you'll have a hard time
43;00:04:47,412;00:04:49,121;marching your army down it.
44;00:04:50,248;00:04:52,959;The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own.
45;00:04:53,251;00:04:56,087;I won't give them an excuse
45;00:04:53,251;00:04:56,087;to abuse my sisters.
46;00:04:57,172;00:04:59,632;No, don't! Don't! Please!
47;00:05:04,388;00:05:06,430;The rot's set in.
48;00:05:06,515;00:05:08,391;No, don't! No, don't!
49;00:05:09,309;00:05:11,644;Shh.
49;00:05:09,309;00:05:11,644;Please, don't!
50;00:05:11,728;00:05:13,604;It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt.
51;00:05:13,689;00:05:16,565;The rot will spread.
51;00:05:13,689;00:05:16,565;If we don't take the foot now...
52;00:05:16,692;00:05:18,442;No, you can't!
53;00:05:21,863;00:05:23,739;Ser! Please, ser.
54;00:05:23,824;00:05:25,324;I can't lose...
54;00:05:23,824;00:05:25,324;You'll die if she doesn't.
55;00:05:25,742;00:05:27,326;I don't want to be a cripple, please.
56;00:05:27,411;00:05:30,246;Surely one of our men
56;00:05:27,411;00:05:30,246;needs your attention more than this cub.
57;00:05:30,414;00:05:32,707;Your men are not my men, my lord.
58;00:05:32,791;00:05:35,334;Put this in your mouth and lie down.
58;00:05:32,791;00:05:35,334;You don't want to watch.
59;00:05:35,419;00:05:37,920;No! You can't!
59;00:05:35,419;00:05:37,920;Bite on it.
60;00:05:38,213;00:05:40,214;It's better than biting your own tongue,
60;00:05:38,213;00:05:40,214;believe me.
61;00:06:15,167;00:06:17,293;What's your name?
61;00:06:15,167;00:06:17,293;Talisa.
62;00:06:17,753;00:06:19,336;Your last name?
63;00:06:19,463;00:06:21,714;You want to know what side
63;00:06:19,463;00:06:21,714;my family fights on?
64;00:06:21,965;00:06:23,716;You know my family name.
64;00:06:21,965;00:06:23,716;You have me at a disadvantage.
65;00:06:23,800;00:06:26,427;That boy lost his foot on your orders.
66;00:06:27,846;00:06:29,013;They killed my father.
67;00:06:29,431;00:06:31,932;That boy did?
67;00:06:29,431;00:06:31,932;The family he fights for.
68;00:06:32,225;00:06:34,769;Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey?
69;00:06:35,312;00:06:37,688;He's a fisherman's son
69;00:06:35,312;00:06:37,688;that grew up near Lannisport.
70;00:06:37,773;00:06:40,816;He probably never held a spear before they
70;00:06:37,773;00:06:40,816;shoved one in his hands a few months ago.
71;00:06:40,901;00:06:42,902;I have no hatred for the lad.
72;00:06:45,030;00:06:46,322;That should help his foot grow back.
73;00:06:50,786;00:06:53,370;You'd have us surrender,
73;00:06:50,786;00:06:53,370;end all this bloodshed.
74;00:06:53,455;00:06:56,415;I understand. The country would be at peace
75;00:06:56,500;00:06:59,835;and life would be just under
75;00:06:56,500;00:06:59,835;the righteous hand of good King Joffrey.
76;00:06:59,920;00:07:02,713;You're going to kill Joffrey?
76;00:06:59,920;00:07:02,713;If the gods give me strength.
77;00:07:02,798;00:07:05,007;And then what?
77;00:07:02,798;00:07:05,007;I don't know.
78;00:07:06,259;00:07:08,260;We'll go back to Winterfell.
79;00:07:08,345;00:07:09,970;I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.
80;00:07:11,181;00:07:12,681;So who will?
81;00:07:13,016;00:07:14,642;I don't know.
82;00:07:15,352;00:07:16,936;You're fighting to overthrow a king,
83;00:07:17,020;00:07:18,395;and yet you have no plan
83;00:07:17,020;00:07:18,395;for what comes after?
84;00:07:18,814;00:07:20,856;First we have to win the war.
85;00:07:26,613;00:07:28,656;You never told me where you're from.
86;00:07:28,740;00:07:31,700;Volantis.
86;00:07:28,740;00:07:31,700;Volantis? You're far from home.
87;00:07:33,620;00:07:35,788;The boy was lucky you were here.
88;00:07:35,872;00:07:38,082;He was unlucky that you were.
89;00:07:48,135;00:07:49,844;You're here to answer
89;00:07:48,135;00:07:49,844;for your brother's latest treasons.
90;00:07:50,720;00:07:51,887;Your Grace,
91;00:07:51,972;00:07:55,141;whatever my traitor brother has done,
91;00:07:51,972;00:07:55,141;I had no part.
92;00:07:55,225;00:07:56,642;You know that. I beg you, please...
93;00:07:56,726;00:07:58,477;Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage.
94;00:07:58,562;00:08:00,229;Using some vile sorcery,
95;00:08:00,313;00:08:03,274;your brother fell on Stafford Lannister
95;00:08:00,313;00:08:03,274;with an army of wolves.
96;00:08:03,900;00:08:06,277;Thousands of good men were butchered.
97;00:08:06,361;00:08:10,531;After the slaughter,
97;00:08:06,361;00:08:10,531;the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain.
98;00:08:12,742;00:08:15,202;Killing you
98;00:08:12,742;00:08:15,202;would send your brother a message.
99;00:08:18,957;00:08:21,250;But my mother insists on keeping you alive.
100;00:08:21,668;00:08:22,918;Stand.
101;00:08:24,671;00:08:28,132;So we'll have to send
101;00:08:24,671;00:08:28,132;your brother a message some other way.
102;00:08:29,885;00:08:31,343;Meryn.
103;00:08:35,265;00:08:38,684;Leave her face. I like her pretty.
104;00:08:46,276;00:08:48,402;Meryn, my lady is overdressed.
105;00:08:49,279;00:08:50,779;Unburden her.
106;00:08:56,620;00:09:00,748;If you want Robb Stark to hear us,
106;00:08:56,620;00:09:00,748;we're going to have to speak louder.
107;00:09:02,626;00:09:04,543;What is the meaning of this?
108;00:09:13,595;00:09:15,846;What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
109;00:09:15,931;00:09:18,057;The kind who serves his king, Imp.
110;00:09:18,141;00:09:21,310;Careful, now. We don't want to get blood
110;00:09:18,141;00:09:21,310;all over your pretty white cloak.
111;00:09:21,728;00:09:24,230;Someone get the girl
111;00:09:21,728;00:09:24,230;something to cover herself with.
112;00:09:24,481;00:09:26,649;She is to be your queen.
113;00:09:26,983;00:09:28,400;Have you no regard for her honor?
114;00:09:28,485;00:09:30,736;I'm punishing her.
114;00:09:28,485;00:09:30,736;For what crimes?
115;00:09:30,820;00:09:32,988;She did not fight her brother's battle,
115;00:09:30,820;00:09:32,988;you half-wit.
116;00:09:33,073;00:09:35,824;You can't talk to me like that.
116;00:09:33,073;00:09:35,824;The king can do as he likes!
117;00:09:36,493;00:09:38,661;The Mad King did as he liked.
118;00:09:38,912;00:09:41,789;Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you
118;00:09:38,912;00:09:41,789;what happened to him?
119;00:09:41,957;00:09:44,792;No one threatens His Grace
119;00:09:41,957;00:09:44,792;in the presence of the Kingsguard.
120;00:09:45,085;00:09:48,504;I'm not threatening the king, ser.
120;00:09:45,085;00:09:48,504;I am educating my nephew.
121;00:09:48,797;00:09:51,674;Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks,
121;00:09:48,797;00:09:51,674;kill him.
122;00:09:53,260;00:09:56,053;That was a threat. See the difference?
123;00:10:18,368;00:10:21,036;I apologize for my nephew's behavior.
124;00:10:23,373;00:10:26,583;Tell me the truth.
124;00:10:23,373;00:10:26,583;Do you want an end to this engagement?
125;00:10:26,668;00:10:29,878;I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love.
126;00:10:33,883;00:10:38,220;Lady Stark, you may survive us yet.
127;00:10:43,018;00:10:44,727;The little king's backed up.
128;00:10:45,228;00:10:47,479;Clogged from balls to brains.
129;00:10:48,106;00:10:50,774;You think dipping his wick
129;00:10:48,106;00:10:50,774;will cure what ails him?
130;00:10:50,859;00:10:53,235;There's no cure for being a cunt.
131;00:10:53,903;00:10:55,988;But the boy's at that age.
132;00:10:56,072;00:10:59,658;And he's got nothing to do all day
132;00:10:56,072;00:10:59,658;but pick wings off flies.
133;00:10:59,743;00:11:02,411;Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.
134;00:11:10,170;00:11:11,879;What are you doing here, dog?
135;00:11:11,963;00:11:16,425;Your uncle left your nameday present
135;00:11:11,963;00:11:16,425;and asked me to see that you got it.
136;00:11:19,596;00:11:20,929;And?
137;00:11:21,681;00:11:23,182;What is it?
138;00:11:23,892;00:11:25,976;Look inside, Your Grace.
139;00:11:32,192;00:11:33,650;Your Grace.
140;00:11:34,778;00:11:37,613;Happy nameday, Your Grace.
140;00:11:34,778;00:11:37,613;My nameday has passed.
141;00:11:37,989;00:11:40,115;We won't tell if you won't.
142;00:11:43,912;00:11:45,120;No.
143;00:11:46,748;00:11:47,831;Her.
144;00:11:50,251;00:11:51,752;Touch her.
145;00:12:13,483;00:12:15,025;Could you hit her?
146;00:12:28,665;00:12:30,165;My uncle sent you?
147;00:12:30,792;00:12:33,669;Yes, Your Grace. He chose us himself.
148;00:12:33,962;00:12:35,295;Hmm.
149;00:12:44,597;00:12:46,181;Use this.
150;00:12:59,362;00:13:00,654;Harder.
151;00:13:05,326;00:13:08,537;I said harder.
152;00:13:11,207;00:13:14,001;He'd want me to get his money's worth.
153;00:13:56,961;00:14:00,088;Your Grace, too much pain
153;00:13:56,961;00:14:00,088;will spoil the pleasure.
154;00:14:09,516;00:14:10,766;Please, Your Grace.
155;00:14:12,894;00:14:14,520;Your Grace, if your uncle finds out...
156;00:14:14,604;00:14:16,563;Oh, I want him to find out.
157;00:14:17,232;00:14:20,400;You will bring her
157;00:14:17,232;00:14:20,400;to his chambers when you're finished
158;00:14:20,485;00:14:22,236;and show him what you've done,
159;00:14:24,280;00:14:26,448;or the same thing will happen to you.
160;00:14:32,914;00:14:34,540;Begin.
161;00:14:43,299;00:14:44,675;Harder!
162;00:14:55,979;00:14:58,981;Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger.
163;00:14:59,983;00:15:02,776;Pray I haven't kept you waiting long.
164;00:15:04,737;00:15:06,738;Your Grace.
165;00:15:09,909;00:15:13,203;Now you do the Lannisters' bidding,
165;00:15:09,909;00:15:13,203;is that it?
166;00:15:13,705;00:15:18,667;Tell me, was my brother's body even cold
166;00:15:13,705;00:15:18,667;before you secured your newest patron?
167;00:15:19,460;00:15:20,836;I'm a practical man.
168;00:15:22,714;00:15:24,506;Just not a loyal one.
169;00:15:24,591;00:15:26,258;And who would you have me be loyal to?
170;00:15:26,718;00:15:28,218;Your brother's corpse?
171;00:15:31,055;00:15:33,348;I don't like you, Lord Baelish.
172;00:15:34,309;00:15:36,393;I don't like your face.
173;00:15:36,477;00:15:39,229;I don't like the words
173;00:15:36,477;00:15:39,229;that come oozing out of your mouth.
174;00:15:40,106;00:15:43,150;I don't want you in my tent
174;00:15:40,106;00:15:43,150;one minute more than necessary.
175;00:15:43,234;00:15:45,652;So tell me, why are you here?
176;00:15:47,697;00:15:51,199;You can trust Brienne.
176;00:15:47,697;00:15:51,199;Her loyalty comes without charge.
177;00:15:54,370;00:15:56,997;You still have many friends
177;00:15:54,370;00:15:56,997;at court, Your Grace,
178;00:15:57,081;00:16:01,918;many who believe Ned Stark erred
178;00:15:57,081;00:16:01,918;by not supporting your claim.
179;00:16:03,880;00:16:05,547;Now I understand.
180;00:16:06,716;00:16:11,094;You know I have the numbers.
180;00:16:06,716;00:16:11,094;You know I'm marching on King's Landing.
181;00:16:11,929;00:16:14,890;When I take the throne,
181;00:16:11,929;00:16:14,890;you hope to retain your position.
182;00:16:16,726;00:16:18,060;And your head.
183;00:16:18,186;00:16:20,103;I would give priority to my head.
184;00:16:21,439;00:16:25,859;I understand that you don't like me,
184;00:16:21,439;00:16:25,859;and while that saddens me greatly,
185;00:16:25,985;00:16:28,487;I did not come here today
185;00:16:25,985;00:16:28,487;seeking your affection.
186;00:16:30,448;00:16:32,157;When you march on King's Landing,
187;00:16:32,241;00:16:35,369;you may find yourself facing
187;00:16:32,241;00:16:35,369;a protracted siege or...
188;00:16:37,121;00:16:38,580;open gates.
189;00:16:56,808;00:16:58,433;Your Grace.
190;00:16:58,518;00:16:59,976;Lord Baelish.
191;00:17:01,604;00:17:04,564;All of these tents look the same to me.
192;00:17:04,649;00:17:06,983;Would you be so kind...
192;00:17:04,649;00:17:06,983;It would be my pleasure.
193;00:17:07,110;00:17:09,444;It took me weeks
193;00:17:07,110;00:17:09,444;to learn my way around the camp.
194;00:17:09,529;00:17:12,948;Twice I walked in on officers
194;00:17:09,529;00:17:12,948;in stages of undress.
195;00:17:13,032;00:17:17,077;And the moment I learn which tent is mine,
195;00:17:13,032;00:17:17,077;we're on the move again.
196;00:17:17,161;00:17:18,787;Your tent?
197;00:17:18,955;00:17:20,789;Not Our tent?
198;00:17:22,041;00:17:25,961;The king snores, perhaps?
198;00:17:22,041;00:17:25,961;Or simply prefers solitude?
199;00:17:27,130;00:17:29,715;Pressures of command, no doubt.
200;00:17:29,799;00:17:32,134;Four kings vying for the throne.
201;00:17:32,635;00:17:34,386;I am not tutored in warfare,
202;00:17:34,470;00:17:38,306;but basic arithmetic
202;00:17:34,470;00:17:38,306;favors the side with the greater numbers.
203;00:17:38,474;00:17:42,310;If war were arithmetic,
203;00:17:38,474;00:17:42,310;the mathematicians would rule the world.
204;00:17:43,813;00:17:46,523;I did notice your brother
204;00:17:43,813;00:17:46,523;entering His Grace's tent just now.
205;00:17:46,607;00:17:48,734;The place of a Kingsguard
205;00:17:46,607;00:17:48,734;is by the king's side.
206;00:17:48,818;00:17:53,113;And on the night of your wedding,
206;00:17:48,818;00:17:53,113;who was by the king's side then?
207;00:17:53,531;00:17:55,574;You seem quite interested in our marriage.
208;00:17:55,700;00:17:58,243;Your marriage is quite interesting.
209;00:17:58,494;00:18:01,121;Not only to me, but to the realm.
210;00:18:01,497;00:18:06,501;The marriage of a wealthy girl
210;00:18:01,497;00:18:06,501;always breeds interest, if nothing else.
211;00:18:07,128;00:18:08,587;You've never married, have you?
212;00:18:09,547;00:18:13,008;I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly.
213;00:18:14,260;00:18:15,927;That is sad.
214;00:18:16,012;00:18:17,429;Though perhaps it's for the best.
215;00:18:17,513;00:18:19,514;The whole notion of marriage
215;00:18:17,513;00:18:19,514;seems to confuse you,
216;00:18:19,974;00:18:21,516;so allow me to explain.
217;00:18:21,726;00:18:25,103;My husband is my king,
217;00:18:21,726;00:18:25,103;and my king is my husband.
218;00:18:26,606;00:18:29,691;Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night.
219;00:19:02,600;00:19:04,351;This isn't your horse.
220;00:19:07,271;00:19:09,314;It was given to me by the Thirteen.
221;00:19:09,440;00:19:10,899;The Elders of Qarth.
222;00:19:11,275;00:19:12,275;Qarth?
223;00:19:12,652;00:19:15,862;Three days to the east, on the sea.
224;00:19:16,739;00:19:18,073;Will they let us in?
225;00:19:18,241;00:19:21,952;They said they would be honored
225;00:19:18,241;00:19:21,952;to receive the Mother of Dragons.
226;00:19:25,414;00:19:27,207;What do you know of this place?
227;00:19:27,708;00:19:31,336;Only that the desert around their walls
227;00:19:27,708;00:19:31,336;is called the Garden of Bones.
228;00:19:33,339;00:19:36,633;Every time the Qartheen
228;00:19:33,339;00:19:36,633;shut their gates on a traveler,
229;00:19:36,717;00:19:38,260;the garden grows.
230;00:19:50,731;00:19:53,567;Go on!
230;00:19:50,731;00:19:53,567;You, keep moving!
231;00:20:01,200;00:20:02,784;Bring her about!
232;00:20:02,869;00:20:05,120;What kind of fire melts stone?
233;00:20:06,873;00:20:08,331;Dragon fire.
234;00:20:08,958;00:20:10,083;There's dragons here?
235;00:20:10,418;00:20:12,711;No, all the dragons are dead.
236;00:20:13,629;00:20:14,796;What's that smell?
237;00:20:17,008;00:20:18,466;Dead people.
238;00:20:19,427;00:20:20,510;Move.
239;00:20:30,187;00:20:32,105;Please, please, no, no!
240;00:20:39,572;00:20:40,822;No.
241;00:20:51,542;00:20:52,876;He's dead.
242;00:20:55,379;00:20:56,880;He was my son.
243;00:20:59,383;00:21:01,676;My sister was three days ago.
244;00:21:03,054;00:21:05,513;My husband, the day before that.
245;00:21:06,724;00:21:09,100;They take someone every day?
246;00:21:11,354;00:21:13,021;Does anyone live?
247;00:21:36,879;00:21:38,088;Joffrey.
248;00:21:39,298;00:21:40,507;Cersei.
249;00:21:41,384;00:21:42,759;llyn Payne.
250;00:21:43,219;00:21:44,552;The Hound.
251;00:21:45,179;00:21:46,388;Joffrey.
252;00:21:47,723;00:21:48,932;Cersei.
253;00:21:50,226;00:21:51,601;llyn Payne.
254;00:21:52,103;00:21:53,436;The Hound.
255;00:21:54,146;00:21:56,231;Joffrey. Cersei.
256;00:21:57,024;00:21:58,900;llyn Payne. The Hound.
257;00:22:04,448;00:22:05,615;How dare you?
258;00:22:05,741;00:22:07,701;You may have heard false reports.
259;00:22:07,827;00:22:09,995;You betrayed Ned.
259;00:22:07,827;00:22:09,995;Betrayed?
260;00:22:10,079;00:22:11,871;I wanted him to serve
260;00:22:10,079;00:22:11,871;as Protector of the Realm.
261;00:22:11,956;00:22:13,748;I begged him to seize the moment.
262;00:22:13,833;00:22:17,210;I trusted you. My husband trusted you.
263;00:22:18,129;00:22:21,089;And you repaid our faith with treachery.
264;00:22:21,215;00:22:22,298;No, my lady.
264;00:22:21,215;00:22:22,298;Get out!
265;00:22:22,425;00:22:23,800;Cat, I've...
266;00:22:25,094;00:22:27,137;I've loved you since I was a boy.
267;00:22:28,180;00:22:31,224;It seems to me that fate
267;00:22:28,180;00:22:31,224;has given us this chance...
268;00:22:31,392;00:22:33,977;Have you lost your mind? Get out!
269;00:22:48,451;00:22:50,118;Do you want to see your girls again?
270;00:22:52,872;00:22:55,623;Sansa, more beautiful than ever?
271;00:22:56,417;00:22:59,753;And Arya, just as wild as ever?
272;00:23:01,088;00:23:02,464;You have Arya, too?
273;00:23:02,715;00:23:06,468;Both girls are healthy and safe.
274;00:23:07,803;00:23:09,054;For now.
275;00:23:09,972;00:23:12,932;But you know the Queen
275;00:23:09,972;00:23:12,932;and you know Joffrey.
276;00:23:14,226;00:23:18,146;I fear for their longevity
276;00:23:14,226;00:23:18,146;if they remain in the capital.
277;00:23:40,503;00:23:41,628;What do you want?
278;00:23:43,714;00:23:46,257;The Lannisters will trade your daughters
278;00:23:43,714;00:23:46,257;for the Kingslayer.
279;00:23:46,342;00:23:48,093;Of course they will.
280;00:23:48,177;00:23:50,553;Jaime Lannister for two girls?
281;00:23:51,180;00:23:52,889;Robb will never agree to those terms.
282;00:23:52,973;00:23:55,141;I'm not bringing these terms to him.
283;00:23:55,226;00:23:56,518;I'm bringing them to you.
284;00:23:57,019;00:23:59,270;You think I keep secrets from my son?
285;00:23:59,355;00:24:02,023;Robb has surprised them all
285;00:23:59,355;00:24:02,023;with his skills in battle,
286;00:24:02,108;00:24:03,149;but he's not a mother.
287;00:24:04,401;00:24:06,027;Consider it, Cat.
288;00:24:07,613;00:24:09,906;You may not get another chance.
289;00:24:14,370;00:24:16,830;I've brought you a gift.
289;00:24:14,370;00:24:16,830;I don't want your gifts.
290;00:24:16,914;00:24:19,707;A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill.
291;00:24:20,417;00:24:24,045;He wants you to understand
291;00:24:20,417;00:24:24,045;that this exchange of prisoners
292;00:24:24,964;00:24:26,297;is offered in good faith.
293;00:24:26,382;00:24:27,715;Good faith?
294;00:24:32,805;00:24:33,972;What's this?
295;00:25:03,752;00:25:05,795;Your husband was an honorable man.
296;00:25:07,131;00:25:10,300;He should rest beside his family
296;00:25:07,131;00:25:10,300;in the crypts beneath Winterfell.
297;00:25:15,097;00:25:17,432;You may not believe...
297;00:25:15,097;00:25:17,432;Get out.
298;00:25:50,507;00:25:52,133;Get up, you dogs!
299;00:26:03,646;00:26:05,688;That's him, the one who picks.
300;00:26:07,566;00:26:08,650;The Mountain.
301;00:26:12,029;00:26:13,404;What are you doing?
302;00:26:13,989;00:26:16,115;He told me he stares at him every day.
303;00:26:16,200;00:26:18,159;That's why he doesn't get picked.
304;00:26:43,769;00:26:44,852;You.
305;00:26:46,021;00:26:47,522;Move, boy!
306;00:26:48,274;00:26:49,357;Move!
307;00:27:09,545;00:27:11,462;Is there gold and silver
307;00:27:09,545;00:27:11,462;in the village?
308;00:27:11,547;00:27:13,464;I don't know.
308;00:27:11,547;00:27:13,464;Gems?
309;00:27:14,633;00:27:16,175;I didn't see any.
310;00:27:16,260;00:27:18,303;Where is the Brotherhood?
310;00:27:16,260;00:27:18,303;I don't know.
311;00:27:34,695;00:27:37,113;Where is the Brotherhood?
311;00:27:34,695;00:27:37,113;I don't know. Please.
312;00:27:37,698;00:27:40,116;Where is the Brotherhood?
312;00:27:37,698;00:27:40,116;I don't know.
313;00:27:46,081;00:27:47,790;Which of the villagers aided them?
314;00:27:47,958;00:27:49,584;I don't know.
314;00:27:47,958;00:27:49,584;Who?
315;00:27:50,044;00:27:51,085;I...
316;00:27:55,382;00:27:59,260;Who?
316;00:27:55,382;00:27:59,260;I never saw.
317;00:27:59,345;00:28:02,680;Please. Please, stop. Please, it's starting to...
318;00:28:02,765;00:28:05,016;Who?
318;00:28:02,765;00:28:05,016;I didn't see anyone help him.
319;00:28:06,310;00:28:08,269;Take it off! Take it off!
320;00:28:08,354;00:28:10,813;Who helped him?
320;00:28:08,354;00:28:10,813;Ganes, the butcher,
321;00:28:10,898;00:28:12,565;and his son.
321;00:28:10,898;00:28:12,565;That's better.
322;00:28:13,067;00:28:15,693;You've been very helpful.
322;00:28:13,067;00:28:15,693;No, stop, please!
323;00:28:15,986;00:28:18,279;What are you doing? Please, stop!
324;00:28:18,364;00:28:20,656;Please, stop! No! No!
325;00:28:20,991;00:28:23,117;I told you everything! No!
326;00:28:23,285;00:28:25,161;No!
327;00:28:27,331;00:28:28,581;Joffrey.
328;00:28:30,125;00:28:31,334;Cersei.
329;00:28:32,086;00:28:34,337;llyn Payne. The Hound.
330;00:28:34,588;00:28:37,006;Please, Polliver. Some food.
331;00:28:37,758;00:28:39,550;Just a crust of bread.
332;00:28:43,972;00:28:45,264;Polliver.
333;00:28:46,141;00:28:47,642;The Mountain.
334;00:29:05,619;00:29:08,413;Lady Stark, I had not thought
334;00:29:05,619;00:29:08,413;to find you in the Stormlands.
335;00:29:08,622;00:29:11,499;I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis.
336;00:29:12,459;00:29:14,961;Can that truly be you?
336;00:29:12,459;00:29:14,961;Who else might it be?
337;00:29:15,754;00:29:18,172;When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure.
338;00:29:18,799;00:29:20,758;Whose banner is that?
338;00:29:18,799;00:29:20,758;My own.
339;00:29:22,219;00:29:25,763;I suppose if we used the same one,
339;00:29:22,219;00:29:25,763;the battle would be terribly confusing.
340;00:29:26,223;00:29:28,349;Why is your stag on fire?
341;00:29:29,476;00:29:33,604;The king has taken for his sigil
341;00:29:29,476;00:29:33,604;the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.
342;00:29:33,689;00:29:37,692;Ah, you must be this fire priestess
342;00:29:33,689;00:29:37,692;we hear so much about.
343;00:29:38,527;00:29:39,902;Mmm, brother,
344;00:29:40,654;00:29:43,156;now I understand
344;00:29:40,654;00:29:43,156;why you found religion in your old age.
345;00:29:43,615;00:29:44,740;Watch yourself, Renly.
346;00:29:45,033;00:29:46,868;No, no, I'm relieved.
347;00:29:47,911;00:29:50,204;I never really believed you were a fanatic.
348;00:29:50,330;00:29:53,166;Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes,
349;00:29:53,292;00:29:55,042;but not a godly man.
350;00:29:55,419;00:29:57,837;You should kneel before your brother.
351;00:29:57,921;00:29:59,839;He's the Lord's chosen,
352;00:30:00,382;00:30:02,216;born amidst salt and smoke.
353;00:30:02,551;00:30:04,135;Born amidst salt and smoke?
354;00:30:05,345;00:30:07,722;Is he a ham?
354;00:30:05,345;00:30:07,722;That's twice I've warned you.
355;00:30:07,973;00:30:09,640;Listen to yourselves.
356;00:30:10,017;00:30:12,685;If you were sons of mine,
356;00:30:10,017;00:30:12,685;I would knock your heads together
357;00:30:12,769;00:30:16,397;and lock you in a bedchamber
357;00:30:12,769;00:30:16,397;until you remembered that you were brothers.
358;00:30:16,523;00:30:19,108;It is strange to find you
358;00:30:16,523;00:30:19,108;beside my brother, Lady Stark.
359;00:30:19,693;00:30:21,819;Your husband was a supporter of my claim.
360;00:30:22,029;00:30:23,905;Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head.
361;00:30:24,573;00:30:27,033;And you sit beside this pretender
361;00:30:24,573;00:30:27,033;and chastise me.
362;00:30:27,117;00:30:28,659;We share a common enemy.
363;00:30:28,911;00:30:31,579;The Iron Throne is mine by right.
364;00:30:32,748;00:30:34,749;All those that deny that are my foes.
365;00:30:36,585;00:30:39,337;The whole realm denies it,
365;00:30:36,585;00:30:39,337;from Dorne to the Wall.
366;00:30:39,421;00:30:41,172;Old men deny it with their death rattle
367;00:30:41,256;00:30:43,633;and unborn children deny it
367;00:30:41,256;00:30:43,633;in their mother's wombs.
368;00:30:46,345;00:30:48,179;No one wants you for their king.
369;00:30:48,639;00:30:51,140;You never wanted any friends, brother.
370;00:30:51,266;00:30:53,559;But a man without friends
370;00:30:51,266;00:30:53,559;is a man without power.
371;00:30:54,853;00:30:59,774;For the sake of the mother who bore us,
371;00:30:54,853;00:30:59,774;I will give you this one night to reconsider.
372;00:31:00,776;00:31:04,362;Strike your banners,
372;00:31:00,776;00:31:04,362;come to me before dawn,
373;00:31:05,072;00:31:08,282;and I will grant you
373;00:31:05,072;00:31:08,282;your old seat in the Council.
374;00:31:09,284;00:31:11,285;I'll even name you my heir
375;00:31:12,454;00:31:13,621;until a son is born to me.
376;00:31:15,874;00:31:17,959;Otherwise I shall destroy you.
377;00:31:22,130;00:31:23,673;Look across those fields, brother.
378;00:31:24,967;00:31:26,551;Can you see all those banners?
379;00:31:26,635;00:31:29,053;You think a few bolts of cloth
379;00:31:26,635;00:31:29,053;will make you king?
380;00:31:29,137;00:31:30,179;No.
381;00:31:31,557;00:31:34,392;The men holding those bolts of cloth
381;00:31:31,557;00:31:34,392;will make me king.
382;00:31:35,143;00:31:36,561;We shall see, Renly.
383;00:31:36,645;00:31:38,813;Come the dawn, we shall see.
384;00:31:39,314;00:31:41,482;Look to your sins, Lord Renly.
385;00:31:41,567;00:31:43,651;The night is dark and full of terrors.
386;00:31:49,658;00:31:52,660;Would you believe I loved him once?
387;00:32:13,515;00:32:15,516;I thought we were welcome.
388;00:32:15,767;00:32:18,185;If you heard a Dothraki horde
388;00:32:15,767;00:32:18,185;was approaching your city,
389;00:32:18,270;00:32:20,104;you might do the same, Khaleesi.
390;00:32:22,691;00:32:23,858;Horde?
391;00:32:39,625;00:32:41,626;My name is Daenerys...
392;00:32:41,710;00:32:44,545;Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.
393;00:32:45,297;00:32:46,756;You know me, my lord?
394;00:32:46,840;00:32:48,966;Only by reputation, Khaleesi.
395;00:32:49,384;00:32:52,428;And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant.
396;00:32:54,348;00:32:56,891;They call you the Mother of Dragons.
397;00:32:57,059;00:32:58,643;And what should I call you?
398;00:32:59,227;00:33:00,353;Oh, my name is quite long
399;00:33:00,437;00:33:03,105;and quite impossible
399;00:33:00,437;00:33:03,105;for foreigners to pronounce.
400;00:33:03,357;00:33:06,192;I am simply a trader of spices.
401;00:33:06,943;00:33:09,612;But we are the Thirteen,
402;00:33:10,322;00:33:13,616;charged with the governance
402;00:33:10,322;00:33:13,616;and protection of Qarth,
403;00:33:13,742;00:33:16,827;the greatest city that ever was or will be.
404;00:33:18,246;00:33:21,749;The beauty of Quarth is legendary...
404;00:33:18,246;00:33:21,749;Qarth.
405;00:33:24,628;00:33:25,795;Qarth.
406;00:33:26,421;00:33:28,422;Might we see the dragons?
407;00:33:33,970;00:33:36,347;My friend,
408;00:33:37,599;00:33:39,600;we have traveled very far.
409;00:33:39,851;00:33:41,894;We have no food, no water.
410;00:33:42,229;00:33:44,647;Once I see my people fed,
410;00:33:42,229;00:33:44,647;I would be honored...
411;00:33:44,773;00:33:47,108;Forgive me, Mother of Dragons,
412;00:33:47,943;00:33:50,945;but no man alive has seen a living dragon.
413;00:33:51,947;00:33:53,823;Some of my more skeptical friends
414;00:33:53,907;00:33:57,118;refuse to believe your children
415;00:33:57,828;00:33:59,203;even exist.
416;00:33:59,454;00:34:02,289;All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves.
417;00:34:03,500;00:34:04,625;I am not a liar.
418;00:34:04,710;00:34:06,752;Oh, I don't think you are.
419;00:34:06,962;00:34:08,337;But as I've never met you before,
420;00:34:08,422;00:34:11,006;my opinion on the matter is of limited value.
421;00:34:13,301;00:34:14,969;Where I come from,
422;00:34:15,971;00:34:20,975;guests are treated with respect,
422;00:34:15,971;00:34:20,975;not insulted at the gates.
423;00:34:21,059;00:34:24,353;Then perhaps you should
423;00:34:21,059;00:34:24,353;return to where you come from.
424;00:34:24,438;00:34:26,063;We wish you well.
425;00:34:29,985;00:34:31,736;What are you doing?
426;00:34:31,987;00:34:34,155;You promised to receive me.
427;00:34:35,615;00:34:36,991;We have received you.
428;00:34:37,117;00:34:39,326;Here we are, and here you are.
429;00:34:40,036;00:34:43,539;If you do not let us in, all of us will die.
430;00:34:43,749;00:34:46,000;Which we shall deeply regret.
431;00:34:46,626;00:34:49,587;But Qarth did not become
431;00:34:46,626;00:34:49,587;the greatest city that ever was or will be
432;00:34:49,671;00:34:52,923;by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.
433;00:35:00,015;00:35:02,433;Khaleesi, please be careful.
434;00:35:05,312;00:35:06,353;Thirteen!
435;00:35:08,106;00:35:13,527;When my dragons are grown,
435;00:35:08,106;00:35:13,527;we will take back what was stolen from me
436;00:35:13,695;00:35:15,821;and destroy those who have wronged me.
437;00:35:15,906;00:35:20,493;We will lay waste to armies
437;00:35:15,906;00:35:20,493;and burn cities to the ground.
438;00:35:21,369;00:35:24,914;Turn us away and we will burn you first.
439;00:35:26,416;00:35:27,792;Ah.
440;00:35:27,876;00:35:30,211;You are a true Targaryen.
441;00:35:31,630;00:35:33,255;Only, as you said a moment ago,
442;00:35:33,340;00:35:35,758;if we don't let you into the city,
442;00:35:33,340;00:35:35,758;you will all die.
443;00:35:36,510;00:35:37,551;And so...
444;00:35:37,636;00:35:42,431;Retreating in fear from a little girl
444;00:35:37,636;00:35:42,431;is unbecoming of the greatest city
445;00:35:42,516;00:35:43,974;that ever was or will be.
446;00:35:44,226;00:35:47,645;The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.
447;00:35:47,729;00:35:49,480;The Thirteen have spoken.
448;00:35:49,648;00:35:51,732;I am one of the Thirteen,
449;00:35:52,567;00:35:53,901;and I am still speaking.
450;00:35:55,111;00:35:57,238;The girl threatens
450;00:35:55,111;00:35:57,238;to burn our city to the ground
451;00:35:57,322;00:36:00,241;and you would invite her in for a cup of wine?
452;00:36:00,325;00:36:02,576;She is the Mother of Dragons.
453;00:36:02,994;00:36:07,915;Do you expect her to watch her people starve
453;00:36:02,994;00:36:07,915;without breathing fire?
454;00:36:08,291;00:36:10,709;I believe we can allow a few Dothraki
455;00:36:10,794;00:36:13,337;through our gates without dooming our city.
456;00:36:13,421;00:36:15,464;After all, here I am,
457;00:36:16,591;00:36:20,427;a savage from the Summer Isles,
457;00:36:16,591;00:36:20,427;and Qarth still stands.
458;00:36:21,137;00:36:23,013;Our decision is final.
459;00:36:23,932;00:36:25,266;Very well.
460;00:36:28,270;00:36:29,854;I invoke soumai.
461;00:36:34,734;00:36:39,947;I will vouch for her, her people,
461;00:36:34,734;00:36:39,947;and her dragons, in accordance with the law.
462;00:36:46,580;00:36:48,289;Be it on your head.
463;00:36:50,292;00:36:52,459;Welcome to Qarth, my lady.
464;00:37:42,344;00:37:43,427;You.
465;00:37:53,438;00:37:55,648;Is there gold or silver
465;00:37:53,438;00:37:55,648;in the village?
466;00:37:55,732;00:37:59,109;I'm not from the village.
466;00:37:55,732;00:37:59,109;Where is the Brotherhood?
467;00:37:59,861;00:38:00,903;I don't know what that is.
468;00:38:30,350;00:38:34,395;You two.
468;00:38:30,350;00:38:34,395;Take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.
469;00:38:34,896;00:38:36,271;What's this?
470;00:38:36,356;00:38:39,650;We weren't expecting you
470;00:38:36,356;00:38:39,650;till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.
471;00:38:40,235;00:38:41,735;Evidently not.
472;00:38:43,947;00:38:45,489;Why are these prisoners not in their cells?
473;00:38:45,573;00:38:47,908;Cells are overflowing, my lord.
474;00:38:48,326;00:38:51,120;This lot won't be here long.
474;00:38:48,326;00:38:51,120;Don't need no permanent place.
475;00:38:52,247;00:38:54,999;After we interrogate 'em, we usually just...
476;00:38:55,625;00:38:59,837;Are we so well-manned
476;00:38:55,625;00:38:59,837;that we can afford to discard
477;00:38:59,921;00:39:02,006;able young bodies and skilled laborers?
478;00:39:11,975;00:39:14,268;You, do you have a trade?
479;00:39:15,937;00:39:17,104;Smith, my lord.
480;00:39:19,190;00:39:20,941;What are you looking at? Kneel!
481;00:39:22,819;00:39:25,779;Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy.
482;00:39:26,281;00:39:28,157;He'll do no such thing.
483;00:39:29,075;00:39:31,493;This one's a girl, you idiot,
484;00:39:32,454;00:39:33,620;dressed as a boy.
485;00:39:34,247;00:39:36,457;Why?
485;00:39:34,247;00:39:36,457;Safer to travel, my lord.
486;00:39:37,375;00:39:38,542;Smart.
487;00:39:39,210;00:39:40,586;More than I can say for this lot.
488;00:39:41,171;00:39:43,630;Get these prisoners to work.
489;00:39:43,923;00:39:44,965;Bring the girl.
490;00:39:46,009;00:39:47,426;I need a new cupbearer.
491;00:39:47,761;00:39:48,969;My lord.
492;00:39:56,811;00:39:58,479;Your visits are too few, cousin.
493;00:39:58,813;00:40:00,064;Her Grace, the Queen Regent,
494;00:40:00,148;00:40:02,524;commands you to release
494;00:40:00,148;00:40:02,524;Grand Maester Pycelle.
495;00:40:02,901;00:40:04,985;Here's your warrant.
495;00:40:02,901;00:40:04,985;So it is.
496;00:40:05,987;00:40:08,155;Will you take a cup with me?
497;00:40:08,448;00:40:11,158;I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.
498;00:40:11,284;00:40:14,495;I am here at Her Grace's behest,
498;00:40:11,284;00:40:14,495;not to drink with you, Imp.
499;00:40:15,497;00:40:18,332;If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle,
500;00:40:18,416;00:40:20,000;I would have thought she'd come herself.
501;00:40:20,502;00:40:23,587;Instead she sends you.
501;00:40:20,502;00:40:23,587;What am I to make of that?
502;00:40:23,671;00:40:25,422;I don't care what you make of it,
503;00:40:25,507;00:40:28,175;so long as you release
503;00:40:25,507;00:40:28,175;your prisoner immediately.
504;00:40:28,259;00:40:32,012;And you've received
504;00:40:28,259;00:40:32,012;these instructions directly from Cersei?
505;00:40:32,472;00:40:34,306;As I said several times.
506;00:40:34,390;00:40:37,184;And you've waited this long
506;00:40:34,390;00:40:37,184;to deliver the information?
507;00:40:38,019;00:40:40,604;When the Queen Regent gives me a command,
507;00:40:38,019;00:40:40,604;I carry it out without delay.
508;00:40:44,150;00:40:46,360;Cersei must have great trust in you,
509;00:40:47,403;00:40:51,031;allowing you into her chamber
509;00:40:47,403;00:40:51,031;during the hour of the wolf.
510;00:40:56,037;00:40:58,330;The Queen Regent has
510;00:40:56,037;00:40:58,330;a great many responsibilities.
511;00:40:58,414;00:40:59,915;She often works from dusk till dawn.
512;00:40:59,999;00:41:04,211;She must be very glad to have you helping her
512;00:40:59,999;00:41:04,211;from dusk till dawn.
513;00:41:05,797;00:41:06,964;Ah.
514;00:41:07,048;00:41:08,173;Lavender oil.
515;00:41:08,258;00:41:10,676;She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl.
516;00:41:10,760;00:41:12,261;I am a knight!
517;00:41:12,971;00:41:14,930;An anointed knight, yes.
518;00:41:15,140;00:41:19,893;Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted
518;00:41:15,140;00:41:19,893;before or after she took you into her bed?
519;00:41:21,563;00:41:23,564;What? Nothing to say?
520;00:41:24,232;00:41:25,774;No more warnings for me, ser?
521;00:41:25,859;00:41:27,568;You will withdraw these filthy accusations.
522;00:41:27,652;00:41:31,238;Have you ever given any thought
522;00:41:27,652;00:41:31,238;to what King Joffrey will have to say
523;00:41:31,322;00:41:34,408;when he finds out
523;00:41:31,322;00:41:34,408;you've been bedding his mother?
524;00:41:38,705;00:41:39,997;It's not my fault!
525;00:41:40,081;00:41:42,666;Did she take you against your will?
526;00:41:43,001;00:41:44,751;Can you not defend yourself, knight?
527;00:41:44,836;00:41:48,088;Your own father, Lord Tywin,
527;00:41:44,836;00:41:48,088;when I was named the King's squire,
528;00:41:48,256;00:41:50,215;he told me to obey her in everything.
529;00:41:50,300;00:41:52,176;Did he tell you to fuck her, too?
530;00:41:52,260;00:41:55,262;I only meant I did as I was bid.
531;00:41:55,346;00:41:57,014;Hated every moment of it,
532;00:41:57,098;00:41:58,849;is that what you'll have me believe?
533;00:41:59,267;00:42:01,185;A high place in court, a knighthood,
534;00:42:01,269;00:42:03,520;my sister's legs spreading
534;00:42:01,269;00:42:03,520;open for you at night.
535;00:42:03,605;00:42:05,772;Oh, yes, it must have been terrible.
536;00:42:06,107;00:42:07,774;Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.
537;00:42:08,109;00:42:11,904;Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you.
537;00:42:08,109;00:42:11,904;Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.
538;00:42:12,238;00:42:14,573;My lord, it was your sister's bidding,
538;00:42:12,238;00:42:14,573;the Queen.
539;00:42:14,699;00:42:16,366;I'll leave the city at once, I swear.
540;00:42:16,451;00:42:19,620;No, I think not.
540;00:42:16,451;00:42:19,620;My lord?
541;00:42:20,330;00:42:21,496;You heard me.
542;00:42:25,460;00:42:28,629;My father told you to obey my sister.
542;00:42:25,460;00:42:28,629;Obey her.
543;00:42:28,755;00:42:31,381;Stay close to her side. Keep her trust.
544;00:42:31,466;00:42:33,967;Pleasure her whenever she requires.
545;00:42:34,052;00:42:38,513;No one ever need know,
545;00:42:34,052;00:42:38,513;as long as you keep faith with me.
546;00:42:40,767;00:42:42,726;I want to know what Cersei is doing,
547;00:42:43,144;00:42:47,731;where she goes, who she sees,
547;00:42:43,144;00:42:47,731;what they talk of, everything.
548;00:42:48,983;00:42:50,150;And you will tell me.
549;00:42:51,277;00:42:52,653;Yes, my lord, I will.
550;00:42:53,279;00:42:54,738;I swear it, as you command.
551;00:42:57,992;00:43:00,160;Oh, rise, rise.
552;00:43:00,995;00:43:03,622;Let us drink to our understanding.
553;00:43:03,748;00:43:06,250;Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well.
554;00:43:06,876;00:43:11,046;Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman,
554;00:43:06,876;00:43:11,046;and it's all for the good of the realm.
555;00:43:11,339;00:43:13,632;Go back and tell her
555;00:43:11,339;00:43:13,632;that I beg her forgiveness,
556;00:43:13,716;00:43:15,759;that I want no more conflict between us
557;00:43:15,843;00:43:19,471;and that, henceforth,
557;00:43:15,843;00:43:19,471;I shall do nothing without her consent.
558;00:43:19,555;00:43:20,806;But her demands?
559;00:43:21,432;00:43:23,475;Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.
560;00:43:24,227;00:43:26,186;You will?
560;00:43:24,227;00:43:26,186;Yes, I'll release him in the morning.
561;00:43:26,271;00:43:29,815;Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants,
561;00:43:26,271;00:43:29,815;but I will not have him on the Council.
562;00:43:30,191;00:43:32,734;I could swear that I had not harmed
562;00:43:30,191;00:43:32,734;a single hair on his head,
563;00:43:32,819;00:43:36,029;but that would not, strictly speaking, be true.
564;00:43:47,125;00:43:50,127;Stay within one table length.
565;00:43:55,341;00:43:56,717;Your Grace.
566;00:44:02,390;00:44:04,558;Do your knucklebones bring you luck?
567;00:44:07,437;00:44:10,731;Well, life's been good
567;00:44:07,437;00:44:10,731;since you hacked them off, Your Grace.
568;00:44:10,857;00:44:12,941;And it's four less fingernails to clean.
569;00:44:13,026;00:44:14,943;Fewer.
569;00:44:13,026;00:44:14,943;Pardon?
570;00:44:16,279;00:44:18,196;Four fewer fingernails to clean.
571;00:44:19,073;00:44:21,867;Never understood why you had to wear them.
572;00:44:22,327;00:44:25,746;It reminds me of where I come from
572;00:44:22,327;00:44:25,746;and where I am now.
573;00:44:26,247;00:44:27,789;It reminds me of yourjustice.
574;00:44:27,915;00:44:30,542;It was an honest punishment
574;00:44:27,915;00:44:30,542;and you were good with the cleaver.
575;00:44:30,626;00:44:32,919;You were a hero and a smuggler.
576;00:44:34,672;00:44:38,592;A good act does not wash out the bad,
576;00:44:34,672;00:44:38,592;nor a bad the good.
577;00:44:40,094;00:44:42,471;A lesson I've tried to teach my son.
578;00:44:42,555;00:44:44,639;Does he listen?
578;00:44:42,555;00:44:44,639;To me?
579;00:44:44,724;00:44:45,974;Gods, no.
580;00:44:47,602;00:44:49,936;But if your red woman
580;00:44:47,602;00:44:49,936;told him to leap from the crow's nest...
581;00:44:50,188;00:44:51,730;She has a name.
582;00:44:55,276;00:44:57,986;I trust you've not forgotten
582;00:44:55,276;00:44:57,986;your smuggler's tricks.
583;00:45:00,573;00:45:02,157;I've lived within the law for 17...
584;00:45:02,241;00:45:04,451;I want you to be a smuggler this time.
585;00:45:05,536;00:45:07,037;Any shore, any night.
586;00:45:07,663;00:45:08,997;What am I bringing ashore?
587;00:45:09,082;00:45:10,582;The red woman.
588;00:45:12,627;00:45:16,296;No one must know what you do
588;00:45:12,627;00:45:16,296;and we'll not speak of this again.
589;00:45:16,381;00:45:19,466;I am true to Your Grace and always will be,
590;00:45:20,468;00:45:22,677;but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.
591;00:45:23,137;00:45:25,472;Cleaner ways don't win wars.
592;00:45:55,294;00:45:57,504;Are you afraid, Onion Knight?
593;00:46:00,716;00:46:04,094;Someone once told me
593;00:46:00,716;00:46:04,094;the night is dark and full of terrors.
594;00:46:05,680;00:46:08,557;You've carried
594;00:46:05,680;00:46:08,557;more unpleasant cargo in your time.
595;00:46:12,520;00:46:15,564;Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?
596;00:46:15,690;00:46:19,025;I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady,
596;00:46:15,690;00:46:19,025;good and bad.
597;00:46:19,694;00:46:22,821;If half an onion is black with rot,
597;00:46:19,694;00:46:22,821;it's a rotten onion.
598;00:46:23,948;00:46:26,199;A man is good or he is evil.
599;00:46:26,367;00:46:28,160;And which are you?
599;00:46:26,367;00:46:28,160;Oh, good.
600;00:46:29,370;00:46:34,374;I'm a knight myself, of sorts,
600;00:46:29,370;00:46:34,374;a champion of light and life.
601;00:46:35,835;00:46:38,170;Well, that must be very nice for you.
602;00:46:54,479;00:46:57,439;Do you love your wife?
602;00:46:54,479;00:46:57,439;I do.
603;00:46:58,316;00:47:00,358;Yet you have known other women.
604;00:47:00,443;00:47:02,194;Don't talk about my wife.
605;00:47:02,278;00:47:04,946;I'm not. I'm talking about other women.
606;00:47:06,616;00:47:08,366;Like me, Ser Davos.
607;00:47:13,080;00:47:14,498;You want me.
608;00:47:15,249;00:47:17,501;You want to see what's beneath this robe.
609;00:47:20,254;00:47:21,713;And you will.
610;00:47:26,344;00:47:31,056;Strange that this Lord of Light
610;00:47:26,344;00:47:31,056;asks you to work in the shadows.
611;00:47:32,558;00:47:35,435;Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos.
612;00:47:35,770;00:47:39,606;They are servants of light, the children of fire.
613;00:47:40,608;00:47:43,944;And the brighter the flame,
613;00:47:40,608;00:47:43,944;the darker they are.
614;00:47:44,028;00:47:46,571;These weren't here before.
614;00:47:44,028;00:47:46,571;They've barred the passage.
615;00:47:48,157;00:47:50,408;They can't bar our passage.
616;00:47:55,790;00:47:57,165;Gods protect us.
617;00:47:57,625;00:47:59,876;There's only one god, Ser Davos,
618;00:48:01,254;00:48:03,547;and he only protects those who serve him.
