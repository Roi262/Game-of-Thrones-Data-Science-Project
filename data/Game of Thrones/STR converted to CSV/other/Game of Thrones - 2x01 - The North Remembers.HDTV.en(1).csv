615;00:39:31,818;00:39:34,019;we can't seem
615;00:39:31,818;00:39:34,019;to locate her.
616;00:39:34,053;00:39:36,554;If she's escaped
616;00:39:34,053;00:39:36,554;the capital,
617;00:39:36,589;00:39:38,656;Winterfell seems
617;00:39:36,589;00:39:38,656;the logical destination.
618;00:39:38,690;00:39:41,226;And yet my friends in the North
618;00:39:38,690;00:39:41,226;report no sign of her.
619;00:39:41,260;00:39:43,194;Curious.
620;00:39:43,229;00:39:45,363;If we choose to negotiate
620;00:39:43,229;00:39:45,363;with the Starks,
621;00:39:45,398;00:39:47,666;the girl has some value.
621;00:39:45,398;00:39:47,666;Whoever finds her--
622;00:39:47,700;00:39:50,235;well, you know what they say about
622;00:39:47,700;00:39:50,235;Lannisters and debts.
623;00:39:50,270;00:39:52,271;Well, you could ask
623;00:39:50,270;00:39:52,271;Varys where she is.
624;00:39:52,306;00:39:54,607;He'll have
624;00:39:52,306;00:39:54,607;an answer for you.
625;00:39:54,642;00:39:56,209;Whether you believe it...
626;00:39:56,243;00:40:00,114;Myself, I have always had
626;00:39:56,243;00:40:00,114;a hard time trusting eunuchs.
627;00:40:00,148;00:40:02,783;Who knows what they want?
627;00:40:00,148;00:40:02,783;( Chuckles )
628;00:40:02,817;00:40:05,919;A mockingbird.
629;00:40:05,954;00:40:07,713;You created your
629;00:40:05,954;00:40:07,713;own Sigil, didn't you?
630;00:40:07,738;00:40:08,938;Yes.
631;00:40:09,490;00:40:11,792;Appropriate...
631;00:40:09,490;00:40:11,792;for a self-made man
632;00:40:11,826;00:40:13,560;with so many
632;00:40:11,826;00:40:13,560;songs to sing.
633;00:40:13,594;00:40:15,228;I'm glad you like it.
634;00:40:15,263;00:40:17,131;Some people are
634;00:40:15,263;00:40:17,131;fortunate enough
635;00:40:17,165;00:40:18,798;to be born into
635;00:40:17,165;00:40:18,798;the right family.
636;00:40:18,833;00:40:21,501;Others have to find
636;00:40:18,833;00:40:21,501;their own way.
637;00:40:22,870;00:40:24,904;I heard a song once
638;00:40:24,938;00:40:27,573;about a boy
638;00:40:24,938;00:40:27,573;of modest means
639;00:40:27,607;00:40:31,343;who found his way into the
639;00:40:27,607;00:40:31,343;home of a very prominent family.
640;00:40:31,377;00:40:33,145;He loved
640;00:40:31,377;00:40:33,145;the eldest daughter.
641;00:40:33,179;00:40:36,582;Sadly, she had eyes
641;00:40:33,179;00:40:36,582;for another.
642;00:40:36,616;00:40:38,984;When boys and girls
642;00:40:36,616;00:40:38,984;live in the same home,
643;00:40:39,018;00:40:41,653;awkward situations
643;00:40:39,018;00:40:41,653;can arise.
644;00:40:41,687;00:40:44,322;Sometimes, I've heard,
644;00:40:41,687;00:40:44,322;even brothers and sisters
645;00:40:44,356;00:40:46,857;develop
645;00:40:44,356;00:40:46,857;certain affections.
646;00:40:46,892;00:40:49,326;And when these affections
646;00:40:46,892;00:40:49,326;become common knowledge,
647;00:40:49,360;00:40:53,229;well, that is an awkward
647;00:40:49,360;00:40:53,229;situation indeed,
648;00:40:53,264;00:40:55,565;especially
648;00:40:53,264;00:40:55,565;in a prominent family.
649;00:40:55,599;00:40:59,035;But prominent families
649;00:40:55,599;00:40:59,035;often forget a simple truth,
650;00:40:59,069;00:41:01,304;I've found.
651;00:41:01,338;00:41:03,473;And which truth is that?
652;00:41:03,507;00:41:07,144;Knowledge is power.
653;00:41:09,314;00:41:11,716;Seize him.
654;00:41:13,552;00:41:15,554;Cut his throat.
655;00:41:16,689;00:41:19,158;Stop. Wait.
656;00:41:19,192;00:41:21,561;I've changed my mind.
656;00:41:19,192;00:41:21,561;Let him go.
657;00:41:24,498;00:41:26,198;Step back three paces.
658;00:41:27,601;00:41:30,002;Turn around.
659;00:41:30,036;00:41:31,703;Close your eyes.
660;00:41:35,909;00:41:38,344;Power is power.
661;00:41:40,079;00:41:41,566;Do see if you can
661;00:41:40,079;00:41:41,566;take some time away from
662;00:41:41,591;00:41:43,505;your coins and your whores
663;00:41:43,850;00:41:45,651;to locate
663;00:41:43,850;00:41:45,651;the Stark girl for me.
664;00:41:45,685;00:41:49,221;I would very much
664;00:41:45,685;00:41:49,221;appreciate it.
665;00:41:59,032;00:42:01,233;Robb:
665;00:41:59,032;00:42:01,233;You're Ser Alton Lannister?
666;00:42:01,267;00:42:03,836;I am, Your Grace.
667;00:42:03,870;00:42:07,407;I offer your cousins peace
667;00:42:03,870;00:42:07,407;if they meet my terms.
668;00:42:07,441;00:42:11,744;First, your family
668;00:42:07,441;00:42:11,744;must release my sisters.
669;00:42:11,779;00:42:15,447;Second, my father's bones
669;00:42:11,779;00:42:15,447;must be returned to us
670;00:42:15,481;00:42:17,415;so he may rest beside
670;00:42:15,481;00:42:17,415;his brother and sister
671;00:42:17,450;00:42:20,185;in the crypts
671;00:42:17,450;00:42:20,185;beneath Winterfell.
672;00:42:20,219;00:42:22,388;And the remains of all those
672;00:42:20,219;00:42:22,388;who died in his service
673;00:42:22,422;00:42:24,623;must also be returned.
674;00:42:24,658;00:42:27,160;Their families can honor
674;00:42:24,658;00:42:27,160;them with proper funerals.
675;00:42:27,195;00:42:30,263;An honorable request, Your Grace.
675;00:42:27,195;00:42:30,263;Third...
676;00:42:31,933;00:42:34,402;Joffrey and the Queen Regent
676;00:42:31,933;00:42:34,402;must renounce all claim
677;00:42:34,436;00:42:37,038;to dominion of the North.
678;00:42:37,073;00:42:39,274;From this time
678;00:42:37,073;00:42:39,274;till the end of time,
679;00:42:39,309;00:42:41,843;we are a free
679;00:42:39,309;00:42:41,843;and independent kingdom.
680;00:42:41,878;00:42:43,845;The King in the North.
681;00:42:43,880;00:42:46,347;All:
681;00:42:43,880;00:42:46,347;King in the North.
682;00:42:46,382;00:42:47,949;Neither Joffrey
682;00:42:46,382;00:42:47,949;nor any of his men
683;00:42:47,984;00:42:50,218;shall set foot
683;00:42:47,984;00:42:50,218;in our lands again.
684;00:42:50,286;00:42:52,153;If he disregards
684;00:42:50,286;00:42:52,153;this command,
685;00:42:52,188;00:42:55,724;he shall suffer
685;00:42:52,188;00:42:55,724;the same fate as my father,
686;00:42:55,758;00:43:00,061;only I don't need a servant
686;00:42:55,758;00:43:00,061;to do my beheading for me.
687;00:43:00,095;00:43:03,598;These are-- Your Grace,
687;00:43:00,095;00:43:03,598;these are--
688;00:43:03,632;00:43:06,167;these are my terms.
689;00:43:06,201;00:43:09,337;If the Queen Regent and her son
689;00:43:06,201;00:43:09,337;meet them, I'll give them peace.
690;00:43:09,371;00:43:12,340;If not...
691;00:43:12,374;00:43:14,809;I will litter the south
691;00:43:12,374;00:43:14,809;with Lannister dead.
692;00:43:14,844;00:43:17,746;King Joffrey is a Baratheon,
692;00:43:14,844;00:43:17,746;Your Grace.
693;00:43:17,780;00:43:19,581;Oh, is he?
694;00:43:20,784;00:43:24,119;You'll ride at daybreak,
694;00:43:20,784;00:43:24,119;Ser Alton.
695;00:43:24,154;00:43:26,788;That will be all
695;00:43:24,154;00:43:26,788;for tonight.
696;00:43:41,537;00:43:43,672;A word, Your Grace?
697;00:43:45,441;00:43:48,176;You don't have to call me
697;00:43:45,441;00:43:48,176;Your Grace when no one's around.
698;00:43:48,210;00:43:50,913;It's not so bad
698;00:43:48,210;00:43:50,913;once you get used to it.
699;00:43:50,947;00:43:52,781;I'm glad someone's
699;00:43:50,947;00:43:52,781;gotten used to it.
700;00:43:52,815;00:43:56,151;The Lannisters are going to reject
700;00:43:52,815;00:43:56,151;your terms, you know?
701;00:43:56,185;00:43:57,886;Of course they are.
702;00:43:57,920;00:44:00,255;We can fight them
702;00:43:57,920;00:44:00,255;in the fields as long as you like,
703;00:44:00,289;00:44:03,992;but we won't beat them until you
703;00:44:00,289;00:44:03,992;take King's Landing.
704;00:44:05,528;00:44:08,664;And we can't take
704;00:44:05,528;00:44:08,664;King's Landing without ships.
705;00:44:08,698;00:44:11,333;My father has ships and men
705;00:44:08,698;00:44:11,333;who know how to sail them.
706;00:44:11,368;00:44:13,135;Men who fought
706;00:44:11,368;00:44:13,135;my father.
707;00:44:13,170;00:44:15,604;Men who fought King Robert
707;00:44:13,170;00:44:15,604;to free themselves
708;00:44:15,638;00:44:19,442;from the yoke of the South,
708;00:44:15,638;00:44:19,442;just like you're doing now.
709;00:44:20,610;00:44:23,680;I'm his only living son.
710;00:44:23,714;00:44:26,850;He'll listen to me.
710;00:44:23,714;00:44:26,850;I know he will.
711;00:44:29,286;00:44:32,555;I'm not a Stark.
711;00:44:29,286;00:44:32,555;I know that.
712;00:44:32,590;00:44:35,559;But your father raised me
712;00:44:32,590;00:44:35,559;to be an honorable man.
713;00:44:37,328;00:44:39,830;We can avenge him
713;00:44:37,328;00:44:39,830;together.
714;00:44:41,132;00:44:44,101;You don't want
714;00:44:41,132;00:44:44,101;Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
715;00:44:44,135;00:44:46,403;I need his ships.
715;00:44:44,135;00:44:46,403;They say he has 200.
716;00:44:46,438;00:44:50,007;They say a million rats
716;00:44:46,438;00:44:50,007;live in the sewers of King's Landing.
717;00:44:50,041;00:44:51,976;Shall we rally them
717;00:44:50,041;00:44:51,976;to fight for us?
718;00:44:52,010;00:44:53,844;I understand you don't
718;00:44:52,010;00:44:53,844;trust Lord Greyjoy.
719;00:44:53,879;00:44:58,549;I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because
719;00:44:53,879;00:44:58,549;he is not trustworthy.
720;00:44:58,583;00:45:01,218;Your father had to go to war
720;00:44:58,583;00:45:01,218;to end his rebellion.
721;00:45:01,253;00:45:05,123;Yes. And now I'm the one
721;00:45:01,253;00:45:05,123;rebelling against the throne.
722;00:45:05,157;00:45:07,425;Before me, it was father.
723;00:45:07,459;00:45:09,126;You married one rebel
723;00:45:07,459;00:45:09,126;and mothered another.
724;00:45:09,160;00:45:12,163;I mothered more than
724;00:45:09,160;00:45:12,163;just rebels,
725;00:45:12,197;00:45:14,531;a fact you seem
725;00:45:12,197;00:45:14,531;to have forgotten.
726;00:45:14,566;00:45:16,567;If I trade the Kingslayer
726;00:45:14,566;00:45:16,567;for two girls,
727;00:45:16,601;00:45:18,868;my bannermen will string me up
727;00:45:16,601;00:45:18,868;by my feet.
728;00:45:18,903;00:45:22,072;You want to leave Sansa
728;00:45:18,903;00:45:22,072;in the Queen's hands?
729;00:45:22,106;00:45:24,174;And Arya--
730;00:45:24,208;00:45:27,210;I haven't heard
730;00:45:24,208;00:45:27,210;a word about Arya.
731;00:45:27,245;00:45:28,979;What are we fighting for
731;00:45:27,245;00:45:28,979;if not for them?
732;00:45:29,013;00:45:30,614;It's more complicated
