1;00:02:12,257;00:02:13,591;That's it.
2;00:03:28,750;00:03:30,751;The tide's against us.
3;00:03:30,836;00:03:32,169;Aye, but we have the wind.
4;00:03:32,671;00:03:35,381;She'll blow us straight to the gates.
5;00:03:35,465;00:03:36,549;You're coming home.
6;00:03:36,633;00:03:39,552;King's Landing hasn't been home
6;00:03:36,633;00:03:39,552;for 20 years.
7;00:03:41,013;00:03:44,765;I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet.
8;00:03:46,894;00:03:49,186;And now I'm sailing right at them.
9;00:03:49,479;00:03:51,439;This is the royal fleet.
10;00:03:51,690;00:03:53,441;And you're not a smuggler anymore,
10;00:03:51,690;00:03:53,441;you're the high captain.
11;00:03:53,525;00:03:56,694;Of course, there are...
11;00:03:53,525;00:03:56,694;several royal fleets at the moment.
12;00:03:56,778;00:03:57,820;Not after tonight.
13;00:03:58,780;00:04:01,616;When the sun rises,
13;00:03:58,780;00:04:01,616;Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne
14;00:04:01,700;00:04:03,159;and you will be his Hand.
15;00:04:03,243;00:04:04,994;Gods be good.
15;00:04:03,243;00:04:04,994;God.
16;00:04:05,454;00:04:07,246;Father, there is only one
16;00:04:05,454;00:04:07,246;and he watches over us.
17;00:04:07,331;00:04:09,498;But not over them?
17;00:04:07,331;00:04:09,498;Over all of us.
18;00:04:10,208;00:04:13,544;The people of King's Landing did not
18;00:04:10,208;00:04:13,544;choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon.
19;00:04:14,504;00:04:16,047;They will be glad to see his head on a spike.
20;00:04:16,340;00:04:18,799;Well, first, we have to put it there.
21;00:04:19,468;00:04:21,719;Our ships outnumber theirs 10-to-1.
22;00:04:21,803;00:04:23,471;Our army outnumber theirs 5-to-1.
23;00:04:24,222;00:04:25,765;Those walls have never been breached,
24;00:04:26,642;00:04:27,975;and the men guarding the walls,
25;00:04:28,060;00:04:31,187;when they see you, they don't see a liberator,
26;00:04:31,271;00:04:34,273;they see a stranger come
26;00:04:31,271;00:04:34,273;to set their city on fire.
27;00:04:35,025;00:04:37,109;I have faith in the Lord of Light.
28;00:04:37,194;00:04:39,236;I have faith in our cause.
29;00:04:40,781;00:04:42,031;And I have faith in my captain.
30;00:05:17,109;00:05:19,068;Are you afraid, my lion?
31;00:05:23,824;00:05:27,827;If the city falls, Stannis will
31;00:05:23,824;00:05:27,827;burn every Lannister he can find.
32;00:05:30,247;00:05:32,081;Of course I'm afraid.
33;00:05:35,127;00:05:37,169;I won't let them hurt you.
34;00:05:41,883;00:05:43,467;I'm a Lannister.
35;00:05:43,844;00:05:46,262;I don't have a choice in all this.
36;00:05:47,723;00:05:49,598;But it's not your war.
37;00:05:56,064;00:05:57,273;It is now.
38;00:06:02,362;00:06:04,488;You can't fuck your way out of everything.
39;00:06:06,408;00:06:07,658;I have so far.
40;00:06:11,288;00:06:13,956;Do you remember what you said
40;00:06:11,288;00:06:13,956;when you met me in your tent?
41;00:06:16,126;00:06:20,171;That I should make love to you
41;00:06:16,126;00:06:20,171;like it was your last day on this earth.
42;00:06:32,976;00:06:34,643;As you know, Your Grace,
43;00:06:34,728;00:06:37,563;it is not only the sworn duty of a maester
44;00:06:37,647;00:06:40,691;to carry out the wishes
44;00:06:37,647;00:06:40,691;of the house he serves,
45;00:06:40,776;00:06:43,527;but also to offer guidance
46;00:06:43,612;00:06:46,781;and counsel in times of war.
47;00:06:46,865;00:06:49,408;Your words are always wise and measured.
48;00:06:49,493;00:06:51,911;If you could...
48;00:06:49,493;00:06:51,911;If anything,
49;00:06:51,995;00:06:55,915;a maester's duties become more urgent
50;00:06:55,999;00:06:59,335;in times of war and turmoil.
51;00:07:00,712;00:07:03,756;I remember back in the days of King...
52;00:07:03,840;00:07:05,382;You brought me something?
53;00:07:06,426;00:07:07,426;Yes.
54;00:07:11,431;00:07:13,224;Essence of nightshade
55;00:07:13,892;00:07:17,311;is as dangerous as it is efficacious.
56;00:07:18,563;00:07:20,856;A single drop in a cup of wine
57;00:07:21,525;00:07:24,693;suffices to soothe ragged nerves.
58;00:07:25,278;00:07:29,490;Three drops will bring on
58;00:07:25,278;00:07:29,490;a deep and dreamless sleep.
59;00:07:31,243;00:07:32,618;Ten drops, however...
60;00:07:32,702;00:07:34,453;I know what ten drops will bring.
61;00:07:34,538;00:07:36,914;Your Grace, if I may ask...
62;00:07:36,998;00:07:38,374;You may not.
63;00:07:40,710;00:07:42,920;You must have a lot of work to do.
64;00:07:43,004;00:07:45,548;I'm sure many brave men
64;00:07:43,004;00:07:45,548;will need your wisdom soon.
65;00:07:47,342;00:07:50,302;Yes. A siege is very...
66;00:07:50,387;00:07:52,555;Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester.
66;00:07:50,387;00:07:52,555;There are so many.
67;00:07:56,101;00:07:57,518;Your Grace.
68;00:08:00,897;00:08:02,982;And so he spoke
69;00:08:03,483;00:08:08,070;That Lord of Castamere
70;00:08:08,155;00:08:13,075;But now the rains weep o'er his halls
71;00:08:13,160;00:08:17,496;With no one there to hear
72;00:08:17,622;00:08:22,710;Yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls
73;00:08:22,794;00:08:28,340;And not a soul to hear
74;00:08:28,425;00:08:32,261;Good boys!
74;00:08:28,425;00:08:32,261;Lannisters!
75;00:08:32,345;00:08:34,180;Where'd you learn the Lannister song?
76;00:08:34,264;00:08:35,931;Drunk Lannisters.
77;00:08:38,268;00:08:39,894;You've got a pretty voice.
78;00:08:39,978;00:08:41,896;Thank you very much.
79;00:08:41,980;00:08:43,230;And I like your nose.
80;00:08:44,357;00:08:45,941;How many times you break it?
81;00:08:47,736;00:08:49,570;Well, now let's see.
82;00:08:50,739;00:08:52,990;First time, I was five.
83;00:08:53,783;00:08:56,368;My mam smacked me with an iron poker.
83;00:08:53,783;00:08:56,368;Oh.
84;00:08:56,953;00:08:59,371;It wasn't me she was aiming at.
85;00:08:59,456;00:09:01,332;She was trying for my little brother.
86;00:09:01,416;00:09:02,708;Now he was a real pest.
87;00:09:03,001;00:09:05,961;Second time, I was nine.
88;00:09:07,172;00:09:09,798;Got in a scrap with a few older boys.
89;00:09:10,217;00:09:11,467;They won.
90;00:09:12,510;00:09:13,510;Third time...
91;00:09:22,062;00:09:25,022;Eh, you don't want to know
91;00:09:22,062;00:09:25,022;about the third time.
92;00:09:27,817;00:09:29,151;Poor nose.
93;00:09:30,111;00:09:31,779;Don't feel sorry for him.
94;00:09:31,863;00:09:34,698;He'll be halfway up your arse
94;00:09:31,863;00:09:34,698;before the night's through.
95;00:09:46,044;00:09:47,336;Welcome, friends.
96;00:09:51,716;00:09:53,050;This round's on me.
97;00:10:03,019;00:10:04,478;I don't think he likes me.
98;00:10:18,243;00:10:19,576;You think you're a hard man?
99;00:10:21,830;00:10:23,163;I know it.
100;00:10:28,586;00:10:30,254;It's warm in here.
101;00:10:30,964;00:10:32,798;We've got beautiful women
102;00:10:32,882;00:10:34,216;and good brown ale.
103;00:10:34,968;00:10:36,719;Plenty for everyone.
104;00:10:37,679;00:10:38,929;And all you want
105;00:10:39,014;00:10:41,640;is to put one of us in the cold ground
106;00:10:42,475;00:10:44,518;with no women to keep us company.
107;00:10:44,602;00:10:46,937;Oh, there's women in the ground.
108;00:10:47,022;00:10:48,981;I put some there myself.
109;00:10:49,816;00:10:51,233;So have you.
110;00:10:53,028;00:10:55,195;You like fucking and drinking
111;00:10:55,572;00:10:56,989;and singing.
112;00:10:59,284;00:11:00,701;But killing,
113;00:11:01,911;00:11:04,121;killing's the thing you love.
114;00:11:05,415;00:11:07,207;You're just like me.
115;00:11:10,587;00:11:12,087;Only smaller.
116;00:11:14,758;00:11:16,175;And quicker.
117;00:11:16,593;00:11:18,427;Eh?
118;00:11:20,722;00:11:23,223;Your Lord Imp's going to miss you.
119;00:11:29,773;00:11:31,190;Aye...
120;00:11:33,777;00:11:35,819;I expect he will someday.
121;00:11:41,242;00:11:42,659;Here we are.
122;00:11:54,923;00:11:56,507;One more drink before the war?
123;00:11:57,175;00:11:58,550;Shall we?
124;00:12:09,896;00:12:12,231;I've always hated the bells.
125;00:12:12,315;00:12:14,024;They ring for horror.
126;00:12:14,109;00:12:16,735;A dead king, a city under siege.
127;00:12:16,820;00:12:18,570;A wedding.
127;00:12:16,820;00:12:18,570;Exactly.
128;00:12:21,199;00:12:22,950;Podrick, is that it?
129;00:12:23,034;00:12:25,244;Is that it? Nice touch.
130;00:12:26,037;00:12:28,705;As if you don't know the name
130;00:12:26,037;00:12:28,705;of every boy in town.
131;00:12:29,040;00:12:31,583;I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.
132;00:12:31,668;00:12:34,878;I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure
132;00:12:31,668;00:12:34,878;what I'm suggesting.
133;00:12:35,755;00:12:37,297;Do you trust him?
134;00:12:41,052;00:12:42,511;Oddly enough, I do.
135;00:12:44,264;00:12:45,347;Good.
136;00:12:51,187;00:12:52,896;The map you asked for.
137;00:12:57,569;00:13:00,112;There must be 20 miles of tunnels
137;00:12:57,569;00:13:00,112;beneath the city.
138;00:13:00,196;00:13:01,822;Closer to 50.
139;00:13:01,906;00:13:05,451;The Targaryens built this city
139;00:13:01,906;00:13:05,451;to withstand a siege
140;00:13:05,535;00:13:08,871;and to provide escape if necessary.
141;00:13:09,372;00:13:10,998;I'm not escaping.
142;00:13:11,458;00:13:13,250;Strange as it sounds,
142;00:13:11,458;00:13:13,250;I'm the captain of the ship,
143;00:13:13,334;00:13:14,877;and if the ship goes down, I go with her.
144;00:13:15,253;00:13:16,920;That is good to hear.
145;00:13:17,005;00:13:21,341;Though I'm sure many captains say the same
145;00:13:17,005;00:13:21,341;while their ship is afloat.
146;00:13:22,635;00:13:25,053;You look well suited for battle, my lord.
147;00:13:25,138;00:13:26,597;Well, I'm not.
148;00:13:27,140;00:13:29,516;For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong.
149;00:13:31,060;00:13:32,519;My little birds tell me
150;00:13:32,604;00:13:36,899;that Stannis Baratheon has taken up
150;00:13:32,604;00:13:36,899;with a red priestess from Asshai.
151;00:13:37,275;00:13:38,817;What of it?
152;00:13:38,902;00:13:42,196;You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?
153;00:13:42,280;00:13:45,407;Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting.
153;00:13:42,280;00:13:45,407;What do you think?
154;00:13:46,409;00:13:49,036;I think you believe in what you see
155;00:13:50,246;00:13:52,581;and in what those you trust have seen.
156;00:13:54,292;00:13:56,919;You probably don't entirely trust me.
157;00:13:57,545;00:13:59,046;Mmm, don't take it personally.
158;00:13:59,130;00:14:00,672;I don't entirely trust myself.
159;00:14:01,549;00:14:03,550;And yet I have seen things
160;00:14:04,427;00:14:06,053;and heard things,
161;00:14:06,429;00:14:09,932;things you have not, things I wish I had not.
162;00:14:13,811;00:14:16,480;I don't believe I've ever told you
162;00:14:13,811;00:14:16,480;how I was cut.
163;00:14:18,691;00:14:20,108;No, I don't believe you have.
164;00:14:22,278;00:14:23,946;One day, I will.
165;00:14:26,157;00:14:29,910;The dark arts have
165;00:14:26,157;00:14:29,910;provided Lord Stannis with his armies
166;00:14:29,994;00:14:32,371;and paved his path to our door.
167;00:14:33,456;00:14:37,543;For a man in service to such powers
167;00:14:33,456;00:14:37,543;to sit on the Iron Throne,
168;00:14:37,627;00:14:39,836;I can think of nothing worse.
169;00:14:40,922;00:14:42,422;And tonight,
170;00:14:42,507;00:14:46,260;I believe you are the only man
170;00:14:42,507;00:14:46,260;who can stop him.
171;00:15:13,246;00:15:15,414;They're welcoming the new king.
172;00:15:15,498;00:15:17,708;I've never known bells to mean surrender.
173;00:15:19,377;00:15:21,253;They want to play music with us? Let's play.
174;00:15:21,337;00:15:24,089;Drums.
174;00:15:21,337;00:15:24,089;Drums!
175;00:15:49,907;00:15:51,283;Remember, wait till the ships...
176;00:15:51,367;00:15:52,534;The ships are in the bay.
177;00:15:52,619;00:15:55,787;They must be far enough in...
177;00:15:52,619;00:15:55,787;I know what in means.
178;00:15:55,872;00:15:58,081;Do you know how to use that?
178;00:15:55,872;00:15:58,081;I chopped wood once.
179;00:15:58,666;00:16:00,626;No, I watched my brother chopping wood.
180;00:16:00,710;00:16:02,586;I saw you kill a man with a shield.
181;00:16:02,670;00:16:04,212;You'll be unstoppable with an ax.
182;00:16:06,257;00:16:08,342;Don't get killed.
182;00:16:06,257;00:16:08,342;Nor you, my friend.
183;00:16:08,426;00:16:11,386;Oh, are we friends now?
183;00:16:08,426;00:16:11,386;Of course we are.
184;00:16:11,804;00:16:15,098;Just because I pay you for your services
184;00:16:11,804;00:16:15,098;doesn't diminish our friendship.
185;00:16:15,183;00:16:16,308;Enhances it, really.
186;00:16:16,726;00:16:18,977;Oh! Enhances.  Fancy word for a sellsword.
187;00:16:19,312;00:16:21,855;Been spending time with fancy folks.
188;00:16:32,909;00:16:36,078;Lady Sansa and Sheila.
189;00:16:37,121;00:16:39,247;Shae.
189;00:16:37,121;00:16:39,247;Shae, yes.
190;00:16:39,832;00:16:43,460;Surely my sister has asked you to join the
190;00:16:39,832;00:16:43,460;other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast.
191;00:16:43,544;00:16:46,922;She has, my lord,
191;00:16:43,544;00:16:46,922;but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off.
192;00:16:48,341;00:16:49,383;Sansa.
193;00:16:49,467;00:16:51,218;Always been a great romantic, my nephew.
194;00:16:51,552;00:16:52,928;Sansa, come here.
195;00:16:55,723;00:16:57,766;I will pray for your safe return, my lord.
196;00:16:58,893;00:17:01,687;Will you?
196;00:16:58,893;00:17:01,687;Just as I pray for the king's.
197;00:17:06,734;00:17:07,943;Stay safe, my lady.
198;00:17:08,027;00:17:09,653;And you, my lion.
199;00:17:15,410;00:17:17,744;Your king rides forth to battle.
200;00:17:18,496;00:17:20,872;You should see him off with a kiss.
201;00:17:21,749;00:17:23,041;My new blade.
202;00:17:23,292;00:17:24,793;Hearteater, I've named it.
203;00:17:27,547;00:17:28,839;Kiss it.
204;00:17:38,891;00:17:40,600;You'll kiss it again when I return
205;00:17:40,685;00:17:42,477;and taste my uncle's blood.
206;00:17:42,603;00:17:44,187;Will you slay him yourself?
207;00:17:44,897;00:17:47,816;If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.
208;00:17:48,151;00:17:50,819;So you'll be outside the gates
208;00:17:48,151;00:17:50,819;fighting in the vanguard?
209;00:17:51,946;00:17:55,866;A king doesn't discuss battle plans
209;00:17:51,946;00:17:55,866;with stupid girls.
210;00:17:56,367;00:17:59,161;I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid.
211;00:17:59,245;00:18:01,747;Of course you'll be in the vanguard.
212;00:18:01,831;00:18:04,958;They say my brother Robb always goes
212;00:18:01,831;00:18:04,958;where the fighting is thickest.
213;00:18:05,209;00:18:06,835;And he is only a pretender.
214;00:18:06,919;00:18:08,503;Your brother's turn will come.
215;00:18:09,505;00:18:12,591;Then you can lick his blood
215;00:18:09,505;00:18:12,591;off Hearteater, too.
216;00:18:24,812;00:18:27,814;Some of those boys will never come back.
217;00:18:27,899;00:18:29,357;Joffrey will.
218;00:18:29,859;00:18:31,985;The worst ones always live.
218;00:18:29,859;00:18:31,985;Shh.
219;00:18:33,237;00:18:34,738;Come, my lady.
220;00:19:21,702;00:19:23,537;Where's our fleet?
221;00:19:23,621;00:19:24,621;On the way.
222;00:19:25,748;00:19:27,666;Why isn't it here now? They're coming.
223;00:19:29,752;00:19:33,421;Hound, tell the Hand
223;00:19:29,752;00:19:33,421;that his king has asked him a question.
224;00:19:33,506;00:19:35,257;The king has asked you a question.
225;00:19:35,800;00:19:39,845;Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king
225;00:19:35,800;00:19:39,845;that the Hand is extremely busy.
226;00:19:39,929;00:19:42,848;The Hand of the King would like me
226;00:19:39,929;00:19:42,848;to tell you to tell the king...
227;00:19:42,932;00:19:46,017;If I tell the Hound to cut you in half,
227;00:19:42,932;00:19:46,017;he'll do it without a second thought.
228;00:19:46,102;00:19:48,061;That would make me the quarterman.
229;00:19:48,145;00:19:50,105;It just doesn't have the same ring to it.
230;00:19:51,274;00:19:54,234;Cut me in half and I won't be
230;00:19:51,274;00:19:54,234;able to give the signal.
231;00:19:54,318;00:19:55,569;No signal, no plan.
232;00:19:55,653;00:19:59,155;No plan and Stannis Baratheon
232;00:19:55,653;00:19:59,155;sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne,
233;00:19:59,740;00:20:02,158;puts your pinched little head
233;00:19:59,740;00:20:02,158;atop a gate somewhere.
234;00:20:02,952;00:20:04,828;It might be quite amusing,
235;00:20:04,912;00:20:06,496;except that my head would be up there, too.
236;00:20:06,914;00:20:08,623;I've never much liked my head,
237;00:20:08,708;00:20:11,626;but I don't want to see it removed just yet.
238;00:20:14,672;00:20:16,214;Where are their ships?
239;00:20:16,299;00:20:18,925;It was wise to attack at night.
239;00:20:16,299;00:20:18,925;We took them by surprise.
240;00:20:19,010;00:20:22,053;Lord Varys knows what you had
240;00:20:19,010;00:20:22,053;for breakfast three days ago.
241;00:20:22,138;00:20:23,680;There are no surprises here.
242;00:20:23,764;00:20:25,891;If it's true there is dissension in their ranks,
243;00:20:25,975;00:20:27,726;maybe their sailors have mutinied.
244;00:20:28,185;00:20:29,352;Maybe.
245;00:20:45,912;00:20:47,829;I don't know why she wants me here.
246;00:20:47,914;00:20:50,790;She's always saying how stupid I am.
246;00:20:47,914;00:20:50,790;She hates me.
247;00:20:50,875;00:20:54,294;Maybe she hates you less than
247;00:20:50,875;00:20:54,294;she hates everyone else.
248;00:20:55,254;00:20:56,630;I doubt it.
249;00:20:57,173;00:20:59,299;Maybe she's jealous of you.
250;00:21:00,051;00:21:01,718;Why would she be jealous?
251;00:21:02,053;00:21:03,345;Sansa.
252;00:21:07,350;00:21:09,851;I was wondering where
252;00:21:07,350;00:21:09,851;our little dove had flown.
253;00:21:11,062;00:21:12,854;You look pale, child.
254;00:21:13,731;00:21:15,482;Is your red flower still blooming?
255;00:21:16,192;00:21:17,275;Yes.
256;00:21:18,152;00:21:19,361;Fitting, isn't it?
257;00:21:20,071;00:21:23,281;The men will bleed out there
257;00:21:20,071;00:21:23,281;and you will bleed in here.
258;00:21:24,116;00:21:25,909;Pour Lady Sansa some wine.
259;00:21:25,993;00:21:27,452;I'm not thirsty, Your Grace.
260;00:21:27,536;00:21:29,996;So? I didn't offer you water.
261;00:21:35,419;00:21:36,711;What's he doing here?
262;00:21:37,338;00:21:38,588;Ser llyn?
263;00:21:39,382;00:21:41,299;He's here to defend us.
264;00:21:41,842;00:21:44,970;When the axes smash down those doors,
264;00:21:41,842;00:21:44,970;you may be glad to have him.
265;00:21:45,388;00:21:47,305;But we have guards to defend us.
266;00:21:47,390;00:21:48,974;Guards we have paid.
267;00:21:49,058;00:21:51,559;Should the city fall,
267;00:21:49,058;00:21:51,559;they'll be the first ones out of the doors.
268;00:21:56,691;00:21:58,984;The lads caught a groom and two maids
268;00:21:56,691;00:21:58,984;trying to sneak away
269;00:21:59,068;00:22:01,111;with a stolen horse and some gold cups.
270;00:22:01,737;00:22:03,947;The battle's first traitors.
271;00:22:04,031;00:22:05,573;Have Ser llyn see to them.
272;00:22:05,658;00:22:09,369;Put their heads on spikes
272;00:22:05,658;00:22:09,369;outside the stables as a warning.
273;00:22:11,122;00:22:13,289;The only way to keep the small folk loyal
274;00:22:13,374;00:22:16,501;is to make certain they fear you
274;00:22:13,374;00:22:16,501;more than they do the enemy.
275;00:22:16,585;00:22:20,588;Remember that if you ever
275;00:22:16,585;00:22:20,588;hope to become a queen.
276;00:22:22,633;00:22:24,676;You said he was here to protect us.
277;00:22:27,263;00:22:28,471;He is.
278;00:22:29,473;00:22:31,599;Traitors are a danger to us all.
279;00:22:31,976;00:22:33,309;More wine.
280;00:22:48,200;00:22:49,743;There they are.
281;00:22:53,205;00:22:56,958;Archers to their marks.
281;00:22:53,205;00:22:56,958;Archers, to your marks!
282;00:22:59,628;00:23:00,795;Archers!
283;00:23:07,011;00:23:08,094;Nock your arrows!
284;00:23:08,721;00:23:10,305;Nock arrows!
285;00:23:11,807;00:23:14,142;Hold fast.
285;00:23:11,807;00:23:14,142;Hold fast!
286;00:23:14,518;00:23:16,895;What are you doing? We need to attack them.
287;00:23:16,979;00:23:19,898;Hold fast.
287;00:23:16,979;00:23:19,898;Boulders ready!
288;00:23:21,400;00:23:22,776;Hold fast!
289;00:23:25,488;00:23:27,739;There's only one ship.
289;00:23:25,488;00:23:27,739;Where are the rest of them?
290;00:23:28,991;00:23:30,784;Where are the rest of them?
291;00:23:35,414;00:23:36,623;There's only one ship.
292;00:23:40,544;00:23:42,545;Archers, stand to!
293;00:23:43,089;00:23:44,130;Man the below!
294;00:23:44,632;00:23:46,424;Nock.
294;00:23:44,632;00:23:46,424;Nock and set!
295;00:23:47,760;00:23:49,135;Draw!
296;00:23:55,184;00:23:56,267;Hold.
297;00:23:56,685;00:23:58,019;Hold.
298;00:24:06,529;00:24:08,530;There's no one on board.
299;00:24:14,662;00:24:16,496;More rocks coming up!
300;00:24:32,930;00:24:34,013;Hold.
301;00:24:41,313;00:24:42,355;Wildfire.
302;00:24:42,731;00:24:45,275;Steer clear! Steer clear!
303;00:25:10,426;00:25:12,468;Matthos! Get down!
304;00:26:46,814;00:26:48,940;Prepare to land.
304;00:26:46,814;00:26:48,940;Your Grace.
305;00:26:49,024;00:26:51,067;The dwarf has played his little trick.
306;00:26:51,151;00:26:53,861;The wildfire.
306;00:26:51,151;00:26:53,861;He can only play it once.
307;00:26:53,946;00:26:56,114;We're too far from the gates.
308;00:26:56,198;00:26:58,408;The fire, their archers...
309;00:26:58,826;00:27:00,535;Hundreds will die.
310;00:27:01,870;00:27:03,246;Thousands.
311;00:27:17,094;00:27:19,429;Come with me and take this city!
312;00:27:37,865;00:27:40,116;Sansa, come here, little dove.
313;00:27:46,248;00:27:47,582;My queen.
314;00:27:48,417;00:27:49,917;What are you doing?
315;00:27:50,294;00:27:51,294;Praying.
316;00:27:51,962;00:27:54,172;You're perfect, aren't you?
317;00:27:54,256;00:27:55,506;Praying.
318;00:27:56,467;00:27:58,176;What are you praying for?
319;00:27:58,260;00:28:00,553;For the gods to have mercy on us all.
320;00:28:00,637;00:28:02,597;Oh.
321;00:28:02,681;00:28:03,973;On all of us?
322;00:28:04,058;00:28:06,100;Yes, Your Grace.
322;00:28:04,058;00:28:06,100;Even me?
323;00:28:06,977;00:28:08,269;Of course, Your Grace.
324;00:28:08,729;00:28:09,854;Even Joffrey?
325;00:28:12,441;00:28:15,526;Joffrey is my...
325;00:28:12,441;00:28:15,526;Oh, shut up, you little fool.
326;00:28:15,611;00:28:18,696;Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all.
327;00:28:18,781;00:28:20,865;The gods have no mercy.
327;00:28:18,781;00:28:20,865;That's why they're gods.
328;00:28:22,493;00:28:25,119;My father told me that
328;00:28:22,493;00:28:25,119;when he caught me praying.
329;00:28:26,789;00:28:29,040;My mother had just died, you see.
330;00:28:29,124;00:28:33,294;I didn't really understand
330;00:28:29,124;00:28:33,294;the concept of death, the finality of it.
331;00:28:34,171;00:28:36,547;I thought that if I prayed very, very hard,
332;00:28:36,632;00:28:39,509;the gods would return my mother to me.
332;00:28:36,632;00:28:39,509;I was four.
333;00:28:40,302;00:28:42,470;Your father doesn't believe in the gods?
334;00:28:42,554;00:28:44,931;He believes in them,
334;00:28:42,554;00:28:44,931;he just doesn't like them very much.
335;00:28:48,352;00:28:49,811;One for her.
336;00:28:53,816;00:28:54,941;Here.
337;00:28:57,277;00:28:58,319;Sit.
338;00:28:58,946;00:29:00,113;Drink.
339;00:29:03,409;00:29:05,493;Not like that. Drink, girl.
340;00:29:09,081;00:29:11,082;I should have been born a man.
341;00:29:11,166;00:29:13,126;I'd rather face a thousand swords
342;00:29:13,210;00:29:16,671;than be shut up inside
342;00:29:13,210;00:29:16,671;with this flock of frightened hens.
343;00:29:17,214;00:29:20,675;They are your guests under your protection.
343;00:29:17,214;00:29:20,675;You asked them here.
344;00:29:20,968;00:29:22,927;It was expected of me,
345;00:29:23,011;00:29:26,514;as it will be of you
345;00:29:23,011;00:29:26,514;if you ever become Joffrey's queen.
346;00:29:27,307;00:29:30,768;If my wretched brother
346;00:29:27,307;00:29:30,768;should somehow prevail,
347;00:29:30,853;00:29:33,855;these hens will return to their cocks
348;00:29:34,356;00:29:37,900;and crow of how my courage inspired them,
349;00:29:37,985;00:29:39,902;lifted their spirits.
350;00:29:39,987;00:29:41,821;And if the city should fall?
351;00:29:44,366;00:29:45,741;You'd like that, wouldn't you?
352;00:29:47,119;00:29:48,953;The Red Keep should hold for a time,
353;00:29:49,037;00:29:53,541;long enough for me to go to the walls
353;00:29:49,037;00:29:53,541;and yield to Lord Stannis in person.
354;00:29:54,168;00:29:56,377;If it were anyone else outside those gates,
355;00:29:56,503;00:29:58,379;I might have hoped for a private audience,
356;00:29:58,464;00:30:00,715;but this is Stannis Baratheon.
357;00:30:01,425;00:30:04,886;I'd have a better chance
357;00:30:01,425;00:30:04,886;of seducing his horse.
358;00:30:08,223;00:30:10,475;Have I shocked you, little dove?
359;00:30:10,559;00:30:13,227;Tears aren't a woman's only weapon.
360;00:30:15,564;00:30:17,940;The best one's between your legs.
361;00:30:18,025;00:30:20,735;Learn how to use it. Drink.
362;00:30:24,531;00:30:28,242;Do you have any notion of what happens
362;00:30:24,531;00:30:28,242;when a city is sacked?
363;00:30:29,703;00:30:31,746;No, you wouldn't, would you?
364;00:30:33,248;00:30:35,750;If the city falls, these fine women
365;00:30:37,336;00:30:39,086;should be in for a bit of a rape.
366;00:30:40,339;00:30:43,841;Half of them will have bastards
366;00:30:40,339;00:30:43,841;in their bellies come the morning.
367;00:30:44,801;00:30:47,261;You'll be glad of your red flower then.
368;00:30:48,764;00:30:52,266;When a man's blood is up,
368;00:30:48,764;00:30:52,266;anything with tits looks good.
369;00:30:53,519;00:30:57,605;A precious thing like you
369;00:30:53,519;00:30:57,605;will look very, very good.
370;00:30:58,857;00:31:00,733;A slice of cake
371;00:31:00,817;00:31:02,944;just waiting to be eaten.
372;00:31:05,531;00:31:07,114;More pressure!
373;00:31:17,459;00:31:20,419;Pull! Pull!
373;00:31:17,459;00:31:20,419;That's it, men!
374;00:31:21,880;00:31:23,923;Pull! Pull!
375;00:31:28,512;00:31:31,389;He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon.
376;00:31:32,057;00:31:33,724;They're coming. They're coming ashore.
377;00:31:35,310;00:31:36,602;Rain fire on them.
378;00:31:37,479;00:31:38,521;Archers!
379;00:31:38,605;00:31:39,772;There are too many.
380;00:31:40,357;00:31:42,775;Hound, form a welcome party
380;00:31:40,357;00:31:42,775;for any Baratheon troop
381;00:31:42,859;00:31:44,694;that manages to touch solid ground.
382;00:31:46,947;00:31:49,740;Pod, run to the King's Gate.
383;00:31:50,367;00:31:52,368;Bring any men guarding it here, now.
384;00:31:52,452;00:31:53,536;Yes, my lord.
385;00:31:54,663;00:31:57,623;Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat.
386;00:31:58,083;00:31:59,375;You, too.
387;00:32:01,169;00:32:03,713;Any of these flaming fucking arrows
387;00:32:01,169;00:32:03,713;come near me,
388;00:32:03,797;00:32:06,382;I'll strangle you with your own guts.
389;00:32:09,678;00:32:13,222;Pull, pull! Go!
390;00:32:13,307;00:32:14,557;Nock!
391;00:32:18,520;00:32:20,146;Draw!
392;00:32:20,230;00:32:22,523;Draw!
392;00:32:20,230;00:32:22,523;Draw!
393;00:32:32,743;00:32:34,410;Kill the Lannisters!
394;00:32:34,494;00:32:37,204;Loose!
394;00:32:34,494;00:32:37,204;Loose!
395;00:32:46,757;00:32:48,549;Draw!
395;00:32:46,757;00:32:48,549;Draw!
396;00:32:48,634;00:32:50,843;Loose!
396;00:32:48,634;00:32:50,843;Loose!
397;00:33:35,722;00:33:37,181;To the Mud Gate, go now!
398;00:33:37,265;00:33:40,768;First and second squads, to the gate!
398;00:33:37,265;00:33:40,768;To the Mud Gate!
399;00:33:41,144;00:33:43,062;Any man dies with a clean sword,
400;00:33:43,146;00:33:45,439;I'll rape his fucking corpse.
401;00:34:20,809;00:34:22,560;CERSEl: When we were young, Jaime and I,
402;00:34:22,644;00:34:26,564;we looked so much alike
402;00:34:22,644;00:34:26,564;even our father couldn't tell us apart.
403;00:34:26,648;00:34:30,234;I could never understand why
403;00:34:26,648;00:34:30,234;they treated us differently.
404;00:34:30,986;00:34:34,780;Jaime was taught to fight
404;00:34:30,986;00:34:34,780;with sword and lance and mace,
405;00:34:35,240;00:34:37,491;and I was taught to smile
406;00:34:37,868;00:34:39,452;and sing and please.
407;00:34:39,995;00:34:42,163;He was heir to Casterly Rock,
408;00:34:42,831;00:34:45,374;and I was sold to some stranger like a horse
409;00:34:45,459;00:34:47,376;to be ridden whenever he desired.
410;00:34:47,711;00:34:49,795;You were Robert's queen.
411;00:34:49,880;00:34:52,006;And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy.
412;00:34:56,511;00:34:58,179;I don't think I know this one.
413;00:35:04,102;00:35:05,436;Pretty.
414;00:35:12,027;00:35:13,861;That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen.
415;00:35:14,362;00:35:16,697;Here, it's not difficult.
415;00:35:14,362;00:35:16,697;I mastered it when I was four.
416;00:35:17,407;00:35:19,658;Straighten your back and bend.
417;00:35:22,829;00:35:24,497;Better. You learn fast.
418;00:35:25,207;00:35:28,334;How long have you been
418;00:35:25,207;00:35:28,334;in Lady Sansa's service?
419;00:35:29,211;00:35:31,962;A few weeks, Your Grace.
420;00:35:34,633;00:35:36,550;When did you leave Lorath?
421;00:35:38,553;00:35:40,554;I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.
422;00:35:43,725;00:35:46,352;But she was a nobleman's daughter.
423;00:35:46,436;00:35:47,603;You're not.
424;00:35:51,817;00:35:53,442;When did you come to Westeros?
425;00:35:54,903;00:35:56,654;Ten years ago, Your Grace.
426;00:35:57,447;00:36:01,408;From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep
426;00:35:57,447;00:36:01,408;in 10 years,
427;00:36:01,868;00:36:04,370;all without learning how to curtsy.
428;00:36:05,413;00:36:07,456;I imagine that's a very interesting story.
429;00:36:08,959;00:36:09,959;What's your name?
430;00:36:10,669;00:36:12,419;Shae, Your Grace.
431;00:36:12,921;00:36:14,505;Tell us a story, Shae.
432;00:36:20,762;00:36:22,513;When I was 13, I...
433;00:36:24,891;00:36:25,975;Your Grace!
434;00:36:26,852;00:36:28,185;What news?
435;00:36:29,396;00:36:31,397;The Imp has set the river afire.
436;00:36:31,481;00:36:34,108;Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more.
437;00:36:34,192;00:36:36,610;Stannis' fleet destroyed, but...
438;00:36:37,654;00:36:38,696;But...
439;00:36:38,780;00:36:42,616;But his troops
439;00:36:38,780;00:36:42,616;have landed outside the city walls.
440;00:36:43,285;00:36:44,952;Where is Joffrey?
441;00:36:45,620;00:36:47,746;On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.
442;00:36:47,831;00:36:50,082;Bring him back inside at once.
443;00:36:50,667;00:36:52,459;Your Grace...
443;00:36:50,667;00:36:52,459;What?
444;00:36:52,961;00:36:55,296;The king's presence is good for morale.
445;00:36:55,380;00:36:58,090;Bring him back to his chambers now.
446;00:36:58,174;00:36:59,925;Not here?
446;00:36:58,174;00:36:59,925;With the women and children?
447;00:37:00,010;00:37:02,428;Do you want him to be mocked as a coward
447;00:37:00,010;00:37:02,428;for the rest of his life?
448;00:37:02,512;00:37:04,346;No, but I...
448;00:37:02,512;00:37:04,346;Now!
449;00:37:10,103;00:37:13,188;When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied.
450;00:37:15,400;00:37:16,817;Do you want to hear the truth?
451;00:37:17,110;00:37:19,278;You want to know why he's really here?
452;00:37:21,156;00:37:22,656;He's here for us.
453;00:37:23,325;00:37:25,910;Stannis may take the city,
453;00:37:23,325;00:37:25,910;he may take the throne,
454;00:37:25,994;00:37:27,912;but he will not take us alive.
455;00:38:02,197;00:38:03,238;Help me!
456;00:38:24,094;00:38:26,428;Fall back!
456;00:38:24,094;00:38:26,428;Fall back!
457;00:38:34,854;00:38:35,980;Get the ladders up!
458;00:39:09,681;00:39:12,099;Faster, you bastards! Faster!
459;00:39:12,684;00:39:14,601;Come on, kill the scum!
460;00:39:16,604;00:39:18,689;Someone bring me a drink.
461;00:39:24,946;00:39:27,448;Fuck the water. Bring me wine.
462;00:39:38,418;00:39:40,294;Can I get you some iced milk
463;00:39:40,378;00:39:42,546;and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?
464;00:39:43,131;00:39:44,298;Eat shit, dwarf.
465;00:39:45,091;00:39:46,884;You're on the wrong side of the wall.
466;00:39:47,135;00:39:48,886;I lost half my men.
467;00:39:50,430;00:39:52,431;The Blackwater's on fire.
468;00:39:52,515;00:39:55,726;Dog, I command you to
468;00:39:52,515;00:39:55,726;go back out there and fight.
469;00:39:59,773;00:40:01,648;You're Kingsguard, Clegane.
470;00:40:01,983;00:40:04,318;You must beat them back or
470;00:40:01,983;00:40:04,318;they're going to take this city.
471;00:40:04,944;00:40:06,779;Your king's city.
472;00:40:08,490;00:40:09,823;Fuck the Kingsguard.
473;00:40:11,493;00:40:12,618;Fuck the city.
474;00:40:14,162;00:40:15,204;Fuck the king.
475;00:40:33,556;00:40:34,807;Loose!
476;00:40:34,891;00:40:36,850;Put your backs into it!
477;00:40:37,352;00:40:39,019;All right, get up!
478;00:40:42,524;00:40:43,524;Loose!
479;00:40:43,608;00:40:44,691;Clear!

484;00:41:24,941;00:41:26,108;Heave!
485;00:41:26,568;00:41:27,901;Your Grace,
486;00:41:28,319;00:41:30,988;the queen has sent me to
486;00:41:28,319;00:41:30,988;bring you back to the Red Keep.
487;00:41:33,741;00:41:35,742;If you won't defend your own city,
487;00:41:33,741;00:41:35,742;why should they?
488;00:41:36,578;00:41:37,870;What would you have me do?
489;00:41:37,954;00:41:39,288;Lead.
490;00:41:39,372;00:41:42,583;Get down there and lead your people
490;00:41:39,372;00:41:42,583;against the invaders who want to kill them.
491;00:41:43,418;00:41:46,503;What did my mother say exactly?
491;00:41:43,418;00:41:46,503;Did she have urgent business with me?
492;00:41:46,588;00:41:47,921;She did not say, Your Grace.
493;00:41:49,757;00:41:51,884;All men to the battlements!
494;00:41:53,803;00:41:55,637;Ser Boros, Ser Mandon,
495;00:41:55,722;00:41:59,349;stay with my uncle and represent the king
495;00:41:55,722;00:41:59,349;on the field of battle.
496;00:42:00,810;00:42:03,103;Archers, hold your line
497;00:42:03,188;00:42:04,771;or I'll kill you myself.
498;00:42:08,651;00:42:10,110;Stand fast!
499;00:42:19,454;00:42:20,746;No!
500;00:42:22,290;00:42:23,790;Get up, you fool.
501;00:42:23,875;00:42:25,667;We need more arrows!
502;00:42:29,172;00:42:30,839;Where is the king?
503;00:42:30,924;00:42:34,009;Why isn't he with us?
503;00:42:30,924;00:42:34,009;Who are we fighting for?
504;00:42:35,803;00:42:37,054;Who leads us?
505;00:42:37,138;00:42:38,931;I'll lead the attack.
506;00:42:39,515;00:42:41,308;I'll lead the attack!
507;00:42:42,393;00:42:44,519;Yes.
507;00:42:42,393;00:42:44,519;What are you talking about?
508;00:42:45,021;00:42:46,146;Pod, my helmet.
509;00:42:48,816;00:42:50,817;Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner.
510;00:42:50,902;00:42:52,361;Men, form up.
511;00:42:54,948;00:42:56,031;Men...
512;00:42:57,659;00:42:58,825;Men!
513;00:42:59,452;00:43:02,079;They say I'm half a man.
514;00:43:02,163;00:43:04,831;But what does that make the lot of you?
515;00:43:04,916;00:43:07,459;The only way out is through the gates.
516;00:43:07,543;00:43:08,919;And they're at the gates.
517;00:43:09,003;00:43:11,421;There's another way out.
517;00:43:09,003;00:43:11,421;I'm going to show you.
518;00:43:12,257;00:43:15,092;We'll come out behind them
518;00:43:12,257;00:43:15,092;and fuck them in their arses.
519;00:43:17,929;00:43:19,137;Heave!
520;00:43:19,764;00:43:20,973;Heave!
521;00:43:21,599;00:43:23,558;Don't fight for your king
522;00:43:23,643;00:43:25,936;and don't fight for his kingdoms.
523;00:43:27,272;00:43:29,606;Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory.
524;00:43:29,691;00:43:32,067;Don't fight for riches,
524;00:43:29,691;00:43:32,067;because you won't get any.
525;00:43:32,568;00:43:35,028;This is your city Stannis means to sack.
526;00:43:35,113;00:43:36,863;That's your gate he's ramming.
527;00:43:37,282;00:43:40,200;If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns,
528;00:43:41,411;00:43:43,203;your gold he steals,
529;00:43:43,746;00:43:45,706;your women he will rape.
530;00:43:47,959;00:43:50,210;Heave! Heave!
531;00:43:51,212;00:43:52,379;Heave!
532;00:43:54,590;00:43:57,050;Those are brave men knocking at our door.
533;00:43:58,553;00:43:59,720;Let's go kill them.
534;00:44:22,577;00:44:24,870;The battle is lost, Your Grace.
535;00:44:25,413;00:44:28,165;Stannis' troops are at the gates.
536;00:44:28,249;00:44:30,959;When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving,
537;00:44:31,044;00:44:33,086;they lost all heart.
538;00:44:33,171;00:44:34,588;Where is my son?
539;00:44:34,672;00:44:36,590;I want to escort him back to the battle.
540;00:44:37,008;00:44:38,425;Why do I care what you want?
541;00:44:39,635;00:44:40,927;Bring me...
541;00:44:39,635;00:44:40,927;Now listen to me...
542;00:44:48,770;00:44:51,521;Don't be afraid.
542;00:44:48,770;00:44:51,521;The queen has raised the drawbridge.
543;00:44:51,606;00:44:53,899;This is the safest place we can be.
544;00:44:53,983;00:44:56,860;Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely.
545;00:44:56,944;00:44:58,904;His knights have rallied behind him.
546;00:44:58,988;00:45:00,197;They will save the city.
547;00:45:01,366;00:45:02,866;Shall we sing a hymn?
548;00:45:04,077;00:45:08,288;Gentle mother, font of mercy
549;00:45:08,790;00:45:12,667;Save our sons from war, we pray
550;00:45:14,545;00:45:15,879;You must go.
551;00:45:15,963;00:45:18,465;Run to your chamber and bar your door.
552;00:45:18,549;00:45:21,593;Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.
553;00:45:24,472;00:45:27,391;Come with me.
553;00:45:24,472;00:45:27,391;I need to say goodbye to someone.
554;00:45:27,475;00:45:29,559;The queen said they'd rape everyone.
555;00:45:29,811;00:45:31,311;No one is raping me.
556;00:45:34,148;00:45:35,565;Go. Run.
557;00:46:14,689;00:46:16,898;The lady is starting to panic.
558;00:46:18,151;00:46:19,609;What are you doing here?
559;00:46:19,694;00:46:21,528;Not here for long.
560;00:46:22,155;00:46:23,905;I'm going.
560;00:46:22,155;00:46:23,905;Where?
561;00:46:25,032;00:46:27,242;Someplace that isn't burning.
562;00:46:29,579;00:46:30,996;North, might be.
563;00:46:31,664;00:46:32,914;Could be.
564;00:46:34,000;00:46:35,750;What about the king?
565;00:46:36,919;00:46:39,546;He can die just fine on his own.
566;00:46:45,386;00:46:47,304;I can take you with me.
567;00:46:48,389;00:46:50,307;Take you to Winterfell.
568;00:46:55,396;00:46:57,189;I'll keep you safe.
569;00:46:59,775;00:47:01,693;Do you want to go home?
570;00:47:05,239;00:47:06,948;I'll be safe here.
571;00:47:07,033;00:47:08,200;Stannis won't hurt me.
572;00:47:10,411;00:47:11,828;Look at me.
573;00:47:13,539;00:47:15,290;Stannis is a killer.
574;00:47:16,375;00:47:17,626;The Lannisters are killers.
575;00:47:18,836;00:47:20,337;Your father was a killer.
576;00:47:21,214;00:47:23,215;Your brother is a killer.
577;00:47:24,926;00:47:26,760;Your sons will be killers someday.
578;00:47:29,222;00:47:31,556;The world is built by killers.
579;00:47:35,436;00:47:38,355;So you'd better get used to looking at them.
580;00:47:41,692;00:47:43,401;You won't hurt me.
581;00:47:50,368;00:47:52,744;No, little bird, I won't hurt you.
582;00:48:17,019;00:48:18,186;Heave!
583;00:48:24,193;00:48:26,736;Come on, you bastards! Get up those ladders!
584;00:48:30,950;00:48:32,325;Attack!
585;00:48:46,507;00:48:47,716;Roll it over!
586;00:48:54,932;00:48:59,019;Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!
587;00:49:10,364;00:49:12,032;Oh, fuck me.
588;00:50:03,668;00:50:05,085;Shh!
589;00:50:06,295;00:50:08,004;Be calm, my sweet.
590;00:50:08,089;00:50:09,964;They're still fighting.
591;00:50:11,884;00:50:13,968;No one's going to hurt you.
592;00:50:17,848;00:50:19,724;I'll tell you a story.
593;00:50:20,768;00:50:23,311;You know the one about
593;00:50:20,768;00:50:23,311;the mother lion and her little cub?
594;00:50:24,021;00:50:26,606;They lived in the woods.
594;00:50:24,021;00:50:26,606;The Kingswood?
595;00:50:26,691;00:50:28,191;Yes, my love.
596;00:50:28,901;00:50:32,362;In the Kingswood,
596;00:50:28,901;00:50:32,362;there lived a mother and her cub.
597;00:50:32,446;00:50:34,322;She loved him very much.
598;00:50:36,325;00:50:39,369;But there were other things
598;00:50:36,325;00:50:39,369;that lived in the woods. Evil things.
599;00:50:39,453;00:50:40,787;Like what?
600;00:50:43,290;00:50:44,666;Like stags.
601;00:50:45,751;00:50:47,252;Stags aren't evil.
602;00:50:47,336;00:50:49,129;They only eat grass.
603;00:50:49,588;00:50:50,630;And wolves.
604;00:50:51,132;00:50:52,590;My lord.
605;00:50:52,675;00:50:54,676;CERSEl: He could hear them
605;00:50:52,675;00:50:54,676;howling in the night.
606;00:50:55,010;00:50:57,053;The little cub was frightened.
607;00:50:57,138;00:51:01,433;His mother said, You are a lion, my son.
607;00:50:57,138;00:51:01,433;You mustn't be afraid.
608;00:51:15,239;00:51:17,824;For one day, all the beasts will bow to you.
609;00:51:17,908;00:51:19,576;You will be king.
610;00:51:21,704;00:51:24,873;All the stags will bow.
610;00:51:21,704;00:51:24,873;All the wolves will bow.
611;00:51:25,791;00:51:29,043;The bears in the north
611;00:51:25,791;00:51:29,043;and the foxes of the south,
612;00:51:30,671;00:51:34,090;all the birds in the sky
612;00:51:30,671;00:51:34,090;and the beasts in the sea,
613;00:51:36,177;00:51:38,887;they will all come to you, little lion,
614;00:51:39,930;00:51:41,264;to rest a crown upon your head.
615;00:51:47,646;00:51:49,147;And the cub said,
616;00:51:49,231;00:51:52,192;Will I be strong and fierce like my father?
617;00:51:53,652;00:51:55,528;Yes, said his mother.
618;00:51:56,238;00:51:59,199;You will be strong and fierce
618;00:51:56,238;00:51:59,199;just like your father.
619;00:52:17,760;00:52:21,554;I will keep you safe, my love.
620;00:52:22,389;00:52:23,556;I promise you.
621;00:52:32,817;00:52:34,526;Back to the boats!
622;00:52:36,737;00:52:38,404;Stand and fight!
623;00:52:39,907;00:52:42,492;Stand and fight, damn you!
624;00:52:43,327;00:52:44,786;No!
625;00:52:47,832;00:52:49,249;Father.
626;00:52:54,547;00:52:57,549;The battle is over. We have won.
627;00:53:06,934;00:53:11,938;And who are you,
627;00:53:06,934;00:53:11,938;the proud lord said
628;00:53:12,022;00:53:16,359;That I must bow so low?
629;00:53:17,278;00:53:21,948;Only a cat of a different coat
630;00:53:22,032;00:53:26,452;That's all the truth I know
631;00:53:27,121;00:53:32,125;In a coat of gold or a coat of red
632;00:53:32,209;00:53:37,130;A lion still has claws
633;00:53:37,214;00:53:42,218;And mine are long and sharp, my lord
634;00:53:42,303;00:53:46,556;As long and sharp as yours
635;00:53:49,393;00:53:54,689;And so he spoke, and so he spoke
636;00:53:54,773;00:53:59,694;That Lord of Castamere
637;00:53:59,778;00:54:04,824;But now the rains weep o'er his hall
638;00:54:04,909;00:54:09,621;With no one there to hear
639;00:54:09,705;00:54:15,084;Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall
640;00:54:15,169;00:54:19,797;And not a soul to hear
