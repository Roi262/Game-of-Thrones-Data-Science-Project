133;00:09:10,683;00:09:12,717;With your hands, then?
134;00:09:12,752;00:09:15,888;No wonder
134;00:09:12,752;00:09:15,888;you're all so miserable.
135;00:09:15,922;00:09:17,390;Would you please shut up?
136;00:09:17,424;00:09:19,559;( Mocking )
136;00:09:17,424;00:09:19,559;Would you please shut up?
137;00:09:20,661;00:09:23,129;You think you're
137;00:09:20,661;00:09:23,129;better than me, crow.
138;00:09:23,163;00:09:25,698;I'm a free woman--
138;00:09:23,163;00:09:25,698;You're a free woman?
139;00:09:25,732;00:09:28,001;I might be your prisoner,
139;00:09:25,732;00:09:28,001;but I'm a free woman.
140;00:09:28,035;00:09:29,969;If you're my prisoner,
140;00:09:28,035;00:09:29,969;you're not a free woman.
141;00:09:30,004;00:09:31,604;That's what
141;00:09:30,004;00:09:31,604;prisoner means.
142;00:09:31,639;00:09:33,706;And you think you're free?
143;00:09:34,742;00:09:36,709;You swore
143;00:09:34,742;00:09:36,709;some stupid oath
144;00:09:36,744;00:09:38,211;and now you can never
144;00:09:36,744;00:09:38,211;touch a girl.
145;00:09:38,245;00:09:40,713;It was my choice
145;00:09:38,245;00:09:40,713;to say the words.
146;00:09:40,747;00:09:42,615;So you don't like girls?
146;00:09:40,747;00:09:42,615;Of course I like girls.
147;00:09:42,649;00:09:44,617;But you chose
147;00:09:42,649;00:09:44,617;never to touch them.
148;00:09:44,651;00:09:47,354;That's the price you pay if you want
148;00:09:44,651;00:09:47,354;to be a man of the Night's Watch.
149;00:09:47,388;00:09:49,222;So instead of getting
149;00:09:47,388;00:09:49,222;naked with a girl,
150;00:09:49,257;00:09:50,791;you'd prefer
150;00:09:49,257;00:09:50,791;to invade our lands--
151;00:09:50,825;00:09:52,492;Invade your lands?
152;00:09:52,527;00:09:54,461;Wildlings raid
152;00:09:52,527;00:09:54,461;our lands all the time.
153;00:09:54,496;00:09:57,398;Some of them tried to kill my
153;00:09:54,496;00:09:57,398;little brother, a crippled boy!
154;00:09:57,432;00:09:59,401;They're not your lands!
155;00:09:59,435;00:10:01,470;We've been here
155;00:09:59,435;00:10:01,470;the whole time.
156;00:10:01,504;00:10:03,395;You lot came along
156;00:10:01,504;00:10:03,395;and just put up a big wall
157;00:10:03,420;00:10:05,074;and said it was yours.
158;00:10:05,075;00:10:07,710;My father was Ned Stark.
159;00:10:07,745;00:10:09,712;I have the blood
159;00:10:07,745;00:10:09,712;of the First Men.
160;00:10:09,746;00:10:12,982;My ancestors lived here,
160;00:10:09,746;00:10:12,982;same as yours.
161;00:10:15,286;00:10:17,420;So why are you
161;00:10:15,286;00:10:17,420;fighting us?
162;00:10:33,439;00:10:35,574;Go on.
163;00:10:40,514;00:10:43,149;Now I want you
163;00:10:40,514;00:10:43,149;to tell me what happened.
164;00:10:43,183;00:10:46,386;Guard: Come on, this way.
164;00:10:43,183;00:10:46,386;( Man screaming )
165;00:10:47,387;00:10:50,022;Come on, speak up.
165;00:10:47,387;00:10:50,022;Speak up.
166;00:10:53,793;00:10:55,260;( Sniffs )

168;00:10:57,996;00:11:00,565;a rare substance.
169;00:11:00,599;00:11:03,033;This is no common assassin.
170;00:11:03,068;00:11:05,202;We hanged 20 men
170;00:11:03,068;00:11:05,202;last night.
171;00:11:05,237;00:11:08,038;I don't care
171;00:11:05,237;00:11:08,038;if you hanged 100.
172;00:11:08,072;00:11:09,573;A man tried to kill me.
173;00:11:09,607;00:11:11,642;I want his name
173;00:11:09,607;00:11:11,642;and I want his head.
174;00:11:11,677;00:11:13,144;Mountain: We think it was
174;00:11:11,677;00:11:13,144;an infiltrator
175;00:11:13,178;00:11:16,014;from the Brotherhood
175;00:11:13,178;00:11:16,014;Without Banners.
176;00:11:16,048;00:11:18,817;Pretentious name
176;00:11:16,048;00:11:18,817;for a band of outlaws.

178;00:11:21,454;00:11:23,522;to harass us
178;00:11:21,454;00:11:23,522;with impunity.
179;00:11:23,556;00:11:25,657;We look like fools
179;00:11:23,556;00:11:25,657;and they look like heroes.
180;00:11:25,692;00:11:27,425;That's how kings fall.
181;00:11:27,460;00:11:29,628;I want them dead,

182;00:11:29,662;00:11:31,429;isn't the problem.
183;00:11:31,464;00:11:33,399;It's finding them.
184;00:11:33,433;00:11:35,701;Have you gone soft,

187;00:11:41,508;00:11:43,876;to choose the wrong side.
188;00:11:43,910;00:11:45,344;Mmm.
189;00:11:47,914;00:11:50,049;Is that mutton?
190;00:11:50,083;00:11:51,584;Yes, My Lord.
191;00:11:51,618;00:11:53,186;Don't like mutton.
192;00:11:54,187;00:11:56,155;I'll bring
192;00:11:54,187;00:11:56,155;something else.
193;00:11:56,190;00:11:58,291;Leave it.
194;00:11:59,526;00:12:01,827;Are you hungry?
194;00:11:59,526;00:12:01,827;No.
195;00:12:01,861;00:12:03,495;Of course you are.
196;00:12:03,529;00:12:05,063;Eat.
197;00:12:05,098;00:12:08,333;I'll eat
197;00:12:05,098;00:12:08,333;in the kitchen later.
198;00:12:08,368;00:12:12,537;It's bad manners

199;00:12:12,571;00:12:14,673;Sit.
200;00:12:15,741;00:12:17,242;Eat.

202;00:12:23,248;00:12:25,416;I suppose you've been
202;00:12:23,248;00:12:25,416;underfed your whole life.
203;00:12:25,450;00:12:27,151;I eat a lot.
204;00:12:27,186;00:12:30,355;I just don't grow.
204;00:12:27,186;00:12:30,355;Hmm.
205;00:12:33,659;00:12:37,563;This will be my last war,
206;00:12:37,597;00:12:39,732;win or lose.
207;00:12:40,801;00:12:42,836;Have you ever

209;00:12:52,680;00:12:56,551;But this is the one
209;00:12:52,680;00:12:56,551;I'll be remembered for.

213;00:13:10,234;00:13:12,802;It's what you pass down
213;00:13:10,234;00:13:12,802;to your children
214;00:13:12,836;00:13:16,205;and your children's

215;00:13:16,240;00:13:19,275;It's what remains of you
215;00:13:16,240;00:13:19,275;when you're gone.

216;00:13:23,014;00:13:26,182;would be his legacy.
217;00:13:27,785;00:13:30,553;The greatest fortress
217;00:13:27,785;00:13:30,553;ever built--

219;00:13:34,158;00:13:37,694;had 35 hearths.
220;00:13:37,728;00:13:40,864;35. Can you imagine?
221;00:13:40,898;00:13:42,532;Look at it now--
222;00:13:43,734;00:13:45,535;a blasted ruin.
223;00:13:47,070;00:13:48,638;Do you know
223;00:13:47,070;00:13:48,638;what happened?

225;00:13:51,008;00:13:55,078;Yes, dragons happened.
226;00:13:57,515;00:14:02,018;Harrenhal was built to withstand
226;00:13:57,515;00:14:02,018;an attack from the land.

228;00:14:07,324;00:14:09,692;would have been repelled.
229;00:14:09,726;00:14:15,330;But an attack from the air
229;00:14:09,726;00:14:15,330;with dragon fire-- mm.
230;00:14:15,364;00:14:18,766;Harren and all his sons
230;00:14:15,364;00:14:18,766;roasted alive within these walls.

236;00:14:33,915;00:14:37,150;It wasn't just Aegon
236;00:14:33,915;00:14:37,150;riding his dragon.
237;00:14:37,184;00:14:39,019;It was Rhaenys

243;00:14:52,302;00:14:56,606;was a great warrior.

245;00:14:59,577;00:15:01,878;Hmm.
246;00:15:01,913;00:15:04,081;She's a heroine
246;00:15:01,913;00:15:04,081;of yours, I take it?
247;00:15:05,349;00:15:06,983;Aren't most girls
247;00:15:05,349;00:15:06,983;more interested
248;00:15:07,018;00:15:08,952;in the pretty maidens
248;00:15:07,018;00:15:08,952;from the songs?

251;00:15:14,958;00:15:17,458;You remind me

257;00:15:36,947;00:15:39,716;stonemasons, My Lord?
258;00:15:42,153;00:15:44,121;Careful now, girl.
259;00:15:44,155;00:15:46,357;I enjoy you,
259;00:15:44,155;00:15:46,357;but be careful.
260;00:15:46,391;00:15:49,226;Take that back
260;00:15:46,391;00:15:49,226;to the kitchen.
261;00:15:49,260;00:15:51,028;Eat what you want.
262;00:15:54,131;00:15:56,099;And, girl.
263;00:15:57,769;00:15:59,870;M'lord.
264;00:16:01,439;00:16:03,940;Lowborn girls
264;00:16:01,439;00:16:03,940;say M'lord,
265;00:16:03,975;00:16:06,343;not My Lord.
266;00:16:06,377;00:16:08,612;If you're going
266;00:16:06,377;00:16:08,612;to pose as a commoner,
267;00:16:08,646;00:16:10,781;you should do it
267;00:16:08,646;00:16:10,781;properly.
268;00:16:12,283;00:16:13,917;My mother served
268;00:16:12,283;00:16:13,917;Lady Dustin
269;00:16:13,951;00:16:16,886;for many years,
269;00:16:13,951;00:16:16,886;My Lord.
270;00:16:16,921;00:16:20,390;She taught me how to speak
270;00:16:16,921;00:16:20,390;proper-- properly.
271;00:16:22,226;00:16:23,994;You're too smart
271;00:16:22,226;00:16:23,994;for your own good.
272;00:16:24,028;00:16:27,230;Has anyone told you that?
272;00:16:24,028;00:16:27,230;Yes.
273;00:16:28,265;00:16:29,933;Go on.
274;00:16:41,178;00:16:44,580;I beg pardon, Ser.
275;00:16:44,615;00:16:46,916;I should have
275;00:16:44,615;00:16:46,916;come to you after
276;00:16:46,950;00:16:49,252;to thank you
276;00:16:46,950;00:16:49,252;for saving me.
277;00:16:49,286;00:16:51,621;You were so brave.
277;00:16:49,286;00:16:51,621;Brave?
278;00:16:51,655;00:16:55,191;A dog doesn't need courage
278;00:16:51,655;00:16:55,191;to chase off rats.
279;00:16:55,225;00:16:57,993;Does it give you joy
279;00:16:55,225;00:16:57,993;to scare people?
280;00:16:58,027;00:17:00,930;No. It gives me joy
280;00:16:58,027;00:17:00,930;to kill people.
281;00:17:00,964;00:17:03,231;Spare me.
281;00:17:00,964;00:17:03,231;You can't tell me
282;00:17:03,266;00:17:06,234;Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell
282;00:17:03,266;00:17:06,234;never killed a man.
283;00:17:06,268;00:17:09,437;It was his duty.
283;00:17:06,268;00:17:09,437;He never liked it.
284;00:17:09,471;00:17:11,539;Is that what he told you?
285;00:17:11,573;00:17:14,007;He lied.
286;00:17:14,041;00:17:16,977;Killing is the sweetest
286;00:17:14,041;00:17:16,977;thing there is.
287;00:17:17,011;00:17:19,645;Why are you always
287;00:17:17,011;00:17:19,645;so hateful?
288;00:17:19,680;00:17:21,447;You'll be glad
288;00:17:19,680;00:17:21,447;of the hateful things I do
289;00:17:21,482;00:17:24,250;someday when you're queen
289;00:17:21,482;00:17:24,250;and I'm all that stands
290;00:17:24,284;00:17:26,753;between you
290;00:17:24,284;00:17:26,753;and your beloved king.
291;00:17:36,465;00:17:37,999;I've demanded a meeting
291;00:17:36,465;00:17:37,999;of the Thirteen.
292;00:17:38,033;00:17:39,834;One of them did this
292;00:17:38,033;00:17:39,834;or knows who did.
293;00:17:39,869;00:17:41,436;You are one
293;00:17:39,869;00:17:41,436;of the Thirteen.
294;00:17:41,471;00:17:43,505;If I wanted your dragons,
294;00:17:41,471;00:17:43,505;I would have taken them.
295;00:17:43,539;00:17:46,808;They mean nothing to me on their own.
295;00:17:43,539;00:17:46,808;Nothing?
296;00:17:46,842;00:17:49,444;They're more valuable
296;00:17:46,842;00:17:49,444;than anything in the world.
297;00:17:49,478;00:17:52,213;Shall we look inside my vault and see
297;00:17:49,478;00:17:52,213;what selling your dragons
298;00:17:52,247;00:17:54,215;would buy me
298;00:17:52,247;00:17:54,215;I cannot buy already?
299;00:17:54,249;00:17:56,383;We will get them back.
300;00:17:56,417;00:17:58,251;There is no we,
301;00:17:58,286;00:18:00,787;so why would you help me
301;00:17:58,286;00:18:00,787;get them back?
302;00:18:00,821;00:18:02,588;I took you
302;00:18:00,821;00:18:02,588;under my protection
303;00:18:02,623;00:18:04,690;in front of the rulers
303;00:18:02,623;00:18:04,690;of my city.
304;00:18:04,725;00:18:07,760;A man is what others
304;00:18:04,725;00:18:07,760;say he is and no more.
305;00:18:07,795;00:18:10,397;If they say that
305;00:18:07,795;00:18:10,397;Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar,
306;00:18:10,432;00:18:12,867;my word is worth nothing.
307;00:18:12,901;00:18:15,470;I cannot let this thing
307;00:18:12,901;00:18:15,470;happen to you under my roof.
308;00:18:15,504;00:18:17,873;But it did happen
308;00:18:15,504;00:18:17,873;under your roof.
309;00:18:17,907;00:18:21,476;Khaleesi, many times
309;00:18:17,907;00:18:21,476;in my life I have been--
310;00:18:21,511;00:18:23,245;I don't care
310;00:18:21,511;00:18:23,245;where you've been.
311;00:18:45,866;00:18:50,102;You think we're savages because
311;00:18:45,866;00:18:50,102;we don't live in stone castles.
312;00:18:50,137;00:18:54,073;We can't make steel as good
312;00:18:50,137;00:18:54,073;as yours, it's true, but...
313;00:18:54,108;00:18:56,642;We're free.
314;00:18:56,677;00:18:58,469;If someone tried to tell us
314;00:18:56,677;00:18:58,469;we couldn't lie down
315;00:18:58,494;00:18:59,946;as man and woman,
316;00:18:59,947;00:19:02,515;we'd shove a spear
316;00:18:59,947;00:19:02,515;up his ass.
317;00:19:02,549;00:19:04,484;We don't go serving
317;00:19:02,549;00:19:04,484;some shit king
318;00:19:04,518;00:19:06,085;who's only king
318;00:19:04,518;00:19:06,085;because his father was.
319;00:19:06,120;00:19:09,523;No. No, you serve
319;00:19:06,120;00:19:09,523;Mance Rayder,
320;00:19:09,557;00:19:10,957;the King-Beyond-the-Wall.
321;00:19:10,992;00:19:13,894;We chose Mance Rayder
321;00:19:10,992;00:19:13,894;to lead us.
322;00:19:13,929;00:19:16,297;He was a crow,
322;00:19:13,929;00:19:16,297;same as you,
323;00:19:16,331;00:19:18,599;but he wanted
323;00:19:16,331;00:19:18,599;to be free.
324;00:19:19,869;00:19:23,105;You could be free, too.
325;00:19:23,139;00:19:24,739;You don't need to live
325;00:19:23,139;00:19:24,739;your whole life
326;00:19:24,774;00:19:26,974;taking commands
326;00:19:24,774;00:19:26,974;from old men.
327;00:19:27,008;00:19:29,977;Wake up when you want
327;00:19:27,008;00:19:29,977;to wake up.
328;00:19:30,011;00:19:32,913;I could show you the streams
328;00:19:30,011;00:19:32,913;to fish, the woods to hunt.
329;00:19:32,947;00:19:37,149;Build yourself a cabin and find
329;00:19:32,947;00:19:37,149;a woman to lie with in the night.
330;00:19:38,985;00:19:40,752;You're a pretty lad.
331;00:19:40,787;00:19:44,155;The girls would claw each other's
331;00:19:40,787;00:19:44,155;eyes out to get naked with you.
332;00:19:46,625;00:19:49,294;Walk.
333;00:19:50,830;00:19:52,597;I could teach you
333;00:19:50,830;00:19:52,597;how to do it.
334;00:19:52,632;00:19:54,833;I know how to do it.
335;00:19:57,303;00:20:00,673;You know nothing,
335;00:19:57,303;00:20:00,673;Jon Snow.
336;00:20:21,528;00:20:24,163;( Chatter )
337;00:20:29,335;00:20:31,136;And what did she say?
338;00:20:31,171;00:20:33,805;She admired your spirit,
338;00:20:31,171;00:20:33,805;Your Grace.
339;00:20:33,839;00:20:35,840;And what then?
340;00:20:37,743;00:20:40,012;She, uh...
341;00:20:40,046;00:20:42,014;If every man
341;00:20:40,046;00:20:42,014;were held accountable
342;00:20:42,049;00:20:44,016;for the actions
342;00:20:42,049;00:20:44,016;of every distant relative,
343;00:20:44,050;00:20:47,219;Ser Alton, we'd all hang.
344;00:20:49,823;00:20:53,592;She tore the paper
344;00:20:49,823;00:20:53,592;in half, Your Grace.
345;00:20:53,626;00:20:55,127;You've acted with honor.
346;00:20:55,161;00:20:57,229;I thank you for it.
347;00:20:57,263;00:21:00,299;Lord Karstark, see that
347;00:20:57,263;00:21:00,299;Ser Alton's pen is clean.
348;00:21:00,333;00:21:01,800;And give him a hot supper.
349;00:21:01,835;00:21:04,304;Ser Alton's pen
349;00:21:01,835;00:21:04,304;is occupied, Your Grace.
350;00:21:04,338;00:21:06,873;The prisoners
350;00:21:04,338;00:21:06,873;from the Yellow Fork.
351;00:21:06,908;00:21:08,942;Too many prisoners.
352;00:21:08,977;00:21:11,712;Is there room
352;00:21:08,977;00:21:11,712;for Ser Alton?
353;00:21:11,747;00:21:14,949;Does he need
353;00:21:11,747;00:21:14,949;to lie down?
354;00:21:17,119;00:21:19,221;Have the men
354;00:21:17,119;00:21:19,221;build him a new pen.
355;00:21:19,255;00:21:21,890;Put him in with
355;00:21:19,255;00:21:21,890;the Kingslayer for now.
356;00:21:21,925;00:21:24,093;Have your boy
356;00:21:21,925;00:21:24,093;watch over them.
357;00:21:24,127;00:21:26,762;Torrhen.
358;00:21:26,796;00:21:28,430;That will be all.
359;00:21:35,104;00:21:36,637;Your Grace.
360;00:21:36,672;00:21:38,906;A minute of your time?
361;00:21:53,122;00:21:55,357;I've been treating
361;00:21:53,122;00:21:55,357;your wounded men.
362;00:21:55,391;00:21:58,003;And my enemies
362;00:21:55,391;00:21:58,003;as some of my bannermen
363;00:21:58,028;00:21:59,695;are fond of mentioning.
364;00:21:59,696;00:22:01,330;They're not my enemies.
365;00:22:01,364;00:22:03,466;That's what I tell
365;00:22:01,364;00:22:03,466;my bannermen.
366;00:22:03,500;00:22:06,202;I've already run through the
366;00:22:03,500;00:22:06,202;supplies I brought with me.
367;00:22:06,236;00:22:07,636;Some are easily replaced--
368;00:22:07,671;00:22:10,639;egg yolks, turpentine,
368;00:22:07,671;00:22:10,639;oil of roses.
369;00:22:10,673;00:22:13,075;But some are not.
370;00:22:13,109;00:22:16,177;I need silk
370;00:22:13,109;00:22:16,177;for stitching.
371;00:22:17,646;00:22:20,448;I need fennel root
371;00:22:17,646;00:22:20,448;for those with fever, willow bark.
372;00:22:20,482;00:22:22,683;Mostly I need
372;00:22:20,482;00:22:22,683;milk of the poppy.
373;00:22:22,718;00:22:25,886;You saw what it was like
373;00:22:22,718;00:22:25,886;to amputate a foot without any.
374;00:22:25,920;00:22:27,933;I assume there will be
374;00:22:25,920;00:22:27,933;more loss of limb before
375;00:22:27,958;00:22:29,523;this war is over.
376;00:22:29,524;00:22:33,561;If you need help finding these--
376;00:22:29,524;00:22:33,561;I know where to find them.
377;00:22:34,697;00:22:37,399;I'm sorry, I shouldn't
377;00:22:34,697;00:22:37,399;interrupt you.
378;00:22:37,433;00:22:40,736;Continue, My Lady.
379;00:22:43,908;00:22:45,803;You're riding to the Crag

520;00:31:07,348;00:31:10,183;To tell her Grace.

525;00:31:42,250;00:31:45,419;thought it would be different.
526;00:31:45,454;00:31:46,954;In what way?
527;00:31:46,989;00:31:50,158;I thought
527;00:31:46,989;00:31:50,158;it would be less--
528;00:31:50,193;00:31:53,295;less messy.

539;00:32:25,193;00:32:27,628;the pain.
540;00:32:27,663;00:32:29,564;I screamed so loudly,
540;00:32:27,663;00:32:29,564;I was sure
541;00:32:29,598;00:32:31,066;Robert would hear me
541;00:32:29,598;00:32:31,066;in the Kingswood.

546;00:32:42,947;00:32:45,549;would flee to the trees
547;00:32:45,583;00:32:50,420;with his huntsmen
547;00:32:45,583;00:32:50,420;and his hounds.
548;00:32:50,454;00:32:51,988;And when he returned,
548;00:32:50,454;00:32:51,988;he would present me
549;00:32:52,022;00:32:55,224;with some pelts
549;00:32:52,022;00:32:55,224;or a stag's head,
550;00:32:55,258;00:32:57,125;and I would present him
550;00:32:55,258;00:32:57,125;with a baby.
551;00:32:58,894;00:33:01,563;Not that I wanted
551;00:32:58,894;00:33:01,563;him there, mind you.
552;00:33:01,597;00:33:04,632;I had Grand Maester Pycelle,
552;00:33:01,597;00:33:04,632;an army of midwives,
553;00:33:04,666;00:33:06,634;and I had my brother.
554;00:33:06,668;00:33:10,005;When they told Jaime he wasn't
554;00:33:06,668;00:33:10,005;allowed in the birthing room,
555;00:33:10,039;00:33:13,375;he smiled and asked
555;00:33:10,039;00:33:13,375;which one of them
556;00:33:13,410;00:33:15,543;proposed to keep him out.
557;00:33:18,648;00:33:21,217;Joffrey will show you
557;00:33:18,648;00:33:21,217;no such devotion.

562;00:33:38,868;00:33:41,136;some womanly wisdom with you
563;00:33:41,170;00:33:44,172;on this very special day.

565;00:33:48,042;00:33:51,612;You'll do things for them that

568;00:34:00,621;00:34:04,190;On that front,
568;00:34:00,621;00:34:04,190;a mother has no choice.
569;00:34:04,224;00:34:08,862;But... shouldn't

641;00:37:50,051;00:37:53,354;who only used red.
642;00:37:55,824;00:37:59,928;I couldn't imagine being

644;00:38:02,198;00:38:04,554;And to help him do that,
644;00:38:02,198;00:38:04,554;to be a part of something
645;00:38:04,579;00:38:06,579;that perfect...
646;00:38:08,805;00:38:11,374;I don't need to explain
646;00:38:08,805;00:38:11,374;how that felt, not to you.
647;00:38:12,376;00:38:14,077;It's hard to put
647;00:38:12,376;00:38:14,077;into words.
648;00:38:14,111;00:38:17,247;It's like stepping
648;00:38:14,111;00:38:17,247;into a dream

650;00:38:20,485;00:38:22,319;and finding out

651;00:38:22,353;00:38:25,389;is more real
651;00:38:22,353;00:38:25,389;than your life.

652;00:38:27,826;00:38:30,929;that battlefield was
653;00:38:30,963;00:38:33,064;like being dragged off
653;00:38:30,963;00:38:33,064;to prison.
654;00:38:33,099;00:38:36,468;Did you squire for him again?
654;00:38:33,099;00:38:36,468;No.
655;00:38:37,571;00:38:40,239;I didn't have your gift.

656;00:38:40,274;00:38:43,610;without stepping on me.
657;00:38:43,644;00:38:46,946;I was awful,

658;00:38:46,980;00:38:50,583;until one of the outlaws
659;00:38:50,617;00:38:54,186;decided to take on
659;00:38:50,617;00:38:54,186;a 16-year-old squire.

663;00:39:13,806;00:39:15,507;Shocking, I know.

666;00:39:20,814;00:39:24,250;right up until the end.
667;00:39:24,285;00:39:27,753;But me, though--
667;00:39:24,285;00:39:27,753;my life has left me
668;00:39:27,788;00:39:30,823;uniquely unfit
668;00:39:27,788;00:39:30,823;for constraint.

677;00:40:02,256;00:40:05,225;It's actually quite simple.

766;00:46:20,739;00:46:23,641;this man
766;00:46:20,739;00:46:23,641;is our prisoner.
767;00:46:23,675;00:46:25,576;This monster
767;00:46:23,675;00:46:25,576;killed my son.
768;00:46:25,611;00:46:27,646;And crippled mine.
769;00:46:27,680;00:46:29,447;He will answer
769;00:46:27,680;00:46:29,447;for his crimes,
770;00:46:29,482;00:46:31,515;I promise you,
770;00:46:29,482;00:46:31,515;but not here.
771;00:46:31,550;00:46:33,852;I will have his head.
771;00:46:31,550;00:46:33,852;And if you try and stop me--
772;00:46:33,886;00:46:36,287;You will strike me down?
773;00:46:36,321;00:46:38,623;Have you forgotten me, Ser?
774;00:46:38,657;00:46:40,725;I am the widow of your
774;00:46:38,657;00:46:40,725;liege Lord Eddark Stark.
775;00:46:40,759;00:46:42,260;I am the mother
775;00:46:40,759;00:46:42,260;of your king!
776;00:46:42,294;00:46:45,129;And where is our king now?
776;00:46:42,294;00:46:45,129;You know very well.
777;00:46:45,164;00:46:47,299;He has gone to the Crag
777;00:46:45,164;00:46:47,299;to accept the surrender.
778;00:46:47,333;00:46:51,069;Aye, gone to the Crag,
778;00:46:47,333;00:46:51,069;but not to negotiate.
779;00:46:51,103;00:46:53,004;He brought that
779;00:46:51,103;00:46:53,004;foreign bitch with him.
780;00:46:53,039;00:46:53,846;How dare you?
781;00:46:53,871;00:46:55,992;Threatening My Lady
781;00:46:53,871;00:46:55,992;is an act of treason.
782;00:46:56,076;00:46:57,276;Treason?
783;00:46:57,310;00:46:59,078;How can it be treason
783;00:46:57,310;00:46:59,078;to kill Lannisters?
784;00:46:59,112;00:47:01,180;I understand
784;00:46:59,112;00:47:01,180;your grief, My Lord--
785;00:47:01,215;00:47:03,649;better than most
785;00:47:01,215;00:47:03,649;I understand it--
786;00:47:03,683;00:47:06,619;but in the name of my son,
786;00:47:03,683;00:47:06,619;the King in the North,
787;00:47:06,654;00:47:08,688;stand down.
788;00:47:10,224;00:47:11,991;When your son returns,
789;00:47:12,026;00:47:14,427;I will demand
789;00:47:12,026;00:47:14,427;this murderer's head.
790;00:47:14,461;00:47:16,696;Wise men do not
790;00:47:14,461;00:47:16,696;make demands of kings.
791;00:47:16,730;00:47:19,932;Fathers who love
791;00:47:16,730;00:47:19,932;their sons do.
792;00:47:19,966;00:47:22,301;I will have his head.
793;00:47:23,803;00:47:27,706;Thank you for fighting
793;00:47:23,803;00:47:27,706;on my behalf, Lady Stark.
794;00:47:27,740;00:47:29,574;I would have come
794;00:47:27,740;00:47:29,574;to your defense, but--
795;00:47:29,609;00:47:32,276;Take him to the stockades.
796;00:47:32,311;00:47:34,512;Bind him with every chain
796;00:47:32,311;00:47:34,512;you can find!
797;00:47:34,546;00:47:36,046;You've become a real she-wolf
797;00:47:34,546;00:47:36,046;in your later years.
798;00:47:36,081;00:47:38,249;There's not much fish
798;00:47:36,081;00:47:38,249;left in you.
799;00:47:38,283;00:47:39,984;And gag him!
800;00:47:44,255;00:47:47,357;Since when do you light
800;00:47:44,255;00:47:47,357;your own candles?
801;00:47:47,391;00:47:49,726;Since I decided that
801;00:47:47,391;00:47:49,726;I can't stand to look
802;00:47:49,761;00:47:53,296;at any of my handmaidens
802;00:47:49,761;00:47:53,296;for another instant.
803;00:47:54,666;00:47:57,768;How many times can you
803;00:47:54,666;00:47:57,768;read one raven scroll?
804;00:47:57,802;00:48:01,472;Stannis Baratheon's fleet
804;00:47:57,802;00:48:01,472;has been spotted sailing north
805;00:48:01,506;00:48:04,142;past Tarth-- 200 ships.
806;00:48:04,176;00:48:08,313;More than we have.
806;00:48:04,176;00:48:08,313;Yes, that's more than we have.
807;00:48:08,347;00:48:10,715;He'll be at our gates
807;00:48:08,347;00:48:10,715;within five days,
808;00:48:10,749;00:48:12,450;four if he has the wind.
809;00:48:12,485;00:48:15,220;We have strong,
809;00:48:12,485;00:48:15,220;high walls.
810;00:48:15,254;00:48:18,323;We'll rain fire
810;00:48:15,254;00:48:18,323;down on them from above.
811;00:48:18,357;00:48:20,492;Rain fire on them
811;00:48:18,357;00:48:20,492;from above.
812;00:48:20,526;00:48:22,360;You're quoting father,
812;00:48:20,526;00:48:22,360;aren't you?
813;00:48:22,394;00:48:23,828;Why not?
814;00:48:23,863;00:48:25,763;He has a good mind
814;00:48:23,863;00:48:25,763;for strategy, doesn't he?
815;00:48:25,798;00:48:28,566;We call it tactics,
815;00:48:25,798;00:48:28,566;not strategy.
816;00:48:28,600;00:48:30,735;But, yes, he does have
816;00:48:28,600;00:48:30,735;a good mind for it.
817;00:48:30,769;00:48:32,604;The best mind,
817;00:48:30,769;00:48:32,604;some would say.
818;00:48:32,638;00:48:34,606;Sadly, he's not here.
819;00:48:35,574;00:48:37,909;It's just you,
819;00:48:35,574;00:48:37,909;me, and Joffrey,
820;00:48:37,943;00:48:40,111;the Lord
820;00:48:37,943;00:48:40,111;of the Seven Kingdoms
821;00:48:40,146;00:48:41,913;and protector of the realm.
822;00:48:43,683;00:48:45,383;I'm sure you'll make
822;00:48:43,683;00:48:45,383;a point eventually.
823;00:48:45,417;00:48:48,786;He needs to start
823;00:48:45,417;00:48:48,786;acting like a king.
824;00:48:48,821;00:48:51,989;This war you started
824;00:48:48,821;00:48:51,989;is coming to our doorstep.
825;00:48:52,024;00:48:54,325;And if the entire city
825;00:48:52,024;00:48:54,325;wants Joffrey dead--
826;00:48:54,359;00:48:56,627;I'm not the one giving
826;00:48:54,359;00:48:56,627;the boy whores to abuse.
827;00:48:56,661;00:48:58,762;I thought the girls
827;00:48:56,661;00:48:58,762;might help him.
828;00:48:58,796;00:49:01,197;Did you?
828;00:48:58,796;00:49:01,197;I was wrong.
829;00:49:03,933;00:49:06,501;If we can't
829;00:49:03,933;00:49:06,501;control him...
830;00:49:06,536;00:49:08,136;Do you think
830;00:49:06,536;00:49:08,136;I haven't tried?
831;00:49:10,573;00:49:13,375;He doesn't listen to me.
832;00:49:15,078;00:49:18,113;It's hard to put
832;00:49:15,078;00:49:18,113;a leash on a dog
833;00:49:18,147;00:49:20,882;once you've put
833;00:49:18,147;00:49:20,882;a crown on its head.
834;00:49:24,086;00:49:26,921;I always hoped
834;00:49:24,086;00:49:26,921;he'd be like Jaime.
835;00:49:28,991;00:49:31,226;He looks like him...
836;00:49:34,265;00:49:36,966;in a certain light.
837;00:49:39,303;00:49:41,305;The boy is more
837;00:49:39,303;00:49:41,305;Robert than Jaime.
838;00:49:41,339;00:49:45,309;Robert was a drunken fool,
838;00:49:41,339;00:49:45,309;but he didn't enjoy cruelty.
839;00:49:47,245;00:49:50,414;Sometimes I wonder...
840;00:49:50,448;00:49:52,849;What?
841;00:49:52,884;00:49:56,286;If this is the price
842;00:49:56,320;00:50:00,656;for what we've done,
842;00:49:56,320;00:50:00,656;for our sins.
843;00:50:00,690;00:50:02,725;Sins?
844;00:50:02,759;00:50:04,293;The Targaryens--
845;00:50:04,327;00:50:05,906;Wed brother and sister
845;00:50:04,327;00:50:05,906;for hundreds of years,
846;00:50:05,931;00:50:07,931;I know.
847;00:50:09,633;00:50:13,202;That's what Jaime and I would say to
847;00:50:09,633;00:50:13,202;each other in our moments of doubt.
848;00:50:13,237;00:50:17,207;It's what I told Ned Stark when he
848;00:50:13,237;00:50:17,207;was stupid enough to confront me.
849;00:50:19,177;00:50:22,380;Half the Targaryens
849;00:50:19,177;00:50:22,380;went mad, didn't they?
850;00:50:22,414;00:50:23,815;What's the saying?
851;00:50:23,849;00:50:28,386;Every time a Targaryen is born,
851;00:50:23,849;00:50:28,386;the Gods flip a coin.
852;00:50:28,420;00:50:30,922;You've beaten the odds.
853;00:50:30,956;00:50:33,557;Tommen and Myrcella
853;00:50:30,956;00:50:33,557;are good, decent children,
854;00:50:33,592;00:50:35,426;both of them.
855;00:50:37,528;00:50:39,663;( Crying )
856;00:51:02,885;00:51:05,686;Why wait?
856;00:51:02,885;00:51:05,686;We're sworn to the king.
857;00:51:05,721;00:51:08,489;There's not a king.
857;00:51:05,721;00:51:08,489;That's treason.
858;00:51:08,524;00:51:10,691;So is saving
858;00:51:08,524;00:51:10,691;Lannisters, yeah?
859;00:51:10,725;00:51:13,493;Back off, you.
859;00:51:10,725;00:51:13,493;No, I won't.
860;00:51:13,528;00:51:16,029;Your son returns
860;00:51:13,528;00:51:16,029;at dawn, My Lady?
861;00:51:16,064;00:51:17,631;So they say.
862;00:51:17,665;00:51:20,501;Brienne: The Kingslayer
862;00:51:17,665;00:51:20,501;won't last the night.
863;00:51:20,535;00:51:22,869;The more they drink,
863;00:51:20,535;00:51:22,869;the angrier they'll get.
864;00:51:24,105;00:51:26,272;And when the Karstarks
864;00:51:24,105;00:51:26,272;draw their swords...
865;00:51:26,307;00:51:29,742;who wants to die
865;00:51:26,307;00:51:29,742;defending a Lannister?
866;00:51:30,711;00:51:32,346;Come.
867;00:51:48,231;00:51:50,632;I need to be alone
867;00:51:48,231;00:51:50,632;with him.
868;00:51:50,667;00:51:54,536;My Lady, our orders--
868;00:51:50,667;00:51:54,536;your orders, which I just gave you,
869;00:51:54,570;00:51:57,138;are to leave me
869;00:51:54,570;00:51:57,138;alone with him.
870;00:52:02,044;00:52:04,278;Come to say goodbye,
870;00:52:02,044;00:52:04,278;Lady Stark?
871;00:52:04,313;00:52:09,117;I believe it's my last night
871;00:52:04,313;00:52:09,117;in this world.
872;00:52:09,152;00:52:10,585;Is that a woman?
873;00:52:10,620;00:52:13,388;Do you hear them
873;00:52:10,620;00:52:13,388;out there?
874;00:52:13,423;00:52:16,058;They want your head.
875;00:52:16,092;00:52:19,561;Well, old Lord Karstark
875;00:52:16,092;00:52:19,561;doesn't seem to like me.
876;00:52:19,595;00:52:22,831;You strangled his son
876;00:52:19,595;00:52:22,831;with your chains.
877;00:52:22,866;00:52:25,134;Oh, oh.
878;00:52:25,201;00:52:26,802;Was he the one
878;00:52:25,201;00:52:26,802;on guard duty?
879;00:52:26,836;00:52:29,371;( Sighs )
880;00:52:29,406;00:52:31,207;He was in my way.
881;00:52:31,241;00:52:32,841;Any Knight would have
881;00:52:31,241;00:52:32,841;done the same.
882;00:52:32,876;00:52:35,044;You are no Knight.
883;00:52:35,078;00:52:37,647;You have forsaken
883;00:52:35,078;00:52:37,647;every vow you ever took.
884;00:52:37,681;00:52:39,448;So many vows.
885;00:52:39,483;00:52:41,250;They make you swear
885;00:52:39,483;00:52:41,250;and swear.
886;00:52:41,284;00:52:44,085;Defend the king,
886;00:52:41,284;00:52:44,085;obey the king,
887;00:52:44,120;00:52:45,654;obey your father,
