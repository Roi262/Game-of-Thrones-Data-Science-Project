2;00:04:18,104;00:04:19,470;Your Grace.
3;00:04:19,572;00:04:23,207;The trial will be
3;00:04:19,572;00:04:23,207;getting under way soon.
4;00:04:55,641;00:04:57,041;You got my money?
5;00:04:57,143;00:04:59,443;Later.
5;00:04:57,143;00:04:59,443;Go away.
6;00:05:10,723;00:05:12,556;Grand Maester.
7;00:05:52,965;00:05:55,432;Ser Loras Tyrell.
8;00:05:57,270;00:06:00,004;Are you prepared to stand trial
9;00:06:00,106;00:06:03,807;and profess your guilt or
9;00:06:00,106;00:06:03,807;innocence before the Seven?
10;00:06:06,412;00:06:08,812;There'll be no need for a trial.
11;00:06:11,317;00:06:13,717;I confess before the Seven
12;00:06:13,819;00:06:15,819;and freely admit to my crimes.
13;00:06:17,323;00:06:20,057;To which crimes
13;00:06:17,323;00:06:20,057;will you be confessing?
14;00:06:20,159;00:06:22,493;All of them.
15;00:06:24,230;00:06:25,930;I lay with other men
16;00:06:26,032;00:06:29,466;including the traitor
16;00:06:26,032;00:06:29,466;Renly Baratheon.
17;00:06:32,972;00:06:35,739;I perjured myself before the gods.
18;00:06:35,841;00:06:38,142;I am guilty of depravity...
19;00:06:39,645;00:06:41,645;dishonesty,
20;00:06:41,747;00:06:43,214;profligacy,
21;00:06:43,316;00:06:46,183;and arrogance.
22;00:06:46,285;00:06:47,718;I see that now.
23;00:06:50,089;00:06:52,323;I humble myself before the Seven
24;00:06:52,425;00:06:55,826;and accept whatever punishment
24;00:06:52,425;00:06:55,826;the gods deem just.
25;00:06:57,863;00:07:02,733;The gods' judgment is fierce,
26;00:07:02,835;00:07:05,369;but also fair.
27;00:07:05,471;00:07:08,839;The Warrior punishes those
27;00:07:05,471;00:07:08,839;who believe themselves
28;00:07:08,941;00:07:11,208;beyond the reach of justice.
29;00:07:12,712;00:07:15,779;But the Mother shows her mercy
30;00:07:15,881;00:07:19,683;to those who kneel before her.
31;00:07:27,727;00:07:30,427;I take full
31;00:07:27,727;00:07:30,427;responsibility for my many sins
32;00:07:30,529;00:07:33,030;and unburden myself of my desires.
33;00:07:36,502;00:07:39,436;My only remaining wish
34;00:07:39,538;00:07:42,139;is to devote my life to the Seven.
35;00:07:42,241;00:07:45,309;May I be a living example
35;00:07:42,241;00:07:45,309;of their grace
36;00:07:45,411;00:07:48,078;for others to witness.
37;00:07:49,649;00:07:53,117;You understand fully
38;00:07:53,219;00:07:55,052;what this means?
39;00:07:55,154;00:07:56,654;I do.
40;00:07:59,225;00:08:01,358;I will abandon the Tyrell name
41;00:08:01,460;00:08:04,495;and all that goes with it.
42;00:08:04,597;00:08:08,365;I will renounce my lordship
42;00:08:04,597;00:08:08,365;and my claims on Highgarden.
43;00:08:12,004;00:08:14,238;I will never marry
44;00:08:14,340;00:08:16,740;and I will never father children.
45;00:08:20,313;00:08:22,279;Brother Loras...
46;00:08:22,381;00:08:27,151;...I ask you to dedicate
46;00:08:22,381;00:08:27,151;your life to the seven gods.
47;00:08:31,390;00:08:34,191;Will you fight to defend your faith
48;00:08:34,293;00:08:36,727;against heretics and apostates?
49;00:08:36,829;00:08:38,329;I will.
50;00:09:07,526;00:09:08,692;No, I can't let them--
51;00:09:08,794;00:09:11,762;Faith is the way, Father.
52;00:09:34,320;00:09:35,486;All right.
53;00:09:36,722;00:09:38,422;I'm ready.
54;00:09:45,865;00:09:48,365;I have to go.
54;00:09:45,865;00:09:48,365;I'm--
55;00:09:48,467;00:09:50,401;I'm late for the trial.
56;00:10:03,549;00:10:05,649;You mutilated him.
57;00:10:05,751;00:10:07,651;You gave me your word.
58;00:10:07,753;00:10:10,120;And I have kept my word.
59;00:10:10,222;00:10:12,990;Once the queen mother's
59;00:10:10,222;00:10:12,990;trial is concluded,
60;00:10:13,092;00:10:15,125;Brother Loras is free to leave.
61;00:10:15,227;00:10:17,127;And where is the queen mother?
62;00:10:17,229;00:10:20,497;Her litter never left the Red Keep.
63;00:10:20,599;00:10:24,535;It appears the queen mother doesn't
63;00:10:20,599;00:10:24,535;wish to attend her own trial.
64;00:10:26,939;00:10:29,606;Go to the Red Keep
64;00:10:26,939;00:10:29,606;and show her the way.
65;00:10:56,469;00:10:58,235;Get the others.
66;00:11:40,279;00:11:42,212;Where's the king?
67;00:11:45,184;00:11:47,117;Elsewhere, I'm afraid.
68;00:11:47,219;00:11:48,852;What's the meaning of this?
69;00:11:48,954;00:11:50,821;I was told that--
70;00:11:50,923;00:11:52,389;ah.
71;00:11:52,491;00:11:54,591;I have more important
71;00:11:52,491;00:11:54,591;things to do with my time
72;00:11:54,693;00:11:56,059;than waste them
72;00:11:54,693;00:11:56,059;in the presence--
73;00:11:56,161;00:11:58,829;Please, Grand Maester.
73;00:11:56,161;00:11:58,829;I bear you no ill will.
74;00:12:00,299;00:12:02,633;Please forgive me if you can.
75;00:12:34,400;00:12:36,533;This pains me, my lord.
76;00:12:36,635;00:12:38,702;Whatever your faults,
76;00:12:36,635;00:12:38,702;you do not deserve
77;00:12:38,804;00:12:41,772;to die alone in such
77;00:12:38,804;00:12:41,772;a cold, dark place.
78;00:12:41,874;00:12:45,609;But sometimes before
78;00:12:41,874;00:12:45,609;we can usher in the new,
79;00:12:45,711;00:12:49,846;the old must be put to rest.
80;00:13:31,023;00:13:34,124;The longer you wait,
80;00:13:31,023;00:13:34,124;the worse it'll be for you.
81;00:14:01,086;00:14:03,120;What are you doing?
82;00:15:10,489;00:15:12,556;There's something wrong.
83;00:15:12,658;00:15:15,125;You have nothing to fear, Your Grace.
84;00:15:15,227;00:15:17,094;The trial will begin shortly.
85;00:15:17,196;00:15:19,896;Cersei is not here.
85;00:15:17,196;00:15:19,896;Tommen is not here.
86;00:15:19,998;00:15:21,358;Why do you think they're not here?
87;00:15:21,433;00:15:23,266;If the accused is not here,
88;00:15:23,368;00:15:25,435;she will be tried regardless.
89;00:15:25,537;00:15:27,771;We cannot escape
89;00:15:25,537;00:15:27,771;the justice of the gods--
90;00:15:27,873;00:15:30,507;Forget about the bloody gods and
90;00:15:27,873;00:15:30,507;listen to what I'm telling you.
91;00:15:30,609;00:15:34,044;Cersei understands the
91;00:15:30,609;00:15:34,044;consequences of her absence
92;00:15:34,146;00:15:35,912;and she is absent anyway,
93;00:15:36,014;00:15:39,883;which means she does not intend
93;00:15:36,014;00:15:39,883;to suffer those consequences.
94;00:15:39,985;00:15:43,854;The trial can wait.
94;00:15:39,985;00:15:43,854;We all need to leave.
95;00:16:09,648;00:16:11,748;We all need to leave now.
96;00:16:16,388;00:16:19,156;Loras.
97;00:16:19,258;00:16:21,424;Stay with me.
98;00:16:33,872;00:16:36,673;Let me through.
98;00:16:33,872;00:16:36,673;Let me through.
99;00:16:38,544;00:16:40,844;Get out of my way.
100;00:16:49,154;00:16:51,087;Let us through.
101;00:18:20,545;00:18:22,579;Confess.
102;00:18:24,750;00:18:26,716;Confess.
103;00:18:31,056;00:18:33,056;No.
103;00:18:31,056;00:18:33,056;Confess.
104;00:18:42,668;00:18:45,502;Confess.
104;00:18:42,668;00:18:45,502;It felt good.
105;00:18:45,604;00:18:49,306;Beating me, starving me,
106;00:18:49,408;00:18:52,309;frightening me, humiliating me.
107;00:18:55,314;00:18:58,081;You didn't do it because
107;00:18:55,314;00:18:58,081;you cared about my atonement.
108;00:18:58,183;00:19:01,318;You did it because it felt good.
109;00:19:01,420;00:19:03,653;I understand.
110;00:19:03,755;00:19:06,923;I do things because they feel good.
111;00:19:09,895;00:19:13,229;I drink because it feels good.
112;00:19:13,332;00:19:17,434;I killed my husband because it
112;00:19:13,332;00:19:17,434;felt good to be rid of him.
113;00:19:20,772;00:19:25,742;I fuck my brother because it feels
113;00:19:20,772;00:19:25,742;good to feel him inside me.
114;00:19:25,844;00:19:27,911;I lie about fucking my brother...
115;00:19:29,948;00:19:33,950;because it feels good to keep our
115;00:19:29,948;00:19:33,950;son safe from hateful hypocrites.
116;00:19:36,755;00:19:38,521;I killed your High Sparrow...
117;00:19:40,492;00:19:42,659;and all his little sparrows...
118;00:19:44,329;00:19:47,597;all his septons, all his septas,
119;00:19:47,699;00:19:50,533;all his filthy soldiers,
120;00:19:50,635;00:19:53,837;because it felt good
120;00:19:50,635;00:19:53,837;to watch them burn.
121;00:19:55,674;00:19:59,509;It felt good to imagine
121;00:19:55,674;00:19:59,509;their shock and their pain.
122;00:19:59,611;00:20:02,946;No thought has ever
122;00:19:59,611;00:20:02,946;given me greater joy.
123;00:20:08,653;00:20:12,155;Even confessing feels good
123;00:20:08,653;00:20:12,155;under the right circumstances.
124;00:20:18,330;00:20:20,363;You've always been quiet.
125;00:20:28,340;00:20:31,307;I said my face would be the last
125;00:20:28,340;00:20:31,307;thing you saw before you died.
126;00:20:31,410;00:20:33,476;Do you remember?
127;00:20:33,578;00:20:35,545;Good.
128;00:20:37,816;00:20:40,083;I'm glad to see your face.
129;00:20:42,988;00:20:44,921;I'm ready to meet the gods.
130;00:20:45,023;00:20:46,356;What?
131;00:20:48,360;00:20:50,293;Now?
132;00:20:50,395;00:20:51,861;Today?
133;00:20:54,933;00:20:57,367;You're not going to die today.
134;00:20:59,871;00:21:02,338;You're not going to die
134;00:20:59,871;00:21:02,338;for quite a while.
135;00:21:04,776;00:21:06,743;Ser Gregor.
136;00:21:10,782;00:21:13,049;This is Ser Gregor Clegane.
137;00:21:13,151;00:21:15,752;He's quiet, too.
138;00:21:26,865;00:21:28,498;Your gods have forsaken you.
139;00:21:29,734;00:21:31,868;This is your god now.
140;00:21:43,081;00:21:44,881;No.
141;00:21:45,984;00:21:47,150;No.
142;00:21:48,687;00:21:51,921;Shame.
143;00:21:52,023;00:21:55,258;Shame.
144;00:21:55,360;00:21:59,062;Shame.
145;00:22:03,969;00:22:06,469;I'm very sorry, Your Grace.
146;00:22:08,006;00:22:09,772;Very sorry.
147;00:22:53,552;00:22:55,919;For House Lannister!
148;00:22:56,021;00:22:57,954;Hear me roar!
149;00:23:03,595;00:23:05,795;For House Frey!
150;00:23:05,897;00:23:08,965;We stand together!
151;00:23:09,067;00:23:11,935;May we stand together
151;00:23:09,067;00:23:11,935;through the centuries,
152;00:23:12,037;00:23:14,504;good friends to the last.
153;00:23:14,606;00:23:18,641;And when we drive our swords
153;00:23:14,606;00:23:18,641;through our enemies' hearts,
154;00:23:18,743;00:23:22,545;may we speak the words
154;00:23:18,743;00:23:22,545;of our alliance,
155;00:23:22,647;00:23:26,049;The Freys and the Lannisters
156;00:23:26,151;00:23:28,351;send their regards.
157;00:23:45,670;00:23:48,171;You don't even have
157;00:23:45,670;00:23:48,171;to do anything, do you?
158;00:23:49,574;00:23:51,841;You just sit there,
158;00:23:49,574;00:23:51,841;a rich slab of beef,
159;00:23:51,943;00:23:53,376;and all the birds come pecking.
160;00:23:53,478;00:23:55,878;You're welcome to her.
160;00:23:53,478;00:23:55,878;She doesn't want me.
161;00:23:55,981;00:23:58,381;She wants your golden
161;00:23:55,981;00:23:58,381;fingers up her twat.
162;00:24:00,252;00:24:02,352;Those two have their eyes on you.
163;00:24:04,522;00:24:06,222;They have their eyes on you, cunt.
164;00:24:06,324;00:24:08,124;Not my type.
165;00:24:08,226;00:24:09,792;Not blonde enough?
166;00:24:12,264;00:24:15,698;Ladies, have you met
166;00:24:12,264;00:24:15,698;Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,
167;00:24:15,800;00:24:17,967;hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay?
168;00:24:18,069;00:24:20,436;There you go.
168;00:24:18,069;00:24:20,436;Maybe I'm not in the mood.
169;00:24:23,708;00:24:25,241;Fuck it.
170;00:24:25,343;00:24:28,511;No need to call me ser just
170;00:24:25,343;00:24:28,511;because I'm an anointed knight.
171;00:24:33,818;00:24:36,252;This came together rather well.
172;00:24:37,989;00:24:40,156;Your father would be pleased.
173;00:24:40,258;00:24:41,924;I'm sure he would be.
174;00:24:44,562;00:24:47,397;Edmure is back in a cell.
175;00:24:47,499;00:24:51,134;Can't go killing my son by law.
175;00:24:47,499;00:24:51,134;It wouldn't be right.
176;00:24:51,236;00:24:53,403;Give the family a bad name.
177;00:24:56,875;00:25:00,810;So the famous Blackfish
177;00:24:56,875;00:25:00,810;killed by foot soldiers, eh?
178;00:25:00,912;00:25:03,813;Legendary warrior, everyone said.
179;00:25:05,283;00:25:07,583;Have you done much fighting
179;00:25:05,283;00:25:07,583;yourself, Lord Frey?
180;00:25:07,686;00:25:10,219;I'm a bit old for all that.
181;00:25:10,322;00:25:13,022;No, but back in your day.
182;00:25:13,124;00:25:16,059;The purpose of fighting
183;00:25:16,161;00:25:19,362;is defeating your enemies, isn't it?
184;00:25:19,464;00:25:21,464;I've defeated mine.
185;00:25:21,566;00:25:25,268;Riverrun belonged to House
185;00:25:21,566;00:25:25,268;Tully for a thousand years.
186;00:25:25,370;00:25:26,936;Now it's mine.
187;00:25:27,038;00:25:29,339;What do you call that?
188;00:25:29,441;00:25:30,707;Victory.
189;00:25:30,809;00:25:33,309;Yes, you're a great conqueror.
190;00:25:34,913;00:25:38,681;Go on, mock me, boy.
190;00:25:34,913;00:25:38,681;You think I mind?
191;00:25:38,783;00:25:41,517;The Tullys mocked me for years.
192;00:25:41,619;00:25:43,786;The Starks mocked me.
193;00:25:43,888;00:25:45,355;Where are they now?
194;00:25:45,457;00:25:47,924;You talk about war
194;00:25:45,457;00:25:47,924;as if you're an expert,
195;00:25:48,026;00:25:50,326;but the one battle
195;00:25:48,026;00:25:50,326;I remember you fighting,
196;00:25:50,428;00:25:53,329;you were captured by Robb
196;00:25:50,428;00:25:53,329;Stark, the Young Wolf.
197;00:25:53,431;00:25:56,332;But it doesn't matter.
198;00:25:56,434;00:25:59,769;Here we are now, two kingslayers.
199;00:25:59,871;00:26:03,740;We know what it's like to
199;00:25:59,871;00:26:03,740;have them grovel to our faces
200;00:26:03,842;00:26:06,843;and snigger behind our backs.
201;00:26:06,945;00:26:08,511;We don't mind, do we?
202;00:26:08,613;00:26:12,582;Fear is a marvelous thing.
203;00:26:12,684;00:26:14,283;They don't fear the Freys, though.
204;00:26:14,386;00:26:17,120;They fear the Lannisters.
205;00:26:17,222;00:26:19,589;We gave you the Riverlands
205;00:26:17,222;00:26:19,589;to hold the Riverlands.
206;00:26:19,691;00:26:22,125;If we have to ride north
206;00:26:19,691;00:26:22,125;and take them back for you
207;00:26:22,227;00:26:24,627;every time you lose them,
208;00:26:24,729;00:26:26,696;why do we need you?
209;00:26:48,386;00:26:50,052;Show me.
210;00:26:52,857;00:26:54,824;Your Grace,
210;00:26:52,857;00:26:54,824;there's no need--
211;00:26:54,926;00:26:56,292;Show me.
212;00:27:09,207;00:27:12,608;What are your thoughts
212;00:27:09,207;00:27:12,608;concerning the king's funeral?
213;00:27:12,710;00:27:15,378;As the Sept of Baelor
213;00:27:12,710;00:27:15,378;is no longer an option,
214;00:27:15,480;00:27:19,248;perhaps a ceremony
214;00:27:15,480;00:27:19,248;in the throne room?
215;00:27:20,718;00:27:23,853;He should be with his grandfather,
216;00:27:23,955;00:27:26,789;his brother, his sister.
217;00:27:29,227;00:27:31,894;Burn him
218;00:27:31,996;00:27:34,964;and bury his ashes
218;00:27:31,996;00:27:34,964;where the sept once stood.
219;00:27:47,579;00:27:49,912;Whoa, whoa.
220;00:28:32,690;00:28:34,056;Hello.
221;00:28:40,832;00:28:44,534;From Lord Commander Snow
221;00:28:40,832;00:28:44,534;at Castle Black.
222;00:28:59,150;00:29:01,417;I'm--
223;00:29:01,519;00:29:03,019;I'm to be the new maester.
224;00:29:18,369;00:29:19,502;Oh.
225;00:29:19,604;00:29:22,004;According to our records,
226;00:29:22,106;00:29:23,873;Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.
227;00:29:25,276;00:29:27,009;He died.
228;00:29:27,111;00:29:29,679;We received no report from
228;00:29:27,111;00:29:29,679;the maester at Castle Black.
229;00:29:29,781;00:29:32,915;Maester Aemon became quite ill
229;00:29:29,781;00:29:32,915;shortly after the election.
230;00:29:33,017;00:29:35,284;He's since passed away.
231;00:29:37,488;00:29:39,422;Which is why I'm here.
232;00:29:42,794;00:29:44,627;This is irregular.
233;00:29:44,729;00:29:49,398;Yes, well, I suppose
233;00:29:44,729;00:29:49,398;that life is irregular.
234;00:30:00,979;00:30:05,081;The archmaester will discuss
234;00:30:00,979;00:30:05,081;these irregularities with you.
235;00:30:07,652;00:30:10,686;In the meantime, you are
235;00:30:07,652;00:30:10,686;permitted to use the library.
236;00:30:10,788;00:30:12,655;Follow me.
237;00:30:15,627;00:30:17,627;No women or children.
238;00:32:11,876;00:32:14,176;When we had feasts,
239;00:32:14,278;00:32:16,545;our family would sit up here...
240;00:32:18,549;00:32:20,449;and I'd sit down there.
241;00:32:22,787;00:32:25,354;Could have been worse, Jon Snow.
242;00:32:25,456;00:32:27,223;You had a family.
243;00:32:27,325;00:32:28,491;You had feasts.
244;00:32:30,661;00:32:33,796;Aye, you're right.
244;00:32:30,661;00:32:33,796;I was luckier than most.
245;00:32:49,247;00:32:50,913;What is that?
246;00:32:52,550;00:32:54,483;Tell him.
247;00:32:57,522;00:32:59,722;Tell him who it belonged to.
248;00:33:04,595;00:33:06,195;The Princess Shireen.
249;00:33:06,297;00:33:08,597;Tell him what you did to her.
250;00:33:10,468;00:33:11,767;Tell him!
251;00:33:18,476;00:33:20,176;We burned her at the stake.
252;00:33:33,324;00:33:35,658;Why?
253;00:33:35,760;00:33:38,861;The army was trapped.
253;00:33:35,760;00:33:38,861;The horses were dying.
254;00:33:38,963;00:33:42,031;It was the only way.
254;00:33:38,963;00:33:42,031;You burned a little girl alive!
255;00:33:42,133;00:33:43,566;I only do what my Lord commands.
256;00:33:43,668;00:33:46,802;If he commands you to burn
256;00:33:43,668;00:33:46,802;children, your Lord is evil.
257;00:33:50,107;00:33:51,807;We are standing here because of him.
258;00:33:53,311;00:33:56,579;Jon Snow is alive
258;00:33:53,311;00:33:56,579;because the Lord willed it.
259;00:33:56,681;00:34:00,282;I loved that girl
259;00:33:56,681;00:34:00,282;like she was my own.
260;00:34:00,384;00:34:03,686;She was good. She was kind.
260;00:34:00,384;00:34:03,686;And you killed her!
261;00:34:05,890;00:34:07,356;So did her father.
262;00:34:09,660;00:34:11,126;So did her mother.
263;00:34:13,331;00:34:15,564;Her own blood knew
263;00:34:13,331;00:34:15,564;it was the only way.
264;00:34:15,666;00:34:18,267;The only way for what?
265;00:34:18,369;00:34:19,869;They all died anyway.
266;00:34:21,739;00:34:23,739;You told everyone
266;00:34:21,739;00:34:23,739;Stannis was the one.
267;00:34:23,841;00:34:26,175;You had him believing it,
267;00:34:23,841;00:34:26,175;all of them fooled.
268;00:34:26,277;00:34:28,744;And you lied.
268;00:34:26,277;00:34:28,744;I didn't lie.
269;00:34:30,481;00:34:31,814;I was wrong.
270;00:34:31,916;00:34:35,150;Aye, you were wrong.
271;00:34:35,253;00:34:38,888;How many died because you were wrong?
272;00:34:43,861;00:34:47,763;I ask your leave to execute
272;00:34:43,861;00:34:47,763;this woman for murder.
273;00:34:47,865;00:34:49,665;She admits to the crime.
274;00:34:52,169;00:34:54,570;Do you have anything
274;00:34:52,169;00:34:54,570;to say for yourself?
275;00:34:56,440;00:34:59,174;I've been ready
275;00:34:56,440;00:34:59,174;to die for many years.
276;00:35:00,978;00:35:04,013;If the Lord was done with
276;00:35:00,978;00:35:04,013;me, so be it, but he's not.
277;00:35:04,115;00:35:07,316;You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow.
278;00:35:07,418;00:35:10,686;You know the great war
278;00:35:07,418;00:35:10,686;is still to come.
279;00:35:10,788;00:35:13,756;You know the army of the
279;00:35:10,788;00:35:13,756;dead will be upon us soon.
280;00:35:14,992;00:35:17,559;And you know I can
280;00:35:14,992;00:35:17,559;help you win that war.
281;00:35:31,842;00:35:33,709;Ride south today.
282;00:35:35,212;00:35:37,112;If you return to the North,
283;00:35:37,214;00:35:39,815;I'll have you hanged as a murderer.
284;00:35:57,568;00:36:00,169;If you ever come back this way,
285;00:36:00,271;00:36:02,638;I will execute you myself.
286;00:36:34,638;00:36:37,439;I'm having the lord's
286;00:36:34,638;00:36:37,439;chamber prepared for you.
287;00:36:39,176;00:36:41,210;Mother and Father's room?
288;00:36:42,680;00:36:44,513;You should take it.
289;00:36:45,916;00:36:47,883;I'm not a Stark.
290;00:36:47,985;00:36:50,386;You are to me.
291;00:36:54,058;00:36:55,724;You're the Lady of Winterfell.
292;00:36:55,826;00:36:59,728;You deserve it. We're
292;00:36:55,826;00:36:59,728;standing here because of you.
293;00:36:59,830;00:37:03,332;The battle was lost until the
293;00:36:59,830;00:37:03,332;Knights of the Vale rode in.
294;00:37:03,434;00:37:05,634;They came because of you.
295;00:37:09,640;00:37:12,574;You told me Lord Baelish
295;00:37:09,640;00:37:12,574;sold you to the Boltons.
296;00:37:12,676;00:37:14,443;He did.
296;00:37:12,676;00:37:14,443;And you trust him?
297;00:37:14,545;00:37:18,180;Only a fool would trust Littlefinger.
298;00:37:21,318;00:37:24,086;I should have told you about him,
299;00:37:24,188;00:37:27,523;about the Knights of the Vale.
300;00:37:27,625;00:37:29,091;I'm sorry.
301;00:37:40,404;00:37:42,371;We need to trust each other.
302;00:37:42,473;00:37:45,474;We can't fight a war
302;00:37:42,473;00:37:45,474;amongst ourselves.
303;00:37:45,576;00:37:48,077;We have so many enemies now.
304;00:38:04,328;00:38:06,361;Jon.
305;00:38:06,464;00:38:09,898;A raven came from the Citadel.
306;00:38:10,000;00:38:11,900;A white raven.
307;00:38:14,605;00:38:16,138;Winter is here.
308;00:38:28,419;00:38:31,553;Well, Father always
308;00:38:28,419;00:38:31,553;promised, didn't he?
309;00:38:45,636;00:38:48,804;The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne,
310;00:38:48,906;00:38:51,006;he was assassinated.
311;00:38:51,108;00:38:53,675;100 red scorpions, was it?
312;00:38:53,777;00:38:56,278;You have nothing to fear
312;00:38:53,777;00:38:56,278;from us, Lady Olenna.
313;00:38:56,380;00:38:58,514;You murder your own prince,
314;00:38:58,616;00:39:00,349;but you expect me to trust you?
315;00:39:00,451;00:39:03,418;We invited you to Dorne
315;00:39:00,451;00:39:03,418;because we needed your help.
316;00:39:03,521;00:39:05,787;You came to Dorne because
316;00:39:03,521;00:39:05,787;you needed our help.
317;00:39:05,890;00:39:08,390;What is your name again?
318;00:39:08,492;00:39:09,858;Barbaro?
319;00:39:09,960;00:39:11,560;Obara.
320;00:39:11,662;00:39:14,796;Obara. You look like
320;00:39:11,662;00:39:14,796;an angry little boy.
321;00:39:14,899;00:39:17,533;Don't presume to tell me what I need.
322;00:39:17,635;00:39:20,969;Forgive my sister. What she
322;00:39:17,635;00:39:20,969;lacks in diplomacy, she makes--
323;00:39:21,071;00:39:24,573;Do shut up, dear.
323;00:39:21,071;00:39:24,573;Anything from you?
324;00:39:24,675;00:39:26,575;No? Good.
325;00:39:26,677;00:39:29,077;Let the grown women speak.
326;00:39:29,180;00:39:32,881;The Lannisters have declared
326;00:39:29,180;00:39:32,881;war on House Tyrell.
327;00:39:32,983;00:39:35,951;They have declared war on Dorne.
328;00:39:36,053;00:39:39,688;We must be allies now
328;00:39:36,053;00:39:39,688;if we wish to survive.
329;00:39:40,991;00:39:43,959;Cersei stole the future from me.
330;00:39:44,061;00:39:45,827;She killed my son.
331;00:39:45,930;00:39:47,963;She killed my grandson.
332;00:39:48,065;00:39:51,266;She killed my granddaughter.
333;00:39:51,368;00:39:54,203;Survival is not what I'm after now.
334;00:39:54,305;00:39:56,471;You're absolutely right.
335;00:39:56,574;00:39:59,141;I chose the wrong words.
336;00:39:59,243;00:40:01,743;It is not survival I offer.
337;00:40:01,845;00:40:04,179;It is your heart's desire.
338;00:40:06,016;00:40:09,218;And what is my heart's desire?
339;00:40:10,788;00:40:13,021;Vengeance.
340;00:40:13,123;00:40:14,223;Justice.
341;00:40:17,962;00:40:19,828;Fire and blood.
342;00:40:26,303;00:40:29,104;Your ships are nearly ready.
343;00:40:29,206;00:40:31,506;I saw them painting the sails.
344;00:40:34,945;00:40:38,747;I'm curious to see how the
344;00:40:34,945;00:40:38,747;Dothraki do on the poison water.
345;00:40:38,849;00:40:40,749;You're not coming with us.
346;00:40:43,120;00:40:46,355;New strategy?
347;00:40:46,457;00:40:49,658;You want the Second Sons to
347;00:40:46,457;00:40:49,658;attack from the west coast?
348;00:40:49,760;00:40:52,361;If we take Casterly Rock,
349;00:40:52,463;00:40:56,031;the Lannisters will have nowhere to
349;00:40:52,463;00:40:56,031;run when you hit King's Landing.
350;00:40:56,133;00:40:58,066;You're not going to Westeros.
351;00:40:58,168;00:41:01,103;You're staying here
351;00:40:58,168;00:41:01,103;with the Second Sons.
352;00:41:01,205;00:41:03,839;There's finally peace in Meereen.
353;00:41:03,941;00:41:07,276;You will keep the peace while the
353;00:41:03,941;00:41:07,276;people choose their own leaders.
354;00:41:08,579;00:41:10,379;Fuck Meereen.
355;00:41:10,481;00:41:12,381;Fuck the people.
356;00:41:12,483;00:41:14,750;I'm here for you, not them.
357;00:41:14,852;00:41:16,518;You promised me.
358;00:41:16,620;00:41:19,554;My sword is yours.
358;00:41:16,620;00:41:19,554;My life is yours.
359;00:41:19,657;00:41:22,758;This is what I command.
360;00:41:22,860;00:41:25,861;If I'm going to rule in Westeros,
361;00:41:25,963;00:41:28,463;I'll need to make alliances.
362;00:41:28,565;00:41:31,933;The best way to make
362;00:41:28,565;00:41:31,933;alliances is with marriage.
363;00:41:35,272;00:41:37,105;Who are you marrying this time?
364;00:41:37,207;00:41:40,575;I don't know.
364;00:41:37,207;00:41:40,575;Maybe no one.
365;00:41:40,678;00:41:43,779;But you need to lure all the
365;00:41:40,678;00:41:43,779;noble houses to the table?
366;00:41:43,881;00:41:45,847;Are you a queen or fish bait?
367;00:41:48,285;00:41:51,253;I can't bring a lover to Westeros.
368;00:41:51,355;00:41:53,588;A king wouldn't think twice about it.
369;00:41:53,691;00:41:56,591;So that's what you want?
369;00:41:53,691;00:41:56,591;To be my mistress?
370;00:41:56,694;00:41:59,995;I'm not proud. I don't care
370;00:41:56,694;00:41:59,995;what perfumed aristocrat
371;00:42:00,097;00:42:02,197;sits beside you in the throne room.
372;00:42:02,299;00:42:05,334;I don't want a crown.
372;00:42:02,299;00:42:05,334;I want you.
373;00:42:12,309;00:42:14,509;I love you.
374;00:42:14,611;00:42:17,079;And I make you happy.
375;00:42:17,181;00:42:19,047;You know I do.
376;00:42:21,285;00:42:24,986;Bring me with you.
376;00:42:21,285;00:42:24,986;Let me fight for you.
377;00:42:32,596;00:42:33,862;I can't.
378;00:42:43,607;00:42:45,340;The dwarf told you to do this?
379;00:42:45,442;00:42:47,109;No one tells me to do anything.
380;00:42:47,211;00:42:50,379;Clever fellow.
380;00:42:47,211;00:42:50,379;Can't argue with his logic.
381;00:42:50,481;00:42:52,214;I'm no use to you over there.
382;00:42:52,316;00:42:53,582;Don't get angry.
383;00:42:53,684;00:42:56,852;I'm not angry.
383;00:42:53,684;00:42:56,852;I'm full of self-pity.
384;00:42:56,954;00:42:58,553;Who comes after you?
385;00:42:58,655;00:43:01,823;Who can ever follow Daenerys
385;00:42:58,655;00:43:01,823;Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?
386;00:43:01,925;00:43:04,192;A great number of women, I imagine.
387;00:43:10,401;00:43:12,234;Specific orders will be left for you
388;00:43:12,336;00:43:15,270;regarding the welfare of Meereen
388;00:43:12,336;00:43:15,270;and the Bay of Dragons.
389;00:43:15,372;00:43:17,172;Bay of Dragons?
390;00:43:17,274;00:43:20,275;We can't call it Slaver's
390;00:43:17,274;00:43:20,275;Bay anymore, can we?
391;00:43:23,280;00:43:26,581;You'll get that throne you
391;00:43:23,280;00:43:26,581;want so badly, I'm sure of it.
392;00:43:27,918;00:43:30,118;I hope it brings you happiness.
393;00:43:35,192;00:43:37,793;I pity the lords of Westeros.
394;00:43:37,895;00:43:40,061;They have no idea
394;00:43:37,895;00:43:40,061;what's coming for them.
395;00:43:40,164;00:43:44,099;Farewell, Daario Naharis.
396;00:44:02,786;00:44:05,086;How did he take it?
397;00:44:05,189;00:44:07,255;No tears.
398;00:44:09,326;00:44:11,960;I know it was hard for you.
399;00:44:12,062;00:44:14,095;You turned away a man
399;00:44:12,062;00:44:14,095;who truly loves you
400;00:44:14,198;00:44:17,098;because he would have been a
400;00:44:14,198;00:44:17,098;liability in the Seven Kingdoms.
401;00:44:19,670;00:44:23,371;That's the kind of self-sacrifice
401;00:44:19,670;00:44:23,371;that makes for a good ruler,
402;00:44:23,474;00:44:25,640;if it's any consolation.
403;00:44:28,545;00:44:30,345;It's not.
404;00:44:30,447;00:44:32,747;No, I suppose not.
405;00:44:32,850;00:44:34,382;I'm terrible at consoling.
406;00:44:34,485;00:44:36,785;Yes, you really are.
407;00:44:39,957;00:44:44,159;All right, how about the fact
407;00:44:39,957;00:44:44,159;that this is actually happening?
408;00:44:45,662;00:44:48,530;You have your armies,
408;00:44:45,662;00:44:48,530;you have your ships,
409;00:44:48,632;00:44:50,632;you have your dragons.
410;00:44:50,734;00:44:52,701;Everything you've ever wanted
411;00:44:52,803;00:44:55,704;since you were old enough
411;00:44:52,803;00:44:55,704;to want anything,
412;00:44:55,806;00:44:57,672;it's all yours for the taking.
413;00:44:59,443;00:45:01,376;Are you afraid?
414;00:45:04,548;00:45:06,414;Good.
415;00:45:06,517;00:45:09,251;You're in the great game now.
416;00:45:09,353;00:45:11,920;And the great game's terrifying.
417;00:45:12,022;00:45:14,489;The only people who
417;00:45:12,022;00:45:14,489;aren't afraid of failure
418;00:45:14,591;00:45:16,691;are madmen like your father.
419;00:45:18,795;00:45:20,896;Do you know what frightens me?
420;00:45:22,366;00:45:25,033;I said farewell
420;00:45:22,366;00:45:25,033;to a man who loves me.
421;00:45:26,904;00:45:30,472;A man I thought I cared for.
422;00:45:30,574;00:45:32,541;And I felt nothing.
423;00:45:34,144;00:45:36,044;Just impatient to get on with it.
424;00:45:39,149;00:45:42,217;He wasn't the first to love you
425;00:45:42,319;00:45:44,386;and he won't be the last.
426;00:45:48,292;00:45:53,194;Well, you have completely
426;00:45:48,292;00:45:53,194;failed to console me.
427;00:45:55,766;00:45:58,233;For what it's worth,
427;00:45:55,766;00:45:58,233;I've been a cynic
428;00:45:58,335;00:46:00,468;for as long as I can remember.
429;00:46:00,571;00:46:03,371;Everyone's always asking me
429;00:46:00,571;00:46:03,371;to believe in things--
430;00:46:03,473;00:46:07,208;family, gods, kings, myself.
431;00:46:07,311;00:46:09,144;It was often tempting
432;00:46:09,246;00:46:11,580;until I saw where belief got people.
433;00:46:12,950;00:46:15,550;So I said no, thank you to belief.
434;00:46:15,652;00:46:18,954;And yet here I am.
435;00:46:21,658;00:46:23,925;I believe in you.
436;00:46:25,862;00:46:28,263;It's embarrassing, really.
437;00:46:30,334;00:46:32,133;I'd swear you my sword,
438;00:46:32,235;00:46:35,270;but I don't actually own a sword.
439;00:46:35,372;00:46:37,372;It's your counsel I need.
440;00:46:37,474;00:46:39,908;It's yours.
441;00:46:40,010;00:46:41,443;Now and always.
442;00:46:42,946;00:46:44,779;Good.
443;00:46:46,083;00:46:48,116;I, um...
444;00:46:48,218;00:46:49,985;I had something made for you.
445;00:46:51,688;00:46:54,222;I'm not sure if it's right.
446;00:47:03,533;00:47:06,234;Tyrion Lannister,
447;00:47:06,336;00:47:08,236;I name you Hand of the Queen.
448;00:47:42,472;00:47:45,006;You're not one of mine, are you?
449;00:47:45,108;00:47:46,608;No, my lord.
450;00:47:46,710;00:47:48,376;Didn't think so.
451;00:47:48,478;00:47:50,712;Too pretty.
452;00:47:54,985;00:47:57,786;Where are my damn moron sons?
453;00:47:57,888;00:48:01,623;Black Walder and Lothar
453;00:47:57,888;00:48:01,623;promised to be here by midday.
454;00:48:01,725;00:48:03,558;They're here, my lord.
455;00:48:03,660;00:48:06,961;Well, what are they doing,
455;00:48:03,660;00:48:06,961;trimming their cunt hairs?
456;00:48:07,064;00:48:09,130;Tell them to come here now.
457;00:48:09,232;00:48:11,499;But they're already here, my lord.
458;00:48:15,539;00:48:18,540;Here, my lord.
459;00:48:36,827;00:48:38,860;They weren't easy to carve.
460;00:48:40,530;00:48:42,430;Especially Black Walder.
461;00:48:42,532;00:48:45,100;What...
462;00:48:52,509;00:48:54,175;My name is Arya Stark.
463;00:48:54,277;00:48:55,777;I want you to know that.
464;00:48:55,879;00:48:58,613;The last thing
464;00:48:55,879;00:48:58,613;you're ever going to see
465;00:48:58,715;00:49:01,449;is a Stark smiling down
465;00:48:58,715;00:49:01,449;at you as you die.
466;00:49:56,239;00:49:58,239;Forgive me, my lady...
467;00:49:59,676;00:50:02,677;if you're at prayer.
468;00:50:02,779;00:50:04,779;I'm done with all that.
469;00:50:06,983;00:50:09,517;I came here every day
469;00:50:06,983;00:50:09,517;when I was a girl.
470;00:50:10,813;00:50:14,055;I prayed to be somewhere else.
471;00:50:14,157;00:50:16,257;Back then I only thought
471;00:50:14,157;00:50:16,257;about what I wanted,
472;00:50:16,359;00:50:18,193;never about what I had.
473;00:50:21,965;00:50:23,398;I was a stupid girl.
474;00:50:23,500;00:50:25,433;You were a child.
475;00:50:28,738;00:50:31,206;What do you want?
476;00:50:31,308;00:50:33,675;I thought you knew what I wanted.
477;00:50:33,777;00:50:35,376;I was wrong.
478;00:50:35,478;00:50:38,146;No, you weren't.
479;00:50:41,249;00:50:42,815;Every time I'm faced with a decision,
480;00:50:42,917;00:50:45,151;I close my eyes and see
480;00:50:42,917;00:50:45,151;the same picture.
481;00:50:46,854;00:50:50,256;Whenever I consider
481;00:50:46,854;00:50:50,256;an action, I ask myself
482;00:50:50,358;00:50:54,493;will this action help to make
482;00:50:50,358;00:50:54,493;this picture a reality?
483;00:50:56,464;00:50:59,232;Pull it out of my mind
484;00:50:59,334;00:51:01,167;and into the world?
485;00:51:03,271;00:51:06,239;And I only act if the answer is yes.
486;00:51:09,010;00:51:13,579;A picture of me on the Iron Throne...
487;00:51:16,384;00:51:18,284;and you by my side.
488;00:51:28,363;00:51:30,263;It's a pretty picture.
489;00:51:35,803;00:51:39,305;News of this battle will spread
489;00:51:35,803;00:51:39,305;quickly through the Seven Kingdoms.
490;00:51:39,407;00:51:42,908;I've declared for House
490;00:51:39,407;00:51:42,908;Stark for all to hear.
491;00:51:43,011;00:51:45,478;You've declared for other
491;00:51:43,011;00:51:45,478;houses before, Lord Baelish.
492;00:51:45,580;00:51:48,281;It's never stopped you
492;00:51:45,580;00:51:48,281;from serving yourself.
493;00:51:48,383;00:51:50,583;The past is gone for good.
494;00:51:50,685;00:51:52,752;You can sit here
494;00:51:50,685;00:51:52,752;mourning its departure
495;00:51:52,854;00:51:55,788;or you can prepare for the future.
496;00:51:55,890;00:51:58,357;You, my love,
497;00:51:58,459;00:52:01,093;are the future of House Stark.
498;00:52:01,195;00:52:04,864;Who should the North rally behind?
499;00:52:04,966;00:52:07,633;A trueborn daughter
499;00:52:04,966;00:52:07,633;of Ned and Catelyn Stark
500;00:52:07,735;00:52:09,635;born here at Winterfell
501;00:52:09,737;00:52:12,938;or a motherless bastard
501;00:52:09,737;00:52:12,938;born in the south?
502;00:52:39,400;00:52:41,634;This is where I leave you.
503;00:52:41,736;00:52:43,536;You're not coming with us?
504;00:52:45,006;00:52:48,407;The Wall is not just ice and stone.
505;00:52:48,509;00:52:51,677;Ancient spells were carved
505;00:52:48,509;00:52:51,677;into its foundations.
506;00:52:53,481;00:52:55,548;Strong magic
507;00:52:55,650;00:52:58,784;to protect men from what lies beyond.
508;00:52:58,886;00:53:02,722;And while it stands,
508;00:52:58,886;00:53:02,722;the dead cannot pass.
509;00:53:02,824;00:53:03,824;I cannot pass.
510;00:53:20,541;00:53:22,475;Where will you go?
511;00:53:22,577;00:53:24,110;The great war is coming
512;00:53:24,212;00:53:27,012;and I still fight for the living.
513;00:53:29,083;00:53:31,183;I'll do what I can...
514;00:53:32,553;00:53:34,754;as long as I can.
515;00:53:38,659;00:53:40,760;Thank you, Uncle Benjen.
516;00:53:40,862;00:53:43,195;I wish you both good fortune.
517;00:54:22,470;00:54:25,004;Are you sure you're ready for this?
518;00:54:25,106;00:54:28,207;I'm the Three-Eyed
518;00:54:25,106;00:54:28,207;Raven now.
519;00:54:28,309;00:54:30,543;I have to be ready for this.
520;00:55:04,145;00:55:06,779;Ned?
521;00:55:06,881;00:55:09,381;Lyanna.
522;00:55:09,484;00:55:11,584;Is that you?
523;00:55:15,356;00:55:17,356;Is that really you?
524;00:55:22,296;00:55:24,196;You're not a dream?
525;00:55:25,333;00:55:27,433;No, I'm not a dream.
526;00:55:29,103;00:55:30,970;I'm here.
527;00:55:32,640;00:55:34,406;Right here.
528;00:55:34,509;00:55:36,842;I've missed you, big brother.
529;00:55:40,181;00:55:42,181;I've missed you, too.
530;00:55:46,521;00:55:48,420;I want to be brave.
531;00:55:48,523;00:55:50,956;Shh.
532;00:55:51,058;00:55:53,559;You are.
533;00:55:53,661;00:55:56,395;I'm not.
534;00:55:58,599;00:56:01,367;I don't want to die.
535;00:56:01,469;00:56:03,702;You're not going to die.
536;00:56:07,508;00:56:09,341;Get her some water.
537;00:56:09,443;00:56:11,744;No, no water.
537;00:56:09,443;00:56:11,744;Is there a maester?
538;00:56:11,846;00:56:14,179;Listen to me, Ned.
539;00:56:20,588;00:56:23,322;If Robert
539;00:56:20,588;00:56:23,322;finds out, he'll--
540;00:56:23,424;00:56:25,291;you know he will.
541;00:56:25,393;00:56:27,259;You have to protect him.
542;00:56:30,331;00:56:32,231;Promise me, Ned.
543;00:56:34,635;00:56:36,502;Promise me.
544;00:56:48,649;00:56:50,616;Promise me, Ned.
545;00:56:55,089;00:56:56,889;Promise me.
546;00:57:27,455;00:57:30,356;You can't expect Knights of the Vale
547;00:57:30,458;00:57:33,092;to side with wildling invaders.
548;00:57:33,194;00:57:37,129;We didn't invade.
548;00:57:33,194;00:57:37,129;We were invited.
549;00:57:37,231;00:57:38,931;Not by me.
550;00:57:39,033;00:57:40,833;The free folk, the northerners,
551;00:57:40,935;00:57:43,302;and the Knights of the Vale
551;00:57:40,935;00:57:43,302;fought bravely,
552;00:57:43,404;00:57:45,704;fought together, and we won.
553;00:57:45,806;00:57:50,542;My father used to say we find our
553;00:57:45,806;00:57:50,542;true friends on the battlefield.
554;00:57:50,645;00:57:53,245;The Boltons are defeated.
555;00:57:53,347;00:57:55,280;The war is over.
556;00:57:55,383;00:57:57,282;Winter has come.
557;00:57:57,385;00:58:00,886;If the maesters are right, it'll be
557;00:57:57,385;00:58:00,886;the coldest one in a thousand years.
558;00:58:00,988;00:58:04,423;We should ride home
558;00:58:00,988;00:58:04,423;and wait out the coming storms.
559;00:58:04,525;00:58:06,625;The war is not over.
560;00:58:06,727;00:58:08,761;And I promise you, friend,
561;00:58:08,863;00:58:11,797;the true enemy
561;00:58:08,863;00:58:11,797;won't wait out the storm.
562;00:58:11,899;00:58:13,399;He brings the storm.
563;00:58:33,387;00:58:37,456;Your son was butchered at the
563;00:58:33,387;00:58:37,456;Red Wedding, Lord Manderly,
564;00:58:37,558;00:58:39,391;but you refused the call.
565;00:58:42,730;00:58:45,731;You swore allegiance
565;00:58:42,730;00:58:45,731;to House Stark, Lord Glover,
566;00:58:45,833;00:58:48,434;but in their hour of greatest need,
567;00:58:48,536;00:58:50,536;you refused the call.
568;00:58:52,640;00:58:54,673;And you, Lord Cerwyn,
569;00:58:54,775;00:58:58,644;your father was skinned
569;00:58:54,775;00:58:58,644;alive by Ramsay Bolton.
570;00:58:58,746;00:59:01,213;Still you refused the call.
571;00:59:04,318;00:59:08,187;But House Mormont remembers.
572;00:59:08,289;00:59:10,989;The North remembers.
573;00:59:11,092;00:59:15,661;We know no king but the King in
573;00:59:11,092;00:59:15,661;the North whose name is Stark.
574;00:59:17,431;00:59:19,198;I don't care if he's a bastard.
575;00:59:19,300;00:59:21,900;Ned Stark's blood
575;00:59:19,300;00:59:21,900;runs through his veins.
576;00:59:22,002;00:59:26,472;He's my king from this
576;00:59:22,002;00:59:26,472;day until his last day.
577;00:59:43,157;00:59:45,724;Lady Mormont speaks harshly
578;00:59:45,826;00:59:47,126;and truly.
579;00:59:50,531;00:59:55,634;My son died for Robb Stark,
579;00:59:50,531;00:59:55,634;the Young Wolf.
580;00:59:55,736;00:59:58,804;I didn't think we'd find
580;00:59:55,736;00:59:58,804;another king in my lifetime.
581;00:59:58,906;01:00:01,340;I didn't commit my men to your cause
582;01:00:01,442;01:00:04,076;'cause I didn't want more
582;01:00:01,442;01:00:04,076;Manderlys dying for nothing.
583;01:00:06,347;01:00:07,813;But I was wrong.
584;01:00:13,521;01:00:15,754;Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding.
585;01:00:15,856;01:00:18,257;He is the White Wolf.
586;01:00:18,359;01:00:21,293;The King in the North.
587;01:00:28,769;01:00:31,236;I did not fight
587;01:00:28,769;01:00:31,236;beside you on the field
588;01:00:31,338;01:00:34,773;and I will regret that
588;01:00:31,338;01:00:34,773;until my dying day.
589;01:00:34,875;01:00:39,511;A man can only admit
589;01:00:34,875;01:00:39,511;when he was wrong
590;01:00:39,613;01:00:41,180;and ask forgiveness.
591;01:00:44,185;01:00:46,485;There's nothing to forgive, my lord.
592;01:00:49,089;01:00:51,590;There will be more fights to come.
593;01:00:51,692;01:00:55,227;House Glover will stand
593;01:00:51,692;01:00:55,227;behind House Stark
594;01:00:55,329;01:00:57,629;as we have for a thousand years.
595;01:00:59,466;01:01:01,700;And I will stand behind Jon Snow...
596;01:01:04,138;01:01:06,205;the King in the North!
597;01:01:08,108;01:01:11,009;The King in the North!
