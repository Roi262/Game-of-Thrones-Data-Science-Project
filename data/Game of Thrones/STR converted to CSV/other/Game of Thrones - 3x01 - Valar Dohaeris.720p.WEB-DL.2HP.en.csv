145;00:14:59,074;00:15:02,376;head, they lost their own.
146;00:15:02,410;00:15:04,478;Thanks to Father.
147;00:15:04,513;00:15:06,981;Thanks to Father.
148;00:15:08,483;00:15:10,585;Of course, it wasn't a rebel
148;00:15:08,483;00:15:10,585;who tried to kill me.
149;00:15:10,619;00:15:13,154;No? Curious.
150;00:15:13,188;00:15:16,991;Bit of a comedown
150;00:15:13,188;00:15:16,991;from chamber of the Hand.
151;00:15:17,025;00:15:19,227;But then I don't suppose
151;00:15:17,025;00:15:19,227;you need much room.
152;00:15:19,262;00:15:22,230;Grand Maester Pycelle
152;00:15:19,262;00:15:22,230;made the same joke.
153;00:15:22,264;00:15:25,567;You must be proud to be as funny as
153;00:15:22,264;00:15:25,567;a man whose balls brush his knees.
154;00:15:25,601;00:15:27,368;You're meeting Father today?
155;00:15:27,403;00:15:29,471;How do you know that?
156;00:15:29,505;00:15:32,341;Because I have hundreds
156;00:15:29,505;00:15:32,341;of spies in my employ.
157;00:15:32,375;00:15:35,877;The Master of Whisperers
157;00:15:32,375;00:15:35,877;owes me a favor or two.
158;00:15:37,480;00:15:40,515;Father told me.
158;00:15:37,480;00:15:40,515;What do you want from him?
159;00:15:40,550;00:15:42,183;What do I want from him?
159;00:15:40,550;00:15:42,183;He's my father.
160;00:15:42,217;00:15:44,719;Do I need to want something?
161;00:15:47,288;00:15:49,389;I'm sure he loves me dearly,
162;00:15:49,424;00:15:51,124;as any father loves his child,
163;00:15:51,159;00:15:53,827;his baby boy.
164;00:15:53,861;00:15:55,929;Yet he hasn't come
164;00:15:53,861;00:15:55,929;to visit once
165;00:15:55,996;00:15:57,597;since arriving
165;00:15:55,996;00:15:57,597;in King's Landing.
166;00:15:57,631;00:16:00,733;I lay here,
166;00:15:57,631;00:16:00,733;my face split in half,
167;00:16:00,801;00:16:03,303;but Father never came.
168;00:16:08,442;00:16:10,876;You're going to make me cry.
169;00:16:10,910;00:16:13,278;Why do you care
169;00:16:10,910;00:16:13,278;what I want from him?
170;00:16:14,747;00:16:16,782;Because you've slandered me
170;00:16:14,747;00:16:16,782;to Father before.
171;00:16:16,816;00:16:19,050;Slandered?
171;00:16:16,816;00:16:19,050;When?
172;00:16:19,084;00:16:21,319;You told him I had my guards
173;00:16:21,353;00:16:23,220;beat that servant girl
173;00:16:21,353;00:16:23,220;at Casterly Rock.
174;00:16:23,255;00:16:25,089;You did have
174;00:16:23,255;00:16:25,089;your guards beat her.
175;00:16:25,123;00:16:26,357;A girl of nine, I believe.
176;00:16:26,391;00:16:28,192;I was nine, too.
177;00:16:28,226;00:16:30,260;She lost an eye,
177;00:16:28,226;00:16:30,260;if I remember correctly.
178;00:16:30,295;00:16:31,695;If I remember correctly,
179;00:16:31,729;00:16:33,964;she never stole
179;00:16:31,729;00:16:33,964;a necklace again.
180;00:16:35,667;00:16:38,569;It's not slander if it's true.
181;00:16:38,603;00:16:41,305;And what's this truth
181;00:16:38,603;00:16:41,305;you plan on telling him today?
182;00:16:41,339;00:16:43,073;Why are you so nervous
183;00:16:43,107;00:16:45,342;about what I'm going
183;00:16:43,107;00:16:45,342;to say to Father?
184;00:16:45,376;00:16:47,444;Because you're a liar.
185;00:16:47,479;00:16:50,548;I expect you'll tell lies
185;00:16:47,479;00:16:50,548;about me, about Joffrey.
186;00:16:50,582;00:16:53,051;Any lies in particular?
187;00:16:54,787;00:16:57,222;You're a clever man,
188;00:16:57,257;00:16:59,525;but you're not half as clever
188;00:16:57,257;00:16:59,525;as you think you are.
189;00:16:59,559;00:17:02,595;Still makes me
189;00:16:59,559;00:17:02,595;more clever than you.
190;00:17:02,629;00:17:04,496;( door opens )
191;00:17:06,099;00:17:09,402;Oh, look at these two
191;00:17:06,099;00:17:09,402;shining warriors.
192;00:17:09,436;00:17:12,905;Ser Taryn Mant and...
193;00:17:12,939;00:17:14,674;Ser Whosit of Whocares.
194;00:17:14,708;00:17:16,075;Ser Meryn Trant.
195;00:17:16,110;00:17:18,645;Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
196;00:17:18,679;00:17:21,281;You're no knight.
196;00:17:18,679;00:17:21,281;Pod.
197;00:17:21,315;00:17:22,749;Ser Bronn of the Blackwater
198;00:17:22,783;00:17:24,684;was anointed
198;00:17:22,783;00:17:24,684;by the king himself.
199;00:17:24,752;00:17:27,420;You're an up-jumped
199;00:17:24,752;00:17:27,420;cutthroat,
200;00:17:27,455;00:17:29,056;nothing more.
201;00:17:29,090;00:17:31,025;That's exactly who I am.
202;00:17:31,059;00:17:32,826;And you're a grub
202;00:17:31,059;00:17:32,826;in fancy armor
203;00:17:32,861;00:17:36,130;who's better at beating little
203;00:17:32,861;00:17:36,130;girls than fighting men.
204;00:17:36,164;00:17:38,933;Now, I have an appointment
204;00:17:36,164;00:17:38,933;with Lord Tyrion.
205;00:17:38,968;00:17:41,803;You put your hand on that door,
206;00:17:41,838;00:17:44,439;you lose the hand.
207;00:18:00,256;00:18:02,957;As much as I appreciate a walk
207;00:18:00,256;00:18:02,957;in the sunshine, your lordship,
208;00:18:02,992;00:18:05,126;I am wondering
208;00:18:02,992;00:18:05,126;why you sent for me.
209;00:18:05,160;00:18:07,261;A number of people
209;00:18:05,160;00:18:07,261;in this city want to kill me.
210;00:18:07,295;00:18:08,595;You're here to protect me.
211;00:18:08,630;00:18:10,831;I've been doing that
211;00:18:08,630;00:18:10,831;for a while now.
212;00:18:10,865;00:18:12,633;Do you grow bored
212;00:18:10,865;00:18:12,633;protecting me?
213;00:18:12,667;00:18:14,134;I grow poor protecting you.
214;00:18:14,168;00:18:16,069;Poor?
214;00:18:14,168;00:18:16,069;Poor?
215;00:18:16,137;00:18:18,171;Under my patronage
215;00:18:16,137;00:18:18,171;you've become a knight,
216;00:18:18,206;00:18:20,273;you've served as Commander
216;00:18:18,206;00:18:20,273;of the City Watch.
217;00:18:20,308;00:18:23,043;Briefly.
217;00:18:20,308;00:18:23,043;I'm sure you filled your pockets.
218;00:18:23,077;00:18:25,145;And now my pockets are empty.
219;00:18:25,179;00:18:27,514;You've given me a taste
219;00:18:25,179;00:18:27,514;for the finer things.
220;00:18:27,549;00:18:29,550;And if you want me
220;00:18:27,549;00:18:29,550;to carry on protecting you,
221;00:18:29,584;00:18:30,918;you'll need to pay more.
222;00:18:30,952;00:18:33,420;I thought we were friends.
222;00:18:30,952;00:18:33,420;We are.
223;00:18:33,454;00:18:36,223;But I'm a sellsword.
223;00:18:33,454;00:18:36,223;I sell my sword.
224;00:18:36,257;00:18:38,024;I don't loan it out
224;00:18:36,257;00:18:38,024;to friends as a favor.
225;00:18:38,059;00:18:39,492;How much?
225;00:18:38,059;00:18:39,492;Double.
226;00:18:39,527;00:18:41,694;Double?
226;00:18:39,527;00:18:41,694;I'm a knight now.
227;00:18:41,729;00:18:43,162;Knights are worth double.
228;00:18:43,197;00:18:45,565;I don't even know how much
228;00:18:43,197;00:18:45,565;I'm paying you now.
229;00:18:45,599;00:18:47,667;Which means you can afford it.

232;00:19:25,704;00:19:28,239;Here. Here!
233;00:19:36,550;00:19:39,051;Help me!

235;00:20:01,710;00:20:03,010;Who are you?
236;00:20:05,547;00:20:09,751;I was in the battle
236;00:20:05,547;00:20:09,751;at Blackwater.
237;00:20:11,020;00:20:14,790;I was a captain and a knight.
238;00:20:14,824;00:20:18,694;Aye, ser,
238;00:20:14,824;00:20:18,694;and serving which king?
239;00:20:24,268;00:20:27,037;The one true king
239;00:20:24,268;00:20:27,037;of Westeros--
240;00:20:29,674;00:20:31,741;Stannis Baratheon.
241;00:20:41,284;00:20:42,918;I thought you were dead.
242;00:20:42,953;00:20:45,587;Everyone thought you were dead.
243;00:20:49,892;00:20:51,159;And your son?
244;00:20:56,932;00:20:59,334;He may have swam
244;00:20:56,932;00:20:59,334;ashore as you did.
245;00:20:59,368;00:21:02,404;No, the wildfire took him.
245;00:20:59,368;00:21:02,404;I saw it.
246;00:21:11,914;00:21:15,149;I'm so sorry, my friend.
247;00:21:15,184;00:21:17,719;I, too, have lost a son.
248;00:21:17,753;00:21:20,121;There is nothing worse
248;00:21:17,753;00:21:20,121;in this world.
249;00:21:21,790;00:21:25,025;But, Davos, you were
249;00:21:21,790;00:21:25,025;a good father.
250;00:21:25,059;00:21:28,595;If I was a good father,
250;00:21:25,059;00:21:28,595;he'd still be here.
251;00:21:31,565;00:21:33,199;Stannis lives?
252;00:21:33,233;00:21:35,435;He licks his wounds
252;00:21:33,233;00:21:35,435;at Dragonstone.
253;00:21:35,469;00:21:37,236;Will you take me there?
254;00:21:37,271;00:21:39,672;There is nothing for me
254;00:21:37,271;00:21:39,672;at Dragonstone.

257;00:21:42,576;00:21:45,311;the war is over.

259;00:21:47,380;00:21:49,849;I am sworn to no man.
260;00:21:49,883;00:21:53,686;I promised you 30 ships and you
260;00:21:49,883;00:21:53,686;promised me riches and glory.
261;00:21:53,720;00:21:55,221;I delivered the ships.
262;00:21:55,256;00:21:57,424;Stannis never gives up.
262;00:21:55,256;00:21:57,424;Never.
263;00:21:57,458;00:21:59,860;Now he will regroup--

266;00:22:04,066;00:22:06,301;not his generals,
266;00:22:04,066;00:22:06,301;not even his wife.

269;00:22:10,773;00:22:13,608;she sees in the flames
270;00:22:13,643;00:22:15,277;and burning men alive.
271;00:22:15,311;00:22:16,745;What?
272;00:22:16,780;00:22:20,282;They built a great fire
272;00:22:16,780;00:22:20,282;when Stannis returned.
273;00:22:20,316;00:22:23,218;All those who spoke
273;00:22:20,316;00:22:23,218;against her she called

275;00:22:27,823;00:22:30,358;They say she sang
275;00:22:27,823;00:22:30,358;to them as they burned.
276;00:22:35,164;00:22:36,665;I'm a pirate.
277;00:22:36,699;00:22:39,000;You're a smuggler.

279;00:22:40,736;00:22:44,005;good place for us to avoid.
280;00:22:44,039;00:22:46,306;Take me back there, please.
281;00:22:46,341;00:22:48,241;You cannot turn
281;00:22:46,341;00:22:48,241;Stannis against her.
282;00:22:48,276;00:22:50,910;Maybe not, but I could
282;00:22:48,276;00:22:50,910;carve her heart out.
283;00:22:50,945;00:22:52,545;You could try.

284;00:22:52,580;00:22:54,948;they will burn you.

285;00:22:54,982;00:22:57,851;they'll burn you.
286;00:22:57,885;00:23:00,020;And you've only
286;00:22:57,885;00:23:00,020;just come back to life.
287;00:23:00,054;00:23:02,289;Stay alive a little

288;00:23:02,323;00:23:05,058;You call me friend. You drank
288;00:23:02,323;00:23:05,058;with me on my wedding day.
289;00:23:05,092;00:23:07,560;And you drank with me
289;00:23:05,092;00:23:07,560;on four of my wedding days,
290;00:23:07,595;00:23:09,496;but I don't ask you for favors.
291;00:23:09,530;00:23:11,131;I have to stop her.
292;00:23:11,165;00:23:14,301;Please, do this for me.
293;00:23:17,139;00:23:19,507;When you are dead,
294;00:23:19,541;00:23:21,976;I will gather your bones

295;00:23:22,010;00:23:25,113;and let your widow
295;00:23:22,010;00:23:25,113;wear them around her neck.
296;00:23:38,061;00:23:41,329;We should set the siege lines

297;00:23:41,363;00:23:44,132;Mountain can't defend a ruin.
298;00:23:44,166;00:23:45,667;I imagine the Mountain
298;00:23:44,166;00:23:45,667;will defend

301;00:23:49,805;00:23:52,507;The men would love a fight.
302;00:23:52,542;00:23:55,344;I don't think
302;00:23:52,542;00:23:55,344;we're going to get one.

305;00:24:47,733;00:24:50,736;The debt will be
305;00:24:47,733;00:24:50,736;repaid, my friend.

333;00:27:21,459;00:27:23,861;I was very happy

335;00:27:25,963;00:27:27,931;I heard how happy you were.

338;00:27:32,469;00:27:35,071;It wasn't your bed at the time.
339;00:27:37,508;00:27:40,443;I sent you here
339;00:27:37,508;00:27:40,443;to advise the king.
340;00:27:40,477;00:27:44,513;I gave you real power

341;00:27:44,547;00:27:46,882;You chose to spend your days
342;00:27:46,916;00:27:49,084;as you always have,
343;00:27:49,118;00:27:51,553;bedding harlots
344;00:27:51,587;00:27:53,955;and drinking with thieves.
345;00:27:55,683;00:27:58,485;Occasionally I drank
345;00:27:55,683;00:27:58,485;with the harlots.
346;00:27:58,880;00:28:00,682;What do you want, Tyrion?
347;00:28:00,730;00:28:03,732;Why does everyone assume
347;00:28:00,730;00:28:03,732;I want something?
348;00:28:03,766;00:28:06,668;Can't I simply visit

351;00:28:13,981;00:28:15,334;after he fell
351;00:28:13,981;00:28:15,334;on the battlefield.
352;00:28:15,369;00:28:18,938;Maester Pycelle assured me

354;00:28:22,008;00:28:25,177;while you held court
354;00:28:22,008;00:28:25,177;in the ruins of Harrenhal.
355;00:28:25,211;00:28:27,945;I led the foray when the

356;00:28:27,980;00:28:30,248;while your grandson, the king,
357;00:28:30,282;00:28:32,917;quivered in fear
357;00:28:30,282;00:28:32,917;behind the walls.
358;00:28:32,951;00:28:36,554;I bled in the mud
358;00:28:32,951;00:28:36,554;for our family.
359;00:28:37,523;00:28:39,057;And as my reward,
360;00:28:39,091;00:28:42,427;I was trundled off
360;00:28:39,091;00:28:42,427;to some dark little cell.
361;00:28:42,461;00:28:44,462;But what do I want?
362;00:28:45,798;00:28:47,932;A little bloody gratitude
362;00:28:45,798;00:28:47,932;would be a start.

365;00:28:53,706;00:28:56,741;Do you think I demanded
365;00:28:53,706;00:28:56,741;a garland of roses
366;00:28:56,776;00:28:59,478;every time I suffered
366;00:28:56,776;00:28:59,478;a wound on a battlefield?
367;00:28:59,512;00:29:01,479;Hmm?
368;00:29:01,547;00:29:05,316;Now, I have seven kingdoms
368;00:29:01,547;00:29:05,316;to look after
369;00:29:05,384;00:29:07,718;and three of them
369;00:29:05,384;00:29:07,718;are in open rebellion.
370;00:29:07,753;00:29:12,523;So tell me what you want.
371;00:29:16,429;00:29:19,231;I want what is mine by right.
372;00:29:20,934;00:29:24,270;Jaime is your eldest son,

386;00:30:03,546;00:30:06,081;so that you can

387;00:30:06,115;00:30:08,216;and protect our legacy.

389;00:30:09,919;00:30:12,454;you will be rewarded
389;00:30:09,919;00:30:12,454;with a suitable wife.
390;00:30:12,488;00:30:16,324;And I would let myself

392;00:30:17,660;00:30:20,596;and making you

393;00:30:22,198;00:30:24,999;Why?
393;00:30:22,198;00:30:24,999;Why?
394;00:30:25,033;00:30:27,168;You ask that?
395;00:30:27,202;00:30:30,604;You, who killed your mother

411;00:31:43,911;00:31:46,714;It's going to Dorne.
412;00:31:46,748;00:31:49,650;Shae: Why Dorne?
412;00:31:46,748;00:31:49,650;It's carrying silk
413;00:31:49,685;00:31:53,154;and it's supposed to bring
413;00:31:49,685;00:31:53,154;back wine in exchange.
414;00:31:57,192;00:31:59,526;But it's not coming back.
415;00:31:59,561;00:32:02,162;The captain's tired
415;00:31:59,561;00:32:02,162;of risking his life
416;00:32:02,197;00:32:04,365;so King's Landing
416;00:32:02,197;00:32:04,365;lords and ladies
417;00:32:04,399;00:32:07,468;can get drunk on better
417;00:32:04,399;00:32:07,468;wine than they deserve.
418;00:32:08,837;00:32:11,039;He's going to stay in Dorne.
419;00:32:11,073;00:32:14,409;Wait out the winter where
419;00:32:11,073;00:32:14,409;it's beautiful and warm.
420;00:32:14,443;00:32:18,213;I met some people in Dorne who
420;00:32:14,443;00:32:18,213;weren't so beautiful and warm.
421;00:32:18,248;00:32:20,216;Don't ruin the game.
422;00:32:20,250;00:32:22,986;I told you,
422;00:32:20,250;00:32:22,986;I don't want to play.
423;00:32:24,088;00:32:26,122;What about that one there?
424;00:32:26,157;00:32:27,624;That one?
425;00:32:27,658;00:32:29,660;It's going to Volantis.
426;00:32:29,694;00:32:31,128;Why?
427;00:32:31,162;00:32:32,863;Because when I got
427;00:32:31,162;00:32:32,863;on a ship in Volantis,
428;00:32:32,897;00:32:35,432;it looked like that one.
429;00:32:35,467;00:32:37,268;That's not how the game works.
430;00:32:37,302;00:32:40,872;You're not supposed to just
430;00:32:37,302;00:32:40,872;blurt out the right answer.
431;00:32:40,906;00:32:42,506;You've got to invent a story
432;00:32:42,541;00:32:45,976;about where the ship
432;00:32:42,541;00:32:45,976;is going and why.
433;00:32:46,011;00:32:48,880;Why should I make up a story
433;00:32:46,011;00:32:48,880;when I know the truth?
434;00:32:48,914;00:32:50,948;Because the truth
435;00:32:50,983;00:32:53,518;is always either
435;00:32:50,983;00:32:53,518;terrible or boring.
436;00:32:53,552;00:32:56,321;Lovely day for it.
437;00:32:56,355;00:32:58,257;Watching the ships.

439;00:33:01,295;00:33:04,330;Might I speak with Lady Sansa
440;00:33:04,365;00:33:05,999;alone for a moment?
441;00:33:17,478;00:33:20,346;I saw your mother not long ago.
442;00:33:21,748;00:33:24,049;She's very eager to see you.
443;00:33:25,819;00:33:29,120;And your sister.
444;00:33:29,155;00:33:31,757;Arya's alive?
445;00:33:35,061;00:33:36,928;You said you'd take me home.
446;00:33:36,962;00:33:40,331;You said King's Landing
446;00:33:36,962;00:33:40,331;was your home.
447;00:33:41,533;00:33:42,900;You are the property
447;00:33:41,533;00:33:42,900;of the crown.
448;00:33:42,934;00:33:44,301;Stealing you would be treason.
449;00:33:44,336;00:33:46,570;If you were to tell
449;00:33:44,336;00:33:46,570;just one person--
450;00:33:46,605;00:33:48,606;I won't tell anyone.
450;00:33:46,605;00:33:48,606;How do I know?
451;00:33:48,640;00:33:50,574;Because I'm a terrible liar.
452;00:33:50,608;00:33:53,243;You said so yourself.
453;00:33:53,277;00:33:56,446;Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do.
453;00:33:53,277;00:33:56,446;Tell me when.
454;00:33:59,683;00:34:01,217;I'm waiting for word
454;00:33:59,683;00:34:01,217;on an assignment
455;00:34:01,251;00:34:04,453;that will take me far away
455;00:34:01,251;00:34:04,453;from the capital.
456;00:34:04,521;00:34:06,188;When I set sail,
457;00:34:06,222;00:34:08,757;I might be able
457;00:34:06,222;00:34:08,757;to take you with me.
458;00:34:08,791;00:34:11,793;But you'll need to be ready to
458;00:34:08,791;00:34:11,793;leave on a moment's notice.
459;00:34:14,230;00:34:16,498;You're her handmaiden?
460;00:34:18,534;00:34:21,370;Yes.
460;00:34:18,534;00:34:21,370;And you're his...?
461;00:34:21,404;00:34:24,874;I help manage his affairs.
462;00:34:24,908;00:34:28,311;He's an important person.
462;00:34:24,908;00:34:28,311;So is she.
463;00:34:28,345;00:34:30,879;I grew up in the shadow
463;00:34:28,345;00:34:30,879;of her father's castle.

466;00:34:37,721;00:34:40,356;We've both done
466;00:34:37,721;00:34:40,356;rather well, you and I.
467;00:34:42,927;00:34:44,694;Yes.
468;00:34:44,728;00:34:47,964;Given where we started.
469;00:34:47,998;00:34:50,233;And where is that?
470;00:34:51,702;00:34:53,769;It's not easy for girls like us
471;00:34:53,804;00:34:55,972;to dig our way out.
472;00:35:00,744;00:35:03,345;Ros:

481;00:36:09,247;00:36:11,516;I can't wait that long.
482;00:36:14,753;00:36:16,388;I need an army.

484;00:36:17,757;00:36:20,191;We'll be in Astapor

560;00:41:38,271;00:41:40,504;He was a soldier.

609;00:44:19,796;00:44:24,166;Yes. I paid a visit
