1;00:00:05,778;00:00:08,027;We have suffered at each other's hands.
2;00:00:08,694;00:00:11,402;We have lost people
2;00:00:08,694;00:00:11,402;we love at each other's hands.
3;00:00:14,277;00:00:16,069;This isn't about noble houses,
4;00:00:16,444;00:00:18,736;this is about the living and the dead.
5;00:00:18,819;00:00:20,444;And I intend to stay
5;00:00:18,819;00:00:20,444;amongst the living.
6;00:00:22,194;00:00:23,819;I offer you a choice.
7;00:00:24,027;00:00:25,527;Bend the knee and join me,
8;00:00:25,819;00:00:27,736;or refuse, and die.
9;00:00:32,027;00:00:34,277;She is here to reclaim
9;00:00:32,027;00:00:34,277;the Seven Kingdoms.
10;00:00:34,486;00:00:36,444;The North is one of
10;00:00:34,486;00:00:36,444;those seven kingdoms.
11;00:00:38,527;00:00:41,277;The Night King's army
11;00:00:38,527;00:00:41,277;grows larger by the day.
12;00:00:45,235;00:00:47,486;We need allies. Powerful allies.
13;00:00:53,611;00:00:54,985;The monsters are real.
14;00:00:56,277;00:00:59,110;Dragons, White Walkers,
14;00:00:56,277;00:00:59,110;Dothraki screamers...
15;00:01:00,361;00:01:01,681;Let the monsters kill each other.
16;00:01:02,027;00:01:03,861;We will deal with whatever is left.
17;00:01:07,277;00:01:09,069;We are going to destroy the Night King
18;00:01:09,152;00:01:11,110;and his army, and we'll do it together.
19;00:01:12,653;00:01:15,319;He pledged to fight
19;00:01:12,653;00:01:15,319;for Daenerys Targaryen.
20;00:01:15,611;00:01:16,611;He's bent the knee.
21;00:01:17,069;00:01:18,778;He needs to know the truth.
22;00:01:21,486;00:01:23,194;Jon isn't really my father's son.
23;00:01:23,778;00:01:25,653;He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen,
24;00:01:25,861;00:01:27,486;and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.
25;00:01:28,653;00:01:30,361;He's the heir to the Iron Throne.
26;00:01:30,944;00:01:32,319;We need to tell him.
27;00:01:37,444;00:01:39,944;The same thing
27;00:01:37,444;00:01:39,944;is coming for all of us...
28;00:01:42,985;00:01:44,027;And it is here.

30;00:06:25,985;00:06:27,903;You should consider yourself lucky.
31;00:06:29,444;00:06:31,277;At least your balls won't freeze off.
32;00:06:31,361;00:06:33,486;You take great offense at dwarf jokes,
33;00:06:33,569;00:06:36,110;but love telling eunuch jokes.
33;00:06:33,569;00:06:36,110;Why is that?
34;00:06:37,361;00:06:40,277;Because I have balls, and you don't.
35;00:07:07,819;00:07:09,319;I warned you.
36;00:07:09,402;00:07:12,152;Northerners don't much trust outsiders.
37;00:08:33,778;00:08:35,319;Look at you.
38;00:08:36,486;00:08:37,736;You're a man.
39;00:08:38,736;00:08:39,778;Almost.
40;00:08:59,444;00:09:02,319;Where's Arya?
40;00:08:59,444;00:09:02,319;Lurking somewhere.
41;00:09:08,944;00:09:11,402;Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
42;00:09:12,694;00:09:16,527;My sister, Sansa Stark,
42;00:09:12,694;00:09:16,527;the Lady of Winterfell.
43;00:09:16,611;00:09:19,569;Thank you for inviting us
43;00:09:16,611;00:09:19,569;into your home, Lady Stark.
44;00:09:19,653;00:09:21,027;The North is as beautiful
45;00:09:21,110;00:09:24,444;as your brother claimed, as are you.
46;00:09:27,944;00:09:30,319;Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.
47;00:09:31,778;00:09:33,611;We don't have time for all this.
48;00:09:33,694;00:09:37,486;The Night King has your dragon.
48;00:09:33,694;00:09:37,486;He's one of them now.
49;00:09:38,486;00:09:39,944;The Wall has fallen,
50;00:09:40,027;00:09:42,194;the dead march south.
51;00:09:47,486;00:09:49,402;As soon as we heard about the Wall,
52;00:09:49,486;00:09:52,611;I called all our banners
52;00:09:49,486;00:09:52,611;to retreat to Winterfell.
53;00:09:53,861;00:09:54,861;Lord Umber...
54;00:09:56,194;00:09:59,152;when can we expect
54;00:09:56,194;00:09:59,152;your people to arrive?
55;00:10:03,361;00:10:07,319;We need more horses and wagons,
55;00:10:03,361;00:10:07,319;if it please my lady.
56;00:10:09,653;00:10:11,277;And my lord.
57;00:10:13,611;00:10:17,110;And my queen.
57;00:10:13,611;00:10:17,110;Sorry.
58;00:10:17,194;00:10:19,152;You'll have as many as we can spare.
59;00:10:19,235;00:10:22,444;Hurry back to Last Hearth
59;00:10:19,235;00:10:22,444;and bring your people here.
60;00:10:25,361;00:10:28,152;We need to send ravens
60;00:10:25,361;00:10:28,152;to the Night's Watch as well.
61;00:10:28,235;00:10:30,694;There's no sense in
61;00:10:28,235;00:10:30,694;manning the castles anymore.
62;00:10:30,778;00:10:31,861;We make our stand here.
63;00:10:31,944;00:10:33,027;At once, Your Grace.
64;00:10:34,027;00:10:35,569;Your Grace.
65;00:10:41,194;00:10:43,069;But you're not. Are you?
66;00:10:44,027;00:10:45,527;You left Winterfell a king
67;00:10:45,611;00:10:47,027;and came back a...
68;00:10:49,527;00:10:51,486;I'm not sure what you are now.
69;00:10:51,569;00:10:54,110;A lord?
70;00:10:54,194;00:10:56,486;Nothing at all?
71;00:10:56,569;00:10:58,778;It's not important.
71;00:10:56,569;00:10:58,778;Not important?
72;00:10:59,944;00:11:02,152;We named you King in the North.
73;00:11:03,736;00:11:05,235;King of the North!
74;00:11:10,361;00:11:12,110;You did, my lady.
75;00:11:13,653;00:11:15,486;It was the honor of my life.
76;00:11:15,569;00:11:18,277;I'll always be grateful for your faith.
77;00:11:20,402;00:11:21,653;But when I left Winterfell,
78;00:11:21,736;00:11:24,402;I told you
78;00:11:21,736;00:11:24,402;we need allies or we will die.
79;00:11:25,569;00:11:27,277;I have brought those allies home
80;00:11:27,361;00:11:29,444;to fight alongside us.
81;00:11:30,736;00:11:32,402;I had a choice,
82;00:11:32,486;00:11:36,527;keep my crown or protect the North.
83;00:11:36,611;00:11:38,486;I chose the North.
84;00:11:50,861;00:11:53,194;If anyone survives the war to come,
85;00:11:53,277;00:11:54,944;we'll have Jon Snow to thank.
86;00:11:56,402;00:11:58,861;He risked his life
86;00:11:56,402;00:11:58,861;to show us the threat is real.
87;00:11:58,944;00:12:00,736;Thanks to his courage,
88;00:12:00,819;00:12:02,861;we have brought with us
88;00:12:00,819;00:12:02,861;the greatest army
89;00:12:02,944;00:12:04,027;the world has ever seen.
90;00:12:04,110;00:12:07,319;We have brought
90;00:12:04,110;00:12:07,319;two full-grown dragons.
91;00:12:09,486;00:12:10,861;And soon, the Lannister army
92;00:12:10,944;00:12:13,027;will ride north to join our cause.
93;00:12:17,653;00:12:19,152;I know, I know, our people
94;00:12:19,235;00:12:21,819;haven't been friends in the past.
95;00:12:24,152;00:12:25,861;But we must fight together now...
96;00:12:26,985;00:12:27,985;or die.
97;00:12:30,027;00:12:32,486;May I ask, how are we meant to feed
98;00:12:32,569;00:12:34,527;the greatest army
98;00:12:32,569;00:12:34,527;the world has ever seen?
99;00:12:34,611;00:12:37,235;While I ensured our stores
99;00:12:34,611;00:12:37,235;would last through winter,
100;00:12:37,319;00:12:39,069;I didn't account for Dothraki,
101;00:12:39,152;00:12:42,861;Unsullied
101;00:12:39,152;00:12:42,861;and two full-grown dragons.
102;00:12:44,486;00:12:46,486;What do dragons eat, anyway?
103;00:12:48,653;00:12:49,985;Whatever they want.
104;00:13:08,444;00:13:12,277;Hey, careful, lads.
104;00:13:08,444;00:13:12,277;We need every last bit of it.
105;00:13:12,361;00:13:13,653;Sorry 'bout that.
106;00:13:17,861;00:13:19,486;Are these the last of the wagons?
107;00:13:19,569;00:13:20,985;Aye.
108;00:13:21,069;00:13:23,694;All right, let's get it
108;00:13:21,069;00:13:23,694;all to the forges.
109;00:13:31,694;00:13:32,694;My lord.
110;00:13:34,861;00:13:35,861;My lady.
111;00:13:42,486;00:13:43,527;My lady.
112;00:13:55,527;00:13:56,944;The Lady of Winterfell.
113;00:13:58,778;00:14:00,736;Has a nice ring to it.
114;00:14:00,819;00:14:02,694;So does Hand of the Queen.
115;00:14:03,985;00:14:06,027;Depending on the queen, I suppose.
116;00:14:08,736;00:14:11,444;Last time we spoke
116;00:14:08,736;00:14:11,444;was at Joffrey's wedding.
117;00:14:12,736;00:14:15,527;Miserable affair.
117;00:14:12,736;00:14:15,527;It had its moments.
118;00:14:21,235;00:14:23,527;Apologies for leaving like that.
119;00:14:23,611;00:14:25,152;Yes, it was a bit hard to explain
120;00:14:25,235;00:14:27,985;why my wife fled
120;00:14:25,235;00:14:27,985;moments after the king's murder.
121;00:14:30,569;00:14:31,778;We both survived.
122;00:14:34,736;00:14:36,444;Many underestimated you.
123;00:14:37,694;00:14:39,277;Most of them are dead now.
124;00:14:47,235;00:14:48,944;I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear
125;00:14:49,027;00:14:50,903;the Lannister army's marching north.
126;00:14:53,069;00:14:56,194;You have every right
126;00:14:53,069;00:14:56,194;to be fearful of my sister.
127;00:14:56,277;00:14:57,736;No one fears her more than I do.
128;00:14:57,819;00:15:00,736;But I promise, you'll be safe...
128;00:14:57,819;00:15:00,736;Cersei told you her army
129;00:15:00,819;00:15:03,569;was coming north to fight for you?
130;00:15:03,653;00:15:04,653;She did.
131;00:15:06,277;00:15:07,694;And you believed her?
132;00:15:09,110;00:15:10,819;She has something to live for now.
133;00:15:10,903;00:15:13,694;I believe she wants to survive.
134;00:15:16,152;00:15:18,653;I used to think you were
134;00:15:16,152;00:15:18,653;the cleverest man alive.
135;00:15:50,653;00:15:52,319;You used to be taller.
136;00:15:55,110;00:15:56,653;How did you sneak up on me?
137;00:15:56,736;00:15:59,569;How did you survive
137;00:15:56,736;00:15:59,569;a knife through the heart?
138;00:15:59,653;00:16:01,152;I didn't.
139;00:16:19,486;00:16:20,736;You still have it.
140;00:16:23,944;00:16:25,152;Needle.
141;00:16:27,194;00:16:29,069;Have you ever used it?
142;00:16:29,985;00:16:31,736;Once or twice.
143;00:16:47,069;00:16:48,903;Valyrian steel.
144;00:16:50,486;00:16:51,486;Jealous?
145;00:16:51,527;00:16:54,694;Too heavy for me.
146;00:17:02,861;00:17:04,736;Where were you before?
147;00:17:04,819;00:17:07,527;I could've used your help with Sansa.
148;00:17:09,569;00:17:11,778;She doesn't like your queen, does she?
149;00:17:11,861;00:17:14,611;Sansa thinks
149;00:17:11,861;00:17:14,611;she's smarter than everyone.
150;00:17:15,944;00:17:17,985;She's the smartest person
150;00:17:15,944;00:17:17,985;I've ever met.
151;00:17:19,361;00:17:20,653;Now you're defending her?
152;00:17:20,736;00:17:22,110;You?
153;00:17:23,444;00:17:25,235;I'm defending our family.
154;00:17:26,611;00:17:27,778;So is she.
155;00:17:27,861;00:17:29,277;Yeah.
156;00:17:30,736;00:17:32,319;I'm her family too.
157;00:17:38,361;00:17:39,611;Don't forget that.
158;00:17:57,444;00:18:00,819;Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring
158;00:17:57,444;00:18:00,819;terrible news.
159;00:18:01,985;00:18:03,985;The dead have broken through the Wall.
160;00:18:07,611;00:18:08,861;Good.
161;00:18:43,069;00:18:45,444;Why don't you just
161;00:18:43,069;00:18:45,444;get it over with and kill me?
162;00:18:45,527;00:18:48,486;But we're family.
163;00:18:49,694;00:18:52,444;The last Greyjoys left in the world.
164;00:18:55,361;00:18:57,611;The last ones with balls anyway.
165;00:19:02,569;00:19:03,903;If I kill you...
166;00:19:05,361;00:19:06,861;who can I talk to?
167;00:19:07,778;00:19:09,152;Hmm?
168;00:19:11,694;00:19:14,027;I've got a crew full of mutes.
169;00:19:17,361;00:19:19,069;It gets lonely at sea.
170;00:19:21,819;00:19:23,736;Are we in King's Landing?
171;00:19:23,819;00:19:24,903;Mm.
172;00:19:29,444;00:19:31,569;You picked the losing side.
173;00:19:35,235;00:19:37,903;Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet
173;00:19:35,235;00:19:37,903;somewhere else.
174;00:19:44,985;00:19:47,903;But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.
175;00:20:01,444;00:20:03,194;Twenty-thousand men, is it?
176;00:20:03,277;00:20:06,319;Yes, Your Grace.
176;00:20:03,277;00:20:06,319;A few died in transit.
177;00:20:08,611;00:20:10,110;They cheated at dice.
178;00:20:12,069;00:20:14,027;Or maybe I cheated.
179;00:20:14,110;00:20:15,235;Someone cheated.
180;00:20:17,319;00:20:19,861;They weren't good fighters.
180;00:20:17,319;00:20:19,861;You won't miss them.
181;00:20:19,944;00:20:21,861;Horses?
181;00:20:19,944;00:20:21,861;Two thousand.
182;00:20:21,944;00:20:23,194;And elephants?
183;00:20:23,277;00:20:25,653;Uh, no elephants, Your Grace.
184;00:20:27,277;00:20:28,444;That's disappointing.
185;00:20:29,819;00:20:31,985;I was told the Golden Company
185;00:20:29,819;00:20:31,985;had elephants.
186;00:20:32,069;00:20:34,444;They are excellent beasts, Your Grace,
187;00:20:34,527;00:20:38,027;but not well-suited
187;00:20:34,527;00:20:38,027;to long sea voyages.
188;00:20:38,110;00:20:39,653;In any event, you are most welcome
189;00:20:39,736;00:20:41,903;here in King's Landing,
189;00:20:39,736;00:20:41,903;Captain Strickland.
190;00:20:41,985;00:20:45,194;We look forward to fighting
190;00:20:41,985;00:20:45,194;on your behalf, Your Grace.
191;00:20:56,152;00:20:57,819;Am I most welcome here?
192;00:20:59,319;00:21:01,944;You are a true friend of the crown
193;00:21:02,027;00:21:03,903;and an honored guest.
194;00:21:03,985;00:21:05,235;Good.
195;00:21:05,319;00:21:08,361;As a true friend
195;00:21:05,319;00:21:08,361;and an honored guest...
196;00:21:17,194;00:21:20,361;I was hoping we could talk in private.
197;00:21:21,569;00:21:23,778;After the war.
197;00:21:21,569;00:21:23,778;That was our agreement.
198;00:21:23,861;00:21:27,694;Wars sometimes last years.
199;00:21:28,861;00:21:31,361;You want a whore, buy one.
200;00:21:33,152;00:21:34,527;You want a queen...
201;00:21:35,819;00:21:37,527;earn her.
202;00:21:40,402;00:21:41,402;How?
203;00:21:42,486;00:21:43,819;I've given her justice,
204;00:21:43,903;00:21:46,611;an army and the Iron Fleet,
205;00:21:46,694;00:21:49,736;yet she gives me no sign of affection.
206;00:21:50,694;00:21:52,861;My heart is nearly broken.
207;00:21:55,152;00:21:56,402;You're insolent.
208;00:21:58,110;00:22:02,527;I've executed men for less.
208;00:21:58,110;00:22:02,527;They were lesser men.
209;00:22:41,319;00:22:44,235;I hear the dragon burnt up
209;00:22:41,319;00:22:44,235;a thousand Lannister men.
210;00:22:44,319;00:22:46,235;Burnt up some of my favorite boys.
211;00:22:46,319;00:22:47,985;Archie, was it?
211;00:22:46,319;00:22:47,985;And William.
212;00:22:48,069;00:22:51,069;Tall handsome William?
212;00:22:48,069;00:22:51,069;Yeah, tall handsome William.
213;00:22:51,152;00:22:53,819;They said what's left of him
213;00:22:51,152;00:22:53,819;could fit in a wine glass.
214;00:22:53,903;00:22:57,361;I am the only man you ever met
214;00:22:53,903;00:22:57,361;who shot a dragon.
215;00:22:57,444;00:22:59,194;Did you?
215;00:22:57,444;00:22:59,194;Nearly killed it.
216;00:22:59,277;00:23:00,277;That's brave.
217;00:23:10,569;00:23:13,110;That boy Eddie...
217;00:23:10,569;00:23:13,110;The ginger?
218;00:23:13,194;00:23:16,361;That's him. Came back
218;00:23:13,194;00:23:16,361;with his face burnt right off.
219;00:23:16,444;00:23:17,694;He's got no eyelids now.
220;00:23:17,778;00:23:19,402;How does he sleep with no eyelids?
221;00:23:19,486;00:23:21,985;All right, can we stop talking
221;00:23:19,486;00:23:21,985;about the fucking dragons now?
222;00:23:22,069;00:23:23,944;Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
223;00:23:26,152;00:23:27,235;You're kidding me.
224;00:23:27,319;00:23:28,736;Apologies for the interruption,
225;00:23:28,819;00:23:31,152;but the queen did urge me to hurry.
226;00:23:33,569;00:23:34,778;Sorry, ladies.
227;00:23:36,819;00:23:38,361;Another time perhaps.
228;00:23:46,069;00:23:49,819;You ever get lonely,
228;00:23:46,069;00:23:49,819;I am partial to older gentlemen.
229;00:23:52,861;00:23:56,110;Poor girl. The pox will take her
229;00:23:52,861;00:23:56,110;within the year.
230;00:23:57,736;00:23:59,736;Which girl?
230;00:23:57,736;00:23:59,736;The queen's brothers
231;00:23:59,819;00:24:02,444;made promises to you and broke them.
232;00:24:02,527;00:24:04,819;Her Grace wants to rectify
232;00:24:02,527;00:24:04,819;their mistake.
233;00:24:06,527;00:24:08,944;She once gave me a castle and a wife,
234;00:24:09,027;00:24:10,694;then rectified me right out of them.
235;00:24:10,778;00:24:13,069;That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers.
236;00:24:13,152;00:24:15,027;When Queen Cersei wants something,
237;00:24:15,110;00:24:16,903;she pays in advance and in gold.
238;00:24:16,985;00:24:18,736;Several chests of it, in fact.
239;00:24:18,819;00:24:22,027;Waiting for you
239;00:24:18,819;00:24:22,027;in a wagon just outside.
240;00:24:26,611;00:24:31,444;So she wants to murder someone,
240;00:24:26,611;00:24:31,444;but she can't send her soldiers.
241;00:24:31,527;00:24:33,611;If it's the Dragon Queen she's after...
242;00:24:33,694;00:24:35,778;She has other plans
242;00:24:33,694;00:24:35,778;for the Targaryen girl.
243;00:24:35,861;00:24:37,944;Yeah, well, good luck with that.
244;00:24:38,027;00:24:39,861;Our queen's brothers are unlikely
245;00:24:39,944;00:24:42,277;to survive their Northern adventures.
246;00:24:42,361;00:24:44,694;But in the event that they do...
247;00:24:51,235;00:24:54,903;She has a keen sense of poetic justice.
248;00:24:56,152;00:24:57,985;That fucking family.
249;00:24:58,069;00:24:59,819;When the Citadel expelled me,
250;00:24:59,903;00:25:01,736;I thought I would die poor and alone,
251;00:25:01,819;00:25:05,819;but in exchange for my service,
251;00:25:01,819;00:25:05,819;Queen Cersei made me her Hand.
252;00:25:05,903;00:25:07,778;What would she do for the man
253;00:25:07,861;00:25:10,235;who rids her
253;00:25:07,861;00:25:10,235;of her treasonous brothers?
254;00:25:26,361;00:25:28,736;I wanted those elephants.
255;00:25:34,819;00:25:35,819;So...
256;00:25:37,611;00:25:41,611;how do I compare to the fat king?
257;00:25:42,611;00:25:44,444;You're insulting my late husband?
258;00:25:44,527;00:25:45,778;Are you offended?
259;00:25:50,361;00:25:53,027;Robert had a different whore
259;00:25:50,361;00:25:53,027;every night,
260;00:25:53,110;00:25:56,110;but he still didn't know
260;00:25:53,110;00:25:56,110;his way around a woman's body.
261;00:25:57,069;00:25:58,152;And the Kingslayer?
262;00:26:03,736;00:26:05,778;You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?
263;00:26:07,444;00:26:08,611;Life is boring.
264;00:26:08,694;00:26:11,819;You're not boring, I'll give you that.
265;00:26:23,819;00:26:25,778;Do I please the queen?
266;00:26:27,235;00:26:30,611;You might be the most
266;00:26:27,235;00:26:30,611;arrogant man I've ever met.
267;00:26:32,778;00:26:34,152;I like that.
268;00:26:36,027;00:26:38,486;But now I want to be alone.
269;00:26:44,944;00:26:47,778;I'm going to put a prince in your belly.
270;00:28:22,069;00:28:24,694;Euron can't defend the Iron Islands,
271;00:28:24,778;00:28:28,277;not if he's in King's Landing
271;00:28:24,778;00:28:28,277;with all his men and his ships.
272;00:28:29,402;00:28:31,027;We can take our home back.
273;00:28:31,110;00:28:32,611;Daenerys went north.
274;00:28:32,694;00:28:34,611;Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat
275;00:28:34,694;00:28:36,235;if they can't hold the North.
276;00:28:36,319;00:28:39,069;Somewhere the dead can't go.
277;00:28:44,361;00:28:47,611;You're my queen.
277;00:28:44,361;00:28:47,611;I go where you command.
278;00:28:52,527;00:28:54,527;You want to go to Winterfell.
279;00:28:54,611;00:28:56,110;To fight for the Starks.
280;00:28:59,985;00:29:00,985;Go.
281;00:29:05,778;00:29:07,861;What is dead may never die.
282;00:29:11,361;00:29:13,319;What is dead may never die.
283;00:29:18,027;00:29:20,277;But kill the bastards anyway.
284;00:29:48,069;00:29:49,736;Welcome back, my lady.
285;00:29:51,027;00:29:52,444;If you'd follow me...
286;00:29:52,527;00:29:53,736;The Karstarks.
287;00:29:53,819;00:29:55,985;One of the better sigils.
288;00:29:57,152;00:29:58,527;Beats an onion, anyway.
289;00:30:00,027;00:30:01,611;Can't argue with that.
290;00:30:01,694;00:30:03,819;Not so long ago,
290;00:30:01,694;00:30:03,819;the Starks and the Karstarks
291;00:30:03,903;00:30:06,277;were slaughtering each other
291;00:30:03,903;00:30:06,277;on the battlefield.
292;00:30:06,361;00:30:08,361;Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.
293;00:30:08,444;00:30:10,402;And our queen is grateful.
294;00:30:10,486;00:30:13,736;Her gratitude is lovely,
294;00:30:10,486;00:30:13,736;but that's not my point.
295;00:30:13,819;00:30:16,861;The Northmen are loyal
295;00:30:13,819;00:30:16,861;to Jon Snow, not to her.
296;00:30:16,944;00:30:18,027;They don't know her.
297;00:30:18,110;00:30:20,444;The Free Folk don't know her.
298;00:30:20,527;00:30:23,361;I've been up here a while,
298;00:30:20,527;00:30:23,361;and I'm telling you,
299;00:30:23,444;00:30:25,277;they're stubborn as goats.
300;00:30:25,361;00:30:27,985;You want their loyalty,
300;00:30:25,361;00:30:27,985;you have to earn it.
301;00:30:39,402;00:30:41,903;I sense that you're leading
301;00:30:39,402;00:30:41,903;to a proposal.
302;00:30:43,069;00:30:45,694;A proposal is what I'm proposing.
303;00:30:45,778;00:30:49,152;On the off chance
303;00:30:45,778;00:30:49,152;that we survive the Night King,
304;00:30:49,235;00:30:50,778;what if the Seven Kingdoms,
305;00:30:50,861;00:30:53,277;for once in their whole shit history,
306;00:30:53,361;00:30:56,903;were ruled by a just woman
306;00:30:53,361;00:30:56,903;and an honorable man?
307;00:30:59,361;00:31:01,194;They do make a handsome couple.
308;00:31:01,277;00:31:03,027;You overestimate our influence.
309;00:31:03,110;00:31:06,486;Jon and Daenerys don't want
309;00:31:03,110;00:31:06,486;to listen to lonely old men.
310;00:31:06,569;00:31:08,277;I'm not that old.
311;00:31:09,569;00:31:10,985;Not as old as him.
312;00:31:12,778;00:31:15,152;Our queen respects the wisdom of age.
313;00:31:15,235;00:31:16,611;Of course she does.
314;00:31:16,694;00:31:19,444;Respect is how the young
314;00:31:16,694;00:31:19,444;keep us at a distance,
315;00:31:19,527;00:31:23,027;so we don't remind them
315;00:31:19,527;00:31:23,027;of an unpleasant truth.
316;00:31:23,110;00:31:24,319;What is that?
317;00:31:25,444;00:31:26,819;Nothing lasts.
318;00:31:28,361;00:31:29,444;Hey!
319;00:31:35,819;00:31:38,277;Your sister doesn't like me.
320;00:31:42,819;00:31:44,069;She doesn't know you.
321;00:31:45,985;00:31:47,444;If it makes you feel any better,
322;00:31:47,527;00:31:49,337;she didn't like me either
322;00:31:47,527;00:31:49,337;when we were growing up.
323;00:31:49,361;00:31:51,486;She doesn't need to be my friend...
324;00:31:53,069;00:31:54,985;but I am her queen.
325;00:31:58,486;00:32:00,444;If she can't respect me...
326;00:32:19,319;00:32:20,569;What's the matter?
327;00:32:20,653;00:32:23,152;The dragons are barely eating.
328;00:32:40,527;00:32:41,819;What's wrong with them?
329;00:32:41,903;00:32:43,486;They don't like the North.
330;00:32:59,736;00:33:00,861;Go on.
331;00:33:06,861;00:33:09,319;I don't know how to ride a dragon.
332;00:33:09,402;00:33:11,903;Nobody does.
332;00:33:09,402;00:33:11,903;Until they ride a dragon.
333;00:33:14,402;00:33:15,903;What if he doesn't want me to?
334;00:33:15,985;00:33:18,903;Then I've enjoyed your company,
334;00:33:15,985;00:33:18,903;Jon Snow.
335;00:33:38,402;00:33:40,027;What do I hold onto?
336;00:33:41,486;00:33:42,861;Whatever you can.
337;00:34:59,778;00:35:00,778;Aah!
338;00:35:39,319;00:35:41,653;You've completely ruined horses for me.
339;00:35:50,736;00:35:52,861;We could stay a thousand years...
340;00:35:55,027;00:35:56,361;no one would find us.
341;00:35:58,903;00:36:00,235;We'd be pretty old.
342;00:36:08,402;00:36:11,444;It's cold up here for a southern girl.
343;00:36:11,527;00:36:13,235;So keep your queen warm.
344;00:36:27,944;00:36:29,069;Don't be afraid.
345;00:36:42,611;00:36:43,778;That's good.
346;00:36:52,736;00:36:54,486;Gendry?
346;00:36:52,736;00:36:54,486;He's here.
347;00:37:00,611;00:37:03,486;It isn't easy making a blade
347;00:37:00,611;00:37:03,486;that big with dragonglass.
348;00:37:05,653;00:37:07,944;You're saying you're good, is that it?
349;00:37:08,027;00:37:10,027;I'm just saying
349;00:37:08,027;00:37:10,027;it's a tricky material to...
350;00:37:10,110;00:37:13,152;You know who makes weapons
350;00:37:10,110;00:37:13,152;for the wildlings?
351;00:37:13,235;00:37:15,611;Cripples and cocksuckers.
352;00:37:15,694;00:37:18,277;Which one are you?
352;00:37:15,694;00:37:18,277;Leave him be.
353;00:37:25,486;00:37:27,069;I heard you were here.
354;00:37:29,653;00:37:31,110;You left me to die.
355;00:37:32,152;00:37:33,819;First I robbed you.
356;00:37:45,277;00:37:47,611;You're a cold little bitch, aren't you?
357;00:37:51,152;00:37:53,361;Guess that's why you're still alive.
358;00:38:01,069;00:38:03,653;That was a nice ax you made for him.
359;00:38:03,736;00:38:04,944;You've gotten better.
360;00:38:05,027;00:38:07,486;Yeah, thanks. So have you.
361;00:38:08,694;00:38:11,027;I mean, you look good.
362;00:38:12,527;00:38:14,527;Thanks. So do you.
363;00:38:18,194;00:38:21,027;It's not a bad place to grow up,
363;00:38:18,194;00:38:21,027;if it wasn't so cold.
364;00:38:22,361;00:38:24,069;Stay close to that forge, then.
365;00:38:24,152;00:38:27,778;Is that a command, Lady Stark?
365;00:38:24,152;00:38:27,778;Don't call me that.
366;00:38:27,861;00:38:30,027;As you wish, milady.
367;00:38:37,319;00:38:38,527;Here's my wish.
368;00:38:40,861;00:38:41,985;Can you make it?
369;00:38:42,069;00:38:44,235;What do you need
369;00:38:42,069;00:38:44,235;something like this for?
370;00:38:44,319;00:38:45,569;Can you make it or not?
371;00:38:45,653;00:38:48,527;You already have a sword.
371;00:38:45,653;00:38:48,527;What's that?
372;00:38:55,152;00:38:56,486;It's Valyrian steel.
373;00:38:56,569;00:38:58,944;I always knew
373;00:38:56,569;00:38:58,944;you were just another rich girl.
374;00:39:00,903;00:39:03,444;You don't know any other rich girls.
375;00:39:13,944;00:39:14,944;Come in.
376;00:39:22,486;00:39:24,235;Lord Glover wishes us good fortune,
377;00:39:24,319;00:39:27,653;but he's staying
377;00:39:24,319;00:39:27,653;in Deepwood Motte with his men.
378;00:39:30,235;00:39:32,486;House Glover will stand
378;00:39:30,235;00:39:32,486;behind House Stark
379;00:39:32,569;00:39:34,944;as we have
379;00:39:32,569;00:39:34,944;for a thousand years.
380;00:39:36,110;00:39:37,402;Isn't that what he said?
381;00:39:37,486;00:39:40,402;I will stand behind Jon Snow,
381;00:39:37,486;00:39:40,402;he said.
382;00:39:41,944;00:39:43,277;The King in the North.
383;00:39:44,402;00:39:46,152;I told you we needed allies.
384;00:39:46,235;00:39:49,486;You didn't tell me you were
384;00:39:46,235;00:39:49,486;going to abandon your crown.
385;00:39:49,569;00:39:51,694;I never wanted a crown.
386;00:39:51,778;00:39:54,527;All I wanted was to protect the North.
387;00:39:54,611;00:39:57,361;I brought two armies
387;00:39:54,611;00:39:57,361;home with me, two dragons.
388;00:39:57,444;00:39:59,110;And a Targaryen queen.
389;00:39:59,194;00:40:00,569;Do you think
390;00:40:00,653;00:40:02,861;we can beat the Army of the Dead
390;00:40:00,653;00:40:02,861;without her?
391;00:40:02,944;00:40:05,903;I fought them, Sansa. Twice.
392;00:40:05,985;00:40:08,194;You want to worry about
392;00:40:05,985;00:40:08,194;who holds what title,
393;00:40:08,277;00:40:10,736;I'm telling you it doesn't matter.
394;00:40:10,819;00:40:13,486;Without her, we don't stand a chance.
395;00:40:22,402;00:40:24,985;Do you have any faith in me at all?
396;00:40:26,569;00:40:27,861;You know I do.
397;00:40:32,319;00:40:33,944;She'll be a good queen.
398;00:40:35,027;00:40:36,110;For all of us.
399;00:40:37,778;00:40:39,277;She's not her father.
400;00:40:45,819;00:40:47,486;No, she's much prettier.
401;00:40:52,985;00:40:55,444;Did you bend the knee to save the North
402;00:40:55,527;00:40:57,027;or because you love her?
403;00:41:21,027;00:41:22,319;Oh!
404;00:41:25,736;00:41:26,985;So you're the man?
405;00:41:27,069;00:41:28,527;Um...
406;00:41:28,611;00:41:30,653;Which man am I, Your Grace?
407;00:41:30,736;00:41:33,985;The one who saved Ser Jorah
407;00:41:30,736;00:41:33,985;when no one else could.
408;00:41:34,069;00:41:36,235;They could, they just wouldn't.
409;00:41:37,569;00:41:39,486;I'll have to make some changes
410;00:41:39,569;00:41:41,319;in the Citadel when I take my throne.
411;00:41:41,402;00:41:43,985;A great service merits a great reward.
412;00:41:44,069;00:41:46,736;Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace.
413;00:41:46,819;00:41:49,861;Well, there must be something
413;00:41:46,819;00:41:49,861;I could give you.
414;00:41:51,235;00:41:53,985;If it's not too much trouble,
415;00:41:54,069;00:41:56,486;I could use a pardon.
416;00:41:56,569;00:41:57,819;For what crime?
417;00:41:57,903;00:41:59,069;Um...
418;00:41:59,152;00:42:01,903;I borrowed a few books
418;00:41:59,152;00:42:01,903;from the Citadel.
419;00:42:04,277;00:42:06,319;And also a sword.
420;00:42:06,402;00:42:08,861;From the Citadel?
420;00:42:06,402;00:42:08,861;From my family.
421;00:42:10,402;00:42:12,277;It's been in House Tarly
421;00:42:10,402;00:42:12,277;for generations.
422;00:42:12,361;00:42:15,444;It would've been mine
422;00:42:12,361;00:42:15,444;anyway, eventually,
423;00:42:15,527;00:42:18,486;but my father had other ideas.
424;00:42:20,861;00:42:22,235;Not Randyll Tarly?
425;00:42:24,194;00:42:25,611;You know him?
426;00:42:29,486;00:42:32,194;I offered to let him
426;00:42:29,486;00:42:32,194;retain his lands and titles
427;00:42:32,277;00:42:33,361;if he bent the knee.
428;00:42:36,444;00:42:37,569;He refused.
429;00:42:47,277;00:42:48,611;Well...
430;00:42:50,778;00:42:52,694;At least I'll be allowed home again,
431;00:42:52,778;00:42:54,444;now that my brother's the lord.
432;00:42:58,486;00:43:00,944;Your brother stood with your father.
433;00:43:15,361;00:43:16,486;Hm.
434;00:43:17,985;00:43:19,903;Thank you, Your Grace.
435;00:43:19,985;00:43:21,402;For telling me.
436;00:43:21,486;00:43:23,235;And m...
437;00:43:23,319;00:43:25,861;May I...?
437;00:43:23,319;00:43:25,861;Of course.
438;00:44:08,653;00:44:10,527;What are you doing out here?
439;00:44:11,736;00:44:14,027;Waiting, for an old friend.
440;00:44:15,361;00:44:17,444;It's time to tell Jon the truth.
441;00:44:18,486;00:44:20,486;No, no.
442;00:44:20,569;00:44:24,444;You're his brother.
442;00:44:20,569;00:44:24,444;Shouldn't you tell him?
443;00:44:24,527;00:44:26,653;I'm not his brother.
444;00:44:26,736;00:44:29,027;He trusts you more than anyone.
445;00:44:30,069;00:44:32,069;Now's the time.
446;00:45:07,152;00:45:08,611;Sam?
447;00:45:08,694;00:45:12,486;I'm sorry, I know I'm not
447;00:45:08,694;00:45:12,486;supposed to be down here.
448;00:45:15,736;00:45:18,110;Were you hiding from me?
448;00:45:15,736;00:45:18,110;Of course not.
449;00:45:19,277;00:45:21,361;What are you doing in Winterfell?
450;00:45:21,444;00:45:24,110;Or did you read every book
450;00:45:21,444;00:45:24,110;in the Citadel already?
451;00:45:27,611;00:45:29,319;What's wrong?
452;00:45:29,402;00:45:30,861;Gilly? Is she all right?
453;00:45:30,944;00:45:32,778;She's good.
453;00:45:30,944;00:45:32,778;Little Sam?
454;00:45:34,903;00:45:35,903;Don't you know?
455;00:45:37,277;00:45:38,402;Know what?
456;00:45:39,819;00:45:40,819;Daenerys...
457;00:45:41,985;00:45:45,152;she executed my father and brother.
458;00:45:45,235;00:45:46,819;They were her prisoners.
459;00:45:50,778;00:45:52,819;She didn't tell you.
460;00:46:01,194;00:46:02,486;I'm so sorry.
461;00:46:05,985;00:46:07,694;We need to end this war.
462;00:46:09,444;00:46:11,027;Would you have done it?
463;00:46:13,110;00:46:15,069;Well, I've executed men
463;00:46:13,110;00:46:15,069;who disobeyed me.
464;00:46:15,152;00:46:16,861;You've also spared men.
465;00:46:16,944;00:46:19,527;Thousands of wildlings
465;00:46:16,944;00:46:19,527;when they refused to kneel.
466;00:46:19,611;00:46:21,069;I wasn't a king.
467;00:46:23,444;00:46:24,486;But you were.
468;00:46:26,194;00:46:27,527;You've always been.
469;00:46:29,486;00:46:31,194;I gave up my crown, Sam.
470;00:46:31,985;00:46:32,985;I bent the knee.
471;00:46:33,069;00:46:34,611;I'm not King in the North anymore.
472;00:46:34,694;00:46:36,337;I'm not talking about
472;00:46:34,694;00:46:36,337;the King in the North.
473;00:46:36,361;00:46:39,611;I'm talking about the King
473;00:46:36,361;00:46:39,611;of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.
474;00:46:47,194;00:46:48,903;Bran and I worked it out.
475;00:46:48,985;00:46:51,819;I had a High Septon's diary.
475;00:46:48,985;00:46:51,819;Bran had...
476;00:46:52,944;00:46:54,277;whatever Bran has.
477;00:46:54,361;00:46:56,319;What are you talking about?
478;00:46:59,444;00:47:00,486;Your mother...
479;00:47:01,653;00:47:02,985;was Lyanna Stark.
480;00:47:04,569;00:47:05,903;And your father...
481;00:47:07,194;00:47:09,152;your real father
482;00:47:09,235;00:47:10,903;was Rhaegar Targaryen.
483;00:47:13,069;00:47:15,694;You've never been a bastard.
484;00:47:15,778;00:47:19,527;You're Aegon Targaryen,
484;00:47:15,778;00:47:19,527;true heir to the Iron Throne.
485;00:47:23,778;00:47:26,569;I'm sorry,
485;00:47:23,778;00:47:26,569;I know it's a lot to take in.
486;00:47:35,778;00:47:39,110;My father was the most
486;00:47:35,778;00:47:39,110;honorable man I ever met.
487;00:47:42,653;00:47:44,736;You're saying
487;00:47:42,653;00:47:44,736;he lied to me all my life.
488;00:47:44,819;00:47:45,944;No.
489;00:47:46,944;00:47:50,444;Your father... Well, Ned Stark.
490;00:47:50,527;00:47:53,903;He promised your mother
490;00:47:50,527;00:47:53,903;he'd always protect you.
491;00:47:53,985;00:47:56,778;And he did. Robert would have
491;00:47:53,985;00:47:56,778;murdered you if he knew.
492;00:47:58,778;00:48:00,277;You're the true king.
493;00:48:01,444;00:48:03,319;Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name,
494;00:48:03,402;00:48:05,402;Protector of the Realm, all of it.
495;00:48:19,944;00:48:22,903;Daenerys is our queen.
495;00:48:19,944;00:48:22,903;She shouldn't be.
496;00:48:24,819;00:48:26,819;That's treason.
496;00:48:24,819;00:48:26,819;It's the truth.
497;00:48:28,569;00:48:31,152;You gave up your crown
497;00:48:28,569;00:48:31,152;to save your people.
498;00:48:32,819;00:48:34,486;Would she do the same?
499;00:50:42,694;00:50:44,361;Stay back, he's got blue eyes!
500;00:50:44,444;00:50:46,069;I've always had blue eyes!
501;00:50:56,110;00:50:57,277;Did you find anyone?
502;00:51:30,653;00:51:32,819;The Umber boy.
503;00:51:32,903;00:51:34,027;It's a message.
504;00:51:35,152;00:51:36,736;From the Night King.
505;00:51:36,819;00:51:40,486;His army's between us
505;00:51:36,819;00:51:40,486;and Winterfell. We're on foot.
506;00:51:40,569;00:51:42,402;We rode down from Castle Black.
507;00:51:42,486;00:51:44,736;We can double up on the horses.
508;00:51:44,819;00:51:48,736;If the horses last,
508;00:51:44,819;00:51:48,736;we'll get there before the dead.
509;00:51:48,819;00:51:49,944;We just have to hope
510;00:51:50,027;00:51:51,736;the Night King doesn't come first.
511;00:52:43,402;00:52:45,944;Keep moving! Straight up!
512;00:52:47,819;00:52:50,736;Stay together!
512;00:52:47,819;00:52:50,736;Don't fall behind!
513;00:55:05,861;00:55:07,694;When I was a child,
513;00:55:05,861;00:55:07,694;my brother would tell me
514;00:55:07,778;00:55:11,235;a bedtime story, about the man
514;00:55:07,778;00:55:11,235;who murdered our father.
515;00:55:12,569;00:55:15,027;About all the things we would
515;00:55:12,569;00:55:15,027;do to that man.
516;00:55:17,694;00:55:19,277;You never should have trusted Cersei.
517;00:55:19,361;00:55:20,861;You never should have either.
518;00:55:22,152;00:55:23,319;Death...
519;00:55:23,903;00:55:27,277;it's got many faces, I look
519;00:55:23,903;00:55:27,277;forward to seeing this one.
520;00:55:28,653;00:55:29,736;How long do we have?
521;00:55:34,569;00:55:36,569;Before the sun comes up tomorrow.
