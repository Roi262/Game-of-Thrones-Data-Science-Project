2;00:00:05,700;00:00:07,100;They have declared war on Dorne.
3;00:00:07,242;00:00:10,450;We must be allies now,
3;00:00:07,242;00:00:10,450;if we wish to survive.
4;00:00:10,570;00:00:13,534;I offer vengeance... justice...
5;00:00:13,991;00:00:15,391;Fire and blood.
6;00:00:17,200;00:00:18,241;I traveled south
7;00:00:18,242;00:00:19,991;under orders from the Lord Commander.
8;00:00:20,325;00:00:22,325;You ought to be a Maester.
9;00:00:22,534;00:00:24,740;Spending your life reading

10;00:00:24,741;00:00:26,141;of better men.
11;00:00:26,242;00:00:27,740;It's a map of Dragonstone.
12;00:00:27,741;00:00:28,866;That's dragonglass.
13;00:00:29,117;00:00:30,597;A mountain of it, beneath the ground.
14;00:00:30,700;00:00:32,100;Jon needs to know.
15;00:00:32,617;00:00:33,617;You must send me away.
16;00:00:33,866;00:00:35,782;I command you to heal yourself.
17;00:00:35,783;00:00:38,075;I command you to find the cure.
18;00:00:44,950;00:00:48,075;So why's a nice girl on her own
18;00:00:44,950;00:00:48,075;heading to King's Landing?
19;00:00:48,492;00:00:49,908;I'm going to kill the queen.
20;00:00:51,409;00:00:53,199;I invited Euron Greyjoy,
21;00:00:53,200;00:00:54,866;the new king of the Iron Islands.
22;00:00:57,325;00:01:00,741;The Iron Fleet is the greatest

27;00:03:38,908;00:03:41,699;you came into the world.
28;00:03:41,700;00:03:42,990;I remember that storm.
29;00:03:42,991;00:03:45,740;All the dogs in King's Landing
30;00:03:45,741;00:03:47,740;howled through the night.
31;00:03:47,741;00:03:49,366;I wish I could remember it.
32;00:03:49,367;00:03:52,282;I always thought this
32;00:03:49,367;00:03:52,282;would be a homecoming.
33;00:03:52,283;00:03:54,074;Doesn't feel like home.
34;00:03:54,075;00:03:56,408;We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.
35;00:03:56,409;00:03:57,809;Good.
36;00:03:59,117;00:04:00,949;Not so many lions.
37;00:04:00,950;00:04:03,865;Cersei controls fewer
37;00:04:00,950;00:04:03,865;than half the Seven Kingdoms.

40;00:04:09,033;00:04:12,533;They cry out for their true queen?
41;00:04:12,534;00:04:15,157;They drink secret toasts to my health?
42;00:04:15,158;00:04:17,116;People used to tell my
42;00:04:15,158;00:04:17,116;brother that sort of thing,
43;00:04:17,117;00:04:19,158;and he was stupid
43;00:04:17,117;00:04:19,158;enough to believe them.
44;00:04:23,950;00:04:27,990;If Viserys had three dragons
44;00:04:23,950;00:04:27,990;and an army at his back,
45;00:04:27,991;00:04:29,990;he'd have invaded
45;00:04:27,991;00:04:29,990;King's Landing already.
46;00:04:29,991;00:04:32,574;Conquering Westeros
46;00:04:29,991;00:04:32,574;would be easy for you.

48;00:04:36,617;00:04:37,740;No.
49;00:04:37,741;00:04:39,990;We can take the Seven Kingdoms
50;00:04:39,991;00:04:42,865;without turning it

54;00:04:49,991;00:04:53,157;we have powerful allies in the south.
55;00:04:53,158;00:04:55,740;I never properly thanked you for that.
56;00:04:55,741;00:04:58,491;They joined our side, my queen,
57;00:04:58,492;00:05:01,032;because they believe in you.
58;00:05:01,033;00:05:03,367;You served my father,
58;00:05:01,033;00:05:03,367;didn't you, Lord Varys?
59;00:05:04,700;00:05:05,990;I did.
60;00:05:05,991;00:05:07,324;And then you served the
60;00:05:05,991;00:05:07,324;man who overthrew him.
61;00:05:07,325;00:05:09,074;I had a choice, Your Grace...
62;00:05:09,075;00:05:11,199;serve Robert Baratheon or
62;00:05:09,075;00:05:11,199;face the headman's axe.
63;00:05:11,200;00:05:13,533;But you didn't serve him long.
64;00:05:13,534;00:05:14,991;You turned against him.
65;00:05:16,450;00:05:20,157;Robert was an improvement
65;00:05:16,450;00:05:20,157;on your father, to be sure.
66;00:05:20,158;00:05:22,241;There have been few rulers in history
67;00:05:22,242;00:05:24,324;as cruel as the Mad King.
68;00:05:24,325;00:05:26,782;Robert was neither mad nor cruel.
69;00:05:26,783;00:05:29,324;He simply had no interest in being king.
70;00:05:29,325;00:05:32,032;So you took it upon yourself
70;00:05:29,325;00:05:32,032;to find a better one.
71;00:05:32,033;00:05:34,241;Your Grace,
72;00:05:34,242;00:05:37,241;when I was ready to drink
72;00:05:34,242;00:05:37,241;myself into a small coffin,
73;00:05:37,242;00:05:39,282;Lord Varys told me about a
73;00:05:37,242;00:05:39,282;queen in the east who...
74;00:05:39,283;00:05:42,200;Before I came to power,
74;00:05:39,283;00:05:42,200;you favored my brother.
75;00:05:43,617;00:05:46,907;All your spies, your little birds,
76;00:05:46,908;00:05:50,575;did they tell you Viserys was
76;00:05:46,908;00:05:50,575;cruel, stupid, and weak?
77;00:05:52,700;00:05:57,199;Would those qualities have made for a
77;00:05:52,700;00:05:57,199;good king in your learned opinion?
78;00:05:57,200;00:05:59,865;Until your marriage to
78;00:05:57,200;00:05:59,865;Khal Drogo, Your Grace,
79;00:05:59,866;00:06:02,366;I knew nothing about
79;00:05:59,866;00:06:02,366;you, save your existence
80;00:06:02,367;00:06:04,699;and that you were said to be beautiful.
81;00:06:04,700;00:06:08,408;So you and your friends traded me
81;00:06:04,700;00:06:08,408;like a prized horse to the Dothraki.
82;00:06:08,409;00:06:10,408;Which you turned to your advantage.
83;00:06:10,409;00:06:12,450;Who gave the order to kill me?
84;00:06:16,450;00:06:18,491;King Robert.
85;00:06:18,492;00:06:21,241;Who hired the assassins?
86;00:06:21,242;00:06:24,408;Who sent word to Essos to
86;00:06:21,242;00:06:24,408;murder Daenerys Targaryen?
87;00:06:24,409;00:06:27,183;Your Grace, I did what
87;00:06:24,409;00:06:27,183;had to be done to...
88;00:06:27,185;00:06:28,949;To keep yourself alive.
89;00:06:28,950;00:06:31,241;Lord Varys has proven
89;00:06:28,950;00:06:31,241;himself a loyal servant.
90;00:06:31,242;00:06:33,032;Proven himself loyal?
90;00:06:31,242;00:06:33,032;Quite the opposite.
91;00:06:33,033;00:06:36,740;If he dislikes one monarch, he
91;00:06:33,033;00:06:36,740;conspires to crown the next one.
92;00:06:36,741;00:06:39,157;What kind of a servant is that?
93;00:06:39,158;00:06:41,282;The kind the realm needs.
94;00:06:41,283;00:06:44,658;Incompetence should not be
94;00:06:41,283;00:06:44,658;rewarded with blind loyalty.
95;00:06:44,659;00:06:47,617;As long as I have my
95;00:06:44,659;00:06:47,617;eyes, I'll use them.
96;00:06:49,325;00:06:51,324;I wasn't born into a great house.
97;00:06:51,325;00:06:53,907;I came from nothing.
98;00:06:53,908;00:06:56,865;I was sold as a slave and
98;00:06:53,908;00:06:56,865;carved up as an offering.
99;00:06:56,866;00:07:00,699;When I was a child, I lived in
99;00:06:56,866;00:07:00,699;alleys, gutters, abandoned houses.
100;00:07:00,700;00:07:03,282;You wish to know where
100;00:07:00,700;00:07:03,282;my true loyalties lie?
101;00:07:03,283;00:07:06,491;Not with any king or queen,
101;00:07:03,283;00:07:06,491;but with the people.
102;00:07:06,492;00:07:10,449;The people who suffer under despots
102;00:07:06,492;00:07:10,449;and prosper under just rule.
103;00:07:10,450;00:07:12,825;The people whose hearts you aim to win.
104;00:07:14,617;00:07:18,533;If you demand blind allegiance,
105;00:07:18,534;00:07:21,282;I respect your wishes.
106;00:07:21,283;00:07:25,282;Grey Worm can behead me or
106;00:07:21,283;00:07:25,282;your dragons can devour me.
107;00:07:25,283;00:07:27,865;But if you let me live,
107;00:07:25,283;00:07:27,865;I will serve you well.
108;00:07:27,866;00:07:31,157;I will dedicate myself to
108;00:07:27,866;00:07:31,157;seeing you on the Iron Throne
109;00:07:31,158;00:07:33,658;because I choose you.
110;00:07:33,659;00:07:37,200;Because I know the people have
110;00:07:33,659;00:07:37,200;no better chance than you.
111;00:07:45,492;00:07:47,659;Swear this to me, Varys.
112;00:07:49,158;00:07:52,616;If you ever think I'm
112;00:07:49,158;00:07:52,616;failing the people,
113;00:07:52,617;00:07:55,824;you won't conspire behind my back.
114;00:07:55,825;00:07:57,782;You'll look me in the eye
114;00:07:55,825;00:07:57,782;as you have done today,
115;00:07:57,783;00:07:59,617;and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.
116;00:08:02,492;00:08:04,617;I swear it, my queen.
117;00:08:10,950;00:08:14,865;And I swear this... if
117;00:08:10,950;00:08:14,865;you ever betray me,
118;00:08:14,866;00:08:16,575;I'll burn you alive.
119;00:08:19,908;00:08:23,325;I would expect nothing less
119;00:08:19,908;00:08:23,325;from the Mother of Dragons.
120;00:08:26,409;00:08:28,366;Forgive me, my queen.

145;00:09:56,158;00:09:58,907;in High Valyrian,
146;00:09:58,908;00:10:01,865;so the proper translation
146;00:09:58,908;00:10:01,865;for that prophecy would be,
147;00:10:01,866;00:10:06,241;The prince or princess who was
147;00:10:01,866;00:10:06,241;promised will bring the dawn.
148;00:10:06,242;00:10:08,408;Doesn't really roll off
148;00:10:06,242;00:10:08,408;the tongue, does it?
149;00:10:08,409;00:10:09,950;No, but I like it better.
150;00:10:11,534;00:10:13,491;And you believe this
150;00:10:11,534;00:10:13,491;prophecy refers to me?
151;00:10:13,492;00:10:16,282;Prophecies are dangerous things.
152;00:10:16,283;00:10:19,616;I believe you have a role to play.
153;00:10:19,617;00:10:21,491;As does another...
154;00:10:21,492;00:10:23,991;the King in the North, Jon Snow.
155;00:10:25,283;00:10:26,699;Jon Snow?
156;00:10:26,700;00:10:29,491;Ned Stark's bastard?
156;00:10:26,700;00:10:29,491;You know him?
157;00:10:29,492;00:10:32,658;I travelled with him to the Wall
157;00:10:29,492;00:10:32,658;when he joined the Night's Watch.
158;00:10:32,659;00:10:36,782;And why do you think the Lord of
158;00:10:32,659;00:10:36,782;Light singled out this Jon Snow?
159;00:10:36,783;00:10:39,491;Aside from the visions you've
159;00:10:36,783;00:10:39,491;seen in the flames, that is.
160;00:10:39,492;00:10:42,408;As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch,
161;00:10:42,409;00:10:44,658;he allowed the wildlings
161;00:10:42,409;00:10:44,658;south of the Wall
162;00:10:44,659;00:10:46,740;to protect them from grave danger.
163;00:10:46,741;00:10:48,324;As King in the North,
164;00:10:48,325;00:10:51,157;he has united those wildlings
164;00:10:48,325;00:10:51,157;with the Northern houses,
165;00:10:51,158;00:10:53,658;so together they may
165;00:10:51,158;00:10:53,658;face their common enemy.
166;00:10:53,659;00:10:55,782;He sounds like quite a man.
167;00:10:55,783;00:10:58,157;Summon Jon Snow.
168;00:10:58,158;00:10:59,824;Let him stand before you
169;00:10:59,825;00:11:01,449;and tell you the things
169;00:10:59,825;00:11:01,449;that have happened to him,
170;00:11:01,450;00:11:05,075;the things that he has
170;00:11:01,450;00:11:05,075;seen with his own eyes.
171;00:11:06,617;00:11:08,241;I can't speak to prophecies
172;00:11:08,242;00:11:10,865;or visions in the flames,
173;00:11:10,866;00:11:13,658;but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him.
174;00:11:13,659;00:11:16,157;And I am an excellent
174;00:11:13,659;00:11:16,157;judge of character.
175;00:11:16,158;00:11:18,616;If he does rule the North,
176;00:11:18,617;00:11:20,367;he would make a valuable ally.
177;00:11:21,700;00:11:23,616;The Lannisters executed his father
178;00:11:23,617;00:11:25,782;and conspired to murder his brother.
179;00:11:25,783;00:11:28,991;Jon Snow has even more reason
179;00:11:25,783;00:11:28,991;to hate Cersei than you do.
180;00:11:33,367;00:11:35,157;Very well.
181;00:11:35,158;00:11:36,949;Send a raven north.
182;00:11:36,950;00:11:38,949;Tell Jon Snow that his queen
183;00:11:38,950;00:11:41,949;invites him to come to Dragonstone...
184;00:11:41,950;00:11:43,700;and bend the knee.
185;00:11:53,242;00:11:56,241;Gather round. Come here.
186;00:11:56,242;00:11:58,740;You think it's really Tyrion?
187;00:11:58,741;00:12:02,241;It could be someone trying
187;00:11:58,741;00:12:02,241;to lure you into a trap.
188;00:12:02,242;00:12:03,782;Read the last bit.
189;00:12:03,783;00:12:08,408;All dwarves are bastards
189;00:12:03,783;00:12:08,408;in their father's eyes.
190;00:12:08,409;00:12:10,157;What does that mean?
191;00:12:10,158;00:12:13,075;It's something he said to
191;00:12:10,158;00:12:13,075;me the first night we met.
192;00:12:14,409;00:12:16,242;You know him better than any of us.
193;00:12:17,409;00:12:18,809;What do you think?
194;00:12:21,866;00:12:24,491;Tyrion's not like the other Lannisters.
195;00:12:24,492;00:12:28,282;He was always kind to me,
195;00:12:24,492;00:12:28,282;but it's too great a risk.
196;00:12:28,283;00:12:30,282;The Seven Kingdoms will bleed
197;00:12:30,283;00:12:32,782;as long as Cersei sits
197;00:12:30,283;00:12:32,782;on the Iron Throne.
198;00:12:32,783;00:12:33,949;Join us.
199;00:12:33,950;00:12:35,783;Together, we can end her tyranny.
200;00:12:39,950;00:12:41,949;Sounds like a charmer.
201;00:12:41,950;00:12:44,157;Of course, the casual mention
201;00:12:41,950;00:12:44,157;of a Dothraki horde,
202;00:12:44,158;00:12:47,116;a legion of Unsullied,
202;00:12:44,158;00:12:47,116;and three dragons...
203;00:12:47,117;00:12:48,659;a bit less charming.
204;00:12:50,783;00:12:51,824;What?
205;00:12:51,825;00:12:55,074;Fire kills wights, you told me.
206;00:12:55,075;00:12:56,475;What breathes fire?
207;00:12:58,325;00:13:00,449;You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?
208;00:13:00,450;00:13:02,865;No, too dangerous.
208;00:13:00,450;00:13:02,865;But?
209;00:13:02,866;00:13:05,824;But if the Army of the Dead
209;00:13:02,866;00:13:05,824;makes it past the Wall,
210;00:13:05,825;00:13:08,325;do we have enough men to fight them?
211;00:13:12,659;00:13:15,032;If the Mad King's daughter
211;00:13:12,659;00:13:15,032;takes the Iron Throne,
212;00:13:15,033;00:13:16,950;she'll destroy the realm as we know it.
213;00:13:18,283;00:13:21,199;Some of you are bannermen
213;00:13:18,283;00:13:21,199;of House Tyrell.
214;00:13:21,200;00:13:24,324;But House Tyrell is in open
214;00:13:21,200;00:13:24,324;rebellion against the crown.
215;00:13:24,325;00:13:27,533;With their help, the Mad King's daughter
216;00:13:27,534;00:13:31,032;has ferried an army of
216;00:13:27,534;00:13:31,032;savages to our shores...
217;00:13:31,033;00:13:34,824;mindless Unsullied soldiers who will
217;00:13:31,033;00:13:34,824;destroy your castles and your holdfasts,
218;00:13:34,825;00:13:38,990;Dothraki heathens who will burn
218;00:13:34,825;00:13:38,990;your villages to the ground,
219;00:13:38,991;00:13:41,199;rape and enslave your women,
220;00:13:41,200;00:13:44,116;and butcher your children
220;00:13:41,200;00:13:44,116;without a second thought.
221;00:13:44,117;00:13:48,990;This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards
221;00:13:44,117;00:13:48,990;centuries of service and loyalty.
222;00:13:48,991;00:13:51,824;You all remember the Mad King.
223;00:13:51,825;00:13:55,366;You remember the horrors he
223;00:13:51,825;00:13:55,366;inflicted upon his people.
224;00:13:55,367;00:13:57,366;His daughter is no different.
225;00:13:57,367;00:14:00,157;In Essos, her brutality
225;00:13:57,367;00:14:00,157;is already legendary.
226;00:14:00,158;00:14:04,449;She crucified hundreds of
226;00:14:00,158;00:14:04,449;noblemen in Slaver's Bay.
227;00:14:04,450;00:14:07,116;And when she grew bored of that,
228;00:14:07,117;00:14:09,366;she fed them to her dragons.
229;00:14:09,367;00:14:12,949;It is my solemn duty to protect
229;00:14:09,367;00:14:12,949;the people, and I will.
230;00:14:12,950;00:14:16,116;But I need your help, my lords.
231;00:14:16,117;00:14:18,908;We must stand together, all of us...
232;00:14:20,117;00:14:22,116;if we hope to stop her.
233;00:14:27,450;00:14:30,534;She has three full-grown
233;00:14:27,450;00:14:30,534;dragons, Your Grace.
234;00:14:31,908;00:14:33,699;The same as Aegon when he conquered
235;00:14:33,700;00:14:36,199;the Seven Kingdoms.
236;00:14:36,200;00:14:38,575;How do you propose to stop them?
237;00:14:42,242;00:14:46,367;We are currently at work
237;00:14:42,242;00:14:46,367;on a solution, my lord.
238;00:14:53,242;00:14:54,642;Lord Tarly.
239;00:14:56,075;00:14:57,990;Ser Jaime.
240;00:14:57,991;00:14:59,699;I believe you know my son.
241;00:14:59,700;00:15:00,700;Ser Jaime.
242;00:15:00,701;00:15:02,199;Rickard, isn't it?
243;00:15:02,200;00:15:03,907;Dickon.
244;00:15:03,908;00:15:05,449;That's it.
245;00:15:05,450;00:15:07,449;Thank you for coming.
246;00:15:07,450;00:15:11,366;The other lords of the Reach look to
246;00:15:07,450;00:15:11,366;you for guidance, now more than ever.
247;00:15:11,367;00:15:13,074;They might not have come if you hadn't.
248;00:15:13,075;00:15:16,366;If my queen summons me,
248;00:15:13,075;00:15:16,366;I answer the call.
249;00:15:16,367;00:15:19,158;And I've heard what she
249;00:15:16,367;00:15:19,158;does to those who defy her.
250;00:15:22,033;00:15:24,408;You ride for Horn Hill today?
251;00:15:24,409;00:15:27,116;I have an army to mobilize.
252;00:15:27,117;00:15:29,449;Won't be long before
252;00:15:27,117;00:15:29,449;the fighting starts.
253;00:15:29,450;00:15:31,908;And which side will you be fighting for?
254;00:15:33,492;00:15:36,241;You were the only man to defeat
254;00:15:33,492;00:15:36,241;Robert Baratheon in battle.
255;00:15:36,242;00:15:38,157;Not even Rhaegar
255;00:15:36,242;00:15:38,157;Targaryen could do that.
256;00:15:38,158;00:15:41,116;It's a long ride back to the
256;00:15:38,158;00:15:41,116;Reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?
257;00:15:41,117;00:15:44,074;I want you to be my ranking
257;00:15:41,117;00:15:44,074;general in the wars to come.
258;00:15:44,075;00:15:46,199;I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei
259;00:15:46,200;00:15:49,199;and I want you to help
259;00:15:46,200;00:15:49,199;me destroy her enemies.
260;00:15:49,200;00:15:51,032;All her enemies.
261;00:15:51,033;00:15:53,075;Including Olenna Tyrell.
262;00:15:55,825;00:15:58,324;I'm a Tarly.
263;00:15:58,325;00:15:59,825;That name means something.
264;00:16:01,325;00:16:03,865;We're not oathbreakers.
264;00:16:01,325;00:16:03,865;We're not schemers.
265;00:16:03,866;00:16:06,324;We don't stab our rivals in the back
266;00:16:06,325;00:16:09,158;or cut their throats at weddings.
267;00:16:11,283;00:16:14,199;I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
268;00:16:14,200;00:16:17,534;You swore an oath to the
268;00:16:14,200;00:16:17,534;crown as well, Lord Tarly.
269;00:16:18,950;00:16:21,324;I've known Olenna since I was a child.
270;00:16:21,325;00:16:23,949;She was a great woman once.
271;00:16:23,950;00:16:26,324;Now she's broken.
272;00:16:26,325;00:16:28,449;She wants revenge so badly,
273;00:16:28,450;00:16:30,699;she brought the Dothraki to our shores.
274;00:16:30,700;00:16:34,617;The Dothraki in Westeros for
274;00:16:30,700;00:16:34,617;the first time in history.
275;00:16:37,283;00:16:39,533;I know you don't like my sister,
276;00:16:39,534;00:16:42,699;but you have to make a choice.
277;00:16:42,700;00:16:44,740;Do you fight with us
278;00:16:44,741;00:16:46,866;or with foreign savages and eunuchs?
279;00:16:52,117;00:16:54,366;When the war is won,
280;00:16:54,367;00:16:57,533;the queen will need a new
280;00:16:54,367;00:16:57,533;Warden of the South.
281;00:16:57,534;00:17:00,366;I can think of no better man
282;00:17:00,367;00:17:02,200;than Randyll Tarly.
283;00:17:04,242;00:17:07,032;The infection
283;00:17:04,242;00:17:07,032;has spread too far.
284;00:17:07,033;00:17:09,991;You should have cut off your arm
284;00:17:07,033;00:17:09,991;the moment you were touched.
285;00:17:12,700;00:17:14,100;How long?
286;00:17:16,575;00:17:18,699;It'll be years before it kills you.
287;00:17:18,700;00:17:20,282;Could be 10.
288;00:17:20,283;00:17:21,949;Could be 20.
289;00:17:21,950;00:17:23,700;But how long until...?
290;00:17:25,117;00:17:27,199;Your mind?
291;00:17:27,200;00:17:30,075;Six months, maybe fewer.
292;00:17:42,741;00:17:44,141;Um...
293;00:17:45,409;00:17:48,574;Pardon, Archmaester.
294;00:17:48,575;00:17:51,574;I met Stannis Baratheon's
294;00:17:48,575;00:17:51,574;daughter at Castle Black.
295;00:17:51,575;00:17:54,032;She had the greyscale as
295;00:17:51,575;00:17:54,032;a baby and was cured.
296;00:17:54,033;00:17:55,616;No.
296;00:17:54,033;00:17:55,616;Isn't there some way...
297;00:17:55,617;00:17:57,408;Does this look
297;00:17:55,617;00:17:57,408;like a baby to you?
298;00:17:57,409;00:17:58,740;No.
298;00:17:57,409;00:17:58,740;Have you studied
299;00:17:58,741;00:18:00,782;the varying rates of
299;00:17:58,741;00:18:00,782;greyscale progression
300;00:18:00,783;00:18:02,409;in infants and fully grown men?
301;00:18:04,450;00:18:05,850;No.
302;00:18:07,617;00:18:09,199;Maester Cressen discovered
303;00:18:09,200;00:18:11,783;Shireen Baratheon's
303;00:18:09,200;00:18:11,783;affliction immediately.
304;00:18:13,242;00:18:14,950;This is quite advanced.
305;00:18:16,783;00:18:18,991;And beyond our skills, ser.
306;00:18:22,450;00:18:25,408;Were you a commoner, I'd have
306;00:18:22,450;00:18:25,408;you shipped to Valyria at once
307;00:18:25,409;00:18:27,949;to live out your life
307;00:18:25,409;00:18:27,949;with the stone men.
308;00:18:27,950;00:18:31,783;As an anointed knight, I'll
308;00:18:27,950;00:18:31,783;allow you one more day.
309;00:18:34,575;00:18:37,117;How you choose to spend
309;00:18:34,575;00:18:37,117;that time is up to you.
310;00:18:43,617;00:18:45,017;Come, Samwell.
311;00:18:48,492;00:18:51,367;Should we send word to
311;00:18:48,492;00:18:51,367;your family, Ser...?
312;00:18:52,991;00:18:54,391;Jorah.
313;00:18:55,825;00:18:58,324;Jorah Mormont.
314;00:18:58,325;00:19:00,366;Mormont?
315;00:19:00,367;00:19:02,116;There's no need.
316;00:19:02,117;00:19:04,700;I've been dead to them for years.
317;00:19:06,367;00:19:08,033;Come, Samwell!
318;00:19:20,991;00:19:23,907;Have you ever been
318;00:19:20,991;00:19:23,907;down here, Your Grace?
319;00:19:23,908;00:19:25,409;No, I can't say I have.
320;00:19:27,659;00:19:31,116;I haven't seen these since Robert had
320;00:19:27,659;00:19:31,116;them removed from the throne room.
321;00:19:31,117;00:19:35,074;Curious that King Robert did
321;00:19:31,117;00:19:35,074;not have them destroyed.
322;00:19:35,075;00:19:37,241;They were his trophies.
323;00:19:37,242;00:19:38,449;He couldn't keep them around.
324;00:19:38,450;00:19:40,366;They would have made him look small.
325;00:19:40,367;00:19:43,908;Sometimes he would come
325;00:19:40,367;00:19:43,908;down here and look at them.
326;00:19:46,367;00:19:49,075;I believe he brought his
326;00:19:46,367;00:19:49,075;whores on occasion.
327;00:19:56,409;00:19:58,200;Balerion the Dread.
328;00:20:00,033;00:20:02,616;The beast that Aegon
328;00:20:00,033;00:20:02,616;rode across the sea.
329;00:20:02,617;00:20:05,533;His flames forged the Iron Throne
330;00:20:05,534;00:20:08,409;and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.
331;00:20:09,575;00:20:10,975;Powerful...
332;00:20:11,866;00:20:13,283;but not invincible.
333;00:20:17,741;00:20:21,074;Apparently, one of Daenerys's dragons
334;00:20:21,075;00:20:24,741;was wounded by spears in the
334;00:20:21,075;00:20:24,741;fighting pits of Meereen.
335;00:20:26,242;00:20:28,574;And if they can be wounded,
336;00:20:28,575;00:20:29,975;they can be killed.
337;00:20:32,242;00:20:35,241;The finest artillators and
337;00:20:32,242;00:20:35,241;blacksmiths in King's Landing
338;00:20:35,242;00:20:38,075;have been laboring day
338;00:20:35,242;00:20:38,075;and night, Your Grace.
339;00:20:44,617;00:20:47,117;If you'll kindly pull that lever.
340;00:21:03,575;00:21:06,117;If you want the
340;00:21:03,575;00:21:06,117;Iron Throne, take it.
341;00:21:08,200;00:21:11,282;We have an army, a fleet,
341;00:21:08,200;00:21:11,282;and three dragons.
342;00:21:11,283;00:21:14,949;We should hit King's Landing now,
342;00:21:11,283;00:21:14,949;hard, with everything we have.
343;00:21:14,950;00:21:17,449;The city will fall within a day.
344;00:21:17,450;00:21:20,366;If we turn the dragons loose, tens of
344;00:21:17,450;00:21:20,366;thousands will die in the firestorms.
345;00:21:20,367;00:21:21,949;It's called war.
346;00:21:21,950;00:21:24,949;You don't have the stomach for
346;00:21:21,950;00:21:24,949;it, scurry back into hiding.
347;00:21:24,950;00:21:26,282;I know how you wage war.
348;00:21:26,283;00:21:29,032;We don't poison little girls here.
349;00:21:29,033;00:21:30,324;Myrcella was innocent.
350;00:21:30,325;00:21:31,699;She was a Lannister.
351;00:21:31,700;00:21:34,324;There are no innocent Lannisters.
352;00:21:34,325;00:21:37,616;My greatest regret is that
352;00:21:34,325;00:21:37,616;Oberyn died fighting for you.
353;00:21:37,617;00:21:39,491;That's enough.
354;00:21:39,492;00:21:41,074;Lord Tyrion is Hand of the Queen.
355;00:21:41,075;00:21:42,492;You will treat him with respect.
356;00:21:46,450;00:21:49,492;I am not here to be queen of the ashes.
357;00:21:50,741;00:21:52,907;That's very nice to hear.
358;00:21:52,908;00:21:54,865;Of course, I can't remember a queen
359;00:21:54,866;00:21:57,824;who was better loved
359;00:21:54,866;00:21:57,824;than my granddaughter.
360;00:21:57,825;00:21:59,782;The common people loved her.
361;00:21:59,783;00:22:01,533;The nobles loved her.
362;00:22:01,534;00:22:03,282;And what is left of her now?
363;00:22:03,283;00:22:06,116;Ashes.
364;00:22:06,117;00:22:07,824;Commoners, nobles,
365;00:22:07,825;00:22:09,699;they're all just children, really.
366;00:22:09,700;00:22:13,325;They won't obey you
366;00:22:09,700;00:22:13,325;unless they fear you.
367;00:22:15,325;00:22:17,574;I'm grateful to you, Lady
367;00:22:15,325;00:22:17,574;Olenna, for your counsel.
368;00:22:17,575;00:22:19,491;I'm grateful to all of you.
369;00:22:19,492;00:22:22,116;But you have chosen to follow me.
370;00:22:22,117;00:22:24,491;I will not attack King's Landing.
371;00:22:24,492;00:22:27,324;We will not attack King's Landing.
372;00:22:27,325;00:22:30,990;Then how do you mean to
372;00:22:27,325;00:22:30,990;take the Iron Throne?
373;00:22:30,991;00:22:32,391;By asking nicely?
374;00:22:34,450;00:22:35,865;We will lay siege to the capital,
375;00:22:35,866;00:22:37,574;surrounding the city on all sides.
376;00:22:37,575;00:22:39,366;Cersei will have the Iron Throne,
377;00:22:39,367;00:22:41,740;but no food for her army or the people.
378;00:22:41,741;00:22:44,658;But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.
379;00:22:44,659;00:22:46,699;Cersei will try to rally
379;00:22:44,659;00:22:46,699;the lords of Westeros
380;00:22:46,700;00:22:48,366;by appealing to their loyalty,
381;00:22:48,367;00:22:50,032;their love for their country.
382;00:22:50,033;00:22:51,949;If we besiege the city with foreigners,
383;00:22:51,950;00:22:53,658;we prove her point.
384;00:22:53,659;00:22:55,282;Our army should be Westerosi.
385;00:22:55,283;00:22:57,574;And I suppose we're
385;00:22:55,283;00:22:57,574;providing the Westerosi?
386;00:22:57,575;00:22:58,865;You are.
387;00:22:58,866;00:23:02,242;Lady Greyjoy will escort
387;00:22:58,866;00:23:02,242;you home to Sunspear.
388;00:23:05,158;00:23:08,241;And her Iron Fleet will
388;00:23:05,158;00:23:08,241;ferry the Dornish army
389;00:23:08,242;00:23:10,241;back up to King's Landing.
390;00:23:10,242;00:23:13,074;The Dornish will lay
390;00:23:10,242;00:23:13,074;siege to the capital
391;00:23:13,075;00:23:15,116;alongside the Tyrell army.
392;00:23:15,117;00:23:17,782;Two great kingdoms
392;00:23:15,117;00:23:17,782;united against Cersei.
393;00:23:17,783;00:23:22,907;So, your master plan
393;00:23:17,783;00:23:22,907;is to use our armies.
394;00:23:22,908;00:23:26,283;Forgive me for asking, but why did
394;00:23:22,908;00:23:26,283;you bother to bring your own?
395;00:23:27,741;00:23:30,782;The Unsullied will have
395;00:23:27,741;00:23:30,782;another objective.
396;00:23:30,783;00:23:34,366;For decades, House Lannister has
396;00:23:30,783;00:23:34,366;been the true power in Westeros.
397;00:23:34,367;00:23:38,533;And the seat of that
397;00:23:34,367;00:23:38,533;power is Casterly Rock.
398;00:23:38,534;00:23:40,449;Grey Worm and the Unsullied
399;00:23:40,450;00:23:43,325;will sail for the Rock and take it.
400;00:24:01,866;00:24:03,492;Do I have your support?
401;00:24:05,283;00:24:06,683;You have mine.
402;00:24:08,450;00:24:10,325;Dorne is with you, Your Grace.
403;00:24:14,534;00:24:15,991;Thank you all.
404;00:24:17,700;00:24:19,325;Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?
405;00:24:28,283;00:24:32,699;I realize you're here out of hatred
405;00:24:28,283;00:24:32,699;for Cersei and not love for me.
406;00:24:32,700;00:24:36,616;But I swear to you, she will
406;00:24:32,700;00:24:36,616;pay for what she's done.
407;00:24:36,617;00:24:39,282;And we will bring peace
407;00:24:36,617;00:24:39,282;back to Westeros.
408;00:24:39,283;00:24:41,324;Peace?
409;00:24:41,325;00:24:43,990;Do you think that's what
409;00:24:41,325;00:24:43,990;we had under your father?
410;00:24:43,991;00:24:47,116;Or his father? Or his?
411;00:24:47,117;00:24:49,782;Peace never lasts, my dear.
412;00:24:49,783;00:24:52,117;Will you take a bit of
412;00:24:49,783;00:24:52,117;advice from an old woman?
413;00:24:54,158;00:24:56,116;He's a clever man, your Hand.
414;00:24:56,117;00:24:59,949;I've known a great many clever men.
415;00:24:59,950;00:25:01,865;I've outlived them all.
416;00:25:01,866;00:25:03,782;You know why?
417;00:25:03,783;00:25:05,324;I ignored them.
418;00:25:05,325;00:25:08,824;The lords of Westeros are sheep.
419;00:25:08,825;00:25:10,225;Are you a sheep?
420;00:25:11,908;00:25:13,533;No.
421;00:25:13,534;00:25:15,824;You're a dragon.
422;00:25:15,825;00:25:17,367;Be a dragon.
423;00:25:20,950;00:25:23,699;Mají.
424;00:25:28,409;00:25:29,825;You leave tomorrow.
425;00:25:32,659;00:25:35,074;Were you going to say goodbye?
426;00:25:35,075;00:25:37,699;I will see you when I return.
427;00:25:37,700;00:25:39,575;But you don't know when that will be.
428;00:25:41,575;00:25:42,975;No one knows.
429;00:25:45,409;00:25:47,409;I wish you good fortune.
430;00:25:49,908;00:25:51,308;Missandei.
431;00:25:59,450;00:26:01,907;It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.
432;00:26:01,908;00:26:03,116;Why?
433;00:26:03,117;00:26:04,782;You know why.
434;00:26:04,783;00:26:06,183;I don't.
435;00:26:09,117;00:26:12,534;Y-you are my weakness.
436;00:26:13,866;00:26:15,990;That's what I am?
437;00:26:15,991;00:26:17,449;Your weakness?
438;00:26:17,450;00:26:21,158;When Unsullied are young, the
438;00:26:17,450;00:26:21,158;masters learn their fears.
439;00:26:22,575;00:26:25,116;One boy is scared of dogs,
440;00:26:25,117;00:26:26,990;one boy hates high places,
441;00:26:26,991;00:26:29,824;one is frightened of the ocean.
442;00:26:29,825;00:26:32,282;They make the boy sleep with dogs
443;00:26:32,283;00:26:34,199;or climb a cliff.
444;00:26:34,200;00:26:36,491;They throw him in the water.
445;00:26:36,492;00:26:38,782;If he learns to swim, good.
446;00:26:38,783;00:26:40,741;If he drowns, good.
447;00:26:41,950;00:26:44,949;Either way, strong Unsullied.
448;00:26:44,950;00:26:47,366;But I had no fears.
449;00:26:47,367;00:26:51,158;I was never the biggest,
449;00:26:47,367;00:26:51,158;never the strongest...
450;00:26:52,741;00:26:55,825;but I was bravest, always.
451;00:26:57,283;00:26:59,241;I believe it.
451;00:26:57,283;00:26:59,241;Until...
452;00:26:59,242;00:27:03,033;I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naath.
453;00:27:04,575;00:27:07,825;Now I have fear.
454;00:27:13,450;00:27:14,850;I do, too.
455;00:28:30,450;00:28:31,866;No.
456;00:28:33,409;00:28:35,075;I want to see you.
457;00:28:36,450;00:28:37,850;Please.
458;00:30:10,617;00:30:11,782;Might be useful.
459;00:30:11,783;00:30:13,658;Ch'Vyalthan was a dreadful writer,
460;00:30:13,659;00:30:15,491;but an excellent researcher.
461;00:30:15,492;00:30:17,949;Archmaester, I wondered if I...
461;00:30:15,492;00:30:17,949;And this one.
462;00:30:17,950;00:30:19,824;Maester Faull was quite the opposite...
463;00:30:19,825;00:30:22,574;a brilliant stylist who invented
463;00:30:19,825;00:30:22,574;half the stories he tells.
464;00:30:22,575;00:30:24,199;Um, I wanted to ask you...
465;00:30:24,200;00:30:25,990;If you're going to write
465;00:30:24,200;00:30:25,990;histories, Tarly,
466;00:30:25,991;00:30:27,574;you have to do the research.
467;00:30:27,575;00:30:29,449;If you want people to
467;00:30:27,575;00:30:29,449;read your histories,
468;00:30:29,450;00:30:31,699;you need a bit of style.
469;00:30:31,700;00:30:33,699;I'm not writing A Chronicle of the Wars
470;00:30:33,700;00:30:35,533;Following the Death of King Robert I
471;00:30:35,534;00:30:37,825;so it can sit on a shelf unread.
472;00:30:40,158;00:30:42,659;What? You don't like the title?
473;00:30:43,866;00:30:45,199;What would you call it, then?
474;00:30:45,200;00:30:48,533;Mm, possibly something
474;00:30:45,200;00:30:48,533;a bit more poetic?
475;00:30:48,534;00:30:51,282;We're not poets, Tarly.
476;00:30:51,283;00:30:53,449;Um, Archmaester, if I
476;00:30:51,283;00:30:53,449;could just have a moment.
477;00:30:53,450;00:30:55,199;This is your moment.
478;00:30:55,200;00:30:56,659;Use it wisely.
479;00:30:58,575;00:31:00,659;I may have found a way
479;00:30:58,575;00:31:00,659;to treat Ser Jorah.
480;00:31:02,283;00:31:04,032;There are two recorded cases
481;00:31:04,033;00:31:05,865;of advanced greyscale being cured.
482;00:31:05,866;00:31:07,699;I found the procedure in
482;00:31:05,866;00:31:07,699;the study of rare diseases
483;00:31:07,700;00:31:09,032;by Archmaester Pylos.
484;00:31:09,033;00:31:11,199;I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos
485;00:31:11,200;00:31:13,157;and his study of rare diseases.
486;00:31:13,158;00:31:15,157;Oh, you are?
486;00:31:13,158;00:31:15,157;Yes.
487;00:31:15,158;00:31:17,075;And shall I tell you how he died?
488;00:31:18,242;00:31:19,642;From greyscale.
489;00:31:21,367;00:31:23,241;Oh.
489;00:31:21,367;00:31:23,241;The procedure's far too dangerous,
490;00:31:23,242;00:31:24,642;which is why it's now forbidden.
491;00:32:08,825;00:32:10,241;Hello.
492;00:32:10,242;00:32:12,783;What are you doing?
493;00:32:14,158;00:32:16,324;You're Jorah Mormont,
494;00:32:16,325;00:32:18,283;the only son of Jeor Mormont.
495;00:32:19,617;00:32:21,408;My name is Samwell Tarly,
496;00:32:21,409;00:32:23,199;Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch,
497;00:32:23,200;00:32:25,990;training to serve as
497;00:32:23,200;00:32:25,990;maester at Castle Black.
498;00:32:25,991;00:32:27,282;I knew your father.
499;00:32:27,283;00:32:28,783;I was with him when he died.
500;00:32:34,866;00:32:36,991;You are not dying today, Ser Jorah.
501;00:32:42,991;00:32:44,616;Drink this.
502;00:32:44,617;00:32:46,408;What is it?
502;00:32:44,617;00:32:46,408;Rum.
503;00:32:46,409;00:32:48,569;Drink it all, please. I'm
503;00:32:46,409;00:32:48,569;afraid this is going to hurt.
504;00:33:08,991;00:33:11,659;If you could take off your shirt.
505;00:33:25,450;00:33:28,534;If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard.
506;00:33:30,033;00:33:31,990;I'm sorry, but no one knows I'm here,
507;00:33:31,991;00:33:34,231;and if they hear you screaming,
507;00:33:31,991;00:33:34,231;then we're both finished.
508;00:33:38,075;00:33:39,700;Have you ever done this before?
509;00:33:47,158;00:33:48,558;No.
510;00:33:49,783;00:33:52,409;But no one else will try it,
510;00:33:49,783;00:33:52,409;so I'm the best you've got.
511;00:33:55,908;00:33:57,367;Have a seat.
512;00:34:01,575;00:34:04,282;I'm going to have to remove the entire
512;00:34:01,575;00:34:04,282;upper layer of infected tissue,
513;00:34:04,283;00:34:06,575;then apply a medicinal
513;00:34:04,283;00:34:06,575;ointment to the...
514;00:34:18,908;00:34:22,408;Shh, shh!
515;00:34:22,409;00:34:24,658;Shh.
516;00:34:24,659;00:34:27,074;Again, I'm sorry,
517;00:34:27,075;00:34:29,575;but please try not to scream.
518;00:35:28,283;00:35:30,907;They say her dragons are
518;00:35:28,283;00:35:30,907;bigger than Aegon's.
519;00:35:30,908;00:35:33,658;Horseshit. Cersei's just
519;00:35:30,908;00:35:33,658;trying to frighten us.
520;00:35:33,659;00:35:35,241;I hope it's true.
521;00:35:35,242;00:35:38,282;If she lays siege to King's
521;00:35:35,242;00:35:38,282;Landing, prices will triple.
522;00:35:38,283;00:35:41,658;As long as we get back
522;00:35:38,283;00:35:41,658;there before they start.
523;00:35:41,659;00:35:44,200;One more round. It's a long ride.
524;00:35:45,325;00:35:47,658;Arry!
525;00:35:47,659;00:35:49,059;Hello, Hot Pie.
526;00:35:50,158;00:35:51,558;Sit down.
527;00:35:53,617;00:35:55,017;Who's that for?
528;00:36:03,659;00:36:05,367;Mm. This is good.
529;00:36:07,367;00:36:08,824;You think so?
530;00:36:08,825;00:36:11,574;The secret is browning the
530;00:36:08,825;00:36:11,574;butter before making the dough.
531;00:36:11,575;00:36:14,533;Most people don't do that 'cause
531;00:36:11,575;00:36:14,533;it takes up too much time.
532;00:36:14,534;00:36:16,157;Mm, I didn't do that.
533;00:36:16,158;00:36:17,699;You've been making pies?
534;00:36:17,700;00:36:20,032;One or two.
535;00:36:20,033;00:36:22,032;I can't believe you're here.
536;00:36:22,033;00:36:24,491;Did you meet the big lady?
537;00:36:24,492;00:36:27,491;Big lady?
537;00:36:24,492;00:36:27,491;The lady knight?
538;00:36:27,492;00:36:29,699;You know, I figured she was a
538;00:36:27,492;00:36:29,699;knight 'cause she had armor on.
539;00:36:29,700;00:36:33,533;She was looking for your sister,
539;00:36:29,700;00:36:33,533;but I told her about you.
540;00:36:33,534;00:36:35,033;Did she ever find you?
541;00:36:36,617;00:36:38,017;She found me.
542;00:36:43,283;00:36:44,683;What happened to you, Arry?
543;00:36:55,033;00:36:56,433;You got any ale?
544;00:37:11,409;00:37:13,574;Where you heading?
544;00:37:11,409;00:37:13,574;King's Landing.
545;00:37:13,575;00:37:16,074;Why?
545;00:37:13,575;00:37:16,074;Heard Cersei's queen now.
546;00:37:16,075;00:37:17,658;Heard she blew up the Great Sept.
547;00:37:17,659;00:37:19,241;That must have been something to see.
548;00:37:19,242;00:37:21,032;Boom.
548;00:37:19,242;00:37:21,032;Mm.
549;00:37:21,033;00:37:23,241;I can't believe someone would do that.
550;00:37:23,242;00:37:24,783;Cersei would do that.
551;00:37:26,950;00:37:29,990;I thought you'd be
551;00:37:26,950;00:37:29,990;heading for Winterfell.
552;00:37:29,991;00:37:32,116;Why would I go there?
552;00:37:29,991;00:37:32,116;The Boltons have it.
553;00:37:32,117;00:37:34,575;No, the Boltons are dead.
554;00:37:35,991;00:37:37,949;What?
555;00:37:37,950;00:37:40,116;Jon Snow came down from Castle
555;00:37:37,950;00:37:40,116;Black with a wildling army
556;00:37:40,117;00:37:41,907;and won the Battle of the Bastards.
557;00:37:41,908;00:37:43,325;He's King of the North now.
558;00:37:45,033;00:37:46,116;You're lying.
559;00:37:46,117;00:37:47,990;Why would I lie about that?
560;00:37:47,991;00:37:49,450;He's your brother, right?
561;00:37:56,367;00:37:58,782;Thanks for the pie.
562;00:37:58,783;00:38:00,699;Friends don't pay.
563;00:38:00,700;00:38:02,990;Can't believe I thought you were a boy.
564;00:38:02,991;00:38:04,908;You're pretty.
565;00:38:06,117;00:38:07,517;Thanks.
566;00:38:13,033;00:38:14,534;Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.
567;00:38:15,659;00:38:17,324;Try not to get killed.
568;00:38:17,325;00:38:18,740;Ah, I won't.
569;00:38:18,741;00:38:19,990;I'm like you, Arry.
570;00:38:19,991;00:38:21,659;I'm a survivor.
571;00:38:25,908;00:38:27,991;200 miles to King's Landing.
572;00:38:29,534;00:38:31,659;One bottle of rum. You
572;00:38:29,534;00:38:31,659;think we'll make it?
573;00:39:05,741;00:39:07,408;Come in.
574;00:39:07,409;00:39:10,866;A raven, my king, from the Citadel.
575;00:39:21,033;00:39:23,408;This message was sent
575;00:39:21,033;00:39:23,408;to me by Samwell Tarly.
576;00:39:23,409;00:39:26,740;He was my brother at the Night's Watch,
577;00:39:26,741;00:39:31,282;a man I trust as much as
577;00:39:26,741;00:39:31,282;anyone in this world.
578;00:39:31,283;00:39:34,074;He's discovered proof that Dragonstone
579;00:39:34,075;00:39:36,907;sits on a mountain of dragonglass.
580;00:39:41,075;00:39:45,241;I received this a few days ago
581;00:39:45,242;00:39:46,866;from Dragonstone.
582;00:39:48,534;00:39:50,865;It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.
583;00:39:52,908;00:39:56,241;He is now Hand of the Queen
583;00:39:52,908;00:39:56,241;to Daenerys Targaryen.
584;00:39:56,242;00:40:00,282;She intends to take the Iron
584;00:39:56,242;00:40:00,282;Throne from Cersei Lannister.
585;00:40:00,283;00:40:02,199;She has a powerful army at her back
586;00:40:02,200;00:40:06,074;and, if this message is to be believed,
587;00:40:06,075;00:40:07,366;three dragons.
588;00:40:09,367;00:40:12,116;Lord Tyrion has
588;00:40:09,367;00:40:12,116;invited me to Dragonstone
589;00:40:12,117;00:40:13,866;to meet with Daenerys.
590;00:40:15,200;00:40:16,616;And I'm going to accept.
591;00:40:16,617;00:40:18,017;Accept?!
592;00:40:20,617;00:40:24,408;We need this dragonglass, my lords!
593;00:40:24,409;00:40:26,366;We know that dragonglass can destroy
594;00:40:26,367;00:40:28,282;both white walkers and their army.
595;00:40:28,283;00:40:31,825;We need to mine it and
595;00:40:28,283;00:40:31,825;turn it into weapons.
596;00:40:33,283;00:40:35,199;But more importantly, we need allies!
597;00:40:35,200;00:40:39,491;The Night King's army
597;00:40:35,200;00:40:39,491;grows larger by the day.
598;00:40:39,492;00:40:41,241;We can't defeat them on our own.
599;00:40:41,242;00:40:43,074;We don't have the numbers.
600;00:40:43,075;00:40:46,782;Daenerys has her own army
600;00:40:43,075;00:40:46,782;and she has dragonfire.
601;00:40:46,783;00:40:50,074;I need to try and persuade
601;00:40:46,783;00:40:50,074;her to fight with us.
602;00:40:50,075;00:40:53,199;Ser Davos and I will ride
602;00:40:50,075;00:40:53,199;for White Harbor tomorrow,
603;00:40:53,200;00:40:55,616;then sail for Dragonstone.
604;00:40:55,617;00:40:58,533;Have you forgotten what
604;00:40:55,617;00:40:58,533;happened to our grandfather?
605;00:40:58,534;00:41:00,740;The Mad King invited
605;00:40:58,534;00:41:00,740;him to King's Landing
606;00:41:00,741;00:41:03,032;and roasted him alive.
606;00:41:00,741;00:41:03,032;I know that.
607;00:41:03,033;00:41:06,157;She is here to reclaim the Iron
607;00:41:03,033;00:41:06,157;Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.
608;00:41:06,158;00:41:08,157;The North is one of
608;00:41:06,158;00:41:08,157;those seven kingdoms.
609;00:41:08,158;00:41:10,990;"This isn't an invitation; it's a trap."
610;00:41:10,991;00:41:14,282;It could be, but I don't
610;00:41:10,991;00:41:14,282;believe Tyrion would do that.
611;00:41:14,283;00:41:16,658;You know him. He's a good man.
612;00:41:16,659;00:41:20,491;Your Grace, with respect, I
612;00:41:16,659;00:41:20,491;must agree with Lady Sansa.
613;00:41:20,492;00:41:23,574;I remember the Mad King all too well.
614;00:41:23,575;00:41:26,324;A Targaryen cannot be trusted.
615;00:41:26,325;00:41:28,533;Nor can a Lannister.
615;00:41:26,325;00:41:28,533;Yeah!
616;00:41:28,534;00:41:31,990;Aye. We called your brother king.
617;00:41:31,991;00:41:35,907;And then he rode south
617;00:41:31,991;00:41:35,907;and lost his kingdom.
618;00:41:35,908;00:41:39,699;Winter is here, Your Grace.
619;00:41:39,700;00:41:42,574;We need the King in the
619;00:41:39,700;00:41:42,574;North in the North.
620;00:41:42,575;00:41:45,908;Aye!
621;00:41:54,325;00:41:56,659;You all crowned me your king.
622;00:41:58,534;00:42:00,865;I never wanted it.
623;00:42:00,866;00:42:03,324;I never asked for it.
624;00:42:03,325;00:42:07,616;But I accepted it because
624;00:42:03,325;00:42:07,616;the North is my home.
625;00:42:07,617;00:42:11,907;It's part of me, and I will
625;00:42:07,617;00:42:11,907;never stop fighting for it,
626;00:42:11,908;00:42:13,325;no matter the odds.
627;00:42:16,033;00:42:17,991;But the odds are against us.
628;00:42:21,158;00:42:24,199;None of you have seen the Army
628;00:42:21,158;00:42:24,199;of the Dead. None of you.
629;00:42:24,200;00:42:28,241;We can never hope to defeat them alone.
630;00:42:28,242;00:42:31,242;We need allies, powerful allies.
631;00:42:34,075;00:42:36,075;I know it's a risk.
632;00:42:37,866;00:42:39,282;But I have to take it.
633;00:42:39,283;00:42:42,032;Then send an emissary.
633;00:42:39,283;00:42:42,032;Don't go yourself.
634;00:42:42,033;00:42:43,574;Daenerys is a queen.
635;00:42:43,575;00:42:45,907;Only a king can convince her to help us.
636;00:42:45,908;00:42:47,699;It has to be me.
637;00:42:47,700;00:42:49,658;You're abandoning your people!
638;00:42:49,659;00:42:51,449;You're abandoning your home.
639;00:42:51,450;00:42:53,366;I'm leaving both in good hands.
640;00:42:53,367;00:42:54,783;Whose?
640;00:42:53,367;00:42:54,783;Yours.
641;00:42:56,825;00:42:58,282;You are my sister.
642;00:42:58,283;00:43:00,366;You're the only Stark in Winterfell.
643;00:43:00,367;00:43:04,283;Until I return, the North is yours.
644;00:43:27,492;00:43:29,409;I delivered his bones myself.
645;00:43:30,950;00:43:32,574;Presented them to Lady Catelyn
646;00:43:32,575;00:43:35,075;as a gesture of goodwill
646;00:43:32,575;00:43:35,075;from Tyrion Lannister.
647;00:43:36,409;00:43:37,908;Seems like a lifetime ago.
648;00:43:39,617;00:43:42,242;Do give Lord Tyrion my
648;00:43:39,617;00:43:42,242;best when you see him.
649;00:43:45,659;00:43:47,616;I was sorry when he died.
650;00:43:47,617;00:43:51,325;Your father and I had our differences,
650;00:43:47,617;00:43:51,325;but he loved Cat very much.
651;00:43:53,991;00:43:55,534;So did I.
652;00:43:57,825;00:43:59,991;She wasn't fond of you, was she?
653;00:44:01,908;00:44:04,950;Well, it appears she
653;00:44:01,908;00:44:04,950;vastly underestimated you.
654;00:44:07,075;00:44:08,408;Your father and brothers are gone,
655;00:44:08,409;00:44:10,450;yet here you stand, King in the North.
656;00:44:11,825;00:44:14,158;Last best hope against the coming storm.
657;00:44:19,283;00:44:21,325;You don't belong down here.
658;00:44:22,700;00:44:24,117;Forgive me.
659;00:44:25,908;00:44:29,366;We haven't ever talked... properly.
660;00:44:29,367;00:44:30,866;I wanted to remedy that.
661;00:44:32,200;00:44:34,033;I have nothing to say to you.
662;00:44:35,783;00:44:38,116;Not even thank you?
663;00:44:38,117;00:44:42,366;If it weren't for me, you'd have been
663;00:44:38,117;00:44:42,366;slaughtered on that battlefield.
664;00:44:42,367;00:44:45,741;You have many enemies, my king, but I
664;00:44:42,367;00:44:45,741;swear to you, I'm not one of them.
665;00:44:48,325;00:44:50,408;I love Sansa,
666;00:44:50,409;00:44:52,074;as I loved her mother.
667;00:45:02,367;00:45:05,908;Touch my sister, and
667;00:45:02,367;00:45:05,908;I'll kill you myself.
668;00:45:31,783;00:45:33,534;Ready?
668;00:45:31,783;00:45:33,534;Ready?
669;00:45:37,200;00:45:38,600;Ready!
670;00:45:42,075;00:45:43,475;Come on.
671;00:45:46,700;00:45:48,950;Yah!
671;00:45:46,700;00:45:48,950;Come on!
672;00:47:38,242;00:47:39,865;Nymeria?
673;00:47:54,242;00:47:57,575;Nymeria, it's me, Arya.
674;00:48:02,659;00:48:04,908;I'm heading north, girl.
675;00:48:07,409;00:48:09,950;Back to Winterfell. I'm
675;00:48:07,409;00:48:09,950;finally going home.
676;00:48:13,492;00:48:14,892;Come with me.
677;00:48:24,950;00:48:26,367;Come with me.
678;00:48:54,492;00:48:56,117;That's not you.
679;00:49:11,991;00:49:14,949;You can't have them all.
679;00:49:11,991;00:49:14,949;It's not fair.
680;00:49:14,950;00:49:16,366;I'm oldest.
681;00:49:16,367;00:49:18,491;Mama will want Cersei for herself.
682;00:49:18,492;00:49:20,491;She's not my mama.
683;00:49:20,492;00:49:22,574;You can have Cersei.
684;00:49:22,575;00:49:25,116;I want the Mountain.
685;00:49:25,117;00:49:27,241;The Mountain killed Father.
686;00:49:27,242;00:49:28,990;He'll crush you with one hand.
687;00:49:28,991;00:49:31,740;Father got careless.
687;00:49:28,991;00:49:31,740;That's what Mama says.
688;00:49:31,741;00:49:33,949;Will you shut up about Mama?
689;00:49:33,950;00:49:35,533;Mama, Mama, Mama.
690;00:49:35,534;00:49:39,408;Maybe I'll kill you both
690;00:49:35,534;00:49:39,408;before we take King's Landing.
691;00:49:39,409;00:49:40,950;And then I won't have to share.
692;00:49:43,450;00:49:44,850;Mama!
693;00:49:46,700;00:49:48,658;How can you drink this piss?
694;00:49:48,659;00:49:50,782;When we reach Sunspear,
695;00:49:50,783;00:49:53,324;I'll treat you to a Dornish red.
696;00:49:53,325;00:49:55,740;The best in the world.
697;00:49:55,741;00:49:57,157;Have you ever been to Dorne?
698;00:49:57,158;00:49:59,157;A few times.
699;00:49:59,158;00:50:00,533;Never stayed long.
700;00:50:00,534;00:50:02,075;A boy in every port?
701;00:50:03,200;00:50:04,659;A boy, a girl.
702;00:50:06,200;00:50:07,600;Depends on the port.
703;00:50:11,242;00:50:13,409;Could we get some more?
704;00:50:14,700;00:50:16,574;I thought it wasn't for you.
705;00:50:16,575;00:50:18,866;I'm developing a taste for it.
706;00:50:20,409;00:50:22,659;He's not your servant.
706;00:50:20,409;00:50:22,659;It's fine.
707;00:50:24,617;00:50:29,366;So, you're going to be
707;00:50:24,617;00:50:29,366;Queen of the Iron Islands.
708;00:50:29,367;00:50:31,199;Once I kill my uncle.
709;00:50:31,200;00:50:33,658;And what will you be, handsome?
710;00:50:33,659;00:50:35,366;Whatever my queen commands.
711;00:50:35,367;00:50:39,199;He'll be my advisor, my protector.
712;00:50:39,200;00:50:41,449;Oh, I see.
713;00:50:41,450;00:50:42,866;Your protector.
714;00:50:44,617;00:50:47,157;So, if someone gets too close to you...
715;00:50:47,158;00:50:48,949;He might have to intervene.
716;00:50:48,950;00:50:50,740;To hold that person back.
717;00:50:50,741;00:50:53,409;Until they've made their
717;00:50:50,741;00:50:53,409;intentions known.
718;00:50:56,783;00:50:58,743;Why are you standing all
718;00:50:56,783;00:50:58,743;the way over there, then?
719;00:51:00,242;00:51:02,324;A foreign invasion is underway.
720;00:51:02,325;00:51:04,075;Leave him be.
721;00:51:07,325;00:51:09,450;Seems like you don't need a protector.
722;00:51:15,242;00:51:16,642;Stay here.
723;00:51:19,367;00:51:22,325;We're under attack!
724;00:51:44,617;00:51:46,075;Euron.
725;00:52:53,991;00:52:56,325;You mother's below deck. Keep her safe.
726;00:53:48,242;00:53:49,907;Aah!
727;00:54:03,741;00:54:05,141;Yah!
728;00:54:10,492;00:54:11,892;Aah!
729;00:54:29,659;00:54:31,059;Yah!
730;00:54:32,450;00:54:33,850;Yah!
731;00:54:51,991;00:54:53,491;Kill us.
732;00:54:53,492;00:54:54,950;Get it over with.
733;00:55:19,700;00:55:21,158;Give your uncle a kiss.
734;00:55:57,950;00:55:59,908;Little Theon!
735;00:56:13,991;00:56:16,908;Ah, come on, you cockless coward.
736;00:56:20,575;00:56:22,658;I have her.
737;00:56:22,659;00:56:24,242;Come and get her.
