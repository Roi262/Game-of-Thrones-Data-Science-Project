506;00:33:01,230;00:33:03,831;come to me before dawn,
507;00:33:03,865;00:33:06,767;and I will grant you
507;00:33:03,865;00:33:06,767;your old seat in the council.
508;00:33:07,936;00:33:10,737;I'll even name you
508;00:33:07,936;00:33:10,737;my heir
509;00:33:10,772;00:33:12,606;until a son
509;00:33:10,772;00:33:12,606;is born to me.
510;00:33:14,676;00:33:16,944;Otherwise I shall
510;00:33:14,676;00:33:16,944;destroy you.
511;00:33:20,682;00:33:22,383;Look across
511;00:33:20,682;00:33:22,383;those fields, brother.
512;00:33:22,417;00:33:25,053;Can you see
512;00:33:22,417;00:33:25,053;all those banners?
513;00:33:25,087;00:33:27,823;You think a few bolts
513;00:33:25,087;00:33:27,823;of cloth will make you King?
514;00:33:27,857;00:33:30,025;No.
515;00:33:30,060;00:33:33,196;The men holding those bolts
515;00:33:30,060;00:33:33,196;of cloth will make me King.
516;00:33:33,230;00:33:35,098;We shall see, Renly.
517;00:33:35,132;00:33:37,868;Come the dawn,
517;00:33:35,132;00:33:37,868;we shall see.
518;00:33:37,902;00:33:40,070;Look to your sins,
518;00:33:37,902;00:33:40,070;Lord Renly.
519;00:33:40,105;00:33:42,606;The night is dark
519;00:33:40,105;00:33:42,606;and full of terrors.
520;00:33:48,146;00:33:51,714;Would you believe
520;00:33:48,146;00:33:51,714;I loved him once?
521;00:34:12,103;00:34:14,104;I thought we were welcome.
522;00:34:14,138;00:34:17,007;If you heard a Dothraki horde
522;00:34:14,138;00:34:17,007;was approaching your city,
523;00:34:17,041;00:34:19,075;you might do the same,
523;00:34:17,041;00:34:19,075;Khaleesi.
524;00:34:21,445;00:34:23,479;Horde?
525;00:34:38,195;00:34:40,229;My name is Daenerys--
526;00:34:40,264;00:34:43,499;Daenerys Stormborn
526;00:34:40,264;00:34:43,499;of the House Targaryen.
527;00:34:43,534;00:34:45,568;You know me, My Lord?
528;00:34:45,602;00:34:48,238;Only by reputation,
528;00:34:45,602;00:34:48,238;Khaleesi.
529;00:34:48,272;00:34:51,808;And I'm no lord,
529;00:34:48,272;00:34:51,808;merely a humble merchant.
530;00:34:52,911;00:34:55,546;They call you
530;00:34:52,911;00:34:55,546;the Mother of Dragons.
531;00:34:55,580;00:34:57,548;And what should
531;00:34:55,580;00:34:57,548;I call you?
532;00:34:57,582;00:34:59,150;Oh, my name is quite long
533;00:34:59,184;00:35:01,753;and quite impossible
533;00:34:59,184;00:35:01,753;for foreigners to pronounce.
534;00:35:01,787;00:35:05,391;I am simply a trader
534;00:35:01,787;00:35:05,391;of spices.
535;00:35:05,425;00:35:08,761;But we are the Thirteen,
536;00:35:08,796;00:35:12,132;charged with the governance
536;00:35:08,796;00:35:12,132;and protection of Qarth,
537;00:35:12,166;00:35:15,869;the greatest city
537;00:35:12,166;00:35:15,869;that ever was or will be.
538;00:35:17,171;00:35:19,704;The beauty of
538;00:35:17,171;00:35:19,704;Quarth is legendary--
539;00:35:19,729;00:35:21,729;Qarth.
540;00:35:23,211;00:35:24,811;Qarth.
541;00:35:24,846;00:35:27,881;Might we see
541;00:35:24,846;00:35:27,881;the dragons?
542;00:35:32,487;00:35:35,889;My friend,
543;00:35:35,924;00:35:38,358;we have travelled
543;00:35:35,924;00:35:38,358;very far.
544;00:35:38,392;00:35:40,893;We have no food,
544;00:35:38,392;00:35:40,893;no water.
545;00:35:40,928;00:35:43,395;Once I see my people fed,
545;00:35:40,928;00:35:43,395;I would be honored--
546;00:35:43,430;00:35:46,265;Forgive me,

547;00:35:46,299;00:35:50,302;but no man alive has seen
547;00:35:46,299;00:35:50,302;a living dragon.
548;00:35:50,336;00:35:52,504;Some of my more
548;00:35:50,336;00:35:52,504;skeptical friends
549;00:35:52,538;00:35:55,974;refuse to believe
549;00:35:52,538;00:35:55,974;your children
550;00:35:56,008;00:35:57,909;even exist.
551;00:35:57,944;00:36:01,346;All we ask is the chance
551;00:35:57,944;00:36:01,346;to see for ourselves.
552;00:36:01,380;00:36:03,348;I am not a liar.
553;00:36:03,383;00:36:05,417;Oh, I don't think you are.
554;00:36:05,451;00:36:07,152;But as I've never
554;00:36:05,451;00:36:07,152;met you before,
555;00:36:07,186;00:36:10,389;my opinion on the matter
555;00:36:07,186;00:36:10,389;is of limited value.
556;00:36:11,925;00:36:14,360;Where I come from,
557;00:36:14,394;00:36:16,862;guests are treated
557;00:36:14,394;00:36:16,862;with respect,
558;00:36:16,897;00:36:20,199;not insulted
558;00:36:16,897;00:36:20,199;at the gates.
559;00:36:20,233;00:36:22,734;Then perhaps you should
559;00:36:20,233;00:36:22,734;return to where you come from.
560;00:36:22,769;00:36:24,970;We wish you well.
561;00:36:28,475;00:36:30,376;What are you doing?
562;00:36:30,410;00:36:33,211;You promised
562;00:36:30,410;00:36:33,211;to receive me.
563;00:36:34,313;00:36:35,714;We have received you.
564;00:36:35,748;00:36:38,450;Here we are,
564;00:36:35,748;00:36:38,450;and here you are.
565;00:36:38,484;00:36:42,388;If you do not let us in,
565;00:36:38,484;00:36:42,388;all of us will die.
566;00:36:42,422;00:36:45,124;Which we shall
566;00:36:42,422;00:36:45,124;deeply regret.
567;00:36:45,158;00:36:46,229;But Qarth did not become
568;00:36:46,254;00:36:48,374;the greatest city that
568;00:36:46,254;00:36:48,374;ever was or will be
569;00:36:48,395;00:36:52,065;by letting Dothraki savages
569;00:36:48,395;00:36:52,065;through its gates.
570;00:36:58,939;00:37:01,174;Khaleesi, please
570;00:36:58,939;00:37:01,174;be careful.
571;00:37:04,011;00:37:06,613;Thirteen!
572;00:37:06,647;00:37:09,149;When my dragons are grown,
573;00:37:09,183;00:37:12,285;we will take back
573;00:37:09,183;00:37:12,285;what was stolen from me
574;00:37:12,320;00:37:14,654;and destroy those
574;00:37:12,320;00:37:14,654;who have wronged me.
575;00:37:14,689;00:37:17,157;We will lay waste
575;00:37:14,689;00:37:17,157;to armies
576;00:37:17,191;00:37:19,892;and burn cities
576;00:37:17,191;00:37:19,892;to the ground.
577;00:37:19,927;00:37:23,896;Turn us away and we will
577;00:37:19,927;00:37:23,896;burn you first.
578;00:37:23,931;00:37:26,098;Ah.
579;00:37:26,133;00:37:28,901;You are a true

580;00:37:28,936;00:37:32,071;Only, as you said
580;00:37:28,936;00:37:32,071;a moment ago,
583;00:37:31,276;00:37:33,911;Retreating in fear
583;00:37:31,276;00:37:33,911;from a little girl
584;00:37:33,945;00:37:36,113;is unbecoming
584;00:37:33,945;00:37:36,113;of the greatest city
585;00:37:36,147;00:37:37,715;that ever was
585;00:37:36,147;00:37:37,715;or will be.
586;00:37:37,749;00:37:41,286;The discussion is over,
586;00:37:37,749;00:37:41,286;Xaro Xhoan Daxos.
587;00:37:41,320;00:37:43,321;The Thirteen have spoken.

589;00:37:46,125;00:37:48,560;and I am still speaking.
590;00:37:48,594;00:37:50,929;The girl threatens to burn
590;00:37:48,594;00:37:50,929;our city to the ground
591;00:37:50,963;00:37:54,132;and you would invite her in
591;00:37:50,963;00:37:54,132;for a cup of wine?
592;00:37:54,166;00:37:56,234;She is the Mother

593;00:37:56,268;00:37:59,570;Do you expect her to watch
593;00:37:56,268;00:37:59,570;her people starve
594;00:37:59,604;00:38:01,705;without breathing fire?
595;00:38:01,740;00:38:04,308;I believe we can allow
595;00:38:01,740;00:38:04,308;a few Dothraki
596;00:38:04,342;00:38:06,910;through our gates
596;00:38:04,342;00:38:06,910;without dooming our city.
597;00:38:06,945;00:38:10,248;After all, here I am,

599;00:38:12,384;00:38:14,253;and Qarth still stands.
600;00:38:14,320;00:38:17,189;Our decision is final.
601;00:38:17,224;00:38:19,359;Very well.
602;00:38:21,629;00:38:24,231;I invoke Soumai.
603;00:38:28,069;00:38:30,736;I will vouch for her,

615;00:40:30,123;00:40:32,791;We weren't expecting you

751;00:47:00,918;00:47:02,652;What am I bringing
751;00:47:00,918;00:47:02,652;ashore?
752;00:47:02,687;00:47:04,521;The red woman.
753;00:47:06,224;00:47:08,392;No one must know
753;00:47:06,224;00:47:08,392;what you do
754;00:47:08,426;00:47:10,027;and we'll not speak
754;00:47:08,426;00:47:10,027;of this again.
755;00:47:10,062;00:47:13,597;I am true to Your Grace
755;00:47:10,062;00:47:13,597;and always will be,
756;00:47:13,632;00:47:16,600;but surely there are
756;00:47:13,632;00:47:16,600;other ways, cleaner ways.
757;00:47:16,635;00:47:19,069;Cleaner ways
757;00:47:16,635;00:47:19,069;don't win wars.
758;00:47:48,803;00:47:51,771;Are you afraid,
758;00:47:48,803;00:47:51,771;onion knight?
759;00:47:54,008;00:47:55,257;Someone once told me
760;00:47:55,282;00:47:57,680;the night is dark and
760;00:47:55,282;00:47:57,680;full of terrors.
761;00:47:59,379;00:48:02,081;You've carried more
761;00:47:59,379;00:48:02,081;unpleasant cargo in your time.
762;00:48:05,985;00:48:08,921;Are you a good man,
762;00:48:05,985;00:48:08,921;Ser Davos Seaworth?
763;00:48:08,955;00:48:10,915;I'd say my parts
763;00:48:08,955;00:48:10,915;are mixed, My Lady--
764;00:48:11,740;00:48:12,825;good and bad.
765;00:48:12,826;00:48:15,328;If half an onion
765;00:48:12,826;00:48:15,328;is black with rot,
766;00:48:15,362;00:48:17,263;it's a rotten onion.
767;00:48:17,298;00:48:20,000;A man is good
767;00:48:17,298;00:48:20,000;or he is evil.
768;00:48:20,034;00:48:21,901;And which are you?
768;00:48:20,034;00:48:21,901;Oh, good.
769;00:48:21,936;00:48:25,238;I'm a knight myself
769;00:48:21,936;00:48:25,238;of sorts,
770;00:48:25,273;00:48:28,108;a champion of light
770;00:48:25,273;00:48:28,108;and life.
771;00:48:28,142;00:48:31,311;Well, that must be
771;00:48:28,142;00:48:31,311;very nice for you.
772;00:48:47,565;00:48:51,701;Do you love your wife?
772;00:48:47,565;00:48:51,701;I do.
773;00:48:51,736;00:48:54,037;Yet you have known
773;00:48:51,736;00:48:54,037;other women.
774;00:48:54,071;00:48:55,905;Don't talk about my wife.
775;00:48:55,939;00:48:59,909;I'm not. I'm talking about
775;00:48:55,939;00:48:59,909;other women.
776;00:48:59,943;00:49:02,311;Like me, Ser Davos.
777;00:49:06,583;00:49:08,484;You want me.
778;00:49:08,519;00:49:11,487;You want to see
778;00:49:08,519;00:49:11,487;what's beneath this robe.
779;00:49:13,090;00:49:15,291;And you will.
780;00:49:19,831;00:49:22,867;Strange that
780;00:49:19,831;00:49:22,867;this Lord of Light
781;00:49:22,901;00:49:25,770;asks you to work
781;00:49:22,901;00:49:25,770;in the shadows.
782;00:49:25,804;00:49:29,073;Shadows cannot live
782;00:49:25,804;00:49:29,073;in the dark, Ser Davos.
783;00:49:29,108;00:49:31,609;They are servants
783;00:49:29,108;00:49:31,609;of light,

785;00:49:34,112;00:49:37,548;And the brighter the flame,
785;00:49:34,112;00:49:37,548;the darker they are.
786;00:49:37,582;00:49:40,417;These weren't here before.
786;00:49:37,582;00:49:40,417;They've barred the passage.
