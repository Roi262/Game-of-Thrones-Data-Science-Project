257;00:21:15,494;00:21:18,119;I haven't had the heart
257;00:21:15,494;00:21:18,119;to tell him yet.
258;00:21:18,120;00:21:20,162;He's a good lad.
259;00:21:20,163;00:21:21,911;Right.
260;00:21:21,912;00:21:24,827;The ravenry was falling apart
260;00:21:21,912;00:21:24,827;the last time I checked.

262;00:21:30,038;00:21:32,661;that people bend the knee.

263;00:21:32,662;00:21:33,871;they're rulers.
264;00:21:36,996;00:21:38,995;She gave Tarly
264;00:21:36,996;00:21:38,995;a choice,
265;00:21:38,996;00:21:41,828;a man who had taken up
265;00:21:38,996;00:21:41,828;arms against her.

266;00:21:41,829;00:21:43,578;could she do?
267;00:21:43,579;00:21:46,703;Not burn him alive
267;00:21:43,579;00:21:46,703;alongside his son?
268;00:21:46,704;00:21:49,037;I am her Hand, not her head.

277;00:22:17,997;00:22:19,578;caught fire
278;00:22:19,579;00:22:22,453;and the smell of their burning
278;00:22:19,579;00:22:22,453;flesh filled the throne room...
279;00:22:22,454;00:22:24,080;I'm not the one

283;00:22:37,371;00:22:39,412;with the right counsel.
284;00:22:42,662;00:22:45,079;You need to find a way
284;00:22:42,662;00:22:45,079;to make her listen.
285;00:22:47,538;00:22:50,913;Who's that for?
285;00:22:47,538;00:22:50,913;Jon Snow.

287;00:22:52,454;00:22:55,495;It's a sealed scroll
287;00:22:52,454;00:22:55,495;for the King in the North.

289;00:23:04,164;00:23:05,747;Nothing good.
290;00:23:12,246;00:23:15,621;I thought
290;00:23:12,246;00:23:15,621;Arya was dead.
291;00:23:15,622;00:23:18,704;I thought Bran

297;00:23:31,872;00:23:34,579;The Wall has kept them out for
297;00:23:31,872;00:23:34,579;thousands of years, presumably.

300;00:23:37,956;00:23:40,537;We'll fight
300;00:23:37,956;00:23:40,537;with the men we have.

302;00:23:42,164;00:23:44,329;And give the country

306;00:23:53,914;00:23:57,163;to frighten children.
307;00:23:57,164;00:23:58,913;What if we
307;00:23:57,164;00:23:58,913;prove her wrong?
308;00:23:58,914;00:24:02,330;I don't think she'll come see

310;00:24:07,123;00:24:08,996;I thought that was what
310;00:24:07,123;00:24:08,996;we were trying to avoid.

318;00:24:28,330;00:24:30,371;will be useless
319;00:24:30,372;00:24:32,204;unless Cersei
319;00:24:30,372;00:24:32,204;grants us an audience
320;00:24:32,205;00:24:34,746;and is somehow convinced
320;00:24:32,205;00:24:34,746;not to murder us
321;00:24:34,747;00:24:36,997;the moment we set foot
321;00:24:34,747;00:24:36,997;in the capital.

323;00:24:40,581;00:24:42,413;He might listen to me.
324;00:24:46,414;00:24:48,246;And how would you get
324;00:24:46,414;00:24:48,246;into King's Landing?
325;00:24:54,414;00:24:56,246;I can smuggle you in,
326;00:24:56,247;00:24:58,872;but if the gold cloaks

329;00:25:03,497;00:25:05,288;if we don't have
329;00:25:03,497;00:25:05,288;one of these dead men.
330;00:25:05,289;00:25:06,663;Fair point.
331;00:25:06,664;00:25:07,956;How do you propose
331;00:25:06,664;00:25:07,956;to find one?
332;00:25:11,371;00:25:14,581;With the queen's permission,
332;00:25:11,371;00:25:14,581;I'll go north and take one.

336;00:25:26,748;00:25:29,496;better than anyone.

378;00:28:18,248;00:28:19,624;and you sat there
378;00:28:18,248;00:28:19,624;and listened.
379;00:28:19,625;00:28:21,124;I listened
379;00:28:19,625;00:28:21,124;to their complaints,
380;00:28:21,125;00:28:24,166;which is my responsibility
380;00:28:21,125;00:28:24,166;as Lady of Winterfell.
381;00:28:24,167;00:28:27,124;Their opinions
381;00:28:24,167;00:28:27,124;are important to you.
382;00:28:27,125;00:28:29,832;Glover has 500 men,
382;00:28:27,125;00:28:29,832;Royce has 2,000.
383;00:28:29,833;00:28:32,790;Offend them
383;00:28:29,833;00:28:32,790;and Jon loses his army.
384;00:28:32,791;00:28:34,791;Not if they lose
384;00:28:32,791;00:28:34,791;their heads first.
385;00:28:38,249;00:28:41,415;Winterfell didn't just
385;00:28:38,249;00:28:41,415;fall into our hands.
386;00:28:41,416;00:28:43,290;We took it back,
387;00:28:43,291;00:28:45,248;and the Mormonts
387;00:28:43,291;00:28:45,248;and the Hornwoods
388;00:28:45,249;00:28:46,707;and the wildlings
388;00:28:45,249;00:28:46,707;and the Vale.
389;00:28:46,708;00:28:48,248;All of us,
389;00:28:46,708;00:28:48,248;working together.
390;00:28:48,249;00:28:52,582;Now, I'm sure cutting off
390;00:28:48,249;00:28:52,582;heads is very satisfying,
391;00:28:52,583;00:28:56,125;but that's not the way you
391;00:28:52,583;00:28:56,125;get people to work together.
392;00:28:59,291;00:29:01,582;And if Jon
392;00:28:59,291;00:29:01,582;doesn't come back,
393;00:29:01,583;00:29:03,540;you'll need
393;00:29:01,583;00:29:03,540;their support...
394;00:29:03,541;00:29:05,665;so you can
394;00:29:03,541;00:29:05,665;work together
395;00:29:05,666;00:29:07,625;to give you
395;00:29:05,666;00:29:07,625;what you really want.
396;00:29:07,626;00:29:10,209;How can you even think
396;00:29:07,626;00:29:10,209;such a horrible thing?
397;00:29:12,917;00:29:14,958;You're thinking it
397;00:29:12,917;00:29:14,958;right now.
398;00:29:16,959;00:29:19,917;You don't want to be,
399;00:29:19,918;00:29:22,208;but the thought
399;00:29:19,918;00:29:22,208;just won't go away.
400;00:29:28,125;00:29:30,001;I have work to do.
401;00:29:33,667;00:29:34,958;My lady.
402;00:29:39,500;00:29:41,333;( door opens, closes )
403;00:29:47,001;00:29:50,249;Last time I was here, I killed
403;00:29:47,001;00:29:50,249;my father with a crossbow.
404;00:29:50,250;00:29:53,209;Last time I was here, you
404;00:29:50,250;00:29:53,209;killed my son with wildfire.
405;00:29:56,375;00:29:59,208;There's a path to the left
405;00:29:56,375;00:29:59,208;that hugs the cliff.
406;00:29:59,209;00:30:01,875;The guards
406;00:29:59,209;00:30:01,875;hardly ever patrol it.
407;00:30:01,876;00:30:03,250;Too many steps.
408;00:30:08,125;00:30:09,416;You're not
408;00:30:08,125;00:30:09,416;staying here?
409;00:30:09,417;00:30:12,917;I've got my own business
409;00:30:09,417;00:30:12,917;in Flea Bottom.
410;00:30:12,918;00:30:14,750;What if someone
410;00:30:12,918;00:30:14,750;takes the boat?
411;00:30:14,751;00:30:17,043;Then we're fucked.
411;00:30:14,751;00:30:17,043;Best hurry.
412;00:30:22,459;00:30:23,875;We don't have time
412;00:30:22,459;00:30:23,875;for this.
413;00:30:23,876;00:30:26,042;We should be preparing
413;00:30:23,876;00:30:26,042;the city for a siege.
414;00:30:26,043;00:30:27,208;The Dothraki
414;00:30:26,043;00:30:27,208;are coming.
415;00:30:27,209;00:30:29,333;All the more reason
415;00:30:27,209;00:30:29,333;for you to train.
416;00:30:29,334;00:30:31,333;Unless you plan on fighting
416;00:30:29,334;00:30:31,333;Dothraki 12-year-olds.
417;00:30:31,334;00:30:33,875;Well, I seem to recall them giving
417;00:30:31,334;00:30:33,875;you a bit of trouble as well.
418;00:30:33,876;00:30:35,875;And here I am,
418;00:30:33,876;00:30:35,875;ready to train.
419;00:30:35,876;00:30:37,834;Why down here?
420;00:30:37,835;00:30:39,666;I don't think
420;00:30:37,835;00:30:39,666;you want people to see
421;00:30:39,667;00:30:42,583;how you look swinging
421;00:30:39,667;00:30:42,583;that thing yet.
422;00:30:42,584;00:30:45,374;Today might be the day
422;00:30:42,584;00:30:45,374;I kill you by accident.
423;00:30:45,375;00:30:47,919;Oh, you won't be
423;00:30:45,375;00:30:47,919;swinging it at me.
424;00:30:56,126;00:30:57,793;I'll leave you
424;00:30:56,126;00:30:57,793;to it.
425;00:31:01,584;00:31:02,918;I needed to see you.
426;00:31:04,376;00:31:06,209;And I knew you'd
426;00:31:04,376;00:31:06,209;never agree to meet.
427;00:31:09,752;00:31:12,708;You made me look
427;00:31:09,752;00:31:12,708;like a complete fool.
428;00:31:12,709;00:31:15,000;I thought I'd surprise you
428;00:31:12,709;00:31:15,000;by hitting Casterly Rock,
429;00:31:15,001;00:31:17,958;but you were
429;00:31:15,001;00:31:17,958;three steps ahead of me.
430;00:31:17,959;00:31:20,542;Abandoned the family home,
430;00:31:17,959;00:31:20,542;completely unsentimental.
431;00:31:20,543;00:31:22,042;Father would have
431;00:31:20,543;00:31:22,042;been proud.
432;00:31:22,043;00:31:23,792;Don't talk about Father.
432;00:31:22,043;00:31:23,792;Listen to me...
433;00:31:23,793;00:31:25,291;I once told Bronn
434;00:31:25,292;00:31:28,126;that if I ever saw you
434;00:31:25,292;00:31:28,126;again, I'd cut you in half.
435;00:31:31,127;00:31:33,627;It'll take you a while
435;00:31:31,127;00:31:33,627;with a sparring sword.
436;00:31:42,793;00:31:44,708;He was going to execute me.
437;00:31:44,709;00:31:47,417;He knew
437;00:31:44,709;00:31:47,417;I was innocent.
438;00:31:47,418;00:31:49,751;He didn't hate me
438;00:31:47,418;00:31:49,751;because of anything I did,
439;00:31:49,752;00:31:52,126;he hated me
439;00:31:49,752;00:31:52,126;because of what I am.
440;00:31:52,127;00:31:55,293;A little monster
440;00:31:52,127;00:31:55,293;sent to punish him.
441;00:31:57,169;00:31:59,375;Did he...
441;00:31:57,169;00:31:59,375;did he think...
442;00:31:59,376;00:32:01,169;did he think I wanted
442;00:31:59,376;00:32:01,169;to be born this way?
443;00:32:01,170;00:32:03,089;Did he think I chose it...
443;00:32:01,170;00:32:03,089;What do you want?!
444;00:32:09,585;00:32:11,128;Daenerys will
444;00:32:09,585;00:32:11,128;win this war.
445;00:32:13,501;00:32:14,918;You're
445;00:32:13,501;00:32:14,918;a military man.
446;00:32:14,919;00:32:17,669;You must know there's
446;00:32:14,919;00:32:17,669;no way around that.
447;00:32:19,710;00:32:21,292;Daenerys
447;00:32:19,710;00:32:21,292;is not her father.
448;00:32:21,293;00:32:24,169;She's even willing
448;00:32:21,293;00:32:24,169;to suspend the hostilities
449;00:32:24,170;00:32:26,668;if Cersei agrees
449;00:32:24,170;00:32:26,668;to certain terms.
450;00:32:27,836;00:32:29,209;If you want Cersei
450;00:32:27,836;00:32:29,209;to bend the knee,
451;00:32:29,210;00:32:30,668;you can ask her
451;00:32:29,210;00:32:30,668;yourself.
452;00:32:30,669;00:32:33,044;I... I don't.
452;00:32:30,669;00:32:33,044;And Daenerys doesn't.
453;00:32:34,461;00:32:36,169;Not right now,
453;00:32:34,461;00:32:36,169;anyway.
454;00:32:38,335;00:32:40,586;She has a more
454;00:32:38,335;00:32:40,586;important request.
455;00:32:44,045;00:32:46,210;( chatter )
456;00:33:20,086;00:33:22,294;I wasn't sure
456;00:33:20,086;00:33:22,294;I'd find you.
457;00:33:29,586;00:33:31,585;Thought you might
457;00:33:29,586;00:33:31,585;still be rowing.
458;00:33:31,586;00:33:33,753;( chuckles )
459;00:33:35,211;00:33:38,293;I looked in shops,
459;00:33:35,211;00:33:38,293;taverns, brothels.
460;00:33:38,294;00:33:41,585;Should have known to come
460;00:33:38,294;00:33:41,585;straight to the Street of Steel.
461;00:33:41,586;00:33:44,085;Aren't you worried
461;00:33:41,586;00:33:44,085;about the gold cloaks?
462;00:33:44,086;00:33:45,501;Haven't been here
462;00:33:44,086;00:33:45,501;in years.
463;00:33:45,502;00:33:47,920;Why should
463;00:33:45,502;00:33:47,920;they recognize me?
464;00:33:47,921;00:33:50,586;Sometimes I hardly do.
465;00:33:52,252;00:33:54,420;Nothing fucks you
465;00:33:52,252;00:33:54,420;harder than time.
466;00:33:59,211;00:34:01,293;Anybody give you
466;00:33:59,211;00:34:01,293;any trouble?
467;00:34:01,294;00:34:03,753;Here I am,
467;00:34:01,294;00:34:03,753;arming Lannisters,
468;00:34:03,754;00:34:05,627;and I never get
468;00:34:03,754;00:34:05,627;a second look.
469;00:34:05,628;00:34:07,128;But you were right.
470;00:34:07,129;00:34:09,668;Safest place for me was
470;00:34:07,129;00:34:09,668;right under the queen's nose.
471;00:34:09,669;00:34:11,170;Don't be so sure.
472;00:34:11,171;00:34:14,087;Safety is never a permanent
472;00:34:11,171;00:34:14,087;state of affairs.
473;00:34:16,294;00:34:17,837;Bad things are coming.
474;00:34:20,337;00:34:23,294;You came to get me.
474;00:34:20,337;00:34:23,294;You want me to come with you.
475;00:34:23,295;00:34:25,418;Well, the thing you need to understand is...
475;00:34:23,295;00:34:25,418;I'm ready.
476;00:34:25,419;00:34:26,878;You...
476;00:34:25,419;00:34:26,878;Let's go.
477;00:34:26,879;00:34:28,793;You should know
477;00:34:26,879;00:34:28,793;what you're heading into.
478;00:34:28,794;00:34:30,794;What do you think
478;00:34:28,794;00:34:30,794;I've been thinking about
479;00:34:30,795;00:34:32,169;with every swing
479;00:34:30,795;00:34:32,169;of the hammer?
480;00:34:32,170;00:34:34,627;How happy I am
480;00:34:32,170;00:34:34,627;making weapons
481;00:34:34,628;00:34:37,086;for the family
481;00:34:34,628;00:34:37,086;that killed my father?
482;00:34:37,087;00:34:38,793;The family that
482;00:34:37,087;00:34:38,793;tried to kill me?
483;00:34:38,794;00:34:40,920;( scoffs )
484;00:34:40,921;00:34:43,170;I've been getting ready.
485;00:34:43,171;00:34:44,627;I never knew what for,
486;00:34:44,628;00:34:47,171;but I've always known
486;00:34:44,628;00:34:47,171;I'd know it when it comes.
487;00:34:48,837;00:34:51,919;You might want to bring
487;00:34:48,837;00:34:51,919;one of those swords.
488;00:34:51,920;00:34:53,837;I don't know much
488;00:34:51,920;00:34:53,837;about swinging swords.
489;00:34:55,337;00:34:56,670;But this...
490;00:34:58,503;00:34:59,837;this I know.
491;00:35:08,921;00:35:10,336;Keep your father's name
491;00:35:08,921;00:35:10,336;to yourself.
492;00:35:10,337;00:35:13,129;Situation's complicated
492;00:35:10,337;00:35:13,129;enough already.

494;00:35:20,004;00:35:22,419;I told you, Clovis, if we

498;00:35:31,545;00:35:34,046;It is.

503;00:35:46,212;00:35:48,461;You must be even older

507;00:35:59,922;00:36:02,046;doing business with you.

514;00:36:29,880;00:36:31,753;Davos:
514;00:36:29,880;00:36:31,753;Fermented crab.
515;00:36:31,754;00:36:34,753;One bucket of this triples a
