12;00:03:25,647;00:03:28,382;It had three eyes.
13;00:03:28,417;00:03:31,118;It told me to come
13;00:03:28,417;00:03:31,118;with him, so I did.
14;00:03:31,152;00:03:34,887;We went down into the crypts

17;00:03:41,761;00:03:44,429;just like Hodor.
18;00:03:44,464;00:03:46,598;I'm not afraid of some hole
18;00:03:44,464;00:03:46,598;in the ground.
19;00:03:46,633;00:03:49,869;You've lived beyond the Wall.
19;00:03:46,633;00:03:49,869;What are you scared of?
20;00:03:49,903;00:03:53,039;I'm a crippled boy

22;00:04:01,214;00:04:04,516;He was burned alive
22;00:04:01,214;00:04:04,516;by the Mad King Aerys.
23;00:04:06,120;00:04:07,954;That's Lyanna,

24;00:04:07,988;00:04:10,890;King Robert was
24;00:04:07,988;00:04:10,890;supposed to marry her,

25;00:04:10,925;00:04:13,994;kidnapped her.
26;00:04:14,028;00:04:16,496;Robert started a war
26;00:04:14,028;00:04:16,496;to win her back.
27;00:04:16,531;00:04:19,700;He killed Rhaegar,
27;00:04:16,531;00:04:19,700;but she died anyway.

33;00:04:43,190;00:04:46,392;He doesn't like chains.
33;00:04:43,190;00:04:46,392;What are you doing down here?
34;00:04:46,426;00:04:49,762;Come back up with us.
34;00:04:46,426;00:04:49,762;No, I came to see father.
35;00:04:49,796;00:04:52,431;How many times have I told you?
35;00:04:49,796;00:04:52,431;He's in King's Landing

130;00:11:49,624;00:11:52,691;My mother tells me a King
130;00:11:49,624;00:11:52,691;should never strike his lady.
131;00:11:53,860;00:11:55,628;Ser Meryn.
132;00:12:17,150;00:12:19,484;Here, girl.
133;00:12:23,289;00:12:24,889;Will you obey now?
134;00:12:24,923;00:12:27,458;Or do you need
134;00:12:24,923;00:12:27,458;another lesson?
135;00:12:30,529;00:12:33,198;I'll look for you
135;00:12:30,529;00:12:33,198;in court.
136;00:12:35,701;00:12:38,303;Save yourself
136;00:12:35,701;00:12:38,303;some pain, girl.
137;00:12:38,337;00:12:40,305;Give him what he wants.
138;00:12:41,407;00:12:44,075;You'll be
138;00:12:41,407;00:12:44,075;needing that again.
139;00:13:04,965;00:13:07,533;The proper course
139;00:13:04,965;00:13:07,533;is clear:
140;00:13:07,568;00:13:10,003;Pledge fealty to King Renly
140;00:13:07,568;00:13:10,003;and move south
141;00:13:10,037;00:13:12,072;to join our forces
141;00:13:10,037;00:13:12,072;with his.
142;00:13:12,106;00:13:14,841;Renly is not the King.
143;00:13:14,876;00:13:18,111;You cannot mean
143;00:13:14,876;00:13:18,111;to hold to Joffrey, My Lord.
144;00:13:18,145;00:13:19,946;He put your father
144;00:13:18,145;00:13:19,946;to death.
145;00:13:19,980;00:13:21,881;That doesn't
145;00:13:19,980;00:13:21,881;make Renly King.
146;00:13:21,916;00:13:24,651;He's Robert's
146;00:13:21,916;00:13:24,651;youngest brother.
147;00:13:24,685;00:13:27,787;If Bran can't be Lord
147;00:13:24,685;00:13:27,787;of Winterfell before me,
148;00:13:27,821;00:13:29,789;Renly can't be King
148;00:13:27,821;00:13:29,789;before Stannis.
149;00:13:29,823;00:13:31,891;Do you mean to declare us
149;00:13:29,823;00:13:31,891;for Stannis?
150;00:13:31,925;00:13:33,774;Renly is not right!
150;00:13:31,925;00:13:33,774;My Lords.
151;00:13:33,775;00:13:35,544;If we put ourselves
151;00:13:33,775;00:13:35,544;behind Stannis--
152;00:13:35,569;00:13:36,769;My Lords!
153;00:13:37,664;00:13:40,766;Here is what I say
153;00:13:37,664;00:13:40,766;to these two Kings--
154;00:13:43,870;00:13:46,438;Renly Baratheon
154;00:13:43,870;00:13:46,438;is nothing to me,
155;00:13:46,473;00:13:48,841;nor Stannis neither.
156;00:13:48,875;00:13:51,410;Why should they rule
156;00:13:48,875;00:13:51,410;over me and mine
157;00:13:51,444;00:13:53,579;from some flowery seat
157;00:13:51,444;00:13:53,579;in the South?
158;00:13:53,613;00:13:57,816;What do they know of the Wall
158;00:13:53,613;00:13:57,816;or the Wolfswood?
159;00:13:58,718;00:14:00,819;Even their Gods
159;00:13:58,718;00:14:00,819;are wrong!
160;00:14:04,824;00:14:07,159;Why shouldn't we rule
160;00:14:04,824;00:14:07,159;ourselves again?
161;00:14:07,193;00:14:10,329;It was the Dragons
161;00:14:07,193;00:14:10,329;we bowed to
162;00:14:10,363;00:14:13,432;and now the Dragons
162;00:14:10,363;00:14:13,432;are dead!
163;00:14:14,968;00:14:17,770;There sits the only King
164;00:14:17,804;00:14:21,040;I mean to bend
164;00:14:17,804;00:14:21,040;my knee to--
165;00:14:21,074;00:14:23,475;the King
165;00:14:21,074;00:14:23,475;in the North!
166;00:14:31,151;00:14:32,918;I'll have peace
166;00:14:31,151;00:14:32,918;on those terms.
167;00:14:32,953;00:14:35,622;They can keep
167;00:14:32,953;00:14:35,622;their Red Castle
168;00:14:35,656;00:14:38,525;and their Iron Chair too.
169;00:14:39,894;00:14:41,528;The King
169;00:14:39,894;00:14:41,528;in the North!
170;00:14:43,364;00:14:46,433;Am I your brother,
170;00:14:43,364;00:14:46,433;now and always?
171;00:14:46,467;00:14:48,068;Now and always.
172;00:14:51,841;00:14:54,743;My sword is yours,
172;00:14:51,841;00:14:54,743;in victory and defeat
173;00:14:54,777;00:14:57,880;from this day
173;00:14:54,777;00:14:57,880;until my last day.
174;00:14:59,048;00:15:00,482;The King
174;00:14:59,048;00:15:00,482;in the North!
175;00:15:00,517;00:15:04,420;The King in the North!
175;00:15:00,517;00:15:04,420;The King in the North!
176;00:15:04,454;00:15:06,956;The King
176;00:15:04,454;00:15:06,956;in the North!
177;00:15:06,990;00:15:09,858;The King in the North!
177;00:15:06,990;00:15:09,858;The King in the North!
178;00:15:09,892;00:15:11,959;The King
178;00:15:09,892;00:15:11,959;in the North!
179;00:15:11,994;00:15:14,094;The King in the North!
180;00:15:14,129;00:15:16,230;The King
180;00:15:14,129;00:15:16,230;in the North!
181;00:15:16,264;00:15:17,898;The King in the North!
182;00:15:17,933;00:15:23,904;The King in the North!
182;00:15:17,933;00:15:23,904;The King in the North!
183;00:15:28,043;00:15:30,778;Lady Stark.
183;00:15:28,043;00:15:30,778;I want to see him.
184;00:15:31,780;00:15:33,480;Now!
185;00:15:53,535;00:15:55,102;Leave us.
186;00:16:01,176;00:16:03,611;You look lovely
186;00:16:01,176;00:16:03,611;tonight, Lady Stark.
187;00:16:03,645;00:16:06,046;Widowhood becomes you.
188;00:16:08,416;00:16:10,817;Your bed must be lonely.
189;00:16:10,852;00:16:12,619;Is that why you came?
190;00:16:12,654;00:16:15,255;I'm not at my best,
191;00:16:15,289;00:16:17,491;but I think I could
191;00:16:15,289;00:16:17,491;be of service.
192;00:16:17,525;00:16:21,361;You slip out of that gown
192;00:16:17,525;00:16:21,361;and we'll see if I'm up to it.
193;00:16:25,699;00:16:28,868;Oh, I do like
193;00:16:25,699;00:16:28,868;a violent woman.
194;00:16:28,902;00:16:31,838;I will kill you
194;00:16:28,902;00:16:31,838;tonight, Ser,
195;00:16:31,873;00:16:35,676;pack your head in a box
195;00:16:31,873;00:16:35,676;and send it to your sister.
196;00:16:35,710;00:16:37,211;Let me show you how--
197;00:16:37,245;00:16:39,747;hit me again,
197;00:16:37,245;00:16:39,747;over the ear.
198;00:16:39,781;00:16:41,715;And again and again.
199;00:16:41,750;00:16:44,752;You're stronger than you look--
199;00:16:41,750;00:16:44,752;it shouldn't take long.
200;00:16:44,786;00:16:46,720;That is what you want
200;00:16:44,786;00:16:46,720;the world to believe,
201;00:16:46,755;00:16:48,589;isn't it?
201;00:16:46,755;00:16:48,589;That you don't fear death.
202;00:16:48,623;00:16:50,457;But I don't, My Lady.
203;00:16:50,491;00:16:54,027;The dark is coming for all of us.
203;00:16:50,491;00:16:54,027;Why cry about it?
204;00:16:54,061;00:16:56,629;Because you are going
204;00:16:54,061;00:16:56,629;to the deepest
205;00:16:56,664;00:16:59,065;of the Seven Hells,
205;00:16:56,664;00:16:59,065;if the Gods are just.
206;00:16:59,099;00:17:01,267;What Gods are those?
207;00:17:01,301;00:17:04,003;The trees your husband
207;00:17:01,301;00:17:04,003;prayed to?
208;00:17:05,673;00:17:08,608;Where were the trees when his
208;00:17:05,673;00:17:08,608;head was getting chopped off?
209;00:17:08,642;00:17:11,578;If your Gods are real
209;00:17:08,642;00:17:11,578;and if they are just,
210;00:17:11,612;00:17:14,747;why is the world
210;00:17:11,612;00:17:14,747;so full of injustice?
211;00:17:16,049;00:17:19,018;Because of men like you.
212;00:17:19,053;00:17:21,688;There are no men like me.
213;00:17:22,590;00:17:24,691;Only me.
214;00:17:29,497;00:17:32,200;My son Bran.
215;00:17:33,402;00:17:35,803;How did he come to fall
215;00:17:33,402;00:17:35,803;from that tower?
216;00:17:35,838;00:17:38,406;I pushed him
216;00:17:35,838;00:17:38,406;out the window.
217;00:17:40,576;00:17:42,410;Why?
218;00:17:43,645;00:17:46,882;I hoped the fall
218;00:17:43,645;00:17:46,882;would kill him.
219;00:17:46,916;00:17:48,950;Why?
220;00:17:56,758;00:17:58,693;You should get some sleep.
221;00:17:58,727;00:18:01,129;It's going to be
221;00:17:58,727;00:18:01,129;a long war.
222;00:18:25,557;00:18:28,491;I can't believe
222;00:18:25,557;00:18:28,491;we're actually at war.
223;00:18:29,961;00:18:32,796;Was it this exciting last time,
223;00:18:29,961;00:18:32,796;when you were young?
224;00:18:36,301;00:18:38,602;What does it say?
225;00:18:39,671;00:18:41,738;Have we captured
225;00:18:39,671;00:18:41,738;Robb Stark yet?
226;00:18:41,773;00:18:44,674;What's our next move?
226;00:18:41,773;00:18:44,674;Stop talking.
227;00:18:45,943;00:18:47,911;Get back into bed.
228;00:18:55,752;00:18:57,886;They have my son.
229;00:19:00,890;00:19:03,625;The Stark boy appears
229;00:19:00,890;00:19:03,625;to be less green than we'd hoped.
230;00:19:03,660;00:19:06,929;I've heard his wolf killed a doze
230;00:19:03,660;00:19:06,929;men and as many horses.
231;00:19:06,963;00:19:08,730;Is it true about
231;00:19:06,963;00:19:08,730;Stannis and Renly?
232;00:19:08,765;00:19:11,533;Both Baratheon brothers
232;00:19:08,765;00:19:11,533;have taken up against us.
233;00:19:11,568;00:19:14,136;Jaime captured,
233;00:19:11,568;00:19:14,136;his armies scattered...
234;00:19:14,170;00:19:16,071;It's a catastrophe.
235;00:19:17,106;00:19:19,107;Perhaps we should
235;00:19:17,106;00:19:19,107;sue for peace.
236;00:19:22,445;00:19:24,714;There's your peace.
237;00:19:24,748;00:19:28,717;Joffrey saw to that when h
237;00:19:24,748;00:19:28,717;decided to remove Ned Stark's head.
238;00:19:28,752;00:19:32,188;You'll have an easier time
238;00:19:28,752;00:19:32,188;drinking from that cup
239;00:19:32,222;00:19:35,525;than you will bringing Robb Stark
239;00:19:32,222;00:19:35,525;to the table now.
240;00:19:35,559;00:19:37,060;He's winning...
241;00:19:37,094;00:19:39,062;in case you
241;00:19:37,094;00:19:39,062;hadn't noticed.
242;00:19:39,096;00:19:40,597;I'm told we still
242;00:19:39,096;00:19:40,597;have his sisters.
243;00:19:40,631;00:19:43,266;The first order of business
243;00:19:40,631;00:19:43,266;is ransoming Ser Jaime.
244;00:19:43,301;00:19:45,169;No truces.
244;00:19:43,301;00:19:45,169;We can't afford to look weak.
245;00:19:45,203;00:19:46,804;We should march
245;00:19:45,203;00:19:46,804;on them at once.
246;00:19:46,838;00:19:49,440;First we must return
246;00:19:46,838;00:19:49,440;to Casterly Rock to raise--
247;00:19:49,474;00:19:51,942;They have my son!
248;00:19:54,579;00:19:56,681;Get out, all of you.
249;00:20:07,159;00:20:09,394;Not you.
250;00:20:24,276;00:20:27,179;You were right
250;00:20:24,276;00:20:27,179;about Eddard Stark.
251;00:20:28,981;00:20:31,015;If he were alive,
251;00:20:28,981;00:20:31,015;we could have used him
252;00:20:31,049;00:20:34,318;to broker a peace
252;00:20:31,049;00:20:34,318;with Winterfell and Riverrun,
253;00:20:34,353;00:20:36,687;which would have
253;00:20:34,353;00:20:36,687;given us more time
254;00:20:36,721;00:20:39,557;to deal with Robert's brothers.
254;00:20:36,721;00:20:39,557;But now...
255;00:20:40,793;00:20:43,828;Madness--
255;00:20:40,793;00:20:43,828;madness and stupidity.
256;00:20:46,699;00:20:49,835;I always thought
256;00:20:46,699;00:20:49,835;you were a stunted fool.
257;00:20:51,505;00:20:53,138;Perhaps I was wrong.
258;00:20:53,140;00:20:55,442;Half wrong.
259;00:20:56,877;00:20:59,213;I'm new to strategy, but--
260;00:20:59,247;00:21:01,481;unless we want to be
260;00:20:59,247;00:21:01,481;surrounded by three armies,
261;00:21:01,516;00:21:03,550;it appears we can't
261;00:21:01,516;00:21:03,550;stay here.
262;00:21:03,585;00:21:05,485;No one will stay here.
263;00:21:05,519;00:21:08,954;Ser Gregor will head out
263;00:21:05,519;00:21:08,954;with 500 riders
264;00:21:08,989;00:21:12,892;and set the Riverland on fire
264;00:21:08,989;00:21:12,892;from God's Eye to the Red Fork.
265;00:21:12,926;00:21:16,395;The rest of us will
265;00:21:12,926;00:21:16,395;regroup at Harrenhal.
266;00:21:18,498;00:21:20,633;And you will go
266;00:21:18,498;00:21:20,633;to King's Landing.
267;00:21:20,667;00:21:22,868;And do what?
268;00:21:22,903;00:21:24,804;Rule!
269;00:21:24,838;00:21:27,706;You will serve as Hand
269;00:21:24,838;00:21:27,706;of the King in my stead.
270;00:21:27,740;00:21:31,776;You will bring that boy King to heel
270;00:21:27,740;00:21:31,776;and his mother too, if needs be.
271;00:21:31,810;00:21:35,480;And if you get so much as a whiff
271;00:21:31,810;00:21:35,480;of treason from any of the rest:
272;00:21:35,515;00:21:38,550;Baelish, Varys, Pycelle--
272;00:21:35,515;00:21:38,550;Heads, spikes, walls.
273;00:21:38,585;00:21:41,787;Why not my Uncle?
274;00:21:41,821;00:21:44,389;Why not anyone?
274;00:21:41,821;00:21:44,389;Why me?
275;00:21:44,424;00:21:46,992;You're my son.
276;00:21:54,201;00:21:56,502;Oh, one more thing:
277;00:21:56,537;00:21:59,939;You will not take
277;00:21:56,537;00:21:59,939;the whore to court.
278;00:21:59,973;00:22:01,907;Do you understand?
279;00:22:21,160;00:22:23,795;Ser Jorah?
280;00:22:27,199;00:22:30,368;Gently gently.
281;00:22:32,103;00:22:33,837;My son...
282;00:22:33,871;00:22:36,373;Where is he?
282;00:22:33,871;00:22:36,373;I want him.
283;00:22:39,009;00:22:40,777;Where is he?
284;00:22:42,881;00:22:45,115;The boy did not live.
285;00:22:52,158;00:22:54,926;Tell me.
285;00:22:52,158;00:22:54,926;What is there to tell?
286;00:22:54,961;00:22:57,362;How did my son die?!
287;00:22:58,798;00:23:01,867;He never lived,
287;00:22:58,798;00:23:01,867;My Princess.
288;00:23:01,902;00:23:03,969;The women say...
289;00:23:04,004;00:23:05,771;What do the women say?
290;00:23:08,341;00:23:11,644;They say the child was--
290;00:23:08,341;00:23:11,644;Monstrous,
291;00:23:11,678;00:23:13,312;twisted.
292;00:23:13,346;00:23:15,347;I pulled him out
292;00:23:13,346;00:23:15,347;myself.
293;00:23:16,783;00:23:19,251;He was scaled
293;00:23:16,783;00:23:19,251;like a lizard,
294;00:23:19,285;00:23:23,655;blind, with leather wings
294;00:23:19,285;00:23:23,655;like the wings of a bat.
295;00:23:23,690;00:23:26,925;When I touched him
295;00:23:23,690;00:23:26,925;the skin fell from his bones.
296;00:23:26,959;00:23:30,896;Inside he was
296;00:23:26,959;00:23:30,896;full of graveworms.
297;00:23:33,166;00:23:37,670;I warned you that only death
297;00:23:33,166;00:23:37,670;can pay for life.
298;00:23:37,704;00:23:39,839;You knew the price.
299;00:23:39,873;00:23:42,809;Where is Khal Drogo?
300;00:23:42,843;00:23:44,944;Show him to me.
301;00:23:44,978;00:23:47,513;Show me what I bought
302;00:23:47,547;00:23:50,449;with my son's life.
303;00:23:50,483;00:23:52,551;As you command, lady.
304;00:23:52,585;00:23:54,252;Come.
305;00:23:54,286;00:23:56,087;I will take you
305;00:23:54,286;00:23:56,087;to him.
306;00:23:56,121;00:23:59,056;Time enough for that later--
306;00:23:56,121;00:23:59,056;I want to see him now.
307;00:24:14,775;00:24:17,010;The Khalasar is gone.
308;00:24:17,044;00:24:19,646;A Khal who cannot ride
308;00:24:17,044;00:24:19,646;is no Khal.
309;00:24:19,681;00:24:22,516;The Dothraki
309;00:24:19,681;00:24:22,516;follow only the strong.
310;00:24:22,550;00:24:25,218;I'm sorry, My Princess.
311;00:24:37,065;00:24:38,165;Drogo!
312;00:24:42,303;00:24:44,204;Why is he out here alone?
313;00:24:44,239;00:24:47,007;He seems to like
313;00:24:44,239;00:24:47,007;the warmth, Princess.
314;00:24:51,246;00:24:52,980;He lives.
315;00:24:53,014;00:24:55,816;You asked for life,
315;00:24:53,014;00:24:55,816;you paid for life.
316;00:24:55,850;00:24:59,452;This is not life.
316;00:24:55,850;00:24:59,452;When will he be as he was?
317;00:24:59,487;00:25:01,855;When the sun rises in the west,
317;00:24:59,487;00:25:01,855;sets in the east
318;00:25:01,890;00:25:03,924;when the seas go dry.
319;00:25:03,958;00:25:07,728;When the mountains blow
319;00:25:03,958;00:25:07,728;in the wind like leaves.
320;00:25:22,879;00:25:24,580;Leave us.
321;00:25:26,082;00:25:28,317;I don't want you alone
321;00:25:26,082;00:25:28,317;with this sorceress.
322;00:25:28,352;00:25:31,554;I have nothing more
322;00:25:28,352;00:25:31,554;to fear from this woman.
323;00:25:32,456;00:25:34,056;Go.
324;00:25:39,896;00:25:43,232;You knew what I was buying
324;00:25:39,896;00:25:43,232;and you knew the price.
325;00:25:43,266;00:25:46,134;It was wrong of them
325;00:25:43,266;00:25:46,134;to burn my temple.
326;00:25:46,169;00:25:50,105;It angered the Great Shepherd.
326;00:25:46,169;00:25:50,105;This is not God's work.
327;00:25:50,139;00:25:52,774;My child was innocent.
327;00:25:50,139;00:25:52,774;Innocent?
328;00:25:52,808;00:25:56,077;He would have been the stallion
328;00:25:52,808;00:25:56,077;who mounts the world.
329;00:25:56,111;00:25:57,556;Now he will burn no cities.
330;00:25:57,581;00:26:00,132;Now his Khalasar will trample
330;00:25:57,581;00:26:00,132;no nations into dust.
331;00:26:00,516;00:26:02,851;I spoke for you.
332;00:26:02,885;00:26:05,087;I saved you.
333;00:26:05,121;00:26:07,722;Saved me?
334;00:26:07,756;00:26:09,857;Three of those riders
334;00:26:07,756;00:26:09,857;had already
335;00:26:09,892;00:26:12,627;raped me before
335;00:26:09,892;00:26:12,627;you saved me, girl.
336;00:26:15,731;00:26:18,333;I saw my God's house burn,
337;00:26:18,367;00:26:22,737;there where I had healed men
337;00:26:18,367;00:26:22,737;and women beyond counting.
338;00:26:22,771;00:26:25,439;In the streets
338;00:26:22,771;00:26:25,439;I saw piles of heads--
339;00:26:25,474;00:26:28,009;the head of the Baker
339;00:26:25,474;00:26:28,009;who makes my bread,
340;00:26:28,043;00:26:29,443;the head of a young boy
341;00:26:29,478;00:26:32,313;that I had cured of fever
341;00:26:29,478;00:26:32,313;just three moons past.
342;00:26:32,347;00:26:36,317;So tell me again
342;00:26:32,347;00:26:36,317;exactly what it was
343;00:26:36,351;00:26:37,719;that you saved.
344;00:26:37,753;00:26:39,687;Your life.
345;00:26:39,721;00:26:41,722;Hmph.
346;00:26:41,757;00:26:44,358;Why don't you take
346;00:26:41,757;00:26:44,358;a look at your Khal...
347;00:26:46,128;00:26:48,963;Then you will see
347;00:26:46,128;00:26:48,963;exactly what life is worth
348;00:26:48,997;00:26:51,799;when all the rest has gone.
349;00:27:04,479;00:27:06,714;You can't!
350;00:27:06,748;00:27:08,950;Get out of my way, Sam.
351;00:27:08,984;00:27:11,285;They'll put out the word.
352;00:27:11,320;00:27:14,222;They'll send out ravens.
352;00:27:11,320;00:27:14,222;People will come after you.
353;00:27:14,256;00:27:17,092;Do you know what happens
353;00:27:14,256;00:27:17,092;to deserters?
354;00:27:19,995;00:27:21,696;Better than you do.
355;00:27:21,730;00:27:24,399;What are you going to do?
356;00:27:24,433;00:27:26,334;I'm gonna find my brother
357;00:27:26,369;00:27:29,404;and put a sword through
357;00:27:26,369;00:27:29,404;King Joffrey's throat.
358;00:27:30,573;00:27:33,709;You can't leave us now.
358;00:27:30,573;00:27:33,709;We need you here.
359;00:27:33,743;00:27:37,746;Move.
359;00:27:33,743;00:27:37,746;I won't let you go.
360;00:27:37,780;00:27:40,682;Move.
360;00:27:37,780;00:27:40,682;No.
361;00:27:41,551;00:27:43,418;Hyah!
362;00:27:58,270;00:28:01,072;Hand of the King?
363;00:28:01,106;00:28:03,107;So it would seem.
364;00:28:03,141;00:28:07,645;And your father said you couldn't take
364;00:28:03,141;00:28:07,645;anyone with you to King's Landing.
365;00:28:07,679;00:28:10,615;No, he said I couldn't take you
365;00:28:07,679;00:28:10,615;with me to King's Landing.
366;00:28:10,649;00:28:12,317;He was very specific
366;00:28:10,649;00:28:12,317;on that point.
367;00:28:12,351;00:28:14,352;He knew my name?
368;00:28:14,386;00:28:16,120;What?
369;00:28:16,154;00:28:18,722;He said, Don't bring Shae
369;00:28:16,154;00:28:18,722;with you to King's Landing?
370;00:28:18,757;00:28:21,858;I believe he used
370;00:28:18,757;00:28:21,858;the word whore.
371;00:28:23,027;00:28:24,994;Are you ashamed of me?
372;00:28:25,029;00:28:28,064;Are you afraid that I'm dancing
372;00:28:25,029;00:28:28,064;around the court with my tits out?
373;00:28:28,098;00:28:31,200;I'm funny now?
374;00:28:31,235;00:28:33,436;I'm Shae the funny whore.
375;00:28:34,905;00:28:37,907;My father's probably the most
375;00:28:34,905;00:28:37,907;powerful man in the country.
376;00:28:37,941;00:28:39,208;Certainly the richest.
377;00:28:39,243;00:28:41,844;He has all Seven Kingdoms
377;00:28:39,243;00:28:41,844;in his pockets.
378;00:28:41,878;00:28:43,679;Everyone everywhere
379;00:28:43,713;00:28:46,849;always has to do exactly
379;00:28:43,713;00:28:46,849;what my father says.
380;00:28:48,318;00:28:50,286;He's always been a cunt.
381;00:28:57,228;00:28:58,895;I believe the ladies
381;00:28:57,228;00:28:58,895;of the court
382;00:28:58,930;00:29:02,032;could learn a great deal
382;00:28:58,930;00:29:02,032;from a girl like you.
383;00:29:04,269;00:29:06,003;Why don't you
383;00:29:04,269;00:29:06,003;come with me,
384;00:29:06,037;00:29:08,772;be the Hand's lady?
385;00:29:10,308;00:29:12,976;Because the King needs
385;00:29:10,308;00:29:12,976;a Hand and the Hand--
386;00:29:17,348;00:29:20,084;I know what
386;00:29:17,348;00:29:20,084;a Hand needs.
387;00:29:33,098;00:29:35,033;Ghost?
387;00:29:33,098;00:29:35,033;Hyah!
388;00:29:35,067;00:29:37,936;Hyah.
388;00:29:35,067;00:29:37,936;Hyah!
389;00:29:41,341;00:29:42,975;Hyah.
390;00:29:45,612;00:29:48,514;Samwell!
391;00:29:49,783;00:29:52,418;- Is he dead?
391;00:29:49,783;00:29:52,418;- No, he's not dead.
392;00:29:52,452;00:29:54,020;Did we get him?
393;00:29:54,054;00:29:56,155;Come on, help me
393;00:29:54,054;00:29:56,155;get him up.
394;00:29:58,459;00:30:01,694;Lucky you've got
394;00:29:58,459;00:30:01,694;plenty of padding.
395;00:30:03,564;00:30:05,565;We're taking you back
395;00:30:03,564;00:30:05,565;to where you belong.
396;00:30:05,599;00:30:08,201;I belong with my brother.
396;00:30:05,599;00:30:08,201;But we're your brothers now.
397;00:30:08,235;00:30:10,503;They'll kill you if they find out
397;00:30:08,235;00:30:10,503;you've gone.
398;00:30:10,537;00:30:12,638;They'll kill you if they know
398;00:30:10,537;00:30:12,638;you came after me.
399;00:30:12,673;00:30:15,675;Go back.
399;00:30:12,673;00:30:15,675;Sam told us everything.
400;00:30:15,709;00:30:18,578;We're sorry about your father.
400;00:30:15,709;00:30:18,578;But it doesn't matter.
401;00:30:18,612;00:30:20,847;You took the oath.
401;00:30:18,612;00:30:20,847;You can't leave.
402;00:30:20,881;00:30:23,016;I have to.
402;00:30:20,881;00:30:23,016;You can't.
403;00:30:23,050;00:30:25,552;You said the words.
403;00:30:23,050;00:30:25,552;I don't care about--
404;00:30:25,587;00:30:28,722;Hear my words and bear
404;00:30:25,587;00:30:28,722;witness to my vow...
405;00:30:28,757;00:30:30,694;To hell with all of you.
406;00:30:30,719;00:30:33,041;Night gathers and now
406;00:30:30,719;00:30:33,041;my Watch begins.
407;00:30:33,195;00:30:36,531;It shall not end
407;00:30:33,195;00:30:36,531;until my death.
408;00:30:36,565;00:30:38,332;I shall live and die
408;00:30:36,565;00:30:38,332;at my post.
409;00:30:38,367;00:30:40,268;I am the sword
409;00:30:38,367;00:30:40,268;in the darkness...
410;00:30:40,302;00:30:42,336;...The Watcher on the Walls,
411;00:30:42,371;00:30:44,773;the shield that guards
411;00:30:42,371;00:30:44,773;the realms of men.
412;00:30:44,807;00:30:48,510;I pledge my life and honor
412;00:30:44,807;00:30:48,510;to the Night's Watch,
413;00:30:48,544;00:30:52,647;for this night
413;00:30:48,544;00:30:52,647;and all nights to come.
414;00:32:35,718;00:32:38,887;When the sun
415;00:32:38,922;00:32:41,323;rises in the west
416;00:32:41,358;00:32:44,793;and sets in the east...
417;00:32:47,430;00:32:51,499;Then you shall return
417;00:32:47,430;00:32:51,499;to me, my sun and stars.
418;00:33:58,734;00:34:01,169;Kings?
419;00:34:01,203;00:34:05,273;Oh, I can tell you all
419;00:34:01,203;00:34:05,273;there is to know about Kings.
420;00:34:06,909;00:34:10,445;The thing you need to
420;00:34:06,909;00:34:10,445;understand about Kings is...
421;00:34:15,118;00:34:19,021;For the past 67 years,
421;00:34:15,118;00:34:19,021;I've known--
422;00:34:19,056;00:34:24,127;truly known more Kings
422;00:34:19,056;00:34:24,127;than any man alive.
423;00:34:25,630;00:34:30,199;They're complicated men,
423;00:34:25,630;00:34:30,199;but I know how to serve them.
424;00:34:30,234;00:34:32,135;Yes.
425;00:34:32,169;00:34:34,771;And keep on serving them.
426;00:34:37,041;00:34:39,777;Aerys Targaryen...
427;00:34:39,811;00:34:45,282;of all the thousand thousand
427;00:34:39,811;00:34:45,282;maladies the Gods visit on us,
428;00:34:45,316;00:34:49,018;madness is the worst.
429;00:34:49,953;00:34:51,954;He was a good man,
430;00:34:51,988;00:34:55,157;such a charmer.
431;00:34:56,259;00:34:59,328;To watch him melt away
431;00:34:56,259;00:34:59,328;before my eyes,
432;00:34:59,362;00:35:01,396;consumed by dreams
433;00:35:01,431;00:35:04,599;of fire and blood...
434;00:35:07,303;00:35:09,605;Robert Baratheon
435;00:35:09,639;00:35:12,574;was an entirely different animal--
435;00:35:09,639;00:35:12,574;powerful man,
436;00:35:12,609;00:35:14,744;a great warrior--
437;00:35:14,778;00:35:17,747;but alas,
437;00:35:14,778;00:35:17,747;winning a Kingdom
438;00:35:17,781;00:35:21,718;and ruling a Kingdom
438;00:35:17,781;00:35:21,718;are rather different things.
439;00:35:21,752;00:35:24,053;They say that
440;00:35:24,121;00:35:27,523;if a man goes through life
440;00:35:24,121;00:35:27,523;with his battle visor down,
441;00:35:27,557;00:35:29,858;he can often be blind
442;00:35:29,892;00:35:32,728;to the enemies at his side.
443;00:35:34,663;00:35:38,366;Now I serve his son
444;00:35:38,400;00:35:40,634;King Joffrey,
445;00:35:40,669;00:35:42,870;may the Gods
445;00:35:40,669;00:35:42,870;bless his reign.
446;00:35:44,240;00:35:47,943;He is a capable young man--
446;00:35:44,240;00:35:47,943;strong military mind.
447;00:35:47,977;00:35:51,213;Stern...
448;00:35:51,247;00:35:55,218;But sternness in defense
448;00:35:51,247;00:35:55,218;of the realm is no vice.
449;00:35:56,687;00:35:59,889;It's far too soon to know what
449;00:35:56,687;00:35:59,889;manner of King he will be,
450;00:35:59,924;00:36:01,524;but I sense
451;00:36:01,559;00:36:06,595;true greatness on the horizon
451;00:36:01,559;00:36:06,595;for our new King.
452;00:36:08,665;00:36:11,066;True greatness.
453;00:36:15,305;00:36:17,438;So what's the thing?
454;00:36:19,208;00:36:20,908;What thing?
455;00:36:20,976;00:36:22,610;About Kings.
456;00:36:22,645;00:36:25,780;You said, the thing you need
456;00:36:22,645;00:36:25,780;to understand about Kings...
457;00:36:26,648;00:36:28,549;What? Things?
457;00:36:26,648;00:36:28,549;What?
458;00:36:28,583;00:36:31,385;When you started, you--
458;00:36:28,583;00:36:31,385;never mind.
459;00:36:33,020;00:36:35,455;Let me see you
459;00:36:33,020;00:36:35,455;out, my dear.
460;00:36:35,489;00:36:38,392;It's all right. No need.
460;00:36:35,489;00:36:38,392;Yes yes.
461;00:36:38,426;00:36:40,860;Till the next time.
462;00:37:00,780;00:37:02,748;Right.
463;00:37:28,709;00:37:32,178;When you imagine yourself up
463;00:37:28,709;00:37:32,178;there, how do you look?
464;00:37:32,213;00:37:36,383;Does the crown fit?
464;00:37:32,213;00:37:36,383;Do all the lords and ladies
465;00:37:36,417;00:37:40,253;simper and bow, the ones who
465;00:37:36,417;00:37:40,253;sneered at you for years?
466;00:37:40,287;00:37:43,589;It's hard for them to simper
466;00:37:40,287;00:37:43,589;and bow without heads.
467;00:37:44,891;00:37:47,393;A man with great ambition
467;00:37:44,891;00:37:47,393;and no morals--
468;00:37:47,428;00:37:49,795;I wouldn't
468;00:37:47,428;00:37:49,795;bet against you.
469;00:37:49,830;00:37:51,631;And what would you do,
469;00:37:49,830;00:37:51,631;my friend,
470;00:37:51,665;00:37:54,033;if you found yourself
470;00:37:51,665;00:37:54,033;sitting up there?
471;00:37:55,969;00:37:57,936;I must be one of the few men
471;00:37:55,969;00:37:57,936;in this city
472;00:37:57,971;00:37:59,605;who doesn't
472;00:37:57,971;00:37:59,605;want to be King.
473;00:37:59,639;00:38:01,674;You must be one
473;00:37:59,639;00:38:01,674;of the few men in the city
474;00:38:01,708;00:38:03,042;who isn't a man.
475;00:38:03,077;00:38:04,945;Oh, you can do
475;00:38:03,077;00:38:04,945;better than that.
476;00:38:09,283;00:38:12,585;When they castrated you, did they
476;00:38:09,283;00:38:12,585;take the pillar with the stones?
477;00:38:12,620;00:38:14,554;I've always wondered.
477;00:38:12,620;00:38:14,554;Have you?
478;00:38:14,588;00:38:17,591;Do you spend a lot of time wondering
478;00:38:14,588;00:38:17,591;what's between my legs?
479;00:38:17,625;00:38:20,727;I picture a gash
480;00:38:20,761;00:38:23,196;like a woman's.
480;00:38:20,761;00:38:23,196;Is that about right?
481;00:38:23,230;00:38:26,065;I am flattered, of course,
481;00:38:23,230;00:38:26,065;to be pictured at all.
482;00:38:26,099;00:38:29,668;Must be strange for you,
482;00:38:26,099;00:38:29,668;even after all these years--
483;00:38:29,703;00:38:32,738;a man from another land,
484;00:38:32,772;00:38:35,440;despised by most,
485;00:38:35,475;00:38:36,908;feared by all--
486;00:38:36,943;00:38:38,510;am I?
486;00:38:36,943;00:38:38,510;That is good to know.
487;00:38:38,544;00:38:41,813;Do you lie awake at night
487;00:38:38,544;00:38:41,813;fearing my gash?
488;00:38:41,847;00:38:45,750;But you carry on,
488;00:38:41,847;00:38:45,750;whispering in one King's ear
489;00:38:45,784;00:38:48,386;and then the next.
490;00:38:50,489;00:38:52,357;I admire you.
491;00:38:52,392;00:38:55,060;And I admire you,
491;00:38:52,392;00:38:55,060;Lord Baelish.
492;00:38:55,094;00:38:58,097;A grasper from a minor house
492;00:38:55,094;00:38:58,097;with a major talent
493;00:38:58,131;00:39:00,266;for befriending
493;00:38:58,131;00:39:00,266;powerful men--
494;00:39:00,300;00:39:01,397;and women.
495;00:39:01,422;00:39:03,148;A useful talent,
495;00:39:01,422;00:39:03,148;I'm sure you'd agree.
496;00:39:05,872;00:39:09,241;So here we stand...
497;00:39:09,275;00:39:12,477;In mutual admiration
497;00:39:09,275;00:39:12,477;and respect.
498;00:39:12,512;00:39:14,679;Playing our roles.
499;00:39:14,714;00:39:16,581;Serving a new King.
500;00:39:16,615;00:39:18,550;Long may he reign.
501;00:39:18,584;00:39:20,819;My King.
501;00:39:18,584;00:39:20,819;My King.
502;00:39:22,221;00:39:25,190;My Lords.
502;00:39:22,221;00:39:25,190;Shall we begin?
503;00:39:26,259;00:39:28,227;You're Arry now, hear me?
504;00:39:28,261;00:39:30,496;Arry the orphan boy.
505;00:39:30,530;00:39:32,798;No one asks an orphan
505;00:39:30,530;00:39:32,798;too many questions
506;00:39:32,832;00:39:35,034;'cause nobody gives
506;00:39:32,832;00:39:35,034;three shits.
507;00:39:35,069;00:39:36,369;What's your name?
508;00:39:36,403;00:39:38,171;Arry.
508;00:39:36,403;00:39:38,171;Ah.
509;00:39:38,206;00:39:41,775;We have a long way
509;00:39:38,206;00:39:41,775;to travel and in bad company.
510;00:39:41,809;00:39:43,977;I have 20 this time,
511;00:39:44,011;00:39:46,079;men and boys all
511;00:39:44,011;00:39:46,079;bound for the Wall.
512;00:39:46,113;00:39:49,816;Your Lord father gave me
512;00:39:46,113;00:39:49,816;the pick of the dungeons
513;00:39:49,850;00:39:52,985;and I didn't find
513;00:39:49,850;00:39:52,985;no little lordlings down there.
514;00:39:53,020;00:39:56,256;This lot, half of them would
514;00:39:53,020;00:39:56,256;turn you over to the King
515;00:39:56,290;00:39:58,391;quick as spit for a pardon.
516;00:39:58,425;00:40:00,460;And the other half
516;00:39:58,425;00:40:00,460;would do the same,
517;00:40:00,494;00:40:02,696;except they'd
517;00:40:00,494;00:40:02,696;rape you first.
518;00:40:02,730;00:40:05,031;So keep to yourself--
518;00:40:02,730;00:40:05,031;and when you piss,
519;00:40:05,066;00:40:07,233;do it in the woods alone.
520;00:40:08,869;00:40:10,936;You stay
520;00:40:08,869;00:40:10,936;with this lot, boy.
521;00:40:10,971;00:40:12,571;And stay--
522;00:40:12,606;00:40:16,442;or I'll lock you in the back of
522;00:40:12,606;00:40:16,442;the wagon with these three.
523;00:40:20,313;00:40:22,114;Watch yourself,
523;00:40:20,313;00:40:22,114;midget.
524;00:40:23,416;00:40:25,384;He's got a sword,
524;00:40:23,416;00:40:25,384;this one.
525;00:40:25,419;00:40:27,921;What's a gutter rat
525;00:40:25,419;00:40:27,921;like you doing with a sword?
526;00:40:27,955;00:40:31,158;Maybe he's a little squire.
526;00:40:27,955;00:40:31,158;He ain't no squire. Look at him.
527;00:40:31,192;00:40:32,793;He looks like a girl.
528;00:40:32,827;00:40:35,028;I bet he stole
528;00:40:32,827;00:40:35,028;that sword.
529;00:40:35,063;00:40:37,697;Let's have a look.
530;00:40:40,067;00:40:41,968;I could use me
530;00:40:40,067;00:40:41,968;a sword like that.
531;00:40:42,003;00:40:44,237;Take it off him.
531;00:40:42,003;00:40:44,237;Give it here, midget.
532;00:40:44,271;00:40:45,438;Look at him!
533;00:40:45,473;00:40:47,573;You'd better give
533;00:40:45,473;00:40:47,573;Hot Pie the sword.
534;00:40:47,608;00:40:49,309;I've seen him
534;00:40:47,608;00:40:49,309;kick a boy to death.
535;00:40:49,343;00:40:51,711;I knocked him down
535;00:40:49,343;00:40:51,711;and I kicked him in the balls
536;00:40:51,745;00:40:54,113;and I kept kicking him
536;00:40:51,745;00:40:54,113;until he was dead.
537;00:40:54,148;00:40:57,583;I kicked him
537;00:40:54,148;00:40:57,583;all to pieces.
538;00:40:57,617;00:41:00,653;You better give me that sword!
538;00:40:57,617;00:41:00,653;You want it?
539;00:41:00,687;00:41:02,521;I'll give it to you.
540;00:41:02,556;00:41:05,258;I already killed
540;00:41:02,556;00:41:05,258;one fat boy.
541;00:41:05,292;00:41:07,526;I bet you never
541;00:41:05,292;00:41:07,526;killed anyone.
542;00:41:07,561;00:41:10,596;I bet you're a liar.
542;00:41:07,561;00:41:10,596;But I'm not.
543;00:41:10,631;00:41:12,398;I'm good at killing
543;00:41:10,631;00:41:12,398;fat boys.
544;00:41:12,432;00:41:14,734;I like killing fat boys.
545;00:41:16,136;00:41:18,371;Oh, you like picking
545;00:41:16,136;00:41:18,371;on the little ones, do you?
546;00:41:18,405;00:41:21,241;You know, I've been hammering
546;00:41:18,405;00:41:21,241;an anvil these past 10 years.
547;00:41:21,275;00:41:24,311;When I hit
547;00:41:21,275;00:41:24,311;that steel, it sings.
548;00:41:24,345;00:41:26,646;Are you gonna sing
548;00:41:24,345;00:41:26,646;when I hit you?
549;00:41:33,287;00:41:35,521;This is
549;00:41:33,287;00:41:35,521;castle-forged steel.
550;00:41:35,555;00:41:37,689;Where'd you steal it?
551;00:41:37,724;00:41:40,158;It was a gift.
551;00:41:37,724;00:41:40,158;It don't matter now.
552;00:41:40,193;00:41:42,794;Where we're going,
552;00:41:40,193;00:41:42,794;they don't care what you've done.
553;00:41:42,829;00:41:45,931;They've got rapers,
553;00:41:42,829;00:41:45,931;pickpockets, highwaymen--
554;00:41:45,965;00:41:48,033;murderers.
555;00:41:48,067;00:41:51,570;Which are you?
555;00:41:48,067;00:41:51,570;Armorer's apprentice.
556;00:41:52,906;00:41:55,574;But my master
556;00:41:52,906;00:41:55,574;got sick of me,
557;00:41:55,609;00:41:56,876;so here I am.
558;00:41:56,910;00:41:59,912;Come on, you sorry
558;00:41:56,910;00:41:59,912;sons of whores!
559;00:41:59,947;00:42:03,248;It's a thousand leagues
559;00:41:59,947;00:42:03,248;from here to the Wall
560;00:42:03,282;00:42:05,917;and winter is coming!
561;00:42:36,449;00:42:38,383;Ham.
562;00:42:38,418;00:42:40,886;How many days in a row
562;00:42:38,418;00:42:40,886;must a man be
563;00:42:40,921;00:42:43,523;expected to start
563;00:42:40,921;00:42:43,523;his day with ham?
564;00:42:43,557;00:42:46,526;Bring me some beer
564;00:42:43,557;00:42:46,526;at least.
565;00:42:48,562;00:42:50,497;You look exhausted.
566;00:42:50,531;00:42:52,766;Was your moonlight ride
566;00:42:50,531;00:42:52,766;that tiring?
567;00:42:56,404;00:42:58,271;Don't look so terrified.
568;00:42:58,306;00:43:01,175;If we beheaded everyone
568;00:42:58,306;00:43:01,175;that ran away for the night,
569;00:43:01,209;00:43:03,744;only ghosts
569;00:43:01,209;00:43:03,744;would guard the Wall.
570;00:43:03,778;00:43:07,315;At least you weren't
570;00:43:03,778;00:43:07,315;whoring in Mole's Town.
571;00:43:08,283;00:43:10,051;Honor made you leave,
572;00:43:10,085;00:43:11,887;honor brought you back.
573;00:43:12,855;00:43:15,056;My friends
573;00:43:12,855;00:43:15,056;brought me back.
574;00:43:15,091;00:43:17,827;I didn't say
574;00:43:15,091;00:43:17,827;it was your honor.
575;00:43:17,861;00:43:19,796;They killed my father.
576;00:43:19,830;00:43:22,599;And you're going to bring him
576;00:43:19,830;00:43:22,599;back to life, are you?
577;00:43:22,633;00:43:24,968;No? Good.
578;00:43:25,002;00:43:27,804;We've had enough
578;00:43:25,002;00:43:27,804;of that sort of thing.
579;00:43:28,972;00:43:30,873;Beyond the Wall,
579;00:43:28,972;00:43:30,873;the rangers are
580;00:43:30,908;00:43:33,375;reporting whole villages
580;00:43:30,908;00:43:33,375;abandoned.
581;00:43:33,410;00:43:36,779;At night they see fires
581;00:43:33,410;00:43:36,779;blazing in the mountains
582;00:43:36,813;00:43:38,880;from dusk until dawn.
583;00:43:38,914;00:43:43,551;A captured wildling swears their tribes
583;00:43:38,914;00:43:43,551;are uniting in some secret stronghold,
584;00:43:43,586;00:43:47,189;to what ends
584;00:43:43,586;00:43:47,189;the Gods only know.
585;00:43:47,223;00:43:49,457;Outside Eastwatch
586;00:43:49,492;00:43:52,861;Cotter Pyke's men discovered four
586;00:43:49,492;00:43:52,861;blue-eyed corpses.
587;00:43:52,895;00:43:57,298;Unlike us, they were wise enough
587;00:43:52,895;00:43:57,298;to burn them.
588;00:43:59,234;00:44:02,370;Do you think
588;00:43:59,234;00:44:02,370;your brother's war
589;00:44:02,404;00:44:04,905;is more important
589;00:44:02,404;00:44:04,905;than ours?
590;00:44:06,074;00:44:09,644;No.
590;00:44:06,074;00:44:09,644;When dead men and worse
591;00:44:09,678;00:44:12,580;come hunting for us in the night,
591;00:44:09,678;00:44:12,580;do you think it matters
592;00:44:12,614;00:44:15,117;who sits
592;00:44:12,614;00:44:15,117;on the Iron Throne?
593;00:44:15,151;00:44:17,586;No.
593;00:44:15,151;00:44:17,586;Good.
594;00:44:17,620;00:44:20,490;Because I want you
594;00:44:17,620;00:44:20,490;and your wolf with us
595;00:44:20,524;00:44:23,726;when we ride out
595;00:44:20,524;00:44:23,726;beyond the Wall tomorrow.
596;00:44:24,728;00:44:26,862;Beyond the Wall?
597;00:44:26,897;00:44:28,631;I'll not sit meekly by
598;00:44:28,665;00:44:30,599;and wait for the snows.
599;00:44:30,634;00:44:33,035;I mean to find out
599;00:44:30,634;00:44:33,035;what's happening.
600;00:44:33,069;00:44:35,738;The Night's Watch will
600;00:44:33,069;00:44:35,738;ride in force
601;00:44:35,773;00:44:38,374;against the wildlings,
601;00:44:35,773;00:44:38,374;the White Walkers
602;00:44:38,409;00:44:40,410;and whatever else
602;00:44:38,409;00:44:40,410;is out there.
603;00:44:43,081;00:44:45,749;And we will find Benjen Stark,
604;00:44:45,783;00:44:47,985;alive or dead.
605;00:44:48,019;00:44:51,255;I will command them
605;00:44:48,019;00:44:51,255;myself.
606;00:44:51,289;00:44:53,490;So I'll only ask you once,
606;00:44:51,289;00:44:53,490;Lord Snow...
607;00:44:53,525;00:44:56,160;Move out!
608;00:44:56,194;00:44:58,863;...Are you a brother
608;00:44:56,194;00:44:58,863;of the Night's Watch
609;00:44:58,897;00:45:02,700;or a bastard boy
609;00:44:58,897;00:45:02,700;who wants to play at war?
610;00:45:45,311;00:45:48,746;Drogo will have no use for
610;00:45:45,311;00:45:48,746;dragon eggs in the Night Lands.
611;00:45:48,781;00:45:51,916;Sell them. You can return
611;00:45:48,781;00:45:51,916;to the Free Cities
612;00:45:51,950;00:45:54,285;and live as a wealthy woman
612;00:45:51,950;00:45:54,285;for all your days.
613;00:45:54,320;00:45:56,821;They were not
613;00:45:54,320;00:45:56,821;given to me to sell.
614;00:46:02,294;00:46:04,862;Khaleesi, My Queen,
615;00:46:04,897;00:46:08,233;I vow to serve you,
615;00:46:04,897;00:46:08,233;obey you,
616;00:46:08,267;00:46:10,602;to die for you
616;00:46:08,267;00:46:10,602;if need be,
617;00:46:10,636;00:46:13,405;but let him go,
617;00:46:10,636;00:46:13,405;Khaleesi.
618;00:46:13,440;00:46:16,208;I know what you intend.
618;00:46:13,440;00:46:16,208;Do not.
619;00:46:16,243;00:46:19,078;I must.
620;00:46:19,112;00:46:21,213;You don't understand--
621;00:46:21,281;00:46:24,750;don't ask me to stand aside
621;00:46:21,281;00:46:24,750;as you climb on that pyre.
622;00:46:24,784;00:46:27,286;I won't watch you burn.
623;00:46:28,923;00:46:31,091;Is that what you fear?
624;00:46:50,010;00:46:52,812;You will be my Khalasar.
625;00:46:52,846;00:46:56,282;I see the faces of slaves.
626;00:46:56,316;00:46:58,951;I free you.
627;00:46:58,985;00:47:03,689;Take off your collars. Go if yo
627;00:46:58,985;00:47:03,689;wish, no one will stop you.
628;00:47:03,723;00:47:06,192;But if you stay,
629;00:47:06,226;00:47:09,896;it will be as
629;00:47:06,226;00:47:09,896;brothers and sisters,
630;00:47:09,964;00:47:13,566;as husbands and wives.
631;00:47:24,277;00:47:26,812;Ser Jorah, bind this woman
631;00:47:24,277;00:47:26,812;to the pyre.
632;00:47:29,450;00:47:31,785;You swore to obey me.
633;00:47:40,730;00:47:43,399;I am Daenerys Stormborn
634;00:47:43,433;00:47:46,201;of House Targaryen
635;00:47:46,235;00:47:48,470;of the blood of Old Valyria.
636;00:47:48,504;00:47:51,106;I am the Dragon's daughter.
637;00:47:51,140;00:47:53,575;And I swear to you
638;00:47:53,610;00:47:57,180;that those who would harm you
638;00:47:53,610;00:47:57,180;will die screaming.
639;00:47:57,214;00:47:59,082;You will not
639;00:47:57,214;00:47:59,082;hear me scream.
640;00:47:59,116;00:48:01,150;I will.
