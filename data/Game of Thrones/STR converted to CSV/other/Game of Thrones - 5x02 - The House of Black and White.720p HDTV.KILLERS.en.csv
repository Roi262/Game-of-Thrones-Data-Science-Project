258;00:19:40,670;00:19:43,004;Return from where?
259;00:19:43,056;00:19:45,507;As far south
259;00:19:43,056;00:19:45,507;as south goes.
260;00:19:58,738;00:20:02,357;My future queen.
261;00:20:20,093;00:20:22,460;The prince does not wish
261;00:20:20,093;00:20:22,460;to be disturbed.
262;00:20:22,512;00:20:24,546;Remove yourself
262;00:20:22,512;00:20:24,546;from my path
263;00:20:24,581;00:20:26,464;Or i'll take that longaxe
263;00:20:24,581;00:20:26,464;and i'll shove it--
264;00:20:26,516;00:20:28,266;Captain.
265;00:20:29,553;00:20:31,386;Let her pass.
266;00:20:35,091;00:20:37,442;Your brother was murdered
267;00:20:37,477;00:20:39,561;And you sit here
267;00:20:37,477;00:20:39,561;in the water gardens
268;00:20:39,596;00:20:42,197;Staring at the sky
268;00:20:39,596;00:20:42,197;and doing nothing.
269;00:20:42,232;00:20:44,765;Oberyn was slain
269;00:20:42,232;00:20:44,765;during a trial by combat.
270;00:20:44,784;00:20:46,401;By law,
270;00:20:44,784;00:20:46,401;that is not murder.
271;00:20:46,436;00:20:48,987;Your brother.
271;00:20:46,436;00:20:48,987;You don't have
271;00:20:46,436;00:20:48,987;to remind me.
272;00:20:49,039;00:20:51,623;He was my brother long before
272;00:20:49,039;00:20:51,623;he was anything to you.
273;00:20:51,658;00:20:53,825;What will you do
273;00:20:51,658;00:20:53,825;about his death?
274;00:20:53,877;00:20:56,294;I will bury him.
274;00:20:53,877;00:20:56,294;I will mourn for him.
275;00:20:56,329;00:20:58,963;And then?
275;00:20:56,329;00:20:58,963;You would
275;00:20:56,329;00:20:58,963;have me go to war?
276;00:20:58,999;00:21:00,615;The whole country
276;00:20:58,999;00:21:00,615;would have you go to war.
277;00:21:00,634;00:21:03,635;Then we are lucky
277;00:21:00,634;00:21:03,635;the whole country
277;00:21:00,634;00:21:03,635;does not decide.
278;00:21:05,672;00:21:07,555;The sand snakes
278;00:21:05,672;00:21:07,555;are with me.
279;00:21:07,591;00:21:09,257;They have the love
279;00:21:07,591;00:21:09,257;of their people.
280;00:21:09,292;00:21:11,926;They will avenge
280;00:21:09,292;00:21:11,926;their father while
280;00:21:09,292;00:21:11,926;you sit here
281;00:21:11,961;00:21:14,896;In your chair
281;00:21:11,961;00:21:14,896;doing nothing.
282;00:21:18,652;00:21:20,318;Oberyn is dead
283;00:21:20,353;00:21:24,305;And this lannister girl skips
283;00:21:20,353;00:21:24,305;about the water gardens
284;00:21:24,324;00:21:28,326;Eating our food,
284;00:21:24,324;00:21:28,326;breathing our air.
285;00:21:28,361;00:21:31,496;How many of your
285;00:21:28,361;00:21:31,496;brothers and sisters
285;00:21:28,361;00:21:31,496;do they have to kill?
286;00:21:32,916;00:21:34,699;Let me have her.
287;00:21:36,169;00:21:40,171;Let me send her to cersei
287;00:21:36,169;00:21:40,171;one finger at a time.
288;00:21:41,625;00:21:43,925;I loved my brother.
289;00:21:43,960;00:21:45,993;And you made him
289;00:21:43,960;00:21:45,993;very happy.
290;00:21:46,012;00:21:49,180;For that, you will always
290;00:21:46,012;00:21:49,180;have a place in my heart.
291;00:21:50,717;00:21:54,435;But we do not
291;00:21:50,717;00:21:54,435;mutilate little girls
291;00:21:50,717;00:21:54,435;for vengeance.
292;00:21:54,471;00:21:56,221;Not here.
293;00:21:56,273;00:21:58,139;Not while i rule.
294;00:21:59,392;00:22:01,609;And how long
294;00:21:59,392;00:22:01,609;will that be?
295;00:22:17,460;00:22:19,694;The unsullied
295;00:22:17,460;00:22:19,694;are too conspicuous.
296;00:22:19,713;00:22:22,797;Anyone can see you coming
296;00:22:19,713;00:22:22,797;from a mile off.
297;00:22:22,832;00:22:25,049;Of course you haven't found
297;00:22:22,832;00:22:25,049;any sons of the harpy.
298;00:22:25,085;00:22:27,085;You haven't, have you?
299;00:22:28,588;00:22:31,756;My second sons,
299;00:22:28,588;00:22:31,756;on the other hand,

302;00:22:36,896;00:22:38,346;They blend in.
303;00:22:38,381;00:22:40,682;They overhear
303;00:22:38,381;00:22:40,682;things in taverns,
304;00:22:40,734;00:22:44,269;Follow people
304;00:22:40,734;00:22:44,269;from the taverns
304;00:22:40,734;00:22:44,269;to nice, quiet alleys,
305;00:22:44,321;00:22:46,487;Break a few fingers,
306;00:22:46,523;00:22:48,690;Overhear
306;00:22:46,523;00:22:48,690;a few more things.
307;00:22:49,826;00:22:51,659;Before you know it...
308;00:23:11,097;00:23:13,464;No one here.
309;00:23:13,516;00:23:15,016;We go.
310;00:23:15,051;00:23:17,935;In a hurry?
310;00:23:15,051;00:23:17,935;You're afraid?
311;00:23:18,021;00:23:19,937;Unsullied fear nothing.
312;00:23:19,973;00:23:21,939;Right.
313;00:23:21,975;00:23:23,775;That's your problem.
314;00:23:23,810;00:23:26,144;You understood fear
314;00:23:23,810;00:23:26,144;once long ago,
315;00:23:26,196;00:23:27,928;But you've forgotten
315;00:23:26,196;00:23:27,928;what it means.
316;00:23:27,947;00:23:31,699;Someone who's
316;00:23:27,947;00:23:31,699;forgotten fear
317;00:23:31,735;00:23:33,484;Has forgotten how to hide.
318;00:23:35,622;00:23:37,488;
319;00:23:42,078;00:23:44,495;Fear is useful
319;00:23:42,078;00:23:44,495;that way.
320;00:23:46,299;00:23:48,800;
321;00:24:08,571;00:24:12,473;Sons of the harpy,
321;00:24:08,571;00:24:12,473;they want to put a collar
321;00:24:08,571;00:24:12,473;back on my neck.
322;00:24:12,492;00:24:13,808;On all of our necks.
323;00:24:13,827;00:24:15,660;Please, your grace,
323;00:24:13,827;00:24:15,660;you must kill him.
324;00:24:15,695;00:24:16,994;It would send a message.
325;00:24:17,030;00:24:19,947;I think you should
325;00:24:17,030;00:24:19,947;exercise restraint,
325;00:24:17,030;00:24:19,947;your grace.
326;00:24:19,999;00:24:22,817;Why?
326;00:24:19,999;00:24:22,817;For one thing, he may have
326;00:24:19,999;00:24:22,817;valuable information.
327;00:24:22,836;00:24:25,820;The son of the harpy
327;00:24:22,836;00:24:25,820;has no more valuable
327;00:24:22,836;00:24:25,820;information.
328;00:24:25,839;00:24:27,121;How do you know that?
329;00:24:27,156;00:24:29,123;Because i questioned him.
330;00:24:29,158;00:24:31,209;And the information
330;00:24:29,158;00:24:31,209;you did get,
331;00:24:31,261;00:24:32,960;He is young and poor.
331;00:24:31,261;00:24:32,960;He is born free.
332;00:24:33,012;00:24:35,179;Why should he want
332;00:24:33,012;00:24:35,179;to bring back slavery?
332;00:24:33,012;00:24:35,179;What did it do for him?
333;00:24:35,215;00:24:36,931;Perhaps the only thing
333;00:24:35,215;00:24:36,931;that gave him pride
334;00:24:36,966;00:24:38,666;Was knowing
334;00:24:36,966;00:24:38,666;that there was someone
334;00:24:36,966;00:24:38,666;lower than he was.
335;00:24:38,685;00:24:40,134;They pay him.
336;00:24:40,169;00:24:41,769;Great families
336;00:24:40,169;00:24:41,769;afraid to do a thing.
337;00:24:41,805;00:24:43,938;They pay poor man
337;00:24:41,805;00:24:43,938;to do it for them.
338;00:24:43,973;00:24:45,556;And how do you know this?
338;00:24:43,973;00:24:45,556;Everyone know this.
339;00:24:45,642;00:24:47,525;I don't know it
339;00:24:45,642;00:24:47,525;and i'm the head
339;00:24:45,642;00:24:47,525;of a great family.
340;00:24:47,560;00:24:50,194;We do not know what
340;00:24:47,560;00:24:50,194;this man did or didn't do.
341;00:24:50,280;00:24:54,198;Give him a trial at least.
341;00:24:50,280;00:24:54,198;A fair trial.
342;00:24:54,234;00:24:56,183;Show all the citizens
342;00:24:54,234;00:24:56,183;of meereen
343;00:24:56,202;00:24:58,319;That you're better than
343;00:24:56,202;00:24:58,319;those who would depose you.
344;00:24:58,354;00:24:59,987;Teach them a better way.
345;00:25:00,022;00:25:02,490;I do not know
345;00:25:00,022;00:25:02,490;the place from where
345;00:25:00,022;00:25:02,490;old ser comes.
346;00:25:02,525;00:25:05,626;Things maybe are
346;00:25:02,525;00:25:05,626;different there, i hope.
347;00:25:05,662;00:25:07,829;But here in meereen,
348;00:25:07,864;00:25:10,698;Before daenerys stormborn,
348;00:25:07,864;00:25:10,698;they own us.
349;00:25:10,717;00:25:12,884;So we learn
349;00:25:10,717;00:25:12,884;much about them
350;00:25:12,919;00:25:15,253;Or we do not live long.
351;00:25:15,305;00:25:17,555;They teach me
351;00:25:15,305;00:25:17,555;what they are.
352;00:25:17,590;00:25:21,893;Mercy, fair trial--
352;00:25:17,590;00:25:21,893;these mean nothing to them.
353;00:25:21,928;00:25:24,395;All they understand
353;00:25:21,928;00:25:24,395;is blood.
354;00:25:29,068;00:25:31,519;Thank you all
354;00:25:29,068;00:25:31,519;for your counsel.

356;00:25:42,415;00:25:44,949;About what?
356;00:25:42,415;00:25:44,949;About your father.
357;00:25:45,001;00:25:47,368;About the mad king.
357;00:25:45,001;00:25:47,368;The mad king?
358;00:25:47,420;00:25:48,870;You're here to remind me
358;00:25:47,420;00:25:48,870;of my enemies' lies?
359;00:25:48,905;00:25:50,338;Consider me reminded.
360;00:25:50,373;00:25:54,208;Your grace, i served
360;00:25:50,373;00:25:54,208;in his kingsguard.
361;00:25:54,243;00:25:56,294;I was at his side
361;00:25:54,243;00:25:56,294;from the first.
362;00:25:56,346;00:25:58,963;Your enemies did not lie.
363;00:26:00,266;00:26:02,133;Go on.
364;00:26:03,636;00:26:06,521;When the people rose
364;00:26:03,636;00:26:06,521;in revolt against him,
365;00:26:06,556;00:26:09,924;Your father set their towns
365;00:26:06,556;00:26:09,924;and castles aflame.
366;00:26:09,943;00:26:13,444;He murdered sons
366;00:26:09,943;00:26:13,444;in front of their fathers.
367;00:26:13,480;00:26:15,646;He burned men alive
367;00:26:13,480;00:26:15,646;with wildfire
368;00:26:15,698;00:26:18,733;And laughed
368;00:26:15,698;00:26:18,733;as they screamed.
369;00:26:18,768;00:26:22,403;And his efforts
369;00:26:18,768;00:26:22,403;to stamp out dissent
370;00:26:22,438;00:26:26,824;Led to rebellion
370;00:26:22,438;00:26:26,824;that killed every

372;00:26:29,496;00:26:32,880;No, your grace.
372;00:26:29,496;00:26:32,880;Thank the gods.
373;00:26:32,916;00:26:37,134;But the mad king gave
373;00:26:32,916;00:26:37,134;his enemies the justice
373;00:26:32,916;00:26:37,134;he thought they deserved.
374;00:26:37,170;00:26:41,255;And each time,
374;00:26:37,170;00:26:41,255;it made him feel
374;00:26:37,170;00:26:41,255;powerful and right.
375;00:26:42,425;00:26:43,841;Until the very end.

381;00:27:09,085;00:27:10,501;Yes, best be careful.
382;00:27:10,537;00:27:13,004;You might accidently
382;00:27:10,537;00:27:13,004;consume some solid food.
383;00:27:13,039;00:27:15,206;When i agreed

385;00:27:22,265;00:27:25,466;Besides, what else
385;00:27:22,265;00:27:25,466;is there for me to do
386;00:27:25,501;00:27:27,351;Inside this fucking box?
387;00:27:27,387;00:27:29,303;You don't like it?
387;00:27:27,387;00:27:29,303;I want to take a walk.
388;00:27:29,355;00:27:30,471;You can't.
389;00:27:30,523;00:27:31,939;Cersei has offered
389;00:27:30,523;00:27:31,939;a lordship

391;00:27:34,193;00:27:36,143;She ought to offer
391;00:27:34,193;00:27:36,143;her cunt.
392;00:27:36,178;00:27:38,980;Best part of her
392;00:27:36,178;00:27:38,980;for the best part of me.
393;00:27:39,015;00:27:42,867;Well, i suppose a box
393;00:27:39,015;00:27:42,867;is as good a place
393;00:27:39,015;00:27:42,867;for me as anywhere.
394;00:27:42,902;00:27:46,037;Are we really going
394;00:27:42,902;00:27:46,037;to spend the entire

395;00:27:46,072;00:27:48,039;Talking about

396;00:27:48,074;00:27:50,157;You're right.
396;00:27:48,074;00:27:50,157;No point.
397;00:27:50,209;00:27:52,326;The road to volantis?
398;00:27:52,361;00:27:55,296;You said we were

398;00:27:52,361;00:27:55,296;What's in volantis?
399;00:27:55,331;00:27:56,797;The road to meereen.
400;00:27:56,833;00:28:00,301;And what do you hope
400;00:27:56,833;00:28:00,301;to find at the end of
400;00:27:56,833;00:28:00,301;the road to meereen?
401;00:28:00,336;00:28:02,536;I told you.
401;00:28:00,336;00:28:02,536;A ruler.
402;00:28:02,555;00:28:04,639;We've already got
402;00:28:02,555;00:28:04,639;a ruler.

403;00:28:04,674;00:28:07,341;got a ruler.
404;00:28:07,393;00:28:10,311;Every pile of shit
404;00:28:07,393;00:28:10,311;on the side of every road
405;00:28:10,346;00:28:12,212;Has someone's banner
405;00:28:10,346;00:28:12,212;hanging from it.
406;00:28:12,231;00:28:16,267;You were quite good,
406;00:28:12,231;00:28:16,267;you know, at ruling.
407;00:28:16,319;00:28:18,936;During your brief
407;00:28:16,319;00:28:18,936;tenure as hand.
408;00:28:18,988;00:28:20,905;I didn't rule.
408;00:28:18,988;00:28:20,905;I was a servant.
409;00:28:20,940;00:28:23,407;Still, a man of talent.
410;00:28:23,443;00:28:24,909;Managed to kill
410;00:28:23,443;00:28:24,909;a lot of people.
411;00:28:24,994;00:28:29,080;Yes, but you showed
411;00:28:24,994;00:28:29,080;great promise in other
411;00:28:24,994;00:28:29,080;areas as well.
412;00:28:32,168;00:28:35,119;She wanted me
412;00:28:32,168;00:28:35,119;to leave king's landing.
413;00:28:35,171;00:28:37,254;She begged me.
414;00:28:37,290;00:28:38,739;I wouldn't go.
415;00:28:38,758;00:28:40,291;Why?
416;00:28:40,343;00:28:42,460;'cause i liked it.
417;00:28:42,512;00:28:46,263;Power.
417;00:28:42,512;00:28:46,263;Even as a servant.
418;00:28:46,299;00:28:49,300;People follow leaders.
419;00:28:49,352;00:28:51,385;And they will never
419;00:28:49,352;00:28:51,385;follow us.
420;00:28:51,437;00:28:53,270;They find us repulsive.
421;00:28:53,306;00:28:54,772;I find us repulsive.
422;00:28:54,807;00:28:56,641;And we find them repulsive,
423;00:28:56,693;00:29:00,260;Which is why we surround
423;00:28:56,693;00:29:00,260;ourselves with large,
423;00:28:56,693;00:29:00,260;comfortable boxes
424;00:29:00,279;00:29:02,063;To keep them away.

427;00:29:06,619;00:29:10,821;inside the box.
428;00:29:10,873;00:29:13,324;Not for long.
429;00:29:13,376;00:29:15,376;You're right.
430;00:29:15,411;00:29:17,912;Let's go for a walk.
430;00:29:15,411;00:29:17,912;No.
431;00:29:17,947;00:29:20,998;How many dwarves
431;00:29:17,947;00:29:20,998;are there in the world?

437;00:29:34,097;00:29:35,963;That won't be necessary,

442;00:29:44,273;00:29:46,157;I would take it
442;00:29:44,273;00:29:46,157;if you don't mind.
443;00:29:46,192;00:29:48,943;It could prove useful
443;00:29:46,192;00:29:48,943;for my work.
444;00:29:48,978;00:29:50,611;Very good.
