281;00:17:39,776;00:17:41,477;You talk too much.
282;00:17:41,511;00:17:44,080;She won't talk so much
282;00:17:41,511;00:17:44,080;when she's choking on my cock.

285;00:17:49,620;00:17:52,655;that my cock can't reach?
286;00:17:52,689;00:17:55,291;She'll tell me whatever
286;00:17:52,689;00:17:55,291;you pay her to tell me.

290;00:18:04,735;00:18:07,036;and you sell your blade.

296;00:18:20,016;00:18:23,352;and the thrill of killing

297;00:18:23,386;00:18:24,887;You'll die young.

321;00:20:10,092;00:20:11,659;Oh, yes.
322;00:20:11,693;00:20:14,095;The husband of your dreams.
323;00:20:14,129;00:20:16,764;But you do look glorious.
324;00:20:21,770;00:20:23,771;Perhaps we could have
324;00:20:21,770;00:20:23,771;a moment alone.
325;00:20:23,805;00:20:25,440;Do you mind?
326;00:20:27,009;00:20:30,645;Podrick, could you escort

327;00:20:46,197;00:20:48,165;My lady,
328;00:20:48,200;00:20:50,734;I want you to know
329;00:20:50,768;00:20:53,103;I didn't ask for this.
330;00:20:53,137;00:20:55,839;I hope I will not
330;00:20:53,137;00:20:55,839;disappoint you, my lord.
331;00:20:55,873;00:20:57,574;No, don't.
332;00:20:57,608;00:21:00,544;You don't have to speak to me
332;00:20:57,608;00:21:00,544;as a prisoner anymore.
333;00:21:00,578;00:21:02,579;You won't be a prisoner
333;00:21:00,578;00:21:02,579;after today.
334;00:21:02,614;00:21:04,682;You'll be my wife.
335;00:21:04,717;00:21:09,087;I suppose that's a
335;00:21:04,717;00:21:09,087;different kind of prison.
336;00:21:10,857;00:21:12,758;I just wanted to say--
337;00:21:12,793;00:21:16,429;I'm just trying
337;00:21:12,793;00:21:16,429;to say very badly--
338;00:21:17,965;00:21:20,333;I just--
339;00:21:20,367;00:21:23,168;just want to say
339;00:21:20,367;00:21:23,168;I know how you feel.
340;00:21:25,204;00:21:28,406;I doubt that
340;00:21:25,204;00:21:28,406;very much, my lord.
341;00:21:30,376;00:21:31,876;You're right.
342;00:21:31,910;00:21:34,245;I have no idea how you feel.
343;00:21:34,279;00:21:36,547;And you have no idea
343;00:21:34,279;00:21:36,547;how I feel.
344;00:21:43,688;00:21:46,623;But I promise you
344;00:21:43,688;00:21:46,623;one thing, my lady.
345;00:21:47,926;00:21:50,327;I won't ever hurt you.
346;00:21:54,199;00:21:56,733;Do you drink wine?
347;00:21:56,768;00:21:59,303;When I have to.
348;00:21:59,337;00:22:02,573;Well, today you have to.
349;00:22:09,581;00:22:11,849;Margaery: You look

350;00:22:11,883;00:22:14,485;Radiant?
350;00:22:11,883;00:22:14,485;Why radiant?
351;00:22:14,519;00:22:16,354;It's the word
351;00:22:14,519;00:22:16,354;that came to mind.

353;00:22:18,424;00:22:20,425;We're going to be sisters soon.
354;00:22:20,459;00:22:22,861;We should be friends.

355;00:22:22,895;00:22:25,430;aren't you?
356;00:22:25,465;00:22:28,300;I imagine you have
356;00:22:25,465;00:22:28,300;a lovely voice.
357;00:22:28,334;00:22:31,270;A better dancer than a
357;00:22:28,334;00:22:31,270;singer, I'm afraid.
358;00:22:31,304;00:22:33,872;Ah, but you know the song
358;00:22:31,304;00:22:33,872;The Rains of Castamere?
359;00:22:33,907;00:22:37,410;Of course. They play it
359;00:22:33,907;00:22:37,410;so often here at court.
360;00:22:37,444;00:22:40,413;So you know the story
360;00:22:37,444;00:22:40,413;of House Reyne of Castamere?
361;00:22:40,447;00:22:42,915;Not as well as you, I'm sure.
362;00:22:42,949;00:22:45,083;House Reyne
362;00:22:42,949;00:22:45,083;was a powerful family.
363;00:22:45,118;00:22:46,518;Very wealthy.
364;00:22:46,552;00:22:49,087;The second wealthiest
364;00:22:46,552;00:22:49,087;in Westeros.
365;00:22:49,121;00:22:53,491;Aren't the Tyrells the second
365;00:22:49,121;00:22:53,491;wealthiest family in Westeros now?
366;00:22:53,526;00:22:55,960;Of course, ambitious
366;00:22:53,526;00:22:55,960;climbers don't want to stop
367;00:22:55,994;00:22:58,295;on the second highest rung.
368;00:22:58,329;00:23:01,164;If only you could take
368;00:22:58,329;00:23:01,164;that final step,
369;00:23:01,199;00:23:04,067;you'd see further
369;00:23:01,199;00:23:04,067;than all the rest.
370;00:23:04,102;00:23:07,070;You'd be alone with nothing
370;00:23:04,102;00:23:07,070;but blue sky above you.
371;00:23:08,072;00:23:10,040;So Lord Reyne built a castle
372;00:23:10,074;00:23:12,042;as grand as Casterly Rock.
373;00:23:12,076;00:23:13,644;He gave his wife diamonds
374;00:23:13,678;00:23:16,213;larger than any
374;00:23:13,678;00:23:16,213;my mother ever wore.
375;00:23:16,248;00:23:18,582;And finally one day,
376;00:23:18,617;00:23:20,951;he rebelled against my father.
377;00:23:20,986;00:23:23,654;Do you know where
377;00:23:20,986;00:23:23,654;House Reyne is now?
378;00:23:23,689;00:23:25,222;Gone.
379;00:23:25,257;00:23:27,524;Gone.
380;00:23:27,559;00:23:29,794;A gentle word.
381;00:23:29,828;00:23:32,329;Why not say slaughtered?
382;00:23:32,364;00:23:35,232;Every man, woman, and child
383;00:23:35,267;00:23:37,735;put to the sword.
384;00:23:37,769;00:23:39,804;I remember seeing
384;00:23:37,769;00:23:39,804;their bodies hanging
385;00:23:39,838;00:23:42,473;high above the gates
385;00:23:39,838;00:23:42,473;of Casterly Rock.
386;00:23:42,507;00:23:45,410;My father let them rot
386;00:23:42,507;00:23:45,410;up there all summer.
387;00:23:45,444;00:23:47,845;It was a long summer.
388;00:23:47,879;00:23:51,515;And now the rains
388;00:23:47,879;00:23:51,515;weep o'er their halls,
389;00:23:51,549;00:23:53,617;and not a soul to hear.
390;00:23:59,223;00:24:00,824;If you ever
390;00:23:59,223;00:24:00,824;call me sister again,
391;00:24:00,858;00:24:03,493;I'll have you strangled

396;00:24:41,866;00:24:45,268;it is my duty to give you

404;00:26:50,200;00:26:51,834;Thank you.

408;00:27:05,650;00:27:09,052;to witness the union
408;00:27:05,650;00:27:09,052;of man and wife.
409;00:27:09,087;00:27:12,956;One flesh, one heart, one soul,

411;00:27:32,776;00:27:35,210;Have you ever seen one like it?
412;00:27:35,244;00:27:38,179;I've never seen anything
412;00:27:35,244;00:27:38,179;like any of this.
413;00:27:38,213;00:27:39,880;Not in my life.
414;00:27:39,915;00:27:41,649;It's shocking, isn't it,
415;00:27:41,683;00:27:43,751;the first time
415;00:27:41,683;00:27:43,751;you encounter real wealth?
416;00:27:43,785;00:27:47,721;When I was your age, I lived
416;00:27:43,785;00:27:47,721;on one bowl of stew a day.
417;00:27:47,756;00:27:50,658;And stew is a kind word for it.
418;00:27:52,027;00:27:54,529;In Flea Bottom we called
418;00:27:52,027;00:27:54,529;them bowls of brown.
419;00:27:56,098;00:27:58,633;We'd pretend that the meat
419;00:27:56,098;00:27:58,633;in them was chicken.
420;00:27:59,735;00:28:01,770;We knew it wasn't chicken.
421;00:28:08,212;00:28:11,047;( liquid pouring )
422;00:28:13,584;00:28:16,519;Here, taste this.
423;00:28:16,554;00:28:19,089;You think I'm trying
423;00:28:16,554;00:28:19,089;to poison you?
424;00:28:41,309;00:28:42,777;That's good.
425;00:28:46,348;00:28:47,982;That's really good.
426;00:28:48,016;00:28:50,317;Where do you think it's from?
427;00:28:50,352;00:28:52,086;I couldn't even guess.
428;00:28:52,120;00:28:53,854;Doesn't matter, does it?
429;00:28:53,889;00:28:56,057;It's the real thing
429;00:28:53,889;00:28:56,057;or it's not.
430;00:28:56,091;00:28:59,260;You only need a tongue
430;00:28:56,091;00:28:59,260;to tell the difference.
431;00:29:01,430;00:29:03,631;Go on, have some more.
432;00:29:08,403;00:29:10,571;You still don't trust it.
433;00:29:10,605;00:29:12,173;You think this is all a mistake
434;00:29:12,207;00:29:14,909;and that you'll have to pay
434;00:29:12,207;00:29:14,909;somehow for every bite you take.
435;00:29:14,943;00:29:17,278;That thought had
435;00:29:14,943;00:29:17,278;crossed my mind, yeah.
436;00:29:19,081;00:29:21,415;There are no mistakes.
437;00:29:21,450;00:29:23,384;Not for us.
438;00:29:24,553;00:29:26,987;I'm a mistake.
439;00:29:27,022;00:29:29,223;I'm only here because
439;00:29:27,022;00:29:29,223;my father grabbed my mother
440;00:29:29,257;00:29:31,191;instead of the girl
440;00:29:29,257;00:29:31,191;next to her in the tavern.
441;00:29:31,226;00:29:34,928;Your father chose your mother because
441;00:29:31,226;00:29:34,928;the Lord of Light willed it.
442;00:29:34,962;00:29:37,731;He willed it so you
442;00:29:34,962;00:29:37,731;could be here right now
443;00:29:37,765;00:29:39,999;with a power inside you
444;00:29:40,034;00:29:43,035;you can't even begin
444;00:29:40,034;00:29:43,035;to understand.
445;00:29:45,339;00:29:48,141;And He brought me here
445;00:29:45,339;00:29:48,141;to draw it from you
446;00:29:48,176;00:29:50,143;and birth it into the world.
447;00:29:53,114;00:29:55,381;We're both a part of His plan.
448;00:29:56,383;00:29:58,050;He wants this for us.
449;00:29:58,085;00:30:00,920;No, He demands this of us.
450;00:30:04,725;00:30:07,260;I don't understand.
450;00:30:04,725;00:30:07,260;This--
451;00:30:07,294;00:30:09,095;this doesn't seem
451;00:30:07,294;00:30:09,095;very religious.
452;00:30:09,129;00:30:11,597;According to whom?
453;00:30:13,199;00:30:15,067;The Silent Sisters?
454;00:30:15,101;00:30:17,035;With their stern looks,
455;00:30:17,070;00:30:20,372;muzzled mouths,
455;00:30:17,070;00:30:20,372;and dried-up cunts?
456;00:30:21,841;00:30:24,342;What have their gods
456;00:30:21,841;00:30:24,342;done for you?
457;00:30:24,377;00:30:26,377;Hmm?
458;00:30:26,412;00:30:28,146;When you pray to them,
459;00:30:28,180;00:30:30,414;what's their answer?
460;00:30:30,449;00:30:33,017;A god is real or he's not.
461;00:30:34,252;00:30:36,887;You only need eyes to see.
462;00:30:41,258;00:30:44,561;Death is coming
462;00:30:41,258;00:30:44,561;for everyone and everything.
463;00:30:44,595;00:30:47,564;A darkness that will
463;00:30:44,595;00:30:47,564;swallow the dawn.
464;00:30:48,633;00:30:52,436;And we can stop it, you and I.

466;00:31:19,164;00:31:22,733;Let me show you
466;00:31:19,164;00:31:22,733;what you have inside you.
467;00:31:22,768;00:31:24,802;Come fight death with me.

469;00:31:54,468;00:31:56,235;What are you doing?
470;00:31:59,306;00:32:01,340;You have to trust me.
471;00:32:24,430;00:32:26,065;What--?
472;00:32:26,099;00:32:28,501;Get it away.
473;00:32:28,535;00:32:29,902;Get it off me.
474;00:32:29,937;00:32:32,705;Don't fight, don't fight.
474;00:32:29,937;00:32:32,705;They won't take much.
475;00:32:33,774;00:32:35,742;Why are you doing this?
476;00:32:36,978;00:32:39,746;I told you there's power
476;00:32:36,978;00:32:39,746;in the blood of kings.
477;00:32:39,781;00:32:41,749;And you have so much blood.
478;00:32:41,783;00:32:44,818;No. No, no, no, no!
479;00:32:46,621;00:32:49,023;Not there.
479;00:32:46,621;00:32:49,023;Not there!
480;00:32:54,262;00:32:56,663;You can blame Ser Davos.
481;00:32:56,698;00:32:59,332;He didn't believe in
481;00:32:56,698;00:32:59,332;the power of king's blood.
482;00:33:01,335;00:33:03,603;He wanted a demonstration.
483;00:33:03,638;00:33:06,807;Gendry: Please.
483;00:33:03,638;00:33:06,807;Please, Your Grace.
484;00:33:06,841;00:33:09,310;My lord!

490;00:34:17,510;00:34:21,646;So their son
490;00:34:17,510;00:34:21,646;will be your nephew.
491;00:34:21,680;00:34:24,282;After you're wed
491;00:34:21,680;00:34:24,282;to Cersei, of course.
492;00:34:25,518;00:34:28,621;And you will be

493;00:34:28,655;00:34:30,957;and brother-in-law.

503;00:35:20,038;00:35:23,874;Perhaps you could talk
503;00:35:20,038;00:35:23,874;to your bride-to-be instead.
504;00:35:26,811;00:35:29,012;I've got a lifetime for that.
505;00:35:40,358;00:35:42,226;Stay.
506;00:35:50,635;00:35:53,070;You seem rather drunk.
507;00:35:53,105;00:35:55,907;Rather less than I plan to be.
508;00:35:55,941;00:35:58,810;Isn't it a man's duty to be
508;00:35:55,941;00:35:58,810;drunk at his own wedding?

526;00:36:42,687;00:36:44,455;to make your father
