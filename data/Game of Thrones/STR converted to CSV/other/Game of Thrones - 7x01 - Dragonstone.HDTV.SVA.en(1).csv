1;00:00:29,120;00:00:32,911;You're wondering why
﻿1;00:00:29,120;00:00:32,911;I brought you all here.
2;00:00:32,912;00:00:36,370;After all, we just had a feast.
3;00:00:36,871;00:00:39,328;Since when does old Walder
4;00:00:39,329;00:00:42,328;give us two feasts
4;00:00:39,329;00:00:42,328;in a single fortnight?
5;00:00:44,829;00:00:47,787;Well, it's no good being
5;00:00:44,829;00:00:47,787;Lord of the Riverlands
6;00:00:47,788;00:00:50,161;if you can't celebrate
6;00:00:47,788;00:00:50,161;with your family.
7;00:00:50,162;00:00:51,662;That's what I say!
8;00:00:51,663;00:00:55,078;Yes!
9;00:00:58,954;00:01:02,828;I've gathered every Frey
9;00:00:58,954;00:01:02,828;who means a damn thing
10;00:01:02,829;00:01:08,161;so I can tell you my plans
10;00:01:02,829;00:01:08,161;for this great house
11;00:01:08,162;00:01:11,036;now that winter has come.
12;00:01:11,037;00:01:14,204;But first, a toast!
13;00:01:15,746;00:01:19,453;No more of that
13;00:01:15,746;00:01:19,453;Dornish horse piss!
14;00:01:19,454;00:01:22,411;This is the finest Arbor gold!
15;00:01:22,412;00:01:25,411;Proper wine for proper heroes!
16;00:01:30,579;00:01:32,787;Stand together!
17;00:01:32,788;00:01:35,037;Stand together!
18;00:01:43,788;00:01:45,203;Not you.
19;00:01:45,204;00:01:48,120;I'm not wasting good wine
19;00:01:45,204;00:01:48,120;on a damn woman.
20;00:01:51,788;00:01:56,161;Maybe I'm not
20;00:01:51,788;00:01:56,161;the most pleasant man.
21;00:01:56,162;00:01:59,578;I'll admit it.
21;00:01:56,162;00:01:59,578;But I'm proud of you lot.
22;00:01:59,579;00:02:02,703;You're my family,
22;00:01:59,579;00:02:02,703;the men who helped me
23;00:02:02,704;00:02:05,745;slaughter the Starks
23;00:02:02,704;00:02:05,745;at the Red Wedding.
24;00:02:05,746;00:02:09,869;Yes, yes.
25;00:02:09,870;00:02:12,537;Cheer.
26;00:02:12,538;00:02:15,869;Brave men, all of you.
27;00:02:15,870;00:02:19,453;Butchered a woman
27;00:02:15,870;00:02:19,453;pregnant with her babe.
28;00:02:20,254;00:02:24,986;Cut the throat
28;00:02:20,254;00:02:24,986;of a mother of five.
29;00:02:25,287;00:02:28,411;Slaughtered your guests
29;00:02:25,287;00:02:28,411;after inviting them
30;00:02:28,412;00:02:30,162;into your home.
31;00:02:31,829;00:02:37,453;But you didn't slaughter
31;00:02:31,829;00:02:37,453;every one of the Starks.
32;00:02:37,454;00:02:42,203;No, no, that was your mistake.
33;00:02:42,204;00:02:46,078;You should have ripped them
33;00:02:42,204;00:02:46,078;all out, root and stem.
34;00:02:52,621;00:02:54,953;Leave one wolf alive
35;00:02:54,954;00:02:57,621;and the sheep are never safe.
36;00:03:23,246;00:03:25,538;When people ask you
36;00:03:23,246;00:03:25,538;what happened here...
37;00:03:26,829;00:03:28,829;tell them the North remembers.
38;00:03:30,162;00:03:34,162;Tell them winter came
38;00:03:30,162;00:03:34,162;for House Frey.
39;00:07:56,579;00:07:58,370;You wildlings?
40;00:07:58,371;00:08:01,287;I'm Meera Reed,
40;00:07:58,371;00:08:01,287;daughter of Howland Reed.
41;00:08:03,329;00:08:04,787;This is Brandon Stark,
42;00:08:04,788;00:08:06,995;son of Ned Stark.
43;00:08:11,204;00:08:12,829;How do I know that's true?
44;00:08:15,995;00:08:19,328;You were at
44;00:08:15,995;00:08:19,328;the Fist of the First Men.
45;00:08:19,329;00:08:20,788;You were at Hardhome.
46;00:08:22,954;00:08:24,663;You've seen
46;00:08:22,954;00:08:24,663;the Army of the Dead.
47;00:08:26,538;00:08:27,912;You've seen the Night King.
48;00:08:28,995;00:08:30,995;He's coming for us.
49;00:08:32,120;00:08:33,329;For all of us.
50;00:08:41,329;00:08:43,078;Okay, come on.
51;00:08:43,079;00:08:45,162;Let's get them inside.
52;00:09:13,995;00:09:17,453;I want every northern
52;00:09:13,995;00:09:17,453;maester to scour their records
53;00:09:17,454;00:09:20,620;for any mention of dragonglass.
54;00:09:20,621;00:09:22,703;Dragonglass kills White Walkers.
55;00:09:22,704;00:09:25,370;It's more valuable
55;00:09:22,704;00:09:25,370;to us now than gold.
56;00:09:25,371;00:09:27,036;We need to find it,
56;00:09:25,371;00:09:27,036;we need to mine it,
57;00:09:27,037;00:09:28,746;we need to make weapons from it.
58;00:09:30,079;00:09:33,078;Everyone aged 10 to 60
59;00:09:33,079;00:09:36,328;will drill daily with spears,
59;00:09:33,079;00:09:36,328;pikes, bow and arrow.
60;00:09:36,329;00:09:39,537;It's about time we taught these
60;00:09:36,329;00:09:39,537;boys of summer how to fight.
61;00:09:39,538;00:09:41,828;Not just the boys.
62;00:09:41,829;00:09:44,328;We can't defend the North
63;00:09:44,329;00:09:46,495;if only half the population is fighting.
64;00:09:46,496;00:09:51,203;You expect me to put a spear
64;00:09:46,496;00:09:51,203;in my granddaughter's hand?
65;00:09:51,204;00:09:54,869;I don't plan on knitting by the
65;00:09:51,204;00:09:54,869;fire while men fight for me.
66;00:09:54,870;00:09:57,953;I might be small, Lord Glover,
66;00:09:54,870;00:09:57,953;and I might be a girl,
67;00:09:57,954;00:10:00,411;but I am every bit as much
67;00:09:57,954;00:10:00,411;a Northerner as you.
68;00:10:00,412;00:10:02,286;Indeed you are, my lady.
68;00:10:00,412;00:10:02,286;No one has questioned...
69;00:10:02,287;00:10:04,412;And I don't need your
69;00:10:02,287;00:10:04,412;permission to defend the North.
70;00:10:07,329;00:10:12,161;We'll begin training every man,
70;00:10:07,329;00:10:12,161;woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island.
71;00:10:12,162;00:10:14,245;Aye!
72;00:10:14,246;00:10:15,745;While we're
72;00:10:14,246;00:10:15,745;preparing for attack,
73;00:10:15,746;00:10:18,078;we need to shore up
73;00:10:15,746;00:10:18,078;our defenses.
74;00:10:18,079;00:10:21,578;The only thing standing between us and
74;00:10:18,079;00:10:21,578;the Army of the Dead is the Wall,
75;00:10:21,579;00:10:25,495;and the Wall hasn't been
75;00:10:21,579;00:10:25,495;properly manned in centuries.
76;00:10:25,496;00:10:27,912;I'm not the king
76;00:10:25,496;00:10:27,912;of the Free Folk.
77;00:10:29,454;00:10:31,787;But if we're going to survive
77;00:10:29,454;00:10:31,787;this winter together...
78;00:10:33,329;00:10:35,994;You want us to man
78;00:10:33,329;00:10:35,994;the castles for you?
79;00:10:35,995;00:10:37,578;Aye.
80;00:10:37,579;00:10:40,411;Last time we saw the Night
80;00:10:37,579;00:10:40,411;King was at Hardhome.
81;00:10:40,412;00:10:43,745;The closest castle to Hardhome
81;00:10:40,412;00:10:43,745;is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
82;00:10:43,746;00:10:45,286;Then that's where I'll go.
83;00:10:45,287;00:10:48,453;Looks like we're
83;00:10:45,287;00:10:48,453;the Night's Watch now.
84;00:10:50,829;00:10:52,328;If they breach the Wall,
85;00:10:52,329;00:10:53,869;the first two castles
85;00:10:52,329;00:10:53,869;in their path
86;00:10:53,870;00:10:56,411;are Last Hearth and Karhold.
87;00:10:56,412;00:11:00,078;The Umbers and the Karstarks
87;00:10:56,412;00:11:00,078;betrayed the North.
88;00:11:00,079;00:11:01,703;Their castles
88;00:11:00,079;00:11:01,703;should be torn down
89;00:11:01,704;00:11:03,453;with not a stone left standing.
90;00:11:03,454;00:11:06,036;The castles committed no crimes.
91;00:11:06,037;00:11:09,453;And we need every fortress
91;00:11:06,037;00:11:09,453;we have for the war to come.
92;00:11:09,454;00:11:12,787;We should give the Last Hearth
92;00:11:09,454;00:11:12,787;and Karhold to new families,
93;00:11:12,788;00:11:15,328;loyal families who supported
93;00:11:12,788;00:11:15,328;us against Ramsay.
94;00:11:15,329;00:11:18,537;Aye!
95;00:11:18,538;00:11:20,828;The Umbers and the Karstarks
96;00:11:20,829;00:11:23,328;have fought beside
96;00:11:20,829;00:11:23,328;the Starks for centuries.
97;00:11:23,329;00:11:25,939;They've kept faith for
97;00:11:23,329;00:11:25,939;generation after generation.
98;00:11:25,941;00:11:27,495;And then they broke faith.
99;00:11:27,496;00:11:30,578;I'm not going to strip these
99;00:11:27,496;00:11:30,578;families of their ancestral homes
100;00:11:30,579;00:11:33,161;because of the crimes
100;00:11:30,579;00:11:33,161;of a few reckless sons.
101;00:11:33,162;00:11:34,828;So there's no
101;00:11:33,162;00:11:34,828;punishment for treason
102;00:11:34,829;00:11:37,329;and no reward for loyalty?
103;00:11:42,496;00:11:45,161;The punishment
103;00:11:42,496;00:11:45,161;for treason is death.
104;00:11:45,162;00:11:47,994;Smalljon Umber died
104;00:11:45,162;00:11:47,994;on the field of battle.
105;00:11:47,995;00:11:50,828;Harald Karstark died
105;00:11:47,995;00:11:50,828;on the field of battle.
106;00:11:50,829;00:11:53,245;They died fighting for Ramsay.
107;00:11:53,246;00:11:54,828;Give the castles to the families
108;00:11:54,829;00:11:57,203;of the men who died
108;00:11:54,829;00:11:57,203;fighting for you.
109;00:12:10,412;00:12:13,329;When I was Lord Commander
109;00:12:10,412;00:12:13,329;of the Night's Watch...
110;00:12:14,829;00:12:17,161;I executed men who betrayed me.
111;00:12:17,162;00:12:21,411;I executed men who
111;00:12:17,162;00:12:21,411;refused to follow orders.
112;00:12:21,412;00:12:23,203;My father always said,
113;00:12:23,204;00:12:25,787;The man who passes the sentence
113;00:12:23,204;00:12:25,787;should swing the sword,
114;00:12:25,788;00:12:29,078;and I have tried
114;00:12:25,788;00:12:29,078;to live by those words.
115;00:12:29,079;00:12:32,537;But I will not punish a son
115;00:12:29,079;00:12:32,537;for his father's sins,
116;00:12:32,538;00:12:34,994;and I will not take
116;00:12:32,538;00:12:34,994;a family home away
117;00:12:34,995;00:12:38,370;from a family it has
117;00:12:34,995;00:12:38,370;belonged to for centuries.
118;00:12:38,371;00:12:40,953;That is my decision,
119;00:12:40,954;00:12:43,538;and my decision is final.
120;00:12:49,746;00:12:50,746;Ned Umber.
121;00:12:58,746;00:13:00,079;Alys Karstark.
122;00:13:15,037;00:13:16,911;For centuries,
122;00:13:15,037;00:13:16,911;our families fought
123;00:13:16,912;00:13:19,745;side by side on the battlefield.
124;00:13:19,746;00:13:24,745;I ask you to pledge your loyalty
124;00:13:19,746;00:13:24,745;once again to House Stark,
125;00:13:24,746;00:13:27,286;to serve as our bannermen
126;00:13:27,287;00:13:29,995;and come to our aid
126;00:13:27,287;00:13:29,995;whenever called upon.
127;00:13:38,788;00:13:39,912;Stand.
128;00:13:43,621;00:13:46,411;Yesterday's wars
128;00:13:43,621;00:13:46,411;don't matter anymore.
129;00:13:46,412;00:13:49,411;The North needs
129;00:13:46,412;00:13:49,411;to band together,
130;00:13:49,412;00:13:50,788;all the living north.
131;00:13:52,120;00:13:54,453;Will you stand beside me,
131;00:13:52,120;00:13:54,453;Ned and Alys,
132;00:13:54,454;00:13:56,703;now and always?
133;00:13:56,704;00:13:59,161;Now and always!
134;00:14:18,287;00:14:20,537;You are my sister,
134;00:14:18,287;00:14:20,537;but I am king now.
135;00:14:20,538;00:14:22,161;Will you start wearing a crown?
136;00:14:22,162;00:14:23,787;When you question my decisions
137;00:14:23,788;00:14:25,953;in front of the other lords
137;00:14:23,788;00:14:25,953;and ladies, you undermine me.
138;00:14:25,954;00:14:27,564;So I can't question
138;00:14:25,954;00:14:27,564;your decisions anymore?
139;00:14:27,566;00:14:28,662;Of course you can, but...
140;00:14:28,663;00:14:30,994;Joffrey never let anyone
140;00:14:28,663;00:14:30,994;question his authority.
141;00:14:30,995;00:14:32,995;You think he was a good king?
142;00:14:34,663;00:14:36,621;Do you think I'm Joffrey?
143;00:14:40,246;00:14:43,161;You're as far from Joffrey
143;00:14:40,246;00:14:43,161;as anyone I've ever met.
144;00:14:43,162;00:14:44,663;Thank you.
145;00:14:46,287;00:14:48,370;You're good at this, you know.
146;00:14:48,371;00:14:50,828;At what?
146;00:14:48,371;00:14:50,828;At ruling.
147;00:14:50,829;00:14:52,662;No.
148;00:14:52,663;00:14:53,663;You are.
149;00:14:54,704;00:14:56,162;You are.
150;00:14:57,579;00:14:59,953;They respect you,
150;00:14:57,579;00:14:59,953;they really do,
151;00:14:59,954;00:15:02,119;but you have to...
152;00:15:02,120;00:15:03,537;Why are you laughing?
153;00:15:03,538;00:15:05,703;What did father used to say?
154;00:15:05,704;00:15:09,036;Everything before the
154;00:15:05,704;00:15:09,036;word but is horse shit.
155;00:15:09,037;00:15:10,537;He never said that to me.
156;00:15:10,538;00:15:13,245;No. No, he never cursed
156;00:15:10,538;00:15:13,245;in front of his girls.
157;00:15:13,246;00:15:16,328;Because he was
157;00:15:13,246;00:15:16,328;trying to protect us.
158;00:15:16,329;00:15:19,328;He never wanted us to see
158;00:15:16,329;00:15:19,328;how dirty the world really is,
159;00:15:19,329;00:15:22,036;but Father couldn't protect
159;00:15:19,329;00:15:22,036;me and neither can you.
160;00:15:22,037;00:15:23,322;Stop trying.
161;00:15:23,323;00:15:24,745;All right, I'll stop
161;00:15:23,323;00:15:24,745;trying to protect you
162;00:15:24,746;00:15:26,119;and you stop trying
162;00:15:24,746;00:15:26,119;to undermine me.
163;00:15:26,120;00:15:28,329;I'm not trying to undermine you!
164;00:15:29,870;00:15:32,911;You have to be
164;00:15:29,870;00:15:32,911;smarter than Father.
165;00:15:32,912;00:15:35,578;You need to be
165;00:15:32,912;00:15:35,578;smarter than Robb.
166;00:15:35,579;00:15:38,703;I loved them, I miss them,
166;00:15:35,579;00:15:38,703;but they made stupid mistakes,
167;00:15:38,704;00:15:40,745;and they both
167;00:15:38,704;00:15:40,745;lost their heads for it.
168;00:15:40,746;00:15:42,953;And how should I be smarter?
169;00:15:42,954;00:15:44,412;By listening to you?
170;00:15:46,538;00:15:49,745;Would that be so terrible?
171;00:15:49,746;00:15:52,704;A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace.
172;00:16:01,704;00:16:04,745;Cersei of House Lannister,
172;00:16:01,704;00:16:04,745;First of Her Name,
173;00:16:04,746;00:16:06,662;Queen of the Andals
173;00:16:04,746;00:16:06,662;and the First Men,
174;00:16:06,663;00:16:08,286;Protector of
174;00:16:06,663;00:16:08,286;the Seven Kingdoms...
175;00:16:08,287;00:16:09,746;What does she want?
176;00:16:10,995;00:16:13,787;Come to King's Landing.
177;00:16:13,788;00:16:17,620;Bend the knee or suffer
177;00:16:13,788;00:16:17,620;the fate of all traitors.
178;00:16:17,621;00:16:19,745;You've been so consumed
178;00:16:17,621;00:16:19,745;with the enemy to the north,
179;00:16:19,746;00:16:21,578;you've forgotten about
179;00:16:19,746;00:16:21,578;the one to the south.
180;00:16:21,579;00:16:24,620;I'm consumed with the Night
180;00:16:21,579;00:16:24,620;King because I've seen him.
181;00:16:24,621;00:16:27,245;And believe me, you'd think
181;00:16:24,621;00:16:27,245;of little else if you had, too.
182;00:16:27,246;00:16:28,953;We still have a wall between
182;00:16:27,246;00:16:28,953;us and the Night King.
183;00:16:28,954;00:16:30,787;There's nothing
183;00:16:28,954;00:16:30,787;between us and Cersei.
184;00:16:30,788;00:16:33,703;There's a thousand miles
184;00:16:30,788;00:16:33,703;between us and Cersei.
185;00:16:33,704;00:16:36,495;Winter is here. The Lannisters
185;00:16:33,704;00:16:36,495;are a southern army.
186;00:16:36,496;00:16:37,953;They've never ranged
186;00:16:36,496;00:16:37,953;this far north.
187;00:16:37,954;00:16:41,286;You're the military man,
187;00:16:37,954;00:16:41,286;but I know her.
188;00:16:41,287;00:16:44,620;If you're her enemy, she'll never
188;00:16:41,287;00:16:44,620;stop until she's destroyed you.
189;00:16:44,621;00:16:47,788;Everyone who's ever crossed her,
189;00:16:44,621;00:16:47,788;she's found a way to murder.
190;00:16:50,870;00:16:52,954;You almost sound
190;00:16:50,870;00:16:52,954;as if you admire her.
191;00:16:56,579;00:16:58,788;I learned a great deal from her.
192;00:17:35,663;00:17:37,495;What is this?
193;00:17:37,496;00:17:40,161;It's what we've been
193;00:17:37,496;00:17:40,161;waiting for our whole lives.
194;00:17:40,162;00:17:42,953;It's what Father trained us for,
194;00:17:40,162;00:17:42,953;whether he knew it or not.
195;00:17:42,954;00:17:44,453;He knew it.
196;00:17:44,454;00:17:46,411;Made me memorize
196;00:17:44,454;00:17:46,411;every damn city, town,
197;00:17:46,412;00:17:47,994;lake, forest, and mountain.
198;00:17:47,995;00:17:50,162;It's ours now.
198;00:17:47,995;00:17:50,162;We just have to take it.
199;00:17:51,704;00:17:54,036;You've been quiet
199;00:17:51,704;00:17:54,036;since you came home.
200;00:17:54,037;00:17:55,495;Are you angry with me?
201;00:17:55,496;00:17:57,746;No, not angry.
202;00:17:58,870;00:17:59,870;Are you afraid of me?
203;00:18:01,870;00:18:02,995;Should I be?
204;00:18:06,788;00:18:10,703;Daenerys Targaryen has chosen
204;00:18:06,788;00:18:10,703;Tyrion to be her Hand.
205;00:18:10,704;00:18:13,495;Right now, they're sailing
205;00:18:10,704;00:18:13,495;across the Narrow Sea,
206;00:18:13,496;00:18:16,495;hoping to take back
206;00:18:13,496;00:18:16,495;her father's throne.
207;00:18:16,496;00:18:18,911;Our little brother,
208;00:18:18,912;00:18:21,078;the one you love so much,
209;00:18:21,079;00:18:22,911;the one you set free,
210;00:18:22,912;00:18:26,203;the one who murdered our
210;00:18:22,912;00:18:26,203;father and our first-born son,
211;00:18:26,204;00:18:29,538;now he stands beside our enemies
211;00:18:26,204;00:18:29,538;and gives them counsel.
212;00:18:33,246;00:18:37,245;He's out there somewhere
212;00:18:33,246;00:18:37,245;at the head of an armada.
213;00:18:37,246;00:18:38,954;Where will they land?
214;00:18:41,746;00:18:43,078;Dragonstone.
215;00:18:43,079;00:18:45,869;They have deep-water
215;00:18:43,079;00:18:45,869;ports for the ships.
216;00:18:45,870;00:18:47,869;Stannis left
216;00:18:45,870;00:18:47,869;the castle unoccupied,
217;00:18:47,870;00:18:49,328;and that's where she was born.
218;00:18:49,329;00:18:51,620;Enemies to the east.
219;00:18:51,621;00:18:53,411;Enemies to the south...
220;00:18:53,412;00:18:56,411;Ellaria Sand
220;00:18:53,412;00:18:56,411;and her brood of bitches.
221;00:18:56,412;00:18:58,245;Enemies to the west...
222;00:18:58,246;00:19:00,078;Olenna, the old ***.
223;00:19:00,079;00:19:03,286;Another traitor.
224;00:19:03,287;00:19:05,453;Enemies to the north.
225;00:19:05,454;00:19:08,578;Ned Stark's bastard has been
225;00:19:05,454;00:19:08,578;named King in the North
226;00:19:08,579;00:19:11,578;and that murdering ***
226;00:19:08,579;00:19:11,578;Sansa stands beside him.
227;00:19:11,579;00:19:14,245;Enemies everywhere.
227;00:19:11,579;00:19:14,245;We're surrounded by traitors.
228;00:19:14,246;00:19:15,953;You're in command
228;00:19:14,246;00:19:15,953;of the Lannister army now.
229;00:19:15,954;00:19:19,078;How do we proceed?
229;00:19:15,954;00:19:19,078;Winter is here.
230;00:19:19,079;00:19:22,370;We can't win a war if we can't
230;00:19:19,079;00:19:22,370;feed our men and our horses.
231;00:19:22,371;00:19:26,537;The Tyrells have the grain,
231;00:19:22,371;00:19:26,537;the Tyrells have the livestock.
232;00:19:26,538;00:19:28,578;Will the Tyrell bannermen
232;00:19:26,538;00:19:28,578;stand alongside
233;00:19:28,579;00:19:31,869;a Dothraki horde
233;00:19:28,579;00:19:31,869;and Unsullied slave soldiers?
234;00:19:31,870;00:19:34,537;If they think Daenerys will win.
235;00:19:34,538;00:19:36,495;No one wants to fight
235;00:19:34,538;00:19:36,495;on the losing side.
236;00:19:36,496;00:19:39,621;Right now, we look like the losing side.
237;00:19:40,912;00:19:42,745;I'm the Queen
237;00:19:40,912;00:19:42,745;of the Seven Kingdoms.
238;00:19:42,746;00:19:45,495;Three kingdoms, at best.
239;00:19:45,496;00:19:48,036;I'm not sure you understand
239;00:19:45,496;00:19:48,036;how much danger we're in.
240;00:19:48,037;00:19:49,828;I understand we're
240;00:19:48,037;00:19:49,828;in a war for survival.
241;00:19:49,829;00:19:52,869;I understand whoever loses dies.
242;00:19:52,870;00:19:55,161;I understand whoever wins
242;00:19:52,870;00:19:55,161;could launch a dynasty
243;00:19:55,162;00:19:56,745;that lasts a thousand years.
244;00:19:56,746;00:19:59,328;A dynasty for whom?
245;00:19:59,329;00:20:02,328;Our children are dead.
246;00:20:02,329;00:20:03,787;We're the last of us.
247;00:20:03,788;00:20:05,829;A dynasty for us, then.
248;00:20:08,995;00:20:10,538;We never talked about Tommen.
249;00:20:13,538;00:20:15,495;There's nothing to say.
250;00:20:15,496;00:20:17,453;Our baby boy killed himself.
251;00:20:17,454;00:20:18,994;He betrayed me.
252;00:20:18,995;00:20:20,495;He betrayed us both.
253;00:20:20,496;00:20:22,328;Should we spend our days
253;00:20:20,496;00:20:22,328;mourning the dead...
254;00:20:22,329;00:20:23,745;Mother, father,
254;00:20:22,329;00:20:23,745;and all our children?
255;00:20:23,746;00:20:26,328;Cersei...
255;00:20:23,746;00:20:26,328;I loved them. I did.
256;00:20:26,329;00:20:29,537;But they're ashes now and
256;00:20:26,329;00:20:29,537;we're still flesh and blood.
257;00:20:29,538;00:20:32,538;We're the last Lannisters,
257;00:20:29,538;00:20:32,538;the last ones who count.
258;00:20:38,371;00:20:41,036;Even Lannisters can't
258;00:20:38,371;00:20:41,036;survive without allies.
259;00:20:41,037;00:20:44,203;Where are our allies now?
260;00:20:44,204;00:20:46,411;You saw what happened to
260;00:20:44,204;00:20:46,411;Walder Frey and his family.
261;00:20:46,412;00:20:48,078;I heard.
262;00:20:48,079;00:20:50,620;How could we ever trust a man like that?
262;00:20:48,079;00:20:50,620;We couldn't.
263;00:20:50,621;00:20:52,620;He was a useless, old coward,
264;00:20:52,621;00:20:54,453;but the Freys supported us.
265;00:20:54,454;00:20:55,828;Now they're all dead.
266;00:20:55,829;00:20:57,537;Whoever killed them
266;00:20:55,829;00:20:57,537;is no friend of ours.
267;00:20:57,538;00:20:59,078;We need allies.
268;00:20:59,079;00:21:00,869;Stronger, better allies.
269;00:21:00,870;00:21:02,995;We can't win this war alone.
270;00:21:04,995;00:21:08,621;You think I listened to Father for
270;00:21:04,995;00:21:08,621;40 years and learned nothing?
271;00:21:45,621;00:21:47,119;The Greyjoys?
272;00:21:47,120;00:21:49,703;You invited the Greyjoys
272;00:21:47,120;00:21:49,703;to King's Landing?
273;00:21:49,704;00:21:52,537;Not all of them.
273;00:21:49,704;00:21:52,537;Well, it looks like all of them.
274;00:21:52,538;00:21:54,119;I invited Euron Greyjoy,
275;00:21:54,120;00:21:56,620;the new King
275;00:21:54,120;00:21:56,620;of the Iron Islands.
276;00:21:56,621;00:21:59,328;You said yourself we needed
276;00:21:56,621;00:21:59,328;stronger, better allies.
277;00:21:59,329;00:22:02,453;There you are.
277;00:21:59,329;00:22:02,453;How are they better allies?
278;00:22:02,454;00:22:04,869;How are they different
278;00:22:02,454;00:22:04,869;from the Freys?
279;00:22:04,870;00:22:06,453;They both broke their promises
280;00:22:06,454;00:22:08,745;and murdered their former friends
280;00:22:06,454;00:22:08,745;as soon as it suited them.
281;00:22:08,746;00:22:11,745;So does everyone
281;00:22:08,746;00:22:11,745;when it suits them.
282;00:22:11,746;00:22:14,370;Unlike the Freys,
282;00:22:11,746;00:22:14,370;they have ships.
283;00:22:14,371;00:22:16,994;And they're good at killing.
283;00:22:14,371;00:22:16,994;They're not good at anything.
284;00:22:16,995;00:22:20,411;I know the Ironborn. They're
284;00:22:16,995;00:22:20,411;bitter, angry little people.
285;00:22:20,412;00:22:23,620;All they know how to do is steal things
285;00:22:20,412;00:22:23,620;they can't build or grow themselves.
286;00:22:23,621;00:22:25,745;Euron Greyjoy didn't
286;00:22:23,621;00:22:25,745;come here for that.
287;00:22:25,746;00:22:27,787;Oh, what did
287;00:22:25,746;00:22:27,787;he come here for, then?
288;00:22:27,788;00:22:29,454;A queen.
289;00:22:42,162;00:22:45,370;The moment I was chosen
289;00:22:42,162;00:22:45,370;Lord of the Iron Islands,
290;00:22:45,371;00:22:47,745;they turned on me.
291;00:22:47,746;00:22:48,994;Their own uncle.
292;00:22:48,995;00:22:51,620;They stole
292;00:22:48,995;00:22:51,620;my best ships and ran.
293;00:22:51,621;00:22:53,787;Sailed them
293;00:22:51,621;00:22:53,787;right across the world
294;00:22:53,788;00:22:56,078;and gave them
294;00:22:53,788;00:22:56,078;to the Dragon Queen
295;00:22:56,079;00:22:59,537;so she could bring her
295;00:22:56,079;00:22:59,537;armies here to attack you.
296;00:22:59,538;00:23:02,994;It's nothing compared
296;00:22:59,538;00:23:02,994;to the treason you suffered
297;00:23:02,995;00:23:06,662;at the hands of a family
297;00:23:02,995;00:23:06,662;member, from what I hear.
298;00:23:06,663;00:23:09,371;But still, it bothers me.
299;00:23:10,995;00:23:14,036;Murdering them would
299;00:23:10,995;00:23:14,036;make me feel a lot better.
300;00:23:14,037;00:23:18,203;And since it appears that all
300;00:23:14,037;00:23:18,203;our treasonous family members
301;00:23:18,204;00:23:20,119;are fighting for the same side,
302;00:23:20,120;00:23:22,662;I thought we rightful monarchs
303;00:23:22,663;00:23:25,246;could murder them together.
304;00:23:31,246;00:23:34,037;You're not a rightful
304;00:23:31,246;00:23:34,037;monarch, though, are you?
305;00:23:38,162;00:23:41,161;The Greyjoys rebelled against the
305;00:23:38,162;00:23:41,161;throne for the right to be monarchs,
306;00:23:41,162;00:23:45,203;but as I recall,
306;00:23:41,162;00:23:45,203;you were soundly defeated.
307;00:23:45,204;00:23:47,036;Come to mention it,
308;00:23:47,037;00:23:49,411;weren't you the one
308;00:23:47,037;00:23:49,411;who started that rebellion
309;00:23:49,412;00:23:53,620;by sailing to Casterly Rock
309;00:23:49,412;00:23:53,620;and burning the Lannister fleet?
310;00:23:53,621;00:23:55,328;You certainly caught us there.
311;00:23:55,329;00:23:58,161;Very smart move on your part.
312;00:23:58,162;00:24:02,411;Of course, we all made it
312;00:23:58,162;00:24:02,411;to the Iron Islands anyway.
313;00:24:02,412;00:24:03,620;I was there.
314;00:24:03,621;00:24:05,453;I remember very well.
315;00:24:05,454;00:24:06,994;I saw you.
316;00:24:06,995;00:24:09,286;I heard so much talk.
317;00:24:09,287;00:24:12,911;The best in the world.
317;00:24:09,287;00:24:12,911;No one can stop him.
318;00:24:12,912;00:24:14,620;I didn't believe it,
318;00:24:12,912;00:24:14,620;to be honest.
319;00:24:14,621;00:24:17,911;But I must say when you
319;00:24:14,621;00:24:17,911;rushed through the breach
320;00:24:17,912;00:24:20,079;and started
320;00:24:17,912;00:24:20,079;cutting people down...
321;00:24:23,579;00:24:25,286;it was glorious.
322;00:24:25,287;00:24:26,703;Like a dance.
323;00:24:26,704;00:24:29,911;The people I was cutting
323;00:24:26,704;00:24:29,911;down were your own kin.
324;00:24:29,912;00:24:32,245;The place was getting crowded.
325;00:24:32,246;00:24:34,828;I enjoyed watching it.
325;00:24:32,246;00:24:34,828;I truly did.
326;00:24:34,829;00:24:37,036;And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
327;00:24:37,037;00:24:39,495;A good thing for me.
328;00:24:39,496;00:24:43,119;If you hadn't crushed us, I
328;00:24:39,496;00:24:43,119;wouldn't have gone into exile.
329;00:24:43,120;00:24:45,036;If I hadn't done that,
330;00:24:45,037;00:24:48,621;I wouldn't be the greatest
330;00:24:45,037;00:24:48,621;captain on the 14 seas.
331;00:24:49,663;00:24:51,496;If not the most humble.
332;00:24:52,788;00:24:53,788;You're not humble.
333;00:24:55,746;00:24:57,746;You're the queen
333;00:24:55,746;00:24:57,746;of a great nation.
334;00:24:59,037;00:25:00,703;You don't care about
334;00:24:59,037;00:25:00,703;the Iron Islands.
335;00:25:00,704;00:25:05,370;They're nothing but rocks
335;00:25:00,704;00:25:05,370;and bird shit and...
336;00:25:05,371;00:25:08,245;And a lot of very
336;00:25:05,371;00:25:08,245;unattractive people.
337;00:25:08,246;00:25:10,869;The Iron Fleet,
337;00:25:08,246;00:25:10,869;on the other hand,
338;00:25:10,870;00:25:13,994;that's something else entirely.
339;00:25:13,995;00:25:17,286;It's the greatest armada
339;00:25:13,995;00:25:17,286;Westeros has ever seen.
340;00:25:17,287;00:25:21,869;With the Iron Fleet,
340;00:25:17,287;00:25:21,869;you own the seas.
341;00:25:21,870;00:25:24,703;You can defeat
341;00:25:21,870;00:25:24,703;the invaders of the east
342;00:25:24,704;00:25:27,662;and the pretenders
342;00:25:24,704;00:25:27,662;of the north and south.
343;00:25:27,663;00:25:29,287;What do you want in return?
344;00:25:31,371;00:25:34,411;Ever since I was a little boy,
345;00:25:34,412;00:25:36,328;I wanted to grow up and marry
346;00:25:36,329;00:25:38,453;the most beautiful woman
346;00:25:36,329;00:25:38,453;in the world.
347;00:25:38,454;00:25:41,161;So here I am,
348;00:25:41,162;00:25:43,620;with a thousand ships
349;00:25:43,621;00:25:45,162;and two good hands.
350;00:25:50,579;00:25:52,162;I decline your proposal.
351;00:25:54,663;00:25:55,703;Why?
352;00:25:55,704;00:25:57,371;You're not trustworthy.
353;00:25:58,788;00:26:00,869;You've broken promises
353;00:25:58,788;00:26:00,869;to allies before
354;00:26:00,870;00:26:03,328;and murdered them
354;00:26:00,870;00:26:03,328;at the nearest opportunity.
355;00:26:03,329;00:26:04,870;You murdered your own brother.
356;00:26:06,204;00:26:08,537;You should try it.
356;00:26:06,204;00:26:08,537;Feels wonderful.
357;00:26:10,162;00:26:12,203;I don't expect you
357;00:26:10,162;00:26:12,203;to trust me outright.
358;00:26:12,204;00:26:14,578;You need proof
358;00:26:12,204;00:26:14,578;of my honest intentions.
359;00:26:14,579;00:26:16,036;In my experience,
360;00:26:16,037;00:26:19,036;the surest way to a woman's
360;00:26:16,037;00:26:19,036;heart is with a gift.
361;00:26:19,037;00:26:21,328;A priceless gift.
362;00:26:21,329;00:26:23,203;I won't return to King's Landing
363;00:26:23,204;00:26:25,246;until I have that for you.
364;00:29:31,246;00:29:34,078;Ah, Maester Weyland.
365;00:29:34,079;00:29:37,579;A drinker's
365;00:29:34,079;00:29:37,579;liver if ever I saw one.
366;00:29:38,829;00:29:39,829;Weigh that.
367;00:29:40,995;00:29:44,286;The triumph
367;00:29:40,995;00:29:44,286;of transitory pleasures.
368;00:29:44,287;00:29:46,203;Mankind's curse.
369;00:29:46,204;00:29:49,286;Archmaester, I was wondering...
370;00:29:49,287;00:29:51,245;What's the weight?
371;00:29:51,246;00:29:54,204;Um, 147.
372;00:29:57,120;00:30:00,203;I was wondering if you had
372;00:29:57,120;00:30:00,203;considered my proposition.
373;00:30:00,204;00:30:03,286;I don't remember
373;00:30:00,204;00:30:03,286;your proposition.
374;00:30:03,287;00:30:06,578;I asked you if, in light of
374;00:30:03,287;00:30:06,578;what I've seen in the North,
375;00:30:06,579;00:30:09,745;if I could have access to the
375;00:30:06,579;00:30:09,745;restricted area of the library.
376;00:30:09,746;00:30:11,453;That area is reserved
376;00:30:09,746;00:30:11,453;for maesters.
377;00:30:11,454;00:30:13,953;Are you a maester?
377;00:30:11,454;00:30:13,953;No.
378;00:30:13,954;00:30:16,079;Not a very strong
378;00:30:13,954;00:30:16,079;proposition, is it?
379;00:30:25,371;00:30:28,036;Archmaester, with respect,
380;00:30:28,337;00:30:29,869;I've seen them...
381;00:30:29,870;00:30:32,119;The Army of the Dead.
382;00:30:32,120;00:30:34,495;The White Walkers.
383;00:30:35,196;00:30:36,994;I was sent here to learn
383;00:30:35,196;00:30:36,994;how to defeat them,
384;00:30:36,995;00:30:39,537;but everyone in the Citadel,
385;00:30:39,538;00:30:41,703;those who will even talk to me,
386;00:30:41,704;00:30:44,537;they all doubt the Walkers ever
386;00:30:41,704;00:30:44,537;existed in the first place.
387;00:30:44,538;00:30:47,078;Everyone in the Citadel
387;00:30:44,538;00:30:47,078;doubts everything.
388;00:30:47,079;00:30:48,162;It's their job.
389;00:30:53,704;00:30:56,995;But the tales of the Long Night
389;00:30:53,704;00:30:56,995;can't be pure fabrication.
390;00:30:58,829;00:31:01,745;Too many similarities
390;00:30:58,829;00:31:01,745;from unconnected sources.
391;00:31:01,746;00:31:04,328;Sources in the restricted area?
392;00:31:04,329;00:31:05,954;The very same.
393;00:31:07,246;00:31:08,703;And the simplest explanation
394;00:31:08,704;00:31:11,662;for your grating obsession
394;00:31:08,704;00:31:11,662;with the White Walkers
395;00:31:11,663;00:31:13,161;is that you're telling the truth
396;00:31:13,162;00:31:16,286;and that you saw
396;00:31:13,162;00:31:16,286;what you say you saw.
397;00:31:16,287;00:31:19,362;So, you believe me.
398;00:31:20,329;00:31:21,994;I do.
399;00:31:22,295;00:31:24,004;You'll finish
399;00:31:22,295;00:31:24,004;weighing that heart?
400;00:31:25,995;00:31:28,829;That makes you the only person
400;00:31:25,995;00:31:28,829;south of the Twins who does.
401;00:31:31,870;00:31:34,703;We're not like the people
401;00:31:31,870;00:31:34,703;south of the Twins.
402;00:31:34,704;00:31:36,912;And we're not like the
402;00:31:34,704;00:31:36,912;people north of the Twins.
403;00:31:39,246;00:31:43,162;In the Citadel, we lead different
403;00:31:39,246;00:31:43,162;lives for different reasons.

407;00:31:52,954;00:31:55,620;to any but the next.
408;00:31:55,621;00:31:57,787;And every time you leave the

409;00:31:57,788;00:32:00,703;you're gone forever.
410;00:32:00,704;00:32:03,703;When Robert's Rebellion

411;00:32:03,704;00:32:05,537;people thought the end was near.
412;00:32:05,538;00:32:08,620;The end of the Targaryen dynasty.
412;00:32:05,538;00:32:08,620;How will we survive?
413;00:32:08,621;00:32:12,078;When Aegon Targaryen
413;00:32:08,621;00:32:12,078;turned his eye westward

415;00:32:14,037;00:32:16,078;The end is near!

417;00:32:18,954;00:32:21,078;thinking it truly was the end.
418;00:32:21,079;00:32:23,788;But it wasn't.
418;00:32:21,079;00:32:23,788;None of it was.
419;00:32:25,579;00:32:28,120;The Wall has stood through it all.
420;00:32:29,412;00:32:32,371;And every winter

433;00:34:37,454;00:34:39,246;What about happy?
434;00:34:41,912;00:34:43,745;Why aren't you happy?

500;00:38:45,870;00:38:48,828;Girls take care of their papas
500;00:38:45,870;00:38:48,828;when their papas grow old.

507;00:39:29,663;00:39:31,663;I'm going to kill the queen.

517;00:40:20,912;00:40:23,037;Experience.
518;00:40:27,204;00:40:29,496;This seems like a good

529;00:41:16,329;00:41:18,162;Maybe they've got
529;00:41:16,329;00:41:18,162;some ale hidden away.
530;00:41:19,829;00:41:21,286;They don't.
531;00:41:24,204;00:41:25,869;See if there's a larder.
532;00:41:25,870;00:41:27,579;They always leave
532;00:41:25,870;00:41:27,579;something behind.
533;00:42:09,246;00:42:10,606;How do you think
533;00:42:09,246;00:42:10,606;it ended for them?
534;00:42:12,162;00:42:13,370;With death.
535;00:42:13,371;00:42:16,328;Girl died in her father's arms.
536;00:42:16,329;00:42:19,162;Both of them covered in blood
536;00:42:16,329;00:42:19,162;and a knife at their feet.
537;00:42:21,663;00:42:23,286;I'd say they were starving.
538;00:42:23,287;00:42:25,203;And rather than
538;00:42:23,287;00:42:25,203;let his little girl suffer,
539;00:42:25,204;00:42:27,161;he ended it for both of them.
540;00:42:27,162;00:42:29,411;Doesn't matter now.
541;00:42:29,412;00:42:32,204;No, doesn't matter now.
542;00:42:45,954;00:42:48,370;I've known you
542;00:42:45,954;00:42:48,370;a long time, Dondarrion.
543;00:42:48,371;00:42:49,869;Aye.
544;00:42:49,870;00:42:53,953;I think the first time we met
544;00:42:49,870;00:42:53,953;was at that tournament...
545;00:42:53,954;00:42:57,203;And I always thought
545;00:42:53,954;00:42:57,203;you were dull as dirt.
546;00:42:58,538;00:43:00,286;You're not bad.
547;00:43:00,287;00:43:01,662;I don't hate you.
548;00:43:01,663;00:43:04,036;Don't like you,
548;00:43:01,663;00:43:04,036;but you're not bad.
549;00:43:04,037;00:43:05,869;Thank you, Clegane.
550;00:43:05,870;00:43:07,203;That warms the heart.
551;00:43:07,204;00:43:09,869;But there's nothing
551;00:43:07,204;00:43:09,869;special about you.
552;00:43:10,670;00:43:11,703;You're right about that.
553;00:43:11,704;00:43:15,162;So why does the Lord of Light
553;00:43:11,704;00:43:15,162;keep bringing you back?
554;00:43:16,454;00:43:18,537;I've met better men than you,
555;00:43:18,538;00:43:23,453;and they've been hanged from
555;00:43:18,538;00:43:23,453;crossbeams, or beheaded,
556;00:43:23,454;00:43:28,328;or just shat themselves to
556;00:43:23,454;00:43:28,328;death in a field somewhere.
557;00:43:28,329;00:43:31,411;None of them came back.
558;00:43:31,412;00:43:32,994;So, why you?
559;00:43:32,995;00:43:35,911;You think I don't
559;00:43:32,995;00:43:35,911;ask myself that?
560;00:43:35,912;00:43:39,078;Every hour of every day?
561;00:43:39,079;00:43:40,746;Why am I here?
562;00:43:42,120;00:43:43,911;What am I supposed to do?
563;00:43:43,912;00:43:45,704;What does the Lord see in me?
564;00:43:47,704;00:43:49,037;And?
565;00:43:50,746;00:43:53,411;I don't know.
566;00:43:53,412;00:43:55,411;I don't understand our Lord.
567;00:43:55,412;00:43:57,245;Your Lord.
568;00:43:57,246;00:43:59,036;I don't know
568;00:43:57,246;00:43:59,036;what He wants from me.
569;00:43:59,037;00:44:03,537;I only know that
569;00:43:59,037;00:44:03,537;He wants me alive.
570;00:44:03,538;00:44:07,829;If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he
570;00:44:03,538;00:44:07,829;just tell you what the *** he wants?
571;00:44:09,912;00:44:11,703;Clegane.
572;00:44:11,704;00:44:13,079;Come over here.
573;00:44:15,746;00:44:17,454;Don't worry.
573;00:44:15,746;00:44:17,454;The fire won't bite.
574;00:44:18,954;00:44:21,745;I want to show you something.
575;00:44:21,746;00:44:24,954;It's my *** luck I end up
575;00:44:21,746;00:44:24,954;with a band of fire worshippers.
576;00:44:26,120;00:44:27,453;Aye.
577;00:44:27,454;00:44:29,787;Almost seems like
577;00:44:27,454;00:44:29,787;divine justice.
578;00:44:29,788;00:44:32,328;There's no divine justice,
578;00:44:29,788;00:44:32,328;you dumb ***.
579;00:44:32,329;00:44:35,453;If there was, you'd be dead...
580;00:44:35,454;00:44:37,621;and that girl would be alive.
581;00:44:43,995;00:44:46,828;What do you want?
581;00:44:43,995;00:44:46,828;Look into the flames.
582;00:44:46,829;00:44:48,953;I don't want to look
582;00:44:46,829;00:44:48,953;in the damn flames.
583;00:44:48,954;00:44:52,496;You saw me bring him back from
583;00:44:48,954;00:44:52,496;the dead after you cut him down.
584;00:44:54,120;00:44:56,370;Don't you want to know
584;00:44:54,120;00:44:56,370;what gave me the power?
585;00:44:56,371;00:44:59,828;I keep asking and no
585;00:44:56,371;00:44:59,828;one wants to tell me.
586;00:44:59,829;00:45:01,328;We can't tell you.
587;00:45:01,329;00:45:03,496;Only the fire can tell you.
588;00:45:16,079;00:45:17,538;What do you see?
589;00:45:19,287;00:45:20,745;Logs burning.
590;00:45:20,746;00:45:22,829;Keep looking.
591;00:45:28,496;00:45:29,704;What do you see?
592;00:45:39,204;00:45:41,911;Ice.
593;00:45:41,912;00:45:43,829;A wall of ice.
594;00:45:46,246;00:45:47,246;The Wall.
595;00:45:50,037;00:45:51,286;What else?
596;00:45:51,287;00:45:55,496;It's where the Wall
596;00:45:51,287;00:45:55,496;meets the sea.
597;00:45:56,704;00:45:58,912;There's a castle there.
598;00:46:06,329;00:46:07,828;There's a mountain.
599;00:46:07,829;00:46:11,287;Looks like an arrowhead.
600;00:46:13,912;00:46:16,079;The dead are marching past.
601;00:46:21,037;00:46:22,870;Thousands of them.
602;00:46:28,995;00:46:30,412;Do you believe me now, Clegane?
603;00:46:32,037;00:46:34,037;Do you believe
603;00:46:32,037;00:46:34,037;we're here for a reason?
604;00:47:05,704;00:47:07,287;What the hell
604;00:47:05,704;00:47:07,287;are you doing, Clegane?
605;00:47:10,704;00:47:12,287;Burying the dead.
606;00:47:25,371;00:47:27,495;You knew these people.
607;00:47:27,496;00:47:28,995;Not really.
608;00:48:29,496;00:48:33,328;We ask the Father
608;00:48:29,496;00:48:33,328;to judge us with mercy.
609;00:48:33,329;00:48:36,371;We ask the Mother to...
610;00:48:39,204;00:48:41,371;*** it, I don't
610;00:48:39,204;00:48:41,371;remember the rest.
611;00:48:47,912;00:48:50,869;I'm sorry you're dead.
612;00:48:50,870;00:48:53,787;You deserved better.
613;00:48:53,788;00:48:54,788;Both of you.
614;00:49:18,746;00:49:20,411;Hey.
615;00:49:25,579;00:49:26,994;Mom.
616;00:49:26,995;00:49:28,746;You should really sleep, Sam.
617;00:49:30,204;00:49:31,746;The dead don't.
618;00:49:40,954;00:49:44,120;Legends of the Long Night.
619;00:49:45,870;00:49:49,119;The Targaryens used dragonglass
619;00:49:45,870;00:49:49,119;to decorate their weapons
620;00:49:49,120;00:49:51,663;without even knowing what
620;00:49:49,120;00:49:51,663;the First Men used it for.
621;00:50:08,954;00:50:09,954;What is it?
622;00:50:11,746;00:50:13,703;It's a map of Dragonstone.
623;00:50:13,704;00:50:15,994;The Targaryens built
623;00:50:13,704;00:50:15,994;their first stronghold there
624;00:50:15,995;00:50:17,788;when they invaded Westeros.
625;00:50:20,496;00:50:22,245;That's dragonglass?
626;00:50:22,246;00:50:23,994;A mountain of it.
627;00:50:23,995;00:50:25,161;Beneath the ground.
628;00:50:25,162;00:50:27,495;Stannis told me,
628;00:50:25,162;00:50:27,495;but I didn't think...
629;00:50:27,496;00:50:30,995;This is important.
629;00:50:27,496;00:50:30,995;Jon needs to know.
630;00:51:24,287;00:51:26,370;Has she come yet?
631;00:51:26,371;00:51:27,994;Who?
632;00:51:28,195;00:51:30,203;The Dragon Queen.
633;00:51:30,204;00:51:32,162;Daenerys Stormborn.
634;00:51:33,870;00:51:35,079;Haven't heard anything.
635;00:57:15,162;00:57:16,724;Shall we begin?
