2;00:01:56,458;00:01:58,591;Yes?
3;00:02:00,528;00:02:02,595;For you, my lady.
4;00:02:21,616;00:02:24,050;How far is Mole's Town?
5;00:02:31,893;00:02:33,393;Sansa.
6;00:02:37,298;00:02:39,132;Lady Brienne.
7;00:02:41,770;00:02:45,071;When I heard you had escaped
7;00:02:41,770;00:02:45,071;Winterfell, I feared the worst.
8;00:02:47,042;00:02:49,308;You have no idea how happy I am
9;00:02:49,411;00:02:51,077;to see you unharmed.
10;00:02:52,213;00:02:54,447;Unharmed?
11;00:02:54,549;00:02:56,249;What are you doing here?
12;00:02:56,351;00:02:59,218;I rode north with the Knights of
12;00:02:56,351;00:02:59,218;the Vale to come to your aid.
13;00:02:59,320;00:03:02,155;They're encamped
13;00:02:59,320;00:03:02,155;at Moat Cailin as we speak.
14;00:03:02,257;00:03:04,057;To come to my aid?
15;00:03:05,694;00:03:08,394;Did you know about Ramsay?
16;00:03:08,496;00:03:10,730;If you didn't know, you're an idiot.
17;00:03:10,832;00:03:12,598;If you did know, you're my enemy.
18;00:03:13,968;00:03:16,703;Would you like to hear
18;00:03:13,968;00:03:16,703;about our wedding night?
19;00:03:18,873;00:03:21,107;He never hurt my face.
20;00:03:21,209;00:03:24,744;He needed my face, the face
20;00:03:21,209;00:03:24,744;of Ned Stark's daughter.
21;00:03:29,284;00:03:31,818;But the rest of me,
22;00:03:31,920;00:03:34,020;he did what he liked
22;00:03:31,920;00:03:34,020;with the rest of me
23;00:03:34,122;00:03:37,423;as long as I could
23;00:03:34,122;00:03:37,423;still give him an heir.
24;00:03:40,328;00:03:42,061;What do you think he did?
25;00:03:46,201;00:03:48,101;I can't begin
25;00:03:46,201;00:03:48,101;to contemplate--
26;00:03:48,203;00:03:50,203;What do you think he did to me?
27;00:03:58,480;00:04:01,647;Lady Sansa asked you a question.
28;00:04:01,750;00:04:03,216;He beat you.
29;00:04:03,318;00:04:04,584;Yes, he enjoyed that.
30;00:04:04,686;00:04:06,185;What else do you think he did?
31;00:04:06,287;00:04:08,454;Sansa, I--
31;00:04:06,287;00:04:08,454;What else?
32;00:04:11,126;00:04:12,625;Did he cut you?
33;00:04:14,629;00:04:17,430;Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.
33;00:04:14,629;00:04:17,430;I didn't know.
34;00:04:17,532;00:04:19,432;I thought you knew
34;00:04:17,532;00:04:19,432;everyone's secrets.
35;00:04:19,534;00:04:22,869;I made a mistake, a horrible mistake.
36;00:04:22,971;00:04:24,570;I underestimated a stranger.
37;00:04:26,141;00:04:27,640;The other things he did,
38;00:04:27,742;00:04:29,542;ladies aren't supposed
38;00:04:27,742;00:04:29,542;to talk about those things,
39;00:04:29,644;00:04:32,478;but I imagine brothel keepers
39;00:04:29,644;00:04:32,478;talk about them all the time.
40;00:04:34,983;00:04:37,283;I can still feel it.
41;00:04:37,385;00:04:40,520;I don't mean in my tender
41;00:04:37,385;00:04:40,520;heart it still pains me so.
42;00:04:40,622;00:04:44,490;I can still feel what he did in
42;00:04:40,622;00:04:44,490;my body standing here right now.
43;00:04:46,961;00:04:50,029;I'm so sorry.
44;00:04:50,131;00:04:52,031;You said you would protect me.
45;00:04:52,133;00:04:55,668;And I will. You must believe me
45;00:04:52,133;00:04:55,668;when I tell you that I will.
46;00:04:55,770;00:04:59,238;I don't believe you anymore.
46;00:04:55,770;00:04:59,238;I don't need you anymore.
47;00:04:59,340;00:05:01,140;You can't protect me.
48;00:05:01,242;00:05:03,109;You won't even be able
48;00:05:01,242;00:05:03,109;to protect yourself
49;00:05:03,211;00:05:05,478;if I tell Brienne to cut you down.
50;00:05:08,049;00:05:09,448;And why shouldn't I?
51;00:05:12,387;00:05:14,620;Do you want me to beg for my life?
52;00:05:14,722;00:05:17,056;If that's what you want, I will.
53;00:05:19,093;00:05:21,561;Whatever you ask that is in my power,
54;00:05:21,663;00:05:22,862;I will do.
55;00:05:22,964;00:05:26,799;What if I want you
55;00:05:22,964;00:05:26,799;to die here and now?
56;00:05:28,570;00:05:30,536;Then I will die.
57;00:05:32,373;00:05:35,875;You freed me from the monsters
57;00:05:32,373;00:05:35,875;who murdered my family
58;00:05:35,977;00:05:40,012;and you gave me to other
58;00:05:35,977;00:05:40,012;monsters who murdered my family.
59;00:05:41,683;00:05:43,749;Go back to Moat Cailin.
60;00:05:43,852;00:05:46,252;My brother and I will take
60;00:05:43,852;00:05:46,252;back the North on our own.
61;00:05:46,354;00:05:47,887;I never want to see you again.
62;00:05:47,989;00:05:51,224;I would do anything to undo
62;00:05:47,989;00:05:51,224;what's been done to you.
63;00:05:54,195;00:05:55,895;I know that I can't.
64;00:05:57,932;00:06:00,666;Will you allow me to say
64;00:05:57,932;00:06:00,666;one more thing before I go?
65;00:06:03,705;00:06:06,839;Your great-uncle
65;00:06:03,705;00:06:06,839;Brynden the Blackfish
66;00:06:06,941;00:06:10,610;has gathered what remains of the
66;00:06:06,941;00:06:10,610;Tully forces and retaken Riverrun.
67;00:06:10,712;00:06:12,845;You might consider seeking him out.
68;00:06:12,947;00:06:16,249;The time may come when you
68;00:06:12,947;00:06:16,249;need an army loyal to you.
69;00:06:16,351;00:06:17,351;I have an army.
70;00:06:17,418;00:06:19,418;Your brother's army.
71;00:06:27,896;00:06:28,961;Half-brother.
72;00:06:58,660;00:06:59,959;You're not ready.
73;00:07:02,297;00:07:05,164;You should go home
73;00:07:02,297;00:07:05,164;before it's too late.
74;00:08:01,522;00:08:05,124;You'll never be
74;00:08:01,522;00:08:05,124;one of us, Lady Stark.
75;00:08:20,241;00:08:22,008;She has a point.
76;00:08:27,882;00:08:31,484;None of the first Faceless Men
76;00:08:27,882;00:08:31,484;were born to lords and ladies.
77;00:08:31,586;00:08:34,553;They began as slaves
77;00:08:31,586;00:08:34,553;in the mines of Valyria.
78;00:08:34,655;00:08:36,188;Who was the first?
79;00:08:36,290;00:08:37,690;He was no one.
80;00:08:39,027;00:08:42,028;The Many-Faced God taught
80;00:08:39,027;00:08:42,028;him how to shed his face
81;00:08:42,130;00:08:43,763;and how to give the gift.
82;00:08:43,865;00:08:47,299;The man taught others in
82;00:08:43,865;00:08:47,299;exchange for their service.
83;00:08:47,402;00:08:50,836;Many served, many more
83;00:08:47,402;00:08:50,836;gifts were given.
84;00:08:50,938;00:08:53,806;Soon all the masters
84;00:08:50,938;00:08:53,806;and overseers were gone
85;00:08:53,908;00:08:56,108;and the Faceless Men fled.
86;00:08:56,210;00:08:58,010;Where did they go?
87;00:08:58,112;00:08:59,712;Here.
88;00:08:59,814;00:09:03,115;They founded the Free City of
88;00:08:59,814;00:09:03,115;Braavos and built this house.
89;00:09:04,519;00:09:07,453;These were the faces
89;00:09:04,519;00:09:07,453;they wore in life
90;00:09:07,555;00:09:10,089;when they were not wearing others.
91;00:09:10,191;00:09:12,958;The first Faceless Men.
92;00:09:14,495;00:09:16,295;And now a girl is one of them,
93;00:09:16,397;00:09:18,597;if a girl desires.
94;00:09:20,034;00:09:22,268;A girl has no desires.
95;00:09:29,510;00:09:31,077;Who?
96;00:09:38,553;00:09:41,287;An actress who calls
96;00:09:38,553;00:09:41,287;herself Lady Crane.
97;00:09:41,389;00:09:44,256;She performs at the theater
97;00:09:41,389;00:09:44,256;in Sheelba Square.
98;00:09:46,060;00:09:48,994;A girl has been given
98;00:09:46,060;00:09:48,994;a second chance.
99;00:09:49,097;00:09:51,297;There will not be a third.
100;00:09:51,399;00:09:53,499;One way or another,
101;00:09:53,601;00:09:56,602;a face will be added to the hall.
102;00:10:15,756;00:10:18,457;Ahh!
103;00:10:20,394;00:10:23,129;Oh, murdered by a boar.
104;00:10:23,231;00:10:25,798;The great big hairy whore.
105;00:10:25,900;00:10:29,468;He dug in his tusks
105;00:10:25,900;00:10:29,468;and dug out my guts
106;00:10:29,570;00:10:33,005;and soon I am no more.
107;00:10:33,107;00:10:36,008;Oh, come, Father,
107;00:10:33,107;00:10:36,008;in bed you must lie.
108;00:10:36,110;00:10:39,011;I love you, Father.
108;00:10:36,110;00:10:39,011;Please don't die.
109;00:10:39,113;00:10:42,781;Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine.
110;00:10:42,884;00:10:46,619;I feel the winds of winter
110;00:10:42,884;00:10:46,619;as they lick across the land.
111;00:10:46,721;00:10:50,122;And our son alone
111;00:10:46,721;00:10:50,122;on that cold, cold throne
112;00:10:50,224;00:10:52,358;without a guiding hand.
113;00:10:52,460;00:10:55,728;Who will teach him strength?
113;00:10:52,460;00:10:55,728;Who will teach him grace?
114;00:10:55,830;00:10:59,732;To whom will he turn when it's time to
114;00:10:55,830;00:10:59,732;learn to look darkness in the face?
115;00:10:59,834;00:11:03,402;Ned Stark will do fine.
115;00:10:59,834;00:11:03,402;Now bring me more wine.
116;00:11:05,973;00:11:07,806;Ooh!
117;00:11:07,909;00:11:10,476;Ooh, what's happened here, then?
118;00:11:10,578;00:11:12,411;He brought you here, Ned Stark,
119;00:11:12,513;00:11:14,914;'cause you're the brightest
119;00:11:12,513;00:11:14,914;fellow in the land.
120;00:11:15,016;00:11:16,582;You should be king of us all
121;00:11:16,684;00:11:18,884;and I should be your Hand.
122;00:11:18,986;00:11:21,220;We men of the North
122;00:11:18,986;00:11:21,220;are right good hands
123;00:11:21,322;00:11:23,122;at keeping people lawful.
124;00:11:23,224;00:11:24,857;I'd ask him for permission,
125;00:11:24,959;00:11:27,126;but he smells too bloody awful.
126;00:11:28,963;00:11:32,198;I die! I die!
127;00:11:32,300;00:11:35,467;And here I now must lie.
128;00:11:35,570;00:11:39,171;Oh, woe.
128;00:11:35,570;00:11:39,171;Oh, no.
129;00:11:40,908;00:11:45,144;Oh, I am about to go.
130;00:11:47,315;00:11:49,248;Will you stay on as Joffrey's Hand?
131;00:11:49,350;00:11:51,283;The Iron Throne's what I demand.
132;00:11:51,385;00:11:52,284;You cannot.
132;00:11:51,385;00:11:52,284;I can.
133;00:11:52,386;00:11:53,285;You will not.
133;00:11:52,386;00:11:53,285;I will.
134;00:11:53,387;00:11:55,054;You dare not.
134;00:11:53,387;00:11:55,054;I dare yes.
135;00:11:55,156;00:11:57,256;- The line of succession.
135;00:11:55,156;00:11:57,256;What's that mean?
136;00:11:57,358;00:11:59,124;- The proper progression.
136;00:11:57,358;00:11:59,124;What's that mean?
137;00:11:59,227;00:12:01,660;The lawful ascension.
137;00:11:59,227;00:12:01,660;What's that mean?
138;00:12:13,608;00:12:16,875;So move along, give me my chair
139;00:12:16,978;00:12:19,078;and there won't be no more trouble.
140;00:12:22,383;00:12:25,184;But we had a deal
140;00:12:22,383;00:12:25,184;all done and dusted.
141;00:12:25,286;00:12:28,487;I'm starting to think
141;00:12:25,286;00:12:28,487;you can't be trusted.
142;00:12:38,966;00:12:40,833;Save my father.
143;00:12:40,935;00:12:44,370;Truly you should. Killing the
143;00:12:40,935;00:12:44,370;man will do you no good.
144;00:12:44,472;00:12:46,739;Save him, please.
144;00:12:44,472;00:12:46,739;Show him mercy.
145;00:12:46,841;00:12:49,341;Show the people what
145;00:12:46,841;00:12:49,341;a good king should be.
146;00:12:49,443;00:12:51,677;Good people, you may all relax.
147;00:12:51,779;00:12:53,912;My father's friend
147;00:12:51,779;00:12:53,912;shall be spared the--
148;00:12:56,250;00:12:59,418;Father! No!
149;00:12:59,520;00:13:02,187;Oh, Father.
149;00:12:59,520;00:13:02,187;Oh!
150;00:13:11,465;00:13:12,898;Worry not!
151;00:13:13,000;00:13:14,500;All is well.
152;00:13:14,602;00:13:16,502;I have here a decree
153;00:13:16,604;00:13:19,371;from my father Tywin Lannister,
154;00:13:19,473;00:13:21,573;the richest man you'll see.
155;00:13:21,676;00:13:24,209;He proclaims me Hand of the King.
156;00:13:24,312;00:13:26,111;The position's mine for life.
157;00:13:26,213;00:13:28,580;And he's given me permission to take
158;00:13:28,683;00:13:30,816;Sansa as my wife.
159;00:13:33,621;00:13:35,654;You'll learn that
159;00:13:33,621;00:13:35,654;what I lack in height,
160;00:13:35,756;00:13:37,990;I make up for in appetite.
161;00:13:38,092;00:13:40,459;So let's forget about your plight,
162;00:13:40,561;00:13:42,661;and go rehearse our wedding night.
163;00:13:52,106;00:13:54,873;It's a wart.
163;00:13:52,106;00:13:54,873;Two warts.
164;00:13:54,975;00:13:56,809;I've got two fucking
164;00:13:54,975;00:13:56,809;warts on my cock.
165;00:13:56,911;00:14:00,746;Well, don't worry, love. They usually
165;00:13:56,911;00:14:00,746;go away in five or six years.
166;00:14:00,848;00:14:04,116;Oh, wash this, darling.
166;00:14:00,848;00:14:04,116;It stinks of me.
167;00:14:04,218;00:14:07,453;You can do better, Bianca, dear.
167;00:14:04,218;00:14:07,453;You must do.
168;00:14:07,555;00:14:09,221;I had two lines.
169;00:14:09,323;00:14:11,523;There are no small parts.
169;00:14:09,323;00:14:11,523;You rang very false.
170;00:14:11,625;00:14:13,192;I rang very false?
171;00:14:13,294;00:14:16,195;What you need, love, is for
171;00:14:13,294;00:14:16,195;someone to ring you true.
172;00:14:18,099;00:14:20,666;You weren't complaining
172;00:14:18,099;00:14:20,666;about me last night.
173;00:14:20,768;00:14:22,728;May I get you
173;00:14:20,768;00:14:22,728;some wine, Lady Crane?
174;00:14:22,803;00:14:24,870;I'm a rum girl, Bobono.
175;00:14:24,972;00:14:27,206;You need to know that if
175;00:14:24,972;00:14:27,206;we're going to be intimate.
176;00:14:27,308;00:14:28,874;Of course we're going to be intimate.
177;00:14:28,976;00:14:31,543;It's only a matter of time.
178;00:14:34,248;00:14:36,248;To our children.
179;00:14:36,350;00:14:38,350;May they have your talent.
180;00:14:38,452;00:14:40,352;And your filthy mind.
181;00:14:47,061;00:14:49,461;A girl will poison the rum.
182;00:14:49,563;00:14:51,797;Lady Crane is the only
182;00:14:49,563;00:14:51,797;one who drinks it.
183;00:14:55,803;00:14:58,904;If a girl could use one of
183;00:14:55,803;00:14:58,904;the faces from the hall...
184;00:14:59,006;00:15:01,140;A girl is not ready.
185;00:15:03,611;00:15:06,111;She's a good actress.
186;00:15:06,213;00:15:08,547;So a man has heard.
187;00:15:08,649;00:15:11,483;Seems like a decent woman.
188;00:15:14,488;00:15:17,923;Does death only come for the wicked
188;00:15:14,488;00:15:17,923;and leave the decent behind?
189;00:15:20,060;00:15:21,560;No.
190;00:15:25,299;00:15:26,865;Who wants her dead?
191;00:15:26,967;00:15:29,768;That does not matter.
191;00:15:26,967;00:15:29,768;The price was paid.
192;00:15:31,572;00:15:34,540;The younger actress.
193;00:15:34,642;00:15:37,976;She's jealous because
193;00:15:34,642;00:15:37,976;Lady Crane is better.
194;00:15:38,078;00:15:41,580;A girl must decide if she wants
194;00:15:38,078;00:15:41,580;to serve the Many-Faced God.
195;00:15:43,017;00:15:44,750;A girl has decided.
196;00:15:44,852;00:15:48,487;A servant does not ask questions.
197;00:16:58,025;00:17:00,425;No! No! No!
198;00:17:23,517;00:17:25,817;It was you.
199;00:17:25,920;00:17:27,619;You made the white walkers.
200;00:17:27,721;00:17:29,855;We were at war.
201;00:17:29,957;00:17:32,357;We were being slaughtered.
202;00:17:32,459;00:17:34,893;Our sacred trees cut down.
203;00:17:34,995;00:17:37,696;We needed to defend ourselves.
204;00:17:37,798;00:17:39,298;From whom?
205;00:17:39,400;00:17:41,934;From you.
206;00:17:42,036;00:17:44,236;From men.
207;00:17:52,880;00:17:56,582;We speak in the
207;00:17:52,880;00:17:56,582;presence of the Drowned God.
208;00:17:56,684;00:17:58,750;In his name we gather today
209;00:17:58,852;00:18:02,454;to choose a new king as our leader.
210;00:18:02,556;00:18:04,423;Who makes a claim?
211;00:18:09,330;00:18:11,597;I am Yara Greyjoy,
212;00:18:11,699;00:18:14,099;daughter of Balon Greyjoy,
213;00:18:14,201;00:18:16,435;King of the Iron Islands.
214;00:18:17,771;00:18:19,705;I claim the Salt Throne.
215;00:18:19,807;00:18:22,374;We've never had a queen.
215;00:18:19,807;00:18:22,374;Not once.
216;00:18:22,476;00:18:24,910;There are many things
216;00:18:22,476;00:18:24,910;we've never done.
217;00:18:25,012;00:18:27,746;We've never made our mark
217;00:18:25,012;00:18:27,746;upon the world.
218;00:18:27,848;00:18:31,283;The great lords of
218;00:18:27,848;00:18:31,283;Westeros pay us no mind
219;00:18:31,385;00:18:34,419;until our little raids
219;00:18:31,385;00:18:34,419;buzz through their kingdoms
220;00:18:34,521;00:18:36,154;long enough to become a nuisance.
221;00:18:36,256;00:18:38,523;Then they swat us down.
222;00:18:38,626;00:18:42,127;They conquer us, humiliate us,
223;00:18:42,229;00:18:44,663;and go right back
223;00:18:42,229;00:18:44,663;to forgetting we exist.
224;00:18:44,765;00:18:46,665;Aye!
225;00:18:46,767;00:18:49,101;We are a sea people.
225;00:18:46,767;00:18:49,101;Aye!
226;00:18:49,203;00:18:52,471;Our god is a sea god.
226;00:18:49,203;00:18:52,471;Aye!
227;00:18:52,573;00:18:54,706;When I am queen, we will
227;00:18:52,573;00:18:54,706;build a fleet that--
228;00:18:54,808;00:18:56,508;You shall not be queen!
228;00:18:54,808;00:18:56,508;I am not finished!
229;00:18:56,610;00:18:59,177;Yes, you are!
229;00:18:56,610;00:18:59,177;A woman will not lead us.
230;00:18:59,279;00:19:02,614;Not when Balon's
230;00:18:59,279;00:19:02,614;own male heir has returned.
231;00:19:29,643;00:19:31,677;I am Theon Greyjoy...
232;00:19:33,147;00:19:36,048;last living son of Balon Greyjoy.
233;00:19:44,091;00:19:46,692;And she is your rightful ruler.
234;00:19:46,794;00:19:48,026;Aye!
235;00:19:48,128;00:19:49,728;Those of you that have
235;00:19:48,128;00:19:49,728;sailed under her,
236;00:19:49,830;00:19:51,730;and there are many of you here,
237;00:19:51,832;00:19:54,433;you know what she is.
237;00:19:51,832;00:19:54,433;Aye!
238;00:19:54,535;00:19:55,834;She is a reaver.
238;00:19:54,535;00:19:55,834;Aye!
239;00:19:55,936;00:19:58,170;She is a warrior.
239;00:19:55,936;00:19:58,170;Aye!
240;00:19:58,272;00:20:00,038;She is ironborn!
241;00:20:00,140;00:20:01,740;Aye!
242;00:20:01,842;00:20:04,409;We will find no better leader.
243;00:20:07,481;00:20:09,281;This is our queen.
244;00:20:14,555;00:20:18,490;Yara! Yara! Yara!
245;00:20:18,592;00:20:21,193;I'm Euron Greyjoy.
246;00:20:21,295;00:20:23,729;I claim the Salt Throne.
247;00:20:34,875;00:20:36,374;Niece.
248;00:20:37,945;00:20:38,945;Nephew.
249;00:20:40,814;00:20:42,614;Little Theon.
250;00:20:44,284;00:20:47,219;Heard you managed to fuck
250;00:20:44,284;00:20:47,219;things right into the ground.
251;00:20:48,856;00:20:50,722;Captured a castle you couldn't keep.
252;00:20:50,824;00:20:53,825;Got yourself taken prisoner.
253;00:20:53,927;00:20:56,128;Even heard you have no cock.
254;00:21:00,067;00:21:02,400;Explains why you think
254;00:21:00,067;00:21:02,400;a woman can be king.
255;00:21:02,503;00:21:04,269;When did you return, Uncle?
256;00:21:04,371;00:21:06,571;A few days ago.
257;00:21:06,673;00:21:09,040;I had some things to take care of.
258;00:21:09,143;00:21:10,909;Long overdue.
259;00:21:12,212;00:21:13,779;I'm glad you're here.
260;00:21:15,849;00:21:19,518;Now I know what my first
260;00:21:15,849;00:21:19,518;act as queen will be.
261;00:21:19,620;00:21:22,454;To execute the man
261;00:21:19,620;00:21:22,454;who killed my father.
262;00:21:28,896;00:21:30,362;I did.
263;00:21:30,464;00:21:32,597;I killed him.
264;00:21:34,067;00:21:36,668;Threw him right over a rope bridge
265;00:21:36,770;00:21:39,938;and watched him fall.
266;00:21:40,040;00:21:41,706;He was leading us nowhere
267;00:21:41,809;00:21:44,442;and we would still be heading
267;00:21:41,809;00:21:44,442;there if it weren't for me.
268;00:21:44,545;00:21:47,612;No one loved him.
268;00:21:44,545;00:21:47,612;No one wanted to follow him.
269;00:21:47,714;00:21:50,448;He led us into two wars
269;00:21:47,714;00:21:50,448;we couldn't win.
270;00:21:50,551;00:21:54,519;I apologize to you all for
270;00:21:50,551;00:21:54,519;not killing him years ago.
271;00:21:54,621;00:21:56,822;That would have been hard to do.
272;00:21:56,924;00:21:58,890;You weren't here.
273;00:21:58,992;00:22:02,561;Last I heard, you were gallivanting
273;00:21:58,992;00:22:02,561;around the world having a grand old time.
274;00:22:02,663;00:22:04,129;Gallivanting?
275;00:22:04,231;00:22:05,931;That the sort of thing
275;00:22:04,231;00:22:05,931;you start to say
276;00:22:06,033;00:22:08,466;once your dick gets chopped off?
277;00:22:08,569;00:22:11,403;Did the great lords of Westeros
277;00:22:08,569;00:22:11,403;teach you words like that?
278;00:22:12,773;00:22:14,573;You were gone.
279;00:22:14,675;00:22:16,174;Yara was here.
280;00:22:16,276;00:22:18,977;Being ironborn.
280;00:22:16,276;00:22:18,977;Leading ironborn.
281;00:22:19,079;00:22:21,980;Getting ready to bring us
281;00:22:19,079;00:22:21,980;back to glory.
282;00:22:22,082;00:22:23,548;And how will she do that?
283;00:22:23,650;00:22:28,019;I will build the largest fleet
283;00:22:23,650;00:22:28,019;the world has ever seen.
284;00:22:30,224;00:22:34,426;Right idea, except I'm the one who's
284;00:22:30,224;00:22:34,426;going to build the Iron Fleet
285;00:22:34,528;00:22:36,828;because I'm the one
285;00:22:34,528;00:22:36,828;who knows how to use it.
286;00:22:36,930;00:22:38,396;I've been all over the world.
287;00:22:38,498;00:22:41,833;I've seen more of it
287;00:22:38,498;00:22:41,833;than all of you combined.
288;00:22:41,935;00:22:44,870;And across the sea there is a person
289;00:22:44,972;00:22:48,807;who hates the great lords of
289;00:22:44,972;00:22:48,807;Westeros just as much as we do.
290;00:22:48,909;00:22:51,509;Someone with a large army,
291;00:22:51,612;00:22:55,380;three large dragons, and no husband.
292;00:22:55,482;00:22:57,716;I'm going to build that fleet
293;00:22:57,818;00:23:00,018;and I'm going to gallivant right over
294;00:23:00,120;00:23:02,254;and give it to Daenerys Targaryen
295;00:23:02,356;00:23:04,756;along with my big cock.
296;00:23:04,858;00:23:06,858;You're going to seduce
296;00:23:04,858;00:23:06,858;the Dragon Queen?
297;00:23:06,960;00:23:10,195;I'm not going to seduce her.
297;00:23:06,960;00:23:10,195;The Iron Fleet will seduce her.
298;00:23:10,297;00:23:13,098;And together we're going
298;00:23:10,297;00:23:13,098;to take the Seven Kingdoms.
299;00:23:13,200;00:23:16,568;I wasn't born to be king.
300;00:23:16,670;00:23:19,170;I paid the iron price
301;00:23:19,273;00:23:20,739;and here I stand.
302;00:23:22,576;00:23:26,278;Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!
303;00:23:26,380;00:23:30,315;Euron! Euron!
303;00:23:26,380;00:23:30,315;Euron! Euron!
304;00:23:30,417;00:23:32,584;Euron! Euron!
305;00:23:43,697;00:23:46,498;May Euron, your servant,
305;00:23:43,697;00:23:46,498;be born again
306;00:23:46,600;00:23:49,134;from the sea as you were.
307;00:23:49,236;00:23:52,304;Bless him with salt.
307;00:23:49,236;00:23:52,304;Bless him with stone.
308;00:23:52,406;00:23:54,306;Bless him with steel.
309;00:23:54,408;00:23:57,042;Listen to the waves.
309;00:23:54,408;00:23:57,042;Listen to the god.
310;00:23:57,144;00:24:00,278;He is speaking to us and he says
311;00:24:00,380;00:24:05,417;we shall have no king
311;00:24:00,380;00:24:05,417;but Euron Greyjoy.
312;00:24:05,519;00:24:08,720;Let the sea wash your follies
312;00:24:05,519;00:24:08,720;and your vanities away.
313;00:24:08,822;00:24:11,089;Let the old Euron drown.
314;00:24:11,191;00:24:13,992;Let his lungs fill with seawater.
315;00:24:19,700;00:24:22,968;Let the fish eat
315;00:24:19,700;00:24:22,968;the scales off his eyes.
316;00:24:23,070;00:24:25,637;What is dead may never die,
317;00:24:25,739;00:24:29,374;but rises again harder and stronger.
318;00:25:36,576;00:25:38,710;What is dead may never die.
319;00:25:38,812;00:25:42,047;What is dead may never die.
320;00:25:55,996;00:25:58,430;Where are my niece and nephew?
321;00:26:03,403;00:26:05,537;Let's go murder them.
322;00:26:25,592;00:26:27,792;They stole our best ships.
323;00:26:29,129;00:26:31,096;Won't be enough to save them.
324;00:26:32,899;00:26:35,033;Go back to your homes.
325;00:26:35,135;00:26:37,502;Chop down every tree you can find.
326;00:26:37,604;00:26:40,171;Quarter-saw the timber
326;00:26:37,604;00:26:40,171;and start building.
327;00:26:40,273;00:26:42,340;I want every man bending planks.
328;00:26:42,442;00:26:45,944;I want every woman
328;00:26:42,442;00:26:45,944;spinning flax for sails.
329;00:26:46,046;00:26:48,346;Build me a thousand ships
330;00:26:48,448;00:26:50,915;and I will give you this world.
331;00:27:10,070;00:27:12,837;I banished you twice.
332;00:27:14,207;00:27:17,108;You came back twice.
333;00:27:20,447;00:27:22,347;And you saved my life.
334;00:27:26,987;00:27:28,987;So I can't take you back
335;00:27:29,089;00:27:31,189;and I can't send you away.
336;00:27:33,693;00:27:35,660;You must send me away.
337;00:27:48,708;00:27:50,441;Is there a cure?
338;00:27:50,544;00:27:52,844;I don't know.
339;00:27:53,847;00:27:55,813;How long does it take?
340;00:27:55,916;00:27:58,416;I don't know that either.
341;00:27:58,518;00:28:00,919;But I've seen what happens
341;00:27:58,518;00:28:00,919;when it goes far enough.
342;00:28:02,422;00:28:04,055;I'll end things before that.
343;00:28:07,627;00:28:09,727;I'm sorry.
344;00:28:10,797;00:28:11,996;I'm so sorry.
345;00:28:12,098;00:28:14,299;Don't be.
346;00:28:14,401;00:28:16,868;All I've ever wanted
346;00:28:14,401;00:28:16,868;was to serve you.
347;00:28:20,040;00:28:22,607;Tyrion Lannister was right.
348;00:28:25,278;00:28:27,845;I love you.
349;00:28:32,219;00:28:34,452;I'll always love you.
350;00:28:38,758;00:28:41,059;Good-bye, khaleesi.
351;00:28:46,399;00:28:48,733;Do not walk away from your queen,
352;00:28:48,835;00:28:50,902;Jorah the Andal.
353;00:28:53,006;00:28:55,306;You have not been dismissed.
354;00:28:56,676;00:28:59,043;You pledged yourself to me.
355;00:28:59,145;00:29:02,447;You swore to obey my commands
355;00:28:59,145;00:29:02,447;for the rest of your life.
356;00:29:04,517;00:29:08,086;Well, I command you to find the cure
357;00:29:08,188;00:29:10,722;wherever it is in this world.
358;00:29:13,126;00:29:15,793;I command you to heal yourself
359;00:29:15,895;00:29:18,763;and then return to me.
360;00:29:21,868;00:29:24,602;When I take the Seven Kingdoms,
361;00:29:24,704;00:29:27,171;I need you by my side.
362;00:30:05,979;00:30:09,547;In the last fortnight since
362;00:30:05,979;00:30:09,547;our pact with the Masters,
363;00:30:09,649;00:30:12,950;how many killings have been carried
363;00:30:09,649;00:30:12,950;out by the Sons of the Harpy?
364;00:30:13,053;00:30:14,619;None.
365;00:30:14,721;00:30:17,655;And how many Masters have been
365;00:30:14,721;00:30:17,655;butchered by the free men?
366;00:30:17,757;00:30:20,325;Two, but that was
366;00:30:17,757;00:30:20,325;the day of the pact.
367;00:30:20,427;00:30:22,160;Since then, nothing.
368;00:30:22,262;00:30:25,263;So it's safe to say that a
368;00:30:22,262;00:30:25,263;fragile peace has taken hold.
369;00:30:25,365;00:30:26,731;For now.
370;00:30:26,833;00:30:28,733;For now is the best we
370;00:30:26,833;00:30:28,733;get in our profession.
371;00:30:28,835;00:30:30,335;It's not enough.
372;00:30:30,437;00:30:32,236;Considering the city was
372;00:30:30,437;00:30:32,236;on the brink of civil war,
373;00:30:32,339;00:30:33,838;I'd say it's a good start.
374;00:30:33,940;00:30:36,507;It's not enough
374;00:30:33,940;00:30:36,507;for Meereen to have peace.
375;00:30:36,609;00:30:39,077;They need to know Daenerys
375;00:30:36,609;00:30:39,077;is responsible for it.
376;00:30:39,179;00:30:41,946;The Sons of the Harpy
376;00:30:39,179;00:30:41,946;have a good story.
377;00:30:42,048;00:30:44,215;Resist the foreign invaders.
378;00:30:44,317;00:30:46,417;Our queen has an even better story.
379;00:30:46,519;00:30:51,189;Mother of Dragons, Breaker
379;00:30:46,519;00:30:51,189;of Chains and all that.
380;00:30:51,291;00:30:53,658;The people know
380;00:30:51,291;00:30:53,658;who brought them freedom.
381;00:30:53,760;00:30:56,227;Yes, but do they know
381;00:30:53,760;00:30:56,227;who brought them security?
382;00:30:56,329;00:30:58,363;Who brought about
382;00:30:56,329;00:30:58,363;an end to the violence?
383;00:30:58,465;00:31:01,065;We need someone the people trust,
384;00:31:01,167;00:31:04,569;someone they know cannot
384;00:31:01,167;00:31:04,569;be bought or influenced.
385;00:31:04,671;00:31:07,805;Sounds like quite the hero.
385;00:31:04,671;00:31:07,805;Where would we find him?
386;00:31:07,907;00:31:10,174;Who said anything about him?
387;00:31:12,148;00:31:14,612;_
388;00:31:15,449;00:31:17,993;_
389;00:31:18,824;00:31:20,078;_
390;00:31:20,314;00:31:21,542;_
391;00:31:21,941;00:31:25,237;_
392;00:31:30,996;00:31:36,085;_
393;00:31:36,903;00:31:39,871;That's about the extent
393;00:31:36,903;00:31:39,871;of my Valyrian.
394;00:31:45,645;00:31:48,446;Thank you for travelling
394;00:31:45,645;00:31:48,446;all this way.
395;00:31:48,548;00:31:52,383;I know from personal experience how
395;00:31:48,548;00:31:52,383;uncomfortable the journey can be.
396;00:31:56,990;00:32:00,124;The truth is we need your help.
397;00:32:00,226;00:32:03,327;We had hoped that we could
397;00:32:00,226;00:32:03,327;somehow persuade you to--
398;00:32:03,430;00:32:05,663;You don't need to persuade me.
399;00:32:05,765;00:32:07,565;I came to help.
400;00:32:07,667;00:32:10,835;Daenerys Stormborn is the
400;00:32:07,667;00:32:10,835;one who was promised.
401;00:32:10,937;00:32:14,806;From the fire she was
401;00:32:10,937;00:32:14,806;reborn to remake the world.
402;00:32:14,908;00:32:16,908;Yes.
403;00:32:17,010;00:32:18,876;She has freed the slaves
403;00:32:17,010;00:32:18,876;from their chains
404;00:32:18,978;00:32:22,513;and crucified the Masters
404;00:32:18,978;00:32:22,513;for their sins.
405;00:32:22,615;00:32:24,382;She did indeed.
406;00:32:24,484;00:32:27,351;Her dragons are fire made flesh,
407;00:32:27,454;00:32:29,287;a gift from the Lord of Light.
408;00:32:29,389;00:32:32,290;But you heard all of this
408;00:32:29,389;00:32:32,290;before, haven't you?
409;00:32:32,392;00:32:34,759;On the Long Bridge of Volantis.
410;00:32:37,030;00:32:40,431;The dragons will purify
410;00:32:37,030;00:32:40,431;nonbelievers by the thousands,
411;00:32:40,533;00:32:42,900;burning their sins and flesh away.
412;00:32:43,002;00:32:47,705;Ideally we'd avoid purifying
412;00:32:43,002;00:32:47,705;too many nonbelievers.
413;00:32:47,807;00:32:50,808;The Mother of Dragons has followers
413;00:32:47,807;00:32:50,808;of many different faiths.
414;00:32:50,910;00:32:54,078;You want your queen to be
414;00:32:50,910;00:32:54,078;worshipped and obeyed.
415;00:32:54,180;00:32:56,981;And while she's gone,
415;00:32:54,180;00:32:56,981;you want her advisors
416;00:32:57,083;00:32:58,749;to be worshipped and obeyed.
417;00:32:58,852;00:33:02,086;I'd settle for obeyed.
418;00:33:02,188;00:33:05,189;I will summon
418;00:33:02,188;00:33:05,189;my most eloquent priests.
419;00:33:05,291;00:33:07,892;They will spread the word.
420;00:33:07,994;00:33:11,596;Daenerys has been sent to lead
420;00:33:07,994;00:33:11,596;the people against the darkness
421;00:33:11,698;00:33:15,800;in this war and in the
421;00:33:11,698;00:33:15,800;great war still to come.
422;00:33:15,902;00:33:17,368;That sounds most excellent.
423;00:33:17,470;00:33:20,438;A man named Stannis
423;00:33:17,470;00:33:20,438;Baratheon was anointed
424;00:33:20,540;00:33:23,307;as the chosen one
424;00:33:20,540;00:33:23,307;by one of your priestesses.
425;00:33:23,409;00:33:26,244;He, too, had a glorious destiny.
426;00:33:26,346;00:33:29,514;He attacked King's Landing
426;00:33:26,346;00:33:29,514;and was soundly defeated
427;00:33:29,616;00:33:31,716;by the man standing beside me.
428;00:33:31,818;00:33:34,285;Last I had heard,
428;00:33:31,818;00:33:34,285;he had been defeated again,
429;00:33:34,387;00:33:38,556;this time at Winterfell
429;00:33:34,387;00:33:38,556;and this time for good.
430;00:33:38,658;00:33:41,759;We'd be most grateful for any support
430;00:33:38,658;00:33:41,759;you could provide the queen.
431;00:33:41,861;00:33:44,962;I suppose it's hard for a
431;00:33:41,861;00:33:44,962;fanatic to admit a mistake.
432;00:33:45,064;00:33:48,599;Isn't that the whole point
432;00:33:45,064;00:33:48,599;of being a fanatic?
433;00:33:48,701;00:33:50,868;You're always right.
434;00:33:50,970;00:33:53,571;Everything is the Lord's will.
435;00:33:53,673;00:33:57,341;Everything is the Lord's will.
436;00:33:57,443;00:34:00,211;But men and women make mistakes.
437;00:34:00,313;00:34:02,246;Even honest servants of the Lord.
438;00:34:02,348;00:34:06,284;And you, an honest
438;00:34:02,348;00:34:06,284;servant of the Lord,
439;00:34:06,386;00:34:08,886;why should I trust you
439;00:34:06,386;00:34:08,886;to know any more
440;00:34:08,988;00:34:10,855;than the priestess
440;00:34:08,988;00:34:10,855;who counseled Stannis?
441;00:34:10,957;00:34:13,925;My friend has a healthy
441;00:34:10,957;00:34:13,925;skepticism of religion,
442;00:34:14,027;00:34:16,761;but we are all loyal
442;00:34:14,027;00:34:16,761;supporters of the queen.
443;00:34:21,935;00:34:23,868;Everyone is what they are
444;00:34:23,970;00:34:27,672;and where they are for a reason.
445;00:34:27,774;00:34:30,942;Terrible things happen for a reason.
446;00:34:31,044;00:34:34,712;Take what happened to you, Lord
446;00:34:31,044;00:34:34,712;Varys, when you were a child.
447;00:34:36,416;00:34:38,149;If not for your mutilation
448;00:34:38,251;00:34:40,151;at the hand of
448;00:34:38,251;00:34:40,151;a second-rate sorcerer,
449;00:34:40,253;00:34:43,487;you wouldn't be here
449;00:34:40,253;00:34:43,487;helping the Lord's Chosen
450;00:34:43,590;00:34:46,691;bring his light into the world.
451;00:34:46,793;00:34:50,027;Knowledge has made you powerful.
452;00:34:50,129;00:34:53,230;But there's still
452;00:34:50,129;00:34:53,230;so much you don't know.
453;00:34:55,368;00:34:58,336;Do you remember
453;00:34:55,368;00:34:58,336;what you heard that night
454;00:34:58,438;00:35:01,973;when the sorcerer tossed
454;00:34:58,438;00:35:01,973;your parts in the fire?
455;00:35:04,077;00:35:07,678;You heard a voice call out from the flames.
455;00:35:04,077;00:35:07,678;Do you remember?
456;00:35:10,183;00:35:13,985;Should I tell you
456;00:35:10,183;00:35:13,985;what the voice said?
457;00:35:14,087;00:35:17,655;Should I tell you the name
457;00:35:14,087;00:35:17,655;of the one who spoke?
458;00:35:27,300;00:35:29,467;We serve the same queen.
459;00:35:29,569;00:35:31,602;If you are her true friend,
460;00:35:31,704;00:35:34,338;you have nothing to fear from me.
461;00:37:24,283;00:37:25,816;What?
462;00:39:09,589;00:39:11,589;He saw me, the Night King!
463;00:39:11,691;00:39:13,858;He saw me!
463;00:39:11,691;00:39:13,858;He touched you.
464;00:39:15,394;00:39:17,528;I don't know.
464;00:39:15,394;00:39:17,528;He was close, but--
465;00:39:17,630;00:39:18,630;He touched you.
466;00:39:21,934;00:39:23,968;He knows you are here.
466;00:39:21,934;00:39:23,968;He'll come for you.
467;00:39:24,070;00:39:25,469;But he can't get in.
468;00:39:25,571;00:39:29,106;He can now.
468;00:39:25,571;00:39:29,106;His mark is on you.
469;00:39:29,208;00:39:31,175;You must leave, all of you.
470;00:39:35,214;00:39:37,147;Come on, Hodor.
470;00:39:35,214;00:39:37,147;Help me with the sledge.
471;00:39:37,250;00:39:39,049;Hodor.
472;00:39:39,151;00:39:41,118;I'm sorry.
472;00:39:39,151;00:39:41,118;I didn't mean to.
473;00:39:41,220;00:39:44,121;The time has come.
473;00:39:41,220;00:39:44,121;The time for what?
474;00:39:44,223;00:39:47,258;For you to become me.
475;00:39:47,360;00:39:51,462;But am I ready?
476;00:39:51,564;00:39:53,464;No.
477;00:39:55,401;00:39:58,135;We can't defend the north
477;00:39:55,401;00:39:58,135;from the walkers
478;00:39:58,237;00:39:59,970;and the south from the Boltons.
479;00:40:00,072;00:40:02,006;If we want to survive,
479;00:40:00,072;00:40:02,006;we need Winterfell
480;00:40:02,108;00:40:04,909;and to take Winterfell,
480;00:40:02,108;00:40:04,909;we need more men.
481;00:40:08,114;00:40:10,781;Aside from the
481;00:40:08,114;00:40:10,781;Starks and the Boltons,
482;00:40:10,883;00:40:13,584;the most powerful houses in the North
483;00:40:13,686;00:40:15,719;are the Umbers, the Karstarks,
484;00:40:15,821;00:40:17,454;and the Manderlys.
485;00:40:17,556;00:40:20,257;The Umbers and the Karstarks
486;00:40:20,359;00:40:22,293;have already declared
486;00:40:20,359;00:40:22,293;for the Boltons,
487;00:40:22,395;00:40:24,028;so we're not doing so well there.
488;00:40:24,130;00:40:26,764;The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies.
488;00:40:24,130;00:40:26,764;They can hang.
489;00:40:26,866;00:40:29,099;But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay
490;00:40:29,201;00:40:31,702;without knowing
490;00:40:29,201;00:40:31,702;they had another choice.
491;00:40:31,804;00:40:34,138;I beg your pardon, my lady,
492;00:40:34,240;00:40:37,374;but they know that a Stark
492;00:40:34,240;00:40:37,374;beheaded their father.
493;00:40:37,476;00:40:39,510;I don't think we can
493;00:40:37,476;00:40:39,510;count on them either.
494;00:40:41,180;00:40:43,881;How well do you know
494;00:40:41,180;00:40:43,881;the North, Ser Davos?
495;00:40:43,983;00:40:45,349;Precious little, my lady.
496;00:40:45,451;00:40:47,584;My father always said
496;00:40:45,451;00:40:47,584;Northerners are different.
497;00:40:47,687;00:40:51,388;More loyal, more
497;00:40:47,687;00:40:51,388;suspicious of outsiders.
498;00:40:51,490;00:40:53,057;They may well be loyal,
499;00:40:53,159;00:40:55,125;but how many rose up
499;00:40:53,159;00:40:55,125;against the Boltons
500;00:40:55,227;00:40:56,994;when they betrayed your family?
501;00:40:59,332;00:41:01,932;I may not know the North,
501;00:40:59,332;00:41:01,932;but I know men.
502;00:41:02,034;00:41:04,535;They're more or less the same
502;00:41:02,034;00:41:04,535;in any corner of the world
503;00:41:04,637;00:41:07,538;and even the bravest of
503;00:41:04,637;00:41:07,538;them don't want to see
504;00:41:07,640;00:41:10,941;their wives and children
504;00:41:07,640;00:41:10,941;skinned for a lost cause.
505;00:41:11,043;00:41:14,378;If Jon's going to convince
505;00:41:11,043;00:41:14,378;them to fight alongside him,
506;00:41:14,480;00:41:16,447;they need to believe
506;00:41:14,480;00:41:16,447;it's a fight they can win.
507;00:41:16,549;00:41:19,116;There are more than three
507;00:41:16,549;00:41:19,116;other houses in the North--
508;00:41:19,218;00:41:21,852;Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn,
509;00:41:21,954;00:41:23,554;Mazin, Hornwood.
510;00:41:23,656;00:41:27,257;Two dozen more. Together
510;00:41:23,656;00:41:27,257;they equal all the others.
511;00:41:27,360;00:41:29,326;We can start small and build.
512;00:41:29,428;00:41:31,862;The North remembers.
513;00:41:31,964;00:41:33,430;They remember the Stark name.
514;00:41:33,532;00:41:35,432;People will still risk
514;00:41:33,532;00:41:35,432;everything for it,
515;00:41:35,534;00:41:37,735;from White Harbor
515;00:41:35,534;00:41:37,735;to Ramsay's own door.
516;00:41:37,837;00:41:40,037;I don't doubt it.
517;00:41:40,139;00:41:42,239;But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.
518;00:41:42,341;00:41:44,408;No, but I do.
519;00:41:47,313;00:41:49,947;Jon is every bit
519;00:41:47,313;00:41:49,947;as much Ned Stark's son
520;00:41:50,049;00:41:51,849;as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's.
521;00:41:51,951;00:41:53,991;And there are also the Tullys.
521;00:41:51,951;00:41:53,991;They're not Northern,
522;00:41:54,086;00:41:57,054;but they will back us against
522;00:41:54,086;00:41:57,054;the Boltons without question.
523;00:41:57,156;00:41:58,689;I didn't know the Tullys
523;00:41:57,156;00:41:58,689;still had an army.
524;00:41:58,791;00:42:00,724;My uncle the Blackfish
524;00:41:58,791;00:42:00,724;has reformed it
525;00:42:00,826;00:42:02,059;and retaken Riverrun.
526;00:42:02,161;00:42:04,228;How do you know that?
527;00:42:05,598;00:42:08,599;Ramsay received a raven
527;00:42:05,598;00:42:08,599;before I escaped Winterfell.
528;00:42:10,636;00:42:12,369;That's good.
529;00:42:12,471;00:42:14,471;The Blackfish is a legend.
530;00:42:14,573;00:42:16,974;His support would mean a great deal.
531;00:42:17,076;00:42:20,077;Stark, Tully, a few more houses,
532;00:42:20,179;00:42:22,413;almost starts to look
532;00:42:20,179;00:42:22,413;like a winning side.
533;00:42:24,817;00:42:26,884;I've sworn to protect you, my lady.
534;00:42:26,986;00:42:28,752;You heard them.
534;00:42:26,986;00:42:28,752;We need more men
535;00:42:28,854;00:42:30,654;and my uncle has an army.
536;00:42:30,756;00:42:32,289;We can send the Blackfish a raven.
537;00:42:32,391;00:42:34,425;Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.
538;00:42:34,527;00:42:36,193;It has to be you.
539;00:42:36,295;00:42:38,562;Ride for Riverrun.
539;00:42:36,295;00:42:38,562;My uncle will talk to you
540;00:42:38,664;00:42:40,464;and you'll know how to talk to him.
541;00:42:42,802;00:42:44,234;What is it?
542;00:42:46,038;00:42:48,072;I don't like leaving you here alone.
543;00:42:48,174;00:42:49,473;With Jon?
544;00:42:49,575;00:42:52,342;Not him.
544;00:42:49,575;00:42:52,342;He seems trustworthy.
545;00:42:52,445;00:42:54,445;A bit brooding, perhaps.
546;00:42:54,547;00:42:56,613;I suppose that's
546;00:42:54,547;00:42:56,613;understandable, considering.
547;00:42:58,350;00:43:00,217;The others, though.
548;00:43:02,388;00:43:06,023;Davos and the Red Woman helped
548;00:43:02,388;00:43:06,023;a man murder his own brother
549;00:43:06,125;00:43:07,724;with bloodmagic.
550;00:43:07,827;00:43:10,427;And when Stannis paid for
550;00:43:07,827;00:43:10,427;his crime, where were they?
551;00:43:10,529;00:43:14,731;Already out looking for a
551;00:43:10,529;00:43:14,731;leader with better prospects.
552;00:43:14,834;00:43:17,267;And that wildling fellow
552;00:43:14,834;00:43:17,267;with the beard--
553;00:43:17,369;00:43:20,604;Jon isn't Tormund. Jon
553;00:43:17,369;00:43:20,604;isn't Davos, the Red Woman
554;00:43:20,706;00:43:23,707;or Stannis for that matter.
554;00:43:20,706;00:43:23,707;Jon is Jon.
555;00:43:23,809;00:43:27,277;He's my brother. He'll keep me safe.
555;00:43:23,809;00:43:27,277;I trust him.
556;00:43:29,748;00:43:33,684;Then why did you lie to him when he asked
556;00:43:29,748;00:43:33,684;you how you learned about Riverrun?
557;00:43:42,895;00:43:44,561;New dress?
558;00:43:44,663;00:43:47,397;I made it myself.
558;00:43:44,663;00:43:47,397;Do you like it?
559;00:43:47,500;00:43:51,502;Yeah, it's--
559;00:43:47,500;00:43:51,502;I like the wolf bit.
560;00:43:51,604;00:43:55,706;Good, because I made this for you.
561;00:43:58,410;00:44:00,711;I made it like the one
561;00:43:58,410;00:44:00,711;Father used to wear.
562;00:44:00,813;00:44:03,714;As near as I can remember.
563;00:44:05,484;00:44:07,184;Thank you, Sansa.
564;00:44:07,286;00:44:08,952;You're welcome.
565;00:44:29,175;00:44:31,608;Don't knock it down while I'm gone.
566;00:44:31,710;00:44:33,644;I'll do my best.
567;00:44:39,051;00:44:41,185;Good luck.
568;00:45:12,318;00:45:14,851;Should we close the gate,
568;00:45:12,318;00:45:14,851;Lord Commander?
569;00:45:14,954;00:45:17,054;I'm not
569;00:45:14,954;00:45:17,054;the Lord Comman--
570;00:45:21,527;00:45:25,762;yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate.
571;00:45:37,743;00:45:39,509;We can go home now, Hodor.
572;00:45:39,612;00:45:42,179;Well, maybe not home home,
573;00:45:42,281;00:45:44,481;but somewhere that isn't a cave.
