2;00:02:27,481;00:02:28,648;Pod!
3;00:02:31,401;00:02:33,194;Find Bronn or Varys.
4;00:02:34,071;00:02:36,739;Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle.
5;00:02:37,324;00:02:39,909;Tell them I am very much alive.
6;00:02:40,369;00:02:41,494;Yes, my lord.
7;00:02:43,914;00:02:46,582;Would you like something for the pain?
8;00:02:48,585;00:02:50,002;What happened?
9;00:02:50,087;00:02:53,089;The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon
10;00:02:53,173;00:02:56,884;suffered a stunning defeat
10;00:02:53,173;00:02:56,884;at the hands of your father.
11;00:02:59,680;00:03:00,888;Where am I?
12;00:03:01,849;00:03:03,933;These are your new chambers.
13;00:03:04,852;00:03:08,771;A little cramped, perhaps,
13;00:03:04,852;00:03:08,771;but you don't need much room, do you?
14;00:03:10,482;00:03:12,984;You are no longer Hand of the King.
15;00:03:22,077;00:03:23,703;For your trouble.
16;00:03:47,978;00:03:51,105;I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon,
16;00:03:47,978;00:03:51,105;first of my name,
17;00:03:51,773;00:03:54,984;the rightful King of the Andals
17;00:03:51,773;00:03:54,984;and the First Men,
18;00:03:55,819;00:03:59,322;Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
18;00:03:55,819;00:03:59,322;and Protector of the Realm,
19;00:03:59,406;00:04:01,699;do hereby proclaim my grandfather,
20;00:04:01,783;00:04:06,746;Tywin Lannister, the savior of the city
20;00:04:01,783;00:04:06,746;and the Hand of the King.
21;00:04:20,177;00:04:21,510;Thank you, Your Grace.
22;00:04:32,064;00:04:34,482;Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward.
23;00:04:36,026;00:04:39,111;For your good service and ingenuity
24;00:04:39,196;00:04:41,822;in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell,
25;00:04:42,074;00:04:45,159;I declare that you shall be granted
25;00:04:42,074;00:04:45,159;the castle of Harrenhal
26;00:04:45,243;00:04:47,286;with all its attendant lands and incomes
27;00:04:47,913;00:04:52,333;to be held by your sons and grandsons
27;00:04:47,913;00:04:52,333;from this day until the end of time.
28;00:04:52,542;00:04:55,169;You honor me beyond words, Your Grace.
29;00:04:57,047;00:05:00,132;I shall have to acquire
29;00:04:57,047;00:05:00,132;some sons and grandsons.
30;00:05:04,680;00:05:06,305;Ser Loras Tyrell.
31;00:05:11,770;00:05:14,146;Your house has come to our aid.
32;00:05:14,564;00:05:17,525;The whole realm is in your debt,
32;00:05:14,564;00:05:17,525;none more so than I.
33;00:05:17,609;00:05:20,695;If your family would ask anything of me,
33;00:05:17,609;00:05:20,695;ask it,
34;00:05:21,154;00:05:23,030;and it shall be yours.
35;00:05:23,240;00:05:24,573;Your Grace,
36;00:05:25,826;00:05:28,995;my sister Margaery,
36;00:05:25,826;00:05:28,995;her husband was taken from us before...
37;00:05:31,456;00:05:32,623;She remains innocent.
38;00:05:33,750;00:05:36,419;I would ask you to find it in your heart
38;00:05:33,750;00:05:36,419;to do us the great honor
39;00:05:37,004;00:05:38,879;ofjoining our houses.
40;00:05:40,090;00:05:42,758;Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?
41;00:05:45,762;00:05:47,972;With all my heart, Your Grace.
42;00:05:48,974;00:05:51,392;I have come to love you from afar.
43;00:05:52,060;00:05:56,022;Tales of your courage and wisdom
43;00:05:52,060;00:05:56,022;have never been far from my ears.
44;00:05:56,940;00:06:00,901;And those tales have taken root
44;00:05:56,940;00:06:00,901;deep inside of me.
45;00:06:04,448;00:06:08,576;I, too, have heard tales
45;00:06:04,448;00:06:08,576;of your beauty and grace,
46;00:06:08,660;00:06:13,080;but the tales do not do you justice, my lady.
47;00:06:14,624;00:06:17,376;It would be an honor to return your love,
48;00:06:18,128;00:06:20,254;but I am promised to another.
49;00:06:22,132;00:06:23,716;A king must keep his word.
50;00:06:23,800;00:06:25,176;Your Grace,
51;00:06:25,385;00:06:29,889;in the judgment of your Small Council,
51;00:06:25,385;00:06:29,889;it would be neither proper nor wise
52;00:06:29,973;00:06:33,559;for you to wed the daughter
52;00:06:29,973;00:06:33,559;of a man beheaded for treason,
53;00:06:33,643;00:06:38,147;a girl whose brother is in open rebellion
53;00:06:33,643;00:06:38,147;against the throne as we speak.
54;00:06:38,982;00:06:42,568;For the good of the realm,
54;00:06:38,982;00:06:42,568;your councilors beg you
55;00:06:45,655;00:06:48,157;to set Sansa Stark aside.
56;00:06:50,619;00:06:52,328;Margaery!
56;00:06:50,619;00:06:52,328;We want Margaery!
57;00:06:56,833;00:07:00,753;I would like to heed your wishes
57;00:06:56,833;00:07:00,753;and the wishes of my people,
58;00:07:00,837;00:07:03,380;but I took a holy vow.
59;00:07:04,174;00:07:05,382;Your Grace,
60;00:07:06,051;00:07:09,178;the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn,
61;00:07:09,513;00:07:13,808;but your father, blessed be his memory,
62;00:07:14,601;00:07:20,022;made this pact before the Starks
62;00:07:14,601;00:07:20,022;revealed their falseness.
63;00:07:21,358;00:07:23,943;I have consulted with the High Septon
64;00:07:24,319;00:07:28,030;and he assures me
64;00:07:24,319;00:07:28,030;that their crimes against the realm
65;00:07:28,698;00:07:31,909;free you from any promise
65;00:07:28,698;00:07:31,909;you have made to them
66;00:07:32,619;00:07:35,454;in the sight of the gods.
67;00:07:37,332;00:07:38,999;The gods are good.
68;00:07:39,292;00:07:41,335;I am free to heed my heart.
69;00:07:42,170;00:07:45,214;Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister.
70;00:07:46,550;00:07:47,716;You will be my queen
71;00:07:49,219;00:07:53,389;and I will love you from this day
71;00:07:49,219;00:07:53,389;until my last day.
72;00:08:16,246;00:08:17,496;My lady.
73;00:08:19,124;00:08:21,125;My sincerest condolences.
74;00:08:22,377;00:08:24,170;They're right. I'm not good enough for him.
75;00:08:24,337;00:08:26,088;You shouldn't say that.
76;00:08:26,256;00:08:28,757;You'll be good enough for many things.
77;00:08:28,842;00:08:30,593;He'll still enjoy beating you.
78;00:08:31,344;00:08:33,429;And now that you're a woman,
79;00:08:33,930;00:08:37,183;he'll be able to enjoy you
79;00:08:33,930;00:08:37,183;in other ways as well.
80;00:08:37,267;00:08:39,727;But, if he's not marrying me...
81;00:08:39,895;00:08:41,770;He'll let you go home?
82;00:08:43,607;00:08:47,026;Joffrey's not the sort of boy
82;00:08:43,607;00:08:47,026;who gives away his toys.
83;00:08:47,819;00:08:52,198;You have a tender heart,
83;00:08:47,819;00:08:52,198;just like your mother did at your age.
84;00:08:52,282;00:08:54,783;I can see so much of her in you.
85;00:08:56,328;00:08:58,454;She was like a sister to me.
86;00:09:00,290;00:09:04,001;For her sake, I'll help get you home.
87;00:09:07,797;00:09:10,090;King's Landing is my home now.
88;00:09:12,093;00:09:13,677;Look around you.
89;00:09:14,471;00:09:16,263;We're all liars here.
90;00:09:17,641;00:09:20,351;And every one of us is better than you.
91;00:09:31,947;00:09:33,155;Come in.
92;00:09:34,991;00:09:36,200;Make yourself comfortable.
93;00:09:42,999;00:09:45,501;That doesn't look very comfortable.
94;00:09:46,336;00:09:48,754;Here, watch me.
95;00:09:53,009;00:09:55,678;No need for that, my dear.
95;00:09:53,009;00:09:55,678;You sure?
96;00:09:56,513;00:09:58,264;Most men like what they see.
97;00:09:58,348;00:10:00,140;I'm not like most men.
98;00:10:00,350;00:10:02,434;That's what most men say.
99;00:10:03,979;00:10:06,146;If you don't want what most men want,
100;00:10:06,231;00:10:09,608;then you'd better tell me
100;00:10:06,231;00:10:09,608;what you'd like me to do.
101;00:10:10,110;00:10:11,485;I would like you
102;00:10:11,569;00:10:15,906;to tell me if working for Lord Baelish
102;00:10:11,569;00:10:15,906;has been all you'd hoped it would be.
103;00:10:17,993;00:10:19,326;Have we met?
104;00:10:19,411;00:10:21,829;You wouldn't remember me if we had?
105;00:10:21,913;00:10:23,372;I meet a lot of men.
106;00:10:23,456;00:10:25,666;And I think you remember all of them.
107;00:10:26,418;00:10:29,378;I think your true talents are wasted on them.
108;00:10:29,879;00:10:31,880;You're very kind, my lord.
109;00:10:32,674;00:10:34,383;Allow me to return the favor.
110;00:10:41,725;00:10:43,225;You're afraid.
111;00:10:43,893;00:10:46,312;Why? Nothing dangerous down there.
112;00:10:47,605;00:10:48,897;I know who you are.
113;00:10:48,982;00:10:54,403;And, unlike your current employer,
113;00:10:48,982;00:10:54,403;I protect those who work for me.
114;00:10:55,196;00:10:59,783;I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims
114;00:10:55,196;00:10:59,783;or force them to abuse each other.
115;00:11:01,077;00:11:02,286;How do you know about that?
116;00:11:03,496;00:11:05,539;I thought you said you knew who I was.
117;00:11:07,751;00:11:09,585;What can I do for you, Lord Varys?
118;00:11:22,891;00:11:26,769;Littlefinger looks at you
118;00:11:22,891;00:11:26,769;and sees a collection of profitable holes.
119;00:11:27,937;00:11:29,980;I see a potential partner.
120;00:11:31,733;00:11:34,610;I'm afraid of him.
120;00:11:31,733;00:11:34,610;Oh, you should be.
121;00:11:36,112;00:11:37,905;He's a dangerous man.
122;00:11:39,115;00:11:41,533;But everyone has their weaknesses.
123;00:11:42,077;00:11:44,870;Your current employer hides his very well,
124;00:11:46,206;00:11:48,415;but not as well as he thinks.
125;00:11:52,879;00:11:54,963;You're a virgin, I take it?
126;00:11:55,298;00:11:56,382;Walk.
127;00:11:58,802;00:12:01,220;Childhood must have been awful for you.
128;00:12:01,304;00:12:04,139;Were you a foot taller than all the boys?
129;00:12:04,516;00:12:07,142;They laughed at you, called you names?
130;00:12:07,310;00:12:09,395;Some boys like a challenge.
131;00:12:09,813;00:12:12,898;One or two must have tried
131;00:12:09,813;00:12:12,898;to get inside Big Brienne.
132;00:12:12,982;00:12:14,650;One or two tried.
133;00:12:14,734;00:12:15,734;Ah.
134;00:12:16,361;00:12:18,237;But you fought them off.
135;00:12:18,321;00:12:20,239;But maybe you wished one of them could
136;00:12:20,323;00:12:23,700;overpower you, fling you down,
136;00:12:20,323;00:12:23,700;tear off your clothes.
137;00:12:24,244;00:12:26,245;But none of them were strong enough.
138;00:12:26,329;00:12:28,705;I'm strong enough.
138;00:12:26,329;00:12:28,705;Not interested.
139;00:12:28,790;00:12:32,668;Of course you are. You'd love to know
139;00:12:28,790;00:12:32,668;what it feels like to be a woman.
140;00:12:35,922;00:12:37,131;Ah.
141;00:12:37,215;00:12:39,174;They lay with lions.
142;00:12:39,342;00:12:41,176;Tavern girls, I'd say.
143;00:12:41,261;00:12:43,679;Probably served my father's soldiers.
144;00:12:44,222;00:12:47,182;Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel.
145;00:12:47,684;00:12:49,726;That's how they earned this.
146;00:12:50,353;00:12:53,689;The glorious work of
146;00:12:50,353;00:12:53,689;the Northern freedom fighters.
147;00:12:53,898;00:12:55,941;Must make you proud to serve the Starks.
148;00:12:56,025;00:12:58,026;I don't serve the Starks.
149;00:12:58,403;00:13:00,237;I serve Lady Catelyn.
150;00:13:00,363;00:13:03,699;Tell yourself that tonight
150;00:13:00,363;00:13:03,699;when they swing in your dreams.
151;00:13:07,537;00:13:09,705;What are you doing?
151;00:13:07,537;00:13:09,705;Burying them.
152;00:13:09,914;00:13:13,125;We shouldn't stay here.
152;00:13:09,914;00:13:13,125;We should get back on the river.
153;00:13:13,877;00:13:15,294;I think these women would understand if...
154;00:13:15,378;00:13:16,795;I don't care what you think.
155;00:13:17,380;00:13:19,298;I didn't leave it here. I had me dagger.
156;00:13:19,382;00:13:20,549;Untie me. Now!
157;00:13:20,633;00:13:23,469;I gave it to you to cut the rope,
157;00:13:20,633;00:13:23,469;and now I don't have me dagger no more.
158;00:13:23,553;00:13:26,096;So unless it got stuck in your arse
158;00:13:23,553;00:13:26,096;on its way to your cunt,
159;00:13:26,181;00:13:29,016;it stands to reason that it's gone. Whoa.
160;00:13:30,727;00:13:32,102;What's your business here?
161;00:13:32,896;00:13:34,062;Traveling a prisoner.
162;00:13:37,650;00:13:39,651;You're a woman.
162;00:13:37,650;00:13:39,651;A woman!
163;00:13:39,736;00:13:41,278;Well, fuck me!
164;00:13:42,572;00:13:44,781;If you've quite finished up...
165;00:13:47,577;00:13:50,162;All right, we'll be going.
165;00:13:47,577;00:13:50,162;Whoa. Whoa!
166;00:13:51,915;00:13:53,081;Who do you fight for?
167;00:13:54,334;00:13:55,709;The Starks.
168;00:13:57,378;00:13:58,921;What did he do?
169;00:14:00,465;00:14:04,510;Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?
169;00:14:00,465;00:14:04,510;No, stealing is a crime.
170;00:14:04,594;00:14:07,179;But it's not a crime to starve.
170;00:14:04,594;00:14:07,179;That's justice for you.
171;00:14:07,263;00:14:08,972;Where are you taking him?
171;00:14:07,263;00:14:08,972;To Riverrun.
172;00:14:09,265;00:14:10,849;Why Riverrun?
173;00:14:10,934;00:14:13,685;Steal from the Tullys,
173;00:14:10,934;00:14:13,685;it's their dungeons you rot in.
174;00:14:13,770;00:14:15,979;Why not kill him?
174;00:14:13,770;00:14:15,979;For stealing a pig?
175;00:14:16,731;00:14:18,315;I don't give the orders.
176;00:14:18,399;00:14:19,775;He must be important to someone.
177;00:14:19,859;00:14:22,694;Sending him with you?
177;00:14:19,859;00:14:22,694;How important could he be?
178;00:14:24,113;00:14:26,323;All right, have it your way,
179;00:14:27,408;00:14:28,617;my lady.
180;00:14:31,621;00:14:34,456;Do I know you?
180;00:14:31,621;00:14:34,456;Have you been to Ashemark?
181;00:14:35,083;00:14:37,209;No.
181;00:14:35,083;00:14:37,209;Then you don't know me.
182;00:14:37,627;00:14:40,295;Do you ever go to the river market
182;00:14:37,627;00:14:40,295;at Salt Rock?
183;00:14:40,421;00:14:42,673;Is it near Ashemark?
183;00:14:40,421;00:14:42,673;No.
184;00:14:43,132;00:14:44,341;I've never been there.
185;00:14:45,260;00:14:46,885;What do you think of these beauties?
186;00:14:48,972;00:14:50,514;I hope you gave them quick deaths.
187;00:14:51,391;00:14:53,392;Two of them we did, yeah.
188;00:14:55,645;00:14:56,770;Wait.
189;00:15:00,191;00:15:01,692;I do know you.
190;00:15:02,610;00:15:04,486;That's Jaime Lannister.
191;00:15:05,196;00:15:07,281;I wish someone had told me.
191;00:15:05,196;00:15:07,281;I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.
192;00:15:07,365;00:15:09,783;If this is the Kingslayer,
192;00:15:07,365;00:15:09,783;I think I'd know about it.
193;00:15:09,867;00:15:11,451;How do you know what
193;00:15:09,867;00:15:11,451;the Kingslayer looks like?
194;00:15:12,036;00:15:14,246;I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him.
195;00:15:14,330;00:15:16,748;They dragged him out of the woods
195;00:15:14,330;00:15:16,748;and threw him down before the king.
196;00:15:16,833;00:15:19,376;He's not the Kingslayer.
196;00:15:16,833;00:15:19,376;Sorry to disappoint you.
197;00:15:19,460;00:15:21,336;If he was, I'd only be traveling his head.
198;00:15:21,754;00:15:23,755;I have a question for you both.
199;00:15:23,840;00:15:26,174;And I want you to answer it at the same time.
200;00:15:26,259;00:15:28,468;I count to three, you both answer.
201;00:15:29,053;00:15:30,679;What's his name?
202;00:15:31,472;00:15:32,514;One.
203;00:15:33,600;00:15:35,767;Two. Three.
204;00:15:51,451;00:15:52,868;Two quick deaths.
205;00:16:21,064;00:16:22,898;Those were Stark men.
206;00:16:23,399;00:16:25,400;I don't serve the Starks.
207;00:16:26,361;00:16:28,153;I serve Lady Catelyn.
208;00:16:28,446;00:16:32,282;I told you I'd take you to King's Landing,
208;00:16:28,446;00:16:32,282;and that's what I'm going to do.
209;00:16:34,869;00:16:35,952;Stay.
210;00:16:54,263;00:16:57,015;Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.
211;00:16:57,600;00:16:58,809;I know that.
212;00:16:59,102;00:17:01,311;And you mean to do it anyway?
213;00:17:04,941;00:17:06,274;I love her.
214;00:17:07,360;00:17:09,361;I know that seems important to you.
215;00:17:09,445;00:17:11,071;It is important to me.
216;00:17:13,408;00:17:16,284;Your father didn't love me when we married.
217;00:17:16,911;00:17:19,121;He hardly knew me or I him.
218;00:17:21,249;00:17:23,834;Love didn't just happen to us.
219;00:17:25,211;00:17:27,629;We built it slowly over the years,
220;00:17:27,880;00:17:29,423;stone by stone,
221;00:17:29,799;00:17:33,260;for you, for your brothers and sisters,
221;00:17:29,799;00:17:33,260;for all of us.
222;00:17:35,221;00:17:38,598;It's not as exciting as
222;00:17:35,221;00:17:38,598;secret passion in the woods,
223;00:17:39,308;00:17:41,017;but it is stronger.
224;00:17:42,186;00:17:43,812;It lasts longer.
225;00:17:45,648;00:17:48,942;And that is what would be in store for me
225;00:17:45,648;00:17:48,942;with one of Walder Frey's daughters,
226;00:17:49,026;00:17:51,486;what you and father had?
226;00:17:49,026;00:17:51,486;Why not?
227;00:17:52,113;00:17:53,530;Because she's not beautiful?
228;00:17:53,614;00:17:55,490;Because she's not exotic and exciting?
229;00:17:55,658;00:17:58,493;Now you're arguing just to argue
229;00:17:55,658;00:17:58,493;because you arranged it.
230;00:17:58,619;00:18:00,412;And you agreed to it.
231;00:18:01,914;00:18:03,832;You gave him your word.
232;00:18:04,500;00:18:08,086;Treat your oaths recklessly,
232;00:18:04,500;00:18:08,086;and your people will do the same.
233;00:18:08,379;00:18:09,880;If your father lived his life for one thing...
234;00:18:09,964;00:18:11,631;My father is dead.
235;00:18:12,884;00:18:16,720;And the only parent I have left
235;00:18:12,884;00:18:16,720;has no right to call anyone reckless.
236;00:18:36,866;00:18:39,618;You said you saw my victory in the flames.
237;00:18:39,702;00:18:40,869;I did.
238;00:18:41,662;00:18:44,039;I still see it.
238;00:18:41,662;00:18:44,039;The flames lied.
239;00:18:45,208;00:18:47,417;And I'm no better than a savage
240;00:18:47,668;00:18:49,544;trusting in a fire god.
241;00:18:52,548;00:18:55,258;I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay.
242;00:18:55,718;00:18:58,720;I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell
243;00:18:59,055;00:19:01,765;as their brothers burned alive, and for what?
244;00:19:02,892;00:19:05,894;Attacked from behind
244;00:19:02,892;00:19:05,894;by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells.
245;00:19:05,978;00:19:07,896;If you see so much in your flames,
245;00:19:05,978;00:19:07,896;why didn't you warn me?
246;00:19:07,980;00:19:09,815;The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.
247;00:19:09,899;00:19:12,234;You claimed to speak for a god.
248;00:19:12,318;00:19:14,486;Will you quit the war
248;00:19:12,318;00:19:14,486;just because you've lost a battle?
249;00:19:14,570;00:19:16,905;You talk about war as if you understand it.
250;00:19:16,989;00:19:18,990;I've been fighting far longer than you.
251;00:19:19,075;00:19:20,242;Have you?
252;00:19:20,868;00:19:22,577;Show me how you fight.
253;00:19:26,082;00:19:27,290;Show me.
254;00:19:33,923;00:19:35,590;Where's your god now?
255;00:19:37,426;00:19:39,052;Will he save you?
256;00:19:40,596;00:19:42,264;Where is your god?
257;00:19:44,642;00:19:46,017;Inside you.
258;00:19:56,404;00:19:58,280;I murdered my brother.
259;00:20:06,664;00:20:08,290;We murdered him.
260;00:20:09,458;00:20:10,917;Share the weight with me.
261;00:20:11,002;00:20:12,919;He wasn't your brother.
262;00:20:18,134;00:20:20,135;This war has just begun.
263;00:20:20,469;00:20:22,345;It will last for years.
264;00:20:23,139;00:20:25,640;Thousands will die at your command.
265;00:20:27,310;00:20:29,811;You will betray the men serving you.
266;00:20:30,980;00:20:33,148;You will betray your family.
267;00:20:33,983;00:20:36,985;You will betray everything
267;00:20:33,983;00:20:36,985;you once held dear.
268;00:20:38,988;00:20:41,114;And it will all be worth it
269;00:20:41,824;00:20:44,910;because you are the Son of Fire.
270;00:20:44,994;00:20:47,412;You are the Warrior of Light.
271;00:20:49,957;00:20:53,168;You will sweep aside
271;00:20:49,957;00:20:53,168;this pretender and that one.
272;00:20:55,004;00:20:56,671;You will be king.
273;00:21:00,635;00:21:02,969;You promise these things,
274;00:21:04,722;00:21:06,473;but you don't know.
275;00:21:07,308;00:21:08,892;None of us know.
276;00:21:09,852;00:21:11,478;Let me show you.
277;00:21:20,905;00:21:23,031;Look into the fire, my king.
278;00:21:23,532;00:21:24,616;Look.
279;00:21:26,535;00:21:28,662;I see fire.
279;00:21:26,535;00:21:28,662;Keep looking.
280;00:21:37,254;00:21:38,630;Do you see?
281;00:21:40,508;00:21:42,258;Do you see, my king?
282;00:22:01,195;00:22:02,278;Yes.
283;00:22:13,499;00:22:15,291;I will kill that man.
284;00:22:16,752;00:22:19,170;I don't care how many arrows
284;00:22:16,752;00:22:19,170;they feather me with,
285;00:22:19,255;00:22:21,506;how many spears they run through me,
286;00:22:21,590;00:22:24,676;I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall.
287;00:22:25,386;00:22:28,013;They want you to know you're surrounded.
288;00:22:28,097;00:22:29,597;I know I'm surrounded.
289;00:22:29,932;00:22:32,308;I know that because
289;00:22:29,932;00:22:32,308;I stood on the battlements
290;00:22:32,393;00:22:34,394;and saw I was surrounded.
291;00:22:34,729;00:22:35,979;They don't want you to sleep.
292;00:22:36,355;00:22:37,939;They want to sap your spirit before...
293;00:22:38,024;00:22:40,150;Thank you, wise bald man.
294;00:22:41,944;00:22:44,904;Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me.
295;00:22:48,784;00:22:50,702;No word from my father?
296;00:22:52,455;00:22:53,496;No.
297;00:22:54,874;00:22:56,499;Send more ravens.
298;00:22:58,127;00:23:00,128;You killed all the ravens.
299;00:23:03,674;00:23:06,092;The first time I saw Winterfell...
300;00:23:11,891;00:23:14,017;First time I saw Winterfell,
301;00:23:15,519;00:23:19,606;it looked like something
301;00:23:15,519;00:23:19,606;that had been here for thousands of years
302;00:23:19,899;00:23:23,526;and would be here for thousands of years
302;00:23:19,899;00:23:23,526;after I was dead.
303;00:23:25,780;00:23:27,655;I saw it and I thought,
304;00:23:28,741;00:23:32,660;Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion
304;00:23:28,741;00:23:32,660;and killed my brothers.
305;00:23:34,371;00:23:36,456;We never stood a chance against
305;00:23:34,371;00:23:36,456;the man who lives here.
306;00:23:36,540;00:23:39,250;Lord Stark went out of his way
306;00:23:36,540;00:23:39,250;to make it your home.
307;00:23:39,335;00:23:44,005;Yes, my captors were so very kind to me.
307;00:23:39,335;00:23:44,005;You love reminding me of that.
308;00:23:45,841;00:23:50,386;Everyone in this frozen pile of shit
308;00:23:45,841;00:23:50,386;has always loved reminding me of that.
309;00:23:53,349;00:23:58,061;You know what it's like to be told
309;00:23:53,349;00:23:58,061;how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner?
310;00:23:59,605;00:24:02,023;To be told how much you owe them?
311;00:24:04,860;00:24:07,904;And then to go back home
311;00:24:04,860;00:24:07,904;to your real father...
312;00:24:12,034;00:24:13,368;I will kill that man.
313;00:24:13,452;00:24:14,911;I swear to the Drowned God,
314;00:24:15,037;00:24:16,496;the Old Gods, the New Gods,
315;00:24:16,580;00:24:20,708;to every fucking god
315;00:24:16,580;00:24:20,708;in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man.
316;00:24:20,793;00:24:22,544;Theon, listen to me.
317;00:24:23,879;00:24:25,547;I serve Winterfell.
318;00:24:26,382;00:24:28,341;Now Winterfell is yours.
319;00:24:28,926;00:24:31,219;I'm bound by oath to serve you.
320;00:24:31,554;00:24:33,972;And what's your counsel, trusted friend?
321;00:24:34,557;00:24:35,598;Run.
322;00:24:36,934;00:24:40,728;Five hundred Northmen
322;00:24:36,934;00:24:40,728;wait outside the walls. You have 20 men.
323;00:24:41,522;00:24:42,981;You can't win.
324;00:24:43,065;00:24:44,732;Wait for nightfall and run.
325;00:24:45,151;00:24:47,068;There's nowhere to run.
326;00:24:47,570;00:24:49,487;I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands.
327;00:24:49,572;00:24:54,868;And even if I did, even if by some miracle
327;00:24:49,572;00:24:54,868;I slipped through the lines and made it home,
328;00:24:55,411;00:24:56,995;I'd be a coward.
329;00:24:57,746;00:24:59,497;The Greyjoy who ran.
330;00:25:01,750;00:25:03,710;The shame of the family.
331;00:25:05,838;00:25:07,338;Don't go home.
332;00:25:08,883;00:25:10,758;Join the Night's Watch.
333;00:25:13,220;00:25:15,597;Once a man has taken the black,
334;00:25:17,516;00:25:19,726;he's beyond reach of the law.
335;00:25:20,895;00:25:23,271;All his past crimes are forgiven.
336;00:25:25,649;00:25:27,775;I won't make it to the Wall.
337;00:25:27,943;00:25:31,029;I won't make it 10 feet past
337;00:25:27,943;00:25:31,029;the Winterfell gates.
338;00:25:31,113;00:25:32,655;There are ways.
339;00:25:33,490;00:25:37,493;Hidden passageways built
339;00:25:33,490;00:25:37,493;so the Lords of Winterfell could escape.
340;00:25:38,871;00:25:40,955;The road will be dangerous.
341;00:25:43,417;00:25:45,418;But with a little luck...
342;00:25:48,714;00:25:52,467;The Night's Watch
342;00:25:48,714;00:25:52,467;is an ancient, honorable order.
343;00:25:54,511;00:25:56,846;You'll have opportunities there.
344;00:25:58,307;00:26:01,976;The opportunity for Jon Snow
344;00:25:58,307;00:26:01,976;to cut my throat in my sleep.
345;00:26:02,853;00:26:06,147;The opportunity to make amends
345;00:26:02,853;00:26:06,147;for what you've done.
346;00:26:08,776;00:26:10,860;I've done a lot, haven't I?
347;00:26:12,321;00:26:14,906;Things I never imagined myself doing.
348;00:26:17,493;00:26:20,578;I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy.
349;00:26:23,499;00:26:26,376;You're not the man you're pretending to be.
350;00:26:29,046;00:26:30,296;Not yet.
351;00:26:34,468;00:26:36,094;You may be right.
352;00:26:39,265;00:26:42,642;But I've gone too far
352;00:26:39,265;00:26:42,642;to pretend to be anything else.
353;00:26:51,819;00:26:53,319;You hear that?
354;00:26:54,738;00:26:57,490;That's the mating call of the Northmen.
355;00:26:58,075;00:26:59,450;They want to fuck us.
356;00:27:01,161;00:27:04,414;Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks.
356;00:27:01,161;00:27:04,414;I'm ready for one.
357;00:27:06,041;00:27:09,419;They say every ironborn man
357;00:27:06,041;00:27:09,419;is worth a dozen from the mainland.
358;00:27:09,503;00:27:10,545;Aye!
359;00:27:11,547;00:27:13,756;You think they're right?
359;00:27:11,547;00:27:13,756;Aye.
360;00:27:15,968;00:27:17,885;We die today, brothers.
361;00:27:19,221;00:27:22,140;We die bleeding from 100 wounds
362;00:27:22,224;00:27:25,893;with arrows in our necks
362;00:27:22,224;00:27:25,893;and spears in our guts,
363;00:27:27,062;00:27:30,064;but our war cries will echo through eternity.
364;00:27:31,275;00:27:33,901;They will sing about the battle of Winterfell
365;00:27:33,986;00:27:36,738;until the Iron Islands
365;00:27:33,986;00:27:36,738;have slipped beneath the waves.
366;00:27:37,072;00:27:40,783;Every man, woman
366;00:27:37,072;00:27:40,783;and child will know who we were
367;00:27:40,868;00:27:42,744;and how long we stood.
368;00:27:43,871;00:27:45,496;Aggar and Gelmarr,
369;00:27:45,581;00:27:46,998;Wex and Urzen,
370;00:27:47,082;00:27:49,000;Stygg and Black Lorren.
371;00:27:49,168;00:27:52,378;Ironborn warriors will cry out our names
372;00:27:52,546;00:27:55,882;as they leap onto the shores
372;00:27:52,546;00:27:55,882;of Seagard and Faircastle.
373;00:27:55,966;00:27:57,091;Aye!
374;00:27:57,259;00:27:59,719;Mothers will name their sons for us.
374;00:27:57,259;00:27:59,719;Aye!
375;00:27:59,803;00:28:02,722;Girls will think of us
375;00:27:59,803;00:28:02,722;with their lovers inside them.
376;00:28:02,806;00:28:03,806;Aye!
377;00:28:04,016;00:28:09,312;And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower
377;00:28:04,016;00:28:09,312;will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke!
378;00:28:09,438;00:28:10,521;Aye!
379;00:28:10,606;00:28:14,233;What is dead may never die!
379;00:28:10,606;00:28:14,233;What is dead may never die!
380;00:28:19,073;00:28:20,573;Thought he'd never shut up.
381;00:28:21,909;00:28:24,494;It was a good speech. Didn't want to interrupt.
382;00:28:28,374;00:28:29,832;What is this?
383;00:28:30,292;00:28:31,501;What are you doing?
384;00:28:38,008;00:28:39,509;Let's go home.
385;00:28:42,471;00:28:43,721;Come on.
386;00:28:53,148;00:28:54,482;Why should I believe you?
387;00:28:54,566;00:28:56,401;Why would I lie about it?
388;00:28:56,485;00:28:58,486;To create strife between my sister and me.
389;00:28:58,570;00:29:01,322;Where before there was nothing but love.
390;00:29:02,282;00:29:05,993;Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you
390;00:29:02,282;00:29:05,993;on your sister's orders.
391;00:29:06,829;00:29:10,164;If it weren't for your squire's bravery,
391;00:29:06,829;00:29:10,164;you'd be a dead man.
392;00:29:11,792;00:29:14,168;Pod.
392;00:29:11,792;00:29:14,168;Yes, my lord?
393;00:29:15,337;00:29:20,174;Would it be excessive of me to ask you
393;00:29:15,337;00:29:20,174;to save my life twice in a week?
394;00:29:21,802;00:29:24,137;No, my lord.
394;00:29:21,802;00:29:24,137;You're a good lad.
395;00:29:25,389;00:29:26,722;Get Bronn, tell him
396;00:29:26,807;00:29:30,059;I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks
396;00:29:26,807;00:29:30,059;outside my door at all times.
397;00:29:30,185;00:29:33,813;I'm afraid your friend has been relieved
397;00:29:30,185;00:29:33,813;of his command of the City Watch.
398;00:29:35,023;00:29:39,652;The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands
398;00:29:35,023;00:29:39,652;of your father or your sister.
399;00:29:40,737;00:29:42,989;It varies from cloak to cloak.
400;00:29:43,365;00:29:45,908;Then my hill tribesmen.
400;00:29:43,365;00:29:45,908;Have gone home.
401;00:29:47,077;00:29:49,787;Your father paid them quite handsomely.
402;00:29:52,624;00:29:56,919;I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other
402;00:29:52,624;00:29:56,919;for some time, my lord.
403;00:29:58,338;00:30:01,382;Don't want to swim too close
403;00:29:58,338;00:30:01,382;to a drowning man?
404;00:30:02,259;00:30:04,594;And I thought we were friends.
405;00:30:04,720;00:30:05,928;We are.
406;00:30:07,055;00:30:09,056;Podrick, would you mind?
407;00:30:25,240;00:30:29,952;There are many who know that without you
407;00:30:25,240;00:30:29,952;this city faced certain defeat.
408;00:30:31,205;00:30:33,331;The king won't give you any honors,
409;00:30:33,415;00:30:35,583;the histories won't mention you,
410;00:30:36,877;00:30:38,753;but we will not forget.
411;00:30:41,465;00:30:42,673;Come along now, Podrick.
412;00:30:47,721;00:30:48,930;My love.
413;00:30:50,057;00:30:51,849;It was good of you to come.
414;00:30:51,934;00:30:54,143;Good of me? Of course I come.
415;00:30:59,191;00:31:02,026;I want to see you.
415;00:30:59,191;00:31:02,026;Believe me, you don't.
416;00:31:02,653;00:31:04,278;Have you looked?
417;00:31:05,739;00:31:07,156;I will be the first.
418;00:31:31,682;00:31:32,807;Well?
419;00:31:34,643;00:31:35,977;You are a mess.
420;00:31:38,230;00:31:40,523;I'm a monster as well as a dwarf.
421;00:31:40,983;00:31:43,985;You should charge me double.
421;00:31:40,983;00:31:43,985;You think I'm here for money?
422;00:31:44,069;00:31:45,903;That was the arrangement we made.
423;00:31:46,530;00:31:48,614;I pay you and you lie to me.
424;00:31:48,699;00:31:49,699;Oh.
425;00:31:50,242;00:31:52,577;I'm a poor little rich man
425;00:31:50,242;00:31:52,577;and nobody loves me,
426;00:31:52,661;00:31:55,413;so I make jokes all the time
426;00:31:52,661;00:31:55,413;and pay them to laugh.
427;00:31:55,581;00:31:57,164;Fuck your money.
428;00:31:58,750;00:32:00,251;Let's leave.
428;00:31:58,750;00:32:00,251;Leave?
429;00:32:00,419;00:32:04,171;Leave King's Landing. They tried to kill you.
429;00:32:00,419;00:32:04,171;They will try again.
430;00:32:04,256;00:32:07,675;Going into wars, fighting soldiers,
430;00:32:04,256;00:32:07,675;you're terrible at this.
431;00:32:09,595;00:32:12,263;Let's take a boat to Pentos
431;00:32:09,595;00:32:12,263;and never come back.
432;00:32:12,347;00:32:15,433;You don't belong here.
432;00:32:12,347;00:32:15,433;What would we do in Pentos?
433;00:32:15,684;00:32:17,643;Eat, drink,
434;00:32:18,770;00:32:20,146;fuck, live.
435;00:32:24,985;00:32:26,861;I want to go with you.
436;00:32:27,154;00:32:28,404;So do it.
437;00:32:28,488;00:32:32,658;Your father, your sister, all these bad people,
437;00:32:28,488;00:32:32,658;they can't stop you.
438;00:32:32,909;00:32:35,244;Forget about them. Come with me.
439;00:32:37,748;00:32:38,998;I can't.
440;00:32:40,500;00:32:42,126;I do belong here.
441;00:32:43,378;00:32:46,672;These bad people are what I'm good at.
442;00:32:47,007;00:32:48,799;Outtalking them, outthinking them.
443;00:32:49,676;00:32:51,218;It's what I am.
444;00:32:53,221;00:32:54,722;And I like it.
445;00:32:56,391;00:32:59,310;I like it more than anything I've ever done.
446;00:33:04,358;00:33:06,233;Are you going to leave?
447;00:33:12,574;00:33:14,450;You have a shit memory.
448;00:33:17,245;00:33:19,497;I am yours and you are mine.
449;00:33:32,094;00:33:34,095;In the sight of the Seven,
450;00:33:34,346;00:33:37,556;I hereby seal these two souls,
451;00:33:38,934;00:33:42,937;binding them as one for eternity.
452;00:33:46,942;00:33:48,776;Look upon one another
453;00:33:49,653;00:33:51,320;and say the words.
454;00:33:55,409;00:33:57,118;Father, smith...
454;00:33:55,409;00:33:57,118;Father, smith...
455;00:33:57,285;00:33:58,994;warrior, mother...
455;00:33:57,285;00:33:58,994;warrior, mother...
456;00:33:59,287;00:34:02,039;maiden, crone, stranger.
456;00:33:59,287;00:34:02,039;maiden, crone, stranger.
457;00:34:02,958;00:34:05,543;I am hers and she is mine...
457;00:34:02,958;00:34:05,543;I am his and he is mine...
458;00:34:05,627;00:34:09,213;from this day until the end of my days.
458;00:34:05,627;00:34:09,213;from this day until the end of my days.
459;00:34:33,321;00:34:37,825;A house of ghosts, Khaleesi. It is known.
460;00:34:53,842;00:34:55,718;Where are the guards?
461;00:34:55,802;00:35:01,348;No guards.
461;00:34:55,802;00:35:01,348;The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel.
462;00:35:02,142;00:35:04,560;Let them try.
463;00:35:17,657;00:35:19,283;Is this a riddle?
464;00:35:59,574;00:36:04,245;Khaleesi!
465;00:36:07,457;00:36:08,749;Khaleesi!
466;00:36:12,921;00:36:16,006;Are you trying to frighten me
466;00:36:12,921;00:36:16,006;with magic tricks?
467;00:36:16,383;00:36:20,386;You want me? Here I am.
467;00:36:16,383;00:36:20,386;Are you afraid of a little girl?
468;00:36:45,328;00:36:46,996;How did he find us?
469;00:37:11,855;00:37:14,690;What are you doing here?
469;00:37:11,855;00:37:14,690;Waiting for you.
470;00:37:15,442;00:37:17,943;How did you know we'd come this way?
471;00:37:18,069;00:37:21,614;After all the things you have seen,
471;00:37:18,069;00:37:21,614;this is your question?
472;00:37:21,865;00:37:24,116;How did you kill those guards?
473;00:37:24,659;00:37:26,076;Was it hard?
474;00:37:26,912;00:37:29,580;No harder than taking a new name,
474;00:37:26,912;00:37:29,580;if you know the way.
475;00:37:29,664;00:37:31,081;Show me how.
476;00:37:31,833;00:37:35,502;I want to be able to do it, too.
476;00:37:31,833;00:37:35,502;If you would learn, you must come with me.
477;00:37:35,837;00:37:37,004;Where?
478;00:37:37,130;00:37:40,090;Far and away across
478;00:37:37,130;00:37:40,090;the Narrow Sea to Braavos.
479;00:37:41,009;00:37:42,927;My dancing master was from Braavos.
480;00:37:43,678;00:37:47,973;To be a dancing master is a special thing,
480;00:37:43,678;00:37:47,973;but to be a faceless man,
481;00:37:48,642;00:37:50,017;that is something else entirely.
482;00:37:51,478;00:37:53,604;The girl has many names on her lips.
483;00:37:53,688;00:37:56,106;Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister,
484;00:37:56,441;00:37:58,317;llyn Payne, the Hound.
485;00:37:58,735;00:38:01,153;Names to offer up to the Red God.
486;00:38:02,364;00:38:05,532;She could offer them all one by one.
487;00:38:08,370;00:38:09,703;I want to.
488;00:38:12,874;00:38:14,249;But I can't.
489;00:38:15,377;00:38:18,003;I need to find my brother and mother.
490;00:38:19,464;00:38:20,965;And my sister.
491;00:38:22,801;00:38:24,760;I need to find her, too.
492;00:38:26,054;00:38:27,721;Then we must part.
493;00:38:28,098;00:38:30,099;A man has duties as well.
494;00:38:30,767;00:38:32,643;Here.
494;00:38:30,767;00:38:32,643;What is it?
495;00:38:34,104;00:38:35,980;A coin of great value.
496;00:38:37,607;00:38:39,400;Could it buy a horse?
497;00:38:39,567;00:38:42,361;It is not meant for the buying of horses.
498;00:38:42,612;00:38:44,321;Then what good is it?
499;00:38:44,406;00:38:46,699;If the day comes
499;00:38:44,406;00:38:46,699;when you must find me again,
500;00:38:46,783;00:38:50,119;just give that coin to any man from Braavos
500;00:38:46,783;00:38:50,119;and say these words to him,
501;00:38:50,912;00:38:52,496;Valar Morghulis.
502;00:38:53,415;00:38:55,040;Valar Morghulis.
503;00:38:59,212;00:39:00,838;Please don't go, Jaqen.
504;00:39:04,551;00:39:06,051;Jaqen is dead.
505;00:39:06,970;00:39:09,263;Say it again. Valar Morghulis.
506;00:39:10,056;00:39:11,640;Valar Morghulis.
507;00:39:13,309;00:39:14,435;Good.
508;00:39:21,776;00:39:23,569;Farewell, Arya Stark.
509;00:39:48,303;00:39:50,971;Osha, what are you doing?
510;00:41:15,557;00:41:17,266;Tell us what medicine
510;00:41:15,557;00:41:17,266;to get from your chambers.
511;00:41:17,433;00:41:20,227;We'll make you better.
511;00:41:17,433;00:41:20,227;I feel just fine.
512;00:41:23,898;00:41:26,984;They burned it down. They burned everything.
513;00:41:27,068;00:41:29,736;Not everything. Not you.
514;00:41:33,408;00:41:35,367;But they may come back. You have to go.
515;00:41:35,910;00:41:37,369;Put on your warmest clothes.
516;00:41:37,453;00:41:39,705;Pack as much food as you can carry
516;00:41:37,453;00:41:39,705;and go north.
517;00:41:39,789;00:41:41,665;North's the wrong way.
518;00:41:42,000;00:41:43,709;And Mother and brother are south.
519;00:41:43,793;00:41:45,586;We don't know where.
520;00:41:45,837;00:41:48,589;There are too many enemies in the south.
521;00:41:48,840;00:41:50,716;Go to the Wall, to Jon.
522;00:41:50,925;00:41:53,594;He'll look after you
522;00:41:50,925;00:41:53,594;and let your mother know you're safe.
523;00:41:53,678;00:41:55,721;I don't want to leave you.
524;00:41:56,681;00:41:59,099;No more than I want to leave you.
525;00:42:00,101;00:42:01,435;I pulled you into the world.
526;00:42:03,271;00:42:04,354;Both of you.
527;00:42:05,190;00:42:08,108;I've seen both your faces
527;00:42:05,190;00:42:08,108;almost every day since.
528;00:42:08,193;00:42:10,777;And for that, I consider myself very,
529;00:42:11,696;00:42:13,071;very lucky.
530;00:42:14,699;00:42:16,825;Go now with Hodor. Go on.
531;00:42:17,911;00:42:19,620;I'll be right here.
532;00:42:27,462;00:42:28,545;Osha.
533;00:42:29,797;00:42:31,673;You must protect them.
534;00:42:32,008;00:42:34,134;You're the only one who can.
535;00:42:36,846;00:42:40,015;You may have to protect them
535;00:42:36,846;00:42:40,015;against your own kind.
536;00:42:40,099;00:42:42,517;I've got no great love for my own kind.
537;00:42:45,855;00:42:48,148;I'll get you milk of the poppy.
538;00:42:48,483;00:42:51,985;Tell me where to find it.
538;00:42:48,483;00:42:51,985;I don't want milk of the poppy.
539;00:43:02,580;00:43:03,872;Do it quickly.
540;00:47:05,239;00:47:06,823;Moon of my life.
541;00:47:17,502;00:47:21,588;This is dark magic, like the magic
541;00:47:17,502;00:47:21,588;that took you from me.
542;00:47:22,548;00:47:25,467;Took you from me before I could even...
543;00:47:27,595;00:47:31,389;Maybe I am dead and I just don't know it yet.
544;00:47:31,474;00:47:34,768;Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands.
545;00:47:34,894;00:47:39,564;Or maybe I refused to enter the Night Lands
545;00:47:34,894;00:47:39,564;without you.
546;00:47:39,649;00:47:45,946;Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck
546;00:47:39,649;00:47:45,946;himself and came back here to wait for you.
547;00:47:46,614;00:47:49,533;That sounds like something you would do.
548;00:47:59,085;00:48:04,589;Or maybe it is a dream.
548;00:47:59,085;00:48:04,589;Your dream, my dream...
549;00:48:04,674;00:48:06,466;...I do not know.
550;00:48:08,261;00:48:11,596;These are questions
550;00:48:08,261;00:48:11,596;for wise men with skinny arms.
551;00:48:14,141;00:48:17,018;You are the moon of my life.
552;00:48:17,103;00:48:19,896;That is all I know...
553;00:48:19,981;00:48:22,983;...and all I need to know.
554;00:48:25,278;00:48:27,654;And if this is a dream...
555;00:48:28,489;00:48:32,784;...I will kill the man who tries to wake me.
556;00:48:56,684;00:49:00,186;Until the sun rises in the west
556;00:48:56,684;00:49:00,186;and sets in the east,
557;00:49:02,857;00:49:04,858;until the rivers run dry
558;00:49:05,651;00:49:08,695;and the mountains blow
558;00:49:05,651;00:49:08,695;in the wind like leaves.
559;00:49:50,404;00:49:52,322;They miss their mother.
560;00:49:53,658;00:49:55,200;They want to be with you.
561;00:49:55,284;00:49:57,118;Do you want to be with them?
562;00:49:57,203;00:49:58,578;You will be.
563;00:50:00,081;00:50:03,667;When your dragons were born,
563;00:50:00,081;00:50:03,667;our magic was born again.
564;00:50:04,168;00:50:05,669;It is strongest in their presence.
565;00:50:06,587;00:50:08,922;And they are strongest in yours.
566;00:50:10,216;00:50:12,092;You will be with them,
567;00:50:12,927;00:50:15,011;through winter, summer,
568;00:50:15,971;00:50:17,597;winter again.
569;00:50:18,349;00:50:20,850;Across a thousand, thousand seasons
570;00:50:21,102;00:50:22,686;you will be with them.
571;00:50:22,770;00:50:25,897;And we will be with you
571;00:50:22,770;00:50:25,897;until time comes to an end.
572;00:50:31,904;00:50:34,781;Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn.
573;00:50:35,658;00:50:37,283;This is not my home.
574;00:50:37,368;00:50:40,787;My home is across the sea,
574;00:50:37,368;00:50:40,787;where my people are waiting for me.
575;00:50:41,122;00:50:42,997;They will be waiting a long time.
576;00:51:00,975;00:51:02,267;Dracarys.
577;00:51:50,858;00:51:53,109;We should be there by sundown.
578;00:51:53,694;00:51:57,697;Won't be a fun night for you.
578;00:51:53,694;00:51:57,697;Mance knows how to make crows sing.
579;00:52:00,451;00:52:03,745;If you know what to say,
579;00:52:00,451;00:52:03,745;you might just make it through the night.
580;00:52:06,540;00:52:09,042;Not talking's not the way to go.
581;00:52:10,878;00:52:12,420;Careful with that.
582;00:52:12,505;00:52:14,380;You might cut yourself.
583;00:52:15,508;00:52:17,425;Never swung a sword before, have you?
584;00:52:17,510;00:52:19,052;You look like a baby with a rattle.
585;00:52:19,261;00:52:20,345;Enough of that!
586;00:52:31,148;00:52:32,857;Stop!
586;00:52:31,148;00:52:32,857;Why, traitor?
587;00:52:33,234;00:52:36,402;So you can give Mance Rayder
587;00:52:33,234;00:52:36,402;an invitation to Castle Black?
588;00:52:36,487;00:52:37,654;Let 'em fight.
589;00:52:58,259;00:53:00,885;That's it? That's what you can do?
590;00:53:01,428;00:53:02,929;You little shit.
591;00:53:08,352;00:53:10,061;Your traitor father teach you that?
592;00:53:13,941;00:53:15,775;Or was it your whore mother?
593;00:53:34,336;00:53:37,505;We are the watchers on the Wall.
594;00:53:50,769;00:53:52,437;You can tell Mance
595;00:53:53,564;00:53:56,149;that's the man who killed Qhorin Halfhand.
596;00:54:10,581;00:54:12,540;Burn the body.
596;00:54:10,581;00:54:12,540;Aye.
597;00:54:12,708;00:54:15,668;You don't want this one coming back for you.
598;00:54:29,058;00:54:30,808;Come along, Jon Snow.
599;00:54:57,002;00:54:59,629;Time to meet the King-beyond-the-Wall.
600;00:55:46,343;00:55:47,719;What the...
601;00:55:54,518;00:55:55,977;Khaleesi, please.
602;00:55:56,395;00:55:58,146;He said you'd never leave Qarth alive.
603;00:55:58,230;00:55:59,272;Come.
604;00:56:31,096;00:56:32,305;Nothing.
605;00:56:40,439;00:56:43,149;Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.
606;00:56:44,026;00:56:46,360;Thank you for teaching me this lesson.
607;00:56:49,573;00:56:52,825;I am king of Qarth.
607;00:56:49,573;00:56:52,825;I can help you now, truly help you.
608;00:56:53,452;00:56:54,786;We can take the Iron Throne.
609;00:56:54,870;00:56:57,246;I'll bring you a thousand ships.
609;00:56:54,870;00:56:57,246;Please, Khaleesi, I beg you.
610;00:56:57,331;00:56:59,248;All that you have dreamed
610;00:56:57,331;00:56:59,248;is within your reach!
611;00:56:59,333;00:57:01,000;I beg you, please!
612;00:57:02,544;00:57:04,962;Khaleesi.
612;00:57:02,544;00:57:04,962;Please! Please!
613;00:57:05,047;00:57:06,881;Khaleesi!
614;00:57:27,111;00:57:28,653;It's all a lie.
615;00:57:30,030;00:57:32,031;Looks real enough to me.
616;00:57:36,662;00:57:38,704;Real enough to buy a ship?
617;00:57:40,082;00:57:42,708;Aye, a small ship.
618;00:57:48,674;00:57:53,136;Take all the gold and jewels.
619;00:58:27,045;00:58:30,256;I thought we were coming north
619;00:58:27,045;00:58:30,256;to fight wildlings.
620;00:58:33,260;00:58:34,719;Is this goat?
621;00:58:35,554;00:58:36,846;It's moose.
622;00:58:38,140;00:58:41,017;People shouldn't live anywhere
622;00:58:38,140;00:58:41,017;you need to burn shit to keep warm.
