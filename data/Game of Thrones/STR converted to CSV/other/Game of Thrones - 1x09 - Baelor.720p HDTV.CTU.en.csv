3;00:02:07,232;00:02:09,499;You've seen
3;00:02:07,232;00:02:09,499;better days, My Lord.
4;00:02:10,368;00:02:12,803;Another visit?
5;00:02:14,171;00:02:16,572;It seems
5;00:02:14,171;00:02:16,572;you're my last friend.
6;00:02:16,607;00:02:19,375;No no,
6;00:02:16,607;00:02:19,375;many still love you.
7;00:02:19,409;00:02:22,677;Sansa came to court
7;00:02:19,409;00:02:22,677;this morning
8;00:02:22,712;00:02:24,846;to plead for your life.
9;00:02:26,048;00:02:28,649;On her knees,
9;00:02:26,048;00:02:28,649;begging for me, hmmm.
10;00:02:28,683;00:02:30,651;Did you laugh
10;00:02:28,683;00:02:30,651;with the others?
11;00:02:30,685;00:02:32,486;You do me wrong, My Lord.
12;00:02:32,520;00:02:34,721;Your blood is
12;00:02:32,520;00:02:34,721;the last thing I want.
13;00:02:34,755;00:02:36,556;I don't know
13;00:02:34,755;00:02:36,556;what you want.
14;00:02:36,590;00:02:38,524;I've given up
14;00:02:36,590;00:02:38,524;trying to guess.
15;00:02:41,861;00:02:43,996;When I was still a boy--
16;00:02:44,064;00:02:47,233;before they cut my balls off
16;00:02:44,064;00:02:47,233;with a hot knife--
17;00:02:47,267;00:02:51,570;I traveled with a group
17;00:02:47,267;00:02:51,570;of actors through the free cities.
18;00:02:53,140;00:02:56,141;They taught me that
18;00:02:53,140;00:02:56,141;each man has a role to play.
19;00:02:56,176;00:02:59,077;The same is true
19;00:02:56,176;00:02:59,077;at court.
20;00:02:59,112;00:03:01,446;I am the master
20;00:02:59,112;00:03:01,446;of whisperers.
21;00:03:01,480;00:03:05,349;My role is to be sly, obsequious
21;00:03:01,480;00:03:05,349;and without scruples.
22;00:03:05,384;00:03:07,785;I'm a good actor,
22;00:03:05,384;00:03:07,785;My Lord.
23;00:03:07,819;00:03:11,321;Huh.
23;00:03:07,819;00:03:11,321;Can you free me from this pit?
24;00:03:11,355;00:03:13,088;I could.
25;00:03:13,123;00:03:14,756;But will I?
26;00:03:14,790;00:03:17,424;No.
27;00:03:17,459;00:03:19,292;As I said,
27;00:03:17,459;00:03:19,292;I'm no hero.
28;00:03:19,327;00:03:21,360;What do you want?
28;00:03:19,327;00:03:21,360;Tell me.
29;00:03:21,394;00:03:24,361;No riddles, no stories--
29;00:03:21,394;00:03:24,361;tell me, what do you want?
30;00:03:25,996;00:03:28,063;Peace.
31;00:03:28,097;00:03:30,898;Did you know that
31;00:03:28,097;00:03:30,898;your son is marching south
32;00:03:30,932;00:03:34,000;with an army of Northmen?
32;00:03:30,932;00:03:34,000;Loyal lad--
33;00:03:34,035;00:03:36,670;fighting for
33;00:03:34,035;00:03:36,670;his father's freedom.
34;00:03:36,704;00:03:38,938;Robb?
35;00:03:38,972;00:03:40,972;He's just a boy.
36;00:03:41,007;00:03:43,441;Boys have been
36;00:03:41,007;00:03:43,441;conquerors before.
37;00:03:43,475;00:03:45,776;But the man giving Cersei
37;00:03:43,475;00:03:45,776;sleepless nights
38;00:03:45,811;00:03:49,379;is the King's--
38;00:03:45,811;00:03:49,379;the late King's brother.
39;00:03:49,413;00:03:52,882;Lord Stannis has the best
39;00:03:49,413;00:03:52,882;claim to the Throne,
40;00:03:52,916;00:03:56,118;he is a proven battle commander
40;00:03:52,916;00:03:56,118;and he is utterly without mercy.
41;00:03:56,152;00:03:58,286;Stannis Baratheon
41;00:03:56,152;00:03:58,286;is Robert's true heir.
42;00:03:58,320;00:04:00,588;The Throne
42;00:03:58,320;00:04:00,588;is his by rights.
43;00:04:00,622;00:04:05,158;Tsk tsk. Sansa pleaded
43;00:04:00,622;00:04:05,158;so sweetly for your life,
44;00:04:05,192;00:04:07,427;it would be a shame
44;00:04:05,192;00:04:07,427;to throw it away.
45;00:04:07,461;00:04:10,196;Cersei is no fool.
46;00:04:10,231;00:04:14,233;She knows a tame wolf is more
46;00:04:10,231;00:04:14,233;use to her than a dead one.
47;00:04:14,300;00:04:17,035;You want me to serve the
47;00:04:14,300;00:04:17,035;woman who murdered my King,
48;00:04:17,069;00:04:19,804;who butchered my men,
48;00:04:17,069;00:04:19,804;who crippled my son?
49;00:04:19,839;00:04:21,907;I want you
49;00:04:19,839;00:04:21,907;to serve the realm!
50;00:04:21,941;00:04:24,677;Tell the Queen you will confess
50;00:04:21,941;00:04:24,677;your vile treason,
51;00:04:24,712;00:04:26,980;tell your son
51;00:04:24,712;00:04:26,980;to lay down his sword
52;00:04:27,015;00:04:30,284;and proclaim Joffrey
52;00:04:27,015;00:04:30,284;as the true heir.
53;00:04:32,187;00:04:35,189;Cersei knows you
53;00:04:32,187;00:04:35,189;as a man of honor.
54;00:04:35,223;00:04:37,291;If you give her
54;00:04:35,223;00:04:37,291;the peace she needs
55;00:04:37,326;00:04:40,194;and promise to carry
55;00:04:37,326;00:04:40,194;her secret to your grave,
56;00:04:40,228;00:04:44,030;I believe she will allow you to take
56;00:04:40,228;00:04:44,030;the Black and live out your days
57;00:04:44,064;00:04:46,498;on the Wall with your brother
57;00:04:44,064;00:04:46,498;and your bastard son.
58;00:04:47,834;00:04:50,601;You think my life is
58;00:04:47,834;00:04:50,601;some precious thing to me?
59;00:04:52,037;00:04:55,439;That I would trade my honor
59;00:04:52,037;00:04:55,439;for a few more years of...
60;00:04:55,474;00:04:57,241;Of what?
61;00:05:02,079;00:05:04,114;You grew up with actors.
62;00:05:05,649;00:05:09,418;You learned their craft
62;00:05:05,649;00:05:09,418;and you learned it well.
63;00:05:09,452;00:05:12,053;But I grew up
63;00:05:09,452;00:05:12,053;with soldiers.
64;00:05:13,989;00:05:17,224;I learned how to die
64;00:05:13,989;00:05:17,224;a long time ago.
65;00:05:19,594;00:05:22,028;Pity.
66;00:05:22,063;00:05:24,330;Such a pity.
67;00:05:31,003;00:05:33,438;What of your
67;00:05:31,003;00:05:33,438;daughter's life, My Lord?
68;00:05:33,472;00:05:36,574;Is that a precious
68;00:05:33,472;00:05:36,574;thing to you?
69;00:06:17,539;00:06:20,340;It's a birthday message
69;00:06:17,539;00:06:20,340;to his grand-niece Walda.
70;00:06:20,375;00:06:22,476;Or so Walder Frey
70;00:06:20,375;00:06:22,476;would have you think.
71;00:06:22,510;00:06:24,811;Keep shooting them down.
71;00:06:22,510;00:06:24,811;We can't risk Lord Walder
72;00:06:24,845;00:06:27,446;sending word of your movements
72;00:06:24,845;00:06:27,446;to the Lannisters.
73;00:06:27,481;00:06:30,482;He's grandfather's bannerman.
73;00:06:27,481;00:06:30,482;We can't expect his support?
74;00:06:30,517;00:06:34,451;Expect nothing of Walder Frey
74;00:06:30,517;00:06:34,451;and you'll never be surprised.
75;00:06:34,486;00:06:36,587;Look.
76;00:06:37,755;00:06:39,656;Father rots
76;00:06:37,755;00:06:39,656;in a dungeon.
77;00:06:39,690;00:06:41,724;How long before
77;00:06:39,690;00:06:41,724;they take his head?
78;00:06:41,758;00:06:45,060;We need to cross the Trident
78;00:06:41,758;00:06:45,060;and we need to do it now.
79;00:06:45,094;00:06:47,495;Just march up to his gates
79;00:06:45,094;00:06:47,495;and tell him you're crossing.
80;00:06:47,530;00:06:50,498;We've got five times his numbers.
80;00:06:47,530;00:06:50,498;You can take the Twins if you have to.
81;00:06:50,532;00:06:53,901;Not in time. Tywin Lannister
81;00:06:50,532;00:06:53,901;marches north as we speak.
82;00:06:53,935;00:06:56,669;The Freys have held
82;00:06:53,935;00:06:56,669;the crossing for 600 years,
83;00:06:56,703;00:07:00,105;and for 600 years they have never
83;00:06:56,703;00:07:00,105;failed to exact their toll.
84;00:07:00,139;00:07:01,973;Have my horse
84;00:07:00,139;00:07:01,973;saddled and ready.
85;00:07:02,007;00:07:05,710;Enter the Twins alone
85;00:07:02,007;00:07:05,710;and he'll sell you to the Lannis.
86;00:07:05,744;00:07:08,578;Or throw you in a dungeon.
86;00:07:05,744;00:07:08,578;Or slit your throat.
87;00:07:11,048;00:07:14,017;My father would do whatever
87;00:07:11,048;00:07:14,017;it took to secure our crossing.
88;00:07:14,052;00:07:16,253;Whatever it took.
89;00:07:16,287;00:07:18,188;If I'm going
89;00:07:16,287;00:07:18,188;to lead this army,
90;00:07:18,223;00:07:20,725;I can't have other men
90;00:07:18,223;00:07:20,725;doing my bargaining for me.
91;00:07:20,759;00:07:23,295;I agree.
92;00:07:24,330;00:07:25,864;I'll go.
92;00:07:24,330;00:07:25,864;Theon: You can't!
93;00:07:25,898;00:07:28,499;I have known Lord Walder
93;00:07:25,898;00:07:28,499;since I was a girl.
94;00:07:28,533;00:07:30,167;He would never
94;00:07:28,533;00:07:30,167;harm me.
95;00:07:30,202;00:07:32,836;Unless there was
95;00:07:30,202;00:07:32,836;a profit in it.
96;00:07:38,442;00:07:40,342;What do you want?
97;00:07:40,377;00:07:44,044;It is a great pleasure to see you
97;00:07:40,377;00:07:44,044;again after so many years, My Lord.
98;00:07:44,079;00:07:45,879;Oh spare me.
99;00:07:45,913;00:07:48,882;Your boy's too proud
99;00:07:45,913;00:07:48,882;to come before me himself.
100;00:07:48,916;00:07:52,184;What am I supposed
100;00:07:48,916;00:07:52,184;to do with you?
101;00:07:52,219;00:07:55,554;Father, you forget yourself.
101;00:07:52,219;00:07:55,554;Lady Stark is here--
102;00:07:55,588;00:07:59,023;Who asked you?
102;00:07:55,588;00:07:59,023;You're not Lord Frey yet,
103;00:07:59,058;00:08:01,525;not until I die.
103;00:07:59,058;00:08:01,525;Do I look dead to you?
104;00:08:01,550;00:08:02,470;Father, please--
105;00:08:02,495;00:08:05,108;I need lessons in courtesy
105;00:08:02,495;00:08:05,108;from you, bastard?
106;00:08:05,463;00:08:07,997;Your mother would still
106;00:08:05,463;00:08:07,997;be a milkmaid
107;00:08:08,032;00:08:10,933;if I hadn't squirted you
107;00:08:08,032;00:08:10,933;into her belly.
108;00:08:14,504;00:08:17,672;All right,
108;00:08:14,504;00:08:17,672;you come forward.
109;00:08:29,150;00:08:31,517;There. Now that I've observed
109;00:08:29,150;00:08:31,517;the courtesies,
110;00:08:31,551;00:08:35,220;perhaps my sons will do me the honor
110;00:08:31,551;00:08:35,220;of shutting their mouths.
111;00:08:40,526;00:08:42,526;Is there somewhere
111;00:08:40,526;00:08:42,526;we can talk?
112;00:08:42,560;00:08:45,462;We're talking
112;00:08:42,560;00:08:45,462;right now.
113;00:08:48,732;00:08:50,266;Fine.
114;00:08:50,300;00:08:52,934;Out! All of you!
115;00:09:02,912;00:09:04,779;You too.
116;00:09:11,987;00:09:14,154;You see that?
117;00:09:14,189;00:09:15,789;15 she is.
118;00:09:15,824;00:09:18,258;A little flower.
119;00:09:19,894;00:09:22,795;And her honey's all mine.
120;00:09:24,831;00:09:27,333;I'm sure she will
120;00:09:24,831;00:09:27,333;give you many sons.
121;00:09:27,367;00:09:31,103;Huh. Your father didn't
121;00:09:27,367;00:09:31,103;come to the wedding.
122;00:09:31,137;00:09:33,472;He is quite ill, My Lord.
123;00:09:33,506;00:09:36,408;Didn't come to
123;00:09:33,506;00:09:36,408;the last one either.
124;00:09:36,443;00:09:38,911;Or the one before that.
125;00:09:40,447;00:09:42,514;Your family has always
125;00:09:40,447;00:09:42,514;pissed on me.
126;00:09:42,548;00:09:45,349;My Lord, I--
126;00:09:42,548;00:09:45,349;Don't deny it. You know it's true.
127;00:09:45,384;00:09:47,752;The fine Lord Tully
128;00:09:47,786;00:09:50,053;would never marry any
128;00:09:47,786;00:09:50,053;of his children to mine.
129;00:09:50,087;00:09:52,021;I'm sure there
129;00:09:50,087;00:09:52,021;were reasons why--
130;00:09:52,055;00:09:54,690;I didn't need reasons.
130;00:09:52,055;00:09:54,690;I needed to get rid
131;00:09:54,724;00:09:58,260;of sons and daughters.
131;00:09:54,724;00:09:58,260;You see how they pile up?
132;00:10:01,697;00:10:04,431;Why are you here?
133;00:10:04,466;00:10:07,099;To ask you
134;00:10:07,134;00:10:09,434;to open your gates,
134;00:10:07,134;00:10:09,434;My Lord,
135;00:10:09,469;00:10:13,949;so my son and his bannermen may cross
135;00:10:09,469;00:10:13,949;the Trident and be on their way.
136;00:10:13,950;00:10:15,183;Why should I let him?
137;00:10:15,208;00:10:17,157;If you could climb
137;00:10:15,208;00:10:17,157;your own battlements,
138;00:10:17,509;00:10:21,011;you would see that he has
138;00:10:17,509;00:10:21,011;20,000 men outside your walls.
139;00:10:21,045;00:10:24,447;They'll be 20,000 corpses
139;00:10:21,045;00:10:24,447;when Tywin Lannister gets here.
140;00:10:24,482;00:10:26,949;Don't try and frighten me,
140;00:10:24,482;00:10:26,949;Lady Stark.
141;00:10:26,984;00:10:29,518;Your husband's in a cell
141;00:10:26,984;00:10:29,518;beneath the Red Keep
142;00:10:29,553;00:10:32,454;and your son's got no fur
142;00:10:29,553;00:10:32,454;to keep his balls warm.
143;00:10:32,488;00:10:34,923;You swore an oath
143;00:10:32,488;00:10:34,923;to my father.
144;00:10:34,957;00:10:37,225;Oh yes, I said some words...
145;00:10:37,259;00:10:41,094;And I swore oaths to the crown too,
145;00:10:37,259;00:10:41,094;if I remember right.
146;00:10:41,129;00:10:44,930;Joffrey's King now,
146;00:10:41,129;00:10:44,930;which makes your boy
147;00:10:44,965;00:10:48,500;and his corpses-to-be nothing
147;00:10:44,965;00:10:48,500;but rebels, it seems to me.
148;00:10:50,002;00:10:52,369;If I had the sense
148;00:10:50,002;00:10:52,369;the Gods gave a fish,
149;00:10:52,403;00:10:54,438;I'd hand you both
149;00:10:52,403;00:10:54,438;over to the Lannisters.
150;00:10:54,472;00:10:57,007;Why don't you?
150;00:10:54,472;00:10:57,007;Stark, Tully,
151;00:10:57,041;00:10:59,309;Lannister, Baratheon,
152;00:10:59,377;00:11:02,011;give me one good reason
153;00:11:02,046;00:11:05,481;why I should waste
153;00:11:02,046;00:11:05,481;a single thought on any of you?
154;00:11:05,515;00:11:08,851;And... engage.
155;00:11:10,051;00:11:12,384;When does Aemon think you'll
155;00:11:10,051;00:11:12,384;be able to use that hand?
156;00:11:12,656;00:11:15,490;Soon, he says.
156;00:11:12,656;00:11:15,490;Good.
157;00:11:15,525;00:11:19,494;You'll be ready
157;00:11:15,525;00:11:19,494;for this then.
158;00:11:19,529;00:11:22,764;I thought a wolf was
158;00:11:19,529;00:11:22,764;more appropriate for you
159;00:11:22,798;00:11:24,866;than a bear...
160;00:11:24,901;00:11:28,870;So I had a new pommel made.
160;00:11:24,901;00:11:28,870;It's called Longclaw.
161;00:11:28,904;00:11:32,739;Works as well for a wolf
161;00:11:28,904;00:11:32,739;as a bear, I think.
162;00:11:43,515;00:11:46,250;This is Valyrian steel.
163;00:11:46,284;00:11:49,052;It was my father's sword,
164;00:11:49,086;00:11:50,954;his father before him.
165;00:11:50,988;00:11:54,590;The Mormonts have carried it
165;00:11:50,988;00:11:54,590;for five centuries.
166;00:11:54,624;00:11:56,692;It was meant
166;00:11:54,624;00:11:56,692;for my son Jorah.
167;00:11:56,726;00:11:59,461;He brought dishonor
167;00:11:56,726;00:11:59,461;to our House,
168;00:11:59,495;00:12:01,997;but he had the grace
168;00:11:59,495;00:12:01,997;to leave the sword
169;00:12:02,031;00:12:04,800;before he fled
169;00:12:02,031;00:12:04,800;from Westeros.
170;00:12:04,834;00:12:07,169;My Lord, you honor me,
170;00:12:04,834;00:12:07,169;but I can't--
171;00:12:07,203;00:12:09,770;Oh, you can
171;00:12:07,203;00:12:09,770;and you will.
172;00:12:09,805;00:12:14,140;I wouldn't be standing here if it
172;00:12:09,805;00:12:14,140;wasn't for you and your beast.
173;00:12:15,676;00:12:18,444;A bloody dead man
173;00:12:15,676;00:12:18,444;tried to kill me...
174;00:12:20,079;00:12:23,281;So you'll take it.
174;00:12:20,079;00:12:23,281;I'll hear no more about it.
175;00:12:23,316;00:12:26,050;Is that understood?
175;00:12:23,316;00:12:26,050;Yes, My Lord.
176;00:12:26,084;00:12:29,152;Right.
176;00:12:26,084;00:12:29,152;Now don't think this means
177;00:12:29,187;00:12:31,488;I approve
177;00:12:29,187;00:12:31,488;of this nonsense
178;00:12:31,523;00:12:33,590;with you
178;00:12:31,523;00:12:33,590;and Alliser Thorne.
179;00:12:33,624;00:12:36,158;That's a man's sword,
180;00:12:36,193;00:12:38,861;it'll take
180;00:12:36,193;00:12:38,861;a man to wield it.
181;00:12:38,895;00:12:40,897;I'll apologize
181;00:12:38,895;00:12:40,897;to Ser Alliser tonight.
182;00:12:40,932;00:12:42,365;No you won't!
183;00:12:42,400;00:12:44,467;I sent him to King's Landing
183;00:12:42,400;00:12:44,467;yesterday.
184;00:12:44,501;00:12:46,703;The hand that your wolf
185;00:12:46,737;00:12:48,304;tore off
185;00:12:46,737;00:12:48,304;that thing's wrist--
186;00:12:48,339;00:12:52,041;I've ordered Thorne to lay it
186;00:12:48,339;00:12:52,041;at the feet of this...
187;00:12:52,075;00:12:53,909;Boy King.
188;00:12:53,943;00:12:56,778;That should get young
188;00:12:53,943;00:12:56,778;Joffrey's attention.
189;00:12:56,812;00:13:00,313;And it puts
189;00:12:56,812;00:13:00,313;a thousand leagues
190;00:13:00,347;00:13:03,115;between you and Thorne.
191;00:13:03,149;00:13:05,651;Now go and put your sword
191;00:13:03,149;00:13:05,651;somewhere safe
192;00:13:05,685;00:13:08,286;and bring me
192;00:13:05,685;00:13:08,286;my supper.
193;00:13:08,320;00:13:10,787;Yes, My Lord.
194;00:13:21,332;00:13:23,899;Well done.
194;00:13:21,332;00:13:23,899;Well done.
195;00:13:25,702;00:13:27,670;You earned that, Snow.
196;00:13:31,540;00:13:33,673;Well done.
197;00:13:38,076;00:13:39,409;Go on,
197;00:13:38,076;00:13:39,409;let's have a look.
198;00:13:39,443;00:13:41,845;At what?
198;00:13:39,443;00:13:41,845;Grenn: The sword! Show us the sword.
199;00:13:41,879;00:13:45,082;Sword! Sword!
199;00:13:41,879;00:13:45,082;Sword! Sword!
200;00:13:53,525;00:13:55,159;Let's have a look.
200;00:13:53,525;00:13:55,159;Piss off.
201;00:13:55,194;00:13:58,195;Get off of it.
201;00:13:55,194;00:13:58,195;Piss off.
202;00:13:58,230;00:14:00,664;Come on, I want to have
202;00:13:58,230;00:14:00,664;a look at it in the light.
203;00:14:04,169;00:14:06,237;Give it here!
204;00:14:06,271;00:14:08,139;What is it?
205;00:14:08,173;00:14:10,241;I--
205;00:14:08,173;00:14:10,241;Look at its eyes.
206;00:14:10,275;00:14:11,809;Give it.
206;00:14:10,275;00:14:11,809;I can't.
207;00:14:11,844;00:14:14,612;You can't what?
208;00:14:14,646;00:14:19,182;I-- I'm really not
208;00:14:14,646;00:14:19,182;supposed to say.
209;00:14:19,217;00:14:22,685;And yet you really
209;00:14:19,217;00:14:22,685;want to say.
210;00:14:22,719;00:14:25,454;You want to say
210;00:14:22,719;00:14:25,454;that...?
211;00:14:28,124;00:14:30,726;There was a raven.
212;00:14:30,760;00:14:33,128;I read the message
212;00:14:30,760;00:14:33,128;to Maester Aemon.
213;00:14:34,730;00:14:36,931;It's your brother Robb.
214;00:14:36,965;00:14:39,099;What?
215;00:14:39,134;00:14:40,934;What about him?
216;00:14:42,269;00:14:43,903;He's heading south.
217;00:14:43,938;00:14:45,805;To war.
218;00:14:47,708;00:14:51,143;All his bannermen have rallied
218;00:14:47,708;00:14:51,143;to his side. They'll keep him safe.
219;00:14:52,946;00:14:55,313;I should be there.
220;00:14:57,115;00:14:59,650;I should be with him.
221;00:15:13,496;00:15:15,996;...If we do that, they'll never
221;00:15:13,496;00:15:15,996;get back across.
222;00:15:17,699;00:15:19,566;Well?
223;00:15:19,600;00:15:22,101;What did he say?
224;00:15:22,135;00:15:25,003;Lord Walder has granted
224;00:15:22,135;00:15:25,003;your crossing.
225;00:15:26,739;00:15:29,974;His men are yours as well--
225;00:15:26,739;00:15:29,974;Greatjon: Huh.
226;00:15:30,008;00:15:32,209;--Less the 400 he will keep here
226;00:15:30,008;00:15:32,209;to hold the crossing
227;00:15:32,244;00:15:33,945;against any who would
227;00:15:32,244;00:15:33,945;pursue you.
228;00:15:33,979;00:15:35,380;And what does
228;00:15:33,979;00:15:35,380;he want in return?
229;00:15:35,414;00:15:39,016;You will be taking on his son
229;00:15:35,414;00:15:39,016;Olyvar as your personal squire.
230;00:15:39,050;00:15:42,753;He expects a knighthood in good time.
230;00:15:39,050;00:15:42,753;Fine fine.
231;00:15:44,723;00:15:46,189;And?
232;00:15:46,224;00:15:49,225;And Arya
233;00:15:49,260;00:15:51,427;will marry his son Waldron
234;00:15:51,461;00:15:54,530;when they both come of age.
234;00:15:51,461;00:15:54,530;She won't be happy about that.
235;00:15:54,564;00:15:56,298;Hmmm.
236;00:15:59,102;00:16:00,669;And?
237;00:16:02,338;00:16:04,406;And
238;00:16:04,441;00:16:07,476;when the fighting
238;00:16:04,441;00:16:07,476;is done...
239;00:16:09,179;00:16:11,380;You will marry
239;00:16:09,179;00:16:11,380;one of his daughters.
240;00:16:12,316;00:16:14,350;Whichever you prefer.
241;00:16:14,384;00:16:17,887;He has a number he thinks
241;00:16:14,384;00:16:17,887;will be... suitable.
242;00:16:17,921;00:16:19,989;I see.
243;00:16:21,524;00:16:24,126;Did you get a look at his daughters?
244;00:16:24,160;00:16:25,927;I did.
245;00:16:25,961;00:16:28,195;And?
246;00:16:29,264;00:16:31,398;One was...
247;00:16:36,971;00:16:38,671;Do you consent?
248;00:16:38,706;00:16:40,640;Can I refuse?
249;00:16:40,674;00:16:42,841;Not if you want to cross.
250;00:16:46,278;00:16:48,313;Then I consent.
251;00:17:33,153;00:17:35,454;Sam said you wanted
251;00:17:33,153;00:17:35,454;to see me?
252;00:17:35,488;00:17:37,356;I did indeed.
253;00:17:37,390;00:17:41,055;Perhaps you would be
253;00:17:37,390;00:17:41,055;kind enough to assist me.
254;00:17:44,358;00:17:46,793;Tell me,
254;00:17:44,358;00:17:46,793;did you ever wonder
255;00:17:46,827;00:17:49,695;why the men
255;00:17:46,827;00:17:49,695;of The Night's Watch
256;00:17:49,729;00:17:52,597;take no wives
256;00:17:49,729;00:17:52,597;and father no children?
257;00:17:52,632;00:17:54,732;No.
258;00:17:54,767;00:17:57,201;So they will not love.
259;00:17:57,235;00:18:00,770;Love is the death
259;00:17:57,235;00:18:00,770;of duty.
260;00:18:00,805;00:18:04,774;If the day should ever come when
260;00:18:00,805;00:18:04,774;your lord father was forced to choose
261;00:18:04,808;00:18:07,409;between honor
261;00:18:04,808;00:18:07,409;on the one hand
262;00:18:07,444;00:18:10,078;and those he loves
262;00:18:07,444;00:18:10,078;on the other,
263;00:18:10,113;00:18:12,147;what would he do?
264;00:18:12,181;00:18:16,550;He would do whatever was right.
264;00:18:12,181;00:18:16,550;No matter what.
265;00:18:16,585;00:18:21,355;Then Lord Stark
265;00:18:16,585;00:18:21,355;is one man in 10,000.
266;00:18:21,389;00:18:24,524;Most of us are not
266;00:18:21,389;00:18:24,524;so strong.
267;00:18:24,558;00:18:26,392;What is honor
268;00:18:26,426;00:18:29,028;compared
268;00:18:26,426;00:18:29,028;to a woman's love?
269;00:18:29,062;00:18:31,630;And what is duty
270;00:18:31,664;00:18:35,200;against the feel of a newborn son
270;00:18:31,664;00:18:35,200;in your arms?
271;00:18:35,234;00:18:38,903;Or a brother's smile?
272;00:18:41,940;00:18:43,640;Sam told you.
273;00:18:43,675;00:18:45,575;We're all human.
274;00:18:45,609;00:18:49,177;Oh, we all do our duty when
274;00:18:45,609;00:18:49,177;there's no cost to it.
275;00:18:49,212;00:18:52,013;Honor comes easy then.
276;00:18:52,047;00:18:54,983;Yet sooner or later
277;00:18:55,017;00:18:57,885;in every man's life
278;00:18:57,920;00:19:00,788;there comes a day
278;00:18:57,920;00:19:00,788;when it is not easy,
279;00:19:00,822;00:19:04,090;a day when
279;00:19:00,822;00:19:04,090;he must choose.
280;00:19:05,926;00:19:07,893;And this is my day?
281;00:19:07,927;00:19:10,028;Is that what
281;00:19:07,927;00:19:10,028;you're saying?
282;00:19:10,063;00:19:13,198;Oh, it hurts, boy.
282;00:19:10,063;00:19:13,198;Oh yes.
283;00:19:13,232;00:19:16,300;I know.
283;00:19:13,232;00:19:16,300;You do not know!
284;00:19:17,936;00:19:20,104;No one knows.
285;00:19:22,040;00:19:24,007;I may be a bastard,
286;00:19:24,042;00:19:26,510;but he is my father
286;00:19:24,042;00:19:26,510;and Robb is my brother.
287;00:19:30,816;00:19:34,652;The Gods were cruel when they
287;00:19:30,816;00:19:34,652;saw fit to test my vows.
288;00:19:34,687;00:19:37,156;They waited till I was old.
289;00:19:38,859;00:19:42,295;What could I do when the ravens
289;00:19:38,859;00:19:42,295;brought the news from the South--
290;00:19:42,329;00:19:45,230;the ruin of my House,
290;00:19:42,329;00:19:45,230;the death of my family?
291;00:19:45,265;00:19:47,899;I was helpless,
292;00:19:47,933;00:19:50,734;blind, frail.
293;00:19:52,336;00:19:55,438;But when I heard
294;00:19:55,472;00:19:58,073;they had killed
294;00:19:55,472;00:19:58,073;my brother's son,
295;00:19:58,107;00:20:00,175;and his poor son...
296;00:20:00,209;00:20:01,642;And the children!
297;00:20:01,677;00:20:04,879;Even the little children.
298;00:20:05,814;00:20:07,981;Who are you?
299;00:20:10,051;00:20:13,853;My father was Maekar,
300;00:20:13,887;00:20:16,221;the first of his name.
301;00:20:16,255;00:20:20,458;My brother Aegon
301;00:20:16,255;00:20:20,458;reigned after him
302;00:20:20,492;00:20:23,460;when I had refused
302;00:20:20,492;00:20:23,460;the Throne.
303;00:20:23,495;00:20:27,064;And he was followed
303;00:20:23,495;00:20:27,064;by his son Aerys,
304;00:20:27,098;00:20:29,766;whom they called
304;00:20:27,098;00:20:29,766;the Mad King.
305;00:20:29,800;00:20:33,102;You're Aemon Targaryen.
306;00:20:33,136;00:20:36,071;I'm a Maester
306;00:20:33,136;00:20:36,071;of the Citadel,
307;00:20:36,106;00:20:41,643;bound in service to Castle Black
307;00:20:36,106;00:20:41,643;and The Night's Watch.
308;00:20:43,679;00:20:47,915;I will not tell you
308;00:20:43,679;00:20:47,915;to stay or go.
309;00:20:47,949;00:20:51,418;You must make
309;00:20:47,949;00:20:51,418;that choice yourself,
310;00:20:51,452;00:20:55,454;and live with it
310;00:20:51,452;00:20:55,454;for the rest of your days.
311;00:20:57,857;00:20:59,891;As I have.
312;00:21:25,613;00:21:27,513;Drogo.
313;00:21:36,053;00:21:38,790;Sajo anni.
314;00:22:32,608;00:22:34,309;Hyah hyah.
315;00:22:54,060;00:22:55,727;Our scouts tell us
316;00:22:55,762;00:22:58,430;the Stark host has moved
316;00:22:55,762;00:22:58,430;south from the Twins
317;00:22:58,464;00:23:01,165;with Lord Frey's levies
317;00:22:58,464;00:23:01,165;in tow.
318;00:23:01,199;00:23:03,300;They're a day's
318;00:23:01,199;00:23:03,300;march north.
319;00:23:03,334;00:23:06,003;The boy may lack
319;00:23:03,334;00:23:06,003;experience and sense,
320;00:23:06,037;00:23:09,106;but he does have
320;00:23:06,037;00:23:09,106;a certain mindless
321;00:23:09,140;00:23:12,442;provincial courage.
321;00:23:09,140;00:23:12,442;Ah.
322;00:23:15,912;00:23:18,179;Oh, do continue.
322;00:23:15,912;00:23:18,179;Didn't mean to interrupt.
323;00:23:18,214;00:23:20,715;I do hope your savages
323;00:23:18,214;00:23:20,715;are going to be of some use,
324;00:23:20,749;00:23:22,717;otherwise we've wasted
324;00:23:20,749;00:23:22,717;good steel on them.
325;00:23:22,751;00:23:26,153;The great hairy one insisted he
325;00:23:22,751;00:23:26,153;must have two battle axes--
326;00:23:26,187;00:23:28,722;heavy black steel,
326;00:23:26,187;00:23:28,722;double-sided.
327;00:23:28,756;00:23:30,690;Shagga likes axes.
328;00:23:30,724;00:23:33,325;When the battle commences,
328;00:23:30,724;00:23:33,325;you and your wildlings
329;00:23:33,360;00:23:35,560;will be in the vanguard.
330;00:23:35,594;00:23:37,028;The vanguard?
330;00:23:35,594;00:23:37,028;Mm-hmm.
331;00:23:37,062;00:23:38,929;Me and the tribesmen
331;00:23:37,062;00:23:38,929;on the front lines?
332;00:23:38,964;00:23:42,467;They do seem
332;00:23:38,964;00:23:42,467;rather ferocious.
333;00:23:44,637;00:23:47,840;Ferocious?
333;00:23:44,637;00:23:47,840;Last night
334;00:23:47,874;00:23:51,510;a Moon brother stabbed
334;00:23:47,874;00:23:51,510;a Stone Crow over a sausage.
335;00:23:51,545;00:23:55,415;Three Stone Crows seized the Moon
335;00:23:51,545;00:23:55,415;brother and opened his throat.
336;00:23:55,450;00:23:58,418;Bronn managed to keep Shagga from
336;00:23:55,450;00:23:58,418;chopping off the dead man's cock,
337;00:23:58,453;00:24:00,654;which was fortunate,
337;00:23:58,453;00:24:00,654;but even still
338;00:24:00,688;00:24:02,489;Ulf is demanding
338;00:24:00,688;00:24:02,489;blood money,
339;00:24:02,523;00:24:05,125;which Shagga and Gunthor
339;00:24:02,523;00:24:05,125;refuse to pay.
340;00:24:05,159;00:24:08,261;When soldiers lack discipline,
340;00:24:05,159;00:24:08,261;the fault lies with their commander.
341;00:24:08,296;00:24:09,829;Surely there are ways
341;00:24:08,296;00:24:09,829;to have me killed
342;00:24:09,864;00:24:11,899;that would be less detrimental
342;00:24:09,864;00:24:11,899;to the war effort.
343;00:24:11,933;00:24:14,635;There'll be no more
343;00:24:11,933;00:24:14,635;discussion on the matter.
344;00:24:18,873;00:24:22,075;It appears I'm not
344;00:24:18,873;00:24:22,075;hungry after all.
345;00:24:22,109;00:24:23,977;Excuse me, My Lords.
346;00:24:36,622;00:24:39,657;Where did you find one
346;00:24:36,622;00:24:39,657;so pretty at this hour?
347;00:24:39,691;00:24:42,426;I took her.
347;00:24:39,691;00:24:42,426;Took her?
348;00:24:42,460;00:24:45,495;From whom?
348;00:24:42,460;00:24:45,495;From, uh...
349;00:24:45,529;00:24:47,396;Ser-- what's his name?
350;00:24:47,431;00:24:50,132;I don't know.
350;00:24:47,431;00:24:50,132;Ginger cunt three tents down.
351;00:24:50,166;00:24:53,369;And he didn't have anything
351;00:24:50,166;00:24:53,369;to say about it?
352;00:24:53,403;00:24:56,905;He said something.
353;00:24:59,008;00:25:01,975;Well, the odds of me
353;00:24:59,008;00:25:01,975;living long enough
354;00:25:02,010;00:25:04,611;for him to retaliate
354;00:25:02,010;00:25:04,611;just dropped drastically.
355;00:25:04,645;00:25:07,046;We'll be at
355;00:25:04,645;00:25:07,046;the vanguard tomorrow.
356;00:25:09,716;00:25:11,916;Oh well.
357;00:25:13,185;00:25:17,221;I... think I'll go
357;00:25:13,185;00:25:17,221;and find myself one.
358;00:25:20,759;00:25:22,191;Who are you?
359;00:25:22,225;00:25:24,526;Who would you like me to be?
360;00:25:24,527;00:25:26,962;What did your mother
360;00:25:24,527;00:25:26,962;call you?
361;00:25:26,996;00:25:28,748;Shae.
362;00:25:28,773;00:25:30,509;What did your
362;00:25:28,773;00:25:30,509;mother call you?
363;00:25:30,700;00:25:33,102;My mother died
363;00:25:30,700;00:25:33,102;giving birth to me.
364;00:25:33,136;00:25:36,672;Is that why I'm here?
364;00:25:33,136;00:25:36,672;So we can talk about our mothers?
365;00:25:36,707;00:25:40,208;What sort of accent is that?
365;00:25:36,707;00:25:40,208;Foreign.
366;00:25:40,276;00:25:42,076;For--
367;00:25:43,478;00:25:45,212;What do you want
367;00:25:43,478;00:25:45,212;from me?
368;00:25:45,247;00:25:47,981;What do I want from you?
369;00:25:48,015;00:25:51,351;I want you to share my tent.
370;00:25:51,385;00:25:54,420;I want you to pour my wine,
370;00:25:51,385;00:25:54,420;laugh at my jokes,
371;00:25:54,454;00:25:57,257;rub my legs when they're
371;00:25:54,454;00:25:57,257;sore after a day's ride.
372;00:25:57,291;00:25:59,559;I want you to take
372;00:25:57,291;00:25:59,559;no other man to bed
373;00:25:59,593;00:26:01,560;for as long
373;00:25:59,593;00:26:01,560;as we're together.
374;00:26:01,595;00:26:05,764;And I want you to fuck me
374;00:26:01,595;00:26:05,764;like it's my last night in this world--
375;00:26:05,798;00:26:08,067;which it may well be.
376;00:26:08,101;00:26:09,703;And what do I get?
377;00:26:09,737;00:26:12,973;Safety.
378;00:26:13,007;00:26:15,743;No one will hurt you
378;00:26:13,007;00:26:15,743;for as long as you're mine.
379;00:26:16,812;00:26:19,145;The pleasure
379;00:26:16,812;00:26:19,145;of my company,
380;00:26:19,180;00:26:22,147;which I have heard
380;00:26:19,180;00:26:22,147;is spectacular.
381;00:26:22,182;00:26:24,516;Who told you this?
381;00:26:22,182;00:26:24,516;Women you paid?
382;00:26:24,550;00:26:27,652;And three: More gold
383;00:26:27,686;00:26:31,154;than you can spend if you
383;00:26:27,686;00:26:31,154;lived a thousand years.
384;00:26:31,188;00:26:34,290;Do you accept my proposal?
385;00:26:52,538;00:26:55,840;Let's start with your last night
385;00:26:52,538;00:26:55,840;in this world.
386;00:27:15,560;00:27:17,560;Doth-- Dothrae...
387;00:27:17,594;00:27:21,026;Ki ha-- hammi...
388;00:27:21,061;00:27:24,762;Ish nokitta...
389;00:27:24,797;00:27:26,764;Qana'th...
390;00:27:28,733;00:27:30,134;Khaleesi.
391;00:27:30,168;00:27:31,568;Come.
392;00:27:33,938;00:27:35,972;He's very strong.
393;00:27:36,006;00:27:39,141;No one understands
393;00:27:36,006;00:27:39,141;how strong he is.
394;00:27:57,424;00:28:01,026;He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
394;00:27:57,424;00:28:01,026;He can't.
395;00:28:01,060;00:28:03,762;He can't.
395;00:28:01,060;00:28:03,762;I won't let him.
396;00:28:03,796;00:28:07,031;Even a Queen doesn't
396;00:28:03,796;00:28:07,031;have that power.
397;00:28:09,701;00:28:12,936;We must go quickly. I've heard
397;00:28:09,701;00:28:12,936;there's a good port in Asshai--
398;00:28:12,970;00:28:17,173;I won't leave him.
398;00:28:12,970;00:28:17,173;He's already gone, Khaleesi.
399;00:28:17,207;00:28:19,241;Doth--
400;00:28:19,276;00:28:21,176;Even if--
401;00:28:21,211;00:28:24,279;--Even if he dies,
402;00:28:24,314;00:28:27,116;why would I run?
403;00:28:27,150;00:28:29,351;I am Khaleesi
404;00:28:29,385;00:28:32,988;and my-- my son will be
404;00:28:29,385;00:28:32,988;Khal after Drogo.
405;00:28:33,022;00:28:36,091;This isn't Westeros
405;00:28:33,022;00:28:36,091;where men honor blood.
406;00:28:36,125;00:28:39,127;Here they only honor strength.
406;00:28:36,125;00:28:39,127;There will be fighting
407;00:28:39,161;00:28:40,962;after Drogo dies.
408;00:28:40,996;00:28:43,632;Whoever wins that fight
408;00:28:40,996;00:28:43,632;will be the new Khal.
409;00:28:43,666;00:28:45,867;He won't want any rivals.
410;00:28:45,902;00:28:48,503;Your boy will be plucked
410;00:28:45,902;00:28:48,503;from your breast
411;00:28:48,537;00:28:50,705;and given to the dogs.
412;00:28:50,740;00:28:54,442;I won't leave him.
413;00:29:03,953;00:29:06,921;The wound
413;00:29:03,953;00:29:06,921;has festered.
414;00:30:06,944;00:30:09,812;I think you should wear
414;00:30:06,944;00:30:09,812;your armor tonight, Ser.
415;00:30:09,846;00:30:12,447;I think you're right.
416;00:30:16,985;00:30:18,653;You've saved me
416;00:30:16,985;00:30:18,653;once more.
417;00:30:18,687;00:30:21,322;And now you must
417;00:30:18,687;00:30:21,322;save him.
418;00:30:21,357;00:30:23,725;He's beyond
418;00:30:21,357;00:30:23,725;the healer's skills.
419;00:30:23,759;00:30:26,460;All I can do is
419;00:30:23,759;00:30:26,460;ease his path.
420;00:30:26,494;00:30:28,628;Save him and I will free you.
420;00:30:26,494;00:30:28,628;I swear it.
421;00:30:29,865;00:30:31,932;You must know a way...
422;00:30:31,966;00:30:33,800;Some...
423;00:30:33,834;00:30:35,701;Some magic.
424;00:30:38,305;00:30:40,205;There is a spell.
425;00:30:40,239;00:30:42,473;Some would say death
425;00:30:40,239;00:30:42,473;is cleaner.
426;00:30:53,285;00:30:55,019;Do it.
427;00:30:55,053;00:30:57,120;Save him.
428;00:30:57,155;00:30:58,954;There is a price.
429;00:30:58,979;00:31:00,493;You'll have gold--
429;00:30:58,979;00:31:00,493;whatever you want.
430;00:31:00,557;00:31:02,991;It's not a matter of gold.
430;00:31:00,557;00:31:02,991;This is Bloodmagic.
431;00:31:03,026;00:31:05,293;Only death pays for life.
432;00:31:08,463;00:31:10,196;My death?
433;00:31:10,231;00:31:13,232;No.
433;00:31:10,231;00:31:13,232;Not your death, Khaleesi.
434;00:31:14,834;00:31:16,402;Bring me his horse.
435;00:31:39,828;00:31:41,462;Khaleesi,
435;00:31:39,828;00:31:41,462;do not do this thing.
436;00:31:41,496;00:31:45,265;Let me kill this witch.
436;00:31:41,496;00:31:45,265;Kill her and you kill your Khal.
437;00:31:45,299;00:31:48,101;This is Bloodmagic.
437;00:31:45,299;00:31:48,101;It is forbidden.
438;00:31:48,135;00:31:51,904;I am your Khaleesi.
438;00:31:48,135;00:31:51,904;I tell you what is forbidden.
439;00:32:02,182;00:32:03,616;Go now!
440;00:32:03,650;00:32:05,852;Take her and leave.
440;00:32:03,650;00:32:05,852;Huh-uh.
441;00:32:05,886;00:32:08,054;Take her!
442;00:32:10,357;00:32:11,491;Irriya?
443;00:32:12,759;00:32:14,327;You must go also, lady.
444;00:32:14,361;00:32:16,662;Once I begin to sing,
444;00:32:14,361;00:32:16,662;no one must enter the tent.
445;00:32:16,697;00:32:19,465;The dead will
445;00:32:16,697;00:32:19,465;dance here tonight.
446;00:32:32,045;00:32:34,547;No one will enter.
447;00:32:42,656;00:32:45,091;Bring him back to me.
448;00:33:01,575;00:33:03,476;What have you done?
449;00:33:03,510;00:33:05,811;I have to save him.
450;00:33:05,846;00:33:08,981;We could have been 10 miles away from
450;00:33:05,846;00:33:08,981;here by now on the way to Asshai.
451;00:33:09,016;00:33:11,217;You would have been safe.
452;00:33:17,357;00:33:19,625;Jíni'th vos eo.
453;00:33:23,864;00:33:25,431;Mra qothoon vosaan--
454;00:33:27,701;00:33:29,835;Khaleesi!
455;00:34:13,810;00:34:15,444;Are you hurt?
456;00:34:15,478;00:34:16,945;The baby...
456;00:34:15,478;00:34:16,945;Hmm?
457;00:34:16,980;00:34:18,614;...Is coming.
458;00:34:18,648;00:34:21,183;Fetch the midwives.
458;00:34:18,648;00:34:21,183;They will not come.
459;00:34:21,218;00:34:23,219;They say
459;00:34:21,218;00:34:23,219;she is cursed.
460;00:34:23,253;00:34:25,789;They'll come or I'll
460;00:34:23,253;00:34:25,789;have their heads.
461;00:34:27,058;00:34:29,559;The witch--
461;00:34:27,058;00:34:29,559;she can bring baby.
462;00:34:29,594;00:34:32,130;I hear her say so.
463;00:34:54,345;00:34:56,078;Are you in agony,
463;00:34:54,345;00:34:56,078;my lion?
464;00:34:56,112;00:34:58,680;No.
464;00:34:56,112;00:34:58,680;You look like you're in agony.
465;00:34:58,715;00:35:02,083;The fire is burning
465;00:34:58,715;00:35:02,083;your pretty soft skin.
466;00:35:05,286;00:35:07,354;Ahhh.
467;00:35:09,023;00:35:11,791;Damn you, woman.
467;00:35:09,023;00:35:11,791;Are you immune to pain?
468;00:35:11,825;00:35:14,026;Just used to it.
468;00:35:11,825;00:35:14,026;Drink.
469;00:35:16,062;00:35:18,797;Let's play a new game.
470;00:35:18,831;00:35:21,932;There's a Braavosi knife game
470;00:35:18,831;00:35:21,932;I could teach you--
471;00:35:21,967;00:35:24,768;Does it involve the potential
471;00:35:21,967;00:35:24,768;for losing fingers?
472;00:35:24,803;00:35:27,770;Not if you win.
472;00:35:24,803;00:35:27,770;No!
473;00:35:27,804;00:35:30,305;No more fire games,
473;00:35:27,804;00:35:30,305;no knife games.
474;00:35:30,339;00:35:33,241;Let's do something
474;00:35:30,339;00:35:33,241;I'm good at.
475;00:35:33,275;00:35:35,476;What are you good at?
476;00:35:35,510;00:35:37,477;I happen to be a great
476;00:35:35,510;00:35:37,477;judge of character.
477;00:35:37,512;00:35:39,912;This sounds like a boring game.
477;00:35:37,512;00:35:39,912;It's not.
478;00:35:39,946;00:35:42,715;Here's how it works:
478;00:35:39,946;00:35:42,715;I make a statement
479;00:35:42,749;00:35:45,184;about your past.
479;00:35:42,749;00:35:45,184;If I'm right,
480;00:35:45,218;00:35:47,452;you drink.
480;00:35:45,218;00:35:47,452;If I'm wrong, I drink.
481;00:35:47,487;00:35:50,187;And no lying.
481;00:35:47,487;00:35:50,187;I'll know if you're lying.
482;00:35:50,221;00:35:52,289;I don't want to play
482;00:35:50,221;00:35:52,289;this game.
483;00:35:52,323;00:35:54,524;Fine.
483;00:35:52,323;00:35:54,524;Bronn first.
484;00:35:58,429;00:36:00,863;Your father beat you.
485;00:36:06,001;00:36:08,468;But my mother
485;00:36:06,001;00:36:08,468;hit harder.
486;00:36:11,205;00:36:14,407;You killed your first man
486;00:36:11,205;00:36:14,407;before you were 12.
487;00:36:14,441;00:36:16,342;It was a woman.
488;00:36:18,812;00:36:20,979;She swung
488;00:36:18,812;00:36:20,979;an axe at me.
489;00:36:22,581;00:36:24,315;You've been
489;00:36:22,581;00:36:24,315;North of the Wall.
490;00:36:27,352;00:36:29,453;What brought you
490;00:36:27,352;00:36:29,453;up there?
491;00:36:30,622;00:36:31,756;Work.
492;00:36:31,824;00:36:33,825;And...
493;00:36:33,826;00:36:35,894;You once loved a woman
493;00:36:33,826;00:36:35,894;many years ago,
494;00:36:35,928;00:36:39,197;but it turned out badly so you've
494;00:36:35,928;00:36:39,197;never let yourself love again.
495;00:36:40,999;00:36:43,434;Oh wait, that's me.
496;00:36:46,638;00:36:49,506;Your turn, my mysterious
496;00:36:46,638;00:36:49,506;foreign beauty.
497;00:36:49,541;00:36:51,375;I don't want to play.
498;00:36:51,409;00:36:55,279;It's fun!
498;00:36:51,409;00:36:55,279;Look at the fun we're having.
499;00:36:58,416;00:36:59,950;Your mother
499;00:36:58,416;00:36:59,950;was a whore.
500;00:37:01,385;00:37:03,787;Drink.
501;00:37:09,327;00:37:11,227;All right.
502;00:37:11,262;00:37:13,997;Your father left the family when
502;00:37:11,262;00:37:13,997;you were very young,
503;00:37:14,031;00:37:16,032;never to return.
503;00:37:14,031;00:37:16,032;Drink.
504;00:37:17,240;00:37:18,991;And we've established
504;00:37:17,240;00:37:18,991;the rules about lying?
505;00:37:19,016;00:37:20,216;Drink!
506;00:37:23,574;00:37:26,142;Mmmm.
507;00:37:27,544;00:37:29,378;You wanted
507;00:37:27,544;00:37:29,378;a different life.
508;00:37:29,413;00:37:32,547;You came from somewhere
508;00:37:29,413;00:37:32,547;and you wanted to be elsewhere.
509;00:37:32,582;00:37:35,150;The whole shit-stained world
509;00:37:32,582;00:37:35,150;could drink off that one.
510;00:37:35,184;00:37:37,452;So specifics--
511;00:37:37,486;00:37:40,689;you wanted to be elsewhere,
511;00:37:37,486;00:37:40,689;but how would you get there?
512;00:37:40,723;00:37:44,393;I don't believe the life
512;00:37:40,723;00:37:44,393;of the silent sisters is for you.
513;00:37:44,427;00:37:48,697;So what's
513;00:37:44,427;00:37:48,697;a lowborn girl to do?
514;00:37:52,068;00:37:54,302;Drink.
515;00:37:56,038;00:37:59,007;Are you sure--
515;00:37:56,038;00:37:59,007;drink!
516;00:38:03,546;00:38:07,216;And don't talk about
516;00:38:03,546;00:38:07,216;my mother and father ever
517;00:38:07,251;00:38:10,688;or I will carve your eyes
517;00:38:07,251;00:38:10,688;from your head.
518;00:38:14,225;00:38:17,260;My dear lady, if I have
518;00:38:14,225;00:38:17,260;offended you, I apologize.
519;00:38:17,294;00:38:19,461;My turn.
520;00:38:19,496;00:38:21,897;Fine fine.
521;00:38:21,931;00:38:24,232;Ask away.
522;00:38:24,266;00:38:27,335;Try to penetrate
522;00:38:24,266;00:38:27,335;the enigma that is me.
523;00:38:27,369;00:38:30,137;Who were you in love with?
523;00:38:27,369;00:38:30,137;That's not how the game works.
524;00:38:30,171;00:38:32,505;I don't care the way
524;00:38:30,171;00:38:32,505;the game works.
525;00:38:32,540;00:38:34,641;Our Lord here
525;00:38:32,540;00:38:34,641;used to be married.
526;00:38:35,743;00:38:37,744;Married?
526;00:38:35,743;00:38:37,744;How did you hear that?
527;00:38:37,778;00:38:41,315;You hear lots of things playing
527;00:38:37,778;00:38:41,315;dice with Lannister soldiers.
528;00:38:43,752;00:38:45,053;Another night,
528;00:38:43,752;00:38:45,053;perhaps.
529;00:38:45,087;00:38:48,390;Not another night.
529;00:38:45,087;00:38:48,390;This night.
530;00:38:49,827;00:38:51,561;It's not
530;00:38:49,827;00:38:51,561;a pleasant story.
531;00:38:53,599;00:38:56,736;Or maybe I will cry.
531;00:38:53,599;00:38:56,736;I'm guessing the lady and I
532;00:38:56,770;00:38:59,506;can tell more unpleasant stories
532;00:38:56,770;00:38:59,506;than your Lordship.
533;00:39:01,906;00:39:04,173;So...
534;00:39:07,377;00:39:10,980;I was 16. My brother Jaime
534;00:39:07,377;00:39:10,980;and I were riding
535;00:39:11,014;00:39:14,716;when we heard a scream.
535;00:39:11,014;00:39:14,716;She ran out onto the road,
536;00:39:14,750;00:39:17,417;clothes half torn off
536;00:39:14,750;00:39:17,417;with two men on her heels.
537;00:39:17,452;00:39:21,987;Jaime scared away the men easily
537;00:39:17,452;00:39:21,987;enough, while I wrapped her in my cloak.
538;00:39:22,021;00:39:24,076;She was too scared to send off
538;00:39:22,021;00:39:24,076;on her own,
539;00:39:24,101;00:39:25,948;so while Jaime
539;00:39:24,101;00:39:25,948;hunted down the rapers
540;00:39:25,992;00:39:29,127;I took her to the nearest
540;00:39:25,992;00:39:29,127;inn and fed her.
541;00:39:29,161;00:39:31,929;Her name was Tysha.
542;00:39:31,963;00:39:34,198;She was
542;00:39:31,963;00:39:34,198;a wheelwright's orphan.
543;00:39:34,232;00:39:36,366;And she was hungry--
544;00:39:36,401;00:39:39,803;together we finished off
544;00:39:36,401;00:39:39,803;three chickens and a flagon of wine.
545;00:39:39,837;00:39:43,238;Impossible as it seems, there was a
545;00:39:39,837;00:39:43,238;time when I was unaccustomed to wine.
546;00:39:43,273;00:39:46,107;I forgot how afraid
546;00:39:43,273;00:39:46,107;I was around girls,
547;00:39:46,142;00:39:49,545;how I was always waiting
547;00:39:46,142;00:39:49,545;for them to laugh at me
548;00:39:49,579;00:39:52,013;or look away embarrassed
549;00:39:52,048;00:39:54,448;or ask me about my tall
549;00:39:52,048;00:39:54,448;handsome brother.
550;00:39:54,483;00:39:57,585;I forgot about
550;00:39:54,483;00:39:57,585;everything but Tysha.
551;00:39:58,853;00:40:01,221;And somehow I found
551;00:39:58,853;00:40:01,221;myself in her bed.
552;00:40:01,255;00:40:03,690;For three chickens,
552;00:40:01,255;00:40:03,690;I should hope so.
553;00:40:03,725;00:40:07,594;It didn't last long. I didn't know
553;00:40:03,725;00:40:07,594;what the hell I was doing.
554;00:40:07,629;00:40:10,230;But she was good to me.
555;00:40:10,265;00:40:12,366;She kissed me afterwards
556;00:40:12,400;00:40:15,302;and sang me a song.
557;00:40:15,336;00:40:20,441;And by morning I was deep enough
557;00:40:15,336;00:40:20,441;in love to ask for her hand.
558;00:40:20,475;00:40:23,177;A few lies, a few gold coins,
558;00:40:20,475;00:40:23,177;one drunken Septon
559;00:40:23,211;00:40:25,613;and there you have it--
559;00:40:23,211;00:40:25,613;man and wife.
560;00:40:25,647;00:40:29,250;For a fortnight anyway,
560;00:40:25,647;00:40:29,250;until the Septon sobered up
561;00:40:29,284;00:40:31,318;and told my father.
562;00:40:31,353;00:40:34,321;I imagine that was
562;00:40:31,353;00:40:34,321;the end of all that.
563;00:40:34,355;00:40:36,389;Not quite.
564;00:40:36,424;00:40:40,027;First, my father had
564;00:40:36,424;00:40:40,027;Jaime tell me the truth.
565;00:40:41,229;00:40:44,164;The girl was a whore,
565;00:40:41,229;00:40:44,164;you see.
566;00:40:45,734;00:40:47,668;Jaime had arranged
566;00:40:45,734;00:40:47,668;the whole thing,
567;00:40:47,702;00:40:50,537;the road, the rapers--
567;00:40:47,702;00:40:50,537;all of it.
568;00:40:50,572;00:40:53,173;He thought it was time
568;00:40:50,572;00:40:53,173;I had a woman.
569;00:40:55,143;00:40:57,311;After my brother confessed,
570;00:40:57,345;00:41:00,647;my father brought in my wife
571;00:41:00,682;00:41:03,450;and gave her
571;00:41:00,682;00:41:03,450;to his guards.
572;00:41:03,484;00:41:07,020;He paid her well--
572;00:41:03,484;00:41:07,020;a silver for each man.
573;00:41:07,054;00:41:10,023;How many whores command
573;00:41:07,054;00:41:10,023;that kind of price?
574;00:41:11,559;00:41:14,995;He brought me into the barracks
574;00:41:11,559;00:41:14,995;and made me watch.
575;00:41:15,029;00:41:18,431;By the end,
575;00:41:15,029;00:41:18,431;she had so much silver
576;00:41:18,465;00:41:21,400;that the coins were
576;00:41:18,465;00:41:21,400;slipping through her fingers
577;00:41:21,435;00:41:24,236;and rolling
577;00:41:21,435;00:41:24,236;onto the floor.
578;00:41:26,974;00:41:29,976;I would have killed the man
578;00:41:26,974;00:41:29,976;who did that to me.
579;00:41:30,010;00:41:33,246;You should have known
579;00:41:30,010;00:41:33,246;she was a whore.
580;00:41:33,280;00:41:35,581;Really?
581;00:41:35,615;00:41:38,451;I was 16, drunk
581;00:41:35,615;00:41:38,451;and in love--
582;00:41:38,485;00:41:40,386;A girl who
582;00:41:38,485;00:41:40,386;was almost raped
583;00:41:40,421;00:41:43,389;doesn't invite another man
583;00:41:40,421;00:41:43,389;into her bed two hours later.
584;00:41:44,991;00:41:49,294;As I said, I was
584;00:41:44,991;00:41:49,294;young and stupid.
585;00:41:51,497;00:41:53,932;You are still
585;00:41:51,497;00:41:53,932;young and stupid.
586;00:42:17,255;00:42:19,456;Hyah!
587;00:42:35,673;00:42:37,307;What is it?
587;00:42:35,673;00:42:37,307;What do you want?
588;00:42:37,341;00:42:39,176;You're sleeping
588;00:42:37,341;00:42:39,176;through the war.
589;00:42:39,210;00:42:42,112;What?
589;00:42:39,210;00:42:42,112;They stole a night's march on us.
590;00:42:42,146;00:42:44,380;They're a mile north.
591;00:42:44,415;00:42:47,016;Get my squire!
591;00:42:44,415;00:42:47,016;You don't have a squire.
592;00:42:49,386;00:42:51,720;If I die, weep for me.
593;00:42:52,955;00:42:56,057;You'll be dead.
593;00:42:52,955;00:42:56,057;How will you know?
594;00:43:02,101;00:43:04,068;I'll know.
595;00:43:05,904;00:43:07,771;Watch out!
595;00:43:05,904;00:43:07,771;Move!
596;00:43:08,807;00:43:10,374;Out of the way!
597;00:43:10,408;00:43:12,777;Move aside!
597;00:43:10,408;00:43:12,777;( Neighs
598;00:43:18,919;00:43:20,786;stay low.
599;00:43:20,821;00:43:22,922;Stay low?
600;00:43:22,956;00:43:25,524;If you're lucky,
600;00:43:22,956;00:43:25,524;no one will notice you.
601;00:43:25,558;00:43:28,094;I was born lucky.
602;00:43:30,797;00:43:32,999;Tribesmen of the Vale,
603;00:43:33,033;00:43:35,869;gather round!
604;00:43:35,903;00:43:38,405;Stone Crows!
605;00:43:38,440;00:43:40,707;Black Ears!
605;00:43:38,440;00:43:40,707;Burned Men!
606;00:43:40,741;00:43:43,477;Moon brothers!
606;00:43:40,741;00:43:43,477;Man: And painted dogs!
607;00:43:43,511;00:43:45,879;And painted dogs!
608;00:43:45,913;00:43:49,382;Your dominion over
608;00:43:45,913;00:43:49,382;the Vale begins now!
609;00:43:49,416;00:43:52,285;Onward to claim
609;00:43:49,416;00:43:52,285;what is yours!
610;00:43:52,319;00:43:54,754;Half man! Half man!

613;00:44:00,993;00:44:02,927;To battle.
614;00:44:45,165;00:44:47,500;You're a shit warrior.
615;00:44:49,536;00:44:51,503;I'm alive?
616;00:44:51,538;00:44:54,872;You're alive.
617;00:44:59,478;00:45:01,278;Did we win?
618;00:45:01,313;00:45:03,914;We wouldn't be having
618;00:45:01,313;00:45:03,914;this conversation if we didn't.
619;00:45:16,793;00:45:19,595;How did our
619;00:45:16,793;00:45:19,595;tribesmen do?
620;00:45:20,731;00:45:22,932;Yeah, good.
621;00:45:22,967;00:45:26,102;It's nice to see them
621;00:45:22,967;00:45:26,102;getting along.
622;00:45:26,136;00:45:28,204;You're wounded.
623;00:45:28,239;00:45:31,439;Good of you to notice.
624;00:45:31,473;00:45:33,574;I hear we won.
625;00:45:33,608;00:45:36,243;Hmph.
625;00:45:33,608;00:45:36,243;The scouts were wrong.
626;00:45:36,277;00:45:40,313;There were 2,000
626;00:45:36,277;00:45:40,313;Stark bannermen, not 20,000.
627;00:45:41,448;00:45:43,483;Did we get the Stark boy,
627;00:45:41,448;00:45:43,483;at least?
628;00:45:43,517;00:45:45,551;He wasn't here.
629;00:45:45,586;00:45:47,420;Where was he?
630;00:45:47,454;00:45:50,122;With his other 18,000 men.
631;00:45:53,025;00:45:55,493;And where are they?
632;00:46:05,602;00:46:07,938;We should go, My Lady.
632;00:46:05,602;00:46:07,938;No!
633;00:46:12,775;00:46:15,410;My Lady!
634;00:46:16,612;00:46:19,146;Hyah hyah!
635;00:46:50,439;00:46:54,175;By the time they knew what was
635;00:46:50,439;00:46:54,175;happening, it had already happened.
636;00:46:57,412;00:46:59,613;Lady Stark.
636;00:46:57,412;00:46:59,613;I'd offer you my sword,
637;00:46:59,648;00:47:01,648;but I seem
637;00:46:59,648;00:47:01,648;to have lost it.
638;00:47:01,682;00:47:04,216;It's not your sword I want.
639;00:47:04,251;00:47:06,885;Give me my daughters back.
640;00:47:06,952;00:47:09,020;Give me my husband.
641;00:47:09,054;00:47:11,255;I've lost them too,
641;00:47:09,054;00:47:11,255;I'm afraid.
642;00:47:11,289;00:47:13,857;Kill him, Robb.
642;00:47:11,289;00:47:13,857;Send his head to his father.
643;00:47:13,891;00:47:16,059;He cut down 10 of our men--
643;00:47:13,891;00:47:16,059;you saw him.
644;00:47:16,093;00:47:18,995;He's more use
644;00:47:16,093;00:47:18,995;to us alive than dead.
645;00:47:19,029;00:47:22,097;Take him away
645;00:47:19,029;00:47:22,097;and put him in irons.
646;00:47:22,132;00:47:24,900;We could end this war
646;00:47:22,132;00:47:24,900;right now, boy,
647;00:47:24,934;00:47:26,968;save thousands of lives.
648;00:47:27,003;00:47:29,871;You fight for the Starks,
648;00:47:27,003;00:47:29,871;I fight for the Lannisters.
649;00:47:29,906;00:47:33,173;Swords or lances, teeth, nails--
649;00:47:29,906;00:47:33,173;choose your weapons
650;00:47:33,207;00:47:35,775;and let's end this
650;00:47:33,207;00:47:35,775;here and now.
651;00:47:37,977;00:47:40,645;If we do it your way,
651;00:47:37,977;00:47:40,645;Kingslayer,
652;00:47:40,680;00:47:43,380;you'd win.
653;00:47:45,583;00:47:47,751;We're not doing it
653;00:47:45,583;00:47:47,751;your way.
654;00:47:49,687;00:47:51,787;Come on, pretty man.
655;00:48:00,163;00:48:02,965;I sent 2,000 men
655;00:48:00,163;00:48:02,965;to their graves today.
656;00:48:02,999;00:48:05,534;The bards will sing songs
656;00:48:02,999;00:48:05,534;of their sacrifice.
657;00:48:05,568;00:48:08,804;Aye. But the dead
657;00:48:05,568;00:48:08,804;won't hear them.
658;00:48:15,644;00:48:18,346;One victory does not
658;00:48:15,644;00:48:18,346;make us conquerors.
659;00:48:20,282;00:48:22,917;Did we free my father?
660;00:48:22,951;00:48:25,853;Did we rescue my sisters
660;00:48:22,951;00:48:25,853;from the Queen?
661;00:48:27,489;00:48:31,026;Did we free the North from those
661;00:48:27,489;00:48:31,026;who want us on our knees?
662;00:48:35,731;00:48:38,798;This war is far from over.
663;00:49:08,928;00:49:10,895;Could I have one?
664;00:49:10,930;00:49:13,531;A lemon one--
664;00:49:10,930;00:49:13,531;or any of them.
665;00:49:13,565;00:49:15,099;Three coppers.
666;00:49:16,168;00:49:17,701;How about
666;00:49:16,168;00:49:17,701;a nice fat pigeon?
667;00:49:17,736;00:49:19,636;Piss off now.
667;00:49:17,736;00:49:19,636;Go on.
668;00:49:19,671;00:49:22,539;Do you have any stale ones
668;00:49:19,671;00:49:22,539;from yesterday?
669;00:49:22,574;00:49:24,708;Or any burnt ones?
669;00:49:22,574;00:49:24,708;Piss off!
670;00:49:32,151;00:49:34,519;Hey, where's everyone going?
670;00:49:32,151;00:49:34,519;What's happening?
671;00:49:34,553;00:49:36,003;They're taking him
671;00:49:34,553;00:49:36,003;to the Sept of Baelor.
672;00:49:36,004;00:49:36,897;Who?
673;00:49:36,898;00:49:38,832;The Hand of the King.
674;00:50:46,393;00:50:48,625;Traitor!
674;00:50:46,393;00:50:48,625;Coward!
675;00:50:48,659;00:50:50,527;Baelor.
676;00:50:50,561;00:50:52,194;Baelor!
677;00:50:57,867;00:51:00,502;Traitor!
677;00:50:57,867;00:51:00,502;Traitor!
678;00:51:20,453;00:51:22,554;I am Eddard Stark,
679;00:51:22,588;00:51:24,988;Lord of Winterfell
680;00:51:25,023;00:51:27,190;and Hand of the King.
681;00:51:36,032;00:51:38,533;I come before you
681;00:51:36,032;00:51:38,533;to confess my treason
682;00:51:38,567;00:51:41,969;in the sight of Gods
682;00:51:38,567;00:51:41,969;and men.
683;00:51:43,338;00:51:45,406;I betrayed the faith
683;00:51:43,338;00:51:45,406;of my King
684;00:51:45,440;00:51:48,809;and the trust
684;00:51:45,440;00:51:48,809;of my friend Robert.
685;00:51:50,078;00:51:53,213;I swore to protect
685;00:51:50,078;00:51:53,213;and defend his children,
686;00:51:53,247;00:51:55,615;but before his blood
686;00:51:53,247;00:51:55,615;was cold
687;00:51:55,649;00:51:58,150;I plotted
687;00:51:55,649;00:51:58,150;to murder his son...
688;00:51:59,585;00:52:01,920;And seize the Throne
688;00:51:59,585;00:52:01,920;for myself.
689;00:52:01,954;00:52:04,589;Traitor!
690;00:52:12,829;00:52:14,897;Let the high Septon
691;00:52:14,931;00:52:18,534;and Baelor the blessed
691;00:52:14,931;00:52:18,534;bear witness to what I say:
692;00:52:21,038;00:52:23,573;Joffrey Baratheon
693;00:52:23,607;00:52:26,442;is the one true heir
693;00:52:23,607;00:52:26,442;to the Iron Throne,
694;00:52:26,476;00:52:30,112;by the Grace
694;00:52:26,476;00:52:30,112;of all the gods,
695;00:52:30,146;00:52:32,681;Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
696;00:52:32,715;00:52:34,983;and Protector
696;00:52:32,715;00:52:34,983;of the Realm.
697;00:52:41,358;00:52:44,627;As we sin,
698;00:52:44,695;00:52:46,596;so do we suffer.
699;00:52:46,630;00:52:49,499;This man has
699;00:52:46,630;00:52:49,499;confessed his crimes
700;00:52:49,533;00:52:52,202;in sight
700;00:52:49,533;00:52:52,202;of Gods and men.
701;00:52:52,236;00:52:55,738;The Gods are just
702;00:52:55,773;00:52:58,608;but beloved Baelor
702;00:52:55,773;00:52:58,608;taught us
703;00:52:58,642;00:53:02,444;they can also be
703;00:52:58,642;00:53:02,444;merciful.
704;00:53:05,182;00:53:06,849;What is to be done
705;00:53:06,883;00:53:09,351;with this traitor,
705;00:53:06,883;00:53:09,351;Your Grace?
706;00:53:14,258;00:53:17,360;My mother wishes me to let
706;00:53:14,258;00:53:17,360;Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch.
707;00:53:17,395;00:53:20,063;Stripped of all titles
707;00:53:17,395;00:53:20,063;and powers,
708;00:53:20,097;00:53:22,733;he would serve the realm
708;00:53:20,097;00:53:22,733;in permanent exile.
709;00:53:22,767;00:53:24,468;And My Lady Sansa

710;00:53:24,502;00:53:27,971;for her father.
711;00:53:31,509;00:53:34,644;But they have
711;00:53:31,509;00:53:34,644;the soft hearts of women.
712;00:53:34,679;00:53:37,213;So long as I am your King,
713;00:53:37,248;00:53:41,151;treason shall never
713;00:53:37,248;00:53:41,151;go unpunished.
714;00:53:41,185;00:53:43,252;Ser Ilyn,
