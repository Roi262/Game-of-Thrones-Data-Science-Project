4;00:02:39,873;00:02:41,997;I believe we last saw each other
4;00:02:39,873;00:02:41,997;atop the Wall.
5;00:02:41,998;00:02:45,914;You were pissing off the edge
5;00:02:41,998;00:02:45,914;if I remember right.
6;00:02:45,915;00:02:48,372;Picked up some scars
6;00:02:45,915;00:02:48,372;along the road.
7;00:02:48,373;00:02:52,873;It's been a long road,
7;00:02:48,373;00:02:52,873;but we're both still here.

9;00:02:56,373;00:03:00,205;Ah, the Onion Knight.
10;00:03:00,206;00:03:03,288;We fought on opposite sides at
10;00:03:00,206;00:03:03,288;the Battle of Blackwater Bay.
11;00:03:03,289;00:03:05,872;Unluckily for me.

16;00:03:17,498;00:03:20,248;handing over your weapons.
17;00:03:25,873;00:03:27,248;Of course.

19;00:03:51,873;00:03:53,415;Please, this way.

21;00:03:59,748;00:04:02,038;I can't place
21;00:03:59,748;00:04:02,038;the accent.
22;00:04:02,039;00:04:03,872;I was born on
22;00:04:02,039;00:04:03,872;the Island of Naath.
23;00:04:03,873;00:04:06,956;Ah. I hear it's beautiful
23;00:04:03,873;00:04:06,956;down there.
24;00:04:06,957;00:04:09,038;Palm trees
24;00:04:06,957;00:04:09,038;and butterflies.
25;00:04:09,039;00:04:10,456;Haven't been, myself.
26;00:04:14,623;00:04:16,415;This place has changed.
27;00:04:22,790;00:04:25,914;Tyrion: And Sansa?
27;00:04:22,790;00:04:25,914;I hear she's alive and well.
28;00:04:25,915;00:04:28,415;Jon: She is.
28;00:04:25,915;00:04:28,415;Does she miss me terribly?
29;00:04:31,581;00:04:33,997;A sham marriage.
29;00:04:31,581;00:04:33,997;And unconsummated.
30;00:04:33,998;00:04:37,163;I didn't ask.
30;00:04:33,998;00:04:37,163;Well, it was. Wasn't.
31;00:04:37,164;00:04:39,080;Anyway...
32;00:04:39,081;00:04:41,914;she's much smarter
32;00:04:39,081;00:04:41,914;than she lets on.
33;00:04:41,915;00:04:44,288;She's starting
33;00:04:41,915;00:04:44,288;to let on.
34;00:04:44,289;00:04:45,206;Good.
35;00:04:45,207;00:04:47,247;Tyrion:
35;00:04:45,207;00:04:47,247;At some point,
36;00:04:47,248;00:04:51,205;I want to hear how a Night's Watch recruit
36;00:04:47,248;00:04:51,205;became King in the North.
37;00:04:51,206;00:04:52,997;As long as you tell me
37;00:04:51,206;00:04:52,997;how a Lannister
38;00:04:52,998;00:04:55,789;became Hand
38;00:04:52,998;00:04:55,789;to Daenerys Targaryen.
39;00:04:55,790;00:04:57,914;A long
39;00:04:55,790;00:04:57,914;and bloody tale.
40;00:04:57,915;00:05:00,665;To be honest,
40;00:04:57,915;00:05:00,665;I was drunk for most of it.
41;00:05:03,289;00:05:05,831;My bannermen think
41;00:05:03,289;00:05:05,831;I'm a fool for coming here.
42;00:05:05,832;00:05:07,247;Of course they do.
43;00:05:07,248;00:05:09,957;If I was your Hand,
43;00:05:07,248;00:05:09,957;I would have advised against it.
44;00:05:12,581;00:05:14,497;General rule of thumb--
45;00:05:14,498;00:05:17,622;Stark men don't fare well
45;00:05:14,498;00:05:17,622;when they travel south.
46;00:05:17,623;00:05:19,372;True...
47;00:05:19,373;00:05:21,497;but I'm not a Stark.
48;00:05:21,498;00:05:24,832;( screeching )

50;00:05:35,748;00:05:36,998;I'd say you get
50;00:05:35,748;00:05:36,998;used to them...
51;00:05:39,748;00:05:41,206;but you never
51;00:05:39,748;00:05:41,206;really do.
52;00:05:44,748;00:05:47,998;Come, their mother
52;00:05:44,748;00:05:47,998;is waiting for you.
53;00:06:00,373;00:06:03,956;I wondered why you weren't there
53;00:06:00,373;00:06:03,956;to meet our guests.
54;00:06:03,957;00:06:06,956;You begged us to summon
54;00:06:03,957;00:06:06,956;the King in the North.
55;00:06:06,957;00:06:09,414;Don't you want
55;00:06:06,957;00:06:09,414;to see him again?
56;00:06:09,415;00:06:12,038;I've done my part.
57;00:06:12,039;00:06:14,455;I've brought
57;00:06:12,039;00:06:14,455;ice and fire together.
58;00:06:14,456;00:06:16,747;Strange.
59;00:06:16,748;00:06:19,247;You spoke so highly
59;00:06:16,748;00:06:19,247;of Jon Snow,
60;00:06:19,248;00:06:22,914;but when he arrives,
60;00:06:19,248;00:06:22,914;you hide on a cliff.
61;00:06:22,915;00:06:25,288;I didn't take you
61;00:06:22,915;00:06:25,288;for a bashful girl.
62;00:06:25,289;00:06:29,497;My time whispering in the ears of kings
62;00:06:25,289;00:06:29,497;has come to an end.
63;00:06:29,498;00:06:31,914;Oh, I doubt that.
64;00:06:31,915;00:06:34,539;Give us common folk
64;00:06:31,915;00:06:34,539;one taste of power,
65;00:06:34,540;00:06:37,372;we're like the lion
65;00:06:34,540;00:06:37,372;who tasted man.
66;00:06:37,373;00:06:40,622;Nothing is ever
66;00:06:37,373;00:06:40,622;so sweet again.
67;00:06:40,623;00:06:43,873;Neither of us
67;00:06:40,623;00:06:43,873;is common folk anymore.
68;00:06:45,998;00:06:47,789;I did not part
68;00:06:45,998;00:06:47,789;on good terms
69;00:06:47,790;00:06:50,789;with the King in the North
69;00:06:47,790;00:06:50,789;or his advisor.
70;00:06:50,790;00:06:51,790;Why?
71;00:06:53,456;00:06:55,498;Because of
71;00:06:53,456;00:06:55,498;mistakes I made.
72;00:06:57,623;00:06:59,498;Terrible mistakes.
73;00:07:01,331;00:07:04,455;I would only be
73;00:07:01,331;00:07:04,455;a distraction if I stayed.
74;00:07:04,456;00:07:06,664;So, where will you go?
74;00:07:04,456;00:07:06,664;Volantis.
75;00:07:06,665;00:07:08,664;Good.
76;00:07:08,665;00:07:10,914;If you don't mind
76;00:07:08,665;00:07:10,914;my saying,
77;00:07:10,915;00:07:14,664;I don't think you should
77;00:07:10,915;00:07:14,664;return to Westeros.
78;00:07:14,665;00:07:17,123;I'm not sure
78;00:07:14,665;00:07:17,123;you'd be safe here.
79;00:07:19,039;00:07:22,247;Oh, I will return,

98;00:08:59,581;00:09:01,414;He's not a lord.
98;00:08:59,581;00:09:01,414;Forgive me--

125;00:10:07,331;00:10:08,664;He would have burned
125;00:10:07,331;00:10:08,664;the Seven Kingdoms--
126;00:10:08,665;00:10:11,748;My father...
126;00:10:08,665;00:10:11,748;was an evil man.
127;00:10:13,581;00:10:15,790;On behalf
127;00:10:13,581;00:10:15,790;of House Targaryen...
128;00:10:17,039;00:10:18,664;I ask your forgiveness
129;00:10:18,665;00:10:21,622;for the crimes he committed
129;00:10:18,665;00:10:21,622;against your family.
130;00:10:21,623;00:10:24,497;And I ask you
130;00:10:21,623;00:10:24,497;not to judge a daughter
131;00:10:24,498;00:10:26,873;by the sins
131;00:10:24,498;00:10:26,873;of her father.
132;00:10:28,331;00:10:31,831;Our two houses
132;00:10:28,331;00:10:31,831;were allies for centuries,
133;00:10:31,832;00:10:33,706;and those were
133;00:10:31,832;00:10:33,706;the best centuries
134;00:10:33,707;00:10:35,831;the Seven Kingdoms
134;00:10:33,707;00:10:35,831;have ever known.
135;00:10:35,832;00:10:38,330;Centuries of peace
135;00:10:35,832;00:10:38,330;and prosperity
136;00:10:38,331;00:10:41,163;with a Targaryen
136;00:10:38,331;00:10:41,163;sitting on the Iron Throne
137;00:10:41,164;00:10:45,163;and a Stark serving
137;00:10:41,164;00:10:45,163;as Warden of the North.
138;00:10:45,164;00:10:48,914;I am the last Targaryen,
138;00:10:45,164;00:10:48,914;Jon Snow.
139;00:10:48,915;00:10:51,330;Honor the pledge
139;00:10:48,915;00:10:51,330;your ancestor made to mine.
140;00:10:51,331;00:10:54,997;Bend the knee and I will name you
140;00:10:51,331;00:10:54,997;Warden of the North.
141;00:10:54,998;00:10:57,205;Together, we will
141;00:10:54,998;00:10:57,205;save this country
142;00:10:57,206;00:10:59,832;from those
142;00:10:57,206;00:10:59,832;who would destroy it.
143;00:11:09,665;00:11:11,706;You're right.
144;00:11:11,707;00:11:14,205;You're not guilty
144;00:11:11,707;00:11:14,205;of your father's crimes.
145;00:11:14,206;00:11:19,038;And I'm not beholden
145;00:11:14,206;00:11:19,038;to my ancestor's vows.
146;00:11:19,039;00:11:21,038;Then why are you here?
147;00:11:21,039;00:11:23,873;Because I need your help,
147;00:11:21,039;00:11:23,873;and you need mine.
148;00:11:27,081;00:11:29,038;Did you see
148;00:11:27,081;00:11:29,038;three dragons
149;00:11:29,039;00:11:30,997;flying overhead
149;00:11:29,039;00:11:30,997;when you arrived?
150;00:11:30,998;00:11:32,080;I did.
151;00:11:32,081;00:11:34,372;And did you see
151;00:11:32,081;00:11:34,372;the Dothraki,
152;00:11:34,373;00:11:36,580;all of whom have sworn
152;00:11:34,373;00:11:36,580;to kill for me?
153;00:11:36,581;00:11:38,539;They're hard to miss.
154;00:11:38,540;00:11:42,580;But still, I need your help?
154;00:11:38,540;00:11:42,580;Davos: Not to defeat Cersei.
155;00:11:42,581;00:11:45,914;You could storm King's Landing tomorrow
155;00:11:42,581;00:11:45,914;and the city would fall.
156;00:11:45,915;00:11:48,163;Hell, we almost took it
156;00:11:45,915;00:11:48,163;and we didn't even have dragons.
157;00:11:48,164;00:11:52,288;Almost.
157;00:11:48,164;00:11:52,288;But you haven't stormed King's Landing.
158;00:11:52,289;00:11:53,914;Why not?
159;00:11:53,915;00:11:55,622;The only reason
159;00:11:53,915;00:11:55,622;I can see
160;00:11:55,623;00:11:57,872;is you don't want to kill
160;00:11:55,623;00:11:57,872;thousands of innocent people.
161;00:11:57,873;00:11:59,914;It's the fastest way
161;00:11:57,873;00:11:59,914;to win the war,
162;00:11:59,915;00:12:01,747;but you won't do it,
163;00:12:01,748;00:12:04,956;which means,
163;00:12:01,748;00:12:04,956;at the very least,
164;00:12:04,957;00:12:06,415;you're better
164;00:12:04,957;00:12:06,415;than Cersei.
165;00:12:07,915;00:12:11,289;Still, that doesn't explain
165;00:12:07,915;00:12:11,289;why I need your help.
166;00:12:13,164;00:12:17,789;Because right now,
166;00:12:13,164;00:12:17,789;you and I and Cersei and everyone else,
167;00:12:17,790;00:12:19,414;we're children
167;00:12:17,790;00:12:19,414;playing at a game,
168;00:12:19,415;00:12:21,497;screaming that
168;00:12:19,415;00:12:21,497;the rules aren't fair.
169;00:12:21,498;00:12:23,622;You told me you liked this man.
169;00:12:21,498;00:12:23,622;I do.
170;00:12:23,623;00:12:27,122;In the time since he's met me,
170;00:12:23,623;00:12:27,122;he's refused to call me queen,
171;00:12:27,123;00:12:29,997;he's refused to bow,
171;00:12:27,123;00:12:29,997;and now he's calling me a child.
172;00:12:29,998;00:12:33,789;I believe he's calling all of us children.
172;00:12:29,998;00:12:33,789;Figure of speech.
173;00:12:33,790;00:12:37,122;Your Grace, everyone you know will die
173;00:12:33,790;00:12:37,122;before winter's over
174;00:12:37,123;00:12:39,288;if we don't defeat
174;00:12:37,123;00:12:39,288;the enemy to the north.
175;00:12:39,289;00:12:41,956;As far as I can see,
175;00:12:39,289;00:12:41,956;you  are the enemy to the north.
176;00:12:41,957;00:12:43,623;I am not your enemy.
177;00:12:45,039;00:12:46,956;The dead
177;00:12:45,039;00:12:46,956;are the enemy.
178;00:12:46,957;00:12:48,498;The dead?
179;00:12:49,790;00:12:51,372;Is that another
179;00:12:49,790;00:12:51,372;figure of speech?
180;00:12:51,373;00:12:52,997;The Army of the Dead
180;00:12:51,373;00:12:52,997;is on the march.
181;00:12:52,998;00:12:55,080;The Army of the Dead?
182;00:12:55,081;00:12:57,247;You don't
182;00:12:55,081;00:12:57,247;know me well, my lord,
183;00:12:57,248;00:13:00,580;but do you think
183;00:12:57,248;00:13:00,580;I'm a liar or a madman?
184;00:13:00,581;00:13:03,122;No, I don't think
184;00:13:00,581;00:13:03,122;you're either of those things.
185;00:13:03,123;00:13:05,247;The Army of the Dead
185;00:13:03,123;00:13:05,247;is real.
186;00:13:05,248;00:13:06,706;The white walkers
186;00:13:05,248;00:13:06,706;are real.
187;00:13:06,707;00:13:09,622;The Night King is real.
187;00:13:06,707;00:13:09,622;I've seen them.
188;00:13:09,623;00:13:11,163;If they get
188;00:13:09,623;00:13:11,163;past the Wall
189;00:13:11,164;00:13:13,665;and we're squabbling
189;00:13:11,164;00:13:13,665;amongst ourselves...
190;00:13:16,707;00:13:18,289;we're finished.
191;00:13:23,873;00:13:26,164;I was born
191;00:13:23,873;00:13:26,164;at Dragonstone.
192;00:13:27,790;00:13:30,497;Not that I can
192;00:13:27,790;00:13:30,497;remember it.
193;00:13:30,498;00:13:33,956;We fled before
193;00:13:30,498;00:13:33,956;Robert's assassins could find us.
194;00:13:33,957;00:13:37,163;Robert was your father's
194;00:13:33,957;00:13:37,163;best friend, no?
195;00:13:37,164;00:13:40,997;I wonder if your father knew
195;00:13:37,164;00:13:40,997;his best friend sent assassins
196;00:13:40,998;00:13:43,540;to murder a baby girl
196;00:13:40,998;00:13:43,540;in her crib.
197;00:13:44,998;00:13:46,915;Not that it matters now,
197;00:13:44,998;00:13:46,915;of course.
198;00:13:48,456;00:13:51,997;I spent my life
198;00:13:48,456;00:13:51,997;in foreign lands.
199;00:13:51,998;00:13:54,372;So many men
199;00:13:51,998;00:13:54,372;have tried to kill me,
200;00:13:54,373;00:13:57,872;I don't remember
200;00:13:54,373;00:13:57,872;all their names.
201;00:13:57,873;00:14:01,956;I have been sold
201;00:13:57,873;00:14:01,956;like a broodmare.
202;00:14:01,957;00:14:05,497;I've been chained
202;00:14:01,957;00:14:05,497;and betrayed,
203;00:14:05,498;00:14:08,288;raped and defiled.
204;00:14:08,289;00:14:10,539;Do you know
204;00:14:08,289;00:14:10,539;what kept me standing
205;00:14:10,540;00:14:13,497;through all those years
205;00:14:10,540;00:14:13,497;in exile?
206;00:14:13,498;00:14:16,455;Faith.
207;00:14:16,456;00:14:18,706;Not in any gods,
208;00:14:18,707;00:14:22,247;not in myths
208;00:14:18,707;00:14:22,247;and legends.
209;00:14:22,248;00:14:24,872;In myself.
210;00:14:24,873;00:14:28,038;In Daenerys Targaryen.
211;00:14:28,039;00:14:31,580;The world hadn't seen
211;00:14:28,039;00:14:31,580;a dragon in centuries
212;00:14:31,581;00:14:33,956;until my children
212;00:14:31,581;00:14:33,956;were born.
213;00:14:33,957;00:14:38,747;The Dothraki hadn't
213;00:14:33,957;00:14:38,747;crossed the sea, any sea.
214;00:14:38,748;00:14:41,122;They did for me.
215;00:14:41,123;00:14:45,580;I was born to rule
215;00:14:41,123;00:14:45,580;the Seven Kingdoms,
216;00:14:45,581;00:14:47,707;and I will.
217;00:14:50,039;00:14:52,580;You'll be ruling
217;00:14:50,039;00:14:52,580;over a graveyard
218;00:14:52,581;00:14:54,915;if we don't defeat
218;00:14:52,581;00:14:54,915;the Night King.
219;00:14:56,331;00:14:59,539;The war against my sister
219;00:14:56,331;00:14:59,539;has already begun.
220;00:14:59,540;00:15:01,914;You can't expect us
220;00:14:59,540;00:15:01,914;to halt hostilities
221;00:15:01,915;00:15:03,747;and join you
221;00:15:01,915;00:15:03,747;in fighting
222;00:15:03,748;00:15:05,248;whatever you saw
222;00:15:03,748;00:15:05,248;beyond the Wall.
223;00:15:08,123;00:15:09,664;You don't believe him.
224;00:15:09,665;00:15:12,580;I understand that.
224;00:15:09,665;00:15:12,580;It sounds like nonsense.
225;00:15:12,581;00:15:16,372;But if destiny has brought
225;00:15:12,581;00:15:16,372;Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores,
226;00:15:16,373;00:15:19,580;it has also made Jon Snow
226;00:15:16,373;00:15:19,580;King in the North.
227;00:15:19,581;00:15:22,706;You were the first
227;00:15:19,581;00:15:22,706;to bring Dothraki to Westeros?
228;00:15:22,707;00:15:26,080;He is the first to make allies of
228;00:15:22,707;00:15:26,080;wildlings and Northmen.
229;00:15:26,081;00:15:28,163;He was named Lord Commander
229;00:15:26,081;00:15:28,163;of the Night's Watch.
230;00:15:28,164;00:15:29,247;He was named
230;00:15:28,164;00:15:29,247;King in the North.
231;00:15:29,248;00:15:30,622;Not because
231;00:15:29,248;00:15:30,622;of his birthright.
232;00:15:30,623;00:15:32,997;He has no birthright.
232;00:15:30,623;00:15:32,997;He's a damn bastard.
233;00:15:32,998;00:15:38,038;All those hard sons of bitches
233;00:15:32,998;00:15:38,038;chose him as their leader
234;00:15:38,039;00:15:39,748;because they
234;00:15:38,039;00:15:39,748;believe in him.
235;00:15:41,164;00:15:43,122;All those things
235;00:15:41,164;00:15:43,122;you don't believe in,
236;00:15:43,123;00:15:44,664;he faced
236;00:15:43,123;00:15:44,664;those things.
237;00:15:44,665;00:15:46,872;He fought those things
237;00:15:44,665;00:15:46,872;for the good of his people.
238;00:15:46,873;00:15:48,455;He risked his life

366;00:23:57,998;00:24:00,831;Now he's buried
366;00:23:57,998;00:24:00,831;somewhere.
367;00:24:00,832;00:24:03,580;And here's Ser Gregor,

368;00:24:03,581;00:24:05,498;That must be
368;00:24:03,581;00:24:05,498;difficult for you.
369;00:24:09,456;00:24:11,455;When my daughter
369;00:24:09,456;00:24:11,455;was taken from me,
370;00:24:11,456;00:24:14,580;my only daughter...
371;00:24:14,581;00:24:17,372;well, you can't
371;00:24:14,581;00:24:17,372;imagine how that feels
372;00:24:17,373;00:24:19,622;unless you've
372;00:24:17,373;00:24:19,622;lost a child.
373;00:24:19,623;00:24:22,288;I fed her at my own breast
373;00:24:19,623;00:24:22,288;even though they told me
374;00:24:22,289;00:24:24,997;to give her
374;00:24:22,289;00:24:24,997;to the wet nurse.
375;00:24:24,998;00:24:28,497;I couldn't bear to see her
375;00:24:24,998;00:24:28,497;in another woman's arms.
376;00:24:28,498;00:24:30,747;I never got
376;00:24:28,498;00:24:30,747;to have a mother,
377;00:24:30,748;00:24:32,163;but Myrcella did.
378;00:24:32,164;00:24:35,831;She was mine,
378;00:24:32,164;00:24:35,831;and you took her from me.
379;00:24:35,832;00:24:37,873;Why did you do that?
380;00:24:44,456;00:24:45,832;Doesn't matter now.
381;00:24:54,415;00:24:57,163;Your daughter's
381;00:24:54,415;00:24:57,163;a beauty, too.
382;00:24:57,164;00:24:59,789;Those brown eyes.
383;00:24:59,790;00:25:01,498;Those lips.
384;00:25:03,123;00:25:05,163;Perfect Dornish beauty.
385;00:25:05,164;00:25:07,038;I imagine
385;00:25:05,164;00:25:07,038;she's your favorite.
386;00:25:07,039;00:25:10,205;I know, I know,

387;00:25:10,206;00:25:12,373;we're only human.
388;00:25:13,873;00:25:15,455;We love whom we love.

391;00:25:20,331;00:25:23,706;That gag makes it impossible
391;00:25:20,331;00:25:23,706;to understand what you're saying.
392;00:25:23,707;00:25:25,540;It must be frustrating.
393;00:25:28,707;00:25:31,706;We all make
393;00:25:28,707;00:25:31,706;our choices.
394;00:25:31,707;00:25:34,122;You chose to murder
394;00:25:31,707;00:25:34,122;my daughter.
395;00:25:34,123;00:25:36,372;You must have felt powerful
395;00:25:34,123;00:25:36,372;after you made that choice.

396;00:25:36,373;00:25:38,581;Do you feel powerful now?
397;00:25:45,164;00:25:46,539;I don't sleep very well.
398;00:25:46,540;00:25:48,914;Not at all, really.
399;00:25:48,915;00:25:50,831;I lie in bed
399;00:25:48,915;00:25:50,831;and I stare at the canopy
400;00:25:50,832;00:25:53,205;and imagine ways
400;00:25:50,832;00:25:53,205;of killing my enemies.
401;00:25:53,206;00:25:57,081;How to destroy Ellaria Sand,

402;00:25:58,581;00:26:00,247;I thought about
402;00:25:58,581;00:26:00,247;having Ser Gregor

403;00:26:00,248;00:26:02,414;the way he did Oberyn's.
404;00:26:02,415;00:26:07,122;It would be poetic, I suppose,
404;00:26:02,415;00:26:07,122;but fast, too fast.
405;00:26:07,123;00:26:10,081;I thought about having him
405;00:26:07,123;00:26:10,081;crush your daughter's skull.
406;00:26:11,164;00:26:12,915;She's so beautiful.

408;00:26:15,832;00:26:18,247;like a duck egg,
409;00:26:18,248;00:26:19,998;no, it's just not right.

421;00:26:58,498;00:27:01,998;But death is certain?

487;00:31:36,665;00:31:39,205;now that Daenerys
487;00:31:36,665;00:31:39,205;has freed all the slaves?
488;00:31:39,206;00:31:43,372;The slave trade has
488;00:31:39,206;00:31:43,372;entered a downturn, it's true.
489;00:31:43,373;00:31:45,247;From what I gather,
489;00:31:43,373;00:31:45,247;she considers herself
490;00:31:45,248;00:31:48,580;more of a revolutionary
490;00:31:45,248;00:31:48,580;than a monarch.
491;00:31:48,581;00:31:52,497;In your experience, how do bankers
491;00:31:48,581;00:31:52,497;usually fare with revolutionaries?
492;00:31:52,498;00:31:55,497;The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank
492;00:31:52,498;00:31:55,497;quite a lot of money,
493;00:31:55,498;00:31:57,664;but Lannisters
493;00:31:55,498;00:31:57,664;always pay their debts.
494;00:31:57,665;00:32:02,081;Do former slaves
494;00:31:57,665;00:32:02,081;or Dothraki or dragons?
495;00:32:05,665;00:32:07,664;Your father's daughter,
495;00:32:05,665;00:32:07,664;indeed.
496;00:32:07,665;00:32:08,997;Give me a fortnight.
497;00:32:08,998;00:32:11,205;Stay in King's Landing
497;00:32:08,998;00:32:11,205;as my honored guest.
498;00:32:11,206;00:32:12,622;And when you
498;00:32:11,206;00:32:12,622;return to Braavos,
499;00:32:12,623;00:32:17,081;I swear to you, my debt
499;00:32:12,623;00:32:17,081;will be paid in full.
500;00:32:40,707;00:32:44,540;I came down here to brood over
500;00:32:40,707;00:32:44,540;my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.
501;00:32:47,081;00:32:48,622;You're making it
501;00:32:47,081;00:32:48,622;difficult.
502;00:32:48,623;00:32:52,289;You look a lot better
502;00:32:48,623;00:32:52,289;brooding than I do.
503;00:32:53,998;00:32:56,539;You make me feel like
503;00:32:53,998;00:32:56,539;I'm failing at brooding over failing.
504;00:32:56,540;00:32:58,247;I'm a prisoner
504;00:32:56,540;00:32:58,247;on this island.
505;00:32:58,248;00:33:02,205;I wouldn't say you're
505;00:32:58,248;00:33:02,205;a prisoner on this island.
506;00:33:02,206;00:33:03,706;You're free
506;00:33:02,206;00:33:03,706;to walk the castle,
507;00:33:03,707;00:33:05,622;the beaches,
507;00:33:03,707;00:33:05,622;to go wherever you want.
508;00:33:05,623;00:33:07,789;Except to my ship.
509;00:33:07,790;00:33:09,205;You took my ship.
510;00:33:09,206;00:33:11,163;I wouldn't say
510;00:33:09,206;00:33:11,163;we took your ship.
511;00:33:11,164;00:33:13,664;I'm not playing
511;00:33:11,164;00:33:13,664;word games with you.
512;00:33:13,665;00:33:15,539;The dead are coming
512;00:33:13,665;00:33:15,539;for us all.
513;00:33:15,540;00:33:17,205;Why don't you
513;00:33:15,540;00:33:17,205;figure out what to do
514;00:33:17,206;00:33:19,288;about my missing fleet
514;00:33:17,206;00:33:19,288;and murdered allies,
515;00:33:19,289;00:33:22,163;and I'll figure out what to do
515;00:33:19,289;00:33:22,163;about your walking dead men.
516;00:33:22,164;00:33:24,372;It's hard for me to fathom.
516;00:33:22,164;00:33:24,372;It really is.
517;00:33:24,373;00:33:27,498;If someone told me about the white walkers
517;00:33:24,373;00:33:27,498;and the Night King...
518;00:33:34,915;00:33:36,164;You probably
518;00:33:34,915;00:33:36,164;don't believe me.
519;00:33:38,623;00:33:40,789;I do, actually.
520;00:33:40,790;00:33:42,331;You didn't before.
521;00:33:44,039;00:33:46,247;Grumkins and snarks,
521;00:33:44,039;00:33:46,247;you called them.
522;00:33:46,248;00:33:48,330;Do you remember?
523;00:33:48,331;00:33:50,414;You said
523;00:33:48,331;00:33:50,414;it was all nonsense.
524;00:33:50,415;00:33:53,539;It was nonsense.
524;00:33:50,415;00:33:53,539;Everybody knew it.
525;00:33:53,540;00:33:56,664;But then Mormont
525;00:33:53,540;00:33:56,664;saw them
526;00:33:56,665;00:33:58,080;and you saw them.
527;00:33:58,081;00:33:59,747;And I trust the eyes
527;00:33:58,081;00:33:59,747;of an honest man
528;00:33:59,748;00:34:01,748;more than I trust
528;00:33:59,748;00:34:01,748;what everybody knows.
529;00:34:03,081;00:34:05,330;How do I convince people
529;00:34:03,081;00:34:05,330;who don't know me
530;00:34:05,331;00:34:08,080;that an enemy they don't believe in
530;00:34:05,331;00:34:08,080;is coming to kill them all?
531;00:34:08,081;00:34:11,414;Good question.
531;00:34:08,081;00:34:11,414;I know it's a good question.
532;00:34:11,415;00:34:13,580;I'm looking
532;00:34:11,415;00:34:13,580;for an answer.
533;00:34:13,581;00:34:17,872;People's minds aren't made for
533;00:34:13,581;00:34:17,872;problems that large.
534;00:34:17,873;00:34:20,330;White walkers,
534;00:34:17,873;00:34:20,330;the Night King,
535;00:34:20,331;00:34:22,414;Army of the Dead--
536;00:34:22,415;00:34:24,038;it's almost a relief
536;00:34:22,415;00:34:24,038;to confront
537;00:34:24,039;00:34:26,915;a comfortable,
537;00:34:24,039;00:34:26,915;familiar monster like my sister.
538;00:34:29,248;00:34:32,206;I need to help prepare my people
538;00:34:29,248;00:34:32,206;for what's coming.
539;00:34:33,915;00:34:36,248;I can't help them
539;00:34:33,915;00:34:36,248;from here.
540;00:34:37,748;00:34:38,998;I'd like to leave.
541;00:34:40,456;00:34:42,956;It seems unlikely that
541;00:34:40,456;00:34:42,956;you became King in the North
542;00:34:42,957;00:34:44,623;by giving up
542;00:34:42,957;00:34:44,623;that easily.
543;00:34:46,790;00:34:49,914;Everyone told me to learn
543;00:34:46,790;00:34:49,914;from my father's mistakes.
544;00:34:49,915;00:34:51,706;Don't go south.
545;00:34:51,707;00:34:54,372;Don't answer a summons
545;00:34:51,707;00:34:54,372;from the Mad King's daughter,
546;00:34:54,373;00:34:55,790;a foreign invader.
547;00:34:58,164;00:35:00,872;And here I am,
548;00:35:00,873;00:35:02,414;a Northern fool.
549;00:35:02,415;00:35:04,872;Children are not
549;00:35:02,415;00:35:04,872;their fathers,
550;00:35:04,873;00:35:06,581;luckily
550;00:35:04,873;00:35:06,581;for all of us.
551;00:35:08,081;00:35:10,288;And sometimes there's more
551;00:35:08,081;00:35:10,288;to foreign invaders
552;00:35:10,289;00:35:12,497;and Northern fools
552;00:35:10,289;00:35:12,497;than meets the eye.
553;00:35:12,498;00:35:16,706;Daenerys could have sailed
553;00:35:12,498;00:35:16,706;for Westeros long ago, but she didn't.
554;00:35:16,707;00:35:18,539;Instead, she stayed
554;00:35:16,707;00:35:18,539;where she was
555;00:35:18,540;00:35:21,205;and saved many people
555;00:35:18,540;00:35:21,205;from horrible fates,
556;00:35:21,206;00:35:23,539;some of whom are on this island
556;00:35:21,206;00:35:23,539;with us right now.
557;00:35:23,540;00:35:25,122;While you're
557;00:35:23,540;00:35:25,122;our guest here,
558;00:35:25,123;00:35:26,664;you might consider
558;00:35:25,123;00:35:26,664;asking them
559;00:35:26,665;00:35:29,414;what they think
559;00:35:26,665;00:35:29,414;of the Mad King's daughter.
560;00:35:29,415;00:35:32,497;She protects people
560;00:35:29,415;00:35:32,497;from monsters,
561;00:35:32,498;00:35:34,038;just as you do.
562;00:35:34,039;00:35:36,497;It's why she came here.
563;00:35:36,498;00:35:38,038;And she's not about
563;00:35:36,498;00:35:38,038;to head north
564;00:35:38,039;00:35:39,497;to fight an enemy
564;00:35:38,039;00:35:39,497;she's never seen
565;00:35:39,498;00:35:41,997;on the word of a man
565;00:35:39,498;00:35:41,997;she doesn't know.
566;00:35:41,998;00:35:44,414;After a single meeting,
567;00:35:44,415;00:35:47,206;it's not a reasonable
567;00:35:44,415;00:35:47,206;thing to ask.
568;00:35:53,581;00:35:55,832;So, do you have anything
568;00:35:53,581;00:35:55,832;reasonable to ask?
569;00:36:00,665;00:36:01,831;What do you mean?
570;00:36:01,832;00:36:04,080;Maybe you are
570;00:36:01,832;00:36:04,080;a Northern fool.
571;00:36:04,081;00:36:07,748;I'm asking if there's something
571;00:36:04,081;00:36:07,748;I can do to help you.
572;00:36:10,707;00:36:12,247;Dragonglass?
572;00:36:10,707;00:36:12,247;Tyrion: Yes.
573;00:36:12,248;00:36:14,706;Volcanic glass,
573;00:36:12,248;00:36:14,706;obsidian.
574;00:36:14,707;00:36:16,706;He says you have
574;00:36:14,707;00:36:16,706;a tremendous amount of it here.
575;00:36:16,707;00:36:18,497;Why are we talking
575;00:36:16,707;00:36:18,497;about glass?
576;00:36:18,498;00:36:20,372;We just lost
576;00:36:18,498;00:36:20,372;two of our allies.
577;00:36:20,373;00:36:23,748;Which is why I was
577;00:36:20,373;00:36:23,748;speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.
578;00:36:26,123;00:36:29,872;And what does the King in the North
578;00:36:26,123;00:36:29,872;want with dragonglass?
579;00:36:29,873;00:36:32,205;Apparently, it can be
579;00:36:29,873;00:36:32,205;turned into weapons
580;00:36:32,206;00:36:35,330;that kill white walkers
580;00:36:32,206;00:36:35,330;and their foot soldiers.
581;00:36:35,331;00:36:37,497;Or stop them.
582;00:36:37,498;00:36:38,789;Destroy them.
583;00:36:38,790;00:36:40,415;Unsure about
583;00:36:38,790;00:36:40,415;the nomenclature.
584;00:36:42,373;00:36:45,330;And what do you think
584;00:36:42,373;00:36:45,330;about this Army of the Dead
585;00:36:45,331;00:36:48,205;and white walkers
585;00:36:45,331;00:36:48,205;and Night Kings?
586;00:36:48,206;00:36:50,831;I'd very much like to believe
586;00:36:48,206;00:36:50,831;that Jon Snow is wrong.
587;00:36:50,832;00:36:54,080;But a wise man once said
587;00:36:50,832;00:36:54,080;that you should never believe a thing
588;00:36:54,081;00:36:56,623;simply because
588;00:36:54,081;00:36:56,623;you want to believe it.
589;00:36:59,331;00:37:02,497;Which wise man
589;00:36:59,331;00:37:02,497;said this?
590;00:37:02,498;00:37:04,372;I don't remember.
591;00:37:04,373;00:37:07,790;Are you trying to present
591;00:37:04,373;00:37:07,790;your own statements as ancient wisdom?
592;00:37:08,998;00:37:11,205;I would never do that.
593;00:37:11,206;00:37:12,248;To you.
594;00:37:14,081;00:37:17,747;The reason I believe Jon Snow
594;00:37:14,081;00:37:17,747;is because he's here.
595;00:37:17,748;00:37:20,163;All of his advisors
595;00:37:17,748;00:37:20,163;would have told him not to come.
596;00:37:20,164;00:37:22,247;I would have told him
596;00:37:20,164;00:37:22,247;not to come.
597;00:37:22,248;00:37:24,580;And he's here anyway.
598;00:37:24,581;00:37:26,997;You don't
598;00:37:24,581;00:37:26,997;have to believe him.
599;00:37:26,998;00:37:29,038;Let him mine
599;00:37:26,998;00:37:29,038;the dragonglass.
600;00:37:29,039;00:37:30,664;If he's wrong,
600;00:37:29,039;00:37:30,664;it's worthless.
601;00:37:30,665;00:37:32,747;You didn't even know

602;00:37:32,748;00:37:35,288;It's nothing to you.
603;00:37:35,289;00:37:38,580;Give him something
603;00:37:35,289;00:37:38,580;by giving him nothing.

608;00:37:49,873;00:37:51,664;Ser Davos said
609;00:37:51,665;00:37:55,706;about taking a knife in the heart

610;00:37:55,707;00:37:57,497;Did you notice that?
611;00:37:57,498;00:37:59,956;You must allow them

612;00:37:59,957;00:38:02,123;It's dreary
612;00:37:59,957;00:38:02,123;in the North.

617;00:38:28,957;00:38:30,331;two brothers as well.
618;00:38:33,498;00:38:36,373;People thought dragons
618;00:38:33,498;00:38:36,373;were gone forever, but here they are.
619;00:38:38,123;00:38:40,957;Perhaps we should all be examining
619;00:38:38,123;00:38:40,957;what we think we know.

640;00:40:20,581;00:40:24,247;it's enough food
640;00:40:20,581;00:40:24,247;for a year, perhaps more.
641;00:40:24,248;00:40:27,664;And what's the longest winter
641;00:40:24,248;00:40:27,664;in the past hundred years?
642;00:40:27,665;00:40:30,122;Uh, I'm not
642;00:40:27,665;00:40:30,122;entirely certain.

652;00:40:52,748;00:40:55,330;from every keep in the North.

655;00:40:59,957;00:41:03,664;to bring wagonloads of grain with them.
656;00:41:03,665;00:41:05,080;Very wise, my lady.

660;00:41:14,540;00:41:17,622;Once the real cold comes?
661;00:41:17,623;00:41:19,038;They should, indeed.

678;00:41:59,164;00:42:01,539;or life will win out.

725;00:45:42,289;00:45:44,123;Hmm.
726;00:45:49,581;00:45:51,455;Does it hurt?
727;00:45:51,456;00:45:54,164;A bit.
727;00:45:51,456;00:45:54,164;Less than before.
728;00:45:55,957;00:45:58,580;The infection no longer
728;00:45:55,957;00:45:58,580;appears to be active.

730;00:46:00,164;00:46:01,997;Unusual.
731;00:46:01,998;00:46:03,455;Unlikely.
732;00:46:03,456;00:46:05,455;One could almost
732;00:46:03,456;00:46:05,455;be forgiven
733;00:46:05,456;00:46:09,038;for thinking that the entire upper layer
733;00:46:05,456;00:46:09,038;of diseased skin was debrided
734;00:46:09,039;00:46:13,414;and the underlying region
734;00:46:09,039;00:46:13,414;treated with some sort of unguent.
735;00:46:13,415;00:46:16,706;Don't know
735;00:46:13,415;00:46:16,706;anything about that.
736;00:46:16,707;00:46:18,789;I just started
736;00:46:16,707;00:46:18,789;feeling better.
737;00:46:18,790;00:46:22,456;I assumed it was
737;00:46:18,790;00:46:22,456;the rest that did it.
738;00:46:24,415;00:46:27,038;And the climate.
739;00:46:27,039;00:46:28,997;The climate.
740;00:46:28,998;00:46:30,789;You're free
740;00:46:28,998;00:46:30,789;to go, ser.
741;00:46:30,790;00:46:32,831;This chamber is needed
741;00:46:30,790;00:46:32,831;for the infectious,
742;00:46:32,832;00:46:34,539;which you are
742;00:46:32,832;00:46:34,539;no longer.
743;00:46:34,540;00:46:38,039;Tarly, I'd like to speak with you
743;00:46:34,540;00:46:38,039;in my study this evening.
744;00:46:40,998;00:46:42,289;How bad is it?
745;00:46:43,957;00:46:45,331;Suppose I'll find out
745;00:46:43,957;00:46:45,331;this evening.
746;00:46:50,456;00:46:53,163;Where will you go?
746;00:46:50,456;00:46:53,163;( grunts )
747;00:46:53,164;00:46:56,873;I surrendered to this sickness
747;00:46:53,164;00:46:56,873;the moment I first saw it.
748;00:46:58,331;00:47:01,163;I knew
748;00:46:58,331;00:47:01,163;it would kill me
749;00:47:01,164;00:47:03,831;or I'd kill myself
749;00:47:01,164;00:47:03,831;before it could.
750;00:47:03,832;00:47:07,080;Daenerys Stormborn
750;00:47:03,832;00:47:07,080;convinced me otherwise.
751;00:47:07,081;00:47:10,706;The only place for me
751;00:47:07,081;00:47:10,706;is back with her.
752;00:47:10,707;00:47:13,122;I owe her my life.
753;00:47:13,123;00:47:15,706;Her and you.

755;00:47:17,915;00:47:20,247;Your father saved me
755;00:47:17,915;00:47:20,247;more than once.
756;00:47:20,248;00:47:22,039;It's the least
756;00:47:20,248;00:47:22,039;I could do.
757;00:47:23,540;00:47:26,914;Perhaps our paths
757;00:47:23,540;00:47:26,914;will cross again.
758;00:47:26,915;00:47:28,331;I hope they do.
759;00:47:55,456;00:47:56,441;Ebrose: You treated him?
760;00:47:56,465;00:47:57,918;Yes.
761;00:47:58,915;00:48:01,414;Who told you
761;00:47:58,915;00:48:01,414;to treat him?
762;00:48:01,415;00:48:02,747;No one.
763;00:48:02,748;00:48:06,038;Who forbade you, or anyone,
763;00:48:02,748;00:48:06,038;to attempt to treat him?
764;00:48:06,039;00:48:08,747;I seem
764;00:48:06,039;00:48:08,747;to remember you.
765;00:48:08,748;00:48:11,581;But you treated him anyway?
765;00:48:08,748;00:48:11,581;I did, yes.
766;00:48:13,248;00:48:16,372;I forbade it because it is dangerous
766;00:48:13,248;00:48:16,372;and rarely successful,
767;00:48:16,373;00:48:18,706;especially on
767;00:48:16,373;00:48:18,706;someone of that age.
768;00:48:18,707;00:48:20,914;You could have infected
768;00:48:18,707;00:48:20,914;yourself and others.
769;00:48:20,915;00:48:24,373;You could have devastated
769;00:48:20,915;00:48:24,373;the entire Citadel.
770;00:48:26,665;00:48:28,580;But you didn't.
771;00:48:28,581;00:48:31,205;It's a meticulous,
771;00:48:28,581;00:48:31,205;difficult procedure.
772;00:48:31,206;00:48:34,622;Many maesters whose chains are
772;00:48:31,206;00:48:34,622;heavy with healing links
773;00:48:34,623;00:48:37,080;have attempted it
773;00:48:34,623;00:48:37,080;and failed.
774;00:48:37,081;00:48:39,163;Yet you succeeded.
775;00:48:39,164;00:48:40,289;How?
776;00:48:42,289;00:48:45,581;I read the books
776;00:48:42,289;00:48:45,581;and followed the instructions.
777;00:48:55,957;00:48:58,164;That man is alive
777;00:48:55,957;00:48:58,164;because of you.
778;00:49:00,456;00:49:02,081;You should be proud.
779;00:49:05,164;00:49:07,664;Thank you,
779;00:49:05,164;00:49:07,664;Archmaester.
780;00:49:07,665;00:49:08,665;Come here.
781;00:49:12,623;00:49:16,288;All these manuscripts
781;00:49:12,623;00:49:16,288;and scrolls are rotting away.
782;00:49:16,289;00:49:18,957;I need you
782;00:49:16,289;00:49:18,957;to make copies of them.
783;00:49:23,248;00:49:25,331;You were expecting
783;00:49:23,248;00:49:25,331;a reward.
784;00:49:27,039;00:49:30,832;Your reward is not being
784;00:49:27,039;00:49:30,832;immediately expelled from the Citadel.
785;00:49:31,998;00:49:33,997;You'd better
785;00:49:31,998;00:49:33,997;get started.
786;00:49:33,998;00:49:35,664;And careful
786;00:49:33,998;00:49:35,664;of the paper mites.
787;00:49:35,665;00:49:36,998;They like flesh
787;00:49:35,665;00:49:36,998;as well.
788;00:49:44,248;00:49:47,622;We need to find
788;00:49:44,248;00:49:47,622;Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
789;00:49:47,623;00:49:51,122;Your Grace, he's already destroyed
789;00:49:47,623;00:49:51,122;a good portion of our fleet.
790;00:49:51,123;00:49:52,664;To send our
790;00:49:51,123;00:49:52,664;remaining ships after him--
791;00:49:52,665;00:49:55,331;I'm not talking about
791;00:49:52,665;00:49:55,331;sending our ships after him.
792;00:49:59,164;00:50:00,706;Would you have to go
792;00:49:59,164;00:50:00,706;yourself?
793;00:50:00,707;00:50:02,706;Euron's ships
793;00:50:00,707;00:50:02,706;could be anywhere
794;00:50:02,707;00:50:04,706;or in more than
794;00:50:02,707;00:50:04,706;one place.
795;00:50:04,707;00:50:07,122;You'd be flying around
795;00:50:04,707;00:50:07,122;the open seas alone
796;00:50:07,123;00:50:08,163;for who knows
796;00:50:07,123;00:50:08,163;how long.
797;00:50:08,164;00:50:09,789;I wouldn't be alone.
798;00:50:09,790;00:50:12,372;I would have Drogon,
798;00:50:09,790;00:50:12,372;Viserion, and Rhaegal.
799;00:50:12,373;00:50:14,163;What can anyone
799;00:50:12,373;00:50:14,163;do to them?
800;00:50:14,164;00:50:16,163;Missandei: They can still
800;00:50:14,164;00:50:16,163;do something to you.
801;00:50:16,164;00:50:17,956;It only takes
801;00:50:16,164;00:50:17,956;one arrow.
802;00:50:17,957;00:50:20,498;It's too great a risk.
802;00:50:17,957;00:50:20,498;You're too important.
803;00:50:22,832;00:50:24,956;What about
803;00:50:22,832;00:50:24,956;Casterly Rock?
804;00:50:24,957;00:50:26,914;The Unsullied
804;00:50:24,957;00:50:26,914;will be there soon.
805;00:50:26,915;00:50:29,497;And what will they face?
806;00:50:29,498;00:50:31,914;A difficult situation.
807;00:50:31,915;00:50:34,038;They know we're coming.
808;00:50:34,039;00:50:37,372;Yes. Cersei believes
808;00:50:34,039;00:50:37,372;my sole purpose in life
809;00:50:37,373;00:50:38,997;is to destroy

810;00:50:38,998;00:50:40,748;She will be ready.

813;00:50:49,748;00:50:52,080;Tyrion: Well-trained and well-provisioned.

815;00:50:53,873;00:50:54,873;They will see us coming.
816;00:50:59,415;00:51:01,080;They will be ready.

822;00:51:21,707;00:51:23,248;at a disadvantage.

823;00:51:24,623;00:51:26,289;Many men will die.
824;00:51:28,456;00:51:30,498;Just as my father
824;00:51:28,456;00:51:30,498;said they would.
825;00:51:32,665;00:51:35,288;Interesting thing
825;00:51:32,665;00:51:35,288;about my father--
826;00:51:35,289;00:51:37,205;he built our house up
826;00:51:35,289;00:51:37,205;from near ruin.
827;00:51:37,206;00:51:41,372;He built our army,
827;00:51:37,206;00:51:41,372;he built Casterly Rock as we know it,
828;00:51:41,373;00:51:43,455;but he didn't
828;00:51:41,373;00:51:43,455;build the sewers.
829;00:51:43,456;00:51:45,539;That was beneath him,
830;00:51:45,540;00:51:48,414;so he gave the job
830;00:51:45,540;00:51:48,414;to the lowest person he could find--
831;00:51:48,415;00:51:49,956;me.
832;00:51:49,957;00:51:51,789;He was right,
832;00:51:49,957;00:51:51,789;I was low.
833;00:51:51,790;00:51:53,914;The company I kept, low.
834;00:51:53,915;00:51:55,455;Women, mostly.
835;00:51:55,456;00:51:57,122;They weren't welcome
835;00:51:55,456;00:51:57,122;at the Rock.
836;00:51:57,123;00:51:59,414;Father disapproved
836;00:51:57,123;00:51:59,414;of that sort of behavior.
837;00:51:59,415;00:52:01,038;Couldn't walk them
837;00:51:59,415;00:52:01,038;through the front gates,
838;00:52:01,039;00:52:02,497;I couldn't have them
838;00:52:01,039;00:52:02,497;in my chambers,
839;00:52:02,498;00:52:04,747;so in the process
839;00:52:02,498;00:52:04,747;of building the sewers,
840;00:52:04,748;00:52:07,498;I threw in something
840;00:52:04,748;00:52:07,498;for myself.
841;00:52:09,540;00:52:11,539;It was a passage
841;00:52:09,540;00:52:11,539;that began
842;00:52:11,540;00:52:13,247;in an out of the way cove
842;00:52:11,540;00:52:13,247;by the sea
843;00:52:13,248;00:52:16,664;and ended beneath
843;00:52:13,248;00:52:16,664;one of the main guard towers.
844;00:52:16,665;00:52:19,873;No better place for low pursuits
844;00:52:16,665;00:52:19,873;than beneath the ground.
