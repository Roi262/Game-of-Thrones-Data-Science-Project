1;00:02:10,422;00:02:12,924;Gotta be ready before nightfall.
2;00:02:14,676;00:02:15,802;Now keep it moving.
3;00:02:20,974;00:02:24,393;Put a watch on the ridge
3;00:02:20,974;00:02:24,393;and the tree lines.
4;00:02:26,563;00:02:27,772;Boy.
5;00:02:28,941;00:02:30,358;Lovely boy.
6;00:02:30,943;00:02:32,652;What do you want?
7;00:02:32,736;00:02:34,320;A man has a thirst.
8;00:02:34,404;00:02:37,406;A man does not drink for a day and a night.
9;00:02:37,533;00:02:39,408;A boy could make a friend.
10;00:02:39,493;00:02:41,035;I have friends.
11;00:02:42,037;00:02:44,038;Give us beer before I skin you.
12;00:02:45,082;00:02:47,250;A man does not choose his companions.
13;00:02:47,334;00:02:49,293;These two, they have no courtesy.
14;00:02:49,378;00:02:51,420;A man must ask forgiveness.
15;00:02:54,550;00:02:56,342;You're called Arry?
16;00:02:59,054;00:03:01,597;This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar,
17;00:03:01,765;00:03:03,349;once of the Free City of Lorath...
18;00:03:03,433;00:03:06,644;Beer, you little shit. Get us beer!
19;00:03:07,938;00:03:09,522;You should have asked nicely.
20;00:03:09,606;00:03:10,606;Aah!
21;00:03:14,778;00:03:15,945;Come closer...
22;00:03:16,446;00:03:18,656;and I'll shove that stick up your bunghole
23;00:03:18,740;00:03:20,575;and fuck you bloody.
24;00:03:20,659;00:03:23,119;That boy has more courage than sense.
25;00:03:23,203;00:03:24,287;Come here!
26;00:03:24,538;00:03:25,955;Yoren said none of us were
26;00:03:24,538;00:03:25,955;to go near those three.
27;00:03:26,039;00:03:27,206;Come here!
28;00:03:27,291;00:03:28,499;They don't scare me.
29;00:03:28,750;00:03:30,626;Hmm? Then you're stupid.
30;00:03:30,711;00:03:32,545;They scare me.
31;00:03:36,967;00:03:39,760;What are gold cloaks
31;00:03:36,967;00:03:39,760;doing so far from King's Landing?
32;00:03:44,808;00:03:46,058;What are you doing?
33;00:03:46,143;00:03:47,476;They're looking for me.
34;00:03:48,312;00:03:49,687;You in command here?
35;00:03:51,189;00:03:53,190;You're a long way from home.
36;00:03:53,275;00:03:55,276;I asked you a question.
37;00:03:55,360;00:03:56,986;Aye, you did.
38;00:03:58,113;00:04:00,281;You asked without manners
39;00:04:01,116;00:04:02,742;and I chose not to answer.
40;00:04:03,201;00:04:04,535;I have a royal warrant
41;00:04:05,996;00:04:09,040;for one of these gutter rats
41;00:04:05,996;00:04:09,040;you're transporting.
42;00:04:12,669;00:04:14,211;Well, the thing is...
43;00:04:15,172;00:04:18,341;these gutter rats belong
43;00:04:15,172;00:04:18,341;to the Night's Watch now.
44;00:04:18,467;00:04:21,552;That puts them beyond the reach
44;00:04:18,467;00:04:21,552;of kings and queens.
45;00:04:21,637;00:04:23,179;Does it?
46;00:04:24,056;00:04:25,556;It's a funny thing,
47;00:04:25,641;00:04:27,683;people worry so much about their throats
48;00:04:27,768;00:04:30,186;that they forget about what's down low.
49;00:04:31,271;00:04:34,899;Now, I sharpened this blade before breakfast.
50;00:04:35,442;00:04:38,986;I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to.
51;00:04:39,738;00:04:43,616;Or... I could nick this artery in your leg.
52;00:04:43,700;00:04:45,701;And once it's nicked,
53;00:04:45,786;00:04:48,829;there's no one around here
53;00:04:45,786;00:04:48,829;who knows how to un-nick it.
54;00:04:49,998;00:04:52,041;We'll just keep that.
55;00:04:53,502;00:04:56,337;Good steel is always needed on the Wall.
56;00:04:57,297;00:04:59,131;Seems you have a choice,
57;00:04:59,216;00:05:03,469;you can die here at this crossroads
57;00:04:59,216;00:05:03,469;a long way from home,
58;00:05:03,553;00:05:06,263;or you can go back to your city
58;00:05:03,553;00:05:06,263;and tell your masters
59;00:05:06,348;00:05:08,766;you didn't find what you were looking for.
60;00:05:15,357;00:05:17,024;We're looking for a boy named Gendry.
61;00:05:17,109;00:05:19,402;He carries a bull's head helmet.
62;00:05:20,696;00:05:24,740;Anyone turning him over
62;00:05:20,696;00:05:24,740;will earn the King's reward.
63;00:05:24,825;00:05:27,410;We'll be back with more men
64;00:05:27,744;00:05:30,871;and I'll be taking your head home
64;00:05:27,744;00:05:30,871;along with that bastard boy.
65;00:06:07,117;00:06:08,075;My lord.
66;00:06:08,160;00:06:09,827;You make me wait a long time,
67;00:06:09,911;00:06:11,829;but your friend keeps me company.
68;00:06:12,873;00:06:14,832;We were just speaking of your bravery
69;00:06:15,042;00:06:17,626;in the victory against
69;00:06:15,042;00:06:17,626;the Stark auxiliary forces.
70;00:06:18,962;00:06:20,296;It was quite a battle.
71;00:06:21,631;00:06:24,675;I heard you suffered a terrible head wound.
72;00:06:25,302;00:06:28,304;The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
73;00:06:28,680;00:06:31,098;And I tell him the story of how we meet.
74;00:06:31,933;00:06:35,853;To find so lovely a creature
74;00:06:31,933;00:06:35,853;working in your father's kitchens...
75;00:06:36,605;00:06:38,272;It almost beggars belief.
76;00:06:39,316;00:06:40,816;Strange things do happen.
77;00:06:41,985;00:06:43,861;You should taste her fish pie.
78;00:06:44,112;00:06:46,447;I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.
79;00:06:46,531;00:06:49,658;How can you tell?
79;00:06:46,531;00:06:49,658;I can always tell.
80;00:06:50,160;00:06:53,788;Men like Lord Varys and I can't let
80;00:06:50,160;00:06:53,788;our disadvantages get the best of us.
81;00:06:53,872;00:06:55,748;We'll make a fisherman of him yet.
82;00:06:56,792;00:07:01,003;I am glad your new friend
82;00:06:56,792;00:07:01,003;was able to accompany you to the capital.
83;00:07:01,922;00:07:04,882;Friends are such an important part of life.
84;00:07:05,926;00:07:08,594;Unfortunate that your father
84;00:07:05,926;00:07:08,594;didn't want her to come.
85;00:07:09,429;00:07:11,097;But rest easy, my lord.
86;00:07:11,932;00:07:15,518;I am very good at keeping secrets
86;00:07:11,932;00:07:15,518;for my good friends.
87;00:07:16,353;00:07:18,104;Your discretion is legendary...
88;00:07:18,396;00:07:20,189;Where your friends are concerned.
89;00:07:20,273;00:07:24,860;How unspeakable of me to go on and on
89;00:07:20,273;00:07:24,860;when all you want to do is rest.
90;00:07:24,986;00:07:26,070;I will leave you.
91;00:07:28,615;00:07:30,783;Welcome to King's Landing, my dear.
92;00:07:30,867;00:07:33,744;This city is made brighter by your presence.
93;00:07:34,121;00:07:35,955;We have a council meeting, my lord.
94;00:07:39,668;00:07:41,794;I don't like threats.
95;00:07:42,170;00:07:43,295;Who threatened you?
96;00:07:43,380;00:07:46,340;I'm not Ned Stark.
96;00:07:43,380;00:07:46,340;I understand the way this game is played.
97;00:07:46,424;00:07:48,092;Ned Stark was a man of honor.
98;00:07:48,176;00:07:49,385;And I am not.
99;00:07:49,469;00:07:52,471;Threaten me again
99;00:07:49,469;00:07:52,471;and I'll have you thrown into the sea.
100;00:07:56,393;00:07:58,602;You might be disappointed in the results.
101;00:07:59,479;00:08:01,355;Storms come and go,
102;00:08:01,731;00:08:03,691;the big fish eat the little fish,
103;00:08:03,775;00:08:06,443;and I keep on paddling.
104;00:08:08,238;00:08:09,238;Come, my lord.
105;00:08:09,990;00:08:12,283;We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.
106;00:08:17,747;00:08:19,582;CERSEl: From this time until the end of time,
107;00:08:19,666;00:08:21,417;we are not part of your realm,
108;00:08:21,501;00:08:24,712;but a free and independent
108;00:08:21,501;00:08:24,712;Kingdom of the North.
109;00:08:29,092;00:08:31,468;He has more spirit than his father,
109;00:08:29,092;00:08:31,468;I'll give him that.
110;00:08:31,553;00:08:34,305;You've perfected the art of tearing up papers.
111;00:08:35,223;00:08:37,349;We can give him his father's bones back,
111;00:08:35,223;00:08:37,349;at least,
112;00:08:37,434;00:08:39,185;as a gesture of good faith.
113;00:08:39,436;00:08:41,353;You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?
114;00:08:42,439;00:08:43,856;I will, Your Grace.
115;00:08:45,442;00:08:47,985;Did you see my brother
115;00:08:45,442;00:08:47,985;when you were the Starks' guest?
116;00:08:48,069;00:08:49,361;I did.
117;00:08:49,446;00:08:51,739;They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace.
118;00:08:53,033;00:08:54,992;If you speak with him,
119;00:08:55,952;00:08:57,953;tell him he's not been forgotten.
120;00:08:58,788;00:09:00,956;I will, Your Grace.
120;00:08:58,788;00:09:00,956;Safe travels, cousin.
121;00:09:05,962;00:09:07,796;You have a deft hand with diplomacy.
122;00:09:08,006;00:09:09,590;If that's everything...
123;00:09:09,966;00:09:14,053;A raven flew in this morning
123;00:09:09,966;00:09:14,053;from Castle Black.
124;00:09:14,804;00:09:16,347;Trouble with the wildlings.
125;00:09:16,973;00:09:18,933;That's why they're called wildlings.
126;00:09:19,142;00:09:21,310;Somewhat less wild these days.
127;00:09:21,728;00:09:23,938;Seems they've stopped killing each other
128;00:09:24,022;00:09:26,732;and started following
128;00:09:24,022;00:09:26,732;this king-beyond-the-Wall.
129;00:09:27,025;00:09:29,235;Another king? How many is that now?
130;00:09:29,319;00:09:31,403;Five? I've lost count.
131;00:09:31,488;00:09:35,074;The Lord Commander asks
131;00:09:31,488;00:09:35,074;that we send more men to man the Wall.
132;00:09:35,158;00:09:38,619;Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war.
132;00:09:35,158;00:09:38,619;We have no men to spare.
133;00:09:38,745;00:09:42,915;The cold winds are rising
133;00:09:38,745;00:09:42,915;and the dead rise with them.
134;00:09:43,625;00:09:46,669;The northerners are a superstitious people.
135;00:09:47,087;00:09:48,837;According to the Commander,
136;00:09:48,922;00:09:51,090;one of these dead men
136;00:09:48,922;00:09:51,090;attacked him in his chambers.
137;00:09:51,174;00:09:52,675;Mormont doesn't lie.
138;00:09:53,802;00:09:55,761;How do you kill a dead man?
139;00:09:56,972;00:09:58,514;Apparently you burn him.
140;00:10:00,016;00:10:04,937;One trip to the Wall and you come back
140;00:10:00,016;00:10:04,937;believing in grumpkins and snarks.
141;00:10:06,106;00:10:07,690;I don't know what I believe,
142;00:10:08,858;00:10:10,567;but here's a fact for you:
143;00:10:10,777;00:10:12,486;the Night's Watch is the only thing
144;00:10:12,570;00:10:15,155;that separates us from
144;00:10:12,570;00:10:15,155;what lies beyond the Wall.
145;00:10:15,240;00:10:19,702;I have every confidence that the brave men
145;00:10:15,240;00:10:19,702;of the Night's Watch will protect us all.
146;00:10:22,247;00:10:25,124;And I said,
146;00:10:22,247;00:10:25,124;If the gods wanted us to have dignity,
147;00:10:25,208;00:10:27,501;they wouldn't make us fart when we died.
148;00:10:29,754;00:10:31,255;We fart when we die?
149;00:10:32,382;00:10:33,757;My blessed mother,
150;00:10:33,842;00:10:36,385;I was holding her hand
150;00:10:33,842;00:10:36,385;when she left this world.
151;00:10:36,720;00:10:40,222;She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.
152;00:10:49,357;00:10:52,609;Seems a bit greedy for one man
152;00:10:49,357;00:10:52,609;to have so many wives.
153;00:10:52,694;00:10:55,112;Wouldn't two or three be enough for him?
154;00:10:55,196;00:10:57,364;We were having a serious discussion.
155;00:10:59,659;00:11:00,993;Would you look at that?
156;00:11:03,079;00:11:05,247;Nothing like the sight
156;00:11:03,079;00:11:05,247;of a woman walking away.
157;00:11:05,874;00:11:07,875;I prefer watching them come towards me.
158;00:11:08,918;00:11:10,294;I'm sure that's nice, too.
159;00:11:10,378;00:11:15,966;Yeah, well, there was a milkmaid named Violet
159;00:11:10,378;00:11:15,966;on the next farm over from where I grew up.
160;00:11:16,051;00:11:19,094;We were wrestling together
160;00:11:16,051;00:11:19,094;from the time we were six years old.
161;00:11:20,180;00:11:24,058;And then we got older and the wrestling...
162;00:11:25,685;00:11:27,061;changed.
163;00:11:27,604;00:11:28,771;You were with her?
164;00:11:29,939;00:11:31,148;How many times?
165;00:11:31,941;00:11:33,609;Well, as many times as I could.
166;00:11:37,364;00:11:39,114;I wish I grew up on a farm.
167;00:11:39,616;00:11:43,327;We need more potatoes.
167;00:11:39,616;00:11:43,327;Get another sack from the sledge.
168;00:11:46,915;00:11:49,041;Get the turnips, too.
169;00:12:00,553;00:12:03,389;No. Ghost, no.
170;00:12:03,973;00:12:05,182;No!
171;00:12:07,060;00:12:08,644;Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo!
172;00:12:13,358;00:12:14,817;You all right?
173;00:12:15,443;00:12:18,028;Did he frighten you?
173;00:12:15,443;00:12:18,028;You shouldn't touch me.
174;00:12:18,571;00:12:19,780;Oh.
175;00:12:19,864;00:12:21,615;Oh, right.
176;00:12:21,699;00:12:23,242;I'm sorry.
177;00:12:23,326;00:12:26,203;I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt.
178;00:12:32,710;00:12:34,545;You're very brave.
179;00:12:44,514;00:12:46,515;What are you doing?
180;00:12:46,850;00:12:48,475;This is Gilly.
181;00:12:48,560;00:12:50,602;She's one of Craster's daughters.
182;00:12:51,688;00:12:53,397;Hello, Gilly. What are you doing?
183;00:12:53,481;00:12:54,898;Sam said you could help.
184;00:12:55,024;00:12:56,608;I'm sorry, but Sam knows
184;00:12:55,024;00:12:56,608;we're not supposed...
185;00:12:56,693;00:12:58,068;She's pregnant.
186;00:13:05,285;00:13:07,619;We have to take her with us when we leave.
187;00:13:07,704;00:13:09,455;What?
188;00:13:09,539;00:13:11,457;What would that...
188;00:13:09,539;00:13:11,457;I know it sounds a bit mad.
189;00:13:11,541;00:13:13,125;No, it doesn't sound a bit mad,
189;00:13:11,541;00:13:13,125;it's impossible.
190;00:13:13,209;00:13:16,128;The Lord Commander ordered us to...
190;00:13:13,209;00:13:16,128;We are sworn to protect.
191;00:13:16,212;00:13:18,005;Sam, we can't take...
191;00:13:16,212;00:13:18,005;Please, sir, please.
192;00:13:18,089;00:13:19,965;I can still run if I have to.
193;00:13:20,049;00:13:22,384;It's just not possible.
193;00:13:20,049;00:13:22,384;I'm going to have a baby.
194;00:13:22,469;00:13:23,552;If it's a boy...
195;00:13:25,013;00:13:26,805;If it's a boy, what?
196;00:13:32,061;00:13:36,356;You want us to risk our lives for you
196;00:13:32,061;00:13:36,356;and you won't even tell us why?
197;00:13:42,113;00:13:45,157;Why'd you do that?
197;00:13:42,113;00:13:45,157;Do what? Ask her a question?
198;00:13:45,241;00:13:47,034;You were cruel.
198;00:13:45,241;00:13:47,034;Cruel?
199;00:13:47,118;00:13:49,036;Sam, are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
200;00:13:49,120;00:13:51,330;I didn't touch her.
200;00:13:49,120;00:13:51,330;No, you just want to steal her.
201;00:13:51,414;00:13:53,040;What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
202;00:13:53,124;00:13:57,294;I can't steal her. She's a person, not a goat.
203;00:14:02,425;00:14:05,844;We're heading
203;00:14:02,425;00:14:05,844;deeper and deeper into wildling territory.
204;00:14:05,929;00:14:08,639;We can't take a girl with us.
204;00:14:05,929;00:14:08,639;Mormont wouldn't have it.
205;00:14:08,723;00:14:11,600;And even if he would,
205;00:14:08,723;00:14:11,600;what would we do with her?
206;00:14:11,684;00:14:13,477;Who's going to deliver a baby, you?
207;00:14:14,729;00:14:15,729;I could try.
208;00:14:16,773;00:14:18,732;What? I've read about it.
209;00:14:20,276;00:14:21,360;A bit.
210;00:14:23,446;00:14:24,780;I'm sorry, Sam.
211;00:14:26,157;00:14:27,324;We can't help her.
212;00:15:24,132;00:15:25,465;Khaleesi.
213;00:16:11,220;00:16:13,847;You don't need to see this.
213;00:16:11,220;00:16:13,847;He is blood of my blood.
214;00:16:17,393;00:16:20,354;Who did this?
214;00:16:17,393;00:16:20,354;Khal Pono, perhaps.
215;00:16:20,438;00:16:22,689;Khal Jhaqo.
216;00:16:22,774;00:16:25,942;They don't like the idea of a woman
216;00:16:22,774;00:16:25,942;leading a khalasar.
217;00:16:26,027;00:16:28,987;They will like it far less
217;00:16:26,027;00:16:28,987;when I am done with them.
218;00:16:40,375;00:16:42,876;They killed his soul!
219;00:16:44,837;00:16:47,130;Shh. They cannot kill his soul.
220;00:16:47,882;00:16:49,132;They did!
221;00:16:49,592;00:16:51,593;They butchered him like an animal.
222;00:16:52,720;00:16:55,430;They did not burn his body.
223;00:16:55,723;00:17:00,435;He can neverjoin his ancestors
223;00:16:55,723;00:17:00,435;in the night lands.
224;00:17:01,521;00:17:04,606;Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.
225;00:17:11,572;00:17:12,989;And I promise you,
226;00:17:13,741;00:17:15,992;Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight.
227;00:18:01,581;00:18:03,248;Is it as you remember, my lord?
228;00:18:03,875;00:18:05,417;It looks smaller.
229;00:18:05,501;00:18:07,335;Everything looks bigger when you're a child.
230;00:18:07,420;00:18:11,256;I remember my father's cabin
230;00:18:07,420;00:18:11,256;felt like a palace when I was little.
231;00:18:11,549;00:18:14,593;Now look at it.
232;00:18:14,677;00:18:16,928;They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
233;00:18:17,013;00:18:18,680;Who will?
234;00:18:18,765;00:18:20,599;Anyone who matters.
235;00:18:20,683;00:18:22,726;This is a big day for them.
236;00:18:22,810;00:18:26,271;They haven't had much to get
236;00:18:22,810;00:18:26,271;excited about since I left.
237;00:18:26,355;00:18:28,440;It's a hard place, the Iron Islands.
238;00:18:28,524;00:18:29,983;Always has been.
239;00:18:30,067;00:18:32,277;It's cold and it's wet.
240;00:18:32,653;00:18:34,029;Oh, I love the cold and wet.
241;00:18:34,113;00:18:36,531;They say hard places breed hard men.
242;00:18:38,367;00:18:40,285;And hard men rule the world.
243;00:18:43,080;00:18:45,332;Then you'll be king before long.
244;00:18:47,668;00:18:50,462;Try smiling with your lips closed.
245;00:18:51,714;00:18:52,714;Better.
246;00:18:55,760;00:18:58,637;My father doesn't trust you Iron Islanders.
247;00:18:58,721;00:19:00,639;I don't blame him.
248;00:19:00,723;00:19:03,725;He says that you're all reavers and rapers
249;00:19:03,810;00:19:05,644;and that no matter
249;00:19:03,810;00:19:05,644;how many women you have,
250;00:19:05,728;00:19:07,813;you'll never be sat...
251;00:19:07,897;00:19:09,856;Quit talking about your father.
252;00:19:11,025;00:19:13,151;But he's right about us.
253;00:19:13,986;00:19:17,572;Our wives from the Iron Islands,
253;00:19:13,986;00:19:17,572;they're for breeding.
254;00:19:17,657;00:19:19,866;That's not enough for us.
255;00:19:19,951;00:19:23,995;That's why we take salt wives,
255;00:19:19,951;00:19:23,995;the women we capture.
256;00:19:24,080;00:19:25,497;Capture me.
257;00:19:25,581;00:19:27,666;Take me with you when you go ashore.
258;00:19:27,750;00:19:31,837;Make me your salt wife.
258;00:19:27,750;00:19:31,837;Your place is on this ship.
259;00:19:31,921;00:19:33,964;Not after you leave.
260;00:19:34,048;00:19:37,843;Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore.
261;00:19:39,095;00:19:41,429;I haven't paid you.
262;00:19:53,943;00:19:55,026;Oh, yeah.
263;00:20:05,538;00:20:08,206;I paid good money...
264;00:20:17,967;00:20:20,093;I'm not going to stand for this.
265;00:20:20,177;00:20:21,887;I barely touched her.
266;00:20:21,971;00:20:24,472;Now, you charge twice as much
266;00:20:21,971;00:20:24,472;as every other brothel
267;00:20:24,557;00:20:25,932;and this is what I get, crying.
268;00:20:26,017;00:20:28,351;One moment, my friend. A moment.
269;00:20:37,862;00:20:39,988;Please accept my sincerest apologies.
270;00:20:40,072;00:20:42,490;Aremca will take good care of you.
271;00:21:12,396;00:21:14,105;I'm sorry, my lord.
272;00:21:18,194;00:21:19,486;Did he hurt you?
273;00:21:21,530;00:21:22,530;No, my lord.
274;00:21:25,493;00:21:26,576;It's Mhaegen.
275;00:21:27,161;00:21:28,203;Who?
276;00:21:30,206;00:21:31,706;She works for you.
277;00:21:33,250;00:21:34,376;She's the one...
278;00:21:35,044;00:21:36,795;The gold cloaks,
279;00:21:36,879;00:21:39,547;they killed her baby.
279;00:21:36,879;00:21:39,547;Ah, yes.
280;00:21:39,632;00:21:40,966;That was...
281;00:21:41,884;00:21:43,301;poorly handled.
282;00:21:45,638;00:21:49,224;Sometimes those with the most power
282;00:21:45,638;00:21:49,224;have the least grace.
283;00:21:51,560;00:21:53,228;I can't stop thinking about it.
284;00:21:54,188;00:21:55,730;I can't sleep.
285;00:21:57,984;00:21:59,567;Her poor little baby.
286;00:22:00,820;00:22:02,904;You know, you remind me of another girl,
287;00:22:04,156;00:22:07,742;a lovely thing I once acquired
287;00:22:04,156;00:22:07,742;from a Lysene pleasure house.
288;00:22:09,328;00:22:11,871;Beautiful, like yourself,
289;00:22:11,956;00:22:15,333;and intelligent, like yourself.
290;00:22:16,293;00:22:17,836;But she wasn't happy.
291;00:22:19,922;00:22:22,132;She cried often.
292;00:22:22,967;00:22:24,467;I asked her why,
293;00:22:26,595;00:22:29,514;but we didn't have the kind of rapport
293;00:22:26,595;00:22:29,514;that you and I have.
294;00:22:33,227;00:22:35,103;Yes, it was quite sad.
295;00:22:37,440;00:22:40,608;Girls from the Lysene pleasure houses
295;00:22:37,440;00:22:40,608;are expensive,
296;00:22:40,693;00:22:42,277;extremely expensive.
297;00:22:42,987;00:22:45,697;And this one wasn't making me any money.
298;00:22:50,327;00:22:52,495;I hate bad investments.
299;00:22:53,372;00:22:54,873;Really, I do.
300;00:22:56,917;00:22:58,126;They haunt me.
301;00:23:02,256;00:23:04,257;I had no idea how to make her happy,
302;00:23:05,676;00:23:08,261;no idea how to mitigate my losses.
303;00:23:10,222;00:23:14,059;A very wealthy patron,
303;00:23:10,222;00:23:14,059;he offered me a tremendous amount of money
304;00:23:14,143;00:23:15,977;to let him transform
305;00:23:16,062;00:23:19,147;this lovely, sad girl.
306;00:23:19,815;00:23:21,649;To use her in ways
307;00:23:22,902;00:23:24,861;that would never occur to most men.
308;00:23:27,073;00:23:29,074;But you know what occurs to most men.
309;00:23:33,412;00:23:36,164;I would not say he succeeded
309;00:23:33,412;00:23:36,164;in making her happy,
310;00:23:38,209;00:23:41,836;but my losses were definitely mitigated.
311;00:23:50,513;00:23:52,680;Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child.
312;00:23:54,475;00:23:55,809;I'll see you tomorrow.
313;00:23:56,852;00:23:58,186;And you'll be happy?
314;00:24:02,441;00:24:03,858;That makes me happy.
315;00:24:16,831;00:24:17,872;More wine?
316;00:24:19,083;00:24:21,126;Damn it, boy!
316;00:24:19,083;00:24:21,126;Apologies, my lord.
317;00:24:21,210;00:24:24,420;Leave us, Podrick.
317;00:24:21,210;00:24:24,420;I believe we know how to pour our own wine.
318;00:24:25,965;00:24:27,632;That's your new squire?
319;00:24:27,716;00:24:29,676;I could've found you a proper lad.
320;00:24:29,760;00:24:32,762;Myself, I prefer the improper ones.
321;00:24:33,514;00:24:35,431;That's a good red. Dornish?
322;00:24:35,516;00:24:36,933;You know your wines, my lord.
323;00:24:37,017;00:24:38,560;That I do.
324;00:24:39,562;00:24:41,187;A fine dinner, my lord.
325;00:24:41,272;00:24:42,897;Call me Tyrion, please.
326;00:24:43,357;00:24:46,776;I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners,
326;00:24:43,357;00:24:46,776;now that you're a lord.
327;00:24:46,861;00:24:48,695;Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.
328;00:24:48,821;00:24:51,322;Wars have been started for less.
329;00:24:52,741;00:24:55,451;I heard there was some trouble
329;00:24:52,741;00:24:55,451;in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
330;00:24:55,536;00:24:56,578;Mmm.
331;00:24:57,079;00:24:58,037;Nasty business.
332;00:24:58,122;00:24:59,956;Had to be done.
332;00:24:58,122;00:24:59,956;Yes, of course.
333;00:25:00,040;00:25:01,875;The City Watch must keep the peace.
334;00:25:02,251;00:25:05,879;Only, I hadn't realized
334;00:25:02,251;00:25:05,879;peace depended on killing babies.
335;00:25:07,256;00:25:09,591;Orders are orders.
335;00:25:07,256;00:25:09,591;Quite right.
336;00:25:09,758;00:25:11,759;Especially the Queen's orders.
337;00:25:11,969;00:25:13,553;I never said they were the Queen's orders.
338;00:25:13,637;00:25:17,390;No, but who else would want
338;00:25:13,637;00:25:17,390;to murder King Robert's bastards?
339;00:25:18,184;00:25:19,767;She's always been a jealous woman.
340;00:25:19,852;00:25:21,519;You know your sister better than I do.
341;00:25:21,604;00:25:23,897;You've heard the awful rumors
341;00:25:21,604;00:25:23,897;about my brother and sister?
342;00:25:23,981;00:25:25,607;I don't listen to filth.
343;00:25:25,691;00:25:28,484;That's good of you, but you have heard them.
344;00:25:29,028;00:25:31,863;I suppose people who do believe that filth
344;00:25:29,028;00:25:31,863;consider Robert's bastards
345;00:25:31,947;00:25:34,449;to be better claimants to the throne
345;00:25:31,947;00:25:34,449;than Cersei's children.
346;00:25:34,533;00:25:36,492;Joffrey is my king.
346;00:25:34,533;00:25:36,492;The rest doesn't interest me.
347;00:25:36,619;00:25:38,620;I appreciate your loyalty.
348;00:25:40,414;00:25:44,334;Tell me, when your men
348;00:25:40,414;00:25:44,334;slaughtered Ned Stark's men
349;00:25:44,418;00:25:47,337;in the throne room, did you give the order?
350;00:25:48,714;00:25:49,797;I did.
351;00:25:50,299;00:25:52,050;And I would again.
352;00:25:52,134;00:25:53,927;The man was a traitor.
353;00:25:54,011;00:25:55,887;He tried to buy my loyalty.
354;00:25:55,971;00:25:57,347;The fool.
355;00:25:58,098;00:26:00,225;He had no idea you were already bought.
356;00:26:00,768;00:26:02,060;Are you drunk?
357;00:26:02,561;00:26:04,771;I'll not have my honor questioned by an imp!
358;00:26:05,314;00:26:08,149;I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos.
359;00:26:08,859;00:26:10,568;I'm denying its existence.
360;00:26:10,653;00:26:13,738;If you think I'll stand here
360;00:26:10,653;00:26:13,738;and take this from you, dwarf...
361;00:26:13,822;00:26:16,616;Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp.
362;00:26:16,700;00:26:19,202;And, yes, you will stand here
362;00:26:16,700;00:26:19,202;and take it from me,
363;00:26:19,286;00:26:21,704;unless you'd like to take it
363;00:26:19,286;00:26:21,704;from my friend here.
364;00:26:22,581;00:26:24,457;I intend to serve as Hand of the King
365;00:26:24,541;00:26:26,084;until my father returns from the war.
366;00:26:26,168;00:26:28,378;And seeing as you betrayed
366;00:26:26,168;00:26:28,378;the last Hand of the King,
367;00:26:28,462;00:26:31,256;well, I just wouldn't feel safe
367;00:26:28,462;00:26:31,256;with you lurking about.
368;00:26:31,465;00:26:32,882;What are you...
369;00:26:32,967;00:26:34,926;My friends at court will not allow this!
370;00:26:35,010;00:26:37,011;The Queen herself has granted...
370;00:26:35,010;00:26:37,011;The Queen Regent.
371;00:26:37,096;00:26:39,639;And you're a fool to believe she is your friend.
372;00:26:40,307;00:26:41,975;We shall hear what Joffrey
372;00:26:40,307;00:26:41,975;has to say about this.
373;00:26:42,059;00:26:43,184;No, we shan't.
374;00:26:50,734;00:26:54,112;There's a ship leaving
374;00:26:50,734;00:26:54,112;for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea tonight.
375;00:26:54,196;00:26:57,657;From there, I'm afraid,
375;00:26:54,196;00:26:57,657;it's rather a long walk to Castle Black.
376;00:26:57,741;00:26:59,200;I hope you enjoy the Wall.
377;00:26:59,952;00:27:02,328;I found it surprisingly beautiful...
378;00:27:02,871;00:27:06,291;in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable
378;00:27:02,871;00:27:06,291;sort of way.
379;00:27:06,792;00:27:08,209;The lads will escort you.
380;00:27:08,294;00:27:10,461;The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.
381;00:27:10,546;00:27:12,213;These men are under my command!
382;00:27:12,840;00:27:14,924;I command you to arrest this cutthroat.
383;00:27:15,009;00:27:16,634;His name is Bronn,
384;00:27:16,719;00:27:19,095;and he is the new commander
384;00:27:16,719;00:27:19,095;of the City Watch.
385;00:27:19,471;00:27:20,471;Boys.
386;00:27:21,765;00:27:25,226;I have friends at court,
387;00:27:25,311;00:27:27,061;powerful friends!
388;00:27:27,980;00:27:30,398;The king himself made me a lord!
389;00:27:35,237;00:27:37,447;To the new commander.
390;00:27:43,579;00:27:47,540;If I told you to murder an infant girl, say,
391;00:27:47,624;00:27:49,625;still at her mother's breast,
392;00:27:50,961;00:27:52,795;would you do it without question?
393;00:27:55,215;00:27:57,425;Without question? No.
394;00:27:58,260;00:27:59,427;I'd ask, How much?
395;00:28:17,738;00:28:19,947;If they come back, I say we yield.
396;00:28:20,032;00:28:21,449;Gendry's the one they want.
397;00:28:21,533;00:28:23,284;Don't want to get caught
397;00:28:21,533;00:28:23,284;in the middle of a battle.
398;00:28:23,369;00:28:25,036;I ain't afraid of no battles.
399;00:28:25,120;00:28:27,747;If you got within a mile of a battle,
399;00:28:25,120;00:28:27,747;you'd fill your pants.
400;00:28:27,831;00:28:29,290;I've seen lots of battles.
401;00:28:29,375;00:28:31,042;I saw...
401;00:28:29,375;00:28:31,042;Liar.
402;00:28:31,126;00:28:33,252;I saw a man kill another man
403;00:28:33,337;00:28:35,755;just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom.
404;00:28:35,839;00:28:38,091;Stabbed him right in the neck.
405;00:28:38,175;00:28:40,468;Two men fighting isn't a battle.
406;00:28:41,011;00:28:43,638;They had armor on.
406;00:28:41,011;00:28:43,638;So?
407;00:28:44,181;00:28:46,349;So, if they've got armor on, it's a battle.
408;00:28:46,433;00:28:47,809;No, it isn't.
409;00:28:48,310;00:28:51,020;What does a dyer's apprentice
409;00:28:48,310;00:28:51,020;know about battles anyway?
410;00:28:51,105;00:28:53,147;Gendry's an armorer's apprentice.
411;00:28:53,232;00:28:56,150;Hot Pie, tell Gendry
411;00:28:53,232;00:28:56,150;what makes a fight into a battle.
412;00:28:57,986;00:29:00,488;It's when they've got armor on.
413;00:29:00,572;00:29:02,240;Who told you that?
414;00:29:03,492;00:29:04,784;A knight.
415;00:29:05,619;00:29:07,286;How'd you know he was a knight?
416;00:29:08,831;00:29:11,874;Well, it was 'cause he'd got armor on.
417;00:29:11,959;00:29:14,001;You don't have to be a knight to have armor.
418;00:29:14,086;00:29:15,503;Any idiot can buy armor.
419;00:29:16,004;00:29:17,630;How do you know?
420;00:29:17,923;00:29:19,382;'Cause I sold armor.
421;00:29:32,729;00:29:34,605;What do the gold cloaks want with you?
422;00:29:34,690;00:29:36,607;No idea.
422;00:29:34,690;00:29:36,607;You're a liar.
423;00:29:36,692;00:29:39,360;You know, you shouldn't
423;00:29:36,692;00:29:39,360;insult people that are bigger than you.
424;00:29:39,445;00:29:42,029;Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone.
425;00:29:42,114;00:29:44,115;I don't care what any of them want.
426;00:29:44,199;00:29:46,159;No good's ever come of their questions.
427;00:29:46,243;00:29:48,244;No good's ever come?
428;00:29:48,704;00:29:50,455;Who asked questions before?
429;00:29:50,539;00:29:53,666;How can someone so small
429;00:29:50,539;00:29:53,666;be such a huge pain in my arse?
430;00:29:53,750;00:29:55,001;Who asked questions?
431;00:29:57,963;00:29:59,380;The Hand of the King.
432;00:29:59,882;00:30:01,674;Hands of the King.
433;00:30:02,342;00:30:04,927;Lord Arryn came first
433;00:30:02,342;00:30:04,927;a few weeks before he died,
434;00:30:05,012;00:30:08,556;and then Lord Stark came
434;00:30:05,012;00:30:08,556;a few weeks before he died.
435;00:30:09,475;00:30:11,350;Lord Stark?
436;00:30:11,435;00:30:14,896;See? Asking me questions is bad luck.
437;00:30:16,732;00:30:18,733;You'll probably be dead soon.
438;00:30:19,693;00:30:22,945;What did they ask about?
438;00:30:19,693;00:30:22,945;My mum.
439;00:30:23,030;00:30:25,615;Who's your mum?
439;00:30:23,030;00:30:25,615;Just my mum,
440;00:30:25,699;00:30:27,617;worked in a tavern, died when I was little.
441;00:30:27,701;00:30:29,327;And who was your father?
442;00:30:29,411;00:30:32,538;Could've been one of those
442;00:30:29,411;00:30:32,538;gold-hatted bastards, for all I know.
443;00:30:32,623;00:30:34,707;What about you anyway?
444;00:30:34,791;00:30:36,918;You thought they were after you.
445;00:30:37,920;00:30:39,837;Why?
446;00:30:39,922;00:30:42,757;Did you kill someone
446;00:30:39,922;00:30:42,757;or is it just because you're a girl?
447;00:30:43,217;00:30:45,593;I'm not a girl.
447;00:30:43,217;00:30:45,593;Yes, you are.
448;00:30:45,802;00:30:47,345;Do you think I'm as stupid
448;00:30:45,802;00:30:47,345;as the rest of them?
449;00:30:47,429;00:30:48,471;Stupider.
450;00:30:48,555;00:30:50,473;The Night's Watch doesn't take girls,
450;00:30:48,555;00:30:50,473;everyone knows that.
451;00:30:50,557;00:30:53,017;Yeah, that's true, but you're still a girl.
451;00:30:50,557;00:30:53,017;I am not!
452;00:30:53,101;00:30:55,686;Yeah? Well, pull your cock out
452;00:30:53,101;00:30:55,686;and take a piss, then.
453;00:30:56,772;00:30:58,356;I don't need to take a piss.
454;00:31:04,780;00:31:06,781;Lommy and Hot Pie can't know.
455;00:31:06,865;00:31:08,282;No one can know.
456;00:31:08,367;00:31:11,953;Well, they won't. Not from me.
457;00:31:14,915;00:31:16,457;My name's not Arry.
458;00:31:17,459;00:31:20,044;It's Arya, of House Stark.
459;00:31:22,172;00:31:24,298;Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
460;00:31:25,592;00:31:28,761;He was your father, the Hand, the traitor.
461;00:31:28,845;00:31:30,346;He was never a traitor.
462;00:31:30,806;00:31:32,348;Joffrey is a liar.
463;00:31:33,433;00:31:35,226;So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.
464;00:31:35,310;00:31:37,186;No. I mean, yes.
465;00:31:37,271;00:31:38,813;My mother was a lady and my sister...
466;00:31:38,897;00:31:42,441;Yeah, but you were a lord's daughter,
466;00:31:38,897;00:31:42,441;and you lived in a castle and you...
467;00:31:42,651;00:31:45,236;Look, all that about cocks,
467;00:31:42,651;00:31:45,236;I should never have said...
468;00:31:45,320;00:31:47,863;And I've been pissing
468;00:31:45,320;00:31:47,863;in front of you and everything.
469;00:31:48,991;00:31:50,366;I should be calling you my lady.
470;00:31:50,450;00:31:53,244;Do not call me my lady.
470;00:31:50,450;00:31:53,244;As my lady commands.
471;00:31:53,328;00:31:55,204;Well, that was unladylike.
472;00:31:55,289;00:31:56,789;Oh!
473;00:32:24,526;00:32:26,277;What's she carrying?
474;00:32:27,654;00:32:29,238;Myrish oranges,
475;00:32:29,698;00:32:30,990;wine from the Arbor...
476;00:32:32,326;00:32:34,869;and the heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands.
477;00:32:38,373;00:32:41,292;The only living son of Balon Greyjoy.
478;00:32:45,047;00:32:46,047;Me.
479;00:32:47,924;00:32:49,467;I don't like wine.
480;00:32:50,218;00:32:51,510;Woman's drink.
481;00:32:55,057;00:32:56,432;I need to get to Pyke.
482;00:33:06,401;00:33:08,194;I'll find you a horse.
483;00:33:19,039;00:33:22,291;I'm heading that way. I can take you there.
484;00:33:23,502;00:33:24,752;I bet you can.
485;00:33:25,087;00:33:26,921;Have you been at sea long?
486;00:33:27,172;00:33:29,548;Or were there just no women
486;00:33:27,172;00:33:29,548;where you came from?
487;00:33:29,633;00:33:31,801;None like you.
487;00:33:29,633;00:33:31,801;You don't know what I'm like.
488;00:33:32,552;00:33:34,512;Maybe you don't know what you're like.
489;00:33:34,596;00:33:36,722;Maybe you need someone to teach you.
490;00:33:38,183;00:33:39,684;Do you know who I am?
491;00:33:39,768;00:33:43,062;You think I offer free rides
491;00:33:39,768;00:33:43,062;to every man in jewelry,
492;00:33:44,189;00:33:45,606;Lord Greyjoy?
493;00:33:48,402;00:33:50,986;Have my things sent up to the castle.
494;00:34:08,171;00:34:09,588;You should give me the reins.
495;00:34:09,673;00:34:11,298;I'm a better rider than you.
496;00:34:11,800;00:34:13,300;I've been on horseback
496;00:34:11,800;00:34:13,300;for the past nine years.
497;00:34:13,468;00:34:14,885;Nine years?
498;00:34:15,011;00:34:17,763;Do you still know your way around a ship?
499;00:34:17,848;00:34:19,807;Have these hands ever touched a rope?
500;00:34:20,016;00:34:22,309;Don't you worry about my hands.
501;00:34:24,062;00:34:26,355;The sea is in my blood.
502;00:34:26,440;00:34:29,442;Your blood will be in the sea
502;00:34:26,440;00:34:29,442;if I don't watch where I'm going.
503;00:34:29,526;00:34:31,986;I have a proposal for my father,
504;00:34:32,821;00:34:35,406;one that will make him king again,
505;00:34:35,490;00:34:37,116;and me after him.
506;00:34:39,578;00:34:42,329;You may get to stay
506;00:34:39,578;00:34:42,329;in a castle tonight if you're lucky.
507;00:34:42,831;00:34:44,540;Is that an offer from my future king?
508;00:34:44,624;00:34:46,751;An order from your future king.
509;00:34:49,337;00:34:51,964;You can tell your grandchildren
509;00:34:49,337;00:34:51,964;about this night.
510;00:34:52,132;00:34:55,426;I don't imagine it will be
510;00:34:52,132;00:34:55,426;a story fit for children.
511;00:35:08,315;00:35:09,440;Father.
512;00:35:10,901;00:35:12,526;Nine years, is it?
513;00:35:13,904;00:35:15,780;They took a frightened boy.
514;00:35:16,490;00:35:18,199;What have they given back?
515;00:35:20,035;00:35:21,160;A man.
516;00:35:22,162;00:35:24,371;Your blood and your heir.
516;00:35:22,162;00:35:24,371;We shall see.
517;00:35:26,500;00:35:28,793;Stark had you longer than I did.
518;00:35:29,586;00:35:31,587;Lord Stark is gone.
519;00:35:33,423;00:35:35,883;And how do you feel about that?
520;00:35:39,805;00:35:41,055;What's done is done.
521;00:35:42,390;00:35:44,141;I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.
522;00:35:44,226;00:35:45,726;Who gave you those clothes?
523;00:35:47,145;00:35:50,731;Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
523;00:35:47,145;00:35:50,731;to make you his daughter?
524;00:35:51,566;00:35:53,651;If my clothes offend you, I will change them.
525;00:35:53,735;00:35:54,860;You will.
526;00:35:56,321;00:35:58,697;That bauble round your neck,
527;00:35:58,782;00:36:01,951;did you pay the iron price for it, or the gold?
528;00:36:03,245;00:36:04,829;I asked a question.
529;00:36:04,913;00:36:07,456;Did you pull it from the neck
529;00:36:04,913;00:36:07,456;of a corpse you made
530;00:36:07,541;00:36:11,794;or did you buy it to match your fine clothes?
531;00:36:13,964;00:36:16,423;Iron or gold?
532;00:36:19,553;00:36:20,594;Gold.
533;00:36:25,517;00:36:28,269;I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.
534;00:36:31,648;00:36:33,732;My fears have come true,
535;00:36:33,817;00:36:36,110;the Starks have made you theirs.
536;00:36:36,194;00:36:39,238;My blood is salt and iron.
536;00:36:36,194;00:36:39,238;Yet the Stark boy sends you to me
537;00:36:39,322;00:36:42,616;like a trained raven clutching his message.
538;00:36:42,742;00:36:44,535;The offer he makes is one I proposed.
539;00:36:44,619;00:36:47,246;He heeds your counsel?
539;00:36:44,619;00:36:47,246;I've lived with him,
540;00:36:47,372;00:36:48,873;hunted with him, fought at his side.
541;00:36:48,957;00:36:50,457;He thinks of me as a brother.
542;00:36:50,542;00:36:53,294;No, not here, not in my hearing.
543;00:36:53,378;00:36:55,671;You will not name him brother,
544;00:36:55,755;00:36:59,717;this son of the man who put
544;00:36:55,755;00:36:59,717;your true brothers to the sword.
545;00:36:59,801;00:37:02,595;Or have you forgotten your own blood?
546;00:37:02,679;00:37:04,597;I forget nothing.
547;00:37:04,681;00:37:06,515;I remember my brothers.
548;00:37:07,601;00:37:10,019;And I remember when my father was a king.
549;00:37:26,828;00:37:27,828;I see.
550;00:37:28,538;00:37:31,248;I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him
551;00:37:31,333;00:37:34,627;and he will make me
551;00:37:31,333;00:37:34,627;king of the Iron Islands once again.
552;00:37:34,711;00:37:37,379;I will lead the attack myself.
552;00:37:34,711;00:37:37,379;Oh, you will?
553;00:37:38,590;00:37:41,175;I'm your son, your only living heir.
554;00:37:41,259;00:37:43,177;Who else?
555;00:37:45,639;00:37:47,556;I told you to wait outside.
556;00:37:49,059;00:37:50,851;How did you get past the guards?
557;00:37:50,936;00:37:53,312;Anything with a cock is easy to fool.
558;00:37:54,189;00:37:55,522;My dear.
559;00:37:59,653;00:38:00,736;Yara?
560;00:38:01,196;00:38:03,197;So good to see you, brother.
561;00:38:04,115;00:38:07,618;This is a homecoming
561;00:38:04,115;00:38:07,618;I'll tell my grandchildren about.
562;00:38:10,455;00:38:12,748;She can't lead an attack!
562;00:38:10,455;00:38:12,748;And why not?
563;00:38:13,667;00:38:14,792;You're a woman!
564;00:38:14,876;00:38:18,295;You're the one in skirts.
564;00:38:14,876;00:38:18,295;This isn't Winterfell, boy.
565;00:38:18,463;00:38:20,965;Your sister took over command
565;00:38:18,463;00:38:20,965;of your eldest brother's ship
566;00:38:21,049;00:38:23,801;after your new father killed him.
567;00:38:23,885;00:38:26,845;What's dead may never die.
567;00:38:23,885;00:38:26,845;... dead may never die.
568;00:38:27,722;00:38:31,558;The only nights she's spent off these islands
568;00:38:27,722;00:38:31,558;have been spent on the sea.
569;00:38:32,686;00:38:34,603;She's commanded men.
570;00:38:34,688;00:38:36,188;She's killed men.
571;00:38:36,898;00:38:38,899;She knows who she is.
572;00:38:41,653;00:38:43,988;No man gives me a crown.
573;00:38:44,656;00:38:46,824;I pay the iron price.
574;00:38:47,325;00:38:49,243;I will take my crown,
575;00:38:49,786;00:38:51,954;for that is who I am.
576;00:38:52,747;00:38:54,790;That is who we have always been.
577;00:38:59,713;00:39:01,964;You won't stand a chance
577;00:38:59,713;00:39:01,964;against the Lannisters on your own.
578;00:39:02,090;00:39:04,758;Who said anything about the Lannisters?
579;00:39:12,517;00:39:15,352;You'll have your gold
579;00:39:12,517;00:39:15,352;when we take the treasury at King's Landing.
580;00:39:15,437;00:39:17,271;All these kings fighting for the throne,
581;00:39:17,355;00:39:20,190;and this Stannis has the smallest army.
582;00:39:20,275;00:39:22,693;Why would I bet on the man
582;00:39:20,275;00:39:22,693;with the worst chance?
583;00:39:23,069;00:39:24,737;Because you're a smart gambler.
584;00:39:25,572;00:39:28,490;Stannis has proved himself in war twice.
585;00:39:28,575;00:39:31,744;His baby brother has never set foot
585;00:39:28,575;00:39:31,744;on a battlefield.
586;00:39:31,828;00:39:33,579;Neither has the false King Joffrey.
587;00:39:33,663;00:39:35,622;And yet they both have larger armies.
588;00:39:35,707;00:39:37,541;Stannis has just begun the fight.
589;00:39:37,625;00:39:40,586;His bannermen will rally to his cause.
590;00:39:41,421;00:39:45,591;There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms
590;00:39:41,421;00:39:45,591;more honorable than Stannis Baratheon
591;00:39:45,675;00:39:47,092;or more worthy of loyalty.
592;00:39:47,177;00:39:48,594;What is the world coming to
593;00:39:48,678;00:39:51,221;when smugglers must vouch
593;00:39:48,678;00:39:51,221;for the honor of kings?
594;00:39:51,306;00:39:53,640;Mind your words, pirate.
594;00:39:51,306;00:39:53,640;Matthos.
595;00:39:53,725;00:39:55,434;You think I'm insulted?
596;00:39:55,518;00:39:58,395;I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate.
597;00:39:58,772;00:40:00,439;I don't sail for promises.
598;00:40:00,523;00:40:01,982;Of course you do.
599;00:40:02,484;00:40:05,069;Every time you leave harbor,
599;00:40:02,484;00:40:05,069;you're leaving on a promise,
600;00:40:05,153;00:40:06,612;a promise that somewhere on the sea,
601;00:40:06,696;00:40:09,031;somebody's got some gold
601;00:40:06,696;00:40:09,031;and you can take it from him.
602;00:40:09,115;00:40:11,658;That's a promise that always comes true.
602;00:40:09,115;00:40:11,658;As is mine.
603;00:40:12,285;00:40:14,119;You're not a young man, Salladhor.
604;00:40:14,204;00:40:17,664;And correct me if I'm wrong,
604;00:40:14,204;00:40:17,664;most pirates don't grow old.
605;00:40:18,583;00:40:19,875;Only the clever ones.
606;00:40:20,668;00:40:22,753;You want to spend
606;00:40:20,668;00:40:22,753;your last few years on the sea
607;00:40:22,837;00:40:26,590;stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers
607;00:40:22,837;00:40:26,590;and Myrenese silk merchants, then go.
608;00:40:26,674;00:40:29,843;They're out there waiting for you. That's easy.
609;00:40:30,303;00:40:32,137;What I'm offering you is hard.
610;00:40:34,349;00:40:37,142;Come with me and plunder
610;00:40:34,349;00:40:37,142;the greatest city in Westeros.
611;00:40:38,353;00:40:40,896;You'll be the richest man in Lys,
611;00:40:38,353;00:40:40,896;and the most famous.
612;00:40:40,980;00:40:44,817;They'll be singing songs about you
612;00:40:40,980;00:40:44,817;as long as men have voices to sing.
613;00:40:46,569;00:40:48,862;Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.
614;00:40:48,947;00:40:52,366;It is.
614;00:40:48,947;00:40:52,366;One thing, I want the queen.
615;00:40:52,492;00:40:55,327;The queen?
615;00:40:52,492;00:40:55,327;Cersei, I want her.
616;00:40:55,411;00:40:57,913;I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships.
617;00:40:57,997;00:41:00,165;And if we don't drown at the bottom
617;00:40:57,997;00:41:00,165;of Blackwater Bay,
618;00:41:00,250;00:41:03,460;I will fuck this blonde queen
618;00:41:00,250;00:41:03,460;and I'll fuck her well.
619;00:41:03,545;00:41:05,379;This war isn't about you.
620;00:41:06,381;00:41:09,133;We're not attacking King's Landing
620;00:41:06,381;00:41:09,133;so that you can rape the queen.
621;00:41:09,217;00:41:11,718;I'm not going to rape her.
621;00:41:09,217;00:41:11,718;I'm going to fuck her.
622;00:41:12,220;00:41:13,512;As if she would just let you.
623;00:41:13,596;00:41:15,430;You don't know how persuasive I am.
624;00:41:16,182;00:41:17,891;I've never tried to fuck you.
625;00:41:20,061;00:41:22,855;Stannis is the rightful king
625;00:41:20,061;00:41:22,855;and the Lord of Light,
626;00:41:22,939;00:41:24,398;the one true god...
627;00:41:24,524;00:41:25,983;I've been all over the world, my boy,
628;00:41:26,067;00:41:29,027;and everywhere I go,
628;00:41:26,067;00:41:29,027;people tell me about the true gods.
629;00:41:29,112;00:41:30,863;They all think they found the right one.
630;00:41:31,406;00:41:34,116;The one true god
630;00:41:31,406;00:41:34,116;is what's between a woman's legs,
631;00:41:34,242;00:41:36,743;and better yet, a queen's legs.
632;00:41:38,121;00:41:40,497;I never thought you'd have
632;00:41:38,121;00:41:40,497;a true believer for a son.
633;00:41:40,582;00:41:41,874;He's young yet.
634;00:41:43,293;00:41:46,128;I promise you the gold.
634;00:41:43,293;00:41:46,128;I promise you the glory.
635;00:41:46,212;00:41:47,713;I cannot promise you the queen.
636;00:41:51,676;00:41:53,093;You believe your king can win?
637;00:41:53,761;00:41:55,429;He is the one true king.
638;00:41:55,847;00:41:57,306;You Westerosi are funny people.
639;00:41:57,724;00:42:00,601;A man chops off your fingers
639;00:41:57,724;00:42:00,601;and you fall in love with him.
640;00:42:02,896;00:42:05,063;I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth.
641;00:42:05,148;00:42:07,900;You're the most honest smuggler I ever met.
642;00:42:08,735;00:42:11,028;Make me rich.
643;00:42:11,112;00:42:14,239;Get me to the gates
643;00:42:11,112;00:42:14,239;of King's Landing and I will.
644;00:42:26,252;00:42:27,920;When will the king have us sail?
645;00:42:28,004;00:42:30,047;As soon as his god wills it.
646;00:42:30,131;00:42:32,758;He's my god, too, and yours,
647;00:42:32,842;00:42:35,260;but you are too blind to see.
648;00:42:37,513;00:42:39,640;Let me teach you how to read.
648;00:42:37,513;00:42:39,640;Oh, you and your mother.
649;00:42:39,724;00:42:41,266;It won't take long.
649;00:42:39,724;00:42:41,266;You already know the letters.
650;00:42:41,351;00:42:43,560;The holy books are
650;00:42:41,351;00:42:43,560;much more persuasive than I can be.
651;00:42:43,645;00:42:45,395;I wish I had a god, truly.
652;00:42:45,480;00:42:48,232;I'm not mocking you,
652;00:42:45,480;00:42:48,232;but I've seen men pray to every god there is,
653;00:42:48,316;00:42:50,567;pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home.
654;00:42:50,652;00:42:53,362;None of it works.
654;00:42:50,652;00:42:53,362;But you always came home.
655;00:42:53,446;00:42:54,988;I wasn't praying.
656;00:42:55,949;00:42:57,741;But I was.
657;00:42:58,826;00:43:00,410;Every night that you were at sea,
658;00:43:00,495;00:43:03,330;I lit a candle and I prayed for you.
659;00:43:04,832;00:43:06,291;You want me to have a god?
660;00:43:06,376;00:43:09,461;Fine. King Stannis is my god.
661;00:43:09,545;00:43:11,964;He raised me up
661;00:43:09,545;00:43:11,964;and blessed me with his trust.
662;00:43:12,048;00:43:14,716;He gave you a future
662;00:43:12,048;00:43:14,716;I could never have imagined.
663;00:43:14,801;00:43:16,677;You know how to read.
663;00:43:14,801;00:43:16,677;You'll be a knight someday.
664;00:43:16,761;00:43:19,972;You think a fire god commanded all that?
665;00:43:20,056;00:43:23,350;It was Stannis, only Stannis.
666;00:43:23,851;00:43:26,395;Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.
667;00:43:26,479;00:43:29,231;Don't tell him that.
668;00:43:31,109;00:43:33,235;CERSEl: Lord Janos Slynt
668;00:43:31,109;00:43:33,235;was commander of the City Watch.
669;00:43:33,319;00:43:34,736;You had no right to exile him.
670;00:43:34,821;00:43:36,363;I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
671;00:43:36,447;00:43:39,157;You're serving as the King's Hand
671;00:43:36,447;00:43:39,157;till Father gets here.
672;00:43:39,242;00:43:40,575;I am Queen Regent.
673;00:43:40,660;00:43:42,286;Listen to me, Queen Regent.
674;00:43:42,370;00:43:43,829;You're losing the people.
675;00:43:44,706;00:43:46,832;Do you hear me?
675;00:43:44,706;00:43:46,832;The people.
676;00:43:47,208;00:43:48,625;You think I care?
677;00:43:48,710;00:43:52,546;You might find it difficult
677;00:43:48,710;00:43:52,546;to rule over millions who want you dead.
678;00:43:53,339;00:43:57,467;Half the city will starve when winter comes.
678;00:43:53,339;00:43:57,467;The other half will plot to overthrow you.
679;00:43:57,552;00:44:01,138;And your gold-plated thugs
679;00:43:57,552;00:44:01,138;just gave them their rallying cry,
680;00:44:01,723;00:44:03,974;The Queen slaughters babies.
681;00:44:06,644;00:44:09,187;You don't even have the decency to deny it.
682;00:44:19,741;00:44:21,908;It wasn't you who gave the order, was it?
683;00:44:22,869;00:44:24,578;Joffrey didn't even tell you.
684;00:44:27,457;00:44:28,999;Did he tell you?
685;00:44:29,083;00:44:30,917;I imagine that would be even worse.
686;00:44:31,210;00:44:33,378;He did what needed to be done.
687;00:44:33,463;00:44:36,506;You want to be Hand of the King?
687;00:44:33,463;00:44:36,506;You want to rule?
688;00:44:36,591;00:44:39,968;This is what ruling is,
688;00:44:36,591;00:44:39,968;lying on a bed of weeds,
689;00:44:40,053;00:44:41,845;ripping them out by the root, one by one,
690;00:44:41,929;00:44:43,638;before they strangle you in your sleep.
691;00:44:43,723;00:44:46,141;I'm no king,
691;00:44:43,723;00:44:46,141;but I think there's more to ruling than that.
692;00:44:46,225;00:44:47,768;I don't care what you think!
693;00:44:48,269;00:44:49,603;You've never taken it seriously.
694;00:44:49,687;00:44:51,396;You haven't, Jaime hasn't.
695;00:44:55,568;00:44:57,069;It's all fallen on me.
696;00:45:01,741;00:45:05,160;As has Jaime, repeatedly,
696;00:45:01,741;00:45:05,160;according to Stannis Baratheon.
697;00:45:10,666;00:45:12,125;You're funny.
698;00:45:15,963;00:45:18,048;You've always been funny...
699;00:45:19,050;00:45:22,344;but none of yourjokes will ever match
699;00:45:19,050;00:45:22,344;the first one, will they?
700;00:45:24,138;00:45:25,806;You remember?
701;00:45:26,849;00:45:29,226;Back when you ripped my mother open
701;00:45:26,849;00:45:29,226;on your way out of her
702;00:45:29,310;00:45:31,186;and she bled to death?
703;00:45:33,189;00:45:35,273;She was my mother, too.
704;00:45:35,483;00:45:36,942;Mother gone...
705;00:45:39,362;00:45:40,987;for the sake of you.
706;00:45:43,950;00:45:46,743;There's no biggerjoke in the world than that.
707;00:46:09,016;00:46:11,935;Your Grace.
707;00:46:09,016;00:46:11,935;Your Grace.
708;00:46:12,019;00:46:14,062;How did you fare with your pirate?
709;00:46:14,147;00:46:17,566;Salladhor Saan will join our fleet, 30 ships.
710;00:46:17,650;00:46:19,568;His men know how to fight.
711;00:46:19,652;00:46:23,113;In my experience,
711;00:46:19,652;00:46:23,113;pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.
712;00:46:23,197;00:46:24,614;It does seem the wiser choice.
713;00:46:24,699;00:46:27,033;There won't be a choice this time.
714;00:46:28,327;00:46:29,411;Do you trust him?
715;00:46:30,079;00:46:33,665;Salladhor Saan is an old friend.
715;00:46:30,079;00:46:33,665;I've known him 30 years.
716;00:46:33,749;00:46:35,667;I've never trusted him.
717;00:46:36,252;00:46:39,546;Now, once he gets the smell of gold
717;00:46:36,252;00:46:39,546;he never stops.
718;00:46:40,339;00:46:43,216;Well, if he does his job, he'll have his share.
719;00:46:46,971;00:46:48,013;Leave us.
720;00:46:54,729;00:46:55,729;At once, Your Grace.
721;00:47:03,029;00:47:06,072;The Lord of Light shines through you,
721;00:47:03,029;00:47:06,072;young warrior.
722;00:47:11,871;00:47:12,954;Come.
723;00:47:20,546;00:47:21,796;What did you say to him?
724;00:47:21,881;00:47:24,799;I told him death by fire is the purest death.
725;00:47:25,801;00:47:27,802;Why?
725;00:47:25,801;00:47:27,802;Because it is true.
726;00:47:29,847;00:47:31,264;You're troubled, my king.
727;00:47:32,183;00:47:33,433;Yeah.
728;00:47:33,601;00:47:36,102;These armies are toys for the Lord of Light.
729;00:47:36,312;00:47:39,189;Tell your lord to burn them, then.
730;00:47:39,273;00:47:40,690;I tell him nothing.
731;00:47:40,775;00:47:43,777;I pray for his commands and I obey.
732;00:47:45,821;00:47:49,616;My little brother has 100,000 men,
732;00:47:45,821;00:47:49,616;according to the scouts,
733;00:47:49,700;00:47:52,536;men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
734;00:47:52,620;00:47:54,454;You must have faith.
735;00:47:54,789;00:47:55,956;Faith?
736;00:47:57,625;00:48:00,252;In a real war, the side with
736;00:47:57,625;00:48:00,252;the greater number wins,
737;00:48:00,336;00:48:01,962;nine times out of ten.
738;00:48:02,463;00:48:03,880;Then we must be the 1 Oth.
739;00:48:04,340;00:48:07,092;I cannot defeat my brother in the field.
740;00:48:08,427;00:48:11,805;And I can't take King's Landing
740;00:48:08,427;00:48:11,805;without the men he's stolen.
741;00:48:13,349;00:48:16,977;I have seen the path to victory in the flames.
742;00:48:18,688;00:48:21,856;But first, you must give yourself
742;00:48:18,688;00:48:21,856;to the Lord of Light.
743;00:48:21,941;00:48:24,651;I've said the words, damn you.
744;00:48:28,406;00:48:30,574;I burned the idols.
745;00:48:33,953;00:48:37,372;You must give all of yourself.
746;00:48:42,670;00:48:43,753;I have a wife.
747;00:48:46,048;00:48:47,299;I took a vow.
748;00:48:49,135;00:48:52,512;She's sickly, weak...
749;00:48:54,640;00:48:56,433;Shut away in a tower.
750;00:48:57,768;00:48:59,769;She disgusts you.
751;00:49:03,190;00:49:05,984;And she's given you nothing,
752;00:49:06,193;00:49:09,779;no sons, only stillborns,
753;00:49:11,032;00:49:12,574;only death.
754;00:49:18,998;00:49:23,043;I will give you a son, my king.
755;00:49:26,047;00:49:27,088;A son?
