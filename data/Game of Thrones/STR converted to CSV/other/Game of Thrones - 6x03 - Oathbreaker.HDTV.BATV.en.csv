76;00:09:06,360;00:09:09,120;Won't be long. We'll be in the south soon.

82;00:09:26,920;00:09:30,440;There won't be a place for you there or for Little Sam.
83;00:09:30,960;00:09:33,360;I stayed at Castle Black. There's no women allowed there.
84;00:09:33,360;00:09:35,680;The Citadel isn't Castle Black.
85;00:09:35,880;00:09:38,080;I don't have a Jon Snow or
86;00:09:38,200;00:09:41,880;Maester Aemon to help me bend the rules.
87;00:09:42,320;00:09:43,800;I'll stay in Oldtown, then.
88;00:09:43,800;00:09:45,320;By yourself?

90;00:09:48,680;00:09:53,160;So if we're not going to Oldtown, where are you taking me?
91;00:09:53,280;00:09:55,440;To my home.
92;00:09:56,280;00:09:58,400;Horn Hill.

97;00:10:11,560;00:10:14,280;That's what you said.
98;00:10:29,840;00:10:33,440;I said that because I want you and Little Sam to be safe.
99;00:10:33,720;00:10:35,520;That's all I want--
100;00:10:35,760;00:10:40,880;to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes, so you'll be safe.

104;00:10:50,040;00:10:53,120;I care about you and him.
105;00:10:54,760;00:10:56,840;I know that, Sam.
106;00:10:56,840;00:10:59,600;And he does, too.

196;00:23:11,960;00:23:13,200;You've done a lot.
197;00:23:13,720;00:23:18,800;You've sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do.
198;00:23:20,320;00:23:25,440;And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons.
199;00:23:25,560;00:23:29,400;The Unsullied and the Second Sons are foreign soldiers
200;00:23:29,480;00:23:34,520;brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history.
201;00:23:34,920;00:23:36,520;I understand.
202;00:23:37,440;00:23:41,920;Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective.
203;00:23:42,720;00:23:46,640;I have a different perspective, of course.
204;00:23:46,680;00:23:49,920;I think it's important that you try to see things from my perspective
205;00:23:49,960;00:23:52,720;just as I will try to see them from yours.
206;00:23:52,920;00:23:59,040;Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy.
207;00:24:00,680;00:24:04,440;That is how you pronounce it-- 'Dom'?
208;00:24:04,840;00:24:08,520;I'm afraid I don't really speak the language.
209;00:24:09,080;00:24:10,960;Such a handsome boy.
210;00:24:11,120;00:24:15,280;Those big, brown eyes. Good luck keeping the ladies away.
211;00:24:15,920;00:24:19,160;Yes, you're a true liberator, aren't you?
212;00:24:19,400;00:24:22,400;You won't torture me, you'll just threaten my son.
213;00:24:22,760;00:24:24,840;Children are blameless.
214;00:24:25,480;00:24:27,480;I have never hurt them.
215;00:24:28,120;00:24:32,800;Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you.
216;00:24:33,880;00:24:38,920;But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers.
217;00:24:38,920;00:24:44,200;We both know the penalty for that crime.
218;00:24:47,080;00:24:50,240;How will poor Dom get on without his mother?
219;00:24:50,560;00:24:52,400;And with his breathing problem.
220;00:24:52,480;00:24:55,200;If I tell you anything, they'll kill me.
221;00:24:55,240;00:24:58,000;So either you kill me or they do.
222;00:24:58,200;00:25:01,880;Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem.
223;00:25:02,440;00:25:04,400;There is a third option, though.
224;00:25:04,520;00:25:07,800;A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.
225;00:25:07,800;00:25:12,600;I've already booked passage for a woman and her young son.
226;00:25:12,800;00:25:16,120;I'll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again.
227;00:25:16,120;00:25:21,520;Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it.
228;00:25:21,560;00:25:24,320;Far too heavy for me.
229;00:25:24,800;00:25:26,640;The boat sails at dawn.
230;00:25:27,160;00:25:29,320;You need to decide now.
231;00:25:29,960;00:25:34,400;A new life for you and Dom or...
232;00:25:50,240;00:25:52,080;What should we do while we wait?
233;00:25:52,080;00:25:54,240;To pass the time, what should we do?
234;00:25:54,240;00:25:56,560;What should we talk about?
235;00:25:58,960;00:26:00,560;You speak 19 languages.
236;00:26:00,680;00:26:03,840;You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things.
237;00:26:04,320;00:26:07,320;You two, you spend a great deal of time together.
238;00:26:07,320;00:26:10,640;What would you be talking about if I weren't here?
239;00:26:11,240;00:26:12,600;Patrol.
240;00:26:13,960;00:26:16,640;When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied.
241;00:26:17,160;00:26:19,360;What we see on patrol.
242;00:26:19,560;00:26:21,240;Who we captured on patrol.
243;00:26:21,320;00:26:24,040;That's good. That's very good.
244;00:26:25,680;00:26:27,680;But that's a report.
245;00:26:28,360;00:26:30,760;I was thinking more of a conversation.

251;00:26:50,040;00:26:54,640;All right, no conversations. Let's play a game.
252;00:26:56,720;00:26:58,840;You don't play games, either one of you, ever?
253;00:26:58,840;00:27:00,080;Games are for children.
