2;00:02:05,872;00:02:08,953;the crime of your bannerman,
3;00:02:08,954;00:02:10,834;Gregor Clegane, The Mountain.
4;00:02:12,184;00:02:16,287;Arrive within a fortnight
4;00:02:12,184;00:02:16,287;or be branded an enemy of the crown.
5;00:02:18,261;00:02:22,250;Poor Ned Stark. Brave man,
5;00:02:18,261;00:02:22,250;terrible judgement.
6;00:02:26,829;00:02:29,025;Attacking him was stupid.
7;00:02:37,451;00:02:38,914;Lannister...
8;00:02:39,950;00:02:41,912;don't act like fools.
9;00:02:47,639;00:02:50,177;You're gonna say
9;00:02:47,639;00:02:50,177;something clever?
10;00:02:51,265;00:02:53,326;Go on, say something clever.
11;00:02:56,764;00:02:58,876;Catelyn Stark took my brother.
12;00:03:02,828;00:03:04,440;Why is he still alive?
13;00:03:04,579;00:03:05,664;Tyrion?
14;00:03:05,830;00:03:07,226;Ned Stark.
15;00:03:08,455;00:03:10,366;One of our men interfered...
16;00:03:10,467;00:03:13,777;speared him through the leg,
16;00:03:10,467;00:03:13,777;before I could finish him.
17;00:03:14,452;00:03:16,337;Why is he still alive?
18;00:03:17,516;00:03:19,630;It wouldn't have been clean.
19;00:03:19,789;00:03:20,953;Clean?
20;00:03:22,642;00:03:26,429;You spent too much time
20;00:03:22,642;00:03:26,429;worrying about what other people think of you.
21;00:03:26,480;00:03:28,828;I could care less what
21;00:03:26,480;00:03:28,828;what anyone thinks of me.
22;00:03:28,866;00:03:31,601;That's what you want people
22;00:03:28,866;00:03:31,601;to think of you.
23;00:03:31,641;00:03:33,054;It's the truth.
24;00:03:34,456;00:03:39,129;And you hear them whispering Kingslayer
24;00:03:34,456;00:03:39,129;behind your back, doesn't it bother you?
25;00:03:41,267;00:03:43,477;Of course it bothers me.
26;00:03:43,830;00:03:47,667;A lion doesn't concern himself
26;00:03:43,830;00:03:47,667;with the opinion of a sheep.
27;00:03:50,604;00:03:52,955;I suppose I should be grateful
27;00:03:50,604;00:03:52,955;that your varity,
28;00:03:52,956;00:03:55,606;got in a way of your reckelessnes.
29;00:03:57,579;00:04:01,480;I'm giving you half of our forces.
29;00:03:57,579;00:04:01,480;30.000 men.
30;00:04:02,328;00:04:05,422;And we'll bring that to
30;00:04:02,328;00:04:05,422;Catelyn Stark girlhood home...
31;00:04:05,639;00:04:09,542;and remind her that Lannisters
31;00:04:05,639;00:04:09,542;pay their debts
32;00:04:11,078;00:04:14,656;I didn't realize you place such
32;00:04:11,078;00:04:14,656;a high value on my brother's life.
33;00:04:14,705;00:04:16,227;He's a Lannister.
34;00:04:16,956;00:04:20,278;Maybe the lowest of the Lannister,
34;00:04:16,956;00:04:20,278;but he's one of us.
35;00:04:20,467;00:04:22,842;And everyday that he remain a prisoner
36;00:04:22,964;00:04:25,606;the less our name command respect.
37;00:04:25,952;00:04:30,478;So the lion does concern himself with the opinion...
37;00:04:25,952;00:04:30,478;No, that's not an opinion, it's a fact.
38;00:04:33,016;00:04:35,509;If another house can seize
38;00:04:33,016;00:04:35,509;one of our own
39;00:04:35,544;00:04:37,856;and hold him captive, with impunity...
40;00:04:38,357;00:04:40,992;we are no longer house to be feared.
41;00:04:45,268;00:04:46,541;Your mother is dead.
42;00:04:47,454;00:04:49,528;Before long I'll be dead.
43;00:04:49,563;00:04:50,728;and you...
44;00:04:51,266;00:04:52,290;and your brother...
45;00:04:52,578;00:04:55,167;and your sister and all of her children...
46;00:04:55,208;00:04:59,419;all of us dead,
46;00:04:55,208;00:04:59,419;all of us rotting underground.
47;00:05:00,455;00:05:03,104;Is the family name
47;00:05:00,455;00:05:03,104;that lives on.
48;00:05:03,208;00:05:05,341;It's all that lives on.
49;00:05:05,833;00:05:10,233;Not your personal glory
49;00:05:05,833;00:05:10,233;not your honor... but family.
50;00:05:11,644;00:05:13,591;You understand?
51;00:05:25,395;00:05:28,994;You're blessed with ability
51;00:05:25,395;00:05:28,994;that few men possess.
52;00:05:29,079;00:05:33,009;You're blessed you belong to
52;00:05:29,079;00:05:33,009;the most powerful family in the kingdom.
53;00:05:33,329;00:05:35,819;And you still blessed
53;00:05:33,329;00:05:35,819;with youth.
54;00:05:36,393;00:05:38,893;And what you've done
54;00:05:36,393;00:05:38,893;with this blessing?
55;00:05:40,082;00:05:43,708;You served as the glorified bodyguard
55;00:05:40,082;00:05:43,708;for two kings..
56;00:05:43,709;00:05:46,731;One a mad man, the other are drunk.
57;00:05:52,083;00:05:55,959;The future of our family will be
57;00:05:52,083;00:05:55,959;determined in these next few months.
58;00:05:55,960;00:05:59,546;We could established a dinasty
58;00:05:55,960;00:05:59,546;that would last a thousand years...
59;00:06:00,020;00:06:03,680;or we could collapse into nothing.
59;00:06:00,020;00:06:03,680;As the Targaryen's did.
60;00:06:06,643;00:06:10,681;I need you to become a man
60;00:06:06,643;00:06:10,681;you're always meant to be.
61;00:06:11,252;00:06:13,627;Not next year, not tomorrow...
62;00:06:14,601;00:06:15,877;Now.
63;00:06:45,590;00:06:46,678;You're in pain.
64;00:06:53,092;00:06:54,978;I've had worse, my lady.
65;00:06:56,152;00:06:58,065;Perhaps it's time to go hoome.
66;00:06:58,529;00:07:00,466;The south doesn't seems to agree with you..
67;00:07:00,467;00:07:03,041;I knwo the truth Jon Arryn died for..
68;00:07:04,089;00:07:05,817;Do you, lord Stark?
69;00:07:06,779;00:07:10,238;Is that why you called me here?
69;00:07:06,779;00:07:10,238;To pose me riddles?
70;00:07:11,101;00:07:12,673;Has he done this before?
71;00:07:14,442;00:07:15,979;Jaime would've killed him.
72;00:07:17,279;00:07:19,690;My brother's worth
72;00:07:17,279;00:07:19,690;a thousand of your friend.
73;00:07:19,691;00:07:20,778;Your brother...
74;00:07:21,440;00:07:22,591;or your lover?
75;00:07:27,754;00:07:30,913;Targaryens wed brothers and sisters
75;00:07:27,754;00:07:30,913;for 300 years..
76;00:07:30,914;00:07:32,591;to keep bloodlines pure.
77;00:07:33,067;00:07:35,355;Jaime and I are more than
77;00:07:33,067;00:07:35,355;brother and sister.
78;00:07:35,379;00:07:37,441;We shared a womb.
79;00:07:37,442;00:07:40,444;Came to this world together,
79;00:07:37,442;00:07:40,444;we belong together.
80;00:07:41,192;00:07:43,156;My son saw you with him.
81;00:07:50,067;00:07:52,157;Do you love your children?
81;00:07:50,067;00:07:52,157;With all my heart.
82;00:07:52,192;00:07:55,335;No more than I love mine.
82;00:07:52,192;00:07:55,335;And they're all Jaime's.
83;00:07:55,395;00:07:56,609;Thank the Gods.
84;00:07:56,610;00:08:00,126;In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores
84;00:07:56,610;00:08:00,126;for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed,
85;00:08:00,127;00:08:01,950;I finished him off another ways
86;00:08:01,951;00:08:05,193;In the morning he doesn't remember.
86;00:08:01,951;00:08:05,193;You've always hated him.
87;00:08:05,343;00:08:06,549;Hated him?
88;00:08:07,098;00:08:08,567;I worshipped him.
89;00:08:08,720;00:08:12,706;Every girl in the southern kingdom
89;00:08:08,720;00:08:12,706;dreamt of him but he was mine by oath.
90;00:08:13,094;00:08:16,930;And when I finally saw him on our wedding day
90;00:08:13,094;00:08:16,930;in the Sept of Baelor.
91;00:08:17,031;00:08:21,556;lean and fierce, and black beared
91;00:08:17,031;00:08:21,556;it was the happiest moment of my life.
92;00:08:22,906;00:08:25,280;And that night he crawl on top of me,
92;00:08:22,906;00:08:25,280;stinking of wine
93;00:08:25,315;00:08:28,399;and did what he did what little he could do
94;00:08:30,182;00:08:32,492;and whispered in my ear : Lyanna.
95;00:08:34,530;00:08:37,240;Your sister was a corpse
95;00:08:34,530;00:08:37,240;and I was a living girl
96;00:08:37,241;00:08:39,032;and he loved her more than me.
97;00:08:41,345;00:08:44,530;When the king return from his hunts,
97;00:08:41,345;00:08:44,530;I'll tell him the truth.
98;00:08:44,531;00:08:47,657;You must be gone by then...
98;00:08:44,531;00:08:47,657;you and your children.
99;00:08:47,777;00:08:50,220;I will not have that blood on my hands.
100;00:08:50,513;00:08:52,488;Go as far away as you can..
101;00:08:53,075;00:08:55,312;With as many men as you can.
102;00:08:55,717;00:08:57,163;Because wherever you go...
103;00:08:57,951;00:08:59,914;Robert's wrath will follow you.
104;00:09:00,512;00:09:02,426;And what of my wrath, lord Stark?
105;00:09:03,139;00:09:05,300;You should have taken the realm
105;00:09:03,139;00:09:05,300;for yourself.
106;00:09:05,515;00:09:08,589;Jaime told me about the day
106;00:09:05,515;00:09:08,589;King's Landing fell.
107;00:09:08,639;00:09:11,351;He was sitting in the Iron Throne
107;00:09:08,639;00:09:11,351;and you made him give it up.
108;00:09:11,450;00:09:15,840;All you needed to do is claim the step
108;00:09:11,450;00:09:15,840;yourself. Such a sad mistake.
109;00:09:16,505;00:09:19,217;I've made many mistakes in my life..
110;00:09:20,253;00:09:22,042;but that wasn't one of them.
111;00:09:22,066;00:09:23,442;Oh, but it was.
112;00:09:24,629;00:09:28,230;When you play the game of thrones,
112;00:09:24,629;00:09:28,230;you win or you die.
113;00:09:29,315;00:09:30,843;There is no middle ground.
114;00:10:18,942;00:10:21,766;No, No, No, No..
115;00:10:23,218;00:10:25,634;is that what they teach you
115;00:10:23,218;00:10:25,634;up in the North?
116;00:10:27,156;00:10:30,119;And you, wherever you're from.
117;00:10:31,093;00:10:34,744;Do you have any idea
117;00:10:31,093;00:10:34,744;how ridiculous you sound?
118;00:10:35,032;00:10:38,244;Either of you understand the thing that I'm saying?
119;00:10:39,219;00:10:40,496;Yes, my lord.
120;00:10:41,344;00:10:43,869;Lets start over. Shall we?
121;00:10:44,967;00:10:48,558;You be the man, and you be the woman.
122;00:10:53,594;00:10:54,908;Go ahead.
123;00:10:57,468;00:10:58,844;Slowly.
124;00:11:08,032;00:11:12,932;You're not fooling them,
124;00:11:08,032;00:11:12,932;they just paid you, they know what you are.
125;00:11:13,469;00:11:15,684;They know its all just an act
126;00:11:15,781;00:11:18,744;Your job is to make them
126;00:11:15,781;00:11:18,744;forget what they know.
127;00:11:19,044;00:11:20,493;And that takes time.
128;00:11:21,533;00:11:22,850;You need to..
129;00:11:23,388;00:11:25,746;ease into it.
130;00:11:28,094;00:11:29,370;Go ahead.
131;00:11:30,471;00:11:33,058;Ease into it.
132;00:11:42,032;00:11:45,121;He's winding you over,
132;00:11:42,032;00:11:45,121;inspite of yourself.
133;00:11:45,221;00:11:47,434;You starting to like this.
134;00:11:48,533;00:11:50,005;He wants to believe you.
135;00:11:50,094;00:11:52,673;He's enjoyed his cock since he was old enough
136;00:11:52,674;00:11:54,058;to play with a boy, shouldn't you?
137;00:11:54,160;00:11:57,531;He knows, he's better than other men.
138;00:11:57,532;00:12:01,245;He's always known it deep down inside
138;00:11:57,532;00:12:01,245;now he has proof.
139;00:12:01,735;00:12:02,822;He's so good...
140;00:12:03,823;00:12:08,309;he's reaching something deep inside of you
140;00:12:03,823;00:12:08,309;that no one even knew was there.
141;00:12:08,597;00:12:11,247;Overcoming your very nature..
142;00:12:13,348;00:12:15,636;Why don't you join us, my lord?
143;00:12:16,908;00:12:19,134;I'm saving myself for another.
144;00:12:19,996;00:12:21,843;What she doesn't know
144;00:12:19,996;00:12:21,843;will not hurt her?
145;00:12:21,844;00:12:23,323;A stupid saying..
146;00:12:24,095;00:12:27,734;What we don't know is usually
146;00:12:24,095;00:12:27,734;what get us killed.
147;00:12:28,722;00:12:30,434;She must be very beautiful.
148;00:12:30,473;00:12:34,398;No, not really.
148;00:12:30,473;00:12:34,398;Impeccable bloodlines, though.
149;00:12:34,471;00:12:36,371;I do believe my lord in love.
150;00:12:36,409;00:12:39,634;For many years.
150;00:12:36,409;00:12:39,634;Most of my life really.
151;00:12:40,100;00:12:41,600;Play with her ass.
152;00:12:41,701;00:12:43,401;And she loved me too.
153;00:12:44,202;00:12:46,202;I was her little confidant.
154;00:12:47,203;00:12:51,003;A play thing. She could tell me anything,
154;00:12:47,203;00:12:51,003;anything at all.
155;00:12:51,404;00:12:55,604;She told me about
155;00:12:51,404;00:12:55,604;all the horses that she liked.
156;00:12:55,605;00:13:00,005;The castle that she want to live in.
156;00:12:55,605;00:13:00,005;The man that she wanted to marry.
157;00:13:00,707;00:13:02,207;A northener..
158;00:13:02,608;00:13:04,608;with a jaw like an anvil.
159;00:13:05,408;00:13:09,908;So I challenged him to a duel. I mean,
159;00:13:05,408;00:13:09,908;why not? I'd read all the stories.
160;00:13:10,309;00:13:14,500;The little hero always beats
160;00:13:10,309;00:13:14,500;the big villain in all the stories.
161;00:13:14,592;00:13:18,400;In the end...
161;00:13:14,592;00:13:18,400;she wouldn't even let him kill me.
162;00:13:18,601;00:13:21,101;He's just a boy, she said.
163;00:13:21,402;00:13:23,202;Please don't hurt him.
164;00:13:23,903;00:13:28,203;So he gave me a nice little scar to remember
164;00:13:23,903;00:13:28,203;and by enough they went
165;00:13:28,204;00:13:30,704;And she still married to him?
165;00:13:28,204;00:13:30,704;Oh, no.
166;00:13:30,905;00:13:33,605;He got himself killed before the wedding.
167;00:13:34,906;00:13:39,006;And she ended up with his brother,
167;00:13:34,906;00:13:39,006;an even more impressive spciment.
168;00:13:39,307;00:13:41,607;She love him, I'm afraid.
169;00:13:41,908;00:13:43,508;And why wouldn't she, I mean?
170;00:13:43,608;00:13:47,008;Who could compare to him,
170;00:13:43,608;00:13:47,008;he just so...
171;00:13:53,603;00:13:54,703;good.
172;00:13:57,304;00:14:00,204;Do you know what I learned
172;00:13:57,304;00:14:00,204;losing that duel?
173;00:14:00,705;00:14:02,605;I learned that I'll never win.
174;00:14:03,006;00:14:05,906;Not that way.
174;00:14:03,006;00:14:05,906;That's their game.
175;00:14:06,507;00:14:08,007;Their rules.
176;00:14:08,908;00:14:10,808;I'm not going to fight them.
177;00:14:11,109;00:14:12,409;I'm going to fuck them.
178;00:14:13,110;00:14:16,110;That's what I know, that's what I am.
179;00:14:16,611;00:14:20,211;And only by admitting what we are,
179;00:14:16,611;00:14:20,211;can we get what we want.
180;00:14:21,212;00:14:22,612;And what do you want?
181;00:14:23,513;00:14:26,113;Oh, everything, my dear.
182;00:14:26,714;00:14:28,314;Everything there is.
183;00:14:31,615;00:14:34,815;Now wash yourself,
183;00:14:31,615;00:14:34,815;both of you are working tonight.
184;00:15:05,524;00:15:07,851;You're very lucky girl,
184;00:15:05,524;00:15:07,851;do you know that?
185;00:15:11,459;00:15:14,570;Where I come from we don't show mercy
185;00:15:11,459;00:15:14,570;to criminals.
186;00:15:14,738;00:15:18,332;Where I come from,
186;00:15:14,738;00:15:18,332;if someone like you attacked a little lord..
187;00:15:18,759;00:15:21,992;the low tide will lay you on your back,
187;00:15:18,759;00:15:21,992;on the beach..
188;00:15:22,161;00:15:24,732;your hands and feet chained to four stakes..
189;00:15:25,206;00:15:27,712;sea will coming cloaser and closer.
190;00:15:28,234;00:15:32,222;You'll see death creeping toward you,
190;00:15:28,234;00:15:32,222;a few inches at a time.
191;00:15:33,622;00:15:34,985;Where do you come from?
192;00:15:35,615;00:15:37,061;The Iron Islands.
193;00:15:37,833;00:15:39,099;They far away?
194;00:15:39,505;00:15:41,429;You've never heard of the Iron Islands?
195;00:15:41,464;00:15:45,281;Trust me, you've never heard
195;00:15:41,464;00:15:45,281;where I'm from neither.
196;00:15:46,349;00:15:48,509;Trust me, my lord.
197;00:15:51,471;00:15:53,696;You're not living in the wilderness anymore.
198;00:15:53,872;00:15:57,836;In civilised land, you advert
198;00:15:53,872;00:15:57,836;your betters by their proper titles.
199;00:15:58,432;00:15:59,672;And what's that?
200;00:16:00,092;00:16:01,172;Lord.
201;00:16:01,655;00:16:02,783;Why?
202;00:16:04,082;00:16:05,074;Why?
203;00:16:05,868;00:16:07,643;What do you mean why?
204;00:16:07,859;00:16:10,986;My father is Balon Greyjoy,
204;00:16:07,859;00:16:10,986;lord of the Iron Islands.
205;00:16:11,061;00:16:12,955;What's that got to do with you?
206;00:16:14,175;00:16:18,111;Your father's lord,
206;00:16:14,175;00:16:18,111;how can you be lord too?
207;00:16:18,802;00:16:22,353;I will be lord after my father..
207;00:16:18,802;00:16:22,353;So you're not lord now.
208;00:16:22,372;00:16:23,469;No, you...
209;00:16:25,786;00:16:27,596;You having a go at me?
210;00:16:27,795;00:16:28,795;Is that it?
211;00:16:29,472;00:16:32,324;Just don't understand
211;00:16:29,472;00:16:32,324;how you southerner do things.
212;00:16:32,351;00:16:33,654;I'm not a southerner.
213;00:16:33,710;00:16:35,906;You're from south of The Wall...
214;00:16:36,507;00:16:38,707;that make you southerner to me.
215;00:16:41,033;00:16:43,872;You're an impudent little wench,
215;00:16:41,033;00:16:43,872;aren't you?
216;00:16:44,746;00:16:48,542;Couldn't say, my lord.
216;00:16:44,746;00:16:48,542;Didn't know what impunent means.
217;00:16:48,808;00:16:52,040;Impudent. It means rude.
218;00:16:52,694;00:16:54,011;Disrespectful.
219;00:16:58,239;00:17:00,171;Do you want to loose that chain?
220;00:17:02,712;00:17:04,346;Theon Greyjoy!
221;00:17:05,310;00:17:07,570;The lady is our guest.
222;00:17:07,810;00:17:09,148;Thought she was our prisoner.
223;00:17:09,212;00:17:12,856;Are the two mutually exclusive,
223;00:17:09,212;00:17:12,856;in your experience?
224;00:17:23,420;00:17:26,419;Chances are I won't be nearby
224;00:17:23,420;00:17:26,419;the next time that happens.
225;00:17:26,422;00:17:28,658;I'm used to worst than him.
226;00:17:29,509;00:17:32,410;I'm used to men
226;00:17:29,509;00:17:32,410;that can chew that boy up.
227;00:17:32,445;00:17:34,784;And pick their teeth with his bones.
228;00:17:41,109;00:17:42,521;Why did you come here?
229;00:17:42,980;00:17:44,859;Didn't mean to come here.
230;00:17:45,541;00:17:50,217;Meant to get much further south
230;00:17:45,541;00:17:50,217;than this. As far as south as south goes.
231;00:17:51,035;00:17:53,216;Before the long night comes.
232;00:17:53,727;00:17:54,782;Why?
233;00:17:55,005;00:17:56,381;What do you afraid of?
234;00:17:57,294;00:18:01,392;Those thing that sleep in the day
234;00:17:57,294;00:18:01,392;and hunt at night
235;00:18:01,881;00:18:06,015;Owl and shadowcats...
235;00:18:01,881;00:18:06,015;I'm not talking about owl and shadowcats.
236;00:18:10,171;00:18:12,422;The thing you speak of..
237;00:18:13,295;00:18:15,805;have been gone for thousand of years.
238;00:18:15,884;00:18:17,794;It wasn't gone, old man.
239;00:18:19,395;00:18:20,995;They were sleeping.
240;00:18:22,115;00:18:24,581;And they're sleeping no more.
241;00:18:33,358;00:18:34,993;I missed girls.
242;00:18:36,154;00:18:38,800;Not even talking to them,
242;00:18:36,154;00:18:38,800;I never talk to them.
243;00:18:40,747;00:18:42,397;Just lookin' at them.
244;00:18:42,618;00:18:44,081;Hearing them giggle.
245;00:18:49,857;00:18:51,574;Don't you missed girls?
246;00:18:56,918;00:18:58,006;Riders!
247;00:18:58,910;00:19:01,739;The horn. We have to blow the horn.
248;00:19:02,754;00:19:03,906;Why is he alone?
249;00:19:06,641;00:19:09,010;One blast for a ranger returning
250;00:19:09,357;00:19:10,794;Two for wildlings
251;00:19:11,233;00:19:13,644;Three..
251;00:19:11,233;00:19:13,644;He's no rider.
252;00:19:47,849;00:19:49,941;That's my uncle Benjen rode..
253;00:19:57,409;00:19:58,610;where's my uncle?
254;00:20:02,941;00:20:03,943;Ned!
255;00:20:06,471;00:20:07,718;Robert...
256;00:20:08,220;00:20:10,721;we are hunting... a boar...
257;00:20:17,721;00:20:20,595;I should have spent more time with you.
258;00:20:21,607;00:20:24,180;Shown to you how to be a man.
259;00:20:27,753;00:20:30,402;I was never meant to be a father.
260;00:20:50,424;00:20:51,432;Go on....
261;00:20:52,607;00:20:54,470;you don't want to see this.
262;00:21:08,855;00:21:10,114;My fault..
263;00:21:10,980;00:21:12,381;Too much wine..
264;00:21:13,002;00:21:15,070;Missed my thrust..
265;00:21:23,981;00:21:25,820;Stinks.
266;00:21:26,769;00:21:28,652;Stinks like death.
267;00:21:29,360;00:21:32,042;Don't think I can't smell it.
268;00:21:35,302;00:21:38,167;Pay the bastard back, Ned.
269;00:21:38,480;00:21:41,056;I drove my knife
269;00:21:38,480;00:21:41,056;right through his brain
270;00:21:41,057;00:21:43,317;You ask him if I didn't. Ask him!
271;00:21:44,886;00:21:49,886;I want the funeral feast to be the biggest
271;00:21:44,886;00:21:49,886;the kingdom ever saw..
272;00:21:50,953;00:21:54,741;And I want everyone
272;00:21:50,953;00:21:54,741;to taste the boar that got me
273;00:21:58,166;00:22:01,594;Now leave us, the lot of you
273;00:21:58,166;00:22:01,594;I need to talk to Ned.
274;00:22:02,329;00:22:05,291;Robert, my sweet...
274;00:22:02,329;00:22:05,291;Out! All of you!
275;00:22:24,972;00:22:26,783;You damn fool.
276;00:22:27,363;00:22:29,400;Paper and ink. On the table.
277;00:22:29,701;00:22:31,301;Write down what I said.

279;00:22:43,520;00:22:48,520;Put in the damn titles..
280;00:22:49,436;00:22:50,927;I hereby command..

286;00:23:44,002;00:23:45,567;Give it to the council..
287;00:23:46,068;00:23:47,568;after I'm death.
288;00:23:49,175;00:23:53,729;At least they'll say I did this right, this one thing.
289;00:23:53,926;00:23:55,812;You'll rule now.
290;00:23:56,962;00:23:59,425;You'll hate it worse than I did..
291;00:24:00,365;00:24:01,810;but you'll do it well.
292;00:24:06,297;00:24:07,535;The girl..

298;00:24:28,152;00:24:29,603;Let her live
299;00:24:31,404;00:24:34,604;Stop it if its not to late.
299;00:24:31,404;00:24:34,604;I will.
300;00:24:35,638;00:24:36,910;My son...
301;00:24:38,511;00:24:40,111;help him, Ned.
302;00:24:41,547;00:24:43,459;Make him better than me
303;00:24:44,509;00:24:45,619;I'll...
304;00:24:47,482;00:24:50,450;I'll do everything I can
304;00:24:47,482;00:24:50,450;to honor your memory.
305;00:24:50,530;00:24:52,216;My memory?
306;00:24:55,449;00:24:58,087;King Robert Baratheon...
307;00:24:58,988;00:25:01,388;murdered by a pig.
308;00:25:04,963;00:25:08,312;Give me something to the pain,
308;00:25:04,963;00:25:08,312;and let me die.
309;00:25:23,074;00:25:24,948;Give him milk of the poppy.
310;00:25:33,168;00:25:35,861;He was reeling from the wine..
311;00:25:37,147;00:25:38,525;He commanded us to...
312;00:25:38,926;00:25:40,626;step aside, but...
313;00:25:41,973;00:25:43,383;I failed him.
314;00:25:46,074;00:25:49,026;No men could've protected him from himself.
315;00:25:50,674;00:25:55,801;I wonder, Ser Barristan,
315;00:25:50,674;00:25:55,801;who gave the King this wine?
316;00:25:56,736;00:25:59,611;His squire.
316;00:25:56,736;00:25:59,611;From the King's own skin.
317;00:25:59,696;00:26:02,625;His squire? The Lannister boy?
318;00:26:02,947;00:26:07,466;Such a dutiful boy to make sure
318;00:26:02,947;00:26:07,466;His Grace did not lack refreshment.
319;00:26:08,148;00:26:11,584;I do hope the poor lad
319;00:26:08,148;00:26:11,584;is not blame himself.
320;00:26:19,575;00:26:23,997;His Grace has had a change of heart
320;00:26:19,575;00:26:23,997;concerning Daenerys Targaryen.
321;00:26:25,450;00:26:28,387;Whatever arrangements you made...
322;00:26:29,231;00:26:32,418;unmade them, at once.
323;00:26:32,505;00:26:35,810;I'm afraid those birds have flown.
324;00:26:36,024;00:26:38,419;The Khaleesi likely dead already.
325;00:28:19,123;00:28:21,351;Can you help me make him.. understand?
326;00:28:21,445;00:28:24,186;The Dothraki do things on their own time
326;00:28:21,445;00:28:24,186;for their own reason
327;00:28:24,201;00:28:27,809;Have patience, Khaleesi. We will
327;00:28:24,201;00:28:27,809;go home, I promise you.
328;00:28:27,860;00:28:29,111;My brother...
329;00:28:29,312;00:28:33,312;was a fool, I know.. but he was
329;00:28:29,312;00:28:33,312;the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms.
330;00:28:34,672;00:28:36,292;Have I said something funny, ser?
331;00:28:36,327;00:28:39,316;Forgive me, khaleesi, but your ancestor,
331;00:28:36,327;00:28:39,316;Aegon The Conqueror,
332;00:28:39,317;00:28:42,048;didn't seize six of the kingdoms
332;00:28:39,317;00:28:42,048;because it his right.
333;00:28:42,083;00:28:44,780;He have no right to them,
333;00:28:42,083;00:28:44,780;he seized them because he could.
334;00:28:44,892;00:28:46,588;And because he had dragons.
335;00:28:46,893;00:28:49,495;Having few dragons makes things easier.
336;00:28:50,333;00:28:53,822;You don't believe it?
336;00:28:50,333;00:28:53,822;Have you ever seen a dragon, khaleesi?
337;00:28:54,256;00:28:57,008;I believe what my eyes and ears report.
338;00:28:57,307;00:29:01,556;As for the rest, it was 300 years ago,
338;00:28:57,307;00:29:01,556;who knows what really happened.
339;00:29:01,616;00:29:03,965;Now if you pardon me,
339;00:29:01,616;00:29:03,965;I'll seek out the merchant captain..
340;00:29:03,966;00:29:06,966;see if he has any letter for me.
340;00:29:03,966;00:29:06,966;Well, I'll come with you.
341;00:29:06,984;00:29:08,692;No, no, don't trouble yourself.
342;00:29:08,788;00:29:12,029;Enjoy the market.
342;00:29:08,788;00:29:12,029;I'll rejoin you soon enough.
343;00:29:20,714;00:29:22,441;Jorah, the Andal?
344;00:29:24,653;00:29:28,552;The Spider sent his greetings
344;00:29:24,653;00:29:28,552;and his congratulations.
345;00:29:31,129;00:29:32,665;Overall pardon,
346;00:29:32,918;00:29:34,517;you can go home now.
347;00:30:14,564;00:30:18,953;My son already has his name, but I'll
347;00:30:14,564;00:30:18,953;try your summer wine. Just a taste.
348;00:30:19,875;00:30:22,160;My lady, you are from Westeros?
349;00:30:22,315;00:30:25,976;You have the honor of addressing
349;00:30:22,315;00:30:25,976;Daenerys of the House Targaryen.
350;00:30:26,090;00:30:30,086;Khaleesi of the riding men,
350;00:30:26,090;00:30:30,086;and princess of the Seven Kingdoms.
351;00:30:30,576;00:30:32,599;Princess.
351;00:30:30,576;00:30:32,599;Rise.
352;00:30:33,188;00:30:35,076;I still like to taste that wine.
353;00:30:35,654;00:30:36,713;That?
354;00:30:37,314;00:30:40,714;Dorne's sweet not worthy of a princess.
355;00:30:40,828;00:30:43,115;I have the dry red from the Arbor.
356;00:30:43,305;00:30:44,850;Nectar of the Gods.
357;00:30:45,281;00:30:47,039;Let me give you a cask.
358;00:30:47,402;00:30:49,866;A gift!
358;00:30:47,402;00:30:49,866;You honor me, ser.
359;00:30:49,877;00:30:52,329;The honor.. the honor is all mine.
360;00:30:57,592;00:30:59,296;You know there are many in your homeland
361;00:30:59,297;00:31:00,954;that pray for your return, princess.
362;00:31:00,989;00:31:02,952;I hope to repay your kindness someday.
364;00:31:12,960;00:31:15,231;The wine is for the Khaleesi,
364;00:31:12,960;00:31:15,231;it's not for the likes of you.
365;00:31:15,278;00:31:16,338;Open it.
366;00:31:28,162;00:31:29,161;Pour.
367;00:31:30,055;00:31:33,462;It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich
367;00:31:30,055;00:31:33,462;without at least giving it time to breathe.
368;00:31:33,464;00:31:34,851;Do as he says.
369;00:31:36,254;00:31:37,953;As the princess command.
370;00:31:50,272;00:31:51,765;Sweet, isn't it?
371;00:31:52,815;00:31:54,572;Can you smell the fruit, ser?
372;00:31:55,811;00:31:57,314;Taste it, my lord.
373;00:31:57,902;00:32:01,585;Tell me that is not the finest wine
373;00:31:57,902;00:32:01,585;that has ever touch your tongue.
374;00:32:04,939;00:32:06,205;You first.
375;00:32:08,844;00:32:09,953;Me?
376;00:32:10,580;00:32:13,002;I'm afraid I'm not worthy of the vintage.
377;00:32:13,052;00:32:16,099;Beside, is it a poor wine merchant
377;00:32:13,052;00:32:16,099;who drink up his own wares
378;00:32:16,148;00:32:18,639;You will drink.
379;00:32:50,687;00:32:51,727;Come.
380;00:32:58,964;00:33:01,860;You came to us as outlaws..
381;00:33:02,138;00:33:03,563;poachers..
382;00:33:04,175;00:33:05,198;rapers..
383;00:33:05,450;00:33:07,552;killers, thieves...
384;00:33:07,677;00:33:09,122;You came alone..
385;00:33:09,522;00:33:11,001;in chains..
386;00:33:11,501;00:33:14,584;without friends, or honor.
387;00:33:15,323;00:33:17,111;You came to us rich..
388;00:33:17,588;00:33:19,178;or you came to us poor.
389;00:33:19,673;00:33:23,748;Some of you bear the name
389;00:33:19,673;00:33:23,748;of proud houses..
390;00:33:24,299;00:33:27,290;all those only bastard names,
390;00:33:24,299;00:33:27,290;or no names at all.
391;00:33:27,389;00:33:32,525;It does not matter.
391;00:33:27,389;00:33:32,525;All that, is in the past.
392;00:33:33,045;00:33:34,129;Here..
393;00:33:35,113;00:33:36,577;on the Wall.
394;00:33:37,413;00:33:39,777;we're all one house.
395;00:33:40,949;00:33:42,095;Tonight..
396;00:33:42,806;00:33:44,977;We're allowed to look happy..
397;00:33:45,549;00:33:47,073;you're going to be a ranger.
398;00:33:48,363;00:33:50,372;It's not what you always wanted?
399;00:33:51,050;00:33:52,764;I want to find my uncle.
400;00:33:53,886;00:33:57,187;I know he's alive out there.
400;00:33:53,886;00:33:57,187;I know he is.
401;00:33:58,426;00:34:01,613;I wish I could help you,
401;00:33:58,426;00:34:01,613;but I'm no ranger.
402;00:34:02,328;00:34:04,439;its the steward's life for me.
403;00:34:05,287;00:34:07,379;You're honored being a steward.
404;00:34:08,260;00:34:09,701;Not much, really.
405;00:34:10,085;00:34:11,627;But those food.

410;00:34:35,450;00:34:37,062;Not for King
411;00:34:37,492;00:34:38,671;or a Lord..
412;00:34:38,862;00:34:42,523;or the honor of this house or that house.
413;00:34:43,015;00:34:45,566;Not for gold, glory,..
414;00:34:45,702;00:34:47,528;or women's love.
415;00:34:48,446;00:34:49,848;But for the realm..
416;00:34:50,295;00:34:52,526;and all the people in it.

418;00:34:57,202;00:35:00,128;Think carefully before you say them.
419;00:35:00,794;00:35:02,915;The penalty for desertion..
420;00:35:03,676;00:35:05,038;is death.
421;00:35:10,710;00:35:12,690;You can take your vows here..
422;00:35:12,919;00:35:14,119;tonight..
423;00:35:14,703;00:35:15,794;at sunset.
424;00:35:17,097;00:35:19,665;Do any of you still keep the Old Gods?
425;00:35:21,733;00:35:23,238;I do, my lord.
426;00:35:23,642;00:35:27,085;Do you want to take your vows before the heart tree,
426;00:35:23,642;00:35:27,085;as your uncle did?
427;00:35:27,151;00:35:28,212;Yes, my lord.
428;00:35:28,322;00:35:31,270;You'll find the weirwoods,
428;00:35:28,322;00:35:31,270;a mile north of the Wall..
429;00:35:31,362;00:35:33,421;and your Old  Gods too, maybe.
430;00:35:35,173;00:35:36,302;My Lord?
431;00:35:37,172;00:35:38,387;Might I go as well?

435;00:35:45,404;00:35:48,104;as my father was
435;00:35:45,404;00:35:48,104;and his father before him.
436;00:35:48,214;00:35:51,840;Why would you forsake,

437;00:35:54,257;00:35:56,887;The Night's Watch is my house now.
438;00:35:56,894;00:35:59,574;The Seven have never answer my prayers..
439;00:36:00,020;00:36:02,061;perhaps the Old Gods will.
440;00:36:03,586;00:36:04,836;As you wish.

472;00:37:49,826;00:37:54,026;Lord Commander Mormont has requested you
472;00:37:49,826;00:37:54,026;for his personal steward.
473;00:37:55,670;00:37:57,151;Will I serve the Lord Commander's meal,
474;00:37:57,152;00:37:59,140;and fetch hot water for his bath?
475;00:37:59,175;00:38:00,173;Certainly.
476;00:38:00,374;00:38:02,874;And keep the fire burning in his chambers..
477;00:38:02,875;00:38:05,675;change his sheets

478;00:38:05,748;00:38:09,563;and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you.
479;00:38:12,591;00:38:14,124;You take me for a servant?
480;00:38:14,222;00:38:17,145;We took you for a man of the Night's Watch.
481;00:38:17,237;00:38:20,085;But perhaps we were wrong in that.
482;00:38:20,738;00:38:22,013;May I go?
483;00:38:22,360;00:38:23,714;As you wish.
484;00:38:29,436;00:38:31,746;Jon! Wait!
485;00:38:31,875;00:38:35,455;Don't you see what they're doing?
485;00:38:31,875;00:38:35,455;I see ser Alliser revenge thats all..
486;00:38:35,456;00:38:37,255;he wanted it and he got it.
487;00:38:37,289;00:38:39,519;Steward are nothing
487;00:38:37,289;00:38:39,519;but maid!
488;00:38:39,520;00:38:42,194;I'm a better swordman and rider than any of you!
489;00:38:42,293;00:38:43,650;It's not fair!
490;00:38:43,728;00:38:45,296;Fair?
491;00:38:45,813;00:38:47,908;I was singing for a high lord
491;00:38:45,813;00:38:47,908;at Acorn Hall,
492;00:38:47,909;00:38:50,822;when he put his hand in my leg
492;00:38:47,909;00:38:50,822;and he wanted to see my cock.
493;00:38:50,902;00:38:52,393;I pushed him away and he said..
494;00:38:52,428;00:38:54,935;he'd have my hand cut off
494;00:38:52,428;00:38:54,935;for stealing when he's over.
495;00:38:54,936;00:38:56,875;So now I'm here,
495;00:38:54,936;00:38:56,875;at the end of the world,
496;00:38:56,876;00:38:59,825;where noone to sing a folk,
496;00:38:56,876;00:38:59,825;but old men and little shit like you.
497;00:38:59,826;00:39:01,753;I'll never see my family again.
498;00:39:01,754;00:39:05,198;I'll never been inside a women again.
498;00:39:01,754;00:39:05,198;Don't tell me about fair.
499;00:39:05,199;00:39:07,224;I thought you were caught stealing
499;00:39:05,199;00:39:07,224;a wheel of cheese..
500;00:39:07,225;00:39:09,112;for your starving sister.
501;00:39:09,147;00:39:11,200;Course who's gonna teel a bunch of strangers..
502;00:39:11,201;00:39:13,404;a high lord try to grab my cock?
503;00:39:15,754;00:39:17,744;Could you sing me a song, Pyp?
504;00:39:17,994;00:39:20,064;I'd like to hear a song.
505;00:39:24,584;00:39:25,864;Now listen to me..
506;00:39:26,323;00:39:29,617;the old man, is the Lord Commander
506;00:39:26,323;00:39:29,617;of The Night's Watch.
507;00:39:29,669;00:39:34,313;You will be with him, day and night,
507;00:39:29,669;00:39:34,313;yes.. you will clean his clothes.
508;00:39:34,314;00:39:36,670;You will also, take his letters..
509;00:39:36,671;00:39:39,944;attend him at meeting,
509;00:39:36,671;00:39:39,944;squire for him at battle.
510;00:39:40,134;00:39:43,503;You'll know everything,
510;00:39:40,134;00:39:43,503;be part of everything.
511;00:39:43,704;00:39:46,154;And he ask for you himself.
512;00:39:46,814;00:39:49,713;He wants to groom you for command.
513;00:39:54,893;00:39:55,990;I just...
514;00:39:57,306;00:39:59,513;I always wanted to be a ranger.
515;00:40:01,722;00:40:03,772;I always wanted to be a wizard.
516;00:40:07,093;00:40:08,383;What?
517;00:40:08,742;00:40:10,252;No, I'm serious.
518;00:40:10,253;00:40:13,063;So you'll stay and say your word with me?
519;00:40:19,513;00:40:20,862;Lord Stark.
520;00:40:21,412;00:40:22,752;A moment?
521;00:40:23,902;00:40:25,542;Alone, if you will.
522;00:40:35,402;00:40:37,542;He name you Protector of The Realm.
523;00:40:39,182;00:40:40,362;He did.
524;00:40:40,881;00:40:42,342;She won't care.
525;00:40:42,422;00:40:45,382;Give me an hour and I'll put
525;00:40:42,422;00:40:45,382;a hundred of swords at your command.
526;00:40:46,152;00:40:49,411;And what should I do with a hundred swords?
526;00:40:46,152;00:40:49,411;Strike!
527;00:40:49,412;00:40:51,921;Tonight, while the castle sleeps.
528;00:40:52,112;00:40:55,391;We must get Joffrey away from his mother
528;00:40:52,112;00:40:55,391;and into our custody.
529;00:40:55,401;00:40:59,331;Protector of The Realm or no,
529;00:40:55,401;00:40:59,331;he who holds the king holds the kingdom.
530;00:41:00,322;00:41:03,620;Every moment you delay,
530;00:41:00,322;00:41:03,620;gives Cersei another moment to prepare.
531;00:41:03,621;00:41:06,513;By the time Robert die,
531;00:41:03,621;00:41:06,513;it would be late for the both of us.
532;00:41:06,548;00:41:08,161;What about Stannis?
533;00:41:08,221;00:41:12,111;Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei
533;00:41:08,221;00:41:12,111;and delivering him to Stannis?
534;00:41:12,331;00:41:14,700;You have odd notion about
534;00:41:12,331;00:41:14,700;protecting the realm.
535;00:41:14,701;00:41:16,370;Stannis is your older brother.
536;00:41:16,371;00:41:18,911;This isn't about the bloody line of succession.
537;00:41:18,971;00:41:20,874;That didn't matter when you rebelled
537;00:41:18,971;00:41:20,874;against the Mad King..
538;00:41:20,875;00:41:23,592;it shouldn't matter now.
539;00:41:24,696;00:41:26,726;What's the best for the kingdoms?
540;00:41:27,186;00:41:29,695;What's best for the people we rule?
541;00:41:30,836;00:41:33,146;We all know what Stannis is..
542;00:41:33,955;00:41:36,576;He inspires no love, or loyalty.
543;00:41:37,015;00:41:38,496;He's not a king.
544;00:41:40,026;00:41:41,395;I am.
545;00:41:48,235;00:41:50,025;Stannis is a commander.
546;00:41:50,965;00:41:53,334;He's led men into war, twice.
547;00:41:53,335;00:41:56,744;He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.
547;00:41:53,335;00:41:56,744;Yes. he's a good soldier, everyone knows that.
548;00:41:56,745;00:41:58,435;so is Robert.
549;00:41:59,334;00:42:03,345;Tell me something. Do you still believe
549;00:41:59,334;00:42:03,345;good soldier made good king?
550;00:42:08,905;00:42:12,675;I will not dishonor Robert's last hour
550;00:42:08,905;00:42:12,675;by shedding blood in his house..
551;00:42:13,345;00:42:16,214;and dragging frightened children,
551;00:42:13,345;00:42:16,214;from their beds.
552;00:42:29,664;00:42:32,064;You will sail to Dragonstone tonight.
553;00:42:32,284;00:42:35,114;You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon.
554;00:42:36,714;00:42:38,244;Not his steward.
555;00:42:39,554;00:42:41,504;Not his captain of the guard.
556;00:42:41,954;00:42:43,623;And not his wife.
557;00:42:49,413;00:42:51,394;Only Stannis himself.
558;00:42:52,813;00:42:54,153;Yes, my lord.
559;00:42:56,324;00:42:57,693;Now leave us.
560;00:43:07,353;00:43:09,183;My lord protector.
561;00:43:15,153;00:43:17,351;The king has no trueborn son.
562;00:43:17,898;00:43:21,813;Joffrey and Tommen, are Jaime Lannister's bastards.
563;00:43:22,702;00:43:27,075;So when the king dies..
563;00:43:22,702;00:43:27,075;The throne passes to his brother..
564;00:43:28,442;00:43:30,023;Lord Stannis.
565;00:43:31,003;00:43:32,783;So it would seem.
566;00:43:34,232;00:43:36,851;Unless..
566;00:43:34,232;00:43:36,851;There is no unless!
567;00:43:36,852;00:43:39,147;He is the rightful heir.
567;00:43:36,852;00:43:39,147;Nothing can change that.
568;00:43:39,182;00:43:41,412;And he cannot take the throne
568;00:43:39,182;00:43:41,412;without your help.
569;00:43:41,413;00:43:45,512;You would be wise to denied to him.
569;00:43:41,413;00:43:45,512;And to make sure Joffrey succeeds.
570;00:43:48,532;00:43:50,552;Do you have a shred of honor?
571;00:43:51,122;00:43:54,615;You're now Hand of The King
571;00:43:51,122;00:43:54,615;and Protector of The Realm,
572;00:43:54,616;00:44:00,232;all the power is yours, you need only..
572;00:43:54,616;00:44:00,232;reach out and take it.
573;00:44:00,362;00:44:03,571;Make peace with the Lannisters.
573;00:44:00,362;00:44:03,571;Release The Imp.
574;00:44:03,772;00:44:05,911;Wed your daughter to Joffrey.
575;00:44:06,151;00:44:08,195;We've plenty of time
575;00:44:06,151;00:44:08,195;to get rid of Stannis..
576;00:44:08,230;00:44:11,805;and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems
576;00:44:08,230;00:44:11,805;when he come into his throne..
577;00:44:11,806;00:44:14,319;we simply reveal his little secret..
578;00:44:14,320;00:44:17,216;and sit Lord Renly there instead.
578;00:44:14,320;00:44:17,216;We?
579;00:44:17,386;00:44:21,251;You'll need someone to share this burdens,
579;00:44:17,386;00:44:21,251;I assure you..
580;00:44:21,460;00:44:23,901;my price would be modest.
581;00:44:24,320;00:44:26,911;Would you suggest this treason?
582;00:44:27,480;00:44:29,260;Only if we lose.
583;00:44:31,460;00:44:34,040;Make peace with the Lannisters you say..
584;00:44:35,751;00:44:38,068;The people who tried to murder my boy.
585;00:44:38,103;00:44:43,861;We only make peace with our enemy, my lord.
585;00:44:38,103;00:44:43,861;That's why its called making peace.
586;00:44:44,110;00:44:45,330;No...
587;00:44:46,300;00:44:47,530;I won't do it.
588;00:44:47,860;00:44:51,880;So it will be Stannis? and war?
588;00:44:47,860;00:44:51,880;There is no other choice.
589;00:44:52,970;00:44:54,470;He is the heir.
590;00:44:55,530;00:44:59,370;So why did you call me here?
590;00:44:55,530;00:44:59,370;Not for my wisdom clearly.
591;00:45:00,730;00:45:03,000;You promised Catelyn
591;00:45:00,730;00:45:03,000;you would help me.
592;00:45:03,159;00:45:06,109;The queen had a dozen knights
592;00:45:03,159;00:45:06,109;and hundred man-at-arms.
593;00:45:06,110;00:45:09,650;Enough to overwhelm what remain
593;00:45:06,110;00:45:09,650;of my household guard.
594;00:45:09,930;00:45:12,439;I need the Gold Cloaks.
595;00:45:12,769;00:45:15,330;The City Watch is two thousand strong.
596;00:45:15,759;00:45:18,319;and sworn to defend the king's peace.
597;00:45:21,270;00:45:22,719;Look at you.
598;00:45:23,769;00:45:27,839;You know what you want me to do.
598;00:45:23,769;00:45:27,839;You know it has to be done.
599;00:45:28,149;00:45:30,449;But it's not honorable, so...
600;00:45:30,939;00:45:33,159;the words stick in your throat.
601;00:45:33,639;00:45:37,702;When the Queen proclaims one king,
601;00:45:33,639;00:45:37,702;and the Hand proclaim another..
602;00:45:37,703;00:45:41,009;who's peace to the Gold Cloaks protect?
603;00:45:42,299;00:45:44,168;Who do they follow?
604;00:45:49,099;00:45:51,039;The man who pays them.
605;00:46:36,388;00:46:40,758;Hear my words,
605;00:46:36,388;00:46:40,758;and bear witness to my vow

607;00:46:44,478;00:46:47,326;It shall not end until my death.
608;00:46:47,688;00:46:53,357;I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.

610;00:46:57,587;00:47:00,934;I shall live and die at my post.
611;00:47:01,077;00:47:03,730;I am the sword in the darkness.
612;00:47:04,216;00:47:06,637;I am the watcher on the walls.
613;00:47:06,946;00:47:10,593;I am the shield that guards the realm of men.
614;00:47:10,986;00:47:15,134;I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch,
615;00:47:15,135;00:47:18,635;for this night and all the nights to come.
616;00:47:18,945;00:47:20,876;You knelt as boys..

617;00:47:21,145;00:47:23,955;of the Night's Watch.

619;00:47:46,530;00:47:47,541;What he's got there?
620;00:47:47,778;00:47:49,089;To me, Ghost.
621;00:47:49,370;00:47:50,850;Bring it here.
622;00:47:52,660;00:47:54,499;Gods be good.
623;00:48:01,732;00:48:03,202;What will they do to him?
624;00:48:06,832;00:48:08,141;When the khalasar rides..
625;00:48:08,176;00:48:12,635;he'll be leashed to the saddle and forced
625;00:48:08,176;00:48:12,635;to run behind the horses, as long as he can.
626;00:48:13,037;00:48:14,492;And when he falls?
627;00:48:16,142;00:48:18,892;I saw a man last nine miles once.
628;00:48:20,642;00:48:22,583;King Robert still wants me dead.
629;00:48:22,618;00:48:25,602;This poisoner was the first,
629;00:48:22,618;00:48:25,602;he won't be the last.
630;00:48:25,722;00:48:29,221;I thought he'd leave me alone,
630;00:48:25,722;00:48:29,221;now that my brother is gone.
631;00:48:29,222;00:48:31,561;He will never leave you alone.
632;00:48:32,272;00:48:35,521;If you ride to Asshai,
632;00:48:32,272;00:48:35,521;his assassins will follow you.
633;00:48:35,522;00:48:39,311;If you sail all the way to the Basilisk Isle,
633;00:48:35,522;00:48:39,311;his spy would tell him.
634;00:48:39,312;00:48:42,071;He will never abandon the hunt.
635;00:48:42,912;00:48:44,711;You are Targaryen.
636;00:48:44,882;00:48:46,660;The last Targaryen.
637;00:48:46,661;00:48:49,065;Your son will have Targaryen blood..
638;00:48:49,066;00:48:51,421;with 40.000 riders behind him.
639;00:48:52,741;00:48:54,491;He will not have my son.
640;00:48:55,721;00:48:57,921;He will not have you either, khaleesi.
641;00:52:00,373;00:52:01,743;Lord Stark!

650;00:52:35,507;00:52:39,057;I fear Lord Renly
650;00:52:35,507;00:52:39,057;has left the city.
651;00:52:39,387;00:52:42,550;He rode through the Old Gate
