1;00:00:07,053;00:00:08,810;Come and get her.
2;00:00:16,588;00:00:20,128;It's an invitation...
2;00:00:16,588;00:00:20,128;to King's Landing.
3;00:00:20,129;00:00:21,628;You will represent my interests
4;00:00:21,629;00:00:23,253;at this gathering
4;00:00:21,629;00:00:23,253;as you see them.
5;00:00:23,254;00:00:25,713;It's not safe leaving you
5;00:00:23,254;00:00:25,713;with Littlefinger.
6;00:00:25,920;00:00:27,421;She's your sister.
7;00:00:27,796;00:00:29,212;Arya would never betray
7;00:00:27,796;00:00:29,212;her family.
8;00:00:29,421;00:00:31,941;She would if she
8;00:00:29,421;00:00:31,941;thought I was going to betray Jon.
9;00:00:35,045;00:00:37,129;With the faces,
9;00:00:35,045;00:00:37,129;I can become someone else.
10;00:00:37,713;00:00:41,713;I wonder what it would feel like
10;00:00:37,713;00:00:41,713;to be the Lady of Winterfell.
11;00:00:42,379;00:00:47,588;All I'd need to find out...
11;00:00:42,379;00:00:47,588;is your face.
12;00:00:51,045;00:00:52,545;Daenerys will win this war.
13;00:00:52,546;00:00:54,003;If you want Cersei
13;00:00:52,546;00:00:54,003;to bend the knee,
14;00:00:54,004;00:00:55,004;you can ask her yourself.
15;00:00:55,005;00:00:57,045;She has
15;00:00:55,005;00:00:57,045;a more important request.
16;00:00:57,920;00:00:59,587;Cersei thinks the army
16;00:00:57,920;00:00:59,587;of the dead is nothing
17;00:00:59,588;00:01:01,879;but a story.
17;00:00:59,588;00:01:01,879;What if we prove her wrong?
18;00:01:02,421;00:01:04,044;Bring the dead to her.
19;00:01:10,462;00:01:11,462;Go!
20;00:01:17,421;00:01:19,920;We are going to destroy
20;00:01:17,421;00:01:19,920;the Night King and his army.
21;00:01:20,504;00:01:22,254;Thank you, my queen.
22;00:04:21,254;00:04:23,461;Oil?
22;00:04:21,254;00:04:23,461;Pitch, my lord.
23;00:04:23,462;00:04:26,004;How many barrels?
23;00:04:23,462;00:04:26,004;500, my lord.
24;00:04:28,671;00:04:30,086;Get 500 more.
25;00:04:30,087;00:04:31,087;Yes, my lord.
26;00:04:43,546;00:04:46,503;I still enjoy it
26;00:04:43,546;00:04:46,503;when they call me my lord.
27;00:04:46,504;00:04:48,961;The thrill will fade.
28;00:04:48,962;00:04:50,462;If we live that long.
29;00:04:51,962;00:04:53,670;Men without cocks.
30;00:04:53,671;00:04:55,378;You wouldn't find me
30;00:04:53,671;00:04:55,378;fighting in an army
31;00:04:55,379;00:04:57,336;if I had no cock.
32;00:04:57,337;00:04:59,795;What's left
32;00:04:57,337;00:04:59,795;to fight for?
33;00:04:59,796;00:05:01,670;Gold?
34;00:05:01,671;00:05:03,503;I spent my life
34;00:05:01,671;00:05:03,503;around soldiers.
35;00:05:03,504;00:05:05,629;What do you think
35;00:05:03,504;00:05:05,629;they spend that gold on?
36;00:05:07,170;00:05:08,837;Family.
37;00:05:08,838;00:05:10,504;Not without a cock,
37;00:05:08,838;00:05:10,504;you don't.
38;00:05:11,879;00:05:14,671;Maybe it really is
38;00:05:11,879;00:05:14,671;all cocks in the end.
39;00:05:16,754;00:05:20,044;Yet, your brother has chosen
39;00:05:16,754;00:05:20,044;to side with the cockless.
40;00:05:20,045;00:05:24,919;Yes, he's always been
40;00:05:20,045;00:05:24,919;a champion of the downtrodden.
41;00:06:03,129;00:06:05,879;I think we're about to be
41;00:06:03,129;00:06:05,879;the downtrodden.
42;00:06:07,838;00:06:10,295;Archers, stand tall!
43;00:06:10,296;00:06:13,254;Cover that wall!
44;00:06:40,713;00:06:44,295;How many people live here?
44;00:06:40,713;00:06:44,295;A million, give or take.
45;00:06:44,296;00:06:48,420;That's more people than the
45;00:06:44,296;00:06:48,420;entire North crammed into that.
46;00:06:48,421;00:06:50,587;Why would anyone
46;00:06:48,421;00:06:50,587;want to live that way?
47;00:06:50,588;00:06:53,044;There's more work
47;00:06:50,588;00:06:53,044;in the city.
48;00:06:53,045;00:06:55,254;And the brothels
48;00:06:53,045;00:06:55,254;are far superior.
49;00:07:33,588;00:07:35,628;Why isn't she with them?
50;00:07:35,629;00:07:37,795;I'm afraid I don't know,
50;00:07:35,629;00:07:37,795;Your Grace.
51;00:07:37,796;00:07:39,961;No one has seen her.
52;00:07:39,962;00:07:41,628;And the rest of them?
53;00:07:41,629;00:07:43,878;They're on their way
53;00:07:41,629;00:07:43,878;to the Dragonpit now.
54;00:07:43,879;00:07:45,170;Including our brother?
55;00:07:46,838;00:07:47,962;Yes, Your Grace.
56;00:07:52,296;00:07:53,795;If anything goes wrong,
57;00:07:53,796;00:07:55,837;kill the silver-haired
57;00:07:53,796;00:07:55,837;bitch first,
58;00:07:55,838;00:07:59,128;then our brother, then the
58;00:07:55,838;00:07:59,128;bastard who calls himself king.
59;00:07:59,129;00:08:02,170;The rest of them you can kill
59;00:07:59,129;00:08:02,170;in any order you see fit.
60;00:08:03,588;00:08:04,961;Come, Ser Gregor.
61;00:08:04,962;00:08:07,129;It's time for us
61;00:08:04,962;00:08:07,129;to meet our guests.
62;00:08:15,879;00:08:18,044;Why did they build it?
63;00:08:18,045;00:08:19,670;Dragons don't understand
63;00:08:18,045;00:08:19,670;the difference
64;00:08:19,671;00:08:21,878;between what is theirs
64;00:08:19,671;00:08:21,878;and what isn't.
65;00:08:21,879;00:08:25,545;Land, livestock,
65;00:08:21,879;00:08:25,545;children...
66;00:08:25,546;00:08:28,086;Letting them roam free
66;00:08:25,546;00:08:28,086;around a city was a problem.
67;00:08:28,087;00:08:31,878;I imagine it was
67;00:08:28,087;00:08:31,878;a sad joke at the end.
68;00:08:31,879;00:08:35,336;An entire arena for a few sickly
68;00:08:31,879;00:08:35,336;creatures smaller than dogs.
69;00:08:35,337;00:08:38,837;But in the beginning, when it
69;00:08:35,337;00:08:38,837;was home to Balerion the Dread,
70;00:08:38,838;00:08:42,212;it must have been the most
70;00:08:38,838;00:08:42,212;dangerous place in the world.
71;00:08:47,879;00:08:50,546;Maybe it still is.
72;00:08:59,004;00:09:00,546;Welcome, my lords.
73;00:09:03,629;00:09:06,587;Your friends arrived
73;00:09:03,629;00:09:06,587;before you did.
74;00:09:06,588;00:09:09,462;I've been sent to escort
74;00:09:06,588;00:09:09,462;you all to the meeting.
75;00:09:32,920;00:09:35,919;A pleasant surprise
75;00:09:32,920;00:09:35,919;in an unpleasant situation.
76;00:09:35,920;00:09:38,587;I never thought I'd see
76;00:09:35,920;00:09:38,587;you again, my lord.
77;00:09:38,588;00:09:40,128;Supporting the enemy,
77;00:09:38,588;00:09:40,128;no less.
78;00:09:40,129;00:09:42,879;Hard to blame you.
78;00:09:40,129;00:09:42,879;Cersei will anyway.
79;00:09:44,170;00:09:45,587;I'm glad you're alive.
80;00:09:45,588;00:09:46,837;Come on!
81;00:09:46,838;00:09:48,296;You can suck
81;00:09:46,838;00:09:48,296;his magic cock later.
82;00:09:55,962;00:09:57,337;What's in there?
83;00:09:58,671;00:10:00,129;Fuck off.
84;00:10:09,796;00:10:11,461;I thought
84;00:10:09,796;00:10:11,461;you were dead.
85;00:10:11,462;00:10:13,628;Not yet.
86;00:10:13,629;00:10:15,962;You came pretty close.
87;00:10:17,296;00:10:19,920;I was only trying
87;00:10:17,296;00:10:19,920;to protect her.
88;00:10:21,337;00:10:23,211;You and me both.
89;00:10:23,212;00:10:25,128;She's alive.
90;00:10:25,129;00:10:26,296;Arya.
91;00:10:28,629;00:10:31,170;Where?
91;00:10:28,629;00:10:31,170;Winterfell.
92;00:10:33,170;00:10:36,169;Who's protecting her
92;00:10:33,170;00:10:36,169;if you're here?
93;00:10:36,170;00:10:37,670;The only one
93;00:10:36,170;00:10:37,670;that needs protecting
94;00:10:37,671;00:10:40,004;is the one that gets
94;00:10:37,671;00:10:40,004;in her way.
95;00:10:42,879;00:10:44,546;It won't be me.
96;00:10:47,671;00:10:49,753;Here we are...
97;00:10:49,754;00:10:52,295;the heroes of Blackwater Bay.
98;00:10:52,296;00:10:53,878;Strange place for a reunion.
99;00:10:53,879;00:10:55,753;It is, my lord.
100;00:10:55,754;00:10:58,837;I don't think I'm anyone's
100;00:10:55,754;00:10:58,837;lord anymore, Podrick.
101;00:10:58,838;00:11:01,420;Save the titles for
101;00:10:58,838;00:11:01,420;Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
102;00:11:01,421;00:11:04,336;I'm sure your new queen will
102;00:11:01,421;00:11:04,336;be happy to restore yours
103;00:11:04,337;00:11:05,795;if she ends up
103;00:11:04,337;00:11:05,795;on the throne.
104;00:11:05,796;00:11:07,919;You've been thinking
104;00:11:05,796;00:11:07,919;about our new queen?
105;00:11:07,920;00:11:12,253;Perhaps you've been
105;00:11:07,920;00:11:12,253;reconsidering your allegiances.
106;00:11:12,254;00:11:14,295;Remember my offer...
107;00:11:14,296;00:11:17,712;whatever they're paying you,
107;00:11:14,296;00:11:17,712;I'll pay double.
108;00:11:17,713;00:11:20,253;And that would be
108;00:11:17,713;00:11:20,253;double what now, exactly?
109;00:11:20,254;00:11:22,795;Don't you worry about me.
109;00:11:20,254;00:11:22,795;I'm doing all right.
110;00:11:22,796;00:11:25,128;Looking after myself.
110;00:11:22,796;00:11:25,128;Are you?
111;00:11:25,129;00:11:26,587;Helping me to arrange
111;00:11:25,129;00:11:26,587;this meeting
112;00:11:26,588;00:11:29,044;wasn't exactly looking
112;00:11:26,588;00:11:29,044;after yourself, was it?
113;00:11:29,045;00:11:30,837;You put yourself
113;00:11:29,045;00:11:30,837;at risk.
114;00:11:30,838;00:11:33,712;I put yourself at risk.
114;00:11:30,838;00:11:33,712;Important difference.
115;00:11:33,713;00:11:37,211;It's your head Queen Cersei's offered
115;00:11:33,713;00:11:37,211;a bag of gold for, it's not mine.
116;00:11:37,212;00:11:39,003;Now, thanks to me,
117;00:11:39,004;00:11:42,211;she's got two traitors' heads
117;00:11:39,004;00:11:42,211;coming right through her door.
118;00:11:42,212;00:11:44,670;She can lop them both off
118;00:11:42,212;00:11:44,670;as soon as she gets tired
119;00:11:44,671;00:11:47,545;of the clever words that
119;00:11:44,671;00:11:47,545;pour out their pieholes.
120;00:11:47,546;00:11:50,753;All thanks to Ser Bronn
120;00:11:47,546;00:11:50,753;of the fucking Blackwater.
121;00:11:50,754;00:11:54,045;If that's not looking after
121;00:11:50,754;00:11:54,045;myself, I don't know what is.
122;00:11:55,754;00:11:57,087;It's good
122;00:11:55,754;00:11:57,087;to see you again.
123;00:12:00,045;00:12:01,546;Yeah, you, too.
124;00:12:10,421;00:12:14,254;Anyone touches it,
124;00:12:10,421;00:12:14,254;I'll kill you first.
125;00:13:12,504;00:13:13,919;Come on, Pod.
126;00:13:13,920;00:13:15,420;Let's you and me
126;00:13:13,920;00:13:15,420;go have a drink
127;00:13:15,421;00:13:16,962;while the fancy folks
127;00:13:15,421;00:13:16,962;talk, eh?
128;00:13:46,170;00:13:48,003;I left this shit city
129;00:13:48,004;00:13:50,837;because I didn't
129;00:13:48,004;00:13:50,837;want to die in it.
130;00:13:50,838;00:13:53,129;Am I going to die
130;00:13:50,838;00:13:53,129;in this shit city?
131;00:13:54,212;00:13:55,295;You might.
132;00:13:55,296;00:13:58,712;And this is all
132;00:13:55,296;00:13:58,712;your idea.
133;00:13:58,713;00:14:02,044;Seems every bad idea has some
133;00:13:58,713;00:14:02,044;Lannister cunt behind it.
134;00:14:02,045;00:14:05,211;And some Clegane cunt
134;00:14:02,045;00:14:05,211;to help them see it through.
135;00:15:05,004;00:15:06,919;Remember me?
136;00:15:06,920;00:15:08,837;Yeah, you do.
137;00:15:08,838;00:15:12,919;You're even fucking
137;00:15:08,838;00:15:12,919;uglier than I am now.
138;00:15:12,920;00:15:15,421;What did they do
138;00:15:12,920;00:15:15,421;to you?
139;00:15:16,713;00:15:18,753;Doesn't matter.
140;00:15:18,754;00:15:20,961;That's not how it ends
140;00:15:18,754;00:15:20,961;for you, brother.
141;00:15:20,962;00:15:24,211;You know who's
141;00:15:20,962;00:15:24,211;coming for you.
142;00:15:24,212;00:15:26,296;You've always known.
143;00:15:40,838;00:15:41,838;Where is she?
144;00:15:43,254;00:15:44,378;She'll be here soon.
145;00:15:44,379;00:15:45,629;Didn't travel with you?
146;00:15:47,504;00:15:48,504;No.
147;00:17:43,421;00:17:45,420;We've been here
147;00:17:43,421;00:17:45,420;for some time.
148;00:17:45,421;00:17:47,713;My apologies.
149;00:17:57,004;00:17:58,670;We are all facing a unique...
150;00:17:58,671;00:18:00,712;Theon!
151;00:18:00,713;00:18:02,628;I have your sister.
152;00:18:02,629;00:18:05,045;If you don't submit
152;00:18:02,629;00:18:05,045;to me here, now...
153;00:18:06,462;00:18:07,838;I'll kill her.
154;00:18:13,588;00:18:16,044;I think we ought to begin
154;00:18:13,588;00:18:16,044;with larger concerns.
155;00:18:16,045;00:18:18,253;Then why
155;00:18:16,045;00:18:18,253;are you talking?
156;00:18:18,254;00:18:20,462;You're the smallest
156;00:18:18,254;00:18:20,462;concern here.
157;00:18:22,087;00:18:24,712;Do you remember when we
157;00:18:22,087;00:18:24,712;discussed dwarf jokes?
158;00:18:24,713;00:18:26,461;His wasn't even good.
159;00:18:26,462;00:18:27,795;He explained it
159;00:18:26,462;00:18:27,795;at the end.
160;00:18:27,796;00:18:29,336;Never explain.
160;00:18:27,796;00:18:29,336;It always ruins it.
161;00:18:29,337;00:18:30,837;We don't even
161;00:18:29,337;00:18:30,837;let your kind live
162;00:18:30,838;00:18:34,044;in the Iron Islands,
162;00:18:30,838;00:18:34,044;you know?
163;00:18:34,045;00:18:36,253;We kill you at birth.
164;00:18:36,254;00:18:38,295;An act of mercy
164;00:18:36,254;00:18:38,295;for the parents.
165;00:18:38,296;00:18:40,961;Perhaps you ought
165;00:18:38,296;00:18:40,961;to sit down.
166;00:18:40,962;00:18:42,420;Why?
167;00:18:42,421;00:18:44,629;Sit down or leave.
168;00:19:03,379;00:19:08,837;We are a group of people
168;00:19:03,379;00:19:08,837;who do not like one another,
169;00:19:08,838;00:19:11,379;as this recent
169;00:19:08,838;00:19:11,379;demonstration has shown.
170;00:19:12,879;00:19:15,169;We have suffered
170;00:19:12,879;00:19:15,169;at each other's hands.
171;00:19:15,170;00:19:18,545;We have lost people we love
171;00:19:15,170;00:19:18,545;at each other's hands.
172;00:19:18,546;00:19:20,837;If all we wanted
172;00:19:18,546;00:19:20,837;was more of the same,
173;00:19:20,838;00:19:23,086;there would be no need
173;00:19:20,838;00:19:23,086;for this gathering.
174;00:19:23,087;00:19:26,128;We are entirely capable of
174;00:19:23,087;00:19:26,128;waging war against each other
175;00:19:26,129;00:19:27,837;without meeting
175;00:19:26,129;00:19:27,837;face-to-face.
176;00:19:27,838;00:19:29,712;So instead, we should
176;00:19:27,838;00:19:29,712;settle our differences
177;00:19:29,713;00:19:32,378;and live together in harmony
177;00:19:29,713;00:19:32,378;for the rest of our days?
178;00:19:32,379;00:19:33,795;We all know
178;00:19:32,379;00:19:33,795;that will never happen.
179;00:19:33,796;00:19:35,170;Then why are we here?
180;00:19:37,504;00:19:40,546;This isn't about
180;00:19:37,504;00:19:40,546;living in harmony.
181;00:19:42,045;00:19:43,837;It's just
181;00:19:42,045;00:19:43,837;about living.
182;00:19:43,838;00:19:46,420;The same thing
182;00:19:43,838;00:19:46,420;is coming for all of us.
183;00:19:46,421;00:19:48,461;A general you can't
183;00:19:46,421;00:19:48,461;negotiate with.
184;00:19:48,462;00:19:52,211;An army that doesn't leave corpses
184;00:19:48,462;00:19:52,211;behind on the battlefield.
185;00:19:52,212;00:19:55,795;Lord Tyrion tells me a million
185;00:19:52,212;00:19:55,795;people live in this city.
186;00:19:55,796;00:19:59,211;They're about to become a million more
186;00:19:55,796;00:19:59,211;soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
187;00:19:59,212;00:20:01,920;I imagine for most of them
187;00:19:59,212;00:20:01,920;it would be an improvement.
188;00:20:06,087;00:20:07,504;This is serious.
189;00:20:08,962;00:20:10,670;I wouldn't be here
189;00:20:08,962;00:20:10,670;if it weren't.
190;00:20:10,671;00:20:12,503;I don't think
190;00:20:10,671;00:20:12,503;it's serious at all.
191;00:20:12,504;00:20:13,961;I think it's
191;00:20:12,504;00:20:13,961;another bad joke.
192;00:20:13,962;00:20:16,712;If my brother Jaime
192;00:20:13,962;00:20:16,712;has informed me correctly,
193;00:20:16,713;00:20:18,336;you're asking me
193;00:20:16,713;00:20:18,336;for a truce.
194;00:20:18,337;00:20:20,879;Yes.
194;00:20:18,337;00:20:20,879;That's all.
195;00:20:22,588;00:20:23,962;That's all?
196;00:20:25,337;00:20:26,919;Pull back my armies
196;00:20:25,337;00:20:26,919;and stand down
197;00:20:26,920;00:20:28,628;while you go
197;00:20:26,920;00:20:28,628;on your monster hunt.
198;00:20:28,629;00:20:31,211;Or while you solidify
198;00:20:28,629;00:20:31,211;and expand your position.
199;00:20:31,212;00:20:35,587;Hard for me to know which it
199;00:20:31,212;00:20:35,587;is with my armies pulled back
200;00:20:35,588;00:20:39,253;until you return and march on my
200;00:20:35,588;00:20:39,253;capital with four times the men.
201;00:20:39,254;00:20:43,588;Your capital will be safe until the
201;00:20:39,254;00:20:43,588;northern threat is dealt with.
202;00:20:45,004;00:20:46,295;You have my word.
203;00:20:46,296;00:20:48,420;The word of
203;00:20:46,296;00:20:48,420;a would-be usurper.
204;00:20:48,421;00:20:50,420;There is no conversation
205;00:20:50,421;00:20:54,461;that will erase
205;00:20:50,421;00:20:54,461;the last 50 years.
206;00:20:54,462;00:20:56,671;We have something
206;00:20:54,462;00:20:56,671;to show you.
207;00:23:12,170;00:23:14,754;We can destroy them
207;00:23:12,170;00:23:14,754;by burning them.
208;00:23:24,337;00:23:27,754;And we can destroy them
208;00:23:24,337;00:23:27,754;with dragonglass.
209;00:23:29,796;00:23:31,587;If we don't win
209;00:23:29,796;00:23:31,587;this fight,
210;00:23:31,588;00:23:35,588;then that is the fate
210;00:23:31,588;00:23:35,588;of every person in the world.
211;00:23:53,254;00:23:55,461;There is only one war
211;00:23:53,254;00:23:55,461;that matters...
212;00:23:55,462;00:23:57,796;the Great War.
213;00:23:58,920;00:24:00,296;And it is here.
214;00:24:04,504;00:24:06,629;I didn't believe
214;00:24:04,504;00:24:06,629;it until I saw them.
215;00:24:08,920;00:24:10,296;I saw them all.
216;00:24:13,004;00:24:14,211;How many?
217;00:24:14,212;00:24:15,629;A hundred thousand,
217;00:24:14,212;00:24:15,629;at least.
218;00:24:32,379;00:24:33,838;Can they swim?
219;00:24:35,004;00:24:36,128;No.
220;00:24:36,129;00:24:37,504;Good.
221;00:24:39,254;00:24:42,003;I'm taking the Iron Fleet
221;00:24:39,254;00:24:42,003;back to the Iron Islands.
222;00:24:42,004;00:24:44,086;What are you
222;00:24:42,004;00:24:44,086;talking about?
223;00:24:44,087;00:24:46,003;I've been
223;00:24:44,087;00:24:46,003;around the world.
224;00:24:46,004;00:24:48,378;I've seen everything,
224;00:24:46,004;00:24:48,378;things you couldn't imagine,
225;00:24:48,379;00:24:49,838;and this...
226;00:24:52,212;00:24:55,629;this is the only thing I've
226;00:24:52,212;00:24:55,629;ever seen that terrifies me.
227;00:25:02,962;00:25:04,878;I'm going back
227;00:25:02,962;00:25:04,878;to my island.
228;00:25:04,879;00:25:07,545;You should go
228;00:25:04,879;00:25:07,545;back to yours.
229;00:25:07,546;00:25:09,503;When winter's over,
230;00:25:09,504;00:25:12,170;we'll be the only ones
230;00:25:09,504;00:25:12,170;left alive.
231;00:25:21,629;00:25:23,671;He's right to be afraid.
232;00:25:24,962;00:25:26,628;And a coward to run.
233;00:25:26,629;00:25:28,878;If those things
233;00:25:26,629;00:25:28,878;come for us,
234;00:25:28,879;00:25:30,795;there will be
234;00:25:28,879;00:25:30,795;no kingdoms to rule.
235;00:25:30,796;00:25:33,211;Everything we suffered
235;00:25:30,796;00:25:33,211;will have been for nothing.
236;00:25:33,212;00:25:36,004;Everything we lost
236;00:25:33,212;00:25:36,004;will have been for nothing.
237;00:25:37,754;00:25:39,546;The crown accepts
237;00:25:37,754;00:25:39,546;your truce.
238;00:25:41,879;00:25:45,920;Until the dead are defeated,
238;00:25:41,879;00:25:45,920;they are the true enemy.
239;00:25:54,754;00:25:57,754;In return, the King in the
239;00:25:54,754;00:25:57,754;North will extend this truce.
240;00:25:59,962;00:26:01,961;He will remain in the North
240;00:25:59,962;00:26:01,961;where he belongs.
241;00:26:01,962;00:26:03,878;He will not take up arms
241;00:26:01,962;00:26:03,878;against the Lannisters.
242;00:26:03,879;00:26:06,295;He will not
242;00:26:03,879;00:26:06,295;choose sides.
243;00:26:06,296;00:26:08,587;Just the
243;00:26:06,296;00:26:08,587;King in the North?
244;00:26:08,588;00:26:11,044;Not me?
245;00:26:11,045;00:26:13,670;I would never
245;00:26:11,045;00:26:13,670;ask it of you.
246;00:26:13,671;00:26:15,253;You would never
246;00:26:13,671;00:26:15,253;agree to it.
247;00:26:15,254;00:26:17,754;And if you did, I would trust
247;00:26:15,254;00:26:17,754;you even less than I do now.
248;00:26:19,087;00:26:22,003;I ask it only
248;00:26:19,087;00:26:22,003;of Ned Stark's son.
249;00:26:22,004;00:26:25,546;I know Ned Stark's son
249;00:26:22,004;00:26:25,546;will be true to his word.
250;00:26:39,796;00:26:42,503;I am true to my word.
251;00:26:42,504;00:26:44,254;Or I try to be.
252;00:26:47,379;00:26:49,962;That is why I cannot
252;00:26:47,379;00:26:49,962;give you what you ask.
253;00:26:51,296;00:26:53,962;I cannot serve
253;00:26:51,296;00:26:53,962;two queens.
254;00:26:56,337;00:26:57,753;And I have already
254;00:26:56,337;00:26:57,753;pledged myself
255;00:26:57,754;00:27:01,504;to Queen Daenerys
255;00:26:57,754;00:27:01,504;of House Targaryen.
256;00:27:12,629;00:27:15,211;Then there is
256;00:27:12,629;00:27:15,211;nothing left to discuss.
257;00:27:15,212;00:27:18,211;The dead will come north first.
257;00:27:15,212;00:27:18,211;Enjoy dealing with them.
258;00:27:18,212;00:27:20,212;We will deal with
258;00:27:18,212;00:27:20,212;whatever is left of you.
259;00:27:28,671;00:27:30,336;Ser Jaime.
260;00:27:30,337;00:27:31,795;It's been good
260;00:27:30,337;00:27:31,795;to see you.
261;00:27:31,796;00:27:33,795;I imagine the next time
261;00:27:31,796;00:27:33,795;will be across a battlefield.
262;00:27:33,796;00:27:35,378;We both saw
262;00:27:33,796;00:27:35,378;what just happened.
263;00:27:35,379;00:27:37,128;We both saw
263;00:27:35,379;00:27:37,128;that... thing.
264;00:27:37,129;00:27:39,919;Yes, and I'm not looking forward
264;00:27:37,129;00:27:39,919;to seeing more of them.
265;00:27:39,920;00:27:41,587;But I'm loyal
265;00:27:39,920;00:27:41,587;to the queen,
266;00:27:41,588;00:27:43,503;and you're loyal to Sansa
266;00:27:41,588;00:27:43,503;and her dolt brother.
267;00:27:43,504;00:27:45,628;Oh, fuck loyalty!
268;00:27:45,629;00:27:47,169;Fuck loyalty?
269;00:27:47,170;00:27:50,712;This goes beyond houses
269;00:27:47,170;00:27:50,712;and honor and oaths.
270;00:27:50,713;00:27:52,212;Talk to the queen.
271;00:27:57,838;00:27:59,212;And tell her what?
272;00:28:10,045;00:28:11,713;I wish you
272;00:28:10,045;00:28:11,713;hadn't done that.
273;00:28:15,879;00:28:18,878;I'm grateful
273;00:28:15,879;00:28:18,878;for your loyalty,
274;00:28:18,879;00:28:22,961;but my dragon died
274;00:28:18,879;00:28:22,961;so that we could be here.
275;00:28:22,962;00:28:25,378;If it's all for nothing,
276;00:28:25,379;00:28:27,545;then he died
276;00:28:25,379;00:28:27,545;for nothing.
277;00:28:27,546;00:28:29,044;I know!
278;00:28:29,045;00:28:31,712;I'm pleased you bent
278;00:28:29,045;00:28:31,712;the knee to our queen.
279;00:28:31,713;00:28:34,420;I would have advised
279;00:28:31,713;00:28:34,420;it, had you asked.
280;00:28:34,421;00:28:36,378;But have you
280;00:28:34,421;00:28:36,378;ever considered
281;00:28:36,379;00:28:38,587;learning how to lie
281;00:28:36,379;00:28:38,587;every now and then?
282;00:28:38,588;00:28:39,588;Just a bit?
283;00:28:41,129;00:28:43,962;I'm not going to swear
283;00:28:41,129;00:28:43,962;an oath I can't uphold.
284;00:28:45,337;00:28:46,919;Talk about my father
284;00:28:45,337;00:28:46,919;if you want,
285;00:28:46,920;00:28:50,003;tell me that's the attitude
285;00:28:46,920;00:28:50,003;that got him killed.
286;00:28:50,004;00:28:53,086;But when enough people
286;00:28:50,004;00:28:53,086;make false promises,
287;00:28:53,087;00:28:56,253;words stop meaning
287;00:28:53,087;00:28:56,253;anything.
288;00:28:56,254;00:28:59,420;Then there are no more answers,
288;00:28:56,254;00:28:59,420;only better and better lies.
289;00:28:59,421;00:29:02,169;And lies won't help us
289;00:28:59,421;00:29:02,169;in this fight.
290;00:29:02,170;00:29:04,253;That is indeed a problem.
291;00:29:04,254;00:29:07,796;The more immediate problem
291;00:29:04,254;00:29:07,796;is that we're fucked.
292;00:29:09,004;00:29:10,420;Any ideas
292;00:29:09,004;00:29:10,420;as to how we might
293;00:29:10,421;00:29:12,421;change that state
293;00:29:10,421;00:29:12,421;of affairs?
294;00:29:13,796;00:29:15,253;Only one.
295;00:29:15,254;00:29:17,670;Everyone stays here,
296;00:29:17,671;00:29:20,461;and I go and talk
296;00:29:17,671;00:29:20,461;to my sister.
297;00:29:20,462;00:29:24,878;I didn't come all this way
297;00:29:20,462;00:29:24,878;to have my Hand murdered.
298;00:29:24,879;00:29:26,670;I don't want Cersei
298;00:29:24,879;00:29:26,670;to murder me either.
299;00:29:26,671;00:29:29,670;I could have stayed in my cell and
299;00:29:26,671;00:29:29,670;saved a great deal of trouble.
300;00:29:29,671;00:29:31,712;I did this.
301;00:29:31,713;00:29:34,211;I should go.
301;00:29:31,713;00:29:34,211;She'll definitely murder you.
302;00:29:34,212;00:29:37,588;I go see
302;00:29:34,212;00:29:37,588;my sister alone.
303;00:29:39,087;00:29:40,587;Or we all go home
304;00:29:40,588;00:29:42,337;and we're right back
304;00:29:40,588;00:29:42,337;where we started.
305;00:30:44,212;00:30:48,545;You spoke with her?
305;00:30:44,212;00:30:48,545;At her until she kicked me out.
306;00:30:48,546;00:30:51,628;She thinks I was an
306;00:30:48,546;00:30:51,628;idiot to trust you.
307;00:30:51,629;00:30:53,753;A lot of people seem to
307;00:30:51,629;00:30:53,753;think that, actually.
308;00:30:53,754;00:30:55,378;I'm about to step
308;00:30:53,754;00:30:55,378;into a room
309;00:30:55,379;00:30:57,169;with the most murderous
309;00:30:55,379;00:30:57,169;woman in the world
310;00:30:57,170;00:31:01,086;who's already tried to kill
310;00:30:57,170;00:31:01,086;me twice, that I know of.
311;00:31:01,087;00:31:02,713;Who's an idiot?
312;00:31:06,129;00:31:08,587;I suppose we should
312;00:31:06,129;00:31:08,587;say goodbye,
313;00:31:08,588;00:31:10,170;one idiot to another.
314;00:32:09,129;00:32:11,003;I shouldn't be
314;00:32:09,129;00:32:11,003;surprised, I suppose.
315;00:32:11,004;00:32:12,795;She's your kind of woman...
316;00:32:12,796;00:32:15,336;a foreign whore who
316;00:32:12,796;00:32:15,336;doesn't know her place.
317;00:32:15,337;00:32:19,128;A foreign whore you can't
317;00:32:15,337;00:32:19,128;abduct, beat, or intimidate.
318;00:32:19,129;00:32:20,837;That must be
318;00:32:19,129;00:32:20,837;difficult for you.
319;00:32:20,838;00:32:23,295;So you bring her here
319;00:32:20,838;00:32:23,295;with her pet Northerner,
320;00:32:23,296;00:32:25,211;whom you've convinced to bow down before her.
320;00:32:23,296;00:32:25,211;I didn't know about that.
321;00:32:25,212;00:32:27,295;And now you've got them both
321;00:32:25,212;00:32:27,295;working towards the same goal,
322;00:32:27,296;00:32:29,420;the goal you've worked
322;00:32:27,296;00:32:29,420;towards your entire life...
323;00:32:29,421;00:32:32,503;Cersei, I didn't know.
323;00:32:29,421;00:32:32,503;...the destruction of this family.
324;00:32:32,504;00:32:35,837;I am the one preventing
324;00:32:32,504;00:32:35,837;that from happening.
325;00:32:35,838;00:32:38,378;Daenerys didn't want
325;00:32:35,838;00:32:38,378;to debate and negotiate.
326;00:32:38,379;00:32:39,837;She didn't want
326;00:32:38,379;00:32:39,837;to bring you words.
327;00:32:39,838;00:32:41,795;She wanted to bring you
327;00:32:39,838;00:32:41,795;fire and blood
328;00:32:41,796;00:32:43,919;until I advised her
328;00:32:41,796;00:32:43,919;otherwise.
329;00:32:43,920;00:32:45,712;I don't want
329;00:32:43,920;00:32:45,712;to destroy our family.
330;00:32:45,713;00:32:47,670;I never have.
331;00:32:47,671;00:32:49,128;You killed our father.
332;00:32:49,129;00:32:50,753;After he sentenced me
332;00:32:49,129;00:32:50,753;to death
333;00:32:50,754;00:32:53,336;for a crime I didn't
333;00:32:50,754;00:32:53,336;commit, yes, I killed him.
334;00:32:53,337;00:32:55,003;Hate me for it
334;00:32:53,337;00:32:55,003;if you want.
335;00:32:55,004;00:32:57,336;I hate myself for it
335;00:32:55,004;00:32:57,336;in spite of what he was,
336;00:32:57,337;00:32:59,795;in spite of
336;00:32:57,337;00:32:59,795;what he did to me.
337;00:32:59,796;00:33:01,545;Oh, poor little man.
338;00:33:01,546;00:33:03,253;Your papa
338;00:33:01,546;00:33:03,253;was mean to you.
339;00:33:03,254;00:33:07,295;Do you have any idea what you did
339;00:33:03,254;00:33:07,295;when you fired that crossbow?
340;00:33:07,296;00:33:09,128;You left us open.
341;00:33:09,129;00:33:10,712;You laid us bare
341;00:33:09,129;00:33:10,712;for the vultures,
342;00:33:10,713;00:33:14,253;and the vultures came
342;00:33:10,713;00:33:14,253;and tore us apart.
343;00:33:14,254;00:33:15,919;You may not
343;00:33:14,254;00:33:15,919;have killed Joffrey,
344;00:33:15,920;00:33:17,837;but you killed Myrcella,
344;00:33:15,920;00:33:17,837;you killed Tommen.
345;00:33:17,838;00:33:19,878;No one would've touched them
345;00:33:17,838;00:33:19,878;if Father was here.
346;00:33:19,879;00:33:22,461;No one would have dared...
346;00:33:19,879;00:33:22,461;I have never been more sorry about anything.
347;00:33:22,462;00:33:24,169;I will not hear it,
347;00:33:22,462;00:33:24,169;not from you.
348;00:33:24,170;00:33:25,920;I will not hear it!
349;00:33:28,879;00:33:31,211;All right.
350;00:33:31,212;00:33:32,670;You love your family,
351;00:33:32,671;00:33:35,753;and I have
351;00:33:32,671;00:33:35,753;destroyed it.
352;00:33:35,754;00:33:38,503;I will always
352;00:33:35,754;00:33:38,503;be a threat.
353;00:33:38,504;00:33:39,838;So put an end to me.
354;00:33:48,671;00:33:50,878;If it weren't for me,
354;00:33:48,671;00:33:50,878;you'd have a mother.
355;00:33:50,879;00:33:53,628;If it weren't for me,
355;00:33:50,879;00:33:53,628;you'd have a father.
356;00:33:53,629;00:33:54,961;If it weren't for me,
357;00:33:54,962;00:33:57,044;you'd have
357;00:33:54,962;00:33:57,044;two beautiful children.
358;00:33:57,045;00:33:59,211;I've thought
358;00:33:57,045;00:33:59,211;about killing you
359;00:33:59,212;00:34:00,879;more times
359;00:33:59,212;00:34:00,879;than I can count.
360;00:34:02,588;00:34:04,879;Do it!
360;00:34:02,588;00:34:04,879;Say the word.
361;00:35:13,671;00:35:16,795;I am more sorry about the children
361;00:35:13,671;00:35:16,795;than you could ever know.
362;00:35:16,796;00:35:19,961;I will not...
362;00:35:16,796;00:35:19,961;I don't care. I loved them.
363;00:35:19,962;00:35:21,837;You know I did.
364;00:35:21,838;00:35:25,337;You know it in your heart if
364;00:35:21,838;00:35:25,337;there's anything left of it.
365;00:35:27,462;00:35:29,170;It doesn't matter.
366;00:35:31,129;00:35:34,753;Your love doesn't matter.
366;00:35:31,129;00:35:34,753;Your feelings don't matter.
367;00:35:34,754;00:35:36,919;I don't care
367;00:35:34,754;00:35:36,919;why you did what you did.
368;00:35:36,920;00:35:39,795;I only care
368;00:35:36,920;00:35:39,795;what it cost us.
369;00:35:39,796;00:35:41,170;It cost us our future.
370;00:35:42,838;00:35:44,961;If there's no future,
370;00:35:42,838;00:35:44,961;then why are we here?
371;00:35:44,962;00:35:46,961;Why did you
371;00:35:44,962;00:35:46,961;allow me to come?
372;00:35:46,962;00:35:50,003;Not to help my enemies
372;00:35:46,962;00:35:50,003;collaborate in my destruction.
373;00:35:50,004;00:35:51,753;Yes, no,
373;00:35:50,004;00:35:51,753;not what you hoped for,
374;00:35:51,754;00:35:54,296;but you must have
374;00:35:51,754;00:35:54,296;hoped for something.
375;00:35:55,337;00:35:57,878;What did you hope for?
376;00:35:57,879;00:36:01,545;To make Jon Snow submit to your queen?
376;00:35:57,879;00:36:01,545;Mm, not like this.
377;00:36:01,546;00:36:03,919;But eventually, you want everyone
377;00:36:01,546;00:36:03,919;to bend the knee to her.
378;00:36:03,920;00:36:05,670;Yes.
378;00:36:03,920;00:36:05,670;Why?
379;00:36:05,671;00:36:07,253;Because I think
380;00:36:07,254;00:36:09,086;she will make the world
380;00:36:07,254;00:36:09,086;a better place.
381;00:36:09,087;00:36:11,004;You said she'd destroy
381;00:36:09,087;00:36:11,004;King's Landing.
382;00:36:13,212;00:36:15,128;She knows herself.
383;00:36:15,129;00:36:16,670;She chose an advisor
384;00:36:16,671;00:36:20,003;who would check her worst
384;00:36:16,671;00:36:20,003;impulses instead of feeding them.
385;00:36:20,004;00:36:22,003;That's the difference
385;00:36:20,004;00:36:22,003;between you.
386;00:36:22,004;00:36:24,211;I don't care about
386;00:36:22,004;00:36:24,211;checking my worst impulses.
387;00:36:24,212;00:36:26,837;I don't care about making
387;00:36:24,212;00:36:26,837;the world a better place.
388;00:36:26,838;00:36:28,628;Hang the world.
389;00:36:28,629;00:36:31,086;That thing
389;00:36:28,629;00:36:31,086;you dragged here,
390;00:36:31,087;00:36:34,545;I know what it is,
390;00:36:31,087;00:36:34,545;I know what it means.
391;00:36:34,546;00:36:36,753;And when it came at me,
391;00:36:34,546;00:36:36,753;I didn't think about the world.
392;00:36:36,754;00:36:38,837;Not at all.
393;00:36:38,838;00:36:40,420;As soon as
393;00:36:38,838;00:36:40,420;it opened its mouth,
394;00:36:40,421;00:36:41,795;the world
394;00:36:40,421;00:36:41,795;disappeared for me,
395;00:36:41,796;00:36:43,919;right down
395;00:36:41,796;00:36:43,919;its black throat.
396;00:36:43,920;00:36:46,295;All I could think about was
396;00:36:43,920;00:36:46,295;keeping those gnashing teeth
397;00:36:46,296;00:36:47,837;away from the ones
397;00:36:46,296;00:36:47,837;who matter most,
398;00:36:47,838;00:36:49,628;away from my family.
399;00:36:49,629;00:36:53,253;Maybe Euron Greyjoy
399;00:36:49,629;00:36:53,253;had the right idea.
400;00:36:53,254;00:36:56,044;Get on a boat,
400;00:36:53,254;00:36:56,044;take those who matter...
401;00:36:56,045;00:36:57,212;You're pregnant.
402;00:37:29,671;00:37:32,378;No one is less happy
402;00:37:29,671;00:37:32,378;about this than I am.
403;00:37:32,379;00:37:33,796;I know.
404;00:37:36,462;00:37:38,961;I respect
404;00:37:36,462;00:37:38,961;what you did.
405;00:37:38,962;00:37:41,296;Wish you hadn't done it,
405;00:37:38,962;00:37:41,296;but I respect it.
406;00:37:51,962;00:37:55,462;This place was the beginning
406;00:37:51,962;00:37:55,462;of the end for my family.
407;00:38:01,671;00:38:03,796;A dragon
407;00:38:01,671;00:38:03,796;is not a slave.
408;00:38:06,629;00:38:09,086;They were terrifying.
409;00:38:09,087;00:38:10,796;Extraordinary.
410;00:38:12,212;00:38:15,253;They filled people
410;00:38:12,212;00:38:15,253;with wonder and awe,
411;00:38:15,254;00:38:17,504;and we locked them
411;00:38:15,254;00:38:17,504;in here.
412;00:38:18,796;00:38:20,337;They wasted away.
413;00:38:21,546;00:38:23,837;They grew small.
414;00:38:23,838;00:38:26,462;And we grew small
414;00:38:23,838;00:38:26,462;as well.
415;00:38:27,796;00:38:30,378;We weren't extraordinary
415;00:38:27,796;00:38:30,378;without them.
416;00:38:30,379;00:38:32,212;We were just like
416;00:38:30,379;00:38:32,212;everyone else.
417;00:38:37,254;00:38:39,170;You're not like
417;00:38:37,254;00:38:39,170;everyone else.
418;00:38:45,045;00:38:47,504;And your family
418;00:38:45,045;00:38:47,504;hasn't seen its end.
419;00:38:48,671;00:38:50,295;You're still here.
420;00:38:50,296;00:38:52,837;I can't
420;00:38:50,296;00:38:52,837;have children.
421;00:38:52,838;00:38:54,420;Who told you that?
422;00:38:54,421;00:38:57,378;The witch who
422;00:38:54,421;00:38:57,378;murdered my husband.
423;00:38:57,379;00:38:59,587;Has it occurred to you
423;00:38:57,379;00:38:59,587;she might not have been
424;00:38:59,588;00:39:01,379;a reliable source
424;00:38:59,588;00:39:01,379;of information?
425;00:39:07,212;00:39:09,336;You were right
425;00:39:07,212;00:39:09,336;from the beginning.
426;00:39:09,337;00:39:12,546;If I had trusted you,
426;00:39:09,337;00:39:12,546;everything would be different.
427;00:39:16,629;00:39:18,045;So, what now?
428;00:39:21,962;00:39:24,545;I can't forget what I saw
428;00:39:21,962;00:39:24,545;north of the Wall.
429;00:39:24,546;00:39:26,461;And I can't pretend
429;00:39:24,546;00:39:26,461;that Cersei
430;00:39:26,462;00:39:29,754;won't take back half the country
430;00:39:26,462;00:39:29,754;the moment I march north.
431;00:39:31,879;00:39:34,379;It appears Tyrion's
431;00:39:31,879;00:39:34,379;assessment was correct.
432;00:39:36,796;00:39:37,879;We're fucked.
433;00:40:31,045;00:40:33,129;My armies will not
433;00:40:31,045;00:40:33,129;stand down.
434;00:40:34,588;00:40:36,671;I will not pull them
434;00:40:34,588;00:40:36,671;back to the capital.
435;00:40:40,462;00:40:43,962;I will march them north to fight
435;00:40:40,462;00:40:43,962;alongside you in the Great War.
436;00:40:46,045;00:40:47,962;The darkness
436;00:40:46,045;00:40:47,962;is coming for us all.
437;00:40:49,754;00:40:52,712;We'll face it together.
438;00:40:52,713;00:40:55,503;And when
438;00:40:52,713;00:40:55,503;the Great War is over,
439;00:40:55,504;00:40:58,837;perhaps you'll remember
439;00:40:55,504;00:40:58,837;I chose to help
440;00:40:58,838;00:41:02,296;with no promises or
440;00:40:58,838;00:41:02,296;assurances from any of you.
441;00:41:05,671;00:41:07,713;I expect not.
442;00:41:10,129;00:41:11,878;Call our banners.
443;00:41:11,879;00:41:13,379;All of them.
444;00:41:26,379;00:41:29,628;It's not easy for
444;00:41:26,379;00:41:29,628;ravens to fly in these storms.
445;00:41:29,629;00:41:31,628;Perhaps Jon tried
445;00:41:29,629;00:41:31,628;to send word earlier.
446;00:41:31,629;00:41:35,044;No, this is
446;00:41:31,629;00:41:35,044;the way he is,
447;00:41:35,045;00:41:37,420;the way
447;00:41:35,045;00:41:37,420;he's always been.
448;00:41:37,421;00:41:40,044;He never asked for my opinion.
448;00:41:37,421;00:41:40,044;Why would he start now?
449;00:41:40,045;00:41:43,795;I can't believe he'd surrender the
449;00:41:40,045;00:41:43,795;Northern crown without consulting you.
450;00:41:43,796;00:41:46,211;This is his writing,
450;00:41:43,796;00:41:46,211;his signature.
451;00:41:46,212;00:41:49,378;He pledged to fight
451;00:41:46,212;00:41:49,378;for Daenerys Targaryen.
452;00:41:49,379;00:41:51,461;He's bent the knee.
453;00:41:51,462;00:41:54,044;I've heard gossip
454;00:41:54,045;00:41:58,044;that the Dragon Queen
454;00:41:54,045;00:41:58,044;is quite beautiful.
455;00:41:58,045;00:42:00,254;What does that have to do
455;00:41:58,045;00:42:00,254;with anything?
456;00:42:02,546;00:42:05,295;Jon is young
456;00:42:02,546;00:42:05,295;and unmarried.
457;00:42:05,296;00:42:07,503;Daenerys is young
457;00:42:05,296;00:42:07,503;and unmarried.
458;00:42:07,504;00:42:10,461;You think he wants
458;00:42:07,504;00:42:10,461;to marry her?
459;00:42:10,462;00:42:13,712;An alliance
459;00:42:10,462;00:42:13,712;makes sense.
460;00:42:13,713;00:42:15,920;Together, they'd be
460;00:42:13,713;00:42:15,920;difficult to defeat.
461;00:42:17,546;00:42:20,546;He was named
461;00:42:17,546;00:42:20,546;King in the North.
462;00:42:22,962;00:42:24,379;He can be unnamed.
463;00:42:28,212;00:42:30,878;Even if I wanted to,
463;00:42:28,212;00:42:30,878;Arya would never go along.
464;00:42:30,879;00:42:33,712;She always loved Jon far
464;00:42:30,879;00:42:33,712;more than she ever loved me,
465;00:42:33,713;00:42:36,919;and she'd kill anyone
465;00:42:33,713;00:42:36,919;who betrayed her family.
466;00:42:36,920;00:42:38,920;You are family, too.
467;00:42:40,920;00:42:43,503;Would Arya really murder
467;00:42:40,920;00:42:43,503;her own sister?
468;00:42:43,504;00:42:45,837;Do you know
468;00:42:43,504;00:42:45,837;what she is now?
469;00:42:45,838;00:42:49,211;Do you know what
469;00:42:45,838;00:42:49,211;the Faceless Men are?
470;00:42:49,212;00:42:51,420;Only by reputation.
471;00:42:51,421;00:42:54,587;They worship the God
471;00:42:51,421;00:42:54,587;of Death, I believe.
472;00:42:54,588;00:42:57,211;I never trust
472;00:42:54,588;00:42:57,211;godly men.
473;00:42:57,212;00:42:58,712;They're killers.
474;00:42:58,713;00:43:00,588;And Arya
474;00:42:58,713;00:43:00,588;was one of them.
475;00:43:05,462;00:43:07,044;What do you think
475;00:43:05,462;00:43:07,044;she's after?
476;00:43:07,045;00:43:09,628;She's your sister.
477;00:43:09,629;00:43:11,754;You know her far better
477;00:43:09,629;00:43:11,754;than I ever could.
478;00:43:15,296;00:43:20,044;Sometimes when I try to
478;00:43:15,296;00:43:20,044;understand a person's motives,
479;00:43:20,045;00:43:21,962;I play a little game.
480;00:43:24,462;00:43:26,462;I assume the worst.
481;00:43:29,462;00:43:32,295;What's the worst reason
481;00:43:29,462;00:43:32,295;they could possibly have
482;00:43:32,296;00:43:37,253;for saying what they say
482;00:43:32,296;00:43:37,253;and doing what they do?
483;00:43:37,254;00:43:39,461;Then I ask myself,
484;00:43:39,462;00:43:42,628;How well does
484;00:43:39,462;00:43:42,628;that reason explain
485;00:43:42,629;00:43:45,588;what they say
485;00:43:42,629;00:43:45,588;and what they do?
486;00:43:47,421;00:43:48,961;So, tell me...
487;00:43:48,962;00:43:51,504;what's the worst thing
487;00:43:48,962;00:43:51,504;she could want?
488;00:43:56,337;00:43:59,336;She could
488;00:43:56,337;00:43:59,336;want me dead
489;00:43:59,337;00:44:02,545;because she thinks
489;00:43:59,337;00:44:02,545;I wronged my family.
490;00:44:02,546;00:44:04,838;Why did she come
490;00:44:02,546;00:44:04,838;to Winterfell?
491;00:44:08,045;00:44:10,003;To kill me
492;00:44:10,004;00:44:13,837;for marrying our enemies
492;00:44:10,004;00:44:13,837;and betraying my family.
493;00:44:13,838;00:44:16,838;Why did she unearth the
493;00:44:13,838;00:44:16,838;letter Cersei made you write?
494;00:44:19,546;00:44:23,628;To provide proof
494;00:44:19,546;00:44:23,628;of my betrayals.
495;00:44:23,629;00:44:28,378;To provide justification
495;00:44:23,629;00:44:28,378;after she murders me.
496;00:44:28,379;00:44:32,044;And after
496;00:44:28,379;00:44:32,044;she murders you,
497;00:44:32,045;00:44:34,713;what does she become?
498;00:44:40,212;00:44:41,920;Lady of Winterfell.
499;00:44:56,962;00:44:59,878;If we have the Dothraki
499;00:44:56,962;00:44:59,878;ride hard on the kingsroad,
500;00:44:59,879;00:45:02,545;they'll arrive at Winterfell
500;00:44:59,879;00:45:02,545;within the fortnight.
501;00:45:02,546;00:45:04,044;And the Unsullied?
502;00:45:04,045;00:45:05,670;We can sail with them
502;00:45:04,045;00:45:05,670;to White Harbor,
503;00:45:05,671;00:45:08,378;meet the Dothraki here
503;00:45:05,671;00:45:08,378;on the kingsroad,
504;00:45:08,379;00:45:11,336;then ride together
504;00:45:08,379;00:45:11,336;to Winterfell.
505;00:45:11,337;00:45:14,587;Perhaps you should fly
505;00:45:11,337;00:45:14,587;to Winterfell, Your Grace.
506;00:45:14,588;00:45:17,086;You have many enemies
506;00:45:14,588;00:45:17,086;in the North.
507;00:45:17,087;00:45:19,336;Thousands fell
507;00:45:17,087;00:45:19,336;fighting your father.
508;00:45:19,337;00:45:23,044;All it takes is one angry
508;00:45:19,337;00:45:23,044;man with a crossbow.
509;00:45:23,045;00:45:25,253;He'll see your silver
509;00:45:23,045;00:45:25,253;hair on the kingsroad
510;00:45:25,254;00:45:28,295;and know that one well-placed
510;00:45:25,254;00:45:28,295;bolt will make him a hero.
511;00:45:28,296;00:45:30,920;The man who killed
511;00:45:28,296;00:45:30,920;the conqueror.
512;00:45:32,462;00:45:34,253;It's your decision,
512;00:45:32,462;00:45:34,253;Your Grace.
513;00:45:34,254;00:45:37,461;But if we're going to be
513;00:45:34,254;00:45:37,461;allies in this war,
514;00:45:37,462;00:45:41,545;it's important for the
514;00:45:37,462;00:45:41,545;Northerners to see us as allies.
515;00:45:41,546;00:45:44,712;If we sail
515;00:45:41,546;00:45:44,712;to White Harbor together,
516;00:45:44,713;00:45:46,962;I think it sends
516;00:45:44,713;00:45:46,962;a better message.
517;00:45:53,421;00:45:56,169;I've not come
517;00:45:53,421;00:45:56,169;to conquer the North.
518;00:45:56,170;00:45:58,504;I'm coming to save
518;00:45:56,170;00:45:58,504;the North.
519;00:46:04,129;00:46:05,462;We sail together.
520;00:46:20,629;00:46:21,629;Jon.
521;00:46:23,796;00:46:25,129;Can I speak
521;00:46:23,796;00:46:25,129;with you?
522;00:46:28,462;00:46:29,588;All right.
523;00:46:35,462;00:46:38,044;What you did
523;00:46:35,462;00:46:38,044;in King's Landing,
524;00:46:38,045;00:46:40,170;what you said...
525;00:46:42,337;00:46:45,753;you could've
525;00:46:42,337;00:46:45,753;lied to Cersei
526;00:46:45,754;00:46:48,671;about bending the knee
526;00:46:45,754;00:46:48,671;to Daenerys.
527;00:46:52,671;00:46:55,129;You risked everything
527;00:46:52,671;00:46:55,129;to tell an enemy the truth.
528;00:46:57,045;00:46:59,503;We went down there
528;00:46:57,045;00:46:59,503;to make peace.
529;00:46:59,504;00:47:03,003;And it seems to me we need
529;00:46:59,504;00:47:03,003;to be honest with each other
530;00:47:03,004;00:47:04,379;if we're going
530;00:47:03,004;00:47:04,379;to fight together.
531;00:47:05,920;00:47:08,379;You've always known
531;00:47:05,920;00:47:08,379;what was right.
532;00:47:11,879;00:47:15,169;Even when we were all
532;00:47:11,879;00:47:15,169;young and stupid,
533;00:47:15,170;00:47:16,670;you always knew.
534;00:47:16,671;00:47:18,920;Every step you take...
535;00:47:20,379;00:47:22,253;it's always
535;00:47:20,379;00:47:22,253;the right step.
536;00:47:22,254;00:47:23,378;It's not.
537;00:47:23,379;00:47:25,628;It may seem that way
537;00:47:23,379;00:47:25,628;from the outside,
538;00:47:25,629;00:47:29,045;but I promise you,
538;00:47:25,629;00:47:29,045;it's not true.
539;00:47:31,462;00:47:34,044;I've done plenty of
539;00:47:31,462;00:47:34,044;things that I regret.
540;00:47:34,045;00:47:35,753;Not compared to me, you haven't.
541;00:47:35,754;00:47:37,379;No.
542;00:47:39,212;00:47:41,004;Not compared to you.
543;00:47:52,254;00:47:54,879;I always wanted
543;00:47:52,254;00:47:54,879;to do the right thing.
544;00:47:57,546;00:47:59,628;Be the right
544;00:47:57,546;00:47:59,628;kind of person.
545;00:47:59,629;00:48:02,212;But I never knew
545;00:47:59,629;00:48:02,212;what that meant.
546;00:48:03,629;00:48:05,962;It always seemed
546;00:48:03,629;00:48:05,962;like there's...
547;00:48:10,045;00:48:12,462;like there was an impossible
547;00:48:10,045;00:48:12,462;choice I had to make.
548;00:48:14,920;00:48:16,713;Stark or Greyjoy.
549;00:48:19,962;00:48:24,587;Our father was more of a father
549;00:48:19,962;00:48:24,587;to you than yours ever was.
550;00:48:24,588;00:48:27,420;He was.
550;00:48:24,588;00:48:27,420;And you betrayed him.
551;00:48:27,421;00:48:29,295;Betrayed his memory.
552;00:48:29,296;00:48:30,296;I did.
553;00:48:35,296;00:48:37,045;But you never
553;00:48:35,296;00:48:37,045;lost him.
554;00:48:40,920;00:48:43,004;He's a part of you.
555;00:48:44,546;00:48:46,295;Just like
555;00:48:44,546;00:48:46,295;he's a part of me.
556;00:48:46,296;00:48:48,462;But the things
556;00:48:46,296;00:48:48,462;I've done...
557;00:48:50,170;00:48:52,920;It's not my place to
557;00:48:50,170;00:48:52,920;forgive you for all of it.
558;00:48:56,296;00:48:59,503;But what I can
558;00:48:56,296;00:48:59,503;forgive,
559;00:48:59,504;00:49:00,920;I do.
560;00:49:07,296;00:49:09,462;You don't need
560;00:49:07,296;00:49:09,462;to choose.
561;00:49:10,796;00:49:12,754;You're a Greyjoy...
562;00:49:14,962;00:49:16,296;and you're a Stark.
563;00:49:30,004;00:49:32,919;When I was
563;00:49:30,004;00:49:32,919;Ramsay's prisoner,
564;00:49:32,920;00:49:36,961;Yara tried
564;00:49:32,920;00:49:36,961;to save me.
565;00:49:36,962;00:49:40,503;She's the only one
566;00:49:40,504;00:49:42,462;who tried to save me.
567;00:49:49,546;00:49:51,712;She needs me now.
568;00:49:51,713;00:49:54,504;So, why are you
568;00:49:51,713;00:49:54,504;still talking to me?
569;00:50:08,754;00:50:10,211;Load up.
570;00:50:10,212;00:50:11,837;Load up, lads.
570;00:50:10,212;00:50:11,837;Go on.
571;00:50:11,838;00:50:14,170;Tide's coming in.
572;00:50:30,296;00:50:32,879;All of us chose
572;00:50:30,296;00:50:32,879;to follow Yara.
573;00:50:35,337;00:50:39,169;We left the Iron
573;00:50:35,337;00:50:39,169;Islands for Yara.
574;00:50:39,170;00:50:42,004;She would never
574;00:50:39,170;00:50:42,004;leave one of us behind.
575;00:50:44,879;00:50:46,587;We're not
575;00:50:44,879;00:50:46,587;leaving her behind.
576;00:50:46,588;00:50:48,044;Your sister's dead.
577;00:50:48,045;00:50:49,753;She's not dead.
577;00:50:48,045;00:50:49,753;She's dead.
578;00:50:49,754;00:50:52,628;Even if Euron hasn't cut her
578;00:50:49,754;00:50:52,628;throat yet, she's dead.
579;00:50:52,629;00:50:57,753;She's our queen.
579;00:50:52,629;00:50:57,753;She's your sister, and you left her to die.
580;00:50:57,754;00:50:59,254;I did.
581;00:51:01,629;00:51:04,503;I ran from my uncle.
582;00:51:04,504;00:51:05,919;I was a coward.
583;00:51:05,920;00:51:09,169;So, why in fuck's name
583;00:51:05,920;00:51:09,169;should we listen to you?
584;00:51:09,170;00:51:12,795;They say the dead
584;00:51:09,170;00:51:12,795;can't swim.
585;00:51:12,796;00:51:14,378;We're going
585;00:51:12,796;00:51:14,378;to sail east,
586;00:51:14,379;00:51:16,753;find a nice,
586;00:51:14,379;00:51:16,753;quiet island,
587;00:51:16,754;00:51:19,753;kill all the men, and take
587;00:51:16,754;00:51:19,753;their wives for ourselves.
588;00:51:19,754;00:51:22,169;We're done with all that.
588;00:51:19,754;00:51:22,169;Who says we are?
589;00:51:22,170;00:51:25,087;Yara did.
589;00:51:22,170;00:51:25,087;She made a pledge.
590;00:51:27,004;00:51:30,169;We're going
590;00:51:27,004;00:51:30,169;to find her,
591;00:51:30,170;00:51:32,962;and we're going
591;00:51:30,170;00:51:32,962;to set her free.
592;00:51:41,421;00:51:44,503;Run away,
592;00:51:41,421;00:51:44,503;little Theon.
593;00:51:44,504;00:51:46,462;It's what
593;00:51:44,504;00:51:46,462;you do best.
594;00:51:49,504;00:51:51,295;He needs to shut his mouth.
595;00:51:58,129;00:52:01,004;Hey!
596;00:52:03,045;00:52:07,253;Oh, yes!
597;00:52:07,254;00:52:10,004;That's more like it.
598;00:52:26,879;00:52:27,879;Stay down...
599;00:52:29,129;00:52:30,629;or I'll kill you!
600;00:52:41,170;00:52:44,671;I said stay down
600;00:52:41,170;00:52:44,671;or I'll kill you!
601;00:53:57,588;00:53:59,254;Not for me.
602;00:54:02,546;00:54:04,003;For Yara!
603;00:54:04,004;00:54:05,421;Yara!
604;00:54:51,004;00:54:53,462;Have my sister brought
604;00:54:51,004;00:54:53,462;to the Great Hall.
605;00:55:38,920;00:55:40,713;Are you sure
605;00:55:38,920;00:55:40,713;you want to do this?
606;00:55:43,546;00:55:46,795;It's not what I want.
606;00:55:43,546;00:55:46,795;It's what honor demands.
607;00:55:46,796;00:55:49,712;And what does honor demand?
608;00:55:49,713;00:55:52,587;That I defend my family
608;00:55:49,713;00:55:52,587;from those who would harm us.
609;00:55:52,588;00:55:56,212;That I defend the North from
609;00:55:52,588;00:55:56,212;those who would betray us.
610;00:55:58,462;00:56:00,170;All right, then.
611;00:56:01,588;00:56:02,879;Get on with it.
612;00:56:05,713;00:56:07,878;You stand accused
612;00:56:05,713;00:56:07,878;of murder.
613;00:56:07,879;00:56:10,712;You stand accused
613;00:56:07,879;00:56:10,712;of treason.
614;00:56:10,713;00:56:13,504;How do you answer
614;00:56:10,713;00:56:13,504;these charges...
615;00:56:15,920;00:56:17,754;Lord Baelish?
616;00:56:33,504;00:56:35,045;My sister asked you
616;00:56:33,504;00:56:35,045;a question.
617;00:56:39,754;00:56:41,254;Lady Sansa,
617;00:56:39,754;00:56:41,254;forgive me...
618;00:56:42,920;00:56:44,712;I'm a bit confused.
619;00:56:44,713;00:56:47,003;Which charges
619;00:56:44,713;00:56:47,003;confuse you?
620;00:56:47,004;00:56:49,044;Let's start with
620;00:56:47,004;00:56:49,044;the simplest one...
621;00:56:49,045;00:56:51,628;you murdered our aunt,
621;00:56:49,045;00:56:51,628;Lysa Arryn.
622;00:56:51,629;00:56:54,503;You pushed her through the Moon
622;00:56:51,629;00:56:54,503;Door and watched her fall.
623;00:56:54,504;00:56:56,379;Do you deny it?
624;00:56:58,421;00:56:59,919;I did it
624;00:56:58,421;00:56:59,919;to protect you.
625;00:56:59,920;00:57:01,961;You did it to take
625;00:56:59,920;00:57:01,961;power in the Vale.
626;00:57:01,962;00:57:05,253;Earlier, you conspired
626;00:57:01,962;00:57:05,253;to murder Jon Arryn.
627;00:57:05,254;00:57:07,753;You gave Lysa Tears of Lys
627;00:57:05,254;00:57:07,753;to poison him.
628;00:57:07,754;00:57:08,796;Do you deny it?
629;00:57:11,129;00:57:14,295;Whatever your aunt
629;00:57:11,129;00:57:14,295;might have told you...
630;00:57:14,296;00:57:16,629;she was
630;00:57:14,296;00:57:16,629;a troubled woman.
631;00:57:17,962;00:57:19,253;She imagined enemies
631;00:57:17,962;00:57:19,253;everywhere.
632;00:57:19,254;00:57:21,628;You had Aunt Lysa send
632;00:57:19,254;00:57:21,628;a letter to our parents
633;00:57:21,629;00:57:24,128;telling them it was the
633;00:57:21,629;00:57:24,128;Lannisters who murdered Jon Arryn
634;00:57:24,129;00:57:25,628;when, really,
634;00:57:24,129;00:57:25,628;it was you.
635;00:57:25,629;00:57:27,837;The conflict between
635;00:57:25,629;00:57:27,837;the Starks and the Lannisters,
636;00:57:27,838;00:57:29,336;it was you
636;00:57:27,838;00:57:29,336;who started it.
637;00:57:29,337;00:57:30,420;Do you deny it?
638;00:57:30,421;00:57:32,044;I know
638;00:57:30,421;00:57:32,044;of no such letter.
639;00:57:32,045;00:57:33,878;You conspired
639;00:57:32,045;00:57:33,878;with Cersei Lannister
640;00:57:33,879;00:57:37,587;and Joffrey Baratheon to
640;00:57:33,879;00:57:37,587;betray our father, Ned Stark.
641;00:57:37,588;00:57:40,128;Thanks to your treachery,
641;00:57:37,588;00:57:40,128;he was imprisoned
642;00:57:40,129;00:57:43,587;and later executed on
642;00:57:40,129;00:57:43,587;false charges of treason.
643;00:57:43,588;00:57:46,420;Do you deny it?
643;00:57:43,588;00:57:46,420;I deny it!
644;00:57:46,421;00:57:49,795;None of you were there
644;00:57:46,421;00:57:49,795;to see what happened.
645;00:57:49,796;00:57:51,753;None of you
645;00:57:49,796;00:57:51,753;knows the truth.
646;00:57:51,754;00:57:53,671;You held a knife
646;00:57:51,754;00:57:53,671;to his throat.
647;00:57:58,879;00:58:01,504;You said, I did warn
647;00:57:58,879;00:58:01,504;you not the trust me.
648;00:58:04,838;00:58:09,504;You told our mother this knife
648;00:58:04,838;00:58:09,504;belonged to Tyrion Lannister.
649;00:58:10,838;00:58:12,712;But that was another
649;00:58:10,838;00:58:12,712;one of your lies.
650;00:58:12,713;00:58:14,546;It was yours.
651;00:58:19,671;00:58:22,587;Lady Sansa, I have known
651;00:58:19,671;00:58:22,587;you since you were a girl.
652;00:58:22,588;00:58:25,253;I've protected you.
652;00:58:22,588;00:58:25,253;Protected me?
653;00:58:25,254;00:58:27,379;By selling me
653;00:58:25,254;00:58:27,379;to the Boltons?
654;00:58:28,713;00:58:31,044;If we could
654;00:58:28,713;00:58:31,044;speak alone,
655;00:58:31,045;00:58:32,588;I can explain
655;00:58:31,045;00:58:32,588;everything.
656;00:58:34,796;00:58:37,919;Sometimes when I'm trying to
656;00:58:34,796;00:58:37,919;understand a person's motives,
657;00:58:37,920;00:58:40,503;I play a little game.
658;00:58:40,504;00:58:42,170;I assume the worst.
659;00:58:43,546;00:58:45,461;What's the worst
659;00:58:43,546;00:58:45,461;reason you have
660;00:58:45,462;00:58:47,379;for turning me
660;00:58:45,462;00:58:47,379;against my sister?
661;00:58:49,212;00:58:51,295;That's what you do,
661;00:58:49,212;00:58:51,295;isn't it?
662;00:58:51,296;00:58:53,128;That's what
662;00:58:51,296;00:58:53,128;you've always done...
663;00:58:53,129;00:58:54,961;turn family
663;00:58:53,129;00:58:54,961;against family,
664;00:58:54,962;00:58:56,878;turn sister
664;00:58:54,962;00:58:56,878;against sister.
665;00:58:56,879;00:58:59,086;That's what you did
665;00:58:56,879;00:58:59,086;to our mother and Aunt Lysa,
666;00:58:59,087;00:59:01,295;and that's what
666;00:58:59,087;00:59:01,295;you tried to do to us.
667;00:59:01,296;00:59:02,628;Sansa, please.
668;00:59:02,629;00:59:06,461;I'm a slow learner,
668;00:59:02,629;00:59:06,461;it's true.
669;00:59:06,462;00:59:07,919;But I learn.
670;00:59:07,920;00:59:10,169;Give me a chance
670;00:59:07,920;00:59:10,169;to defend myself.
671;00:59:10,170;00:59:11,462;I deserve that.
672;00:59:17,296;00:59:18,878;I am Lord Protector
672;00:59:17,296;00:59:18,878;of the Vale
673;00:59:18,879;00:59:21,253;and I command you to escort
673;00:59:18,879;00:59:21,253;me safely back to the Eyrie.
674;00:59:21,254;00:59:22,546;I think not.
675;00:59:25,838;00:59:28,546;Sansa, I beg you!
676;00:59:30,045;00:59:32,086;I loved your mother since
676;00:59:30,045;00:59:32,086;the time I was a boy.
677;00:59:32,087;00:59:33,879;And yet,
677;00:59:32,087;00:59:33,879;you betrayed her.
678;00:59:35,920;00:59:39,086;I loved you.
679;00:59:39,087;00:59:40,713;More than anyone.
680;00:59:41,838;00:59:43,629;And yet,
680;00:59:41,838;00:59:43,629;you betrayed me.
681;00:59:46,254;00:59:48,003;When you brought me
681;00:59:46,254;00:59:48,003;back to Winterfell,
682;00:59:48,004;00:59:50,545;you told me there's no
682;00:59:48,004;00:59:50,545;justice in the world,
683;00:59:50,546;00:59:52,754;not unless
683;00:59:50,546;00:59:52,754;we make it.
684;00:59:54,754;00:59:59,169;Thank you for all your many
684;00:59:54,754;00:59:59,169;lessons, Lord Baelish.
685;00:59:59,170;01:00:01,462;I will never
685;00:59:59,170;01:00:01,462;forget them.
686;01:00:05,170;01:00:06,170;Sansa!
687;01:00:13,170;01:00:14,296;I...
688;01:00:37,379;01:00:38,837;Our men in King's Landing
689;01:00:38,838;01:00:40,503;will march north
689;01:00:38,838;01:00:40,503;in three days' time.
690;01:00:40,504;01:00:41,878;It'll take us a fortnight
691;01:00:41,879;01:00:43,211;just to gather supplies
691;01:00:41,879;01:00:43,211;for the train.
692;01:00:43,212;01:00:44,753;We don't
692;01:00:43,212;01:00:44,753;have a fortnight.
693;01:00:44,754;01:00:46,753;If the North falls, we fall.
693;01:00:44,754;01:00:46,753;Three days.
694;01:00:46,754;01:00:48,295;The remaining forces
694;01:00:46,754;01:00:48,295;in the Westerlands
695;01:00:48,296;01:00:50,003;will take
695;01:00:48,296;01:00:50,003;the river road east.
696;01:00:50,004;01:00:51,545;We'll meet at
696;01:00:50,004;01:00:51,545;Lord Harroway's Town
697;01:00:51,546;01:00:53,545;and march together
697;01:00:51,546;01:00:53,545;to Winterfell.
698;01:00:53,546;01:00:54,713;Ser Jaime.
699;01:00:55,838;01:00:57,211;Your Grace.
700;01:00:57,212;01:00:59,671;My lords, I need a
700;01:00:57,212;01:00:59,671;moment with my brother.
701;01:01:01,296;01:01:03,129;Your Grace.
702;01:01:06,337;01:01:10,169;What are you doing?
702;01:01:06,337;01:01:10,169;Preparing the expedition north.
703;01:01:10,170;01:01:12,753;Expedition north?
704;01:01:12,754;01:01:16,044;I always knew you were
704;01:01:12,754;01:01:16,044;the stupidest Lannister.
705;01:01:16,045;01:01:18,712;The Starks and Targaryens
705;01:01:16,045;01:01:18,712;have united against us,
706;01:01:18,713;01:01:20,837;and you want to fight
706;01:01:18,713;01:01:20,837;alongside them?
707;01:01:20,838;01:01:22,795;Are you a traitor
707;01:01:20,838;01:01:22,795;or an idiot?
708;01:01:22,796;01:01:24,753;You pledged our forces
708;01:01:22,796;01:01:24,753;to fight our common enemy...
709;01:01:24,754;01:01:26,211;I'll say whatever
709;01:01:24,754;01:01:26,211;I need to say
710;01:01:26,212;01:01:27,919;to ensure the survival
710;01:01:26,212;01:01:27,919;of our house.
711;01:01:27,920;01:01:30,670;You expect me to trust the
711;01:01:27,920;01:01:30,670;man who murdered our father?
712;01:01:30,671;01:01:34,253;You expect me to command our troops
712;01:01:30,671;01:01:34,253;to fight beside foreign scum,
713;01:01:34,254;01:01:35,753;to fight for
713;01:01:34,254;01:01:35,753;the Dragon Queen?
714;01:01:35,754;01:01:37,670;You saw it
714;01:01:35,754;01:01:37,670;with your own eyes.
715;01:01:37,671;01:01:40,044;You saw a dead man
715;01:01:37,671;01:01:40,044;trying to kill us.
716;01:01:40,045;01:01:41,878;I saw it burn.
717;01:01:41,879;01:01:43,712;If dragons
717;01:01:41,879;01:01:43,712;can't stop them,
718;01:01:43,713;01:01:46,753;if Dothraki and Unsullied
718;01:01:43,713;01:01:46,753;and Northmen can't stop them,
719;01:01:46,754;01:01:48,753;how will our armies
719;01:01:46,754;01:01:48,753;make a difference?
720;01:01:48,754;01:01:50,753;This isn't about
720;01:01:48,754;01:01:50,753;noble houses,
721;01:01:50,754;01:01:52,878;this is about
721;01:01:50,754;01:01:52,878;the living and the dead!
722;01:01:52,879;01:01:54,919;And I intend to stay
722;01:01:52,879;01:01:54,919;amongst the living.
723;01:01:54,920;01:01:58,128;Let the Stark boy and his
723;01:01:54,920;01:01:58,128;new queen defend the North.
724;01:01:58,129;01:02:00,336;We stay here
724;01:01:58,129;01:02:00,336;where we've always been.
725;01:02:00,337;01:02:02,879;I made a promise.
726;01:02:05,045;01:02:08,461;Our child
726;01:02:05,045;01:02:08,461;will rule Westeros.
727;01:02:08,462;01:02:13,336;Our child will never be born
727;01:02:08,462;01:02:13,336;if the dead come south.
728;01:02:13,337;01:02:14,919;The monsters are real.
729;01:02:14,920;01:02:17,044;The white walkers,
730;01:02:17,045;01:02:19,295;the dragons,
730;01:02:17,045;01:02:19,295;the Dothraki screamers...
731;01:02:19,296;01:02:23,295;all the frightening stories we heard
731;01:02:19,296;01:02:23,295;when we were young, they're all real.
732;01:02:23,296;01:02:25,003;So be it.
733;01:02:25,004;01:02:27,128;Let the monsters
733;01:02:25,004;01:02:27,128;kill each other.
734;01:02:27,129;01:02:29,378;And while they battle
734;01:02:27,129;01:02:29,378;in the North,
735;01:02:29,379;01:02:31,795;we take back the lands
735;01:02:29,379;01:02:31,795;that belong to us.
736;01:02:31,796;01:02:34,587;And then what?
736;01:02:31,796;01:02:34,587;And then we rule.
737;01:02:34,588;01:02:37,503;When the fighting in the
737;01:02:34,588;01:02:37,503;North is over, someone wins.
738;01:02:37,504;01:02:39,670;You understand that,
738;01:02:37,504;01:02:39,670;don't you?
739;01:02:39,671;01:02:43,169;If the dead win, they march
739;01:02:39,671;01:02:43,169;south and kill us all.
740;01:02:43,170;01:02:46,253;If the living win,
740;01:02:43,170;01:02:46,253;and we've betrayed them,
741;01:02:46,254;01:02:48,211;they march south
741;01:02:46,254;01:02:48,211;and kill us all!
742;01:02:48,212;01:02:51,211;The Targaryens and the Starks
742;01:02:48,212;01:02:51,211;already want to kill us all.
743;01:02:51,212;01:02:52,628;Most of them
743;01:02:51,212;01:02:52,628;will die in the North.
744;01:02:52,629;01:02:54,211;I faced them
744;01:02:52,629;01:02:54,211;in the field.
745;01:02:54,212;01:02:56,753;We can't beat them.
745;01:02:54,212;01:02:56,753;We can't beat their dragons.
746;01:02:56,754;01:02:58,295;How many dragons
746;01:02:56,754;01:02:58,295;did you see at the pit?
747;01:02:58,296;01:03:00,295;Two.
747;01:02:58,296;01:03:00,295;What happened to the third?
748;01:03:00,296;01:03:02,795;For all we know,
748;01:03:00,296;01:03:02,795;it's guarding her fleet!
749;01:03:02,796;01:03:06,128;She came here with her dragons and
749;01:03:02,796;01:03:06,128;her Dothraki and her Unsullied.
750;01:03:06,129;01:03:08,919;She came here to show us
750;01:03:06,129;01:03:08,919;all her power.
751;01:03:08,920;01:03:11,961;No, something happened.
751;01:03:08,920;01:03:11,961;The dragons are vulnerable.
752;01:03:11,962;01:03:14,503;We can't beat the Dothraki.
752;01:03:11,962;01:03:14,503;We don't have the numbers.
753;01:03:14,504;01:03:16,336;We don't have the support
753;01:03:14,504;01:03:16,336;of the other houses!
754;01:03:16,337;01:03:19,004;No, we have something better.
754;01:03:16,337;01:03:19,004;We have the Iron Bank.
755;01:03:21,004;01:03:24,961;You should've listened more when Father
755;01:03:21,004;01:03:24,961;spoke about the importance of gold.
756;01:03:24,962;01:03:27,128;Oh, I know
756;01:03:24,962;01:03:27,128;it's boring for you.
757;01:03:27,129;01:03:30,753;You just wanted to hunt
757;01:03:27,129;01:03:30,753;and ride and fight.
758;01:03:30,754;01:03:33,336;But I listened,
758;01:03:30,754;01:03:33,336;I learned.
759;01:03:33,337;01:03:37,336;Highgarden bought us the most
759;01:03:33,337;01:03:37,336;powerful army in Essos...
760;01:03:37,337;01:03:39,128;the Golden Company.
761;01:03:39,129;01:03:42,837;20,000 men, horses,
761;01:03:39,129;01:03:42,837;elephants, I believe.
762;01:03:42,838;01:03:44,503;The Golden Company
762;01:03:42,838;01:03:44,503;is not here.
763;01:03:44,504;01:03:45,878;They're in Essos.
764;01:03:45,879;01:03:49,837;How is a mercenary company
764;01:03:45,879;01:03:49,837;in Essos going to help us?
765;01:03:49,838;01:03:52,336;Do you really think
765;01:03:49,838;01:03:52,336;Euron Greyjoy turned tail
766;01:03:52,337;01:03:53,962;and sailed back
766;01:03:52,337;01:03:53,962;to the Iron Islands?
767;01:03:55,087;01:03:56,461;Do you think
767;01:03:55,087;01:03:56,461;he abandoned
768;01:03:56,462;01:03:59,712;the chance to marry
768;01:03:56,462;01:03:59,712;the queen?
769;01:03:59,713;01:04:02,045;No one walks away
769;01:03:59,713;01:04:02,045;from me.
770;01:04:03,879;01:04:05,545;He's sailing with
770;01:04:03,879;01:04:05,545;his fleet to Essos.
771;01:04:05,546;01:04:07,628;He's going to ferry
771;01:04:05,546;01:04:07,628;the Golden Company back here
772;01:04:07,629;01:04:09,170;to help us win
772;01:04:07,629;01:04:09,170;the war for Westeros.
773;01:04:11,713;01:04:14,878;You plotted with Euron
773;01:04:11,713;01:04:14,878;Greyjoy without telling me,
774;01:04:14,879;01:04:16,712;the commander
774;01:04:14,879;01:04:16,712;of your armies?
775;01:04:16,713;01:04:19,336;And you conspired
775;01:04:16,713;01:04:19,336;with Tyrion,
776;01:04:19,337;01:04:20,712;the man who murdered
776;01:04:19,337;01:04:20,712;our father,
777;01:04:20,713;01:04:22,044;without telling me,
777;01:04:20,713;01:04:22,044;your queen.
778;01:04:22,045;01:04:23,503;I didn't conspire
778;01:04:22,045;01:04:23,503;with him.
779;01:04:23,504;01:04:25,378;You met with him in secret
779;01:04:23,504;01:04:25,378;without my consent.
780;01:04:25,379;01:04:27,378;You planned to promote
780;01:04:25,379;01:04:27,378;my enemies' interests.
781;01:04:27,379;01:04:29,670;That is the definition
781;01:04:27,379;01:04:29,670;of conspiracy.
782;01:04:29,671;01:04:32,044;I pledged
782;01:04:29,671;01:04:32,044;to ride north.
783;01:04:32,045;01:04:33,878;I intend to honor
783;01:04:32,045;01:04:33,878;that pledge.
784;01:04:33,879;01:04:36,086;And that will be treason.
784;01:04:33,879;01:04:36,086;Treason?
785;01:04:36,087;01:04:38,336;Disobeying your queen's command,
785;01:04:36,087;01:04:38,336;fighting with her enemies.
786;01:04:38,337;01:04:39,671;What would you
786;01:04:38,337;01:04:39,671;call it?
787;01:04:41,671;01:04:43,546;Doesn't matter
787;01:04:41,671;01:04:43,546;what I'd call it.
788;01:04:50,504;01:04:53,254;I told you no one
788;01:04:50,504;01:04:53,254;walks away from me.
789;01:04:55,588;01:04:58,129;Are you going to
789;01:04:55,588;01:04:58,129;order him to kill me?
790;01:05:00,254;01:05:02,211;I'm the only one
790;01:05:00,254;01:05:02,211;you have left.
791;01:05:02,212;01:05:04,670;Our children are gone,
791;01:05:02,212;01:05:04,670;our father is gone.
792;01:05:04,671;01:05:06,420;It's just
792;01:05:04,671;01:05:06,420;me and you now.
793;01:05:06,421;01:05:08,421;There's one more
793;01:05:06,421;01:05:08,421;yet to come.
794;01:05:11,421;01:05:13,421;Give the order, then.
795;01:05:32,796;01:05:34,504;I don't
795;01:05:32,796;01:05:34,504;believe you.
796;01:07:22,421;01:07:24,920;Come in.
797;01:07:28,920;01:07:30,378;Samwell Tarly.
798;01:07:30,379;01:07:32,587;I wasn't sure
798;01:07:30,379;01:07:32,587;if you'd remember me.
799;01:07:32,588;01:07:34,421;I remember everything.
800;01:07:42,588;01:07:44,753;You helped us
800;01:07:42,588;01:07:44,753;get beyond the Wall.
801;01:07:44,754;01:07:47,295;You're a good man.
801;01:07:44,754;01:07:47,295;Oh, well, thank you,
802;01:07:47,296;01:07:49,920;but, um, I'm not sure
802;01:07:47,296;01:07:49,920;that I am.
803;01:07:54,087;01:07:56,254;What happened to you
803;01:07:54,087;01:07:56,254;beyond the Wall?
804;01:07:57,671;01:07:59,254;I became
804;01:07:57,671;01:07:59,254;the Three-Eyed Raven.
805;01:08:00,879;01:08:01,962;Oh!
806;01:08:05,254;01:08:07,628;I don't know
806;01:08:05,254;01:08:07,628;what that means.
807;01:08:07,629;01:08:10,378;I can see things
807;01:08:07,629;01:08:10,378;that happened in the past.
808;01:08:10,379;01:08:14,461;I can see things
808;01:08:10,379;01:08:14,461;happening now
809;01:08:14,462;01:08:15,962;all over the world.
810;01:08:17,379;01:08:19,796;Why did you come
810;01:08:17,379;01:08:19,796;to Winterfell?
811;01:08:21,087;01:08:22,462;Um...
812;01:08:24,671;01:08:26,837;Jon's the one to lead
812;01:08:24,671;01:08:26,837;the fight against the dead.
813;01:08:26,838;01:08:28,919;I know he is.
814;01:08:28,920;01:08:30,878;But he can't
814;01:08:28,920;01:08:30,878;do it alone,
815;01:08:30,879;01:08:33,753;so I've come here
815;01:08:30,879;01:08:33,753;to help him.
816;01:08:33,754;01:08:36,628;He's on his way
816;01:08:33,754;01:08:36,628;back to Winterfell
817;01:08:36,629;01:08:38,254;with Daenerys Targaryen.
818;01:08:39,421;01:08:42,461;You...
818;01:08:39,421;01:08:42,461;you saw this in...
819;01:08:42,462;01:08:44,129;in a vision?
820;01:08:47,129;01:08:48,337;Oh.
821;01:08:51,129;01:08:53,337;He needs to know
821;01:08:51,129;01:08:53,337;the truth.
822;01:08:54,588;01:08:55,878;The truth
822;01:08:54,588;01:08:55,878;about what?
823;01:08:55,879;01:08:57,670;About himself.
824;01:08:57,671;01:09:01,211;No one knows.
824;01:08:57,671;01:09:01,211;No one but me.
825;01:09:01,212;01:09:04,169;Jon isn't really
825;01:09:01,212;01:09:04,169;my father's son.
826;01:09:04,170;01:09:08,336;He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen
826;01:09:04,170;01:09:08,336;and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.
827;01:09:08,337;01:09:12,169;He was born
827;01:09:08,337;01:09:12,169;in a tower in Dorne.
828;01:09:12,170;01:09:14,628;His last name
828;01:09:12,170;01:09:14,628;isn't really Snow,
829;01:09:14,629;01:09:15,629;it's Sand.
830;01:09:18,004;01:09:19,004;It's not.
831;01:09:20,588;01:09:23,003;Dornish bastards
831;01:09:20,588;01:09:23,003;are named Sand.
832;01:09:23,004;01:09:26,628;At the Citadel, I transcribed
832;01:09:23,004;01:09:26,628;a High Septon's diary.
833;01:09:26,629;01:09:29,379;He annulled Rhaegar's
833;01:09:26,629;01:09:29,379;marriage to Elia.
834;01:09:31,170;01:09:34,087;He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna
834;01:09:31,170;01:09:34,087;in a secret ceremony.
835;01:09:35,379;01:09:36,837;Are you certain?
836;01:09:36,838;01:09:39,545;It's what the High Septon
836;01:09:36,838;01:09:39,545;wrote in his private diary.
837;01:09:39,546;01:09:41,379;I don't know
837;01:09:39,546;01:09:41,379;why he'd lie.
838;01:09:43,212;01:09:45,754;Is this something
838;01:09:43,212;01:09:45,754;you can see?
839;01:09:47,212;01:09:51,044;Father, Smith, Warrior,
840;01:09:51,045;01:09:55,919;Mother, Maiden,
840;01:09:51,045;01:09:55,919;Crone, Stranger.
841;01:09:55,920;01:09:59,712;I am hers and she is mine...
841;01:09:55,920;01:09:59,712;I am his and he is mine...
842;01:09:59,713;01:10:04,044;from this day
842;01:09:59,713;01:10:04,044;until the end of my days.
843;01:10:04,045;01:10:07,170;Robert's
843;01:10:04,045;01:10:07,170;Rebellion was built on a lie.
844;01:10:09,296;01:10:12,421;Rhaegar didn't
844;01:10:09,296;01:10:12,421;kidnap my aunt or rape her.
845;01:10:22,004;01:10:23,546;He loved her.
846;01:10:31,296;01:10:32,920;And she loved him.
847;01:10:59,337;01:11:02,296;And Jon...
848;01:11:04,337;01:11:06,129;Jon's real name...
849;01:11:08,129;01:11:12,461;His name
849;01:11:08,129;01:11:12,461;is Aegon Targaryen.
850;01:11:12,462;01:11:14,671;You have
850;01:11:12,462;01:11:14,671;to protect him.
851;01:11:16,170;01:11:18,087;Promise me, Ned.
852;01:11:40,879;01:11:43,170;He's never been a bastard.
853;01:11:47,087;01:11:49,796;He's the
853;01:11:47,087;01:11:49,796;heir to the Iron Throne.
854;01:12:04,629;01:12:06,337;He needs to know.
855;01:12:09,546;01:12:11,337;We need to tell him.
856;01:12:21,671;01:12:24,378;Are you
856;01:12:21,671;01:12:24,378;all right?
857;01:12:24,379;01:12:26,295;It's just strange.
858;01:12:26,296;01:12:30,254;In his own horrible way,
858;01:12:26,296;01:12:30,254;I believe he loved me.
859;01:12:34,212;01:12:35,753;You did
859;01:12:34,212;01:12:35,753;the right thing.
860;01:12:35,754;01:12:38,295;You did it.
861;01:12:38,296;01:12:40,128;I'm just
861;01:12:38,296;01:12:40,128;the executioner.
862;01:12:40,129;01:12:41,879;You passed
862;01:12:40,129;01:12:41,879;the sentence.
863;01:12:44,045;01:12:46,878;You're the Lady
863;01:12:44,045;01:12:46,878;of Winterfell.
864;01:12:46,879;01:12:48,254;Does that bother you?
865;01:12:50,838;01:12:53,713;I was never going to be
865;01:12:50,838;01:12:53,713;as good a lady as you.
866;01:12:55,170;01:12:56,671;So I had to be
866;01:12:55,170;01:12:56,671;something else.
867;01:12:58,879;01:13:01,628;I never could have survived
867;01:12:58,879;01:13:01,628;what you survived.
868;01:13:01,629;01:13:03,961;You would have.
869;01:13:03,962;01:13:05,962;You're the strongest
869;01:13:03,962;01:13:05,962;person I know.
870;01:13:10,045;01:13:12,588;I believe that's the nicest
870;01:13:10,045;01:13:12,588;thing you've ever said to me.
871;01:13:14,170;01:13:17,961;Well, don't get
871;01:13:14,170;01:13:17,961;used to it.
872;01:13:17,962;01:13:20,212;You're still very
872;01:13:17,962;01:13:20,212;strange and annoying.
873;01:13:26,713;01:13:28,713;In winter, we must
873;01:13:26,713;01:13:28,713;protect ourselves.
874;01:13:30,254;01:13:32,296;Look after
874;01:13:30,254;01:13:32,296;one another.
875;01:13:34,421;01:13:36,129;Father.
876;01:13:39,254;01:13:43,420;When the snows fall
876;01:13:39,254;01:13:43,420;and the white winds blow,
877;01:13:43,421;01:13:45,378;the lone wolf dies,
878;01:13:45,379;01:13:47,838;but the pack survives.
879;01:13:54,838;01:13:56,129;I miss him.
880;01:13:59,462;01:14:00,962;Me, too.
881;01:15:22,588;01:15:24,712;It's a long way down.
882;01:15:24,713;01:15:28,546;Yeah. The crows keep telling
882;01:15:24,713;01:15:28,546;me I'll get used to it.
883;01:15:37,296;01:15:40,336;I can see movement...
884;01:15:40,337;01:15:43,045;Watch, on the tree line!
885;01:15:44,170;01:15:45,878;What is it?
886;01:17:17,045;01:17:18,170;Come on!
887;01:17:19,379;01:17:22,004;Run! Run!
