135;00:09:37,855;00:09:41,942;Ramsay Snow, my bastard.
136;00:09:41,993;00:09:44,027;A pleasure, Mother.
137;00:09:44,078;00:09:46,112;Hello.
138;00:09:46,163;00:09:48,832;Roose: — See that the horses are
138;00:09:46,163;00:09:48,832;fed, watered, and rubbed down.
139;00:09:48,866;00:09:52,168;And take Lady Walda
139;00:09:48,866;00:09:52,168;to her chambers.
140;00:09:52,203;00:09:54,204;This way, my lady.
141;00:09:54,255;00:09:56,339;Where is your prize?
142;00:09:56,374;00:09:57,958;With the hounds.
143;00:09:59,343;00:10:01,595;I'll have a look at him.
144;00:10:07,018;00:10:09,219;I hear you took a hand
144;00:10:07,018;00:10:09,219;from the Kingslayer.
145;00:10:09,270;00:10:12,055;Word travels.
145;00:10:09,270;00:10:12,055;How he screamed.
146;00:10:12,057;00:10:14,558;— You would have loved it.
146;00:10:12,057;00:10:14,558;— ( laughs )
147;00:10:23,901;00:10:25,735;Father.
148;00:10:34,245;00:10:36,046;What did you do to him?
149;00:10:36,080;00:10:40,383;I trained him.
149;00:10:36,080;00:10:40,383;He was a slow learner, but he learned.
150;00:10:40,418;00:10:43,053;You flayed him.
151;00:10:43,087;00:10:45,422;Peeled a few bits.
152;00:10:45,473;00:10:47,424;Removed a few others.
153;00:10:49,927;00:10:52,312;This was Balon Greyjoy's
153;00:10:49,927;00:10:52,312;son and heir.
154;00:10:52,346;00:10:54,764;We've been flaying
154;00:10:52,346;00:10:54,764;our enemies for 1,000 years.
155;00:10:54,766;00:10:56,850;The flayed man
155;00:10:54,766;00:10:56,850;is on our banners.
156;00:10:56,901;00:10:58,735;My banners, not yours.
157;00:10:58,769;00:11:00,770;You're not a Bolton.
157;00:10:58,769;00:11:00,770;You're a Snow.
158;00:11:04,442;00:11:06,943;Tywin Lannister has given
158;00:11:04,442;00:11:06,943;me the North.
159;00:11:06,994;00:11:09,496;But he won't lift a finger
159;00:11:06,994;00:11:09,496;to help me take it.
160;00:11:09,530;00:11:11,414;As long as the ironborn
160;00:11:09,530;00:11:11,414;hold Moat Cailin,
161;00:11:11,449;00:11:13,650;our armies are trapped
161;00:11:11,449;00:11:13,650;south of the Neck.
162;00:11:13,684;00:11:16,953;Theon was a valuable
162;00:11:13,684;00:11:16,953;hostage, not your plaything.
163;00:11:16,955;00:11:20,423;I wanted to trade him
163;00:11:16,955;00:11:20,423;for Moat Cailin.
164;00:11:20,458;00:11:22,258;I already asked.
165;00:11:22,293;00:11:25,762;Lord Greyjoy refused.
165;00:11:22,293;00:11:25,762;Savages have no–
166;00:11:25,796;00:11:28,798;You sent terms to Balon
166;00:11:25,796;00:11:28,798;Greyjoy without my consent?
167;00:11:28,800;00:11:30,884;You made me acting
167;00:11:28,800;00:11:30,884;Lord of the Dreadfort.
168;00:11:30,935;00:11:32,385;I acted.
169;00:11:38,392;00:11:41,027;I had to smuggle myself
169;00:11:38,392;00:11:41,027;into my own lands
170;00:11:41,062;00:11:42,862;thanks to the Greyjoys.
171;00:11:42,897;00:11:44,864;I needed Theon.
172;00:11:44,899;00:11:46,816;I needed him whole.
173;00:11:46,867;00:11:50,320;Theon was our enemy.
174;00:11:50,371;00:11:52,372;But Reek,
175;00:11:52,406;00:11:55,241;Reek will never betray us.
176;00:11:56,410;00:11:58,995;I placed far too much
176;00:11:56,410;00:11:58,995;trust in you.
177;00:12:07,805;00:12:11,675;Reek, how could you let me stand
177;00:12:07,805;00:12:11,675;before my father unshaven?
178;00:12:11,677;00:12:15,178;—  It's disrespectful.
178;00:12:11,677;00:12:15,178;— I'm sorry, my lord.
179;00:12:17,398;00:12:19,516;Give him the razor.
180;00:12:27,358;00:12:30,610;If I'm not a Bolton,
180;00:12:27,358;00:12:30,610;Father, what does it matter?
181;00:12:38,753;00:12:40,286;Go on, Reek.
182;00:12:40,337;00:12:42,756;A nice close shave.
183;00:13:03,027;00:13:06,479;Reek, tell Father
184;00:13:06,530;00:13:09,566;where are Bran and Rickon Stark?
185;00:13:09,568;00:13:11,618;I don't know, my lord.
186;00:13:11,652;00:13:13,403;You murdered them
187;00:13:13,437;00:13:17,207;and displayed their corpses
187;00:13:13,437;00:13:17,207;at Winterfell.
188;00:13:17,241;00:13:20,660;Ramsay: — Reek,
189;00:13:20,694;00:13:22,912;did you murder the Stark boys?
190;00:13:22,963;00:13:25,131;No, my lord.
191;00:13:25,166;00:13:26,416;Just two farm boys.
192;00:13:26,467;00:13:29,419;Ramsay: — And crisped them
192;00:13:26,467;00:13:29,419;so no one would know.
193;00:13:29,470;00:13:32,088;Theon:
193;00:13:29,470;00:13:32,088;Yes, my lord.
194;00:13:33,891;00:13:36,593;The Starks have always
194;00:13:33,891;00:13:36,593;ruled the North.
195;00:13:36,644;00:13:39,312;If Bran and Rickon are alive,
196;00:13:39,346;00:13:41,931;the country will rally
196;00:13:39,346;00:13:41,931;to their side
197;00:13:41,933;00:13:44,150;now that Robb Stark is gone.
198;00:13:46,320;00:13:49,189;Oh, that's right, Reek.
199;00:13:50,624;00:13:52,659;Robb Stark is dead.
200;00:13:52,693;00:13:55,445;Sorry.
201;00:13:55,447;00:13:57,747;I know he was like
201;00:13:55,447;00:13:57,747;a brother to you.
202;00:13:57,782;00:14:00,700;But my father put a knife
202;00:13:57,782;00:14:00,700;through his heart.
203;00:14:04,004;00:14:06,122;How do you feel about that?
204;00:14:19,603;00:14:22,021;— You ready for a hunt?
204;00:14:19,603;00:14:22,021;— Always.
205;00:14:22,056;00:14:25,308;Find those boys and I'll give
205;00:14:22,056;00:14:25,308;you 1,000 acres and a holdfast.
206;00:14:25,310;00:14:27,360;Your pet rat have any thoughts
207;00:14:27,394;00:14:29,612;on which way they went
207;00:14:27,394;00:14:29,612;after Winterfell?
208;00:14:31,615;00:14:33,783;Jon Snow is at Castle Black.
209;00:14:35,202;00:14:37,153;Who the fuck is Jon Snow?
210;00:14:37,155;00:14:38,538;Their bastard brother.
211;00:14:38,572;00:14:40,824;He could be sheltering them.
212;00:14:40,875;00:14:42,458;He may know where they are.
213;00:14:44,078;00:14:47,547;Even if he doesn't,
213;00:14:44,078;00:14:47,547;he's half Stark himself.
214;00:14:47,581;00:14:49,215;Could be a threat.
215;00:14:49,250;00:14:51,401;You want to prove
215;00:14:49,250;00:14:51,401;yourself a Bolton?
216;00:14:51,435;00:14:55,004;Gather whatever men you can
216;00:14:51,435;00:14:55,004;and ride for Moat Cailin.
217;00:14:55,006;00:14:57,257;Bring this creature of yours.
218;00:14:58,475;00:15:00,593;Maybe he'll be of some use.
219;00:15:02,980;00:15:05,014;Take the Moat for the family,
220;00:15:05,065;00:15:06,733;for our family,
221;00:15:06,767;00:15:09,269;and I'll reconsider
221;00:15:06,767;00:15:09,269;your position.
222;00:15:12,356;00:15:15,825;Lord Varys.
222;00:15:12,356;00:15:15,825;Breakfasting with the king?
223;00:15:15,860;00:15:19,162;I'm afraid foreigners aren't
223;00:15:15,860;00:15:19,162;welcome at such exclusive affairs.
224;00:15:19,196;00:15:21,998;— Oh, to be foreign.
224;00:15:19,196;00:15:21,998;— Ahem.
225;00:15:22,032;00:15:24,167;Shae has been noticed.
226;00:15:24,201;00:15:25,702;Sansa's maid saw you with her.
227;00:15:25,704;00:15:27,420;She already told your sister.
228;00:15:27,504;00:15:29,706;It's only a matter of time
228;00:15:27,504;00:15:29,706;before your father hears.
229;00:15:29,708;00:15:32,876;So I'm guilty of being seen
229;00:15:29,708;00:15:32,876;with my own wife's handmaiden.
230;00:15:32,927;00:15:34,711;My father will ask you
230;00:15:32,927;00:15:34,711;if there's anything more
231;00:15:34,713;00:15:36,379;and you'll tell him
231;00:15:34,713;00:15:36,379;some clever lie.
232;00:15:36,430;00:15:38,131;No, I will not.
233;00:15:38,182;00:15:41,434;How long do you imagine your father
233;00:15:38,182;00:15:41,434;and sister would let me live
234;00:15:41,468;00:15:43,803;if they suspected me of lying?
235;00:15:43,854;00:15:46,222;I have no pet sellsword
235;00:15:43,854;00:15:46,222;to protect me.
236;00:15:46,273;00:15:48,308;No legendary brother
236;00:15:46,273;00:15:48,308;to avenge me.
237;00:15:48,359;00:15:50,777;Only little birds
237;00:15:48,359;00:15:50,777;who whisper in my ear.
238;00:15:50,811;00:15:52,595;Forgive me
238;00:15:50,811;00:15:52,595;if I don't weep for you.
239;00:15:52,630;00:15:55,648;No one weeps
239;00:15:52,630;00:15:55,648;for spiders or whores.
240;00:15:55,699;00:15:58,818;I have friends across
240;00:15:55,699;00:15:58,818;the sea who could help her.
241;00:15:58,869;00:16:00,370;She won't leave.
242;00:16:00,404;00:16:01,654;I've told her this is
242;00:16:00,404;00:16:01,654;a dangerous place
243;00:16:01,705;00:16:03,573;so many times,
243;00:16:01,705;00:16:03,573;she no longer believes it.
244;00:16:03,624;00:16:06,576;Your father has promised to hang
244;00:16:03,624;00:16:06,576;the next whore he finds you with.
245;00:16:06,627;00:16:10,163;Have you ever known your
245;00:16:06,627;00:16:10,163;father to make an idle threat?
246;00:16:13,217;00:16:15,385;From House Tyrell and the
246;00:16:13,217;00:16:15,385;people of the Reach,
247;00:16:15,419;00:16:19,589;Your Grace, it is my honor to
247;00:16:15,419;00:16:19,589;present you with this wedding cup.
248;00:16:19,640;00:16:22,175;May you and my daughter Margaery
249;00:16:22,226;00:16:24,010;drink deep and live long.
250;00:16:24,061;00:16:26,429;A handsome goblet, my lord.
251;00:16:26,480;00:16:29,098;Or shall I call you Father?
252;00:16:29,149;00:16:31,684;I shall be honored, Your Grace.
253;00:16:39,026;00:16:41,427;She's the whore
253;00:16:39,026;00:16:41,427;I told you about.
254;00:16:41,462;00:16:43,279;The dark-haired one.
255;00:16:44,949;00:16:47,951;Have her brought to the Tower
255;00:16:44,949;00:16:47,951;of the Hand before the wedding.
256;00:16:58,462;00:16:59,796;A book?
257;00:16:59,798;00:17:02,265;«The Lives of Four Kings.»
257;00:16:59,798;00:17:02,265;Grand Maester Kaeth's history

260;00:17:09,139;00:17:10,807;A book every king should read.
261;00:17:19,984;00:17:21,985;Now that the war is won,
262;00:17:22,036;00:17:25,204;we should all find
262;00:17:22,036;00:17:25,204;time for wisdom.
263;00:17:26,290;00:17:28,491;Thank you, Uncle.

267;00:18:03,544;00:18:05,828;So they say.

540;00:37:08,504;00:37:09,921;I'm no lady, Your Grace.
541;00:37:09,972;00:37:12,340;Did you just bow?
542;00:37:12,391;00:37:13,842;Apologies, Your Grace.
543;00:37:13,893;00:37:16,645;I never did master the curtsy.
544;00:37:16,679;00:37:18,263;You're the one who put a sword
544;00:37:16,679;00:37:18,263;through Renly Baratheon.
545;00:37:18,314;00:37:21,266;That's not true, my love. Brienne
545;00:37:18,314;00:37:21,266;had nothing to do with it.
546;00:37:21,317;00:37:23,018;A shame.
547;00:37:23,020;00:37:25,687;I'd knight the man that put an

548;00:37:26,856;00:37:28,990;I just wanted
548;00:37:26,856;00:37:28,990;to congratulate you both
549;00:37:29,025;00:37:30,375;and wish you good fortune.
550;00:37:30,409;00:37:32,327;The country has been
550;00:37:30,409;00:37:32,327;at war too long.
551;00:37:32,361;00:37:35,580;I hope your reign
551;00:37:32,361;00:37:35,580;is long and peaceful.
552;00:37:35,615;00:37:37,432;— Yes, yes.
552;00:37:35,615;00:37:37,432;— Thank you.
553;00:37:37,466;00:37:39,651;I hope we see more of you.

556;00:37:51,381;00:37:54,382;That makes you a lady whether
556;00:37:51,381;00:37:54,382;you want to be or not.
557;00:37:54,384;00:37:56,685;As you say, Your Grace.
558;00:37:56,719;00:37:58,136;I owe you my gratitude.

563;00:38:10,283;00:38:11,900;Haven't heard that story before.
564;00:38:13,486;00:38:16,071;Not such a fascinating

565;00:38:16,122;00:38:18,490;I'm sure you have many
565;00:38:16,122;00:38:18,490;fascinating stories.

566;00:38:18,541;00:38:22,644;Catelyn Stark. And now my brother.
567;00:38:22,678;00:38:26,164;Must be exciting to flit
567;00:38:22,678;00:38:26,164;from one camp to the next
568;00:38:26,215;00:38:28,967;serving whichever lord
568;00:38:26,215;00:38:28,967;or lady you fancy.
569;00:38:29,001;00:38:31,553;I don't serve

570;00:38:31,587;00:38:33,722;But you love him.
571;00:38:41,764;00:38:43,682;Your Grace.
572;00:38:54,243;00:38:58,280;No, no, come to my chambers and
572;00:38:54,243;00:38:58,280;I will examine you personally.
573;00:38:58,282;00:39:00,582;— She'll do no such thing.
573;00:38:58,282;00:39:00,582;— Oh, Your Grace.
574;00:39:00,616;00:39:02,784;Yes, well, this young
574;00:39:00,616;00:39:02,784;lady sought my advice–
575;00:39:02,786;00:39:04,502;You should see Qyburn.
575;00:39:02,786;00:39:04,502;He's quite good.
576;00:39:04,537;00:39:07,622;— Your Grace.
576;00:39:04,537;00:39:07,622;— Qyburn? Deplorable man.
577;00:39:07,673;00:39:11,092;Brought shame on the Citadel
577;00:39:07,673;00:39:11,092;with his repugnant experiments.
578;00:39:11,127;00:39:13,461;More repugnant than your gnarled

579;00:39:13,463;00:39:15,847;Your Grace,
579;00:39:13,463;00:39:15,847;I am a man of learning.
580;00:39:15,881;00:39:18,683;My little brother had you sent to the

581;00:39:18,718;00:39:20,802;What do you think I could do
581;00:39:18,718;00:39:20,802;to you if you annoyed me?
582;00:39:20,804;00:39:22,804;I never meant to annoy anyone.
583;00:39:22,806;00:39:25,724;But you are.
583;00:39:22,806;00:39:25,724;You annoy me right now.
584;00:39:25,775;00:39:27,942;Every breath you draw
584;00:39:25,775;00:39:27,942;in my presence annoys me.
585;00:39:27,977;00:39:29,477;So here's what I want you to do.
586;00:39:29,479;00:39:31,029;I want you to leave my presence.
587;00:39:31,063;00:39:32,480;Leave this wedding right now.

588;00:39:32,531;00:39:34,149;and instruct them

589;00:39:34,200;00:39:37,652;will be brought to the kennels.
