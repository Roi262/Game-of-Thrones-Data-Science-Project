2;00:02:06,304;00:02:08,970;We shouldn't be out here alone.
2;00:02:06,304;00:02:08,970;Why not?
3;00:02:08,971;00:02:11,678;If your father--
3;00:02:08,971;00:02:11,678;He'll never know we're gone.
4;00:02:11,679;00:02:13,746;But if he finds out...
5;00:02:17,638;00:02:20,263;You don't need
5;00:02:17,638;00:02:20,263;to be afraid of my father.
6;00:02:47,388;00:02:49,803;Are you sure?
7;00:02:49,804;00:02:51,595;Yes.
8;00:02:51,596;00:02:54,804;We shouldn't go in.
8;00:02:51,596;00:02:54,804;Of course we should.
9;00:03:39,013;00:03:42,262;Get out.
9;00:03:39,013;00:03:42,262;Get out!
10;00:03:42,263;00:03:44,220;Let's go.
10;00:03:42,263;00:03:44,220;No.
11;00:03:44,221;00:03:45,996;Listen to your friend.
12;00:03:47,346;00:03:49,053;They said that you
12;00:03:47,346;00:03:49,053;were terrifying
13;00:03:49,054;00:03:53,137;with cat's teeth and three eyes.
14;00:03:53,138;00:03:55,013;You're not terrifying.
15;00:03:55,679;00:03:58,512;You're boring.
16;00:03:58,513;00:04:00,614;You don't know what I am.
17;00:04:00,734;00:04:04,132;I know you're a witch
17;00:04:00,734;00:04:04,132;and you can see the future.
18;00:04:05,513;00:04:07,428;Tell me mine.
19;00:04:07,429;00:04:09,720;Everyone wants
19;00:04:07,429;00:04:09,720;to know their future
20;00:04:09,721;00:04:11,845;until they know their future.
21;00:04:11,846;00:04:15,220;This is my father's land.
21;00:04:11,846;00:04:15,220;My land.
22;00:04:15,221;00:04:20,265;Tell me my future or I'll have your two
22;00:04:15,221;00:04:20,265;boring eyes gouged out of your head.
23;00:04:29,903;00:04:32,512;Your blood.
24;00:04:32,513;00:04:34,054;Give me a taste.
25;00:04:59,388;00:05:01,335;Three questions you get.
26;00:05:01,896;00:05:04,346;You won't like the answers.
27;00:05:08,013;00:05:10,720;I've been promised
27;00:05:08,013;00:05:10,720;to the prince.
28;00:05:10,721;00:05:13,845;When will we marry?
29;00:05:13,846;00:05:15,521;You will never wed the prince.
30;00:05:15,758;00:05:17,512;You will wed the king.
31;00:05:17,513;00:05:18,970;But I will be queen?
32;00:05:18,971;00:05:21,387;Oh, yes.
33;00:05:21,388;00:05:23,720;You'll be queen.
34;00:05:23,721;00:05:25,595;For a time.
35;00:05:25,596;00:05:28,678;Then comes another,
36;00:05:28,679;00:05:30,178;younger,
37;00:05:30,179;00:05:32,803;more beautiful,
38;00:05:32,804;00:05:36,095;to cast you down
38;00:05:32,804;00:05:36,095;and take all you hold dear.
39;00:05:36,096;00:05:39,303;W-will the king and I
39;00:05:36,096;00:05:39,303;have children?
40;00:05:39,304;00:05:44,699;No. The king will have 20
40;00:05:39,304;00:05:44,699;children and you will have three.
41;00:05:44,819;00:05:45,803;That doesn't make sense.
42;00:05:45,804;00:05:49,262;Gold will be their crowns.
43;00:05:49,263;00:05:52,138;Gold their shrouds.
44;00:05:59,429;00:06:00,970;Come on, we have to go.
45;00:06:01,763;00:06:04,428;We have to go!
45;00:06:01,763;00:06:04,428;Cersei!
46;00:06:08,388;00:06:10,387;Bearers, put it down.
47;00:06:25,721;00:06:29,095;Bearers, up.
48;00:06:29,096;00:06:30,846;Away.
49;00:06:44,513;00:06:47,262;Your Grace, we are
49;00:06:44,513;00:06:47,262;honored by your presence.
50;00:06:47,263;00:06:48,678;The mourners are waiting.
51;00:06:48,798;00:06:51,193;They will keep waiting.
52;00:06:51,297;00:06:53,046;I want a moment alone with him.
53;00:06:53,047;00:06:55,505;But, Your Grace, many of these lords
53;00:06:53,047;00:06:55,505;and ladies have travelled
54;00:06:55,506;00:06:57,671;day and night to be here from
54;00:06:55,506;00:06:57,671;all seven kingdoms.
55;00:06:57,672;00:06:59,422;They will wait.
56;00:07:26,672;00:07:28,796;He never wanted you
56;00:07:26,672;00:07:28,796;to be a Kingsguard,
57;00:07:28,797;00:07:32,547;but here you are,
57;00:07:28,797;00:07:32,547;protecting his dead body.
58;00:07:34,381;00:07:38,297;What he built, it's ours.
59;00:07:39,506;00:07:42,422;He built it for us.
59;00:07:39,506;00:07:42,422;He meant it for us.
60;00:07:44,672;00:07:46,171;They're going to try
60;00:07:44,672;00:07:46,171;to take it away.
61;00:07:46,172;00:07:47,546;All of it.
61;00:07:46,172;00:07:47,546;They?
62;00:07:47,547;00:07:49,255;All of them out there,
62;00:07:47,547;00:07:49,255;our enemies.
63;00:07:49,256;00:07:52,046;They're waiting in line to make sure
63;00:07:49,256;00:07:52,046;he's really dead.
64;00:07:52,047;00:07:54,838;And as soon as they see
64;00:07:52,047;00:07:54,838;the stones on his eyes,
65;00:07:54,839;00:07:56,671;they'll set to work
65;00:07:54,839;00:07:56,671;on tearing us apart.
66;00:07:56,672;00:07:59,421;They have nothing to do with it.
67;00:07:59,422;00:08:01,713;The man who murdered our father,
67;00:07:59,422;00:08:01,713;he tore us apart.
68;00:08:01,714;00:08:04,046;He's the enemy.
68;00:08:01,714;00:08:04,046;I've been telling you for years.
69;00:08:04,047;00:08:05,088;You've been defending
69;00:08:04,047;00:08:05,088;him for years.
70;00:08:05,089;00:08:07,255;This is exactly what they want.
71;00:08:07,256;00:08:08,880;And now our father is dead
72;00:08:08,881;00:08:12,339;and that little monster
72;00:08:08,881;00:08:12,339;is out there somewhere drawing breath.
73;00:08:14,464;00:08:16,631;Did you set him free?
74;00:08:19,256;00:08:20,963;Tyrion may be a monster,
75;00:08:20,964;00:08:24,963;but at least he killed
75;00:08:20,964;00:08:24,963;our father on purpose.
76;00:08:24,964;00:08:27,088;You killed him by mistake.
77;00:08:27,089;00:08:28,881;With stupidity.
78;00:08:30,381;00:08:31,796;You're a man
78;00:08:30,381;00:08:31,796;of action, aren't you?
79;00:08:31,797;00:08:34,338;When it occurs to you
79;00:08:31,797;00:08:34,338;to do something, you do it.
80;00:08:34,339;00:08:37,339;Never mind the consequences.
81;00:08:39,297;00:08:42,005;Take a look.
82;00:08:42,006;00:08:43,006;Look at the consequences.
83;00:08:46,006;00:08:47,839;Here they are.
84;00:08:51,714;00:08:55,006;He loved you more than
84;00:08:51,714;00:08:55,006;anyone in this world.
85;00:10:27,256;00:10:29,089;Apologies.
86;00:10:39,089;00:10:42,463;I still don't see
86;00:10:39,089;00:10:42,463;why I had to stay
87;00:10:42,464;00:10:44,546;in this fucking crate
87;00:10:42,464;00:10:44,546;once we set sail.
88;00:10:44,547;00:10:47,463;I saved your life.
89;00:10:47,464;00:10:50,213;If they catch you,
89;00:10:47,464;00:10:50,213;they catch me.
90;00:10:50,214;00:10:52,255;I cannot say
90;00:10:50,214;00:10:52,255;I feel overly guilty
91;00:10:52,256;00:10:54,338;about leaving you
91;00:10:52,256;00:10:54,338;in that fucking crate.
92;00:10:54,339;00:10:57,046;Do you know what it's like
92;00:10:54,339;00:10:57,046;to stuff your shit
93;00:10:57,047;00:10:58,713;through one of those airholes?
94;00:10:58,714;00:11:00,005;No, I only know what it's like
95;00:11:00,006;00:11:03,172;to pick up your shit
95;00:11:00,006;00:11:03,172;and throw it overboard.
96;00:11:06,506;00:11:08,796;Pentos?
97;00:11:08,797;00:11:11,255;The home of my colleague
97;00:11:08,797;00:11:11,255;Illyrio Mopatis,
98;00:11:11,256;00:11:13,630;a merchant.
99;00:11:13,631;00:11:15,588;He and I met many years ago
100;00:11:15,589;00:11:17,005;through mutual friends.
101;00:11:17,006;00:11:20,380;A group of people
101;00:11:17,006;00:11:20,380;who saw Robert Baratheon
102;00:11:20,381;00:11:21,838;for the disaster he was.
103;00:11:21,839;00:11:24,880;We tried to do what
103;00:11:21,839;00:11:24,880;was best for the realm
104;00:11:24,881;00:11:28,421;by supporting
104;00:11:24,881;00:11:28,421;a Targaryen restoration.
105;00:11:28,422;00:11:31,046;And thus began
105;00:11:28,422;00:11:31,046;the chain of mistakes
106;00:11:31,047;00:11:33,671;that has led us both here.
107;00:11:33,672;00:11:37,130;Things have gotten worse,
107;00:11:33,672;00:11:37,130;not better.
108;00:11:37,131;00:11:40,214;Westeros needs to be
108;00:11:37,131;00:11:40,214;saved from itself.
109;00:11:43,964;00:11:45,838;Mmm.
110;00:11:45,839;00:11:47,296;Much better.
111;00:11:47,297;00:11:48,964;My lord?
112;00:11:51,006;00:11:53,838;I don't think I am anymore.
113;00:11:53,839;00:11:56,047;A lord.
114;00:12:03,881;00:12:05,839;Are you a lord
114;00:12:03,881;00:12:05,839;if you kill your father?
115;00:12:08,214;00:12:11,880;I don't imagine
115;00:12:08,214;00:12:11,880;they revoke your nobility
116;00:12:11,881;00:12:13,838;for killing a whore.
117;00:12:13,839;00:12:15,755;It must happen all the time.
118;00:12:15,756;00:12:18,171;You already drank yourself
118;00:12:15,756;00:12:18,171;across the Narrow Sea.
119;00:12:18,172;00:12:19,755;In a box.
119;00:12:18,172;00:12:19,755;Why stop now?
120;00:12:19,756;00:12:23,172;Because we are talking
120;00:12:19,756;00:12:23,172;about the future of our country.
121;00:12:27,047;00:12:29,756;The future is shit.
122;00:12:31,964;00:12:33,839;Just like the past.
123;00:14:25,886;00:14:27,218;_
124;00:14:27,338;00:14:29,692;_

128;00:14:54,006;00:14:55,213;Shh.
129;00:14:55,214;00:14:56,922;Shh.
130;00:15:41,422;00:15:43,213;The Sons of the Harpy?
131;00:15:43,214;00:15:45,546;Yes, Your Grace.
131;00:15:43,214;00:15:45,546;They left it on the body.
132;00:15:45,547;00:15:46,880;They've never killed before.
133;00:15:46,881;00:15:49,380;It was only a matter
133;00:15:46,881;00:15:49,380;of time, Your Grace.
134;00:15:49,381;00:15:51,880;Conquerors always meet
134;00:15:49,381;00:15:51,880;with resistance.
135;00:15:51,881;00:15:53,963;I didn't conquer them.
135;00:15:51,881;00:15:53,963;Their own people did.
136;00:15:54,374;00:15:57,841;_

138;00:16:02,297;00:16:05,046;He did not risk his life
138;00:16:02,297;00:16:05,046;fighting for his freedom
139;00:16:05,047;00:16:07,046;so cowards in masks
139;00:16:05,047;00:16:07,046;could take it away.
140;00:16:07,047;00:16:08,546;And I did not take up
140;00:16:07,047;00:16:08,546;residence in this pyramid
141;00:16:08,547;00:16:12,005;so I could watch the city below
141;00:16:08,547;00:16:12,005;decline into chaos.
142;00:16:12,006;00:16:14,546;What was the name
142;00:16:12,006;00:16:14,546;of the man you lost?
143;00:16:14,547;00:16:18,005;White Rat, Your Grace.
144;00:16:18,006;00:16:22,171;I want him buried
144;00:16:18,006;00:16:22,171;with honor, publically
145;00:16:22,172;00:16:24,588;in the Temple of the Graces.
146;00:16:24,589;00:16:26,630;The Sons of the Harpy
146;00:16:24,589;00:16:26,630;will hear that message.
147;00:16:26,631;00:16:28,338;Make them very angry.
148;00:16:28,339;00:16:30,296;Angry snakes lash out.
149;00:16:30,297;00:16:33,005;Makes chopping off their heads
149;00:16:30,297;00:16:33,005;that much easier.
150;00:16:33,006;00:16:36,422;Find the men who did this
150;00:16:33,006;00:16:36,422;and bring them to me.
151;00:16:39,797;00:16:40,797;Your Grace.
152;00:16:55,297;00:16:57,296;Torgo Nudho.
153;00:16:57,297;00:16:59,172;Missandei hin Naath.
154;00:17:01,464;00:17:02,756;I wanted to speak with you.
155;00:17:11,589;00:17:13,921;Why do you come?
156;00:17:13,922;00:17:16,881;White Rat, the Unsullied who...
157;00:17:19,172;00:17:22,381;I have heard they found
157;00:17:19,172;00:17:22,381;his body in a brothel.
158;00:17:23,631;00:17:26,546;I have heard that
158;00:17:23,631;00:17:26,546;more than one Unsullied
159;00:17:26,547;00:17:29,214;has been known to visit
159;00:17:26,547;00:17:29,214;Meereen's brothels.
160;00:17:32,214;00:17:33,714;May I ask you why?
161;00:17:35,464;00:17:37,797;Why would an Unsullied
161;00:17:35,464;00:17:37,797;go to a brothel?
162;00:17:41,381;00:17:44,297;I do not know.
163;00:17:45,214;00:17:47,839;I must go.
164;00:18:02,922;00:18:05,046;Get your shield up.
164;00:18:02,922;00:18:05,046;It's too heavy.
165;00:18:05,047;00:18:07,338;If it wasn't heavy,
165;00:18:05,047;00:18:07,338;it wouldn't stop a sword.
166;00:18:07,339;00:18:08,881;Now get it up.
167;00:18:20,547;00:18:24,046;Come.
167;00:18:20,547;00:18:24,046;Try it again.
168;00:18:24,047;00:18:27,171;Drive at me.
168;00:18:24,047;00:18:27,171;Keep your shield up.
169;00:18:27,172;00:18:29,630;Or I'll ring
169;00:18:27,172;00:18:29,630;your head like a bell.
170;00:18:29,631;00:18:32,421;Shouldn't you be training, too?
171;00:18:32,422;00:18:34,922;Well, I'm hardly a new recruit.
172;00:18:38,214;00:18:40,755;How many brothers can say that they've
172;00:18:38,214;00:18:40,755;killed a white walker and a Thenn?
173;00:18:40,756;00:18:43,880;I might be the first in history.
174;00:18:43,881;00:18:45,796;- Shield up.
174;00:18:43,881;00:18:45,796;- These men need a firm hand.
175;00:18:45,797;00:18:47,546;Always have.
176;00:18:47,547;00:18:49,714;They're poachers and thieves.
177;00:18:52,381;00:18:54,297;Not soldiers.
178;00:19:00,131;00:19:01,881;That one hates me.
179;00:19:04,006;00:19:06,213;If Ser Alliser
179;00:19:04,006;00:19:06,213;is chosen as the new Lord Commander...
180;00:19:06,214;00:19:09,880;He hates the wildlings.
181;00:19:09,881;00:19:11,671;All the wildlings.
182;00:19:11,672;00:19:14,255;Don't let them send us away.
182;00:19:11,672;00:19:14,255;It's not a sure thing.
183;00:19:14,256;00:19:16,796;Ser Denys Mallister has
183;00:19:14,256;00:19:16,796;commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years
184;00:19:16,797;00:19:18,630;and people say he's a good man.
185;00:19:18,631;00:19:19,755;He's running against
185;00:19:18,631;00:19:19,755;Ser Alliser--
186;00:19:19,756;00:19:22,380;Sam, don't let them
186;00:19:19,756;00:19:22,380;send us away.
187;00:19:22,381;00:19:23,630;I told you.
188;00:19:23,631;00:19:26,755;Wherever you go, I go, too.
189;00:19:26,756;00:19:29,047;You can't leave.
189;00:19:26,756;00:19:29,047;They'll execute you.
190;00:19:37,047;00:19:39,007;Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot.
190;00:19:37,047;00:19:39,007;Yah!
191;00:19:40,672;00:19:41,756;Shield up.
192;00:19:44,339;00:19:46,214;The king wants a word.
193;00:20:13,672;00:20:15,838;You're not cold, my lady?
194;00:20:15,839;00:20:18,005;Never.
195;00:20:18,006;00:20:22,006;The Lord's fire lives
195;00:20:18,006;00:20:22,006;within me, Jon Snow.
196;00:20:24,756;00:20:26,547;Feel.
197;00:20:33,797;00:20:35,631;Are you a virgin?
198;00:20:39,089;00:20:41,172;No.
199;00:20:42,756;00:20:44,631;Good.
200;00:20:51,339;00:20:53,796;Your Grace.
201;00:20:53,797;00:20:56,006;The bastard of Winterfell.
202;00:21:03,797;00:21:06,839;You know who rules
202;00:21:03,797;00:21:06,839;at Winterfell now?
203;00:21:08,006;00:21:09,796;Roose Bolton.
204;00:21:09,797;00:21:13,089;Mmm, the traitor who plunged a dagger
204;00:21:09,797;00:21:13,089;in Robb Stark's heart.
205;00:21:14,047;00:21:16,631;Don't you want to avenge him?
206;00:21:17,964;00:21:20,963;I want a great
206;00:21:17,964;00:21:20,963;many things, Your Grace.
207;00:21:20,964;00:21:23,463;But I'm a sworn brother
207;00:21:20,964;00:21:23,463;of the Night's Watch now.
208;00:21:23,464;00:21:26,796;I've been talking
208;00:21:23,464;00:21:26,796;to your sworn brothers.
209;00:21:26,797;00:21:28,505;Many of them love you.
209;00:21:26,797;00:21:28,505;They're good men.
210;00:21:28,506;00:21:30,213;Many don't.
211;00:21:30,214;00:21:34,213;You were seen taking the body
211;00:21:30,214;00:21:34,213;of a wildling girl north of the Wall.
212;00:21:34,214;00:21:35,880;Why?
213;00:21:35,881;00:21:37,088;It's where she belonged.
214;00:21:37,089;00:21:39,505;Some of the Night's
214;00:21:37,089;00:21:39,505;Watch feel you have
215;00:21:39,506;00:21:41,463;too much affection
215;00:21:39,506;00:21:41,463;for the wildlings.
216;00:21:41,464;00:21:43,880;They were born on the
216;00:21:41,464;00:21:43,880;wrong side of the Wall.
217;00:21:43,881;00:21:45,921;That doesn't make them monsters.
218;00:21:45,922;00:21:47,213;No matter.
219;00:21:47,214;00:21:48,213;I shall take back the North
220;00:21:48,214;00:21:50,130;from the thieves who stole it.
221;00:21:50,131;00:21:52,713;Tywin Lannister is dead.
221;00:21:50,131;00:21:52,713;He can't protect them now.
222;00:21:52,714;00:21:56,296;I shall mount Roose Bolton's
222;00:21:52,714;00:21:56,296;head on a spike.
223;00:21:56,297;00:21:59,005;But if I'm to take Winterfell,
223;00:21:56,297;00:21:59,005;I need more men.
224;00:21:59,006;00:22:01,005;The men of the Night's Watch
224;00:21:59,006;00:22:01,005;are sworn to play no part--
225;00:22:01,006;00:22:04,005;I'm not talking about
225;00:22:01,006;00:22:04,005;the damn Night's Watch.
226;00:22:04,006;00:22:05,756;I'm talking about the wildlings.
227;00:22:13,756;00:22:17,880;Your Grace,
227;00:22:13,756;00:22:17,880;you want the wildlings
228;00:22:17,881;00:22:19,880;to march in your army?
229;00:22:19,881;00:22:21,171;If they swear to follow me,
229;00:22:19,881;00:22:21,171;I'll pardon them.
230;00:22:21,172;00:22:23,755;We'll take Winterfell.
230;00:22:21,172;00:22:23,755;Once the North is won,
231;00:22:23,756;00:22:24,671;I'll declare them
231;00:22:23,756;00:22:24,671;citizens of the realm.
232;00:22:24,672;00:22:26,880;I'll give them land to live on.
233;00:22:26,881;00:22:31,046;It's a fair offer.
233;00:22:26,881;00:22:31,046;More than fair.
234;00:22:31,047;00:22:33,005;I'll offer them their lives
234;00:22:31,047;00:22:33,005;and their freedom
235;00:22:33,006;00:22:36,046;if Mance kneels before me
235;00:22:33,006;00:22:36,046;and swears his loyalty.
236;00:22:36,047;00:22:37,168;I don't think that's likely.
237;00:22:40,006;00:22:41,421;You admire him, don't you?
238;00:22:41,422;00:22:44,171;I respect him.
238;00:22:41,422;00:22:44,171;He likes you.
239;00:22:44,172;00:22:46,088;Convince him to bend the knee...
239;00:22:44,172;00:22:46,088;Your Grace.
240;00:22:46,089;00:22:47,422;...or he burns.
241;00:22:51,339;00:22:52,796;How much time do I have?
242;00:22:52,797;00:22:54,463;Nightfall.
243;00:22:54,464;00:22:56,755;The sun drops fast
243;00:22:54,464;00:22:56,755;this time of year.
244;00:22:56,756;00:22:58,421;Hurry, Jon Snow.
245;00:23:02,047;00:23:03,630;Shield up.
246;00:23:03,631;00:23:06,463;Attack, my lord!
247;00:23:06,464;00:23:07,838;Attack!
248;00:23:07,839;00:23:11,463;Don't cross your feet.
249;00:23:11,464;00:23:13,213;My sons had swords
249;00:23:11,464;00:23:13,213;in their hands
250;00:23:13,214;00:23:14,838;from the time they could walk.
250;00:23:13,214;00:23:14,838;This one...
251;00:23:14,839;00:23:17,005;Lord Arryn will never
251;00:23:14,839;00:23:17,005;be a great warrior.
252;00:23:17,006;00:23:19,005;Great warrior?
253;00:23:19,006;00:23:21,630;He swings a sword
253;00:23:19,006;00:23:21,630;like a girl with palsy.
254;00:23:21,631;00:23:24,546;My lord.
255;00:23:24,547;00:23:26,421;Sword up, my lord!
256;00:23:33,922;00:23:35,796;Some boys develop more slowly.
257;00:23:35,797;00:23:38,088;He's still young.
258;00:23:38,089;00:23:41,213;He's 13.
258;00:23:38,089;00:23:41,213;Boys go to war at 13.
259;00:23:41,214;00:23:43,255;He has other gifts.
259;00:23:41,214;00:23:43,255;Does he?
260;00:23:43,256;00:23:46,046;The gift of a great name.
261;00:23:46,047;00:23:49,796;Sometimes that's all one needs.
262;00:23:54,756;00:23:57,505;Good-bye, Lord Royce, and thank you
262;00:23:54,756;00:23:57,505;for all you've done for me.
263;00:23:57,506;00:23:59,921;I have done nothing more
263;00:23:57,506;00:23:59,921;than my duty, my lady.
264;00:23:59,922;00:24:01,255;I have no doubt
264;00:23:59,922;00:24:01,255;that on my return,
265;00:24:01,256;00:24:04,213;Robin's skills will have
265;00:24:01,256;00:24:04,213;improved immeasurably.
266;00:24:04,214;00:24:05,380;He'll be safe here.
267;00:24:05,381;00:24:09,338;As for his skills,
268;00:24:09,339;00:24:11,547;I make no promises.
269;00:24:24,506;00:24:27,713;Will we head north
269;00:24:24,506;00:24:27,713;at some point?
270;00:24:27,714;00:24:31,005;He said Sansa had a brother
270;00:24:27,714;00:24:31,005;at Castle Black.
271;00:24:31,006;00:24:32,630;We're a few days' ride
271;00:24:31,006;00:24:32,630;from the Kingsroad.
272;00:24:32,631;00:24:35,714;But that will take us--
272;00:24:32,631;00:24:35,714;Us?
273;00:24:37,964;00:24:40,255;The only reason you're here
273;00:24:37,964;00:24:40,255;is because Jaime Lannister
274;00:24:40,256;00:24:41,922;told me you weren't
274;00:24:40,256;00:24:41,922;safe in the capital.
275;00:24:44,047;00:24:47,005;You're hundreds of miles
275;00:24:44,047;00:24:47,005;from King's Landing.
276;00:24:47,006;00:24:49,005;No one knows what you look like.
277;00:24:49,006;00:24:51,421;No one cares.
277;00:24:49,006;00:24:51,421;You're safe.
278;00:24:51,422;00:24:54,922;But I'm your squire.
278;00:24:51,422;00:24:54,922;Do you even know what a squire is?
279;00:24:56,714;00:24:57,505;An attendant to a knight.
280;00:24:57,506;00:25:00,130;I'm not a knight.
281;00:25:00,131;00:25:02,380;That means you're not a squire.
282;00:25:02,381;00:25:03,463;Well, where would I go?
283;00:25:03,464;00:25:06,339;I don't care.
283;00:25:03,464;00:25:06,339;I'm not your mother.
284;00:25:15,006;00:25:17,130;You swore to find
284;00:25:15,006;00:25:17,130;the Stark girls.
285;00:25:17,131;00:25:19,921;I found Arya. She didn't want
285;00:25:17,131;00:25:19,921;my protection.
286;00:25:19,922;00:25:22,131;Sansa still might.
286;00:25:19,922;00:25:22,131;Will you shut your mouth?
287;00:25:23,297;00:25:25,131;I didn't ask for your advice.
288;00:25:26,964;00:25:29,796;I don't want anyone
288;00:25:26,964;00:25:29,796;following me.
289;00:25:29,797;00:25:31,713;I'm not a leader.
290;00:25:31,714;00:25:34,713;All I ever wanted
290;00:25:31,714;00:25:34,713;was to fight for a lord I believed in.
291;00:25:34,714;00:25:37,631;The good lords are dead
291;00:25:34,714;00:25:37,631;and the rest are monsters.
292;00:25:48,631;00:25:50,880;You told Lord Royce
292;00:25:48,631;00:25:50,880;we were going to the Fingers.
293;00:25:50,881;00:25:53,088;I did.
294;00:25:53,089;00:25:56,213;But we're heading west.
294;00:25:53,089;00:25:56,213;We are.
295;00:25:56,214;00:25:58,172;If he wanted to betray us,
295;00:25:56,214;00:25:58,172;he already would have.
296;00:25:59,714;00:26:03,463;Lord Royce might be as honorable
296;00:25:59,714;00:26:03,463;as he thinks he is,
297;00:26:03,464;00:26:05,838;but he's not alone
297;00:26:03,464;00:26:05,838;in that castle.
298;00:26:05,839;00:26:06,921;Do you trust all those
298;00:26:05,839;00:26:06,921;knights and ladies,
299;00:26:06,922;00:26:10,130;stable boys and serving girls?
300;00:26:10,131;00:26:13,088;No, do you trust the carriage driver
300;00:26:10,131;00:26:13,088;or the knights escorting us?
301;00:26:13,089;00:26:14,546;No.
302;00:26:14,547;00:26:17,171;But I pay them well
303;00:26:17,172;00:26:19,463;and they've seen what happens
303;00:26:17,172;00:26:19,463;to men who disappoint me.
304;00:26:19,464;00:26:21,838;So where are we going?
305;00:26:21,839;00:26:24,255;To a land where
305;00:26:21,839;00:26:24,255;you trust everyone?
306;00:26:24,256;00:26:27,005;To a land so far from here,
307;00:26:27,006;00:26:28,926;even Cersei Lannister
307;00:26:27,006;00:26:28,926;can't get her hands on you.
308;00:26:37,797;00:26:40,881;It was such a deep,
308;00:26:37,797;00:26:40,881;deep shock to us all.
309;00:26:44,422;00:26:45,588;Your father was a--
310;00:26:45,589;00:26:48,546;a force to be reckoned with.
311;00:26:48,547;00:26:49,755;He truly was.
312;00:26:49,756;00:26:52,921;I wouldn't presume to claim
313;00:26:52,922;00:26:55,255;to have known him
313;00:26:52,922;00:26:55,255;as such, but--
314;00:26:55,256;00:26:58,796;but just being in his presence was enough
314;00:26:55,256;00:26:58,796;to make it so clear
315;00:26:58,797;00:27:00,963;just how formidable
315;00:26:58,797;00:27:00,963;a person you were dealing with.
316;00:27:00,964;00:27:04,338;What a-- what a force
316;00:27:00,964;00:27:04,338;to be reckoned with.
317;00:27:06,881;00:27:09,256;Thank you so much
317;00:27:06,881;00:27:09,256;for your kind words.
318;00:27:13,922;00:27:16,463;Deepest condolences, Your Grace.
319;00:27:16,464;00:27:18,505;This tragedy...
319;00:27:16,464;00:27:18,505;I never trusted Varys.
320;00:27:18,506;00:27:21,547;I often warned...
321;00:27:24,256;00:27:26,381;Your Grace.
322;00:27:29,131;00:27:31,630;Cousin Lancel.
322;00:27:29,131;00:27:31,630;I hardly recognized you.
323;00:27:31,631;00:27:33,921;My deepest sympathies.
324;00:27:33,922;00:27:37,046;I apologize
324;00:27:33,922;00:27:37,046;for my son's appearance.
325;00:27:37,047;00:27:38,168;Uncle, it's quite all right.
326;00:27:41,589;00:27:43,630;They call themselves sparrows.
327;00:27:43,631;00:27:46,338;Bloody fanatics.
328;00:27:46,339;00:27:48,338;Religion has its place,
328;00:27:46,339;00:27:48,338;of course,
329;00:27:48,339;00:27:51,171;but at a certain point...
330;00:27:51,172;00:27:54,130;They never would have come to the capital
330;00:27:51,172;00:27:54,130;when Tywin was alive.
331;00:27:54,131;00:27:55,796;I'm sure he'll grow out of it,
332;00:27:55,797;00:27:57,796;whatever it is.
333;00:27:57,797;00:28:00,339;Excuse me.
333;00:27:57,797;00:28:00,339;Of course.
334;00:28:18,756;00:28:21,463;Your wounds from the Blackwater
334;00:28:18,756;00:28:21,463;seem to have healed.
335;00:28:21,464;00:28:23,839;It wasn't my wounds
335;00:28:21,464;00:28:23,839;that needed healing.
336;00:28:26,547;00:28:29,464;What can I do for you?
337;00:28:30,464;00:28:32,713;You can forgive me.
338;00:28:32,714;00:28:35,546;What could you possibly
338;00:28:32,714;00:28:35,546;have done to warrant my forgiveness?
339;00:28:35,547;00:28:38,255;I led you into the darkness.
340;00:28:38,256;00:28:39,671;I doubt you've ever
340;00:28:38,256;00:28:39,671;led anyone anywhere.
341;00:28:39,672;00:28:42,463;I tempted you into our...
342;00:28:42,464;00:28:45,714;unnatural relations.
343;00:28:47,256;00:28:49,714;And, of course,
343;00:28:47,256;00:28:49,714;there was the king...
344;00:28:51,297;00:28:54,131;his boar hunt.
345;00:28:56,131;00:28:57,214;His wine.
346;00:29:00,881;00:29:02,755;I don't know what
346;00:29:00,881;00:29:02,755;you're talking about.
347;00:29:02,756;00:29:06,006;I'm a different person now.
348;00:29:07,797;00:29:10,546;I've found peace
348;00:29:07,797;00:29:10,546;in the light of the Seven.
349;00:29:10,547;00:29:12,213;You can, too.
350;00:29:12,214;00:29:13,838;They watch over all of us,
351;00:29:13,839;00:29:16,380;ready to dole out mercy
352;00:29:16,381;00:29:17,881;or justice.
353;00:29:20,756;00:29:23,631;Their world is at hand.
354;00:29:26,381;00:29:28,046;I will pray for
354;00:29:26,381;00:29:28,046;your father's soul.
355;00:29:30,631;00:29:34,214;The day Tywin Lannister's
355;00:29:30,631;00:29:34,214;soul needs your help...
356;00:29:43,047;00:29:45,505;It looks like Dorne.
356;00:29:43,047;00:29:45,505;It doesn't.
357;00:29:45,506;00:29:48,421;It does.
358;00:29:48,422;00:29:52,547;That's the--
358;00:29:48,422;00:29:52,547;that's the Sunspear bit right there.
359;00:29:53,756;00:29:55,463;And that's where
359;00:29:53,756;00:29:55,463;the mountains are.
360;00:29:55,464;00:29:58,796;And over here is--
361;00:29:58,797;00:30:01,588;is Sunsnake?
362;00:30:01,589;00:30:02,213;Stonespear?
363;00:30:02,214;00:30:04,713;Sandstone.
364;00:30:04,714;00:30:06,296;Yes.
365;00:30:06,297;00:30:08,713;Yes, Sandstone.
366;00:30:10,131;00:30:11,463;Just there.
367;00:30:11,464;00:30:13,464;Fine.
368;00:30:16,172;00:30:16,839;It's Dorne.
369;00:30:19,131;00:30:21,338;We should go there.
370;00:30:21,339;00:30:23,713;I think we would
370;00:30:21,339;00:30:23,713;have a lovely time,
371;00:30:23,714;00:30:26,088;judging by my experience.
372;00:30:26,089;00:30:30,838;That would be wonderful.
372;00:30:26,089;00:30:30,838;Dorne, Highgarden.
373;00:30:30,839;00:30:32,381;Anywhere but here.
374;00:30:41,506;00:30:43,422;We're late for dinner as it is.
375;00:30:44,214;00:30:45,838;You're very respectful.
376;00:30:45,839;00:30:46,714;I'm very hungry.
377;00:31:04,381;00:31:07,171;What's your name?
378;00:31:07,172;00:31:08,838;Olyvar, my lady.
379;00:31:08,839;00:31:10,671;I'm afraid my brother
380;00:31:10,672;00:31:14,131;is keeping the king
380;00:31:10,672;00:31:14,131;waiting, Olyvar.
381;00:31:23,006;00:31:24,839;My lady.
382;00:31:37,339;00:31:41,088;Perhaps you might
382;00:31:37,339;00:31:41,088;consider being a bit more discreet?
383;00:31:41,089;00:31:42,838;Why?
384;00:31:42,839;00:31:45,171;They all know about me anyway.
385;00:31:45,172;00:31:48,463;Everybody knows everything
385;00:31:45,172;00:31:48,463;about everyone.
386;00:31:48,464;00:31:51,630;What's the point in trying to
386;00:31:48,464;00:31:51,630;keep a secret in a place like this?
387;00:31:51,631;00:31:54,922;In any event, you shouldn't
387;00:31:51,631;00:31:54,922;keep your intended waiting.
388;00:31:55,631;00:31:58,338;My intended?
388;00:31:55,631;00:31:58,338;Please.
389;00:31:58,339;00:31:59,755;Tywin's dead.
390;00:31:59,756;00:32:02,171;That means no one
390;00:31:59,756;00:32:02,171;can force Cersei to marry me.
391;00:32:02,172;00:32:04,380;Lucky you.
391;00:32:02,172;00:32:04,380;Unlucky you.
392;00:32:04,381;00:32:05,838;You think I want that woman
392;00:32:04,381;00:32:05,838;married to my brother?
393;00:32:05,839;00:32:09,921;If she doesn't marry me,
393;00:32:05,839;00:32:09,921;she doesn't go to Highgarden.
394;00:32:09,922;00:32:12,630;Which means she stays
394;00:32:09,922;00:32:12,630;in King's Landing.
395;00:32:12,631;00:32:15,213;Which means you're trapped here with
395;00:32:12,631;00:32:15,213;Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.
396;00:32:15,214;00:32:16,797;Perhaps.
397;00:32:18,839;00:32:20,880;Perhaps?
398;00:32:20,881;00:32:21,714;Perhaps.
399;00:32:35,422;00:32:39,296;Eunuch, the Spider, the
399;00:32:35,422;00:32:39,296;Master of Whisperers.
400;00:32:39,297;00:32:42,589;Imp, Half-man.
401;00:32:44,922;00:32:47,255;There are faster ways
401;00:32:44,922;00:32:47,255;to kill yourself.
402;00:32:47,256;00:32:49,005;Not for a coward.
403;00:32:49,006;00:32:51,046;You are many things, my friend,
404;00:32:51,047;00:32:52,797;but not a coward.
405;00:32:56,756;00:32:59,130;You never told me
405;00:32:56,756;00:32:59,130;why you set me free.
406;00:32:59,131;00:33:02,130;Your brother asked me to.
407;00:33:02,131;00:33:03,380;Could have said no.
408;00:33:03,381;00:33:06,630;Refuse the Kingslayer?
408;00:33:03,381;00:33:06,630;A dangerous proposition.
409;00:33:06,631;00:33:08,880;Not as dangerous
409;00:33:06,631;00:33:08,880;as releasing me.
410;00:33:08,881;00:33:11,588;You risked your life,
410;00:33:08,881;00:33:11,588;your position, everything.
411;00:33:11,589;00:33:14,255;Why? You're not family.
411;00:33:11,589;00:33:14,255;You owe me nothing.
412;00:33:14,256;00:33:15,838;I didn't do it for you.
413;00:33:15,839;00:33:18,880;I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
414;00:33:18,881;00:33:22,130;A drunken dwarf will never be the savior
414;00:33:18,881;00:33:22,130;of the Seven Kingdoms.
415;00:33:22,131;00:33:24,380;I don't believe in saviors.
416;00:33:24,381;00:33:27,756;I believe men of talent
416;00:33:24,381;00:33:27,756;have a part to play in the war to come.
417;00:33:29,547;00:33:31,171;You're going to have
417;00:33:29,547;00:33:31,171;to find another soldier.
418;00:33:31,172;00:33:35,255;I'm done with Westeros
418;00:33:31,172;00:33:35,255;and Westeros is done with me.
419;00:33:35,256;00:33:38,463;You have many
419;00:33:35,256;00:33:38,463;admirable qualities,
420;00:33:38,464;00:33:39,838;self-pity is not
420;00:33:38,464;00:33:39,838;one of them.
421;00:33:39,839;00:33:42,130;Any fool with a bit of luck
422;00:33:42,131;00:33:45,671;can find himself
422;00:33:42,131;00:33:45,671;born into power.
423;00:33:45,672;00:33:49,338;But earning it for yourself,
423;00:33:45,672;00:33:49,338;that takes work.
424;00:33:49,339;00:33:51,880;I'm not well-suited
424;00:33:49,339;00:33:51,880;for work.
425;00:33:51,881;00:33:53,505;I think you are.
426;00:33:53,506;00:33:55,588;You have your father's
426;00:33:53,506;00:33:55,588;instincts for politics.
427;00:33:55,589;00:33:57,171;And you have compassion.
428;00:33:57,172;00:34:00,380;Compassion? Yes.
429;00:34:00,381;00:34:03,005;I killed my lover
429;00:34:00,381;00:34:03,005;with my bare hands.
430;00:34:03,006;00:34:06,796;I shot my own father
430;00:34:03,006;00:34:06,796;with a crossbow.
431;00:34:06,797;00:34:08,838;I never said you were perfect.
432;00:34:08,839;00:34:12,796;What is it you want exactly?
433;00:34:12,797;00:34:14,796;Peace.
434;00:34:14,797;00:34:16,255;Prosperity.
435;00:34:16,256;00:34:20,338;A land where the powerful
435;00:34:16,256;00:34:20,338;do not prey on the powerless.
436;00:34:20,339;00:34:22,796;Where the castles
436;00:34:20,339;00:34:22,796;are made of gingerbread
437;00:34:22,797;00:34:25,296;and the moats are filled
437;00:34:22,797;00:34:25,296;with blackberry wine.
438;00:34:25,297;00:34:27,588;The powerful have always
438;00:34:25,297;00:34:27,588;preyed on the powerless.
439;00:34:27,589;00:34:30,005;That's how they became powerful
439;00:34:27,589;00:34:30,005;in the first place.
440;00:34:30,006;00:34:31,921;Perhaps.
441;00:34:31,922;00:34:35,505;And perhaps we've grown
441;00:34:31,922;00:34:35,505;so used to horror,
442;00:34:35,506;00:34:37,131;we assume there's no other way.
443;00:34:38,214;00:34:40,921;If you sat on the Iron Throne,
444;00:34:40,922;00:34:43,088;would you spread misery
444;00:34:40,922;00:34:43,088;throughout the land?
445;00:34:43,089;00:34:45,505;I will never sit
445;00:34:43,089;00:34:45,505;on the Iron Throne.
446;00:34:45,506;00:34:47,921;No, you won't.
447;00:34:47,922;00:34:50,296;But you could help another
447;00:34:47,922;00:34:50,296;climb those steps
448;00:34:50,297;00:34:52,796;and take that seat.
449;00:34:52,797;00:34:55,838;The Seven Kingdoms
449;00:34:52,797;00:34:55,838;need someone stronger than Tommen,
450;00:34:55,839;00:34:58,130;but gentler than Stannis.
451;00:34:58,131;00:35:01,046;A monarch who can intimidate the
451;00:34:58,131;00:35:01,046;high lords and inspire the people.
452;00:35:01,047;00:35:05,130;A ruler loved by millions
452;00:35:01,047;00:35:05,130;with a powerful army
453;00:35:05,131;00:35:07,005;and the right family name.
454;00:35:07,006;00:35:09,296;Good luck finding him.
455;00:35:09,297;00:35:12,339;Who said anything about him?
456;00:35:16,297;00:35:18,671;You have a choice, my friend.
457;00:35:18,672;00:35:20,671;You can stay here
457;00:35:18,672;00:35:20,671;at Illyrio's palace
458;00:35:20,672;00:35:23,255;and drink yourself to death,
459;00:35:23,256;00:35:24,588;or you can ride with me
459;00:35:23,256;00:35:24,588;to Meereen,
460;00:35:24,589;00:35:27,046;meet Daenerys Targaryen,
461;00:35:27,047;00:35:29,464;and decide if the world
461;00:35:27,047;00:35:29,464;is worth fighting for.
462;00:35:31,214;00:35:35,547;Can I drink myself to death
462;00:35:31,214;00:35:35,547;on the road to Meereen?
463;00:35:45,589;00:35:49,088;When did the Unsullied
463;00:35:45,589;00:35:49,088;start patrolling the streets of Meereen?
464;00:35:49,089;00:35:51,922;Looks like your friends haven't
464;00:35:49,089;00:35:51,922;been behaving themselves.
465;00:35:54,256;00:35:58,088;Our mission to Yunkai
465;00:35:54,256;00:35:58,088;was a resounding success.
466;00:35:58,089;00:36:00,671;The Wise Masters of Yunkai
466;00:35:58,089;00:36:00,671;have agreed to cede power
467;00:36:00,672;00:36:02,546;to a council of elders
467;00:36:00,672;00:36:02,546;made up of both
468;00:36:02,547;00:36:04,963;the freed men and
468;00:36:02,547;00:36:04,963;the former slaveholders.
469;00:36:04,964;00:36:07,088;All matters of consequence will be
469;00:36:04,964;00:36:07,088;brought to you for review.
470;00:36:07,089;00:36:08,838;Good.
471;00:36:08,839;00:36:11,380;They did ask
471;00:36:08,839;00:36:11,380;for some concessions.
472;00:36:11,381;00:36:13,130;Concessions?
473;00:36:13,131;00:36:16,213;Politics is the art
473;00:36:13,131;00:36:16,213;of compromise, Your Grace.
474;00:36:16,214;00:36:19,130;I'm not a politician.
474;00:36:16,214;00:36:19,130;I'm a queen.
475;00:36:19,131;00:36:22,380;Forgive me.
475;00:36:19,131;00:36:22,380;You're right, of course.
476;00:36:22,381;00:36:26,796;Still, it's easier to rule happy
476;00:36:22,381;00:36:26,796;subjects than angry ones.
477;00:36:26,797;00:36:28,796;I don't expect
477;00:36:26,797;00:36:28,796;the Wise Masters to be happy.
478;00:36:28,797;00:36:31,171;Slavery made them rich.
478;00:36:28,797;00:36:31,171;I ended slavery.
479;00:36:31,172;00:36:34,255;They do not ask
479;00:36:31,172;00:36:34,255;for the return of slavery.
480;00:36:34,256;00:36:36,839;They ask for the reopening
480;00:36:34,256;00:36:36,839;of the fighting pits.
481;00:36:38,756;00:36:40,505;The fighting pits?
482;00:36:40,506;00:36:42,005;Where slaves fought
482;00:36:40,506;00:36:42,005;slaves to the death?
483;00:36:42,006;00:36:44,880;In the new world
483;00:36:42,006;00:36:44,880;that you've brought to us,
484;00:36:44,881;00:36:47,214;free men would fight free men.
485;00:36:48,714;00:36:50,130;The pit fighters you liberated
486;00:36:50,131;00:36:52,213;plead for this opportunity.
487;00:36:52,214;00:36:54,546;Bring some here
487;00:36:52,214;00:36:54,546;and ask them yourself.
488;00:36:54,547;00:36:55,755;No fighting pits.
489;00:36:55,756;00:36:57,088;Opening them would show
489;00:36:55,756;00:36:57,088;the people of Yunkai
490;00:36:57,089;00:37:00,046;and Meereen that you
490;00:36:57,089;00:37:00,046;respect their traditions.
491;00:37:00,047;00:37:02,463;I do not respect the tradition of
491;00:37:00,047;00:37:02,463;human cockfighting.
492;00:37:02,464;00:37:05,714;If you-- - How many times must I say no
492;00:37:02,464;00:37:05,714;before you understand?
493;00:37:08,131;00:37:11,505;Whatever he wants from me,
493;00:37:08,131;00:37:11,505;he's not going to get it.
494;00:37:11,506;00:37:14,046;If he really believes
494;00:37:11,506;00:37:14,046;I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...
495;00:37:14,047;00:37:16,213;You should reopen
495;00:37:14,047;00:37:16,213;the fighting pits.
496;00:37:16,214;00:37:19,088;What?
497;00:37:19,089;00:37:20,714;My mother was a whore.
497;00:37:19,089;00:37:20,714;I told you that.
498;00:37:22,797;00:37:25,463;She liked to drink pear brandy.
499;00:37:25,464;00:37:29,546;The older she got, the less
499;00:37:25,464;00:37:29,546;she made selling her body,
500;00:37:29,547;00:37:31,921;the more she wanted to drink.
501;00:37:31,922;00:37:35,130;So one day when I was 12,
501;00:37:31,922;00:37:35,130;she sold me to a slaver
502;00:37:35,131;00:37:37,755;she fucked the night before.
503;00:37:37,756;00:37:40,046;I'm sorry.
504;00:37:40,047;00:37:42,796;Why?
504;00:37:40,047;00:37:42,796;I was a bad child.
505;00:37:42,797;00:37:45,588;I wasn't big, but I was quick.
506;00:37:45,589;00:37:47,880;And I loved to fight.
507;00:37:47,881;00:37:49,880;So they sold me
507;00:37:47,881;00:37:49,880;to a man in Tolos
508;00:37:49,881;00:37:52,046;who trained fighters
508;00:37:49,881;00:37:52,046;for the pits.
509;00:37:52,047;00:37:54,671;I had my first match
509;00:37:52,047;00:37:54,671;when I was 16.
510;00:37:54,672;00:37:56,838;You were sold into slavery,
511;00:37:56,839;00:37:59,296;forced to fight to the death
511;00:37:56,839;00:37:59,296;for the amusement of the masters,
512;00:37:59,297;00:38:00,817;and you're defending
512;00:37:59,297;00:38:00,817;the fighting pits?
513;00:38:02,506;00:38:05,296;I'm only here
513;00:38:02,506;00:38:05,296;because of those pits.
514;00:38:05,297;00:38:07,921;I learned to fight
514;00:38:05,297;00:38:07,921;like a Dothraki screamer,
515;00:38:07,922;00:38:09,338;a Norvoshi priest,
515;00:38:07,922;00:38:09,338;a Westerosi knight.
516;00:38:09,339;00:38:11,963;Soon I was famous.
517;00:38:11,964;00:38:14,213;10,000 men and women
517;00:38:11,964;00:38:14,213;screamed my name
518;00:38:14,214;00:38:15,296;when I stepped into the pit.
519;00:38:15,297;00:38:16,796;I made so much money
519;00:38:15,297;00:38:16,796;for my master,
520;00:38:16,797;00:38:19,588;he set me free when he died.
521;00:38:19,589;00:38:21,380;I joined the Second Sons.
522;00:38:21,381;00:38:24,297;And then I met you.
523;00:38:29,797;00:38:31,130;You're the queen.
524;00:38:31,131;00:38:34,671;Everyone's too afraid
524;00:38:31,131;00:38:34,671;of you to speak truth.
525;00:38:34,672;00:38:37,255;Everyone but me.
526;00:38:37,256;00:38:41,463;You've made thousands
526;00:38:37,256;00:38:41,463;of enemies all across the world.
527;00:38:41,464;00:38:44,255;As soon as they see weakness,
528;00:38:44,256;00:38:46,505;they'll attack.
529;00:38:46,506;00:38:50,046;Show your strength here, now.
530;00:38:50,047;00:38:52,208;That's why I have the Unsullied
530;00:38:50,047;00:38:52,208;patrolling the streets.
531;00:38:54,422;00:38:57,963;Anyone with a chest
531;00:38:54,422;00:38:57,963;full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied.
532;00:38:57,964;00:39:01,713;You're not
532;00:38:57,964;00:39:01,713;the Mother of Unsullied.
533;00:39:01,714;00:39:02,874;You're the Mother of Dragons.
534;00:39:10,547;00:39:14,422;I don't want another child's bones
534;00:39:10,547;00:39:14,422;dropped at my feet.
535;00:39:15,422;00:39:18,296;No one's seen Drogon in weeks.
536;00:39:18,297;00:39:20,756;For all I know, he's flown halfway
536;00:39:18,297;00:39:20,756;across the world.
537;00:39:25,714;00:39:27,839;I can't control them anymore.
538;00:39:29,256;00:39:32,796;A dragon queen with no dragons
539;00:39:32,797;00:39:33,922;is not a queen.
540;00:40:40,339;00:40:42,631;Viserion?
541;00:40:44,631;00:40:46,506;Rhaegal?
542;00:40:58,506;00:41:00,046;Easy. Easy.
543;00:41:00,047;00:41:02,213;Easy.
544;00:41:41,631;00:41:43,838;So here we are.
545;00:41:43,839;00:41:44,922;Here we are.
546;00:41:47,714;00:41:51,505;When we first met,
546;00:41:47,714;00:41:51,505;you were my prisoner.
547;00:41:51,506;00:41:53,714;And now, for our last meeting...
548;00:41:56,047;00:41:59,505;This doesn't have to be
548;00:41:56,047;00:41:59,505;our last meeting.
549;00:41:59,506;00:42:01,922;No, but it will be.
550;00:42:04,464;00:42:06,796;You know what Stannis wants?
551;00:42:06,797;00:42:09,338;He wants me to bend the knee.
552;00:42:09,339;00:42:11,713;And he wants the free folk
552;00:42:09,339;00:42:11,713;to fight for him.
553;00:42:11,714;00:42:14,921;I'll give him this much,
554;00:42:14,922;00:42:16,255;he's bold.
555;00:42:16,256;00:42:17,796;Shouldn't a king be bold?
556;00:42:17,797;00:42:19,880;Oh, aye.
557;00:42:19,881;00:42:23,005;I respect him.
558;00:42:23,006;00:42:24,546;If he gets what he wants,
559;00:42:24,547;00:42:26,255;I expect he'll be a better ruler
559;00:42:24,547;00:42:26,255;than the fools
560;00:42:26,256;00:42:30,171;sitting on the Iron Throne
560;00:42:26,256;00:42:30,171;the last hundred years.
561;00:42:30,172;00:42:32,631;But I'll never serve him.
562;00:42:33,881;00:42:35,671;You told me you weren't
562;00:42:33,881;00:42:35,671;here to conquer.
563;00:42:35,672;00:42:37,005;You told me your people
563;00:42:35,672;00:42:37,005;have bled enough.
564;00:42:37,006;00:42:38,630;That's right.
565;00:42:38,631;00:42:41,921;I don't want them bleeding for
565;00:42:38,631;00:42:41,921;Stannis Baratheon either.
566;00:42:41,922;00:42:45,380;You spent your life convincing
566;00:42:41,922;00:42:45,380;90 clans to come together
567;00:42:45,381;00:42:46,463;for the first time in history.
568;00:42:46,464;00:42:49,630;Thenns and Hornfoots,
569;00:42:49,631;00:42:52,713;the ice-river clans,
569;00:42:49,631;00:42:52,713;even the giants.
570;00:42:52,714;00:42:55,713;A life's work uniting them.
570;00:42:52,714;00:42:55,713;You didn't do it for power.
571;00:42:55,714;00:42:59,088;You didn't do it for glory.
572;00:42:59,089;00:43:01,255;You brought them
572;00:42:59,089;00:43:01,255;together to save them
573;00:43:01,256;00:43:02,796;because none of them
573;00:43:01,256;00:43:02,796;will survive the winter,
574;00:43:02,797;00:43:04,671;not if they're north
574;00:43:02,797;00:43:04,671;of the Wall.
575;00:43:04,672;00:43:06,671;Isn't their survival
575;00:43:04,672;00:43:06,671;more important than your pride?
576;00:43:06,672;00:43:08,506;Pride?
577;00:43:10,672;00:43:13,214;Fuck my pride.
578;00:43:14,506;00:43:16,797;This isn't about that.
579;00:43:19,297;00:43:21,922;Then bend the knee
579;00:43:19,297;00:43:21,922;and save your people.
580;00:43:24,797;00:43:28,046;They followed me
580;00:43:24,797;00:43:28,046;because they respected me.
581;00:43:28,047;00:43:30,005;Because they believed in me.
582;00:43:30,006;00:43:32,380;The moment I kneel
582;00:43:30,006;00:43:32,380;for a southern king, that's all gone.
583;00:43:32,381;00:43:35,671;And how many tens of thousands
583;00:43:32,381;00:43:35,671;are out there right now?
584;00:43:35,672;00:43:38,921;How many women?
584;00:43:35,672;00:43:38,921;How many children?
585;00:43:38,922;00:43:41,963;And you won't go out and rescue
585;00:43:38,922;00:43:41,963;them because why?
586;00:43:41,964;00:43:44,171;You're afraid of looking afraid.
587;00:43:44,172;00:43:47,006;Oh, I am afraid.
588;00:43:47,631;00:43:49,797;No shame in that.
589;00:43:59,172;00:44:03,088;How will they do it?
589;00:43:59,172;00:44:03,088;Beheading?
590;00:44:03,089;00:44:04,964;Hanging?
591;00:44:07,672;00:44:10,256;They'll burn you alive.
592;00:44:14,922;00:44:16,714;Bad way to go.
593;00:44:20,839;00:44:22,671;I'll be honest with you.
594;00:44:22,672;00:44:24,671;I don't want to die.
595;00:44:24,672;00:44:26,838;And burnt to death,
596;00:44:26,839;00:44:28,796;I don't want people
596;00:44:26,839;00:44:28,796;to remember me like that,
597;00:44:28,797;00:44:30,671;scorched and screaming.
598;00:44:30,672;00:44:33,463;But it's better than betraying
599;00:44:33,464;00:44:35,171;everything I believe.
600;00:44:35,172;00:44:37,630;And what happens to your people?
601;00:44:37,631;00:44:41,380;You preserve your dignity
601;00:44:37,631;00:44:41,380;and die standing
602;00:44:41,381;00:44:43,796;and they'll sing
602;00:44:41,381;00:44:43,796;songs about you.
603;00:44:43,797;00:44:45,255;You'd rather burn than kneel.
604;00:44:45,256;00:44:46,922;The great hero.
605;00:44:49,756;00:44:52,630;Until winter comes and
605;00:44:49,756;00:44:52,630;the white walkers come for us all
606;00:44:52,631;00:44:55,297;and there's no one left to sing.
607;00:44:57,714;00:44:59,296;You're a good lad.
608;00:44:59,297;00:45:02,463;Truly you are.
609;00:45:02,464;00:45:07,505;But if you can't understand why I won't
609;00:45:02,464;00:45:07,505;enlist my people
610;00:45:07,506;00:45:10,255;in a foreigner's war,
611;00:45:10,256;00:45:12,256;there's no point explaining.
612;00:45:28,839;00:45:30,838;I think you're making
612;00:45:28,839;00:45:30,838;a terrible mistake.
613;00:45:32,672;00:45:35,213;The freedom to make
613;00:45:32,672;00:45:35,213;my own mistakes
614;00:45:35,214;00:45:36,881;was all I ever wanted.
615;00:46:46,589;00:46:50,213;Mance Rayder, you've been called
615;00:46:46,589;00:46:50,213;the King-beyond-the-Wall.
616;00:46:50,214;00:46:52,963;Westeros only has one king.
617;00:46:52,964;00:46:55,297;Bend the knee,
617;00:46:52,964;00:46:55,297;I promise you mercy.
618;00:47:08,839;00:47:10,964;Kneel and live.
619;00:47:18,339;00:47:22,131;This was my home for many years.
620;00:47:23,881;00:47:25,463;I wish you good fortune
621;00:47:25,464;00:47:28,131;in the wars to come.
622;00:48:09,506;00:48:12,546;We all must choose.
623;00:48:12,547;00:48:17,130;Man or woman, young or old,
624;00:48:17,131;00:48:20,546;lord or peasant,
624;00:48:17,131;00:48:20,546;our choices are the same.
625;00:48:20,547;00:48:24,046;We choose light
625;00:48:20,547;00:48:24,046;or we choose darkness.
626;00:48:24,047;00:48:27,088;We choose good
626;00:48:24,047;00:48:27,088;or we choose evil.
627;00:48:27,089;00:48:31,797;We choose the true god
627;00:48:27,089;00:48:31,797;or the false.
628;00:48:42,756;00:48:44,671;Free folk,
629;00:48:44,672;00:48:47,088;there is only one true king
630;00:48:47,089;00:48:50,213;and his name is Stannis.
631;00:48:50,214;00:48:52,671;Here stands your king of lies.
632;00:48:52,672;00:48:55,797;Behold the fate of those
632;00:48:52,672;00:48:55,797;who choose the darkness.
