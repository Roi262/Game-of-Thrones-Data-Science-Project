2;00:01:53,803;00:01:55,870;My son.
3;00:01:57,340;00:01:59,406;My firstborn son.
4;00:02:02,778;00:02:06,347;My child king, hush.
5;00:02:08,618;00:02:11,418;Listen to the gods,
5;00:02:08,618;00:02:11,418;for you they sing.
6;00:02:15,458;00:02:17,124;Fight no more, sweet child.
7;00:02:17,226;00:02:19,260;Your wars are won.
8;00:02:20,897;00:02:23,264;The wolves are buried
9;00:02:23,366;00:02:25,666;and the false stag done.
10;00:02:30,039;00:02:32,239;Shut your blue eyes, my love.
11;00:02:32,341;00:02:33,874;Let the crown fall.
12;00:02:33,976;00:02:36,577;The Father above
12;00:02:33,976;00:02:36,577;beckons you to his hall.
13;00:02:38,414;00:02:41,515;In Seventh Heaven
13;00:02:38,414;00:02:41,515;I'll see you once more.
14;00:02:45,254;00:02:49,890;But now I seek vengeance
14;00:02:45,254;00:02:49,890;on Sansa the whore
15;00:02:49,992;00:02:52,726;and my brother the Imp
16;00:02:52,828;00:02:55,629;who killed his own king.
17;00:02:55,731;00:02:58,399;Born amongst lions,
17;00:02:55,731;00:02:58,399;our curse from within.
18;00:02:58,501;00:03:00,768;I will slay him, I swear.
19;00:03:00,870;00:03:03,437;With noose or with knife,
20;00:03:03,539;00:03:06,140;though it take me a fortnight,
21;00:03:06,242;00:03:09,777;a moon or my life.
22;00:03:34,337;00:03:36,737;What is that
22;00:03:34,337;00:03:36,737;I hear and smell?
23;00:03:36,839;00:03:40,140;Someone I'll soon send to hell.
24;00:03:40,242;00:03:42,876;It's time to see if truth they told
25;00:03:42,979;00:03:45,813;who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.
26;00:03:45,915;00:03:47,648;Get the wig!
27;00:03:47,750;00:03:51,418;You beast, you beast.
27;00:03:47,750;00:03:51,418;You killed my wife.
28;00:03:51,520;00:03:54,688;And now you've taken
28;00:03:51,520;00:03:54,688;your father's life.
29;00:03:54,790;00:03:57,925;No worse child
29;00:03:54,790;00:03:57,925;ever stained this land.
30;00:03:58,027;00:04:01,261;I curse the day I named you.
31;00:04:03,633;00:04:06,533;My greatest crime!
32;00:04:38,267;00:04:39,967;You're good at that.
33;00:04:40,069;00:04:42,536;Where did you learn?
34;00:04:42,638;00:04:44,271;I'm a jealous woman.
35;00:04:44,373;00:04:46,674;I've always liked bad men
36;00:04:46,776;00:04:48,876;and they've always liked me.
37;00:04:50,713;00:04:53,447;They'd come home wherever
37;00:04:50,713;00:04:53,447;home was that night
38;00:04:53,549;00:04:57,751;stinking of some whore's perfume.
39;00:04:57,853;00:05:00,688;So we'd fight and I'd
39;00:04:57,853;00:05:00,688;put a hole in them.
40;00:05:00,790;00:05:03,524;And then I'd feel terrible,
41;00:05:03,626;00:05:05,592;so I'd patch them up.
42;00:05:05,695;00:05:07,094;I got good at patching them up.
43;00:05:07,196;00:05:08,829;And good at putting holes in them.
44;00:05:08,931;00:05:11,165;And that.
45;00:05:14,003;00:05:16,236;What happened to the actress?
46;00:05:16,338;00:05:19,440;The one who wanted you dead.
47;00:05:19,542;00:05:21,175;Bianca.
48;00:05:21,277;00:05:23,811;She'll have a hard time
48;00:05:21,277;00:05:23,811;finding work as an actress
49;00:05:23,913;00:05:25,946;after what I did to her face.
50;00:05:31,187;00:05:32,386;Mmm.
51;00:05:32,488;00:05:34,555;I never did learn to cook.
52;00:05:34,657;00:05:37,224;But eat.
52;00:05:34,657;00:05:37,224;Eat. You need it.
53;00:05:39,328;00:05:42,196;The company is moving
53;00:05:39,328;00:05:42,196;on to Pentos soon.
54;00:05:42,298;00:05:43,831;You should come with us.
55;00:05:43,933;00:05:45,966;I can't.
55;00:05:43,933;00:05:45,966;Why not?
56;00:05:46,068;00:05:48,502;Got a feeling you'd be
56;00:05:46,068;00:05:48,502;good at this sort of work.
57;00:05:48,604;00:05:50,671;And besides, we need a new actress.
58;00:05:50,773;00:05:54,508;I don't think I could
58;00:05:50,773;00:05:54,508;remember all of the lines.
59;00:05:54,610;00:05:57,010;Come with us.
60;00:05:57,113;00:05:59,079;What's left for you here?
61;00:06:00,249;00:06:03,016;You wouldn't be safe.
62;00:06:03,119;00:06:05,919;Not while she's looking for me.
63;00:06:06,021;00:06:08,155;Who?
64;00:06:08,257;00:06:09,823;She doesn't have a name.
65;00:06:15,498;00:06:17,064;Where will you go?
66;00:06:19,902;00:06:23,437;Essos is east and Westeros is west.
67;00:06:23,539;00:06:25,506;But what's west of Westeros?
68;00:06:26,909;00:06:27,975;I don't know.
69;00:06:28,077;00:06:29,643;Nobody does.
70;00:06:29,745;00:06:31,845;That's where all the maps stop.
71;00:06:31,947;00:06:33,881;The edge of the world, maybe.
72;00:06:33,983;00:06:35,282;I'd like to see that.
73;00:06:46,195;00:06:48,362;What's that?
73;00:06:46,195;00:06:48,362;Milk of the poppy.
74;00:06:48,464;00:06:50,030;I don't want any.
75;00:06:52,201;00:06:55,335;Sleep is the only way you'll heal.
76;00:06:55,437;00:06:59,273;Trust me, if my soup didn't
76;00:06:55,437;00:06:59,273;kill you, nothing will.
77;00:07:41,617;00:07:44,985;Thing about Gatins, right,
77;00:07:41,617;00:07:44,985;is he used to be pretty.
78;00:07:45,087;00:07:46,420;I was a famous kisser.
79;00:07:46,522;00:07:49,089;You lads know how to kiss proper?
80;00:07:51,126;00:07:52,259;Course we do.
81;00:07:52,361;00:07:54,895;This is for masters, this technique.
82;00:07:54,997;00:07:56,830;You're not ready.
82;00:07:54,997;00:07:56,830;I'm ready.
83;00:07:56,932;00:07:59,333;He says he's ready.
84;00:07:59,435;00:08:02,436;All right.
84;00:07:59,435;00:08:02,436;Now, pay attention.
85;00:08:04,907;00:08:08,542;You put your left hand on the
85;00:08:04,907;00:08:08,542;back of the lady's head.
86;00:08:08,644;00:08:11,945;Your right hand holds the small
86;00:08:08,644;00:08:11,945;of the lady's back like so.
87;00:08:13,115;00:08:14,448;Very romantic.
88;00:08:14,550;00:08:17,551;Take your middle finger, yeah,
89;00:08:17,653;00:08:19,753;and you jam it right up her bunghole.
90;00:08:22,758;00:08:24,157;So fucking close!
91;00:08:24,260;00:08:26,894;Ah, it smells like pussy to me.
92;00:08:26,996;00:08:28,595;Look at him.
92;00:08:26,996;00:08:28,595;You get hard, boy?
93;00:08:28,697;00:08:31,765;Fuck you!
93;00:08:28,697;00:08:31,765;Disgusting old twats.
94;00:08:35,504;00:08:38,238;Got off on that,
94;00:08:35,504;00:08:38,238;did you, you old fuck?
95;00:09:00,162;00:09:01,695;Where's the other one?
96;00:09:01,797;00:09:04,331;The one with the yellow cloak.
96;00:09:01,797;00:09:04,331;Fuck you!
97;00:09:04,433;00:09:06,733;Those are your last words, fuck you?
98;00:09:06,835;00:09:08,702;Come on, you can do better.
99;00:09:08,804;00:09:10,170;Cunt!
100;00:09:10,272;00:09:12,739;You're shit at dying, you know that?
101;00:09:28,023;00:09:31,825;_
102;00:09:32,070;00:09:35,632;_
103;00:09:37,106;00:09:41,559;_
104;00:09:42,023;00:09:45,193;_
105;00:09:47,141;00:09:48,976;I'd call that a successful gambit.
106;00:09:49,078;00:09:50,877;Would you?
106;00:09:49,078;00:09:50,877;Look around.
107;00:09:50,980;00:09:53,080;The city has come back to life.
108;00:09:53,182;00:09:56,850;You made a pact with fanatics.
108;00:09:53,182;00:09:56,850;I did and it worked.
109;00:09:56,952;00:10:00,721;If you shaved your beard with a straight
109;00:09:56,952;00:10:00,721;razor, you'd say the razor worked.
110;00:10:00,823;00:10:02,990;That doesn't mean
110;00:10:00,823;00:10:02,990;it won't cut your throat.
111;00:10:03,092;00:10:06,326;Spoken like a man who has
111;00:10:03,092;00:10:06,326;never had to shave.
112;00:10:11,066;00:10:12,799;I'm going to miss you.
113;00:10:12,901;00:10:14,501;I know.
114;00:10:14,603;00:10:17,604;I hope you're right about
114;00:10:14,603;00:10:17,604;this expedition of yours.
115;00:10:17,706;00:10:20,974;If I don't return,
115;00:10:17,706;00:10:20,974;you'll know I was wrong.
116;00:10:24,747;00:10:26,480;We need friends in Westeros.
117;00:10:26,582;00:10:28,148;And we need ships.
118;00:10:28,250;00:10:29,783;Most of all, we need our queen.
119;00:10:29,885;00:10:33,353;She'll come back.
119;00:10:29,885;00:10:33,353;She has to.
120;00:10:33,455;00:10:36,156;My heart's been broken
120;00:10:33,455;00:10:36,156;too many times already.
121;00:10:38,227;00:10:40,694;I'll walk the rest of the way myself.
122;00:10:40,796;00:10:42,396;I can't go off on a secret mission
123;00:10:42,498;00:10:45,098;in the company of the most
123;00:10:42,498;00:10:45,098;famous dwarf in the city.
124;00:10:48,704;00:10:50,971;Varys.
125;00:10:51,073;00:10:54,074;The most famous dwarf in the world.
126;00:11:22,237;00:11:24,671;Your Grace, several members
126;00:11:22,237;00:11:24,671;of the Faith Militant
127;00:11:24,773;00:11:27,441;have been permitted
127;00:11:24,773;00:11:27,441;entry to the Red Keep.
128;00:11:27,543;00:11:29,776;Have been permitted?
129;00:11:29,878;00:11:32,012;That's rather a tortured
129;00:11:29,878;00:11:32,012;way of putting it.
130;00:11:32,114;00:11:34,648;They demand to see you, Your Grace.
131;00:11:34,750;00:11:36,783;Who permitted them
131;00:11:34,750;00:11:36,783;inside the Red Keep?
132;00:11:40,289;00:11:42,322;The king is aware of their presence?
133;00:11:42,424;00:11:43,857;He is, Your Grace.
134;00:11:43,959;00:11:46,660;He's currently in his
134;00:11:43,959;00:11:46,660;chambers at prayer.
135;00:12:02,177;00:12:04,377;Your Grace, His Holiness
135;00:12:02,177;00:12:04,377;the High Septon
136;00:12:04,480;00:12:07,180;wishes to speak with you at
136;00:12:04,480;00:12:07,180;the Great Sept of Baelor.
137;00:12:07,282;00:12:08,915;His Holiness the High Septon
138;00:12:09,017;00:12:11,885;is welcome to see me
138;00:12:09,017;00:12:11,885;here in the Red Keep.
139;00:12:11,987;00:12:14,454;Your Grace, this is not a request.
140;00:12:14,556;00:12:16,756;It is a request, Cousin Lancel.
141;00:12:16,859;00:12:19,459;You are asking me for
141;00:12:16,859;00:12:19,459;something, I'm refusing.
142;00:12:21,263;00:12:24,397;The High Septon commands you.
143;00:12:24,500;00:12:26,600;Are you sure you want to refuse him?
144;00:12:28,937;00:12:32,005;He promised me I could stay in
144;00:12:28,937;00:12:32,005;the Red Keep until my trial.
145;00:12:32,107;00:12:34,040;He made no such promises.
146;00:12:34,143;00:12:36,166;If you refuse to come of your
146;00:12:34,143;00:12:36,166;own free will--
147;00:12:36,286;00:12:37,407;Get out.
148;00:12:47,222;00:12:48,822;Move aside, ser.
149;00:12:52,094;00:12:55,028;Order your man to step aside
149;00:12:52,094;00:12:55,028;or there will be violence.
150;00:13:02,638;00:13:04,304;I choose violence.
151;00:13:45,514;00:13:49,049;Please tell His High Holiness
151;00:13:45,514;00:13:49,049;he's always welcome to visit.
152;00:14:00,629;00:14:02,896;Looks like a siege, my lady.
153;00:14:02,998;00:14:06,366;You have a keen military mind, Pod.
154;00:14:15,544;00:14:18,211;My lady.
154;00:14:15,544;00:14:18,211;My lady.
155;00:14:21,583;00:14:23,917;Who goes there?!
156;00:14:24,019;00:14:25,252;State your business!
157;00:14:25,354;00:14:27,387;My name is Brienne of Tarth.
158;00:14:27,489;00:14:31,324;Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister
158;00:14:27,489;00:14:31,324;I've come to speak with him.
159;00:14:33,262;00:14:36,229;Tell him I have his sword.
160;00:14:47,409;00:14:49,676;Getting a bit old
160;00:14:47,409;00:14:49,676;to be a squire, aren't we?
161;00:14:55,117;00:14:56,383;Podrick fucking Payne.
162;00:14:56,485;00:14:59,085;I thought you'd be dead by now.
163;00:14:59,187;00:15:00,587;Not yet.
164;00:15:02,291;00:15:04,357;Are they in there?
164;00:15:02,291;00:15:04,357;Uh-huh.
165;00:15:08,230;00:15:10,330;You think they're fucking?
166;00:15:10,432;00:15:11,965;What?
167;00:15:12,067;00:15:13,667;No.
168;00:15:13,769;00:15:16,636;Why not?
168;00:15:13,769;00:15:16,636;I'd fuck her.
169;00:15:16,738;00:15:18,371;You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?
170;00:15:18,473;00:15:20,774;I'm her squire.
170;00:15:18,473;00:15:20,774;Oh.
171;00:15:20,876;00:15:24,077;Well, he'd
171;00:15:20,876;00:15:24,077;fuck her, that's for sure.
172;00:15:24,179;00:15:26,146;And she'd fuck him, don't you think?
173;00:15:26,248;00:15:28,081;The way she looks at him.
174;00:15:28,183;00:15:30,684;The way all women look at
174;00:15:28,183;00:15:30,684;him is frankly irritating.
175;00:15:30,786;00:15:33,887;I preferred working with the
175;00:15:30,786;00:15:33,887;little brother on that account.
176;00:15:33,989;00:15:37,724;Come on, you're the one
176;00:15:33,989;00:15:37,724;with the magic cock.
177;00:15:39,127;00:15:41,227;You must have shown it to her by now.
178;00:15:43,265;00:15:45,965;She's training me to fight.
178;00:15:43,265;00:15:45,965;Is she?
179;00:15:46,068;00:15:48,501;Oh.
179;00:15:46,068;00:15:48,501;An hour in the morning, an hour at night.
180;00:15:48,603;00:15:50,403;Every day.
181;00:15:50,505;00:15:54,307;Then how come an old cunt like me
181;00:15:50,505;00:15:54,307;can still sneak up and murder you?
182;00:15:54,409;00:15:56,943;Well, that's a different
182;00:15:54,409;00:15:56,943;sort of fighting.
183;00:15:57,045;00:15:58,645;Now, that's the truth, isn't it?
184;00:15:58,747;00:16:01,314;You want to learn
184;00:15:58,747;00:16:01,314;that sort of fighting?
185;00:16:02,684;00:16:04,517;All right.
186;00:16:04,619;00:16:06,886;All right, let's start
186;00:16:04,619;00:16:06,886;with your footwork.
187;00:16:06,988;00:16:09,189;Show me your stance.
188;00:16:10,625;00:16:12,192;Now listen to me, Pod.
189;00:16:12,294;00:16:14,961;See how your feet
189;00:16:12,294;00:16:14,961;are about a yard apart?
190;00:16:15,063;00:16:17,864;Lesson number one, assume
190;00:16:15,063;00:16:17,864;everyone wants to hit you.
191;00:16:17,966;00:16:22,068;'Cause they do, Pod. Everyone
191;00:16:17,966;00:16:22,068;wants to hit a fucking squire.
192;00:16:22,170;00:16:24,771;Do it again.
192;00:16:22,170;00:16:24,771;Come on, don't sulk.
193;00:16:24,873;00:16:26,473;I never thought
193;00:16:24,873;00:16:26,473;you'd find her.
194;00:16:26,575;00:16:28,007;I just assumed Sansa was dead.
195;00:16:28,110;00:16:30,210;Why would you assume that?
196;00:16:30,312;00:16:34,247;In my experience, girls like
196;00:16:30,312;00:16:34,247;her don't live very long.
197;00:16:34,349;00:16:36,983;I don't think you know
197;00:16:34,349;00:16:36,983;many girls like her.
198;00:16:37,085;00:16:40,019;Well, I'm proud of you.
199;00:16:40,122;00:16:42,722;I am. You fulfilled your
199;00:16:40,122;00:16:42,722;oath to Catelyn Stark
200;00:16:42,824;00:16:44,591;against all odds.
201;00:16:44,693;00:16:47,660;Of course, my sister
201;00:16:44,693;00:16:47,660;wants Sansa dead.
202;00:16:47,763;00:16:50,363;The girl is still a suspect
202;00:16:47,763;00:16:50,363;in Joffrey's murder,
203;00:16:50,465;00:16:54,200;so there is that complication.
204;00:16:55,971;00:16:57,291;What the hell are you doing here?
205;00:16:57,339;00:16:59,072;I've come for the Blackfish.
206;00:16:59,174;00:17:00,974;You're welcome to have him.
207;00:17:01,076;00:17:04,844;Lady Sansa desires to take her
207;00:17:01,076;00:17:04,844;ancestral seat back from the Boltons
208;00:17:04,946;00:17:08,114;and assume her rightful
208;00:17:04,946;00:17:08,114;position as Lady of Winterfell.
209;00:17:08,216;00:17:11,284;With what army does she
209;00:17:08,216;00:17:11,284;plan on taking Winterfell?
210;00:17:11,386;00:17:12,752;The Tully army.
211;00:17:12,854;00:17:14,587;They're a bit occupied at the moment.
212;00:17:14,689;00:17:16,356;I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun
213;00:17:16,458;00:17:18,191;currently defended
213;00:17:16,458;00:17:18,191;by the Tully rebels,
214;00:17:18,293;00:17:19,993;so you can see the conundrum.
215;00:17:20,095;00:17:22,195;The Tullys are rebels because
215;00:17:20,095;00:17:22,195;they're fighting for their home?
216;00:17:22,297;00:17:24,731;Riverrun was granted to
216;00:17:22,297;00:17:24,731;the Freys by royal decree.
217;00:17:24,833;00:17:28,334;As a reward for betraying Robb
217;00:17:24,833;00:17:28,334;Stark and slaughtering his family.
218;00:17:28,437;00:17:29,836;Exactly.
219;00:17:33,809;00:17:35,475;We shouldn't argue about politics.
220;00:17:35,577;00:17:38,311;You're a knight, Ser Jaime.
221;00:17:38,413;00:17:40,380;I know there is honor in you.
222;00:17:40,482;00:17:43,249;I've seen it myself.
222;00:17:40,482;00:17:43,249;I'm a Lannister.
223;00:17:43,351;00:17:45,251;Don't ask me to betray my own house.
224;00:17:45,353;00:17:47,620;I do no such thing.
225;00:17:47,722;00:17:50,290;Take Riverrun without bloodshed.
226;00:17:50,392;00:17:53,927;Ride south again with your mission
226;00:17:50,392;00:17:53,927;complete and your army intact.
227;00:17:54,029;00:17:55,628;What do you propose?
228;00:17:55,730;00:17:59,399;Allow me to enter Riverrun
228;00:17:55,730;00:17:59,399;under a flag of truce.
229;00:17:59,501;00:18:01,835;Let me try to persuade the
229;00:17:59,501;00:18:01,835;Blackfish to give up the castle.
230;00:18:01,937;00:18:03,937;Why would he abandon
230;00:18:01,937;00:18:03,937;his ancestral home?
231;00:18:04,039;00:18:07,640;Because you'll allow him to lead
231;00:18:04,039;00:18:07,640;the Tully forces safely north.
232;00:18:10,645;00:18:12,512;Have you ever met the Blackfish?
233;00:18:14,583;00:18:17,417;No.
233;00:18:14,583;00:18:17,417;He's even more stubborn than you are.
234;00:18:17,519;00:18:19,586;All right.
235;00:18:19,688;00:18:22,088;Try to talk some sense
235;00:18:19,688;00:18:22,088;into the old goat.
236;00:18:22,190;00:18:24,491;He won't listen, but his men might.
237;00:18:24,593;00:18:27,060;Not everybody wants to die
237;00:18:24,593;00:18:27,060;for someone else's home.
238;00:18:27,162;00:18:29,195;I need your word.
239;00:18:30,565;00:18:32,432;If I persuade him
239;00:18:30,565;00:18:32,432;to abandon the castle,
240;00:18:32,534;00:18:34,968;you'll grant a safe passage north.
241;00:18:35,070;00:18:37,270;You have my word.
242;00:18:37,372;00:18:39,305;You have until nightfall.
243;00:18:56,224;00:18:58,892;You gave it to me for a purpose.
244;00:18:58,994;00:19:02,195;I've achieved that purpose.
245;00:19:05,000;00:19:06,666;It's yours.
246;00:19:08,403;00:19:10,403;It will always be yours.
247;00:19:19,714;00:19:21,714;One last thing, Ser Jaime.
248;00:19:21,816;00:19:23,950;Yes, Lady Brienne?
249;00:19:24,052;00:19:27,987;Should I fail to persuade
249;00:19:24,052;00:19:27,987;the Blackfish to surrender
250;00:19:28,089;00:19:30,957;and if you attack the castle,
251;00:19:31,059;00:19:34,093;honor compels me
251;00:19:31,059;00:19:34,093;to fight for Sansa's kin.
252;00:19:34,195;00:19:36,262;Of course it does.
253;00:19:36,364;00:19:37,864;To fight you.
254;00:19:42,370;00:19:44,537;Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
255;00:19:54,783;00:19:56,816;I've said no
255;00:19:54,783;00:19:56,816;three times already.
256;00:19:56,918;00:19:59,152;I have a signed letter
256;00:19:56,918;00:19:59,152;from your niece Sansa Stark.
257;00:19:59,254;00:20:01,054;I haven't seen her
257;00:19:59,254;00:20:01,054;since she was a child.
258;00:20:01,156;00:20:03,323;I don't know her signature.
258;00:20:01,156;00:20:03,323;I don't know you.
259;00:20:03,425;00:20:06,893;And I will not surrender.
259;00:20:03,425;00:20:06,893;Double the guards tonight.
260;00:20:08,296;00:20:10,530;The Kingslayer wants to try us.
261;00:20:10,632;00:20:12,565;I can feel it.
262;00:20:13,668;00:20:15,234;As I have said,
262;00:20:13,668;00:20:15,234;my name is--
263;00:20:15,337;00:20:17,770;Yes, Brienne of Tarth.
263;00:20:15,337;00:20:17,770;I know your father.
264;00:20:17,872;00:20:19,672;Good man.
264;00:20:17,872;00:20:19,672;He always spoke highly of you.
265;00:20:19,774;00:20:22,475;And if he were here now, I'd tell
265;00:20:19,774;00:20:22,475;him the same I'm telling you.
266;00:20:22,577;00:20:25,011;If you think I'm abandoning
266;00:20:22,577;00:20:25,011;my family's seat
267;00:20:25,113;00:20:27,413;on the Kingslayer's word of
267;00:20:25,113;00:20:27,413;honor, you're a bloody fool.
268;00:20:27,515;00:20:30,183;Riverrun cannot stand against
268;00:20:27,515;00:20:30,183;the Lannisters and the Freys.
269;00:20:30,285;00:20:33,886;We can stand longer than your
269;00:20:30,285;00:20:33,886;one-handed friend thinks we can.
270;00:20:33,989;00:20:36,422;He's not my friend.
270;00:20:33,989;00:20:36,422;No?
271;00:20:38,193;00:20:41,160;Who gave you permission to cross the
271;00:20:38,193;00:20:41,160;siege line and enter the castle?
272;00:20:41,262;00:20:44,030;Who gave you that sword with
272;00:20:41,262;00:20:44,030;the gold lion on the pommel?
273;00:20:44,132;00:20:47,934;Ser Jaime kept his word
273;00:20:44,132;00:20:47,934;to your niece Catelyn Stark.
274;00:20:48,036;00:20:51,270;He sent me to find Sansa,
274;00:20:48,036;00:20:51,270;to help her as Catelyn wanted.
275;00:20:51,373;00:20:53,473;He gave me this sword to protect her.
276;00:20:53,575;00:20:56,242;That is what I have done
276;00:20:53,575;00:20:56,242;and I will continue to do
277;00:20:56,344;00:20:58,645;until the day I die.
278;00:21:11,793;00:21:14,127;She's exactly like her mother.
279;00:21:20,435;00:21:23,469;I don't have enough men to
279;00:21:20,435;00:21:23,469;help her take Winterfell.
280;00:21:23,571;00:21:25,638;You have more than she does.
281;00:21:25,740;00:21:28,274;She wants her home back.
281;00:21:25,740;00:21:28,274;I understand that.
282;00:21:28,376;00:21:30,243;But this is my home.
283;00:21:30,345;00:21:32,311;And if Jaime Lannister wants it,
284;00:21:32,414;00:21:36,015;he can bloody well take it
284;00:21:32,414;00:21:36,015;the way everyone else does.
285;00:21:52,767;00:21:55,468;Find the maester.
286;00:21:55,570;00:21:58,271;We need to get a raven
286;00:21:55,570;00:21:58,271;north to Sansa.
287;00:22:00,041;00:22:01,774;What should I write?
288;00:22:04,579;00:22:06,446;Tell her I failed.
289;00:22:37,278;00:22:38,878;There's to be a royal announcement?
290;00:22:38,980;00:22:40,947;There is.
291;00:22:41,049;00:22:42,648;Why wasn't I informed?
292;00:22:44,619;00:22:47,720;There is to be a royal announcement
293;00:22:47,822;00:22:49,789;in the throne room
294;00:22:49,891;00:22:51,891;at this very moment.
295;00:22:54,896;00:22:56,929;Where are you going?
296;00:22:59,834;00:23:01,901;To stand by my son.
297;00:23:02,003;00:23:04,670;Your place is in the gallery
298;00:23:04,773;00:23:07,440;with the other ladies of the court.
299;00:23:15,150;00:23:16,783;Your Grace...
300;00:23:34,803;00:23:37,136;Lords and ladies,
301;00:23:37,238;00:23:39,872;the Faith and the Crown
302;00:23:39,974;00:23:43,209;are the two pillars
302;00:23:39,974;00:23:43,209;that hold up this world.
303;00:23:43,311;00:23:46,946;One collapses, so does the other.
304;00:23:48,516;00:23:51,017;The Father judges us all.
305;00:23:51,119;00:23:52,552;If you break his laws...
306;00:23:55,423;00:23:57,690;you will be punished.
307;00:23:59,460;00:24:03,262;After conferring with His
307;00:23:59,460;00:24:03,262;Holiness the High Septon,
308;00:24:03,364;00:24:05,698;we have determined that Loras Tyrell
309;00:24:05,800;00:24:07,500;and Cersei Lannister's trial
310;00:24:07,602;00:24:09,669;will be held in
310;00:24:07,602;00:24:09,669;the Great Sept of Baelor
311;00:24:09,771;00:24:12,271;on the first day of the
311;00:24:09,771;00:24:12,271;Festival of the Mother.
312;00:24:18,646;00:24:21,647;Furthermore, after much prayer
313;00:24:21,749;00:24:23,816;and reflection,
314;00:24:23,918;00:24:27,019;the Crown has decided
314;00:24:23,918;00:24:27,019;that from this day forward,
315;00:24:27,121;00:24:29,088;trial by combat will be forbidden
316;00:24:29,190;00:24:31,224;throughout the Seven Kingdoms.
317;00:24:33,061;00:24:35,261;The tradition
317;00:24:33,061;00:24:35,261;is a brutish one,
318;00:24:35,363;00:24:37,330;a scheme devised by corrupt rulers
319;00:24:37,432;00:24:40,066;in order to avoid
319;00:24:37,432;00:24:40,066;true judgment from the gods.
320;00:24:40,168;00:24:42,668;Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell
321;00:24:42,770;00:24:44,737;will stand trial before seven septons
322;00:24:44,839;00:24:47,640;as it was in the earliest
322;00:24:44,839;00:24:47,640;days of the Faith.
323;00:24:47,742;00:24:49,876;Seven blessings to all.
324;00:24:49,978;00:24:51,844;Seven blessings.
325;00:25:14,235;00:25:16,702;Your Grace...
326;00:25:16,804;00:25:20,273;that old rumor you told me about.
327;00:25:21,910;00:25:24,277;My little birds investigated.
328;00:25:26,147;00:25:28,881;And?
329;00:25:28,983;00:25:32,084;Was it just a rumor
329;00:25:28,983;00:25:32,084;or something more?
330;00:25:32,186;00:25:33,819;More.
331;00:25:36,057;00:25:37,657;Much more.
332;00:25:43,631;00:25:45,831;You seem happy.
333;00:25:45,934;00:25:47,767;I am happy.
334;00:25:49,003;00:25:50,836;You should both be happy as well.
335;00:25:50,939;00:25:55,308;Not so long ago, this city
335;00:25:50,939;00:25:55,308;was ready to devour itself.
336;00:25:55,410;00:25:57,843;Now it's like a man reborn.
337;00:25:57,946;00:26:00,046;I will be happy
337;00:25:57,946;00:26:00,046;when our queen returns.
338;00:26:00,148;00:26:03,816;Why don't you drink? Why don't
338;00:26:00,148;00:26:03,816;either of you ever drink?
339;00:26:03,918;00:26:05,251;Unsullied never drink.
340;00:26:05,353;00:26:06,619;Why not?
340;00:26:05,353;00:26:06,619;Rules.
341;00:26:06,721;00:26:09,021;And who made these rules?
342;00:26:09,123;00:26:11,023;Your former masters?
343;00:26:11,125;00:26:14,193;Those miserable old shits
343;00:26:11,125;00:26:14,193;didn't want you to be human.
344;00:26:14,295;00:26:16,362;Have a drink with me.
345;00:26:19,334;00:26:22,601;And you?
345;00:26:19,334;00:26:22,601;What's your excuse?
346;00:26:23,638;00:26:25,137;I have tried wine before.
347;00:26:25,239;00:26:27,039;It made me feel funny.
348;00:26:27,141;00:26:29,108;That's how you know it's working.
349;00:26:31,579;00:26:34,080;Here's to our queen.
350;00:26:34,182;00:26:37,450;Anyone not drinking
350;00:26:34,182;00:26:37,450;is disrespecting our queen.
351;00:26:40,688;00:26:42,888;To Daenerys Stormborn,
351;00:26:40,688;00:26:42,888;Mother of Dragons,
352;00:26:42,991;00:26:45,691;Breaker of Chains,
352;00:26:42,991;00:26:45,691;long may she reign.
353;00:26:45,793;00:26:47,994;Long may she reign.
353;00:26:45,793;00:26:47,994;Long may she reign.
354;00:26:53,735;00:26:55,267;Do you like it?
355;00:26:55,370;00:26:57,403;Tastes like it has turned.
356;00:26:57,505;00:27:00,740;Yes, yes.
356;00:26:57,505;00:27:00,740;Fermentation.
357;00:27:04,312;00:27:08,914;One day, after our queen has
357;00:27:04,312;00:27:08,914;taken the Seven Kingdoms...
358;00:27:10,651;00:27:12,885;I'd like to have my own vineyard.
359;00:27:14,188;00:27:16,822;Make my own wine.
360;00:27:16,924;00:27:19,425;The Imp's Delight.
361;00:27:19,527;00:27:21,994;Only my close friends could drink it.
362;00:27:25,600;00:27:28,167;Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.
363;00:27:28,269;00:27:30,836;I do not know any jokes.
364;00:27:30,938;00:27:32,071;Grey Worm?
365;00:27:34,642;00:27:36,375;Right.
366;00:27:38,246;00:27:41,247;Three lords
366;00:27:38,246;00:27:41,247;walk into a tavern--
367;00:27:41,349;00:27:43,849;a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.
368;00:27:43,951;00:27:45,451;They order ale,
369;00:27:45,553;00:27:48,054;but when the barkeep
369;00:27:45,553;00:27:48,054;brings them over,
370;00:27:48,156;00:27:50,656;each of them finds a fly in his cup.
371;00:27:50,758;00:27:55,094;The Lannister, outraged, shoves the
371;00:27:50,758;00:27:55,094;cup aside and demands another.
372;00:27:55,196;00:27:59,365;The Martell plucks the fly
372;00:27:55,196;00:27:59,365;out and swallows it whole.
373;00:28:00,401;00:28:04,103;The Stark reaches into his cup,
374;00:28:04,205;00:28:07,006;pulls out the fly and shouts,
375;00:28:07,108;00:28:09,675;Spit it out, you wee shit.
376;00:28:09,777;00:28:11,110;Spit it out.
377;00:28:16,918;00:28:19,251;It's funnier in Westeros.
378;00:28:19,353;00:28:22,555;The Starks and the Lannisters,
378;00:28:19,353;00:28:22,555;I thought these were enemies.
379;00:28:22,657;00:28:23,689;Yes.
380;00:28:23,791;00:28:27,426;A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho.
381;00:28:27,528;00:28:29,662;Not a true story, necessarily.
382;00:28:29,764;00:28:32,765;A story that's supposed
382;00:28:29,764;00:28:32,765;to make you laugh ideally.
383;00:28:32,867;00:28:34,667;Not at the moment, perhaps.
384;00:28:34,769;00:28:37,169;Missandei, do you like the wine?
385;00:28:37,271;00:28:38,704;I do.
386;00:28:38,806;00:28:40,139;Tell a joke.
387;00:28:46,180;00:28:49,014;Two translators
387;00:28:46,180;00:28:49,014;are on a sinking ship.
388;00:28:50,751;00:28:52,718;The first says,
389;00:28:52,820;00:28:55,187;Do you know
389;00:28:52,820;00:28:55,187;how to swim?
390;00:28:55,289;00:28:59,758;The second says, No, but I can
390;00:28:55,289;00:28:59,758;shout for help in 19 languages.
391;00:29:02,797;00:29:05,364;Ah!
392;00:29:08,836;00:29:10,936;That is the worst joke I ever heard.
393;00:29:11,038;00:29:12,705;You don't even know what a joke is.
394;00:29:12,807;00:29:15,708;I am soldier all my life.
394;00:29:12,807;00:29:15,708;You think I never hear joke?
395;00:29:15,810;00:29:18,177;You lied to us.
396;00:29:19,747;00:29:21,113;I make joke.
397;00:29:31,726;00:29:33,092;More jokes.
398;00:29:33,194;00:29:35,561;I once walked into a brothel
399;00:29:35,663;00:29:37,296;with a honeycomb and a jackass.
400;00:29:37,398;00:29:40,065;The madam says--
401;00:29:52,313;00:29:54,980;The Masters have come
401;00:29:52,313;00:29:54,980;for their property.
402;00:30:13,067;00:30:14,433;Lord Edmure.
403;00:30:16,304;00:30:18,837;I apologize for the way
403;00:30:16,304;00:30:18,837;the Freys treated you.
404;00:30:18,940;00:30:21,207;A man of your birth deserves better.
405;00:30:21,309;00:30:25,277;You have my word you'll be properly
405;00:30:21,309;00:30:25,277;fed and clothed from now on.
406;00:30:27,281;00:30:29,248;I have your word?
407;00:30:31,452;00:30:33,852;Oh, good.
408;00:30:33,955;00:30:35,988;Good, that's--
409;00:30:36,090;00:30:38,057;that's a fine thing.
410;00:30:39,827;00:30:42,795;My uncle will never
410;00:30:39,827;00:30:42,795;surrender the castle, ser.
411;00:30:42,897;00:30:44,863;Whatever game you're playing.
412;00:30:44,966;00:30:46,832;The Blackfish is an old man.
413;00:30:46,934;00:30:49,034;A good death is all he can hope for.
414;00:30:49,136;00:30:52,204;But you, you have a
414;00:30:49,136;00:30:52,204;child now, I've heard.
415;00:30:53,641;00:30:56,141;A son you sired
415;00:30:53,641;00:30:56,141;on your wedding night.
416;00:30:56,244;00:30:58,043;You're a potent man.
417;00:30:58,145;00:31:00,479;A son I've never met
418;00:31:00,581;00:31:03,315;born of a wife that I haven't seen
419;00:31:03,417;00:31:04,750;since our first night together.
420;00:31:04,852;00:31:06,385;You should be with them both.
421;00:31:07,588;00:31:09,755;I can arrange that, you realize?
422;00:31:09,857;00:31:11,890;Comfortable rooms for you
422;00:31:09,857;00:31:11,890;at Casterly Rock.
423;00:31:11,993;00:31:15,194;A tutor for your boy, knights to
423;00:31:11,993;00:31:15,194;train him to fight and to ride.
424;00:31:15,296;00:31:17,730;And when he comes of age,
424;00:31:15,296;00:31:17,730;he'll have a keep of his own.
425;00:31:17,832;00:31:20,266;Do you imagine yourself
425;00:31:17,832;00:31:20,266;a decent person?
426;00:31:20,368;00:31:22,901;Is that it?
427;00:31:23,004;00:31:26,438;After you've massacred my family.
428;00:31:27,842;00:31:29,642;Kept me in a cell for years.
429;00:31:29,744;00:31:31,710;Stolen our lands.
430;00:31:31,812;00:31:34,380;I'll remind you that
430;00:31:31,812;00:31:34,380;our houses are at war.
431;00:31:34,482;00:31:36,615;I'm sorry if this conflict
431;00:31:34,482;00:31:36,615;has inconvenienced you,
432;00:31:36,717;00:31:39,218;but rebelling against the
432;00:31:36,717;00:31:39,218;Crown does have consequences.
433;00:31:39,320;00:31:41,560;Says the man who shoved his
433;00:31:39,320;00:31:41,560;sword through his king's back.
434;00:31:41,622;00:31:44,423;Did I give you the impression
434;00:31:41,622;00:31:44,423;that this was a negotiation?
435;00:31:44,525;00:31:45,758;It's not.
436;00:31:48,262;00:31:51,163;You understand. On some
436;00:31:48,262;00:31:51,163;level you understand
437;00:31:51,265;00:31:53,198;that you're an evil man.
438;00:31:53,301;00:31:54,933;I'll leave the judgments to the gods.
439;00:31:55,036;00:31:57,336;Well, that is convenient for you.
440;00:32:00,641;00:32:04,243;You're a fine-looking
440;00:32:00,641;00:32:04,243;fellow, aren't you?
441;00:32:06,847;00:32:09,415;Your square jaw,
442;00:32:09,517;00:32:11,283;your golden armor.
443;00:32:12,953;00:32:16,055;Tell me, I want to know.
444;00:32:16,157;00:32:17,723;I truly do.
445;00:32:17,825;00:32:19,291;How do you live with yourself?
446;00:32:23,030;00:32:25,164;All of us have to believe
447;00:32:25,266;00:32:28,267;that we're decent, don't we?
448;00:32:28,369;00:32:31,537;You have to sleep at night.
449;00:32:31,639;00:32:34,073;How do you tell yourself
450;00:32:34,175;00:32:36,775;that you're decent
451;00:32:36,877;00:32:39,378;after everything that you've done?
452;00:32:45,186;00:32:47,553;I was your sister's prisoner once.
453;00:32:50,825;00:32:54,293;She hit me on the head with a
453;00:32:50,825;00:32:54,293;rock if I remember correctly.
454;00:32:57,031;00:32:58,864;Yeah.
455;00:33:00,568;00:33:01,867;She should have killed you.
456;00:33:01,969;00:33:03,836;Perhaps, but she didn't.
457;00:33:05,239;00:33:08,974;Catelyn Stark hated me
457;00:33:05,239;00:33:08,974;just like you hate me.
458;00:33:09,076;00:33:11,343;But I didn't hate her.
459;00:33:11,445;00:33:13,011;I admired her.
460;00:33:13,114;00:33:14,980;Far more than her husband or her son.
461;00:33:15,082;00:33:17,349;Do you think I care whom you
461;00:33:15,082;00:33:17,349;admire and whom you don't?
462;00:33:17,451;00:33:20,091;No, I don't, but I'm telling you
462;00:33:17,451;00:33:20,091;anyway because you're my prisoner.
463;00:33:20,121;00:33:22,354;You don't have a choice.
464;00:33:22,456;00:33:24,456;The love she had for her children,
465;00:33:24,558;00:33:26,525;I was a little awed by it.
466;00:33:26,627;00:33:28,994;Reminded me of my sister.
467;00:33:29,096;00:33:32,231;Oh.
467;00:33:29,096;00:33:32,231;Oh, I see.
468;00:33:34,068;00:33:35,868;You're a madman.
469;00:33:35,970;00:33:37,836;I'm not here to trade insults.
470;00:33:37,938;00:33:40,439;Your sister was a strong--
470;00:33:37,938;00:33:40,439;Don't talk about Cat!
471;00:33:40,541;00:33:44,443;I'll talk about whomever I want.
472;00:33:45,479;00:33:47,546;She loved her children.
473;00:33:47,648;00:33:50,215;I suppose all mothers do,
474;00:33:50,317;00:33:53,051;but Catelyn and Cersei,
475;00:33:53,154;00:33:55,220;there's a fierceness
475;00:33:53,154;00:33:55,220;you don't often see.
476;00:33:55,322;00:33:58,123;They'd do anything
476;00:33:55,322;00:33:58,123;to protect their babies.
477;00:33:58,225;00:34:00,025;Start a war.
478;00:34:00,127;00:34:03,896;Burn cities to ash.
478;00:34:00,127;00:34:03,896;Free their worst enemies.
479;00:34:03,998;00:34:06,165;The things we do for love.
480;00:34:10,504;00:34:14,273;You didn't come here
480;00:34:10,504;00:34:14,273;to talk about our sisters.
481;00:34:14,375;00:34:17,276;That's exactly why I came here.
482;00:34:18,879;00:34:21,046;I love Cersei.
483;00:34:21,148;00:34:23,182;You can laugh at that if you want.
484;00:34:23,284;00:34:25,350;You can sneer.
484;00:34:23,284;00:34:25,350;Doesn't matter.
485;00:34:25,453;00:34:27,319;She needs me.
486;00:34:27,421;00:34:31,256;And to get back to her,
486;00:34:27,421;00:34:31,256;I have to take Riverrun.
487;00:34:34,695;00:34:37,830;I'll send for your baby boy.
488;00:34:37,932;00:34:41,200;And I'll launch him into
488;00:34:37,932;00:34:41,200;Riverrun with a catapult.
489;00:34:41,302;00:34:44,603;Because you don't matter
489;00:34:41,302;00:34:44,603;to me, Lord Edmure.
490;00:34:44,705;00:34:47,272;Your son doesn't matter to me.
491;00:34:47,374;00:34:51,043;The people in the castle
491;00:34:47,374;00:34:51,043;don't matter to me.
492;00:34:52,179;00:34:54,279;Only Cersei.
493;00:34:55,816;00:34:58,417;And if I have to
493;00:34:55,816;00:34:58,417;slaughter every Tully
494;00:34:58,519;00:35:01,587;who ever lived to get back to her,
495;00:35:01,689;00:35:04,189;that's what I'll do.
496;00:35:31,151;00:35:33,719;Who goes there?
497;00:35:33,821;00:35:35,554;Edmure Tully,
498;00:35:35,656;00:35:37,122;son of Hoster Tully
499;00:35:37,224;00:35:39,591;and the rightful Lord of Riverrun.
500;00:35:41,996;00:35:43,862;I demand entry.
501;00:35:43,964;00:35:46,765;Don't let him in.
502;00:35:46,867;00:35:49,234;He's the Lord of Riverrun.
503;00:35:49,336;00:35:50,569;I have to obey his commands.
504;00:35:50,671;00:35:52,271;He's been their captive
505;00:35:52,373;00:35:55,173;ever since they murdered
505;00:35:52,373;00:35:55,173;his king at the Red Wedding.
506;00:35:55,276;00:35:58,310;Why do you think the people who
506;00:35:55,276;00:35:58,310;murdered his king at the Red Wedding
507;00:35:58,412;00:36:01,680;would decide to let him come home?
508;00:36:01,782;00:36:04,950;Because it's a trap, you idiot.
509;00:36:05,052;00:36:06,351;Don't let him in.
510;00:36:06,453;00:36:08,153;He's my lord, my lord.
511;00:36:08,255;00:36:11,023;I've sworn to serve the Lord of
511;00:36:08,255;00:36:11,023;Riverrun and obey his commands.
512;00:36:11,125;00:36:13,926;You're not obeying Edmure's commands.
513;00:36:14,028;00:36:17,996;You're obeying the fucking
513;00:36:14,028;00:36:17,996;Kingslayer's commands.
514;00:36:18,098;00:36:20,766;I demand entry.
515;00:36:20,868;00:36:22,234;My lord has given an order.
516;00:36:22,336;00:36:24,336;With a knife to his throat.
517;00:36:24,438;00:36:26,872;That is not a valid order.
518;00:36:31,612;00:36:33,712;Lower the drawbridge and
518;00:36:31,612;00:36:33,712;open the gate for Lord Ed--
519;00:36:33,814;00:36:36,081;Aye, ser.
520;00:36:36,183;00:36:39,718;I'll have your head before
520;00:36:36,183;00:36:39,718;I surrender Riverrun.
521;00:36:39,820;00:36:43,488;You are not lord
521;00:36:39,820;00:36:43,488;of this castle, my lord.
522;00:36:55,202;00:36:58,070;Lower the drawbridge.
522;00:36:55,202;00:36:58,070;- Aye, ser!
523;00:37:42,516;00:37:44,182;If you're wrong,
524;00:37:44,284;00:37:47,953;we've just surrendered
524;00:37:44,284;00:37:47,953;our most valuable prisoner.
525;00:38:27,895;00:38:29,728;Welcome home, my lord.
526;00:38:34,468;00:38:37,703;Command all the forces within the
526;00:38:34,468;00:38:37,703;castle to lay down their arms.
527;00:38:39,840;00:38:41,573;Open the gates.
528;00:38:41,675;00:38:44,509;My lord--
528;00:38:41,675;00:38:44,509;Your lord has given a command.
529;00:39:18,512;00:39:21,546;Infantry, advance!
530;00:39:34,695;00:39:37,462;Find the Blackfish.
531;00:39:37,564;00:39:40,799;Put him in irons and hand
531;00:39:37,564;00:39:40,799;him over to the Freys.
532;00:39:44,638;00:39:46,471;Find him.
533;00:40:11,365;00:40:13,465;Go on.
534;00:40:13,567;00:40:14,800;Come with us.
535;00:40:14,902;00:40:16,434;I've run before from the Red Wedding.
536;00:40:16,537;00:40:18,837;I'm not running again.
536;00:40:16,537;00:40:18,837;This is my family home.
537;00:40:18,939;00:40:22,574;Your family is in the North.
537;00:40:18,939;00:40:22,574;Come with us.
538;00:40:22,676;00:40:25,710;Don't die for pride when you
538;00:40:22,676;00:40:25,710;can fight for your blood.
539;00:40:27,347;00:40:30,982;You'll serve Sansa far
539;00:40:27,347;00:40:30,982;better than I ever could.
540;00:40:36,123;00:40:37,656;All the way down!
541;00:40:37,758;00:40:40,559;Check that out!
541;00:40:37,758;00:40:40,559;Go on, now.
542;00:40:40,661;00:40:43,662;I haven't had a proper
542;00:40:40,661;00:40:43,662;sword fight in years.
543;00:40:43,764;00:40:46,498;I expect I'll make
543;00:40:43,764;00:40:46,498;a damn fool of myself.
544;00:41:20,534;00:41:23,268;We found the Blackfish, my lord.
545;00:41:23,370;00:41:24,936;Good.
546;00:41:25,038;00:41:27,339;Bring him to me.
547;00:41:27,441;00:41:29,841;He died fighting, my lord.
548;00:43:00,067;00:43:02,167;I was wrong. I admit it.
548;00:43:00,067;00:43:02,167;That changes nothing.
549;00:43:02,269;00:43:04,669;The Unsullied could mount
549;00:43:02,269;00:43:04,669;a defense off the beachhead.
550;00:43:04,771;00:43:05,825;If the slavers' forces--
551;00:43:05,945;00:43:07,855;No more talking from you.
551;00:43:05,945;00:43:07,855;Your talking gave us this.
552;00:43:07,975;00:43:09,615;And I have acknowledged that.
552;00:43:07,975;00:43:09,615;I'm trying--
553;00:43:09,643;00:43:11,563;You're trying to tell me
553;00:43:09,643;00:43:11,563;what the army should do.
554;00:43:11,645;00:43:14,079;You do not know
554;00:43:11,645;00:43:14,079;what the army should do.
555;00:43:14,181;00:43:16,348;All right, what should the army do?
556;00:43:16,450;00:43:18,216;We'll not go to the beach.
557;00:43:18,318;00:43:20,618;If we go to the beach, the
557;00:43:18,318;00:43:20,618;Masters will take the pyramid.
558;00:43:20,721;00:43:23,154;The pyramid is the only place
558;00:43:20,721;00:43:23,154;in the city we can defend.
559;00:43:23,256;00:43:24,689;We stay here.
559;00:43:23,256;00:43:24,689;And then?
560;00:43:24,791;00:43:26,591;We wait for them to come to us.
561;00:43:26,693;00:43:28,893;Then we fight them.
562;00:44:39,066;00:44:40,765;Clegane.
563;00:44:40,867;00:44:42,967;What the fuck you doing here?
564;00:44:43,070;00:44:45,170;Chasing them.
564;00:44:43,070;00:44:45,170;You?
565;00:44:45,272;00:44:47,105;Hanging them.
566;00:44:47,207;00:44:48,907;Any particular reason?
567;00:44:49,009;00:44:51,376;They're our men.
567;00:44:49,009;00:44:51,376;Or they were.
568;00:44:51,478;00:44:54,045;They attacked a nearby sept
568;00:44:51,478;00:44:54,045;and murdered the villagers.
569;00:44:54,147;00:44:55,313;Why do you want them?
570;00:44:55,415;00:44:56,915;Same reason.
571;00:44:57,017;00:44:59,050;I was helping build it.
572;00:44:59,152;00:45:01,386;They killed a friend of mine.
573;00:45:01,488;00:45:02,754;You've got friends?
574;00:45:02,856;00:45:05,723;Not anymore.
574;00:45:02,856;00:45:05,723;They're mine.
575;00:45:05,826;00:45:08,426;It's the Brotherhood's good name
575;00:45:05,826;00:45:08,426;they've dragged through the dirt.
576;00:45:08,462;00:45:10,161;Fuck your name.
576;00:45:08,462;00:45:10,161;They're mine.
577;00:45:10,263;00:45:11,796;I killed you once before, Dondarrion.
578;00:45:11,898;00:45:13,865;Happy to do it again.
579;00:45:13,967;00:45:16,234;Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.
580;00:45:17,637;00:45:20,071;Tougher girls than you
580;00:45:17,637;00:45:20,071;have tried to kill me.
581;00:45:22,342;00:45:23,641;You can have one of them.
582;00:45:28,482;00:45:29,848;Two.
583;00:45:41,595;00:45:43,595;No, no, no.
584;00:45:43,697;00:45:46,164;We're not butchers.
584;00:45:43,697;00:45:46,164;We hang them.
585;00:45:46,266;00:45:47,899;Hanging?
586;00:45:48,001;00:45:49,400;All over in an instant.
587;00:45:49,503;00:45:50,935;Where's the punishment in that?
588;00:45:51,037;00:45:53,638;They die.
588;00:45:51,037;00:45:53,638;We all bloody die.
589;00:45:53,740;00:45:56,207;Except this one here.
590;00:45:56,309;00:45:58,376;I'll only gut one of them.
591;00:45:58,478;00:46:00,912;No.
592;00:46:01,014;00:46:02,780;I'll chop off one hand.
593;00:46:02,883;00:46:05,950;We gave you two of the three
593;00:46:02,883;00:46:05,950;out of respect for your loss.
594;00:46:06,052;00:46:07,452;That's generous.
595;00:46:11,224;00:46:14,292;Bunch of nancies.
596;00:46:14,394;00:46:16,895;There was a time I would
596;00:46:14,394;00:46:16,895;have killed all seven of you
597;00:46:16,997;00:46:18,163;just to gut these three.
598;00:46:18,265;00:46:19,564;You're getting old, Clegane.
599;00:46:19,666;00:46:21,132;He's not.
600;00:46:23,236;00:46:25,770;Please don't.
600;00:46:23,236;00:46:25,770;I'll give you anything.
601;00:46:54,367;00:46:56,234;Got anything to eat?
602;00:47:08,515;00:47:10,682;Enjoying yourself?
603;00:47:10,784;00:47:12,850;I prefer chicken.
604;00:47:14,287;00:47:17,622;You ought to join us.
604;00:47:14,287;00:47:17,622;We could use you.
605;00:47:18,925;00:47:21,392;I tried joining.
605;00:47:18,925;00:47:21,392;Didn't work out for me.
606;00:47:21,494;00:47:24,429;Clegane, we're here for a reason.
607;00:47:25,999;00:47:29,367;The Lord of Light is keeping
607;00:47:25,999;00:47:29,367;Beric alive for a reason.
608;00:47:29,469;00:47:31,836;He gave a failed, drunk priest
609;00:47:31,938;00:47:34,672;the power to bring him
609;00:47:31,938;00:47:34,672;back for a reason.
610;00:47:34,774;00:47:37,108;We are part of something
610;00:47:34,774;00:47:37,108;larger than ourselves.
611;00:47:37,210;00:47:40,378;Lots of horrible shit
611;00:47:37,210;00:47:40,378;in this world gets done
612;00:47:40,480;00:47:42,547;for something larger than ourselves.
613;00:47:49,856;00:47:52,857;Cold winds are rising in the North.
614;00:47:52,959;00:47:55,260;And you're going to go stop them?
615;00:47:56,396;00:47:57,929;We need good men to help us.
616;00:47:58,031;00:48:01,799;Last time you saw me,
616;00:47:58,031;00:48:01,799;you wanted to execute me.
617;00:48:03,436;00:48:05,036;True enough.
618;00:48:05,138;00:48:08,206;But the Lord of Light gave
618;00:48:05,138;00:48:08,206;you the power to defeat me.
619;00:48:08,308;00:48:10,808;Why?
620;00:48:10,910;00:48:13,811;I beat you because I'm
620;00:48:10,910;00:48:13,811;better than you, Beric.
621;00:48:13,913;00:48:18,149;I was better than you before you
621;00:48:13,913;00:48:18,149;started yammering on about the Lord
622;00:48:18,251;00:48:21,219;and I'm better than you now.
623;00:48:21,321;00:48:23,121;Aye, you're probably right.
624;00:48:23,223;00:48:26,057;You're a fighter.
625;00:48:26,159;00:48:28,393;You were born a fighter.
626;00:48:28,495;00:48:30,895;You walked away from the fight.
627;00:48:30,997;00:48:32,664;How did that go?
628;00:48:35,468;00:48:38,736;Good and bad, young and old,
629;00:48:38,838;00:48:41,606;the things we're fighting
629;00:48:38,838;00:48:41,606;will destroy them all alike.
630;00:48:43,443;00:48:46,678;You can still help a lot more
630;00:48:43,443;00:48:46,678;than you've harmed, Clegane.
631;00:48:46,780;00:48:48,680;It's not too late for you.
632;00:49:52,479;00:49:54,278;Lady Crane?
633;00:50:02,522;00:50:04,389;Lady Crane?
634;00:50:10,663;00:50:14,432;If you'd have done your job, she
634;00:50:10,663;00:50:14,432;would have died painlessly.
635;00:50:16,669;00:50:18,770;Instead...
636;00:50:20,840;00:50:23,307;The Many-Faced God
636;00:50:20,840;00:50:23,307;was promised a name.
637;00:50:24,711;00:50:26,811;He must always receive what is his.
638;00:50:26,913;00:50:29,614;You can't change that.
639;00:50:29,716;00:50:32,150;I can't change that.
640;00:50:32,252;00:50:34,285;No one can.
641;00:50:36,923;00:50:39,390;And now he's been
641;00:50:36,923;00:50:39,390;promised another name.
642;00:50:54,941;00:50:57,141;Hey!
642;00:50:54,941;00:50:57,141;Get out!
643;00:51:00,013;00:51:01,946;Yah!
644;00:52:21,461;00:52:23,194;Hey!
645;00:52:25,999;00:52:27,832;Yah!
646;00:52:28,902;00:52:30,434;Ah!
647;00:52:42,549;00:52:44,882;My basket!
648;00:54:18,911;00:54:20,478;It will all be over soon.
649;00:54:21,914;00:54:24,715;On your knees or on your feet?
650;00:54:35,461;00:54:37,695;Haven't we been through this already?
651;00:54:39,866;00:54:41,632;That won't help you.
652;00:55:53,339;00:55:55,372;You told her to kill me.
653;00:56:02,081;00:56:03,714;Yes.
654;00:56:03,816;00:56:06,283;But here you are.
655;00:56:06,385;00:56:09,086;And there she is.
656;00:56:19,298;00:56:22,166;Finally a girl is no one.
657;00:56:25,571;00:56:29,073;A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell
658;00:56:29,175;00:56:31,308;and I'm going home.
