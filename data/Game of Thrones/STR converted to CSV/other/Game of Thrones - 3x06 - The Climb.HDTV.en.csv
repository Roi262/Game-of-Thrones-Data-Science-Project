1;00:03:49,210;00:03:51,945;You've got too much
1;00:03:49,210;00:03:51,945;wood in there.
2;00:03:51,980;00:03:55,615;But the more wood,
2;00:03:51,980;00:03:55,615;the bigger the fire.
3;00:03:55,649;00:03:57,751;It needs to breathe.
4;00:03:57,785;00:03:59,720;Take off that big log.
5;00:04:09,098;00:04:12,601;Huh.
5;00:04:09,098;00:04:12,601;You know your fires.
6;00:04:20,410;00:04:24,113;Someone built your fires
6;00:04:20,410;00:04:24,113;for you growing up?
7;00:04:24,147;00:04:27,016;It doesn't get so cold
7;00:04:24,147;00:04:27,016;down in the Reach.
8;00:04:28,218;00:04:30,886;And there were
8;00:04:28,218;00:04:30,886;servants, of course.
9;00:04:30,921;00:04:33,189;I knew you were highborn.
10;00:04:36,726;00:04:40,596;Oh, I found something
10;00:04:36,726;00:04:40,596;at the Fist of the First Men.
11;00:04:43,299;00:04:45,133;Buried treasure.
12;00:04:45,168;00:04:47,670;Thousands of years old.
13;00:04:47,704;00:04:49,304;I think.
14;00:04:50,473;00:04:52,408;What does it do?
15;00:04:53,643;00:04:56,144;I'm not sure
15;00:04:53,643;00:04:56,144;that it does anything.
16;00:04:56,179;00:04:58,380;It's beautiful, though,
16;00:04:56,179;00:04:58,380;isn't it?
17;00:05:06,456;00:05:09,658;How much longer?
17;00:05:06,456;00:05:09,658;Not so far.
18;00:05:09,692;00:05:11,860;A few more days.
19;00:05:11,894;00:05:15,231;Is the Wall
19;00:05:11,894;00:05:15,231;as big as they say?
20;00:05:15,265;00:05:17,133;Bigger.
21;00:05:18,402;00:05:21,371;So big you can't even see
21;00:05:18,402;00:05:21,371;the top sometimes.
22;00:05:21,405;00:05:23,407;It's hidden in clouds.
23;00:05:25,276;00:05:26,777;You're playing with me.
24;00:05:26,811;00:05:30,982;I'm not.
24;00:05:26,811;00:05:30,982;It's 700 feet high,
25;00:05:31,016;00:05:33,318;all made of ice.
26;00:05:33,386;00:05:36,021;On a warm day
26;00:05:33,386;00:05:36,021;you can see it weeping.

27;00:05:40,627;00:05:43,929;is nice enough.
28;00:05:43,963;00:05:47,299;They keep a fire burning
28;00:05:43,963;00:05:47,299;in the long hall
29;00:05:47,333;00:05:49,068;day and night.
30;00:05:49,102;00:05:53,239;And Hobb makes
30;00:05:49,102;00:05:53,239;venison stew
31;00:05:53,273;00:05:55,040;with onions.
32;00:05:55,075;00:05:56,475;Very tasty.
33;00:05:56,510;00:06:00,813;Sometimes, one of

36;00:06:05,551;00:06:08,353;No, no, no.
36;00:06:05,551;00:06:08,353;Not very well.
37;00:06:10,590;00:06:12,925;Sing me a song.
38;00:06:12,959;00:06:16,562;Oh, all right.

110;00:10:56,541;00:10:59,610;Here, sit down.
110;00:10:56,541;00:10:59,610;I brought a pair for you.
111;00:11:00,979;00:11:03,914;They're too big for you,
111;00:11:00,979;00:11:03,914;but they're good.

115;00:11:09,821;00:11:12,189;are still bruised.
116;00:11:18,964;00:11:21,833;He wasn't good to me
116;00:11:18,964;00:11:21,833;the way you're good to me.
117;00:11:23,202;00:11:26,471;He didn't do that thing
117;00:11:23,202;00:11:26,471;you do with your tongue.
118;00:11:27,606;00:11:29,274;Can we not talk

131;00:12:00,274;00:12:02,075;Do you think I'm as dumb
131;00:12:00,274;00:12:02,075;as all those girls
132;00:12:02,110;00:12:06,045;in silk dresses
132;00:12:02,110;00:12:06,045;you knew growing up?
133;00:12:06,080;00:12:09,015;You're loyal
133;00:12:06,080;00:12:09,015;and you're brave.
134;00:12:13,120;00:12:14,887;You didn't stop
134;00:12:13,120;00:12:14,887;being a crow
135;00:12:14,922;00:12:17,623;the day you walked
135;00:12:14,922;00:12:17,623;into Mance Rayder's tent.
136;00:12:24,231;00:12:26,666;But I'm your woman now,
136;00:12:24,231;00:12:26,666;Jon Snow.
137;00:12:28,769;00:12:32,172;You're going to be loyal
137;00:12:28,769;00:12:32,172;to your woman.
138;00:12:37,011;00:12:39,847;The Night's Watch
138;00:12:37,011;00:12:39,847;don't care if you live or die.
139;00:12:39,881;00:12:43,250;Mance Rayder don't care
139;00:12:39,881;00:12:43,250;if I live or die.
140;00:12:43,284;00:12:44,852;We're just soldiers
140;00:12:43,284;00:12:44,852;in their armies
141;00:12:44,886;00:12:47,188;and there's plenty more
141;00:12:44,886;00:12:47,188;to carry on if we go down.
142;00:12:54,830;00:12:57,399;It's you and me
143;00:12:57,433;00:13:00,502;that matters
143;00:12:57,433;00:13:00,502;to me and you.
144;00:13:04,140;00:13:06,474;Don't ever betray me.
145;00:13:13,883;00:13:15,283;I won't.
146;00:13:15,318;00:13:18,386;'Cause I'll cut
146;00:13:15,318;00:13:18,386;your pretty cock right off
147;00:13:18,421;00:13:20,722;and wear it
147;00:13:18,421;00:13:20,722;'round my neck.
148;00:13:32,466;00:13:34,300;Sink your metal deep
149;00:13:34,335;00:13:37,870;and make sure it holds
149;00:13:34,335;00:13:37,870;before taking your next step.
150;00:13:38,772;00:13:40,406;And if you fall,
151;00:13:40,441;00:13:42,175;don't scream.
152;00:13:42,209;00:13:45,846;You don't want that to be the
152;00:13:42,209;00:13:45,846;last thing she remembers.
153;00:13:58,528;00:14:00,128;Joffrey.
154;00:14:03,832;00:14:06,134;Cersei.
155;00:14:06,168;00:14:08,036;Ilyn Payne.
156;00:14:09,305;00:14:11,172;You're good.
157;00:14:15,378;00:14:18,513;You're not as good
157;00:14:15,378;00:14:18,513;as you think you are.
158;00:14:20,216;00:14:22,850;Face, tits, balls--
159;00:14:22,885;00:14:24,452;I hit 'em right
159;00:14:22,885;00:14:24,452;where I wanted to.
160;00:14:24,487;00:14:28,222;Aye, but you took
160;00:14:24,487;00:14:28,222;your sweet time of it.
161;00:14:28,256;00:14:31,759;You won't be fighting
161;00:14:28,256;00:14:31,759;straw men, little lady.
162;00:14:33,695;00:14:36,029;Show me your position.
163;00:14:38,799;00:14:40,600;Keep your elbow high.
164;00:14:40,634;00:14:43,603;You want your back
164;00:14:40,634;00:14:43,603;doing the hard labor.
165;00:14:45,572;00:14:47,539;You're holding.
166;00:14:47,574;00:14:49,308;Never hold.
167;00:14:49,342;00:14:52,277;What?
167;00:14:49,342;00:14:52,277;Your muscles tense up when you hold.
168;00:14:52,311;00:14:54,579;Pull the string back
168;00:14:52,311;00:14:54,579;to the center of your chin
169;00:14:54,613;00:14:56,080;and release.
170;00:14:56,114;00:14:58,015;Never hold.
171;00:14:58,050;00:15:00,084;But I have to aim.
172;00:15:00,118;00:15:01,786;Never aim.
173;00:15:01,820;00:15:03,387;Never aim?
174;00:15:03,422;00:15:07,158;Your eye knows where
174;00:15:03,422;00:15:07,158;it wants the arrow to go.
175;00:15:07,192;00:15:09,393;Trust your eye.
176;00:15:13,465;00:15:15,599;There's someone out there.
177;00:15:33,584;00:15:36,653;That's about far enough.
178;00:15:41,425;00:15:42,792;We come as friends.
179;00:15:42,826;00:15:44,627;Begging
179;00:15:42,826;00:15:44,627;your pardon, m'lady,
180;00:15:44,661;00:15:46,762;but we'll be
180;00:15:44,661;00:15:46,762;the judge of that.
181;00:15:49,065;00:15:50,732;Valar morghulis.
182;00:15:50,767;00:15:52,801;Valar dohaeris.
183;00:16:28,671;00:16:31,607;My friends here
183;00:16:28,671;00:16:31,607;don't speak High Valyrian.
184;00:16:33,243;00:16:35,377;Why are you here,
184;00:16:33,243;00:16:35,377;my lady?
185;00:16:47,991;00:16:50,092;Forgive my manners.
186;00:16:51,194;00:16:53,128;I don't see many ladies
186;00:16:51,194;00:16:53,128;these days.
187;00:16:53,163;00:16:55,030;Lucky for the ladies.
188;00:17:24,493;00:17:26,594;How many times has
188;00:17:24,493;00:17:26,594;the Lord brought him back?
189;00:17:26,629;00:17:28,463;Six.
190;00:17:53,957;00:17:56,359;I've always been
190;00:17:53,957;00:17:56,359;a terrible priest.
191;00:17:57,661;00:18:00,263;Drank too much rum.
192;00:18:00,297;00:18:02,398;Fucked all the whores
192;00:18:00,297;00:18:02,398;in King's Landing.
193;00:18:02,432;00:18:05,134;It's a terrible
193;00:18:02,432;00:18:05,134;thing to say,
194;00:18:05,168;00:18:09,070;but by the time I came
194;00:18:05,168;00:18:09,070;to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord.
195;00:18:11,807;00:18:14,575;I decided that He,
195;00:18:11,807;00:18:14,575;that all the gods,
196;00:18:14,610;00:18:18,146;were stories we told
196;00:18:14,610;00:18:18,146;the children to make them behave.
197;00:18:19,948;00:18:22,918;So I wore the robes and every now
197;00:18:19,948;00:18:22,918;and then I'd recite the prayers,
198;00:18:22,952;00:18:26,021;but it was just for show.
199;00:18:27,791;00:18:30,760;A spectacle
199;00:18:27,791;00:18:30,760;for the locals.
200;00:18:30,794;00:18:34,230;Until the Mountain drove a lance
200;00:18:30,794;00:18:34,230;through this one's heart.
201;00:18:38,469;00:18:41,772;I knelt beside
201;00:18:38,469;00:18:41,772;his cold body
202;00:18:41,806;00:18:43,607;and said the old words.
203;00:18:43,641;00:18:46,343;Not because I believed
203;00:18:43,641;00:18:46,343;in them, but...
204;00:18:48,713;00:18:51,616;he was my friend
205;00:18:51,650;00:18:53,952;and he was dead.
206;00:18:55,154;00:18:57,089;And they were
206;00:18:55,154;00:18:57,089;the only words I knew.
207;00:18:58,624;00:19:01,626;And for the first time
207;00:18:58,624;00:19:01,626;in my life, the Lord replied.
208;00:19:03,862;00:19:05,963;Beric's eyes opened
209;00:19:05,998;00:19:08,732;and I knew the truth.
210;00:19:08,767;00:19:11,769;Our god
210;00:19:08,767;00:19:11,769;is the one true god.
211;00:19:14,105;00:19:16,506;And all men
211;00:19:14,105;00:19:16,506;must serve Him.
212;00:19:23,581;00:19:26,584;You've been
212;00:19:23,581;00:19:26,584;to the other side.
213;00:19:27,452;00:19:29,587;The other side?
214;00:19:30,689;00:19:33,491;There is no other side.
215;00:19:34,593;00:19:37,194;I have been
215;00:19:34,593;00:19:37,194;to the darkness, my lady.
216;00:19:41,166;00:19:44,002;He sent you to us
216;00:19:41,166;00:19:44,002;for a reason.
217;00:19:45,471;00:19:47,806;You have someone
217;00:19:45,471;00:19:47,806;He needs.
218;00:19:49,242;00:19:51,677;Bodkin point.
219;00:19:51,711;00:19:54,614;Penetrates plate
219;00:19:51,711;00:19:54,614;at 200 yards.
220;00:19:58,452;00:20:00,487;Can you make 'em?
221;00:20:00,521;00:20:02,889;Yeah, nothing tricky
221;00:20:00,521;00:20:02,889;about it.
222;00:20:02,924;00:20:05,225;Just need decent steel.
223;00:20:05,259;00:20:06,559;I'll get you the steel.
224;00:20:06,594;00:20:08,829;Come on.
225;00:20:10,365;00:20:12,099;I don't like that woman.
226;00:20:14,403;00:20:16,971;That's 'cause
226;00:20:14,403;00:20:16,971;you're a girl.
227;00:20:17,005;00:20:18,739;What does that have
227;00:20:17,005;00:20:18,739;to do with anything?
228;00:20:25,013;00:20:26,613;Forgive me, lad.
229;00:20:30,718;00:20:33,486;What are you doing?
229;00:20:30,718;00:20:33,486;Let go of him.
230;00:20:33,521;00:20:35,155;Tell them to stop.
230;00:20:33,521;00:20:35,155;Come on.
231;00:20:35,189;00:20:36,989;He wants to be one of you.
232;00:20:37,024;00:20:39,291;He wants to join the Brotherhood.
232;00:20:37,024;00:20:39,291;Stop them!
233;00:20:39,326;00:20:41,493;We serve
233;00:20:39,326;00:20:41,493;the Lord of Light
234;00:20:41,528;00:20:43,729;and the Lord of Light
234;00:20:41,528;00:20:43,729;needs this boy.
235;00:20:43,763;00:20:46,365;Did the Lord of Light
235;00:20:43,763;00:20:46,365;tell you that or did she?
236;00:20:52,372;00:20:55,474;You're not doing this
236;00:20:52,372;00:20:55,474;for your god.
237;00:20:55,508;00:20:57,176;You're doing it for gold.
238;00:20:57,210;00:20:59,378;We're doing it
238;00:20:57,210;00:20:59,378;for both, girl.
239;00:21:00,747;00:21:02,582;We can't defend the people
239;00:21:00,747;00:21:02,582;without weapons
240;00:21:02,616;00:21:04,884;and horses and food.
241;00:21:04,919;00:21:08,589;And we can't get weapons
241;00:21:04,919;00:21:08,589;and horses and food without gold.
242;00:21:08,623;00:21:11,558;You told me
242;00:21:08,623;00:21:11,558;this was a Brotherhood.
243;00:21:11,592;00:21:14,061;You told me
243;00:21:11,592;00:21:14,061;I could be one of you.
244;00:21:20,536;00:21:22,704;You are more
244;00:21:20,536;00:21:22,704;than they can ever be.
245;00:21:22,738;00:21:25,606;They're just foot soldiers
245;00:21:22,738;00:21:25,606;in the great war.
246;00:21:25,641;00:21:28,276;You will make kings
246;00:21:25,641;00:21:28,276;rise and fall.
247;00:21:40,055;00:21:43,224;You're a witch.
247;00:21:40,055;00:21:43,224;You're going to hurt him.
248;00:21:48,297;00:21:50,498;I see a darkness in you.
249;00:21:52,134;00:21:54,969;And in that darkness,
249;00:21:52,134;00:21:54,969;eyes staring back at me--
250;00:21:55,004;00:21:57,005;brown eyes,
251;00:21:57,039;00:22:00,309;blue eyes,
251;00:21:57,039;00:22:00,309;green eyes.
252;00:22:00,343;00:22:03,512;Eyes you'll shut forever.
253;00:22:06,951;00:22:09,052;We will meet again.
254;00:23:24,331;00:23:26,999;You staring at my ass,
254;00:23:24,331;00:23:26,999;Jon Snow?
255;00:23:37,110;00:23:38,777;You all right?
256;00:23:42,248;00:23:44,749;Just seeing if you can
256;00:23:42,248;00:23:44,749;take a hit, lad.
257;00:23:58,364;00:24:01,466;Sorry.
257;00:23:58,364;00:24:01,466;Were you sleeping?
258;00:24:01,500;00:24:03,568;Wa--
259;00:24:05,204;00:24:08,640;Wa--? Wa--?
260;00:24:09,776;00:24:11,577;Water?
261;00:24:11,611;00:24:13,646;You want some water.
262;00:24:16,183;00:24:18,718;I wish I had
262;00:24:16,183;00:24:18,718;some for you.
263;00:24:32,701;00:24:35,102;So let's play a game.
264;00:24:36,271;00:24:39,507;Which body part
264;00:24:36,271;00:24:39,507;do you need the least?
265;00:24:41,110;00:24:44,579;Please.
265;00:24:41,110;00:24:44,579;Please is not a body part.
266;00:24:44,614;00:24:46,915;I'll tell you everything,
266;00:24:44,614;00:24:46,915;please.
267;00:24:46,949;00:24:51,486;But you've already
267;00:24:46,949;00:24:51,486;told me everything.
268;00:24:51,521;00:24:54,022;Remember?
269;00:24:54,056;00:24:56,492;Your daddy
269;00:24:54,056;00:24:56,492;was mean to you.
270;00:24:56,526;00:24:59,862;The Starks didn't
270;00:24:56,526;00:24:59,862;appreciate you.
271;00:25:00,930;00:25:03,499;One good bit, though.
272;00:25:03,533;00:25:05,734;The Stark boys,
273;00:25:05,768;00:25:08,470;they're still alive.
274;00:25:09,605;00:25:13,607;Wouldn't that be
274;00:25:09,605;00:25:13,607;a hunt to remember?
275;00:25:13,641;00:25:17,578;You failed, but I'm a better
275;00:25:13,641;00:25:17,578;hunter than you.
276;00:25:19,314;00:25:21,315;Now...
277;00:25:21,349;00:25:23,317;how about
277;00:25:21,349;00:25:23,317;your little finger?
278;00:25:23,352;00:25:25,186;You don't use that
278;00:25:23,352;00:25:25,186;for much, do you?
279;00:25:25,220;00:25:28,389;No? Good.
279;00:25:25,220;00:25:28,389;Let's start with that.
280;00:25:38,434;00:25:41,102;You've been wondering
280;00:25:38,434;00:25:41,102;why you're here.
281;00:25:41,136;00:25:43,638;Haven't you?
282;00:25:43,672;00:25:45,506;Where you are.
283;00:25:45,541;00:25:47,308;Who I am.
284;00:25:47,343;00:25:50,144;Why I'm doing
284;00:25:47,343;00:25:50,144;this to you.
285;00:25:51,747;00:25:53,982;So guess.
286;00:25:54,016;00:25:56,251;If you guess right,
287;00:25:56,285;00:25:57,852;I'll tell you.
288;00:25:57,887;00:26:00,855;By the old gods
288;00:25:57,887;00:26:00,855;and the new, I swear it.
289;00:26:02,791;00:26:04,292;You win the game
290;00:26:04,326;00:26:06,394;if you can
290;00:26:04,326;00:26:06,394;figure out who I am
291;00:26:06,428;00:26:07,962;and why
291;00:26:06,428;00:26:07,962;I'm torturing you
292;00:26:07,997;00:26:11,332;and I win the game if you beg
292;00:26:07,997;00:26:11,332;me to cut off your finger.
293;00:26:13,235;00:26:17,005;If I win,
293;00:26:13,235;00:26:17,005;you'll let me go?
294;00:26:19,041;00:26:21,809;If you think this has
294;00:26:19,041;00:26:21,809;a happy ending,
295;00:26:21,843;00:26:24,845;you haven't been
295;00:26:21,843;00:26:24,845;paying attention.
296;00:26:24,879;00:26:26,513;Please.
297;00:26:26,548;00:26:30,484;You say please again
297;00:26:26,548;00:26:30,484;and you'll wish you hadn't.
298;00:26:33,921;00:26:36,089;You first.
299;00:26:36,123;00:26:38,224;Where are we?
300;00:26:39,226;00:26:41,828;The North.
300;00:26:39,226;00:26:41,828;Too vague.
301;00:26:41,862;00:26:43,496;Deepwood Motte.
302;00:26:45,733;00:26:47,967;Terrible guess.
303;00:26:55,643;00:26:58,178;Now, where?
304;00:26:59,114;00:27:01,182;Last Hearth.
305;00:27:01,216;00:27:04,285;Do I look like
305;00:27:01,216;00:27:04,285;a fucking Umber to you?
306;00:27:07,389;00:27:09,490;Karhold!
307;00:27:16,297;00:27:18,031;Karhold?
308;00:27:20,835;00:27:22,769;How did you know that?
309;00:27:24,172;00:27:27,208;Did you see any banners
309;00:27:24,172;00:27:27,208;flying when we came in?
310;00:27:27,242;00:27:28,842;No.
311;00:27:28,877;00:27:31,445;It was just a guess.
312;00:27:31,480;00:27:34,983;Very good, Lord Theon.
313;00:27:37,520;00:27:38,920;And who am I?
314;00:27:40,156;00:27:42,123;Torrhen Karstark.
315;00:27:42,158;00:27:44,059;He's dead.
316;00:27:44,093;00:27:46,695;Strangled by
316;00:27:44,093;00:27:46,695;the Kingslayer.
317;00:27:48,497;00:27:51,032;He was your brother.
318;00:27:55,370;00:27:59,807;Your father
318;00:27:55,370;00:27:59,807;is Lord Rickard Karstark.
319;00:28:08,349;00:28:11,584;You swore to tell me if I--
319;00:28:08,349;00:28:11,584;You're right.
320;00:28:13,420;00:28:17,256;Lord Rickard Karstark
320;00:28:13,420;00:28:17,256;is Robb Stark's bannerman.
321;00:28:17,290;00:28:19,224;I betrayed Robb.
322;00:28:19,259;00:28:22,861;That's why you're
322;00:28:19,259;00:28:22,861;torturing me.
323;00:28:25,031;00:28:26,832;Yes.
324;00:28:30,303;00:28:32,004;You win.
325;00:28:42,382;00:28:46,051;Of course, you forgot
325;00:28:42,382;00:28:46,051;to ask one question.
326;00:28:46,085;00:28:49,588;You forgot to ask
326;00:28:46,085;00:28:49,588;if I'm a liar.
327;00:28:55,362;00:28:57,997;I'm afraid I am.
328;00:28:59,966;00:29:03,202;Everything I told you
328;00:28:59,966;00:29:03,202;is a lie.
329;00:29:05,906;00:29:08,709;This isn't happening
329;00:29:05,906;00:29:08,709;to you for a reason.
330;00:29:08,743;00:29:12,479;Well, one reason--
330;00:29:08,743;00:29:12,479;I enjoy it.
331;00:29:12,514;00:29:15,750;Please, cut it off!
331;00:29:12,514;00:29:15,750;Cut it off! Cut it off!
332;00:29:21,890;00:29:23,491;I win.
333;00:29:23,525;00:29:26,194;Thank you for riding
333;00:29:23,525;00:29:26,194;here so quickly.
334;00:29:26,228;00:29:28,729;I know travel
334;00:29:26,228;00:29:28,729;isn't easy in these times.
335;00:29:28,764;00:29:31,499;The roads are crawling
335;00:29:28,764;00:29:31,499;with cutthroats and bandits.
336;00:29:31,533;00:29:35,003;But when the King
336;00:29:31,533;00:29:35,003;of the North summons us, we come.
337;00:29:35,037;00:29:37,438;Our father has
337;00:29:35,037;00:29:37,438;instructed us to tell you
338;00:29:37,473;00:29:40,208;that his alliance
338;00:29:37,473;00:29:40,208;with the North can continue
339;00:29:40,242;00:29:42,911;if his terms are met.
340;00:29:42,945;00:29:45,880;Lord Frey requires
340;00:29:42,945;00:29:45,880;a formal apology
341;00:29:45,915;00:29:47,916;for your violation
341;00:29:45,915;00:29:47,916;of your sacred oath
342;00:29:47,950;00:29:49,284;to marry one
342;00:29:47,950;00:29:49,284;of his daughters.
343;00:29:49,318;00:29:52,420;Of course. He deserves as much.
343;00:29:49,318;00:29:52,420;I was in the wrong.
344;00:29:52,455;00:29:54,889;As restitution
344;00:29:52,455;00:29:54,889;for this betrayal,
345;00:29:54,924;00:29:58,026;he demands Harrenhal
345;00:29:54,924;00:29:58,026;and all its attendant lands.
346;00:29:58,060;00:30:01,395;I don't think that's--
346;00:29:58,060;00:30:01,395;We are fighting for the North.
347;00:30:02,431;00:30:04,398;Harrenhal is not
347;00:30:02,431;00:30:04,398;in the North.
348;00:30:04,432;00:30:08,102;It is his
348;00:30:04,432;00:30:08,102;once the war is over
349;00:30:08,136;00:30:10,771;and we have no further
349;00:30:08,136;00:30:10,771;strategic need for it.
350;00:30:11,706;00:30:14,607;And there's
350;00:30:11,706;00:30:14,607;something else.
351;00:30:14,642;00:30:17,443;We will do whatever we can
351;00:30:14,642;00:30:17,443;to give Lord Frey what he needs.
352;00:30:17,478;00:30:21,047;Not what, whom.
353;00:30:22,617;00:30:24,451;What?
354;00:30:28,356;00:30:31,425;No.
355;00:30:31,459;00:30:33,694;Our father requires
355;00:30:31,459;00:30:33,694;Lord Edmure to wed
356;00:30:33,728;00:30:35,663;one of his daughters--
356;00:30:33,728;00:30:35,663;Roslin.
357;00:30:35,697;00:30:37,532;How old is she?
358;00:30:37,566;00:30:38,800;19.
359;00:30:38,834;00:30:40,401;Could I see her first?
360;00:30:40,435;00:30:41,569;You want to count
360;00:30:40,435;00:30:41,569;her teeth?
361;00:30:41,603;00:30:44,338;We depart for the Twins
361;00:30:41,603;00:30:44,338;in the morning.
362;00:30:44,373;00:30:46,407;We need an answer
362;00:30:44,373;00:30:46,407;before we leave
363;00:30:46,441;00:30:48,141;and a wedding not more
363;00:30:46,441;00:30:48,141;than a fortnight thereafter
364;00:30:48,176;00:30:50,210;or this alliance
364;00:30:48,176;00:30:50,210;is at an end.
365;00:30:50,244;00:30:52,813;Your father does realize
365;00:30:50,244;00:30:52,813;we're in the middle of a war?
366;00:30:52,847;00:30:55,515;Father is old.
367;00:30:55,549;00:30:57,550;It will put
367;00:30:55,549;00:30:57,550;his heart at peace
368;00:30:57,584;00:31:00,452;if he could see her wed
368;00:30:57,584;00:31:00,452;to a good husband.
369;00:31:00,487;00:31:03,322;And his recent experience
369;00:31:00,487;00:31:03,322;has made him wary
370;00:31:03,390;00:31:05,258;of long engagements.
371;00:31:05,292;00:31:07,093;He has every right to be.
372;00:31:07,127;00:31:10,429;Please excuse us
372;00:31:07,127;00:31:10,429;while we discuss it.
373;00:31:26,981;00:31:30,550;Why should I let that old
373;00:31:26,981;00:31:30,550;ferret choose my bride for me?
374;00:31:30,585;00:31:33,654;At the very least, I should be
374;00:31:30,585;00:31:33,654;offered the same choice you were.
375;00:31:33,688;00:31:35,122;I'm his liege lord.
376;00:31:35,156;00:31:37,357;He's a proud man
376;00:31:35,156;00:31:37,357;and we've wounded him.
377;00:31:37,392;00:31:39,359;I didn't wound him.
378;00:31:39,394;00:31:41,028;My answer is no.
379;00:31:45,300;00:31:47,000;Listen to me
380;00:31:47,035;00:31:50,004;and listen very carefully.
380;00:31:47,035;00:31:50,004;You--
381;00:31:50,038;00:31:52,740;The laws of gods and men
381;00:31:50,038;00:31:52,740;are very clear.
382;00:31:52,774;00:31:55,242;No man can compel
382;00:31:52,774;00:31:55,242;another man to marry.
383;00:31:55,277;00:31:57,845;The laws of my fist
383;00:31:55,277;00:31:57,845;are about to compel your teeth.
384;00:31:57,879;00:32:01,081;It's all right.
384;00:31:57,879;00:32:01,081;You heard him.
385;00:32:01,149;00:32:04,318;If you refuse, our alliance with
385;00:32:01,149;00:32:04,318;the Freys is dead.
386;00:32:04,352;00:32:07,754;He's wanted me for one
386;00:32:04,352;00:32:07,754;of his daughters since I was 12.
387;00:32:07,789;00:32:10,557;He's not gonna stop
387;00:32:07,789;00:32:10,557;wanting it now.
388;00:32:10,592;00:32:12,960;When I say no,
388;00:32:10,592;00:32:12,960;he will come back
389;00:32:12,994;00:32:14,995;and offer me a daughter
389;00:32:12,994;00:32:14,995;of my choosing.
390;00:32:15,030;00:32:16,864;You're willing to risk
390;00:32:15,030;00:32:16,864;our freedom
391;00:32:16,898;00:32:19,333;and our lives for a chance
391;00:32:16,898;00:32:19,333;at a prettier wife?
392;00:32:19,367;00:32:21,702;I have a war to fight.
393;00:32:21,736;00:32:23,737;We can't win it
393;00:32:21,736;00:32:23,737;without them.
394;00:32:23,772;00:32:25,606;I have no time to haggle.
395;00:32:25,640;00:32:27,775;You said you wanted to make
395;00:32:25,640;00:32:27,775;amends for the Stone Mill.
396;00:32:27,809;00:32:31,713;You recall that
396;00:32:27,809;00:32:31,713;heroic engagement?
397;00:32:35,118;00:32:38,654;I had something
397;00:32:35,118;00:32:38,654;less permanent in mind.
398;00:32:38,688;00:32:41,123;I've won every battle,
399;00:32:41,157;00:32:42,992;but I'm losing this war.
400;00:32:44,795;00:32:47,997;If we don't do this
400;00:32:44,795;00:32:47,997;and do it now,
401;00:32:48,031;00:32:50,099;we're lost.
402;00:32:55,505;00:32:57,373;I'll marry her.
403;00:32:57,407;00:33:00,309;You're paying
403;00:32:57,407;00:33:00,309;for my sins, Uncle.
404;00:33:00,343;00:33:03,179;It's not fair or right.
405;00:33:03,213;00:33:05,014;I'll remember it.
406;00:33:10,987;00:33:12,655;I see my men have
406;00:33:10,987;00:33:12,655;finally found you
407;00:33:12,689;00:33:14,757;something appropriate
407;00:33:12,689;00:33:14,757;to wear.
408;00:33:14,791;00:33:18,694;Yes. Most kind of them.
409;00:33:18,728;00:33:20,795;You're a Stark
409;00:33:18,728;00:33:20,795;bannerman, Lord Bolton.
410;00:33:20,830;00:33:23,465;I am acting on
410;00:33:20,830;00:33:23,465;Lady Stark's orders
411;00:33:23,499;00:33:25,500;to return Jaime Lannister
411;00:33:23,499;00:33:25,500;to King's Landing.
412;00:33:25,534;00:33:29,136;When King Robb left Harrenhal,
412;00:33:25,534;00:33:29,136;his mother was his prisoner.
413;00:33:29,171;00:33:30,771;If she wasn't his mother,
414;00:33:30,805;00:33:32,906;he'd have hanged her
414;00:33:30,805;00:33:32,906;for treason.
415;00:33:40,114;00:33:42,381;I should send you
415;00:33:40,114;00:33:42,381;back to Robb Stark.
416;00:33:42,415;00:33:44,650;You should.
417;00:33:44,685;00:33:47,119;But instead,
417;00:33:44,685;00:33:47,119;you're sitting here
418;00:33:47,154;00:33:49,789;watching me fail at dinner.
419;00:33:49,823;00:33:51,991;Why might that be?
420;00:33:52,025;00:33:53,893;Wars cost money.
421;00:33:53,927;00:33:55,895;Many people would pay
421;00:33:53,927;00:33:55,895;a great deal for you.
422;00:33:55,929;00:33:58,598;We both know
422;00:33:55,929;00:33:58,598;who would pay the most.
423;00:34:00,134;00:34:01,701;Or make you pay the most
424;00:34:01,735;00:34:03,402;if he found out
424;00:34:01,735;00:34:03,402;you had captured me
425;00:34:03,437;00:34:05,671;and sent me back up north
425;00:34:03,437;00:34:05,671;for a summary execution.
426;00:34:05,706;00:34:08,074;You're right.
427;00:34:08,108;00:34:11,911;Perhaps the safest thing to do is to
427;00:34:08,108;00:34:11,911;kill you both and burn your bodies.
428;00:34:11,946;00:34:13,880;It would be,
429;00:34:13,915;00:34:17,217;if you honestly believed my father
429;00:34:13,915;00:34:17,217;would never find out about it.
430;00:34:17,251;00:34:19,919;King Robb is keeping
430;00:34:17,251;00:34:19,919;your father quite busy.
431;00:34:19,954;00:34:22,288;He doesn't have time
431;00:34:19,954;00:34:22,288;for anything else.
432;00:34:22,323;00:34:24,491;He'll make time for you.
433;00:34:27,829;00:34:29,329;As soon as you're
433;00:34:27,829;00:34:29,329;well enough to travel,
434;00:34:29,364;00:34:32,166;I will allow you
434;00:34:29,364;00:34:32,166;to go to King's Landing
435;00:34:32,200;00:34:35,703;as restitution for the mistakes
435;00:34:32,200;00:34:35,703;my soldiers made.
436;00:34:35,738;00:34:39,106;And you will swear to tell
436;00:34:35,738;00:34:39,106;your father the truth,
437;00:34:39,141;00:34:41,676;that I had nothing
437;00:34:39,141;00:34:41,676;to do with your maiming.
438;00:34:48,450;00:34:51,118;Shall we drink on it?
438;00:34:48,450;00:34:51,118;I don't partake.
439;00:34:52,955;00:34:56,658;You do understand how suspicious
439;00:34:52,955;00:34:56,658;that is to ordinary people?
440;00:34:58,127;00:35:00,128;Very well.
441;00:35:00,162;00:35:02,197;My lady,
442;00:35:02,231;00:35:05,300;may our journey continue
442;00:35:02,231;00:35:05,300;without further incident.
443;00:35:05,334;00:35:07,068;Oh, she won't be
443;00:35:05,334;00:35:07,068;going with you.
444;00:35:07,102;00:35:09,804;I am charged with
444;00:35:07,102;00:35:09,804;bringing Ser Jaime to--
445;00:35:09,838;00:35:12,606;You are charged
445;00:35:09,838;00:35:12,606;with abetting treason.
446;00:35:12,641;00:35:14,775;I'm afraid I must insist.
447;00:35:14,809;00:35:17,477;You're in no place
447;00:35:14,809;00:35:17,477;to insist on anything.
448;00:35:17,511;00:35:19,646;I would have hoped
448;00:35:17,511;00:35:19,646;you'd learned your lesson
449;00:35:19,680;00:35:23,516;about overplaying
449;00:35:19,680;00:35:23,516;your position.
450;00:35:27,488;00:35:29,656;- Impossible.
450;00:35:27,488;00:35:29,656;Why?
451;00:35:29,690;00:35:32,025;My grandson is the pride
451;00:35:29,690;00:35:32,025;of Highgarden.
452;00:35:32,059;00:35:35,195;The most desirable bachelor
452;00:35:32,059;00:35:35,195;in all seven kingdoms.
453;00:35:35,229;00:35:37,831;Your daughter--
453;00:35:35,229;00:35:37,831;Is rich,
454;00:35:37,865;00:35:41,601;the most beautiful woman
454;00:35:37,865;00:35:41,601;in all seven kingdoms...
455;00:35:42,837;00:35:44,637;and the mother
455;00:35:42,837;00:35:44,637;of the king.
456;00:35:44,672;00:35:46,072;Old.
457;00:35:46,941;00:35:47,941;Old?
458;00:35:47,975;00:35:51,044;Old.
459;00:35:51,078;00:35:53,546;I'm something of an expert
459;00:35:51,078;00:35:53,546;on the subject.
460;00:35:53,580;00:35:56,182;Her change will be
460;00:35:53,580;00:35:56,182;upon her before long.
461;00:35:56,217;00:35:59,719;I'll spare you the details
461;00:35:56,217;00:35:59,719;of what will happen then.
462;00:35:59,753;00:36:02,455;You men may have a stomach
462;00:35:59,753;00:36:02,455;for bloodshed and slaughter,
463;00:36:02,489;00:36:04,891;but this is another
463;00:36:02,489;00:36:04,891;matter entirely.
464;00:36:04,925;00:36:08,561;The years punish us as well,
464;00:36:04,925;00:36:08,561;I promise you that.
465;00:36:10,798;00:36:14,968;My stomach remains
465;00:36:10,798;00:36:14,968;quite strong, however.
466;00:36:15,002;00:36:16,837;The only thing
466;00:36:15,002;00:36:16,837;that might turn it
467;00:36:16,871;00:36:20,574;are details of your grandson's
467;00:36:16,871;00:36:20,574;nocturnal activities.
468;00:36:21,876;00:36:23,810;- Do you deny them?
468;00:36:21,876;00:36:23,810;Oh, not at all.
469;00:36:23,844;00:36:25,879;A sword swallower
469;00:36:23,844;00:36:25,879;through and through.
470;00:36:25,913;00:36:27,680;And a boy
470;00:36:25,913;00:36:27,680;with his affliction
471;00:36:27,715;00:36:29,716;should be grateful
471;00:36:27,715;00:36:29,716;for the opportunity
472;00:36:29,750;00:36:32,785;to marry the most beautiful
472;00:36:29,750;00:36:32,785;woman in the kingdoms
473;00:36:32,853;00:36:34,686;and remove the stain
473;00:36:32,853;00:36:34,686;from his name.
474;00:36:34,721;00:36:37,956;Did you grow up
474;00:36:34,721;00:36:37,956;with boy cousins, Lord Tywin?
475;00:36:37,990;00:36:39,991;Sons of your father's
475;00:36:37,990;00:36:39,991;bannermen,
476;00:36:40,026;00:36:41,860;squires, stable boys?
477;00:36:41,894;00:36:44,195;Of course.
478;00:36:44,229;00:36:47,398;And you never...
479;00:36:47,433;00:36:49,467;No.
480;00:36:49,501;00:36:51,502;Not once?
481;00:36:51,537;00:36:53,104;Not in any way?
482;00:36:53,138;00:36:55,006;Never.
483;00:36:55,040;00:36:57,976;I congratulate you
483;00:36:55,040;00:36:57,976;upon your restraint.
484;00:36:58,043;00:37:00,278;But it's a natural thing,
484;00:36:58,043;00:37:00,278;two boys having a go
485;00:37:00,312;00:37:01,946;at each other
485;00:37:00,312;00:37:01,946;beneath the sheets.
486;00:37:01,980;00:37:04,549;Perhaps Highgarden
486;00:37:01,980;00:37:04,549;has a high tolerance
487;00:37:04,583;00:37:06,484;for unnatural behavior.
488;00:37:06,518;00:37:07,952;I wouldn't say that.
489;00:37:07,987;00:37:10,255;True, we don't tie
489;00:37:07,987;00:37:10,255;ourselves in knots
490;00:37:10,289;00:37:13,458;over a discreet
490;00:37:10,289;00:37:13,458;bit of buggery, but...
491;00:37:15,127;00:37:17,229;brothers and sisters--
492;00:37:18,598;00:37:20,799;where I come from,
492;00:37:18,598;00:37:20,799;that stain
493;00:37:20,834;00:37:23,302;would be very difficult
493;00:37:20,834;00:37:23,302;to wash out.
494;00:37:23,336;00:37:25,938;I will not breathe
494;00:37:23,336;00:37:25,938;further life
495;00:37:25,973;00:37:28,374;into a malicious lie
495;00:37:25,973;00:37:28,374;by discussing it.
496;00:37:30,244;00:37:32,011;Lie or not,
497;00:37:32,045;00:37:35,181;you must admit many people
497;00:37:32,045;00:37:35,181;find it quite convincing.
498;00:37:35,216;00:37:37,751;Convincing enough
498;00:37:35,216;00:37:37,751;to put swords in their hands
499;00:37:37,785;00:37:39,819;and send them off
499;00:37:37,785;00:37:39,819;to kill Lannisters
500;00:37:39,854;00:37:42,889;and Tyrells thanks to
500;00:37:39,854;00:37:42,889;our new affiliation.
501;00:37:42,923;00:37:44,991;I don't care
501;00:37:42,923;00:37:44,991;what people believe.
502;00:37:45,025;00:37:47,860;And neither do you.
503;00:37:47,895;00:37:51,464;As an authority on myself,
503;00:37:47,895;00:37:51,464;I must disagree.
504;00:37:51,532;00:37:55,669;Now, if the rumors about
504;00:37:51,532;00:37:55,669;my children were true,
505;00:37:55,703;00:37:58,605;then Joffrey
505;00:37:55,703;00:37:58,605;is no king at all
506;00:37:58,639;00:38:02,809;and House Tyrell is throwing its
506;00:37:58,639;00:38:02,809;prized flower into the dirt.
507;00:38:02,844;00:38:06,547;And if Cersei is too old
507;00:38:02,844;00:38:06,547;to give Loras children,
508;00:38:06,581;00:38:10,751;we're throwing another
508;00:38:06,581;00:38:10,751;prized flower into the dirt.
509;00:38:10,786;00:38:14,322;It is a chance
509;00:38:10,786;00:38:14,322;we simply cannot take.
510;00:38:14,356;00:38:16,891;The uncertainty
510;00:38:14,356;00:38:16,891;makes you uncomfortable.
511;00:38:18,294;00:38:20,128;All right.
512;00:38:20,162;00:38:22,696;I'll remove it for you.
513;00:38:22,731;00:38:25,532;If you refuse to marry
513;00:38:22,731;00:38:25,532;Loras to Cersei,
514;00:38:25,567;00:38:28,435;I will name him
514;00:38:25,567;00:38:28,435;to the Kingsguard.
515;00:38:28,469;00:38:31,904;I'm sure you're familiar
515;00:38:28,469;00:38:31,904;with the Kingsguard vows.
516;00:38:31,939;00:38:33,939;He will never marry.
517;00:38:33,974;00:38:35,774;He will never have children.
517;00:38:33,974;00:38:35,774;Oh...
518;00:38:35,809;00:38:37,709;The Tyrell name
518;00:38:35,809;00:38:37,709;will fade.
519;00:38:37,744;00:38:40,412;And Highgarden will go
519;00:38:37,744;00:38:40,412;to the children
520;00:38:40,446;00:38:41,947;of Joffrey
520;00:38:40,446;00:38:41,947;and Margaery.
521;00:38:41,981;00:38:44,450;You would have
521;00:38:41,981;00:38:44,450;your grandson protected
522;00:38:44,484;00:38:46,319;by someone
522;00:38:44,484;00:38:46,319;who disgusts you?
523;00:38:46,353;00:38:49,956;I would have my grandson
523;00:38:46,353;00:38:49,956;protected by a skilled warrior
524;00:38:49,990;00:38:53,327;who takes his vows
524;00:38:49,990;00:38:53,327;seriously.
525;00:38:53,361;00:38:56,196;So, shall I draw up
525;00:38:53,361;00:38:56,196;the order?
526;00:38:57,732;00:39:00,134;Or do you consent
526;00:38:57,732;00:39:00,134;to this marriage?
527;00:39:04,805;00:39:06,839;It's a rare enough thing--
528;00:39:06,907;00:39:10,777;a man who lives up
528;00:39:06,907;00:39:10,777;to his reputation.
529;00:40:03,628;00:40:04,962;No!
530;00:40:24,550;00:40:26,351;We've gotta cut them loose!
531;00:40:26,385;00:40:28,653;No!
532;00:41:14,134;00:41:15,901;Take my hand!
533;00:41:51,773;00:41:53,841;That's a wonderful pin.
534;00:41:53,875;00:41:57,378;Oh, it's more
534;00:41:53,875;00:41:57,378;of a brooch, really.
535;00:42:00,649;00:42:04,085;Though I suppose a brooch
535;00:42:00,649;00:42:04,085;is a sort of pin, so...
536;00:42:09,258;00:42:12,793;I'm very happy about...
537;00:42:12,827;00:42:14,628;Uh, yes.
538;00:42:14,663;00:42:16,830;I-I am as well.
539;00:42:19,134;00:42:21,168;I feel like
539;00:42:19,134;00:42:21,168;I'm in a dream.
540;00:42:21,203;00:42:24,973;Yes, me, too.
540;00:42:21,203;00:42:24,973;Definitely.
541;00:42:25,007;00:42:27,542;I've dreamed of a large wedding
541;00:42:25,007;00:42:27,542;since I was quite young.
542;00:42:27,577;00:42:28,777;The guests,
543;00:42:28,811;00:42:31,980;the food,
543;00:42:28,811;00:42:31,980;the tournaments.
544;00:42:35,052;00:42:37,587;And the bride,
544;00:42:35,052;00:42:37,587;of course.
545;00:42:41,392;00:42:44,027;The most beautiful bride
545;00:42:41,392;00:42:44,027;in the world
546;00:42:44,061;00:42:45,661;in a beautiful
546;00:42:44,061;00:42:45,661;gown of gold
547;00:42:45,696;00:42:48,264;and green brocade
547;00:42:45,696;00:42:48,264;with fringed sleeves.
548;00:42:50,701;00:42:52,936;Have you ever been
548;00:42:50,701;00:42:52,936;to Highgarden, my lady?
549;00:42:54,071;00:42:55,705;No. I had never
549;00:42:54,071;00:42:55,705;left Winterfell
550;00:42:55,739;00:42:58,742;before I came
550;00:42:55,739;00:42:58,742;to King's Landing.
551;00:42:58,776;00:43:00,343;But it sounds wonderful.
552;00:43:00,378;00:43:02,979;I can't wait to see it.
553;00:43:03,014;00:43:05,115;And to leave this place.
554;00:43:06,217;00:43:07,985;It's terrible,
554;00:43:06,217;00:43:07,985;isn't it?
555;00:43:10,488;00:43:12,990;The most terrible
555;00:43:10,488;00:43:12,990;place there is.
556;00:43:22,501;00:43:25,736;I don't suppose
556;00:43:22,501;00:43:25,736;there's anything we can do about this.
557;00:43:25,770;00:43:28,038;We can have them
557;00:43:25,770;00:43:28,038;both killed.
558;00:43:29,841;00:43:31,808;It's hard to say
558;00:43:29,841;00:43:31,808;which of the four of us
559;00:43:31,843;00:43:34,845;is getting the worst
559;00:43:31,843;00:43:34,845;of this arrangement.
560;00:43:34,879;00:43:36,813;Probably Sansa.
561;00:43:36,848;00:43:38,682;Though Loras
561;00:43:36,848;00:43:38,682;will certainly come to know
562;00:43:38,716;00:43:41,485;a deep and singular misery.
563;00:43:41,519;00:43:44,255;Father doesn't
563;00:43:41,519;00:43:44,255;discriminate.
564;00:43:44,289;00:43:47,125;We're all being shipped
564;00:43:44,289;00:43:47,125;off to hell together.
565;00:43:47,159;00:43:49,260;On a boat you built.
566;00:43:49,295;00:43:52,331;The Tyrells were plotting
566;00:43:49,295;00:43:52,331;to undermine our family.
567;00:43:52,365;00:43:54,901;I did what I did
567;00:43:52,365;00:43:54,901;to protect our family.
568;00:43:54,935;00:43:57,036;I'm your family.
569;00:43:57,971;00:44:00,006;A member of your family
570;00:44:00,040;00:44:03,076;who has actively contributed
570;00:44:00,040;00:44:03,076;to that family's survival.
571;00:44:04,144;00:44:05,911;Whether or not
571;00:44:04,144;00:44:05,911;you or Father
572;00:44:05,946;00:44:07,947;or anyone else
572;00:44:05,946;00:44:07,947;wants to admit it.
573;00:44:07,982;00:44:10,283;I do admit it.
574;00:44:10,317;00:44:12,952;If it weren't for your trick
574;00:44:10,317;00:44:12,952;with the wildfire,
575;00:44:12,987;00:44:16,289;Stannis would have sacked the
575;00:44:12,987;00:44:16,289;city before Father got here.
576;00:44:16,323;00:44:19,392;Our heads would still be
576;00:44:16,323;00:44:19,392;rotting on the city gate.
577;00:44:19,427;00:44:23,763;Trying to have me killed is an
577;00:44:19,427;00:44:23,763;odd way of saying thank you.
578;00:44:25,900;00:44:27,968;There are two people
578;00:44:25,900;00:44:27,968;in King's Landing
579;00:44:28,002;00:44:30,169;who can give an order
579;00:44:28,002;00:44:30,169;to a Kingsguard.
580;00:44:30,204;00:44:33,173;Did you or did you not
580;00:44:30,204;00:44:33,173;order Ser Mandon
581;00:44:33,207;00:44:36,109;to kill me during the Battle
581;00:44:33,207;00:44:36,109;of the Blackwater?
582;00:44:45,685;00:44:48,120;The impulse I understand.
583;00:44:49,323;00:44:52,258;He hates me
583;00:44:49,323;00:44:52,258;because I'm the only one
584;00:44:52,292;00:44:55,161;who tells him
584;00:44:52,292;00:44:55,161;what he really is.
585;00:44:58,031;00:45:02,468;So, fair enough.
585;00:44:58,031;00:45:02,468;He wants me dead.
586;00:45:02,503;00:45:04,504;But his stupidity?
587;00:45:04,538;00:45:08,541;He could have had me poisoned
587;00:45:04,538;00:45:08,541;and no one would have known.
588;00:45:08,576;00:45:12,044;But the king
588;00:45:08,576;00:45:12,044;orders a Kingsguard
589;00:45:12,079;00:45:14,247;to murder
589;00:45:12,079;00:45:14,247;the Hand of the King
590;00:45:14,281;00:45:16,182;in full view
590;00:45:14,281;00:45:16,182;of his own army.
591;00:45:16,216;00:45:17,750;The boy's an idiot.
592;00:45:17,785;00:45:19,185;What do you
592;00:45:17,785;00:45:19,185;want me to say?
593;00:45:19,219;00:45:22,221;I want you to tell me if my life
593;00:45:19,219;00:45:22,221;is still in danger.
594;00:45:22,256;00:45:23,990;Probably.
595;00:45:24,024;00:45:25,725;But not from Joffrey.
596;00:45:25,760;00:45:27,927;He won't do anything
596;00:45:25,760;00:45:27,927;now Father's here.
597;00:45:29,597;00:45:32,199;Seven kingdoms
597;00:45:29,597;00:45:32,199;united in fear
598;00:45:32,233;00:45:34,367;of Tywin Lannister.
599;00:45:34,402;00:45:36,770;Not the Tyrells.
600;00:45:36,804;00:45:38,839;Soon they won't need
600;00:45:36,804;00:45:38,839;to be afraid of him.
601;00:45:38,873;00:45:40,307;Joffrey will belong
601;00:45:38,873;00:45:40,307;to Margaery,
602;00:45:40,341;00:45:42,242;the little
602;00:45:40,341;00:45:42,242;doe-eyed whore.
603;00:45:42,276;00:45:45,278;And so will his children
603;00:45:42,276;00:45:45,278;and their children.
604;00:45:45,313;00:45:47,548;History will be taken
604;00:45:45,313;00:45:47,548;from our hands.
605;00:45:49,551;00:45:52,119;You may escape,
605;00:45:49,551;00:45:52,119;at least.
606;00:45:52,153;00:45:53,787;Once Jaime gets back,
607;00:45:53,822;00:45:56,323;Ser Loras may come down
607;00:45:53,822;00:45:56,323;with a terrible case
608;00:45:56,358;00:45:59,560;of sword through bowels.
609;00:45:59,594;00:46:01,562;When Jaime gets back, yes.
610;00:46:01,596;00:46:03,264;But when do we think
610;00:46:01,596;00:46:03,264;that's going to be?
611;00:46:03,298;00:46:05,132;He's out there somewhere.
612;00:46:06,935;00:46:10,805;Jaime or not,
612;00:46:06,935;00:46:10,805;I'm truly fucked.
613;00:46:13,876;00:46:16,011;Who's going to tell her?
614;00:46:17,413;00:46:19,747;Do you think
614;00:46:17,413;00:46:19,747;people will like it?
615;00:46:19,782;00:46:22,283;I don't think they
615;00:46:19,782;00:46:22,283;will even notice it.
616;00:46:22,317;00:46:24,786;You're right.
616;00:46:22,317;00:46:24,786;It's not my wedding.
617;00:46:26,288;00:46:27,756;Anyway, from what
617;00:46:26,288;00:46:27,756;I can tell,
618;00:46:27,790;00:46:29,958;the dressmakers in Highgarden
618;00:46:27,790;00:46:29,958;will be far superior
619;00:46:29,992;00:46:31,559;to the ones
619;00:46:29,992;00:46:31,559;in King's Landing.
620;00:46:31,594;00:46:34,929;They'd never make me anything
620;00:46:31,594;00:46:34,929;as dull as this for my wedding.
621;00:46:36,132;00:46:38,833;Loras likes green
621;00:46:36,132;00:46:38,833;and gold brocade.
622;00:46:38,868;00:46:40,735;I'm sure he does.
623;00:46:42,204;00:46:44,138;Will they let me
623;00:46:42,204;00:46:44,138;invite my family?
624;00:46:44,173;00:46:46,574;They haven't asked
624;00:46:44,173;00:46:46,574;my opinion.
625;00:46:46,608;00:46:48,977;But do you think
625;00:46:46,608;00:46:48,977;they will?
626;00:46:49,011;00:46:50,612;No.
627;00:46:57,553;00:46:59,253;Lady Sansa,
627;00:46:57,553;00:46:59,253;Lord Tyrion to see you.
628;00:46:59,288;00:47:02,123;Should I--
628;00:46:59,288;00:47:02,123;I beg your pardon, my lady.
629;00:47:02,158;00:47:04,526;Good afternoon,
629;00:47:02,158;00:47:04,526;Lord Tyrion.
630;00:47:04,561;00:47:07,096;I was just trying on a gown
630;00:47:04,561;00:47:07,096;for King Joffrey's wedding.
631;00:47:08,565;00:47:13,035;Yes, it should be
631;00:47:08,565;00:47:13,035;quite a wedding.
632;00:47:13,069;00:47:15,471;I need to speak
632;00:47:13,069;00:47:15,471;with you, Lady Sansa.
633;00:47:15,506;00:47:17,006;Of course.
634;00:47:17,040;00:47:19,709;Alone, if I may.
635;00:47:19,744;00:47:21,444;Why do you need
635;00:47:19,744;00:47:21,444;to speak to her alone?
636;00:47:21,479;00:47:23,280;Shae.
637;00:47:23,314;00:47:25,081;Please excuse her,
637;00:47:23,314;00:47:25,081;Lord Tyrion.
638;00:47:25,116;00:47:26,617;She's not from here.
639;00:47:26,651;00:47:27,851;But I trust her,
640;00:47:27,885;00:47:30,154;even though
640;00:47:27,885;00:47:30,154;she tells me not to.
641;00:47:31,823;00:47:35,660;Sometimes we think
641;00:47:31,823;00:47:35,660;we want to hear something
642;00:47:35,694;00:47:38,763;and it's only afterwards
642;00:47:35,694;00:47:38,763;when it's too late
643;00:47:38,797;00:47:41,565;that we realize
643;00:47:38,797;00:47:41,565;we wished we'd heard it
644;00:47:41,600;00:47:43,734;under entirely
644;00:47:41,600;00:47:43,734;different circumstances.
645;00:47:43,769;00:47:45,603;It's all right, really.
646;00:47:49,140;00:47:51,375;How to begin?
647;00:47:53,945;00:47:56,513;It's-- this--
648;00:47:56,548;00:48:00,184;this-- this is awkward.
649;00:48:02,220;00:48:04,254;1,000 blades
650;00:48:04,289;00:48:07,357;taken from the hands
650;00:48:04,289;00:48:07,357;of Aegon's fallen enemies,
651;00:48:07,392;00:48:10,794;forged in the fiery breath
651;00:48:07,392;00:48:10,794;of Balerion the Dread.
652;00:48:10,828;00:48:13,564;There aren't
652;00:48:10,828;00:48:13,564;1,000 blades.
653;00:48:13,598;00:48:16,166;There aren't even 200.
654;00:48:16,201;00:48:17,702;I've counted.
655;00:48:17,736;00:48:20,371;Ha, I'm sure you have.
656;00:48:20,405;00:48:23,141;Ugly old thing.
657;00:48:23,175;00:48:26,277;Yet it has
657;00:48:23,175;00:48:26,277;a certain appeal.
658;00:48:26,312;00:48:28,747;The Lysa Arryn
658;00:48:26,312;00:48:28,747;of chairs.
659;00:48:28,781;00:48:31,549;Shame you had to settle
659;00:48:28,781;00:48:31,549;for your second choice.
660;00:48:31,584;00:48:33,852;Early days, my friend.
661;00:48:33,886;00:48:36,821;It is flattering,
661;00:48:33,886;00:48:36,821;really...
662;00:48:38,124;00:48:40,792;you feeling such dread
663;00:48:40,826;00:48:43,294;at the prospect of me
663;00:48:40,826;00:48:43,294;getting what I want.
664;00:48:43,329;00:48:46,131;Thwarting you has never
664;00:48:43,329;00:48:46,131;been my primary ambition,
665;00:48:46,165;00:48:47,999;I promise you.
666;00:48:48,034;00:48:51,436;Although who doesn't like to see
666;00:48:48,034;00:48:51,436;their friends fail now and then?
667;00:48:51,470;00:48:52,737;You're so right.
668;00:48:52,772;00:48:54,573;For instance,
669;00:48:54,607;00:48:56,308;when I thwarted
669;00:48:54,607;00:48:56,308;your plan
670;00:48:56,342;00:48:58,410;to give Sansa Stark
670;00:48:56,342;00:48:58,410;to the Tyrells.
671;00:48:58,444;00:49:00,545;If I'm going
671;00:48:58,444;00:49:00,545;to be honest,
672;00:49:00,579;00:49:02,447;I did feel
672;00:49:00,579;00:49:02,447;an unmistakable sense
673;00:49:02,481;00:49:05,950;of enjoyment there.
674;00:49:05,985;00:49:08,586;But your confidant,
675;00:49:08,621;00:49:12,090;the one who fed you information
675;00:49:08,621;00:49:12,090;about my plans,
676;00:49:12,124;00:49:14,859;the one you swore
676;00:49:12,124;00:49:14,859;to protect...
677;00:49:16,195;00:49:18,796;you didn't bring her
677;00:49:16,195;00:49:18,796;any enjoyment.
678;00:49:19,965;00:49:23,434;And she didn't bring me
678;00:49:19,965;00:49:23,434;any enjoyment.
679;00:49:23,469;00:49:26,671;She was a bad
679;00:49:23,469;00:49:26,671;investment on my part.
680;00:49:28,373;00:49:31,509;Luckily, I have a friend
681;00:49:31,543;00:49:33,911;who wanted to try
681;00:49:31,543;00:49:33,911;something new.
682;00:49:33,945;00:49:37,448;Something daring.
683;00:49:37,483;00:49:41,285;And he was so grateful
683;00:49:37,483;00:49:41,285;to me for providing
684;00:49:41,320;00:49:44,588;this fresh experience.
685;00:49:48,659;00:49:51,461;I did what I did
685;00:49:48,659;00:49:51,461;for the good of the realm.
686;00:49:51,495;00:49:54,130;The realm?
687;00:49:54,164;00:49:56,565;Do you know
687;00:49:54,164;00:49:56,565;what the realm is?
688;00:49:58,335;00:50:01,537;It's the thousand blades
688;00:49:58,335;00:50:01,537;of Aegon's enemies.
689;00:50:01,571;00:50:06,509;A story we agree to tell
689;00:50:01,571;00:50:06,509;each other over and over
690;00:50:06,543;00:50:09,011;till we forget
690;00:50:06,543;00:50:09,011;that it's a lie.
691;00:50:09,045;00:50:13,616;But what do we have left
691;00:50:09,045;00:50:13,616;once we abandon the lie?
692;00:50:13,650;00:50:15,585;Chaos.
693;00:50:15,619;00:50:18,321;A gaping pit waiting
693;00:50:15,619;00:50:18,321;to swallow us all.
694;00:50:18,355;00:50:21,891;Chaos isn't a pit.
695;00:50:21,926;00:50:24,293;Chaos is a ladder.
696;00:50:26,463;00:50:28,964;Many who try
696;00:50:26,463;00:50:28,964;to climb it fail
697;00:50:28,999;00:50:31,433;and never get
697;00:50:28,999;00:50:31,433;to try again.
698;00:50:32,535;00:50:35,103;The fall breaks them.
699;00:50:43,546;00:50:47,248;And some are given
699;00:50:43,546;00:50:47,248;a chance to climb,
700;00:50:47,283;00:50:49,750;but they refuse.
701;00:50:49,785;00:50:53,120;They cling to the realm
702;00:50:53,154;00:50:55,155;or the gods
703;00:50:55,189;00:50:57,624;or love.
704;00:50:57,658;00:50:59,893;Illusions.
705;00:51:01,095;00:51:03,863;Only the ladder is real.
706;00:51:03,898;00:51:07,200;The climb is all there is.
