1;00:00:06,780;00:00:08,238;What if the Seven Kingdoms
2;00:00:08,571;00:00:11,279;were ruled by a just woman
2;00:00:08,571;00:00:11,279;and an honorable man?
3;00:00:11,947;00:00:13,738;You're Aegon Targaryen...
4;00:00:14,780;00:00:16,404;true heir to the Iron Throne.
5;00:00:17,696;00:00:18,905;You've always been.
6;00:00:20,738;00:00:23,030;She doesn't need to be my friend.
7;00:00:24,363;00:00:25,488;But I am her queen.
8;00:00:26,030;00:00:27,780;We must fight together now...
9;00:00:29,655;00:00:30,571;or die.
10;00:00:31,155;00:00:33,571;The things I do for love.

12;00:02:34,279;00:02:38,155;When I was a child, my brother
12;00:02:34,279;00:02:38,155;would tell me a bedtime story...
13;00:02:39,571;00:02:42,363;about the man who murdered our father.
14;00:02:43,947;00:02:47,279;Who stabbed him in the back
14;00:02:43,947;00:02:47,279;and cut his throat.
15;00:02:47,363;00:02:50,279;Who sat down on the Iron Throne
15;00:02:47,363;00:02:50,279;and watched
16;00:02:50,363;00:02:53,030;as his blood poured onto the floor.
17;00:02:54,488;00:02:56,988;He told me other stories as well.
18;00:02:57,072;00:03:00,363;About all the things
18;00:02:57,072;00:03:00,363;we would do to that man...
19;00:03:01,738;00:03:03,571;once we took back the Seven Kingdoms
20;00:03:03,655;00:03:05,113;and had him in our grasp.
21;00:03:07,113;00:03:10,488;Your sister pledged
21;00:03:07,113;00:03:10,488;to send her army north.
22;00:03:10,571;00:03:11,655;She did.
23;00:03:11,738;00:03:13,821;I don't see an army.
24;00:03:13,905;00:03:17,613;I see one man, with one hand.
25;00:03:17,696;00:03:19,446;It appears your sister lied to me.
26;00:03:22,404;00:03:24,571;She lied to me as well.
27;00:03:26,072;00:03:28,780;She never had any intention
27;00:03:26,072;00:03:28,780;of sending her army north.
28;00:03:28,863;00:03:33,780;She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet
28;00:03:28,863;00:03:33,780;and 20,000 fresh troops.
29;00:03:34,821;00:03:36,696;The Golden Company from Essos,
30;00:03:36,780;00:03:38,321;bought and paid for.
31;00:03:38,404;00:03:40,197;Even if we defeat the dead,
32;00:03:40,279;00:03:42,404;she'll have more than enough
32;00:03:40,279;00:03:42,404;to destroy the survivors.
33;00:03:42,488;00:03:43,947;We?
34;00:03:45,113;00:03:46,947;I promised to fight for the living.
35;00:03:47,030;00:03:49,404;I intend to keep that promise.
36;00:03:51,321;00:03:54,780;Your Grace, I know my brother...
36;00:03:51,321;00:03:54,780;Like you knew your sister?
37;00:03:56,613;00:03:59,905;He came here alone, knowing
37;00:03:56,613;00:03:59,905;full well how he'd be received.
38;00:03:59,988;00:04:03,446;Why would he do that
38;00:03:59,988;00:04:03,446;if he weren't telling the truth?
39;00:04:03,529;00:04:06,446;Perhaps he trusts his
39;00:04:03,529;00:04:06,446;little brother to defend him,
40;00:04:06,529;00:04:09,905;right up to the moment
40;00:04:06,529;00:04:09,905;he slits my throat.
41;00:04:09,988;00:04:12,113;You're right.
41;00:04:09,988;00:04:12,113;We can't trust him.
42;00:04:13,279;00:04:15,113;He attacked my father in the streets.
43;00:04:15,197;00:04:17,613;He tried to destroy
43;00:04:15,197;00:04:17,613;my house and my family,
44;00:04:17,696;00:04:18,905;the same as he did yours.
45;00:04:18,988;00:04:20,905;Do you want me to apologize?
46;00:04:20,988;00:04:21,988;I won't.
47;00:04:22,988;00:04:24,321;We were at war.
48;00:04:24,404;00:04:27,072;Everything I did, I did
48;00:04:24,404;00:04:27,072;for my house and my family.
49;00:04:27,155;00:04:28,155;I'd do it all again.
50;00:04:29,488;00:04:31,655;The things we do for love.
51;00:04:38,197;00:04:41,446;So why have you abandoned
51;00:04:38,197;00:04:41,446;your house and family now?
52;00:04:43,446;00:04:45,488;Because this goes beyond loyalty.
53;00:04:48,947;00:04:50,613;This is about survival.
54;00:04:57,613;00:05:00,363;You don't know me well, Your Grace.
55;00:05:02,030;00:05:04,113;But I know Ser Jaime.
56;00:05:04,197;00:05:05,821;He is a man of honor.
57;00:05:06,821;00:05:08,738;I was his captor once.
58;00:05:08,821;00:05:10,404;But when we were both taken prisoner
59;00:05:10,488;00:05:13,446;and the men holding us
59;00:05:10,488;00:05:13,446;tried to force themselves on me,
60;00:05:13,529;00:05:15,030;Ser Jaime defended me.
61;00:05:16,197;00:05:18,696;And lost his hand because of it.
62;00:05:21,446;00:05:26,030;Without him, my lady,
62;00:05:21,446;00:05:26,030;you would not be alive.
63;00:05:26,113;00:05:28,738;He armed me, armored me,
64;00:05:28,821;00:05:30,988;and sent me to find you
64;00:05:28,821;00:05:30,988;and bring you home
65;00:05:31,072;00:05:34,696;because he'd sworn an oath
65;00:05:31,072;00:05:34,696;to your mother.
66;00:05:40,696;00:05:42,238;You vouch for him?
67;00:05:45,197;00:05:46,279;I do.
68;00:05:51,197;00:05:53,238;You would fight beside him?
69;00:05:56,947;00:05:58,238;I would.
70;00:06:02,696;00:06:04,529;I trust you with my life.
71;00:06:05,947;00:06:07,780;If you trust him with yours,
72;00:06:07,863;00:06:10,072;we should let him stay.
73;00:06:15,404;00:06:18,238;What does the Warden
73;00:06:15,404;00:06:18,238;of the North say about it?
74;00:06:23,863;00:06:25,905;We need every man we can get.
75;00:06:35,613;00:06:36,529;Very well.
76;00:06:58,113;00:06:59,613;Thank you, Your Grace.
77;00:07:37,863;00:07:41,030;Either you knew Cersei was lying
77;00:07:37,863;00:07:41,030;and let me believe otherwise,
78;00:07:41,113;00:07:42,363;or you didn't know at all.
79;00:07:42,446;00:07:44,529;Which makes you
79;00:07:42,446;00:07:44,529;either a traitor or a fool.
80;00:07:44,613;00:07:46,863;I was a fool.
80;00:07:44,613;00:07:46,863;Not for the first time.
81;00:07:47,905;00:07:49,947;Cersei still sits on the throne.
82;00:07:50,030;00:07:51,738;If you can't help me take it back,
83;00:07:51,821;00:07:53,780;I'll find another Hand who can.
84;00:07:58,780;00:08:01,072;I suspect one of you
84;00:07:58,780;00:08:01,072;will be wearing this
85;00:08:01,155;00:08:03,238;before it's all over.
86;00:08:09,404;00:08:10,529;Coming through.
87;00:08:56,738;00:08:58,613;Don't you have something better to do?
88;00:08:58,696;00:09:00,988;You make my weapon yet?
89;00:09:01,072;00:09:05,072;Just as soon as I'm done
89;00:09:01,072;00:09:05,072;making a few thousand of these.
90;00:09:05,155;00:09:06,696;You should make mine first.
91;00:09:06,780;00:09:08,821;And make sure it's stronger than this.
92;00:09:10,279;00:09:11,780;It's strong enough.
93;00:09:15,821;00:09:18,821;It's going to be safer
93;00:09:15,821;00:09:18,821;down in the crypt, you know.
94;00:09:20,113;00:09:22,197;Are you going to be down in the crypt?
95;00:09:22,279;00:09:24,404;No, but...
95;00:09:22,279;00:09:24,404;But you're a fighter.
96;00:09:25,613;00:09:26,738;I've done my share.
97;00:09:28,780;00:09:30,321;You've fought them?
98;00:09:30,404;00:09:32,488;I did. Some of them.
99;00:09:33,613;00:09:34,905;How many?
100;00:09:34,988;00:09:35,947;A few.
101;00:09:37,446;00:09:38,655;That was enough.
102;00:09:41,446;00:09:43,072;What are they like?
103;00:09:44,113;00:09:45,113;Bad.
104;00:09:46,821;00:09:47,738;Really bad.
105;00:09:47,821;00:09:49,446;Really bad?
106;00:09:52,155;00:09:55,821;Even a smith's apprentice
106;00:09:52,155;00:09:55,821;can do better than really bad.
107;00:09:55,905;00:09:58,197;What do they look like?
107;00:09:55,905;00:09:58,197;What do they smell like?
108;00:09:58,279;00:10:00,404;How do they move?
108;00:09:58,279;00:10:00,404;How hard are they to kill?
109;00:10:00,488;00:10:02,072;Look, I know you want to fight.
110;00:10:02,155;00:10:05,488;And I know you're not scared
110;00:10:02,155;00:10:05,488;of rapers or murderers or...
111;00:10:05,571;00:10:07,321;This is different. This is...
112;00:10:08,321;00:10:09,696;This is death.
113;00:10:09,780;00:10:11,863;You want to know
113;00:10:09,780;00:10:11,863;what they're like? Death.
114;00:10:11,947;00:10:13,780;That's what they're like.
115;00:10:21,655;00:10:22,947;I know Death.
116;00:10:25,738;00:10:26,821;He's got many faces.
117;00:10:30,155;00:10:32,279;I look forward to seeing this one.
118;00:10:39,863;00:10:42,529;My weapon?
118;00:10:39,863;00:10:42,529;I'll get right on it.
119;00:11:16,655;00:11:18,905;I'm sorry for what I did to you.
120;00:11:22,238;00:11:24,279;You weren't sorry then.
121;00:11:25,488;00:11:28,030;You were protecting your family.
122;00:11:29,363;00:11:31,488;I'm not that person anymore.
123;00:11:31,571;00:11:32,821;You still would be,
124;00:11:32,905;00:11:35,780;if you hadn't pushed me
124;00:11:32,905;00:11:35,780;out of that window.
125;00:11:35,863;00:11:38,529;And I would still be Brandon Stark.
126;00:11:39,529;00:11:42,279;You're not?
126;00:11:39,529;00:11:42,279;No.
127;00:11:42,363;00:11:44,613;I'm something else now.
128;00:11:45,905;00:11:47,571;You're not angry at me.
129;00:11:48,696;00:11:50,155;I'm not angry at anyone.
130;00:11:50,238;00:11:52,238;Why didn't you tell them?
131;00:11:52,321;00:11:54,905;You won't be able to help us
131;00:11:52,321;00:11:54,905;in this fight
132;00:11:54,988;00:11:56,571;if I let them murder you first.
133;00:12:01,488;00:12:03,321;What about afterwards?
134;00:12:03,404;00:12:06,488;How do you know there is an afterwards?
135;00:12:17,113;00:12:18,279;Next up.
136;00:12:24,238;00:12:26,613;Put a marker in the ground!
137;00:12:27,947;00:12:30,238;Bring it up to the wall!
138;00:12:30,321;00:12:32,155;Up to the wall. All right.
139;00:12:32,238;00:12:34,446;All right.
139;00:12:32,238;00:12:34,446;All right.
140;00:12:35,863;00:12:38,655;Well, here we are.
141;00:12:38,738;00:12:40,238;Yes, here we are.
142;00:12:40,321;00:12:41,738;Together again.
143;00:12:45,321;00:12:47,279;And the masses rejoice.
144;00:12:48,988;00:12:51,197;How do they feel about their new queen?
145;00:12:51,279;00:12:52,821;She's your new queen too.
146;00:12:55,113;00:12:56,404;They remember what happened
147;00:12:56,488;00:12:58,947;the last time Targaryens
147;00:12:56,488;00:12:58,947;brought dragons north.
148;00:12:59,780;00:13:00,905;They'll come around
149;00:13:00,988;00:13:02,738;once they see Daenerys is different.
150;00:13:02,821;00:13:05,197;And she is? Different?
151;00:13:05,279;00:13:06,571;She is.
152;00:13:06,655;00:13:08,821;You're sure about her?
152;00:13:06,655;00:13:08,821;I am.
153;00:13:08,905;00:13:11,404;She didn't seem sure about you.
154;00:13:11,488;00:13:13,404;It's hard to blame her.
155;00:13:13,488;00:13:15,446;I made a mistake
155;00:13:13,488;00:13:15,446;common to clever people.
156;00:13:15,529;00:13:18,488;I underestimated my opponents.
156;00:13:15,529;00:13:18,488;Hmm.
157;00:13:18,571;00:13:21,821;Cersei told me the pregnancy
157;00:13:18,571;00:13:21,821;had changed her.
158;00:13:21,905;00:13:23,780;A chance for you both to start again.
159;00:13:23,863;00:13:25,155;And I believed her.
160;00:13:25,238;00:13:26,905;That stuff can go on the end.
161;00:13:26,988;00:13:29,655;Was she lying about the baby too?
162;00:13:31,321;00:13:33,321;No, that part is real.
163;00:13:36,780;00:13:40,321;She's always been good
163;00:13:36,780;00:13:40,321;at using the truth to tell lies.
164;00:13:40,404;00:13:42,238;I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.
165;00:13:42,321;00:13:43,947;She's fooled me more than anybody.
166;00:13:44,030;00:13:46,197;No, he's right there.
167;00:13:46,279;00:13:47,947;What?
168;00:13:48,030;00:13:50,446;She never fooled you.
169;00:13:50,529;00:13:53,197;You always knew exactly what she was,
170;00:13:53,279;00:13:54,696;and you loved her anyway.
171;00:14:06,197;00:14:07,238;So...
172;00:14:08,571;00:14:11,905;...we're going to die
172;00:14:08,571;00:14:11,905;at Winterfell.
173;00:14:13,404;00:14:15,905;Not the death I would've chosen.
174;00:14:17,072;00:14:18,613;I always pictured myself
175;00:14:18,696;00:14:20,571;dying in my own bed,
176;00:14:20,655;00:14:22,030;the age of 80,
177;00:14:22,113;00:14:24,738;with a belly full of wine and
177;00:14:22,113;00:14:24,738;...a girl's mouth
178;00:14:24,821;00:14:27,072;around your cock.
178;00:14:24,821;00:14:27,072;around my cock.
179;00:14:31,571;00:14:33,404;At least Cersei won't get to murder me.
180;00:14:33,488;00:14:36,030;I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction
181;00:14:36,113;00:14:37,571;denying her that pleasure
182;00:14:37,655;00:14:40,655;while I'm being ripped apart
182;00:14:37,655;00:14:40,655;by dead men.
183;00:14:43,905;00:14:45,738;Maybe after I'm dead...
184;00:14:46,863;00:14:48,571;I'll march down to King's Landing
185;00:14:48,655;00:14:49,947;and rip her apart.
186;00:14:50,030;00:14:51,947;You will see the Army of the Dead.
187;00:15:03,321;00:15:04,321;Good.
188;00:15:21,655;00:15:23,821;Good. Yes, aim.
189;00:15:27,197;00:15:28,404;Don't rush.
190;00:15:28,488;00:15:29,488;Come forward.
191;00:15:31,404;00:15:33,238;Come on.
191;00:15:31,404;00:15:33,238;Ser Jaime.
192;00:15:33,321;00:15:34,988;Lady Brienne.
193;00:15:42,488;00:15:45,738;He's come a long way.
193;00:15:42,488;00:15:45,738;He's all right.
194;00:15:45,821;00:15:47,363;One more time. Come on.
195;00:15:47,446;00:15:50,738;Still has a lot to learn.
195;00:15:47,446;00:15:50,738;I'm sure you'll teach him.
196;00:15:50,821;00:15:52,030;Better, better.
197;00:15:52,113;00:15:54,571;I've been told you're commanding
197;00:15:52,113;00:15:54,571;the left flank.
198;00:15:54,655;00:15:55,988;I am.
199;00:15:56,072;00:15:58,821;It's, uh... It's good ground.
200;00:15:58,905;00:16:00,529;It is.
201;00:16:00,613;00:16:03,404;The rise, it should give us
201;00:16:00,613;00:16:03,404;some advantage.
202;00:16:03,488;00:16:05,030;If we can keep a tight formation,
203;00:16:05,113;00:16:07,113;we might be able to beat them back.
204;00:16:07,238;00:16:09,446;Yes, I think you're right.
205;00:16:09,529;00:16:11,279;What are you doing?
205;00:16:09,529;00:16:11,279;What?
206;00:16:11,363;00:16:14,030;I think you know.
206;00:16:11,363;00:16:14,030;I truly don't.
207;00:16:14,113;00:16:16,363;We have never had a conversation
207;00:16:14,113;00:16:16,363;last this long
208;00:16:16,446;00:16:18,155;without you insulting me.
208;00:16:16,446;00:16:18,155;Not once.
209;00:16:18,238;00:16:19,321;You want me to insult you?
210;00:16:19,404;00:16:20,529;No!
210;00:16:19,404;00:16:20,529;Good.
211;00:16:27,363;00:16:29,529;I came to Winterfell because...
212;00:16:34,571;00:16:36,696;I'm not the fighter I used to be.
213;00:16:38,571;00:16:41,113;But I'd be honored
213;00:16:38,571;00:16:41,113;to serve under your command,
214;00:16:41,197;00:16:42,571;if you'll have me.
215;00:16:51,821;00:16:53,363;I better get back.
216;00:17:14,404;00:17:15,905;Forgive me, khaleesi.
217;00:17:18,279;00:17:20,655;Have you done something to offend me?
218;00:17:20,738;00:17:21,863;Many things.
219;00:17:21,947;00:17:24,238;Long ago and long forgiven.
220;00:17:24,321;00:17:25,863;But you did forgive,
221;00:17:26,863;00:17:28,404;despite my failures.
222;00:17:30,947;00:17:34,321;When I heard you'd named Tyrion
222;00:17:30,947;00:17:34,321;your Hand,
223;00:17:35,613;00:17:37,529;it broke my heart.
224;00:17:37,613;00:17:39,279;When I named him Hand,
225;00:17:39,363;00:17:42,197;I didn't know
225;00:17:39,363;00:17:42,197;if I'd ever see you again.
226;00:17:42,279;00:17:44,155;You made the right choice.
227;00:17:44,238;00:17:47,030;I wasn't under the impression
227;00:17:44,238;00:17:47,030;you liked him very much.
228;00:17:47,113;00:17:48,363;I didn't.
229;00:17:48,446;00:17:49,905;His mouth hardly stopped moving
230;00:17:49,988;00:17:51,446;between Volantis and Meereen.
231;00:17:51,529;00:17:54,155;It was all I could do
231;00:17:51,529;00:17:54,155;not to throw him in the sea.
232;00:17:57,905;00:18:00,821;But the mind behind all those words...
233;00:18:03,030;00:18:05,030;He's made mistakes.
234;00:18:05,113;00:18:06,571;Serious mistakes.
235;00:18:08,446;00:18:09,613;As have we all.
236;00:18:11,321;00:18:12,696;He owns his
237;00:18:13,780;00:18:15,030;and learns from them.
238;00:18:16,321;00:18:18,155;You're advising me to forgive the man
239;00:18:18,238;00:18:19,488;who stole your position?
240;00:18:21,072;00:18:22,155;I am.
241;00:18:23,529;00:18:25,321;And one other suggestion,
242;00:18:25,404;00:18:27,738;if you'll allow me.
243;00:18:27,821;00:18:30,279;The moment we can get
243;00:18:27,821;00:18:30,279;the last infantryman
244;00:18:30,363;00:18:32,821;out onto the field,
244;00:18:30,363;00:18:32,821;we should shut the gates.
245;00:18:32,905;00:18:34,988;Keep them open for as long as you can.
246;00:18:35,072;00:18:37,988;There are still people coming in
246;00:18:35,072;00:18:37,988;from the countryside.
247;00:18:43,655;00:18:46,279;Lady Sansa, I was hoping
247;00:18:43,655;00:18:46,279;we could speak alone.
248;00:19:04,321;00:19:05,488;I thought you and I
249;00:19:05,571;00:19:07,488;were on the verge of agreement before.
250;00:19:07,571;00:19:08,571;About Ser Jaime.
251;00:19:10,613;00:19:14,113;Brienne has been loyal to me, always.
252;00:19:14,197;00:19:16,446;I trust her more than anyone.
253;00:19:16,529;00:19:19,529;I wish I could have that kind
253;00:19:16,529;00:19:19,529;of faith in my advisors.
254;00:19:20,571;00:19:22,780;Tyrion is a good man.
255;00:19:22,863;00:19:25,529;He was never anything
255;00:19:22,863;00:19:25,529;but decent towards me.
256;00:19:25,613;00:19:29,655;I didn't ask him to be my Hand
256;00:19:25,613;00:19:29,655;simply because he was good.
257;00:19:29,738;00:19:31,613;I asked him to be my Hand
258;00:19:31,696;00:19:34,613;because he was good, and intelligent,
259;00:19:34,696;00:19:37,072;and ruthless when he had to be.
260;00:19:38,529;00:19:40,404;He never should have trusted Cersei.
261;00:19:41,488;00:19:43,571;You never should have either.
262;00:19:47,072;00:19:48,780;I thought he knew his sister.
263;00:19:50,613;00:19:52,404;Families are complicated.
264;00:19:53,780;00:19:55,696;Ours certainly have been.
265;00:19:57,655;00:19:59,947;A sad thing to have in common.
266;00:20:01,947;00:20:03,988;We have other things in common.
267;00:20:04,072;00:20:06,155;We've both known what it means
267;00:20:04,072;00:20:06,155;to lead people
268;00:20:06,238;00:20:09,613;who aren't inclined
268;00:20:06,238;00:20:09,613;to accept a woman's rule.
269;00:20:09,696;00:20:11,821;And we've both done
269;00:20:09,696;00:20:11,821;a damn good job of it,
270;00:20:11,905;00:20:13,613;from what I can tell.
271;00:20:15,821;00:20:20,905;And yet, I can't help but feel
271;00:20:15,821;00:20:20,905;we're at odds with one another.
272;00:20:22,072;00:20:23,155;Why is that?
273;00:20:27,613;00:20:28,571;Your brother.
274;00:20:31,947;00:20:33,738;He loves you, you know that.
275;00:20:35,404;00:20:36,571;That bothers you.
276;00:20:36,655;00:20:40,197;Men do stupid things for women.
277;00:20:40,279;00:20:42,321;They're easily manipulated.
278;00:20:45,613;00:20:48,197;All my life, I've known one goal:
279;00:20:48,279;00:20:49,738;the Iron Throne.
280;00:20:50,738;00:20:52,197;Taking it back from the people
281;00:20:52,279;00:20:55,321;who destroyed my family,
281;00:20:52,279;00:20:55,321;and almost destroyed yours.
282;00:20:55,404;00:20:57,947;My war was against them.
283;00:21:00,155;00:21:01,613;Until I met Jon.
284;00:21:03,780;00:21:06,363;Now I'm here, half a world away,
285;00:21:06,446;00:21:08,905;fighting Jon's war alongside him.
286;00:21:08,988;00:21:12,155;Tell me, who manipulated whom?
287;00:21:19,863;00:21:23,947;I should have thanked you
287;00:21:19,863;00:21:23,947;the moment you arrived.
288;00:21:25,279;00:21:26,655;That was a mistake.
289;00:21:29,488;00:21:31,613;I'm here because I love your brother...
290;00:21:33,279;00:21:35,321;and I trust him...
291;00:21:35,404;00:21:38,613;and I know he's true to his word.
292;00:21:38,696;00:21:40,404;He's only the second man in my life
293;00:21:40,488;00:21:42,072;I can say that about.
294;00:21:43,863;00:21:45,113;Who was the first?
295;00:21:45,197;00:21:46,947;Someone taller.
296;00:21:52,197;00:21:54,488;And what happens afterwards?
297;00:21:55,988;00:21:59,404;We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei.
298;00:22:00,613;00:22:02,030;What happens then?
299;00:22:03,613;00:22:05,197;I take the Iron Throne.
300;00:22:08,155;00:22:09,404;What about the North?
301;00:22:10,696;00:22:12,613;It was taken from us,
302;00:22:12,696;00:22:14,404;and we took it back.
303;00:22:14,488;00:22:18,113;And we said we'd never bow
303;00:22:14,488;00:22:18,113;to anyone else again.
304;00:22:18,197;00:22:19,738;What about the North?
305;00:22:27,072;00:22:29,988;Apologies, my lady.
305;00:22:27,072;00:22:29,988;Your Grace...
306;00:22:30,072;00:22:31,738;What is it?
307;00:22:53,488;00:22:55,197;My queen.
308;00:22:55,279;00:22:56,613;Your sister?
309;00:22:56,696;00:22:58,655;She only has a few ships,
310;00:22:58,738;00:23:00,197;and she couldn't sail them here.
311;00:23:00,279;00:23:03,321;So she's sailing
311;00:23:00,279;00:23:03,321;to the Iron Islands instead,
312;00:23:03,404;00:23:05,238;to take them back in your name.
313;00:23:05,321;00:23:06,780;But why aren't you with her?
314;00:23:13,238;00:23:15,905;I want to fight for Winterfell,
314;00:23:13,238;00:23:15,905;Lady Sansa...
315;00:23:17,905;00:23:19,655;if you'll have me.
316;00:23:49,947;00:23:51,446;Milord, we're not soldiers.
317;00:23:51,529;00:23:52,821;You are now.
318;00:23:57,155;00:23:59,738;Look, I made it through
318;00:23:57,155;00:23:59,738;most of my years
319;00:23:59,821;00:24:01,655;without ever getting near a fight,
320;00:24:01,738;00:24:04,113;but then I survived
320;00:24:01,738;00:24:04,113;the Battle of the Bastards.
321;00:24:04,197;00:24:05,696;Right outside these walls.
322;00:24:05,780;00:24:09,197;If I can live through that,
322;00:24:05,780;00:24:09,197;you can live through this.
323;00:24:10,738;00:24:13,571;They'll outfit you with weapons
323;00:24:10,738;00:24:13,571;at the forge.
324;00:24:13,655;00:24:14,655;Right that way.
325;00:24:16,488;00:24:17,696;Thank you.
326;00:24:19,446;00:24:21,988;When the time comes,
326;00:24:19,446;00:24:21,988;you'll be down in the crypts.
327;00:24:22,072;00:24:23,571;They're the safest place to be.
328;00:24:23,655;00:24:25,655;Through that archway right over there.
329;00:24:26,488;00:24:27,488;Thank you.
330;00:24:30,155;00:24:32,571;Hey, hey, who's next, lads?
331;00:24:32,655;00:24:35,821;Thank you, sir.
331;00:24:32,655;00:24:35,821;Come back!
332;00:24:35,905;00:24:37,696;Which way should I go?
333;00:24:42,655;00:24:44,780;Which way do you want to go?
334;00:24:44,863;00:24:47,113;All the children will be going below
335;00:24:47,197;00:24:49,446;when the time comes.
336;00:24:49,529;00:24:52,030;But both me brothers were soldiers.
337;00:24:53,988;00:24:56,197;I want to fight too.
338;00:25:00,696;00:25:02,613;That's good to hear.
339;00:25:02,696;00:25:04,613;I'm going to be in the crypt
339;00:25:02,696;00:25:04,613;with my son,
340;00:25:04,696;00:25:06,821;and I'd feel a lot better
340;00:25:04,696;00:25:06,821;with you down there
341;00:25:06,905;00:25:10,279;to protect us.
341;00:25:06,905;00:25:10,279;I'm sure a lot of people would.
342;00:25:15,947;00:25:18,404;All right.
342;00:25:15,947;00:25:18,404;I'll defend the crypt, then.
343;00:25:29,738;00:25:31,363;Riders coming in!
344;00:25:54,529;00:25:56,529;My little crow.
345;00:25:56,613;00:25:57,821;I thought we'd lost you.
346;00:25:58,863;00:26:00,279;Almost.
347;00:26:05,279;00:26:07,113;Put them in the stables.
348;00:26:10,363;00:26:11,863;How did you find each other?
349;00:26:11,947;00:26:13,905;We met up at the Last Hearth.
350;00:26:13,988;00:26:15,821;The dead got there first.
351;00:26:20,072;00:26:21,197;The Umbers?
352;00:26:21,279;00:26:23,279;Fighting for the Night King now.
353;00:26:24,613;00:26:27,030;We had to travel around them
353;00:26:24,613;00:26:27,030;to get here.
354;00:26:27,113;00:26:29,696;Whoever's not here now
355;00:26:29,780;00:26:30,988;is with them.
356;00:26:31,072;00:26:33,905;How long do we have?
357;00:26:33,988;00:26:36,696;Before the sun comes up tomorrow.
358;00:26:42,780;00:26:44,821;The big woman still here?
359;00:26:47,988;00:26:50,072;They're coming.
360;00:26:50,155;00:26:51,155;Next.
361;00:26:51,238;00:26:53,238;We have dragonglass
362;00:26:53,321;00:26:55,446;and Valyrian steel.
363;00:26:59,655;00:27:01,529;But there are too many of them.
364;00:27:02,738;00:27:03,905;Far too many.
365;00:27:05,988;00:27:07,821;Our enemy doesn't tire.
366;00:27:10,072;00:27:11,155;Doesn't stop.
367;00:27:12,863;00:27:13,863;Doesn't feel.
368;00:27:15,279;00:27:18,363;We can't beat them in a straight fight.
369;00:27:18,446;00:27:19,988;So, what can we do?
370;00:27:21,696;00:27:24,905;The Night King made them all.
370;00:27:21,696;00:27:24,905;They follow his command.
371;00:27:25,947;00:27:27,072;If he falls...
372;00:27:28,696;00:27:30,488;Getting to him may be our best chance.
373;00:27:30,571;00:27:33,197;If that's true,
373;00:27:30,571;00:27:33,197;he'll never expose himself.
374;00:27:34,155;00:27:35,238;Yes, he will.
375;00:27:36,529;00:27:38,072;He'll come for me.
376;00:27:39,738;00:27:43,529;He's tried before, many times,
376;00:27:39,738;00:27:43,529;with many Three-Eyed Ravens.
377;00:27:44,613;00:27:45,571;Why?
378;00:27:46,821;00:27:47,863;What does he want?
379;00:27:47,947;00:27:49,529;An endless night.
380;00:27:51,155;00:27:55,113;He wants to erase this world,
380;00:27:51,155;00:27:55,113;and I am its memory.
381;00:27:55,197;00:27:57,404;That's what death is, isn't it?
382;00:27:59,446;00:28:00,571;Forgetting.
383;00:28:03,279;00:28:04,529;Being forgotten.
384;00:28:05,571;00:28:07,072;If we forget where we've been
385;00:28:07,155;00:28:08,197;and what we've done,
386;00:28:08,279;00:28:09,947;we're not men anymore.
387;00:28:10,988;00:28:12,821;Just animals.
388;00:28:12,905;00:28:14,738;Your memories don't come from books.
389;00:28:15,905;00:28:17,905;Your stories aren't just stories.
390;00:28:17,988;00:28:20,488;If I wanted to erase the world of men,
391;00:28:20,571;00:28:21,696;I'd start with you.
392;00:28:22,738;00:28:23,780;How will he find you?
393;00:28:23,863;00:28:25,738;His mark is on me.
394;00:28:27,279;00:28:29,279;He always knows where I am.
395;00:28:29,363;00:28:30,863;We'll put you in the crypt,
396;00:28:30,947;00:28:33,197;where it's safest.
396;00:28:30,947;00:28:33,197;No.
397;00:28:33,279;00:28:34,863;We need to lure him into the open
398;00:28:34,947;00:28:36,696;before his army destroys us all.
399;00:28:36,780;00:28:38,696;I'll wait for him in the Godswood.
400;00:28:38,780;00:28:40,655;You want us to use you as bait?
401;00:28:40,738;00:28:42,529;We're not leaving you alone out there.
402;00:28:42,613;00:28:44,321;He won't be.
402;00:28:42,613;00:28:44,321;I'll stay with him.
403;00:28:45,488;00:28:46,947;With the Ironborn.
404;00:28:49,821;00:28:52,238;I took this castle from you.
405;00:28:52,321;00:28:53,947;Let me defend you now.
406;00:29:02,529;00:29:05,529;We'll hold off the rest of them
406;00:29:02,529;00:29:05,529;for as long as we can.
407;00:29:05,613;00:29:06,863;When the time comes,
408;00:29:06,947;00:29:08,696;Ser Davos and I will be on the walls,
409;00:29:08,780;00:29:10,738;to give you the signal
409;00:29:08,780;00:29:10,738;to light the trench.
410;00:29:10,821;00:29:14,363;Ser Davos is perfectly capable
410;00:29:10,821;00:29:14,363;of waving a torch on his own.
411;00:29:14,446;00:29:16,655;You'll be in the crypt.
412;00:29:16,738;00:29:18,571;Your Grace, I have fought before,
413;00:29:18,655;00:29:19,738;I can do it again.
414;00:29:19,821;00:29:21,321;Alongside the men and women
415;00:29:21,404;00:29:22,363;risking their lives.
416;00:29:22,446;00:29:24,072;There are thousands of them
417;00:29:24,155;00:29:25,738;and only one of you.
418;00:29:25,821;00:29:27,446;You can't fight as well as they can,
419;00:29:27,529;00:29:30,072;but you can think
419;00:29:27,529;00:29:30,072;better than any of them.
420;00:29:30,155;00:29:32,571;You're here because of your mind.
421;00:29:32,655;00:29:34,446;If we survive, I'll need it.
422;00:29:37,571;00:29:40,238;The dragons should give us
422;00:29:37,571;00:29:40,238;an edge in the field.
423;00:29:40,321;00:29:43,863;If they're in the field,
423;00:29:40,321;00:29:43,863;they're not protecting Bran.
424;00:29:43,947;00:29:45,404;We need to be near him.
425;00:29:45,488;00:29:46,363;Not too near,
426;00:29:46,446;00:29:47,738;or the Night King won't come.
427;00:29:47,821;00:29:50,030;But close enough to pursue him
427;00:29:47,821;00:29:50,030;when he does.
428;00:29:50,113;00:29:52,072;Dragonfire will stop him?
429;00:29:52,155;00:29:53,863;I don't know.
430;00:29:53,947;00:29:55,529;No one's ever tried.
431;00:30:02,030;00:30:03,863;We're all going to die.
432;00:30:06,197;00:30:08,655;But at least we die together.
433;00:30:12,363;00:30:14,030;Let's get some rest.
434;00:30:22,821;00:30:23,821;Your Grace.
435;00:30:39,030;00:30:40,988;Do you need help?
436;00:30:41,072;00:30:42,363;No.
437;00:30:43,404;00:30:45,571;You've had a strange journey.
438;00:30:45,655;00:30:47,030;Stranger than most.
439;00:30:49,197;00:30:51,238;I'd like to hear about it.
440;00:30:53,863;00:30:55,821;It's a long story.
441;00:30:55,905;00:30:57,905;If only we were trapped in a castle...
442;00:30:59,238;00:31:02,738;in the middle of winter,
442;00:30:59,238;00:31:02,738;with nowhere to go.
443;00:31:24,613;00:31:25,738;Hello.
444;00:31:45,780;00:31:48,363;When Daenerys takes her throne...
445;00:31:48,446;00:31:50,446;there will be no place for us here.
446;00:31:51,613;00:31:53,988;I am loyal to my queen.
447;00:31:54,072;00:31:57,113;I will fight for her
447;00:31:54,072;00:31:57,113;until her enemies are defeated,
448;00:31:57,197;00:32:00,947;but when the war is over
448;00:31:57,197;00:32:00,947;and she has won...
449;00:32:03,947;00:32:06,780;...do you want
449;00:32:03,947;00:32:06,780;to grow old in this place?
450;00:32:09,238;00:32:11,905;Is there nothing else you want to do,
451;00:32:11,988;00:32:14,113;nothing else you want to see?
452;00:32:16,197;00:32:17,321;Naath.
453;00:32:18,613;00:32:21,155;I'd like to see the beaches again.
454;00:32:23,488;00:32:25,529;Then I will take you there.
455;00:32:25,613;00:32:27,363;My people are peaceful.
456;00:32:28,529;00:32:31,030;We cannot protect ourselves.
457;00:32:31,113;00:32:33,197;My people are not peaceful.
458;00:32:34,113;00:32:35,655;We will protect you.
459;00:32:47,321;00:32:49,030;Yes, sir.
460;00:32:52,321;00:32:54,197;Have you told her yet?
461;00:32:57,363;00:32:58,363;No.
462;00:32:59,696;00:33:00,863;Mm-hmm.
463;00:33:02,072;00:33:03,238;Being careful.
464;00:33:06,529;00:33:07,863;Biding your time.
465;00:33:09,780;00:33:11,863;Waiting for the perfect...
466;00:33:23,821;00:33:25,863;And now our watch begins.
467;00:33:30,529;00:33:32,279;Gilly? Little Sam?
468;00:33:34,155;00:33:36,905;They'll be safe down in the crypt.
469;00:33:38,613;00:33:40,072;If you want to join them...
470;00:33:45,030;00:33:46,197;To protect them.
471;00:33:46,279;00:33:47,863;Everyone seems to forget that I was
472;00:33:47,947;00:33:49,321;the first man to kill a White Walker.
473;00:33:49,404;00:33:51,488;I've killed Thenns.
473;00:33:49,404;00:33:51,488;Thenn.
474;00:33:51,571;00:33:53,030;I've saved Gilly more than once.
475;00:33:53,113;00:33:54,988;I stole a considerable number of books
476;00:33:55,072;00:33:56,238;from the Citadel library,
477;00:33:56,321;00:33:58,780;survived the Fist of the First Men.
478;00:33:58,863;00:34:01,030;You need me out there.
479;00:34:01,113;00:34:02,655;Well, if that's what it's come to,
480;00:34:02,738;00:34:05,238;we really are fucked.
480;00:34:02,738;00:34:05,238;Well, calling you fucked
481;00:34:05,321;00:34:06,905;wouldn't be strictly accurate.
482;00:34:10,738;00:34:12,363;Samwell Tarly.
483;00:34:12,446;00:34:15,030;Slayer of White Walkers.
484;00:34:15,113;00:34:16,780;Lover of Ladies.
485;00:34:18,238;00:34:19,821;As if we needed any more signs
486;00:34:19,905;00:34:20,988;the world was ending.
487;00:34:23,238;00:34:24,905;Think back to where we started.
488;00:34:27,446;00:34:30,905;Us, Grenn, Pyp.
489;00:34:32,446;00:34:34,821;Now it's just us three.
490;00:34:34,905;00:34:38,571;Last man left, burn the rest of us.
491;00:34:53,988;00:34:55,613;I wish Father were here.
492;00:34:58,238;00:35:00,197;I would love to see
492;00:34:58,238;00:35:00,197;the look on his face
493;00:35:00,279;00:35:01,905;when he realizes his two sons
494;00:35:01,988;00:35:04,321;are about to die defending Winterfell.
495;00:35:09,030;00:35:10,947;That would be something to see.
496;00:35:17,155;00:35:20,321;I remember the first time we were here,
497;00:35:20,404;00:35:22,238;the first time I saw this hall.
498;00:35:22,321;00:35:23,238;Mm.
499;00:35:23,321;00:35:24,863;You were a golden lion.
500;00:35:26,030;00:35:28,738;I was a drunken whoremonger.
501;00:35:28,821;00:35:30,113;It was all so simple.
502;00:35:31,321;00:35:33,529;It wasn't so simple.
503;00:35:33,613;00:35:35,072;I was sleeping with my sister
504;00:35:35,155;00:35:37,780;and you had one friend in the world
505;00:35:37,863;00:35:39,363;who was sleeping with his sister.
506;00:35:39,446;00:35:41,696;I was speaking in relative terms.
507;00:35:43,488;00:35:46,155;Do you miss it?
507;00:35:43,488;00:35:46,155;Of course I miss it.
508;00:35:47,696;00:35:49,780;Well, my golden-lion days are done,
509;00:35:49,863;00:35:52,529;but whoremongering
509;00:35:49,863;00:35:52,529;is still an option for you.
510;00:35:53,655;00:35:54,696;It's not.
511;00:35:56,197;00:35:59,072;Things would be easier if it were.
512;00:36:01,947;00:36:03,863;The perils of self-betterment.
513;00:36:09,363;00:36:11,279;Oh!
514;00:36:11,363;00:36:12,863;My lady.
515;00:36:12,947;00:36:14,821;Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt.
516;00:36:14,905;00:36:16,988;We were just looking for
516;00:36:14,905;00:36:16,988;somewhere warm to...
517;00:36:17,072;00:36:18,863;To contemplate your imminent death.
518;00:36:18,947;00:36:20,780;You've come to the right place.
519;00:36:20,863;00:36:23,279;You want some of this piss?
519;00:36:20,863;00:36:23,279;It's not bad.
520;00:36:23,363;00:36:25,655;It's not good either.
520;00:36:23,363;00:36:25,655;Thank you, milord.
521;00:36:25,738;00:36:27,655;I don't think that's wise.
522;00:36:27,738;00:36:30,238;The battle might start at any moment.
523;00:36:32,988;00:36:34,113;Half cup.
524;00:36:36,197;00:36:38,155;And you?
524;00:36:36,197;00:36:38,155;No, thank you.
525;00:36:38,238;00:36:39,738;I should try and get some sleep.
526;00:36:39,821;00:36:41,404;You really think any of us
527;00:36:41,488;00:36:42,905;are going to sleep tonight?
528;00:36:44,155;00:36:45,363;Join us.
529;00:36:47,238;00:36:48,488;All right.
530;00:36:48,571;00:36:49,905;Just a bit.
531;00:36:56,363;00:36:57,988;Well, what do we have here?
532;00:36:58,072;00:36:59,363;Ser Davos, join us.
533;00:36:59,446;00:37:00,529;No, not for me, thanks.
534;00:37:00,613;00:37:01,988;Came here for this.
535;00:37:02,072;00:37:04,446;I figured I could wait to die
536;00:37:04,529;00:37:07,446;freezing my balls off out there
537;00:37:07,529;00:37:10,321;or wait to die nice and warm in here.
538;00:37:13,279;00:37:16,571;It could be our last night
538;00:37:13,279;00:37:16,571;in this world, you know.
539;00:37:17,780;00:37:20,863;Yes, well, I'm glad you're here.
540;00:37:20,947;00:37:22,696;Here fighting with us.
541;00:37:22,780;00:37:24,780;Glad you survived Eastwatch.
542;00:37:24,863;00:37:26,488;Would you like a drink?
543;00:37:27,446;00:37:28,488;Brought my own.
544;00:37:35,655;00:37:37,655;They call you King Killer.
545;00:37:38,655;00:37:40,529;I'm sure someone does.
546;00:37:41,571;00:37:43,655;They call me Giantsbane.
547;00:37:44,988;00:37:46,113;Want to know why?
548;00:37:56,655;00:37:59,780;I killed a giant when I was 10.
549;00:38:01,488;00:38:05,155;Then I climbed right into bed
549;00:38:01,488;00:38:05,155;with his wife.
550;00:38:06,446;00:38:09,947;When she woke up,
550;00:38:06,446;00:38:09,947;you know what she did?
551;00:38:13,238;00:38:17,738;Suckled me at her teat
551;00:38:13,238;00:38:17,738;for three months.
552;00:38:17,821;00:38:19,655;Thought I was her baby.
553;00:38:20,613;00:38:22,863;That's how I got so strong.
554;00:38:24,529;00:38:26,030;Giant's milk.
555;00:38:40,363;00:38:41,529;Mm.
556;00:38:44,363;00:38:45,947;Maybe I will have that drink.
557;00:39:24,905;00:39:26,155;You never used to shut up.
558;00:39:26,238;00:39:28,696;Now you're just sitting there
558;00:39:26,238;00:39:28,696;like a mute.
559;00:39:31,988;00:39:33,279;Guess I've changed.
560;00:39:41,780;00:39:44,072;What are you doing up here?
561;00:39:44,155;00:39:46,030;What's it look like?
562;00:39:46,113;00:39:48,947;No, I mean, what are you doing up here?
563;00:39:51,446;00:39:52,988;You joined the Brotherhood.
564;00:39:53,072;00:39:54,696;You went beyond the Wall with Jon.
565;00:39:54,780;00:39:56,279;You're here now. Why?
566;00:39:58,238;00:39:59,363;When was the last time
567;00:39:59,446;00:40:01,655;you fought for anyone but yourself?
568;00:40:04,363;00:40:06,446;I fought for you, didn't I?
569;00:40:16,613;00:40:18,696;Oh, for fuck's sake.
570;00:40:18,780;00:40:20,613;May as well be at a bloody wedding.
571;00:40:23,529;00:40:24,988;My lady.
572;00:40:25,072;00:40:27,155;It's good to see you again.
573;00:40:27,279;00:40:29,613;I'm sorry we parted the way we did.
574;00:40:30,821;00:40:32,363;Was he on your list?
575;00:40:33,446;00:40:34,655;For a little while.
576;00:40:35,738;00:40:36,988;That's all right.
577;00:40:38,821;00:40:41,780;The Lord of Light has brought us
577;00:40:38,821;00:40:41,780;together all the same.
578;00:40:43,905;00:40:45,863;This is his moment.
579;00:40:45,947;00:40:47,988;When light...
579;00:40:45,947;00:40:47,988;Thoros isn't here anymore,
580;00:40:48,072;00:40:50,905;so I hope you're not
580;00:40:48,072;00:40:50,905;about to give a sermon.
581;00:40:50,988;00:40:52,446;Because if you are,
582;00:40:52,529;00:40:55,738;the Lord of Light's gonna wonder
582;00:40:52,529;00:40:55,738;why he brought you back 19 times
583;00:40:55,821;00:40:57,321;just to watch you die when I chuck you
584;00:40:57,404;00:40:59,655;over this fucking wall.
585;00:41:13,030;00:41:14,197;Where are you going?
586;00:41:15,738;00:41:17,404;I'm not spending my final hours
587;00:41:17,488;00:41:19,529;with you two miserable old shits.
588;00:41:43,780;00:41:45,363;That for me?
589;00:41:59,446;00:42:01,072;This'll work.
590;00:42:04,446;00:42:05,655;Last time you saw me,
591;00:42:05,738;00:42:07,571;you wanted me to come to Winterfell.
592;00:42:08,655;00:42:10,030;Took the long road, but...
593;00:42:11,780;00:42:13,863;What did the Red Woman want with you?
594;00:42:18,321;00:42:21,821;She wanted my blood
594;00:42:18,321;00:42:21,821;for some kind of spell.
595;00:42:21,905;00:42:23,404;Why your blood?
596;00:42:25,030;00:42:26,696;I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.
597;00:42:28,321;00:42:30,404;I didn't know until she told me.
598;00:42:30,488;00:42:32,696;Then she tied me up, stripped me down,
599;00:42:32,780;00:42:34,155;put leeches all over me.
600;00:42:37,529;00:42:39,488;Was that your first time?
601;00:42:39,571;00:42:42,279;No, yeah, I've never had leeches
601;00:42:39,571;00:42:42,279;put all over my cock.
602;00:42:42,363;00:42:44,321;Your first time with a woman.
603;00:42:44,404;00:42:46,197;What?
604;00:42:46,279;00:42:48,738;I... I didn't...
604;00:42:46,279;00:42:48,738;I wasn't with her.
605;00:42:48,821;00:42:52,197;Were you with other girls
605;00:42:48,821;00:42:52,197;before that in King's Landing?
606;00:42:52,279;00:42:53,947;Or after?
607;00:42:58,072;00:42:59,905;You don't remember?
608;00:43:01,613;00:43:03,571;Yes, I was.
608;00:43:01,613;00:43:03,571;One?
609;00:43:04,780;00:43:06,030;Two?
610;00:43:06,113;00:43:08,655;Twenty?
610;00:43:06,113;00:43:08,655;Well, I didn't keep count.
611;00:43:10,613;00:43:11,571;Yes, you did.
612;00:43:14,947;00:43:16,488;Three.
613;00:43:22,155;00:43:24,655;We're probably going to die soon.
614;00:43:27,279;00:43:29,988;I want to know what it's like
614;00:43:27,279;00:43:29,988;before that happens.
615;00:43:36,279;00:43:37,696;Arya, I...
616;00:44:13,821;00:44:15,988;I'm not the Red Woman.
617;00:44:16,072;00:44:17,738;Take your own bloody pants off.
618;00:44:42,529;00:44:44,738;It's strange, isn't it?
619;00:44:47,238;00:44:50,446;Almost everyone here's
619;00:44:47,238;00:44:50,446;fought the Starks
620;00:44:50,529;00:44:52,655;at one time or another.
621;00:44:52,738;00:44:57,279;And here we are in their castle,
621;00:44:52,738;00:44:57,279;ready to defend it.
622;00:44:57,363;00:44:58,571;Together.
623;00:45:01,404;00:45:03,404;At least we'll die with honor.
624;00:45:09,238;00:45:10,821;I think we might live.
625;00:45:14,488;00:45:16,072;I... I do.
626;00:45:17,696;00:45:20,446;How many battles
626;00:45:17,696;00:45:20,446;have we survived between us?
627;00:45:21,780;00:45:23,113;Ser Davos Seaworth.
628;00:45:24,072;00:45:26,113;Survivor of both the Blackwater
629;00:45:26,197;00:45:28,279;and the Battle of the Bastards.
630;00:45:28,363;00:45:29,488;All without a shred
631;00:45:29,571;00:45:31,404;of combat ability.
631;00:45:29,571;00:45:31,404;Mm.
632;00:45:31,488;00:45:35,446;Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero
632;00:45:31,488;00:45:35,446;of the Siege of Pyke.
633;00:45:35,529;00:45:38,197;Fabled loser of the Battle
633;00:45:35,529;00:45:38,197;of Whispering Wood.
634;00:45:38,279;00:45:39,279;Hear, hear!
635;00:45:40,655;00:45:42,279;Ser Brienne of Tarth.
636;00:45:42,363;00:45:44,488;Defeated the Hound in...
637;00:45:45,446;00:45:47,696;Pardon me, Lady Brienne.
638;00:45:47,780;00:45:49,821;She's not a ser?
639;00:45:49,905;00:45:50,988;You're not a knight?
640;00:45:52,446;00:45:53,821;Women can't be knights.
641;00:45:53,905;00:45:55,905;Why not?
641;00:45:53,905;00:45:55,905;Tradition.
642;00:45:55,988;00:45:57,072;Fuck tradition.
643;00:45:58,321;00:46:00,947;I don't even want to be a knight.
644;00:46:04,571;00:46:05,655;I'm no king.
645;00:46:05,738;00:46:08,030;But if I were,
646;00:46:08,113;00:46:10,863;I'd knight you 10 times over.
647;00:46:12,863;00:46:14,488;You don't need a king.
648;00:46:15,655;00:46:18,613;Any knight can make another knight.
649;00:46:23,571;00:46:24,613;I'll prove it.
650;00:46:27,780;00:46:30,321;Kneel, Lady Brienne.
651;00:46:34,197;00:46:36,321;Do you want to be a knight or not?
652;00:46:41,113;00:46:42,113;Kneel.
653;00:47:35,780;00:47:37,404;In the name of the Warrior,
654;00:47:38,363;00:47:40,072;I charge you to be brave.
655;00:47:42,363;00:47:44,404;In the name of the Father,
656;00:47:45,863;00:47:47,696;I charge you to be just.
657;00:47:50,780;00:47:52,571;In the name of the Mother,
658;00:47:52,655;00:47:55,905;I charge you to defend the innocent.
659;00:48:04,780;00:48:07,155;Arise, Brienne of Tarth...
660;00:48:08,613;00:48:11,072;a knight of the Seven Kingdoms.
661;00:48:28,279;00:48:30,072;Ser Brienne of Tarth!
662;00:48:31,446;00:48:33,279;Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!
663;00:48:43,197;00:48:45,197;We have all we need to win this war.
664;00:48:45,279;00:48:47,780;I have trained my men,
664;00:48:45,279;00:48:47,780;women and children.
665;00:48:47,863;00:48:49,738;I have fought before.

666;00:48:49,821;00:48:52,988;Please, listen to me.
666;00:48:49,821;00:48:52,988;You're the future of our house.
667;00:48:53,072;00:48:54,988;I don't need you to remind me of that.
668;00:48:55,072;00:48:58,072;You'll be safer in the crypt.
668;00:48:55,072;00:48:58,072;These things we're fighting...
669;00:48:58,155;00:48:59,696;I will not hide underground.
670;00:48:59,780;00:49:01,571;I pledged to fight for the North,
671;00:49:01,655;00:49:04,238;and I will fight.
671;00:49:01,655;00:49:04,238;I'm meant to relieve you.
672;00:49:04,321;00:49:06,197;You got it?
672;00:49:04,321;00:49:06,197;Yeah, I got it.

674;00:49:11,363;00:49:12,446;It's all right.
675;00:49:13,780;00:49:15,030;We're done here.
676;00:49:21,072;00:49:22,988;I wish you good fortune, cousin.

679;00:49:33,613;00:49:34,863;What have you got there?
680;00:49:36,529;00:49:37,863;It's called Heartsbane.
681;00:49:39,197;00:49:41,279;It's my family sword.
682;00:49:41,363;00:49:42,863;You still have a family.
683;00:49:44,113;00:49:46,863;Yes. And I'd love
683;00:49:44,113;00:49:46,863;to defend them with it.
684;00:49:48,905;00:49:51,072;But I can't really hold it upright.
685;00:49:53,529;00:49:56,821;Your father,
685;00:49:53,529;00:49:56,821;he taught me how to be a man.
686;00:49:58,321;00:49:59,821;How to do what's right.
687;00:50:02,030;00:50:03,321;This is right.
688;00:50:07,529;00:50:09,696;It's Valyrian steel.
689;00:50:11,363;00:50:13,279;I'd be honored if you'd take it.
690;00:50:26,529;00:50:28,238;I'll wield it in his memory...

693;00:50:51,613;00:50:53,488;I hope we win.
694;00:51:02,155;00:51:05,113;We'd better get some rest.
694;00:51:02,155;00:51:05,113;No, let's stay a bit longer.
695;00:51:05,197;00:51:06,404;We're out of wine.

722;00:53:56,696;00:54:00,613;he was decent and kind.
723;00:54:00,696;00:54:01,947;He liked to sing.
724;00:54:03,113;00:54:05,238;Gave money to poor children.
725;00:54:08,072;00:54:09,404;And he raped her.
726;00:54:10,947;00:54:11,988;He didn't.
727;00:54:16,613;00:54:17,613;He loved her.
728;00:54:24,155;00:54:26,446;They were married in secret.
729;00:54:28,030;00:54:29,738;After Rhaegar fell on the Trident,

734;00:54:41,488;00:54:43,571;as she bled to death
