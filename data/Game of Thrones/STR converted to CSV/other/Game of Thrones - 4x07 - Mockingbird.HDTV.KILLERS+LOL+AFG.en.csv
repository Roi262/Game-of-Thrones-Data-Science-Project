161;00:11:22,094;00:11:24,045;Lock him away
162;00:11:24,096;00:11:26,213;or I’ll let Hobb throw him
162;00:11:24,096;00:11:26,213;in tonight’s stew.

164;00:11:37,275;00:11:39,143;Come on, Ghost.
165;00:11:41,196;00:11:45,399;Mance’s army was closing in
165;00:11:41,196;00:11:45,399;on Craster’s Keep when we left.
166;00:11:45,450;00:11:48,235;We saw their campfires
166;00:11:45,450;00:11:48,235;from Osric’s Hill.
167;00:11:48,320;00:11:50,071;They’ll reach the Wall
167;00:11:48,320;00:11:50,071;before the next full moon.
168;00:11:50,122;00:11:52,440;I’m surprised you didn’t
168;00:11:50,122;00:11:52,440;ride over and say hello.
169;00:11:52,474;00:11:54,658;The King-beyond-the-Wall
169;00:11:52,474;00:11:54,658;is your old friend, isn’t he?
170;00:11:54,710;00:11:56,243;We need to prepare.
171;00:11:56,328;00:11:57,661;We’ve been preparing.
172;00:11:57,663;00:11:59,046;We should seal the tunnel.

174;00:12:00,832;00:12:02,333;Plug it with rocks and ice.
175;00:12:02,384;00:12:03,834;Flood it and let it freeze.

176;00:12:03,836;00:12:05,316;we range north?
177;00:12:05,337;00:12:07,338;— We wouldn’t.
177;00:12:05,337;00:12:07,338;— Man: Coward.
178;00:12:07,389;00:12:09,173;You would cut off our legs,
179;00:12:09,224;00:12:10,841;pluck out our eyes,
180;00:12:10,843;00:12:12,760;leave us cowering
180;00:12:10,843;00:12:12,760;behind the Wall
181;00:12:12,811;00:12:14,678;hoping for the storm to pass?
182;00:12:14,680;00:12:17,264;We can’t defend the gate
182;00:12:14,680;00:12:17,264;against 100,000 men.
183;00:12:17,315;00:12:19,767;This castle has stood
183;00:12:17,315;00:12:19,767;for thousands of years.

185;00:12:23,188;00:12:26,273;And in all those centuries, we
185;00:12:23,188;00:12:26,273;have never sealed the tunnel.
186;00:12:26,324;00:12:28,576;Have you ever seen
186;00:12:26,324;00:12:28,576;a giant, Ser Alliser?
187;00:12:28,610;00:12:32,772;I have.
187;00:12:28,610;00:12:32,772;The tunnel’s gate won’t stop them.
188;00:12:32,806;00:12:34,891;The bars on those gates
188;00:12:32,806;00:12:34,891;are four inches thick.
189;00:12:34,893;00:12:36,609;Cold-rolled steel.
190;00:12:36,644;00:12:38,861;And they won’t stop them.
191;00:12:40,364;00:12:43,199;Remind me which order
191;00:12:40,364;00:12:43,199;you belong to, Lord Snow.
192;00:12:43,234;00:12:45,201;The stewards.
193;00:12:45,236;00:12:48,171;Are the stewards responsible
193;00:12:45,236;00:12:48,171;for maintaining the tunnel?
194;00:12:48,205;00:12:50,573;No.
195;00:12:50,658;00:12:52,292;Who would that be?
196;00:12:53,961;00:12:56,079;— The builders.
196;00:12:53,961;00:12:56,079;— Ah, the builders.
197;00:12:56,081;00:12:58,298;First Builder Yarwyck,
198;00:12:58,332;00:13:01,301;Lord Snow here recommends
198;00:12:58,332;00:13:01,301;sealing the tunnel,

199;00:13:01,335;00:13:04,003;to carry out our duties
200;00:13:04,054;00:13:06,839;as sworn brothers
200;00:13:04,054;00:13:06,839;of the Night’s Watch.
201;00:13:06,890;00:13:09,008;Do you agree with him?
202;00:13:17,651;00:13:19,269;No.
203;00:13:20,938;00:13:23,940;Alliser: — Given your deep knowledge
203;00:13:20,938;00:13:23,940;of the wildling army, Lord Snow,
204;00:13:23,942;00:13:27,327;you and Tarly will take
204;00:13:23,942;00:13:27,327;night duties atop the Wall
205;00:13:27,361;00:13:29,245;until the full moon.

208;00:13:33,083;00:13:36,953;First Builder, we’ll need 100 barrels
208;00:13:33,083;00:13:36,953;of pitch brought atop the wall.
209;00:13:36,955;00:13:38,538;Yarwyck: — Aye.

212;00:14:02,313;00:14:04,364;My lord.
213;00:14:06,116;00:14:08,318;You have new clothes.
214;00:14:08,369;00:14:10,653;Do you like ’em?
214;00:14:08,369;00:14:10,653;Eh?
215;00:14:12,156;00:14:14,073;Gloves are doeskin.
216;00:14:14,124;00:14:15,541;Softer than a virgin’s thighs.
217;00:14:15,576;00:14:16,993;I sent for you days ago.
218;00:14:16,995;00:14:19,829;— I’ve been a bit busy.
218;00:14:16,995;00:14:19,829;— Doing what?
219;00:14:22,333;00:14:25,501;My lonesome
219;00:14:22,333;00:14:25,501;bachelor days are over.
220;00:14:27,221;00:14:29,372;I’m to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
221;00:14:30,674;00:14:32,592;Lollys Stokeworth?
222;00:14:32,626;00:14:36,179;She doesn’t strike me
222;00:14:32,626;00:14:36,179;as your sort of girl.
223;00:14:36,230;00:14:39,232;I wouldn’t say I had
223;00:14:36,230;00:14:39,232;a single sort of girl.
224;00:14:39,266;00:14:40,850;She’s dim-witted.
225;00:14:40,852;00:14:42,285;If I wanted wits, I’d marry you.
226;00:14:42,319;00:14:45,238;When my sister arranged
226;00:14:42,319;00:14:45,238;this love match,
227;00:14:45,272;00:14:48,408;did she mention that Lollys
227;00:14:45,272;00:14:48,408;has an older sister?
228;00:14:48,442;00:14:49,859;Falyse.
229;00:14:49,861;00:14:52,245;Aye, I did know
229;00:14:49,861;00:14:52,245;about the older sister.
230;00:14:52,279;00:14:54,330;And you understand
230;00:14:52,279;00:14:54,330;the rules of inheritance?
231;00:14:54,365;00:14:55,665;Falyse is 40 and barren.
232;00:14:55,699;00:14:58,868;She still gets Castle Stokeworth
232;00:14:55,699;00:14:58,868;when her father dies.
233;00:14:58,919;00:15:00,370;She does.
234;00:15:00,372;00:15:02,622;Unless she happens
234;00:15:00,372;00:15:02,622;to perish before her father.
235;00:15:02,673;00:15:04,540;Then Lollys gets the castle.
236;00:15:06,627;00:15:08,594;What? Ladies fall
236;00:15:06,627;00:15:08,594;from their horses
237;00:15:08,629;00:15:10,713;and snap their pretty
237;00:15:08,629;00:15:10,713;necks all the time.
238;00:15:10,764;00:15:13,216;You and my sister
238;00:15:10,764;00:15:13,216;deserve each other.
239;00:15:13,218;00:15:16,052;Why did you bother to come here?
240;00:15:21,809;00:15:25,778;You once said if anyone ever
240;00:15:21,809;00:15:25,778;asked me to sell you out,
241;00:15:25,813;00:15:27,397;you’d double their price.
242;00:15:27,399;00:15:29,732;Is it two wives you want
242;00:15:27,399;00:15:29,732;or two castles?
243;00:15:29,783;00:15:31,484;One of each will do.
244;00:15:31,535;00:15:35,071;But if you want me to kill
244;00:15:31,535;00:15:35,071;the Mountain for you,
245;00:15:35,073;00:15:36,906;it’d better be
245;00:15:35,073;00:15:36,906;a damn big castle.
246;00:15:36,908;00:15:39,292;I’m a bit short
246;00:15:36,908;00:15:39,292;on castles at the moment.
247;00:15:39,326;00:15:41,127;But I can offer you
247;00:15:39,326;00:15:41,127;gold and gratitude.
248;00:15:41,161;00:15:42,829;I have gold.
249;00:15:42,880;00:15:44,297;What can I buy with gratitude?
250;00:15:44,331;00:15:45,882;You might be surprised.
251;00:15:45,916;00:15:48,751;A Lannister always
251;00:15:45,916;00:15:48,751;pays his debts.
252;00:15:48,802;00:15:50,586;Your sister’s a Lannister, too.
253;00:15:50,588;00:15:52,338;My wife is heir to Winterfell.
254;00:15:52,389;00:15:56,225;If I emerge from this with my
254;00:15:52,389;00:15:56,225;head still on my shoulders,
255;00:15:56,260;00:16:00,029;I may one day rule
255;00:15:56,260;00:16:00,029;the North in her name.
256;00:16:00,063;00:16:03,149;I could carve you out
256;00:16:00,063;00:16:03,149;a big piece of it.
257;00:16:03,183;00:16:05,151;If and may and could.
258;00:16:05,185;00:16:07,703;It’s bloody cold up north.
259;00:16:07,738;00:16:10,156;Lollys is soft and warm.
260;00:16:10,190;00:16:11,941;And close.
261;00:16:11,992;00:16:14,660;If I gave you the choice
261;00:16:11,992;00:16:14,660;between fucking Lollys
262;00:16:14,695;00:16:16,662;and fighting the Mountain,
262;00:16:14,695;00:16:16,662;you’d have your britches down
263;00:16:16,697;00:16:18,030;and your cock out
263;00:16:16,697;00:16:18,030;before I could blink.
264;00:16:18,081;00:16:19,866;Does he frighten you so much?
265;00:16:19,917;00:16:22,118;I’d be a bloody fool
265;00:16:19,917;00:16:22,118;if he didn’t frighten me.
266;00:16:22,169;00:16:24,036;He’s freakish big
266;00:16:22,169;00:16:24,036;and freakish strong.
267;00:16:24,087;00:16:26,873;And quicker than you’d expect
267;00:16:24,087;00:16:26,873;for a man of that size.
268;00:16:29,009;00:16:30,510;Maybe I could take him,
269;00:16:30,544;00:16:32,795;dance around until he’s so tired
270;00:16:32,830;00:16:34,564;of hacking at me,
270;00:16:32,830;00:16:34,564;he dropped his sword,
271;00:16:34,598;00:16:36,632;get him off his feet somehow.
272;00:16:36,634;00:16:38,601;But one misstep…
273;00:16:38,635;00:16:40,303;(snaps fingers)
273;00:16:38,635;00:16:40,303;…and I’m dead.
274;00:16:40,354;00:16:42,605;Why should I risk it?
275;00:16:42,639;00:16:45,141;Because you’re my friend.
276;00:16:45,143;00:16:47,310;Aye, I’m your friend.
277;00:16:47,312;00:16:50,730;And when have you ever
277;00:16:47,312;00:16:50,730;risked your life for me?
278;00:17:00,541;00:17:01,908;I like you,
279;00:17:01,959;00:17:04,377;pampered little shit
279;00:17:01,959;00:17:04,377;that you are.
280;00:17:04,411;00:17:06,746;I just like myself more.
281;00:17:06,797;00:17:08,381;I understand.
282;00:17:08,415;00:17:10,082;I’m sorry it has to be this way.
283;00:17:10,133;00:17:11,751;Why are you sorry?
284;00:17:11,802;00:17:13,836;Because you’re an evil bastard
285;00:17:13,838;00:17:15,805;with no conscience and no heart?
286;00:17:15,839;00:17:18,508;That’s what I liked about
286;00:17:15,839;00:17:18,508;you in the first place.
287;00:17:24,932;00:17:27,016;We had some good days together.
288;00:17:27,018;00:17:28,851;Yes, we did.
289;00:17:40,697;00:17:42,365;(bangs on door)
290;00:17:43,500;00:17:45,084;What will you do?
291;00:17:45,118;00:17:48,588;I suppose I’ll have to kill
291;00:17:45,118;00:17:48,588;the Mountain myself.
292;00:17:50,340;00:17:52,542;Won’t that make
292;00:17:50,340;00:17:52,542;for a great song?
293;00:17:55,546;00:17:58,381;I hope to hear
293;00:17:55,546;00:17:58,381;them sing it one day.
294;00:18:06,857;00:18:09,358;(bird screeching)
295;00:18:16,533;00:18:18,150;How did you get in here?
296;00:18:18,201;00:18:19,819;Your door is well guarded,
297;00:18:19,870;00:18:21,988;but your window is not.
298;00:18:28,295;00:18:31,330;I swam to an island
298;00:18:28,295;00:18:31,330;a mile offshore for these.
299;00:18:31,381;00:18:33,883;Don’t do that again.
300;00:18:35,252;00:18:37,837;Never met a woman who
300;00:18:35,252;00:18:37,837;didn’t like wildflowers.
301;00:18:37,888;00:18:40,306;These are my private quarters.
302;00:18:40,340;00:18:42,892;If I want you here,
302;00:18:40,340;00:18:42,892;I will summon you.
303;00:18:44,394;00:18:47,313;Forgive me, my queen.
303;00:18:44,394;00:18:47,313;I live to serve you.
304;00:18:53,437;00:18:55,605;Tell me why you’re here.
305;00:18:59,610;00:19:01,510;I came to ask a favor.
306;00:19:01,578;00:19:03,863;I only have two talents
306;00:19:01,578;00:19:03,863;in this world–
307;00:19:03,914;00:19:06,248;war and women.
308;00:19:06,283;00:19:08,951;You are staying here
308;00:19:06,283;00:19:08,951;in Meereen to rule.
309;00:19:08,953;00:19:11,170;That is a wise decision.
309;00:19:08,953;00:19:11,170;I respect it.
310;00:19:11,204;00:19:13,089;But here in Meereen,
310;00:19:11,204;00:19:13,089;I cannot pursue my talents.
311;00:19:13,123;00:19:15,758;I’ve ordered the Second Sons
311;00:19:13,123;00:19:15,758;to patrol the streets
312;00:19:15,792;00:19:17,510;to stop the revenge killing.
313;00:19:17,544;00:19:18,794;You’ve ordered us
313;00:19:17,544;00:19:18,794;to be night watchmen.
314;00:19:18,845;00:19:20,796;And as for women,
315;00:19:20,798;00:19:24,550;there are thousands
315;00:19:20,798;00:19:24,550;in Meereen you can pursue.
316;00:19:25,552;00:19:27,353;There is only one,
317;00:19:27,387;00:19:30,022;and she does not want me.
318;00:19:31,558;00:19:32,858;You swore me your sword.
319;00:19:32,893;00:19:35,478;My sword is yours
319;00:19:32,893;00:19:35,478;till the day I die.
320;00:19:35,480;00:19:37,647;So if I command you
320;00:19:35,480;00:19:37,647;to stay in Meereen
321;00:19:37,698;00:19:39,148;and patrol the streets?
322;00:19:39,150;00:19:41,867;I’ll stay in Meereen
322;00:19:39,150;00:19:41,867;and patrol the streets.
323;00:19:41,902;00:19:44,387;Send me to kill your enemies.
324;00:19:44,421;00:19:46,706;Any enemy anywhere.
325;00:19:47,791;00:19:50,292;Let me do what I do best.
326;00:19:51,695;00:19:53,496;Very well.
327;00:19:59,503;00:20:01,554;Do what you do best.
328;00:20:12,399;00:20:14,600;Take off your clothes.
329;00:20:41,428;00:20:43,713;(knocks)
330;00:20:43,715;00:20:45,347;Oh.
331;00:20:46,550;00:20:48,601;Come in, my queen.
331;00:20:46,550;00:20:48,601;Please.
332;00:20:48,635;00:20:50,553;I didn’t mean
332;00:20:48,635;00:20:50,553;to disturb you, my lady.
333;00:20:50,604;00:20:52,104;You could never disturb me.
334;00:20:52,139;00:20:54,523;I just wanted to speak
334;00:20:52,139;00:20:54,523;with you before we left.
335;00:20:54,558;00:20:57,393;Could you bring me
335;00:20:54,558;00:20:57,393;that vial over there?
336;00:21:00,230;00:21:01,864;The blue one.
337;00:21:03,784;00:21:06,402;No, no, no.
337;00:21:03,784;00:21:06,402;Not that one.
338;00:21:06,404;00:21:08,621;You don’t even want
338;00:21:06,404;00:21:08,621;to touch that one.
339;00:21:08,655;00:21:10,823;Next to it.
340;00:21:10,874;00:21:12,875;That’s the one.
341;00:21:22,586;00:21:24,670;(inhales)
342;00:21:31,511;00:21:33,562;When I looked into
342;00:21:31,511;00:21:33,562;the flames this morning,
343;00:21:33,597;00:21:35,815;the Lord spoke to me.
344;00:21:35,849;00:21:37,733;He said,
345;00:21:37,768;00:21:42,238;«Tonight, you will have your
345;00:21:37,768;00:21:42,238;last good bath in a long while.
346;00:21:42,272;00:21:44,490;Make it count.»
347;00:21:47,778;00:21:49,111;A joke.
348;00:21:51,031;00:21:52,915;Not a very good one, I’m afraid.
349;00:21:52,949;00:21:54,784;It was. I–
350;00:21:54,786;00:21:57,453;humor isn’t my strength.
351;00:21:57,455;00:21:59,121;That’s because
351;00:21:57,455;00:21:59,121;most jokes are lies
352;00:21:59,123;00:22:01,841;and you’re devoted to the truth.
353;00:22:01,875;00:22:05,127;If they’re lies, my lady,
353;00:22:01,875;00:22:05,127;aren’t they best avoided?
354;00:22:05,129;00:22:07,630;Not always.
355;00:22:16,973;00:22:19,191;Most of these powders
355;00:22:16,973;00:22:19,191;and potions
356;00:22:19,226;00:22:20,810;are lies.
357;00:22:20,861;00:22:25,397;Deceptions to make men think
357;00:22:20,861;00:22:25,397;they witnessed our Lord’s power.
358;00:22:25,448;00:22:28,894;Once they step into his light, they
358;00:22:25,448;00:22:28,894;will see the lie for what it was–
359;00:22:28,945;00:22:32,231;a trick that lead them to the truth.
360;00:22:32,282;00:22:35,034;A pinch of this powder
360;00:22:32,282;00:22:35,034;in a bonfire
361;00:22:35,068;00:22:38,320;will send a flaming column
361;00:22:35,068;00:22:38,320;screaming towards the sky.
362;00:22:38,322;00:22:41,123;And this one creates
362;00:22:38,322;00:22:41,123;a black smoke
363;00:22:41,157;00:22:43,575;that will make the bravest
363;00:22:41,157;00:22:43,575;man piss himself with fear.
364;00:22:43,626;00:22:47,046;And a drop of this
364;00:22:43,626;00:22:47,046;in any man’s wine
365;00:22:47,080;00:22:49,381;will drive him wild with lust.
366;00:22:52,669;00:22:54,837;Did you use it with Stannis?
367;00:22:54,839;00:22:56,221;No.
368;00:22:58,975;00:23:00,509;Don’t be upset.
369;00:23:00,560;00:23:03,762;Men never crave
369;00:23:00,560;00:23:03,762;what they already have.
370;00:23:05,598;00:23:07,516;It’s only flesh.
371;00:23:07,567;00:23:10,185;It needs what it needs.
372;00:23:13,490;00:23:16,408;No act done in service
372;00:23:13,490;00:23:16,408;of the Lord
373;00:23:16,443;00:23:19,244;can ever be called a sin.
374;00:23:19,279;00:23:22,698;I thank God every day
374;00:23:19,279;00:23:22,698;for bringing you to us.
375;00:23:22,749;00:23:25,334;And Stannis to you.
376;00:23:25,368;00:23:29,872;He wants to bring
376;00:23:25,368;00:23:29,872;Shireen with us.
377;00:23:31,124;00:23:34,343;I think that would be
377;00:23:31,124;00:23:34,343;ill-advised.
378;00:23:34,377;00:23:38,013;My daughter has heretical
378;00:23:34,377;00:23:38,013;tendencies, as you’re well aware.
379;00:23:38,047;00:23:41,850;I don’t know if her doubt is real
379;00:23:38,047;00:23:41,850;or simply meant to spite me,
380;00:23:41,885;00:23:45,270;but whichever the case,
380;00:23:41,885;00:23:45,270;she should stay home.
381;00:23:49,559;00:23:51,577;I understand how you feel.
382;00:23:51,611;00:23:52,978;Hmm.
383;00:23:53,029;00:23:55,230;But that is impossible.
384;00:23:58,034;00:24:00,068;Why?
385;00:24:00,070;00:24:03,906;You don’t need powders
385;00:24:00,070;00:24:03,906;and potions, my queen.
386;00:24:03,957;00:24:06,074;You don’t need lies.
387;00:24:06,126;00:24:09,578;You are strong enough to
387;00:24:06,126;00:24:09,578;look into the Lord’s light
388;00:24:09,629;00:24:11,964;and see his truth for yourself.
389;00:24:17,720;00:24:19,922;However harsh it is.
390;00:24:19,924;00:24:22,424;However hard for us
390;00:24:19,924;00:24:22,424;to understand.
391;00:24:24,093;00:24:25,511;You don’t need my help,
392;00:24:25,562;00:24:28,347;but I will need yours soon.
393;00:24:28,398;00:24:31,433;When we set sail, your
393;00:24:28,398;00:24:31,433;daughter must be with us.
394;00:24:34,938;00:24:37,105;The Lord needs her.
395;00:24:44,447;00:24:46,832;Jorah the Andal.
396;00:24:47,951;00:24:50,169;Are you here to see our queen?
397;00:24:51,921;00:24:54,006;She’s in a good mood.
398;00:25:08,638;00:25:10,973;Khaleesi.
399;00:25:10,975;00:25:13,392;— You’re here early.
399;00:25:10,975;00:25:13,392;— Later than some.
400;00:25:15,695;00:25:17,145;You don’t approve?
401;00:25:17,197;00:25:19,615;It’s not a question of approval,
401;00:25:17,197;00:25:19,615;it’s a question of trust.
402;00:25:19,649;00:25:21,984;You neither approve nor trust.
403;00:25:21,986;00:25:23,619;Why would I?
403;00:25:21,986;00:25:23,619;The man’s a sellsword.
404;00:25:23,653;00:25:25,173;Didn’t you fight for
404;00:25:23,653;00:25:25,173;the Golden Company
405;00:25:25,205;00:25:26,738;before pledging
405;00:25:25,205;00:25:26,738;your sword to my brother?
406;00:25:26,789;00:25:28,457;I did.
407;00:25:28,491;00:25:29,908;I trust you.
408;00:25:29,959;00:25:32,411;Daario Naharis
408;00:25:29,959;00:25:32,411;killed his captains
409;00:25:32,462;00:25:35,631;and dumped their heads at your feet
409;00:25:32,462;00:25:35,631;when he grew tired of their commands.
410;00:25:35,665;00:25:38,166;How could you ever have
410;00:25:35,665;00:25:38,166;faith in a man like that?
411;00:25:38,168;00:25:41,553;I could never have faith
411;00:25:38,168;00:25:41,553;in a man like Daario.
412;00:25:43,089;00:25:45,724;That’s why I’ve sent him and the
412;00:25:43,089;00:25:45,724;Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
413;00:25:47,844;00:25:49,978;— You have?
413;00:25:47,844;00:25:49,978;— I have.
414;00:25:50,013;00:25:52,064;Without you there
414;00:25:50,013;00:25:52,064;to rule, Khaleesi,
415;00:25:52,098;00:25:54,349;I fear the masters
415;00:25:52,098;00:25:54,349;will simply bide their time,
416;00:25:54,400;00:25:56,652;wait for the invaders
416;00:25:54,400;00:25:56,652;to leave and reassert control.
417;00:25:56,686;00:26:00,822;That is why I’ve ordered Daario to
417;00:25:56,686;00:26:00,822;execute every master in Yunkai.
418;00:26:02,242;00:26:04,826;The masters tear babies
418;00:26:02,242;00:26:04,826;from their mothers’ arms.
419;00:26:04,861;00:26:07,329;They mutilate little boys
419;00:26:04,861;00:26:07,329;by the thousands.
420;00:26:07,363;00:26:09,748;They train little girls in the
420;00:26:07,363;00:26:09,748;art of pleasuring old men.
421;00:26:09,782;00:26:12,918;They treat men like beasts,
421;00:26:09,782;00:26:12,918;as you said yourself.
422;00:26:12,952;00:26:16,505;Herding the masters into pens and
422;00:26:12,952;00:26:16,505;slaughtering them by the thousands
423;00:26:16,539;00:26:18,540;is also treating men
423;00:26:16,539;00:26:18,540;like beasts.
424;00:26:18,542;00:26:20,709;The slaves you freed,
425;00:26:20,760;00:26:22,878;brutality is all
425;00:26:20,760;00:26:22,878;they’ve ever known.
426;00:26:22,912;00:26:25,013;If you want them to know
426;00:26:22,912;00:26:25,013;something else,
427;00:26:25,048;00:26:26,381;you’ll have to show it to them.
428;00:26:26,432;00:26:28,517;And repay the slavers
428;00:26:26,432;00:26:28,517;with what? Kindness?
429;00:26:28,551;00:26:30,052;A fine?
429;00:26:28,551;00:26:30,052;A stern warning?
430;00:26:30,054;00:26:33,221;It’s tempting to see your
430;00:26:30,054;00:26:33,221;enemies as evil, all of them,
431;00:26:33,256;00:26:35,974;but there’s good and evil on both
431;00:26:33,256;00:26:35,974;sides in every war ever fought.
432;00:26:36,025;00:26:38,477;Let the priests argue
432;00:26:36,025;00:26:38,477;over good and evil.
433;00:26:38,528;00:26:40,062;Slavery is real.
434;00:26:40,064;00:26:42,314;I can end it.
434;00:26:40,064;00:26:42,314;I will end it.
435;00:26:42,365;00:26:44,650;And I will end those behind it.
436;00:26:44,701;00:26:46,885;I sold men
436;00:26:44,701;00:26:46,885;into slavery, Khaleesi.
437;00:26:46,920;00:26:51,740;And now you are helping me
437;00:26:46,920;00:26:51,740;show them to freedom.
438;00:26:51,791;00:26:55,160;I wouldn’t be here to help you
438;00:26:51,791;00:26:55,160;if Ned Stark had done to me
439;00:26:55,211;00:26:58,046;what you want to do
439;00:26:55,211;00:26:58,046;to the masters of Yunkai.
440;00:27:02,585;00:27:05,470;The man who came to me the other
440;00:27:02,585;00:27:05,470;day about burying his father.
441;00:27:05,505;00:27:07,589;Hizdahr zo Loraq?
442;00:27:07,591;00:27:10,309;He will accompany
442;00:27:07,591;00:27:10,309;the Second Sons
443;00:27:10,343;00:27:12,260;and serve as my
443;00:27:10,343;00:27:12,260;ambassador to Yunkai.
444;00:27:12,312;00:27:15,263;He will tell the masters
444;00:27:12,312;00:27:15,263;what has happened in Meereen.
445;00:27:15,315;00:27:18,900;He will explain the choice
445;00:27:15,315;00:27:18,900;they have before them.
446;00:27:18,935;00:27:20,852;They can live in my new world
447;00:27:20,903;00:27:23,939;or they can die
447;00:27:20,903;00:27:23,939;in their old one.
448;00:27:28,077;00:27:30,529;Well, go and catch Daario
448;00:27:28,077;00:27:30,529;before he leaves.
449;00:27:30,580;00:27:32,447;Tell him I changed my mind.
450;00:27:32,449;00:27:34,833;Yes, Khaleesi.
451;00:27:40,089;00:27:41,790;No.
452;00:27:44,677;00:27:47,379;Tell him you changed my mind.
453;00:27:58,124;00:28:01,043;(Hound grunts)
453;00:27:58,124;00:28:01,043;Rat cunts.
454;00:28:02,478;00:28:04,780;Fucking whore.
455;00:28:06,649;00:28:08,316;You’re doing it wrong.
456;00:28:08,318;00:28:11,286;You need to burn away
456;00:28:08,318;00:28:11,286;that horrible bit there.
457;00:28:11,320;00:28:14,039;Otherwise it’s gonna
457;00:28:11,320;00:28:14,039;get infected and fester.
458;00:28:16,492;00:28:19,494;I know you don’t like fire,
458;00:28:16,492;00:28:19,494;but if you don’t do it right–
459;00:28:19,496;00:28:21,463;No fire.
460;00:28:22,548;00:28:24,750;It’ll only take a second.
461;00:28:24,801;00:28:27,169;— It won’t hurt that much.
461;00:28:24,801;00:28:27,169;— No fire!
462;00:28:41,851;00:28:43,852;Shut up about it.
463;00:28:46,572;00:28:48,607;Shut up about everything.
464;00:28:48,658;00:28:51,326;Thanks to you,
464;00:28:48,658;00:28:51,326;I’m a walking bag of silver
465;00:28:51,360;00:28:53,612;anywhere the Lannisters
465;00:28:51,360;00:28:53,612;hold sway.
466;00:28:55,331;00:28:57,165;Which is everywhere
466;00:28:55,331;00:28:57,165;between where we are now
467;00:28:57,200;00:28:59,201;and where we’re going.
468;00:29:01,704;00:29:04,873;I’m as stupid as that hog
468;00:29:01,704;00:29:04,873;you stuck back in the village,
469;00:29:04,875;00:29:09,044;getting myself cut
469;00:29:04,875;00:29:09,044;and stabbed and bitten.
470;00:29:11,597;00:29:13,965;No reward is worth
470;00:29:11,597;00:29:13,965;this much trouble.
471;00:29:14,016;00:29:16,935;Wish I’d never laid eyes on you.
472;00:29:27,196;00:29:30,198;You say your brother
472;00:29:27,196;00:29:30,198;gave you that sword.
473;00:29:32,568;00:29:34,619;My brother gave me this.
474;00:29:36,622;00:29:38,874;It was just like you said
474;00:29:36,622;00:29:38,874;a while back.
475;00:29:38,908;00:29:40,709;Pressed me to the fire
476;00:29:40,743;00:29:43,628;like I was a nice
476;00:29:40,743;00:29:43,628;juicy mutton chop.
477;00:29:46,716;00:29:48,416;Why?
478;00:29:48,418;00:29:50,302;Thought I stole one of his toys.
479;00:29:50,336;00:29:52,921;I didn’t steal it. I was
479;00:29:50,336;00:29:52,921;just playing with it.
480;00:29:57,810;00:29:59,761;The pain was bad.
481;00:29:59,812;00:30:01,847;The smell was worse.
482;00:30:04,934;00:30:09,187;But the worst thing was that
482;00:30:04,934;00:30:09,187;it was my brother who did it.
483;00:30:13,326;00:30:16,278;My father, who protected him…
484;00:30:18,247;00:30:20,949;told everyone my bedding
484;00:30:18,247;00:30:20,949;caught fire.
485;00:30:33,629;00:30:36,047;You think you’re on your own?
486;00:30:38,938;00:30:40,605;Let me wash it out
487;00:30:40,656;00:30:42,908;and help you sew it up at least.
488;00:31:09,518;00:31:11,803;Brienne: — Bit of comfort
488;00:31:09,518;00:31:11,803;never hurt anyone.
489;00:31:11,805;00:31:14,022;We’ve been sleeping in
489;00:31:11,805;00:31:14,022;ditches the last few weeks.
490;00:31:14,056;00:31:16,891;I think we can treat ourselves
490;00:31:14,056;00:31:16,891;to a featherbed for the night
491;00:31:16,943;00:31:19,811;and a hot meal
491;00:31:16,943;00:31:19,811;not cooked by you.
492;00:31:19,862;00:31:21,313;Couldn’t agree more, my lady.
493;00:31:21,315;00:31:23,231;Just don’t start expecting
493;00:31:21,315;00:31:23,231;silk underclothes.
494;00:31:23,282;00:31:25,483;Not working for your
494;00:31:23,282;00:31:25,483;former lord any longer.
495;00:31:25,534;00:31:27,819;— Yes, my lady.
495;00:31:25,534;00:31:27,819;— Don’t get drunk.
496;00:31:29,538;00:31:30,655;No, my lady.
497;00:31:30,657;00:31:32,157;Hot Pie: — Can I get
497;00:31:30,657;00:31:32,157;you anything else?
498;00:31:32,159;00:31:33,959;No, this will do
498;00:31:32,159;00:31:33,959;nicely, thank you.
499;00:31:33,993;00:31:35,493;Kidney pie is wonderful.
500;00:31:35,544;00:31:37,495;Thanks.
501;00:31:37,497;00:31:39,714;I do my best.
502;00:31:41,334;00:31:43,918;A good kidney pie is all
502;00:31:41,334;00:31:43,918;about the ingredients.
503;00:31:43,970;00:31:46,921;Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk.
504;00:31:46,973;00:31:48,757;Easy enough.
504;00:31:46,973;00:31:48,757;But the meat,
505;00:31:48,808;00:31:51,760;peacetime or not, getting your
505;00:31:48,808;00:31:51,760;hands on a good bottom round steak
506;00:31:51,811;00:31:53,478;and calves’ kidneys is not easy.
507;00:31:53,512;00:31:56,064;I mean, some people settle
507;00:31:53,512;00:31:56,064;for plain old beef kidneys.
508;00:31:56,098;00:31:58,350;Got no right to cook
508;00:31:56,098;00:31:58,350;anything, them.
509;00:31:58,401;00:31:59,985;Oh, and the gravy.
510;00:32:00,019;00:32:01,853;Don’t get me started
510;00:32:00,019;00:32:01,853;on the gravy.
511;00:32:01,855;00:32:03,238;Very difficult to get right.
512;00:32:03,272;00:32:05,073;See, a lot of people
512;00:32:03,272;00:32:05,073;give up on the gravy.
513;00:32:05,107;00:32:07,325;You cannot give up on the gravy.
514;00:32:07,360;00:32:08,910;No gravy, no pie.
515;00:32:08,944;00:32:11,363;Simple as that.
516;00:32:11,365;00:32:14,699;That’s nice armor.
516;00:32:11,365;00:32:14,699;Are you a knight?
517;00:32:16,836;00:32:18,286;No.
518;00:32:18,337;00:32:21,456;Oh, it’s just people with
518;00:32:18,337;00:32:21,456;armor are usually knights.
519;00:32:21,507;00:32:24,175;Generally speaking. From King’s
519;00:32:21,507;00:32:24,175;Landing, though, aren’t you?
520;00:32:24,210;00:32:27,045;From there myself originally.
520;00:32:24,210;00:32:27,045;Flea Bottom born and bred.
521;00:32:27,047;00:32:28,880;What brings you to these parts?
522;00:32:28,882;00:32:30,882;We’re looking for someone.
523;00:32:30,933;00:32:33,385;Someone in particular?
523;00:32:30,933;00:32:33,385;Maybe they came in here.
524;00:32:33,387;00:32:35,747;A lot of people come in here.
524;00:32:33,387;00:32:35,747;Just the other day we had 17–
525;00:32:35,771;00:32:37,722;A girl, tall, red hair,
525;00:32:35,771;00:32:37,722;very pretty.
526;00:32:37,724;00:32:41,226;Her name is Sansa Stark, but she
526;00:32:37,724;00:32:41,226;may be using a different name.
527;00:32:41,277;00:32:43,228;Starks?
528;00:32:46,365;00:32:49,234;What, like them lot
528;00:32:46,365;00:32:49,234;from «Winterhell»?
529;00:32:52,655;00:32:54,789;No, ain’t seen anyone like that.
530;00:32:54,824;00:32:56,574;I heard they was all traitors.
531;00:32:56,576;00:32:58,910;Don’t need no traitors in here.
532;00:32:58,912;00:33:02,247;I pledged my life to
532;00:32:58,912;00:33:02,247;their mother Catelyn Stark.
533;00:33:02,298;00:33:04,516;I swore to her I’d bring
533;00:33:02,298;00:33:04,516;her daughters home.
534;00:33:08,921;00:33:11,473;Sure I can’t get you
534;00:33:08,921;00:33:11,473;a bit more kidney pie?
535;00:33:25,604;00:33:26,771;What?
536;00:33:26,773;00:33:28,406;It’s nothing, my lady.
537;00:33:28,441;00:33:31,776;You wouldn’t be screwing your face
537;00:33:28,441;00:33:31,776;up like that if it was nothing.
538;00:33:31,778;00:33:34,279;Don’t want to offend, my lady.
538;00:33:31,778;00:33:34,279;Truly, I don’t.
539;00:33:34,281;00:33:36,114;You’re not interesting
539;00:33:34,281;00:33:36,114;enough to be offensive.
540;00:33:37,917;00:33:40,201;The Lannisters want Lady Sansa.
541;00:33:40,252;00:33:42,921;The Lannisters have money.
542;00:33:42,955;00:33:44,756;People kill for money.
543;00:33:45,958;00:33:47,842;I don’t think we should
543;00:33:45,958;00:33:47,842;be telling people
544;00:33:47,877;00:33:49,461;we’re searching for Lady Sansa.
545;00:33:59,221;00:34:02,140;My lady. My lord.
545;00:33:59,221;00:34:02,140;Could I have a word?
546;00:34:02,191;00:34:04,142;What about?
546;00:34:02,191;00:34:04,142;Not kidney pie.
547;00:34:04,144;00:34:05,727;You seem like a proper lady.
548;00:34:05,778;00:34:08,196;Someone who could be trusted.
549;00:34:10,199;00:34:12,317;I never met no Sansa Stark.
550;00:34:12,368;00:34:14,452;But I know her sister…
551;00:34:14,487;00:34:16,321;Arya.
552;00:34:18,457;00:34:22,076;No one’s seen Arya Stark since
552;00:34:18,457;00:34:22,076;her father was beheaded.
553;00:34:22,128;00:34:24,929;She’s presumed dead.
554;00:34:24,964;00:34:26,881;She weren’t when I last
554;00:34:24,964;00:34:26,881;spoke to her.
555;00:34:26,916;00:34:29,300;— When was that? — Heading up north with
555;00:34:26,916;00:34:29,300;the Night’s Watch.
556;00:34:29,335;00:34:30,835;She was all dressed up as a boy.
557;00:34:30,837;00:34:33,671;Like your ladyship,
557;00:34:30,837;00:34:33,671;only without the armor.
558;00:34:33,722;00:34:35,557;Going by the name Arry.
559;00:34:35,591;00:34:37,375;— So what happened to her?
559;00:34:35,591;00:34:37,375;— Well–
560;00:34:37,409;00:34:39,561;The quick version.
561;00:34:39,595;00:34:41,429;The Lannisters took us prisoner.
562;00:34:41,480;00:34:43,314;We escaped.
563;00:34:43,349;00:34:45,517;The Brotherhood took
563;00:34:43,349;00:34:45,517;us prisoner.
564;00:34:45,568;00:34:47,018;They sold me to the innkeep.
565;00:34:47,069;00:34:49,654;They were gonna sell Arya
565;00:34:47,069;00:34:49,654;to her mother at Riverrun
566;00:34:49,688;00:34:50,989;along with another prisoner.
567;00:34:51,023;00:34:52,907;Big ugly fellow.
567;00:34:51,023;00:34:52,907;Foul mouth
568;00:34:52,942;00:34:54,943;and a face like
568;00:34:52,942;00:34:54,943;a half-burnt ham.
569;00:34:54,994;00:34:56,911;—  Not friendly.
569;00:34:54,994;00:34:56,911;— The Hound.
570;00:34:56,946;00:34:58,696;That’s the one.
571;00:34:58,747;00:35:02,033;If you find her,
571;00:34:58,747;00:35:02,033;could you give her this?
572;00:35:02,084;00:35:03,868;She liked the last one
572;00:35:02,084;00:35:03,868;I gave her,
573;00:35:03,919;00:35:06,254;but, well, this one
573;00:35:03,919;00:35:06,254;turned out better.
574;00:35:15,848;00:35:18,550;Um, you were saying?
575;00:35:22,605;00:35:25,306;Brienne: — Her mother’s
575;00:35:22,605;00:35:25,306;dead, grandfather’s dead,
576;00:35:25,357;00:35:27,725;Walder Frey is
576;00:35:25,357;00:35:27,725;the new lord of Riverrun.
577;00:35:27,727;00:35:29,611;The Brotherhood
577;00:35:27,727;00:35:29,611;isn’t going to Riverrun.
578;00:35:29,645;00:35:31,563;They’ll take her
578;00:35:29,645;00:35:31,563;to the Eyrie, my lady.
579;00:35:31,614;00:35:33,398;Why the Eyrie?
580;00:35:33,449;00:35:35,900;Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.
581;00:35:35,951;00:35:38,036;Catelyn Stark’s sister.
582;00:35:38,070;00:35:41,072;She’s Arya’s last living
582;00:35:38,070;00:35:41,072;relative with money.
583;00:35:41,123;00:35:43,875;She hates the Lannisters.
584;00:35:45,961;00:35:48,162;Lord Tyrion made sure I knew
585;00:35:48,214;00:35:51,299;which house married which
585;00:35:48,214;00:35:51,299;and who hated who.
586;00:35:51,333;00:35:53,051;Sansa could be there, too.
587;00:35:53,085;00:35:55,553;Aye, my lady.
588;00:35:55,588;00:35:57,255;Could be.
589;00:36:03,679;00:36:05,597;You sure about this?
590;00:36:08,901;00:36:10,485;No.
591;00:36:25,317;00:36:27,852;(door opens)
592;00:36:41,550;00:36:44,435;I imagined you’d be back
592;00:36:41,550;00:36:44,435;at the brothel at this hour.
593;00:36:44,470;00:36:49,190;I did spend some time with an absolutely
593;00:36:44,470;00:36:49,190;stunning blonde the other day.
594;00:36:49,224;00:36:52,043;Mm, do tell.
595;00:36:52,077;00:36:55,480;I’ve got every kind
595;00:36:52,077;00:36:55,480;of filth down here
596;00:36:55,482;00:36:57,031;except the kind I like.
597;00:36:57,066;00:36:59,067;Your sister.
598;00:36:59,118;00:37:01,319;Oh.
599;00:37:07,159;00:37:09,911;Cersei approached me.
600;00:37:11,213;00:37:13,264;We spoke a great deal
600;00:37:11,213;00:37:13,264;about her daughter.
601;00:37:13,299;00:37:16,384;How worried your sister
601;00:37:13,299;00:37:16,384;is about her.
602;00:37:16,418;00:37:19,337;She was trying
602;00:37:16,418;00:37:19,337;very hard to pretend
603;00:37:19,371;00:37:21,372;she had not come
603;00:37:19,371;00:37:21,372;to sway me against you.
604;00:37:21,407;00:37:23,675;I think she may have even
604;00:37:21,407;00:37:23,675;believed it herself.
605;00:37:23,726;00:37:26,761;Making honest feelings
605;00:37:23,726;00:37:26,761;do dishonest work
606;00:37:26,812;00:37:29,230;is one of her many gifts.
607;00:37:29,264;00:37:32,266;It was difficult for her
607;00:37:29,264;00:37:32,266;to hide her true intentions.
608;00:37:33,435;00:37:37,071;It is rare to meet a Lannister
609;00:37:37,106;00:37:41,109;who shares my enthusiasm
609;00:37:37,106;00:37:41,109;for dead Lannisters.
610;00:37:43,579;00:37:45,697;She desperately wants
610;00:37:43,579;00:37:45,697;to see you killed.
611;00:37:45,699;00:37:47,915;She didn’t need to bother you.
612;00:37:47,950;00:37:51,753;It looks as though I’ve
612;00:37:47,950;00:37:51,753;taken care of that myself.
613;00:37:51,787;00:37:54,372;The joy she will feel
614;00:37:54,374;00:37:56,958;when my head leaves my neck.
615;00:37:57,042;00:38:00,244;She’s wanted this
615;00:37:57,042;00:38:00,244;for a long time.
616;00:38:00,279;00:38:03,047;Yes, I know.
617;00:38:03,098;00:38:06,100;We met, you and I.
618;00:38:06,135;00:38:07,719;Many years ago.
619;00:38:07,770;00:38:10,722;I think I would
619;00:38:07,770;00:38:10,722;have remembered that.
620;00:38:10,724;00:38:14,058;Unlikely.
620;00:38:10,724;00:38:14,058;You had just been born.
621;00:38:16,562;00:38:19,030;Our father brought me
621;00:38:16,562;00:38:19,030;and my sister Elia with him
622;00:38:19,064;00:38:20,732;on a visit to Casterly Rock.
623;00:38:20,783;00:38:22,734;My first time away from Dorne.
624;00:38:22,785;00:38:25,153;I didn’t like anything
624;00:38:22,785;00:38:25,153;about the Rock.
625;00:38:26,705;00:38:29,123;Not the food, not the weather,
626;00:38:29,158;00:38:30,825;not your accents.
627;00:38:30,876;00:38:32,493;Nothing.
628;00:38:33,912;00:38:36,414;But the biggest
628;00:38:33,912;00:38:36,414;disappointment…
629;00:38:36,465;00:38:38,750;you.
630;00:38:40,586;00:38:43,588;You and my family have more in
630;00:38:40,586;00:38:43,588;common than you might admit.
631;00:38:43,590;00:38:45,807;The whole way from Dorne
632;00:38:45,841;00:38:48,676;all anyone talked about
632;00:38:45,841;00:38:48,676;was the monster
633;00:38:48,727;00:38:51,679;that had been born
633;00:38:48,727;00:38:51,679;to Tywin Lannister.
634;00:38:51,730;00:38:54,599;A head twice
634;00:38:51,730;00:38:54,599;the size of his body,
635;00:38:54,601;00:38:56,517;a tail between his legs,
636;00:38:56,568;00:38:58,653;claws, one red eye,
637;00:38:58,687;00:39:01,606;the privates of both
637;00:38:58,687;00:39:01,606;a girl and a boy.
638;00:39:01,608;00:39:03,574;That would have made
638;00:39:01,608;00:39:03,574;things so much easier.
639;00:39:03,609;00:39:07,445;When we met your sister, she
639;00:39:03,609;00:39:07,445;promised she would show you to us.
640;00:39:07,496;00:39:09,113;Every day we would ask.
641;00:39:09,164;00:39:11,616;Every day she would
641;00:39:09,164;00:39:11,616;say, «Soon.»
642;00:39:11,618;00:39:14,952;Then she and your brother
643;00:39:14,954;00:39:18,339;took us to your nursery and…
644;00:39:19,792;00:39:22,710;she unveiled the freak.
645;00:39:24,930;00:39:26,764;Your head was a bit large.
646;00:39:26,799;00:39:28,699;Your arms and legs
646;00:39:26,799;00:39:28,699;were a bit small,
647;00:39:28,734;00:39:30,384;but no claw.
648;00:39:30,436;00:39:33,721;No red eye.
648;00:39:30,436;00:39:33,721;No tail between your legs.
649;00:39:33,772;00:39:36,140;Just a tiny pink cock.
650;00:39:36,142;00:39:38,943;We didn’t try to hide
650;00:39:36,142;00:39:38,943;our disappointment.
651;00:39:39,011;00:39:41,395;«That’s not a monster,»
651;00:39:39,011;00:39:41,395;I told Cersei.
652;00:39:41,447;00:39:44,449;«That’s just a baby.»
653;00:39:45,951;00:39:48,569;And she said,
653;00:39:45,951;00:39:48,569;«He killed my mother.»
654;00:39:48,620;00:39:51,122;And she pinched
654;00:39:48,620;00:39:51,122;your little cock so hard,
655;00:39:51,156;00:39:53,157;I thought she might pull it off.
656;00:39:53,159;00:39:55,293;Until your brother
656;00:39:53,159;00:39:55,293;made her stop.
657;00:39:55,327;00:39:57,395;«It doesn’t matter,»
657;00:39:55,327;00:39:57,395;she told us.
658;00:39:57,429;00:40:00,381;«Everyone says he will die soon.
659;00:40:00,415;00:40:02,049;I hope they are right.
660;00:40:02,084;00:40:04,752;He should not
660;00:40:02,084;00:40:04,752;have lived this long.»
661;00:40:08,307;00:40:09,974;Well…
662;00:40:12,561;00:40:17,231;sooner or later, Cersei
662;00:40:12,561;00:40:17,231;always gets what she wants.
663;00:40:19,318;00:40:22,286;And what about what I want?
664;00:40:24,623;00:40:26,858;Justice
665;00:40:26,860;00:40:30,495;for my sister and her children.
666;00:40:30,529;00:40:32,530;If you want justice,
667;00:40:32,532;00:40:35,449;you’ve come to the wrong place.
668;00:40:35,501;00:40:37,702;I disagree.
669;00:40:45,210;00:40:48,262;I’ve come to the perfect place.
670;00:40:50,015;00:40:52,350;I want to bring those who
670;00:40:50,015;00:40:52,350;have wronged me to justice.
671;00:40:52,384;00:40:55,469;And all those who have
671;00:40:52,384;00:40:55,469;wronged me are right here.
672;00:40:57,806;00:41:00,024;I will begin with
672;00:40:57,806;00:41:00,024;Ser Gregor Clegane,
673;00:41:00,058;00:41:02,810;who killed my sister’s children
674;00:41:02,861;00:41:06,230;and then raped her with their
674;00:41:02,861;00:41:06,230;blood still on his hands
675;00:41:06,232;00:41:08,983;before killing her, too.
676;00:41:17,492;00:41:19,744;I will be your champion.
677;00:41:20,746;00:41:23,548;(exhales)
678;00:42:13,932;00:42:15,800;Hello, Robin.
679;00:42:18,387;00:42:19,720;What are you doing?
680;00:42:19,771;00:42:21,689;I’m building my home,
680;00:42:19,771;00:42:21,689;Winterfell.
681;00:42:21,723;00:42:23,774;At least I think I am.
682;00:42:23,809;00:42:26,477;I haven’t been back there
682;00:42:23,809;00:42:26,477;in a very long time.
683;00:42:26,479;00:42:28,863;Why did you leave?
684;00:42:28,897;00:42:31,282;It’s a long story.
685;00:42:32,951;00:42:34,485;I stay here in the Eyrie.
686;00:42:34,536;00:42:37,305;Mother says it’s dangerous on the
686;00:42:34,536;00:42:37,305;roads and I have to keep myself safe
687;00:42:37,339;00:42:38,973;because I’m the Lord of the Vale
688;00:42:39,007;00:42:41,325;and the Lord of the Vale
688;00:42:39,007;00:42:41,325;is a very important person.
689;00:42:41,327;00:42:43,661;Yes, you certainly are.
690;00:42:43,663;00:42:45,930;When will you go back?
691;00:42:45,964;00:42:48,666;Probably never.
692;00:42:48,668;00:42:50,801;My family doesn’t
692;00:42:48,668;00:42:50,801;live there anymore
693;00:42:50,836;00:42:53,304;and someone burned it down.
694;00:42:54,506;00:42:56,173;Oh.
695;00:42:56,175;00:42:58,976;Does Winterfell
695;00:42:56,175;00:42:58,976;have a Moon Door?
696;00:42:59,011;00:43:00,778;No, I’m afraid not.
697;00:43:00,812;00:43:02,930;It’s not high up in the mountains.
697;00:43:00,812;00:43:02,930;It’s down on the ground.
698;00:43:02,981;00:43:04,815;— That sounds dangerous.
698;00:43:02,981;00:43:04,815;— (chuckles)
699;00:43:04,850;00:43:07,652;— How do you make people fly?
699;00:43:04,850;00:43:07,652;— We don’t.
700;00:43:07,686;00:43:09,070;What do you do with
700;00:43:07,686;00:43:09,070;all the bad people
701;00:43:09,104;00:43:11,572;and the scary people
701;00:43:09,104;00:43:11,572;and the people you don’t like?
702;00:43:11,606;00:43:13,157;I never did anything
702;00:43:11,606;00:43:13,157;with them at all.
703;00:43:13,191;00:43:15,826;Girls didn’t take part
703;00:43:13,191;00:43:15,826;in that where I came from.
704;00:43:15,861;00:43:19,163;Well, I’m Lord of the Vale.
705;00:43:19,197;00:43:22,500;When I grow up, I’ll be able
705;00:43:19,197;00:43:22,500;to fly anybody who bothers me.

710;00:43:32,544;00:43:34,462;I like the sound of that.
