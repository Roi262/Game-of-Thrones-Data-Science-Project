2;00:03:32,872;00:03:35,953;Summoned to court to answer for
2;00:03:32,872;00:03:35,953;the crime of your bannerman,
3;00:03:35,954;00:03:37,834;Gregor Clegane, The Mountain.
4;00:03:39,184;00:03:43,287;Arrive within a fortnight
4;00:03:39,184;00:03:43,287;or be branded an enemy of the crown.
5;00:03:45,261;00:03:49,250;Poor Ned Stark. Brave man,
5;00:03:45,261;00:03:49,250;terrible judgment.
6;00:03:53,829;00:03:56,025;Attacking him was stupid.
7;00:04:04,451;00:04:05,914;Lannister...
8;00:04:06,950;00:04:08,912;don't act like fools.
9;00:04:14,639;00:04:17,177;You're gonna say
9;00:04:14,639;00:04:17,177;something clever?
10;00:04:18,265;00:04:20,326;Go on, say something clever.
11;00:04:23,764;00:04:25,876;Catelyn Stark took my brother.
12;00:04:29,828;00:04:31,440;Why is he still alive?
13;00:04:31,579;00:04:32,664;Tyrion?
14;00:04:32,830;00:04:34,226;Ned Stark.
15;00:04:35,455;00:04:37,366;One of our men interfered...
16;00:04:37,467;00:04:40,777;speared him through the leg,
16;00:04:37,467;00:04:40,777;before I could finish him.
17;00:04:41,452;00:04:43,337;Why is he still alive?
18;00:04:44,516;00:04:46,630;It wouldn't have been clean.
19;00:04:46,789;00:04:47,953;Clean?
20;00:04:49,642;00:04:53,429;You spent too much time
20;00:04:49,642;00:04:53,429;worrying about what other people think of you.
21;00:04:53,480;00:04:55,828;I could care less what
21;00:04:53,480;00:04:55,828;what anyone thinks of me.
22;00:04:55,866;00:04:58,601;That's what you want people
22;00:04:55,866;00:04:58,601;to think of you.
23;00:04:58,641;00:05:00,054;It's the truth.
24;00:05:01,456;00:05:06,129;And you hear them whispering Kingslayer
24;00:05:01,456;00:05:06,129;behind your back, doesn't it bother you?
25;00:05:08,267;00:05:10,477;Of course it bothers me.
26;00:05:10,830;00:05:14,667;A lion doesn't concern himself
26;00:05:10,830;00:05:14,667;with the opinion of a sheep.
27;00:05:17,604;00:05:19,955;I suppose I should be grateful
27;00:05:17,604;00:05:19,955;that your vanity,
28;00:05:19,956;00:05:22,606;got in a way of your recklessness.
29;00:05:24,579;00:05:28,480;I'm giving you half of our forces.
29;00:05:24,579;00:05:28,480;30.000 men.
30;00:05:29,328;00:05:32,422;And we'll bring that to
30;00:05:29,328;00:05:32,422;Catelyn Stark girlhood home...
31;00:05:32,639;00:05:36,542;and remind her that Lannisters
31;00:05:32,639;00:05:36,542;pay their debts
32;00:05:38,078;00:05:41,656;I didn't realize you place such
32;00:05:38,078;00:05:41,656;a high value on my brother's life.
33;00:05:41,705;00:05:43,227;He's a Lannister.
34;00:05:43,956;00:05:47,278;Maybe the lowest of the Lannister,
34;00:05:43,956;00:05:47,278;but he's one of us.
35;00:05:47,467;00:05:49,842;And every day that he remains a prisoner,
36;00:05:49,964;00:05:52,606;the less our name command respect.
37;00:05:52,952;00:05:57,478;So the lion does concern himself with the opinion...
37;00:05:52,952;00:05:57,478;No, that's not an opinion, it's a fact.
38;00:06:00,016;00:06:02,509;If another house can seize
38;00:06:00,016;00:06:02,509;one of our own
39;00:06:02,544;00:06:04,856;and hold him captive, with impunity...
40;00:06:05,357;00:06:07,992;we are no longer house to be feared.
41;00:06:12,268;00:06:13,541;Your mother is dead.
42;00:06:14,454;00:06:16,528;Before long I'll be dead.
43;00:06:16,563;00:06:17,728;and you...
44;00:06:18,266;00:06:19,290;and your brother...
45;00:06:19,578;00:06:22,167;and your sister and all of her children...
46;00:06:22,208;00:06:26,419;all of us dead,
46;00:06:22,208;00:06:26,419;all of us rotting underground.
47;00:06:27,455;00:06:30,104;Is the family name
47;00:06:27,455;00:06:30,104;that lives on.
48;00:06:30,208;00:06:32,341;It's all that lives on.
49;00:06:32,833;00:06:37,233;Not your personal glory
49;00:06:32,833;00:06:37,233;not your honor... but family.
50;00:06:38,644;00:06:40,591;You understand?
51;00:06:52,395;00:06:55,994;You're blessed with ability
51;00:06:52,395;00:06:55,994;that few men possess.
52;00:06:56,079;00:07:00,009;You're blessed you belong to
52;00:06:56,079;00:07:00,009;the most powerful family in the kingdom.
53;00:07:00,329;00:07:02,819;And you still blessed
53;00:07:00,329;00:07:02,819;with youth.
54;00:07:03,393;00:07:05,893;And what you've done
54;00:07:03,393;00:07:05,893;with this blessing?
55;00:07:07,082;00:07:10,708;You served as the glorified bodyguard
55;00:07:07,082;00:07:10,708;for two kings...
56;00:07:10,709;00:07:13,731;one a mad man, the other a drunk.
57;00:07:19,083;00:07:22,959;The future of our family will be
57;00:07:19,083;00:07:22,959;determined in these next few months.
58;00:07:22,960;00:07:26,546;We could established a dynasty
58;00:07:22,960;00:07:26,546;that would last a thousand years...
59;00:07:27,020;00:07:30,680;or we could collapse into nothing.
59;00:07:27,020;00:07:30,680;As the Targaryens did.
60;00:07:33,643;00:07:37,681;I need you to become a man
60;00:07:33,643;00:07:37,681;you're always meant to be.
61;00:07:38,252;00:07:40,627;Not next year, not tomorrow...
62;00:07:41,601;00:07:42,877;Now.
63;00:08:12,590;00:08:13,678;You're in pain.
64;00:08:20,092;00:08:21,978;I've had worse, my lady.
65;00:08:23,152;00:08:25,065;Perhaps it's time to go home.
66;00:08:25,529;00:08:27,466;The south doesn't seem to agree with you...
67;00:08:27,467;00:08:30,041;I know the truth Jon Arryn died for...
68;00:08:31,089;00:08:32,817;Do you, lord Stark?
69;00:08:33,779;00:08:37,238;Is that why you called me here?
69;00:08:33,779;00:08:37,238;To pose me riddles?
70;00:08:38,101;00:08:39,673;Has he done this before?
71;00:08:41,442;00:08:42,979;Jaime would've killed him.
72;00:08:44,279;00:08:46,690;My brother's worth
72;00:08:44,279;00:08:46,690;a thousand of your friend.
73;00:08:46,691;00:08:47,778;Your brother...
74;00:08:48,440;00:08:49,591;or your lover?
75;00:08:54,754;00:08:57,913;Targaryens wed brothers and sisters
75;00:08:54,754;00:08:57,913;for 300 years...
76;00:08:57,914;00:08:59,591;to keep bloodlines pure.
77;00:09:00,067;00:09:02,355;Jaime and I are more than
77;00:09:00,067;00:09:02,355;brother and sister.
78;00:09:02,379;00:09:04,441;We shared a womb.
79;00:09:04,442;00:09:07,444;Came to this world together,
79;00:09:04,442;00:09:07,444;we belong together.
80;00:09:08,192;00:09:10,156;My son saw you with him.
81;00:09:17,067;00:09:19,157;Do you love your children?
81;00:09:17,067;00:09:19,157;With all my heart.
82;00:09:19,192;00:09:22,335;No more than I love mine.
82;00:09:19,192;00:09:22,335;And they're all Jaime's.
83;00:09:22,395;00:09:23,609;Thank the Gods.
84;00:09:23,610;00:09:27,126;In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores
84;00:09:23,610;00:09:27,126;for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed,
85;00:09:27,127;00:09:28,950;I finished him off another ways
86;00:09:28,951;00:09:32,193;In the morning he doesn't remember.
86;00:09:28,951;00:09:32,193;You've always hated him.
87;00:09:32,343;00:09:33,549;Hated him?
88;00:09:34,098;00:09:35,567;I worshipped him.
89;00:09:35,720;00:09:39,706;Every girl in the southern kingdom
89;00:09:35,720;00:09:39,706;dreamt of him but he was mine by oath.
90;00:09:40,094;00:09:43,930;And when I finally saw him on our wedding day
90;00:09:40,094;00:09:43,930;in the Sept of Baelor.
91;00:09:44,031;00:09:48,556;lean and fierce, and black-bearded
91;00:09:44,031;00:09:48,556;it was the happiest moment of my life.
92;00:09:49,906;00:09:52,280;And that night he crawl on top of me,
92;00:09:49,906;00:09:52,280;stinking of wine
93;00:09:52,315;00:09:55,399;and did what he did what little he could do
94;00:09:57,182;00:09:59,492;and whispered in my ear: Lyanna.
95;00:10:01,530;00:10:04,240;Your sister was a corpse
95;00:10:01,530;00:10:04,240;and I was a living girl
96;00:10:04,241;00:10:06,032;and he loved her more than me.
97;00:10:08,345;00:10:11,530;When the king return from his hunts,
97;00:10:08,345;00:10:11,530;I'll tell him the truth.
98;00:10:11,531;00:10:14,657;You must be gone by then...
98;00:10:11,531;00:10:14,657;you and your children.
99;00:10:14,777;00:10:17,220;I will not have that blood on my hands.
100;00:10:17,513;00:10:19,488;Go as far away as you can...
101;00:10:20,075;00:10:22,312;With as many men as you can.
102;00:10:22,717;00:10:24,163;Because wherever you go...
103;00:10:24,951;00:10:26,914;Robert's wrath will follow you.
104;00:10:27,512;00:10:29,426;And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?
105;00:10:30,139;00:10:32,300;You should have taken the realm
105;00:10:30,139;00:10:32,300;for yourself.
106;00:10:32,515;00:10:35,589;Jaime told me about the day
106;00:10:32,515;00:10:35,589;King's Landing fell.
107;00:10:35,639;00:10:38,351;He was sitting in the Iron Throne
107;00:10:35,639;00:10:38,351;and you made him give it up.
108;00:10:38,450;00:10:42,840;All you needed to do is climb the steps
108;00:10:38,450;00:10:42,840;yourself. Such a sad mistake.
109;00:10:43,505;00:10:46,217;I've made many mistakes in my life,
110;00:10:47,253;00:10:49,042;but that wasn't one of them.
111;00:10:49,066;00:10:50,442;Oh, but it was.
112;00:10:51,629;00:10:55,230;When you play the game of thrones,
112;00:10:51,629;00:10:55,230;you win or you die.
113;00:10:56,315;00:10:57,843;There is no middle ground.
114;00:11:45,942;00:11:48,766;No, No, No, No...
115;00:11:50,218;00:11:52,634;is that what they teach you
115;00:11:50,218;00:11:52,634;up in the North?
116;00:11:54,156;00:11:57,119;And you, wherever you're from.
117;00:11:58,093;00:12:01,744;Do you have any idea
117;00:11:58,093;00:12:01,744;how ridiculous you sound?
118;00:12:02,032;00:12:05,244;Either of you understand the thing that I'm saying?
119;00:12:06,219;00:12:07,496;Yes, my lord.
120;00:12:08,344;00:12:10,869;Let's start over. Shall we?
121;00:12:11,967;00:12:15,558;You be the man, and you be the woman.
122;00:12:20,594;00:12:21,908;Go ahead.
123;00:12:24,468;00:12:25,844;Slowly.
124;00:12:35,032;00:12:39,932;You're not fooling them,
124;00:12:35,032;00:12:39,932;they just paid you, they know what you are.
125;00:12:40,469;00:12:42,684;They know it's all just an act
126;00:12:42,781;00:12:45,744;Your job is to make them
126;00:12:42,781;00:12:45,744;forget what they know.
127;00:12:46,044;00:12:47,493;And that takes time.
128;00:12:48,533;00:12:49,850;You need to...
129;00:12:50,388;00:12:52,746;ease into it.
130;00:12:55,094;00:12:56,370;Go ahead.
131;00:12:57,471;00:13:00,058;Ease into it.
132;00:13:09,032;00:13:12,121;He's winding you over,
132;00:13:09,032;00:13:12,121;in spite of yourself.
133;00:13:12,221;00:13:14,434;You're starting to like this.
134;00:13:15,533;00:13:17,005;He wants to believe you.
135;00:13:17,094;00:13:19,673;He's enjoyed his cock since he was old enough
136;00:13:19,674;00:13:21,058;to play with a boy, shouldn't you?
137;00:13:21,160;00:13:24,531;He knows, he's better than other men.
138;00:13:24,532;00:13:28,245;He's always known it deep down inside
138;00:13:24,532;00:13:28,245;now he has proof.
139;00:13:28,735;00:13:29,822;He's so good...
140;00:13:30,823;00:13:35,309;he's reaching something deep inside of you
140;00:13:30,823;00:13:35,309;that no one even knew was there.
141;00:13:35,597;00:13:38,247;Overcoming your very nature...
142;00:13:40,348;00:13:42,636;Why don't you join us, my lord?
143;00:13:43,908;00:13:46,134;I'm saving myself for another.
144;00:13:46,996;00:13:48,843;What she doesn't know
144;00:13:46,996;00:13:48,843;will not hurt her?
145;00:13:48,844;00:13:50,323;A stupid saying...
146;00:13:51,095;00:13:54,734;What we don't know is usually
146;00:13:51,095;00:13:54,734;what get us killed.
147;00:13:55,722;00:13:57,434;She must be very beautiful.
148;00:13:57,473;00:14:01,398;No, not really.
148;00:13:57,473;00:14:01,398;Impeccable bloodlines, though.
149;00:14:01,471;00:14:03,371;I do believe my lord in love.
150;00:14:03,409;00:14:06,634;For many years.
150;00:14:03,409;00:14:06,634;Most of my life really.
151;00:14:07,100;00:14:08,600;Play with her ass.
152;00:14:08,701;00:14:10,401;And she loved me too.
153;00:14:11,202;00:14:13,202;I was her little confidant.
154;00:14:14,203;00:14:18,003;A play thing. She could tell me anything,
154;00:14:14,203;00:14:18,003;anything at all.
155;00:14:18,404;00:14:22,604;She told me about
155;00:14:18,404;00:14:22,604;all the horses that she liked.
156;00:14:22,605;00:14:27,005;The castle that she want to live in.
156;00:14:22,605;00:14:27,005;The man that she wanted to marry.
157;00:14:27,707;00:14:29,207;A northerner...
158;00:14:29,608;00:14:31,608;with a jaw like an anvil.
159;00:14:32,408;00:14:36,908;So I challenged him to a duel. I mean,
159;00:14:32,408;00:14:36,908;why not? I'd read all the stories.
160;00:14:37,309;00:14:41,500;The little hero always beats
160;00:14:37,309;00:14:41,500;the big villain in all the stories.
161;00:14:41,592;00:14:45,400;In the end...
161;00:14:41,592;00:14:45,400;she wouldn't even let him kill me.
162;00:14:45,601;00:14:48,101;He's just a boy, she said.
163;00:14:48,402;00:14:50,202;Please don't hurt him.
164;00:14:50,903;00:14:55,203;So he gave me a nice little scar to remember
164;00:14:50,903;00:14:55,203;and by enough they went
165;00:14:55,204;00:14:57,704;And she still married to him?
165;00:14:55,204;00:14:57,704;Oh, no.
166;00:14:57,905;00:15:00,605;He got himself killed before the wedding.
167;00:15:01,906;00:15:06,006;And she ended up with his brother,
167;00:15:01,906;00:15:06,006;an even more impressive specimen.
168;00:15:06,307;00:15:08,607;She loves him, I'm afraid.
169;00:15:08,908;00:15:10,508;And why wouldn't she, I mean?
170;00:15:10,608;00:15:14,008;Who could compare to him,
170;00:15:10,608;00:15:14,008;he just so...
171;00:15:20,603;00:15:21,703;good.
172;00:15:24,304;00:15:27,204;Do you know what I learned
172;00:15:24,304;00:15:27,204;losing that duel?
173;00:15:27,705;00:15:29,605;I learned that I'll never win.
174;00:15:30,006;00:15:32,906;Not that way.
174;00:15:30,006;00:15:32,906;That's their game.
175;00:15:33,507;00:15:35,007;Their rules.
176;00:15:35,908;00:15:37,808;I'm not going to fight them.
177;00:15:38,109;00:15:39,409;I'm going to fuck them.
178;00:15:40,110;00:15:43,110;That's what I know, that's what I am.
179;00:15:43,611;00:15:47,211;And only by admitting what we are,
179;00:15:43,611;00:15:47,211;can we get what we want.
180;00:15:48,212;00:15:49,612;And what do you want?
181;00:15:50,513;00:15:53,113;Oh, everything, my dear.
182;00:15:53,714;00:15:55,314;Everything there is.
183;00:15:58,615;00:16:01,815;Now wash yourself,
183;00:15:58,615;00:16:01,815;both of you are working tonight.
184;00:16:32,524;00:16:34,851;You're very lucky girl,
184;00:16:32,524;00:16:34,851;do you know that?
185;00:16:38,459;00:16:41,570;Where I come from we don't show mercy
185;00:16:38,459;00:16:41,570;to criminals.
186;00:16:41,738;00:16:45,332;Where I come from,
186;00:16:41,738;00:16:45,332;if someone like you attacked a little lord...
187;00:16:45,759;00:16:48,992;the low tide will lay you on your back,
187;00:16:45,759;00:16:48,992;on the beach...
188;00:16:49,161;00:16:51,732;your hands and feet chained to four stakes...
189;00:16:52,206;00:16:54,712;sea will coming closer and closer.
190;00:16:55,234;00:16:59,222;You'll see death creeping toward you,
190;00:16:55,234;00:16:59,222;a few inches at a time.
191;00:17:00,622;00:17:01,985;Where do you come from?
192;00:17:02,615;00:17:04,061;The Iron Islands.
193;00:17:04,833;00:17:06,099;They far away?
194;00:17:06,505;00:17:08,429;You've never heard of the Iron Islands?
195;00:17:08,464;00:17:12,281;Trust me, you've never heard
195;00:17:08,464;00:17:12,281;where I'm from neither.
196;00:17:13,349;00:17:15,509;Trust me, my lord.
197;00:17:18,471;00:17:20,696;You're not living in the wilderness anymore.
198;00:17:20,872;00:17:24,836;In civilized land, you advert
198;00:17:20,872;00:17:24,836;your betters by their proper titles.
199;00:17:25,432;00:17:26,672;And what's that?
200;00:17:27,092;00:17:28,172;Lord.
201;00:17:28,655;00:17:29,783;Why?
202;00:17:31,082;00:17:32,074;Why?
203;00:17:32,868;00:17:34,643;What do you mean why?
204;00:17:34,859;00:17:37,986;My father is Balon Greyjoy,
204;00:17:34,859;00:17:37,986;Lord of the Iron Islands.
205;00:17:38,061;00:17:39,955;What's that got to do with you?
206;00:17:41,175;00:17:45,111;If your father's lord,
206;00:17:41,175;00:17:45,111;how can you be lord too?
207;00:17:45,802;00:17:49,353;I will be lord after my father...
207;00:17:45,802;00:17:49,353;So you're not lord now.
208;00:17:49,372;00:17:50,469;No, you...
209;00:17:52,786;00:17:54,596;You having a go at me?
210;00:17:54,795;00:17:55,795;Is that it?
211;00:17:56,472;00:17:59,324;Just don't understand
211;00:17:56,472;00:17:59,324;how you southerners do things.
212;00:17:59,351;00:18:00,654;I'm not a southerner.
213;00:18:00,710;00:18:02,906;You're from south of The Wall...
214;00:18:03,507;00:18:05,707;that makes you a southerner to me.
215;00:18:08,033;00:18:10,872;You're an impudent little wench,
215;00:18:08,033;00:18:10,872;aren't you?
216;00:18:11,746;00:18:15,542;Couldn't say, my lord.
216;00:18:11,746;00:18:15,542;Didn't know what impunent means.
217;00:18:15,808;00:18:19,040;Impudent. It means rude.
218;00:18:19,694;00:18:21,011;Disrespectful.
219;00:18:25,239;00:18:27,171;Do you want to lose that chain?
220;00:18:29,712;00:18:31,346;Theon Greyjoy!
221;00:18:32,310;00:18:34,570;The lady is our guest.
222;00:18:34,810;00:18:36,148;Thought she was our prisoner.
223;00:18:36,212;00:18:39,856;Are the two mutually exclusive,
223;00:18:36,212;00:18:39,856;in your experience?
224;00:18:50,420;00:18:53,419;Chances are I won't be nearby
224;00:18:50,420;00:18:53,419;the next time that happens.
225;00:18:53,422;00:18:55,658;I'm used to worse than him.
226;00:18:56,509;00:18:59,410;I'm used to men
226;00:18:56,509;00:18:59,410;could chew that boy up,
227;00:18:59,445;00:19:01,784;and pick their teeth with his bones.
228;00:19:08,109;00:19:09,521;Why did you come here?
229;00:19:09,980;00:19:11,859;Didn't mean to come here.
230;00:19:12,541;00:19:14,579;Meant to get much further
230;00:19:12,541;00:19:14,579;south than this.
231;00:19:15,032;00:19:16,890;As far as south as south goes.
232;00:19:18,035;00:19:20,216;Before the long night comes.
233;00:19:20,727;00:19:21,782;Why?
234;00:19:22,005;00:19:23,381;What do you afraid of?
235;00:19:24,294;00:19:28,392;Those things that sleep in the day
235;00:19:24,294;00:19:28,392;and hunt at night.
236;00:19:28,881;00:19:33,015;Owl and shadowcats--
236;00:19:28,881;00:19:33,015;I'm not talking about owl and shadowcats.
237;00:19:37,171;00:19:39,422;The things you speak of...
238;00:19:40,295;00:19:42,805;have been gone for thousands of years.
239;00:19:42,884;00:19:44,794;It wasn't gone, old man.
240;00:19:46,395;00:19:47,995;They were sleeping.
241;00:19:49,115;00:19:51,581;And they ain't sleeping no more.
242;00:20:00,358;00:20:01,993;I missed girls.
243;00:20:03,154;00:20:05,800;Not even talking to them,
243;00:20:03,154;00:20:05,800;I never talk to them.
244;00:20:07,747;00:20:09,397;Just lookin' at them.
245;00:20:09,618;00:20:11,081;Hearing them giggle.
246;00:20:16,857;00:20:18,574;Don't you miss girls?
247;00:20:23,918;00:20:25,006;Riders!
248;00:20:25,910;00:20:28,739;The horn. We have to blow the horn.
249;00:20:29,754;00:20:30,906;Why is he alone?
250;00:20:33,641;00:20:36,010;One blast for a ranger returning,
251;00:20:36,357;00:20:37,794;two for wildlings,
252;00:20:38,233;00:20:40,644;Three--
252;00:20:38,233;00:20:40,644;He's no rider.
253;00:21:14,849;00:21:16,941;That's my uncle Benjen's horse.
254;00:21:24,409;00:21:25,610;Where's my uncle?
255;00:21:29,941;00:21:30,943;Ned!
256;00:21:33,471;00:21:34,718;Robert...
257;00:21:35,220;00:21:37,721;we are hunting... a boar...
258;00:21:44,721;00:21:47,595;I should have spent more time with you.
259;00:21:48,607;00:21:51,180;Shown to you how to be a man.
260;00:21:54,753;00:21:57,402;I was never meant to be a father.
261;00:22:17,424;00:22:18,432;Go on....
262;00:22:19,607;00:22:21,470;you don't want to see this.
263;00:22:35,855;00:22:37,114;My fault...
264;00:22:37,980;00:22:39,381;Too much wine...
265;00:22:40,002;00:22:42,070;Missed my thrust...
266;00:22:50,981;00:22:52,820;Stinks.
267;00:22:53,769;00:22:55,652;Stinks like death.
268;00:22:56,360;00:22:59,042;Don't think I can't smell it.
269;00:23:02,302;00:23:05,167;Pay the bastard back, Ned.
270;00:23:05,480;00:23:08,056;I drove my knife
270;00:23:05,480;00:23:08,056;right through his brain
271;00:23:08,057;00:23:10,317;You ask him if I didn't. Ask him!
272;00:23:11,886;00:23:16,886;I want the funeral feast to be the biggest
272;00:23:11,886;00:23:16,886;the kingdom ever saw...
273;00:23:17,953;00:23:21,741;And I want everyone
273;00:23:17,953;00:23:21,741;to taste the boar that got me
274;00:23:25,166;00:23:28,594;Now leave us, the lot of you
274;00:23:25,166;00:23:28,594;I need to talk to Ned.
275;00:23:29,329;00:23:32,291;Robert, my sweet...
275;00:23:29,329;00:23:32,291;Out! All of you!
276;00:23:51,972;00:23:53,783;You damn fool.
277;00:23:54,363;00:23:56,400;Paper and ink. On the table.
278;00:23:56,701;00:23:58,301;Write down what I said.
279;00:24:06,307;00:24:09,819;In the name of Robert
279;00:24:06,307;00:24:09,819;of the House Baratheon
280;00:24:10,520;00:24:15,520;First of... you know how it goes.
280;00:24:10,520;00:24:15,520;Put in the damn titles...
281;00:24:16,436;00:24:17,927;I hereby command...
282;00:24:18,328;00:24:23,028;Eddard of House Stark...

285;00:24:32,786;00:24:36,286;until my son Joffrey comes of age.
286;00:24:53,918;00:24:54,974;Give it over...
287;00:25:11,002;00:25:12,567;Give it to the council...
288;00:25:13,068;00:25:14,568;after I'm death.
289;00:25:16,175;00:25:20,729;At least they'll say I did this right, this one thing.
290;00:25:20,926;00:25:22,812;You'll rule now.
291;00:25:23,962;00:25:26,425;You'll hate it worse than I did...
292;00:25:27,365;00:25:28,810;but you'll do it well.
293;00:25:33,297;00:25:34,535;The girl...
294;00:25:35,536;00:25:36,836;Daenerys...
295;00:25:38,937;00:25:40,237;you're right.
296;00:25:40,324;00:25:44,423;Varys, Littlefinger, my brother...
296;00:25:40,324;00:25:44,423;Worthless...

298;00:25:49,777;00:25:50,777;Only you.
299;00:25:55,152;00:25:56,603;Let her live
300;00:25:58,404;00:26:01,604;Stop it if it's not too late.
300;00:25:58,404;00:26:01,604;I will.
301;00:26:02,638;00:26:03,910;My son...
302;00:26:05,511;00:26:07,111;help him, Ned.
303;00:26:08,547;00:26:10,459;Make him better than me
304;00:26:11,509;00:26:12,619;I'll...
305;00:26:14,482;00:26:17,450;I'll do everything I can
305;00:26:14,482;00:26:17,450;to honor your memory.
306;00:26:17,530;00:26:19,216;My memory?
307;00:26:22,449;00:26:25,087;King Robert Baratheon...
308;00:26:25,988;00:26:28,388;murdered by a pig.
309;00:26:31,963;00:26:35,312;Give me something to the pain,
309;00:26:31,963;00:26:35,312;and let me die.
310;00:26:50,074;00:26:51,948;Give him milk of the poppy.
311;00:27:00,168;00:27:02,861;He was reeling from the wine...
312;00:27:04,147;00:27:05,525;He commanded us to...
313;00:27:05,926;00:27:07,626;step aside, but...
314;00:27:08,973;00:27:10,383;I failed him.
315;00:27:13,074;00:27:16,026;No men could've protected him from himself.
316;00:27:17,674;00:27:22,801;I wonder, Ser Barristan,
316;00:27:17,674;00:27:22,801;who gave the King this wine?
317;00:27:23,736;00:27:26,611;His squire.
317;00:27:23,736;00:27:26,611;From the King's own skin.
318;00:27:26,696;00:27:29,625;His squire? The Lannister boy?
319;00:27:29,947;00:27:34,466;Such a dutiful boy to make sure
319;00:27:29,947;00:27:34,466;His Grace did not lack refreshment.
320;00:27:35,148;00:27:38,584;I do hope the poor lad
320;00:27:35,148;00:27:38,584;does not blame himself.
321;00:27:46,575;00:27:50,997;His Grace has had a change of heart
321;00:27:46,575;00:27:50,997;concerning Daenerys Targaryen.
322;00:27:52,450;00:27:55,387;Whatever arrangements you made...
323;00:27:56,231;00:27:59,418;unmade them, at once.
324;00:27:59,505;00:28:02,810;I'm afraid those birds have flown.
325;00:28:03,024;00:28:05,419;The Khaleesi likely dead already.
326;00:29:46,123;00:29:48,351;Can you help me make him...understand?
327;00:29:48,445;00:29:51,186;The Dothraki do things on their own time
327;00:29:48,445;00:29:51,186;for their own reason
328;00:29:51,201;00:29:54,809;Have patience, Khaleesi. We will
328;00:29:51,201;00:29:54,809;go home, I promise you.
329;00:29:54,860;00:29:56,111;My brother...
330;00:29:56,312;00:30:00,312;was a fool, I know.. but he was
330;00:29:56,312;00:30:00,312;the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms.
331;00:30:01,672;00:30:03,292;Have I said something funny, ser?
332;00:30:03,327;00:30:06,316;Forgive me, khaleesi, but your ancestor,
332;00:30:03,327;00:30:06,316;Aegon The Conqueror,
333;00:30:06,317;00:30:09,048;didn't seize six of the kingdoms
333;00:30:06,317;00:30:09,048;because it his right.
334;00:30:09,083;00:30:11,780;He have no right to them,
334;00:30:09,083;00:30:11,780;he seized them because he could.
335;00:30:11,892;00:30:13,588;And because he had dragons.
336;00:30:13,893;00:30:16,495;Having few dragons makes things easier.
337;00:30:17,333;00:30:20,822;You don't believe it?
337;00:30:17,333;00:30:20,822;Have you ever seen a dragon, khaleesi?
338;00:30:21,256;00:30:24,008;I believe what my eyes and ears report.
339;00:30:24,307;00:30:28,556;As for the rest, it was 300 years ago,
339;00:30:24,307;00:30:28,556;who knows what really happened.
340;00:30:28,616;00:30:30,965;Now if you pardon me,
340;00:30:28,616;00:30:30,965;I'll seek out the merchant captain...
341;00:30:30,966;00:30:33,966;see if he has any letter for me.
341;00:30:30,966;00:30:33,966;Well, I'll come with you.
342;00:30:33,984;00:30:35,692;No, no, don't trouble yourself.
343;00:30:35,788;00:30:39,029;Enjoy the market.
343;00:30:35,788;00:30:39,029;I'll rejoin you soon enough.
344;00:30:47,714;00:30:49,441;Jorah, the Andal?
345;00:30:51,653;00:30:55,552;The Spider sent his greetings
345;00:30:51,653;00:30:55,552;and his congratulations.
346;00:30:58,129;00:30:59,665;Overall pardon,
347;00:30:59,918;00:31:01,517;you can go home now.
348;00:31:41,564;00:31:45,953;My son already has his name, but I'll
348;00:31:41,564;00:31:45,953;try your summer wine. Just a taste.
349;00:31:46,875;00:31:49,160;My lady, you are from Westeros?
350;00:31:49,315;00:31:52,976;You have the honor of addressing
350;00:31:49,315;00:31:52,976;Daenerys of the House Targaryen.
351;00:31:53,090;00:31:57,086;Khaleesi of the riding men,
351;00:31:53,090;00:31:57,086;and princess of the Seven Kingdoms.
352;00:31:57,576;00:31:59,599;Princess.
352;00:31:57,576;00:31:59,599;Rise.
353;00:32:00,188;00:32:02,076;I still like to taste that wine.
354;00:32:02,654;00:32:03,713;That?
355;00:32:04,314;00:32:07,714;Dornish swill not worthy of a princess.
356;00:32:07,828;00:32:10,115;I have the dry red from the Arbor.
357;00:32:10,305;00:32:11,850;Nectar of the Gods.
358;00:32:12,281;00:32:14,039;Let me give you a cask.
359;00:32:14,402;00:32:16,866;A gift!
359;00:32:14,402;00:32:16,866;You honor me, ser.
360;00:32:16,877;00:32:19,329;The honor...the honor is all mine.
361;00:32:24,592;00:32:26,296;You know there are many in your homeland
362;00:32:26,297;00:32:27,954;that pray for your return, princess.
363;00:32:27,989;00:32:29,952;I hope to repay your kindness someday.
364;00:32:39,960;00:32:42,231;The wine is for the Khaleesi,
364;00:32:39,960;00:32:42,231;it's not for the likes of you.
365;00:32:42,278;00:32:43,338;Open it.
366;00:32:55,162;00:32:56,161;Pour.
367;00:32:57,055;00:33:00,462;It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich
367;00:32:57,055;00:33:00,462;without at least giving it time to breathe.
368;00:33:00,464;00:33:01,851;Do as he says.
369;00:33:03,254;00:33:04,953;As the princess command.
370;00:33:17,272;00:33:18,765;Sweet, isn't it?
371;00:33:19,815;00:33:21,572;Can you smell the fruit, ser?
372;00:33:22,811;00:33:24,314;Taste it, my lord.
373;00:33:24,902;00:33:28,585;Tell me that is not the finest wine
373;00:33:24,902;00:33:28,585;that has ever touched your tongue.
374;00:33:31,939;00:33:33,205;You first.
375;00:33:35,844;00:33:36,953;Me?
376;00:33:37,580;00:33:40,002;I'm afraid I'm not worthy of the vintage.
377;00:33:40,052;00:33:43,099;Beside, is it a poor wine merchant
377;00:33:40,052;00:33:43,099;who drink up his own wares
378;00:33:43,148;00:33:45,639;You will drink.
379;00:34:17,687;00:34:18,727;Come.
380;00:34:25,964;00:34:28,860;You came to us as outlaws...
381;00:34:29,138;00:34:30,563;poachers...
382;00:34:31,175;00:34:32,198;rapers...
383;00:34:32,450;00:34:34,552;killers, thieves...
384;00:34:34,677;00:34:36,122;You came alone...
385;00:34:36,522;00:34:38,001;in chains...
386;00:34:38,501;00:34:41,584;without friends, or honor.
387;00:34:42,323;00:34:44,111;You came to us rich...
388;00:34:44,588;00:34:46,178;or you came to us poor.
389;00:34:46,673;00:34:50,748;Some of you bear the name
389;00:34:46,673;00:34:50,748;of proud houses...
390;00:34:51,299;00:34:54,290;all those only bastard names,
390;00:34:51,299;00:34:54,290;or no names at all.
391;00:34:54,389;00:34:59,525;It does not matter.
391;00:34:54,389;00:34:59,525;All that, is in the past.
392;00:35:00,045;00:35:01,129;Here...
393;00:35:02,113;00:35:03,577;on the Wall.
394;00:35:04,413;00:35:06,777;we're all one house.
395;00:35:07,949;00:35:09,095;Tonight...
396;00:35:09,806;00:35:11,977;We're allowed to look happy...
397;00:35:12,549;00:35:14,073;you're going to be a ranger.
398;00:35:15,363;00:35:17,372;It's not what you always wanted?
399;00:35:18,050;00:35:19,764;I want to find my uncle.
400;00:35:20,886;00:35:24,187;I know he's alive out there.
400;00:35:20,886;00:35:24,187;I know he is.
401;00:35:25,426;00:35:28,613;I wish I could help you,
401;00:35:25,426;00:35:28,613;but I'm no ranger.
402;00:35:29,328;00:35:31,439;It's the steward's life for me.
403;00:35:32,287;00:35:34,379;You're honored being a steward.
404;00:35:35,260;00:35:36,701;Not much, really.
405;00:35:37,085;00:35:38,627;But those food.
406;00:35:43,985;00:35:46,028;You begin anew.
407;00:35:52,983;00:35:56,674;A man of the Night's Watch.
408;00:35:58,117;00:36:00,808;live his life for the realm.
409;00:36:02,450;00:36:04,062;Not for King
410;00:36:04,492;00:36:05,671;or a Lord...
411;00:36:05,862;00:36:09,523;or the honor of this house or that house.
412;00:36:10,015;00:36:12,566;Not for gold, glory,..
413;00:36:12,702;00:36:14,528;or women's love.
414;00:36:15,446;00:36:16,848;But for the realm...
415;00:36:17,295;00:36:19,526;and all the people in it.
416;00:36:20,363;00:36:24,104;You all learned the words, your vow
417;00:36:24,202;00:36:27,128;Think carefully before you say them.
418;00:36:27,794;00:36:29,915;The penalty for desertion...
419;00:36:30,676;00:36:32,038;is death.
420;00:36:37,710;00:36:39,690;You can take your vows here...
421;00:36:39,919;00:36:41,119;tonight...
422;00:36:41,703;00:36:42,794;at sunset.
423;00:36:44,097;00:36:46,665;Do any of you still keep the old gods?
424;00:36:48,733;00:36:50,238;I do, my lord.
425;00:36:50,642;00:36:54,085;Do you want to take your vows before the heart tree,
425;00:36:50,642;00:36:54,085;as your uncle did?
426;00:36:54,151;00:36:55,212;Yes, my lord.
427;00:36:55,322;00:36:58,270;You'll find the weirwoods,
427;00:36:55,322;00:36:58,270;a mile north of the Wall...
428;00:36:58,362;00:37:00,421;and your old gods too, maybe.
429;00:37:02,173;00:37:03,302;My Lord?
430;00:37:04,172;00:37:05,387;Might I go as well?
431;00:37:05,414;00:37:07,699;Does House Tarly keep the old gods?
432;00:37:07,933;00:37:09,339;No, my lord...
433;00:37:10,085;00:37:12,303;I was name in the light of the Seven...
434;00:37:12,404;00:37:15,104;as my father was
434;00:37:12,404;00:37:15,104;and his father before him.
435;00:37:15,214;00:37:18,840;Why would you forsake,
435;00:37:15,214;00:37:18,840;the Gods of your father and your house?
436;00:37:21,257;00:37:23,887;The Night's Watch is my house now.
437;00:37:23,894;00:37:26,574;The Seven have never answered my prayers...
438;00:37:27,020;00:37:29,061;perhaps the old gods will.
439;00:37:30,586;00:37:31,836;As you wish.
440;00:37:33,214;00:37:36,050;You all been,
440;00:37:33,214;00:37:36,050;assigned an order...
441;00:37:36,322;00:37:38,636;according to our needs...
442;00:37:39,237;00:37:41,337;and your strength.

457;00:38:13,713;00:38:15,270;Halor, to the builders.
458;00:38:15,424;00:38:17,751;Delugo, to the rangers.
459;00:38:18,007;00:38:20,877;May all the Gods preserve you.
460;00:38:26,460;00:38:28,639;Rangers, with me.
461;00:38:29,568;00:38:30,712;Builders!
462;00:38:50,322;00:38:51,411;Samwell...
463;00:38:51,738;00:38:54,737;you will assisst me in the rookery
463;00:38:51,738;00:38:54,737;and the library.
464;00:38:54,992;00:38:55,989;Pyp...
465;00:38:56,135;00:38:59,064;you will report to Bowen Marsh,
465;00:38:56,135;00:38:59,064;in the kitchen.
466;00:38:59,187;00:39:03,229;Luke, report to One Eye Joe in the stable...
467;00:39:03,958;00:39:07,647;Dareon, I'm sending you to the east watch...
468;00:39:07,825;00:39:10,539;present yourself to Borcas when you arrive...
469;00:39:10,697;00:39:14,046;Make no comment about his nose.
470;00:39:15,584;00:39:16,609;Jon Snow...
471;00:39:16,826;00:39:21,026;Lord Commander Mormont has requested you
471;00:39:16,826;00:39:21,026;for his personal steward.
472;00:39:22,670;00:39:24,151;Will I serve the Lord Commander's meal,
473;00:39:24,152;00:39:26,140;and fetch hot water for his bath?
474;00:39:26,175;00:39:27,173;Certainly.
475;00:39:27,374;00:39:29,874;And keep the fire burning in his chambers...
476;00:39:29,875;00:39:32,675;change his sheets
476;00:39:29,875;00:39:32,675;and blankets daily...
477;00:39:32,748;00:39:36,563;and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you.
478;00:39:39,591;00:39:41,124;You take me for a servant?
479;00:39:41,222;00:39:44,145;We took you for a man of the Night's Watch.
480;00:39:44,237;00:39:47,085;But perhaps we were wrong in that.
481;00:39:47,738;00:39:49,013;May I go?
482;00:39:49,360;00:39:50,714;As you wish.
483;00:39:56,436;00:39:58,746;Jon! Wait!
484;00:39:58,875;00:40:02,455;Don't you see what they're doing?
484;00:39:58,875;00:40:02,455;I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all...
485;00:40:02,456;00:40:04,255;he wanted it and he got it.
486;00:40:04,289;00:40:06,519;Stewards are nothing
486;00:40:04,289;00:40:06,519;but maids!
487;00:40:06,520;00:40:09,194;I'm a better swordsman and rider than any of you!
488;00:40:09,293;00:40:10,650;It's not fair!
489;00:40:10,728;00:40:12,296;Fair?
490;00:40:12,813;00:40:14,908;I was singing for a high lord
490;00:40:12,813;00:40:14,908;at Acorn Hall,
491;00:40:14,909;00:40:17,822;when he put his hand in my leg
491;00:40:14,909;00:40:17,822;and he wanted to see my cock.
492;00:40:17,902;00:40:19,393;I pushed him away and he said...
493;00:40:19,428;00:40:21,935;he'd have my hands cut off
493;00:40:19,428;00:40:21,935;for stealing when it's over.
494;00:40:21,936;00:40:23,875;So now I'm here,
494;00:40:21,936;00:40:23,875;at the end of the world,
495;00:40:23,876;00:40:26,825;with no one to sing for
495;00:40:23,876;00:40:26,825;but old men and little shits like you.
496;00:40:26,826;00:40:28,753;I'll never see my family again.
497;00:40:28,754;00:40:32,198;I'll never be inside a woman again.
497;00:40:28,754;00:40:32,198;So don't tell me about fair.
498;00:40:32,199;00:40:34,224;I thought you were caught stealing
498;00:40:32,199;00:40:34,224;a wheel of cheese...
499;00:40:34,225;00:40:36,112;for your starving sister.
500;00:40:36,147;00:40:38,200;Course who's gonna tell a bunch of strangers...
501;00:40:38,201;00:40:40,404;a high lord tried to grab my cock?
502;00:40:42,754;00:40:44,744;Could you sing me a song, Pyp?
503;00:40:44,994;00:40:47,064;I'd like to hear a song.
504;00:40:51,584;00:40:52,864;Now listen to me...
505;00:40:53,323;00:40:56,617;the old man, is the Lord Commander
505;00:40:53,323;00:40:56,617;of The Night's Watch.
506;00:40:56,669;00:41:01,313;You will be with him, day and night,
506;00:40:56,669;00:41:01,313;yes.. you will clean his clothes.
507;00:41:01,314;00:41:03,670;You will also, take his letters...
508;00:41:03,671;00:41:06,944;attend him at meeting,
508;00:41:03,671;00:41:06,944;squire for him at battle.
509;00:41:07,134;00:41:10,503;You'll know everything,
509;00:41:07,134;00:41:10,503;be part of everything.
510;00:41:10,704;00:41:13,154;And he asked for you himself.
511;00:41:13,814;00:41:16,713;He wants to groom you for command.
512;00:41:21,893;00:41:22,990;I just...
513;00:41:24,306;00:41:26,513;I always wanted to be a ranger.
514;00:41:28,722;00:41:30,772;I always wanted to be a wizard.
515;00:41:34,093;00:41:35,383;What?
516;00:41:35,742;00:41:37,252;No, I'm serious.
517;00:41:37,253;00:41:40,063;So you'll stay and say your word with me?
518;00:41:46,513;00:41:47,862;Lord Stark.
519;00:41:48,412;00:41:49,752;A moment?
520;00:41:50,902;00:41:52,542;Alone, if you will.
521;00:42:02,402;00:42:04,542;He named you Protector of The Realm.
522;00:42:06,182;00:42:07,362;He did.
523;00:42:07,881;00:42:09,342;She won't care.
524;00:42:09,422;00:42:12,382;Give me an hour and I'll put
524;00:42:09,422;00:42:12,382;a hundred of swords at your command.
525;00:42:13,152;00:42:16,411;And what should I do with a hundred swords?
525;00:42:13,152;00:42:16,411;Strike!
526;00:42:16,412;00:42:18,921;Tonight, while the castle sleeps.
527;00:42:19,112;00:42:22,391;We must get Joffrey away from his mother
527;00:42:19,112;00:42:22,391;and into our custody.
528;00:42:22,401;00:42:26,331;Protector of The Realm or no,
528;00:42:22,401;00:42:26,331;he who holds the king holds the kingdom.
529;00:42:27,322;00:42:30,620;Every moment you delay
529;00:42:27,322;00:42:30,620;gives Cersei another moment to prepare.
530;00:42:30,621;00:42:33,513;By the time Robert dies,
530;00:42:30,621;00:42:33,513;it would be too late for the both of us.
531;00:42:33,548;00:42:35,161;What about Stannis?
532;00:42:35,221;00:42:39,111;Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei
532;00:42:35,221;00:42:39,111;and delivering him to Stannis?
533;00:42:39,331;00:42:41,700;You have odd notion about
533;00:42:39,331;00:42:41,700;protecting the realm.
534;00:42:41,701;00:42:43,370;Stannis is your older brother.
535;00:42:43,371;00:42:45,911;This isn't about the bloody line of succession.
536;00:42:45,971;00:42:47,874;That didn't matter when you rebelled
536;00:42:45,971;00:42:47,874;against the Mad King...
537;00:42:47,875;00:42:50,592;it shouldn't matter now.
538;00:42:51,696;00:42:53,726;What's the best for the kingdoms?
539;00:42:54,186;00:42:56,695;What's best for the people we rule?
540;00:42:57,836;00:43:00,146;We all know what Stannis is...
541;00:43:00,955;00:43:03,576;He inspires no love, or loyalty.
542;00:43:04,015;00:43:05,496;He's not a king.
543;00:43:07,026;00:43:08,395;I am.
544;00:43:15,235;00:43:17,025;Stannis is a commander.
545;00:43:17,965;00:43:20,334;He's led men into war, twice.
546;00:43:20,335;00:43:23,744;He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.
546;00:43:20,335;00:43:23,744;Yes. he's a good soldier, everyone knows that.
547;00:43:23,745;00:43:25,435;so is Robert.
548;00:43:26,334;00:43:30,345;Tell me something. Do you still believe
548;00:43:26,334;00:43:30,345;good soldier made good king?
549;00:43:35,905;00:43:39,675;I will not dishonor Robert's last hour
549;00:43:35,905;00:43:39,675;by shedding blood in his house...
550;00:43:40,345;00:43:43,214;and dragging frightened children,
550;00:43:40,345;00:43:43,214;from their beds.
551;00:43:56,664;00:43:59,064;You will sail to Dragonstone tonight.
552;00:43:59,284;00:44:02,114;You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon.
553;00:44:03,714;00:44:05,244;Not his steward.
554;00:44:06,554;00:44:08,504;Not his captain of the guard.
555;00:44:08,954;00:44:10,623;And not his wife.
556;00:44:16,413;00:44:18,394;Only Stannis himself.
557;00:44:19,813;00:44:21,153;Yes, my lord.
558;00:44:23,324;00:44:24,693;Now leave us.
559;00:44:34,353;00:44:36,183;My lord protector.
560;00:44:42,153;00:44:44,351;The king has no trueborn son.
561;00:44:44,898;00:44:48,813;Joffrey and Tommen, are Jaime Lannister's bastards.
562;00:44:49,702;00:44:54,075;So when the king dies...
562;00:44:49,702;00:44:54,075;The throne passes to his brother...
563;00:44:55,442;00:44:57,023;Lord Stannis.
564;00:44:58,003;00:44:59,783;So it would seem.
565;00:45:01,232;00:45:03,851;Unless...
565;00:45:01,232;00:45:03,851;There is no unless!
566;00:45:03,852;00:45:06,147;He is the rightful heir.
566;00:45:03,852;00:45:06,147;Nothing can change that.
567;00:45:06,182;00:45:08,412;And he cannot take the throne
567;00:45:06,182;00:45:08,412;without your help.
568;00:45:08,413;00:45:12,512;You would be wise to denied to him.
568;00:45:08,413;00:45:12,512;And to make sure Joffrey succeeds.
569;00:45:15,532;00:45:17,552;Do you have a shred of honor?
570;00:45:18,122;00:45:21,615;You're now Hand of The King
570;00:45:18,122;00:45:21,615;and Protector of The Realm,
571;00:45:21,616;00:45:27,232;all the power is yours, you need only...
571;00:45:21,616;00:45:27,232;reach out and take it.
572;00:45:27,362;00:45:30,571;Make peace with the Lannisters.
572;00:45:27,362;00:45:30,571;Release The Imp.
573;00:45:30,772;00:45:32,911;Wed your daughter to Joffrey.
574;00:45:33,151;00:45:35,195;We've plenty of time
574;00:45:33,151;00:45:35,195;to get rid of Stannis...
575;00:45:35,230;00:45:38,805;and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems
575;00:45:35,230;00:45:38,805;when he come into his throne...
576;00:45:38,806;00:45:41,319;we simply reveal his little secret...
577;00:45:41,320;00:45:44,216;and sit Lord Renly there instead.
577;00:45:41,320;00:45:44,216;We?
578;00:45:44,386;00:45:48,251;You'll need someone to share these burdens,
578;00:45:44,386;00:45:48,251;I assure you...
579;00:45:48,460;00:45:50,901;my price would be modest.
580;00:45:51,320;00:45:53,911;Would you suggest this treason?
581;00:45:54,480;00:45:56,260;Only if we lose.
582;00:45:58,460;00:46:01,040;Make peace with the Lannisters you say...
583;00:46:02,751;00:46:05,068;The people who tried to murder my boy.
584;00:46:05,103;00:46:10,861;We only make peace with our enemy, my lord.
584;00:46:05,103;00:46:10,861;That's why it's called making peace.
585;00:46:11,110;00:46:12,330;No...
586;00:46:13,300;00:46:14,530;I won't do it.
587;00:46:14,860;00:46:18,880;So it will be Stannis? and war?
587;00:46:14,860;00:46:18,880;There is no other choice.
588;00:46:19,970;00:46:21,470;He is the heir.
589;00:46:22,530;00:46:26,370;So why did you call me here?
589;00:46:22,530;00:46:26,370;Not for my wisdom clearly.
590;00:46:27,730;00:46:30,000;You promised Catelyn
590;00:46:27,730;00:46:30,000;you would help me.
591;00:46:30,159;00:46:33,109;The queen had a dozen knights
591;00:46:30,159;00:46:33,109;and hundred man-at-arms.
592;00:46:33,110;00:46:36,650;Enough to overwhelm what remain
592;00:46:33,110;00:46:36,650;of my household guard.
593;00:46:36,930;00:46:39,439;I need the Gold Cloaks.
594;00:46:39,769;00:46:42,330;The City Watch is two thousand strong.
595;00:46:42,759;00:46:45,319;and sworn to defend the king's peace.
596;00:46:48,270;00:46:49,719;Look at you.
597;00:46:50,769;00:46:54,839;You know what you want me to do.
597;00:46:50,769;00:46:54,839;You know it has to be done.
598;00:46:55,149;00:46:57,449;But it's not honorable, so...
599;00:46:57,939;00:47:00,159;the words stick in your throat.
600;00:47:00,639;00:47:04,702;When the Queen proclaims one king,
600;00:47:00,639;00:47:04,702;and the Hand proclaims another...
601;00:47:04,703;00:47:08,009;whose peace do the Gold Cloaks protect?
602;00:47:09,299;00:47:11,168;Who do they follow?
603;00:47:16,099;00:47:18,039;The man who pays them.
604;00:48:03,388;00:48:07,758;Hear my words,
604;00:48:03,388;00:48:07,758;and bear witness to my vow
605;00:48:07,818;00:48:11,278;Night gathers, and now my watch begins.
606;00:48:11,478;00:48:14,326;It shall not end until my death.
607;00:48:14,688;00:48:20,357;I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.
608;00:48:20,688;00:48:24,321;I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
609;00:48:24,587;00:48:27,934;I shall live and die at my post.
610;00:48:28,077;00:48:30,730;I am the sword in the darkness.
611;00:48:31,216;00:48:33,637;I am the watcher on the walls.
612;00:48:33,946;00:48:37,593;I am the shield that guards the realm of men.
613;00:48:37,986;00:48:42,134;I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch,
614;00:48:42,135;00:48:45,635;for this night and all the nights to come.
615;00:48:45,945;00:48:47,876;You knelt as boys...
616;00:48:48,145;00:48:50,955;rise now as men
616;00:48:48,145;00:48:50,955;of the Night's Watch.
617;00:49:04,043;00:49:06,303;Welcome.. Welcome...
618;00:49:13,530;00:49:14,541;What he's got there?
619;00:49:14,778;00:49:16,089;To me, Ghost.
620;00:49:16,370;00:49:17,850;Bring it here.
621;00:49:19,660;00:49:21,499;Gods be good.
622;00:49:28,732;00:49:30,202;What will they do to him?
623;00:49:33,832;00:49:35,141;When the khalasar rides...
624;00:49:35,176;00:49:39,635;he'll be leashed to the saddle and forced
624;00:49:35,176;00:49:39,635;to run behind the horses, as long as he can.
625;00:49:40,037;00:49:41,492;And when he falls?
626;00:49:43,142;00:49:45,892;I saw a man last nine miles once.
627;00:49:47,642;00:49:49,583;King Robert still wants me dead.
628;00:49:49,618;00:49:52,602;This poisoner was the first,
628;00:49:49,618;00:49:52,602;he won't be the last.
629;00:49:52,722;00:49:56,221;I thought he'd leave me alone,
629;00:49:52,722;00:49:56,221;now that my brother is gone.
630;00:49:56,222;00:49:58,561;He will never leave you alone.
631;00:49:59,272;00:50:02,521;If you ride to Asshai,
631;00:49:59,272;00:50:02,521;his assassins will follow you.
632;00:50:02,522;00:50:06,311;If you sail all the way to the Basilisk Isle,
632;00:50:02,522;00:50:06,311;his spy would tell him.
633;00:50:06,312;00:50:09,071;He will never abandon the hunt.
634;00:50:09,912;00:50:11,711;You are Targaryen.
635;00:50:11,882;00:50:13,660;The last Targaryen.
636;00:50:13,661;00:50:16,065;Your son will have Targaryen blood...
637;00:50:16,066;00:50:18,421;with 40.000 riders behind him.
638;00:50:19,741;00:50:21,491;He will not have my son.
639;00:50:22,721;00:50:24,921;He will not have you either, khaleesi.
640;00:53:27,373;00:53:28,743;Lord Stark!
641;00:53:29,303;00:53:31,222;Stop!
641;00:53:29,303;00:53:31,222;It's alright.
642;00:53:31,552;00:53:33,945;It's alright. Let him through.
642;00:53:31,552;00:53:33,945;Lord Stark...
643;00:53:33,980;00:53:36,533;King Joffrey and the queen regent
643;00:53:33,980;00:53:36,533;request you presence in the throne room.
644;00:53:36,534;00:53:38,436;King Joffrey?
645;00:53:38,571;00:53:41,723;King Robert is gone.
645;00:53:38,571;00:53:41,723;The Gods give him rest.
646;00:53:54,123;00:53:56,616;All is accomplished.
646;00:53:54,123;00:53:56,616;The City Watch is yours.
647;00:53:56,617;00:53:57,968;Good.
648;00:53:58,868;00:54:00,847;Is Lord Renly joining us?
649;00:54:02,507;00:54:06,057;I fear Lord Renly
649;00:54:02,507;00:54:06,057;has left the city.
650;00:54:06,387;00:54:09,550;He rode through the Old Gate
650;00:54:06,387;00:54:09,550;an hour before dawn...
651;00:54:09,551;00:54:13,707;with Ser Loras Tyrell
651;00:54:09,551;00:54:13,707;and some fifty retainers.
652;00:54:13,717;00:54:17,757;Last seen galloping south in some haste.
653;00:54:38,116;00:54:40,067;We stand behind you, lord Stark.
654;00:54:49,536;00:54:54,267;All hail His Grace,
654;00:54:49,536;00:54:54,267;Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister.
655;00:54:54,268;00:54:55,739;The First of His Name,
656;00:54:56,056;00:54:58,267;The King of The Andal, and The First Men...
657;00:54:58,426;00:55:03,513;Lord of The Seven Kingdoms
657;00:54:58,426;00:55:03,513;and Protector of The Realm.
658;00:55:21,656;00:55:25,824;I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation.
659;00:55:25,825;00:55:28,366;I wish to be crowned within the fortnight.
660;00:55:28,555;00:55:33,375;Today I shall accept oaths of fealty
660;00:55:28,555;00:55:33,375;from my loyal councilors.
661;00:55:37,505;00:55:38,845;Ser Barristan...
662;00:55:39,375;00:55:43,175;I believe no men here
662;00:55:39,375;00:55:43,175;could ever question your honor.
663;00:55:53,666;00:55:55,336;King Robert seal.
664;00:55:55,836;00:55:56,926;Unbroken.
665;00:56:04,554;00:56:07,585;Lord Eddard Stark is herein named...
666;00:56:07,984;00:56:09,974;Protector of The Realm...
667;00:56:11,090;00:56:12,978;to rule as regent...
668;00:56:12,979;00:56:15,770;until the heir come of age.
669;00:56:16,909;00:56:19,269;May I see that letter, Ser Barristan?
670;00:56:27,818;00:56:29,609;Protector of The Realm.
671;00:56:33,589;00:56:36,019;Is this meant to be your shield,
671;00:56:33,589;00:56:36,019;Lord Stark?
672;00:56:37,128;00:56:38,798;A piece of paper.
673;00:56:42,259;00:56:43,757;Those were the king's words.
674;00:56:43,758;00:56:45,699;We have a new king now.
675;00:56:48,078;00:56:52,008;Lord Eddard, when we last spoke
675;00:56:48,078;00:56:52,008;you offer me some counsel.
676;00:56:52,148;00:56:54,289;Allow me to return the courtesy.
677;00:56:54,810;00:56:56,540;Bend the knee, my lord.
678;00:56:56,880;00:57:00,240;Bend the knee
678;00:56:56,880;00:57:00,240;and swear loyalty to my son.
679;00:57:00,860;00:57:03,485;And we shall allow you to live out the days
679;00:57:00,860;00:57:03,485;in the grey waste...
680;00:57:03,520;00:57:06,111;you called home.
681;00:57:06,259;00:57:08,798;Your son has no claim to the throne.
682;00:57:08,829;00:57:09,566;Liar!
683;00:57:09,567;00:57:12,531;You condemn yourself
683;00:57:09,567;00:57:12,531;with your own mouth, Lord Stark.
684;00:57:12,700;00:57:15,120;Ser Barristan, seize this traitor.
685;00:57:15,990;00:57:19,609;Ser Barristan is a good man,
685;00:57:15,990;00:57:19,609;a loyal man, do him no harm.
686;00:57:22,059;00:57:23,730;You think you stand alone?
687;00:57:26,648;00:57:29,759;Kill him! Kill all of them.
687;00:57:26,648;00:57:29,759;I commanded.
688;00:57:30,048;00:57:31,268;Commander!
689;00:57:31,738;00:57:34,427;Take the queen and
689;00:57:31,738;00:57:34,427;her children to custody.
690;00:57:34,428;00:57:38,317;Escort them back to the royal apartment
690;00:57:34,428;00:57:38,317;and keep them there under guard.

692;00:57:44,248;00:57:46,008;I want no bloodshed.
693;00:57:46,758;00:57:50,998;Tell your men to lay down their swords,
693;00:57:46,758;00:57:50,998;no one needs to die.
694;00:57:53,288;00:57:54,388;Now!
695;00:58:05,817;00:58:08,718;I did warn you not to trust me.
