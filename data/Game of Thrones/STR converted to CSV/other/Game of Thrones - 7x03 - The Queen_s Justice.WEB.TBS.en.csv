83;00:07:30,457;00:07:33,456;You begged us to summon

126;00:10:23,207;00:10:26,080;is King in the North, Your Grace.
127;00:10:26,081;00:10:27,914;He's not a lord.
127;00:10:26,081;00:10:27,914;Forgive me--
128;00:10:27,915;00:10:30,164;Your Grace, this is
128;00:10:27,915;00:10:30,164;Ser Davos Seaworth.
129;00:10:30,165;00:10:32,080;Forgive me,
129;00:10:30,165;00:10:32,080;Ser Davos.
130;00:10:32,081;00:10:34,705;I never did receive
130;00:10:32,081;00:10:34,705;a formal education,
131;00:10:34,706;00:10:36,039;but I could have
131;00:10:34,706;00:10:36,039;sworn I read
132;00:10:36,040;00:10:39,331;the last King in the North
132;00:10:36,040;00:10:39,331;was Torrhen Stark,
133;00:10:39,332;00:10:42,497;who bent the knee
133;00:10:39,332;00:10:42,497;to my ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.
134;00:10:42,498;00:10:45,705;In exchange for his life
134;00:10:42,498;00:10:45,705;and the lives of the Northmen,
135;00:10:45,706;00:10:50,747;Torrhen Stark swore fealty
135;00:10:45,706;00:10:50,747;to House Targaryen in perpetuity.
136;00:10:50,748;00:10:52,247;Or do I have
136;00:10:50,748;00:10:52,247;my facts wrong?
137;00:10:52,248;00:10:54,580;I wasn't there,
137;00:10:52,248;00:10:54,580;Your Grace.
138;00:10:54,581;00:10:56,997;No, of course not.
139;00:10:56,998;00:10:59,580;But still,
139;00:10:56,998;00:10:59,580;an oath is an oath.
140;00:10:59,581;00:11:01,997;And perpetuity means--
141;00:11:01,998;00:11:04,456;what does perpetuity mean,
141;00:11:01,998;00:11:04,456;Lord Tyrion?
142;00:11:04,457;00:11:05,955;Forever.
143;00:11:05,956;00:11:08,039;Forever.
144;00:11:08,040;00:11:10,872;So I assume, my lord...
144;00:11:08,040;00:11:10,872;( sighs )
145;00:11:10,873;00:11:13,081;...you're here
145;00:11:10,873;00:11:13,081;to bend the knee.
146;00:11:15,623;00:11:17,165;I am not.
147;00:11:18,789;00:11:20,289;Oh.
148;00:11:20,290;00:11:22,123;Well, that is
148;00:11:20,290;00:11:22,123;unfortunate.
149;00:11:23,457;00:11:25,122;You've traveled
149;00:11:23,457;00:11:25,122;all this way
150;00:11:25,123;00:11:27,289;to break faith
150;00:11:25,123;00:11:27,289;with House Targaryen?
151;00:11:27,290;00:11:29,788;Break faith?
152;00:11:29,789;00:11:32,122;Your father burned
152;00:11:29,789;00:11:32,122;my grandfather alive.
153;00:11:32,123;00:11:33,830;He burned
153;00:11:32,123;00:11:33,830;my uncle alive.
154;00:11:33,831;00:11:35,164;He would have burned
154;00:11:33,831;00:11:35,164;the Seven Kingdoms--
155;00:11:35,165;00:11:38,248;My father...
155;00:11:35,165;00:11:38,248;was an evil man.
156;00:11:40,081;00:11:42,290;On behalf
156;00:11:40,081;00:11:42,290;of House Targaryen...
157;00:11:43,539;00:11:45,164;I ask your forgiveness
158;00:11:45,165;00:11:48,122;for the crimes he committed
158;00:11:45,165;00:11:48,122;against your family.
159;00:11:48,123;00:11:50,997;And I ask you
159;00:11:48,123;00:11:50,997;not to judge a daughter
160;00:11:50,998;00:11:53,373;by the sins
160;00:11:50,998;00:11:53,373;of her father.
161;00:11:54,831;00:11:58,331;Our two houses
161;00:11:54,831;00:11:58,331;were allies for centuries,
162;00:11:58,332;00:12:00,206;and those were
162;00:11:58,332;00:12:00,206;the best centuries
163;00:12:00,207;00:12:02,331;the Seven Kingdoms
163;00:12:00,207;00:12:02,331;have ever known.
164;00:12:02,332;00:12:04,830;Centuries of peace
164;00:12:02,332;00:12:04,830;and prosperity
165;00:12:04,831;00:12:07,663;with a Targaryen
165;00:12:04,831;00:12:07,663;sitting on the Iron Throne
166;00:12:07,664;00:12:11,663;and a Stark serving
166;00:12:07,664;00:12:11,663;as Warden of the North.
167;00:12:11,664;00:12:15,414;I am the last Targaryen,
167;00:12:11,664;00:12:15,414;Jon Snow.
168;00:12:15,415;00:12:17,830;Honor the pledge
168;00:12:15,415;00:12:17,830;your ancestor made to mine.
169;00:12:17,831;00:12:21,497;Bend the knee and I will name you
169;00:12:17,831;00:12:21,497;Warden of the North.
170;00:12:21,498;00:12:23,705;Together, we will
170;00:12:21,498;00:12:23,705;save this country
171;00:12:23,706;00:12:26,332;from those
171;00:12:23,706;00:12:26,332;who would destroy it.
172;00:12:36,165;00:12:38,206;You're right.
173;00:12:38,207;00:12:40,705;You're not guilty
173;00:12:38,207;00:12:40,705;of your father's crimes.
174;00:12:40,706;00:12:45,538;And I'm not beholden
174;00:12:40,706;00:12:45,538;to my ancestor's vows.
175;00:12:45,539;00:12:47,538;Then why are you here?
176;00:12:47,539;00:12:50,373;Because I need your help,
176;00:12:47,539;00:12:50,373;and you need mine.
177;00:12:53,581;00:12:55,538;Did you see
177;00:12:53,581;00:12:55,538;three dragons
178;00:12:55,539;00:12:57,497;flying overhead
178;00:12:55,539;00:12:57,497;when you arrived?
179;00:12:57,498;00:12:58,580;I did.
180;00:12:58,581;00:13:00,872;And did you see
180;00:12:58,581;00:13:00,872;the Dothraki,
181;00:13:00,873;00:13:03,080;all of whom have sworn
181;00:13:00,873;00:13:03,080;to kill for me?
182;00:13:03,081;00:13:05,039;They're hard to miss.
183;00:13:05,040;00:13:09,080;But still, I need your help?
183;00:13:05,040;00:13:09,080;Davos: Not to defeat Cersei.
184;00:13:09,081;00:13:12,414;You could storm King's Landing tomorrow
184;00:13:09,081;00:13:12,414;and the city would fall.
185;00:13:12,415;00:13:14,663;Hell, we almost took it
185;00:13:12,415;00:13:14,663;and we didn't even have dragons.
186;00:13:14,664;00:13:18,788;Almost.
186;00:13:14,664;00:13:18,788;But you haven't stormed King's Landing.
187;00:13:18,789;00:13:20,414;Why not?
188;00:13:20,415;00:13:22,122;The only reason
188;00:13:20,415;00:13:22,122;I can see
189;00:13:22,123;00:13:24,372;is you don't want to kill
189;00:13:22,123;00:13:24,372;thousands of innocent people.
190;00:13:24,373;00:13:26,414;It's the fastest way
190;00:13:24,373;00:13:26,414;to win the war,
191;00:13:26,415;00:13:28,247;but you won't do it,
192;00:13:28,248;00:13:31,456;which means,
192;00:13:28,248;00:13:31,456;at the very least,
193;00:13:31,457;00:13:32,915;you're better
193;00:13:31,457;00:13:32,915;than Cersei.
194;00:13:34,415;00:13:37,789;Still, that doesn't explain
194;00:13:34,415;00:13:37,789;why I need your help.
195;00:13:39,664;00:13:44,289;Because right now,
195;00:13:39,664;00:13:44,289;you and I and Cersei and everyone else,
196;00:13:44,290;00:13:45,914;we're children
196;00:13:44,290;00:13:45,914;playing at a game,
197;00:13:45,915;00:13:47,997;screaming that
197;00:13:45,915;00:13:47,997;the rules aren't fair.
198;00:13:47,998;00:13:50,122;You told me you liked this man.
198;00:13:47,998;00:13:50,122;I do.
199;00:13:50,123;00:13:53,622;In the time since he's met me,
199;00:13:50,123;00:13:53,622;he's refused to call me queen,
200;00:13:53,623;00:13:56,497;he's refused to bow,
200;00:13:53,623;00:13:56,497;and now he's calling me a child.
201;00:13:56,498;00:14:00,289;I believe he's calling all of us children.
201;00:13:56,498;00:14:00,289;Figure of speech.
202;00:14:00,290;00:14:03,622;Your Grace, everyone you know will die
202;00:14:00,290;00:14:03,622;before winter's over
203;00:14:03,623;00:14:05,788;if we don't defeat
203;00:14:03,623;00:14:05,788;the enemy to the north.
204;00:14:05,789;00:14:08,456;As far as I can see,
204;00:14:05,789;00:14:08,456;you  are the enemy to the north.
205;00:14:08,457;00:14:10,123;I am not your enemy.
206;00:14:11,539;00:14:13,456;The dead
206;00:14:11,539;00:14:13,456;are the enemy.
207;00:14:13,457;00:14:14,998;The dead?
208;00:14:16,290;00:14:17,872;Is that another
208;00:14:16,290;00:14:17,872;figure of speech?
209;00:14:17,873;00:14:19,497;The Army of the Dead
209;00:14:17,873;00:14:19,497;is on the march.
210;00:14:19,498;00:14:21,580;The Army of the Dead?
211;00:14:21,581;00:14:23,747;You don't
211;00:14:21,581;00:14:23,747;know me well, my lord,
212;00:14:23,748;00:14:27,080;but do you think
212;00:14:23,748;00:14:27,080;I'm a liar or a madman?
213;00:14:27,081;00:14:29,622;No, I don't think
213;00:14:27,081;00:14:29,622;you're either of those things.
214;00:14:29,623;00:14:31,747;The Army of the Dead
214;00:14:29,623;00:14:31,747;is real.
215;00:14:31,748;00:14:33,206;The white walkers
215;00:14:31,748;00:14:33,206;are real.
216;00:14:33,207;00:14:36,122;The Night King is real.
216;00:14:33,207;00:14:36,122;I've seen them.
217;00:14:36,123;00:14:37,663;If they get
217;00:14:36,123;00:14:37,663;past the Wall
218;00:14:37,664;00:14:40,165;and we're squabbling
218;00:14:37,664;00:14:40,165;amongst ourselves...
219;00:14:43,207;00:14:44,789;we're finished.
220;00:14:50,373;00:14:52,664;I was born
220;00:14:50,373;00:14:52,664;at Dragonstone.
221;00:14:54,290;00:14:56,997;Not that I can
221;00:14:54,290;00:14:56,997;remember it.
222;00:14:56,998;00:15:00,456;We fled before
222;00:14:56,998;00:15:00,456;Robert's assassins could find us.
223;00:15:00,457;00:15:03,663;Robert was your father's
223;00:15:00,457;00:15:03,663;best friend, no?
224;00:15:03,664;00:15:07,497;I wonder if your father knew
224;00:15:03,664;00:15:07,497;his best friend sent assassins
225;00:15:07,498;00:15:10,040;to murder a baby girl
225;00:15:07,498;00:15:10,040;in her crib.
226;00:15:11,498;00:15:13,415;Not that it matters now,
226;00:15:11,498;00:15:13,415;of course.
227;00:15:14,956;00:15:18,497;I spent my life
227;00:15:14,956;00:15:18,497;in foreign lands.
228;00:15:18,498;00:15:20,872;So many men
228;00:15:18,498;00:15:20,872;have tried to kill me,
229;00:15:20,873;00:15:24,372;I don't remember
229;00:15:20,873;00:15:24,372;all their names.
230;00:15:24,373;00:15:28,456;I have been sold
230;00:15:24,373;00:15:28,456;like a broodmare.
231;00:15:28,457;00:15:31,997;I've been chained
231;00:15:28,457;00:15:31,997;and betrayed,
232;00:15:31,998;00:15:34,788;raped and defiled.
233;00:15:34,789;00:15:37,039;Do you know
233;00:15:34,789;00:15:37,039;what kept me standing
234;00:15:37,040;00:15:39,997;through all those years
234;00:15:37,040;00:15:39,997;in exile?
235;00:15:39,998;00:15:42,955;Faith.
236;00:15:42,956;00:15:45,206;Not in any gods,
237;00:15:45,207;00:15:48,747;not in myths
237;00:15:45,207;00:15:48,747;and legends.
238;00:15:48,748;00:15:51,372;In myself.
239;00:15:51,373;00:15:54,538;In Daenerys Targaryen.
240;00:15:54,539;00:15:58,080;The world hadn't seen

243;00:16:05,248;00:16:07,622;They did for me.
244;00:16:07,623;00:16:12,080;I was born to rule
244;00:16:07,623;00:16:12,080;the Seven Kingdoms,
245;00:16:12,081;00:16:14,207;and I will.
246;00:16:16,539;00:16:19,080;You'll be ruling
246;00:16:16,539;00:16:19,080;over a graveyard

250;00:16:28,415;00:16:30,247;and join you
250;00:16:28,415;00:16:30,247;in fighting
251;00:16:30,248;00:16:31,748;whatever you saw

253;00:16:36,165;00:16:39,080;I understand that.
253;00:16:36,165;00:16:39,080;It sounds like nonsense.
254;00:16:39,081;00:16:42,872;But if destiny has brought

255;00:16:42,873;00:16:46,080;it has also made Jon Snow
255;00:16:42,873;00:16:46,080;King in the North.
256;00:16:46,081;00:16:49,206;You were the first

260;00:16:55,748;00:16:57,122;Not because
260;00:16:55,748;00:16:57,122;of his birthright.
261;00:16:57,123;00:16:59,497;He has no birthright.
261;00:16:57,123;00:16:59,497;He's a damn bastard.
262;00:16:59,498;00:17:04,538;All those hard sons of bitches
262;00:16:59,498;00:17:04,538;chose him as their leader
263;00:17:04,539;00:17:06,248;because they
263;00:17:04,539;00:17:06,248;believe in him.
264;00:17:07,664;00:17:09,622;All those things

265;00:17:09,623;00:17:11,164;those things.
266;00:17:11,165;00:17:13,372;He fought those things
266;00:17:11,165;00:17:13,372;for the good of his people.
267;00:17:13,373;00:17:14,955;He risked his life
267;00:17:13,373;00:17:14,955;for his people.
268;00:17:14,956;00:17:16,747;He took a knife in the heart
268;00:17:14,956;00:17:16,747;for his people.
269;00:17:16,748;00:17:18,498;He gave his own--
270;00:17:24,664;00:17:27,414;If we don't put aside our enmities
270;00:17:24,664;00:17:27,414;and band together,
271;00:17:27,415;00:17:29,497;we will die.
272;00:17:29,498;00:17:33,164;And then it doesn't matter
272;00:17:29,498;00:17:33,164;whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.
273;00:17:33,165;00:17:35,497;If it doesn't matter,
273;00:17:33,165;00:17:35,497;then you might as well kneel.
274;00:17:35,498;00:17:37,663;Swear your allegiance
274;00:17:35,498;00:17:37,663;to Queen Daenerys,

367;00:23:56,664;00:23:59,872;they'll cheer to see your head
367;00:23:56,664;00:23:59,872;mounted on a spike.
368;00:23:59,873;00:24:01,372;Or yours.
369;00:24:01,373;00:24:04,497;They just like
369;00:24:01,373;00:24:04,497;severed heads, really.
370;00:24:04,498;00:24:07,747;Listen, if you have
370;00:24:04,498;00:24:07,747;any advice at all,
371;00:24:07,748;00:24:09,331;I would love to hear it.
372;00:24:09,332;00:24:12,372;When we have an hour or two
372;00:24:09,332;00:24:12,372;to speak as brothers.
373;00:24:12,373;00:24:14,080;Advice?
374;00:24:14,081;00:24:17,747;Does she like it
374;00:24:14,081;00:24:17,747;gentle or rough?
375;00:24:17,748;00:24:19,414;A finger in the bum?
376;00:24:19,415;00:24:22,706;Shh, shh, shh, shh, not now.
376;00:24:19,415;00:24:22,706;We'll talk later.
377;00:24:40,539;00:24:43,497;Cersei: I want you to know
377;00:24:40,539;00:24:43,497;I understand.
378;00:24:43,498;00:24:45,080;Even though
378;00:24:43,498;00:24:45,080;we're enemies, you and I,
379;00:24:45,081;00:24:46,748;I understand the fury
379;00:24:45,081;00:24:46,748;that drives you.
380;00:24:47,915;00:24:49,247;I was there that day
381;00:24:49,248;00:24:51,040;when Ser Gregor crushed
381;00:24:49,248;00:24:51,040;your lover's head.
382;00:24:53,581;00:24:55,914;If I close my eyes,
383;00:24:55,915;00:24:58,205;I can hear the sound
383;00:24:55,915;00:24:58,205;of Oberyn's skull breaking.
384;00:24:58,206;00:24:58,911;( grunts )
385;00:24:58,915;00:25:01,122;The sound
385;00:24:58,915;00:25:01,122;of your scream.
386;00:25:01,123;00:25:02,622;I never heard
386;00:25:01,123;00:25:02,622;a sound like that.
387;00:25:02,623;00:25:04,581;I thought,
387;00:25:02,623;00:25:04,581;That's true love.
388;00:25:06,165;00:25:08,456;Oberyn looked beautiful that day.
388;00:25:06,165;00:25:08,456;He really did.
389;00:25:08,457;00:25:09,830;No one moved like him.
390;00:25:09,831;00:25:12,955;No one had such skill
390;00:25:09,831;00:25:12,955;with a spear.
391;00:25:12,956;00:25:16,039;Even Ser Gregor
391;00:25:12,956;00:25:16,039;couldn't stop him.
392;00:25:16,040;00:25:18,497;If only he hadn't
392;00:25:16,040;00:25:18,497;taunted him.
393;00:25:18,498;00:25:22,456;He could've walked away
393;00:25:18,498;00:25:22,456;and left poor Ser Gregor to die.
394;00:25:22,457;00:25:24,497;But that wasn't
394;00:25:22,457;00:25:24,497;your lover's way, was it?
395;00:25:24,498;00:25:27,331;Now he's buried
395;00:25:24,498;00:25:27,331;somewhere.
396;00:25:27,332;00:25:30,080;And here's Ser Gregor,
396;00:25:27,332;00:25:30,080;stronger than ever.
397;00:25:30,081;00:25:31,998;That must be
397;00:25:30,081;00:25:31,998;difficult for you.
398;00:25:35,956;00:25:37,955;When my daughter
398;00:25:35,956;00:25:37,955;was taken from me,
399;00:25:37,956;00:25:41,080;my only daughter...
400;00:25:41,081;00:25:43,872;well, you can't
400;00:25:41,081;00:25:43,872;imagine how that feels
401;00:25:43,873;00:25:46,122;unless you've
401;00:25:43,873;00:25:46,122;lost a child.
402;00:25:46,123;00:25:48,788;I fed her at my own breast
402;00:25:46,123;00:25:48,788;even though they told me
403;00:25:48,789;00:25:51,497;to give her
403;00:25:48,789;00:25:51,497;to the wet nurse.
404;00:25:51,498;00:25:54,997;I couldn't bear to see her
404;00:25:51,498;00:25:54,997;in another woman's arms.
405;00:25:54,998;00:25:57,247;I never got
405;00:25:54,998;00:25:57,247;to have a mother,
406;00:25:57,248;00:25:58,663;but Myrcella did.
407;00:25:58,664;00:26:02,331;She was mine,
407;00:25:58,664;00:26:02,331;and you took her from me.
408;00:26:02,332;00:26:04,373;Why did you do that?
409;00:26:10,956;00:26:12,332;Doesn't matter now.
410;00:26:20,915;00:26:23,663;Your daughter's
410;00:26:20,915;00:26:23,663;a beauty, too.
411;00:26:23,664;00:26:26,289;Those brown eyes.
412;00:26:26,290;00:26:27,998;Those lips.
413;00:26:29,623;00:26:31,663;Perfect Dornish beauty.
414;00:26:31,664;00:26:33,538;I imagine
414;00:26:31,664;00:26:33,538;she's your favorite.
415;00:26:33,539;00:26:36,705;I know, I know,
415;00:26:33,539;00:26:36,705;we're not supposed to have favorites,
416;00:26:36,706;00:26:38,873;but still,
416;00:26:36,706;00:26:38,873;we're only human.
417;00:26:40,373;00:26:41,955;We love whom we love.

420;00:26:46,831;00:26:50,206;That gag makes it impossible
420;00:26:46,831;00:26:50,206;to understand what you're saying.
421;00:26:50,207;00:26:52,040;It must be frustrating.
422;00:26:55,207;00:26:58,206;We all make
422;00:26:55,207;00:26:58,206;our choices.
423;00:26:58,207;00:27:00,622;You chose to murder
423;00:26:58,207;00:27:00,622;my daughter.
424;00:27:00,623;00:27:02,872;You must have felt powerful
424;00:27:00,623;00:27:02,872;after you made that choice.

426;00:27:11,664;00:27:13,039;I don't sleep very well.
427;00:27:13,040;00:27:15,414;Not at all, really.
428;00:27:15,415;00:27:17,331;I lie in bed
428;00:27:15,415;00:27:17,331;and I stare at the canopy
429;00:27:17,332;00:27:19,705;and imagine ways
429;00:27:17,332;00:27:19,705;of killing my enemies.
430;00:27:19,706;00:27:23,581;How to destroy Ellaria Sand,

431;00:27:25,081;00:27:26,747;I thought about

433;00:27:28,915;00:27:33,622;It would be poetic, I suppose,
433;00:27:28,915;00:27:33,622;but fast, too fast.
434;00:27:33,623;00:27:36,581;I thought about having him

489;00:31:45,915;00:31:48,663;wants its gold back.
490;00:31:48,664;00:31:51,247;Your father never
490;00:31:48,664;00:31:51,247;minced words either.
491;00:31:51,248;00:31:55,080;But, yes, your debts
491;00:31:51,248;00:31:55,080;are considerable.
492;00:31:55,081;00:31:57,955;And you're now engaged in a conflict
492;00:31:55,081;00:31:57,955;on several fronts.
493;00:31:57,956;00:32:00,872;We both know
493;00:31:57,956;00:32:00,872;how expensive war can be.
494;00:32:00,873;00:32:03,080;And we both know
494;00:32:00,873;00:32:03,080;gold wins wars.
495;00:32:03,081;00:32:04,538;Your vaults are empty.
496;00:32:04,539;00:32:07,039;Your late husband's
496;00:32:04,539;00:32:07,039;profligacy saw to that.
497;00:32:07,040;00:32:10,372;Your wealthiest allies,
497;00:32:07,040;00:32:10,372;the Tyrells, are now your enemies.
498;00:32:10,373;00:32:13,955;You are surrounded
498;00:32:10,373;00:32:13,955;on all sides by rivals for the throne.
499;00:32:13,956;00:32:15,914;And the Iron Bank
499;00:32:13,956;00:32:15,914;wants to bet on a winner.
500;00:32:15,915;00:32:17,622;We don't make bets.
501;00:32:17,623;00:32:21,206;We invest in endeavors
501;00:32:17,623;00:32:21,206;we deem likely to be successful.
502;00:32:21,207;00:32:24,164;A fancy way
502;00:32:21,207;00:32:24,164;of saying bet.
503;00:32:24,165;00:32:27,914;The war's already begun.
503;00:32:24,165;00:32:27,914;I've drawn first blood.
504;00:32:27,915;00:32:30,914;I decapitated
504;00:32:27,915;00:32:30,914;the Dornish snake.
505;00:32:30,915;00:32:32,955;My armada owns
505;00:32:30,915;00:32:32,955;the Narrow Sea.
506;00:32:32,956;00:32:35,414;Euron Greyjoy's armada
506;00:32:32,956;00:32:35,414;owns the Narrow Sea.
507;00:32:35,415;00:32:36,914;Euron Greyjoy
507;00:32:35,415;00:32:36,914;is loyal to me.
508;00:32:36,915;00:32:39,122;For now.
509;00:32:39,123;00:32:42,872;Daenerys Targaryen has
509;00:32:39,123;00:32:42,872;three full-grown dragons.
510;00:32:42,873;00:32:47,206;How well do wooden ships fare against
510;00:32:42,873;00:32:47,206;fire-breathing dragons?
511;00:32:47,207;00:32:52,247;Her dragons might not be
511;00:32:47,207;00:32:52,247;as invulnerable as some think.
512;00:32:52,248;00:32:54,622;But let's talk about
512;00:32:52,248;00:32:54,622;the Targaryen girl.
513;00:32:54,623;00:32:56,538;You want to
513;00:32:54,623;00:32:56,538;invest in her?
514;00:32:56,539;00:33:00,914;I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested
514;00:32:56,539;00:33:00,914;considerable gold in the slave trade.
515;00:33:00,915;00:33:03,164;How are your profits
516;00:33:03,165;00:33:05,705;now that Daenerys
516;00:33:03,165;00:33:05,705;has freed all the slaves?
517;00:33:05,706;00:33:09,872;The slave trade has
517;00:33:05,706;00:33:09,872;entered a downturn, it's true.
518;00:33:09,873;00:33:11,747;From what I gather,
518;00:33:09,873;00:33:11,747;she considers herself
519;00:33:11,748;00:33:15,080;more of a revolutionary
519;00:33:11,748;00:33:15,080;than a monarch.
520;00:33:15,081;00:33:18,997;In your experience, how do bankers
520;00:33:15,081;00:33:18,997;usually fare with revolutionaries?
521;00:33:18,998;00:33:21,997;The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank
521;00:33:18,998;00:33:21,997;quite a lot of money,
522;00:33:21,998;00:33:24,164;but Lannisters
522;00:33:21,998;00:33:24,164;always pay their debts.
523;00:33:24,165;00:33:28,581;Do former slaves
523;00:33:24,165;00:33:28,581;or Dothraki or dragons?
524;00:33:32,165;00:33:34,164;Your father's daughter,
524;00:33:32,165;00:33:34,164;indeed.
525;00:33:34,165;00:33:35,497;Give me a fortnight.
526;00:33:35,498;00:33:37,705;Stay in King's Landing
526;00:33:35,498;00:33:37,705;as my honored guest.
527;00:33:37,706;00:33:39,122;And when you
527;00:33:37,706;00:33:39,122;return to Braavos,
528;00:33:39,123;00:33:43,581;I swear to you, my debt
528;00:33:39,123;00:33:43,581;will be paid in full.
529;00:34:07,207;00:34:11,040;I came down here to brood over
529;00:34:07,207;00:34:11,040;my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.
530;00:34:13,581;00:34:15,122;You're making it
530;00:34:13,581;00:34:15,122;difficult.
531;00:34:15,123;00:34:18,789;You look a lot better
531;00:34:15,123;00:34:18,789;brooding than I do.
532;00:34:20,498;00:34:23,039;You make me feel like
532;00:34:20,498;00:34:23,039;I'm failing at brooding over failing.
533;00:34:23,040;00:34:24,747;I'm a prisoner
533;00:34:23,040;00:34:24,747;on this island.
534;00:34:24,748;00:34:28,705;I wouldn't say you're
534;00:34:24,748;00:34:28,705;a prisoner on this island.
535;00:34:28,706;00:34:30,206;You're free
535;00:34:28,706;00:34:30,206;to walk the castle,
536;00:34:30,207;00:34:32,122;the beaches,
536;00:34:30,207;00:34:32,122;to go wherever you want.
537;00:34:32,123;00:34:34,289;Except to my ship.
538;00:34:34,290;00:34:35,705;You took my ship.
539;00:34:35,706;00:34:37,663;I wouldn't say
539;00:34:35,706;00:34:37,663;we took your ship.
540;00:34:37,664;00:34:40,164;I'm not playing
540;00:34:37,664;00:34:40,164;word games with you.
541;00:34:40,165;00:34:42,039;The dead are coming
541;00:34:40,165;00:34:42,039;for us all.
542;00:34:42,040;00:34:43,705;Why don't you
542;00:34:42,040;00:34:43,705;figure out what to do
543;00:34:43,706;00:34:45,788;about my missing fleet
543;00:34:43,706;00:34:45,788;and murdered allies,
544;00:34:45,789;00:34:48,663;and I'll figure out what to do
544;00:34:45,789;00:34:48,663;about your walking dead men.
545;00:34:48,664;00:34:50,872;It's hard for me to fathom.
545;00:34:48,664;00:34:50,872;It really is.
546;00:34:50,873;00:34:53,998;If someone told me about the white walkers
546;00:34:50,873;00:34:53,998;and the Night King...
547;00:35:01,415;00:35:02,664;You probably
547;00:35:01,415;00:35:02,664;don't believe me.
548;00:35:05,123;00:35:07,289;I do, actually.
549;00:35:07,290;00:35:08,831;You didn't before.
550;00:35:10,539;00:35:12,747;Grumkins and snarks,
550;00:35:10,539;00:35:12,747;you called them.
551;00:35:12,748;00:35:14,830;Do you remember?
552;00:35:14,831;00:35:16,914;You said
552;00:35:14,831;00:35:16,914;it was all nonsense.
553;00:35:16,915;00:35:20,039;It was nonsense.
553;00:35:16,915;00:35:20,039;Everybody knew it.
554;00:35:20,040;00:35:23,164;But then Mormont
554;00:35:20,040;00:35:23,164;saw them
555;00:35:23,165;00:35:24,580;and you saw them.
556;00:35:24,581;00:35:26,247;And I trust the eyes
556;00:35:24,581;00:35:26,247;of an honest man
557;00:35:26,248;00:35:28,248;more than I trust
557;00:35:26,248;00:35:28,248;what everybody knows.
558;00:35:29,581;00:35:31,830;How do I convince people
558;00:35:29,581;00:35:31,830;who don't know me
559;00:35:31,831;00:35:34,580;that an enemy they don't believe in
559;00:35:31,831;00:35:34,580;is coming to kill them all?
560;00:35:34,581;00:35:37,914;Good question.
560;00:35:34,581;00:35:37,914;I know it's a good question.
561;00:35:37,915;00:35:40,080;I'm looking
561;00:35:37,915;00:35:40,080;for an answer.
562;00:35:40,081;00:35:44,372;People's minds aren't made for
562;00:35:40,081;00:35:44,372;problems that large.
563;00:35:44,373;00:35:46,830;White walkers,
563;00:35:44,373;00:35:46,830;the Night King,
564;00:35:46,831;00:35:48,914;Army of the Dead--
565;00:35:48,915;00:35:50,538;it's almost a relief
565;00:35:48,915;00:35:50,538;to confront
566;00:35:50,539;00:35:53,415;a comfortable,
566;00:35:50,539;00:35:53,415;familiar monster like my sister.
567;00:35:55,748;00:35:58,706;I need to help prepare my people
567;00:35:55,748;00:35:58,706;for what's coming.
568;00:36:00,415;00:36:02,748;I can't help them
568;00:36:00,415;00:36:02,748;from here.
569;00:36:04,248;00:36:05,498;I'd like to leave.
570;00:36:06,956;00:36:09,456;It seems unlikely that
570;00:36:06,956;00:36:09,456;you became King in the North
571;00:36:09,457;00:36:11,123;by giving up
571;00:36:09,457;00:36:11,123;that easily.
572;00:36:13,290;00:36:16,414;Everyone told me to learn
572;00:36:13,290;00:36:16,414;from my father's mistakes.
573;00:36:16,415;00:36:18,206;Don't go south.
574;00:36:18,207;00:36:20,872;Don't answer a summons
574;00:36:18,207;00:36:20,872;from the Mad King's daughter,
575;00:36:20,873;00:36:22,290;a foreign invader.
576;00:36:24,664;00:36:27,372;And here I am,
577;00:36:27,373;00:36:28,914;a Northern fool.
578;00:36:28,915;00:36:31,372;Children are not
578;00:36:28,915;00:36:31,372;their fathers,
579;00:36:31,373;00:36:33,081;luckily
579;00:36:31,373;00:36:33,081;for all of us.
580;00:36:34,581;00:36:36,788;And sometimes there's more
580;00:36:34,581;00:36:36,788;to foreign invaders
581;00:36:36,789;00:36:38,997;and Northern fools
581;00:36:36,789;00:36:38,997;than meets the eye.
582;00:36:38,998;00:36:43,206;Daenerys could have sailed
582;00:36:38,998;00:36:43,206;for Westeros long ago, but she didn't.
583;00:36:43,207;00:36:45,039;Instead, she stayed
583;00:36:43,207;00:36:45,039;where she was
584;00:36:45,040;00:36:47,705;and saved many people
584;00:36:45,040;00:36:47,705;from horrible fates,
585;00:36:47,706;00:36:50,039;some of whom are on this island
585;00:36:47,706;00:36:50,039;with us right now.
586;00:36:50,040;00:36:51,622;While you're
586;00:36:50,040;00:36:51,622;our guest here,
587;00:36:51,623;00:36:53,164;you might consider
587;00:36:51,623;00:36:53,164;asking them
588;00:36:53,165;00:36:55,914;what they think
588;00:36:53,165;00:36:55,914;of the Mad King's daughter.
589;00:36:55,915;00:36:58,997;She protects people
589;00:36:55,915;00:36:58,997;from monsters,
590;00:36:58,998;00:37:00,538;just as you do.
591;00:37:00,539;00:37:02,997;It's why she came here.
592;00:37:02,998;00:37:04,538;And she's not about
592;00:37:02,998;00:37:04,538;to head north
593;00:37:04,539;00:37:05,997;to fight an enemy
593;00:37:04,539;00:37:05,997;she's never seen
594;00:37:05,998;00:37:08,497;on the word of a man
594;00:37:05,998;00:37:08,497;she doesn't know.
595;00:37:08,498;00:37:10,914;After a single meeting,
596;00:37:10,915;00:37:13,706;it's not a reasonable
596;00:37:10,915;00:37:13,706;thing to ask.
597;00:37:20,081;00:37:22,332;So, do you have anything
597;00:37:20,081;00:37:22,332;reasonable to ask?
598;00:37:27,165;00:37:28,331;What do you mean?
599;00:37:28,332;00:37:30,580;Maybe you are
599;00:37:28,332;00:37:30,580;a Northern fool.
600;00:37:30,581;00:37:34,248;I'm asking if there's something
600;00:37:30,581;00:37:34,248;I can do to help you.
601;00:37:37,207;00:37:38,747;Dragonglass?
601;00:37:37,207;00:37:38,747;Tyrion: Yes.
602;00:37:38,748;00:37:41,206;Volcanic glass,
602;00:37:38,748;00:37:41,206;obsidian.
603;00:37:41,207;00:37:43,206;He says you have
603;00:37:41,207;00:37:43,206;a tremendous amount of it here.
604;00:37:43,207;00:37:44,997;Why are we talking
604;00:37:43,207;00:37:44,997;about glass?
605;00:37:44,998;00:37:46,872;We just lost
605;00:37:44,998;00:37:46,872;two of our allies.
606;00:37:46,873;00:37:50,248;Which is why I was
606;00:37:46,873;00:37:50,248;speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.
607;00:37:52,623;00:37:56,372;And what does the King in the North
607;00:37:52,623;00:37:56,372;want with dragonglass?
608;00:37:56,373;00:37:58,705;Apparently, it can be
608;00:37:56,373;00:37:58,705;turned into weapons
609;00:37:58,706;00:38:01,830;that kill white walkers
609;00:37:58,706;00:38:01,830;and their foot soldiers.
610;00:38:01,831;00:38:03,997;Or stop them.
611;00:38:03,998;00:38:05,289;Destroy them.
612;00:38:05,290;00:38:06,915;Unsure about
612;00:38:05,290;00:38:06,915;the nomenclature.
613;00:38:08,873;00:38:11,830;And what do you think
613;00:38:08,873;00:38:11,830;about this Army of the Dead
614;00:38:11,831;00:38:14,705;and white walkers
614;00:38:11,831;00:38:14,705;and Night Kings?
615;00:38:14,706;00:38:17,331;I'd very much like to believe
615;00:38:14,706;00:38:17,331;that Jon Snow is wrong.
616;00:38:17,332;00:38:20,580;But a wise man once said
616;00:38:17,332;00:38:20,580;that you should never believe a thing
617;00:38:20,581;00:38:23,123;simply because
617;00:38:20,581;00:38:23,123;you want to believe it.
618;00:38:25,831;00:38:28,997;Which wise man
618;00:38:25,831;00:38:28,997;said this?
619;00:38:28,998;00:38:30,872;I don't remember.
620;00:38:30,873;00:38:34,290;Are you trying to present
620;00:38:30,873;00:38:34,290;your own statements as ancient wisdom?
621;00:38:35,498;00:38:37,705;I would never do that.
622;00:38:37,706;00:38:38,748;To you.
623;00:38:40,581;00:38:44,247;The reason I believe Jon Snow
623;00:38:40,581;00:38:44,247;is because he's here.
624;00:38:44,248;00:38:46,663;All of his advisors
624;00:38:44,248;00:38:46,663;would have told him not to come.
625;00:38:46,664;00:38:48,747;I would have told him
625;00:38:46,664;00:38:48,747;not to come.
626;00:38:48,748;00:38:51,080;And he's here anyway.
627;00:38:51,081;00:38:53,497;You don't
627;00:38:51,081;00:38:53,497;have to believe him.
628;00:38:53,498;00:38:55,538;Let him mine
628;00:38:53,498;00:38:55,538;the dragonglass.
629;00:38:55,539;00:38:57,164;If he's wrong,
629;00:38:55,539;00:38:57,164;it's worthless.
630;00:38:57,165;00:38:59,247;You didn't even know
630;00:38:57,165;00:38:59,247;it was here.
631;00:38:59,248;00:39:01,788;It's nothing to you.
632;00:39:01,789;00:39:05,080;Give him something
632;00:39:01,789;00:39:05,080;by giving him nothing.
633;00:39:05,081;00:39:07,788;Take a step toward
633;00:39:05,081;00:39:07,788;a more productive relationship
634;00:39:07,789;00:39:10,372;with a possible ally.
635;00:39:10,373;00:39:13,747;Keep him occupied
635;00:39:10,373;00:39:13,747;while we focus on the task at hand--
636;00:39:13,748;00:39:15,123;Casterly Rock.
637;00:39:16,373;00:39:18,164;What was that
637;00:39:16,373;00:39:18,164;Ser Davos said
638;00:39:18,165;00:39:22,206;about taking a knife in the heart
638;00:39:18,165;00:39:22,206;for his people?
639;00:39:22,207;00:39:23,997;Did you notice that?
640;00:39:23,998;00:39:26,456;You must allow them
640;00:39:23,998;00:39:26,456;their flights of fancy.
641;00:39:26,457;00:39:28,623;It's dreary
641;00:39:26,457;00:39:28,623;in the North.
642;00:39:31,207;00:39:34,123;( screeching )
643;00:39:44,498;00:39:45,998;Amazing thing
643;00:39:44,498;00:39:45,998;to see.
644;00:39:47,498;00:39:50,539;I named them for my brothers,
644;00:39:47,498;00:39:50,539;Viserys and Rhaegar.
645;00:39:51,664;00:39:53,165;They're both gone now.
646;00:39:55,457;00:39:56,831;You lost
646;00:39:55,457;00:39:56,831;two brothers as well.
647;00:39:59,998;00:40:02,873;People thought dragons
647;00:39:59,998;00:40:02,873;were gone forever, but here they are.
648;00:40:04,623;00:40:07,457;Perhaps we should all be examining
648;00:40:04,623;00:40:07,457;what we think we know.
649;00:40:13,415;00:40:15,705;You've been talking
649;00:40:13,415;00:40:15,705;to Tyrion.
650;00:40:15,706;00:40:18,456;He is my Hand.
651;00:40:18,457;00:40:21,081;He enjoys talking.
651;00:40:18,457;00:40:21,081;We all enjoy what we're good at.
652;00:40:22,539;00:40:24,040;I don't.
653;00:40:29,040;00:40:32,039;You know I'm not going to let Cersei
653;00:40:29,040;00:40:32,039;stay on the Iron Throne.
654;00:40:32,040;00:40:33,206;I never expected
654;00:40:32,040;00:40:33,206;that you would.
655;00:40:33,207;00:40:34,456;And I haven't
655;00:40:33,207;00:40:34,456;changed my mind
656;00:40:34,457;00:40:36,538;about which kingdoms
656;00:40:34,457;00:40:36,538;belong to that throne.
657;00:40:36,539;00:40:38,373;I haven't either.
658;00:40:42,915;00:40:43,915;( sighs )
659;00:40:47,706;00:40:51,914;I will allow you to mine the dragonglass
659;00:40:47,706;00:40:51,914;and forge weapons from it.
660;00:40:51,915;00:40:54,915;Any resources or men you need,
660;00:40:51,915;00:40:54,915;I will provide for you.
661;00:40:58,415;00:40:59,415;Thank you.
662;00:41:05,915;00:41:09,581;So you believe me, then, about the
662;00:41:05,915;00:41:09,581;Night King and the Army of the Dead?
663;00:41:12,748;00:41:15,457;You'd better
663;00:41:12,748;00:41:15,457;get to work, Jon Snow.
664;00:41:25,581;00:41:27,457;( chatter )
665;00:41:40,123;00:41:41,747;How much do we have?
666;00:41:41,748;00:41:43,830;4,000 bushels,
666;00:41:41,748;00:41:43,830;my lady.
667;00:41:43,831;00:41:44,997;What does
667;00:41:43,831;00:41:44,997;that mean?
668;00:41:44,998;00:41:47,080;For the current
668;00:41:44,998;00:41:47,080;occupants of the castle,
669;00:41:47,081;00:41:50,747;it's enough food
669;00:41:47,081;00:41:50,747;for a year, perhaps more.
670;00:41:50,748;00:41:54,164;And what's the longest winter
670;00:41:50,748;00:41:54,164;in the past hundred years?
671;00:41:54,165;00:41:56,622;Uh, I'm not
671;00:41:54,165;00:41:56,622;entirely certain.
672;00:41:56,623;00:41:58,456;I-I'll check
672;00:41:56,623;00:41:58,456;Maester Luwin's records.
673;00:41:58,457;00:42:01,955;He kept a copy
673;00:41:58,457;00:42:01,955;of every raven scroll.
674;00:42:01,956;00:42:04,080;You're telling me
674;00:42:01,956;00:42:04,080;we don't have enough food,
675;00:42:04,081;00:42:07,290;especially not if the armies of the North
675;00:42:04,081;00:42:07,290;come back to defend Winterfell?
676;00:42:08,539;00:42:10,788;No, my lady,
676;00:42:08,539;00:42:10,788;most likely not.
677;00:42:10,789;00:42:12,914;Then we must prepare
677;00:42:10,789;00:42:12,914;for that eventuality.
678;00:42:12,915;00:42:14,997;Whatever direction
678;00:42:12,915;00:42:14,997;the threat comes from,
679;00:42:14,998;00:42:17,289;this is
679;00:42:14,998;00:42:17,289;the best place to be.
680;00:42:17,290;00:42:19,247;We need to start
680;00:42:17,290;00:42:19,247;building up our grain stores
681;00:42:19,248;00:42:21,830;with regular shipments
681;00:42:19,248;00:42:21,830;from every keep in the North.
682;00:42:21,831;00:42:24,122;If we don't use it by winter's end,
682;00:42:21,831;00:42:24,122;we'll give it back to them.
683;00:42:24,123;00:42:26,456;But if the entire North
683;00:42:24,123;00:42:26,456;has to flee to Winterfell,
684;00:42:26,457;00:42:30,164;they won't have enough time
684;00:42:26,457;00:42:30,164;to bring wagonloads of grain with them.
685;00:42:30,165;00:42:31,580;Very wise, my lady.
686;00:42:31,581;00:42:33,373;Maester Wolkan,
686;00:42:31,581;00:42:33,373;you'll see to it?
687;00:42:37,165;00:42:39,663;Are they covering those
687;00:42:37,165;00:42:39,663;breastplates in leather?
688;00:42:39,664;00:42:41,039;No, my lady.
689;00:42:41,040;00:42:44,122;Well, shouldn't they be?
689;00:42:41,040;00:42:44,122;Once the real cold comes?
690;00:42:44,123;00:42:45,538;They should, indeed.
691;00:42:45,539;00:42:47,747;Pardon me, my lady.
692;00:42:47,748;00:42:50,332;You there, why isn't there
692;00:42:47,748;00:42:50,332;leather on these?
693;00:42:52,332;00:42:54,123;Command suits you.
694;00:42:55,831;00:42:57,914;The Northerners
694;00:42:55,831;00:42:57,914;are all facing north,
695;00:42:57,915;00:42:59,997;worried about the threat
695;00:42:57,915;00:42:59,997;from beyond the Wall.
696;00:42:59,998;00:43:01,538;So they should be.
697;00:43:01,539;00:43:04,206;I know Cersei
697;00:43:01,539;00:43:04,206;better than anyone here.
698;00:43:04,207;00:43:06,289;If you turn

699;00:43:06,290;00:43:08,036;You don't know Cersei
699;00:43:06,290;00:43:08,036;better than anyone here.
700;00:43:08,060;00:43:10,060;I only meant to say--
701;00:43:10,207;00:43:13,747;That the woman who murdered my mother,
701;00:43:10,207;00:43:13,747;father, and brother is dangerous?

703;00:43:17,123;00:43:19,331;One of two things
703;00:43:17,123;00:43:19,331;will happen--

704;00:43:19,332;00:43:21,622;will defeat the living,
705;00:43:21,623;00:43:23,580;in which case...
706;00:43:23,581;00:43:25,663;all our troubles
706;00:43:23,581;00:43:25,663;come to an end,
707;00:43:25,664;00:43:28,039;or life will win out.
708;00:43:28,040;00:43:30,039;And what then?
709;00:43:30,040;00:43:34,040;Don't fight
709;00:43:30,040;00:43:34,040;in the North or the South.

714;00:43:51,332;00:43:54,914;and nothing will surprise you.

715;00:43:54,915;00:43:57,497;will be something
716;00:43:57,498;00:43:59,415;that you've seen before.

725;00:45:15,498;00:45:18,747;I can never be
725;00:45:15,498;00:45:18,747;Lord of Winterfell.

726;00:45:18,748;00:45:20,580;lord of anything.
727;00:45:20,581;00:45:21,831;I'm the Three-Eyed Raven.
728;00:45:23,915;00:45:25,705;I don't know
728;00:45:23,915;00:45:25,705;what that means.
729;00:45:25,706;00:45:28,122;It's difficult
729;00:45:25,706;00:45:28,122;to explain.
730;00:45:28,123;00:45:30,332;Try.
730;00:45:28,123;00:45:30,332;Please, for me.
731;00:45:32,040;00:45:34,997;It means I can see
731;00:45:32,040;00:45:34,997;everything.
732;00:45:34,998;00:45:37,331;Everything that's
732;00:45:34,998;00:45:37,331;ever happened to everyone.
733;00:45:37,332;00:45:40,331;Everything that's
733;00:45:37,332;00:45:40,331;happening right now.
734;00:45:40,332;00:45:45,122;It's all pieces now,

735;00:45:45,123;00:45:47,331;I need to learn
735;00:45:45,123;00:45:47,331;to see better.

736;00:45:47,332;00:45:50,747;comes again,
737;00:45:50,748;00:45:52,373;I need to be ready.
738;00:45:55,415;00:45:57,830;How do you know
738;00:45:55,415;00:45:57,830;all this?
739;00:45:57,831;00:45:59,372;The Three-Eyed Raven
739;00:45:57,831;00:45:59,372;taught me.
740;00:45:59,373;00:46:01,289;I thought you were
740;00:45:59,373;00:46:01,289;the Three-Eyed Raven.
741;00:46:01,290;00:46:04,039;I told you
741;00:46:01,290;00:46:04,039;it's difficult to explain.

744;00:46:07,706;00:46:10,080;I'm sorry for all
744;00:46:07,706;00:46:10,080;that's happened to you.
745;00:46:10,081;00:46:14,081;I'm sorry it had to happen
745;00:46:10,081;00:46:14,081;here in our home.
746;00:46:19,290;00:46:21,373;It was so beautiful
746;00:46:19,290;00:46:21,373;that night.

748;00:46:30,623;00:46:32,457;so beautiful...
749;00:46:34,415;00:46:36,207;in your white

751;00:46:43,332;00:46:45,040;I'll stay
751;00:46:43,332;00:46:45,040;a bit longer.

754;00:47:08,789;00:47:10,623;Hmm.
755;00:47:16,081;00:47:17,955;Does it hurt?
756;00:47:17,956;00:47:20,664;A bit.
756;00:47:17,956;00:47:20,664;Less than before.
757;00:47:22,457;00:47:25,080;The infection no longer
757;00:47:22,457;00:47:25,080;appears to be active.

759;00:47:26,664;00:47:28,497;Unusual.
760;00:47:28,498;00:47:29,955;Unlikely.
761;00:47:29,956;00:47:31,955;One could almost
761;00:47:29,956;00:47:31,955;be forgiven
762;00:47:31,956;00:47:35,538;for thinking that the entire upper layer
762;00:47:31,956;00:47:35,538;of diseased skin was debrided
763;00:47:35,539;00:47:39,914;and the underlying region
763;00:47:35,539;00:47:39,914;treated with some sort of unguent.
764;00:47:39,915;00:47:43,206;Don't know

765;00:47:43,207;00:47:45,289;feeling better.
766;00:47:45,290;00:47:48,956;I assumed it was
766;00:47:45,290;00:47:48,956;the rest that did it.
767;00:47:50,915;00:47:53,538;And the climate.

770;00:47:57,290;00:47:59,331;for the infectious,

771;00:47:59,332;00:48:01,039;no longer.
772;00:48:01,040;00:48:04,539;Tarly, I'd like to speak with you
772;00:48:01,040;00:48:04,539;in my study this evening.
773;00:48:07,498;00:48:08,789;How bad is it?
774;00:48:10,457;00:48:11,831;Suppose I'll find out
774;00:48:10,457;00:48:11,831;this evening.
775;00:48:16,956;00:48:19,663;Where will you go?

776;00:48:19,664;00:48:23,373;I surrendered to this sickness
776;00:48:19,664;00:48:23,373;the moment I first saw it.
777;00:48:24,831;00:48:27,663;I knew
777;00:48:24,831;00:48:27,663;it would kill me
778;00:48:27,664;00:48:30,331;or I'd kill myself
778;00:48:27,664;00:48:30,331;before it could.
779;00:48:30,332;00:48:33,580;Daenerys Stormborn
779;00:48:30,332;00:48:33,580;convinced me otherwise.
780;00:48:33,581;00:48:37,206;The only place for me
780;00:48:33,581;00:48:37,206;is back with her.
781;00:48:37,207;00:48:39,622;I owe her my life.
782;00:48:39,623;00:48:42,206;Her and you.

784;00:48:44,415;00:48:46,747;Your father saved me
784;00:48:44,415;00:48:46,747;more than once.
785;00:48:46,748;00:48:48,539;It's the least
785;00:48:46,748;00:48:48,539;I could do.
786;00:48:50,040;00:48:53,414;Perhaps our paths
786;00:48:50,040;00:48:53,414;will cross again.
787;00:48:53,415;00:48:54,831;I hope they do.
788;00:49:21,956;00:49:22,941;Ebrose: You treated him?
789;00:49:22,965;00:49:24,418;Yes.
790;00:49:25,415;00:49:27,914;Who told you
790;00:49:25,415;00:49:27,914;to treat him?
791;00:49:27,915;00:49:29,247;No one.
792;00:49:29,248;00:49:32,538;Who forbade you, or anyone,
792;00:49:29,248;00:49:32,538;to attempt to treat him?
793;00:49:32,539;00:49:35,247;I seem
793;00:49:32,539;00:49:35,247;to remember you.
794;00:49:35,248;00:49:38,081;But you treated him anyway?
794;00:49:35,248;00:49:38,081;I did, yes.
795;00:49:39,748;00:49:42,872;I forbade it because it is dangerous
795;00:49:39,748;00:49:42,872;and rarely successful,
796;00:49:42,873;00:49:45,206;especially on
796;00:49:42,873;00:49:45,206;someone of that age.
797;00:49:45,207;00:49:47,414;You could have infected
797;00:49:45,207;00:49:47,414;yourself and others.
798;00:49:47,415;00:49:50,873;You could have devastated

799;00:49:53,165;00:49:55,080;But you didn't.
800;00:49:55,081;00:49:57,705;It's a meticulous,
800;00:49:55,081;00:49:57,705;difficult procedure.
801;00:49:57,706;00:50:01,122;Many maesters whose chains are
801;00:49:57,706;00:50:01,122;heavy with healing links

802;00:50:01,123;00:50:03,580;and failed.
803;00:50:03,581;00:50:05,663;Yet you succeeded.
804;00:50:05,664;00:50:06,789;How?
805;00:50:08,789;00:50:12,081;I read the books
805;00:50:08,789;00:50:12,081;and followed the instructions.

806;00:50:22,457;00:50:24,664;because of you.
807;00:50:26,956;00:50:28,581;You should be proud.

809;00:50:34,165;00:50:35,165;Come here.
810;00:50:39,123;00:50:42,788;All these manuscripts
810;00:50:39,123;00:50:42,788;and scrolls are rotting away.
811;00:50:42,789;00:50:45,457;I need you
811;00:50:42,789;00:50:45,457;to make copies of them.

830;00:51:42,664;00:51:44,456;one arrow.

848;00:52:35,123;00:52:38,248;Tyrion: The gates of Casterly Rock
848;00:52:35,123;00:52:38,248;are impregnable.

850;00:52:45,956;00:52:48,206;The fight up the walls
850;00:52:45,956;00:52:48,206;will be hard.
851;00:52:48,207;00:52:49,748;We will be
851;00:52:48,207;00:52:49,748;at a disadvantage.

852;00:52:51,123;00:52:52,789;Many men will die.
853;00:52:54,956;00:52:56,998;Just as my father
853;00:52:54,956;00:52:56,998;said they would.
854;00:52:59,165;00:53:01,788;Interesting thing
854;00:52:59,165;00:53:01,788;about my father--
855;00:53:01,789;00:53:03,705;he built our house up
855;00:53:01,789;00:53:03,705;from near ruin.
856;00:53:03,706;00:53:07,872;He built our army,
856;00:53:03,706;00:53:07,872;he built Casterly Rock as we know it,
857;00:53:07,873;00:53:09,955;but he didn't
857;00:53:07,873;00:53:09,955;build the sewers.
858;00:53:09,956;00:53:12,039;That was beneath him,
859;00:53:12,040;00:53:14,914;so he gave the job
859;00:53:12,040;00:53:14,914;to the lowest person he could find--
860;00:53:14,915;00:53:16,456;me.
861;00:53:16,457;00:53:18,289;He was right,
861;00:53:16,457;00:53:18,289;I was low.
862;00:53:18,290;00:53:20,414;The company I kept, low.
863;00:53:20,415;00:53:21,955;Women, mostly.
864;00:53:21,956;00:53:23,622;They weren't welcome
864;00:53:21,956;00:53:23,622;at the Rock.
865;00:53:23,623;00:53:25,914;Father disapproved
865;00:53:23,623;00:53:25,914;of that sort of behavior.
866;00:53:25,915;00:53:27,538;Couldn't walk them
866;00:53:25,915;00:53:27,538;through the front gates,
867;00:53:27,539;00:53:28,997;I couldn't have them
867;00:53:27,539;00:53:28,997;in my chambers,
868;00:53:28,998;00:53:31,247;so in the process
868;00:53:28,998;00:53:31,247;of building the sewers,
869;00:53:31,248;00:53:33,998;I threw in something
869;00:53:31,248;00:53:33,998;for myself.
870;00:53:36,040;00:53:38,039;It was a passage
870;00:53:36,040;00:53:38,039;that began
871;00:53:38,040;00:53:39,747;in an out of the way cove
871;00:53:38,040;00:53:39,747;by the sea
872;00:53:39,748;00:53:43,164;and ended beneath
872;00:53:39,748;00:53:43,164;one of the main guard towers.
873;00:53:43,165;00:53:46,373;No better place for low pursuits
873;00:53:43,165;00:53:46,373;than beneath the ground.
874;00:53:47,998;00:53:51,747;Casterly Rock
874;00:53:47,998;00:53:51,747;is an impregnable fortress.
875;00:53:51,748;00:53:53,997;( grunts, wheezes )
876;00:53:53,998;00:53:57,663;But as a good friend of mine
876;00:53:53,998;00:53:57,663;once said,
877;00:53:57,664;00:54:01,622;Give me 10 good men
877;00:53:57,664;00:54:01,622;and I'll impregnate the bitch.
878;00:54:01,623;00:54:04,165;( grunting )
878;00:54:01,623;00:54:04,165;( all shouting )
879;00:54:07,165;00:54:08,373;And so it begins.
880;00:54:15,123;00:54:17,997;They will face the bulk
880;00:54:15,123;00:54:17,997;of the Lannister forces.
881;00:54:17,998;00:54:19,872;They will be outnumbered.
882;00:54:19,873;00:54:22,207;They will have less armor
882;00:54:19,873;00:54:22,207;and fewer weapons.
883;00:54:27,165;00:54:30,955;But my sister's armies
883;00:54:27,165;00:54:30,955;fight for her out of fear.
884;00:54:30,956;00:54:33,914;The Unsullied will be fighting
884;00:54:30,956;00:54:33,914;for something greater.
885;00:54:33,915;00:54:35,914;They will be fighting
885;00:54:33,915;00:54:35,914;for freedom
886;00:54:35,915;00:54:37,705;and the person
886;00:54:35,915;00:54:37,705;who gave it to them.
887;00:54:37,706;00:54:40,206;They will be fighting
887;00:54:37,706;00:54:40,206;for you.
888;00:54:40,207;00:54:42,664;And that is why
888;00:54:40,207;00:54:42,664;they will triumph.
889;00:54:58,664;00:55:00,415;( speaking Valyrian )

893;00:55:30,623;00:55:33,248;of the Lannisters?

897;00:57:02,123;00:57:04,373;It's done.
897;00:57:02,123;00:57:04,373;It is.
898;00:57:06,248;00:57:10,373;And now the rains weep
898;00:57:06,248;00:57:10,373;o'er our halls.
899;00:57:12,706;00:57:14,164;Did we fight well?
900;00:57:14,165;00:57:17,206;Uh, as well
900;00:57:14,165;00:57:17,206;as could be expected.
901;00:57:17,207;00:57:19,331;It was never our forte.
902;00:57:19,332;00:57:21,415;Golden roses, indeed.
903;00:57:23,332;00:57:25,372;Your brother
903;00:57:23,332;00:57:25,372;and his new queen
904;00:57:25,373;00:57:28,289;thought you would be
904;00:57:25,373;00:57:28,289;defending Casterly Rock.
905;00:57:28,290;00:57:31,580;The truth is Casterly Rock
905;00:57:28,290;00:57:31,580;isn't worth much anymore.
906;00:57:31,581;00:57:33,164;Well, it is to me,
907;00:57:33,165;00:57:35,497;but my fond

909;00:57:37,040;00:57:39,164;So you just
909;00:57:37,040;00:57:39,164;let them take it?
910;00:57:39,165;00:57:41,206;For now.
910;00:57:39,165;00:57:41,206;They won't be able to hold it.

911;00:57:41,207;00:57:43,747;burned their ships,

912;00:57:43,748;00:57:45,747;before we left.
913;00:57:45,748;00:57:47,997;Eventually, they'll be forced
913;00:57:45,748;00:57:47,997;to abandon their position
914;00:57:47,998;00:57:51,414;and march all the way
914;00:57:47,998;00:57:51,414;across Westeros.
915;00:57:51,415;00:57:54,580;And you took your army,

916;00:57:54,581;00:57:56,456;and went
916;00:57:54,581;00:57:56,456;where they weren't.
917;00:57:56,457;00:57:59,788;As Robb Stark did to me
917;00:57:56,457;00:57:59,788;at Whispering Wood.
918;00:57:59,789;00:58:01,830;There are always

919;00:58:01,831;00:58:05,415;very wise by now.
920;00:58:06,706;00:58:09,580;My father always said
920;00:58:06,706;00:58:09,580;I was a slow learner.

925;00:58:18,332;00:58:22,247;I suppose I'll be able
925;00:58:18,332;00:58:22,247;to ask him myself soon enough.
926;00:58:22,248;00:58:25,332;No more learning
926;00:58:22,248;00:58:25,332;from my mistakes, eh?
927;00:58:27,789;00:58:30,289;How will you do it?
928;00:58:30,290;00:58:32,747;With that sword?
929;00:58:32,748;00:58:35,122;That was Joffrey's sword,
929;00:58:32,748;00:58:35,122;wasn't it?
930;00:58:35,123;00:58:37,456;Not that
930;00:58:35,123;00:58:37,456;he ever used it.
931;00:58:37,457;00:58:39,123;What did he call it?
932;00:58:40,748;00:58:43,080;Widow's Wail.
933;00:58:43,081;00:58:45,290;He really was a cunt,
933;00:58:43,081;00:58:45,290;wasn't he?
934;00:58:46,915;00:58:52,289;I did unspeakable things
934;00:58:46,915;00:58:52,289;to protect my family.
935;00:58:52,290;00:58:56,331;Or watched them
935;00:58:52,290;00:58:56,331;being done on my orders.
936;00:58:56,332;00:58:59,497;I never lost
936;00:58:56,332;00:58:59,497;a night's sleep over them.
937;00:58:59,498;00:59:01,538;They were necessary.
938;00:59:01,539;00:59:03,580;And whatever
938;00:59:01,539;00:59:03,580;I imagined necessary
939;00:59:03,581;00:59:07,497;for the safety
939;00:59:03,581;00:59:07,497;of House Tyrell, I did.
940;00:59:07,498;00:59:12,123;But your sister
940;00:59:07,498;00:59:12,123;has done things...
941;00:59:13,789;00:59:16,122;I was incapable
941;00:59:13,789;00:59:16,122;of imagining.
942;00:59:16,123;00:59:18,955;That was
942;00:59:16,123;00:59:18,955;my prize mistake--
943;00:59:18,956;00:59:21,498;a failure
943;00:59:18,956;00:59:21,498;of imagination.
944;00:59:22,831;00:59:25,289;She's a monster,
944;00:59:22,831;00:59:25,289;you do know that?
945;00:59:25,290;00:59:27,456;To you, I'm sure.
946;00:59:27,457;00:59:29,331;To others as well.
947;00:59:29,332;00:59:32,830;But after we've won
947;00:59:29,332;00:59:32,830;and there's no one left to oppose us,
948;00:59:32,831;00:59:37,164;when people are living peacefully
948;00:59:32,831;00:59:37,164;in the world she built,
949;00:59:37,165;00:59:40,873;do you really think they'll wring their hands
949;00:59:37,165;00:59:40,873;over the way she built it?
950;00:59:43,290;00:59:45,497;You love her.
951;00:59:45,498;00:59:47,289;You really do
951;00:59:45,498;00:59:47,289;love her.
952;00:59:47,290;00:59:49,747;You poor fool.
953;00:59:49,748;00:59:51,497;She'll be
953;00:59:49,748;00:59:51,497;the end of you.
954;00:59:51,498;00:59:54,039;Possibly.
955;00:59:54,040;00:59:55,830;Not much
955;00:59:54,040;00:59:55,830;to be gained
956;00:59:55,831;00:59:57,872;from discussing it
956;00:59:55,831;00:59:57,872;with you, though, is there?
957;00:59:57,873;01:00:00,580;What better person
957;00:59:57,873;01:00:00,580;to discuss it with?
958;01:00:00,581;01:00:02,497;What better guarantee
958;01:00:00,581;01:00:02,497;could you have
959;01:00:02,498;01:00:06,538;that the things you say
959;01:00:02,498;01:00:06,538;will never leave this room?
960;01:00:06,539;01:00:09,580;But perhaps
960;01:00:06,539;01:00:09,580;you're right.
961;01:00:09,581;01:00:11,164;If she's driven you
961;01:00:09,581;01:00:11,164;this far,
962;01:00:11,165;01:00:13,581;it's gone beyond
962;01:00:11,165;01:00:13,581;your control.
963;01:00:14,873;01:00:16,872;Yes.
964;01:00:16,873;01:00:18,332;It has.
965;01:00:19,415;01:00:21,456;She's a disease.
966;01:00:21,457;01:00:24,414;I regret my role

967;01:00:24,415;01:00:25,997;You will, too.
968;01:00:25,998;01:00:27,748;I think
