2;00:01:49,805;00:01:51,788;My son.
3;00:01:53,198;00:01:55,179;My firstborn son.
4;00:01:58,413;00:02:01,836;My child king, hush.
5;00:02:04,014;00:02:06,699;Listen to the gods,
5;00:02:04,014;00:02:06,699;for you they sing.
6;00:02:10,573;00:02:12,171;Fight no more, sweet child.
7;00:02:12,269;00:02:14,220;Your wars are won.
8;00:02:15,790;00:02:18,060;The wolves are buried
9;00:02:18,158;00:02:20,363;and the false stag done.
10;00:02:24,557;00:02:26,667;Shut your blue eyes, my love.
11;00:02:26,765;00:02:28,235;Let the crown fall.
12;00:02:28,333;00:02:30,827;The Father above
12;00:02:28,333;00:02:30,827;beckons you to his hall.
13;00:02:32,589;00:02:35,563;In Seventh Heaven
13;00:02:32,589;00:02:35,563;I'll see you once more.
14;00:02:39,149;00:02:43,595;But now I seek vengeance
14;00:02:39,149;00:02:43,595;on Sansa the whore
15;00:02:43,693;00:02:46,315;and my brother the Imp
16;00:02:46,413;00:02:49,099;who killed his own king.
17;00:02:49,197;00:02:51,756;Born amongst lions,
17;00:02:49,197;00:02:51,756;our curse from within.
18;00:02:51,853;00:02:54,028;I will slay him, I swear.
19;00:02:54,125;00:02:56,587;With noose or with knife,
20;00:02:56,685;00:02:59,180;though it take me a fortnight,
21;00:02:59,277;00:03:02,668;a moon or my life.
22;00:03:26,222;00:03:28,523;What is that
22;00:03:26,222;00:03:28,523;I hear and smell?
23;00:03:28,621;00:03:31,787;Someone I'll soon send to hell.
24;00:03:31,885;00:03:34,411;It's time to see if truth they told
25;00:03:34,510;00:03:37,228;who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.
26;00:03:37,325;00:03:38,987;Get the wig!
27;00:03:39,085;00:03:42,603;You beast, you beast.
27;00:03:39,085;00:03:42,603;You killed my wife.
28;00:03:42,701;00:03:45,739;And now you've taken
28;00:03:42,701;00:03:45,739;your father's life.
29;00:03:45,837;00:03:48,843;No worse child
29;00:03:45,837;00:03:48,843;ever stained this land.
30;00:03:48,941;00:03:52,043;I curse the day I named you.
31;00:03:54,318;00:03:57,099;My greatest crime!
32;00:04:27,533;00:04:29,163;You're good at that.
33;00:04:29,261;00:04:31,627;Where did you learn?
34;00:04:31,725;00:04:33,291;I'm a jealous woman.
35;00:04:33,389;00:04:35,596;I've always liked bad men
36;00:04:35,693;00:04:37,707;and they've always liked me.
37;00:04:39,469;00:04:42,091;They'd come home wherever
37;00:04:39,469;00:04:42,091;home was that night
38;00:04:42,189;00:04:46,219;stinking of some whore's perfume.
39;00:04:46,317;00:04:49,036;So we'd fight and I'd
39;00:04:46,317;00:04:49,036;put a hole in them.
40;00:04:49,133;00:04:51,755;And then I'd feel terrible,
41;00:04:51,853;00:04:53,739;so I'd patch them up.
42;00:04:53,838;00:04:55,179;I got good at patching them up.
43;00:04:55,277;00:04:56,843;And good at putting holes in them.
44;00:04:56,941;00:04:59,084;And that.
45;00:05:01,805;00:05:03,947;What happened to the actress?
46;00:05:04,045;00:05:07,020;The one who wanted you dead.
47;00:05:07,117;00:05:08,684;Bianca.
48;00:05:08,781;00:05:11,212;She'll have a hard time
48;00:05:08,781;00:05:11,212;finding work as an actress
49;00:05:11,309;00:05:13,259;after what I did to her face.
50;00:05:18,285;00:05:19,435;Mmm.
51;00:05:19,533;00:05:21,515;I never did learn to cook.
52;00:05:21,613;00:05:24,075;But eat.
52;00:05:21,613;00:05:24,075;Eat. You need it.
53;00:05:26,093;00:05:28,843;The company is moving
53;00:05:26,093;00:05:28,843;on to Pentos soon.
54;00:05:28,941;00:05:30,412;You should come with us.
55;00:05:30,509;00:05:32,459;I can't.
55;00:05:30,509;00:05:32,459;Why not?
56;00:05:32,557;00:05:34,891;Got a feeling you'd be
56;00:05:32,557;00:05:34,891;good at this sort of work.
57;00:05:34,989;00:05:36,971;And besides, we need a new actress.
58;00:05:37,069;00:05:40,651;I don't think I could
58;00:05:37,069;00:05:40,651;remember all of the lines.
59;00:05:40,749;00:05:43,051;Come with us.
60;00:05:43,149;00:05:45,035;What's left for you here?
61;00:05:46,157;00:05:48,811;You wouldn't be safe.
62;00:05:48,909;00:05:51,595;Not while she's looking for me.
63;00:05:51,693;00:05:53,739;Who?
64;00:05:53,837;00:05:55,339;She doesn't have a name.
65;00:06:00,781;00:06:02,283;Where will you go?
66;00:06:05,005;00:06:08,395;Essos is east and Westeros is west.
67;00:06:08,493;00:06:10,380;But what's west of Westeros?
68;00:06:11,725;00:06:12,747;I don't know.
69;00:06:12,845;00:06:14,347;Nobody does.
70;00:06:14,445;00:06:16,459;That's where all the maps stop.
71;00:06:16,557;00:06:18,411;The edge of the world, maybe.
72;00:06:18,509;00:06:19,755;I'd like to see that.
73;00:06:30,221;00:06:32,299;What's that?
73;00:06:30,221;00:06:32,299;Milk of the poppy.
74;00:06:32,397;00:06:33,899;I don't want any.
75;00:06:35,981;00:06:38,987;Sleep is the only way you'll heal.
76;00:06:39,085;00:06:42,763;Trust me, if my soup didn't
76;00:06:39,085;00:06:42,763;kill you, nothing will.
77;00:07:23,373;00:07:26,603;Thing about Gatins, right,
77;00:07:23,373;00:07:26,603;is he used to be pretty.
78;00:07:26,701;00:07:27,979;I was a famous kisser.
79;00:07:28,077;00:07:30,539;You lads know how to kiss proper?
80;00:07:32,493;00:07:33,579;Course we do.
81;00:07:33,677;00:07:36,107;This is for masters, this technique.
82;00:07:36,205;00:07:37,963;You're not ready.
82;00:07:36,205;00:07:37,963;I'm ready.
83;00:07:38,061;00:07:40,363;He says he's ready.
84;00:07:40,461;00:07:43,339;All right.
84;00:07:40,461;00:07:43,339;Now, pay attention.
85;00:07:45,709;00:07:49,195;You put your left hand on the
85;00:07:45,709;00:07:49,195;back of the lady's head.
86;00:07:49,293;00:07:52,459;Your right hand holds the small
86;00:07:49,293;00:07:52,459;of the lady's back like so.
87;00:07:53,581;00:07:54,859;Very romantic.
88;00:07:54,957;00:07:57,835;Take your middle finger, yeah,
89;00:07:57,933;00:07:59,947;and you jam it right up her bunghole.
90;00:08:02,829;00:08:04,171;So fucking close!
91;00:08:04,269;00:08:06,795;Ah, it smells like pussy to me.
92;00:08:06,893;00:08:08,427;Look at him.
92;00:08:06,893;00:08:08,427;You get hard, boy?
93;00:08:08,525;00:08:11,467;Fuck you!
93;00:08:08,525;00:08:11,467;Disgusting old twats.
94;00:08:15,053;00:08:17,675;Got off on that,
94;00:08:15,053;00:08:17,675;did you, you old fuck?
95;00:08:38,701;00:08:40,171;Where's the other one?
96;00:08:40,269;00:08:42,699;The one with the yellow cloak.
96;00:08:40,269;00:08:42,699;Fuck you!
97;00:08:42,797;00:08:45,003;Those are your last words, fuck you?
98;00:08:45,100;00:08:46,891;Come on, you can do better.
99;00:08:46,989;00:08:48,299;Cunt!
100;00:08:48,397;00:08:50,763;You're shit at dying, you know that?
101;00:09:05,421;00:09:09,067;_
102;00:09:09,302;00:09:12,718;_
103;00:09:14,132;00:09:18,402;_
104;00:09:18,847;00:09:21,887;_
105;00:09:23,756;00:09:25,515;I'd call that a successful gambit.
106;00:09:25,613;00:09:27,339;Would you?
106;00:09:25,613;00:09:27,339;Look around.
107;00:09:27,437;00:09:29,451;The city has come back to life.
108;00:09:29,549;00:09:33,067;You made a pact with fanatics.
108;00:09:29,549;00:09:33,067;I did and it worked.
109;00:09:33,165;00:09:36,779;If you shaved your beard with a straight
109;00:09:33,165;00:09:36,779;razor, you'd say the razor worked.
110;00:09:36,877;00:09:38,955;That doesn't mean
110;00:09:36,877;00:09:38,955;it won't cut your throat.
111;00:09:39,053;00:09:42,155;Spoken like a man who has
111;00:09:39,053;00:09:42,155;never had to shave.
112;00:09:46,701;00:09:48,363;I'm going to miss you.
113;00:09:48,460;00:09:49,995;I know.
114;00:09:50,093;00:09:52,971;I hope you're right about
114;00:09:50,093;00:09:52,971;this expedition of yours.
115;00:09:53,069;00:09:56,203;If I don't return,
115;00:09:53,069;00:09:56,203;you'll know I was wrong.
116;00:09:59,821;00:10:01,483;We need friends in Westeros.
117;00:10:01,581;00:10:03,083;And we need ships.
118;00:10:03,181;00:10:04,651;Most of all, we need our queen.
119;00:10:04,749;00:10:08,075;She'll come back.
119;00:10:04,749;00:10:08,075;She has to.
120;00:10:08,173;00:10:10,763;My heart's been broken
120;00:10:08,173;00:10:10,763;too many times already.
121;00:10:12,749;00:10:15,115;I'll walk the rest of the way myself.
122;00:10:15,213;00:10:16,747;I can't go off on a secret mission
123;00:10:16,845;00:10:19,339;in the company of the most
123;00:10:16,845;00:10:19,339;famous dwarf in the city.
124;00:10:22,797;00:10:24,971;Varys.
125;00:10:25,069;00:10:27,947;The most famous dwarf in the world.
126;00:10:54,956;00:10:57,291;Your Grace, several members
126;00:10:54,956;00:10:57,291;of the Faith Militant
127;00:10:57,389;00:10:59,947;have been permitted
127;00:10:57,389;00:10:59,947;entry to the Red Keep.
128;00:11:00,045;00:11:02,187;Have been permitted?
129;00:11:02,284;00:11:04,331;That's rather a tortured
129;00:11:02,284;00:11:04,331;way of putting it.
130;00:11:04,429;00:11:06,859;They demand to see you, Your Grace.
131;00:11:06,957;00:11:08,907;Who permitted them
131;00:11:06,957;00:11:08,907;inside the Red Keep?
132;00:11:12,269;00:11:14,219;The king is aware of their presence?
133;00:11:14,317;00:11:15,691;He is, Your Grace.
134;00:11:15,789;00:11:18,379;He's currently in his
134;00:11:15,789;00:11:18,379;chambers at prayer.
135;00:11:33,260;00:11:35,370;Your Grace, His Holiness
135;00:11:33,260;00:11:35,370;the High Septon
136;00:11:35,469;00:11:38,059;wishes to speak with you at
136;00:11:35,469;00:11:38,059;the Great Sept of Baelor.
137;00:11:38,156;00:11:39,722;His Holiness the High Septon
138;00:11:39,820;00:11:42,571;is welcome to see me
138;00:11:39,820;00:11:42,571;here in the Red Keep.
139;00:11:42,669;00:11:45,035;Your Grace, this is not a request.
140;00:11:45,132;00:11:47,242;It is a request, Cousin Lancel.
141;00:11:47,341;00:11:49,835;You are asking me for
141;00:11:47,341;00:11:49,835;something, I'm refusing.
142;00:11:51,565;00:11:54,570;The High Septon commands you.
143;00:11:54,669;00:11:56,683;Are you sure you want to refuse him?
144;00:11:58,924;00:12:01,867;He promised me I could stay in
144;00:11:58,924;00:12:01,867;the Red Keep until my trial.
145;00:12:01,965;00:12:03,818;He made no such promises.
146;00:12:03,917;00:12:05,857;If you refuse to come of your
146;00:12:03,917;00:12:05,857;own free will...
147;00:12:05,972;00:12:07,047;Get out.
148;00:12:16,460;00:12:17,995;Move aside, ser.
149;00:12:21,133;00:12:23,947;Order your man to step aside
149;00:12:21,133;00:12:23,947;or there will be violence.
150;00:12:31,245;00:12:32,843;I choose violence.
151;00:13:12,365;00:13:15,755;Please tell His High Holiness
151;00:13:12,365;00:13:15,755;he's always welcome to visit.
152;00:13:26,861;00:13:29,035;Looks like a siege, my lady.
153;00:13:29,133;00:13:32,363;You have a keen military mind, Pod.
154;00:13:41,165;00:13:43,723;My lady.
154;00:13:41,165;00:13:43,723;My lady.
155;00:13:46,956;00:13:49,195;Who goes there?!
156;00:13:49,293;00:13:50,475;State your business!
157;00:13:50,573;00:13:52,523;My name is Brienne of Tarth.
158;00:13:52,620;00:13:56,298;Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister
158;00:13:52,620;00:13:56,298;I've come to speak with him.
159;00:13:58,157;00:14:01,003;Tell him I have his sword.
160;00:14:11,725;00:14:13,899;Getting a bit old
160;00:14:11,725;00:14:13,899;to be a squire, aren't we?
161;00:14:19,117;00:14:20,331;Podrick fucking Payne.
162;00:14:20,429;00:14:22,922;I thought you'd be dead by now.
163;00:14:23,020;00:14:24,363;Not yet.
164;00:14:25,997;00:14:27,978;Are they in there?
164;00:14:25,997;00:14:27,978;Uh-huh.
165;00:14:31,693;00:14:33,707;You think they're fucking?
166;00:14:33,805;00:14:35,275;What?
167;00:14:35,373;00:14:36,907;No.
168;00:14:37,005;00:14:39,754;Why not?
168;00:14:37,005;00:14:39,754;I'd fuck her.
169;00:14:39,852;00:14:41,418;You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?
170;00:14:41,516;00:14:43,723;I'm her squire.
170;00:14:41,516;00:14:43,723;Oh.
171;00:14:43,821;00:14:46,891;Well, he'd
171;00:14:43,821;00:14:46,891;fuck her, that's for sure.
172;00:14:46,988;00:14:48,875;And she'd fuck him, don't you think?
173;00:14:48,973;00:14:50,731;The way she looks at him.
174;00:14:50,828;00:14:53,227;The way all women look at
174;00:14:50,828;00:14:53,227;him is frankly irritating.
175;00:14:53,325;00:14:56,299;I preferred working with the
175;00:14:53,325;00:14:56,299;little brother on that account.
176;00:14:56,397;00:14:59,979;Come on, you're the one
176;00:14:56,397;00:14:59,979;with the magic cock.
177;00:15:01,324;00:15:03,338;You must have shown it to her by now.
178;00:15:05,293;00:15:07,882;She's training me to fight.
178;00:15:05,293;00:15:07,882;Is she?
179;00:15:07,981;00:15:10,314;Oh.
179;00:15:07,981;00:15:10,314;An hour in the morning, an hour at night.
180;00:15:10,412;00:15:12,138;Every day.
181;00:15:12,236;00:15:15,882;Then how come an old cunt like me
181;00:15:12,236;00:15:15,882;can still sneak up and murder you?
182;00:15:15,980;00:15:18,410;Well, that's a different
182;00:15:15,980;00:15:18,410;sort of fighting.
183;00:15:18,508;00:15:20,043;Now, that's the truth, isn't it?
184;00:15:20,141;00:15:22,602;You want to learn
184;00:15:20,141;00:15:22,602;that sort of fighting?
185;00:15:23,916;00:15:25,674;All right.
186;00:15:25,772;00:15:27,946;All right, let's start
186;00:15:25,772;00:15:27,946;with your footwork.
187;00:15:28,044;00:15:30,155;Show me your stance.
188;00:15:31,532;00:15:33,035;Now listen to me, Pod.
189;00:15:33,133;00:15:35,690;See how your feet
189;00:15:33,133;00:15:35,690;are about a yard apart?
190;00:15:35,788;00:15:38,475;Lesson number one, assume
190;00:15:35,788;00:15:38,475;everyone wants to hit you.
191;00:15:38,572;00:15:42,506;'Cause they do, Pod. Everyone
191;00:15:38,572;00:15:42,506;wants to hit a fucking squire.
192;00:15:42,604;00:15:45,099;Do it again.
192;00:15:42,604;00:15:45,099;Come on, don't sulk.
193;00:15:45,196;00:15:46,731;I never thought
193;00:15:45,196;00:15:46,731;you'd find her.
194;00:15:46,829;00:15:48,202;I just assumed Sansa was dead.
195;00:15:48,301;00:15:50,315;Why would you assume that?
196;00:15:50,413;00:15:54,186;In my experience, girls like
196;00:15:50,413;00:15:54,186;her don't live very long.
197;00:15:54,284;00:15:56,810;I don't think you know
197;00:15:54,284;00:15:56,810;many girls like her.
198;00:15:56,908;00:15:59,722;Well, I'm proud of you.
199;00:15:59,821;00:16:02,314;I am. You fulfilled your
199;00:15:59,821;00:16:02,314;oath to Catelyn Stark
200;00:16:02,412;00:16:04,107;against all odds.
201;00:16:04,205;00:16:07,050;Of course, my sister
201;00:16:04,205;00:16:07,050;wants Sansa dead.
202;00:16:07,149;00:16:09,642;The girl is still a suspect
202;00:16:07,149;00:16:09,642;in Joffrey's murder,
203;00:16:09,740;00:16:13,322;so there is that complication.
204;00:16:15,021;00:16:16,287;What the hell are you doing here?
205;00:16:16,333;00:16:17,995;I've come for the Blackfish.
206;00:16:18,092;00:16:19,819;You're welcome to have him.
207;00:16:19,917;00:16:23,530;Lady Sansa desires to take her
207;00:16:19,917;00:16:23,530;ancestral seat back from the Boltons
208;00:16:23,628;00:16:26,666;and assume her rightful
208;00:16:23,628;00:16:26,666;position as Lady of Winterfell.
209;00:16:26,764;00:16:29,706;With what army does she
209;00:16:26,764;00:16:29,706;plan on taking Winterfell?
210;00:16:29,804;00:16:31,114;The Tully army.
211;00:16:31,212;00:16:32,874;They're a bit occupied at the moment.
212;00:16:32,972;00:16:34,571;I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun
213;00:16:34,669;00:16:36,331;currently defended
213;00:16:34,669;00:16:36,331;by the Tully rebels,
214;00:16:36,428;00:16:38,059;so you can see the conundrum.
215;00:16:38,157;00:16:40,171;The Tullys are rebels because
215;00:16:38,157;00:16:40,171;they're fighting for their home?
216;00:16:40,268;00:16:42,603;Riverrun was granted to
216;00:16:40,268;00:16:42,603;the Freys by royal decree.
217;00:16:42,700;00:16:46,058;As a reward for betraying Robb
217;00:16:42,700;00:16:46,058;Stark and slaughtering his family.
218;00:16:46,157;00:16:47,499;Exactly.
219;00:16:51,309;00:16:52,907;We shouldn't argue about politics.
220;00:16:53,004;00:16:55,626;You're a knight, Ser Jaime.
221;00:16:55,724;00:16:57,611;I know there is honor in you.
222;00:16:57,708;00:17:00,362;I've seen it myself.
222;00:16:57,708;00:17:00,362;I'm a Lannister.
223;00:17:00,460;00:17:02,282;Don't ask me to betray my own house.
224;00:17:02,380;00:17:04,554;I do no such thing.
225;00:17:04,652;00:17:07,115;Take Riverrun without bloodshed.
226;00:17:07,213;00:17:10,603;Ride south again with your mission
226;00:17:07,213;00:17:10,603;complete and your army intact.
227;00:17:10,701;00:17:12,234;What do you propose?
228;00:17:12,332;00:17:15,851;Allow me to enter Riverrun
228;00:17:12,332;00:17:15,851;under a flag of truce.
229;00:17:15,948;00:17:18,268;Let me try to persuade the
229;00:17:15,948;00:17:18,268;Blackfish to give up the castle.
230;00:17:18,285;00:17:20,203;Why would he abandon
230;00:17:18,285;00:17:20,203;his ancestral home?
231;00:17:20,301;00:17:23,754;Because you'll allow him to lead
231;00:17:20,301;00:17:23,754;the Tully forces safely north.
232;00:17:26,636;00:17:28,427;Have you ever met the Blackfish?
233;00:17:30,413;00:17:33,131;No.
233;00:17:30,413;00:17:33,131;He's even more stubborn than you are.
234;00:17:33,228;00:17:35,211;All right.
235;00:17:35,309;00:17:37,610;Try to talk some sense
235;00:17:35,309;00:17:37,610;into the old goat.
236;00:17:37,708;00:17:39,915;He won't listen, but his men might.
237;00:17:40,013;00:17:42,379;Not everybody wants to die
237;00:17:40,013;00:17:42,379;for someone else's home.
238;00:17:42,476;00:17:44,426;I need your word.
239;00:17:45,740;00:17:47,531;If I persuade him
239;00:17:45,740;00:17:47,531;to abandon the castle,
240;00:17:47,628;00:17:49,963;you'll grant a safe passage north.
241;00:17:50,061;00:17:52,170;You have my word.
242;00:17:52,268;00:17:54,122;You have until nightfall.
243;00:18:10,348;00:18:12,907;You gave it to me for a purpose.
244;00:18:13,005;00:18:16,075;I've achieved that purpose.
245;00:18:18,765;00:18:20,362;It's yours.
246;00:18:22,028;00:18:23,946;It will always be yours.
247;00:18:32,876;00:18:34,794;One last thing, Ser Jaime.
248;00:18:34,892;00:18:36,938;Yes, Lady Brienne?
249;00:18:37,036;00:18:40,810;Should I fail to persuade
249;00:18:37,036;00:18:40,810;the Blackfish to surrender
250;00:18:40,908;00:18:43,658;and if you attack the castle,
251;00:18:43,756;00:18:46,666;honor compels me
251;00:18:43,756;00:18:46,666;to fight for Sansa's kin.
252;00:18:46,764;00:18:48,746;Of course it does.
253;00:18:48,844;00:18:50,283;To fight you.
254;00:18:54,604;00:18:56,682;Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
255;00:19:06,509;00:19:08,458;I've said no
255;00:19:06,509;00:19:08,458;three times already.
256;00:19:08,556;00:19:10,699;I have a signed letter
256;00:19:08,556;00:19:10,699;from your niece Sansa Stark.
257;00:19:10,796;00:19:12,523;I haven't seen her
257;00:19:10,796;00:19:12,523;since she was a child.
258;00:19:12,620;00:19:14,699;I don't know her signature.
258;00:19:12,620;00:19:14,699;I don't know you.
259;00:19:14,797;00:19:18,123;And I will not surrender.
259;00:19:14,797;00:19:18,123;Double the guards tonight.
260;00:19:19,468;00:19:21,611;The Kingslayer wants to try us.
261;00:19:21,708;00:19:23,562;I can feel it.
262;00:19:24,620;00:19:26,122;As I have said, my name is...
263;00:19:26,221;00:19:28,554;Yes, Brienne of Tarth.
263;00:19:26,221;00:19:28,554;I know your father.
264;00:19:28,652;00:19:30,378;Good man.
264;00:19:28,652;00:19:30,378;He always spoke highly of you.
265;00:19:30,476;00:19:33,066;And if he were here now, I'd tell
265;00:19:30,476;00:19:33,066;him the same I'm telling you.
266;00:19:33,164;00:19:35,498;If you think I'm abandoning
266;00:19:33,164;00:19:35,498;my family's seat
267;00:19:35,596;00:19:37,802;on the Kingslayer's word of
267;00:19:35,596;00:19:37,802;honor, you're a bloody fool.
268;00:19:37,900;00:19:40,459;Riverrun cannot stand against
268;00:19:37,900;00:19:40,459;the Lannisters and the Freys.
269;00:19:40,556;00:19:44,010;We can stand longer than your
269;00:19:40,556;00:19:44,010;one-handed friend thinks we can.
270;00:19:44,109;00:19:46,442;He's not my friend.
270;00:19:44,109;00:19:46,442;No?
271;00:19:48,140;00:19:50,986;Who gave you permission to cross the
271;00:19:48,140;00:19:50,986;siege line and enter the castle?
272;00:19:51,084;00:19:53,738;Who gave you that sword with
272;00:19:51,084;00:19:53,738;the gold lion on the pommel?
273;00:19:53,836;00:19:57,482;Ser Jaime kept his word
273;00:19:53,836;00:19:57,482;to your niece Catelyn Stark.
274;00:19:57,580;00:20:00,682;He sent me to find Sansa,
274;00:19:57,580;00:20:00,682;to help her as Catelyn wanted.
275;00:20:00,781;00:20:02,795;He gave me this sword to protect her.
276;00:20:02,892;00:20:05,450;That is what I have done
276;00:20:02,892;00:20:05,450;and I will continue to do
277;00:20:05,548;00:20:07,755;until the day I die.
278;00:20:20,364;00:20:22,603;She's exactly like her mother.
279;00:20:28,652;00:20:31,562;I don't have enough men to
279;00:20:28,652;00:20:31,562;help her take Winterfell.
280;00:20:31,660;00:20:33,642;You have more than she does.
281;00:20:33,740;00:20:36,170;She wants her home back.
281;00:20:33,740;00:20:36,170;I understand that.
282;00:20:36,268;00:20:38,058;But this is my home.
283;00:20:38,156;00:20:40,042;And if Jaime Lannister wants it,
284;00:20:40,141;00:20:43,594;he can bloody well take it
284;00:20:40,141;00:20:43,594;the way everyone else does.
285;00:20:59,660;00:21:02,250;Find the maester.
286;00:21:02,348;00:21:04,938;We need to get a raven
286;00:21:02,348;00:21:04,938;north to Sansa.
287;00:21:06,636;00:21:08,298;What should I write?
288;00:21:10,988;00:21:12,779;Tell her I failed.
289;00:21:42,348;00:21:43,882;There's to be a royal announcement?
290;00:21:43,980;00:21:45,866;There is.
291;00:21:45,964;00:21:47,498;Why wasn't I informed?
292;00:21:49,388;00:21:52,362;There is to be a royal announcement
293;00:21:52,460;00:21:54,346;in the throne room
294;00:21:54,444;00:21:56,362;at this very moment.
295;00:21:59,244;00:22:01,194;Where are you going?
296;00:22:03,980;00:22:05,962;To stand by my son.
297;00:22:06,060;00:22:08,618;Your place is in the gallery
298;00:22:08,717;00:22:11,274;with the other ladies of the court.
299;00:22:18,668;00:22:20,235;Your Grace...
300;00:22:37,517;00:22:39,754;Lords and ladies,
301;00:22:39,852;00:22:42,378;the Faith and the Crown
302;00:22:42,476;00:22:45,578;are the two pillars
302;00:22:42,476;00:22:45,578;that hold up this world.
303;00:22:45,676;00:22:49,162;One collapses, so does the other.
304;00:22:50,668;00:22:53,066;The Father judges us all.
305;00:22:53,164;00:22:54,539;If you break his laws...
306;00:22:57,292;00:22:59,466;you will be punished.
307;00:23:01,164;00:23:04,810;After conferring with His
307;00:23:01,164;00:23:04,810;Holiness the High Septon,
308;00:23:04,908;00:23:07,146;we have determined that Loras Tyrell
309;00:23:07,244;00:23:08,874;and Cersei Lannister's trial
310;00:23:08,972;00:23:10,954;will be held in
310;00:23:08,972;00:23:10,954;the Great Sept of Baelor
311;00:23:11,052;00:23:13,450;on the first day of the
311;00:23:11,052;00:23:13,450;Festival of the Mother.
312;00:23:19,564;00:23:22,442;Furthermore, after much prayer
313;00:23:22,540;00:23:24,522;and reflection,
314;00:23:24,620;00:23:27,594;the Crown has decided
314;00:23:24,620;00:23:27,594;that from this day forward,
315;00:23:27,692;00:23:29,578;trial by combat will be forbidden
316;00:23:29,676;00:23:31,627;throughout the Seven Kingdoms.
317;00:23:33,388;00:23:35,498;The tradition
317;00:23:33,388;00:23:35,498;is a brutish one,
318;00:23:35,596;00:23:37,482;a scheme devised by corrupt rulers
319;00:23:37,580;00:23:40,106;in order to avoid
319;00:23:37,580;00:23:40,106;true judgment from the gods.
320;00:23:40,204;00:23:42,602;Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell
321;00:23:42,700;00:23:44,586;will stand trial before seven septons
322;00:23:44,684;00:23:47,370;as it was in the earliest
322;00:23:44,684;00:23:47,370;days of the Faith.
323;00:23:47,468;00:23:49,515;Seven blessings to all.
324;00:23:49,612;00:23:51,402;Seven blessings.
325;00:24:12,876;00:24:15,242;Your Grace...
326;00:24:15,340;00:24:18,666;that old rumor you told me about.
327;00:24:20,236;00:24:22,506;My little birds investigated.
328;00:24:24,300;00:24:26,922;And?
329;00:24:27,020;00:24:29,994;Was it just a rumor
329;00:24:27,020;00:24:29,994;or something more?
330;00:24:30,092;00:24:31,658;More.
331;00:24:33,804;00:24:35,338;Much more.
332;00:24:41,068;00:24:43,178;You seem happy.
333;00:24:43,276;00:24:45,034;I am happy.
334;00:24:46,220;00:24:47,978;You should both be happy as well.
335;00:24:48,076;00:24:52,266;Not so long ago, this city
335;00:24:48,076;00:24:52,266;was ready to devour itself.
336;00:24:52,364;00:24:54,698;Now it's like a man reborn.
337;00:24:54,796;00:24:56,810;I will be happy
337;00:24:54,796;00:24:56,810;when our queen returns.
338;00:24:56,908;00:25:00,426;Why don't you drink? Why don't
338;00:24:56,908;00:25:00,426;either of you ever drink?
339;00:25:00,524;00:25:01,802;Unsullied never drink.
340;00:25:01,900;00:25:03,114;Why not?
340;00:25:01,900;00:25:03,114;Rules.
341;00:25:03,212;00:25:05,418;And who made these rules?
342;00:25:05,516;00:25:07,338;Your former masters?
343;00:25:07,436;00:25:10,378;Those miserable old shits
343;00:25:07,436;00:25:10,378;didn't want you to be human.
344;00:25:10,476;00:25:12,458;Have a drink with me.
345;00:25:15,308;00:25:18,442;And you?
345;00:25:15,308;00:25:18,442;What's your excuse?
346;00:25:19,436;00:25:20,874;I have tried wine before.
347;00:25:20,971;00:25:22,698;It made me feel funny.
348;00:25:22,796;00:25:24,682;That's how you know it's working.
349;00:25:27,052;00:25:29,450;Here's to our queen.
350;00:25:29,548;00:25:32,682;Anyone not drinking
350;00:25:29,548;00:25:32,682;is disrespecting our queen.
351;00:25:35,788;00:25:37,898;To Daenerys Stormborn,
351;00:25:35,788;00:25:37,898;Mother of Dragons,
352;00:25:37,996;00:25:40,586;Breaker of Chains,
352;00:25:37,996;00:25:40,586;long may she reign.
353;00:25:40,684;00:25:42,794;Long may she reign.
353;00:25:40,684;00:25:42,794;Long may she reign.
354;00:25:48,300;00:25:49,770;Do you like it?
355;00:25:49,868;00:25:51,818;Tastes like it has turned.
356;00:25:51,916;00:25:55,018;Yes, yes.
356;00:25:51,916;00:25:55,018;Fermentation.
357;00:25:58,444;00:26:02,858;One day, after our queen has
357;00:25:58,444;00:26:02,858;taken the Seven Kingdoms...
358;00:26:04,523;00:26:06,666;I'd like to have my own vineyard.
359;00:26:07,915;00:26:10,442;Make my own wine.
360;00:26:10,539;00:26:12,938;The Imp's Delight.
361;00:26:13,036;00:26:15,402;Only my close friends could drink it.
362;00:26:18,860;00:26:21,322;Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.
363;00:26:21,420;00:26:23,882;I do not know any jokes.
364;00:26:23,979;00:26:25,066;Grey Worm?
365;00:26:27,532;00:26:29,194;Right.
366;00:26:30,988;00:26:33,866;Three lords
366;00:26:30,988;00:26:33,866;walk into a tavern...
367;00:26:33,964;00:26:36,362;a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.
368;00:26:36,459;00:26:37,898;They order ale,
369;00:26:37,996;00:26:40,394;but when the barkeep
369;00:26:37,996;00:26:40,394;brings them over,
370;00:26:40,492;00:26:42,890;each of them finds a fly in his cup.
371;00:26:42,988;00:26:47,146;The Lannister, outraged, shoves the
371;00:26:42,988;00:26:47,146;cup aside and demands another.
372;00:26:47,244;00:26:51,242;The Martell plucks the fly
372;00:26:47,244;00:26:51,242;out and swallows it whole.
373;00:26:52,236;00:26:55,786;The Stark reaches into his cup,
374;00:26:55,884;00:26:58,570;pulls out the fly and shouts,
375;00:26:58,668;00:27:01,130;Spit it out, you wee shit.
376;00:27:01,228;00:27:02,506;Spit it out.
377;00:27:08,076;00:27:10,314;It's funnier in Westeros.
378;00:27:10,411;00:27:13,482;The Starks and the Lannisters,
378;00:27:10,411;00:27:13,482;I thought these were enemies.
379;00:27:13,580;00:27:14,580;Yes.
380;00:27:14,668;00:27:18,154;A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho.
381;00:27:18,251;00:27:20,298;Not a true story, necessarily.
382;00:27:20,396;00:27:23,274;A story that's supposed
382;00:27:20,396;00:27:23,274;to make you laugh ideally.
383;00:27:23,372;00:27:25,098;Not at the moment, perhaps.
384;00:27:25,196;00:27:27,498;Missandei, do you like the wine?
385;00:27:27,595;00:27:28,970;I do.
386;00:27:29,068;00:27:30,346;Tell a joke.
387;00:27:36,140;00:27:38,857;Two translators
387;00:27:36,140;00:27:38,857;are on a sinking ship.
388;00:27:40,523;00:27:42,410;The first says,
389;00:27:42,508;00:27:44,778;Do you know
389;00:27:42,508;00:27:44,778;how to swim?
390;00:27:44,875;00:27:49,161;The second says, No, but I can
390;00:27:44,875;00:27:49,161;shout for help in 19 languages.
391;00:27:52,076;00:27:54,538;Ah!
392;00:27:57,868;00:27:59,882;That is the worst joke I ever heard.
393;00:27:59,979;00:28:01,578;You don't even know what a joke is.
394;00:28:01,676;00:28:04,458;I am soldier all my life.
394;00:28:01,676;00:28:04,458;You think I never hear joke?
395;00:28:04,556;00:28:06,826;You lied to us.
396;00:28:08,332;00:28:09,642;I make joke.
397;00:28:19,820;00:28:21,130;More jokes.
398;00:28:21,228;00:28:23,498;I once walked into a brothel
399;00:28:23,596;00:28:25,162;with a honeycomb and a jackass.
400;00:28:25,260;00:28:27,817;The madam says...
401;00:28:39,564;00:28:42,121;The Masters have come
401;00:28:39,564;00:28:42,121;for their property.
402;00:28:59,468;00:29:00,778;Lord Edmure.
403;00:29:02,572;00:29:05,001;I apologize for the way
403;00:29:02,572;00:29:05,001;the Freys treated you.
404;00:29:05,100;00:29:07,274;A man of your birth deserves better.
405;00:29:07,372;00:29:11,177;You have my word you'll be properly
405;00:29:07,372;00:29:11,177;fed and clothed from now on.
406;00:29:13,099;00:29:14,986;I have your word?
407;00:29:17,100;00:29:19,401;Oh, good.
408;00:29:19,500;00:29:21,450;Good, that's...
409;00:29:21,548;00:29:23,434;that's a fine thing.
410;00:29:25,132;00:29:27,978;My uncle will never
410;00:29:25,132;00:29:27,978;surrender the castle, ser.
411;00:29:28,076;00:29:29,961;Whatever game you're playing.
412;00:29:30,060;00:29:31,850;The Blackfish is an old man.
413;00:29:31,947;00:29:33,961;A good death is all he can hope for.
414;00:29:34,059;00:29:37,002;But you, you have a
414;00:29:34,059;00:29:37,002;child now, I've heard.
415;00:29:38,380;00:29:40,777;A son you sired
415;00:29:38,380;00:29:40,777;on your wedding night.
416;00:29:40,876;00:29:42,601;You're a potent man.
417;00:29:42,699;00:29:44,938;A son I've never met
418;00:29:45,035;00:29:47,657;born of a wife that I haven't seen
419;00:29:47,755;00:29:49,034;since our first night together.
420;00:29:49,132;00:29:50,602;You should be with them both.
421;00:29:51,755;00:29:53,834;I can arrange that, you realize?
422;00:29:53,931;00:29:55,881;Comfortable rooms for you
422;00:29:53,931;00:29:55,881;at Casterly Rock.
423;00:29:55,980;00:29:59,050;A tutor for your boy, knights to
423;00:29:55,980;00:29:59,050;train him to fight and to ride.
424;00:29:59,148;00:30:01,482;And when he comes of age,
424;00:29:59,148;00:30:01,482;he'll have a keep of his own.
425;00:30:01,580;00:30:03,914;Do you imagine yourself
425;00:30:01,580;00:30:03,914;a decent person?
426;00:30:04,012;00:30:06,441;Is that it?
427;00:30:06,540;00:30:09,833;After you've massacred my family.
428;00:30:11,180;00:30:12,906;Kept me in a cell for years.
429;00:30:13,004;00:30:14,889;Stolen our lands.
430;00:30:14,987;00:30:17,450;I'll remind you that
430;00:30:14,987;00:30:17,450;our houses are at war.
431;00:30:17,548;00:30:19,593;I'm sorry if this conflict
431;00:30:17,548;00:30:19,593;has inconvenienced you,
432;00:30:19,691;00:30:22,090;but rebelling against the
432;00:30:19,691;00:30:22,090;Crown does have consequences.
433;00:30:22,188;00:30:24,336;Says the man who shoved his
433;00:30:22,188;00:30:24,336;sword through his king's back.
434;00:30:24,395;00:30:27,082;Did I give you the impression
434;00:30:24,395;00:30:27,082;that this was a negotiation?
435;00:30:27,179;00:30:28,362;It's not.
436;00:30:30,763;00:30:33,546;You understand. On some
436;00:30:30,763;00:30:33,546;level you understand
437;00:30:33,643;00:30:35,497;that you're an evil man.
438;00:30:35,596;00:30:37,161;I'll leave the judgments to the gods.
439;00:30:37,260;00:30:39,466;Well, that is convenient for you.
440;00:30:42,635;00:30:46,090;You're a fine-looking
440;00:30:42,635;00:30:46,090;fellow, aren't you?
441;00:30:48,587;00:30:51,050;Your square jaw,
442;00:30:51,148;00:30:52,841;your golden armor.
443;00:30:54,443;00:30:57,418;Tell me, I want to know.
444;00:30:57,516;00:30:59,018;I truly do.
445;00:30:59,116;00:31:00,521;How do you live with yourself?
446;00:31:04,107;00:31:06,154;All of us have to believe
447;00:31:06,252;00:31:09,130;that we're decent, don't we?
448;00:31:09,228;00:31:12,266;You have to sleep at night.
449;00:31:12,364;00:31:14,698;How do you tell yourself
450;00:31:14,796;00:31:17,289;that you're decent
451;00:31:17,387;00:31:19,786;after everything that you've done?
452;00:31:25,356;00:31:27,626;I was your sister's prisoner once.
453;00:31:30,764;00:31:34,090;She hit me on the head with a
453;00:31:30,764;00:31:34,090;rock if I remember correctly.
454;00:31:36,716;00:31:38,474;Yeah.
455;00:31:40,108;00:31:41,354;She should have killed you.
456;00:31:41,451;00:31:43,242;Perhaps, but she didn't.
457;00:31:44,587;00:31:48,169;Catelyn Stark hated me
457;00:31:44,587;00:31:48,169;just like you hate me.
458;00:31:48,267;00:31:50,441;But I didn't hate her.
459;00:31:50,539;00:31:52,041;I admired her.
460;00:31:52,140;00:31:53,929;Far more than her husband or her son.
461;00:31:54,027;00:31:56,201;Do you think I care whom you
461;00:31:54,027;00:31:56,201;admire and whom you don't?
462;00:31:56,299;00:31:58,831;No, I don't, but I'm telling you
462;00:31:56,299;00:31:58,831;anyway because you're my prisoner.
463;00:31:58,860;00:32:01,001;You don't have a choice.
464;00:32:01,099;00:32:03,017;The love she had for her children,
465;00:32:03,115;00:32:05,002;I was a little awed by it.
466;00:32:05,099;00:32:07,369;Reminded me of my sister.
467;00:32:07,467;00:32:10,474;Oh.
467;00:32:07,467;00:32:10,474;Oh, I see.
468;00:32:12,236;00:32:13,962;You're a madman.
469;00:32:14,060;00:32:15,849;I'm not here to trade insults.
470;00:32:15,947;00:32:18,346;Your sister was a strong...
470;00:32:15,947;00:32:18,346;Don't talk about Cat!
471;00:32:18,443;00:32:22,186;I'll talk about whomever I want.
472;00:32:23,179;00:32:25,162;She loved her children.
473;00:32:25,259;00:32:27,721;I suppose all mothers do,
474;00:32:27,819;00:32:30,441;but Catelyn and Cersei,
475;00:32:30,540;00:32:32,521;there's a fierceness
475;00:32:30,540;00:32:32,521;you don't often see.
476;00:32:32,619;00:32:35,305;They'd do anything
476;00:32:32,619;00:32:35,305;to protect their babies.
477;00:32:35,403;00:32:37,129;Start a war.
478;00:32:37,227;00:32:40,842;Burn cities to ash.
478;00:32:37,227;00:32:40,842;Free their worst enemies.
479;00:32:40,940;00:32:43,018;The things we do for love.
480;00:32:47,179;00:32:50,794;You didn't come here
480;00:32:47,179;00:32:50,794;to talk about our sisters.
481;00:32:50,892;00:32:53,674;That's exactly why I came here.
482;00:32:55,211;00:32:57,289;I love Cersei.
483;00:32:57,387;00:32:59,338;You can laugh at that if you want.
484;00:32:59,436;00:33:01,417;You can sneer.
484;00:32:59,436;00:33:01,417;Doesn't matter.
485;00:33:01,516;00:33:03,305;She needs me.
486;00:33:03,403;00:33:07,081;And to get back to her,
486;00:33:03,403;00:33:07,081;I have to take Riverrun.
487;00:33:10,379;00:33:13,386;I'll send for your baby boy.
488;00:33:13,484;00:33:16,618;And I'll launch him into
488;00:33:13,484;00:33:16,618;Riverrun with a catapult.
489;00:33:16,716;00:33:19,882;Because you don't matter
489;00:33:16,716;00:33:19,882;to me, Lord Edmure.
490;00:33:19,979;00:33:22,441;Your son doesn't matter to me.
491;00:33:22,539;00:33:26,058;The people in the castle
491;00:33:22,539;00:33:26,058;don't matter to me.
492;00:33:27,147;00:33:29,161;Only Cersei.
493;00:33:30,635;00:33:33,130;And if I have to
493;00:33:30,635;00:33:33,130;slaughter every Tully
494;00:33:33,228;00:33:36,170;who ever lived to get back to her,
495;00:33:36,268;00:33:38,665;that's what I'll do.
496;00:34:04,523;00:34:06,986;Who goes there?
497;00:34:07,084;00:34:08,746;Edmure Tully,
498;00:34:08,843;00:34:10,249;son of Hoster Tully
499;00:34:10,347;00:34:12,617;and the rightful Lord of Riverrun.
500;00:34:14,924;00:34:16,713;I demand entry.
501;00:34:16,811;00:34:19,497;Don't let him in.
502;00:34:19,595;00:34:21,865;He's the Lord of Riverrun.
503;00:34:21,963;00:34:23,146;I have to obey his commands.
504;00:34:23,243;00:34:24,778;He's been their captive
505;00:34:24,876;00:34:27,561;ever since they murdered
505;00:34:24,876;00:34:27,561;his king at the Red Wedding.
506;00:34:27,660;00:34:30,569;Why do you think the people who
506;00:34:27,660;00:34:30,569;murdered his king at the Red Wedding
507;00:34:30,667;00:34:33,801;would decide to let him come home?
508;00:34:33,899;00:34:36,937;Because it's a trap, you idiot.
509;00:34:37,035;00:34:38,281;Don't let him in.
510;00:34:38,379;00:34:40,009;He's my lord, my lord.
511;00:34:40,107;00:34:42,762;I've sworn to serve the Lord of
511;00:34:40,107;00:34:42,762;Riverrun and obey his commands.
512;00:34:42,860;00:34:45,546;You're not obeying Edmure's commands.
513;00:34:45,644;00:34:49,449;You're obeying the fucking
513;00:34:45,644;00:34:49,449;Kingslayer's commands.
514;00:34:49,547;00:34:52,106;I demand entry.
515;00:34:52,203;00:34:53,514;My lord has given an order.
516;00:34:53,611;00:34:55,529;With a knife to his throat.
517;00:34:55,627;00:34:57,962;That is not a valid order.
518;00:35:02,507;00:35:04,587;Lower the drawbridge and
518;00:35:02,507;00:35:04,587;open the gate for Lord Ed...
519;00:35:04,619;00:35:06,793;Aye, ser.
520;00:35:06,891;00:35:10,281;I'll have your head before
520;00:35:06,891;00:35:10,281;I surrender Riverrun.
521;00:35:10,379;00:35:13,897;You are not lord
521;00:35:10,379;00:35:13,897;of this castle, my lord.
522;00:35:25,131;00:35:27,882;Lower the drawbridge.
522;00:35:25,131;00:35:27,882;- Man?2: Aye, ser!
523;00:36:10,507;00:36:12,105;If you're wrong,
524;00:36:12,203;00:36:15,721;we've just surrendered
524;00:36:12,203;00:36:15,721;our most valuable prisoner.
525;00:36:54,027;00:36:55,785;Welcome home, my lord.
526;00:37:00,331;00:37:03,434;Command all the forces within the
526;00:37:00,331;00:37:03,434;castle to lay down their arms.
527;00:37:05,483;00:37:07,145;Open the gates.
528;00:37:07,243;00:37:09,961;My lord...
528;00:37:07,243;00:37:09,961;Your lord has given a command.
529;00:37:42,571;00:37:45,481;Infantry, advance!
530;00:37:58,091;00:38:00,745;Find the Blackfish.
531;00:38:00,843;00:38:03,945;Put him in irons and hand
531;00:38:00,843;00:38:03,945;him over to the Freys.
532;00:38:07,627;00:38:09,385;Find him.
533;00:38:33,259;00:38:35,273;Go on.
534;00:38:35,371;00:38:36,554;Come with us.
535;00:38:36,651;00:38:38,131;I've run before from the Red Wedding.
536;00:38:38,219;00:38:40,425;I'm not running again.
536;00:38:38,219;00:38:40,425;This is my family home.
537;00:38:40,523;00:38:44,009;Your family is in the North.
537;00:38:40,523;00:38:44,009;Come with us.
538;00:38:44,107;00:38:47,017;Don't die for pride when you
538;00:38:44,107;00:38:47,017;can fight for your blood.
539;00:38:48,587;00:38:52,073;You'll serve Sansa far
539;00:38:48,587;00:38:52,073;better than I ever could.
540;00:38:57,003;00:38:58,473;All the way down!
541;00:38:58,571;00:39:01,258;- Check that out!
541;00:38:58,571;00:39:01,258;Go on, now.
542;00:39:01,355;00:39:04,233;I haven't had a proper
542;00:39:01,355;00:39:04,233;sword fight in years.
543;00:39:04,331;00:39:06,953;I expect I'll make
543;00:39:04,331;00:39:06,953;a damn fool of myself.
544;00:39:39,595;00:39:42,217;We found the Blackfish, my lord.
545;00:39:42,315;00:39:43,817;Good.
546;00:39:43,915;00:39:46,121;Bring him to me.
547;00:39:46,219;00:39:48,521;He died fighting, my lord.
548;00:41:15,051;00:41:17,065;I was wrong. I admit it.
548;00:41:15,051;00:41:17,065;That changes nothing.
549;00:41:17,163;00:41:19,465;The Unsullied could mount
549;00:41:17,163;00:41:19,465;a defense off the beachhead.
550;00:41:19,563;00:41:20,573;If the slavers' forces...
551;00:41:20,689;00:41:22,520;No more talking from you.
551;00:41:20,689;00:41:22,520;Your talking gave us this.
552;00:41:22,635;00:41:24,208;And I have acknowledged that.
552;00:41:22,635;00:41:24,208;I'm trying...
553;00:41:24,235;00:41:26,076;You're trying to tell me
553;00:41:24,235;00:41:26,076;what the army should do.
554;00:41:26,155;00:41:28,489;You do not know
554;00:41:26,155;00:41:28,489;what the army should do.
555;00:41:28,587;00:41:30,665;All right, what should the army do?
556;00:41:30,763;00:41:32,457;We'll not go to the beach.
557;00:41:32,555;00:41:34,796;If we go to the beach, the
557;00:41:32,555;00:41:34,796;Masters will take the pyramid.
558;00:41:34,859;00:41:37,193;The pyramid is the only place
558;00:41:34,859;00:41:37,193;in the city we can defend.
559;00:41:37,290;00:41:38,665;We stay here.
559;00:41:37,290;00:41:38,665;And then?
560;00:41:38,763;00:41:40,489;We wait for them to come to us.
561;00:41:40,587;00:41:42,697;Then we fight them.
562;00:42:49,995;00:42:51,625;Clegane.
563;00:42:51,723;00:42:53,737;What the fuck you doing here?
564;00:42:53,835;00:42:55,849;Chasing them.
564;00:42:53,835;00:42:55,849;You?
565;00:42:55,947;00:42:57,705;Hanging them.
566;00:42:57,803;00:42:59,433;Any particular reason?
567;00:42:59,531;00:43:01,801;They're our men.
567;00:42:59,531;00:43:01,801;Or they were.
568;00:43:01,899;00:43:04,361;They attacked a nearby sept
568;00:43:01,899;00:43:04,361;and murdered the villagers.
569;00:43:04,459;00:43:05,577;Why do you want them?
570;00:43:05,675;00:43:07,113;Same reason.
571;00:43:07,211;00:43:09,161;I was helping build it.
572;00:43:09,259;00:43:11,401;They killed a friend of mine.
573;00:43:11,499;00:43:12,713;You've got friends?
574;00:43:12,811;00:43:15,560;Not anymore.
574;00:43:12,811;00:43:15,560;They're mine.
575;00:43:15,659;00:43:18,153;It's the Brotherhood's good name
575;00:43:15,659;00:43:18,153;they've dragged through the dirt.
576;00:43:18,187;00:43:19,817;Fuck your name.
576;00:43:18,187;00:43:19,817;They're mine.
577;00:43:19,914;00:43:21,394;I killed you once before, Dondarrion.
578;00:43:21,482;00:43:23,369;Happy to do it again.
579;00:43:23,467;00:43:25,641;Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.
580;00:43:26,986;00:43:29,321;Tougher girls than you
580;00:43:26,986;00:43:29,321;have tried to kill me.
581;00:43:31,499;00:43:32,745;You can have one of them.
582;00:43:37,387;00:43:38,697;Two.
583;00:43:49,963;00:43:51,881;No, no, no.
584;00:43:51,979;00:43:54,345;We're not butchers.
584;00:43:51,979;00:43:54,345;We hang them.
585;00:43:54,443;00:43:56,009;Hanging?
586;00:43:56,107;00:43:57,448;All over in an instant.
587;00:43:57,547;00:43:58,921;Where's the punishment in that?
588;00:43:59,018;00:44:01,513;They die.
588;00:43:59,018;00:44:01,513;We all bloody die.
589;00:44:01,611;00:44:03,977;Except this one here.
590;00:44:04,074;00:44:06,057;I'll only gut one of them.
591;00:44:06,155;00:44:08,489;No.
592;00:44:08,587;00:44:10,280;I'll chop off one hand.
593;00:44:10,379;00:44:13,321;We gave you two of the three
593;00:44:10,379;00:44:13,321;out of respect for your loss.
594;00:44:13,418;00:44:14,761;That's generous.
595;00:44:18,379;00:44:21,321;Bunch of nancies.
596;00:44:21,419;00:44:23,817;There was a time I would
596;00:44:21,419;00:44:23,817;have killed all seven of you
597;00:44:23,915;00:44:25,033;just to gut these three.
598;00:44:25,131;00:44:26,377;You're getting old, Clegane.
599;00:44:26,475;00:44:27,881;He's not.
600;00:44:29,898;00:44:32,329;Please don't.
600;00:44:29,898;00:44:32,329;I'll give you anything.
601;00:44:59,754;00:45:01,545;Got anything to eat?
602;00:45:13,323;00:45:15,401;Enjoying yourself?
603;00:45:15,499;00:45:17,480;I prefer chicken.
604;00:45:18,858;00:45:22,057;You ought to join us.
604;00:45:18,858;00:45:22,057;We could use you.
605;00:45:23,306;00:45:25,672;I tried joining.
605;00:45:23,306;00:45:25,672;Didn't work out for me.
606;00:45:25,770;00:45:28,585;Clegane, we're here for a reason.
607;00:45:30,091;00:45:33,321;The Lord of Light is keeping
607;00:45:30,091;00:45:33,321;Beric alive for a reason.
608;00:45:33,419;00:45:35,689;He gave a failed, drunk priest
609;00:45:35,786;00:45:38,408;the power to bring him
609;00:45:35,786;00:45:38,408;back for a reason.
610;00:45:38,506;00:45:40,745;We are part of something
610;00:45:38,506;00:45:40,745;larger than ourselves.
611;00:45:40,843;00:45:43,881;Lots of horrible shit
611;00:45:40,843;00:45:43,881;in this world gets done
612;00:45:43,979;00:45:45,961;for something larger than ourselves.
613;00:45:52,971;00:45:55,849;Cold winds are rising in the North.
614;00:45:55,946;00:45:58,153;And you're going to go stop them?
615;00:45:59,243;00:46:00,713;We need good men to help us.
616;00:46:00,811;00:46:04,424;Last time you saw me,
616;00:46:00,811;00:46:04,424;you wanted to execute me.
617;00:46:05,994;00:46:07,529;True enough.
618;00:46:07,627;00:46:10,569;But the Lord of Light gave
618;00:46:07,627;00:46:10,569;you the power to defeat me.
619;00:46:10,667;00:46:13,064;Why?
620;00:46:13,162;00:46:15,944;I beat you because I'm
620;00:46:13,162;00:46:15,944;better than you, Beric.
621;00:46:16,042;00:46:20,105;I was better than you before you
621;00:46:16,042;00:46:20,105;started yammering on about the Lord
622;00:46:20,202;00:46:23,049;and I'm better than you now.
623;00:46:23,147;00:46:24,873;Aye, you're probably right.
624;00:46:24,971;00:46:27,689;You're a fighter.
625;00:46:27,787;00:46:29,929;You were born a fighter.
626;00:46:30,027;00:46:32,329;You walked away from the fight.
627;00:46:32,426;00:46:34,025;How did that go?
628;00:46:36,714;00:46:39,848;Good and bad, young and old,
629;00:46:39,946;00:46:42,601;the things we're fighting
629;00:46:39,946;00:46:42,601;will destroy them all alike.
630;00:46:44,363;00:46:47,465;You can still help a lot more
630;00:46:44,363;00:46:47,465;than you've harmed, Clegane.
631;00:46:47,563;00:46:49,385;It's not too late for you.
632;00:47:50,571;00:47:52,296;Lady Crane?
633;00:48:00,203;00:48:01,993;Lady Crane?
634;00:48:08,010;00:48:11,625;If you'd have done your job, she
634;00:48:08,010;00:48:11,625;would have died painlessly.
635;00:48:13,770;00:48:15,785;Instead...
636;00:48:17,770;00:48:20,136;The Many-Faced God
636;00:48:17,770;00:48:20,136;was promised a name.
637;00:48:21,483;00:48:23,497;He must always receive what is his.
638;00:48:23,594;00:48:26,185;You can't change that.
639;00:48:26,283;00:48:28,617;I can't change that.
640;00:48:28,715;00:48:30,665;No one can.
641;00:48:33,194;00:48:35,560;And now he's been
641;00:48:33,194;00:48:35,560;promised another name.
642;00:48:50,474;00:48:52,584;Hey!
642;00:48:50,474;00:48:52,584;Get out!
643;00:48:55,339;00:48:57,193;Yah!
644;00:50:13,451;00:50:15,113;Hey!
645;00:50:17,803;00:50:19,561;Yah!
646;00:50:20,587;00:50:22,056;Ah!
647;00:50:33,675;00:50:35,912;My basket!
648;00:52:06,090;00:52:07,593;It will all be over soon.
649;00:52:08,970;00:52:11,656;On your knees or on your feet?
650;00:52:21,962;00:52:24,104;Haven't we been through this already?
651;00:52:26,187;00:52:27,880;That won't help you.
652;00:53:36,650;00:53:38,600;You told her to kill me.
653;00:53:45,034;00:53:46,600;Yes.
654;00:53:46,698;00:53:49,064;But here you are.
655;00:53:49,162;00:53:51,752;And there she is.
656;00:54:01,546;00:54:04,296;Finally a girl is no one.
657;00:54:07,562;00:54:10,920;A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell
658;00:54:11,018;00:54:13,064;and I'm going home.
