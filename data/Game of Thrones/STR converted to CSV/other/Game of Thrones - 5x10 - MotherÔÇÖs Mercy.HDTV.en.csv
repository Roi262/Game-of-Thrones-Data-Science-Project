12;00:02:22,875;00:02:26,293;The Lord has shown me
12;00:02:22,875;00:02:26,293;Bolton banners burning.

17;00:02:58,444;00:02:59,693;Tell me.
18;00:02:59,745;00:03:03,414;The men, many deserted
18;00:02:59,745;00:03:03,414;before dawn.
19;00:03:05,952;00:03:07,618;How many?
20;00:03:07,670;00:03:09,670;Nearly half.
21;00:03:09,705;00:03:12,590;All the sellswords
21;00:03:09,705;00:03:12,590;with all the horses.

23;00:03:27,223;00:03:30,858;Speak up.
23;00:03:27,223;00:03:30,858;Can't be worse than mutiny.
24;00:04:01,340;00:04:03,340;Cut her down.
25;00:04:16,439;00:04:18,322;Your Grace.
26;00:04:18,357;00:04:21,325;The Lady Melisandre
26;00:04:18,357;00:04:21,325;was just seen riding out of camp.
27;00:04:33,539;00:04:35,706;Get the men
27;00:04:33,539;00:04:35,706;into marching formation.
28;00:04:37,627;00:04:39,677;On to Winterfell.
29;00:04:44,183;00:04:47,301;He raised his hands
30;00:04:47,353;00:04:49,637;and they all stood up
30;00:04:47,353;00:04:49,637;at once.
31;00:04:52,358;00:04:56,026;Tens of thousands of them.
31;00:04:52,358;00:04:56,026;The biggest army in the world.
32;00:04:56,062;00:04:57,695;So what are you
32;00:04:56,062;00:04:57,695;gonna do?
33;00:05:00,566;00:05:03,734;I'm gonna hope they don't
33;00:05:00,566;00:05:03,734;learn how to climb the Wall.
34;00:05:03,786;00:05:06,570;But the dragonglass...
35;00:05:07,907;00:05:09,406;No one's ever
35;00:05:07,907;00:05:09,406;getting that back now.
36;00:05:09,408;00:05:12,042;It wouldn't have
36;00:05:09,408;00:05:12,042;mattered anyway.
37;00:05:12,078;00:05:13,494;Not unless we had
37;00:05:12,078;00:05:13,494;a mountain of it.
38;00:05:13,546;00:05:16,163;But you killed
38;00:05:13,546;00:05:16,163;a white walker.
39;00:05:16,215;00:05:17,798;With Longclaw.
40;00:05:19,418;00:05:21,585;I saw them shatter steel axes
40;00:05:19,418;00:05:21,585;like they were glass.
41;00:05:21,587;00:05:24,588;But Longclaw...
41;00:05:21,587;00:05:24,588;-  Is Valyrian steel.
42;00:05:24,590;00:05:27,174;How many Valyrian steel swords
42;00:05:24,590;00:05:27,174;are left in the Seven Kingdoms?
43;00:05:27,226;00:05:29,009;Not enough.
44;00:05:31,681;00:05:33,097;The first Lord Commander
44;00:05:31,681;00:05:33,097;in history
45;00:05:33,099;00:05:35,516;to sacrifice the lives
45;00:05:33,099;00:05:35,516;of sworn brothers
46;00:05:35,568;00:05:37,651;to save the lives
46;00:05:35,568;00:05:37,651;of wildlings.
47;00:05:41,240;00:05:44,274;How's it feel to be friends
47;00:05:41,240;00:05:44,274;with the most hated man in Castle Black?
48;00:05:44,326;00:05:46,360;You were friends with me
48;00:05:44,326;00:05:46,360;when I first came here.
49;00:05:46,412;00:05:48,495;And I wasn't winning
49;00:05:46,412;00:05:48,495;any elections back then.
50;00:05:48,531;00:05:51,582;Here's to us, then.
51;00:05:51,617;00:05:53,283;Long may they sneer.
52;00:06:01,711;00:06:03,510;What?
53;00:06:05,848;00:06:07,681;I wanted to ask
53;00:06:05,848;00:06:07,681;you something.
54;00:06:09,301;00:06:11,268;To ask something of you.
55;00:06:14,223;00:06:17,057;Send me, Gilly,
55;00:06:14,223;00:06:17,057;and the baby to Oldtown
56;00:06:17,109;00:06:19,276;so I can become a maester.
57;00:06:19,311;00:06:22,062;That's what I'm meant to be.
57;00:06:19,311;00:06:22,062;Not this.
58;00:06:22,114;00:06:25,315;I need you here, Sam.
59;00:06:25,367;00:06:27,818;If you leave, who's left
59;00:06:25,367;00:06:27,818;to give me advice I trust?
60;00:06:28,871;00:06:31,238;Well, there's Edd.
61;00:06:34,076;00:06:36,577;I'd be more use
61;00:06:34,076;00:06:36,577;to you as a maester.
62;00:06:36,629;00:06:40,581;More use to everyone
62;00:06:36,629;00:06:40,581;now that Maester Aemon is gone.
63;00:06:40,633;00:06:43,417;The Citadel has the world's
63;00:06:40,633;00:06:43,417;greatest library.
64;00:06:43,469;00:06:46,670;I'll learn about history,
65;00:06:46,672;00:06:49,173;strategy, healing.
66;00:06:49,175;00:06:50,841;And other things,
67;00:06:50,893;00:06:53,844;things that will
67;00:06:50,893;00:06:53,844;help when--
68;00:06:53,896;00:06:55,479;when they come.
69;00:06:58,517;00:07:01,185;If Gilly stays here,
69;00:06:58,517;00:07:01,185;then she'll die.
70;00:07:02,655;00:07:06,023;And the baby that she named
70;00:07:02,655;00:07:06,023;after me will die.
71;00:07:06,025;00:07:09,276;And I'll end up dying, too,
71;00:07:06,025;00:07:09,276;trying to protect them.
72;00:07:11,497;00:07:14,248;Which means that the last thing that
72;00:07:11,497;00:07:14,248;I'll see in this world
73;00:07:14,283;00:07:17,251;will be the look in her eyes
73;00:07:14,283;00:07:17,251;when I fail them.
74;00:07:22,041;00:07:25,175;And I'd rather see
74;00:07:22,041;00:07:25,175;a thousand white walkers than see that.
75;00:07:39,725;00:07:41,725;Thank you.
76;00:07:43,279;00:07:45,395;You know that the Citadel will make you
76;00:07:43,279;00:07:45,395;swear off women, too.
77;00:07:45,447;00:07:47,731;Oh, they'll bloody try.
78;00:07:51,453;00:07:53,787;Sam.
78;00:07:51,453;00:07:53,787;What?
79;00:07:55,407;00:07:57,407;Sam.
80;00:07:58,911;00:08:01,245;You had just been
80;00:07:58,911;00:08:01,245;beaten half to death. How did you--
81;00:08:01,247;00:08:03,881;Oh, very carefully.
82;00:08:05,751;00:08:07,000;I'm glad
82;00:08:05,751;00:08:07,000;the end of the world's
83;00:08:07,086;00:08:08,752;working out well
83;00:08:07,086;00:08:08,752;for someone.
84;00:08:13,592;00:08:15,642;I'll come back.
85;00:08:17,263;00:08:19,096;To your return.
86;00:08:19,148;00:08:21,765;To my return.
87;00:10:00,366;00:10:03,700;Aye, this way.
88;00:10:38,070;00:10:39,736;My lady!
89;00:10:41,991;00:10:43,457;Stannis.
90;00:10:43,492;00:10:45,625;Stannis Baratheon is coming.
90;00:10:43,492;00:10:45,625;His whole army.
91;00:10:45,661;00:10:47,077;How do you know
91;00:10:45,661;00:10:47,077;it's Stannis?
92;00:10:47,162;00:10:49,046;They're carrying his
92;00:10:47,162;00:10:49,046;flaming heart banners.
93;00:10:49,081;00:10:52,632;From the Blackwater.
93;00:10:49,081;00:10:52,632;I'll never forget it.
94;00:11:29,872;00:11:31,505;Trench here.
95;00:11:31,540;00:11:33,757;Another one 300 yards
95;00:11:31,540;00:11:33,757;from the castle wall.
96;00:11:33,792;00:11:35,959;Hurry them along.
97;00:11:36,011;00:11:37,511;Right, Curlew.
97;00:11:36,011;00:11:37,511;Yes, sir.
98;00:11:37,546;00:11:38,762;Dig between those two rises.
99;00:11:38,797;00:11:40,680;Spread out.

100;00:11:40,716;00:11:42,966;- Spread out!
101;00:11:42,968;00:11:45,552;And send out
101;00:11:42,968;00:11:45,552;a foraging party immediately.
102;00:11:45,604;00:11:47,888;Siege begins
102;00:11:45,604;00:11:47,888;at sunrise.
103;00:11:47,940;00:11:50,357;There's not going
103;00:11:47,940;00:11:50,357;to be a siege, Your Grace.
104;00:12:31,850;00:12:34,518;We've got no chance!
105;00:13:43,922;00:13:46,473;No, please, please.
106;00:14:39,645;00:14:42,028;Bolton has women
106;00:14:39,645;00:14:42,028;fighting for him?
107;00:14:43,198;00:14:45,315;I don't fight

108;00:14:46,652;00:14:48,702;I'm Brienne of Tarth.
109;00:14:50,822;00:14:53,657;I was Kingsguard

110;00:14:59,798;00:15:03,500;I was there when he was
110;00:14:59,798;00:15:03,500;murdered by a shadow with your face.
111;00:15:06,338;00:15:09,673;You murdered him
111;00:15:06,338;00:15:09,673;with blood magic?
112;00:15:15,180;00:15:17,013;I did.

120;00:16:18,293;00:16:20,493;Looks like we're done here.

135;00:18:02,764;00:18:04,514;Warden of the North.
136;00:18:04,516;00:18:06,516;Ramsay needs you.
137;00:18:08,820;00:18:11,938;Though I suppose
137;00:18:08,820;00:18:11,938;he doesn't need all of you.
138;00:18:11,990;00:18:14,657;Just the parts he'll use
138;00:18:11,990;00:18:14,657;to make his heir,
139;00:18:14,693;00:18:17,827;until you've given him a boy or two
139;00:18:14,693;00:18:17,827;and he's finished using them.
140;00:18:19,414;00:18:24,451;Then he's got incredible
140;00:18:19,414;00:18:24,451;plans for those parts.
141;00:18:25,787;00:18:27,704;So, shall we wait
141;00:18:25,787;00:18:27,704;for him to come back
142;00:18:27,706;00:18:29,706;or should we begin now?
143;00:18:31,710;00:18:33,877;You're leaving it to me?
144;00:18:33,962;00:18:35,545;Good.
145;00:18:35,597;00:18:37,347;Let's begin.
146;00:18:39,684;00:18:41,885;Reek-- stop!
147;00:18:41,887;00:18:43,770;Stop!
148;00:18:50,395;00:18:53,563;-  Open the gate!
149;00:19:00,572;00:19:02,572;He's coming back.
150;00:20:37,669;00:20:41,254;I can see I have
150;00:20:37,669;00:20:41,254;my work cut out for me.
151;00:20:41,339;00:20:43,506;You two, out.
152;00:21:37,896;00:21:41,648;You were the first person
152;00:21:37,896;00:21:41,648;on my list, you know.
153;00:21:41,700;00:21:44,734;For killing Syrio Forel.
153;00:21:41,700;00:21:44,734;Remember him?
154;00:21:44,736;00:21:47,070;Probably not.
155;00:21:49,074;00:21:52,208;I've gotten a few
155;00:21:49,074;00:21:52,208;of the others.
156;00:21:52,243;00:21:55,411;The Many-Faced God stole
156;00:21:52,243;00:21:55,411;a few more from me.
157;00:21:55,413;00:21:57,964;But I'm glad
157;00:21:55,413;00:21:57,964;he left me you.
158;00:22:01,720;00:22:03,636;Do you know who I am?
159;00:22:07,809;00:22:10,093;I can't hear you.
160;00:22:18,486;00:22:20,820;You know who I am.
161;00:22:20,855;00:22:22,939;I'm Arya Stark.
162;00:22:32,000;00:22:34,500;Do you know
162;00:22:32,000;00:22:34,500;who you are?
163;00:22:36,921;00:22:38,671;You're no one.
164;00:22:39,708;00:22:41,791;You're nothing.
165;00:23:25,420;00:23:27,670;A girl has taken a life.
166;00:23:27,722;00:23:30,173;The wrong life.
167;00:23:32,177;00:23:34,010;I was right about her.
168;00:23:34,095;00:23:35,511;You were.
169;00:23:37,182;00:23:39,348;You're not ready.
170;00:23:40,935;00:23:42,685;Not at all.
171;00:23:46,107;00:23:48,908;That man's life
171;00:23:46,107;00:23:48,908;was not yours to take.
172;00:23:50,411;00:23:52,528;A girl stole from
172;00:23:50,411;00:23:52,528;the Many-Faced God.
173;00:23:54,199;00:23:56,415;Now a debt is owed.
174;00:24:02,540;00:24:04,373;Only death
174;00:24:02,540;00:24:04,373;can pay for life.
175;00:24:17,522;00:24:19,806;No! No!
176;00:24:19,891;00:24:23,276;No, you-- don't die!
176;00:24:19,891;00:24:23,276;Don't die!
177;00:24:28,900;00:24:30,616;Why are you crying?
178;00:24:32,120;00:24:33,820;He was my friend.
179;00:24:33,872;00:24:36,572;No, he wasn't.
179;00:24:33,872;00:24:36,572;Didn't you listen to him?
180;00:24:37,909;00:24:39,909;He was no one.
181;00:24:41,913;00:24:45,164;But if you're--
182;00:24:47,752;00:24:49,135;who's this?
183;00:24:49,220;00:24:51,087;No one at all.
184;00:24:51,139;00:24:54,841;Just as a girl should have been
184;00:24:51,139;00:24:54,841;before she took a face from the hall.
185;00:25:00,982;00:25:03,649;The faces are for no one.
186;00:25:03,685;00:25:05,268;You are still someone.
187;00:25:08,273;00:25:10,690;And to someone,
188;00:25:10,742;00:25:12,275;the faces are as good
188;00:25:10,742;00:25:12,275;as poison.
189;00:25:25,590;00:25:27,123;I can't see.
190;00:25:33,131;00:25:35,882;What's happening?
191;00:25:35,934;00:25:38,017;What's happening?!
192;00:25:47,812;00:25:50,980;- I wish you a safe journey home.
192;00:25:47,812;00:25:50,980;Thank you.
193;00:25:56,037;00:25:58,487;Forgive me, child.
194;00:25:58,539;00:26:02,375;I wish you all the happiness
194;00:25:58,539;00:26:02,375;in the world.
195;00:26:19,677;00:26:21,894;Maybe I'll come
195;00:26:19,677;00:26:21,894;visit you sometime.
196;00:26:21,930;00:26:23,846;Maybe I'll come
196;00:26:21,930;00:26:23,846;visit you.
197;00:26:23,898;00:26:25,514;Don't wait too long.
198;00:26:25,566;00:26:27,266;Got a noblewoman
198;00:26:25,566;00:26:27,266;to marry back home.
199;00:26:28,353;00:26:30,019;You want a good girl,
200;00:26:30,021;00:26:32,321;but you need
200;00:26:30,021;00:26:32,321;the bad pussy.
201;00:26:35,410;00:26:37,660;Whenever you're
201;00:26:35,410;00:26:37,660;ready, my lord.
202;00:26:53,344;00:26:55,711;Try not to lose it
202;00:26:53,344;00:26:55,711;this time.
203;00:26:57,715;00:27:00,599;I'll never
203;00:26:57,715;00:27:00,599;take it off again.
204;00:27:00,635;00:27:03,636;I know you didn't
204;00:27:00,635;00:27:03,636;want to leave Dorne,
205;00:27:03,721;00:27:05,855;but I'm glad
205;00:27:03,721;00:27:05,855;you're coming home.
206;00:27:05,890;00:27:07,606;Your mother's desperate
206;00:27:05,890;00:27:07,606;to see you.
207;00:27:07,642;00:27:10,026;I'm glad Trystane
207;00:27:07,642;00:27:10,026;is coming with us.
208;00:27:10,061;00:27:11,861;He seems like a nice boy.
209;00:27:11,896;00:27:13,646;You're lucky.
210;00:27:13,698;00:27:17,033;Arranged marriages
210;00:27:13,698;00:27:17,033;are rarely so--
211;00:27:17,068;00:27:19,235;so well arranged.
212;00:27:19,287;00:27:20,987;Do you think Mother
212;00:27:19,287;00:27:20,987;will like him?
213;00:27:22,457;00:27:25,875;If she sees you're happy,
213;00:27:22,457;00:27:25,875;I'm sure she will.
214;00:27:25,910;00:27:27,243;You really believe that?
215;00:27:27,245;00:27:30,046;Have you ever known
215;00:27:27,245;00:27:30,046;your mother to like anyone
216;00:27:30,081;00:27:32,415;aside from her children?
217;00:27:32,417;00:27:34,250;She likes you.
218;00:27:34,252;00:27:37,136;I'm not so sure
218;00:27:34,252;00:27:37,136;about that.
219;00:27:37,221;00:27:38,754;Listen...
220;00:27:40,725;00:27:43,009;there's something
220;00:27:40,725;00:27:43,009;I wanted to tell you.
221;00:27:44,345;00:27:47,513;Something I should
221;00:27:44,345;00:27:47,513;have told you long ago.
222;00:27:47,565;00:27:49,398;So...
223;00:27:51,652;00:27:54,270;now that you've seen
223;00:27:51,652;00:27:54,270;more of the world,
224;00:27:54,322;00:27:57,990;you've learned how complicated
224;00:27:54,322;00:27:57,990;things can be,
225;00:27:58,026;00:28:00,109;people can be.
226;00:28:00,161;00:28:03,446;The Lannisters and the Martells have
226;00:28:00,161;00:28:03,446;hated each other for years,
227;00:28:03,448;00:28:05,698;but you've fallen
227;00:28:03,448;00:28:05,698;in love with Trystane.
228;00:28:05,750;00:28:08,451;It was an accident, really.
228;00:28:05,750;00:28:08,451;I mean, what were the chances?
229;00:28:08,503;00:28:10,286;You happen to fall
229;00:28:08,503;00:28:10,286;in love with the man
230;00:28:10,338;00:28:12,455;you were assigned
230;00:28:10,338;00:28:12,455;to marry?
231;00:28:12,457;00:28:14,206;My point is...
232;00:28:16,427;00:28:19,462;we don't choose
232;00:28:16,427;00:28:19,462;whom we love.
233;00:28:19,464;00:28:21,764;It just, well--
234;00:28:23,885;00:28:26,385;it's beyond our control.
235;00:28:26,437;00:28:28,304;I sound like an idiot.
235;00:28:26,437;00:28:28,304;No, you don't.
236;00:28:28,356;00:28:30,890;What I'm trying to say--
236;00:28:28,356;00:28:30,890;what I'm trying
237;00:28:30,942;00:28:32,224;and failing to say--
238;00:28:32,276;00:28:33,642;I know what
238;00:28:32,276;00:28:33,642;you're trying to say.
239;00:28:33,694;00:28:36,062;No, I'm afraid you don't.
240;00:28:36,147;00:28:37,780;I do.
241;00:28:40,985;00:28:43,652;I know.
242;00:28:43,654;00:28:45,237;About you and Mother.
243;00:28:47,658;00:28:50,042;I think a part of me
243;00:28:47,658;00:28:50,042;always knew.
244;00:28:51,829;00:28:54,797;And I'm glad.
245;00:28:57,835;00:29:00,419;I'm glad
245;00:28:57,835;00:29:00,419;that you're my father.
246;00:29:35,289;00:29:37,206;Myrcella?
247;00:29:39,544;00:29:41,844;Myrcella?
248;00:29:48,186;00:29:51,103;Myrcella?
248;00:29:48,186;00:29:51,103;Myrcella?
249;00:31:09,300;00:31:11,467;You love her,
249;00:31:09,300;00:31:11,467;don't you?
250;00:31:15,473;00:31:17,606;How could you not?
251;00:31:17,642;00:31:21,060;Of course it's hopeless
251;00:31:17,642;00:31:21,060;for the both of you.
252;00:31:21,112;00:31:24,647;A sellsword from the fighting pits,
252;00:31:21,112;00:31:24,647;a disgraced knight.
253;00:31:24,649;00:31:26,782;Neither one of you
253;00:31:24,649;00:31:26,782;is fit consort for a queen.
254;00:31:28,986;00:31:33,072;But we always want
254;00:31:28,986;00:31:33,072;the wrong woman.
255;00:31:33,124;00:31:35,207;Does he always
255;00:31:33,124;00:31:35,207;talk so much?
256;00:31:38,045;00:31:40,296;Jorah the Andal.
257;00:31:40,331;00:31:42,498;Torgo Nudho.
258;00:31:42,583;00:31:44,049;He should not be here.
259;00:31:44,085;00:31:45,417;No, but he is.
260;00:31:45,469;00:31:48,137;Our queen ordered him
260;00:31:45,469;00:31:48,137;exiled from city.
261;00:31:48,172;00:31:50,422;Our queen would be dead
261;00:31:48,172;00:31:50,422;if not for him.
262;00:32:12,947;00:32:15,698;Puñila.
262;00:32:12,947;00:32:15,698;Thank you.
263;00:32:15,750;00:32:18,500;I am sorry.
264;00:32:18,536;00:32:21,036;Sorry I not there
264;00:32:18,536;00:32:21,036;to fight for our queen.
265;00:32:21,038;00:32:23,038;You missed a good scrap.
266;00:32:23,040;00:32:24,040;None of that matters now.
267;00:32:24,125;00:32:25,507;The longer we sit
267;00:32:24,125;00:32:25,507;here bantering,
268;00:32:25,543;00:32:28,093;the longer Daenerys is out there
268;00:32:25,543;00:32:28,093;in the wilderness.
269;00:32:28,129;00:32:30,512;He's right.
269;00:32:28,129;00:32:30,512;The dragon headed north.
270;00:32:30,548;00:32:32,548;If we're going to find her,
270;00:32:30,548;00:32:32,548;that's where we'll have to go.
271;00:32:32,600;00:32:33,682;We?
272;00:32:33,718;00:32:35,601;You're a Lannister.
273;00:32:35,636;00:32:38,554;The queen intends to remove
273;00:32:35,636;00:32:38,554;your family from power.
274;00:32:38,606;00:32:40,306;And I intend
274;00:32:38,606;00:32:40,306;to help her do it.
275;00:32:40,358;00:32:42,975;You've been here
275;00:32:40,358;00:32:42,975;for how many days now?
276;00:32:43,027;00:32:44,560;I've fought
276;00:32:43,027;00:32:44,560;for her for years.
277;00:32:44,562;00:32:46,145;Since she was little
277;00:32:44,562;00:32:46,145;more than a child.
278;00:32:46,230;00:32:48,447;You betrayed her.
278;00:32:46,230;00:32:48,447;Careful now.
279;00:32:48,482;00:32:50,899;And she exiled you.
279;00:32:48,482;00:32:50,899;Twice, I believe.
280;00:32:50,951;00:32:52,534;The second time
280;00:32:50,951;00:32:52,534;thanks to you.
281;00:32:52,570;00:32:54,903;Don't blame me
281;00:32:52,570;00:32:54,903;for your crimes, Mormont.
282;00:32:54,905;00:32:57,623;He's right.
282;00:32:54,905;00:32:57,623;Our queen exiled Jorah.
283;00:32:57,658;00:33:00,659;And he's right.
283;00:32:57,658;00:33:00,659;Jorah saved her life.
284;00:33:00,711;00:33:02,711;Perhaps she feels
284;00:33:00,711;00:33:02,711;differently about him now.
285;00:33:02,747;00:33:05,247;Perhaps not. The only way
285;00:33:02,747;00:33:05,247;we'll know is if we ask her.
286;00:33:05,299;00:33:08,967;Fine, fine.
286;00:33:05,299;00:33:08,967;I suppose he can join us.
287;00:33:09,003;00:33:11,553;Just as long as he promises
287;00:33:09,003;00:33:11,553;not to kill me in my sleep.
288;00:33:11,589;00:33:14,807;If I ever kill you,
288;00:33:11,589;00:33:14,807;your eyes will be wide open.
289;00:33:14,842;00:33:17,593;Forgive me, but why would
289;00:33:14,842;00:33:17,593;we bring you?
290;00:33:19,096;00:33:20,429;Pardon me?
291;00:33:20,431;00:33:22,564;Have you ever tracked
291;00:33:20,431;00:33:22,564;animals in the wilderness?
292;00:33:22,600;00:33:25,434;Not precisely, but I have other skills
292;00:33:22,600;00:33:25,434;that would be useful.
293;00:33:25,486;00:33:27,486;Can you fight?
294;00:33:27,571;00:33:28,937;I have fought.
295;00:33:28,939;00:33:30,773;I don't claim to be
295;00:33:28,939;00:33:30,773;a great warrior.
296;00:33:30,775;00:33:32,858;Are you good
296;00:33:30,775;00:33:32,858;on a horse?
297;00:33:32,910;00:33:34,276;Middling.
298;00:33:34,278;00:33:36,412;So mainly you talk.
299;00:33:36,447;00:33:38,614;And drink.
299;00:33:36,447;00:33:38,614;I've survived so far.
300;00:33:38,666;00:33:42,034;Which I respect, but you would
300;00:33:38,666;00:33:42,034;not help us on this expedition.
301;00:33:43,954;00:33:46,004;You would help us
301;00:33:43,954;00:33:46,004;here in Meereen, though.
302;00:33:47,124;00:33:48,874;None of us have experience
302;00:33:47,124;00:33:48,874;governing a city
303;00:33:48,926;00:33:50,125;except for him.
304;00:33:50,177;00:33:52,177;You want to prove
304;00:33:50,177;00:33:52,177;your value to the queen?
305;00:33:52,213;00:33:53,545;Prove it right here
305;00:33:52,213;00:33:53,545;in Meereen.
306;00:33:53,597;00:33:56,348;He's a foreign dwarf
306;00:33:53,597;00:33:56,348;that barely speaks the language.
307;00:33:56,384;00:33:57,850;Why would the Meereenese
307;00:33:56,384;00:33:57,850;listen to him?
308;00:33:57,885;00:33:59,768;They wouldn't.
309;00:33:59,804;00:34:01,687;They will listen
309;00:33:59,804;00:34:01,687;to Grey Worm.
310;00:34:01,722;00:34:03,355;I'll come with you.
311;00:34:03,391;00:34:05,441;I'll find our queen.
312;00:34:05,476;00:34:07,893;You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
312;00:34:05,476;00:34:07,893;I am.
313;00:34:07,945;00:34:10,195;He is. He's the toughest man
313;00:34:07,945;00:34:10,195;with no balls I ever met.
314;00:34:10,231;00:34:13,365;But you still can't go.
315;00:34:13,451;00:34:15,117;The people believe in you.
316;00:34:15,152;00:34:16,952;They know you speak
316;00:34:15,152;00:34:16,952;for the queen.
317;00:34:16,987;00:34:18,904;It's true.
318;00:34:18,956;00:34:20,989;Only the Unsullied can keep
318;00:34:18,956;00:34:20,989;the peace in Meereen.
319;00:34:21,041;00:34:24,326;If you leave, half this city will
319;00:34:21,041;00:34:24,326;consume the other half.
320;00:34:24,328;00:34:26,578;And Missandei.
321;00:34:26,630;00:34:29,548;Our queen trusts no one
321;00:34:26,630;00:34:29,548;more than Missandei.
322;00:34:29,583;00:34:32,334;Certainly not me.
323;00:34:32,386;00:34:34,503;The queen's
323;00:34:32,386;00:34:34,503;closest confidante,
324;00:34:34,505;00:34:37,172;the commander
324;00:34:34,505;00:34:37,172;of the Unsullied,
325;00:34:37,224;00:34:39,975;and a foreign dwarf
325;00:34:37,224;00:34:39,975;with a scarred face.
326;00:34:41,178;00:34:42,644;Good fortune,
326;00:34:41,178;00:34:42,644;my friends.
327;00:34:42,680;00:34:44,563;Meereen is ancient
327;00:34:42,680;00:34:44,563;and glorious.
328;00:34:44,598;00:34:46,648;Try not to ruin her.
329;00:34:48,352;00:34:50,185;Looks like it's you and me,
329;00:34:48,352;00:34:50,185;Jorah the Andal.
330;00:34:50,187;00:34:52,271;Let's find
330;00:34:50,187;00:34:52,271;some good horses.
331;00:34:52,323;00:34:54,690;We have so much
331;00:34:52,323;00:34:54,690;to talk about.
332;00:35:27,641;00:35:29,641;Hello, old friend.
333;00:35:31,395;00:35:35,197;I thought we were so happy together
333;00:35:31,395;00:35:35,197;until you abandoned me.
334;00:35:37,067;00:35:39,868;I suppose there's no point
334;00:35:37,067;00:35:39,868;asking how you found me.
335;00:35:39,904;00:35:42,237;The birds sing in the west,
335;00:35:39,904;00:35:42,237;the birds sing in the east,
336;00:35:42,289;00:35:44,540;if one knows
336;00:35:42,289;00:35:44,540;how to listen.
337;00:35:45,743;00:35:47,409;They tell me you've
337;00:35:45,743;00:35:47,409;already found favor
338;00:35:47,461;00:35:49,578;with the Mother
338;00:35:47,461;00:35:49,578;of Dragons.
339;00:35:49,580;00:35:52,331;Well, she didn't
339;00:35:49,580;00:35:52,331;execute me,
340;00:35:52,383;00:35:55,717;so that's
340;00:35:52,383;00:35:55,717;a promising start.
341;00:35:55,753;00:35:57,836;Now the heroes
341;00:35:55,753;00:35:57,836;are off to find her
342;00:35:57,888;00:36:00,055;and I'm stuck here
343;00:36:00,090;00:36:03,675;trying to placate a city
343;00:36:00,090;00:36:03,675;on the brink of civil war.
344;00:36:03,727;00:36:05,477;Any advice
344;00:36:03,727;00:36:05,477;for an old comrade?
345;00:36:05,513;00:36:07,012;Information is the key.
346;00:36:07,064;00:36:09,598;You need to learn
346;00:36:07,064;00:36:09,598;your enemy's strengths and strategies.
347;00:36:09,650;00:36:14,152;You need to learn which of your friends
347;00:36:09,650;00:36:14,152;are not your friends.
348;00:36:14,188;00:36:17,489;If only I knew someone
348;00:36:14,188;00:36:17,489;with a vast network of spies.
349;00:36:17,525;00:36:19,575;If only.
350;00:36:21,278;00:36:24,363;A grand old city
351;00:36:24,415;00:36:27,115;choking on violence,
351;00:36:24,415;00:36:27,115;corruption, and deceit.
352;00:36:27,167;00:36:30,118;Who could possibly
352;00:36:27,167;00:36:30,118;have any experience
353;00:36:30,204;00:36:33,005;managing such a massive,
353;00:36:30,204;00:36:33,005;ungainly beast?
354;00:36:38,679;00:36:40,963;I did miss you.
355;00:36:42,132;00:36:43,849;Oh, I know.
356;00:37:05,489;00:37:07,322;We have to go home.
357;00:37:13,664;00:37:16,832;Oh, my poor,
357;00:37:13,664;00:37:16,832;sweet thing.
358;00:37:16,884;00:37:19,001;Does it hurt?
359;00:37:21,672;00:37:23,672;We have to go home.
360;00:37:26,844;00:37:28,260;Drogon.
361;00:37:28,312;00:37:30,512;Can you take me
361;00:37:28,312;00:37:30,512;back to Meereen?
362;00:37:34,685;00:37:37,185;How far
362;00:37:34,685;00:37:37,185;did you carry me?
363;00:37:45,245;00:37:47,696;Drogon, we need
363;00:37:45,245;00:37:47,696;to return.
364;00:37:47,748;00:37:49,498;My people need me.
365;00:38:21,732;00:38:23,782;Well, there's no food.
366;00:38:23,817;00:38:26,902;At the very least,
366;00:38:23,817;00:38:26,902;you could hunt us some supper.
367;00:41:04,394;00:41:05,861;Confess.
368;00:41:09,650;00:41:11,867;Confess.
369;00:41:23,247;00:41:25,247;I have sinned.
370;00:41:25,249;00:41:28,083;I see that now.
371;00:41:28,085;00:41:30,802;How can I have been
371;00:41:28,085;00:41:30,802;so blind for so long?
372;00:41:32,723;00:41:35,006;I want to be clean again.
373;00:41:36,226;00:41:38,426;I want absolution.
374;00:41:40,430;00:41:44,232;The Crone came to me
374;00:41:40,430;00:41:44,232;with her lamp raised high.
375;00:41:44,268;00:41:45,934;And by its holy light--
376;00:41:45,986;00:41:48,520;You wish to make
376;00:41:45,986;00:41:48,520;a confession?
377;00:41:51,775;00:41:54,192;Once I've confessed,
377;00:41:51,775;00:41:54,192;will I be free?
378;00:41:54,278;00:41:57,279;Your Grace will be
378;00:41:54,278;00:41:57,279;dealt with according to her sins.
379;00:41:59,616;00:42:01,833;The Mother have
379;00:41:59,616;00:42:01,833;mercy, then.
380;00:42:04,288;00:42:06,955;I lay with a man outside
380;00:42:04,288;00:42:06,955;the bonds of marriage. I confess.
381;00:42:06,957;00:42:08,707;Name him.
382;00:42:12,880;00:42:14,296;Lancel Lannister.
383;00:42:14,298;00:42:17,549;Your cousin
383;00:42:14,298;00:42:17,549;and the king's squire.
384;00:42:17,601;00:42:20,468;I was lonely and afraid.
384;00:42:17,601;00:42:20,468;You had a husband.
385;00:42:20,520;00:42:22,470;A husband off whoring
385;00:42:20,520;00:42:22,470;every chance he--
386;00:42:22,522;00:42:25,440;His sins do not
386;00:42:22,522;00:42:25,440;pardon your own.
387;00:42:27,477;00:42:29,527;May the gods forgive me.
388;00:42:31,698;00:42:33,398;Other men?
389;00:42:34,484;00:42:35,784;No.
390;00:42:35,819;00:42:37,986;No others?
391;00:42:39,406;00:42:41,239;No.
392;00:42:41,291;00:42:44,826;Speaking falsehoods
392;00:42:41,291;00:42:44,826;before the gods is a great crime.
393;00:42:44,828;00:42:46,378;You understand this?
394;00:42:46,413;00:42:48,079;I do.
395;00:42:50,334;00:42:52,217;There are those
395;00:42:50,334;00:42:52,217;that say your children
396;00:42:52,252;00:42:55,086;were not fathered
396;00:42:52,252;00:42:55,086;by King Robert,
397;00:42:55,138;00:42:58,723;that they are bastards
397;00:42:55,138;00:42:58,723;born of incest and adultery.
398;00:42:58,759;00:43:00,675;A lie.
399;00:43:00,677;00:43:02,978;A lie from the lips
399;00:43:00,677;00:43:02,978;of Stannis Baratheon.
400;00:43:03,013;00:43:05,680;He wants the throne, but his brother's
400;00:43:03,013;00:43:05,680;4 children stand in his way.
401;00:43:05,732;00:43:09,017;So he claims they are
401;00:43:05,732;00:43:09,017;not his brother's.
402;00:43:09,019;00:43:11,019;That filth.
403;00:43:12,356;00:43:14,606;There is not one shred
403;00:43:12,356;00:43:14,606;of truth to it.
404;00:43:14,691;00:43:16,775;I deny it.
405;00:43:18,362;00:43:20,278;Good.
406;00:43:21,415;00:43:24,866;But these
406;00:43:21,415;00:43:24,866;are terrible charges.
407;00:43:24,868;00:43:27,535;And the realm must know
407;00:43:24,868;00:43:27,535;the truth of them.
408;00:43:27,537;00:43:30,005;If Your Grace has given

409;00:43:30,040;00:43:32,207;your innocence.
410;00:43:32,259;00:43:34,709;Trial?

412;00:43:36,430;00:43:38,380;Others you have denied.
413;00:43:38,382;00:43:42,183;Your trial will separate the truths
413;00:43:38,382;00:43:42,183;from the falsehoods.
414;00:43:44,388;00:43:47,722;I bow to the wisdom
414;00:43:44,388;00:43:47,722;of Your High Holiness.
415;00:43:49,726;00:43:52,027;But if I might beg
416;00:43:52,062;00:43:54,646;for just one drop
416;00:43:52,062;00:43:54,646;of the Mother's mercy.
417;00:43:56,733;00:43:59,701;I haven't seen my son--
