1;00:00:06,075;00:00:08,034;Clegane, look into the flames.
2;00:00:08,284;00:00:09,575;What do you see?
3;00:00:09,576;00:00:11,367;A wall of ice.
4;00:00:12,451;00:00:13,783;The Wall.
5;00:00:15,409;00:00:17,074;The only thing standing
5;00:00:15,409;00:00:17,074;between us
6;00:00:17,075;00:00:18,741;and the army of the dead
6;00:00:17,075;00:00:18,741;is the Wall,
7;00:00:18,742;00:00:21,534;and the Wall hasn't been
7;00:00:18,742;00:00:21,534;properly manned in centuries.
8;00:00:21,867;00:00:23,325;Last time we saw The Night King,
9;00:00:23,326;00:00:24,367;it was at Hardhome.
10;00:00:24,783;00:00:27,616;Closest castle to Hardhome
10;00:00:24,783;00:00:27,616;is Eastwatch by the sea.
11;00:00:27,617;00:00:29,377;And that's where I'll go.
12;00:00:29,658;00:00:32,200;Looks like we're
12;00:00:29,658;00:00:32,200;the Nightswatch now.
13;00:00:35,742;00:00:38,576;This suits you, Lady Stark.
14;00:00:39,534;00:00:41,992;Jon left you in charge?
14;00:00:39,534;00:00:41,992;He did.
15;00:00:52,159;00:00:55,034;Lord Tarly.
15;00:00:52,159;00:00:55,034;I believe you know my son.
16;00:00:55,242;00:00:56,700;Do you fight with us...
17;00:00:57,492;00:00:59,658;or with the fallen savages
17;00:00:57,492;00:00:59,658;and eunuchs?
18;00:01:01,284;00:01:03,033;What do you think I should do?
19;00:01:03,034;00:01:05,783;If you use them to melt castles
19;00:01:03,034;00:01:05,783;and burn cities,
20;00:01:06,117;00:01:07,200;you're not different.
21;00:01:07,617;00:01:09,284;You're just more of the same.
22;00:01:11,117;00:01:12,451;Listen.

39;00:04:44,034;00:04:46,033;No, I do not.

42;00:04:50,825;00:04:52,576;on King's Landing.
43;00:04:54,617;00:04:56,075;I have to tell Cersei.
44;00:04:58,908;00:05:00,867;May as well jump
44;00:04:58,908;00:05:00,867;back in that river.
45;00:06:15,242;00:06:18,199;I know what Cersei has told you.
46;00:06:18,200;00:06:22,949;That I've come
46;00:06:18,200;00:06:22,949;to destroy your cities,
47;00:06:22,950;00:06:24,199;burn down your homes,
48;00:06:24,200;00:06:25,950;murder you,
48;00:06:24,200;00:06:25,950;and orphan your children.
49;00:06:28,783;00:06:32,575;That's Cersei Lannister, not me.
50;00:06:32,576;00:06:34,782;I'm not here to murder,
51;00:06:34,783;00:06:36,533;and all I want to destroy
52;00:06:36,534;00:06:39,616;is the wheel that has
52;00:06:36,534;00:06:39,616;rolled over rich and poor
53;00:06:39,617;00:06:43,825;to the benefit of no one but the
53;00:06:39,617;00:06:43,825;Cersei Lannisters of the world.
54;00:06:45,034;00:06:47,283;I offer you a choice--
55;00:06:47,284;00:06:49,616;bend the knee and join me.
56;00:06:49,617;00:06:53,782;Together, we will leave the world
56;00:06:49,617;00:06:53,782;a better place than we found it.
57;00:06:53,783;00:06:56,782;Or refuse...
58;00:06:56,783;00:06:58,284;and die.
59;00:07:27,284;00:07:28,825;Step forward, my lord.
60;00:07:37,992;00:07:39,949;You will not kneel?
61;00:07:39,950;00:07:41,326;I already have a queen.
62;00:07:42,534;00:07:44,033;My sister.
63;00:07:44,034;00:07:45,241;She wasn't your queen
64;00:07:45,242;00:07:47,283;until recently, though, was she?
65;00:07:47,284;00:07:49,616;When she murdered
65;00:07:47,284;00:07:49,616;your rightful queen
66;00:07:49,617;00:07:52,241;and destroyed House Tyrell
66;00:07:49,617;00:07:52,241;for all time.
67;00:07:52,242;00:07:55,534;So it appears your allegiances
67;00:07:52,242;00:07:55,534;are somewhat flexible.
68;00:07:56,658;00:07:59,575;There are
68;00:07:56,658;00:07:59,575;no easy choices in war.
69;00:07:59,576;00:08:01,949;Say what you will
69;00:07:59,576;00:08:01,949;about your sister,
70;00:08:01,950;00:08:04,450;she was born in Westeros.
71;00:08:04,451;00:08:06,700;She's lived here all her life.
72;00:08:08,700;00:08:11,533;You, on the other hand,
73;00:08:11,534;00:08:14,283;murdered your own father
74;00:08:14,284;00:08:17,408;and chose to support
74;00:08:14,284;00:08:17,408;a foreign invader.
75;00:08:17,409;00:08:20,242;One with no ties to this land...
76;00:08:21,867;00:08:24,242;with an army of savages
76;00:08:21,867;00:08:24,242;at her back.
77;00:08:26,075;00:08:27,908;You will not trade
77;00:08:26,075;00:08:27,908;your honor for your life.
78;00:08:29,908;00:08:31,366;I respect that.
79;00:08:31,367;00:08:34,408;Perhaps he could take
79;00:08:31,367;00:08:34,408;the Black, Your Grace.
80;00:08:34,409;00:08:36,824;Whatever else he is,
80;00:08:34,409;00:08:36,824;he is a true soldier.
81;00:08:36,825;00:08:39,074;He'd be invaluable at the Wall.
82;00:08:39,075;00:08:41,409;You cannot send me to the Wall.
83;00:08:42,783;00:08:44,409;You are not my queen.
84;00:08:57,867;00:08:59,199;You will have to kill me, too.
85;00:08:59,200;00:09:01,075;Step back and shut your mouth.
86;00:09:02,617;00:09:04,033;Who are you?
87;00:09:04,034;00:09:05,284;A stupid boy.
88;00:09:06,409;00:09:08,616;I am Dickon Tarly,
89;00:09:08,617;00:09:10,033;son of Randyll Tarly.
90;00:09:10,034;00:09:12,241;You are the future

91;00:09:12,242;00:09:15,616;This war has already wiped one
91;00:09:12,242;00:09:15,616;great house from the world.
92;00:09:15,617;00:09:17,492;Don't let it happen again.
92;00:09:15,617;00:09:17,492;Bend the knee.
93;00:09:25,159;00:09:26,617;I will not.
94;00:09:30,950;00:09:34,657;Your Grace, nothing scrubs
94;00:09:30,950;00:09:34,657;bold notions from a man's head
95;00:09:34,658;00:09:36,241;like a few weeks in a dark cell.
96;00:09:36,242;00:09:38,907;I meant what I said.
97;00:09:38,908;00:09:40,450;I'm not here
97;00:09:38,908;00:09:40,450;to put men in chains.
98;00:09:40,451;00:09:42,782;If that becomes an option,
98;00:09:40,451;00:09:42,782;many will take it.
99;00:09:42,783;00:09:44,159;I gave them a choice.
100;00:09:45,658;00:09:46,991;They made it.
101;00:09:46,992;00:09:50,158;Your Grace, if you start
101;00:09:46,992;00:09:50,158;beheading entire families--
102;00:09:50,159;00:09:52,326;I'm not beheading anyone.
103;00:09:57,700;00:09:59,159;Your Grace.

106;00:10:29,700;00:10:32,824;and Mother of Dragons,
107;00:10:32,825;00:10:34,658;sentence you to die.
108;00:10:38,242;00:10:39,409;Dracarys.
109;00:11:27,409;00:11:28,950;My-- my lord...
110;00:11:38,867;00:11:40,451;How many men did we lose?
111;00:11:43,034;00:11:45,075;We haven't done
111;00:11:43,034;00:11:45,075;a full accounting.
112;00:11:46,783;00:11:50,241;It's not only armies
112;00:11:46,783;00:11:50,241;that win wars.
113;00:11:50,242;00:11:52,741;We have the Tyrell gold, we
113;00:11:50,242;00:11:52,741;have the Iron Bank behind us.
114;00:11:52,742;00:11:54,409;We can buy mercenaries.
115;00:11:56,326;00:11:58,199;Not the same as our men,
115;00:11:56,326;00:11:58,199;but they'll fight
116;00:11:58,200;00:12:00,408;if they're well paid,
116;00:11:58,200;00:12:00,408;which they will be.
117;00:12:00,409;00:12:03,866;I just saw the Dothraki fight.
118;00:12:03,867;00:12:05,491;They'll beat any mercenary army.
119;00:12:05,492;00:12:07,575;They'll beat any army
119;00:12:05,492;00:12:07,575;I've ever seen.
120;00:12:07,576;00:12:10,450;Killing our men wasn't war
120;00:12:07,576;00:12:10,450;for them, it was sport.
121;00:12:10,451;00:12:12,657;Her dragon burnt
121;00:12:10,451;00:12:12,657;a thousand wagons.
122;00:12:12,658;00:12:14,907;Qyburn's scorpion fired
122;00:12:12,658;00:12:14,907;bolts bigger than you.
123;00:12:14,908;00:12:17,451;They couldn't stop it.
123;00:12:14,908;00:12:17,451;And she has three of them.
124;00:12:19,492;00:12:21,408;This isn't a war we can win.
125;00:12:21,409;00:12:22,783;So, what do we do?
126;00:12:24,200;00:12:25,451;Sue for peace?
127;00:12:26,783;00:12:28,366;I sit on her father's throne,
128;00:12:28,367;00:12:31,033;the father you betrayed
128;00:12:28,367;00:12:31,033;and murdered.
129;00:12:31,034;00:12:33,866;And in her mind, she's winning.
130;00:12:33,867;00:12:35,950;What sort of offer
130;00:12:33,867;00:12:35,950;do you think she'd make?
131;00:12:38,409;00:12:41,824;Maybe we can count on Tyrion
131;00:12:38,409;00:12:41,824;to intercede on our behalf
132;00:12:41,825;00:12:44,200;by way of apology for
132;00:12:41,825;00:12:44,200;murdering our father and son.
133;00:12:45,950;00:12:47,450;He didn't.
134;00:12:47,451;00:12:49,450;You saw the crossbow,
134;00:12:47,451;00:12:49,450;you saw his body.
135;00:12:49,451;00:12:51,325;I'm not talking about Father.
136;00:12:51,326;00:12:54,866;Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.
136;00:12:51,326;00:12:54,866;He had nothing to do with it.
137;00:12:54,867;00:12:58,159;After all this time, it still amazes me that you--
137;00:12:54,867;00:12:58,159;It was Olenna.
138;00:13:00,534;00:13:02,867;She confessed before she died.
139;00:13:05,159;00:13:07,408;And this was before or after
140;00:13:07,409;00:13:10,491;she drank the poison
140;00:13:07,409;00:13:10,491;you so kindly provided her?
141;00:13:10,492;00:13:12,116;After.
142;00:13:12,117;00:13:13,616;And you believed her?
143;00:13:13,617;00:13:16,366;If you were Olenna,
143;00:13:13,617;00:13:16,366;would you rather have seen
144;00:13:16,367;00:13:19,034;your granddaughter married
144;00:13:16,367;00:13:19,034;to Joffrey or Tommen?
145;00:13:21,409;00:13:23,782;Which one would Margaery have
145;00:13:21,409;00:13:23,782;been better able to control?
146;00:13:23,783;00:13:25,325;Which one would have made Olenna
147;00:13:25,326;00:13:28,033;the true ruler
147;00:13:25,326;00:13:28,033;of the Seven Kingdoms?
148;00:13:28,034;00:13:29,908;She was telling the truth.
149;00:13:37,284;00:13:39,492;I shouldn't have
149;00:13:37,284;00:13:39,492;listened to you.
150;00:13:41,284;00:13:43,074;She should have died screaming.
151;00:13:43,075;00:13:44,366;She's dead, like her son,
152;00:13:44,367;00:13:46,450;her grandchildren,
152;00:13:44,367;00:13:46,450;her whole house.
153;00:13:46,451;00:13:50,033;And if we don't find a way out
153;00:13:46,451;00:13:50,033;of this war, we'll follow them.
154;00:13:50,034;00:13:52,575;So we fight and die
154;00:13:50,034;00:13:52,575;or we submit and die.
155;00:13:52,576;00:13:54,741;I know my choice.
156;00:13:54,742;00:13:57,242;A soldier should know his.
157;00:16:04,367;00:16:06,533;They're beautiful, aren't they?
158;00:16:06,534;00:16:09,326;It wasn't the word
158;00:16:06,534;00:16:09,326;I was thinking of, but...
159;00:16:10,576;00:16:13,325;but, yes, they are.
160;00:16:13,326;00:16:14,824;Gorgeous beasts.
161;00:16:14,825;00:16:16,741;They're not beasts to me.
162;00:16:16,742;00:16:18,575;No matter how big they get
163;00:16:18,576;00:16:20,741;or how terrifying
163;00:16:18,576;00:16:20,741;to everyone else,
164;00:16:20,742;00:16:22,367;they're my children.
165;00:16:28,034;00:16:29,366;You weren't gone long.
166;00:16:29,367;00:16:31,533;No.
167;00:16:31,534;00:16:33,533;And?
168;00:16:33,534;00:16:36,242;And I have fewer enemies
168;00:16:33,534;00:16:36,242;today than I did yesterday.
169;00:16:38,908;00:16:40,991;You're not sure
169;00:16:38,908;00:16:40,991;how you feel about that.
170;00:16:40,992;00:16:42,700;No, I'm not.
171;00:16:44,617;00:16:46,074;How many men did your army kill
172;00:16:46,075;00:16:48,075;taking Winterfell back
172;00:16:46,075;00:16:48,075;from the Boltons?
173;00:16:49,242;00:16:50,616;Thousands.
174;00:16:50,617;00:16:52,741;We both want to help people.
175;00:16:52,742;00:16:56,450;We can only help them
175;00:16:52,742;00:16:56,450;from a position of strength.
176;00:16:56,451;00:16:58,534;Sometimes strength is terrible.
177;00:17:01,742;00:17:04,408;When you first came here,
178;00:17:04,409;00:17:08,158;Ser Davos said you took a knife
178;00:17:04,409;00:17:08,158;in the heart for your people.
179;00:17:08,159;00:17:09,783;Ser Davos gets carried away.
180;00:17:11,534;00:17:13,241;So, it was a figure of speech?
181;00:17:17,742;00:17:21,103;_
182;00:17:27,787;00:17:29,206;_
183;00:17:33,783;00:17:34,982;Your Grace.
184;00:17:40,825;00:17:44,199;Jon Snow, this is
184;00:17:40,825;00:17:44,199;Ser Jorah Mormont,
185;00:17:44,200;00:17:46,450;an old friend.
186;00:17:46,451;00:17:47,949;I served with your father.
187;00:17:47,950;00:17:50,117;He was a great man.
188;00:17:51,658;00:17:53,326;You look strong.
189;00:17:55,159;00:17:56,491;You found a cure?
190;00:17:56,492;00:17:58,450;I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
191;00:17:58,451;00:18:02,949;I return to your
191;00:17:58,451;00:18:02,949;service, my queen,
192;00:18:02,950;00:18:04,741;if you'll have me.
193;00:18:04,742;00:18:07,117;It would be my honor.
194;00:19:46,576;00:19:48,033;Ravens.
195;00:19:48,034;00:19:49,867;We need to send ravens.
196;00:19:52,326;00:19:55,074;I put very little stock
196;00:19:52,326;00:19:55,074;in it myself.
197;00:19:55,075;00:19:57,533;Prophecies of doom
197;00:19:55,075;00:19:57,533;are never in short supply,
198;00:19:57,534;00:19:59,741;especially when winter comes.
199;00:19:59,742;00:20:02,074;I remember Wolkan.
200;00:20:02,075;00:20:04,450;A little timid,
200;00:20:02,075;00:20:04,450;but a sharp mind.
201;00:20:04,451;00:20:07,949;Eh, the North has dulled
201;00:20:04,451;00:20:07,949;many good maesters' wits.
202;00:20:07,950;00:20:10,158;Hard to say whether
202;00:20:07,950;00:20:10,158;it's the cold, the drink,
203;00:20:10,159;00:20:11,949;or the company.
204;00:20:11,950;00:20:14,116;A crippled boy
204;00:20:11,950;00:20:14,116;claims to have seen
205;00:20:14,117;00:20:16,241;dead men on the march
205;00:20:14,117;00:20:16,241;beyond the Wall,
206;00:20:16,242;00:20:19,408;thanks to the magical help
206;00:20:16,242;00:20:19,408;of a raven with three eyes?
207;00:20:19,409;00:20:21,074;Yes, it is a bit much.
208;00:20:21,075;00:20:23,783;Still, we ought to write back--
208;00:20:21,075;00:20:23,783;Brandon Stark.
209;00:20:27,284;00:20:30,451;The crippled boy.
209;00:20:27,284;00:20:30,451;Do you know him?
210;00:20:31,617;00:20:33,782;I led him through
210;00:20:31,617;00:20:33,782;the Wall years ago.
211;00:20:33,783;00:20:36,949;I saw him go beyond the Wall.
212;00:20:36,950;00:20:38,533;And?
213;00:20:38,534;00:20:41,450;Somehow, a crippled boy
214;00:20:41,451;00:20:43,533;survived for years beyond the
214;00:20:41,451;00:20:43,533;Wall when no one else could.
215;00:20:43,534;00:20:47,284;Not the Night's Watch,
215;00:20:43,534;00:20:47,284;not the wildlings, no one.
216;00:20:48,908;00:20:50,991;Perhaps we ought to listen
216;00:20:48,908;00:20:50,991;to what he has to say.
217;00:20:50,992;00:20:54,116;Perhaps you need more scribing
217;00:20:50,992;00:20:54,116;work to discipline your mind.
218;00:20:54,117;00:20:57,534;I sense a more detailed
218;00:20:54,117;00:20:57,534;proposal is forthcoming?
219;00:21:08,159;00:21:12,158;Everyone in Westeros
219;00:21:08,159;00:21:12,158;trusts and respects you.
220;00:21:12,159;00:21:16,325;If you tell people the threat
220;00:21:12,159;00:21:16,325;is real, they'll believe it.
221;00:21:16,326;00:21:18,699;If you advise all the lords
221;00:21:16,326;00:21:18,699;to send their men north
222;00:21:18,700;00:21:20,657;to hold the Wall, they'll do it.
223;00:21:20,658;00:21:24,158;And if you tell every
223;00:21:20,658;00:21:24,158;maester in the Citadel
224;00:21:24,159;00:21:26,491;to search every word
224;00:21:24,159;00:21:26,491;of every faded scroll
225;00:21:26,492;00:21:28,283;about the Long Night,
226;00:21:28,284;00:21:30,116;they may find something
226;00:21:28,284;00:21:30,116;that lets us defeat
227;00:21:30,117;00:21:32,034;the Army of the Dead for good.
228;00:21:37,117;00:21:38,326;It could be done.
229;00:21:39,742;00:21:42,533;And this news
229;00:21:39,742;00:21:42,533;could be authentic.
230;00:21:42,534;00:21:44,200;It's possible.
231;00:21:46,700;00:21:49,033;It's also possible
231;00:21:46,700;00:21:49,033;that this message
232;00:21:49,034;00:21:51,325;is part of a ploy
232;00:21:49,034;00:21:51,325;by the Dragon Queen
233;00:21:51,326;00:21:54,283;to lure southern armies away from the
233;00:21:51,326;00:21:54,283;lands they are currently defending
234;00:21:54,284;00:21:56,325;to open those lands
234;00:21:54,284;00:21:56,325;to easy conquest.
235;00:21:56,326;00:21:58,033;That does
235;00:21:56,326;00:21:58,033;seem far more likely
236;00:21:58,034;00:21:59,991;than magic birds
236;00:21:58,034;00:21:59,991;talking to cripples.
237;00:21:59,992;00:22:02,533;Archmaester, please.
238;00:22:02,534;00:22:03,700;It's real.
239;00:22:05,617;00:22:06,700;I've seen it.
240;00:22:09,534;00:22:11,033;We will write to Maester Wolkan
241;00:22:11,034;00:22:13,408;at Winterfell for clarification.
242;00:22:13,409;00:22:16,283;I promise you we will get to the
242;00:22:13,409;00:22:16,283;truth of it one way or another.
243;00:22:16,284;00:22:18,991;Archmaester, please--
243;00:22:16,284;00:22:18,991;That will be all, Tarly.
244;00:22:18,992;00:22:21,491;It brings to mind the
244;00:22:18,992;00:22:21,491;work of Jenny of Oldstones,
245;00:22:21,492;00:22:24,116;the charlatan who claimed descent
245;00:22:21,492;00:22:24,116;from the children of the forest.
246;00:22:24,117;00:22:26,907;Don't forget the prophet Lodos,
247;00:22:26,908;00:22:30,575;who promised that the Drowned God would
247;00:22:26,908;00:22:30,575;rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.
248;00:22:30,576;00:22:32,867;Ah, Lodos.
249;00:22:36,159;00:22:40,699;Is he the one whose father and
249;00:22:36,159;00:22:40,699;brother were just burnt alive?
250;00:22:40,700;00:22:42,657;I'm afraid so.
251;00:22:42,658;00:22:43,907;Horrible business.
252;00:22:43,908;00:22:46,533;I haven't had the heart
252;00:22:43,908;00:22:46,533;to tell him yet.
253;00:22:46,534;00:22:48,575;He's a good lad.
254;00:22:48,576;00:22:50,325;Right.
255;00:22:50,326;00:22:53,241;The ravenry was falling apart
255;00:22:50,326;00:22:53,241;the last time I checked.
256;00:22:58,451;00:23:01,074;All rulers demand
256;00:22:58,451;00:23:01,074;that people bend the knee.
257;00:23:01,075;00:23:02,284;That's why they're rulers.
258;00:23:05,409;00:23:07,408;She gave Tarly a choice,
259;00:23:07,409;00:23:10,241;a man who had taken up
259;00:23:07,409;00:23:10,241;arms against her.
260;00:23:10,242;00:23:11,991;What else could she do?
261;00:23:11,992;00:23:15,116;Not burn him alive
261;00:23:11,992;00:23:15,116;alongside his son?
262;00:23:15,117;00:23:17,450;I am her Hand, not her head.
263;00:23:17,451;00:23:19,699;I can't make
263;00:23:17,451;00:23:19,699;her decisions for her.
264;00:23:19,700;00:23:22,991;That's what I used to tell
264;00:23:19,700;00:23:22,991;myself about her father.
265;00:23:22,992;00:23:27,366;I found the traitors, but I wasn't
265;00:23:22,992;00:23:27,366;the one burning them alive.
266;00:23:27,367;00:23:30,117;I was only a purveyor
266;00:23:27,367;00:23:30,117;of information.
267;00:23:35,284;00:23:39,325;It's what I told myself when I
267;00:23:35,284;00:23:39,325;watched them beg for mercy--
268;00:23:39,326;00:23:41,907;I'm not the one doing it.
269;00:23:41,908;00:23:44,366;When the pitch of their
269;00:23:41,908;00:23:44,366;screams rose higher--
270;00:23:44,367;00:23:46,408;I'm not the one doing it.
271;00:23:46,409;00:23:47,991;When their hair caught fire
272;00:23:47,992;00:23:50,866;and the smell of their burning
272;00:23:47,992;00:23:50,866;flesh filled the throne room--
273;00:23:50,867;00:23:52,492;I'm not the one doing it.
274;00:24:01,159;00:24:03,366;Daenerys is not her father.
275;00:24:03,367;00:24:05,782;And she never will be
276;00:24:05,783;00:24:07,825;with the right counsel.
277;00:24:11,075;00:24:13,492;You need to find a way
277;00:24:11,075;00:24:13,492;to make her listen.
278;00:24:15,950;00:24:19,325;Who's that for?
278;00:24:15,950;00:24:19,325;Jon Snow.
279;00:24:19,326;00:24:20,866;Did you read it?
280;00:24:20,867;00:24:23,908;It's a sealed scroll
280;00:24:20,867;00:24:23,908;for the King in the North.
281;00:24:30,034;00:24:31,492;What's it say?
282;00:24:32,576;00:24:34,159;Nothing good.
283;00:24:40,658;00:24:44,033;I thought Arya was dead.
284;00:24:44,034;00:24:47,116;I thought Bran was dead.
285;00:24:47,117;00:24:48,534;I'm happy for you.
286;00:24:50,908;00:24:52,325;You don't look happy.
287;00:24:52,326;00:24:54,699;Bran saw the Night King
287;00:24:52,326;00:24:54,699;and his army
288;00:24:54,700;00:24:56,700;marching towards Eastwatch.
289;00:24:58,284;00:25:00,283;If they make it past the Wall...
290;00:25:00,284;00:25:02,991;The Wall has kept them out for
290;00:25:00,284;00:25:02,991;thousands of years, presumably.
291;00:25:02,992;00:25:04,657;I need to go home.
292;00:25:04,658;00:25:06,366;You said you don't
292;00:25:04,658;00:25:06,366;have enough men.
293;00:25:06,367;00:25:08,949;We'll fight
293;00:25:06,367;00:25:08,949;with the men we have.
294;00:25:08,950;00:25:10,575;Unless you'll join us.
295;00:25:10,576;00:25:12,741;And give the country to Cersei?
296;00:25:12,742;00:25:16,575;As soon as I march away,
296;00:25:12,742;00:25:16,575;she marches in.
297;00:25:16,576;00:25:18,907;Perhaps not.
298;00:25:18,908;00:25:22,325;Cersei thinks the Army of the
298;00:25:18,908;00:25:22,325;Dead is nothing but a story
299;00:25:22,326;00:25:25,575;made up by wet nurses
299;00:25:22,326;00:25:25,575;to frighten children.
300;00:25:25,576;00:25:27,325;What if we prove her wrong?
301;00:25:27,326;00:25:30,742;I don't think she'll come see
301;00:25:27,326;00:25:30,742;the dead at my invitation.
302;00:25:32,034;00:25:34,075;So bring the dead to her.
303;00:25:35,534;00:25:37,408;I thought that was what
303;00:25:35,534;00:25:37,408;we were trying to avoid.
304;00:25:37,409;00:25:39,782;We don't have to
304;00:25:37,409;00:25:39,782;bring the whole army.
305;00:25:39,783;00:25:41,824;Only one soldier.
306;00:25:41,825;00:25:43,742;Is that possible?
307;00:25:47,576;00:25:49,283;The first wight I ever saw
308;00:25:49,284;00:25:52,116;was brought into Castle
308;00:25:49,284;00:25:52,116;Black from beyond the Wall.
309;00:25:52,117;00:25:54,450;Bring one of these things
309;00:25:52,117;00:25:54,450;down to King's Landing
310;00:25:54,451;00:25:56,741;and show her the truth.
311;00:25:56,742;00:25:58,782;Anything you bring back
311;00:25:56,742;00:25:58,782;will be useless
312;00:25:58,783;00:26:00,616;unless Cersei
312;00:25:58,783;00:26:00,616;grants us an audience
313;00:26:00,617;00:26:03,158;and is somehow convinced
313;00:26:00,617;00:26:03,158;not to murder us
314;00:26:03,159;00:26:05,408;the moment we set foot
314;00:26:03,159;00:26:05,408;in the capital.
315;00:26:05,409;00:26:08,991;The only person
315;00:26:05,409;00:26:08,991;she listens to is Jaime.
316;00:26:08,992;00:26:10,825;He might listen to me.
317;00:26:14,825;00:26:16,658;And how would you get
317;00:26:14,825;00:26:16,658;into King's Landing?
318;00:26:22,825;00:26:24,657;I can smuggle you in,
319;00:26:24,658;00:26:27,283;but if the gold cloaks
319;00:26:24,658;00:26:27,283;were to recognize you,
320;00:26:27,284;00:26:30,491;I'm warning you,
320;00:26:27,284;00:26:30,491;I'm not a fighter.
321;00:26:30,492;00:26:31,907;Well, it will all be for nothing
322;00:26:31,908;00:26:33,699;if we don't have
322;00:26:31,908;00:26:33,699;one of these dead men.
323;00:26:33,700;00:26:35,074;Fair point.
324;00:26:35,075;00:26:36,367;How do you propose to find one?
325;00:26:39,783;00:26:42,992;With the queen's permission,
325;00:26:39,783;00:26:42,992;I'll go north and take one.
326;00:26:44,700;00:26:48,033;You asked me to find a
326;00:26:44,700;00:26:48,033;cure so I could serve you.
327;00:26:48,034;00:26:49,658;Allow me to serve you.
328;00:26:53,658;00:26:55,158;The Free Folk will help us.
329;00:26:55,159;00:26:57,907;They know the real north
329;00:26:55,159;00:26:57,907;better than anyone.
330;00:26:57,908;00:26:59,450;They won't follow Ser Jorah.
331;00:26:59,451;00:27:00,658;They won't have to.
332;00:27:07,700;00:27:10,116;You can't lead a raid
332;00:27:07,700;00:27:10,116;beyond the Wall.
333;00:27:10,117;00:27:12,741;You're not in the Night's Watch
333;00:27:10,117;00:27:12,741;anymore, you're King in the North.
334;00:27:12,742;00:27:15,325;I'm the only one here
334;00:27:12,742;00:27:15,325;who's fought them.
335;00:27:15,326;00:27:17,700;I'm the only one here
335;00:27:15,326;00:27:17,700;who knows them.
336;00:27:19,075;00:27:21,075;I haven't given you
336;00:27:19,075;00:27:21,075;permission to leave.
337;00:27:23,908;00:27:27,283;With respect, Your Grace,
337;00:27:23,908;00:27:27,283;I don't need your permission.
338;00:27:27,284;00:27:28,492;I am a king.
339;00:27:30,117;00:27:31,533;And I came here
340;00:27:31,534;00:27:33,366;knowing that you could
340;00:27:31,534;00:27:33,366;have your men behead me
341;00:27:33,367;00:27:36,575;or your dragons burn me alive.
342;00:27:36,576;00:27:40,991;I put my trust
342;00:27:36,576;00:27:40,991;in you, a stranger,
343;00:27:40,992;00:27:43,991;because I knew it was the
343;00:27:40,992;00:27:43,991;best chance for my people,
344;00:27:43,992;00:27:46,159;for all our people.
345;00:27:47,700;00:27:52,034;Now I'm asking you
345;00:27:47,700;00:27:52,034;to trust in a stranger...
346;00:27:53,742;00:27:56,242;because it's our best chance.
347;00:28:14,242;00:28:18,576;The King in the North
347;00:28:14,242;00:28:18,576;should stay in the North.
348;00:28:21,117;00:28:25,491;We did not choose you
348;00:28:21,117;00:28:25,491;to rule us, my lady.
349;00:28:25,492;00:28:28,326;But perhaps we should have.
350;00:28:30,825;00:28:35,616;The Knights of the Vale came
350;00:28:30,825;00:28:35,616;here for you, Lady Stark.
351;00:28:35,617;00:28:37,075;Aye.
352;00:28:41,534;00:28:44,949;You are very kind, my lords.
353;00:28:44,950;00:28:46,991;But Jon is our king.
354;00:28:46,992;00:28:49,533;He is doing what
354;00:28:46,992;00:28:49,533;he thinks is best.
355;00:28:59,451;00:29:01,491;I warned Jon
355;00:28:59,451;00:29:01,491;this would happen.
356;00:29:01,492;00:29:03,158;That he couldn't leave the North
357;00:29:03,159;00:29:05,991;and expect it to just sit
357;00:29:03,159;00:29:05,991;and wait for him like Ghost.
358;00:29:05,992;00:29:08,366;He didn't. He trusted
358;00:29:05,992;00:29:08,366;you to hold it for him.
359;00:29:08,367;00:29:11,159;Well, he's not making it easy.
359;00:29:08,367;00:29:11,159;The Northern lords are proud.
360;00:29:15,825;00:29:18,116;These are Mother
360;00:29:15,825;00:29:18,116;and Father's chambers.
361;00:29:18,117;00:29:19,658;And?
362;00:29:22,367;00:29:24,699;Nothing.
363;00:29:24,700;00:29:27,491;Don't do that.
364;00:29:27,492;00:29:29,992;What?
364;00:29:27,492;00:29:29,992;Say what you mean.
365;00:29:31,658;00:29:34,117;You always liked nice things.
366;00:29:35,492;00:29:37,825;They made you feel
366;00:29:35,492;00:29:37,825;better than everyone.
367;00:29:42,742;00:29:44,325;Are you angry with me?
368;00:29:44,326;00:29:46,657;They were insulting Jon,
369;00:29:46,658;00:29:48,033;and you sat there and listened.
370;00:29:48,034;00:29:49,533;I listened to their complaints,
371;00:29:49,534;00:29:52,575;which is my responsibility
371;00:29:49,534;00:29:52,575;as Lady of Winterfell.
372;00:29:52,576;00:29:55,533;Their opinions
372;00:29:52,576;00:29:55,533;are important to you.
373;00:29:55,534;00:29:58,241;Glover has 500 men,
373;00:29:55,534;00:29:58,241;Royce has 2,000.
374;00:29:58,242;00:30:01,199;Offend them
374;00:29:58,242;00:30:01,199;and Jon loses his army.
375;00:30:01,200;00:30:03,200;Not if they lose
375;00:30:01,200;00:30:03,200;their heads first.
376;00:30:06,658;00:30:09,824;Winterfell didn't just
376;00:30:06,658;00:30:09,824;fall into our hands.
377;00:30:09,825;00:30:11,699;We took it back,
378;00:30:11,700;00:30:13,657;and the Mormonts
378;00:30:11,700;00:30:13,657;and the Hornwoods
379;00:30:13,658;00:30:15,116;and the wildlings and the Vale.
380;00:30:15,117;00:30:16,657;All of us, working together.
381;00:30:16,658;00:30:20,991;Now, I'm sure cutting off
381;00:30:16,658;00:30:20,991;heads is very satisfying,
382;00:30:20,992;00:30:24,534;but that's not the way you
382;00:30:20,992;00:30:24,534;get people to work together.
383;00:30:27,700;00:30:29,991;And if Jon doesn't come back,
384;00:30:29,992;00:30:31,949;you'll need their support...
385;00:30:31,950;00:30:34,074;so you can work together
386;00:30:34,075;00:30:36,033;to give you
386;00:30:34,075;00:30:36,033;what you really want.
387;00:30:36,034;00:30:38,617;How can you even think
387;00:30:36,034;00:30:38,617;such a horrible thing?
388;00:30:41,326;00:30:43,367;You're thinking it right now.
389;00:30:45,367;00:30:48,325;You don't want to be,
390;00:30:48,326;00:30:50,617;but the thought
390;00:30:48,326;00:30:50,617;just won't go away.
391;00:30:56,534;00:30:58,409;I have work to do.
392;00:31:02,075;00:31:03,367;My lady.
393;00:31:15,409;00:31:18,657;Last time I was here, I killed
393;00:31:15,409;00:31:18,657;my father with a crossbow.
394;00:31:18,658;00:31:21,617;Last time I was here, you
394;00:31:18,658;00:31:21,617;killed my son with wildfire.
395;00:31:24,783;00:31:27,616;There's a path to the left
395;00:31:24,783;00:31:27,616;that hugs the cliff.
396;00:31:27,617;00:31:30,283;The guards
396;00:31:27,617;00:31:30,283;hardly ever patrol it.
397;00:31:30,284;00:31:31,658;Too many steps.
398;00:31:36,534;00:31:37,824;You're not staying here?
399;00:31:37,825;00:31:41,325;I've got my own business
399;00:31:37,825;00:31:41,325;in Flea Bottom.
400;00:31:41,326;00:31:43,158;What if someone takes the boat?
401;00:31:43,159;00:31:45,451;Then we're fucked.
401;00:31:43,159;00:31:45,451;Best hurry.
402;00:31:50,867;00:31:52,283;We don't have time for this.
403;00:31:52,284;00:31:54,450;We should be preparing
403;00:31:52,284;00:31:54,450;the city for a siege.
404;00:31:54,451;00:31:55,616;The Dothraki are coming.
405;00:31:55,617;00:31:57,741;All the more reason
405;00:31:55,617;00:31:57,741;for you to train.
406;00:31:57,742;00:31:59,741;Unless you plan on fighting
406;00:31:57,742;00:31:59,741;Dothraki 12-year-olds.
407;00:31:59,742;00:32:02,283;Well, I seem to recall them giving
407;00:31:59,742;00:32:02,283;you a bit of trouble as well.
408;00:32:02,284;00:32:04,283;And here I am, ready to train.
409;00:32:04,284;00:32:06,241;Why down here?
410;00:32:06,242;00:32:08,074;I don't think
410;00:32:06,242;00:32:08,074;you want people to see
411;00:32:08,075;00:32:10,991;how you look swinging
411;00:32:08,075;00:32:10,991;that thing yet.
412;00:32:10,992;00:32:13,782;Today might be the day
412;00:32:10,992;00:32:13,782;I kill you by accident.
413;00:32:13,783;00:32:16,326;Oh, you won't be
413;00:32:13,783;00:32:16,326;swinging it at me.
414;00:32:24,534;00:32:26,200;I'll leave you to it.
415;00:32:29,992;00:32:31,326;I needed to see you.
416;00:32:32,783;00:32:34,617;And I knew you'd
416;00:32:32,783;00:32:34,617;never agree to meet.
417;00:32:38,159;00:32:41,116;You made me look
417;00:32:38,159;00:32:41,116;like a complete fool.
418;00:32:41,117;00:32:43,408;I thought I'd surprise you
418;00:32:41,117;00:32:43,408;by hitting Casterly Rock,
419;00:32:43,409;00:32:46,366;but you were
419;00:32:43,409;00:32:46,366;three steps ahead of me.
420;00:32:46,367;00:32:48,949;Abandoned the family home,
420;00:32:46,367;00:32:48,949;completely unsentimental.
421;00:32:48,950;00:32:50,450;Father would have been proud.
422;00:32:50,451;00:32:52,199;Don't talk about Father.
422;00:32:50,451;00:32:52,199;Listen to me--
423;00:32:52,200;00:32:53,699;I once told Bronn
424;00:32:53,700;00:32:56,534;that if I ever saw you
424;00:32:53,700;00:32:56,534;again, I'd cut you in half.
425;00:32:59,534;00:33:02,034;It'll take you a while
425;00:32:59,534;00:33:02,034;with a sparring sword.
426;00:33:11,200;00:33:13,116;He was going to execute me.
427;00:33:13,117;00:33:15,824;He knew I was innocent.
428;00:33:15,825;00:33:18,158;He didn't hate me
428;00:33:15,825;00:33:18,158;because of anything I did,
429;00:33:18,159;00:33:20,533;he hated me
429;00:33:18,159;00:33:20,533;because of what I am.
430;00:33:20,534;00:33:23,700;A little monster
430;00:33:20,534;00:33:23,700;sent to punish him.
431;00:33:25,576;00:33:27,782;Did he--
431;00:33:25,576;00:33:27,782;did he think--
432;00:33:27,783;00:33:29,575;did he think I wanted
432;00:33:27,783;00:33:29,575;to be born this way?
433;00:33:29,576;00:33:31,456;Did he think I chose it--
433;00:33:29,576;00:33:31,456;What do you want?!
434;00:33:37,992;00:33:39,534;Daenerys will win this war.
435;00:33:41,908;00:33:43,325;You're a military man.
436;00:33:43,326;00:33:46,075;You must know there's
436;00:33:43,326;00:33:46,075;no way around that.
437;00:33:48,117;00:33:49,699;Daenerys is not her father.
438;00:33:49,700;00:33:52,575;She's even willing
438;00:33:49,700;00:33:52,575;to suspend the hostilities
439;00:33:52,576;00:33:55,075;if Cersei agrees
439;00:33:52,576;00:33:55,075;to certain terms.
440;00:33:56,242;00:33:57,616;If you want Cersei
440;00:33:56,242;00:33:57,616;to bend the knee,
441;00:33:57,617;00:33:59,074;you can ask her yourself.
442;00:33:59,075;00:34:01,451;I-- I don't.
442;00:33:59,075;00:34:01,451;And Daenerys doesn't.
443;00:34:02,867;00:34:04,576;Not right now, anyway.
444;00:34:06,742;00:34:08,992;She has a more
444;00:34:06,742;00:34:08,992;important request.
445;00:34:48,492;00:34:50,700;I wasn't sure I'd find you.
446;00:34:57,992;00:34:59,991;Thought you might
446;00:34:57,992;00:34:59,991;still be rowing.
447;00:35:03,617;00:35:06,699;I looked in shops,
447;00:35:03,617;00:35:06,699;taverns, brothels.
448;00:35:06,700;00:35:09,991;Should have known to come
448;00:35:06,700;00:35:09,991;straight to the Street of Steel.
449;00:35:09,992;00:35:12,491;Aren't you worried
449;00:35:09,992;00:35:12,491;about the gold cloaks?
450;00:35:12,492;00:35:13,907;Haven't been here in years.
451;00:35:13,908;00:35:16,325;Why should they recognize me?
452;00:35:16,326;00:35:18,992;Sometimes I hardly do.
453;00:35:20,658;00:35:22,825;Nothing fucks you
453;00:35:20,658;00:35:22,825;harder than time.
454;00:35:27,617;00:35:29,699;Anybody give you any trouble?
455;00:35:29,700;00:35:32,158;Here I am, arming Lannisters,
456;00:35:32,159;00:35:34,033;and I never get a second look.
457;00:35:34,034;00:35:35,533;But you were right.
458;00:35:35,534;00:35:38,074;Safest place for me was
458;00:35:35,534;00:35:38,074;right under the queen's nose.
459;00:35:38,075;00:35:39,575;Don't be so sure.
460;00:35:39,576;00:35:42,492;Safety is never a permanent
460;00:35:39,576;00:35:42,492;state of affairs.
461;00:35:44,700;00:35:46,242;Bad things are coming.
462;00:35:48,742;00:35:51,963;You came to get me.
462;00:35:48,742;00:35:51,963;You want me to come with you.
463;00:35:52,083;00:35:53,122;Well, the thing you need to
463;00:35:52,083;00:35:53,122;understand is--
464;00:35:53,242;00:35:53,812;I'm ready.
465;00:35:53,932;00:35:55,283;You--
465;00:35:53,932;00:35:55,283;Let's go.
466;00:35:55,284;00:35:57,199;You should know
466;00:35:55,284;00:35:57,199;what you're heading into.
467;00:35:57,200;00:35:59,199;What do you think
467;00:35:57,200;00:35:59,199;I've been thinking about
468;00:35:59,200;00:36:00,575;with every swing of the hammer?
469;00:36:00,576;00:36:03,033;How happy I am making weapons
470;00:36:03,034;00:36:05,491;for the family
470;00:36:03,034;00:36:05,491;that killed my father?
471;00:36:05,492;00:36:07,199;The family that
471;00:36:05,492;00:36:07,199;tried to kill me?
472;00:36:09,326;00:36:11,575;I've been getting ready.
473;00:36:11,576;00:36:13,033;I never knew what for,
474;00:36:13,034;00:36:15,576;but I've always known
474;00:36:13,034;00:36:15,576;I'd know it when it comes.
475;00:36:17,242;00:36:20,325;You might want to bring
475;00:36:17,242;00:36:20,325;one of those swords.
476;00:36:20,326;00:36:22,242;I don't know much
476;00:36:20,326;00:36:22,242;about swinging swords.
477;00:36:23,742;00:36:25,075;But this...
478;00:36:26,908;00:36:28,242;this I know.
479;00:36:37,326;00:36:38,741;Keep your father's name
479;00:36:37,326;00:36:38,741;to yourself.
480;00:36:38,742;00:36:41,534;Situation's complicated
480;00:36:38,742;00:36:41,534;enough already.
481;00:36:42,908;00:36:44,576;Well, who should I say I am?
482;00:36:48,409;00:36:50,824;I told you, Clovis, if we
482;00:36:48,409;00:36:50,824;don't get out of here soon,
483;00:36:50,825;00:36:52,665;someone's going to--
483;00:36:50,825;00:36:52,665;You there!
484;00:36:54,950;00:36:57,284;No weapons, friends.
484;00:36:54,950;00:36:57,284;I promise.
485;00:36:58,492;00:36:59,949;What can I do for you?
486;00:36:59,950;00:37:02,450;Is that your boat?
486;00:36:59,950;00:37:02,450;It is.
487;00:37:02,451;00:37:04,866;The docks are that way.
487;00:37:02,451;00:37:04,866;That they are.
488;00:37:04,867;00:37:06,366;I try to stay away from them
489;00:37:06,367;00:37:08,617;to avoid good men
489;00:37:06,367;00:37:08,617;such as yourselves.
490;00:37:11,242;00:37:14,616;Still five gold dragons?
490;00:37:11,242;00:37:14,616;Are you joking?
491;00:37:14,617;00:37:16,866;You must be even older
491;00:37:14,617;00:37:16,866;than you look.
492;00:37:16,867;00:37:18,782;15.
492;00:37:16,867;00:37:18,782;15?!
493;00:37:18,783;00:37:19,908;Apiece.
494;00:37:28,326;00:37:30,451;I can't say it was a pleasure
494;00:37:28,326;00:37:30,451;doing business with you.
495;00:37:32,950;00:37:34,326;What's in the boat?
496;00:37:39,867;00:37:41,033;Not more gold.
497;00:37:41,034;00:37:42,782;Wine?
497;00:37:41,034;00:37:42,782;Mm.
498;00:37:42,783;00:37:44,783;I like wine.
498;00:37:42,783;00:37:44,783;Or hams.
499;00:37:46,700;00:37:47,825;Come have a look.
500;00:37:56,367;00:37:58,283;Fermented crab.
500;00:37:56,367;00:37:58,283;What?
501;00:37:58,284;00:38:00,158;Fermented crab.
502;00:38:00,159;00:38:03,158;One bucket of this triples a
502;00:38:00,159;00:38:03,158;brothel's earnings for the week.
503;00:38:03,159;00:38:05,116;A man thinks he's done.
504;00:38:05,117;00:38:07,699;He's ready to go back
504;00:38:05,117;00:38:07,699;to his loving family.
505;00:38:07,700;00:38:09,616;But before he gets
505;00:38:07,700;00:38:09,616;his breeches up,
506;00:38:09,617;00:38:12,991;his lady of the hour pops a tiny
506;00:38:09,617;00:38:12,991;spoon of that into his mouth.
507;00:38:12,992;00:38:16,533;Five minutes later,
507;00:38:12,992;00:38:16,533;he's back in the race.
508;00:38:16,534;00:38:19,034;Here, have a taste.
509;00:38:31,700;00:38:33,575;I'd hurry to your
509;00:38:31,700;00:38:33,575;favorite establishment,
510;00:38:33,576;00:38:36,074;or you'll put a hole
510;00:38:33,576;00:38:36,074;in that chainmail.
511;00:39:03,075;00:39:05,075;Oi, dwarf!
512;00:39:06,409;00:39:07,949;I really wouldn't try any more
513;00:39:07,950;00:39:09,991;until you see how
513;00:39:07,950;00:39:09,991;the first bite hits you.
514;00:39:09,992;00:39:11,866;That dwarf...
515;00:39:11,867;00:39:13,491;Where'd you get that scar?
516;00:39:13,492;00:39:16,033;Fish hook. Some men
516;00:39:13,492;00:39:16,033;you just can't teach.
517;00:39:16,034;00:39:19,116;We was looking for a dwarf with
517;00:39:16,034;00:39:19,116;a scar like that a while back.
518;00:39:19,117;00:39:21,158;Perhaps there's
518;00:39:19,117;00:39:21,158;some arrangement?
519;00:39:23,576;00:39:25,533;Arrangement?
520;00:39:25,534;00:39:28,741;You gonna arrange to pay us
520;00:39:25,534;00:39:28,741;more than Queen Cersei--
521;00:39:36,576;00:39:38,283;This is Gendry.
522;00:39:38,284;00:39:39,783;He'll do.
523;00:39:42,492;00:39:43,492;Go, go, go.
524;00:39:46,284;00:39:47,782;I could give you something.
525;00:39:47,783;00:39:49,284;That won't be necessary.
526;00:39:57,950;00:39:58,950;Ser Jaime.
527;00:40:01,783;00:40:04,451;Why was Qyburn here?
528;00:40:05,867;00:40:08,117;He's the Hand of the Queen.
528;00:40:05,867;00:40:08,117;Why are you here?
529;00:40:12,783;00:40:15,326;I met with Tyrion.
530;00:40:23,200;00:40:25,950;What did our brother
530;00:40:23,200;00:40:25,950;have to say?
531;00:40:28,534;00:40:30,991;Daenerys wants to meet.
532;00:40:30,992;00:40:33,616;To discuss her surrender?
533;00:40:33,617;00:40:35,450;To discuss an armistice.
534;00:40:35,451;00:40:38,241;She's just won a great victory.
534;00:40:35,451;00:40:38,241;Why would she want a truce now?
535;00:40:38,242;00:40:39,991;Because an army of dead men
536;00:40:39,992;00:40:42,534;is marching
536;00:40:39,992;00:40:42,534;on the Seven Kingdoms.
537;00:40:45,034;00:40:46,866;Tyrion claims he'll have proof.
538;00:40:50,742;00:40:53,116;Are you going to punish him?
538;00:40:50,742;00:40:53,116;Tyrion?
539;00:40:53,117;00:40:54,617;Bronn.
540;00:40:57,159;00:40:59,533;He betrayed you.
541;00:40:59,534;00:41:01,908;He set up a meeting without
541;00:40:59,534;00:41:01,908;your knowledge or consent.
542;00:41:05,742;00:41:07,033;Do you think
542;00:41:05,742;00:41:07,033;anything of importance
543;00:41:07,034;00:41:09,533;happens in this city
543;00:41:07,034;00:41:09,533;without me knowing?
544;00:41:09,534;00:41:12,782;You let it happen.
544;00:41:09,534;00:41:12,782;Why?
545;00:41:12,783;00:41:15,450;I've come to believe that
546;00:41:15,451;00:41:18,158;an accommodation
546;00:41:15,451;00:41:18,158;with the Dragon Queen
547;00:41:18,159;00:41:20,699;could be in our
547;00:41:18,159;00:41:20,699;immediate interest.
548;00:41:20,700;00:41:24,033;She has the numbers. If we want to
548;00:41:20,700;00:41:24,033;beat her, we have to be clever.
549;00:41:24,034;00:41:26,200;We have to fight her
549;00:41:24,034;00:41:26,200;like Father would have.
550;00:41:29,658;00:41:32,825;Dead men, dragons,
550;00:41:29,658;00:41:32,825;and Dragon Queens...
551;00:41:34,867;00:41:37,866;Whatever stands in our way,
552;00:41:37,867;00:41:39,616;we will defeat it.
553;00:41:39,617;00:41:42,408;For ourselves, for our house,
554;00:41:42,409;00:41:44,409;for this.
555;00:41:57,034;00:41:58,616;Who will you say is the father?
556;00:41:58,617;00:41:59,908;You.
557;00:42:05,825;00:42:07,075;People won't like that.
558;00:42:10,700;00:42:15,116;Do you remember what Father
558;00:42:10,700;00:42:15,116;used to say about people?
559;00:42:15,117;00:42:19,075;The lion does not concern himself
559;00:42:15,117;00:42:19,075;with the opinions of the sheep.
560;00:42:32,992;00:42:34,950;Never betray me again.
561;00:42:40,034;00:42:41,949;We're leaving today.
562;00:42:41,950;00:42:45,533;The king's got a lot on his mind.
562;00:42:41,950;00:42:45,533;I understand.
563;00:42:45,534;00:42:48,116;He doesn't need to be thinking about
563;00:42:45,534;00:42:48,116;harboring the bastard of a dead king.
564;00:42:48,117;00:42:50,575;You don't have to worry.
564;00:42:48,117;00:42:50,575;You're just Clovis,
565;00:42:50,576;00:42:52,907;a smith who's come
565;00:42:50,576;00:42:52,907;to pay his respects
566;00:42:52,908;00:42:55,907;before he heads off to work
566;00:42:52,908;00:42:55,907;at the Winterfell forges.
567;00:42:55,908;00:42:57,907;Understood.
568;00:42:59,367;00:43:01,533;Begging your pardon, Your Grace.
569;00:43:01,534;00:43:02,991;You survived King's Landing.
570;00:43:02,992;00:43:05,991;Yet again. Your
570;00:43:02,992;00:43:05,991;Grace, this is Clo--
571;00:43:05,992;00:43:08,408;Name's Gendry, Your Grace.
572;00:43:08,409;00:43:09,991;I'm Robert Baratheon's son.
573;00:43:09,992;00:43:11,117;Bastard son.
574;00:43:14,200;00:43:16,657;He was meant
574;00:43:14,200;00:43:16,657;to keep that to himself.
575;00:43:16,658;00:43:18,491;Our fathers trusted each other.
576;00:43:18,492;00:43:19,825;Why shouldn't we?
577;00:43:22,117;00:43:24,616;I saw your father once
577;00:43:22,117;00:43:24,616;at Winterfell.
578;00:43:24,617;00:43:27,825;I met yours in my shop.
579;00:43:29,534;00:43:31,867;You're a lot leaner.
579;00:43:29,534;00:43:31,867;And you're a lot shorter.
580;00:43:41,950;00:43:45,741;I grew up on stories about them.
581;00:43:45,742;00:43:48,742;All I ever knew is that
581;00:43:45,742;00:43:48,742;they fought together and won.
582;00:43:50,492;00:43:53,283;Ser Davos told me where you're
582;00:43:50,492;00:43:53,283;going, Your Grace, and why.
583;00:43:53,284;00:43:55,074;Let me come with you.
584;00:43:55,075;00:43:56,949;Don't be a fool.
584;00:43:55,075;00:43:56,949;You're not a soldier.
585;00:43:56,950;00:43:58,782;No, but I'm a fighter.
586;00:43:58,783;00:44:01,867;And he won't be needing a
586;00:43:58,783;00:44:01,867;smith with a sword like that.
587;00:44:04,284;00:44:05,782;You know how to use one?
588;00:44:05,783;00:44:08,158;Well, that's a problem.
589;00:44:08,159;00:44:09,700;I prefer a hammer.
590;00:44:12,700;00:44:14,409;He can handle himself.
591;00:44:16,200;00:44:18,283;We could use the help.
592;00:44:18,284;00:44:20,158;As my father used to say,
593;00:44:20,159;00:44:22,241;It's better to be
593;00:44:20,159;00:44:22,241;a coward for a minute,
594;00:44:22,242;00:44:24,491;than dead for
594;00:44:22,242;00:44:24,491;the rest of your life.
595;00:44:24,492;00:44:26,907;I owe you my life.
596;00:44:26,908;00:44:28,699;Twice over.
597;00:44:28,700;00:44:31,949;But if what you said is true
597;00:44:28,700;00:44:31,949;about what's up there,
598;00:44:31,950;00:44:34,409;I can't wait out this war.
599;00:44:38,200;00:44:40,116;Yeah, nobody mind me.
600;00:44:40,117;00:44:44,158;All I've ever done
600;00:44:40,117;00:44:44,158;is live to a ripe old age.
601;00:44:44,159;00:44:46,074;All right, come on.
602;00:44:55,658;00:44:57,907;You may not believe it,
603;00:44:57,908;00:45:00,616;but I've missed you, Mormont.
604;00:45:00,617;00:45:03,741;Nobody glowers quite like you.
605;00:45:03,742;00:45:05,034;Not even Grey Worm.
606;00:45:10,825;00:45:12,782;This is the coin
606;00:45:10,825;00:45:12,782;the slaver gave me
607;00:45:12,783;00:45:15,782;when I suggested he free us
607;00:45:12,783;00:45:15,782;and pay us, remember?
608;00:45:15,783;00:45:19,617;It was supposed to last us
608;00:45:15,783;00:45:19,617;the rest of our lives.
609;00:45:24,075;00:45:25,451;Take it with you.
610;00:45:28,117;00:45:29,616;But bring it back.
611;00:45:29,617;00:45:30,783;Our queen needs you.
612;00:45:40,159;00:45:42,617;We should be better
612;00:45:40,159;00:45:42,617;at saying farewell by now.
613;00:45:44,284;00:45:45,783;Your Grace, I...
614;00:46:03,200;00:46:05,450;If I don't return, at least
614;00:46:03,200;00:46:05,450;you won't have to deal
615;00:46:05,451;00:46:06,811;with the King
615;00:46:05,451;00:46:06,811;in the North anymore.
616;00:46:09,117;00:46:10,992;I've grown used to him.
617;00:46:13,075;00:46:15,700;I wish you good fortune in the
617;00:46:13,075;00:46:15,700;wars to come, Your Grace.
618;00:46:24,783;00:46:26,451;Heave!
619;00:46:49,576;00:46:54,033;Do you know how many
619;00:46:49,576;00:46:54,033;steps there are in the Citadel?
620;00:46:54,034;00:46:55,241;No.
621;00:46:55,242;00:46:58,200;15,782.
622;00:47:02,783;00:47:06,200;Guess how many windows are
622;00:47:02,783;00:47:06,200;in the Great Sept of Baelor.
623;00:47:08,326;00:47:10,866;None anymore.
624;00:47:10,867;00:47:12,533;That's true.
625;00:47:12,534;00:47:16,866;This High Septon Maynard,
625;00:47:12,534;00:47:16,866;he recorded everything.
626;00:47:16,867;00:47:19,075;He even recorded
626;00:47:16,867;00:47:19,075;his own bowel movements.
627;00:47:22,617;00:47:25,824;What does annulment mean?
628;00:47:25,825;00:47:29,699;It's when a man
628;00:47:25,825;00:47:29,699;sets aside his lawful wife.
629;00:47:29,700;00:47:35,074;Maynard says here that he issued
629;00:47:29,700;00:47:35,074;an annulment for a Prince Ragger
630;00:47:35,075;00:47:38,575;and remarried him to someone
630;00:47:35,075;00:47:38,575;else at the same time
631;00:47:38,576;00:47:41,116;in a secret ceremony in Dorne.
632;00:47:41,117;00:47:43,033;Is that a common thing
632;00:47:41,117;00:47:43,033;in the south or--?
633;00:47:43,034;00:47:44,409;These maesters...
634;00:47:46,284;00:47:49,866;they set me to the task of preserving
634;00:47:46,284;00:47:49,866;that man's window counting
635;00:47:49,867;00:47:52,158;and annulments and bowel
635;00:47:49,867;00:47:52,158;movements for all eternity,
636;00:47:52,159;00:47:53,949;while the secret to
636;00:47:52,159;00:47:53,949;defeating the Night King's
637;00:47:53,950;00:47:56,616;probably sitting on some dusty shelf
637;00:47:53,950;00:47:56,616;somewhere, completely ignored.
638;00:47:56,617;00:47:58,533;But that's all right, isn't it?
639;00:47:58,534;00:48:02,616;We can all become slavering, murderous
639;00:47:58,534;00:48:02,616;imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate
640;00:48:02,617;00:48:04,241;as long as we can have access
640;00:48:02,617;00:48:04,241;to the full records
641;00:48:04,242;00:48:08,284;of High Septon Maynard's
641;00:48:04,242;00:48:08,284;15,782 shits!
642;00:48:10,617;00:48:12,242;Steps.
643;00:48:15,284;00:48:17,409;That number was the steps.
644;00:49:39,367;00:49:41,949;Are you sure
644;00:49:39,367;00:49:41,949;you want to do this?
645;00:49:41,950;00:49:44,367;You always wanted
645;00:49:41,950;00:49:44,367;to be a maester.
646;00:49:45,992;00:49:50,159;I'm tired of reading about
646;00:49:45,992;00:49:50,159;the achievements of better men.
647;00:51:19,242;00:51:21,117;I found it, my lord.
648;00:51:24,825;00:51:26,533;It, uh, took some searching.
649;00:51:26,534;00:51:28,617;Maester Luwin's archives
649;00:51:26,534;00:51:28,617;are very thorough.
650;00:51:33,326;00:51:35,949;You're sure this is the
650;00:51:33,326;00:51:35,949;only copy in Winterfell?
651;00:51:35,950;00:51:37,825;Uh, yes, my lord.
652;00:51:42,617;00:51:44,534;Lady Stark thanks you
652;00:51:42,617;00:51:44,534;for your service.
653;00:54:16,658;00:54:18,533;Isn't it your
653;00:54:16,658;00:54:18,533;job to talk him out
654;00:54:18,534;00:54:20,533;of stupid fucking
654;00:54:18,534;00:54:20,533;ideas like this?
655;00:54:20,534;00:54:23,326;I've been failing
655;00:54:20,534;00:54:23,326;at that job of late.
656;00:54:24,950;00:54:26,991;How many queens are there now?
657;00:54:26,992;00:54:28,325;Two.
658;00:54:28,326;00:54:31,491;And you need to convince
658;00:54:28,326;00:54:31,491;the one with the dragons
659;00:54:31,492;00:54:33,325;or the one who
659;00:54:31,492;00:54:33,325;fucks her brother?
660;00:54:35,159;00:54:36,159;Both.
661;00:54:36,160;00:54:38,200;How many men did you bring?
662;00:54:41,284;00:54:42,824;Not enough.
663;00:54:42,825;00:54:44,451;The big woman?
664;00:54:47,783;00:54:50,575;We were hoping some of
664;00:54:47,783;00:54:50,575;your men could help.
665;00:54:50,576;00:54:53,408;Hmm.
665;00:54:50,576;00:54:53,408;I'll be staying behind.
666;00:54:53,409;00:54:56,533;I'm a liability out there,
666;00:54:53,409;00:54:56,533;as you well know.
667;00:54:56,534;00:54:57,534;You are.
668;00:55:00,326;00:55:03,534;You really want to go out there?
668;00:55:00,326;00:55:03,534;Again?
669;00:55:09,825;00:55:11,576;You're not the only ones.
670;00:55:15,200;00:55:18,699;My scouts found them
670;00:55:15,200;00:55:18,699;a mile south of the Wall.
671;00:55:18,700;00:55:20,576;Said they were
671;00:55:18,700;00:55:20,576;on their way here.
672;00:55:27,409;00:55:28,867;You're the Hound.
673;00:55:30,867;00:55:32,700;I saw you once at Winterfell.
674;00:55:38,409;00:55:40,575;They want to go
674;00:55:38,409;00:55:40,575;beyond the Wall, too.
675;00:55:40,576;00:55:43,866;We don't want to go beyond
675;00:55:40,576;00:55:43,866;the Wall, we have to.
676;00:55:43,867;00:55:46,033;Our Lord told us that
676;00:55:43,867;00:55:46,033;the Great War is coming--
677;00:55:46,034;00:55:48,241;Don't trust him.
678;00:55:48,242;00:55:50,200;Don't trust any of them.
679;00:55:55,825;00:55:57,450;They're the Brotherhood.
680;00:55:57,451;00:56:00,033;And the last thing
680;00:55:57,451;00:56:00,033;their lord told them to do
681;00:56:00,034;00:56:02,408;was sell me to a red witch
681;00:56:00,034;00:56:02,408;to be murdered.
682;00:56:02,409;00:56:04,117;Thoros?
683;00:56:09,159;00:56:11,241;I hardly recognized you.
684;00:56:11,242;00:56:13,450;Ser Jorah Mormont.
685;00:56:13,451;00:56:16,408;They won't give me anything
685;00:56:13,451;00:56:16,408;to drink down here.
686;00:56:16,409;00:56:19,450;I haven't been feeling
686;00:56:16,409;00:56:19,450;like myself.
687;00:56:19,451;00:56:22,283;You're a fucking Mormont?
688;00:56:22,284;00:56:24,408;Like the last Lord Commander?
689;00:56:24,409;00:56:26,616;He was my father.
690;00:56:26,617;00:56:29,616;He hunted us like animals.
691;00:56:29,617;00:56:32,657;You returned the favor,
691;00:56:29,617;00:56:32,657;as I recall.
692;00:56:34,326;00:56:36,949;Here we all are
693;00:56:36,950;00:56:38,533;at the edge of the world
694;00:56:38,534;00:56:40,116;at the same moment,
695;00:56:40,117;00:56:42,617;heading in the same direction
695;00:56:40,117;00:56:42,617;for the same reason.
696;00:56:44,451;00:56:46,699;Our reasons aren't your reasons.
697;00:56:46,700;00:56:49,075;It doesn't matter
697;00:56:46,700;00:56:49,075;what we think our reasons are.
698;00:56:51,284;00:56:53,074;There's a greater
698;00:56:51,284;00:56:53,074;purpose at work.
699;00:56:53,075;00:56:56,366;And we serve it together,
700;00:56:56,367;00:56:58,657;whether we know it or not.
701;00:56:58,658;00:57:01,575;We may take the steps,
701;00:56:58,658;00:57:01,575;but the Lord of Light--
702;00:57:01,576;00:57:04,949;For fuck's sake,
702;00:57:01,576;00:57:04,949;will you shut your hole?
703;00:57:04,950;00:57:07,741;Are we coming with you or not?
704;00:57:07,742;00:57:09,949;Don't you want to know
704;00:57:07,742;00:57:09,949;what we're doing?
705;00:57:09,950;00:57:14,366;Is it worse than sitting in a
705;00:57:09,950;00:57:14,366;freezing cell, waiting to die?
706;00:57:14,367;00:57:16,366;He's right.
707;00:57:16,367;00:57:18,367;We're all on the same side.
708;00:57:20,867;00:57:21,992;How can we be?
709;00:57:23,617;00:57:25,700;We're all breathing.
