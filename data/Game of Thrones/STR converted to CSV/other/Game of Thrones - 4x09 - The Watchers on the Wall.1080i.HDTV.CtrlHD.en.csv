1;00:04:09,732;00:04:11,984;What was she like?

2;00:04:14,404;00:04:16,321;She...

3;00:04:18,157;00:04:20,626;she had red hair.

4;00:04:22,245;00:04:24,296;Oh?

5;00:04:24,330;00:04:26,748;How big were her feet?

5;00:04:24,330;00:04:26,748;What do you want me to say?

6;00:04:26,799;00:04:30,135;I want you to tell me what

6;00:04:26,799;00:04:30,135;it was like to have someone.

7;00:04:30,169;00:04:32,137;To be with someone.

8;00:04:32,171;00:04:33,972;To love someone and have

8;00:04:32,171;00:04:33,972;them love you back.

9;00:04:38,061;00:04:41,396;We're all gonna die a lot

9;00:04:38,061;00:04:41,396;sooner than I'd planned.

10;00:04:41,431;00:04:45,067;You're the closest

10;00:04:41,431;00:04:45,067;I'll ever get to knowing.

11;00:04:48,604;00:04:50,221;So you and Gilly never?

12;00:04:50,239;00:04:51,556;No.

13;00:04:51,574;00:04:53,859;She just had a baby.

14;00:04:56,579;00:04:58,063;And she never offered.

15;00:04:58,081;00:05:00,532;But if she had,

16;00:05:00,566;00:05:03,234;you would have?

17;00:05:03,252;00:05:06,038;You'd have broken

17;00:05:03,252;00:05:06,038;your vows?

18;00:05:09,959;00:05:12,044;The interesting

18;00:05:09,959;00:05:12,044;thing is,

19;00:05:12,078;00:05:15,130;our vows never

19;00:05:12,078;00:05:15,130;specifically forbid

20;00:05:15,181;00:05:17,182;intimate relations

20;00:05:15,181;00:05:17,182;with women.

21;00:05:17,216;00:05:18,850;What?

22;00:05:18,885;00:05:22,304;I shall take no wife, yes, that's

22;00:05:18,885;00:05:22,304;in there. There's no denying that.

23;00:05:22,355;00:05:24,773;I shall father no children.

23;00:05:22,355;00:05:24,773;It's very specific.

24;00:05:24,807;00:05:27,592;But what do our vows

24;00:05:24,807;00:05:27,592;have to say about other...

25;00:05:27,610;00:05:30,779;activities is open

25;00:05:27,610;00:05:30,779;to interpretation.

26;00:05:32,765;00:05:36,234;I don't think Ser Alliser

26;00:05:32,765;00:05:36,234;cares much for interpretation.

27;00:05:40,573;00:05:43,742;Anyway, there's nothing

27;00:05:40,573;00:05:43,742;for him to interpret.

28;00:05:43,776;00:05:45,744;We didn't.

29;00:05:49,165;00:05:51,133;So what's it like?

30;00:05:52,885;00:05:54,720;It's...

31;00:05:56,005;00:05:59,758;there's this person,

31;00:05:56,005;00:05:59,758;this whole other person.

32;00:05:59,792;00:06:03,178;And you're wrapped up in them

32;00:05:59,792;00:06:03,178;and they're wrapped up in you.

33;00:06:03,229;00:06:05,397;And you--

34;00:06:05,431;00:06:07,432;for a little--

35;00:06:07,466;00:06:09,768;for a little while,

35;00:06:07,466;00:06:09,768;you're more than just you.

36;00:06:09,802;00:06:13,071;You're-- I don't know.

36;00:06:09,802;00:06:13,071;I'm not a bleeding poet.

37;00:06:13,106;00:06:14,990;No, you're really not.

38;00:06:15,024;00:06:16,908;What did I get for it?

39;00:06:16,943;00:06:19,861;An arrow six inches

39;00:06:16,943;00:06:19,861;from my heart.

40;00:06:21,364;00:06:23,982;There'll be arrows for all

40;00:06:21,364;00:06:23,982;of us soon, I imagine.

41;00:06:24,000;00:06:25,617;There will.

42;00:06:25,651;00:06:28,954;They've already done the worst

42;00:06:25,651;00:06:28,954;thing to me they could ever do.

43;00:06:31,791;00:06:33,825;Go get some sleep, Sam.

44;00:06:33,843;00:06:36,094;I'll take this watch.

45;00:07:18,704;00:07:21,723;Did I ever

45;00:07:18,704;00:07:21,723;tell you about her?

46;00:07:21,757;00:07:24,843;My Sheila?

46;00:07:21,757;00:07:24,843;Yes.

47;00:07:24,877;00:07:27,212;That was a night

47;00:07:24,877;00:07:27,212;to remember.

48;00:07:27,230;00:07:30,682;Of course, I'd had

48;00:07:27,230;00:07:30,682;a good bit to drink.

49;00:07:32,435;00:07:33,902;Her fangs were sharp,

50;00:07:33,936;00:07:36,154;but she knew

50;00:07:33,936;00:07:36,154;how to use them.

51;00:07:36,189;00:07:39,941;And she was nice

51;00:07:36,189;00:07:39,941;and soft down below.

52;00:07:39,992;00:07:42,577;No, she was no

52;00:07:39,992;00:07:42,577;ordinary beast.

53;00:07:42,612;00:07:44,496;Many is the man who--

54;00:07:44,530;00:07:46,615;I know you never

54;00:07:44,530;00:07:46,615;fucked a bear.

55;00:07:46,666;00:07:49,417;You know you never

55;00:07:46,666;00:07:49,417;fucked a bear.

56;00:07:49,452;00:07:52,737;Right now I don't want to think

56;00:07:49,452;00:07:52,737;about the bear you never fucked.

57;00:07:52,755;00:07:55,874;Right now all I want

57;00:07:52,755;00:07:55,874;to think about

58;00:07:55,908;00:07:58,677;is each one of these arrows finding

58;00:07:55,908;00:07:58,677;its way into a crow's heart.

59;00:08:00,213;00:08:02,264;We could be waiting

59;00:08:00,213;00:08:02,264;here a while.

60;00:08:02,298;00:08:03,632;Good.

61;00:08:03,683;00:08:05,684;The longer we wait,

61;00:08:03,683;00:08:05,684;the more arrows I'll have.

62;00:08:10,089;00:08:13,275;They came up here

62;00:08:10,089;00:08:13,275;to our land

63;00:08:13,309;00:08:15,861;and put up a big wall

63;00:08:13,309;00:08:15,861;and said it was theirs.

64;00:08:15,895;00:08:18,280;Then they started

64;00:08:15,895;00:08:18,280;hunting us down.

65;00:08:20,066;00:08:23,618;This time, we're the ones

65;00:08:20,066;00:08:23,618;doing the hunting.

66;00:08:25,321;00:08:28,123;You've got a lot

66;00:08:25,321;00:08:28,123;to say about killing.

67;00:08:28,157;00:08:30,242;Even more words

67;00:08:28,157;00:08:30,242;than arrows.

68;00:08:31,944;00:08:34,779;Back in those villages, I killed

68;00:08:31,944;00:08:34,779;just as many of them as you did.

69;00:08:34,797;00:08:36,798;More, I reckon.

70;00:08:36,832;00:08:40,919;Yes, but none of those

70;00:08:36,832;00:08:40,919;were your crow lover.

71;00:08:40,953;00:08:42,721;I probably killed

71;00:08:40,953;00:08:42,721;him already.

72;00:08:42,755;00:08:44,172;So you've said.

73;00:08:44,223;00:08:46,391;And if not,

74;00:08:46,425;00:08:50,095;the only thing left of him is gonna be

74;00:08:46,425;00:08:50,095;his fun bits hanging around my neck.

75;00:08:50,129;00:08:51,963;More words.

76;00:08:51,981;00:08:54,316;Know what I think

76;00:08:51,981;00:08:54,316;you do when you see him?

77;00:08:54,350;00:08:58,186;Serve him up a nice juicy

77;00:08:54,350;00:08:58,186;slice of ginger minge.

78;00:09:01,190;00:09:04,576;You been thinking

78;00:09:01,190;00:09:04,576;about that ginger minge?

79;00:09:06,112;00:09:08,446;Wondering what

79;00:09:06,112;00:09:08,446;it tastes like?

80;00:09:10,833;00:09:13,418;Maybe I have.

81;00:09:13,452;00:09:15,954;Jon Snow is mine.

82;00:09:17,790;00:09:19,874;Anyone else

82;00:09:17,790;00:09:19,874;tries to kill him,

83;00:09:19,926;00:09:22,677;I'll have

83;00:09:19,926;00:09:22,677;an arrow for them.

84;00:09:25,131;00:09:29,134;And not one of your bald friends

84;00:09:25,131;00:09:29,134;is fast enough to stop me.

85;00:09:50,239;00:09:55,126;And what is it that couldn't

85;00:09:50,239;00:09:55,126;wait until morning, Tarly?

86;00:09:55,161;00:09:57,295;Maester Aemon.

87;00:09:57,330;00:09:59,864;How did you know--

87;00:09:57,330;00:09:59,864;That it was you?

88;00:09:59,882;00:10:02,467;Who else

88;00:09:59,882;00:10:02,467;but Samwell Tarly

89;00:10:02,501;00:10:04,386;would be wasting candles

90;00:10:04,420;00:10:07,055;to read in the middle

90;00:10:04,420;00:10:07,055;of the night?

91;00:10:10,643;00:10:13,178;Let me help you.

91;00:10:10,643;00:10:13,178;Oh, no need.

92;00:10:14,480;00:10:16,564;I know my way

92;00:10:14,480;00:10:16,564;around this library

93;00:10:16,599;00:10:19,184;better than any other

93;00:10:16,599;00:10:19,184;place in Castle Black.

94;00:10:19,218;00:10:21,519;Thousands of books

95;00:10:21,553;00:10:23,855;and no eyes to read them.

96;00:10:23,889;00:10:27,909;Old age is a wonderful

96;00:10:23,889;00:10:27,909;source of ironies

97;00:10:27,943;00:10:30,111;if nothing else.

98;00:10:30,162;00:10:32,664;But you didn't

98;00:10:30,162;00:10:32,664;answer my question.

99;00:10:32,698;00:10:34,282;What are you reading?

100;00:10:34,333;00:10:36,701;Maester Faull.

101;00:10:36,735;00:10:39,704;Ah, the wildlings.

102;00:10:39,738;00:10:43,291;I can assure you that

102;00:10:39,738;00:10:43,291;the closest Maester Faull

103;00:10:43,342;00:10:46,711;ever got to a wildling

103;00:10:43,342;00:10:46,711;was this very library.

104;00:10:46,745;00:10:49,681;But what he says

104;00:10:46,745;00:10:49,681;about what they do,

105;00:10:49,715;00:10:51,182;it's all true.

106;00:10:51,217;00:10:54,919;It's exactly what the survivors

106;00:10:51,217;00:10:54,919;of their raids report.

107;00:10:54,937;00:10:59,774;Yes, imagine the stories

107;00:10:54,937;00:10:59,774;wildlings tell about us.

108;00:11:01,310;00:11:04,229;Love is the death

108;00:11:01,310;00:11:04,229;of duty.

109;00:11:05,481;00:11:07,982;I told that to your friend

109;00:11:05,481;00:11:07,982;Jon Snow once.

110;00:11:08,034;00:11:12,270;He didn't listen

110;00:11:08,034;00:11:12,270;and neither did you.

111;00:11:12,288;00:11:16,274;Which is why you've abandoned

111;00:11:12,288;00:11:16,274;your watch atop the Wall

112;00:11:16,292;00:11:20,245;to come here and read

112;00:11:16,292;00:11:20,245;about the terrible things

113;00:11:20,279;00:11:24,416;that may have happened

113;00:11:20,279;00:11:24,416;to the girl you love.

114;00:11:24,450;00:11:27,452;I don't love her.

115;00:11:27,470;00:11:29,421;Yes, you do.

115;00:11:27,470;00:11:29,421;No.

116;00:11:29,455;00:11:31,139;Yes, you do.

117;00:11:31,173;00:11:35,343;Heard it in your voice when

117;00:11:31,173;00:11:35,343;you first brought her to me.

118;00:11:35,394;00:11:37,595;I remember how it sounds.

119;00:11:37,646;00:11:39,630;I was in love once.

120;00:11:39,648;00:11:40,932;You were?

121;00:11:40,966;00:11:45,270;You can imagine

121;00:11:40,966;00:11:45,270;all manner of horrors

122;00:11:45,304;00:11:47,972;befalling that poor

122;00:11:45,304;00:11:47,972;girl and her child.

123;00:11:47,990;00:11:50,742;Is it so difficult

123;00:11:47,990;00:11:50,742;to imagine

124;00:11:50,776;00:11:52,660;that an old person

124;00:11:50,776;00:11:52,660;was once,

125;00:11:52,695;00:11:54,863;more or less,

125;00:11:52,695;00:11:54,863;like you?

126;00:11:54,914;00:11:57,532;I'm sorry, Maester.

127;00:11:57,583;00:11:59,317;I didn't mean it

127;00:11:57,583;00:11:59,317;like that.

128;00:11:59,335;00:12:03,221;Do you know who I was

128;00:11:59,335;00:12:03,221;before I came here?

129;00:12:03,255;00:12:07,292;What I could have been

129;00:12:03,255;00:12:07,292;if I'd only said the word?

130;00:12:08,827;00:12:10,628;Of course you do.

131;00:12:10,663;00:12:14,382;I met many girls

131;00:12:10,663;00:12:14,382;when I was Aemon Targaryen.

132;00:12:14,433;00:12:18,303;A future king

132;00:12:14,433;00:12:18,303;always does.

133;00:12:19,338;00:12:21,940;Some of them

133;00:12:19,338;00:12:21,940;were quite forward

134;00:12:21,974;00:12:24,642;in their attempts

134;00:12:21,974;00:12:24,642;to win my affections.

135;00:12:25,844;00:12:28,113;One of them succeeded.

136;00:12:29,115;00:12:31,032;I was very young.

137;00:12:31,066;00:12:33,685;Who was she?

138;00:12:33,719;00:12:35,653;Ah.

139;00:12:35,687;00:12:38,239;I could tell you

139;00:12:35,687;00:12:38,239;everything about her.

140;00:12:38,290;00:12:40,158;Who she was,

141;00:12:40,192;00:12:41,960;how we met,

142;00:12:41,994;00:12:44,129;the color of her eyes,

143;00:12:44,163;00:12:46,898;and the shape

143;00:12:44,163;00:12:46,898;of her nose.

144;00:12:48,801;00:12:50,969;I can see her

145;00:12:51,003;00:12:53,838;right in front of me.

146;00:12:55,691;00:12:59,260;She's more real

146;00:12:55,691;00:12:59,260;than you are.

147;00:13:02,381;00:13:06,717;We could spend all night

147;00:13:02,381;00:13:06,717;trading tales of lost loves.

148;00:13:06,735;00:13:09,554;Nothing makes the past

148;00:13:06,735;00:13:09,554;a sweeter place to visit

149;00:13:09,572;00:13:12,724;than the prospect

149;00:13:09,572;00:13:12,724;of imminent death.

150;00:13:12,758;00:13:15,076;Go to bed, Tarly.

151;00:13:21,083;00:13:23,668;Sorry, I can't open the gate

151;00:13:21,083;00:13:23,668;for anybody. Orders.

152;00:13:23,702;00:13:25,954;- You don't understand.

152;00:13:23,702;00:13:25,954;- They killed everyone.

153;00:13:26,005;00:13:28,072;Everyone but me

153;00:13:26,005;00:13:28,072;and my baby.

154;00:13:28,090;00:13:30,458;They're out there.

154;00:13:28,090;00:13:30,458;I saw them on my way here.

155;00:13:30,509;00:13:32,710;They may have seen me. They

155;00:13:30,509;00:13:32,710;may have followed me. Please.

156;00:13:32,761;00:13:34,179;I'm sorry, I can't.

157;00:13:34,213;00:13:35,580;If they find us out here,

157;00:13:34,213;00:13:35,580;you don't know...

158;00:13:35,598;00:13:37,415;Pyp!

158;00:13:35,598;00:13:37,415;Open the gate.

159;00:13:37,433;00:13:40,134;I can't.

159;00:13:37,433;00:13:40,134;Sam, is that you?

160;00:13:40,186;00:13:42,303;Yes.

161;00:13:42,354;00:13:44,389;Thorne gave me strict

161;00:13:42,354;00:13:44,389;orders to not open the gate.

162;00:13:44,423;00:13:47,025;Oh, Pyp,

162;00:13:44,423;00:13:47,025;open the fucking gate!

163;00:13:48,477;00:13:50,094;I never heard you

163;00:13:48,477;00:13:50,094;curse before.

164;00:13:50,112;00:13:52,197;Yes, well,

164;00:13:50,112;00:13:52,197;best get used to it.

165;00:13:58,237;00:14:00,121;Are you all right?

166;00:14:02,107;00:14:04,659;Shh, you're all right.

167;00:14:04,710;00:14:08,613;Of course you are,

167;00:14:04,710;00:14:08,613;my brave little fella.

168;00:14:08,631;00:14:11,299;It was horrible.

168;00:14:08,631;00:14:11,299;I'm so, so sorry.

169;00:14:11,333;00:14:13,134;I didn't know

169;00:14:11,333;00:14:13,134;until I got back.

170;00:14:13,168;00:14:14,636;Don't let them

170;00:14:13,168;00:14:14,636;send me away, Sam.

171;00:14:14,670;00:14:16,554;Never. - I know there's

171;00:14:14,670;00:14:16,554;no women allowed.

172;00:14:16,589;00:14:20,058;Anyone who tries to throw you out

172;00:14:16,589;00:14:20,058;will be having words with me.

173;00:14:20,092;00:14:23,094;From now on,

173;00:14:20,092;00:14:23,094;wherever you go,

174;00:14:23,128;00:14:25,597;I go, too.

175;00:14:35,691;00:14:37,525;Get ready!

176;00:14:37,576;00:14:39,744;Man the gate!

176;00:14:37,576;00:14:39,744;Ready yourselves!

177;00:14:39,778;00:14:41,829;Make haste!

178;00:14:41,864;00:14:43,981;Prepare!

178;00:14:41,864;00:14:43,981;Up on the Wall!

179;00:14:43,999;00:14:45,533;Quickly!

179;00:14:43,999;00:14:45,533;Up! Up!

180;00:14:45,584;00:14:48,786;How many?

180;00:14:45,584;00:14:48,786;- How many are there?

181;00:14:51,123;00:14:52,957;Beyond the trees!

182;00:14:56,828;00:14:58,930;It's time.

183;00:15:46,178;00:15:48,596;Light them up!

183;00:15:46,178;00:15:48,596;Light them all!

184;00:15:58,240;00:16:00,024;Move!

185;00:16:02,695;00:16:04,028;Pick up the pace!

186;00:16:04,062;00:16:06,080;Come on, come on.

187;00:16:12,755;00:16:15,340;Here we go, boys,

187;00:16:12,755;00:16:15,340;there's one.

188;00:16:15,374;00:16:18,543;Let's go.

188;00:16:15,374;00:16:18,543;There's two.

189;00:16:21,630;00:16:23,631;Let's get the next load.

190;00:16:26,552;00:16:29,053;That's the last

190;00:16:26,552;00:16:29,053;of the oil, Ser Alliser.

191;00:16:30,389;00:16:33,191;100,000 you say?

192;00:16:33,225;00:16:35,393;Yes, Ser.

193;00:16:35,427;00:16:37,729;You can say it

193;00:16:35,427;00:16:37,729;if you like.

194;00:16:37,763;00:16:41,616;We should have sealed the

194;00:16:37,763;00:16:41,616;tunnel while we had the chance,

195;00:16:41,650;00:16:45,036;like you suggested.

196;00:16:45,070;00:16:48,289;It was a difficult

196;00:16:45,070;00:16:48,289;decision either way, Ser.

197;00:16:50,459;00:16:54,111;Do you know what leadership

197;00:16:50,459;00:16:54,111;means, Lord Snow?

198;00:16:54,129;00:16:57,215;It means that the person in

198;00:16:54,129;00:16:57,215;charge gets second-guessed

199;00:16:57,249;00:16:59,834;by every clever little

199;00:16:57,249;00:16:59,834;twat with a mouth.

200;00:16:59,885;00:17:02,286;But if he starts

200;00:16:59,885;00:17:02,286;second-guessing himself,

201;00:17:02,304;00:17:04,121;that's the end--

202;00:17:04,139;00:17:07,592;for him, for the

202;00:17:04,139;00:17:07,592;clever little twats,

203;00:17:07,626;00:17:09,310;for everyone.

204;00:17:09,344;00:17:12,313;This is not the end.

204;00:17:09,344;00:17:12,313;Not for us.

205;00:17:12,347;00:17:14,482;Not if you lot

205;00:17:12,347;00:17:14,482;do your duty

206;00:17:14,516;00:17:17,068;for however long it takes

206;00:17:14,516;00:17:17,068;to beat them back.

207;00:17:18,520;00:17:21,773;And then you get

207;00:17:18,520;00:17:21,773;to go on hating me

208;00:17:21,807;00:17:23,441;and I get

208;00:17:21,807;00:17:23,441;to go on wishing

209;00:17:23,475;00:17:25,943;your wildling whore

209;00:17:23,475;00:17:25,943;had finished the job.

210;00:17:49,167;00:17:50,768;You'll be safe

210;00:17:49,167;00:17:50,768;down here.

211;00:17:50,803;00:17:52,687;I'll check on you

211;00:17:50,803;00:17:52,687;as soon as I can.

212;00:17:52,721;00:17:55,640;You're leaving me again?

213;00:17:56,725;00:17:58,359;I'm not leaving you.

214;00:17:58,393;00:18:01,178;You're going up there and we're

214;00:17:58,393;00:18:01,178;staying down here. That's leaving.

215;00:18:01,196;00:18:03,564;You said from now on

215;00:18:01,196;00:18:03,564;we'd stay together.

216;00:18:03,615;00:18:06,617;I didn't mean

216;00:18:03,615;00:18:06,617;in the same room.

217;00:18:06,652;00:18:07,985;What are you going

217;00:18:06,652;00:18:07,985;to do out there?

218;00:18:08,019;00:18:09,370;Help my brothers.

218;00:18:08,019;00:18:09,370;How?

219;00:18:10,856;00:18:13,040;You're going to fight the

219;00:18:10,856;00:18:13,040;free folk when they come?

220;00:18:13,075;00:18:15,910;They'll kill you. In Mole's

220;00:18:13,075;00:18:15,910;Town, they killed everyone.

221;00:18:15,961;00:18:19,547;I can't just hide here with you

221;00:18:15,961;00:18:19,547;while they're fighting out there.

222;00:18:19,581;00:18:22,416;Why not? You won't

222;00:18:19,581;00:18:22,416;matter up there.

223;00:18:22,468;00:18:24,085;You will down here.

224;00:18:25,370;00:18:28,372;I am a man of

224;00:18:25,370;00:18:28,372;the Night's Watch, Gilly.

225;00:18:28,390;00:18:30,675;I made a promise

225;00:18:28,390;00:18:30,675;to defend the Wall

226;00:18:30,709;00:18:32,543;and I have to keep it

227;00:18:32,561;00:18:35,146;because that's

227;00:18:32,561;00:18:35,146;what men do.

228;00:18:47,326;00:18:50,027;Promise me

228;00:18:47,326;00:18:50,027;you won't die.

229;00:18:52,664;00:18:56,200;I promise you

229;00:18:52,664;00:18:56,200;I won't die.

230;00:19:30,118;00:19:33,437;There's a lot more wildlings on the

230;00:19:30,118;00:19:33,437;other side of the Wall than this side.

231;00:19:33,455;00:19:36,574;We've got loads

231;00:19:33,455;00:19:36,574;of weapons and things.

232;00:19:36,608;00:19:38,492;It's the perfect place

232;00:19:36,608;00:19:38,492;for us to be.

233;00:19:38,544;00:19:40,745;I've never thrown

233;00:19:38,544;00:19:40,745;a spear before.

234;00:19:40,779;00:19:43,631;I've never held a sword

234;00:19:40,779;00:19:43,631;with a proper edge.

235;00:19:43,665;00:19:46,334;This is no place

235;00:19:43,665;00:19:46,334;for me to be.

236;00:19:48,286;00:19:49,720;You're not afraid?

237;00:19:49,755;00:19:52,223;Of course I'm afraid.

238;00:19:52,257;00:19:54,759;There's a band of wildlings

238;00:19:52,257;00:19:54,759;coming to kill us.

239;00:19:54,793;00:19:56,227;If you're afraid

239;00:19:54,793;00:19:56,227;of a band of wildlings,

240;00:19:56,261;00:19:59,513;how in seven hells did you

240;00:19:56,261;00:19:59,513;manage to kill a white walker?

241;00:20:04,987;00:20:07,655;I didn't know

241;00:20:04,987;00:20:07,655;I was going to kill it.

242;00:20:07,689;00:20:10,441;But I had to do something.

242;00:20:07,689;00:20:10,441;I didn't have any choice.

243;00:20:10,475;00:20:12,443;It was going to kill Gilly

243;00:20:10,475;00:20:12,443;and take the baby.

244;00:20:14,479;00:20:17,748;If someone had asked

244;00:20:14,479;00:20:17,748;me my name right then,

245;00:20:17,783;00:20:19,450;I wouldn't have known.

246;00:20:21,203;00:20:24,171;I wasn't

246;00:20:21,203;00:20:24,171;Samwell Tarly anymore.

247;00:20:24,206;00:20:26,958;I wasn't a steward

247;00:20:24,206;00:20:26,958;in the Night's Watch

248;00:20:26,992;00:20:29,710;or son of Randyll Tarly

248;00:20:26,992;00:20:29,710;or any of that.

249;00:20:30,963;00:20:33,047;I was nothing at all.

250;00:20:34,933;00:20:36,884;And when you're

250;00:20:34,933;00:20:36,884;nothing at all,

251;00:20:36,935;00:20:39,553;there's no more reason

251;00:20:36,935;00:20:39,553;to be afraid.

252;00:20:41,356;00:20:43,357;But you're afraid now?

253;00:20:44,226;00:20:45,860;Yes, well...

254;00:20:47,729;00:20:49,814;I'm not nothing anymore.

255;00:21:09,084;00:21:10,501;Most of their men

255;00:21:09,084;00:21:10,501;are up top.

256;00:21:10,535;00:21:13,871;Didn't count more than 20 down here.

256;00:21:10,535;00:21:13,871;Leftovers.

257;00:21:13,889;00:21:15,973;They got a big fat one and a

257;00:21:13,889;00:21:15,973;little bony one manning the front.

258;00:21:16,008;00:21:17,508;How high are the walls?

259;00:21:17,542;00:21:19,810;Well, we'll be up and over before

274;00:24:02,891;00:24:04,725;They're attacking

274;00:24:02,891;00:24:04,725;the southern gate!

275;00:24:04,759;00:24:06,894;- Now?

275;00:24:04,759;00:24:06,894;Now.

276;00:24:10,232;00:24:13,984;I'm going down there. Brother

276;00:24:10,232;00:24:13,984;Slynt, you have the Wall.

277;00:24:14,019;00:24:16,553;What?

278;00:24:16,571;00:24:19,773;What are you fucking waiting for?

278;00:24:16,571;00:24:19,773;Loose!

279;00:24:19,825;00:24:23,277;You heard the man.

279;00:24:19,825;00:24:23,277;Loose!

280;00:25:00,448;00:25:01,982;You, over there.

281;00:25:06,905;00:25:09,039;Did you get one?

281;00:25:06,905;00:25:09,039;No.

282;00:25:10,542;00:25:12,710;Ah, shit, Pyp!

282;00:25:10,542;00:25:12,710;Shit.

283;00:25:12,744;00:25:14,378;Sam.

283;00:25:12,744;00:25:14,378;Yeah?

284;00:25:14,412;00:25:16,213;I think

284;00:25:14,412;00:25:16,213;we're gonna die.

285;00:25:16,248;00:25:18,249;If you keep

285;00:25:16,248;00:25:18,249;missing, we will.

286;00:25:28,126;00:25:30,227;Come on!

286;00:25:28,126;00:25:30,227;Come on!

287;00:25:34,900;00:25:36,600;Brothers!

288;00:25:36,634;00:25:40,187;100 generations

288;00:25:36,634;00:25:40,187;have defended this castle.

289;00:25:40,238;00:25:42,990;She's never fallen before.

290;00:25:43,024;00:25:44,474;She will not fall tonight.

291;00:25:44,492;00:25:47,644;Those are Thenns

291;00:25:44,492;00:25:47,644;at our walls.

292;00:25:47,662;00:25:49,980;They eat the flesh

292;00:25:47,662;00:25:49,980;of the men they kill.

293;00:25:49,998;00:25:53,167;Do you want to fill

293;00:25:49,998;00:25:53,167;the belly of a Thenn tonight?

294;00:25:53,201;00:25:54,501;No!

295;00:25:54,536;00:25:56,036;Tonight we fight.

296;00:25:56,087;00:25:58,488;And when the sun rises,

296;00:25:56,087;00:25:58,488;I promise you,

297;00:25:58,506;00:26:00,424;Castle Black will stand!

298;00:26:01,543;00:26:03,761;The Night's Watch

298;00:26:01,543;00:26:03,761;will stand.

299;00:26:07,132;00:26:10,601;With me now!

299;00:26:07,132;00:26:10,601;Now with me!

300;00:27:06,658;00:27:09,276;No discipline.

300;00:27:06,658;00:27:09,276;No training.

301;00:27:09,327;00:27:12,112;Gang of thieves,

301;00:27:09,327;00:27:12,112;that's all this is.

302;00:27:12,163;00:27:14,915;I commanded the City Watch

302;00:27:12,163;00:27:14,915;of King's Landing.

303;00:27:14,949;00:27:16,834;Those men obeyed orders.

304;00:27:16,868;00:27:18,669;We can't just let

304;00:27:16,868;00:27:18,669;them attack the gate!

305;00:27:18,703;00:27:22,039;The bars of those gates are four

305;00:27:18,703;00:27:22,039;inches of cold-rolled steel.

306;00:27:22,073;00:27:24,541;Those are giants riding

306;00:27:22,073;00:27:24,541;mammoths down there!

307;00:27:24,575;00:27:27,044;Do you think your cold-rolled

307;00:27:24,575;00:27:27,044;steel is gonna stop them?

308;00:27:27,078;00:27:28,345;No such thing

308;00:27:27,078;00:27:28,345;as giants.

309;00:27:28,380;00:27:31,048;A story

309;00:27:28,380;00:27:31,048;for the children.

310;00:27:32,967;00:27:34,852;Brother Slynt.

311;00:27:34,886;00:27:37,688;We just got word that Ser

311;00:27:34,886;00:27:37,688;Alliser needs you below.

312;00:27:39,557;00:27:42,726;You're the most experienced man

312;00:27:39,557;00:27:42,726;he's got, Ser, and he needs you.

313;00:27:43,645;00:27:45,429;Needed below?

314;00:27:45,447;00:27:47,614;Yes. Yes.

315;00:27:56,791;00:28:00,294;Archers, nock your arrows!

316;00:28:00,328;00:28:02,830;Nock arrows!

317;00:28:02,881;00:28:04,581;Draw!

318;00:28:06,051;00:28:08,218;Loose!

319;00:28:22,100;00:28:24,301;They won't summit

319;00:28:22,100;00:28:24,301;before dawn.

320;00:28:24,319;00:28:25,352;How do you know that?

321;00:28:25,403;00:28:27,471;Because I've made

321;00:28:25,403;00:28:27,471;that climb.

322;00:28:27,489;00:28:30,607;I think they're in a bigger

322;00:28:27,489;00:28:30,607;hurry than you were.

323;00:28:33,328;00:28:35,195;Hold the bridge!

324;00:28:35,246;00:28:37,364;Hold, wait for it!

325;00:28:37,415;00:28:40,250;Come on with the rocks!

326;00:28:45,874;00:28:47,341;Nock!

327;00:28:49,260;00:28:50,711;Draw!

328;00:28:54,382;00:28:55,682;Loose!

329;00:29:14,652;00:29:16,653;Down!

330;00:29:50,772;00:29:53,273;No! No!

331;00:30:12,293;00:30:13,877;To the gate.

331;00:30:12,293;00:30:13,877;Come on, let's move.

332;00:30:17,932;00:30:19,216;It's gonna open.

333;00:31:23,998;00:31:26,366;I got one right through the heart.

333;00:31:23,998;00:31:26,366;He's dead.

334;00:31:26,417;00:31:28,818;Oh, is it over?

334;00:31:26,417;00:31:28,818;No.

335;00:31:28,836;00:31:30,704;Well, then...

336;00:31:38,212;00:31:41,298;You're all right.

336;00:31:38,212;00:31:41,298;You're all right.

337;00:31:43,601;00:31:45,769;I'll get help.

338;00:31:45,803;00:31:47,521;Shh. Shh.

339;00:31:47,555;00:31:49,856;Maester Aemon is coming.

340;00:31:49,891;00:31:51,841;He's gonna make

340;00:31:49,891;00:31:51,841;it all right.

341;00:31:51,859;00:31:55,145;Shh. Shh.

342;00:32:03,321;00:32:05,956;Now.

342;00:32:03,321;00:32:05,956;Now!

343;00:33:39,000;00:33:40,751;The outer gate

343;00:33:39,000;00:33:40,751;won't hold.

344;00:33:40,785;00:33:43,720;Take five men,

344;00:33:40,785;00:33:43,720;hold the inner gate.

345;00:33:43,755;00:33:45,138;Aye.

346;00:33:47,642;00:33:49,476;Hold the gate.

347;00:33:49,510;00:33:51,812;If they make it through...

348;00:33:54,098;00:33:55,982;They won't.

349;00:33:58,019;00:34:00,687;Come on, Hill.

349;00:33:58,019;00:34:00,687;And you, Cooper.

350;00:34:00,738;00:34:03,907;You three, on me.

351;00:34:03,941;00:34:06,243;Come on,

351;00:34:03,941;00:34:06,243;you lazy bastards.

352;00:34:10,114;00:34:12,115;Oil.

353;00:34:13,117;00:34:15,252;Oil on the ramp!

354;00:34:24,378;00:34:26,630;Protect the gate!

355;00:34:59,697;00:35:01,548;Get him inside.

356;00:35:05,670;00:35:07,754;Hold the fucking gate!

357;00:35:07,805;00:35:09,923;Hold it!

358;00:36:08,432;00:36:09,933;We need more men

358;00:36:08,432;00:36:09,933;down here.

359;00:36:09,952;00:36:12,452;We have to hold the gate.

359;00:36:09,952;00:36:12,452;But we need men here.

360;00:36:12,486;00:36:14,771;Tell Jon.

360;00:36:12,486;00:36:14,771;He's in command.

361;00:36:14,789;00:36:17,207;Let's go.

362;00:36:24,832;00:36:28,001;Get me to the top!

362;00:36:24,832;00:36:28,001;You hear me?!

363;00:36:32,506;00:36:34,925;Your name's Olly, right?

364;00:36:34,959;00:36:38,178;Listen to me, Olly.

364;00:36:34,959;00:36:38,178;Get me to the top.

365;00:36:38,229;00:36:41,231;And when we give the signal,

365;00:36:38,229;00:36:41,231;bring us back down.

366;00:36:42,400;00:36:43,984;You hear me?

367;00:36:48,573;00:36:51,241;Find a weapon, Olly.

367;00:36:48,573;00:36:51,241;Fight them.

368;00:37:24,025;00:37:26,176;Clear the way!

368;00:37:24,025;00:37:26,176;Let's go!

369;00:37:26,210;00:37:28,311;Out of the way!

369;00:37:26,210;00:37:28,311;Get out of here!

370;00:37:45,746;00:37:48,197;Cut the rope!

371;00:37:54,338;00:37:56,840;Wait! No!

372;00:38:10,888;00:38:12,906;We need more archers.

372;00:38:10,888;00:38:12,906;Here I am.

373;00:38:12,940;00:38:15,275;Come on.

373;00:38:12,940;00:38:15,275;Quickly.

374;00:38:17,495;00:38:19,412;What are you

374;00:38:17,495;00:38:19,412;doing up here?

375;00:38:19,447;00:38:21,948;The wildlings

375;00:38:19,447;00:38:21,948;are over the walls.

376;00:38:21,999;00:38:23,783;Ser Alliser's fallen.

377;00:38:23,834;00:38:26,503;The castle won't stand

377;00:38:23,834;00:38:26,503;much longer.

378;00:38:28,205;00:38:31,174;Edd, you have the Wall.

379;00:38:33,427;00:38:35,912;If they try the mammoths

379;00:38:33,427;00:38:35,912;again, drop fire on them.

380;00:38:35,930;00:38:38,715;If the climbers get too high,

380;00:38:35,930;00:38:38,715;drop the scythe on them.

381;00:38:44,221;00:38:47,423;Come, brothers.

381;00:38:44,221;00:38:47,423;Now fight with me!

382;00:38:47,441;00:38:51,277;Might as well enjoy

382;00:38:47,441;00:38:51,277;our last night, right, boys?

383;00:38:51,362;00:38:53,279;Light the fuckers up!

384;00:38:53,314;00:38:56,483;Nock! Draw!

385;00:38:57,434;00:38:59,652;Loose!

386;00:39:08,278;00:39:09,412;How are we

386;00:39:08,278;00:39:09,412;gonna stop that?

387;00:39:09,446;00:39:10,747;Shot 20 arrows

387;00:39:09,446;00:39:10,747;in him already.

388;00:39:10,781;00:39:12,215;You heard Jon.

388;00:39:10,781;00:39:12,215;We hold the gate.

389;00:39:12,249;00:39:13,666;Jon Snow's not

389;00:39:12,249;00:39:13,666;Lord Commander.

390;00:39:13,718;00:39:15,385;We hold the gate!

391;00:39:24,261;00:39:26,763;Mother, save me.

391;00:39:24,261;00:39:26,763;Father, save me.

392;00:39:26,797;00:39:27,981;The gods aren't down here.

393;00:39:28,015;00:39:29,649;It's the six of us.

393;00:39:28,015;00:39:29,649;You hear me?

394;00:39:35,606;00:39:38,307;Night gathers

394;00:39:35,606;00:39:38,307;and now my watch begins.

395;00:39:38,325;00:39:40,744;It shall not end

395;00:39:38,325;00:39:40,744;until my death.

396;00:39:40,778;00:39:43,246;I shall take no wife,

396;00:39:40,778;00:39:43,246;hold no lands,

397;00:39:43,280;00:39:44,864;father no children.

398;00:39:44,915;00:39:47,450;I shall wear no crown

398;00:39:44,915;00:39:47,450;and win no glory.

399;00:39:47,484;00:39:49,669;I shall live and die

399;00:39:47,484;00:39:49,669;at my post.

400;00:39:49,703;00:39:51,588;I am the sword

400;00:39:49,703;00:39:51,588;in the darkness.

401;00:39:51,622;00:39:53,423;I am the watcher

401;00:39:51,622;00:39:53,423;on the walls.

402;00:39:53,457;00:39:56,459;I am the shield that guards

402;00:39:53,457;00:39:56,459;the realms of men.

403;00:39:56,493;00:40:00,513;I pledge my life and honor

403;00:39:56,493;00:40:00,513;to the Night's Watch

404;00:40:00,548;00:40:03,216;for this night

404;00:40:00,548;00:40:03,216;and all the nights to come!

405;00:40:09,006;00:40:10,440;I don't want you

405;00:40:09,006;00:40:10,440;out there.

406;00:40:10,474;00:40:12,692;You can't

406;00:40:10,474;00:40:12,692;protect me forever.

407;00:40:12,726;00:40:15,311;There won't be anywhere

407;00:40:12,726;00:40:15,311;to hide if the castle falls.

408;00:40:18,149;00:40:20,700;I need him

408;00:40:18,149;00:40:20,700;more than I need you.

409;00:41:34,191;00:41:36,726;We need you, boy.

410;00:41:58,832;00:42:00,550;Ha!

411;00:43:55,616;00:43:57,166;Jon Snow.

412;00:43:57,201;00:44:00,453;Hush.

412;00:43:57,201;00:44:00,453;Don't talk.

413;00:44:04,574;00:44:07,043;Do you remember the cave?

414;00:44:11,465;00:44:14,267;We should have

414;00:44:11,465;00:44:14,267;stayed in the cave.

415;00:44:18,255;00:44:20,223;We'll go back there.

416;00:44:26,313;00:44:29,649;You know nothing,

416;00:44:26,313;00:44:29,649;Jon Snow.

417;00:45:04,902;00:45:07,320;Drop the scythe, boys!

418;00:45:29,493;00:45:31,994;Hoist her up.

418;00:45:29,493;00:45:31,994;- Hoist her up!

419;00:45:37,885;00:45:40,002;They've had enough

419;00:45:37,885;00:45:40,002;for one night.

420;00:45:44,141;00:45:46,476;Don't cheer too loud.

421;00:45:47,861;00:45:50,897;They still outnumber us

421;00:45:47,861;00:45:50,897;1,000 to one.

422;00:45:59,206;00:46:00,957;Tormund.

423;00:46:00,991;00:46:03,543;It's over.

424;00:46:03,577;00:46:04,911;Let it end.

425;00:46:04,962;00:46:07,246;This is how a man ends.

426;00:46:15,222;00:46:16,756;Put him in chains.

427;00:46:17,874;00:46:19,675;We'll question him later.

428;00:46:22,396;00:46:24,814;I should have

428;00:46:22,396;00:46:24,814;thrown you

429;00:46:24,848;00:46:27,850;from the top

429;00:46:24,848;00:46:27,850;of the Wall, boy!

430;00:46:27,884;00:46:29,902;Aye.

431;00:46:29,937;00:46:31,988;You should have.

432;00:46:39,112;00:46:41,781;Whoa, it's me.

432;00:46:39,112;00:46:41,781;It's me.

433;00:46:45,619;00:46:47,453;I promised you,

433;00:46:45,619;00:46:47,453;didn't I?

434;00:47:02,436;00:47:04,136;We held them off.

435;00:47:04,188;00:47:06,138;For one night.

436;00:47:06,190;00:47:08,524;This is a great

436;00:47:06,190;00:47:08,524;victory.

437;00:47:08,559;00:47:10,726;A great victory?

438;00:47:12,279;00:47:14,530;Mance was testing

438;00:47:12,279;00:47:14,530;our defenses.

439;00:47:14,565;00:47:16,148;He almost

439;00:47:14,565;00:47:16,148;made it through.

440;00:47:16,200;00:47:18,985;And he has more giants.

440;00:47:16,200;00:47:18,985;He has more mammoths.

441;00:47:19,036;00:47:21,737;He has 1,000 times

441;00:47:19,036;00:47:21,737;as many men.

442;00:47:25,108;00:47:27,660;They'll hit us

442;00:47:25,108;00:47:27,660;again tonight.

443;00:47:27,711;00:47:30,129;Maybe we can hold them

443;00:47:27,711;00:47:30,129;off for a day or two,

444;00:47:30,163;00:47:31,914;but we'll never

444;00:47:30,163;00:47:31,914;beat them.

445;00:47:33,133;00:47:34,500;Where are we going?

446;00:47:34,551;00:47:36,219;Going to find Mance.

447;00:47:36,253;00:47:38,955;To fi---

447;00:47:36,253;00:47:38,955;you can't do that.

448;00:47:38,989;00:47:40,840;No one gave you

448;00:47:38,989;00:47:40,840;any orders.

449;00:47:42,593;00:47:44,977;Who's left

449;00:47:42,593;00:47:44,977;to give orders?

450;00:47:45,012;00:47:47,763;The wildling army's only

450;00:47:45,012;00:47:47,763;an army because of Mance.

451;00:47:47,797;00:47:50,516;He united

451;00:47:47,797;00:47:50,516;100 warring tribes.

452;00:47:50,567;00:47:52,602;Without Mance,

452;00:47:50,567;00:47:52,602;they lose their leader.

453;00:47:52,636;00:47:55,321;They lose their purpose. They

453;00:47:52,636;00:47:55,321;go back to fighting each other.

454;00:47:55,355;00:47:57,156;Scatter back

454;00:47:55,355;00:47:57,156;to their homes.

455;00:47:57,190;00:47:59,358;Without Mance?

456;00:47:59,409;00:48:00,826;You're going to kill him?

457;00:48:00,861;00:48:02,161;I'm gonna try.

458;00:48:02,195;00:48:04,030;They'll never let you

458;00:48:02,195;00:48:04,030;within 100 yards of him.

459;00:48:04,081;00:48:06,282;And even if they did, even

459;00:48:04,081;00:48:06,282;if you managed to kill him--

460;00:48:06,316;00:48:08,868;They'll kill me? If I don't

460;00:48:06,316;00:48:08,868;go, they'll kill me anyway.

461;00:48:08,919;00:48:10,336;They'll kill

461;00:48:08,919;00:48:10,336;the rest of us, too.

462;00:48:10,370;00:48:12,922;They won't just kill you.

463;00:48:12,956;00:48:14,823;They'll boil you.

463;00:48:12,956;00:48:14,823;They'll flay you.

464;00:48:14,841;00:48:16,342;They'll make it last days.

465;00:48:19,162;00:48:22,682;You're right.

465;00:48:19,162;00:48:22,682;It's a bad plan.

466;00:48:24,685;00:48:26,719;What's your plan?

467;00:49:10,013;00:49:12,181;They held the gate.

468;00:49:21,408;00:49:23,993;Get some brothers

468;00:49:21,408;00:49:23,993;down here to help you.

469;00:49:26,113;00:49:28,414;We need to burn

469;00:49:26,113;00:49:28,414;the bodies.

470;00:49:49,252;00:49:52,254;Raise the outer gate.

471;00:49:52,272;00:49:54,807;Then lower it again

471;00:49:52,272;00:49:54,807;as soon as I'm out.

472;00:50:06,236;00:50:07,737;What are you doing?

473;00:50:07,771;00:50:10,456;I promised Mormont

473;00:50:07,771;00:50:10,456;I'd never lose it again.

474;00:50:14,795;00:50:16,962;In case I don't come back.

475;00:50:24,788;00:50:26,806;Jon.

476;00:50:31,478;00:50:33,262;Come back.
