1;00:02:09,755;00:02:12,089;You swear it?
1;00:02:09,755;00:02:12,089;By the mother.
2;00:02:13,383;00:02:16,552;My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.
3;00:02:22,434;00:02:25,228;Then I see no reason for hostility between us.
4;00:02:26,063;00:02:28,731;Your son can go on
4;00:02:26,063;00:02:28,731;calling himself King in the North.
5;00:02:28,816;00:02:32,235;The Starks will have dominion
5;00:02:28,816;00:02:32,235;over all lands north of Moat Cailin,
6;00:02:32,319;00:02:34,195;provided he swears me an oath of fealty.
7;00:02:34,279;00:02:35,363;And the wording of this oath?
8;00:02:35,447;00:02:38,074;The same Ned Stark swore
8;00:02:35,447;00:02:38,074;to Robert 18 years ago.
9;00:02:40,410;00:02:43,871;Cat, their friendship held
9;00:02:40,410;00:02:43,871;the kingdoms together.
10;00:02:48,794;00:02:51,254;And in return for my son's loyalty?
11;00:02:51,630;00:02:54,757;In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army.
12;00:02:55,050;00:02:56,092;When that's done,
13;00:02:56,844;00:03:00,555;Baratheon and Stark will fight
13;00:02:56,844;00:03:00,555;their common enemy together,
14;00:03:00,639;00:03:02,306;as they have done many times before.
15;00:03:08,814;00:03:11,649;Our two houses have always been close,
16;00:03:12,109;00:03:16,028;which is why I am begging you
16;00:03:12,109;00:03:16,028;to reconsider this battle.
17;00:03:16,113;00:03:17,530;Negotiate a peace with your brother.
18;00:03:17,614;00:03:19,782;Negotiate with Stannis?
19;00:03:20,367;00:03:22,076;You heard him out there.
20;00:03:22,160;00:03:25,037;I'd have better luck debating the wind.
21;00:03:26,957;00:03:28,958;Please bring my terms to your son.
22;00:03:29,918;00:03:31,919;I believe we are natural allies.
23;00:03:32,004;00:03:33,337;I hope he feels the same.
24;00:03:33,797;00:03:36,382;Together we could end this war in a fortnight.
25;00:03:51,231;00:03:52,231;No!
26;00:03:56,403;00:03:57,486;No.
27;00:03:57,571;00:03:58,863;Follow me!
28;00:04:01,992;00:04:05,244;You'll die for this.
28;00:04:01,992;00:04:05,244;No, wait, it wasn't her!
29;00:04:49,206;00:04:50,206;We've got to leave.
30;00:04:52,626;00:04:54,669;They'll hang you for this.
31;00:04:56,463;00:04:57,463;Now.
32;00:04:58,256;00:05:00,675;I won't leave him.
33;00:05:02,052;00:05:04,929;You can't avenge him if you're dead.
34;00:05:06,056;00:05:08,349;Over there, go!
35;00:05:08,433;00:05:10,142;Not that way.
36;00:05:44,678;00:05:46,762;We need to go home.
37;00:05:47,597;00:05:49,849;Loras.
37;00:05:47,597;00:05:49,849;My lord, my lady.
38;00:05:49,933;00:05:51,434;Get out.
39;00:05:51,518;00:05:53,602;Stannis will be here in an hour.
40;00:05:53,687;00:05:56,105;When he arrives,
40;00:05:53,687;00:05:56,105;Renly's bannermen will flock to him.
41;00:05:56,815;00:05:58,691;Your former companions
41;00:05:56,815;00:05:58,691;will fight for the privilege
42;00:05:58,775;00:06:01,193;of selling you to their new king.
43;00:06:01,278;00:06:02,945;And you want that privilege for yourself.
44;00:06:03,030;00:06:05,656;You will note that I am standing here
44;00:06:03,030;00:06:05,656;talking to you,
45;00:06:06,408;00:06:07,533;not Stannis.
46;00:06:07,617;00:06:08,868;There's no time for this.
47;00:06:08,952;00:06:10,536;Ride back to Highgarden, sister.
48;00:06:10,620;00:06:12,246;I'm not running from Stannis.
49;00:06:12,330;00:06:13,789;Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
50;00:06:13,874;00:06:14,915;I don't believe that.
51;00:06:15,709;00:06:17,626;You don't believe that.
52;00:06:18,962;00:06:21,297;Who gained the most from our king's death?
53;00:06:21,381;00:06:23,049;Stannis.
54;00:06:23,133;00:06:25,051;I will put a sword through his righteous face.
55;00:06:25,135;00:06:26,886;You can't stay here.
56;00:06:27,679;00:06:29,972;He would have been a true king,
57;00:06:30,849;00:06:32,725;a good king.
58;00:06:32,851;00:06:34,143;Tell me, Ser Loras,
59;00:06:35,145;00:06:36,771;what do you desire most in this world?
60;00:06:37,689;00:06:38,939;Revenge.
61;00:06:39,316;00:06:41,484;I have always found that
61;00:06:39,316;00:06:41,484;to be the purest of motivations,
62;00:06:42,360;00:06:44,904;but you won't have a chance
62;00:06:42,360;00:06:44,904;to put your sword through Stannis,
63;00:06:44,988;00:06:46,739;not today.
64;00:06:46,823;00:06:48,824;You'll be cut to pieces
64;00:06:46,823;00:06:48,824;before he sets foot on solid ground.
65;00:06:48,909;00:06:52,536;If it is justice that you want, be smart about it.
66;00:06:52,704;00:06:55,164;You can't avenge him from the grave.
67;00:06:57,000;00:06:58,918;Bring the horses.
68;00:07:01,379;00:07:02,880;Please.
69;00:07:32,077;00:07:34,036;He was very handsome.
70;00:07:34,412;00:07:35,746;He was, Your Grace.
71;00:07:36,456;00:07:37,915;Your Grace.
72;00:07:40,043;00:07:42,169;Calling yourself king doesn't make you one.
73;00:07:42,254;00:07:45,297;And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen.
74;00:07:46,967;00:07:48,634;Do you want to be a queen?
75;00:07:48,718;00:07:49,927;No.
76;00:07:52,472;00:07:54,557;I want to be the queen.
77;00:08:06,403;00:08:08,654;Killed? By whom?
78;00:08:08,738;00:08:10,156;Accounts differ.
79;00:08:10,240;00:08:12,992;Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark
79;00:08:10,240;00:08:12,992;in some way.
80;00:08:13,076;00:08:14,743;Really? Who'd have thought?
81;00:08:14,828;00:08:17,163;Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard,
82;00:08:17,247;00:08:19,832;while still others say
82;00:08:17,247;00:08:19,832;it was Stannis himself who did it
83;00:08:19,916;00:08:22,084;after negotiations went sour.
84;00:08:22,169;00:08:24,003;Whomever did it, I say well done.
85;00:08:24,087;00:08:25,421;It's not what Varys says.
86;00:08:25,589;00:08:28,132;He says Renly's army
86;00:08:25,589;00:08:28,132;is flocking to support Stannis,
87;00:08:28,633;00:08:31,844;which would give Stannis superiority
87;00:08:28,633;00:08:31,844;over us on both land and sea.
88;00:08:31,970;00:08:34,263;Littlefinger says we can
88;00:08:31,970;00:08:34,263;outspend him three to one.
89;00:08:34,347;00:08:37,391;And I say Father raised you
89;00:08:34,347;00:08:37,391;to have too much respect for money.
90;00:08:37,684;00:08:41,145;Stannis Baratheon is coming for us,
90;00:08:37,684;00:08:41,145;sooner rather than later.
91;00:08:41,229;00:08:42,438;Aren't there other things
91;00:08:41,229;00:08:42,438;you should be doing,
92;00:08:42,522;00:08:44,940;like sealing my daughter in a crate
92;00:08:42,522;00:08:44,940;so you can ship her away?
93;00:08:45,025;00:08:46,108;She'll be safer in Dorne.
94;00:08:46,359;00:08:48,194;Yes, I know how concerned you are
94;00:08:46,359;00:08:48,194;for her safety.
95;00:08:48,278;00:08:50,070;It so happens that I am.
96;00:08:50,155;00:08:53,449;Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl
96;00:08:50,155;00:08:53,449;and I don't blame her at all for you.
97;00:08:54,576;00:08:56,118;So clever.
98;00:08:57,245;00:09:01,081;Aren't you always so clever
98;00:08:57,245;00:09:01,081;with your schemes and your plots?
99;00:09:02,292;00:09:03,959;Schemes and plots are the same thing.
100;00:09:04,211;00:09:06,212;They are going to attack us.
101;00:09:06,296;00:09:07,755;We need to be ready.
102;00:09:07,839;00:09:10,090;No need to concern yourself over it.
103;00:09:10,175;00:09:13,886;The king is taking personal charge
103;00:09:10,175;00:09:13,886;of siege preparations.
104;00:09:13,970;00:09:17,181;May I ask specifically
104;00:09:13,970;00:09:17,181;what the king has in mind?
105;00:09:17,265;00:09:19,683;You may, specifically,
105;00:09:17,265;00:09:19,683;or you may ask vaguely.
106;00:09:19,768;00:09:21,810;The answer will be the same.
107;00:09:26,942;00:09:29,818;It's important that we talk about this.
108;00:09:33,114;00:09:35,616;It's the king's royal prerogative
109;00:09:35,700;00:09:39,245;to withhold sensitive information
109;00:09:35,700;00:09:39,245;from his councilors.
110;00:09:48,046;00:09:50,005;It's wildfire.
111;00:09:50,257;00:09:51,590;Wildfire?
112;00:09:53,927;00:09:55,678;You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?
113;00:09:56,638;00:09:58,597;No.
113;00:09:56,638;00:09:58,597;That's a lie right there.
114;00:09:58,723;00:10:00,808;It is not a lie. Why would I lie?
115;00:10:02,185;00:10:03,602;Tell me,
116;00:10:03,687;00:10:07,356;if the vile allegations
116;00:10:03,687;00:10:07,356;against my brother and sister are true,
117;00:10:08,024;00:10:11,110;do you think it will make Jaime
117;00:10:08,024;00:10:11,110;more likely to kill you or less likely?
118;00:10:12,529;00:10:15,072;When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean.
119;00:10:15,615;00:10:16,782;I'm telling you the truth.
120;00:10:16,866;00:10:18,325;The smart money would be on more likely.
121;00:10:18,410;00:10:19,618;She's making wildfire.
122;00:10:19,703;00:10:22,496;But then perhaps his own unnatural urges
122;00:10:19,703;00:10:22,496;will give him sympathy for yours.
123;00:10:22,580;00:10:24,164;The Alchemists' Guild
123;00:10:22,580;00:10:24,164;is being commissioned.
124;00:10:24,249;00:10:25,666;I suppose there's only one way to find out.
125;00:10:25,792;00:10:28,502;They have thousands of pots
125;00:10:25,792;00:10:28,502;already stored in their vaults.
126;00:10:28,586;00:10:30,462;They are planning to launch it
126;00:10:28,586;00:10:30,462;from the city walls
127;00:10:30,547;00:10:32,339;into Stannis' ships and armies.
128;00:10:32,882;00:10:34,174;Please.
129;00:10:35,635;00:10:37,720;When did she tell you this?
130;00:10:39,264;00:10:41,432;I heard her talking with the pyromancer.
131;00:10:42,475;00:10:46,937;And the other night, after I left her,
131;00:10:42,475;00:10:46,937;she went to meet him.
132;00:10:47,897;00:10:49,023;I swear to you.
133;00:10:49,107;00:10:50,524;Swear to me on what?
134;00:10:50,734;00:10:51,775;On my life.
135;00:10:52,068;00:10:53,319;But I don't care about your life.
136;00:10:53,820;00:10:57,323;In the light of the Seven,
136;00:10:53,820;00:10:57,323;by all that is holy and right,
137;00:10:57,407;00:10:59,867;I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow...
138;00:10:59,951;00:11:03,620;All right, all right. Enough.
138;00:10:59,951;00:11:03,620;Even torturing you is boring.
139;00:11:03,872;00:11:05,456;Just get out.
140;00:11:09,544;00:11:11,003;Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn
141;00:11:11,087;00:11:13,881;to please kill you
141;00:11:11,087;00:11:13,881;if anything should happen to me.
142;00:11:14,090;00:11:16,925;Please kill me if anything
142;00:11:14,090;00:11:16,925;should happen to Lord Tyrion.
143;00:11:19,471;00:11:21,138;It will be my pleasure.
144;00:11:25,602;00:11:27,186;Your Grace.
145;00:11:27,270;00:11:28,937;What is it?
146;00:11:29,022;00:11:31,231;I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace.
147;00:11:31,316;00:11:33,859;I wanted to let you know
147;00:11:31,316;00:11:33,859;that people grieve for him.
148;00:11:33,943;00:11:36,028;Fools love a fool.
149;00:11:36,112;00:11:40,074;I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was,
149;00:11:36,112;00:11:40,074;not the man he grew to be.
150;00:11:40,283;00:11:41,450;I need to speak to you
151;00:11:41,534;00:11:43,535;about what I saw in that cave.
151;00:11:41,534;00:11:43,535;I thought I made it clear to you
152;00:11:43,620;00:11:44,953;there'd be no need to speak to me
152;00:11:43,620;00:11:44,953;on this matter.
153;00:11:45,038;00:11:46,038;Your Grace, I...
154;00:11:46,122;00:11:48,457;I've never known you to need
154;00:11:46,122;00:11:48,457;to hear a thing twice.
155;00:11:50,126;00:11:52,127;And I've never known you
155;00:11:50,126;00:11:52,127;to hide from the truth.
156;00:11:52,253;00:11:53,629;You've come to lecture me on truth?
157;00:11:53,713;00:11:55,047;I've come to tell you that what I saw...
158;00:11:55,131;00:11:57,299;All my brother's bannermen
158;00:11:55,131;00:11:57,299;have come to my side.
159;00:11:59,636;00:12:02,471;Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards.
160;00:12:03,014;00:12:04,515;They won't be able to resist us now.
161;00:12:04,599;00:12:06,225;Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne.
162;00:12:06,309;00:12:08,727;Nothing is worth what this will cost you,
162;00:12:06,309;00:12:08,727;not even the Iron...
163;00:12:08,812;00:12:10,437;I'll hear no more about it.
164;00:12:17,987;00:12:20,864;Take a company of men,
164;00:12:17,987;00:12:20,864;secure the perimeter.
165;00:12:21,991;00:12:23,909;When do we sail for King's Landing?
166;00:12:23,993;00:12:26,245;As soon as I've consolidated my troops.
167;00:12:26,538;00:12:28,205;We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet.
168;00:12:28,832;00:12:30,499;Once Blackwater Bay is cleared,
169;00:12:30,583;00:12:33,752;we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep
169;00:12:30,583;00:12:33,752;and take the city.
170;00:12:34,504;00:12:36,880;And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
171;00:12:38,258;00:12:40,175;That's not your concern.
172;00:12:40,260;00:12:43,804;If you take King's Landing
172;00:12:40,260;00:12:43,804;with her by your side, the victory will be hers.
173;00:12:43,888;00:12:46,140;I never thought I'd have reason
173;00:12:43,888;00:12:46,140;to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?
174;00:12:47,016;00:12:48,851;Loyal service means telling hard truths.
175;00:12:49,394;00:12:51,186;Oh, truth again.
176;00:12:51,771;00:12:53,689;All right, what's the truth?
177;00:12:55,191;00:12:56,567;The hard truth?
178;00:12:56,651;00:13:00,446;She's a foreigner
178;00:12:56,651;00:13:00,446;preaching her foreign religion.
179;00:13:00,905;00:13:04,575;Some believe she whispers orders in your ear
179;00:13:00,905;00:13:04,575;and you obey.
180;00:13:08,371;00:13:09,371;What do you believe?
181;00:13:13,168;00:13:15,919;You won those bannermen from Renly.
182;00:13:16,921;00:13:18,547;Don't lose them to her.
183;00:13:23,887;00:13:26,305;We set out for King's Landing
183;00:13:23,887;00:13:26,305;without Lady Melisandre.
184;00:13:29,434;00:13:30,851;And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
185;00:13:32,729;00:13:34,813;Your Grace, I'm honored,
185;00:13:32,729;00:13:34,813;but my time on the sea
186;00:13:34,898;00:13:37,483;was spent evading ships, not attacking them.
187;00:13:37,567;00:13:39,151;The other lords won't be happy.
188;00:13:40,028;00:13:42,237;Most of those lords
188;00:13:40,028;00:13:42,237;should consider themselves lucky
189;00:13:42,322;00:13:44,573;I don't hang them for treason.
190;00:13:46,618;00:13:49,745;Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.
191;00:14:07,972;00:14:09,723;I've got it! I've got it!
192;00:14:09,807;00:14:12,059;So it's that one there at the top,
192;00:14:09,807;00:14:12,059;on the right.
193;00:14:13,895;00:14:16,563;Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit.
194;00:14:16,648;00:14:20,150;Stannis has more infantry,
194;00:14:16,648;00:14:20,150;more ships, more horses.
195;00:14:20,235;00:14:21,735;What do we have?
196;00:14:22,070;00:14:24,446;There's that mind of yours
196;00:14:22,070;00:14:24,446;you keep going on about.
197;00:14:24,531;00:14:27,991;Well, I've never actually been able
197;00:14:24,531;00:14:27,991;to kill people with it.
198;00:14:28,076;00:14:30,452;Good thing. I'd be out of a job.
199;00:14:31,454;00:14:32,621;What about your father?
200;00:14:33,831;00:14:35,249;He hasn't sent a raven in weeks.
201;00:14:36,543;00:14:37,918;He's very busy.
202;00:14:38,002;00:14:41,922;Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark
202;00:14:38,002;00:14:41,922;is time-consuming.
203;00:14:42,423;00:14:44,216;We won't be able to
203;00:14:42,423;00:14:44,216;hold the city against Stannis,
204;00:14:44,300;00:14:45,801;not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.
205;00:14:45,885;00:14:48,095;Corruption.
205;00:14:45,885;00:14:48,095;Yes!
206;00:14:48,596;00:14:52,641;We are swollen, bloated, foul.
207;00:14:53,560;00:14:56,019;Brother fornicates with sister
207;00:14:53,560;00:14:56,019;in the bed of kings
208;00:14:56,104;00:14:59,439;and we're surprised
208;00:14:56,104;00:14:59,439;when the fruit of their incest is rotten?
209;00:15:00,692;00:15:03,485;Yes, a rotten king.
210;00:15:04,237;00:15:06,446;It's hard to argue with his assessment.
211;00:15:06,531;00:15:08,740;Not after what he did to your birthday present.
212;00:15:09,534;00:15:11,660;The king is a lost cause.
213;00:15:11,744;00:15:14,079;It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.
214;00:15:14,163;00:15:17,833;A dancing king,
214;00:15:14,163;00:15:17,833;prancing down his bloodstained halls
215;00:15:17,917;00:15:21,503;to the tune of a twisted demon monkey.
216;00:15:23,673;00:15:25,674;You have to admire his imagination.
217;00:15:25,925;00:15:27,676;He's talking about you.
218;00:15:28,344;00:15:30,929;What? Demon monkey?
219;00:15:31,014;00:15:33,348;People think you're pulling the king's strings.
220;00:15:33,433;00:15:35,559;They blame you for the city's ills.
221;00:15:35,643;00:15:37,936;Blame me? I'm trying to save them.
222;00:15:38,021;00:15:40,272;You don't need to convince me.
223;00:15:41,733;00:15:43,525;Demon monkey.
224;00:16:13,181;00:16:14,765;Yeah, come on.
225;00:16:14,849;00:16:16,224;You're the crew of the Sea Bitch?
226;00:16:17,310;00:16:19,770;I'm your commander. Welcome.
227;00:16:22,398;00:16:23,607;Stop.
228;00:16:24,525;00:16:25,901;Stop!
229;00:16:26,569;00:16:29,154;Your captain commands you to stop!
230;00:16:30,073;00:16:32,282;Where are we headed, Captain?
231;00:16:33,910;00:16:37,329;The Stony Shore, to raid their villages.
232;00:16:37,538;00:16:40,874;There'll be spoils in it for you, and women,
232;00:16:37,538;00:16:40,874;if you do yourjobs well.
233;00:16:41,167;00:16:44,086;And who decides if we've done ourjobs well?
234;00:16:45,755;00:16:47,255;I do.
235;00:16:48,049;00:16:49,424;Your captain.
236;00:16:51,594;00:16:57,599;I have been reaving and raping
236;00:16:51,594;00:16:57,599;since before you left Balon's balls, Captain.
237;00:16:58,768;00:17:02,604;Don't reckon I've got much use
237;00:16:58,768;00:17:02,604;for your ideas on how to do it.
238;00:17:03,106;00:17:05,899;Don't reckon I've got much use
238;00:17:03,106;00:17:05,899;for a captain at all.
239;00:17:06,359;00:17:09,986;I'm thinking I can do the job of captain
239;00:17:06,359;00:17:09,986;real well myself.
240;00:17:10,655;00:17:12,239;All I need is a ship.
241;00:17:13,074;00:17:17,119;You wouldn't know where I could
241;00:17:13,074;00:17:17,119;find myself a ship now, would you?
242;00:17:21,332;00:17:24,918;You could do that,
242;00:17:21,332;00:17:24,918;take the ship, head out on your own.
243;00:17:25,128;00:17:28,839;And I will hunt you down, drag you back here
243;00:17:25,128;00:17:28,839;in chains and hang you for a traitor.
244;00:17:29,298;00:17:31,466;Stop. We yield.
245;00:17:35,263;00:17:37,973;Congratulations on your first command.
246;00:17:38,057;00:17:40,684;Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.
247;00:17:40,768;00:17:41,977;Oh, I'm not here for you.
248;00:17:42,645;00:17:45,397;I was just on my way to Red Harbor.
249;00:17:45,481;00:17:49,109;I've got 30 ships.
249;00:17:45,481;00:17:49,109;There's nowhere to put them here.
250;00:17:49,193;00:17:50,736;Too narrow.
251;00:17:51,320;00:17:54,114;You'd better get out there.
251;00:17:51,320;00:17:54,114;Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.
252;00:17:54,741;00:17:56,408;That would never happen.
253;00:17:56,492;00:17:59,953;My crew would wait on deck
253;00:17:56,492;00:17:59,953;for a year if I asked them to.
254;00:18:00,705;00:18:02,372;This lot, though...
255;00:18:04,250;00:18:06,209;Enjoy the Stony Shore.
256;00:18:11,257;00:18:13,675;Come on, I'll take you out.
257;00:18:14,302;00:18:15,761;Who are you?
258;00:18:15,845;00:18:17,846;Dagmer, your first mate.
259;00:18:19,056;00:18:21,266;Why aren't you with the rest of them?
260;00:18:21,350;00:18:25,103;Or did they send you to row me out
260;00:18:21,350;00:18:25,103;and dump me halfway in the sea?
261;00:18:25,188;00:18:26,480;That would be good for a laugh.
262;00:18:26,564;00:18:29,608;They're not gonna respect you
262;00:18:26,564;00:18:29,608;until you prove yourself.
263;00:18:29,692;00:18:32,861;And how am I supposed to prove myself
263;00:18:29,692;00:18:32,861;by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
264;00:18:32,945;00:18:34,362;You're not.
265;00:18:35,031;00:18:40,202;And yet that's the task my father has given me
265;00:18:35,031;00:18:40,202;to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.
266;00:18:40,870;00:18:42,996;They're all Iron Islanders.
267;00:18:43,164;00:18:46,625;Do they do as they're told
267;00:18:43,164;00:18:46,625;or do they do as they like?
268;00:18:53,716;00:18:56,843;The Stony Shore's not far
268;00:18:53,716;00:18:56,843;from Torrhen's Square.
269;00:18:57,053;00:18:59,262;The seat of the House of Tallhart,
270;00:19:04,227;00:19:06,770;What, you don't think we could take it?
270;00:19:04,227;00:19:06,770;No, we could.
271;00:19:06,854;00:19:08,939;We could never hold it
271;00:19:06,854;00:19:08,939;for more than a few days.
272;00:19:09,023;00:19:11,316;As soon as Winterfell got word
272;00:19:09,023;00:19:11,316;that we'd taken Torrhen's Square,
273;00:19:11,400;00:19:14,444;the Starks would send their men
273;00:19:11,400;00:19:14,444;to take it back.
274;00:19:15,238;00:19:16,279;And then...
275;00:19:23,871;00:19:25,330;Take me to my ship.
276;00:19:30,002;00:19:33,004;The Starks have overextended their lines.
277;00:19:33,339;00:19:34,923;Now that summer's over,
277;00:19:33,339;00:19:34,923;they'll have a hard time
278;00:19:35,007;00:19:36,842;keeping their men and horses fed.
279;00:19:36,926;00:19:39,010;The Starks understand winter
279;00:19:36,926;00:19:39,010;better than we ever will.
280;00:19:39,095;00:19:40,929;The cold won't beat them.
281;00:19:41,013;00:19:45,725;Our spies report growing discontent
281;00:19:41,013;00:19:45,725;among the Northern lords.
282;00:19:45,810;00:19:50,272;They want to return home
282;00:19:45,810;00:19:50,272;and gather the harvest before the crops turn.
283;00:19:50,356;00:19:53,108;And I'm sure if those same spies
283;00:19:50,356;00:19:53,108;snuck into our own encampments,
284;00:19:53,192;00:19:56,152;they would report growing discontent
284;00:19:53,192;00:19:56,152;amongst the Southern lords.
285;00:19:56,571;00:19:58,780;This is war, no one's content.
286;00:20:01,450;00:20:04,327;We've underestimated
286;00:20:01,450;00:20:04,327;the Stark boy for too long.
287;00:20:04,412;00:20:07,956;He has a good mind for warfare,
287;00:20:04,412;00:20:07,956;his men worship him.
288;00:20:08,040;00:20:12,627;And as long as he keeps winning battles,
288;00:20:08,040;00:20:12,627;they'll keep believing he is King in the North.
289;00:20:13,713;00:20:15,213;You've been waiting for him to fail.
290;00:20:15,339;00:20:19,259;He is not going to fail, not without our help.
291;00:20:23,139;00:20:24,848;So how do we stop him?
292;00:20:24,932;00:20:26,766;We've worked
292;00:20:24,932;00:20:26,766;through the night, my lord.
293;00:20:27,351;00:20:29,644;Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.
294;00:20:29,729;00:20:31,688;Yes, I think you would, Reginald.
295;00:20:31,772;00:20:35,483;And because you're my cousin,
295;00:20:31,772;00:20:35,483;I might even let you wake from that sleep.
296;00:20:36,903;00:20:39,112;Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you.
297;00:20:39,822;00:20:41,031;My wife's in Lannisport.
298;00:20:41,115;00:20:43,158;Well, then you'd better start riding.
299;00:20:44,702;00:20:47,996;Go, before I change my mind
299;00:20:44,702;00:20:47,996;and send her your head.
300;00:20:48,873;00:20:50,123;If your name wasn't Lannister,
301;00:20:50,207;00:20:53,835;you'd be scrubbing out pots
301;00:20:50,207;00:20:53,835;in the cook's tent. Go!
302;00:20:57,256;00:20:58,840;Not wine, water.
303;00:20:59,717;00:21:00,842;We'll be here for some time.
304;00:21:06,140;00:21:07,140;Girl.
305;00:21:08,976;00:21:10,644;Where are you from?
306;00:21:10,853;00:21:12,520;Maidenpool, my lord.
307;00:21:13,564;00:21:17,067;And who are the Lords of Maidenpool?
307;00:21:13,564;00:21:17,067;Remind me.
308;00:21:17,735;00:21:19,945;House Mooton, my lord.
309;00:21:20,029;00:21:21,738;And what is their sigil?
310;00:21:26,327;00:21:28,119;A red salmon.
311;00:21:28,204;00:21:30,872;I think a Maidenpool girl
311;00:21:28,204;00:21:30,872;would remember that.
312;00:21:32,667;00:21:34,042;You're a Northerner, aren't you?
313;00:21:35,544;00:21:38,380;Good. One more time, where are you from?
314;00:21:38,839;00:21:40,632;Barrowton, my lord.
315;00:21:40,716;00:21:42,592;House Dustin.
316;00:21:42,677;00:21:45,345;Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.
317;00:21:47,682;00:21:50,934;And what do they say
317;00:21:47,682;00:21:50,934;of Robb Stark in the North?
318;00:21:53,938;00:21:56,439;They call him the Young Wolf.
319;00:21:56,524;00:21:57,816;And?
320;00:21:58,901;00:22:01,194;They say he rides into battle
320;00:21:58,901;00:22:01,194;on the back of a giant direwolf.
321;00:22:03,990;00:22:07,534;They say he can turn into
321;00:22:03,990;00:22:07,534;a wolf himself when he wants.
322;00:22:08,244;00:22:09,577;They say he can't be killed.
323;00:22:11,247;00:22:12,539;And do you believe them?
324;00:22:14,000;00:22:15,583;No, my lord.
325;00:22:16,919;00:22:18,712;Anyone can be killed.
326;00:22:26,595;00:22:27,929;Fetch that water.
327;00:23:08,804;00:23:10,680;A girl says nothing.
328;00:23:13,976;00:23:16,061;A girl keeps her mouth closed.
329;00:23:17,313;00:23:22,150;No one hears,
329;00:23:17,313;00:23:22,150;and friends may talk in secret, yes?
330;00:23:26,822;00:23:28,448;A boy becomes a girl.
331;00:23:28,657;00:23:29,991;I was always a girl.
332;00:23:30,076;00:23:32,160;And I was always aware.
333;00:23:32,787;00:23:34,954;But the girl keeps secrets.
334;00:23:35,831;00:23:38,291;It is not for a man to spoil them.
335;00:23:40,336;00:23:41,586;You're one of them now.
336;00:23:44,340;00:23:46,466;I should have let you burn.
337;00:23:49,386;00:23:51,554;And you fetch water for one of them now.
338;00:23:52,515;00:23:55,350;Why is this right for you and wrong for me?
339;00:23:56,352;00:23:58,770;I didn't have a choice.
339;00:23:56,352;00:23:58,770;You did.
340;00:23:59,647;00:24:00,814;I did.
341;00:24:01,899;00:24:03,399;And here we are.
342;00:24:06,570;00:24:08,154;A man pays his debts.
343;00:24:08,781;00:24:10,365;A man owes three.
344;00:24:10,574;00:24:11,825;Three what?
345;00:24:13,202;00:24:16,204;The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl.
346;00:24:16,831;00:24:19,415;And only death may pay for life.
347;00:24:20,626;00:24:23,086;You saved me and the two I was with.
348;00:24:23,379;00:24:26,214;You stole three deaths from the Red God.
349;00:24:29,760;00:24:31,553;We have to give them back.
350;00:24:34,890;00:24:36,933;Speak three names
351;00:24:37,726;00:24:39,936;and the man will do the rest.
352;00:24:42,022;00:24:43,481;Three lives I will give you,
353;00:24:43,566;00:24:45,275;no more, no less,
354;00:24:45,359;00:24:46,651;and we're done.
355;00:24:47,194;00:24:48,820;I can name anyone
356;00:24:50,030;00:24:51,531;and you'll kill him?
357;00:24:52,575;00:24:54,409;A man has said.
358;00:24:57,705;00:24:58,913;The one who tortures everyone.
359;00:24:59,331;00:25:00,748;A man needs a name.
360;00:25:00,833;00:25:02,750;I don't know his name.
361;00:25:03,252;00:25:04,669;They call him the Tickler.
362;00:25:04,753;00:25:06,421;That is enough.
363;00:25:07,673;00:25:10,633;Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty.
364;00:25:24,982;00:25:26,024;He's not here yet.
365;00:25:26,108;00:25:28,735;He'd have seen us, blown the horn.
366;00:25:28,819;00:25:30,320;When will he come?
367;00:25:30,404;00:25:33,072;The Halfhand does things in his own time.
368;00:25:33,157;00:25:35,533;My uncle told me stories about him.
369;00:25:35,618;00:25:37,035;Most of them are true.
370;00:25:37,119;00:25:40,413;I heard the Halfhand
370;00:25:37,119;00:25:40,413;spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.
371;00:25:40,497;00:25:41,706;The whole winter.
372;00:25:41,790;00:25:44,250;He was north of the Skirling Pass
372;00:25:41,790;00:25:44,250;when the snows came.
373;00:25:44,335;00:25:46,211;Had to wait for the thaw.
374;00:25:46,295;00:25:49,964;So it is possible for someone
374;00:25:46,295;00:25:49,964;to survive out here on their own.
375;00:25:51,383;00:25:53,259;Well, possible for the Halfhand.
376;00:25:53,344;00:25:55,136;Beautiful, isn't it?
377;00:25:55,638;00:25:57,722;Gilly would love it here.
378;00:25:58,224;00:26:01,559;There's nothing more sickening
378;00:25:58,224;00:26:01,559;than a man in love.
379;00:26:28,879;00:26:31,172;About time you did something.
380;00:26:31,715;00:26:33,675;At least you'll keep warm.
381;00:26:35,636;00:26:38,012;The Fist of the First Men.
382;00:26:38,681;00:26:41,349;Think of how old this place is.
383;00:26:42,059;00:26:44,560;Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals,
384;00:26:44,645;00:26:47,105;before the Andals took Westeros
384;00:26:44,645;00:26:47,105;from the First Men.
385;00:26:47,189;00:26:49,899;Before I die, please, stop talking.
386;00:26:50,776;00:26:55,780;Thousands and thousands of years ago,
386;00:26:50,776;00:26:55,780;the First Men stood here where we're standing
387;00:26:55,864;00:26:57,991;all through the long night.
388;00:27:00,202;00:27:02,829;What do you think they were like,
388;00:27:00,202;00:27:02,829;the First Men?
389;00:27:02,913;00:27:04,247;Stupid.
390;00:27:04,331;00:27:07,417;Smart people don't find themselves
390;00:27:04,331;00:27:07,417;in places like this.
391;00:27:07,501;00:27:09,627;I think they were afraid.
392;00:27:11,672;00:27:14,048;I think they came here
392;00:27:11,672;00:27:14,048;to get away from something.
393;00:27:15,467;00:27:17,552;And I don't think it worked.
394;00:27:21,682;00:27:22,807;Wildlings?
395;00:27:25,561;00:27:27,812;One blast is for rangers returning.
396;00:27:27,896;00:27:29,522;Wildlings is two blasts.
397;00:27:29,732;00:27:32,984;So you got to stand there waiting,
398;00:27:33,569;00:27:35,111;wondering.
399;00:27:35,195;00:27:36,696;One blast for friends,
400;00:27:38,157;00:27:39,657;two for foes.
401;00:27:41,827;00:27:43,536;And three for White Walkers.
402;00:27:47,791;00:27:49,709;It's been a thousand years,
403;00:27:49,793;00:27:52,503;but that's the only time
403;00:27:49,793;00:27:52,503;they blow the horn three times.
404;00:27:52,588;00:27:54,797;But if it's been a thousand years,
404;00:27:52,588;00:27:54,797;how do you know?
405;00:27:55,507;00:27:58,468;Well...
405;00:27:55,507;00:27:58,468;I read it in a book.
406;00:27:59,511;00:28:00,553;Look.
407;00:28:02,556;00:28:04,265;It's Qhorin Halfhand.
408;00:28:04,350;00:28:07,143;Aye, we'll live another day.
409;00:28:08,270;00:28:09,604;Hurrah.
410;00:28:20,032;00:28:21,783;Take care, my lord.
411;00:28:22,493;00:28:24,994;I remember reading an old sailors' proverb,
412;00:28:25,496;00:28:27,997;Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off.
413;00:28:28,123;00:28:31,626;Oh, I have not conducted this experiment.
414;00:28:32,169;00:28:34,170;It could well be true.
415;00:28:34,254;00:28:39,300;The substance burns so hot,
415;00:28:34,254;00:28:39,300;it melts wood, stone, even steel,
416;00:28:39,551;00:28:41,803;and, of course, flesh.
417;00:28:42,763;00:28:47,141;The substance burns so hot,
417;00:28:42,763;00:28:47,141;it melts flesh like tallow.
418;00:28:50,646;00:28:55,858;After the dragons died, wildfire was the key
418;00:28:50,646;00:28:55,858;to the Targaryen power.
419;00:28:57,319;00:28:59,028;My companion takes issue.
420;00:28:59,113;00:29:03,616;If I could tell you how many crazy old men
420;00:28:59,113;00:29:03,616;I've seen pushing carts around army camps
421;00:29:03,700;00:29:06,285;making grand claims
421;00:29:03,700;00:29:06,285;about jars full of pig shit.
422;00:29:07,329;00:29:10,665;No offense meant.
422;00:29:07,329;00:29:10,665;Our order does not deal in pig shit.
423;00:29:10,749;00:29:13,084;The substance is fire given form.
424;00:29:13,419;00:29:16,504;And we have been perfecting it
424;00:29:13,419;00:29:16,504;since the days of Maegor.
425;00:29:16,588;00:29:17,630;To do what?
426;00:29:17,714;00:29:21,384;The jars are put in catapults
426;00:29:17,714;00:29:21,384;and flung at the enemy.
427;00:29:22,010;00:29:24,011;How much do you have?
428;00:29:27,933;00:29:31,102;If you could get real soldiers
428;00:29:27,933;00:29:31,102;to man the catapults,
429;00:29:31,186;00:29:34,689;then maybe you'd hit
429;00:29:31,186;00:29:34,689;your target one time in ten,
430;00:29:34,773;00:29:37,859;but all the real soldiers
430;00:29:34,773;00:29:37,859;are in the Riverlands with your father.
431;00:29:37,943;00:29:39,944;My lord, this man is insulting.
432;00:29:40,028;00:29:42,155;I don't know if you've ever seen a battle,
432;00:29:40,028;00:29:42,155;old man,
433;00:29:42,239;00:29:43,781;but things can get a bit messy.
434;00:29:43,866;00:29:47,368;'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis,
434;00:29:43,866;00:29:47,368;he's flinging them right back at us.
435;00:29:47,494;00:29:50,413;Men die, men shit themselves, men run,
436;00:29:50,497;00:29:52,165;which means pots falling,
437;00:29:52,249;00:29:54,000;which means fire inside the walls,
438;00:29:54,084;00:29:58,838;which means the poor cunts trying to defend
438;00:29:54,084;00:29:58,838;the city end up burning it down.
439;00:29:59,089;00:30:00,923;My friend remains unconvinced.
440;00:30:01,008;00:30:05,094;He would not dare insult my order
440;00:30:01,008;00:30:05,094;whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.
441;00:30:05,179;00:30:07,597;Well, he's not living anymore.
442;00:30:08,182;00:30:10,725;And all his pots of wildfire
442;00:30:08,182;00:30:10,725;didn't help him, did they?
443;00:30:11,435;00:30:14,395;Men win wars, not magic tricks.
444;00:30:30,370;00:30:34,499;We have been working tirelessly,
444;00:30:30,370;00:30:34,499;day and night,
445;00:30:34,583;00:30:39,003;ever since your royal sister
445;00:30:34,583;00:30:39,003;commanded us to do so.
446;00:30:39,087;00:30:44,383;Our present count stands at 7,811.
447;00:30:44,968;00:30:50,181;Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet
447;00:30:44,968;00:30:50,181;and armies both.
448;00:30:50,265;00:30:52,225;This is a shit idea.
449;00:30:53,101;00:30:56,521;I'm afraid I have to concur
449;00:30:53,101;00:30:56,521;with my advisor, Wisdom Hallyne.
450;00:30:57,439;00:31:01,192;The contents of this room
450;00:30:57,439;00:31:01,192;could lay King's Landing low.
451;00:31:02,694;00:31:06,113;You won't be making wildfire
451;00:31:02,694;00:31:06,113;for my sister any longer.
452;00:31:08,408;00:31:10,743;You'll be making it for me.
453;00:31:41,483;00:31:44,318;He'll be able to feed himself from now on.
454;00:31:48,156;00:31:50,157;Let him sleep, Doreah.
455;00:31:50,242;00:31:52,076;Yes, Khaleesi.
456;00:31:54,830;00:31:56,664;He loves you.
457;00:32:00,669;00:32:03,671;I rewove this part of the top.
458;00:32:04,172;00:32:07,758;And I fixed the heel on this one.
459;00:32:07,843;00:32:09,677;Thank you, my friend.
460;00:32:11,847;00:32:14,849;Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you?
461;00:32:15,934;00:32:18,311;They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.
462;00:32:18,520;00:32:19,562;It is known.
463;00:32:20,856;00:32:23,774;And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos...
464;00:32:23,859;00:32:27,862;The last time a rich man gave me a dress,
464;00:32:23,859;00:32:27,862;he was selling me to Khal Drogo.
465;00:32:28,405;00:32:31,532;May he ride forever through the night lands.
466;00:32:34,328;00:32:37,371;Xaro is our host,
466;00:32:34,328;00:32:37,371;but we know nothing about him.
467;00:32:38,415;00:32:42,251;Men like to talk about other men
467;00:32:38,415;00:32:42,251;when they're happy.
468;00:32:49,968;00:32:52,261;You would look like a real princess
468;00:32:49,968;00:32:52,261;in Xaro's...
469;00:32:52,346;00:32:55,056;She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi.
470;00:33:01,480;00:33:03,731;You should wear it, Khaleesi.
471;00:33:03,815;00:33:06,901;You are their guest. It would be rude not to.
472;00:33:28,048;00:33:30,925;And you must visit the night market.
473;00:33:31,051;00:33:34,804;The Qartheen night market
473;00:33:31,051;00:33:34,804;is like no night market you've ever seen.
474;00:33:34,888;00:33:36,681;It sounds wonderful.
475;00:33:36,765;00:33:39,058;The Meereenis think they have a night market.
476;00:33:39,142;00:33:41,352;I will take you there myself.
477;00:33:41,436;00:33:43,604;Please excuse me for a moment.
478;00:33:48,110;00:33:49,193;What are they doing?
479;00:33:49,569;00:33:51,612;Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry.
480;00:33:52,823;00:33:54,407;Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot.
481;00:33:54,950;00:33:57,201;They can pry out the gems,
481;00:33:54,950;00:33:57,201;the rest is pure gold.
482;00:33:57,452;00:34:00,287;Very soft.
482;00:33:57,452;00:34:00,287;He can chop off as much as we can carry.
483;00:34:01,164;00:34:02,707;Or melt it. Very simple.
484;00:34:02,999;00:34:04,208;We are his guests!
485;00:34:04,292;00:34:07,128;You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.
486;00:34:07,337;00:34:08,796;Of course not, Khaleesi!
487;00:34:09,297;00:34:11,090;We will wait until we leave.
488;00:34:11,174;00:34:12,758;Not even when we leave.
489;00:34:13,009;00:34:14,677;Why not?
490;00:34:14,761;00:34:17,555;Our host saved us from the
490;00:34:14,761;00:34:17,555;Red Waste and you want to steal from him?
491;00:34:17,639;00:34:20,307;I will hear no more.
492;00:34:28,608;00:34:31,318;My brother used to say
492;00:34:28,608;00:34:31,318;the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do
493;00:34:31,403;00:34:33,571;was steal things better men have built.
494;00:34:33,655;00:34:35,072;It's not the only thing.
495;00:34:35,157;00:34:36,866;They're quite good at killing the better men.
496;00:34:37,492;00:34:39,452;That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.
497;00:34:39,536;00:34:41,412;Mother of Dragons.
498;00:34:43,248;00:34:46,417;On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth,
498;00:34:43,248;00:34:46,417;I welcome you.
499;00:34:48,837;00:34:50,296;A demonstration?
500;00:34:52,549;00:34:53,591;Take this gem.
501;00:34:54,426;00:34:55,468;Look at it.
502;00:34:56,970;00:34:58,512;Into its depths.
503;00:34:59,806;00:35:01,682;So many facets.
504;00:35:02,350;00:35:06,353;Look closely enough
504;00:35:02,350;00:35:06,353;and you can see yourself in them.
505;00:35:08,356;00:35:10,149;Often more than once.
506;00:35:13,987;00:35:17,406;Should you grow tired
506;00:35:13,987;00:35:17,406;of Xaro's baubles and trinkets,
507;00:35:17,491;00:35:20,618;it would be an honor
507;00:35:17,491;00:35:20,618;to host you at the House of the Undying.
508;00:35:21,703;00:35:24,705;You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons.
509;00:35:32,714;00:35:34,840;My apologies.
510;00:35:34,925;00:35:36,926;Pyat Pree is one of the Thirteen.
511;00:35:37,010;00:35:40,137;It was customary for me
511;00:35:37,010;00:35:40,137;to extend him an invitation.
512;00:35:40,222;00:35:43,182;Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.
513;00:35:43,266;00:35:45,726;What is the House of the Undying?
514;00:35:45,852;00:35:49,688;It is where the warlocks go
514;00:35:45,852;00:35:49,688;to squint at dusty books
515;00:35:49,773;00:35:51,148;and drink shade of the evening.
516;00:35:51,233;00:35:55,194;It turns their lips blue and their minds soft.
517;00:35:55,278;00:35:59,865;So soft, they actually believe
517;00:35:55,278;00:35:59,865;their parlor tricks are magic.
518;00:36:04,120;00:36:05,913;You watch over her.
519;00:36:08,875;00:36:09,917;Do I know you?
520;00:36:10,293;00:36:11,710;I know you.
521;00:36:12,087;00:36:14,588;Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
522;00:36:15,757;00:36:17,091;Who are you?
523;00:36:17,717;00:36:19,301;I'm no one.
524;00:36:19,594;00:36:21,512;But she is the Mother of Dragons.
525;00:36:22,138;00:36:25,182;She needs true protectors,
525;00:36:22,138;00:36:25,182;now more than ever.
526;00:36:25,892;00:36:30,020;They shall come day and night
526;00:36:25,892;00:36:30,020;to see the wonder born into the world again.
527;00:36:30,105;00:36:33,107;And when they see, they shall lust,
528;00:36:33,483;00:36:36,944;for dragons are fire made flesh.
529;00:36:37,279;00:36:39,446;And fire is power.
530;00:36:50,166;00:36:52,293;It looked like Stannis.
531;00:36:53,211;00:36:56,005;To me it just looked like...
532;00:36:59,342;00:37:01,635;A shadow in the shape of a man.
533;00:37:01,720;00:37:03,762;In the shape of Stannis.
534;00:37:08,560;00:37:11,395;We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.
535;00:37:11,479;00:37:13,397;Will you stay there long, my lady?
536;00:37:13,481;00:37:16,817;Only long enough
536;00:37:13,481;00:37:16,817;to tell Robb what I have seen.
537;00:37:17,193;00:37:20,321;After that, I will leave for Winterfell.
538;00:37:21,656;00:37:24,116;My two youngest need me.
539;00:37:24,200;00:37:26,619;I've been away from them for far too long.
540;00:37:27,829;00:37:29,330;I never knew my mother.
541;00:37:30,999;00:37:32,124;I'm sorry.
542;00:37:33,335;00:37:35,961;My own mother died on the birthing bed
543;00:37:37,047;00:37:38,464;when I was very young.
544;00:37:42,427;00:37:44,345;It's a bloody business.
545;00:37:44,804;00:37:48,349;What comes after is even harder.
546;00:37:49,851;00:37:52,937;Once you're safely back
546;00:37:49,851;00:37:52,937;amongst your own people,
547;00:37:53,521;00:37:55,981;will you give me leave to go, my lady?
548;00:37:56,358;00:37:58,150;You mean to kill Stannis.
549;00:37:58,777;00:38:00,069;I swore a vow.
550;00:38:00,153;00:38:03,447;But Stannis has a great army around him.
551;00:38:03,531;00:38:06,158;His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.
552;00:38:06,242;00:38:07,534;I'm as good as any of them.
553;00:38:09,537;00:38:10,663;I should never have fled.
554;00:38:11,247;00:38:14,208;Renly's death was no fault of yours.
555;00:38:14,292;00:38:16,251;You served him bravely.
556;00:38:17,420;00:38:19,546;I only held him that once
557;00:38:20,924;00:38:22,675;as he was dying.
558;00:38:25,679;00:38:27,137;He's gone, Brienne.
559;00:38:28,223;00:38:31,558;You serve nothing and no one
559;00:38:28,223;00:38:31,558;by following him into the earth.
560;00:38:32,894;00:38:35,813;Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.
561;00:38:41,027;00:38:42,611;I do not know your son, my lady.
562;00:38:45,240;00:38:48,659;But I could serve you, if you would have me.
563;00:38:49,619;00:38:50,911;You have courage.
564;00:38:52,080;00:38:55,833;Not battle courage, perhaps,
564;00:38:52,080;00:38:55,833;but, I don't know,
565;00:38:57,210;00:38:59,420;a woman's kind of courage.
566;00:38:59,504;00:39:03,007;And I think that when the time comes,
566;00:38:59,504;00:39:03,007;you will not hold me back.
567;00:39:03,091;00:39:06,593;Promise me that you will not hold me back
567;00:39:03,091;00:39:06,593;from Stannis.
568;00:39:12,809;00:39:15,769;When the time comes,
568;00:39:12,809;00:39:15,769;I will not hold you back.
569;00:39:22,944;00:39:24,737;Then I am yours, my lady.
570;00:39:26,197;00:39:30,617;I will shield your back
570;00:39:26,197;00:39:30,617;and give my life for yours, if it comes to that.
571;00:39:30,952;00:39:33,912;I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
572;00:39:41,379;00:39:45,132;I vow that you shall always
572;00:39:41,379;00:39:45,132;have a place in my home
573;00:39:45,258;00:39:46,633;and at my table
574;00:39:47,218;00:39:51,472;and that I shall ask no service of you
574;00:39:47,218;00:39:51,472;that might bring you dishonor.
575;00:39:51,806;00:39:55,309;I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
576;00:39:58,480;00:40:01,148;And it's not just thieves, my lord.
577;00:40:01,232;00:40:03,776;There's wolves in them hills now,
578;00:40:03,860;00:40:06,028;more than I ever seen.
579;00:40:06,154;00:40:08,989;They come down in the night
579;00:40:06,154;00:40:08,989;and they kill my sheep.
580;00:40:09,824;00:40:12,910;My three sons is away
580;00:40:09,824;00:40:12,910;fighting for your brother, my lord.
581;00:40:13,161;00:40:16,455;They'll fight, keep fighting
581;00:40:13,161;00:40:16,455;till they're told to go home.
582;00:40:17,499;00:40:19,792;I have no one to man my flock now. Only me.
583;00:40:21,503;00:40:23,420;I can't keep watch all day and all night.
584;00:40:25,673;00:40:28,467;We can send two orphan boys
584;00:40:25,673;00:40:28,467;from Winterstown home with you
585;00:40:28,551;00:40:30,344;to help watch over your flock
586;00:40:30,470;00:40:32,012;if you can give them room and board.
587;00:40:32,180;00:40:35,140;My wife always prayed for more children.
588;00:40:35,266;00:40:37,601;We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord.
589;00:40:37,685;00:40:40,229;And may the gods bless you and yours.
590;00:40:43,358;00:40:44,358;Stop it.
591;00:40:46,194;00:40:48,987;If that's everyone,
591;00:40:46,194;00:40:48,987;I'm going to go for a ride before dark.
592;00:40:49,072;00:40:51,365;Good.
592;00:40:49,072;00:40:51,365;Hodor.
593;00:40:51,449;00:40:54,159;Hodor.
593;00:40:51,449;00:40:54,159;Ah! Lord Stark.
594;00:40:54,911;00:40:56,703;Torrhen's Square is under siege.
595;00:40:57,038;00:40:59,373;Torrhen's Square
595;00:40:57,038;00:40:59,373;is barely 40 leagues from here.
596;00:40:59,833;00:41:02,543;How can the Lannisters strike so far north?
597;00:41:03,128;00:41:05,462;Might be a raiding party led by the mountain.
598;00:41:05,547;00:41:07,548;Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.
599;00:41:07,715;00:41:08,799;We have to help them.
600;00:41:08,883;00:41:12,302;Most of the fighting men are away with Robb,
600;00:41:08,883;00:41:12,302;but I can gather 200 decent men.
601;00:41:12,387;00:41:13,637;Do you need so many?
602;00:41:13,721;00:41:16,515;If we can't protect our own bannermen,
602;00:41:13,721;00:41:16,515;why should they protect us?
603;00:41:18,101;00:41:20,561;Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need.
604;00:41:20,645;00:41:23,772;Won't take long, my lord.
604;00:41:20,645;00:41:23,772;Southerners don't do well up here.
605;00:41:34,409;00:41:36,743;So, what does it mean?
606;00:41:36,828;00:41:40,330;Ask your Maester Luwin.
606;00:41:36,828;00:41:40,330;He's the one studying books all the time.
607;00:41:40,415;00:41:43,750;I did ask him.
607;00:41:40,415;00:41:43,750;He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.
608;00:41:43,918;00:41:46,170;Must not mean anything, then.
609;00:41:46,254;00:41:47,296;You're lying.
610;00:41:47,380;00:41:50,257;You might be a little lord,
610;00:41:47,380;00:41:50,257;but don't you call me a liar.
611;00:41:50,466;00:41:53,260;You know what it means.
611;00:41:50,466;00:41:53,260;I never said I didn't.
612;00:41:53,595;00:41:55,262;You didn't give me an honest answer.
613;00:41:55,597;00:41:58,015;That's not the same as being a liar.
614;00:41:58,099;00:41:59,725;Well, it's not far off.
615;00:41:59,809;00:42:03,270;So, you've been dreaming
615;00:41:59,809;00:42:03,270;of a three-eyed raven again?
616;00:42:05,732;00:42:08,984;In the godswood,
616;00:42:05,732;00:42:08,984;you told me you didn't dream.
617;00:42:09,277;00:42:10,694;Now who's a liar?
618;00:42:15,074;00:42:16,491;What did you see in your dream?
619;00:42:19,454;00:42:20,913;Something bad?
620;00:42:22,123;00:42:23,624;Tell me, boy.
621;00:42:27,295;00:42:29,630;I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell.
622;00:42:31,466;00:42:33,800;I saw waves crashing against the gates
623;00:42:34,969;00:42:37,638;and the water came flowing over the walls...
624;00:42:40,141;00:42:42,267;It flooded the castle.
625;00:42:44,729;00:42:47,022;Drowned men were floating here,
626;00:42:47,106;00:42:49,107;in the yard.
627;00:42:51,819;00:42:53,946;Ser Rodrik was one of them.
628;00:42:56,783;00:42:59,368;The sea is hundreds of miles away.
629;00:42:59,661;00:43:00,661;I know.
630;00:43:01,496;00:43:04,122;It's just a stupid dream.
630;00:43:01,496;00:43:04,122;I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen.
631;00:43:04,457;00:43:06,250;Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.
632;00:43:06,334;00:43:07,918;Osha.
633;00:43:08,294;00:43:09,503;The three-eyed raven,
634;00:43:11,172;00:43:14,174;what do they say about it north of the Wall?
635;00:43:16,511;00:43:19,680;They say all sorts of crazy things
635;00:43:16,511;00:43:19,680;north of the Wall.
636;00:43:30,525;00:43:33,110;There.
636;00:43:30,525;00:43:33,110;Where?
637;00:43:33,194;00:43:34,861;On that mountain.
638;00:43:35,697;00:43:37,447;I don't see very well.
639;00:43:37,532;00:43:38,573;A fire.
640;00:43:41,619;00:43:43,370;There's a fire.
641;00:43:44,289;00:43:47,082;The people sitting around it
641;00:43:44,289;00:43:47,082;have better eyes than yours or mine.
642;00:43:47,875;00:43:50,711;When they see us coming,
642;00:43:47,875;00:43:50,711;that fire becomes a signal.
643;00:43:50,795;00:43:54,381;Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time
643;00:43:50,795;00:43:54,381;to throw a party in our honor.
644;00:43:54,465;00:43:56,466;How many wildlings have joined him?
645;00:43:56,551;00:43:59,553;From what we can tell, all of them.
646;00:44:04,892;00:44:07,477;Mance has gathered them all
646;00:44:04,892;00:44:07,477;like deer against the wolves.
647;00:44:07,562;00:44:09,229;They're almost ready to make their move.
648;00:44:10,523;00:44:13,066;Where?
648;00:44:10,523;00:44:13,066;Somewhere safe.
649;00:44:13,234;00:44:14,860;Somewhere south.
650;00:44:15,069;00:44:17,571;Can't just march into their midst.
651;00:44:18,197;00:44:21,491;And we can't wait for them here with nothing
651;00:44:18,197;00:44:21,491;but a pile of stones to protect us.
652;00:44:22,577;00:44:24,578;You saying we should fall back to the Wall?
653;00:44:25,330;00:44:27,831;Mance was one of us once.
654;00:44:28,583;00:44:30,584;Now he's one of them.
655;00:44:30,752;00:44:33,587;He's going to teach them
655;00:44:30,752;00:44:33,587;our way of doing things.
656;00:44:33,671;00:44:37,507;They'll hit us in force
656;00:44:33,671;00:44:37,507;and they won't run away when we hit back.
657;00:44:37,675;00:44:41,845;They're gonna be more organized than before,
657;00:44:37,675;00:44:41,845;more disciplined,
658;00:44:42,305;00:44:43,972;more like us.
659;00:44:44,432;00:44:48,268;So we need to be more like them,
659;00:44:44,432;00:44:48,268;do things their way.
660;00:44:49,103;00:44:51,688;Sneak in, kill Mance,
661;00:44:52,023;00:44:55,567;and scatter them to the winds
661;00:44:52,023;00:44:55,567;before they can march on the Wall.
662;00:44:55,902;00:44:58,779;And to do that...
662;00:44:55,902;00:44:58,779;We need to get rid of those lookouts.
663;00:44:58,863;00:45:01,198;It's not a job for 400 men.
664;00:45:01,282;00:45:03,950;I need to move fast and silent.
665;00:45:04,535;00:45:08,163;Harker, Stonesnake, Borba.
666;00:45:08,831;00:45:11,375;Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.
667;00:45:12,710;00:45:16,338;I've been called lots of things,
667;00:45:12,710;00:45:16,338;but that might be my first Lord Qhorin.
668;00:45:17,590;00:45:19,883;You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger.
669;00:45:19,967;00:45:21,676;I've fought and killed a wight.
670;00:45:21,761;00:45:23,678;How many rangers can say that?
671;00:45:23,763;00:45:25,097;He's the one?
672;00:45:26,974;00:45:29,184;Aye. You killed a wight.
673;00:45:29,936;00:45:33,772;You also let an old man beat you bloody
673;00:45:29,936;00:45:33,772;and take your sword.
674;00:45:35,441;00:45:36,691;Craster?
675;00:45:36,776;00:45:39,152;In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat.
676;00:45:42,740;00:45:45,158;I could take up Jon's duties
676;00:45:42,740;00:45:45,158;while he's gone, my lord.
677;00:45:46,494;00:45:48,453;It would be no trouble.
678;00:45:57,672;00:46:01,466;Well, I hope you make a better ranger
678;00:45:57,672;00:46:01,466;than you do a steward.
679;00:46:03,594;00:46:04,886;Go on.
680;00:46:12,603;00:46:14,312;So, tell me,
681;00:46:14,397;00:46:17,941;how long has your manservant
681;00:46:14,397;00:46:17,941;been in love with you?
682;00:46:18,025;00:46:21,611;He's not my manservant
682;00:46:18,025;00:46:21,611;and he's not in love with me.
683;00:46:21,737;00:46:23,363;He's my advisor,
684;00:46:23,906;00:46:25,157;my friend.
685;00:46:25,241;00:46:26,741;Unlikely.
686;00:46:26,868;00:46:29,744;I can almost always tell what a man wants.
687;00:46:29,829;00:46:32,038;And what about what a woman wants?
688;00:46:32,123;00:46:33,999;Much more complicated.
689;00:46:34,083;00:46:37,878;You, for example, what do you want?
690;00:46:39,088;00:46:41,715;To cross the Narrow Sea
690;00:46:39,088;00:46:41,715;and take back the Iron Throne.
691;00:46:41,799;00:46:43,216;Why?
692;00:46:43,301;00:46:45,177;Because I promised my khalasar
692;00:46:43,301;00:46:45,177;I'd protect them
693;00:46:45,261;00:46:47,304;and find them a safe home.
694;00:46:47,555;00:46:50,599;You want to conquer
694;00:46:47,555;00:46:50,599;the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?
695;00:46:50,683;00:46:52,809;I want them because they're mine by right.
696;00:46:53,186;00:46:56,146;The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.
697;00:46:56,272;00:46:57,731;Ah, a conqueror.
698;00:46:58,608;00:47:01,067;And how did you get all of this?
698;00:46:58,608;00:47:01,067;Did someone give it to you?
699;00:47:01,152;00:47:05,906;No. I come from nothing.
699;00:47:01,152;00:47:05,906;I hit the docks like a piece of cargo,
700;00:47:05,990;00:47:08,158;except someone normally cares
700;00:47:05,990;00:47:08,158;what happens to cargo.
701;00:47:08,242;00:47:10,911;So you wanted more than you had
701;00:47:08,242;00:47:10,911;and you took it.
702;00:47:11,245;00:47:14,998;You're a conqueror, too.
702;00:47:11,245;00:47:14,998;You're just less ambitious.
703;00:47:19,378;00:47:22,339;What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos?
704;00:47:22,924;00:47:25,091;At the gates of the city, you bled for me.
705;00:47:25,259;00:47:26,259;Why?
706;00:47:28,763;00:47:30,430;I will show you why.
707;00:47:34,101;00:47:37,270;The door and the vault
707;00:47:34,101;00:47:37,270;is made of Valyrian stone.
708;00:47:37,897;00:47:41,191;The hardest steel does not make a mark.
709;00:47:41,901;00:47:46,613;I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth
709;00:47:41,901;00:47:46,613;their weight in gold if they could break into it.
710;00:47:47,156;00:47:49,533;I made the same offer to the greatest thieves.
711;00:47:50,117;00:47:52,035;They all went home empty-handed.
712;00:47:52,870;00:47:55,288;The only thing that can open this door
713;00:47:55,873;00:47:57,582;is this key.
714;00:47:57,959;00:47:59,042;And behind the door?
715;00:48:03,130;00:48:04,548;And it can all be mine?
716;00:48:04,632;00:48:07,467;All? Let us say half.
717;00:48:09,845;00:48:14,099;More than enough
717;00:48:09,845;00:48:14,099;to buy horses, ships, armies...
718;00:48:14,308;00:48:16,017;Enough to go home.
719;00:48:16,811;00:48:18,895;All I have to do?
720;00:48:19,522;00:48:20,605;Is marry me.
721;00:48:21,607;00:48:24,067;That was a romantic proposal.
722;00:48:24,193;00:48:28,029;I've already married once for love,
722;00:48:24,193;00:48:28,029;but the gods stole her from me.
723;00:48:31,450;00:48:33,285;I come from nothing.
724;00:48:33,369;00:48:36,204;My mother and father
724;00:48:33,369;00:48:36,204;never owned a pair of shoes.
725;00:48:36,330;00:48:39,624;But marry me,
725;00:48:36,330;00:48:39,624;and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms
726;00:48:39,709;00:48:43,086;and our children
726;00:48:39,709;00:48:43,086;will be princes and princesses.
727;00:48:45,506;00:48:47,132;See?
728;00:48:47,216;00:48:49,926;I have more ambition than you thought.
729;00:48:51,470;00:48:55,098;The time is right,
729;00:48:51,470;00:48:55,098;Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name.
730;00:48:56,517;00:48:58,059;Robert Baratheon is dead.
731;00:49:05,276;00:49:07,360;If you cross the sea
731;00:49:05,276;00:49:07,360;with an army you bought...
732;00:49:07,445;00:49:09,779;The Seven Kingdoms
732;00:49:07,445;00:49:09,779;are at war with one another.
733;00:49:09,905;00:49:12,365;Four false kings destroying the country.
734;00:49:12,450;00:49:15,118;To win Westeros,
734;00:49:12,450;00:49:15,118;you need support from Westeros.
735;00:49:15,202;00:49:17,495;The usurper is dead.
736;00:49:17,580;00:49:20,999;The Starks fight the Lannisters,
736;00:49:17,580;00:49:20,999;and Baratheons fight each other.
737;00:49:21,083;00:49:24,377;According to your new friend
737;00:49:21,083;00:49:24,377;who earned your trust by cutting his hand?
738;00:49:24,462;00:49:27,505;The time to strike is now.
738;00:49:24,462;00:49:27,505;We need to find ships and an army
739;00:49:27,590;00:49:30,216;or we'll spend the rest of our lives
739;00:49:27,590;00:49:30,216;rotting away at the edge of the world.
740;00:49:30,301;00:49:32,802;Rich men do not become rich
740;00:49:30,301;00:49:32,802;by giving more than they get.
741;00:49:32,887;00:49:35,930;They'll give you ships and soldiers
741;00:49:32,887;00:49:35,930;and they'll own you forever.
742;00:49:36,015;00:49:39,184;Moving carefully is the hard way,
742;00:49:36,015;00:49:39,184;but it's the right way.
743;00:49:39,310;00:49:41,519;And if I'd listened to that advice
743;00:49:39,310;00:49:41,519;outside the gates of Qarth,
744;00:49:41,604;00:49:43,229;we'd all be dead by now.
745;00:49:43,314;00:49:46,483;I know the opportunity before you
745;00:49:43,314;00:49:46,483;seems like the last you'll ever have,
746;00:49:46,567;00:49:50,070;but you must...
746;00:49:46,567;00:49:50,070;Do not speak to me like I'm a child.
747;00:49:52,615;00:49:54,407;I only want...
747;00:49:52,615;00:49:54,407;What do you want?
748;00:49:55,076;00:49:56,534;Tell me.
749;00:49:57,244;00:50:00,246;To see you on the Iron Throne.
749;00:49:57,244;00:50:00,246;Why?
750;00:50:00,331;00:50:01,623;You have a good claim.
751;00:50:01,707;00:50:03,917;A title. A birthright.
752;00:50:05,252;00:50:07,671;But you have something more than that.
753;00:50:08,255;00:50:12,217;You may cover it up and deny it,
753;00:50:08,255;00:50:12,217;but you have a gentle heart.
754;00:50:12,301;00:50:15,470;You would not only be respected and feared,
754;00:50:12,301;00:50:15,470;you would be loved.
755;00:50:17,264;00:50:19,432;Someone who can rule and should rule.
756;00:50:19,558;00:50:22,519;Centuries come and go without
756;00:50:19,558;00:50:22,519;a person like that coming into the world.
757;00:50:24,146;00:50:28,608;There are times when I look at you
757;00:50:24,146;00:50:28,608;and I still can't believe you're real.
758;00:50:40,579;00:50:43,915;So what would you have me do,
758;00:50:40,579;00:50:43,915;as my advisor?
759;00:50:49,630;00:50:51,381;Make your own way.
760;00:50:51,841;00:50:54,592;Find your own ship. You only need one.
761;00:50:54,677;00:50:57,470;The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth.
762;00:50:59,473;00:51:01,474;And how do I get the ship?
763;00:51:01,726;00:51:03,560;I'll find it for you.
764;00:51:03,978;00:51:06,312;A sound ship with a good captain.
765;00:51:12,069;00:51:14,279;I look forward to meeting him.
766;00:51:17,867;00:51:19,659;Khaleesi.
767;00:51:49,565;00:51:51,483;You should stand sideface.
768;00:51:51,567;00:51:52,567;Sideface?
769;00:51:54,278;00:51:56,070;Sideways.
770;00:51:56,155;00:51:57,447;Why?
771;00:51:57,531;00:51:59,365;Smaller target.
772;00:52:01,827;00:52:03,411;Am I fighting someone?
773;00:52:03,662;00:52:04,746;You're practicing for a fight.
774;00:52:07,249;00:52:08,374;You should practice right.
775;00:52:12,087;00:52:13,254;Guards!
776;00:52:15,674;00:52:17,467;Did you see anything?
777;00:52:19,386;00:52:22,388;Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.
778;00:52:27,561;00:52:28,728;Go up the battlement.
779;00:52:37,279;00:52:38,696;Move away.
780;00:52:41,033;00:52:42,909;Stand back. He's dead.
