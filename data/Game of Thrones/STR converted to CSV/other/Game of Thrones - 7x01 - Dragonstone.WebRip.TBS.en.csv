﻿1;00:00:17,436;00:00:20,149;Winter has come.
2;00:00:20,269;00:00:21,685;The war is not over.
3;00:00:21,686;00:00:23,976;The true enemy won't
3;00:00:21,686;00:00:23,976;wait out the storm.
4;00:00:25,770;00:00:28,976;The King in the North!
4;00:00:25,770;00:00:28,976;The King in the North!
5;00:00:33,852;00:00:37,061;Our uncle Euron returned
5;00:00:33,852;00:00:37,061;home after a long absence.
6;00:00:39,473;00:00:42,532;He murdered our father,
6;00:00:39,473;00:00:42,532;and took the Salt Throne from Yara.
7;00:00:42,652;00:00:44,478;He would have murdered us
7;00:00:42,652;00:00:44,478;if we'd stayed.
8;00:00:44,598;00:00:48,686;Build me a thousand ships,
8;00:00:44,598;00:00:48,686;and I will give you this world.
9;00:00:50,811;00:00:52,018;There's a storm coming.
10;00:00:52,019;00:00:53,561;You'll be wanting
10;00:00:52,019;00:00:53,561;a roof tonight.
11;00:00:54,019;00:00:56,851;I don't have much, but I have
11;00:00:54,019;00:00:56,851;hidden a bit of silver
12;00:00:56,852;00:00:58,977;from the bandits.
13;00:00:59,186;00:01:00,519;What did you do?!
14;00:01:00,520;00:01:02,443;They'll both be dead
14;00:01:00,520;00:01:02,443;come winter.
15;00:01:03,102;00:01:05,018;Cold winds
15;00:01:03,102;00:01:05,018;are rising in the North.
16;00:01:05,019;00:01:06,685;We need good men to help us.
17;00:01:06,686;00:01:09,893;You can still help a lot more
17;00:01:06,686;00:01:09,893;than you've harmed, Clegane.
18;00:01:09,894;00:01:11,520;It's not too late for you.
19;00:01:12,561;00:01:14,227;Send me to Oldtown.
20;00:01:14,228;00:01:15,936;I'm to be the new maester.
21;00:01:17,186;00:01:19,602;The Citadel has the world's
21;00:01:17,186;00:01:19,602;greatest library.
22;00:01:19,603;00:01:22,060;I'll learn about things

23;00:01:23,561;00:01:24,851;when they come.
24;00:01:28,311;00:01:30,061;Let go of me!
25;00:01:38,269;00:01:40,311;Are you sure
25;00:01:38,269;00:01:40,311;you're ready for this?
26;00:01:40,686;00:01:44,645;I'm the three-eyed raven.
26;00:01:40,686;00:01:44,645;I have to be ready for this.
27;00:01:46,811;00:01:49,520;Do you know who had this table
27;00:01:46,811;00:01:49,520;carved and painted, Ser Davos?
28;00:01:49,728;00:01:50,962;Aegon Targaryen.
29;00:01:51,436;00:01:54,310;Aegon used to live here, and the
29;00:01:51,436;00:01:54,310;Targaryens built this castle.
30;00:01:54,311;00:01:55,591;Aye. So they did.
31;00:01:55,640;00:01:59,061;I want us both to go home.
31;00:01:55,640;00:01:59,061;But they took it from us.
32;00:01:59,269;00:02:00,728;How do we go home?
33;00:02:01,353;00:02:03,193;You're in the great game now,
34;00:02:03,394;00:02:07,061;and the great game's
34;00:02:03,394;00:02:07,061;terrifying. Are you afraid?
35;00:02:09,019;00:02:12,310;My name is Arya Stark.
35;00:02:09,019;00:02:12,310;I want you to know that.
36;00:02:53,102;00:02:56,893;You're wondering why
36;00:02:53,102;00:02:56,893;I brought you all here.
37;00:02:56,894;00:03:00,352;After all, we just had a feast.
38;00:03:00,353;00:03:03,310;Since when does old Walder
39;00:03:03,311;00:03:06,310;give us two feasts
39;00:03:03,311;00:03:06,310;in a single fortnight?
40;00:03:08,811;00:03:11,769;Well, it's no good being
40;00:03:08,811;00:03:11,769;Lord of the Riverlands
41;00:03:11,770;00:03:14,143;if you can't celebrate
41;00:03:11,770;00:03:14,143;with your family.
42;00:03:14,144;00:03:15,644;That's what I say!
43;00:03:15,645;00:03:19,060;Yes!
44;00:03:22,936;00:03:26,810;I've gathered every Frey
44;00:03:22,936;00:03:26,810;who means a damn thing
45;00:03:26,811;00:03:32,143;so I can tell you my plans
45;00:03:26,811;00:03:32,143;for this great house
46;00:03:32,144;00:03:35,018;now that winter has come.
47;00:03:35,019;00:03:38,186;But first, a toast!
48;00:03:39,728;00:03:43,435;No more of that
48;00:03:39,728;00:03:43,435;Dornish horse piss!
49;00:03:43,436;00:03:46,393;This is the finest Arbor gold!
50;00:03:46,394;00:03:49,393;Proper wine for proper heroes!
51;00:03:54,561;00:03:56,769;Stand together!
52;00:03:56,770;00:03:59,019;Stand together!
53;00:04:07,770;00:04:09,185;Not you.
54;00:04:09,186;00:04:12,102;I'm not wasting good wine
54;00:04:09,186;00:04:12,102;on a damn woman.
55;00:04:15,770;00:04:20,143;Maybe I'm not
55;00:04:15,770;00:04:20,143;the most pleasant man.
56;00:04:20,144;00:04:23,560;I'll admit it.
56;00:04:20,144;00:04:23,560;But I'm proud of you lot.
57;00:04:23,561;00:04:26,685;You're my family,
57;00:04:23,561;00:04:26,685;the men who helped me
58;00:04:26,686;00:04:29,727;slaughter the Starks
58;00:04:26,686;00:04:29,727;at the Red Wedding.
59;00:04:29,728;00:04:33,851;Yes, yes.
60;00:04:33,852;00:04:36,519;Cheer.
61;00:04:36,520;00:04:39,851;Brave men, all of you.
62;00:04:39,852;00:04:43,435;Butchered a woman
62;00:04:39,852;00:04:43,435;pregnant with her babe.
63;00:04:43,436;00:04:49,268;Cut the throat
63;00:04:43,436;00:04:49,268;of a mother of five.
64;00:04:49,269;00:04:52,393;Slaughtered your guests
64;00:04:49,269;00:04:52,393;after inviting them
65;00:04:52,394;00:04:54,144;into your home.
66;00:04:55,811;00:05:01,435;But you didn't slaughter
66;00:04:55,811;00:05:01,435;every one of the Starks.
67;00:05:01,436;00:05:06,185;No, no, that was your mistake.
68;00:05:06,186;00:05:10,060;You should have ripped them
68;00:05:06,186;00:05:10,060;all out, root and stem.
69;00:05:16,603;00:05:18,935;Leave one wolf alive
70;00:05:18,936;00:05:21,603;and the sheep are never safe.
71;00:05:47,228;00:05:49,520;When people ask you
71;00:05:47,228;00:05:49,520;what happened here...
72;00:05:50,811;00:05:52,811;tell them the North remembers.
73;00:05:54,144;00:05:58,144;Tell them winter came
73;00:05:54,144;00:05:58,144;for House Frey.

124;00:13:24,061;00:13:25,685;should be torn down

126;00:13:27,436;00:13:30,018;The castles committed no crimes.
127;00:13:30,019;00:13:33,435;And we need every fortress

128;00:13:33,436;00:13:36,769;We should give the Last Hearth

129;00:13:36,770;00:13:39,310;loyal families who supported
129;00:13:36,770;00:13:39,310;us against Ramsay.
130;00:13:39,311;00:13:42,519;Aye!
131;00:13:42,520;00:13:44,810;The Umbers and the Karstarks
132;00:13:44,811;00:13:47,310;have fought beside

134;00:13:49,923;00:13:51,477;And then they broke faith.
135;00:13:51,478;00:13:54,560;I'm not going to strip these
135;00:13:51,478;00:13:54,560;families of their ancestral homes
136;00:13:54,561;00:13:57,143;because of the crimes
136;00:13:54,561;00:13:57,143;of a few reckless sons.
137;00:13:57,144;00:13:58,810;So there's no
137;00:13:57,144;00:13:58,810;punishment for treason
138;00:13:58,811;00:14:01,311;and no reward for loyalty?
139;00:14:06,478;00:14:09,143;The punishment
139;00:14:06,478;00:14:09,143;for treason is death.
140;00:14:09,144;00:14:11,976;Smalljon Umber died
140;00:14:09,144;00:14:11,976;on the field of battle.
141;00:14:11,977;00:14:14,810;Harald Karstark died
141;00:14:11,977;00:14:14,810;on the field of battle.
142;00:14:14,811;00:14:17,227;They died fighting for Ramsay.
143;00:14:17,228;00:14:18,810;Give the castles to the families
144;00:14:18,811;00:14:21,185;of the men who died
144;00:14:18,811;00:14:21,185;fighting for you.
145;00:14:34,394;00:14:37,311;When I was Lord Commander
145;00:14:34,394;00:14:37,311;of the Night's Watch...
146;00:14:38,811;00:14:41,143;I executed men who betrayed me.
147;00:14:41,144;00:14:45,393;I executed men who
147;00:14:41,144;00:14:45,393;refused to follow orders.
148;00:14:45,394;00:14:47,185;My father always said,
149;00:14:47,186;00:14:49,769;The man who passes the sentence
149;00:14:47,186;00:14:49,769;should swing the sword,
150;00:14:49,770;00:14:53,060;and I have tried
150;00:14:49,770;00:14:53,060;to live by those words.
151;00:14:53,061;00:14:56,519;But I will not punish a son
151;00:14:53,061;00:14:56,519;for his father's sins,
152;00:14:56,520;00:14:58,976;and I will not take
152;00:14:56,520;00:14:58,976;a family home away
153;00:14:58,977;00:15:02,352;from a family it has
153;00:14:58,977;00:15:02,352;belonged to for centuries.
154;00:15:02,353;00:15:04,935;That is my decision,
155;00:15:04,936;00:15:07,520;and my decision is final.
156;00:15:13,728;00:15:14,728;Ned Umber.
157;00:15:22,728;00:15:24,061;Alys Karstark.
158;00:15:39,019;00:15:40,893;For centuries,
158;00:15:39,019;00:15:40,893;our families fought
159;00:15:40,894;00:15:43,727;side by side on the battlefield.
160;00:15:43,728;00:15:48,727;I ask you to pledge your loyalty
160;00:15:43,728;00:15:48,727;once again to House Stark,
161;00:15:48,728;00:15:51,268;to serve as our bannermen
162;00:15:51,269;00:15:53,977;and come to our aid
162;00:15:51,269;00:15:53,977;whenever called upon.
163;00:16:02,770;00:16:03,894;Stand.
164;00:16:07,603;00:16:10,393;Yesterday's wars
164;00:16:07,603;00:16:10,393;don't matter anymore.
165;00:16:10,394;00:16:13,393;The North needs
165;00:16:10,394;00:16:13,393;to band together,
166;00:16:13,394;00:16:14,770;all the living north.
167;00:16:16,102;00:16:18,435;Will you stand beside me,
167;00:16:16,102;00:16:18,435;Ned and Alys,
168;00:16:18,436;00:16:20,685;now and always?
169;00:16:20,686;00:16:23,143;Now and always!
170;00:16:42,269;00:16:44,519;You are my sister,
170;00:16:42,269;00:16:44,519;but I am king now.
171;00:16:44,520;00:16:46,143;Will you start wearing a crown?
172;00:16:46,144;00:16:47,769;When you question my decisions
173;00:16:47,770;00:16:49,935;in front of the other lords
173;00:16:47,770;00:16:49,935;and ladies, you undermine me.
174;00:16:49,936;00:16:51,546;So I can't question
174;00:16:49,936;00:16:51,546;your decisions anymore?
175;00:16:51,548;00:16:52,644;Of course you can, but...
176;00:16:52,645;00:16:54,976;Joffrey never let anyone
176;00:16:52,645;00:16:54,976;question his authority.
177;00:16:54,977;00:16:56,977;You think he was a good king?
178;00:16:58,645;00:17:00,603;Do you think I'm Joffrey?
179;00:17:04,228;00:17:07,143;You're as far from Joffrey
179;00:17:04,228;00:17:07,143;as anyone I've ever met.
180;00:17:07,144;00:17:08,645;Thank you.
181;00:17:10,269;00:17:12,352;You're good at this, you know.
182;00:17:12,353;00:17:14,810;At what?
182;00:17:12,353;00:17:14,810;At ruling.
183;00:17:14,811;00:17:16,644;No.
184;00:17:16,645;00:17:17,645;You are.
185;00:17:18,686;00:17:20,144;You are.
186;00:17:21,561;00:17:23,935;They respect you,
186;00:17:21,561;00:17:23,935;they really do,
187;00:17:23,936;00:17:26,101;but you have to...
188;00:17:26,102;00:17:27,519;Why are you laughing?
189;00:17:27,520;00:17:29,685;What did father used to say?
190;00:17:29,686;00:17:33,018;Everything before the
190;00:17:29,686;00:17:33,018;word but is horse shit.
191;00:17:33,019;00:17:34,519;He never said that to me.
192;00:17:34,520;00:17:37,227;No. No, he never cursed
192;00:17:34,520;00:17:37,227;in front of his girls.
193;00:17:37,228;00:17:40,310;Because he was
193;00:17:37,228;00:17:40,310;trying to protect us.
194;00:17:40,311;00:17:43,310;He never wanted us to see
194;00:17:40,311;00:17:43,310;how dirty the world really is,
195;00:17:43,311;00:17:46,018;but Father couldn't protect
195;00:17:43,311;00:17:46,018;me and neither can you.
196;00:17:46,019;00:17:47,304;Stop trying.
197;00:17:47,305;00:17:48,727;All right, I'll stop
197;00:17:47,305;00:17:48,727;trying to protect you
198;00:17:48,728;00:17:50,101;and you stop trying
198;00:17:48,728;00:17:50,101;to undermine me.
199;00:17:50,102;00:17:52,311;I'm not trying to undermine you!
200;00:17:53,852;00:17:56,893;You have to be
200;00:17:53,852;00:17:56,893;smarter than Father.
201;00:17:56,894;00:17:59,560;You need to be
201;00:17:56,894;00:17:59,560;smarter than Robb.
202;00:17:59,561;00:18:02,685;I loved them, I miss them,
202;00:17:59,561;00:18:02,685;but they made stupid mistakes,
203;00:18:02,686;00:18:04,727;and they both
203;00:18:02,686;00:18:04,727;lost their heads for it.
204;00:18:04,728;00:18:06,935;And how should I be smarter?
205;00:18:06,936;00:18:08,394;By listening to you?
206;00:18:10,520;00:18:13,727;Would that be so terrible?
207;00:18:13,728;00:18:16,686;A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace.
208;00:18:25,686;00:18:28,727;Cersei of House Lannister,
208;00:18:25,686;00:18:28,727;First of Her Name,
209;00:18:28,728;00:18:30,644;Queen of the Andals
209;00:18:28,728;00:18:30,644;and the First Men,
210;00:18:30,645;00:18:32,268;Protector of
210;00:18:30,645;00:18:32,268;the Seven Kingdoms...
211;00:18:32,269;00:18:33,728;What does she want?
212;00:18:34,977;00:18:37,769;Come to King's Landing.
213;00:18:37,770;00:18:41,602;Bend the knee or suffer
213;00:18:37,770;00:18:41,602;the fate of all traitors.
214;00:18:41,603;00:18:43,727;You've been so consumed
214;00:18:41,603;00:18:43,727;with the enemy to the north,
215;00:18:43,728;00:18:45,560;you've forgotten about
215;00:18:43,728;00:18:45,560;the one to the south.
216;00:18:45,561;00:18:48,602;I'm consumed with the Night
216;00:18:45,561;00:18:48,602;King because I've seen him.
217;00:18:48,603;00:18:51,227;And believe me, you'd think
217;00:18:48,603;00:18:51,227;of little else if you had, too.
218;00:18:51,228;00:18:52,935;We still have a wall between
218;00:18:51,228;00:18:52,935;us and the Night King.
219;00:18:52,936;00:18:54,769;There's nothing
219;00:18:52,936;00:18:54,769;between us and Cersei.
220;00:18:54,770;00:18:57,685;There's a thousand miles
220;00:18:54,770;00:18:57,685;between us and Cersei.
221;00:18:57,686;00:19:00,477;Winter is here. The Lannisters
221;00:18:57,686;00:19:00,477;are a southern army.
222;00:19:00,478;00:19:01,935;They've never ranged
222;00:19:00,478;00:19:01,935;this far north.
223;00:19:01,936;00:19:05,268;You're the military man,
223;00:19:01,936;00:19:05,268;but I know her.
224;00:19:05,269;00:19:08,602;If you're her enemy, she'll never
224;00:19:05,269;00:19:08,602;stop until she's destroyed you.
225;00:19:08,603;00:19:11,770;Everyone who's ever crossed her,
225;00:19:08,603;00:19:11,770;she's found a way to murder.
226;00:19:14,852;00:19:16,936;You almost sound
226;00:19:14,852;00:19:16,936;as if you admire her.
227;00:19:20,561;00:19:22,770;I learned a great deal from her.
228;00:19:59,645;00:20:01,477;What is this?
229;00:20:01,478;00:20:04,143;It's what we've been
229;00:20:01,478;00:20:04,143;waiting for our whole lives.
230;00:20:04,144;00:20:06,935;It's what Father trained us for,
230;00:20:04,144;00:20:06,935;whether he knew it or not.
231;00:20:06,936;00:20:08,435;He knew it.
232;00:20:08,436;00:20:10,393;Made me memorize
232;00:20:08,436;00:20:10,393;every damn city, town,
233;00:20:10,394;00:20:11,976;lake, forest, and mountain.
234;00:20:11,977;00:20:14,144;It's ours now.
234;00:20:11,977;00:20:14,144;We just have to take it.
235;00:20:15,686;00:20:18,018;You've been quiet
235;00:20:15,686;00:20:18,018;since you came home.
236;00:20:18,019;00:20:19,477;Are you angry with me?
237;00:20:19,478;00:20:21,728;No, not angry.
238;00:20:22,852;00:20:23,852;Are you afraid of me?
239;00:20:25,852;00:20:26,977;Should I be?
240;00:20:30,770;00:20:34,685;Daenerys Targaryen has chosen
240;00:20:30,770;00:20:34,685;Tyrion to be her Hand.
241;00:20:34,686;00:20:37,477;Right now, they're sailing
241;00:20:34,686;00:20:37,477;across the Narrow Sea,
242;00:20:37,478;00:20:40,477;hoping to take back
242;00:20:37,478;00:20:40,477;her father's throne.
243;00:20:40,478;00:20:42,893;Our little brother,
244;00:20:42,894;00:20:45,060;the one you love so much,
245;00:20:45,061;00:20:46,893;the one you set free,
246;00:20:46,894;00:20:50,185;the one who murdered our
246;00:20:46,894;00:20:50,185;father and our first-born son,
247;00:20:50,186;00:20:53,520;now he stands beside our enemies
247;00:20:50,186;00:20:53,520;and gives them counsel.
248;00:20:57,228;00:21:01,227;He's out there somewhere
248;00:20:57,228;00:21:01,227;at the head of an armada.
249;00:21:01,228;00:21:02,936;Where will they land?
250;00:21:05,728;00:21:07,060;Dragonstone.
251;00:21:07,061;00:21:09,851;They have deep-water
251;00:21:07,061;00:21:09,851;ports for the ships.
252;00:21:09,852;00:21:11,851;Stannis left
252;00:21:09,852;00:21:11,851;the castle unoccupied,
253;00:21:11,852;00:21:13,310;and that's where she was born.
254;00:21:13,311;00:21:15,602;Enemies to the east.
255;00:21:15,603;00:21:17,393;Enemies to the south...
256;00:21:17,394;00:21:20,393;Ellaria Sand
256;00:21:17,394;00:21:20,393;and her brood of bitches.
257;00:21:20,394;00:21:22,227;Enemies to the west...
258;00:21:22,228;00:21:24,060;Olenna, the old cunt.
259;00:21:24,061;00:21:27,268;Another traitor.
260;00:21:27,269;00:21:29,435;Enemies to the north.
261;00:21:29,436;00:21:32,560;Ned Stark's bastard has been
261;00:21:29,436;00:21:32,560;named King in the North
262;00:21:32,561;00:21:35,560;and that murdering whore
262;00:21:32,561;00:21:35,560;Sansa stands beside him.
263;00:21:35,561;00:21:38,227;Enemies everywhere.
263;00:21:35,561;00:21:38,227;We're surrounded by traitors.
264;00:21:38,228;00:21:39,935;You're in command
264;00:21:38,228;00:21:39,935;of the Lannister army now.
265;00:21:39,936;00:21:43,060;How do we proceed?
265;00:21:39,936;00:21:43,060;Winter is here.
266;00:21:43,061;00:21:46,352;We can't win a war if we can't
266;00:21:43,061;00:21:46,352;feed our men and our horses.
267;00:21:46,353;00:21:50,519;The Tyrells have the grain,
267;00:21:46,353;00:21:50,519;the Tyrells have the livestock.
268;00:21:50,520;00:21:52,560;Will the Tyrell bannermen
268;00:21:50,520;00:21:52,560;stand alongside
269;00:21:52,561;00:21:55,851;a Dothraki horde
269;00:21:52,561;00:21:55,851;and Unsullied slave soldiers?
270;00:21:55,852;00:21:58,519;If they think Daenerys will win.
271;00:21:58,520;00:22:00,477;No one wants to fight
271;00:21:58,520;00:22:00,477;on the losing side.
272;00:22:00,478;00:22:03,603;Right now, we look like the losing side.
273;00:22:04,894;00:22:06,727;I'm the Queen
273;00:22:04,894;00:22:06,727;of the Seven Kingdoms.
274;00:22:06,728;00:22:09,477;Three kingdoms, at best.
275;00:22:09,478;00:22:12,018;I'm not sure you understand
275;00:22:09,478;00:22:12,018;how much danger we're in.
276;00:22:12,019;00:22:13,810;I understand we're
276;00:22:12,019;00:22:13,810;in a war for survival.
277;00:22:13,811;00:22:16,851;I understand whoever loses dies.
278;00:22:16,852;00:22:19,143;I understand whoever wins
278;00:22:16,852;00:22:19,143;could launch a dynasty
279;00:22:19,144;00:22:20,727;that lasts a thousand years.
280;00:22:20,728;00:22:23,310;A dynasty for whom?
281;00:22:23,311;00:22:26,310;Our children are dead.
282;00:22:26,311;00:22:27,769;We're the last of us.
283;00:22:27,770;00:22:29,811;A dynasty for us, then.
284;00:22:32,977;00:22:34,520;We never talked about Tommen.
285;00:22:37,520;00:22:39,477;There's nothing to say.
286;00:22:39,478;00:22:41,435;Our baby boy killed himself.
287;00:22:41,436;00:22:42,976;He betrayed me.
288;00:22:42,977;00:22:44,477;He betrayed us both.
289;00:22:44,478;00:22:46,310;Should we spend our days
289;00:22:44,478;00:22:46,310;mourning the dead...
290;00:22:46,311;00:22:47,727;Mother, father,
290;00:22:46,311;00:22:47,727;and all our children?
291;00:22:47,728;00:22:50,310;Cersei...
291;00:22:47,728;00:22:50,310;I loved them. I did.
292;00:22:50,311;00:22:53,519;But they're ashes now and
292;00:22:50,311;00:22:53,519;we're still flesh and blood.
293;00:22:53,520;00:22:56,520;We're the last Lannisters,
293;00:22:53,520;00:22:56,520;the last ones who count.
294;00:23:02,353;00:23:05,018;Even Lannisters can't
294;00:23:02,353;00:23:05,018;survive without allies.
295;00:23:05,019;00:23:08,185;Where are our allies now?
296;00:23:08,186;00:23:10,393;You saw what happened to
296;00:23:08,186;00:23:10,393;Walder Frey and his family.
297;00:23:10,394;00:23:12,060;I heard.
298;00:23:12,061;00:23:14,602;How could we ever trust a man like that?
298;00:23:12,061;00:23:14,602;We couldn't.
299;00:23:14,603;00:23:16,602;He was a useless, old coward,
300;00:23:16,603;00:23:18,435;but the Freys supported us.
301;00:23:18,436;00:23:19,810;Now they're all dead.
302;00:23:19,811;00:23:21,519;Whoever killed them
302;00:23:19,811;00:23:21,519;is no friend of ours.
303;00:23:21,520;00:23:23,060;We need allies.
304;00:23:23,061;00:23:24,851;Stronger, better allies.
305;00:23:24,852;00:23:26,977;We can't win this war alone.
306;00:23:28,977;00:23:32,603;You think I listened to Father for
306;00:23:28,977;00:23:32,603;40 years and learned nothing?
307;00:24:09,603;00:24:11,101;The Greyjoys?
308;00:24:11,102;00:24:13,685;You invited the Greyjoys
308;00:24:11,102;00:24:13,685;to King's Landing?
309;00:24:13,686;00:24:16,519;Not all of them.
309;00:24:13,686;00:24:16,519;Well, it looks like all of them.
310;00:24:16,520;00:24:18,101;I invited Euron Greyjoy,
311;00:24:18,102;00:24:20,602;the new King
311;00:24:18,102;00:24:20,602;of the Iron Islands.
312;00:24:20,603;00:24:23,310;You said yourself we needed
312;00:24:20,603;00:24:23,310;stronger, better allies.
313;00:24:23,311;00:24:26,435;There you are.
313;00:24:23,311;00:24:26,435;How are they better allies?
314;00:24:26,436;00:24:28,851;How are they different
314;00:24:26,436;00:24:28,851;from the Freys?
315;00:24:28,852;00:24:30,435;They both broke their promises
316;00:24:30,436;00:24:32,727;and murdered their former friends
316;00:24:30,436;00:24:32,727;as soon as it suited them.
317;00:24:32,728;00:24:35,727;So does everyone
317;00:24:32,728;00:24:35,727;when it suits them.
318;00:24:35,728;00:24:38,352;Unlike the Freys,
318;00:24:35,728;00:24:38,352;they have ships.
319;00:24:38,353;00:24:40,976;And they're good at killing.
319;00:24:38,353;00:24:40,976;They're not good at anything.
320;00:24:40,977;00:24:44,393;I know the ironborn. They're
320;00:24:40,977;00:24:44,393;bitter, angry little people.
321;00:24:44,394;00:24:47,602;All they know how to do is steal things
321;00:24:44,394;00:24:47,602;they can't build or grow themselves.
322;00:24:47,603;00:24:49,727;Euron Greyjoy didn't
322;00:24:47,603;00:24:49,727;come here for that.
323;00:24:49,728;00:24:51,769;Oh, what did
323;00:24:49,728;00:24:51,769;he come here for, then?
324;00:24:51,770;00:24:53,436;A queen.
325;00:25:06,144;00:25:09,352;The moment I was chosen
325;00:25:06,144;00:25:09,352;Lord of the Iron Islands,
326;00:25:09,353;00:25:11,727;they turned on me.
327;00:25:11,728;00:25:12,976;Their own uncle.
328;00:25:12,977;00:25:15,602;They stole
328;00:25:12,977;00:25:15,602;my best ships and ran.
329;00:25:15,603;00:25:17,769;Sailed them
329;00:25:15,603;00:25:17,769;right across the world
330;00:25:17,770;00:25:20,060;and gave them
330;00:25:17,770;00:25:20,060;to the Dragon Queen
331;00:25:20,061;00:25:23,519;so she could bring her
331;00:25:20,061;00:25:23,519;armies here to attack you.
332;00:25:23,520;00:25:26,976;It's nothing compared
332;00:25:23,520;00:25:26,976;to the treason you suffered
333;00:25:26,977;00:25:30,644;at the hands of a family
333;00:25:26,977;00:25:30,644;member, from what I hear.
334;00:25:30,645;00:25:33,353;But still, it bothers me.
335;00:25:34,977;00:25:38,018;Murdering them would
335;00:25:34,977;00:25:38,018;make me feel a lot better.
336;00:25:38,019;00:25:42,185;And since it appears that all
336;00:25:38,019;00:25:42,185;our treasonous family members
337;00:25:42,186;00:25:44,101;are fighting for the same side,
338;00:25:44,102;00:25:46,644;I thought we rightful monarchs
339;00:25:46,645;00:25:49,228;could murder them together.
340;00:25:55,228;00:25:58,019;You're not a rightful
340;00:25:55,228;00:25:58,019;monarch, though, are you?
341;00:26:02,144;00:26:05,143;The Greyjoys rebelled against the
341;00:26:02,144;00:26:05,143;throne for the right to be monarchs,
342;00:26:05,144;00:26:09,185;but as I recall,
342;00:26:05,144;00:26:09,185;you were soundly defeated.
343;00:26:09,186;00:26:11,018;Come to mention it,
344;00:26:11,019;00:26:13,393;weren't you the one
344;00:26:11,019;00:26:13,393;who started that rebellion
345;00:26:13,394;00:26:17,602;by sailing to Casterly Rock
345;00:26:13,394;00:26:17,602;and burning the Lannister fleet?
346;00:26:17,603;00:26:19,310;You certainly caught us there.
347;00:26:19,311;00:26:22,143;Very smart move on your part.
348;00:26:22,144;00:26:26,393;Of course, we all made it
348;00:26:22,144;00:26:26,393;to the Iron Islands anyway.
349;00:26:26,394;00:26:27,602;I was there.
350;00:26:27,603;00:26:29,435;I remember very well.
351;00:26:29,436;00:26:30,976;I saw you.
352;00:26:30,977;00:26:33,268;I heard so much talk.
353;00:26:33,269;00:26:36,893;The best in the world.
353;00:26:33,269;00:26:36,893;No one can stop him.
354;00:26:36,894;00:26:38,602;I didn't believe it,
354;00:26:36,894;00:26:38,602;to be honest.
355;00:26:38,603;00:26:41,893;But I must say when you
355;00:26:38,603;00:26:41,893;rushed through the breach
356;00:26:41,894;00:26:44,061;and started
356;00:26:41,894;00:26:44,061;cutting people down...
357;00:26:47,561;00:26:49,268;it was glorious.
358;00:26:49,269;00:26:50,685;Like a dance.
359;00:26:50,686;00:26:53,893;The people I was cutting
359;00:26:50,686;00:26:53,893;down were your own kin.
360;00:26:53,894;00:26:56,227;The place was getting crowded.
361;00:26:56,228;00:26:58,810;I enjoyed watching it.
361;00:26:56,228;00:26:58,810;I truly did.
362;00:26:58,811;00:27:01,018;And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
363;00:27:01,019;00:27:03,477;A good thing for me.
364;00:27:03,478;00:27:07,101;If you hadn't crushed us, I
364;00:27:03,478;00:27:07,101;wouldn't have gone into exile.
365;00:27:07,102;00:27:09,018;If I hadn't done that,
366;00:27:09,019;00:27:12,603;I wouldn't be the greatest
366;00:27:09,019;00:27:12,603;captain on the 14 seas.
367;00:27:13,645;00:27:15,478;If not the most humble.
368;00:27:16,770;00:27:17,770;You're not humble.
369;00:27:19,728;00:27:21,728;You're the queen
369;00:27:19,728;00:27:21,728;of a great nation.
370;00:27:23,019;00:27:24,685;You don't care about
370;00:27:23,019;00:27:24,685;the Iron Islands.
371;00:27:24,686;00:27:29,352;They're nothing but rocks
371;00:27:24,686;00:27:29,352;and bird shit and...
372;00:27:29,353;00:27:32,227;And a lot of very
372;00:27:29,353;00:27:32,227;unattractive people.
373;00:27:32,228;00:27:34,851;The Iron Fleet,
373;00:27:32,228;00:27:34,851;on the other hand,
374;00:27:34,852;00:27:37,976;that's something else entirely.
375;00:27:37,977;00:27:41,268;It's the greatest armada
375;00:27:37,977;00:27:41,268;Westeros has ever seen.
376;00:27:41,269;00:27:45,851;With the Iron Fleet,
376;00:27:41,269;00:27:45,851;you own the seas.
377;00:27:45,852;00:27:48,685;You can defeat
377;00:27:45,852;00:27:48,685;the invaders of the east
378;00:27:48,686;00:27:51,644;and the pretenders
378;00:27:48,686;00:27:51,644;of the north and south.
379;00:27:51,645;00:27:53,269;What do you want in return?
380;00:27:55,353;00:27:58,393;Ever since I was a little boy,
381;00:27:58,394;00:28:00,310;I wanted to grow up and marry
382;00:28:00,311;00:28:02,435;the most beautiful woman
382;00:28:00,311;00:28:02,435;in the world.
383;00:28:02,436;00:28:05,143;So here I am,
384;00:28:05,144;00:28:07,602;with a thousand ships
385;00:28:07,603;00:28:09,144;and two good hands.
386;00:28:14,561;00:28:16,144;I decline your proposal.
387;00:28:18,645;00:28:19,685;Why?
388;00:28:19,686;00:28:21,353;You're not trustworthy.
389;00:28:22,770;00:28:24,851;You've broken promises
389;00:28:22,770;00:28:24,851;to allies before
390;00:28:24,852;00:28:27,310;and murdered them
390;00:28:24,852;00:28:27,310;at the nearest opportunity.
391;00:28:27,311;00:28:28,852;You murdered your own brother.
392;00:28:30,186;00:28:32,519;You should try it.
392;00:28:30,186;00:28:32,519;Feels wonderful.
393;00:28:34,144;00:28:36,185;I don't expect you
393;00:28:34,144;00:28:36,185;to trust me outright.
394;00:28:36,186;00:28:38,560;You need proof
394;00:28:36,186;00:28:38,560;of my honest intentions.
395;00:28:38,561;00:28:40,018;In my experience,
396;00:28:40,019;00:28:43,018;the surest way to a woman's
396;00:28:40,019;00:28:43,018;heart is with a gift.
397;00:28:43,019;00:28:45,310;A priceless gift.
398;00:28:45,311;00:28:47,185;I won't return to King's Landing
399;00:28:47,186;00:28:49,228;until I have that for you.
400;00:31:55,228;00:31:58,060;Ah, Maester Weyland.
401;00:31:58,061;00:32:01,561;A drinker's
401;00:31:58,061;00:32:01,561;liver if ever I saw one.
402;00:32:02,811;00:32:03,811;Weigh that.
403;00:32:04,977;00:32:08,268;The triumph
403;00:32:04,977;00:32:08,268;of transitory pleasures.
404;00:32:08,269;00:32:10,185;Mankind's curse.
405;00:32:10,186;00:32:13,268;Archmaester, I was wondering...
406;00:32:13,269;00:32:15,227;What's the weight?
407;00:32:15,228;00:32:18,186;Um, 147.
408;00:32:21,102;00:32:24,185;I was wondering if you had
408;00:32:21,102;00:32:24,185;considered my proposition.
409;00:32:24,186;00:32:27,268;I don't remember
409;00:32:24,186;00:32:27,268;your proposition.
410;00:32:27,269;00:32:30,560;I asked you if, in light of
410;00:32:27,269;00:32:30,560;what I've seen in the North,
411;00:32:30,561;00:32:33,727;if I could have access to the
411;00:32:30,561;00:32:33,727;restricted area of the library.
412;00:32:33,728;00:32:35,435;That area is reserved
412;00:32:33,728;00:32:35,435;for maesters.
413;00:32:35,436;00:32:37,935;Are you a maester?
413;00:32:35,436;00:32:37,935;No.
414;00:32:37,936;00:32:40,061;Not a very strong
414;00:32:37,936;00:32:40,061;proposition, is it?
415;00:32:49,353;00:32:52,018;Archmaester, with respect,
416;00:32:52,019;00:32:53,851;I've seen them...
417;00:32:53,852;00:32:56,101;The Army of the Dead.
418;00:32:56,102;00:32:58,477;The white walkers.
419;00:32:58,478;00:33:00,976;I was sent here to learn
419;00:32:58,478;00:33:00,976;how to defeat them,
420;00:33:00,977;00:33:03,519;but everyone in the Citadel,
421;00:33:03,520;00:33:05,685;those who will even talk to me,
422;00:33:05,686;00:33:08,519;they all doubt the walkers ever
422;00:33:05,686;00:33:08,519;existed in the first place.
423;00:33:08,520;00:33:11,060;Everyone in the Citadel
423;00:33:08,520;00:33:11,060;doubts everything.
424;00:33:11,061;00:33:12,144;It's their job.
425;00:33:17,686;00:33:20,977;But the tales of the Long Night
425;00:33:17,686;00:33:20,977;can't be pure fabrication.
426;00:33:22,811;00:33:25,727;Too many similarities
426;00:33:22,811;00:33:25,727;from unconnected sources.
427;00:33:25,728;00:33:28,310;Sources in the restricted area?
428;00:33:28,311;00:33:29,936;The very same.
429;00:33:31,228;00:33:32,685;And the simplest explanation
430;00:33:32,686;00:33:35,644;for your grating obsession
430;00:33:32,686;00:33:35,644;with the white walkers
431;00:33:35,645;00:33:37,143;is that you're telling the truth
432;00:33:37,144;00:33:40,268;and that you saw
432;00:33:37,144;00:33:40,268;what you say you saw.
433;00:33:40,269;00:33:43,144;So, you believe me.
434;00:33:44,311;00:33:45,976;I do.
435;00:33:45,977;00:33:47,686;You'll finish
435;00:33:45,977;00:33:47,686;weighing that heart?
436;00:33:49,977;00:33:52,811;That makes you the only person
436;00:33:49,977;00:33:52,811;south of the Twins who does.
437;00:33:55,852;00:33:58,685;We're not like the people
437;00:33:55,852;00:33:58,685;south of the Twins.
438;00:33:58,686;00:34:00,894;And we're not like the
438;00:33:58,686;00:34:00,894;people north of the Twins.
439;00:34:03,228;00:34:07,144;In the Citadel, we lead different
439;00:34:03,228;00:34:07,144;lives for different reasons.
440;00:34:09,019;00:34:11,810;We are this world's memory,
440;00:34:09,019;00:34:11,810;Samwell Tarly.
441;00:34:11,811;00:34:14,769;Without us, men would be
441;00:34:11,811;00:34:14,769;little better than dogs.
442;00:34:14,770;00:34:16,935;Don't remember
442;00:34:14,770;00:34:16,935;any meal but the last,
443;00:34:16,936;00:34:19,602;can't see forward
443;00:34:16,936;00:34:19,602;to any but the next.
444;00:34:19,603;00:34:21,769;And every time you leave the
444;00:34:19,603;00:34:21,769;house and shut the door,
445;00:34:21,770;00:34:24,685;they howl like
445;00:34:21,770;00:34:24,685;you're gone forever.
446;00:34:24,686;00:34:27,685;When Robert's Rebellion
446;00:34:24,686;00:34:27,685;was raging,
447;00:34:27,686;00:34:29,519;people thought the end was near.
448;00:34:29,520;00:34:32,602;The end of the Targaryen dynasty.
448;00:34:29,520;00:34:32,602;How will we survive?
449;00:34:32,603;00:34:36,060;When Aegon Targaryen
449;00:34:32,603;00:34:36,060;turned his eye westward
450;00:34:36,061;00:34:38,018;and flew his dragons
450;00:34:36,061;00:34:38,018;to Blackwater Rush...
451;00:34:38,019;00:34:40,060;The end is near!
451;00:34:38,019;00:34:40,060;How will we survive?
452;00:34:40,061;00:34:42,935;And thousands of years before
452;00:34:40,061;00:34:42,935;that, during the Long Night,
453;00:34:42,936;00:34:45,060;we can forgive them for
453;00:34:42,936;00:34:45,060;thinking it truly was the end.
454;00:34:45,061;00:34:47,770;But it wasn't.
454;00:34:45,061;00:34:47,770;None of it was.
455;00:34:49,561;00:34:52,102;The Wall has stood
455;00:34:49,561;00:34:52,102;through it all.
456;00:34:53,394;00:34:56,353;And every winter
456;00:34:53,394;00:34:56,353;that ever came has ended.
457;00:35:04,561;00:35:06,728;Be a good lad.
457;00:35:04,561;00:35:06,728;Clean this up.
458;00:35:56,520;00:35:58,228;Nope.
459;00:36:09,311;00:36:10,353;Nope.
460;00:36:22,770;00:36:24,811;You're a lucky man.

464;00:36:45,353;00:36:47,352;I want you to be happy.

467;00:36:51,019;00:36:54,185;I'm at home,

469;00:37:01,436;00:37:03,228;What about happy?
470;00:37:05,894;00:37:07,727;Why aren't you happy?

474;00:37:20,728;00:37:23,102;I'll assume it was
474;00:37:20,728;00:37:23,102;something clever.

529;00:40:47,228;00:40:49,560;But now we've been gone a while,
529;00:40:47,228;00:40:49,560;we can't wait to get home.
530;00:40:49,561;00:40:53,602;I just think about my dad out
530;00:40:49,561;00:40:53,602;there on his boat all alone.
531;00:40:53,603;00:40:54,977;I ought to be
531;00:40:53,603;00:40:54,977;out there with him.
532;00:40:57,102;00:40:58,935;My wife just had our first baby.
533;00:40:58,936;00:41:01,227;Boy or girl?
533;00:40:58,936;00:41:01,227;Oh, who knows?
534;00:41:01,228;00:41:03,393;You think soldiers get
534;00:41:01,228;00:41:03,393;ravens with news from home?
535;00:41:07,186;00:41:09,851;I hope it's a girl.
535;00:41:07,186;00:41:09,851;Why?
536;00:41:09,852;00:41:12,810;Girls take care of their papas
536;00:41:09,852;00:41:12,810;when their papas grow old.
537;00:41:12,811;00:41:14,811;Boys just go off to fight
537;00:41:12,811;00:41:14,811;in someone else's wars.
538;00:41:17,645;00:41:19,394;Are you old enough to drink?
539;00:41:34,852;00:41:36,727;It's blackberry wine.
540;00:41:36,728;00:41:38,019;I made it myself.
541;00:41:39,478;00:41:40,603;It's really good.
542;00:41:42,728;00:41:46,102;So, why is a nice girl on her
542;00:41:42,728;00:41:46,102;own heading to King's Landing?
543;00:41:53,645;00:41:55,645;I'm going to kill the queen.
544;00:42:17,102;00:42:19,018;Bad night to be outdoors.
545;00:42:19,019;00:42:21,851;You've got real
545;00:42:19,019;00:42:21,851;powerful magic to figure that out.
546;00:42:21,852;00:42:25,935;Did the Lord of Light
546;00:42:21,852;00:42:25,935;whisper that in your ear?
547;00:42:25,936;00:42:29,101;It's snowing, Thoros.
547;00:42:25,936;00:42:29,101;It's windy.
548;00:42:29,102;00:42:32,060;It's gonna be
548;00:42:29,102;00:42:32,060;a cold night.
549;00:42:32,061;00:42:35,935;You're a grouchy old bear,
549;00:42:32,061;00:42:35,935;aren't you, Clegane?
550;00:42:35,936;00:42:37,602;You want some rum?
551;00:42:37,603;00:42:40,685;Don't like that shit.
551;00:42:37,603;00:42:40,685;It's too sweet.
552;00:42:40,686;00:42:42,728;Why are you always
552;00:42:40,686;00:42:42,728;in such a foul mood?
553;00:42:44,894;00:42:47,019;Experience.
554;00:42:51,186;00:42:53,478;This seems like a good
554;00:42:51,186;00:42:53,478;place to spend the night.
555;00:42:56,144;00:42:58,560;These people don't want us here.
556;00:42:58,561;00:43:01,477;Seems deserted to me.
556;00:42:58,561;00:43:01,477;No livestock.
557;00:43:01,478;00:43:03,436;No smoke coming
557;00:43:01,478;00:43:03,436;from the chimney.
558;00:43:22,977;00:43:24,393;I don't like the look of it.
559;00:43:24,394;00:43:27,393;For a big, hard man,
559;00:43:24,394;00:43:27,393;you scare easy.
560;00:43:27,394;00:43:30,018;I'll tell you
560;00:43:27,394;00:43:30,018;what doesn't scare me...
561;00:43:30,019;00:43:32,018;Bald cocksuckers like you.
562;00:43:32,019;00:43:34,893;You think you're fooling
562;00:43:32,019;00:43:34,893;anyone with that top knot?
563;00:43:34,894;00:43:36,686;Bald cunt.
564;00:43:38,770;00:43:40,310;Come on.
565;00:43:40,311;00:43:42,144;Maybe they've got
565;00:43:40,311;00:43:42,144;some ale hidden away.
566;00:43:43,811;00:43:45,268;They don't.
567;00:43:48,186;00:43:49,851;See if there's a larder.
568;00:43:49,852;00:43:51,561;They always leave
568;00:43:49,852;00:43:51,561;something behind.
569;00:44:33,228;00:44:34,588;How do you think
569;00:44:33,228;00:44:34,588;it ended for them?
570;00:44:36,144;00:44:37,352;With death.
571;00:44:37,353;00:44:40,310;Girl died in her father's arms.
572;00:44:40,311;00:44:43,144;Both of them covered in blood
572;00:44:40,311;00:44:43,144;and a knife at their feet.
573;00:44:45,645;00:44:47,268;I'd say they were starving.
574;00:44:47,269;00:44:49,185;And rather than
574;00:44:47,269;00:44:49,185;let his little girl suffer,
575;00:44:49,186;00:44:51,143;he ended it for both of them.
576;00:44:51,144;00:44:53,393;Doesn't matter now.
577;00:44:53,394;00:44:56,186;No, doesn't matter now.
578;00:45:09,936;00:45:12,352;I've known you
578;00:45:09,936;00:45:12,352;a long time, Dondarrion.
579;00:45:12,353;00:45:13,851;Aye.
580;00:45:13,852;00:45:17,935;I think the first time we met
580;00:45:13,852;00:45:17,935;was at that tournament...
581;00:45:17,936;00:45:21,185;And I always thought
581;00:45:17,936;00:45:21,185;you were dull as dirt.
582;00:45:22,520;00:45:24,268;You're not bad.
583;00:45:24,269;00:45:25,644;I don't hate you.
584;00:45:25,645;00:45:28,018;Don't like you,
584;00:45:25,645;00:45:28,018;but you're not bad.
585;00:45:28,019;00:45:29,851;Thank you, Clegane.
586;00:45:29,852;00:45:31,185;That warms the heart.
587;00:45:31,186;00:45:33,851;But there's nothing
587;00:45:31,186;00:45:33,851;special about you.
588;00:45:33,852;00:45:35,685;You're right about that.
589;00:45:35,686;00:45:39,144;So why does the Lord of Light
589;00:45:35,686;00:45:39,144;keep bringing you back?
590;00:45:40,436;00:45:42,519;I've met better men than you,
591;00:45:42,520;00:45:47,435;and they've been hanged from
591;00:45:42,520;00:45:47,435;crossbeams, or beheaded,
592;00:45:47,436;00:45:52,310;or just shat themselves to
592;00:45:47,436;00:45:52,310;death in a field somewhere.
593;00:45:52,311;00:45:55,393;None of them came back.
594;00:45:55,394;00:45:56,976;So, why you?
595;00:45:56,977;00:45:59,893;You think I don't
595;00:45:56,977;00:45:59,893;ask myself that?
596;00:45:59,894;00:46:03,060;Every hour of every day?
597;00:46:03,061;00:46:04,728;Why am I here?
598;00:46:06,102;00:46:07,893;What am I supposed to do?
599;00:46:07,894;00:46:09,686;What does the Lord see in me?
600;00:46:11,686;00:46:13,019;And?
601;00:46:14,728;00:46:17,393;I don't know.
602;00:46:17,394;00:46:19,393;I don't understand our Lord.
603;00:46:19,394;00:46:21,227;Your Lord.
604;00:46:21,228;00:46:23,018;I don't know
604;00:46:21,228;00:46:23,018;what He wants from me.
605;00:46:23,019;00:46:27,519;I only know that
605;00:46:23,019;00:46:27,519;He wants me alive.
606;00:46:27,520;00:46:31,811;If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he
606;00:46:27,520;00:46:31,811;just tell you what the fuck he wants?
607;00:46:33,894;00:46:35,685;Clegane.
608;00:46:35,686;00:46:37,061;Come over here.
609;00:46:39,728;00:46:41,436;Don't worry.
609;00:46:39,728;00:46:41,436;The fire won't bite.
610;00:46:42,936;00:46:45,727;I want to show you something.
611;00:46:45,728;00:46:48,936;It's my fucking luck I end up
611;00:46:45,728;00:46:48,936;with a band of fire worshippers.
612;00:46:50,102;00:46:51,435;Aye.
613;00:46:51,436;00:46:53,769;Almost seems like
613;00:46:51,436;00:46:53,769;divine justice.
614;00:46:53,770;00:46:56,310;There's no divine justice,
614;00:46:53,770;00:46:56,310;you dumb cunt.
615;00:46:56,311;00:46:59,435;If there was, you'd be dead...
616;00:46:59,436;00:47:01,603;and that girl would be alive.
617;00:47:07,977;00:47:10,810;What do you want?
617;00:47:07,977;00:47:10,810;Look into the flames.
618;00:47:10,811;00:47:12,935;I don't want to look
618;00:47:10,811;00:47:12,935;in the damn flames.
619;00:47:12,936;00:47:16,478;You saw me bring him back from
619;00:47:12,936;00:47:16,478;the dead after you cut him down.
620;00:47:18,102;00:47:20,352;Don't you want to know
620;00:47:18,102;00:47:20,352;what gave me the power?
621;00:47:20,353;00:47:23,810;I keep asking and no
621;00:47:20,353;00:47:23,810;one wants to tell me.
622;00:47:23,811;00:47:25,310;We can't tell you.
623;00:47:25,311;00:47:27,478;Only the fire can tell you.
624;00:47:40,061;00:47:41,520;What do you see?
625;00:47:43,269;00:47:44,727;Logs burning.
626;00:47:44,728;00:47:46,811;Keep looking.
627;00:47:52,478;00:47:53,686;What do you see?
628;00:48:03,186;00:48:05,893;Ice.
629;00:48:05,894;00:48:07,811;A wall of ice.
630;00:48:10,228;00:48:11,228;The Wall.
631;00:48:14,019;00:48:15,268;What else?
632;00:48:15,269;00:48:19,478;It's where the Wall
632;00:48:15,269;00:48:19,478;meets the sea.
633;00:48:20,686;00:48:22,894;There's a castle there.
634;00:48:30,311;00:48:31,810;There's a mountain.
635;00:48:31,811;00:48:35,269;Looks like an arrowhead.
636;00:48:37,894;00:48:40,061;The dead are marching past.
637;00:48:45,019;00:48:46,852;Thousands of them.
638;00:48:52,977;00:48:54,394;Do you believe me now, Clegane?
639;00:48:56,019;00:48:58,019;Do you believe
639;00:48:56,019;00:48:58,019;we're here for a reason?
640;00:49:29,686;00:49:31,269;What the hell
640;00:49:29,686;00:49:31,269;are you doing, Clegane?
641;00:49:34,686;00:49:36,269;Burying the dead.
642;00:49:49,353;00:49:51,477;You knew these people.
643;00:49:51,478;00:49:52,977;Not really.
644;00:50:53,478;00:50:57,310;We ask the Father
644;00:50:53,478;00:50:57,310;to judge us with mercy.
645;00:50:57,311;00:51:00,353;We ask the Mother to...
646;00:51:03,186;00:51:05,353;Fuck it, I don't
646;00:51:03,186;00:51:05,353;remember the rest.
647;00:51:11,894;00:51:14,851;I'm sorry you're dead.
648;00:51:14,852;00:51:17,769;You deserved better.
649;00:51:17,770;00:51:18,770;Both of you.
650;00:51:42,728;00:51:44,393;Hey.
651;00:51:49,561;00:51:50,976;Mom.
652;00:51:50,977;00:51:52,728;You should really sleep, Sam.
653;00:51:54,186;00:51:55,728;The dead don't.
654;00:52:04,936;00:52:08,102;Legends of the Long Night.
655;00:52:09,852;00:52:13,101;The Targaryens used dragonglass
655;00:52:09,852;00:52:13,101;to decorate their weapons
656;00:52:13,102;00:52:15,645;without even knowing what
656;00:52:13,102;00:52:15,645;the First Men used it for.
657;00:52:32,936;00:52:33,936;What is it?
658;00:52:35,728;00:52:37,685;It's a map of Dragonstone.
659;00:52:37,686;00:52:39,976;The Targaryens built
659;00:52:37,686;00:52:39,976;their first stronghold there
660;00:52:39,977;00:52:41,770;when they invaded Westeros.
661;00:52:44,478;00:52:46,227;That's dragonglass?
662;00:52:46,228;00:52:47,976;A mountain of it.
663;00:52:47,977;00:52:49,143;Beneath the ground.
664;00:52:49,144;00:52:51,477;Stannis told me,
664;00:52:49,144;00:52:51,477;but I didn't think...
665;00:52:51,478;00:52:54,977;This is important.
665;00:52:51,478;00:52:54,977;Jon needs to know.
666;00:53:48,269;00:53:50,352;Has she come yet?
667;00:53:50,353;00:53:51,976;Who?
668;00:53:51,977;00:53:54,185;The Dragon Queen.
669;00:53:54,186;00:53:56,144;Daenerys Stormborn.
670;00:53:57,852;00:53:59,061;Haven't heard anything.
