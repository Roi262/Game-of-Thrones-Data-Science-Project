75;00:25:58,056;00:26:00,473;Light the trench!
76;00:26:29,807;00:26:31,015;She can't see us.

78;00:26:48,307;00:26:50,432;With a torch, light the trenches!
79;00:26:50,515;00:26:52,973;Right there.
79;00:26:50,515;00:26:52,973;Torch it!
80;00:26:54,599;00:26:55,682;Light the trenches!
81;00:29:40,557;00:29:41,515;Clegane.
82;00:29:47,682;00:29:50,682;You must try not to worry yourself.
83;00:30:02,682;00:30:05,849;At least we're already in a crypt.
84;00:30:10,557;00:30:12,515;If we were up there,
85;00:30:12,599;00:30:16,098;we might see something
85;00:30:12,599;00:30:16,098;everyone else is missing.
86;00:30:17,557;00:30:19,181;Something that makes a difference.
87;00:30:19,265;00:30:21,973;What?
88;00:30:22,056;00:30:23,682;Remember the Battle of Blackwater?
89;00:30:23,765;00:30:25,098;I brought us through the Mud Gate.
90;00:30:25,181;00:30:26,599;And got your face cut in half.
91;00:30:26,682;00:30:28,390;And it made a difference.
92;00:30:30,890;00:30:32,473;If I was out there right now...
93;00:30:32,557;00:30:33,931;You'd die.
94;00:30:36,265;00:30:38,265;There's nothing you can do.
95;00:30:41,849;00:30:44,140;You might be surprised
95;00:30:41,849;00:30:44,140;at the lengths I'd go
96;00:30:44,223;00:30:46,640;to avoid joining the Army of the Dead.
97;00:30:46,724;00:30:49,931;I could think of no organization
97;00:30:46,724;00:30:49,931;less suited to my talents.
98;00:30:50,015;00:30:52,432;Witty remarks won't make a difference.
99;00:30:54,807;00:30:57,973;That's why we're down here,
99;00:30:54,807;00:30:57,973;none of us can do anything.
100;00:30:59,807;00:31:00,890;It's the truth.
101;00:31:02,140;00:31:04,931;It's the most heroic thing
101;00:31:02,140;00:31:04,931;we can do now...
102;00:31:06,390;00:31:08,432;look the truth in the face.
103;00:31:13,265;00:31:15,682;Maybe we should have stayed married.
104;00:31:15,765;00:31:17,599;You were the best of them.
105;00:31:18,807;00:31:20,973;What a terrifying thought.
106;00:31:27,931;00:31:29,432;It wouldn't work between us.
107;00:31:30,765;00:31:32,432;Why not?
108;00:31:32,515;00:31:33,931;The Dragon Queen.
109;00:31:35,931;00:31:39,307;Your divided loyalties
109;00:31:35,931;00:31:39,307;would become a problem.
110;00:31:40,307;00:31:42,056;Yes.
111;00:31:42,140;00:31:44,973;Without the Dragon Queen,
111;00:31:42,140;00:31:44,973;there'd be no problem at all.
112;00:31:46,098;00:31:47,682;We'd all be dead already.
113;00:32:09,432;00:32:11,307;They lit the trench.
114;00:32:25,015;00:32:26,015;Bran...
115;00:32:31,432;00:32:33,348;I just want you to know...
116;00:32:37,515;00:32:38,473;I wish...
117;00:32:39,724;00:32:41,056;The things I did...
118;00:32:41,140;00:32:44,056;Everything you did
118;00:32:41,140;00:32:44,056;brought you where you are now.
119;00:32:46,348;00:32:47,724;Where you belong.
120;00:32:49,849;00:32:51,015;Home.
121;00:33:01,724;00:33:03,890;I'm going to go now.
122;00:33:06,557;00:33:07,557;Go where?
123;00:34:56,307;00:34:57,640;Man the walls!
124;00:34:58,682;00:35:00,307;Man the walls!
125;00:35:08,515;00:35:10,682;Man the wall!
126;00:35:10,765;00:35:12,348;Man the walls!
127;00:35:14,181;00:35:15,931;Come on!
128;00:35:16,015;00:35:18,807;Get out there! Get moving!
129;00:35:18,890;00:35:21,015;Come on. Come on! Come on!
130;00:35:24,473;00:35:26,849;Go, go, go!
131;00:35:26,931;00:35:28,390;Come on!
132;00:36:07,890;00:36:09,765;They're against the wall!
133;00:36:13,890;00:36:16,098;Get more men up here!
134;00:36:20,265;00:36:22,348;Fill the gaps, quickly!
134;00:36:20,265;00:36:22,348;Get in there!
135;00:36:22,432;00:36:23,973;They're climbing the walls!
136;00:36:24,056;00:36:26,599;Relieve the archers!
136;00:36:24,056;00:36:26,599;Relieve the archers!
137;00:36:28,473;00:36:29,849;Archers on top!

140;00:36:34,390;00:36:36,307;Go on, go on. Go! Go.
141;00:36:36,390;00:36:38,724;Step back.
141;00:36:36,390;00:36:38,724;All the way, archers!
142;00:36:54,432;00:36:55,682;Hold the wall!
143;00:36:55,765;00:36:57,307;The wall, they're coming up!

155;00:41:34,682;00:41:37,181;Don't you see that, you stupid whore?
156;00:41:37,265;00:41:38,973;We're fighting Death!
157;00:41:39,056;00:41:40,390;They can't beat Death.

164;00:49:36,348;00:49:37,515;Open it!
165;00:50:54,599;00:50:56,265;Rah!
166;00:51:03,015;00:51:04,098;Aah!

169;00:51:44,056;00:51:45,348;We've gotta go!
170;00:52:46,765;00:52:49,849;The Lord brought him back for a purpose.

172;00:53:01,890;00:53:02,890;I know you.
173;00:53:08,599;00:53:09,765;And I know you.
174;00:53:17,557;00:53:19,849;You said we'd meet again.
175;00:53:19,931;00:53:21,140;And here we are.
176;00:53:22,181;00:53:23,473;At the end of the world.
177;00:53:25,599;00:53:27,557;You said I'd shut many eyes forever.
178;00:53:29,223;00:53:30,765;You were right about that too.
179;00:53:31,849;00:53:33,682;Brown eyes...
180;00:53:33,765;00:53:34,973;green eyes...
181;00:53:37,307;00:53:38,640;and blue eyes.
182;00:53:58,098;00:54:00,807;What do we say to the God of Death?
183;00:54:05,056;00:54:06,140;Not today.
