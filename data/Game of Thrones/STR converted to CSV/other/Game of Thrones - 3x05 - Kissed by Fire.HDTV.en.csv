2;00:00:02,160;00:00:04,795;The Tyrells helped us
2;00:00:02,160;00:00:04,795;defeat Stannis Baratheon.
3;00:00:04,830;00:00:06,263;You must see Highgarden.
4;00:00:06,297;00:00:08,699;I don't think the queen
4;00:00:06,297;00:00:08,699;would let me leave King's Landing.
5;00:00:08,733;00:00:10,634;Once I marry Joffrey,
5;00:00:08,733;00:00:10,634;I'll be queen.
6;00:00:10,669;00:00:14,307;And if you were
6;00:00:10,669;00:00:14,307;to marry Loras...
7;00:00:14,341;00:00:16,944;You must give yourself
7;00:00:14,341;00:00:16,944;to the Lord of Light.
8;00:00:16,979;00:00:19,482;I have a wife.
8;00:00:16,979;00:00:19,482;She's shut away in a tower.
9;00:00:19,517;00:00:22,685;And she's given you no sons,
9;00:00:19,517;00:00:22,685;only stillborns.
10;00:00:22,720;00:00:26,557;I lost one son to the Kingslayer,
10;00:00:22,720;00:00:26,557;strangled with a chain.
11;00:00:26,591;00:00:28,159;I grieve for
11;00:00:26,591;00:00:28,159;your sons, my lord.
12;00:00:28,193;00:00:30,461;I don't want your grief.
12;00:00:28,193;00:00:30,461;I want my vengeance.
13;00:00:34,132;00:00:37,234;Do that again
13;00:00:34,132;00:00:37,234;and I'll take your other hand.
14;00:00:37,269;00:00:39,505;What value was the mill?
14;00:00:37,269;00:00:39,505;I seized an opportunity.
15;00:00:39,539;00:00:42,708;We took hostages--
15;00:00:39,539;00:00:42,708;Willem Lannister, Martyn Lannister.

19;00:00:48,570;00:00:50,527;Take him to the dungeon
19;00:00:48,570;00:00:50,527;and lock him in a cell.
20;00:00:50,804;00:00:52,138;You want to
20;00:00:50,804;00:00:52,138;assassinate a girl?

23;00:00:57,444;00:00:59,745;of a traitor.

26;00:01:03,885;00:01:06,253;You'll die soon enough,
26;00:01:03,885;00:01:06,253;but it won't be murder.
27;00:01:06,288;00:01:08,856;I sentence you
27;00:01:06,288;00:01:08,856;to trial by combat.
28;00:01:10,525;00:01:12,993;Is it done, then?

65;00:07:28,357;00:07:29,791;two rangers to watch
65;00:07:28,357;00:07:29,791;for enemies.
66;00:07:29,825;00:07:31,893;How often do these
66;00:07:29,825;00:07:31,893;patrols go out?
67;00:07:33,195;00:07:34,829;It varies.
68;00:07:34,863;00:07:37,499;If I knew where on the Wall we

69;00:07:37,533;00:07:40,002;You'd like to know that.
70;00:07:41,871;00:07:44,507;There are 19 castles
70;00:07:41,871;00:07:44,507;guarding the Wall.
71;00:07:45,976;00:07:48,344;How many are manned?
72;00:07:48,378;00:07:50,714;Three.
73;00:07:50,748;00:07:53,417;You sure of that?
74;00:07:55,086;00:07:56,687;Which three?
75;00:07:59,391;00:08:00,858;Castle Black.
76;00:08:00,892;00:08:02,726;Aye, Castle Black.
77;00:08:02,760;00:08:04,861;Everyone knows

78;00:08:04,896;00:08:06,896;Which others?
79;00:08:12,135;00:08:14,504;Eastwatch-by-the-Sea
80;00:08:14,538;00:08:17,440;and the Shadow Tower.
81;00:08:19,509;00:08:21,677;How many men remain
81;00:08:19,509;00:08:21,677;in Castle Black?
82;00:08:21,712;00:08:23,446;1,000.
82;00:08:21,712;00:08:23,446;Liar.
83;00:08:25,516;00:08:27,617;What happens to your eagle
83;00:08:25,516;00:08:27,617;after I kill you?
84;00:08:27,651;00:08:30,186;Does he drift away like a
84;00:08:27,651;00:08:30,186;kite with his strings cut
85;00:08:30,220;00:08:32,521;or does he just flop
85;00:08:30,220;00:08:32,521;dead to the ground?
86;00:08:32,556;00:08:34,056;He's no crow.
87;00:08:34,091;00:08:36,491;Just 'cause you want him inside
87;00:08:34,091;00:08:36,491;you don't make him one of us.
88;00:08:36,493;00:08:38,995;I'm not afraid of you.
89;00:08:45,202;00:08:47,169;I like you, boy.
90;00:08:47,204;00:08:50,106;But if you lie to me,
91;00:08:50,140;00:08:53,376;I'll pull your guts out
91;00:08:50,140;00:08:53,376;through your throat.
92;00:08:55,712;00:08:57,913;1,000 men.
93;00:09:02,919;00:09:05,788;We'll find out soon enough.
94;00:09:12,729;00:09:14,363;I don't need you
94;00:09:12,729;00:09:14,363;to protect me.
95;00:09:14,398;00:09:15,798;Of course you do.
96;00:09:15,832;00:09:18,667;Who stopped Rattleshirt
96;00:09:15,832;00:09:18,667;when he was about to cut your throat?
97;00:09:18,702;00:09:21,503;Who vouched for you
97;00:09:18,702;00:09:21,503;with Mance?
98;00:09:21,538;00:09:23,572;It seems
98;00:09:21,538;00:09:23,572;you owe me a debt.
99;00:09:24,941;00:09:27,443;Give it back.
99;00:09:24,941;00:09:27,443;Well, I stole it.
100;00:09:27,477;00:09:31,179;It's mine.
100;00:09:27,477;00:09:31,179;If you want it, come steal it back.

106;00:09:52,469;00:09:54,437;Are you still a crow?
107;00:09:55,873;00:09:59,208;It's time you
107;00:09:55,873;00:09:59,208;proved yourself.
108;00:09:59,243;00:10:00,977;Ygritte.
109;00:10:01,011;00:10:03,613;You swore some vows.
110;00:10:03,647;00:10:05,548;I want you to break 'em.
111;00:10:08,452;00:10:10,819;I want you to see me.
112;00:10:13,356;00:10:15,657;All of me.
113;00:10:29,305;00:10:31,106;We shouldn't.
114;00:10:33,543;00:10:35,377;We should.
115;00:10:55,097;00:10:57,332;Why are you
115;00:10:55,097;00:10:57,332;still dressed?
116;00:10:57,367;00:10:59,868;You know nothing,
116;00:10:57,367;00:10:59,868;Jon Sno--
117;00:11:14,984;00:11:16,918;That thing you did
118;00:11:16,953;00:11:18,920;with your mouth--
119;00:11:20,456;00:11:23,292;is that what lords
119;00:11:20,456;00:11:23,292;do to their ladies in the South?
120;00:11:23,326;00:11:25,461;I don't know.
121;00:11:25,495;00:11:27,263;I just wanted to kiss
121;00:11:25,495;00:11:27,263;you there is all.
122;00:11:27,331;00:11:28,765;Hmm.
123;00:11:28,799;00:11:30,500;You seemed to like it.
124;00:11:30,535;00:11:32,936;Aye, I liked it some.
125;00:11:32,971;00:11:34,538;Who taught you that?
126;00:11:34,572;00:11:37,441;There's been no one else.
126;00:11:34,572;00:11:37,441;Only you.
127;00:11:37,475;00:11:39,376;A maid.
128;00:11:39,410;00:11:41,245;You were a maid.
129;00:11:41,279;00:11:44,181;I was a man
129;00:11:41,279;00:11:44,181;of the Night's Watch.
130;00:11:45,883;00:11:48,118;How about you?
130;00:11:45,883;00:11:48,118;Were you a maid?
131;00:11:48,152;00:11:49,553;What do you think?
132;00:11:49,587;00:11:52,455;Who was he?
132;00:11:49,587;00:11:52,455;Just a boy.
133;00:11:52,490;00:11:55,091;He came trading
133;00:11:52,490;00:11:55,091;with his brothers.
134;00:11:55,126;00:11:58,294;He had red hair like me.
134;00:11:55,126;00:11:58,294;Kissed by fire.
135;00:11:58,329;00:12:00,229;But...
136;00:12:00,297;00:12:02,765;he was weak.
137;00:12:02,800;00:12:04,500;Not like you.
138;00:12:04,535;00:12:06,469;That was the first one.
139;00:12:06,504;00:12:08,472;Then there was
139;00:12:06,504;00:12:08,472;this Thenn boy.
140;00:12:08,506;00:12:11,942;Spoke no Common, but gods,
140;00:12:08,506;00:12:11,942;he was built like a mammoth.
141;00:12:11,977;00:12:15,145;Yeah, thanks.
141;00:12:11,977;00:12:15,145;I think I've heard enough.
142;00:12:17,916;00:12:19,783;We'd best get back.
143;00:12:19,818;00:12:22,186;Tormund--
144;00:12:24,489;00:12:26,524;I'm not done
144;00:12:24,489;00:12:26,524;with you yet.
145;00:12:33,565;00:12:35,966;How long's it been
145;00:12:33,565;00:12:35,966;since you had a bath?
146;00:12:51,649;00:12:53,617;Let's not go back.
147;00:12:54,919;00:12:57,521;Let's stay here
147;00:12:54,919;00:12:57,521;a while longer.
148;00:12:59,924;00:13:03,193;I don't ever want
148;00:12:59,924;00:13:03,193;to leave this cave, Jon Snow.
149;00:13:05,329;00:13:07,363;Not ever.
150;00:13:17,709;00:13:19,410;I want my gold.
151;00:13:19,444;00:13:20,878;It says it clearly
151;00:13:19,444;00:13:20,878;right there on that note
152;00:13:20,913;00:13:22,480;you'll be repaid in full
152;00:13:20,913;00:13:22,480;when the war is over.
153;00:13:22,514;00:13:24,849;Piss on that!
153;00:13:22,514;00:13:24,849;You're nothing but thieves.
154;00:13:24,883;00:13:27,084;We're outlaws.
154;00:13:24,883;00:13:27,084;Outlaws steal.
155;00:13:27,118;00:13:28,619;You're lucky
155;00:13:27,118;00:13:28,619;we didn't kill you.
156;00:13:28,653;00:13:29,620;Come try it, archer.
157;00:13:29,655;00:13:31,255;I'll shove those arrows
157;00:13:29,655;00:13:31,255;up your ass.
158;00:13:31,289;00:13:33,825;You can't let him go.
158;00:13:31,289;00:13:33,825;He's a murderer. He's guilty.
159;00:13:33,859;00:13:35,993;Not in the eyes of god.
159;00:13:33,859;00:13:35,993;You can't!
160;00:13:36,028;00:13:39,197;Enough! The judgment
160;00:13:36,028;00:13:39,197;isn't ours to make.
161;00:13:41,767;00:13:45,036;Go in peace,
161;00:13:41,767;00:13:45,036;Sandor Clegane.
162;00:13:45,071;00:13:46,804;The Lord of Light
162;00:13:45,071;00:13:46,804;isn't done with you yet.
163;00:13:51,844;00:13:54,778;Riders coming through!
164;00:14:05,424;00:14:06,891;The Kingslayer.
165;00:14:06,926;00:14:07,993;Down!
166;00:14:08,027;00:14:10,195;On your knees.
167;00:14:10,229;00:14:13,332;Lord Bolton, I give you
167;00:14:10,229;00:14:13,332;the Kingslayer.
168;00:14:15,035;00:14:16,936;Pick him up, Locke.
169;00:14:23,544;00:14:25,011;You've lost a hand.
170;00:14:25,045;00:14:27,880;No, my lord,
170;00:14:25,045;00:14:27,880;he has it here.
171;00:14:31,351;00:14:33,318;Take this away.
171;00:14:31,351;00:14:33,318;Send it to his father?
172;00:14:33,353;00:14:35,454;You'll hold your tongue
172;00:14:33,353;00:14:35,454;unless you want to lose it.
173;00:14:36,556;00:14:39,158;Cut her free.
173;00:14:36,556;00:14:39,158;Apologies, my lady.
174;00:14:39,192;00:14:41,226;You're under
174;00:14:39,192;00:14:41,226;my protection now.
175;00:14:41,260;00:14:43,896;Thank you, my lord.
176;00:14:47,100;00:14:49,201;Find suitable rooms
176;00:14:47,100;00:14:49,201;for our guests.
177;00:14:49,236;00:14:51,971;We'll speak later.
178;00:14:53,607;00:14:55,108;Lord Bolton.
179;00:14:58,946;00:15:00,980;Is there word
179;00:14:58,946;00:15:00,980;from the capital?
180;00:15:02,216;00:15:03,783;You haven't heard?
181;00:15:05,353;00:15:07,954;Stannis Baratheon laid siege
181;00:15:05,353;00:15:07,954;to King's Landing.
182;00:15:07,988;00:15:10,423;Sailed into Blackwater Bay.
183;00:15:10,458;00:15:13,694;Stormed the gates
183;00:15:10,458;00:15:13,694;with thousands of men.
184;00:15:15,030;00:15:16,730;And your sister...
185;00:15:22,103;00:15:24,204;How can I put this?
186;00:15:26,407;00:15:28,141;Your sister...
187;00:15:29,510;00:15:31,678;is alive and well.
188;00:15:31,712;00:15:34,514;Your father's forces
188;00:15:31,712;00:15:34,514;prevailed.
189;00:15:36,249;00:15:38,117;Ser Jaime isn't well.
190;00:15:38,151;00:15:40,586;Take him to Qyburn.
191;00:15:59,572;00:16:02,407;Will I die?
191;00:15:59,572;00:16:02,407;No.
192;00:16:02,441;00:16:03,842;The corruption
192;00:16:02,441;00:16:03,842;has spread.
193;00:16:03,876;00:16:05,877;I fear it must
193;00:16:03,876;00:16:05,877;be cut away.
194;00:16:05,911;00:16:08,980;The safest course would be
194;00:16:05,911;00:16:08,980;to take the whole arm off.
195;00:16:09,015;00:16:11,449;Then you'll die.
196;00:16:13,019;00:16:15,454;You're no maester.
197;00:16:15,488;00:16:18,223;Where's your chain?
198;00:16:18,258;00:16:20,325;The Citadel
198;00:16:18,258;00:16:20,325;stripped me of it.
199;00:16:20,360;00:16:23,595;They found some
199;00:16:20,360;00:16:23,595;of my experiments
200;00:16:23,663;00:16:25,597;too bold.
201;00:16:25,632;00:16:29,269;I can leave your upper arm,
201;00:16:25,632;00:16:29,269;make the cut at your elbow.
202;00:16:29,303;00:16:33,073;I don't need my right hand
202;00:16:29,303;00:16:33,073;to kill you.
203;00:16:34,141;00:16:36,543;I can take away
203;00:16:34,141;00:16:36,543;the rotting flesh
204;00:16:36,578;00:16:39,246;and try and burn out
204;00:16:36,578;00:16:39,246;the corruption
205;00:16:39,280;00:16:41,515;with boiling wine.
205;00:16:39,280;00:16:41,515;Mmm.
206;00:16:41,549;00:16:43,750;With any luck,
206;00:16:41,549;00:16:43,750;that will suffice.
207;00:16:43,818;00:16:46,286;You'll need
207;00:16:43,818;00:16:46,286;milk of the poppy.
208;00:16:47,589;00:16:49,589;No milk of the poppy.
208;00:16:47,589;00:16:49,589;There will be pain.
209;00:16:49,624;00:16:52,793;I'll scream.
209;00:16:49,624;00:16:52,793;Quite a bit of pain.
210;00:16:52,827;00:16:54,929;I'll scream loudly.
211;00:17:29,665;00:17:31,299;Lord Baelish.
212;00:17:31,333;00:17:32,967;Your Grace.
213;00:17:33,002;00:17:34,969;I wonder if I might
213;00:17:33,002;00:17:34,969;ask you for a favor.
214;00:17:35,003;00:17:36,404;Of course, Your Grace.
215;00:17:36,438;00:17:37,838;I have reason to believe
215;00:17:36,438;00:17:37,838;that House Tyrell
216;00:17:37,872;00:17:39,907;do not hold the crown's
216;00:17:37,872;00:17:39,907;best interests at heart.
217;00:17:39,941;00:17:44,411;I see. And have you shared these
217;00:17:39,941;00:17:44,411;suspicions with Lord Tywin?
218;00:17:44,445;00:17:47,380;My father's a practical man.
218;00:17:44,445;00:17:47,380;He appreciates facts.
219;00:17:47,415;00:17:50,083;Myself, I often
219;00:17:47,415;00:17:50,083;find them a hindrance.
220;00:17:50,118;00:17:53,220;And he appreciates those
220;00:17:50,118;00:17:53,220;who aid his family, as you well know.
221;00:17:53,255;00:17:54,789;He's almost as generous
221;00:17:53,255;00:17:54,789;to those who help us
222;00:17:54,823;00:17:58,025;as he is unpleasant
222;00:17:54,823;00:17:58,025;towards those who don't.
223;00:17:58,059;00:18:00,526;You have a good working
223;00:17:58,059;00:18:00,526;relationship with the Tyrells.
224;00:18:00,561;00:18:03,462;I thought you might look into it
224;00:18:00,561;00:18:03,462;before you leave the capital.
225;00:18:03,497;00:18:05,664;I shall do my best.
225;00:18:03,497;00:18:05,664;Thank you.
226;00:18:05,699;00:18:09,168;And your best will prove better than
226;00:18:05,699;00:18:09,168;when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
227;00:18:09,202;00:18:10,970;I assure you
227;00:18:09,202;00:18:10,970;that it will.
228;00:18:18,244;00:18:20,578;Gods, boy, that's enough.
228;00:18:18,244;00:18:20,578;We're not in a tavern.
229;00:18:20,613;00:18:22,013;Pardon, my lady.
229;00:18:20,613;00:18:22,013;No need to speak.
230;00:18:22,048;00:18:24,249;Are there any figs?
230;00:18:22,048;00:18:24,249;Fetch some.
231;00:18:24,283;00:18:26,385;I always take figs
231;00:18:24,283;00:18:26,385;midafternoon.
232;00:18:26,419;00:18:27,886;They help move the bowels.
233;00:18:27,921;00:18:29,988;To what do I owe
233;00:18:27,921;00:18:29,988;this summons?
234;00:18:30,023;00:18:32,057;Thank you for seeing me,
234;00:18:30,023;00:18:32,057;my lady.
235;00:18:32,092;00:18:34,326;I had hoped we might discuss
235;00:18:32,092;00:18:34,326;a few financial matters.
236;00:18:34,360;00:18:38,130;I climbed all those steps to discuss
236;00:18:34,360;00:18:38,130;financial matters?
237;00:18:38,164;00:18:39,431;It's the royal wedding.
238;00:18:39,465;00:18:40,866;I'm told you had a hand
238;00:18:39,465;00:18:40,866;in planning it.
239;00:18:40,900;00:18:42,067;Naturally.
240;00:18:42,101;00:18:44,569;It's shaping up to be
240;00:18:42,101;00:18:44,569;a very involved affair.
241;00:18:44,603;00:18:46,704;The word extravagant
241;00:18:44,603;00:18:46,704;has been used.
242;00:18:46,739;00:18:48,406;What good
242;00:18:46,739;00:18:48,406;is the word extravagant
243;00:18:48,440;00:18:50,842;if it can't be used
243;00:18:48,440;00:18:50,842;to describe a royal wedding?
244;00:18:50,876;00:18:52,944;I understand that.
244;00:18:50,876;00:18:52,944;Good.
245;00:18:52,978;00:18:55,446;But, as Master of Coin,
245;00:18:52,978;00:18:55,446;it falls upon me
246;00:18:55,480;00:18:57,114;to calculate the cost
246;00:18:55,480;00:18:57,114;for the crown.
247;00:18:57,149;00:18:59,651;As of now,
247;00:18:57,149;00:18:59,651;it's a huge expense.
248;00:18:59,685;00:19:00,818;And?
249;00:19:00,853;00:19:04,522;And we're at war,
249;00:19:00,853;00:19:04,522;Lady Olenna.
250;00:19:04,556;00:19:06,925;Oh, I'd nearly
250;00:19:04,556;00:19:06,925;forgotten.
251;00:19:06,959;00:19:08,326;Yes, and maintaining
251;00:19:06,959;00:19:08,326;supply lines--
252;00:19:08,360;00:19:10,094;I can't think
252;00:19:08,360;00:19:10,094;how it slipped my mind.
253;00:19:10,129;00:19:12,730;What is it,
253;00:19:10,129;00:19:12,730;12,000 infantrymen
254;00:19:12,764;00:19:14,565;the Tyrell family
254;00:19:12,764;00:19:14,565;has supplied?
255;00:19:14,599;00:19:16,867;1,800 mounted lances.
256;00:19:16,902;00:19:18,869;2,000 in support.
257;00:19:18,904;00:19:22,006;Provisions so this city
257;00:19:18,904;00:19:22,006;might survive the winter.
258;00:19:22,040;00:19:23,741;A million bushels
258;00:19:22,040;00:19:23,741;of wheat.
259;00:19:23,775;00:19:27,311;Half a million bushels each
259;00:19:23,775;00:19:27,311;of barley, oats, and rye.
260;00:19:27,346;00:19:29,113;20,000 head of cattle.
261;00:19:29,148;00:19:30,715;50,000 sheep.
262;00:19:30,750;00:19:33,218;You don't have to lecture me
262;00:19:30,750;00:19:33,218;about wartime expenses.
263;00:19:33,253;00:19:35,254;I'm quite familiar
263;00:19:33,253;00:19:35,254;with them.
264;00:19:35,288;00:19:36,956;And we are so grateful
264;00:19:35,288;00:19:36,956;for your contributions
265;00:19:36,990;00:19:39,525;which are necessary
265;00:19:36,990;00:19:39,525;for the preservation of the realm.
266;00:19:39,593;00:19:41,428;As is a royal wedding.
267;00:19:41,462;00:19:44,031;The people are hungry
267;00:19:41,462;00:19:44,031;for more than just food.
268;00:19:44,065;00:19:45,499;They crave distractions.
269;00:19:45,533;00:19:48,802;And if we don't provide them,
269;00:19:45,533;00:19:48,802;they'll create their own.
270;00:19:48,837;00:19:51,472;And their distractions
270;00:19:48,837;00:19:51,472;are likely to end
271;00:19:51,506;00:19:53,774;with us being torn
271;00:19:51,506;00:19:53,774;to pieces.
272;00:19:53,809;00:19:56,143;A royal wedding
272;00:19:53,809;00:19:56,143;is much safer.
273;00:19:56,178;00:19:59,213;Wouldn't you say?
273;00:19:56,178;00:19:59,213;I would.
274;00:19:59,248;00:20:01,415;And traditionally
274;00:19:59,248;00:20:01,415;paid for
275;00:20:01,450;00:20:03,518;by the royal family.
276;00:20:04,820;00:20:07,188;I was told you were
276;00:20:04,820;00:20:07,188;drunk, impertinent,
277;00:20:07,222;00:20:09,223;and thoroughly debauched.
278;00:20:09,258;00:20:10,825;You can imagine
278;00:20:09,258;00:20:10,825;my disappointment
279;00:20:10,860;00:20:13,828;at finding nothing
279;00:20:10,860;00:20:13,828;but a browbeaten bookkeeper.
280;00:20:15,731;00:20:18,299;Where did you go
280;00:20:15,731;00:20:18,299;for them, Volantis?
281;00:20:19,401;00:20:21,235;My lady--
281;00:20:19,401;00:20:21,235;Oh, very well.
282;00:20:21,270;00:20:23,271;I won't have it said
282;00:20:21,270;00:20:23,271;that House Tyrell
283;00:20:23,305;00:20:25,006;refuses to play
283;00:20:23,305;00:20:25,006;its part.
284;00:20:25,040;00:20:26,574;We'll pay for half
284;00:20:25,040;00:20:26,574;the expenses
285;00:20:26,609;00:20:29,243;and the celebrations
285;00:20:26,609;00:20:29,243;will go on as planned.
286;00:20:29,278;00:20:31,078;Is that sufficient?
286;00:20:29,278;00:20:31,078;Quite sufficient. Thank you.
287;00:20:31,113;00:20:33,448;Very good, then.
287;00:20:31,113;00:20:33,448;That's settled. Good day.
288;00:20:36,518;00:20:38,586;Give me that.
289;00:20:43,425;00:20:45,226;What are you doing?
290;00:20:46,329;00:20:48,363;Just mending
290;00:20:46,329;00:20:48,363;Lord Beric's armor.
291;00:20:48,397;00:20:50,599;Why?
292;00:20:50,633;00:20:53,034;I'm going to stay on
292;00:20:50,633;00:20:53,034;and smith for the Brotherhood.
293;00:20:53,068;00:20:54,936;Have you lost your mind?
294;00:20:54,970;00:20:58,473;When the Lannisters find this place,
294;00:20:54,970;00:20:58,473;you think they'll spare the smiths?
295;00:20:58,507;00:21:00,108;They'll cave your head in
295;00:20:58,507;00:21:00,108;with your own helmet.
296;00:21:00,142;00:21:02,910;The Lannisters wanted to kill me long
296;00:21:00,142;00:21:02,910;before I joined the Brotherhood.
297;00:21:02,944;00:21:04,879;You don't have to do this.
298;00:21:04,913;00:21:06,714;I want to.
299;00:21:06,748;00:21:08,182;They need good men.
300;00:21:08,217;00:21:11,519;Robb needs good men, too.
300;00:21:08,217;00:21:11,519;We're leaving tomorrow.
301;00:21:11,553;00:21:13,921;And then you--
301;00:21:11,553;00:21:13,921;What? Serve him?
302;00:21:14,990;00:21:17,992;I've served men
302;00:21:14,990;00:21:17,992;my entire life.
303;00:21:18,026;00:21:19,827;I served Master Mott
303;00:21:18,026;00:21:19,827;at King's Landing
304;00:21:19,861;00:21:22,463;and he sold me
304;00:21:19,861;00:21:22,463;to the Watch.
305;00:21:22,497;00:21:24,098;I served Lord Tywin
305;00:21:22,497;00:21:24,098;at Harrenhal,
306;00:21:24,132;00:21:27,067;wondering every day
306;00:21:24,132;00:21:27,067;if I'd get tortured or killed.
307;00:21:28,269;00:21:29,503;I'm done serving.
308;00:21:29,537;00:21:31,872;You just said you were
308;00:21:29,537;00:21:31,872;serving Lord Beric.
309;00:21:33,141;00:21:36,676;He may be their leader,
309;00:21:33,141;00:21:36,676;but they chose him.
310;00:21:36,711;00:21:39,846;These men are brothers.
310;00:21:36,711;00:21:39,846;They're a family.
311;00:21:41,650;00:21:43,450;I've never had a family.
312;00:21:46,388;00:21:48,122;I can be your family.
313;00:21:51,193;00:21:53,995;You wouldn't be
313;00:21:51,193;00:21:53,995;my family.
314;00:21:54,029;00:21:55,630;You'd be my lady.
315;00:22:14,484;00:22:16,318;Willem.
316;00:22:18,888;00:22:20,489;Willem!
317;00:22:23,527;00:22:26,863;Is this a rescue?
317;00:22:23,527;00:22:26,863;Lannister filth! Take him!
318;00:22:26,897;00:22:29,265;Please, I didn't do anything.
318;00:22:26,897;00:22:29,265;I'm just a squire.
319;00:22:29,300;00:22:31,100;Please--
320;00:22:43,881;00:22:45,315;Bring them in.
321;00:23:01,698;00:23:03,298;Is that all of them?
322;00:23:05,568;00:23:08,638;It took five of you to murder
322;00:23:05,568;00:23:08,638;two unarmed squires?
323;00:23:08,672;00:23:10,573;Not murder,
323;00:23:08,672;00:23:10,573;Your Grace.
324;00:23:10,607;00:23:12,141;Vengeance.
325;00:23:12,175;00:23:14,677;Vengeance?
326;00:23:14,711;00:23:17,079;Those boys didn't
326;00:23:14,711;00:23:17,079;kill your sons.
327;00:23:17,113;00:23:20,182;I saw Harrion die
327;00:23:17,113;00:23:20,182;on the battlefield and Torrhen--
328;00:23:20,216;00:23:22,217;Was strangled
328;00:23:20,216;00:23:22,217;by the Kingslayer.
329;00:23:22,251;00:23:24,519;They were his kin.
329;00:23:22,251;00:23:24,519;They were boys!
330;00:23:26,688;00:23:28,456;Look at them.
331;00:23:30,258;00:23:31,892;Tell your mother
331;00:23:30,258;00:23:31,892;to look at them.
332;00:23:31,927;00:23:34,228;She killed them
332;00:23:31,927;00:23:34,228;as much as I.
333;00:23:34,262;00:23:36,897;My mother had nothing
333;00:23:34,262;00:23:36,897;to do with this.
334;00:23:36,931;00:23:38,765;This was your treason.
335;00:23:38,800;00:23:41,234;It's treason
335;00:23:38,800;00:23:41,234;to free your enemies.
336;00:23:41,268;00:23:43,369;In war, you kill
336;00:23:41,268;00:23:43,369;your enemies.
337;00:23:43,403;00:23:45,505;Did your father
337;00:23:43,403;00:23:45,505;not teach you that, boy?
338;00:23:45,539;00:23:47,573;Leave him.
339;00:23:51,745;00:23:53,346;Aye.
340;00:23:53,380;00:23:55,714;Leave me to the king.
341;00:23:55,749;00:23:59,385;He wants to give me
341;00:23:55,749;00:23:59,385;a scolding before he sets me free.
342;00:24:00,487;00:24:03,889;That's how he deals
342;00:24:00,487;00:24:03,889;with treason.
343;00:24:03,924;00:24:06,225;Our King in the North.
344;00:24:06,259;00:24:08,627;Or should I call him
345;00:24:08,662;00:24:11,697;the King Who Lost
345;00:24:08,662;00:24:11,697;the North?
346;00:24:14,501;00:24:17,035;Escort Lord Karstark
346;00:24:14,501;00:24:17,035;to the dungeon.
347;00:24:17,070;00:24:18,770;Hang the rest.
348;00:24:18,805;00:24:20,272;Mercy, sire!
348;00:24:18,805;00:24:20,272;I didn't kill anyone.
349;00:24:20,307;00:24:21,774;I only watched
349;00:24:20,307;00:24:21,774;for the guards.
350;00:24:21,808;00:24:23,943;This one was only
350;00:24:21,808;00:24:23,943;the watcher.
351;00:24:23,977;00:24:26,045;Hang him last so he can watch
351;00:24:23,977;00:24:26,045;the others die.
352;00:24:26,079;00:24:28,181;Please! Please, no.
352;00:24:26,079;00:24:28,181;They made me do it!
353;00:24:28,215;00:24:32,151;They made me!
353;00:24:28,215;00:24:32,151;They made me!
354;00:24:40,227;00:24:42,662;Word of this
354;00:24:40,227;00:24:42,662;can't leave Riverrun.
355;00:24:42,696;00:24:44,564;They were Tywin
355;00:24:42,696;00:24:44,564;Lannister's nephews.
356;00:24:44,598;00:24:46,299;The Lannisters
356;00:24:44,598;00:24:46,299;pay their debts.
357;00:24:46,333;00:24:47,734;They never stop
357;00:24:46,333;00:24:47,734;talking about it.
358;00:24:47,768;00:24:49,703;Would you make me a liar
358;00:24:47,768;00:24:49,703;as well as a murderer?
359;00:24:49,737;00:24:51,471;It wouldn't be lying.
360;00:24:51,505;00:24:53,706;We will bury them
360;00:24:51,505;00:24:53,706;and remain silent
361;00:24:53,741;00:24:55,141;until the war is done.
362;00:24:55,175;00:24:56,576;I'm not fighting
362;00:24:55,175;00:24:56,576;for justice
363;00:24:56,610;00:24:59,479;if I don't serve justice
363;00:24:56,610;00:24:59,479;to murderers in my ranks,
364;00:24:59,513;00:25:02,449;no matter how highborn.
365;00:25:02,483;00:25:05,052;He has to die.
366;00:25:05,086;00:25:07,788;The Karstarks
366;00:25:05,086;00:25:07,788;are Northmen.
367;00:25:07,822;00:25:10,157;They won't forgive
367;00:25:07,822;00:25:10,157;the killing of their lord.
368;00:25:10,191;00:25:12,159;Your mother's right.
369;00:25:12,193;00:25:14,962;If you do this, the Karstarks will
369;00:25:12,193;00:25:14,962;abandon you.
370;00:25:14,996;00:25:17,064;You tended to their wounds.
371;00:25:17,099;00:25:19,801;You brought them supper.
371;00:25:17,099;00:25:19,801;Now they're dead.
372;00:25:19,835;00:25:23,672;And more boys will keep dying
372;00:25:19,835;00:25:23,672;until this war is over.
373;00:25:23,706;00:25:25,841;You need Karstark men
373;00:25:23,706;00:25:25,841;to end it.
374;00:25:25,875;00:25:28,310;Spare his life.
374;00:25:25,875;00:25:28,310;Keep him as a hostage.
375;00:25:28,344;00:25:30,412;A hostage.
376;00:25:30,447;00:25:33,750;Tell the Karstarks
376;00:25:30,447;00:25:33,750;that as long as they remain loyal,
377;00:25:33,784;00:25:35,852;he will not be harmed.
378;00:26:00,878;00:26:04,147;The blood of the First Men
378;00:26:00,878;00:26:04,147;flows through my veins
379;00:26:04,181;00:26:07,183;as much as yours, boy.
380;00:26:07,218;00:26:09,919;I fought the Mad King
380;00:26:07,218;00:26:09,919;for your father.
381;00:26:09,953;00:26:13,557;I fought Joffrey
381;00:26:09,953;00:26:13,557;for you.
382;00:26:13,592;00:26:15,059;We are kin--
383;00:26:15,093;00:26:17,394;Stark and Karstark.
384;00:26:17,428;00:26:19,829;That didn't stop you
384;00:26:17,428;00:26:19,829;from betraying me.
385;00:26:19,864;00:26:21,431;And it won't save you now.
386;00:26:21,465;00:26:24,333;I don't want it
386;00:26:21,465;00:26:24,333;to save me.
387;00:26:24,368;00:26:28,004;I want it to haunt you
387;00:26:24,368;00:26:28,004;to the end of your days.
388;00:26:28,939;00:26:30,673;Kneel, my lord.
389;00:26:39,650;00:26:42,151;Rickard Karstark,
390;00:26:42,186;00:26:43,753;Lord of Karhold,
391;00:26:43,788;00:26:47,291;here in sight of gods and men,
391;00:26:43,788;00:26:47,291;I sentence you to die.
392;00:26:47,325;00:26:50,227;Would you speak
392;00:26:47,325;00:26:50,227;a final word?
393;00:26:51,363;00:26:53,898;Kill me
393;00:26:51,363;00:26:53,898;and be cursed.
394;00:26:53,933;00:26:57,035;You are no king of mine.
395;00:27:11,083;00:27:13,651;Joffrey.
396;00:27:13,685;00:27:15,686;Cersei.
397;00:27:17,356;00:27:19,357;Ilyn Payne.
398;00:27:20,927;00:27:22,928;Ser Meryn.
399;00:27:26,066;00:27:28,134;The Hound.
400;00:27:31,605;00:27:33,573;What are you
400;00:27:31,605;00:27:33,573;going to do with me?
401;00:27:33,608;00:27:36,243;At first light
401;00:27:33,608;00:27:36,243;we'll ride for Riverrun.
402;00:27:36,277;00:27:38,111;Your brother's there now.
403;00:27:38,146;00:27:40,614;He'll make a contribution
403;00:27:38,146;00:27:40,614;to our cause
404;00:27:40,648;00:27:42,316;and you can go home.
405;00:27:42,350;00:27:45,085;I'm a hostage
405;00:27:42,350;00:27:45,085;and you're selling me.
406;00:27:45,120;00:27:46,554;Don't think of it
406;00:27:45,120;00:27:46,554;that way.
407;00:27:46,588;00:27:49,256;But it is that way.
407;00:27:46,588;00:27:49,256;It is.
408;00:27:49,291;00:27:52,125;And it isn't.
408;00:27:49,291;00:27:52,125;More is than isn't.
409;00:27:54,095;00:27:57,264;Beric admired your father
409;00:27:54,095;00:27:57,264;a great deal, you know.
410;00:27:57,298;00:27:59,433;He wanted to refuse
410;00:27:57,298;00:27:59,433;your ransom altogether.
411;00:27:59,467;00:28:02,969;So why don't you?
411;00:27:59,467;00:28:02,969;We need the gold.
412;00:28:15,083;00:28:16,750;Do I frighten you, child?
413;00:28:16,785;00:28:18,619;No.
414;00:28:21,456;00:28:23,190;You're angry with me.
415;00:28:23,224;00:28:24,858;And I don't blame you.
416;00:28:24,892;00:28:26,412;But letting him go
416;00:28:24,892;00:28:26,412;was the right thing.
417;00:28:26,427;00:28:28,996;I have more reason than most
417;00:28:26,427;00:28:28,996;to want him hanged.
418;00:28:29,030;00:28:31,531;I thought he killed you.
418;00:28:29,030;00:28:31,531;He did.
419;00:28:31,566;00:28:33,400;But how...?
420;00:28:33,434;00:28:35,602;Thoros...
421;00:28:35,636;00:28:37,504;how many times
421;00:28:35,636;00:28:37,504;have you brought me back?
422;00:28:37,538;00:28:41,007;It's the Lord of Light
422;00:28:37,538;00:28:41,007;brings you back.
423;00:28:41,041;00:28:43,275;I'm just the lucky drunk
423;00:28:41,041;00:28:43,275;who says the words.
424;00:28:43,310;00:28:45,944;How many times?
424;00:28:43,310;00:28:45,944;Five, I think.
425;00:28:45,979;00:28:48,113;No, this makes six.
426;00:28:48,147;00:28:49,481;Six.
427;00:28:49,515;00:28:52,484;There was the first time--
427;00:28:49,515;00:28:52,484;the Mountain.
428;00:28:52,518;00:28:54,052;Show her.
429;00:28:54,086;00:28:57,855;Lance right through
429;00:28:54,086;00:28:57,855;the chest.
430;00:28:57,890;00:29:00,325;Then I was stabbed
430;00:28:57,890;00:29:00,325;in the belly.
431;00:29:00,359;00:29:01,726;Then it was an arrow
431;00:29:00,359;00:29:01,726;in the back.
432;00:29:01,760;00:29:04,495;And that axe in the side.
433;00:29:04,530;00:29:07,865;Then the Lannisters caught me
433;00:29:04,530;00:29:07,865;and executed me for treason.
434;00:29:09,401;00:29:11,736;Was it a hanging
434;00:29:09,401;00:29:11,736;or a dagger in the eye?
435;00:29:11,803;00:29:14,939;Both.
435;00:29:11,803;00:29:14,939;Fuckers couldn't decide.
436;00:29:14,973;00:29:17,508;And the Hound makes six.
437;00:29:17,543;00:29:19,678;Second time I've been
437;00:29:17,543;00:29:19,678;killed by a Clegane.
438;00:29:19,712;00:29:21,713;You'd think you'd learn.
439;00:29:23,416;00:29:25,951;It's not getting
439;00:29:23,416;00:29:25,951;any easier, you know.
440;00:29:25,985;00:29:27,986;I know.
441;00:29:28,020;00:29:30,121;Every time I come back,
442;00:29:30,156;00:29:32,190;I'm a bit less.
443;00:29:33,860;00:29:36,194;Pieces of you
443;00:29:33,860;00:29:36,194;get chipped away.
444;00:29:37,696;00:29:39,998;Could you bring back
444;00:29:37,696;00:29:39,998;a man without a head?
445;00:29:42,000;00:29:45,636;Not six times.
445;00:29:42,000;00:29:45,636;Just once.
446;00:29:45,671;00:29:48,573;I don't think it works
446;00:29:45,671;00:29:48,573;that way, child.
447;00:29:53,546;00:29:57,149;He was a good man,
447;00:29:53,546;00:29:57,149;Ned Stark.
448;00:29:57,183;00:30:01,086;He's at rest now,
448;00:29:57,183;00:30:01,086;somewhere.
449;00:30:01,120;00:30:03,521;I would never wish
449;00:30:01,120;00:30:03,521;my life upon him.
450;00:30:03,556;00:30:05,690;I would.
451;00:30:07,994;00:30:10,095;You're alive.
452;00:30:15,100;00:30:18,102;Lord, cast your light
452;00:30:15,100;00:30:18,102;upon me.
453;00:30:19,137;00:30:22,507;Protect me
453;00:30:19,137;00:30:22,507;in the darkness.
454;00:30:22,541;00:30:26,044;Burn away my sins.
455;00:30:26,078;00:30:29,314;Help me serve you.
456;00:30:29,349;00:30:31,517;Use me as you will.
457;00:30:33,987;00:30:36,589;For the night is dark
458;00:30:36,624;00:30:39,125;and full of terrors.
459;00:30:50,204;00:30:53,106;I have prayed day and night
459;00:30:50,204;00:30:53,106;for you to come to me.
460;00:30:54,742;00:30:56,810;My lady.
461;00:30:56,844;00:30:59,679;I meant to come sooner.
462;00:30:59,713;00:31:02,949;The battle--
462;00:30:59,713;00:31:02,949;I know of your troubles, my king.
463;00:31:02,983;00:31:05,719;The Lady Melisandre
463;00:31:02,983;00:31:05,719;has told me everything.
464;00:31:05,753;00:31:08,255;Yes, of course.
465;00:31:17,500;00:31:20,769;You mustn't despair.
465;00:31:17,500;00:31:20,769;Your claim is true.
466;00:31:20,803;00:31:23,571;You will be victorious.
466;00:31:20,803;00:31:23,571;I believed that once.
467;00:31:23,606;00:31:27,042;You are
467;00:31:23,606;00:31:27,042;the one god's champion
468;00:31:27,076;00:31:29,311;and the finest man
468;00:31:27,076;00:31:29,311;I've ever known.
469;00:31:29,345;00:31:31,813;Selyse.
470;00:31:33,115;00:31:35,650;I've broken a sacred vow.
471;00:31:39,121;00:31:40,489;I've sinned.
472;00:31:40,523;00:31:43,659;No.
472;00:31:40,523;00:31:43,659;I've wronged you.
473;00:31:43,693;00:31:47,296;I have shamed you.
473;00:31:43,693;00:31:47,296;You're doing god's work.
474;00:31:47,331;00:31:49,399;You don't understand.
475;00:31:55,039;00:31:57,107;The Red Woman--
476;00:31:58,777;00:32:00,577;the Lady Melisandre--
477;00:32:00,612;00:32:02,579;I know, Stannis.
478;00:32:02,614;00:32:06,650;The Lady Melisandre
478;00:32:02,614;00:32:06,650;has told me everything.
479;00:32:06,684;00:32:09,920;No act done in service
479;00:32:06,684;00:32:09,920;of the Lord of Light
480;00:32:09,955;00:32:12,723;can ever be a sin.
481;00:32:12,757;00:32:16,027;When she told me,
482;00:32:16,061;00:32:20,264;I wept with joy.
483;00:32:30,743;00:32:34,412;Oh, my sweet boys.
484;00:32:35,914;00:32:39,584;Petyr, Tommard,
485;00:32:39,618;00:32:41,620;Edric.
486;00:32:42,722;00:32:46,458;I thank god
486;00:32:42,722;00:32:46,458;every day
487;00:32:46,493;00:32:49,529;for bringing
487;00:32:46,493;00:32:49,529;Melisandre to us.
488;00:32:49,563;00:32:51,898;She gave you a son.
489;00:32:53,201;00:32:55,869;I gave you...
490;00:32:57,038;00:32:59,472;nothing.
490;00:32:57,038;00:32:59,472;That's not true.
491;00:33:04,311;00:33:06,912;So you've come
491;00:33:04,311;00:33:06,912;to see her as well?
492;00:33:09,348;00:33:11,282;There is no need.
493;00:33:12,685;00:33:15,252;You must keep away
493;00:33:12,685;00:33:15,252;from such distractions.
494;00:33:15,287;00:33:16,987;She's my daughter.
495;00:33:19,257;00:33:20,624;I want to see her.
496;00:33:23,328;00:33:25,964;You are a king.
497;00:33:25,998;00:33:28,800;You don't need
497;00:33:25,998;00:33:28,800;my permission.

507;00:34:04,472;00:34:06,572;since I last saw you.
508;00:34:06,607;00:34:10,110;Mother said you fought

517;00:34:29,196;00:34:31,730;He's my friend.
518;00:34:31,765;00:34:33,332;Look.
519;00:34:40,472;00:34:42,540;He made this for me.
520;00:34:42,575;00:34:44,943;But don't tell Mother
520;00:34:42,575;00:34:44,943;I have it.

523;00:34:51,751;00:34:54,053;is a traitor.

528;00:35:26,720;00:35:28,054;I need a bath.
529;00:35:28,088;00:35:30,724;Help me out
529;00:35:28,088;00:35:30,724;of these rags.
530;00:35:37,732;00:35:40,200;Now get out.
531;00:35:52,614;00:35:54,248;There's another tub.
532;00:35:54,282;00:35:57,217;This one suits me fine.
533;00:36:09,930;00:36:12,731;Don't worry.
533;00:36:09,930;00:36:12,731;I'm not interested.
534;00:36:14,867;00:36:18,136;If I faint, pull me out.
535;00:36:18,170;00:36:21,205;I don't intend to be the first Lannister
535;00:36:18,170;00:36:21,205;to die in a bathtub.
536;00:36:21,240;00:36:23,007;Why should I care
536;00:36:21,240;00:36:23,007;how you die?
537;00:36:23,041;00:36:26,010;You swore a solemn vow,
537;00:36:23,041;00:36:26,010;remember?
538;00:36:26,044;00:36:29,713;You're supposed to get me to
538;00:36:26,044;00:36:29,713;King's Landing in one piece.
539;00:36:30,682;00:36:33,183;Not going so well, is it?
540;00:36:33,218;00:36:35,852;No wonder Renly died
540;00:36:33,218;00:36:35,852;with you guarding him.
541;00:36:45,663;00:36:47,998;That was unworthy.
541;00:36:45,663;00:36:47,998;Forgive me.
542;00:36:48,032;00:36:50,000;You protected me
542;00:36:48,032;00:36:50,000;better than most--
543;00:36:50,034;00:36:52,770;Don't you mock me.
543;00:36:50,034;00:36:52,770;I'm apologizing.
544;00:36:54,573;00:36:56,641;I'm sick of fighting.
545;00:36:56,675;00:36:58,143;Let's call a truce.
546;00:36:58,177;00:36:59,978;You need trust
546;00:36:58,177;00:36:59,978;to have a truce.
547;00:37:01,380;00:37:03,649;I trust you.
548;00:37:10,458;00:37:13,527;There it is.
548;00:37:10,458;00:37:13,527;There's the look.
549;00:37:13,561;00:37:16,030;I've seen it for 17 years
550;00:37:16,064;00:37:17,698;on face after face.
551;00:37:17,732;00:37:20,968;You all despise me.
552;00:37:21,002;00:37:22,736;Kingslayer.
553;00:37:22,771;00:37:24,939;Oathbreaker.
554;00:37:24,973;00:37:27,875;A man without honor.
555;00:37:33,514;00:37:35,048;You've heard of wildfire?
556;00:37:35,082;00:37:36,583;Of course.
557;00:37:36,617;00:37:39,386;The Mad King
557;00:37:36,617;00:37:39,386;was obsessed with it.
558;00:37:39,420;00:37:41,955;He loved to watch
558;00:37:39,420;00:37:41,955;people burn,
559;00:37:41,989;00:37:44,524;the way their skin
559;00:37:41,989;00:37:44,524;blackened and blistered
560;00:37:44,558;00:37:47,160;and melted
560;00:37:44,558;00:37:47,160;off their bones.
561;00:37:47,195;00:37:49,363;He burned lords
561;00:37:47,195;00:37:49,363;he didn't like.
562;00:37:49,397;00:37:51,465;He burned Hands
562;00:37:49,397;00:37:51,465;who disobeyed him.
563;00:37:51,499;00:37:54,934;He burned anyone
563;00:37:51,499;00:37:54,934;who was against him.
564;00:37:56,337;00:37:59,638;Before long, half the country
564;00:37:56,337;00:37:59,638;was against him.
565;00:38:02,442;00:38:05,043;Aerys saw traitors
565;00:38:02,442;00:38:05,043;everywhere.
566;00:38:06,513;00:38:10,582;So he had his pyromancer
566;00:38:06,513;00:38:10,582;place caches of wildfire
567;00:38:10,616;00:38:13,051;all over the city--
568;00:38:13,085;00:38:15,353;beneath the Sept
568;00:38:13,085;00:38:15,353;of Baelor
569;00:38:15,388;00:38:17,155;and the slums
569;00:38:15,388;00:38:17,155;of Flea Bottom.
570;00:38:17,223;00:38:20,493;Under houses,
570;00:38:17,223;00:38:20,493;stables, taverns.
571;00:38:20,527;00:38:23,863;Even beneath
571;00:38:20,527;00:38:23,863;the Red Keep itself.
572;00:38:25,632;00:38:28,001;Finally,
573;00:38:28,035;00:38:31,271;the day
573;00:38:28,035;00:38:31,271;of reckoning came.
574;00:38:31,306;00:38:33,674;Robert Baratheon
574;00:38:31,306;00:38:33,674;marched on the capital
575;00:38:33,708;00:38:35,776;after his victory
575;00:38:33,708;00:38:35,776;at the Trident.
576;00:38:35,811;00:38:38,212;But my father
576;00:38:35,811;00:38:38,212;arrived first
577;00:38:38,246;00:38:40,981;with the whole Lannister
577;00:38:38,246;00:38:40,981;army at his back,
578;00:38:41,016;00:38:45,419;promising to defend the city
578;00:38:41,016;00:38:45,419;against the rebels.
579;00:38:47,221;00:38:49,322;I knew my father
579;00:38:47,221;00:38:49,322;better than that.
580;00:38:49,357;00:38:52,692;He's never been one
580;00:38:49,357;00:38:52,692;to pick the losing side.
581;00:38:52,726;00:38:55,295;I told the Mad King
581;00:38:52,726;00:38:55,295;as much.
582;00:38:55,329;00:38:59,065;I urged him
582;00:38:55,329;00:38:59,065;to surrender peacefully.
583;00:38:59,099;00:39:02,301;But the king didn't
583;00:38:59,099;00:39:02,301;listen to me.
584;00:39:02,336;00:39:05,038;He didn't listen to Varys
584;00:39:02,336;00:39:05,038;who tried to warn him.
585;00:39:05,072;00:39:09,442;But he did listen
585;00:39:05,072;00:39:09,442;to Grand Maester Pycelle,
586;00:39:09,477;00:39:12,145;that grey, sunken cunt.
587;00:39:13,581;00:39:16,450;You can trust
587;00:39:13,581;00:39:16,450;the Lannisters, he said.
588;00:39:18,086;00:39:20,354;The Lannisters
588;00:39:18,086;00:39:20,354;have always been
589;00:39:20,421;00:39:22,623;true friends
589;00:39:20,421;00:39:22,623;of the crown.
590;00:39:24,792;00:39:27,494;So we opened the gates
591;00:39:27,528;00:39:29,763;and my father
591;00:39:27,528;00:39:29,763;sacked the city.
592;00:39:29,797;00:39:33,200;Once again,
592;00:39:29,797;00:39:33,200;I came to the king,
593;00:39:33,234;00:39:36,403;begging him to surrender.
594;00:39:40,074;00:39:42,509;He told me to...
595;00:39:42,543;00:39:45,078;bring him
595;00:39:42,543;00:39:45,078;my father's head.
596;00:39:46,414;00:39:48,481;Then he...
597;00:39:48,515;00:39:51,484;turned to his pyromancer.
598;00:39:51,518;00:39:54,286;Burn them all,
598;00:39:51,518;00:39:54,286;he said.
599;00:39:55,355;00:39:58,391;Burn them
599;00:39:55,355;00:39:58,391;in their homes.
600;00:39:58,425;00:40:00,560;Burn them
600;00:39:58,425;00:40:00,560;in their beds.
601;00:40:01,929;00:40:06,701;Tell me,
601;00:40:01,929;00:40:06,701;if your precious Renly
602;00:40:06,735;00:40:09,604;commanded you to kill
602;00:40:06,735;00:40:09,604;your own father
603;00:40:09,638;00:40:12,674;and stand by while
603;00:40:09,638;00:40:12,674;thousands of men,
604;00:40:12,708;00:40:14,943;women, and children
604;00:40:12,708;00:40:14,943;burned alive,
605;00:40:14,977;00:40:17,679;would you have done it?
606;00:40:17,713;00:40:19,514;Would you have
606;00:40:17,713;00:40:19,514;kept your oath then?
607;00:40:23,485;00:40:27,088;First, I killed
607;00:40:23,485;00:40:27,088;the pyromancer.
608;00:40:27,122;00:40:30,725;And then when the king
608;00:40:27,122;00:40:30,725;turned to flee,
609;00:40:30,759;00:40:34,262;I drove my sword
609;00:40:30,759;00:40:34,262;into his back.
610;00:40:35,498;00:40:37,999;Burn them all,
610;00:40:35,498;00:40:37,999;he kept saying.
611;00:40:38,034;00:40:40,001;Burn them all.
612;00:40:40,036;00:40:42,270;I don't think
612;00:40:40,036;00:40:42,270;he expected to die.
613;00:40:42,305;00:40:45,240;He-- he meant to...
614;00:40:46,776;00:40:49,277;burn with the rest of us
615;00:40:49,311;00:40:52,113;and rise again,
616;00:40:52,148;00:40:54,015;reborn as a dragon
617;00:40:54,050;00:40:55,950;to turn his enemies
617;00:40:54,050;00:40:55,950;to ash.
618;00:40:59,722;00:41:03,291;I slit his throat to make sure
618;00:40:59,722;00:41:03,291;that didn't happen.
619;00:41:07,396;00:41:11,165;That's where Ned Stark
619;00:41:07,396;00:41:11,165;found me.
620;00:41:11,199;00:41:13,400;If this is true...
621;00:41:15,036;00:41:16,904;why didn't you tell anyone?
622;00:41:18,907;00:41:20,774;Why didn't you tell
622;00:41:18,907;00:41:20,774;Lord Stark?
623;00:41:20,809;00:41:22,309;Stark?
624;00:41:22,344;00:41:24,812;You think
625;00:41:24,846;00:41:28,783;the honorable Ned Stark
626;00:41:28,817;00:41:32,087;wanted to hear my side?
627;00:41:32,121;00:41:34,822;He judged me guilty
628;00:41:34,857;00:41:37,258;the moment
628;00:41:34,857;00:41:37,258;he set eyes on me.
629;00:41:40,363;00:41:44,199;By what right
629;00:41:40,363;00:41:44,199;does the wolf
630;00:41:44,233;00:41:46,234;judge the lion?
631;00:41:47,537;00:41:49,104;By what right?
631;00:41:47,537;00:41:49,104;Help! Help!
632;00:41:49,138;00:41:50,772;The Kingslayer!
633;00:41:52,041;00:41:54,109;Jaime.
634;00:41:54,143;00:41:56,145;My name is Jaime.
635;00:41:59,350;00:42:01,718;Onion Knight.
636;00:42:01,752;00:42:03,687;Ser Onion Knight.
637;00:42:04,956;00:42:07,357;Princess?
637;00:42:04,956;00:42:07,357;Gods, what are you doing here?
638;00:42:07,391;00:42:09,859;Shh, you'll wake Bert.
638;00:42:07,391;00:42:09,859;Bert?
639;00:42:09,894;00:42:12,963;He's the fat one.
639;00:42:09,894;00:42:12,963;He's on guard duty tonight.
640;00:42:12,997;00:42:14,898;He likes to drink wine
640;00:42:12,997;00:42:14,898;and sleep a lot.
641;00:42:14,932;00:42:17,500;Go back to your room.
641;00:42:14,932;00:42:17,500;You're not supposed to be here.
642;00:42:17,534;00:42:19,669;If your father knew--
642;00:42:17,534;00:42:19,669;He said you were a traitor.
643;00:42:19,703;00:42:21,938;Are you?
644;00:42:21,972;00:42:24,540;I am, child.
645;00:42:24,574;00:42:26,509;I disobeyed my king,
645;00:42:24,574;00:42:26,509;your father,
646;00:42:26,543;00:42:28,377;and now I'm paying
646;00:42:26,543;00:42:28,377;the price.
647;00:42:28,412;00:42:30,913;I don't care.
647;00:42:28,412;00:42:30,913;You're my friend.
648;00:42:30,948;00:42:32,882;You must get bored
648;00:42:30,948;00:42:32,882;down here.
649;00:42:32,917;00:42:34,851;I brought you
649;00:42:32,917;00:42:34,851;something to read.
650;00:42:34,885;00:42:36,720;It's about Aegon
650;00:42:34,885;00:42:36,720;and his dragons.
651;00:42:36,754;00:42:40,189;Aegon used to live here.
651;00:42:36,754;00:42:40,189;Did you know that?
652;00:42:40,224;00:42:42,025;And the Targaryens built this castle.
652;00:42:40,224;00:42:42,025;Aye.
653;00:42:42,026;00:42:44,327;So they did.
653;00:42:42,026;00:42:44,327;You can hide the book under your cloak.
654;00:42:44,362;00:42:46,730;It's a good one.
654;00:42:44,362;00:42:46,730;I'll bring you more.
655;00:42:46,764;00:42:49,633;Thank you, my lady.
655;00:42:46,764;00:42:49,633;I'm sure it's a fine book,
656;00:42:49,667;00:42:51,068;but it's wasted on me.
657;00:42:51,102;00:42:53,570;Take it.
657;00:42:51,102;00:42:53,570;I have more.
658;00:42:54,706;00:42:57,307;My lady, I can't read
658;00:42:54,706;00:42:57,307;the words.
659;00:42:57,342;00:42:59,410;You can't?
660;00:42:59,444;00:43:02,146;I'll teach you. I'll come when
660;00:42:59,444;00:43:02,146;Bert's on duty and teach you.
661;00:43:02,180;00:43:04,014;No. No. No.
661;00:43:02,180;00:43:04,014;It's easy. It'll be fun.
662;00:43:04,049;00:43:06,183;Go. We can't.
662;00:43:04,049;00:43:06,183;Why not?
663;00:43:06,218;00:43:08,986;What will they do,
663;00:43:06,218;00:43:08,986;lock us in cells?
664;00:43:15,226;00:43:16,961;I wouldn't know
664;00:43:15,226;00:43:16,961;where to start.
665;00:43:16,995;00:43:18,729;At the beginning.
666;00:43:18,763;00:43:20,664;This word is Aegon.
667;00:43:20,699;00:43:24,802;When you see A, E, and G
667;00:43:20,699;00:43:24,802;together like that,
668;00:43:24,836;00:43:26,737;it sounds like egg.
669;00:43:26,771;00:43:28,673;And the title
669;00:43:26,771;00:43:28,673;of the whole book
670;00:43:28,707;00:43:30,875;is An History
670;00:43:28,707;00:43:30,875;of Aegon the Conqueror
671;00:43:30,909;00:43:33,077;and His Conquest
671;00:43:30,909;00:43:33,077;of Westeros.
672;00:43:45,290;00:43:46,924;It was a bitch
672;00:43:45,290;00:43:46,924;of a siege.
673;00:43:46,959;00:43:49,127;Mm, you were first
673;00:43:46,959;00:43:49,127;through the breach at Pyke?
674;00:43:49,161;00:43:52,630;The second.
674;00:43:49,161;00:43:52,630;Thoros of Myr went in alone,
675;00:43:52,664;00:43:54,832;waving that
675;00:43:52,664;00:43:54,832;flaming sword of his.
676;00:43:54,867;00:43:57,568;Thoros of Myr.
676;00:43:54,867;00:43:57,568;Bloody madman.
677;00:43:57,602;00:44:00,538;Robert knighted you
677;00:43:57,602;00:44:00,538;after the battle?
678;00:44:00,572;00:44:02,440;Proudest moment
678;00:44:00,572;00:44:02,440;of my life.
679;00:44:02,474;00:44:05,676;One knee in the dust,
679;00:44:02,474;00:44:05,676;the king's sword on my shoulder,
680;00:44:05,711;00:44:07,011;listening to the words.
681;00:44:07,045;00:44:10,748;In the name of the Warrior,
681;00:44:07,045;00:44:10,748;I charge you to be brave.
682;00:44:10,783;00:44:13,719;All I could think of
682;00:44:10,783;00:44:13,719;was how badly I had to piss.
683;00:44:15,021;00:44:17,656;In full plate metal
683;00:44:15,021;00:44:17,656;for 16 hours.
684;00:44:17,691;00:44:19,659;Never occurred to me
684;00:44:17,691;00:44:19,659;till the fighting was over.
685;00:44:19,693;00:44:22,896;I was very nearly the first man
685;00:44:19,693;00:44:22,896;knighted to piss on the king's boots.
686;00:44:24,732;00:44:26,967;Robert would have
686;00:44:24,732;00:44:26,967;laughed.
687;00:44:27,001;00:44:29,603;He was a good man,
687;00:44:27,001;00:44:29,603;a great warrior.
688;00:44:31,439;00:44:33,373;And a terrible king.
689;00:44:33,408;00:44:36,776;I burned away my years
689;00:44:33,408;00:44:36,776;fighting for terrible kings.
690;00:44:36,811;00:44:38,345;You swore an oath.
690;00:44:36,811;00:44:38,345;Yes.
691;00:44:38,379;00:44:40,247;And a man of honor
691;00:44:38,379;00:44:40,247;keeps his vows,
692;00:44:40,281;00:44:43,683;even if he's serving
692;00:44:40,281;00:44:43,683;a drunk or a lunatic.
693;00:44:43,718;00:44:46,286;Just once in my life
693;00:44:43,718;00:44:46,286;before it's over,
694;00:44:46,321;00:44:49,356;I want to know what it's like
694;00:44:46,321;00:44:49,356;to serve with pride,
695;00:44:49,390;00:44:52,526;to fight for someone
695;00:44:49,390;00:44:52,526;I believe in.
696;00:44:52,560;00:44:54,327;Do you believe in her?
697;00:44:57,164;00:44:58,999;With all my heart.
698;00:45:04,138;00:45:05,605;These are the ones?
699;00:45:05,640;00:45:07,774;Yes, khaleesi.
699;00:45:05,640;00:45:07,774;The officers.
700;00:45:43,444;00:45:45,846;All Unsullied boys
700;00:45:43,444;00:45:45,846;are given new names
701;00:45:45,880;00:45:47,480;when they are cut--
702;00:45:47,515;00:45:50,383;Grey Worm, Red Flea,
702;00:45:47,515;00:45:50,383;Black Rat.
703;00:45:50,418;00:45:53,186;Names that remind them
703;00:45:50,418;00:45:53,186;what they are--
704;00:45:53,221;00:45:55,722;vermin.
705;00:46:42,638;00:46:45,006;King Robert
705;00:46:42,638;00:46:45,006;wanted her dead.
706;00:46:45,041;00:46:46,274;Of course
706;00:46:45,041;00:46:46,274;he wanted her dead.
707;00:46:46,309;00:46:49,411;She's a Targaryen.
707;00:46:46,309;00:46:49,411;The last Targaryen.
708;00:46:49,446;00:46:52,548;I suppose no one on the small
708;00:46:49,446;00:46:52,548;council could speak sense to him.
709;00:46:52,582;00:46:55,117;I didn't sit on the small council.
709;00:46:52,582;00:46:55,117;No?
710;00:46:55,152;00:46:57,753;Doesn't the Lord Commander
710;00:46:55,152;00:46:57,753;of the Kingsguard traditionally--
711;00:46:57,788;00:46:59,655;Traditionally, yes,
711;00:46:57,788;00:46:59,655;but I killed a dozen
712;00:46:59,689;00:47:01,824;of Robert's friends
712;00:46:59,689;00:47:01,824;during his rebellion.
713;00:47:03,993;00:47:05,660;He didn't want advice
713;00:47:03,993;00:47:05,660;on how to govern
714;00:47:05,695;00:47:07,629;from a man who had fought
714;00:47:05,695;00:47:07,629;for the Mad King.
715;00:47:07,663;00:47:10,565;Can't say
715;00:47:07,663;00:47:10,565;I minded much.
716;00:47:10,600;00:47:12,767;I always hated
716;00:47:10,600;00:47:12,767;the politics.
717;00:47:12,802;00:47:14,736;Yeah, I imagine
717;00:47:12,802;00:47:14,736;I would, too.
718;00:47:14,770;00:47:17,205;Hours spent jabbering
718;00:47:14,770;00:47:17,205;about backstabbings
719;00:47:17,240;00:47:20,408;and betrayals the world over.
719;00:47:17,240;00:47:20,408;Mm-hmm.
720;00:47:23,579;00:47:25,480;Still, she'll have
720;00:47:23,579;00:47:25,480;to wade through that muck
721;00:47:25,514;00:47:27,716;if she wants to rule
721;00:47:25,514;00:47:27,716;the Seven Kingdoms.
722;00:47:27,750;00:47:29,818;She'll have good men
722;00:47:27,750;00:47:29,818;around her to advise her,
723;00:47:29,852;00:47:31,319;men with experience.
724;00:47:31,354;00:47:32,854;Which men do you
724;00:47:31,354;00:47:32,854;have in mind?
725;00:47:32,889;00:47:34,890;Forgive me, Ser Jorah,
725;00:47:32,889;00:47:34,890;for what I'm about to say,
726;00:47:34,924;00:47:38,494;but your reputation in Westeros
726;00:47:34,924;00:47:38,494;has suffered over the years.
727;00:47:38,528;00:47:40,930;It suffered for a reason.
728;00:47:40,964;00:47:42,731;I sold men into slavery.
729;00:47:42,766;00:47:44,600;I don't know
729;00:47:42,766;00:47:44,600;if your presence by her side
730;00:47:44,634;00:47:46,902;will help our cause
730;00:47:44,634;00:47:46,902;when we go home.
731;00:47:46,936;00:47:48,737;Our cause?
732;00:47:48,772;00:47:50,806;Forgive me, Ser Barristan,
732;00:47:48,772;00:47:50,806;but I was busy
733;00:47:50,841;00:47:53,042;defending the khaleesi against
733;00:47:50,841;00:47:53,042;King Robert's assassins
734;00:47:53,076;00:47:54,877;while you were still
734;00:47:53,076;00:47:54,877;bowing to the man.
735;00:47:54,911;00:47:57,913;We both want her to rule.
735;00:47:54,911;00:47:57,913;Am I wrong?
736;00:47:57,948;00:48:00,549;You only joined us
736;00:47:57,948;00:48:00,549;a few days ago.
737;00:48:00,583;00:48:02,717;I can't speak
737;00:48:00,583;00:48:02,717;to your intentions.
738;00:48:02,752;00:48:04,886;If we're truly
738;00:48:02,752;00:48:04,886;her loyal servants,
739;00:48:04,920;00:48:07,722;we will do whatever
739;00:48:04,920;00:48:07,722;needs to be done,
740;00:48:07,756;00:48:10,358;no matter the cost,
740;00:48:07,756;00:48:10,358;no matter our pride.
741;00:48:10,392;00:48:12,960;You're not
741;00:48:10,392;00:48:12,960;Lord Commander here.
742;00:48:12,995;00:48:15,563;You're just another exile.
743;00:48:15,597;00:48:17,665;And I take my orders
743;00:48:15,597;00:48:17,665;from the queen.
744;00:48:25,840;00:48:28,675;- Come to bed.
744;00:48:25,840;00:48:28,675;You were right.
745;00:48:29,811;00:48:31,645;The Karstarks are gone.
746;00:48:32,613;00:48:34,848;Almost half our forces.
747;00:48:34,882;00:48:38,385;Tywin Lannister knows what he
747;00:48:34,882;00:48:38,385;needs to do to make us unravel.
748;00:48:38,419;00:48:41,288;Nothing.
749;00:48:41,323;00:48:43,457;Only wait.
750;00:48:43,491;00:48:45,993;Don't let him.
751;00:48:46,027;00:48:48,128;What can I do?
752;00:48:48,163;00:48:49,596;Attack King's Landing?
753;00:48:49,631;00:48:51,765;There's nothing
753;00:48:49,631;00:48:51,765;he'd like better.
754;00:48:51,799;00:48:53,800;He'd crush us
754;00:48:51,799;00:48:53,800;in a day.
755;00:48:54,836;00:48:55,969;We could ride north.
756;00:48:56,003;00:48:58,672;Take your land back
756;00:48:56,003;00:48:58,672;from the Greyjoys.
757;00:48:58,706;00:49:01,975;Wait out the winter.
757;00:48:58,706;00:49:01,975;Winter could last five years.
758;00:49:02,010;00:49:03,376;Once my bannermen
758;00:49:02,010;00:49:03,376;are home again,
759;00:49:03,411;00:49:06,180;sitting by the fire,
759;00:49:03,411;00:49:06,180;surrounded by their families,
760;00:49:06,214;00:49:09,283;warm and safe,
760;00:49:06,214;00:49:09,283;they'll never ride south again.
761;00:49:09,317;00:49:11,452;When I gathered
761;00:49:09,317;00:49:11,452;my lords together,
762;00:49:11,487;00:49:13,388;we had a purpose,
762;00:49:11,487;00:49:13,388;a mission.
763;00:49:13,422;00:49:16,190;Now we're like a band
763;00:49:13,422;00:49:16,190;of bickering children.
764;00:49:18,561;00:49:20,462;Give them a new purpose.
765;00:49:20,496;00:49:22,197;What?
766;00:49:23,699;00:49:25,900;Oh, I don't know.
767;00:49:25,935;00:49:28,436;I don't even know
767;00:49:25,935;00:49:28,436;where Winterfell is.
768;00:49:31,106;00:49:33,041;Here.
769;00:49:36,279;00:49:39,848;And we're here.
769;00:49:36,279;00:49:39,848;King's Landing--
770;00:49:46,723;00:49:48,257;What is it?
771;00:49:51,494;00:49:54,663;I can't force them
771;00:49:51,494;00:49:54,663;to meet us in the field
772;00:49:54,697;00:49:57,098;and I can't attack them
772;00:49:54,697;00:49:57,098;where they're strongest,
773;00:49:57,132;00:50:00,035;but I can attack them
773;00:49:57,132;00:50:00,035;where they're not.
774;00:50:01,204;00:50:04,072;And Casterly Rock
774;00:50:01,204;00:50:04,072;can't run away.
775;00:50:05,341;00:50:08,377;I'm going to take
775;00:50:05,341;00:50:08,377;their home away from them.
776;00:50:09,646;00:50:11,814;Can you do it?
777;00:50:11,848;00:50:14,851;I need men to replace the Karstarks
777;00:50:11,848;00:50:14,851;who marched home.
778;00:50:14,885;00:50:17,487;There is only one person
778;00:50:14,885;00:50:17,487;in this kingdom
779;00:50:17,521;00:50:20,723;with that kind of army who hasn't
779;00:50:17,521;00:50:20,723;already sided with the Lannisters.
780;00:50:22,159;00:50:24,860;The man whose daughter
780;00:50:22,159;00:50:24,860;I was supposed to marry--
781;00:50:25,896;00:50:27,796;Walder Frey.
782;00:50:36,672;00:50:38,940;He's such
782;00:50:36,672;00:50:38,940;a splendid fighter.
783;00:50:38,974;00:50:42,310;Do you have any idea
783;00:50:38,974;00:50:42,310;when we might...
784;00:50:42,345;00:50:45,981;I'll plant the seed
784;00:50:42,345;00:50:45,981;as soon as Joffrey and I are married.
785;00:50:46,015;00:50:47,482;It should grow quickly.
786;00:50:47,516;00:50:49,150;Joffrey won't let me leave.
787;00:50:49,185;00:50:51,920;He's got too many reasons
787;00:50:49,185;00:50:51,920;to keep me here.
788;00:50:51,954;00:50:55,290;And only one
788;00:50:51,954;00:50:55,290;to let you go.
789;00:50:55,324;00:50:57,525;Because it will
789;00:50:55,324;00:50:57,525;please me.
790;00:50:57,560;00:50:59,594;Squire!
791;00:51:03,166;00:51:04,833;Well fought, ser.
792;00:51:04,867;00:51:07,635;That was no fight.
792;00:51:04,867;00:51:07,635;I don't know you.
793;00:51:07,670;00:51:10,004;Olyver,
793;00:51:07,670;00:51:10,004;if it please you.
794;00:51:12,174;00:51:15,042;I should like to see you spar with
794;00:51:12,174;00:51:15,042;a proper partner, ser.
795;00:51:23,085;00:51:24,618;How did you know?
796;00:51:24,653;00:51:26,554;Know what?
797;00:51:27,889;00:51:29,724;That I wanted to.
798;00:51:29,758;00:51:31,625;My lord...
799;00:51:35,663;00:51:37,331;I'll have you know
799;00:51:35,663;00:51:37,331;I'm to be married soon
800;00:51:37,365;00:51:40,434;and even my intended
800;00:51:37,365;00:51:40,434;hasn't the slightest notion.
801;00:51:40,468;00:51:43,571;They rarely do,
801;00:51:40,468;00:51:43,571;in my experience.
802;00:51:43,605;00:51:45,973;You have a good deal
802;00:51:43,605;00:51:45,973;of experience, do you?
803;00:51:46,908;00:51:49,076;With the husbands.
804;00:51:57,920;00:52:00,255;That didn't take long.
805;00:52:00,290;00:52:02,492;Well, it took long enough.
806;00:52:04,061;00:52:07,030;It seems our Knight of Flowers
806;00:52:04,061;00:52:07,030;is engaged to be wed.
807;00:52:07,064;00:52:08,865;Is he?
808;00:52:08,899;00:52:11,200;And...
809;00:52:11,235;00:52:13,036;who's the lucky girl?
810;00:52:13,070;00:52:16,573;She may not be the grandest
810;00:52:13,070;00:52:16,573;ship in the world
811;00:52:16,607;00:52:19,075;or the fastest,
812;00:52:19,110;00:52:21,278;but she's mine.
813;00:52:24,816;00:52:26,750;I've always wanted a ship.
814;00:52:26,784;00:52:28,919;Now I want a dozen.
815;00:52:28,954;00:52:31,589;Strange, isn't it?
815;00:52:28,954;00:52:31,589;What is?
816;00:52:31,623;00:52:33,792;It doesn't matter
816;00:52:31,623;00:52:33,792;what we want,
817;00:52:33,826;00:52:35,627;once we get it,
818;00:52:35,661;00:52:37,396;then we want
818;00:52:35,661;00:52:37,396;something else.
819;00:52:40,166;00:52:42,868;Your hair is different.
820;00:52:42,902;00:52:44,536;Is it?
821;00:52:44,570;00:52:46,171;Lady Margaery
821;00:52:44,570;00:52:46,171;wears it that way.
822;00:52:46,205;00:52:48,607;Many ladies
822;00:52:46,205;00:52:48,607;wear it this way.
823;00:52:48,641;00:52:50,376;I have good news.
824;00:52:50,410;00:52:52,511;I'll be leaving
824;00:52:50,410;00:52:52,511;the city soon.
825;00:52:52,545;00:52:54,012;You still want me
825;00:52:52,545;00:52:54,012;to come with you?
826;00:52:54,047;00:52:56,248;It's not a question
826;00:52:54,047;00:52:56,248;of what I want.
827;00:52:56,282;00:52:58,484;It's what you want.
828;00:52:58,518;00:52:59,718;You want to go home,
828;00:52:58,518;00:52:59,718;don't you?
829;00:52:59,752;00:53:02,187;Of course.
829;00:52:59,752;00:53:02,187;More than anything.
830;00:53:04,357;00:53:07,759;But maybe it would
830;00:53:04,357;00:53:07,759;be better to wait.
831;00:53:07,794;00:53:10,596;I've been thinking
831;00:53:07,794;00:53:10,596;how dangerous it would be.
832;00:53:10,630;00:53:13,498;Not just for me,
832;00:53:10,630;00:53:13,498;but for you.
833;00:53:13,533;00:53:14,799;You've been so kind.
834;00:53:14,834;00:53:18,002;I'd feel terrible if anything
834;00:53:14,834;00:53:18,002;happened to you.
835;00:53:19,138;00:53:21,372;I can't tell you
835;00:53:19,138;00:53:21,372;how touched I am
836;00:53:21,407;00:53:24,642;by your concern
836;00:53:21,407;00:53:24,642;for my welfare.
837;00:53:24,677;00:53:27,479;I hope you know that
837;00:53:24,677;00:53:27,479;I'm your friend, Sansa.
838;00:53:27,546;00:53:29,547;Your true friend.
839;00:53:29,582;00:53:31,282;I do, Lord Baelish.
840;00:53:31,317;00:53:33,986;Petyr.
840;00:53:31,317;00:53:33,986;Petyr.
841;00:53:34,020;00:53:36,121;If you wish to stay,
842;00:53:36,155;00:53:39,157;then of course
842;00:53:36,155;00:53:39,157;you will stay.
843;00:53:44,063;00:53:46,431;We'll speak again
843;00:53:44,063;00:53:46,431;when I return.
844;00:53:59,444;00:54:01,578;You're late.
845;00:54:01,612;00:54:04,414;What's she doing here?
846;00:54:04,449;00:54:06,483;Our business
846;00:54:04,449;00:54:06,483;concerns her, too.
847;00:54:06,517;00:54:08,351;Sit.
848;00:54:10,355;00:54:11,955;You'll be pleased to learn
849;00:54:11,990;00:54:15,058;that after one conversation
849;00:54:11,990;00:54:15,058;with Olenna Tyrell,
850;00:54:15,092;00:54:17,126;I've saved the crown
851;00:54:17,161;00:54:19,963;hundreds of thousands
851;00:54:17,161;00:54:19,963;on this wedding.
852;00:54:19,997;00:54:21,031;Never mind that now.
853;00:54:21,065;00:54:22,585;We have something
853;00:54:21,065;00:54:22,585;important to discuss.
854;00:54:22,600;00:54:25,035;I'm Master of Coin.
854;00:54:22,600;00:54:25,035;Saving money is important.
855;00:54:25,937;00:54:27,371;Stop that.
856;00:54:27,405;00:54:29,339;You're making me
856;00:54:27,405;00:54:29,339;uncomfortable.
857;00:54:29,374;00:54:32,343;Your sister has learned that
857;00:54:29,374;00:54:32,343;your new friends the Tyrells
858;00:54:32,378;00:54:35,381;are plotting to marry
858;00:54:32,378;00:54:35,381;Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.
859;00:54:35,415;00:54:37,183;Very well.
860;00:54:37,217;00:54:39,251;She's a lovely girl.
861;00:54:39,286;00:54:41,286;Missing some of Loras'
861;00:54:39,286;00:54:41,286;favorite bits,
862;00:54:41,321;00:54:43,122;but I'm sure
862;00:54:41,321;00:54:43,122;they'll make do.
863;00:54:43,156;00:54:45,691;Your jokes are not appreciated.
863;00:54:43,156;00:54:45,691;It wasn't my best, but--
864;00:54:45,725;00:54:48,827;I bring them into the royal fold
864;00:54:45,725;00:54:48,827;and this is how they repay me,
865;00:54:48,862;00:54:52,331;by trying to steal the key to
865;00:54:48,862;00:54:52,331;the North out from under me.
866;00:54:52,365;00:54:54,033;Sansa is the key
866;00:54:52,365;00:54:54,033;to the North?
867;00:54:54,067;00:54:56,435;I seem to remember
867;00:54:54,067;00:54:56,435;she has an older brother.
868;00:54:56,469;00:54:58,470;The Karstarks
868;00:54:56,469;00:54:58,470;have marched home.
869;00:54:58,505;00:55:01,440;The young wolf has lost half his army.
869;00:54:58,505;00:55:01,440;His days are numbered.
870;00:55:01,475;00:55:04,577;Theon Greyjoy murdered
870;00:55:01,475;00:55:04,577;both his brothers.
871;00:55:04,611;00:55:07,947;That makes Sansa Stark
871;00:55:04,611;00:55:07,947;the heir to Winterfell.
872;00:55:07,982;00:55:11,818;And I am not about
872;00:55:07,982;00:55:11,818;to hand her over to the Tyrells.
873;00:55:11,853;00:55:14,154;The Tyrell army is helping
873;00:55:11,853;00:55:14,154;us to win this war.
874;00:55:14,189;00:55:16,957;Do you really think
874;00:55:14,189;00:55:16,957;it's wise to refuse them?
875;00:55:16,992;00:55:18,792;There's nothing to refuse.
875;00:55:16,992;00:55:18,792;This is a plot.
876;00:55:18,827;00:55:21,629;Plots are not
876;00:55:18,827;00:55:21,629;public knowledge.
877;00:55:21,663;00:55:23,397;And the Tyrells
877;00:55:21,663;00:55:23,397;won't carry this one out
878;00:55:23,432;00:55:25,599;until after
878;00:55:23,432;00:55:25,599;Joffrey's wedding.
879;00:55:25,634;00:55:29,403;We need to act first
879;00:55:25,634;00:55:29,403;and kill this union in its crib.
880;00:55:29,437;00:55:30,838;And how do we do that?
881;00:55:30,872;00:55:33,139;We find Sansa Stark
881;00:55:30,872;00:55:33,139;a different husband.
882;00:55:33,174;00:55:35,775;Wonderful.
882;00:55:33,174;00:55:35,775;Yes, it is.
883;00:55:43,351;00:55:44,918;You can't mean it.
884;00:55:44,952;00:55:46,419;I can and I do.
885;00:55:46,454;00:55:49,556;Joffrey has made this
885;00:55:46,454;00:55:49,556;poor girl's life miserable
886;00:55:49,590;00:55:51,625;since the day he took
886;00:55:49,590;00:55:51,625;her father's head.
887;00:55:51,659;00:55:54,694;Now she's finally free of
887;00:55:51,659;00:55:54,694;him and you give her to me?
888;00:55:54,728;00:55:56,429;That's cruel even for you.
889;00:55:56,464;00:55:58,331;Do you intend
889;00:55:56,464;00:55:58,331;on mistreating her?
890;00:55:58,366;00:56:00,300;The girl's happiness
890;00:55:58,366;00:56:00,300;is not my concern,
891;00:56:00,335;00:56:02,569;nor should it be yours.
891;00:56:00,335;00:56:02,569;She's a child!
892;00:56:02,604;00:56:05,473;She's flowered, I assure you.
892;00:56:02,604;00:56:05,473;She and I have discussed it at length.
893;00:56:05,507;00:56:09,010;There, you see? You will wed her,
893;00:56:05,507;00:56:09,010;bed her, and put a child in her.
894;00:56:09,044;00:56:12,080;Surely you're capable of that.
894;00:56:09,044;00:56:12,080;And if I refuse?
895;00:56:12,115;00:56:14,784;You wanted to be rewarded
895;00:56:12,115;00:56:14,784;for your valor in battle.
896;00:56:14,818;00:56:18,821;Sansa Stark is a finer reward than
896;00:56:14,818;00:56:18,821;you could ever dare hope for.
897;00:56:18,855;00:56:21,357;And it is past time
897;00:56:18,855;00:56:21,357;you were wed.
898;00:56:21,391;00:56:24,226;I was wed.
899;00:56:24,261;00:56:26,829;Or don't you remember?
900;00:56:28,265;00:56:30,399;Only too well.
901;00:56:30,434;00:56:33,803;You should be thanking
901;00:56:30,434;00:56:33,803;the gods for this.
