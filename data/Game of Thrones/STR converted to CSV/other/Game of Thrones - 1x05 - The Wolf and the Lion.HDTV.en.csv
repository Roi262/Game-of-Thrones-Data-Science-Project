3;00:02:20,893;00:02:22,970;Does Ser Hugh have
3;00:02:20,893;00:02:22,970;any family in the capital?
4;00:02:22,995;00:02:24,195;No.
5;00:02:26,282;00:02:29,150;I stood vigil for him myself
5;00:02:26,282;00:02:29,150;last night.
6;00:02:29,843;00:02:32,177;He had no one else.
7;00:02:33,041;00:02:35,242;He'd never worn
7;00:02:33,041;00:02:35,242;this armor before.
8;00:02:35,276;00:02:37,511;Bad luck for him--
9;00:02:37,545;00:02:39,713;going against
9;00:02:37,545;00:02:39,713;the Mountain.
10;00:02:39,747;00:02:42,114;Who determines
10;00:02:39,747;00:02:42,114;the draw?
11;00:02:42,149;00:02:44,750;All the knights
11;00:02:42,149;00:02:44,750;draw straws, Lord Stark.
12;00:02:44,785;00:02:46,418;Aye.
13;00:02:46,453;00:02:49,655;But who holds
13;00:02:46,453;00:02:49,655;the straws?
14;00:02:49,690;00:02:52,225;You've done
14;00:02:49,690;00:02:52,225;good work, sisters.
15;00:02:57,832;00:03:00,868;Life is strange.
15;00:02:57,832;00:03:00,868;Not so many years ago
16;00:03:00,903;00:03:02,871;we fought as enemies
16;00:03:00,903;00:03:02,871;at the trident.
17;00:03:02,905;00:03:05,707;I'm glad we never met
17;00:03:02,905;00:03:05,707;on the field, Ser Barristan.
18;00:03:05,741;00:03:07,642;As is my wife.
19;00:03:07,677;00:03:09,678;I don't think the widow's life
19;00:03:07,677;00:03:09,678;would suit her.
20;00:03:09,713;00:03:12,047;You're too modest.
21;00:03:12,081;00:03:14,450;I've seen you cut down
21;00:03:12,081;00:03:14,450;a dozen great knights.
22;00:03:14,484;00:03:16,118;My father once told me
23;00:03:16,152;00:03:18,353;you were the best
23;00:03:16,152;00:03:18,353;he'd ever seen.
24;00:03:18,387;00:03:21,223;I never knew the man to be
24;00:03:18,387;00:03:21,223;wrong about matters of combat.
25;00:03:21,257;00:03:23,559;He was a fine man,
25;00:03:21,257;00:03:23,559;your father.
26;00:03:24,861;00:03:26,962;What the Mad King did to him
26;00:03:24,861;00:03:26,962;was a terrible crime.
27;00:03:26,997;00:03:28,564;And that lad--
28;00:03:28,598;00:03:30,633;he was a squire
28;00:03:28,598;00:03:30,633;until a few months ago.
29;00:03:30,668;00:03:33,269;How could he afford
29;00:03:30,668;00:03:33,269;a new suit of armor?
30;00:03:33,303;00:03:35,771;Perhaps Lord Arryn
30;00:03:33,303;00:03:35,771;left him some money?
31;00:03:37,841;00:03:39,942;I hear the King wants
31;00:03:37,841;00:03:39,942;to joust today.
32;00:03:39,976;00:03:41,643;Yes, that will
32;00:03:39,976;00:03:41,643;never happen.
33;00:03:41,678;00:03:44,479;Robert tends to do
33;00:03:41,678;00:03:44,479;what he wants.
34;00:03:44,514;00:03:47,149;If the King got what
34;00:03:44,514;00:03:47,149;he wanted all the time,
35;00:03:47,183;00:03:49,785;he'd still be fighting
35;00:03:47,183;00:03:49,785;a damned rebellion.
36;00:03:54,524;00:03:57,259;It's made too small,
36;00:03:54,524;00:03:57,259;Your Grace. It won't go.
37;00:03:57,294;00:03:59,595;Your mother was
37;00:03:57,294;00:03:59,595;a dumb whore
38;00:03:59,630;00:04:02,031;with a fat ass.
38;00:03:59,630;00:04:02,031;Did you know that?
39;00:04:04,701;00:04:08,170;Look at this idiot!
39;00:04:04,701;00:04:08,170;One ball and no brains.
40;00:04:08,205;00:04:10,940;He can't even put a man's
40;00:04:08,205;00:04:10,940;armor on him properly.
41;00:04:10,974;00:04:13,242;You're too fat
41;00:04:10,974;00:04:13,242;for your armor.
42;00:04:13,276;00:04:16,245;Fat?
42;00:04:13,276;00:04:16,245;Fat, is it?
43;00:04:16,280;00:04:19,482;Is that how you speak
43;00:04:16,280;00:04:19,482;to your King?
44;00:04:26,590;00:04:28,524;That was funny, is it?
45;00:04:30,627;00:04:32,261;No, Your Grace.
46;00:04:32,296;00:04:35,431;No?
46;00:04:32,296;00:04:35,431;You don't like the Hand's joke?
47;00:04:36,400;00:04:38,267;You're torturing
47;00:04:36,400;00:04:38,267;the poor boy.
48;00:04:38,301;00:04:41,103;You heard the Hand.
48;00:04:38,301;00:04:41,103;The King's too fat for his armor.
49;00:04:41,138;00:04:44,240;Go find the breastplate
49;00:04:41,138;00:04:44,240;stretcher-- now!
50;00:04:45,609;00:04:49,312;The breastplate stretcher?
51;00:04:49,346;00:04:51,680;How long before
51;00:04:49,346;00:04:51,680;he figures it out?
52;00:04:51,715;00:04:53,409;Maybe you should
52;00:04:51,715;00:04:53,409;have one invented.
53;00:04:53,434;00:04:54,734;All right, all right.
54;00:04:54,751;00:04:57,519;But you watch me out there--
54;00:04:54,751;00:04:57,519;I still know how to point a Lance.
55;00:04:57,554;00:05:00,657;You have no business jousting.
55;00:04:57,554;00:05:00,657;Leave that for the young men.
56;00:05:00,691;00:05:04,027;Why, because I'm king?
56;00:05:00,691;00:05:04,027;Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!
57;00:05:04,061;00:05:06,429;And who's going to hit you back?
57;00:05:04,061;00:05:06,429;Anybody who can.
58;00:05:06,463;00:05:09,532;And the last man in his saddle--
58;00:05:06,463;00:05:09,532;Will be you.
59;00:05:09,566;00:05:11,701;There's not a man
59;00:05:09,566;00:05:11,701;in the Seven Kingdoms
60;00:05:11,735;00:05:13,669;would risk hurting you.
61;00:05:13,704;00:05:16,605;Are you telling me those
61;00:05:13,704;00:05:16,605;cowards would let me win?
62;00:05:16,640;00:05:19,208;Aye.
63;00:05:23,580;00:05:26,081;Drink.
63;00:05:23,580;00:05:26,081;I'm not thirsty.
64;00:05:26,115;00:05:28,683;Drink.
64;00:05:26,115;00:05:28,683;Your King commands it.
65;00:05:32,454;00:05:34,356;Gods,
66;00:05:34,390;00:05:36,891;too fat for my armor.
67;00:05:37,860;00:05:40,461;Your squire...
67;00:05:37,860;00:05:40,461;A Lannister boy?
68;00:05:40,495;00:05:42,930;Mm. A bloody idiot,
69;00:05:42,964;00:05:45,065;but Cersei insisted.
70;00:05:45,099;00:05:48,535;I have Jon Arryn
70;00:05:45,099;00:05:48,535;to thank for her.
71;00:05:48,569;00:05:51,705;Cersei Lannister will make
71;00:05:48,569;00:05:51,705;a good match, she told me.
72;00:05:51,740;00:05:54,609;You'll need her father
72;00:05:51,740;00:05:54,609;on your side.
73;00:05:56,312;00:05:59,882;I thought being King meant I
73;00:05:56,312;00:05:59,882;could do whatever I wanted.
74;00:06:03,387;00:06:05,455;Enough of this.
74;00:06:03,387;00:06:05,455;Let's go watch 'em ride.
75;00:06:05,489;00:06:08,224;At least I can smell
75;00:06:05,489;00:06:08,224;someone else's blood.
76;00:06:08,258;00:06:10,126;Robert?
76;00:06:08,258;00:06:10,126;What?
77;00:06:11,028;00:06:13,929;Oh.
78;00:06:13,964;00:06:16,966;An inspiring sight
78;00:06:13,964;00:06:16,966;for the people, eh?
79;00:06:17,000;00:06:19,902;Come, bow before your King!
79;00:06:17,000;00:06:19,902;Bow, you shits!
80;00:06:33,484;00:06:36,986;Where's Arya?
80;00:06:33,484;00:06:36,986;At her dancing lessons.
81;00:06:39,223;00:06:41,424;The knight of the flowers.
82;00:06:48,198;00:06:50,533;Thank you, Ser Loras.
83;00:07:21,331;00:07:23,666;Don't let Ser Gregor
83;00:07:21,331;00:07:23,666;hurt him.
84;00:07:23,700;00:07:27,103;Hey.
84;00:07:23,700;00:07:27,103;I can't watch.
85;00:07:29,539;00:07:32,040;100 gold dragons
85;00:07:29,539;00:07:32,040;on the Mountain.
86;00:07:32,071;00:07:33,121;I'll take that bet.
87;00:07:33,146;00:07:35,011;Now what will I buy
87;00:07:33,146;00:07:35,011;with 100 gold dragons?
88;00:07:35,544;00:07:38,012;A dozen barrels
88;00:07:35,544;00:07:38,012;of Dornish wine?
89;00:07:38,046;00:07:41,081;Or a girl from
89;00:07:38,046;00:07:41,081;the pleasure houses of Lys?
90;00:07:41,115;00:07:42,370;Or you could even
90;00:07:41,115;00:07:42,370;buy a friend.
91;00:07:42,723;00:07:44,646;He's going to die.
92;00:07:44,685;00:07:47,287;Ser Loras rides well.
93;00:08:17,352;00:08:19,219;Such a shame,
93;00:08:17,352;00:08:19,219;Littlefinger.
94;00:08:19,253;00:08:21,554;It would have been so nice
94;00:08:19,253;00:08:21,554;for you to have a friend.
95;00:08:23,023;00:08:24,824;And tell me, Lord Renly,
96;00:08:24,858;00:08:27,360;when will you be having
96;00:08:24,858;00:08:27,360;your friend?
97;00:08:37,839;00:08:39,674;Loras knew his mare
97;00:08:37,839;00:08:39,674;was in heat.
98;00:08:39,708;00:08:41,442;Quite crafty, really.
99;00:08:41,477;00:08:43,778;Ser Loras would
99;00:08:41,477;00:08:43,778;never do that.
100;00:08:43,813;00:08:45,141;There's no honor in tricks.
101;00:08:45,166;00:08:46,951;No honor and quite
101;00:08:45,166;00:08:46,951;a bit of gold.
102;00:08:48,918;00:08:51,587;Sword!
103;00:09:16,814;00:09:18,915;Leave him be!
104;00:09:40,872;00:09:44,141;Stop this madness
104;00:09:40,872;00:09:44,141;in the name of your King!
105;00:09:49,813;00:09:52,081;Let him go!
106;00:10:00,524;00:10:02,993;I owe you my life, Ser.
107;00:10:03,027;00:10:05,295;I'm no Ser.
108;00:10:28,784;00:10:30,151;Remove his hood.

126;00:11:11,964;00:11:13,731;Unless a Shadowcat
126;00:11:11,964;00:11:13,731;ate me first.
127;00:11:13,765;00:11:16,934;Shadowcats and hill tribes are
127;00:11:13,765;00:11:16,934;the least of your concerns.
128;00:11:18,102;00:11:21,104;Ah, the eastern road.
129;00:11:21,138;00:11:23,340;We're going to the Vale.
130;00:11:23,374;00:11:25,375;You're taking me
130;00:11:23,374;00:11:25,375;to your sister's
131;00:11:25,409;00:11:27,310;to answer for my
131;00:11:25,409;00:11:27,310;imagined crimes.
132;00:11:27,345;00:11:30,747;Tell me, Lady Stark, when was
132;00:11:27,345;00:11:30,747;the last time you saw your sister?
133;00:11:30,781;00:11:32,849;Five years ago.
134;00:11:32,884;00:11:35,285;She's changed.
135;00:11:35,320;00:11:37,287;She was always
135;00:11:35,320;00:11:37,287;a bit touched, but now--
136;00:11:37,322;00:11:38,989;you might as well
136;00:11:37,322;00:11:38,989;kill me here.
137;00:11:39,023;00:11:41,959;I am not a murderer, Lannister.
137;00:11:39,023;00:11:41,959;Neither am I!
138;00:11:41,993;00:11:44,728;I had nothing to do with the
138;00:11:41,993;00:11:44,728;attempt on your son's life.
139;00:11:44,763;00:11:46,830;The dagger found--
139;00:11:44,763;00:11:46,830;What sort of imbecile
140;00:11:46,865;00:11:48,532;arms an assassin
140;00:11:46,865;00:11:48,532;with his own blade?
141;00:11:48,566;00:11:50,767;Should I gag him?
141;00:11:48,566;00:11:50,767;Why?
142;00:11:50,801;00:11:52,669;Am I starting
142;00:11:50,801;00:11:52,669;to make sense?
143;00:11:52,703;00:11:55,638;Rodrik!
144;00:11:59,309;00:12:01,310;My Lady, this way.
145;00:12:17,296;00:12:19,097;Untie me.
146;00:12:19,131;00:12:21,499;If I die, what's the point?
147;00:12:28,307;00:12:29,607;Ah!
148;00:13:12,950;00:13:14,617;Rodrik?
149;00:13:14,652;00:13:16,319;I'll be fine, My Lady.
150;00:13:16,353;00:13:19,055;There's no need
150;00:13:16,353;00:13:19,055;to bloody yourself.
151;00:13:20,524;00:13:22,291;Your first?
152;00:13:23,627;00:13:25,561;You need a woman.
153;00:13:25,595;00:13:28,531;Nothing like a woman
153;00:13:25,595;00:13:28,531;after a fight.
154;00:13:30,401;00:13:32,469;I'm willing if she is.
155;00:13:44,950;00:13:46,784;Bran.
156;00:13:46,818;00:13:48,786;The Iron Islands.
157;00:13:48,820;00:13:50,287;A Kraken.
158;00:13:50,322;00:13:53,056;We do not sow.
159;00:13:53,091;00:13:55,225;Lords?
159;00:13:53,091;00:13:55,225;The Greyjoys.
160;00:13:55,260;00:13:56,893;Famed for their skills
160;00:13:55,260;00:13:56,893;at archery,
161;00:13:56,927;00:13:58,728;navigation
161;00:13:56,927;00:13:58,728;and lovemaking.
162;00:14:00,464;00:14:02,731;And failed rebellions.
163;00:14:04,367;00:14:06,235;A stag--
164;00:14:06,269;00:14:08,871;a crowned stag
164;00:14:06,269;00:14:08,871;now that Robert's King.
165;00:14:08,905;00:14:12,107;Good.
165;00:14:08,905;00:14:12,107;Words: Ours is the fury.
166;00:14:12,142;00:14:14,811;Lords: The Baratheons.
166;00:14:12,142;00:14:14,811;Mm-hmm.
167;00:14:14,845;00:14:16,846;The Westerlands.
168;00:14:16,881;00:14:18,949;Sigil: A lion.
168;00:14:16,881;00:14:18,949;Mmm.
169;00:14:18,983;00:14:21,356;A Lannister
169;00:14:18,983;00:14:21,356;always pays his debts.
170;00:14:21,381;00:14:22,419;No.
171;00:14:22,528;00:14:24,757;A common saying, but not
171;00:14:22,528;00:14:24,757;their official motto.
172;00:14:25,124;00:14:27,826;The Lannisters.
173;00:14:27,860;00:14:30,762;We're still on their words.
173;00:14:27,860;00:14:30,762;I don't know them.
174;00:14:30,796;00:14:32,630;You do know them.
174;00:14:30,796;00:14:32,630;Think.
175;00:14:32,664;00:14:35,066;Unbowed, unbent,
175;00:14:32,664;00:14:35,066;unbroken.
176;00:14:35,100;00:14:37,734;That's House Martell.
176;00:14:35,100;00:14:37,734;Righteous in wrath.
177;00:14:37,769;00:14:41,738;House Hornwood.
177;00:14:37,769;00:14:41,738;Family, duty, honor.
178;00:14:41,773;00:14:43,740;Those are Tully words--
178;00:14:41,773;00:14:43,740;your mother's.
179;00:14:43,774;00:14:46,876;Are we playing a game?
179;00:14:43,774;00:14:46,876;Family, duty, honor...
180;00:14:46,910;00:14:49,545;Is that the right order?
180;00:14:46,910;00:14:49,545;You know it is.
181;00:14:49,579;00:14:51,914;Family comes first?
182;00:14:51,948;00:14:54,550;Your mother had
182;00:14:51,948;00:14:54,550;to leave Winterfell
183;00:14:54,584;00:14:56,218;to protect the family.
184;00:14:56,252;00:14:58,520;How can she protect
184;00:14:56,252;00:14:58,520;the family
185;00:14:58,555;00:15:01,223;if she's not
185;00:14:58,555;00:15:01,223;with her family?
186;00:15:01,257;00:15:04,660;Your mother
186;00:15:01,257;00:15:04,660;sat by your bed
187;00:15:04,695;00:15:07,363;for three weeks
187;00:15:04,695;00:15:07,363;while you slept--
188;00:15:07,397;00:15:09,832;and then she left!
189;00:15:11,669;00:15:12,901;When you were born,
189;00:15:11,669;00:15:12,901;I was the one
190;00:15:12,926;00:15:14,319;who pulled you
190;00:15:12,926;00:15:14,319;from your mother.
191;00:15:15,740;00:15:18,376;I placed you in her arms.
192;00:15:18,410;00:15:22,313;From that moment
192;00:15:18,410;00:15:22,313;until the moment she dies,
193;00:15:22,348;00:15:25,617;she will love you.
194;00:15:25,651;00:15:28,721;Absolutely.
195;00:15:28,755;00:15:32,024;Fiercely.
195;00:15:28,755;00:15:32,024;Why did she leave?
196;00:15:32,059;00:15:33,993;I still can't tell you,
197;00:15:34,027;00:15:36,195;but she will be home soon.
197;00:15:34,027;00:15:36,195;Do you know where she is now?
198;00:15:36,230;00:15:38,164;Today?
199;00:15:38,199;00:15:39,376;No, I don't.
200;00:15:39,401;00:15:41,747;Then how can you promise me
200;00:15:39,401;00:15:41,747;she'll be home soon?
201;00:15:44,673;00:15:48,342;Sometimes I worry you're too
201;00:15:44,673;00:15:48,342;smart for your own good.
202;00:15:49,444;00:15:52,113;I'll never shoot
202;00:15:49,444;00:15:52,113;another arrow.
203;00:15:52,147;00:15:54,782;And where is that written?
204;00:15:55,951;00:15:57,985;You need legs to work a bow.
204;00:15:55,951;00:15:57,985;Hmm.
205;00:15:58,019;00:16:00,721;If the saddle Lord Tyrion
205;00:15:58,019;00:16:00,721;designed actually works,
206;00:16:00,755;00:16:02,755;you could learn to shoot a bow
206;00:16:00,755;00:16:02,755;from horseback.
207;00:16:02,790;00:16:04,824;Really
208;00:16:06,192;00:16:08,627;Dothraki boys learn
208;00:16:06,192;00:16:08,627;when they're four years old.
209;00:16:08,661;00:16:10,263;Why shouldn't you?
210;00:16:25,714;00:16:27,882;Shh, keep it down.
211;00:16:27,917;00:16:30,485;You're not supposed to be
211;00:16:27,917;00:16:30,485;inside the castle walls.
212;00:16:30,520;00:16:33,988;I thought you were supposed to be
212;00:16:30,520;00:16:33,988;an important person around here.
213;00:16:34,023;00:16:36,791;Important enough
213;00:16:34,023;00:16:36,791;for the likes of you.
214;00:16:36,825;00:16:39,794;You're not the only nobleman
214;00:16:36,825;00:16:39,794;in my life, you know.
215;00:16:39,829;00:16:41,763;Who, the Imp?
216;00:16:41,797;00:16:43,665;I'd call him
216;00:16:41,797;00:16:43,665;half a nobleman.
217;00:16:43,699;00:16:45,533;Jealous?
218;00:16:45,568;00:16:47,502;Why should I be jealous?
219;00:16:47,536;00:16:50,539;Anyone with a few coppers in his
219;00:16:47,536;00:16:50,539;pocket can own you for the night.
220;00:16:50,573;00:16:53,541;What's a dwarf like
220;00:16:50,573;00:16:53,541;down below?
221;00:16:53,576;00:16:55,677;I've always wondered.
222;00:16:55,712;00:16:58,380;Might surprise you.
222;00:16:55,712;00:16:58,380;Hmm?
223;00:16:58,415;00:17:01,416;He's good
223;00:16:58,415;00:17:01,416;with his fingers too.
224;00:17:01,451;00:17:03,552;And his tongue.
225;00:17:04,454;00:17:06,254;Generous tipper.
226;00:17:06,289;00:17:09,024;I guess gold is cheap
226;00:17:06,289;00:17:09,024;for a Lannister.
227;00:17:09,058;00:17:11,059;You are jealous.
228;00:17:11,093;00:17:12,761;I'm a Greyjoy.
229;00:17:12,795;00:17:15,030;We've been lords of the
229;00:17:12,795;00:17:15,030;Iron Islands for 300 years.
230;00:17:15,064;00:17:18,167;There's not a family in Westeros
230;00:17:15,064;00:17:18,167;that can look down on us,
231;00:17:18,201;00:17:20,102;not even the Lannisters.
232;00:17:20,137;00:17:22,538;And what about
232;00:17:20,137;00:17:22,538;the Starks?
233;00:17:23,940;00:17:26,575;I've been Lord Stark's ward
233;00:17:23,940;00:17:26,575;since I was eight years old.
234;00:17:26,610;00:17:29,211;A ward--
234;00:17:26,610;00:17:29,211;that's a nice word for it.
235;00:17:29,245;00:17:31,680;Your father rebelled
235;00:17:29,245;00:17:31,680;against King Robert
236;00:17:31,714;00:17:34,182;and if he does it again--
236;00:17:31,714;00:17:34,182;My father fought
237;00:17:34,216;00:17:36,351;for the freedom
237;00:17:34,216;00:17:36,351;of his people.
238;00:17:36,385;00:17:39,821;What did your father do?
238;00:17:36,385;00:17:39,821;Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
239;00:17:39,855;00:17:42,423;You're a very serious boy.
240;00:17:42,458;00:17:46,061;I'm not a boy.
240;00:17:42,458;00:17:46,061;Oh yes, you are.
241;00:17:46,095;00:17:50,131;A serious boy
241;00:17:46,095;00:17:50,131;with a serious cock.
242;00:17:50,166;00:17:52,734;I don't want
242;00:17:50,166;00:17:52,734;to pay for it.
243;00:17:52,768;00:17:55,770;Then get yourself
243;00:17:52,768;00:17:55,770;a wife.
244;00:17:58,641;00:18:01,343;Come on.
245;00:18:02,678;00:18:05,147;I'm not gonna hurt you.
246;00:18:12,688;00:18:15,056;How is your son,
246;00:18:12,688;00:18:15,056;My Lord?
247;00:18:15,090;00:18:18,092;He'll never
247;00:18:15,090;00:18:18,092;walk again.
248;00:18:19,995;00:18:21,930;But his mind is sound?
249;00:18:21,964;00:18:24,132;So they say.
250;00:18:24,166;00:18:26,601;A blessing then.
251;00:18:28,037;00:18:31,607;I suffered an early
251;00:18:28,037;00:18:31,607;mutilation myself.
252;00:18:33,176;00:18:35,778;Some doors
252;00:18:33,176;00:18:35,778;close forever...
253;00:18:35,813;00:18:39,450;Others open
253;00:18:35,813;00:18:39,450;in the most unexpected places.
254;00:18:41,386;00:18:43,154;May I?
255;00:18:47,393;00:18:50,662;If the wrong ears heard
255;00:18:47,393;00:18:50,662;what I'm about to tell you,
256;00:18:50,696;00:18:52,831;off comes my head.
257;00:18:52,865;00:18:55,500;And who would mourn
257;00:18:52,865;00:18:55,500;poor Varys then?
258;00:18:55,535;00:18:59,204;North or South, they sing
258;00:18:55,535;00:18:59,204;no songs for spiders.
259;00:18:59,238;00:19:01,773;But there are things
259;00:18:59,238;00:19:01,773;you must know.
260;00:19:01,807;00:19:04,876;You are the King's Hand
260;00:19:01,807;00:19:04,876;and the King is a fool--
261;00:19:04,910;00:19:07,145;your friend, I know,
261;00:19:04,910;00:19:07,145;but a fool--
262;00:19:07,179;00:19:10,147;and doomed
262;00:19:07,179;00:19:10,147;unless you save him.
263;00:19:10,181;00:19:12,482;I've been in the capital
263;00:19:10,181;00:19:12,482;a month.
264;00:19:13,718;00:19:16,452;Why have you waited so long
264;00:19:13,718;00:19:16,452;to tell me this?
265;00:19:16,487;00:19:18,621;I didn't trust you.
266;00:19:18,655;00:19:20,989;So why do you trust me now?
267;00:19:21,024;00:19:23,225;The Queen is
267;00:19:21,024;00:19:23,225;not the only one
268;00:19:23,259;00:19:25,660;who has been
268;00:19:23,259;00:19:25,660;watching you closely.
269;00:19:25,694;00:19:28,229;There are few men of honor
269;00:19:25,694;00:19:28,229;in the capital.
270;00:19:28,263;00:19:29,930;You are one of them.
271;00:19:29,965;00:19:31,999;I would like to believe
271;00:19:29,965;00:19:31,999;I am another,
272;00:19:32,033;00:19:34,001;strange as that may seem.
273;00:19:34,035;00:19:36,704;What sort of doom
273;00:19:34,035;00:19:36,704;does the King face?
274;00:19:36,738;00:19:39,707;The same sort
274;00:19:36,738;00:19:39,707;as Jon Arryn.
275;00:19:40,943;00:19:43,411;The tears of Lys,
275;00:19:40,943;00:19:43,411;they call it.
276;00:19:43,445;00:19:46,047;A rare and costly thing,
277;00:19:46,082;00:19:47,816;as clear
277;00:19:46,082;00:19:47,816;and tasteless as water.
278;00:19:47,850;00:19:49,985;It leaves no trace.
279;00:19:58,897;00:20:00,765;Who gave it to him?
280;00:20:00,799;00:20:03,702;Some dear friend, no doubt.
280;00:20:00,799;00:20:03,702;But which one?
281;00:20:03,736;00:20:05,404;There were many.
282;00:20:05,438;00:20:08,140;Lord Arryn was a kind
282;00:20:05,438;00:20:08,140;and trusting man.
283;00:20:08,174;00:20:10,542;There was one boy.
284;00:20:10,576;00:20:13,244;All he was
284;00:20:10,576;00:20:13,244;he owed to Jon Arryn.
285;00:20:13,279;00:20:16,081;The squire, Ser Hugh?
286;00:20:18,251;00:20:20,252;Pity what happened
286;00:20:18,251;00:20:20,252;to him,
287;00:20:20,287;00:20:23,356;just when his life seemed
287;00:20:20,287;00:20:23,356;to be going so nicely.
288;00:20:25,225;00:20:27,893;If Ser Hugh poisoned him--
289;00:20:27,927;00:20:30,728;who paid Ser Hugh?
290;00:20:32,097;00:20:33,931;Someone who could afford it.
291;00:20:33,965;00:20:36,334;Jon was a man of peace.
292;00:20:36,368;00:20:38,335;He was Hand for 17 years--
293;00:20:38,370;00:20:40,504;17 good years.
294;00:20:40,539;00:20:42,339;Why kill him?
295;00:20:42,374;00:20:46,777;He started
295;00:20:42,374;00:20:46,777;asking questions.
296;00:21:15,139;00:21:17,975;Man's voice:
296;00:21:15,139;00:21:17,975;He's found one bastard already.
297;00:21:18,009;00:21:20,143;He has the book.
298;00:21:20,178;00:21:22,179;The rest will come.
299;00:21:22,213;00:21:24,782;Man #2: And when he knows
299;00:21:22,213;00:21:24,782;the truth, what will he do?
300;00:21:24,816;00:21:26,717;The gods alone know.
301;00:21:26,751;00:21:29,386;The fools tried
301;00:21:26,751;00:21:29,386;to kill his son.
302;00:21:29,420;00:21:32,556;What's worse--
302;00:21:29,420;00:21:32,556;they botched it.
303;00:21:35,026;00:21:37,995;The wolf and the lion will
303;00:21:35,026;00:21:37,995;be at each other's throats.
304;00:21:38,030;00:21:41,665;We will be at war soon, my friend.
304;00:21:38,030;00:21:41,665;What good is war now?
305;00:21:41,700;00:21:43,501;We're not ready.
306;00:21:43,535;00:21:46,137;If one Hand can die,
306;00:21:43,535;00:21:46,137;why not a second?
307;00:21:46,171;00:21:48,906;This Hand
307;00:21:46,171;00:21:48,906;is not the other.
308;00:21:48,941;00:21:50,908;We need time.
309;00:21:50,943;00:21:53,578;Khal Drogo will not make his
309;00:21:50,943;00:21:53,578;move until his son is born.
310;00:21:53,612;00:21:55,747;You know how
310;00:21:53,612;00:21:55,747;these savages are.
311;00:21:55,781;00:21:59,451;Delay, you say.
311;00:21:55,781;00:21:59,451;Move fast, I reply.
312;00:21:59,485;00:22:02,787;This is no longer
312;00:21:59,485;00:22:02,787;a game for two players.
313;00:22:02,822;00:22:05,323;It never was.
314;00:22:23,975;00:22:27,578;The first to arrive
314;00:22:23,975;00:22:27,578;and the last to leave.
315;00:22:29,147;00:22:31,449;I admire
315;00:22:29,147;00:22:31,449;your industry.
316;00:22:31,483;00:22:33,617;You do move quietly.
317;00:22:33,652;00:22:36,553;We all have
317;00:22:33,652;00:22:36,553;our qualities.
318;00:22:37,989;00:22:39,823;You look
318;00:22:37,989;00:22:39,823;a bit lonely today.
319;00:22:39,857;00:22:42,125;You should pay a visit to
319;00:22:39,857;00:22:42,125;my brothel this evening.
320;00:22:42,159;00:22:43,622;First boy is on the house.
321;00:22:43,647;00:22:45,794;I think you're mistaking
321;00:22:43,647;00:22:45,794;business with pleasure.
322;00:22:45,996;00:22:47,964;Am I?
323;00:22:49,299;00:22:51,601;All those birds that
323;00:22:49,299;00:22:51,601;whisper in your ear--
324;00:22:51,635;00:22:53,735;such pretty little things.
325;00:22:54,771;00:22:57,238;Trust me,
326;00:22:57,273;00:23:00,074;we accommodate
326;00:22:57,273;00:23:00,074;all inclinations.
327;00:23:00,109;00:23:01,809;Oh, I'm sure.
328;00:23:01,844;00:23:05,012;Lord Redwyne likes his boys
328;00:23:01,844;00:23:05,012;very young, I hear.
329;00:23:05,046;00:23:08,348;I'm a purveyor
329;00:23:05,046;00:23:08,348;of beauty and discretion--
330;00:23:08,383;00:23:10,051;both equally important.
331;00:23:10,085;00:23:13,822;Though I suppose beauty
331;00:23:10,085;00:23:13,822;is a subjective quality, no?
332;00:23:13,856;00:23:15,557;Is it true that
333;00:23:15,592;00:23:18,894;Ser Marlon of Tumblestone
333;00:23:15,592;00:23:18,894;prefers amputees?
334;00:23:18,929;00:23:22,131;All desires are valid
334;00:23:18,929;00:23:22,131;to a man with a full purse.
335;00:23:22,166;00:23:25,735;And I heard the most awful
335;00:23:22,166;00:23:25,735;rumor about a certain lord
336;00:23:25,770;00:23:27,771;with a taste
336;00:23:25,770;00:23:27,771;for fresh cadavers.
337;00:23:27,806;00:23:32,176;Must be enormously difficult
337;00:23:27,806;00:23:32,176;to accommodate that inclination.
338;00:23:32,210;00:23:34,111;The logistics alone--
339;00:23:34,145;00:23:37,514;to find beautiful corpses
339;00:23:34,145;00:23:37,514;before they rot.
340;00:23:37,549;00:23:39,517;Strictly speaking,
340;00:23:37,549;00:23:39,517;such a thing
341;00:23:39,551;00:23:41,819;would not be in accordance
341;00:23:39,551;00:23:41,819;with the King's laws.
342;00:23:41,853;00:23:44,421;Strictly speaking.
343;00:23:46,992;00:23:49,526;Tell me--
343;00:23:46,992;00:23:49,526;does someone somewhere
344;00:23:49,561;00:23:53,096;keep your balls
344;00:23:49,561;00:23:53,096;in a little box?
345;00:23:53,131;00:23:55,565;I've often wondered.
346;00:23:56,901;00:23:58,802;Do you know I have no idea
346;00:23:56,901;00:23:58,802;where they are?
347;00:23:58,836;00:24:01,972;And we had been so close.
348;00:24:02,006;00:24:04,474;But enough about me.
348;00:24:02,006;00:24:04,474;How have you been
349;00:24:04,508;00:24:06,476;since we last
349;00:24:04,508;00:24:06,476;saw each other?
350;00:24:06,510;00:24:09,279;Since you last saw me
350;00:24:06,510;00:24:09,279;or since I last saw you?
351;00:24:09,313;00:24:10,852;Now the last time
351;00:24:09,313;00:24:10,852;I saw you,
352;00:24:10,877;00:24:12,502;you were talking
352;00:24:10,877;00:24:12,502;to the Hand of the King.
353;00:24:12,683;00:24:15,718;Saw me with your own eyes?
353;00:24:12,683;00:24:15,718;Eyes I own.
354;00:24:15,752;00:24:17,285;Council business.
355;00:24:17,319;00:24:20,388;We all have so much
355;00:24:17,319;00:24:20,388;to discuss with Ned Stark.
356;00:24:20,422;00:24:23,424;Everyone's well aware
356;00:24:20,422;00:24:23,424;of your enduring fondness
357;00:24:23,458;00:24:25,359;for Lord Stark's wife.
358;00:24:25,393;00:24:29,363;If the Lannisters were behind
358;00:24:25,393;00:24:29,363;the attempt on the Stark boy's life
359;00:24:29,397;00:24:31,412;and it was discovered
359;00:24:29,397;00:24:31,412;that you helped
360;00:24:31,437;00:24:33,557;the Starks come
360;00:24:31,437;00:24:33,557;to that conclusion...
361;00:24:35,237;00:24:38,406;To think a simple word
361;00:24:35,237;00:24:38,406;to the Queen--
362;00:24:38,441;00:24:40,943;one shudders at the thought.
362;00:24:38,441;00:24:40,943;Ooh.
363;00:24:40,978;00:24:43,613;But you know something?
363;00:24:40,978;00:24:43,613;I do believe that I have seen you
364;00:24:43,647;00:24:45,515;even more recently
364;00:24:43,647;00:24:45,515;than you have seen me.
365;00:24:45,549;00:24:48,452;Have you?
365;00:24:45,549;00:24:48,452;Yes.
366;00:24:48,486;00:24:50,287;Earlier today,
366;00:24:48,486;00:24:50,287;I distinctly recall
367;00:24:50,322;00:24:52,723;seeing you talking to Lord Stark
367;00:24:50,322;00:24:52,723;in his chambers.
368;00:24:52,757;00:24:54,959;Was that you
368;00:24:52,757;00:24:54,959;under the bed?
369;00:24:54,993;00:24:56,861;And not long after that
370;00:24:56,895;00:24:59,864;when I saw you
370;00:24:56,895;00:24:59,864;escorting a certain
371;00:24:59,898;00:25:02,566;foreign dignitary...
372;00:25:02,600;00:25:05,202;Council business?
373;00:25:05,237;00:25:08,806;Of course you would have friends
373;00:25:05,237;00:25:08,806;from across the Narrow Sea.
374;00:25:08,840;00:25:11,342;You're from there
374;00:25:08,840;00:25:11,342;yourself, after all.
375;00:25:11,376;00:25:14,712;We're friends,
375;00:25:11,376;00:25:14,712;aren't we, Lord Varys?
376;00:25:14,747;00:25:16,915;I'd like to think we are.
377;00:25:16,949;00:25:19,318;So you can imagine
377;00:25:16,949;00:25:19,318;my burden,
378;00:25:19,352;00:25:23,222;wondering if the King might
378;00:25:19,352;00:25:23,222;question my friend's sympathies.
379;00:25:23,256;00:25:27,293;To stand at a crossroads where
379;00:25:23,256;00:25:27,293;turning left means loyalty to a friend,
380;00:25:27,327;00:25:29,194;turning right
380;00:25:27,327;00:25:29,194;loyalty to the realm--
381;00:25:29,229;00:25:31,363;Oh, please.
381;00:25:29,229;00:25:31,363;To find myself in a position
382;00:25:31,397;00:25:33,665;where a simple word to the King--
383;00:25:33,699;00:25:35,734;What are you two
383;00:25:33,699;00:25:35,734;conspiring about?
384;00:25:35,768;00:25:39,338;Well, whatever it is,
384;00:25:35,768;00:25:39,338;you'd best hurry up.
385;00:25:39,373;00:25:40,906;My brother is coming.
386;00:25:40,941;00:25:42,608;To a small council meeting?
387;00:25:42,642;00:25:45,644;Disturbing news
387;00:25:42,642;00:25:45,644;from far away.
388;00:25:46,646;00:25:48,280;Haven't you heard?
389;00:26:18,147;00:26:20,215;Off with you.
389;00:26:18,147;00:26:20,215;No begging.
390;00:26:20,250;00:26:22,051;I'm not a beggar.
390;00:26:20,250;00:26:22,051;I live here.
391;00:26:22,085;00:26:24,487;D'you want a smack on your ear
391;00:26:22,085;00:26:24,487;to help you with your hearing?
392;00:26:24,521;00:26:26,422;I want to see my father.
393;00:26:26,457;00:26:29,191;I want to fuck the Queen,
393;00:26:26,457;00:26:29,191;for all the good it does me.
394;00:26:29,226;00:26:31,059;You want your father, boy?
395;00:26:31,094;00:26:33,261;He's lying on the floor
395;00:26:31,094;00:26:33,261;of some tavern,
396;00:26:33,296;00:26:35,363;getting pissed on
396;00:26:33,296;00:26:35,363;by his friends.
397;00:26:35,397;00:26:37,098;My father
397;00:26:35,397;00:26:37,098;is Hand of the King!
398;00:26:37,133;00:26:40,435;I'm not a boy.
398;00:26:37,133;00:26:40,435;I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell
399;00:26:40,469;00:26:42,064;and if you lay a hand on me,
399;00:26:40,469;00:26:42,064;my father
400;00:26:42,089;00:26:43,628;will have both
400;00:26:42,089;00:26:43,628;your heads on spikes.
401;00:26:44,006;00:26:46,474;Now are you going to let me by
401;00:26:44,006;00:26:46,474;or do I need to smack you
402;00:26:46,508;00:26:48,976;on the ear to help
402;00:26:46,508;00:26:48,976;with your hearing?
403;00:26:51,113;00:26:54,349;You know I had half my guard
403;00:26:51,113;00:26:54,349;out searching for you?
404;00:26:57,554;00:26:59,321;You promised me
404;00:26:57,554;00:26:59,321;this would stop.
405;00:26:59,356;00:27:00,990;They said they were
405;00:26:59,356;00:27:00,990;going to kill you.
406;00:27:01,025;00:27:03,493;Who did?
406;00:27:01,025;00:27:03,493;I didn't see them,
407;00:27:03,528;00:27:05,796;but I think one was fat.
407;00:27:03,528;00:27:05,796;Oh, Arya.
408;00:27:05,831;00:27:08,566;I'm not lying!
408;00:27:05,831;00:27:08,566;They said you found the bastard
409;00:27:08,600;00:27:11,569;and the wolves are fighting
409;00:27:08,600;00:27:11,569;the lions and the savage--
410;00:27:11,603;00:27:13,270;something about the savage.
411;00:27:13,305;00:27:15,672;Where did you hear this?
411;00:27:13,305;00:27:15,672;In the dungeons,
412;00:27:15,706;00:27:17,111;near the dragon skulls.
413;00:27:17,136;00:27:18,471;What were you doing
413;00:27:17,136;00:27:18,471;in the dungeons?
414;00:27:20,211;00:27:22,312;Chasing a cat.
415;00:27:24,749;00:27:26,082;Pardon, My Lord.
416;00:27:26,117;00:27:28,251;There's a night's watchman
416;00:27:26,117;00:27:28,251;here begging a word.
417;00:27:28,285;00:27:29,585;He says it's urgent.
418;00:27:36,526;00:27:40,462;Your name, friend?
418;00:27:36,526;00:27:40,462;Yoren, if it please.
419;00:27:40,496;00:27:42,339;This must be your son.
419;00:27:40,496;00:27:42,339;He has the look.
420;00:27:42,364;00:27:43,464;I'm a girl!
421;00:27:43,482;00:27:44,949;Did Benjen send you?
422;00:27:44,966;00:27:46,800;No one sent me,
422;00:27:44,966;00:27:46,800;My Lord.
423;00:27:46,834;00:27:49,069;I'm here to find
423;00:27:46,834;00:27:49,069;men for the Wall,
424;00:27:49,103;00:27:50,865;see if there's any scum
424;00:27:49,103;00:27:50,865;in the dungeons
425;00:27:50,890;00:27:52,090;that might be fit for service.
426;00:27:52,174;00:27:54,408;Oh, we'll find
426;00:27:52,174;00:27:54,408;recruits for you.
427;00:27:54,442;00:27:55,909;Thank you, My Lord.
428;00:27:55,944;00:27:58,412;But that's not why
428;00:27:55,944;00:27:58,412;I disturb you now.
429;00:27:59,648;00:28:02,350;Your brother Benjen,
429;00:27:59,648;00:28:02,350;his blood runs black--
430;00:28:02,384;00:28:04,452;makes him as much
430;00:28:02,384;00:28:04,452;my brother as yours.
431;00:28:04,486;00:28:07,422;It's for his sake
431;00:28:04,486;00:28:07,422;I rode here so hard
432;00:28:07,456;00:28:10,058;I damn near
432;00:28:07,456;00:28:10,058;killed my horse.
433;00:28:10,092;00:28:11,793;There are others
433;00:28:10,092;00:28:11,793;riding too.
434;00:28:11,827;00:28:13,896;The whole city
434;00:28:11,827;00:28:13,896;will know by tomorrow.
435;00:28:13,930;00:28:15,631;Know what?
436;00:28:17,134;00:28:19,769;Best said
436;00:28:17,134;00:28:19,769;in private, My Lord.
437;00:28:25,010;00:28:28,280;Go on.
437;00:28:25,010;00:28:28,280;We'll talk more later.
438;00:28:28,314;00:28:30,915;Jory, take her
438;00:28:28,314;00:28:30,915;safely to her room.
439;00:28:30,950;00:28:34,085;Come along, My Lady.
439;00:28:30,950;00:28:34,085;You heard your father.
440;00:28:39,591;00:28:41,525;How many guards
440;00:28:39,591;00:28:41,525;does my father have?
441;00:28:41,560;00:28:43,761;Here in
441;00:28:41,560;00:28:43,761;King's Landing? 50.
442;00:28:44,997;00:28:47,164;You wouldn't let anyone
442;00:28:44,997;00:28:47,164;kill him, would you?
443;00:28:47,199;00:28:50,434;No fear on that count,
443;00:28:47,199;00:28:50,434;little lady.
444;00:28:54,806;00:28:58,075;Well?
444;00:28:54,806;00:28:58,075;It's about your wife, My Lord.
445;00:28:59,678;00:29:01,512;She's taken the Imp.
446;00:29:18,563;00:29:20,597;You're far from home,
446;00:29:18,563;00:29:20,597;Lady Stark.
447;00:29:20,631;00:29:22,365;To whom do I speak?
448;00:29:22,400;00:29:24,401;Ser Vardis Egan,
448;00:29:22,400;00:29:24,401;knight of the Vale.
449;00:29:24,435;00:29:26,403;Is Lady Arryn
449;00:29:24,435;00:29:26,403;expecting your visit?
450;00:29:26,437;00:29:28,705;There was no time
450;00:29:26,437;00:29:28,705;to send word.
451;00:29:28,739;00:29:30,940;May I ask, My Lady,
452;00:29:30,975;00:29:33,676;why he is with you?
453;00:29:33,711;00:29:35,745;That's why
453;00:29:33,711;00:29:35,745;there was no time.
454;00:29:35,779;00:29:38,681;He is my prisoner.
454;00:29:35,779;00:29:38,681;He doesn't look like a prisoner.
455;00:29:38,715;00:29:42,018;My sister will decide
455;00:29:38,715;00:29:42,018;what he looks like.
456;00:29:42,052;00:29:44,187;Yes, My Lady.
457;00:29:44,221;00:29:46,423;She will at that.
458;00:29:52,296;00:29:55,898;The Eyrie.
458;00:29:52,296;00:29:55,898;They say it's impregnable.
459;00:29:57,200;00:29:59,234;Give me 10 good men
459;00:29:57,200;00:29:59,234;and some climbing spikes--
460;00:29:59,269;00:30:01,136;I'll impregnate the bitch.
461;00:30:02,605;00:30:04,739;I like you.
462;00:30:14,282;00:30:16,516;Lord Stark, your presence
462;00:30:14,282;00:30:16,516;has been requested
463;00:30:16,551;00:30:18,918;in the small council chamber.
463;00:30:16,551;00:30:18,918;A meeting has been called.
464;00:30:18,953;00:30:21,120;I need to see
464;00:30:18,953;00:30:21,120;the King first-- alone.
465;00:30:21,154;00:30:23,589;The King is at the small council
465;00:30:21,154;00:30:23,589;meeting, My Lord.
466;00:30:23,623;00:30:25,357;He has summoned you.
467;00:30:25,391;00:30:28,561;Is it about my wife?
467;00:30:25,391;00:30:28,561;No, My Lord.
468;00:30:28,595;00:30:31,531;I believe it concerns
468;00:30:28,595;00:30:31,531;Daenerys Targaryen.
469;00:30:31,565;00:30:33,933;The whore is pregnant.
470;00:30:33,968;00:30:36,903;You're speaking of murdering a child.
470;00:30:33,968;00:30:36,903;I warned you
471;00:30:36,938;00:30:39,406;this would happen.
471;00:30:36,938;00:30:39,406;Back in the North, I warned you,
472;00:30:39,441;00:30:41,042;but you didn't care
472;00:30:39,441;00:30:41,042;to hear.
473;00:30:41,076;00:30:43,679;Well, hear it now.
474;00:30:43,713;00:30:46,983;I want 'em dead,
474;00:30:43,713;00:30:46,983;mother and child both.
475;00:30:47,017;00:30:49,152;And that fool Viserys
475;00:30:47,017;00:30:49,152;as well.
476;00:30:49,186;00:30:51,220;Is that plain enough
476;00:30:49,186;00:30:51,220;for you?
477;00:30:51,254;00:30:52,855;I want them both dead.
478;00:30:52,889;00:30:55,424;You will dishonor yourself
478;00:30:52,889;00:30:55,424;forever if you do this.
479;00:30:55,459;00:30:56,459;Honor?!
480;00:30:56,493;00:30:59,161;I've got Seven Kingdoms
480;00:30:56,493;00:30:59,161;to rule!
481;00:30:59,196;00:31:01,964;One King,
481;00:30:59,196;00:31:01,964;Seven Kingdoms.
482;00:31:01,998;00:31:04,433;Do you think honor
482;00:31:01,998;00:31:04,433;keeps them in line?
483;00:31:04,467;00:31:06,902;Do you think it's honor
483;00:31:04,467;00:31:06,902;that's keeping the peace?
484;00:31:06,937;00:31:09,538;It's fear--
484;00:31:06,937;00:31:09,538;fear and blood.
485;00:31:09,572;00:31:11,272;Then we're no better
485;00:31:09,572;00:31:11,272;than the Mad King.
486;00:31:11,307;00:31:13,308;Careful, Ned.
486;00:31:11,307;00:31:13,308;Careful now.
487;00:31:13,342;00:31:15,310;You want
487;00:31:13,342;00:31:15,310;to assassinate a girl
488;00:31:15,344;00:31:17,378;because the Spider
488;00:31:15,344;00:31:17,378;heard a rumor?
489;00:31:17,413;00:31:20,315;No rumor, My Lord.
489;00:31:17,413;00:31:20,315;The princess is with child.
490;00:31:20,349;00:31:22,116;Based on whose
490;00:31:20,349;00:31:22,116;information?
491;00:31:22,150;00:31:23,483;Ser Jorah Mormont.
492;00:31:23,508;00:31:25,796;He is serving as advisor
492;00:31:23,508;00:31:25,796;to the Targaryens.
493;00:31:26,121;00:31:28,255;Mormont?
493;00:31:26,121;00:31:28,255;You bring us the whispers
494;00:31:28,289;00:31:31,992;of a traitor half a world away
494;00:31:28,289;00:31:31,992;and call it fact?
495;00:31:32,027;00:31:35,062;Jorah Mormont's
495;00:31:32,027;00:31:35,062;a slaver, not a traitor.
496;00:31:35,097;00:31:37,499;Small difference, I know,
496;00:31:35,097;00:31:37,499;to an honorable man.
497;00:31:37,533;00:31:40,202;He broke the law, betrayed
497;00:31:37,533;00:31:40,202;his family, fled our land.
498;00:31:40,236;00:31:43,106;We commit murder
498;00:31:40,236;00:31:43,106;on the word of this man?
499;00:31:43,140;00:31:45,108;And if he's right?
500;00:31:45,142;00:31:47,177;If she has a son?
501;00:31:47,211;00:31:50,346;A Targaryen at the head
501;00:31:47,211;00:31:50,346;of a Dothraki army...
502;00:31:50,381;00:31:54,050;What then?
502;00:31:50,381;00:31:54,050;The Narrow Sea still lies between us.
503;00:31:54,085;00:31:56,219;I'll fear the Dothraki
504;00:31:56,253;00:31:58,688;the day they teach
504;00:31:56,253;00:31:58,688;their horses to run on water.
505;00:31:58,722;00:32:00,823;Do nothing?
506;00:32:00,858;00:32:03,026;That's your wise advice?
507;00:32:03,060;00:32:06,162;Do nothing till our enemies
507;00:32:03,060;00:32:06,162;are on our shores?
508;00:32:06,196;00:32:09,031;You're my council.
508;00:32:06,196;00:32:09,031;Counsel!
509;00:32:09,066;00:32:12,901;Speak sense to this
509;00:32:09,066;00:32:12,901;honorable fool.
510;00:32:12,936;00:32:16,938;I understand your misgivings,
510;00:32:12,936;00:32:16,938;My Lord.
511;00:32:16,973;00:32:19,641;Truly, I do.
511;00:32:16,973;00:32:19,641;It is a terrible thing
512;00:32:19,675;00:32:21,742;we must consider,
512;00:32:19,675;00:32:21,742;a vile thing.
513;00:32:21,777;00:32:25,011;Yet we who presume
513;00:32:21,777;00:32:25,011;to rule must sometimes
514;00:32:25,046;00:32:28,581;do vile things for
514;00:32:25,046;00:32:28,581;the good of the realm.
515;00:32:28,616;00:32:31,818;Should the gods
515;00:32:28,616;00:32:31,818;grant Daenerys a son,
516;00:32:31,852;00:32:33,586;the realm will bleed.
517;00:32:33,621;00:32:35,922;I bear this girl no ill will,
518;00:32:35,956;00:32:38,024;but should
518;00:32:35,956;00:32:38,024;the Dothraki invade,
519;00:32:38,058;00:32:39,926;how many innocents will die?
520;00:32:39,960;00:32:41,995;How many towns
520;00:32:39,960;00:32:41,995;will burn?
521;00:32:42,029;00:32:45,231;Is it not wiser,
521;00:32:42,029;00:32:45,231;kinder even,
522;00:32:45,265;00:32:47,667;that she should die now
523;00:32:47,701;00:32:51,070;so that tens of thousands
523;00:32:47,701;00:32:51,070;might live?
524;00:32:51,104;00:32:53,606;We should have had them
524;00:32:51,104;00:32:53,606;both killed years ago.
525;00:32:53,640;00:32:56,074;When you find yourself
525;00:32:53,640;00:32:56,074;in bed with an ugly woman,
526;00:32:56,109;00:32:59,444;best close your eyes,
526;00:32:56,109;00:32:59,444;get it over with.
527;00:32:59,479;00:33:02,881;Cut her throat.
527;00:32:59,479;00:33:02,881;Be done with it.
528;00:33:08,787;00:33:11,656;I followed you
528;00:33:08,787;00:33:11,656;into war--
529;00:33:11,690;00:33:13,691;twice,
530;00:33:13,726;00:33:15,961;without doubts,
531;00:33:15,996;00:33:17,930;without second thoughts.
532;00:33:17,964;00:33:21,568;But I will not
532;00:33:17,964;00:33:21,568;follow you now.
533;00:33:21,602;00:33:23,970;The Robert I grew up with
534;00:33:24,005;00:33:27,574;didn't tremble at the shadow
534;00:33:24,005;00:33:27,574;of an unborn child.
535;00:33:29,544;00:33:31,445;She dies.
536;00:33:32,614;00:33:34,715;I will have no part in it.
537;00:33:34,749;00:33:37,017;You're the King's Hand,
537;00:33:34,749;00:33:37,017;Lord Stark.
538;00:33:37,051;00:33:40,720;You'll do as I command
538;00:33:37,051;00:33:40,720;or I'll find me a hand who will.
539;00:33:48,895;00:33:50,729;And good luck to him.
540;00:33:51,798;00:33:53,332;I thought you were
540;00:33:51,798;00:33:53,332;a better man.
541;00:33:53,366;00:33:55,635;Out.
541;00:33:53,366;00:33:55,635;Out, damn you.
542;00:33:55,669;00:33:58,305;I'm done with you.
543;00:33:58,339;00:34:01,308;Go, run back
543;00:33:58,339;00:34:01,308;to Winterfell!
544;00:34:01,343;00:34:04,146;I'll have your head
544;00:34:01,343;00:34:04,146;on a spike!
545;00:34:05,481;00:34:08,417;I'll put it there
545;00:34:05,481;00:34:08,417;myself, you fool!
546;00:34:08,451;00:34:11,955;You think you're too good for this?
546;00:34:08,451;00:34:11,955;Too proud and honorable?
547;00:34:11,989;00:34:13,756;This is a war!
548;00:34:15,926;00:34:17,761;I'll go ahead
548;00:34:15,926;00:34:17,761;with my daughters.
549;00:34:17,795;00:34:19,363;Get them ready.
549;00:34:17,795;00:34:19,363;Do it yourself.
550;00:34:19,397;00:34:21,833;Don't ask anyone for help.
550;00:34:19,397;00:34:21,833;Right away, My Lord.
551;00:34:21,867;00:34:24,002;Lord Baelish
551;00:34:21,867;00:34:24,002;is here for you.
552;00:34:26,139;00:34:28,440;His Grace went on about you
552;00:34:26,139;00:34:28,440;at some length
553;00:34:28,474;00:34:30,709;after you took your leave.
554;00:34:30,743;00:34:32,678;The word treason
554;00:34:30,743;00:34:32,678;was mentioned.
555;00:34:33,947;00:34:35,414;What can I do for you?
556;00:34:35,449;00:34:37,215;When do you return
556;00:34:35,449;00:34:37,215;to Winterfell?
557;00:34:37,250;00:34:38,558;Why? What do you care?
558;00:34:38,583;00:34:40,268;If you're still here
558;00:34:38,583;00:34:40,268;come nightfall,
559;00:34:40,453;00:34:42,188;I'll take you to see
559;00:34:40,453;00:34:42,188;the last person Jon Arryn
560;00:34:42,213;00:34:43,713;spoke with before falling ill.
561;00:34:43,822;00:34:46,891;If that sort of thing
561;00:34:43,822;00:34:46,891;still interests you.
562;00:34:47,793;00:34:49,494;I don't have the time.
563;00:34:49,528;00:34:52,163;It won't take more than an hour.
563;00:34:49,528;00:34:52,163;But as you please.
564;00:34:58,103;00:34:59,266;Round up all the men we have
565;00:34:59,291;00:35:00,844;and station them outside
565;00:34:59,291;00:35:00,844;the girls' chambers.
566;00:35:01,372;00:35:04,941;Who are your best two swords?
566;00:35:01,372;00:35:04,941;Heward and Wyl.
567;00:35:04,975;00:35:07,677;Find them and meet me
567;00:35:04,975;00:35:07,677;at the stables.
568;00:35:13,050;00:35:15,585;You bring him here
568;00:35:13,050;00:35:15,585;without permission?
569;00:35:15,620;00:35:18,656;You pollute my home
569;00:35:15,620;00:35:18,656;with his presence?
570;00:35:21,527;00:35:23,461;Your aunt has done
570;00:35:21,527;00:35:23,461;a bad thing, Robin,
571;00:35:23,496;00:35:25,297;a very bad thing.
572;00:35:25,331;00:35:27,800;You remember her,
572;00:35:25,331;00:35:27,800;don't you?
573;00:35:29,103;00:35:31,004;Isn't he beautiful?
574;00:35:31,038;00:35:33,807;And strong too.
574;00:35:31,038;00:35:33,807;Jon knew it.
575;00:35:33,841;00:35:36,876;His last words were
575;00:35:33,841;00:35:36,876;the seed is strong.
576;00:35:36,910;00:35:38,411;He wanted everyone to know
577;00:35:38,445;00:35:41,714;what a good, strong boy
577;00:35:38,445;00:35:41,714;his son would grow up to be.
578;00:35:41,749;00:35:45,652;Look at him,
578;00:35:41,749;00:35:45,652;the Lord of all the Vale.
579;00:35:45,686;00:35:47,420;Lysa,
580;00:35:47,455;00:35:50,524;you wrote me about
580;00:35:47,455;00:35:50,524;the Lannisters,
581;00:35:50,558;00:35:53,393;warning me--
581;00:35:50,558;00:35:53,393;To stay away from them!
582;00:35:53,427;00:35:56,397;Not to bring one here!
583;00:35:56,431;00:35:58,532;Mommy?
584;00:35:58,566;00:36:01,234;Is that the bad man?
584;00:35:58,566;00:36:01,234;It is.
585;00:36:03,304;00:36:06,073;He's little.
586;00:36:06,107;00:36:08,609;He's Tyrion the imp
586;00:36:06,107;00:36:08,609;of house Lannister.
587;00:36:09,611;00:36:10,978;He killed your father.
588;00:36:11,012;00:36:12,713;He murdered
588;00:36:11,012;00:36:12,713;the Hand of the King!
589;00:36:12,748;00:36:15,082;Oh, did I kill him too?
590;00:36:15,116;00:36:16,951;I've been a very busy man.
591;00:36:16,985;00:36:19,653;You will
591;00:36:16,985;00:36:19,653;watch your tongue!
592;00:36:19,687;00:36:22,423;These men are knights
592;00:36:19,687;00:36:22,423;of the Vale.
593;00:36:22,457;00:36:25,292;Every one of them
593;00:36:22,457;00:36:25,292;loved Jon Arryn.
594;00:36:25,327;00:36:26,994;Every one of them would
594;00:36:25,327;00:36:26,994;die for me.
595;00:36:27,028;00:36:28,433;If any harm comes to me,
596;00:36:28,458;00:36:30,606;my brother Jaime will see
596;00:36:28,458;00:36:30,606;that they do.
597;00:36:30,731;00:36:31,805;You can't hurt us.
598;00:36:31,830;00:36:33,464;No one can hurt us here.
598;00:36:31,830;00:36:33,464;Tell him, mommy!
599;00:36:33,735;00:36:37,571;Tell him!
599;00:36:33,735;00:36:37,571;Shh shh shh, my sweet boy.
600;00:36:37,606;00:36:40,107;He's just trying
600;00:36:37,606;00:36:40,107;to frighten us.
601;00:36:40,141;00:36:41,975;Lannisters are all liars.
602;00:36:42,010;00:36:44,979;No one will
602;00:36:42,010;00:36:44,979;hurt my baby.

604;00:36:47,549;00:36:50,418;I want to see

605;00:36:51,687;00:36:53,488;Perhaps you will,
605;00:36:51,687;00:36:53,488;my little love.
606;00:36:53,523;00:36:55,657;This man is my prisoner.
607;00:36:55,692;00:36:58,694;I will not have him
607;00:36:55,692;00:36:58,694;harmed.
608;00:37:00,731;00:37:02,265;Ser Vardis,

609;00:37:02,299;00:37:05,135;is weary.
610;00:37:05,169;00:37:08,004;Take him down below
610;00:37:05,169;00:37:08,004;so he can rest.
611;00:37:08,039;00:37:11,240;Introduce him to Mord.
612;00:37:13,410;00:37:14,843;You go sleep,

615;00:37:55,852;00:37:58,754;but he won't do anything.
616;00:37:58,788;00:38:00,322;He adores the man.
617;00:38:00,356;00:38:02,124;You're jealous.
618;00:38:02,158;00:38:04,392;Are you sure
618;00:38:02,158;00:38:04,392;this won't hurt?
619;00:38:04,426;00:38:07,695;Only if I slip.
620;00:38:09,798;00:38:12,599;And you'd prefer me like this?
620;00:38:09,798;00:38:12,599;Mm-hmm.
621;00:38:12,634;00:38:15,435;If you want hairless, maybe
621;00:38:12,634;00:38:15,435;you should find a little boy.
622;00:38:15,469;00:38:17,237;I want you.
623;00:38:18,906;00:38:22,107;My brother thinks that anyone

626;00:38:28,013;00:38:31,349;the knight of the flowers?
627;00:38:31,383;00:38:33,551;How many wars
627;00:38:31,383;00:38:33,551;have you fought in?
628;00:38:33,585;00:38:37,055;Oh, and how much did your father
628;00:38:33,585;00:38:37,055;spend on that armor of yours?
629;00:38:37,089;00:38:39,658;Hold still.
630;00:38:39,692;00:38:42,894;All I ever hear from Robert and
630;00:38:39,692;00:38:42,894;Stannis is how I'm not tough enough,
631;00:38:42,928;00:38:44,996;how I squirm
631;00:38:42,928;00:38:44,996;at the sight of blood--
632;00:38:45,031;00:38:47,566;you did vomit when that boy's eye
632;00:38:45,031;00:38:47,566;was knocked out in the melee.
633;00:38:47,600;00:38:49,530;His eye was dangling
633;00:38:47,600;00:38:49,530;out of the damn socket!
634;00:38:49,555;00:38:51,603;He shouldn't have entered the melee
634;00:38:49,555;00:38:51,603;if he didn't know how to fight.
635;00:38:51,672;00:38:52,872;Easy for you to say.
636;00:38:53,539;00:38:55,474;Not everyone is such
636;00:38:53,539;00:38:55,474;a gifted swordsman.
637;00:38:55,508;00:38:58,009;It's not a gift.
637;00:38:55,508;00:38:58,009;No one gave it to me.
638;00:38:58,044;00:39:00,178;I'm good because
638;00:38:58,044;00:39:00,178;I work at it--
639;00:39:00,212;00:39:02,947;every day of my life
639;00:39:00,212;00:39:02,947;since I could hold a stick.
640;00:39:02,982;00:39:05,316;I could work at fighting
640;00:39:02,982;00:39:05,316;all day, every day,
641;00:39:05,351;00:39:07,252;and still never
641;00:39:05,351;00:39:07,252;be as good as you.
642;00:39:07,286;00:39:09,854;Yes well, I guess
642;00:39:07,286;00:39:09,854;we'll never know.
643;00:39:19,364;00:39:21,800;Everywhere?
643;00:39:19,364;00:39:21,800;Everywhere.
644;00:39:21,834;00:39:24,469;So how did it end up?
645;00:39:24,503;00:39:26,103;The Targaryen
645;00:39:24,503;00:39:26,103;girl will die?
646;00:39:26,138;00:39:29,273;It needs to be done,
646;00:39:26,138;00:39:29,273;unpleasant as it is.
647;00:39:29,307;00:39:31,508;Robert's rather
647;00:39:29,307;00:39:31,508;tasteless about it.
648;00:39:31,543;00:39:33,377;Every time he talks
648;00:39:31,543;00:39:33,377;about killing her,
649;00:39:33,412;00:39:35,580;I swear the table
649;00:39:33,412;00:39:35,580;rises six inches.
650;00:39:35,614;00:39:38,349;It's a shame he can't muster the
650;00:39:35,614;00:39:38,349;same enthusiasm for his wife.
651;00:39:38,383;00:39:41,085;He does have a deep, abiding
651;00:39:38,383;00:39:41,085;lust for her money.
652;00:39:41,120;00:39:43,254;You have to give it
652;00:39:41,120;00:39:43,254;to the Lannisters--
653;00:39:43,288;00:39:45,189;they may be the most
653;00:39:43,288;00:39:45,189;pompous, ponderous cunts
654;00:39:45,223;00:39:46,891;the gods ever suffered
654;00:39:45,223;00:39:46,891;to walk the world,
655;00:39:46,925;00:39:49,593;but they do have outrageous
655;00:39:46,925;00:39:49,593;amounts of money.
656;00:39:50,829;00:39:52,997;I have an outrageous
656;00:39:50,829;00:39:52,997;amount of money.
657;00:39:53,031;00:39:54,998;Not as much
657;00:39:53,031;00:39:54,998;as the Lannisters.
658;00:39:55,032;00:39:57,300;But a lot more than you.
659;00:39:58,602;00:40:01,303;Robert's threatening
659;00:39:58,602;00:40:01,303;to take me hunting with him.
660;00:40:01,338;00:40:03,672;Last time we were out there
660;00:40:01,338;00:40:03,672;for two weeks.
661;00:40:03,706;00:40:06,274;Tramping through the trees
661;00:40:03,706;00:40:06,274;in the rain, day after day,
662;00:40:06,308;00:40:09,777;all so he can stick his spear
662;00:40:06,308;00:40:09,777;into something's flesh.
663;00:40:09,812;00:40:12,781;Oh. But Robert
663;00:40:09,812;00:40:12,781;loves his killing.
664;00:40:12,815;00:40:15,217;And he's the King.
664;00:40:12,815;00:40:15,217;Hmm.
665;00:40:15,251;00:40:18,554;How did that ever happen?
665;00:40:15,251;00:40:18,554;Because he loves his killing.
666;00:40:18,588;00:40:20,890;And he used to be
666;00:40:18,588;00:40:20,890;good at it.
667;00:40:20,924;00:40:23,893;Do you know
667;00:40:20,924;00:40:23,893;who should be king?
668;00:40:24,862;00:40:26,763;Be serious.
668;00:40:24,862;00:40:26,763;I am.
669;00:40:26,798;00:40:29,099;My father could be
669;00:40:26,798;00:40:29,099;your bank.
670;00:40:29,133;00:40:32,001;I've never fought in a war before,
670;00:40:29,133;00:40:32,001;but I'd fight for you.
671;00:40:32,036;00:40:33,936;I'm fourth in line.
672;00:40:33,971;00:40:36,772;And where was Robert in the line
672;00:40:33,971;00:40:36,772;of royal succession?
673;00:40:36,807;00:40:38,272;Joffrey is a monster.
674;00:40:38,297;00:40:40,008;Tommen is eight.
674;00:40:38,297;00:40:40,008;Stannis?
675;00:40:40,070;00:40:41,938;Stannis has the
675;00:40:40,070;00:40:41,938;personality of a lobster.
676;00:40:42,178;00:40:44,145;He's still
676;00:40:42,178;00:40:44,145;my older brother.
677;00:40:44,180;00:40:46,481;What are you doing?!
677;00:40:44,180;00:40:46,481;Look at it.
678;00:40:46,515;00:40:47,629;You cut me.
679;00:40:47,654;00:40:49,058;It's just blood.
679;00:40:47,654;00:40:49,058;We've all got it in us.
680;00:40:49,184;00:40:51,452;Sometimes a little spills.
681;00:40:51,486;00:40:54,889;If you become King, you're
681;00:40:51,486;00:40:54,889;going to see a lot of this.
682;00:40:54,923;00:40:56,724;You need to get used to it.
683;00:40:56,758;00:40:58,892;Go on. Look.
684;00:41:01,263;00:41:03,497;People love you.
685;00:41:04,799;00:41:06,834;They love to serve you
685;00:41:04,799;00:41:06,834;because you're kind to them.
686;00:41:06,869;00:41:09,036;They want to be near you.
687;00:41:11,440;00:41:14,709;You're willing to do
687;00:41:11,440;00:41:14,709;what needs to be done,
688;00:41:14,743;00:41:17,478;but you don't gloat over it.
689;00:41:17,513;00:41:19,747;You don't love killing.
690;00:41:22,284;00:41:24,585;Where is it written
690;00:41:22,284;00:41:24,585;that power
691;00:41:24,619;00:41:27,387;is the sole province
691;00:41:24,619;00:41:27,387;of the worst?
692;00:41:27,421;00:41:29,489;That thrones are only made
693;00:41:29,523;00:41:31,824;for the hated
693;00:41:29,523;00:41:31,824;and the feared?
694;00:41:35,329;00:41:37,998;You would be
694;00:41:35,329;00:41:37,998;a wonderful King.
695;00:41:55,218;00:41:58,454;I'm sorry your marriage
695;00:41:55,218;00:41:58,454;to Ned Stark didn't work out.
696;00:41:58,488;00:42:00,389;You seemed
696;00:41:58,488;00:42:00,389;so good together.
697;00:42:00,424;00:42:03,459;I'm glad I could do something
697;00:42:00,424;00:42:03,459;to make you happy.
698;00:42:07,230;00:42:10,065;Without a Hand,
698;00:42:07,230;00:42:10,065;everything will fall to pieces.
699;00:42:10,100;00:42:12,067;I suppose this is where
699;00:42:10,100;00:42:12,067;you tell me
700;00:42:12,102;00:42:14,937;to give the job
700;00:42:12,102;00:42:14,937;to your brother Jaime.
701;00:42:14,972;00:42:16,606;No.
702;00:42:16,640;00:42:18,741;He's not serious enough.
703;00:42:18,775;00:42:20,710;I'll say this for Ned Stark:
704;00:42:20,744;00:42:22,845;He's serious enough.
705;00:42:24,081;00:42:26,882;Was it really worth it?
705;00:42:24,081;00:42:26,882;Losing him this way?
706;00:42:26,917;00:42:29,018;I don't know.
707;00:42:31,655;00:42:34,224;But I do know this:
708;00:42:34,258;00:42:39,328;If the Targaryen girl convinces
708;00:42:34,258;00:42:39,328;her horselord husband to invade
709;00:42:39,363;00:42:43,566;and the Dothraki horde
709;00:42:39,363;00:42:43,566;crosses the Narrow Sea...
710;00:42:45,302;00:42:47,136;We won't be able
710;00:42:45,302;00:42:47,136;to stop them.
711;00:42:47,170;00:42:49,672;The Dothraki don't sail.
711;00:42:47,170;00:42:49,672;Every child knows that.
712;00:42:49,706;00:42:52,608;They don't have discipline.
712;00:42:49,706;00:42:52,608;They don't have armor.
713;00:42:52,642;00:42:54,610;They don't have
713;00:42:52,642;00:42:54,610;siege weapons.
714;00:42:54,644;00:42:56,478;It's a neat
714;00:42:54,644;00:42:56,478;little trick you do:
715;00:42:56,513;00:42:59,782;You move your lips and
715;00:42:56,513;00:42:59,782;your father's voice comes out.
716;00:42:59,816;00:43:02,951;Is my father wrong?
717;00:43:06,256;00:43:09,158;Let's say
717;00:43:06,256;00:43:09,158;Viserys Targaryen lands
718;00:43:09,192;00:43:12,662;with 40,000 Dothraki
718;00:43:09,192;00:43:12,662;screamers at his back.
719;00:43:12,696;00:43:15,197;We hole up
719;00:43:12,696;00:43:15,197;in our castles--
720;00:43:15,232;00:43:17,967;a wise move--
720;00:43:15,232;00:43:17,967;only a fool
721;00:43:18,002;00:43:20,903;would meet the Dothraki
721;00:43:18,002;00:43:20,903;in an open field.
722;00:43:20,937;00:43:23,773;They leave us
722;00:43:20,937;00:43:23,773;in our castles.
723;00:43:23,807;00:43:27,310;They go from town to town,
723;00:43:23,807;00:43:27,310;looting and burning,
724;00:43:27,344;00:43:31,013;killing every man who can't
724;00:43:27,344;00:43:31,013;hide behind a stone wall,
725;00:43:31,047;00:43:34,083;stealing all our crops
725;00:43:31,047;00:43:34,083;and livestock,
726;00:43:34,117;00:43:36,585;enslaving all our women
726;00:43:34,117;00:43:36,585;and children.
727;00:43:36,619;00:43:39,621;How long do the people of the
727;00:43:36,619;00:43:39,621;Seven Kingdoms stand behind
728;00:43:39,656;00:43:43,058;their absentee King,
728;00:43:39,656;00:43:43,058;their cowardly King
729;00:43:43,092;00:43:45,526;hiding behind high walls?
730;00:43:45,561;00:43:48,396;When do the people decide
730;00:43:45,561;00:43:48,396;that Viserys Targaryen
731;00:43:48,430;00:43:51,065;is the rightful monarch
731;00:43:48,430;00:43:51,065;after all?
732;00:43:52,402;00:43:54,536;We still outnumber them.
733;00:43:56,039;00:43:59,542;Which is the bigger number:
733;00:43:56,039;00:43:59,542;Five or one?
734;00:44:00,444;00:44:02,012;Five.
735;00:44:02,914;00:44:04,682;Five...
736;00:44:06,118;00:44:08,086;One.
737;00:44:08,120;00:44:11,089;One army--
737;00:44:08,120;00:44:11,089;a real army
738;00:44:11,123;00:44:14,392;united behind one leader
738;00:44:11,123;00:44:14,392;with one purpose.
739;00:44:16,228;00:44:20,698;Our purpose died
739;00:44:16,228;00:44:20,698;with the Mad King.
740;00:44:20,732;00:44:22,933;Now we've got
740;00:44:20,732;00:44:22,933;as many armies
741;00:44:22,968;00:44:26,537;as there are men
741;00:44:22,968;00:44:26,537;with gold in their purse.
742;00:44:26,571;00:44:29,039;And everybody wants
742;00:44:26,571;00:44:29,039;something different.
743;00:44:29,074;00:44:31,308;Your father wants
743;00:44:29,074;00:44:31,308;to own the world.
744;00:44:31,343;00:44:34,812;Ned Stark wants to run away
744;00:44:31,343;00:44:34,812;and bury his head in the snow.
745;00:44:34,847;00:44:36,447;What do you want?
746;00:44:46,493;00:44:50,229;We haven't had a real fight
746;00:44:46,493;00:44:50,229;in nine years.
747;00:44:50,263;00:44:52,732;Back-stabbing doesn't
747;00:44:50,263;00:44:52,732;prepare you for a fight.
748;00:44:52,766;00:44:54,967;And that's all
748;00:44:52,766;00:44:54,967;the realm is now:
749;00:44:55,002;00:44:57,137;Back-stabbing
749;00:44:55,002;00:44:57,137;and scheming
750;00:44:57,171;00:45:00,874;and arse-licking
750;00:44:57,171;00:45:00,874;and money-grubbing.
751;00:45:00,908;00:45:04,044;Sometimes I don't know
751;00:45:00,908;00:45:04,044;what holds it together.
752;00:45:04,078;00:45:06,446;Our marriage.
753;00:45:16,457;00:45:18,992;Ah, so here we sit
754;00:45:19,026;00:45:21,294;17 years later,
755;00:45:21,328;00:45:23,963;holding it all together.
756;00:45:25,132;00:45:27,434;Don't you get tired?
757;00:45:27,468;00:45:29,569;Every day.
758;00:45:30,772;00:45:34,242;How long can hate
758;00:45:30,772;00:45:34,242;hold a thing together?
759;00:45:34,276;00:45:38,246;Well, 17 years
759;00:45:34,276;00:45:38,246;is quite a long time.
760;00:45:38,280;00:45:40,414;Yes, it is.
761;00:45:41,550;00:45:43,417;Yes, it is.
762;00:45:48,523;00:45:50,624;What was she like?
763;00:45:52,960;00:45:55,428;You've never asked
763;00:45:52,960;00:45:55,428;about her, not once.
764;00:45:55,463;00:45:57,831;Why not?
765;00:45:57,865;00:46:01,201;At first, just saying
765;00:45:57,865;00:46:01,201;her name even in private
766;00:46:01,236;00:46:04,972;felt like I was breathing
766;00:46:01,236;00:46:04,972;life back into her.
767;00:46:05,006;00:46:07,207;I thought if I didn't
767;00:46:05,006;00:46:07,207;talk about her,
768;00:46:07,241;00:46:09,676;she'd just
768;00:46:07,241;00:46:09,676;fade away for you.
769;00:46:09,711;00:46:12,413;When I realized that
769;00:46:09,711;00:46:12,413;wasn't going to happen,
770;00:46:12,447;00:46:15,149;I refused to ask
770;00:46:12,447;00:46:15,149;out of spite.
771;00:46:15,183;00:46:17,351;I didn't want to give you
771;00:46:15,183;00:46:17,351;the satisfaction
772;00:46:17,386;00:46:20,655;of thinking I cared
772;00:46:17,386;00:46:20,655;enough to ask.
773;00:46:20,690;00:46:24,059;And eventually it became clear that
773;00:46:20,690;00:46:24,059;my spite didn't mean anything to you.
774;00:46:24,094;00:46:26,996;As far as I could tell,
774;00:46:24,094;00:46:26,996;you actually enjoyed it.
775;00:46:27,031;00:46:29,232;So why now?
776;00:46:30,768;00:46:34,737;What harm could Lyanna Stark's
776;00:46:30,768;00:46:34,737;ghost do to either of us
777;00:46:34,771;00:46:37,941;that we haven't done to each other
777;00:46:34,771;00:46:37,941;a hundred times over?
778;00:46:41,879;00:46:44,514;You want to know
778;00:46:41,879;00:46:44,514;the horrible truth?
779;00:46:47,118;00:46:49,753;I can't even remember
779;00:46:47,118;00:46:49,753;what she looked like.
780;00:46:52,590;00:46:57,496;I only know she was the one
780;00:46:52,590;00:46:57,496;thing I ever wanted...
781;00:46:59,132;00:47:03,102;Someone took her
781;00:46:59,132;00:47:03,102;away from me,
782;00:47:03,137;00:47:07,941;and Seven Kingdoms couldn't
782;00:47:03,137;00:47:07,941;fill the hole she left behind.
783;00:47:11,679;00:47:14,381;I felt something
783;00:47:11,679;00:47:14,381;for you once, you know?
784;00:47:15,416;00:47:17,283;I know.
785;00:47:17,318;00:47:20,519;Even after we lost
785;00:47:17,318;00:47:20,519;our first boy.
786;00:47:22,121;00:47:24,222;For quite a while, actually.
787;00:47:28,060;00:47:30,095;Was it ever
787;00:47:28,060;00:47:30,095;possible for us?
788;00:47:30,129;00:47:32,965;Was there ever a time,
788;00:47:30,129;00:47:32,965;ever a moment?
789;00:47:39,706;00:47:41,374;No.
790;00:47:45,380;00:47:48,382;Does that make you feel
790;00:47:45,380;00:47:48,382;better or worse?
791;00:47:52,787;00:47:55,488;It doesn't make me
791;00:47:52,787;00:47:55,488;feel anything.
792;00:48:10,035;00:48:13,338;She looks like him,
792;00:48:10,035;00:48:13,338;don't she, My Lord?
793;00:48:13,372;00:48:17,276;She has his nose,
793;00:48:13,372;00:48:17,276;his black hair.
794;00:48:17,310;00:48:19,278;Aye.
795;00:48:19,312;00:48:21,447;Tell him when you
795;00:48:19,312;00:48:21,447;see him, My Lord.
796;00:48:21,481;00:48:25,498;If it please you,
796;00:48:21,481;00:48:25,498;tell him how beautiful she is.
797;00:48:26,488;00:48:28,133;I will.
798;00:48:28,158;00:48:30,716;And tell him I've been
798;00:48:28,158;00:48:30,716;with no one else.
799;00:48:31,326;00:48:34,628;I swear it, My Lord,
799;00:48:31,326;00:48:34,628;by the old gods and new.
800;00:48:34,662;00:48:36,963;I don't want no jewels
800;00:48:34,662;00:48:36,963;or nothing,
801;00:48:36,998;00:48:38,898;just him.
802;00:48:38,933;00:48:40,834;The King was always
802;00:48:38,933;00:48:40,834;good to me.
803;00:48:40,868;00:48:43,036;When Jon Arryn
803;00:48:40,868;00:48:43,036;came to visit you,
804;00:48:43,070;00:48:44,937;what did he want?
805;00:48:44,972;00:48:47,072;He wasn't that sort
805;00:48:44,972;00:48:47,072;of man, My Lord.
806;00:48:47,107;00:48:50,275;He just wanted to know
806;00:48:47,107;00:48:50,275;if the child was happy,
807;00:48:50,309;00:48:52,477;healthy.
808;00:48:55,014;00:48:57,215;He looks healthy
808;00:48:55,014;00:48:57,215;enough to me.
809;00:48:59,018;00:49:01,319;The girl shall want
809;00:48:59,018;00:49:01,319;for nothing.
810;00:49:07,260;00:49:09,762;Brothels make a much better
810;00:49:07,260;00:49:09,762;investment than ships,
811;00:49:09,796;00:49:11,331;I've found.
812;00:49:11,365;00:49:13,934;Whores rarely sink.
813;00:49:18,140;00:49:21,109;What do you know
813;00:49:18,140;00:49:21,109;of King Robert's bastards?
814;00:49:21,143;00:49:24,446;Well, he has more
814;00:49:21,143;00:49:24,446;than you, for a start.
815;00:49:24,480;00:49:27,049;Ned: How many?
815;00:49:24,480;00:49:27,049;Does it matter?
816;00:49:27,083;00:49:30,152;If you fuck enough women,
816;00:49:27,083;00:49:30,152;some of them will give you presents.
817;00:49:30,186;00:49:32,321;And Jon Arryn tracked
817;00:49:30,186;00:49:32,321;them all down. Why?
818;00:49:32,355;00:49:35,358;He was the King's Hand. Perhaps
818;00:49:32,355;00:49:35,358;Robert wanted them looked after.
819;00:49:35,392;00:49:38,661;He was overcome
819;00:49:35,392;00:49:38,661;with fatherly love.
820;00:49:41,532;00:49:43,199;Come.
821;00:49:49,272;00:49:51,440;Jory!
821;00:49:49,272;00:49:51,440;My Lord.
822;00:50:10,261;00:50:12,628;Such a small pack
822;00:50:10,261;00:50:12,628;of wolves.
823;00:50:14,498;00:50:16,266;Stay back, Ser.
823;00:50:14,498;00:50:16,266;This is the Hand of the King.
824;00:50:16,300;00:50:18,334;Was the Hand
824;00:50:16,300;00:50:18,334;of the King.
825;00:50:18,369;00:50:20,003;Now I'm not sure
825;00:50:18,369;00:50:20,003;what he is--
826;00:50:20,037;00:50:22,439;lord of somewhere
826;00:50:20,037;00:50:22,439;very far away.
827;00:50:22,473;00:50:24,908;What's the meaning
827;00:50:22,473;00:50:24,908;of this, Lannister?
828;00:50:24,942;00:50:27,310;Get back inside
828;00:50:24,942;00:50:27,310;where it's safe.
829;00:50:27,345;00:50:29,045;I'm looking
829;00:50:27,345;00:50:29,045;for my brother.
830;00:50:29,080;00:50:31,114;You remember my brother,
830;00:50:29,080;00:50:31,114;don't you, Lord Stark?
831;00:50:31,148;00:50:34,817;Blond hair,
831;00:50:31,148;00:50:34,817;sharp tongue, short man.
832;00:50:35,986;00:50:37,520;I remember him well.
833;00:50:37,554;00:50:39,555;It seems he had
833;00:50:37,554;00:50:39,555;some trouble on the road.
834;00:50:39,590;00:50:41,924;You wouldn't know what
834;00:50:39,590;00:50:41,924;happened to him, would you?
835;00:50:41,958;00:50:44,226;He was taken at my command
836;00:50:44,260;00:50:46,461;to answer for his crimes.
837;00:50:47,730;00:50:49,597;My lords!
838;00:50:49,631;00:50:51,232;I'll bring the city watch.
839;00:50:53,835;00:50:55,636;Come, Stark.
840;00:50:55,671;00:50:57,071;I'd rather you die
840;00:50:55,671;00:50:57,071;sword in hand.
841;00:50:57,105;00:50:59,740;If you threaten My Lord again--
841;00:50:57,105;00:50:59,740;Threaten?
842;00:50:59,775;00:51:02,743;As in, I'm going
842;00:50:59,775;00:51:02,743;to open your lord
843;00:51:02,777;00:51:06,347;from balls to brains and
843;00:51:02,777;00:51:06,347;see what Starks are made of?
844;00:51:06,381;00:51:08,715;You kill me,
845;00:51:08,750;00:51:11,351;your brother's
845;00:51:08,750;00:51:11,351;a dead man.
846;00:51:11,386;00:51:13,353;You're right.
847;00:51:13,387;00:51:15,822;Take him alive.
847;00:51:13,387;00:51:15,822;Kill his men.
848;00:52:24,459;00:52:26,026;Yah!
849;00:52:50,987;00:52:53,088;My brother, Lord Stark--
850;00:52:53,123;00:52:55,524;we want him back.
