1;00:00:12,170;00:00:13,920;We have won the Great War.
2;00:00:15,045;00:00:16,503;Now we will win the last war.
3;00:00:16,879;00:00:19,003;The objective here is to remove Cersei
4;00:00:19,086;00:00:20,961;without destroying King's Landing.
5;00:00:23,295;00:00:24,920;You heading to King's Landing?
6;00:00:25,128;00:00:26,961;There's some unfinished business.
7;00:00:27,253;00:00:28,170;Me too.
8;00:00:28,420;00:00:30,253;I don't plan on coming back.
9;00:00:31,086;00:00:32,420;Neither do I.
10;00:00:34,045;00:00:37,295;I always wanted to be there
10;00:00:34,045;00:00:37,295;when they execute your sister.
11;00:00:38,253;00:00:39,920;Seems like I won't get the chance.
12;00:00:41,170;00:00:42,712;Stay with me.
13;00:00:43,920;00:00:45,086;Please.
14;00:00:45,503;00:00:46,920;Cersei's hateful...
15;00:00:49,420;00:00:50,462;And so am I.
16;00:00:59,337;00:01:00,795;I need to tell you something.
17;00:01:03,295;00:01:06,253;But you have to swear
17;00:01:03,295;00:01:06,253;you'll never tell another soul.
18;00:01:06,337;00:01:09,420;What if there's someone else?
18;00:01:06,337;00:01:09,420;Someone better.
19;00:01:09,879;00:01:12,629;At a certain point, you choose
19;00:01:09,879;00:01:12,629;a person you believe in,
20;00:01:12,712;00:01:14,045;and you fight for that person.
21;00:01:14,128;00:01:16,337;Even if you know it's a mistake?
22;00:01:19,128;00:01:20,629;He has the better claim to the throne.
23;00:01:20,712;00:01:22,253;Every time a Targaryen is born,
24;00:01:22,337;00:01:23,337;the gods flip a coin.
25;00:01:23,754;00:01:25,337;The Mad King
25;00:01:23,754;00:01:25,337;gave his enemies the justice
26;00:01:25,420;00:01:26,462;he thought they deserved.
27;00:01:26,545;00:01:27,712;Children are not their fathers.
28;00:01:28,337;00:01:29,879;Be a dragon.
28;00:01:28,337;00:01:29,879;You have a gentle heart.
29;00:01:29,961;00:01:32,378;A Targaryen alone in the world
30;00:01:32,462;00:01:33,670;is a terrible thing.
31;00:01:34,003;00:01:35,795;You don't
31;00:01:34,003;00:01:35,795;want to awake the dragon, do you?

36;00:04:14,754;00:04:16,378;She won't eat.

40;00:04:32,378;00:04:36,337;Of course they are.
40;00:04:32,378;00:04:36,337;That's their job.

43;00:04:54,170;00:04:57,045;in the kitchen.

46;00:05:23,879;00:05:26,754;of King's Landing in two days.
47;00:05:27,920;00:05:29,420;How is she?
48;00:05:29,503;00:05:32,128;She hasn't seen anyone
48;00:05:29,503;00:05:32,128;since we returned.
49;00:05:32,211;00:05:35,545;Hasn't left her chambers,

51;00:05:38,545;00:05:41,629;You're worried for her.
51;00:05:38,545;00:05:41,629;I admire your empathy.
52;00:05:41,712;00:05:43,587;Aren't you worried for her?
53;00:05:43,670;00:05:45,795;I'm worried for all of us.
54;00:05:45,879;00:05:48,045;They say every time
54;00:05:45,879;00:05:48,045;a Targaryen is born,
55;00:05:48,128;00:05:51,337;the gods toss a coin
55;00:05:48,128;00:05:51,337;and the world holds its breath.
56;00:05:51,420;00:05:54,170;We're not much for riddles
56;00:05:51,420;00:05:54,170;where I'm from.
57;00:05:54,253;00:05:57,086;We both know what she's about to do.
58;00:06:02,961;00:06:05,086;That's her decision to make.
58;00:06:02,961;00:06:05,086;She is our queen.
59;00:06:05,170;00:06:09,295;Men decide where power resides,

60;00:06:11,837;00:06:13,629;What do you want?
61;00:06:13,712;00:06:15,462;All I've ever wanted.
62;00:06:15,545;00:06:18,462;The right ruler on the Iron Throne.
63;00:06:20,003;00:06:22,837;I still don't know
63;00:06:20,003;00:06:22,837;how her coin has landed.
64;00:06:22,920;00:06:26,253;But I'm quite certain about yours.
65;00:06:34,295;00:06:36,211;I don't want it.
66;00:06:36,295;00:06:37,629;I never have.
67;00:06:40,086;00:06:43,795;I have known more kings
67;00:06:40,086;00:06:43,795;and queens than any man living.
68;00:06:43,879;00:06:45,545;I've heard what they say to crowds,
69;00:06:45,629;00:06:47,462;and seen what they do in the shadows.
70;00:06:47,545;00:06:50,920;I have furthered their designs,
70;00:06:47,545;00:06:50,920;however horrible.
71;00:06:51,003;00:06:53,712;But what I tell you now is true:
72;00:06:53,795;00:06:57,003;You will rule wisely and well,
72;00:06:53,795;00:06:57,003;while she--
73;00:06:57,086;00:06:58,879;She...
74;00:06:58,961;00:07:00,045;is my queen.
75;00:07:21,879;00:07:23,337;Your Grace?
76;00:07:48,545;00:07:51,003;There's something you need to know.
77;00:07:52,295;00:07:54,545;Someone has betrayed me.
78;00:08:00,712;00:08:02,086;Yes.
79;00:08:06,045;00:08:07,837;Jon Snow.
80;00:08:13,712;00:08:14,670;Varys.
81;00:08:16,879;00:08:19,003;He knows the truth about Jon.
82;00:08:20,295;00:08:21,837;He does.
83;00:08:26,587;00:08:28,920;Because you told him.
84;00:08:31,211;00:08:32,961;You learned from Sansa.
85;00:08:33,920;00:08:35,587;And she learned from Jon,
86;00:08:35,670;00:08:38,253;though I begged him not to tell her.
87;00:08:39,629;00:08:41,462;As I said...
88;00:08:42,211;00:08:43,295;he betrayed me.
89;00:08:43,378;00:08:45,211;I'm glad Sansa told me.
90;00:08:45,295;00:08:46,837;I am your Hand.
91;00:08:46,920;00:08:49,420;I need to be aware
91;00:08:46,920;00:08:49,420;of any threats you're facing.
92;00:08:50,920;00:08:52,211;And Varys?
93;00:08:52,295;00:08:55,420;Your Master of Whisperers
93;00:08:52,295;00:08:55,420;needs to be aware too.
94;00:08:56,253;00:08:58,670;You spoke to him first.
95;00:08:58,754;00:09:00,003;Without coming to me.
96;00:09:00,086;00:09:02,545;Without asking my permission.
97;00:09:04,170;00:09:06,795;It was a mistake.
98;00:09:08,795;00:09:11,587;Why do you think Sansa told you?
99;00:09:11,670;00:09:13,378;What do you think she hoped to gain?
100;00:09:13,462;00:09:17,086;She trusts me.
100;00:09:13,462;00:09:17,086;Yes, she trusts you.
101;00:09:18,211;00:09:22,295;She trusted you to spread secrets
102;00:09:22,378;00:09:25,462;that could destroy your own queen.
103;00:09:27,462;00:09:29,754;And you did not let her down.
104;00:09:33,420;00:09:36,961;If I have failed you, my queen,
104;00:09:33,420;00:09:36,961;forgive me.
105;00:09:38,837;00:09:41,128;Our intentions were good.
106;00:09:42,545;00:09:46,128;We wanted what you want.
106;00:09:42,545;00:09:46,128;A better world, all of us.
107;00:09:47,378;00:09:50,211;Varys as much as anyone.
108;00:09:58,920;00:10:01,045;But it doesn't matter now.
109;00:10:03,211;00:10:04,170;No.
110;00:10:05,503;00:10:07,170;It doesn't matter now.
111;00:12:07,629;00:12:09,587;It was me.
112;00:12:14,961;00:12:16,587;I hope I deserve this.
113;00:12:16,670;00:12:18,337;Truly, I do.
114;00:12:18,420;00:12:20,503;I hope I'm wrong.
115;00:12:28,045;00:12:29,128;Goodbye, old friend.
116;00:13:10,629;00:13:11,712;Lord Varys.
117;00:13:13,462;00:13:15,629;I, Daenerys of House Targaryen,
118;00:13:15,712;00:13:17,545;First of My Name,
119;00:13:17,629;00:13:20,879;Breaker of Chains
119;00:13:17,629;00:13:20,879;and Mother of Dragons...
120;00:13:22,712;00:13:24,754;sentence you to die.
121;00:13:35,253;00:13:36,378;Dracarys.
122;00:14:27,545;00:14:29,128;This was all she brought with her
123;00:14:29,211;00:14:31,128;when we crossed the Narrow Sea.
124;00:14:32,211;00:14:34,253;Her only possession.
125;00:15:18,961;00:15:21,170;_
126;00:15:21,290;00:15:22,652;_
127;00:15:49,961;00:15:52,587;What did I say would
127;00:15:49,961;00:15:52,587;happen if you told your sister?
128;00:15:52,670;00:15:55,961;I don't want it,
128;00:15:52,670;00:15:55,961;and that's what I told him.
129;00:15:57,253;00:15:59,462;She betrayed your trust.
130;00:15:59,545;00:16:01,295;She killed Varys as much as I did.
131;00:16:02,920;00:16:05,378;This was a victory for her.
132;00:16:06,879;00:16:08,086;Now she knows what happens
133;00:16:08,170;00:16:10,086;when people hear the truth about you.
134;00:16:12,712;00:16:16,712;Far more people in Westeros
134;00:16:12,712;00:16:16,712;love you than love me.
135;00:16:19,211;00:16:21,587;I don't have love here.
136;00:16:23,045;00:16:25,086;I only have fear.
137;00:16:28,003;00:16:29,879;I love you.
138;00:16:32,420;00:16:35,211;And you will always be my queen.
139;00:16:42,045;00:16:44,045;Is that all I am to you?
140;00:16:45,795;00:16:47,754;Your queen?
141;00:17:24,629;00:17:26,587;All right, then.
142;00:17:33,961;00:17:35,795;Let it be fear.
143;00:17:39,795;00:17:43,045;The people who live
143;00:17:39,795;00:17:43,045;there, they're not your enemies.
144;00:17:43,128;00:17:45,879;They're innocents, like the ones
144;00:17:43,128;00:17:45,879;you liberated in Meereen.
145;00:17:45,961;00:17:47,879;In Meereen,
145;00:17:45,961;00:17:47,879;the slaves turned on the masters
146;00:17:47,961;00:17:51,045;and liberated the city
146;00:17:47,961;00:17:51,045;themselves the moment I arrived.
147;00:17:51,128;00:17:52,337;They're afraid.
148;00:17:52,420;00:17:53,670;Anyone who resists Cersei
149;00:17:53,754;00:17:55,879;will see his family butchered.
150;00:17:55,961;00:17:58,170;You can't expect them to be heroes.
151;00:17:58,253;00:18:00,378;They're hostages.
151;00:17:58,253;00:18:00,378;They are.
152;00:18:00,462;00:18:03,795;In a tyrant's grip.
152;00:18:00,462;00:18:03,795;Whose fault is that? Mine?
153;00:18:03,879;00:18:06,503;What does it matter whose fault it is?
154;00:18:06,587;00:18:09,462;Thousands of children will die
154;00:18:06,587;00:18:09,462;if the city burns.
155;00:18:09,545;00:18:10,795;Your sister knows how to use
156;00:18:10,879;00:18:12,920;her enemies' weaknesses against them.
157;00:18:13,003;00:18:15,420;That's what she thinks our mercy is:
158;00:18:15,503;00:18:16,670;weakness.
159;00:18:16,754;00:18:18,837;I beg you, my queen--
159;00:18:16,754;00:18:18,837;But she's wrong.
160;00:18:19,712;00:18:21,503;Mercy is our strength.
161;00:18:22,754;00:18:25,128;Our mercy towards future generations
162;00:18:25,211;00:18:27,795;who will never again
162;00:18:25,211;00:18:27,795;be held hostage by a tyrant.
163;00:18:33,754;00:18:35,378;Ready the Unsullied.
164;00:18:35,462;00:18:37,003;Tonight you sail for King's Landing
165;00:18:37,086;00:18:38,920;to join the Northern armies.
165;00:18:37,086;00:18:38,920;Cersei's followers
166;00:18:39,003;00:18:40,879;will abandon her
166;00:18:39,003;00:18:40,879;if they know the war is lost.
167;00:18:40,961;00:18:42,128;Give them that chance.
168;00:18:42,211;00:18:44,503;If the city surrenders,
169;00:18:44,587;00:18:46,629;they will ring the bells
169;00:18:44,587;00:18:46,629;and raise the gates.
170;00:18:46,712;00:18:50,378;Please, if you hear them ringing
170;00:18:46,712;00:18:50,378;the bells, call off the attack.
171;00:18:58,545;00:19:00,545;Wait for me outside the city.
172;00:19:01,629;00:19:03,337;You'll know when it's time.
173;00:19:32,879;00:19:36,754;Your brother was stopped
173;00:19:32,879;00:19:36,754;trying to get past our lines.
174;00:19:41,086;00:19:44,587;It seems he hasn't abandoned
174;00:19:41,086;00:19:44,587;your sister after all.
175;00:19:50,295;00:19:51,920;The next time you fail me...
176;00:19:53,295;00:19:55,754;will be the last time you fail me.
177;00:20:12,545;00:20:14,545;Let them pass.
178;00:20:25,961;00:20:27,545;Through the gate.
179;00:20:27,629;00:20:28,961;Get going.
180;00:21:10,545;00:21:13,462;The rearguard
180;00:21:10,545;00:21:13,462;should be here by daybreak.
181;00:21:13,545;00:21:16,003;She wants to attack now.
182;00:21:17,211;00:21:18,670;Daybreak at the earliest.
183;00:21:20,170;00:21:23,337;Careful with that.
183;00:21:20,170;00:21:23,337;My lord.
184;00:21:25,795;00:21:27,003;Davos.
185;00:21:29,587;00:21:31,879;I need to ask you a favor.
186;00:21:34,003;00:21:36,503;You're the greatest smuggler
186;00:21:34,003;00:21:36,503;alive, aren't you?
187;00:21:38,045;00:21:41,420;I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?
188;00:21:41,503;00:21:43,961;He's always better
188;00:21:41,503;00:21:43,961;when he's got some food in him.
189;00:21:44,045;00:21:47,211;Problem is when he's got drink in him.
190;00:21:47,295;00:21:48,754;See what he did the other week?
191;00:21:48,837;00:21:50,420;Aye. Fighting as well.
192;00:21:50,503;00:21:51,879;Commander nearly caught him.
193;00:21:51,961;00:21:54,837;Ay up. Where you going?
194;00:21:56,253;00:21:58,253;I'm Arya Stark.
195;00:21:58,337;00:22:00,879;I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.
196;00:22:05,378;00:22:06,378;Think about it.
197;00:22:06,462;00:22:09,086;She kills Cersei, the war's over.
198;00:22:09,170;00:22:12,545;There won't be a siege.
198;00:22:09,170;00:22:12,545;You might not even die tomorrow.
199;00:22:15,837;00:22:17,670;I need to go talk to my captain.
200;00:22:17,754;00:22:19,754;Go ahead, talk to him.
201;00:22:22,503;00:22:24,211;Where's he going?
202;00:22:38,253;00:22:41,754;_
203;00:22:43,434;00:22:46,325;_
204;00:22:50,871;00:22:53,991;_
205;00:22:54,337;00:22:55,920;We speak the common tongue.
206;00:22:56,920;00:22:58,837;Ah. Good.
207;00:22:58,920;00:23:00,670;I want to be alone with the prisoner.
208;00:23:00,754;00:23:02,920;Get some rest.
208;00:23:00,754;00:23:02,920;Tomorrow will be a long day.
209;00:23:03,003;00:23:05,378;We have orders to guard the prisoner.
210;00:23:05,462;00:23:07,253;Ordered by whom?
210;00:23:05,462;00:23:07,253;The queen herself?
211;00:23:08,462;00:23:10,420;No.
211;00:23:08,462;00:23:10,420;Well, in that case,
212;00:23:10,503;00:23:13,462;as Hand of the Queen, I outrank
212;00:23:10,503;00:23:13,462;whomever gave your order.
213;00:23:13,545;00:23:15,086;Probably by quite a lot.
214;00:23:38,795;00:23:40,795;How did they find you?
215;00:23:48,961;00:23:51,378;Did you consider taking it off?
216;00:23:52,837;00:23:56,295;Cersei once called me
216;00:23:52,837;00:23:56,295;the stupidest Lannister.
217;00:23:57,795;00:24:01,045;And you're going back to her,
217;00:23:57,795;00:24:01,045;to die with her.
218;00:24:02,211;00:24:03,837;You've underestimated her before.
219;00:24:03,920;00:24:05,295;She's going to die.
220;00:24:06,462;00:24:07,879;Unless you can convince her
221;00:24:07,961;00:24:09,587;to change her course of action.
222;00:24:09,670;00:24:11,670;Difficult to do from here.
223;00:24:17,295;00:24:20,420;When have I ever been able
223;00:24:17,295;00:24:20,420;to convince Cersei of anything?
224;00:24:20,503;00:24:22,086;Try.
225;00:24:22,170;00:24:24,128;If not for yourself, if not for her,
226;00:24:24,211;00:24:26,961;then for every one of the
226;00:24:24,211;00:24:26,961;million people in that city,
227;00:24:27,045;00:24:28,378;innocent or otherwise.
228;00:24:28,462;00:24:31,462;To be honest, I never really
228;00:24:28,462;00:24:31,462;cared much for them.
229;00:24:31,545;00:24:33,211;Innocent or otherwise.
230;00:24:34,545;00:24:36,670;You do care for one innocent.
231;00:24:37,587;00:24:39,086;I know you do.
232;00:24:39,170;00:24:40,920;And so does Cersei.
233;00:24:42,211;00:24:43,920;She has a reason now.
234;00:24:45,378;00:24:49,128;The child is the reason
234;00:24:45,378;00:24:49,128;she'll never give an inch.
235;00:24:49,211;00:24:51,003;All the worst things she's ever done,
236;00:24:51,086;00:24:53,462;she's done for her children.
237;00:24:53,545;00:24:55,712;It's not impossible that she'll win.
238;00:24:55,795;00:24:57,003;She won't.
239;00:24:57,086;00:24:58,961;Her enemy's forces have been depleted,
240;00:24:59,045;00:25:00,420;as she said they would be.
241;00:25:00,503;00:25:02,754;Two of the three dragons are dead.
242;00:25:02,837;00:25:05,378;She's evened the odds.
242;00:25:02,837;00:25:05,378;The city will fall tomorrow.
243;00:25:05,462;00:25:07,378;She has the Lannister army,
243;00:25:05,462;00:25:07,378;she has the Golden Company--
244;00:25:07,462;00:25:09,170;I defended the city
244;00:25:07,462;00:25:09,170;last time it was attacked.
245;00:25:09,253;00:25:11,837;I know it better than anyone.
245;00:25:09,253;00:25:11,837;It will fall tomorrow.
246;00:25:11,920;00:25:14,170;Then I suppose I'll die
246;00:25:11,920;00:25:14,170;tomorrow, if not before.
247;00:25:14,253;00:25:15,920;Why?
248;00:25:22,128;00:25:23,629;Escape.
249;00:25:23,712;00:25:25,712;The two of you, together.
250;00:25:25,795;00:25:27,045;Remember where we met,
251;00:25:27,128;00:25:28,795;where they keep the dragon skulls,
252;00:25:28,879;00:25:29,920;beneath the Red Keep?
253;00:25:31,587;00:25:32,879;Take her down there.
254;00:25:32,961;00:25:34,629;Keep following the stairways down,
255;00:25:34,712;00:25:36,086;down as far as they'll go.
256;00:25:36,170;00:25:38,503;You'll come out onto a beach
256;00:25:36,170;00:25:38,503;at the foot of the keep.
257;00:25:38,587;00:25:40,545;A dinghy will be waiting for you.
258;00:25:41,754;00:25:43,128;Sail out of the bay.
259;00:25:43,211;00:25:45,920;If the winds are kind,
259;00:25:43,211;00:25:45,920;you'll make it to Pentos.
260;00:25:47,086;00:25:49,503;Start a new life.
261;00:25:52,837;00:25:56,170;Sail right past the Iron Fleet
261;00:25:52,837;00:25:56,170;and into a new life?
262;00:25:56,253;00:25:58,920;Sounds a lot less likely
262;00:25:56,253;00:25:58,920;than Cersei winning this war--
263;00:25:59,003;00:26:01,629;There won't be an Iron Fleet
263;00:25:59,003;00:26:01,629;for much longer.
264;00:26:02,837;00:26:04,086;Do it.
265;00:26:04,170;00:26:07,295;If you don't,
265;00:26:04,170;00:26:07,295;you'll never see Cersei again.
266;00:26:13,170;00:26:14,961;Swear to me.
267;00:26:18,253;00:26:20,170;You have my word.
268;00:26:24,795;00:26:26,211;If it works,
269;00:26:26,295;00:26:27,961;give the order to ring all the bells
270;00:26:28,045;00:26:29,795;in King's Landing and open the gates.
271;00:26:29,879;00:26:32,670;That will be our signal
271;00:26:29,879;00:26:32,670;that the city has surrendered.
272;00:26:32,754;00:26:34,211;I'll try.
273;00:26:35,629;00:26:38,003;I never thought
273;00:26:35,629;00:26:38,003;I'd get to repay the favor.
274;00:26:38,086;00:26:40,795;Remember, ring the bells
274;00:26:38,086;00:26:40,795;and open the gates.
275;00:26:40,879;00:26:43,420;Your queen will execute you for this.
276;00:26:43,503;00:26:45,253;If Daenerys can make it to the throne
277;00:26:45,337;00:26:47,337;without wading through
277;00:26:45,337;00:26:47,337;a river of blood,
278;00:26:47,420;00:26:48,545;maybe she'll show mercy
279;00:26:48,629;00:26:50,837;to the person who made that possible.
280;00:26:56,587;00:26:59,337;Tens of thousands of innocent lives...
281;00:27:00,629;00:27:03,837;one not particularly innocent dwarf...
282;00:27:05,253;00:27:07,837;it seems like a fair trade.
283;00:27:14,378;00:27:16,378;If it weren't for you,
284;00:27:16,462;00:27:18,629;I never would've survived my childhood.
285;00:27:20,754;00:27:22,587;You would have.
286;00:27:30,211;00:27:31,754;You were the only one
287;00:27:32,961;00:27:35,879;who didn't treat me like a monster.
288;00:27:38,462;00:27:40,712;You were all I had.
289;00:28:51,587;00:28:54,003;Eyes on the horizon!
290;00:28:55,295;00:28:57,295;Load the scorpion!
291;00:29:10,545;00:29:11,961;Archers, close up!
292;00:29:12,045;00:29:13,420;Come on!
293;00:29:13,503;00:29:15,503;Up to the espringal!
294;00:29:15,587;00:29:17,795;To the back of it!
295;00:29:29,754;00:29:31,462;Archers, line up!
296;00:29:39,503;00:29:41,003;This way! Come on!
297;00:29:41,086;00:29:42,670;Clear the streets now!
298;00:29:42,754;00:29:45,003;No!
298;00:29:42,754;00:29:45,003;In, now.
299;00:29:45,086;00:29:47,754;And you, come on.
299;00:29:45,086;00:29:47,754;Inside, now!
300;00:29:47,837;00:29:49,253;Quickly.
301;00:29:49,337;00:29:50,420;Yes. Follow down there.
302;00:29:50,503;00:29:52,295;They're here.
302;00:29:50,503;00:29:52,295;Get to the Red Keep.
303;00:29:54,003;00:29:55,961;My son!
303;00:29:54,003;00:29:55,961;Get inside!
304;00:30:00,295;00:30:02,211;Just ahead of you, I can see it!
305;00:30:02,295;00:30:03,629;All right, move it!
306;00:30:03,712;00:30:05,545;Come on!
306;00:30:03,712;00:30:05,545;Keep moving!
307;00:30:05,629;00:30:07,295;Keep going!
307;00:30:05,629;00:30:07,295;Keep moving!
308;00:30:07,378;00:30:09,128;Quickly!
308;00:30:07,378;00:30:09,128;All the way!
309;00:30:09,211;00:30:11,128;Come on!
309;00:30:09,211;00:30:11,128;Come on!
310;00:30:11,211;00:30:13,337;Hold your mother's hand!
311;00:30:26,086;00:30:30,003;Make way for the Golden Company!
312;00:30:39,045;00:30:40,295;Close the gate!
313;00:31:44,754;00:31:47,795;If you hear the bells ring,
313;00:31:44,754;00:31:47,795;they've surrendered.
314;00:31:47,879;00:31:49,795;Call off your men.
315;00:32:02,128;00:32:04,378;Move along now, lads.
316;00:32:33,128;00:32:35,712;That's it.
316;00:32:33,128;00:32:35,712;Go on, move it.
317;00:32:38,961;00:32:42,211;Come on, move, move.
317;00:32:38,961;00:32:42,211;Faster, faster. Come on, move it.
318;00:32:42,295;00:32:44,128;Keep going.
318;00:32:42,295;00:32:44,128;Keep moving.

406;00:51:23,503;00:51:26,961;That's the sound of a city dying.

408;00:51:30,170;00:51:32,003;Well, maybe for you.
409;00:51:33,295;00:51:36,337;If you kill another king
409;00:51:33,295;00:51:36,337;before you die...
410;00:51:37,545;00:51:39,295;they'll sing about you forever.

415;00:51:52,961;00:51:54,420;I'll bring your head to Cersei

422;00:54:39,545;00:54:41,503;You fought well...
423;00:54:42,503;00:54:43,879;for a cripple.
424;00:55:28,211;00:55:29,545;Another king for you.
425;00:55:44,795;00:55:45,795;But I got you!
426;00:55:49,045;00:55:50,086;I got you!
427;00:55:56,587;00:55:59,420;I'm the man who killed Jaime Lannister.

429;00:56:26,086;00:56:27,670;The fire will get her,
430;00:56:27,754;00:56:29,503;or one of the Dothraki.
431;00:56:30,754;00:56:33,462;Or maybe that dragon will eat her.
432;00:56:33,545;00:56:35,545;It doesn't matter. She's dead.
433;00:56:35,629;00:56:38,420;And you'll be dead too
433;00:56:35,629;00:56:38,420;if you don't get out of here.
434;00:56:39,462;00:56:40,837;I'm going to kill her.
435;00:56:42,378;00:56:45,211;You think you wanted revenge
435;00:56:42,378;00:56:45,211;a long time?
436;00:56:45,295;00:56:46,920;I've been after it all my life.
437;00:56:47,003;00:56:49,170;It's all I care about.
438;00:56:49,253;00:56:51,629;And look at me. Look at me!
439;00:56:53,629;00:56:55,961;You wanna be like me?
440;00:57:02,795;00:57:07,003;You come with me, you die here.
