3;00:02:40,335;00:02:43,871;The little lord's
3;00:02:40,335;00:02:43,871;been dreaming again.
4;00:02:49,977;00:02:53,480;We have visitors.
4;00:02:49,977;00:02:53,480;I don't want to see anyone.
5;00:02:53,515;00:02:56,517;Really?
5;00:02:53,515;00:02:56,517;If I was cooped up all day
6;00:02:56,551;00:02:59,620;with no one but this old bat
6;00:02:56,551;00:02:59,620;for company, I'd go mad.
7;00:03:00,956;00:03:03,224;Anyway, you don't have a choice.
7;00:03:00,956;00:03:03,224;Robb's waiting.
8;00:03:03,258;00:03:06,260;I don't want to go.
8;00:03:03,258;00:03:06,260;Neither do I.
9;00:03:06,295;00:03:08,196;But Robb's
9;00:03:06,295;00:03:08,196;Lord of Winterfell,
10;00:03:08,230;00:03:11,366;which means I do what he says,
10;00:03:08,230;00:03:11,366;and you do what I say.
11;00:03:12,702;00:03:15,103;Hodor!
12;00:03:18,140;00:03:21,142;Hodor?
12;00:03:18,140;00:03:21,142;Help Bran down the hall.
13;00:03:21,177;00:03:23,278;Hodor.
14;00:03:29,119;00:03:32,922;I must say I received a slightly
14;00:03:29,119;00:03:32,922;warmer welcome on my last visit.
15;00:03:32,956;00:03:35,458;Any man of The Night's Watch
15;00:03:32,956;00:03:35,458;is welcome at Winterfell.
16;00:03:35,493;00:03:38,695;Any man of The Night's Watch,
16;00:03:35,493;00:03:38,695;but not I, eh, boy?
17;00:03:38,730;00:03:40,664;I'm not your boy,
17;00:03:38,730;00:03:40,664;Lannister.
18;00:03:40,699;00:03:42,667;I'm Lord of Winterfell
18;00:03:40,699;00:03:42,667;while my father is away.
19;00:03:42,701;00:03:46,204;Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.
20;00:03:48,274;00:03:50,142;So it's true.
21;00:03:52,011;00:03:54,245;Hello, Bran.
22;00:03:54,280;00:03:56,614;Do you remember anything
22;00:03:54,280;00:03:56,614;about what happened?
23;00:03:56,648;00:03:59,250;He has no memory
23;00:03:56,648;00:03:59,250;of that day.
24;00:03:59,284;00:04:01,718;Curious.
24;00:03:59,284;00:04:01,718;Why are you here
25;00:04:01,752;00:04:05,921;would your charming companion
25;00:04:01,752;00:04:05,921;be so kind as to kneel?
26;00:04:05,956;00:04:09,691;My neck is beginning to hurt.
26;00:04:05,956;00:04:09,691;Kneel, Hodor.
27;00:04:12,395;00:04:14,930;Do you like to ride, Bran?
27;00:04:12,395;00:04:14,930;Yes.
28;00:04:14,964;00:04:17,366;Well, I mean
28;00:04:14,964;00:04:17,366;I did like to.
29;00:04:17,401;00:04:19,636;The boy has lost the use of his legs.
29;00:04:17,401;00:04:19,636;What of it?
30;00:04:19,670;00:04:21,938;With the right horse and saddle,
30;00:04:19,670;00:04:21,938;even a cripple can ride.
31;00:04:21,973;00:04:25,009;I'm not a cripple.
31;00:04:21,973;00:04:25,009;Then I'm not a dwarf.
32;00:04:25,043;00:04:27,078;My father will
32;00:04:25,043;00:04:27,078;rejoice to hear it.
33;00:04:27,112;00:04:29,714;I have a gift
33;00:04:27,112;00:04:29,714;for you.
34;00:04:29,749;00:04:32,284;Give that to your saddler.
34;00:04:29,749;00:04:32,284;He'll provide the rest.
35;00:04:34,453;00:04:36,888;You must shape
35;00:04:34,453;00:04:36,888;the horse to the rider.
36;00:04:36,922;00:04:38,990;Start with a yearling
36;00:04:36,922;00:04:38,990;and teach it to respond
37;00:04:39,024;00:04:40,958;to the reins
37;00:04:39,024;00:04:40,958;and to the boy's voice.
38;00:04:42,227;00:04:43,894;Will I really be
38;00:04:42,227;00:04:43,894;able to ride?
39;00:04:43,929;00:04:45,496;You will.
40;00:04:45,530;00:04:47,864;On horseback you will be
40;00:04:45,530;00:04:47,864;as tall as any of them.
41;00:04:47,898;00:04:51,167;Is this some kind of trick?
41;00:04:47,898;00:04:51,167;Why do you want to help him?
42;00:04:51,201;00:04:52,902;I have a tender spot
42;00:04:51,201;00:04:52,902;in my heart
43;00:04:52,937;00:04:55,839;for cripples, bastards
43;00:04:52,937;00:04:55,839;and broken things.
44;00:04:57,075;00:04:58,976;You've done my brother
44;00:04:57,075;00:04:58,976;a kindness.
45;00:04:59,011;00:05:01,313;The hospitality
45;00:04:59,011;00:05:01,313;of Winterfell is yours.
46;00:05:01,347;00:05:04,182;Spare me your false courtesies,
46;00:05:01,347;00:05:04,182;Lord Stark.
47;00:05:04,216;00:05:06,418;There's a brothel
47;00:05:04,216;00:05:06,418;outside your walls.
48;00:05:06,452;00:05:09,354;There I'll find a bed and both
48;00:05:06,452;00:05:09,354;of us can sleep easier.
49;00:05:14,460;00:05:17,029;Couldn't resist
49;00:05:14,460;00:05:17,029;some Northern ass?
50;00:05:17,063;00:05:19,832;If you like redheads,
50;00:05:17,063;00:05:19,832;ask for Ros.
51;00:05:19,866;00:05:22,735;Come to see me off, Greyjoy?
51;00:05:19,866;00:05:22,735;Kind of you.
52;00:05:22,769;00:05:25,304;Your master doesn't seem
52;00:05:22,769;00:05:25,304;to like Lannisters.
53;00:05:25,338;00:05:28,274;He's not my master.
53;00:05:25,338;00:05:28,274;No, of course not.
54;00:05:28,308;00:05:30,276;What happened here?
55;00:05:30,310;00:05:32,678;Where is Lady Stark?
55;00:05:30,310;00:05:32,678;Why didn't she receive me?
56;00:05:32,712;00:05:35,581;She wasn't feeling well.
56;00:05:32,712;00:05:35,581;She's not in Winterfell, is she?
57;00:05:35,615;00:05:37,816;Where did she go?
57;00:05:35,615;00:05:37,816;My Lady's whereabouts--
58;00:05:37,850;00:05:39,518;My Lady?
59;00:05:39,553;00:05:42,956;Your loyalty to your captors
59;00:05:39,553;00:05:42,956;is touching.
60;00:05:42,990;00:05:46,192;Tell me, how do you think
60;00:05:42,990;00:05:46,192;balon Greyjoy would feel
61;00:05:46,226;00:05:49,161;if he could see his only
61;00:05:46,226;00:05:49,161;surviving son has turned lackey?
62;00:05:50,330;00:05:52,531;I still remember seeing
62;00:05:50,330;00:05:52,531;my father's fleet
63;00:05:52,566;00:05:54,166;burn in Lannisport.
64;00:05:54,201;00:05:56,102;I believe your uncles
64;00:05:54,201;00:05:56,102;were responsible?
65;00:05:56,136;00:05:57,404;Must have been a pretty sight.
66;00:05:57,429;00:05:59,846;Nothing prettier than watching
66;00:05:57,429;00:05:59,846;sailors burn alive.
67;00:05:59,974;00:06:03,343;Yes, a great victory
67;00:05:59,974;00:06:03,343;for your people.
68;00:06:03,378;00:06:07,081;Shame how it all turned out.
68;00:06:03,378;00:06:07,081;We were outnumbered 10 to one--
69;00:06:07,116;00:06:09,150;a stupid rebellion then.
70;00:06:09,185;00:06:11,186;I suppose your father
70;00:06:09,185;00:06:11,186;realized that
71;00:06:11,220;00:06:13,722;when your brothers
71;00:06:11,220;00:06:13,722;died in battle.
72;00:06:13,756;00:06:17,126;Now here you are,
72;00:06:13,756;00:06:17,126;your enemy's squire.
73;00:06:17,160;00:06:18,994;Careful, imp.
73;00:06:17,160;00:06:18,994;I've offended you.
74;00:06:19,028;00:06:22,331;Forgive me, it's been
74;00:06:19,028;00:06:22,331;a rough morning.
75;00:06:22,365;00:06:25,767;Anyway, don't despair.
76;00:06:25,802;00:06:28,237;I'm a constant disappointment
76;00:06:25,802;00:06:28,237;to my own father
77;00:06:28,271;00:06:30,005;and I've learned
77;00:06:28,271;00:06:30,005;to live with it.
78;00:06:30,040;00:06:32,908;Your next tumble with Ros is on me.
79;00:06:32,943;00:06:36,211;I'll try not
79;00:06:32,943;00:06:36,211;to wear her out.
80;00:06:40,583;00:06:43,485;Shoulder, legs.
81;00:06:47,857;00:06:51,459;Leg, shoulder, leg.
82;00:06:52,528;00:06:54,395;Left foot forward.
82;00:06:52,528;00:06:54,395;Good.
83;00:06:54,429;00:06:56,831;Now pivot as you
83;00:06:54,429;00:06:56,831;deliver the stroke.
84;00:06:56,865;00:06:58,533;Put all your weight
84;00:06:56,865;00:06:58,533;behind it.
85;00:06:58,567;00:07:00,901;What in seven hells
85;00:06:58,567;00:07:00,901;is that?
86;00:07:00,936;00:07:03,471;They'll need an eighth hell
86;00:07:00,936;00:07:03,471;to fit him in.
87;00:07:05,741;00:07:07,675;Tell them
87;00:07:05,741;00:07:07,675;your name.
88;00:07:07,710;00:07:09,910;Samwell Tarly,
89;00:07:09,945;00:07:12,246;of Horn Hill--
89;00:07:09,945;00:07:12,246;I mean, I was of Horn Hill.
90;00:07:13,849;00:07:17,218;I've come to take the black.
90;00:07:13,849;00:07:17,218;Come to take the black pudding.
91;00:07:18,079;00:07:19,834;Well, you couldn't be
91;00:07:18,079;00:07:19,834;any worse than you look.
92;00:07:20,389;00:07:22,056;Rast...
93;00:07:23,692;00:07:25,292;See what he can do.
94;00:07:32,900;00:07:35,201;I yield.
95;00:07:35,236;00:07:38,171;Please, no more.
95;00:07:35,236;00:07:38,171;On your feet.
96;00:07:38,205;00:07:40,239;Pick up your sword.
97;00:07:40,274;00:07:42,875;Hit him till he
97;00:07:40,274;00:07:42,875;finds his feet.
98;00:07:52,219;00:07:54,654;It seems they've run short of
98;00:07:52,219;00:07:54,654;poachers and thieves down South.
99;00:07:54,689;00:07:57,557;Now they send us squealing bloody pigs.
99;00:07:54,689;00:07:57,557;Jon!
100;00:07:57,592;00:08:00,160;Again, harder.
101;00:08:00,194;00:08:02,062;I yield!
102;00:08:02,096;00:08:03,597;Enough!
103;00:08:03,631;00:08:06,900;He yielded.
104;00:08:08,469;00:08:10,537;Looks like
104;00:08:08,469;00:08:10,537;the bastard's in love.
105;00:08:13,374;00:08:15,241;All right then,
105;00:08:13,374;00:08:15,241;Lord Snow,
106;00:08:15,275;00:08:18,511;you wish to defend your lady love,
106;00:08:15,275;00:08:18,511;let's make it an exercise.
107;00:08:18,545;00:08:21,648;You two. Three of you ought
107;00:08:18,545;00:08:21,648;to be sufficient
108;00:08:21,682;00:08:23,983;to make
108;00:08:21,682;00:08:23,983;lady piggy squeal.
109;00:08:24,017;00:08:27,086;All you've got to do is
109;00:08:24,017;00:08:27,086;get past the bastard.
110;00:08:29,056;00:08:31,690;Are you sure you want to do this?
110;00:08:29,056;00:08:31,690;No.
111;00:08:45,506;00:08:48,408;Yield yield yield!
111;00:08:45,506;00:08:48,408;I yield.
112;00:08:50,478;00:08:52,179;We're done
112;00:08:50,478;00:08:52,179;for today.
113;00:08:52,213;00:08:53,947;Go clean the armory.
114;00:08:53,982;00:08:55,748;That's all
114;00:08:53,982;00:08:55,748;you're good for.
115;00:08:59,653;00:09:02,388;Well fought!
115;00:08:59,653;00:09:02,388;Piss off.
116;00:09:06,192;00:09:07,926;Did he hurt you?
117;00:09:07,960;00:09:10,161;I've had worse.
118;00:09:11,330;00:09:13,999;You can call me Sam...
118;00:09:11,330;00:09:13,999;If you want.
119;00:09:14,034;00:09:17,736;My mother calls me Sam--
119;00:09:14,034;00:09:17,736;it's not going to get any easier, you know?
120;00:09:17,771;00:09:20,006;You're going to have
120;00:09:17,771;00:09:20,006;to defend yourself.
121;00:09:20,040;00:09:21,941;Why didn't you get up
121;00:09:20,040;00:09:21,941;and fight?
122;00:09:21,975;00:09:25,278;I wanted to.
123;00:09:25,313;00:09:27,681;I just couldn't.
123;00:09:25,313;00:09:27,681;Why not?
124;00:09:29,484;00:09:31,552;I'm a coward.
125;00:09:33,355;00:09:36,156;My father always says so.
125;00:09:33,355;00:09:36,156;The Wall's no place for cowards.
126;00:09:36,191;00:09:38,258;You're right.
126;00:09:36,191;00:09:38,258;I'm sorry.
127;00:09:38,293;00:09:41,427;I just... wanted
127;00:09:38,293;00:09:41,427;to thank you.
128;00:09:52,105;00:09:54,140;A bloody coward.
129;00:09:54,174;00:09:56,242;People saw us
129;00:09:54,174;00:09:56,242;talking to him.
130;00:09:56,276;00:09:58,411;Now they'll think
130;00:09:56,276;00:09:58,411;we're cowards too.
131;00:09:58,445;00:10:00,145;You're too stupid
131;00:09:58,445;00:10:00,145;to be a coward.
132;00:10:00,180;00:10:02,481;You're too stupid to be a--
132;00:10:00,180;00:10:02,481;Quick now,
133;00:10:02,515;00:10:05,184;before summer's over.
134;00:10:05,218;00:10:07,419;C'mere!
135;00:10:35,680;00:10:39,150;Hyah hyah!
136;00:10:41,854;00:10:45,624;Vaes Dothrak--
136;00:10:41,854;00:10:45,624;the city of the horselords.
137;00:10:47,761;00:10:49,395;A pile of mud.
138;00:10:49,429;00:10:50,897;Mud and shit
138;00:10:49,429;00:10:50,897;and twigs--
139;00:10:50,931;00:10:54,200;best these savages can do.
139;00:10:50,931;00:10:54,200;These are my people now.
140;00:10:54,234;00:10:56,302;You shouldn't
140;00:10:54,234;00:10:56,302;call them savages.
141;00:10:56,336;00:10:58,437;I'll call them what I like,
141;00:10:56,336;00:10:58,437;because they're my people.
142;00:10:58,472;00:11:00,806;This is my army.
143;00:11:00,840;00:11:04,242;Khal Drogo is marching the
143;00:11:00,840;00:11:04,242;wrong way with my army.
144;00:11:23,528;00:11:26,797;If my brother was given
144;00:11:23,528;00:11:26,797;an army of Dothraki,
145;00:11:26,831;00:11:30,567;could you conquer
145;00:11:26,831;00:11:30,567;the Seven Kingdoms?
146;00:11:30,601;00:11:33,303;The Dothraki have never
146;00:11:30,601;00:11:33,303;crossed the Narrow Sea.
147;00:11:33,337;00:11:35,973;They fear any water
147;00:11:33,337;00:11:35,973;their horses can't drink.
148;00:11:36,007;00:11:38,342;But if they did?
149;00:11:38,376;00:11:41,879;King Robert is fool enough
149;00:11:38,376;00:11:41,879;to meet them in open battle,
150;00:11:41,913;00:11:44,848;but the men
150;00:11:41,913;00:11:44,848;advising him are different.
151;00:11:44,883;00:11:49,085;And you know these men?
151;00:11:44,883;00:11:49,085;I fought beside them once,
152;00:11:49,120;00:11:51,254;long ago.
153;00:11:51,288;00:11:53,656;Now Ned Stark wants my head.
154;00:11:53,691;00:11:56,459;He drove me
154;00:11:53,691;00:11:56,459;from my land.
155;00:11:57,695;00:11:59,796;You sold slaves.
156;00:12:00,998;00:12:03,399;Aye.
157;00:12:04,268;00:12:07,270;Why?
157;00:12:04,268;00:12:07,270;I had no money
158;00:12:07,304;00:12:09,806;and an expensive wife.
159;00:12:09,840;00:12:11,675;And where is she now?
160;00:12:11,709;00:12:13,643;In another place,
161;00:12:13,678;00:12:16,113;with another man.
162;00:12:21,786;00:12:24,521;Your Grace?
162;00:12:21,786;00:12:24,521;Yes, my dear?
163;00:12:24,555;00:12:27,324;They call you
163;00:12:24,555;00:12:27,324;the Last Dragon...
164;00:12:27,358;00:12:30,060;They do.
165;00:12:31,329;00:12:33,498;You have dragon's blood
166;00:12:33,532;00:12:35,433;in your veins?
167;00:12:35,468;00:12:37,502;It's entirely possible.
168;00:12:37,537;00:12:41,106;What happened to the dragons?
169;00:12:41,140;00:12:43,809;I was told that brave men
169;00:12:41,140;00:12:43,809;killed them all.
170;00:12:47,547;00:12:50,182;The brave men
170;00:12:47,547;00:12:50,182;didn't kill dragons.
171;00:12:50,217;00:12:52,985;The brave men
171;00:12:50,217;00:12:52,985;rode them.
172;00:12:53,020;00:12:57,423;Rode them from Valyria
172;00:12:53,020;00:12:57,423;to build the greatest civilization
173;00:12:57,458;00:12:59,993;this world
173;00:12:57,458;00:12:59,993;has ever seen.
174;00:13:00,027;00:13:02,362;The breath
174;00:13:00,027;00:13:02,362;of the greatest dragon
175;00:13:02,396;00:13:04,398;forged the Iron Throne,
176;00:13:04,432;00:13:07,201;which the usurper is
176;00:13:04,432;00:13:07,201;keeping warm for me.
177;00:13:08,503;00:13:11,038;The swords
177;00:13:08,503;00:13:11,038;of the vanquished,
178;00:13:11,073;00:13:13,873;a thousand of them...
179;00:13:13,908;00:13:18,278;Melted together
179;00:13:13,908;00:13:18,278;like so many candles.
180;00:13:21,581;00:13:24,683;I have always wanted
180;00:13:21,581;00:13:24,683;to see a dragon.
181;00:13:26,319;00:13:29,220;There is nothing in the world
181;00:13:26,319;00:13:29,220;that I would rather see.
182;00:13:29,255;00:13:31,422;Really.
182;00:13:29,255;00:13:31,422;Why dragons?
183;00:13:31,456;00:13:34,158;They can fly.
184;00:13:34,193;00:13:37,296;And wherever they are,
184;00:13:34,193;00:13:37,296;just a few flaps of their wings
185;00:13:37,330;00:13:39,932;and they're
185;00:13:37,330;00:13:39,932;somewhere else...
186;00:13:39,967;00:13:42,101;Far away.
187;00:13:44,572;00:13:46,907;And they can kill.
188;00:13:46,941;00:13:51,512;Anyone or anything that
188;00:13:46,941;00:13:51,512;tries to hurt them
189;00:13:51,546;00:13:56,550;gets burned away to nothing...
190;00:13:56,584;00:14:00,153;...Like so many candles.
191;00:14:00,188;00:14:01,354;Ow.
192;00:14:03,957;00:14:06,292;Yes.
192;00:14:03,957;00:14:06,292;Seeing a dragon
193;00:14:06,326;00:14:08,260;would make me very happy.
194;00:14:08,294;00:14:10,863;Well, after 15 years
194;00:14:08,294;00:14:10,863;in a pleasure house,
195;00:14:10,897;00:14:13,098;I imagine just seeing
195;00:14:10,897;00:14:13,098;the sky makes you happy.
196;00:14:13,133;00:14:16,201;I was not locked in.
196;00:14:13,133;00:14:16,201;I have seen things.
197;00:14:16,236;00:14:18,204;What have you seen?
197;00:14:16,236;00:14:18,204;I've seen...
198;00:14:18,238;00:14:22,008;A man from Asshai with a dagger
198;00:14:18,238;00:14:22,008;of real dragonglass.
199;00:14:22,043;00:14:24,178;Ooh.
199;00:14:22,043;00:14:24,178;I've seen a man who could
200;00:14:24,212;00:14:28,617;change his face the way that
200;00:14:24,212;00:14:28,617;other men change their clothes.
201;00:14:28,651;00:14:32,655;And I've seen a pirate
201;00:14:28,651;00:14:32,655;who wore his weight in gold
202;00:14:32,689;00:14:36,825;and whose ship had
202;00:14:32,689;00:14:36,825;sails of colored silk.
203;00:14:36,859;00:14:41,297;So...
204;00:14:41,331;00:14:43,499;Have you seen one?
205;00:14:43,533;00:14:47,036;A pirate ship?
205;00:14:43,533;00:14:47,036;A dragon.
206;00:14:47,971;00:14:50,038;No.
207;00:14:50,073;00:14:53,543;No, the last one died many years
207;00:14:50,073;00:14:53,543;before I was born.
208;00:14:53,577;00:14:56,912;I'll tell you
208;00:14:53,577;00:14:56,912;what I have seen:
209;00:14:56,947;00:14:59,515;Their skulls.
210;00:14:59,550;00:15:02,686;They used to decorate
210;00:14:59,550;00:15:02,686;the throne room in the Red Keep.
211;00:15:02,720;00:15:05,122;When I was very young,
211;00:15:02,720;00:15:05,122;just three or four,
212;00:15:05,156;00:15:07,358;my father used
212;00:15:05,156;00:15:07,358;to walk me down the rows
213;00:15:07,392;00:15:09,126;and I'd recite
213;00:15:07,392;00:15:09,126;their names for him.
214;00:15:09,161;00:15:11,997;When I got them all right,
214;00:15:09,161;00:15:11,997;he'd give me a sweet.
215;00:15:13,666;00:15:16,801;The ones closest to the door were
215;00:15:13,666;00:15:16,801;the last ones they were able to hatch
216;00:15:16,835;00:15:18,636;and they were all
216;00:15:16,835;00:15:18,636;stunted and wrong.
217;00:15:18,670;00:15:21,940;Skulls no bigger
217;00:15:18,670;00:15:21,940;than dog skulls.
218;00:15:21,974;00:15:26,912;But as you got closer
218;00:15:21,974;00:15:26,912;to the Iron Throne...
219;00:15:28,248;00:15:30,282;They got bigger
220;00:15:30,317;00:15:33,385;and bigger and bigger.
221;00:15:36,189;00:15:38,690;There was Ghiscar
222;00:15:38,725;00:15:41,293;and Valryon,
223;00:15:41,327;00:15:43,094;Vermithrax,
224;00:15:43,129;00:15:45,463;Essovius--
225;00:15:45,498;00:15:47,999;Archonei,
226;00:15:48,033;00:15:51,002;Meraxes,
227;00:15:51,036;00:15:54,505;Vhagar...
228;00:15:56,109;00:15:58,911;And Balerion the dread...
229;00:15:58,945;00:16:01,513;...Whose fire forged
230;00:16:01,548;00:16:03,650;the Seven Kingdoms
231;00:16:03,684;00:16:05,919;into one.
232;00:16:10,392;00:16:13,127;What happened
232;00:16:10,392;00:16:13,127;to the skulls?
233;00:16:15,264;00:16:16,998;I don't know.
234;00:16:17,032;00:16:20,334;The usurper had them
234;00:16:17,032;00:16:20,334;smashed to powder, I expect.
235;00:16:21,203;00:16:23,438;Scattered to the wind.
236;00:16:26,441;00:16:29,176;That's very sad.
237;00:16:29,211;00:16:31,045;Yes, it is.
238;00:16:32,647;00:16:34,848;What did I buy you for?
239;00:16:34,882;00:16:37,951;To make me sad?
239;00:16:34,882;00:16:37,951;No, your Grace.
240;00:16:39,053;00:16:42,388;To, uh, teach your sister.
241;00:16:42,423;00:16:44,823;To teach my sister how
241;00:16:42,423;00:16:44,823;to be a better lover?
242;00:16:44,858;00:16:48,760;You think I bought you to make
242;00:16:44,858;00:16:48,760;Khal Drogo happy?
243;00:16:53,199;00:16:56,202;Oh, you pretty
243;00:16:53,199;00:16:56,202;little idiot.
244;00:16:58,238;00:17:00,373;Go on then.
244;00:16:58,238;00:17:00,373;Get on with it.
245;00:17:10,250;00:17:12,885;Someday your husband
245;00:17:10,250;00:17:12,885;will sit there
246;00:17:12,919;00:17:15,187;and you will sit
246;00:17:12,919;00:17:15,187;by his side.
247;00:17:15,222;00:17:20,360;And one day, before too long,
247;00:17:15,222;00:17:20,360;you will present your son to the court.
248;00:17:20,394;00:17:22,962;All the Lords of Westeros
249;00:17:22,997;00:17:25,732;will gather here to see
249;00:17:22,997;00:17:25,732;the little prince--
250;00:17:25,766;00:17:27,567;what if I have a girl?
251;00:17:27,602;00:17:30,537;Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls
251;00:17:27,602;00:17:30,537;and plenty of them.
252;00:17:30,571;00:17:33,172;What if I only
252;00:17:30,571;00:17:33,172;have girls?
253;00:17:33,207;00:17:35,342;I wouldn't worry
253;00:17:33,207;00:17:35,342;about that.
254;00:17:35,376;00:17:38,444;Jeyne Poole's mother had five children--
254;00:17:35,376;00:17:38,444;all of them girls.
255;00:17:38,478;00:17:40,580;Yes, but it's
255;00:17:38,478;00:17:40,580;highly unlikely.
256;00:17:40,614;00:17:43,116;But what if?
257;00:17:43,150;00:17:46,352;Well, if you only
257;00:17:43,150;00:17:46,352;had girls,
258;00:17:46,387;00:17:49,956;I suppose the throne would
258;00:17:46,387;00:17:49,956;pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.
259;00:17:49,990;00:17:52,926;And everyone
259;00:17:49,990;00:17:52,926;would hate me.
260;00:17:52,960;00:17:55,061;Nobody could ever
260;00:17:52,960;00:17:55,061;hate you.
261;00:17:55,096;00:17:57,598;Joffrey does.
261;00:17:55,096;00:17:57,598;Nonsense.
262;00:17:57,632;00:18:00,667;Why would you say
262;00:17:57,632;00:18:00,667;such a thing?
263;00:18:02,136;00:18:04,271;That business with the wolves?
263;00:18:02,136;00:18:04,271;Sansa,
264;00:18:04,305;00:18:06,707;I've told you
264;00:18:04,305;00:18:06,707;a hundred times:
265;00:18:06,741;00:18:09,476;A direwolf is not--
265;00:18:06,741;00:18:09,476;please shut up about it.
266;00:18:10,878;00:18:12,679;Do you remember
266;00:18:10,878;00:18:12,679;your lessons?
267;00:18:14,482;00:18:17,251;Who built the Iron Throne?
268;00:18:17,285;00:18:19,353;Aegon the Conqueror.
269;00:18:19,387;00:18:21,422;And who built
269;00:18:19,387;00:18:21,422;the Red Keep?
270;00:18:21,456;00:18:23,023;Maegor the Cruel.
271;00:18:23,058;00:18:24,925;And how many years
271;00:18:23,058;00:18:24,925;did it take to build--
272;00:18:24,959;00:18:27,995;my grandfather and Uncle
272;00:18:24,959;00:18:27,995;were murdered here, weren't they?
273;00:18:29,497;00:18:32,732;They were killed on the orders of
273;00:18:29,497;00:18:32,732;King Aerys, yes.
274;00:18:32,767;00:18:37,070;The Mad King.
274;00:18:32,767;00:18:37,070;Commonly known as the Mad King.
275;00:18:37,104;00:18:39,538;Why were they killed?
276;00:18:40,940;00:18:43,808;You should be speak to your
276;00:18:40,940;00:18:43,808;father about these matters.
277;00:18:43,843;00:18:45,843;I don't want to speak
277;00:18:43,843;00:18:45,843;to my father-- ever.
278;00:18:45,878;00:18:49,347;Sansa, you will
278;00:18:45,878;00:18:49,347;find it in your heart
279;00:18:49,381;00:18:50,882;to forgive your father.
280;00:18:50,916;00:18:52,683;No, I won't.
281;00:18:52,717;00:18:54,985;It's The Hand's
281;00:18:52,717;00:18:54,985;tournament that's causing
282;00:18:55,020;00:18:57,688;all this trouble, My Lords.
282;00:18:55,020;00:18:57,688;The King's tournament.
283;00:18:57,723;00:19:01,358;I assure you The Hand
283;00:18:57,723;00:19:01,358;wants no part of it.
284;00:19:01,393;00:19:03,627;Call it what you will,
284;00:19:01,393;00:19:03,627;Lord Stark, Ser,
285;00:19:03,662;00:19:06,930;the city is packed with people
285;00:19:03,662;00:19:06,930;and more flooding in every day.
286;00:19:06,965;00:19:10,133;Last night we had a tavern riot,
286;00:19:06,965;00:19:10,133;a brothel fire,
287;00:19:10,167;00:19:13,070;three stabbings and a drunken horse race
287;00:19:10,167;00:19:13,070;down the Street of Sisters.
288;00:19:13,104;00:19:15,939;Dreadful.
288;00:19:13,104;00:19:15,939;If you can't keep the King's peace,
289;00:19:15,974;00:19:19,009;perhaps the city watch should be
289;00:19:15,974;00:19:19,009;commanded by someone who can.
290;00:19:19,044;00:19:20,744;I need more men.
290;00:19:19,044;00:19:20,744;Ned: You'll get 50.
291;00:19:20,778;00:19:23,714;Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
291;00:19:20,778;00:19:23,714;I will?
292;00:19:23,748;00:19:25,449;You found money
292;00:19:23,748;00:19:25,449;for a champion's purse,
293;00:19:25,483;00:19:27,384;you can find money
293;00:19:25,483;00:19:27,384;to keep the peace.
294;00:19:29,187;00:19:31,255;I'll also give you
294;00:19:29,187;00:19:31,255;20 of my household guard
295;00:19:31,289;00:19:33,089;till the crowds
295;00:19:31,289;00:19:33,089;have left.
296;00:19:33,123;00:19:34,758;Thank you,
296;00:19:33,123;00:19:34,758;My Lord Hand, Ser.
297;00:19:34,792;00:19:36,526;They will be put
297;00:19:34,792;00:19:36,526;to good use.
298;00:19:38,762;00:19:40,797;The sooner this is over,
298;00:19:38,762;00:19:40,797;the better.
299;00:19:40,831;00:19:43,800;The realm prospers
299;00:19:40,831;00:19:43,800;from such events, My Lord.
300;00:19:43,834;00:19:46,002;They give the great
300;00:19:43,834;00:19:46,002;a chance at glory,
301;00:19:46,036;00:19:48,304;and the lowly a respite
301;00:19:46,036;00:19:48,304;from their woes.
302;00:19:48,339;00:19:50,774;And every inn in
302;00:19:48,339;00:19:50,774;the city is full
303;00:19:50,808;00:19:52,842;and the whores
303;00:19:50,808;00:19:52,842;are walking bow-legged.
304;00:19:52,877;00:19:55,345;I'm sure the tourney
304;00:19:52,877;00:19:55,345;puts coins in many a pocket.
305;00:19:55,379;00:19:57,914;Hmmm.
305;00:19:55,379;00:19:57,914;Now...
306;00:19:57,949;00:20:00,517;If there's nothing else,
306;00:19:57,949;00:20:00,517;My Lords?
307;00:20:10,061;00:20:12,562;Oh, this heat.
308;00:20:12,597;00:20:15,398;On days like this,
308;00:20:12,597;00:20:15,398;I envy you Northerners
309;00:20:15,433;00:20:17,167;your summer snows.
310;00:20:17,208;00:20:18,215;Until tomorrow, My Lord--
311;00:20:18,240;00:20:20,612;I've been hoping to talk
311;00:20:18,240;00:20:20,612;to you about Jon Arryn.
312;00:20:20,805;00:20:23,673;Lord Arryn?
313;00:20:23,707;00:20:25,875;Oh, his death was
314;00:20:25,910;00:20:28,644;a great sadness
314;00:20:25,910;00:20:28,644;to all of us.
315;00:20:28,679;00:20:30,913;I took personal charge
315;00:20:28,679;00:20:30,913;of his care,
316;00:20:30,947;00:20:33,616;but I could not
316;00:20:30,947;00:20:33,616;save him.
317;00:20:33,650;00:20:35,919;His sickness struck him
318;00:20:35,953;00:20:39,389;very hard and very fast.
319;00:20:40,291;00:20:41,959;I saw him in my chambers
320;00:20:41,993;00:20:43,928;just the night
320;00:20:41,993;00:20:43,928;before he passed.
321;00:20:43,962;00:20:47,131;Lord Jon often came
321;00:20:43,962;00:20:47,131;to me for counsel.
322;00:20:47,166;00:20:49,902;Why?
323;00:20:49,936;00:20:53,505;I have been Grand Maester
323;00:20:49,936;00:20:53,505;for many years.
324;00:20:53,539;00:20:56,975;Kings and Hands have come to me
324;00:20:53,539;00:20:56,975;for advice since--
325;00:20:57,010;00:20:59,912;What did Jon want
325;00:20:57,010;00:20:59,912;the night before he died?
326;00:20:59,946;00:21:02,381;Oh, he came inquiring
326;00:20:59,946;00:21:02,381;after a book.
327;00:21:02,415;00:21:04,150;A book?
328;00:21:04,184;00:21:05,818;What book?
329;00:21:05,852;00:21:07,553;Oh, I fear
330;00:21:07,588;00:21:10,357;it would be of little interest
330;00:21:07,588;00:21:10,357;to you, My Lord.
331;00:21:10,391;00:21:12,859;A ponderous Tome.
332;00:21:12,894;00:21:16,463;No, I'd like to read it.
333;00:21:19,000;00:21:21,469;The Lineages and Histories
334;00:21:21,503;00:21:24,673;of the Great H
334;00:21:21,503;00:21:24,673;of the Seven Kingdoms,
335;00:21:24,707;00:21:28,377;with descriptions
335;00:21:24,707;00:21:28,377;of many high lords
336;00:21:28,411;00:21:31,514;and noble ladies
337;00:21:31,548;00:21:33,682;and their children.
338;00:21:50,864;00:21:53,266;Harkon Umber,
338;00:21:50,864;00:21:53,266;first of his name,
339;00:21:53,300;00:21:57,103;born to Lord Hother Umber
339;00:21:53,300;00:21:57,103;and Lady Amaryllis Umber
340;00:21:57,137;00:21:59,672;in the 183rd year
340;00:21:57,137;00:21:59,672;after Aegon's landing,
341;00:21:59,707;00:22:03,010;at the last hearth.
341;00:21:59,707;00:22:03,010;Blue of eye, brown of hair
342;00:22:03,044;00:22:06,547;and fair complected,
342;00:22:03,044;00:22:06,547;died in his 14th year
343;00:22:06,582;00:22:08,817;of a wound sustained
343;00:22:06,582;00:22:08,817;in a bear hunt.
344;00:22:08,851;00:22:12,621;As I said, My Lord,
344;00:22:08,851;00:22:12,621;a ponderous read.
345;00:22:12,655;00:22:15,490;Did Jon Arryn tell you
345;00:22:12,655;00:22:15,490;what he wanted with it?
346;00:22:15,524;00:22:18,293;He did not, My Lord.
346;00:22:15,524;00:22:18,293;And I did not presume to ask.
347;00:22:18,327;00:22:20,961;Jon's death...
347;00:22:18,327;00:22:20,961;Such a tragedy.
348;00:22:20,996;00:22:23,330;...Did he say anything to you
348;00:22:20,996;00:22:23,330;during his final hours?
349;00:22:23,365;00:22:25,165;Nothing of import,
349;00:22:23,365;00:22:25,165;My Lord.
350;00:22:25,199;00:22:28,001;Oh-- there was one phrase
351;00:22:28,035;00:22:29,869;he kept repeating:
352;00:22:29,903;00:22:33,372;The seed is strong,
352;00:22:29,903;00:22:33,372;I think it was.
353;00:22:33,407;00:22:35,709;The seed is strong?
353;00:22:33,407;00:22:35,709;Mm.
354;00:22:35,743;00:22:37,978;What does that mean?
354;00:22:35,743;00:22:37,978;Oh,
355;00:22:38,013;00:22:41,115;the dying mind is
355;00:22:38,013;00:22:41,115;a demented mind, Lord Stark.
356;00:22:41,150;00:22:43,651;For all the weight
356;00:22:41,150;00:22:43,651;they're given,
357;00:22:43,686;00:22:45,754;last words are usually
358;00:22:45,788;00:22:47,857;as significant
358;00:22:45,788;00:22:47,857;as first words.
359;00:22:47,891;00:22:50,826;And you're quite certain
359;00:22:47,891;00:22:50,826;he died of a natural illness?
360;00:22:50,861;00:22:53,162;What else could it be?
361;00:22:54,064;00:22:55,698;Poison.
362;00:22:55,732;00:22:58,401;A disturbing thought.
363;00:22:58,435;00:23:00,603;No no no, I don't
363;00:22:58,435;00:23:00,603;think it likely.
364;00:23:00,637;00:23:03,038;The Hand
364;00:23:00,637;00:23:03,038;was loved by all.
365;00:23:03,073;00:23:05,074;What sort of man
365;00:23:03,073;00:23:05,074;would dare--
366;00:23:05,108;00:23:07,977;I've heard it said that poison
366;00:23:05,108;00:23:07,977;is a woman's weapon.
367;00:23:08,011;00:23:10,479;Yes, women,
368;00:23:10,514;00:23:12,414;cravens...
369;00:23:12,448;00:23:15,116;And eunuchs.
370;00:23:15,151;00:23:18,554;Did you know that
370;00:23:15,151;00:23:18,554;Lord Varys is a eunuch?
371;00:23:18,588;00:23:20,055;Everybody knows that.
372;00:23:20,089;00:23:22,324;Yes yes, of course.
373;00:23:22,358;00:23:25,794;How that sort of person
373;00:23:22,358;00:23:25,794;found himself
374;00:23:25,829;00:23:28,463;on the King's Council,
374;00:23:25,829;00:23:28,463;I will never know.
375;00:23:28,498;00:23:30,198;I've taken enough
375;00:23:28,498;00:23:30,198;of your time.
376;00:23:30,233;00:23:32,835;No trouble at all, My Lord.
376;00:23:30,233;00:23:32,835;It's a great honor--
377;00:23:32,869;00:23:34,603;thank you.
378;00:23:34,638;00:23:36,572;I'll find my own way out.
379;00:23:59,098;00:24:01,133;Syrio says a water dancer
380;00:24:01,167;00:24:02,867;can stand on one toe
380;00:24:01,167;00:24:02,867;for hours.
381;00:24:02,902;00:24:05,704;It's a hard fall
381;00:24:02,902;00:24:05,704;down these steps.
382;00:24:05,738;00:24:07,706;Syrio says every hurt
382;00:24:05,738;00:24:07,706;is a lesson
383;00:24:07,741;00:24:09,942;and every lesson
383;00:24:07,741;00:24:09,942;makes you better.
384;00:24:11,478;00:24:14,480;Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
384;00:24:11,478;00:24:14,480;Cats?
385;00:24:14,515;00:24:16,015;Syrio says.
386;00:24:16,049;00:24:18,117;He says every swordsman
386;00:24:16,049;00:24:18,117;should study cats.
387;00:24:18,152;00:24:21,188;They're quiet as shadows
387;00:24:18,152;00:24:21,188;and as light as feathers.
388;00:24:21,222;00:24:23,490;You have to be
388;00:24:21,222;00:24:23,490;quick to catch them.
389;00:24:23,525;00:24:25,360;He's right about that.
390;00:24:25,394;00:24:26,828;Now that Bran's awake
391;00:24:26,862;00:24:29,665;will he come
391;00:24:26,862;00:24:29,665;live with us?
392;00:24:31,434;00:24:34,637;Well, he needs to get
392;00:24:31,434;00:24:34,637;his strength back first.
393;00:24:34,671;00:24:37,139;He wants to be
393;00:24:34,671;00:24:37,139;a knight of the Kingsguard.
394;00:24:37,173;00:24:41,544;He can't be one now, can he?
394;00:24:37,173;00:24:41,544;No.
395;00:24:43,380;00:24:45,514;But someday
396;00:24:45,549;00:24:47,850;he could be
396;00:24:45,549;00:24:47,850;Lord of a Holdfast
397;00:24:47,884;00:24:50,118;or sit on
397;00:24:47,884;00:24:50,118;the King's Council.
398;00:24:50,153;00:24:52,555;Or he might raise castles
399;00:24:52,589;00:24:55,123;like Brandon the builder.
400;00:24:55,158;00:24:57,893;Can I be Lord
400;00:24:55,158;00:24:57,893;of a Holdfast?
401;00:25:02,264;00:25:05,266;You will marry
401;00:25:02,264;00:25:05,266;a high lord
402;00:25:05,300;00:25:07,301;and rule his castle.
403;00:25:07,335;00:25:09,702;And your sons
403;00:25:07,335;00:25:09,702;shall be knights
404;00:25:09,737;00:25:12,338;and princes and lords.
405;00:25:13,741;00:25:16,409;Hmm?
405;00:25:13,741;00:25:16,409;No.
406;00:25:17,344;00:25:19,812;That's not me.
407;00:25:41,937;00:25:44,071;Hello.
408;00:25:45,574;00:25:48,175;Ser Alliser said I'm to be
408;00:25:45,574;00:25:48,175;your new Watch partner.
409;00:25:50,345;00:25:51,879;I should warn you,
410;00:25:51,913;00:25:54,782;I don't see
410;00:25:51,913;00:25:54,782;all that well.
411;00:25:55,950;00:25:57,952;Come stand by the fire.
412;00:25:59,321;00:26:01,556;It's warmer.
412;00:25:59,321;00:26:01,556;No, that's all right. I'm fine.
413;00:26:01,590;00:26:03,958;You're not.
413;00:26:01,590;00:26:03,958;You're freezing.
414;00:26:15,804;00:26:18,740;I don't like
414;00:26:15,804;00:26:18,740;high places.
415;00:26:18,775;00:26:20,509;You can't fight.
416;00:26:20,543;00:26:22,311;You can't see.
417;00:26:22,346;00:26:25,682;You're afraid of heights
417;00:26:22,346;00:26:25,682;and almost everything else probably.
418;00:26:27,385;00:26:29,319;What are you
418;00:26:27,385;00:26:29,319;doing here, Sam?
419;00:26:33,692;00:26:37,394;On the morning of my 18th Nameday,
419;00:26:33,692;00:26:37,394;my father came to me.
420;00:26:38,630;00:26:40,998;You're almost
420;00:26:38,630;00:26:40,998;a man now, he said...
421;00:26:42,334;00:26:45,569;But you're not worthy
421;00:26:42,334;00:26:45,569;of my land and title.
422;00:26:46,838;00:26:49,140;Tomorrow, you're going
422;00:26:46,838;00:26:49,140;to take the black,
423;00:26:49,174;00:26:52,476;forsake all claim to your
423;00:26:49,174;00:26:52,476;inheritance and start North.
424;00:26:52,510;00:26:56,914;If you do not,
424;00:26:52,510;00:26:56,914;he said...
425;00:26:57,882;00:27:00,083;Then we'll have a hunt
426;00:27:00,118;00:27:03,153;and somewhere in these woods
426;00:27:00,118;00:27:03,153;your horse will stumble
427;00:27:03,187;00:27:06,023;and you'll be thrown
427;00:27:03,187;00:27:06,023;from your saddle to die.
428;00:27:08,526;00:27:11,061;Or so I'll tell
428;00:27:08,526;00:27:11,061;your mother.
429;00:27:11,096;00:27:13,263;Nothing would
429;00:27:11,096;00:27:13,263;please me more.
430;00:27:18,436;00:27:21,538;Ser Alliser's going to make me
430;00:27:18,436;00:27:21,538;fight again tomorrow, isn't he?
431;00:27:22,707;00:27:24,842;Yes, he is.
432;00:27:24,876;00:27:27,645;I'm not going to get
432;00:27:24,876;00:27:27,645;any better, you know?
433;00:27:29,081;00:27:30,982;Well...
434;00:27:31,016;00:27:32,817;You can't get any worse.
435;00:27:42,593;00:27:45,394;I hear you're reading
435;00:27:42,593;00:27:45,394;a boring book.
436;00:27:45,429;00:27:47,229;Hmph.
437;00:27:47,264;00:27:49,398;Pycelle talks too much.
438;00:27:49,432;00:27:51,333;Oh, he never stops.
439;00:27:51,367;00:27:53,868;Do you know Ser Hugh
439;00:27:51,367;00:27:53,868;of the Vale?
440;00:27:55,004;00:27:57,405;Not surprising.
440;00:27:55,004;00:27:57,405;Until recently,
441;00:27:57,440;00:28:00,975;he was only a squire--
441;00:27:57,440;00:28:00,975;Jon Arryn's squire.
442;00:28:01,010;00:28:02,977;He was knighted
442;00:28:01,010;00:28:02,977;almost immediately
443;00:28:03,012;00:28:05,413;after his master's
443;00:28:03,012;00:28:05,413;untimely death.
444;00:28:05,447;00:28:07,749;Knighted for what?
445;00:28:08,717;00:28:10,351;Why are you
445;00:28:08,717;00:28:10,351;telling me this?
446;00:28:10,385;00:28:12,086;I promised cat
446;00:28:10,385;00:28:12,086;that I'd help you.
447;00:28:12,120;00:28:14,588;Where is Ser Hugh?
448;00:28:14,623;00:28:17,524;I'll speak to him.
448;00:28:14,623;00:28:17,524;A singularly bad idea.
449;00:28:17,559;00:28:19,726;Do you see
449;00:28:17,559;00:28:19,726;that boy there?
450;00:28:19,761;00:28:22,395;One of Varys's little birds.
451;00:28:22,430;00:28:26,232;The spider has taken a great
451;00:28:22,430;00:28:26,232;interest in your comings and goings.
452;00:28:26,266;00:28:28,167;Now look there.
453;00:28:28,202;00:28:30,936;That one belongs
453;00:28:28,202;00:28:30,936;to the Queen.
454;00:28:30,971;00:28:34,106;And do you see that septa
454;00:28:30,971;00:28:34,106;pretending to read her book?
455;00:28:34,140;00:28:37,008;Varys or the Queen?
456;00:28:37,042;00:28:39,744;No, she's one
456;00:28:37,042;00:28:39,744;of mine.
457;00:28:41,446;00:28:44,681;Is there someone in your service
457;00:28:41,446;00:28:44,681;whom you trust completely?
458;00:28:46,750;00:28:50,186;Yes.
458;00:28:46,750;00:28:50,186;The wiser answer was no, My Lord.
459;00:28:51,321;00:28:54,224;Get a message to
459;00:28:51,321;00:28:54,224;this paragon of yours--
460;00:28:54,258;00:28:57,427;discreetly--
460;00:28:54,258;00:28:57,427;send him to question Ser Hugh.
461;00:28:57,461;00:29:01,699;After that, you might want him
461;00:28:57,461;00:29:01,699;to visit a certain armorer in the city.
462;00:29:01,733;00:29:05,336;He lives in a large house at the top
462;00:29:01,733;00:29:05,336;of the Street of Steel.
463;00:29:05,370;00:29:07,772;Why?
463;00:29:05,370;00:29:07,772;I have my observers, as I said,
464;00:29:07,807;00:29:10,308;and it's possible
464;00:29:07,807;00:29:10,308;that they saw Lord Arryn
465;00:29:10,343;00:29:14,246;visit this armorer several times
465;00:29:10,343;00:29:14,246;in the weeks before his death.
466;00:29:15,848;00:29:18,883;Lord Baelish, perhaps I was
466;00:29:15,848;00:29:18,883;wrong to distrust you.
467;00:29:18,918;00:29:20,785;Distrusting me was
467;00:29:18,918;00:29:20,785;the wisest thing
468;00:29:20,820;00:29:23,421;you've done since you climbed
468;00:29:20,820;00:29:23,421;off your horse.
469;00:29:29,894;00:29:33,029;...Two, three,
470;00:29:33,063;00:29:34,864;24, five,
471;00:29:34,899;00:29:37,200;six, 27,
472;00:29:37,234;00:29:39,235;28, 29--
472;00:29:37,234;00:29:39,235;Ser Hugh?
473;00:29:39,270;00:29:40,938;30, 31, 32
474;00:29:40,972;00:29:43,240;Ser Hugh!
474;00:29:40,972;00:29:43,240;As you can see, I'm busy.
475;00:29:43,274;00:29:46,210;I'm here on behalf
475;00:29:43,274;00:29:46,210;of Lord Eddard Stark,
476;00:29:46,245;00:29:48,513;the Hand of the King.
477;00:29:48,547;00:29:49,947;I'm the Captain
477;00:29:48,547;00:29:49,947;of his guard.
478;00:29:49,982;00:29:52,150;I'm sorry, I didn't catch
478;00:29:49,982;00:29:52,150;your name, Ser...
479;00:29:52,184;00:29:54,853;No Ser.
479;00:29:52,184;00:29:54,853;I'm not a knight.
480;00:29:54,887;00:29:58,189;I see. Well, it just
480;00:29:54,887;00:29:58,189;so happens that I am.
481;00:30:02,927;00:30:05,896;He said he'd be glad
481;00:30:02,927;00:30:05,896;to talk to the hand himself.
482;00:30:05,930;00:30:07,764;He's a knight,
482;00:30:05,930;00:30:07,764;you see.
483;00:30:07,798;00:30:09,532;Ah, a knight.
484;00:30:09,566;00:30:12,434;They strut around
484;00:30:09,566;00:30:12,434;like roosters down here.
485;00:30:12,469;00:30:16,138;Even the ones who've never seen
485;00:30:12,469;00:30:16,138;an arrow coming their way.
486;00:30:16,172;00:30:18,040;You shouldn't be
486;00:30:16,172;00:30:18,040;out here, My Lord.
487;00:30:18,074;00:30:21,510;There's no telling who has eyes where.
487;00:30:18,074;00:30:21,510;Let them look.
488;00:30:23,513;00:30:26,348;The former Hand did call on me,
488;00:30:23,513;00:30:26,348;My Lord, several times.
489;00:30:26,383;00:30:29,718;I regret to say he did not honor me
489;00:30:26,383;00:30:29,718;with his patronage.
490;00:30:29,753;00:30:32,287;What did
490;00:30:29,753;00:30:32,287;Lord Arryn want?
491;00:30:32,322;00:30:34,389;He always came to see the boy.
492;00:30:34,424;00:30:36,325;I'd like to see him
492;00:30:34,424;00:30:36,325;as well.
493;00:30:38,260;00:30:40,695;As you Gendry! My lord.
494;00:30:44,499;00:30:46,066;Here he is.
495;00:30:46,100;00:30:48,735;Strong for his age.
495;00:30:46,100;00:30:48,735;He works hard.
496;00:30:48,769;00:30:51,905;Show the hand
496;00:30:48,769;00:30:51,905;the helmet you made, lad.
497;00:31:05,754;00:31:08,523;This is fine work.
497;00:31:05,754;00:31:08,523;It's not for sale.
498;00:31:08,557;00:31:10,458;Boy, this is
498;00:31:08,557;00:31:10,458;the King's Hand!
499;00:31:10,493;00:31:13,896;If his lordship wants the helm--
499;00:31:10,493;00:31:13,896;I made it for me.
500;00:31:13,930;00:31:16,565;Forgive him, My Lord.
500;00:31:13,930;00:31:16,565;There's nothing to forgive.
501;00:31:18,067;00:31:20,802;When Lord Arryn came to visit you,
501;00:31:18,067;00:31:20,802;what would you talk about?
502;00:31:20,836;00:31:23,338;He just asked me questions
502;00:31:20,836;00:31:23,338;is all, My Lord.
503;00:31:23,372;00:31:25,540;What kind
503;00:31:23,372;00:31:25,540;of questions?
504;00:31:27,643;00:31:29,944;About my work at first,
505;00:31:29,978;00:31:33,581;if I was being treated well,
505;00:31:29,978;00:31:33,581;if I liked it here.
506;00:31:35,317;00:31:37,552;But then he started
506;00:31:35,317;00:31:37,552;asking me about my mother.
507;00:31:38,921;00:31:41,989;Your mother?
507;00:31:38,921;00:31:41,989;Who she was, what she looked like.
508;00:31:42,925;00:31:44,759;What did you tell him?
509;00:31:46,462;00:31:48,530;She died when I was little.
510;00:31:48,564;00:31:50,798;She had yellow hair.
511;00:31:50,833;00:31:53,468;She'd sing to me sometimes.
512;00:31:57,373;00:31:59,241;Look at me.
513;00:32:08,952;00:32:10,887;Get back to work, lad.
514;00:32:12,623;00:32:14,624;If the day ever comes
514;00:32:12,623;00:32:14,624;when that boy
515;00:32:14,658;00:32:16,826;would rather wield
515;00:32:14,658;00:32:16,826;a sword than forge one,
516;00:32:16,860;00:32:19,261;you send him to me.
517;00:32:24,034;00:32:26,068;Find anything?
518;00:32:27,104;00:32:29,905;King Robert's
518;00:32:27,104;00:32:29,905;bastard son.
519;00:32:32,275;00:32:34,977;He likes that.
520;00:32:36,480;00:32:39,316;This is for the King
520;00:32:36,480;00:32:39,316;from Lord Stark.
521;00:32:39,350;00:32:41,585;Should I leave it with--
522;00:32:41,620;00:32:43,354;shhh.
523;00:32:43,388;00:32:45,223;Listen.
524;00:32:45,257;00:32:47,993;Do you hear them?
525;00:32:50,297;00:32:52,531;How many do you think
525;00:32:50,297;00:32:52,531;are in there with him?
526;00:32:52,565;00:32:54,366;Huh?
527;00:32:54,400;00:32:56,201;Guess.
527;00:32:54,400;00:32:56,201;Three?
528;00:32:56,235;00:32:58,536;Four.
529;00:33:00,238;00:33:02,507;He likes to do this
529;00:33:00,238;00:33:02,507;when I'm on duty--
530;00:33:02,541;00:33:05,109;he makes me listen
530;00:33:02,541;00:33:05,109;as he insults my sister.
531;00:33:10,816;00:33:11,639;Forgive me, My Lord--
532;00:33:11,664;00:33:13,665;Why do I have to forgive you?
532;00:33:11,664;00:33:13,665;Have you wronged me?
533;00:33:16,187;00:33:17,988;We've met before, you know.
534;00:33:18,023;00:33:20,992;Have we?
534;00:33:18,023;00:33:20,992;Strange, I've forgotten.
535;00:33:21,026;00:33:24,463;The siege of Pyke.
535;00:33:21,026;00:33:24,463;We fought side by side one afternoon.
536;00:33:24,497;00:33:26,298;Ah.
537;00:33:26,332;00:33:28,367;That's where you got your scar?
537;00:33:26,332;00:33:28,367;Aye.
538;00:33:28,401;00:33:29,802;Oh.
539;00:33:29,837;00:33:31,671;One of the Greyjoys
539;00:33:29,837;00:33:31,671;nearly took my eye.
540;00:33:31,706;00:33:34,675;Vicious sons of whores.
540;00:33:31,706;00:33:34,675;They like their bloodshed.
541;00:33:34,709;00:33:36,877;They stopped liking it
541;00:33:34,709;00:33:36,877;at the end.
542;00:33:36,911;00:33:40,914;That was a proper battle.
542;00:33:36,911;00:33:40,914;Do you remember
543;00:33:40,949;00:33:43,984;Thoros of Myr charging
543;00:33:40,949;00:33:43,984;through the breach?
544;00:33:44,019;00:33:45,552;With his burning sword?
545;00:33:45,587;00:33:47,455;I'll remember that
545;00:33:45,587;00:33:47,455;till the day I die.
546;00:33:47,489;00:33:51,326;I saw the youngest of the
546;00:33:47,489;00:33:51,326;Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.
547;00:33:51,360;00:33:53,728;It was like seeing a shark
547;00:33:51,360;00:33:53,728;on a mountaintop.
548;00:33:53,762;00:33:56,030;Theon?
548;00:33:53,762;00:33:56,030;He's a good lad.
549;00:33:56,065;00:33:57,165;I doubt it.
550;00:34:02,005;00:34:04,540;I'll bet you smell
550;00:34:02,005;00:34:04,540;of blackberry jam!
551;00:34:04,575;00:34:06,943;Let me smell it.
551;00:34:04,575;00:34:06,943;Come here.
552;00:34:09,080;00:34:10,480;Can I leave this
552;00:34:09,080;00:34:10,480;with you?
553;00:34:10,515;00:34:12,149;The message
553;00:34:10,515;00:34:12,149;from Lord Stark.
554;00:34:12,183;00:34:14,518;I don't serve Lord Stark.
555;00:34:37,539;00:34:40,075;Where have you been?
555;00:34:37,539;00:34:40,075;Watch duty.
556;00:34:40,109;00:34:42,477;With Sam.
556;00:34:40,109;00:34:42,477;Ah, prince porkchop.
557;00:34:42,512;00:34:44,646;Where is he?
557;00:34:42,512;00:34:44,646;He wasn't hungry.
558;00:34:44,681;00:34:46,348;Impossible!
559;00:34:46,382;00:34:48,918;That's enough.
560;00:34:54,125;00:34:56,526;Sam's no different
560;00:34:54,125;00:34:56,526;from the rest of us.
561;00:34:56,560;00:34:58,862;There was no place
561;00:34:56,560;00:34:58,862;for him in the world,
562;00:34:58,896;00:35:00,696;so he's come here.
563;00:35:00,731;00:35:03,166;We're not going to hurt him
563;00:35:00,731;00:35:03,166;in the training yard anymore.
564;00:35:03,200;00:35:06,068;Never again,
564;00:35:03,200;00:35:06,068;no matter what Thorne says.
565;00:35:06,102;00:35:09,071;He's our brother now
565;00:35:06,102;00:35:09,071;and we're going to protect him.
566;00:35:09,105;00:35:11,773;You are in love, Lord Snow.
567;00:35:14,243;00:35:17,212;You girls can do
567;00:35:14,243;00:35:17,212;as you please.
568;00:35:17,246;00:35:20,082;But if Thorne puts me
568;00:35:17,246;00:35:20,082;up against lady piggy,
569;00:35:20,117;00:35:22,184;I'm gonna slice me off
569;00:35:20,117;00:35:22,184;a side of bacon.
570;00:35:45,244;00:35:47,946;No one touches Sam.
571;00:36:02,228;00:36:04,563;What are you
571;00:36:02,228;00:36:04,563;waiting for?
572;00:36:14,474;00:36:16,875;Attack him!
573;00:36:25,785;00:36:28,086;You get in there.
574;00:36:32,058;00:36:33,558;Hit me.
575;00:36:35,761;00:36:37,762;Go on, hit me!
576;00:36:39,698;00:36:42,300;I yield!
577;00:36:42,334;00:36:44,302;Yield yield.
578;00:36:44,336;00:36:46,570;I yield.
579;00:36:49,441;00:36:52,443;You think this
579;00:36:49,441;00:36:52,443;is funny, do you?
580;00:36:55,548;00:36:57,048;When you're out there
581;00:36:57,083;00:36:59,784;beyond The Wall
581;00:36:57,083;00:36:59,784;with the sun going down,
582;00:36:59,819;00:37:02,254;do you want
582;00:36:59,819;00:37:02,254;a man at your back?
583;00:37:02,288;00:37:04,590;Or a sniveling boy?
584;00:37:19,039;00:37:21,807;You send this whore
584;00:37:19,039;00:37:21,807;to give me commands?
585;00:37:21,842;00:37:24,376;I should have sent
585;00:37:21,842;00:37:24,376;you back her head!
586;00:37:24,410;00:37:26,311;Forgive me, Khaleesi.
586;00:37:24,410;00:37:26,311;I did as you asked.
587;00:37:26,346;00:37:27,946;Hush now.
587;00:37:26,346;00:37:27,946;It's all right.
588;00:37:27,981;00:37:31,283;Irri, take her and leave us.
588;00:37:27,981;00:37:31,283;Yes, Khaleesi.
589;00:37:34,621;00:37:37,689;Why did you hit her?!
589;00:37:34,621;00:37:37,689;How many times do I have to tell you?
590;00:37:37,724;00:37:39,324;You do not command me.
591;00:37:39,359;00:37:41,125;I wasn't commanding you.
592;00:37:41,160;00:37:42,960;I just wanted to invite
592;00:37:41,160;00:37:42,960;you to supper.
593;00:37:42,995;00:37:45,263;What's this?
593;00:37:42,995;00:37:45,263;It's a gift.
594;00:37:45,297;00:37:48,233;I had it made for you.
594;00:37:45,297;00:37:48,233;Dothraki rags?
595;00:37:48,267;00:37:50,301;Are you going to dress me now?
595;00:37:48,267;00:37:50,301;Please.
596;00:37:50,336;00:37:52,370;This stinks of manure.
596;00:37:50,336;00:37:52,370;All of it.
597;00:37:52,405;00:37:54,776;Stop-- stop it.
598;00:37:54,801;00:37:56,271;You would turn me into one
598;00:37:54,801;00:37:56,271;of them, wouldn't you?
599;00:37:56,275;00:37:57,942;Next you'll want
599;00:37:56,275;00:37:57,942;to braid my hair.
600;00:37:57,976;00:38:00,010;You've no right
600;00:37:57,976;00:38:00,010;to a braid.
601;00:38:00,044;00:38:01,511;You've won
601;00:38:00,044;00:38:01,511;no victories yet.
602;00:38:01,546;00:38:04,681;You do not
602;00:38:01,546;00:38:04,681;talk back to me!
603;00:38:05,983;00:38:08,484;You are a horselord's slut.
604;00:38:08,519;00:38:10,453;And now you've woken
604;00:38:08,519;00:38:10,453;the dragon--
605;00:38:16,093;00:38:19,663;I am a Khaleesi
605;00:38:16,093;00:38:19,663;of the Dothraki!
606;00:38:19,697;00:38:22,066;I am the wife
606;00:38:19,697;00:38:22,066;of the great Khal
607;00:38:22,100;00:38:24,869;and I carry his son
607;00:38:22,100;00:38:24,869;inside me.
608;00:38:24,903;00:38:28,673;The next time
608;00:38:24,903;00:38:28,673;you raise a hand to me
609;00:38:28,707;00:38:31,943;will be the last time
609;00:38:28,707;00:38:31,943;you have hands.
610;00:38:39,752;00:38:41,653;I know for a fact
610;00:38:39,752;00:38:41,653;that some of the officers
611;00:38:41,688;00:38:43,655;go to that brothel
611;00:38:41,688;00:38:43,655;in mole's town.
612;00:38:43,690;00:38:45,490;I wouldn't doubt it.
613;00:38:45,525;00:38:47,959;Don't you think it's
613;00:38:45,525;00:38:47,959;a little bit unfair?
614;00:38:47,993;00:38:50,128;Making us take our vows
614;00:38:47,993;00:38:50,128;while they sneak off
615;00:38:50,162;00:38:52,763;for a little
615;00:38:50,162;00:38:52,763;sally on the side?
616;00:38:52,797;00:38:55,566;Sally on the side?
616;00:38:52,797;00:38:55,566;It's silly, isn't it?
617;00:38:55,600;00:38:58,937;What, we can't defend
617;00:38:55,600;00:38:58,937;the wall unless we're celibate?
618;00:38:58,971;00:39:00,794;It's absurd.
619;00:39:00,819;00:39:02,873;I didn't think you'd be
619;00:39:00,819;00:39:02,873;so upset about it.
620;00:39:04,277;00:39:06,545;Why not?
621;00:39:06,579;00:39:09,040;Because I'm fat?
621;00:39:06,579;00:39:09,040;No.
622;00:39:09,048;00:39:12,160;But I like girls just
622;00:39:09,048;00:39:12,160;as much as you do.
623;00:39:13,287;00:39:15,856;They might not
623;00:39:13,287;00:39:15,856;like me as much.
624;00:39:17,792;00:39:21,061;I've never--
624;00:39:17,792;00:39:21,061;been with one.
625;00:39:22,396;00:39:24,331;You've probably
625;00:39:22,396;00:39:24,331;had hundreds.
626;00:39:24,365;00:39:26,033;No.
627;00:39:28,336;00:39:30,871;As a matter of fact,
628;00:39:30,906;00:39:32,339;I'm the same as you.
629;00:39:32,374;00:39:34,374;Yeah.
630;00:39:34,409;00:39:36,610;I find that hard
630;00:39:34,409;00:39:36,610;to believe.
631;00:39:36,644;00:39:38,946;I came very close once.
632;00:39:38,980;00:39:42,415;I was alone in a room
632;00:39:38,980;00:39:42,415;with a naked girl, but--
633;00:39:42,450;00:39:44,751;you didn't know
633;00:39:42,450;00:39:44,751;where to put it?
634;00:39:44,785;00:39:46,819;I know where to put it.
635;00:39:46,854;00:39:48,888;Was she...
636;00:39:48,923;00:39:51,057;Old and ugly?
637;00:39:52,092;00:39:53,859;Young and gorgeous.
638;00:39:55,495;00:39:57,396;A whore named Ros.
639;00:39:59,365;00:40:01,166;What color hair?
640;00:40:01,200;00:40:04,035;Red.
640;00:40:01,200;00:40:04,035;Oh, I like red hair.
641;00:40:05,604;00:40:07,371;And her, um...
642;00:40:07,406;00:40:09,106;Her...
643;00:40:10,208;00:40:11,808;You don't want to know.
643;00:40:10,208;00:40:11,808;That good?
644;00:40:11,843;00:40:13,610;Better.
644;00:40:11,843;00:40:13,610;Oh no.
645;00:40:15,313;00:40:17,949;So why exactly
646;00:40:17,983;00:40:21,686;did you not make love
646;00:40:17,983;00:40:21,686;to Ros with the perfect--?
647;00:40:21,720;00:40:24,189;What's my name?
648;00:40:24,223;00:40:26,125;Jon Snow?
649;00:40:26,159;00:40:29,462;And why is
649;00:40:26,159;00:40:29,462;my surname snow?
650;00:40:29,496;00:40:32,299;Because...
651;00:40:32,333;00:40:34,901;You're a bastard
651;00:40:32,333;00:40:34,901;from the North.
652;00:40:36,570;00:40:38,972;I never met my mother.
653;00:40:39,006;00:40:41,974;My father wouldn't even
653;00:40:39,006;00:40:41,974;tell me her name.
654;00:40:42,009;00:40:44,644;I don't know if she's
654;00:40:42,009;00:40:44,644;living or dead.
655;00:40:46,647;00:40:49,114;I don't know
655;00:40:46,647;00:40:49,114;if she's a noblewoman
656;00:40:49,149;00:40:50,783;or a Fisherman's wife...
657;00:40:52,485;00:40:54,486;Or a whore.
658;00:40:56,723;00:40:59,091;So I sat there
659;00:40:59,125;00:41:02,328;in the brothel as Ros
659;00:40:59,125;00:41:02,328;took off her clothes.
660;00:41:02,362;00:41:05,932;But I couldn't do it.
661;00:41:05,966;00:41:08,969;Because all I could
661;00:41:05,966;00:41:08,969;think was
662;00:41:09,003;00:41:11,672;what if I got her pregnant
663;00:41:11,706;00:41:13,741;and she had a child,
664;00:41:13,775;00:41:16,710;another bastard named Snow?
665;00:41:21,249;00:41:24,085;It's not a good life
665;00:41:21,249;00:41:24,085;for a child.
666;00:41:24,119;00:41:26,320;Ah, mmm.
667;00:41:29,124;00:41:30,958;So...
668;00:41:30,992;00:41:33,394;You didn't know
668;00:41:30,992;00:41:33,394;where to put it?
669;00:41:39,067;00:41:41,202;Enjoying yourselves?
670;00:41:43,339;00:41:45,140;You look cold, boys.
671;00:41:46,909;00:41:48,443;It is a bit nippy.
672;00:41:48,477;00:41:50,879;A bit nippy,
672;00:41:48,477;00:41:50,879;yeah, by the fire,
673;00:41:50,913;00:41:55,050;indoors.
673;00:41:50,913;00:41:55,050;It's still summer.
674;00:41:56,218;00:41:58,921;Do you boys even remember
674;00:41:56,218;00:41:58,921;the last winter?
675;00:42:00,090;00:42:02,725;How long has it been now?
675;00:42:00,090;00:42:02,725;What, 10 years?
676;00:42:02,759;00:42:04,860;I remember.
677;00:42:04,895;00:42:07,596;Was it uncomfortable
677;00:42:04,895;00:42:07,596;at Winterfell?
678;00:42:07,631;00:42:10,266;Were there days when
678;00:42:07,631;00:42:10,266;you just couldn't get warm,
679;00:42:10,300;00:42:13,135;never mind how many fires
679;00:42:10,300;00:42:13,135;your servants built?
680;00:42:13,170;00:42:16,371;I build my own fires.
680;00:42:13,170;00:42:16,371;That's admirable.
681;00:42:17,907;00:42:20,575;I spent six months out there,
681;00:42:17,907;00:42:20,575;beyond The Wall
682;00:42:20,610;00:42:23,512;during the last winter.
683;00:42:23,547;00:42:26,649;It was supposed to be
683;00:42:23,547;00:42:26,649;a two-week mission.
684;00:42:26,684;00:42:30,119;We heard a rumor Mance Rayder
684;00:42:26,684;00:42:30,119;was planning to attack Eastwatch.
685;00:42:30,154;00:42:33,523;So we went out to look
685;00:42:30,154;00:42:33,523;for some of his men--
686;00:42:33,557;00:42:36,459;capture them,
686;00:42:33,557;00:42:36,459;gather some knowledge.
687;00:42:36,494;00:42:39,462;The Wildlings who fight
687;00:42:36,494;00:42:39,462;for Mance Rayder are hard men.
688;00:42:39,497;00:42:42,531;Harder than you'll ever be.
689;00:42:42,566;00:42:45,000;They know their country
689;00:42:42,566;00:42:45,000;better than we do.
690;00:42:45,035;00:42:47,370;They knew there was
690;00:42:45,035;00:42:47,370;a storm coming in.
691;00:42:48,705;00:42:51,674;So they hid in their caves
691;00:42:48,705;00:42:51,674;and waited for it to pass.
692;00:42:53,243;00:42:55,644;And we got caught
692;00:42:53,243;00:42:55,644;in the open.
693;00:42:55,678;00:42:57,980;Wind so strong
694;00:42:58,014;00:43:00,516;it yanked 100-foot trees
694;00:42:58,014;00:43:00,516;straight from the ground,
695;00:43:00,550;00:43:03,019;roots and all.
695;00:43:00,550;00:43:03,019;If you took your gloves off
696;00:43:03,053;00:43:05,054;to find your cock
696;00:43:03,053;00:43:05,054;to have a piss,
697;00:43:05,089;00:43:07,390;you lost a finger
697;00:43:05,089;00:43:07,390;to the frost.
698;00:43:07,424;00:43:09,758;And all in darkness.
699;00:43:12,996;00:43:15,464;You don't know cold.
700;00:43:15,498;00:43:17,899;Neither of you do.
701;00:43:20,036;00:43:22,671;The horses died first.
702;00:43:24,507;00:43:27,609;We didn't have enough to feed them,
702;00:43:24,507;00:43:27,609;to keep them warm.
703;00:43:29,879;00:43:32,314;Eating the horses was easy.
704;00:43:34,283;00:43:37,385;But later when we
704;00:43:34,283;00:43:37,385;started to fall...
705;00:43:39,121;00:43:41,389;That wasn't easy.
706;00:43:41,423;00:43:44,958;We should have had a couple of
706;00:43:41,423;00:43:44,958;boys like you along, shouldn't we?
707;00:43:50,698;00:43:52,932;Soft, fat boys like you.
708;00:43:52,967;00:43:55,436;We'd have lasted
708;00:43:52,967;00:43:55,436;a fortnight on you
709;00:43:55,470;00:43:58,506;and still had bones
709;00:43:55,470;00:43:58,506;leftover for soup.
710;00:44:01,109;00:44:04,012;Soon we'll have
710;00:44:01,109;00:44:04,012;new recruits
711;00:44:04,046;00:44:07,082;and you lot will be passed along
711;00:44:04,046;00:44:07,082;to the Lord Commander
712;00:44:07,116;00:44:09,251;for assignment
713;00:44:09,285;00:44:13,222;and they will call you
713;00:44:09,285;00:44:13,222;men of The Night's Watch,
714;00:44:13,257;00:44:15,991;but you'd be fools
714;00:44:13,257;00:44:15,991;to believe it.
715;00:44:17,561;00:44:19,428;You're boys still.
716;00:44:19,462;00:44:22,564;And come the winter
716;00:44:19,462;00:44:22,564;you will die...
717;00:44:24,366;00:44:26,700;Like flies.
718;00:44:32,406;00:44:34,775;I hit him.
719;00:44:34,809;00:44:36,710;I hit the dragon.
720;00:44:36,745;00:44:39,180;Your brother Rhaegar
720;00:44:36,745;00:44:39,180;was the Last Dragon.
721;00:44:39,214;00:44:42,117;Viserys is less than
721;00:44:39,214;00:44:42,117;the shadow of a snake.
722;00:44:42,151;00:44:44,019;He is still
722;00:44:42,151;00:44:44,019;the true king.
723;00:44:44,053;00:44:46,054;The truth now:
724;00:44:46,089;00:44:49,358;Do you want to see your brother
724;00:44:46,089;00:44:49,358;sitting on the Iron Throne?
725;00:44:50,260;00:44:51,894;No.
726;00:44:51,928;00:44:54,830;But the common people
726;00:44:51,928;00:44:54,830;are waiting for him.
727;00:44:54,865;00:44:59,201;Illyrio said they are sewing dragon
727;00:44:54,865;00:44:59,201;banners and praying for his return.
728;00:44:59,235;00:45:03,371;The common people pray for rain,
728;00:44:59,235;00:45:03,371;health and a summer that never ends.
729;00:45:03,406;00:45:06,874;They don't care what games
729;00:45:03,406;00:45:06,874;the high lords play.
730;00:45:06,908;00:45:09,743;What do you pray for,
730;00:45:06,908;00:45:09,743;Ser Jorah?
731;00:45:13,814;00:45:16,783;Home.
732;00:45:16,817;00:45:18,985;I pray for home too.
733;00:45:22,323;00:45:25,459;My brother will never take back
733;00:45:22,323;00:45:25,459;the Seven Kingdoms.
734;00:45:27,128;00:45:30,431;He couldn't lead an army
734;00:45:27,128;00:45:30,431;even if my husband gave him one.
735;00:45:33,802;00:45:36,237;He'll never take us home.
736;00:45:55,691;00:45:58,059;Lover's quarrel?
737;00:45:58,094;00:45:59,895;I'm sorry.
737;00:45:58,094;00:45:59,895;Do I...?
738;00:45:59,929;00:46:03,032;Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish.
738;00:45:59,929;00:46:03,032;He's known--
739;00:46:03,067;00:46:04,567;an old friend
739;00:46:03,067;00:46:04,567;of the family.
740;00:46:04,602;00:46:07,805;I've known your mother
740;00:46:04,602;00:46:07,805;a long long time.
741;00:46:07,839;00:46:10,140;Why do they call you Littlefinger?
741;00:46:07,839;00:46:10,140;Arya!
742;00:46:10,175;00:46:13,143;Don't be rude!
742;00:46:10,175;00:46:13,143;No, it's quite all right.
743;00:46:13,178;00:46:16,813;When I was a child
743;00:46:13,178;00:46:16,813;I was very small
744;00:46:16,848;00:46:19,716;and I come from a little spit of land
744;00:46:16,848;00:46:19,716;called The Fingers,
745;00:46:19,750;00:46:21,518;so you see,
746;00:46:21,552;00:46:23,619;it's an exceedingly
746;00:46:21,552;00:46:23,619;clever nickname.
747;00:46:23,654;00:46:26,188;I've been sitting here
747;00:46:23,654;00:46:26,188;for days!
748;00:46:26,223;00:46:28,223;Start the damn joust
749;00:46:28,258;00:46:30,192;before I piss myself!
750;00:46:37,733;00:46:40,302;Gods, who is that?
751;00:46:40,336;00:46:42,838;Ser Gregor Clegane.
752;00:46:42,873;00:46:45,975;They call him the Mountain.
753;00:46:47,411;00:46:50,080;The hound's older brother.
754;00:46:50,114;00:46:53,083;And his opponent?
754;00:46:50,114;00:46:53,083;Littlefinger: Ser Hugh of the Vale.
755;00:46:53,118;00:46:55,519;He was
755;00:46:53,118;00:46:55,519;Jon Arryn's squire.
756;00:46:55,553;00:46:57,220;Lo how far he's come.
757;00:46:57,255;00:46:59,489;Yes yes, enough
757;00:46:57,255;00:46:59,489;of the bloody pomp.
758;00:46:59,524;00:47:00,990;Have at it!
759;00:48:21,009;00:48:24,045;Not what you
759;00:48:21,009;00:48:24,045;were expecting?
760;00:48:26,883;00:48:30,652;Has anyone ever told you the story
760;00:48:26,883;00:48:30,652;of the Mountain and the Hound?
761;00:48:31,855;00:48:34,290;Lovely little tale
761;00:48:31,855;00:48:34,290;of brotherly love.
762;00:48:35,725;00:48:38,594;The Hound was just a pup,
763;00:48:38,628;00:48:41,029;six years old maybe.
764;00:48:41,063;00:48:43,265;Gregor a few years older--
765;00:48:43,299;00:48:46,735;already a big lad, already
765;00:48:43,299;00:48:46,735;getting a bit of a reputation.
766;00:48:46,769;00:48:49,204;Some lucky boys
767;00:48:49,238;00:48:52,407;just born with a talent
767;00:48:49,238;00:48:52,407;for violence.
768;00:48:53,776;00:48:57,079;One evening Gregor found
768;00:48:53,776;00:48:57,079;his little brother
769;00:48:57,113;00:48:59,749;playing with a toy
769;00:48:57,113;00:48:59,749;by the fire--
770;00:48:59,783;00:49:01,984;Gregor's toy,
771;00:49:02,018;00:49:04,420;a wooden knight.
772;00:49:04,454;00:49:06,922;Gregor never said a word,
773;00:49:06,957;00:49:09,725;he just grabbed his brother
773;00:49:06,957;00:49:09,725;by the scruff of his neck
774;00:49:09,760;00:49:12,962;and shoved his face
774;00:49:09,760;00:49:12,962;into the burning coals.
775;00:49:12,996;00:49:15,231;Held him there
776;00:49:15,265;00:49:17,233;while the boy screamed,
777;00:49:17,267;00:49:19,668;while his face melted.
778;00:49:23,773;00:49:26,542;There aren't very many people
778;00:49:23,773;00:49:26,542;who know that story.
779;00:49:26,577;00:49:29,245;I won't tell anyone.
779;00:49:26,577;00:49:29,245;I promise.
780;00:49:29,279;00:49:31,180;No, please don't.
781;00:49:31,215;00:49:33,649;If the Hound so much as
781;00:49:31,215;00:49:33,649;heard you mention it,
782;00:49:33,683;00:49:36,685;I'm afraid all the knights
782;00:49:33,683;00:49:36,685;in King's Landing
783;00:49:36,719;00:49:39,054;would not be able
783;00:49:36,719;00:49:39,054;to save you.
784;00:49:51,698;00:49:54,800;My Lord,
784;00:49:51,698;00:49:54,800;her Grace the Queen.
785;00:49:57,870;00:50:00,472;Your Grace.
785;00:49:57,870;00:50:00,472;You're missing your tournament.
786;00:50:00,506;00:50:03,074;Putting my name on it
786;00:50:00,506;00:50:03,074;doesn't make it mine.
787;00:50:05,111;00:50:08,313;I thought we might put what happened
787;00:50:05,111;00:50:08,313;on the Kingsroad behind us--
788;00:50:08,347;00:50:10,582;the ugliness
788;00:50:08,347;00:50:10,582;with the wolves.
789;00:50:12,752;00:50:15,354;And forcing you to kill
789;00:50:12,752;00:50:15,354;the beast was extreme.
790;00:50:16,990;00:50:20,093;Though sometimes we go to extremes
790;00:50:16,990;00:50:20,093;where our children are concerned.
791;00:50:21,528;00:50:23,329;How is Sansa?
792;00:50:23,364;00:50:25,265;She likes it here.
793;00:50:25,299;00:50:27,033;She's the only
793;00:50:25,299;00:50:27,033;Stark who does.
794;00:50:27,068;00:50:29,569;Favors her mother,
795;00:50:29,603;00:50:31,371;not much
795;00:50:29,603;00:50:31,371;of the North in her.
796;00:50:31,405;00:50:34,808;What are you doing here?
796;00:50:31,405;00:50:34,808;I might ask the same of you.
797;00:50:34,842;00:50:37,010;What is it you
797;00:50:34,842;00:50:37,010;hope to accomplish?
798;00:50:37,044;00:50:40,113;The King called on me
798;00:50:37,044;00:50:40,113;to serve him and the realm,
799;00:50:40,148;00:50:42,882;and that's what I'll do
799;00:50:40,148;00:50:42,882;until he tells me otherwise.
800;00:50:42,917;00:50:45,384;You can't change him.
800;00:50:42,917;00:50:45,384;You can't help him.
801;00:50:45,419;00:50:47,987;He'll do what he wants, which is
801;00:50:45,419;00:50:47,987;all he's ever done.
802;00:50:48,021;00:50:50,989;You'll try your best
802;00:50:48,021;00:50:50,989;to pick up the pieces.
803;00:50:51,024;00:50:53,759;If that's my job,
803;00:50:51,024;00:50:53,759;then so be it.
804;00:50:55,261;00:50:57,697;You're just a soldier,
804;00:50:55,261;00:50:57,697;aren't you?
805;00:50:57,731;00:51:00,466;You take your orders
805;00:50:57,731;00:51:00,466;and you carry on.
806;00:51:01,502;00:51:03,669;I suppose it makes sense.
807;00:51:03,704;00:51:07,040;Your older brother was trained to
807;00:51:03,704;00:51:07,040;lead and you were trained to follow.
808;00:51:07,074;00:51:10,042;I was also trained to kill
808;00:51:07,074;00:51:10,042;my enemies, your Grace.
809;00:51:13,481;00:51:15,582;As was I.
810;00:51:33,466;00:51:35,434;Seven blessings to you,
810;00:51:33,466;00:51:35,434;goodfolk!
811;00:51:35,468;00:51:37,803;And to you.
812;00:51:37,837;00:51:39,804;Boy!
812;00:51:37,837;00:51:39,804;Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.
813;00:51:39,839;00:51:42,240;Ah, good idea, grandfather.
813;00:51:39,839;00:51:42,240;I'm starving.
814;00:51:42,274;00:51:44,075;A song
814;00:51:42,274;00:51:44,075;while we wait or--?
815;00:51:44,109;00:51:45,910;I'd rather throw myself
815;00:51:44,109;00:51:45,910;down a well.
816;00:51:45,944;00:51:49,580;Now now, grandfather, this may be your
816;00:51:45,944;00:51:49,580;last chance if you're heading North.
817;00:51:49,615;00:51:52,617;The only music the Northerners know is
817;00:51:49,615;00:51:52,617;the howling of wolves!
818;00:51:54,720;00:51:56,387;Gods.
819;00:51:56,421;00:51:57,922;I'm sorry, My Lord.
819;00:51:56,421;00:51:57,922;We're full up.
820;00:51:57,956;00:52:00,958;Every room.
820;00:51:57,956;00:52:00,958;Tyrion: My men can sleep in the stable.
821;00:52:00,993;00:52:03,628;As for myself, I don't
821;00:52:00,993;00:52:03,628;require a large room.
822;00:52:03,662;00:52:06,831;Truly, My Lord,
822;00:52:03,662;00:52:06,831;we have nothing.
823;00:52:06,865;00:52:09,200;Is there nothing I can do...
824;00:52:09,234;00:52:11,803;...To remedy this?
825;00:52:11,837;00:52:13,705;You can have my room.
826;00:52:13,739;00:52:15,273;Now there's
826;00:52:13,739;00:52:15,273;a clever man.
827;00:52:17,176;00:52:19,911;You can manage food, I trust?
827;00:52:17,176;00:52:19,911;Yoren, dine with me.
828;00:52:19,945;00:52:22,047;Aye, My Lord.
828;00:52:19,945;00:52:22,047;My Lord of Lannister!
829;00:52:22,081;00:52:24,182;Might I entertain you
829;00:52:22,081;00:52:24,182;while you eat?
830;00:52:24,216;00:52:27,118;I can sing of your father's victory
830;00:52:24,216;00:52:27,118;at King's Landing!
831;00:52:27,152;00:52:29,786;Nothing would more likely
831;00:52:27,152;00:52:29,786;ruin my supper.
832;00:52:30,755;00:52:32,422;Lady Stark!
833;00:52:32,456;00:52:35,158;What an unexpected
833;00:52:32,456;00:52:35,158;pleasure.
834;00:52:36,527;00:52:38,728;I was sorry to have
834;00:52:36,527;00:52:38,728;missed you at Winterfell.
835;00:52:38,763;00:52:40,630;Lady Stark!
836;00:52:48,472;00:52:50,640;I was still Catelyn Tully
837;00:52:50,675;00:52:53,176;the last time
837;00:52:50,675;00:52:53,176;I stayed here.
838;00:52:55,547;00:52:58,315;You, Ser,
839;00:52:58,349;00:53:02,586;is that the black bat of Harrenhal
839;00:52:58,349;00:53:02,586;I see embroidered on your coat?
840;00:53:02,620;00:53:04,655;It is, My Lady.
841;00:53:04,689;00:53:07,525;And is Lady Whent
841;00:53:04,689;00:53:07,525;a true and honest friend
842;00:53:07,560;00:53:11,363;to my father, Lord Hoster Tully
842;00:53:07,560;00:53:11,363;of Riverrun?
843;00:53:11,398;00:53:13,166;She is.
844;00:53:15,302;00:53:18,671;The red stallion was always
844;00:53:15,302;00:53:18,671;a welcome sight at Riverrun.
845;00:53:18,705;00:53:20,907;My father counts
845;00:53:18,705;00:53:20,907;Jonas Bracken
846;00:53:20,941;00:53:24,043;amongst his oldest
846;00:53:20,941;00:53:24,043;and most loyal bannermen.
847;00:53:24,077;00:53:25,945;Our lord is honored
847;00:53:24,077;00:53:25,945;by his trust.
848;00:53:25,979;00:53:28,281;I envy your father
849;00:53:28,315;00:53:29,982;all his fine friends,
849;00:53:28,315;00:53:29,982;Lady Stark,
850;00:53:30,017;00:53:33,086;but I don't quite see
850;00:53:30,017;00:53:33,086;the purpose of this.
851;00:53:34,888;00:53:36,956;I know your sigil as well--
852;00:53:38,259;00:53:40,660;the Twin Towers
852;00:53:38,259;00:53:40,660;of Frey.
853;00:53:40,695;00:53:42,963;How fares your lord, Ser?
854;00:53:42,997;00:53:44,965;Lord Walder is well,
854;00:53:42,997;00:53:44,965;My Lady.
855;00:53:44,999;00:53:47,801;He has asked your father
855;00:53:44,999;00:53:47,801;for the honor of his presence
856;00:53:47,835;00:53:49,403;on his 90th Nameday.
857;00:53:49,437;00:53:51,705;He plans to take another wife.
858;00:53:58,413;00:54:00,882;This man
859;00:54:00,916;00:54:03,251;came into my house
859;00:54:00,916;00:54:03,251;as a guest
860;00:54:03,285;00:54:07,187;and there conspired
860;00:54:03,285;00:54:07,187;to murder my son,
861;00:54:07,222;00:54:10,725;a boy of 10.
862;00:54:12,327;00:54:15,596;In the name of King Robert
862;00:54:12,327;00:54:15,596;and the good lords you serve,
863;00:54:15,631;00:54:18,399;I call upon you
863;00:54:15,631;00:54:18,399;to seize him
864;00:54:18,433;00:54:22,003;and help me return him
864;00:54:18,433;00:54:22,003;to Winterfell
865;00:54:22,037;00:54:24,072;to await the King's Justice.
