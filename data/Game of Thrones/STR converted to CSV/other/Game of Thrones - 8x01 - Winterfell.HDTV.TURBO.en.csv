1;00:04:20,985;00:04:22,903;You should
1;00:04:20,985;00:04:22,903;consider yourself lucky.
2;00:04:24,444;00:04:26,277;At least your balls
2;00:04:24,444;00:04:26,277;won't freeze off.
3;00:04:26,361;00:04:28,486;You take great offense at dwarf jokes,
4;00:04:28,569;00:04:31,110;but love telling eunuch jokes.
4;00:04:28,569;00:04:31,110;Why is that?
5;00:04:32,361;00:04:35,277;Because I have balls,
5;00:04:32,361;00:04:35,277;and you don't.
6;00:05:02,819;00:05:04,319;I warned you.
7;00:05:04,402;00:05:07,152;Northerners don't much trust
7;00:05:04,402;00:05:07,152;outsiders.
8;00:06:28,778;00:06:30,319;Look at you.
9;00:06:31,486;00:06:32,736;You're a man.
10;00:06:33,736;00:06:34,778;Almost.
11;00:06:54,444;00:06:57,319;Where's Arya?
11;00:06:54,444;00:06:57,319;Lurking somewhere.
12;00:07:03,944;00:07:06,402;Queen Daenerys
12;00:07:03,944;00:07:06,402;of House Targaryen.
13;00:07:07,694;00:07:11,527;My sister, Sansa Stark,
13;00:07:07,694;00:07:11,527;the Lady of Winterfell.
14;00:07:11,611;00:07:14,569;Thank you for inviting us
14;00:07:11,611;00:07:14,569;into your home, Lady Stark.
15;00:07:14,653;00:07:16,027;The North is as beautiful
16;00:07:16,110;00:07:19,444;as your brother claimed,
16;00:07:16,110;00:07:19,444;as are you.
17;00:07:22,944;00:07:25,319;Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.
18;00:07:26,778;00:07:28,611;We don't have time for all this.
19;00:07:28,694;00:07:32,486;The Night King has your dragon.
19;00:07:28,694;00:07:32,486;He's one of them now.
20;00:07:33,486;00:07:34,944;The Wall has fallen,
21;00:07:35,027;00:07:37,194;the dead march south.
22;00:07:42,486;00:07:44,402;As soon as we heard about the Wall,
23;00:07:44,486;00:07:47,611;I called all our banners
23;00:07:44,486;00:07:47,611;to retreat to Winterfell.
24;00:07:48,861;00:07:49,861;Lord Umber...
25;00:07:51,194;00:07:54,152;when can we expect
25;00:07:51,194;00:07:54,152;your people to arrive?
26;00:07:58,361;00:08:02,319;We need more horses and wagons,
26;00:07:58,361;00:08:02,319;if it please my lady.
27;00:08:04,653;00:08:06,277;And my lord.
28;00:08:08,611;00:08:12,110;And my queen.
28;00:08:08,611;00:08:12,110;Sorry.
29;00:08:12,194;00:08:14,152;You'll have as many
29;00:08:12,194;00:08:14,152;as we can spare.
30;00:08:14,235;00:08:17,444;Hurry back to Last Hearth
30;00:08:14,235;00:08:17,444;and bring your people here.
31;00:08:20,361;00:08:23,152;We need to send ravens
31;00:08:20,361;00:08:23,152;to the Night's Watch as well.
32;00:08:23,235;00:08:25,694;There's no sense in
32;00:08:23,235;00:08:25,694;manning the castles anymore.
33;00:08:25,778;00:08:26,861;We make our stand here.
34;00:08:26,944;00:08:28,027;At once, Your Grace.
35;00:08:29,027;00:08:30,569;Your Grace.
36;00:08:36,194;00:08:38,069;But you're not. Are you?
37;00:08:39,027;00:08:40,527;You left Winterfell a king
38;00:08:40,611;00:08:42,027;and came back a...
39;00:08:44,527;00:08:46,486;I'm not sure what you are now.
40;00:08:46,569;00:08:49,110;A lord?
41;00:08:49,194;00:08:51,486;Nothing at all?
42;00:08:51,569;00:08:53,778;It's not important.
42;00:08:51,569;00:08:53,778;Not important?
43;00:08:54,944;00:08:57,152;We named you King in the North.
44;00:08:58,736;00:09:00,235;King of the North!
45;00:09:05,361;00:09:07,110;You did, my lady.
46;00:09:08,653;00:09:10,486;It was the honor of my life.
47;00:09:10,569;00:09:13,277;I'll always be grateful
47;00:09:10,569;00:09:13,277;for your faith.
48;00:09:15,402;00:09:16,653;But when I left Winterfell,
49;00:09:16,736;00:09:19,402;I told you
49;00:09:16,736;00:09:19,402;we need allies or we will die.
50;00:09:20,569;00:09:22,277;I have brought those allies home
51;00:09:22,361;00:09:24,444;to fight alongside us.
52;00:09:25,736;00:09:27,402;I had a choice,
53;00:09:27,486;00:09:31,527;keep my crown
53;00:09:27,486;00:09:31,527;or protect the North.
54;00:09:31,611;00:09:33,486;I chose the North.
55;00:09:45,861;00:09:48,194;If anyone survives
55;00:09:45,861;00:09:48,194;the war to come,
56;00:09:48,277;00:09:49,944;we'll have Jon Snow to thank.
57;00:09:51,402;00:09:53,861;He risked his life
57;00:09:51,402;00:09:53,861;to show us the threat is real.
58;00:09:53,944;00:09:55,736;Thanks to his courage,
59;00:09:55,819;00:09:57,861;we have brought with us
59;00:09:55,819;00:09:57,861;the greatest army
60;00:09:57,944;00:09:59,027;the world has ever seen.
61;00:09:59,110;00:10:02,319;We have brought
61;00:09:59,110;00:10:02,319;two full-grown dragons.
62;00:10:04,486;00:10:05,861;And soon, the Lannister army
63;00:10:05,944;00:10:08,027;will ride north
63;00:10:05,944;00:10:08,027;to join our cause.
64;00:10:12,653;00:10:14,152;I know, I know, our people
65;00:10:14,235;00:10:16,819;haven't been friends
65;00:10:14,235;00:10:16,819;in the past.
66;00:10:19,152;00:10:20,861;But we must
66;00:10:19,152;00:10:20,861;fight together now...
67;00:10:21,985;00:10:22,985;or die.
68;00:10:25,027;00:10:27,486;May I ask,
68;00:10:25,027;00:10:27,486;how are we meant to feed
69;00:10:27,569;00:10:29,527;the greatest army
69;00:10:27,569;00:10:29,527;the world has ever seen?
70;00:10:29,611;00:10:32,235;While I ensured our stores
70;00:10:29,611;00:10:32,235;would last through winter,
71;00:10:32,319;00:10:34,069;I didn't account for Dothraki,
72;00:10:34,152;00:10:37,861;Unsullied
72;00:10:34,152;00:10:37,861;and two full-grown dragons.
73;00:10:39,486;00:10:41,486;What do dragons eat, anyway?
74;00:10:43,653;00:10:44,985;Whatever they want.
75;00:11:03,444;00:11:07,277;Hey, careful, lads.
75;00:11:03,444;00:11:07,277;We need every last bit of it.
76;00:11:07,361;00:11:08,653;Sorry 'bout that.
77;00:11:12,861;00:11:14,486;Are these the last
77;00:11:12,861;00:11:14,486;of the wagons?
78;00:11:14,569;00:11:15,985;Aye.
79;00:11:16,069;00:11:18,694;All right, let's get it
79;00:11:16,069;00:11:18,694;all to the forges.
80;00:11:26,694;00:11:27,694;My lord.
81;00:11:29,861;00:11:30,861;My lady.
82;00:11:37,486;00:11:38,527;My lady.
83;00:11:50,527;00:11:51,944;The Lady of Winterfell.
84;00:11:53,778;00:11:55,736;Has a nice ring to it.
85;00:11:55,819;00:11:57,694;So does Hand of the Queen.
86;00:11:58,985;00:12:01,027;Depending on the queen,
86;00:11:58,985;00:12:01,027;I suppose.
87;00:12:03,736;00:12:06,444;Last time we spoke
87;00:12:03,736;00:12:06,444;was at Joffrey's wedding.
88;00:12:07,736;00:12:10,527;Miserable affair.
88;00:12:07,736;00:12:10,527;It had its moments.
89;00:12:16,235;00:12:18,527;Apologies for leaving like that.
90;00:12:18,611;00:12:20,152;Yes,
90;00:12:18,611;00:12:20,152;it was a bit hard to explain
91;00:12:20,235;00:12:22,985;why my wife fled
91;00:12:20,235;00:12:22,985;moments after the king's murder.
92;00:12:25,569;00:12:26,778;We both survived.
93;00:12:29,736;00:12:31,444;Many underestimated you.
94;00:12:32,694;00:12:34,277;Most of them are dead now.
95;00:12:42,235;00:12:43,944;I'm sure
95;00:12:42,235;00:12:43,944;you weren't thrilled to hear
96;00:12:44,027;00:12:45,903;the Lannister
96;00:12:44,027;00:12:45,903;army's marching north.
97;00:12:48,069;00:12:51,194;You have every right
97;00:12:48,069;00:12:51,194;to be fearful of my sister.
98;00:12:51,277;00:12:52,736;No one fears her more than I do.
99;00:12:52,819;00:12:55,736;But I promise, you'll be safe...
99;00:12:52,819;00:12:55,736;Cersei told you her army
100;00:12:55,819;00:12:58,569;was coming north
100;00:12:55,819;00:12:58,569;to fight for you?
101;00:12:58,653;00:12:59,653;She did.
102;00:13:01,277;00:13:02,694;And you believed her?
103;00:13:04,110;00:13:05,819;She has something
103;00:13:04,110;00:13:05,819;to live for now.
104;00:13:05,903;00:13:08,694;I believe she wants to survive.
105;00:13:11,152;00:13:13,653;I used to think you were
105;00:13:11,152;00:13:13,653;the cleverest man alive.
106;00:13:45,653;00:13:47,319;You used to be taller.
107;00:13:50,110;00:13:51,653;How did you sneak up on me?
108;00:13:51,736;00:13:54,569;How did you survive
108;00:13:51,736;00:13:54,569;a knife through the heart?
109;00:13:54,653;00:13:56,152;I didn't.
110;00:14:14,486;00:14:15,736;You still have it.
111;00:14:18,944;00:14:20,152;Needle.
112;00:14:22,194;00:14:24,069;Have you ever used it?
113;00:14:24,985;00:14:26,736;Once or twice.
114;00:14:42,069;00:14:43,903;Valyrian steel.
115;00:14:45,486;00:14:46,486;Jealous?
116;00:14:46,527;00:14:49,694;Too heavy for me.
117;00:14:57,861;00:14:59,736;Where were you before?
118;00:14:59,819;00:15:02,527;I could've used your help
118;00:14:59,819;00:15:02,527;with Sansa.
119;00:15:04,569;00:15:06,778;She doesn't like your queen,
119;00:15:04,569;00:15:06,778;does she?
120;00:15:06,861;00:15:09,611;Sansa thinks
120;00:15:06,861;00:15:09,611;she's smarter than everyone.
121;00:15:10,944;00:15:12,985;She's the smartest person
121;00:15:10,944;00:15:12,985;I've ever met.
122;00:15:14,361;00:15:15,653;Now you're defending her?
123;00:15:15,736;00:15:17,110;You?
124;00:15:18,444;00:15:20,235;I'm defending our family.
125;00:15:21,611;00:15:22,778;So is she.
126;00:15:22,861;00:15:24,277;Yeah.
127;00:15:25,736;00:15:27,319;I'm her family too.
128;00:15:33,361;00:15:34,611;Don't forget that.
129;00:15:52,444;00:15:55,819;Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring
129;00:15:52,444;00:15:55,819;terrible news.
130;00:15:56,985;00:15:58,985;The dead have
130;00:15:56,985;00:15:58,985;broken through the Wall.
131;00:16:02,611;00:16:03,861;Good.
132;00:16:38,069;00:16:40,444;Why don't you just
132;00:16:38,069;00:16:40,444;get it over with and kill me?
133;00:16:40,527;00:16:43,486;But we're family.
134;00:16:44,694;00:16:47,444;The last Greyjoys
134;00:16:44,694;00:16:47,444;left in the world.
135;00:16:50,361;00:16:52,611;The last ones with balls anyway.
136;00:16:57,569;00:16:58,903;If I kill you...
137;00:17:00,361;00:17:01,861;who can I talk to?
138;00:17:02,778;00:17:04,152;Hmm?
139;00:17:06,694;00:17:09,027;I've got a crew full of mutes.
140;00:17:12,361;00:17:14,069;It gets lonely at sea.
141;00:17:16,819;00:17:18,736;Are we in King's Landing?
142;00:17:18,819;00:17:19,903;Mm.
143;00:17:24,444;00:17:26,569;You picked the losing side.
144;00:17:30,235;00:17:32,903;Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet
144;00:17:30,235;00:17:32,903;somewhere else.
145;00:17:39,985;00:17:42,903;But first
145;00:17:39,985;00:17:42,903;I'm gonna fuck the queen.
146;00:17:56,444;00:17:58,194;Twenty-thousand men, is it?
147;00:17:58,277;00:18:01,319;Yes, Your Grace.
147;00:17:58,277;00:18:01,319;A few died in transit.
148;00:18:03,611;00:18:05,110;They cheated at dice.
149;00:18:07,069;00:18:09,027;Or maybe I cheated.
150;00:18:09,110;00:18:10,235;Someone cheated.
151;00:18:12,319;00:18:14,861;They weren't good fighters.
151;00:18:12,319;00:18:14,861;You won't miss them.
152;00:18:14,944;00:18:16,861;Horses?
152;00:18:14,944;00:18:16,861;Two thousand.
153;00:18:16,944;00:18:18,194;And elephants?
154;00:18:18,277;00:18:20,653;Uh, no elephants,
154;00:18:18,277;00:18:20,653;Your Grace.
155;00:18:22,277;00:18:23,444;That's disappointing.
156;00:18:24,819;00:18:26,985;I was told the Golden Company
156;00:18:24,819;00:18:26,985;had elephants.
157;00:18:27,069;00:18:29,444;They are excellent beasts,
157;00:18:27,069;00:18:29,444;Your Grace,
158;00:18:29,527;00:18:33,027;but not well-suited
158;00:18:29,527;00:18:33,027;to long sea voyages.
159;00:18:33,110;00:18:34,653;In any event,
159;00:18:33,110;00:18:34,653;you are most welcome
160;00:18:34,736;00:18:36,903;here in King's Landing,
160;00:18:34,736;00:18:36,903;Captain Strickland.
161;00:18:36,985;00:18:40,194;We look forward to fighting
161;00:18:36,985;00:18:40,194;on your behalf, Your Grace.
162;00:18:51,152;00:18:52,819;Am I most welcome here?
163;00:18:54,319;00:18:56,944;You are a true friend
163;00:18:54,319;00:18:56,944;of the crown
164;00:18:57,027;00:18:58,903;and an honored guest.
165;00:18:58,985;00:19:00,235;Good.
166;00:19:00,319;00:19:03,361;As a true friend
166;00:19:00,319;00:19:03,361;and an honored guest...
167;00:19:12,194;00:19:15,361;I was hoping we could talk in private.
168;00:19:16,569;00:19:18,778;After the war.
168;00:19:16,569;00:19:18,778;That was our agreement.
169;00:19:18,861;00:19:22,694;Wars sometimes last years.
170;00:19:23,861;00:19:26,361;You want a whore, buy one.
171;00:19:28,152;00:19:29,527;You want a queen...
172;00:19:30,819;00:19:32,527;earn her.
173;00:19:35,402;00:19:36,402;How?
174;00:19:37,486;00:19:38,819;I've given her justice,
175;00:19:38,903;00:19:41,611;an army and the Iron Fleet,
176;00:19:41,694;00:19:44,736;yet she gives me
176;00:19:41,694;00:19:44,736;no sign of affection.
177;00:19:45,694;00:19:47,861;My heart is nearly broken.
178;00:19:50,152;00:19:51,402;You're insolent.
179;00:19:53,110;00:19:57,527;I've executed men for less.
179;00:19:53,110;00:19:57,527;They were lesser men.
180;00:20:36,319;00:20:39,235;I hear the dragon burnt up
180;00:20:36,319;00:20:39,235;a thousand Lannister men.
181;00:20:39,319;00:20:41,235;Burnt up some of my favorite boys.
182;00:20:41,319;00:20:42,985;Archie, was it?
182;00:20:41,319;00:20:42,985;And William.
183;00:20:43,069;00:20:46,069;Tall handsome William?
183;00:20:43,069;00:20:46,069;Yeah, tall handsome William.
184;00:20:46,152;00:20:48,819;They said what's left of him
184;00:20:46,152;00:20:48,819;could fit in a wine glass.
185;00:20:48,903;00:20:52,361;I am the only man you ever met
185;00:20:48,903;00:20:52,361;who shot a dragon.
186;00:20:52,444;00:20:54,194;Did you?
186;00:20:52,444;00:20:54,194;Nearly killed it.
187;00:20:54,277;00:20:55,277;That's brave.
188;00:21:05,569;00:21:08,110;That boy Eddie...
188;00:21:05,569;00:21:08,110;The ginger?
189;00:21:08,194;00:21:11,361;That's him. Came back
189;00:21:08,194;00:21:11,361;with his face burnt right off.
190;00:21:11,444;00:21:12,694;He's got no eyelids now.
191;00:21:12,778;00:21:14,402;How does he sleep
191;00:21:12,778;00:21:14,402;with no eyelids?
192;00:21:14,486;00:21:16,985;All right, can we stop talking
192;00:21:14,486;00:21:16,985;about the fucking dragons now?
193;00:21:17,069;00:21:18,944;Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
194;00:21:21,152;00:21:22,235;You're kidding me.
195;00:21:22,319;00:21:23,736;Apologies for the interruption,
196;00:21:23,819;00:21:26,152;but the queen
196;00:21:23,819;00:21:26,152;did urge me to hurry.
197;00:21:28,569;00:21:29,778;Sorry, ladies.
198;00:21:31,819;00:21:33,361;Another time perhaps.
199;00:21:41,069;00:21:44,819;You ever get lonely,
199;00:21:41,069;00:21:44,819;I am partial to older gentlemen.
200;00:21:47,861;00:21:51,110;Poor girl. The pox will take her
200;00:21:47,861;00:21:51,110;within the year.
201;00:21:52,736;00:21:54,736;Which girl?
201;00:21:52,736;00:21:54,736;The queen's brothers
202;00:21:54,819;00:21:57,444;made promises to you
202;00:21:54,819;00:21:57,444;and broke them.
203;00:21:57,527;00:21:59,819;Her Grace wants to rectify
203;00:21:57,527;00:21:59,819;their mistake.
204;00:22:01,527;00:22:03,944;She once gave me
204;00:22:01,527;00:22:03,944;a castle and a wife,
205;00:22:04,027;00:22:05,694;then rectified me
205;00:22:04,027;00:22:05,694;right out of them.
206;00:22:05,778;00:22:08,069;That was Ser Jaime's doing,
206;00:22:05,778;00:22:08,069;not hers.
207;00:22:08,152;00:22:10,027;When Queen Cersei
207;00:22:08,152;00:22:10,027;wants something,
208;00:22:10,110;00:22:11,903;she pays in advance and in gold.
209;00:22:11,985;00:22:13,736;Several chests of it, in fact.
210;00:22:13,819;00:22:17,027;Waiting for you
210;00:22:13,819;00:22:17,027;in a wagon just outside.
211;00:22:21,611;00:22:26,444;So she wants to murder someone,
211;00:22:21,611;00:22:26,444;but she can't send her soldiers.
212;00:22:26,527;00:22:28,611;If it's the Dragon Queen
212;00:22:26,527;00:22:28,611;she's after...
213;00:22:28,694;00:22:30,778;She has other plans
213;00:22:28,694;00:22:30,778;for the Targaryen girl.
214;00:22:30,861;00:22:32,944;Yeah, well, good luck with that.
215;00:22:33,027;00:22:34,861;Our queen's brothers
215;00:22:33,027;00:22:34,861;are unlikely
216;00:22:34,944;00:22:37,277;to survive
216;00:22:34,944;00:22:37,277;their Northern adventures.
217;00:22:37,361;00:22:39,694;But in the event that they do...
218;00:22:46,235;00:22:49,903;She has a keen sense
218;00:22:46,235;00:22:49,903;of poetic justice.
219;00:22:51,152;00:22:52,985;That fucking family.
220;00:22:53,069;00:22:54,819;When the Citadel expelled me,
221;00:22:54,903;00:22:56,736;I thought I would die
221;00:22:54,903;00:22:56,736;poor and alone,
222;00:22:56,819;00:23:00,819;but in exchange for my service,
222;00:22:56,819;00:23:00,819;Queen Cersei made me her Hand.
223;00:23:00,903;00:23:02,778;What would she do for the man
224;00:23:02,861;00:23:05,235;who rids her
224;00:23:02,861;00:23:05,235;of her treasonous brothers?
225;00:23:21,361;00:23:23,736;I wanted those elephants.
226;00:23:29,819;00:23:30,819;So...
227;00:23:32,611;00:23:36,611;how do I compare
227;00:23:32,611;00:23:36,611;to the fat king?
228;00:23:37,611;00:23:39,444;You're insulting
228;00:23:37,611;00:23:39,444;my late husband?
229;00:23:39,527;00:23:40,778;Are you offended?
230;00:23:45,361;00:23:48,027;Robert had a different whore
230;00:23:45,361;00:23:48,027;every night,
231;00:23:48,110;00:23:51,110;but he still didn't know
231;00:23:48,110;00:23:51,110;his way around a woman's body.
232;00:23:52,069;00:23:53,152;And the Kingslayer?
233;00:23:58,736;00:24:00,778;You enjoy risking your neck,
233;00:23:58,736;00:24:00,778;don't you?
234;00:24:02,444;00:24:03,611;Life is boring.
235;00:24:03,694;00:24:06,819;You're not boring,
235;00:24:03,694;00:24:06,819;I'll give you that.
236;00:24:18,819;00:24:20,778;Do I please the queen?
237;00:24:22,235;00:24:25,611;You might be the most
237;00:24:22,235;00:24:25,611;arrogant man I've ever met.
238;00:24:27,778;00:24:29,152;I like that.
239;00:24:31,027;00:24:33,486;But now I want to be alone.
240;00:24:39,944;00:24:42,778;I'm going to put a prince in your belly.
241;00:26:17,069;00:26:19,694;Euron can't defend the Iron Islands,
242;00:26:19,778;00:26:23,277;not if he's in King's Landing
242;00:26:19,778;00:26:23,277;with all his men and his ships.
243;00:26:24,402;00:26:26,027;We can take our home back.
244;00:26:26,110;00:26:27,611;Daenerys went north.
245;00:26:27,694;00:26:29,611;Daenerys will need
245;00:26:27,694;00:26:29,611;somewhere to retreat
246;00:26:29,694;00:26:31,235;if they can't hold the North.
247;00:26:31,319;00:26:34,069;Somewhere the dead can't go.
248;00:26:39,361;00:26:42,611;You're my queen.
248;00:26:39,361;00:26:42,611;I go where you command.
249;00:26:47,527;00:26:49,527;You want to go to Winterfell.
250;00:26:49,611;00:26:51,110;To fight for the Starks.
251;00:26:54,985;00:26:55,985;Go.
252;00:27:00,778;00:27:02,861;What is dead may never die.
253;00:27:06,361;00:27:08,319;What is dead may never die.
254;00:27:13,027;00:27:15,277;But kill the bastards anyway.
255;00:27:43,069;00:27:44,736;Welcome back, my lady.
256;00:27:46,027;00:27:47,444;If you'd follow me...
257;00:27:47,527;00:27:48,736;The Karstarks.
258;00:27:48,819;00:27:50,985;One of the better sigils.
259;00:27:52,152;00:27:53,527;Beats an onion, anyway.
260;00:27:55,027;00:27:56,611;Can't argue with that.
261;00:27:56,694;00:27:58,819;Not so long ago,
261;00:27:56,694;00:27:58,819;the Starks and the Karstarks
262;00:27:58,903;00:28:01,277;were slaughtering each other
262;00:27:58,903;00:28:01,277;on the battlefield.
263;00:28:01,361;00:28:03,361;Jon Snow brought peace
263;00:28:01,361;00:28:03,361;to the houses.
264;00:28:03,444;00:28:05,402;And our queen is grateful.
265;00:28:05,486;00:28:08,736;Her gratitude is lovely,
265;00:28:05,486;00:28:08,736;but that's not my point.
266;00:28:08,819;00:28:11,861;The Northmen are loyal
266;00:28:08,819;00:28:11,861;to Jon Snow, not to her.
267;00:28:11,944;00:28:13,027;They don't know her.
268;00:28:13,110;00:28:15,444;The Free Folk don't know her.
269;00:28:15,527;00:28:18,361;I've been up here a while,
269;00:28:15,527;00:28:18,361;and I'm telling you,
270;00:28:18,444;00:28:20,277;they're stubborn as goats.
271;00:28:20,361;00:28:22,985;You want their loyalty,
271;00:28:20,361;00:28:22,985;you have to earn it.
272;00:28:34,402;00:28:36,903;I sense that you're leading
272;00:28:34,402;00:28:36,903;to a proposal.
273;00:28:38,069;00:28:40,694;A proposal
273;00:28:38,069;00:28:40,694;is what I'm proposing.
274;00:28:40,778;00:28:44,152;On the off chance
274;00:28:40,778;00:28:44,152;that we survive the Night King,
275;00:28:44,235;00:28:45,778;what if the Seven Kingdoms,
276;00:28:45,861;00:28:48,277;for once
276;00:28:45,861;00:28:48,277;in their whole shit history,
277;00:28:48,361;00:28:51,903;were ruled by a just woman
277;00:28:48,361;00:28:51,903;and an honorable man?
278;00:28:54,361;00:28:56,194;They do make a handsome couple.
279;00:28:56,277;00:28:58,027;You overestimate our influence.
280;00:28:58,110;00:29:01,486;Jon and Daenerys don't want
280;00:28:58,110;00:29:01,486;to listen to lonely old men.
281;00:29:01,569;00:29:03,277;I'm not that old.
282;00:29:04,569;00:29:05,985;Not as old as him.
283;00:29:07,778;00:29:10,152;Our queen
283;00:29:07,778;00:29:10,152;respects the wisdom of age.
284;00:29:10,235;00:29:11,611;Of course she does.
285;00:29:11,694;00:29:14,444;Respect is how the young
285;00:29:11,694;00:29:14,444;keep us at a distance,
286;00:29:14,527;00:29:18,027;so we don't remind them
286;00:29:14,527;00:29:18,027;of an unpleasant truth.
287;00:29:18,110;00:29:19,319;What is that?
288;00:29:20,444;00:29:21,819;Nothing lasts.
289;00:29:23,361;00:29:24,444;Hey!
290;00:29:30,819;00:29:33,277;Your sister doesn't like me.
291;00:29:37,819;00:29:39,069;She doesn't know you.
292;00:29:40,985;00:29:42,444;If it makes you feel any better,
293;00:29:42,527;00:29:44,337;she didn't like me either
293;00:29:42,527;00:29:44,337;when we were growing up.
294;00:29:44,361;00:29:46,486;She doesn't need
294;00:29:44,361;00:29:46,486;to be my friend...
295;00:29:48,069;00:29:49,985;but I am her queen.
296;00:29:53,486;00:29:55,444;If she can't respect me...
297;00:30:14,319;00:30:15,569;What's the matter?
298;00:30:15,653;00:30:18,152;The dragons are barely eating.
299;00:30:35,527;00:30:36,819;What's wrong with them?
300;00:30:36,903;00:30:38,486;They don't like the North.
301;00:30:54,736;00:30:55,861;Go on.
302;00:31:01,861;00:31:04,319;I don't know
302;00:31:01,861;00:31:04,319;how to ride a dragon.
303;00:31:04,402;00:31:06,903;Nobody does.
303;00:31:04,402;00:31:06,903;Until they ride a dragon.
304;00:31:09,402;00:31:10,903;What if he doesn't want me to?
305;00:31:10,985;00:31:13,903;Then I've enjoyed your company,
305;00:31:10,985;00:31:13,903;Jon Snow.
306;00:31:33,402;00:31:35,027;What do I hold onto?
307;00:31:36,486;00:31:37,861;Whatever you can.
308;00:32:54,778;00:32:55,778;Aah!
309;00:33:34,319;00:33:36,653;You've completely
309;00:33:34,319;00:33:36,653;ruined horses for me.
310;00:33:45,736;00:33:47,861;We could stay
310;00:33:45,736;00:33:47,861;a thousand years...
311;00:33:50,027;00:33:51,361;no one would find us.
312;00:33:53,903;00:33:55,235;We'd be pretty old.
313;00:34:03,402;00:34:06,444;It's cold up here
313;00:34:03,402;00:34:06,444;for a southern girl.
314;00:34:06,527;00:34:08,235;So keep your queen warm.
315;00:34:22,944;00:34:24,069;Don't be afraid.
316;00:34:37,611;00:34:38,778;That's good.
317;00:34:47,736;00:34:49,486;Gendry?
317;00:34:47,736;00:34:49,486;He's here.
318;00:34:55,611;00:34:58,486;It isn't easy making a blade
318;00:34:55,611;00:34:58,486;that big with dragonglass.
319;00:35:00,653;00:35:02,944;You're saying you're good,
319;00:35:00,653;00:35:02,944;is that it?
320;00:35:03,027;00:35:05,027;I'm just saying
320;00:35:03,027;00:35:05,027;it's a tricky material to...
321;00:35:05,110;00:35:08,152;You know who makes weapons
321;00:35:05,110;00:35:08,152;for the wildlings?
322;00:35:08,235;00:35:10,611;Cripples and cocksuckers.
323;00:35:10,694;00:35:13,277;Which one are you?
323;00:35:10,694;00:35:13,277;Leave him be.
324;00:35:20,486;00:35:22,069;I heard you were here.
325;00:35:24,653;00:35:26,110;You left me to die.
326;00:35:27,152;00:35:28,819;First I robbed you.
327;00:35:40,277;00:35:42,611;You're a cold little bitch,
327;00:35:40,277;00:35:42,611;aren't you?
328;00:35:46,152;00:35:48,361;Guess that's why
328;00:35:46,152;00:35:48,361;you're still alive.
329;00:35:56,069;00:35:58,653;That was a nice ax
329;00:35:56,069;00:35:58,653;you made for him.
330;00:35:58,736;00:35:59,944;You've gotten better.
331;00:36:00,027;00:36:02,486;Yeah, thanks. So have you.
332;00:36:03,694;00:36:06,027;I mean, you look good.
333;00:36:07,527;00:36:09,527;Thanks. So do you.
334;00:36:13,194;00:36:16,027;It's not a bad place to grow up,
334;00:36:13,194;00:36:16,027;if it wasn't so cold.
335;00:36:17,361;00:36:19,069;Stay close to that forge, then.
336;00:36:19,152;00:36:22,778;Is that a command, Lady Stark?
336;00:36:19,152;00:36:22,778;Don't call me that.
337;00:36:22,861;00:36:25,027;As you wish, milady.
338;00:36:32,319;00:36:33,527;Here's my wish.
339;00:36:35,861;00:36:36,985;Can you make it?
340;00:36:37,069;00:36:39,235;What do you need
340;00:36:37,069;00:36:39,235;something like this for?
341;00:36:39,319;00:36:40,569;Can you make it or not?
342;00:36:40,653;00:36:43,527;You already have a sword.
342;00:36:40,653;00:36:43,527;What's that?
343;00:36:50,152;00:36:51,486;It's Valyrian steel.
344;00:36:51,569;00:36:53,944;I always knew
344;00:36:51,569;00:36:53,944;you were just another rich girl.
345;00:36:55,903;00:36:58,444;You don't know
345;00:36:55,903;00:36:58,444;any other rich girls.
346;00:37:08,944;00:37:09,944;Come in.
347;00:37:17,486;00:37:19,235;Lord Glover wishes us
347;00:37:17,486;00:37:19,235;good fortune,
348;00:37:19,319;00:37:22,653;but he's staying
348;00:37:19,319;00:37:22,653;in Deepwood Motte with his men.
349;00:37:25,235;00:37:27,486;House Glover will stand
349;00:37:25,235;00:37:27,486;behind House Stark
350;00:37:27,569;00:37:29,944;as we have
350;00:37:27,569;00:37:29,944;for a thousand years.
351;00:37:31,110;00:37:32,402;Isn't that what he said?
352;00:37:32,486;00:37:35,402;I will stand behind Jon Snow,
352;00:37:32,486;00:37:35,402;he said.
353;00:37:36,944;00:37:38,277;The King in the North.
354;00:37:39,402;00:37:41,152;I told you we needed allies.
355;00:37:41,235;00:37:44,486;You didn't tell me you were
355;00:37:41,235;00:37:44,486;going to abandon your crown.
356;00:37:44,569;00:37:46,694;I never wanted a crown.
357;00:37:46,778;00:37:49,527;All I wanted
357;00:37:46,778;00:37:49,527;was to protect the North.
358;00:37:49,611;00:37:52,361;I brought two armies
358;00:37:49,611;00:37:52,361;home with me, two dragons.
359;00:37:52,444;00:37:54,110;And a Targaryen queen.
360;00:37:54,194;00:37:55,569;Do you think
361;00:37:55,653;00:37:57,861;we can beat the Army of the Dead
361;00:37:55,653;00:37:57,861;without her?
362;00:37:57,944;00:38:00,903;I fought them, Sansa. Twice.
363;00:38:00,985;00:38:03,194;You want to worry about
363;00:38:00,985;00:38:03,194;who holds what title,
364;00:38:03,277;00:38:05,736;I'm telling you
364;00:38:03,277;00:38:05,736;it doesn't matter.
365;00:38:05,819;00:38:08,486;Without her,
365;00:38:05,819;00:38:08,486;we don't stand a chance.
366;00:38:17,402;00:38:19,985;Do you have
366;00:38:17,402;00:38:19,985;any faith in me at all?
367;00:38:21,569;00:38:22,861;You know I do.
368;00:38:27,319;00:38:28,944;She'll be a good queen.
369;00:38:30,027;00:38:31,110;For all of us.
370;00:38:32,778;00:38:34,277;She's not her father.
371;00:38:40,819;00:38:42,486;No, she's much prettier.
372;00:38:47,985;00:38:50,444;Did you bend the knee
372;00:38:47,985;00:38:50,444;to save the North
373;00:38:50,527;00:38:52,027;or because you love her?
374;00:39:16,027;00:39:17,319;Oh!
375;00:39:20,736;00:39:21,985;So you're the man?
376;00:39:22,069;00:39:23,527;Um...
377;00:39:23,611;00:39:25,653;Which man am I, Your Grace?
378;00:39:25,736;00:39:28,985;The one who saved Ser Jorah
378;00:39:25,736;00:39:28,985;when no one else could.
379;00:39:29,069;00:39:31,235;They could, they just wouldn't.
380;00:39:32,569;00:39:34,486;I'll have to make some changes
381;00:39:34,569;00:39:36,319;in the Citadel
381;00:39:34,569;00:39:36,319;when I take my throne.
382;00:39:36,402;00:39:38,985;A great service
382;00:39:36,402;00:39:38,985;merits a great reward.
383;00:39:39,069;00:39:41,736;Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace.
384;00:39:41,819;00:39:44,861;Well, there must be something
384;00:39:41,819;00:39:44,861;I could give you.
385;00:39:46,235;00:39:48,985;If it's not too much trouble,
386;00:39:49,069;00:39:51,486;I could use a pardon.
387;00:39:51,569;00:39:52,819;For what crime?
388;00:39:52,903;00:39:54,069;Um...
389;00:39:54,152;00:39:56,903;I borrowed a few books
389;00:39:54,152;00:39:56,903;from the Citadel.
390;00:39:59,277;00:40:01,319;And also a sword.
391;00:40:01,402;00:40:03,861;From the Citadel?
391;00:40:01,402;00:40:03,861;From my family.
392;00:40:05,402;00:40:07,277;It's been in House Tarly
392;00:40:05,402;00:40:07,277;for generations.
393;00:40:07,361;00:40:10,444;It would've been mine
393;00:40:07,361;00:40:10,444;anyway, eventually,
394;00:40:10,527;00:40:13,486;but my father had other ideas.
395;00:40:15,861;00:40:17,235;Not Randyll Tarly?
396;00:40:19,194;00:40:20,611;You know him?
397;00:40:24,486;00:40:27,194;I offered to let him
397;00:40:24,486;00:40:27,194;retain his lands and titles
398;00:40:27,277;00:40:28,361;if he bent the knee.
399;00:40:31,444;00:40:32,569;He refused.
400;00:40:42,277;00:40:43,611;Well...
401;00:40:45,778;00:40:47,694;At least I'll be
401;00:40:45,778;00:40:47,694;allowed home again,
402;00:40:47,778;00:40:49,444;now that my brother's the lord.
403;00:40:53,486;00:40:55,944;Your brother
403;00:40:53,486;00:40:55,944;stood with your father.
404;00:41:10,361;00:41:11,486;Hm.
405;00:41:12,985;00:41:14,903;Thank you, Your Grace.
406;00:41:14,985;00:41:16,402;For telling me.
407;00:41:16,486;00:41:18,235;And m...
408;00:41:18,319;00:41:20,861;May I...?
408;00:41:18,319;00:41:20,861;Of course.
409;00:42:03,653;00:42:05,527;What are you doing out here?
410;00:42:06,736;00:42:09,027;Waiting, for an old friend.
411;00:42:10,361;00:42:12,444;It's time to tell Jon the truth.
412;00:42:13,486;00:42:15,486;No, no.
413;00:42:15,569;00:42:19,444;You're his brother.
413;00:42:15,569;00:42:19,444;Shouldn't you tell him?
414;00:42:19,527;00:42:21,653;I'm not his brother.
415;00:42:21,736;00:42:24,027;He trusts you more than anyone.
416;00:42:25,069;00:42:27,069;Now's the time.
417;00:43:02,152;00:43:03,611;Sam?
418;00:43:03,694;00:43:07,486;I'm sorry, I know I'm not
418;00:43:03,694;00:43:07,486;supposed to be down here.
419;00:43:10,736;00:43:13,110;Were you hiding from me?
419;00:43:10,736;00:43:13,110;Of course not.
420;00:43:14,277;00:43:16,361;What are you doing
420;00:43:14,277;00:43:16,361;in Winterfell?
421;00:43:16,444;00:43:19,110;Or did you read every book
421;00:43:16,444;00:43:19,110;in the Citadel already?
422;00:43:22,611;00:43:24,319;What's wrong?
423;00:43:24,402;00:43:25,861;Gilly? Is she all right?
424;00:43:25,944;00:43:27,778;She's good.
424;00:43:25,944;00:43:27,778;Little Sam?
425;00:43:29,903;00:43:30,903;Don't you know?
426;00:43:32,277;00:43:33,402;Know what?
427;00:43:34,819;00:43:35,819;Daenerys...
428;00:43:36,985;00:43:40,152;she executed my father
428;00:43:36,985;00:43:40,152;and brother.
429;00:43:40,235;00:43:41,819;They were her prisoners.
430;00:43:45,778;00:43:47,819;She didn't tell you.
431;00:43:56,194;00:43:57,486;I'm so sorry.
432;00:44:00,985;00:44:02,694;We need to end this war.
433;00:44:04,444;00:44:06,027;Would you have done it?
434;00:44:08,110;00:44:10,069;Well, I've executed men
434;00:44:08,110;00:44:10,069;who disobeyed me.
435;00:44:10,152;00:44:11,861;You've also spared men.
436;00:44:11,944;00:44:14,527;Thousands of wildlings
436;00:44:11,944;00:44:14,527;when they refused to kneel.
437;00:44:14,611;00:44:16,069;I wasn't a king.
438;00:44:18,444;00:44:19,486;But you were.
439;00:44:21,194;00:44:22,527;You've always been.
440;00:44:24,486;00:44:26,194;I gave up my crown, Sam.
441;00:44:26,985;00:44:27,985;I bent the knee.
442;00:44:28,069;00:44:29,611;I'm not
442;00:44:28,069;00:44:29,611;King in the North anymore.
443;00:44:29,694;00:44:31,337;I'm not talking about
443;00:44:29,694;00:44:31,337;the King in the North.
444;00:44:31,361;00:44:34,611;I'm talking about the King
444;00:44:31,361;00:44:34,611;of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.
445;00:44:42,194;00:44:43,903;Bran and I worked it out.
446;00:44:43,985;00:44:46,819;I had a High Septon's diary.
446;00:44:43,985;00:44:46,819;Bran had...
447;00:44:47,944;00:44:49,277;whatever Bran has.
448;00:44:49,361;00:44:51,319;What are you talking about?
449;00:44:54,444;00:44:55,486;Your mother...
450;00:44:56,653;00:44:57,985;was Lyanna Stark.
451;00:44:59,569;00:45:00,903;And your father...
452;00:45:02,194;00:45:04,152;your real father
453;00:45:04,235;00:45:05,903;was Rhaegar Targaryen.
454;00:45:08,069;00:45:10,694;You've never been a bastard.
455;00:45:10,778;00:45:14,527;You're Aegon Targaryen,
455;00:45:10,778;00:45:14,527;true heir to the Iron Throne.
456;00:45:18,778;00:45:21,569;I'm sorry,
456;00:45:18,778;00:45:21,569;I know it's a lot to take in.
457;00:45:30,778;00:45:34,110;My father was the most
457;00:45:30,778;00:45:34,110;honorable man I ever met.
458;00:45:37,653;00:45:39,736;You're saying
458;00:45:37,653;00:45:39,736;he lied to me all my life.
459;00:45:39,819;00:45:40,944;No.
460;00:45:41,944;00:45:45,444;Your father... Well, Ned Stark.
461;00:45:45,527;00:45:48,903;He promised your mother
461;00:45:45,527;00:45:48,903;he'd always protect you.
462;00:45:48,985;00:45:51,778;And he did. Robert would have
462;00:45:48,985;00:45:51,778;murdered you if he knew.
463;00:45:53,778;00:45:55,277;You're the true king.
464;00:45:56,444;00:45:58,319;Aegon Targaryen,
464;00:45:56,444;00:45:58,319;Sixth of His Name,
465;00:45:58,402;00:46:00,402;Protector of the Realm,
465;00:45:58,402;00:46:00,402;all of it.
466;00:46:14,944;00:46:17,903;Daenerys is our queen.
466;00:46:14,944;00:46:17,903;She shouldn't be.
467;00:46:19,819;00:46:21,819;That's treason.
467;00:46:19,819;00:46:21,819;It's the truth.
468;00:46:23,569;00:46:26,152;You gave up your crown
468;00:46:23,569;00:46:26,152;to save your people.
469;00:46:27,819;00:46:29,486;Would she do the same?
470;00:48:37,694;00:48:39,361;Stay back, he's got blue eyes!
471;00:48:39,444;00:48:41,069;I've always had blue eyes!
472;00:48:51,110;00:48:52,277;Did you find anyone?
473;00:49:25,653;00:49:27,819;The Umber boy.
474;00:49:27,903;00:49:29,027;It's a message.
475;00:49:30,152;00:49:31,736;From the Night King.
476;00:49:31,819;00:49:35,486;His army's between us
476;00:49:31,819;00:49:35,486;and Winterfell. We're on foot.
477;00:49:35,569;00:49:37,402;We rode down from Castle Black.
478;00:49:37,486;00:49:39,736;We can double up on the horses.
479;00:49:39,819;00:49:43,736;If the horses last,
479;00:49:39,819;00:49:43,736;we'll get there before the dead.
480;00:49:43,819;00:49:44,944;We just have to hope
481;00:49:45,027;00:49:46,736;the Night King
481;00:49:45,027;00:49:46,736;doesn't come first.
482;00:50:38,402;00:50:40,944;Keep moving! Straight up!
483;00:50:42,819;00:50:45,736;Stay together!
483;00:50:42,819;00:50:45,736;Don't fall behind!
