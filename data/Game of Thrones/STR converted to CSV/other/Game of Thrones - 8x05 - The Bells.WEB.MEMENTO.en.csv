1;00:00:03,424;00:00:05,174;We have won the Great War.
2;00:00:06,299;00:00:07,757;Now we will win the last war.
3;00:00:08,133;00:00:10,257;The objective here is to remove Cersei
4;00:00:10,340;00:00:12,215;without destroying King's Landing.
5;00:00:14,549;00:00:16,174;You heading to King's Landing?
6;00:00:16,382;00:00:18,215;There's some unfinished business.
7;00:00:18,507;00:00:19,424;Me too.
8;00:00:19,674;00:00:21,507;I don't plan on coming back.
9;00:00:22,340;00:00:23,674;Neither do I.
10;00:00:25,299;00:00:28,549;I always wanted to be there
10;00:00:25,299;00:00:28,549;when they execute your sister.
11;00:00:29,507;00:00:31,174;Seems like I won't get the chance.
12;00:00:32,424;00:00:33,966;Stay with me.
13;00:00:35,174;00:00:36,340;Please.
14;00:00:36,757;00:00:38,174;Cersei's hateful...
15;00:00:40,674;00:00:41,716;And so am I.
16;00:00:50,591;00:00:52,049;I need to tell you something.
17;00:00:54,549;00:00:57,507;But you have to swear
17;00:00:54,549;00:00:57,507;you'll never tell another soul.
18;00:00:57,591;00:01:00,674;What if there's someone else?
18;00:00:57,591;00:01:00,674;Someone better.
19;00:01:01,133;00:01:03,883;At a certain point, you choose
19;00:01:01,133;00:01:03,883;a person you believe in,
20;00:01:03,966;00:01:05,299;and you fight for that person.
21;00:01:05,382;00:01:07,591;Even if you know it's a mistake?
22;00:01:10,382;00:01:11,883;He has the better claim to the throne.
23;00:01:11,966;00:01:13,507;Every time a Targaryen is born,
24;00:01:13,591;00:01:14,591;the gods flip a coin.
25;00:01:15,008;00:01:16,591;The Mad King
25;00:01:15,008;00:01:16,591;gave his enemies the justice
26;00:01:16,674;00:01:17,716;he thought they deserved.
27;00:01:17,799;00:01:18,966;Children are not their fathers.
28;00:01:19,591;00:01:21,133;Be a dragon.
28;00:01:19,591;00:01:21,133;You have a gentle heart.
29;00:01:21,215;00:01:23,632;A Targaryen alone in the world
30;00:01:23,716;00:01:24,924;is a terrible thing.
31;00:01:25,257;00:01:27,049;You don't
31;00:01:25,257;00:01:27,049;want to awake the dragon, do you?

36;00:04:06,008;00:04:07,632;She won't eat.

40;00:04:23,632;00:04:27,591;Of course they are.
40;00:04:23,632;00:04:27,591;That's their job.

47;00:05:19,174;00:05:20,674;How is she?
48;00:05:20,757;00:05:23,382;She hasn't seen anyone
48;00:05:20,757;00:05:23,382;since we returned.
49;00:05:23,465;00:05:26,799;Hasn't left her chambers,

51;00:05:29,799;00:05:32,883;You're worried for her.
51;00:05:29,799;00:05:32,883;I admire your empathy.
52;00:05:32,966;00:05:34,841;Aren't you worried for her?
53;00:05:34,924;00:05:37,049;I'm worried for all of us.
54;00:05:37,133;00:05:39,299;They say every time
54;00:05:37,133;00:05:39,299;a Targaryen is born,
55;00:05:39,382;00:05:42,591;the gods toss a coin
55;00:05:39,382;00:05:42,591;and the world holds its breath.
56;00:05:42,674;00:05:45,424;We're not much for riddles
56;00:05:42,674;00:05:45,424;where I'm from.
57;00:05:45,507;00:05:48,340;We both know what she's about to do.
58;00:05:54,215;00:05:56,340;That's her decision to make.
58;00:05:54,215;00:05:56,340;She is our queen.
59;00:05:56,424;00:06:00,549;Men decide where power resides,

60;00:06:03,091;00:06:04,883;What do you want?
61;00:06:04,966;00:06:06,716;All I've ever wanted.
62;00:06:06,799;00:06:09,716;The right ruler on the Iron Throne.
63;00:06:11,257;00:06:14,091;I still don't know
63;00:06:11,257;00:06:14,091;how her coin has landed.
64;00:06:14,174;00:06:17,507;But I'm quite certain about yours.
65;00:06:25,549;00:06:27,465;I don't want it.
66;00:06:27,549;00:06:28,883;I never have.
67;00:06:31,340;00:06:35,049;I have known more kings
67;00:06:31,340;00:06:35,049;and queens than any man living.
68;00:06:35,133;00:06:36,799;I've heard what they say to crowds,
69;00:06:36,883;00:06:38,716;and seen what they do in the shadows.
70;00:06:38,799;00:06:42,174;I have furthered their designs,
70;00:06:38,799;00:06:42,174;however horrible.
71;00:06:42,257;00:06:44,966;But what I tell you now is true:
72;00:06:45,049;00:06:48,257;You will rule wisely and well,
72;00:06:45,049;00:06:48,257;while she--
73;00:06:48,340;00:06:50,133;She...
74;00:06:50,215;00:06:51,299;is my queen.
75;00:07:13,133;00:07:14,591;Your Grace?
76;00:07:39,799;00:07:42,257;There's something you need to know.
77;00:07:43,549;00:07:45,799;Someone has betrayed me.
78;00:07:51,966;00:07:53,340;Yes.
79;00:07:57,299;00:07:59,091;Jon Snow.
80;00:08:04,966;00:08:05,924;Varys.
81;00:08:08,133;00:08:10,257;He knows the truth about Jon.
82;00:08:11,549;00:08:13,091;He does.
83;00:08:17,841;00:08:20,174;Because you told him.
84;00:08:22,465;00:08:24,215;You learned from Sansa.
85;00:08:25,174;00:08:26,841;And she learned from Jon,
86;00:08:26,924;00:08:29,507;though I begged him not to tell her.
87;00:08:30,883;00:08:32,716;As I said...
88;00:08:33,465;00:08:34,549;he betrayed me.
89;00:08:34,632;00:08:36,465;I'm glad Sansa told me.
90;00:08:36,549;00:08:38,091;I am your Hand.
91;00:08:38,174;00:08:40,674;I need to be aware
91;00:08:38,174;00:08:40,674;of any threats you're facing.
92;00:08:42,174;00:08:43,465;And Varys?
93;00:08:43,549;00:08:46,674;Your Master of Whisperers
93;00:08:43,549;00:08:46,674;needs to be aware too.
94;00:08:47,507;00:08:49,924;You spoke to him first.
95;00:08:50,008;00:08:51,257;Without coming to me.
96;00:08:51,340;00:08:53,799;Without asking my permission.
97;00:08:55,424;00:08:58,049;It was a mistake.
98;00:09:00,049;00:09:02,841;Why do you think Sansa told you?
99;00:09:02,924;00:09:04,632;What do you think she hoped to gain?
100;00:09:04,716;00:09:08,340;She trusts me.
100;00:09:04,716;00:09:08,340;Yes, she trusts you.
101;00:09:09,465;00:09:13,549;She trusted you to spread secrets
102;00:09:13,632;00:09:16,716;that could destroy your own queen.
103;00:09:18,716;00:09:21,008;And you did not let her down.
104;00:09:24,674;00:09:28,215;If I have failed you, my queen,
104;00:09:24,674;00:09:28,215;forgive me.
105;00:09:30,091;00:09:32,382;Our intentions were good.
106;00:09:33,799;00:09:37,382;We wanted what you want.
106;00:09:33,799;00:09:37,382;A better world, all of us.
107;00:09:38,632;00:09:41,465;Varys as much as anyone.
108;00:09:50,174;00:09:52,299;But it doesn't matter now.
109;00:09:54,465;00:09:55,424;No.
110;00:09:56,757;00:09:58,424;It doesn't matter now.
111;00:11:58,883;00:12:00,841;It was me.
112;00:12:06,215;00:12:07,841;I hope I deserve this.
113;00:12:07,924;00:12:09,591;Truly, I do.
114;00:12:09,674;00:12:11,757;I hope I'm wrong.
115;00:12:19,299;00:12:20,382;Goodbye, old friend.
116;00:13:01,883;00:13:02,966;Lord Varys.
117;00:13:04,716;00:13:06,883;I, Daenerys of House Targaryen,
118;00:13:06,966;00:13:08,799;First of My Name,
119;00:13:08,883;00:13:12,133;Breaker of Chains
119;00:13:08,883;00:13:12,133;and Mother of Dragons...
120;00:13:13,966;00:13:16,008;sentence you to die.
121;00:13:26,507;00:13:27,632;Dracarys.
122;00:14:18,799;00:14:20,382;This was all she brought with her
123;00:14:20,465;00:14:22,382;when we crossed the Narrow Sea.
124;00:14:23,465;00:14:25,507;Her only possession.
125;00:15:10,215;00:15:12,424;_
126;00:15:12,544;00:15:13,906;_
127;00:15:41,215;00:15:43,841;What did I say would
127;00:15:41,215;00:15:43,841;happen if you told your sister?
128;00:15:43,924;00:15:47,215;I don't want it,
128;00:15:43,924;00:15:47,215;and that's what I told him.
129;00:15:48,507;00:15:50,716;She betrayed your trust.
130;00:15:50,799;00:15:52,549;She killed Varys as much as I did.
131;00:15:54,174;00:15:56,632;This was a victory for her.
132;00:15:58,133;00:15:59,340;Now she knows what happens
133;00:15:59,424;00:16:01,340;when people hear the truth about you.
134;00:16:03,966;00:16:07,966;Far more people in Westeros
134;00:16:03,966;00:16:07,966;love you than love me.
135;00:16:10,465;00:16:12,841;I don't have love here.
136;00:16:14,299;00:16:16,340;I only have fear.
137;00:16:19,257;00:16:21,133;I love you.
138;00:16:23,674;00:16:26,465;And you will always be my queen.
139;00:16:33,299;00:16:35,299;Is that all I am to you?
140;00:16:37,049;00:16:39,008;Your queen?
141;00:17:15,883;00:17:17,841;All right, then.
142;00:17:25,215;00:17:27,049;Let it be fear.
143;00:17:31,049;00:17:34,299;The people who live
143;00:17:31,049;00:17:34,299;there, they're not your enemies.
144;00:17:34,382;00:17:37,133;They're innocents, like the ones
144;00:17:34,382;00:17:37,133;you liberated in Meereen.
145;00:17:37,215;00:17:39,133;In Meereen,
145;00:17:37,215;00:17:39,133;the slaves turned on the masters
146;00:17:39,215;00:17:42,299;and liberated the city
146;00:17:39,215;00:17:42,299;themselves the moment I arrived.
147;00:17:42,382;00:17:43,591;They're afraid.
148;00:17:43,674;00:17:44,924;Anyone who resists Cersei
149;00:17:45,008;00:17:47,133;will see his family butchered.
150;00:17:47,215;00:17:49,424;You can't expect them to be heroes.
151;00:17:49,507;00:17:51,632;They're hostages.
151;00:17:49,507;00:17:51,632;They are.
152;00:17:51,716;00:17:55,049;In a tyrant's grip.
152;00:17:51,716;00:17:55,049;Whose fault is that? Mine?
153;00:17:55,133;00:17:57,757;What does it matter whose fault it is?
154;00:17:57,841;00:18:00,716;Thousands of children will die
154;00:17:57,841;00:18:00,716;if the city burns.
155;00:18:00,799;00:18:02,049;Your sister knows how to use
156;00:18:02,133;00:18:04,174;her enemies' weaknesses against them.
157;00:18:04,257;00:18:06,674;That's what she thinks our mercy is:
158;00:18:06,757;00:18:07,924;weakness.
159;00:18:08,008;00:18:10,091;I beg you, my queen--
159;00:18:08,008;00:18:10,091;But she's wrong.
160;00:18:10,966;00:18:12,757;Mercy is our strength.
161;00:18:14,008;00:18:16,382;Our mercy towards future generations
162;00:18:16,465;00:18:19,049;who will never again
162;00:18:16,465;00:18:19,049;be held hostage by a tyrant.
163;00:18:25,008;00:18:26,632;Ready the Unsullied.
164;00:18:26,716;00:18:28,257;Tonight you sail for King's Landing
165;00:18:28,340;00:18:30,174;to join the Northern armies.
165;00:18:28,340;00:18:30,174;Cersei's followers
166;00:18:30,257;00:18:32,133;will abandon her
166;00:18:30,257;00:18:32,133;if they know the war is lost.
167;00:18:32,215;00:18:33,382;Give them that chance.
168;00:18:33,465;00:18:35,757;If the city surrenders,
169;00:18:35,841;00:18:37,883;they will ring the bells
169;00:18:35,841;00:18:37,883;and raise the gates.
170;00:18:37,966;00:18:41,632;Please, if you hear them ringing
170;00:18:37,966;00:18:41,632;the bells, call off the attack.
171;00:18:49,799;00:18:51,799;Wait for me outside the city.
172;00:18:52,883;00:18:54,591;You'll know when it's time.
173;00:19:24,133;00:19:28,008;Your brother was stopped
173;00:19:24,133;00:19:28,008;trying to get past our lines.
174;00:19:32,340;00:19:35,841;It seems he hasn't abandoned
174;00:19:32,340;00:19:35,841;your sister after all.
175;00:19:41,549;00:19:43,174;The next time you fail me...
176;00:19:44,549;00:19:47,008;will be the last time you fail me.
177;00:20:03,799;00:20:05,799;Let them pass.
178;00:20:17,215;00:20:18,799;Through the gate.
179;00:20:18,883;00:20:20,215;Get going.
180;00:21:01,799;00:21:04,716;The rearguard
180;00:21:01,799;00:21:04,716;should be here by daybreak.
181;00:21:04,799;00:21:07,257;She wants to attack now.
182;00:21:08,465;00:21:09,924;Daybreak at the earliest.
183;00:21:11,424;00:21:14,591;Careful with that.
183;00:21:11,424;00:21:14,591;My lord.
184;00:21:17,049;00:21:18,257;Davos.
185;00:21:20,841;00:21:23,133;I need to ask you a favor.
186;00:21:25,257;00:21:27,757;You're the greatest smuggler
186;00:21:25,257;00:21:27,757;alive, aren't you?
187;00:21:29,299;00:21:32,674;I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?
188;00:21:32,757;00:21:35,215;He's always better
188;00:21:32,757;00:21:35,215;when he's got some food in him.
189;00:21:35,299;00:21:38,465;Problem is when he's got drink in him.
190;00:21:38,549;00:21:40,008;See what he did the other week?
191;00:21:40,091;00:21:41,674;Aye. Fighting as well.
192;00:21:41,757;00:21:43,133;Commander nearly caught him.
193;00:21:43,215;00:21:46,091;Ay up. Where you going?
194;00:21:47,507;00:21:49,507;I'm Arya Stark.
195;00:21:49,591;00:21:52,133;I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.
196;00:21:56,632;00:21:57,632;Think about it.
197;00:21:57,716;00:22:00,340;She kills Cersei, the war's over.
198;00:22:00,424;00:22:03,799;There won't be a siege.
198;00:22:00,424;00:22:03,799;You might not even die tomorrow.
199;00:22:07,091;00:22:08,924;I need to go talk to my captain.
200;00:22:09,008;00:22:11,008;Go ahead, talk to him.
201;00:22:13,757;00:22:15,465;Where's he going?
202;00:22:29,507;00:22:33,008;_
203;00:22:34,688;00:22:37,579;_
204;00:22:42,125;00:22:45,245;_
205;00:22:45,591;00:22:47,174;We speak the common tongue.
206;00:22:48,174;00:22:50,091;Ah. Good.
207;00:22:50,174;00:22:51,924;I want to be alone with the prisoner.
208;00:22:52,008;00:22:54,174;Get some rest.
208;00:22:52,008;00:22:54,174;Tomorrow will be a long day.
209;00:22:54,257;00:22:56,632;We have orders to guard the prisoner.
210;00:22:56,716;00:22:58,507;Ordered by whom?
210;00:22:56,716;00:22:58,507;The queen herself?
211;00:22:59,716;00:23:01,674;No.
211;00:22:59,716;00:23:01,674;Well, in that case,
212;00:23:01,757;00:23:04,716;as Hand of the Queen, I outrank
212;00:23:01,757;00:23:04,716;whomever gave your order.
213;00:23:04,799;00:23:06,340;Probably by quite a lot.
214;00:23:30,049;00:23:32,049;How did they find you?
215;00:23:40,215;00:23:42,632;Did you consider taking it off?
216;00:23:44,091;00:23:47,549;Cersei once called me
216;00:23:44,091;00:23:47,549;the stupidest Lannister.
217;00:23:49,049;00:23:52,299;And you're going back to her,
217;00:23:49,049;00:23:52,299;to die with her.
218;00:23:53,465;00:23:55,091;You've underestimated her before.
219;00:23:55,174;00:23:56,549;She's going to die.
220;00:23:57,716;00:23:59,133;Unless you can convince her
221;00:23:59,215;00:24:00,841;to change her course of action.
222;00:24:00,924;00:24:02,924;Difficult to do from here.
223;00:24:08,549;00:24:11,674;When have I ever been able
223;00:24:08,549;00:24:11,674;to convince Cersei of anything?
224;00:24:11,757;00:24:13,340;Try.
225;00:24:13,424;00:24:15,382;If not for yourself, if not for her,
226;00:24:15,465;00:24:18,215;then for every one of the
226;00:24:15,465;00:24:18,215;million people in that city,
227;00:24:18,299;00:24:19,632;innocent or otherwise.
228;00:24:19,716;00:24:22,716;To be honest, I never really
228;00:24:19,716;00:24:22,716;cared much for them.
229;00:24:22,799;00:24:24,465;Innocent or otherwise.
230;00:24:25,799;00:24:27,924;You do care for one innocent.
231;00:24:28,841;00:24:30,340;I know you do.
232;00:24:30,424;00:24:32,174;And so does Cersei.
233;00:24:33,465;00:24:35,174;She has a reason now.
234;00:24:36,632;00:24:40,382;The child is the reason
234;00:24:36,632;00:24:40,382;she'll never give an inch.
235;00:24:40,465;00:24:42,257;All the worst things she's ever done,
236;00:24:42,340;00:24:44,716;she's done for her children.
237;00:24:44,799;00:24:46,966;It's not impossible that she'll win.
238;00:24:47,049;00:24:48,257;She won't.
239;00:24:48,340;00:24:50,215;Her enemy's forces have been depleted,
240;00:24:50,299;00:24:51,674;as she said they would be.
241;00:24:51,757;00:24:54,008;Two of the three dragons are dead.
242;00:24:54,091;00:24:56,632;She's evened the odds.
242;00:24:54,091;00:24:56,632;The city will fall tomorrow.
243;00:24:56,716;00:24:58,632;She has the Lannister army,
243;00:24:56,716;00:24:58,632;she has the Golden Company--
244;00:24:58,716;00:25:00,424;I defended the city
244;00:24:58,716;00:25:00,424;last time it was attacked.
245;00:25:00,507;00:25:03,091;I know it better than anyone.
245;00:25:00,507;00:25:03,091;It will fall tomorrow.
246;00:25:03,174;00:25:05,424;Then I suppose I'll die
246;00:25:03,174;00:25:05,424;tomorrow, if not before.
247;00:25:05,507;00:25:07,174;Why?
248;00:25:13,382;00:25:14,883;Escape.
249;00:25:14,966;00:25:16,966;The two of you, together.
250;00:25:17,049;00:25:18,299;Remember where we met,
251;00:25:18,382;00:25:20,049;where they keep the dragon skulls,
252;00:25:20,133;00:25:21,174;beneath the Red Keep?
253;00:25:22,841;00:25:24,133;Take her down there.
254;00:25:24,215;00:25:25,883;Keep following the stairways down,
255;00:25:25,966;00:25:27,340;down as far as they'll go.
256;00:25:27,424;00:25:29,757;You'll come out onto a beach
256;00:25:27,424;00:25:29,757;at the foot of the keep.
257;00:25:29,841;00:25:31,799;A dinghy will be waiting for you.
258;00:25:33,008;00:25:34,382;Sail out of the bay.
259;00:25:34,465;00:25:37,174;If the winds are kind,
259;00:25:34,465;00:25:37,174;you'll make it to Pentos.
260;00:25:38,340;00:25:40,757;Start a new life.
261;00:25:44,091;00:25:47,424;Sail right past the Iron Fleet
261;00:25:44,091;00:25:47,424;and into a new life?
262;00:25:47,507;00:25:50,174;Sounds a lot less likely
262;00:25:47,507;00:25:50,174;than Cersei winning this war--
263;00:25:50,257;00:25:52,883;There won't be an Iron Fleet
263;00:25:50,257;00:25:52,883;for much longer.
264;00:25:54,091;00:25:55,340;Do it.
265;00:25:55,424;00:25:58,549;If you don't,
265;00:25:55,424;00:25:58,549;you'll never see Cersei again.
266;00:26:04,424;00:26:06,215;Swear to me.
267;00:26:09,507;00:26:11,424;You have my word.
268;00:26:16,049;00:26:17,465;If it works,
269;00:26:17,549;00:26:19,215;give the order to ring all the bells
270;00:26:19,299;00:26:21,049;in King's Landing and open the gates.
271;00:26:21,133;00:26:23,924;That will be our signal
271;00:26:21,133;00:26:23,924;that the city has surrendered.
272;00:26:24,008;00:26:25,465;I'll try.
273;00:26:26,883;00:26:29,257;I never thought
273;00:26:26,883;00:26:29,257;I'd get to repay the favor.
274;00:26:29,340;00:26:32,049;Remember, ring the bells
274;00:26:29,340;00:26:32,049;and open the gates.
275;00:26:32,133;00:26:34,674;Your queen will execute you for this.
276;00:26:34,757;00:26:36,507;If Daenerys can make it to the throne
277;00:26:36,591;00:26:38,591;without wading through
277;00:26:36,591;00:26:38,591;a river of blood,
278;00:26:38,674;00:26:39,799;maybe she'll show mercy
279;00:26:39,883;00:26:42,091;to the person who made that possible.
280;00:26:47,841;00:26:50,591;Tens of thousands of innocent lives...
281;00:26:51,883;00:26:55,091;one not particularly innocent dwarf...
282;00:26:56,507;00:26:59,091;it seems like a fair trade.
283;00:27:05,632;00:27:07,632;If it weren't for you,
284;00:27:07,716;00:27:09,883;I never would've survived my childhood.
285;00:27:12,008;00:27:13,841;You would have.
286;00:27:21,465;00:27:23,008;You were the only one
287;00:27:24,215;00:27:27,133;who didn't treat me like a monster.
288;00:27:29,716;00:27:31,966;You were all I had.
289;00:28:42,841;00:28:45,257;Eyes on the horizon!
290;00:28:46,549;00:28:48,549;Load the scorpion!
291;00:29:01,799;00:29:03,215;Archers, close up!
292;00:29:03,299;00:29:04,674;Come on!
293;00:29:04,757;00:29:06,757;Up to the espringal!
294;00:29:06,841;00:29:09,049;To the back of it!
295;00:29:21,008;00:29:22,716;Archers, line up!
296;00:29:30,757;00:29:32,257;This way! Come on!
297;00:29:32,340;00:29:33,924;Clear the streets now!
298;00:29:34,008;00:29:36,257;No!
298;00:29:34,008;00:29:36,257;In, now.
299;00:29:36,340;00:29:39,008;And you, come on.
299;00:29:36,340;00:29:39,008;Inside, now!
300;00:29:39,091;00:29:40,507;Quickly.
301;00:29:40,591;00:29:41,674;Yes. Follow down there.
302;00:29:41,757;00:29:43,549;They're here.
302;00:29:41,757;00:29:43,549;Get to the Red Keep.
303;00:29:45,257;00:29:47,215;My son!
303;00:29:45,257;00:29:47,215;Get inside!
304;00:29:51,549;00:29:53,465;Just ahead of you, I can see it!
305;00:29:53,549;00:29:54,883;All right, move it!
306;00:29:54,966;00:29:56,799;Come on!
306;00:29:54,966;00:29:56,799;Keep moving!
307;00:29:56,883;00:29:58,549;Keep going!
307;00:29:56,883;00:29:58,549;Keep moving!
308;00:29:58,632;00:30:00,382;Quickly!
308;00:29:58,632;00:30:00,382;All the way!
309;00:30:00,465;00:30:02,382;Come on!
309;00:30:00,465;00:30:02,382;Come on!
310;00:30:02,465;00:30:04,591;Hold your mother's hand!
311;00:30:17,340;00:30:21,257;Make way for the Golden Company!
312;00:30:30,299;00:30:31,549;Close the gate!
313;00:31:36,008;00:31:39,049;If you hear the bells ring,
313;00:31:36,008;00:31:39,049;they've surrendered.
314;00:31:39,133;00:31:41,049;Call off your men.
315;00:31:53,382;00:31:55,632;Move along now, lads.
316;00:32:24,382;00:32:26,966;That's it.
316;00:32:24,382;00:32:26,966;Go on, move it.
317;00:32:30,215;00:32:33,465;Come on, move, move.
317;00:32:30,215;00:32:33,465;Faster, faster. Come on, move it.
318;00:32:33,549;00:32:35,382;Keep going.
318;00:32:33,549;00:32:35,382;Keep moving.

408;00:51:21,424;00:51:23,257;Well, maybe for you.
409;00:51:24,549;00:51:27,591;If you kill another king
409;00:51:24,549;00:51:27,591;before you die...
410;00:51:28,799;00:51:30,549;they'll sing about you forever.

423;00:54:33,757;00:54:35,133;for a cripple.
424;00:55:19,465;00:55:20,799;Another king for you.

426;00:55:40,299;00:55:41,340;I got you!
427;00:55:47,841;00:55:50,674;I'm the man who killed Jaime Lannister.

430;00:56:19,008;00:56:20,757;or one of the Dothraki.
431;00:56:22,008;00:56:24,716;Or maybe that dragon will eat her.
432;00:56:24,799;00:56:26,799;It doesn't matter. She's dead.
433;00:56:26,883;00:56:29,674;And you'll be dead too
433;00:56:26,883;00:56:29,674;if you don't get out of here.
434;00:56:30,716;00:56:32,091;I'm going to kill her.
435;00:56:33,632;00:56:36,465;You think you wanted revenge
435;00:56:33,632;00:56:36,465;a long time?
436;00:56:36,549;00:56:38,174;I've been after it all my life.

438;00:56:40,507;00:56:42,883;And look at me. Look at me!
439;00:56:44,883;00:56:47,215;You wanna be like me?
440;00:56:54,049;00:56:58,257;You come with me, you die here.
