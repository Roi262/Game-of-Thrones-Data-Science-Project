14;00:02:47,764;00:02:49,731;I followed him.
15;00:02:49,766;00:02:52,201;He took the baby
15;00:02:49,766;00:02:52,201;into the woods, the newborn.
16;00:02:52,235;00:02:54,169;What business is that
16;00:02:52,235;00:02:54,169;of yours?
17;00:02:54,204;00:02:55,771;No, you don't understand.
18;00:02:55,806;00:02:58,207;He's killing them,
18;00:02:55,806;00:02:58,207;all the boys.
19;00:03:03,415;00:03:05,250;You know.

21;00:03:14,661;00:03:18,230;are Craster's offerings.
22;00:03:18,264;00:03:19,765;Offerings?
23;00:03:19,799;00:03:22,535;He's murdering his own children.
23;00:03:19,799;00:03:22,535;He's a monster.
24;00:03:22,569;00:03:24,604;Aye, many a time that monster
24;00:03:22,569;00:03:24,604;has been the difference
25;00:03:24,638;00:03:27,173;between life and death
25;00:03:24,638;00:03:27,173;for our Rangers.
26;00:03:27,207;00:03:29,542;Your Uncle among them.

28;00:03:33,113;00:03:37,483;we need men like Craster.
29;00:03:42,122;00:03:44,057;I...
30;00:03:44,091;00:03:45,792;I saw it.
31;00:03:48,596;00:03:51,731;I saw...
32;00:03:51,765;00:03:54,601;Something take
32;00:03:51,765;00:03:54,601;that child.
33;00:03:54,635;00:03:56,770;Yeah.
34;00:03:56,804;00:03:58,972;Whatever it was,
35;00:03:59,007;00:04:01,342;I daresay
35;00:03:59,007;00:04:01,342;you'll see it again.
36;00:04:03,812;00:04:06,780;Now ready my horse.
37;00:04:06,815;00:04:09,116;We leave at dawn.
38;00:04:14,089;00:04:16,591;Don't lose it again.
39;00:04:40,417;00:04:42,586;Gilly.
40;00:04:45,023;00:04:47,258;You're leaving.
41;00:04:47,292;00:04:51,662;I-- I wanted
41;00:04:47,292;00:04:51,662;to give you something.
42;00:04:54,900;00:04:57,401;It belonged
42;00:04:54,900;00:04:57,401;to my mother.
43;00:04:58,937;00:05:01,572;I can't take it.
43;00:04:58,937;00:05:01,572;Please.
44;00:05:01,607;00:05:03,407;I want you to.
45;00:05:06,345;00:05:08,946;My mother used it
45;00:05:06,345;00:05:08,946;for sewing.
46;00:05:08,981;00:05:12,149;She'd let me sit with her
46;00:05:08,981;00:05:12,149;in her chamber while she sewed
47;00:05:12,184;00:05:14,952;and I'd read to her.
48;00:05:17,656;00:05:20,124;My father put a stop
48;00:05:17,656;00:05:20,124;to it when he found out.
49;00:05:21,693;00:05:24,829;It's the only thing
49;00:05:21,693;00:05:24,829;I have of hers.
50;00:05:24,863;00:05:27,899;She gave it to me
50;00:05:24,863;00:05:27,899;before I left for the Wall.
51;00:05:27,933;00:05:30,001;You--
52;00:05:30,035;00:05:32,003;you shouldn't
52;00:05:30,035;00:05:32,003;give it away.
53;00:05:32,037;00:05:34,873;I'm not giving it away.
54;00:05:34,907;00:05:37,075;I'm giving it to you.
55;00:05:39,778;00:05:42,113;Keep it safe for me.
56;00:05:42,148;00:05:44,249;Till I come back.
57;00:06:02,235;00:06:03,936;Hodor.
58;00:06:03,970;00:06:06,005;Hodor.
59;00:06:06,039;00:06:09,075;Rouse Bran, will you?
59;00:06:06,039;00:06:09,075;It's time for his lessons.
60;00:06:41,309;00:06:44,211;Every night it's the same.
61;00:06:44,245;00:06:46,547;I'm walking
62;00:06:46,581;00:06:49,149;and running, but...
63;00:06:50,719;00:06:54,022;I'm not--
63;00:06:50,719;00:06:54,022;I'm not me.
64;00:06:54,056;00:06:57,091;I'm running
64;00:06:54,056;00:06:57,091;through the Godswood,
65;00:06:57,126;00:06:59,426;sniffing the dirt,
66;00:06:59,461;00:07:02,796;tasting blood in my mouth when
66;00:06:59,461;00:07:02,796;I've made a fresh kill,
67;00:07:02,831;00:07:05,699;howling.
68;00:07:07,701;00:07:09,869;Old Nan used to
68;00:07:07,701;00:07:09,869;tell me stories
69;00:07:09,903;00:07:11,937;about magical people
69;00:07:09,903;00:07:11,937;who could live
70;00:07:11,972;00:07:16,675;inside stags,
70;00:07:11,972;00:07:16,675;birds, wolves.
71;00:07:16,710;00:07:18,677;That's exactly
71;00:07:16,710;00:07:18,677;what they are, Bran--
72;00:07:18,712;00:07:21,246;stories.
72;00:07:18,712;00:07:21,246;So she was lying?
73;00:07:21,280;00:07:24,549;They don't exist?
73;00:07:21,280;00:07:24,549;Well, they may have done.
74;00:07:24,583;00:07:27,152;But they're gone
74;00:07:24,583;00:07:27,152;from the world
75;00:07:27,186;00:07:29,987;along with much else.
76;00:07:31,256;00:07:33,524;These are dreams, Bran,
77;00:07:33,559;00:07:35,059;nothing more.
78;00:07:35,094;00:07:37,795;No, my dreams
78;00:07:35,094;00:07:37,795;are different.
79;00:07:37,829;00:07:40,031;Mine are true.
80;00:07:40,065;00:07:42,600;I dreamt of my father dying.
81;00:07:42,634;00:07:45,303;And Rickon had
81;00:07:42,634;00:07:45,303;the same dream.
82;00:07:45,337;00:07:48,206;What about all the dreams
82;00:07:45,337;00:07:48,206;you had that didn't come true?
83;00:07:50,009;00:07:52,277;Hmm?
84;00:07:55,715;00:07:57,650;Right.
85;00:07:57,684;00:08:01,721;This link is made
85;00:07:57,684;00:08:01,721;of Valyrian steel.
86;00:08:01,755;00:08:05,691;Only one Maester in 100
86;00:08:01,755;00:08:05,691;wears it on his chain.
87;00:08:05,726;00:08:09,695;It signifies that I have
87;00:08:05,726;00:08:09,695;studied the higher mysteries.
88;00:08:09,730;00:08:13,899;And all who study these mysteries
88;00:08:09,730;00:08:13,899;try their hand at spells.
89;00:08:13,933;00:08:15,835;I was no different.
90;00:08:15,869;00:08:17,937;I was young.
91;00:08:17,971;00:08:22,541;And what boy doesn't secretly
91;00:08:17,971;00:08:22,541;wish for hidden powers
92;00:08:22,576;00:08:26,679;to lift him out of his
92;00:08:22,576;00:08:26,679;dull life into a special one?
93;00:08:26,713;00:08:29,548;But in the end,
93;00:08:26,713;00:08:29,548;for all my efforts,
94;00:08:29,582;00:08:32,818;I got no more out of it
94;00:08:29,582;00:08:32,818;than 1,000 boys before me.
95;00:08:32,852;00:08:35,787;Come on.
96;00:08:44,162;00:08:46,697;All right.
97;00:08:46,731;00:08:50,901;Maybe magic once was
97;00:08:46,731;00:08:50,901;a mighty force in the world.
98;00:08:52,636;00:08:54,771;But not anymore.
99;00:08:56,274;00:08:58,642;The Dragons are gone.
100;00:08:58,676;00:09:01,011;The Giants are dead.
101;00:09:02,547;00:09:05,515;And the Children
101;00:09:02,547;00:09:05,515;of the Forest forgotten.
102;00:09:55,501;00:09:58,636;Loras!
102;00:09:55,501;00:09:58,636;Highgarden!
103;00:10:01,640;00:10:03,675;Get him!
104;00:10:08,280;00:10:10,414;Oh!
105;00:10:11,483;00:10:14,051;Yield!
105;00:10:11,483;00:10:14,051;I yield.
106;00:10:22,461;00:10:25,530;Well fought.
106;00:10:22,461;00:10:25,530;Approach.
107;00:10:35,074;00:10:37,575;Rise.
107;00:10:35,074;00:10:37,575;Remove your helm.
108;00:10:45,685;00:10:48,320;You are all your father
108;00:10:45,685;00:10:48,320;promised and more, My Lady.
109;00:10:48,354;00:10:50,655;I've seen Ser Loras
109;00:10:48,354;00:10:50,655;bested once or twice,
110;00:10:50,689;00:10:52,756;but never quite
110;00:10:50,689;00:10:52,756;in that fashion.
111;00:10:52,791;00:10:56,828;Now, now, my love. My brother
111;00:10:52,791;00:10:56,828;fought valiantly for you.
112;00:10:58,297;00:11:00,532;That he did, my Queen.
113;00:11:00,566;00:11:03,835;But there can only be
113;00:11:00,566;00:11:03,835;one champion.
114;00:11:03,869;00:11:05,937;Brienne of Tarth,
115;00:11:05,971;00:11:07,840;you may ask anything
115;00:11:05,971;00:11:07,840;of me you desire.
116;00:11:07,874;00:11:10,876;If it is within my power,
116;00:11:07,874;00:11:10,876;it is yours.
117;00:11:12,745;00:11:14,413;Your Grace,
118;00:11:14,447;00:11:17,582;I ask the honor of a place
118;00:11:14,447;00:11:17,582;in your Kingsguard.
119;00:11:17,616;00:11:19,451;What?
120;00:11:19,485;00:11:22,654;I will be one of your seven,
120;00:11:19,485;00:11:22,654;pledge my life to yours,
121;00:11:22,688;00:11:25,023;and keep you safe
121;00:11:22,688;00:11:25,023;from all harm.
122;00:11:29,062;00:11:30,429;Done.
123;00:11:30,463;00:11:33,631;Rise, Brienne
123;00:11:30,463;00:11:33,631;of the Kingsguard.
124;00:11:42,608;00:11:45,876;Your Grace, I have the honor to
124;00:11:42,608;00:11:45,876;bring you Lady Catelyn Stark,
125;00:11:45,910;00:11:48,978;sent as an envoy by her son Robb,
125;00:11:45,910;00:11:48,978;Lord of Winterfell.
126;00:11:49,013;00:11:52,649;Lord of Winterfell
126;00:11:49,013;00:11:52,649;and King in the North.
127;00:11:52,683;00:11:56,286;Lady Catelyn.
127;00:11:52,683;00:11:56,286;I'm pleased to see you.
128;00:11:56,320;00:11:59,790;May I present my wife
128;00:11:56,320;00:11:59,790;Margaery of House Tyrell?
129;00:12:01,060;00:12:03,328;You are very welcome
129;00:12:01,060;00:12:03,328;here, Lady Stark.
130;00:12:03,362;00:12:05,464;I'm so sorry
130;00:12:03,362;00:12:05,464;for your loss.
131;00:12:06,633;00:12:08,334;You are most kind.
132;00:12:08,368;00:12:10,902;My Lady,
133;00:12:10,937;00:12:13,571;I swear to you I will see
133;00:12:10,937;00:12:13,571;the Lannisters answer
134;00:12:13,606;00:12:15,807;for your husband's murder.
135;00:12:15,841;00:12:18,242;When I take King's Landing,
136;00:12:18,276;00:12:20,310;I'll bring you
136;00:12:18,276;00:12:20,310;Joffrey's head.
137;00:12:28,719;00:12:32,188;It will be enough to know that
137;00:12:28,719;00:12:32,188;justice was done, My Lord.
138;00:12:32,223;00:12:34,691;Your Grace.
139;00:12:34,725;00:12:37,094;And you should kneel
139;00:12:34,725;00:12:37,094;when you approach the King.
140;00:12:37,128;00:12:40,497;There's no need for that.
140;00:12:37,128;00:12:40,497;Lady Stark is an honored guest.
141;00:12:40,532;00:12:42,934;Has your son marched against
141;00:12:40,532;00:12:42,934;Tywin Lannister yet?
142;00:12:44,303;00:12:46,972;I do not sit on
142;00:12:44,303;00:12:46,972;my son's war councils.
143;00:12:47,006;00:12:50,909;And if I did, I would not share his
143;00:12:47,006;00:12:50,909;strategies with you.
144;00:12:50,943;00:12:53,878;If Robb Stark wants a pact with us,
144;00:12:50,943;00:12:53,878;he should come himself,
145;00:12:53,913;00:12:55,947;not hide behind
145;00:12:53,913;00:12:55,947;his mother's skirts.
146;00:12:55,981;00:12:58,983;My son is fighting a war,
147;00:12:59,017;00:13:00,918;not playing at one.
148;00:13:13,864;00:13:16,099;Don't worry, My Lady.
149;00:13:16,133;00:13:18,201;Our war is just beginning.
150;00:13:31,349;00:13:33,616;Your Grace.
150;00:13:31,349;00:13:33,616;Gerard.
151;00:13:33,650;00:13:36,285;How's your foot?
151;00:13:33,650;00:13:36,285;Better, Your Grace.
152;00:13:36,319;00:13:38,620;They don't know
152;00:13:36,319;00:13:38,620;their own size is all.
153;00:13:38,655;00:13:40,789;Good man.
154;00:13:42,592;00:13:44,659;I have 100,000 men
154;00:13:42,592;00:13:44,659;at my command.
155;00:13:44,694;00:13:47,295;All the might of the Stormlands
155;00:13:44,694;00:13:47,295;and the Reach.
156;00:13:47,329;00:13:50,665;And all of them young and bold
156;00:13:47,329;00:13:50,665;like your Knight of Flowers?
157;00:13:51,834;00:13:54,403;It's a game to you,
157;00:13:51,834;00:13:54,403;isn't it?
158;00:13:54,437;00:13:56,705;I pity them.
158;00:13:54,437;00:13:56,705;Why?
159;00:13:56,740;00:13:58,607;Because it won't last.
160;00:13:58,642;00:14:02,912;Because they are the Knights of summer
160;00:13:58,642;00:14:02,912;and winter is coming.
161;00:14:04,215;00:14:08,586;Brienne, escort
161;00:14:04,215;00:14:08,586;Lady Catelyn to her tent.
162;00:14:08,620;00:14:11,623;She's tired from her journey.
162;00:14:08,620;00:14:11,623;At once, Your Grace.
163;00:14:11,657;00:14:13,892;Shall I return after?
163;00:14:11,657;00:14:13,892;That won't be necessary.
164;00:14:13,926;00:14:17,262;I would pray awhile.
164;00:14:13,926;00:14:17,262;Alone.
165;00:14:18,531;00:14:20,565;If you'll follow me,
165;00:14:18,531;00:14:20,565;My Lady.
166;00:14:23,502;00:14:26,204;You fought bravely today,
166;00:14:23,502;00:14:26,204;Lady Brienne.
167;00:14:26,238;00:14:28,606;I fought for my King.
168;00:14:28,640;00:14:31,309;Soon I'll fight for him
168;00:14:28,640;00:14:31,309;on the battlefield.
169;00:14:31,343;00:14:34,011;Die for him
169;00:14:31,343;00:14:34,011;if I must.
170;00:14:34,045;00:14:38,215;And, if it please you,
170;00:14:34,045;00:14:38,215;Brienne's enough.
171;00:14:38,249;00:14:40,451;I'm no lady.
172;00:15:11,784;00:15:13,752;What are you doing here?
173;00:15:13,787;00:15:15,988;I live here.
174;00:15:16,022;00:15:20,126;Are you angry with me, brother?
174;00:15:16,022;00:15:20,126;You lying bitch.
175;00:15:20,160;00:15:23,162;It's not my fault
175;00:15:20,160;00:15:23,162;you didn't recognize me.
176;00:15:23,197;00:15:26,432;Recognize you?
176;00:15:23,197;00:15:26,432;How could I?
177;00:15:26,466;00:15:28,334;The last time I saw you...
178;00:15:29,736;00:15:31,871;You looked like
178;00:15:29,736;00:15:31,871;a fat little boy.
179;00:15:32,907;00:15:35,541;You were a fat
179;00:15:32,907;00:15:35,541;little boy, too,
180;00:15:35,575;00:15:38,111;but I recognized you.
181;00:15:38,146;00:15:39,579;Why didn't you tell me?
182;00:15:39,614;00:15:41,649;I wanted to see
182;00:15:39,614;00:15:41,649;who you were first.
183;00:15:41,683;00:15:43,684;And I did.
184;00:15:45,888;00:15:48,957;The plans are made.
184;00:15:45,888;00:15:48,957;It's time you heard them.
185;00:15:48,991;00:15:51,859;Father.
185;00:15:48,991;00:15:51,859;Father.
186;00:15:53,295;00:15:55,696;The wolf pup
186;00:15:53,295;00:15:55,696;has gone south
187;00:15:55,731;00:15:59,266;with the entirety of the northern
187;00:15:55,731;00:15:59,266;army at his back.
188;00:15:59,301;00:16:01,602;While he's tangling with
188;00:15:59,301;00:16:01,602;the lion in the Westerlands,
189;00:16:01,637;00:16:04,371;the north is ripe
189;00:16:01,637;00:16:04,371;for the taking.
190;00:16:04,405;00:16:08,008;The Ironborn will reave and
190;00:16:04,405;00:16:08,008;pillage as it was in the old days
191;00:16:08,042;00:16:10,043;all along the northern coast.
192;00:16:10,077;00:16:13,114;We'll spread our dominion
192;00:16:10,077;00:16:13,114;across the green lands,
193;00:16:13,148;00:16:16,017;securing the Neck
193;00:16:13,148;00:16:16,017;and everything above.
194;00:16:16,051;00:16:18,954;Every stronghold will yield
194;00:16:16,051;00:16:18,954;to us one by one.
195;00:16:18,989;00:16:21,657;Winterfell may defy us
195;00:16:18,989;00:16:21,657;for a year, but what of it?
196;00:16:21,692;00:16:23,693;The rest shall be ours--
197;00:16:23,727;00:16:27,197;forest, field and hall.
198;00:16:31,036;00:16:34,137;Yara, my daughter,
198;00:16:31,036;00:16:34,137;you'll take 30 longships
199;00:16:34,172;00:16:36,040;to attack Deepwood Motte.
200;00:16:36,074;00:16:38,142;I've always wanted
200;00:16:36,074;00:16:38,142;a castle.
201;00:16:38,176;00:16:40,844;And what's my role
201;00:16:38,176;00:16:40,844;in all this?
202;00:16:42,447;00:16:45,983;You'll take a ship to raid the
202;00:16:42,447;00:16:45,983;fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.
203;00:16:46,017;00:16:47,751;A ship?
204;00:16:47,786;00:16:49,820;You give her 30
204;00:16:47,786;00:16:49,820;and I get one?
205;00:16:49,855;00:16:53,357;The sea bitch. We thought
205;00:16:49,855;00:16:53,357;she'd be perfect for you.
206;00:16:55,528;00:16:56,961;I'm to fight fishermen?
207;00:16:56,996;00:16:59,398;Be careful
207;00:16:56,996;00:16:59,398;of their nets.
208;00:17:02,335;00:17:06,740;Father, I fought with Robb Stark.
208;00:17:02,335;00:17:06,740;I know his men.
209;00:17:06,774;00:17:08,542;He won't give up
209;00:17:06,774;00:17:08,542;the North so easily.
210;00:17:08,576;00:17:10,377;They won't even know we're
210;00:17:08,576;00:17:10,377;there until it's too late.
211;00:17:10,411;00:17:11,711;What do you
211;00:17:10,411;00:17:11,711;know of it, woman?
212;00:17:11,746;00:17:13,480;I'm a proven warrior.
213;00:17:13,514;00:17:16,616;Your brothers were warriors,
213;00:17:13,514;00:17:16,616;both of them dead
214;00:17:16,650;00:17:20,286;at the hands of those
214;00:17:16,650;00:17:20,286;you seem so eager to protect.
215;00:17:21,955;00:17:23,789;I'm not protecting anyone.
216;00:17:23,823;00:17:26,091;I just wonder
216;00:17:23,823;00:17:26,091;if it's not wiser to wait.
217;00:17:26,126;00:17:29,828;Why risk going against the North
217;00:17:26,126;00:17:29,828;if they would be our allies?
218;00:17:29,862;00:17:32,497;Rise up against them
218;00:17:29,862;00:17:32,497;and they could destroy us.
219;00:17:32,532;00:17:34,967;But if we pledge
219;00:17:32,532;00:17:34,967;fealty to them,
220;00:17:35,002;00:17:37,036;they'll give us
220;00:17:35,002;00:17:37,036;Casterly Rock.
221;00:17:37,070;00:17:40,074;What are our words?
222;00:17:40,108;00:17:41,942;Our words?
223;00:17:44,380;00:17:47,149;We do not sow.
223;00:17:44,380;00:17:47,149;We do not sow.
224;00:17:47,183;00:17:48,951;We are Ironborn.
225;00:17:48,985;00:17:51,820;We're not subjects.
225;00:17:48,985;00:17:51,820;We're not slaves.
226;00:17:51,855;00:17:54,957;We do not plow the fields
226;00:17:51,855;00:17:54,957;or toil in the mine.
227;00:17:54,991;00:17:57,994;We take what is ours.
228;00:17:58,028;00:18:01,531;Your time with the wolves
228;00:17:58,028;00:18:01,531;has made you weak.
229;00:18:05,136;00:18:08,204;You act as if
229;00:18:05,136;00:18:08,204;I volunteered to go.
230;00:18:08,239;00:18:11,207;You gave me away,
230;00:18:08,239;00:18:11,207;if you remember.
231;00:18:11,241;00:18:13,543;The day you bent the knee
231;00:18:11,241;00:18:13,543;to Robert Baratheon.
232;00:18:13,577;00:18:15,845;After he crushed you.
233;00:18:15,879;00:18:17,747;Did you take
233;00:18:15,879;00:18:17,747;what was yours then?
234;00:18:21,685;00:18:23,386;You gave me away!
235;00:18:24,488;00:18:26,556;Your boy!
236;00:18:26,590;00:18:28,959;Your last boy!
237;00:18:28,993;00:18:32,762;You gave me away like I was some dog
237;00:18:28,993;00:18:32,762;you didn't want anymore.
238;00:18:32,797;00:18:36,166;And now you curse me
238;00:18:32,797;00:18:36,166;because I've come home.
239;00:18:46,077;00:18:49,479;You'd have our father bow
239;00:18:46,077;00:18:49,479;down to your other family?
240;00:18:49,514;00:18:52,081;I have no other family.
241;00:18:52,116;00:18:54,150;Don't you?
242;00:18:55,385;00:18:57,687;Make your choice, Theon,
242;00:18:55,385;00:18:57,687;and do it quickly.
243;00:18:57,722;00:19:00,490;Our ships sail
243;00:18:57,722;00:19:00,490;with or without you.
244;00:19:12,636;00:19:14,303;You won't let me
244;00:19:12,636;00:19:14,303;leave this room.
245;00:19:14,338;00:19:17,340;You won't let me--
245;00:19:14,338;00:19:17,340;Shh, shh, keep your voice down.
246;00:19:20,010;00:19:23,446;Why? You think your father
246;00:19:20,010;00:19:23,446;can hear me?
247;00:19:23,480;00:19:26,115;He's 300 miles away!
248;00:19:28,152;00:19:31,153;I don't intend for you
248;00:19:28,152;00:19:31,153;to stay here.
249;00:19:31,188;00:19:34,090;I might be able to bring you into
249;00:19:31,188;00:19:34,090;the castle kitchens.
250;00:19:34,124;00:19:37,793;Again, only temporary.
251;00:19:37,827;00:19:40,362;Every man who has
251;00:19:37,827;00:19:40,362;tasted my cooking
252;00:19:40,397;00:19:42,398;has told me what
252;00:19:40,397;00:19:42,398;a good whore I am.
253;00:19:42,432;00:19:44,400;But you wouldn't
253;00:19:42,432;00:19:44,400;be a cook.
254;00:19:44,434;00:19:48,137;You'd pose
254;00:19:44,434;00:19:48,137;as a scullion.
255;00:19:48,172;00:19:51,374;Scullion?
255;00:19:48,172;00:19:51,374;What is a scullion?
256;00:19:51,409;00:19:54,077;Kitchen wench.
257;00:19:54,111;00:19:56,780;A kitchen wench?
257;00:19:54,111;00:19:56,780;Yes, but--
258;00:19:56,814;00:19:58,308;Cleaning pots?
259;00:19:58,333;00:20:00,901;Is that how my lion
259;00:19:58,333;00:20:00,901;wants to see me?
260;00:20:00,985;00:20:03,720;Your lion wants
260;00:20:00,985;00:20:03,720;to see you alive.
261;00:20:03,754;00:20:06,189;We've come to
261;00:20:03,754;00:20:06,189;a dangerous place.
262;00:20:06,223;00:20:08,024;My sister wants to hurt me.
263;00:20:08,059;00:20:10,226;She'll look for any
263;00:20:08,059;00:20:10,226;weakness she can find.
264;00:20:10,260;00:20:12,128;She can't know about you.
265;00:20:12,162;00:20:14,263;I'm the weakness?
266;00:20:14,298;00:20:15,764;It's a compliment,
266;00:20:14,298;00:20:15,764;My Lady.
267;00:20:15,799;00:20:19,467;How is being a weakness
267;00:20:15,799;00:20:19,467;a compliment?
268;00:20:22,538;00:20:24,239;Language can be
268;00:20:22,538;00:20:24,239;a bit tricky here.
269;00:20:24,273;00:20:28,109;Oh, I'm too stupid
269;00:20:24,273;00:20:28,109;to understand.
270;00:20:28,143;00:20:30,511;The stupid foreign girl.
271;00:20:32,948;00:20:36,250;I am not
271;00:20:32,948;00:20:36,250;a kitchen wench.
272;00:21:00,974;00:21:03,476;When will Joffrey
272;00:21:00,974;00:21:03,476;and Sansa be married?
273;00:21:03,510;00:21:06,044;Soon, darling,
273;00:21:03,510;00:21:06,044;when the war is over.
274;00:21:06,079;00:21:08,980;Mother says I'll have
274;00:21:06,079;00:21:08,980;a new gown for the ceremony
275;00:21:09,015;00:21:11,450;and another for the feast.
276;00:21:11,484;00:21:14,553;But yours will be ivory
276;00:21:11,484;00:21:14,553;since you're the bride.
277;00:21:18,692;00:21:20,894;The Princess
277;00:21:18,692;00:21:20,894;just spoke to you.
278;00:21:20,928;00:21:22,997;Pardon, Your Grace.
279;00:21:25,367;00:21:27,668;I'm sure your dress will
279;00:21:25,367;00:21:27,668;be beautiful, Myrcella.
280;00:21:27,702;00:21:31,238;I'm counting the days
280;00:21:27,702;00:21:31,238;until the fighting is done
281;00:21:31,273;00:21:35,342;and I can pledge my love to
281;00:21:31,273;00:21:35,342;the King in sight of the Gods.
282;00:21:39,546;00:21:41,814;Is Joffrey going to kill
282;00:21:39,546;00:21:41,814;Sansa's brother?
283;00:21:44,351;00:21:46,418;He might.
284;00:21:48,054;00:21:50,488;Would you like that?
285;00:21:52,024;00:21:54,659;No.
285;00:21:52,024;00:21:54,659;I don't think so.
286;00:21:55,895;00:21:59,564;Even if he does,
286;00:21:55,895;00:21:59,564;Sansa will do her duty.
287;00:22:01,334;00:22:03,335;Won't you, little dove?
288;00:22:19,919;00:22:22,954;Come in.
289;00:22:26,759;00:22:28,126;Who are you?
290;00:22:28,160;00:22:31,062;I'm Shae, My Lady.
290;00:22:28,160;00:22:31,062;Your new handmaiden.
291;00:22:31,097;00:22:34,499;I didn't know I needed
291;00:22:31,097;00:22:34,499;a new handmaiden.
292;00:22:36,102;00:22:38,904;You're not from here.
292;00:22:36,102;00:22:38,904;No.
293;00:22:45,013;00:22:46,547;What are you doing?
294;00:22:46,581;00:22:48,449;Waiting for you
294;00:22:46,581;00:22:48,449;to tell me what to do.
295;00:22:48,484;00:22:50,718;I shouldn't have to tell
295;00:22:48,484;00:22:50,718;you to do things.
296;00:22:50,753;00:22:52,988;You should just do them.
297;00:22:53,022;00:22:55,190;What things?
298;00:22:55,224;00:22:57,292;Change my linens,
298;00:22:55,224;00:22:57,292;wash my clothing,
299;00:22:57,326;00:23:00,929;scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot,
299;00:22:57,326;00:23:00,929;brush my hair.
300;00:23:09,772;00:23:11,606;No.
300;00:23:09,772;00:23:11,606;You said to brush--
301;00:23:11,641;00:23:14,442;Not now.
302;00:23:16,012;00:23:18,880;Your chamber pot
302;00:23:16,012;00:23:18,880;is empty.
303;00:23:18,914;00:23:21,183;Clean the table.
304;00:23:25,788;00:23:28,590;Have you ever been
304;00:23:25,788;00:23:28,590;a handmaiden before?
305;00:23:28,624;00:23:30,659;Yes.
305;00:23:28,624;00:23:30,659;For whom?
306;00:23:30,694;00:23:32,694;Lady Zuriff.
306;00:23:30,694;00:23:32,694;Lady Zuriff?
307;00:23:34,698;00:23:36,598;Lady Zuriff.
308;00:23:36,633;00:23:40,336;There is no Lady Zuriff
308;00:23:36,633;00:23:40,336;in this city.
309;00:23:40,370;00:23:42,271;She wasn't in
309;00:23:40,370;00:23:42,271;this city.
310;00:23:42,305;00:23:44,707;Well, I don't know how
310;00:23:42,305;00:23:44,707;they did things in that city,
311;00:23:44,741;00:23:47,676;but in this city,
311;00:23:44,741;00:23:47,676;handmaidens wait on ladies,
312;00:23:47,710;00:23:49,245;not the other way around.
313;00:23:49,279;00:23:52,181;And I don't have time
313;00:23:49,279;00:23:52,181;to answer 1,000 questions
314;00:23:52,215;00:23:54,683;and teach you
314;00:23:52,215;00:23:54,683;how to do your job.
315;00:23:57,854;00:23:59,521;Do you want me to leave?
316;00:24:07,430;00:24:09,465;Just brush my hair.
317;00:24:23,749;00:24:26,351;Oh, thank the Gods.
318;00:24:26,385;00:24:28,620;I haven't had
318;00:24:26,385;00:24:28,620;a proper shit in six days.
319;00:24:28,654;00:24:32,157;I've encountered this
319;00:24:28,654;00:24:32,157;problem before, My Lord.
320;00:24:32,191;00:24:35,694;The stresses of power
320;00:24:32,191;00:24:35,694;often have this
321;00:24:35,728;00:24:37,529;insalubrious effect.
322;00:24:37,564;00:24:40,698;Two drops
322;00:24:37,564;00:24:40,698;with water daily.
323;00:24:40,733;00:24:42,600;Right. I'm so grateful
323;00:24:40,733;00:24:42,600;to have a man
324;00:24:42,635;00:24:45,336;of your vast knowledge
324;00:24:42,635;00:24:45,336;and wisdom on my side.
325;00:24:45,371;00:24:48,239;Please.
325;00:24:45,371;00:24:48,239;Thank you, My Lord.
326;00:24:53,045;00:24:55,147;I can trust you,
326;00:24:53,045;00:24:55,147;Pycelle, can I not?
327;00:24:55,181;00:24:56,982;Why, yes, of course,
327;00:24:55,181;00:24:56,982;My Lord.
328;00:24:57,017;00:24:59,185;These are perilous times.
329;00:24:59,220;00:25:01,187;And the crown must forge
329;00:24:59,220;00:25:01,187;new alliances.
330;00:25:02,590;00:25:06,327;And these alliances must often
330;00:25:02,590;00:25:06,327;be sealed in matrimony.
331;00:25:06,361;00:25:08,863;Matrimony, huh?
332;00:25:08,897;00:25:10,799;Yes.
333;00:25:10,833;00:25:13,034;I'm trusting the council
333;00:25:10,833;00:25:13,034;with these plans,
334;00:25:13,069;00:25:14,803;but the queen mustn't know.
335;00:25:14,837;00:25:17,405;We can't have her
335;00:25:14,837;00:25:17,405;meddling in affairs
336;00:25:17,440;00:25:18,785;that could determine
336;00:25:17,440;00:25:18,785;the future of the realm.
337;00:25:18,810;00:25:20,010;There's too much at stake.
338;00:25:20,176;00:25:23,144;Oh, yes, yes.
338;00:25:20,176;00:25:23,144;Indeed, yes.
339;00:25:23,179;00:25:26,447;I shall be silent
339;00:25:23,179;00:25:26,447;as the grave.
340;00:25:26,482;00:25:30,551;I'm brokering an alliance
340;00:25:26,482;00:25:30,551;with House Martell of Dorne.
341;00:25:30,586;00:25:33,054;Princess Myrcella will wed
341;00:25:30,586;00:25:33,054;their youngest son
342;00:25:33,088;00:25:36,024;when she comes of age,
342;00:25:33,088;00:25:36,024;ensuring their loyalty
343;00:25:36,059;00:25:38,728;and their army
343;00:25:36,059;00:25:38,728;should we need it.
344;00:25:38,762;00:25:42,733;Myrcella sent away
344;00:25:38,762;00:25:42,733;to Dorne?
345;00:25:44,436;00:25:47,806;But remember,
345;00:25:44,436;00:25:47,806;the queen mustn't know.
346;00:25:47,840;00:25:51,109;Ooh, the queen
346;00:25:47,840;00:25:51,109;mustn't know.
347;00:25:51,144;00:25:54,679;I love conversations
347;00:25:51,144;00:25:54,679;that begin this way.
348;00:25:54,714;00:25:57,949;I plan to marry
348;00:25:54,714;00:25:57,949;Princess Myrcella off
349;00:25:57,984;00:25:59,684;to Theon Greyjoy.
350;00:26:01,254;00:26:03,455;Theon Greyjoy?
351;00:26:03,489;00:26:06,224;Forgive me, My Lord,?
352;00:26:06,258;00:26:09,127;He grew up a ward
352;00:26:06,258;00:26:09,127;of Winterfell.
353;00:26:09,162;00:26:10,795;He fights
353;00:26:09,162;00:26:10,795;for Robb Stark.
354;00:26:10,829;00:26:14,365;Precisely. Theon's father
354;00:26:10,829;00:26:14,365;loathes the Starks
355;00:26:14,399;00:26:17,168;and will convince the boy
355;00:26:14,399;00:26:17,168;to come to our side.
356;00:26:17,236;00:26:20,671;Greyjoy can destroy
356;00:26:17,236;00:26:20,671;the northern army from within
357;00:26:20,706;00:26:23,240;and we can have
357;00:26:20,706;00:26:23,240;his father's ships.
358;00:26:23,275;00:26:26,777;But remember,
358;00:26:23,275;00:26:26,777;you must tell no one.
359;00:26:26,812;00:26:29,347;Tell no one what?
360;00:26:29,381;00:26:33,351;I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to
360;00:26:29,381;00:26:33,351;Robin Arryn of the Vale.
361;00:26:35,054;00:26:38,222;Lysa is not fond of me.
362;00:26:38,257;00:26:40,592;But perhaps the promise
362;00:26:38,257;00:26:40,592;of a royal match
363;00:26:40,626;00:26:43,861;will convince her
363;00:26:40,626;00:26:43,861;to let bygones be bygones.
364;00:26:43,895;00:26:45,830;She imprisoned you.
365;00:26:45,864;00:26:47,932;She tried
365;00:26:45,864;00:26:47,932;to execute you.
366;00:26:47,966;00:26:50,901;And you offer
366;00:26:47,966;00:26:50,901;her son a princess?
367;00:26:50,936;00:26:54,771;For men in our position,
367;00:26:50,936;00:26:54,771;holding grudges can be
368;00:26:54,806;00:26:56,573;an encumbrance,
368;00:26:54,806;00:26:56,573;don't you think?
369;00:26:56,608;00:27:00,978;And I suppose you want me
369;00:26:56,608;00:27:00,978;to broker this agreement?
370;00:27:01,012;00:27:02,646;Who better?
371;00:27:06,784;00:27:09,252;Yes, I could sing
371;00:27:06,784;00:27:09,252;this song to Lysa,
372;00:27:09,286;00:27:11,521;if I cared to.
373;00:27:11,555;00:27:13,757;What's in it
373;00:27:11,555;00:27:13,757;for me?
374;00:27:15,627;00:27:17,896;The gratitude of
374;00:27:15,627;00:27:17,896;the people of Westeros
375;00:27:17,930;00:27:19,631;for helping to end
375;00:27:17,930;00:27:19,631;this war,
376;00:27:19,666;00:27:23,836;the adoration of the King for
376;00:27:19,666;00:27:23,836;bringing the Vale back into the fold...
377;00:27:25,639;00:27:27,507;and Harrenhal.
378;00:27:27,541;00:27:29,942;Harrenhal is cursed.
379;00:27:29,977;00:27:31,878;Never took you
379;00:27:29,977;00:27:31,878;for a superstitious man.
380;00:27:31,912;00:27:33,812;By all means,
380;00:27:31,912;00:27:33,812;tear it down and rebuild.
381;00:27:33,847;00:27:35,614;You'll be able
381;00:27:33,847;00:27:35,614;to afford it.
382;00:27:35,648;00:27:38,450;I plan to make you
382;00:27:35,648;00:27:38,450;Lord of the Riverlands.
383;00:27:40,352;00:27:42,091;With a single stroke,
383;00:27:40,352;00:27:42,091;you'd make me one of the
384;00:27:42,116;00:27:43,154;greatest lords in the realm.
385;00:27:43,155;00:27:46,423;You served my family well
385;00:27:43,155;00:27:46,423;in the matter of the succession.
386;00:27:46,458;00:27:49,660;So did Janos Slynt, and he
386;00:27:46,458;00:27:49,660;was given Harrenhal, too.
387;00:27:49,694;00:27:52,596;Until you snatched it away.
388;00:27:52,631;00:27:54,932;I need you to
388;00:27:52,631;00:27:54,932;deliver Lysa Arryn.
389;00:27:54,966;00:27:57,702;I didn't need
389;00:27:54,966;00:27:57,702;Janos Slynt.
390;00:28:00,106;00:28:02,574;It's settled, then?
391;00:28:03,677;00:28:05,310;Good.
392;00:28:07,547;00:28:09,748;Oh, and remember--
393;00:28:09,783;00:28:11,617;the queen mustn't know.
394;00:28:50,492;00:28:52,159;That must hurt.
395;00:29:02,304;00:29:04,405;What?
396;00:29:06,041;00:29:07,474;What is it?
397;00:29:09,544;00:29:12,413;A member of the Kingsguard?
398;00:29:12,447;00:29:15,283;As if I wasn't humiliated
398;00:29:12,447;00:29:15,283;enough already.
399;00:29:17,586;00:29:21,823;Brienne is a very
399;00:29:17,586;00:29:21,823;capable warrior.
400;00:29:23,025;00:29:25,393;And she's devoted to me.
401;00:29:27,063;00:29:29,631;You're jealous.
402;00:29:29,665;00:29:31,567;Jealous?
403;00:29:31,601;00:29:33,769;Of Brienne the beauty?
404;00:29:33,803;00:29:35,870;Don't make me laugh.
405;00:29:37,507;00:29:41,242;I'll make it up to you.
405;00:29:37,507;00:29:41,242;No, Your Grace.
406;00:29:42,378;00:29:44,579;Not tonight.
407;00:29:44,614;00:29:47,248;There's another Tyrell
407;00:29:44,614;00:29:47,248;who requires your attention.
408;00:29:47,283;00:29:48,983;You didn't win
408;00:29:47,283;00:29:48,983;my father's support
409;00:29:49,018;00:29:51,152;or his army
409;00:29:49,018;00:29:51,152;on charm alone.
410;00:30:04,800;00:30:08,569;Your vassals are starting
410;00:30:04,800;00:30:08,569;to snigger behind your back.
411;00:30:08,603;00:30:11,572;Brides aren't usually virgins
411;00:30:08,603;00:30:11,572;two weeks after their wedding night.
412;00:30:11,607;00:30:13,475;And Margaery's a virgin?
413;00:30:13,509;00:30:15,711;Officially.
414;00:30:17,046;00:30:19,081;Shall I bring her
414;00:30:17,046;00:30:19,081;to you?
415;00:30:45,880;00:30:47,781;I should warn you,
416;00:30:47,815;00:30:49,749;I've had quite
416;00:30:47,815;00:30:49,749;a bit of wine.
417;00:30:49,784;00:30:52,319;As is your right.
417;00:30:49,784;00:30:52,319;You are a King.
418;00:30:54,223;00:30:56,391;You look
418;00:30:54,223;00:30:56,391;very beautiful.
419;00:30:56,425;00:30:58,292;Thank you,
419;00:30:56,425;00:30:58,292;Your Grace.
420;00:30:58,327;00:31:02,264;It's a lovely gown.
420;00:30:58,327;00:31:02,264;You think so?
421;00:31:02,298;00:31:05,034;I can't decide
421;00:31:02,298;00:31:05,034;how I like it better.
422;00:31:05,069;00:31:07,170;This way...
423;00:31:07,204;00:31:10,207;or this way.
424;00:31:16,348;00:31:17,981;You certainly don't need it.
425;00:31:19,617;00:31:21,085;Although...
426;00:31:21,119;00:31:24,722;some say that
426;00:31:21,119;00:31:24,722;beauty most desired
427;00:31:24,756;00:31:26,524;is the beauty concealed.
428;00:31:42,976;00:31:45,211;Must be the wine.
429;00:31:45,245;00:31:47,813;Here, let me.
430;00:32:07,800;00:32:09,768;I'm sorry.
431;00:32:09,802;00:32:11,970;Do you want my brother
431;00:32:09,802;00:32:11,970;to come in and help?
432;00:32:14,974;00:32:17,376;What?
432;00:32:14,974;00:32:17,376;He could get you started.
433;00:32:17,410;00:32:18,742;I know he wouldn't mind.
434;00:32:18,767;00:32:21,346;Or I can turn over and you
434;00:32:18,767;00:32:21,346;can pretend I'm him.
435;00:32:23,450;00:32:26,152;I don't know what
435;00:32:23,450;00:32:26,152;you're talking about.
436;00:32:31,326;00:32:34,128;There's no need
436;00:32:31,326;00:32:34,128;for us to play games.
437;00:32:34,163;00:32:37,365;Save your lies for court.
437;00:32:34,163;00:32:37,365;You're going to need a lot of them.
438;00:32:55,985;00:32:58,886;Your enemies
438;00:32:55,985;00:32:58,886;aren't happy about us.
439;00:32:58,921;00:33:01,255;They want to tear
439;00:32:58,921;00:33:01,255;us apart.
440;00:33:01,290;00:33:04,358;And the best way
440;00:33:01,290;00:33:04,358;to stop them
441;00:33:04,392;00:33:07,695;is to put your baby
442;00:33:07,729;00:33:10,197;in my belly.
443;00:33:13,100;00:33:15,603;We can try again later.
444;00:33:15,637;00:33:17,505;You decide how
444;00:33:15,637;00:33:17,505;you want to do it--
445;00:33:17,539;00:33:19,407;with me,
445;00:33:17,539;00:33:19,407;with me and Loras.
446;00:33:19,441;00:33:21,910;However else you like.
447;00:33:24,281;00:33:26,982;Whatever you need to do.
448;00:33:28,985;00:33:32,288;You are a King.
449;00:33:40,598;00:33:42,865;You monster.
450;00:33:42,899;00:33:45,234;Myrcella is my only daughter.
451;00:33:45,269;00:33:47,937;Do you really think I'll let you
451;00:33:45,269;00:33:47,937;sell her like a common whore?
452;00:33:47,971;00:33:49,505;Myrcella's a Princess.
453;00:33:49,539;00:33:51,173;Some would say
453;00:33:49,539;00:33:51,173;she was born for this.
454;00:33:51,208;00:33:52,875;I will not let you
454;00:33:51,208;00:33:52,875;ship her off to Dorne
455;00:33:52,943;00:33:55,044;as I was shipped off
455;00:33:52,943;00:33:55,044;to Robert Baratheon.
456;00:33:55,078;00:33:57,379;Dorne is the safest place
456;00:33:55,078;00:33:57,379;or her.
457;00:33:57,413;00:34:00,816;Are you mad?
457;00:33:57,413;00:34:00,816;The Martells loathe us.
458;00:34:00,850;00:34:03,285;That's why we need
458;00:34:00,850;00:34:03,285;to seduce them.
459;00:34:03,319;00:34:05,153;We're going to need
459;00:34:03,319;00:34:05,153;their support in the war
460;00:34:05,188;00:34:07,055;your son started.
461;00:34:07,090;00:34:09,324;She'll be a hostage.
461;00:34:07,090;00:34:09,324;A guest.
462;00:34:09,359;00:34:11,961;You won't get away
462;00:34:09,359;00:34:11,961;with this.
463;00:34:11,995;00:34:15,931;You think the piece of paper father
463;00:34:11,995;00:34:15,931;gave you keeps you safe.
464;00:34:18,568;00:34:21,437;Ned Stark had a piece
464;00:34:18,568;00:34:21,437;of paper, too.
465;00:34:23,039;00:34:25,807;It's done, Cersei.
465;00:34:23,039;00:34:25,807;No.
466;00:34:25,842;00:34:30,045;You cannot stop it.
466;00:34:25,842;00:34:30,045;No!
467;00:34:32,248;00:34:35,516;Just how safe do you think
467;00:34:32,248;00:34:35,516;Myrcella is if this city falls?
468;00:34:35,550;00:34:39,386;Do you want to see her raped,
468;00:34:35,550;00:34:39,386;butchered like the Targaryen children?
469;00:34:39,420;00:34:41,655;Make no mistake.
470;00:34:41,689;00:34:44,291;They'll mount her pretty little head
470;00:34:41,689;00:34:44,291;on a spike right beside yours.
471;00:34:44,325;00:34:46,626;Get out!
471;00:34:44,325;00:34:46,626;Get out!
472;00:35:48,154;00:35:51,056;Theon of
472;00:35:48,154;00:35:51,056;the House Greyjoy,
473;00:35:51,091;00:35:54,727;you would this day consecrate
473;00:35:51,091;00:35:54,727;your faith to the drowned God?
474;00:36:02,704;00:36:05,540;I would.
474;00:36:02,704;00:36:05,540;Kneel.
475;00:36:08,911;00:36:10,278;Let Theon,
475;00:36:08,911;00:36:10,278;your servant,
476;00:36:10,313;00:36:13,482;be born again from
476;00:36:10,313;00:36:13,482;the sea as you were.
477;00:36:13,516;00:36:16,251;Bless him with salt.
478;00:36:18,588;00:36:21,423;Bless him with stone.
479;00:36:21,458;00:36:23,225;Bless him with steel.
480;00:36:28,432;00:36:30,533;What is dead
480;00:36:28,432;00:36:30,533;may never die.
481;00:36:30,567;00:36:32,669;What is dead
481;00:36:30,567;00:36:32,669;may never die...
482;00:36:34,138;00:36:37,807;But rises again
482;00:36:34,138;00:36:37,807;harder and stronger.
483;00:36:37,842;00:36:39,943;Stand.
484;00:37:08,742;00:37:13,312;I don't appreciate being
484;00:37:08,742;00:37:13,312;made a fool of, dwarf.
485;00:37:13,347;00:37:14,847;If Myrcella marries
485;00:37:13,347;00:37:14,847;the Martell boy,
486;00:37:14,881;00:37:17,115;she can't very well
486;00:37:14,881;00:37:17,115;marry Robin Arryn, can she?
487;00:37:17,150;00:37:20,285;No, afraid not.
487;00:37:17,150;00:37:20,285;Sorry about that.
488;00:37:20,319;00:37:22,120;And Harrenhal--
489;00:37:22,154;00:37:25,223;I suppose that's
489;00:37:22,154;00:37:25,223;off the table as well.
490;00:37:25,257;00:37:28,960;Yes, I fear so.
490;00:37:25,257;00:37:28,960;Sorry about that, too.
491;00:37:28,994;00:37:31,161;Leave me out of your
491;00:37:28,994;00:37:31,161;next deception.
492;00:37:31,196;00:37:33,197;Oh, that's a shame.
493;00:37:33,231;00:37:36,533;You were to be the centerpiece of
493;00:37:33,231;00:37:36,533;my next deception.
494;00:37:36,568;00:37:39,837;My brother Jaime rots
494;00:37:36,568;00:37:39,837;in a Northern stockade.
495;00:37:39,872;00:37:42,073;I would see him released.
496;00:37:42,107;00:37:43,574;That's where you come in.
497;00:37:43,609;00:37:46,077;Robb Stark will never
497;00:37:43,609;00:37:46,077;release the Kingslayer.
498;00:37:46,111;00:37:49,748;No, he won't.
498;00:37:46,111;00:37:49,748;But his mother might.
499;00:37:49,782;00:37:52,685;How would you like to see
499;00:37:49,782;00:37:52,685;your beloved Cat again?
500;00:37:56,290;00:37:58,391;Find him?
500;00:37:56,290;00:37:58,391;Oh, aye.
501;00:37:58,426;00:38:00,360;And he has company.
502;00:38:01,997;00:38:04,765;Filthy old stoat.
502;00:38:01,997;00:38:04,765;Almost hate to interrupt.
503;00:38:04,800;00:38:08,169;No, you don't.
503;00:38:04,800;00:38:08,169;No, I don't.
504;00:38:15,077;00:38:17,779;What is the meaning
504;00:38:15,077;00:38:17,779;of this?
505;00:38:17,814;00:38:19,815;No, please, please.
506;00:38:19,849;00:38:22,250;You disappoint me,
506;00:38:19,849;00:38:22,250;Grand Maester.
507;00:38:22,284;00:38:25,020;I am your loyal servant.
508;00:38:25,054;00:38:26,856;So loyal that you told
508;00:38:25,054;00:38:26,856;the Queen about my plans
509;00:38:26,881;00:38:28,486;to send Myrcella to Dorne.
510;00:38:28,524;00:38:30,291;No! Never!
511;00:38:30,326;00:38:32,961;It's a falsehood.
511;00:38:30,326;00:38:32,961;I swear it.
512;00:38:32,995;00:38:34,463;It wasn't me.
513;00:38:34,497;00:38:36,198;Ah, Varys.
514;00:38:36,232;00:38:39,334;It was Varys
514;00:38:36,232;00:38:39,334;the spider.
515;00:38:39,369;00:38:43,505;See, I told Varys that I was giving
515;00:38:39,369;00:38:43,505;the Princess to the Greyjoys.
516;00:38:43,539;00:38:48,076;I told Littlefinger that I planned
516;00:38:43,539;00:38:48,076;to wed her to Robin Arryn.
517;00:38:48,110;00:38:51,547;I told no one that I was
517;00:38:48,110;00:38:51,547;offering her to the Dornish.
518;00:38:52,482;00:38:54,149;No one but you.
519;00:38:54,184;00:38:56,718;The eunuch has
519;00:38:54,184;00:38:56,718;spies everywhere.
520;00:38:56,753;00:38:59,154;Cut off his manhood
520;00:38:56,753;00:38:59,154;and feed it to the goats.
521;00:38:59,188;00:39:01,623;No, no, no.
521;00:38:59,188;00:39:01,623;There are no goats, halfman.
522;00:39:01,657;00:39:03,692;Well, make do.
523;00:39:05,795;00:39:08,097;How long have you
523;00:39:05,795;00:39:08,097;been spying for my sister?
524;00:39:08,131;00:39:10,733;All I did, I did
524;00:39:08,131;00:39:10,733;for House Lannister.
525;00:39:10,767;00:39:13,235;Always. Your lord father,
525;00:39:10,767;00:39:13,235;ask him.
526;00:39:13,270;00:39:15,070;I've always been
526;00:39:13,270;00:39:15,070;his servant
527;00:39:15,105;00:39:17,006;since the days
527;00:39:15,105;00:39:17,006;of the Mad King.
528;00:39:18,576;00:39:21,645;I don't like his beard.
528;00:39:18,576;00:39:21,645;What?
529;00:39:21,680;00:39:23,481;What?
529;00:39:21,680;00:39:23,481;Oh, no. No.
530;00:39:26,619;00:39:29,788;How many hands have you
530;00:39:26,619;00:39:29,788;betrayed, Pycelle?
531;00:39:29,822;00:39:32,257;Eddard Stark?
531;00:39:29,822;00:39:32,257;Jon Arryn?
532;00:39:32,292;00:39:34,025;Lord Arryn,
532;00:39:32,292;00:39:34,025;he knew.
533;00:39:34,060;00:39:36,995;He knew the truth
533;00:39:34,060;00:39:36,995;about the queen.
534;00:39:37,029;00:39:40,631;And, well,
534;00:39:37,029;00:39:40,631;he planned to act,
535;00:39:40,666;00:39:42,500;to tell King Robert.
536;00:39:42,534;00:39:43,834;So you poisoned him?
537;00:39:43,869;00:39:46,236;No. Never.
538;00:39:46,271;00:39:49,105;But you let him die,
538;00:39:46,271;00:39:49,105;made sure he succumbed.
539;00:39:49,140;00:39:51,674;Lannister--
539;00:39:49,140;00:39:51,674;I always served Lannister.
540;00:39:51,709;00:39:54,376;Get him out of my sight.
540;00:39:51,709;00:39:54,376;Throw him in one of the black cells.
541;00:39:54,411;00:39:56,278;Oh, no. No, no, no.
541;00:39:54,411;00:39:56,278;No, please.
542;00:39:56,313;00:39:58,480;Don't!
542;00:39:56,313;00:39:58,480;You can't do this to me!
543;00:40:00,083;00:40:01,283;For your trouble.
544;00:40:25,573;00:40:28,175;You'll be pleased to know
544;00:40:25,573;00:40:28,175;our mutual friend
545;00:40:28,209;00:40:31,611;is doing quite well
545;00:40:28,209;00:40:31,611;in Lady Sansa's service.
546;00:40:31,645;00:40:35,014;Good.
546;00:40:31,645;00:40:35,014;One of my better ideas.
547;00:40:35,048;00:40:37,383;And it seems
547;00:40:35,048;00:40:37,383;the Grand Maester
548;00:40:37,417;00:40:39,852;has found his way
548;00:40:37,417;00:40:39,852;into a black cell.
549;00:40:41,821;00:40:44,322;Well played,
549;00:40:41,821;00:40:44,322;My Lord Hand.
550;00:40:45,558;00:40:47,758;But should I be worried?
551;00:40:47,793;00:40:49,760;Janos Slynt,
551;00:40:47,793;00:40:49,760;Pycelle--
552;00:40:49,795;00:40:53,097;the small council
552;00:40:49,795;00:40:53,097;grows smaller every day.
553;00:40:53,132;00:40:56,000;The council has a reputation
553;00:40:53,132;00:40:56,000;for serving past Hands poorly.
554;00:40:56,034;00:40:59,170;I don't mean to follow
554;00:40:56,034;00:40:59,170;Ned Stark to the grave.
555;00:41:00,205;00:41:03,574;Power is a curious thing,
555;00:41:00,205;00:41:03,574;My Lord.
556;00:41:03,609;00:41:05,743;Are you fond of riddles?
557;00:41:05,778;00:41:07,745;Why, am I about
557;00:41:05,778;00:41:07,745;to hear one?
558;00:41:07,780;00:41:10,214;Three great men
558;00:41:07,780;00:41:10,214;sit in a room.
559;00:41:10,249;00:41:12,851;A king, a priest
559;00:41:10,249;00:41:12,851;and a rich man.
560;00:41:12,885;00:41:15,654;Between them stands
560;00:41:12,885;00:41:15,654;a common Sellsword.
561;00:41:15,688;00:41:19,625;Each great man bids the
561;00:41:15,688;00:41:19,625;Sellsword kill the other two.
562;00:41:19,660;00:41:22,428;Who lives, who dies?
563;00:41:22,463;00:41:24,698;Depends on the Sellsword.
564;00:41:24,732;00:41:26,867;Does it?
564;00:41:24,732;00:41:26,867;He has neither crown
565;00:41:26,901;00:41:29,136;nor gold nor favor
565;00:41:26,901;00:41:29,136;with the Gods.
566;00:41:29,170;00:41:31,405;He has a sword,
566;00:41:29,170;00:41:31,405;the power of life and death.
567;00:41:31,439;00:41:33,574;But if it's swordsmen
567;00:41:31,439;00:41:33,574;who rule,
568;00:41:33,608;00:41:36,110;why do we pretend
568;00:41:33,608;00:41:36,110;Kings hold all the power?
569;00:41:36,144;00:41:38,879;When Ned Stark
569;00:41:36,144;00:41:38,879;lost his head,
570;00:41:38,913;00:41:41,715;who was truly responsible?
571;00:41:41,749;00:41:44,084;Joffrey?
571;00:41:41,749;00:41:44,084;The executioner?
572;00:41:44,118;00:41:45,685;Or something else?
573;00:41:45,720;00:41:48,054;I've decided
573;00:41:45,720;00:41:48,054;I don't like riddles.
574;00:41:50,625;00:41:55,295;Power resides where
574;00:41:50,625;00:41:55,295;men believe it resides.
575;00:41:55,330;00:41:57,197;It's a trick,
576;00:41:57,231;00:41:59,967;a shadow on the wall.
577;00:42:00,001;00:42:03,838;And a very small man
578;00:42:03,872;00:42:06,407;can cast a very large shadow.
579;00:42:46,415;00:42:48,917;You should be sleeping.
580;00:42:48,951;00:42:52,219;Tomorrow's a long march.
581;00:42:52,254;00:42:55,222;30 miles if it
581;00:42:52,254;00:42:55,222;don't piss on us.
582;00:42:56,524;00:42:58,158;I can't sleep.
583;00:43:02,797;00:43:04,697;I don't like the taste.
584;00:43:07,134;00:43:10,369;Well...
585;00:43:10,403;00:43:14,106;You don't drink it
585;00:43:10,403;00:43:14,106;for the flavor, to be honest.
586;00:43:21,747;00:43:23,214;What?
587;00:43:23,248;00:43:26,817;How do you sleep?
588;00:43:26,852;00:43:29,053;Same as most men,
588;00:43:26,852;00:43:29,053;I think.
589;00:43:29,087;00:43:31,755;But you've seen things,
590;00:43:31,789;00:43:35,059;horrible things.
591;00:43:35,093;00:43:37,729;Aye.
592;00:43:37,763;00:43:40,765;I've seen some
592;00:43:37,763;00:43:40,765;pretty things, too,
593;00:43:40,800;00:43:43,035;but not nearly so many.
594;00:43:43,069;00:43:46,473;How do you sleep
594;00:43:43,069;00:43:46,473;when you--
595;00:43:48,676;00:43:53,013;when you have those
595;00:43:48,676;00:43:53,013;things in your head?
596;00:43:54,816;00:43:57,785;You didn't see that.
597;00:43:57,819;00:43:59,387;I made damn sure.
598;00:43:59,421;00:44:01,656;I close my eyes
598;00:43:59,421;00:44:01,656;and I see them up there.
599;00:44:03,125;00:44:05,427;All of them
600;00:44:05,461;00:44:08,063;standing there--
601;00:44:08,098;00:44:10,665;Joffrey,
602;00:44:10,700;00:44:13,268;the Queen,
603;00:44:13,303;00:44:15,670;and--
604;00:44:15,705;00:44:18,106;and my sister.
605;00:44:26,515;00:44:31,018;You know, we've got something
605;00:44:26,515;00:44:31,018;in common, me and you.
606;00:44:31,052;00:44:33,387;You know that?
607;00:44:33,421;00:44:35,957;I must have been
608;00:44:35,991;00:44:38,460;a couple of years
608;00:44:35,991;00:44:38,460;older than you.
609;00:44:40,396;00:44:42,765;I saw my brother stabbed
609;00:44:40,396;00:44:42,765;through the heart
610;00:44:42,800;00:44:44,834;right on our doorstep.
611;00:44:44,868;00:44:48,404;He weren't much of a villain
611;00:44:44,868;00:44:48,404;what skewered him.
612;00:44:48,439;00:44:51,040;Willem, the lad's name was.
613;00:44:53,010;00:44:55,912;He ran off before
613;00:44:53,010;00:44:55,912;anyone could spit.
614;00:44:55,947;00:44:59,149;And I just stood there,
615;00:44:59,183;00:45:01,852;watching my brother die.
616;00:45:03,120;00:45:06,156;But here's the funny part.
617;00:45:06,190;00:45:09,393;I can't picture
617;00:45:06,190;00:45:09,393;my brother's face anymore.
618;00:45:09,427;00:45:12,062;But Willem--
619;00:45:12,097;00:45:15,066;oh, he was
619;00:45:12,097;00:45:15,066;a nice-looking boy.
620;00:45:16,502;00:45:18,869;He had good white teeth,
621;00:45:18,904;00:45:21,206;blue eyes,
622;00:45:21,240;00:45:24,976;one of those dimpled chins
622;00:45:21,240;00:45:24,976;all the girls like.
623;00:45:27,180;00:45:30,215;I would think about him
623;00:45:27,180;00:45:30,215;when I was working,
624;00:45:30,249;00:45:34,319;when I was drinking,
624;00:45:30,249;00:45:34,319;when I was having a shit.
625;00:45:34,353;00:45:36,621;It got to the point
626;00:45:36,656;00:45:39,891;where I would say his name
626;00:45:36,656;00:45:39,891;every night before I went to bed.
627;00:45:39,925;00:45:42,426;Willem. Willem.
628;00:45:42,461;00:45:45,196;Willem.
629;00:45:45,230;00:45:47,398;A prayer almost.
630;00:45:49,167;00:45:51,835;Well, one day...
631;00:45:53,004;00:45:56,907;Willem came riding
631;00:45:53,004;00:45:56,907;back into town.
632;00:45:59,276;00:46:03,113;I buried an ax so deep
632;00:45:59,276;00:46:03,113;into Willem's skull,
633;00:46:03,147;00:46:06,950;they had to bury
633;00:46:03,147;00:46:06,950;him with it.
634;00:46:06,984;00:46:10,287;Willem's horse
634;00:46:06,984;00:46:10,287;got me to the Wall
635;00:46:10,321;00:46:13,089;and I've been wearing
635;00:46:10,321;00:46:13,089;black ever since.
636;00:46:17,095;00:46:19,097;Well...
637;00:46:19,131;00:46:22,100;that'll help you sleep, eh?
638;00:46:28,275;00:46:29,542;Ho!
639;00:46:29,576;00:46:32,745;Get up, you lazy
639;00:46:29,576;00:46:32,745;sons of whores!
640;00:46:32,779;00:46:35,648;Arm yourselves.
641;00:46:35,682;00:46:37,316;Get up.
641;00:46:35,682;00:46:37,316;Get up.
642;00:46:37,351;00:46:39,218;Keep out of sight,
642;00:46:37,351;00:46:39,218;both of you.
643;00:46:39,252;00:46:40,786;No, I'm not afraid.
643;00:46:39,252;00:46:40,786;I can fight.
644;00:46:40,820;00:46:43,055;Keep out of sight.
645;00:46:43,089;00:46:45,657;If things go wrong,
645;00:46:43,089;00:46:45,657;you run.
646;00:46:45,691;00:46:46,920;Do you hear me?
647;00:46:46,945;00:46:49,627;You run along North
647;00:46:46,945;00:46:49,627;and don't look back.
648;00:46:49,862;00:46:52,397;Hey, there's men
648;00:46:49,862;00:46:52,397;out there
649;00:46:52,431;00:46:54,667;who want to fuck
649;00:46:52,431;00:46:54,667;your corpses.
650;00:46:54,701;00:46:57,369;Outside, now!
651;00:46:58,572;00:47:00,640;Come on, move, move!
652;00:47:02,476;00:47:04,111;Gold Cloaks!
653;00:47:10,052;00:47:11,953;Everyone out!
654;00:47:15,758;00:47:19,594;Hey, you!
654;00:47:15,758;00:47:19,594;Open the damn cage!
655;00:47:23,133;00:47:24,934;Where's the bastard, Crow?
656;00:47:24,968;00:47:27,738;Got more than a few bastards here.
656;00:47:24,968;00:47:27,738;Who's asking?
657;00:47:27,772;00:47:30,507;Ser Amory Lorch, sworn Bannerman
657;00:47:27,772;00:47:30,507;to Lord Tywin Lannister.
658;00:47:30,542;00:47:34,711;These men from the capital
658;00:47:30,542;00:47:34,711;requested our assistance.
659;00:47:34,745;00:47:36,612;Drop your weapons
659;00:47:34,745;00:47:36,612;in the name of the King.
660;00:47:36,647;00:47:38,681;Now, which King
660;00:47:36,647;00:47:38,681;would that be?
661;00:47:38,715;00:47:40,616;This is your last chance.
662;00:47:40,650;00:47:43,351;In the name
662;00:47:40,650;00:47:43,351;of King Joffrey,
663;00:47:43,385;00:47:45,620;drop your weapons.
664;00:47:47,389;00:47:51,091;I don't think I will.
665;00:47:51,125;00:47:53,293;So be it.
666;00:47:55,997;00:47:59,533;I always hated crossbows.
666;00:47:55,997;00:47:59,533;Take too long to load.
667;00:48:37,341;00:48:39,475;Boy, come here.
667;00:48:37,341;00:48:39,475;Boy!
668;00:48:39,509;00:48:43,045;Sweet boy, help us.
668;00:48:39,509;00:48:43,045;Come back here!
669;00:48:43,079;00:48:44,346;Help us, boy!
670;00:48:48,184;00:48:50,919;A man can fight!
670;00:48:48,184;00:48:50,919;Free us!
671;00:48:57,393;00:48:59,895;Quick, give it to me.
672;00:49:01,531;00:49:04,099;Give me the ax.
672;00:49:01,531;00:49:04,099;Give me that.
673;00:49:12,475;00:49:14,108;Put 'em on the wagon!
674;00:49:14,143;00:49:16,110;There's more here.
674;00:49:14,143;00:49:16,110;Come on.
675;00:49:21,383;00:49:24,885;What do we have here?
676;00:49:24,919;00:49:26,886;No!
677;00:49:26,921;00:49:30,356;That's a fine
677;00:49:26,921;00:49:30,356;little blade.
678;00:49:30,391;00:49:32,792;Maybe I'll pick
678;00:49:30,391;00:49:32,792;my teeth with it.
679;00:49:32,826;00:49:34,627;I yield!
679;00:49:32,826;00:49:34,627;I yield!
680;00:49:34,662;00:49:36,897;Round up any survivors.
681;00:49:36,931;00:49:38,999;We'll take them back
681;00:49:36,931;00:49:38,999;to Harrenhal.
682;00:49:39,033;00:49:42,170;You heard him.
682;00:49:39,033;00:49:42,170;You're coming with us.
683;00:49:42,204;00:49:44,706;I yield!
684;00:49:49,078;00:49:51,080;Help!
685;00:49:51,114;00:49:53,216;Help me!
686;00:49:56,753;00:49:58,454;Something wrong
686;00:49:56,753;00:49:58,454;with your leg, boy?
687;00:49:58,489;00:50:00,490;Look at it.
688;00:50:08,332;00:50:09,966;Can you walk?
689;00:50:10,000;00:50:12,735;No.
689;00:50:10,000;00:50:12,735;You got to carry me.
690;00:50:13,771;00:50:15,939;All right.
691;00:50:29,254;00:50:31,789;Carry him, he says.
692;00:50:40,365;00:50:42,766;We're looking for
692;00:50:40,365;00:50:42,766;a bastard named Gendry.
693;00:50:42,801;00:50:45,803;Give him up
694;00:50:45,837;00:50:48,105;or I'll start
694;00:50:45,837;00:50:48,105;taking eyeballs.
695;00:51:00,519;00:51:02,186;You want Gendry?
696;00:51:05,624;00:51:07,925;You already got him.
697;00:51:12,096;00:51:14,598;He loved that helmet.
