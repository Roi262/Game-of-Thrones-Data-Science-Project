4;00:02:09,861;00:02:12,563;Gotta be ready
4;00:02:09,861;00:02:12,563;before nightfall.
5;00:02:13,565;00:02:15,966;Okay, keep moving.
6;00:02:20,038;00:02:22,073;Put a watch
6;00:02:20,038;00:02:22,073;on the Ridge
7;00:02:22,107;00:02:24,275;and the tree lines.
8;00:02:26,012;00:02:28,013;Boy.
9;00:02:28,047;00:02:30,449;Lovely boy.
10;00:02:30,483;00:02:32,251;What do you want?
11;00:02:32,285;00:02:33,819;A man has a thirst.
12;00:02:33,853;00:02:36,989;A man does not drink
12;00:02:33,853;00:02:36,989;for a day and a night.
13;00:02:37,023;00:02:39,090;A boy could
13;00:02:37,023;00:02:39,090;make a friend.
14;00:02:39,125;00:02:41,492;I have friends.
15;00:02:41,526;00:02:43,728;Give us beer
15;00:02:41,526;00:02:43,728;before I skin you.
16;00:02:44,830;00:02:46,831;A man does not choose
16;00:02:44,830;00:02:46,831;his companions.
17;00:02:46,865;00:02:48,766;These two, they have
17;00:02:46,865;00:02:48,766;no courtesy.
18;00:02:48,800;00:02:51,135;A man must ask
18;00:02:48,800;00:02:51,135;forgiveness.
19;00:02:53,572;00:02:56,006;You're called Arry?
20;00:02:58,143;00:03:01,379;This man has the honor
20;00:02:58,143;00:03:01,379;to be Jaqen H'ghar,

22;00:03:02,948;00:03:04,583;Beer, you little shit.
23;00:03:04,617;00:03:07,152;Get us beer!
24;00:03:07,186;00:03:08,954;You should have
24;00:03:07,186;00:03:08,954;asked nicely.
25;00:03:09,021;00:03:10,122;Aah!
26;00:03:14,761;00:03:17,364;Come closer
26;00:03:14,761;00:03:17,364;and I'll shove that stick
27;00:03:17,398;00:03:20,067;up your bunghole
27;00:03:17,398;00:03:20,067;and fuck you bloody.
28;00:03:20,101;00:03:22,636;A boy has more courage
28;00:03:20,101;00:03:22,636;than sense.
29;00:03:22,671;00:03:24,238;Come here!
30;00:03:24,272;00:03:25,973;Yoren said none of us
30;00:03:24,272;00:03:25,973;were to go near those three.
31;00:03:26,007;00:03:28,075;Come here!
31;00:03:26,007;00:03:28,075;They don't scare me.
32;00:03:28,110;00:03:30,177;Hmm?
32;00:03:28,110;00:03:30,177;Then you're stupid.
33;00:03:30,212;00:03:32,079;They scare me.
34;00:03:36,250;00:03:39,185;What are Gold Cloaks doing so
34;00:03:36,250;00:03:39,185;far from King's Landing?
35;00:03:44,323;00:03:46,858;What are you doing?
35;00:03:44,323;00:03:46,858;They're looking for me.
36;00:03:46,893;00:03:49,794;You in command here?
37;00:03:49,829;00:03:52,764;You're a long way
37;00:03:49,829;00:03:52,764;from home.
38;00:03:52,799;00:03:54,900;I asked you a question.
39;00:03:54,934;00:03:56,702;Aye, you did.
40;00:03:57,704;00:03:59,806;You asked
40;00:03:57,704;00:03:59,806;without manners
41;00:03:59,840;00:04:02,409;and I chose not to answer.
42;00:04:02,443;00:04:05,479;I have a royal warrant
43;00:04:05,514;00:04:09,150;for one of these gutter rats
43;00:04:05,514;00:04:09,150;you're transporting.
44;00:04:11,621;00:04:14,656;Well, the thing is...
45;00:04:14,690;00:04:16,958;These gutter rats belong
45;00:04:14,690;00:04:16,958;to the Night's Watch.
46;00:04:16,993;00:04:20,762;Now, that puts them beyond the
46;00:04:16,993;00:04:20,762;reach of Kings and Queens.
47;00:04:20,797;00:04:22,631;Does it?
48;00:04:23,466;00:04:25,033;It's a funny thing--
49;00:04:25,067;00:04:27,202;people worry so much
49;00:04:25,067;00:04:27,202;about their throats
50;00:04:27,237;00:04:30,606;that they forget
50;00:04:27,237;00:04:30,606;about what's down low.
51;00:04:30,640;00:04:34,844;Now I sharpened this blade
51;00:04:30,640;00:04:34,844;before breakfast.
52;00:04:34,878;00:04:39,248;I could shave a spider's arse
52;00:04:34,878;00:04:39,248;if I wanted to
53;00:04:39,283;00:04:43,253;or I could nick
53;00:04:39,283;00:04:43,253;this artery in your leg.
54;00:04:43,287;00:04:45,856;And once it's nicked,
54;00:04:43,287;00:04:45,856;there's no one around here
55;00:04:45,890;00:04:48,959;who knows
55;00:04:45,890;00:04:48,959;how to unnick it.
56;00:04:49,027;00:04:51,795;We'll just keep that.
57;00:04:53,064;00:04:56,834;Good steel is always
57;00:04:53,064;00:04:56,834;needed on the Wall.
58;00:04:56,868;00:04:58,568;Seems you have
58;00:04:56,868;00:04:58,568;a choice--
59;00:04:58,603;00:05:02,806;you can die here at this crossroads
59;00:04:58,603;00:05:02,806;a long way from home,
60;00:05:02,840;00:05:05,675;or you can go back to your city
60;00:05:02,840;00:05:05,675;and tell your Masters
61;00:05:05,709;00:05:08,711;you didn't find
61;00:05:05,709;00:05:08,711;what you were looking for.
62;00:05:14,485;00:05:16,553;We're looking
62;00:05:14,485;00:05:16,553;for a boy named Gendry.
63;00:05:16,588;00:05:20,157;He carries
63;00:05:16,588;00:05:20,157;a bull's head helmet.
64;00:05:20,191;00:05:24,195;Anyone turning him over
64;00:05:20,191;00:05:24,195;will earn the King's reward.
65;00:05:24,229;00:05:27,198;We'll be back
65;00:05:24,229;00:05:27,198;with more men
66;00:05:27,232;00:05:30,067;and I'll be taking your head
66;00:05:27,232;00:05:30,067;home along with that bastard boy.
67;00:05:59,196;00:06:01,697;( Distant seagulls
68;00:06:05,702;00:06:07,170;My Lord.
69;00:06:07,204;00:06:09,171;You make me wait
69;00:06:07,204;00:06:09,171;a long time,
70;00:06:09,206;00:06:11,441;but your friend
70;00:06:09,206;00:06:11,441;keeps me company.
71;00:06:11,475;00:06:14,544;We were just speaking
71;00:06:11,475;00:06:14,544;of your bravery
72;00:06:14,578;00:06:17,981;in the victory against
72;00:06:14,578;00:06:17,981;the Stark auxiliary forces.
73;00:06:18,049;00:06:21,418;It was quite a battle.
74;00:06:21,452;00:06:24,921;I heard you suffered
74;00:06:21,452;00:06:24,921;a terrible head wound.
75;00:06:24,956;00:06:27,891;The northerners
75;00:06:24,956;00:06:27,891;are such fearsome warriors.
76;00:06:27,926;00:06:30,528;And I tell him
76;00:06:27,926;00:06:30,528;the story of how we meet.
77;00:06:31,530;00:06:33,597;To find so lovely
77;00:06:31,530;00:06:33,597;a creature
78;00:06:33,632;00:06:35,433;working in your
78;00:06:33,632;00:06:35,433;father's kitchens--
79;00:06:35,467;00:06:37,702;it almost beggars belief.
80;00:06:38,838;00:06:40,773;Strange things do happen.
81;00:06:40,807;00:06:43,576;You should taste
81;00:06:40,807;00:06:43,576;her fish pie.
82;00:06:43,610;00:06:45,945;I don't think Lord Varys
82;00:06:43,610;00:06:45,945;likes fish pie.
83;00:06:45,979;00:06:48,948;How can you tell?
83;00:06:45,979;00:06:48,948;I can always tell.
84;00:06:48,983;00:06:51,184;Men like Lord Varys
84;00:06:48,983;00:06:51,184;and I can't let
85;00:06:51,218;00:06:53,386;our disadvantages
85;00:06:51,218;00:06:53,386;get the best of us.
86;00:06:53,420;00:06:56,288;We'll make a fisherman
86;00:06:53,420;00:06:56,288;of him yet.
87;00:06:56,322;00:06:58,189;I am glad
87;00:06:56,322;00:06:58,189;your new friend
88;00:06:58,224;00:07:01,325;was able to accompany you
88;00:06:58,224;00:07:01,325;to the capital.
89;00:07:01,360;00:07:05,429;Friends are such
89;00:07:01,360;00:07:05,429;an important part of life.
90;00:07:05,463;00:07:07,931;Unfortunate that your father
90;00:07:05,463;00:07:07,931;didn't want her to come.
91;00:07:07,966;00:07:10,500;But rest easy, My Lord.
92;00:07:10,535;00:07:13,504;I am very good
92;00:07:10,535;00:07:13,504;at keeping secrets
93;00:07:13,538;00:07:15,739;for my good friends.
94;00:07:15,773;00:07:18,242;Your discretion
94;00:07:15,773;00:07:18,242;is legendary...
95;00:07:18,276;00:07:19,676;where your friends
95;00:07:18,276;00:07:19,676;are concerned.
96;00:07:19,711;00:07:22,179;How unspeakable of me
96;00:07:19,711;00:07:22,179;to go on and on
97;00:07:22,213;00:07:24,448;when all you want
97;00:07:22,213;00:07:24,448;to do is rest.
98;00:07:24,482;00:07:26,617;I will leave you.
99;00:07:28,020;00:07:29,787;Welcome to King's Landing,
99;00:07:28,020;00:07:29,787;my dear.
100;00:07:29,822;00:07:33,258;This city is made brighter
100;00:07:29,822;00:07:33,258;by your presence.
101;00:07:33,292;00:07:35,627;We have a council meeting,
101;00:07:33,292;00:07:35,627;My Lord.
102;00:07:39,198;00:07:41,466;I don't like threats.
103;00:07:41,501;00:07:43,769;Who threatened you?
103;00:07:41,501;00:07:43,769;I'm not Ned Stark.
104;00:07:43,803;00:07:45,937;I understand the way
104;00:07:43,803;00:07:45,937;this game is played.
105;00:07:45,972;00:07:47,572;Ned Stark
105;00:07:45,972;00:07:47,572;was a man of honor.
106;00:07:47,607;00:07:49,040;And I am not.
107;00:07:49,075;00:07:52,577;Threaten me again and I'll have
107;00:07:49,075;00:07:52,577;you thrown into the sea.
108;00:07:55,615;00:07:58,016;You might be disappointed
108;00:07:55,615;00:07:58,016;in the results.
109;00:07:58,050;00:08:01,019;Storms come and go,
110;00:08:01,053;00:08:03,221;the big fish eat
110;00:08:01,053;00:08:03,221;the little fish,
111;00:08:03,255;00:08:06,290;and I keep on paddling.
112;00:08:07,326;00:08:08,726;Come, My Lord.
113;00:08:08,760;00:08:11,128;We shouldn't keep
113;00:08:08,760;00:08:11,128;the queen waiting.
114;00:08:17,334;00:08:19,168;From this time
114;00:08:17,334;00:08:19,168;until the end of time,
115;00:08:19,202;00:08:21,036;we are not part
115;00:08:19,202;00:08:21,036;of your realm,
116;00:08:21,104;00:08:24,940;but a free and independent
116;00:08:21,104;00:08:24,940;kingdom of the North.
117;00:08:28,610;00:08:31,145;He has more spirit than
117;00:08:28,610;00:08:31,145;his father, I'll give him that.
118;00:08:31,179;00:08:34,482;You've perfected the art
118;00:08:31,179;00:08:34,482;of tearing up papers.
119;00:08:34,516;00:08:37,018;We can give him his father's bones
119;00:08:34,516;00:08:37,018;back at least
120;00:08:37,052;00:08:38,753;as a gesture
120;00:08:37,052;00:08:38,753;of good faith.
121;00:08:38,787;00:08:40,822;You'll give the Starks
121;00:08:38,787;00:08:40,822;our reply, cousin?
122;00:08:41,757;00:08:43,925;I will, Your Grace.
123;00:08:43,960;00:08:45,561;Did you see my brother
124;00:08:45,595;00:08:46,996;when you were
124;00:08:45,595;00:08:46,996;the Starks' guest?
125;00:08:47,030;00:08:48,931;I did.
126;00:08:48,966;00:08:51,667;They have not broken
126;00:08:48,966;00:08:51,667;his spirit, Your Grace.
127;00:08:52,536;00:08:55,404;If you speak with him,
128;00:08:55,439;00:08:58,340;tell him he's not
128;00:08:55,439;00:08:58,340;been forgotten.
129;00:08:58,375;00:09:00,709;I will, Your Grace.
129;00:08:58,375;00:09:00,709;Safe travels, cousin.
130;00:09:05,048;00:09:07,349;You have a deft hand
130;00:09:05,048;00:09:07,349;with diplomacy.
131;00:09:07,384;00:09:11,620;If that's everything...
131;00:09:07,384;00:09:11,620;A-- a raven flew in this morning
132;00:09:11,654;00:09:14,523;from Castle Black.
133;00:09:14,557;00:09:16,158;Trouble with
133;00:09:14,557;00:09:16,158;the wildlings.
134;00:09:16,192;00:09:18,660;That's why they're
134;00:09:16,192;00:09:18,660;called wildlings.
135;00:09:18,695;00:09:21,329;Somewhat less wild
135;00:09:18,695;00:09:21,329;these days.
136;00:09:21,364;00:09:23,165;Seems they've stopped
136;00:09:21,364;00:09:23,165;killing each other
137;00:09:23,199;00:09:26,302;and started following
137;00:09:23,199;00:09:26,302;this King-Beyond-the-Wall.
138;00:09:26,336;00:09:29,138;Another king?
138;00:09:26,336;00:09:29,138;How many is that now, five?
139;00:09:29,173;00:09:30,940;I've lost count.
140;00:09:30,974;00:09:34,777;The Lord Commander asks that we
140;00:09:30,974;00:09:34,777;send more men to man the Wall.
141;00:09:34,812;00:09:36,479;Perhaps he's forgotten
141;00:09:34,812;00:09:36,479;we're fighting a war.
142;00:09:36,513;00:09:38,481;We have no men to spare.
143;00:09:38,516;00:09:40,217;The cold winds
143;00:09:38,516;00:09:40,217;are rising
144;00:09:40,251;00:09:42,820;and the dead rise
144;00:09:40,251;00:09:42,820;with them.
145;00:09:42,854;00:09:46,457;The northerners are
145;00:09:42,854;00:09:46,457;a superstitious people.
146;00:09:46,491;00:09:48,559;According to the Commander,
146;00:09:46,491;00:09:48,559;one of these dead men
147;00:09:48,594;00:09:50,629;attacked him
147;00:09:48,594;00:09:50,629;in his chambers.
148;00:09:50,663;00:09:52,664;Mormont doesn't lie.
149;00:09:52,698;00:09:55,334;How do you kill
149;00:09:52,698;00:09:55,334;a dead man?
150;00:09:56,302;00:09:58,303;Apparently you burn him.
151;00:09:59,539;00:10:01,273;One trip to the Wall
151;00:09:59,539;00:10:01,273;and you come back
152;00:10:01,307;00:10:04,643;believing in grumpkins
152;00:10:01,307;00:10:04,643;and snarks.
153;00:10:05,611;00:10:08,213;I don't know
153;00:10:05,611;00:10:08,213;what I believe,
154;00:10:08,247;00:10:10,314;but here's
154;00:10:08,247;00:10:10,314;a fact for you--
155;00:10:10,349;00:10:11,949;the Night's Watch
155;00:10:10,349;00:10:11,949;is the only thing
156;00:10:11,983;00:10:14,651;that separates us from
156;00:10:11,983;00:10:14,651;what lies beyond the Wall.
157;00:10:14,686;00:10:17,087;I have every confidence
157;00:10:14,686;00:10:17,087;that the brave men
158;00:10:17,122;00:10:19,824;of the Night's Watch
158;00:10:17,122;00:10:19,824;will protect us all.
159;00:10:21,426;00:10:23,027;And I said,
160;00:10:23,061;00:10:24,728;if the Gods wanted us
160;00:10:23,061;00:10:24,728;to have dignity,
161;00:10:24,763;00:10:27,631;they wouldn't make us
161;00:10:24,763;00:10:27,631;fart when we died.
162;00:10:28,900;00:10:31,367;We fart when we die?
163;00:10:31,402;00:10:33,336;My blessed mother--
164;00:10:33,370;00:10:35,438;I was holding her hand
164;00:10:33,370;00:10:35,438;when she left this world.
165;00:10:35,472;00:10:39,041;She farted so hard,
165;00:10:35,472;00:10:39,041;the whole bed shook.
166;00:10:48,851;00:10:52,153;Seems a bit greedy for one man
166;00:10:48,851;00:10:52,153;to have so many wives.
167;00:10:52,188;00:10:54,656;Wouldn't two or three
167;00:10:52,188;00:10:54,656;be enough for him?
168;00:10:54,691;00:10:57,593;We were having
168;00:10:54,691;00:10:57,593;a serious discussion.
169;00:10:58,729;00:11:00,830;Would you look at that?
170;00:11:02,166;00:11:05,069;Nothing like the sight
170;00:11:02,166;00:11:05,069;of a woman walking away.
171;00:11:05,103;00:11:07,972;I prefer watching them
171;00:11:05,103;00:11:07,972;come towards me.
172;00:11:08,006;00:11:09,607;I'm sure
172;00:11:08,006;00:11:09,607;that's nice, too.
173;00:11:09,641;00:11:12,776;Yeah, well, there was
173;00:11:09,641;00:11:12,776;a milkmaid named Violet
174;00:11:12,810;00:11:15,379;on the next farm over
174;00:11:12,810;00:11:15,379;from where I grew up.
175;00:11:15,413;00:11:18,381;We were wrestling together
175;00:11:15,413;00:11:18,381;from the time we were six years old.
176;00:11:18,416;00:11:23,386;And then we got older
176;00:11:18,416;00:11:23,386;and the wrestling, uh...
177;00:11:24,388;00:11:26,622;Changed.
178;00:11:26,656;00:11:28,490;You were with her?
179;00:11:29,525;00:11:31,126;How many times?
180;00:11:31,160;00:11:33,662;Well, as many times
180;00:11:31,160;00:11:33,662;as I could.
181;00:11:36,866;00:11:39,468;I wish I grew up
181;00:11:36,866;00:11:39,468;on a farm.
182;00:11:39,503;00:11:40,837;We need more potatoes.
183;00:11:40,871;00:11:43,239;Get another sack
183;00:11:40,871;00:11:43,239;from the sledge.
184;00:11:46,477;00:11:48,745;Get the turnips, too.
185;00:12:00,157;00:12:03,759;No. Ghost, no.
186;00:12:03,793;00:12:06,228;No!
187;00:12:06,262;00:12:08,830;Ghost, away.
187;00:12:06,262;00:12:08,830;Shoo, shoo!
188;00:12:12,935;00:12:14,736;You all right?
189;00:12:14,771;00:12:17,573;Did he frighten you?
189;00:12:14,771;00:12:17,573;You-- you shouldn't touch me.
190;00:12:17,607;00:12:21,177;Oh. Oh, right.
191;00:12:21,211;00:12:22,846;I'm sorry.
192;00:12:22,880;00:12:25,649;I just wanted to make sure
192;00:12:22,880;00:12:25,649;you weren't hurt.
193;00:12:31,691;00:12:33,691;You're very brave.
194;00:12:44,035;00:12:46,036;What are you doing?
195;00:12:46,070;00:12:47,870;This is Gilly.
196;00:12:47,905;00:12:50,306;She's one of Craster's...
196;00:12:47,905;00:12:50,306;daughters.
197;00:12:50,655;00:12:52,189;Hello, Gilly.
197;00:12:50,655;00:12:52,189;What are you doing?
198;00:12:52,247;00:12:53,882;Sam said
198;00:12:52,247;00:12:53,882;you could help.
199;00:12:53,945;00:12:55,551;I'm sorry, but Sam knows
199;00:12:53,945;00:12:55,551;we're not supposed--
200;00:12:55,576;00:12:56,776;She's pregnant.
201;00:13:03,822;00:13:07,092;Have to take her
201;00:13:03,822;00:13:07,092;with us when we leave.
202;00:13:07,126;00:13:08,927;What?
203;00:13:08,961;00:13:10,762;What would that--
203;00:13:08,961;00:13:10,762;I know it sounds a bit mad.
204;00:13:10,797;00:13:12,530;No, it doesn't sound a bit mad,
204;00:13:10,797;00:13:12,530;it's impossible.
205;00:13:12,565;00:13:14,899;The Lord Commander ordered us to--
205;00:13:12,565;00:13:14,899;We are sworn to protect.
206;00:13:14,933;00:13:17,501;Sam, we can't take--
206;00:13:14,933;00:13:17,501;please, ser, please.
207;00:13:17,536;00:13:19,436;I can still run
207;00:13:17,536;00:13:19,436;if I have to.
208;00:13:19,471;00:13:21,872;It's just not possible.
208;00:13:19,471;00:13:21,872;I'm going to have a baby.
209;00:13:21,906;00:13:24,474;If it's a boy...
210;00:13:24,508;00:13:26,442;If it's a boy, what?
211;00:13:31,548;00:13:33,816;You want us to risk
211;00:13:31,548;00:13:33,816;our lives for you
212;00:13:33,850;00:13:35,952;and you won't even
212;00:13:33,850;00:13:35,952;tell us why?
213;00:13:41,591;00:13:44,594;Why'd you do that?
213;00:13:41,591;00:13:44,594;Do what? Ask her a question?
214;00:13:44,628;00:13:46,429;You were cruel.
214;00:13:44,628;00:13:46,429;Cruel?
215;00:13:46,464;00:13:48,431;Sam, are you in such a hurry
215;00:13:46,464;00:13:48,431;to lose a hand?
216;00:13:48,466;00:13:50,800;I didn't touch her.
216;00:13:48,466;00:13:50,800;No, you just want to steal her.
217;00:13:50,834;00:13:52,569;What do you think
217;00:13:50,834;00:13:52,569;Craster cuts off for that?
218;00:13:52,603;00:13:54,604;I can't steal her.
219;00:13:54,638;00:13:56,906;She's a person,
219;00:13:54,638;00:13:56,906;not a goat.
220;00:14:01,345;00:14:05,282;We're heading deeper and deeper
220;00:14:01,345;00:14:05,282;into wildling territory.
221;00:14:05,316;00:14:08,119;We can't take a girl with us.
221;00:14:05,316;00:14:08,119;Mormont wouldn't have it.
222;00:14:08,153;00:14:11,055;And even if he would,
222;00:14:08,153;00:14:11,055;what would we do with her?
223;00:14:11,089;00:14:12,957;Who's going to
223;00:14:11,089;00:14:12,957;deliver a baby, you?
224;00:14:14,160;00:14:16,161;I could try.
225;00:14:16,196;00:14:19,130;What?
225;00:14:16,196;00:14:19,130;I've read about it.
226;00:14:19,165;00:14:21,766;A bit.
227;00:14:23,202;00:14:25,571;I'm sorry, Sam.
228;00:14:25,605;00:14:27,506;We can't help her.
229;00:15:22,965;00:15:26,134;Khaleesi.
230;00:16:10,214;00:16:13,116;You don't need to see this.
230;00:16:10,214;00:16:13,116;He is blood of my blood.
231;00:16:16,888;00:16:19,890;Who did this?
231;00:16:16,888;00:16:19,890;Khal Pono, perhaps.
232;00:16:19,924;00:16:22,259;Khal Jhaqo.
233;00:16:22,293;00:16:25,362;They don't like the idea of a woman
233;00:16:22,293;00:16:25,362;leading a Khalasar.
234;00:16:25,397;00:16:28,631;They will like it far less
234;00:16:25,397;00:16:28,631;when I am done with them.
235;00:18:01,058;00:18:02,725;Is it as you remember,
235;00:18:01,058;00:18:02,725;My Lord?
236;00:18:02,759;00:18:04,960;It looks smaller.
237;00:18:04,994;00:18:06,828;Everything looks bigger
237;00:18:04,994;00:18:06,828;when you're a child.
238;00:18:06,862;00:18:08,763;I remember
238;00:18:06,862;00:18:08,763;my father's cabin
239;00:18:08,797;00:18:10,598;felt like a palace
239;00:18:08,797;00:18:10,598;when I was little.
240;00:18:10,632;00:18:14,135;Now look at it.
241;00:18:14,169;00:18:16,437;They'll be waiting
241;00:18:14,169;00:18:16,437;for me on the docks.
242;00:18:16,471;00:18:18,239;Who will?
243;00:18:18,273;00:18:20,107;Anyone who matters.
244;00:18:20,141;00:18:22,309;This is a big day for them.
245;00:18:22,344;00:18:25,846;They haven't had much to get
245;00:18:22,344;00:18:25,846;excited about since I left.
246;00:18:25,880;00:18:27,948;It's a hard place,
246;00:18:25,880;00:18:27,948;the Iron Islands.
247;00:18:27,983;00:18:29,517;Always has been.
248;00:18:29,551;00:18:31,786;It's cold and it's wet.
249;00:18:31,821;00:18:33,555;Oh, I love
249;00:18:31,821;00:18:33,555;the cold and wet.
250;00:18:33,589;00:18:36,157;They say hard places
250;00:18:33,589;00:18:36,157;breed hard men.
251;00:18:37,860;00:18:40,395;And hard men
251;00:18:37,860;00:18:40,395;rule the world.
252;00:18:41,563;00:18:44,899;Then you'll be king
252;00:18:41,563;00:18:44,899;before long.
253;00:18:47,202;00:18:50,705;Try smiling with
253;00:18:47,202;00:18:50,705;your lips closed.
254;00:18:50,739;00:18:52,873;Better.
255;00:18:55,277;00:18:58,212;My father doesn't trust
255;00:18:55,277;00:18:58,212;you Iron islanders.
256;00:18:58,246;00:19:00,214;I don't blame him.
257;00:19:00,248;00:19:03,251;He says that you're all
257;00:19:00,248;00:19:03,251;reavers and rapers
258;00:19:03,285;00:19:05,119;and that no matter
258;00:19:03,285;00:19:05,119;how many women you have,
259;00:19:05,153;00:19:07,154;you'll never be sat-- uh!
260;00:19:07,189;00:19:10,457;Quit talking about your father.
261;00:19:10,492;00:19:13,294;But he's right
261;00:19:10,492;00:19:13,294;about us.
262;00:19:13,328;00:19:17,030;Our wives from the Iron Islands,
262;00:19:13,328;00:19:17,030;they're for breeding.
263;00:19:17,065;00:19:19,433;That's not enough for us.
264;00:19:19,467;00:19:21,935;That's why
264;00:19:19,467;00:19:21,935;we take salt wives--
265;00:19:21,970;00:19:23,537;the women we capture.
266;00:19:23,572;00:19:25,072;Capture me.
267;00:19:25,107;00:19:27,207;Take me with you
267;00:19:25,107;00:19:27,207;when you go ashore.
268;00:19:27,242;00:19:31,379;Make me your salt wife.
268;00:19:27,242;00:19:31,379;Your place is on this ship.
269;00:19:31,413;00:19:33,547;Not after you leave.
270;00:19:33,582;00:19:35,916;Father will punish me.
271;00:19:35,951;00:19:37,551;He'll call me a whore.
272;00:19:38,620;00:19:41,122;I haven't paid you.
273;00:19:53,036;00:19:55,704;Oh, yeah.
274;00:20:04,915;00:20:07,850;- I paid good money...
275;00:20:17,327;00:20:19,695;I'm not going to stand for this.
276;00:20:19,730;00:20:21,430;I barely touched her.
277;00:20:21,465;00:20:23,666;Now, you charge twice as much
277;00:20:21,465;00:20:23,666;as every other brothel
278;00:20:23,700;00:20:25,567;and this is
278;00:20:23,700;00:20:25,567;what I get-- crying.
279;00:20:25,602;00:20:27,937;One moment, my friend.
279;00:20:25,602;00:20:27,937;A moment.
280;00:20:36,580;00:20:39,649;Please accept
280;00:20:36,580;00:20:39,649;my sincerest apologies.
281;00:20:39,683;00:20:42,051;Aremca will take
281;00:20:39,683;00:20:42,051;good care of you.
282;00:21:11,782;00:21:16,586;I'm sorry, My Lord.
282;00:21:11,782;00:21:16,586;Shh, shh.
283;00:21:17,655;00:21:19,656;Did he hurt you?
284;00:21:20,992;00:21:23,794;No, My Lord.
285;00:21:23,828;00:21:26,597;It's Mhaegen.
286;00:21:26,631;00:21:28,999;Who?
287;00:21:29,034;00:21:32,737;She works for you.
288;00:21:32,771;00:21:36,374;She's the one--
288;00:21:32,771;00:21:36,374;the Gold Cloaks,
289;00:21:36,408;00:21:38,709;they killed her baby.
289;00:21:36,408;00:21:38,709;Ah, yes.
290;00:21:38,744;00:21:41,412;That was...
291;00:21:41,446;00:21:43,648;poorly handled.
292;00:21:45,050;00:21:47,319;Sometimes those
292;00:21:45,050;00:21:47,319;with the most power
293;00:21:47,353;00:21:50,055;have the least grace.
294;00:21:50,089;00:21:53,659;I can't stop
294;00:21:50,089;00:21:53,659;thinking about it.
295;00:21:53,693;00:21:55,795;I can't sleep.
296;00:21:57,497;00:22:00,299;That poor little baby.
297;00:22:00,333;00:22:03,135;You know, you remind me
297;00:22:00,333;00:22:03,135;of another girl,
298;00:22:03,169;00:22:05,204;a lovely thing
298;00:22:03,169;00:22:05,204;I once acquired
299;00:22:05,238;00:22:08,240;from a Lysene
299;00:22:05,238;00:22:08,240;pleasure house--
300;00:22:08,275;00:22:11,410;beautiful, like yourself,
301;00:22:11,444;00:22:14,980;and intelligent,
301;00:22:11,444;00:22:14,980;like yourself.
302;00:22:15,015;00:22:17,883;But she wasn't happy.
303;00:22:18,952;00:22:22,288;She cried often.
304;00:22:22,322;00:22:26,425;I asked her why,
304;00:22:22,322;00:22:26,425;but we didn't have
305;00:22:26,460;00:22:29,329;the kind of rapport
305;00:22:26,460;00:22:29,329;that you and I have.
306;00:22:32,634;00:22:35,268;Yes, it was quite sad.
307;00:22:36,938;00:22:40,274;Girls from the Lysene
307;00:22:36,938;00:22:40,274;pleasure houses are expensive,
308;00:22:40,308;00:22:42,443;extremely expensive.
309;00:22:42,477;00:22:46,114;And this one wasn't
309;00:22:42,477;00:22:46,114;making me any money.
310;00:22:49,785;00:22:52,887;I hate bad investments.
311;00:22:52,921;00:22:55,956;Really, I-- I do.
312;00:22:55,990;00:22:58,025;They haunt me.
313;00:23:01,530;00:23:05,132;I had no idea
313;00:23:01,530;00:23:05,132;how to make her happy,
314;00:23:05,166;00:23:08,234;no idea how
314;00:23:05,166;00:23:08,234;to mitigate my losses.
315;00:23:09,603;00:23:11,871;A very wealthy patron,
315;00:23:09,603;00:23:11,871;he offered me
316;00:23:11,905;00:23:13,506;a tremendous
316;00:23:11,905;00:23:13,506;amount of money
317;00:23:13,540;00:23:18,511;to let him transform
317;00:23:13,540;00:23:18,511;this lovely, sad girl.
318;00:23:18,546;00:23:22,315;To use her
318;00:23:18,546;00:23:22,315;in ways that...
319;00:23:22,350;00:23:25,085;Would never occur
319;00:23:22,350;00:23:25,085;to most men.
320;00:23:26,354;00:23:29,489;And you know what
320;00:23:26,354;00:23:29,489;occurs to most men.
321;00:23:32,727;00:23:37,564;I would not say he succeeded in
321;00:23:32,727;00:23:37,564;making her happy,
322;00:23:37,598;00:23:42,202;but my losses were
322;00:23:37,598;00:23:42,202;definitely mitigated.
323;00:23:49,977;00:23:52,145;Take tonight off
323;00:23:49,977;00:23:52,145;to mourn Mhaegen's child.
324;00:23:53,714;00:23:55,615;I'll see you tomorrow.
325;00:23:55,649;00:23:58,418;And you'll be happy?
326;00:24:01,856;00:24:03,924;That makes me happy.
327;00:24:15,736;00:24:17,370;More wine?
328;00:24:18,706;00:24:20,406;Damn it, boy!
328;00:24:18,706;00:24:20,406;Apologies, My Lord.
329;00:24:20,441;00:24:24,477;Leave us, Podrick. I believe we
329;00:24:20,441;00:24:24,477;know how to pour our own wine.
330;00:24:25,413;00:24:27,047;That's your new squire?
331;00:24:27,081;00:24:29,115;I could've found you
331;00:24:27,081;00:24:29,115;a proper lad.
332;00:24:29,150;00:24:31,885;Myself, I prefer
332;00:24:29,150;00:24:31,885;the improper ones.
333;00:24:31,920;00:24:34,922;Mm, that's a good red.
333;00:24:31,920;00:24:34,922;Dornish?
334;00:24:34,956;00:24:36,423;You know your wines,
334;00:24:34,956;00:24:36,423;My Lord.
335;00:24:36,457;00:24:37,958;That I do.
336;00:24:37,993;00:24:40,795;A fine dinner, My Lord.
337;00:24:40,829;00:24:42,764;Call me Tyrion, please.
338;00:24:42,798;00:24:44,633;I'm sure you're getting
338;00:24:42,798;00:24:44,633;used to fine dinners,
339;00:24:44,667;00:24:46,201;now that you're a lord.
340;00:24:46,236;00:24:48,103;Maybe I'll hire
340;00:24:46,236;00:24:48,103;this cook of yours.
341;00:24:48,138;00:24:50,139;Wars have been
341;00:24:48,138;00:24:50,139;started for less.
342;00:24:52,175;00:24:55,311;I heard there was some trouble in
342;00:24:52,175;00:24:55,311;Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
343;00:24:55,345;00:24:57,479;Mm, nasty business.
344;00:24:57,513;00:24:59,481;Had to be done.
344;00:24:57,513;00:24:59,481;Yes, of course.
345;00:24:59,515;00:25:01,749;The City Watch
345;00:24:59,515;00:25:01,749;must keep the peace,
346;00:25:01,783;00:25:05,652;only I hadn't realized
346;00:25:01,783;00:25:05,652;peace depended on killing babies.
347;00:25:05,687;00:25:09,222;Orders are orders.
347;00:25:05,687;00:25:09,222;Quite right.
348;00:25:09,256;00:25:11,324;Especially
348;00:25:09,256;00:25:11,324;the queen's orders.
349;00:25:11,358;00:25:13,126;I never said they were
349;00:25:11,358;00:25:13,126;the queen's orders.
350;00:25:13,160;00:25:17,664;No, but who else would want to
350;00:25:13,160;00:25:17,664;murder King Robert's bastards?
351;00:25:17,698;00:25:19,332;She's always been
351;00:25:17,698;00:25:19,332;a jealous woman.
352;00:25:19,366;00:25:21,367;You know your sister
352;00:25:19,366;00:25:21,367;better than I do.
353;00:25:21,402;00:25:23,436;You've heard the awful rumors
353;00:25:21,402;00:25:23,436;about my brother and sister?
354;00:25:23,471;00:25:25,105;I don't listen to filth.
355;00:25:25,139;00:25:28,408;That's good of you,
355;00:25:25,139;00:25:28,408;but you have heard them.
356;00:25:28,442;00:25:31,344;I suppose people who do believe
356;00:25:28,442;00:25:31,344;that filth consider Robert's bastards
357;00:25:31,378;00:25:34,046;to be better claimants to the throne
357;00:25:31,378;00:25:34,046;than Cersei's children.
358;00:25:34,081;00:25:36,149;Joffrey is my king.
358;00:25:34,081;00:25:36,149;The rest doesn't interest me.
359;00:25:36,183;00:25:38,351;I appreciate
359;00:25:36,183;00:25:38,351;your loyalty.
360;00:25:39,953;00:25:43,955;Tell me, when your men
360;00:25:39,953;00:25:43,955;slaughtered Ned Stark's men
361;00:25:43,990;00:25:47,825;in the throne room,
361;00:25:43,990;00:25:47,825;did you give the order?
362;00:25:47,860;00:25:49,827;I did.
363;00:25:49,861;00:25:51,562;And I would again.
364;00:25:51,596;00:25:53,397;The man was a traitor.
365;00:25:53,432;00:25:55,400;He tried to buy
365;00:25:53,432;00:25:55,400;my loyalty.
366;00:25:55,434;00:25:57,602;The fool.
367;00:25:57,637;00:25:59,771;He had no idea
367;00:25:57,637;00:25:59,771;you were already bought.
368;00:25:59,806;00:26:02,007;Are you drunk?
369;00:26:02,042;00:26:04,210;I'll not have my honor
369;00:26:02,042;00:26:04,210;questioned by an Imp!
370;00:26:04,245;00:26:08,348;I'm not questioning
370;00:26:04,245;00:26:08,348;Your Honor, Lord Janos.
371;00:26:08,382;00:26:10,051;I'm denying its existence.
372;00:26:10,085;00:26:13,187;If you think I'll stand here
372;00:26:10,085;00:26:13,187;and take this from you, dwarf--
373;00:26:13,254;00:26:15,956;Dwarf? Mm, you should
373;00:26:13,254;00:26:15,956;have stopped at Imp.
374;00:26:15,991;00:26:18,659;And, yes, you will stand here
374;00:26:15,991;00:26:18,659;and take it from me,
375;00:26:18,694;00:26:21,062;unless you'd like to take it
375;00:26:18,694;00:26:21,062;from my friend here.
376;00:26:22,264;00:26:24,098;I intend to serve
376;00:26:22,264;00:26:24,098;as Hand of the King
377;00:26:24,132;00:26:25,799;until my father
377;00:26:24,132;00:26:25,799;returns from the war.
378;00:26:25,867;00:26:27,934;And seeing as you betrayed
378;00:26:25,867;00:26:27,934;the last Hand of the King,
379;00:26:27,969;00:26:30,870;well, I just wouldn't
379;00:26:27,969;00:26:30,870;feel safe with you lurking about.
380;00:26:30,905;00:26:32,405;What are you t--
381;00:26:32,440;00:26:34,208;my friends at court
381;00:26:32,440;00:26:34,208;will not allow this!
382;00:26:34,242;00:26:36,343;The queen herself has granted--
382;00:26:34,242;00:26:36,343;The queen regent.
383;00:26:36,377;00:26:39,246;And you're a fool to believe
383;00:26:36,377;00:26:39,246;she is your friend.
384;00:26:39,281;00:26:41,616;We shall hear what Joffrey
384;00:26:39,281;00:26:41,616;has to say about this.
385;00:26:41,650;00:26:44,719;No, we shan't.
386;00:26:50,259;00:26:53,562;There's a ship leaving
386;00:26:50,259;00:26:53,562;for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea tonight.
387;00:26:53,596;00:26:57,231;From there I'm afraid it's rather
387;00:26:53,596;00:26:57,231;a long walk to Castle Black.
388;00:26:57,266;00:26:59,401;I hope you enjoy the Wall.
389;00:26:59,435;00:27:02,303;I found it
389;00:26:59,435;00:27:02,303;surprisingly beautiful...
390;00:27:02,338;00:27:06,274;In a brutal, horribly
390;00:27:02,338;00:27:06,274;uncomfortable sort of way.
391;00:27:06,308;00:27:07,842;The lads will escort you.
392;00:27:07,877;00:27:09,744;The streets aren't safe
392;00:27:07,877;00:27:09,744;at night, My Lord.
393;00:27:09,778;00:27:12,147;These men are
393;00:27:09,778;00:27:12,147;under my command!
394;00:27:12,181;00:27:14,349;I command you to arrest
394;00:27:12,181;00:27:14,349;this cutthroat.
395;00:27:14,383;00:27:16,218;His name is Bronn
396;00:27:16,252;00:27:18,553;and he is the new
396;00:27:16,252;00:27:18,553;commander of the City Watch.
397;00:27:18,587;00:27:20,221;Boys.
398;00:27:22,391;00:27:24,759;I have friends at court,
399;00:27:24,794;00:27:27,329;powerful friends!
400;00:27:27,363;00:27:29,931;The king himself
400;00:27:27,363;00:27:29,931;made me a lord!
401;00:27:34,871;00:27:37,139;To the new Commander.
402;00:27:43,180;00:27:47,216;If I told you to murder
402;00:27:43,180;00:27:47,216;an infant girl, say,
403;00:27:47,250;00:27:50,486;still at her
403;00:27:47,250;00:27:50,486;mother's breast,
404;00:27:50,521;00:27:53,455;would you do it
404;00:27:50,521;00:27:53,455;without question?
405;00:27:54,791;00:27:57,493;Without question? No.
406;00:27:57,527;00:27:59,828;I'd ask, how much?
407;00:28:17,148;00:28:19,582;If they come back,
407;00:28:17,148;00:28:19,582;I say we yield.
408;00:28:19,617;00:28:20,917;Gendry's the one
408;00:28:19,617;00:28:20,917;they want.
409;00:28:20,951;00:28:23,019;Don't want to get caught
409;00:28:20,951;00:28:23,019;in the middle of a battle.
410;00:28:23,053;00:28:24,653;I ain't afraid
410;00:28:23,053;00:28:24,653;of no battles.
411;00:28:24,687;00:28:27,322;If you got within a mile of a battle,
411;00:28:24,687;00:28:27,322;you'd fill your pants.
412;00:28:27,357;00:28:28,857;I've seen
412;00:28:27,357;00:28:28,857;lots of battles.
413;00:28:28,891;00:28:30,558;I saw--
413;00:28:28,891;00:28:30,558;Liar.
414;00:28:30,593;00:28:32,828;I saw a man
414;00:28:30,593;00:28:32,828;kill another man
415;00:28:32,862;00:28:35,230;just outside a tavern
415;00:28:32,862;00:28:35,230;in Flea Bottom.
416;00:28:35,265;00:28:37,666;Stabbed him
416;00:28:35,265;00:28:37,666;right in the neck.
417;00:28:37,701;00:28:40,502;Two men fighting
417;00:28:37,701;00:28:40,502;isn't a battle.
418;00:28:40,537;00:28:43,372;They had armor on.
418;00:28:40,537;00:28:43,372;So?
419;00:28:43,407;00:28:45,908;So, if they've got armor on,
419;00:28:43,407;00:28:45,908;it's a battle.
420;00:28:45,942;00:28:47,710;No, it isn't.
421;00:28:47,744;00:28:50,346;What does a dyer's apprentice
421;00:28:47,744;00:28:50,346;know about battles anyway?
422;00:28:50,380;00:28:52,648;Gendry's an armorer's
422;00:28:50,380;00:28:52,648;apprentice.
423;00:28:52,682;00:28:55,584;Hot pie, tell Gendry
423;00:28:52,682;00:28:55,584;what makes a fight into a battle.
424;00:28:57,420;00:28:59,922;It's, um, when
424;00:28:57,420;00:28:59,922;they've got armor on.
425;00:28:59,956;00:29:02,758;Who told you that?
426;00:29:02,792;00:29:04,226;A knight.
427;00:29:04,261;00:29:06,896;How'd you know
427;00:29:04,261;00:29:06,896;he was a knight?
428;00:29:08,198;00:29:11,567;Well, it was 'cause
428;00:29:08,198;00:29:11,567;he got armor on.
429;00:29:11,601;00:29:13,635;You don't have to be a knight
429;00:29:11,601;00:29:13,635;to have armor.
430;00:29:13,670;00:29:15,337;Any idiot
430;00:29:13,670;00:29:15,337;can buy armor.
431;00:29:15,372;00:29:17,106;How do you know?
432;00:29:17,140;00:29:19,241;'Cause I sold armor.
433;00:29:32,154;00:29:33,621;What do the Gold Cloaks
433;00:29:32,154;00:29:33,621;want with you?
434;00:29:33,655;00:29:36,491;No idea.
434;00:29:33,655;00:29:36,491;You're a liar.
435;00:29:36,525;00:29:38,826;You know, you shouldn't insult
435;00:29:36,525;00:29:38,826;people that are bigger than you.
436;00:29:38,861;00:29:41,496;Then I wouldn't get
436;00:29:38,861;00:29:41,496;to insult anyone.
437;00:29:41,530;00:29:43,898;I don't care
437;00:29:41,530;00:29:43,898;what any of them want.
438;00:29:43,932;00:29:45,667;No good's ever come
438;00:29:43,932;00:29:45,667;of their questions.
439;00:29:45,701;00:29:47,902;No good's ever come?
440;00:29:47,937;00:29:49,938;Who asked questions
440;00:29:47,937;00:29:49,938;before?
441;00:29:49,972;00:29:53,274;How can someone so small be such
441;00:29:49,972;00:29:53,274;a huge pain in my ass?
442;00:29:53,308;00:29:55,376;Who asked questions?
443;00:29:57,479;00:29:58,946;The Hand of the King.
444;00:29:58,980;00:30:01,182;Hands of the King.
445;00:30:01,216;00:30:04,385;Lord Arryn came first
445;00:30:01,216;00:30:04,385;a few weeks before he died,
446;00:30:04,419;00:30:08,956;and then Lord Stark came
446;00:30:04,419;00:30:08,956;a few weeks before he died.
447;00:30:08,990;00:30:10,925;Lord Stark?
448;00:30:10,959;00:30:15,229;See? Asking me
448;00:30:10,959;00:30:15,229;questions is bad luck.
449;00:30:16,264;00:30:19,165;You'll probably
449;00:30:16,264;00:30:19,165;be dead soon.
450;00:30:19,199;00:30:22,468;What did they ask about?
450;00:30:19,199;00:30:22,468;My mom.
451;00:30:22,502;00:30:25,171;Who's your mom?
451;00:30:22,502;00:30:25,171;Just my mom--
452;00:30:25,205;00:30:27,240;worked in a tavern,
452;00:30:25,205;00:30:27,240;died when I was little.
453;00:30:27,274;00:30:28,741;And who was your father?
454;00:30:28,776;00:30:32,144;Could've been one of those
454;00:30:28,776;00:30:32,144;gold-hatted bastards, for all I know.
455;00:30:32,178;00:30:34,279;What about you anyway?
456;00:30:34,313;00:30:37,415;You thought
456;00:30:34,313;00:30:37,415;they were after you.
457;00:30:37,450;00:30:39,250;Why?
458;00:30:39,285;00:30:41,819;Did you kill someone or is it
458;00:30:39,285;00:30:41,819;just because you're a girl?
459;00:30:42,988;00:30:45,122;I'm not a girl.
459;00:30:42,988;00:30:45,122;Yes, you are.
460;00:30:45,157;00:30:46,447;Do you think I'm as stupid
460;00:30:45,157;00:30:46,447;as the rest of them?
461;00:30:46,472;00:30:47,672;Stupider.
462;00:30:47,993;00:30:49,448;The Night's Watch doesn't take girls,
462;00:30:47,993;00:30:49,448;everyone knows that.
463;00:30:49,449;00:30:50,986;Yeah, that's true,
463;00:30:49,449;00:30:50,986;but you're still a girl.
464;00:30:51,011;00:30:52,211;I am not!
465;00:30:52,565;00:30:54,766;Yeah? Well, pull your cock out
465;00:30:52,565;00:30:54,766;and take a piss, then.
466;00:30:56,269;00:30:58,103;I don't need
466;00:30:56,269;00:30:58,103;to take a piss.
467;00:31:04,311;00:31:06,379;Lommy and hot pie
467;00:31:04,311;00:31:06,379;can't know.
468;00:31:06,414;00:31:07,847;No one can know.
469;00:31:07,882;00:31:11,785;Well, they won't,
469;00:31:07,882;00:31:11,785;not from me.
470;00:31:14,421;00:31:16,956;My name's not Arry.
471;00:31:16,990;00:31:19,758;It's Arya...
471;00:31:16,990;00:31:19,758;of House Stark.
472;00:31:21,827;00:31:25,029;Yoren is taking me home
472;00:31:21,827;00:31:25,029;to Winterfell.
473;00:31:25,063;00:31:28,332;He was your father--
473;00:31:25,063;00:31:28,332;the Hand, the traitor.
474;00:31:28,366;00:31:30,400;He was never a traitor.
475;00:31:30,434;00:31:32,468;Joffrey is a liar.
476;00:31:32,536;00:31:34,837;So you're a highborn, then.
476;00:31:32,536;00:31:34,837;You're a lady.
477;00:31:34,872;00:31:36,839;No. I mean, yes.
478;00:31:36,874;00:31:38,308;My mother was a lady
478;00:31:36,874;00:31:38,308;and my sister--
479;00:31:38,342;00:31:39,809;Yeah, but you were
479;00:31:38,342;00:31:39,809;a lord's daughter
480;00:31:39,843;00:31:41,911;and you lived
480;00:31:39,843;00:31:41,911;in a castle and you--
481;00:31:41,946;00:31:44,648;look, all that about cocks,
481;00:31:41,946;00:31:44,648;I should never have said--
482;00:31:44,682;00:31:46,950;and I've been pissing
482;00:31:44,682;00:31:46,950;in front of you and everything.
483;00:31:46,984;00:31:49,786;I-- I should be
483;00:31:46,984;00:31:49,786;calling you My Lady.
484;00:31:49,820;00:31:52,789;Do not call me My Lady.
484;00:31:49,820;00:31:52,789;As My Lady commands.
485;00:31:52,824;00:31:54,758;Well, that was unladylike.
486;00:31:54,792;00:31:57,061;Oh!
487;00:32:24,022;00:32:25,990;What's she carrying?
488;00:32:27,125;00:32:28,726;Myrish oranges,
489;00:32:28,760;00:32:31,796;wine from the Arbor...
490;00:32:31,830;00:32:35,266;And the heir to Pyke
490;00:32:31,830;00:32:35,266;and the Iron Islands.
491;00:32:37,702;00:32:40,704;The only living son
491;00:32:37,702;00:32:40,704;of Balon Greyjoy.
492;00:32:43,775;00:32:45,942;Me.
493;00:32:47,111;00:32:49,545;I don't like wine.
494;00:32:49,580;00:32:51,681;Woman's drink.
495;00:32:54,251;00:32:56,053;I need to get to Pyke.
496;00:33:05,998;00:33:07,965;I'll find you a horse.
497;00:33:18,478;00:33:21,847;I'm heading that way.
497;00:33:18,478;00:33:21,847;I can take you there.
498;00:33:21,882;00:33:24,550;I bet you can.
499;00:33:24,584;00:33:26,418;Have you been
499;00:33:24,584;00:33:26,418;at sea long?
500;00:33:26,453;00:33:28,988;Or were there just no women
500;00:33:26,453;00:33:28,988;where you came from?
501;00:33:29,022;00:33:31,424;None like you.
501;00:33:29,022;00:33:31,424;You don't know what I'm like.
502;00:33:31,458;00:33:34,126;Maybe you don't know
502;00:33:31,458;00:33:34,126;what you're like.
503;00:33:34,161;00:33:37,196;Maybe you need
503;00:33:34,161;00:33:37,196;someone to teach you.
504;00:33:37,231;00:33:39,365;Do you know who I am?
505;00:33:39,400;00:33:42,636;You think I offer free rides
505;00:33:39,400;00:33:42,636;to every man in jewelry,
506;00:33:42,670;00:33:45,939;Lord Greyjoy?
507;00:33:47,976;00:33:50,377;Have my things sent up
507;00:33:47,976;00:33:50,377;to the castle.
508;00:34:07,362;00:34:09,263;You should give me
508;00:34:07,362;00:34:09,263;the reins.
509;00:34:09,297;00:34:11,165;I'm a better rider
509;00:34:09,297;00:34:11,165;than you.
510;00:34:11,199;00:34:13,300;I've been on horseback
510;00:34:11,199;00:34:13,300;for the past nine years.
511;00:34:13,334;00:34:14,802;Nine years?
512;00:34:14,836;00:34:17,304;Do you still know
512;00:34:14,836;00:34:17,304;your way around a ship?
513;00:34:17,338;00:34:19,373;Have these hands
513;00:34:17,338;00:34:19,373;ever touched a rope?
514;00:34:19,407;00:34:21,875;Don't you worry
514;00:34:19,407;00:34:21,875;about my hands.
515;00:34:23,711;00:34:25,812;The sea is in my blood.
516;00:34:25,847;00:34:29,149;Your blood will be in the sea
516;00:34:25,847;00:34:29,149;if I don't watch where I'm going.
517;00:34:29,183;00:34:32,352;I have a proposal
517;00:34:29,183;00:34:32,352;for my father,
518;00:34:32,387;00:34:35,056;one that will
518;00:34:32,387;00:34:35,056;make him king again,
519;00:34:35,090;00:34:37,158;and me after him.
520;00:34:38,927;00:34:41,863;You may get to stay
520;00:34:38,927;00:34:41,863;in a castle tonight if you're lucky.
521;00:34:41,897;00:34:44,032;Is that an offer
521;00:34:41,897;00:34:44,032;from my future king?
522;00:34:44,067;00:34:46,635;An order from
522;00:34:44,067;00:34:46,635;your future king.
523;00:34:48,838;00:34:51,540;You can tell your grandchildren
523;00:34:48,838;00:34:51,540;about this night.
524;00:34:51,574;00:34:54,709;I don't imagine it will be
524;00:34:51,574;00:34:54,709;a story fit for children.
525;00:35:07,922;00:35:10,056;Father.
526;00:35:10,091;00:35:13,259;Nine years, is it?
527;00:35:13,294;00:35:15,295;They took
527;00:35:13,294;00:35:15,295;a frightened boy.
528;00:35:15,329;00:35:18,165;What have
528;00:35:15,329;00:35:18,165;they given back?
529;00:35:19,601;00:35:21,602;A man.
530;00:35:21,637;00:35:25,040;Your blood and your heir.
530;00:35:21,637;00:35:25,040;We shall see.
531;00:35:26,209;00:35:29,112;Stark had you
531;00:35:26,209;00:35:29,112;longer than I did.
532;00:35:29,146;00:35:31,314;Lord Stark is gone.
533;00:35:32,650;00:35:36,119;And how do you feel
533;00:35:32,650;00:35:36,119;about that?
534;00:35:38,890;00:35:41,458;What's done is done.
535;00:35:41,492;00:35:43,527;I've brought you
535;00:35:41,492;00:35:43,527;a proposal from Robb Stark.
536;00:35:43,561;00:35:46,696;Who gave you
536;00:35:43,561;00:35:46,696;those clothes?
537;00:35:46,730;00:35:50,200;Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
537;00:35:46,730;00:35:50,200;to make you his daughter?
538;00:35:50,234;00:35:53,169;If my clothes offend you,
538;00:35:50,234;00:35:53,169;I will change them.
539;00:35:53,204;00:35:54,871;You will.
540;00:35:55,940;00:35:58,442;That bauble
540;00:35:55,940;00:35:58,442;'round your neck--
541;00:35:58,476;00:36:01,612;did you pay the iron price
541;00:35:58,476;00:36:01,612;for it or the gold?
542;00:36:02,814;00:36:04,415;I asked a question.
543;00:36:04,449;00:36:07,085;Did you pull it from the neck
543;00:36:04,449;00:36:07,085;of a corpse you made
544;00:36:07,119;00:36:11,723;or did you buy it
544;00:36:07,119;00:36:11,723;to match your fine clothes?
545;00:36:13,526;00:36:16,827;Iron or gold?
546;00:36:19,064;00:36:21,198;Gold.
547;00:36:24,569;00:36:27,872;I'll not have my son
547;00:36:24,569;00:36:27,872;dressed as a whore.
548;00:36:30,875;00:36:33,343;My fears have come true--
549;00:36:33,378;00:36:35,612;the Starks
549;00:36:33,378;00:36:35,612;have made you theirs.
550;00:36:35,647;00:36:38,917;My blood is salt and iron.
550;00:36:35,647;00:36:38,917;Yet the Stark boy sends you to me
551;00:36:38,951;00:36:42,220;like a trained raven
551;00:36:38,951;00:36:42,220;clutching his message.
552;00:36:42,288;00:36:44,222;The offer he makes
552;00:36:42,288;00:36:44,222;is one I proposed.
553;00:36:44,257;00:36:46,825;He heeds your counsel?
553;00:36:44,257;00:36:46,825;I've lived with him,
554;00:36:46,860;00:36:48,427;hunted with him,
554;00:36:46,860;00:36:48,427;fought at his side.
555;00:36:48,495;00:36:50,096;He thinks of me
555;00:36:48,495;00:36:50,096;as a brother.
556;00:36:50,130;00:36:52,766;No, not here,
556;00:36:50,130;00:36:52,766;not in my hearing.
557;00:36:52,800;00:36:55,301;You will not
557;00:36:52,800;00:36:55,301;name him brother,
558;00:36:55,336;00:36:59,272;this son of the man who put
558;00:36:55,336;00:36:59,272;your true brothers to the sword.
559;00:36:59,307;00:37:02,142;Or have you forgotten
559;00:36:59,307;00:37:02,142;your own blood?
560;00:37:02,176;00:37:04,144;I forget nothing.
561;00:37:04,178;00:37:07,047;I remember my brothers.
562;00:37:07,082;00:37:10,017;And I remember
562;00:37:07,082;00:37:10,017;when my father was a king.
563;00:37:26,102;00:37:28,103;I see.
564;00:37:28,138;00:37:30,739;I destroy Robb Stark's
564;00:37:28,138;00:37:30,739;enemies for him
565;00:37:30,773;00:37:34,176;and he will make me
565;00:37:30,773;00:37:34,176;king of the Iron Islands once again.
566;00:37:34,210;00:37:38,012;I will lead the attack myself.
566;00:37:34,210;00:37:38,012;Oh, you will?
567;00:37:38,047;00:37:40,648;I'm your son,
567;00:37:38,047;00:37:40,648;your only living heir.
568;00:37:40,682;00:37:43,117;Who else?
569;00:37:45,153;00:37:47,254;I told you to wait outside.
570;00:37:48,590;00:37:50,691;How did you get
570;00:37:48,590;00:37:50,691;past the guards?
571;00:37:50,725;00:37:53,126;Anything with a cock
571;00:37:50,725;00:37:53,126;is easy to fool.
572;00:37:53,161;00:37:55,930;My dear.
573;00:37:59,067;00:38:00,701;Yara?
574;00:38:00,736;00:38:03,604;So good to see you,
574;00:38:00,736;00:38:03,604;brother.
575;00:38:03,638;00:38:07,274;This is a homecoming I'll tell
575;00:38:03,638;00:38:07,274;my grandchildren about.
576;00:38:09,778;00:38:11,212;She can't lead an attack!
577;00:38:11,246;00:38:14,482;And why not?
577;00:38:11,246;00:38:14,482;You're a woman!
578;00:38:14,516;00:38:17,952;You're the one in skirts.
578;00:38:14,516;00:38:17,952;This isn't Winterfell, boy.
579;00:38:17,987;00:38:20,488;Your sister took over command
579;00:38:17,987;00:38:20,488;of your eldest brother's ship
580;00:38:20,523;00:38:23,391;after your new father
580;00:38:20,523;00:38:23,391;killed him.
581;00:38:23,426;00:38:27,128;What's dead may never die.
582;00:38:27,163;00:38:29,164;The only nights she's spent
582;00:38:27,163;00:38:29,164;off these islands
583;00:38:29,198;00:38:31,199;have been spent
583;00:38:29,198;00:38:31,199;on the sea.
584;00:38:32,234;00:38:34,235;She's commanded men.
585;00:38:34,269;00:38:36,304;She's killed men.
586;00:38:36,338;00:38:38,473;She knows who she is.
587;00:38:41,110;00:38:43,578;No man gives me
587;00:38:41,110;00:38:43,578;a crown.
588;00:38:43,612;00:38:46,815;I pay the iron price.
589;00:38:46,849;00:38:48,783;I will take my crown,
590;00:38:48,818;00:38:52,087;for that is who I am.
591;00:38:52,121;00:38:54,556;That is who
591;00:38:52,121;00:38:54,556;we have always been.
592;00:38:59,196;00:39:01,264;You won't stand a chance against
592;00:38:59,196;00:39:01,264;the Lannisters on your own.
593;00:39:01,298;00:39:04,167;Who said anything
593;00:39:01,298;00:39:04,167;about the Lannisters?
594;00:39:11,777;00:39:13,245;You'll have your gold
595;00:39:13,279;00:39:14,913;when we take the treasury
595;00:39:13,279;00:39:14,913;at King's Landing.
596;00:39:14,947;00:39:16,715;All these kings
596;00:39:14,947;00:39:16,715;fighting for the throne,
597;00:39:16,749;00:39:19,685;and this Stannis
597;00:39:16,749;00:39:19,685;has the smallest army.
598;00:39:19,719;00:39:21,686;Why would I bet on the man
598;00:39:19,719;00:39:21,686;with the worst chance?
599;00:39:21,721;00:39:25,023;Because you're
599;00:39:21,721;00:39:25,023;a smart gambler.
600;00:39:25,058;00:39:28,026;Stannis has proved
600;00:39:25,058;00:39:28,026;himself in war twice.
601;00:39:28,060;00:39:31,329;His baby brother has never set foot
601;00:39:28,060;00:39:31,329;on a battlefield.
602;00:39:31,364;00:39:33,131;Neither has
602;00:39:31,364;00:39:33,131;the false King Joffrey.
603;00:39:33,166;00:39:35,133;And yet they both
603;00:39:33,166;00:39:35,133;have larger armies.
604;00:39:35,167;00:39:37,135;Stannis has just
604;00:39:35,167;00:39:37,135;begun the fight.
605;00:39:37,169;00:39:40,771;His Bannermen
605;00:39:37,169;00:39:40,771;will rally to his cause.
606;00:39:40,806;00:39:43,507;There's no man
606;00:39:40,806;00:39:43,507;in the Seven Kingdoms
607;00:39:43,541;00:39:45,109;more honorable
607;00:39:43,541;00:39:45,109;than Stannis Baratheon
608;00:39:45,143;00:39:46,543;or more worthy
608;00:39:45,143;00:39:46,543;of loyalty.
609;00:39:46,578;00:39:48,144;What is the world
609;00:39:46,578;00:39:48,144;coming to
610;00:39:48,179;00:39:50,780;when smugglers must vouch
610;00:39:48,179;00:39:50,780;for the honor of kings?
611;00:39:50,814;00:39:53,216;Mind your words, pirate.
611;00:39:50,814;00:39:53,216;Matthos.
612;00:39:53,250;00:39:54,784;You think I'm insulted?
613;00:39:54,819;00:39:57,820;I am a pirate.
613;00:39:54,819;00:39:57,820;I'm an excellent pirate.
614;00:39:57,855;00:40:00,490;I don't sail
614;00:39:57,855;00:40:00,490;for promises.
615;00:40:00,524;00:40:01,924;Of course you do.
616;00:40:01,959;00:40:04,627;Every time you leave harbor,
616;00:40:01,959;00:40:04,627;you're leaving on a promise--
617;00:40:04,661;00:40:06,128;a promise that
617;00:40:04,661;00:40:06,128;somewhere on the sea,
618;00:40:06,163;00:40:08,564;somebody's got some gold
618;00:40:06,163;00:40:08,564;and you can take it from him.
619;00:40:08,599;00:40:11,367;That's a promise that always comes true.
619;00:40:08,599;00:40:11,367;As is mine.
620;00:40:11,402;00:40:13,637;You're not a young man,
620;00:40:11,402;00:40:13,637;Salladhor.
621;00:40:13,671;00:40:15,472;And correct me
621;00:40:13,671;00:40:15,472;if I'm wrong--
622;00:40:15,506;00:40:17,207;most pirates
622;00:40:15,506;00:40:17,207;don't grow old.
623;00:40:17,242;00:40:19,343;Only the clever ones.
624;00:40:19,377;00:40:22,279;You want to spend
624;00:40:19,377;00:40:22,279;your last few years on the sea
625;00:40:22,313;00:40:24,414;stealing from
625;00:40:22,313;00:40:24,414;Pentoshi cheesemongers
626;00:40:24,449;00:40:25,783;and Meereenese
626;00:40:24,449;00:40:25,783;silk merchants?
627;00:40:25,817;00:40:27,884;Then go.
627;00:40:25,817;00:40:27,884;They're out there waiting for you.
628;00:40:27,919;00:40:29,620;That's easy.
629;00:40:29,654;00:40:32,189;What I'm offering you
629;00:40:29,654;00:40:32,189;is hard.
630;00:40:33,925;00:40:37,761;Come with me and plunder
630;00:40:33,925;00:40:37,761;the greatest city in Westeros.
631;00:40:37,795;00:40:40,497;You'll be the richest man
631;00:40:37,795;00:40:40,497;in Lys and the most famous.
632;00:40:40,531;00:40:44,401;They'll be singing songs about you
632;00:40:40,531;00:40:44,401;as long as men have voices to sing.
633;00:40:46,071;00:40:48,338;Salladhor Saan
633;00:40:46,071;00:40:48,338;is a good name for songs.
634;00:40:48,373;00:40:51,941;It is.
634;00:40:48,373;00:40:51,941;One thing-- I want the queen.
635;00:40:51,976;00:40:54,777;The queen?
635;00:40:51,976;00:40:54,777;Cersei-- I want her.
636;00:40:54,812;00:40:57,279;I'll sail with your fleet,
636;00:40:54,812;00:40:57,279;all 30 of my ships.
637;00:40:57,314;00:40:59,615;And if we don't drown at the bottom
637;00:40:57,314;00:40:59,615;of Blackwater Bay,
638;00:40:59,649;00:41:02,918;I will fuck this blonde queen
638;00:40:59,649;00:41:02,918;and I'll fuck her well.
639;00:41:02,953;00:41:04,787;This war
639;00:41:02,953;00:41:04,787;isn't about you.
640;00:41:04,821;00:41:08,123;We're not attacking King's Landing
640;00:41:04,821;00:41:08,123;so that you can rape the queen.
641;00:41:08,158;00:41:10,959;I'm not going to rape her.
641;00:41:08,158;00:41:10,959;I'm going to fuck her.
642;00:41:10,994;00:41:13,128;As if she would
642;00:41:10,994;00:41:13,128;just let you.
643;00:41:13,162;00:41:14,829;You don't know
643;00:41:13,162;00:41:14,829;how persuasive I am.
644;00:41:14,864;00:41:17,131;I've never tried
644;00:41:14,864;00:41:17,131;to fuck you.
645;00:41:18,834;00:41:22,470;Stannis is the rightful king
645;00:41:18,834;00:41:22,470;and the Lord of Light,
646;00:41:22,504;00:41:23,871;the one true God--
647;00:41:23,905;00:41:25,472;I've been all over
647;00:41:23,905;00:41:25,472;the world, my boy,
648;00:41:25,507;00:41:28,175;and everywhere I go,
648;00:41:25,507;00:41:28,175;people tell me about the true Gods.
649;00:41:28,209;00:41:30,377;They all think
649;00:41:28,209;00:41:30,377;they found the right one.
650;00:41:30,411;00:41:33,714;The one true God
650;00:41:30,411;00:41:33,714;is what's between a woman's legs,
651;00:41:33,748;00:41:36,317;and better yet,
651;00:41:33,748;00:41:36,317;a queen's legs.
652;00:41:37,820;00:41:39,921;I never thought you'd have
652;00:41:37,820;00:41:39,921;a true believer for a son.
653;00:41:39,956;00:41:41,656;Eh, he's young yet.
654;00:41:42,959;00:41:45,694;I promise you the gold.
654;00:41:42,959;00:41:45,694;I promise you the glory.
655;00:41:45,729;00:41:47,463;I cannot promise you
655;00:41:45,729;00:41:47,463;the queen.
656;00:41:50,801;00:41:52,668;You believe
656;00:41:50,801;00:41:52,668;your king can win?
657;00:41:52,702;00:41:54,903;He is the one true king.
658;00:41:54,937;00:41:56,738;You Westerosi
658;00:41:54,937;00:41:56,738;are funny people.
659;00:41:56,772;00:41:59,140;A man chops off your fingers
659;00:41:56,772;00:41:59,140;and you fall in love with him.
660;00:42:01,944;00:42:04,512;I'll sail with you,
660;00:42:01,944;00:42:04,512;Davos Seaworth.
661;00:42:04,546;00:42:08,149;You're the most honest
661;00:42:04,546;00:42:08,149;smuggler I ever met.
662;00:42:08,183;00:42:10,384;Make me rich.
663;00:42:10,418;00:42:13,821;Get me to the gates
663;00:42:10,418;00:42:13,821;of King's Landing and I will.
664;00:42:25,635;00:42:27,269;When will the king
664;00:42:25,635;00:42:27,269;have us sail?
665;00:42:27,303;00:42:29,638;As soon as his God
665;00:42:27,303;00:42:29,638;wills it.
666;00:42:29,706;00:42:32,308;He's my God, too,
666;00:42:29,706;00:42:32,308;and yours,
667;00:42:32,375;00:42:35,011;but you are
667;00:42:32,375;00:42:35,011;too blind to see.
668;00:42:37,114;00:42:39,148;Let me teach you how to read.
668;00:42:37,114;00:42:39,148;Oh, you and your mother.
669;00:42:39,182;00:42:40,849;It won't take long.
669;00:42:39,182;00:42:40,849;You already know the letters.
670;00:42:40,884;00:42:43,084;The holy books are much more
670;00:42:40,884;00:42:43,084;persuasive than I can be.
671;00:42:43,119;00:42:44,886;I wish I had
671;00:42:43,119;00:42:44,886;a God, truly.
672;00:42:44,921;00:42:47,589;I'm not mocking you, but I've seen
672;00:42:44,921;00:42:47,589;men pray to every God there is--
673;00:42:47,623;00:42:50,024;pray for wind, pray for rain,
673;00:42:47,623;00:42:50,024;pray for home.
674;00:42:50,059;00:42:52,827;None of it works.
674;00:42:50,059;00:42:52,827;But you always came home.
675;00:42:52,861;00:42:56,798;I wasn't praying.
675;00:42:52,861;00:42:56,798;No, but I was.
676;00:42:58,267;00:42:59,934;Every night
676;00:42:58,267;00:42:59,934;that you were at sea,
677;00:42:59,968;00:43:03,071;I lit a candle
677;00:42:59,968;00:43:03,071;and I prayed for you.
678;00:43:04,206;00:43:05,806;You want me
678;00:43:04,206;00:43:05,806;to have a God?
679;00:43:05,840;00:43:08,976;Fine. King Stannis
679;00:43:05,840;00:43:08,976;is my God.
680;00:43:09,010;00:43:11,478;He raised me up
680;00:43:09,010;00:43:11,478;and blessed me with his trust.
681;00:43:11,513;00:43:14,081;He gave you a future
681;00:43:11,513;00:43:14,081;I could never have imagined.
682;00:43:14,116;00:43:16,117;You know how to read.
682;00:43:14,116;00:43:16,117;You'll be a knight someday.
683;00:43:16,151;00:43:19,420;You think a fire God
683;00:43:16,151;00:43:19,420;commanded all that?
684;00:43:19,454;00:43:22,856;It was Stannis,
684;00:43:19,454;00:43:22,856;only Stannis.
685;00:43:22,891;00:43:25,759;Stannis is my king,
685;00:43:22,891;00:43:25,759;but he's only a man.
686;00:43:25,793;00:43:28,761;Don't tell him that.
687;00:43:30,598;00:43:32,732;Lord Janos Slynt was
687;00:43:30,598;00:43:32,732;commander of the City Watch.
688;00:43:32,766;00:43:34,167;You had no right
688;00:43:32,766;00:43:34,167;to exile him.
689;00:43:34,201;00:43:35,902;I have every right.
689;00:43:34,201;00:43:35,902;I am the King's Hand.
690;00:43:35,936;00:43:38,471;You're serving as the King's Hand
690;00:43:35,936;00:43:38,471;till father gets here.
691;00:43:38,506;00:43:40,073;I am Queen Regent.
692;00:43:40,108;00:43:41,775;Listen to me,
692;00:43:40,108;00:43:41,775;Queen Regent.
693;00:43:41,810;00:43:44,211;You're losing the people.
694;00:43:44,246;00:43:46,348;Do you hear me?
694;00:43:44,246;00:43:46,348;The people.
695;00:43:46,382;00:43:48,150;You think I care?
696;00:43:48,184;00:43:49,852;You might
696;00:43:48,184;00:43:49,852;find it difficult
697;00:43:49,886;00:43:52,755;to rule over millions
697;00:43:49,886;00:43:52,755;who want you dead.
698;00:43:52,789;00:43:54,656;Half the city will starve
698;00:43:52,789;00:43:54,656;when winter comes.
699;00:43:54,691;00:43:56,225;The other half will plot
699;00:43:54,691;00:43:56,225;to overthrow you.
700;00:43:56,259;00:43:59,261;And your gold-plated thugs
700;00:43:56,259;00:43:59,261;just gave them
701;00:43:59,296;00:44:01,097;their rallying cry--
702;00:44:01,131;00:44:03,733;The Queen
702;00:44:01,131;00:44:03,733;slaughters babies.
703;00:44:05,669;00:44:09,305;You don't even have
703;00:44:05,669;00:44:09,305;the decency to deny it.
704;00:44:18,882;00:44:22,385;It wasn't you who gave
704;00:44:18,882;00:44:22,385;the order, was it?
705;00:44:22,420;00:44:24,287;Joffrey didn't
705;00:44:22,420;00:44:24,287;even tell you.
706;00:44:27,025;00:44:28,659;Did he tell you?
707;00:44:28,694;00:44:30,028;I imagine that
707;00:44:28,694;00:44:30,028;would be even worse.
708;00:44:30,062;00:44:32,998;He did what needed
708;00:44:30,062;00:44:32,998;to be done.
709;00:44:33,032;00:44:36,068;You want to be Hand of the King?
709;00:44:33,032;00:44:36,068;You want to rule?
710;00:44:36,102;00:44:38,970;This is what ruling is--
710;00:44:36,102;00:44:38,970;lying on a bed of weeds,
711;00:44:39,005;00:44:41,439;ripping them out
711;00:44:39,005;00:44:41,439;by the root, one by one,
712;00:44:41,473;00:44:43,040;before they strangle you
712;00:44:41,473;00:44:43,040;in your sleep.
713;00:44:43,075;00:44:45,609;I'm no king, but I think there's more
713;00:44:43,075;00:44:45,609;to ruling than that.
714;00:44:45,643;00:44:47,644;I don't care
714;00:44:45,643;00:44:47,644;what you think!
715;00:44:47,679;00:44:49,246;You've never
715;00:44:47,679;00:44:49,246;taken it seriously.
716;00:44:49,280;00:44:51,614;You haven't,
716;00:44:49,280;00:44:51,614;Jaime hasn't.
717;00:44:55,119;00:44:57,153;It's all fallen on me.
718;00:45:01,159;00:45:04,995;As has Jaime repeatedly,
718;00:45:01,159;00:45:04,995;according to Stannis Baratheon.
719;00:45:09,901;00:45:12,336;You're funny.
720;00:45:14,639;00:45:18,209;You've always
720;00:45:14,639;00:45:18,209;been funny...
721;00:45:18,243;00:45:20,178;But none of your jokes
721;00:45:18,243;00:45:20,178;will ever match
722;00:45:20,212;00:45:22,413;the first one, will they?
723;00:45:23,616;00:45:26,317;You remember?
724;00:45:26,352;00:45:28,053;Back when you ripped
724;00:45:26,352;00:45:28,053;my mother open
725;00:45:28,087;00:45:30,788;on your way out of her
725;00:45:28,087;00:45:30,788;and she bled to death?
726;00:45:32,291;00:45:34,959;She was my mother, too.
727;00:45:34,993;00:45:37,061;Mother gone...
728;00:45:38,664;00:45:40,965;For the sake of you.
729;00:45:43,468;00:45:46,971;There's no bigger joke
729;00:45:43,468;00:45:46,971;in the world than that.
730;00:46:08,294;00:46:11,330;Your Grace.
730;00:46:08,294;00:46:11,330;Your Grace.
731;00:46:11,364;00:46:13,498;How did you fare
731;00:46:11,364;00:46:13,498;with your pirate?
732;00:46:13,533;00:46:16,969;Salladhor Saan will join
732;00:46:13,533;00:46:16,969;our fleet-- 30 ships.
733;00:46:17,003;00:46:19,004;His men know
733;00:46:17,003;00:46:19,004;how to fight.
734;00:46:19,039;00:46:22,441;In my experience, pirates
734;00:46:19,039;00:46:22,441;prefer fighting unarmed men.
735;00:46:22,476;00:46:24,110;It does seem
735;00:46:22,476;00:46:24,110;the wiser choice.
736;00:46:24,144;00:46:26,579;There won't be
736;00:46:24,144;00:46:26,579;a choice this time.
737;00:46:27,781;00:46:29,516;Do you trust him?
738;00:46:29,550;00:46:31,251;Salladhor Saan
738;00:46:29,550;00:46:31,251;is an old friend.
739;00:46:31,285;00:46:33,253;I've known him 30 years.
740;00:46:33,287;00:46:35,555;I've never trusted him,
741;00:46:35,590;00:46:39,693;but once he gets the smell of gold,
741;00:46:35,590;00:46:39,693;he never stops.
742;00:46:39,727;00:46:42,963;Well, if he does his job,
742;00:46:39,727;00:46:42,963;he'll have his share.
743;00:46:46,134;00:46:47,735;Leave us.
744;00:46:53,876;00:46:55,477;At once, Your Grace.
745;00:47:02,385;00:47:05,687;The Lord of Light shines
745;00:47:02,385;00:47:05,687;through you, young warrior.
746;00:47:11,360;00:47:12,994;Come.
747;00:47:19,834;00:47:21,335;What did you say to him?
748;00:47:21,369;00:47:24,805;I told him death by fire
748;00:47:21,369;00:47:24,805;is the purest death.
749;00:47:24,839;00:47:28,042;Why?
749;00:47:24,839;00:47:28,042;Because it is true.
750;00:47:29,010;00:47:30,844;You're troubled, my king.
751;00:47:30,879;00:47:33,046;Yeah.
752;00:47:33,081;00:47:35,716;These armies are toys
752;00:47:33,081;00:47:35,716;for the Lord of Light.
753;00:47:35,750;00:47:38,719;Tell your lord
753;00:47:35,750;00:47:38,719;to burn them, then.
754;00:47:38,753;00:47:40,187;I tell him nothing.
755;00:47:40,221;00:47:43,424;I pray for his commands
755;00:47:40,221;00:47:43,424;and I obey.
756;00:47:45,193;00:47:49,096;My little brother has 100,000
756;00:47:45,193;00:47:49,096;men according to the scouts,
757;00:47:49,131;00:47:52,333;men whose allegiance
757;00:47:49,131;00:47:52,333;rightly belongs to me.
758;00:47:52,367;00:47:54,268;You must have faith.
759;00:47:54,303;00:47:56,337;Faith?
760;00:47:56,372;00:47:59,907;In a real war, the side
760;00:47:56,372;00:47:59,907;with the greater number wins
761;00:47:59,942;00:48:01,876;nine times out of 10.
762;00:48:01,910;00:48:03,544;Then we must be
762;00:48:01,910;00:48:03,544;the 10th.
763;00:48:03,579;00:48:07,916;I cannot defeat
763;00:48:03,579;00:48:07,916;my brother in the field.
764;00:48:07,950;00:48:11,420;And I can't take King's Landing
764;00:48:07,950;00:48:11,420;without the men he's stolen.
765;00:48:12,923;00:48:16,592;I have seen the path
765;00:48:12,923;00:48:16,592;to victory in the flames.
766;00:48:18,094;00:48:21,463;But first, you must give yourself
766;00:48:18,094;00:48:21,463;to the Lord of Light.
767;00:48:21,497;00:48:24,833;I've said the words,
767;00:48:21,497;00:48:24,833;damn you.
768;00:48:27,937;00:48:30,205;I burnt the idols.
769;00:48:33,509;00:48:37,479;You must give
769;00:48:33,509;00:48:37,479;all of yourself.
770;00:48:41,984;00:48:43,985;I have a wife.
771;00:48:45,221;00:48:47,189;I took a vow.
772;00:48:48,357;00:48:52,727;She's sickly, weak...
773;00:48:54,263;00:48:57,365;Shut away in a tower.
774;00:48:57,400;00:48:59,501;She disgusts you.
775;00:49:02,505;00:49:05,540;And she's given
775;00:49:02,505;00:49:05,540;you nothing--
776;00:49:05,608;00:49:10,312;no sons,
776;00:49:05,608;00:49:10,312;only stillborns,
777;00:49:10,346;00:49:12,514;only death.
778;00:49:18,487;00:49:22,957;I will give you
778;00:49:18,487;00:49:22,957;a son, my king.
779;00:49:25,294;00:49:27,395;A son?
