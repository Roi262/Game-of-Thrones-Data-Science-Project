2;00:01:58,804;00:02:01,470;We shouldn't be out here alone.
2;00:01:58,804;00:02:01,470;Why not?
3;00:02:01,471;00:02:04,178;If your father--
3;00:02:01,471;00:02:04,178;He'll never know we're gone.
4;00:02:04,179;00:02:06,246;But if he finds out...
5;00:02:10,138;00:02:12,763;You don't need
5;00:02:10,138;00:02:12,763;to be afraid of my father.
6;00:02:39,888;00:02:42,303;Are you sure?
7;00:02:42,304;00:02:44,095;Yes.
8;00:02:44,096;00:02:47,304;We shouldn't go in.
8;00:02:44,096;00:02:47,304;Of course we should.
9;00:03:31,513;00:03:34,762;Get out.
9;00:03:31,513;00:03:34,762;Get out!
10;00:03:34,763;00:03:36,720;Let's go.
10;00:03:34,763;00:03:36,720;No.
11;00:03:36,721;00:03:38,496;Listen to your friend.
12;00:03:39,846;00:03:41,553;They said that you
12;00:03:39,846;00:03:41,553;were terrifying
13;00:03:41,554;00:03:45,637;with cat's teeth and three eyes.
14;00:03:45,638;00:03:47,513;You're not terrifying.
15;00:03:48,179;00:03:51,012;You're boring.
16;00:03:51,013;00:03:53,114;You don't know what I am.
17;00:03:53,234;00:03:56,632;I know you're a witch
17;00:03:53,234;00:03:56,632;and you can see the future.
18;00:03:58,013;00:03:59,928;Tell me mine.
19;00:03:59,929;00:04:02,220;Everyone wants
19;00:03:59,929;00:04:02,220;to know their future
20;00:04:02,221;00:04:04,345;until they know their future.
21;00:04:04,346;00:04:07,720;This is my father's land.
21;00:04:04,346;00:04:07,720;My land.
22;00:04:07,721;00:04:12,765;Tell me my future or I'll have your two
22;00:04:07,721;00:04:12,765;boring eyes gouged out of your head.
23;00:04:22,403;00:04:25,012;Your blood.
24;00:04:25,013;00:04:26,554;Give me a taste.
25;00:04:51,888;00:04:53,835;Three questions you get.
26;00:04:54,396;00:04:56,846;You won't like the answers.
27;00:05:00,513;00:05:03,220;I've been promised
27;00:05:00,513;00:05:03,220;to the prince.
28;00:05:03,221;00:05:06,345;When will we marry?
29;00:05:06,346;00:05:08,021;You will never wed the prince.
30;00:05:08,258;00:05:10,012;You will wed the king.
31;00:05:10,013;00:05:11,470;But I will be queen?
32;00:05:11,471;00:05:13,887;Oh, yes.
33;00:05:13,888;00:05:16,220;You'll be queen.
34;00:05:16,221;00:05:18,095;For a time.
35;00:05:18,096;00:05:21,178;Then comes another,
36;00:05:21,179;00:05:22,678;younger,
37;00:05:22,679;00:05:25,303;more beautiful,
38;00:05:25,304;00:05:28,595;to cast you down
38;00:05:25,304;00:05:28,595;and take all you hold dear.
39;00:05:28,596;00:05:31,803;W-will the king and I
39;00:05:28,596;00:05:31,803;have children?
40;00:05:31,804;00:05:37,199;No. The king will have 20
40;00:05:31,804;00:05:37,199;children and you will have three.
41;00:05:37,319;00:05:38,303;That doesn't make sense.
42;00:05:38,304;00:05:41,762;Gold will be their crowns.
43;00:05:41,763;00:05:44,638;Gold their shrouds.
44;00:05:51,929;00:05:53,470;Come on, we have to go.
45;00:05:54,263;00:05:56,928;We have to go!
45;00:05:54,263;00:05:56,928;Cersei!
46;00:06:00,888;00:06:02,887;Bearers, put it down.
47;00:06:18,221;00:06:21,595;Bearers, up.
48;00:06:21,596;00:06:23,346;Away.
49;00:06:37,013;00:06:39,762;Your Grace, we are
49;00:06:37,013;00:06:39,762;honored by your presence.
50;00:06:39,763;00:06:41,178;The mourners are waiting.
51;00:06:41,298;00:06:43,693;They will keep waiting.
52;00:06:43,797;00:06:45,546;I want a moment alone with him.
53;00:06:45,547;00:06:48,005;But, Your Grace, many of these lords
53;00:06:45,547;00:06:48,005;and ladies have travelled
54;00:06:48,006;00:06:50,171;day and night to be here from
54;00:06:48,006;00:06:50,171;all seven kingdoms.
55;00:06:50,172;00:06:51,922;They will wait.
56;00:07:19,172;00:07:21,296;He never wanted you
56;00:07:19,172;00:07:21,296;to be a Kingsguard,
57;00:07:21,297;00:07:25,047;but here you are,
57;00:07:21,297;00:07:25,047;protecting his dead body.
58;00:07:26,881;00:07:30,797;What he built, it's ours.
59;00:07:32,006;00:07:34,922;He built it for us.
59;00:07:32,006;00:07:34,922;He meant it for us.
60;00:07:37,172;00:07:38,671;They're going to try
60;00:07:37,172;00:07:38,671;to take it away.
61;00:07:38,672;00:07:40,046;All of it.
61;00:07:38,672;00:07:40,046;They?
62;00:07:40,047;00:07:41,755;All of them out there,
62;00:07:40,047;00:07:41,755;our enemies.
63;00:07:41,756;00:07:44,546;They're waiting in line to make sure
63;00:07:41,756;00:07:44,546;he's really dead.
64;00:07:44,547;00:07:47,338;And as soon as they see
64;00:07:44,547;00:07:47,338;the stones on his eyes,
65;00:07:47,339;00:07:49,171;they'll set to work
65;00:07:47,339;00:07:49,171;on tearing us apart.
66;00:07:49,172;00:07:51,921;They have nothing to do with it.
67;00:07:51,922;00:07:54,213;The man who murdered our father,
67;00:07:51,922;00:07:54,213;he tore us apart.
68;00:07:54,214;00:07:56,546;He's the enemy.
68;00:07:54,214;00:07:56,546;I've been telling you for years.
69;00:07:56,547;00:07:57,588;You've been defending
69;00:07:56,547;00:07:57,588;him for years.
70;00:07:57,589;00:07:59,755;This is exactly what they want.
71;00:07:59,756;00:08:01,380;And now our father is dead
72;00:08:01,381;00:08:04,839;and that little monster
72;00:08:01,381;00:08:04,839;is out there somewhere drawing breath.
73;00:08:06,964;00:08:09,131;Did you set him free?
74;00:08:11,756;00:08:13,463;Tyrion may be a monster,
75;00:08:13,464;00:08:17,463;but at least he killed
75;00:08:13,464;00:08:17,463;our father on purpose.
76;00:08:17,464;00:08:19,588;You killed him by mistake.
77;00:08:19,589;00:08:21,381;With stupidity.
78;00:08:22,881;00:08:24,296;You're a man
78;00:08:22,881;00:08:24,296;of action, aren't you?
79;00:08:24,297;00:08:26,838;When it occurs to you
79;00:08:24,297;00:08:26,838;to do something, you do it.
80;00:08:26,839;00:08:29,839;Never mind the consequences.
81;00:08:31,797;00:08:34,505;Take a look.
82;00:08:34,506;00:08:35,506;Look at the consequences.
83;00:08:38,506;00:08:40,339;Here they are.
84;00:08:44,214;00:08:47,506;He loved you more than
84;00:08:44,214;00:08:47,506;anyone in this world.
85;00:10:19,756;00:10:21,589;Apologies.
86;00:10:31,589;00:10:34,963;I still don't see
86;00:10:31,589;00:10:34,963;why I had to stay
87;00:10:34,964;00:10:37,046;in this fucking crate
87;00:10:34,964;00:10:37,046;once we set sail.
88;00:10:37,047;00:10:39,963;I saved your life.
89;00:10:39,964;00:10:42,713;If they catch you,
89;00:10:39,964;00:10:42,713;they catch me.
90;00:10:42,714;00:10:44,755;I cannot say
90;00:10:42,714;00:10:44,755;I feel overly guilty
91;00:10:44,756;00:10:46,838;about leaving you
91;00:10:44,756;00:10:46,838;in that fucking crate.
92;00:10:46,839;00:10:49,546;Do you know what it's like
92;00:10:46,839;00:10:49,546;to stuff your shit
93;00:10:49,547;00:10:51,213;through one of those airholes?
94;00:10:51,214;00:10:52,505;No, I only know what it's like
95;00:10:52,506;00:10:55,672;to pick up your shit
95;00:10:52,506;00:10:55,672;and throw it overboard.
96;00:10:59,006;00:11:01,296;Pentos?
97;00:11:01,297;00:11:03,755;The home of my colleague
97;00:11:01,297;00:11:03,755;Illyrio Mopatis,
98;00:11:03,756;00:11:06,130;a merchant.
99;00:11:06,131;00:11:08,088;He and I met many years ago
100;00:11:08,089;00:11:09,505;through mutual friends.
101;00:11:09,506;00:11:12,880;A group of people
101;00:11:09,506;00:11:12,880;who saw Robert Baratheon
102;00:11:12,881;00:11:14,338;for the disaster he was.
103;00:11:14,339;00:11:17,380;We tried to do what
103;00:11:14,339;00:11:17,380;was best for the realm
104;00:11:17,381;00:11:20,921;by supporting
104;00:11:17,381;00:11:20,921;a Targaryen restoration.
105;00:11:20,922;00:11:23,546;And thus began
105;00:11:20,922;00:11:23,546;the chain of mistakes
106;00:11:23,547;00:11:26,171;that has led us both here.
107;00:11:26,172;00:11:29,630;Things have gotten worse,
107;00:11:26,172;00:11:29,630;not better.
108;00:11:29,631;00:11:32,714;Westeros needs to be
108;00:11:29,631;00:11:32,714;saved from itself.
109;00:11:36,464;00:11:38,338;Mmm.
110;00:11:38,339;00:11:39,796;Much better.
111;00:11:39,797;00:11:41,464;My lord?
112;00:11:43,506;00:11:46,338;I don't think I am anymore.
113;00:11:46,339;00:11:48,547;A lord.
114;00:11:56,381;00:11:58,339;Are you a lord
114;00:11:56,381;00:11:58,339;if you kill your father?
115;00:12:00,714;00:12:04,380;I don't imagine
115;00:12:00,714;00:12:04,380;they revoke your nobility
116;00:12:04,381;00:12:06,338;for killing a whore.
117;00:12:06,339;00:12:08,255;It must happen all the time.
118;00:12:08,256;00:12:10,671;You already drank yourself
118;00:12:08,256;00:12:10,671;across the Narrow Sea.
119;00:12:10,672;00:12:12,255;In a box.
119;00:12:10,672;00:12:12,255;Why stop now?
120;00:12:12,256;00:12:15,672;Because we are talking
120;00:12:12,256;00:12:15,672;about the future of our country.
121;00:12:19,547;00:12:22,256;The future is shit.
122;00:12:24,464;00:12:26,339;Just like the past.
123;00:14:18,386;00:14:19,718;_
124;00:14:19,838;00:14:22,192;_

128;00:14:46,506;00:14:47,713;Shh.
129;00:14:47,714;00:14:49,422;Shh.
130;00:15:33,922;00:15:35,713;The Sons of the Harpy?
131;00:15:35,714;00:15:38,046;Yes, Your Grace.
131;00:15:35,714;00:15:38,046;They left it on the body.
132;00:15:38,047;00:15:39,380;They've never killed before.
133;00:15:39,381;00:15:41,880;It was only a matter
133;00:15:39,381;00:15:41,880;of time, Your Grace.
134;00:15:41,881;00:15:44,380;Conquerors always meet
134;00:15:41,881;00:15:44,380;with resistance.
135;00:15:44,381;00:15:46,463;I didn't conquer them.
135;00:15:44,381;00:15:46,463;Their own people did.
136;00:15:46,874;00:15:50,341;_

138;00:15:54,797;00:15:57,546;He did not risk his life
138;00:15:54,797;00:15:57,546;fighting for his freedom
139;00:15:57,547;00:15:59,546;so cowards in masks
139;00:15:57,547;00:15:59,546;could take it away.
140;00:15:59,547;00:16:01,046;And I did not take up
140;00:15:59,547;00:16:01,046;residence in this pyramid
141;00:16:01,047;00:16:04,505;so I could watch the city below
141;00:16:01,047;00:16:04,505;decline into chaos.
142;00:16:04,506;00:16:07,046;What was the name
142;00:16:04,506;00:16:07,046;of the man you lost?
143;00:16:07,047;00:16:10,505;White Rat, Your Grace.
144;00:16:10,506;00:16:14,671;I want him buried
144;00:16:10,506;00:16:14,671;with honor, publically
145;00:16:14,672;00:16:17,088;in the Temple of the Graces.
146;00:16:17,089;00:16:19,130;The Sons of the Harpy
146;00:16:17,089;00:16:19,130;will hear that message.
147;00:16:19,131;00:16:20,838;Make them very angry.
148;00:16:20,839;00:16:22,796;Angry snakes lash out.
149;00:16:22,797;00:16:25,505;Makes chopping off their heads
149;00:16:22,797;00:16:25,505;that much easier.
150;00:16:25,506;00:16:28,922;Find the men who did this
150;00:16:25,506;00:16:28,922;and bring them to me.
151;00:16:32,297;00:16:33,297;Your Grace.
152;00:16:47,797;00:16:49,796;Torgo Nudho.
153;00:16:49,797;00:16:51,672;Missandei hin Naath.
154;00:16:53,964;00:16:55,256;I wanted to speak with you.
155;00:17:04,089;00:17:06,421;Why do you come?
156;00:17:06,422;00:17:09,381;White Rat, the Unsullied who...
157;00:17:11,672;00:17:14,881;I have heard they found
157;00:17:11,672;00:17:14,881;his body in a brothel.
158;00:17:16,131;00:17:19,046;I have heard that
158;00:17:16,131;00:17:19,046;more than one Unsullied
159;00:17:19,047;00:17:21,714;has been known to visit
159;00:17:19,047;00:17:21,714;Meereen's brothels.
160;00:17:24,714;00:17:26,214;May I ask you why?
161;00:17:27,964;00:17:30,297;Why would an Unsullied
161;00:17:27,964;00:17:30,297;go to a brothel?
162;00:17:33,881;00:17:36,797;I do not know.
163;00:17:37,714;00:17:40,339;I must go.
164;00:17:55,422;00:17:57,546;Get your shield up.
164;00:17:55,422;00:17:57,546;It's too heavy.
165;00:17:57,547;00:17:59,838;If it wasn't heavy,
165;00:17:57,547;00:17:59,838;it wouldn't stop a sword.
166;00:17:59,839;00:18:01,381;Now get it up.
167;00:18:13,047;00:18:16,546;Come.
167;00:18:13,047;00:18:16,546;Try it again.
168;00:18:16,547;00:18:19,671;Drive at me.
168;00:18:16,547;00:18:19,671;Keep your shield up.
169;00:18:19,672;00:18:22,130;Or I'll ring
169;00:18:19,672;00:18:22,130;your head like a bell.
170;00:18:22,131;00:18:24,921;Shouldn't you be training, too?
171;00:18:24,922;00:18:27,422;Well, I'm hardly a new recruit.
172;00:18:30,714;00:18:33,255;How many brothers can say that they've
172;00:18:30,714;00:18:33,255;killed a white walker and a Thenn?
173;00:18:33,256;00:18:36,380;I might be the first in history.
174;00:18:36,381;00:18:38,296;- Shield up.
174;00:18:36,381;00:18:38,296;- These men need a firm hand.
175;00:18:38,297;00:18:40,046;Always have.
176;00:18:40,047;00:18:42,214;They're poachers and thieves.
177;00:18:44,881;00:18:46,797;Not soldiers.
178;00:18:52,631;00:18:54,381;That one hates me.
179;00:18:56,506;00:18:58,713;If Ser Alliser
179;00:18:56,506;00:18:58,713;is chosen as the new Lord Commander...
180;00:18:58,714;00:19:02,380;He hates the wildlings.
181;00:19:02,381;00:19:04,171;All the wildlings.
182;00:19:04,172;00:19:06,755;Don't let them send us away.
182;00:19:04,172;00:19:06,755;It's not a sure thing.
183;00:19:06,756;00:19:09,296;Ser Denys Mallister has
183;00:19:06,756;00:19:09,296;commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years
184;00:19:09,297;00:19:11,130;and people say he's a good man.
185;00:19:11,131;00:19:12,255;He's running against
185;00:19:11,131;00:19:12,255;Ser Alliser--
186;00:19:12,256;00:19:14,880;Sam, don't let them
186;00:19:12,256;00:19:14,880;send us away.
187;00:19:14,881;00:19:16,130;I told you.
188;00:19:16,131;00:19:19,255;Wherever you go, I go, too.
189;00:19:19,256;00:19:21,547;You can't leave.
189;00:19:19,256;00:19:21,547;They'll execute you.
190;00:19:29,547;00:19:31,507;Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot.
190;00:19:29,547;00:19:31,507;Yah!
191;00:19:33,172;00:19:34,256;Shield up.
192;00:19:36,839;00:19:38,714;The king wants a word.
193;00:20:06,172;00:20:08,338;You're not cold, my lady?
194;00:20:08,339;00:20:10,505;Never.
195;00:20:10,506;00:20:14,506;The Lord's fire lives
195;00:20:10,506;00:20:14,506;within me, Jon Snow.
196;00:20:17,256;00:20:19,047;Feel.
197;00:20:26,297;00:20:28,131;Are you a virgin?
198;00:20:31,589;00:20:33,672;No.
199;00:20:35,256;00:20:37,131;Good.
200;00:20:43,839;00:20:46,296;Your Grace.
201;00:20:46,297;00:20:48,506;The bastard of Winterfell.
202;00:20:56,297;00:20:59,339;You know who rules
202;00:20:56,297;00:20:59,339;at Winterfell now?
203;00:21:00,506;00:21:02,296;Roose Bolton.
204;00:21:02,297;00:21:05,589;Mmm, the traitor who plunged a dagger
204;00:21:02,297;00:21:05,589;in Robb Stark's heart.
205;00:21:06,547;00:21:09,131;Don't you want to avenge him?
206;00:21:10,464;00:21:13,463;I want a great
206;00:21:10,464;00:21:13,463;many things, Your Grace.
207;00:21:13,464;00:21:15,963;But I'm a sworn brother
207;00:21:13,464;00:21:15,963;of the Night's Watch now.
208;00:21:15,964;00:21:19,296;I've been talking
208;00:21:15,964;00:21:19,296;to your sworn brothers.
209;00:21:19,297;00:21:21,005;Many of them love you.
209;00:21:19,297;00:21:21,005;They're good men.
210;00:21:21,006;00:21:22,713;Many don't.
211;00:21:22,714;00:21:26,713;You were seen taking the body
211;00:21:22,714;00:21:26,713;of a wildling girl north of the Wall.
212;00:21:26,714;00:21:28,380;Why?
213;00:21:28,381;00:21:29,588;It's where she belonged.
214;00:21:29,589;00:21:32,005;Some of the Night's
214;00:21:29,589;00:21:32,005;Watch feel you have
215;00:21:32,006;00:21:33,963;too much affection
215;00:21:32,006;00:21:33,963;for the wildlings.
216;00:21:33,964;00:21:36,380;They were born on the
216;00:21:33,964;00:21:36,380;wrong side of the Wall.
217;00:21:36,381;00:21:38,421;That doesn't make them monsters.
218;00:21:38,422;00:21:39,713;No matter.
219;00:21:39,714;00:21:40,713;I shall take back the North
220;00:21:40,714;00:21:42,630;from the thieves who stole it.
221;00:21:42,631;00:21:45,213;Tywin Lannister is dead.
221;00:21:42,631;00:21:45,213;He can't protect them now.
222;00:21:45,214;00:21:48,796;I shall mount Roose Bolton's
222;00:21:45,214;00:21:48,796;head on a spike.
223;00:21:48,797;00:21:51,505;But if I'm to take Winterfell,
223;00:21:48,797;00:21:51,505;I need more men.
224;00:21:51,506;00:21:53,505;The men of the Night's Watch
224;00:21:51,506;00:21:53,505;are sworn to play no part--
225;00:21:53,506;00:21:56,505;I'm not talking about
225;00:21:53,506;00:21:56,505;the damn Night's Watch.
226;00:21:56,506;00:21:58,256;I'm talking about the wildlings.
227;00:22:06,256;00:22:10,380;Your Grace,
227;00:22:06,256;00:22:10,380;you want the wildlings
228;00:22:10,381;00:22:12,380;to march in your army?
229;00:22:12,381;00:22:13,671;If they swear to follow me,
229;00:22:12,381;00:22:13,671;I'll pardon them.
230;00:22:13,672;00:22:16,255;We'll take Winterfell.
230;00:22:13,672;00:22:16,255;Once the North is won,
231;00:22:16,256;00:22:17,171;I'll declare them
231;00:22:16,256;00:22:17,171;citizens of the realm.
232;00:22:17,172;00:22:19,380;I'll give them land to live on.
233;00:22:19,381;00:22:23,546;It's a fair offer.
233;00:22:19,381;00:22:23,546;More than fair.
234;00:22:23,547;00:22:25,505;I'll offer them their lives
234;00:22:23,547;00:22:25,505;and their freedom
235;00:22:25,506;00:22:28,546;if Mance kneels before me
235;00:22:25,506;00:22:28,546;and swears his loyalty.
236;00:22:28,547;00:22:29,668;I don't think that's likely.
237;00:22:32,506;00:22:33,921;You admire him, don't you?
238;00:22:33,922;00:22:36,671;I respect him.
238;00:22:33,922;00:22:36,671;He likes you.
239;00:22:36,672;00:22:38,588;Convince him to bend the knee...
239;00:22:36,672;00:22:38,588;Your Grace.
240;00:22:38,589;00:22:39,922;...or he burns.
241;00:22:43,839;00:22:45,296;How much time do I have?
242;00:22:45,297;00:22:46,963;Nightfall.
243;00:22:46,964;00:22:49,255;The sun drops fast
243;00:22:46,964;00:22:49,255;this time of year.
244;00:22:49,256;00:22:50,921;Hurry, Jon Snow.
245;00:22:54,547;00:22:56,130;Shield up.
246;00:22:56,131;00:22:58,963;Attack, my lord!
247;00:22:58,964;00:23:00,338;Attack!
248;00:23:00,339;00:23:03,963;Don't cross your feet.
249;00:23:03,964;00:23:05,713;My sons had swords
249;00:23:03,964;00:23:05,713;in their hands
250;00:23:05,714;00:23:07,338;from the time they could walk.
250;00:23:05,714;00:23:07,338;This one...
251;00:23:07,339;00:23:09,505;Lord Arryn will never
251;00:23:07,339;00:23:09,505;be a great warrior.
252;00:23:09,506;00:23:11,505;Great warrior?
253;00:23:11,506;00:23:14,130;He swings a sword
253;00:23:11,506;00:23:14,130;like a girl with palsy.
254;00:23:14,131;00:23:17,046;My lord.
255;00:23:17,047;00:23:18,921;Sword up, my lord!
256;00:23:26,422;00:23:28,296;Some boys develop more slowly.
257;00:23:28,297;00:23:30,588;He's still young.
258;00:23:30,589;00:23:33,713;He's 13.
258;00:23:30,589;00:23:33,713;Boys go to war at 13.
259;00:23:33,714;00:23:35,755;He has other gifts.
259;00:23:33,714;00:23:35,755;Does he?
260;00:23:35,756;00:23:38,546;The gift of a great name.
261;00:23:38,547;00:23:42,296;Sometimes that's all one needs.
262;00:23:47,256;00:23:50,005;Good-bye, Lord Royce, and thank you
262;00:23:47,256;00:23:50,005;for all you've done for me.
263;00:23:50,006;00:23:52,421;I have done nothing more
263;00:23:50,006;00:23:52,421;than my duty, my lady.
264;00:23:52,422;00:23:53,755;I have no doubt
264;00:23:52,422;00:23:53,755;that on my return,
265;00:23:53,756;00:23:56,713;Robin's skills will have
265;00:23:53,756;00:23:56,713;improved immeasurably.
266;00:23:56,714;00:23:57,880;He'll be safe here.
267;00:23:57,881;00:24:01,838;As for his skills,
268;00:24:01,839;00:24:04,047;I make no promises.
269;00:24:17,006;00:24:20,213;Will we head north
269;00:24:17,006;00:24:20,213;at some point?
270;00:24:20,214;00:24:23,505;He said Sansa had a brother
270;00:24:20,214;00:24:23,505;at Castle Black.
271;00:24:23,506;00:24:25,130;We're a few days' ride
271;00:24:23,506;00:24:25,130;from the Kingsroad.
272;00:24:25,131;00:24:28,214;But that will take us--
272;00:24:25,131;00:24:28,214;Us?
273;00:24:30,464;00:24:32,755;The only reason you're here
273;00:24:30,464;00:24:32,755;is because Jaime Lannister
274;00:24:32,756;00:24:34,422;told me you weren't
274;00:24:32,756;00:24:34,422;safe in the capital.
275;00:24:36,547;00:24:39,505;You're hundreds of miles
275;00:24:36,547;00:24:39,505;from King's Landing.
276;00:24:39,506;00:24:41,505;No one knows what you look like.
277;00:24:41,506;00:24:43,921;No one cares.
277;00:24:41,506;00:24:43,921;You're safe.
278;00:24:43,922;00:24:47,422;But I'm your squire.
278;00:24:43,922;00:24:47,422;Do you even know what a squire is?
279;00:24:49,214;00:24:50,005;An attendant to a knight.
280;00:24:50,006;00:24:52,630;I'm not a knight.
281;00:24:52,631;00:24:54,880;That means you're not a squire.
282;00:24:54,881;00:24:55,963;Well, where would I go?
283;00:24:55,964;00:24:58,839;I don't care.
283;00:24:55,964;00:24:58,839;I'm not your mother.
284;00:25:07,506;00:25:09,630;You swore to find
284;00:25:07,506;00:25:09,630;the Stark girls.
285;00:25:09,631;00:25:12,421;I found Arya. She didn't want
285;00:25:09,631;00:25:12,421;my protection.
286;00:25:12,422;00:25:14,631;Sansa still might.
286;00:25:12,422;00:25:14,631;Will you shut your mouth?
287;00:25:15,797;00:25:17,631;I didn't ask for your advice.
288;00:25:19,464;00:25:22,296;I don't want anyone
288;00:25:19,464;00:25:22,296;following me.
289;00:25:22,297;00:25:24,213;I'm not a leader.
290;00:25:24,214;00:25:27,213;All I ever wanted
290;00:25:24,214;00:25:27,213;was to fight for a lord I believed in.
291;00:25:27,214;00:25:30,131;The good lords are dead
291;00:25:27,214;00:25:30,131;and the rest are monsters.
292;00:25:41,131;00:25:43,380;You told Lord Royce
292;00:25:41,131;00:25:43,380;we were going to the Fingers.
293;00:25:43,381;00:25:45,588;I did.
294;00:25:45,589;00:25:48,713;But we're heading west.
294;00:25:45,589;00:25:48,713;We are.
295;00:25:48,714;00:25:50,672;If he wanted to betray us,
295;00:25:48,714;00:25:50,672;he already would have.
296;00:25:52,214;00:25:55,963;Lord Royce might be as honorable
296;00:25:52,214;00:25:55,963;as he thinks he is,
297;00:25:55,964;00:25:58,338;but he's not alone
297;00:25:55,964;00:25:58,338;in that castle.
298;00:25:58,339;00:25:59,421;Do you trust all those
298;00:25:58,339;00:25:59,421;knights and ladies,
299;00:25:59,422;00:26:02,630;stable boys and serving girls?
300;00:26:02,631;00:26:05,588;No, do you trust the carriage driver
300;00:26:02,631;00:26:05,588;or the knights escorting us?
301;00:26:05,589;00:26:07,046;No.
302;00:26:07,047;00:26:09,671;But I pay them well
303;00:26:09,672;00:26:11,963;and they've seen what happens
303;00:26:09,672;00:26:11,963;to men who disappoint me.
304;00:26:11,964;00:26:14,338;So where are we going?
305;00:26:14,339;00:26:16,755;To a land where
305;00:26:14,339;00:26:16,755;you trust everyone?
306;00:26:16,756;00:26:19,505;To a land so far from here,
307;00:26:19,506;00:26:21,426;even Cersei Lannister
307;00:26:19,506;00:26:21,426;can't get her hands on you.
308;00:26:30,297;00:26:33,381;It was such a deep,
308;00:26:30,297;00:26:33,381;deep shock to us all.
309;00:26:36,922;00:26:38,088;Your father was a--
310;00:26:38,089;00:26:41,046;a force to be reckoned with.
311;00:26:41,047;00:26:42,255;He truly was.
312;00:26:42,256;00:26:45,421;I wouldn't presume to claim
313;00:26:45,422;00:26:47,755;to have known him
313;00:26:45,422;00:26:47,755;as such, but--
314;00:26:47,756;00:26:51,296;but just being in his presence was enough
314;00:26:47,756;00:26:51,296;to make it so clear
315;00:26:51,297;00:26:53,463;just how formidable
315;00:26:51,297;00:26:53,463;a person you were dealing with.
316;00:26:53,464;00:26:56,838;What a-- what a force
316;00:26:53,464;00:26:56,838;to be reckoned with.
317;00:26:59,381;00:27:01,756;Thank you so much
317;00:26:59,381;00:27:01,756;for your kind words.
318;00:27:06,422;00:27:08,963;Deepest condolences, Your Grace.
319;00:27:08,964;00:27:11,005;This tragedy...
319;00:27:08,964;00:27:11,005;I never trusted Varys.
320;00:27:11,006;00:27:14,047;I often warned...
321;00:27:16,756;00:27:18,881;Your Grace.
322;00:27:21,631;00:27:24,130;Cousin Lancel.
322;00:27:21,631;00:27:24,130;I hardly recognized you.
323;00:27:24,131;00:27:26,421;My deepest sympathies.
324;00:27:26,422;00:27:29,546;I apologize
324;00:27:26,422;00:27:29,546;for my son's appearance.
325;00:27:29,547;00:27:30,668;Uncle, it's quite all right.
326;00:27:34,089;00:27:36,130;They call themselves sparrows.
327;00:27:36,131;00:27:38,838;Bloody fanatics.
328;00:27:38,839;00:27:40,838;Religion has its place,
328;00:27:38,839;00:27:40,838;of course,
329;00:27:40,839;00:27:43,671;but at a certain point...
330;00:27:43,672;00:27:46,630;They never would have come to the capital
330;00:27:43,672;00:27:46,630;when Tywin was alive.
331;00:27:46,631;00:27:48,296;I'm sure he'll grow out of it,
332;00:27:48,297;00:27:50,296;whatever it is.
333;00:27:50,297;00:27:52,839;Excuse me.
333;00:27:50,297;00:27:52,839;Of course.
334;00:28:11,256;00:28:13,963;Your wounds from the Blackwater
334;00:28:11,256;00:28:13,963;seem to have healed.
335;00:28:13,964;00:28:16,339;It wasn't my wounds
335;00:28:13,964;00:28:16,339;that needed healing.
336;00:28:19,047;00:28:21,964;What can I do for you?
337;00:28:22,964;00:28:25,213;You can forgive me.
338;00:28:25,214;00:28:28,046;What could you possibly
338;00:28:25,214;00:28:28,046;have done to warrant my forgiveness?
339;00:28:28,047;00:28:30,755;I led you into the darkness.
340;00:28:30,756;00:28:32,171;I doubt you've ever
340;00:28:30,756;00:28:32,171;led anyone anywhere.
341;00:28:32,172;00:28:34,963;I tempted you into our...
342;00:28:34,964;00:28:38,214;unnatural relations.
343;00:28:39,756;00:28:42,214;And, of course,
343;00:28:39,756;00:28:42,214;there was the king...
344;00:28:43,797;00:28:46,631;his boar hunt.
345;00:28:48,631;00:28:49,714;His wine.
346;00:28:53,381;00:28:55,255;I don't know what
346;00:28:53,381;00:28:55,255;you're talking about.
347;00:28:55,256;00:28:58,506;I'm a different person now.
348;00:29:00,297;00:29:03,046;I've found peace
348;00:29:00,297;00:29:03,046;in the light of the Seven.
349;00:29:03,047;00:29:04,713;You can, too.
350;00:29:04,714;00:29:06,338;They watch over all of us,
351;00:29:06,339;00:29:08,880;ready to dole out mercy
352;00:29:08,881;00:29:10,381;or justice.
353;00:29:13,256;00:29:16,131;Their world is at hand.
354;00:29:18,881;00:29:20,546;I will pray for
354;00:29:18,881;00:29:20,546;your father's soul.
355;00:29:23,131;00:29:26,714;The day Tywin Lannister's
355;00:29:23,131;00:29:26,714;soul needs your help...
356;00:29:35,547;00:29:38,005;It looks like Dorne.
356;00:29:35,547;00:29:38,005;It doesn't.
357;00:29:38,006;00:29:40,921;It does.
358;00:29:40,922;00:29:45,047;That's the--
358;00:29:40,922;00:29:45,047;that's the Sunspear bit right there.
359;00:29:46,256;00:29:47,963;And that's where
359;00:29:46,256;00:29:47,963;the mountains are.
360;00:29:47,964;00:29:51,296;And over here is--
361;00:29:51,297;00:29:54,088;is Sunsnake?
362;00:29:54,089;00:29:54,713;Stonespear?
363;00:29:54,714;00:29:57,213;Sandstone.
364;00:29:57,214;00:29:58,796;Yes.
365;00:29:58,797;00:30:01,213;Yes, Sandstone.
366;00:30:02,631;00:30:03,963;Just there.
367;00:30:03,964;00:30:05,964;Fine.
368;00:30:08,672;00:30:09,339;It's Dorne.
369;00:30:11,631;00:30:13,838;We should go there.
370;00:30:13,839;00:30:16,213;I think we would
370;00:30:13,839;00:30:16,213;have a lovely time,
371;00:30:16,214;00:30:18,588;judging by my experience.
372;00:30:18,589;00:30:23,338;That would be wonderful.
372;00:30:18,589;00:30:23,338;Dorne, Highgarden.
373;00:30:23,339;00:30:24,881;Anywhere but here.
374;00:30:34,006;00:30:35,922;We're late for dinner as it is.
375;00:30:36,714;00:30:38,338;You're very respectful.
376;00:30:38,339;00:30:39,214;I'm very hungry.
377;00:30:56,881;00:30:59,671;What's your name?
378;00:30:59,672;00:31:01,338;Olyvar, my lady.
379;00:31:01,339;00:31:03,171;I'm afraid my brother
380;00:31:03,172;00:31:06,631;is keeping the king
380;00:31:03,172;00:31:06,631;waiting, Olyvar.
381;00:31:15,506;00:31:17,339;My lady.
382;00:31:29,839;00:31:33,588;Perhaps you might
382;00:31:29,839;00:31:33,588;consider being a bit more discreet?
383;00:31:33,589;00:31:35,338;Why?
384;00:31:35,339;00:31:37,671;They all know about me anyway.
385;00:31:37,672;00:31:40,963;Everybody knows everything
385;00:31:37,672;00:31:40,963;about everyone.
386;00:31:40,964;00:31:44,130;What's the point in trying to
386;00:31:40,964;00:31:44,130;keep a secret in a place like this?
387;00:31:44,131;00:31:47,422;In any event, you shouldn't
387;00:31:44,131;00:31:47,422;keep your intended waiting.
388;00:31:48,131;00:31:50,838;My intended?
388;00:31:48,131;00:31:50,838;Please.
389;00:31:50,839;00:31:52,255;Tywin's dead.
390;00:31:52,256;00:31:54,671;That means no one
390;00:31:52,256;00:31:54,671;can force Cersei to marry me.
391;00:31:54,672;00:31:56,880;Lucky you.
391;00:31:54,672;00:31:56,880;Unlucky you.
392;00:31:56,881;00:31:58,338;You think I want that woman
392;00:31:56,881;00:31:58,338;married to my brother?
393;00:31:58,339;00:32:02,421;If she doesn't marry me,
393;00:31:58,339;00:32:02,421;she doesn't go to Highgarden.
394;00:32:02,422;00:32:05,130;Which means she stays
394;00:32:02,422;00:32:05,130;in King's Landing.
395;00:32:05,131;00:32:07,713;Which means you're trapped here with
395;00:32:05,131;00:32:07,713;Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.
396;00:32:07,714;00:32:09,297;Perhaps.
397;00:32:11,339;00:32:13,380;Perhaps?
398;00:32:13,381;00:32:14,214;Perhaps.
399;00:32:27,922;00:32:31,796;Eunuch, the Spider, the
399;00:32:27,922;00:32:31,796;Master of Whisperers.
400;00:32:31,797;00:32:35,089;Imp, Half-man.
401;00:32:37,422;00:32:39,755;There are faster ways
401;00:32:37,422;00:32:39,755;to kill yourself.
402;00:32:39,756;00:32:41,505;Not for a coward.
403;00:32:41,506;00:32:43,546;You are many things, my friend,
404;00:32:43,547;00:32:45,297;but not a coward.
405;00:32:49,256;00:32:51,630;You never told me
405;00:32:49,256;00:32:51,630;why you set me free.
406;00:32:51,631;00:32:54,630;Your brother asked me to.
407;00:32:54,631;00:32:55,880;Could have said no.
408;00:32:55,881;00:32:59,130;Refuse the Kingslayer?
408;00:32:55,881;00:32:59,130;A dangerous proposition.
409;00:32:59,131;00:33:01,380;Not as dangerous
409;00:32:59,131;00:33:01,380;as releasing me.
410;00:33:01,381;00:33:04,088;You risked your life,
410;00:33:01,381;00:33:04,088;your position, everything.
411;00:33:04,089;00:33:06,755;Why? You're not family.
411;00:33:04,089;00:33:06,755;You owe me nothing.
412;00:33:06,756;00:33:08,338;I didn't do it for you.
413;00:33:08,339;00:33:11,380;I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
414;00:33:11,381;00:33:14,630;A drunken dwarf will never be the savior
414;00:33:11,381;00:33:14,630;of the Seven Kingdoms.
415;00:33:14,631;00:33:16,880;I don't believe in saviors.
416;00:33:16,881;00:33:20,256;I believe men of talent
416;00:33:16,881;00:33:20,256;have a part to play in the war to come.
417;00:33:22,047;00:33:23,671;You're going to have
417;00:33:22,047;00:33:23,671;to find another soldier.
418;00:33:23,672;00:33:27,755;I'm done with Westeros
418;00:33:23,672;00:33:27,755;and Westeros is done with me.
419;00:33:27,756;00:33:30,963;You have many
419;00:33:27,756;00:33:30,963;admirable qualities,
420;00:33:30,964;00:33:32,338;self-pity is not
420;00:33:30,964;00:33:32,338;one of them.
421;00:33:32,339;00:33:34,630;Any fool with a bit of luck
422;00:33:34,631;00:33:38,171;can find himself
422;00:33:34,631;00:33:38,171;born into power.
423;00:33:38,172;00:33:41,838;But earning it for yourself,
423;00:33:38,172;00:33:41,838;that takes work.
424;00:33:41,839;00:33:44,380;I'm not well-suited
424;00:33:41,839;00:33:44,380;for work.
425;00:33:44,381;00:33:46,005;I think you are.
426;00:33:46,006;00:33:48,088;You have your father's
426;00:33:46,006;00:33:48,088;instincts for politics.
427;00:33:48,089;00:33:49,671;And you have compassion.
428;00:33:49,672;00:33:52,880;Compassion? Yes.
429;00:33:52,881;00:33:55,505;I killed my lover
429;00:33:52,881;00:33:55,505;with my bare hands.
430;00:33:55,506;00:33:59,296;I shot my own father
430;00:33:55,506;00:33:59,296;with a crossbow.
431;00:33:59,297;00:34:01,338;I never said you were perfect.
432;00:34:01,339;00:34:05,296;What is it you want exactly?
433;00:34:05,297;00:34:07,296;Peace.
434;00:34:07,297;00:34:08,755;Prosperity.
435;00:34:08,756;00:34:12,838;A land where the powerful
435;00:34:08,756;00:34:12,838;do not prey on the powerless.
436;00:34:12,839;00:34:15,296;Where the castles
436;00:34:12,839;00:34:15,296;are made of gingerbread
437;00:34:15,297;00:34:17,796;and the moats are filled
437;00:34:15,297;00:34:17,796;with blackberry wine.
438;00:34:17,797;00:34:20,088;The powerful have always
438;00:34:17,797;00:34:20,088;preyed on the powerless.
439;00:34:20,089;00:34:22,505;That's how they became powerful
439;00:34:20,089;00:34:22,505;in the first place.
440;00:34:22,506;00:34:24,421;Perhaps.
441;00:34:24,422;00:34:28,005;And perhaps we've grown
441;00:34:24,422;00:34:28,005;so used to horror,
442;00:34:28,006;00:34:29,631;we assume there's no other way.
443;00:34:30,714;00:34:33,421;If you sat on the Iron Throne,
444;00:34:33,422;00:34:35,588;would you spread misery
444;00:34:33,422;00:34:35,588;throughout the land?
445;00:34:35,589;00:34:38,005;I will never sit
445;00:34:35,589;00:34:38,005;on the Iron Throne.
446;00:34:38,006;00:34:40,421;No, you won't.
447;00:34:40,422;00:34:42,796;But you could help another
447;00:34:40,422;00:34:42,796;climb those steps
448;00:34:42,797;00:34:45,296;and take that seat.
449;00:34:45,297;00:34:48,338;The Seven Kingdoms
449;00:34:45,297;00:34:48,338;need someone stronger than Tommen,
450;00:34:48,339;00:34:50,630;but gentler than Stannis.
451;00:34:50,631;00:34:53,546;A monarch who can intimidate the
451;00:34:50,631;00:34:53,546;high lords and inspire the people.
452;00:34:53,547;00:34:57,630;A ruler loved by millions
452;00:34:53,547;00:34:57,630;with a powerful army
453;00:34:57,631;00:34:59,505;and the right family name.
454;00:34:59,506;00:35:01,796;Good luck finding him.
455;00:35:01,797;00:35:04,839;Who said anything about him?
456;00:35:08,797;00:35:11,171;You have a choice, my friend.
457;00:35:11,172;00:35:13,171;You can stay here
457;00:35:11,172;00:35:13,171;at Illyrio's palace
458;00:35:13,172;00:35:15,755;and drink yourself to death,
459;00:35:15,756;00:35:17,088;or you can ride with me
459;00:35:15,756;00:35:17,088;to Meereen,
460;00:35:17,089;00:35:19,546;meet Daenerys Targaryen,
461;00:35:19,547;00:35:21,964;and decide if the world
461;00:35:19,547;00:35:21,964;is worth fighting for.
462;00:35:23,714;00:35:28,047;Can I drink myself to death
462;00:35:23,714;00:35:28,047;on the road to Meereen?
463;00:35:38,089;00:35:41,588;When did the Unsullied
463;00:35:38,089;00:35:41,588;start patrolling the streets of Meereen?
464;00:35:41,589;00:35:44,422;Looks like your friends haven't
464;00:35:41,589;00:35:44,422;been behaving themselves.
465;00:35:46,756;00:35:50,588;Our mission to Yunkai
465;00:35:46,756;00:35:50,588;was a resounding success.
466;00:35:50,589;00:35:53,171;The Wise Masters of Yunkai
466;00:35:50,589;00:35:53,171;have agreed to cede power
467;00:35:53,172;00:35:55,046;to a council of elders
467;00:35:53,172;00:35:55,046;made up of both
468;00:35:55,047;00:35:57,463;the freed men and
468;00:35:55,047;00:35:57,463;the former slaveholders.
469;00:35:57,464;00:35:59,588;All matters of consequence will be
469;00:35:57,464;00:35:59,588;brought to you for review.
470;00:35:59,589;00:36:01,338;Good.
471;00:36:01,339;00:36:03,880;They did ask
471;00:36:01,339;00:36:03,880;for some concessions.
472;00:36:03,881;00:36:05,630;Concessions?
473;00:36:05,631;00:36:08,713;Politics is the art
473;00:36:05,631;00:36:08,713;of compromise, Your Grace.
474;00:36:08,714;00:36:11,630;I'm not a politician.
474;00:36:08,714;00:36:11,630;I'm a queen.
475;00:36:11,631;00:36:14,880;Forgive me.
475;00:36:11,631;00:36:14,880;You're right, of course.
476;00:36:14,881;00:36:19,296;Still, it's easier to rule happy
476;00:36:14,881;00:36:19,296;subjects than angry ones.
477;00:36:19,297;00:36:21,296;I don't expect
477;00:36:19,297;00:36:21,296;the Wise Masters to be happy.
478;00:36:21,297;00:36:23,671;Slavery made them rich.
478;00:36:21,297;00:36:23,671;I ended slavery.
479;00:36:23,672;00:36:26,755;They do not ask
479;00:36:23,672;00:36:26,755;for the return of slavery.
480;00:36:26,756;00:36:29,339;They ask for the reopening
480;00:36:26,756;00:36:29,339;of the fighting pits.
481;00:36:31,256;00:36:33,005;The fighting pits?
482;00:36:33,006;00:36:34,505;Where slaves fought
482;00:36:33,006;00:36:34,505;slaves to the death?
483;00:36:34,506;00:36:37,380;In the new world
483;00:36:34,506;00:36:37,380;that you've brought to us,
484;00:36:37,381;00:36:39,714;free men would fight free men.
485;00:36:41,214;00:36:42,630;The pit fighters you liberated
486;00:36:42,631;00:36:44,713;plead for this opportunity.
487;00:36:44,714;00:36:47,046;Bring some here
487;00:36:44,714;00:36:47,046;and ask them yourself.
488;00:36:47,047;00:36:48,255;No fighting pits.
489;00:36:48,256;00:36:49,588;Opening them would show
489;00:36:48,256;00:36:49,588;the people of Yunkai
490;00:36:49,589;00:36:52,546;and Meereen that you
490;00:36:49,589;00:36:52,546;respect their traditions.
491;00:36:52,547;00:36:54,963;I do not respect the tradition of
491;00:36:52,547;00:36:54,963;human cockfighting.
492;00:36:54,964;00:36:58,214;If you-- - How many times must I say no
492;00:36:54,964;00:36:58,214;before you understand?
493;00:37:00,631;00:37:04,005;Whatever he wants from me,
493;00:37:00,631;00:37:04,005;he's not going to get it.
494;00:37:04,006;00:37:06,546;If he really believes
494;00:37:04,006;00:37:06,546;I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...
495;00:37:06,547;00:37:08,713;You should reopen
495;00:37:06,547;00:37:08,713;the fighting pits.
496;00:37:08,714;00:37:11,588;What?
497;00:37:11,589;00:37:13,214;My mother was a whore.
497;00:37:11,589;00:37:13,214;I told you that.
498;00:37:15,297;00:37:17,963;She liked to drink pear brandy.
499;00:37:17,964;00:37:22,046;The older she got, the less
499;00:37:17,964;00:37:22,046;she made selling her body,
500;00:37:22,047;00:37:24,421;the more she wanted to drink.
501;00:37:24,422;00:37:27,630;So one day when I was 12,
501;00:37:24,422;00:37:27,630;she sold me to a slaver
502;00:37:27,631;00:37:30,255;she fucked the night before.
503;00:37:30,256;00:37:32,546;I'm sorry.
504;00:37:32,547;00:37:35,296;Why?
504;00:37:32,547;00:37:35,296;I was a bad child.
505;00:37:35,297;00:37:38,088;I wasn't big, but I was quick.
506;00:37:38,089;00:37:40,380;And I loved to fight.
507;00:37:40,381;00:37:42,380;So they sold me
507;00:37:40,381;00:37:42,380;to a man in Tolos
508;00:37:42,381;00:37:44,546;who trained fighters
508;00:37:42,381;00:37:44,546;for the pits.
509;00:37:44,547;00:37:47,171;I had my first match
509;00:37:44,547;00:37:47,171;when I was 16.
510;00:37:47,172;00:37:49,338;You were sold into slavery,
511;00:37:49,339;00:37:51,796;forced to fight to the death
511;00:37:49,339;00:37:51,796;for the amusement of the masters,
512;00:37:51,797;00:37:53,317;and you're defending
512;00:37:51,797;00:37:53,317;the fighting pits?
513;00:37:55,006;00:37:57,796;I'm only here
513;00:37:55,006;00:37:57,796;because of those pits.
514;00:37:57,797;00:38:00,421;I learned to fight
514;00:37:57,797;00:38:00,421;like a Dothraki screamer,
515;00:38:00,422;00:38:01,838;a Norvoshi priest,
515;00:38:00,422;00:38:01,838;a Westerosi knight.
516;00:38:01,839;00:38:04,463;Soon I was famous.
517;00:38:04,464;00:38:06,713;10,000 men and women
517;00:38:04,464;00:38:06,713;screamed my name
518;00:38:06,714;00:38:07,796;when I stepped into the pit.
519;00:38:07,797;00:38:09,296;I made so much money
519;00:38:07,797;00:38:09,296;for my master,
520;00:38:09,297;00:38:12,088;he set me free when he died.
521;00:38:12,089;00:38:13,880;I joined the Second Sons.
522;00:38:13,881;00:38:16,797;And then I met you.
523;00:38:22,297;00:38:23,630;You're the queen.
524;00:38:23,631;00:38:27,171;Everyone's too afraid
524;00:38:23,631;00:38:27,171;of you to speak truth.
525;00:38:27,172;00:38:29,755;Everyone but me.
526;00:38:29,756;00:38:33,963;You've made thousands
526;00:38:29,756;00:38:33,963;of enemies all across the world.
527;00:38:33,964;00:38:36,755;As soon as they see weakness,
528;00:38:36,756;00:38:39,005;they'll attack.
529;00:38:39,006;00:38:42,546;Show your strength here, now.
530;00:38:42,547;00:38:44,708;That's why I have the Unsullied
530;00:38:42,547;00:38:44,708;patrolling the streets.
531;00:38:46,922;00:38:50,463;Anyone with a chest
531;00:38:46,922;00:38:50,463;full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied.
532;00:38:50,464;00:38:54,213;You're not
532;00:38:50,464;00:38:54,213;the Mother of Unsullied.
533;00:38:54,214;00:38:55,374;You're the Mother of Dragons.
534;00:39:03,047;00:39:06,922;I don't want another child's bones
534;00:39:03,047;00:39:06,922;dropped at my feet.
535;00:39:07,922;00:39:10,796;No one's seen Drogon in weeks.
536;00:39:10,797;00:39:13,256;For all I know, he's flown halfway
536;00:39:10,797;00:39:13,256;across the world.
537;00:39:18,214;00:39:20,339;I can't control them anymore.
538;00:39:21,756;00:39:25,296;A dragon queen with no dragons
539;00:39:25,297;00:39:26,422;is not a queen.
540;00:40:32,839;00:40:35,131;Viserion?
541;00:40:37,131;00:40:39,006;Rhaegal?
542;00:40:51,006;00:40:52,546;Easy. Easy.
543;00:40:52,547;00:40:54,713;Easy.
544;00:41:34,131;00:41:36,338;So here we are.
545;00:41:36,339;00:41:37,422;Here we are.
546;00:41:40,214;00:41:44,005;When we first met,
546;00:41:40,214;00:41:44,005;you were my prisoner.
547;00:41:44,006;00:41:46,214;And now, for our last meeting...
548;00:41:48,547;00:41:52,005;This doesn't have to be
548;00:41:48,547;00:41:52,005;our last meeting.
549;00:41:52,006;00:41:54,422;No, but it will be.
550;00:41:56,964;00:41:59,296;You know what Stannis wants?
551;00:41:59,297;00:42:01,838;He wants me to bend the knee.
552;00:42:01,839;00:42:04,213;And he wants the free folk
552;00:42:01,839;00:42:04,213;to fight for him.
553;00:42:04,214;00:42:07,421;I'll give him this much,
554;00:42:07,422;00:42:08,755;he's bold.
555;00:42:08,756;00:42:10,296;Shouldn't a king be bold?
556;00:42:10,297;00:42:12,380;Oh, aye.
557;00:42:12,381;00:42:15,505;I respect him.
558;00:42:15,506;00:42:17,046;If he gets what he wants,
559;00:42:17,047;00:42:18,755;I expect he'll be a better ruler
559;00:42:17,047;00:42:18,755;than the fools
560;00:42:18,756;00:42:22,671;sitting on the Iron Throne
560;00:42:18,756;00:42:22,671;the last hundred years.
561;00:42:22,672;00:42:25,131;But I'll never serve him.
562;00:42:26,381;00:42:28,171;You told me you weren't
562;00:42:26,381;00:42:28,171;here to conquer.
563;00:42:28,172;00:42:29,505;You told me your people
563;00:42:28,172;00:42:29,505;have bled enough.
564;00:42:29,506;00:42:31,130;That's right.
565;00:42:31,131;00:42:34,421;I don't want them bleeding for
565;00:42:31,131;00:42:34,421;Stannis Baratheon either.
566;00:42:34,422;00:42:37,880;You spent your life convincing
566;00:42:34,422;00:42:37,880;90 clans to come together
567;00:42:37,881;00:42:38,963;for the first time in history.
568;00:42:38,964;00:42:42,130;Thenns and Hornfoots,
569;00:42:42,131;00:42:45,213;the ice-river clans,
569;00:42:42,131;00:42:45,213;even the giants.
570;00:42:45,214;00:42:48,213;A life's work uniting them.
570;00:42:45,214;00:42:48,213;You didn't do it for power.
571;00:42:48,214;00:42:51,588;You didn't do it for glory.
572;00:42:51,589;00:42:53,755;You brought them
572;00:42:51,589;00:42:53,755;together to save them
573;00:42:53,756;00:42:55,296;because none of them
573;00:42:53,756;00:42:55,296;will survive the winter,
574;00:42:55,297;00:42:57,171;not if they're north
574;00:42:55,297;00:42:57,171;of the Wall.
575;00:42:57,172;00:42:59,171;Isn't their survival
575;00:42:57,172;00:42:59,171;more important than your pride?
576;00:42:59,172;00:43:01,006;Pride?
577;00:43:03,172;00:43:05,714;Fuck my pride.
578;00:43:07,006;00:43:09,297;This isn't about that.
579;00:43:11,797;00:43:14,422;Then bend the knee
579;00:43:11,797;00:43:14,422;and save your people.
580;00:43:17,297;00:43:20,546;They followed me
580;00:43:17,297;00:43:20,546;because they respected me.
581;00:43:20,547;00:43:22,505;Because they believed in me.
582;00:43:22,506;00:43:24,880;The moment I kneel
582;00:43:22,506;00:43:24,880;for a southern king, that's all gone.
583;00:43:24,881;00:43:28,171;And how many tens of thousands
583;00:43:24,881;00:43:28,171;are out there right now?
584;00:43:28,172;00:43:31,421;How many women?
584;00:43:28,172;00:43:31,421;How many children?
585;00:43:31,422;00:43:34,463;And you won't go out and rescue
585;00:43:31,422;00:43:34,463;them because why?
586;00:43:34,464;00:43:36,671;You're afraid of looking afraid.
587;00:43:36,672;00:43:39,506;Oh, I am afraid.
588;00:43:40,131;00:43:42,297;No shame in that.
589;00:43:51,672;00:43:55,588;How will they do it?
589;00:43:51,672;00:43:55,588;Beheading?
590;00:43:55,589;00:43:57,464;Hanging?
591;00:44:00,172;00:44:02,756;They'll burn you alive.
592;00:44:07,422;00:44:09,214;Bad way to go.
593;00:44:13,339;00:44:15,171;I'll be honest with you.
594;00:44:15,172;00:44:17,171;I don't want to die.
595;00:44:17,172;00:44:19,338;And burnt to death,
596;00:44:19,339;00:44:21,296;I don't want people
596;00:44:19,339;00:44:21,296;to remember me like that,
597;00:44:21,297;00:44:23,171;scorched and screaming.
598;00:44:23,172;00:44:25,963;But it's better than betraying
599;00:44:25,964;00:44:27,671;everything I believe.
600;00:44:27,672;00:44:30,130;And what happens to your people?
601;00:44:30,131;00:44:33,880;You preserve your dignity
601;00:44:30,131;00:44:33,880;and die standing
602;00:44:33,881;00:44:36,296;and they'll sing
602;00:44:33,881;00:44:36,296;songs about you.
603;00:44:36,297;00:44:37,755;You'd rather burn than kneel.
604;00:44:37,756;00:44:39,422;The great hero.
605;00:44:42,256;00:44:45,130;Until winter comes and
605;00:44:42,256;00:44:45,130;the white walkers come for us all
606;00:44:45,131;00:44:47,797;and there's no one left to sing.
607;00:44:50,214;00:44:51,796;You're a good lad.
608;00:44:51,797;00:44:54,963;Truly you are.
609;00:44:54,964;00:45:00,005;But if you can't understand why I won't
609;00:44:54,964;00:45:00,005;enlist my people
610;00:45:00,006;00:45:02,755;in a foreigner's war,
611;00:45:02,756;00:45:04,756;there's no point explaining.
612;00:45:21,339;00:45:23,338;I think you're making
612;00:45:21,339;00:45:23,338;a terrible mistake.
613;00:45:25,172;00:45:27,713;The freedom to make
613;00:45:25,172;00:45:27,713;my own mistakes
614;00:45:27,714;00:45:29,381;was all I ever wanted.
615;00:46:39,089;00:46:42,713;Mance Rayder, you've been called
615;00:46:39,089;00:46:42,713;the King-beyond-the-Wall.
616;00:46:42,714;00:46:45,463;Westeros only has one king.
617;00:46:45,464;00:46:47,797;Bend the knee,
617;00:46:45,464;00:46:47,797;I promise you mercy.
618;00:47:01,339;00:47:03,464;Kneel and live.
619;00:47:10,839;00:47:14,631;This was my home for many years.
620;00:47:16,381;00:47:17,963;I wish you good fortune
621;00:47:17,964;00:47:20,631;in the wars to come.
622;00:48:02,006;00:48:05,046;We all must choose.
623;00:48:05,047;00:48:09,630;Man or woman, young or old,
624;00:48:09,631;00:48:13,046;lord or peasant,
624;00:48:09,631;00:48:13,046;our choices are the same.
625;00:48:13,047;00:48:16,546;We choose light
625;00:48:13,047;00:48:16,546;or we choose darkness.
626;00:48:16,547;00:48:19,588;We choose good
626;00:48:16,547;00:48:19,588;or we choose evil.
627;00:48:19,589;00:48:24,297;We choose the true god
627;00:48:19,589;00:48:24,297;or the false.
628;00:48:35,256;00:48:37,171;Free folk,
629;00:48:37,172;00:48:39,588;there is only one true king
630;00:48:39,589;00:48:42,713;and his name is Stannis.
631;00:48:42,714;00:48:45,171;Here stands your king of lies.
632;00:48:45,172;00:48:48,297;Behold the fate of those
632;00:48:45,172;00:48:48,297;who choose the darkness.
