1;00:00:01,578;00:00:03,827;We have suffered at each other's hands.
2;00:00:04,494;00:00:07,202;We have lost people
2;00:00:04,494;00:00:07,202;we love at each other's hands.
3;00:00:10,077;00:00:11,869;This isn't about noble houses,
4;00:00:12,244;00:00:14,536;this is about the living and the dead.
5;00:00:14,619;00:00:16,244;And I intend to stay
5;00:00:14,619;00:00:16,244;amongst the living.
6;00:00:17,994;00:00:19,619;I offer you a choice.
7;00:00:19,827;00:00:21,327;Bend the knee and join me,
8;00:00:21,619;00:00:23,536;or refuse, and die.
9;00:00:27,827;00:00:30,077;She is here to reclaim
9;00:00:27,827;00:00:30,077;the Seven Kingdoms.
10;00:00:30,286;00:00:32,244;The North is one of
10;00:00:30,286;00:00:32,244;those seven kingdoms.
11;00:00:34,327;00:00:37,077;The Night King's army
11;00:00:34,327;00:00:37,077;grows larger by the day.
12;00:00:41,035;00:00:43,286;We need allies. Powerful allies.
13;00:00:49,411;00:00:50,785;The monsters are real.
14;00:00:52,077;00:00:54,910;Dragons, White Walkers,
14;00:00:52,077;00:00:54,910;Dothraki screamers...
15;00:00:56,161;00:00:57,481;Let the monsters kill each other.
16;00:00:57,827;00:00:59,661;We will deal with whatever is left.
17;00:01:03,077;00:01:04,869;We are going to destroy the Night King
18;00:01:04,952;00:01:06,910;and his army, and we'll do it together.
19;00:01:08,453;00:01:11,119;He pledged to fight
19;00:01:08,453;00:01:11,119;for Daenerys Targaryen.
20;00:01:11,411;00:01:12,411;He's bent the knee.
21;00:01:12,869;00:01:14,578;He needs to know the truth.
22;00:01:17,286;00:01:18,994;Jon isn't really my father's son.
23;00:01:19,578;00:01:21,453;He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen,
24;00:01:21,661;00:01:23,286;and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.
25;00:01:24,453;00:01:26,161;He's the heir to the Iron Throne.
26;00:01:26,744;00:01:28,119;We need to tell him.
27;00:01:33,244;00:01:35,744;The same thing
27;00:01:33,244;00:01:35,744;is coming for all of us...
28;00:01:38,785;00:01:39,827;And it is here.

30;00:06:21,785;00:06:23,703;You should consider yourself lucky.
31;00:06:25,244;00:06:27,077;At least your balls won't freeze off.
32;00:06:27,161;00:06:29,286;You take great offense at dwarf jokes,
33;00:06:29,369;00:06:31,910;but love telling eunuch jokes.
33;00:06:29,369;00:06:31,910;Why is that?
34;00:06:33,161;00:06:36,077;Because I have balls, and you don't.
35;00:07:03,619;00:07:05,119;I warned you.
36;00:07:05,202;00:07:07,952;Northerners don't much trust outsiders.
37;00:08:29,578;00:08:31,119;Look at you.
38;00:08:32,286;00:08:33,536;You're a man.
39;00:08:34,536;00:08:35,578;Almost.
40;00:08:55,244;00:08:58,119;Where's Arya?
40;00:08:55,244;00:08:58,119;Lurking somewhere.
41;00:09:04,744;00:09:07,202;Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
42;00:09:08,494;00:09:12,327;My sister, Sansa Stark,
42;00:09:08,494;00:09:12,327;the Lady of Winterfell.
43;00:09:12,411;00:09:15,369;Thank you for inviting us
43;00:09:12,411;00:09:15,369;into your home, Lady Stark.
44;00:09:15,453;00:09:16,827;The North is as beautiful
45;00:09:16,910;00:09:20,244;as your brother claimed, as are you.
46;00:09:23,744;00:09:26,119;Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.
47;00:09:27,578;00:09:29,411;We don't have time for all this.
48;00:09:29,494;00:09:33,286;The Night King has your dragon.
48;00:09:29,494;00:09:33,286;He's one of them now.
49;00:09:34,286;00:09:35,744;The Wall has fallen,
50;00:09:35,827;00:09:37,994;the dead march south.
51;00:09:43,286;00:09:45,202;As soon as we heard about the Wall,
52;00:09:45,286;00:09:48,411;I called all our banners
52;00:09:45,286;00:09:48,411;to retreat to Winterfell.
53;00:09:49,661;00:09:50,661;Lord Umber...
54;00:09:51,994;00:09:54,952;when can we expect
54;00:09:51,994;00:09:54,952;your people to arrive?
55;00:09:59,161;00:10:03,119;We need more horses and wagons,
55;00:09:59,161;00:10:03,119;if it please my lady.
56;00:10:05,453;00:10:07,077;And my lord.
57;00:10:09,411;00:10:12,910;And my queen.
57;00:10:09,411;00:10:12,910;Sorry.
58;00:10:12,994;00:10:14,952;You'll have as many as we can spare.
59;00:10:15,035;00:10:18,244;Hurry back to Last Hearth
59;00:10:15,035;00:10:18,244;and bring your people here.
60;00:10:21,161;00:10:23,952;We need to send ravens
60;00:10:21,161;00:10:23,952;to the Night's Watch as well.
61;00:10:24,035;00:10:26,494;There's no sense in
61;00:10:24,035;00:10:26,494;manning the castles anymore.
62;00:10:26,578;00:10:27,661;We make our stand here.
63;00:10:27,744;00:10:28,827;At once, Your Grace.
64;00:10:29,827;00:10:31,369;Your Grace.
65;00:10:36,994;00:10:38,869;But you're not. Are you?
66;00:10:39,827;00:10:41,327;You left Winterfell a king
67;00:10:41,411;00:10:42,827;and came back a...
68;00:10:45,327;00:10:47,286;I'm not sure what you are now.
69;00:10:47,369;00:10:49,910;A lord?
70;00:10:49,994;00:10:52,286;Nothing at all?
71;00:10:52,369;00:10:54,578;It's not important.
71;00:10:52,369;00:10:54,578;Not important?
72;00:10:55,744;00:10:57,952;We named you King in the North.
73;00:10:59,536;00:11:01,035;King of the North!
74;00:11:06,161;00:11:07,910;You did, my lady.
75;00:11:09,453;00:11:11,286;It was the honor of my life.
76;00:11:11,369;00:11:14,077;I'll always be grateful for your faith.
77;00:11:16,202;00:11:17,453;But when I left Winterfell,
78;00:11:17,536;00:11:20,202;I told you
78;00:11:17,536;00:11:20,202;we need allies or we will die.
79;00:11:21,369;00:11:23,077;I have brought those allies home
80;00:11:23,161;00:11:25,244;to fight alongside us.
81;00:11:26,536;00:11:28,202;I had a choice,
82;00:11:28,286;00:11:32,327;keep my crown or protect the North.
83;00:11:32,411;00:11:34,286;I chose the North.
84;00:11:46,661;00:11:48,994;If anyone survives the war to come,
85;00:11:49,077;00:11:50,744;we'll have Jon Snow to thank.
86;00:11:52,202;00:11:54,661;He risked his life
86;00:11:52,202;00:11:54,661;to show us the threat is real.
87;00:11:54,744;00:11:56,536;Thanks to his courage,
88;00:11:56,619;00:11:58,661;we have brought with us
88;00:11:56,619;00:11:58,661;the greatest army
89;00:11:58,744;00:11:59,827;the world has ever seen.
90;00:11:59,910;00:12:03,119;We have brought
90;00:11:59,910;00:12:03,119;two full-grown dragons.
91;00:12:05,286;00:12:06,661;And soon, the Lannister army
92;00:12:06,744;00:12:08,827;will ride north to join our cause.
93;00:12:13,453;00:12:14,952;I know, I know, our people
94;00:12:15,035;00:12:17,619;haven't been friends in the past.
95;00:12:19,952;00:12:21,661;But we must fight together now...
96;00:12:22,785;00:12:23,785;or die.
97;00:12:25,827;00:12:28,286;May I ask, how are we meant to feed
98;00:12:28,369;00:12:30,327;the greatest army
98;00:12:28,369;00:12:30,327;the world has ever seen?
99;00:12:30,411;00:12:33,035;While I ensured our stores
99;00:12:30,411;00:12:33,035;would last through winter,
100;00:12:33,119;00:12:34,869;I didn't account for Dothraki,
101;00:12:34,952;00:12:38,661;Unsullied
101;00:12:34,952;00:12:38,661;and two full-grown dragons.
102;00:12:40,286;00:12:42,286;What do dragons eat, anyway?
103;00:12:44,453;00:12:45,785;Whatever they want.
104;00:13:04,244;00:13:08,077;Hey, careful, lads.
104;00:13:04,244;00:13:08,077;We need every last bit of it.
105;00:13:08,161;00:13:09,453;Sorry 'bout that.
106;00:13:13,661;00:13:15,286;Are these the last of the wagons?
107;00:13:15,369;00:13:16,785;Aye.
108;00:13:16,869;00:13:19,494;All right, let's get it
108;00:13:16,869;00:13:19,494;all to the forges.
109;00:13:27,494;00:13:28,494;My lord.
110;00:13:30,661;00:13:31,661;My lady.
111;00:13:38,286;00:13:39,327;My lady.
112;00:13:51,327;00:13:52,744;The Lady of Winterfell.
113;00:13:54,578;00:13:56,536;Has a nice ring to it.
114;00:13:56,619;00:13:58,494;So does Hand of the Queen.
115;00:13:59,785;00:14:01,827;Depending on the queen, I suppose.
116;00:14:04,536;00:14:07,244;Last time we spoke
116;00:14:04,536;00:14:07,244;was at Joffrey's wedding.
117;00:14:08,536;00:14:11,327;Miserable affair.
117;00:14:08,536;00:14:11,327;It had its moments.
118;00:14:17,035;00:14:19,327;Apologies for leaving like that.
119;00:14:19,411;00:14:20,952;Yes, it was a bit hard to explain
120;00:14:21,035;00:14:23,785;why my wife fled
120;00:14:21,035;00:14:23,785;moments after the king's murder.
121;00:14:26,369;00:14:27,578;We both survived.
122;00:14:30,536;00:14:32,244;Many underestimated you.
123;00:14:33,494;00:14:35,077;Most of them are dead now.
124;00:14:43,035;00:14:44,744;I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear
125;00:14:44,827;00:14:46,703;the Lannister army's marching north.
126;00:14:48,869;00:14:51,994;You have every right
126;00:14:48,869;00:14:51,994;to be fearful of my sister.
127;00:14:52,077;00:14:53,536;No one fears her more than I do.
128;00:14:53,619;00:14:56,536;But I promise, you'll be safe...
128;00:14:53,619;00:14:56,536;Cersei told you her army
129;00:14:56,619;00:14:59,369;was coming north to fight for you?
130;00:14:59,453;00:15:00,453;She did.
131;00:15:02,077;00:15:03,494;And you believed her?
132;00:15:04,910;00:15:06,619;She has something to live for now.
133;00:15:06,703;00:15:09,494;I believe she wants to survive.
134;00:15:11,952;00:15:14,453;I used to think you were
134;00:15:11,952;00:15:14,453;the cleverest man alive.
135;00:15:46,453;00:15:48,119;You used to be taller.
136;00:15:50,910;00:15:52,453;How did you sneak up on me?
137;00:15:52,536;00:15:55,369;How did you survive
137;00:15:52,536;00:15:55,369;a knife through the heart?
138;00:15:55,453;00:15:56,952;I didn't.
139;00:16:15,286;00:16:16,536;You still have it.
140;00:16:19,744;00:16:20,952;Needle.
141;00:16:22,994;00:16:24,869;Have you ever used it?
142;00:16:25,785;00:16:27,536;Once or twice.
143;00:16:42,869;00:16:44,703;Valyrian steel.
144;00:16:46,286;00:16:47,286;Jealous?
145;00:16:47,327;00:16:50,494;Too heavy for me.
146;00:16:58,661;00:17:00,536;Where were you before?
147;00:17:00,619;00:17:03,327;I could've used your help with Sansa.
148;00:17:05,369;00:17:07,578;She doesn't like your queen, does she?
149;00:17:07,661;00:17:10,411;Sansa thinks
149;00:17:07,661;00:17:10,411;she's smarter than everyone.
150;00:17:11,744;00:17:13,785;She's the smartest person
150;00:17:11,744;00:17:13,785;I've ever met.
151;00:17:15,161;00:17:16,453;Now you're defending her?
152;00:17:16,536;00:17:17,910;You?
153;00:17:19,244;00:17:21,035;I'm defending our family.
154;00:17:22,411;00:17:23,578;So is she.
155;00:17:23,661;00:17:25,077;Yeah.
156;00:17:26,536;00:17:28,119;I'm her family too.
157;00:17:34,161;00:17:35,411;Don't forget that.
158;00:17:53,244;00:17:56,619;Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring
158;00:17:53,244;00:17:56,619;terrible news.
159;00:17:57,785;00:17:59,785;The dead have broken through the Wall.
160;00:18:03,411;00:18:04,661;Good.
161;00:18:38,869;00:18:41,244;Why don't you just
161;00:18:38,869;00:18:41,244;get it over with and kill me?
162;00:18:41,327;00:18:44,286;But we're family.
163;00:18:45,494;00:18:48,244;The last Greyjoys left in the world.
164;00:18:51,161;00:18:53,411;The last ones with balls anyway.
165;00:18:58,369;00:18:59,703;If I kill you...
166;00:19:01,161;00:19:02,661;who can I talk to?
167;00:19:03,578;00:19:04,952;Hmm?
168;00:19:07,494;00:19:09,827;I've got a crew full of mutes.
169;00:19:13,161;00:19:14,869;It gets lonely at sea.
170;00:19:17,619;00:19:19,536;Are we in King's Landing?
171;00:19:19,619;00:19:20,703;Mm.
172;00:19:25,244;00:19:27,369;You picked the losing side.
173;00:19:31,035;00:19:33,703;Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet
173;00:19:31,035;00:19:33,703;somewhere else.
174;00:19:40,785;00:19:43,703;But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.
175;00:19:57,244;00:19:58,994;Twenty-thousand men, is it?
176;00:19:59,077;00:20:02,119;Yes, Your Grace.
176;00:19:59,077;00:20:02,119;A few died in transit.
177;00:20:04,411;00:20:05,910;They cheated at dice.
178;00:20:07,869;00:20:09,827;Or maybe I cheated.
179;00:20:09,910;00:20:11,035;Someone cheated.
180;00:20:13,119;00:20:15,661;They weren't good fighters.
180;00:20:13,119;00:20:15,661;You won't miss them.
181;00:20:15,744;00:20:17,661;Horses?
181;00:20:15,744;00:20:17,661;Two thousand.
182;00:20:17,744;00:20:18,994;And elephants?
183;00:20:19,077;00:20:21,453;Uh, no elephants, Your Grace.
184;00:20:23,077;00:20:24,244;That's disappointing.
185;00:20:25,619;00:20:27,785;I was told the Golden Company
185;00:20:25,619;00:20:27,785;had elephants.
186;00:20:27,869;00:20:30,244;They are excellent beasts, Your Grace,
187;00:20:30,327;00:20:33,827;but not well-suited
187;00:20:30,327;00:20:33,827;to long sea voyages.
188;00:20:33,910;00:20:35,453;In any event, you are most welcome
189;00:20:35,536;00:20:37,703;here in King's Landing,
189;00:20:35,536;00:20:37,703;Captain Strickland.
190;00:20:37,785;00:20:40,994;We look forward to fighting
190;00:20:37,785;00:20:40,994;on your behalf, Your Grace.
191;00:20:51,952;00:20:53,619;Am I most welcome here?
192;00:20:55,119;00:20:57,744;You are a true friend of the crown
193;00:20:57,827;00:20:59,703;and an honored guest.
194;00:20:59,785;00:21:01,035;Good.
195;00:21:01,119;00:21:04,161;As a true friend
195;00:21:01,119;00:21:04,161;and an honored guest...
196;00:21:12,994;00:21:16,161;I was hoping we could talk in private.
197;00:21:17,369;00:21:19,578;After the war.
197;00:21:17,369;00:21:19,578;That was our agreement.
198;00:21:19,661;00:21:23,494;Wars sometimes last years.
199;00:21:24,661;00:21:27,161;You want a whore, buy one.
200;00:21:28,952;00:21:30,327;You want a queen...
201;00:21:31,619;00:21:33,327;earn her.
202;00:21:36,202;00:21:37,202;How?
203;00:21:38,286;00:21:39,619;I've given her justice,
204;00:21:39,703;00:21:42,411;an army and the Iron Fleet,
205;00:21:42,494;00:21:45,536;yet she gives me no sign of affection.
206;00:21:46,494;00:21:48,661;My heart is nearly broken.
207;00:21:50,952;00:21:52,202;You're insolent.
208;00:21:53,910;00:21:58,327;I've executed men for less.
208;00:21:53,910;00:21:58,327;They were lesser men.
209;00:22:37,119;00:22:40,035;I hear the dragon burnt up
209;00:22:37,119;00:22:40,035;a thousand Lannister men.
210;00:22:40,119;00:22:42,035;Burnt up some of my favorite boys.
211;00:22:42,119;00:22:43,785;Archie, was it?
211;00:22:42,119;00:22:43,785;And William.
212;00:22:43,869;00:22:46,869;Tall handsome William?
212;00:22:43,869;00:22:46,869;Yeah, tall handsome William.
213;00:22:46,952;00:22:49,619;They said what's left of him
213;00:22:46,952;00:22:49,619;could fit in a wine glass.
214;00:22:49,703;00:22:53,161;I am the only man you ever met
214;00:22:49,703;00:22:53,161;who shot a dragon.
215;00:22:53,244;00:22:54,994;Did you?
215;00:22:53,244;00:22:54,994;Nearly killed it.
216;00:22:55,077;00:22:56,077;That's brave.
217;00:23:06,369;00:23:08,910;That boy Eddie...
217;00:23:06,369;00:23:08,910;The ginger?
218;00:23:08,994;00:23:12,161;That's him. Came back
218;00:23:08,994;00:23:12,161;with his face burnt right off.
219;00:23:12,244;00:23:13,494;He's got no eyelids now.
220;00:23:13,578;00:23:15,202;How does he sleep with no eyelids?
221;00:23:15,286;00:23:17,785;All right, can we stop talking
221;00:23:15,286;00:23:17,785;about the fucking dragons now?
222;00:23:17,869;00:23:19,744;Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
223;00:23:21,952;00:23:23,035;You're kidding me.
224;00:23:23,119;00:23:24,536;Apologies for the interruption,
225;00:23:24,619;00:23:26,952;but the queen did urge me to hurry.
226;00:23:29,369;00:23:30,578;Sorry, ladies.
227;00:23:32,619;00:23:34,161;Another time perhaps.
228;00:23:41,869;00:23:45,619;You ever get lonely,
228;00:23:41,869;00:23:45,619;I am partial to older gentlemen.
229;00:23:48,661;00:23:51,910;Poor girl. The pox will take her
229;00:23:48,661;00:23:51,910;within the year.
230;00:23:53,536;00:23:55,536;Which girl?
230;00:23:53,536;00:23:55,536;The queen's brothers
231;00:23:55,619;00:23:58,244;made promises to you and broke them.
232;00:23:58,327;00:24:00,619;Her Grace wants to rectify
232;00:23:58,327;00:24:00,619;their mistake.
233;00:24:02,327;00:24:04,744;She once gave me a castle and a wife,
234;00:24:04,827;00:24:06,494;then rectified me right out of them.
235;00:24:06,578;00:24:08,869;That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers.
236;00:24:08,952;00:24:10,827;When Queen Cersei wants something,
237;00:24:10,910;00:24:12,703;she pays in advance and in gold.
238;00:24:12,785;00:24:14,536;Several chests of it, in fact.
239;00:24:14,619;00:24:17,827;Waiting for you
239;00:24:14,619;00:24:17,827;in a wagon just outside.
240;00:24:22,411;00:24:27,244;So she wants to murder someone,
240;00:24:22,411;00:24:27,244;but she can't send her soldiers.
241;00:24:27,327;00:24:29,411;If it's the Dragon Queen she's after...
242;00:24:29,494;00:24:31,578;She has other plans
242;00:24:29,494;00:24:31,578;for the Targaryen girl.
243;00:24:31,661;00:24:33,744;Yeah, well, good luck with that.
244;00:24:33,827;00:24:35,661;Our queen's brothers are unlikely
245;00:24:35,744;00:24:38,077;to survive their Northern adventures.
246;00:24:38,161;00:24:40,494;But in the event that they do...
247;00:24:47,035;00:24:50,703;She has a keen sense of poetic justice.
248;00:24:51,952;00:24:53,785;That fucking family.
249;00:24:53,869;00:24:55,619;When the Citadel expelled me,
250;00:24:55,703;00:24:57,536;I thought I would die poor and alone,
251;00:24:57,619;00:25:01,619;but in exchange for my service,
251;00:24:57,619;00:25:01,619;Queen Cersei made me her Hand.
252;00:25:01,703;00:25:03,578;What would she do for the man
253;00:25:03,661;00:25:06,035;who rids her
253;00:25:03,661;00:25:06,035;of her treasonous brothers?
254;00:25:22,161;00:25:24,536;I wanted those elephants.
255;00:25:30,619;00:25:31,619;So...
256;00:25:33,411;00:25:37,411;how do I compare to the fat king?
257;00:25:38,411;00:25:40,244;You're insulting my late husband?
258;00:25:40,327;00:25:41,578;Are you offended?
259;00:25:46,161;00:25:48,827;Robert had a different whore
259;00:25:46,161;00:25:48,827;every night,
260;00:25:48,910;00:25:51,910;but he still didn't know
260;00:25:48,910;00:25:51,910;his way around a woman's body.
261;00:25:52,869;00:25:53,952;And the Kingslayer?
262;00:25:59,536;00:26:01,578;You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?
263;00:26:03,244;00:26:04,411;Life is boring.
264;00:26:04,494;00:26:07,619;You're not boring, I'll give you that.
265;00:26:19,619;00:26:21,578;Do I please the queen?
266;00:26:23,035;00:26:26,411;You might be the most
266;00:26:23,035;00:26:26,411;arrogant man I've ever met.
267;00:26:28,578;00:26:29,952;I like that.
268;00:26:31,827;00:26:34,286;But now I want to be alone.
269;00:26:40,744;00:26:43,578;I'm going to put a prince in your belly.
270;00:28:17,869;00:28:20,494;Euron can't defend the Iron Islands,
271;00:28:20,578;00:28:24,077;not if he's in King's Landing
271;00:28:20,578;00:28:24,077;with all his men and his ships.
272;00:28:25,202;00:28:26,827;We can take our home back.
273;00:28:26,910;00:28:28,411;Daenerys went north.
274;00:28:28,494;00:28:30,411;Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat
275;00:28:30,494;00:28:32,035;if they can't hold the North.
276;00:28:32,119;00:28:34,869;Somewhere the dead can't go.
277;00:28:40,161;00:28:43,411;You're my queen.
277;00:28:40,161;00:28:43,411;I go where you command.
278;00:28:48,327;00:28:50,327;You want to go to Winterfell.
279;00:28:50,411;00:28:51,910;To fight for the Starks.
280;00:28:55,785;00:28:56,785;Go.
281;00:29:01,578;00:29:03,661;What is dead may never die.
282;00:29:07,161;00:29:09,119;What is dead may never die.
283;00:29:13,827;00:29:16,077;But kill the bastards anyway.
284;00:29:43,869;00:29:45,536;Welcome back, my lady.
285;00:29:46,827;00:29:48,244;If you'd follow me...
286;00:29:48,327;00:29:49,536;The Karstarks.
287;00:29:49,619;00:29:51,785;One of the better sigils.
288;00:29:52,952;00:29:54,327;Beats an onion, anyway.
289;00:29:55,827;00:29:57,411;Can't argue with that.
290;00:29:57,494;00:29:59,619;Not so long ago,
290;00:29:57,494;00:29:59,619;the Starks and the Karstarks
291;00:29:59,703;00:30:02,077;were slaughtering each other
291;00:29:59,703;00:30:02,077;on the battlefield.
292;00:30:02,161;00:30:04,161;Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.
293;00:30:04,244;00:30:06,202;And our queen is grateful.
294;00:30:06,286;00:30:09,536;Her gratitude is lovely,
294;00:30:06,286;00:30:09,536;but that's not my point.
295;00:30:09,619;00:30:12,661;The Northmen are loyal
295;00:30:09,619;00:30:12,661;to Jon Snow, not to her.
296;00:30:12,744;00:30:13,827;They don't know her.
297;00:30:13,910;00:30:16,244;The Free Folk don't know her.
298;00:30:16,327;00:30:19,161;I've been up here a while,
298;00:30:16,327;00:30:19,161;and I'm telling you,
299;00:30:19,244;00:30:21,077;they're stubborn as goats.
300;00:30:21,161;00:30:23,785;You want their loyalty,
300;00:30:21,161;00:30:23,785;you have to earn it.
301;00:30:35,202;00:30:37,703;I sense that you're leading
301;00:30:35,202;00:30:37,703;to a proposal.
302;00:30:38,869;00:30:41,494;A proposal is what I'm proposing.
303;00:30:41,578;00:30:44,952;On the off chance
303;00:30:41,578;00:30:44,952;that we survive the Night King,
304;00:30:45,035;00:30:46,578;what if the Seven Kingdoms,
305;00:30:46,661;00:30:49,077;for once in their whole shit history,
306;00:30:49,161;00:30:52,703;were ruled by a just woman
306;00:30:49,161;00:30:52,703;and an honorable man?
307;00:30:55,161;00:30:56,994;They do make a handsome couple.
308;00:30:57,077;00:30:58,827;You overestimate our influence.
309;00:30:58,910;00:31:02,286;Jon and Daenerys don't want
309;00:30:58,910;00:31:02,286;to listen to lonely old men.
310;00:31:02,369;00:31:04,077;I'm not that old.
311;00:31:05,369;00:31:06,785;Not as old as him.
312;00:31:08,578;00:31:10,952;Our queen respects the wisdom of age.
313;00:31:11,035;00:31:12,411;Of course she does.
314;00:31:12,494;00:31:15,244;Respect is how the young
314;00:31:12,494;00:31:15,244;keep us at a distance,
315;00:31:15,327;00:31:18,827;so we don't remind them
315;00:31:15,327;00:31:18,827;of an unpleasant truth.
316;00:31:18,910;00:31:20,119;What is that?
317;00:31:21,244;00:31:22,619;Nothing lasts.
318;00:31:24,161;00:31:25,244;Hey!
319;00:31:31,619;00:31:34,077;Your sister doesn't like me.
320;00:31:38,619;00:31:39,869;She doesn't know you.
321;00:31:41,785;00:31:43,244;If it makes you feel any better,
322;00:31:43,327;00:31:45,137;she didn't like me either
322;00:31:43,327;00:31:45,137;when we were growing up.
323;00:31:45,161;00:31:47,286;She doesn't need to be my friend...
324;00:31:48,869;00:31:50,785;but I am her queen.
325;00:31:54,286;00:31:56,244;If she can't respect me...
326;00:32:15,119;00:32:16,369;What's the matter?
327;00:32:16,453;00:32:18,952;The dragons are barely eating.
328;00:32:36,327;00:32:37,619;What's wrong with them?
329;00:32:37,703;00:32:39,286;They don't like the North.
330;00:32:55,536;00:32:56,661;Go on.
331;00:33:02,661;00:33:05,119;I don't know how to ride a dragon.
332;00:33:05,202;00:33:07,703;Nobody does.
332;00:33:05,202;00:33:07,703;Until they ride a dragon.
333;00:33:10,202;00:33:11,703;What if he doesn't want me to?
334;00:33:11,785;00:33:14,703;Then I've enjoyed your company,
334;00:33:11,785;00:33:14,703;Jon Snow.
335;00:33:34,202;00:33:35,827;What do I hold onto?
336;00:33:37,286;00:33:38,661;Whatever you can.
337;00:34:55,578;00:34:56,578;Aah!
338;00:35:35,119;00:35:37,453;You've completely ruined horses for me.
339;00:35:46,536;00:35:48,661;We could stay a thousand years...
340;00:35:50,827;00:35:52,161;no one would find us.
341;00:35:54,703;00:35:56,035;We'd be pretty old.
342;00:36:04,202;00:36:07,244;It's cold up here for a southern girl.
343;00:36:07,327;00:36:09,035;So keep your queen warm.
344;00:36:23,744;00:36:24,869;Don't be afraid.
345;00:36:38,411;00:36:39,578;That's good.
346;00:36:48,536;00:36:50,286;Gendry?
346;00:36:48,536;00:36:50,286;He's here.
347;00:36:56,411;00:36:59,286;It isn't easy making a blade
347;00:36:56,411;00:36:59,286;that big with dragonglass.
348;00:37:01,453;00:37:03,744;You're saying you're good, is that it?
349;00:37:03,827;00:37:05,827;I'm just saying
349;00:37:03,827;00:37:05,827;it's a tricky material to...
350;00:37:05,910;00:37:08,952;You know who makes weapons
350;00:37:05,910;00:37:08,952;for the wildlings?
351;00:37:09,035;00:37:11,411;Cripples and cocksuckers.
352;00:37:11,494;00:37:14,077;Which one are you?
352;00:37:11,494;00:37:14,077;Leave him be.
353;00:37:21,286;00:37:22,869;I heard you were here.
354;00:37:25,453;00:37:26,910;You left me to die.
355;00:37:27,952;00:37:29,619;First I robbed you.
356;00:37:41,077;00:37:43,411;You're a cold little bitch, aren't you?
357;00:37:46,952;00:37:49,161;Guess that's why you're still alive.
358;00:37:56,869;00:37:59,453;That was a nice ax you made for him.
359;00:37:59,536;00:38:00,744;You've gotten better.
360;00:38:00,827;00:38:03,286;Yeah, thanks. So have you.
361;00:38:04,494;00:38:06,827;I mean, you look good.
362;00:38:08,327;00:38:10,327;Thanks. So do you.
363;00:38:13,994;00:38:16,827;It's not a bad place to grow up,
363;00:38:13,994;00:38:16,827;if it wasn't so cold.
364;00:38:18,161;00:38:19,869;Stay close to that forge, then.
365;00:38:19,952;00:38:23,578;Is that a command, Lady Stark?
365;00:38:19,952;00:38:23,578;Don't call me that.
366;00:38:23,661;00:38:25,827;As you wish, milady.
367;00:38:33,119;00:38:34,327;Here's my wish.
368;00:38:36,661;00:38:37,785;Can you make it?
369;00:38:37,869;00:38:40,035;What do you need
369;00:38:37,869;00:38:40,035;something like this for?
370;00:38:40,119;00:38:41,369;Can you make it or not?
371;00:38:41,453;00:38:44,327;You already have a sword.
371;00:38:41,453;00:38:44,327;What's that?
372;00:38:50,952;00:38:52,286;It's Valyrian steel.
373;00:38:52,369;00:38:54,744;I always knew
373;00:38:52,369;00:38:54,744;you were just another rich girl.
374;00:38:56,703;00:38:59,244;You don't know any other rich girls.
375;00:39:09,744;00:39:10,744;Come in.
376;00:39:18,286;00:39:20,035;Lord Glover wishes us good fortune,
377;00:39:20,119;00:39:23,453;but he's staying
377;00:39:20,119;00:39:23,453;in Deepwood Motte with his men.
378;00:39:26,035;00:39:28,286;House Glover will stand
378;00:39:26,035;00:39:28,286;behind House Stark
379;00:39:28,369;00:39:30,744;as we have
379;00:39:28,369;00:39:30,744;for a thousand years.
380;00:39:31,910;00:39:33,202;Isn't that what he said?
381;00:39:33,286;00:39:36,202;I will stand behind Jon Snow,
381;00:39:33,286;00:39:36,202;he said.
382;00:39:37,744;00:39:39,077;The King in the North.
383;00:39:40,202;00:39:41,952;I told you we needed allies.
384;00:39:42,035;00:39:45,286;You didn't tell me you were
384;00:39:42,035;00:39:45,286;going to abandon your crown.
385;00:39:45,369;00:39:47,494;I never wanted a crown.
386;00:39:47,578;00:39:50,327;All I wanted was to protect the North.
387;00:39:50,411;00:39:53,161;I brought two armies
387;00:39:50,411;00:39:53,161;home with me, two dragons.
388;00:39:53,244;00:39:54,910;And a Targaryen queen.
389;00:39:54,994;00:39:56,369;Do you think
390;00:39:56,453;00:39:58,661;we can beat the Army of the Dead
390;00:39:56,453;00:39:58,661;without her?
391;00:39:58,744;00:40:01,703;I fought them, Sansa. Twice.
392;00:40:01,785;00:40:03,994;You want to worry about
392;00:40:01,785;00:40:03,994;who holds what title,
393;00:40:04,077;00:40:06,536;I'm telling you it doesn't matter.
394;00:40:06,619;00:40:09,286;Without her, we don't stand a chance.
395;00:40:18,202;00:40:20,785;Do you have any faith in me at all?
396;00:40:22,369;00:40:23,661;You know I do.
397;00:40:28,119;00:40:29,744;She'll be a good queen.
398;00:40:30,827;00:40:31,910;For all of us.
399;00:40:33,578;00:40:35,077;She's not her father.
400;00:40:41,619;00:40:43,286;No, she's much prettier.
401;00:40:48,785;00:40:51,244;Did you bend the knee to save the North
402;00:40:51,327;00:40:52,827;or because you love her?
403;00:41:16,827;00:41:18,119;Oh!
404;00:41:21,536;00:41:22,785;So you're the man?
405;00:41:22,869;00:41:24,327;Um...
406;00:41:24,411;00:41:26,453;Which man am I, Your Grace?
407;00:41:26,536;00:41:29,785;The one who saved Ser Jorah
407;00:41:26,536;00:41:29,785;when no one else could.
408;00:41:29,869;00:41:32,035;They could, they just wouldn't.
409;00:41:33,369;00:41:35,286;I'll have to make some changes
410;00:41:35,369;00:41:37,119;in the Citadel when I take my throne.
411;00:41:37,202;00:41:39,785;A great service merits a great reward.
412;00:41:39,869;00:41:42,536;Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace.
413;00:41:42,619;00:41:45,661;Well, there must be something
413;00:41:42,619;00:41:45,661;I could give you.
414;00:41:47,035;00:41:49,785;If it's not too much trouble,
415;00:41:49,869;00:41:52,286;I could use a pardon.
416;00:41:52,369;00:41:53,619;For what crime?
417;00:41:53,703;00:41:54,869;Um...
418;00:41:54,952;00:41:57,703;I borrowed a few books
418;00:41:54,952;00:41:57,703;from the Citadel.
419;00:42:00,077;00:42:02,119;And also a sword.
420;00:42:02,202;00:42:04,661;From the Citadel?
420;00:42:02,202;00:42:04,661;From my family.
421;00:42:06,202;00:42:08,077;It's been in House Tarly
421;00:42:06,202;00:42:08,077;for generations.
422;00:42:08,161;00:42:11,244;It would've been mine
422;00:42:08,161;00:42:11,244;anyway, eventually,
423;00:42:11,327;00:42:14,286;but my father had other ideas.
424;00:42:16,661;00:42:18,035;Not Randyll Tarly?
425;00:42:19,994;00:42:21,411;You know him?
426;00:42:25,286;00:42:27,994;I offered to let him
426;00:42:25,286;00:42:27,994;retain his lands and titles
427;00:42:28,077;00:42:29,161;if he bent the knee.
428;00:42:32,244;00:42:33,369;He refused.
429;00:42:43,077;00:42:44,411;Well...
430;00:42:46,578;00:42:48,494;At least I'll be allowed home again,
431;00:42:48,578;00:42:50,244;now that my brother's the lord.
432;00:42:54,286;00:42:56,744;Your brother stood with your father.
433;00:43:11,161;00:43:12,286;Hm.
434;00:43:13,785;00:43:15,703;Thank you, Your Grace.
435;00:43:15,785;00:43:17,202;For telling me.
436;00:43:17,286;00:43:19,035;And m...
437;00:43:19,119;00:43:21,661;May I...?
437;00:43:19,119;00:43:21,661;Of course.
438;00:44:04,453;00:44:06,327;What are you doing out here?
439;00:44:07,536;00:44:09,827;Waiting, for an old friend.
440;00:44:11,161;00:44:13,244;It's time to tell Jon the truth.
441;00:44:14,286;00:44:16,286;No, no.
442;00:44:16,369;00:44:20,244;You're his brother.
442;00:44:16,369;00:44:20,244;Shouldn't you tell him?
443;00:44:20,327;00:44:22,453;I'm not his brother.
444;00:44:22,536;00:44:24,827;He trusts you more than anyone.
445;00:44:25,869;00:44:27,869;Now's the time.
446;00:45:02,952;00:45:04,411;Sam?
447;00:45:04,494;00:45:08,286;I'm sorry, I know I'm not
447;00:45:04,494;00:45:08,286;supposed to be down here.
448;00:45:11,536;00:45:13,910;Were you hiding from me?
448;00:45:11,536;00:45:13,910;Of course not.
449;00:45:15,077;00:45:17,161;What are you doing in Winterfell?
450;00:45:17,244;00:45:19,910;Or did you read every book
450;00:45:17,244;00:45:19,910;in the Citadel already?
451;00:45:23,411;00:45:25,119;What's wrong?
452;00:45:25,202;00:45:26,661;Gilly? Is she all right?
453;00:45:26,744;00:45:28,578;She's good.
453;00:45:26,744;00:45:28,578;Little Sam?
454;00:45:30,703;00:45:31,703;Don't you know?
455;00:45:33,077;00:45:34,202;Know what?
456;00:45:35,619;00:45:36,619;Daenerys...
457;00:45:37,785;00:45:40,952;she executed my father and brother.
458;00:45:41,035;00:45:42,619;They were her prisoners.
459;00:45:46,578;00:45:48,619;She didn't tell you.
460;00:45:56,994;00:45:58,286;I'm so sorry.
461;00:46:01,785;00:46:03,494;We need to end this war.
462;00:46:05,244;00:46:06,827;Would you have done it?
463;00:46:08,910;00:46:10,869;Well, I've executed men
463;00:46:08,910;00:46:10,869;who disobeyed me.
464;00:46:10,952;00:46:12,661;You've also spared men.
465;00:46:12,744;00:46:15,327;Thousands of wildlings
465;00:46:12,744;00:46:15,327;when they refused to kneel.
466;00:46:15,411;00:46:16,869;I wasn't a king.
467;00:46:19,244;00:46:20,286;But you were.
468;00:46:21,994;00:46:23,327;You've always been.
469;00:46:25,286;00:46:26,994;I gave up my crown, Sam.
470;00:46:27,785;00:46:28,785;I bent the knee.
471;00:46:28,869;00:46:30,411;I'm not King in the North anymore.
472;00:46:30,494;00:46:32,137;I'm not talking about
472;00:46:30,494;00:46:32,137;the King in the North.
473;00:46:32,161;00:46:35,411;I'm talking about the King
473;00:46:32,161;00:46:35,411;of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.
474;00:46:42,994;00:46:44,703;Bran and I worked it out.
475;00:46:44,785;00:46:47,619;I had a High Septon's diary.
475;00:46:44,785;00:46:47,619;Bran had...
476;00:46:48,744;00:46:50,077;whatever Bran has.
477;00:46:50,161;00:46:52,119;What are you talking about?
478;00:46:55,244;00:46:56,286;Your mother...
479;00:46:57,453;00:46:58,785;was Lyanna Stark.
480;00:47:00,369;00:47:01,703;And your father...
481;00:47:02,994;00:47:04,952;your real father
482;00:47:05,035;00:47:06,703;was Rhaegar Targaryen.
483;00:47:08,869;00:47:11,494;You've never been a bastard.
484;00:47:11,578;00:47:15,327;You're Aegon Targaryen,
484;00:47:11,578;00:47:15,327;true heir to the Iron Throne.
485;00:47:19,578;00:47:22,369;I'm sorry,
485;00:47:19,578;00:47:22,369;I know it's a lot to take in.
486;00:47:31,578;00:47:34,910;My father was the most
486;00:47:31,578;00:47:34,910;honorable man I ever met.
487;00:47:38,453;00:47:40,536;You're saying
487;00:47:38,453;00:47:40,536;he lied to me all my life.
488;00:47:40,619;00:47:41,744;No.
489;00:47:42,744;00:47:46,244;Your father... Well, Ned Stark.
490;00:47:46,327;00:47:49,703;He promised your mother
490;00:47:46,327;00:47:49,703;he'd always protect you.
491;00:47:49,785;00:47:52,578;And he did. Robert would have
491;00:47:49,785;00:47:52,578;murdered you if he knew.
492;00:47:54,578;00:47:56,077;You're the true king.
493;00:47:57,244;00:47:59,119;Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name,
494;00:47:59,202;00:48:01,202;Protector of the Realm, all of it.
495;00:48:15,744;00:48:18,703;Daenerys is our queen.
495;00:48:15,744;00:48:18,703;She shouldn't be.
496;00:48:20,619;00:48:22,619;That's treason.
496;00:48:20,619;00:48:22,619;It's the truth.
497;00:48:24,369;00:48:26,952;You gave up your crown
497;00:48:24,369;00:48:26,952;to save your people.
498;00:48:28,619;00:48:30,286;Would she do the same?
499;00:50:38,494;00:50:40,161;Stay back, he's got blue eyes!
500;00:50:40,244;00:50:41,869;I've always had blue eyes!
501;00:50:51,910;00:50:53,077;Did you find anyone?
502;00:51:26,453;00:51:28,619;The Umber boy.
503;00:51:28,703;00:51:29,827;It's a message.
504;00:51:30,952;00:51:32,536;From the Night King.
505;00:51:32,619;00:51:36,286;His army's between us
505;00:51:32,619;00:51:36,286;and Winterfell. We're on foot.
506;00:51:36,369;00:51:38,202;We rode down from Castle Black.
507;00:51:38,286;00:51:40,536;We can double up on the horses.
508;00:51:40,619;00:51:44,536;If the horses last,
508;00:51:40,619;00:51:44,536;we'll get there before the dead.
509;00:51:44,619;00:51:45,744;We just have to hope
510;00:51:45,827;00:51:47,536;the Night King doesn't come first.
511;00:52:39,202;00:52:41,744;Keep moving! Straight up!
512;00:52:43,619;00:52:46,536;Stay together!
512;00:52:43,619;00:52:46,536;Don't fall behind!

514;00:55:01,661;00:55:03,494;my brother would tell me

515;00:55:03,578;00:55:07,035;who murdered our father.
516;00:55:08,369;00:55:10,827;About all the things we would

517;00:55:13,494;00:55:15,077;You never should have trusted Cersei.

522;00:55:30,369;00:55:32,369;Before the sun comes up tomorrow.
