124;00:08:13,923;00:08:16,958;with a dead man's bastard?

150;00:09:48,953;00:09:52,189;An important bridge.
150;00:09:48,953;00:09:52,189;Ah.
151;00:09:52,223;00:09:54,392;It was before
151;00:09:52,223;00:09:54,392;they killed my father.
152;00:09:54,426;00:09:58,463;I still thought I could march south

157;00:10:11,377;00:10:14,279;that about their fathers, but--

162;00:10:26,059;00:10:28,361;all of them.

166;00:10:38,472;00:10:40,674;with fear in the morning
167;00:10:40,708;00:10:42,976;and went to bed
167;00:10:40,708;00:10:42,976;with fear in the night.
168;00:10:44,879;00:10:47,781;I didn't believe him.
169;00:10:47,815;00:10:49,983;I asked him,
170;00:10:50,017;00:10:53,252;how can a man be brave
170;00:10:50,017;00:10:53,252;if he's afraid?
171;00:10:53,287;00:10:56,823;That is the only time
171;00:10:53,287;00:10:56,823;a man can be brave, he told me.
172;00:11:00,093;00:11:03,095;I wish I could have
172;00:11:00,093;00:11:03,095;met him.
173;00:11:03,129;00:11:05,497;He would have
173;00:11:03,129;00:11:05,497;liked you.

176;00:11:12,339;00:11:14,529;He didn't care much
176;00:11:12,339;00:11:14,529;about gold or glory.
177;00:11:14,554;00:11:16,074;And you?
178;00:11:16,075;00:11:19,311;You think I'm fighting this war so
178;00:11:16,075;00:11:19,311;they'll sing songs about me?
179;00:11:20,947;00:11:22,614;I want to go home.
180;00:11:22,648;00:11:25,316;I want the men

181;00:11:25,351;00:11:26,884;Then why don't you?
182;00:11:26,919;00:11:30,554;Because we'll never be safe until

250;00:14:46,221;00:14:48,789;Have I ever harmed you?
250;00:14:46,221;00:14:48,789;You've harmed others--
251;00:14:48,823;00:14:51,358;those you were
251;00:14:48,823;00:14:51,358;sworn to protect,
252;00:14:51,392;00:14:53,427;the weak,
252;00:14:51,392;00:14:53,427;the innocent.
253;00:14:53,461;00:14:56,630;Has anyone ever told you you're
253;00:14:53,461;00:14:56,630;as boring as you are ugly?
254;00:14:56,664;00:14:59,166;You will not
254;00:14:56,664;00:14:59,166;provoke me to anger.
255;00:14:59,200;00:15:01,702;I already have.
255;00:14:59,200;00:15:01,702;Look at you.
256;00:15:01,736;00:15:03,503;You're ready
256;00:15:01,736;00:15:03,503;to chop my head off.
257;00:15:03,538;00:15:06,306;Do you think
257;00:15:03,538;00:15:06,306;you could?
258;00:15:06,341;00:15:08,341;Do you think you could
258;00:15:06,341;00:15:08,341;beat me in a fair fight?
259;00:15:08,376;00:15:10,076;I've never
259;00:15:08,376;00:15:10,076;seen you fight.
260;00:15:10,110;00:15:12,112;The answer is no.
261;00:15:12,146;00:15:14,458;There are three men
261;00:15:12,146;00:15:14,458;in the kingdoms who might
262;00:15:14,483;00:15:15,648;have a chance against me.
263;00:15:15,649;00:15:17,150;You're not one of them.
264;00:15:17,185;00:15:20,287;All my life men like you
264;00:15:17,185;00:15:20,287;have sneered at me.
265;00:15:20,321;00:15:23,557;And all my life I've been knocking
265;00:15:20,321;00:15:23,557;men like you into the dust.
266;00:15:23,591;00:15:26,026;If you're so confident,
266;00:15:23,591;00:15:26,026;unlock my chains.
267;00:15:26,060;00:15:27,795;Let's see what happens.
268;00:15:27,830;00:15:30,898;Do you take me
268;00:15:27,830;00:15:30,898;for an idiot? In.
269;00:15:33,169;00:15:36,037;I took you
269;00:15:33,169;00:15:36,037;for a fighter,
270;00:15:36,072;00:15:39,974;a man-- pardon--
270;00:15:36,072;00:15:39,974;woman of honor.
271;00:15:40,009;00:15:42,477;Was I wrong?
272;00:15:42,511;00:15:44,245;You're afraid.
273;00:15:45,814;00:15:49,284;Maybe one day
273;00:15:45,814;00:15:49,284;we'll find out, Kingslayer.
274;00:16:02,430;00:16:04,464;Kevan: King's Landing
274;00:16:02,430;00:16:04,464;will fall an hour
275;00:16:04,499;00:16:07,601;after Stannis
275;00:16:04,499;00:16:07,601;lands his force.
276;00:16:07,635;00:16:09,936;It's not too late for
276;00:16:07,635;00:16:09,936;King Joffrey and Cersei
277;00:16:09,971;00:16:13,306;and the court
277;00:16:09,971;00:16:13,306;to ride west to safety.
278;00:16:13,341;00:16:15,442;Surrender the Iron Throne?
279;00:16:15,476;00:16:18,479;Better than seeing their heads
279;00:16:15,476;00:16:18,479;mounted on the city gates.
280;00:16:18,513;00:16:21,114;Stannis will
280;00:16:18,513;00:16:21,114;execute them all.
281;00:16:21,149;00:16:24,284;No, a king who runs
281;00:16:21,149;00:16:24,284;will not be king for long.
282;00:16:24,319;00:16:27,087;He's a Lannister.
282;00:16:24,319;00:16:27,087;He'll stand and fight.
283;00:16:28,689;00:16:31,190;Stannis, two days
283;00:16:28,689;00:16:31,190;from the capital
284;00:16:31,224;00:16:32,958;and the wolf
284;00:16:31,224;00:16:32,958;at my doorstep.
285;00:16:32,993;00:16:36,028;The scouts assure us Robb Stark
285;00:16:32,993;00:16:36,028;remains north of Ashemark.
286;00:16:36,062;00:16:38,930;Ha! The last time
286;00:16:36,062;00:16:38,930;the scouts assured us
287;00:16:38,964;00:16:41,666;of Stark's movement,
287;00:16:38,964;00:16:41,666;he lured us into a trap.
288;00:16:43,168;00:16:45,937;Which is why my son
288;00:16:43,168;00:16:45,937;is his prisoner.
289;00:16:49,443;00:16:51,711;Too close
289;00:16:49,443;00:16:51,711;to Casterly Rock.
290;00:16:53,080;00:16:55,282;He sent a splinter force
291;00:16:55,316;00:16:56,917;to recapture Winterfell.
292;00:16:56,951;00:16:59,153;The Greyjoys have
292;00:16:56,951;00:16:59,153;done us a great favor.
293;00:16:59,187;00:17:02,390;Stark won't risk marching
293;00:16:59,187;00:17:02,390;on Casterly Rock
294;00:17:02,424;00:17:03,991;until he's at full force.
295;00:17:04,025;00:17:07,728;He's a boy and he's
295;00:17:04,025;00:17:07,728;never lost a battle.
296;00:17:07,762;00:17:10,063;He'll risk anything
296;00:17:07,762;00:17:10,063;at any time
297;00:17:10,097;00:17:13,733;because he doesn't know
297;00:17:10,097;00:17:13,733;enough to be afraid.
298;00:17:21,140;00:17:23,141;We'll ride at nightfall.
299;00:17:23,175;00:17:26,411;I want a full night's march before
299;00:17:23,175;00:17:26,411;he knows we're on the move.
300;00:17:26,445;00:17:29,981;Clegane, you'll maintain
300;00:17:26,445;00:17:29,981;a garrison here at Harrenhal.
301;00:17:30,015;00:17:33,518;Track down this brotherhood
301;00:17:30,015;00:17:33,518;and destroy them.
302;00:17:35,787;00:17:38,589;The girl has proven
302;00:17:35,787;00:17:38,589;herself a good servant.
303;00:17:38,624;00:17:41,025;She'll stay on with you.
304;00:17:41,060;00:17:43,294;See that he doesn't get
304;00:17:41,060;00:17:43,294;drunk in the evenings.
305;00:17:43,329;00:17:46,097;He's poor company
305;00:17:43,329;00:17:46,097;when he's sober,
306;00:17:46,131;00:17:48,800;but he's better
306;00:17:46,131;00:17:48,800;at his work.
307;00:17:55,473;00:17:58,175;You've got some
307;00:17:55,473;00:17:58,175;questions to answer.
308;00:17:58,209;00:18:00,243;Man:
308;00:17:58,209;00:18:00,243;Who killed Ser Amory?
309;00:18:00,278;00:18:01,945;Man #2: I don't know!
309;00:18:00,278;00:18:01,945;Give me the name.
310;00:18:01,979;00:18:04,280;Man #2: Please!
310;00:18:01,979;00:18:04,280;Man #3: Take this one out for the crows.
311;00:18:04,315;00:18:07,651;Man #2:
311;00:18:04,315;00:18:07,651;I told you, I don't know.
312;00:18:07,686;00:18:09,787;Please.
313;00:18:09,821;00:18:12,556;Look, it's Yoren's
313;00:18:09,821;00:18:12,556;little cunt.
314;00:18:12,591;00:18:14,325;Used to be a boy,
314;00:18:12,591;00:18:14,325;now it's a girl.

316;00:18:17,296;00:18:18,931;Don't care.
317;00:18:18,965;00:18:22,067;Where's your stick
317;00:18:18,965;00:18:22,067;now, bitch?
318;00:18:22,101;00:18:23,568;I promised
318;00:18:22,101;00:18:23,568;to fuck you with it.
319;00:18:23,603;00:18:26,671;Guard: Come on, time to kill
319;00:18:23,603;00:18:26,671;some wolves.
320;00:18:26,706;00:18:29,874;( Men shouting )
321;00:18:35,581;00:18:37,815;You need sour cherries
321;00:18:35,581;00:18:37,815;to make it right.
322;00:18:37,849;00:18:39,966;And the secret is you dry
322;00:18:37,849;00:18:39,966;the stones, and then you
323;00:18:39,991;00:18:41,051;break them with a mallet.
324;00:18:41,052;00:18:42,853;That's where
324;00:18:41,052;00:18:42,853;the real flavor is.
325;00:18:42,887;00:18:44,521;You crush 'em up real fine.
326;00:18:44,556;00:18:46,758;And then when you're finished,
326;00:18:44,556;00:18:46,758;you sprinkle them over the piecrust.
327;00:18:46,792;00:18:48,627;Where's Jaqen?
327;00:18:46,792;00:18:48,627;How would I know?
328;00:18:48,661;00:18:50,462;I need him now.
329;00:18:50,497;00:18:52,197;Lord Tywin's

331;00:18:54,968;00:18:57,436;Where?
332;00:18:59,906;00:19:01,440;Where?!
332;00:18:59,906;00:19:01,440;Ow!
333;00:19:01,475;00:19:02,238;Where?
334;00:19:02,263;00:19:03,910;They went riding out
334;00:19:02,263;00:19:03,910;the gates a few hours ago.
335;00:19:03,911;00:19:08,047;On patrol.
335;00:19:03,911;00:19:08,047;Let go of my ears.

342;00:19:34,943;00:19:36,744;will be worth 1,000
342;00:19:34,943;00:19:36,744;fighting against it.
343;00:19:36,778;00:19:38,947;They'll never trust me.

344;00:19:38,981;00:19:40,916;If you do what needs to be done.
344;00:19:38,981;00:19:40,916;What?
345;00:19:40,950;00:19:43,486;How does it feel knowing

346;00:19:43,520;00:19:46,573;so you could skip through the

347;00:19:46,574;00:19:47,175;I didn't.
348;00:19:47,200;00:19:50,280;I should have known better,
348;00:19:47,200;00:19:50,280;trusting a traitor's bastard.
349;00:19:54,264;00:19:57,800;He's not yours
349;00:19:54,264;00:19:57,800;to kill, crow.
350;00:20:20,325;00:20:21,959;Do you have
350;00:20:20,325;00:20:21,959;to do that here?
351;00:20:23,561;00:20:26,630;I like to keep
351;00:20:23,561;00:20:26,630;me hands clean.

352;00:20:26,664;00:20:29,266;have to do it here?
353;00:20:38,476;00:20:40,076;You should start wearing
353;00:20:38,476;00:20:40,076;the gold cloak.
354;00:20:40,111;00:20:41,745;I don't want to wear
354;00:20:40,111;00:20:41,745;a gold cloak.

360;00:20:51,188;00:20:53,323;so you're nice and easy
360;00:20:51,188;00:20:53,323;to spot at night.
361;00:20:53,357;00:20:56,193;Well, you're not sneaking
361;00:20:53,357;00:20:56,193;through alleyways any longer.
362;00:20:56,227;00:20:58,094;You're supposed
362;00:20:56,227;00:20:58,094;to stand out.
363;00:20:58,129;00:21:01,231;We had a deal, and wearing

387;00:22:11,742;00:22:14,176;Me and the lads rounded up

393;00:22:27,923;00:22:30,358;Maybe this part's
393;00:22:27,923;00:22:30,358;not in your books.
394;00:22:30,393;00:22:32,794;See, it's not the fighting
394;00:22:30,393;00:22:32,794;that kills most people.
395;00:22:32,828;00:22:36,031;It's the starving.
395;00:22:32,828;00:22:36,031;Food's worth more than gold.
396;00:22:36,065;00:22:39,668;Noble ladies sell their diamonds

410;00:23:20,942;00:23:24,678;and he knows which gates
410;00:23:20,942;00:23:24,678;are weakest.

413;00:23:32,187;00:23:34,888;and it's only 50 yards
413;00:23:32,187;00:23:34,888;from the water.
414;00:23:34,923;00:23:36,457;That's where he'll land.

415;00:23:36,491;00:23:39,360;attack the mud gate,

417;00:23:41,696;00:23:43,697;We could throw

488;00:28:01,352;00:28:03,486;I'll un-name you.
489;00:28:03,521;00:28:04,519;Thank you.
490;00:28:04,544;00:28:06,273;If you help me
490;00:28:04,544;00:28:06,273;and my friends escape.
491;00:28:08,092;00:28:09,893;This would require
491;00:28:08,092;00:28:09,893;more than one life.
492;00:28:09,927;00:28:13,130;This is not part of our bargain.
492;00:28:09,927;00:28:13,130;Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.
493;00:28:13,164;00:28:15,266;A girl lacks honor.
494;00:28:23,175;00:28:26,110;If I do this thing,
494;00:28:23,175;00:28:26,110;a girl must obey.
495;00:28:26,145;00:28:28,213;A girl will obey.
496;00:28:29,815;00:28:33,117;A girl and her friends will walk
496;00:28:29,815;00:28:33,117;through the gate at midnight.
497;00:28:38,222;00:28:40,356;Thank you, Podrick.
498;00:28:46,765;00:28:48,632;Odd little boy.
499;00:28:48,666;00:28:50,867;I have a certain sympathy
499;00:28:48,666;00:28:50,867;for odd little boys.
500;00:28:50,902;00:28:53,470;You and Varys both.
501;00:28:55,106;00:28:57,341;Excellent lamprey pie.
502;00:28:57,376;00:29:00,077;Were you slaving away
502;00:28:57,376;00:29:00,077;in the kitchen all day?
503;00:29:01,179;00:29:02,847;I hear Joffrey
503;00:29:01,179;00:29:02,847;plans on fighting.
504;00:29:02,882;00:29:05,350;An inspiration
504;00:29:02,882;00:29:05,350;for the troops.
505;00:29:05,384;00:29:07,019;The young king
505;00:29:05,384;00:29:07,019;in his shining armor
506;00:29:07,053;00:29:09,854;fighting to defend the capital
506;00:29:07,053;00:29:09,854;against the wicked old rebel.
507;00:29:09,889;00:29:11,690;He's only a boy.
508;00:29:11,724;00:29:14,259;Younger boys are off
508;00:29:11,724;00:29:14,259;fighting his war.
509;00:29:14,294;00:29:16,095;He's not ready.
510;00:29:16,129;00:29:18,364;What is he, 17?
511;00:29:18,399;00:29:21,200;Remember Jaime at 17?
511;00:29:18,399;00:29:21,200;Better than you.
512;00:29:21,235;00:29:24,037;Some men have a gift
512;00:29:21,235;00:29:24,037;for this sort of thing,
513;00:29:24,071;00:29:25,939;some don't.
514;00:29:25,973;00:29:27,840;His place is not
514;00:29:25,973;00:29:27,840;on the battlefield.
515;00:29:27,875;00:29:30,109;It's not on
515;00:29:27,875;00:29:30,109;the throne, either,
516;00:29:30,143;00:29:32,577;sadly for all of us.
517;00:29:35,481;00:29:37,816;Do you think
517;00:29:35,481;00:29:37,816;I'm an idiot?
518;00:29:37,850;00:29:39,651;No, I'd say you possess
518;00:29:37,850;00:29:39,651;above average intelligence.
519;00:29:39,686;00:29:41,820;You shipped off
519;00:29:39,686;00:29:41,820;my only daughter.
520;00:29:41,854;00:29:45,156;And now you want to send my
520;00:29:41,854;00:29:45,156;eldest son to the battlefield to die.
521;00:29:45,191;00:29:47,359;He'll have his Kingsguard
521;00:29:45,191;00:29:47,359;protecting him.
522;00:29:47,393;00:29:50,328;He has the finest armor
522;00:29:47,393;00:29:50,328;gold can buy.
523;00:29:50,363;00:29:52,230;He needs to be out there.
524;00:29:52,265;00:29:54,345;The men will fight more
524;00:29:52,265;00:29:54,345;fiercely seeing their king
525;00:29:54,370;00:29:55,300;fighting beside them
526;00:29:55,301;00:29:58,971;instead of hiding behind
526;00:29:55,301;00:29:58,971;his mother's skirts.
527;00:29:59,005;00:30:01,440;Any dessert?
528;00:30:01,474;00:30:04,377;Do you know why
528;00:30:01,474;00:30:04,377;Varys is so dangerous?
529;00:30:04,411;00:30:07,447;Because he has thousands
529;00:30:04,411;00:30:07,447;of spies in his employ.
530;00:30:07,481;00:30:10,784;Because he knows everything
530;00:30:07,481;00:30:10,784;we do before we do it.
531;00:30:10,818;00:30:12,386;Because he doesn't
531;00:30:10,818;00:30:12,386;have a cock.
532;00:30:12,420;00:30:14,855;Neither do you.
533;00:30:16,158;00:30:18,659;Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.
534;00:30:18,693;00:30:20,494;You, on the other hand,
535;00:30:20,529;00:30:22,997;are as big a fool
535;00:30:20,529;00:30:22,997;as every other man.
536;00:30:23,032;00:30:25,366;That little worm
536;00:30:23,032;00:30:25,366;between your legs
537;00:30:25,401;00:30:26,901;does half your thinking.
538;00:30:26,935;00:30:29,803;It's not that little.
538;00:30:26,935;00:30:29,803;( Laughs )
539;00:30:35,276;00:30:36,843;Why are you smiling?
540;00:30:36,877;00:30:39,412;Because I'm happy.
541;00:30:39,446;00:30:41,180;And why are you happy?
542;00:30:44,818;00:30:47,888;Because I have
542;00:30:44,818;00:30:47,888;your little whore.
543;00:30:50,625;00:30:53,094;I thought you
543;00:30:50,625;00:30:53,094;preferred blondes.
544;00:30:53,128;00:30:54,495;Such a droll little fellow.
545;00:30:54,530;00:30:56,364;Tell me, have you
545;00:30:54,530;00:30:56,364;married this one yet?
546;00:30:56,399;00:30:58,633;No?
547;00:30:58,668;00:31:01,604;Oh, good.
547;00:30:58,668;00:31:01,604;Father will be so pleased.
548;00:31:01,638;00:31:03,273;Why do you care
548;00:31:01,638;00:31:03,273;who I fuck?
549;00:31:03,307;00:31:05,975;Because a Lannister
549;00:31:03,307;00:31:05,975;always pays her debts.
550;00:31:06,010;00:31:07,610;You stole my only daughter,
551;00:31:07,645;00:31:09,245;you plot to have
551;00:31:07,645;00:31:09,245;Joffrey killed.
552;00:31:09,279;00:31:12,182;This is madness.
552;00:31:09,279;00:31:12,182;Stannis will be here in days.
553;00:31:12,216;00:31:13,783;You need me.
553;00:31:12,216;00:31:13,783;For what?
554;00:31:13,818;00:31:15,919;Your skill in battle?
555;00:31:17,555;00:31:19,889;Pretty thing, your whore.
556;00:31:19,923;00:31:22,425;Lovely body.
557;00:31:22,460;00:31:25,028;The bruises
557;00:31:22,460;00:31:25,028;will heal in time.
558;00:31:26,464;00:31:28,131;Where did you find her?
559;00:31:28,166;00:31:30,401;Varys isn't the only one
559;00:31:28,166;00:31:30,401;who hears whispers.
560;00:31:30,435;00:31:33,904;Really, a Lannister
560;00:31:30,435;00:31:33,904;lion necklace?
561;00:31:33,939;00:31:37,041;You need to hide your secret whores
561;00:31:33,939;00:31:37,041;more carefully.
562;00:31:37,076;00:31:39,911;You've forgotten the most
562;00:31:37,076;00:31:39,911;important thing about whores.
563;00:31:39,945;00:31:41,780;Oh?
564;00:31:41,814;00:31:43,415;Well, you're the expert.
565;00:31:43,449;00:31:45,617;Tell me.
566;00:31:45,652;00:31:49,120;"You don't buy them;"
566;00:31:45,652;00:31:49,120;You only rent them.
567;00:31:50,423;00:31:53,691;You're usually a better liar,
567;00:31:50,423;00:31:53,691;baby brother.
568;00:31:53,725;00:31:55,659;This one you like.
569;00:31:56,761;00:31:59,196;You like her very much.
570;00:31:59,230;00:32:01,298;Could it be love?
571;00:32:01,332;00:32:04,935;Don't worry, she'll be treated
571;00:32:01,332;00:32:04,935;gently enough...
572;00:32:05,003;00:32:06,670;unless Joffrey is hurt.
573;00:32:06,704;00:32:10,274;And then every wound
573;00:32:06,704;00:32:10,274;he suffers she'll suffer, too.
574;00:32:10,309;00:32:12,677;And if he dies,
575;00:32:12,711;00:32:14,678;there isn't a man alive
575;00:32:12,711;00:32:14,678;who could devise
576;00:32:14,713;00:32:17,882;a more painful death
576;00:32:14,713;00:32:17,882;for your little cunt.
577;00:32:20,453;00:32:24,156;And how do I know you
577;00:32:20,453;00:32:24,156;haven't killed her already?
578;00:32:24,190;00:32:25,691;Would you like to see her?
579;00:32:25,725;00:32:27,326;I thought you might.
580;00:32:27,360;00:32:30,096;Ser Mandon, bring in
580;00:32:27,360;00:32:30,096;my brother's whore.
581;00:33:02,529;00:33:04,630;I'm sorry they hurt you.
582;00:33:06,033;00:33:08,534;You must be brave.
583;00:33:13,005;00:33:15,807;I promise
583;00:33:13,005;00:33:15,807;I will free you.
584;00:33:17,442;00:33:18,942;Don't forget me.
585;00:33:18,977;00:33:21,278;Never.
586;00:33:28,687;00:33:32,123;( Door opens, closes )
587;00:33:39,066;00:33:41,767;I will hurt you
587;00:33:39,066;00:33:41,767;for this.
588;00:33:41,802;00:33:45,405;A day will come when you
588;00:33:41,802;00:33:45,405;think you're safe and happy
589;00:33:45,439;00:33:49,542;and your joy will turn
589;00:33:45,439;00:33:49,542;to ashes in your mouth.
590;00:33:50,611;00:33:52,245;And you will know
590;00:33:50,611;00:33:52,245;the debt is paid.
591;00:33:52,279;00:33:55,415;Get out.
592;00:34:06,793;00:34:08,894;Shae!
593;00:34:11,298;00:34:13,598;I've been waiting
593;00:34:11,298;00:34:13,598;all night.
594;00:34:13,633;00:34:15,333;What is wrong?
595;00:34:15,368;00:34:17,502;You're beautiful.
596;00:34:25,511;00:34:27,846;Then why do you look sad?
597;00:34:34,288;00:34:36,188;We have to be
597;00:34:34,288;00:34:36,188;more careful.
598;00:34:36,223;00:34:39,258;Don't be afraid.
598;00:34:36,223;00:34:39,258;I can take care of myself.
599;00:34:39,292;00:34:42,361;There are people
599;00:34:39,292;00:34:42,361;who want to hurt me.
600;00:34:42,396;00:34:44,864;I know.
600;00:34:42,396;00:34:44,864;I won't let them.
601;00:34:44,898;00:34:48,067;I'll cut off their faces.
601;00:34:44,898;00:34:48,067;I will.
602;00:34:52,139;00:34:56,008;I would kill for you.
602;00:34:52,139;00:34:56,008;Do you know that?
603;00:34:56,042;00:34:59,778;I expect I'll have to
603;00:34:56,042;00:34:59,778;before this is over.
604;00:35:02,282;00:35:04,083;You're mine.
605;00:35:05,452;00:35:07,253;I'm yours.
606;00:35:07,287;00:35:09,622;Promise me.

607;00:35:13,293;00:35:16,796;and you are mine.

611;00:35:34,947;00:35:38,316;a few days from Winterfell.
612;00:35:38,350;00:35:40,351;Once he captures the castle--

613;00:35:40,385;00:35:44,755;He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.

619;00:36:02,442;00:36:06,111;of Theon Greyjoy.
620;00:36:06,146;00:36:09,347;He betrayed our cause.
621;00:36:09,382;00:36:11,650;He betrayed me.
622;00:36:11,684;00:36:14,620;And we will hunt him down
622;00:36:11,684;00:36:14,620;no matter where he runs.
623;00:36:14,654;00:36:17,071;I expect his countrymen
623;00:36:14,654;00:36:17,071;will turn on him the minute
624;00:36:17,096;00:36:18,301;they hear the offer.
625;00:36:21,094;00:36:23,995;Your pardon, My Lord.
625;00:36:21,094;00:36:23,995;Your Grace.
626;00:36:24,030;00:36:25,964;My Lady.

628;00:36:40,343;00:36:42,011;How am I?
629;00:36:42,045;00:36:44,279;I've had to arrest
629;00:36:42,045;00:36:44,279;my mother.

632;00:36:48,685;00:36:51,521;has seized my home
632;00:36:48,685;00:36:51,521;and my brothers.
633;00:36:51,555;00:36:54,657;I'm fighting a war and I don't know
633;00:36:51,555;00:36:54,657;if I should march south or north.
634;00:36:54,691;00:36:57,159;I'm sorry.
634;00:36:54,691;00:36:57,159;It was a stupid question.
635;00:36:57,194;00:36:59,462;I'm sorry.
635;00:36:57,194;00:36:59,462;No.
636;00:36:59,496;00:37:01,731;Forgive me.
637;00:37:01,765;00:37:04,066;You're being kind.
637;00:37:01,765;00:37:04,066;I have no right.
638;00:37:04,101;00:37:06,135;You have every right.
639;00:37:06,169;00:37:07,537;You're a king.
640;00:37:07,571;00:37:10,039;That's not the kind
640;00:37:07,571;00:37:10,039;of king I want to be.
641;00:37:10,074;00:37:12,342;What kind do you
641;00:37:10,074;00:37:12,342;want to be?
642;00:37:12,376;00:37:15,078;I don't know.
642;00:37:12,376;00:37:15,078;The good kind.
643;00:37:17,948;00:37:20,584;Most kings grew up
643;00:37:17,948;00:37:20,584;as princes.
644;00:37:20,618;00:37:23,787;They spend their whole lives
644;00:37:20,618;00:37:23,787;preparing for the crown.
645;00:37:23,821;00:37:26,823;I was raised to be

646;00:37:28,393;00:37:31,027;I was raised to be
646;00:37:28,393;00:37:31,027;a proper little lady,
647;00:37:31,062;00:37:34,130;to play the harp
647;00:37:31,062;00:37:34,130;and dance the latest steps
648;00:37:34,164;00:37:36,199;and recite
648;00:37:34,164;00:37:36,199;Valyrian poetry.
649;00:37:36,233;00:37:37,834;I'd like to hear you
649;00:37:36,233;00:37:37,834;play the harp.
650;00:37:37,868;00:37:40,003;No.
650;00:37:37,868;00:37:40,003;No, you would not.

652;00:37:45,042;00:37:48,878;How did you go from
652;00:37:45,042;00:37:48,878;reciting Valyrian poetry
653;00:37:48,912;00:37:51,113;to sawing off
653;00:37:48,912;00:37:51,113;men's feet?
654;00:38:01,190;00:38:03,224;When I was 12,
655;00:38:03,258;00:38:05,860;my mother and father
655;00:38:03,258;00:38:05,860;went to a wedding.
656;00:38:05,894;00:38:09,163;Weddings in Volantis
656;00:38:05,894;00:38:09,163;last for days, you know.
657;00:38:09,198;00:38:11,433;And they left me
657;00:38:09,198;00:38:11,433;with my little brother.
658;00:38:13,102;00:38:15,037;The second afternoon
658;00:38:13,102;00:38:15,037;they were gone
659;00:38:15,071;00:38:18,107;was the hottest day
659;00:38:15,071;00:38:18,107;in the three-year summer.
660;00:38:18,141;00:38:21,678;We couldn't bear to be inside,
660;00:38:18,141;00:38:21,678;so we ran down to the Rhoyne.
661;00:38:21,712;00:38:25,315;Every child in Volantis
661;00:38:21,712;00:38:25,315;was in the Rhoyne that day.
662;00:38:27,118;00:38:29,385;The rich, the poor,
662;00:38:27,118;00:38:29,385;we were all there,
663;00:38:29,419;00:38:32,588;naked, screaming, racing
663;00:38:29,419;00:38:32,588;to the little islands.
664;00:38:32,622;00:38:35,458;Drummers were playing
664;00:38:32,622;00:38:35,458;for coppers on the east bank.
665;00:38:39,696;00:38:42,098;I was treading water,
666;00:38:42,132;00:38:44,433;talking to a friend
667;00:38:44,467;00:38:46,935;when I realized
667;00:38:44,467;00:38:46,935;I hadn't seen my brother.
668;00:38:48,538;00:38:51,273;I called his name.
669;00:38:51,307;00:38:53,976;Then I started
669;00:38:51,307;00:38:53,976;screaming his name.
670;00:38:55,945;00:38:58,646;And then I saw him
671;00:38:58,680;00:39:00,781;floating facedown.
672;00:39:02,383;00:39:05,219;My heart just...
672;00:39:02,383;00:39:05,219;stopped.
673;00:39:05,253;00:39:07,354;I was...
674;00:39:10,625;00:39:13,293;I dragged him
674;00:39:10,625;00:39:13,293;from the water.
675;00:39:13,328;00:39:15,863;My friend helped me,
675;00:39:13,328;00:39:15,863;I think.
676;00:39:15,897;00:39:17,965;I don't even remember.
677;00:39:20,735;00:39:22,503;He was so little.
678;00:39:23,805;00:39:26,206;Then we pulled him
678;00:39:23,805;00:39:26,206;onto the riverbank...
679;00:39:28,243;00:39:30,377;and I screamed at him
680;00:39:30,412;00:39:32,880;and I shook him
681;00:39:32,914;00:39:35,216;and he was dead.
682;00:39:36,384;00:39:38,118;Just dead.
683;00:39:41,856;00:39:44,191;A man ran over.
684;00:39:45,927;00:39:49,163;He had a fish
684;00:39:45,927;00:39:49,163;tattoo on his face.
685;00:39:50,465;00:39:52,834;In Volantis the slaves
685;00:39:50,465;00:39:52,834;have tattoos
686;00:39:52,868;00:39:56,204;so you know what they are
686;00:39:52,868;00:39:56,204;without having to talk to them.
687;00:39:56,238;00:39:58,940;And this man worked
687;00:39:56,238;00:39:58,940;on a fishing boat.
688;00:39:58,974;00:40:02,310;And he pushed me
688;00:39:58,974;00:40:02,310;out of the way.
689;00:40:02,344;00:40:04,312;You have to understand,
690;00:40:04,346;00:40:07,515;for a slave to push
690;00:40:04,346;00:40:07,515;a highborn girl--
691;00:40:07,549;00:40:11,385;that's death for the man,
691;00:40:07,549;00:40:11,385;a terrible death.
692;00:40:11,420;00:40:15,322;But he pushed me
692;00:40:11,420;00:40:15,322;out of the way
693;00:40:15,356;00:40:19,525;and he started pressing
693;00:40:15,356;00:40:19,525;on my brother's chest
694;00:40:19,560;00:40:24,096;again and again
694;00:40:19,560;00:40:24,096;and again
695;00:40:24,131;00:40:27,367;until my brother
695;00:40:24,131;00:40:27,367;spat out
696;00:40:27,401;00:40:29,903;half of the Rhoyne
697;00:40:29,937;00:40:31,338;and cried out.
698;00:40:31,372;00:40:34,741;And the man cradled his head
698;00:40:31,372;00:40:34,741;and told him to be calm.
699;00:40:41,249;00:40:43,918;I decided
699;00:40:41,249;00:40:43,918;two things that day.
700;00:40:43,952;00:40:45,653;I would not
700;00:40:43,952;00:40:45,653;waste my years
701;00:40:45,687;00:40:49,858;planning dances and masquerades
701;00:40:45,687;00:40:49,858;with the other noble ladies.
702;00:40:49,892;00:40:53,328;And when
702;00:40:49,892;00:40:53,328;I came of age...
703;00:40:54,530;00:40:57,065;I would never live
703;00:40:54,530;00:40:57,065;in a slave city again.

705;00:41:06,074;00:41:09,310;You told me of your problems
705;00:41:06,074;00:41:09,310;and I've blathered on.
706;00:41:09,345;00:41:11,746;I don't want to marry
706;00:41:09,345;00:41:11,746;the Frey girl.
707;00:41:15,685;00:41:17,420;I don't want you
707;00:41:15,685;00:41:17,420;to marry her.
708;00:41:20,991;00:41:23,359;But you needed
708;00:41:20,991;00:41:23,359;that bridge.
709;00:41:25,796;00:41:28,331;I hope it's a very
709;00:41:25,796;00:41:28,331;beautiful bridge.

716;00:42:45,743;00:42:47,645;could be better.
717;00:42:47,679;00:42:49,313;I did get some

740;00:44:22,978;00:44:25,446;fly the onion flag.
741;00:44:25,481;00:44:27,682;My son wishes me
741;00:44:25,481;00:44:27,682;to change it.
742;00:44:27,716;00:44:30,918;Three mermen with tridents,
742;00:44:27,716;00:44:30,918;something like that.
743;00:44:30,952;00:44:34,755;I understand why the older
743;00:44:30,952;00:44:34,755;families look down at me.
744;00:44:34,789;00:44:37,023;Do you?
744;00:44:34,789;00:44:37,023;Why?
745;00:44:37,058;00:44:40,059;My father was a crabber.
745;00:44:37,058;00:44:40,059;And?
746;00:44:40,094;00:44:43,663;Well, sons of Lords don't like to
746;00:44:40,094;00:44:43,663;break bread with sons of crabbers.
747;00:44:43,697;00:44:45,598;Our hands stink.
748;00:44:45,633;00:44:48,201;And where were those Lords
748;00:44:45,633;00:44:48,201;when Storm's End starved?
749;00:44:48,235;00:44:50,537;Many fought bravely
749;00:44:48,235;00:44:50,537;for your brother.
750;00:44:50,571;00:44:53,072;Many fought
750;00:44:50,571;00:44:53,072;for the Mad King.
751;00:44:53,106;00:44:57,077;You defend these men
751;00:44:53,106;00:44:57,077;who insult you behind your back.
752;00:44:57,112;00:44:59,413;Some are happy
752;00:44:57,112;00:44:59,413;to do it to my face.
753;00:44:59,448;00:45:01,683;We were forgotten.
754;00:45:01,717;00:45:04,352;Robert and Ned Stark--
754;00:45:01,717;00:45:04,352;they were the heroes,
755;00:45:04,387;00:45:08,089;the glorious rebels marching
755;00:45:04,387;00:45:08,089;from battle to battle,
756;00:45:08,124;00:45:10,725;liberating towns from
756;00:45:08,124;00:45:10,725;the yoke of the Mad King
757;00:45:10,759;00:45:13,427;while I held Storm's End
757;00:45:10,759;00:45:13,427;with 500 men.
758;00:45:13,461;00:45:15,395;No one has forgotten, Your Grace.
758;00:45:13,461;00:45:15,395;No? Robert did.
759;00:45:15,430;00:45:17,530;He gave Storm's End
759;00:45:15,430;00:45:17,530;to Renly after the war.
760;00:45:17,565;00:45:19,098;Renly never fought
760;00:45:17,565;00:45:19,098;a day in his life.
761;00:45:19,133;00:45:22,168;He was only a boy.
761;00:45:19,133;00:45:22,168;Then why'd he give him Storm's End?
762;00:45:25,772;00:45:27,673;First we ate the horses.
763;00:45:27,707;00:45:31,044;We weren't riding anyway,
763;00:45:27,707;00:45:31,044;not with the castle surrounded.
764;00:45:31,078;00:45:33,747;We couldn't feed them,
764;00:45:31,078;00:45:33,747;so fine, the horses.
765;00:45:33,781;00:45:35,782;Then the cats.
765;00:45:33,781;00:45:35,782;Never liked cats.
766;00:45:35,816;00:45:38,553;So fine.
766;00:45:35,816;00:45:38,553;I do like dogs.
767;00:45:38,587;00:45:40,221;Good animals.
767;00:45:38,587;00:45:40,221;Loyal.
768;00:45:40,256;00:45:42,691;But we ate them.
768;00:45:40,256;00:45:42,691;Then the rats.
769;00:45:42,725;00:45:44,927;The night before
769;00:45:42,725;00:45:44,927;you slipped through,
770;00:45:44,961;00:45:46,829;I thought my wife
770;00:45:44,961;00:45:46,829;was dying.
771;00:45:46,863;00:45:49,097;She couldn't speak anymore,
771;00:45:46,863;00:45:49,097;she was so frail.
772;00:45:49,132;00:45:52,301;And then you made it
772;00:45:49,132;00:45:52,301;through the lines.
773;00:45:52,335;00:45:55,671;Slipped right through in your little
773;00:45:52,335;00:45:55,671;black sailboat with your onions.
774;00:45:55,705;00:45:58,473;And potatoes.
774;00:45:55,705;00:45:58,473;Some salted beef, I believe.
775;00:45:58,508;00:46:01,243;Every man in Storm's End
775;00:45:58,508;00:46:01,243;wanted to kiss you that night.
776;00:46:01,277;00:46:03,612;I was relieved
776;00:46:01,277;00:46:03,612;they did not.
777;00:46:05,349;00:46:08,784;Robert told me to hold
777;00:46:05,349;00:46:08,784;Storm's End, so I held it.
778;00:46:10,187;00:46:12,288;Then he told me
778;00:46:10,187;00:46:12,288;he was giving it to Renly,
779;00:46:12,323;00:46:13,623;so I gave it up.
780;00:46:13,657;00:46:16,059;Insult or no,
780;00:46:13,657;00:46:16,059;I gave it up
781;00:46:16,093;00:46:18,361;because Robert was my older brother
781;00:46:16,093;00:46:18,361;and he was the king
782;00:46:18,396;00:46:20,564;and I've always
782;00:46:18,396;00:46:20,564;done my duty.
783;00:46:20,598;00:46:24,534;But now I'm the rightful king by
783;00:46:20,598;00:46:24,534;every law of Westeros.
784;00:46:24,569;00:46:27,137;And when I sit the Iron Throne,
784;00:46:24,569;00:46:27,137;you'll be my Hand.
785;00:46:29,975;00:46:31,976;Your Grace...
786;00:46:33,812;00:46:35,847;I pray I serve you well.
787;00:46:37,416;00:46:40,084;I expect you'll be the first crabber's
787;00:46:37,416;00:46:40,084;son to wear the badge.
788;00:46:44,790;00:46:46,591;You're the master
788;00:46:44,790;00:46:46,591;of whisperers.
789;00:46:46,625;00:46:48,359;You're supposed
789;00:46:46,625;00:46:48,359;to know everything.
790;00:46:48,393;00:46:51,296;No man can be in all
790;00:46:48,393;00:46:51,296;rooms at all times.
791;00:46:51,330;00:46:54,366;I have many little birds
791;00:46:51,330;00:46:54,366;in the North, My Lord,
792;00:46:54,400;00:46:56,201;but I haven't heard
792;00:46:54,400;00:46:56,201;their songs
793;00:46:56,235;00:46:58,936;since Theon Greyjoy
793;00:46:56,235;00:46:58,936;captured Winterfell.
794;00:46:58,971;00:47:00,572;The Stark forces
794;00:46:58,971;00:47:00,572;are distracted.
795;00:47:00,606;00:47:02,540;Now is the time
795;00:47:00,606;00:47:02,540;to strike.
796;00:47:02,575;00:47:04,308;To strike?
797;00:47:04,343;00:47:06,310;My dear nephew,
797;00:47:04,343;00:47:06,310;you do see these men
798;00:47:06,345;00:47:08,012;preparing the walls
798;00:47:06,345;00:47:08,012;for siege?
799;00:47:08,046;00:47:11,582;You do understand
799;00:47:08,046;00:47:11,582;Stannis Baratheon sails this way?
800;00:47:11,616;00:47:14,017;If my Uncle Stannis lands on
800;00:47:11,616;00:47:14,017;the shores of King's Landing,
801;00:47:14,052;00:47:16,019;I'll ride out
801;00:47:14,052;00:47:16,019;to greet him.
802;00:47:16,053;00:47:17,954;A brave choice,
802;00:47:16,053;00:47:17,954;Your Grace.
803;00:47:17,989;00:47:20,823;I'm sure your men
803;00:47:17,989;00:47:20,823;will line up behind you.
804;00:47:20,857;00:47:23,759;They say Stannis
804;00:47:20,857;00:47:23,759;never smiles.
805;00:47:23,793;00:47:26,461;I'll give him
805;00:47:23,793;00:47:26,461;a red smile
806;00:47:26,496;00:47:28,630;from ear to ear.
807;00:47:33,103;00:47:36,005;Imagine Stannis's terror.
808;00:47:36,039;00:47:38,107;I am trying.
809;00:47:39,276;00:47:41,010;You're
809;00:47:39,276;00:47:41,010;an intelligent man.
810;00:47:41,044;00:47:42,745;I'd like to think
810;00:47:41,044;00:47:42,745;I'm an intelligent man.
811;00:47:42,780;00:47:44,347;Oh, no one disputes
811;00:47:42,780;00:47:44,347;that, My Lord,
812;00:47:44,381;00:47:46,649;not even the multitudes
812;00:47:44,381;00:47:46,649;who despise you.
813;00:47:46,684;00:47:49,586;I wish we could converse
813;00:47:46,684;00:47:49,586;as two honest, intelligent men.
814;00:47:49,621;00:47:51,455;I wish we could, too.
815;00:47:53,725;00:47:55,693;What do you want?
816;00:47:55,727;00:47:57,929;Tell me.
817;00:47:57,963;00:47:59,831;If we're going to play,
818;00:47:59,865;00:48:02,167;you'll have to start.
819;00:48:06,372;00:48:10,307;My brother was the youngest
819;00:48:06,372;00:48:10,307;Kingsguard in history.
820;00:48:10,342;00:48:14,144;My sister became queen
820;00:48:10,342;00:48:14,144;at the age of 19.
821;00:48:15,813;00:48:17,580;When I reached manhood,
822;00:48:17,615;00:48:19,441;my father put me
822;00:48:17,615;00:48:19,441;in charge of all the drains
823;00:48:19,466;00:48:21,327;and cisterns in Casterly Rock.
824;00:48:21,685;00:48:23,719;A most highborn plumber.
825;00:48:23,754;00:48:25,855;The water never
825;00:48:23,754;00:48:25,855;flowed better.
826;00:48:25,889;00:48:28,825;And all the shit
826;00:48:25,889;00:48:28,825;found its way to the sea.
827;00:48:28,859;00:48:31,662;I never expected
827;00:48:28,859;00:48:31,662;to have any real power.
828;00:48:31,696;00:48:33,898;So when my father
828;00:48:31,696;00:48:33,898;named me acting Hand--
829;00:48:33,933;00:48:36,034;You're quite good
829;00:48:33,933;00:48:36,034;at being Hand, you know?
830;00:48:36,068;00:48:38,904;Jon Arryn and Ned Stark
830;00:48:36,068;00:48:38,904;were good men,
831;00:48:38,938;00:48:40,972;honorable men,
832;00:48:41,007;00:48:43,843;but they disdained the game
832;00:48:41,007;00:48:43,843;and those who played.
833;00:48:43,877;00:48:46,412;You enjoy the game.
833;00:48:43,877;00:48:46,412;I do.
834;00:48:46,446;00:48:48,948;Last thing I expected.
835;00:48:48,982;00:48:50,449;And you play it well.
836;00:48:50,483;00:48:52,551;I'd like to keep
836;00:48:50,483;00:48:52,551;playing it.
837;00:48:55,055;00:48:57,990;If Stannis breaches
837;00:48:55,055;00:48:57,990;the gates, the game is over.
838;00:48:58,024;00:49:00,658;They say he burns
838;00:48:58,024;00:49:00,658;his enemies alive
839;00:49:00,693;00:49:02,728;to honor
839;00:49:00,693;00:49:02,728;the Lord of Light.
840;00:49:02,762;00:49:05,096;The Lord of Light
840;00:49:02,762;00:49:05,096;wants his enemies burned,
841;00:49:05,131;00:49:07,632;the Drowned God
841;00:49:05,131;00:49:07,632;wants them drowned.
842;00:49:07,667;00:49:09,668;Why are all the Gods
842;00:49:07,667;00:49:09,668;such vicious cunts?
843;00:49:09,703;00:49:13,239;Where is the God
843;00:49:09,703;00:49:13,239;of tits and wine?
844;00:49:13,273;00:49:15,174;In the Summer Isles,
845;00:49:15,208;00:49:18,210;they worship a fertility
845;00:49:15,208;00:49:18,210;goddess with 16 teats.
846;00:49:18,245;00:49:20,913;We should sail there
846;00:49:18,245;00:49:20,913;immediately.
847;00:49:22,750;00:49:26,119;This morning
847;00:49:22,750;00:49:26,119;I heard a song
848;00:49:26,153;00:49:29,655;all the way from Qarth
848;00:49:26,153;00:49:29,655;beyond the Red Waste.
849;00:49:29,690;00:49:31,657;Daenerys Targaryen lives.
850;00:49:33,360;00:49:36,262;A girl at the edge of the world
850;00:49:33,360;00:49:36,262;is the least of our problems.
851;00:49:36,297;00:49:38,730;She has three dragons.
852;00:49:40,300;00:49:42,534;But even if what
852;00:49:40,300;00:49:42,534;they say is true,
853;00:49:42,568;00:49:45,503;it'll be years before
853;00:49:42,568;00:49:45,503;they are fully grown.
854;00:49:45,538;00:49:48,206;And then there will be
854;00:49:45,538;00:49:48,206;nowhere to hide.
855;00:49:49,709;00:49:51,610;One game at a time,
855;00:49:49,709;00:49:51,610;my friend.
856;00:49:51,644;00:49:54,145;( Men shouting )
857;00:50:01,787;00:50:03,954;Jorah:
857;00:50:01,787;00:50:03,954;Careful, Khaleesi.
858;00:50:03,989;00:50:06,370;Xaro owns this city
858;00:50:03,989;00:50:06,370;and the warlocks have 1,000
859;00:50:06,395;00:50:08,160;eyes watching for you.
860;00:50:08,760;00:50:11,629;I found one--
861;00:50:11,663;00:50:14,130;a ship with
861;00:50:11,663;00:50:14,130;a good captain.
862;00:50:14,165;00:50:16,767;She leaves for
862;00:50:14,165;00:50:16,767;Astapor tomorrow.
863;00:50:16,801;00:50:18,969;Astapor?
863;00:50:16,801;00:50:18,969;We cannot stay here.
864;00:50:19,003;00:50:20,256;They have my dragons.
865;00:50:20,281;00:50:22,189;A mother does not flee
865;00:50:20,281;00:50:22,189;without her children.
866;00:50:22,307;00:50:24,374;They're not your children.
867;00:50:24,409;00:50:27,010;I know they call you
867;00:50:24,409;00:50:27,010;the Mother of Dragons
868;00:50:27,044;00:50:29,813;and I know you love them, but you
868;00:50:27,044;00:50:29,813;didn't grow them in your womb.
869;00:50:29,847;00:50:32,415;They didn't suckle at your breast.
869;00:50:29,847;00:50:32,415;They are dragons, Khaleesi.
870;00:50:32,449;00:50:34,851;And if we stay
870;00:50:32,449;00:50:34,851;in Qarth, we'll die.
871;00:50:34,885;00:50:37,954;You should sail to Astapor.
871;00:50:34,885;00:50:37,954;I'm sure you'll be safe there.
872;00:50:40,424;00:50:43,526;You know
872;00:50:40,424;00:50:43,526;I would die for you.
873;00:50:43,560;00:50:46,262;I will never
873;00:50:43,560;00:50:46,262;abandon you.
874;00:50:46,296;00:50:48,598;I'm sworn to protect you,
874;00:50:46,296;00:50:48,598;to serve.
875;00:50:48,632;00:50:50,700;Then serve me.
876;00:50:50,734;00:50:53,031;If my dragons are in
876;00:50:50,734;00:50:53,031;the House of the Undying,
877;00:50:53,056;00:50:54,203;then take me there.
878;00:50:54,204;00:50:56,105;That's what
878;00:50:54,204;00:50:56,105;the warlock wants.
879;00:50:56,139;00:50:57,941;He told you so himself.
880;00:50:57,975;00:51:00,610;If you enter that place,
880;00:50:57,975;00:51:00,610;you will never leave again.
881;00:51:00,644;00:51:03,647;His magic is strong.
881;00:51:00,644;00:51:03,647;And what of my magic?
882;00:51:03,681;00:51:05,682;You saw me step
882;00:51:03,681;00:51:05,682;into the fire.
883;00:51:05,717;00:51:08,185;You watched the witch burn.
883;00:51:05,717;00:51:08,185;What did the flames do to me?
884;00:51:08,219;00:51:10,154;Do you remember?
885;00:51:12,124;00:51:15,427;Until my last breath
885;00:51:12,124;00:51:15,427;I will remember.
886;00:51:16,963;00:51:20,099;After I have forgotten
886;00:51:16,963;00:51:20,099;my mother's face.
887;00:51:24,439;00:51:27,040;They are my children.
888;00:51:27,075;00:51:31,411;And they are the only
888;00:51:27,075;00:51:31,411;children I will ever have.
889;00:51:37,017;00:51:39,152;Take me to them.
890;00:51:50,964;00:51:53,199;We should bury them.
891;00:51:53,233;00:51:55,534;I'd leave 'em up
891;00:51:53,233;00:51:55,534;a few more days.
892;00:51:55,569;00:51:57,636;Sends a message.
893;00:51:57,671;00:51:59,271;If they haven't got
893;00:51:57,671;00:51:59,271;the damn message yet,
894;00:51:59,305;00:52:01,340;a few more days
894;00:51:59,305;00:52:01,340;won't help.
895;00:52:01,374;00:52:02,975;As you say.
896;00:52:03,009;00:52:05,944;But it don't hurt to let
896;00:52:03,009;00:52:05,944;'em rot a while longer.
897;00:52:05,979;00:52:07,880;What's this?
898;00:52:07,914;00:52:10,216;Gold for the farmer.
899;00:52:10,250;00:52:12,919;For his trouble.
900;00:52:12,953;00:52:14,321;His troubles are done.
901;00:52:14,355;00:52:17,925;He's feeding
901;00:52:14,355;00:52:17,925;the crops now.
902;00:52:17,959;00:52:19,828;His wife, too.
903;00:52:21,664;00:52:24,533;You want to keep a man
903;00:52:21,664;00:52:24,533;silent, you silence him.
904;00:52:44,054;00:52:47,723;Got as far as the farm
904;00:52:44,054;00:52:47,723;and then doubled back.
905;00:52:49,359;00:52:52,495;Walked through the stream
905;00:52:49,359;00:52:52,495;to throw off the hounds.
906;00:52:54,465;00:52:57,800;Hoped this would be the
906;00:52:54,465;00:52:57,800;last place they'd think to look.
907;00:53:00,104;00:53:02,005;You're right...
908;00:53:02,040;00:53:04,741;so far.
909;00:53:04,775;00:53:07,010;Who was that out there
910;00:53:07,044;00:53:09,645;hung up the gates?
911;00:53:09,679;00:53:12,381;Must have been
911;00:53:09,679;00:53:12,381;the farmer's boys.
912;00:53:13,950;00:53:17,319;He killed them
912;00:53:13,950;00:53:17,319;and burned them
913;00:53:17,354;00:53:19,955;and passed them off
913;00:53:17,354;00:53:19,955;as the little lords?
914;00:53:19,990;00:53:21,757;Shh, shh, shh.
915;00:53:21,791;00:53:24,426;They mustn't know.
916;00:53:24,461;00:53:27,162;Bran would blame
916;00:53:24,461;00:53:27,162;himself.
917;00:53:27,196;00:53:30,765;Osha: They'll never
917;00:53:27,196;00:53:30,765;hear it from me.
918;00:53:30,800;00:53:33,835;The little lads
918;00:53:30,800;00:53:33,835;have suffered enough.
