126;00:08:22,627;00:08:24,494;are traitors, too.
127;00:08:24,529;00:08:27,731;I am loyal
127;00:08:24,529;00:08:27,731;to my beloved Joffrey.
128;00:08:28,933;00:08:31,334;Of course you are.
129;00:08:32,970;00:08:36,839;Well, enjoy your name day,
129;00:08:32,970;00:08:36,839;Your Grace.
130;00:08:36,874;00:08:38,774;Wish I could stay
130;00:08:36,874;00:08:38,774;and celebrate,
131;00:08:38,809;00:08:41,577;but there is work
131;00:08:38,809;00:08:41,577;to be done.
132;00:08:41,611;00:08:43,612;What work?
133;00:08:43,647;00:08:45,781;Why are you here?
134;00:08:48,651;00:08:51,886;The raven arrived
134;00:08:48,651;00:08:51,886;from the Citadel
135;00:08:51,920;00:08:55,056;this morning, Your Grace.
136;00:08:55,090;00:08:57,959;The conclave has met,
136;00:08:55,090;00:08:57,959;considered reports
137;00:08:57,993;00:09:00,128;from Maesters all over
137;00:08:57,993;00:09:00,128;the Seven Kingdoms,
138;00:09:00,163;00:09:03,598;and declared
138;00:09:00,163;00:09:03,598;this great summer
139;00:09:03,632;00:09:06,434;done at last.
140;00:09:06,469;00:09:09,271;The longest summer
140;00:09:06,469;00:09:09,271;in living memory.
141;00:09:09,305;00:09:11,273;The peasants say,
141;00:09:09,305;00:09:11,273;a long summer means
142;00:09:11,307;00:09:14,210;an even longer winter.
142;00:09:11,307;00:09:14,210;- A common superstition.
143;00:09:14,244;00:09:17,280;We have enough wheat
143;00:09:14,244;00:09:17,280;for a five-year winter.
144;00:09:17,314;00:09:19,582;If it lasts any longer,
145;00:09:19,616;00:09:22,250;we'll have
145;00:09:19,616;00:09:22,250;fewer peasants.
146;00:09:22,285;00:09:25,253;The city's drowning in refugees,
146;00:09:22,285;00:09:25,253;Your Grace, fleeing the war.
147;00:09:25,287;00:09:26,754;We have nowhere
147;00:09:25,287;00:09:26,754;to house them.
148;00:09:26,788;00:09:28,923;And with winter coming,
148;00:09:26,788;00:09:28,923;it'll only get worse.
149;00:09:28,957;00:09:31,892;You command the City Watch,
149;00:09:28,957;00:09:31,892;do you not, Lord Slynt?
150;00:09:33,395;00:09:35,262;I do, Your Grace.
151;00:09:35,297;00:09:37,298;And are you not
151;00:09:35,297;00:09:37,298;a Lord at my command?
152;00:09:37,332;00:09:40,835;I owe my title and lands
152;00:09:37,332;00:09:40,835;to your generosity, Your Grace.
153;00:09:40,870;00:09:43,505;Then do your job.
153;00:09:40,870;00:09:43,505;Shut the gates to the peasants.
154;00:09:43,539;00:09:46,474;They belong in the field,
154;00:09:43,539;00:09:46,474;not our capital.
155;00:09:46,509;00:09:49,911;Yes, Your Grace.
156;00:09:54,616;00:09:56,250;Don't get up.
157;00:09:57,419;00:10:01,188;More ravishing than ever,
157;00:09:57,419;00:10:01,188;big sister.
158;00:10:02,257;00:10:04,992;War agrees with you.
159;00:10:05,027;00:10:07,928;Forgive the interruption.
159;00:10:05,027;00:10:07,928;Carry on.
160;00:10:09,163;00:10:10,564;What are you doing here?
161;00:10:10,598;00:10:14,300;Ah, it's been
161;00:10:10,598;00:10:14,300;a remarkable journey.
162;00:10:14,334;00:10:18,004;I pissed off the edge
162;00:10:14,334;00:10:18,004;of the Wall,
163;00:10:18,038;00:10:20,940;I slept in a sky cell,
164;00:10:20,974;00:10:23,209;I fought with
164;00:10:20,974;00:10:23,209;the hill tribes--
165;00:10:23,244;00:10:25,979;so many adventures,
166;00:10:26,013;00:10:28,716;so much to be
166;00:10:26,013;00:10:28,716;thankful for.
167;00:10:28,750;00:10:32,020;What are you doing here?
167;00:10:28,750;00:10:32,020;This is the small council.
168;00:10:32,782;00:10:34,382;Yes. well I, do believe,
168;00:10:32,782;00:10:34,382;the Hand of the King,
169;00:10:35,425;00:10:37,326;is welcome at all
169;00:10:35,425;00:10:37,326;small council meetings.
170;00:10:37,360;00:10:39,362;Our father
170;00:10:37,360;00:10:39,362;is Hand of the King.
171;00:10:39,396;00:10:42,432;Yes, but in his absence...
172;00:10:49,606;00:10:51,841;Your father has named
172;00:10:49,606;00:10:51,841;Lord Tyrion
173;00:10:51,876;00:10:54,611;to serve as Hand
173;00:10:51,876;00:10:54,611;in his stead while he fights.
174;00:10:54,645;00:10:57,313;Out! All of you out!
175;00:11:01,986;00:11:04,688;I would like to know
175;00:11:01,986;00:11:04,688;how you tricked father into this.
176;00:11:04,722;00:11:06,690;If I were capable
176;00:11:04,722;00:11:06,690;of tricking father,
177;00:11:06,724;00:11:08,325;I'd be emperor
177;00:11:06,724;00:11:08,325;of the world by now.
178;00:11:08,359;00:11:10,961;You brought this
178;00:11:08,359;00:11:10,961;on yourself.
179;00:11:10,995;00:11:12,462;I've done nothing.
180;00:11:12,497;00:11:14,364;Quite right--
180;00:11:12,497;00:11:14,364;you did nothing
181;00:11:14,399;00:11:16,766;when your son called
181;00:11:14,399;00:11:16,766;for Ned Stark's head.
182;00:11:16,801;00:11:18,768;Now the entire North
182;00:11:16,801;00:11:18,768;has risen up against us.
183;00:11:18,803;00:11:21,271;I tried to stop it.
183;00:11:18,803;00:11:21,271;Did you? You failed.
184;00:11:21,305;00:11:24,441;That bit of theater will haunt
184;00:11:21,305;00:11:24,441;our family for a generation.
185;00:11:24,475;00:11:28,478;Robb Stark is a child.
185;00:11:24,475;00:11:28,478;Who's won every battle he's fought.
186;00:11:28,512;00:11:30,714;Do you understand
186;00:11:28,512;00:11:30,714;we're losing the war?
187;00:11:30,748;00:11:33,984;What do you know about warfare?
187;00:11:30,748;00:11:33,984;Nothing.
188;00:11:34,018;00:11:35,786;But I know people.
189;00:11:35,820;00:11:37,888;And I know that our enemies hate
189;00:11:35,820;00:11:37,888;each other
190;00:11:37,922;00:11:40,824;almost as much
190;00:11:37,922;00:11:40,824;as they hate us.
191;00:11:45,130;00:11:47,765;Joffrey is King.
191;00:11:45,130;00:11:47,765;Joffrey is King.
192;00:11:47,799;00:11:50,334;You are here
192;00:11:47,799;00:11:50,334;to advise him.
193;00:11:50,368;00:11:52,036;I'm only here
193;00:11:50,368;00:11:52,036;to advise him.
194;00:11:52,070;00:11:54,605;And if the King listens
194;00:11:52,070;00:11:54,605;to what I say,
195;00:11:54,640;00:11:58,275;the King might just get
195;00:11:54,640;00:11:58,275;his Uncle Jaime back.
196;00:11:59,978;00:12:01,478;How?
197;00:12:01,513;00:12:03,080;You love your children.
198;00:12:03,114;00:12:04,614;It's your one
198;00:12:03,114;00:12:04,614;redeeming quality.
199;00:12:04,648;00:12:07,583;That and your cheekbones.
200;00:12:07,618;00:12:10,452;The Starks love
200;00:12:07,618;00:12:10,452;their children as well.
201;00:12:10,487;00:12:13,088;And we have two of them.
201;00:12:10,487;00:12:13,088;One.
202;00:12:14,691;00:12:17,659;One?
202;00:12:14,691;00:12:17,659;Arya, little animal-- she disappeared.
203;00:12:17,694;00:12:20,729;Disappeared?
203;00:12:17,694;00:12:20,729;What, in a puff of smoke?
204;00:12:22,465;00:12:25,801;We had three Starks
204;00:12:22,465;00:12:25,801;to trade.
205;00:12:25,835;00:12:28,571;You chopped one's head off
205;00:12:25,835;00:12:28,571;and let another escape.
206;00:12:29,473;00:12:31,573;Father will be furious.
207;00:12:32,642;00:12:34,243;It must be odd for you...
208;00:12:36,747;00:12:39,048;to be the disappointing child.
209;00:12:46,558;00:12:50,394;My Lord, may the Old Gods
209;00:12:46,558;00:12:50,394;watch over your brother
210;00:12:50,429;00:12:53,097;and all our northern sons.
211;00:12:53,132;00:12:57,101;The walls of my Holdfast
211;00:12:53,132;00:12:57,101;will not stand the winter.
212;00:12:57,136;00:13:01,005;The stones were last mortared
212;00:12:57,136;00:13:01,005;in the time of King Aerys,
213;00:13:01,039;00:13:03,407;and I'm afraid
213;00:13:01,039;00:13:03,407;the masons today
214;00:13:03,441;00:13:07,177;are not fit to carry
214;00:13:03,441;00:13:07,177;their fathers' hammers.
215;00:13:07,211;00:13:09,612;When I was a boy,
215;00:13:07,211;00:13:09,612;I remember seeing them
216;00:13:09,647;00:13:14,216;put up a new tower
216;00:13:09,647;00:13:14,216;at Torrhen's Square in a summer.
217;00:13:14,251;00:13:16,352;Men worked back then.
218;00:13:16,386;00:13:19,288;Today, my Holdfast
218;00:13:16,386;00:13:19,288;looks like it was built
219;00:13:19,323;00:13:21,557;by drunk children.
220;00:13:21,592;00:13:25,729;At night you can hear the wind
220;00:13:21,592;00:13:25,729;howling through the gaps.
221;00:13:25,763;00:13:27,731;And the Gods
221;00:13:25,763;00:13:27,731;forbid it rains.
222;00:13:27,765;00:13:31,001;Why, I might as well sleep
222;00:13:27,765;00:13:31,001;beneath a waterfall.
223;00:13:31,035;00:13:32,670;Maintenance of a Holdfast
224;00:13:32,704;00:13:36,107;generally falls
224;00:13:32,704;00:13:36,107;to the lord of that Holdfast.
225;00:13:36,142;00:13:37,609;Generally, yes,
226;00:13:37,643;00:13:39,310;but I've sent
226;00:13:37,643;00:13:39,310;all the young men off
227;00:13:39,344;00:13:41,246;to fight
227;00:13:39,344;00:13:41,246;Robb Stark's war.
228;00:13:41,280;00:13:44,382;King Robb.
228;00:13:41,280;00:13:44,382;And it's not his war.
229;00:13:44,416;00:13:46,317;He didn't choose it.
230;00:13:46,351;00:13:47,785;Maybe not, My Lord,
231;00:13:47,819;00:13:49,920;but he called in his Banners
231;00:13:47,819;00:13:49,920;and took the men.
232;00:13:49,954;00:13:51,688;Joffrey killed my father,
233;00:13:51,722;00:13:54,157;your liege lord.
234;00:13:54,191;00:13:56,659;Do you remember
234;00:13:54,191;00:13:56,659;your vows, Ser?
235;00:13:56,693;00:13:58,561;Of course I remember!
236;00:13:58,595;00:14:01,664;We can spare four masons
236;00:13:58,595;00:14:01,664;for a week, My Lord.
237;00:14:01,698;00:14:04,734;Will that be sufficient
237;00:14:01,698;00:14:04,734;to repair your walls?
238;00:14:04,768;00:14:07,070;I-- I believe it will.
239;00:14:13,011;00:14:15,380;We didn't want him here
239;00:14:13,011;00:14:15,380;all day, did we?
240;00:14:16,649;00:14:19,684;I didn't like the way
240;00:14:16,649;00:14:19,684;he was talking about Robb.
241;00:14:19,719;00:14:21,519;Nor did I.
242;00:14:23,789;00:14:26,657;But listening to people
242;00:14:23,789;00:14:26,657;you'd rather not listen to
243;00:14:26,692;00:14:30,762;is one of your responsibilities
243;00:14:26,692;00:14:30,762;as Lord of Winterfell.
244;00:14:33,665;00:14:35,933;Lord Portan.
245;00:14:35,967;00:14:39,002;My Lord, may the Old Gods
245;00:14:35,967;00:14:39,002;watch over your brother
246;00:14:39,036;00:14:40,770;and all our northern sons.
247;00:15:29,722;00:15:34,160;Boil this for an hour
247;00:15:29,722;00:15:34,160;and drink the tea.
248;00:15:34,194;00:15:36,697;Makes all your pain
248;00:15:34,194;00:15:36,697;go away.
249;00:15:36,731;00:15:39,366;Don't have any pain.
250;00:15:39,400;00:15:41,000;Lucky for you.
251;00:15:42,069;00:15:43,903;That way.
252;00:15:46,640;00:15:48,875;You've been having
252;00:15:46,640;00:15:48,875;those dreams again.
253;00:15:48,909;00:15:50,743;I don't dream.
254;00:15:50,777;00:15:52,311;Everyone dreams.
255;00:15:52,345;00:15:55,280;I don't.
256;00:15:55,314;00:15:57,382;Heard some of the men
256;00:15:55,314;00:15:57,382;talking about the comet.
257;00:15:57,416;00:15:59,551;They say it's an omen.
258;00:15:59,585;00:16:03,255;They say it means Robb will win
258;00:15:59,585;00:16:03,255;a great victory in the South.
259;00:16:03,289;00:16:04,890;Did they?
260;00:16:06,659;00:16:10,229;I heard some other fools
260;00:16:06,659;00:16:10,229;say it's Lannister Red.
261;00:16:10,264;00:16:13,633;Means the Lannisters will rule
261;00:16:10,264;00:16:13,633;all Seven Kingdoms before long.
262;00:16:13,667;00:16:17,070;Heard a stableboy say
262;00:16:13,667;00:16:17,070;it's the color of blood
263;00:16:17,104;00:16:19,473;to mark the death
263;00:16:17,104;00:16:19,473;of your father.
264;00:16:23,311;00:16:26,546;The stars
264;00:16:23,311;00:16:26,546;don't fall for men.
265;00:16:26,580;00:16:29,148;The red comet means
265;00:16:26,580;00:16:29,148;one thing, boy--
266;00:16:30,283;00:16:31,884;dragons.
267;00:16:33,720;00:16:36,454;The dragons are all dead.
268;00:16:36,489;00:16:38,957;They've been dead
268;00:16:36,489;00:16:38,957;for centuries.
269;00:17:15,495;00:17:17,263;Mmm.
270;00:17:17,297;00:17:20,232;Mmm. Mmm.
271;00:17:22,335;00:17:24,970;What did your brother say
271;00:17:22,335;00:17:24,970;about them, Khaleesi?
272;00:17:25,004;00:17:26,672;He said they ate meat.
273;00:17:26,707;00:17:30,409;He didn't tell you
273;00:17:26,707;00:17:30,409;what kind of meat?
274;00:17:30,443;00:17:33,345;My brother didn't know
274;00:17:30,443;00:17:33,345;anything about dragons.
275;00:17:33,379;00:17:36,514;He didn't know anything
275;00:17:33,379;00:17:36,514;about anything.
276;00:17:41,454;00:17:43,989;Eh.
277;00:18:10,318;00:18:12,386;She was Drogo's
277;00:18:10,318;00:18:12,386;first gift to me.
278;00:18:12,420;00:18:15,422;I remember.
279;00:18:17,291;00:18:19,927;I promised
279;00:18:17,291;00:18:19,927;to protect them.
280;00:18:19,961;00:18:22,295;Promised them their enemies
280;00:18:19,961;00:18:22,295;would die screaming.
281;00:18:22,330;00:18:24,831;How do I make
281;00:18:22,330;00:18:24,831;starvation scream?
282;00:18:24,866;00:18:27,868;A trick I never learned,
282;00:18:24,866;00:18:27,868;I'm afraid.
283;00:18:29,704;00:18:31,771;Does it ever end?
284;00:18:31,806;00:18:33,773;This is farther east
284;00:18:31,806;00:18:33,773;than I've ever been.
285;00:18:33,807;00:18:35,341;But, yes, Khaleesi,
286;00:18:35,376;00:18:36,843;everything ends,
286;00:18:35,376;00:18:36,843;even the red waste.
287;00:18:36,877;00:18:39,445;And you're sure
287;00:18:36,877;00:18:39,445;there's no other way?
288;00:18:39,480;00:18:42,215;If we go south to the land
288;00:18:39,480;00:18:42,215;of the Lazarheen,
289;00:18:42,249;00:18:44,717;the Lamb Men will kill us
289;00:18:42,249;00:18:44,717;and take your dragons.
290;00:18:44,752;00:18:46,652;If we go west
290;00:18:44,752;00:18:46,652;to the Dothraki Sea,
291;00:18:46,687;00:18:48,721;the first
291;00:18:46,687;00:18:48,721;Khalasar we meet
292;00:18:48,755;00:18:50,289;will kill us
292;00:18:48,755;00:18:50,289;and take your dragons.
293;00:18:50,323;00:18:52,992;No one will take
293;00:18:50,323;00:18:52,992;my dragons.
294;00:18:54,161;00:18:56,863;They are too weak to fight,
295;00:18:56,897;00:18:58,898;as are your people.
296;00:18:58,932;00:19:01,268;You must be
296;00:18:58,932;00:19:01,268;their strength.
297;00:19:02,203;00:19:04,338;As you are mine.
298;00:19:51,318;00:19:54,254;Rakharo...
299;00:20:00,762;00:20:03,531;You never have.
300;00:20:08,369;00:20:12,205;This is bad time to start.
301;00:21:08,297;00:21:10,265;Having a rough time of it?
302;00:21:10,299;00:21:11,866;Nothing's killed me yet.
303;00:21:11,901;00:21:14,469;Your ass killed the sledge.
303;00:21:11,901;00:21:14,469;You offered me a ride.
304;00:21:14,504;00:21:17,739;I just wanted you to shut up about
304;00:21:14,504;00:21:17,739;your damn blisters.
305;00:21:31,753;00:21:34,555;I was born in a place
305;00:21:31,753;00:21:34,555;like this.
306;00:21:34,590;00:21:37,725;Later, I fell
306;00:21:34,590;00:21:37,725;on hard times.
307;00:21:39,361;00:21:41,128;Are those girls?
308;00:21:41,162;00:21:42,963;Craster's daughters.
309;00:21:42,998;00:21:46,734;I haven't seen a girl
309;00:21:42,998;00:21:46,734;in six months.
310;00:21:46,768;00:21:48,703;I'd keep on not seeing them
310;00:21:46,768;00:21:48,703;if I were you.
311;00:21:48,737;00:21:52,139;What, he don't like people messing
311;00:21:48,737;00:21:52,139;with his daughters?
312;00:21:52,174;00:21:54,976;He don't like people
312;00:21:52,174;00:21:54,976;messing with his wives.
313;00:21:56,345;00:21:58,579;He marries
313;00:21:56,345;00:21:58,579;his daughters,
314;00:21:58,614;00:22:00,949;and they give him
314;00:21:58,614;00:22:00,949;more daughters.
315;00:22:00,983;00:22:03,184;And on and on it goes.
316;00:22:03,219;00:22:05,653;That's foul.
316;00:22:03,219;00:22:05,653;It's beyond foul.
317;00:22:05,687;00:22:09,591;All the other wildlings for a
317;00:22:05,687;00:22:09,591;hundred leagues have disappeared.
318;00:22:09,625;00:22:11,592;Craster's still here.
319;00:22:11,627;00:22:14,262;He must be doing
319;00:22:11,627;00:22:14,262;something right.
320;00:22:15,898;00:22:17,599;What happens
320;00:22:15,898;00:22:17,599;to the boys?
321;00:22:17,633;00:22:20,668;Hmm?
321;00:22:17,633;00:22:20,668;He marries his daughters.
322;00:22:20,703;00:22:23,605;What does he do
322;00:22:20,703;00:22:23,605;with his sons?
323;00:22:25,942;00:22:28,643;He said he planned
323;00:22:25,942;00:22:28,643;to stop here
324;00:22:28,678;00:22:30,245;on his way
324;00:22:28,678;00:22:30,245;to the Frostfangs.
325;00:22:30,279;00:22:31,880;People make
325;00:22:30,279;00:22:31,880;all sorts of plans.
326;00:22:31,914;00:22:35,350;I haven't seen Benjen Stark
326;00:22:31,914;00:22:35,350;in three years.
327;00:22:35,384;00:22:36,851;Haven't missed him.
328;00:22:36,886;00:22:39,621;Always treated me
328;00:22:36,886;00:22:39,621;like scum.
329;00:22:40,890;00:22:43,525;Haven't had any good wine
329;00:22:40,890;00:22:43,525;for a long time.
330;00:22:43,559;00:22:46,561;You Southerners make good wine,
330;00:22:43,559;00:22:46,561;I'll give you that.
331;00:22:46,595;00:22:48,630;We're not Southerners.
332;00:22:48,665;00:22:50,399;Who's this little girl?
333;00:22:51,868;00:22:54,670;You're prettier
333;00:22:51,868;00:22:54,670;than half my daughters.
334;00:22:54,705;00:22:58,040;You got a nice wet twat
334;00:22:54,705;00:22:58,040;between your legs?
335;00:22:58,074;00:22:59,808;What's your name?
336;00:22:59,843;00:23:01,843;Jon Snow.
336;00:22:59,843;00:23:01,843;Snow, eh?
337;00:23:01,878;00:23:04,712;Listen to me, bastard.
338;00:23:04,747;00:23:08,716;All you lot from south of the Wall,
338;00:23:04,747;00:23:08,716;you're Southerners.
339;00:23:08,750;00:23:12,620;But now you're in the North,
339;00:23:08,750;00:23:12,620;the real North.
340;00:23:12,654;00:23:14,254;The lad meant no harm.
341;00:23:15,757;00:23:18,992;I catch that pretty little bastard
341;00:23:15,757;00:23:18,992;talking to my daughters--
342;00:23:19,027;00:23:23,164;No one will talk to your daughters,
342;00:23:19,027;00:23:23,164;you have my word.
343;00:23:23,198;00:23:26,535;Now, sit down
343;00:23:23,198;00:23:26,535;and shut your mouth.
344;00:23:29,239;00:23:31,541;You bring any of that
344;00:23:29,239;00:23:31,541;good wine with you?
345;00:23:31,575;00:23:33,410;We did.
346;00:23:33,444;00:23:35,946;We passed through
346;00:23:33,444;00:23:35,946;six villages on the way here.
347;00:23:35,980;00:23:37,814;All six were abandoned.
348;00:23:37,849;00:23:40,917;Where have all
348;00:23:37,849;00:23:40,917;the wildlings gone?
349;00:23:40,951;00:23:44,487;I could tell you,
349;00:23:40,951;00:23:44,487;but I'm thirsty.
350;00:23:44,521;00:23:46,623;There's a barrel of
350;00:23:44,521;00:23:46,623;Dornish wine on the sledge.
351;00:23:46,657;00:23:49,392;Bring it in here.
351;00:23:46,657;00:23:49,392;- Yes, commander.
352;00:23:49,426;00:23:52,595;You want to know
352;00:23:49,426;00:23:52,595;where they've all gone?
353;00:23:52,629;00:23:56,932;North... to join up
353;00:23:52,629;00:23:56,932;with Mance Rayder...
354;00:23:58,101;00:23:59,834;Your old friend.
355;00:23:59,869;00:24:02,504;He's no friend of mine.
356;00:24:02,539;00:24:05,671;He broke his vows,
356;00:24:02,539;00:24:05,671;betrayed his brothers.
357;00:24:05,696;00:24:06,896;Oh, aye.
358;00:24:07,010;00:24:10,080;But once he was
358;00:24:07,010;00:24:10,080;just a poor black crow.
359;00:24:10,114;00:24:13,050;And now he's
359;00:24:10,114;00:24:13,050;King-Beyond-the-Wall.
360;00:24:13,085;00:24:15,553;He's been calling
360;00:24:13,085;00:24:15,553;himself that for years.
361;00:24:15,587;00:24:19,324;What's he king of?
361;00:24:15,587;00:24:19,324;A frozen lake somewhere?
362;00:24:20,693;00:24:22,761;That's a good-looking axe.
363;00:24:22,795;00:24:24,930;Fresh forged?
364;00:24:26,933;00:24:29,468;Give it here.
365;00:24:29,502;00:24:31,670;You'll have another one
365;00:24:29,502;00:24:31,670;made at Castle Black.
366;00:24:31,705;00:24:33,606;Here.
367;00:24:33,640;00:24:37,443;Oh, that's some
367;00:24:33,640;00:24:37,443;lovely steel.
368;00:24:41,147;00:24:44,283;You want to know
368;00:24:41,147;00:24:44,283;what Mance Rayder is doing?
369;00:24:44,317;00:24:46,118;Gathering an army.
370;00:24:46,186;00:24:48,387;What I hear,
370;00:24:46,186;00:24:48,387;he's already got more men
371;00:24:48,421;00:24:50,723;than any of your
371;00:24:48,421;00:24:50,723;southern kings.
372;00:24:50,757;00:24:53,259;And where does he plan
372;00:24:50,757;00:24:53,259;marching this army?
373;00:24:53,293;00:24:54,760;When you're
373;00:24:53,293;00:24:54,760;all the way north,
374;00:24:54,794;00:24:56,529;there's only
374;00:24:54,794;00:24:56,529;one direction to go.
375;00:24:58,732;00:25:03,369;These are bad times to be
375;00:24:58,732;00:25:03,369;living alone in the wild.
376;00:25:03,404;00:25:06,706;The cold winds
376;00:25:03,404;00:25:06,706;are rising.
377;00:25:06,741;00:25:10,243;Let them come.
377;00:25:06,741;00:25:10,243;My roots are sunk deep.
378;00:25:11,746;00:25:13,746;Wife...
379;00:25:13,781;00:25:17,817;tell the Lord Crow
379;00:25:13,781;00:25:17,817;how content we are.
380;00:25:17,851;00:25:20,219;This is our place.
381;00:25:20,253;00:25:22,154;Our husband keeps us safe.
382;00:25:22,189;00:25:25,358;Better to live free
382;00:25:22,189;00:25:25,358;than die a slave.
383;00:25:27,127;00:25:30,630;Don't it make you
383;00:25:27,127;00:25:30,630;jealous, old man,
384;00:25:30,664;00:25:32,732;to see me with
384;00:25:30,664;00:25:32,732;all these young wives
385;00:25:32,766;00:25:36,035;and you with no one
385;00:25:32,766;00:25:36,035;to warm your bed?
386;00:25:36,069;00:25:38,004;We chose different paths.
387;00:25:38,038;00:25:42,475;Oh, aye, and you chose the path
387;00:25:38,038;00:25:42,475;with no one but boys on it.
388;00:25:44,344;00:25:47,479;You'll be wanting to sleep
388;00:25:44,344;00:25:47,479;beneath my roof, I suppose,
389;00:25:47,514;00:25:49,581;and eat me out of pigs.
390;00:25:49,616;00:25:51,517;A roof would be welcome.
391;00:25:51,551;00:25:53,085;It's been hard riding.
392;00:25:53,119;00:25:56,321;We've brought our own food
392;00:25:53,119;00:25:56,321;and good steel for you.
393;00:25:58,925;00:26:01,660;Any man lays a hand
393;00:25:58,925;00:26:01,660;on one of my wives,
394;00:26:01,694;00:26:04,663;he loses the hand.
395;00:26:06,499;00:26:10,301;And I see this one
395;00:26:06,499;00:26:10,301;staring too long,
396;00:26:10,336;00:26:13,571;I might just gouge
396;00:26:10,336;00:26:13,571;his eyes out.
397;00:26:13,605;00:26:16,875;Your roof, your rules.
398;00:26:29,857;00:26:32,158;Who am I?!
399;00:26:32,193;00:26:35,629;Who am I?!
399;00:26:32,193;00:26:35,629;Lord commander.
400;00:26:35,663;00:26:38,832;And who are you?
400;00:26:35,663;00:26:38,832;Jon Snow.
401;00:26:38,866;00:26:41,468;Who are you?
402;00:26:41,502;00:26:43,770;Your steward.
403;00:26:43,804;00:26:45,905;You want to lead
403;00:26:43,804;00:26:45,905;one day?
404;00:26:48,675;00:26:51,410;Then learn
404;00:26:48,675;00:26:51,410;how to follow.
405;00:27:08,929;00:27:13,666;Lord of Light, come to us
405;00:27:08,929;00:27:13,666;in our darkness.
406;00:27:13,700;00:27:17,404;We offer you
406;00:27:13,700;00:27:17,404;these false Gods.
407;00:27:17,438;00:27:20,373;Take them and cast
407;00:27:17,438;00:27:20,373;your light upon us...
408;00:27:22,076;00:27:26,112;For the night is dark
408;00:27:22,076;00:27:26,112;and full of terrors.
409;00:27:26,146;00:27:29,648;For the night is dark
409;00:27:26,146;00:27:29,648;and full of terrors.
410;00:27:31,617;00:27:33,551;After the long summer,
411;00:27:33,585;00:27:36,621;darkness will fall heavy
411;00:27:33,585;00:27:36,621;on the world.
412;00:27:36,655;00:27:39,357;The stars will bleed.
413;00:27:39,391;00:27:41,760;We need to stop her.
414;00:27:41,794;00:27:45,597;The cold breath of winter
414;00:27:41,794;00:27:45,597;will freeze the seas...
415;00:27:45,631;00:27:47,029;Not now.
416;00:27:47,054;00:27:48,254;...And the dead shall rise
416;00:27:47,054;00:27:48,254;in the North.
417;00:27:51,804;00:27:55,374;All you men were named
417;00:27:51,804;00:27:55,374;in the Light of the Seven!
418;00:27:55,409;00:27:58,544;Is this how you treat
418;00:27:55,409;00:27:58,544;the Gods of your fathers?
419;00:27:58,579;00:28:03,282;Are you so eager to spit
419;00:27:58,579;00:28:03,282;on your ancestors?
420;00:28:11,857;00:28:14,291;You smell of fear--
421;00:28:14,359;00:28:18,595;fear and piss
421;00:28:14,359;00:28:18,595;and old bones.
422;00:28:19,830;00:28:21,531;Do you want to stop me?
423;00:28:25,970;00:28:27,837;Stop me.
424;00:28:40,652;00:28:42,386;In the ancient books,
424;00:28:40,652;00:28:42,386;it's written
425;00:28:42,421;00:28:46,457;that a warrior will draw
425;00:28:42,421;00:28:46,457;a burning sword from the fire.
426;00:28:47,593;00:28:50,661;And that sword shall be
426;00:28:47,593;00:28:50,661;Lightbringer.
427;00:28:55,468;00:28:58,970;Stannis Baratheon,
428;00:28:59,004;00:29:01,572;warrior of light,
429;00:29:01,607;00:29:03,508;your sword awaits you.
430;00:29:33,774;00:29:37,243;Lord, cast your
430;00:29:33,774;00:29:37,243;light upon us!
431;00:29:38,778;00:29:42,114;For the night is dark
431;00:29:38,778;00:29:42,114;and full of terrors.
432;00:29:44,951;00:29:48,420;For the night is dark
432;00:29:44,951;00:29:48,420;and full of terror.
433;00:30:15,482;00:30:19,117;This woman will lead him
433;00:30:15,482;00:30:19,117;into a war he cannot win.
434;00:30:19,152;00:30:20,785;Stannis is our king.
435;00:30:20,820;00:30:22,153;We follow
435;00:30:20,820;00:30:22,153;where he leads,
436;00:30:22,188;00:30:24,889;even if we don't like the path.
436;00:30:22,188;00:30:24,889;King.
437;00:30:24,923;00:30:27,024;Since that boar
437;00:30:24,923;00:30:27,024;killed his brother,
438;00:30:27,059;00:30:29,093;every lord wants
438;00:30:27,059;00:30:29,093;a coronation.
439;00:30:29,127;00:30:31,228;I don't serve the others.
439;00:30:29,127;00:30:31,228;I serve Stannis.
440;00:30:31,263;00:30:34,965;As do I,
440;00:30:31,263;00:30:34,965;but loyal service
441;00:30:34,999;00:30:37,935;means telling
441;00:30:34,999;00:30:37,935;hard truths.
442;00:30:37,969;00:30:42,038;He's surrounded
442;00:30:37,969;00:30:42,038;by fools and fanatics,
443;00:30:42,073;00:30:44,841;but he trusts you, Davos.
444;00:30:44,876;00:30:47,978;If you tell him
444;00:30:44,876;00:30:47,978;the truth...
445;00:30:49,381;00:30:51,316;What's the truth?
446;00:31:03,963;00:31:05,764;And I declare upon
446;00:31:03,963;00:31:05,764;the honor of my house
447;00:31:05,798;00:31:07,232;that my beloved

448;00:31:07,266;00:31:09,868;he wasn't
448;00:31:07,266;00:31:09,868;my beloved brother.
449;00:31:09,902;00:31:12,103;I didn't love him.
449;00:31:09,902;00:31:12,103;He didn't love me.
450;00:31:12,138;00:31:13,972;A harmless courtesy,
450;00:31:12,138;00:31:13,972;Your Grace.
451;00:31:14,006;00:31:15,373;A lie.
451;00:31:14,006;00:31:15,373;Take it out.
452;00:31:18,310;00:31:20,211;...that my brother Robert
452;00:31:18,310;00:31:20,211;left no trueborn heirs,
453;00:31:20,245;00:31:22,647;the boy Joffrey,

456;00:31:27,921;00:31:30,823;Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.
457;00:31:30,857;00:31:33,659;Call him what he is.

460;00:31:36,631;00:31:39,867;i do this day lay claim--
461;00:31:39,901;00:31:43,036;Make it Ser Jaime Lannister,
461;00:31:39,901;00:31:43,036;the Kingslayer.
462;00:31:43,071;00:31:45,272;Whatever else he is,
462;00:31:43,071;00:31:45,272;the man's still a knight.

466;00:31:53,215;00:31:55,716;Let all true men
466;00:31:53,215;00:31:55,716;declare their loyalty.
467;00:31:55,751;00:31:58,085;When Eddard Stark learned
467;00:31:55,751;00:31:58,085;the truth, he told only me.

476;00:32:16,972;00:32:18,806;Well, many have already
476;00:32:16,972;00:32:18,806;declared for him--

479;00:32:24,279;00:32:25,847;The Lord of Light
479;00:32:24,279;00:32:25,847;stands behind him.
480;00:32:25,881;00:32:29,350;And how many ships has
480;00:32:25,881;00:32:29,350;the Lord of Light got in his fleet?
481;00:32:29,385;00:32:31,953;He has no need for ships.
481;00:32:29,385;00:32:31,953;I'm sure he doesn't,
482;00:32:31,987;00:32:33,388;but we do if we're
482;00:32:31,987;00:32:33,388;going to war.
483;00:32:33,422;00:32:36,491;If not Renly, Your Grace,
483;00:32:33,422;00:32:36,491;join forces with Robb Stark.
484;00:32:36,525;00:32:38,827;Who would steal
484;00:32:36,525;00:32:38,827;the northern half of my kingdom.
485;00:32:38,861;00:32:40,162;I've always served thieves

492;00:32:58,714;00:33:02,216;watch over us all.
493;00:33:02,251;00:33:04,618;Shall we drink together?
494;00:33:04,653;00:33:06,654;Don't.
495;00:33:06,688;00:33:11,493;A cup of wine to honor
495;00:33:06,688;00:33:11,493;the one true God.
496;00:33:57,610;00:34:00,812;The night is dark and full
496;00:33:57,610;00:34:00,812;of terrors, old man,
497;00:34:00,847;00:34:04,082;but the fire
497;00:34:00,847;00:34:04,082;burns them all away.
498;00:34:25,638;00:34:27,639;Your Grace.
499;00:34:39,019;00:34:41,688;King in the North.
500;00:34:43,624;00:34:45,425;I keep expecting you
500;00:34:43,624;00:34:45,425;to leave me
501;00:34:45,460;00:34:47,494;in one castle or another
501;00:34:45,460;00:34:47,494;for safekeeping,
502;00:34:47,529;00:34:51,565;but you drag me along
502;00:34:47,529;00:34:51,565;from camp to camp.
503;00:34:51,599;00:34:54,234;Have you grown
503;00:34:51,599;00:34:54,234;fond of me, Stark?
504;00:34:54,269;00:34:56,069;Is that it?
505;00:34:56,104;00:34:58,105;I've never seen you
505;00:34:56,104;00:34:58,105;with a girl.
506;00:34:59,207;00:35:01,642;If I left you with
506;00:34:59,207;00:35:01,642;one of my bannermen,
507;00:35:01,676;00:35:04,712;your father would know
507;00:35:01,676;00:35:04,712;within a fortnight
508;00:35:04,746;00:35:08,216;and my bannerman would receive
508;00:35:04,746;00:35:08,216;a raven with a message:
509;00:35:08,250;00:35:11,819;Release my son and you'll be rich
509;00:35:08,250;00:35:11,819;beyond your dreams.
510;00:35:11,854;00:35:15,390;Refuse and your house
510;00:35:11,854;00:35:15,390;will be destroyed, root and stem.
511;00:35:15,424;00:35:17,725;You don't trust
511;00:35:15,424;00:35:17,725;the loyalty
512;00:35:17,760;00:35:20,061;of the men following
512;00:35:17,760;00:35:20,061;you into battle?
513;00:35:20,096;00:35:23,599;Oh, I trust them
513;00:35:20,096;00:35:23,599;with my life,
514;00:35:23,633;00:35:25,634;just not with yours.
515;00:35:25,668;00:35:27,502;Smart boy.
516;00:35:27,537;00:35:29,171;What's wrong?
517;00:35:29,205;00:35:31,172;Don't like
517;00:35:29,205;00:35:31,172;being called boy?
518;00:35:32,107;00:35:34,142;Insulted?
519;00:35:41,116;00:35:43,984;You insult yourself,
519;00:35:41,116;00:35:43,984;Kingslayer.
520;00:35:45,653;00:35:49,055;You've been defeated by a boy.
521;00:35:49,090;00:35:51,557;You're held captive
521;00:35:49,090;00:35:51,557;by a boy.
522;00:35:53,660;00:35:56,262;Perhaps you'll be
522;00:35:53,660;00:35:56,262;killed by a boy.
523;00:36:03,003;00:36:04,771;Stannis Baratheon
523;00:36:03,003;00:36:04,771;sent ravens
524;00:36:04,806;00:36:08,175;to all the high lords
524;00:36:04,806;00:36:08,175;of Westeros.
525;00:36:08,210;00:36:11,880;King Joffrey Baratheon
525;00:36:08,210;00:36:11,880;is neither a true king
526;00:36:11,914;00:36:14,549;nor a true Baratheon.
527;00:36:14,584;00:36:16,718;He's your bastard son.
528;00:36:16,753;00:36:19,322;If that's true,
528;00:36:16,753;00:36:19,322;Stannis is the rightful king.
529;00:36:19,356;00:36:21,390;How convenient for him.
530;00:36:21,424;00:36:25,694;My father learned
530;00:36:21,424;00:36:25,694;the truth.
531;00:36:25,729;00:36:27,396;That's why
531;00:36:25,729;00:36:27,396;you had him executed.
532;00:36:27,431;00:36:29,799;I was your prisoner
532;00:36:27,431;00:36:29,799;when Ned Stark lost his head.
533;00:36:29,833;00:36:31,935;Your son killed him
534;00:36:31,969;00:36:33,403;so the world wouldn't
534;00:36:31,969;00:36:33,403;learn who fathered him.
535;00:36:33,437;00:36:37,474;And you-- you pushed
535;00:36:33,437;00:36:37,474;my brother from a window
536;00:36:37,508;00:36:39,476;because he saw you
536;00:36:37,508;00:36:39,476;with the queen.
537;00:36:44,649;00:36:47,685;You have proof?
538;00:36:47,719;00:36:50,221;Or do you want to trade gossip
538;00:36:47,719;00:36:50,221;like a couple of fishwives?
539;00:36:50,256;00:36:52,424;I'm sending one of your cousins
539;00:36:50,256;00:36:52,424;down to King's Landing
540;00:36:52,459;00:36:54,093;with my peace terms.
541;00:36:54,127;00:36:57,163;You think my father's going
541;00:36:54,127;00:36:57,163;to negotiate with you?
542;00:36:57,197;00:36:59,599;You don't know him
542;00:36:57,197;00:36:59,599;very well.
543;00:36:59,633;00:37:04,003;No, but he's starting
543;00:36:59,633;00:37:04,003;to know me.
544;00:37:04,037;00:37:07,672;Three victories
544;00:37:04,037;00:37:07,672;don't make you a conqueror.
545;00:37:09,141;00:37:11,776;It's better than
545;00:37:09,141;00:37:11,776;three defeats.
546;00:37:40,208;00:37:42,809;This city stinks...
547;00:37:45,213;00:37:46,780;Like dead bodies.
548;00:37:46,814;00:37:48,948;A bit corpsey, yes.
549;00:37:48,982;00:37:51,450;And shit.
550;00:37:51,485;00:37:53,385;I thought you wanted
550;00:37:51,485;00:37:53,385;to come here.
551;00:37:56,722;00:37:59,090;I love it.
552;00:37:59,124;00:38:02,794;You love the smell
552;00:37:59,124;00:38:02,794;of dead bodies and shit?
553;00:38:02,828;00:38:05,864;And cum and garlic
553;00:38:02,828;00:38:05,864;and rum.
554;00:38:05,898;00:38:09,034;You can smell cum
554;00:38:05,898;00:38:09,034;from the balcony?
555;00:38:09,068;00:38:12,405;I love the stink.
555;00:38:09,068;00:38:12,405;I love the noise.
556;00:38:12,439;00:38:14,541;Cities make me
556;00:38:12,439;00:38:14,541;want to fuck.
557;00:38:14,575;00:38:17,878;And so did the country.
558;00:38:20,982;00:38:22,482;This is where I belong.
559;00:38:22,517;00:38:25,385;Yes, well, you need
559;00:38:22,517;00:38:25,385;to be careful.
560;00:38:25,419;00:38:26,986;No one can know
560;00:38:25,419;00:38:26,986;you're here.
561;00:38:27,021;00:38:28,688;No one will know.
562;00:38:28,722;00:38:30,289;You can't trust anyone
562;00:38:28,722;00:38:30,289;in King's Landing.
563;00:38:30,324;00:38:33,492;They're all liars--
563;00:38:30,324;00:38:33,492;good liars, bad liars,
564;00:38:33,527;00:38:35,961;one or two great liars.
565;00:38:35,995;00:38:37,996;What about you?
566;00:38:38,030;00:38:40,665;Me? I'm not from here.
566;00:38:38,030;00:38:40,665;I'm a slave to the truth.
567;00:38:40,699;00:38:43,501;Truth?
568;00:38:45,304;00:38:48,473;You are the biggest
568;00:38:45,304;00:38:48,473;little liar I have ever met.
569;00:38:48,507;00:38:50,508;Why do you think
569;00:38:48,507;00:38:50,508;I am so little?
570;00:38:50,542;00:38:55,078;I'm being crushed beneath the
570;00:38:50,542;00:38:55,078;weight of all that truth.
571;00:38:57,248;00:38:59,215;Oh!
572;00:38:59,250;00:39:02,052;Ned Stark actually
572;00:38:59,250;00:39:02,052;slept on this.
573;00:39:02,086;00:39:05,923;As if the poor man
573;00:39:02,086;00:39:05,923;didn't suffer enough.
574;00:39:07,726;00:39:11,196;One of the many changes
574;00:39:07,726;00:39:11,196;we'll have to make around here.
575;00:39:22,374;00:39:25,676;Lord Baelish.
575;00:39:22,374;00:39:25,676;Your Grace.
576;00:39:25,711;00:39:28,279;I wonder if I might
576;00:39:25,711;00:39:28,279;ask you for a favor.
577;00:39:28,313;00:39:29,814;Of course,
577;00:39:28,313;00:39:29,814;Your Grace.
578;00:39:29,848;00:39:31,782;Ned Stark's youngest
578;00:39:29,848;00:39:31,782;daughter Arya--
579;00:39:31,817;00:39:34,018;we can't seem
579;00:39:31,817;00:39:34,018;to locate her.
580;00:39:34,052;00:39:36,553;If she's escaped
580;00:39:34,052;00:39:36,553;the capital,
581;00:39:36,588;00:39:38,655;Winterfell seems
581;00:39:36,588;00:39:38,655;the logical destination.
582;00:39:38,689;00:39:41,225;And yet my friends in the North
582;00:39:38,689;00:39:41,225;report no sign of her.
583;00:39:41,259;00:39:43,193;Curious.
584;00:39:43,228;00:39:45,362;If we choose to negotiate
584;00:39:43,228;00:39:45,362;with the Starks,
585;00:39:45,397;00:39:47,665;the girl has some value.
585;00:39:45,397;00:39:47,665;Whoever finds her--
586;00:39:47,699;00:39:50,234;well, you know what they say about
586;00:39:47,699;00:39:50,234;Lannisters and debts.
587;00:39:50,269;00:39:52,270;Well, you could ask
587;00:39:50,269;00:39:52,270;Varys where she is.
588;00:39:52,305;00:39:54,606;He'll have
588;00:39:52,305;00:39:54,606;an answer for you.
589;00:39:54,641;00:39:56,208;Whether you believe it...
590;00:39:56,242;00:40:00,113;Myself, I have always had
590;00:39:56,242;00:40:00,113;a hard time trusting eunuchs.
591;00:40:00,147;00:40:02,782;Who knows what they want?
592;00:40:02,816;00:40:05,918;A mockingbird.
593;00:40:05,953;00:40:07,712;You created your
593;00:40:05,953;00:40:07,712;own Sigil, didn't you?
594;00:40:07,737;00:40:08,937;Yes.
595;00:40:09,489;00:40:11,791;Appropriate...
595;00:40:09,489;00:40:11,791;for a self-made man
596;00:40:11,825;00:40:13,559;with so many
596;00:40:11,825;00:40:13,559;songs to sing.
597;00:40:13,593;00:40:15,227;I'm glad you like it.
598;00:40:15,262;00:40:17,130;Some people are
598;00:40:15,262;00:40:17,130;fortunate enough
599;00:40:17,164;00:40:18,797;to be born into
599;00:40:17,164;00:40:18,797;the right family.
600;00:40:18,832;00:40:21,500;Others have to find
600;00:40:18,832;00:40:21,500;their own way.
601;00:40:22,869;00:40:24,903;I heard a song once
602;00:40:24,937;00:40:27,572;about a boy
602;00:40:24,937;00:40:27,572;of modest means
603;00:40:27,606;00:40:31,342;who found his way into the
603;00:40:27,606;00:40:31,342;home of a very prominent family.
604;00:40:31,376;00:40:33,144;He loved
604;00:40:31,376;00:40:33,144;the eldest daughter.
605;00:40:33,178;00:40:36,581;Sadly, she had eyes
605;00:40:33,178;00:40:36,581;for another.
606;00:40:36,615;00:40:38,983;When boys and girls
606;00:40:36,615;00:40:38,983;live in the same home,
607;00:40:39,017;00:40:41,652;awkward situations
607;00:40:39,017;00:40:41,652;can arise.
608;00:40:41,686;00:40:44,321;Sometimes, I've heard,
608;00:40:41,686;00:40:44,321;even brothers and sisters
609;00:40:44,355;00:40:46,856;develop
609;00:40:44,355;00:40:46,856;certain affections.
610;00:40:46,891;00:40:49,325;And when these affections
610;00:40:46,891;00:40:49,325;become common knowledge,
611;00:40:49,359;00:40:53,228;well, that is an awkward
611;00:40:49,359;00:40:53,228;situation indeed,
612;00:40:53,263;00:40:55,564;especially
612;00:40:53,263;00:40:55,564;in a prominent family.
613;00:40:55,598;00:40:59,034;But prominent families
613;00:40:55,598;00:40:59,034;often forget a simple truth,
614;00:40:59,068;00:41:01,303;I've found.
615;00:41:01,337;00:41:03,472;And which truth is that?
616;00:41:03,506;00:41:07,143;Knowledge is power.
617;00:41:09,313;00:41:11,715;Seize him.
618;00:41:13,551;00:41:15,553;Cut his throat.
619;00:41:16,688;00:41:19,157;Stop. Wait.
620;00:41:19,191;00:41:21,560;I've changed my mind.
620;00:41:19,191;00:41:21,560;Let him go.
621;00:41:24,497;00:41:26,197;Step back three paces.
622;00:41:27,600;00:41:30,001;Turn around.
623;00:41:30,035;00:41:31,702;Close your eyes.
624;00:41:35,908;00:41:38,343;Power is power.
625;00:41:40,078;00:41:41,565;Do see if you can
625;00:41:40,078;00:41:41,565;take some time away from
626;00:41:41,590;00:41:43,504;your coins and your whores
627;00:41:43,849;00:41:45,650;to locate
627;00:41:43,849;00:41:45,650;the Stark girl for me.
628;00:41:45,684;00:41:49,220;I would very much
628;00:41:45,684;00:41:49,220;appreciate it.
629;00:41:59,031;00:42:01,232;You're Ser Alton Lannister?
630;00:42:01,266;00:42:03,835;I am, Your Grace.
631;00:42:03,869;00:42:07,406;I offer your cousins peace
631;00:42:03,869;00:42:07,406;if they meet my terms.
632;00:42:07,440;00:42:11,743;First, your family
632;00:42:07,440;00:42:11,743;must release my sisters.
633;00:42:11,778;00:42:15,446;Second, my father's bones
633;00:42:11,778;00:42:15,446;must be returned to us
634;00:42:15,480;00:42:17,414;so he may rest beside
634;00:42:15,480;00:42:17,414;his brother and sister
635;00:42:17,449;00:42:20,184;in the crypts
635;00:42:17,449;00:42:20,184;beneath Winterfell.
636;00:42:20,218;00:42:22,387;And the remains of all those
636;00:42:20,218;00:42:22,387;who died in his service
637;00:42:22,421;00:42:24,622;must also be returned.
638;00:42:24,657;00:42:27,159;Their families can honor
638;00:42:24,657;00:42:27,159;them with proper funerals.
639;00:42:27,194;00:42:30,262;An honorable request, Your Grace.
639;00:42:27,194;00:42:30,262;Third...
640;00:42:31,932;00:42:34,401;Joffrey and the Queen Regent
640;00:42:31,932;00:42:34,401;must renounce all claim
641;00:42:34,435;00:42:37,037;to dominion of the North.
642;00:42:37,072;00:42:39,273;From this time
642;00:42:37,072;00:42:39,273;till the end of time,
643;00:42:39,308;00:42:41,842;we are a free
643;00:42:39,308;00:42:41,842;and independent kingdom.
644;00:42:41,877;00:42:43,844;The King in the North.
645;00:42:43,879;00:42:46,346;King in the North.
646;00:42:46,381;00:42:47,948;Neither Joffrey
646;00:42:46,381;00:42:47,948;nor any of his men
647;00:42:47,983;00:42:50,217;shall set foot
647;00:42:47,983;00:42:50,217;in our lands again.
648;00:42:50,285;00:42:52,152;If he disregards
648;00:42:50,285;00:42:52,152;this command,
649;00:42:52,187;00:42:55,723;he shall suffer
649;00:42:52,187;00:42:55,723;the same fate as my father,
650;00:42:55,757;00:43:00,060;only I don't need a servant
650;00:42:55,757;00:43:00,060;to do my beheading for me.
651;00:43:00,094;00:43:03,597;These are-- Your Grace,
651;00:43:00,094;00:43:03,597;these are--
652;00:43:03,631;00:43:06,166;these are my terms.
653;00:43:06,200;00:43:09,336;If the Queen Regent and her son
653;00:43:06,200;00:43:09,336;meet them, I'll give them peace.
654;00:43:09,370;00:43:12,339;If not...
655;00:43:12,373;00:43:14,808;I will litter the south
655;00:43:12,373;00:43:14,808;with Lannister dead.
656;00:43:14,843;00:43:17,745;King Joffrey is a Baratheon,
656;00:43:14,843;00:43:17,745;Your Grace.
657;00:43:17,779;00:43:19,580;Oh, is he?
658;00:43:20,783;00:43:24,118;You'll ride at daybreak,
658;00:43:20,783;00:43:24,118;Ser Alton.
659;00:43:24,153;00:43:26,787;That will be all
659;00:43:24,153;00:43:26,787;for tonight.
660;00:43:41,536;00:43:43,671;A word, Your Grace?
661;00:43:45,440;00:43:48,175;You don't have to call me
661;00:43:45,440;00:43:48,175;Your Grace when no one's around.
662;00:43:48,209;00:43:50,912;It's not so bad
662;00:43:48,209;00:43:50,912;once you get used to it.
663;00:43:50,946;00:43:52,780;I'm glad someone's
663;00:43:50,946;00:43:52,780;gotten used to it.
664;00:43:52,814;00:43:56,150;The Lannisters are going to reject
664;00:43:52,814;00:43:56,150;your terms, you know?
665;00:43:56,184;00:43:57,885;Of course they are.
666;00:43:57,919;00:44:00,254;We can fight them
666;00:43:57,919;00:44:00,254;in the fields as long as you like,
667;00:44:00,288;00:44:03,991;but we won't beat them until you
667;00:44:00,288;00:44:03,991;take King's Landing.
668;00:44:05,527;00:44:08,663;And we can't take
668;00:44:05,527;00:44:08,663;King's Landing without ships.
669;00:44:08,697;00:44:11,332;My father has ships and men
669;00:44:08,697;00:44:11,332;who know how to sail them.
670;00:44:11,367;00:44:13,134;Men who fought
670;00:44:11,367;00:44:13,134;my father.
671;00:44:13,169;00:44:15,603;Men who fought King Robert
671;00:44:13,169;00:44:15,603;to free themselves
672;00:44:15,637;00:44:19,441;from the yoke of the South,
672;00:44:15,637;00:44:19,441;just like you're doing now.
673;00:44:20,609;00:44:23,679;I'm his only living son.
674;00:44:23,713;00:44:26,849;He'll listen to me.
674;00:44:23,713;00:44:26,849;I know he will.
675;00:44:29,285;00:44:32,554;I'm not a Stark.
675;00:44:29,285;00:44:32,554;I know that.
676;00:44:32,589;00:44:35,558;But your father raised me
676;00:44:32,589;00:44:35,558;to be an honorable man.
677;00:44:37,327;00:44:39,829;We can avenge him
677;00:44:37,327;00:44:39,829;together.
678;00:44:41,131;00:44:44,100;You don't want
678;00:44:41,131;00:44:44,100;Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
679;00:44:44,134;00:44:46,402;I need his ships.
679;00:44:44,134;00:44:46,402;They say he has 200.
680;00:44:46,437;00:44:50,006;They say a million rats
680;00:44:46,437;00:44:50,006;live in the sewers of King's Landing.
681;00:44:50,040;00:44:51,975;Shall we rally them
681;00:44:50,040;00:44:51,975;to fight for us?
682;00:44:52,009;00:44:53,843;I understand you don't
682;00:44:52,009;00:44:53,843;trust Lord Greyjoy.
683;00:44:53,878;00:44:58,548;I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because
683;00:44:53,878;00:44:58,548;he is not trustworthy.
684;00:44:58,582;00:45:01,217;Your father had to go to war
684;00:44:58,582;00:45:01,217;to end his rebellion.
685;00:45:01,252;00:45:05,122;Yes. And now I'm the one
685;00:45:01,252;00:45:05,122;rebelling against the throne.
686;00:45:05,156;00:45:07,424;Before me, it was father.
687;00:45:07,458;00:45:09,125;You married one rebel
687;00:45:07,458;00:45:09,125;and mothered another.
688;00:45:09,159;00:45:12,162;I mothered more than
688;00:45:09,159;00:45:12,162;just rebels,
689;00:45:12,196;00:45:14,530;a fact you seem
689;00:45:12,196;00:45:14,530;to have forgotten.
690;00:45:14,565;00:45:16,566;If I trade the Kingslayer
690;00:45:14,565;00:45:16,566;for two girls,
691;00:45:16,600;00:45:18,867;my bannermen will string me up
691;00:45:16,600;00:45:18,867;by my feet.
692;00:45:18,902;00:45:22,071;You want to leave Sansa
692;00:45:18,902;00:45:22,071;in the Queen's hands?
693;00:45:22,105;00:45:24,173;And Arya--
694;00:45:24,207;00:45:27,209;I haven't heard
694;00:45:24,207;00:45:27,209;a word about Arya.
695;00:45:27,244;00:45:28,978;What are we fighting for
695;00:45:27,244;00:45:28,978;if not for them?
696;00:45:29,012;00:45:30,613;It's more complicated
696;00:45:29,012;00:45:30,613;than that!
697;00:45:30,647;00:45:32,782;You know it is.
698;00:45:47,232;00:45:50,835;It's time for me
698;00:45:47,232;00:45:50,835;to go home.
699;00:45:50,869;00:45:53,771;I haven't seen Bran
699;00:45:50,869;00:45:53,771;or Rickon in months.
700;00:45:54,740;00:45:57,442;You can't go
700;00:45:54,740;00:45:57,442;to Winterfell.
701;00:45:57,476;00:45:59,444;I beg your pardon?
702;00:45:59,478;00:46:02,613;I'll send Rodrik
702;00:45:59,478;00:46:02,613;to watch over the boys
703;00:46:02,648;00:46:07,184;because tomorrow
703;00:46:02,648;00:46:07,184;you'll ride south to the Stormlands.
704;00:46:07,218;00:46:09,219;Why in the name
704;00:46:07,218;00:46:09,219;of all the Gods--
705;00:46:09,253;00:46:13,156;because I need you to negotiate
705;00:46:09,253;00:46:13,156;with Renly Baratheon.
706;00:46:13,191;00:46:15,325;He's rallied
706;00:46:13,191;00:46:15,325;an army of 100,000.
707;00:46:15,360;00:46:17,094;You know him.
707;00:46:15,360;00:46:17,094;You know his family.
708;00:46:17,128;00:46:19,562;I haven't seen Renly Baratheon
708;00:46:17,128;00:46:19,562;since he was a boy.
709;00:46:19,597;00:46:21,131;You have a hundred
709;00:46:19,597;00:46:21,131;other lords--
710;00:46:21,165;00:46:25,035;Which of these lords
710;00:46:21,165;00:46:25,035;do I trust more than you?
711;00:46:25,069;00:46:27,871;If Renly sides with us,
712;00:46:27,906;00:46:30,340;we'll outnumber them
712;00:46:27,906;00:46:30,340;two to one.
713;00:46:30,374;00:46:33,310;When they feel the jaws beginning
713;00:46:30,374;00:46:33,310;to shut, they'll sue for peace.
714;00:46:33,344;00:46:36,079;We'll get the girls back.
715;00:46:36,113;00:46:39,616;Then we'll all
715;00:46:36,113;00:46:39,616;go home... for good.
716;00:46:46,724;00:46:49,693;I will ride at first light.
717;00:46:58,336;00:47:01,938;We will all be together
717;00:46:58,336;00:47:01,938;again soon, I promise.
718;00:47:06,944;00:47:09,545;You've done so well.
719;00:47:10,848;00:47:14,717;Your father
719;00:47:10,848;00:47:14,717;would be... proud.
720;00:47:22,460;00:47:25,462;Give Lord Renly my regards.
720;00:47:22,460;00:47:25,462;King Renly.
721;00:47:26,798;00:47:29,567;There's a king
721;00:47:26,798;00:47:29,567;in every corner now.
722;00:47:42,514;00:47:45,048;What is all this?
723;00:47:45,083;00:47:47,351;Returning this room
723;00:47:45,083;00:47:47,351;to its proper appearance.
724;00:47:47,385;00:47:50,253;Say what you will about the Targaryens--
724;00:47:47,385;00:47:50,253;they were conquerors.
725;00:47:50,288;00:47:53,123;That is a seat
725;00:47:50,288;00:47:53,123;for a conqueror.
726;00:47:53,157;00:47:56,826;It needs a room to match it,
726;00:47:53,157;00:47:56,826;not vines and flowers.
727;00:47:56,860;00:47:59,228;We can't find Arya Stark.
728;00:47:59,263;00:48:01,397;With luck, she's dead
728;00:47:59,263;00:48:01,397;in a ditch somewhere.
729;00:48:01,431;00:48:03,399;Perhaps. But if not,
729;00:48:01,431;00:48:03,399;we need her.
730;00:48:03,433;00:48:05,768;They'll never give Jaime back
730;00:48:03,433;00:48:05,768;to us for Sansa alone.
731;00:48:05,803;00:48:08,404;I think they might.
731;00:48:05,803;00:48:08,404;They're weak.
732;00:48:08,439;00:48:10,273;They put too much value
732;00:48:08,439;00:48:10,273;on their women.
733;00:48:10,307;00:48:14,143;We need to set our armies
733;00:48:10,307;00:48:14,143;to the task of finding her.
734;00:48:14,178;00:48:16,045;Send out as many men
734;00:48:14,178;00:48:16,045;as we can.
735;00:48:16,080;00:48:17,881;I'm sure if you asked
735;00:48:16,080;00:48:17,881;grandfather--
736;00:48:17,915;00:48:21,918;"The King does not ask;"
736;00:48:17,915;00:48:21,918;He commands.
737;00:48:21,952;00:48:24,821;And my grandfather's
737;00:48:21,952;00:48:24,821;stupidity in the field of battle
738;00:48:24,855;00:48:27,757;is the reason Robb Stark has
738;00:48:24,855;00:48:27,757;Uncle Jaime in the first place.
739;00:48:27,791;00:48:30,492;His life is in danger.
740;00:48:30,527;00:48:32,161;We're at war.
741;00:48:32,195;00:48:35,296;All our lives
741;00:48:32,195;00:48:35,296;are in danger.
742;00:48:38,300;00:48:41,803;I heard a disgusting lie
742;00:48:38,300;00:48:41,803;about Uncle Jaime.
743;00:48:41,837;00:48:43,471;And you.
744;00:48:44,640;00:48:46,141;Our enemies
744;00:48:44,640;00:48:46,141;will say anything
745;00:48:46,175;00:48:48,176;to weaken your claim
745;00:48:46,175;00:48:48,176;to the throne.
746;00:48:48,211;00:48:50,346;It's not a claim.
746;00:48:48,211;00:48:50,346;The throne is mine.
747;00:48:51,648;00:48:53,750;Of course it is.
748;00:48:55,720;00:48:57,621;No one believes
748;00:48:55,720;00:48:57,621;this foul gossip.
749;00:48:57,655;00:48:59,790;Someone believes it.
750;00:49:01,126;00:49:03,760;Father had
750;00:49:01,126;00:49:03,760;other children?
751;00:49:03,795;00:49:06,330;Besides me and Tommen
751;00:49:03,795;00:49:06,330;and Myrcella?
752;00:49:08,133;00:49:10,100;What are you asking?
753;00:49:10,134;00:49:12,536;I'm asking if he fucked
753;00:49:10,134;00:49:12,536;other women
754;00:49:12,571;00:49:14,105;when he grew tired
754;00:49:12,571;00:49:14,105;of you.
755;00:49:14,139;00:49:15,940;How many bastards
755;00:49:14,139;00:49:15,940;does he have running--
756;00:49:31,689;00:49:35,925;What you just did
756;00:49:31,689;00:49:35,925;is punishable by death.
757;00:49:39,362;00:49:42,064;You will never
757;00:49:39,362;00:49:42,064;do it again.
758;00:49:42,132;00:49:44,033;Never.
759;00:49:50,073;00:49:52,174;That will be all,
759;00:49:50,073;00:49:52,174;Mother.
760;00:49:58,782;00:50:00,883;No, no, no, no.
761;00:50:00,918;00:50:03,720;Do you have any idea
761;00:50:00,918;00:50:03,720;how ridiculous you sound?
762;00:50:03,754;00:50:05,222;Ease into it.
763;00:50:05,256;00:50:08,258;Slowly, with passion.
764;00:50:08,292;00:50:12,029;Oh, yeah.
765;00:50:12,064;00:50:15,933;Go wash yourselves.
765;00:50:12,064;00:50:15,933;Put some clothes on.
766;00:50:15,968;00:50:18,570;Both of you
766;00:50:15,968;00:50:18,570;are working tonight.
767;00:50:22,340;00:50:24,308;We do things
767;00:50:22,340;00:50:24,308;differently here, Daisy.
768;00:50:24,342;00:50:28,311;This isn't some five-copper
768;00:50:24,342;00:50:28,311;bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.
769;00:50:28,345;00:50:30,846;Haystack Hall.
769;00:50:28,345;00:50:30,846;Wherever you're from.
770;00:50:30,881;00:50:32,715;Our establishment
770;00:50:30,881;00:50:32,715;doesn't cater
771;00:50:32,749;00:50:35,517;to ploughmen
771;00:50:32,749;00:50:35,517;and goat herders.
772;00:50:35,551;00:50:37,652;Lord Olsen.

775;00:50:41,323;00:50:43,091;Littlefinger.
776;00:50:43,126;00:50:44,559;He doesn't like it.

779;00:50:54,872;00:50:57,440;so that people
779;00:50:54,872;00:50:57,440;will think she's exotic.
780;00:50:57,475;00:51:00,377;She grew up just down the road
780;00:50:57,475;00:51:00,377;in flea bottom.
781;00:51:00,412;00:51:02,980;She's beautiful.
