2;00:03:56,000;00:03:57,072;The bastard of Winterfell.
3;00:03:58,068;00:04:00,089;The dwarf of Casterly Rock.
4;00:04:06,014;00:04:08,027;I believe we last saw
4;00:04:06,014;00:04:08,027;each other atop the Wall.
5;00:04:08,027;00:04:12,018;You were pissing off the edge
5;00:04:08,027;00:04:12,018;if I remember right.
6;00:04:12,018;00:04:14,064;Picked up some scars
6;00:04:12,018;00:04:14,064;along the road.
7;00:04:14,064;00:04:19,014;It's been a long road,
7;00:04:14,064;00:04:19,014;but we're both still here.
8;00:04:21,014;00:04:22,064;I'm Tyrion Lannister.
9;00:04:22,064;00:04:26,047;Davos Seaworth.
9;00:04:22,064;00:04:26,047;Ah, the Onion Knight.
10;00:04:26,048;00:04:29,056;We fought on opposite sides at
10;00:04:26,048;00:04:29,056;the Battle of Blackwater Bay.
11;00:04:29,056;00:04:32,014;Unluckily for me.
12;00:04:32,014;00:04:35,018;Missandei is the queen's
12;00:04:32,014;00:04:35,018;most trusted advisor.
13;00:04:36,085;00:04:38,056;Welcome to Dragonstone.
14;00:04:38,056;00:04:40,039;Our queen knows
14;00:04:38,056;00:04:40,039;it is a long journey.
15;00:04:40,039;00:04:43,077;She appreciates the efforts
15;00:04:40,039;00:04:43,077;you have made on her behalf.
16;00:04:43,077;00:04:46,052;If you wouldn't mind
16;00:04:43,077;00:04:46,052;handing over your weapons.
17;00:04:52,014;00:04:53,052;Of course.
18;00:05:18,014;00:05:19,068;Please, this way.
19;00:05:24,039;00:05:26,002;Where are you from?
20;00:05:26,002;00:05:28,031;I can't place the accent.
21;00:05:28,031;00:05:30,014;I was born on
21;00:05:28,031;00:05:30,014;the Island of Naath.
22;00:05:30,014;00:05:33,023;Ah. I hear it's
22;00:05:30,014;00:05:33,023;beautiful down there.
23;00:05:33,023;00:05:35,031;Palm trees and butterflies.
24;00:05:35,031;00:05:36,073;Haven't been, myself.
25;00:05:40,089;00:05:42,068;This place has changed.
26;00:05:49,006;00:05:52,018;And Sansa? I hear
26;00:05:49,006;00:05:52,018;she's alive and well.
27;00:05:52,018;00:05:54,068;She is.
27;00:05:52,018;00:05:54,068;Does she miss me terribly?
28;00:05:57,085;00:06:00,027;A sham marriage.
28;00:05:57,085;00:06:00,027;And unconsummated.
29;00:06:00,027;00:06:03,043;I didn't ask.
29;00:06:00,027;00:06:03,043;Well, it was. Wasn't.
30;00:06:03,043;00:06:05,035;Anyway...
31;00:06:05,035;00:06:08,018;she's much smarter
31;00:06:05,035;00:06:08,018;than she lets on.
32;00:06:08,018;00:06:10,056;She's starting to let on.
33;00:06:10,056;00:06:11,048;Good.
34;00:06:11,048;00:06:13,052;At some point,
35;00:06:13,052;00:06:17,047;I want to hear how a Night's Watch
35;00:06:13,052;00:06:17,047;recruit became King in the North.
36;00:06:17,048;00:06:19,027;As long as you tell me
36;00:06:17,048;00:06:19,027;how a Lannister
37;00:06:19,027;00:06:22,006;became Hand
37;00:06:19,027;00:06:22,006;to Daenerys Targaryen.
38;00:06:22,006;00:06:24,018;A long and bloody tale.
39;00:06:24,018;00:06:26,093;To be honest,
39;00:06:24,018;00:06:26,093;I was drunk for most of it.
40;00:06:29,056;00:06:32,010;My bannermen think
40;00:06:29,056;00:06:32,010;I'm a fool for coming here.
41;00:06:32,010;00:06:33,052;Of course they do.
42;00:06:33,052;00:06:36,023;If I was your Hand, I would
42;00:06:33,052;00:06:36,023;have advised against it.
43;00:06:38,085;00:06:40,077;General rule of thumb--
44;00:06:40,077;00:06:43,089;Stark men don't fare well
44;00:06:40,077;00:06:43,089;when they travel south.
45;00:06:43,089;00:06:45,064;True...
46;00:06:45,064;00:06:47,077;but I'm not a Stark.
47;00:07:02,002;00:07:03,027;I'd say you get used to them...
48;00:07:06,002;00:07:07,048;but you never really do.
49;00:07:11,002;00:07:14,027;Come, their mother
49;00:07:11,002;00:07:14,027;is waiting for you.
50;00:07:26,064;00:07:30,023;I wondered why you weren't
50;00:07:26,064;00:07:30,023;there to meet our guests.
51;00:07:30,023;00:07:33,023;You begged us to summon
51;00:07:30,023;00:07:33,023;the King in the North.
52;00:07:33,023;00:07:35,068;Don't you want to see him again?
53;00:07:35,068;00:07:38,031;I've done my part.
54;00:07:38,031;00:07:40,072;I've brought
54;00:07:38,031;00:07:40,072;ice and fire together.
55;00:07:40,073;00:07:43,002;Strange.
56;00:07:43,002;00:07:45,052;You spoke so highly of Jon Snow,
57;00:07:45,052;00:07:49,018;but when he arrives,
57;00:07:45,052;00:07:49,018;you hide on a cliff.
58;00:07:49,018;00:07:51,056;I didn't take you
58;00:07:49,018;00:07:51,056;for a bashful girl.
59;00:07:51,056;00:07:55,077;My time whispering in the ears
59;00:07:51,056;00:07:55,077;of kings has come to an end.
60;00:07:55,077;00:07:58,018;Oh, I doubt that.
61;00:07:58,018;00:08:00,081;Give us common folk
61;00:07:58,018;00:08:00,081;one taste of power,
62;00:08:00,081;00:08:03,064;we're like the lion
62;00:08:00,081;00:08:03,064;who tasted man.
63;00:08:03,064;00:08:06,089;Nothing is ever so sweet again.
64;00:08:06,089;00:08:10,014;Neither of us
64;00:08:06,089;00:08:10,014;is common folk anymore.
65;00:08:12,027;00:08:14,006;I did not part on good terms
66;00:08:14,006;00:08:17,006;with the King in the North
66;00:08:14,006;00:08:17,006;or his advisor.
67;00:08:17,006;00:08:18,006;Why?
68;00:08:19,073;00:08:21,077;Because of mistakes I made.
69;00:08:23,089;00:08:25,077;Terrible mistakes.
70;00:08:27,060;00:08:30,072;I would only be
70;00:08:27,060;00:08:30,072;a distraction if I stayed.
71;00:08:30,073;00:08:32,093;So, where will you go?
71;00:08:30,073;00:08:32,093;Volantis.
72;00:08:32,093;00:08:34,093;Good.
73;00:08:34,093;00:08:37,018;If you don't mind my saying,
74;00:08:37,018;00:08:40,093;I don't think you should
74;00:08:37,018;00:08:40,093;return to Westeros.
75;00:08:40,093;00:08:43,039;I'm not sure you'd be safe here.
76;00:08:45,031;00:08:48,052;Oh, I will return, dear Spider.
77;00:08:48,052;00:08:50,031;One last time.
77;00:08:48,052;00:08:50,031;My lady--
78;00:08:50,031;00:08:53,089;I have to die
78;00:08:50,031;00:08:53,089;in this strange country.
79;00:08:53,089;00:08:55,073;Just like you.
80;00:09:37,098;00:09:39,060;You stand in the presence
81;00:09:39,060;00:09:42,039;of Daenerys Stormborn
81;00:09:39,060;00:09:42,039;of House Targaryen,
82;00:09:42,039;00:09:44,060;rightful heir
82;00:09:42,039;00:09:44,060;to the Iron Throne,
83;00:09:44,060;00:09:47,056;rightful Queen of the Andals
83;00:09:44,060;00:09:47,056;and the First Men,
84;00:09:47,056;00:09:49,098;Protector of the Seven Kingdoms,
85;00:09:49,098;00:09:51,068;the Mother of Dragons,
86;00:09:51,068;00:09:53,089;the Khaleesi
86;00:09:51,068;00:09:53,089;of the Great Grass Sea,
87;00:09:53,089;00:09:57,068;the Unburnt,
87;00:09:53,089;00:09:57,068;the Breaker of Chains.
88;00:10:02,081;00:10:04,048;This is Jon Snow.
89;00:10:08,048;00:10:10,027;He's King in the North.
90;00:10:12,098;00:10:15,014;Thank you for traveling
90;00:10:12,098;00:10:15,014;so far, my lord.
91;00:10:15,014;00:10:17,039;I hope the seas
91;00:10:15,014;00:10:17,039;weren't too rough.
92;00:10:17,039;00:10:18,098;The winds were kind, Your Grace.
93;00:10:18,098;00:10:22,098;Apologies, I have a Flea
93;00:10:18,098;00:10:22,098;Bottom accent, I know,
94;00:10:22,098;00:10:25,085;but Jon Snow is King in
94;00:10:22,098;00:10:25,085;the North, Your Grace.
95;00:10:25,085;00:10:27,068;He's not a lord.
95;00:10:25,085;00:10:27,068;Forgive me--
96;00:10:27,068;00:10:29,093;Your Grace, this is
96;00:10:27,068;00:10:29,093;Ser Davos Seaworth.
97;00:10:29,093;00:10:31,085;Forgive me, Ser Davos.
98;00:10:31,085;00:10:34,047;I never did receive
98;00:10:31,085;00:10:34,047;a formal education,
99;00:10:34,048;00:10:35,081;but I could have sworn I read
100;00:10:35,081;00:10:39,010;the last King in the
100;00:10:35,081;00:10:39,010;North was Torrhen Stark,
101;00:10:39,010;00:10:42,027;who bent the knee to my
101;00:10:39,010;00:10:42,027;ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.
102;00:10:42,027;00:10:45,047;In exchange for his life
102;00:10:42,027;00:10:45,047;and the lives of the Northmen,
103;00:10:45,048;00:10:50,052;Torrhen Stark swore fealty to
103;00:10:45,048;00:10:50,052;House Targaryen in perpetuity.
104;00:10:50,052;00:10:52,002;Or do I have my facts wrong?
105;00:10:52,002;00:10:54,035;I wasn't there, Your Grace.
106;00:10:54,035;00:10:56,077;No, of course not.
107;00:10:56,077;00:10:59,035;But still, an oath is an oath.
108;00:10:59,035;00:11:01,077;And perpetuity means--
109;00:11:01,077;00:11:04,023;what does perpetuity mean,
109;00:11:01,077;00:11:04,023;Lord Tyrion?
110;00:11:04,023;00:11:05,072;Forever.
111;00:11:05,073;00:11:07,081;Forever.
112;00:11:07,081;00:11:10,064;So I assume, my lord...
113;00:11:10,064;00:11:12,085;...you're here
113;00:11:10,064;00:11:12,085;to bend the knee.
114;00:11:15,039;00:11:16,093;I am not.
115;00:11:18,056;00:11:20,006;Oh.
116;00:11:20,006;00:11:21,089;Well, that is unfortunate.
117;00:11:23,023;00:11:24,089;You've traveled all this way
118;00:11:24,089;00:11:27,006;to break faith
118;00:11:24,089;00:11:27,006;with House Targaryen?
119;00:11:27,006;00:11:29,056;Break faith?
120;00:11:29,056;00:11:31,089;Your father burned
120;00:11:29,056;00:11:31,089;my grandfather alive.
121;00:11:31,089;00:11:33,060;He burned my uncle alive.
122;00:11:33,060;00:11:34,093;He would have burned
122;00:11:33,060;00:11:34,093;the Seven Kingdoms--
123;00:11:34,093;00:11:38,002;My father...
123;00:11:34,093;00:11:38,002;was an evil man.
124;00:11:39,085;00:11:42,006;On behalf of House Targaryen...
125;00:11:43,031;00:11:44,093;I ask your forgiveness
126;00:11:44,093;00:11:47,089;for the crimes he committed
126;00:11:44,093;00:11:47,089;against your family.
127;00:11:47,089;00:11:50,077;And I ask you
127;00:11:47,089;00:11:50,077;not to judge a daughter
128;00:11:50,077;00:11:53,014;by the sins of her father.
129;00:11:54,060;00:11:58,010;Our two houses
129;00:11:54,060;00:11:58,010;were allies for centuries,
130;00:11:58,010;00:11:59,098;and those were
130;00:11:58,010;00:11:59,098;the best centuries
131;00:11:59,098;00:12:02,010;the Seven Kingdoms
131;00:11:59,098;00:12:02,010;have ever known.
132;00:12:02,010;00:12:04,060;Centuries of peace
132;00:12:02,010;00:12:04,060;and prosperity
133;00:12:04,060;00:12:07,043;with a Targaryen
133;00:12:04,060;00:12:07,043;sitting on the Iron Throne
134;00:12:07,043;00:12:11,043;and a Stark serving
134;00:12:07,043;00:12:11,043;as Warden of the North.
135;00:12:11,043;00:12:15,018;I am the last Targaryen,
135;00:12:11,043;00:12:15,018;Jon Snow.
136;00:12:15,018;00:12:17,060;Honor the pledge
136;00:12:15,018;00:12:17,060;your ancestor made to mine.
137;00:12:17,060;00:12:21,027;Bend the knee and I will name
137;00:12:17,060;00:12:21,027;you Warden of the North.
138;00:12:21,027;00:12:23,047;Together, we will
138;00:12:21,027;00:12:23,047;save this country
139;00:12:23,048;00:12:26,010;from those who would destroy it.
140;00:12:35,093;00:12:37,098;You're right.
141;00:12:37,098;00:12:40,047;You're not guilty
141;00:12:37,098;00:12:40,047;of your father's crimes.
142;00:12:40,048;00:12:45,031;And I'm not beholden
142;00:12:40,048;00:12:45,031;to my ancestor's vows.
143;00:12:45,031;00:12:47,031;Then why are you here?
144;00:12:47,031;00:12:50,014;Because I need your help,
144;00:12:47,031;00:12:50,014;and you need mine.
145;00:12:53,035;00:12:55,031;Did you see three dragons
146;00:12:55,031;00:12:57,027;flying overhead
146;00:12:55,031;00:12:57,027;when you arrived?
147;00:12:57,027;00:12:58,035;I did.
148;00:12:58,035;00:13:00,064;And did you see the Dothraki,
149;00:13:00,064;00:13:02,085;all of whom have sworn
149;00:13:00,064;00:13:02,085;to kill for me?
150;00:13:02,085;00:13:04,081;They're hard to miss.
151;00:13:04,081;00:13:08,085;But still, I need your help?
151;00:13:04,081;00:13:08,085;Not to defeat Cersei.
152;00:13:08,085;00:13:12,018;You could storm King's Landing
152;00:13:08,085;00:13:12,018;tomorrow and the city would fall.
153;00:13:12,018;00:13:14,043;Hell, we almost took it and
153;00:13:12,018;00:13:14,043;we didn't even have dragons.
154;00:13:14,043;00:13:18,056;Almost.
154;00:13:14,043;00:13:18,056;But you haven't stormed King's Landing.
155;00:13:18,056;00:13:20,018;Why not?
156;00:13:20,018;00:13:21,089;The only reason I can see
157;00:13:21,089;00:13:24,014;is you don't want to kill
157;00:13:21,089;00:13:24,014;thousands of innocent people.
158;00:13:24,014;00:13:26,018;It's the fastest way
158;00:13:24,014;00:13:26,018;to win the war,
159;00:13:26,018;00:13:28,002;but you won't do it,
160;00:13:28,002;00:13:31,023;which means, at the very least,
161;00:13:31,023;00:13:32,068;you're better than Cersei.
162;00:13:34,018;00:13:37,056;Still, that doesn't explain
162;00:13:34,018;00:13:37,056;why I need your help.
163;00:13:39,043;00:13:44,006;Because right now, you and I
163;00:13:39,043;00:13:44,006;and Cersei and everyone else,
164;00:13:44,006;00:13:45,068;we're children
164;00:13:44,006;00:13:45,068;playing at a game,
165;00:13:45,068;00:13:47,077;screaming that
165;00:13:45,068;00:13:47,077;the rules aren't fair.
166;00:13:47,077;00:13:49,089;You told me you liked this man.
166;00:13:47,077;00:13:49,089;I do.
167;00:13:49,089;00:13:53,039;In the time since he's met me,
167;00:13:49,089;00:13:53,039;he's refused to call me queen,
168;00:13:53,039;00:13:56,027;he's refused to bow, and now
168;00:13:53,039;00:13:56,027;he's calling me a child.
169;00:13:56,027;00:14:00,006;I believe he's calling all of us children.
169;00:13:56,027;00:14:00,006;Figure of speech.
170;00:14:00,006;00:14:03,039;Your Grace, everyone you know
170;00:14:00,006;00:14:03,039;will die before winter's over
171;00:14:03,039;00:14:05,056;if we don't defeat
171;00:14:03,039;00:14:05,056;the enemy to the north.
172;00:14:05,056;00:14:08,023;As far as I can see, you are
172;00:14:05,056;00:14:08,023;the enemy to the north.
173;00:14:08,023;00:14:09,089;I am not your enemy.
174;00:14:11,031;00:14:13,023;The dead are the enemy.
175;00:14:13,023;00:14:14,077;The dead?
176;00:14:16,006;00:14:17,064;Is that another
176;00:14:16,006;00:14:17,064;figure of speech?
177;00:14:17,064;00:14:19,027;The Army of the Dead
177;00:14:17,064;00:14:19,027;is on the march.
178;00:14:19,027;00:14:21,035;The Army of the Dead?
179;00:14:21,035;00:14:23,052;You don't know me well, my lord,
180;00:14:23,052;00:14:26,085;but do you think
180;00:14:23,052;00:14:26,085;I'm a liar or a madman?
181;00:14:26,085;00:14:29,039;No, I don't think
181;00:14:26,085;00:14:29,039;you're either of those things.
182;00:14:29,039;00:14:31,052;The Army of the Dead is real.
183;00:14:31,052;00:14:32,098;The white walkers are real.
184;00:14:32,098;00:14:35,089;The Night King is real.
184;00:14:32,098;00:14:35,089;I've seen them.
185;00:14:35,089;00:14:37,043;If they get past the Wall
186;00:14:37,043;00:14:39,093;and we're squabbling
186;00:14:37,043;00:14:39,093;amongst ourselves...
187;00:14:42,098;00:14:44,056;we're finished.
188;00:14:50,014;00:14:52,043;I was born at Dragonstone.
189;00:14:54,006;00:14:56,077;Not that I can remember it.
190;00:14:56,077;00:15:00,023;We fled before Robert's
190;00:14:56,077;00:15:00,023;assassins could find us.
191;00:15:00,023;00:15:03,043;Robert was your father's
191;00:15:00,023;00:15:03,043;best friend, no?
192;00:15:03,043;00:15:07,027;I wonder if your father knew
192;00:15:03,043;00:15:07,027;his best friend sent assassins
193;00:15:07,027;00:15:09,081;to murder a baby girl
193;00:15:07,027;00:15:09,081;in her crib.
194;00:15:11,027;00:15:13,018;Not that it matters now,
194;00:15:11,027;00:15:13,018;of course.
195;00:15:14,073;00:15:18,027;I spent my life
195;00:15:14,073;00:15:18,027;in foreign lands.
196;00:15:18,027;00:15:20,064;So many men
196;00:15:18,027;00:15:20,064;have tried to kill me,
197;00:15:20,064;00:15:24,014;I don't remember
197;00:15:20,064;00:15:24,014;all their names.
198;00:15:24,014;00:15:28,023;I have been sold
198;00:15:24,014;00:15:28,023;like a broodmare.
199;00:15:28,023;00:15:31,077;I've been chained and betrayed,
200;00:15:31,077;00:15:34,056;raped and defiled.
201;00:15:34,056;00:15:36,081;Do you know
201;00:15:34,056;00:15:36,081;what kept me standing
202;00:15:36,081;00:15:39,077;through all those years
202;00:15:36,081;00:15:39,077;in exile?
203;00:15:39,077;00:15:42,072;Faith.
204;00:15:42,073;00:15:44,098;Not in any gods,
205;00:15:44,098;00:15:48,052;not in myths and legends.
206;00:15:48,052;00:15:51,014;In myself.
207;00:15:51,014;00:15:54,031;In Daenerys Targaryen.
208;00:15:54,031;00:15:57,085;The world hadn't seen
208;00:15:54,031;00:15:57,085;a dragon in centuries
209;00:15:57,085;00:16:00,023;until my children were born.
210;00:16:00,023;00:16:05,002;The Dothraki hadn't
210;00:16:00,023;00:16:05,002;crossed the sea, any sea.
211;00:16:05,002;00:16:07,039;They did for me.
212;00:16:07,039;00:16:11,085;I was born to rule
212;00:16:07,039;00:16:11,085;the Seven Kingdoms,
213;00:16:11,085;00:16:13,098;and I will.
214;00:16:16,031;00:16:18,085;You'll be ruling
214;00:16:16,031;00:16:18,085;over a graveyard
215;00:16:18,085;00:16:21,018;if we don't defeat
215;00:16:18,085;00:16:21,018;the Night King.
216;00:16:22,060;00:16:25,081;The war against my sister
216;00:16:22,060;00:16:25,081;has already begun.
217;00:16:25,081;00:16:28,018;You can't expect us
217;00:16:25,081;00:16:28,018;to halt hostilities
218;00:16:28,018;00:16:30,002;and join you in fighting
219;00:16:30,002;00:16:31,052;whatever you saw
219;00:16:30,002;00:16:31,052;beyond the Wall.
220;00:16:34,039;00:16:35,093;You don't believe him.
221;00:16:35,093;00:16:38,085;I understand that.
221;00:16:35,093;00:16:38,085;It sounds like nonsense.
222;00:16:38,085;00:16:42,064;But if destiny has brought Daenerys
222;00:16:38,085;00:16:42,064;Targaryen back to our shores,
223;00:16:42,064;00:16:45,085;it has also made Jon Snow
223;00:16:42,064;00:16:45,085;King in the North.
224;00:16:45,085;00:16:48,098;You were the first to bring
224;00:16:45,085;00:16:48,098;Dothraki to Westeros?
225;00:16:48,098;00:16:52,035;He is the first to make allies
225;00:16:48,098;00:16:52,035;of wildlings and Northmen.
226;00:16:52,035;00:16:54,043;He was named Lord Commander
226;00:16:52,035;00:16:54,043;of the Night's Watch.
227;00:16:54,043;00:16:55,052;He was named King in the North.
228;00:16:55,052;00:16:56,089;Not because of his birthright.
229;00:16:56,089;00:16:59,027;He has no birthright.
229;00:16:56,089;00:16:59,027;He's a damn bastard.
230;00:16:59,027;00:17:04,031;All those hard sons of bitches
230;00:16:59,027;00:17:04,031;chose him as their leader
231;00:17:04,031;00:17:06,002;because they believe in him.
232;00:17:07,043;00:17:09,039;All those things
232;00:17:07,043;00:17:09,039;you don't believe in,
233;00:17:09,039;00:17:10,093;he faced those things.
234;00:17:10,093;00:17:13,014;He fought those things
234;00:17:10,093;00:17:13,014;for the good of his people.
235;00:17:13,014;00:17:14,072;He risked his life
235;00:17:13,014;00:17:14,072;for his people.
236;00:17:14,073;00:17:16,052;He took a knife in the
236;00:17:14,073;00:17:16,052;heart for his people.
237;00:17:16,052;00:17:18,027;He gave his own--
238;00:17:24,043;00:17:27,018;If we don't put aside our
238;00:17:24,043;00:17:27,018;enmities and band together,
239;00:17:27,018;00:17:29,027;we will die.
240;00:17:29,027;00:17:32,093;And then it doesn't matter whose
240;00:17:29,027;00:17:32,093;skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.
241;00:17:32,093;00:17:35,027;If it doesn't matter,
241;00:17:32,093;00:17:35,027;then you might as well kneel.
242;00:17:35,027;00:17:37,043;Swear your allegiance
242;00:17:35,027;00:17:37,043;to Queen Daenerys,
243;00:17:37,043;00:17:39,006;help her to defeat my sister,
244;00:17:39,006;00:17:41,023;and together, our armies
244;00:17:39,006;00:17:41,023;will protect the North.
245;00:17:41,023;00:17:42,098;There's no time for that.
246;00:17:42,098;00:17:44,089;There's no time for any of this!
247;00:17:44,089;00:17:46,039;While we stand here,
247;00:17:44,089;00:17:46,039;debating--
248;00:17:46,039;00:17:48,035;It takes no time
248;00:17:46,039;00:17:48,035;to bend the knee.
249;00:17:48,035;00:17:50,018;Pledge your sword to her cause.
250;00:17:50,018;00:17:51,093;And why would I do that?
251;00:17:54,081;00:17:56,093;I mean no offense, Your Grace,
252;00:17:56,093;00:17:58,014;but I don't know you.
253;00:17:58,014;00:17:59,098;As far as I can tell,
254;00:17:59,098;00:18:03,027;your claim to the throne rests
254;00:17:59,098;00:18:03,027;entirely on your father's name,
255;00:18:03,027;00:18:06,060;and my own father fought
255;00:18:03,027;00:18:06,060;to overthrow the Mad King.
256;00:18:08,052;00:18:10,039;The lords of the North
257;00:18:10,039;00:18:13,023;placed their trust
257;00:18:10,039;00:18:13,023;in me to lead them,
258;00:18:13,023;00:18:17,027;and I will continue to
258;00:18:13,023;00:18:17,027;do so as well as I can.
259;00:18:18,052;00:18:19,098;That's fair.
260;00:18:21,048;00:18:23,035;It's also fair to point out
261;00:18:23,035;00:18:27,047;that I'm the rightful
261;00:18:23,035;00:18:27,047;Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
262;00:18:27,048;00:18:31,023;By declaring yourself king
262;00:18:27,048;00:18:31,023;of the northernmost kingdom,
263;00:18:31,023;00:18:33,014;you are in open rebellion.
264;00:18:43,010;00:18:45,043;Your Grace,
264;00:18:43,010;00:18:45,043;please dismiss your guests.
265;00:18:45,043;00:18:47,052;I have grave news.
266;00:18:50,006;00:18:51,093;You must forgive my manners.
267;00:18:51,093;00:18:54,031;You'll both be tired
267;00:18:51,093;00:18:54,031;after your long journey.
268;00:18:54,031;00:18:57,006;We'll have baths drawn for you
268;00:18:54,031;00:18:57,006;and supper sent to your rooms.
269;00:19:06,052;00:19:07,085;Am I your prisoner?
270;00:19:11,085;00:19:13,014;Not yet.
271;00:19:30,056;00:19:32,027;Our ironborn and Dornish allies
272;00:19:32,027;00:19:33,072;were attacked en route to Dorne.
273;00:19:33,073;00:19:36,023;And?
273;00:19:33,073;00:19:36,023;Two or three ships escaped,
274;00:19:36,023;00:19:38,056;the rest, sunk or captured.
275;00:19:38,056;00:19:41,014;Ellaria and the Sand Snakes,
275;00:19:38,056;00:19:41,014;dead or captured.
276;00:19:41,014;00:19:43,072;The Greyjoys, dead or captured.
277;00:19:43,073;00:19:45,043;All of them?
278;00:19:48,068;00:19:50,056;Pull!
278;00:19:48,068;00:19:50,056;Heave!
279;00:19:50,056;00:19:51,093;Pull!
280;00:20:02,018;00:20:03,064;Your sister's dead?
281;00:20:05,014;00:20:07,018;Euron has her.
282;00:20:07,018;00:20:08,056;You saw him take her?
283;00:20:10,085;00:20:14,023;But you got away?
283;00:20:10,085;00:20:14,023;I couldn't save her.
284;00:20:14,023;00:20:15,073;I tried.
285;00:20:17,002;00:20:19,010;You wouldn't be here
285;00:20:17,002;00:20:19,010;if you tried.
286;00:20:23,060;00:20:25,047;Come, men!
287;00:20:25,048;00:20:26,081;Sails up!
288;00:20:35,043;00:20:37,043;Murderer!
289;00:20:48,018;00:20:50,031;Whores!
290;00:20:50,031;00:20:52,064;Traitor!
291;00:20:56,048;00:20:57,077;This is the life.
292;00:20:58,098;00:21:02,064;Look at them,
292;00:20:58,098;00:21:02,064;cheering for a Greyjoy.
293;00:21:06,098;00:21:08,056;I have to be honest,
294;00:21:08,056;00:21:10,052;this is making me hard.
295;00:21:13,052;00:21:15,023;Did you see Little Theon's face
296;00:21:15,023;00:21:17,060;right before
296;00:21:15,023;00:21:17,060;he jumped overboard?
297;00:21:17,060;00:21:20,014;Oh, no!
298;00:21:20,014;00:21:21,060;What a twat.
299;00:21:49,035;00:21:52,031;Whore! Whore! Whore!
299;00:21:49,035;00:21:52,031;Murderers!
300;00:22:25,060;00:22:28,093;My queen, please
300;00:22:25,060;00:22:28,093;accept this gift
301;00:22:28,093;00:22:32,077;on behalf of all of your loyal
301;00:22:28,093;00:22:32,077;subjects in the Iron Islands.
302;00:22:37,073;00:22:41,093;I give you what no
302;00:22:37,073;00:22:41,093;other man could give--
303;00:22:41,093;00:22:44,006;justice.
304;00:22:44,006;00:22:47,073;Justice for your
304;00:22:44,006;00:22:47,073;murdered daughter.
305;00:22:57,027;00:23:01,027;You've proven yourself the greatest
305;00:22:57,027;00:23:01,027;captain on the fourteen seas
306;00:23:01,027;00:23:03,093;and a true friend to the crown.
307;00:23:03,093;00:23:07,014;You deserve more
307;00:23:03,093;00:23:07,014;than a true friend.
308;00:23:07,014;00:23:10,064;And you deserve a proper
308;00:23:07,014;00:23:10,064;reward for your heroism.
309;00:23:10,064;00:23:13,031;There's only one reward I want.
310;00:23:14,060;00:23:17,031;You shall have
310;00:23:14,060;00:23:17,031;what your heart desires...
311;00:23:19,035;00:23:20,089;when the war is won.
312;00:23:27,027;00:23:30,072;With Euron Greyjoy
312;00:23:27,027;00:23:30,072;commanding our naval forces
313;00:23:30,073;00:23:33,089;and Jaime Lannister
313;00:23:30,073;00:23:33,089;leading our armies,
314;00:23:33,089;00:23:35,093;the sons and daughters
314;00:23:33,089;00:23:35,093;of Westeros
315;00:23:35,093;00:23:38,023;shall defend our country.
316;00:23:44,073;00:23:47,047;There's nothing quite
316;00:23:44,073;00:23:47,047;like it, is there?
317;00:23:47,048;00:23:49,023;The love of the people.
318;00:23:49,023;00:23:51,035;Though I suppose
318;00:23:49,023;00:23:51,035;you wouldn't know.
319;00:23:51,035;00:23:54,068;This same mob spat at
319;00:23:51,035;00:23:54,068;my sister not long ago.
320;00:23:54,068;00:23:56,043;And if you turn on us,
321;00:23:56,043;00:23:59,064;they'll cheer to see your
321;00:23:56,043;00:23:59,064;head mounted on a spike.
322;00:23:59,064;00:24:01,014;Or yours.
323;00:24:01,014;00:24:04,027;They just like
323;00:24:01,014;00:24:04,027;severed heads, really.
324;00:24:04,027;00:24:07,052;Listen, if you have
324;00:24:04,027;00:24:07,052;any advice at all,
325;00:24:07,052;00:24:09,010;I would love to hear it.
326;00:24:09,010;00:24:12,014;When we have an hour or two
326;00:24:09,010;00:24:12,014;to speak as brothers.
327;00:24:12,014;00:24:13,085;Advice?
328;00:24:13,085;00:24:17,052;Does she like it
328;00:24:13,085;00:24:17,052;gentle or rough?
329;00:24:17,052;00:24:19,018;A finger in the bum?
330;00:24:19,018;00:24:22,048;Shh, shh, shh, shh, not now.
330;00:24:19,018;00:24:22,048;We'll talk later.
331;00:24:40,031;00:24:43,027;I want you to know I understand.
332;00:24:43,027;00:24:44,085;Even though we're
332;00:24:43,027;00:24:44,085;enemies, you and I,
333;00:24:44,085;00:24:46,052;I understand the fury
333;00:24:44,085;00:24:46,052;that drives you.
334;00:24:47,068;00:24:49,002;I was there that day
335;00:24:49,002;00:24:50,081;when Ser Gregor crushed
335;00:24:49,002;00:24:50,081;your lover's head.
336;00:24:53,035;00:24:55,068;If I close my eyes,
337;00:24:55,068;00:24:58,068;I can hear the sound
337;00:24:55,068;00:24:58,068;of Oberyn's skull breaking.
338;00:24:58,068;00:25:00,089;The sound of your scream.
339;00:25:00,089;00:25:02,039;I never heard a sound like that.
340;00:25:02,039;00:25:04,035;I thought,
340;00:25:02,039;00:25:04,035;That's true love.
341;00:25:05,093;00:25:08,023;Oberyn looked beautiful that day.
341;00:25:05,093;00:25:08,023;He really did.
342;00:25:08,023;00:25:09,060;No one moved like him.
343;00:25:09,060;00:25:12,072;No one had such skill
343;00:25:09,060;00:25:12,072;with a spear.
344;00:25:12,073;00:25:15,081;Even Ser Gregor
344;00:25:12,073;00:25:15,081;couldn't stop him.
345;00:25:15,081;00:25:18,027;If only he hadn't taunted him.
346;00:25:18,027;00:25:22,023;He could've walked away and
346;00:25:18,027;00:25:22,023;left poor Ser Gregor to die.
347;00:25:22,023;00:25:24,027;But that wasn't
347;00:25:22,023;00:25:24,027;your lover's way, was it?
348;00:25:24,027;00:25:27,010;Now he's buried somewhere.
349;00:25:27,010;00:25:29,085;And here's Ser Gregor,
349;00:25:27,010;00:25:29,085;stronger than ever.
350;00:25:29,085;00:25:31,077;That must be difficult for you.
351;00:25:35,073;00:25:37,072;When my daughter
351;00:25:35,073;00:25:37,072;was taken from me,
352;00:25:37,073;00:25:40,085;my only daughter...
353;00:25:40,085;00:25:43,064;well, you can't
353;00:25:40,085;00:25:43,064;imagine how that feels
354;00:25:43,064;00:25:45,089;unless you've lost a child.
355;00:25:45,089;00:25:48,056;I fed her at my own breast
355;00:25:45,089;00:25:48,056;even though they told me
356;00:25:48,056;00:25:51,027;to give her to the wet nurse.
357;00:25:51,027;00:25:54,077;I couldn't bear to see her
357;00:25:51,027;00:25:54,077;in another woman's arms.
358;00:25:54,077;00:25:57,002;I never got to have a mother,
359;00:25:57,002;00:25:58,043;but Myrcella did.
360;00:25:58,043;00:26:02,010;She was mine,
360;00:25:58,043;00:26:02,010;and you took her from me.
361;00:26:02,010;00:26:04,014;Why did you do that?
362;00:26:10,073;00:26:12,010;Doesn't matter now.
363;00:26:20,068;00:26:23,043;Your daughter's a beauty, too.
364;00:26:23,043;00:26:26,006;Those brown eyes.
365;00:26:26,006;00:26:27,077;Those lips.
366;00:26:29,039;00:26:31,043;Perfect Dornish beauty.
367;00:26:31,043;00:26:33,031;I imagine she's your favorite.
368;00:26:33,031;00:26:36,047;I know, I know, we're not
368;00:26:33,031;00:26:36,047;supposed to have favorites,
369;00:26:36,048;00:26:38,064;but still, we're only human.
370;00:26:40,014;00:26:41,072;We love whom we love.
371;00:26:44,060;00:26:46,060;I'm sorry,
371;00:26:44,060;00:26:46,060;I can't understand you.
372;00:26:46,060;00:26:49,098;That gag makes it impossible to
372;00:26:46,060;00:26:49,098;understand what you're saying.
373;00:26:49,098;00:26:51,081;It must be frustrating.
374;00:26:54,098;00:26:57,098;We all make our choices.
375;00:26:57,098;00:27:00,039;You chose to murder my daughter.
376;00:27:00,039;00:27:02,064;You must have felt powerful
376;00:27:00,039;00:27:02,064;after you made that choice.
377;00:27:02,064;00:27:04,085;Do you feel powerful now?
378;00:27:11,043;00:27:12,081;I don't sleep very well.
379;00:27:12,081;00:27:15,018;Not at all, really.
380;00:27:15,018;00:27:17,010;I lie in bed
380;00:27:15,018;00:27:17,010;and I stare at the canopy
381;00:27:17,010;00:27:19,047;and imagine ways
381;00:27:17,010;00:27:19,047;of killing my enemies.
382;00:27:19,048;00:27:23,035;How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the
382;00:27:19,048;00:27:23,035;woman who murdered my only daughter.
383;00:27:24,085;00:27:26,052;I thought about
383;00:27:24,085;00:27:26,052;having Ser Gregor
384;00:27:26,052;00:27:28,068;crush your skull
384;00:27:26,052;00:27:28,068;the way he did Oberyn's.
385;00:27:28,068;00:27:33,039;It would be poetic, I
385;00:27:28,068;00:27:33,039;suppose, but fast, too fast.
386;00:27:33,039;00:27:36,035;I thought about having him
386;00:27:33,039;00:27:36,035;crush your daughter's skull.
387;00:27:37,043;00:27:39,018;She's so beautiful.
388;00:27:40,043;00:27:42,010;The thought of this lovely face
389;00:27:42,010;00:27:44,052;cracking open like a duck egg,
390;00:27:44,052;00:27:46,027;no, it's just not right.
391;00:27:53,073;00:27:54,085;Mama.
392;00:28:05,023;00:28:07,056;Qyburn here is
392;00:28:05,023;00:28:07,056;the cleverest man I know.
393;00:28:07,056;00:28:10,064;Clever enough to learn what poison
393;00:28:07,056;00:28:10,064;you used to murder Myrcella.
394;00:28:10,064;00:28:12,031;The Long Goodbye, was that it?
395;00:28:12,031;00:28:14,039;The Long Farewell.
395;00:28:12,031;00:28:14,039;That's the one.
396;00:28:18,073;00:28:20,023;How long does the poison take?
397;00:28:20,023;00:28:22,089;Difficult to
397;00:28:20,023;00:28:22,089;say-- hours, days.
398;00:28:22,089;00:28:24,077;It depends on the
398;00:28:22,089;00:28:24,077;subject's constitution.
399;00:28:24,077;00:28:28,027;But death is certain?
399;00:28:24,077;00:28:28,027;Oh, yes, Your Grace, quite certain.
400;00:28:33,064;00:28:36,052;Your daughter will die
400;00:28:33,064;00:28:36,052;here in this cell,
401;00:28:36,052;00:28:39,064;and you will be here
401;00:28:36,052;00:28:39,064;watching when she does.
402;00:28:39,064;00:28:42,043;You'll be here
402;00:28:39,064;00:28:42,043;the rest of your days.
403;00:28:44,031;00:28:48,027;If you refuse to eat, we'll
403;00:28:44,031;00:28:48,027;force food down your throat.
404;00:28:48,027;00:28:51,098;You will live to watch
404;00:28:48,027;00:28:51,098;your daughter rot.
405;00:28:51,098;00:28:55,027;To watch that beautiful face collapse...
406;00:28:55,027;00:28:57,039;...to bone and dust.
407;00:28:59,077;00:29:02,073;All the while contemplating
407;00:28:59,077;00:29:02,073;the choices you've made.
408;00:29:05,081;00:29:08,043;Make sure the guards change
408;00:29:05,081;00:29:08,043;the torches every few hours.
409;00:29:08,043;00:29:09,085;I don't want her
409;00:29:08,043;00:29:09,085;to miss a thing.
410;00:29:40,085;00:29:42,010;No.
411;00:30:24,035;00:30:25,035;Don't.
412;00:30:37,039;00:30:40,023;What are you doing?
412;00:30:37,039;00:30:40,023;No one can see us like this.
413;00:30:40,023;00:30:43,089;I am the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
413;00:30:40,023;00:30:43,089;I'll do as I please.
414;00:30:49,043;00:30:50,056;Forgive me, Your Grace.
415;00:30:50,056;00:30:52,089;The visitor from Braavos
415;00:30:50,056;00:30:52,089;has arrived.
416;00:30:52,089;00:30:55,089;Good. And we'll need
416;00:30:52,089;00:30:55,089;fresh sheets for the bed.
417;00:30:55,089;00:30:57,023;At once, Your Grace.
418;00:31:08,010;00:31:10,047;No, thank you.
419;00:31:10,048;00:31:12,018;My condolences, Your Grace,
420;00:31:12,018;00:31:14,014;on the death of your son.
421;00:31:14,014;00:31:16,085;From all reports,
421;00:31:14,014;00:31:16,085;he was a fine young man.
422;00:31:16,085;00:31:19,060;The Iron Bank didn't send you
422;00:31:16,085;00:31:19,060;here to offer condolences.
423;00:31:19,060;00:31:23,010;Condolences and congratulations.
424;00:31:23,010;00:31:26,006;To become the first ruling
424;00:31:23,010;00:31:26,006;Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,
425;00:31:26,006;00:31:28,006;that's quite an accomplishment.
426;00:31:28,006;00:31:31,085;The Iron Bank appreciates how you
426;00:31:28,006;00:31:31,085;cast off the yoke of superstition,
427;00:31:31,085;00:31:33,043;freeing the crown from elements
428;00:31:33,043;00:31:35,093;who sought to subvert
428;00:31:33,043;00:31:35,093;the rule of law.
429;00:31:35,093;00:31:39,010;The destruction of the Sept of
429;00:31:35,093;00:31:39,010;Baelor was a tragic accident.
430;00:31:39,010;00:31:43,031;Indeed, but sometimes
430;00:31:39,010;00:31:43,031;tragedies are necessary
431;00:31:43,031;00:31:45,068;to restore order
431;00:31:43,031;00:31:45,068;and rational leadership.
432;00:31:45,068;00:31:48,043;The Iron Bank
432;00:31:45,068;00:31:48,043;wants its gold back.
433;00:31:48,043;00:31:51,002;Your father never
433;00:31:48,043;00:31:51,002;minced words either.
434;00:31:51,002;00:31:54,085;But, yes, your debts
434;00:31:51,002;00:31:54,085;are considerable.
435;00:31:54,085;00:31:57,072;And you're now engaged in a
435;00:31:54,085;00:31:57,072;conflict on several fronts.
436;00:31:57,073;00:32:00,064;We both know how
436;00:31:57,073;00:32:00,064;expensive war can be.
437;00:32:00,064;00:32:02,085;And we both know gold wins wars.
438;00:32:02,085;00:32:04,031;Your vaults are empty.
439;00:32:04,031;00:32:06,081;Your late husband's
439;00:32:04,031;00:32:06,081;profligacy saw to that.
440;00:32:06,081;00:32:10,014;Your wealthiest allies, the
440;00:32:06,081;00:32:10,014;Tyrells, are now your enemies.
441;00:32:10,014;00:32:13,072;You are surrounded on all sides
441;00:32:10,014;00:32:13,072;by rivals for the throne.
442;00:32:13,073;00:32:15,068;And the Iron Bank
442;00:32:13,073;00:32:15,068;wants to bet on a winner.
443;00:32:15,068;00:32:17,039;We don't make bets.
444;00:32:17,039;00:32:20,098;We invest in endeavors we
444;00:32:17,039;00:32:20,098;deem likely to be successful.
445;00:32:20,098;00:32:23,093;A fancy way
445;00:32:20,098;00:32:23,093;of saying bet.
446;00:32:23,093;00:32:27,068;The war's already begun.
446;00:32:23,093;00:32:27,068;I've drawn first blood.
447;00:32:27,068;00:32:30,068;I decapitated the Dornish snake.
448;00:32:30,068;00:32:32,072;My armada owns the Narrow Sea.
449;00:32:32,073;00:32:35,018;Euron Greyjoy's armada
449;00:32:32,073;00:32:35,018;owns the Narrow Sea.
450;00:32:35,018;00:32:36,068;Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.
451;00:32:36,068;00:32:38,089;For now.
452;00:32:38,089;00:32:42,064;Daenerys Targaryen has
452;00:32:38,089;00:32:42,064;three full-grown dragons.
453;00:32:42,064;00:32:46,098;How well do wooden ships fare
453;00:32:42,064;00:32:46,098;against fire-breathing dragons?
454;00:32:46,098;00:32:52,002;Her dragons might not be
454;00:32:46,098;00:32:52,002;as invulnerable as some think.
455;00:32:52,002;00:32:54,039;But let's talk about
455;00:32:52,002;00:32:54,039;the Targaryen girl.
456;00:32:54,039;00:32:56,031;You want to invest in her?
457;00:32:56,031;00:33:00,068;I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested
457;00:32:56,031;00:33:00,068;considerable gold in the slave trade.
458;00:33:00,068;00:33:02,093;How are your profits
459;00:33:02,093;00:33:05,047;now that Daenerys
459;00:33:02,093;00:33:05,047;has freed all the slaves?
460;00:33:05,048;00:33:09,064;The slave trade has entered
460;00:33:05,048;00:33:09,064;a downturn, it's true.
461;00:33:09,064;00:33:11,052;From what I gather,
461;00:33:09,064;00:33:11,052;she considers herself
462;00:33:11,052;00:33:14,085;more of a revolutionary
462;00:33:11,052;00:33:14,085;than a monarch.
463;00:33:14,085;00:33:18,077;In your experience, how do bankers
463;00:33:14,085;00:33:18,077;usually fare with revolutionaries?
464;00:33:18,077;00:33:21,077;The Lannisters owe the Iron
464;00:33:18,077;00:33:21,077;Bank quite a lot of money,
465;00:33:21,077;00:33:23,093;but Lannisters
465;00:33:21,077;00:33:23,093;always pay their debts.
466;00:33:23,093;00:33:28,035;Do former slaves
466;00:33:23,093;00:33:28,035;or Dothraki or dragons?
467;00:33:31,093;00:33:33,093;Your father's daughter, indeed.
468;00:33:33,093;00:33:35,027;Give me a fortnight.
469;00:33:35,027;00:33:37,047;Stay in King's Landing
469;00:33:35,027;00:33:37,047;as my honored guest.
470;00:33:37,048;00:33:38,089;And when you return to Braavos,
471;00:33:38,089;00:33:43,035;I swear to you, my debt
471;00:33:38,089;00:33:43,035;will be paid in full.
472;00:34:06,098;00:34:10,081;I came down here to brood over my
472;00:34:06,098;00:34:10,081;failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.
473;00:34:13,035;00:34:14,089;You're making it difficult.
474;00:34:14,089;00:34:18,056;You look a lot better
474;00:34:14,089;00:34:18,056;brooding than I do.
475;00:34:20,027;00:34:22,081;You make me feel like I'm failing
475;00:34:20,027;00:34:22,081;at brooding over failing.
476;00:34:22,081;00:34:24,052;I'm a prisoner on this island.
477;00:34:24,052;00:34:28,047;I wouldn't say you're
477;00:34:24,052;00:34:28,047;a prisoner on this island.
478;00:34:28,048;00:34:29,098;You're free to walk the castle,
479;00:34:29,098;00:34:31,089;the beaches,
479;00:34:29,098;00:34:31,089;to go wherever you want.
480;00:34:31,089;00:34:34,006;Except to my ship.
481;00:34:34,006;00:34:35,047;You took my ship.
482;00:34:35,048;00:34:37,043;I wouldn't say
482;00:34:35,048;00:34:37,043;we took your ship.
483;00:34:37,043;00:34:39,093;I'm not playing
483;00:34:37,043;00:34:39,093;word games with you.
484;00:34:39,093;00:34:41,081;The dead are coming for us all.
485;00:34:41,081;00:34:43,047;Why don't you
485;00:34:41,081;00:34:43,047;figure out what to do
486;00:34:43,048;00:34:45,056;about my missing fleet
486;00:34:43,048;00:34:45,056;and murdered allies,
487;00:34:45,056;00:34:48,043;and I'll figure out what to do
487;00:34:45,056;00:34:48,043;about your walking dead men.
488;00:34:48,043;00:34:50,064;It's hard for me to fathom.
488;00:34:48,043;00:34:50,064;It really is.
489;00:34:50,064;00:34:53,077;If someone told me about the white
489;00:34:50,064;00:34:53,077;walkers and the Night King...
490;00:35:01,018;00:35:02,043;You probably don't believe me.
491;00:35:04,089;00:35:07,006;I do, actually.
492;00:35:07,006;00:35:08,060;You didn't before.
493;00:35:10,031;00:35:12,052;Grumkins and snarks,
493;00:35:10,031;00:35:12,052;you called them.
494;00:35:12,052;00:35:14,060;Do you remember?
495;00:35:14,060;00:35:16,068;You said it was all nonsense.
496;00:35:16,068;00:35:19,081;It was nonsense.
496;00:35:16,068;00:35:19,081;Everybody knew it.
497;00:35:19,081;00:35:22,093;But then Mormont saw them
498;00:35:22,093;00:35:24,035;and you saw them.
499;00:35:24,035;00:35:26,002;And I trust the eyes
499;00:35:24,035;00:35:26,002;of an honest man
500;00:35:26,002;00:35:28,002;more than I trust
500;00:35:26,002;00:35:28,002;what everybody knows.
501;00:35:29,035;00:35:31,060;How do I convince people
501;00:35:29,035;00:35:31,060;who don't know me
502;00:35:31,060;00:35:34,035;that an enemy they don't believe
502;00:35:31,060;00:35:34,035;in is coming to kill them all?
503;00:35:34,035;00:35:37,068;Good question.
503;00:35:34,035;00:35:37,068;I know it's a good question.
504;00:35:37,068;00:35:39,085;I'm looking for an answer.
505;00:35:39,085;00:35:44,014;People's minds aren't made
505;00:35:39,085;00:35:44,014;for problems that large.
506;00:35:44,014;00:35:46,060;White walkers, the Night King,
507;00:35:46,060;00:35:48,068;Army of the Dead--
508;00:35:48,068;00:35:50,031;it's almost a relief to confront
509;00:35:50,031;00:35:53,018;a comfortable, familiar
509;00:35:50,031;00:35:53,018;monster like my sister.
510;00:35:55,052;00:35:58,048;I need to help prepare my
510;00:35:55,052;00:35:58,048;people for what's coming.
511;00:36:00,018;00:36:02,052;I can't help them from here.
512;00:36:04,002;00:36:05,027;I'd like to leave.
513;00:36:06,073;00:36:09,023;It seems unlikely that
513;00:36:06,073;00:36:09,023;you became King in the North
514;00:36:09,023;00:36:10,089;by giving up that easily.
515;00:36:13,006;00:36:16,018;Everyone told me to learn
515;00:36:13,006;00:36:16,018;from my father's mistakes.
516;00:36:16,018;00:36:17,098;Don't go south.
517;00:36:17,098;00:36:20,064;Don't answer a summons
517;00:36:17,098;00:36:20,064;from the Mad King's daughter,
518;00:36:20,064;00:36:22,006;a foreign invader.
519;00:36:24,043;00:36:27,014;And here I am,
520;00:36:27,014;00:36:28,068;a Northern fool.
521;00:36:28,068;00:36:31,014;Children are not their fathers,
522;00:36:31,014;00:36:32,085;luckily for all of us.
523;00:36:34,035;00:36:36,056;And sometimes there's more
523;00:36:34,035;00:36:36,056;to foreign invaders
524;00:36:36,056;00:36:38,077;and Northern fools
524;00:36:36,056;00:36:38,077;than meets the eye.
525;00:36:38,077;00:36:42,098;Daenerys could have sailed for
525;00:36:38,077;00:36:42,098;Westeros long ago, but she didn't.
526;00:36:42,098;00:36:44,081;Instead, she stayed
526;00:36:42,098;00:36:44,081;where she was
527;00:36:44,081;00:36:47,047;and saved many people
527;00:36:44,081;00:36:47,047;from horrible fates,
528;00:36:47,048;00:36:49,081;some of whom are on this
528;00:36:47,048;00:36:49,081;island with us right now.
529;00:36:49,081;00:36:51,039;While you're our guest here,
530;00:36:51,039;00:36:52,093;you might consider asking them
531;00:36:52,093;00:36:55,068;what they think
531;00:36:52,093;00:36:55,068;of the Mad King's daughter.
532;00:36:55,068;00:36:58,077;She protects people
532;00:36:55,068;00:36:58,077;from monsters,
533;00:36:58,077;00:37:00,031;just as you do.
534;00:37:00,031;00:37:02,077;It's why she came here.
535;00:37:02,077;00:37:04,031;And she's not about
535;00:37:02,077;00:37:04,031;to head north
536;00:37:04,031;00:37:05,077;to fight an enemy
536;00:37:04,031;00:37:05,077;she's never seen
537;00:37:05,077;00:37:08,027;on the word of a man
537;00:37:05,077;00:37:08,027;she doesn't know.
538;00:37:08,027;00:37:10,068;After a single meeting,
539;00:37:10,068;00:37:13,048;it's not a reasonable
539;00:37:10,068;00:37:13,048;thing to ask.
540;00:37:19,085;00:37:22,010;So, do you have anything
540;00:37:19,085;00:37:22,010;reasonable to ask?
541;00:37:26,093;00:37:28,010;What do you mean?
542;00:37:28,010;00:37:30,035;Maybe you are a Northern fool.
543;00:37:30,035;00:37:34,002;I'm asking if there's something
543;00:37:30,035;00:37:34,002;I can do to help you.
544;00:37:36,098;00:37:38,052;Dragonglass?
544;00:37:36,098;00:37:38,052;Yes.
545;00:37:38,052;00:37:40,098;Volcanic glass, obsidian.
546;00:37:40,098;00:37:42,098;He says you have a tremendous
546;00:37:40,098;00:37:42,098;amount of it here.
547;00:37:42,098;00:37:44,077;Why are we talking about glass?
548;00:37:44,077;00:37:46,064;We just lost two of our allies.
549;00:37:46,064;00:37:50,002;Which is why I was speaking to
549;00:37:46,064;00:37:50,002;Jon Snow, a potential ally.
550;00:37:52,039;00:37:56,014;And what does the King in the
550;00:37:52,039;00:37:56,014;North want with dragonglass?
551;00:37:56,014;00:37:58,047;Apparently, it can be
551;00:37:56,014;00:37:58,047;turned into weapons
552;00:37:58,048;00:38:01,060;that kill white walkers
552;00:37:58,048;00:38:01,060;and their foot soldiers.
553;00:38:01,060;00:38:03,077;Or stop them.
554;00:38:03,077;00:38:05,006;Destroy them.
555;00:38:05,006;00:38:06,068;Unsure about the nomenclature.
556;00:38:08,064;00:38:11,060;And what do you think
556;00:38:08,064;00:38:11,060;about this Army of the Dead
557;00:38:11,060;00:38:14,047;and white walkers
557;00:38:11,060;00:38:14,047;and Night Kings?
558;00:38:14,048;00:38:17,010;I'd very much like to believe
558;00:38:14,048;00:38:17,010;that Jon Snow is wrong.
559;00:38:17,010;00:38:20,035;But a wise man once said that you
559;00:38:17,010;00:38:20,035;should never believe a thing
560;00:38:20,035;00:38:22,089;simply because
560;00:38:20,035;00:38:22,089;you want to believe it.
561;00:38:25,060;00:38:28,077;Which wise man said this?
562;00:38:28,077;00:38:30,064;I don't remember.
563;00:38:30,064;00:38:34,006;Are you trying to present your own
563;00:38:30,064;00:38:34,006;statements as ancient wisdom?
564;00:38:35,027;00:38:37,047;I would never do that.
565;00:38:37,048;00:38:38,052;To you.
566;00:38:40,035;00:38:44,002;The reason I believe Jon
566;00:38:40,035;00:38:44,002;Snow is because he's here.
567;00:38:44,002;00:38:46,043;All of his advisors would
567;00:38:44,002;00:38:46,043;have told him not to come.
568;00:38:46,043;00:38:48,052;I would have told him
568;00:38:46,043;00:38:48,052;not to come.
569;00:38:48,052;00:38:50,085;And he's here anyway.
570;00:38:50,085;00:38:53,027;You don't have to believe him.
571;00:38:53,027;00:38:55,031;Let him mine the dragonglass.
572;00:38:55,031;00:38:56,093;If he's wrong, it's worthless.
573;00:38:56,093;00:38:59,002;You didn't even know
573;00:38:56,093;00:38:59,002;it was here.
574;00:38:59,002;00:39:01,056;It's nothing to you.
575;00:39:01,056;00:39:04,085;Give him something
575;00:39:01,056;00:39:04,085;by giving him nothing.
576;00:39:04,085;00:39:07,056;Take a step toward a more
576;00:39:04,085;00:39:07,056;productive relationship
577;00:39:07,056;00:39:10,014;with a possible ally.
578;00:39:10,014;00:39:13,052;Keep him occupied while we
578;00:39:10,014;00:39:13,052;focus on the task at hand--
579;00:39:13,052;00:39:14,089;Casterly Rock.
580;00:39:16,014;00:39:17,093;What was that Ser Davos said
581;00:39:17,093;00:39:21,098;about taking a knife in
581;00:39:17,093;00:39:21,098;the heart for his people?
582;00:39:21,098;00:39:23,077;Did you notice that?
583;00:39:23,077;00:39:26,023;You must allow them
583;00:39:23,077;00:39:26,023;their flights of fancy.
584;00:39:26,023;00:39:28,039;It's dreary in the North.
585;00:39:44,027;00:39:45,077;Amazing thing to see.
586;00:39:47,027;00:39:50,031;I named them for my brothers,
586;00:39:47,027;00:39:50,031;Viserys and Rhaegar.
587;00:39:51,043;00:39:52,093;They're both gone now.
588;00:39:55,023;00:39:56,060;You lost two brothers as well.
589;00:39:59,077;00:40:02,064;People thought dragons were gone
589;00:39:59,077;00:40:02,064;forever, but here they are.
590;00:40:04,039;00:40:07,023;Perhaps we should all be
590;00:40:04,039;00:40:07,023;examining what we think we know.
591;00:40:13,018;00:40:15,047;You've been talking to Tyrion.
592;00:40:15,048;00:40:18,023;He is my Hand.
593;00:40:18,023;00:40:20,085;He enjoys talking.
593;00:40:18,023;00:40:20,085;We all enjoy what we're good at.
594;00:40:22,031;00:40:23,081;I don't.
595;00:40:28,081;00:40:31,081;You know I'm not going to let
595;00:40:28,081;00:40:31,081;Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.
596;00:40:31,081;00:40:32,098;I never expected that you would.
597;00:40:32,098;00:40:34,023;And I haven't changed my mind
598;00:40:34,023;00:40:36,031;about which kingdoms
598;00:40:34,023;00:40:36,031;belong to that throne.
599;00:40:36,031;00:40:38,014;I haven't either.
600;00:40:47,048;00:40:51,068;I will allow you to mine the
600;00:40:47,048;00:40:51,068;dragonglass and forge weapons from it.
601;00:40:51,068;00:40:54,068;Any resources or men you need,
601;00:40:51,068;00:40:54,068;I will provide for you.
602;00:40:58,018;00:40:59,018;Thank you.
603;00:41:05,068;00:41:09,035;So you believe me, then, about the
603;00:41:05,068;00:41:09,035;Night King and the Army of the Dead?
604;00:41:12,052;00:41:15,023;You'd better
604;00:41:12,052;00:41:15,023;get to work, Jon Snow.
605;00:41:39,089;00:41:41,052;How much do we have?
606;00:41:41,052;00:41:43,060;4,000 bushels, my lady.
607;00:41:43,060;00:41:44,077;What does that mean?
608;00:41:44,077;00:41:46,085;For the current
608;00:41:44,077;00:41:46,085;occupants of the castle,
609;00:41:46,085;00:41:50,052;it's enough food
609;00:41:46,085;00:41:50,052;for a year, perhaps more.
610;00:41:50,052;00:41:53,093;And what's the longest winter
610;00:41:50,052;00:41:53,093;in the past hundred years?
611;00:41:53,093;00:41:56,039;Uh, I'm not entirely certain.
612;00:41:56,039;00:41:58,023;I-I'll check
612;00:41:56,039;00:41:58,023;Maester Luwin's records.
613;00:41:58,023;00:42:01,072;He kept a copy
613;00:41:58,023;00:42:01,072;of every raven scroll.
614;00:42:01,073;00:42:03,085;You're telling me
614;00:42:01,073;00:42:03,085;we don't have enough food,
615;00:42:03,085;00:42:07,006;especially not if the armies of the
615;00:42:03,085;00:42:07,006;North come back to defend Winterfell?
616;00:42:08,031;00:42:10,056;No, my lady, most likely not.
617;00:42:10,056;00:42:12,068;Then we must prepare
617;00:42:10,056;00:42:12,068;for that eventuality.
618;00:42:12,068;00:42:14,077;Whatever direction
618;00:42:12,068;00:42:14,077;the threat comes from,
619;00:42:14,077;00:42:17,006;this is the best place to be.
620;00:42:17,006;00:42:19,002;We need to start
620;00:42:17,006;00:42:19,002;building up our grain stores
621;00:42:19,002;00:42:21,060;with regular shipments
621;00:42:19,002;00:42:21,060;from every keep in the North.
622;00:42:21,060;00:42:23,089;If we don't use it by winter's
622;00:42:21,060;00:42:23,089;end, we'll give it back to them.
623;00:42:23,089;00:42:26,023;But if the entire North
623;00:42:23,089;00:42:26,023;has to flee to Winterfell,
624;00:42:26,023;00:42:29,093;they won't have enough time to bring
624;00:42:26,023;00:42:29,093;wagonloads of grain with them.
625;00:42:29,093;00:42:31,035;Very wise, my lady.
626;00:42:31,035;00:42:33,014;Maester Wolkan,
626;00:42:31,035;00:42:33,014;you'll see to it?
627;00:42:36,093;00:42:39,043;Are they covering those
627;00:42:36,093;00:42:39,043;breastplates in leather?
628;00:42:39,043;00:42:40,081;No, my lady.
629;00:42:40,081;00:42:43,089;Well, shouldn't they be?
629;00:42:40,081;00:42:43,089;Once the real cold comes?
630;00:42:43,089;00:42:45,031;They should, indeed.
631;00:42:45,031;00:42:47,052;Pardon me, my lady.
632;00:42:47,052;00:42:50,010;You there, why isn't
632;00:42:47,052;00:42:50,010;there leather on these?
633;00:42:52,010;00:42:53,089;Command suits you.
634;00:42:55,060;00:42:57,068;The Northerners
634;00:42:55,060;00:42:57,068;are all facing north,
635;00:42:57,068;00:42:59,077;worried about the threat
635;00:42:57,068;00:42:59,077;from beyond the Wall.
636;00:42:59,077;00:43:01,031;So they should be.
637;00:43:01,031;00:43:03,098;I know Cersei
637;00:43:01,031;00:43:03,098;better than anyone here.
638;00:43:03,098;00:43:06,006;If you turn
638;00:43:03,098;00:43:06,006;your back on her--
639;00:43:06,006;00:43:08,063;You don't know Cersei
639;00:43:06,006;00:43:08,063;better than anyone here.
640;00:43:09,019;00:43:10,046;I only meant to say--
641;00:43:10,058;00:43:13,052;That the woman who murdered my mother,
641;00:43:10,058;00:43:13,052;father, and brother is dangerous?
642;00:43:13,052;00:43:15,060;Thank you for your wise counsel.
643;00:43:16,089;00:43:19,010;One of two things
643;00:43:16,089;00:43:19,010;will happen--
644;00:43:19,010;00:43:21,039;either the dead
644;00:43:19,010;00:43:21,039;will defeat the living,
645;00:43:21,039;00:43:23,035;in which case...
646;00:43:23,035;00:43:25,043;all our troubles come to an end,
647;00:43:25,043;00:43:27,081;or life will win out.
648;00:43:27,081;00:43:29,081;And what then?
649;00:43:29,081;00:43:33,081;Don't fight in the
649;00:43:29,081;00:43:33,081;North or the South.
650;00:43:35,039;00:43:40,027;Fight every battle, everywhere,
650;00:43:35,039;00:43:40,027;always, in your mind.
651;00:43:42,018;00:43:44,006;Everyone is your enemy,
652;00:43:44,006;00:43:46,098;everyone is your friend...
653;00:43:46,098;00:43:51,010;every possible series of events
653;00:43:46,098;00:43:51,010;is happening all at once.
654;00:43:51,010;00:43:54,068;Live that way and nothing
654;00:43:51,010;00:43:54,068;will surprise you.
655;00:43:54,068;00:43:57,027;Everything that happens
655;00:43:54,068;00:43:57,027;will be something
656;00:43:57,027;00:43:59,018;that you've seen before.
657;00:44:01,043;00:44:04,018;Lady Sansa, at the gate.
658;00:44:36,073;00:44:37,089;Hello, Sansa.
659;00:44:58,077;00:45:00,089;I wish Jon were here.
660;00:45:00,089;00:45:03,077;Yes, I need to speak to him.
661;00:45:07,093;00:45:10,056;You're Father's
661;00:45:07,093;00:45:10,056;last living trueborn son.
662;00:45:12,039;00:45:15,027;You're Lord of Winterfell now.
663;00:45:15,027;00:45:18,052;I can never be
663;00:45:15,027;00:45:18,052;Lord of Winterfell.
664;00:45:18,052;00:45:20,035;I can never be lord of anything.
665;00:45:20,035;00:45:21,060;I'm the Three-Eyed Raven.
666;00:45:23,068;00:45:25,047;I don't know what that means.
667;00:45:25,048;00:45:27,089;It's difficult to explain.
668;00:45:27,089;00:45:30,010;Try.
668;00:45:27,089;00:45:30,010;Please, for me.
669;00:45:31,081;00:45:34,077;It means I can see everything.
670;00:45:34,077;00:45:37,010;Everything that's ever
670;00:45:34,077;00:45:37,010;happened to everyone.
671;00:45:37,010;00:45:40,010;Everything that's
671;00:45:37,010;00:45:40,010;happening right now.
672;00:45:40,010;00:45:44,089;It's all pieces now, fragments.
673;00:45:44,089;00:45:47,010;I need to learn to see better.
674;00:45:47,010;00:45:50,052;When the Long Night comes again,
675;00:45:50,052;00:45:52,014;I need to be ready.
676;00:45:55,018;00:45:57,060;How do you know all this?
677;00:45:57,060;00:45:59,014;The Three-Eyed Raven
677;00:45:57,060;00:45:59,014;taught me.
678;00:45:59,014;00:46:01,006;I thought you were
678;00:45:59,014;00:46:01,006;the Three-Eyed Raven.
679;00:46:01,006;00:46:03,081;I told you it's
679;00:46:01,006;00:46:03,081;difficult to explain.
680;00:46:05,098;00:46:07,047;Bran--
681;00:46:07,048;00:46:09,085;I'm sorry for all
681;00:46:07,048;00:46:09,085;that's happened to you.
682;00:46:09,085;00:46:13,085;I'm sorry it had to
682;00:46:09,085;00:46:13,085;happen here in our home.
683;00:46:19,006;00:46:21,014;It was so beautiful that night.
684;00:46:23,014;00:46:27,014;Snow falling, just like now.
685;00:46:30,039;00:46:32,023;And you were so beautiful...
686;00:46:34,018;00:46:35,098;in your white wedding dress.
687;00:46:39,085;00:46:41,073;I have to go back inside, Bran.
688;00:46:43,010;00:46:44,081;I'll stay a bit longer.
689;00:46:58,052;00:47:00,006;Hmm.
690;00:47:08,056;00:47:10,039;Hmm.
691;00:47:15,085;00:47:17,072;Does it hurt?
692;00:47:17,073;00:47:20,043;A bit.
692;00:47:17,073;00:47:20,043;Less than before.
693;00:47:22,023;00:47:24,085;The infection no longer
693;00:47:22,023;00:47:24,085;appears to be active.
694;00:47:26,043;00:47:28,027;Unusual.
695;00:47:28,027;00:47:29,072;Unlikely.
696;00:47:29,073;00:47:31,072;One could almost be forgiven
697;00:47:31,073;00:47:35,031;for thinking that the entire upper
697;00:47:31,073;00:47:35,031;layer of diseased skin was debrided
698;00:47:35,031;00:47:39,068;and the underlying region treated
698;00:47:35,031;00:47:39,068;with some sort of unguent.
699;00:47:39,068;00:47:42,098;Don't know anything about that.
700;00:47:42,098;00:47:45,006;I just started feeling better.
701;00:47:45,006;00:47:48,073;I assumed it was
701;00:47:45,006;00:47:48,073;the rest that did it.
702;00:47:50,068;00:47:53,031;And the climate.
703;00:47:53,031;00:47:55,027;The climate.
704;00:47:55,027;00:47:57,006;You're free to go, ser.
705;00:47:57,006;00:47:59,010;This chamber is needed
705;00:47:57,006;00:47:59,010;for the infectious,
706;00:47:59,010;00:48:00,081;which you are no longer.
707;00:48:00,081;00:48:04,031;Tarly, I'd like to speak with
707;00:48:00,081;00:48:04,031;you in my study this evening.
708;00:48:07,027;00:48:08,056;How bad is it?
709;00:48:10,023;00:48:11,060;Suppose I'll find out
709;00:48:10,023;00:48:11,060;this evening.
710;00:48:16,073;00:48:19,043;Where will you go?
711;00:48:19,043;00:48:23,014;I surrendered to this sickness
711;00:48:19,043;00:48:23,014;the moment I first saw it.
712;00:48:24,060;00:48:27,043;I knew it would kill me
713;00:48:27,043;00:48:30,010;or I'd kill myself
713;00:48:27,043;00:48:30,010;before it could.
714;00:48:30,010;00:48:33,035;Daenerys Stormborn
714;00:48:30,010;00:48:33,035;convinced me otherwise.
715;00:48:33,035;00:48:36,098;The only place for me
715;00:48:33,035;00:48:36,098;is back with her.
716;00:48:36,098;00:48:39,039;I owe her my life.
717;00:48:39,039;00:48:41,098;Her and you.
718;00:48:44,018;00:48:46,052;Your father saved me
718;00:48:44,018;00:48:46,052;more than once.
719;00:48:46,052;00:48:48,031;It's the least I could do.
720;00:48:49,081;00:48:53,018;Perhaps our paths
720;00:48:49,081;00:48:53,018;will cross again.
721;00:48:53,018;00:48:54,060;I hope they do.
722;00:49:21,073;00:49:25,018;You treated him?
722;00:49:21,073;00:49:25,018;Yes.
723;00:49:25,018;00:49:27,068;Who told you to treat him?
724;00:49:27,068;00:49:29,002;No one.
725;00:49:29,002;00:49:32,031;Who forbade you, or anyone,
725;00:49:29,002;00:49:32,031;to attempt to treat him?
726;00:49:32,031;00:49:35,002;I seem to remember you.
727;00:49:35,002;00:49:37,085;But you treated him anyway?
727;00:49:35,002;00:49:37,085;I did, yes.
728;00:49:39,052;00:49:42,064;I forbade it because it is
728;00:49:39,052;00:49:42,064;dangerous and rarely successful,
729;00:49:42,064;00:49:44,098;especially on
729;00:49:42,064;00:49:44,098;someone of that age.
730;00:49:44,098;00:49:47,018;You could have infected
730;00:49:44,098;00:49:47,018;yourself and others.
731;00:49:47,018;00:49:50,064;You could have devastated
731;00:49:47,018;00:49:50,064;the entire Citadel.
732;00:49:52,093;00:49:54,085;But you didn't.
733;00:49:54,085;00:49:57,047;It's a meticulous,
733;00:49:54,085;00:49:57,047;difficult procedure.
734;00:49:57,048;00:50:00,089;Many maesters whose chains
734;00:49:57,048;00:50:00,089;are heavy with healing links
735;00:50:00,089;00:50:03,035;have attempted it and failed.
736;00:50:03,035;00:50:05,043;Yet you succeeded.
737;00:50:05,043;00:50:06,056;How?
738;00:50:08,056;00:50:11,085;I read the books
738;00:50:08,056;00:50:11,085;and followed the instructions.
739;00:50:22,023;00:50:24,043;That man is alive
739;00:50:22,023;00:50:24,043;because of you.
740;00:50:26,073;00:50:28,035;You should be proud.
741;00:50:31,043;00:50:33,093;Thank you, Archmaester.
742;00:50:33,093;00:50:34,093;Come here.
743;00:50:38,089;00:50:42,056;All these manuscripts
743;00:50:38,089;00:50:42,056;and scrolls are rotting away.
744;00:50:42,056;00:50:45,023;I need you
744;00:50:42,056;00:50:45,023;to make copies of them.
745;00:50:49,052;00:50:51,060;You were expecting a reward.
746;00:50:53,031;00:50:57,010;Your reward is not being immediately
746;00:50:53,031;00:50:57,010;expelled from the Citadel.
747;00:50:58,027;00:51:00,027;You'd better get started.
748;00:51:00,027;00:51:01,093;And careful of the paper mites.
749;00:51:01,093;00:51:03,027;They like flesh as well.
750;00:51:10,052;00:51:13,089;We need to find Euron
750;00:51:10,052;00:51:13,089;Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
751;00:51:13,089;00:51:17,039;Your Grace, he's already destroyed
751;00:51:13,089;00:51:17,039;a good portion of our fleet.
752;00:51:17,039;00:51:18,093;To send our remaining
752;00:51:17,039;00:51:18,093;ships after him--
753;00:51:18,093;00:51:21,060;I'm not talking about
753;00:51:18,093;00:51:21,060;sending our ships after him.
754;00:51:25,043;00:51:26,098;Would you have to go yourself?
755;00:51:26,098;00:51:28,098;Euron's ships could be anywhere
756;00:51:28,098;00:51:30,098;or in more than one place.
757;00:51:30,098;00:51:33,039;You'd be flying around
757;00:51:30,098;00:51:33,039;the open seas alone
758;00:51:33,039;00:51:34,043;for who knows how long.
759;00:51:34,043;00:51:36,006;I wouldn't be alone.
760;00:51:36,006;00:51:38,064;I would have Drogon,
760;00:51:36,006;00:51:38,064;Viserion, and Rhaegal.
761;00:51:38,064;00:51:40,043;What can anyone do to them?
762;00:51:40,043;00:51:42,043;They can still
762;00:51:40,043;00:51:42,043;do something to you.
763;00:51:42,043;00:51:44,023;It only takes one arrow.
764;00:51:44,023;00:51:46,077;It's too great a risk.
764;00:51:44,023;00:51:46,077;You're too important.
765;00:51:49,010;00:51:51,023;What about Casterly Rock?
766;00:51:51,023;00:51:53,018;The Unsullied
766;00:51:51,023;00:51:53,018;will be there soon.
767;00:51:53,018;00:51:55,077;And what will they face?
768;00:51:55,077;00:51:58,018;A difficult situation.
769;00:51:58,018;00:52:00,031;They know we're coming.
770;00:52:00,031;00:52:03,064;Yes. Cersei believes
770;00:52:00,031;00:52:03,064;my sole purpose in life
771;00:52:03,064;00:52:05,027;is to destroy House Lannister.
772;00:52:05,027;00:52:07,002;She will be ready.
773;00:52:11,002;00:52:13,064;No one has ever taken the Rock.
773;00:52:11,002;00:52:13,064;Archers!
774;00:52:13,064;00:52:16,002;The Lannister Army is
774;00:52:13,064;00:52:16,002;still the army my father built.
775;00:52:16,002;00:52:18,035;Come on!
775;00:52:16,002;00:52:18,035;Well-trained and well-provisioned.
776;00:52:18,035;00:52:20,014;10,000 men at least.
777;00:52:20,014;00:52:21,014;They will see us coming.
778;00:52:25,068;00:52:27,035;They will be ready.
779;00:52:30,064;00:52:32,068;Draw! Loose!
779;00:52:30,064;00:52:32,068;Loose!
780;00:52:34,089;00:52:38,002;The gates of Casterly
780;00:52:34,089;00:52:38,002;Rock are impregnable.
781;00:52:45,073;00:52:47,098;The fight up the walls
781;00:52:45,073;00:52:47,098;will be hard.
782;00:52:47,098;00:52:49,052;We will be at a disadvantage.
783;00:52:50,089;00:52:52,056;Many men will die.
784;00:52:54,073;00:52:56,077;Just as my father
784;00:52:54,073;00:52:56,077;said they would.
785;00:52:58,093;00:53:01,056;Interesting thing
785;00:52:58,093;00:53:01,056;about my father--
786;00:53:01,056;00:53:03,047;he built our house up
786;00:53:01,056;00:53:03,047;from near ruin.
787;00:53:03,048;00:53:07,064;He built our army, he built
787;00:53:03,048;00:53:07,064;Casterly Rock as we know it,
788;00:53:07,064;00:53:09,072;but he didn't build the sewers.
789;00:53:09,073;00:53:11,081;That was beneath him,
790;00:53:11,081;00:53:14,068;so he gave the job to the
790;00:53:11,081;00:53:14,068;lowest person he could find--
791;00:53:14,068;00:53:16,023;me.
792;00:53:16,023;00:53:18,006;He was right, I was low.
793;00:53:18,006;00:53:20,018;The company I kept, low.
794;00:53:20,018;00:53:21,072;Women, mostly.
795;00:53:21,073;00:53:23,039;They weren't welcome
795;00:53:21,073;00:53:23,039;at the Rock.
796;00:53:23,039;00:53:25,068;Father disapproved
796;00:53:23,039;00:53:25,068;of that sort of behavior.
797;00:53:25,068;00:53:27,031;Couldn't walk them
797;00:53:25,068;00:53:27,031;through the front gates,
798;00:53:27,031;00:53:28,077;I couldn't have them
798;00:53:27,031;00:53:28,077;in my chambers,
799;00:53:28,077;00:53:31,002;so in the process
799;00:53:28,077;00:53:31,002;of building the sewers,
800;00:53:31,002;00:53:33,077;I threw in something for myself.
801;00:53:35,081;00:53:37,081;It was a passage that began
802;00:53:37,081;00:53:39,052;in an out of the way cove
802;00:53:37,081;00:53:39,052;by the sea
803;00:53:39,052;00:53:42,093;and ended beneath
803;00:53:39,052;00:53:42,093;one of the main guard towers.
804;00:53:42,093;00:53:46,014;No better place for low pursuits
804;00:53:42,093;00:53:46,014;than beneath the ground.
805;00:53:47,077;00:53:51,052;Casterly Rock
805;00:53:47,077;00:53:51,052;is an impregnable fortress.
806;00:53:53,077;00:53:57,043;But as a good friend of mine
806;00:53:53,077;00:53:57,043;once said,
807;00:53:57,043;00:54:01,039;Give me 10 good men
807;00:53:57,043;00:54:01,039;and I'll impregnate the bitch.
808;00:54:06,093;00:54:08,014;And so it begins.
809;00:54:14,089;00:54:17,077;They will face the bulk
809;00:54:14,089;00:54:17,077;of the Lannister forces.
810;00:54:17,077;00:54:19,064;They will be outnumbered.
811;00:54:19,064;00:54:21,098;They will have less armor
811;00:54:19,064;00:54:21,098;and fewer weapons.
812;00:54:26,093;00:54:30,072;But my sister's armies
812;00:54:26,093;00:54:30,072;fight for her out of fear.
813;00:54:30,073;00:54:33,068;The Unsullied will be fighting
813;00:54:30,073;00:54:33,068;for something greater.
814;00:54:33,068;00:54:35,068;They will be fighting
814;00:54:33,068;00:54:35,068;for freedom
815;00:54:35,068;00:54:37,047;and the person
815;00:54:35,068;00:54:37,047;who gave it to them.
816;00:54:37,048;00:54:39,098;They will be fighting for you.
817;00:54:39,098;00:54:42,043;And that is why
817;00:54:39,098;00:54:42,043;they will triumph.
818;00:54:58,043;00:55:00,018;_
819;00:55:01,064;00:55:03,085;_
820;00:55:05,004;00:55:06,066;_
821;00:55:29,018;00:55:30,039;Where are they?!
822;00:55:30,039;00:55:33,002;Where are the rest
822;00:55:30,039;00:55:33,002;of the Lannisters?
823;00:57:01,089;00:57:04,014;It's done.
823;00:57:01,089;00:57:04,014;It is.
824;00:57:06,002;00:57:10,014;And now the rains weep
824;00:57:06,002;00:57:10,014;o'er our halls.
825;00:57:12,048;00:57:13,093;Did we fight well?
826;00:57:13,093;00:57:16,098;Uh, as well
826;00:57:13,093;00:57:16,098;as could be expected.
827;00:57:16,098;00:57:19,010;It was never our forte.
828;00:57:19,010;00:57:21,018;Golden roses, indeed.
829;00:57:23,010;00:57:25,014;Your brother and his new queen
830;00:57:25,014;00:57:28,006;thought you would be
830;00:57:25,014;00:57:28,006;defending Casterly Rock.
831;00:57:28,006;00:57:31,035;The truth is Casterly Rock
831;00:57:28,006;00:57:31,035;isn't worth much anymore.
832;00:57:31,035;00:57:32,093;Well, it is to me,
833;00:57:32,093;00:57:35,027;but my fond childhood memories
834;00:57:35,027;00:57:36,081;won't keep Cersei on the throne.
835;00:57:36,081;00:57:38,093;So you just let them take it?
836;00:57:38,093;00:57:40,098;For now. They won't
836;00:57:38,093;00:57:40,098;be able to hold it.
837;00:57:40,098;00:57:43,052;Euron Greyjoy's navy
837;00:57:40,098;00:57:43,052;burned their ships,
838;00:57:43,052;00:57:45,052;we emptied the larders
838;00:57:43,052;00:57:45,052;before we left.
839;00:57:45,052;00:57:47,077;Eventually, they'll be forced
839;00:57:45,052;00:57:47,077;to abandon their position
840;00:57:47,077;00:57:51,018;and march all the way
840;00:57:47,077;00:57:51,018;across Westeros.
841;00:57:51,018;00:57:54,035;And you took your army,
841;00:57:51,018;00:57:54,035;your real army,
842;00:57:54,035;00:57:56,023;and went where they weren't.
843;00:57:56,023;00:57:59,056;As Robb Stark did to me
843;00:57:56,023;00:57:59,056;at Whispering Wood.
844;00:57:59,056;00:58:01,060;There are always
844;00:57:59,056;00:58:01,060;lessons in failures.
845;00:58:01,060;00:58:05,018;Yes. You must be
845;00:58:01,060;00:58:05,018;very wise by now.
846;00:58:06,048;00:58:09,035;My father always said
846;00:58:06,048;00:58:09,035;I was a slow learner.
847;00:58:09,035;00:58:11,010;If he was so clever,
848;00:58:11,010;00:58:12,085;why didn't he take Highgarden
849;00:58:12,085;00:58:16,056;the moment your
849;00:58:12,085;00:58:16,056;gold mines ran dry?
850;00:58:18,010;00:58:22,002;I suppose I'll be able to
850;00:58:18,010;00:58:22,002;ask him myself soon enough.
851;00:58:22,002;00:58:25,010;No more learning
851;00:58:22,002;00:58:25,010;from my mistakes, eh?
852;00:58:27,056;00:58:30,006;How will you do it?
853;00:58:30,006;00:58:32,052;With that sword?
854;00:58:32,052;00:58:34,089;That was Joffrey's sword,
854;00:58:32,052;00:58:34,089;wasn't it?
855;00:58:34,089;00:58:37,023;Not that he ever used it.
856;00:58:37,023;00:58:38,089;What did he call it?
857;00:58:40,052;00:58:42,085;Widow's Wail.
858;00:58:42,085;00:58:45,006;He really was a cunt, wasn't he?
859;00:58:46,068;00:58:52,006;I did unspeakable things
859;00:58:46,068;00:58:52,006;to protect my family.
860;00:58:52,006;00:58:56,010;Or watched them
860;00:58:52,006;00:58:56,010;being done on my orders.
861;00:58:56,010;00:58:59,027;I never lost
861;00:58:56,010;00:58:59,027;a night's sleep over them.
862;00:58:59,027;00:59:01,031;They were necessary.
863;00:59:01,031;00:59:03,035;And whatever
863;00:59:01,031;00:59:03,035;I imagined necessary
864;00:59:03,035;00:59:07,027;for the safety
864;00:59:03,035;00:59:07,027;of House Tyrell, I did.
865;00:59:07,027;00:59:11,089;But your sister
865;00:59:07,027;00:59:11,089;has done things...
866;00:59:13,056;00:59:15,089;I was incapable of imagining.
867;00:59:15,089;00:59:18,072;That was
867;00:59:15,089;00:59:18,072;my prize mistake--
868;00:59:18,073;00:59:21,027;a failure of imagination.
869;00:59:22,060;00:59:25,006;She's a monster,
869;00:59:22,060;00:59:25,006;you do know that?
870;00:59:25,006;00:59:27,023;To you, I'm sure.
871;00:59:27,023;00:59:29,010;To others as well.
872;00:59:29,010;00:59:32,060;But after we've won and there's
872;00:59:29,010;00:59:32,060;no one left to oppose us,
873;00:59:32,060;00:59:36,093;when people are living peacefully
873;00:59:32,060;00:59:36,093;in the world she built,
874;00:59:36,093;00:59:40,064;do you really think they'll wring their
874;00:59:36,093;00:59:40,064;hands over the way she built it?
875;00:59:43,006;00:59:45,027;You love her.
876;00:59:45,027;00:59:47,006;You really do love her.
877;00:59:47,006;00:59:49,052;You poor fool.
878;00:59:49,052;00:59:51,027;She'll be the end of you.
879;00:59:51,027;00:59:53,081;Possibly.
880;00:59:53,081;00:59:55,060;Not much to be gained
881;00:59:55,060;00:59:57,064;from discussing it with
881;00:59:55,060;00:59:57,064;you, though, is there?
882;00:59:57,064;01:00:00,035;What better person
882;00:59:57,064;01:00:00,035;to discuss it with?
883;01:00:00,035;01:00:02,027;What better guarantee
883;01:00:00,035;01:00:02,027;could you have
884;01:00:02,027;01:00:06,031;that the things you say
884;01:00:02,027;01:00:06,031;will never leave this room?
885;01:00:06,031;01:00:09,035;But perhaps you're right.
886;01:00:09,035;01:00:10,093;If she's driven you this far,
887;01:00:10,093;01:00:13,035;it's gone beyond your control.
888;01:00:14,064;01:00:16,064;Yes.
889;01:00:16,064;01:00:18,010;It has.
890;01:00:19,018;01:00:21,023;She's a disease.
891;01:00:21,023;01:00:24,018;I regret my role
891;01:00:21,023;01:00:24,018;in spreading it.
892;01:00:24,018;01:00:25,077;You will, too.
893;01:00:25,077;01:00:27,052;I think we're done here.
894;01:00:30,093;01:00:31,098;How will it happen?
895;01:00:33,052;01:00:35,043;Cersei had several ideas.
896;01:00:35,043;01:00:36,085;Whipping you through the streets
897;01:00:36,085;01:00:39,052;and beheading you
897;01:00:36,085;01:00:39,052;in front of the Red Keep.
898;01:00:39,052;01:00:43,035;Flaying you alive and hanging you
898;01:00:39,052;01:00:43,035;from the walls of King's Landing.
899;01:00:46,052;01:00:48,031;I talked her out of those.
900;01:01:05,056;01:01:06,098;Will there be pain?
901;01:01:06,098;01:01:09,056;No. I made sure
901;01:01:06,098;01:01:09,056;of that.
902;01:01:09,056;01:01:10,089;That's good.
903;01:01:23,068;01:01:25,068;I'd hate to die like your son.
904;01:01:26,089;01:01:28,035;Clawing at my neck,
905;01:01:28,035;01:01:31,023;foam and bile spilling
905;01:01:28,035;01:01:31,023;from my mouth,
906;01:01:31,023;01:01:35,006;eyes bloodred, skin purple.
907;01:01:35,006;01:01:37,043;Must have been horrible for you,
908;01:01:37,043;01:01:40,089;as a Kingsguard, as a father.
909;01:01:40,089;01:01:43,047;It was horrible enough for me.
910;01:01:43,048;01:01:46,014;A shocking scene.
911;01:01:46,014;01:01:48,093;Not at all what I intended.
912;01:01:50,089;01:01:55,048;You see, I had never seen
912;01:01:50,089;01:01:55,048;the poison work before.
913;01:02:00,043;01:02:02,060;Tell Cersei.
914;01:02:02,060;01:02:05,006;I want her to know it was me.
915;01:02:20,068;01:02:31,031;
915;01:02:20,068;01:02:31,031;9999
915;01:02:20,068;01:02:31,031;00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
