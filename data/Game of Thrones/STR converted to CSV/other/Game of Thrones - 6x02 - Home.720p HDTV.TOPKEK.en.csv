1;00:02:40,780;00:02:44,114;Give him another go, Ned.
2;00:02:44,199;00:02:46,116;That's my father.
3;00:02:46,251;00:02:48,450;And my Uncle Benjen.
4;00:02:48,536;00:02:51,620;Keep your shield up or I'll
4;00:02:48,536;00:02:51,620;ring your head like a bell.
5;00:02:59,962;00:03:02,128;They were all so happy.
6;00:03:03,381;00:03:05,213;So were you once.
7;00:03:10,353;00:03:13,770;Stop showing off.
8;00:03:13,855;00:03:15,438;Lyanna!
9;00:03:15,523;00:03:17,223;My Aunt Lyanna.
10;00:03:17,308;00:03:19,725;I've seen her statue in the crypt.
11;00:03:19,810;00:03:23,227;My father never talked about her.
12;00:03:29,034;00:03:31,817;Would you get out of here?
12;00:03:29,034;00:03:31,817;We're sparring.
13;00:03:31,902;00:03:36,070;Who are you gonna spar with
13;00:03:31,902;00:03:36,070;when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?
14;00:03:36,156;00:03:37,238;I don't know.
15;00:03:37,323;00:03:38,906;What about him?
16;00:03:40,325;00:03:42,542;Wylis, come here.
17;00:03:47,882;00:03:49,798;Hodor?
18;00:03:49,883;00:03:51,883;But he's got giant's blood.
19;00:03:52,002;00:03:55,502;And you've got training. Sounds
19;00:03:52,002;00:03:55,502;like a fair match to me.
20;00:03:55,638;00:03:58,221;Benjen always lifts his chin
20;00:03:55,638;00:03:58,221;when he's about to charge.
21;00:03:58,339;00:04:01,090;And lowers it when he's
21;00:03:58,339;00:04:01,090;going to dodge, my lady.
22;00:04:01,176;00:04:03,258;Hodor talks?
23;00:04:08,514;00:04:11,481;You leave the fighting
23;00:04:08,514;00:04:11,481;to the little lords, Wylis.
24;00:04:11,566;00:04:14,017;Come along, now.
24;00:04:11,566;00:04:14,017;It's no place for you.
25;00:04:14,152;00:04:16,652;Oh, Nan, look at the size of him.
26;00:04:16,737;00:04:19,021;If he ever learned to
26;00:04:16,737;00:04:19,021;fight, he'd be unstoppable.
27;00:04:19,106;00:04:22,106;Well, he's never going to learn to
27;00:04:19,106;00:04:22,106;fight because he's a stable boy.
28;00:04:22,192;00:04:24,024;So leave him be.
29;00:04:24,159;00:04:26,410;It is time to go.
30;00:04:26,528;00:04:28,527;Please, a little longer.
31;00:04:41,290;00:04:44,290;You finally show me
31;00:04:41,290;00:04:44,290;something I care about
32;00:04:44,375;00:04:45,874;and then you drag me away.
33;00:04:46,009;00:04:49,678;It is beautiful beneath the sea,
34;00:04:49,763;00:04:52,046;but if you stay too long,
34;00:04:49,763;00:04:52,046;you'll drown.
35;00:04:52,131;00:04:56,216;I wasn't drowning.
35;00:04:52,131;00:04:56,216;I was home.
36;00:05:09,361;00:05:11,561;Wylis.
37;00:05:11,647;00:05:13,312;Hodor.
38;00:05:13,397;00:05:15,114;I saw you as a boy.
39;00:05:15,233;00:05:18,066;You could talk.
40;00:05:18,151;00:05:20,735;What happened?
41;00:05:20,821;00:05:22,703;Hodor.
42;00:05:27,158;00:05:28,658;Where's Meera?
43;00:05:30,911;00:05:32,794;Hodor.
44;00:05:58,983;00:06:00,598;You shouldn't be here.
45;00:06:00,684;00:06:03,401;It's not safe outside the cave.
46;00:06:03,487;00:06:05,185;It's not safe anywhere.
47;00:06:08,607;00:06:10,907;I saw that Hodor wasn't always Hodor.
48;00:06:10,992;00:06:13,109;- Hodor.
48;00:06:10,992;00:06:13,109;His real name is Wylis.
49;00:06:13,194;00:06:17,329;And he could talk and
49;00:06:13,194;00:06:17,329;fight and-- and then--
50;00:06:18,447;00:06:19,663;What's wrong?
51;00:06:22,951;00:06:25,785;The Three-Eyed Raven
51;00:06:22,951;00:06:25,785;says there's a war coming.
52;00:06:25,921;00:06:28,086;And we're going to fight it in there?
53;00:06:57,561;00:06:59,644;Brandon Stark needs you.
54;00:07:02,615;00:07:04,698;For what?
54;00:07:02,615;00:07:04,698;I sit in there
55;00:07:04,817;00:07:07,116;and I watch him have his visions
55;00:07:04,817;00:07:07,116;and nothing ever happens.
56;00:07:07,202;00:07:09,786;He isn't going to stay here forever.
57;00:07:09,871;00:07:13,322;And out there he needs you.
58;00:07:39,060;00:07:41,977;It's time, Ser Davos.
59;00:07:42,062;00:07:44,396;Open the door and the men inside
60;00:07:44,514;00:07:46,764;can rejoin their brothers in peace.
61;00:07:52,187;00:07:56,822;We'll even set the wolf free north
61;00:07:52,187;00:07:56,822;of the Wall where it belongs.
62;00:08:00,193;00:08:02,443;Nobody needs to die tonight.
63;00:08:06,248;00:08:08,497;I've never been much of a fighter.
64;00:08:15,672;00:08:17,838;Apologies for what
64;00:08:15,672;00:08:17,838;you're about to see.
65;00:08:25,379;00:08:26,845;Come on.
66;00:09:13,582;00:09:15,082;Attack!
67;00:09:23,257;00:09:25,140;Fight, you cowards!
68;00:09:57,366;00:09:59,450;You fucking traitor.
69;00:09:59,535;00:10:01,617;The only traitors here are the ones
70;00:10:01,753;00:10:04,704;who shoved their knives into
70;00:10:01,753;00:10:04,704;their Lord Commander's heart.
71;00:10:04,789;00:10:08,290;For thousands of years
71;00:10:04,789;00:10:08,290;the Night's Watch
72;00:10:08,375;00:10:11,008;has held Castle Black
72;00:10:08,375;00:10:11,008;against the wildlings.
73;00:10:11,127;00:10:13,127;Until you.
74;00:10:22,970;00:10:26,137;Throw them into the cells
74;00:10:22,970;00:10:26,137;where they belong.
75;00:10:58,464;00:11:01,247;Took a lot of knives.
76;00:11:04,385;00:11:07,002;I'll have my men
76;00:11:04,385;00:11:07,002;get the wood for a fire.
77;00:11:08,254;00:11:09,804;Bodies to burn.
78;00:11:17,595;00:11:20,812;Shh, hey.
79;00:11:20,897;00:11:24,432;Right, so there she is,
79;00:11:20,897;00:11:24,432;high and mighty Queen Cersei,
80;00:11:24,518;00:11:26,683;tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.
81;00:11:26,769;00:11:29,769;All of a sudden she looks my way.
82;00:11:29,854;00:11:32,739;Gives me a little smile
82;00:11:29,854;00:11:32,739;like, Well?
83;00:11:32,857;00:11:35,273;So, all right, you know,
83;00:11:32,857;00:11:35,273;I've never been shy
84;00:11:35,359;00:11:38,026;and I'm blessed down south,
84;00:11:35,359;00:11:38,026;so I put it right out.
85;00:11:38,161;00:11:41,028;She's never seen anything like it.
86;00:11:41,114;00:11:43,496;I mean, she's used to her
86;00:11:41,114;00:11:43,496;brother and from what I hear,
87;00:11:43,582;00:11:45,782;Jaime Lannister's half
87;00:11:43,582;00:11:45,782;an inch shy of an inch.
88;00:11:45,867;00:11:47,616;Ooh!
89;00:11:47,701;00:11:51,669;She sees it and I swear to
89;00:11:47,701;00:11:51,669;the gods she licks her lips.
90;00:11:52,789;00:11:54,372;Well, you all know me.
91;00:11:54,457;00:11:56,506;You know I wouldn't lie about this.
92;00:13:14,519;00:13:15,818;Get out of my way.
93;00:13:15,936;00:13:17,903;King's orders, Your Grace.
94;00:13:21,157;00:13:22,740;What are the king's orders?
95;00:13:22,826;00:13:25,609;He would like you to remain
95;00:13:22,826;00:13:25,609;in the Red Keep, Your Grace,
96;00:13:25,744;00:13:26,993;for your own protection.
97;00:13:28,946;00:13:31,614;You're barring me from attending
97;00:13:28,946;00:13:31,614;my own daughter's funeral?
98;00:13:31,699;00:13:35,750;Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king's
98;00:13:31,699;00:13:35,750;command, I cannot let you pass.
99;00:13:37,336;00:13:39,419;I would like to speak to my son.
100;00:13:39,505;00:13:41,954;He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace.
101;00:14:12,063;00:14:14,396;She grew up.
102;00:14:14,482;00:14:16,481;Almost.
103;00:14:16,616;00:14:19,234;Have we caught Prince
103;00:14:16,616;00:14:19,234;Trystane's killers?
104;00:14:21,620;00:14:23,737;I expect it was Mother.
105;00:14:23,822;00:14:25,821;Your mother wouldn't do that.
106;00:14:25,907;00:14:27,240;Yes, she would.
107;00:14:29,743;00:14:32,410;Are you angry with her?
108;00:14:32,496;00:14:35,412;Of course not.
108;00:14:32,496;00:14:35,412;Then why didn't you let her come?
109;00:14:35,498;00:14:38,214;She has every right to be here.
110;00:14:38,333;00:14:42,834;They told me she wouldn't
110;00:14:38,333;00:14:42,834;be allowed in the sept.
111;00:14:42,970;00:14:44,721;If she had tried--
112;00:14:44,841;00:14:46,730;They're not putting
112;00:14:44,841;00:14:46,730;your mother in a cell ever again.
113;00:14:47,257;00:14:49,223;Not while I'm here.
114;00:14:51,810;00:14:54,227;Why haven't you gone to see her?
115;00:14:57,932;00:15:00,265;Everything she endured,
115;00:14:57,932;00:15:00,265;she did it for you.
116;00:15:00,350;00:15:02,734;Don't you think I know that?
117;00:15:06,689;00:15:08,488;I'm sorry.
118;00:15:10,491;00:15:12,325;But I can't.
119;00:15:12,410;00:15:13,775;Why not?
120;00:15:15,195;00:15:18,779;When the Faith Militant
120;00:15:15,195;00:15:18,779;seized her and Margaery,
121;00:15:18,864;00:15:20,748;what did I do?
122;00:15:22,284;00:15:26,035;When they paraded her through
122;00:15:22,284;00:15:26,035;the streets like a whore,
123;00:15:26,121;00:15:27,920;what did I do?
124;00:15:29,039;00:15:31,372;We all fail sometimes.
125;00:15:31,507;00:15:34,875;The king is supposed to be
125;00:15:31,507;00:15:34,875;the Protector of the Realm.
126;00:15:34,960;00:15:38,428;If I can't even protect my
126;00:15:34,960;00:15:38,428;own wife or my own mother,
127;00:15:38,547;00:15:40,212;what good am I?
128;00:15:40,348;00:15:43,382;Go and see your mother
128;00:15:40,348;00:15:43,382;and ask her to forgive you.
129;00:15:45,852;00:15:48,052;Your Grace.
130;00:15:48,137;00:15:49,853;Lord Commander.
131;00:15:49,939;00:15:52,688;I want to see my wife.
132;00:15:52,774;00:15:55,107;The gods wait for Queen Margaery
133;00:15:55,226;00:15:58,610;to confess her crimes
133;00:15:55,226;00:15:58,610;and seek their mercy.
134;00:15:58,729;00:16:01,645;The king must wait as well.
135;00:16:01,731;00:16:04,198;Go and see your mother, Tommen.
136;00:16:14,574;00:16:16,574;You're a bold man.
137;00:16:18,244;00:16:19,793;On the contrary.
138;00:16:19,911;00:16:22,495;I fear a great deal.
139;00:16:22,581;00:16:25,748;The Father, the Mother,
140;00:16:25,883;00:16:27,999;the Warrior.
141;00:16:37,976;00:16:41,142;Do you know why we use these stones?
142;00:16:42,813;00:16:45,729;To remind us not to fear death.
143;00:16:45,815;00:16:49,099;We close our eyes on this world
143;00:16:45,815;00:16:49,099;and open them on the next.
144;00:16:49,185;00:16:51,434;You must long for the next life.
145;00:16:53,438;00:16:54,936;In truth, I fear that, too.
146;00:16:55,072;00:16:57,990;You imprisoned
146;00:16:55,072;00:16:57,990;and humiliated my sister.
147;00:16:58,108;00:17:00,741;Your sister sought the gods' mercy
148;00:17:00,827;00:17:02,610;and atoned for her sin.
149;00:17:02,694;00:17:04,911;What about my sins?
150;00:17:07,198;00:17:10,699;I broke a sacred oath and
150;00:17:07,198;00:17:10,699;stabbed my king in the back.
151;00:17:12,585;00:17:15,003;I killed my own cousin.
152;00:17:15,121;00:17:17,037;When the gods judged
152;00:17:15,121;00:17:17,037;my brother guilty,
153;00:17:17,122;00:17:19,456;I helped him escape their justice.
154;00:17:21,009;00:17:23,709;What atonement do I deserve?
155;00:17:26,096;00:17:28,346;You would spill blood
155;00:17:26,096;00:17:28,346;in this holy place?
156;00:17:28,465;00:17:30,881;Oh, the gods won't mind.
157;00:17:30,966;00:17:33,433;They've spilled more blood
157;00:17:30,966;00:17:33,433;than the rest of us combined.
158;00:17:35,387;00:17:37,553;Go on, then.
159;00:17:37,639;00:17:41,273;I deserve it.
159;00:17:37,639;00:17:41,273;We all do.
160;00:17:41,358;00:17:43,974;We are weak, vain creatures.
161;00:17:44,060;00:17:46,943;We live only by the Mother's mercy.
162;00:18:02,241;00:18:05,241;They should be closer if you
162;00:18:02,241;00:18:05,241;mean for them to save you.
163;00:18:05,326;00:18:07,209;I don't.
164;00:18:07,328;00:18:10,211;They'd never reach me
164;00:18:07,328;00:18:10,211;before you struck.
165;00:18:10,330;00:18:11,996;I've fought against worse odds.
166;00:18:12,082;00:18:15,049;No doubt many of us would fall.
167;00:18:15,167;00:18:18,167;But who are we, hmm?
168;00:18:18,303;00:18:20,970;We have no names, no family.
169;00:18:21,056;00:18:24,973;Every one of us
169;00:18:21,056;00:18:24,973;is poor and powerless.
170;00:18:25,059;00:18:27,475;And yet together,
171;00:18:27,560;00:18:30,227;we can overthrow an empire.
172;00:19:00,536;00:19:02,118;Mother.
173;00:19:13,796;00:19:16,513;Did they put her in the
173;00:19:13,796;00:19:16,513;red gown or the gold?
174;00:19:18,049;00:19:19,715;Gold.
175;00:19:19,850;00:19:22,301;Good. It was always her color.
176;00:19:24,637;00:19:27,854;I'm sorry for keeping you here.
177;00:19:30,225;00:19:32,608;I shouldn't have,
177;00:19:30,225;00:19:32,608;but I was--
178;00:19:35,229;00:19:38,446;I didn't want to lose you again.
179;00:19:38,565;00:19:40,365;I understand.
180;00:19:42,568;00:19:44,368;I'm glad to see you.
181;00:19:47,572;00:19:50,071;I know I should have come sooner.
182;00:19:50,207;00:19:53,542;I wanted to.
182;00:19:50,207;00:19:53,542;I was wrong.
183;00:19:54,911;00:19:56,827;It's all right.
184;00:19:59,581;00:20:01,831;No, it isn't.
185;00:20:03,584;00:20:06,251;I should have executed all of them.
186;00:20:06,387;00:20:08,169;I should have pulled down the sept
187;00:20:08,254;00:20:12,339;onto the High Sparrow's head
187;00:20:08,254;00:20:12,339;before I let them do that to you,
188;00:20:12,424;00:20:14,758;as you would have for me.
189;00:20:15,893;00:20:18,427;You raised me to be strong...
190;00:20:20,597;00:20:22,180;and I wasn't.
191;00:20:23,567;00:20:25,649;But I want to be.
192;00:20:28,270;00:20:30,069;Help me.
193;00:20:34,441;00:20:36,107;Always.
194;00:21:04,347;00:21:07,015;If I lost my cock,
194;00:21:04,347;00:21:07,015;I'd drink all the time.
195;00:21:11,136;00:21:13,469;Meaning no offense.
196;00:21:13,605;00:21:16,389;He makes dwarf jokes,
196;00:21:13,605;00:21:16,389;I make eunuch jokes.
197;00:21:16,474;00:21:17,772;I do not make dwarf jokes.
198;00:21:17,858;00:21:19,975;You think them.
199;00:21:20,060;00:21:24,478;So, the fleet.
199;00:21:20,060;00:21:24,478;It's been burned.
200;00:21:24,614;00:21:28,398;We are searching for the men who burned
200;00:21:24,614;00:21:28,398;the ships, but nobody saw anything.
201;00:21:28,483;00:21:30,949;Surely there's some good
201;00:21:28,483;00:21:30,949;news lurking somewhere.
202;00:21:31,035;00:21:34,119;Astapor and Yunkai have
202;00:21:31,035;00:21:34,119;stopped asking us for aid.
203;00:21:34,205;00:21:36,821;Perhaps they can
203;00:21:34,205;00:21:36,821;tell us their secret.
204;00:21:36,956;00:21:39,406;The Masters have retaken both cities.
205;00:21:39,491;00:21:44,159;Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's
205;00:21:39,491;00:21:44,159;Bay has returned to the slavers.
206;00:21:46,130;00:21:50,215;What about the dragons? We have two
206;00:21:46,130;00:21:50,215;of them here beneath the pyramid.
207;00:21:50,333;00:21:52,050;They are not eating.
208;00:21:52,167;00:21:54,918;They haven't touched any food
208;00:21:52,167;00:21:54,918;since Queen Daenerys left.
209;00:21:55,004;00:21:57,720;Daenerys is the dragon queen.
210;00:21:57,839;00:22:00,673;Can't very well let the dragons
210;00:21:57,839;00:22:00,673;starve, that's obvious.
211;00:22:00,758;00:22:04,092;If a dragon does not want to eat,
211;00:22:00,758;00:22:04,092;how do you force him to eat?
212;00:22:04,177;00:22:06,477;Dragons do not do well in captivity.
213;00:22:06,562;00:22:08,929;How do you know this?
213;00:22:06,562;00:22:08,929;That's what I do.
214;00:22:09,015;00:22:11,981;I drink and I know things.
215;00:22:14,019;00:22:17,185;The dragons Aegon used
215;00:22:14,019;00:22:17,185;to conquer Westeros
216;00:22:17,271;00:22:19,770;ranged over hundreds of miles.
217;00:22:19,856;00:22:21,656;Then Daenerys's ancestors
218;00:22:21,741;00:22:24,574;started chaining them up in pens.
219;00:22:24,693;00:22:26,660;A few generations later,
220;00:22:26,745;00:22:30,412;the last dragons
220;00:22:26,745;00:22:30,412;were no larger than cats.
221;00:22:30,531;00:22:33,448;They must be unchained
221;00:22:30,531;00:22:33,448;or they'll waste away.
222;00:22:35,035;00:22:37,000;Missandei,
223;00:22:37,086;00:22:40,620;how many times were you in the
223;00:22:37,086;00:22:40,620;company of these dragons?
224;00:22:40,705;00:22:44,373;Many times.
224;00:22:40,705;00:22:44,373;And did they ever harm you?
225;00:22:44,509;00:22:46,508;Never.
226;00:22:46,593;00:22:48,760;Dragons are intelligent.
227;00:22:48,879;00:22:51,712;More intelligent than men
227;00:22:48,879;00:22:51,712;according to some maesters.
228;00:22:51,797;00:22:54,130;They have affection for their friends
229;00:22:54,215;00:22:56,049;and fury for their enemies.
230;00:22:57,719;00:23:00,218;I am their friend.
230;00:22:57,719;00:23:00,218;Do they know that?
231;00:23:00,354;00:23:03,387;They will. It's time
231;00:23:00,354;00:23:03,387;they had their supper.
232;00:24:34,376;00:24:36,676;I'm friends with your mother.
233;00:24:43,516;00:24:46,134;I'm here to help.
234;00:24:46,269;00:24:48,301;Don't eat the help.
235;00:24:53,107;00:24:54,473;When I was a child,
236;00:24:54,609;00:24:58,226;an uncle asked what gift
236;00:24:54,609;00:24:58,226;I wanted for my name day.
237;00:24:58,311;00:25:00,944;I begged him for one of you.
238;00:25:01,030;00:25:04,531;It wouldn't even have to be
238;00:25:01,030;00:25:04,531;a big dragon, I told him.
239;00:25:06,401;00:25:08,618;It could be little
239;00:25:06,401;00:25:08,618;like me.
240;00:25:15,324;00:25:19,459;Everyone laughed like it was the
240;00:25:15,324;00:25:19,459;funniest thing they had ever heard.
241;00:25:20,796;00:25:22,995;Then my father told me
242;00:25:23,080;00:25:26,999;the last dragon had died
242;00:25:23,080;00:25:26,999;a century ago.
243;00:25:27,133;00:25:30,218;I cried myself to sleep that night.
244;00:25:39,260;00:25:41,226;But here you are.
245;00:26:48,230;00:26:51,363;Next time I have an idea like that,
246;00:26:51,449;00:26:53,232;punch me in the face.
247;00:27:07,245;00:27:09,077;What's your name?
248;00:27:15,551;00:27:17,583;What's your name?
249;00:27:17,719;00:27:21,086;No one.
249;00:27:17,719;00:27:21,086;I don't believe that.
250;00:27:21,171;00:27:23,922;You don't believe that.
251;00:27:54,948;00:27:57,331;Who are you?
252;00:27:58,951;00:27:59,951;No one.
253;00:28:00,085;00:28:02,451;If a girl says her name,
254;00:28:02,587;00:28:05,587;a man will let her sleep
254;00:28:02,587;00:28:05,587;under a roof tonight.
255;00:28:05,672;00:28:07,956;A girl has no name.
256;00:28:08,091;00:28:10,291;If a girl says her name,
257;00:28:10,426;00:28:12,459;a man will feed her tonight.
258;00:28:12,595;00:28:15,011;A girl has no name.
259;00:28:16,381;00:28:18,096;If a girl says her name,
260;00:28:18,182;00:28:20,516;a man will give her eyes back.
261;00:28:22,269;00:28:24,519;A girl has no name.
262;00:28:32,109;00:28:34,226;Come.
263;00:28:42,568;00:28:44,483;Leave it.
264;00:28:44,569;00:28:47,653;A girl is not a beggar anymore.
265;00:28:56,078;00:28:58,912;We came upon the bodies
265;00:28:56,078;00:28:58,912;on our way here.
266;00:29:00,332;00:29:03,498;Half a dozen men?
266;00:29:00,332;00:29:03,498;Your best hunters?
267;00:29:03,634;00:29:05,300;They obviously had help.
268;00:29:05,386;00:29:08,302;I didn't think Lady Sansa
268;00:29:05,386;00:29:08,302;killed them all by herself.
269;00:29:09,556;00:29:11,838;Thank you for this report,
269;00:29:09,556;00:29:11,838;Lord Karstark.
270;00:29:11,974;00:29:14,341;We know where she's going.
271;00:29:14,426;00:29:16,175;Her brother's at Castle Black.
272;00:29:16,260;00:29:17,977;Ned Stark's last surviving son?
273;00:29:18,062;00:29:20,144;Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.
274;00:29:20,230;00:29:23,314;So was I, Father.
275;00:29:23,400;00:29:25,482;Your hold on the North
275;00:29:23,400;00:29:25,482;will never be secure
276;00:29:25,568;00:29:27,851;as long as a Stark
276;00:29:25,568;00:29:27,851;can walk through that door.
277;00:29:27,937;00:29:30,519;Castle Black isn't defended
277;00:29:27,937;00:29:30,519;on the southern side.
278;00:29:30,655;00:29:34,522;And the few men left are barely men at all.
278;00:29:30,655;00:29:34,522;Farm boys and thieves.
279;00:29:34,608;00:29:38,525;With a small force, we could storm
279;00:29:34,608;00:29:38,525;the castle, kill Jon Snow--
280;00:29:38,661;00:29:41,578;Murder the Lord Commander
280;00:29:38,661;00:29:41,578;of the Night's Watch?
281;00:29:41,696;00:29:44,364;You'd unite every house
281;00:29:41,696;00:29:44,364;in the North against us.
282;00:29:46,083;00:29:48,116;We don't need
282;00:29:46,083;00:29:48,116;every house in the North.
283;00:29:48,202;00:29:50,835;The Umbers, the Manderlys,
283;00:29:48,202;00:29:50,835;and the Karstarks
284;00:29:50,920;00:29:54,788;command more soldiers than all
284;00:29:50,920;00:29:54,788;the other houses combined.
285;00:29:54,873;00:29:57,841;With their support,
285;00:29:54,873;00:29:57,841;none could challenge us.
286;00:29:57,926;00:30:01,927;The Starks lost my house the day
286;00:29:57,926;00:30:01,927;King Robb cut off my father's head.
287;00:30:02,046;00:30:05,013;It's time for new blood in the North.
288;00:30:14,055;00:30:16,805;If you acquire a
288;00:30:14,055;00:30:16,805;reputation as a mad dog,
289;00:30:16,890;00:30:18,723;you'll be treated as a mad dog.
290;00:30:18,809;00:30:21,692;Taken out back and
290;00:30:18,809;00:30:21,692;slaughtered for pig feed.
291;00:30:23,062;00:30:24,945;My lords.
292;00:30:25,064;00:30:27,397;Lady Walda has given birth.
293;00:30:27,532;00:30:29,482;A boy.
294;00:30:29,567;00:30:32,067;Red-cheeked
294;00:30:29,567;00:30:32,067;and healthy.
295;00:30:32,202;00:30:35,403;My congratulations, Lord Bolton.
296;00:30:44,629;00:30:46,495;Congratulations, Father.
297;00:30:47,998;00:30:50,748;I look forward to meeting
297;00:30:47,998;00:30:50,748;my new brother.
298;00:30:55,170;00:30:57,637;You'll always be my firstborn.
299;00:30:59,090;00:31:01,389;Thank you for saying that.
300;00:31:01,475;00:31:03,725;It means a great deal to me.
301;00:31:40,204;00:31:42,455;Maester Wolkan,
302;00:31:42,590;00:31:46,424;send ravens to all the northern houses.
302;00:31:42,590;00:31:46,424;Roose Bolton is dead.
303;00:31:48,095;00:31:50,260;Poisoned by our enemies.
304;00:31:56,634;00:31:58,633;How did he die?
305;00:32:02,305;00:32:04,972;Poisoned by his enemies.
306;00:32:05,108;00:32:07,974;You're talking to your lord.
306;00:32:05,108;00:32:07,974;Use respect.
307;00:32:09,478;00:32:11,226;Forgive me, my lord.
308;00:32:14,482;00:32:16,447;Send for Lady Walda and the baby.
309;00:32:18,034;00:32:20,033;She's resting, my lord.
310;00:32:23,405;00:32:25,454;At once, my lord.
311;00:32:50,425;00:32:52,308;There he is.
312;00:32:52,394;00:32:54,344;Isn't he wonderful?
313;00:32:58,015;00:32:59,814;May I hold him?
314;00:33:01,151;00:33:03,233;Of-- of course.
315;00:33:13,276;00:33:15,243;Little brother.
316;00:33:16,362;00:33:18,278;Lord Bolton sent for us.
317;00:33:18,364;00:33:20,030;Have you seen him?
318;00:33:28,589;00:33:31,789;Of course.
318;00:33:28,589;00:33:31,789;Follow me, Mother.
319;00:33:49,271;00:33:51,221;Where is Lord Bolton?
320;00:34:01,397;00:34:03,230;Down!
321;00:34:03,365;00:34:06,232;It's all right. Come on, shh.
322;00:34:06,367;00:34:09,785;It's cold out here, Ramsay.
322;00:34:06,367;00:34:09,785;I need to feed him.
323;00:34:15,908;00:34:19,042;Ramsay, where is your father?
324;00:34:20,378;00:34:22,045;Ramsay.
325;00:34:29,836;00:34:32,052;Where is Lord Bolton?
326;00:34:38,593;00:34:40,642;I am Lord Bolton.
327;00:34:50,518;00:34:52,652;Ramsay.
328;00:34:52,770;00:34:54,436;Ramsay, please.
329;00:34:54,571;00:34:57,155;I'll leave Winterfell.
329;00:34:54,571;00:34:57,155;I'll go back to the Riverlands.
330;00:35:02,611;00:35:04,527;Please.
331;00:35:04,613;00:35:06,612;Ramsay.
332;00:35:08,499;00:35:10,331;He's your brother.
333;00:35:13,286;00:35:15,785;I prefer being an only child.
334;00:35:36,104;00:35:38,970;I saw her with a man.
335;00:35:39,106;00:35:40,939;I don't think he hurt her.
336;00:35:41,024;00:35:44,141;She didn't want to leave him,
336;00:35:41,024;00:35:44,141;he didn't want to leave her.
337;00:35:46,278;00:35:48,111;You don't know which way she went?
338;00:35:48,196;00:35:50,479;I spent three days looking for her.
339;00:35:50,564;00:35:52,030;She disappeared.
340;00:35:54,400;00:35:55,867;How'd she look?
341;00:35:55,985;00:35:58,152;She looked good.
342;00:35:58,238;00:36:01,204;She wasn't exactly
342;00:35:58,238;00:36:01,204;dressed like a lady.
343;00:36:02,624;00:36:04,240;No, she wouldn't be.
344;00:36:06,410;00:36:08,326;What happened at Winterfell?
345;00:36:20,004;00:36:23,588;I should have gone with you
345;00:36:20,004;00:36:23,588;while I had the chance.
346;00:36:23,674;00:36:26,640;It was a difficult choice, my lady.
347;00:36:31,012;00:36:34,396;We've all had to make
347;00:36:31,012;00:36:34,396;difficult choices.
348;00:36:53,947;00:36:56,163;We shouldn't be lighting fires.
349;00:36:56,248;00:36:57,331;It's not safe.
350;00:36:57,416;00:36:58,749;He won't stop hunting us.
351;00:36:58,867;00:37:00,533;We just have to make it
351;00:36:58,867;00:37:00,533;to Castle Black.
352;00:37:00,618;00:37:03,085;Once we're with Jon, Ramsay
352;00:37:00,618;00:37:03,085;won't be able to touch us.
353;00:37:03,204;00:37:06,037;Jon will have me killed the
353;00:37:03,204;00:37:06,037;moment I step through the gate.
354;00:37:06,123;00:37:07,789;I won't let him.
355;00:37:07,874;00:37:09,873;I'll tell him the truth
355;00:37:07,874;00:37:09,873;about Bran and Rickon.
356;00:37:11,677;00:37:14,877;And the truth about the farm
356;00:37:11,677;00:37:14,877;boys I killed in their place.
357;00:37:15,013;00:37:18,680;And the truth about
357;00:37:15,013;00:37:18,680;Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded.
358;00:37:20,768;00:37:23,684;And the truth about Robb,
358;00:37:20,768;00:37:23,684;who I betrayed.
359;00:37:25,305;00:37:28,138;When you take the black,
359;00:37:25,305;00:37:28,138;all your crimes are forgiven.
360;00:37:28,223;00:37:30,056;I don't want to be forgiven.
361;00:37:32,560;00:37:34,560;I can never make
361;00:37:32,560;00:37:34,560;amends to your family
362;00:37:34,695;00:37:36,144;for the things I've done.
363;00:37:38,114;00:37:40,530;They'll keep you safer
363;00:37:38,114;00:37:40,530;than I ever could.
364;00:37:45,236;00:37:47,870;You're not coming with us?
365;00:37:50,040;00:37:53,324;I would have taken you
365;00:37:50,040;00:37:53,324;all the way to the Wall.
366;00:37:54,660;00:37:56,410;I would have died to get you there.
367;00:38:13,258;00:38:15,641;May I take one of the horses?
368;00:38:19,095;00:38:21,396;Where will you go?
369;00:38:24,099;00:38:26,066;Home.
370;00:38:34,658;00:38:38,776;The Glovers have
370;00:38:34,658;00:38:38,776;retaken Deepwood Motte.
371;00:38:38,911;00:38:41,110;And the ironborn who held it?
372;00:38:41,246;00:38:44,447;They died fighting to a man.
373;00:38:46,033;00:38:48,250;What is dead may never die.
374;00:38:48,335;00:38:50,534;What is dead may never die.
375;00:38:50,620;00:38:52,620;But they did
376;00:38:52,755;00:38:55,422;and our invasion died with them.
377;00:38:55,507;00:38:58,624;Deepwood Motte was our last
377;00:38:55,507;00:38:58,624;stronghold on the mainland.
378;00:38:58,759;00:39:00,376;Then we will take more.
379;00:39:00,461;00:39:03,711;Why? For more pinecones and rocks?
380;00:39:05,882;00:39:08,298;Because I order it.
381;00:39:08,434;00:39:10,434;We can defeat anyone at sea,
382;00:39:10,519;00:39:12,718;but we'll never hold
382;00:39:10,519;00:39:12,718;lands and castles
383;00:39:12,804;00:39:14,303;against mainland armies.
384;00:39:14,389;00:39:16,638;Not if our captains defy my orders,
385;00:39:16,773;00:39:21,191;abandon their posts, and sacrifice
385;00:39:16,773;00:39:21,191;our men on foolish missions.
386;00:39:21,310;00:39:23,277;I won't apologize
386;00:39:21,310;00:39:23,277;for trying to rescue Theon.
387;00:39:23,362;00:39:24,478;Then where is he?
388;00:39:24,563;00:39:27,030;Where is your kingdom?
389;00:39:27,148;00:39:31,149;We took those castles because the
389;00:39:27,148;00:39:31,149;northerners marched off to war.
390;00:39:31,235;00:39:33,318;That war is over.
391;00:39:33,404;00:39:35,152;The last time
391;00:39:33,404;00:39:35,152;we provoked them too far,
392;00:39:35,288;00:39:37,954;I watched from that window
392;00:39:35,288;00:39:37,954;as they breached our walls
393;00:39:38,040;00:39:39,989;and knocked down our towers.
394;00:39:40,125;00:39:41,908;I lost two brothers that day.
395;00:39:41,993;00:39:44,626;And I lost three sons.
396;00:39:45,963;00:39:47,912;The War of the Five
396;00:39:45,963;00:39:47,912;Kings, they call it.
397;00:39:47,997;00:39:49,914;Well, the other four are dead.
398;00:39:49,999;00:39:53,250;When you rule the Iron Islands, you
398;00:39:49,999;00:39:53,250;can wage all the peace you want.
399;00:39:53,335;00:39:55,168;But for now, shut your mouth and obey
400;00:39:55,304;00:39:57,970;or I will make another heir who will.
401;00:40:36,752;00:40:38,585;Let me pass.
402;00:40:41,038;00:40:44,372;You fool, move aside for your king.
403;00:40:45,425;00:40:47,342;Haven't I always, brother?
404;00:40:57,184;00:41:01,552;I thought you'd be rotting
404;00:40:57,184;00:41:01,552;under some foreign sea by now.
405;00:41:01,637;00:41:05,022;What is dead may never die.
406;00:41:07,225;00:41:10,192;Has the custom changed
406;00:41:07,225;00:41:10,192;since I've been gone?
407;00:41:10,277;00:41:12,528;Aren't you supposed
407;00:41:10,277;00:41:12,528;to repeat the words?
408;00:41:12,613;00:41:15,696;You can mock our god without my help.
409;00:41:15,782;00:41:18,566;I don't mock the Drowned God.
410;00:41:18,651;00:41:21,535;I am the Drowned God.
411;00:41:21,620;00:41:23,486;From Oldtown to Qarth,
412;00:41:23,571;00:41:27,156;when men see my sails, they pray.
413;00:41:36,048;00:41:39,465;You're old, brother.
414;00:41:39,584;00:41:41,416;You've had your time.
415;00:41:41,502;00:41:43,802;Now let another rule.
416;00:41:43,921;00:41:47,087;I heard you lost your mind
417;00:41:47,173;00:41:50,256;during a storm on the Jade Sea.
418;00:41:50,342;00:41:55,727;They tied you to the mast to
418;00:41:50,342;00:41:55,727;keep you from jumping overboard.
419;00:41:55,813;00:41:57,346;They did.
420;00:41:57,431;00:42:02,016;And when the storm passed,
420;00:41:57,431;00:42:02,016;you cut out their tongues.
421;00:42:02,101;00:42:04,017;I needed silence.
422;00:42:05,320;00:42:07,570;What kind of an ironborn
423;00:42:07,655;00:42:11,573;loses his senses during a storm?
424;00:42:11,658;00:42:15,527;I am the storm, brother.
425;00:42:15,612;00:42:17,911;The first storm and the last.
426;00:42:19,415;00:42:21,447;And you're in my way.
427;00:42:59,479;00:43:03,947;Lord, take your servant Balon
427;00:42:59,479;00:43:03,947;back beneath the waves.
428;00:43:04,032;00:43:07,366;Feed the creatures of your
428;00:43:04,032;00:43:07,366;kingdom on his flesh.
429;00:43:07,485;00:43:09,484;Pull his bones down to your depths
430;00:43:09,620;00:43:12,370;to rest beside his ancestors
430;00:43:09,620;00:43:12,370;and his children.
431;00:43:12,489;00:43:14,788;What is dead may never die.
432;00:43:23,964;00:43:26,497;I'm going to find out who did this.
433;00:43:26,583;00:43:29,667;I'm going to feed them to
433;00:43:26,583;00:43:29,667;the sharks while they live.
434;00:43:31,336;00:43:34,137;I swear it by the Salt Throne.
435;00:43:34,223;00:43:37,056;The Salt Throne is not
435;00:43:34,223;00:43:37,056;yours to swear upon,
436;00:43:37,174;00:43:39,224;not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.
437;00:43:39,342;00:43:41,175;My father would have
437;00:43:39,342;00:43:41,175;wanted me to rule.
438;00:43:41,311;00:43:44,561;Your father does not get to choose.
438;00:43:41,311;00:43:44,561;The law is clear.
439;00:43:46,849;00:43:49,015;Perhaps you'll win.
440;00:43:49,100;00:43:52,317;Perhaps you'll be the first woman
440;00:43:49,100;00:43:52,317;in history to rule the ironborn.
441;00:43:53,604;00:43:55,353;And perhaps not.
442;00:44:12,201;00:44:13,951;Come in.
443;00:44:20,041;00:44:23,708;I'm sorry, my lady.
443;00:44:20,041;00:44:23,708;Didn't mean to interrupt.
444;00:44:23,843;00:44:25,927;You interrupt nothing.
445;00:44:37,638;00:44:40,771;I assume you know why I'm here.
446;00:44:42,058;00:44:43,557;I will after you tell me.
447;00:44:43,693;00:44:45,892;It's about the Lord Commander.
448;00:44:45,977;00:44:48,144;The former Lord Commander.
449;00:44:49,780;00:44:51,280;Does he have to be?
450;00:44:54,734;00:44:56,984;What are you asking?
451;00:45:00,906;00:45:04,707;Do you know of any magic...
452;00:45:06,410;00:45:08,042;that could help him?
453;00:45:08,128;00:45:09,494;Bring him back?
454;00:45:09,579;00:45:12,212;If you want to help him,
454;00:45:09,579;00:45:12,212;leave him be.
455;00:45:12,298;00:45:14,464;Can it be done?
456;00:45:14,583;00:45:17,133;There are some with this power.
457;00:45:17,251;00:45:19,802;- How?
457;00:45:17,251;00:45:19,802;I don't know.
458;00:45:19,921;00:45:20,969;Have you seen it done?
459;00:45:24,224;00:45:26,674;I met a man who came
459;00:45:24,224;00:45:26,674;back from the dead,
460;00:45:26,759;00:45:29,892;but the priest
460;00:45:26,759;00:45:29,892;who did it--
461;00:45:29,978;00:45:31,894;it shouldn't have been possible.
462;00:45:31,980;00:45:35,147;But it was.
462;00:45:31,980;00:45:35,147;It could be now.
463;00:45:35,265;00:45:37,565;Not for me.
464;00:45:41,738;00:45:43,770;Not for you?
465;00:45:47,441;00:45:51,109;I saw you drink poison that
465;00:45:47,441;00:45:51,109;should have killed you.
466;00:45:51,194;00:45:54,278;I saw you give birth
466;00:45:51,194;00:45:54,278;to a demon made of shadows.
467;00:45:54,414;00:45:56,997;Everything I believed,
468;00:45:57,116;00:46:00,533;the great victory
468;00:45:57,116;00:46:00,533;I saw in the flames,
469;00:46:00,618;00:46:02,201;all of it was a lie.
470;00:46:06,590;00:46:08,539;You were right all along.
471;00:46:08,624;00:46:11,375;The Lord never spoke to me.
472;00:46:11,460;00:46:13,426;Fuck him, then.
473;00:46:13,511;00:46:15,428;Fuck all of them.
474;00:46:17,181;00:46:20,849;I'm not a devout man, obviously.
475;00:46:20,968;00:46:24,301;Seven gods, drowned gods,
475;00:46:20,968;00:46:24,301;tree gods, it's all the same.
476;00:46:27,389;00:46:30,140;I'm not asking the Lord
476;00:46:27,389;00:46:30,140;of Light for help.
477;00:46:30,274;00:46:34,776;I'm asking the woman who
477;00:46:30,274;00:46:34,776;showed me that miracles exist.
478;00:46:36,730;00:46:38,945;I never had this gift.
479;00:46:39,031;00:46:40,981;Have you ever tried?
480;00:50:23,955;00:50:26,455;Please.
