7;00:02:33,111;00:02:35,580;she had red hair.
8;00:02:37,199;00:02:39,250;Oh?
9;00:02:39,284;00:02:41,702;– How big were her feet?

10;00:02:41,753;00:02:45,089;I want you to tell me what
10;00:02:41,753;00:02:45,089;it was like to have someone.
11;00:02:45,123;00:02:47,091;To be with someone.
12;00:02:47,125;00:02:49,485;To love someone and have
12;00:02:47,125;00:02:49,485;them love you back.

13;00:02:53,015;00:02:56,350;sooner than I’d planned.

14;00:02:56,385;00:03:00,021;I’ll ever get to knowing.
15;00:03:03,559;00:03:05,142;So you and Gilly never?
16;00:03:05,194;00:03:06,477;No.
17;00:03:06,528;00:03:08,813;She just had a baby.
18;00:03:11,533;00:03:12,984;And she never offered.
19;00:03:13,035;00:03:15,486;But if she had,
20;00:03:15,488;00:03:18,155;you would have?
21;00:03:18,207;00:03:20,992;You’d have broken your vows?
22;00:03:24,913;00:03:26,998;The interesting thing is,
23;00:03:27,000;00:03:30,084;our vows never
23;00:03:27,000;00:03:30,084;specifically forbid
24;00:03:30,135;00:03:32,136;intimate relations with women.
25;00:03:32,170;00:03:33,804;What?
26;00:03:33,839;00:03:37,258;«I shall take no wife,» yes, that’s in there.
26;00:03:33,839;00:03:37,258;There’s no denying that.
27;00:03:37,309;00:03:39,727;«I shall father no children.»
27;00:03:37,309;00:03:39,727;It’s very specific.
28;00:03:39,761;00:03:42,513;But what do our vows
28;00:03:39,761;00:03:42,513;have to say about other…
29;00:03:42,564;00:03:45,733;activities is open
29;00:03:42,564;00:03:45,733;to interpretation.
30;00:03:47,686;00:03:51,188;I don’t think Ser Alliser
30;00:03:47,686;00:03:51,188;cares much for interpretation.
31;00:03:55,527;00:03:58,696;Anyway, there’s nothing
31;00:03:55,527;00:03:58,696;for him to interpret.
32;00:03:58,698;00:04:00,698;We didn’t.
33;00:04:04,119;00:04:06,087;So what’s it like?
34;00:04:07,839;00:04:09,674;It’s…
35;00:04:10,959;00:04:14,712;there’s this person,
35;00:04:10,959;00:04:14,712;this whole other person.
36;00:04:14,714;00:04:18,132;And you’re wrapped up in them
36;00:04:14,714;00:04:18,132;and they’re wrapped up in you.

40;00:04:24,724;00:04:28,025;I’m not a bleeding poet.
41;00:04:28,060;00:04:29,944;No, you’re really not.
42;00:04:29,978;00:04:31,862;What did I get for it?
43;00:04:31,897;00:04:34,815;An arrow six inches
43;00:04:31,897;00:04:34,815;from my heart.
44;00:04:36,318;00:04:38,903;There’ll be arrows for all
44;00:04:36,318;00:04:38,903;of us soon, I imagine.
45;00:04:38,954;00:04:40,571;There will.
46;00:04:40,573;00:04:43,933;They’ve already done the worst
46;00:04:40,573;00:04:43,933;thing to me they could ever do.
47;00:04:46,745;00:04:48,746;Go get some sleep, Sam.
48;00:04:48,797;00:04:51,048;I’ll take this watch.

52;00:05:36,712;00:05:39,797;– My Sheila?
52;00:05:36,712;00:05:39,797;– Yes.
53;00:05:39,799;00:05:42,133;That was a night to remember.
54;00:05:42,184;00:05:45,636;Of course, I’d had
54;00:05:42,184;00:05:45,636;a good bit to drink.

56;00:05:47,389;00:05:48,856;Her fangs were sharp,
57;00:05:48,890;00:05:51,108;but she knew how to use them.
58;00:05:51,143;00:05:54,895;And she was nice
58;00:05:51,143;00:05:54,895;and soft down below.
59;00:05:54,946;00:05:57,531;No, she was no ordinary beast.
60;00:05:57,566;00:05:59,450;Many is the man who–
61;00:05:59,484;00:06:01,569;I know you never fucked a bear.
62;00:06:01,620;00:06:04,372;You know you never
62;00:06:01,620;00:06:04,372;fucked a bear.
63;00:06:04,406;00:06:07,658;Right now I don’t want to think
63;00:06:04,406;00:06:07,658;about the bear you never fucked.
64;00:06:07,709;00:06:10,828;Right now all I want
64;00:06:07,709;00:06:10,828;to think about
65;00:06:10,830;00:06:13,631;is each one of these arrows finding
65;00:06:10,830;00:06:13,631;its way into a crow’s heart.
66;00:06:15,167;00:06:17,218;We could be waiting
66;00:06:15,167;00:06:17,218;here a while.
67;00:06:17,252;00:06:18,586;Good.
68;00:06:18,637;00:06:20,918;The longer we wait,
68;00:06:18,637;00:06:20,918;the more arrows I’ll have.
69;00:06:25,010;00:06:28,229;They came up here to our land
70;00:06:28,263;00:06:30,815;and put up a big wall
70;00:06:28,263;00:06:30,815;and said it was theirs.
71;00:06:30,849;00:06:33,234;Then they started
71;00:06:30,849;00:06:33,234;hunting us down.
72;00:06:35,020;00:06:38,572;This time, we’re the ones
72;00:06:35,020;00:06:38,572;doing the hunting.
73;00:06:40,275;00:06:43,077;You’ve got a lot
73;00:06:40,275;00:06:43,077;to say about killing.
74;00:06:43,111;00:06:45,196;Even more words than arrows.
75;00:06:46,865;00:06:49,700;Back in those villages, I killed
75;00:06:46,865;00:06:49,700;just as many of them as you did.
76;00:06:49,751;00:06:51,752;More, I reckon.
77;00:06:51,787;00:06:55,873;Yes, but none of those
77;00:06:51,787;00:06:55,873;were your crow lover.
78;00:06:55,875;00:06:57,675;I probably killed him already.
79;00:06:57,709;00:06:59,126;Styr: – So you’ve said.
80;00:06:59,177;00:07:01,345;And if not,
81;00:07:01,379;00:07:05,049;the only thing left of him is gonna be
81;00:07:01,379;00:07:05,049;his fun bits hanging around my neck.
82;00:07:05,051;00:07:06,892;Styr: – More words.
83;00:07:06,935;00:07:09,270;Know what I think
83;00:07:06,935;00:07:09,270;you do when you see him?
84;00:07:09,304;00:07:13,140;Serve him up a nice juicy
84;00:07:09,304;00:07:13,140;slice of ginger minge.

87;00:07:25,836;00:07:28,421;Wondering what Maybe I have.
88;00:07:28,455;00:07:30,957;Jon Snow is mine.

90;00:07:34,928;00:07:37,680;I’ll have an arrow for them.
91;00:07:40,133;00:07:44,136;And not one of your bald friends
91;00:07:40,133;00:07:44,136;is fast enough to stop me.
92;00:08:05,242;00:08:10,129;And what is it that couldn’t
92;00:08:05,242;00:08:10,129;wait until morning, Tarly?
93;00:08:10,163;00:08:12,298;Maester Aemon.
94;00:08:12,332;00:08:14,834;– How did you know–
94;00:08:12,332;00:08:14,834;– That it was you?
95;00:08:14,885;00:08:17,470;Who else but Samwell Tarly
96;00:08:17,504;00:08:19,388;would be wasting candles
97;00:08:19,423;00:08:22,058;to read in the middle
97;00:08:19,423;00:08:22,058;of the night?
98;00:08:25,646;00:08:28,180;– Let me help you.
98;00:08:25,646;00:08:28,180;– Oh, no need.
99;00:08:29,483;00:08:31,567;I know my way
99;00:08:29,483;00:08:31,567;around this library
100;00:08:31,602;00:08:34,186;better than any other

101;00:08:34,188;00:08:36,522;Thousands of books
102;00:08:36,524;00:08:38,858;and no eyes to read them.
103;00:08:38,860;00:08:42,912;Old age is a wonderful
103;00:08:38,860;00:08:42,912;source of ironies
104;00:08:42,946;00:08:45,114;if nothing else.
105;00:08:45,165;00:08:47,667;But you didn’t
105;00:08:45,165;00:08:47,667;answer my question.
106;00:08:47,701;00:08:49,285;What are you reading?
107;00:08:49,336;00:08:51,704;Maester Faull.
108;00:08:51,706;00:08:54,707;Ah, the wildlings.
109;00:08:54,709;00:08:58,294;I can assure you that
109;00:08:54,709;00:08:58,294;the closest Maester Faull

110;00:08:58,345;00:09:01,714;was this very library.
111;00:09:01,716;00:09:04,684;But what he says
111;00:09:01,716;00:09:04,684;about what they do,
112;00:09:04,718;00:09:06,185;it’s all true.
113;00:09:06,219;00:09:09,889;It’s exactly what the survivors
113;00:09:06,219;00:09:09,889;of their raids report.
114;00:09:09,940;00:09:14,777;Yes, imagine the stories
114;00:09:09,940;00:09:14,777;wildlings tell about us.
115;00:09:16,313;00:09:19,231;Love is the death of duty.
116;00:09:20,484;00:09:22,985;I told that to your friend
116;00:09:20,484;00:09:22,985;Jon Snow once.
117;00:09:23,036;00:09:27,239;He didn’t listen
117;00:09:23,036;00:09:27,239;and neither did you.
118;00:09:27,290;00:09:31,243;Which is why you’ve abandoned
118;00:09:27,290;00:09:31,243;your watch atop the Wall
119;00:09:31,294;00:09:35,247;to come here and read
119;00:09:31,294;00:09:35,247;about the terrible things
120;00:09:35,249;00:09:39,418;that may have happened
120;00:09:35,249;00:09:39,418;to the girl you love.
121;00:09:39,420;00:09:42,421;I don’t love her.
122;00:09:42,472;00:09:44,423;– Yes, you do.
122;00:09:42,472;00:09:44,423;– No.
123;00:09:44,425;00:09:46,142;Yes, you do.
124;00:09:46,176;00:09:50,346;Heard it in your voice when
124;00:09:46,176;00:09:50,346;you first brought her to me.
125;00:09:50,397;00:09:52,598;I remember how it sounds.
126;00:09:52,649;00:09:54,600;I was in love once.
127;00:09:54,651;00:09:55,935;You were?
128;00:09:55,937;00:10:00,272;You can imagine
128;00:09:55,937;00:10:00,272;all manner of horrors
129;00:10:00,274;00:10:02,942;befalling that poor
129;00:10:00,274;00:10:02,942;girl and her child.
130;00:10:02,993;00:10:05,745;Is it so difficult to imagine
131;00:10:05,779;00:10:07,663;that an old person was once,
132;00:10:07,698;00:10:09,865;more or less, like you?
133;00:10:09,916;00:10:12,535;I’m sorry, Maester.
134;00:10:12,586;00:10:14,286;I didn’t mean it like that.
135;00:10:14,337;00:10:18,224;Do you know who I was
135;00:10:14,337;00:10:18,224;before I came here?
136;00:10:18,258;00:10:22,294;What I could have been
136;00:10:18,258;00:10:22,294;if I’d only said the word?
137;00:10:23,797;00:10:25,631;Of course you do.
138;00:10:25,665;00:10:29,385;I met many girls
138;00:10:25,665;00:10:29,385;when I was Aemon Targaryen.
139;00:10:29,436;00:10:33,305;A future king always does.
140;00:10:34,307;00:10:36,942;Some of them were quite forward
141;00:10:36,977;00:10:39,645;in their attempts
141;00:10:36,977;00:10:39,645;to win my affections.
142;00:10:40,814;00:10:43,115;One of them succeeded.
143;00:10:44,117;00:10:46,035;I was very young.
144;00:10:46,069;00:10:48,687;Who was she?
145;00:10:48,722;00:10:50,656;Ah.
146;00:10:50,658;00:10:53,242;I could tell you
146;00:10:50,658;00:10:53,242;everything about her.
147;00:10:53,293;00:10:55,161;Who she was,
148;00:10:55,195;00:10:56,962;how we met,
149;00:10:56,997;00:10:59,131;the color of her eyes,
150;00:10:59,166;00:11:01,901;and the shape of her nose.
151;00:11:03,804;00:11:05,971;I can see her
152;00:11:06,006;00:11:08,841;right in front of me.
153;00:11:10,694;00:11:14,263;She’s more real than you are.
154;00:11:17,350;00:11:21,687;We could spend all night
154;00:11:17,350;00:11:21,687;trading tales of lost loves.
155;00:11:21,738;00:11:24,523;Nothing makes the past
155;00:11:21,738;00:11:24,523;a sweeter place to visit
156;00:11:24,574;00:11:27,726;than the prospect
156;00:11:24,574;00:11:27,726;of imminent death.
157;00:11:27,761;00:11:30,079;Go to bed, Tarly.
158;00:11:36,086;00:11:38,671;Pyp: –  Sorry, I can’t open the
158;00:11:36,086;00:11:38,671;gate for anybody. Orders.
159;00:11:38,705;00:11:40,956;Gilly: –  You don’t understand.
159;00:11:38,705;00:11:40,956;They killed everyone.
160;00:11:41,007;00:11:43,042;Everyone but me and my baby.
161;00:11:43,093;00:11:45,461;They’re out there.
161;00:11:43,093;00:11:45,461;I saw them on my way here.
162;00:11:45,512;00:11:47,753;They may have seen me. They
162;00:11:45,512;00:11:47,753;may have followed me. Please.
163;00:11:47,764;00:11:49,181;Pyp: – I’m sorry, I can’t.
164;00:11:49,216;00:11:50,549;Gilly: –  If they find us out
164;00:11:49,216;00:11:50,549;here, you don’t know…
165;00:11:50,600;00:11:52,384;Pyp!
165;00:11:50,600;00:11:52,384;Open the gate.
166;00:11:52,435;00:11:55,137;– I can’t.
166;00:11:52,435;00:11:55,137;– Sam, is that you?
167;00:11:55,188;00:11:57,306;Yes.
168;00:11:57,357;00:11:59,391;Thorne gave me strict
168;00:11:57,357;00:11:59,391;orders to not open the gate.
169;00:11:59,393;00:12:02,027;Oh, Pyp, open the fucking gate!
170;00:12:03,480;00:12:05,064;I never heard you curse before.
171;00:12:05,115;00:12:07,199;Yes, well, best get used to it.
172;00:12:13,240;00:12:15,124;Are you all right?
173;00:12:15,158;00:12:17,076;– ( panting )
173;00:12:15,158;00:12:17,076;– ( baby fusses )
174;00:12:17,078;00:12:19,662;Shh, you’re all right.
175;00:12:19,713;00:12:23,582;Of course you are,
175;00:12:19,713;00:12:23,582;my brave little fella.
176;00:12:23,633;00:12:26,302;– It was horrible.
176;00:12:23,633;00:12:26,302;– I’m so, so sorry.
177;00:12:26,336;00:12:28,137;I didn’t know until I got back.
178;00:12:28,171;00:12:29,638;Don’t let them
178;00:12:28,171;00:12:29,638;send me away, Sam.
179;00:12:29,673;00:12:31,557;– Never.
179;00:12:29,673;00:12:31,557;– I know there’s no women allowed.
180;00:12:31,591;00:12:35,060;Anyone who tries to throw you out
180;00:12:31,591;00:12:35,060;will be having words with me.
181;00:12:35,095;00:12:38,097;From now on, wherever you go,
182;00:12:38,099;00:12:40,599;I go, too.
183;00:12:43,937;00:12:47,156;( horn blows )
184;00:12:48,241;00:12:50,659;( horn blows )
185;00:12:50,694;00:12:52,528;Man: – Get ready!
186;00:12:52,579;00:12:54,747;–  Man the gate!
186;00:12:52,579;00:12:54,747;–  Ready yourselves!
187;00:12:54,781;00:12:56,832;Make haste!
188;00:12:56,867;00:12:58,951;–  Prepare!
188;00:12:56,867;00:12:58,951;–  Up on the Wall!
189;00:12:59,002;00:13:00,563;Quickly!
189;00:12:59,002;00:13:00,563;Up! Up!
190;00:13:00,587;00:13:03,789;How many?
190;00:13:00,587;00:13:03,789;How many are there?
191;00:13:04,925;00:13:06,091;–  ( horn blows )
191;00:13:04,925;00:13:06,091;– ( screeches )
192;00:13:06,126;00:13:07,960;Beyond the trees!
193;00:13:11,798;00:13:13,933;It’s time.
194;00:13:29,149;00:13:31,650;( men shouting )
195;00:13:33,286;00:13:35,537;( horn blows )
196;00:14:01,181;00:14:03,599;Light them up!
196;00:14:01,181;00:14:03,599;Light them all!
197;00:14:03,650;00:14:06,735;–  ( horn blowing )
197;00:14:03,650;00:14:06,735;– ( men shouting )
198;00:14:13,243;00:14:15,027;Move!
199;00:14:17,697;00:14:19,031;Pick up the pace!
200;00:14:19,033;00:14:21,083;Come on, come on.
201;00:14:27,757;00:14:30,342;Here we go, boys, there’s one.
202;00:14:30,377;00:14:33,545;Let’s go.
202;00:14:30,377;00:14:33,545;There’s two.
203;00:14:36,633;00:14:38,634;Let’s get the next load.
204;00:14:41,554;00:14:44,056;That’s the last
204;00:14:41,554;00:14:44,056;of the oil, Ser Alliser.
205;00:14:45,392;00:14:48,193;100,000 you say?
206;00:14:48,228;00:14:50,396;Yes, Ser.
207;00:14:50,398;00:14:52,731;You can say it if you like.
208;00:14:52,733;00:14:56,618;We should have sealed the
208;00:14:52,733;00:14:56,618;tunnel while we had the chance,
209;00:14:56,653;00:15:00,039;like you suggested.
210;00:15:00,073;00:15:03,292;It was a difficult
210;00:15:00,073;00:15:03,292;decision either way, Ser.
211;00:15:05,462;00:15:09,081;Do you know what leadership
211;00:15:05,462;00:15:09,081;means, Lord Snow?
212;00:15:09,132;00:15:12,217;It means that the person in
212;00:15:09,132;00:15:12,217;charge gets second-guessed
213;00:15:12,252;00:15:14,837;by every clever little
213;00:15:12,252;00:15:14,837;twat with a mouth.
214;00:15:14,888;00:15:17,256;But if he starts
214;00:15:14,888;00:15:17,256;second-guessing himself,
215;00:15:17,307;00:15:19,091;that’s the end–
216;00:15:19,142;00:15:22,594;for him, for the
216;00:15:19,142;00:15:22,594;clever little twats,
217;00:15:22,596;00:15:24,313;for everyone.
218;00:15:24,347;00:15:27,316;This is not the end.
218;00:15:24,347;00:15:27,316;Not for us.
219;00:15:27,350;00:15:29,485;Not if you lot do your duty
220;00:15:29,519;00:15:32,071;for however long it takes
220;00:15:29,519;00:15:32,071;to beat them back.
221;00:15:33,523;00:15:36,775;And then you get
221;00:15:33,523;00:15:36,775;to go on hating me
222;00:15:36,777;00:15:38,444;and I get to go on wishing
223;00:15:38,446;00:15:40,946;your wildling whore
223;00:15:38,446;00:15:40,946;had finished the job.
224;00:15:40,948;00:15:43,615;( horn blows )
225;00:16:04,137;00:16:05,771;Sam: – You’ll be safe down here.
226;00:16:05,805;00:16:07,689;I’ll check on you
226;00:16:05,805;00:16:07,689;as soon as I can.
227;00:16:07,724;00:16:10,642;You’re leaving me again?
228;00:16:11,728;00:16:13,362;I’m not leaving you.
229;00:16:13,396;00:16:16,148;You’re going up there and we’re
229;00:16:13,396;00:16:16,148;staying down here. That’s leaving.
230;00:16:16,199;00:16:18,567;You said from now on
230;00:16:16,199;00:16:18,567;we’d stay together.
231;00:16:18,618;00:16:21,620;I didn’t mean in the same room.
232;00:16:21,654;00:16:22,988;What are you going
232;00:16:21,654;00:16:22,988;to do out there?
233;00:16:22,990;00:16:24,470;– Help my brothers.
233;00:16:22,990;00:16:24,470;– How?
234;00:16:25,825;00:16:28,043;You’re going to fight the
234;00:16:25,825;00:16:28,043;free folk when they come?
235;00:16:28,078;00:16:30,913;They’ll kill you. In Mole’s
235;00:16:28,078;00:16:30,913;Town, they killed everyone.
236;00:16:30,964;00:16:34,550;I can’t just hide here with you
236;00:16:30,964;00:16:34,550;while they’re fighting out there.
237;00:16:34,584;00:16:37,419;Why not? You won’t
237;00:16:34,584;00:16:37,419;matter up there.
238;00:16:37,470;00:16:39,088;You will down here.
239;00:16:40,340;00:16:43,342;I am a man of
239;00:16:40,340;00:16:43,342;the Night’s Watch, Gilly.
240;00:16:43,393;00:16:45,677;I made a promise
240;00:16:43,393;00:16:45,677;to defend the Wall
241;00:16:45,679;00:16:47,513;and I have to keep it
242;00:16:47,564;00:16:50,149;because that’s what men do.
243;00:17:02,328;00:17:05,030;Promise me you won’t die.
244;00:17:07,667;00:17:11,203;I promise you I won’t die.
245;00:17:18,511;00:17:20,712;( lock clicks )
246;00:17:22,215;00:17:24,883;– ( men shouting )
246;00:17:22,215;00:17:24,883;– ( horse whinnies )
247;00:17:45,121;00:17:48,407;There’s a lot more wildlings on the
247;00:17:45,121;00:17:48,407;other side of the Wall than this side.
248;00:17:48,458;00:17:51,577;We’ve got loads
248;00:17:48,458;00:17:51,577;of weapons and things.
249;00:17:51,579;00:17:53,495;It’s the perfect place
249;00:17:51,579;00:17:53,495;for us to be.
250;00:17:53,546;00:17:55,747;I’ve never thrown
250;00:17:53,546;00:17:55,747;a spear before.
251;00:17:55,749;00:17:58,634;I’ve never held a sword
251;00:17:55,749;00:17:58,634;with a proper edge.
252;00:17:58,668;00:18:01,336;This is no place for me to be.
253;00:18:03,256;00:18:04,723;You’re not afraid?
254;00:18:04,757;00:18:07,226;Of course I’m afraid.
255;00:18:07,260;00:18:09,761;There’s a band of wildlings
255;00:18:07,260;00:18:09,761;coming to kill us.
256;00:18:09,763;00:18:11,230;If you’re afraid
256;00:18:09,763;00:18:11,230;of a band of wildlings,
257;00:18:11,264;00:18:14,516;how in seven hells did you
257;00:18:11,264;00:18:14,516;manage to kill a white walker?
258;00:18:19,989;00:18:22,658;I didn’t know
258;00:18:19,989;00:18:22,658;I was going to kill it.
259;00:18:22,692;00:18:25,444;But I had to do something.
259;00:18:22,692;00:18:25,444;I didn’t have any choice.
260;00:18:25,446;00:18:27,446;It was going to kill Gilly
260;00:18:25,446;00:18:27,446;and take the baby.
261;00:18:29,449;00:18:32,751;If someone had asked
261;00:18:29,449;00:18:32,751;me my name right then,
262;00:18:32,785;00:18:34,453;I wouldn’t have known.
263;00:18:36,206;00:18:39,174;I wasn’t Samwell Tarly anymore.
264;00:18:39,209;00:18:41,960;I wasn’t a steward

265;00:18:41,962;00:18:44,713;or son of Randyll Tarly
265;00:18:41,962;00:18:44,713;or any of that.
266;00:18:45,965;00:18:48,050;I was nothing at all.
267;00:18:49,936;00:18:51,887;And when you’re nothing at all,
268;00:18:51,938;00:18:54,556;there’s no more reason
268;00:18:51,938;00:18:54,556;to be afraid.
269;00:18:56,359;00:18:58,360;But you’re afraid now?
270;00:18:59,229;00:19:00,862;Yes, well…
271;00:19:02,732;00:19:04,816;I’m not nothing anymore.
272;00:19:24,087;00:19:25,504;Most of their men are up top.
273;00:19:25,506;00:19:28,840;Didn’t count more than 20 down here.
273;00:19:25,506;00:19:28,840;Leftovers.
274;00:19:28,891;00:19:30,976;They got a big fat one and a
274;00:19:28,891;00:19:30,976;little bony one manning the front.
275;00:19:31,010;00:19:32,511;How high are the walls?

433;00:36:48,407;00:36:50,858;If they try the mammoths
433;00:36:48,407;00:36:50,858;again, drop fire on them.
434;00:36:50,909;00:36:53,694;If the climbers get too high,
434;00:36:50,909;00:36:53,694;drop the scythe on them.
435;00:36:59,201;00:37:02,370;Come, brothers.
435;00:36:59,201;00:37:02,370;Now fight with me!
436;00:37:02,421;00:37:06,257;Might as well enjoy
436;00:37:02,421;00:37:06,257;our last night, right, boys?
437;00:37:06,341;00:37:08,259;Light the fuckers up!
438;00:37:08,293;00:37:11,462;Nock! Draw!
439;00:37:12,381;00:37:14,632;Loose!
440;00:37:23,225;00:37:24,392;How are we gonna stop that?
441;00:37:24,394;00:37:25,726;Shot 20 arrows in him already.
442;00:37:25,728;00:37:27,195;You heard Jon.
442;00:37:25,728;00:37:27,195;We hold the gate.
443;00:37:27,229;00:37:28,646;Jon Snow’s not Lord Commander.
444;00:37:28,697;00:37:30,364;We hold the gate!
445;00:37:39,241;00:37:41,742;Mother, save me.
445;00:37:39,241;00:37:41,742;Father, save me.
446;00:37:41,744;00:37:42,960;The gods aren’t down here.
447;00:37:42,995;00:37:44,836;It’s the six of us.
447;00:37:42,995;00:37:44,836;You hear me?
448;00:37:50,586;00:37:53,254;Night gathers
448;00:37:50,586;00:37:53,254;and now my watch begins.
449;00:37:53,305;00:37:55,723;It shall not end until my death.
450;00:37:55,757;00:37:58,226;I shall take no wife,
450;00:37:55,757;00:37:58,226;hold no lands,

452;00:37:59,895;00:38:02,430;I shall wear no crown
452;00:37:59,895;00:38:02,430;and win no glory.
453;00:38:02,432;00:38:04,649;I shall live and die at my post.
454;00:38:04,683;00:38:06,567;All: – I am the sword
454;00:38:04,683;00:38:06,567;in the darkness.
455;00:38:06,602;00:38:08,403;I am the watcher on the walls.
456;00:38:08,437;00:38:11,439;I am the shield that guards
456;00:38:08,437;00:38:11,439;the realms of men.
457;00:38:11,441;00:38:15,493;I pledge my life and honor
457;00:38:11,441;00:38:15,493;to the Night’s Watch
458;00:38:15,527;00:38:18,196;for this night
458;00:38:15,527;00:38:18,196;and all the nights to come!
459;00:38:18,247;00:38:20,281;– ( shouting )
459;00:38:18,247;00:38:20,281;– ( roaring )
460;00:38:23,952;00:38:25,419;I don’t want you out there.
461;00:38:25,454;00:38:27,672;You can’t protect me forever.
462;00:38:27,706;00:38:30,291;There won’t be anywhere
462;00:38:27,706;00:38:30,291;to hide if the castle falls.
463;00:38:33,128;00:38:35,680;I need him more than I need you.
464;00:39:49,171;00:39:51,706;We need you, boy.
465;00:39:51,757;00:39:53,874;( panting )
466;00:40:13,812;00:40:15,529;Ha!

473;00:42:12,180;00:42:15,433;Hush.
473;00:42:12,180;00:42:15,433;Don’t talk.
474;00:42:19,521;00:42:22,022;Do you remember the cave?
475;00:42:26,445;00:42:29,246;We should have
475;00:42:26,445;00:42:29,246;stayed in the cave.
476;00:42:33,201;00:42:35,202;We’ll go back there.
477;00:42:41,293;00:42:44,628;You know nothing, Jon Snow.
478;00:43:19,881;00:43:22,299;Drop the scythe, boys!
479;00:43:35,931;00:43:38,148;( screams )
480;00:43:44,439;00:43:46,941;– Hoist her up.
480;00:43:44,439;00:43:46,941;– Man: Hoist her up!
481;00:43:46,992;00:43:49,944;–  ( chain clanking )
481;00:43:46,992;00:43:49,944;–  ( men grunting )
482;00:43:52,864;00:43:54,949;They’ve had enough
482;00:43:52,864;00:43:54,949;for one night.

484;00:43:59,120;00:44:01,455;Don’t cheer too loud.
485;00:44:02,841;00:44:05,876;They still outnumber us
485;00:44:02,841;00:44:05,876;1,000 to one.

489;00:44:15,971;00:44:18,522;It’s over.
490;00:44:18,557;00:44:19,890;Let it end.
491;00:44:19,941;00:44:22,226;This is how a man ends.
492;00:44:30,201;00:44:31,735;Put him in chains.
493;00:44:32,821;00:44:34,655;We’ll question him later.
494;00:44:37,375;00:44:39,793;I should have thrown you
495;00:44:39,828;00:44:42,830;from the top of the Wall, boy!
496;00:44:42,832;00:44:44,882;Aye.
497;00:44:44,916;00:44:46,967;You should have.

500;00:44:54,092;00:44:56,760;It’s me.
501;00:45:00,599;00:45:02,433;I promised you, didn’t I?
502;00:45:05,604;00:45:07,821;( scuffles )
503;00:45:17,415;00:45:19,116;Sam: – We held them off.
504;00:45:19,167;00:45:21,118;Jon: – For one night.
505;00:45:21,169;00:45:23,504;This is a great victory.
506;00:45:23,538;00:45:25,706;A great victory?
507;00:45:27,258;00:45:29,510;Mance was testing our defenses.
508;00:45:29,544;00:45:31,128;He almost made it through.
509;00:45:31,179;00:45:33,964;And he has more giants.
509;00:45:31,179;00:45:33,964;He has more mammoths.
510;00:45:34,015;00:45:36,717;He has 1,000 times as many men.
511;00:45:40,055;00:45:42,640;They’ll hit us again tonight.
512;00:45:42,691;00:45:45,109;Maybe we can hold them
512;00:45:42,691;00:45:45,109;off for a day or two,
513;00:45:45,143;00:45:47,183;but we’ll never beat them.
514;00:45:48,113;00:45:49,480;Where are we going?
515;00:45:49,531;00:45:51,198;Going to find Mance.
516;00:45:51,232;00:45:53,934;To fi–-
516;00:45:51,232;00:45:53,934;you can’t do that.
517;00:45:53,969;00:45:55,819;No one gave you any orders.
518;00:45:57,572;00:45:59,957;Who’s left to give orders?
519;00:45:59,991;00:46:02,743;The wildling army’s only
519;00:45:59,991;00:46:02,743;an army because of Mance.
520;00:46:02,745;00:46:05,496;He united 100 warring tribes.
521;00:46:05,547;00:46:07,581;Without Mance,
521;00:46:05,547;00:46:07,581;they lose their leader.
522;00:46:07,583;00:46:10,300;They lose their purpose. They
522;00:46:07,583;00:46:10,300;go back to fighting each other.
523;00:46:10,335;00:46:12,136;Scatter back to their homes.
524;00:46:12,170;00:46:14,338;Without Mance?
525;00:46:14,389;00:46:15,806;You’re going to kill him?
526;00:46:15,840;00:46:17,141;I’m gonna try.
527;00:46:17,175;00:46:19,009;They’ll never let you
527;00:46:17,175;00:46:19,009;within 100 yards of him.
528;00:46:19,060;00:46:21,261;And even if they did, even
528;00:46:19,060;00:46:21,261;if you managed to kill him–
529;00:46:21,263;00:46:23,847;They’ll kill me? If I don’t
529;00:46:21,263;00:46:23,847;go, they’ll kill me anyway.
530;00:46:23,898;00:46:25,315;They’ll kill
530;00:46:23,898;00:46:25,315;the rest of us, too.
531;00:46:25,350;00:46:27,901;Sam: – They won’t just kill you.
532;00:46:27,936;00:46:29,770;They’ll boil you.
532;00:46:27,936;00:46:29,770;They’ll flay you.
533;00:46:29,821;00:46:31,321;They’ll make it last days.
534;00:46:34,109;00:46:37,661;You’re right.
534;00:46:34,109;00:46:37,661;It’s a bad plan.
535;00:46:39,664;00:46:41,699;What’s your plan?
536;00:47:24,993;00:47:27,161;They held the gate.
537;00:47:36,387;00:47:38,972;Get some brothers
537;00:47:36,387;00:47:38,972;down here to help you.
538;00:47:41,092;00:47:43,393;We need to burn the bodies.
539;00:48:04,199;00:48:07,201;Raise the outer gate.
540;00:48:07,252;00:48:09,787;Then lower it again
540;00:48:07,252;00:48:09,787;as soon as I’m out.
541;00:48:21,216;00:48:22,716;What are you doing?
542;00:48:22,718;00:48:25,435;I promised Mormont
542;00:48:22,718;00:48:25,435;I’d never lose it again.
