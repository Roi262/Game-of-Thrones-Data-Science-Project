1
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:29,555
Weak men will never rule Dorne again.

2
00:00:31,993 --> 00:00:33,158
Riverrun is ours.

3
00:00:33,261 --> 00:00:35,194
You let the Blackfish
take it from you.

4
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:37,296
Take that castle back.

5
00:00:37,398 --> 00:00:39,064
He'll never yield, father.

6
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,567
<i>You'll remind him
who it was that got married</i>

7
00:00:41,669 --> 00:00:44,303
<i>at the Red Wedding
in the first place.</i>

8
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,072
Command all the forces
within the castle

9
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:49,308
to lay down their arms.
Open the gates.

10
00:00:54,282 --> 00:00:56,382
Your aunt Lyanna...

11
00:00:56,484 --> 00:00:58,717
<i>She was already promised
to Robert Baratheon.</i>

12
00:00:58,819 --> 00:01:00,653
<i>Father never talked about her.</i>

13
00:01:01,455 --> 00:01:03,355
How many tens of thousands had to die

14
00:01:03,457 --> 00:01:05,124
because Rhaegar chose your aunt.

15
00:01:05,226 --> 00:01:07,066
<i>And then he kidnapped
her and raped her.</i>

16
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:14,133
We need friends in Westeros,
and we need ships.

17
00:01:14,235 --> 00:01:17,169
I hope you're right about
this expedition of yours.

18
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:20,105
If I don't return,
you'll know I was wrong.

19
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:23,309
Our fathers were evil men.

20
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:25,778
They left the world
worse than they found it.

21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,514
We're going to leave the world
better than we found it.

22
00:01:31,052 --> 00:01:33,719
Your reign is over.

23
00:01:34,488 --> 00:01:35,621
My reign has just begun.

24
00:01:43,164 --> 00:01:45,297
You've made great progress.

25
00:01:45,633 --> 00:01:48,500
I only pray your grandmother
follows your lead,

26
00:01:48,602 --> 00:01:50,336
or I fear for her safety.

27
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:54,807
Go home. Find comfort
in prayer and good works.

28
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:56,642
The Mother watches over us all.

29
00:01:56,744 --> 00:01:59,178
<i>After conferring with
His Holiness, the High Septon,</i>

30
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,747
we have determined that
trial by combat

31
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:04,483
will be forbidden throughout
the Seven Kingdoms.

32
00:02:04,585 --> 00:02:06,819
Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell

33
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:08,887
will stand trial before seven septons

34
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,056
as it was in the earliest days
of the faith.

35
00:03:55,644 --> 00:04:06,295

36
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,656
<i>Your Grace.</i>

37
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:41,393
The trial will be
getting under way soon.

38
00:07:13,827 --> 00:07:15,227
You got my money?

39
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:17,629
Later.
Go away.

40
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:30,742
Grand Maester.

41
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:13,618
Ser Loras Tyrell.

42
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:18,190
Are you prepared to stand trial

43
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:21,993
and profess your guilt or
innocence before the Seven?

44
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:26,998
There'll be no need for a trial.

45
00:08:29,503 --> 00:08:31,903
I confess before the Seven

46
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:34,005
and freely admit to my crimes.

47
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:38,243
To which crimes
will you be confessing?

48
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:40,679
All of them.

49
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,116
I lay with other men

50
00:08:44,218 --> 00:08:47,652
including the traitor
Renly Baratheon.

51
00:08:51,158 --> 00:08:53,925
<i>I perjured myself before the gods.</i>

52
00:08:54,027 --> 00:08:56,328
I am guilty of depravity...

53
00:08:57,831 --> 00:08:59,831
dishonesty,

54
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:01,400
profligacy,

55
00:09:01,502 --> 00:09:04,369
<i>and arrogance.</i>

56
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:05,904
I see that now.

57
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:10,509
I humble myself before the Seven

58
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:14,012
and accept whatever punishment
the gods deem just.

59
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:20,919
The gods' judgment is fierce,

60
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:23,555
but also fair.

61
00:09:23,657 --> 00:09:27,025
The Warrior punishes those
who believe themselves

62
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:29,394
beyond the reach of justice.

63
00:09:30,898 --> 00:09:33,965
But the Mother shows her mercy

64
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:37,869
to those who kneel before her.

65
00:09:45,913 --> 00:09:48,613
<i>I take full
responsibility for my many sins</i>

66
00:09:48,715 --> 00:09:51,216
and unburden myself of my desires.

67
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:57,622
My only remaining wish

68
00:09:57,724 --> 00:10:00,325
is to devote my life to the Seven.

69
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:03,495
<i>May I be a living example
of their grace</i>

70
00:10:03,597 --> 00:10:06,264
<i>for others to witness.</i>

71
00:10:07,835 --> 00:10:11,303
You understand fully

72
00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:13,238
what this means?

73
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,840
I do.

74
00:10:17,411 --> 00:10:19,544
I will abandon the Tyrell name

75
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:22,681
and all that goes with it.

76
00:10:22,783 --> 00:10:26,551
I will renounce my lordship
and my claims on Highgarden.

77
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,424
I will never marry

78
00:10:32,526 --> 00:10:34,926
and I will never father children.

79
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:40,465
<i>Brother Loras...</i>

80
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:45,337
...I ask you to dedicate
your life to the seven gods.

81
00:10:49,576 --> 00:10:52,377
Will you fight to defend your faith

82
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:54,913
against heretics and apostates?

83
00:10:55,015 --> 00:10:56,515
I will.

84
00:11:25,712 --> 00:11:26,878
No, I can't let them--

85
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,948
Faith is the way, Father.

86
00:11:52,506 --> 00:11:53,672
All right.

87
00:11:54,908 --> 00:11:56,608
I'm ready.

88
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:06,551
I have to go.
I'm--

89
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,587
I'm late for the trial.

90
00:12:21,735 --> 00:12:23,835
<i>You mutilated him.</i>

91
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:25,837
You gave me your word.

92
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:28,306
And I have kept my word.

93
00:12:28,408 --> 00:12:31,176
<i>Once the queen mother's
trial is concluded,</i>

94
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:33,311
<i>Brother Loras is free to leave.</i>

95
00:12:33,413 --> 00:12:35,313
And where is the queen mother?

96
00:12:35,415 --> 00:12:38,683
Her litter never left the Red Keep.

97
00:12:38,785 --> 00:12:42,721
It appears the queen mother doesn't
wish to attend her own trial.

98
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,792
Go to the Red Keep
and show her the way.

99
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:16,421
Get the others.

100
00:13:58,465 --> 00:14:00,398
Where's the king?

101
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,303
Elsewhere, I'm afraid.

102
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:07,038
What's the meaning of this?

103
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,007
I was told that--

104
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:10,575
ah.

105
00:14:10,677 --> 00:14:12,777
I have more important
things to do with my time

106
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,245
than waste them
in the presence--

107
00:14:14,347 --> 00:14:17,015
Please, Grand Maester.
I bear you no ill will.

108
00:14:18,485 --> 00:14:20,819
Please forgive me if you can.

109
00:14:52,586 --> 00:14:54,719
This pains me, my lord.

110
00:14:54,821 --> 00:14:56,888
Whatever your faults,
you do not deserve

111
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,958
to die alone in such
a cold, dark place.

112
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,795
But sometimes before
we can usher in the new,

113
00:15:03,897 --> 00:15:08,032
the old must be put to rest.

114
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:52,310
The longer you wait,
the worse it'll be for you.

115
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:21,306
What are you doing?

116
00:17:28,675 --> 00:17:30,742
There's something wrong.

117
00:17:30,844 --> 00:17:33,311
You have nothing to fear, Your Grace.

118
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:35,280
The trial will begin shortly.

119
00:17:35,382 --> 00:17:38,082
Cersei is not here.
Tommen is not here.

120
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:39,544
Why do you think they're not here?

121
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:41,452
If the accused is not here,

122
00:17:41,554 --> 00:17:43,621
she will be tried regardless.

123
00:17:43,723 --> 00:17:45,957
We cannot escape
the justice of the gods--

124
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:48,693
Forget about the bloody gods and
listen to what I'm telling you.

125
00:17:48,795 --> 00:17:52,230
Cersei understands the
consequences of her absence

126
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:54,098
and she is absent anyway,

127
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,069
which means she does not intend
to suffer those consequences.

128
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:02,040
The trial can wait.
We all need to leave.

129
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:29,934
We all need to leave now.

130
00:18:34,574 --> 00:18:37,342
Loras.

131
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:39,610
Stay with me.

132
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:54,859
Let me through.
Let me through.

133
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,030
<i>Get out of my way.</i>

134
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,273
Let us through.

135
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:40,765
<i>Confess.</i>

136
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:44,902
<i>Confess.</i>

137
00:20:49,242 --> 00:20:51,242
- No.
- Confess.

138
00:21:00,854 --> 00:21:03,688
Confess.
It felt good.

139
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:07,492
Beating me, starving me,

140
00:21:07,594 --> 00:21:10,495
frightening me, humiliating me.

141
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,267
<i>You didn't do it because
you cared about my atonement.</i>

142
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:19,504
You did it because it felt good.

143
00:21:19,606 --> 00:21:21,839
<i>I understand.</i>

144
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:25,109
I do things because they feel good.

145
00:21:28,081 --> 00:21:31,415
I drink because it feels good.

146
00:21:31,518 --> 00:21:35,620
I killed my husband because it
felt good to be rid of him.

147
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:43,928
I fuck my brother because it feels
good to feel him inside me.

148
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,097
I lie about fucking my brother...

149
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:52,136
because it feels good to keep our
son safe from hateful hypocrites.

150
00:21:54,941 --> 00:21:56,707
I killed your High Sparrow...

151
00:21:58,678 --> 00:22:00,845
<i>and all his little sparrows...</i>

152
00:22:02,515 --> 00:22:05,783
all his septons, all his septas,

153
00:22:05,885 --> 00:22:08,719
all his filthy soldiers,

154
00:22:08,821 --> 00:22:12,023
because it felt good
to watch them burn.

155
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,695
It felt good to imagine
their shock and their pain.

156
00:22:17,797 --> 00:22:21,132
No thought has ever
given me greater joy.

157
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:30,341
Even confessing feels good
under the right circumstances.

158
00:22:36,516 --> 00:22:38,549
You've always been quiet.

159
00:22:46,526 --> 00:22:49,493
I said my face would be the last
thing you saw before you died.

160
00:22:49,596 --> 00:22:51,662
Do you remember?

161
00:22:51,764 --> 00:22:53,731
Good.

162
00:22:56,002 --> 00:22:58,269
I'm glad to see your face.

163
00:23:01,174 --> 00:23:03,107
I'm ready to meet the gods.

164
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:04,542
What?

165
00:23:06,546 --> 00:23:08,479
Now?

166
00:23:08,581 --> 00:23:10,047
Today?

167
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:15,553
You're not going to die today.

168
00:23:18,057 --> 00:23:20,524
You're not going to die
for quite a while.

169
00:23:22,962 --> 00:23:24,929
Ser Gregor.

170
00:23:28,968 --> 00:23:31,235
<i>This is Ser Gregor Clegane.</i>

171
00:23:31,337 --> 00:23:33,938
He's quiet, too.

172
00:23:45,051 --> 00:23:46,684
Your gods have forsaken you.

173
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,054
This is your god now.

174
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:03,067
No.

175
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,336
No.

176
00:24:06,873 --> 00:24:10,107
Shame.

177
00:24:10,209 --> 00:24:13,444
Shame.

178
00:24:13,546 --> 00:24:17,248
Shame.

179
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:24,655
<i>I'm very sorry, Your Grace.</i>

180
00:24:26,192 --> 00:24:27,958
Very sorry.

181
00:25:11,738 --> 00:25:14,105
<i>For House Lannister!</i>

182
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:16,140
<i>Hear me roar!</i>

183
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:23,981
For House Frey!

184
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:27,151
We stand together!

185
00:25:27,253 --> 00:25:30,121
May we stand together
through the centuries,

186
00:25:30,223 --> 00:25:32,690
good friends to the last.

187
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:36,827
And when we drive our swords
through our enemies' hearts,

188
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:40,731
may we speak the words
of our alliance,

189
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:44,235
"The Freys and the Lannisters

190
00:25:44,337 --> 00:25:46,537
send their regards."

191
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:06,357
You don't even have
to do anything, do you?

192
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,027
You just sit there,
a rich slab of beef,

193
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:11,562
and all the birds come pecking.

194
00:26:11,664 --> 00:26:14,064
- You're welcome to her.
- She doesn't want me.

195
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:16,567
She wants your golden
fingers up her twat.

196
00:26:18,438 --> 00:26:20,538
Those two have their eyes on you.

197
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:24,408
They have their eyes on you, cunt.

198
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,310
Not my type.

199
00:26:26,412 --> 00:26:27,978
Not blonde enough?

200
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:33,884
Ladies, have you met
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,

201
00:26:33,986 --> 00:26:36,153
hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay?

202
00:26:36,255 --> 00:26:38,622
- There you go.
- Maybe I'm not in the mood.

203
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:43,427
Fuck it.

204
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:46,697
No need to call me ser just
because I'm an anointed knight.

205
00:26:52,004 --> 00:26:54,438
This came together rather well.

206
00:26:56,175 --> 00:26:58,342
Your father would be pleased.

207
00:26:58,444 --> 00:27:00,110
I'm sure he would be.

208
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:05,583
Edmure is back in a cell.

209
00:27:05,685 --> 00:27:09,320
Can't go killing my son by law.
It wouldn't be right.

210
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:11,589
Give the family a bad name.

211
00:27:15,061 --> 00:27:18,996
So the famous Blackfish
killed by foot soldiers, eh?

212
00:27:19,098 --> 00:27:21,999
Legendary warrior, everyone said.

213
00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:25,769
Have you done much fighting
yourself, Lord Frey?

214
00:27:25,872 --> 00:27:28,405
I'm a bit old for all that.

215
00:27:28,508 --> 00:27:31,208
No, but back in your day.

216
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:34,245
The purpose of fighting

217
00:27:34,347 --> 00:27:37,548
is defeating your enemies, isn't it?

218
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,650
I've defeated mine.

219
00:27:39,752 --> 00:27:43,454
Riverrun belonged to House
Tully for a thousand years.

220
00:27:43,556 --> 00:27:45,122
Now it's mine.

221
00:27:45,224 --> 00:27:47,525
What do you call that?

222
00:27:47,627 --> 00:27:48,893
Victory.

223
00:27:48,995 --> 00:27:51,495
Yes, you're a great conqueror.

224
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:56,867
Go on, mock me, boy.
You think I mind?

225
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:59,703
The Tullys mocked me for years.

226
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:01,972
The Starks mocked me.

227
00:28:02,074 --> 00:28:03,541
Where are they now?

228
00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:06,110
<i>You talk about war
as if you're an expert,</i>

229
00:28:06,212 --> 00:28:08,512
but the one battle
I remember you fighting,

230
00:28:08,614 --> 00:28:11,515
you were captured by Robb
Stark, the Young Wolf.

231
00:28:11,617 --> 00:28:14,518
<i>But it doesn't matter.</i>

232
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,955
Here we are now, two kingslayers.

233
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:21,926
We know what it's like to
have them grovel to our faces

234
00:28:22,028 --> 00:28:25,029
and snigger behind our backs.

235
00:28:25,131 --> 00:28:26,697
We don't mind, do we?

236
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,768
Fear is a marvelous thing.

237
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,469
They don't fear the Freys, though.

238
00:28:32,572 --> 00:28:35,306
They fear the Lannisters.

239
00:28:35,408 --> 00:28:37,775
We gave you the Riverlands
to hold the Riverlands.

240
00:28:37,877 --> 00:28:40,311
If we have to ride north
and take them back for you

241
00:28:40,413 --> 00:28:42,813
every time you lose them,

242
00:28:42,915 --> 00:28:44,882
why do we need you?

243
00:29:06,572 --> 00:29:08,238
Show me.

244
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:13,010
Your Grace,
there's no need--

245
00:29:13,112 --> 00:29:14,478
Show me.

246
00:29:27,393 --> 00:29:30,794
What are your thoughts
concerning the king's funeral?

247
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:33,564
As the Sept of Baelor
is no longer an option,

248
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:37,434
<i>perhaps a ceremony
in the throne room?</i>

249
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:42,039
He should be with his grandfather,

250
00:29:42,141 --> 00:29:44,975
his brother, his sister.

251
00:29:47,413 --> 00:29:50,080
Burn him

252
00:29:50,182 --> 00:29:53,150
and bury his ashes
where the sept once stood.

253
00:30:05,765 --> 00:30:08,098
Whoa, whoa.

254
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:52,242
Hello.

255
00:30:59,018 --> 00:31:02,720
From Lord Commander Snow
at Castle Black.

256
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:19,603
I'm--

257
00:31:19,705 --> 00:31:21,205
I'm to be the new maester.

258
00:31:36,555 --> 00:31:37,688
Oh.

259
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:40,190
According to our records,

260
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:42,059
Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.

261
00:31:43,462 --> 00:31:45,195
He died.

262
00:31:45,297 --> 00:31:47,865
We received no report from
the maester at Castle Black.

263
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:51,101
Maester Aemon became quite ill
shortly after the election.

264
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:53,470
He's since passed away.

265
00:31:55,674 --> 00:31:57,608
Which is why I'm here.

266
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,813
This is irregular.

267
00:32:02,915 --> 00:32:07,584
Yes, well, I suppose
that life is irregular.

268
00:32:19,165 --> 00:32:23,267
The archmaester will discuss
these irregularities with you.

269
00:32:25,838 --> 00:32:28,872
In the meantime, you are
permitted to use the library.

270
00:32:28,974 --> 00:32:30,841
Follow me.

271
00:32:33,813 --> 00:32:35,813
No women or children.

272
00:34:30,062 --> 00:34:32,362
When we had feasts,

273
00:34:32,464 --> 00:34:34,731
our family would sit up here...

274
00:34:36,735 --> 00:34:38,635
and I'd sit down there.

275
00:34:40,973 --> 00:34:43,540
Could have been worse, Jon Snow.

276
00:34:43,642 --> 00:34:45,409
You had a family.

277
00:34:45,511 --> 00:34:46,677
You had feasts.

278
00:34:48,847 --> 00:34:51,982
Aye, you're right.
I was luckier than most.

279
00:35:07,433 --> 00:35:09,099
What is that?

280
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:12,669
Tell him.

281
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:17,908
<i>Tell him who it belonged to.</i>

282
00:35:22,781 --> 00:35:24,381
The Princess Shireen.

283
00:35:24,483 --> 00:35:26,783
Tell him what you did to her.

284
00:35:28,654 --> 00:35:29,953
Tell him!

285
00:35:36,662 --> 00:35:38,362
We burned her at the stake.

286
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,844
Why?

287
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:57,047
The army was trapped.
The horses were dying.

288
00:35:57,149 --> 00:36:00,217
- It was the only way.
- You burned a little girl alive!

289
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:01,752
I only do what my Lord commands.

290
00:36:01,854 --> 00:36:04,988
If he commands you to burn
children, your Lord is evil.

291
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:09,993
We are standing here because of him.

292
00:36:11,497 --> 00:36:14,765
<i>Jon Snow is alive
because the Lord willed it.</i>

293
00:36:14,867 --> 00:36:18,468
I loved that girl
like she was my own.

294
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:21,872
She was good. She was kind.
And you killed her!

295
00:36:24,076 --> 00:36:25,542
So did her father.

296
00:36:27,846 --> 00:36:29,312
So did her mother.

297
00:36:31,517 --> 00:36:33,750
<i>Her own blood knew
it was the only way.</i>

298
00:36:33,852 --> 00:36:36,453
The only way for what?

299
00:36:36,555 --> 00:36:38,055
They all died anyway.

300
00:36:39,925 --> 00:36:41,925
You told everyone
Stannis was the one.

301
00:36:42,027 --> 00:36:44,361
You had him believing it,
all of them fooled.

302
00:36:44,463 --> 00:36:46,930
- And you lied.
- I didn't lie.

303
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,000
I was wrong.

304
00:36:50,102 --> 00:36:53,336
<i>Aye, you were wrong.</i>

305
00:36:53,439 --> 00:36:57,074
How many died because you were wrong?

306
00:37:02,047 --> 00:37:05,949
I ask your leave to execute
this woman for murder.

307
00:37:06,051 --> 00:37:07,851
<i>She admits to the crime.</i>

308
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:12,756
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

309
00:37:14,626 --> 00:37:17,360
I've been ready
to die for many years.

310
00:37:19,164 --> 00:37:22,199
If the Lord was done with
me, so be it, but he's not.

311
00:37:22,301 --> 00:37:25,502
You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow.

312
00:37:25,604 --> 00:37:28,872
You know the great war
is still to come.

313
00:37:28,974 --> 00:37:31,942
You know the army of the
dead will be upon us soon.

314
00:37:33,178 --> 00:37:35,745
And you know I can
help you win that war.

315
00:37:50,028 --> 00:37:51,895
Ride south today.

316
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:55,298
If you return to the North,

317
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,001
I'll have you hanged as a murderer.

318
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:18,355
If you ever come back this way,

319
00:38:18,457 --> 00:38:20,824
I will execute you myself.

320
00:38:52,824 --> 00:38:55,625
I'm having the lord's
chamber prepared for you.

321
00:38:57,362 --> 00:38:59,396
Mother and Father's room?

322
00:39:00,866 --> 00:39:02,699
You should take it.

323
00:39:04,102 --> 00:39:06,069
I'm not a Stark.

324
00:39:06,171 --> 00:39:08,572
You are to me.

325
00:39:12,244 --> 00:39:13,910
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

326
00:39:14,012 --> 00:39:17,914
You deserve it. We're
standing here because of you.

327
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:21,518
<i>The battle was lost until the
Knights of the Vale rode in.</i>

328
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,820
They came because of you.

329
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:30,760
You told me Lord Baelish
sold you to the Boltons.

330
00:39:30,862 --> 00:39:32,629
- He did.
- And you trust him?

331
00:39:32,731 --> 00:39:36,366
Only a fool would trust Littlefinger.

332
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:42,272
I should have told you about him,

333
00:39:42,374 --> 00:39:45,709
about the Knights of the Vale.

334
00:39:45,811 --> 00:39:47,277
I'm sorry.

335
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,557
We need to trust each other.

336
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:03,660
We can't fight a war
amongst ourselves.

337
00:40:03,762 --> 00:40:06,263
We have so many enemies now.

338
00:40:22,514 --> 00:40:24,547
Jon.

339
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:28,084
A raven came from the Citadel.

340
00:40:28,186 --> 00:40:30,086
A white raven.

341
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:34,324
Winter is here.

342
00:40:46,605 --> 00:40:49,739
Well, Father always
promised, didn't he?

343
00:41:03,822 --> 00:41:06,990
The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne,

344
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:09,192
he was assassinated.

345
00:41:09,294 --> 00:41:11,861
100 red scorpions, was it?

346
00:41:11,963 --> 00:41:14,464
You have nothing to fear
from us, Lady Olenna.

347
00:41:14,566 --> 00:41:16,700
You murder your own prince,

348
00:41:16,802 --> 00:41:18,535
but you expect me to trust you?

349
00:41:18,637 --> 00:41:21,604
We invited you to Dorne
because we needed your help.

350
00:41:21,707 --> 00:41:23,973
You came to Dorne because
you needed our help.

351
00:41:24,076 --> 00:41:26,576
What is your name again?

352
00:41:26,678 --> 00:41:28,044
Barbaro?

353
00:41:28,146 --> 00:41:29,746
Obara.

354
00:41:29,848 --> 00:41:32,982
Obara. You look like
an angry little boy.

355
00:41:33,085 --> 00:41:35,719
<i>Don't presume to tell me what I need.</i>

356
00:41:35,821 --> 00:41:39,155
Forgive my sister. What she
lacks in diplomacy, she makes--

357
00:41:39,257 --> 00:41:42,759
Do shut up, dear.
Anything from you?

358
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:44,761
No? Good.

359
00:41:44,863 --> 00:41:47,263
Let the grown women speak.

360
00:41:47,366 --> 00:41:51,067
The Lannisters have declared
war on House Tyrell.

361
00:41:51,169 --> 00:41:54,137
They have declared war on Dorne.

362
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:57,874
We must be allies now
if we wish to survive.

363
00:41:59,177 --> 00:42:02,145
Cersei stole the future from me.

364
00:42:02,247 --> 00:42:04,013
She killed my son.

365
00:42:04,116 --> 00:42:06,149
<i>She killed my grandson.</i>

366
00:42:06,251 --> 00:42:09,452
She killed my granddaughter.

367
00:42:09,554 --> 00:42:12,389
Survival is not what I'm after now.

368
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:14,657
You're absolutely right.

369
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,327
I chose the wrong words.

370
00:42:17,429 --> 00:42:19,929
It is not survival I offer.

371
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,365
It is your heart's desire.

372
00:42:24,202 --> 00:42:27,404
And what is my heart's desire?

373
00:42:28,974 --> 00:42:31,207
Vengeance.

374
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:32,409
Justice.

375
00:42:36,148 --> 00:42:38,014
Fire and blood.

376
00:42:44,489 --> 00:42:47,290
Your ships are nearly ready.

377
00:42:47,392 --> 00:42:49,692
I saw them painting the sails.

378
00:42:53,131 --> 00:42:56,933
I'm curious to see how the
Dothraki do on the poison water.

379
00:42:57,035 --> 00:42:58,935
You're not coming with us.

380
00:43:01,306 --> 00:43:04,541
New strategy?

381
00:43:04,643 --> 00:43:07,844
You want the Second Sons to
attack from the west coast?

382
00:43:07,946 --> 00:43:10,547
If we take Casterly Rock,

383
00:43:10,649 --> 00:43:14,217
the Lannisters will have nowhere to
run when you hit King's Landing.

384
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,252
You're not going to Westeros.

385
00:43:16,354 --> 00:43:19,289
You're staying here
with the Second Sons.

386
00:43:19,391 --> 00:43:22,025
There's finally peace in Meereen.

387
00:43:22,127 --> 00:43:25,462
You will keep the peace while the
people choose their own leaders.

388
00:43:26,765 --> 00:43:28,565
Fuck Meereen.

389
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:30,567
Fuck the people.

390
00:43:30,669 --> 00:43:32,936
I'm here for you, not them.

391
00:43:33,038 --> 00:43:34,704
You promised me.

392
00:43:34,806 --> 00:43:37,740
"My sword is yours.
My life is yours."

393
00:43:37,843 --> 00:43:40,944
<i>This is what I command.</i>

394
00:43:41,046 --> 00:43:44,047
If I'm going to rule in Westeros,

395
00:43:44,149 --> 00:43:46,649
I'll need to make alliances.

396
00:43:46,751 --> 00:43:50,119
The best way to make
alliances is with marriage.

397
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:55,291
Who are you marrying this time?

398
00:43:55,393 --> 00:43:58,761
I don't know.
Maybe no one.

399
00:43:58,864 --> 00:44:01,965
But you need to lure all the
noble houses to the table?

400
00:44:02,067 --> 00:44:04,033
Are you a queen or fish bait?

401
00:44:06,471 --> 00:44:09,439
I can't bring a lover to Westeros.

402
00:44:09,541 --> 00:44:11,774
A king wouldn't think twice about it.

403
00:44:11,877 --> 00:44:14,777
So that's what you want?
To be my mistress?

404
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,181
I'm not proud. I don't care
what perfumed aristocrat

405
00:44:18,283 --> 00:44:20,383
sits beside you in the throne room.

406
00:44:20,485 --> 00:44:23,520
I don't want a crown.
I want you.

407
00:44:30,495 --> 00:44:32,695
I love you.

408
00:44:32,797 --> 00:44:35,265
And I make you happy.

409
00:44:35,367 --> 00:44:37,233
You know I do.

410
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:43,172
Bring me with you.
Let me fight for you.

411
00:44:50,782 --> 00:44:52,048
I can't.

412
00:45:01,793 --> 00:45:03,526
The dwarf told you to do this?

413
00:45:03,628 --> 00:45:05,295
<i>No one tells me to do anything.</i>

414
00:45:05,397 --> 00:45:08,565
Clever fellow.
Can't argue with his logic.

415
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,400
I'm no use to you over there.

416
00:45:10,502 --> 00:45:11,768
Don't get angry.

417
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:15,038
I'm not angry.
I'm full of self-pity.

418
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,739
Who comes after you?

419
00:45:16,841 --> 00:45:20,009
Who can ever follow Daenerys
Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?

420
00:45:20,111 --> 00:45:22,378
A great number of women, I imagine.

421
00:45:28,587 --> 00:45:30,420
Specific orders will be left for you

422
00:45:30,522 --> 00:45:33,456
regarding the welfare of Meereen
and the Bay of Dragons.

423
00:45:33,558 --> 00:45:35,358
Bay of Dragons?

424
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,461
We can't call it Slaver's
Bay anymore, can we?

425
00:45:41,466 --> 00:45:44,767
You'll get that throne you
want so badly, I'm sure of it.

426
00:45:46,104 --> 00:45:48,304
I hope it brings you happiness.

427
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:55,979
I pity the lords of Westeros.

428
00:45:56,081 --> 00:45:58,247
They have no idea
what's coming for them.

429
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:02,285
Farewell, Daario Naharis.

430
00:46:20,972 --> 00:46:23,272
How did he take it?

431
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:25,441
No tears.

432
00:46:27,512 --> 00:46:30,146
I know it was hard for you.

433
00:46:30,248 --> 00:46:32,281
You turned away a man
who truly loves you

434
00:46:32,384 --> 00:46:35,284
because he would have been a
liability in the Seven Kingdoms.

435
00:46:37,856 --> 00:46:41,557
That's the kind of self-sacrifice
that makes for a good ruler,

436
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,826
if it's any consolation.

437
00:46:46,731 --> 00:46:48,531
It's not.

438
00:46:48,633 --> 00:46:50,933
No, I suppose not.

439
00:46:51,036 --> 00:46:52,568
I'm terrible at consoling.

440
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,971
Yes, you really are.

441
00:46:58,143 --> 00:47:02,345
All right, how about the fact
that this is actually happening?

442
00:47:03,848 --> 00:47:06,716
You have your armies,
you have your ships,

443
00:47:06,818 --> 00:47:08,818
you have your dragons.

444
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,887
Everything you've ever wanted

445
00:47:10,989 --> 00:47:13,890
since you were old enough
to want anything,

446
00:47:13,992 --> 00:47:15,858
it's all yours for the taking.

447
00:47:17,629 --> 00:47:19,562
Are you afraid?

448
00:47:22,734 --> 00:47:24,600
Good.

449
00:47:24,703 --> 00:47:27,437
You're in the great game now.

450
00:47:27,539 --> 00:47:30,106
And the great game's terrifying.

451
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:32,675
The only people who
aren't afraid of failure

452
00:47:32,777 --> 00:47:34,877
are madmen like your father.

453
00:47:36,981 --> 00:47:39,082
Do you know what frightens me?

454
00:47:40,552 --> 00:47:43,219
I said farewell
to a man who loves me.

455
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:48,658
A man I thought I cared for.

456
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,727
And I felt nothing.

457
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:54,230
Just impatient to get on with it.

458
00:47:57,335 --> 00:48:00,403
He wasn't the first to love you

459
00:48:00,505 --> 00:48:02,572
and he won't be the last.

460
00:48:06,478 --> 00:48:11,380
Well, you have completely
failed to console me.

461
00:48:13,952 --> 00:48:16,419
For what it's worth,
I've been a cynic

462
00:48:16,521 --> 00:48:18,654
for as long as I can remember.

463
00:48:18,757 --> 00:48:21,557
Everyone's always asking me
to believe in things--

464
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:25,394
family, gods, kings, myself.

465
00:48:25,497 --> 00:48:27,330
It was often tempting

466
00:48:27,432 --> 00:48:29,766
until I saw where belief got people.

467
00:48:31,136 --> 00:48:33,736
So I said no, thank you to belief.

468
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:37,140
And yet here I am.

469
00:48:39,844 --> 00:48:42,111
I believe in you.

470
00:48:44,048 --> 00:48:46,449
It's embarrassing, really.

471
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,319
I'd swear you my sword,

472
00:48:50,421 --> 00:48:53,456
but I don't actually own a sword.

473
00:48:53,558 --> 00:48:55,558
It's your counsel I need.

474
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:58,094
It's yours.

475
00:48:58,196 --> 00:48:59,629
Now and always.

476
00:49:01,132 --> 00:49:02,965
Good.

477
00:49:04,269 --> 00:49:06,302
I, um...

478
00:49:06,404 --> 00:49:08,171
I had something made for you.

479
00:49:09,874 --> 00:49:12,408
I'm not sure if it's right.

480
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:24,420
Tyrion Lannister,

481
00:49:24,522 --> 00:49:26,422
I name you Hand of the Queen.

482
00:50:00,658 --> 00:50:03,192
You're not one of mine, are you?

483
00:50:03,294 --> 00:50:04,794
No, my lord.

484
00:50:04,896 --> 00:50:06,562
Didn't think so.

485
00:50:06,664 --> 00:50:08,898
Too pretty.

486
00:50:13,171 --> 00:50:15,972
Where are my damn moron sons?

487
00:50:16,074 --> 00:50:19,809
Black Walder and Lothar
promised to be here by midday.

488
00:50:19,911 --> 00:50:21,744
They're here, my lord.

489
00:50:21,846 --> 00:50:25,147
Well, what are they doing,
trimming their cunt hairs?

490
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:27,316
Tell them to come here now.

491
00:50:27,418 --> 00:50:29,685
But they're already here, my lord.

492
00:50:33,725 --> 00:50:36,726
Here, my lord.

493
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:57,046
They weren't easy to carve.

494
00:50:58,716 --> 00:51:00,616
Especially Black Walder.

495
00:51:00,718 --> 00:51:03,286
What...

496
00:51:10,695 --> 00:51:12,361
My name is Arya Stark.

497
00:51:12,463 --> 00:51:13,963
I want you to know that.

498
00:51:14,065 --> 00:51:16,799
The last thing
you're ever going to see

499
00:51:16,901 --> 00:51:19,635
is a Stark smiling down
at you as you die.

500
00:52:14,425 --> 00:52:16,425
Forgive me, my lady...

501
00:52:17,862 --> 00:52:20,863
if you're at prayer.

502
00:52:20,965 --> 00:52:22,965
I'm done with all that.

503
00:52:25,169 --> 00:52:27,703
I came here every day
when I was a girl.

504
00:52:29,407 --> 00:52:32,241
I prayed to be somewhere else.

505
00:52:32,343 --> 00:52:34,443
Back then I only thought
about what I wanted,

506
00:52:34,545 --> 00:52:36,379
never about what I had.

507
00:52:40,151 --> 00:52:41,584
I was a stupid girl.

508
00:52:41,686 --> 00:52:43,619
You were a child.

509
00:52:46,924 --> 00:52:49,392
What do you want?

510
00:52:49,494 --> 00:52:51,861
I thought you knew what I wanted.

511
00:52:51,963 --> 00:52:53,562
I was wrong.

512
00:52:53,664 --> 00:52:56,332
No, you weren't.

513
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:00,636
Every time I'm faced with a decision,

514
00:53:00,738 --> 00:53:02,972
I close my eyes and see
the same picture.

515
00:53:04,675 --> 00:53:08,077
Whenever I consider
an action, I ask myself

516
00:53:08,179 --> 00:53:12,314
will this action help to make
this picture a reality?

517
00:53:14,285 --> 00:53:17,053
Pull it out of my mind

518
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:18,988
and into the world?

519
00:53:21,092 --> 00:53:24,060
And I only act if the answer is yes.

520
00:53:26,831 --> 00:53:31,400
A picture of me on the Iron Throne...

521
00:53:34,205 --> 00:53:36,105
and you by my side.

522
00:53:46,184 --> 00:53:48,084
It's a pretty picture.

523
00:53:53,624 --> 00:53:57,126
News of this battle will spread
quickly through the Seven Kingdoms.

524
00:53:57,228 --> 00:54:00,729
I've declared for House
Stark for all to hear.

525
00:54:00,832 --> 00:54:03,299
You've declared for other
houses before, Lord Baelish.

526
00:54:03,401 --> 00:54:06,102
It's never stopped you
from serving yourself.

527
00:54:06,204 --> 00:54:08,404
The past is gone for good.

528
00:54:08,506 --> 00:54:10,573
You can sit here
mourning its departure

529
00:54:10,675 --> 00:54:13,609
or you can prepare for the future.

530
00:54:13,711 --> 00:54:16,178
You, my love,

531
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,914
are the future of House Stark.

532
00:54:19,016 --> 00:54:22,685
Who should the North rally behind?

533
00:54:22,787 --> 00:54:25,454
A trueborn daughter
of Ned and Catelyn Stark

534
00:54:25,556 --> 00:54:27,456
born here at Winterfell

535
00:54:27,558 --> 00:54:30,759
or a motherless bastard
born in the south?

536
00:54:57,221 --> 00:54:59,455
This is where I leave you.

537
00:54:59,557 --> 00:55:01,357
You're not coming with us?

538
00:55:02,827 --> 00:55:06,228
The Wall is not just ice and stone.

539
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:09,498
Ancient spells were carved
into its foundations.

540
00:55:11,302 --> 00:55:13,369
Strong magic

541
00:55:13,471 --> 00:55:16,605
to protect men from what lies beyond.

542
00:55:16,707 --> 00:55:20,543
And while it stands,
the dead cannot pass.

543
00:55:20,645 --> 00:55:21,645
I cannot pass.

544
00:55:38,362 --> 00:55:40,296
Where will you go?

545
00:55:40,398 --> 00:55:41,931
The great war is coming

546
00:55:42,033 --> 00:55:44,833
<i>and I still fight for the living.</i>

547
00:55:46,904 --> 00:55:49,004
I'll do what I can...

548
00:55:50,374 --> 00:55:52,575
as long as I can.

549
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,581
Thank you, Uncle Benjen.

550
00:55:58,683 --> 00:56:01,016
I wish you both good fortune.

551
00:56:40,291 --> 00:56:42,825
Are you sure you're ready for this?

552
00:56:42,927 --> 00:56:46,028
I'm the Three-Eyed
Raven now.

553
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:48,364
I have to be ready for this.

554
00:57:21,966 --> 00:57:24,600
<i>Ned?</i>

555
00:57:24,702 --> 00:57:27,202
Lyanna.

556
00:57:27,305 --> 00:57:29,405
Is that you?

557
00:57:33,177 --> 00:57:35,177
Is that really you?

558
00:57:40,117 --> 00:57:42,017
You're not a dream?

559
00:57:43,154 --> 00:57:45,254
No, I'm not a dream.

560
00:57:46,924 --> 00:57:48,791
I'm here.

561
00:57:50,461 --> 00:57:52,227
Right here.

562
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:54,663
I've missed you, big brother.

563
00:57:58,002 --> 00:58:00,002
I've missed you, too.

564
00:58:04,342 --> 00:58:06,241
I want to be brave.

565
00:58:06,344 --> 00:58:08,777
Shh.

566
00:58:08,879 --> 00:58:11,380
You are.

567
00:58:11,482 --> 00:58:14,216
I'm not.

568
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:19,188
I don't want to die.

569
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:21,523
You're not going to die.

570
00:58:25,329 --> 00:58:27,162
Get her some water.

571
00:58:27,264 --> 00:58:29,565
- No, no water.
- Is there a maester?

572
00:58:29,667 --> 00:58:32,000
Listen to me, Ned.

573
00:58:38,409 --> 00:58:41,143
If Robert
finds out, he'll--

574
00:58:41,245 --> 00:58:43,112
you know he will.

575
00:58:43,214 --> 00:58:45,080
You have to protect him.

576
00:58:48,152 --> 00:58:50,052
Promise me, Ned.

577
00:58:52,456 --> 00:58:54,323
Promise me.

578
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:08,437
Promise me, Ned.

579
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:14,710
Promise me.

580
00:59:45,276 --> 00:59:48,177
You can't expect Knights of the Vale

581
00:59:48,279 --> 00:59:50,913
to side with wildling invaders.

582
00:59:51,015 --> 00:59:54,950
We didn't invade.
We were invited.

583
00:59:55,052 --> 00:59:56,752
Not by me.

584
00:59:56,854 --> 00:59:58,654
The free folk, the northerners,

585
00:59:58,756 --> 01:00:01,123
and the Knights of the Vale
fought bravely,

586
01:00:01,225 --> 01:00:03,525
fought together, and we won.

587
01:00:03,627 --> 01:00:08,363
My father used to say we find our
true friends on the battlefield.

588
01:00:08,466 --> 01:00:11,066
The Boltons are defeated.

589
01:00:11,168 --> 01:00:13,101
The war is over.

590
01:00:13,204 --> 01:00:15,103
Winter has come.

591
01:00:15,206 --> 01:00:18,707
If the maesters are right, it'll be
the coldest one in a thousand years.

592
01:00:18,809 --> 01:00:22,244
We should ride home
and wait out the coming storms.

593
01:00:22,346 --> 01:00:24,446
The war is not over.

594
01:00:24,548 --> 01:00:26,582
And I promise you, friend,

595
01:00:26,684 --> 01:00:29,618
the true enemy
won't wait out the storm.

596
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,220
He brings the storm.

597
01:00:51,208 --> 01:00:55,277
Your son was butchered at the
Red Wedding, Lord Manderly,

598
01:00:55,379 --> 01:00:57,212
but you refused the call.

599
01:01:00,551 --> 01:01:03,552
You swore allegiance
to House Stark, Lord Glover,

600
01:01:03,654 --> 01:01:06,255
but in their hour of greatest need,

601
01:01:06,357 --> 01:01:08,357
you refused the call.

602
01:01:10,461 --> 01:01:12,494
<i>And you, Lord Cerwyn,</i>

603
01:01:12,596 --> 01:01:16,465
your father was skinned
alive by Ramsay Bolton.

604
01:01:16,567 --> 01:01:19,034
Still you refused the call.

605
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:26,008
<i>But House Mormont remembers.</i>

606
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:28,810
The North remembers.

607
01:01:28,913 --> 01:01:33,482
We know no king but the King in
the North whose name is Stark.

608
01:01:35,252 --> 01:01:37,019
<i>I don't care if he's a bastard.</i>

609
01:01:37,121 --> 01:01:39,721
<i>Ned Stark's blood
runs through his veins.</i>

610
01:01:39,823 --> 01:01:44,293
He's my king from this
day until his last day.

611
01:02:00,978 --> 01:02:03,545
Lady Mormont speaks harshly

612
01:02:03,647 --> 01:02:04,947
and truly.

613
01:02:08,352 --> 01:02:13,455
My son died for Robb Stark,
the Young Wolf.

614
01:02:13,557 --> 01:02:16,625
I didn't think we'd find
another king in my lifetime.

615
01:02:16,727 --> 01:02:19,161
I didn't commit my men to your cause

616
01:02:19,263 --> 01:02:21,897
'cause I didn't want more
Manderlys dying for nothing.

617
01:02:24,168 --> 01:02:25,634
But I was wrong.

618
01:02:31,342 --> 01:02:33,575
Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding.

619
01:02:33,677 --> 01:02:36,078
<i>He is the White Wolf.</i>

620
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:39,114
The King in the North.

621
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:49,057
I did not fight
beside you on the field

622
01:02:49,159 --> 01:02:52,594
and I will regret that
until my dying day.

623
01:02:52,696 --> 01:02:57,332
<i>A man can only admit
when he was wrong</i>

624
01:02:57,434 --> 01:02:59,001
and ask forgiveness.

625
01:03:02,006 --> 01:03:04,306
There's nothing to forgive, my lord.

626
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:09,411
There will be more fights to come.

627
01:03:09,513 --> 01:03:13,048
House Glover will stand
behind House Stark

628
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:15,450
as we have for a thousand years.

629
01:03:17,287 --> 01:03:19,521
And I will stand behind Jon Snow...

630
01:03:21,959 --> 01:03:24,026
the King in the North!

631
01:03:25,929 --> 01:03:28,830
The King in the North!

632
01:03:28,932 --> 01:03:32,234
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

633
01:03:32,336 --> 01:03:35,671
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

634
01:03:35,773 --> 01:03:38,974
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

635
01:03:39,076 --> 01:03:42,577
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

636
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:46,348
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

637
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:50,318
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

638
01:03:50,421 --> 01:03:53,288
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

639
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:56,558
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

640
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:59,861
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

641
01:03:59,963 --> 01:04:03,265
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

642
01:04:03,367 --> 01:04:06,201
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

643
01:04:12,409 --> 01:04:14,409
<i>Company halt!</i>

644
01:04:17,414 --> 01:04:18,880
<i>Halt!</i>

645
01:04:20,751 --> 01:04:22,884
<i>Halt!</i>

646
01:04:34,431 --> 01:04:35,564
Come on.

647
01:05:30,554 --> 01:05:34,322
I now proclaim Cersei
of the House Lannister

648
01:05:34,424 --> 01:05:37,058
First of Her Name,

649
01:05:37,161 --> 01:05:40,529
<i>Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,</i>

650
01:05:40,631 --> 01:05:43,832
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.

651
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,746
<i>Long may she reign.</i>

652
01:06:31,849 --> 01:06:34,015
<i>Long may she reign.</i>
