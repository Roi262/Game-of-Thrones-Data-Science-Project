2
00:01:58,804 --> 00:02:01,470
- We shouldn't be out here alone.
- Why not?

3
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:04,178
- If your father--
- He'll never know we're gone.

4
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:06,246
But if he finds out...

5
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:12,763
You don't need
to be afraid of my father.

6
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:42,303
Are you sure?

7
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,095
Yes.

8
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,304
- We shouldn't go in.
- Of course we should.

9
00:03:31,513 --> 00:03:34,762
Get out.
Get out!

10
00:03:34,763 --> 00:03:36,720
- Let's go.
- No.

11
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:38,496
Listen to your friend.

12
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:41,553
They said that you
were terrifying

13
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:45,637
with cat's teeth and three eyes.

14
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:47,513
You're not terrifying.

15
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:51,012
You're boring.

16
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:53,114
You don't know what I am.

17
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:56,632
I know you're a witch
and you can see the future.

18
00:03:58,013 --> 00:03:59,928
Tell me mine.

19
00:03:59,929 --> 00:04:02,220
Everyone wants
to know their future

20
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:04,345
until they know their future.

21
00:04:04,346 --> 00:04:07,720
This is my father's land.
My land.

22
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:12,765
Tell me my future or I'll have your two
boring eyes gouged out of your head.

23
00:04:22,403 --> 00:04:25,012
Your blood.

24
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:26,554
Give me a taste.

25
00:04:51,888 --> 00:04:53,835
Three questions you get.

26
00:04:54,396 --> 00:04:56,846
You won't like the answers.

27
00:05:00,513 --> 00:05:03,220
I've been promised
to the prince.

28
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:06,345
When will we marry?

29
00:05:06,346 --> 00:05:08,021
You will never wed the prince.

30
00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:10,012
You will wed the king.

31
00:05:10,013 --> 00:05:11,470
But I will be queen?

32
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:13,887
Oh, yes.

33
00:05:13,888 --> 00:05:16,220
You'll be queen.

34
00:05:16,221 --> 00:05:18,095
For a time.

35
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:21,178
Then comes another,

36
00:05:21,179 --> 00:05:22,678
younger,

37
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:25,303
<i>more beautiful,</i>

38
00:05:25,304 --> 00:05:28,595
<i>to cast you down</i>
<i>and take all you hold dear.</i>

39
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:31,803
W-will the king and I
have children?

40
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:37,199
No. The king will have 20
children and you will have three.

41
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,303
That doesn't make sense.

42
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:41,762
Gold will be their crowns.

43
00:05:41,763 --> 00:05:44,638
Gold their shrouds.

44
00:05:51,929 --> 00:05:53,470
Come on, we have to go.

45
00:05:54,263 --> 00:05:56,928
We have to go!
Cersei!

46
00:06:00,888 --> 00:06:02,887
<i>Bearers, put it down.</i>

47
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:21,595
<i>Bearers, up.</i>

48
00:06:21,596 --> 00:06:23,346
<i>Away.</i>

49
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:39,762
<i>Your Grace, we are</i>
<i>honored by your presence.</i>

50
00:06:39,763 --> 00:06:41,178
<i>The mourners are waiting.</i>

51
00:06:41,298 --> 00:06:43,693
They will keep waiting.

52
00:06:43,797 --> 00:06:45,546
I want a moment alone with him.

53
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:48,005
But, Your Grace, many of these lords
and ladies have travelled

54
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:50,171
day and night to be here from
all seven kingdoms.

55
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:51,922
They will wait.

56
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,296
He never wanted you
to be a Kingsguard,

57
00:07:21,297 --> 00:07:25,047
but here you are,
protecting his dead body.

58
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:30,797
What he built, it's ours.

59
00:07:32,006 --> 00:07:34,922
He built it for us.
He meant it for us.

60
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:38,671
They're going to try
to take it away.

61
00:07:38,672 --> 00:07:40,046
- All of it.
- They?

62
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:41,755
All of them out there,
our enemies.

63
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:44,546
They're waiting in line to make sure
he's really dead.

64
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,338
And as soon as they see
the stones on his eyes,

65
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:49,171
they'll set to work
on tearing us apart.

66
00:07:49,172 --> 00:07:51,921
They have nothing to do with it.

67
00:07:51,922 --> 00:07:54,213
The man who murdered our father,
he tore us apart.

68
00:07:54,214 --> 00:07:56,546
He's the enemy.
I've been telling you for years.

69
00:07:56,547 --> 00:07:57,588
You've been defending
him for years.

70
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:59,755
This is exactly what they want.

71
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:01,380
And now our father is dead

72
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:04,839
and that little monster
is out there somewhere drawing breath.

73
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:09,131
Did you set him free?

74
00:08:11,756 --> 00:08:13,463
Tyrion may be a monster,

75
00:08:13,464 --> 00:08:17,463
but at least he killed
our father on purpose.

76
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,588
You killed him by mistake.

77
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:21,381
With stupidity.

78
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:24,296
You're a man
of action, aren't you?

79
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:26,838
When it occurs to you
to do something, you do it.

80
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,839
Never mind the consequences.

81
00:08:31,797 --> 00:08:34,505
Take a look.

82
00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:35,506
Look at the consequences.

83
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:40,339
Here they are.

84
00:08:44,214 --> 00:08:47,506
He loved you more than
anyone in this world.

85
00:10:19,756 --> 00:10:21,589
Apologies.

86
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,963
I still don't see
why I had to stay

87
00:10:34,964 --> 00:10:37,046
in this fucking crate
once we set sail.

88
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:39,963
I saved your life.

89
00:10:39,964 --> 00:10:42,713
If they catch you,
they catch me.

90
00:10:42,714 --> 00:10:44,755
I cannot say
I feel overly guilty

91
00:10:44,756 --> 00:10:46,838
about leaving you
in that fucking crate.

92
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:49,546
Do you know what it's like
to stuff your shit

93
00:10:49,547 --> 00:10:51,213
through one of those airholes?

94
00:10:51,214 --> 00:10:52,505
No, I only know what it's like

95
00:10:52,506 --> 00:10:55,672
to pick up your shit
and throw it overboard.

96
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:01,296
Pentos?

97
00:11:01,297 --> 00:11:03,755
The home of my colleague
Illyrio Mopatis,

98
00:11:03,756 --> 00:11:06,130
a merchant.

99
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:08,088
He and I met many years ago

100
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:09,505
through mutual friends.

101
00:11:09,506 --> 00:11:12,880
A group of people
who saw Robert Baratheon

102
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,338
for the disaster he was.

103
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,380
We tried to do what
was best for the realm

104
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:20,921
by supporting
a Targaryen restoration.

105
00:11:20,922 --> 00:11:23,546
And thus began
the chain of mistakes

106
00:11:23,547 --> 00:11:26,171
that has led us both here.

107
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:29,630
Things have gotten worse,
not better.

108
00:11:29,631 --> 00:11:32,714
Westeros needs to be
saved from itself.

109
00:11:36,464 --> 00:11:38,338
Mmm.

110
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:39,796
Much better.

111
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:41,464
My lord?

112
00:11:43,506 --> 00:11:46,338
I don't think I am anymore.

113
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,547
A lord.

114
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,339
Are you a lord
if you kill your father?

115
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:04,380
I don't imagine
they revoke your nobility

116
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:06,338
for killing a whore.

117
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:08,255
It must happen all the time.

118
00:12:08,256 --> 00:12:10,671
You already drank yourself
across the Narrow Sea.

119
00:12:10,672 --> 00:12:12,255
In a box.
Why stop now?

120
00:12:12,256 --> 00:12:15,672
Because we are talking
about the future of our country.

121
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:22,256
The future is shit.

122
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:26,339
Just like the past.

123
00:14:18,386 --> 00:14:19,718
_

124
00:14:19,838 --> 00:14:22,192
_

125
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:34,400
_

126
00:14:34,863 --> 00:14:36,252
_

127
00:14:36,765 --> 00:14:38,409
_

128
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:47,713
Shh.

129
00:14:47,714 --> 00:14:49,422
Shh.

130
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:35,713
<i>The Sons of the Harpy?</i>

131
00:15:35,714 --> 00:15:38,046
Yes, Your Grace.
They left it on the body.

132
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:39,380
They've never killed before.

133
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:41,880
It was only a matter
of time, Your Grace.

134
00:15:41,881 --> 00:15:44,380
Conquerors always meet
with resistance.

135
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:46,463
I didn't conquer them.
Their own people did.

136
00:15:46,874 --> 00:15:50,341
_

137
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:54,677
_

138
00:15:54,797 --> 00:15:57,546
He did not risk his life
fighting for his freedom

139
00:15:57,547 --> 00:15:59,546
so cowards in masks
could take it away.

140
00:15:59,547 --> 00:16:01,046
And I did not take up
residence in this pyramid

141
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:04,505
so I could watch the city below
decline into chaos.

142
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:07,046
What was the name
of the man you lost?

143
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:10,505
White Rat, Your Grace.

144
00:16:10,506 --> 00:16:14,671
I want him buried
with honor, publically

145
00:16:14,672 --> 00:16:17,088
in the Temple of the Graces.

146
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:19,130
The Sons of the Harpy
will hear that message.

147
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:20,838
Make them very angry.

148
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,796
Angry snakes lash out.

149
00:16:22,797 --> 00:16:25,505
Makes chopping off their heads
that much easier.

150
00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:28,922
Find the men who did this
and bring them to me.

151
00:16:32,297 --> 00:16:33,297
Your Grace.

152
00:16:47,797 --> 00:16:49,796
Torgo Nudho.

153
00:16:49,797 --> 00:16:51,672
Missandei hin Naath.

154
00:16:53,964 --> 00:16:55,256
I wanted to speak with you.

155
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,421
Why do you come?

156
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:09,381
White Rat, the Unsullied who...

157
00:17:11,672 --> 00:17:14,881
I have heard they found
his body in a brothel.

158
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:19,046
I have heard that
more than one Unsullied

159
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:21,714
has been known to visit
Meereen's brothels.

160
00:17:24,714 --> 00:17:26,214
May I ask you why?

161
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,297
Why would an Unsullied
go to a brothel?

162
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:36,797
I do not know.

163
00:17:37,714 --> 00:17:40,339
<i>I must go.</i>

164
00:17:55,422 --> 00:17:57,546
- Get your shield up.
- It's too heavy.

165
00:17:57,547 --> 00:17:59,838
If it wasn't heavy,
it wouldn't stop a sword.

166
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:01,381
Now get it up.

167
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:16,546
Come.
Try it again.

168
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:19,671
Drive at me.
Keep your shield up.

169
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:22,130
Or I'll ring
your head like a bell.

170
00:18:22,131 --> 00:18:24,921
Shouldn't you be training, too?

171
00:18:24,922 --> 00:18:27,422
Well, I'm hardly a new recruit.

172
00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:33,255
How many brothers can say that they've
killed a white walker and a Thenn?

173
00:18:33,256 --> 00:18:36,380
I might be the first in history.

174
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,296
<i>- Shield up.</i>
<i>- These men need a firm hand.</i>

175
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:40,046
Always have.

176
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:42,214
They're poachers and thieves.

177
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:46,797
Not soldiers.

178
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,381
That one hates me.

179
00:18:56,506 --> 00:18:58,713
If Ser Alliser
is chosen as the new Lord Commander...

180
00:18:58,714 --> 00:19:02,380
He hates the wildlings.

181
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:04,171
All the wildlings.

182
00:19:04,172 --> 00:19:06,755
- Don't let them send us away.
- <i> It's not a sure thing.</i>

183
00:19:06,756 --> 00:19:09,296
Ser Denys Mallister has
commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years

184
00:19:09,297 --> 00:19:11,130
and people say he's a good man.

185
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:12,255
He's running against
Ser Alliser--

186
00:19:12,256 --> 00:19:14,880
Sam, don't let them
send us away.

187
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:16,130
I told you.

188
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:19,255
Wherever you go, I go, too.

189
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:21,547
You can't leave.
They'll execute you.

190
00:19:29,547 --> 00:19:31,507
- Good, good, pivot. Don't forget to pivot.
- Yah!

191
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,256
Shield up.

192
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:38,714
The king wants a word.

193
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:08,338
You're not cold, my lady?

194
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:10,505
Never.

195
00:20:10,506 --> 00:20:14,506
The Lord's fire lives
within me, Jon Snow.

196
00:20:17,256 --> 00:20:19,047
Feel.

197
00:20:26,297 --> 00:20:28,131
Are you a virgin?

198
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:33,672
No.

199
00:20:35,256 --> 00:20:37,131
Good.

200
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:46,296
Your Grace.

201
00:20:46,297 --> 00:20:48,506
The bastard of Winterfell.

202
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:59,339
You know who rules
at Winterfell now?

203
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:02,296
Roose Bolton.

204
00:21:02,297 --> 00:21:05,589
Mmm, the traitor who plunged a dagger
in Robb Stark's heart.

205
00:21:06,547 --> 00:21:09,131
Don't you want to avenge him?

206
00:21:10,464 --> 00:21:13,463
I want a great
many things, Your Grace.

207
00:21:13,464 --> 00:21:15,963
But I'm a sworn brother
of the Night's Watch now.

208
00:21:15,964 --> 00:21:19,296
I've been talking
to your sworn brothers.

209
00:21:19,297 --> 00:21:21,005
- Many of them love you.
- They're good men.

210
00:21:21,006 --> 00:21:22,713
<i>Many don't.</i>

211
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:26,713
You were seen taking the body
of a wildling girl north of the Wall.

212
00:21:26,714 --> 00:21:28,380
<i>Why?</i>

213
00:21:28,381 --> 00:21:29,588
It's where she belonged.

214
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:32,005
Some of the Night's
Watch feel you have

215
00:21:32,006 --> 00:21:33,963
too much affection
for the wildlings.

216
00:21:33,964 --> 00:21:36,380
They were born on the
wrong side of the Wall.

217
00:21:36,381 --> 00:21:38,421
That doesn't make them monsters.

218
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,713
No matter.

219
00:21:39,714 --> 00:21:40,713
I shall take back the North

220
00:21:40,714 --> 00:21:42,630
from the thieves who stole it.

221
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:45,213
Tywin Lannister is dead.
He can't protect them now.

222
00:21:45,214 --> 00:21:48,796
I shall mount Roose Bolton's
head on a spike.

223
00:21:48,797 --> 00:21:51,505
But if I'm to take Winterfell,
I need more men.

224
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:53,505
The men of the Night's Watch
are sworn to play no part--

225
00:21:53,506 --> 00:21:56,505
I'm not talking about
the damn Night's Watch.

226
00:21:56,506 --> 00:21:58,256
I'm talking about the wildlings.

227
00:22:06,256 --> 00:22:10,380
Your Grace,
you want the wildlings

228
00:22:10,381 --> 00:22:12,380
to march in your army?

229
00:22:12,381 --> 00:22:13,671
If they swear to follow me,
I'll pardon them.

230
00:22:13,672 --> 00:22:16,255
We'll take Winterfell.
Once the North is won,

231
00:22:16,256 --> 00:22:17,171
I'll declare them
citizens of the realm.

232
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:19,380
I'll give them land to live on.

233
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:23,546
It's a fair offer.
More than fair.

234
00:22:23,547 --> 00:22:25,505
I'll offer them their lives
and their freedom

235
00:22:25,506 --> 00:22:28,546
if Mance kneels before me
and swears his loyalty.

236
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:29,668
I don't think that's likely.

237
00:22:32,506 --> 00:22:33,921
You admire him, don't you?

238
00:22:33,922 --> 00:22:36,671
- I respect him.
- He likes you.

239
00:22:36,672 --> 00:22:38,588
- Convince him to bend the knee...
- Your Grace.

240
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:39,922
...or he burns.

241
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,296
How much time do I have?

242
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,963
Nightfall.

243
00:22:46,964 --> 00:22:49,255
The sun drops fast
this time of year.

244
00:22:49,256 --> 00:22:50,921
<i>Hurry, Jon Snow.</i>

245
00:22:54,547 --> 00:22:56,130
<i>Shield up.</i>

246
00:22:56,131 --> 00:22:58,963
<i>Attack, my lord!</i>

247
00:22:58,964 --> 00:23:00,338
Attack!

248
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:03,963
Don't cross your feet.

249
00:23:03,964 --> 00:23:05,713
My sons had swords
in their hands

250
00:23:05,714 --> 00:23:07,338
from the time they could walk.
This one...

251
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:09,505
<i>Lord Arryn will never</i>
<i>be a great warrior.</i>

252
00:23:09,506 --> 00:23:11,505
<i>Great warrior?</i>

253
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:14,130
He swings a sword
like a girl with palsy.

254
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:17,046
My lord.

255
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:18,921
<i>Sword up, my lord!</i>

256
00:23:26,422 --> 00:23:28,296
Some boys develop more slowly.

257
00:23:28,297 --> 00:23:30,588
He's still young.

258
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:33,713
He's 13.
Boys go to war at 13.

259
00:23:33,714 --> 00:23:35,755
- He has other gifts.
- Does he?

260
00:23:35,756 --> 00:23:38,546
The gift of a great name.

261
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:42,296
Sometimes that's all one needs.

262
00:23:47,256 --> 00:23:50,005
Good-bye, Lord Royce, and thank you
for all you've done for me.

263
00:23:50,006 --> 00:23:52,421
I have done nothing more
than my duty, my lady.

264
00:23:52,422 --> 00:23:53,755
I have no doubt
that on my return,

265
00:23:53,756 --> 00:23:56,713
Robin's skills will have
improved immeasurably.

266
00:23:56,714 --> 00:23:57,880
He'll be safe here.

267
00:23:57,881 --> 00:24:01,838
<i>As for his skills,</i>

268
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:04,047
I make no promises.

269
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:20,213
Will we head north
at some point?

270
00:24:20,214 --> 00:24:23,505
He said Sansa had a brother
at Castle Black.

271
00:24:23,506 --> 00:24:25,130
We're a few days' ride
from the Kingsroad.

272
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:28,214
- But that will take us--
- Us?

273
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,755
The only reason you're here
is because Jaime Lannister

274
00:24:32,756 --> 00:24:34,422
told me you weren't
safe in the capital.

275
00:24:36,547 --> 00:24:39,505
You're hundreds of miles
from King's Landing.

276
00:24:39,506 --> 00:24:41,505
No one knows what you look like.

277
00:24:41,506 --> 00:24:43,921
No one cares.
You're safe.

278
00:24:43,922 --> 00:24:47,422
- But I'm your squire.
- Do you even know what a squire is?

279
00:24:49,214 --> 00:24:50,005
An attendant to a knight.

280
00:24:50,006 --> 00:24:52,630
I'm not a knight.

281
00:24:52,631 --> 00:24:54,880
That means you're not a squire.

282
00:24:54,881 --> 00:24:55,963
Well, where would I go?

283
00:24:55,964 --> 00:24:58,839
I don't care.
I'm not your mother.

284
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,630
You swore to find
the Stark girls.

285
00:25:09,631 --> 00:25:12,421
I found Arya. She didn't want
my protection.

286
00:25:12,422 --> 00:25:14,631
- <i> Sansa still might.</i>
- Will you shut your mouth?

287
00:25:15,797 --> 00:25:17,631
I didn't ask for your advice.

288
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:22,296
I don't want anyone
following me.

289
00:25:22,297 --> 00:25:24,213
I'm not a leader.

290
00:25:24,214 --> 00:25:27,213
All I ever wanted
was to fight for a lord I believed in.

291
00:25:27,214 --> 00:25:30,131
The good lords are dead
and the rest are monsters.

292
00:25:41,131 --> 00:25:43,380
You told Lord Royce
we were going to the Fingers.

293
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:45,588
I did.

294
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:48,713
- But we're heading west.
- We are.

295
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,672
If he wanted to betray us,
he already would have.

296
00:25:52,214 --> 00:25:55,963
Lord Royce might be as honorable
as he thinks he is,

297
00:25:55,964 --> 00:25:58,338
but he's not alone
in that castle.

298
00:25:58,339 --> 00:25:59,421
Do you trust all those
knights and ladies,

299
00:25:59,422 --> 00:26:02,630
<i>stable boys and serving girls?</i>

300
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:05,588
No, do you trust the carriage driver
or the knights escorting us?

301
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:07,046
No.

302
00:26:07,047 --> 00:26:09,671
But I pay them well

303
00:26:09,672 --> 00:26:11,963
and they've seen what happens
to men who disappoint me.

304
00:26:11,964 --> 00:26:14,338
So where are we going?

305
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,755
To a land where
you trust everyone?

306
00:26:16,756 --> 00:26:19,505
To a land so far from here,

307
00:26:19,506 --> 00:26:21,426
even Cersei Lannister
can't get her hands on you.

308
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,381
It was such a deep,
deep shock to us all.

309
00:26:36,922 --> 00:26:38,088
Your father was a--

310
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:41,046
a force to be reckoned with.

311
00:26:41,047 --> 00:26:42,255
He truly was.

312
00:26:42,256 --> 00:26:45,421
I wouldn't presume to claim

313
00:26:45,422 --> 00:26:47,755
to have known him
as such, but--

314
00:26:47,756 --> 00:26:51,296
<i>but just being in his presence was enough</i>
<i>to make it so clear</i>

315
00:26:51,297 --> 00:26:53,463
just how formidable
a person you were dealing with.

316
00:26:53,464 --> 00:26:56,838
What a-- what a force
to be reckoned with.

317
00:26:59,381 --> 00:27:01,756
Thank you so much
for your kind words.

318
00:27:06,422 --> 00:27:08,963
Deepest condolences, Your Grace.

319
00:27:08,964 --> 00:27:11,005
This tragedy...
I never trusted Varys.

320
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:14,047
I often warned...

321
00:27:16,756 --> 00:27:18,881
Your Grace.

322
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:24,130
Cousin Lancel.
I hardly recognized you.

323
00:27:24,131 --> 00:27:26,421
My deepest sympathies.

324
00:27:26,422 --> 00:27:29,546
I apologize
for my son's appearance.

325
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:30,668
Uncle, it's quite all right.

326
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:36,130
They call themselves sparrows.

327
00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:38,838
Bloody fanatics.

328
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,838
Religion has its place,
of course,

329
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:43,671
but at a certain point...

330
00:27:43,672 --> 00:27:46,630
They never would have come to the capital
when Tywin was alive.

331
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:48,296
I'm sure he'll grow out of it,

332
00:27:48,297 --> 00:27:50,296
whatever it is.

333
00:27:50,297 --> 00:27:52,839
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

334
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,963
Your wounds from the Blackwater
seem to have healed.

335
00:28:13,964 --> 00:28:16,339
It wasn't my wounds
that needed healing.

336
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:21,964
What can I do for you?

337
00:28:22,964 --> 00:28:25,213
You can forgive me.

338
00:28:25,214 --> 00:28:28,046
What could you possibly
have done to warrant my forgiveness?

339
00:28:28,047 --> 00:28:30,755
I led you into the darkness.

340
00:28:30,756 --> 00:28:32,171
I doubt you've ever
led anyone anywhere.

341
00:28:32,172 --> 00:28:34,963
I tempted you into our...

342
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:38,214
unnatural relations.

343
00:28:39,756 --> 00:28:42,214
And, of course,
there was the king...

344
00:28:43,797 --> 00:28:46,631
his boar hunt.

345
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:49,714
His wine.

346
00:28:53,381 --> 00:28:55,255
I don't know what
you're talking about.

347
00:28:55,256 --> 00:28:58,506
I'm a different person now.

348
00:29:00,297 --> 00:29:03,046
I've found peace
in the light of the Seven.

349
00:29:03,047 --> 00:29:04,713
<i>You can, too.</i>

350
00:29:04,714 --> 00:29:06,338
<i>They watch over all of us,</i>

351
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:08,880
ready to dole out mercy

352
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:10,381
or justice.

353
00:29:13,256 --> 00:29:16,131
Their world is at hand.

354
00:29:18,881 --> 00:29:20,546
I will pray for
your father's soul.

355
00:29:23,131 --> 00:29:26,714
The day Tywin Lannister's
soul needs your help...

356
00:29:35,547 --> 00:29:38,005
- It looks like Dorne.
- It doesn't.

357
00:29:38,006 --> 00:29:40,921
It does.

358
00:29:40,922 --> 00:29:45,047
That's the--
that's the Sunspear bit right there.

359
00:29:46,256 --> 00:29:47,963
And that's where
the mountains are.

360
00:29:47,964 --> 00:29:51,296
And over here is--

361
00:29:51,297 --> 00:29:54,088
is Sunsnake?

362
00:29:54,089 --> 00:29:54,713
Stonespear?

363
00:29:54,714 --> 00:29:57,213
Sandstone.

364
00:29:57,214 --> 00:29:58,796
Yes.

365
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,213
Yes, Sandstone.

366
00:30:02,631 --> 00:30:03,963
Just there.

367
00:30:03,964 --> 00:30:05,964
Fine.

368
00:30:08,672 --> 00:30:09,339
It's Dorne.

369
00:30:11,631 --> 00:30:13,838
We should go there.

370
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:16,213
I think we would
have a lovely time,

371
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,588
judging by my experience.

372
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:23,338
That would be wonderful.
Dorne, Highgarden.

373
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:24,881
Anywhere but here.

374
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:35,922
We're late for dinner as it is.

375
00:30:36,714 --> 00:30:38,338
You're very respectful.

376
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:39,214
I'm very hungry.

377
00:30:56,881 --> 00:30:59,671
What's your name?

378
00:30:59,672 --> 00:31:01,338
Olyvar, my lady.

379
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:03,171
I'm afraid my brother

380
00:31:03,172 --> 00:31:06,631
is keeping the king
waiting, Olyvar.

381
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:17,339
My lady.

382
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,588
Perhaps you might
consider being a bit more discreet?

383
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:35,338
Why?

384
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:37,671
They all know about me anyway.

385
00:31:37,672 --> 00:31:40,963
Everybody knows everything
about everyone.

386
00:31:40,964 --> 00:31:44,130
What's the point in trying to
keep a secret in a place like this?

387
00:31:44,131 --> 00:31:47,422
In any event, you shouldn't
keep your intended waiting.

388
00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:50,838
My intended?
Please.

389
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,255
<i>Tywin's dead.</i>

390
00:31:52,256 --> 00:31:54,671
<i>That means no one</i>
<i>can force Cersei to marry me.</i>

391
00:31:54,672 --> 00:31:56,880
- Lucky you.
- Unlucky you.

392
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,338
You think I want that woman
married to my brother?

393
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:02,421
If she doesn't marry me,
she doesn't go to Highgarden.

394
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:05,130
Which means she stays
in King's Landing.

395
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,713
<i>Which means you're trapped here with
Cersei Lannister as your mother by law.</i>

396
00:32:07,714 --> 00:32:09,297
Perhaps.

397
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:13,380
Perhaps?

398
00:32:13,381 --> 00:32:14,214
Perhaps.

399
00:32:27,922 --> 00:32:31,796
Eunuch, the Spider, the
Master of Whisperers.

400
00:32:31,797 --> 00:32:35,089
Imp, Half-man.

401
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,755
There are faster ways
to kill yourself.

402
00:32:39,756 --> 00:32:41,505
Not for a coward.

403
00:32:41,506 --> 00:32:43,546
You are many things, my friend,

404
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:45,297
but not a coward.

405
00:32:49,256 --> 00:32:51,630
You never told me
why you set me free.

406
00:32:51,631 --> 00:32:54,630
Your brother asked me to.

407
00:32:54,631 --> 00:32:55,880
Could have said no.

408
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:59,130
Refuse the Kingslayer?
A dangerous proposition.

409
00:32:59,131 --> 00:33:01,380
Not as dangerous
as releasing me.

410
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:04,088
You risked your life,
your position, everything.

411
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:06,755
Why? You're not family.
You owe me nothing.

412
00:33:06,756 --> 00:33:08,338
I didn't do it for you.

413
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:11,380
I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.

414
00:33:11,381 --> 00:33:14,630
A drunken dwarf will never be the savior
of the Seven Kingdoms.

415
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:16,880
I don't believe in saviors.

416
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:20,256
I believe men of talent
have a part to play in the war to come.

417
00:33:22,047 --> 00:33:23,671
You're going to have
to find another soldier.

418
00:33:23,672 --> 00:33:27,755
I'm done with Westeros
and Westeros is done with me.

419
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:30,963
You have many
admirable qualities,

420
00:33:30,964 --> 00:33:32,338
self-pity is not
one of them.

421
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:34,630
Any fool with a bit of luck

422
00:33:34,631 --> 00:33:38,171
can find himself
born into power.

423
00:33:38,172 --> 00:33:41,838
But earning it for yourself,
that takes work.

424
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:44,380
I'm not well-suited
for work.

425
00:33:44,381 --> 00:33:46,005
I think you are.

426
00:33:46,006 --> 00:33:48,088
You have your father's
instincts for politics.

427
00:33:48,089 --> 00:33:49,671
And you have compassion.

428
00:33:49,672 --> 00:33:52,880
Compassion? Yes.

429
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:55,505
I killed my lover
with my bare hands.

430
00:33:55,506 --> 00:33:59,296
I shot my own father
with a crossbow.

431
00:33:59,297 --> 00:34:01,338
I never said you were perfect.

432
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:05,296
What is it you want exactly?

433
00:34:05,297 --> 00:34:07,296
Peace.

434
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:08,755
Prosperity.

435
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:12,838
A land where the powerful
do not prey on the powerless.

436
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,296
Where the castles
are made of gingerbread

437
00:34:15,297 --> 00:34:17,796
and the moats are filled
with blackberry wine.

438
00:34:17,797 --> 00:34:20,088
The powerful have always
preyed on the powerless.

439
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:22,505
That's how they became powerful
in the first place.

440
00:34:22,506 --> 00:34:24,421
Perhaps.

441
00:34:24,422 --> 00:34:28,005
And perhaps we've grown
so used to horror,

442
00:34:28,006 --> 00:34:29,631
we assume there's no other way.

443
00:34:30,714 --> 00:34:33,421
<i>If you sat on the Iron Throne,</i>

444
00:34:33,422 --> 00:34:35,588
<i>would you spread misery</i>
<i>throughout the land?</i>

445
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:38,005
I will never sit
on the Iron Throne.

446
00:34:38,006 --> 00:34:40,421
<i>No, you won't.</i>

447
00:34:40,422 --> 00:34:42,796
<i>But you could help another</i>
<i>climb those steps</i>

448
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:45,296
and take that seat.

449
00:34:45,297 --> 00:34:48,338
The Seven Kingdoms
need someone stronger than Tommen,

450
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:50,630
but gentler than Stannis.

451
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:53,546
A monarch who can intimidate the
high lords and inspire the people.

452
00:34:53,547 --> 00:34:57,630
A ruler loved by millions
with a powerful army

453
00:34:57,631 --> 00:34:59,505
and the right family name.

454
00:34:59,506 --> 00:35:01,796
Good luck finding him.

455
00:35:01,797 --> 00:35:04,839
Who said anything about "him"?

456
00:35:08,797 --> 00:35:11,171
You have a choice, my friend.

457
00:35:11,172 --> 00:35:13,171
You can stay here
at Illyrio's palace

458
00:35:13,172 --> 00:35:15,755
and drink yourself to death,

459
00:35:15,756 --> 00:35:17,088
or you can ride with me
to Meereen,

460
00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:19,546
meet Daenerys Targaryen,

461
00:35:19,547 --> 00:35:21,964
and decide if the world
is worth fighting for.

462
00:35:23,714 --> 00:35:28,047
Can I drink myself to death
on the road to Meereen?

463
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:41,588
When did the Unsullied
start patrolling the streets of Meereen?

464
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:44,422
Looks like your friends haven't
been behaving themselves.

465
00:35:46,756 --> 00:35:50,588
Our mission to Yunkai
was a resounding success.

466
00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:53,171
The Wise Masters of Yunkai
have agreed to cede power

467
00:35:53,172 --> 00:35:55,046
to a council of elders
made up of both

468
00:35:55,047 --> 00:35:57,463
the freed men and
the former slaveholders.

469
00:35:57,464 --> 00:35:59,588
All matters of consequence will be
brought to you for review.

470
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:01,338
Good.

471
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:03,880
They did ask
for some concessions.

472
00:36:03,881 --> 00:36:05,630
Concessions?

473
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:08,713
Politics is the art
of compromise, Your Grace.

474
00:36:08,714 --> 00:36:11,630
I'm not a politician.
I'm a queen.

475
00:36:11,631 --> 00:36:14,880
<i>Forgive me.</i>
<i>You're right, of course.</i>

476
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:19,296
Still, it's easier to rule happy
subjects than angry ones.

477
00:36:19,297 --> 00:36:21,296
I don't expect
the Wise Masters to be happy.

478
00:36:21,297 --> 00:36:23,671
Slavery made them rich.
I ended slavery.

479
00:36:23,672 --> 00:36:26,755
They do not ask
for the return of slavery.

480
00:36:26,756 --> 00:36:29,339
They ask for the reopening
of the fighting pits.

481
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:33,005
The fighting pits?

482
00:36:33,006 --> 00:36:34,505
Where slaves fought
slaves to the death?

483
00:36:34,506 --> 00:36:37,380
In the new world
that you've brought to us,

484
00:36:37,381 --> 00:36:39,714
free men would fight free men.

485
00:36:41,214 --> 00:36:42,630
<i>The pit fighters you liberated</i>

486
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:44,713
<i>plead for this opportunity.</i>

487
00:36:44,714 --> 00:36:47,046
Bring some here
and ask them yourself.

488
00:36:47,047 --> 00:36:48,255
No fighting pits.

489
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,588
Opening them would show
the people of Yunkai

490
00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:52,546
and Meereen that you
respect their traditions.

491
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:54,963
I do not respect the tradition of
human cockfighting.

492
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:58,214
- If you-- - How many times must I say no
before you understand?

493
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:04,005
Whatever he wants from me,
he's not going to get it.

494
00:37:04,006 --> 00:37:06,546
If he really believes
I'm going to reopen the fighting pits...

495
00:37:06,547 --> 00:37:08,713
You should reopen
the fighting pits.

496
00:37:08,714 --> 00:37:11,588
What?

497
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:13,214
My mother was a whore.
I told you that.

498
00:37:15,297 --> 00:37:17,963
She liked to drink pear brandy.

499
00:37:17,964 --> 00:37:22,046
The older she got, the less
she made selling her body,

500
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:24,421
the more she wanted to drink.

501
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:27,630
So one day when I was 12,
she sold me to a slaver

502
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:30,255
she fucked the night before.

503
00:37:30,256 --> 00:37:32,546
I'm sorry.

504
00:37:32,547 --> 00:37:35,296
Why?
I was a bad child.

505
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:38,088
I wasn't big, but I was quick.

506
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,380
And I loved to fight.

507
00:37:40,381 --> 00:37:42,380
So they sold me
to a man in Tolos

508
00:37:42,381 --> 00:37:44,546
who trained fighters
for the pits.

509
00:37:44,547 --> 00:37:47,171
I had my first match
when I was 16.

510
00:37:47,172 --> 00:37:49,338
You were sold into slavery,

511
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:51,796
forced to fight to the death
for the amusement of the masters,

512
00:37:51,797 --> 00:37:53,317
and you're defending
the fighting pits?

513
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:57,796
I'm only here
because of those pits.

514
00:37:57,797 --> 00:38:00,421
I learned to fight
like a Dothraki screamer,

515
00:38:00,422 --> 00:38:01,838
a Norvoshi priest,
a Westerosi knight.

516
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,463
Soon I was famous.

517
00:38:04,464 --> 00:38:06,713
10,000 men and women
screamed my name

518
00:38:06,714 --> 00:38:07,796
when I stepped into the pit.

519
00:38:07,797 --> 00:38:09,296
I made so much money
for my master,

520
00:38:09,297 --> 00:38:12,088
he set me free when he died.

521
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,880
I joined the Second Sons.

522
00:38:13,881 --> 00:38:16,797
And then I met you.

523
00:38:22,297 --> 00:38:23,630
You're the queen.

524
00:38:23,631 --> 00:38:27,171
Everyone's too afraid
of you to speak truth.

525
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:29,755
Everyone but me.

526
00:38:29,756 --> 00:38:33,963
You've made thousands
of enemies all across the world.

527
00:38:33,964 --> 00:38:36,755
As soon as they see weakness,

528
00:38:36,756 --> 00:38:39,005
they'll attack.

529
00:38:39,006 --> 00:38:42,546
Show your strength here, now.

530
00:38:42,547 --> 00:38:44,708
That's why I have the Unsullied
patrolling the streets.

531
00:38:46,922 --> 00:38:50,463
Anyone with a chest
full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied.

532
00:38:50,464 --> 00:38:54,213
You're not
the Mother of Unsullied.

533
00:38:54,214 --> 00:38:55,374
You're the Mother of Dragons.

534
00:39:03,047 --> 00:39:06,922
I don't want another child's bones
dropped at my feet.

535
00:39:07,922 --> 00:39:10,796
No one's seen Drogon in weeks.

536
00:39:10,797 --> 00:39:13,256
For all I know, he's flown halfway
across the world.

537
00:39:18,214 --> 00:39:20,339
I can't control them anymore.

538
00:39:21,756 --> 00:39:25,296
A dragon queen with no dragons

539
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:26,422
is not a queen.

540
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:35,131
Viserion?

541
00:40:37,131 --> 00:40:39,006
Rhaegal?

542
00:40:51,006 --> 00:40:52,546
Easy. Easy.

543
00:40:52,547 --> 00:40:54,713
Easy.

544
00:41:34,131 --> 00:41:36,338
So here we are.

545
00:41:36,339 --> 00:41:37,422
Here we are.

546
00:41:40,214 --> 00:41:44,005
When we first met,
you were my prisoner.

547
00:41:44,006 --> 00:41:46,214
And now, for our last meeting...

548
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:52,005
This doesn't have to be
our last meeting.

549
00:41:52,006 --> 00:41:54,422
No, but it will be.

550
00:41:56,964 --> 00:41:59,296
You know what Stannis wants?

551
00:41:59,297 --> 00:42:01,838
He wants me to bend the knee.

552
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:04,213
And he wants the free folk
to fight for him.

553
00:42:04,214 --> 00:42:07,421
I'll give him this much,

554
00:42:07,422 --> 00:42:08,755
he's bold.

555
00:42:08,756 --> 00:42:10,296
Shouldn't a king be bold?

556
00:42:10,297 --> 00:42:12,380
<i>Oh, aye.</i>

557
00:42:12,381 --> 00:42:15,505
I respect him.

558
00:42:15,506 --> 00:42:17,046
If he gets what he wants,

559
00:42:17,047 --> 00:42:18,755
I expect he'll be a better ruler
than the fools

560
00:42:18,756 --> 00:42:22,671
sitting on the Iron Throne
the last hundred years.

561
00:42:22,672 --> 00:42:25,131
But I'll never serve him.

562
00:42:26,381 --> 00:42:28,171
You told me you weren't
here to conquer.

563
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:29,505
You told me your people
have bled enough.

564
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:31,130
That's right.

565
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:34,421
I don't want them bleeding for
Stannis Baratheon either.

566
00:42:34,422 --> 00:42:37,880
You spent your life convincing
90 clans to come together

567
00:42:37,881 --> 00:42:38,963
for the first time in history.

568
00:42:38,964 --> 00:42:42,130
Thenns and Hornfoots,

569
00:42:42,131 --> 00:42:45,213
the ice-river clans,
even the giants.

570
00:42:45,214 --> 00:42:48,213
A life's work uniting them.
You didn't do it for power.

571
00:42:48,214 --> 00:42:51,588
You didn't do it for glory.

572
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:53,755
You brought them
together to save them

573
00:42:53,756 --> 00:42:55,296
<i>because none of them</i>
<i>will survive the winter,</i>

574
00:42:55,297 --> 00:42:57,171
<i>not if they're north</i>
<i>of the Wall.</i>

575
00:42:57,172 --> 00:42:59,171
Isn't their survival
more important than your pride?

576
00:42:59,172 --> 00:43:01,006
Pride?

577
00:43:03,172 --> 00:43:05,714
Fuck my pride.

578
00:43:07,006 --> 00:43:09,297
This isn't about that.

579
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,422
Then bend the knee
and save your people.

580
00:43:17,297 --> 00:43:20,546
They followed me
because they respected me.

581
00:43:20,547 --> 00:43:22,505
Because they believed in me.

582
00:43:22,506 --> 00:43:24,880
The moment I kneel
for a southern king, that's all gone.

583
00:43:24,881 --> 00:43:28,171
And how many tens of thousands
are out there right now?

584
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:31,421
How many women?
How many children?

585
00:43:31,422 --> 00:43:34,463
And you won't go out and rescue
them because why?

586
00:43:34,464 --> 00:43:36,671
You're afraid of looking afraid.

587
00:43:36,672 --> 00:43:39,506
Oh, I am afraid.

588
00:43:40,131 --> 00:43:42,297
No shame in that.

589
00:43:51,672 --> 00:43:55,588
How will they do it?
Beheading?

590
00:43:55,589 --> 00:43:57,464
Hanging?

591
00:44:00,172 --> 00:44:02,756
They'll burn you alive.

592
00:44:07,422 --> 00:44:09,214
Bad way to go.

593
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:15,171
I'll be honest with you.

594
00:44:15,172 --> 00:44:17,171
I don't want to die.

595
00:44:17,172 --> 00:44:19,338
And burnt to death,

596
00:44:19,339 --> 00:44:21,296
I don't want people
to remember me like that,

597
00:44:21,297 --> 00:44:23,171
scorched and screaming.

598
00:44:23,172 --> 00:44:25,963
But it's better than betraying

599
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:27,671
everything I believe.

600
00:44:27,672 --> 00:44:30,130
And what happens to your people?

601
00:44:30,131 --> 00:44:33,880
You preserve your dignity
and die standing

602
00:44:33,881 --> 00:44:36,296
and they'll sing
songs about you.

603
00:44:36,297 --> 00:44:37,755
You'd rather burn than kneel.

604
00:44:37,756 --> 00:44:39,422
The great hero.

605
00:44:42,256 --> 00:44:45,130
Until winter comes and
the white walkers come for us all

606
00:44:45,131 --> 00:44:47,797
and there's no one left to sing.

607
00:44:50,214 --> 00:44:51,796
You're a good lad.

608
00:44:51,797 --> 00:44:54,963
Truly you are.

609
00:44:54,964 --> 00:45:00,005
But if you can't understand why I won't
enlist my people

610
00:45:00,006 --> 00:45:02,755
in a foreigner's war,

611
00:45:02,756 --> 00:45:04,756
there's no point explaining.

612
00:45:21,339 --> 00:45:23,338
I think you're making
a terrible mistake.

613
00:45:25,172 --> 00:45:27,713
The freedom to make
my own mistakes

614
00:45:27,714 --> 00:45:29,381
was all I ever wanted.

615
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:42,713
Mance Rayder, you've been called
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

616
00:46:42,714 --> 00:46:45,463
Westeros only has one king.

617
00:46:45,464 --> 00:46:47,797
Bend the knee,
I promise you mercy.

618
00:47:01,339 --> 00:47:03,464
Kneel and live.

619
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:14,631
This was my home for many years.

620
00:47:16,381 --> 00:47:17,963
I wish you good fortune

621
00:47:17,964 --> 00:47:20,631
in the wars to come.

622
00:48:02,006 --> 00:48:05,046
We all must choose.

623
00:48:05,047 --> 00:48:09,630
Man or woman, young or old,

624
00:48:09,631 --> 00:48:13,046
lord or peasant,
our choices are the same.

625
00:48:13,047 --> 00:48:16,546
We choose light
or we choose darkness.

626
00:48:16,547 --> 00:48:19,588
<i>We choose good</i>
<i>or we choose evil.</i>

627
00:48:19,589 --> 00:48:24,297
We choose the true god
or the false.

628
00:48:35,256 --> 00:48:37,171
Free folk,

629
00:48:37,172 --> 00:48:39,588
<i>there is only one true king</i>

630
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:42,713
<i>and his name is Stannis.</i>

631
00:48:42,714 --> 00:48:45,171
Here stands your king of lies.

632
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:48,297
Behold the fate of those
who choose the darkness.

633
