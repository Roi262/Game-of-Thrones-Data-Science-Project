00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:55,192
( insects chirping )

4
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,483
( gasps, grunts )

5
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:02,192
( gasping )

00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,817
( grunts )

00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:13,191
( gasping )

8
00:02:13,192 --> 00:02:16,525
( coughing, panting )

9
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:22,400
You could've killed me.

10
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,858
The fuck were you doing
back there?

11
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:35,150
Ending the war.

12
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:37,358
Killing her.

13
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:39,775
You saw the dragon
between you and her?

14
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:45,775
- And?
- ( grunts )

15
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:54,358
Listen to me, cunt.

16
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:55,900
Till I get
what I'm owed,

17
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:57,734
a dragon doesn't
get to kill you,

18
00:02:57,735 --> 00:02:59,609
you don't
get to kill you,

19
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,068
only I get
to kill you.

20
00:03:04,193 --> 00:03:07,067
That was only
one of them.

21
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:09,901
She has two more.

22
00:03:09,902 --> 00:03:12,984
If she decides to use them,
to really use them...

23
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,609
- You're fucked.
- Don't you mean we're fucked?

24
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,609
No, I do not.

25
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,775
Dragons are where
our partnership ends.

26
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:22,400
I'm not gonna be around
when those things

27
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:24,152
start spitting fire
on King's Landing.

28
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:27,651
I have to tell
Cersei.

29
00:03:30,484 --> 00:03:32,443
May as well jump
back in that river.

30
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:11,734
( men shouting
in distance )

31
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:13,652
( shouting continues )

32
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:27,861
( Drogon screeches )

33
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:42,484
( roaring )

34
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,776
I know what Cersei
has told you.

35
00:04:49,777 --> 00:04:54,526
That I've come
to destroy your cities,

36
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:55,776
burn down your homes,

37
00:04:55,777 --> 00:04:57,527
murder you,
and orphan your children.

38
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,152
That's Cersei Lannister,
not me.

39
00:05:04,153 --> 00:05:06,359
I'm not here
to murder,

40
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,110
and all I want
to destroy

41
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:11,193
is the wheel that has
rolled over rich and poor

42
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:15,402
to the benefit of no one but the
Cersei Lannisters of the world.

43
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:18,860
I offer you a choice...

44
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:21,193
bend the knee
and join me.

45
00:05:21,194 --> 00:05:25,359
Together, we will leave the world
a better place than we found it.

46
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,359
Or refuse...

47
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,861
and die.

48
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:42,736
( snarls )

49
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:46,194
( roaring )

50
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:00,403
Step forward,
my lord.

51
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,527
You will not kneel?

52
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:12,904
I already have
a queen.

53
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:15,610
Tyrion:
My sister.

54
00:06:15,611 --> 00:06:16,819
She wasn't your queen

55
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,860
until recently,
though, was she?

56
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:21,194
When she murdered
your rightful queen

57
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:23,819
and destroyed House Tyrell
for all time.

58
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,112
So it appears your allegiances
are somewhat flexible.

59
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:31,153
There are
no easy choices in war.

60
00:06:31,154 --> 00:06:33,527
Say what you will
about your sister,

61
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:36,028
she was born
in Westeros.

62
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,277
She's lived here
all her life.

63
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:43,111
You, on the other hand,

64
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:45,861
murdered your own father

65
00:06:45,862 --> 00:06:48,986
and chose to support
a foreign invader.

66
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:51,820
One with no ties
to this land...

67
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:55,820
with an army of savages
at her back.

68
00:06:57,653 --> 00:06:59,486
You will not trade
your honor for your life.

69
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:02,944
I respect that.

70
00:07:02,945 --> 00:07:05,986
Perhaps he could take
the Black, Your Grace.

71
00:07:05,987 --> 00:07:08,402
Whatever else he is,
he is a true soldier.

72
00:07:08,403 --> 00:07:10,652
He'd be invaluable
at the Wall.

73
00:07:10,653 --> 00:07:12,987
You cannot send me
to the Wall.

74
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:15,987
You are not my queen.

75
00:07:29,445 --> 00:07:30,778
You will have
to kill me, too.

76
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:32,653
Step back
and shut your mouth.

77
00:07:34,196 --> 00:07:35,611
Who are you?

78
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:36,863
A stupid boy.

79
00:07:37,988 --> 00:07:40,195
I am Dickon Tarly,

80
00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:41,611
son of Randyll Tarly.

81
00:07:41,612 --> 00:07:43,820
You are the future
of your house.

82
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:47,195
This war has already wiped one
great house from the world.

83
00:07:47,196 --> 00:07:49,070
Don't let it happen again.
Bend the knee.

84
00:07:56,738 --> 00:07:58,196
I will not.

85
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:06,236
Your Grace, nothing scrubs
bold notions from a man's head

86
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:07,820
like a few weeks
in a dark cell.

87
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,486
I meant what I said.

88
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:12,028
I'm not here
to put men in chains.

89
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:14,361
If that becomes an option,
many will take it.

90
00:08:14,362 --> 00:08:15,738
I gave them a choice.

91
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:18,569
They made it.

92
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,736
Your Grace, if you start
beheading entire families...

93
00:08:21,737 --> 00:08:23,905
I'm not beheading
anyone.

94
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:29,278
( roaring )

95
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,738
Your Grace.

96
00:08:55,071 --> 00:08:58,612
Daenerys: Lord Randyll Tarly,
Dickon Tarly,

97
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:01,279
I, Daenerys of House
Targaryen, First of My Name,

98
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,404
Breaker of Chains,
and Mother of Dragons,

99
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:06,237
sentence you to die.

100
00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:10,989
Dracarys.

101
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,280
( both screaming )

102
00:09:27,322 --> 00:09:30,405
- ( man shouts )
- ( Drogon roaring )

103
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:57,114
( door closes )

104
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:00,530
My... my lord...

105
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:12,031
How many men
did we lose?

106
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,655
We haven't done
a full accounting.

107
00:10:18,363 --> 00:10:21,821
It's not only armies
that win wars.

108
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,321
We have the Tyrell gold,
we have the Iron Bank behind us.

109
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:25,989
We can buy
mercenaries.

110
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:29,779
Not the same as our men,
but they'll fight

111
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,988
if they're well paid,
which they will be.

112
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:35,446
I just saw
the Dothraki fight.

113
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:37,071
They'll beat
any mercenary army.

114
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:39,155
They'll beat any army
I've ever seen.

115
00:10:39,156 --> 00:10:42,030
Killing our men wasn't war
for them, it was sport.

116
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:44,238
Her dragon burnt
a thousand wagons.

117
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:46,487
Qyburn's scorpion fired
bolts bigger than you.

118
00:10:46,488 --> 00:10:49,031
They couldn't stop it.
And she has three of them.

119
00:10:51,073 --> 00:10:52,988
This isn't a war
we can win.

120
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:54,364
So, what do we do?

121
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,032
Sue for peace?

122
00:10:58,363 --> 00:10:59,946
I sit on
her father's throne,

123
00:10:59,947 --> 00:11:02,613
the father you betrayed
and murdered.

124
00:11:02,614 --> 00:11:05,446
And in her mind,
she's winning.

125
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:07,531
What sort of offer
do you think she'd make?

126
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,405
Maybe we can count on Tyrion
to intercede on our behalf

127
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,780
by way of apology for
murdering our father and son.

128
00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:19,030
He didn't.

129
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:21,031
You saw the crossbow,
you saw his body.

130
00:11:21,032 --> 00:11:22,906
I'm not talking
about Father.

131
00:11:22,907 --> 00:11:26,447
Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.
He had nothing to do with it.

132
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:29,740
- After all this time, it still amazes me that you...
- It was Olenna.

133
00:11:32,114 --> 00:11:34,448
She confessed
before she died.

134
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,989
And this was
before or after

135
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,072
she drank the poison
you so kindly provided her?

136
00:11:42,073 --> 00:11:43,697
After.

137
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:45,197
And you believed her?

138
00:11:45,198 --> 00:11:47,947
If you were Olenna,
would you rather have seen

139
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:50,615
your granddaughter married
to Joffrey or Tommen?

140
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,363
Which one would Margaery have
been better able to control?

141
00:11:55,364 --> 00:11:56,906
Which one would have
made Olenna

142
00:11:56,907 --> 00:11:59,614
the true ruler
of the Seven Kingdoms?

143
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,490
She was telling
the truth.

144
00:12:08,865 --> 00:12:11,074
I shouldn't have
listened to you.

145
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,656
She should have
died screaming.

146
00:12:14,657 --> 00:12:15,947
She's dead,
like her son,

147
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:18,032
her grandchildren,
her whole house.

148
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:21,614
And if we don't find a way out
of this war, we'll follow them.

149
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,157
So we fight and die
or we submit and die.

150
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:26,322
I know my choice.

151
00:12:26,323 --> 00:12:28,823
A soldier
should know his.

152
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,823
( Drogon screeching )

153
00:12:56,158 --> 00:12:57,782
( roaring )

154
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:30,991
( snarling )

155
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:35,199
( snarling stops )

156
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,407
( exhales )

157
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:35,948
( screeching )

158
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:38,116
They're beautiful,
aren't they?

159
00:14:38,117 --> 00:14:40,909
It wasn't the word
I was thinking of, but...

160
00:14:42,158 --> 00:14:44,907
but, yes, they are.

161
00:14:44,908 --> 00:14:46,407
Gorgeous beasts.

162
00:14:46,408 --> 00:14:48,323
They're not
beasts to me.

163
00:14:48,324 --> 00:14:50,158
No matter
how big they get

164
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,324
or how terrifying
to everyone else,

165
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,950
they're my children.

166
00:14:59,617 --> 00:15:00,949
You weren't gone long.

167
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,116
No.

168
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:05,116
And?

169
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:07,825
And I have fewer enemies
today than I did yesterday.

170
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:12,574
You're not sure
how you feel about that.

171
00:15:12,575 --> 00:15:14,283
No, I'm not.

172
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,657
How many men
did your army kill

173
00:15:17,658 --> 00:15:19,658
taking Winterfell back
from the Boltons?

174
00:15:20,825 --> 00:15:22,199
Thousands.

175
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,324
We both want
to help people.

176
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:28,034
We can only help them
from a position of strength.

177
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:30,117
Sometimes
strength is terrible.

178
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:35,991
When you first
came here,

179
00:15:35,992 --> 00:15:39,741
Ser Davos said you took a knife
in the heart for your people.

180
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:41,367
Ser Davos
gets carried away.

181
00:15:43,117 --> 00:15:44,824
So, it was
a figure of speech?

182
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:47,160
( footsteps approaching )

183
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:53,159
( speaking Dothraki )

184
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:06,366
Your Grace.

185
00:16:12,408 --> 00:16:15,782
Jon Snow, this is
Ser Jorah Mormont,

186
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:18,034
an old friend.

187
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:19,533
I served
with your father.

188
00:16:19,534 --> 00:16:21,700
He was a great man.

189
00:16:23,242 --> 00:16:24,909
You look strong.

190
00:16:26,743 --> 00:16:28,075
You found a cure?

191
00:16:28,076 --> 00:16:30,034
I wouldn't be here
if I hadn't.

192
00:16:30,035 --> 00:16:34,533
I return to your
service, my queen,

193
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:36,325
if you'll have me.

194
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:38,701
It would be my honor.

195
00:16:55,701 --> 00:16:59,242
( ravens cawing )

196
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,326
( ravens cawing )

197
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:14,951
( panting )

198
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,618
Ravens.

199
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:21,451
We need to send ravens.

200
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:26,659
I put very little stock
in it myself.

201
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,118
Prophecies of doom
are never in short supply,

202
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:31,326
especially
when winter comes.

203
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:33,659
I remember Wolkan.

204
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,035
A little timid,
but a sharp mind.

205
00:18:36,036 --> 00:18:39,534
Sandhu: Eh, the North has dulled
many good maesters' wits.

206
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,743
Hard to say whether
it's the cold, the drink,

207
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:43,534
- or the company.
- ( all chuckling )

208
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:45,701
Sandhu: A crippled boy
claims to have seen

209
00:18:45,702 --> 00:18:47,827
dead men on the march
beyond the Wall,

210
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:50,994
thanks to the magical help
of a raven with three eyes?

211
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:52,659
Ebrose:
Yes, it is a bit much.

212
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,368
- Still, we ought to write back...
- Sam: Brandon Stark.

213
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:02,036
- The crippled boy.
- Do you know him?

214
00:19:03,202 --> 00:19:05,367
I led him through
the Wall years ago.

215
00:19:05,368 --> 00:19:08,534
I saw him go
beyond the Wall.

216
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:10,118
And?

217
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:13,035
Somehow,
a crippled boy

218
00:19:13,036 --> 00:19:15,118
survived for years beyond the
Wall when no one else could.

219
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,869
Not the Night's Watch,
not the wildlings, no one.

220
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:22,576
Perhaps we ought to listen
to what he has to say.

221
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:25,701
Perhaps you need more scribing
work to discipline your mind.

222
00:19:25,702 --> 00:19:29,119
I sense a more detailed
proposal is forthcoming?

223
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:37,120
( clears throat )

224
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:43,744
Everyone in Westeros
trusts and respects you.

225
00:19:43,745 --> 00:19:47,911
If you tell people the threat
is real, they'll believe it.

226
00:19:47,912 --> 00:19:50,285
If you advise all the lords
to send their men north

227
00:19:50,286 --> 00:19:52,243
to hold the Wall,
they'll do it.

228
00:19:52,244 --> 00:19:55,744
And if you tell every
maester in the Citadel

229
00:19:55,745 --> 00:19:58,077
to search every word
of every faded scroll

230
00:19:58,078 --> 00:19:59,869
about the Long Night,

231
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,701
they may find something
that lets us defeat

232
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,620
the Army of the Dead
for good.

233
00:20:08,703 --> 00:20:09,912
It could be done.

234
00:20:11,328 --> 00:20:14,119
And this news
could be authentic.

235
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,786
It's possible.

236
00:20:18,286 --> 00:20:20,619
It's also possible
that this message

237
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,911
is part of a ploy
by the Dragon Queen

238
00:20:22,912 --> 00:20:25,869
to lure southern armies away from the
lands they are currently defending

239
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,912
to open those lands
to easy conquest.

240
00:20:27,913 --> 00:20:29,619
Sandhu: That does
seem far more likely

241
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,577
than magic birds
talking to cripples.

242
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:34,120
Archmaester, please.

243
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:35,286
It's real.

244
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,286
I've seen it.

245
00:20:41,121 --> 00:20:42,619
We will write
to Maester Wolkan

246
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,994
at Winterfell
for clarification.

247
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,870
I promise you we will get to the
truth of it one way or another.

248
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,578
- Archmaester, please...
- That will be all, Tarly.

249
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:53,077
Maester: It brings to mind the
work of Jenny of Oldstones,

250
00:20:53,078 --> 00:20:55,702
the charlatan who claimed descent
from the children of the forest.

251
00:20:55,703 --> 00:20:58,493
- ( all chuckling )
- Sandhu: Don't forget the prophet Lodos,

252
00:20:58,494 --> 00:21:02,161
who promised that the Drowned God would
rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.

253
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:04,454
- ( all laugh )
- Ah, Lodos.

254
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:12,285
Is he the one whose father and
brother were just burnt alive?

255
00:21:12,286 --> 00:21:14,244
I'm afraid so.

256
00:21:14,245 --> 00:21:15,493
Horrible business.

257
00:21:15,494 --> 00:21:18,119
I haven't had the heart
to tell him yet.

258
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,162
He's a good lad.

259
00:21:20,163 --> 00:21:21,911
Right.

260
00:21:21,912 --> 00:21:24,827
The ravenry was falling apart
the last time I checked.

261
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:26,579
( slurping )

262
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,661
All rulers demand
that people bend the knee.

263
00:21:32,662 --> 00:21:33,871
That's why
they're rulers.

264
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:38,995
She gave Tarly
a choice,

265
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:41,828
a man who had taken up
arms against her.

266
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:43,578
What else
could she do?

267
00:21:43,579 --> 00:21:46,703
Not burn him alive
alongside his son?

268
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:49,037
I am her Hand, not her head.

269
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:51,286
I can't make
her decisions for her.

270
00:21:51,287 --> 00:21:54,578
That's what I used to tell
myself about her father.

271
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:58,953
I found the traitors, but I wasn't
the one burning them alive.

272
00:21:58,954 --> 00:22:01,704
I was only a purveyor
of information.

273
00:22:06,871 --> 00:22:10,913
It's what I told myself when I
watched them beg for mercy...

274
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:13,494
I'm not the one
doing it.

275
00:22:13,495 --> 00:22:15,953
When the pitch of their
screams rose higher...

276
00:22:15,954 --> 00:22:17,996
I'm not the one
doing it.

277
00:22:17,997 --> 00:22:19,578
When their hair
caught fire

278
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:22,453
and the smell of their burning
flesh filled the throne room...

279
00:22:22,454 --> 00:22:24,080
I'm not the one
doing it.

280
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:30,246
( sighs )

281
00:22:32,746 --> 00:22:34,953
Daenerys is not
her father.

282
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,370
And she never will be

283
00:22:37,371 --> 00:22:39,412
with the right counsel.

284
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:45,079
You need to find a way
to make her listen.

285
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:50,913
- Who's that for?
- Jon Snow.

286
00:22:50,914 --> 00:22:52,453
Did you read it?

287
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,495
It's a sealed scroll
for the King in the North.

288
00:23:01,621 --> 00:23:03,080
What's it say?

289
00:23:04,164 --> 00:23:05,747
Nothing good.

290
00:23:12,246 --> 00:23:15,621
I thought
Arya was dead.

291
00:23:15,622 --> 00:23:18,704
I thought Bran
was dead.

292
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:20,122
I'm happy for you.

293
00:23:22,496 --> 00:23:23,913
You don't look happy.

294
00:23:23,914 --> 00:23:26,287
Bran saw the Night King
and his army

295
00:23:26,288 --> 00:23:28,288
marching towards
Eastwatch.

296
00:23:29,872 --> 00:23:31,871
If they make it
past the Wall...

297
00:23:31,872 --> 00:23:34,579
The Wall has kept them out for
thousands of years, presumably.

298
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,245
I need to go home.

299
00:23:36,246 --> 00:23:37,955
You said you don't
have enough men.

300
00:23:37,956 --> 00:23:40,537
We'll fight
with the men we have.

301
00:23:40,538 --> 00:23:42,163
Unless you'll join us.

302
00:23:42,164 --> 00:23:44,329
And give the country
to Cersei?

303
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:48,163
As soon as I march away,
she marches in.

304
00:23:48,164 --> 00:23:50,495
Perhaps not.

305
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:53,913
Cersei thinks the Army of the
Dead is nothing but a story

306
00:23:53,914 --> 00:23:57,163
made up by wet nurses
to frighten children.

307
00:23:57,164 --> 00:23:58,913
What if we
prove her wrong?

308
00:23:58,914 --> 00:24:02,330
I don't think she'll come see
the dead at my invitation.

309
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:05,663
So bring
the dead to her.

310
00:24:07,123 --> 00:24:08,996
I thought that was what
we were trying to avoid.

311
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:11,371
We don't have to
bring the whole army.

312
00:24:11,372 --> 00:24:13,413
Only one soldier.

313
00:24:13,414 --> 00:24:15,330
Is that possible?

314
00:24:19,164 --> 00:24:20,872
The first wight
I ever saw

315
00:24:20,873 --> 00:24:23,705
was brought into Castle
Black from beyond the Wall.

316
00:24:23,706 --> 00:24:26,038
Bring one of these things
down to King's Landing

317
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,329
and show her the truth.

318
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,371
Anything you bring back
will be useless

319
00:24:30,372 --> 00:24:32,204
unless Cersei
grants us an audience

320
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:34,746
and is somehow convinced
not to murder us

321
00:24:34,747 --> 00:24:36,997
the moment we set foot
in the capital.

322
00:24:36,998 --> 00:24:40,580
The only person
she listens to is Jaime.

323
00:24:40,581 --> 00:24:42,413
He might listen to me.

324
00:24:46,414 --> 00:24:48,246
And how would you get
into King's Landing?

325
00:24:54,414 --> 00:24:56,246
I can smuggle you in,

326
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:58,872
but if the gold cloaks
were to recognize you,

327
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:02,080
I'm warning you,
I'm not a fighter.

328
00:25:02,081 --> 00:25:03,496
Well, it will all
be for nothing

329
00:25:03,497 --> 00:25:05,288
if we don't have
one of these dead men.

330
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:06,663
Fair point.

331
00:25:06,664 --> 00:25:07,956
How do you propose
to find one?

332
00:25:11,371 --> 00:25:14,581
With the queen's permission,
I'll go north and take one.

333
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:19,622
You asked me to find a
cure so I could serve you.

334
00:25:19,623 --> 00:25:21,248
Allow me
to serve you.

335
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:26,747
The Free Folk
will help us.

336
00:25:26,748 --> 00:25:29,496
They know the real north
better than anyone.

337
00:25:29,497 --> 00:25:31,040
They won't follow
Ser Jorah.

338
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:32,247
They won't have to.

339
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:41,705
You can't lead a raid
beyond the Wall.

340
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,331
You're not in the Night's Watch
anymore, you're King in the North.

341
00:25:44,332 --> 00:25:46,914
I'm the only one here
who's fought them.

342
00:25:46,915 --> 00:25:49,289
I'm the only one here
who knows them.

343
00:25:50,665 --> 00:25:52,664
I haven't given you
permission to leave.

344
00:25:55,497 --> 00:25:58,872
With respect, Your Grace,
I don't need your permission.

345
00:25:58,873 --> 00:26:00,082
I am a king.

346
00:26:01,706 --> 00:26:03,123
And I came here

347
00:26:03,124 --> 00:26:04,955
knowing that you could
have your men behead me

348
00:26:04,956 --> 00:26:08,164
or your dragons
burn me alive.

349
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:12,580
I put my trust
in you, a stranger,

350
00:26:12,581 --> 00:26:15,580
because I knew it was the
best chance for my people,

351
00:26:15,581 --> 00:26:17,749
for all our people.

352
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:23,624
Now I'm asking you
to trust in a stranger...

353
00:26:25,331 --> 00:26:27,832
because it's
our best chance.

354
00:26:43,082 --> 00:26:45,831
( all chattering )

355
00:26:45,832 --> 00:26:50,166
Glover: The King in the North
should stay in the North.

356
00:26:52,707 --> 00:26:57,081
We did not choose you
to rule us, my lady.

357
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,916
- But perhaps we should have.
- ( all murmuring )

358
00:27:02,415 --> 00:27:07,206
The Knights of the Vale came
here for you, Lady Stark.

359
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:08,665
Men: Aye.

360
00:27:13,124 --> 00:27:16,539
You are very kind,
my lords.

361
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,581
But Jon is our king.

362
00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:21,124
He is doing what
he thinks is best.

363
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:23,750
( chatter )

364
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:33,081
Sansa: I warned Jon
this would happen.

365
00:27:33,082 --> 00:27:34,748
That he couldn't
leave the North

366
00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:37,582
and expect it to just sit
and wait for him like Ghost.

367
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:39,957
He didn't. He trusted
you to hold it for him.

368
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,749
Well, he's not making it easy.
The Northern lords are proud.

369
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,707
These are Mother
and Father's chambers.

370
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:51,249
And?

371
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:56,290
Nothing.

372
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:59,081
Don't do that.

373
00:27:59,082 --> 00:28:01,582
- What?
- Say what you mean.

374
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:05,708
You always liked
nice things.

375
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:09,416
They made you feel
better than everyone.

376
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:15,916
Are you angry with me?

377
00:28:15,917 --> 00:28:18,247
They were insulting Jon,

378
00:28:18,248 --> 00:28:19,624
and you sat there
and listened.

379
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,124
I listened
to their complaints,

380
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:24,166
which is my responsibility
as Lady of Winterfell.

381
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:27,124
Their opinions
are important to you.

382
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:29,832
Glover has 500 men,
Royce has 2,000.

383
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,790
Offend them
and Jon loses his army.

384
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:34,791
Not if they lose
their heads first.

385
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:41,415
Winterfell didn't just
fall into our hands.

386
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:43,290
We took it back,

387
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:45,248
and the Mormonts
and the Hornwoods

388
00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:46,707
and the wildlings
and the Vale.

389
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:48,248
All of us,
working together.

390
00:28:48,249 --> 00:28:52,582
Now, I'm sure cutting off
heads is very satisfying,

391
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:56,125
but that's not the way you
get people to work together.

392
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:01,582
And if Jon
doesn't come back,

393
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:03,540
you'll need
their support...

394
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,665
so you can
work together

395
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:07,625
to give you
what you really want.

396
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:10,209
How can you even think
such a horrible thing?

397
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,958
You're thinking it
right now.

398
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:19,917
You don't want to be,

399
00:29:19,918 --> 00:29:22,208
but the thought
just won't go away.

400
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:30,001
I have work to do.

401
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:34,958
My lady.

402
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,333
( door opens, closes )

403
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:50,249
Last time I was here, I killed
my father with a crossbow.

404
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:53,209
Last time I was here, you
killed my son with wildfire.

405
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:59,208
There's a path to the left
that hugs the cliff.

406
00:29:59,209 --> 00:30:01,875
The guards
hardly ever patrol it.

407
00:30:01,876 --> 00:30:03,250
Too many steps.

408
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:09,416
You're not
staying here?

409
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:12,917
I've got my own business
in Flea Bottom.

410
00:30:12,918 --> 00:30:14,750
What if someone
takes the boat?

411
00:30:14,751 --> 00:30:17,043
Then we're fucked.
Best hurry.

412
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:23,875
We don't have time
for this.

413
00:30:23,876 --> 00:30:26,042
We should be preparing
the city for a siege.

414
00:30:26,043 --> 00:30:27,208
The Dothraki
are coming.

415
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:29,333
All the more reason
for you to train.

416
00:30:29,334 --> 00:30:31,333
Unless you plan on fighting
Dothraki 12-year-olds.

417
00:30:31,334 --> 00:30:33,875
Well, I seem to recall them giving
you a bit of trouble as well.

418
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:35,875
And here I am,
ready to train.

419
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,834
Why down here?

420
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:39,666
I don't think
you want people to see

421
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:42,583
how you look swinging
that thing yet.

422
00:30:42,584 --> 00:30:45,374
Today might be the day
I kill you by accident.

423
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:47,919
Oh, you won't be
swinging it at me.

424
00:30:56,126 --> 00:30:57,793
I'll leave you
to it.

425
00:31:01,584 --> 00:31:02,918
I needed to see you.

426
00:31:04,376 --> 00:31:06,209
And I knew you'd
never agree to meet.

427
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:12,708
You made me look
like a complete fool.

428
00:31:12,709 --> 00:31:15,000
I thought I'd surprise you
by hitting Casterly Rock,

429
00:31:15,001 --> 00:31:17,958
but you were
three steps ahead of me.

430
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,542
Abandoned the family home,
completely unsentimental.

431
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:22,042
Father would have
been proud.

432
00:31:22,043 --> 00:31:23,792
- Don't talk about Father.
- Listen to me...

433
00:31:23,793 --> 00:31:25,291
I once told Bronn

434
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:28,126
that if I ever saw you
again, I'd cut you in half.

435
00:31:31,127 --> 00:31:33,627
It'll take you a while
with a sparring sword.

436
00:31:42,793 --> 00:31:44,708
He was going to execute me.

437
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:47,417
He knew
I was innocent.

438
00:31:47,418 --> 00:31:49,751
He didn't hate me
because of anything I did,

439
00:31:49,752 --> 00:31:52,126
he hated me
because of what I am.

440
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:55,293
A little monster
sent to punish him.

441
00:31:57,169 --> 00:31:59,375
Did he...
did he think...

442
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,169
did he think I wanted
to be born this way?

443
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,089
- Did he think I chose it...
- What do you want?!

444
00:32:09,585 --> 00:32:11,128
Daenerys will
win this war.

445
00:32:13,501 --> 00:32:14,918
You're
a military man.

446
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:17,669
You must know there's
no way around that.

447
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,292
Daenerys
is not her father.

448
00:32:21,293 --> 00:32:24,169
She's even willing
to suspend the hostilities

449
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,668
if Cersei agrees
to certain terms.

450
00:32:27,836 --> 00:32:29,209
If you want Cersei
to bend the knee,

451
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,668
you can ask her
yourself.

452
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:33,044
I... I don't.
And Daenerys doesn't.

453
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:36,169
Not right now,
anyway.

454
00:32:38,335 --> 00:32:40,586
She has a more
important request.

455
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,210
( chatter )

456
00:33:20,086 --> 00:33:22,294
I wasn't sure
I'd find you.

457
00:33:29,586 --> 00:33:31,585
Thought you might
still be rowing.

458
00:33:31,586 --> 00:33:33,753
( chuckles )

459
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:38,293
I looked in shops,
taverns, brothels.

460
00:33:38,294 --> 00:33:41,585
Should have known to come
straight to the Street of Steel.

461
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:44,085
Aren't you worried
about the gold cloaks?

462
00:33:44,086 --> 00:33:45,501
Haven't been here
in years.

463
00:33:45,502 --> 00:33:47,920
Why should
they recognize me?

464
00:33:47,921 --> 00:33:50,586
Sometimes I hardly do.

465
00:33:52,252 --> 00:33:54,420
Nothing fucks you
harder than time.

466
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:01,293
Anybody give you
any trouble?

467
00:34:01,294 --> 00:34:03,753
Here I am,
arming Lannisters,

468
00:34:03,754 --> 00:34:05,627
and I never get
a second look.

469
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:07,128
But you were right.

470
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:09,668
Safest place for me was
right under the queen's nose.

471
00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:11,170
Don't be so sure.

472
00:34:11,171 --> 00:34:14,087
Safety is never a permanent
state of affairs.

473
00:34:16,294 --> 00:34:17,837
Bad things are coming.

474
00:34:20,337 --> 00:34:23,294
You came to get me.
You want me to come with you.

475
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:25,418
- Well, the thing you need to understand is...
- I'm ready.

476
00:34:25,419 --> 00:34:26,878
- You...
- Let's go.

477
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,793
You should know
what you're heading into.

478
00:34:28,794 --> 00:34:30,794
What do you think
I've been thinking about

479
00:34:30,795 --> 00:34:32,169
with every swing
of the hammer?

480
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,627
How happy I am
making weapons

481
00:34:34,628 --> 00:34:37,086
for the family
that killed my father?

482
00:34:37,087 --> 00:34:38,793
The family that
tried to kill me?

483
00:34:38,794 --> 00:34:40,920
( scoffs )

484
00:34:40,921 --> 00:34:43,170
I've been getting ready.

485
00:34:43,171 --> 00:34:44,627
I never knew what for,

486
00:34:44,628 --> 00:34:47,171
but I've always known
I'd know it when it comes.

487
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,919
You might want to bring
one of those swords.

488
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,837
I don't know much
about swinging swords.

489
00:34:55,337 --> 00:34:56,670
But this...

490
00:34:58,503 --> 00:34:59,837
this I know.

491
00:35:08,921 --> 00:35:10,336
Keep your father's name
to yourself.

492
00:35:10,337 --> 00:35:13,129
Situation's complicated
enough already.

493
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:16,171
Well, who should
I say I am?

494
00:35:20,004 --> 00:35:22,419
I told you, Clovis, if we
don't get out of here soon,

495
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,301
- someone's going to...
- Gold cloak: You there!

496
00:35:26,545 --> 00:35:28,879
No weapons, friends.
I promise.

497
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:31,544
What can I do
for you?

498
00:35:31,545 --> 00:35:34,046
- Is that your boat?
- It is.

499
00:35:34,047 --> 00:35:36,461
- Gold cloak: The docks are that way.
- Davos: That they are.

500
00:35:36,462 --> 00:35:37,961
I try to stay
away from them

501
00:35:37,962 --> 00:35:40,212
to avoid good men
such as yourselves.

502
00:35:42,837 --> 00:35:46,211
- Still five gold dragons?
- ( laughs ) Are you joking?

503
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:48,461
You must be even older
than you look.

504
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:50,378
- 15.
- 15?!

505
00:35:50,379 --> 00:35:51,503
Apiece.

506
00:35:53,004 --> 00:35:54,546
- ( sighs )
- ( coins jingling )

507
00:35:59,922 --> 00:36:02,046
I can't say it was a pleasure
doing business with you.

508
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:05,921
Gold cloak #2:
What's in the boat?

509
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:12,628
Not more gold.

510
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,378
- Wine?
- Mm.

511
00:36:14,379 --> 00:36:16,379
- I like wine.
- Or hams.

512
00:36:18,295 --> 00:36:19,421
Come have a look.

513
00:36:27,962 --> 00:36:29,879
- Fermented crab.
- What?

514
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,753
Davos:
Fermented crab.

515
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:34,753
One bucket of this triples a
brothel's earnings for the week.

516
00:36:34,754 --> 00:36:36,712
A man thinks he's done.

517
00:36:36,713 --> 00:36:39,295
He's ready to go back
to his loving family.

518
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,212
But before he gets
his breeches up,

519
00:36:41,213 --> 00:36:44,586
his lady of the hour pops a tiny
spoon of that into his mouth.

520
00:36:44,587 --> 00:36:48,128
Five minutes later,
he's back in the race.

521
00:36:48,129 --> 00:36:50,630
Here, have a taste.

522
00:37:03,296 --> 00:37:05,171
I'd hurry to your
favorite establishment,

523
00:37:05,172 --> 00:37:07,671
or you'll put a hole
in that chainmail.

524
00:37:07,672 --> 00:37:09,963
( laughing )

525
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:16,421
( chattering )

526
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:36,672
Oi, dwarf!

527
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,545
I really wouldn't
try any more

528
00:37:39,546 --> 00:37:41,587
until you see how
the first bite hits you.

529
00:37:41,588 --> 00:37:43,463
That dwarf...

530
00:37:43,464 --> 00:37:45,087
Where'd you get
that scar?

531
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,630
Fish hook. Some men
you just can't teach.

532
00:37:47,631 --> 00:37:50,713
We was looking for a dwarf with
a scar like that a while back.

533
00:37:50,714 --> 00:37:52,755
Davos: Perhaps there's
some arrangement?

534
00:37:52,756 --> 00:37:55,171
( coins jingle )

535
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:57,130
Arrangement?

536
00:37:57,131 --> 00:38:00,338
You gonna arrange to pay us
more than Queen Cersei...

537
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:02,213
( grunting )

538
00:38:08,172 --> 00:38:09,880
- ( sighs )
- This is Gendry.

539
00:38:09,881 --> 00:38:11,379
He'll do.

540
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:15,088
Go, go, go.

541
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,379
Qyburn:
I could give you something.

542
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,881
That won't
be necessary.

543
00:38:29,547 --> 00:38:30,547
Ser Jaime.

544
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,048
- ( door closes )
- Why was Qyburn here?

545
00:38:37,464 --> 00:38:39,714
He's the Hand of the Queen.
Why are you here?

546
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:46,923
I met with Tyrion.

547
00:38:54,797 --> 00:38:57,548
What did our brother
have to say?

548
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:02,588
Daenerys
wants to meet.

549
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:05,213
To discuss
her surrender?

550
00:39:05,214 --> 00:39:07,048
To discuss
an armistice.

551
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:09,838
She's just won a great victory.
Why would she want a truce now?

552
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,588
Because an army
of dead men

553
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:14,132
is marching
on the Seven Kingdoms.

554
00:39:16,632 --> 00:39:18,463
Tyrion claims
he'll have proof.

555
00:39:18,464 --> 00:39:19,882
( chuckles )

556
00:39:22,339 --> 00:39:24,713
- Are you going to punish him?
- Tyrion?

557
00:39:24,714 --> 00:39:26,215
Bronn.

558
00:39:28,756 --> 00:39:31,131
He betrayed you.

559
00:39:31,132 --> 00:39:33,506
He set up a meeting without
your knowledge or consent.

560
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,630
Do you think
anything of importance

561
00:39:38,631 --> 00:39:41,131
happens in this city
without me knowing?

562
00:39:41,132 --> 00:39:44,380
You let it happen.
Why?

563
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:47,048
I've come
to believe that

564
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:49,756
an accommodation
with the Dragon Queen

565
00:39:49,757 --> 00:39:52,297
could be in our
immediate interest.

566
00:39:52,298 --> 00:39:55,631
She has the numbers. If we want to
beat her, we have to be clever.

567
00:39:55,632 --> 00:39:57,798
We have to fight her
like Father would have.

568
00:40:01,255 --> 00:40:04,423
Dead men, dragons,
and Dragon Queens...

569
00:40:06,465 --> 00:40:09,464
Whatever stands
in our way,

570
00:40:09,465 --> 00:40:11,213
we will defeat it.

571
00:40:11,214 --> 00:40:14,006
For ourselves,
for our house,

572
00:40:14,007 --> 00:40:16,007
for this.

573
00:40:28,632 --> 00:40:30,214
Who will you say
is the father?

574
00:40:30,215 --> 00:40:31,506
You.

575
00:40:37,424 --> 00:40:38,673
People won't like that.

576
00:40:42,298 --> 00:40:46,714
Do you remember what Father
used to say about people?

577
00:40:46,715 --> 00:40:50,674
The lion does not concern himself
with the opinions of the sheep.

578
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,549
Never betray me again.

579
00:41:11,632 --> 00:41:13,548
Davos:
We're leaving today.

580
00:41:13,549 --> 00:41:17,132
- The king's got a lot on his mind.
- I understand.

581
00:41:17,133 --> 00:41:19,715
He doesn't need to be thinking about
harboring the bastard of a dead king.

582
00:41:19,716 --> 00:41:22,173
- You don't have to worry.
- You're just Clovis,

583
00:41:22,174 --> 00:41:24,505
a smith who's come
to pay his respects

584
00:41:24,506 --> 00:41:27,506
before he heads off to work
at the Winterfell forges.

585
00:41:27,507 --> 00:41:29,506
Understood.

586
00:41:29,507 --> 00:41:30,965
- ( hammering )
- ( chatter )

587
00:41:30,966 --> 00:41:33,132
Begging your pardon,
Your Grace.

588
00:41:33,133 --> 00:41:34,589
You survived King's Landing.

589
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:37,590
Yet again.
Your Grace, this is Clo...

590
00:41:37,591 --> 00:41:40,007
Name's Gendry,
Your Grace.

591
00:41:40,008 --> 00:41:41,589
I'm Robert Baratheon's son.

592
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,716
Bastard son.

593
00:41:45,799 --> 00:41:48,256
He was meant
to keep that to himself.

594
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:50,090
Our fathers
trusted each other.

595
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,424
Why shouldn't we?

596
00:41:53,716 --> 00:41:56,215
I saw your father once
at Winterfell.

597
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:59,424
I met yours
in my shop.

598
00:42:01,134 --> 00:42:03,466
- You're a lot leaner.
- And you're a lot shorter.

599
00:42:13,549 --> 00:42:17,341
I grew up on
stories about them.

600
00:42:17,342 --> 00:42:20,341
All I ever knew is that
they fought together and won.

601
00:42:22,091 --> 00:42:24,882
Ser Davos told me where you're
going, Your Grace, and why.

602
00:42:24,883 --> 00:42:26,673
Let me come
with you.

603
00:42:26,674 --> 00:42:28,548
Don't be a fool.
You're not a soldier.

604
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:30,382
No,
but I'm a fighter.

605
00:42:30,383 --> 00:42:33,467
And he won't be needing a
smith with a sword like that.

606
00:42:35,883 --> 00:42:37,382
You know
how to use one?

607
00:42:37,383 --> 00:42:39,758
Well,
that's a problem.

608
00:42:39,759 --> 00:42:41,299
I prefer a hammer.

609
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,008
He can handle himself.

610
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,883
We could use the help.

611
00:42:49,884 --> 00:42:51,757
As my father
used to say,

612
00:42:51,758 --> 00:42:53,841
"It's better to be
a coward for a minute,

613
00:42:53,842 --> 00:42:56,091
than dead for
the rest of your life."

614
00:42:56,092 --> 00:42:58,506
I owe you my life.

615
00:42:58,507 --> 00:43:00,299
Twice over.

616
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,549
But if what you said is true
about what's up there,

617
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:06,009
I can't wait out
this war.

618
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,715
Yeah, nobody mind me.

619
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:15,758
All I've ever done
is live to a ripe old age.

620
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,674
Man:
All right, come on.

621
00:43:17,675 --> 00:43:18,675
( grunts )

622
00:43:27,258 --> 00:43:29,507
Tyrion:
You may not believe it,

623
00:43:29,508 --> 00:43:32,216
but I've missed you,
Mormont.

624
00:43:32,217 --> 00:43:35,341
Nobody glowers
quite like you.

625
00:43:35,342 --> 00:43:36,634
Not even Grey Worm.

626
00:43:42,425 --> 00:43:44,383
This is the coin
the slaver gave me

627
00:43:44,384 --> 00:43:47,382
when I suggested he free us
and pay us, remember?

628
00:43:47,383 --> 00:43:51,217
It was supposed to last us
the rest of our lives.

629
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,051
Take it with you.

630
00:43:59,717 --> 00:44:01,216
But bring it back.

631
00:44:01,217 --> 00:44:02,383
Our queen needs you.

632
00:44:11,759 --> 00:44:14,218
We should be better
at saying farewell by now.

633
00:44:15,884 --> 00:44:17,384
Your Grace, I...

634
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,051
If I don't return, at least
you won't have to deal

635
00:44:37,052 --> 00:44:38,411
with the King
in the North anymore.

636
00:44:40,718 --> 00:44:42,593
I've grown used to him.

637
00:44:44,675 --> 00:44:47,301
I wish you good fortune in the
wars to come, Your Grace.

638
00:44:56,384 --> 00:44:58,051
Heave!

639
00:45:18,968 --> 00:45:21,176
( fire crackling )

640
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:25,634
Gilly: Do you know how many
steps there are in the Citadel?

641
00:45:25,635 --> 00:45:26,842
No.

642
00:45:26,843 --> 00:45:29,801
15,782.

643
00:45:34,385 --> 00:45:37,801
Guess how many windows are
in the Great Sept of Baelor.

644
00:45:39,927 --> 00:45:42,467
None anymore.

645
00:45:42,468 --> 00:45:44,135
That's true.

646
00:45:44,136 --> 00:45:48,467
This High Septon Maynard,
he recorded everything.

647
00:45:48,468 --> 00:45:50,677
He even recorded
his own bowel movements.

648
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:57,426
What does
"annulment" mean?

649
00:45:57,427 --> 00:46:01,300
It's when a man
sets aside his lawful wife.

650
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:06,676
Maynard says here that he issued
an annulment for a Prince "Ragger"

651
00:46:06,677 --> 00:46:10,177
and remarried him to someone
else at the same time

652
00:46:10,178 --> 00:46:12,718
in a secret ceremony
in Dorne.

653
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:14,634
Is that a common thing
in the south or...?

654
00:46:14,635 --> 00:46:16,011
These maesters...

655
00:46:17,885 --> 00:46:21,467
they set me to the task of preserving
that man's window counting

656
00:46:21,468 --> 00:46:23,760
and annulments and bowel
movements for all eternity,

657
00:46:23,761 --> 00:46:25,551
while the secret to
defeating the Night King's

658
00:46:25,552 --> 00:46:28,217
probably sitting on some dusty shelf
somewhere, completely ignored.

659
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:30,135
But that's all right,
isn't it?

660
00:46:30,136 --> 00:46:34,218
We can all become slavering, murderous
imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate

661
00:46:34,219 --> 00:46:35,843
as long as we can have access
to the full records

662
00:46:35,844 --> 00:46:39,886
of High Septon Maynard's
15,782 shits!

663
00:46:42,219 --> 00:46:43,844
Steps.

664
00:46:46,886 --> 00:46:49,011
That number
was the steps.

665
00:46:54,552 --> 00:46:55,594
( giggles )

666
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:13,552
Are you sure
you want to do this?

667
00:48:13,553 --> 00:48:15,970
You always wanted
to be a maester.

668
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:21,762
I'm tired of reading about
the achievements of better men.

669
00:48:40,012 --> 00:48:42,137
- ( whispering )
- ( horse whinnies )

670
00:49:01,013 --> 00:49:02,511
( dog barking )

671
00:49:19,511 --> 00:49:22,386
( quiet chatter )

672
00:49:50,846 --> 00:49:52,721
Wolkan:
I found it, my lord.

673
00:49:56,429 --> 00:49:58,136
It, uh, took
some searching.

674
00:49:58,137 --> 00:50:00,221
Maester Luwin's archives
are very thorough.

675
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:07,553
You're sure this is the
only copy in Winterfell?

676
00:50:07,554 --> 00:50:09,429
Uh, yes, my lord.

677
00:50:14,221 --> 00:50:16,138
Lady Stark thanks you
for your service.

678
00:50:35,846 --> 00:50:37,513
( door closes, lock clicks )

679
00:52:48,263 --> 00:52:50,139
Tormund: Isn't it your
job to talk him out

680
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:52,138
of stupid fucking
ideas like this?

681
00:52:52,139 --> 00:52:54,931
I've been failing
at that job of late.

682
00:52:56,556 --> 00:52:58,596
How many queens
are there now?

683
00:52:58,597 --> 00:52:59,931
Two.

684
00:52:59,932 --> 00:53:03,097
And you need to convince
the one with the dragons

685
00:53:03,098 --> 00:53:04,930
or the one who
fucks her brother?

686
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,764
( chuckles )

687
00:53:06,765 --> 00:53:07,764
Both.

688
00:53:07,765 --> 00:53:09,806
How many men
did you bring?

689
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,429
Jon:
Not enough.

690
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:16,057
The big woman?

691
00:53:19,389 --> 00:53:22,181
We were hoping some of
your men could help.

692
00:53:22,182 --> 00:53:25,014
- Hmm.
- I'll be staying behind.

693
00:53:25,015 --> 00:53:28,139
I'm a liability out there,
as you well know.

694
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,140
You are.

695
00:53:31,932 --> 00:53:35,140
You really want to go out there?
Again?

696
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:43,182
You're not
the only ones.

697
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:50,305
My scouts found them
a mile south of the Wall.

698
00:53:50,306 --> 00:53:52,182
Said they were
on their way here.

699
00:53:59,015 --> 00:54:00,474
You're the Hound.

700
00:54:02,473 --> 00:54:04,307
I saw you once
at Winterfell.

701
00:54:10,016 --> 00:54:12,181
They want to go
beyond the Wall, too.

702
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:15,472
We don't want to go beyond
the Wall, we have to.

703
00:54:15,473 --> 00:54:17,640
Our Lord told us that
the Great War is coming...

704
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:19,848
Gendry:
Don't trust him.

705
00:54:19,849 --> 00:54:21,806
Don't trust
any of them.

706
00:54:27,432 --> 00:54:29,056
They're the Brotherhood.

707
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,639
And the last thing
their lord told them to do

708
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,015
was sell me to a red witch
to be murdered.

709
00:54:34,016 --> 00:54:35,723
Jorah:
Thoros?

710
00:54:40,766 --> 00:54:42,848
I hardly
recognized you.

711
00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:45,056
Ser Jorah Mormont.

712
00:54:45,057 --> 00:54:48,014
They won't give me anything
to drink down here.

713
00:54:48,015 --> 00:54:51,056
I haven't been feeling
like myself.

714
00:54:51,057 --> 00:54:53,890
Tormund:
You're a fucking Mormont?

715
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:56,015
Like the last
Lord Commander?

716
00:54:56,016 --> 00:54:58,222
He was my father.

717
00:54:58,223 --> 00:55:01,222
He hunted us
like animals.

718
00:55:01,223 --> 00:55:04,264
You returned the favor,
as I recall.

719
00:55:04,265 --> 00:55:05,932
( growls )

720
00:55:05,933 --> 00:55:08,556
Here we all are

721
00:55:08,557 --> 00:55:10,140
at the edge
of the world

722
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:11,723
at the same moment,

723
00:55:11,724 --> 00:55:14,224
heading in the same direction
for the same reason.

724
00:55:16,058 --> 00:55:18,306
Our reasons
aren't your reasons.

725
00:55:18,307 --> 00:55:20,682
It doesn't matter
what we think our reasons are.

726
00:55:22,891 --> 00:55:24,681
There's a greater
purpose at work.

727
00:55:24,682 --> 00:55:27,973
And we serve it
together,

728
00:55:27,974 --> 00:55:30,264
whether we
know it or not.

729
00:55:30,265 --> 00:55:33,182
We may take the steps,
but the Lord of Light...

730
00:55:33,183 --> 00:55:36,556
For fuck's sake,
will you shut your hole?

731
00:55:36,557 --> 00:55:39,348
Are we coming
with you or not?

732
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:41,556
Don't you want to know
what we're doing?

733
00:55:41,557 --> 00:55:45,973
Is it worse than sitting in a
freezing cell, waiting to die?

734
00:55:45,974 --> 00:55:47,973
He's right.

735
00:55:47,974 --> 00:55:49,975
We're all
on the same side.

736
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,600
How can we be?

737
00:55:55,224 --> 00:55:57,307
We're all breathing.

738
00:56:05,224 --> 00:56:07,100
( gate rumbling )

739
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:12,016
( wind howling )

740
00:57:10,851 --> 00:57:13,683
( music playing )

9999
