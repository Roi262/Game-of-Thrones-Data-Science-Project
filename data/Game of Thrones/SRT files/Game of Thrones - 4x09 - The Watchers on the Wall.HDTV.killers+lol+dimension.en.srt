<i>( men shouting )</i>

5
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,938
What was she like?

6
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,275
She…

7
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,580
she had red hair.

8
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,250
Oh?

9
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,702
– How big were her feet?
– What do you want me to say?

10
00:02:41,753 --> 00:02:45,089
I want you to tell me what
it was like to have someone.

11
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,091
To be with someone.

12
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,485
To love someone and have
them love you back.

13
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:56,350
We’re all gonna die a lot
sooner than I’d planned.

14
00:02:56,385 --> 00:03:00,021
You’re the closest
I’ll ever get to knowing.

15
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,142
So you and Gilly never?

16
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:06,477
No.

17
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:08,813
She just had a baby.

18
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:12,984
And she never offered.

19
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:15,486
But if she had,

20
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:18,155
you would have?

21
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:20,992
You’d have broken your vows?

22
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,998
The interesting thing is,

23
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,084
our vows never
specifically forbid

24
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:32,136
intimate relations with women.

25
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,804
What?

26
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:37,258
«I shall take no wife,» yes, that’s in there.
There’s no denying that.

27
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:39,727
«I shall father no children.»
It’s very specific.

28
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,513
But what do our vows
have to say about other…

29
00:03:42,564 --> 00:03:45,733
activities is open
to interpretation.

30
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:51,188
I don’t think Ser Alliser
cares much for interpretation.

31
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,696
Anyway, there’s nothing
for him to interpret.

32
00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:00,698
We didn’t.

33
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,087
So what’s it like?

34
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:09,674
It’s…

35
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,712
there’s this person,
this whole other person.

36
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:18,132
And you’re wrapped up in them
and they’re wrapped up in you.

37
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:20,351
And you–

38
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,386
for a little–

39
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:24,722
for a little while,
you’re more than just you.

40
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:28,025
You’re– I don’t know.
I’m not a bleeding poet.

41
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,944
No, you’re really not.

42
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,862
What did I get for it?

43
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,815
An arrow six inches
from my heart.

44
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,903
There’ll be arrows for all
of us soon, I imagine.

45
00:04:38,954 --> 00:04:40,571
There will.

46
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:43,933
They’ve already done the worst
thing to me they could ever do.

47
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,746
Go get some sleep, Sam.

48
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:51,048
I’ll take this watch.

49
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:19,076
( screeches )

50
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,865
( screeches )

51
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,677
Did I ever tell you about her?

52
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,797
– My Sheila?
– Yes.

53
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:42,133
That was a night to remember.

54
00:05:42,184 --> 00:05:45,636
Of course, I’d had
a good bit to drink.

55
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:47,355
( chuckles )

56
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,856
Her fangs were sharp,

57
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,108
but she knew how to use them.

58
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:54,895
And she was nice
and soft down below.

59
00:05:54,946 --> 00:05:57,531
No, she was no ordinary beast.

60
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,450
Many is the man who–

61
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,569
I know you never fucked a bear.

62
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,372
You know you never
fucked a bear.

63
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,658
Right now I don’t want to think
about the bear you never fucked.

64
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:10,828
Right now all I want
to think about

65
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,631
is each one of these arrows finding
its way into a crow’s heart.

66
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,218
We could be waiting
here a while.

67
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,586
Good.

68
00:06:18,637 --> 00:06:20,918
The longer we wait,
the more arrows I’ll have.

69
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,229
They came up here to our land

70
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,815
and put up a big wall
and said it was theirs.

71
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,234
Then they started
hunting us down.

72
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,572
This time, we’re the ones
doing the hunting.

73
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:43,077
You’ve got a lot
to say about killing.

74
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,196
Even more words than arrows.

75
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,700
Back in those villages, I killed
just as many of them as you did.

76
00:06:49,751 --> 00:06:51,752
More, I reckon.

77
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:55,873
Yes, but none of those
were your crow lover.

78
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,675
I probably killed him already.

79
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,126
Styr: – <i>So you’ve said.</i>

80
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:01,345
And if not,

81
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,049
the only thing left of him is gonna be
his fun bits hanging around my neck.

82
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:06,892
Styr: – <i>More words.</i>

83
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:09,270
Know what I think
you do when you see him?

84
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:13,140
Serve him up a nice juicy
slice of ginger minge.

85
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:16,110
( men laughing )

86
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,530
You been thinking
about that ginger minge?

87
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:28,421
Wondering what Maybe I have.

88
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:30,957
Jon Snow is mine.

89
00:07:32,793 --> 00:07:34,913
Anyone else tries to kill him,

90
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:37,680
I’ll have an arrow for them.

91
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:44,136
And not one of your bald friends
is fast enough to stop me.

92
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:10,129
And what is it that couldn’t
wait until morning, Tarly?

93
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:12,298
Maester Aemon.

94
00:08:12,332 --> 00:08:14,834
– How did you know–
– That it was you?

95
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:17,470
Who else but Samwell Tarly

96
00:08:17,504 --> 00:08:19,388
would be wasting candles

97
00:08:19,423 --> 00:08:22,058
to read in the middle
of the night?

98
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:28,180
– Let me help you.
– Oh, no need.

99
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:31,567
I know my way
around this library

100
00:08:31,602 --> 00:08:34,186
better than any other
place in Castle Black.

101
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:36,522
Thousands of books

102
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:38,858
and no eyes to read them.

103
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,912
Old age is a wonderful
source of ironies

104
00:08:42,946 --> 00:08:45,114
if nothing else.

105
00:08:45,165 --> 00:08:47,667
But you didn’t
answer my question.

106
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,285
What are you reading?

107
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:51,704
Maester Faull.

108
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:54,707
Ah, the wildlings.

109
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:58,294
I can assure you that
the closest Maester Faull

110
00:08:58,345 --> 00:09:01,714
ever got to a wildling
was this very library.

111
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:04,684
But what he says
about what they do,

112
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:06,185
it’s all true.

113
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:09,889
It’s exactly what the survivors
of their raids report.

114
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,777
Yes, imagine the stories
wildlings tell about us.

115
00:09:16,313 --> 00:09:19,231
Love is the death of duty.

116
00:09:20,484 --> 00:09:22,985
I told that to your friend
Jon Snow once.

117
00:09:23,036 --> 00:09:27,239
He didn’t listen
and neither did you.

118
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:31,243
Which is why you’ve abandoned
your watch atop the Wall

119
00:09:31,294 --> 00:09:35,247
to come here and read
about the terrible things

120
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:39,418
that may have happened
to the girl you love.

121
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,421
I don’t love her.

122
00:09:42,472 --> 00:09:44,423
– Yes, you do.
– No.

123
00:09:44,425 --> 00:09:46,142
Yes, you do.

124
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:50,346
Heard it in your voice when
you first brought her to me.

125
00:09:50,397 --> 00:09:52,598
I remember how it sounds.

126
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:54,600
I was in love once.

127
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:55,935
You were?

128
00:09:55,937 --> 00:10:00,272
You can imagine
all manner of horrors

129
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:02,942
befalling that poor
girl and her child.

130
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:05,745
Is it so difficult to imagine

131
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,663
that an old person was once,

132
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:09,865
more or less, like you?

133
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,535
I’m sorry, Maester.

134
00:10:12,586 --> 00:10:14,286
I didn’t mean it like that.

135
00:10:14,337 --> 00:10:18,224
Do you know who I was
before I came here?

136
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:22,294
What I could have been
if I’d only said the word?

137
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:25,631
Of course you do.

138
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:29,385
I met many girls
when I was Aemon Targaryen.

139
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:33,305
A future king always does.

140
00:10:34,307 --> 00:10:36,942
Some of them were quite forward

141
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:39,645
in their attempts
to win my affections.

142
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:43,115
One of them succeeded.

143
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:46,035
I was very young.

144
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:48,687
Who was she?

145
00:10:48,722 --> 00:10:50,656
Ah.

146
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:53,242
I could tell you
everything about her.

147
00:10:53,293 --> 00:10:55,161
Who she was,

148
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:56,962
how we met,

149
00:10:56,997 --> 00:10:59,131
the color of her eyes,

150
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,901
and the shape of her nose.

151
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:05,971
I can see her

152
00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:08,841
right in front of me.

153
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:14,263
She’s more real than you are.

154
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,687
We could spend all night
trading tales of lost loves.

155
00:11:21,738 --> 00:11:24,523
Nothing makes the past
a sweeter place to visit

156
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:27,726
than the prospect
of imminent death.

157
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:30,079
Go to bed, Tarly.

158
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:38,671
Pyp: – <i> Sorry, I can’t open the
gate for anybody. Orders.</i>

159
00:11:38,705 --> 00:11:40,956
Gilly: – <i> You don’t understand.
They killed everyone.</i>

160
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:43,042
<i>Everyone but me and my baby.</i>

161
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:45,461
<i>They’re out there.</i>
<i>I saw them on my way here.</i>

162
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:47,753
<i>They may have seen me. They
may have followed me. Please.</i>

163
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:49,181
Pyp: – <i>I’m sorry, I can’t.</i>

164
00:11:49,216 --> 00:11:50,549
Gilly: – <i> If they find us out
here, you don’t know…</i>

165
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,384
Pyp!
Open the gate.

166
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:55,137
– I can’t.
– Sam, is that you?

167
00:11:55,188 --> 00:11:57,306
Yes.

168
00:11:57,357 --> 00:11:59,391
Thorne gave me strict
orders to not open the gate.

169
00:11:59,393 --> 00:12:02,027
Oh, Pyp, open the fucking gate!

170
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,064
I never heard you curse before.

171
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:07,199
Yes, well, best get used to it.

172
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,124
Are you all right?

173
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:17,076
– ( panting )
– ( baby fusses )

174
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:19,662
Shh, you’re all right.

175
00:12:19,713 --> 00:12:23,582
Of course you are,
my brave little fella.

176
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:26,302
– It was horrible.
– I’m so, so sorry.

177
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:28,137
I didn’t know until I got back.

178
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:29,638
Don’t let them
send me away, Sam.

179
00:12:29,673 --> 00:12:31,557
– Never.
– I know there’s no women allowed.

180
00:12:31,591 --> 00:12:35,060
Anyone who tries to throw you out
will be having words with me.

181
00:12:35,095 --> 00:12:38,097
From now on, wherever you go,

182
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:40,599
I go, too.

183
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:47,156
<i>( horn blows )</i>

184
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:50,659
<i>( horn blows )</i>

185
00:12:50,694 --> 00:12:52,528
Man: – <i>Get ready!</i>

186
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:54,747
– <i> Man the gate!</i>
– <i> Ready yourselves!</i>

187
00:12:54,781 --> 00:12:56,832
<i>Make haste!</i>

188
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:58,951
– <i> Prepare!</i>
– <i> Up on the Wall!</i>

189
00:12:59,002 --> 00:13:00,563
<i>Quickly!</i>
<i>Up! Up!</i>

190
00:13:00,587 --> 00:13:03,789
<i>How many?</i>
<i>How many are there?</i>

191
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:06,091
– <i> ( horn blows )</i>
– ( screeches )

192
00:13:06,126 --> 00:13:07,960
Beyond the trees!

193
00:13:11,798 --> 00:13:13,933
It’s time.

194
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:31,650
( men shouting )

195
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:35,537
<i>( horn blows )</i>

196
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:03,599
Light them up!
Light them all!

197
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,735
– <i> ( horn blowing )</i>
– ( men shouting )

198
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:15,027
Move!

199
00:14:17,697 --> 00:14:19,031
Pick up the pace!

200
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:21,083
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

201
00:14:27,757 --> 00:14:30,342
Here we go, boys, there’s one.

202
00:14:30,377 --> 00:14:33,545
Let’s go.
There’s two.

203
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:38,634
Let’s get the next load.

204
00:14:41,554 --> 00:14:44,056
That’s the last
of the oil, Ser Alliser.

205
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:48,193
100,000 you say?

206
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:50,396
Yes, Ser.

207
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:52,731
You can say it if you like.

208
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:56,618
We should have sealed the
tunnel while we had the chance,

209
00:14:56,653 --> 00:15:00,039
like you suggested.

210
00:15:00,073 --> 00:15:03,292
It was a difficult
decision either way, Ser.

211
00:15:05,462 --> 00:15:09,081
Do you know what leadership
means, Lord Snow?

212
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:12,217
It means that the person in
charge gets second-guessed

213
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:14,837
by every clever little
twat with a mouth.

214
00:15:14,888 --> 00:15:17,256
But if he starts
second-guessing himself,

215
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:19,091
that’s the end–

216
00:15:19,142 --> 00:15:22,594
for him, for the
clever little twats,

217
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:24,313
for everyone.

218
00:15:24,347 --> 00:15:27,316
This is not the end.
Not for us.

219
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,485
Not if you lot do your duty

220
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,071
for however long it takes
to beat them back.

221
00:15:33,523 --> 00:15:36,775
And then you get
to go on hating me

222
00:15:36,777 --> 00:15:38,444
and I get to go on wishing

223
00:15:38,446 --> 00:15:40,946
your wildling whore
had finished the job.

224
00:15:40,948 --> 00:15:43,615
<i>( horn blows )</i>

225
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,771
Sam: – <i>You’ll be safe down here.</i>

226
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:07,689
I’ll check on you
as soon as I can.

227
00:16:07,724 --> 00:16:10,642
You’re leaving me again?

228
00:16:11,728 --> 00:16:13,362
I’m not leaving you.

229
00:16:13,396 --> 00:16:16,148
You’re going up there and we’re
staying down here. That’s leaving.

230
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,567
You said from now on
we’d stay together.

231
00:16:18,618 --> 00:16:21,620
I didn’t mean in the same room.

232
00:16:21,654 --> 00:16:22,988
What are you going
to do out there?

233
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,470
– Help my brothers.
– How?

234
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:28,043
You’re going to fight the
free folk when they come?

235
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:30,913
They’ll kill you. In Mole’s
Town, they killed everyone.

236
00:16:30,964 --> 00:16:34,550
I can’t just hide here with you
while they’re fighting out there.

237
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:37,419
Why not? You won’t
matter up there.

238
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,088
You will down here.

239
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,342
I am a man of
the Night’s Watch, Gilly.

240
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:45,677
I made a promise
to defend the Wall

241
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,513
and I have to keep it

242
00:16:47,564 --> 00:16:50,149
because that’s what men do.

243
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:05,030
Promise me you won’t die.

244
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:11,203
I promise you I won’t die.

245
00:17:18,511 --> 00:17:20,712
<i>( lock clicks )</i>

246
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:24,883
– ( men shouting )
– ( horse whinnies )

247
00:17:45,121 --> 00:17:48,407
There’s a lot more wildlings on the
other side of the Wall than this side.

248
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,577
We’ve got loads
of weapons and things.

249
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:53,495
It’s the perfect place
for us to be.

250
00:17:53,546 --> 00:17:55,747
I’ve never thrown
a spear before.

251
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:58,634
I’ve never held a sword
with a proper edge.

252
00:17:58,668 --> 00:18:01,336
This is no place for me to be.

253
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:04,723
You’re not afraid?

254
00:18:04,757 --> 00:18:07,226
Of course I’m afraid.

255
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,761
There’s a band of wildlings
coming to kill us.

256
00:18:09,763 --> 00:18:11,230
If you’re afraid
of a band of wildlings,

257
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:14,516
how in seven hells did you
manage to kill a white walker?

258
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:22,658
I didn’t know
I was going to kill it.

259
00:18:22,692 --> 00:18:25,444
But I had to do something.
I didn’t have any choice.

260
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:27,446
It was going to kill Gilly
and take the baby.

261
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:32,751
If someone had asked
me my name right then,

262
00:18:32,785 --> 00:18:34,453
I wouldn’t have known.

263
00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:39,174
I wasn’t Samwell Tarly anymore.

264
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:41,960
I wasn’t a steward
in the Night’s Watch

265
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:44,713
or son of Randyll Tarly
or any of that.

266
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:48,050
I was nothing at all.

267
00:18:49,936 --> 00:18:51,887
And when you’re nothing at all,

268
00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:54,556
there’s no more reason
to be afraid.

269
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:58,360
But you’re afraid now?

270
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:00,862
Yes, well…

271
00:19:02,732 --> 00:19:04,816
I’m not nothing anymore.

272
00:19:24,087 --> 00:19:25,504
Most of their men are up top.

273
00:19:25,506 --> 00:19:28,840
Didn’t count more than 20 down here.
Leftovers.

274
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:30,976
They got a big fat one and a
little bony one manning the front.

275
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,511
How high are the walls?

276
00:19:32,513 --> 00:19:35,513
Well, we’ll be up and over before
they know what’s happened.

277
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:39,268
Styr: – Let’s kill some crows!

Slynt, you have the Wall.

She will not fall tonight.

Those are Thenns at our walls.

They eat the flesh

We can’t just let them attack the gate!

345
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:37,004
The bars of those gates are
four inches of cold-rolled steel.

Those are giants riding
mammoths down there!

Do you think your cold-rolled
steel is gonna stop them?

No such thing as giants.

Alliser needs you below.

You’re the most experienced man
he’s got, Ser, and he needs you.

353
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,361
Needed below?

354
00:26:00,412 --> 00:26:02,580
Yes. Yes.

355
00:26:11,757 --> 00:26:15,259
Archers, nock your arrows!

356
00:26:15,294 --> 00:26:17,795
Man: – <i>Nock arrows!</i>

357
00:26:17,846 --> 00:26:19,547
Draw!

358
00:26:21,016 --> 00:26:23,184
Loose!

359
00:26:37,065 --> 00:26:40,315
They won’t summit before dawn.

360
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:42,401
Because I’ve made that climb.

361
00:26:42,452 --> 00:26:45,571
I think they’re in a bigger
hurry than you were.

362
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:50,158
<i>Hold the bridge!</i>

363
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,327
<i>Hold, wait for it!</i>

364
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:55,214
<i>Come on with the rocks!</i>

365
00:27:00,837 --> 00:27:02,304
Nock!

366
00:27:04,224 --> 00:27:05,674
Draw!

367
00:27:09,345 --> 00:27:10,646
Loose!

368
00:27:15,268 --> 00:27:16,985
( screams )

369
00:27:29,616 --> 00:27:31,617
Down!

370
00:27:43,713 --> 00:27:45,297
( screaming )

371
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:02,614
( laughs )

372
00:28:05,735 --> 00:28:08,236
( screaming )
No! No!

373
00:28:27,256 --> 00:28:28,840
To the gate.
Come on, let’s move.

374
00:28:32,895 --> 00:28:34,179
It’s gonna open.

375
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:41,363
I got one right through the heart.
He’s dead.

376
00:29:41,414 --> 00:29:43,782
– Oh, is it over?
– No.

377
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:45,701
Well, then…

378
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:56,295
You’re all right.
You’re all right.

379
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:58,547
<i>( gurgling )</i>

380
00:29:58,598 --> 00:30:00,766
I’ll get help.

381
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,517
Shh. Shh.

382
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:04,853
Maester Aemon is coming.

383
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,805
He’s gonna make it all right.

384
00:30:06,856 --> 00:30:10,142
Shh. Shh.

385
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:20,953
– Now.
– Now!

386
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:48,647
( whistles )

387
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,098
( bellows )

388
00:31:34,794 --> 00:31:37,045
( bellowing )

389
00:31:46,689 --> 00:31:49,390
( gates creaking )

390
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,730
The outer gate won’t hold.

391
00:31:55,732 --> 00:31:58,700
Take five men,
hold the inner gate.

392
00:31:58,734 --> 00:32:00,118
Aye.

393
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,455
Hold the gate.

394
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,791
If they make it through…

395
00:32:09,078 --> 00:32:10,962
They won’t.

396
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:15,667
Come on, Hill.
And you, Cooper.

397
00:32:15,718 --> 00:32:18,887
– You three, on me.
– <i> ( horn blowing )</i>

398
00:32:18,921 --> 00:32:21,222
Come on, you lazy bastards.

399
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:27,095
Oil.

400
00:32:28,097 --> 00:32:30,231
Oil on the ramp!

401
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:41,609
Protect the gate!

402
00:33:07,636 --> 00:33:09,520
( groans )

403
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:16,527
– ( groans )
– Get him inside.

404
00:33:20,649 --> 00:33:22,734
Hold the fucking gate!

405
00:33:22,785 --> 00:33:24,903
Hold it!

406
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:24,879
We need more men down here.

407
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,432
– We have to hold the gate.
– But we need men here.

408
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:29,717
Tell Jon.
He’s in command.

409
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:32,186
Let’s go.

410
00:34:39,812 --> 00:34:42,981
Get me to the top!
You hear me?!

411
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:49,904
Your name’s Olly, right?

412
00:34:49,906 --> 00:34:53,157
Listen to me, Olly.
Get me to the top.

413
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:56,488
And when we give the signal,
bring us back down.

414
00:34:57,379 --> 00:34:58,963
You hear me?

415
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,220
Find a weapon, Olly.
Fight them.

416
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:33,114
( bellows )

417
00:35:33,116 --> 00:35:35,450
( screaming )

418
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:41,155
Clear the way!
Let’s go!

419
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,291
– Out of the way!
– Get out of here!

420
00:35:47,796 --> 00:35:49,764
( grunts )

421
00:35:52,601 --> 00:35:55,520
( roars )

422
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:03,144
Cut the rope!

423
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:05,229
( screams )

424
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:11,819
– Wait! No!
– ( screaming )

425
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:20,795
( roaring )

426
00:36:25,834 --> 00:36:27,885
– <i> We need more archers.</i>
– <i> Here I am.</i>

427
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,254
– <i> Come on.</i>
– <i> Quickly.</i>

428
00:36:32,474 --> 00:36:34,392
What are you doing up here?

429
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:36,928
The wildlings
are over the walls.

430
00:36:36,979 --> 00:36:38,763
Ser Alliser’s fallen.

431
00:36:38,814 --> 00:36:41,482
The castle won’t stand
much longer.

432
00:36:43,185 --> 00:36:46,154
Edd, you have the Wall.

433
00:36:48,407 --> 00:36:50,858
If they try the mammoths
again, drop fire on them.

434
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:53,694
If the climbers get too high,
drop the scythe on them.

435
00:36:59,201 --> 00:37:02,370
Come, brothers.
Now fight with me!

436
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:06,257
Might as well enjoy
our last night, right, boys?

437
00:37:06,341 --> 00:37:08,259
Light the fuckers up!

438
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:11,462
<i>Nock! Draw!</i>

439
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:14,632
Loose!

440
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:24,392
How are we gonna stop that?

441
00:37:24,394 --> 00:37:25,726
Shot 20 arrows in him already.

442
00:37:25,728 --> 00:37:27,195
You heard Jon.
We hold the gate.

443
00:37:27,229 --> 00:37:28,646
Jon Snow’s not Lord Commander.

444
00:37:28,697 --> 00:37:30,364
We hold the gate!

445
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:41,742
Mother, save me.
Father, save me.

446
00:37:41,744 --> 00:37:42,960
The gods aren’t down here.

447
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:44,836
It’s the six of us.
You hear me?

448
00:37:50,586 --> 00:37:53,254
Night gathers
and now my watch begins.

449
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:55,723
<i>It shall not end until my death.</i>

450
00:37:55,757 --> 00:37:58,226
I shall take no wife,
hold no lands,

451
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,844
<i>father no children.</i>

452
00:37:59,895 --> 00:38:02,430
I shall wear no crown
and win no glory.

453
00:38:02,432 --> 00:38:04,649
I shall live and die at my post.

454
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:06,567
All: – I am the sword
in the darkness.

455
00:38:06,602 --> 00:38:08,403
I am the watcher on the walls.

456
00:38:08,437 --> 00:38:11,439
I am the shield that guards
the realms of men.

457
00:38:11,441 --> 00:38:15,493
I pledge my life and honor
to the Night’s Watch

458
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:18,196
for this night
and all the nights to come!

459
00:38:18,247 --> 00:38:20,281
– ( shouting )
– ( roaring )

460
00:38:23,952 --> 00:38:25,419
I don’t want you out there.

461
00:38:25,454 --> 00:38:27,672
You can’t protect me forever.

462
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:30,291
There won’t be anywhere
to hide if the castle falls.

463
00:38:33,128 --> 00:38:35,680
I need him more than I need you.

464
00:39:49,171 --> 00:39:51,706
We need you, boy.

465
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:53,874
<i>( panting )</i>

466
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:15,529

( gasping )

472
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:12,146
Jon Snow.

473
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:15,433
Hush.
Don’t talk.

474
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:22,022
Do you remember the cave?

475
00:42:26,445 --> 00:42:29,246
We should have
stayed in the cave.

476
00:42:33,201 --> 00:42:35,202
We’ll go back there.

477
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:44,628
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

478
00:43:19,881 --> 00:43:22,299
Drop the scythe, boys!

479
00:43:35,931 --> 00:43:38,148
( screams )

480
00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:46,941
– Hoist her up.
– Man:<i> Hoist her up!</i>

481
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:49,944
– <i> ( chain clanking )</i>
– <i> ( men grunting )</i>

482
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:54,949
They’ve had enough
for one night.

483
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,784
( cheering )

484
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,455
Don’t cheer too loud.

485
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:05,876
They still outnumber us
1,000 to one.

486
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:12,016
( groaning )

487
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,134

488
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:15,936
Tormund.

489
00:44:15,971 --> 00:44:18,522
It’s over.

490
00:44:18,557 --> 00:44:19,890
Let it end.

491
00:44:19,941 --> 00:44:22,226
This is how a man ends.

492
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:31,735
Put him in chains.

493
00:44:32,821 --> 00:44:34,655
We’ll question him later.

494
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:39,793
I should have thrown you

495
00:44:39,828 --> 00:44:42,830
from the top of the Wall, boy!

496
00:44:42,832 --> 00:44:44,882
Aye.

497
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:46,967
You should have.

498
00:44:48,003 --> 00:44:50,387
<i>( lock clicking )</i>

499
00:44:51,339 --> 00:44:54,058
<i>( door opens )</i>

500
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:56,760
Whoa, it’s me.
It’s me.

501
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:02,433
I promised you, didn’t I?

502
00:45:05,604 --> 00:45:07,821
<i>( scuffles )</i>

503
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:19,116
Sam: – We held them off.

504
00:45:19,167 --> 00:45:21,118
Jon: – For one night.

505
00:45:21,169 --> 00:45:23,504
This is a great victory.

506
00:45:23,538 --> 00:45:25,706
A great victory?

507
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:29,510
Mance was testing our defenses.

508
00:45:29,544 --> 00:45:31,128
He almost made it through.

509
00:45:31,179 --> 00:45:33,964
And he has more giants.
He has more mammoths.

510
00:45:34,015 --> 00:45:36,717
He has 1,000 times as many men.

511
00:45:40,055 --> 00:45:42,640
They’ll hit us again tonight.

512
00:45:42,691 --> 00:45:45,109
Maybe we can hold them
off for a day or two,

513
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:47,183
but we’ll never beat them.

514
00:45:48,113 --> 00:45:49,480
Where are we going?

515
00:45:49,531 --> 00:45:51,198
Going to find Mance.

516
00:45:51,232 --> 00:45:53,934
To fi–-
you can’t do that.

517
00:45:53,969 --> 00:45:55,819
<i>No one gave you any orders.</i>

518
00:45:57,572 --> 00:45:59,957
Who’s left to give orders?

519
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:02,743
The wildling army’s only
an army because of Mance.

520
00:46:02,745 --> 00:46:05,496
He united 100 warring tribes.

521
00:46:05,547 --> 00:46:07,581
Without Mance,
they lose their leader.

522
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:10,300
They lose their purpose. They
go back to fighting each other.

523
00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:12,136
Scatter back to their homes.

524
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,338
Without Mance?

525
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:15,806
You’re going to kill him?

526
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,141
I’m gonna try.

527
00:46:17,175 --> 00:46:19,009
They’ll never let you
within 100 yards of him.

528
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:21,261
And even if they did, even
if you managed to kill him–

529
00:46:21,263 --> 00:46:23,847
They’ll kill me? If I don’t
go, they’ll kill me anyway.

530
00:46:23,898 --> 00:46:25,315
They’ll kill
the rest of us, too.

531
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,901
Sam: – <i>They won’t just kill you.</i>

532
00:46:27,936 --> 00:46:29,770
They’ll boil you.
They’ll flay you.

533
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:31,321
They’ll make it last days.

534
00:46:34,109 --> 00:46:37,661
You’re right.
It’s a bad plan.

535
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:41,699
What’s your plan?

536
00:47:24,993 --> 00:47:27,161
They held the gate.

537
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:38,972
Get some brothers
down here to help you.

538
00:47:41,092 --> 00:47:43,393
We need to burn the bodies.

539
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:07,201
Raise the outer gate.

540
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:09,787
Then lower it again
as soon as I’m out.

541
00:48:21,216 --> 00:48:22,716
What are you doing?

542
00:48:22,718 --> 00:48:25,435
I promised Mormont
I’d never lose it again.

543
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:31,942
In case I don’t come back.

544
00:48:39,734 --> 00:48:41,785
Jon.

545
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:48,242
Come back.

546
00:48:57,218 --> 00:48:59,469
