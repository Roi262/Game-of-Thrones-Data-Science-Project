I need you to negotiate
with Renly Baratheon.

3

If Renly sides with us,
we'll outnumber them two to one.

I am glad your new friend was able
to accompany you to the capital.

5

secrets from my good friends.

you're transporting.

We're looking for
a boy named Gendry.

10

We'll be back with more men.

11
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:31,923
This is Gilly.
She's one of Craster's daughters.

12

We have to take her
with us when we leave.

13

I'm going to have a baby.
If it's a boy...

If it's a boy, what?

15
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:40,765
Seeing as you betrayed
the last Hand of the King,

16
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,635
well, I just wouldn't feel
safe with you lurking about.

17
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,603
- The queen herself--
- The queen regent.

18

she is your friend.

Yara?

- She can't lead an attack.

- Please.

My mother used it
for sewing.

84
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:42,024
She'd let me sit with her
in her chamber while she sewed

85
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:44,827

tasting blood in my mouth when

109
00:08:32,706 --> 00:08:35,574
howling.

110
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:39,744
Old Nan used to
tell me stories

00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:41,812
about magical people
who could live

112
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:46,550
inside stags,
birds, wolves.

113
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:48,552
That's exactly
what they are, Bran--

114
00:08:48,587 --> 00:08:51,121
- stories.
- So she was lying?

115
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,424
- They don't exist?
- Well, they may have done.

116
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,027

from the world

the same dream.

Only one Maester in 100

130
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:39,570
It signifies that I have
studied the higher mysteries.

131
00:09:39,605 --> 00:09:43,774
And all who study these mysteries
try their hand at spells.

132
00:09:43,808 --> 00:09:45,710
I was no different.

133
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:47,812

wish for hidden powers

00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:56,554

dull life into a special one?

136
00:09:56,588 --> 00:09:59,423
But in the end,
for all my efforts,

137
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:02,693

00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:35,339
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

179
00:13:36,508 --> 00:13:38,209
You are most kind.

180
00:13:38,243 --> 00:13:40,777
My Lady,

181
00:13:40,812 --> 00:13:43,446
I swear to you I will see
the Lannisters answer

182
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:45,682
for your husband's murder.

183
00:13:45,716 --> 00:13:48,117
When I take King's Landing,

184
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:50,185
I'll bring you
Joffrey's head.

185
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,853
( Cheering )

186
00:13:58,594 --> 00:14:02,063
It will be enough to know that
justice was done, My Lord.

187
00:14:02,098 --> 00:14:04,566
Brienne:
<i>Your Grace.</i>

188
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,969
And you should kneel
when you approach the King.

189
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:10,372
There's no need for that.
Lady Stark is an honored guest.

190
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:12,809
Has your son marched against
Tywin Lannister yet?

191
00:14:14,178 --> 00:14:16,847
I do not sit on
my son's war councils.

192
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:20,784
And if I did, I would not share his
strategies with you.

193
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,753
If Robb Stark wants a pact with us,
he should come himself,

194
00:14:23,788 --> 00:14:25,822
not hide behind
his mother's skirts.

195
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:28,858
My son is fighting a war,

196
00:14:28,892 --> 00:14:30,793
not playing at one.

197
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:32,695
( Men grumbling )

198
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,264
( Chuckles )

199
00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:45,974
Don't worry, My Lady.

200
00:14:46,008 --> 00:14:48,076
Our war is just beginning.

201
00:14:53,282 --> 00:14:56,317
( Men shouting )

202
00:15:01,224 --> 00:15:03,491
- Your Grace.
- Gerard.

203
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:06,160
- How's your foot?
- Better, Your Grace.

204
00:15:06,194 --> 00:15:08,495
They don't know
their own size is all.

205
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,664
Good man.

206
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:14,534
I have 100,000 men
at my command.

207
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:17,170
All the might of the Stormlands
and the Reach.

208
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:20,540
And all of them young and bold
like your Knight of Flowers?

209
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:24,278
It's a game to you,
isn't it?

210
00:15:24,312 --> 00:15:26,580
- I pity them.
- Why?

211
00:15:26,615 --> 00:15:28,482
Because it won't last.

212
00:15:28,517 --> 00:15:32,787
Because they are the Knights of summer
and winter is coming.

213
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:38,461
Brienne, escort
Lady Catelyn to her tent.

214
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,498
- She's tired from her journey.
- <i>At once, Your Grace.</i>

215
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:43,767
- Shall I return after?
- <i>That won't be necessary.</i>

216
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:47,137
I would pray awhile.
Alone.

217
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,440
If you'll follow me,
My Lady.

218
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:56,079
You fought bravely today,
Lady Brienne.

219
00:15:56,113 --> 00:15:58,481
I fought for my King.

220
00:15:58,515 --> 00:16:01,184
Soon I'll fight for him
on the battlefield.

221
00:16:01,218 --> 00:16:03,886
Die for him
if I must.

222
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,090
And, if it please you,
Brienne's enough.

223
00:16:08,124 --> 00:16:10,326
I'm no lady.

224
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:43,627
What are you doing here?

225
00:16:43,662 --> 00:16:45,863
I live here.

226
00:16:45,897 --> 00:16:50,001
- Are you angry with me, brother?
- You lying bitch.

227
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:53,037
It's not my fault
you didn't recognize me.

228
00:16:53,072 --> 00:16:56,307
Recognize you?
How could I?

229
00:16:56,341 --> 00:16:58,209
The last time I saw you...

230
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:01,746
You looked like
a fat little boy.

231
00:17:02,782 --> 00:17:05,416
You were a fat
little boy, too,

232
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,986
but I recognized you.

233
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:09,454
Why didn't you tell me?

234
00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:11,524
I wanted to see
who you were first.

235
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:13,559
( Laughs )
And I did.

236
00:17:15,763 --> 00:17:18,832
The plans are made.
It's time you heard them.

237
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:21,734
- Father.
- Father.

238
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,571
The wolf pup
has gone south

239
00:17:25,606 --> 00:17:29,141
with the entirety of the northern
army at his back.

240
00:17:29,176 --> 00:17:31,477
While he's tangling with
the lion in the Westerlands,

241
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:34,246
the north is ripe
for the taking.

242
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,883
The Ironborn will reave and
pillage as it was in the old days

243
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:39,918
all along the northern coast.

244
00:17:39,952 --> 00:17:42,989
We'll spread our dominion
across the green lands,

245
00:17:43,023 --> 00:17:45,892
<i>securing the Neck</i>
<i>and everything above.</i>

246
00:17:45,926 --> 00:17:48,829
Every stronghold will yield
to us one by one.

247
00:17:48,864 --> 00:17:51,532
Winterfell may defy us
for a year, but what of it?

248
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:53,568
The rest shall be ours--

249
00:17:53,602 --> 00:17:57,072
forest, field and hall.

250
00:18:00,911 --> 00:18:04,012
Yara, my daughter,
you'll take 30 longships

251
00:18:04,047 --> 00:18:05,915
<i>to attack Deepwood Motte.</i>

252
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:08,017
I've always wanted
a castle.

253
00:18:08,051 --> 00:18:10,719
And what's my role
in all this?

254
00:18:12,322 --> 00:18:15,858
You'll take a ship to raid the
fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.

255
00:18:15,892 --> 00:18:17,626
A ship?

256
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:19,695
You give her 30
and I get one?

257
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,232
The sea bitch. We thought
she'd be perfect for you.

258
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:26,836
I'm to fight fishermen?

259
00:18:26,871 --> 00:18:29,273
Be careful
of their nets.

260
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,615
Father, I fought with Robb Stark.
I know his men.

261
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,417
He won't give up
the North so easily.

262
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,252
They won't even know we're
there until it's too late.

263
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,586
What do you
know of it, woman?

264
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,355
I'm a proven warrior.

265
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:46,491
Your brothers were warriors,
both of them dead

266
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:50,161
at the hands of those
you seem so eager to protect.

267
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,664
I'm not protecting anyone.

268
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:55,966
I just wonder
if it's not wiser to wait.

269
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:59,703
Why risk going against the North
if they would be our allies?

270
00:18:59,737 --> 00:19:02,372
Rise up against them
and they could destroy us.

271
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,842
But if we pledge
fealty to them,

272
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,911
they'll give us
Casterly Rock.

273
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,949
What are our words?

274
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,817
Our words?

275
00:19:14,255 --> 00:19:17,024
- "We do not sow."
- "We do not sow."

276
00:19:17,058 --> 00:19:18,826
We are Ironborn.

277
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,695
We're not subjects.
We're not slaves.

278
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:24,832
We do not plow the fields
or toil in the mine.

279
00:19:24,866 --> 00:19:27,869
We take what is ours.

280
00:19:27,903 --> 00:19:31,406
Your time with the wolves
has made you weak.

281
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:38,079
You act as if
I volunteered to go.

282
00:19:38,114 --> 00:19:41,082
You gave me away,
if you remember.

283
00:19:41,116 --> 00:19:43,418
The day you bent the knee
to Robert Baratheon.

284
00:19:43,452 --> 00:19:45,720
After he crushed you.

285
00:19:45,754 --> 00:19:47,622
Did you take
what was yours then?

286
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,261
You gave me away!

287
00:19:54,363 --> 00:19:56,431
Your boy!

288
00:19:56,465 --> 00:19:58,834
Your last boy!

289
00:19:58,868 --> 00:20:02,637
You gave me away like I was some dog
you didn't want anymore.

290
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:06,041
And now you curse me
because I've come home.

291
00:20:15,952 --> 00:20:19,354
You'd have our father bow
down to your other family?

292
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:21,956
I have no other family.

293
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:24,025
Don't you?

294
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,562
Make your choice, Theon,
and do it quickly.

295
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:30,365
Our ships sail
with or without you.

296
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:44,178
You won't let me
leave this room.

297
00:20:44,213 --> 00:20:47,215
- You won't let me--
- Shh, shh, keep your voice down.

298
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:53,321
Why? You think your father
can hear me?

299
00:20:53,355 --> 00:20:55,990
He's 300 miles away!

300
00:20:56,024 --> 00:20:57,992
( Sighs )

301
00:20:58,027 --> 00:21:01,028
I don't intend for you
to stay here.

302
00:21:01,063 --> 00:21:03,965
I might be able to bring you into
the castle kitchens.

303
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:07,668
Again, only temporary.

304
00:21:07,702 --> 00:21:10,237
Every man who has
tasted my cooking

305
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:12,273
has told me what
a good whore I am.

306
00:21:12,307 --> 00:21:14,275
But you wouldn't
be a cook.

307
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:18,012
You'd pose
as a scullion.

308
00:21:18,047 --> 00:21:21,249
Scullion?
What is a scullion?

309
00:21:21,284 --> 00:21:23,952
Kitchen wench.

310
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:26,655
- A kitchen wench?
- Yes, but--

311
00:21:26,689 --> 00:21:28,183
Cleaning pots?

312
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,776
Is that how my lion
wants to see me?

313
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,595
Your lion wants
to see you alive.

314
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:36,064
We've come to
a dangerous place.

315
00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:37,899
My sister wants to hurt me.

316
00:21:37,934 --> 00:21:40,101
She'll look for any
weakness she can find.

317
00:21:40,135 --> 00:21:42,003
She can't know about you.

318
00:21:42,037 --> 00:21:44,138
I'm the weakness?

319
00:21:44,173 --> 00:21:45,639
It's a compliment,
My Lady.

320
00:21:45,674 --> 00:21:49,342
How is being a weakness
a compliment?

321
00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:54,114
Language can be
a bit tricky here.

322
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:57,984
Oh, I'm too stupid
to understand.

323
00:21:58,018 --> 00:22:00,386
The stupid foreign girl.

324
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:06,125
I am not
a kitchen wench.

325
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,351
When will Joffrey
and Sansa be married?

326
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,919
Soon, darling,
when the war is over.

327
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,855
Mother says I'll have
a new gown for the ceremony

328
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,325
and another for the feast.

329
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,428
But yours will be ivory
since you're the bride.

330
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,769
The Princess
just spoke to you.

331
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:52,872
Pardon, Your Grace.

332
00:22:55,242 --> 00:22:57,543
I'm sure your dress will
be beautiful, Myrcella.

333
00:22:57,577 --> 00:23:01,113
I'm counting the days
until the fighting is done

334
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:05,217
and I can pledge my love to
the King in sight of the Gods.

335
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,689
Is Joffrey going to kill
Sansa's brother?

336
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,293
He might.

337
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,363
Would you like that?

338
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:24,534
No.
I don't think so.

339
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:29,439
Even if he does,
Sansa will do her duty.

340
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:33,210
Won't you, little dove?

341
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:52,829
- <i>( Knocking )</i>
- ( Gasps ) Come in.

342
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:56,600
<i>( Door opens )</i>

343
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:58,001
Who are you?

344
00:23:58,035 --> 00:24:00,937
I'm Shae, My Lady.
Your new handmaiden.

345
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:04,374
I didn't know I needed
a new handmaiden.

346
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,779
- You're not from here.
- No.

347
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:16,422
What are you doing?

348
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,324
Waiting for you
to tell me what to do.

349
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:20,593
I shouldn't have to tell
you to do things.

350
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:22,863
You should just do them.

351
00:24:22,897 --> 00:24:25,065
What things?

352
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:27,167
Change my linens,
wash my clothing,

353
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:30,804
scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot,
brush my hair.

354
00:24:39,647 --> 00:24:41,481
- No.
- You said to brush--

355
00:24:41,516 --> 00:24:44,317
Not now.

356
00:24:45,887 --> 00:24:48,755
Your chamber pot
is empty.

357
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:51,058
Clean the table.

358
00:24:55,663 --> 00:24:58,465
Have you ever been
a handmaiden before?

359
00:24:58,499 --> 00:25:00,534
- Yes.
- For whom?

360
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:02,569
- Lady Zuriff.
- Lady Zuriff?

361
00:25:04,573 --> 00:25:06,473
Lady Zuriff.

362
00:25:06,508 --> 00:25:10,211
There is no Lady Zuriff
in this city.

363
00:25:10,245 --> 00:25:12,146
She wasn't in
this city.

364
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,582
Well, I don't know how
they did things in that city,

365
00:25:14,616 --> 00:25:17,551
but in this city,
handmaidens wait on ladies,

366
00:25:17,585 --> 00:25:19,120
not the other way around.

367
00:25:19,154 --> 00:25:22,056
And I don't have time
to answer 1,000 questions

368
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,558
and teach you
how to do your job.

369
00:25:27,729 --> 00:25:29,396
Do you want me to leave?

370
00:25:37,305 --> 00:25:39,340
Just brush my hair.

371
00:25:53,624 --> 00:25:56,226
Oh, thank the Gods.

372
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,495
I haven't had
a proper shit in six days.

373
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:02,032
I've encountered this
problem before, My Lord.

374
00:26:02,066 --> 00:26:05,569
The stresses of power
often have this

375
00:26:05,603 --> 00:26:07,404
insalubrious effect.

376
00:26:07,439 --> 00:26:10,573
Two drops
with water daily.

377
00:26:10,608 --> 00:26:12,475
Right. I'm so grateful
to have a man

378
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:15,211
of your vast knowledge
and wisdom on my side.

379
00:26:15,246 --> 00:26:18,114
- Please.
- Thank you, My Lord.

380
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,022
I can trust you,
Pycelle, can I not?

381
00:26:25,056 --> 00:26:26,857
Why, yes, of course,
My Lord.

382
00:26:26,892 --> 00:26:29,060
These are perilous times.

383
00:26:29,095 --> 00:26:31,062
And the crown must forge
new alliances.

384
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:36,202
And these alliances must often
be sealed in matrimony.

385
00:26:36,236 --> 00:26:38,738
Matrimony, huh?

386
00:26:38,772 --> 00:26:40,674
Yes.

387
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:42,909
I'm trusting the council
with these plans,

388
00:26:42,944 --> 00:26:44,678
but the queen mustn't know.

389
00:26:44,712 --> 00:26:47,280
We can't have her
meddling in affairs

390
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:48,660
that could determine
the future of the realm.

391
00:26:48,685 --> 00:26:49,885
There's too much at stake.

392
00:26:50,051 --> 00:26:53,019
Oh, yes, yes.
Indeed, yes.

393
00:26:53,054 --> 00:26:56,322
I shall be silent
as the grave.

394
00:26:56,357 --> 00:27:00,426
I'm brokering an alliance
with House Martell of Dorne.

395
00:27:00,461 --> 00:27:02,929
Princess Myrcella will wed
their youngest son

396
00:27:02,963 --> 00:27:05,899
when she comes of age,
ensuring their loyalty

397
00:27:05,934 --> 00:27:08,603
and their army
should we need it.

398
00:27:08,637 --> 00:27:12,608
Myrcella sent away
to Dorne?

399
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:17,681
But remember,
the queen mustn't know.

400
00:27:17,715 --> 00:27:20,984
Ooh, "the queen
mustn't know."

401
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:24,554
I love conversations
that begin this way.

402
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:27,824
I plan to marry
Princess Myrcella off

403
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:29,559
to Theon Greyjoy.

404
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:33,330
Theon Greyjoy?

405
00:27:33,364 --> 00:27:36,099
Forgive me, My Lord,?

406
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:39,002
He grew up a ward
of Winterfell.

407
00:27:39,037 --> 00:27:40,670
He fights
for Robb Stark.

408
00:27:40,704 --> 00:27:44,240
Precisely. Theon's father
loathes the Starks

409
00:27:44,274 --> 00:27:47,043
and will convince the boy
to come to our side.

410
00:27:47,111 --> 00:27:50,546
Greyjoy can destroy
the northern army from within

411
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:53,115
<i>and we can have</i>
<i>his father's ships.</i>

412
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,652
But remember,
you must tell no one.

413
00:27:56,687 --> 00:27:59,222
Tell no one what?

414
00:27:59,256 --> 00:28:03,226
I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to
Robin Arryn of the Vale.

415
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:08,097
Lysa is not fond of me.

416
00:28:08,132 --> 00:28:10,467
But perhaps the promise
of a royal match

417
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:13,736
will convince her
to let bygones be bygones.

418
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,705
She imprisoned you.

419
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:17,807
She tried
to execute you.

420
00:28:17,841 --> 00:28:20,776
And you offer
her son a princess?

421
00:28:20,811 --> 00:28:24,646
For men in our position,
holding grudges can be

422
00:28:24,681 --> 00:28:26,448
an encumbrance,
don't you think?

423
00:28:26,483 --> 00:28:30,853
And I suppose you want me
to broker this agreement?

424
00:28:30,887 --> 00:28:32,521
Who better?

425
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:39,127
Yes, I could sing
this song to Lysa,

426
00:28:39,161 --> 00:28:41,396
if I cared to.

427
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,632
What's in it
for me?

428
00:28:45,502 --> 00:28:47,771
The gratitude of
the people of Westeros

429
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:49,506
for helping to end
this war,

430
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:53,711
the adoration of the King for
bringing the Vale back into the fold...

431
00:28:55,514 --> 00:28:57,382
and Harrenhal.

432
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:59,817
Harrenhal is cursed.

433
00:28:59,852 --> 00:29:01,753
Never took you
for a superstitious man.

434
00:29:01,787 --> 00:29:03,687
By all means,
tear it down and rebuild.

435
00:29:03,722 --> 00:29:05,489
You'll be able
to afford it.

436
00:29:05,523 --> 00:29:08,325
I plan to make you
Lord of the Riverlands.

437
00:29:10,227 --> 00:29:11,966
With a single stroke,
you'd make me one of the

438
00:29:11,991 --> 00:29:13,029
greatest lords in the realm.

439
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:16,298
You served my family well
in the matter of the succession.

440
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:19,535
So did Janos Slynt, and he
was given Harrenhal, too.

441
00:29:19,569 --> 00:29:22,471
Until you snatched it away.

442
00:29:22,506 --> 00:29:24,807
I need you to
deliver Lysa Arryn.

443
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:27,577
I didn't need
Janos Slynt.

444
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:32,449
<i>It's settled, then?</i>

445
00:29:33,552 --> 00:29:35,185
Good.

446
00:29:37,422 --> 00:29:39,623
Oh, and remember--

447
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:41,492
the queen mustn't know.

448
00:29:53,272 --> 00:29:56,140
( Breathing heavily )

449
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:22,034
That must hurt.

450
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:24,336
( Groans )

451
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:34,280
What?

452
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:37,349
What is it?

453
00:30:37,384 --> 00:30:39,385
( Scoffs )

454
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:42,288
A member of the Kingsguard?

455
00:30:42,322 --> 00:30:45,158
As if I wasn't humiliated
enough already.

456
00:30:45,192 --> 00:30:47,427
( Sighs )

457
00:30:47,461 --> 00:30:51,698
Brienne is a very
capable warrior.

458
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,268
And she's devoted to me.

459
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,506
You're jealous.

460
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,442
Jealous?

461
00:31:01,476 --> 00:31:03,644
Of Brienne the beauty?

462
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:05,745
Don't make me laugh.

463
00:31:07,382 --> 00:31:11,117
- I'll make it up to you.
- No, Your Grace.

464
00:31:12,253 --> 00:31:14,454
Not tonight.

465
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:17,123
There's another Tyrell
who requires your attention.

466
00:31:17,158 --> 00:31:18,858
You didn't win
my father's support

467
00:31:18,893 --> 00:31:21,027
or his army
on charm alone.

468
00:31:34,675 --> 00:31:38,444
Your vassals are starting
to snigger behind your back.

469
00:31:38,478 --> 00:31:41,447
Brides aren't usually virgins
two weeks after their wedding night.

470
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,350
And Margaery's a virgin?

471
00:31:43,384 --> 00:31:45,586
Officially.

472
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:48,956
Shall I bring her
to you?

473
00:32:15,755 --> 00:32:17,656
I should warn you,

474
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,624
I've had quite
a bit of wine.

475
00:32:19,659 --> 00:32:22,194
As is your right.
You are a King.

476
00:32:24,098 --> 00:32:26,266
You look
very beautiful.

477
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,167
Thank you,
Your Grace.

478
00:32:28,202 --> 00:32:32,139
- It's a lovely gown.
- <i>You think so?</i>

479
00:32:32,173 --> 00:32:34,909
I can't decide
how I like it better.

480
00:32:34,944 --> 00:32:37,045
This way...

481
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:40,082
or this way.

482
00:32:46,223 --> 00:32:47,856
You certainly don't need it.

483
00:32:49,492 --> 00:32:50,960
Although...

484
00:32:50,994 --> 00:32:54,597
some say that
beauty most desired

485
00:32:54,631 --> 00:32:56,399
is the beauty concealed.

486
00:33:12,851 --> 00:33:15,086
Must be the wine.

487
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,688
Here, let me.

488
00:33:33,104 --> 00:33:35,672
( Shudders )

489
00:33:37,675 --> 00:33:39,643
I'm sorry.

490
00:33:39,677 --> 00:33:41,845
Do you want my brother
to come in and help?

491
00:33:44,849 --> 00:33:47,251
- What?
- He could get you started.

492
00:33:47,285 --> 00:33:48,617
I know he wouldn't mind.

493
00:33:48,642 --> 00:33:51,221
Or I can turn over and you
can pretend I'm him.

494
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:56,027
I don't know what
you're talking about.

495
00:34:01,201 --> 00:34:04,003
There's no need
for us to play games.

496
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:07,240
Save your lies for court.
You're going to need a lot of them.

497
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,761
Your enemies
aren't happy about us.

498
00:34:28,796 --> 00:34:31,130
They want to tear
us apart.

499
00:34:31,165 --> 00:34:34,233
And the best way
to stop them

500
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:37,570
is to put your baby

501
00:34:37,604 --> 00:34:40,072
in my belly.

502
00:34:42,975 --> 00:34:45,478
We can try again later.

503
00:34:45,512 --> 00:34:47,380
You decide how
you want to do it--

504
00:34:47,414 --> 00:34:49,282
with me,
with me and Loras.

505
00:34:49,316 --> 00:34:51,785
However else you like.

506
00:34:54,156 --> 00:34:56,857
Whatever you need to do.

507
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:02,163
You are a King.

508
00:35:10,473 --> 00:35:12,740
Cersei:
<i>You monster.</i>

509
00:35:12,774 --> 00:35:15,109
Myrcella is my only daughter.

510
00:35:15,144 --> 00:35:17,812
Do you really think I'll let you
sell her like a common whore?

511
00:35:17,846 --> 00:35:19,380
Myrcella's a Princess.

512
00:35:19,414 --> 00:35:21,048
Some would say
she was born for this.

513
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:22,750
I will not let you
ship her off to Dorne

514
00:35:22,818 --> 00:35:24,919
as I was shipped off
to Robert Baratheon.

515
00:35:24,953 --> 00:35:27,254
Dorne is the safest place
or her.

516
00:35:27,288 --> 00:35:30,691
Are you mad?
The Martells loathe us.

517
00:35:30,725 --> 00:35:33,160
That's why we need
to seduce them.

518
00:35:33,194 --> 00:35:35,028
We're going to need
their support in the war

519
00:35:35,063 --> 00:35:36,930
your son started.

520
00:35:36,965 --> 00:35:39,199
- She'll be a hostage.
- A guest.

521
00:35:39,234 --> 00:35:41,836
You won't get away
with this.

522
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:45,806
You think the piece of paper father
gave you keeps you safe.

523
00:35:48,443 --> 00:35:51,312
Ned Stark had a piece
of paper, too.

524
00:35:52,914 --> 00:35:55,682
- It's done, Cersei.
- No.

525
00:35:55,717 --> 00:35:59,920
- You cannot stop it.
- No!

526
00:36:02,123 --> 00:36:05,391
<i>Just how safe do you think</i>
<i>Myrcella is if this city falls?</i>

527
00:36:05,425 --> 00:36:09,261
Do you want to see her raped,
butchered like the Targaryen children?

528
00:36:09,295 --> 00:36:11,530
Make no mistake.

529
00:36:11,564 --> 00:36:14,166
They'll mount her pretty little head
on a spike right beside yours.

530
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,501
Get out!
Get out!

531
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:20,931
Theon of
the House Greyjoy,

532
00:37:20,966 --> 00:37:24,602
you would this day consecrate
your faith to the drowned God?

533
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:35,415
- I would.
- <i>Kneel.</i>

534
00:37:38,786 --> 00:37:40,153
Let Theon,
your servant,

535
00:37:40,188 --> 00:37:43,357
be born again from
the sea as you were.

536
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:46,126
Bless him with salt.

537
00:37:48,463 --> 00:37:51,298
Bless him with stone.

538
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:53,100
Bless him with steel.

539
00:37:58,307 --> 00:38:00,408
What is dead
may never die.

540
00:38:00,442 --> 00:38:02,544
What is dead
may never die...

541
00:38:04,013 --> 00:38:07,682
But rises again
harder and stronger.

542
00:38:07,717 --> 00:38:09,818
Stand.

543
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,843
<i>( Dog barking )</i>

544
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:38,583
<i>( Footsteps approaching )</i>

545
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:43,187
I don't appreciate being
made a fool of, dwarf.

546
00:38:43,222 --> 00:38:44,722
If Myrcella marries
the Martell boy,

547
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,990
she can't very well
marry Robin Arryn, can she?

548
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:50,160
No, afraid not.
Sorry about that.

549
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:51,995
And Harrenhal--

550
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:55,098
I suppose that's
off the table as well.

551
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:58,835
Yes, I fear so.
Sorry about that, too.

552
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:01,036
Leave me out of your
next deception.

553
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:03,072
Oh, that's a shame.

554
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:06,408
You were to be the centerpiece of
my next deception.

555
00:39:06,443 --> 00:39:09,712
My brother Jaime rots
in a Northern stockade.

556
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,948
I would see him released.

557
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,449
That's where you come in.

558
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,952
Robb Stark will never
release the Kingslayer.

559
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:19,623
No, he won't.
But his mother might.

560
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:22,560
How would you like to see
your beloved Cat again?

561
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:25,096
<i>( Footsteps approaching )</i>

562
00:39:26,165 --> 00:39:28,266
- Find him?
- Oh, aye.

563
00:39:28,301 --> 00:39:30,235
And he has company.

564
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:34,640
Filthy old stoat.
Almost hate to interrupt.

565
00:39:34,675 --> 00:39:38,044
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't.

566
00:39:42,283 --> 00:39:44,918
- ( Door bursts )
- ( Gasps )

567
00:39:44,952 --> 00:39:47,654
What is the meaning
of this?

568
00:39:47,689 --> 00:39:49,690
No, please, please.

569
00:39:49,724 --> 00:39:52,125
You disappoint me,
Grand Maester.

570
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:54,895
I am your loyal servant.

571
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:56,731
So loyal that you told
the Queen about my plans

572
00:39:56,756 --> 00:39:58,361
to send Myrcella to Dorne.

573
00:39:58,399 --> 00:40:00,166
No! Never!

574
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:02,836
It's a falsehood.
I swear it.

575
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,338
It wasn't me.

576
00:40:04,372 --> 00:40:06,073
Ah, Varys.

577
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:09,209
It was Varys
the spider.

578
00:40:09,244 --> 00:40:13,380
See, I told Varys that I was giving
the Princess to the Greyjoys.

579
00:40:13,414 --> 00:40:17,951
I told Littlefinger that I planned
to wed her to Robin Arryn.

580
00:40:17,985 --> 00:40:21,422
I told no one that I was
offering her to the Dornish.

581
00:40:22,357 --> 00:40:24,024
No one but you.

582
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:26,593
The eunuch has
spies everywhere.

583
00:40:26,628 --> 00:40:29,029
Cut off his manhood
and feed it to the goats.

584
00:40:29,063 --> 00:40:31,498
- No, no, no.
- There are no goats, halfman.

585
00:40:31,532 --> 00:40:33,567
Well, make do.

586
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:35,636
( Whimpering )

587
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,972
How long have you
been spying for my sister?

588
00:40:38,006 --> 00:40:40,608
All I did, I did
for House Lannister.

589
00:40:40,642 --> 00:40:43,110
<i>Always. Your lord father,</i>
<i>ask him.</i>

590
00:40:43,145 --> 00:40:44,945
I've always been
his servant

591
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,881
since the days
of the Mad King.

592
00:40:48,451 --> 00:40:51,520
- I don't like his beard.
- What?

593
00:40:51,555 --> 00:40:53,356
What?
Oh, no. No.

594
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:56,459
( Whimpering )

595
00:40:56,494 --> 00:40:59,663
How many hands have you
betrayed, Pycelle?

596
00:40:59,697 --> 00:41:02,132
Eddard Stark?
Jon Arryn?

597
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:03,900
Lord Arryn,
he knew.

598
00:41:03,935 --> 00:41:06,870
( Stammering ) He knew the truth
about the queen.

599
00:41:06,904 --> 00:41:10,506
And, well,
he planned to act,

600
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:12,375
to tell King Robert.

601
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:13,709
So you poisoned him?

602
00:41:13,744 --> 00:41:16,111
No. Never.

603
00:41:16,146 --> 00:41:18,980
But you let him die,
made sure he succumbed.

604
00:41:19,015 --> 00:41:21,549
Lannister--
I always served Lannister.

605
00:41:21,584 --> 00:41:24,251
Get him out of my sight.
Throw him in one of the black cells.

606
00:41:24,286 --> 00:41:26,153
Oh, no. No, no, no.
No, please.

607
00:41:26,188 --> 00:41:28,355
<i>Don't!</i>
<i>You can't do this to me!</i>

608
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:31,158
For your trouble.

609
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:34,060
<i>( Pycelle shouting )</i>

610
00:41:55,448 --> 00:41:58,050
You'll be pleased to know
our mutual friend

611
00:41:58,084 --> 00:42:01,486
<i>is doing quite well</i>
<i>in Lady Sansa's service.</i>

612
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,889
Good.
One of my better ideas.

613
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:07,258
And it seems
the Grand Maester

614
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:09,727
has found his way
into a black cell.

615
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:14,197
Well played,
My Lord Hand.

616
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:17,633
But should I be worried?

617
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:19,635
Janos Slynt,
Pycelle--

618
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,972
the small council
grows smaller every day.

619
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:25,875
The council has a reputation
for serving past Hands poorly.

620
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:29,045
I don't mean to follow
Ned Stark to the grave.

621
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,449
Power is a curious thing,
My Lord.

622
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,618
Are you fond of riddles?

623
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:37,620
Why, am I about
to hear one?

624
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:40,089
Three great men
sit in a room.

625
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,726
A king, a priest
and a rich man.

626
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,529
Between them stands
a common Sellsword.

627
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:49,500
<i>Each great man bids the</i>
<i>Sellsword kill the other two.</i>

628
00:42:49,535 --> 00:42:52,303
Who lives, who dies?

629
00:42:52,338 --> 00:42:54,573
Depends on the Sellsword.

630
00:42:54,607 --> 00:42:56,742
Does it?
He has neither crown

631
00:42:56,776 --> 00:42:59,011
nor gold nor favor
with the Gods.

632
00:42:59,045 --> 00:43:01,280
He has a sword,
the power of life and death.

633
00:43:01,314 --> 00:43:03,449
But if it's swordsmen
who rule,

634
00:43:03,483 --> 00:43:05,985
why do we pretend
Kings hold all the power?

635
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:08,754
<i>When Ned Stark</i>
<i>lost his head,</i>

636
00:43:08,788 --> 00:43:11,590
<i>who was truly responsible?</i>

637
00:43:11,624 --> 00:43:13,959
Joffrey?
The executioner?

638
00:43:13,993 --> 00:43:15,560
Or something else?

639
00:43:15,595 --> 00:43:17,929
I've decided
I don't like riddles.

640
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:25,170
Power resides where
men believe it resides.

641
00:43:25,205 --> 00:43:27,072
It's a trick,

642
00:43:27,106 --> 00:43:29,842
a shadow on the wall.

643
00:43:29,876 --> 00:43:33,713
And a very small man

644
00:43:33,747 --> 00:43:36,282
can cast a very large shadow.

645
00:43:41,221 --> 00:43:44,256
<i>( Crickets chirping )</i>

646
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:46,992
<i>( Horse whinnies )</i>

647
00:43:47,027 --> 00:43:49,828
( Snoring )

648
00:43:58,203 --> 00:44:01,172
<i>( Door opens )</i>

649
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:18,792
You should be sleeping.

650
00:44:18,826 --> 00:44:22,094
Tomorrow's a long march.

651
00:44:22,129 --> 00:44:25,097
30 miles if it
don't piss on us.

652
00:44:26,399 --> 00:44:28,033
I can't sleep.

653
00:44:32,672 --> 00:44:34,572
I don't like the taste.

654
00:44:34,606 --> 00:44:36,974
( Chuckles )

655
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:40,244
Well...

656
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:43,981
You don't drink it
for the flavor, to be honest.

657
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:53,089
What?

658
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:56,692
How do you sleep?

659
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:58,928
Same as most men,
I think.

660
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:01,630
But you've seen things,

661
00:45:01,664 --> 00:45:04,934
horrible things.

662
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:07,604
Aye.

663
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:10,640
I've seen some
pretty things, too,

664
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:12,910
but not nearly so many.

665
00:45:12,944 --> 00:45:16,348
How do you sleep
when you--

666
00:45:18,551 --> 00:45:22,888
when you have those
things in your head?

667
00:45:24,691 --> 00:45:27,660
You didn't see that.

668
00:45:27,694 --> 00:45:29,262
I made damn sure.

669
00:45:29,296 --> 00:45:31,531
I close my eyes
and I see them up there.

670
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,302
All of them

671
00:45:35,336 --> 00:45:37,938
standing there--

672
00:45:37,973 --> 00:45:40,540
Joffrey,

673
00:45:40,575 --> 00:45:43,143
the Queen,

674
00:45:43,178 --> 00:45:45,545
and--

675
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,981
and my sister.

676
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:00,893
You know, we've got something
in common, me and you.

677
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:03,262
You know that?

678
00:46:03,296 --> 00:46:05,832
I must have been

679
00:46:05,866 --> 00:46:08,335
a couple of years
older than you.

680
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:12,640
I saw my brother stabbed
through the heart

681
00:46:12,675 --> 00:46:14,709
<i>right on our doorstep.</i>

682
00:46:14,743 --> 00:46:18,279
<i>He weren't much of a villain</i>
<i>what skewered him.</i>

683
00:46:18,314 --> 00:46:20,915
<i>Willem, the lad's name was.</i>

684
00:46:22,885 --> 00:46:25,787
He ran off before
anyone could spit.

685
00:46:25,822 --> 00:46:29,024
And I just stood there,

686
00:46:29,058 --> 00:46:31,727
watching my brother die.

687
00:46:32,995 --> 00:46:36,031
<i>But here's the funny part.</i>

688
00:46:36,065 --> 00:46:39,268
I can't picture
my brother's face anymore.

689
00:46:39,302 --> 00:46:41,937
<i>But Willem--</i>

690
00:46:41,972 --> 00:46:44,941
oh, he was
a nice-looking boy.

691
00:46:46,377 --> 00:46:48,744
He had good white teeth,

692
00:46:48,779 --> 00:46:51,081
blue eyes,

693
00:46:51,115 --> 00:46:54,851
<i>one of those dimpled chins</i>
<i>all the girls like.</i>

694
00:46:57,055 --> 00:47:00,090
<i>I would think about him</i>
<i>when I was working,</i>

695
00:47:00,124 --> 00:47:04,194
when I was drinking,
when I was having a shit.

696
00:47:04,228 --> 00:47:06,496
It got to the point

697
00:47:06,531 --> 00:47:09,766
where I would say his name
every night before I went to bed.

698
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,301
Willem. Willem.

699
00:47:12,336 --> 00:47:15,071
<i>Willem.</i>

700
00:47:15,105 --> 00:47:17,273
A prayer almost.

701
00:47:19,042 --> 00:47:21,710
<i>Well, one day...</i>

702
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:26,782
<i>Willem came riding</i>
<i>back into town.</i>

703
00:47:29,151 --> 00:47:32,988
I buried an ax so deep
into Willem's skull,

704
00:47:33,022 --> 00:47:36,825
<i>they had to bury</i>
<i>him with it.</i>

705
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:40,162
Willem's horse
got me to the Wall

706
00:47:40,196 --> 00:47:42,964
and I've been wearing
black ever since.

707
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:48,972
Well...

708
00:47:49,006 --> 00:47:51,975
that'll help you sleep, eh?

709
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,646
<i>( Horn sounds )</i>

710
00:47:55,681 --> 00:47:58,115
<i>( Men shouting )</i>

711
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:59,417
Ho!

712
00:47:59,451 --> 00:48:02,620
Get up, you lazy
sons of whores!

713
00:48:02,654 --> 00:48:05,523
Arm yourselves.

714
00:48:05,557 --> 00:48:07,191
- Gendry: Get up.
- Arya: Get up.

715
00:48:07,226 --> 00:48:09,093
Keep out of sight,
both of you.

716
00:48:09,127 --> 00:48:10,661
- No, I'm not afraid.
- I can fight.

717
00:48:10,695 --> 00:48:12,930
Keep out of sight.

718
00:48:12,964 --> 00:48:15,532
If things go wrong,
you run.

719
00:48:15,566 --> 00:48:16,795
Do you hear me?

720
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,502
You run along North
and don't look back.

721
00:48:19,737 --> 00:48:22,272
Hey, there's men
out there

722
00:48:22,306 --> 00:48:24,542
who want to fuck
your corpses.

723
00:48:24,576 --> 00:48:27,244
Outside, now!

724
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,515
Man:
<i>Come on, move, move!</i>

725
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:32,317
<i>( Horse whinnies )</i>

726
00:48:32,351 --> 00:48:33,986
Gold Cloaks!

727
00:48:36,656 --> 00:48:39,893
( Shouting )

728
00:48:39,927 --> 00:48:41,828
Everyone out!

729
00:48:41,863 --> 00:48:45,599
( Shouting )

730
00:48:45,633 --> 00:48:49,469
Hey, you!
Open the damn cage!

731
00:48:53,008 --> 00:48:54,809
Where's the bastard, Crow?

732
00:48:54,843 --> 00:48:57,613
Got more than a few bastards here.
Who's asking?

733
00:48:57,647 --> 00:49:00,382
Ser Amory Lorch, sworn Bannerman
to Lord Tywin Lannister.

734
00:49:00,417 --> 00:49:04,586
<i>These men from the capital</i>
<i>requested our assistance.</i>

735
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,487
Drop your weapons
in the name of the King.

736
00:49:06,522 --> 00:49:08,556
Now, which King
would that be?

737
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:10,491
This is your last chance.

738
00:49:10,525 --> 00:49:13,226
In the name
of King Joffrey,

739
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,495
drop your weapons.

740
00:49:17,264 --> 00:49:20,966
( Spits )
I don't think I will.

741
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,168
So be it.

742
00:49:23,203 --> 00:49:25,838
( Grunts )

743
00:49:25,872 --> 00:49:29,408
I always hated crossbows.
Take too long to load.

744
00:49:46,527 --> 00:49:48,495
( Groans )

745
00:49:54,636 --> 00:49:57,238
( Gurgles )

746
00:50:07,216 --> 00:50:09,350
Jaqen: Boy, come here.
Boy!

747
00:50:09,384 --> 00:50:12,920
- Sweet boy, help us.
- Come back here!

748
00:50:12,954 --> 00:50:14,221
Help us, boy!

749
00:50:14,255 --> 00:50:16,790
( Shouting )

750
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:20,794
A man can fight!
Free us!

751
00:50:27,268 --> 00:50:29,770
Quick, give it to me.

752
00:50:31,406 --> 00:50:33,974
Give me the ax.
Give me that.

753
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:43,983
Soldier:
<i>Put 'em on the wagon!</i>

754
00:50:44,018 --> 00:50:45,985
<i>There's more here.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

755
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:49,055
( Grunts )

756
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:51,223
( Chuckles )

757
00:50:51,258 --> 00:50:54,760
What do we have here?

758
00:50:54,794 --> 00:50:56,761
No!

759
00:50:56,796 --> 00:51:00,231
That's a fine
little blade.

760
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:02,667
Maybe I'll pick
my teeth with it.

761
00:51:02,701 --> 00:51:04,502
I yield!
I yield!

762
00:51:04,537 --> 00:51:06,772
Amory:
<i>Round up any survivors.</i>

763
00:51:06,806 --> 00:51:08,874
We'll take them back
to Harrenhal.

764
00:51:08,908 --> 00:51:12,045
You heard him.
You're coming with us.

765
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:14,581
I yield!

766
00:51:16,651 --> 00:51:18,919
( Whimpering )

767
00:51:18,953 --> 00:51:20,955
Help!

768
00:51:20,989 --> 00:51:23,091
Help me!

769
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:28,329
Something wrong
with your leg, boy?

770
00:51:28,364 --> 00:51:30,365
Look at it.

771
00:51:38,207 --> 00:51:39,841
Can you walk?

772
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:42,610
No.
You got to carry me.

773
00:51:43,646 --> 00:51:45,814
All right.

774
00:51:53,322 --> 00:51:55,857
( Coughing )

775
00:51:59,129 --> 00:52:01,664
Carry him, he says.
( Laughs )

776
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,641
We're looking for
a bastard named Gendry.

777
00:52:12,676 --> 00:52:15,678
<i>Give him up</i>

778
00:52:15,712 --> 00:52:17,980
or I'll start
taking eyeballs.

779
00:52:30,394 --> 00:52:32,061
You want Gendry?

780
00:52:35,499 --> 00:52:37,800
You already got him.

781
00:52:41,971 --> 00:52:44,473
<i>He loved that helmet.</i>

782
00:52:55,216 --> 00:52:58,918
