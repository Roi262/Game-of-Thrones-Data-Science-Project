376
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:50,652
The stallion who mounts the world has no need for iron chairs.

377
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:52,321
According to the prophecy...

378
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:54,865
...the stallion will ride to the ends of the earth.

379
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:57,534
The earth ends at the black salt sea.

380
00:26:57,701 --> 00:26:59,578
No horse can cross the poison water.

381
00:26:59,745 --> 00:27:01,830
The earth does not end at the sea...

382
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:04,291
...there are many dirts beyond the sea.

383
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:06,710
The dirts of my birth. [[The dirt where l was born.]]

384
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:12,341
Not dirts. Lands.

385
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:14,760
Lands, yes...

386
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:18,639
There are thousands of ships in the free cities.

387
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:20,724
Wooden horses that fly across the sea...

388
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:24,520
Let's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.

389
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:26,355
lt's not a chair. It's a...

392
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:39,660
A chair for a King to sit upon,

393
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:41,411
Or...

394
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:43,205
...a Queen.

396
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:54,091
A khal does not need a chair to sit upon.

397
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:57,010
He only needs a steed.

423
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:43,700
Sweet reds. I have it. I have it. 

424
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:48,163
Sweet reds...

425
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:54,878
l have sweet reds from Lys, Volantis and the Arbor!

426
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:57,714
Tyroshi pear brandy! Andalish sours!

427
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,217
l have them! l have them!

428
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:02,803
A taste for the Khaleesi?

429
00:30:03,512 --> 00:30:05,806
l have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady.

430
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:09,685
One taste and you'll name your first child after me.

449
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:04,198
Put down that cask.

734
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:30,512
Moon of my life.

735
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:32,598
Are you hurt?

736
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:45,027
Jorah the Andal,

737
00:49:45,152 --> 00:49:47,905
l heard what you did.

738
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:51,575
Choose any horse you wish, it is yours.

739
00:49:55,662 --> 00:49:59,750
l make this gift to you for what you did.

740
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:09,968
And to my son, the stallion who will mount the world,

741
00:50:10,093 --> 00:50:13,555
l will also pledge a gift.

742
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:17,851
l will give him the iron chair...

743
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:21,980
...that his mother's father sat upon.

744
00:50:22,814 --> 00:50:25,817
I will give The Lands of the Andals. [[l will give him Seven Kingdoms.]]

745
00:50:27,402 --> 00:50:31,949
l, Drogo, will do this.

746
00:50:32,491 --> 00:50:35,827
l will take my Khalasar west to where the world ends...

747
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:41,416
...and ride wooden horses across the black salt water...

748
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:45,045
- ...as no Khal has done before.

749
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:51,760
l will kill the men in iron suits...

750
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:54,888
- ...and tear down their stone houses.

751
00:50:57,266 --> 00:51:01,061
- l will rape their women...

752
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:03,689
...take their children as slaves...

753
00:51:03,814 --> 00:51:06,942
...and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak.

755
00:51:10,863 --> 00:51:12,906
This, l vow...

756
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:15,951
...l, Drogo, son of Bharbo.

758
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:22,332
l swear before the Mother of Mountains...

759
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:24,293
...as the stars look down in witness.

760
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:28,922
As the stars look down in witness.
