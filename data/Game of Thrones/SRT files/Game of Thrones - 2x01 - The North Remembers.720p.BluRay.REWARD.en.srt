1
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,134
Well struck.

2
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,886
Well struck, dog.

3
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:22,725
Did you like that?

4
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,685
It was well struck, Your Grace.

5
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,230
I already said it was well struck.

6
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,191
Yes, Your Grace.

7
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,201
- Who's next?
Lothor Brune,

8
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,496
freerider in the service of Lord Baelish.

9
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,749
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.

10
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,463
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!

11
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:53,965
Here I am.

12
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,050
Here I am.

13
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,891
Sorry, Your Grace.

14
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,686
My deepest apologies.

15
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,396
Are you drunk?
- No.

16
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,190
No. No, Your Grace.

17
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:13,860
- I had two cups of wine.
- Two cups?

18
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,862
That's not much at all.

19
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,573
Please, have another cup.

20
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,116
Are you sure, Your Grace?

21
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,493
Yes. To celebrate my name day.

22
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,996
Have two. Have as much as you like.

23
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,915
I would be honored, Your Grace.

24
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:32,628
Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos
celebrate my name day.

25
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,755
See that he drinks his fill.

26
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,901
You can't.

27
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,111
What did you say?

28
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,239
Did you say I can't?

29
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,908
I only meant

30
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,869
it would be bad luck
to kill a man on your name day.

31
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,121
What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...

32
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,040
The girl is right.

33
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,418
What a man sows on his name day,
he reaps all year.

34
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,381
Take him away.

35
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,508
I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool.

36
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,140
He is a fool. You're so clever to see it.

37
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,393
He'll make a much better fool than a knight.

38
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,480
He doesn't deserve
the mercy of a quick death.

39
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,984
Did you hear my lady, Ser Dontos?

40
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,112
From this day, you'll be my new fool.

41
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,406
Thank you, Your Grace.

42
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,618
And you, my lady, thank you.

43
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,370
Beloved nephew.

44
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,421
We looked for you on the battlefield.

45
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,051
You were nowhere to be found.

46
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,638
I've been here, ruling the kingdoms.

47
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,391
What a fine job you've done.

48
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:10,559
Look at you.

49
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:14,188
More beautiful than ever.

50
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,982
And you!

51
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,317
You're going to be bigger than the Hound,

52
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,820
but much better looking.

53
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,822
This one doesn't like me.

54
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,740
Can't imagine why.

55
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,326
- We heard you were dead.
- I'm glad you're not dead.

56
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,997
Me, too, dear. Death is so boring,

57
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,375
especially now,
with so much excitement in the world.

58
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,711
My lady, I'm sorry for your loss.

59
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,839
Her loss?

60
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,841
Her father was a confessed traitor.

61
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,509
But still her father.

62
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,262
Surely, having so recently lost your own
beloved father, you can sympathize.

63
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,436
My father was a traitor.

64
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,396
My mother and brother are traitors, too.

65
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,982
I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.

66
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,944
Of course you are.

67
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,825
Well, enjoy your name day, Your Grace.

68
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,577
Wish I could stay and celebrate,

69
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,455
but there is work to be done.

70
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,540
What work?

71
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,584
Why are you here?

72
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:24,675
A raven arrived from the citadel
this morning, Your Grace.

73
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,595
The conclave has met,

74
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:31,140
considered reports from maesters
all over the Seven Kingdoms,

75
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,351
and declared this great summer

76
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,271
done at last.

77
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,149
The longest summer in living memory.

78
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,778
The peasants say, a long summer means
an even longer winter.

79
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,613
A common superstition.

80
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,074
We have enough wheat for a five-year winter.

81
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,493
If it lasts any longer,

82
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,037
we'll have fewer peasants.

83
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,499
The city's drowning in refugees,
Your Grace, fleeing the war.

84
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,627
We have nowhere to house them.
And with winter coming, it'll only get worse.

85
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:03,005
You command the city watch,
do you not, Lord Slynt?

86
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,092
I do, Your Grace.

87
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,177
And are you not a lord at my command?

88
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,847
I owe my title and lands
to your generosity, Your Grace.

89
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,433
Then do your job.
Shut the gates to the peasants.

90
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:17,436
They belong in the field, not our capital.

91
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,105
Yes, Your Grace.

92
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,904
Don't get up.

93
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,951
More ravishing than ever, big sister.

94
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,913
War agrees with you.

95
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,541
Forgive the interruption. Carry on.

96
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,502
What are you doing here?

97
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,214
It's been a remarkable journey.

98
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,884
I pissed off the edge of the Wall,

99
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,804
I slept in a sky cell,

100
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,056
I fought with the hill tribes.

101
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,683
So many adventures,

102
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,520
so much to be thankful for.

103
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:03,482
What are you doing here?
This is the small council.

104
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:08,320
Yes, well, I do believe the Hand of the King
is welcome at all small council meetings.

105
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,114
Our father is Hand of the King.

106
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,200
Yes, but in his absence...

107
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,877
Your father has named Lord Tyrion

108
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,504
to serve as hand in his stead while he fights.

109
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,007
Out! All of you out!

110
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,556
I would like to know
how you tricked Father into this.

111
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,185
If I were capable of tricking Father,
I'd be emperor of the world by now.

112
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,812
You brought this on yourself.

113
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,314
I've done nothing.

114
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,191
Quite right, you did nothing

115
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,526
when your son called for Ned Stark's head.

116
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,528
Now the entire North has risen up against us.

117
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,031
- I tried to stop it.
- Did you? You failed.

118
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,326
That bit of theater
will haunt our family for a generation.

119
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,288
- Robb Stark is a child.
- Who's won every battle he's fought.

120
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,707
Do you understand we're losing the war?

121
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,877
- What do you know about warfare?
- Nothing.

122
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,712
But I know people.

123
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:11,467
And I know that our enemies hate each other
almost as much as they hate us.

124
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,724
- Joffrey is king.
- Joffrey is king.

125
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,143
You are here to advise him.

126
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,895
I'm only here to advise him.

127
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,481
And if the king listens to what I say,

128
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,068
the king might just get his Uncle Jaime back.

129
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,321
How?

130
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,948
You love your children.

131
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,076
It's your one redeeming quality.
That and your cheekbones.

132
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,413
The Starks love their children as well.

133
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,707
- And we have two of them.
- One.

134
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,420
- One?
- Arya, little animal, she disappeared.

135
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,507
Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke?

136
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,553
We had three Starks to trade.

137
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,265
You chopped one's head off
and let another escape.

138
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,351
Father will be furious.

139
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,979
It must be odd for you

140
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,942
to be the disappointing child.

141
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,245
My lord, may the old gods
watch over your brother

142
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,956
and all our Northern sons.

143
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,876
The walls of my holdfast
will not stand the winter.

144
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:32,089
The stones were last mortared
in the time of King Aerys,

145
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:36,760
and I'm afraid the masons today
are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers.

146
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,596
When I was a boy,

147
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:45,060
I remember seeing them put up a new tower
at Torrhen's Square in a summer.

148
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,104
Men worked back then.

149
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:52,484
Today, my holdfast looks like it was built
by drunk children.

150
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:56,655
At night you can hear the wind
howling through the gaps.

151
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,991
Gods forbid it rains.

152
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,910
Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.

153
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:06,915
Maintenance of a holdfast generally falls
to the lord of that holdfast.

154
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,500
Generally, yes,

155
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,004
but I've sent all the young men off
to fight Robb Stark's war.

156
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,215
King Robb. And it's not his war.

157
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,176
He didn't choose it.

158
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,763
Maybe not, my lord,
but he called in his banners and took the men.

159
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,514
Joffrey killed my father,

160
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,017
your liege lord.

161
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,478
Do you remember your vows, ser?

162
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,396
Of course I remember!

163
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,524
We can spare four masons
for a week, my lord.

164
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,569
Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?

165
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,696
I believe it will.

166
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,622
We didn't want him here all day, did we?

167
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,501
I didn't like the way
he was talking about Robb.

168
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,252
Nor did I.

169
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,591
But listening to people
you'd rather not listen to

170
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:01,553
is one of your responsibilities
as Lord of Winterfell.

171
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,892
Lord Portan.

172
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,895
My lord, may the old gods
watch over your brother

173
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,647
and all our Northern sons.

174
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:04,032
Boil this for an hour and drink the tea.

175
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,536
Makes all your pain go away.

176
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,121
Don't have any pain.

177
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,707
Lucky for you.

178
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,293
That way.

179
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,798
You've been having those dreams again.

180
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,550
I don't dream.

181
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,135
Everyone dreams.

182
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,803
I don't.

183
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,223
Heard some of the men
talking about the comet.

184
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,517
They say it's an omen.

185
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:34,021
They say it means Robb
will win a great victory in the South.

186
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,564
Did they?

187
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,153
I heard some other fools say
it's Lannister Red.

188
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,406
Means the Lannisters
will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long.

189
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,951
Heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood

190
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,204
to mark the death of your father.

191
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,336
The stars don't fall for men.

192
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,880
Red comet means one thing, boy.

193
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,591
Dragons.

194
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:07,346
The dragons are all dead.

195
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,765
They've been dead for centuries.

196
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,053
Mmm.

197
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,727
What did your brother say
about them, Khaleesi?

198
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,479
He said they ate meat.

199
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,148
He didn't tell you what kind of meat?

200
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,236
My brother didn't know
anything about dragons.

201
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,322
He didn't know anything about anything.

202
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,412
Eh.

203
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,233
She was Drogo's first gift to me.

204
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,028
I remember.

205
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,782
I promised to protect them.

206
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,118
Promised them
their enemies would die screaming.

207
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,579
How do I make starvation scream?

208
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,373
A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.

209
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,711
Does it ever end?

210
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,630
This is further east than I've ever been.

211
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,799
But, yes, Khaleesi,
everything ends, even the Red Waste.

212
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,302
And you're sure there's no other way?

213
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,013
If we go south to the land of the Lhazareen,

214
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,599
the Lamb Men will kill us
and take your dragons.

215
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,476
If we go west to the Dothraki Sea,

216
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,146
the first khalasar we meet
will kill us and take your dragons.

217
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,649
No one will take my dragons.

218
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,653
They are too weak to fight,

219
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,821
as are your people.

220
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,990
You must be their strength.

221
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,035
As you are mine.

222
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:51,677
Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.
Take our remaining horses.

223
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:56,181
You will ride east, you southeast,
and you northeast.

224
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,559
What do we seek, Khaleesi?

225
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:05,774
Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people.
Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea.

226
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:11,446
Find how far the Red Waste extends
before us, and what lies on the other side.

227
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,750
Rakharo.

228
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,796
You are my last hope, blood of my blood.

229
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:31,383
I will not fail you, blood of my blood.

230
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,302
You never have.

231
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,769
This is bad time to start.

232
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,119
Having a rough time of it?

233
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,704
Nothing's killed me yet.

234
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,457
Your arse killed the sledge.
- You offered me a ride.

235
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,460
I just wanted you to shut up
about your damn blisters.

236
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,519
I was born in a place like this.

237
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,522
Later, I fell on hard times.

238
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,025
Are those girls?

239
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,860
Craster's daughters.

240
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,572
I haven't seen a girl in six months.

241
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,741
I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.

242
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,911
What, he don't like people
messing with his daughters?

243
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,580
He don't like people messing with his wives.

244
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,419
He marries his daughters,
and they give him more daughters.

245
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,588
And on and on it goes.

246
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,550
- That's foul.
- It's beyond foul.

247
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:40,470
All the other wildlings
for a hundred leagues have disappeared.

248
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:42,514
Craster's still here.

249
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,016
He must be doing something right.

250
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,520
What happens to the boys?

251
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,729
Hmm?

252
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,523
He marries his daughters.

253
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,484
What does he do with his sons?

254
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,074
He said he planned to stop here
on his way to the Frostfangs.

255
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,742
People make all sorts of plans.

256
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:06,204
I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years.

257
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,706
Haven't missed him.

258
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,375
Always treated me like scum.

259
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,462
Haven't had any good wine for a long time.

260
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,382
You Southerners make good wine,
I'll give you that.

261
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,384
We're not Southerners.

262
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,094
Who's this little girl?

263
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,432
You're prettier than half my daughters.

264
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:28,810
You got a nice wet twat between your legs?

265
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,645
What's your name?

266
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,647
- Jon Snow.
- Snow, eh?

267
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,650
Listen to me, bastard.

268
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:39,696
All you lot from south of the Wall,
you're Southerners.

269
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,450
But now you're in the North, the real North.

270
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:44,993
The lad meant no harm.

271
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:50,081
I catch that pretty little bastard
talking to my daughters...

272
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:54,044
No one will talk to your daughters,
you have my word.

273
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:57,172
Now, sit down and shut your mouth.

274
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,427
You bring any of that good wine with you?

275
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,095
We did.

276
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,806
We passed through
six villages on the way here.

277
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,767
All six were abandoned.

278
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,728
Where have all the wildlings gone?

279
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,190
I could tell you, but I'm thirsty.

280
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,651
There's a barrel of Dornish wine
on the sledge.

281
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,320
- Bring it in here.
Yes, Commander.

282
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,490
You want to know
where they've all gone?

283
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:27,577
North, to join up with Mance Rayder.

284
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,705
Your old friend.

285
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,333
He's no friend of mine.

286
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,796
- He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers.
- Aye.

287
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,966
But once he was just a poor black crow.

288
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,885
And now he's King-beyond-the-Wall.

289
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,388
He's been calling himself that for years.

290
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:50,058
What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?

291
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,603
That's a good-looking ax.

292
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,647
Fresh forged?

293
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,234
Give it here.

294
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,529
You'll have another one made at Castle Black.

295
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,572
Here.

296
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,118
That's some lovely steel.

297
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:15,000
You want to know
what Mance Rayder is doing?

298
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,418
Gathering an army.

299
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,839
What I hear, he's already got more men
than any of your Southern Kings.

300
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:24,175
And where does he plan marching this army?

301
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,220
When you're all the way north,
there's only one direction to go.

302
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,810
These are bad times to be
living alone in the wild.

303
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,312
The cold winds are rising.

304
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:41,026
Let them come. My roots are sunk deep.

305
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,571
Wife,

306
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:48,616
tell the Lord Crow how content we are.

307
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,036
This is our place.

308
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,912
Our husband keeps us safe.

309
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,999
Better to live free than die a slave.

310
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,504
Don't it make
you jealous, old man,

311
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:06,885
to see me with all these young wives
and you with no one to warm your bed?

312
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,012
We chose different paths.

313
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:13,266
Aye, and you chose the path
with no one but boys on it.

314
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:18,271
You'll be wanting to sleep
beneath my roof, I suppose,

315
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,440
and eat me out of pigs.

316
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,400
A roof would be welcome.

317
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:23,902
It's been hard riding.

318
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,197
We've brought our own food
and good steel for you.

319
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,535
Any man lays a hand on one of my wives,

320
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,246
he loses the hand.

321
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,211
And I see this one staring too long,

322
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,297
I might just gouge his eyes out.

323
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:47,717
Your roof, your rules.

324
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,398
Who am I?

325
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:06,611
- Who am I?
- Lord Commander.

326
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,781
- And who are you?
- Jon Snow.

327
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,241
Who are you?

328
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,202
Your steward.

329
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,704
You want to lead one day?

330
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,960
Then learn how to follow.

331
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,231
Lord of Light,
come to us in our darkness.

332
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,360
We offer you these false gods.

333
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,114
Take them and cast your light upon us,

334
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,244
for the night is dark and full of terrors.

335
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:00,248
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

336
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,544
After the long summer,

337
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,505
darkness will fall heavy on the world.

338
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,175
The stars will bleed.

339
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,844
We need to stop her.

340
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,681
The cold breath of winter
will freeze the seas...

341
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:20,935
- Not now.
...and the dead shall rise in the North.

342
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:26,274
All you men were named
in the light of the Seven!

343
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,402
Is this how you treat the gods of your fathers?

344
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:34,073
Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?

345
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,084
You smell of fear,

346
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:49,130
fear and piss and old bones.

347
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,217
Do you want to stop me?

348
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,598
Stop me.

349
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,279
In the ancient books, it's written

350
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:17,075
that a warrior will draw
a burning sword from the fire.

351
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:21,412
And that sword shall be Lightbringer.

352
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,796
Stannis Baratheon,

353
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,382
Warrior of Light,

354
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,217
your sword awaits you.

355
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,959
Lord, cast your light upon us!

356
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,839
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

357
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,095
For the night is dark and full of terror.

358
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:50,001
This woman will lead him
into a war he cannot win.

359
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,669
Stannis is our king.

360
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:53,171
We follow where he leads,

361
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,757
- even if we don't like the path.
- King.

362
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:59,927
Since that boar killed his brother,
every lord wants a coronation.

363
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,180
I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.

364
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,890
As do I,

365
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:07,602
but loyal service means telling hard truths.

366
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,689
He's surrounded by fools and fanatics,

367
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,818
but he trusts you, Davos.

368
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,488
If you tell him the truth...

369
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,949
What's the truth?

370
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:38,174
"And I declare upon the honor of
my house that my beloved brother Robert..."

371
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,802
He wasn't my beloved brother.

372
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,970
I didn't love him. He didn't love me.

373
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,889
A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.

374
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,015
A lie. Take it out.

375
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,104
"That my brother Robert
left no trueborn heirs,

376
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:55,775
"the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen,
and the girl Myrcella being born of incest

377
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,903
"between Cersei Lannister
and her brother Jaime Lannister.

378
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,739
- "By right of birth..."
- Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

379
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,157
Call him what he is.

380
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,662
"And her brother Jaime Lannister,
the Kingslayer."

381
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,040
"By right of birth and blood,
I do this day lay claim..."

382
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:14,001
Make it Ser Jaime Lannister,
the Kingslayer.

383
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,129
Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight.

384
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,548
"Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

385
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,842
"By right of birth and blood,

386
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,970
"I do this day lay claim
to the Iron Throne of Westeros.

387
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,681
"Let all true men declare their loyalty."

388
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,058
When Eddard Stark learned
the truth, he told only me.

389
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:31,352
I'll not make the same mistake.

390
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,438
Send copies of that letter
to every corner of the realm,

391
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,440
from the Arbor to the Wall.

392
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,692
The time has come to choose.

393
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,862
Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.

394
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,448
Your Grace, the Lannisters are
the true enemy.

395
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,616
If, for the time being,
you could make peace with your brother...

396
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,785
I'll not make peace
with Renly while he calls himself king.

397
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,662
Well, many have already declared for him,

398
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,956
Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.

399
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,251
Stannis does not need
to beg this lord or that lord for support.

400
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,836
The Lord of Light stands behind him.

401
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,173
And how many ships
has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?

402
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,717
- He has no need for ships.
I'm sure he doesn't,

403
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,343
but we do if we're going to war.

404
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,472
If not Renly, Your Grace,
join forces with Robb Stark.

405
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,640
Who would steal
the northern half of my kingdom.

406
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:13,144
I've always served thieves according
to their deserts, as you well know, Ser Davos.

407
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,272
Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves.

408
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,774
They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.

409
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,570
I owe you an apology, my king.

410
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,364
My duty is to serve.

411
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:29,577
You have chosen the new god
over the old gods.

412
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:33,039
May the Lord of Light watch over us all.

413
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,458
Shall we drink together?

414
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,001
Don't.

415
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:42,089
A cup of wine to honor the one true god.

416
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,639
The night is dark and full of terrors, old man,

417
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,809
but the fire burns them all away.

418
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,846
King in the North.

419
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,311
I keep expecting you to leave me
in one castle or another for safekeeping,

420
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:21,272
but you drag me along from camp to camp.

421
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,109
Have you grown fond of me, Stark?

422
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,986
Is that it?

423
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,863
I've never seen you with a girl.

424
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,450
If I left you with one of my bannermen,

425
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,536
your father would know within a fortnight

426
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:39,165
and my bannerman would receive
a raven with a message,

427
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:42,793
"Release my son
and you'll be rich beyond your dreams.

428
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:46,297
"Refuse and your house
will be destroyed, root and stem."

429
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:50,885
You don't trust the loyalty
of the men following you into battle?

430
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,012
Oh, I trust them with my life,

431
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:55,556
just not with yours.

432
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,142
Smart boy.

433
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,144
What's wrong?

434
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,812
Don't like being called "boy"?

435
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,732
Insulted?

436
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:14,742
You insult yourself, Kingslayer.

437
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,996
You've been defeated by a boy.

438
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:22,208
You're held captive by a boy.

439
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,921
Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy.

440
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,556
Stannis Baratheon sent ravens
to all the high lords of Westeros.

441
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,687
King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king

442
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,398
nor a true Baratheon.

443
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,692
He's your bastard son.

444
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,111
If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king.

445
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,238
How convenient for him.

446
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:56,575
My father learned the truth.

447
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,285
That's why you had him executed.

448
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,621
I was your prisoner
when Ned Stark lost his head.

449
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:04,375
Your son killed him
so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him.

450
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,710
And you,

451
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,089
you pushed my brother from a window
because he saw you with the queen.

452
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,304
You have proof?

453
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,058
Or do you want to trade gossip
like a couple of fishwives?

454
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:25,020
I'm sending one of your cousins down to
King's Landing with my peace terms.

455
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,523
You think my father's going
to negotiate with you?

456
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:30,443
You don't know him very well.

457
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:34,113
No, but he's starting to know me.

458
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:38,451
Three victories don't make you a conqueror.

459
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,495
It's better than three defeats.

460
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,818
This city stinks.

461
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,656
Like dead bodies.

462
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,825
A bit corpsey, yes.

463
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,369
And shit.

464
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,038
I thought you wanted to come here.

465
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,084
I love it.

466
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,047
You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?

467
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:36,675
And cum and garlic and rum.

468
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,261
You can smell cum from the balcony?

469
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:43,307
I love the stink. I love the noise.

470
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,392
Cities make me want to fuck.

471
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,562
And so did the country.

472
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,317
This is where I belong.

473
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,195
Yes, well, you need to be careful.

474
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,822
No one can know you're here.

475
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,490
No one will know.

476
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,283
You can't trust anyone in King's Landing.

477
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:04,328
They're all liars, good liars, bad liars,

478
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,831
one or two great liars.

479
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,791
What about you?

480
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,627
Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.

481
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,380
Truth?

482
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:19,343
You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.

483
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,387
Why do you think I am so little?

484
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:25,766
I'm being crushed beneath
the weight of all that truth.

485
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,982
Ned Stark actually slept on this.

486
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:36,694
As if the poor man didn't suffer enough.

487
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,116
One of the many changes
we'll have to make around here.

488
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:55,212
Lord Baelish.

489
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:56,547
Your Grace.

490
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,091
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.

491
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,718
Of course, Your Grace.

492
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,720
Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya,

493
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:04,972
we can't seem to locate her.

494
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,602
If she's escaped the capital,
Winterfell seems the logical destination.

495
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,104
And yet my friends in the North
report no sign of her.

496
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,064
Curious.

497
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,233
If we choose to negotiate with the Starks,

498
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,319
the girl has some value. Whoever finds her...

499
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,654
Well, you know what they say
about Lannisters and debts.

500
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,115
Well, you could ask Varys where she is.

501
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,451
He'll have an answer for you.

502
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,952
Whether you believe it...

503
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:31,040
Myself, I have always had
a hard time trusting eunuchs.

504
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,584
Who knows what they want?

505
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,586
A mockingbird.

506
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,673
- You created your own sigil, didn't you?
- Yes.

507
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:44,428
Appropriate, for a self-made man
with so many songs to sing.

508
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,096
I'm glad you like it.

509
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:49,642
Some people are fortunate enough
to be born into the right family.

510
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:52,186
Others have to find their own way.

511
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,773
I heard a song once

512
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,442
about a boy of modest means

513
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,028
who found his way into the home
of a very prominent family.

514
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:03,989
He loved the eldest daughter.

515
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,408
Sadly, she had eyes for another.

516
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:11,747
When boys and girls live in the same home,
awkward situations can arise.

517
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:17,127
Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers
and sisters develop certain affections.

518
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,214
And when those affections
become common knowledge,

519
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:24,134
well, that is an awkward situation indeed,

520
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,345
especially in a prominent family.

521
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,722
But prominent families
often forget a simple truth,

522
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,183
I've found.

523
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,269
And which truth is that?

524
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,689
Knowledge is power.

525
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,486
Seize him.

526
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,240
Cut his throat.

527
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:49,076
Stop. Wait.

528
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,246
I've changed my mind. Let him go.

529
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,917
Step back three paces.

530
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,129
Turn around.

531
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,339
Close your eyes.

532
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,262
Power is power.

533
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:14,685
Do see if you can take some time away
from your coins and your whores

534
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,603
to locate the Stark girl for me.

535
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,356
I would very much appreciate it.

536
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,119
You're Ser Alton Lannister?

537
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,788
I am, Your Grace.

538
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:38,250
I offer your cousins peace
if they meet my terms.

539
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,629
First, your family must release my sisters.

540
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,258
Second, my father's bones
must be returned to us

541
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:51,055
so he may rest beside his brother and sister
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

542
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:55,142
And the remains of all those who died
in his service must also be returned.

543
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,103
Their families can honor them
with proper funerals.

544
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:00,981
- An honorable request, Your Grace.
- Third...

545
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:07,321
Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce
all claim to dominion of the North.

546
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:12,659
From this time till the end of time,
we are a free and independent kingdom.

547
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,745
The King in the North.

548
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,247
- King in the North.
- King in the North.

549
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:21,043
Neither Joffrey nor any of his men
shall set foot in our lands again.

550
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,128
If he disregards this command,

551
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:26,090
he shall suffer the same fate as my father,

552
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:30,928
only I don't need a servant
to do my beheading for me.

553
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:34,389
These are... Your Grace, these are...

554
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,975
These are my terms.

555
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,145
If the Queen Regent and her son meet them,
I'll give them peace.

556
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,522
If not,

557
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,776
I will litter the South with Lannister dead.

558
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,570
King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.

559
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,197
Oh, is he?

560
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:54,159
You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton.

561
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,454
That will be all for tonight.

562
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,429
A word, Your Grace?

563
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,976
You don't have to call me "Your Grace"
when no one's around.

564
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,687
It's not so bad once you get used to it.

565
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,730
I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.

566
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,900
The Lannisters are going
to reject your terms, you know?

567
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,819
Of course they are.

568
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,196
We can fight them
in the fields as long as you like,

569
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:34,575
but we won't beat them
until you take King's Landing.

570
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,621
And we can't take King's Landing
without ships.

571
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,166
My father has ships
and men who know how to sail them.

572
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,001
Men who fought my father.

573
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:46,336
Men who fought King Robert
to free themselves

574
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:50,090
from the yoke of the South,
just like you're doing now.

575
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,427
I'm his only living son.

576
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,556
He'll listen to me. I know he will.

577
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,769
I'm not a Stark. I know that.

578
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,273
But your father raised me
to be an honorable man.

579
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,611
We can avenge him together.

580
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,907
You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

581
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:17,284
I need his ships. They say he has 200.

582
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:21,246
They say a million rats
live in the sewers of King's Landing.

583
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:22,831
Shall we rally them to fight for us?

584
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,791
I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.

585
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:28,670
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy
because he is not trustworthy.

586
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,049
Your father had to go to war
to end his rebellion.

587
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:35,886
Yes. And now I'm the one
rebelling against the throne.

588
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,222
Before me, it was Father.

589
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,973
You married one rebel and mothered another.

590
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,976
I mothered more than just rebels,

591
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,270
a fact you seem to have forgotten.

592
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:49,608
If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls,
my bannermen will string me up by my feet.

593
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,903
You want to leave Sansa
in the queen's hands?

594
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,988
And Arya...

595
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:59,826
I haven't heard a word about Arya.
What are we fighting for, if not for them?

596
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:03,455
It's more complicated than that!
You know it is.

597
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,514
It's time for me to go home.

598
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,518
I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.

599
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,813
You can't go to Winterfell.

600
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,148
I beg your pardon?

601
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:33,610
I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys

602
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:38,073
because tomorrow
you'll ride south to the Stormlands.

603
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,158
Why in the name of all the gods...

604
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:44,037
Because I need you
to negotiate with Renly Baratheon.

605
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,206
He's rallied an army of 100,000.

606
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,041
You know him. You know his family.

607
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,502
I haven't seen Renly Baratheon
since he was a boy.

608
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,878
You have a hundred other lords...

609
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,965
Which of these lords
do I trust more than you?

610
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,677
If Renly sides with us,

611
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,263
we'll outnumber them two to one.

612
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,141
When they feel the jaws beginning to shut,
they'll sue for peace.

613
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,893
We'll get the girls back.

614
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:09,896
Then we'll all go home, for good.

615
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,282
I will ride at first light.

616
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,294
We will all be together again soon, I promise.

617
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,302
You've done so well.

618
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:44,514
Your father would be proud.

619
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,360
- Give Lord Renly my regards.
- King Renly.

620
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,155
There's a king in every corner now.

621
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,045
What is all this?

622
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,215
Returning this room to its proper appearance.

623
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:21,176
Say what you will about the Targaryens,
they were conquerors.

624
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,887
That is a seat for a conqueror.

625
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:27,557
It needs a room to match it,
not vines and flowers.

626
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:30,060
We can't find Arya Stark.

627
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,145
With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.

628
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,272
Perhaps. But if not, we need her.

629
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:36,608
They'll never give Jaime back
to us for Sansa alone.

630
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,194
I think they might. They're weak.

631
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,196
They put too much value on their women.

632
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,908
We need to set our armies
to the task of finding her.

633
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,952
Send out as many men as we can.

634
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:48,912
I'm sure if you asked Grandfather...

635
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,748
The king does not ask, he commands.

636
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:55,627
And my grandfather's stupidity
in the field of battle

637
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,547
is the reason Robb Stark
has Uncle Jaime in the first place.

638
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,507
His life is in danger.

639
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:03,051
We're at war.

640
00:46:03,136 --> 00:46:05,262
All our lives are in danger.

641
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:11,935
I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime.

642
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,020
And you.

643
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:19,025
Our enemies will say anything
to weaken your claim to the throne.

644
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,986
It's not a claim. The throne is mine.

645
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,364
Of course it is.

646
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,452
No one believes this foul gossip.

647
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,537
Someone believes it.

648
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:34,124
Father had other children?

649
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,960
Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?

650
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,922
What are you asking?

651
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:44,259
I'm asking if he fucked other women
when he grew tired of you.

652
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,678
How many bastards does he have running...

653
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:06,740
What you just did is punishable by death.

654
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,329
You will never do it again.

655
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,664
Never.

656
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,797
That will be all, Mother.

657
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,640
No, no, no, no.

658
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:34,518
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

659
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,019
Ease into it.

660
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,105
Slowly, with passion.

661
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:42,776
Oh, yeah.

662
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,780
Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on.

663
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,366
Both of you are working tonight.

664
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,205
We do things differently here, Daisy.

665
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:59,167
This isn't some five-copper
bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.

666
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:01,836
- Haystack Hall.
- Wherever you're from.

667
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:06,383
Our establishment doesn't cater
to plowmen and goat herders.

668
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,218
Lord Olsen.

669
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,220
Taste is everything here.

670
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,222
Littlefinger's a fancy man.

671
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,932
Don't call him Littlefinger.

672
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,433
He doesn't like it.

673
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,852
Lord Baelish.

674
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:25,694
She pretends she doesn't
speak the common tongue

675
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:28,363
so that people will think she's exotic.

676
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,241
She grew up just down the road
in Flea Bottom.

677
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,785
She's beautiful.

678
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:37,163
She's a dumb slut, really,
but a lid for every pot.

679
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,546
Lord Commander.

680
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,465
Good to see you again.

681
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:06,526
You do realize this establishment
is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish,

682
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:08,778
the King's Master of Coin.

683
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,697
Coin which goes in many pockets.

684
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,408
- Orders.
- Whose orders?

685
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,244
Someone who doesn't care
what Littlefinger thinks.

686
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:37,140
No, you can't. No! Please!

687
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,352
No! Not my Barra!

688
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:43,855
- Please. Please.
- Enough. Get it done.

689
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,815
- Kill the bastard.
No, no!

690
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,318
- Please.
- Give it here.

691
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,570
No, please.

692
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,249
Spread out. Search every house.

693
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,585
Every room. Look in every room.

694
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,696
Gendry! His name is Gendry.

695
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,531
Where is the bastard?

696
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:37,200
The Night's Watch! Please, stop!

697
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,702
Where?

698
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,705
They took him up the Kingsroad,
heading north.

699
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:45,375
- How will we know him?
- He's got a bull's head helmet.
