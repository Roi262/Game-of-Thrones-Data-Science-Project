1
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,466
Your Grace.

2
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:23,203
The trial will be
getting under way soon.

3
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:57,120
You got my money?

4
00:04:57,222 --> 00:04:59,522
Later. Go away.

5
00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:12,088
Grand Maester.

6
00:05:52,496 --> 00:05:54,964
Ser Loras Tyrell.

7
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:59,534
Are you prepared to stand trial

8
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:03,338
and profess your guilt or
innocence before the Seven?

9
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:08,343
There'll be no need for a trial.

10
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:13,249
I confess before the Seven

11
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,350
and freely admit to my crimes.

12
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:19,588
To which crimes will you be confessing?

13
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:22,024
All of them.

14
00:06:23,761 --> 00:06:25,460
I lay with other men

15
00:06:25,562 --> 00:06:28,998
including the traitor Renly Baratheon.

16
00:06:32,503 --> 00:06:35,271
I perjured myself before the gods.

17
00:06:35,372 --> 00:06:37,673
I am guilty of depravity...

18
00:06:39,177 --> 00:06:41,177
dishonesty,

19
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,744
profligacy,

20
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:45,714
and arrogance.

21
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:47,249
I see that now.

22
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,854
I humble myself before the Seven

23
00:06:51,956 --> 00:06:55,357
and accept whatever punishment
the gods deem just.

24
00:06:57,394 --> 00:07:02,264
The gods' judgment is fierce,

25
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:04,900
but also fair.

26
00:07:05,002 --> 00:07:08,370
The Warrior punishes those
who believe themselves

27
00:07:08,472 --> 00:07:10,739
beyond the reach of justice.

28
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:15,311
But the Mother shows her mercy

29
00:07:15,412 --> 00:07:19,215
to those who kneel before her.

30
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:29,959
I take full responsibility
for my many sins

31
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:32,561
and unburden myself of my desires.

32
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:38,968
My only remaining wish

33
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,670
is to devote my life to the Seven.

34
00:07:42,471 --> 00:07:44,840
May I be a living example of their grace

35
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:47,609
for others to witness.

36
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,647
You understand fully

37
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,583
what this means?

38
00:07:55,031 --> 00:07:56,185
I do.

39
00:07:58,756 --> 00:08:00,890
I will abandon the Tyrell name

40
00:08:00,992 --> 00:08:04,026
and all that goes with it.

41
00:08:04,128 --> 00:08:07,897
I will renounce my lordship
and my claims on Highgarden.

42
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:13,769
I will never marry

43
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:16,272
and I will never father children.

44
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,810
Brother Loras...

45
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:26,681
...I ask you to dedicate
your life to the seven gods.

46
00:08:30,922 --> 00:08:33,722
Will you fight to defend your faith

47
00:08:33,824 --> 00:08:36,258
against heretics and apostates?

48
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,859
I will.

49
00:09:07,058 --> 00:09:08,223
No, I can't let them...

50
00:09:08,326 --> 00:09:11,293
Faith is the way, Father.

51
00:09:33,851 --> 00:09:35,017
All right.

52
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:37,953
I'm ready.

53
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:47,896
I have to go. I'm...

54
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,931
I'm late for the trial.

55
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,180
You mutilated him.

56
00:10:05,282 --> 00:10:07,182
You gave me your word.

57
00:10:07,284 --> 00:10:09,651
And I have kept my word.

58
00:10:09,753 --> 00:10:12,521
Once the queen mother's
trial is concluded,

59
00:10:12,623 --> 00:10:14,656
Brother Loras is free to leave.

60
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:16,658
And where is the queen mother?

61
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,029
Her litter never left the Red Keep.

62
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:24,066
It appears the queen mother doesn't
wish to attend her own trial.

63
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,138
Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.

64
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:57,766
Get the others.

65
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,743
Where's the king?

66
00:11:44,715 --> 00:11:46,648
Elsewhere, I'm afraid.

67
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,383
What's the meaning of this?

68
00:11:48,486 --> 00:11:50,352
I was told that...

69
00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:54,123
I have more important
things to do with my time

70
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:55,591
than waste them in the presence...

71
00:11:55,692 --> 00:11:58,360
Please, Grand Maester. I
bear you no ill will.

72
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,164
Please forgive me if you can.

73
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,064
This pains me, my lord.

74
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:38,233
Whatever your faults, you do not deserve

75
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:41,303
to die alone in such a cold, dark place.

76
00:12:41,405 --> 00:12:45,140
But sometimes before we
can usher in the new,

77
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:49,378
the old must be put to rest.

78
00:13:30,554 --> 00:13:33,655
The longer you wait, the
worse it'll be for you.

79
00:14:00,618 --> 00:14:02,651
What are you doing?

80
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,086
There's something wrong.

81
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:14,656
You have nothing to fear, Your Grace.

82
00:15:14,758 --> 00:15:16,625
The trial will begin shortly.

83
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:19,428
Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here.

84
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,862
Why do you think they're not here?

85
00:15:20,964 --> 00:15:22,798
If the accused is not here,

86
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:24,966
she will be tried regardless.

87
00:15:25,068 --> 00:15:27,302
We cannot escape the
justice of the gods...

88
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:30,038
Forget about the bloody gods and
listen to what I'm telling you!

89
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,575
Cersei understands the
consequences of her absence

90
00:15:33,677 --> 00:15:35,444
and she is absent anyway,

91
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:39,414
which means she does not intend
to suffer those consequences.

92
00:15:39,516 --> 00:15:43,385
The trial can wait.
We all need to leave.

93
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:11,279
We all need to leave now!

94
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:18,687
Loras.

95
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:20,955
Stay with me.

96
00:16:33,404 --> 00:16:36,204
Let me through. Let me through.

97
00:16:38,074 --> 00:16:40,375
Get out of my way.

98
00:16:48,685 --> 00:16:50,619
Let us through.

99
00:18:20,076 --> 00:18:22,110
Confess.

100
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,247
Confess.

101
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:32,587
- No.
- Confess.

102
00:18:42,198 --> 00:18:45,033
Confess. It felt good.

103
00:18:45,135 --> 00:18:48,837
Beating me, starving me,

104
00:18:48,939 --> 00:18:51,840
frightening me, humiliating me.

105
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:58,500
You didn't do it because you
cared about my atonement.

106
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:01,658
You did it because it felt good.

107
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:04,023
I understand.

108
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:06,454
I do things because they feel good.

109
00:19:09,426 --> 00:19:12,761
I drink because it feels good.

110
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:16,965
I killed my husband because it
felt good to be rid of him.

111
00:19:20,303 --> 00:19:25,273
I fuck my brother because it feels
good to feel him inside me.

112
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,442
I lie about fucking my brother...

113
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:33,481
because it feels good to keep our
son safe from hateful hypocrites.

114
00:19:36,286 --> 00:19:38,053
I killed your High Sparrow...

115
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:42,190
and all his little sparrows...

116
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,128
all his septons, all his septas,

117
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,065
all his filthy soldiers,

118
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:53,367
because it felt good to watch them burn.

119
00:19:55,205 --> 00:19:59,040
It felt good to imagine
their shock and their pain.

120
00:19:59,142 --> 00:20:02,477
No thought has ever
given me greater joy.

121
00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:11,686
Even confessing feels good
under the right circumstances.

122
00:20:17,861 --> 00:20:19,894
You've always been quiet.

123
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:30,839
I said my face would be the last
thing you saw before you died.

124
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:33,008
Do you remember?

125
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,076
Good.

126
00:20:37,347 --> 00:20:39,614
I'm glad to see your face.

127
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:44,452
I'm ready to meet the gods.

128
00:20:44,554 --> 00:20:45,887
What?

129
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:49,824
Now?

130
00:20:49,926 --> 00:20:51,392
Today?

131
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:56,898
You're not going to die today.

132
00:20:59,402 --> 00:21:01,870
You're not going to die
for quite a while.

133
00:21:04,307 --> 00:21:06,274
Ser Gregor.

134
00:21:10,313 --> 00:21:12,580
This is Ser Gregor Clegane.

135
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:15,283
He's quiet, too.

136
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:28,029
Your gods have forsaken you.

137
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:31,399
This is your god now.

138
00:21:42,612 --> 00:21:44,412
No.

139
00:21:45,515 --> 00:21:46,681
No.

140
00:21:48,218 --> 00:21:51,452
Shame.

141
00:21:51,554 --> 00:21:54,789
Shame.

142
00:21:54,891 --> 00:21:58,593
Shame.

143
00:22:03,499 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm very sorry, Your Grace.

144
00:22:07,537 --> 00:22:09,303
Very sorry.

145
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,449
For House Lannister!

146
00:22:55,551 --> 00:22:57,485
Hear me roar!

147
00:23:03,126 --> 00:23:05,326
For House Frey!

148
00:23:05,428 --> 00:23:08,496
We stand together!

149
00:23:08,598 --> 00:23:11,465
May we stand together
through the centuries,

150
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:14,035
good friends to the last.

151
00:23:14,137 --> 00:23:18,173
And when we drive our swords
through our enemies' hearts,

152
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:22,076
may we speak the words of our alliance,

153
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:25,579
"The Freys and the Lannisters

154
00:23:25,682 --> 00:23:27,882
send their regards."

155
00:23:45,202 --> 00:23:47,702
You don't even have to
do anything, do you?

156
00:23:49,105 --> 00:23:51,372
You just sit there, a rich slab of beef,

157
00:23:51,474 --> 00:23:52,907
and all the birds come pecking.

158
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:55,409
- You're welcome to her.
- She doesn't want me.

159
00:23:55,511 --> 00:23:57,912
She wants your golden
fingers up her twat.

160
00:23:59,782 --> 00:24:01,883
Those two have their eyes on you.

161
00:24:04,054 --> 00:24:05,953
They have their eyes on you, cunt.

162
00:24:06,652 --> 00:24:07,655
Not my type.

163
00:24:07,757 --> 00:24:09,324
Not blonde enough?

164
00:24:11,794 --> 00:24:15,230
Ladies, have you met Ser
Bronn of the Blackwater,

165
00:24:15,332 --> 00:24:17,498
hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay?

166
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,968
- There you go.
- Maybe I'm not in the mood.

167
00:24:23,804 --> 00:24:24,874
Fuck it.

168
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:28,042
No need to call me ser just
because I'm an anointed knight.

169
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,783
This came together rather well.

170
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,687
Your father would be pleased.

171
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:41,455
I'm sure he would be.

172
00:24:44,094 --> 00:24:46,928
Edmure is back in a cell.

173
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:50,664
Can't go killing my son by law.
It wouldn't be right.

174
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:52,934
Give the family a bad name.

175
00:24:56,406 --> 00:25:00,341
So the famous Blackfish
killed by foot soldiers, eh?

176
00:25:00,443 --> 00:25:03,344
Legendary warrior, everyone said.

177
00:25:04,814 --> 00:25:07,115
Have you done much fighting
yourself, Lord Frey?

178
00:25:07,217 --> 00:25:09,750
I'm a bit old for all that.

179
00:25:09,852 --> 00:25:12,553
No, but back in your day.

180
00:25:12,655 --> 00:25:15,589
The purpose of fighting

181
00:25:15,691 --> 00:25:18,893
is defeating your enemies, isn't it?

182
00:25:18,995 --> 00:25:20,995
I've defeated mine.

183
00:25:21,097 --> 00:25:24,799
Riverrun belonged to House
Tully for a thousand years.

184
00:25:24,901 --> 00:25:26,467
Now it's mine.

185
00:25:26,569 --> 00:25:28,869
What do you call that?

186
00:25:28,972 --> 00:25:30,238
Victory.

187
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,840
Yes, you're a great conqueror.

188
00:25:34,444 --> 00:25:38,212
Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind?

189
00:25:38,315 --> 00:25:41,049
The Tullys mocked me for years.

190
00:25:41,151 --> 00:25:43,318
The Starks mocked me.

191
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,885
Where are they now?

192
00:25:44,988 --> 00:25:47,455
You talk about war as
if you're an expert,

193
00:25:47,557 --> 00:25:49,857
but the one battle I
remember you fighting,

194
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,860
you were captured by Robb
Stark, the Young Wolf.

195
00:25:52,963 --> 00:25:55,863
But it doesn't matter.

196
00:25:55,966 --> 00:25:59,300
Here we are now, two kingslayers.

197
00:25:59,402 --> 00:26:03,271
We know what it's like to
have them grovel to our faces

198
00:26:03,373 --> 00:26:06,374
and snigger behind our backs.

199
00:26:06,476 --> 00:26:08,042
We don't mind, do we?

200
00:26:08,144 --> 00:26:12,113
Fear is a marvelous thing.

201
00:26:12,215 --> 00:26:13,814
They don't fear the Freys, though.

202
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:16,650
They fear the Lannisters.

203
00:26:16,752 --> 00:26:19,120
We gave you the Riverlands
to hold the Riverlands.

204
00:26:19,222 --> 00:26:21,655
If we have to ride north
and take them back for you

205
00:26:21,757 --> 00:26:24,158
every time you lose them,

206
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,227
why do we need you?

207
00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:49,583
Show me.

208
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:54,355
Your Grace, there's no need...

209
00:26:54,457 --> 00:26:55,823
Show me.

210
00:27:08,738 --> 00:27:12,140
What are your thoughts
concerning the king's funeral?

211
00:27:12,242 --> 00:27:14,909
As the Sept of Baelor
is no longer an option,

212
00:27:15,011 --> 00:27:18,779
perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?

213
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,384
He should be with his grandfather,

214
00:27:23,486 --> 00:27:26,320
his brother, his sister.

215
00:27:28,758 --> 00:27:31,426
Burn him

216
00:27:31,528 --> 00:27:34,495
and bury his ashes where
the sept once stood.

217
00:28:32,222 --> 00:28:33,588
Hello.

218
00:28:40,363 --> 00:28:44,064
From Lord Commander
Snow at Castle Black.

219
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:00,948
I'm...

220
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,550
I'm to be the new maester.

221
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,536
According to our records,

222
00:29:21,638 --> 00:29:23,404
Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.

223
00:29:24,807 --> 00:29:26,541
He died.

224
00:29:26,643 --> 00:29:29,210
We received no report from
the maester at Castle Black.

225
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:32,446
Maester Aemon became quite ill
shortly after the election.

226
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:34,815
He's since passed away.

227
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:37,018
Jon Snow will go to
Uploaded By GOTA-FC Team

228
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:38,952
Which is why I'm here.

229
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:44,158
This is irregular.

230
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,294
Yes, well...

231
00:29:46,295 --> 00:29:49,264
I suppose that life is irregular.

232
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:04,612
The archmaester will discuss
these irregularities with you.

233
00:30:07,183 --> 00:30:10,218
In the meantime, you are
permitted to use the library.

234
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,186
Follow me.

235
00:30:15,157 --> 00:30:17,157
No women or children.

236
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:13,708
When we had feasts,

237
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,076
our family would sit up here...

238
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,980
and I'd sit down there.

239
00:32:22,318 --> 00:32:24,885
Could have been worse, Jon Snow.

240
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:26,754
You had a family.

241
00:32:26,856 --> 00:32:28,021
You had feasts.

242
00:32:30,192 --> 00:32:33,327
Aye, you're right. I
was luckier than most.

243
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:50,444
What is that?

244
00:32:52,081 --> 00:32:54,014
Tell him.

245
00:32:57,052 --> 00:32:59,253
Tell him who it belonged to.

246
00:33:04,126 --> 00:33:05,726
The Princess Shireen.

247
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:08,128
Tell him what you did to her.

248
00:33:10,516 --> 00:33:11,598
Tell him!

249
00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:19,707
We burned her at the stake.

250
00:33:32,855 --> 00:33:35,188
Why?

251
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:38,392
The army was trapped.
The horses were dying.

252
00:33:38,494 --> 00:33:41,562
- It was the only way.
- You burned a little girl alive!

253
00:33:41,664 --> 00:33:43,096
I only do what my Lord commands.

254
00:33:43,198 --> 00:33:46,333
If he commands you to burn
children, your Lord is evil.

255
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:51,338
We are standing here because of him.

256
00:33:52,842 --> 00:33:56,109
Jon Snow is alive because
the Lord willed it.

257
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:59,814
I loved that girl like she was my own.

258
00:33:59,916 --> 00:34:03,216
She was good. She was kind.
And you killed her!

259
00:34:05,421 --> 00:34:06,887
So did her father.

260
00:34:09,191 --> 00:34:10,658
So did her mother.

261
00:34:12,862 --> 00:34:15,095
Her own blood knew it was the only way.

262
00:34:15,197 --> 00:34:17,798
The only way for what?

263
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,599
They all died anyway.

264
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,270
You told everyone Stannis was the one.

265
00:34:23,372 --> 00:34:25,706
You had him believing
it, all of them fooled.

266
00:34:25,808 --> 00:34:28,275
- And you lied.
- I didn't lie.

267
00:34:30,012 --> 00:34:31,345
I was wrong.

268
00:34:31,447 --> 00:34:34,682
Aye, you were wrong.

269
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,418
How many died because you were wrong?

270
00:34:43,392 --> 00:34:47,294
I ask your leave to execute
this woman for murder.

271
00:34:47,396 --> 00:34:49,196
She admits to the crime.

272
00:34:51,701 --> 00:34:54,101
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

273
00:34:55,972 --> 00:34:58,706
I've been ready to die for many years.

274
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:03,544
If the Lord was done with
me, so be it, but he's not.

275
00:35:03,646 --> 00:35:06,847
You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow.

276
00:35:06,949 --> 00:35:10,217
You know the great war is still to come.

277
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:13,286
You know the army of the
dead will be upon us soon.

278
00:35:14,524 --> 00:35:17,090
And you know I can
help you win that war.

279
00:35:31,373 --> 00:35:33,240
Ride south today.

280
00:35:34,744 --> 00:35:36,644
If you return to the North,

281
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:39,346
I'll have you hanged as a murderer.

282
00:35:57,099 --> 00:35:59,700
If you ever come back this way,

283
00:35:59,802 --> 00:36:02,169
I will execute you myself.

284
00:36:34,169 --> 00:36:36,971
I'm having the lord's
chamber prepared for you.

285
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:40,741
Mother and Father's room?

286
00:36:42,211 --> 00:36:44,044
You should take it.

287
00:36:45,447 --> 00:36:47,414
I'm not a Stark.

288
00:36:48,325 --> 00:36:49,917
You are to me.

289
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:55,255
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

290
00:36:55,357 --> 00:36:59,259
You deserve it. We're
standing here because of you.

291
00:36:59,361 --> 00:37:02,863
The battle was lost until the
Knights of the Vale rode in.

292
00:37:02,965 --> 00:37:05,165
They came because of you.

293
00:37:09,171 --> 00:37:12,106
You told me Lord Baelish
sold you to the Boltons.

294
00:37:12,207 --> 00:37:13,974
- He did.
- And you trust him?

295
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,711
Only a fool would trust Littlefinger.

296
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:23,617
I should have told you about him,

297
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:27,054
about the Knights of the Vale.

298
00:37:27,156 --> 00:37:28,622
I'm sorry.

299
00:37:39,935 --> 00:37:41,902
We need to trust each other.

300
00:37:42,739 --> 00:37:45,005
We can't fight a war amongst ourselves.

301
00:37:45,107 --> 00:37:47,607
We have so many enemies now.

302
00:38:04,405 --> 00:38:05,893
Jon.

303
00:38:05,995 --> 00:38:09,429
A raven came from the Citadel.

304
00:38:09,531 --> 00:38:11,431
A white raven.

305
00:38:14,136 --> 00:38:15,669
Winter is here.

306
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:31,085
Well, Father always promised, didn't he?

307
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:48,335
The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne,

308
00:38:48,437 --> 00:38:50,537
he was assassinated.

309
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:53,207
100 red scorpions, was it?

310
00:38:53,308 --> 00:38:55,809
You have nothing to fear
from us, Lady Olenna.

311
00:38:55,911 --> 00:38:58,045
You murder your own prince,

312
00:38:58,147 --> 00:38:59,880
but you expect me to trust you?

313
00:38:59,982 --> 00:39:02,950
We invited you to Dorne
because we needed your help.

314
00:39:03,052 --> 00:39:05,318
You came to Dorne because
you needed our help.

315
00:39:06,139 --> 00:39:08,905
What is your name again?

316
00:39:08,906 --> 00:39:10,309
Barbaro?

317
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,091
Obara.

318
00:39:11,193 --> 00:39:14,327
Obara. You look like
an angry little boy.

319
00:39:14,429 --> 00:39:17,064
Don't presume to tell me what I need.

320
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:20,500
Forgive my sister. What she
lacks in diplomacy, she makes...

321
00:39:20,602 --> 00:39:24,104
Do shut up, dear. Anything from you?

322
00:39:24,206 --> 00:39:26,106
No? Good.

323
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,608
Let the grown women speak.

324
00:39:29,507 --> 00:39:32,412
The Lannisters have declared
war on House Tyrell.

325
00:39:32,514 --> 00:39:35,482
They have declared war on Dorne.

326
00:39:35,584 --> 00:39:39,219
We must be allies now
if we wish to survive.

327
00:39:40,522 --> 00:39:43,490
Cersei stole the future from me.

328
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:45,358
She killed my son.

329
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,494
She killed my grandson.

330
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:50,798
She killed my granddaughter.

331
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,733
Survival is not what I'm after now.

332
00:39:53,836 --> 00:39:56,003
You're absolutely right.

333
00:39:56,105 --> 00:39:58,672
I chose the wrong words.

334
00:39:58,774 --> 00:40:01,275
It is not survival I offer.

335
00:40:01,376 --> 00:40:03,710
It is your heart's desire.

336
00:40:05,547 --> 00:40:08,748
And what is my heart's desire?

337
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,552
Vengeance.

338
00:40:12,654 --> 00:40:13,753
Justice.

339
00:40:17,492 --> 00:40:19,359
Fire and blood.

340
00:40:25,835 --> 00:40:28,635
Your ships are nearly ready.

341
00:40:28,737 --> 00:40:31,038
I saw them painting the sails.

342
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:38,278
I'm curious to see how the
Dothraki do on the poison water.

343
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,280
You're not coming with us.

344
00:40:42,651 --> 00:40:45,886
New strategy?

345
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:49,189
You want the Second Sons to
attack from the west coast?

346
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:51,892
If we take Casterly Rock,

347
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:55,562
the Lannisters will have nowhere to
run when you hit King's Landing.

348
00:40:55,664 --> 00:40:57,597
You're not going to Westeros.

349
00:40:57,699 --> 00:41:00,633
You're staying here
with the Second Sons.

350
00:41:00,736 --> 00:41:03,370
There's finally peace in Meereen.

351
00:41:03,472 --> 00:41:06,806
You will keep the peace while the
people choose their own leaders.

352
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,910
Fuck Meereen.

353
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:11,912
Fuck the people.

354
00:41:12,014 --> 00:41:14,281
I'm here for you, not them.

355
00:41:14,383 --> 00:41:16,049
You promised me.

356
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:19,086
"My sword is yours. My life is yours."

357
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:22,289
This is what I command.

358
00:41:23,223 --> 00:41:25,392
If I'm going to rule in Westeros,

359
00:41:25,494 --> 00:41:27,995
I'll need to make alliances.

360
00:41:28,097 --> 00:41:31,464
The best way to make
alliances is with marriage.

361
00:41:34,803 --> 00:41:36,636
Who are you marrying this time?

362
00:41:36,738 --> 00:41:40,107
I don't know. Maybe no one.

363
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:43,310
But you need to lure all the
noble houses to the table?

364
00:41:43,412 --> 00:41:45,379
Are you a queen or fish bait?

365
00:41:47,816 --> 00:41:50,784
I can't bring a lover to Westeros.

366
00:41:50,886 --> 00:41:53,120
A king wouldn't think twice about it.

367
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:56,123
So that's what you want?
To be my mistress?

368
00:41:56,225 --> 00:41:59,526
I'm not proud. I don't care
what perfumed aristocrat

369
00:41:59,628 --> 00:42:01,728
sits beside you in the throne room.

370
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,864
I don't want a crown. I want you.

371
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,041
I love you.

372
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,609
And I make you happy.

373
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,578
You know I do.

374
00:42:20,816 --> 00:42:24,517
Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.

375
00:42:32,127 --> 00:42:33,393
I can't.

376
00:42:43,138 --> 00:42:44,871
The dwarf told you to do this?

377
00:42:44,974 --> 00:42:46,639
No one tells me to do anything.

378
00:42:46,741 --> 00:42:49,909
Clever fellow. Can't
argue with his logic.

379
00:42:50,012 --> 00:42:51,744
I'm no use to you over there.

380
00:42:51,847 --> 00:42:53,113
Don't get angry.

381
00:42:53,215 --> 00:42:56,383
I'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity.

382
00:42:56,485 --> 00:42:58,085
Who comes after you?

383
00:42:58,187 --> 00:43:01,355
Who can ever follow Daenerys
Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?

384
00:43:01,457 --> 00:43:03,723
A great number of women, I imagine.

385
00:43:09,931 --> 00:43:11,764
Specific orders will be left for you

386
00:43:11,867 --> 00:43:14,801
regarding the welfare of Meereen
and the Bay of Dragons.

387
00:43:14,903 --> 00:43:16,703
Bay of Dragons?

388
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:19,806
We can't call it Slaver's
Bay anymore, can we?

389
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:26,113
You'll get that throne you
want so badly, I'm sure of it.

390
00:43:27,449 --> 00:43:29,649
I hope it brings you happiness.

391
00:43:34,723 --> 00:43:37,324
I pity the lords of Westeros.

392
00:43:37,426 --> 00:43:39,592
They have no idea
what's coming for them.

393
00:43:40,771 --> 00:43:43,630
Farewell, Daario Naharis.

394
00:44:02,317 --> 00:44:04,617
How did he take it?

395
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:06,786
No tears.

396
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:11,491
I know it was hard for you.

397
00:44:11,593 --> 00:44:13,626
You turned away a man
who truly loves you

398
00:44:13,728 --> 00:44:16,629
because he would have been a
liability in the Seven Kingdoms.

399
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:22,902
That's the kind of self-sacrifice
that makes for a good ruler,

400
00:44:23,004 --> 00:44:25,172
if it's any consolation.

401
00:44:28,077 --> 00:44:29,876
It's not.

402
00:44:29,978 --> 00:44:32,279
No, I suppose not.

403
00:44:32,381 --> 00:44:33,913
I'm terrible at consoling.

404
00:44:34,015 --> 00:44:36,316
Yes, you really are.

405
00:44:39,488 --> 00:44:43,690
All right, how about the fact
that this is actually happening?

406
00:44:45,194 --> 00:44:48,061
You have your armies,
you have your ships,

407
00:44:48,163 --> 00:44:50,163
you have your dragons.

408
00:44:50,265 --> 00:44:52,232
Everything you've ever wanted

409
00:44:52,334 --> 00:44:55,235
since you were old
enough to want anything,

410
00:44:55,337 --> 00:44:57,204
it's all yours for the taking.

411
00:44:58,974 --> 00:45:00,907
Are you afraid?

412
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,945
Good.

413
00:45:06,047 --> 00:45:08,781
You're in the great game now.

414
00:45:08,883 --> 00:45:11,451
And the great game's terrifying.

415
00:45:11,553 --> 00:45:14,020
The only people who
aren't afraid of failure

416
00:45:14,123 --> 00:45:16,223
are madmen like your father.

417
00:45:18,327 --> 00:45:20,427
Do you know what frightens me?

418
00:45:21,896 --> 00:45:24,564
I said farewell to a man who loves me.

419
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:30,003
A man I thought I cared for.

420
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:32,071
And I felt nothing.

421
00:45:33,675 --> 00:45:35,575
Just impatient to get on with it.

422
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,748
He wasn't the first to love you

423
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:43,916
and he won't be the last.

424
00:45:47,822 --> 00:45:52,725
Well, you have completely
failed to console me.

425
00:45:55,297 --> 00:46:00,100
For what it's worth, I've been a cynic
for as long as I can remember.

426
00:46:00,101 --> 00:46:02,902
Everyone's always asking
me to believe in things...

427
00:46:03,004 --> 00:46:06,739
family, gods, kings, myself.

428
00:46:06,841 --> 00:46:08,675
It was often tempting

429
00:46:08,777 --> 00:46:11,110
until I saw where belief got people.

430
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:15,081
So I said no, thank you to belief.

431
00:46:15,184 --> 00:46:18,485
And yet here I am.

432
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,456
I believe in you.

433
00:46:25,394 --> 00:46:27,794
It's embarrassing, really.

434
00:46:29,864 --> 00:46:31,665
I'd swear you my sword,

435
00:46:31,766 --> 00:46:34,801
but I don't actually own a sword.

436
00:46:34,903 --> 00:46:36,903
It's your counsel I need.

437
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:39,439
It's yours.

438
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:40,973
Now and always.

439
00:46:42,477 --> 00:46:44,311
Good.

440
00:46:45,614 --> 00:46:47,647
I...

441
00:46:47,749 --> 00:46:49,516
I had something made for you.

442
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,753
I'm not sure if it's right.

443
00:47:03,064 --> 00:47:05,765
Tyrion Lannister,

444
00:47:05,867 --> 00:47:07,767
I name you Hand of the Queen.

445
00:47:42,003 --> 00:47:44,537
You're not one of mine, are you?

446
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,139
No, my lord.

447
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:47,907
Didn't think so.

448
00:47:48,009 --> 00:47:50,243
Too pretty.

449
00:47:54,516 --> 00:47:57,317
Where are my damn moron sons?!

450
00:47:57,419 --> 00:48:01,154
Black Walder and Lothar
promised to be here by midday.

451
00:48:01,256 --> 00:48:03,089
They're here, my lord.

452
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:06,493
Well, what are they doing,
trimming their cunt hairs?

453
00:48:06,595 --> 00:48:08,662
Tell them to come here now.

454
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:11,030
But they're already here, my lord.

455
00:48:15,069 --> 00:48:18,070
Here, my lord.

456
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:38,391
They weren't easy to carve.

457
00:48:40,061 --> 00:48:41,961
Especially Black Walder.

458
00:48:43,774 --> 00:48:44,931
What...

459
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,707
My name is Arya Stark.

460
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:55,308
I want you to know that.

461
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:58,144
The last thing you're ever going to see

462
00:48:58,246 --> 00:49:00,980
is a Stark smiling down
at you as you die.

463
00:49:55,771 --> 00:49:57,771
Forgive me, my lady...

464
00:49:59,207 --> 00:50:02,208
if you're at prayer.

465
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:04,310
I'm done with all that.

466
00:50:06,515 --> 00:50:09,048
I came here every day when I was a girl.

467
00:50:10,752 --> 00:50:13,586
I prayed to be somewhere else.

468
00:50:13,688 --> 00:50:17,391
Back then I only thought about what I
wanted, never about what I had.

469
00:50:21,496 --> 00:50:22,929
I was a stupid girl.

470
00:50:23,031 --> 00:50:24,964
You were a child.

471
00:50:28,269 --> 00:50:30,737
What do you want?

472
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:33,205
I thought you knew what I wanted.

473
00:50:33,308 --> 00:50:34,908
I was wrong.

474
00:50:35,009 --> 00:50:37,677
No, you weren't.

475
00:50:40,415 --> 00:50:41,981
Every time I'm faced with a decision,

476
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:44,317
I close my eyes and
see the same picture.

477
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:49,422
Whenever I consider an
action, I ask myself

478
00:50:49,524 --> 00:50:53,660
will this action help to
make this picture a reality?

479
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:58,397
Pull it out of my mind

480
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,333
and into the world?

481
00:51:02,437 --> 00:51:05,404
And I only act if the answer is yes.

482
00:51:08,176 --> 00:51:11,203
A picture of me...

483
00:51:11,204 --> 00:51:13,945
on the Iron Throne...

484
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:17,450
and you by my side.

485
00:51:27,529 --> 00:51:29,428
It's a pretty picture.

486
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:38,471
News of this battle will spread
quickly through the Seven Kingdoms.

487
00:51:38,573 --> 00:51:42,074
I've declared for House
Stark for all to hear.

488
00:51:42,176 --> 00:51:44,644
You've declared for other
houses before, Lord Baelish.

489
00:51:44,746 --> 00:51:47,446
It's never stopped you
from serving yourself.

490
00:51:47,549 --> 00:51:49,749
The past is gone for good.

491
00:51:49,851 --> 00:51:51,918
You can sit here mourning its departure

492
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,954
or you can prepare for the future.

493
00:51:55,056 --> 00:51:57,524
You, my love,

494
00:51:57,626 --> 00:52:00,259
are the future of House Stark.

495
00:52:00,361 --> 00:52:04,030
Who should the North rally behind?

496
00:52:04,132 --> 00:52:06,833
A trueborn daughter of
Ned and Catelyn Stark

497
00:52:06,935 --> 00:52:08,835
born here at Winterfell

498
00:52:08,937 --> 00:52:12,138
or a motherless bastard
born in the south?

499
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,833
This is where I leave you.

500
00:52:40,936 --> 00:52:42,735
You're not coming with us?

501
00:52:44,205 --> 00:52:47,607
The Wall is not just ice and stone.

502
00:52:47,709 --> 00:52:50,877
Ancient spells were carved
into its foundations.

503
00:52:52,681 --> 00:52:54,747
Strong magic

504
00:52:54,849 --> 00:52:57,984
to protect men from what lies beyond.

505
00:52:58,086 --> 00:53:01,921
And while it stands,
the dead cannot pass.

506
00:53:02,023 --> 00:53:03,022
I cannot pass.

507
00:53:19,741 --> 00:53:21,674
Where will you go?

508
00:53:21,776 --> 00:53:23,309
The great war is coming

509
00:53:23,411 --> 00:53:26,212
and I still fight for the living.

510
00:53:28,282 --> 00:53:30,382
I'll do what I can...

511
00:53:31,753 --> 00:53:33,953
as long as I can.

512
00:53:37,859 --> 00:53:39,959
Thank you, Uncle Benjen.

513
00:53:40,061 --> 00:53:42,394
I wish you both good fortune.

514
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:24,203
Are you sure you're ready for this?

515
00:54:24,305 --> 00:54:27,406
I'm the Three-Eyed Raven now.

516
00:54:27,508 --> 00:54:29,742
I have to be ready for this.

517
00:55:03,974 --> 00:55:05,978
Ned?

518
00:55:06,081 --> 00:55:08,581
Lyanna.

519
00:55:08,683 --> 00:55:10,783
Is that you?

520
00:55:14,555 --> 00:55:16,555
Is that really you?

521
00:55:21,495 --> 00:55:23,395
You're not a dream?

522
00:55:24,532 --> 00:55:26,632
No, I'm not a dream.

523
00:55:28,302 --> 00:55:30,169
I'm here.

524
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,606
Right here.

525
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:36,042
I've missed you, big brother.

526
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,380
I've missed you, too.

527
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,620
I want to be brave.

528
00:55:50,258 --> 00:55:52,759
You are.

529
00:55:52,861 --> 00:55:55,594
I'm not.

530
00:55:57,799 --> 00:56:00,566
I don't want to die.

531
00:56:00,668 --> 00:56:02,902
You're not going to die.

532
00:56:06,707 --> 00:56:08,540
Get her some water!

533
00:56:08,643 --> 00:56:10,943
- No, no water.
- Is there a maester?

534
00:56:11,045 --> 00:56:13,379
Listen to me, Ned.

535
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:17,370
_

536
00:56:19,788 --> 00:56:22,521
If Robert finds out, he'll...

537
00:56:22,623 --> 00:56:24,490
you know he will.

538
00:56:24,592 --> 00:56:26,458
You have to protect him.

539
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:31,430
Promise me, Ned.

540
00:56:33,835 --> 00:56:35,701
Promise me.

541
00:56:47,849 --> 00:56:49,816
Promise me, Ned.

542
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:56,088
Promise me.

543
00:57:26,654 --> 00:57:29,555
You can't expect Knights of the Vale

544
00:57:29,657 --> 00:57:32,291
to side with wildling invaders.

545
00:57:32,393 --> 00:57:36,329
We didn't invade. We were invited.

546
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:38,130
Not by me.

547
00:57:38,233 --> 00:57:40,032
The free folk, the northerners,

548
00:57:40,134 --> 00:57:42,501
and the Knights of the
Vale fought bravely,

549
00:57:42,603 --> 00:57:44,904
fought together, and we won.

550
00:57:45,006 --> 00:57:49,742
My father used to say we find our
true friends on the battlefield.

551
00:57:49,844 --> 00:57:52,444
The Boltons are defeated.

552
00:57:52,546 --> 00:57:54,480
The war is over.

553
00:57:54,582 --> 00:57:56,482
Winter has come.

554
00:57:56,584 --> 00:58:00,086
If the maesters are right, it'll be
the coldest one in a thousand years.

555
00:58:00,188 --> 00:58:03,622
We should ride home and
wait out the coming storms.

556
00:58:03,724 --> 00:58:05,824
The war is not over.

557
00:58:05,927 --> 00:58:07,960
And I promise you, friend,

558
00:58:08,062 --> 00:58:10,997
the true enemy won't wait out the storm.

559
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:12,598
He brings the storm.

560
00:58:32,586 --> 00:58:36,655
Your son was butchered at the
Red Wedding, Lord Manderly,

561
00:58:36,757 --> 00:58:38,590
but you refused the call.

562
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:44,931
You swore allegiance to
House Stark, Lord Glover,

563
00:58:45,033 --> 00:58:47,633
but in their hour of greatest need,

564
00:58:47,735 --> 00:58:49,735
you refused the call.

565
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:53,872
And you, Lord Cerwyn,

566
00:58:53,975 --> 00:58:57,843
your father was skinned
alive by Ramsay Bolton.

567
00:58:57,946 --> 00:59:00,413
Still you refused the call.

568
00:59:03,517 --> 00:59:07,386
But House Mormont remembers.

569
00:59:07,488 --> 00:59:10,189
The North remembers.

570
00:59:10,291 --> 00:59:14,860
We know no king but the King in
the North whose name is Stark.

571
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:18,397
I don't care if he's a bastard.

572
00:59:18,499 --> 00:59:21,100
Ned Stark's blood runs
through his veins.

573
00:59:21,202 --> 00:59:25,671
He's my king from this
day until his last day.

574
00:59:42,357 --> 00:59:44,923
Lady Mormont speaks harshly

575
00:59:45,026 --> 00:59:46,325
and truly.

576
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:54,833
My son died for Robb
Stark, the Young Wolf.

577
00:59:54,935 --> 00:59:58,004
I didn't think we'd find
another king in my lifetime.

578
00:59:58,106 --> 01:00:00,539
I didn't commit my men to your cause

579
01:00:00,641 --> 01:00:03,275
'cause I didn't want more
Manderlys dying for nothing.

580
01:00:05,546 --> 01:00:07,013
But I was wrong.

581
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,953
Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding.

582
01:00:15,693 --> 01:00:17,456
He is the White Wolf.

583
01:00:17,558 --> 01:00:20,493
The King in the North.

584
01:00:27,968 --> 01:00:30,436
I did not fight beside you on the field

585
01:00:30,538 --> 01:00:33,972
and I will regret that
until my dying day.

586
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,710
A man can only admit when he was wrong

587
01:00:38,812 --> 01:00:40,379
and ask forgiveness.

588
01:00:43,384 --> 01:00:45,684
There's nothing to forgive, my lord.

589
01:00:48,289 --> 01:00:50,789
There will be more fights to come.

590
01:00:50,891 --> 01:00:54,427
House Glover will stand
behind House Stark

591
01:00:54,529 --> 01:00:56,828
as we have for a thousand years.

592
01:00:58,666 --> 01:01:00,899
And I will stand behind Jon Snow...

593
01:01:03,337 --> 01:01:05,404
the King in the North!

594
01:01:07,308 --> 01:01:10,209
The King in the North!

595
01:01:10,311 --> 01:01:51,872
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

596
01:01:53,787 --> 01:01:55,787
Company halt!

597
01:01:58,792 --> 01:02:00,259
Halt!

598
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:04,263
Halt!

599
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:17,242
Come on.

600
01:03:11,932 --> 01:03:15,701
I now proclaim Cersei
of the House Lannister

601
01:03:15,803 --> 01:03:18,437
First of Her Name,

602
01:03:18,539 --> 01:03:21,907
Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

603
01:03:22,009 --> 01:03:25,211
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.

604
01:04:11,058 --> 01:04:13,125
Long may she reign.

605
01:04:13,227 --> 01:04:15,394
Long may she reign.
