00:01:54,753 --> 00:01:56,771
High Septon: — <i>May the
Warrior grant him courage</i>

4
00:01:56,805 --> 00:02:00,091
and protect him
in these perilous times.

5
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:02,593
May the Smith grant him strength

6
00:02:02,595 --> 00:02:04,478
that he might bear
this heavy burden

7
00:02:04,513 --> 00:02:06,731
And may the Crone,

8
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:09,100
she that knows
the fate of all men,

9
00:02:09,102 --> 00:02:11,736
show him the path he must walk

10
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,189
and guide him through the
dark places that lie ahead.

11
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,526
In the light of the Seven,
I now proclaim Tommen

12
00:02:18,577 --> 00:02:21,412
of the House Baratheon
First of His Name

13
00:02:21,446 --> 00:02:24,198
King of the Andals
and the First Men

14
00:02:24,249 --> 00:02:27,084
and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

15
00:02:30,205 --> 00:02:32,089
Long may he reign!

16
00:02:32,124 --> 00:02:34,125
All: — Long may he reign!

17
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:36,794
(cheering)

18
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:45,886
Special day.

19
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:56,230
(crowd chatting)

20
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:06,574
Your Grace.

21
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,411
Your Grace.

22
00:03:34,353 --> 00:03:36,520
— Your Grace.
— Your Grace.

23
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:54,155
Your Grace.

24
00:03:56,808 --> 00:03:59,176
There he is.

25
00:03:59,211 --> 00:04:01,379
Long may he reign.

26
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,214
Long may he reign.

27
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,520
He sits the throne
like he was born to it.

28
00:04:09,554 --> 00:04:13,224
Yes. He wasn't,
though, was he?

29
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:15,776
No, he wasn't.

30
00:04:21,283 --> 00:04:23,701
You still mourn for Joffrey?

31
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:25,903
He was my husband.
My king.

32
00:04:25,954 --> 00:04:28,072
He would have been
your nightmare.

33
00:04:31,576 --> 00:04:34,328
Your Grace, I feel–

34
00:04:34,413 --> 00:04:36,514
You knew exactly what he was.

35
00:04:36,548 --> 00:04:39,133
I did, too.

36
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:40,618
You never love
anything in the world

37
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:43,054
the way you love
your first child.

38
00:04:44,956 --> 00:04:47,258
Doesn't matter what they do.

39
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:52,680
And what he did, it shocked me.

40
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:57,268
Do you think I'm easily shocked?

41
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,702
No.

42
00:04:58,737 --> 00:05:02,139
The things he did shocked me.

43
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:10,448
He's only a boy.

44
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:12,950
A good boy.
A decent boy.

45
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:14,869
He always has been.

46
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,089
<i>Who was the last</i>
<i>decent king, I wonder?</i>

47
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:20,007
He could be the first man
who sits on that throne

48
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,793
in 50 years
to actually deserve it.

49
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:26,931
It would be some
consolation, wouldn't it?

50
00:05:26,965 --> 00:05:30,000
For all the horror
that put him there.

51
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:37,241
He will need help...

52
00:05:38,894 --> 00:05:40,611
if he's going to rule well.

53
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:42,613
He has you.

54
00:05:42,647 --> 00:05:45,232
A mother is not enough.

55
00:05:46,618 --> 00:05:49,820
You're still interested
in being queen, I take it?

56
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:51,655
Oh.

57
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:53,741
After all
that's happened–

58
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:59,830
it sounds strange,
I know, but I am–

59
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:02,299
I haven't even given
any thought to it,

60
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:04,084
what comes next.

61
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:07,338
It would be a great
honor, of course.

62
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,474
But I will have to speak
to my father about it.

63
00:06:12,144 --> 00:06:14,845
Yes, speak to your father.

64
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:17,765
I'll speak to mine.

65
00:06:22,237 --> 00:06:25,906
We may be faced with an alarming
number of weddings soon.

66
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:27,658
(chuckles)

67
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:29,693
I won't even know
what to call you.

68
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:32,530
Sister?

69
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,450
Or Mother?

70
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:39,003
Hmm.

71
00:06:40,021 --> 00:06:42,573
King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.

72
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:46,026
Murdered at his own wedding.

73
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:49,430
Barristan:<i> And we have taken the
Meereenese navy, Your Grace.</i>

74
00:06:49,464 --> 00:06:51,682
The Second Sons took
the Meereenese navy.

75
00:06:51,716 --> 00:06:53,717
Who told you to take the navy?

76
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:55,886
No one.

77
00:06:55,888 --> 00:06:58,389
So why did you do it?

78
00:06:58,391 --> 00:07:00,441
I heard you liked ships.

79
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:06,063
How many ships?

80
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:07,364
93, Your Grace.

81
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,732
How many men can they carry?

82
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:11,652
9,300, not counting sailors.

83
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:13,621
Would that be enough
to take King's Landing?

84
00:07:13,655 --> 00:07:15,489
The Lannisters have more.

85
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,908
Barristan: — <i>They've been fighting
Joffrey's wars for years.</i>

86
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,743
They're tired, dispersed.

87
00:07:19,794 --> 00:07:22,079
<i>And now their king is dead.</i>

88
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:25,716
8,000 Unsullied,
2,000 Second Sons

89
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,252
<i>sailing into Blackwater Bay</i>

90
00:07:28,254 --> 00:07:31,055
<i>and storming the gates</i>
<i>without warning.</i>

91
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:36,677
It's hard to say.
It could be enough.

92
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:40,264
But we're not fighting to make
you queen of King's Landing.

93
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:43,267
10,000 men
can't conquer Westeros.

94
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:44,969
The old houses
will flock to our queen

95
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:46,570
when she crosses the Narrow Sea.

96
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:49,406
The old houses will flock to
whichever side they think will win,

97
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:51,525
as they always have.

98
00:07:53,662 --> 00:07:55,829
There's other news.

99
00:07:55,864 --> 00:07:57,615
From Yunkai.

100
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:01,035
Without the Unsullied
to enforce your rule,

101
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:03,954
<i>the Wise Masters have</i>
<i>retaken control of the city.</i>

102
00:08:03,956 --> 00:08:07,007
<i>They've reenslaved the
freedmen who stayed behind</i>

103
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:09,176
and sworn to take
revenge against you.

104
00:08:10,795 --> 00:08:12,596
And in Astapor,

105
00:08:12,631 --> 00:08:15,349
the council you installed
to rule over the city

106
00:08:15,383 --> 00:08:18,469
has been overthrown
by a butcher named Cleon

107
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,855
<i>who's declared himself</i>
<i>«His Imperial Majesty.»</i>

108
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:25,809
Please leave me.

109
00:08:30,982 --> 00:08:33,117
Not you, Jorah.

110
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,082
It appears my liberation
of Slaver's Bay

111
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:50,134
isn't going quite as planned.

112
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:54,054
You could sail for Westeros

113
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:56,090
and leave it all behind.

114
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:57,808
A boy sits on the Iron Throne.

115
00:08:57,842 --> 00:09:01,011
A boy many believe to be a
bastard with no right to it.

116
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:03,897
They've never been
more vulnerable.

117
00:09:03,932 --> 00:09:07,351
You counseled me against
rashness once in Qarth.

118
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:09,987
I didn't listen.

119
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:12,156
That all worked out well.

120
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,325
(chuckles)

121
00:09:19,014 --> 00:09:21,782
How can I rule seven kingdoms

122
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,535
if I can't control Slaver's Bay?

123
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:28,589
Why should anyone trust me?

124
00:09:28,673 --> 00:09:31,208
Why should anyone follow me?

125
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:32,726
<i>You're a Targaryen.</i>

126
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:34,795
You're the Mother of Dragons.

127
00:09:36,648 --> 00:09:39,216
I need to be more than that.

128
00:09:45,473 --> 00:09:50,394
I will not let those I have
freed slide back into chains.

129
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:53,397
I will not sail for Westeros.

130
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:55,432
What, then?

131
00:09:56,868 --> 00:09:59,336
I will do what queens do.

132
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:04,575
I will rule.

133
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:41,945
Pull up your hood.

134
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:46,283
A memorable shade.

135
00:10:47,535 --> 00:10:49,169
But how would they know?

136
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:52,673
You know what kind of stories
poor men enjoy the most?

137
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:55,626
Ones about rich girls
they'll never meet.

138
00:11:00,348 --> 00:11:02,516
Is this the only way
into the Eyrie?

139
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,718
The mountains are impassable.

140
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:06,303
If you want to get to the Eyrie,

141
00:11:06,354 --> 00:11:08,222
you need to go through
the Bloody Gate.

142
00:11:08,273 --> 00:11:11,725
It doesn't matter how
large your army is,

143
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:14,445
if you attack this gate,
you do it on this road,

144
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:16,480
three men abreast

145
00:11:16,482 --> 00:11:19,066
and get slaughtered like goats.

146
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:22,069
The first Lords of the
Vale didn't have much,

147
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,654
but they had these mountains

148
00:11:23,705 --> 00:11:25,656
and they knew how to use them.

149
00:11:25,658 --> 00:11:28,408
And the fortress they built
here has never been overcome.

150
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,211
Not once in 1,000 years.

151
00:11:31,246 --> 00:11:33,997
Know your strengths,
use them wisely,

152
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:37,417
and one man can be worth 10,000.

153
00:11:42,574 --> 00:11:44,374
Knight: — Who would
pass the Bloody Gate?

154
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:47,678
Lord Petyr Baelish
and his niece Alayne.

155
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:53,400
Stand to.

156
00:11:53,434 --> 00:11:56,069
— Stand to!
— Stand to!

157
00:11:57,522 --> 00:11:58,856
Welcome back, Lord Baelish.

158
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:03,410
<i>(gate clanking)</i>

159
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:29,520
<i>(door opens)</i>

160
00:12:29,554 --> 00:12:31,355
Uncle Petyr!

161
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:35,859
Littlefinger: — <i>My lord.</i>

162
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,567
Oh.

163
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:47,821
I have brought you a gift.

164
00:12:52,243 --> 00:12:53,994
Lord Baelish.

165
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:56,747
— My lady.
— Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.

166
00:12:56,798 --> 00:12:59,416
A beautiful gift
for a beautiful boy.

167
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:02,135
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Lady Arryn.

168
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,670
My name is Al–

169
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:06,173
Oh, do take down
that hood, child.

170
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:08,258
Don't you think know
who you are?

171
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:11,144
<i>You think I'd let my intended</i>

172
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:13,146
leave the Eyrie
on urgent business

173
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:15,816
without knowing
what that business was?

174
00:13:17,268 --> 00:13:21,154
I let him go so he could
bring you here to me.

175
00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:27,194
My flesh and blood.

176
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,114
It's wonderful
to meet you, Aunt Lysa.

177
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:33,450
You mustn't call me that
in front of anyone else.

178
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:34,618
Of course.
I understand.

179
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,253
No one can know you're here.

180
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:38,372
It would put us in a very
precarious position.

181
00:13:38,423 --> 00:13:40,007
I would never say a thing.

182
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,593
The Lannisters
want to destroy us.

183
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:44,544
They've been trying for years.

184
00:13:44,596 --> 00:13:46,630
<i>Now they know</i>
<i>what it feels like.</i>

185
00:13:46,632 --> 00:13:50,467
Mummy said they killed your mother and
they chopped off your brother's head.

186
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,689
They did, and my father's.

187
00:13:55,723 --> 00:13:58,308
They killed my father,
too, with poison.

188
00:13:59,777 --> 00:14:02,446
I wanted to make the little
Lannister baby man fly,

189
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,648
but Mother said I couldn't.

190
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:06,483
Make him fly?

191
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:08,568
Through the Moon Door.

192
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:12,873
(giggles)

193
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:15,392
Lysa: — <i>And on top of
everything else,</i>

194
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:17,961
they made you marry
that filthy troll.

195
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:20,163
They did.
They made us both.

196
00:14:20,214 --> 00:14:21,581
Lord Tyrion didn't want to.

197
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:23,533
Lysa: — <i>I don't believe
that for a moment.</i>

198
00:14:23,568 --> 00:14:25,585
Did he force himself on you?

199
00:14:25,637 --> 00:14:27,337
No.

200
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:28,889
— We never–
— Lysa:<i> Good.</i>

201
00:14:28,923 --> 00:14:32,309
Robin, this is
your cousin Sansa.

202
00:14:32,343 --> 00:14:34,511
But you're not to call
her Sansa in front of anyone

203
00:14:34,562 --> 00:14:36,363
but Uncle Petyr and myself.
Do you understand?

204
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:38,815
Sansa, this is my son Robin.

205
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:41,985
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Robin.

206
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,354
Robin, show Sansa
to her chamber.

207
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:46,573
Take the back stairs.

208
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,528
Go.
We'll speak soon.

209
00:15:00,455 --> 00:15:02,372
What took you so long?

210
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:05,375
Arranging for the ascension
of King Tommen I,

211
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:09,046
extricating Sansa,
getting her here alive.

212
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:12,883
She's here. We've spent more than
enough time on her for one evening.

213
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:17,104
Let's get married tonight.

214
00:15:17,188 --> 00:15:19,439
Ought we not...

215
00:15:19,474 --> 00:15:22,559
inform the Lords of the
Vale about the ceremony?

216
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:24,478
There's only one
Lord of the Vale.

217
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:26,363
The others can all hang.

218
00:15:26,397 --> 00:15:28,815
Lurking and simpering
on the stairs like buzzards

219
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:32,285
the moment my husband died,
trying to get their claws in me.

220
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,820
I do think that
we could wait until–

221
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:36,206
I'm done waiting, Petyr.

222
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,575
We had our wedding night
many years ago.

223
00:15:38,626 --> 00:15:40,711
Or don't you remember?

224
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:43,714
Like it was yesterday.

225
00:15:43,748 --> 00:15:47,918
What wife would do for you
the things I've done for you?

226
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,804
What wife would trust you
the way I've trusted you?

227
00:15:50,838 --> 00:15:53,673
When you gave me those drops

228
00:15:53,725 --> 00:15:56,143
and told me to pour
them into Jon's wine,

229
00:15:56,177 --> 00:15:57,644
my husband's wine–

230
00:15:57,678 --> 00:16:00,847
when you told me
to write a letter to Cat

231
00:16:00,898 --> 00:16:03,233
telling her it was
the Lannisters–

232
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:06,069
(moans)

233
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,447
The deed is done.

234
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:20,117
Faded into nothing.

235
00:16:20,168 --> 00:16:23,120
Only speaking of it
can make it real.

236
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:28,175
Tonight it is, then.

237
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:30,377
(laughs)

238
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:34,631
Let me bathe and dress
for the occasion.

239
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:38,101
Once I'm presentable, I'll call
on the septon immediately.

240
00:16:44,942 --> 00:16:47,027
I'm warning you.

241
00:16:47,061 --> 00:16:51,148
I'm going to scream when my
husband makes love to me.

242
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,367
I'm going to scream so loud,

243
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:57,487
they'll hear me clear
across the Narrow Sea.

244
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:02,659
<i>(Lysa screaming)</i>

245
00:17:04,462 --> 00:17:07,214
<i>(grunting, moaning)</i>

246
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:11,384
<i>(screaming)</i>

247
00:17:13,921 --> 00:17:16,673
<i>(moaning, screaming continues)</i>

248
00:17:22,446 --> 00:17:25,782
When will the wedding
take place in your mind?

249
00:17:25,817 --> 00:17:27,517
As soon as decency permits.

250
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:31,555
After we've allowed Tommen the
appropriate time to mourn his brother

251
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:34,324
and Margaery
to mourn her husband.

252
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:36,827
— A fortnight?
— That seems reasonable.

253
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:39,863
No jugglers,
no jousting dwarves,

254
00:17:39,865 --> 00:17:43,200
no 77-course meals.

255
00:17:45,336 --> 00:17:47,637
And your wedding to Loras?

256
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,257
Shortly after Tommen's.

257
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,676
— Shortly?
— A fortnight.

258
00:17:53,761 --> 00:17:55,962
I know you don't like them.

259
00:17:56,013 --> 00:17:58,415
I didn't like your husband.

260
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:00,650
Used to pat me
on the back a lot.

261
00:18:00,685 --> 00:18:02,285
I didn't trust him.

262
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,321
We had that in common.

263
00:18:04,355 --> 00:18:07,958
You don't need to make formal
alliances with people you trust.

264
00:18:07,992 --> 00:18:10,610
Then whom can we trust?

265
00:18:11,896 --> 00:18:14,397
Ourselves alone.

266
00:18:16,784 --> 00:18:18,902
The Tyrells

267
00:18:18,953 --> 00:18:21,571
are our only true rivals

268
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:23,323
in terms of resources

269
00:18:23,374 --> 00:18:26,576
and we need them on our side.

270
00:18:26,627 --> 00:18:29,045
Robert wasn't particularly rich.

271
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,299
Robert had me funding him.

272
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,585
Wars swallow gold
like a pit in the earth.

273
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:38,972
I suppose that explains why we
did so well in the last one.

274
00:18:39,006 --> 00:18:43,059
Do you know how much gold was mined
in the Westerlands this past year?

275
00:18:43,094 --> 00:18:44,227
Haven't a clue.

276
00:18:44,262 --> 00:18:45,929
Go on, your best guess.

277
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,765
Pounds, tons, ounces?

278
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:51,268
Doesn't matter.
The answer is the same.

279
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,937
That can't be.

280
00:18:53,988 --> 00:18:57,023
Our last working mine
ran dry three years ago.

281
00:18:58,276 --> 00:19:00,160
Then how do we pay for anything?

282
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,612
The crown owes
the Iron Bank of Braavos

283
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:04,281
a tremendous amount of money.

284
00:19:04,283 --> 00:19:05,916
How much?

285
00:19:07,335 --> 00:19:09,085
A tremendous amount.

286
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:13,290
There must be someone
at the Iron Bank

287
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:15,759
you can speak to,
come to some arrangement.

288
00:19:15,793 --> 00:19:17,544
The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank.

289
00:19:17,595 --> 00:19:19,179
There is no someone.

290
00:19:19,213 --> 00:19:21,798
Someone does work there.
It is comprised of people.

291
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:23,934
And a temple
is comprised of stones.

292
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:26,886
One stone crumbles
and another takes its place.

293
00:19:26,938 --> 00:19:31,558
And the temple holds its form
for 1,000 years or more.

294
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:35,195
That's what the Iron Bank is: a temple.

295
00:19:35,229 --> 00:19:38,448
We all live in its shadow
and almost none of us know it.

296
00:19:39,984 --> 00:19:41,985
You can't run from them.
You can't cheat them.

297
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:44,754
You can't sway them
with excuses.

298
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:48,425
If you owe them money and you
don't want to crumble yourself,

299
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:50,910
you pay it back.

300
00:19:50,962 --> 00:19:52,746
Vesting the Tyrells in the crown

301
00:19:52,797 --> 00:19:54,581
will help a great deal
in this respect.

302
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:58,435
It's for the good of the
family, I understand that.

303
00:20:01,872 --> 00:20:04,090
I'm not sure my brothers do.

304
00:20:07,845 --> 00:20:11,431
I know you're building
a strong case against Tyrion.

305
00:20:11,482 --> 00:20:14,651
<i>And as a mother,</i>
<i>that is your right.</i>

306
00:20:14,685 --> 00:20:19,189
But as a judge, I cannot
discuss the trial with you.

307
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:21,358
I respect that.

308
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:26,029
We don't need to discuss it.

309
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:32,002
The Lannister legacy is the
only thing that matters.

310
00:20:32,036 --> 00:20:35,205
You've started wars
to protect this family.

311
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:37,540
Turned your back on Jaime

312
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:40,643
for refusing to
contribute to its future.

313
00:20:40,678 --> 00:20:43,913
What does Tyrion deserve

314
00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:46,499
for lighting
that future on fire?

315
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,445
Arya: — <i>Joffrey.</i>

316
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:00,647
Cersei.

317
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:02,649
Walder Frey.

318
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,934
Meryn Trant.

319
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:07,771
<i>Tywin Lannister.</i>

320
00:21:07,805 --> 00:21:09,906
The Red Woman.

321
00:21:09,908 --> 00:21:12,292
Beric Dondarrion.

322
00:21:12,326 --> 00:21:15,412
<i>Thoros of Myr.</i>

323
00:21:15,414 --> 00:21:17,380
<i>Ilyn Payne.</i>

324
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:19,249
The Mountain.

325
00:21:19,251 --> 00:21:21,217
Would you shut up?

326
00:21:21,252 --> 00:21:24,637
I can't sleep
until I say the names.

327
00:21:24,672 --> 00:21:28,308
The names of every
fucking person in Westeros?

328
00:21:29,393 --> 00:21:31,177
Only the ones I'm going to kill.

329
00:21:31,228 --> 00:21:33,012
(chuckles)

330
00:21:33,064 --> 00:21:35,598
Hate's as good a thing
as any to keep a person going.

331
00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:38,184
Better than most.

332
00:21:39,603 --> 00:21:41,738
We come across my brother,

333
00:21:41,772 --> 00:21:45,241
maybe we can both cross
a name off our list.

334
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:51,030
If he were here right now,
what would you do?

335
00:21:58,956 --> 00:22:00,957
I'd tell him to shut the fuck up

336
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:03,126
so I can get some sleep.

337
00:22:06,597 --> 00:22:09,099
Go on, get it over with,

338
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:11,718
your list of doomed men.

339
00:22:13,604 --> 00:22:15,855
I'm almost done.

340
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:18,024
Only one name left.

341
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:20,777
Go on.

342
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:30,653
The Hound.

343
00:22:37,711 --> 00:22:38,962
Thank you.

344
00:22:38,996 --> 00:22:41,047
Your mother always had a
sweet tooth, you know?

345
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:42,632
— Really?
— Oh, yes.

346
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,835
At suppertime, she would go
straight for honey cakes,

347
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:47,554
candied almonds, custard.

348
00:22:47,588 --> 00:22:49,255
Anything sweet.

349
00:22:49,306 --> 00:22:50,840
Eventually, your grandfather

350
00:22:50,842 --> 00:22:53,426
had to assign a septa
to watch her at meals.

351
00:22:53,477 --> 00:22:56,012
Cat was the firstborn
daughter after all.

352
00:22:56,063 --> 00:22:58,014
It was important
that she remain desirable

353
00:22:58,065 --> 00:22:59,682
so Father could arrange
a good match for her

354
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:02,402
and she was starting to get fat.

355
00:23:02,436 --> 00:23:05,855
My mother fat?

356
00:23:07,825 --> 00:23:10,076
She never let me have my pudding

357
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,861
until I'd finished
all my proper food.

358
00:23:11,912 --> 00:23:15,281
This is before she married your
father and moved to the North.

359
00:23:15,332 --> 00:23:18,918
By the time you were born, your
father's austerity had become hers.

360
00:23:18,953 --> 00:23:22,005
Marriage changes people.

361
00:23:24,675 --> 00:23:26,709
I didn't mean for you to stop.

362
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,545
Go on, enjoy them.

363
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,717
How do you like them?

364
00:23:34,768 --> 00:23:36,769
They're delicious.

365
00:23:39,306 --> 00:23:42,141
Where did you get the lemons?
You can't grow them up here.

366
00:23:42,193 --> 00:23:43,810
Oh, gods, no.

367
00:23:43,861 --> 00:23:46,980
Petyr had three crates brought
all the way from King's Landing.

368
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:48,898
He knew you liked lemon cakes.

369
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:50,733
He's so kind.

370
00:23:50,735 --> 00:23:52,735
He really cares for you.

371
00:23:52,786 --> 00:23:55,705
Think where you'd
be without him.

372
00:23:55,739 --> 00:23:58,074
In their clutches
and tried for murder.

373
00:23:59,243 --> 00:24:02,128
Yes.
I'm very lucky.

374
00:24:02,162 --> 00:24:03,746
He feels responsible for you.

375
00:24:03,797 --> 00:24:05,381
Oh, I know he does.
I'm so grateful.

376
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,250
Why?

377
00:24:07,301 --> 00:24:10,086
Why does he feel
responsible for you?

378
00:24:11,138 --> 00:24:13,006
Well, I'm half Tully.

379
00:24:13,057 --> 00:24:15,592
— He loved your family so much.
— Loved your mother.

380
00:24:15,643 --> 00:24:17,594
— No.
— That's what you wanted to say.

381
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:19,062
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.
He's married to you.

382
00:24:19,096 --> 00:24:21,180
Your mother never
loved him. Never.

383
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:24,150
Cat always went straight
for the sweetest thing.

384
00:24:24,184 --> 00:24:27,237
The most obvious thing.
Your Uncle Brandon.

385
00:24:27,271 --> 00:24:30,240
Your handsome, arrogant,
cruel Uncle Brandon.

386
00:24:30,274 --> 00:24:32,775
He almost killed Petyr
in a duel.

387
00:24:32,826 --> 00:24:35,028
And your mother
loved him anyway.

388
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:38,698
And now Petyr is risking
his life to save you,

389
00:24:38,749 --> 00:24:41,451
the daughter of a woman
who didn't love him

390
00:24:41,453 --> 00:24:44,504
no more than those
whores in his brothels.

391
00:24:44,538 --> 00:24:47,457
— Has he told you about them?
— No.

392
00:24:47,508 --> 00:24:50,293
He hasn't told you about the vile
things they do with their bodies?

393
00:24:50,344 --> 00:24:52,512
The vile things they let
him do with their bodies?

394
00:24:52,546 --> 00:24:54,764
— <i> No, never.</i>
— Are you pregnant?

395
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,185
What? No, I told you.
Lord Tyrion and I never–

396
00:24:59,219 --> 00:25:01,104
I wasn't asking about Tyrion.

397
00:25:01,138 --> 00:25:03,189
What have you let Petyr
do with your body?

398
00:25:03,223 --> 00:25:05,775
— Aunt Lysa, no, I–
— Your young, pretty body.

399
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:08,478
— Nothing. I'm a virgin.
— Don't lie to me.

400
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,814
You're hurting me.

401
00:25:11,816 --> 00:25:13,316
I'll know if you lie.

402
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:16,152
I'm a virgin, I swear it.

403
00:25:16,203 --> 00:25:17,987
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.

404
00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:19,989
All he says is that I'm stupid.

405
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,991
I'm a stupid little girl
with stupid dreams

406
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:23,910
who never learns
and I'm a terrible liar,

407
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:25,282
so I should always
tell the truth.

408
00:25:25,296 --> 00:25:27,547
And I swear to you that
he has never touched me.

409
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:30,049
— Not once, not ever.
— Shh. Shh. Shh.

410
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:33,670
It's all right.

411
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:35,838
It will all be all right.

412
00:25:35,889 --> 00:25:37,173
You'll be a widow soon.

413
00:25:37,175 --> 00:25:39,592
They'll execute that dwarf
for murdering the king

414
00:25:39,643 --> 00:25:41,844
and you'll be free
to marry Robin.

415
00:25:41,895 --> 00:25:44,013
You'll be the Lady of the Vale.

416
00:25:44,015 --> 00:25:46,432
Hmm.

417
00:25:51,939 --> 00:25:54,490
(horse whinnies)

418
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:01,614
(grunting)

419
00:26:08,422 --> 00:26:10,707
Didn't they teach you
how to ride a horse?

420
00:26:10,758 --> 00:26:14,260
Yes, my lady, when I was young.

421
00:26:14,294 --> 00:26:16,295
There wasn't much call for
it with Lord Tyrion, though.

422
00:26:16,347 --> 00:26:18,931
He preferred litters.

423
00:26:18,966 --> 00:26:21,684
Perhaps you should
have stayed with him.

424
00:26:27,691 --> 00:26:29,976
It's not going to be
a pleasant journey for you.

425
00:26:30,027 --> 00:26:33,446
It could take weeks to get to the
Wall, depending on the weather.

426
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,148
That's a long way off.

427
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:38,151
Well, Lady Sansa's
brother's at Castle Black.

428
00:26:38,202 --> 00:26:40,737
If I were her,
that's where I'd go.

429
00:26:40,788 --> 00:26:43,322
Feel free to stop at any point.

430
00:26:43,374 --> 00:26:46,242
Never, my lady.
I'm your squire.

431
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:48,828
I've made it this far in
the world without a squire.

432
00:26:48,879 --> 00:26:50,296
I don't see why I need one now.

433
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,081
All knights have
squires, my lady.

434
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:53,416
<i>I'm not a knight.</i>

435
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:56,586
And I'm not a slaver, either.
I don't own you.

436
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,755
I swore an oath, my lady.

437
00:26:58,757 --> 00:27:01,307
I am releasing you
from that oath.

438
00:27:04,344 --> 00:27:06,562
That means you could leave.

439
00:27:06,597 --> 00:27:08,347
I know.

440
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:10,900
What do you think
will happen if you leave?

441
00:27:12,102 --> 00:27:14,771
They'll say I wasn't
a very good squire.

442
00:27:14,773 --> 00:27:17,774
(horse nickers)

443
00:27:17,776 --> 00:27:19,942
(whinnies)

444
00:28:09,326 --> 00:28:12,628
— The hell you doing?
— Practicing.

445
00:28:12,663 --> 00:28:15,882
— What, ways to die?
— No one's going to kill me.

446
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:17,834
They will if you nance
around like that.

447
00:28:17,885 --> 00:28:20,336
That's no way to fight.

448
00:28:20,387 --> 00:28:23,339
It's not fighting.
It's water dancing.

449
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,475
Dancing?

450
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:27,727
Maybe you ought
to put on a dress.

451
00:28:29,513 --> 00:28:31,514
Who taught you that shite?

452
00:28:31,565 --> 00:28:34,150
The greatest swordsman
who ever lived.

453
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,022
Syrio Forel, the First Sword
to the Sealord of Braavos.

454
00:28:40,073 --> 00:28:41,491
Braavos.
(scoffs)

455
00:28:41,525 --> 00:28:43,359
Greasy-haired little
bastard, I bet.

456
00:28:43,361 --> 00:28:44,744
They all are.

457
00:28:44,778 --> 00:28:46,362
What do you know about anything?

458
00:28:46,364 --> 00:28:48,531
I bet his hair is greasier
than Joffrey's cunt.

459
00:28:48,582 --> 00:28:50,583
— It was not.
— Was? He dead?

460
00:28:50,617 --> 00:28:51,534
— Yes.
— How?

461
00:28:51,585 --> 00:28:53,452
— He was killed.
— Who by?

462
00:28:53,504 --> 00:28:55,288
Meryn Trant.
That's why Ser Meryn–

463
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:57,039
Meryn Trant?

464
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:00,259
The greatest swordsman who ever lived
killed by Meryn fucking Trant?

465
00:29:00,294 --> 00:29:02,261
— He was outnumbered.
— Any boy whore with a sword

466
00:29:02,296 --> 00:29:04,213
could beat three Meryn Trants.

467
00:29:04,264 --> 00:29:06,682
Syrio didn't have a sword.
Or armor. Just a stick.

468
00:29:06,717 --> 00:29:08,885
The greatest swordsman who ever
lived didn't have a sword?

469
00:29:08,887 --> 00:29:11,387
(laughs)

470
00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:13,222
All right.
You have a sword.

471
00:29:13,224 --> 00:29:14,690
Let's see what he taught you.

472
00:29:14,725 --> 00:29:17,560
Go on, do it for
your Braavosi friend.

473
00:29:18,896 --> 00:29:20,813
Dead like all the rest
of your friends.

474
00:29:22,065 --> 00:29:24,233
(grunts)

475
00:29:31,775 --> 00:29:35,578
Your friend's dead
and Meryn Trant's not

476
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,330
'cause Trant had armor

477
00:29:37,381 --> 00:29:39,715
and a big fucking sword.

478
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,253
(scoffs)

479
00:29:53,063 --> 00:29:56,315
<i>(bird calling)</i>

480
00:30:09,947 --> 00:30:11,864
Your Grace.

481
00:30:11,915 --> 00:30:14,584
Prince Oberyn.
Writing letters?

482
00:30:14,618 --> 00:30:17,370
A poem, actually.

483
00:30:18,622 --> 00:30:20,623
May I show you the gardens?

484
00:30:20,674 --> 00:30:23,759
I couldn't very well
refuse a royal escort.

485
00:30:23,794 --> 00:30:25,962
No, you couldn't.

486
00:30:28,131 --> 00:30:30,466
I didn't realize
you were a poet.

487
00:30:30,468 --> 00:30:33,135
Not a very good one.

488
00:30:33,137 --> 00:30:35,221
For your paramour?

489
00:30:35,272 --> 00:30:37,607
For one of my daughters.

490
00:30:37,641 --> 00:30:40,059
You have several, don't you?

491
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,444
Eight.

492
00:30:41,478 --> 00:30:43,145
Eight?

493
00:30:43,196 --> 00:30:45,448
Eight daughters?

494
00:30:45,482 --> 00:30:47,316
The fifth is difficult.

495
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,986
I named her after
my sister Elia.

496
00:30:49,988 --> 00:30:51,654
Beautiful name.

497
00:30:51,656 --> 00:30:53,572
Yes.

498
00:30:53,624 --> 00:30:56,659
But I can't say it
without turning sad.

499
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,629
And after I turn sad,

500
00:30:59,663 --> 00:31:01,831
I grow angry.

501
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:04,583
Perhaps that's why
she's difficult.

502
00:31:04,635 --> 00:31:07,720
The gods love their
stupid jokes, don't they?

503
00:31:07,754 --> 00:31:10,006
Which joke is that?

504
00:31:10,057 --> 00:31:12,425
You're a prince of Dorne.

505
00:31:12,476 --> 00:31:14,677
A legendary fighter.

506
00:31:14,728 --> 00:31:16,896
A brilliant man feared
throughout Westeros.

507
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,849
But you could not
save your sister.

508
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,319
I'm a Lannister.
Queen for 19 years.

509
00:31:23,353 --> 00:31:25,488
Daughter of the most
powerful man alive.

510
00:31:25,522 --> 00:31:28,190
But I could not save my son.

511
00:31:28,192 --> 00:31:30,660
What good is power

512
00:31:30,694 --> 00:31:33,696
if you cannot protect
the ones you love?

513
00:31:33,698 --> 00:31:35,531
We can avenge them.

514
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:38,034
Yes, we can avenge them.

515
00:31:39,753 --> 00:31:42,254
You really believe
Tyrion murdered your son?

516
00:31:43,507 --> 00:31:45,508
I know he did.

517
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,995
We will have a trial and
we will learn the truth.

518
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,381
We'll have a trial, anyway.

519
00:31:56,553 --> 00:32:00,056
I haven't seen my
daughter in over a year.

520
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:02,058
The last time I saw her,

521
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,394
she was swimming with two of
my girls in the Water Gardens.

522
00:32:05,396 --> 00:32:08,230
Laughing in the sun.

523
00:32:10,233 --> 00:32:12,234
I want to believe that.

524
00:32:12,236 --> 00:32:15,071
I want to believe she's happy.

525
00:32:15,122 --> 00:32:17,707
You have my word.

526
00:32:17,741 --> 00:32:20,576
We don't hurt
little girls in Dorne.

527
00:32:21,995 --> 00:32:25,047
Everywhere in the world,
they hurt little girls.

528
00:32:34,424 --> 00:32:36,225
Would you bring her
a gift for me?

529
00:32:38,095 --> 00:32:39,895
<i>I wasn't there for her name day.</i>

530
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,264
I don't know when
I'll see her again.

531
00:32:42,266 --> 00:32:44,734
Anything at all.

532
00:32:45,986 --> 00:32:48,020
The best shipwrights
in King's Landing

533
00:32:48,071 --> 00:32:50,189
have been working
on it for months.

534
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,659
Myrcella loves the open water.

535
00:32:53,693 --> 00:32:57,830
Oberyn: — <i>I will have it sailed
down to Sunspear for her.</i>

536
00:32:59,282 --> 00:33:01,217
Please tell her...

537
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,955
her mother misses her very much.

538
00:33:15,048 --> 00:33:17,433
Podrick: — Oh, no, no, no.

539
00:33:17,467 --> 00:33:19,385
No, no, no, no.

540
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,854
Hells.

541
00:33:25,225 --> 00:33:27,026
Gods.

542
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,981
Did you remove the skin?

543
00:33:34,067 --> 00:33:35,618
No, my lady.

544
00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:37,620
Have you ever cooked
a rabbit before?

545
00:33:37,654 --> 00:33:39,989
No, my lady.

546
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,826
Did you ever cook
anything for Lord Tyrion?

547
00:33:43,828 --> 00:33:46,796
No, my lady.

548
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,547
That was the cooks.

549
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:51,417
(groans)

550
00:34:05,932 --> 00:34:07,266
What are you doing?

551
00:34:07,317 --> 00:34:09,518
I'm helping you with your armor.

552
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:12,822
I've been removing my own armor for
quite some time, thank you very much.

553
00:34:30,624 --> 00:34:33,259
What exactly did you do
for Lord Tyrion?

554
00:34:33,293 --> 00:34:36,846
I brought him his meals and cleared
his table when he was finished.

555
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,181
I kept his clothing
and linens clean.

556
00:34:39,216 --> 00:34:42,134
Carried his messages
and returned the replies.

557
00:34:43,937 --> 00:34:45,638
Mostly I poured wine.

558
00:34:45,689 --> 00:34:47,690
Oh.

559
00:34:47,724 --> 00:34:49,558
Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service,

560
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:52,978
did you ever do anything
remotely related to combat?

561
00:34:56,867 --> 00:34:59,535
I killed a man.

562
00:35:02,072 --> 00:35:04,740
Who?

563
00:35:04,742 --> 00:35:06,792
A Kingsguard.

564
00:35:10,664 --> 00:35:14,083
He tried to kill
Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.

565
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,922
How did you kill a Kingsguard?

566
00:35:21,758 --> 00:35:24,476
I pushed a spear through
the back of his head.

567
00:35:36,323 --> 00:35:38,440
Bloody ridiculous.

568
00:35:42,028 --> 00:35:43,779
Help me with these straps.

569
00:35:53,757 --> 00:35:57,042
— (woman whimpering)
— (Rast laughing)

570
00:36:03,016 --> 00:36:04,767
Rast: — Hey.

571
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:06,802
Hey, get up.

572
00:36:07,737 --> 00:36:10,773
— Get up.
— (sobbing)

573
00:36:16,279 --> 00:36:18,647
Man: — <i>That's it lad,
put it inside.</i>

574
00:36:18,698 --> 00:36:20,649
<i>Get the fire going again.</i>
<i>We're all freezing.</i>

575
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,152
Aye. What we need
is a girl there.

576
00:36:23,154 --> 00:36:25,321
I've got to have a piss.

577
00:36:31,795 --> 00:36:34,163
<i>(pigs grunting)</i>

578
00:36:34,165 --> 00:36:36,799
<i>(women whimpering)</i>

579
00:36:38,301 --> 00:36:40,219
Now keep quiet.

580
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,815
(rattles)

581
00:37:04,327 --> 00:37:06,862
(lantern squeaking)

582
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:21,010
(coughs)

583
00:37:21,044 --> 00:37:23,045
You need water.

584
00:37:23,047 --> 00:37:24,763
It doesn't matter.

585
00:37:24,798 --> 00:37:27,816
Of course it matters.

586
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,088
You mustn't let
anything stop you.

587
00:37:35,108 --> 00:37:37,726
They already have stopped me.

588
00:37:37,761 --> 00:37:40,362
No.

589
00:37:42,432 --> 00:37:44,933
You're not here.

590
00:37:50,573 --> 00:37:52,908
You're far from here.

591
00:37:54,844 --> 00:37:57,079
What does that mean?

592
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,882
<i>(crows cawing)</i>

593
00:38:03,136 --> 00:38:05,170
At the hill.

594
00:38:05,221 --> 00:38:07,840
A great weirwood tree.

595
00:38:09,392 --> 00:38:12,811
You've seen it, too.

596
00:38:12,846 --> 00:38:17,066
Meera and I, even Hodor,

597
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,735
we're only here to guide you.

598
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:25,307
He's waiting for you.

599
00:38:27,343 --> 00:38:29,411
We have to find it.

600
00:38:30,547 --> 00:38:33,082
You have to make it.

601
00:38:33,116 --> 00:38:34,716
We will.

602
00:38:35,685 --> 00:38:39,238
This — this isn't
the end.

603
00:38:40,957 --> 00:38:42,524
Not for you.

604
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:45,377
Not yet.

605
00:38:45,428 --> 00:38:47,896
Meera: — <i>How...</i>

606
00:38:47,931 --> 00:38:50,632
will we know the end?

607
00:39:02,529 --> 00:39:04,780
You'll know.

608
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:10,152
<i>(footsteps)</i>

609
00:39:17,243 --> 00:39:19,711
Locke: — <i>Brothers.</i>

610
00:39:19,746 --> 00:39:22,464
You do move quiet.

611
00:39:24,584 --> 00:39:26,835
— How many?
— 11 men.

612
00:39:26,837 --> 00:39:28,720
Most of them already drunk.

613
00:39:28,755 --> 00:39:32,641
No guards posted. They don't seem
to have a care in the world.

614
00:39:32,675 --> 00:39:35,677
We'll carve them up
like walnut pie.

615
00:39:35,728 --> 00:39:38,180
Karl was a top paid
cutthroat in Flea Bottom.

616
00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:40,482
I've seen what
he can do with a knife.

617
00:39:40,517 --> 00:39:42,267
Have you seen what
I can do with a knife?

618
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:44,820
(chuckles)
Not yet.

619
00:39:46,906 --> 00:39:50,526
There's a hut on the west side of the keep.
We should steer clear of it.

620
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,743
Why?

621
00:39:51,778 --> 00:39:54,863
They've got some hounds
chained up inside.

622
00:39:54,914 --> 00:39:58,033
Closer we can get without the
dogs sniffing us, the better.

623
00:39:59,536 --> 00:40:01,870
New moon tonight.

624
00:40:03,873 --> 00:40:06,208
(sighs)
Get some rest.

625
00:40:06,259 --> 00:40:08,877
We move at sundown.

626
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,182
I've always liked
a girl with curls.

627
00:40:13,216 --> 00:40:15,350
A touch of class.

628
00:40:15,385 --> 00:40:17,886
You take whatever's left.

629
00:40:20,857 --> 00:40:22,474
Get her up.

630
00:40:24,694 --> 00:40:25,861
Bran: — <i>Stop.</i>

631
00:40:25,895 --> 00:40:27,529
<i>Stop.</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

632
00:40:27,564 --> 00:40:29,781
Hodor: — <i>Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.</i>

633
00:40:29,816 --> 00:40:32,618
Stop.
Stop!

634
00:40:33,786 --> 00:40:37,039
Hodor:<i> Hodor. Hodor.</i>
Bran:<i> Stop!</i>

635
00:40:37,073 --> 00:40:39,625
— Please.
— <i> Hodor.</i>

636
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:42,911
— Please, get off her!
— Hodor. Hodor.

637
00:40:42,913 --> 00:40:45,247
Please!
Please, leave her alone!

638
00:40:48,051 --> 00:40:50,219
Bran: — <i>Please, stop. Stop.</i>

639
00:40:50,253 --> 00:40:53,505
— <i> What are you doing? Leave her alone!</i>
— <i> Hodor. Hodor.</i>

640
00:40:53,556 --> 00:40:55,057
— <i> No!</i>
— Shh.

641
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:58,093
— Shh, shh, shh.
— (gasping)

642
00:40:58,144 --> 00:41:00,929
— Shh.
— (whimpering)

643
00:41:04,934 --> 00:41:06,935
You've got pretty hair,
don't you?

644
00:41:08,938 --> 00:41:11,940
Now what is a pretty little
highborn girl like you

645
00:41:11,942 --> 00:41:14,910
doing out here in
the deep, dark woods, eh?

646
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:20,332
You left your daddy's castle
looking for trouble, didn't you?

647
00:41:20,366 --> 00:41:22,618
No dresses for you.

648
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,121
You like it rough, don't you?

649
00:41:26,123 --> 00:41:29,458
You like it in
the gutter, don't you?

650
00:41:29,509 --> 00:41:32,844
If you let my sister go,
I can help you.

651
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,214
You can help me?

652
00:41:36,266 --> 00:41:38,634
I can.

653
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:42,304
And how you gonna do that?

654
00:41:44,974 --> 00:41:48,894
I have the sight.
I can see things.

655
00:41:48,945 --> 00:41:50,812
That's very helpful.

656
00:41:50,863 --> 00:41:53,065
Things that haven't
happened yet.

657
00:41:56,986 --> 00:41:58,954
What a fine thing.

658
00:42:02,492 --> 00:42:03,875
A fine thing.

659
00:42:05,628 --> 00:42:08,714
Have you seen what I'm
gonna do to your sister?

660
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:15,270
Have you seen what they're
going to do to your sister?

661
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,474
No.

662
00:42:21,394 --> 00:42:24,096
Don't close your eyes.

663
00:42:29,068 --> 00:42:32,020
I saw you die tonight.

664
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:36,358
I saw your body burn.

665
00:42:36,409 --> 00:42:40,862
I saw the snow fall
and bury your bones.

666
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:46,284
Man: — <i>To arms!</i>

667
00:42:46,336 --> 00:42:49,371
They're here, the Night's Watch.

668
00:42:49,422 --> 00:42:51,757
(men shouting)

669
00:42:57,013 --> 00:42:59,348
(woman screaming)

670
00:43:13,363 --> 00:43:15,063
(screams)

671
00:43:18,651 --> 00:43:20,902
Rescue party is here, lads.

672
00:43:20,904 --> 00:43:22,454
Lady.

673
00:43:22,538 --> 00:43:25,123
— Is Jon with you?
— Aye.

674
00:43:25,158 --> 00:43:27,793
I'll take you to him.

675
00:43:30,246 --> 00:43:32,881
You're Brandon Stark?

676
00:43:37,754 --> 00:43:39,638
— (gasps)
— Hodor. Hodor.

677
00:43:39,672 --> 00:43:42,340
The little crippled lord.
We're going for a ride, boy.

678
00:43:42,392 --> 00:43:44,176
Jon! Jon!

679
00:43:44,227 --> 00:43:48,597
Keep talking and I'll cut
your friends' throats.

680
00:43:48,648 --> 00:43:51,516
Starting with the idiot.
Do you hear?

681
00:43:51,567 --> 00:43:53,685
Do you hear?

682
00:44:06,115 --> 00:44:08,333
Hodor: — <i>Hodor! Hodor!</i>

683
00:44:09,786 --> 00:44:12,170
Hodor. Hodor.

684
00:44:12,205 --> 00:44:13,955
Hodor. Hodor.

685
00:44:16,626 --> 00:44:19,177
<i>Hodor. Hodor.</i>
<i>Hodor.</i>

686
00:44:25,268 --> 00:44:28,470
(grunting)

687
00:44:48,658 --> 00:44:50,659
(choking)

688
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:58,917
(neck cracks)

689
00:45:02,004 --> 00:45:04,005
Hodor.

690
00:45:05,174 --> 00:45:08,727
<i>Hodor, get his knife.</i>
<i>Cut me loose.</i>

691
00:45:09,812 --> 00:45:12,931
— <i> Hodor, get his knife.</i>
— Hodor.

692
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,485
Cut me loose, Hodor.

693
00:45:22,441 --> 00:45:25,610
Jojen and Meera, free them.

694
00:45:25,661 --> 00:45:27,362
<i>Go!</i>

695
00:45:27,364 --> 00:45:30,081
— <i> (swords clanking)</i>
— <i> (men shouting)</i>

696
00:45:30,116 --> 00:45:31,833
Jon.

697
00:45:41,627 --> 00:45:43,545
Jon!

698
00:45:45,631 --> 00:45:47,215
If he sees you, he won't
let you go north.

699
00:45:47,217 --> 00:45:50,268
— He's my brother.
— And wants to protect you.

700
00:45:50,303 --> 00:45:53,138
<i>He'll take you back</i>
<i>to Castle Black.</i>

701
00:45:54,724 --> 00:45:56,775
<i>You have to decide.</i>

702
00:45:56,809 --> 00:45:58,810
Do you want to find
the three-eyed raven?

703
00:46:13,075 --> 00:46:15,126
Bran: — Hodor.
Hodor: — Hodor.

704
00:46:15,161 --> 00:46:17,379
We need to free Summer.

705
00:46:17,413 --> 00:46:20,048
And we need to go.

706
00:46:25,054 --> 00:46:27,305

707
00:46:34,597 --> 00:46:36,598
Lord Snow.

708
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,184
Are you bringing me
back for trial?

709
00:46:41,771 --> 00:46:43,939
We had a good thing here.

710
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:46,858
We were free men.

711
00:46:46,909 --> 00:46:49,027
You'll never be free.

712
00:46:49,078 --> 00:46:51,446
You'll never know
what that's like.

713
00:47:12,602 --> 00:47:15,470
You learn how to fight
in a castle?

714
00:47:18,024 --> 00:47:20,809
(groans)

715
00:47:20,811 --> 00:47:22,777
Some old man
teach you how to stand,

716
00:47:22,812 --> 00:47:24,145
how to parry?

717
00:47:24,196 --> 00:47:25,981
(groans)

718
00:47:28,367 --> 00:47:30,402
How to fight with honor?

719
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:45,300
You know what's
wrong with honor?

720
00:47:45,334 --> 00:47:47,302
(spits)

721
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,975
(grunts)

722
00:47:55,978 --> 00:47:57,812
You.

723
00:48:07,273 --> 00:48:09,491
(gurgling)

724
00:48:18,868 --> 00:48:21,536
(panting)

725
00:48:29,211 --> 00:48:31,763
Are you all right?

726
00:48:34,133 --> 00:48:36,301
Come with me.

727
00:48:36,352 --> 00:48:38,470
Come on.

728
00:48:42,608 --> 00:48:45,310
(grunts)

729
00:48:55,154 --> 00:48:57,372
We lost four brothers?

730
00:48:57,406 --> 00:48:59,407
Five.

731
00:49:02,878 --> 00:49:05,213
What the seven hells
could do that to a man?

732
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:09,667
I count 10 dead mutineers.

733
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:12,921
Locke said there
were 11 of them.

734
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,840
Where's Rast?

735
00:49:15,891 --> 00:49:18,476
<i>(wind howling)</i>

736
00:49:21,564 --> 00:49:24,516
(panting)

737
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:44,252
<i>(crows cawing)</i>

738
00:49:52,094 --> 00:49:53,595
— (roaring)
— (Rast screams)

739
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:02,470
— Here's another.
— Jon.

740
00:50:05,474 --> 00:50:07,442
Jon: — <i>Where in seven hells?</i>

741
00:50:08,644 --> 00:50:09,978
Come here.

742
00:50:13,315 --> 00:50:15,533
(whining)

743
00:50:17,286 --> 00:50:19,537
I missed you, boy.

744
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:25,326
What should we do with this lot?

745
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:32,500
It's not safe for you
here on your own.

746
00:50:32,502 --> 00:50:35,136
Mance Rayder has an army
heading this way

747
00:50:35,171 --> 00:50:37,172
and there's worse out
there than Mance.

748
00:50:39,592 --> 00:50:42,177
Come with us to Castle Black.

749
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:45,597
We can find you work.
Keep you safe.

750
00:50:45,648 --> 00:50:47,849
Meaning all respect, Ser Crow,

751
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,486
Craster beat us and worse.

752
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,989
Your brother crows
beat us and worse.

753
00:50:55,024 --> 00:50:57,192
We'll find our own way.

754
00:50:57,194 --> 00:50:58,776
You want to stay here

755
00:50:58,828 --> 00:51:00,945
in Craster's Keep?

756
00:51:03,782 --> 00:51:05,116
(spits)

757
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:07,118
Burn it to the ground

758
00:51:07,169 --> 00:51:10,038
and all the dead with it.

759
00:51:49,381 --> 00:51:59,286
