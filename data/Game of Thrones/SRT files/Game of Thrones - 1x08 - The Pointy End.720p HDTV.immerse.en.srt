1
00:00:00,336 --> 00:00:02,564
Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke

2
00:00:03,023 --> 00:00:05,005
informing my father
of my victory here.

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,715
And one {\*to Deepwood Motte }to my sister.

4
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:10,053
Inform her that she's to bring
500 men to Winterfell.

5
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:13,763
- When do we sail for King's Landing?
- Soon as I've consolidated my troops.

6
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:16,433
And you lead the fleet
into Blackwater Bay.

7
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:20,687
The fist of the First Men.
Thousands of years ago the{\* First Men}y stood here.

8
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,731
They came here
to get away from something.

9
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,274
{\*And }I don't think it worked.

10
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,568
Do you {\*really }think
I'll let you ship Myrcella off to Dorne?

11
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,778
Dorne is the safest place for her.

12
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:31,448
I want you to know
what it's like to love someone,

13
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,408
to truly love someone

14
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,397
before I take her from you.

15
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,787
You let a halfwit escape
with a cripple?

16
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:39,039
And Rickon, too?{\* The little one?}

17
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,383
Gone, along with the wildling woman.

18
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:43,001
Wait, I know that farm.

19
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,242
- They'll give us some food.
- We can't risk it.

20
00:00:45,604 --> 00:00:47,173
I've been treating your wounded men.

21
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,299
I've already run through the supplies{\* I brought with me}.

22
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,343
You're riding to the Crag
to {\*negotiate }a surrender.

23
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,443
Come with me to the Crag.
Let the Maester show you his stores.

24
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,646
Should have took me{\* while you had the chance}.

25
00:01:04,294 --> 00:01:05,551
They want your head.

26
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:08,158
Old Lord Karstark
doesn't seem to like me.

27
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,279
You strangled his son
with your chains.

28
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,157
- He was in my way.
- You are a man without honor.

29
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,283
{\*Brienne, }Your sword.

30
00:01:18,268 --> 00:01:19,663
You have my dragons?

31
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,166
I'll take you to the House of the Undying
where I have put them.

32
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,583
Your dragons wait for you
in the House of the Undying.

33
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:30,674
I told you what would happen
if you served me loyally

34
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,801
and what would happen
if you did not.

35
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,282
What have you done?

36
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,764
If there are any among you who {\*still }question
whether your {\*new }lord means what he says...

37
00:03:44,086 --> 00:03:45,892
- Rider approaching!
- Open the gate!

38
00:04:14,392 --> 00:04:16,642
Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell.

39
00:04:18,105 --> 00:04:20,505
- Envy isn't attractive.
- What envy?

40
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:23,440
You should be proud
of your brother's achievement.

41
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,475
I took the great castle
of Winterfell with 20 men.

42
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,175
You're a great warrior.
I saw the bodies above your gates.

43
00:04:30,873 --> 00:04:34,522
Which one gave you the tougher fight,
the cripple or the six-year-old?

44
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:40,424
I treated the Stark boys with honor
and they repaid me with treachery.

45
00:04:40,674 --> 00:04:43,742
You treated them with honor
by butchering them?

46
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,162
- Before I had to kill them{\* , I treated them}...
- You seized their home{\* , as is your right}.

47
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,789
We're Ironborn;
We take what we need.

48
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:50,789
Exactly.

49
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:54,148
Then you made them prisoners in
their home and they ran away.

50
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,684
Is that treachery?
I'd call it bravery.

51
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,814
They made me a promise...

52
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:03,137
Your {\* little boy }prisoners made you a promise
and you got mad when they broke it?

53
00:05:04,265 --> 00:05:05,555
Are you the dumbest cunt{\* alive}?

54
00:05:06,148 --> 00:05:07,933
- Don't call me a...
- A cunt.

55
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:11,583
A dumb cunt who killed
the only two Starks in Winterfell.

56
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:14,439
You know how valuable
those boys were?

57
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,104
If I hadn't killed them, the
Northerners would think me weak.

58
00:05:17,354 --> 00:05:18,504
You are weak.

59
00:05:19,176 --> 00:05:21,154
- I'm warning you.
- And you're stupid.

60
00:05:23,052 --> 00:05:24,152
Go on, then,

61
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:25,699
warn me.

62
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:31,978
You haven't brought enough men.

63
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:34,414
How am I supposed to defend
Winterfell with just this lot?

64
00:05:34,664 --> 00:05:35,627
You're not.

65
00:05:36,107 --> 00:05:38,973
I've come to bring you home.
- Father wants a word.

66
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:41,800
Is this a joke?
Winterfell is the heart of the North.

67
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,130
Aye, it is,
hundreds of miles from the sea.

68
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:47,389
We're islanders, baby brother.

69
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,894
Had you forgotten that?

70
00:05:49,144 --> 00:05:51,194
Our power comes from our ships.

71
00:05:51,992 --> 00:05:55,355
And now that you'vedecorated your walls
with the bodies of the Stark boys,

72
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,505
every man in the North
wants to see you hanged.

73
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,550
- When Robb Stark finds out...
- He won't{\ find out}.

74
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:05,568
We've killed all the ravens.
We have all the horses.

75
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:08,785
I've taken Winterfell.

76
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,746
And I

77
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,546
will keep Winterfell.

78
00:06:15,804 --> 00:06:16,751
Leave us.

79
00:06:30,535 --> 00:06:32,185
Theon, you're my blood.

80
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,741
We both loved our mother.

81
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:39,314
We both endured our father.

82
00:06:41,474 --> 00:06:43,615
Come home with me.
Don't die here alone.

83
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:45,465
I don't intend to die.

84
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:53,204
You were a terrible baby,
do you know that?

85
00:06:55,265 --> 00:06:57,615
Bawling all the time, never sleeping.

86
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:01,785
And one night you just
wouldn't shut up,

87
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:03,885
screaming like a dying pig.

88
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:09,016
I walked over to your crib,
I looked down at you.

89
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:11,519
I wanted to strangle you.

90
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,686
And you looked up at me
and you stopped screaming.

91
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:18,786
You smiled at me.

92
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,044
Don't die so far from the sea.

93
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:44,001
I've brought you a present,
Lord of Bones.

94
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,249
I already got one crow.
Don't need two.

95
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:50,451
Mance will want to question this one.

96
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:53,268
Knows all about where the crows
are and what they're planning.

97
00:07:53,518 --> 00:07:56,879
The Halfhand knows more.
This one is just a little boy.

98
00:07:57,387 --> 00:07:58,186
Gut him.

99
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,027
He could have killed me
half a dozen times.

100
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:02,565
And now he wishes he did.

101
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:03,858
Gut him.

102
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,948
He's a bastard of Winterfell,
Ned Stark's son.

103
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,866
Mance will want him.

104
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,537
What does Mance want
with a dead man's bastard?

105
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:17,955
I don't know.

106
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:21,125
I think he'll want
to decide for himself.

107
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:31,010
He runs, I'll chop his balls off.

108
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,679
He runs, I'll do it meself.

109
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:43,147
We're even now, Jon Snow.

110
00:08:57,131 --> 00:08:58,481
I couldn't do it.

111
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:02,052
- I had the sword at her neck{\* , I just couldn't}...
- I know.

112
00:09:03,163 --> 00:09:04,190
The others?

113
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,588
When you didn't come back,
we went looking for you.

114
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,560
We found your tracks fast enough.

115
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:12,555
But they found us
before we found you.

116
00:09:13,863 --> 00:09:15,097
They died because of me.

117
00:09:16,854 --> 00:09:18,539
See that it wasn't for nothing.

118
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,910
Come on, on your feet, now.

119
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:31,017
Is she beautiful?

120
00:09:32,476 --> 00:09:33,926
I've never met her.

121
00:09:34,738 --> 00:09:36,223
What's her name?

122
00:09:36,473 --> 00:09:39,412
Frey, I suppose.
I don't know her first name.

123
00:09:40,944 --> 00:09:42,944
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

124
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:50,672
- And you're marrying her for a bridge?
- An important bridge.

125
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:54,523
It was before they killed my father.

126
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:58,248
I still thought I could march south
and rescue him in time,

127
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,267
but only if I crossed that bridge.

128
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:06,953
When I speak to people from the North,
they all loved your father.

129
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,127
He was the best man I ever met.

130
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,961
I know children always think
that about their fathers, but--

131
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:18,242
Children do not always think that
about their fathers, believe me.

132
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,400
He once told me that being
a Lord is like being a father,

133
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:27,974
except you have thousands of children
and you worry about all of them.

134
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:31,228
The farmers plowing
the fields are yours to protect.

135
00:10:31,478 --> 00:10:34,452
The charwomen scrubbing the floors,
yours to protect.

136
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:36,952
The soldiers you order into battle.

137
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,458
He told me he woke
with fear in the morning

138
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,841
and went to bed
with fear in the night.

139
00:10:44,787 --> 00:10:46,337
I didn't believe him.

140
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,767
I asked him,

141
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:52,567
"how can a man be brave
if he's afraid?"

142
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,823
"That is the only time
a man can be brave," he told me.

143
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,993
I wish I could have met him.

144
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:05,039
He would have liked you.

145
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:12,089
Most Lords worry more about their gold
and their glory than the charwomen {\* scrubbing their floors}.

146
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,606
He didn't care much
about gold or glory.

147
00:11:14,856 --> 00:11:16,039
And you?

148
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:19,593
You think I'm fighting this war so
they'll sing songs about me?

149
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,223
I want to go home.

150
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:26,686
- I want {\* the men following me} my men to go home.
- Then why don't you?

151
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:30,339
Because we'll never be safe until
the Lannisters are defeated.

152
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:34,402
- And because I believe in justice.
- Chopping of Joffrey's head, you mean.

153
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,238
That would be a start.

154
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,584
Your Grace, Milady.
The Kingslayer,

155
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,587
- he escaped in the night.
- How?

156
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,090
How?!

157
00:12:01,144 --> 00:12:02,725
Tell me this isn't true.

158
00:12:07,654 --> 00:12:08,853
Why?

159
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:13,161
- For the girls.
- You betrayed me.

160
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:18,106
You knew I would not allow it
and you did it anyway.

161
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:22,834
Bran and Rickon
are captives in Winterfell.

162
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:25,904
Sansa and Arya are captives
in King's Landing.

163
00:12:26,154 --> 00:12:28,636
I have five children,
and only one of them is free.

164
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:32,309
I lost one son fighting
by your son's side.

165
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:36,065
I lost another to the Kingslayer,
strangled with a chain.

166
00:12:37,184 --> 00:12:41,260
You commit treason
because your children are prisoners?

167
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,149
I would carve out my heart

168
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,618
and offer it to the Father
if he would let my sons

169
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:49,945
wake from their graves
and step into a prison cell.

170
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:51,623
I grieve for your sons, My Lord.

171
00:12:51,873 --> 00:12:54,182
I don't want your grief.
I want my vengeance.

172
00:12:54,922 --> 00:12:56,928
And you stole it from me.

173
00:12:58,897 --> 00:13:02,108
Killing Jaime Lannister
would not buy life for your children,

174
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:05,853
but returning him to King's Landing
may buy life for mine.

175
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:09,664
Jaime Lannister
has played you for a fool.

176
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:12,945
You've weakened our position.

177
00:13:13,195 --> 00:13:14,835
You've brought discord into our camp.

178
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:17,867
And you did it all behind my back.

179
00:13:21,637 --> 00:13:23,552
Make sure she's guarded
day and night.

180
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:26,526
How many men did we send
in pursuit of the Kingslayer?

181
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:27,794
40, Your Grace.

182
00:13:28,044 --> 00:13:30,976
Send another 40
with our fastest horses.

183
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:51,348
Damn.

184
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:57,878
You're much uglier in daylight.
What's your name?

185
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,968
I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock,
son of Tywin.

186
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:09,097
A captive Knight has a right
to know his captor's identity.

187
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,204
Brienne of Tarth.

188
00:14:11,454 --> 00:14:13,008
Tarth, Tarth, Tarth.

189
00:14:13,258 --> 00:14:15,938
Crescent moons and starbursts.

190
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:20,881
Lord... Selwyn Tarth, your father.

191
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:25,182
Do you have any brothers
and sisters, My Lady?

192
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,253
It's a long way to King's Landing.

193
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:31,104
Might as well
get to know one another.

194
00:14:31,806 --> 00:14:33,158
Have you known many men?

195
00:14:33,408 --> 00:14:34,457
I suppose not.

196
00:14:34,876 --> 00:14:36,198
Women?

197
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:37,293
Horses?

198
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,338
I didn't mean to give offense{\*, My Lady}.
Forgive me.

199
00:14:41,806 --> 00:14:44,336
Your crimes are past forgiveness,
Kingslayer.

200
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:46,051
Why do you hate me so much?

201
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:48,721
- Have I ever harmed you?
- You've harmed others...

202
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,962
those you were sworn to protect,
the weak, the innocent.

203
00:14:53,212 --> 00:14:56,236
Has anyone ever told you
you're as boring as you are ugly?

204
00:14:56,486 --> 00:14:58,950
You will not provoke me to anger.

205
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,486
I already have.
Look at you.

206
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:03,235
You're ready to chop my head off.

207
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:05,972
Do you think you could?

208
00:15:06,222 --> 00:15:08,126
Do you think you could
beat me in a fair fight?

209
00:15:08,376 --> 00:15:09,860
I've never seen you fight.

210
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,786
The answer is no.

211
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:15,399
There are three men in the kingdoms
who might have a chance against me.

212
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:16,874
You're not one of them.

213
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:20,309
All my life men like you
have sneered at me.

214
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,092
And all my life I've been knocking
men like you into the dust.

215
00:15:23,342 --> 00:15:25,810
If you're so confident,
unlock my chains.

216
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,580
Let's see what happens.

217
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,346
Do you take me for an idiot? In.

218
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:35,708
I took you for a fighter,

219
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:39,472
a man... pardon... woman of honor.

220
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,738
Was I wrong?

221
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:43,720
You're afraid.

222
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,951
Maybe one day
we'll find out, Kingslayer.

223
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:06,342
King's Landing will fall an hour
after Stannis lands his force.

224
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,521
It's not too late for {\*King }Joffrey and Cersei
and the court to ride west to safety.

225
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:14,858
Surrender the Iron Throne?

226
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:18,263
Better than seeing their heads
mounted on the city gates.

227
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:20,771
Stannis will execute them all.

228
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,014
No, a king who runs
will not be king for long.

229
00:16:24,203 --> 00:16:26,610
He's a Lannister.
He'll stand and fight.

230
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:32,116
Stannis, two days from the capital
and the wolf at my doorstep.

231
00:16:32,641 --> 00:16:35,812
The scouts assure us Robb Stark
remains north of Ashemark.

232
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:39,455
The last time the scouts
assured us of Stark's movement,

233
00:16:39,705 --> 00:16:41,208
he lured us into a trap.

234
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:45,498
Which is why my son is his prisoner.

235
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:51,218
Too close to Casterly Rock.

236
00:16:52,981 --> 00:16:56,243
He sent a splinter force
to recapture Winterfell.

237
00:16:57,073 --> 00:16:58,892
The Greyjoys
have done us a great favor.

238
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:02,021
Stark won't risk
marching on Casterly Rock

239
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,659
until he's at full force.

240
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:06,025
He's a boy
and he's never lost a battle.

241
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,904
He'll risk anything at any time

242
00:17:10,937 --> 00:17:13,282
because he doesn't know
enough to be afraid.

243
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:22,925
We'll ride at nightfall.

244
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:26,045
I want a full night's march
before he knows we're on the move.

245
00:17:26,475 --> 00:17:29,865
Clegane, you'll maintain
a garrison here at Harrenhal.

246
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,087
Track down this brotherhood
and destroy them.

247
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:38,472
The girl has proven
herself a good servant.

248
00:17:38,722 --> 00:17:40,288
She'll stay on with you.

249
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,106
See that he doesn't get
drunk in the evenings.

250
00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:48,359
He's poor company when he's sober,
but he's better at his work.

251
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,959
You've got some questions to answer.

252
00:17:58,209 --> 00:17:59,889
Who killed Ser Amory?

253
00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:01,729
- I don't know!
- Give me the name.

254
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:03,499
Take this one out for the crows.

255
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,870
I told you, I don't know.

256
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:08,758
Please.

257
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:13,953
Look, it's Yoren's little cunt.
Used to be a boy, now it's a girl.

258
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:16,971
Where's Jaqen?

259
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,250
Don't care.

260
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,892
Where's your stick now, bitch?

261
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,917
I promised to fuck you with it.

262
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:26,132
Time to kill some wolves.

263
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,616
You need sour cherries
to make it right.

264
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,786
And the secret is you dry the stones,
and then you break them with a mallet.

265
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,978
That's where the real flavor is.
You crush 'em up real fine.

266
00:18:44,228 --> 00:18:46,542
And {\*then }when you're finished,
you sprinkle them over the piecrust.

267
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,411
- Where's Jaqen?
- How would I know?

268
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:51,338
I need him now.
Lord Tywin's marching tonight.

269
00:18:51,975 --> 00:18:53,006
You need him?

270
00:18:53,524 --> 00:18:54,680
He's helping me.

271
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,969
- I saw him.
- Where?

272
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,265
Where?

273
00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:04,268
They went riding out the gates
a few hours ago.

274
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,029
On patrol.
Let go of my ears.

275
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:14,486
What do you want with him anyway?

276
00:19:30,124 --> 00:19:32,212
Mance is gonna march on the Wall.

277
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:36,345
When he does, one brother inside his army
will be worth 1,000 fighting against it.

278
00:19:36,595 --> 00:19:38,463
- They'll never trust me.
- They might...

279
00:19:38,713 --> 00:19:40,464
- If you do what needs to be done.
- What?

280
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:43,181
How does it feel
knowing those men all died

281
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:45,859
so you could skip through the snow
with your little savage girl?

282
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:46,908
I didn't.

283
00:19:47,158 --> 00:19:49,563
I should have known better,
trusting a traitor's bastard.

284
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,284
He's not yours to kill, crow.

285
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,286
Do you have to do that here?

286
00:20:23,668 --> 00:20:25,510
I like to keep me hands clean.

287
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:28,819
Yes, but do you have to do it here?

288
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,142
- {\*You should }Start wearing the gold cloak.
- I don't want to wear a gold cloak.

289
00:20:41,392 --> 00:20:43,273
You're commander of the City Watch.

290
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,057
- You shouldn't be dressed like a {\*common }sellsword.
- A cloak slows you down in a fight,

291
00:20:47,307 --> 00:20:49,285
makes it hard to move quietly.

292
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:53,051
And the gold catches the light, so
you're nice and easy to spot at night.

293
00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:56,157
Well, you're not sneaking
through alleyways any longer.

294
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,028
- You're supposed to stand out.
- We had a deal.

295
00:20:59,278 --> 00:21:02,678
- And wearing a {\*gold }cloak wasn't part of it.
- Fine, fine.

296
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,157
No gold cloak.

297
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,932
- What?
- What?

298
00:21:16,182 --> 00:21:18,318
What? What?
Why are you staring at me?

299
00:21:19,752 --> 00:21:22,823
You don't want me cleaning me nails.
You don't want me looking your way.

300
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:24,803
Why am I here?

301
00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:28,026
To help me plan the defense
of King's Landing.

302
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,371
Stannis will be here any day.

303
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:35,919
And one of these
explains how to beat him?

304
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:40,444
"An History
of the Great Sieges of Westeros"

305
00:21:40,694 --> 00:21:43,103
by Archmaester "Shevelathin."

306
00:21:44,134 --> 00:21:45,384
"Shevelatesh."

307
00:21:45,634 --> 00:21:46,635
"Chevalteesh."

308
00:21:50,449 --> 00:21:53,205
I'd swap all your books
for a few good archers.

309
00:21:53,455 --> 00:21:55,395
My Lord Hand, Commander.

310
00:21:55,645 --> 00:21:56,982
I must compliment you

311
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:00,277
on the Gold Cloaks' performance
these last few weeks.

312
00:22:01,178 --> 00:22:04,113
Did you know there has been
a marked drop in thievery?

313
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,021
I did not know.

314
00:22:08,218 --> 00:22:10,662
And how did you accomplish
this marked drop in thievery?

315
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:13,874
Me and the lads rounded up
all the known thieves.

316
00:22:15,336 --> 00:22:16,660
For questioning?

317
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:17,937
Uh, no.

318
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,447
It's {\*just }the unknown thieves
we need to worry about now.

319
00:22:21,697 --> 00:22:24,121
- We talked about this.
- Aye, we talked about it.

320
00:22:24,753 --> 00:22:27,101
Have you ever been
in a city under siege?

321
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:29,776
Maybe this part's not in your books.

322
00:22:30,464 --> 00:22:32,459
See, it's not the fighting
that kills most people.

323
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:35,828
It's the starving.
Food's worth more than gold.

324
00:22:36,078 --> 00:22:39,229
Noble ladies sell their diamonds
for a sack of potatoes.

325
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:43,153
Things get bad enough,
the poor start eating each other.

326
00:22:44,011 --> 00:22:46,201
The thieves, they love a siege.

327
00:22:46,451 --> 00:22:49,221
Soon as the gates are sealed,
they steal all the food.

328
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:52,079
By the time it's all over,
they're the richest men in town.

329
00:22:53,924 --> 00:22:55,484
Given the circumstances, My Lord,

330
00:22:55,734 --> 00:22:58,571
I believe extreme measures
are warranted.

331
00:23:01,393 --> 00:23:04,019
"The Great Sieges of Westeros."

332
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:05,669
Thrilling subject.

333
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:10,575
Shame Archmaester Ch'vyalthan
wasn't a better writer.

334
00:23:15,134 --> 00:23:17,106
Stannis knows King's Landing.

335
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:20,618
He knows where the walls
are strongest

336
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:24,374
and he knows which gates are weakest.

337
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:28,657
The Mud Gate.

338
00:23:30,192 --> 00:23:31,994
A good ram
will batter it down in minutes

339
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,173
and it's only 50 yards
from the water.

340
00:23:34,423 --> 00:23:36,077
That's where he'll land.

341
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:39,918
And if Stannis does attack
the Mud Gate, what is our plan?

342
00:23:41,982 --> 00:23:44,847
- We could throw books at his men.
- We don't have that many books.

343
00:23:45,097 --> 00:23:46,633
We don't have that many men, either.

344
00:23:47,876 --> 00:23:49,425
What do we have?

345
00:23:51,398 --> 00:23:52,556
Pig shit.

346
00:24:11,424 --> 00:24:13,285
I'm not cut out
for this sort of work.

347
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:16,998
I always imagined meself
doing something much worse.

348
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:19,958
We're digging latrine pits
at the end of the world.

349
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,210
I can't imagine anything much worse.

350
00:24:23,012 --> 00:24:25,017
You lack imagination.

351
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,385
Where do you think Jon is right now?

352
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:32,387
He went off with the Halfhand.
He didn't come back.

353
00:24:32,858 --> 00:24:34,431
A betting man would go with dead.

354
00:24:36,067 --> 00:24:37,512
He's not dead.

355
00:24:37,762 --> 00:24:39,728
No, Jon's a great fighter.

356
00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:42,981
Well, he's better than me
and a lot better than you.

357
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:46,101
He's got a Valyrian steel sword.

358
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:48,570
So did his father.

359
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,240
And Qhorin Halfhand
is the greatest ranger alive.

360
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,135
Great rangers never
get old is the problem.

361
00:24:54,385 --> 00:24:55,917
Shit ones neither.

362
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,404
It's them in the middle
that last a long time.

363
00:25:05,286 --> 00:25:07,226
What in seven hells is that?

364
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:25,466
The First Men made these marks.

365
00:25:25,716 --> 00:25:27,016
Help me with it.

366
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:41,873
Look.

367
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:47,838
If you find something
you're not supposed to,

368
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:51,711
best thing to do is pretend
you've never seen it.

369
00:25:51,961 --> 00:25:53,615
That's a Night's Watch cloak.

370
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,804
It's been here a long time.

371
00:26:02,793 --> 00:26:05,230
- Must be Dragonglass.
- Dragonglass?

372
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,997
The Maesters call it Obsidian.

373
00:26:10,342 --> 00:26:11,820
Why would a brother hide it here?

374
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,068
I expect it's 'cause
he wanted somebody to find it.

375
00:26:21,469 --> 00:26:23,360
Mind where you're going.

376
00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:33,350
I'm sorry.
I'll...

377
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,765
- Where were you?
- A man has patrol duty.

378
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:40,631
Tywin Lannister was right here
and now he's gone.

379
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:42,528
A girl owes one more name.

380
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:44,811
The Red God demands it.
Give the man a name.

381
00:26:46,658 --> 00:26:49,191
How long after I give you the name
does it take you to kill someone?

382
00:26:50,546 --> 00:26:53,644
A minute, an hour, a month.

383
00:26:55,043 --> 00:26:56,489
Death is certain,

384
00:26:57,889 --> 00:26:58,976
the time is not.

385
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:01,304
He's taking his army
to attack my brother.

386
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:03,354
I need him dead right now.

387
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,964
This a man cannot do.

388
00:27:07,453 --> 00:27:08,919
You promised you'd help me.

389
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,047
Help was not promised, lovely girl.
Only death.

390
00:27:12,806 --> 00:27:15,008
There must be others.
Give a name, any name.

391
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:17,895
And you'll kill them?

392
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:20,100
Anybody?

393
00:27:23,674 --> 00:27:26,278
By the seven New Gods
and the Old Gods beyond counting,

394
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:27,604
I swear it.

395
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:32,180
All right.

396
00:27:38,185 --> 00:27:39,375
Jaqen H'ghar.

397
00:27:46,637 --> 00:27:48,333
A girl gives a man his own name?

398
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,002
- That's right.
- Gods are not mocked.

399
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,963
- This is no joking thing.
- I'm not joking.

400
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:55,173
A man can go kill himself.

401
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,864
- Un-name me.
- No.

402
00:27:57,114 --> 00:27:58,051
Please?

403
00:28:01,191 --> 00:28:02,691
I'll un-name you.

404
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,684
- Thank you.
- If you help me and my friends escape.

405
00:28:08,102 --> 00:28:09,725
This would require
more than one life.

406
00:28:09,975 --> 00:28:12,732
- This is not part of our bargain.
- Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.

407
00:28:13,637 --> 00:28:14,734
A girl lacks honor.

408
00:28:23,127 --> 00:28:25,711
If I do this thing, a girl must obey.

409
00:28:25,961 --> 00:28:27,217
A girl will obey.

410
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:32,892
A girl and her friends will walk
through the gate at midnight.

411
00:28:37,957 --> 00:28:39,343
Thank you, Podrick.

412
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:47,706
Odd little boy.

413
00:28:48,555 --> 00:28:50,520
I have a certain sympathy
for odd little boys.

414
00:28:51,546 --> 00:28:52,981
You and Varys both.

415
00:28:55,131 --> 00:28:56,731
Excellent lamprey pie.

416
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,137
Were you slaving away
in the kitchen all day?

417
00:29:01,036 --> 00:29:02,574
I hear Joffrey plans on fighting.

418
00:29:03,338 --> 00:29:04,931
An inspiration for the troops.

419
00:29:05,181 --> 00:29:06,745
The young king in his shining armor

420
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,358
fighting to defend the capital
against the wicked old rebel.

421
00:29:09,608 --> 00:29:10,908
He's only a boy.

422
00:29:11,546 --> 00:29:13,731
Younger boys are off
fighting his war.

423
00:29:14,907 --> 00:29:17,531
- He's not ready.
- What is he, 17?

424
00:29:18,284 --> 00:29:20,759
- Remember Jaime at 17?
- Better than you.

425
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:23,802
Some men have a gift
for this sort of thing,

426
00:29:24,052 --> 00:29:25,209
some don't.

427
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,557
His place is not on the battlefield.

428
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,435
It's not on the throne, either,
sadly for all of us.

429
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:37,173
Do you think I'm an idiot?

430
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,570
- No, I'd say you possess above average intelligence.
- You shipped off my only daughter.

431
00:29:41,854 --> 00:29:44,908
And now you want to send my
eldest son to the battlefield to die.

432
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,246
He'll have his Kingsguard
protecting him.

433
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:51,414
He has the finest armor gold can buy.
He needs to be out there.

434
00:29:52,136 --> 00:29:55,043
The men will fight more fiercely
seeing their king fighting beside them

435
00:29:55,747 --> 00:29:58,630
instead of hiding behind
his mother's skirts.

436
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,620
Any dessert?

437
00:30:01,644 --> 00:30:04,161
Do you know why
Varys is so dangerous?

438
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:07,361
Because he has thousands
of spies in his employ.

439
00:30:07,757 --> 00:30:10,395
Because he knows everything
we do before we do it.

440
00:30:10,645 --> 00:30:12,018
Because he doesn't have a cock.

441
00:30:12,738 --> 00:30:13,561
Neither do you.

442
00:30:16,054 --> 00:30:17,904
Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.

443
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:22,696
You, on the other hand,
are as big a fool as every other man.

444
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:26,455
That little worm between your legs
does half your thinking.

445
00:30:26,705 --> 00:30:28,284
It's not that little.

446
00:30:35,276 --> 00:30:36,543
Why are you smiling?

447
00:30:37,215 --> 00:30:38,615
Because I'm happy.

448
00:30:39,253 --> 00:30:40,259
And why are you happy?

449
00:30:44,895 --> 00:30:46,968
Because I have your little whore.

450
00:30:50,626 --> 00:30:52,642
I thought you preferred blondes.

451
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,168
Such a droll little fellow.

452
00:30:54,418 --> 00:30:56,062
Tell me, have you
married this one yet?

453
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:57,956
No?

454
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,887
Oh, good.
Father will be so pleased.

455
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:02,908
Why do you care who I fuck?

456
00:31:03,158 --> 00:31:05,561
Because a Lannister
always pays her debts.

457
00:31:05,811 --> 00:31:07,323
You stole my only daughter,

458
00:31:07,573 --> 00:31:09,033
you plot to have Joffrey killed.

459
00:31:09,283 --> 00:31:10,618
This is madness.

460
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:12,669
Stannis will be here in days.
You need me.

461
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:15,019
For what?
Your skill in battle?

462
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:19,544
Pretty thing, your whore.

463
00:31:20,283 --> 00:31:23,465
Lovely body.
The bruises will heal in time.

464
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,642
Where did you find her?

465
00:31:27,892 --> 00:31:30,138
Varys isn't the only one
who hears whispers.

466
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:32,882
Really, a Lannister lion necklace?

467
00:31:34,189 --> 00:31:36,297
You need to hide your secret whores
more carefully.

468
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,880
You've forgotten the most
important thing about whores.

469
00:31:41,814 --> 00:31:43,849
Well, you're the expert.
Tell me.

470
00:31:45,564 --> 00:31:47,014
You don't buy them;

471
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,439
You only rent them.

472
00:31:50,137 --> 00:31:52,400
You're usually a better liar,
baby brother.

473
00:31:53,892 --> 00:31:55,292
This one you like.

474
00:31:56,533 --> 00:31:58,183
You like her very much.

475
00:31:59,723 --> 00:32:00,835
Could it be love?

476
00:32:02,092 --> 00:32:04,607
Don't worry, she'll be treated
gently enough...

477
00:32:04,857 --> 00:32:06,240
unless Joffrey is hurt.

478
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,105
And then every wound
he suffers she'll suffer, too.

479
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,428
And if he dies,

480
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:14,463
there isn't a man alive
who could devise

481
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:17,239
a more painful death
for your little cunt.

482
00:32:20,627 --> 00:32:23,824
And how do I know you
haven't killed her already?

483
00:32:24,074 --> 00:32:25,318
Would you like to see her?

484
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:26,815
I thought you might.

485
00:32:27,065 --> 00:32:29,618
Ser Mandon, bring in
my brother's whore.

486
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:04,056
I'm sorry they hurt you.

487
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,800
You must be brave.

488
00:33:13,281 --> 00:33:15,285
I promise I will free you.

489
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:18,580
Don't forget me.

490
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,351
Never.

491
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:40,816
I will hurt you for this.

492
00:33:41,802 --> 00:33:45,189
A day will come when you
think you're safe and happy

493
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:48,860
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth.

494
00:33:50,512 --> 00:33:51,904
And you will know the debt is paid.

495
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:54,379
Get out.

496
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,150
I've been waiting all night.

497
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:14,969
What is wrong?

498
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:16,971
You're beautiful.

499
00:34:25,226 --> 00:34:26,360
Then why do you look sad?

500
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:37,349
- We have to be more careful.
- Don't be afraid.

501
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,993
I can take care of myself.

502
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:42,146
There are people who want to hurt me.

503
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:44,582
I know.
I won't let them.

504
00:34:45,067 --> 00:34:47,306
I'll cut off their faces.
I will.

505
00:34:52,318 --> 00:34:54,550
I would kill for you.
Do you know that?

506
00:34:55,947 --> 00:34:58,221
I expect I'll have to
before this is over.

507
00:35:02,282 --> 00:35:03,559
You're mine.

508
00:35:05,363 --> 00:35:06,896
I'm yours.

509
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:09,072
Promise me.

510
00:35:13,293 --> 00:35:15,652
I'm yours, and you are mine.

511
00:35:27,798 --> 00:35:29,056
Still no word?

512
00:35:30,013 --> 00:35:31,859
We've sent a dozen ravens.

513
00:35:32,234 --> 00:35:33,684
None have returned.

514
00:35:35,137 --> 00:35:38,840
My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell.
Once he captures the castle--

515
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:41,280
Theon has my brothers.
If we storm the castle--

516
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,580
He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.

517
00:35:45,428 --> 00:35:48,250
They're his only hope of escaping
the North with his head.

518
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,206
Send word to your son.

519
00:35:53,766 --> 00:35:54,902
Any Ironborn who surrender

520
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:58,019
will be allowed to return
safely to their homes.

521
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:01,463
A touch of mercy is a virtue,
Your Grace.

522
00:36:01,713 --> 00:36:03,119
- Too much--
- Any ironborn

523
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,747
with the exception of Theon Greyjoy.

524
00:36:06,888 --> 00:36:08,427
He betrayed our cause.

525
00:36:09,382 --> 00:36:10,632
He betrayed me.

526
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:14,505
And we will hunt him down
no matter where he runs.

527
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,340
{\I expect }His countrymen will turn on him

528
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,842
the minute they hear the offer.

529
00:36:21,185 --> 00:36:23,765
Your pardon, My Lord.
Your Grace.

530
00:36:37,387 --> 00:36:38,471
How are you?

531
00:36:40,504 --> 00:36:41,581
How am I?

532
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:43,994
I've had to arrest my mother.

533
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:46,300
The Lannisters have my sisters.

534
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,498
The man I considered
my closest friend

535
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:51,417
has seized my home and my brothers.

536
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,166
{\*I'm fighting a war and }I don't know
if I should march South or North.

537
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:57,596
I'm sorry.
It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.

538
00:36:59,352 --> 00:37:00,421
Forgive me.

539
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:02,553
You're being kind.

540
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:05,292
- I have no right.
- You have every right.

541
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,352
- You're a King.
- That's not the{\* kind of} King I want to be.

542
00:37:10,376 --> 00:37:12,688
- What kind do you want to be?
- I don't know.

543
00:37:12,938 --> 00:37:14,607
The good kind.

544
00:37:18,466 --> 00:37:20,093
Most kings grew up as princes.

545
00:37:20,343 --> 00:37:23,489
They spend their whole lives
preparing for the crown.

546
00:37:23,739 --> 00:37:25,967
I was raised to be
Lord of Winterfell.

547
00:37:28,389 --> 00:37:30,081
I was raised
to be a proper little lady,

548
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,994
to play the harp

549
00:37:32,244 --> 00:37:35,708
and dance the latest steps
and recite Valyrian poetry.

550
00:37:36,411 --> 00:37:39,715
- I'd like to hear you play the harp.
- No, you would not.

551
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:48,664
How did you go
from reciting Valyrian poetry

552
00:37:48,914 --> 00:37:50,532
to sawing off men's feet?

553
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,617
When I was 12,

554
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:05,679
my mother and father
went to a wedding.

555
00:38:05,929 --> 00:38:07,452
Weddings in Volantis last for days{\*, you know}.

556
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:11,307
And they left me
with my little brother.

557
00:38:12,907 --> 00:38:17,211
The second afternoon they were gone was
the hottest day in the 3-year summer.

558
00:38:18,024 --> 00:38:21,231
We couldn't bear to be inside,
so we ran down to the Rhoyne.

559
00:38:22,131 --> 00:38:25,040
Every child in Volantis
was in the Rhoyne that day.

560
00:38:26,843 --> 00:38:29,140
The rich, the poor, we were all there,

561
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,310
naked, screaming, racing
to the little islands.

562
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,367
Drummers were playing
for coppers on the East Bank.

563
00:38:39,537 --> 00:38:41,064
I was treading water,

564
00:38:42,365 --> 00:38:43,719
talking to a friend

565
00:38:44,334 --> 00:38:46,871
when I realized
I hadn't seen my brother.

566
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:49,766
I called his name.

567
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,511
Then I started screaming his name.

568
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,294
And then I saw him

569
00:38:58,405 --> 00:38:59,852
floating facedown.

570
00:39:02,108 --> 00:39:05,723
My heart just stopped.
I was...

571
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,461
I dragged him from the water.

572
00:39:13,759 --> 00:39:17,200
My friend helped me, I think.
I don't even remember.

573
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,878
He was so little.

574
00:39:23,692 --> 00:39:26,058
Then we pulled him
onto the riverbank...

575
00:39:27,968 --> 00:39:30,051
and I screamed at him

576
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:31,574
and I shook him

577
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:34,108
and he was dead.

578
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,480
Just dead.

579
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,710
A man ran over.

580
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,354
He had a fish tattoo on his face.

581
00:39:50,443 --> 00:39:53,124
In Volantis the slaves have tattoos

582
00:39:53,374 --> 00:39:55,935
so you know what they are
without having to talk to them.

583
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,416
And this man
worked on a fishing boat.

584
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:01,125
And he pushed me out of the way.

585
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,567
You have to understand,

586
00:40:04,203 --> 00:40:07,175
for a slave to push a highborn girl...

587
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:10,299
that's death for the man,
a terrible death.

588
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:13,882
But he pushed me out of the way

589
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:19,464
and he started pressing
on my brother's chest

590
00:40:19,714 --> 00:40:22,920
again and again and again

591
00:40:23,856 --> 00:40:26,876
until my brother spat out

592
00:40:27,445 --> 00:40:28,758
half of the Rhoyne

593
00:40:29,909 --> 00:40:30,847
and cried out.

594
00:40:31,097 --> 00:40:34,018
And the man cradled his head
and told him to be calm.

595
00:40:41,285 --> 00:40:43,404
I decided two things that day.

596
00:40:43,654 --> 00:40:46,944
I would not waste my years
planning dances and masquerades

597
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,043
with the other noble ladies.

598
00:40:50,129 --> 00:40:52,740
And when I came of age...

599
00:40:54,255 --> 00:40:56,667
I would never live
in a slave city again.

600
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:05,860
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

601
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,774
You told me of your problems
and I've blathered on.

602
00:41:09,024 --> 00:41:10,259
I don't want to marry the Frey girl.

603
00:41:15,595 --> 00:41:16,974
I don't want you to marry her.

604
00:41:20,969 --> 00:41:22,694
But you needed that bridge.

605
00:41:25,707 --> 00:41:27,109
I hope it's a {\*very }beautiful bridge.

606
00:42:34,116 --> 00:42:36,429
The sour cherries
was all crushed up and ready.

607
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,344
- Shut up.
- Probably in the piecrust by now.

608
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,893
In the oven, the nice warm oven.

609
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,396
Shut up.
What did you bring?

610
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,228
The cheese could be better.

611
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:48,941
{\*I did get }Some nice sausages.

612
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,938
What did he want us
to do about those guards?

613
00:42:52,188 --> 00:42:54,155
{\*He didn't say. }He just said,
"Walk through the gates.

614
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:56,804
What about the guards?

615
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,539
He didn't say anything{\* about the guards}.

616
00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:01,954
What, he left that bit out?
It's a pretty important part{\*, don't you think?}.

617
00:43:02,676 --> 00:43:05,249
- We have to trust him.
- Trust him?

618
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:08,220
You trusted him to fight with us
and you set him free and he ran.

619
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:11,630
- I want to go back to the kitchens.
- Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.

620
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:16,850
Arry, don't.

621
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,096
Away!
Reset!

622
00:43:56,948 --> 00:44:00,179
If the wind holds,
we'll reach King's Landing in a day.

623
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,617
Will it hold?

624
00:44:01,867 --> 00:44:04,116
Can't make promises
for the wind, Your Grace.

625
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,023
I admire you, Ser Davos.

626
00:44:13,273 --> 00:44:16,215
I thank you, Your Grace.
Pleased to hear it.

627
00:44:16,465 --> 00:44:20,301
Some highborn fools call you
Onion Knight and think they insult you.

628
00:44:20,551 --> 00:44:22,602
So you take the onion for your sigil,

629
00:44:22,852 --> 00:44:25,160
sew it on your coat,
fly the onion flag.

630
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:27,289
My son wishes me to change it.

631
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:30,196
Three mermen with tridents,
something like that.

632
00:44:30,696 --> 00:44:33,890
I understand why the older families
look down at me.

633
00:44:34,836 --> 00:44:36,715
Do you?
Why?

634
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:39,666
- My father was a crabber.
- And?

635
00:44:39,916 --> 00:44:43,513
Well, sons of Lords don't like
to break bread with sons of crabbers.

636
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:47,852
- Our hands stink.
- {\*And }Where were th{\*ose Lords}ey when Storm's End starved?

637
00:44:48,445 --> 00:44:51,021
Many fought bravely for your brother.
Many fought for the Mad King.

638
00:44:53,182 --> 00:44:54,859
You defend these men

639
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,810
who insult you behind your back.

640
00:44:57,317 --> 00:44:59,071
Some are happy to do it to my face.

641
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,660
We were forgotten.

642
00:45:01,788 --> 00:45:05,578
Robert and Ned Stark... they were
the heroes, the glorious rebels

643
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,804
marching from battle to battle,

644
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:10,437
liberating towns
from the yoke of the Mad King

645
00:45:10,687 --> 00:45:12,960
while I held Storm's End
with 500 men.

646
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,129
- No one has forgotten{\*, Your Grace}.
- No? Robert did.

647
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,618
He gave Storm's End to Renly{\* after the war}.
Renly never fought a day in his life.

648
00:45:18,868 --> 00:45:20,217
He was only a boy.

649
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,157
Then why'd he give him Storm's End?

650
00:45:25,683 --> 00:45:28,726
First we ate the horses.
We weren't riding anyway,

651
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,117
not with the castle surrounded.

652
00:45:31,367 --> 00:45:33,480
We couldn't feed them,
so fine, the horses.

653
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,676
Then the cats. Never liked cats.
So fine.

654
00:45:36,926 --> 00:45:38,135
I do like dogs.

655
00:45:38,811 --> 00:45:42,323
Good animals. Loyal.
But we ate them. Then the rats.

656
00:45:43,371 --> 00:45:46,160
The night before you slipped through,
I thought my wife was dying.

657
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,787
She couldn't speak anymore,
she was so frail.

658
00:45:50,045 --> 00:45:52,149
And then you made it
through the lines.

659
00:45:52,399 --> 00:45:54,585
Slipped right through in your little
black sailboat with your onions.

660
00:45:55,851 --> 00:45:58,172
And potatoes.
Some salted beef, I believe.

661
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,948
Every man in Storm's End
wanted to kiss you that night.

662
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,528
I was relieved they did not.

663
00:46:05,646 --> 00:46:08,486
Robert told me to hold
Storm's End, so I held it.

664
00:46:10,382 --> 00:46:13,270
Then he told me he was giving it
to Renly, so I gave it up.

665
00:46:13,842 --> 00:46:15,475
Insult or no, I gave it up

666
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:20,194
because Robert was my {\*older }brother, {\*and he was }the King,
and I've always done my duty.

667
00:46:20,687 --> 00:46:23,776
But now I'm the rightful king
by every law of Westeros.

668
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:26,617
And when I sit the Iron Throne,
you'll be my Hand.

669
00:46:33,638 --> 00:46:34,708
{\*I pray }I serve you well.

670
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,546
I expect you'll be the first
crabber's son to wear the badge.

671
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:48,035
You're the master of whisperers.
You're supposed to know everything.

672
00:46:48,285 --> 00:46:51,070
No man can be in all rooms
at all times.

673
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,975
I have many little birds
in the North, My Lord,

674
00:46:54,225 --> 00:46:58,565
but I haven't heard their songs
since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.

675
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:02,050
The Stark forces are distracted.
Now is the time to strike.

676
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:03,629
To strike?

677
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,761
My dear nephew, you do see these men
preparing the walls for siege?

678
00:47:08,011 --> 00:47:11,305
You do understand
Stannis Baratheon sails this way?

679
00:47:11,555 --> 00:47:13,664
If my Uncle Stannis
lands on the shores{\* of King's Landing},

680
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,291
- I'll ride out to greet him.
- A brave choice, Your Grace.

681
00:47:17,781 --> 00:47:20,421
I'm sure your men
will line up behind you.

682
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,687
They say Stannis never smiles.

683
00:47:23,976 --> 00:47:27,010
I'll give him a red smile
from ear to ear.

684
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,209
Imagine Stannis's terror.

685
00:47:36,218 --> 00:47:37,393
I am trying.

686
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:42,346
You're an intelligent man.
I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.

687
00:47:42,596 --> 00:47:46,321
Oh, no one disputes that, My Lord,
not even the multitudes who despise you.

688
00:47:46,571 --> 00:47:48,407
I wish we could converse
as two honest, intelligent men.

689
00:47:49,497 --> 00:47:50,951
I wish we could, too.

690
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:54,329
What do you want?

691
00:47:55,654 --> 00:47:56,677
Tell me.

692
00:47:57,858 --> 00:48:00,544
If we're going to play,
you'll have to start.

693
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:09,339
My brother was the youngest Kingsguard
in history.

694
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:13,602
My sister became Queen
at the age of 19.

695
00:48:15,749 --> 00:48:18,854
When I reached manhood, my father
put me in charge of all the drains

696
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:21,273
and cisterns in Casterly Rock.

697
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,423
A most highborn plumber.

698
00:48:23,673 --> 00:48:25,364
The water never flowed better.

699
00:48:25,614 --> 00:48:28,447
And all the shit
found its way to the sea.

700
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,094
I never expected
to have any real power.

701
00:48:31,613 --> 00:48:35,621
- So when my father named me {\*acting }Hand...
- You're {\*quite }good at being Hand, you know?

702
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,134
Jon Arryn and Ned Stark
were good men,

703
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:40,152
honorable men,

704
00:48:40,882 --> 00:48:43,628
but they disdained the game
and those who played.

705
00:48:43,878 --> 00:48:46,048
- You enjoy the game.
- I do.

706
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:48,626
Last thing I expected.

707
00:48:48,876 --> 00:48:51,782
- And you play it well.
- I'd like to keep playing it.

708
00:48:55,024 --> 00:48:57,858
If Stannis breaches the gates,
the game is over.

709
00:48:58,108 --> 00:49:02,237
They say he burns his enemies alive
to honor the Lord of Light.

710
00:49:02,996 --> 00:49:07,069
The Lord of Light wants {\*his }enemies burned,
the Drowned God wants them drowned.

711
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,363
Why are all the Gods
such vicious cunts?

712
00:49:10,649 --> 00:49:12,939
Where is the God of tits and wine?

713
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:17,913
In the Summer Isles, they worship
a fertility goddess with 16 teats.

714
00:49:18,606 --> 00:49:20,591
We should sail there immediately.

715
00:49:22,707 --> 00:49:24,545
This morning I heard a song

716
00:49:26,147 --> 00:49:28,382
all the way from Qarth
beyond the Red Waste.

717
00:49:29,689 --> 00:49:31,134
Daenerys Targaryen lives.

718
00:49:33,008 --> 00:49:35,995
A girl at the edge of the world
is the least of our problems.

719
00:49:36,245 --> 00:49:38,077
She has three dragons.

720
00:49:40,025 --> 00:49:44,397
But even if what they say is true,
it'll be years before they are {\*fully }grown.

721
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,986
And then there will be
nowhere to hide.

722
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,196
One game at a time, my friend.

723
00:50:01,877 --> 00:50:03,190
Careful, Khaleesi.

724
00:50:03,908 --> 00:50:07,750
Xaro owns this city and the warlocks
have 1,000 eyes watching for you.

725
00:50:09,781 --> 00:50:11,138
I found one...

726
00:50:12,087 --> 00:50:13,766
a ship with a good captain.

727
00:50:14,352 --> 00:50:16,388
- She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.
- Astapor?

728
00:50:17,659 --> 00:50:18,738
We cannot stay here.

729
00:50:18,988 --> 00:50:21,310
{\*They have my dragons. }A mother does not flee
without her children.

730
00:50:22,204 --> 00:50:24,062
They're not your children.

731
00:50:25,003 --> 00:50:29,151
{\*I know }They call you the Mother of Dragons,
{\*and I know you love them, }but you didn't grow them in your womb.

732
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:32,112
They didn't suckle at your breast.
They are dragons, Khaleesi.

733
00:50:32,659 --> 00:50:35,908
- And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.
- You should sail to Astapor.

734
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,804
I'm sure you'll be safe there.

735
00:50:40,676 --> 00:50:42,462
You know I would die for you.

736
00:50:43,873 --> 00:50:45,476
I will never abandon you.

737
00:50:46,338 --> 00:50:49,586
- I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.
- Then serve me.

738
00:50:50,564 --> 00:50:53,856
If my dragons are in the House
of the Undying, then take me there.

739
00:50:54,106 --> 00:50:56,637
That's what the warlock wants.
He told you so himself.

740
00:50:57,756 --> 00:51:00,428
If you enter that place,
you will never leave again.

741
00:51:00,678 --> 00:51:03,123
- His magic is strong.
- And what of my magic?

742
00:51:03,765 --> 00:51:07,397
You saw me step into the fire.{\* You watched the witch burn.}
What did the flames do to me?

743
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,950
Do you remember?

744
00:51:12,034 --> 00:51:14,798
Until my last breath I will remember.

745
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,576
After I have forgotten
my mother's face.

746
00:51:24,325 --> 00:51:25,776
They are my children.

747
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:30,440
And they are the only children
I will ever have.

748
00:51:37,015 --> 00:51:38,267
Take me to them.

749
00:51:50,981 --> 00:51:52,352
We should bury them.

750
00:51:53,436 --> 00:51:56,680
I'd leave 'em up a few more days.
Sends a message.

751
00:51:57,812 --> 00:52:00,075
If they haven't got the {\*damn }message{\* yet},
a few more days won't help.

752
00:52:01,272 --> 00:52:02,484
As you say.

753
00:52:02,734 --> 00:52:05,407
But it don't hurt
to let 'em rot a while longer.

754
00:52:06,744 --> 00:52:10,102
- What's this?
- Gold for the farmer.

755
00:52:10,352 --> 00:52:14,006
- For his trouble.
- His troubles are done.

756
00:52:15,449 --> 00:52:16,976
He's feeding the crops now.

757
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,302
His wife, too.

758
00:52:21,464 --> 00:52:24,090
You want to keep a man silent,
you silence him.

759
00:52:43,779 --> 00:52:46,987
Got as far as the farm
and then doubled back.

760
00:52:49,339 --> 00:52:52,118
Walked through the stream
to throw off the hounds.

761
00:52:54,483 --> 00:52:57,536
Hoped this would be the last place
they'd think to look.

762
00:53:00,046 --> 00:53:02,794
You're right so far.

763
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:08,285
Who was that out there
hung up the gates?

764
00:53:09,946 --> 00:53:12,022
Must have been the farmer's boys.

765
00:53:13,802 --> 00:53:15,710
He killed them and burned them

766
00:53:17,524 --> 00:53:19,829
and passed them off
as the little lords?

767
00:53:21,673 --> 00:53:23,062
They mustn't know.

768
00:53:24,817 --> 00:53:26,475
Bran would blame himself.

769
00:53:27,285 --> 00:53:28,919
They'll never hear it from me.

770
00:53:30,698 --> 00:53:32,821
The little lads have suffered enough.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
