Lovely boy.

10

What do you want?

11
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,819
A man has a thirst.

12
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,989
A man does not drink
for a day and a night.

13
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,090
A boy could
make a friend.

14
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,492
I have friends.

15
00:02:41,526 --> 00:02:43,728
Give us beer
before I skin you.

16
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,831
A man does not choose
his companions.

17
00:02:46,865 --> 00:02:48,766
These two, they have
no courtesy.

18
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,135
A man must ask
forgiveness.

19
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:56,006
You're called Arry?

20
00:02:58,143 --> 00:03:01,379
This man has the honor
to be Jaqen H'ghar,

21
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:02,914
once of the free city of--

22
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:04,583
Beer, you little shit.

23
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:07,152
Get us beer!

24
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,954
You should have
asked nicely.

25
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:10,122
Aah!

26
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,364
Come closer
and I'll shove that stick

27
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:20,067
up your bunghole
and fuck you bloody.

28
00:03:20,101 --> 00:03:22,636
A boy has more courage
than sense.

29
00:03:22,671 --> 00:03:24,238
Come here!

30
00:03:24,272 --> 00:03:25,973
Yoren said none of us
were to go near those three.

31
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:28,075
- Come here!
- They don't scare me.

32
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,177
Hmm?
Then you're stupid.

33
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:32,079
They scare me.

34
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,185
What are Gold Cloaks doing so
far from King's Landing?

35
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:46,858
- What are you doing?
- They're looking for me.

36
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,794
You in command here?

37
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,764
You're a long way
from home.

38
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,900
I asked you a question.

39
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,702
Aye, you did.

40
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,806
You asked
without manners

41
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,409
and I chose not to answer.

42
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:05,479
I have a royal warrant

43
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:09,150
for one of these gutter rats
you're transporting.

44
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:14,656
Well, the thing is...

45
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,958
These gutter rats belong
to the Night's Watch.

46
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:20,762
<i>Now, that puts them beyond the</i>
<i>reach of Kings and Queens.</i>

47
00:04:20,797 --> 00:04:22,631
Does it?

48
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:25,033
<i>It's a funny thing--</i>

49
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:27,202
people worry so much
about their throats

50
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:30,606
that they forget
about what's down low.

51
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,844
Now I sharpened this blade
before breakfast.

52
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:39,248
I could shave a spider's arse
if I wanted to

53
00:04:39,283 --> 00:04:43,253
or I could nick
this artery in your leg.

54
00:04:43,287 --> 00:04:45,856
And once it's nicked,
there's no one around here

55
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,959
who knows
how to unnick it.

56
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:51,795
We'll just keep that.

57
00:04:53,064 --> 00:04:56,834
Good steel is always
needed on the Wall.

58
00:04:56,868 --> 00:04:58,568
Seems you have
a choice--

59
00:04:58,603 --> 00:05:02,806
you can die here at this crossroads
a long way from home,

60
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,675
or you can go back to your city
and tell your Masters

61
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:08,711
you didn't find
what you were looking for.

62
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:16,553
We're looking
for a boy named Gendry.

63
00:05:16,588 --> 00:05:20,157
<i>He carries</i>
<i>a bull's head helmet.</i>

64
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:24,195
<i>Anyone turning him over</i>
<i>will earn the King's reward.</i>

65
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:27,198
We'll be back
with more men

66
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:30,067
and I'll be taking your head
home along with that bastard boy.

67
00:05:59,196 --> 00:06:01,697
- <i>( Distant seagulls</i>

68
00:06:05,702 --> 00:06:07,170
My Lord.

69
00:06:07,204 --> 00:06:09,171
You make me wait
a long time,

70
00:06:09,206 --> 00:06:11,441
but your friend
keeps me company.

71
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:14,544
We were just speaking
of your bravery

72
00:06:14,578 --> 00:06:17,981
in the victory against
the Stark auxiliary forces.

73
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:21,418
It was quite a battle.

74
00:06:21,452 --> 00:06:24,921
I heard you suffered
a terrible head wound.

75
00:06:24,956 --> 00:06:27,891
The northerners
are such fearsome warriors.

76
00:06:27,926 --> 00:06:30,528
And I tell him
the story of how we meet.

77
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,597
To find so lovely
a creature

78
00:06:33,632 --> 00:06:35,433
working in your
father's kitchens--

79
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:37,702
it almost beggars belief.

80
00:06:38,838 --> 00:06:40,773
Strange things do happen.

81
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:43,576
You should taste
her fish pie.

82
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,945
I don't think Lord Varys
likes fish pie.

83
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:48,948
- How can you tell?
- I can always tell.

84
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:51,184
<i>Men like Lord Varys</i>
<i>and I can't let</i>

85
00:06:51,218 --> 00:06:53,386
our disadvantages
get the best of us.

86
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,288
We'll make a fisherman
of him yet.

87
00:06:56,322 --> 00:06:58,189
I am glad
your new friend

88
00:06:58,224 --> 00:07:01,325
was able to accompany you
to the capital.

89
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,429
Friends are such
an important part of life.

90
00:07:05,463 --> 00:07:07,931
Unfortunate that your father
didn't want her to come.

91
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:10,500
<i>But rest easy, My Lord.</i>

92
00:07:10,535 --> 00:07:13,504
I am very good
at keeping secrets

93
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:15,739
for my good friends.

94
00:07:15,773 --> 00:07:18,242
Your discretion
is legendary...

95
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:19,676
where your friends
are concerned.

96
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:22,179
How unspeakable of me
to go on and on

97
00:07:22,213 --> 00:07:24,448
when all you want
to do is rest.

98
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:26,617
I will leave you.

99
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,787
Welcome to King's Landing,
my dear.

100
00:07:29,822 --> 00:07:33,258
This city is made brighter
by your presence.

101
00:07:33,292 --> 00:07:35,627
We have a council meeting,
My Lord.

102
00:07:39,198 --> 00:07:41,466
I don't like threats.

103
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:43,769
- Who threatened you?
- I'm not Ned Stark.

104
00:07:43,803 --> 00:07:45,937
I understand the way
this game is played.

105
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:47,572
Ned Stark
was a man of honor.

106
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:49,040
And I am not.

107
00:07:49,075 --> 00:07:52,577
Threaten me again and I'll have
you thrown into the sea.

108
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:58,016
You might be disappointed
in the results.

109
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,019
Storms come and go,

110
00:08:01,053 --> 00:08:03,221
the big fish eat
the little fish,

111
00:08:03,255 --> 00:08:06,290
and I keep on paddling.

112
00:08:07,326 --> 00:08:08,726
Come, My Lord.

113
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,128
We shouldn't keep
the queen waiting.

114
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:19,168
<i>"From this time</i>
<i>until the end of time,</i>

115
00:08:19,202 --> 00:08:21,036
<i>we are not part</i>
<i>of your realm,</i>

116
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:24,940
but a free and independent
kingdom of the North."

117
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,145
He has more spirit than
his father, I'll give him that.

118
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:34,482
You've perfected the art
of tearing up papers.

119
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:37,018
We can give him his father's bones
back at least

120
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:38,753
as a gesture
of good faith.

121
00:08:38,787 --> 00:08:40,822
You'll give the Starks
our reply, cousin?

122
00:08:41,757 --> 00:08:43,925
I will, Your Grace.

123
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,561
Did you see my brother

124
00:08:45,595 --> 00:08:46,996
when you were
the Starks' guest?

125
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,931
<i>I did.</i>

126
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:51,667
<i>They have not broken</i>
<i>his spirit, Your Grace.</i>

127
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:55,404
If you speak with him,

128
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:58,340
tell him he's not
been forgotten.

129
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,709
- I will, Your Grace.
- Safe travels, cousin.

130
00:09:05,048 --> 00:09:07,349
You have a deft hand
with diplomacy.

131
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:11,620
- If that's everything...
- A-- a raven flew in this morning

132
00:09:11,654 --> 00:09:14,523
from Castle Black.

133
00:09:14,557 --> 00:09:16,158
Trouble with
the wildlings.

134
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:18,660
That's why they're
called "wildlings."

135
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:21,329
Somewhat less wild
these days.

136
00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:23,165
Seems they've stopped
killing each other

137
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,302
and started following
this King-Beyond-the-Wall.

138
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:29,138
Another king?
How many is that now, five?

139
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:30,940
I've lost count.

140
00:09:30,974 --> 00:09:34,777
The Lord Commander asks that we
send more men to man the Wall.

141
00:09:34,812 --> 00:09:36,479
Perhaps he's forgotten
we're fighting a war.

142
00:09:36,513 --> 00:09:38,481
We have no men to spare.

143
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:40,217
"The cold winds
are rising

144
00:09:40,251 --> 00:09:42,820
and the dead rise
with them."

145
00:09:42,854 --> 00:09:46,457
The northerners are
a superstitious people.

146
00:09:46,491 --> 00:09:48,559
According to the Commander,
one of these dead men

147
00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:50,629
attacked him
in his chambers.

148
00:09:50,663 --> 00:09:52,664
Mormont doesn't lie.

149
00:09:52,698 --> 00:09:55,334
<i>How do you kill</i>
<i>a dead man?</i>

150
00:09:56,302 --> 00:09:58,303
Apparently you burn him.

151
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:01,273
One trip to the Wall
and you come back

152
00:10:01,307 --> 00:10:04,643
believing in grumpkins
and snarks.

153
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:08,213
I don't know
what I believe,

154
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:10,314
but here's
a fact for you--

155
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:11,949
<i>the Night's Watch</i>
<i>is the only thing</i>

156
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:14,651
that separates us from
what lies beyond the Wall.

157
00:10:14,686 --> 00:10:17,087
I have every confidence
that the brave men

158
00:10:17,122 --> 00:10:19,824
of the Night's Watch
will protect us all.

159
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:23,027
<i>And I said,</i>

160
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:24,728
"if the Gods wanted us
to have dignity,

161
00:10:24,763 --> 00:10:27,631
they wouldn't make us
fart when we died."

162
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,367
We fart when we die?

163
00:10:31,402 --> 00:10:33,336
My blessed mother--

164
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,438
I was holding her hand
when she left this world.

165
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:39,041
She farted so hard,
the whole bed shook.

166
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:52,153
Seems a bit greedy for one man
to have so many wives.

167
00:10:52,188 --> 00:10:54,656
Wouldn't two or three
be enough for him?

168
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:57,593
We were having
a serious discussion.

169
00:10:58,729 --> 00:11:00,830
Would you look at that?

170
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:05,069
Nothing like the sight
of a woman walking away.

171
00:11:05,103 --> 00:11:07,972
I prefer watching them
come towards me.

172
00:11:08,006 --> 00:11:09,607
I'm sure
that's nice, too.

173
00:11:09,641 --> 00:11:12,776
Yeah, well, there was
a milkmaid named Violet

174
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,379
on the next farm over
from where I grew up.

175
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:18,381
<i>We were wrestling together</i>
<i>from the time we were six years old.</i>

176
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:23,386
And then we got older
and the wrestling, uh...

177
00:11:24,388 --> 00:11:26,622
Changed.

178
00:11:26,656 --> 00:11:28,490
You were with her?

179
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:31,126
How many times?

180
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,662
Well, as many times
as I could.

181
00:11:36,866 --> 00:11:39,468
I wish I grew up
on a farm.

182
00:11:39,503 --> 00:11:40,837
We need more potatoes.

183
00:11:40,871 --> 00:11:43,239
Get another sack
from the sledge.

184
00:11:46,477 --> 00:11:48,745
Get the turnips, too.

185
00:12:00,157 --> 00:12:03,759
No. Ghost, no.

186
00:12:03,793 --> 00:12:06,228
<i>No!</i>

187
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:08,830
Ghost, away.
Shoo, shoo!

188
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:14,736
You all right?

189
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:17,573
- Did he frighten you?
- You-- you shouldn't touch me.

190
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:21,177
Oh. Oh, right.

191
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:22,846
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,649
I just wanted to make sure
you weren't hurt.

193
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:33,691
You're very brave.

194
00:12:44,035 --> 00:12:46,036
What are you doing?

195
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,870
This is Gilly.

196
00:12:47,905 --> 00:12:50,306
She's one of Craster's...
daughters.

197
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:52,189
Hello, Gilly.
What are you doing?

198
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:53,882
Sam said
you could help.

199
00:12:53,945 --> 00:12:55,551
I'm sorry, but Sam knows
we're not supposed--

200
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:56,776
She's pregnant.

201
00:13:03,822 --> 00:13:07,092
Have to take her
with us when we leave.

202
00:13:07,126 --> 00:13:08,927
What?

203
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:10,762
- What would that--
I know it sounds a bit mad.

204
00:13:10,797 --> 00:13:12,530
No, it doesn't sound a bit mad,
it's impossible.

205
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:14,899
- The Lord Commander ordered us to--
- We are sworn to protect.

206
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:17,501
- Sam, we can't take--
- please, ser, please.

207
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:19,436
I can still run
if I have to.

208
00:13:19,471 --> 00:13:21,872
- It's just not possible.
- I'm going to have a baby.

209
00:13:21,906 --> 00:13:24,474
If it's a boy...

210
00:13:24,508 --> 00:13:26,442
If it's a boy, what?

211
00:13:31,548 --> 00:13:33,816
You want us to risk
our lives for you

212
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,952
and you won't even
tell us why?

213
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:44,594
- Why'd you do that?
- Do what? Ask her a question?

214
00:13:44,628 --> 00:13:46,429
- You were cruel.
- Cruel?

215
00:13:46,464 --> 00:13:48,431
Sam, are you in such a hurry
to lose a hand?

216
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:50,800
- I didn't touch her.
- No, you just want to steal her.

217
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:52,569
What do you think
Craster cuts off for that?

218
00:13:52,603 --> 00:13:54,604
I can't steal her.

219
00:13:54,638 --> 00:13:56,906
She's a person,
not a goat.

220
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:05,282
We're heading deeper and deeper
into wildling territory.

221
00:14:05,316 --> 00:14:08,119
We can't take a girl with us.
Mormont wouldn't have it.

222
00:14:08,153 --> 00:14:11,055
And even if he would,
what would we do with her?

223
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:12,957
Who's going to
deliver a baby, you?

224
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,161
I could try.

225
00:14:16,196 --> 00:14:19,130
What?
I've read about it.

226
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:21,766
A bit.

227
00:14:23,202 --> 00:14:25,571
I'm sorry, Sam.

228
00:14:25,605 --> 00:14:27,506
We can't help her.

229
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:26,134
Khaleesi.

230
00:16:10,214 --> 00:16:13,116
- You don't need to see this.
- He is blood of my blood.

231
00:16:16,888 --> 00:16:19,890
- Who did this?
- Khal Pono, perhaps.

232
00:16:19,924 --> 00:16:22,259
<i>Khal Jhaqo.</i>

233
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:25,362
They don't like the idea of a woman
leading a Khalasar.

234
00:16:25,397 --> 00:16:28,631
They will like it far less
when I am done with them.

235
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:02,725
Is it as you remember,
My Lord?

236
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,960
It looks smaller.

237
00:18:04,994 --> 00:18:06,828
Everything looks bigger
when you're a child.

238
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:08,763
I remember
my father's cabin

239
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,598
felt like a palace
when I was little.

240
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:14,135
Now look at it.

241
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:16,437
They'll be waiting
for me on the docks.

242
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,239
Who will?

243
00:18:18,273 --> 00:18:20,107
<i>Anyone who matters.</i>

244
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,309
This is a big day for them.

245
00:18:22,344 --> 00:18:25,846
They haven't had much to get
excited about since I left.

246
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,948
It's a hard place,
the Iron Islands.

247
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:29,517
<i>Always has been.</i>

248
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:31,786
It's cold and it's wet.

249
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:33,555
Oh, I love
the cold and wet.

250
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:36,157
They say hard places
breed hard men.

251
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,395
And hard men
rule the world.

252
00:18:41,563 --> 00:18:44,899
Then you'll be king
before long.

253
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:50,705
Try smiling with
your lips closed.

254
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:52,873
Better.

255
00:18:55,277 --> 00:18:58,212
My father doesn't trust
you Iron islanders.

256
00:18:58,246 --> 00:19:00,214
I don't blame him.

257
00:19:00,248 --> 00:19:03,251
<i>He says that you're all</i>
<i>reavers and rapers</i>

258
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:05,119
and that no matter
how many women you have,

259
00:19:05,153 --> 00:19:07,154
you'll never be sat-- uh!

260
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:10,457
Quit talking about your father.

261
00:19:10,492 --> 00:19:13,294
But he's right
about us.

262
00:19:13,328 --> 00:19:17,030
Our wives from the Iron Islands,
they're for breeding.

263
00:19:17,065 --> 00:19:19,433
That's not enough for us.

264
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:21,935
That's why
we take salt wives--

265
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,537
the women we capture.

266
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:25,072
Capture me.

267
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:27,207
Take me with you
when you go ashore.

268
00:19:27,242 --> 00:19:31,379
- Make me your salt wife.
- Your place is on this ship.

269
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:33,547
Not after you leave.

270
00:19:33,582 --> 00:19:35,916
Father will punish me.

271
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:37,551
He'll call me a whore.

272
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,122
I haven't paid you.

273
00:19:53,036 --> 00:19:55,704
Oh, yeah.

274
00:20:04,915 --> 00:20:07,850
<i>- I paid good money...</i>

275
00:20:17,327 --> 00:20:19,695
I'm not going to stand for this.

276
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,430
I barely touched her.

277
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:23,666
Now, you charge twice as much
as every other brothel

278
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,567
and this is
what I get-- crying.

279
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:27,937
One moment, my friend.
A moment.

280
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,649
Please accept
my sincerest apologies.

281
00:20:39,683 --> 00:20:42,051
Aremca will take
good care of you.

282
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:16,586
- I'm sorry, My Lord.
- Shh, shh.

283
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:19,656
Did he hurt you?

284
00:21:20,992 --> 00:21:23,794
No, My Lord.

285
00:21:23,828 --> 00:21:26,597
It's Mhaegen.

286
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:28,999
Who?

287
00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:32,737
She works for you.

288
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:36,374
She's the one--
the Gold Cloaks,

289
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:38,709
- they killed her baby.
- Ah, yes.

290
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:41,412
That was...

291
00:21:41,446 --> 00:21:43,648
poorly handled.

292
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,319
Sometimes those
with the most power

293
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:50,055
have the least grace.

294
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:53,659
I can't stop
thinking about it.

295
00:21:53,693 --> 00:21:55,795
I can't sleep.

296
00:21:57,497 --> 00:22:00,299
That poor little baby.

297
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,135
You know, you remind me
of another girl,

298
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:05,204
a lovely thing
I once acquired

299
00:22:05,238 --> 00:22:08,240
from a Lysene
pleasure house--

300
00:22:08,275 --> 00:22:11,410
beautiful, like yourself,

301
00:22:11,444 --> 00:22:14,980
and intelligent,
like yourself.

302
00:22:15,015 --> 00:22:17,883
But she wasn't happy.

303
00:22:18,952 --> 00:22:22,288
She cried often.

304
00:22:22,322 --> 00:22:26,425
I asked her why,
but we didn't have

305
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,329
the kind of rapport
that you and I have.

306
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:35,268
Yes, it was quite sad.

307
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:40,274
Girls from the Lysene
pleasure houses are expensive,

308
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:42,443
extremely expensive.

309
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:46,114
And this one wasn't
making me any money.

310
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,887
I hate bad investments.

311
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:55,956
Really, I-- I do.

312
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,025
They haunt me.

313
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:05,132
I had no idea
how to make her happy,

314
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:08,234
no idea how
to mitigate my losses.

315
00:23:09,603 --> 00:23:11,871
A very wealthy patron,
he offered me

316
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:13,506
a tremendous
amount of money

317
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:18,511
to let him transform
this lovely, sad girl.

318
00:23:18,546 --> 00:23:22,315
To use her
in ways that...

319
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,085
Would never occur
to most men.

320
00:23:26,354 --> 00:23:29,489
And you know what
occurs to most men.

321
00:23:32,727 --> 00:23:37,564
I would not say he succeeded in
making her happy,

322
00:23:37,598 --> 00:23:42,202
but my losses were
definitely mitigated.

323
00:23:49,977 --> 00:23:52,145
Take tonight off
to mourn Mhaegen's child.

324
00:23:53,714 --> 00:23:55,615
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

325
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:58,418
And you'll be happy?

326
00:24:01,856 --> 00:24:03,924
That makes me happy.

327
00:24:15,736 --> 00:24:17,370
<i>More wine?</i>

328
00:24:18,706 --> 00:24:20,406
- Damn it, boy!
- Apologies, My Lord.

329
00:24:20,441 --> 00:24:24,477
Leave us, Podrick. I believe we
know how to pour our own wine.

330
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:27,047
That's your new squire?

331
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:29,115
I could've found you
a proper lad.

332
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,885
Myself, I prefer
the improper ones.

333
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,922
Mm, that's a good red.
Dornish?

334
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:36,423
You know your wines,
My Lord.

335
00:24:36,457 --> 00:24:37,958
That I do.

336
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:40,795
A fine dinner, My Lord.

337
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:42,764
Call me Tyrion, please.

338
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:44,633
I'm sure you're getting
used to fine dinners,

339
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:46,201
now that you're a lord.

340
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:48,103
Maybe I'll hire
this cook of yours.

341
00:24:48,138 --> 00:24:50,139
Wars have been
started for less.

342
00:24:52,175 --> 00:24:55,311
I heard there was some trouble in
Littlefinger's brothel the other night.

343
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:57,479
Mm, nasty business.

344
00:24:57,513 --> 00:24:59,481
- Had to be done.
- Yes, of course.

345
00:24:59,515 --> 00:25:01,749
The City Watch
must keep the peace,

346
00:25:01,783 --> 00:25:05,652
only I hadn't realized
peace depended on killing babies.

347
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:09,222
- Orders are orders.
- Quite right.

348
00:25:09,256 --> 00:25:11,324
Especially
the queen's orders.

349
00:25:11,358 --> 00:25:13,126
I never said they were
the queen's orders.

350
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,664
No, but who else would want to
murder King Robert's bastards?

351
00:25:17,698 --> 00:25:19,332
She's always been
a jealous woman.

352
00:25:19,366 --> 00:25:21,367
You know your sister
better than I do.

353
00:25:21,402 --> 00:25:23,436
You've heard the awful rumors
about my brother and sister?

354
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:25,105
I don't listen to filth.

355
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:28,408
That's good of you,
but you have heard them.

356
00:25:28,442 --> 00:25:31,344
I suppose people who do believe
that filth consider Robert's bastards

357
00:25:31,378 --> 00:25:34,046
to be better claimants to the throne
than Cersei's children.

358
00:25:34,081 --> 00:25:36,149
Joffrey is my king.
The rest doesn't interest me.

359
00:25:36,183 --> 00:25:38,351
I appreciate
your loyalty.

360
00:25:39,953 --> 00:25:43,955
Tell me, when your men
slaughtered Ned Stark's men

361
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:47,825
in the throne room,
did you give the order?

362
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,827
I did.

363
00:25:49,861 --> 00:25:51,562
And I would again.

364
00:25:51,596 --> 00:25:53,397
The man was a traitor.

365
00:25:53,432 --> 00:25:55,400
He tried to buy
my loyalty.

366
00:25:55,434 --> 00:25:57,602
The fool.

367
00:25:57,637 --> 00:25:59,771
He had no idea
you were already bought.

368
00:25:59,806 --> 00:26:02,007
Are you drunk?

369
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:04,210
I'll not have my honor
questioned by an Imp!

370
00:26:04,245 --> 00:26:08,348
I'm not questioning
Your Honor, Lord Janos.

371
00:26:08,382 --> 00:26:10,051
I'm denying its existence.

372
00:26:10,085 --> 00:26:13,187
If you think I'll stand here
and take this from you, dwarf--

373
00:26:13,254 --> 00:26:15,956
Dwarf? Mm, you should
have stopped at Imp.

374
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,659
And, yes, you will stand here
and take it from me,

375
00:26:18,694 --> 00:26:21,062
unless you'd like to take it
from my friend here.

376
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:24,098
I intend to serve
as Hand of the King

377
00:26:24,132 --> 00:26:25,799
until my father
returns from the war.

378
00:26:25,867 --> 00:26:27,934
And seeing as you betrayed
the last Hand of the King,

379
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:30,870
well, I just wouldn't
feel safe with you lurking about.

380
00:26:30,905 --> 00:26:32,405
What are you t--

381
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,208
my friends at court
will not allow this!

382
00:26:34,242 --> 00:26:36,343
- The queen herself has granted--
- The <i>queen regent.</i>

383
00:26:36,377 --> 00:26:39,246
And you're a fool to believe
she is your friend.

384
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:41,616
We shall hear what Joffrey
has to say about this.

385
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,719
No, we shan't.

386
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:53,562
There's a ship leaving
for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea tonight.

387
00:26:53,596 --> 00:26:57,231
From there I'm afraid it's rather
a long walk to Castle Black.

388
00:26:57,266 --> 00:26:59,401
<i>I hope you enjoy the Wall.</i>

389
00:26:59,435 --> 00:27:02,303
I found it
surprisingly beautiful...

390
00:27:02,338 --> 00:27:06,274
In a brutal, horribly
uncomfortable sort of way.

391
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:07,842
The lads will escort you.

392
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,744
The streets aren't safe
at night, My Lord.

393
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:12,147
These men are
under my command!

394
00:27:12,181 --> 00:27:14,349
I command you to arrest
this cutthroat.

395
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,218
His name is Bronn

396
00:27:16,252 --> 00:27:18,553
and he is the new
commander of the City Watch.

397
00:27:18,587 --> 00:27:20,221
Boys.

398
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,759
I have friends at court,

399
00:27:24,794 --> 00:27:27,329
powerful friends!

400
00:27:27,363 --> 00:27:29,931
The king himself
made me a lord!

401
00:27:34,871 --> 00:27:37,139
To the new Commander.

402
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:47,216
If I told you to murder
an infant girl, say,

403
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,486
still at her
mother's breast,

404
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:53,455
would you do it
without question?

405
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:57,493
Without question? No.

406
00:27:57,527 --> 00:27:59,828
I'd ask, "how much?"

407
00:28:17,148 --> 00:28:19,582
If they come back,
I say we yield.

408
00:28:19,617 --> 00:28:20,917
Gendry's the one
they want.

409
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:23,019
Don't want to get caught
in the middle of a battle.

410
00:28:23,053 --> 00:28:24,653
I ain't afraid
of no battles.

411
00:28:24,687 --> 00:28:27,322
If you got within a mile of a battle,
you'd fill your pants.

412
00:28:27,357 --> 00:28:28,857
I've seen
lots of battles.

413
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:30,558
- I saw--
- Liar.

414
00:28:30,593 --> 00:28:32,828
I saw a man
kill another man

415
00:28:32,862 --> 00:28:35,230
just outside a tavern
in Flea Bottom.

416
00:28:35,265 --> 00:28:37,666
Stabbed him
right in the neck.

417
00:28:37,701 --> 00:28:40,502
Two men fighting
isn't a battle.

418
00:28:40,537 --> 00:28:43,372
- They had armor on.
- So?

419
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:45,908
So, if they've got armor on,
it's a battle.

420
00:28:45,942 --> 00:28:47,710
No, it isn't.

421
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,346
What does a dyer's apprentice
know about battles anyway?

422
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,648
Gendry's an armorer's
apprentice.

423
00:28:52,682 --> 00:28:55,584
Hot pie, tell Gendry
what makes a fight into a battle.

424
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,922
It's, um, when
they've got armor on.

425
00:28:59,956 --> 00:29:02,758
<i>Who told you that?</i>

426
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:04,226
A knight.

427
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:06,896
How'd you know
he was a knight?

428
00:29:08,198 --> 00:29:11,567
Well, it was 'cause
he got armor on.

429
00:29:11,601 --> 00:29:13,635
You don't have to be a knight
to have armor.

430
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,337
Any idiot
can buy armor.

431
00:29:15,372 --> 00:29:17,106
<i>How do you know?</i>

432
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,241
'Cause I sold armor.

433
00:29:32,154 --> 00:29:33,621
What do the Gold Cloaks
want with you?

434
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:36,491
- No idea.
- <i>You're a liar.</i>

435
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,826
You know, you shouldn't insult
people that are bigger than you.

436
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:41,496
Then I wouldn't get
to insult anyone.

437
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,898
I don't care
what any of them want.

438
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:45,667
No good's ever come
of their questions.

439
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,902
No good's <i>ever</i> come?

440
00:29:47,937 --> 00:29:49,938
Who asked questions
before?

441
00:29:49,972 --> 00:29:53,274
How can someone so small be such
a huge pain in my ass?

442
00:29:53,308 --> 00:29:55,376
Who asked questions?

443
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:58,946
The Hand of the King.

444
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,182
Hands of the King.

445
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,385
Lord Arryn came first
a few weeks before he died,

446
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:08,956
and then Lord Stark came
a few weeks before he died.

447
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,925
Lord Stark?

448
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:15,229
See? Asking me
questions is bad luck.

449
00:30:16,264 --> 00:30:19,165
You'll probably
be dead soon.

450
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:22,468
- What did they ask about?
- My mom.

451
00:30:22,502 --> 00:30:25,171
- Who's your mom?
- Just my mom--

452
00:30:25,205 --> 00:30:27,240
worked in a tavern,
died when I was little.

453
00:30:27,274 --> 00:30:28,741
And who was your father?

454
00:30:28,776 --> 00:30:32,144
Could've been one of those
gold-hatted bastards, for all I know.

455
00:30:32,178 --> 00:30:34,279
What about you anyway?

456
00:30:34,313 --> 00:30:37,415
You thought
they were after you.

457
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,250
Why?

458
00:30:39,285 --> 00:30:41,819
Did you kill someone or is it
just because you're a girl?

459
00:30:42,988 --> 00:30:45,122
- I'm not a girl.
- Yes, you are.

460
00:30:45,157 --> 00:30:46,447
Do you think I'm as stupid
as the rest of them?

461
00:30:46,472 --> 00:30:47,672
Stupider.

462
00:30:47,993 --> 00:30:49,448
The Night's Watch doesn't take girls,
everyone knows that.

463
00:30:49,449 --> 00:30:50,986
Yeah, that's true,
but you're still a girl.

464
00:30:51,011 --> 00:30:52,211
I am not!

465
00:30:52,565 --> 00:30:54,766
Yeah? Well, pull your cock out
and take a piss, then.

466
00:30:56,269 --> 00:30:58,103
I don't need
to take a piss.

467
00:31:04,311 --> 00:31:06,379
Lommy and hot pie
can't know.

468
00:31:06,414 --> 00:31:07,847
No one can know.

469
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:11,785
Well, they won't,
not from me.

470
00:31:14,421 --> 00:31:16,956
My name's not Arry.

471
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,758
It's Arya...
of House Stark.

472
00:31:21,827 --> 00:31:25,029
Yoren is taking me home
to Winterfell.

473
00:31:25,063 --> 00:31:28,332
He was your father--
the Hand, the traitor.

474
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:30,400
He was never a traitor.

475
00:31:30,434 --> 00:31:32,468
Joffrey is a liar.

476
00:31:32,536 --> 00:31:34,837
So you're a highborn, then.
You're a lady.

477
00:31:34,872 --> 00:31:36,839
No. I mean, yes.

478
00:31:36,874 --> 00:31:38,308
My mother was a lady
and my sister--

479
00:31:38,342 --> 00:31:39,809
Yeah, but you were
a lord's daughter

480
00:31:39,843 --> 00:31:41,911
and you lived
in a castle and you--

481
00:31:41,946 --> 00:31:44,648
look, all that about cocks,
I should never have said--

482
00:31:44,682 --> 00:31:46,950
and I've been pissing
in front of you and everything.

483
00:31:46,984 --> 00:31:49,786
I-- I should be
calling you "My Lady."

484
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,789
- Do not call me "My Lady."
- As My Lady commands.

485
00:31:52,824 --> 00:31:54,758
Well, that was unladylike.

486
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:57,061
Oh!

487
00:32:24,022 --> 00:32:25,990
What's she carrying?

488
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,726
Myrish oranges,

489
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,796
wine from the Arbor...

490
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:35,266
And the heir to Pyke
and the Iron Islands.

491
00:32:37,702 --> 00:32:40,704
The only living son
of Balon Greyjoy.

492
00:32:43,775 --> 00:32:45,942
Me.

493
00:32:47,111 --> 00:32:49,545
I don't like wine.

494
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,681
Woman's drink.

495
00:32:54,251 --> 00:32:56,053
I need to get to Pyke.

496
00:33:05,998 --> 00:33:07,965
I'll find you a horse.

497
00:33:18,478 --> 00:33:21,847
I'm heading that way.
I can take you there.

498
00:33:21,882 --> 00:33:24,550
I bet you can.

499
00:33:24,584 --> 00:33:26,418
Have you been
at sea long?

500
00:33:26,453 --> 00:33:28,988
Or were there just no women
where you came from?

501
00:33:29,022 --> 00:33:31,424
- None like you.
- You don't know what I'm like.

502
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:34,126
Maybe you don't know
what you're like.

503
00:33:34,161 --> 00:33:37,196
Maybe you need
someone to teach you.

504
00:33:37,231 --> 00:33:39,365
Do you know who I am?

505
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,636
You think I offer free rides
to every man in jewelry,

506
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,939
Lord Greyjoy?

507
00:33:47,976 --> 00:33:50,377
Have my things sent up
to the castle.

508
00:34:07,362 --> 00:34:09,263
You should give me
the reins.

509
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,165
I'm a better rider
than you.

510
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,300
I've been on horseback
for the past nine years.

511
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:14,802
Nine years?

512
00:34:14,836 --> 00:34:17,304
Do you still know
your way around a ship?

513
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:19,373
Have these hands
ever touched a rope?

514
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:21,875
Don't you worry
about my hands.

515
00:34:23,711 --> 00:34:25,812
The sea is in my blood.

516
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:29,149
Your blood will be in the sea
if I don't watch where I'm going.

517
00:34:29,183 --> 00:34:32,352
I have a proposal
for my father,

518
00:34:32,387 --> 00:34:35,056
one that will
make him king again,

519
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,158
and me after him.

520
00:34:38,927 --> 00:34:41,863
You may get to stay
in a castle tonight if you're lucky.

521
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:44,032
Is that an offer
from my future king?

522
00:34:44,067 --> 00:34:46,635
An order from
your future king.

523
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:51,540
You can tell your grandchildren
about this night.

524
00:34:51,574 --> 00:34:54,709
I don't imagine it will be
a story fit for children.

525
00:35:07,922 --> 00:35:10,056
Father.

526
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:13,259
Nine years, is it?

527
00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:15,295
They took
a frightened boy.

528
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:18,165
<i>What have</i>
<i>they given back?</i>

529
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:21,602
A man.

530
00:35:21,637 --> 00:35:25,040
- Your blood and your heir.
- <i>We shall see.</i>

531
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:29,112
Stark had you
longer than I did.

532
00:35:29,146 --> 00:35:31,314
<i>Lord Stark is gone.</i>

533
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:36,119
And how do you feel
about that?

534
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,458
What's done is done.

535
00:35:41,492 --> 00:35:43,527
I've brought you
a proposal from Robb Stark.

536
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:46,696
Who gave you
those clothes?

537
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:50,200
Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
to make you his daughter?

538
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:53,169
If my clothes offend you,
I will change them.

539
00:35:53,204 --> 00:35:54,871
You will.

540
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,442
That bauble
'round your neck--

541
00:35:58,476 --> 00:36:01,612
did you pay the iron price
for it or the gold?

542
00:36:02,814 --> 00:36:04,415
<i>I asked a question.</i>

543
00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:07,085
<i>Did you pull it from the neck</i>
<i>of a corpse you made</i>

544
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,723
or did you buy it
to match your fine clothes?

545
00:36:13,526 --> 00:36:16,827
Iron or gold?

546
00:36:19,064 --> 00:36:21,198
Gold.

547
00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:27,872
I'll not have my son
dressed as a whore.

548
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:33,343
My fears have come true--

549
00:36:33,378 --> 00:36:35,612
the Starks
have made you theirs.

550
00:36:35,647 --> 00:36:38,917
- My blood is salt and iron.
- Yet the Stark boy sends you to me

551
00:36:38,951 --> 00:36:42,220
like a trained raven
clutching his message.

552
00:36:42,288 --> 00:36:44,222
The offer he makes
is one I proposed.

553
00:36:44,257 --> 00:36:46,825
- He heeds your counsel?
- I've lived with him,

554
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,427
hunted with him,
fought at his side.

555
00:36:48,495 --> 00:36:50,096
He thinks of me
as a brother.

556
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,766
No, not here,
not in my hearing.

557
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,301
You will not
name him brother,

558
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:59,272
this son of the man who put
your true brothers to the sword.

559
00:36:59,307 --> 00:37:02,142
Or have you forgotten
your own blood?

560
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:04,144
I forget nothing.

561
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:07,047
I remember my brothers.

562
00:37:07,082 --> 00:37:10,017
And I remember
when my father was a king.

563
00:37:26,102 --> 00:37:28,103
I see.

564
00:37:28,138 --> 00:37:30,739
I destroy Robb Stark's
enemies for him

565
00:37:30,773 --> 00:37:34,176
and he will make me
king of the Iron Islands once again.

566
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:38,012
- I will lead the attack myself.
- Oh, you will?

567
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,648
I'm your son,
your only living heir.

568
00:37:40,682 --> 00:37:43,117
Who else?

569
00:37:45,153 --> 00:37:47,254
I told you to wait outside.

570
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,691
How did you get
past the guards?

571
00:37:50,725 --> 00:37:53,126
Anything with a cock
is easy to fool.

572
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:55,930
My dear.

573
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:00,701
Yara?

574
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:03,604
So good to see you,
brother.

575
00:38:03,638 --> 00:38:07,274
This is a homecoming I'll tell
my grandchildren about.

576
00:38:09,778 --> 00:38:11,212
She can't lead an attack!

577
00:38:11,246 --> 00:38:14,482
- And why not?
- You're a woman!

578
00:38:14,516 --> 00:38:17,952
- You're the one in skirts.
- This isn't Winterfell, boy.

579
00:38:17,987 --> 00:38:20,488
Your sister took over command
of your eldest brother's ship

580
00:38:20,523 --> 00:38:23,391
after your new father
killed him.

581
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:27,128
What's dead may never die.

582
00:38:27,163 --> 00:38:29,164
The only nights she's spent
off these islands

583
00:38:29,198 --> 00:38:31,199
have been spent
on the sea.

584
00:38:32,234 --> 00:38:34,235
<i>She's commanded men.</i>

585
00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:36,304
<i>She's killed men.</i>

586
00:38:36,338 --> 00:38:38,473
She knows who she is.

587
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,578
No man gives me
a crown.

588
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,815
I pay the iron price.

589
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:48,783
I will take my crown,

590
00:38:48,818 --> 00:38:52,087
for that is who I am.

591
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,556
That is who
we have always been.

592
00:38:59,196 --> 00:39:01,264
You won't stand a chance against
the Lannisters on your own.

593
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:04,167
Who said anything
about the Lannisters?

594
00:39:11,777 --> 00:39:13,245
<i>You'll have your gold</i>

595
00:39:13,279 --> 00:39:14,913
<i>when we take the treasury</i>
<i>at King's Landing.</i>

596
00:39:14,947 --> 00:39:16,715
All these kings
fighting for the throne,

597
00:39:16,749 --> 00:39:19,685
and this Stannis
has the smallest army.

598
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:21,686
Why would I bet on the man
with the worst chance?

599
00:39:21,721 --> 00:39:25,023
Because you're
a smart gambler.

600
00:39:25,058 --> 00:39:28,026
Stannis has proved
himself in war twice.

601
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,329
His baby brother has never set foot
on a battlefield.

602
00:39:31,364 --> 00:39:33,131
Neither has
the false King Joffrey.

603
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:35,133
And yet they both
have larger armies.

604
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,135
Stannis has just
begun the fight.

605
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:40,771
His Bannermen
will rally to his cause.

606
00:39:40,806 --> 00:39:43,507
There's no man
in the Seven Kingdoms

607
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:45,109
more honorable
than Stannis Baratheon

608
00:39:45,143 --> 00:39:46,543
or more worthy
of loyalty.

609
00:39:46,578 --> 00:39:48,144
What is the world
coming to

610
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:50,780
when smugglers must vouch
for the honor of kings?

611
00:39:50,814 --> 00:39:53,216
- Mind your words, pirate.
- Matthos.

612
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,784
You think I'm insulted?

613
00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:57,820
I <i>am</i> a pirate.
I'm an excellent pirate.

614
00:39:57,855 --> 00:40:00,490
<i>I don't sail</i>
<i>for promises.</i>

615
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:01,924
Of course you do.

616
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:04,627
Every time you leave harbor,
you're leaving on a promise--

617
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:06,128
a promise that
somewhere on the sea,

618
00:40:06,163 --> 00:40:08,564
somebody's got some gold
and you can take it from him.

619
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:11,367
- That's a promise that always comes true.
- As is mine.

620
00:40:11,402 --> 00:40:13,637
You're not a young man,
Salladhor.

621
00:40:13,671 --> 00:40:15,472
And correct me
if I'm wrong--

622
00:40:15,506 --> 00:40:17,207
most pirates
don't grow old.

623
00:40:17,242 --> 00:40:19,343
Only the clever ones.

624
00:40:19,377 --> 00:40:22,279
You want to spend
your last few years on the sea

625
00:40:22,313 --> 00:40:24,414
stealing from
Pentoshi cheesemongers

626
00:40:24,449 --> 00:40:25,783
and Meereenese
silk merchants?

627
00:40:25,817 --> 00:40:27,884
Then go.
They're out there waiting for you.

628
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:29,620
That's easy.

629
00:40:29,654 --> 00:40:32,189
What I'm offering you
is hard.

630
00:40:33,925 --> 00:40:37,761
Come with me and plunder
the greatest city in Westeros.

631
00:40:37,795 --> 00:40:40,497
You'll be the richest man
in Lys and the most famous.

632
00:40:40,531 --> 00:40:44,401
They'll be singing songs about you
as long as men have voices to sing.

633
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:48,338
"Salladhor Saan"
is a good name for songs.

634
00:40:48,373 --> 00:40:51,941
- It is.
- <i>One thing-- I want the queen.</i>

635
00:40:51,976 --> 00:40:54,777
- The queen?
- Cersei-- I want her.

636
00:40:54,812 --> 00:40:57,279
I'll sail with your fleet,
all 30 of my ships.

637
00:40:57,314 --> 00:40:59,615
And if we don't drown at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay,

638
00:40:59,649 --> 00:41:02,918
I will fuck this blonde queen
and I'll fuck her well.

639
00:41:02,953 --> 00:41:04,787
This war
isn't about you.

640
00:41:04,821 --> 00:41:08,123
We're not attacking King's Landing
so that you can rape the queen.

641
00:41:08,158 --> 00:41:10,959
I'm not going to rape her.
I'm going to fuck her.

642
00:41:10,994 --> 00:41:13,128
As if she would
just let you.

643
00:41:13,162 --> 00:41:14,829
You don't know
how persuasive I am.

644
00:41:14,864 --> 00:41:17,131
I've never tried
to fuck you.

645
00:41:18,834 --> 00:41:22,470
Stannis is the rightful king
and the Lord of Light,

646
00:41:22,504 --> 00:41:23,871
the one true God--

647
00:41:23,905 --> 00:41:25,472
I've been all over
the world, my boy,

648
00:41:25,507 --> 00:41:28,175
and everywhere I go,
people tell me about the true Gods.

649
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:30,377
They all think
they found the right one.

650
00:41:30,411 --> 00:41:33,714
The one true God
is what's between a woman's legs,

651
00:41:33,748 --> 00:41:36,317
and better yet,
a queen's legs.

652
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,921
I never thought you'd have
a true believer for a son.

653
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,656
Eh, he's young yet.

654
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,694
I promise you the gold.
I promise you the glory.

655
00:41:45,729 --> 00:41:47,463
I cannot promise you
the queen.

656
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:52,668
You believe
your king can win?

657
00:41:52,702 --> 00:41:54,903
He is the one true king.

658
00:41:54,937 --> 00:41:56,738
You Westerosi
are funny people.

659
00:41:56,772 --> 00:41:59,140
A man chops off your fingers
and you fall in love with him.

660
00:42:01,944 --> 00:42:04,512
I'll sail with you,
Davos Seaworth.

661
00:42:04,546 --> 00:42:08,149
You're the most honest
smuggler I ever met.

662
00:42:08,183 --> 00:42:10,384
Make me rich.

663
00:42:10,418 --> 00:42:13,821
Get me to the gates
of King's Landing and I will.

664
00:42:25,635 --> 00:42:27,269
<i>When will the king</i>
<i>have us sail?</i>

665
00:42:27,303 --> 00:42:29,638
As soon as his God
wills it.

666
00:42:29,706 --> 00:42:32,308
He's my God, too,
and yours,

667
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:35,011
but you are
too blind to see.

668
00:42:37,114 --> 00:42:39,148
- Let me teach you how to read.
- Oh, you and your mother.

669
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,849
It won't take long.
You already know the letters.

670
00:42:40,884 --> 00:42:43,084
The holy books are much more
persuasive than I can be.

671
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,886
I wish I had
a God, truly.

672
00:42:44,921 --> 00:42:47,589
I'm not mocking you, but I've seen
men pray to every God there is--

673
00:42:47,623 --> 00:42:50,024
pray for wind, pray for rain,
pray for home.

674
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:52,827
- None of it works.
- But you always came home.

675
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:56,798
- I wasn't praying.
- No, but I was.

676
00:42:58,267 --> 00:42:59,934
Every night
that you were at sea,

677
00:42:59,968 --> 00:43:03,071
I lit a candle
and I prayed for you.

678
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,806
You want me
to have a God?

679
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,976
Fine. King Stannis
is my God.

680
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:11,478
He raised me up
and blessed me with his trust.

681
00:43:11,513 --> 00:43:14,081
He gave you a future
I could never have imagined.

682
00:43:14,116 --> 00:43:16,117
You know how to read.
You'll be a knight someday.

683
00:43:16,151 --> 00:43:19,420
You think a fire God
commanded all that?

684
00:43:19,454 --> 00:43:22,856
It was Stannis,
only Stannis.

685
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:25,759
Stannis is my king,
but he's only a man.

686
00:43:25,793 --> 00:43:28,761
Don't tell him that.

687
00:43:30,598 --> 00:43:32,732
Lord Janos Slynt was
commander of the City Watch.

688
00:43:32,766 --> 00:43:34,167
You had no right
to exile him.

689
00:43:34,201 --> 00:43:35,902
I have every right.
I am the King's Hand.

690
00:43:35,936 --> 00:43:38,471
You're serving as the King's Hand
till father gets here.

691
00:43:38,506 --> 00:43:40,073
I am Queen Regent.

692
00:43:40,108 --> 00:43:41,775
Listen to me,
Queen Regent.

693
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:44,211
You're losing the people.

694
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,348
- Do you hear me?
-  The people.

695
00:43:46,382 --> 00:43:48,150
You think I care?

696
00:43:48,184 --> 00:43:49,852
You might
find it difficult

697
00:43:49,886 --> 00:43:52,755
to rule over millions
who want you dead.

698
00:43:52,789 --> 00:43:54,656
Half the city will starve
when winter comes.

699
00:43:54,691 --> 00:43:56,225
The other half will plot
to overthrow you.

700
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:59,261
<i>And your gold-plated thugs</i>
<i>just gave them</i>

701
00:43:59,296 --> 00:44:01,097
their rallying cry--

702
00:44:01,131 --> 00:44:03,733
"The Queen
slaughters babies."

703
00:44:05,669 --> 00:44:09,305
You don't even have
the decency to deny it.

704
00:44:18,882 --> 00:44:22,385
It wasn't you who gave
the order, was it?

705
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,287
<i>Joffrey didn't</i>
<i>even tell you.</i>

706
00:44:27,025 --> 00:44:28,659
Did he tell you?

707
00:44:28,694 --> 00:44:30,028
I imagine that
would be even worse.

708
00:44:30,062 --> 00:44:32,998
He did what needed
to be done.

709
00:44:33,032 --> 00:44:36,068
You want to be Hand of the King?
You want to rule?

710
00:44:36,102 --> 00:44:38,970
This is what ruling is--
lying on a bed of weeds,

711
00:44:39,005 --> 00:44:41,439
ripping them out
by the root, one by one,

712
00:44:41,473 --> 00:44:43,040
before they strangle you
in your sleep.

713
00:44:43,075 --> 00:44:45,609
I'm no king, but I think there's more
to ruling than that.

714
00:44:45,643 --> 00:44:47,644
I don't care
what you think!

715
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:49,246
You've never
taken it seriously.

716
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,614
You haven't,
Jaime hasn't.

717
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,153
It's all fallen on me.

718
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:04,995
As has Jaime repeatedly,
according to Stannis Baratheon.

719
00:45:09,901 --> 00:45:12,336
You're funny.

720
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:18,209
You've always
been funny...

721
00:45:18,243 --> 00:45:20,178
<i>But none of your jokes</i>
<i>will ever match</i>

722
00:45:20,212 --> 00:45:22,413
the first one, will they?

723
00:45:23,616 --> 00:45:26,317
You remember?

724
00:45:26,352 --> 00:45:28,053
Back when you ripped
my mother open

725
00:45:28,087 --> 00:45:30,788
on your way out of her
and she bled to death?

726
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:34,959
She was my mother, too.

727
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:37,061
Mother gone...

728
00:45:38,664 --> 00:45:40,965
For the sake of you.

729
00:45:43,468 --> 00:45:46,971
<i>There's no bigger joke</i>
<i>in the world than that.</i>

730
00:46:08,294 --> 00:46:11,330
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

731
00:46:11,364 --> 00:46:13,498
How did you fare
with your pirate?

732
00:46:13,533 --> 00:46:16,969
Salladhor Saan will join
our fleet-- 30 ships.

733
00:46:17,003 --> 00:46:19,004
His men know
how to fight.

734
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:22,441
In my experience, pirates
prefer fighting unarmed men.

735
00:46:22,476 --> 00:46:24,110
It does seem
the wiser choice.

736
00:46:24,144 --> 00:46:26,579
There won't be
a choice this time.

737
00:46:27,781 --> 00:46:29,516
Do you trust him?

738
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,251
Salladhor Saan
is an old friend.

739
00:46:31,285 --> 00:46:33,253
I've known him 30 years.

740
00:46:33,287 --> 00:46:35,555
I've never trusted him,

741
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:39,693
but once he gets the smell of gold,
he never stops.

742
00:46:39,727 --> 00:46:42,963
Well, if he does his job,
he'll have his share.

743
00:46:46,134 --> 00:46:47,735
Leave us.

744
00:46:53,876 --> 00:46:55,477
At once, Your Grace.

745
00:47:02,385 --> 00:47:05,687
The Lord of Light shines
through you, young warrior.

746
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,994
Come.

747
00:47:19,834 --> 00:47:21,335
What did you say to him?

748
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:24,805
I told him death by fire
is the purest death.

749
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:28,042
- Why?
- <i>Because it is true.</i>

750
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:30,844
You're troubled, my king.

751
00:47:30,879 --> 00:47:33,046
Yeah.

752
00:47:33,081 --> 00:47:35,716
These armies are toys
for the Lord of Light.

753
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:38,719
Tell your lord
to burn them, then.

754
00:47:38,753 --> 00:47:40,187
I tell him nothing.

755
00:47:40,221 --> 00:47:43,424
I pray for his commands
and I obey.

756
00:47:45,193 --> 00:47:49,096
My little brother has 100,000
men according to the scouts,

757
00:47:49,131 --> 00:47:52,333
men whose allegiance
rightly belongs to me.

758
00:47:52,367 --> 00:47:54,268
<i>You must have faith.</i>

759
00:47:54,303 --> 00:47:56,337
Faith?

760
00:47:56,372 --> 00:47:59,907
<i>In a real war, the side</i>
<i>with the greater number wins</i>

761
00:47:59,942 --> 00:48:01,876
nine times out of 10.

762
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:03,544
Then we must be
the 10th.

763
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:07,916
I cannot defeat
my brother in the field.

764
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:11,420
And I can't take King's Landing
without the men he's stolen.

765
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:16,592
I have seen the path
to victory in the flames.

766
00:48:18,094 --> 00:48:21,463
But first, you must give yourself
to the Lord of Light.

767
00:48:21,497 --> 00:48:24,833
I've said the words,
damn you.

768
00:48:27,937 --> 00:48:30,205
I burnt the idols.

769
00:48:33,509 --> 00:48:37,479
You must give
all of yourself.

770
00:48:41,984 --> 00:48:43,985
I have a wife.

771
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:47,189
I took a vow.

772
00:48:48,357 --> 00:48:52,727
She's sickly, weak...

773
00:48:54,263 --> 00:48:57,365
Shut away in a tower.

774
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,501
She disgusts you.

775
00:49:02,505 --> 00:49:05,540
And she's given
you nothing--

776
00:49:05,608 --> 00:49:10,312
no sons,
only stillborns,

777
00:49:10,346 --> 00:49:12,514
only death.

778
00:49:18,487 --> 00:49:22,957
I will give you
a son, my king.

779
00:49:25,294 --> 00:49:27,395
A son?
