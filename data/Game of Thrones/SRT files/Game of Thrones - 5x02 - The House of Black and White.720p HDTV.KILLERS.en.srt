In the old times,
whenever braavos
stood in danger,

4
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:09,201
The titan would step
with fire in his eyes.

5
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:12,955
He'd wade into the sea
and smash the enemies.

6
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:15,541
He's just a statue.

7
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:22,431
Don't be afraid.

8
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:24,633
He's announcing
our arrival.

You are becoming
an observant young lady.

52
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:32,775
My mother used to say,
"dark wings, dark words."

53
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,445
An old saying.
Inaccurate in this case.

Excuse me.

64
00:08:01,672 --> 00:08:02,938
She's dyed her hair,
but it's her.

She's sitting

Too many.

He said, "your loyalty
came free of charge."

Someone appears
to have paid quite
a bit for it since then.

Lady sansa,

87
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:18,847
Before your mother's death,

88
00:09:18,883 --> 00:09:21,216
I was her sworn sword.

89
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:24,419
I gave my word i would
find you and protect you.

90
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,756
I will shield your back
and keep your counsel

91
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:30,259
And give my life
for yours if need be.

92
00:09:30,294 --> 00:09:33,896
I swear it
by the old gods
and the new.

93
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:36,865
Please, lady brienne,

94
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:38,901
No need
for such formality.

95
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:41,286
You were catelyn stark's
sworn sword?

96
00:09:41,322 --> 00:09:43,438
I was.
Strange.

97
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,073
<i>I knew cat from the time</i>
<i>we were children.</i>

98
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:46,825
She never mentioned you.

99
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,744
It was after
renly's murder.

100
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:49,962
Ah, yes.

101
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:51,914
You were accused
of killing him.

102
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,716
I tried to save him.
But you were accused.

103
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:56,668
By men who didn't see
what happened.

104
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,420
And what did happen?

105
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:05,093
He was murdered
by a shadow.

106
00:10:05,128 --> 00:10:07,846
A shadow with the face
of stannis baratheon.

107
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:11,233
A shadow?

108
00:10:11,268 --> 00:10:14,770
With the face--

109
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:17,856
<i>This woman swore</i>
<i>to protect renly.</i>

110
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,157
<i>She failed.</i>

111
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:22,661
She swore
to protect your mother.
She failed.

112
00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:26,999
Why would i want somebody
with your history of failure
guarding lady sansa?

113
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:29,084
Why should you have
any say in her affairs?

114
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:30,652
Because i am her uncle.

115
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:34,122
I married her aunt lysa
shortly before my beloved's
untimely death.

116
00:10:34,174 --> 00:10:37,042
We're family now
and you are an outsider.

117
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:40,963
Forgive me, lady brienne,
but experience has made me
wary of outsiders.

118
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:44,049
Lady sansa, if we can
have a word alone--

119
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,601
No.

120
00:10:45,636 --> 00:10:47,002

If i could explain--

121
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,721
I saw you at joffrey's
wedding bowing to the king.

122
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:53,358
Neither of us
wanted to be there.

123
00:10:53,394 --> 00:10:55,193
Sometimes we don't
have a choice.

124
00:10:55,229 --> 00:10:57,396
And sometimes we do.

00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:01,650

We don't want
our new friend wandering

We'll follow them.

My lady,
if both stark girls
refused your service,

Maybe you're released
from your vow.

158
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,342
I swore to their mother
i would protect those girls.

159
00:14:14,377 --> 00:14:15,877
But if they don't want
your protection--

160

It's a threat.
Of course it's a threat.

Our daughter's

No note?

And every other tragedy

cursed country.

Then don't call her
your daughter.

You've never been
a father to her.

181

of my children, they'd be
stoned in the street.

182
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:39,928
And what has
your caution brought?

183
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,349
Our eldest child murdered
at his own wedding.

184
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,935
Our only daughter
shipped off to dorne.

185
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:49,771
Our baby boy set to marry

186
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:52,440
That smirking whore
from highgarden.

187
00:16:01,118 --> 00:16:02,584
I'm going to make
things better.

188
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:04,286
You've never made
anything better.

189
00:16:04,321 --> 00:16:05,837
I'm going to dorne

190
00:16:05,873 --> 00:16:07,706
And i'm bringing
our daughter home.

191
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,625
you can't just
ask prince doran

192
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,794
To give her back.

193
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:14,095
She's promised to his son.

194
00:16:14,131 --> 00:16:16,998
I'm not going
to ask him anything.

195
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,267
You go down
there with an army,
it's an act of war.

196
00:16:19,303 --> 00:16:20,835
No army.

197
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,888
Do you know where
they're keeping her?

198
00:16:26,143 --> 00:16:28,393
Oberyn mentioned
the water gardens.

199
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,312
I'll find her.

200
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,900
Is there anything else,
your grace?

201
00:16:36,486 --> 00:16:39,704
you're going to dorne?

202
00:16:40,741 --> 00:16:44,209
A one-handed man alone?

203
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:47,295
I never said
i was going alone.

204
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:57,889
No sunflowers.
I don't like yellow.

205
00:16:57,925 --> 00:17:00,392
Roses are very nice.
Definitely roses.

206
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:02,060
And music.
I adore music.

207
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:04,229
But no flutes.
I hate flutes.

208
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:06,231
We can have
a harp if you like,
but no flutes.

209
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:08,600
Then there's the food.
Food is the most
important thing.

210
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,102
Don't you agree?
We're going to need
pigeon pies.

211
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:14,522
That's what they eat
in the capital,
don't they?

212
00:17:14,557 --> 00:17:16,274
Don't they?

213
00:17:17,611 --> 00:17:19,160
Don't who?

214
00:17:19,196 --> 00:17:22,197
People eat
pigeon pie
in the capital.

215
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:24,916
They certainly do,
my dear.

216
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:27,285
They certainly do.

217
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,704
It's a fine place,
isn't it?

218
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:31,423
A fine place.

219
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,408
I never thought
i'd end up

220
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,378
Settling down
in a place like this.

221
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:39,631
You won't.
Pardon?

222
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,599
We won't get to live
at stokeworth.

223
00:17:41,635 --> 00:17:44,636
When mother dies,
my sister gets the castle
because she's older.

224
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,587
Oh.
She hates me.

225
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:49,224
She calls me mean names
and sometimes even still

226
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:52,227
She pulls my hair
when mother's not looking.

227
00:17:53,613 --> 00:17:55,313
You know what i think?

228
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,532
I think you're
a good person.

229
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:59,901
And your sister
is a mean person.

230
00:17:59,936 --> 00:18:01,569
She is.

231
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,273
I've been all over
the world,

232
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,325
And if there's one thing
i've learned,

233
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:10,412
It's that meanness
comes around.

234
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,297
People like your sister,

235
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:15,800
They always get what's coming
to them eventually.

236
00:18:15,836 --> 00:18:17,919
One way or another.

237
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,091
Who's that?

238
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,512
Jaime fucking lannister.

239
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:32,317
Ser jaime.
Ser bronn of the blackwater.

240
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,987
I was very sorry
to hear about your father.

241
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:37,856
Thank you.

242
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,692
This is
my betrothed lollys.

243
00:18:42,362 --> 00:18:44,112
A pleasure.

244
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:48,199
Run along, love.

245
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,541
Beautiful young bride
you've chosen.

246
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,626
When were you planning
on getting married?

247
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:01,012
Just get on with it.
On with what?

248
00:19:01,048 --> 00:19:02,797
What you're here for.

249
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:05,666
There's no way this little
visit could possibly mean
anything good for me.

250
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:08,019
It's very good for you.

251
00:19:19,566 --> 00:19:22,567
Lollys will be marrying
ser willis bracken.

252
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,952
Mmm.

253
00:19:23,987 --> 00:19:26,704
We made a deal,
your sister and i.

254
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,374
I would have
advised against that.
How is this good for me?

255
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:32,410
'cause you're going to come
with me and help me with
something important.

256
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:36,030
And when we return,
i'm going to give you
a much better girl

257
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,999
And a much better castle.

258
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,004
Return from where?

259
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,507
As far south
as south goes.

260
00:19:58,738 --> 00:20:02,357
<i>My future queen.</i>

261
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,460
The prince does not wish
to be disturbed.

262
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,546
Remove yourself
from my path

263
00:20:24,581 --> 00:20:26,464
Or i'll take that longaxe
and i'll shove it--

264
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,266
<i>Captain.</i>

265
00:20:29,553 --> 00:20:31,386
<i>Let her pass.</i>

266
00:20:35,091 --> 00:20:37,442
Your brother was murdered

267
00:20:37,477 --> 00:20:39,561
And you sit here
in the water gardens

268
00:20:39,596 --> 00:20:42,197
Staring at the sky
and doing nothing.

269
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:44,765
Oberyn was slain
during a trial by combat.

270
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:46,401
By law,
that is not murder.

271
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:48,987
Your brother.
You don't have
to remind me.

272
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,623
He was my brother long before
he was anything to you.

273
00:20:51,658 --> 00:20:53,825
What will you do
about his death?

274
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,294
I will bury him.
I will mourn for him.

275
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:58,963
And then?
You would
have me go to war?

276
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:00,615
The whole country
would have you go to war.

277
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,635
Then we are lucky
the whole country
does not decide.

278
00:21:05,672 --> 00:21:07,555
The sand snakes
are with me.

279
00:21:07,591 --> 00:21:09,257
They have the love
of their people.

280
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:11,926
They will avenge
their father while
you sit here

281
00:21:11,961 --> 00:21:14,896
In your chair
doing nothing.

282
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,318
Oberyn is dead

283
00:21:20,353 --> 00:21:24,305
<i>And this lannister girl skips</i>
<i>about the water gardens</i>

284
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:28,326
Eating our food,
breathing our air.

285
00:21:28,361 --> 00:21:31,496
How many of your
brothers and sisters
do they have to kill?

286
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,699
Let me have her.

287
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:40,171
Let me send her to cersei
one finger at a time.

288
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,925
I loved my brother.

289
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,993
And you made him
very happy.

290
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:49,180
For that, you will always
have a place in my heart.

291
00:21:50,717 --> 00:21:54,435
But we do not
mutilate little girls
for vengeance.

292
00:21:54,471 --> 00:21:56,221
Not here.

293
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,139
Not while i rule.

294
00:21:59,392 --> 00:22:01,609
And how long
will that be?

295
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,694
<i>The unsullied</i>
<i>are too conspicuous.</i>

296
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,797
Anyone can see you coming
from a mile off.

297
00:22:22,832 --> 00:22:25,049
Of course you haven't found
any sons of the harpy.

298
00:22:25,085 --> 00:22:27,085
You haven't, have you?

299
00:22:28,588 --> 00:22:31,756
My second sons,
on the other hand,

300
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:35,093
They drink,
they whore,

301
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,877
Fight in the streets,

302
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:38,346
They blend in.

303
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:40,682
They overhear
things in taverns,

304
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:44,269
Follow people
from the taverns
to nice, quiet alleys,

305
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,487
Break a few fingers,

306
00:22:46,523 --> 00:22:48,690
Overhear
a few more things.

307
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,659
Before you know it...

308
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:13,464
No one here.

309
00:23:13,516 --> 00:23:15,016
We go.

310
00:23:15,051 --> 00:23:17,935
In a hurry?
You're afraid?

311
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,937
Unsullied fear nothing.

312
00:23:19,973 --> 00:23:21,939
Right.

313
00:23:21,975 --> 00:23:23,775
That's your problem.

314
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,144
You understood fear
once long ago,

315
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,928
But you've forgotten
what it means.

316
00:23:27,947 --> 00:23:31,699
Someone who's
forgotten fear

317
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:33,484
Has forgotten how to hide.

318
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,488
<i></i>

319
00:23:42,078 --> 00:23:44,495
Fear is useful
that way.

320
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,800
<i></i>

321
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:12,473
Sons of the harpy,
they want to put a collar
back on my neck.

322
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,808
On all of our necks.

323
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,660
Please, your grace,
you must kill him.

324
00:24:15,695 --> 00:24:16,994
It would send a message.

325
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,947
I think you should
exercise restraint,
your grace.

326
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:22,817
Why?
For one thing, he may have
valuable information.

327
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,820
The son of the harpy
has no more valuable
information.

328
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,121
How do you know that?

329
00:24:27,156 --> 00:24:29,123
Because i questioned him.

330
00:24:29,158 --> 00:24:31,209
And the information
you did get,

331
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,960
He is young and poor.
He is born free.

332
00:24:33,012 --> 00:24:35,179
Why should he want
to bring back slavery?
What did it do for him?

333
00:24:35,215 --> 00:24:36,931
Perhaps the only thing
that gave him pride

334
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:38,666
Was knowing
that there was someone
lower than he was.

335
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,134
They pay him.

336
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:41,769
Great families
afraid to do a thing.

337
00:24:41,805 --> 00:24:43,938
They pay poor man
to do it for them.

338
00:24:43,973 --> 00:24:45,556
And how do you know this?
Everyone know this.

339
00:24:45,642 --> 00:24:47,525
I don't know it
and i'm the head
of a great family.

340
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,194
<i>We do not know what</i>
<i>this man did or didn't do.</i>

341
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,198
Give him a trial at least.
A fair trial.

342
00:24:54,234 --> 00:24:56,183
Show all the citizens
of meereen

343
00:24:56,202 --> 00:24:58,319
That you're better than
those who would depose you.

344
00:24:58,354 --> 00:24:59,987
Teach them a better way.

345
00:25:00,022 --> 00:25:02,490
I do not know
the place from where
old ser comes.

346
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:05,626
Things maybe are
different there, i hope.

347
00:25:05,662 --> 00:25:07,829
But here in meereen,

348
00:25:07,864 --> 00:25:10,698
Before daenerys stormborn,
they own us.

349
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,884
So we learn
much about them

350
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:15,253
Or we do not live long.

351
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,555
They teach me
what they are.

352
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,893
Mercy, fair trial--
these mean nothing to them.

353
00:25:21,928 --> 00:25:24,395
All they understand
is blood.

354
00:25:29,068 --> 00:25:31,519
<i>Thank you all</i>
<i>for your counsel.</i>

355
00:25:39,662 --> 00:25:42,396
Your grace,
a word, please,
i beg you.

356
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,949
About what?
About your father.

357
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,368
About the mad king.
The mad king?

358
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,870
You're here to remind me
of my enemies' lies?

359
00:25:48,905 --> 00:25:50,338
Consider me reminded.

360
00:25:50,373 --> 00:25:54,208
Your grace, i served
in his kingsguard.

361
00:25:54,243 --> 00:25:56,294
I was at his side
from the first.

362
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,963
Your enemies did not lie.

363
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:02,133
Go on.

364
00:26:03,636 --> 00:26:06,521
When the people rose
in revolt against him,

365
00:26:06,556 --> 00:26:09,924
Your father set their towns
and castles aflame.

366
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:13,444
He murdered sons
in front of their fathers.

367
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,646
He burned men alive
with wildfire

368
00:26:15,698 --> 00:26:18,733
And laughed
as they screamed.

369
00:26:18,768 --> 00:26:22,403
<i>And his efforts</i>
<i>to stamp out dissent</i>

370
00:26:22,438 --> 00:26:26,824
Led to rebellion
that killed every
targaryen except two.

371
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,460
I'm not my father.

372
00:26:29,496 --> 00:26:32,880
No, your grace.
Thank the gods.

373
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:37,134
But the mad king gave
his enemies the justice
he thought they deserved.

374
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:41,255
And each time,
it made him feel
powerful and right.

375
00:26:42,425 --> 00:26:43,841
Until the very end.

376
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,848
I will not have the son
of the harpy executed

377
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,767
Without a fair trial.

378
00:26:55,972 --> 00:26:58,322
Your grace.

379
00:26:58,358 --> 00:27:00,608


380
00:27:07,116 --> 00:27:09,033
There's a bug.

381
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,501
Yes, best be careful.

382
00:27:10,537 --> 00:27:13,004
You might accidently
consume some solid food.

383
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,206
When i agreed
to come with you,

384
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:18,042
Did i misrepresent
my intentions?

385
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:25,466
Besides, what else
is there for me to do

386
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:27,351
Inside this fucking box?

387
00:27:27,387 --> 00:27:29,303
You don't like it?
I want to take a walk.

388
00:27:29,355 --> 00:27:30,471
<i>You can't.</i>

389
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,939
Cersei has offered
a lordship

390
00:27:31,975 --> 00:27:34,174
To the man
who brings her
your head.

391
00:27:34,193 --> 00:27:36,143
She ought to offer
her cunt.

392
00:27:36,178 --> 00:27:38,980
Best part of her
for the best part of me.

393
00:27:39,015 --> 00:27:42,867
Well, i suppose a box
is as good a place
for me as anywhere.

394
00:27:42,902 --> 00:27:46,037
Are we really going
to spend the entire
road to volantis

395
00:27:46,072 --> 00:27:48,039
Talking about
the futility of everything?

396
00:27:48,074 --> 00:27:50,157
You're right.
No point.

397
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:52,326
<i>The road to volantis?</i>

398
00:27:52,361 --> 00:27:55,296
You said we were
going to meereen.
What's in volantis?

399
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:56,797
The road to meereen.

400
00:27:56,833 --> 00:28:00,301
And what do you hope
to find at the end of
the road to meereen?

401
00:28:00,336 --> 00:28:02,536
I told you.
A ruler.

402
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,639
We've already got
a ruler.

403
00:28:04,674 --> 00:28:07,341
Everywhere has already
got a ruler.

404
00:28:07,393 --> 00:28:10,311
Every pile of shit
on the side of every road

405
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:12,212
Has someone's banner
hanging from it.

406
00:28:12,231 --> 00:28:16,267
You were quite good,
you know, at ruling.

407
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,936
During your brief
tenure as hand.

408
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,905
I didn't rule.
I was a servant.

409
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,407
Still, a man of talent.

410
00:28:23,443 --> 00:28:24,909
Managed to kill
a lot of people.

411
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:29,080
Yes, but you showed
great promise in other
areas as well.

412
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:35,119
She wanted me
to leave king's landing.

413
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,254
She begged me.

414
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,739
I wouldn't go.

415
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,291
Why?

416
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,460
'cause i liked it.

417
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:46,263
Power.
Even as a servant.

418
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:49,300
People follow leaders.

419
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,385
And they will never
follow us.

420
00:28:51,437 --> 00:28:53,270
They find us repulsive.

421
00:28:53,306 --> 00:28:54,772
I find us repulsive.

422
00:28:54,807 --> 00:28:56,641
And we find them repulsive,

423
00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:00,260
Which is why we surround
ourselves with large,
comfortable boxes

424
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,063
To keep them away.

425
00:29:02,098 --> 00:29:04,115
And yet,

426
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,600
No matter what we do,

427
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:10,821
People like you and me
are never really satisfied
inside the box.

428
00:29:10,873 --> 00:29:13,324
<i>Not for long.</i>

429
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,376
You're right.

430
00:29:15,411 --> 00:29:17,912
Let's go for a walk.
No.

431
00:29:17,947 --> 00:29:20,998
How many dwarves
are there in the world?

432
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,384
Is cersei going
to kill them all?

433
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,755
<i></i>

434
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,640
Not him.

435
00:29:29,676 --> 00:29:31,509
Are you trying
to deceive your queen?

436
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,061
Shall i throw them
in a cell, your grace?

437
00:29:34,097 --> 00:29:35,963
That won't be necessary,
ser meryn.

438
00:29:36,015 --> 00:29:38,599
I don't want to dissuade
the other hunters.

439
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,601
Mistakes will be made.

440
00:29:40,636 --> 00:29:42,436
Thank you,
your grace, thank you.
Your grace, thank you.

441
00:29:42,471 --> 00:29:44,238
Take the head.
Pardon me, your grace.

442
00:29:44,273 --> 00:29:46,157
I would take it
if you don't mind.

443
00:29:46,192 --> 00:29:48,943
It could prove useful
for my work.

444
00:29:48,978 --> 00:29:50,611
Very good.

445
00:29:53,482 --> 00:29:55,750
Over there
will be fine.

446
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,336
You heard the man.
Over there.

447
00:29:59,372 --> 00:30:01,505
<i></i>

448
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,482
You're the hand
of the king?

449
00:30:28,534 --> 00:30:30,151
No, uncle.

450
00:30:30,186 --> 00:30:31,452
Clearly it would not
be appropriate

451
00:30:31,487 --> 00:30:33,687
For a woman
to assume that role.

452
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,906
I'm merely advising my son
until he comes of age

453
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:37,524
And chooses a hand
for himself.

454
00:30:37,543 --> 00:30:41,162
Your grace, i would
be willing to serve
provisionally

455
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,297
As the king's hand
until he becomes
old enough--

456
00:30:43,332 --> 00:30:44,865
You're a good man,
lord tyrell,

457
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,051
But i don't imagine
you'll have the time.

458
00:30:47,086 --> 00:30:49,086
In addition to being
master of ships,

459
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:52,223
The king
has appointed you
master of coin.

460
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:54,558
Oh, your grace.

461
00:30:54,594 --> 00:30:56,343
He called your experience
and wisdom

462
00:30:56,378 --> 00:30:58,545
In financial matters
unparalleled.

463
00:30:58,564 --> 00:31:01,065
He said he would
be honored to have you

464
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,850
Represent the crown's
interests in the same.

465
00:31:02,885 --> 00:31:04,935
The honor is all mine,
your grace.

466
00:31:04,987 --> 00:31:08,072
Your grace, in the past
on several occasions,

467
00:31:08,107 --> 00:31:11,025
A grand maester has served
as the king's hand.

468
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:15,529
The king has named qyburn
the new master of whisperers.

469
00:31:17,116 --> 00:31:19,950
Your grace, him?
This-- this man?

470
00:31:20,002 --> 00:31:23,420
This embarrassment
to the citadel?

471
00:31:23,456 --> 00:31:26,841
Your grace,
what qualifications

472
00:31:26,876 --> 00:31:28,793
Can he possibly have
for this post?

473
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,545
The qualification
of loyalty, grand maester.

474
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,631
That's far more
than the eunuch ever had.

475
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,350
Far more than many
ever have.

476
00:31:36,385 --> 00:31:39,086
I must say,
i cannot see--

477
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,522
Uncle kevan, in light
of your position

478
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:43,357
As commander
of the lannister armies,

479
00:31:43,392 --> 00:31:46,861
It would please the king
if you would serve as his
master of war.

480
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:50,030
No man living
better deserves
the title.

481
00:31:50,066 --> 00:31:52,399
That is kind
of you to say.

482
00:31:52,434 --> 00:31:54,652
I would like to hear it
from the king himself.

483
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,287
The king is very busy
at this moment.

484
00:31:56,322 --> 00:31:58,823
He should be here
learning what it means
to rule.

485
00:31:58,908 --> 00:32:00,407
He is learning.

486
00:32:00,442 --> 00:32:02,743
On this occasion,
in his capacity as ruler,

487
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,945
He's asked me to speak
on his behalf.

488
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:08,332
I returned to the capital
to pay my respects
to my brother.

489
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,919
And to you.
And to serve the king.

490
00:32:11,954 --> 00:32:13,971
I did not return
to the capital

491
00:32:14,006 --> 00:32:15,472
To serve as your puppet.

492
00:32:15,508 --> 00:32:19,343
To watch you stack
the small council
with sycophants.

493
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,979
Sending your own brother
away so he wouldn't be--

494
00:32:22,014 --> 00:32:23,731
My brother has left
the capital to lead

495
00:32:23,766 --> 00:32:25,683
A sensitive
diplomatic mission.

496
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,767
What mission?

497
00:32:26,802 --> 00:32:29,770
That is not your concern
as master of war.

498
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,107
I do not recognize
your authority

499
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:36,243
To dictate what is
and is not my concern.

500
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:40,030
You are the queen mother,
nothing more.

501
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,287
You would abandon your king
in his time of need?

502
00:32:46,322 --> 00:32:49,707
If he wants to send for me,
i will be waiting for him.

503
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,926
At casterly rock.

Sssnake. S.

509
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,481
It's an s.
Right, very good.

510
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:16,617
Huh!

511
00:33:16,652 --> 00:33:19,153
Did you know that the youngest
lord commander in history

512
00:33:19,188 --> 00:33:21,538
Osric stark was elected
at the age of 10?

513
00:33:23,326 --> 00:33:25,292
I know s.

514
00:33:25,328 --> 00:33:27,077
You'll learn,
i promise.

515
00:33:27,129 --> 00:33:30,164
I taught ser davos,
and old people are terrible
at learning new things.

516
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:33,500
Well, you're
a wonderful teacher.

517
00:33:33,552 --> 00:33:35,035
Very patient.

518
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,888
I only said
that the more time
that you spend practicing,

519
00:33:37,924 --> 00:33:39,306
<i>The faster</i>
<i>you'll be able to read.</i>

520
00:33:39,342 --> 00:33:42,176
That's all right.
We're doing just fine.

521
00:33:42,211 --> 00:33:44,678
I'm sure you
and "ostrich" stark

522
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,398
<i>Have a lot to talk about.</i>

523
00:33:49,268 --> 00:33:51,852
How old were you

how to read?

524
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,553
Three.
Three?

525
00:33:53,572 --> 00:33:55,022
Who taught you,
your mother?

526
00:33:55,057 --> 00:33:58,659
No, old maester
cressen did.

527
00:33:58,694 --> 00:34:00,394
I had a lot of time
to practice.

528
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,696
My mother kept me
inside because...

529
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,900
What do you call it
in the south,

530
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,902
What happened
to your face?

531
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,788
Greyscale.

532
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,573
What do you call it
north of the wall?

533
00:34:13,592 --> 00:34:15,926
I don't know.

534
00:34:15,962 --> 00:34:17,544
But two
of my sisters had it.

535
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:19,213
They both died.

536
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,714
How did they cure you?

537
00:34:20,749 --> 00:34:22,383
I don't remember.

538
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:23,767
I was a baby.

539
00:34:23,803 --> 00:34:26,020
Lots of people came
and tried, i think.

540
00:34:26,055 --> 00:34:28,389
Whatever they did,
it went away.

541
00:34:30,192 --> 00:34:31,892
What happened
to your sisters?

542
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:38,615
My father made them
move out of the keep
into the huts outside.

543
00:34:38,651 --> 00:34:41,068
None of us were allowed
to go near them.

544
00:34:41,103 --> 00:34:45,289
But we heard them,
especially at night.

545
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:49,576
They started to sound
not like themselves.

546
00:34:49,628 --> 00:34:52,129
Did you ever see them?

547
00:34:53,115 --> 00:34:55,332
Only once
at the end.

548
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,003
They were covered
with it.

549
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,256
Their faces,
their arms.

550
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:04,675
They acted like animals.

551
00:35:06,262 --> 00:35:09,463
My father had to drag them
out to the woods on a rope.

552
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,932
What did he do with them
in the woods?

553
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,603
<i></i>

554
00:35:17,473 --> 00:35:18,939
Mother.

555
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,657
Leave us.

556
00:35:23,245 --> 00:35:24,611
Your grace.

557
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:27,981
You need to stay
away from that girl.

558
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,366
Why?
She's a wildling.

559
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,485
Her name is gilly.
She's nice.

560
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,836
I'm teaching her
to read.

561
00:35:32,872 --> 00:35:34,254
She's a wildling.

562
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,006
Your father defeated
her people.

563
00:35:36,042 --> 00:35:38,792
He executed their king
for treason.

564
00:35:38,827 --> 00:35:41,795
They could strike at him
by striking at you.

565
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,964
Gilly wouldn't do that.

566
00:35:45,267 --> 00:35:48,135
You have no idea
what people will do.

567
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,637
All your books
and you still don't know.

568
00:35:56,645 --> 00:35:58,729
<i>I ordered mance rayder</i>
<i>burned at the stake.</i>

569
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:01,615
<i>You prevented that order</i>
<i>from being carried out.</i>

570
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,201
<i>You showed mercy</i>
<i>to mance rayder.</i>

571
00:36:04,236 --> 00:36:06,737
A king's word is law.

572
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,872
Perhaps you should ask
ser davos how much mercy

573
00:36:08,908 --> 00:36:11,075
<i>I show to lawbreakers.</i>

574
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,580
Show too much kindness,
people won't fear you.

575
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,499
If they don't fear you,
they don't follow you.

576
00:36:18,534 --> 00:36:20,667
With respect,
your grace,

577
00:36:20,702 --> 00:36:24,204
The free folk
will never follow you
no matter what you do.

578
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,090
You're the man who burned
their king alive.

579
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,175
Who, then?

580
00:36:29,845 --> 00:36:31,011
You?

581
00:36:31,046 --> 00:36:33,063
No.

582
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:35,315
Only one of their own.

583
00:36:37,103 --> 00:36:39,653
Do you know
this wretched girl,

584
00:36:39,688 --> 00:36:41,155
Lyanna mormont?

585
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,990
The lord commander's niece.

586
00:36:43,025 --> 00:36:46,527
Lady of bear island
and a child of 10.

587
00:36:48,364 --> 00:36:51,031
I asked her to commit
her house to my cause.
That's her response.

588
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,201
"bear island knows no king
but the king in the north,

589
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,620
Whose name is stark."

590
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,589
That amuses you?

591
00:36:59,908 --> 00:37:02,926
I apologize, your grace.

592
00:37:02,962 --> 00:37:07,214
Northerners can be
a bit like the free folk.

593
00:37:07,249 --> 00:37:10,634
Loyal to their own.
<i> I know.</i>

594
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,719
My brother robert
went on often and loudly

595
00:37:12,754 --> 00:37:15,105
About how difficult
it was to control them.

596
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,309
Even with
your father's help.

597
00:37:22,064 --> 00:37:25,949
Tonight, the night's watch
elect a new lord commander.

598
00:37:25,985 --> 00:37:27,934
Ser alliser thorne
is going to win.

599
00:37:27,953 --> 00:37:30,270
Most likely.
Unpleasant man.

600
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,823
He thinks
you're a traitor.

601
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,959
What's your life going
to be like here at the wall
with thorne in command?

602
00:37:35,995 --> 00:37:37,628
Unpleasant, i expect.

603
00:37:37,663 --> 00:37:40,581
Your bravery
made him look weak.

604
00:37:40,616 --> 00:37:42,666
He'll punish you for it.

605
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,334
I don't punish men
for bravery.

606
00:37:44,386 --> 00:37:46,303
<i>I reward them.</i>

607
00:37:46,338 --> 00:37:49,256
I don't doubt it,
your grace.

608
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,175
But i'm a brother
of the night's watch.

609
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,677
<i>I pledged them my life,</i>
<i>my honor, my sword.</i>

610
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,263
I don't know what
i have left to give you.

611
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:58,565
You can give me
the north.

612
00:37:58,601 --> 00:38:00,651
I can't.

613
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:04,488
Even if i wanted to,
i'm a bastard,

614
00:38:04,523 --> 00:38:05,639
A snow.

615
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,808
Kneel before me.
Lay your sword
at my feet.

616
00:38:08,827 --> 00:38:12,246
Pledge me your service
and you'll rise again
as jon stark,

617
00:38:12,281 --> 00:38:14,198
<i>Lord of winterfell.</i>

618
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,788
He'll make you a stark
with the stroke of a pen?

619
00:38:21,823 --> 00:38:25,542
It's the first thing
i ever remember wanting.

620
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:28,428
I'd daydream that my father
would ask the king

621
00:38:28,464 --> 00:38:31,465
And just like that,
i would never be the bastard
of winterfell again.

622
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,101
You deserve this.
You do.

623
00:38:34,136 --> 00:38:36,803
I couldn't be
happier for you.

624
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:39,139
I'm going to refuse him.

625
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:44,478
But you'd be
lord of winterfell.

626
00:38:44,513 --> 00:38:47,030
I swore a vow
to the night's watch.

627
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:48,815
If i don't take
my own word seriously,

628
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:51,318
What sort of lord
of winterfell would i be?

629
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:59,243
Crowded. You'd think
we were serving venison stew.

630
00:39:06,335 --> 00:39:11,004
Does anyone wish
to speak for candidates

631
00:39:11,056 --> 00:39:13,840
Before we cast our tokens

632
00:39:13,926 --> 00:39:18,345
For the 998th
lord commander

633
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,013
Of the night's watch?

634
00:39:22,217 --> 00:39:24,351
Ser alliser thorne
is not just a knight,

635
00:39:24,386 --> 00:39:26,069
He's a man
of true nobility.

636
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:29,156
<i>He was acting commander</i>
<i>when the wall came</i>
<i>under attack</i>

637
00:39:29,191 --> 00:39:31,858
And led us to victory
against the wildlings.
Hear, hear.

638
00:39:31,893 --> 00:39:33,410
<i>He's a veteran</i>
<i>of 100 battles</i>

639
00:39:33,445 --> 00:39:36,730
And has been a defender
of the watch and the wall
almost all of his life.

640
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,282
<i> Aye.</i>

641
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,916
He's the only true choice.

642
00:39:39,952 --> 00:39:43,086
<i>( men cheering,</i>
<i>pounding table )</i>

643
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,424
Ser denys mallister
joined the watch as a boy

644
00:39:47,459 --> 00:39:50,427
And has served loyally
longer than any other ranger.

645
00:39:50,462 --> 00:39:53,180
Through 10 winters
he served.

646
00:39:53,215 --> 00:39:55,048
As commander
of the shadow tower,

647
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:56,767
He kept
the wildlings away.

648
00:39:56,802 --> 00:39:58,468
<i>We could do no better.</i>

649
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,521
( men cheering,
pounding table )

650
00:40:02,758 --> 00:40:04,775
<i>If there is no one else,</i>

651
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,526
<i>We will begin the voting.</i>

652
00:40:06,562 --> 00:40:09,563
<i>The triangular</i>
<i>tokens count</i>

653
00:40:09,598 --> 00:40:12,065
For ser alliser thorne.

654
00:40:12,117 --> 00:40:15,902
The square tokens
for ser denys mallister.

655
00:40:15,937 --> 00:40:19,239
<i> Each brother will--</i>
maester aemon.

656
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,327
<i>Samwell tarly.</i>
<i>Go on.</i>

657
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:27,113
Sam the slayer.

658
00:40:27,132 --> 00:40:30,167
Another wildling lover
just like his friend
jon snow.

659
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,135
How's your lady love,
slayer?

660
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:34,838
her name is gilly.

661
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,923
<i>Brother slynt</i>
<i>knows her quite well.</i>

662
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:40,177
They cowered together
in the larder during
the battle for the wall.

663
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,095
Lies!

664
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:44,964
A wildling girl,
a baby,

665
00:40:44,983 --> 00:40:46,516
And lord janos.

666
00:40:46,568 --> 00:40:49,353
I found him there
after the battle was over

667
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,771
In a puddle
of his own making.

668
00:40:55,027 --> 00:40:57,644
Whilst lord janos
was hiding

669
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,280
With the women
and children,

670
00:41:00,315 --> 00:41:02,666
Jon snow was leading.

671
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:05,085
Ser alliser
fought bravely,
it is true.

672
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,921
And when he was wounded,
it was jon who saved us.

673
00:41:07,956 --> 00:41:09,873
He took charge
of the wall's defense.

674
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,292
He killed the magnar
of the thenns.

675
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,678
He went north to deal
with mance rayder

676
00:41:14,713 --> 00:41:17,931
Knowing it almost
certainly meant
his own death.

677
00:41:21,186 --> 00:41:23,887
Before that,

678
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:27,140
He led the mission to avenge
lord commander mormont.

679
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,511
Mormont himself chose jon
to be his steward.

680
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:35,399
He saw something
in jon and now we've
all seen it, too.

681
00:41:35,484 --> 00:41:38,184
He may be young,

682
00:41:38,203 --> 00:41:40,520
But he's the commander
we turned to

683
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,988
When the night was darkest.

684
00:41:42,023 --> 00:41:45,158
<i>( men cheering,</i>
<i>pounding table )</i>

685
00:41:49,998 --> 00:41:53,383
I can't argue
with any of that.

686
00:41:54,586 --> 00:41:56,920
But who does jon snow
want to command?

687
00:41:56,972 --> 00:42:00,340
Night's watch

688
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:02,008
Or the wildlings?

689
00:42:02,043 --> 00:42:05,812
<i>Everyone knows he loved</i>
<i>a wildling girl</i>

690
00:42:05,848 --> 00:42:07,931
<i>And spoke with</i>
<i>mance rayder many times.</i>

691
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:11,718
What would have happened
in that tent between
those two old friends

692
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,987
If stannis's army
hadn't come along?

693
00:42:14,022 --> 00:42:18,492
We all saw him put
the king-beyond-the-wall
out of his misery.

694
00:42:18,527 --> 00:42:22,696
<i>Do you want to</i>
<i>choose a man who has fought</i>
<i>the wildlings all his life</i>

695
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:25,165
Or a man who makes
love to them?

696
00:42:32,674 --> 00:42:34,591
It is time.

697
00:43:20,088 --> 00:43:23,423
It appears to be
a tie, maester.

698
00:43:43,645 --> 00:43:47,330
jon snow! Jon snow!
Jon snow! Jon snow!

699
00:44:18,564 --> 00:44:21,531
You. You.

700
00:44:24,486 --> 00:44:27,487
What have you
got there?

701
00:44:29,024 --> 00:44:31,908
I said--
turn around and go.

702
00:44:33,996 --> 00:44:36,796
Turn around and go.

703
00:44:36,832 --> 00:44:38,548
That's a nice
little sword.

704
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,251
Worth 100 pieces,
a sword like that.

705
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,555
Nothing's worth
anything to dead men.

706
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,559
<i>Come on.</i>

707
00:44:49,595 --> 00:44:51,511
Quickly, go! Go!

708
00:45:04,242 --> 00:45:06,359
Who are you?

709
00:45:06,394 --> 00:45:08,078
Why were they
scared of you?

710
00:45:08,113 --> 00:45:10,363
You lost this.

711
00:45:21,209 --> 00:45:23,510
You said there was
no jaqen h'ghar here.

712
00:45:23,545 --> 00:45:25,128
There isn't.

713
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,547
A man is not
jaqen h'ghar.

714
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:32,385
Well, who are you, then?

715
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:34,270
No one.

716
00:45:34,306 --> 00:45:36,606
And that is who
a girl must become.

717
00:46:48,296 --> 00:46:50,496
<i>Why?</i>

718
00:48:30,265 --> 00:48:32,866
mhysa! Mhysa!

719
00:48:32,901 --> 00:48:34,784
Mhysa! Mhysa!

720
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,923
Mhysa! Mhysa!

721
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:59,792
Mhysa!

722
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:01,394
She should have cut off
the traitor's head

723
00:49:01,429 --> 00:49:03,129
In the great pyramid
and been done with it.

724
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,765
Which is what i keep
telling her to do to you.

725
00:49:07,602 --> 00:49:11,271
mhysa! Mhysa!

726
00:50:30,185 --> 00:50:31,734
Mhysa.

727
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,743
( quietly
speaking valyrian )

728
00:51:06,304 --> 00:51:08,805
<i> </i>
mhysa!

729
00:52:08,116 --> 00:52:10,199
<i></i>

730
00:52:12,454 --> 00:52:15,088
I'll stand guard
outside your door
tonight, your grace.

731
00:52:15,123 --> 00:52:16,956
We all guard tonight.

732
00:52:18,043 --> 00:52:19,675
Leave me.

733
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:34,640
<i></i>

734
00:52:58,917 --> 00:53:02,085
<i></i>

735
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,180
Drogon.
