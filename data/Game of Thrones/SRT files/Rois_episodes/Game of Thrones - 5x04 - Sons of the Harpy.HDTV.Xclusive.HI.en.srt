<b> Resynced and translated by Esky430
Enjoy! </b>

6
00:03:12,294 --> 00:03:13,794
Is that Estermont?

7
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:16,059
Tarth, Ser Jaime.

8
00:03:18,936 --> 00:03:20,386
The sapphire isle.

9
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:26,878
Why are we on a merchant ship?

10
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:29,108
Why not a Lannister sails?

11
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,291
This ship sent to Old Town and

12
00:03:33,321 --> 00:03:35,477
we'll get off here not
far from Sunspear.

13
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,074
Row ourselves to the
Dornish shores overnight.

14
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,800
 Have you ever been in Dorne?

15
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,323
- No.
- I Have

16
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:45,293
The Dornish are crazy.

17
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:47,032
All they want to do is fight and fuck,

18
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:50,662
- fuck and fight.
- You should be happy to go back there.

19
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:55,368
There's nothing like a good fight
to get you in the mood for fucking.

20
00:03:55,398 --> 00:03:57,690
And there's nothing like
a fuck mad Dornish girl

21
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,128
to clear your head for the next fight.

22
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:02,243
It's how the two work together.

23
00:04:02,273 --> 00:04:04,621
Now we're gonna be doing a
lot of fighting I'm sure.

24
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:05,958
Well I am.

25
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:08,997
But I don't imagine we'll get
to stick around for the rest.

26
00:04:09,027 --> 00:04:10,751
Not after we've kidnapped
their princess.

27
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:12,819
We're not kidnapping their princess,

28
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:16,199
We're rescuing my niece, 
bringing her back to her family.

29
00:04:16,408 --> 00:04:17,458
Your niece?

30
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:27,954
I've been doing this sort
of thing a long time.

31
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:29,058
I'm good at it.

32
00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:31,073
- That's why you're here
- I know.

33
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,190
Why are you here?

34
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,756
Why not send 40 mercenaries?

35
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:34,833
...or an army?

36
00:04:34,863 --> 00:04:37,006
Unlike most folks,
you've actually got one.

37
00:04:37,036 --> 00:04:39,536
Because I do not
want to start a war.

38
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:44,059
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

39
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:47,386
It has to be me.

40
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,967
If I'm putting something
like this together.

41
00:04:53,108 --> 00:04:54,358
A one-handed man

42
00:04:54,388 --> 00:04:57,635
who happens to be one of the most
recognizable faces in Westeros

43
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,515
- No...
- It has to be me.

44
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:08,237
You set your brother
free, didn't you...

45
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:12,287
I bet your sister didn't like that.

46
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:15,041
Varys, set him free.

47
00:05:19,378 --> 00:05:20,378
Well...

48
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:24,494
If you ever see that wee little fucker,

49
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,174
give him my regards.

50
00:05:29,878 --> 00:05:31,784
He murdered my father.

51
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:37,603
If I ever see him,
I'll split him in two.

52
00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:41,164
And then I'll give him your regards.

53
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,160
The Iron Bank has called in 1/10th

54
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,890
of the Crown debts.

55
00:05:52,156 --> 00:05:54,505
Given the expense of
rebuilding the royal

56
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:56,494
- roof...
- How much can the Crown afford?

57
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:57,906
With Winter coming...

58
00:05:57,936 --> 00:06:00,036
half what they ask.

59
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,288
...maybe less.

60
00:06:01,318 --> 00:06:04,191
You're Master of coin.
How do we pay them?

61
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:06,971
Well, House Tyrell
could front the money,

62
00:06:07,026 --> 00:06:08,839
The Crown would pay
us back in time

63
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,042
or I'll have words
with my daughter.

64
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,380
You have already
given us too much.

65
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:23,385
No, we must arrange better
terms with the Iron Bank.

66
00:06:23,395 --> 00:06:24,415
Absolutely.

67
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:25,527
In person.

68
00:06:27,632 --> 00:06:28,705
Me?

69
00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:32,215
We must send an envoy to the Iron
Bank, someone with importance

70
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,377
to show these bankers
our respect.

71
00:06:34,387 --> 00:06:37,498
As the King's Master of Coin, I can
thinik of no one more qualified.

72
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:39,176
I would be honored, your Grace.

73
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:43,643
The Kings expressed concern about his
father in laws safety on this voyage.

74
00:06:46,683 --> 00:06:48,401
He's ordered Ser Meryn...

75
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:50,881
to personally lead your escort.

76
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,931
A member of the Kings Guard?

77
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:57,383
- Please, I...
- Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.

78
00:06:57,413 --> 00:06:58,563
Of course, of course...

79
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,158
I'll give your regards
to the Titan of Braavos.

80
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:15,001
The small council grows
smaller and smaller

81
00:07:15,011 --> 00:07:16,184
Not small enough.

82
00:07:27,502 --> 00:07:29,742
May I offer you some
wine, your holiness?

83
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:31,784
No.

84
00:07:36,174 --> 00:07:38,404
The old High Septon would've
asked for the vintage.

85
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:41,828
I could say that our minds are
the temples to the Seven...

86
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:43,830
and should be kept clear.

87
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,088
But, truth is...

88
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,748
I don't like the taste.

89
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:52,153
How may I server you?

90
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:56,918
All over Westeros, we hear
of temples being burned...

91
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:59,228
Silence Sister's raped...

92
00:08:00,284 --> 00:08:02,631
bodies of holy men
piled in the streets.

93
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:05,237
Wars teach people to
obey the sword...

94
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:06,315
not the Gods.

95
00:08:06,345 --> 00:08:09,495
Perhaps the gods need
a sword of their own.

96
00:08:09,662 --> 00:08:12,583
In the days before the
Targaryens, the faith militant

97
00:08:12,613 --> 00:08:14,763
dispensed the justices
of the Seven.

98
00:08:14,822 --> 00:08:19,022
The faith militant was dissolved
more than two centuries ago.

99
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:22,649
If I explain the holy
purpose to my son, the King

100
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:27,844
I have no doubt he will sign a decree,
arming the believers you feel worthy.

101
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:31,698
An army that defends the bodies
and souls of the common people?

102
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:34,495
An army in service to
the Gods themselves.

103
00:08:34,785 --> 00:08:36,435
and to you, of course...

104
00:08:36,989 --> 00:08:39,064
as the chosen representative
of the Seven.

105
00:08:39,074 --> 00:08:41,024
An honor I never expected...

106
00:08:41,873 --> 00:08:43,642
or a deed ever wished for.

107
00:08:43,672 --> 00:08:45,922
And "why you were chosen.

108
00:08:47,497 --> 00:08:49,997
You and I know both
how the world works.

109
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,142
Too often, the wicked
or the wealthiest

110
00:08:52,143 --> 00:08:53,743
are beyond the reach of justice.

111
00:08:53,872 --> 00:08:57,791
The King himself can't always
punish those who deserve it most.

112
00:08:57,881 --> 00:09:00,881
All sinners are equal
before the gods.

113
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,430
What would you say if I told you of
a great sinner in our very midst

114
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:12,355
shielded by gold and privilege.

115
00:09:14,606 --> 00:09:17,106
May the Father judge in justice.

116
00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:54,765
Get up!

117
00:09:55,902 --> 00:09:57,830
Help me!    Help Me!

118
00:10:08,486 --> 00:10:09,536
Get off me!

119
00:10:18,455 --> 00:10:19,455
Shut up!

120
00:10:28,357 --> 00:10:31,791
This is Lord Petyr
Baylish's establishment.

121
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,315
Cock Suck!

122
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,110
Boy Fucker!

123
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,050
You buggering filth!

124
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:53,552
There is a special place in the
Seventh Hell for your kind.

125
00:10:53,562 --> 00:10:54,612
Please...

126
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:56,467
Please! I'll pay!

127
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,348
I... I'll pay all of you!

128
00:10:58,986 --> 00:11:00,336
Yes you will.

129
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,116
Seize him.

130
00:11:39,414 --> 00:11:41,936
Get your hands off of me!
-Sir Loras of House Tyrell...

131
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:44,553
you have broken the
laws of Gods and men.

132
00:11:45,606 --> 00:11:47,106
Who do you think you are?

133
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:49,187
Justice.

134
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,309
Why is my brother in a cell?

135
00:11:58,644 --> 00:11:59,884
I... I don't know.

136
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:02,870
I... I didn't do it.

137
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,728
We both know who did.

138
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,325
You told me she was
returning to Casterly Rock.

139
00:12:09,753 --> 00:12:11,612
You say your mothers
behind this?

140
00:12:11,642 --> 00:12:14,059
She's jealous you're
not hers anymore

141
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:16,874
aresting my brother
is her revenge.

142
00:12:17,118 --> 00:12:19,155
Aren't you and mother
getting along?

143
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:26,021
Oh, my sweet...

144
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:28,337
Sweet King.

145
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,023
Do you have any affection
for me at all?

146
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:36,139
Of course I do

147
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:38,884
you're my Queen.

148
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:43,521
I can't bear to think that my brother
is locked in some grimy cell.

149
00:12:46,355 --> 00:12:48,105
I'll set him free for you.

150
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,641
Do you promise?

151
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:59,889
I demand that Ser
Loras be freed, now.

152
00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:01,657
Did I arrest him?

153
00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:04,314
Well... no.

154
00:13:05,332 --> 00:13:07,645
But, y-you armed the
faith militant.

155
00:13:07,675 --> 00:13:10,071
You gave the High Sparrow an army!

156
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:11,854
I did.

157
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,210
And your wife has every
right to criticize.

158
00:13:17,811 --> 00:13:20,273
We can not allow fanatics to
arrest the Queens brother

159
00:13:20,303 --> 00:13:22,381
no matter his perversions.

160
00:13:23,362 --> 00:13:24,362
Then...

161
00:13:26,642 --> 00:13:28,899
Can I tell Margaery you'll
have Sir Loras released?

162
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:32,279
I told you, I'm not holding Sir Loras.

163
00:13:32,422 --> 00:13:33,572
You're the King

164
00:13:33,618 --> 00:13:35,304
I'm sure if you speak
to the High Sparrow,

165
00:13:35,334 --> 00:13:38,008
he'll release the poor boy.

166
00:13:42,814 --> 00:13:43,814
<I> Halt! </ I>

167
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,364
His Holiness is praying.

168
00:14:09,394 --> 00:14:11,244
He will not be disturbed.

169
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,443
Give the order, and we'll
clear out this rebel. .

170
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:18,232
You mean...

171
00:14:18,262 --> 00:14:19,262
kill them?

172
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:21,369
Him? The Septon?

173
00:14:21,658 --> 00:14:24,508
You'll be sending them to
meet the Gods that they love.

174
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:29,151
<I> Bastard! </I>

175
00:14:30,931 --> 00:14:32,231
<I> You are an abomination! </I>

176
00:14:37,494 --> 00:14:39,244
<I> You're born of sin! </I>

177
00:14:40,252 --> 00:14:41,552
<I> Filthy Bastard! </I>

178
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:48,546
We'll find another way.

179
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:51,769
<I> Abomination! </I>

180
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,414
My Queen?

181
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:09,526
There was no way to free Ser
Loras without violence.

182
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:12,684
You're the King of the Andals.

183
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:16,896
The Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
the Protector of the Realm.

184
00:15:17,558 --> 00:15:21,458
And you let a band of fanatics
imprison your brother by law.

185
00:15:22,428 --> 00:15:25,378
- I'm going to speak with the High Sparrow.
- Are you? When?

186
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:29,772
- I don't know...
- You don't know?

187
00:15:29,954 --> 00:15:31,724
He was praying... just now.

188
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,462
I have to send word to Grandmother.

189
00:15:38,492 --> 00:15:39,988
Will come back later?

190
00:15:42,513 --> 00:15:45,363
I need to be with my
family, Your Grace.

191
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:47,551
Of course...

192
00:15:50,821 --> 00:15:53,571
- You think highly of this boy?
- <i> Good! </i>

193
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:55,889
Lord Commander of
the Night's Watch.

194
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,612
It is a bastard by some tavern slut.

195
00:15:58,642 --> 00:16:01,126
Perhaps.
But that wasn't Ned Starks way.

196
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:08,179
I should've given you a son.

197
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,430
- Not your fault
- Who's then?

198
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,283
I gave him nothing but weakness

199
00:16:18,748 --> 00:16:19,898
and deformity.

200
00:16:21,229 --> 00:16:24,101
Those scars mean nothing
to the Lord of Light.

201
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:25,133
My Lady.

202
00:16:26,304 --> 00:16:28,640
Her father's the
Lords chosen King.

203
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,570
And her father's blood
runs through her veins.

204
00:16:40,762 --> 00:16:42,861
You march on Winterfell soon?

205
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:44,141
We must.

206
00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:46,562
To beat the Snow's.

207
00:16:47,492 --> 00:16:52,142
Once before, you put your faith
in Ser Davos and left me behind.

208
00:16:54,566 --> 00:16:56,621
I hope you won't make
that mistake again.

209
00:16:56,651 --> 00:16:57,801
I won't.

210
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,489
I need you.

211
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:05,679
You only need faith, My King.

212
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,920
And you, my lady,
what do you need?

213
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:15,225
To serve my Lord.

214
00:17:20,015 --> 00:17:21,167
Lord Ashford

215
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:28,771
Lady Caulfield

216
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:33,381
Lord Smallwood

217
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,360
- Never even heard of these people.
- They haven't heard of you either.

218
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,740
But we need men, and
they have some.

219
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:46,083
How many men does this, Lord
Mason, have to send us?

220
00:17:46,347 --> 00:17:49,097
More than Lord Webbly.

221
00:18:01,963 --> 00:18:03,413
- Not him.
- I know..

222
00:18:03,578 --> 00:18:06,619
I'm sorry.
But we need men, and supplies, and

223
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:09,311
- Roose Bolton's the Warden of the North
- He murdered my brother.

224
00:18:09,341 --> 00:18:12,918
We swore to be the
watcher's on the wall.

225
00:18:12,948 --> 00:18:16,398
We can't watch the
wall with fifty men,

226
00:18:16,707 --> 00:18:21,157
and we can't get more men without
help from the Warden of the North.

227
00:18:43,637 --> 00:18:45,287
Apologies my lady.

228
00:18:57,615 --> 00:18:58,915
Lord Commander.

229
00:18:59,864 --> 00:19:01,364
How can I help you?

230
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,680
Come with us when we ride South.

231
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:07,131
None of us know the
castle as well as you do.

232
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,510
Its hidden tunnels...

233
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,750
its weaknesses, its people.

234
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,630
Winterfell was your home once,

235
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:18,872
don't you want to chase
the rats out of it?

236
00:19:21,154 --> 00:19:23,404
Castle Black is my home now.

237
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:27,281
The Night's Watch take no part in
the wars of the Seven Kingdom's.

238
00:19:27,311 --> 00:19:28,911
There's only one war.

239
00:19:29,572 --> 00:19:31,272
Life against death.

240
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:34,473
Come...

241
00:19:34,846 --> 00:19:36,660
Let me show you what
you're fighting for.

242
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,585
You gonna show me some
vision in the fire.

243
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,220
Forgive me my lady...

244
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,200
I don't trust in visions.

245
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:45,679
No visions.

246
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,210
No magic.

247
00:19:48,262 --> 00:19:49,512
Just life...

248
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:11,977
Do you feel my heart beating?

249
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:16,743
This power in you...

250
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,521
you resisted, and that's your mistake.

251
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,588
Embrace it.

252
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,730
The Lord of Light made
us male and female.

253
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,730
Two parts of a greater whole.

254
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:40,241
You're not joining

255
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:41,757
this power.

256
00:20:42,956 --> 00:20:44,906
The power to make life.

257
00:20:45,266 --> 00:20:47,027
Power to make light.

258
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,046
And the power to cast shadows...

259
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:53,378
I don't think Stannis,
would like that very much.

260
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,770
Then we shouldn't tell.

261
00:20:57,808 --> 00:20:58,808
I can't.

262
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:00,566
Why?

263
00:21:01,489 --> 00:21:02,839
I swore a vow.

264
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,020
I loved another...

265
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:09,893
The Death don't need lovers,

266
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,190
only living.

267
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:17,677
I know...

268
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:21,137
but I still love her.

269
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:38,132
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

270
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,290
Are you lonely?

271
00:22:19,224 --> 00:22:20,224
Just bored.

272
00:22:20,254 --> 00:22:24,160
My father used to tell me that boredom
indicates a lack of inner resources.

273
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,090
Were you bored a lot too?

274
00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:28,012
I know Castle Black...

275
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:30,644
- is no place for a child. But I...
- I like it!

276
00:22:30,674 --> 00:22:32,824
I thought I'd be left at home.

277
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:35,789
I know mother didn't want to bring me.

278
00:22:36,116 --> 00:22:37,616
Why'd you say that?

279
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:41,654
She told me, "I don't
want to bring you."

280
00:22:43,564 --> 00:22:45,314
She shouldn't have said that.

281
00:22:55,321 --> 00:22:57,072
Are you ashamed of me, father?

282
00:23:08,601 --> 00:23:10,151
When you were an infant...

283
00:23:11,127 --> 00:23:13,423
A Dornish trader
landed on Dragonstone.

284
00:23:14,611 --> 00:23:18,211
His goods were junk, except for...
one wooden doll.

285
00:23:19,408 --> 00:23:22,708
We even sowed a dress on it,
in the colors of our house.

286
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:27,234
No doubt you've heard of your birth.

287
00:23:27,264 --> 00:23:30,664
And assumed new father's
were easy targets.

288
00:23:33,864 --> 00:23:37,864
I still remember how you smiled when
I put that doll in your cradle,

289
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,393
and you pressed it to your cheek.

290
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:50,444
By the time we burned the
doll, it was too late.

291
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,480
I was told you would die,

292
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:57,168
or worse...

293
00:23:58,824 --> 00:24:01,222
the grey scale would go slow.

294
00:24:01,252 --> 00:24:05,858
That you'd grow just enough to know the
world before taking it away from you.

295
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,438
Everyone advised me to send
you to the ruins of Valirya

296
00:24:08,468 --> 00:24:10,712
to live out your short
life with the Stone Men,

297
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:13,742
before the sickness spread
through the castle.

298
00:24:15,297 --> 00:24:17,859
I told them all to go to hell.

299
00:24:19,313 --> 00:24:21,913
I called in every maestro
on this side of the world.

300
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:23,359
Every Healer...

301
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,913
every Apothecary.

302
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,899
They stopped the disease
and saved your life.

303
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:34,752
Because you did not belong across the
world with the bloody Stone Men.

304
00:24:35,777 --> 00:24:38,977
You are the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

305
00:24:40,923 --> 00:24:42,273
And you are my daughter.

306
00:25:44,414 --> 00:25:46,264
I thought I might find you here.

307
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:50,665
Your Aunt Lyanna...

308
00:25:51,771 --> 00:25:53,921
Father never talked about her.

309
00:25:55,413 --> 00:25:58,913
Sometimes, I'd find him down
here lighting the candles.

310
00:26:00,056 --> 00:26:01,956
They say she was beautiful.

311
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:03,896
I saw her once.

312
00:26:03,926 --> 00:26:07,176
I was a boy, living with
your mother's family.

313
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:09,973
Lord Whent of the Great
Tourney at Arrenhal.

314
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,510
Everyone was there...

315
00:26:13,016 --> 00:26:14,116
the Mad King,

316
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:15,709
your father,

317
00:26:16,363 --> 00:26:17,663
Robert Baratheon,

318
00:26:18,796 --> 00:26:19,796
and Lyanna.

319
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:22,359
She was already
promised to Robert.

320
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:26,136
You can imagine what it was like
for me, a boy from nowhere...

321
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:27,666
nothing to his name...

322
00:26:28,322 --> 00:26:30,273
watching these legendary men

323
00:26:30,303 --> 00:26:32,203
tilting of the lists.

324
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:34,777
The last two rider's were...

325
00:26:34,807 --> 00:26:37,060
Barristan Selmy and Rheagar Targaryen.

326
00:26:37,911 --> 00:26:41,361
When Rheagar won, everyone
cheered for their Prince.

327
00:26:41,755 --> 00:26:45,813
I remember I was laughing when he took off
his helmet and they saw that silver hair.

328
00:26:45,843 --> 00:26:47,243
How handsome he was.

329
00:26:48,247 --> 00:26:50,547
Until he rode right past his wife,

330
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,320
Elia Martell,

331
00:26:52,941 --> 00:26:55,091
and all the smiles died.

332
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:59,132
Never seen so many
people so quiet.

333
00:26:59,806 --> 00:27:01,406
He rode past his wife

334
00:27:03,314 --> 00:27:06,764
and he laid a crown with
winter roses in Lyanna's lap.

335
00:27:06,868 --> 00:27:08,418
Blue was frost.

336
00:27:12,593 --> 00:27:17,243
How many tens of thousands had to die
because Rheagar chose your aunt?

337
00:27:19,216 --> 00:27:20,577
Yes... he chose them,

338
00:27:22,131 --> 00:27:23,931
and then kidnapped
her, and raped her.

339
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:33,666
Come

340
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:37,252
Let's speak somewhere
the dead can't hear us.

341
00:27:42,477 --> 00:27:43,932
Dressed for riding...

342
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:44,962
I am.

343
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:47,796
Where are you going?

344
00:27:48,489 --> 00:27:49,889
King's Landing.

345
00:27:50,577 --> 00:27:51,977
King's Landing?

346
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:54,403
Cersei sent for me.

347
00:27:54,433 --> 00:27:56,783
We mustn't let her
sniff out any trouble.

348
00:27:57,104 --> 00:27:58,754
You can't leave me here!

349
00:27:58,945 --> 00:28:02,645
You know how hard it is to get with
people you despise, believe me.

350
00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:04,879
But it won't be for long.

351
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,500
How do you know?

352
00:28:07,751 --> 00:28:10,851
Stannis Baratheon garrisons
the Castle Black.

353
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,348
He'll march South to King's Landing
before the Winter snow block his way.

354
00:28:15,378 --> 00:28:16,378
But first,

355
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,346
he has to take Winterfell.

356
00:28:18,821 --> 00:28:19,821
You don't konw that.

357
00:28:19,851 --> 00:28:20,851
I do.

358
00:28:22,137 --> 00:28:24,237
Once he liberates these
lands from the Bolton's,

359
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:26,773
he'll rally your fathers
bannermen to his cause

360
00:28:26,803 --> 00:28:28,716
with the North behind them.

361
00:28:28,746 --> 00:28:31,521
Stannis can finally
take the Iron Throne.

362
00:28:31,551 --> 00:28:34,151
You think he'll
defeat the Bolton's?

363
00:28:34,397 --> 00:28:36,002
He has a larger army,

364
00:28:36,032 --> 00:28:38,571
and the finest military
commander in Westeros.

365
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:42,251
A betting man, would put
his money on Stannis.

366
00:28:42,474 --> 00:28:45,774
As it happens, I
am a betting man.

367
00:28:46,189 --> 00:28:47,539
And if you're right?

368
00:28:47,938 --> 00:28:50,059
Stannis takes Winterfell,

369
00:28:50,089 --> 00:28:53,327
he rescues you from the most
despised family in the North.

370
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:56,337
Grateful for your late father's
courageous support of his claim...

371
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,417
he names you... 
Wardeness of the North.

372
00:28:59,742 --> 00:29:00,742
But I...

373
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:02,349
I wouldn't...

374
00:29:02,983 --> 00:29:04,376
Wardeness of the North?

375
00:29:04,406 --> 00:29:06,606
You are the last surviving Stark.

376
00:29:07,295 --> 00:29:08,645
He needs you.

377
00:29:09,376 --> 00:29:12,064
And what if you're wrong?
What if Stannis never attacked Winterfell

378
00:29:12,094 --> 00:29:14,894
or he does, and the
Bolton's defeat him?

379
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:19,179
Then you will take this Bolton boy,
Ramses, and make him yours.

380
00:29:19,268 --> 00:29:21,951
- I don't know how to do that.
- Of course you do.

381
00:29:22,454 --> 00:29:24,154
He's already fallen for you.

382
00:29:24,879 --> 00:29:26,189
His father frightens me.

383
00:29:26,219 --> 00:29:27,237
And he should...

384
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:28,867
he's a dangerous man.

385
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:33,358
But even the most dangerous
men, can be outmaneuvered.

386
00:29:33,873 --> 00:29:36,473
And you've learned to
manouver from the very best.

387
00:29:38,803 --> 00:29:40,239
I'll return before too long.

388
00:29:41,033 --> 00:29:42,683
You be strong, without me.

389
00:29:51,867 --> 00:29:53,267
The North will be yours.

390
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:56,311
Do you believe me?

391
00:29:59,409 --> 00:30:03,159
I expect I'll be a married
woman by the time you return.

392
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:07,575
Breakfast?

393
00:31:12,158 --> 00:31:14,072
That would've been
a shit way to die.

394
00:31:14,102 --> 00:31:17,196
As far as I've seen, they're
all shit ways to die.

395
00:31:17,226 --> 00:31:18,226
<I> Aye.</I>

396
00:31:18,263 --> 00:31:20,463
But your lot have to give
the singers a good ending.

397
00:31:20,493 --> 00:31:23,401
I don't care what's sung
about me when I'm dead.

398
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:24,431
No?

399
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:28,159
Two knights, off to
rescue a princess...

400
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:31,264
- sounds like a good song to me.
- Sounds like all the rest.

401
00:31:35,044 --> 00:31:36,294
What about you?

402
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,169
What shit way would you choose?

403
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:43,184
In my own Keep,
drinking my own wine.

404
00:31:43,598 --> 00:31:46,620
Watching my son's
grovel for a fortune.

405
00:31:47,118 --> 00:31:48,330
How disappointing...

406
00:31:49,612 --> 00:31:52,373
I thought you'd have something
more exciting planned.

407
00:31:53,017 --> 00:31:54,855
I've had an exciting life...

408
00:31:55,074 --> 00:31:56,835
I want my death to be boring.

409
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:00,492
And how do you want to go?

410
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,524
In the arms of the woman I love.

411
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,224
She want the same thing?

412
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:14,923
Let's go.

413
00:32:25,459 --> 00:32:27,046
The captain of that ship...

414
00:32:27,477 --> 00:32:29,859
- what was he, Braavosi?
- Pentosi?.

415
00:32:30,836 --> 00:32:33,651
- and he's headed to Old Town?
- As I said...

416
00:32:33,681 --> 00:32:34,681
Why?

417
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,299
What's to stop him from
ducking down the coast...

418
00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:39,961
I tell the locals that Jaime
Lannister's in Dorne?

419
00:32:39,971 --> 00:32:41,167
A bag of gold.

420
00:32:42,153 --> 00:32:46,480
I'm not sure you understand how much people
hate your family in this part of the world.

421
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:47,978
It was a heavy bag.

422
00:32:48,382 --> 00:32:51,344
And I bet he swore all
kinds of oaths to get it.

423
00:32:51,354 --> 00:32:54,159
But you won't be around if he breaks it.

424
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,213
- How many do you count?
- Four.

425
00:33:05,815 --> 00:33:07,573
And how many do you think you can take?

426
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,249
One... if he's slow.

427
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:20,761
Fucked in the ass.

428
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,541
Morning lads!

429
00:33:33,753 --> 00:33:35,340
Glad we found you.

430
00:33:36,082 --> 00:33:37,082
Who are you?

431
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:38,583
Cooper.

432
00:33:39,132 --> 00:33:40,415
And this is Darnell.

433
00:33:40,782 --> 00:33:43,848
- You're from King's Landing?
- Accent gave me away.

434
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,926
Flea Bottom.
Whelped and whipped.

435
00:33:48,391 --> 00:33:49,435
Why are you here?

436
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:53,536
Our ship capsized in the night.
We managed to swim ashore.

437
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:55,014
It's a near thing, really...

438
00:33:55,884 --> 00:33:58,203
Thought the sharks would get us.

439
00:33:59,033 --> 00:34:00,793
There are no sharks in Dorne.

440
00:34:02,575 --> 00:34:05,249
I could've sworn those
were shark fins.

441
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,690
Dolphin's, maybe.

442
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,309
Throw your sword in the sand!

443
00:34:11,319 --> 00:34:13,472
Boys, there's no need for this.

444
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:17,682
Just point us in the right direction,
and we'll find our way home.

445
00:34:17,948 --> 00:34:20,348
Swords in the sand, now!

446
00:34:48,115 --> 00:34:50,355
That one should be slow enough.

447
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:44,808
Nice move.

448
00:35:47,217 --> 00:35:48,283
...Luck!

449
00:35:49,196 --> 00:35:51,044
You had a wonderful teacher.

450
00:36:04,874 --> 00:36:07,196
I always wanted a
Dornish stallion.

451
00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:11,502
Beasts can run a day and
night without tiring.

452
00:36:11,646 --> 00:36:14,713
We'll ride to the Water Garden's
with a nice breeze in our face.

453
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:16,969
But first, we need to
bury these bodies.

454
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:18,841
Birds have to eat too.

455
00:36:18,851 --> 00:36:21,149
Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies.

456
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:23,355
We're not here to start a war.

457
00:36:23,766 --> 00:36:26,571
Do you know how long it will
take us to dig all those hole's?

458
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,008
I can't dig very well with one hand.

459
00:36:30,118 --> 00:36:31,705
Not at all, really.

460
00:37:02,552 --> 00:37:03,827
Momma.

461
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,879
- Nym... Obara
- Will it be war?

462
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:16,388
Prince Doran will weep for
your father, but nothing else.

463
00:37:16,398 --> 00:37:18,464
We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.

464
00:37:18,929 --> 00:37:22,031
Without Doran, we have no army to
march against the Lannister's.

465
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:25,659
We don't need an
army to start a war.

466
00:37:25,819 --> 00:37:28,885
Queen Cersei loves her children...

467
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:32,096
- ...and we have one of them.
- We may have a problem.

468
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,938
A ship's captain, who found
me at Planky Town, claiming

469
00:37:40,948 --> 00:37:42,802
he had information to sell.

470
00:37:43,513 --> 00:37:46,639
He told me he smuggled Jaime
Lannister into Dorne.

471
00:37:48,304 --> 00:37:49,826
He's come for Myrcella.

472
00:37:51,259 --> 00:37:55,194
If he gets to her before we do, we
lose our only chance for revenge.

473
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,757
You must choose...

474
00:37:59,003 --> 00:38:01,069
Doran's way and peace,

475
00:38:01,183 --> 00:38:02,669
or my way...

476
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,316
and war.

477
00:38:06,749 --> 00:38:08,846
I'm with you. Always.

478
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:10,686
Nym?

479
00:38:15,686 --> 00:38:16,724
Obara?

480
00:38:18,243 --> 00:38:21,565
When I was a child, Oberyn
came to take me to court.

481
00:38:22,096 --> 00:38:25,833
I'd never seen this man, and yet
he called himself my father.

482
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:29,431
My mother wept, said
I was too young,

483
00:38:29,536 --> 00:38:30,683
and a girl.

484
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,159
Oberyn tossed his spear
at my feet and said

485
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:39,350
"Girl or boy, we
fight our battles.

486
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,272
But the God's let us
choose our weapons."

487
00:38:42,735 --> 00:38:44,962
My father pointed to the spear,

488
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,074
then to my mother's tears.

489
00:38:54,898 --> 00:38:57,051
I made my choice long ago.

490
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:32,194
Thank you.

491
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:42,023
Who are you?

492
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,324
Your capture.

493
00:39:46,581 --> 00:39:47,764
Do you have wine?

494
00:39:48,043 --> 00:39:49,054
No.

495
00:39:50,228 --> 00:39:51,764
I can't sleep without wine.

496
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:53,377
Then stay awake.

497
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:01,733
You're going the wrong way.

498
00:40:02,827 --> 00:40:05,240
My sister's in Westeros.

499
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,851
Westeros... is West!

500
00:40:07,881 --> 00:40:09,608
We're heading East...

501
00:40:09,847 --> 00:40:11,869
I'm not taking you
to your sister.

502
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:15,610
You said you were
taking me to the Queen.

503
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,714
I am.

504
00:40:16,911 --> 00:40:18,672
Queen Daenerys Targaryen.

505
00:40:19,106 --> 00:40:20,667
She's the Queen I serve.

506
00:40:27,597 --> 00:40:29,895
What a waste of a
good kidnapping.

507
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:33,393
So happens I was
heading there myself!

508
00:40:33,423 --> 00:40:35,896
What business would you
have with the Queen?

509
00:40:35,897 --> 00:40:36,908
Gold and glory?

510
00:40:37,158 --> 00:40:38,383
Oh, and hate.

511
00:40:39,281 --> 00:40:41,607
If you've ever met my
sister, you'd understand.

512
00:40:42,724 --> 00:40:43,724
So...

513
00:40:43,754 --> 00:40:46,385
now that it's clear
we're on the same side.

514
00:40:56,427 --> 00:40:59,375
A high born knight from
the North of Westeros,

515
00:40:59,405 --> 00:41:01,829
down on his luck in Essos.

516
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:03,999
Dragon epaulettes?

517
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:06,158
Bear sigil breast fit.

518
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:08,514
You're Jorah Mormont.

519
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,023
I have to ask...

520
00:41:12,313 --> 00:41:14,760
how, exactly, were you
serving your Queen

521
00:41:14,761 --> 00:41:17,088
in a whore house,
half a world away?

522
00:41:17,566 --> 00:41:19,943
Is it possible, that
you were running?

523
00:41:21,044 --> 00:41:22,631
Why would you be running?

524
00:41:22,964 --> 00:41:24,899
And why would she
have sent you away?

525
00:41:25,808 --> 00:41:27,044
Oh, wait!

526
00:41:28,227 --> 00:41:30,365
You were spying on
her, weren't you?

527
00:41:31,612 --> 00:41:33,206
It's all coming back to me!

528
00:41:33,315 --> 00:41:37,271
I was drunk through most of the small
council meetings, but it's all coming back

529
00:41:37,301 --> 00:41:39,979
You passed notes to
Varys' little birds.

530
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:43,847
She found out, didn't she?

531
00:41:44,624 --> 00:41:46,534
Found out, and exiled you.

532
00:41:48,115 --> 00:41:51,191
And now you hope to win
back her favor with a gift.

533
00:41:52,981 --> 00:41:54,358
A risky scheme...

534
00:41:55,329 --> 00:41:57,301
one might even say, desperate.

535
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:02,337
Do you think Daenerys would
execute me, and pardon you?

536
00:42:03,994 --> 00:42:06,364
I'd say the reverse
is just as likely.

537
00:42:28,031 --> 00:42:30,184
Everyone looks happy
enough from up here.

538
00:42:32,089 --> 00:42:33,107
What?

539
00:42:34,153 --> 00:42:36,292
I was thinking of all the
times your brother made me

540
00:42:36,322 --> 00:42:40,075
go with him down from the Red Keep,
into the streets of King's Landing.

541
00:42:40,105 --> 00:42:42,650
- Why?
- He liked to walk among the people,

542
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,310
he liked to sing to them.

543
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,278
- He sang to them?
- Yes. (laughs)

544
00:42:48,494 --> 00:42:50,964
Rhaegar would take a
spot on the hook

545
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,636
or ithe street of seeds...
and then he'd sang.

546
00:42:54,269 --> 00:42:55,764
Just like all the
other minstrels.

547
00:42:55,794 --> 00:42:58,701
- And what did you do?
- I made sure no one killed him.

548
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,463
And... I collected the money.

549
00:43:02,139 --> 00:43:04,182
Well... he liked to see
how much he could make.

550
00:43:04,212 --> 00:43:06,113
- He was good?
- He was very good.

551
00:43:06,143 --> 00:43:07,431
Viserys never told you?

552
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:10,462
He told me Rhaegar was
good at killing people.

553
00:43:11,182 --> 00:43:12,897
Rhaegar never liked killing...

554
00:43:12,927 --> 00:43:14,141
he loved to sing.

555
00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:16,093
And what did you
do with the money?

556
00:43:16,123 --> 00:43:19,467
Well, one time, we gave it to the
next minstrel down the street.

557
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:22,113
One time, he gave it to an
orphanage in Flea Bottom.

558
00:43:22,143 --> 00:43:23,545
One time...

559
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,728
he got horribly drunk.

560
00:43:27,552 --> 00:43:28,757
Your Grace.

561
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:33,055
Hizdahr is here, waiting
in the audience chamber.

562
00:43:34,249 --> 00:43:35,315
How many others are there?

563
00:43:35,962 --> 00:43:37,747
Fifty... a hundred.

564
00:43:38,526 --> 00:43:40,186
Will you be joining
us, Ser Barristan?

565
00:43:40,216 --> 00:43:43,778
I... think I can protect
you from Hizdhar Zo Loraq.

566
00:43:43,878 --> 00:43:46,900
I think I can protect me
from Hizdhar Zo Loraq.

567
00:43:47,837 --> 00:43:49,164
Go, Ser Barristan.

568
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:50,753
Sing a song for me.

569
00:43:51,435 --> 00:43:52,618
Your Grace.

570
00:43:58,113 --> 00:43:59,637
<I> All men must die. </I>

571
00:43:59,807 --> 00:44:02,403
- But not all can die in glory.
- Glory?

572
00:44:02,433 --> 00:44:03,925
Why else do men fight?

573
00:44:03,955 --> 00:44:07,445
Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow
Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

574
00:44:07,475 --> 00:44:10,068
So their names would live on.

575
00:44:10,098 --> 00:44:12,917
Those who find victory in the fighting
pits, will never become kings...

576
00:44:12,947 --> 00:44:14,830
but their names will live on.

577
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:16,941
It's the best chance
they'll ever have.

578
00:44:17,184 --> 00:44:19,422
Is that what you used to tell men
before you set them to

579
00:44:19,452 --> 00:44:21,501
butchering each other for sport?

580
00:44:21,531 --> 00:44:24,391
His Grace, today is the traditional
start of the fighting season.

581
00:44:24,421 --> 00:44:26,145
I do not recognize this tradition.

582
00:44:26,175 --> 00:44:29,347
Traditions, are the only thing
that will hold this city...

583
00:44:29,523 --> 00:44:31,061
your city, together.

584
00:44:33,098 --> 00:44:36,491
Without them, former slaves and former
masters have nothing in common.

585
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:41,660
Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment.

586
00:44:42,938 --> 00:44:46,199
I can't promise this is the
answer to all our problems...

587
00:44:46,977 --> 00:44:48,249
...but it's a start.

588
00:45:25,179 --> 00:45:27,017
