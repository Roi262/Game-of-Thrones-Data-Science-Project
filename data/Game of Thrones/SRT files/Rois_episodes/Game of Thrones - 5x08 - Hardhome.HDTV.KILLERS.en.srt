1
00:00:05,885 --> 00:00:09,885


2
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:13,909


3
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:15,933


4
00:00:15,957 --> 00:00:17,957


5
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:50,532


6
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:58,530


7
00:02:04,136 --> 00:02:06,805
Your Grace,
I want to say...

8
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:08,773
You will not speak.

9
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,710
How do I know you are
who you say you are?

10
00:02:12,745 --> 00:02:15,547
If only I were otherwise.

11
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:18,349
If you are Tyrion Lannister,
why shouldn't I kill you

12
00:02:18,384 --> 00:02:20,685
to pay your family back
for what it did to mine?

13
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,388
You want revenge
against the Lannisters?

14
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:25,790
I killed my mother
Joanna Lannister

15
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:27,659
on the day I was born.

16
00:02:27,693 --> 00:02:31,229
I killed my father Tywin Lannister with
a bolt to the heart.

17
00:02:31,263 --> 00:02:33,898
I am the greatest
Lannister killer of our time.

18
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:36,067
So I should welcome you
into my service

19
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:38,336
because you murdered members
of your own family?

20
00:02:39,572 --> 00:02:42,106
Into your service?

21
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:45,076
Your Grace, we have
only just met.

22
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,445
It's too soon to know
if you deserve my service.

23
00:02:47,513 --> 00:02:50,315
If you'd rather return
to the fighting pits,

24
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:52,584
just say the word.

25
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,255
When I was a young man,
I heard a story

26
00:02:57,289 --> 00:03:00,758
about a baby born
during the worst storm in living memory.

27
00:03:00,793 --> 00:03:02,794
She had no wealth,
no lands, no army,

28
00:03:02,828 --> 00:03:06,231
<i>only a name</i>
<i>and a handful of supporters,

29
00:03:06,265 --> 00:03:09,767
most of whom probably thought they
could use that name to benefit themselves.

30
00:03:09,802 --> 00:03:12,370
They kept her alive,
moving her from place to place,

31
00:03:12,404 --> 00:03:15,573
<i>often hours ahead of the men</i>
<i>who'd been sent to kill her.

32
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:18,910
<i>She was eventually sold off to</i>
<i>some warlord on the edge of the world

33
00:03:18,978 --> 00:03:21,179
<i>and that appeared</i>
<i>to be that.

34
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:23,214
<i>And then</i>
<i>a few years later,

35
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:25,550
the most well-informed
person I knew

36
00:03:25,618 --> 00:03:28,453
told me that this girl
without wealth, lands, or armies

37
00:03:28,487 --> 00:03:31,689
had somehow acquired all three
in a very short span of time,

38
00:03:31,724 --> 00:03:33,725
along with three dragons.

39
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,793
<i>He thought</i>
<i>she was our best,

40
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:38,730
<i>last chance to build</i>
<i>a better world.

41
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:42,867
I thought you were worth
meeting at the very least.

42
00:03:42,902 --> 00:03:44,369
And why are you
worth meeting?

43
00:03:44,403 --> 00:03:46,204
Why should I spend
my time listening to you?

44
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:49,340
Because you cannot build
a better world on your own.

45
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,777
You have no one at your side who
understands the land you want to rule.

46
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:54,812
The strengths
and weaknesses of the houses

47
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:56,147
<i>that will either</i>
<i>join or oppose you.

48
00:03:56,181 --> 00:03:59,183
I will have
a very large army

49
00:03:59,218 --> 00:04:00,785
and very large dragons.

50
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:04,389
Killing and politics
aren't always the same thing.

51
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:06,357
When I served
as Hand of the King,

52
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:09,027
I did quite well with the latter
considering the king in question

53
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:11,362
preferred torturing animals
to leading his people.

54
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:14,465
I could do
an even better job

55
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,768
advising a ruler
worth the name.

56
00:04:16,802 --> 00:04:19,170
<i>If that is indeed</i>
<i>what you are.

57
00:04:19,204 --> 00:04:21,472
So you want
to advise me?

58
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:25,710
Very well.

59
00:04:27,112 --> 00:04:28,646
What would you
have me do with him?

60
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:34,085
<i>I swore I would kill him</i>
<i>if he ever returned.

61
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:36,020
I know.

62
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:43,394
Why should the people
trust a queen who can't keep her promises?

63
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:49,200
Whomever Ser Jorah
was when he started informing on you,

64
00:04:49,234 --> 00:04:52,303
he is no longer that man.

65
00:04:52,338 --> 00:04:54,372
I can't remember
ever seeing a sane man

66
00:04:54,473 --> 00:04:56,774
as devoted to anything
as he is to serving you.

67
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:59,877
<i>He claims he would kill</i>
<i>for you and die for you

68
00:04:59,912 --> 00:05:02,614
<i>and nothing I ever witnessed</i>
<i>gives me reason to doubt him.

69
00:05:06,552 --> 00:05:08,686
And yet he did
betray you.

70
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,801
Did he have an opportunity
to confess his betrayal?

71
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:26,070
Yes.

72
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:28,139
Many opportunities.

73
00:05:28,207 --> 00:05:30,808
<i>And did he?

74
00:05:30,843 --> 00:05:35,213
No, not until
forced to do so.

75
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:41,853
He worships you.

76
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:44,689
He is in love
with you, I think.

77
00:05:44,723 --> 00:05:47,025
<i>But he did not trust you</i>
<i>with the truth.

78
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:48,559
<i>An unpleasant truth</i>
<i>to be sure,

79
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:51,062
<i>but one of great</i>
<i>significance to you.

80
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:54,232
<i>He did not trust that you would</i>
<i>be wise enough to forgive him.

81
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:57,268
So I should kill him?

82
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,638
A ruler who kills
those devoted to her

83
00:06:00,673 --> 00:06:03,374
is not a ruler
who inspires devotion.

84
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:05,576
And you're going to need
to inspire devotion,

85
00:06:05,611 --> 00:06:09,447
a lot of it, if you're ever going to rule
across the Narrow Sea.

86
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:14,352
But you cannot have him
by your side when you do.

87
00:06:19,725 --> 00:06:22,060
Remove Ser Jorah
from the city.

88
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:21,786


89
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:34,799
Confess.

90
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,068
My son.

91
00:07:38,704 --> 00:07:41,139
Let me speak to...

92
00:07:41,173 --> 00:07:42,440
Confess.

93
00:07:42,474 --> 00:07:44,375
I meant it.

94
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:48,179
My face will be
the last thing you see...

95
00:07:53,886 --> 00:07:56,187


96
00:07:58,056 --> 00:08:00,625


97
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:04,462


98
00:08:04,496 --> 00:08:08,199
My name is Lanna.
I'm an orphan.

99
00:08:09,802 --> 00:08:11,736
<i>When I was eight,</i>
<i>I begged enough money

100
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,771
<i>to buy my first</i>
<i>bucket of oysters.

101
00:08:13,806 --> 00:08:18,109
I sold that bucket and made
enough money to buy two more.

102
00:08:18,143 --> 00:08:20,044


103
00:08:20,078 --> 00:08:23,581
<i>It took a while,</i>
<i>but I finally saved enough

104
00:08:23,615 --> 00:08:25,716
<i>to buy myself</i>
<i>an oyster cart.

105
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:27,552
<i>Now every morning,

106
00:08:27,586 --> 00:08:29,687
<i>I make my way</i>
<i>down to the canals.

107
00:08:31,723 --> 00:08:34,959
<i>I pass the fish mongers</i>
<i>and the bakers.

108
00:08:40,032 --> 00:08:41,699
<i>I usually see Lhara,

109
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:44,769
<i>my first customer of the day</i>
<i>on her way home.

110
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:49,574
<i>Then I turn left</i>
<i>onto Moonsinger Lane

111
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:52,009


112
00:08:52,044 --> 00:08:55,179
Turn left
onto Ragman Lane

113
00:08:55,214 --> 00:08:56,714
where I do
most of my trade.

114
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:58,983
Lanna is very impressive.

115
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:01,686
Very industrious.

116
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,422
She will make a fine servant
for the Many-Faced God.

117
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:06,457
How will she serve him?

118
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:09,927
She will no longer
turn left onto Ragman Lane.

119
00:09:09,962 --> 00:09:12,363
She will turn right
and go to Ragman Harbor.

120
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:13,965
What will she do there?

121
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:16,033
She will see.

122
00:09:16,068 --> 00:09:18,970
<i>See what?

123
00:09:19,004 --> 00:09:21,539
<i>How can a man</i>
<i>tell a girl this?

124
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:22,840
<i>If he knew</i>
<i>what she would see,

125
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,343
<i>there would be</i>
<i>no reason to send her.

126
00:09:25,377 --> 00:09:28,012
Oysters, clams,
and cockles!

127
00:09:32,584 --> 00:09:33,618


128
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:48,266
Oysters, clams,
and cockles!

129
00:09:56,308 --> 00:09:59,677
Oysters, clams,
and cockles!

130
00:09:59,711 --> 00:10:02,780
Your oysters fresh?

131
00:10:02,814 --> 00:10:04,448
Best in the city.

132
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:06,584
You wouldn't lie
to an old man, would you?

133
00:10:19,498 --> 00:10:21,532
Mm.

134
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:25,403
Very nice.
Give me four with vinegar.

135
00:10:28,974 --> 00:10:30,675
It's my 18th voyage.

136
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:33,277
Returned from all of them
without a scratch on me.

137
00:10:39,952 --> 00:10:41,385
Can't do it.

138
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,422
<i>Please,</i>
<i>I've three children.

139
00:10:44,456 --> 00:10:46,157
<i>Without me...

140
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:47,692
Here, take it.
You have to.

141
00:10:47,726 --> 00:10:49,493
I've three children.

142
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:50,761
What will they do?
Come on.

143
00:10:50,796 --> 00:10:52,530
They've nothing
without me.

144
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:54,098
<i>Please, you have to!

145
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:56,567
Please, you don't
understand!

146
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:58,235
<i>Please!

147
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:06,243
<i>The man is a gambler.

148
00:11:07,746 --> 00:11:09,413
He wages that
a sailor's ship

149
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:12,683
will make it
to its destination.

150
00:11:12,718 --> 00:11:15,119
It is a strange wager
for the captain.

151
00:11:15,153 --> 00:11:17,788
He only wins
if he loses his life.

152
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:22,927
So why would a captain make the wager
in the first place?

153
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:27,431
A girl tells a man
that she has seen.

154
00:11:30,035 --> 00:11:32,169
If the captain dies,

155
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:34,472
the thin man pays
his family a lot of money.

156
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,844
But perhaps the gambler
loses his bet

157
00:11:39,878 --> 00:11:42,113
and decides he does not
have to pay after all.

158
00:11:42,147 --> 00:11:44,482
A destitute woman
and her small child,

159
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:48,319
what can they do to such a man
if he keeps their money for himself?

160
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:52,957
To whom can they turn
for recourse?

161
00:11:52,991 --> 00:11:55,292


162
00:11:58,997 --> 00:12:00,564
The Many-Faced God.

163
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:05,002
You said you didn't know
what I would see at the docks.

164
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:08,072
A man had no idea what a girl would see
and what she would not.

165
00:12:10,142 --> 00:12:12,910
A girl named Lanna
will return to the docks.

166
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:14,678
She will watch
the gambler.

167
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:17,815
<i>She will come to know as much about</i>
<i>him as she knows about herself.

168
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:20,384
And then what?

169
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:24,121
A gift for the thin man.

170
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:46,177
She's not ready.

171
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:49,280
Perhaps she is,
perhaps she's not.

172
00:12:49,314 --> 00:12:51,615
And if she's not?

173
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,552
It is all the same
to the Many-Faced God.

174
00:13:03,462 --> 00:13:05,429


175
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:15,172


176
00:13:17,576 --> 00:13:19,944
The trial
will take place soon.

177
00:13:19,978 --> 00:13:21,979
<i>The High Sparrow</i>
<i>will be presenting

178
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:23,814
<i>a substantial case</i>
<i>against you.

179
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:25,082
The charges?

180
00:13:25,117 --> 00:13:27,485
<i>Fornication,</i>
<i>treason, incest,

181
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:28,919
the murder
of King Robert.

182
00:13:28,954 --> 00:13:30,254
All lies.

183
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:32,022
Of course,
Your Grace.

184
00:13:36,595 --> 00:13:40,464
My concern is that
the Faith does not adhere

185
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:43,934
to the same standards
of proof as the crown.

186
00:13:43,969 --> 00:13:45,803
<i>I hope you'll excuse me</i>
<i>for saying it,

187
00:13:45,837 --> 00:13:48,472
<i>but belief is so often</i>
<i>the death of reason.

188
00:13:48,507 --> 00:13:50,441
I wish you had
said it sooner.

189
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:54,578
Is there any word
from Jaime?

190
00:13:54,613 --> 00:13:57,148
No, I'm afraid not.

191
00:14:03,488 --> 00:14:07,625
Your Grace,
Grand Maester Pycelle

192
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:09,827
has summoned
your Uncle Kevan

193
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:11,395
back from Casterly Rock

194
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:12,897
to serve
as Hand of the King.

195
00:14:12,931 --> 00:14:15,599
He now presides
over the small council.

196
00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:19,236
Tell him I need
to speak to him.

197
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:21,705
I implored him to visit you,
but he would not.

198
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:29,280
What about my son,
the king?

199
00:14:29,314 --> 00:14:31,115
If you can visit me,
then surely the king...

200
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:33,684
Your arrest
and Queen Margaery's arrest,

201
00:14:33,718 --> 00:14:35,085
the king has not
taken them well.

202
00:14:35,153 --> 00:14:37,021
<i>He remains</i>
<i>in his chambers.

203
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:40,991
His servants often find
his food in the hall left untouched.

204
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:42,526
You need to talk to him.

205
00:14:42,561 --> 00:14:44,828
You need to talk to my son and tell him
to come and see me,

206
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:46,230
come and see his mother.

207
00:14:46,264 --> 00:14:48,966
He... I tried,
Your Grace.

208
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,268
He wouldn't see me.
He won't see anyone.

209
00:14:52,637 --> 00:14:54,371
I can't stay here.

210
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:58,709
There is a way,
Your Grace.

211
00:15:02,681 --> 00:15:04,048
A way out.

212
00:15:06,618 --> 00:15:08,485
Confess?

213
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:11,121
To the High Sparrow?

214
00:15:11,156 --> 00:15:13,290
I won't.

215
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:16,193
I made him.

216
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:18,162
I rose him up
from nothing.

217
00:15:18,196 --> 00:15:20,998
I will not kneel before
some barefooted commoner

218
00:15:21,032 --> 00:15:23,500
and beg his forgiveness.

219
00:15:30,475 --> 00:15:33,077
Good-bye, my queen.

220
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:36,513
The work continues.

221
00:16:11,716 --> 00:16:13,751
Why?

222
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,887
Why, Theon?

223
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:20,057
I'm not Theon.
There is no Theon.

224
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:21,592
Reek.
Reek.

225
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:24,061
Why did you
tell him, Reek?

226
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,364
I was helping you.

227
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,932
You wanted to escape.

228
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:31,869
There is no escape.

229
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:34,438
Not ever.

230
00:16:34,472 --> 00:16:37,808
Theon Greyjoy
tried to escape.

231
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:39,677
The master knew.

232
00:16:40,612 --> 00:16:43,314
He knows everything.

233
00:16:43,348 --> 00:16:45,683
He hunted him
and caught him

234
00:16:45,717 --> 00:16:48,018
and strapped him
to a cross

235
00:16:48,053 --> 00:16:50,454
and cut away
piece after piece

236
00:16:50,488 --> 00:16:52,890
until there
was no Theon left.

237
00:16:56,628 --> 00:16:58,629
Good.

238
00:17:01,566 --> 00:17:05,736
If it weren't for you,
I'd still have a family.

239
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,205
If I could do
what Ramsay did to you

240
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:11,108
right here,
right now, I would.

241
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,214
I deserved everything.

242
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:21,585
I deserve to be Reek.

243
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:25,055
!
<i>I did terrible things.

244
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:29,560
Turned on Robb.

245
00:17:29,594 --> 00:17:32,096
Captured Winterfell.

246
00:17:32,163 --> 00:17:34,665
Killed those boys.
They weren't "those boys."

247
00:17:34,699 --> 00:17:37,034
They were Bran and Rickon.
They were your brothers.

248
00:17:37,068 --> 00:17:38,669
You've known them
since they were born.

249
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:40,270
They weren't.
They were only...

250
00:17:40,305 --> 00:17:42,005
Only what?

251
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,841
I can't.
Tell me.

252
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,342
I can't, not unless
the master says.

253
00:17:45,377 --> 00:17:46,744
Tell me. They weren't what?
They weren't...

254
00:17:46,778 --> 00:17:49,613
Tell me why Bran
and Rickon should be gone

255
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:51,281
while you still
breathe the air.

256
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:52,549
Tell me
to my face, Theon.

257
00:17:52,584 --> 00:17:54,418
Tell me that they
weren't your brothers!

258
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:55,986
They weren't
Bran and Rickon!

259
00:17:57,989 --> 00:18:00,424
I couldn't find them.

260
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:08,732
It was two farm boys.

261
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:15,839
I killed them and burned them
so no one would know.

262
00:18:20,712 --> 00:18:23,313
You didn't?

263
00:18:23,348 --> 00:18:25,582
Do you know where they went,
Bran and Rickon?

264
00:18:25,617 --> 00:18:27,217
I can't talk
to you anymore.

265
00:18:27,252 --> 00:18:28,986
Theon, you have to tell me.
Do you have any idea where...

266
00:18:29,053 --> 00:18:31,488
Not Theon! Reek!

267
00:18:33,258 --> 00:18:35,125


268
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:39,797
Our scouts tell us
he's got no more than 6,000 men.

269
00:18:39,831 --> 00:18:42,299
More than half of those
are mounted, however.

270
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,302
And how high do
Stannis's horses jump?

271
00:18:45,336 --> 00:18:47,704
Our walls have been
fully repaired.

272
00:18:47,739 --> 00:18:49,706
The gates have been
reinforced.

273
00:18:49,741 --> 00:18:52,810
We have enough food
for six months.

274
00:18:52,844 --> 00:18:56,647
We are more prepared
for a siege than they could ever be.

275
00:18:56,681 --> 00:18:59,283
All we have to do
is wait for them to freeze,

276
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:02,152
starve, and mutiny.

277
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,356
You disagree?

278
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:08,725
Stannis isn't
from the North.

279
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,794
You are, Father.

280
00:19:10,829 --> 00:19:14,064
I think you're missing an opportunity
to show the people of the North

281
00:19:14,098 --> 00:19:16,767
<i>how House Bolton</i>
<i>treats southern invaders.

282
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:18,068
And what
do you recommend?

283
00:19:18,102 --> 00:19:19,403
<i>That we not sit</i>
<i>and wait for Stannis

284
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:21,972
<i>to decide what sort of fight</i>
<i>this is going to be.

285
00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:24,074
That we hit first
and hit hard

286
00:19:24,108 --> 00:19:26,477
and leave a feast
for the crows.

287
00:19:26,511 --> 00:19:29,513
A smart commander does not
abandon a defensive advantage.

288
00:19:29,547 --> 00:19:31,915
<i>As long as we stay</i>
<i>behind these walls,

289
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,250
<i>they can't touch us.

290
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:35,185
Not to mention
that the snow is so deep,

291
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,954
we couldn't get
an army through to engage them

292
00:19:36,988 --> 00:19:38,288
even if we wanted to.

293
00:19:38,323 --> 00:19:40,591
I don't need an army.

294
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,126
I need 20 good men.

295
00:19:50,969 --> 00:19:52,703
So, have you
decided yet?

296
00:19:52,737 --> 00:19:55,205
Whether I'm worthy
of your service?

297
00:19:57,242 --> 00:20:00,744
Have you decided yet
whether you're going to have me killed?

298
00:20:00,778 --> 00:20:02,980
It's probably
my safest option.

299
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,051
I can see why
you would think so.

300
00:20:08,086 --> 00:20:10,287
It's what your father
would have done.

301
00:20:11,556 --> 00:20:12,996
And what would
your father have done?

302
00:20:15,093 --> 00:20:16,660
My father,

303
00:20:16,694 --> 00:20:19,663
who publically
sentenced me to death?

304
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:22,232
I'd say his thoughts on having me killed
were abundantly clear.

305
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:23,834
Is that why
you killed him?

306
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:30,474
Someday if you decide
not to execute me,

307
00:20:30,508 --> 00:20:32,676
I'll tell you all about
why I killed my father.

308
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,946
And on that day,
should it ever come,

309
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,282
we'll need
more wine than this.

310
00:20:40,618 --> 00:20:43,020
I know
what my father was.

311
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:45,589
<i>What he did.

312
00:20:45,657 --> 00:20:47,958
I know the Mad King
earned his name.

313
00:20:50,728 --> 00:20:53,764
So, here we sit.

314
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:56,800
Two terrible children
of two terrible fathers.

315
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:58,535
I'm terrible?

316
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,704
I've heard stories.

317
00:21:00,738 --> 00:21:04,074
Why did you travel to the far side
of the world to meet someone terrible?

318
00:21:04,075 --> 00:21:06,199
To see if you were
the right kind of terrible.

319
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,840
Which kind is that?

320
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:09,947
The kind that prevents
your people from being even more so.

321
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,017
Well, I did reopen
the fighting pits.

322
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:16,853
Under my rule, murder will once again
become entertainment.

323
00:21:16,888 --> 00:21:18,622
Yes, that was wise.

324
00:21:18,656 --> 00:21:21,925
And you agreed to marry someone
you loathe for the greater good.

325
00:21:21,993 --> 00:21:24,828
Very impressive.

326
00:21:24,862 --> 00:21:27,397
<i>My own sister married someone</i>
<i>she loathed as well,

327
00:21:27,432 --> 00:21:29,967
though not by choice
and certainly not

328
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:31,935
for the greater good,
gods forbid.

329
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,704
She ended up
having him killed.

330
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,941
Perhaps it won't
come to that.

331
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,652
It's not impossible that Varys was right
about you after all.

332
00:21:48,686 --> 00:21:51,855
Varys?
King Robert's spymaster?

333
00:21:51,923 --> 00:21:55,425
Yes, he's the one
who convinced me to come find you.

334
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,060
He was my travelling
companion

335
00:21:57,095 --> 00:21:59,396
before Ser Jorah seized
that role for himself.

336
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:02,099
Jorah sent my secrets
to Varys.

337
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:06,480
For 20 years the Spider oversaw
the campaign to find and kill me.

338
00:22:06,481 --> 00:22:08,673
He did what he had
to do to survive.

339
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:11,842
He did a lot of other things as well,
things he didn't have to do.

340
00:22:11,876 --> 00:22:15,779
<i>I suspect he's the main reason</i>
<i>you weren't slaughtered in your crib.

341
00:22:15,813 --> 00:22:17,581
But you trust him?

342
00:22:17,615 --> 00:22:19,116
<i>Yes, oddly.

343
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,386
He may be the only person
in the world I trust.

344
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,287
Except my brother.

345
00:22:24,322 --> 00:22:27,357
The brother
who killed my father?

346
00:22:27,392 --> 00:22:28,458
That's the one.

347
00:22:28,526 --> 00:22:30,293
Perhaps I will have you
killed after all.

348
00:22:30,328 --> 00:22:32,529
Your queenly prerogative.

349
00:22:34,632 --> 00:22:37,167
I had given up on life

350
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:40,637
until Varys convinced me
you might be worth living for.

351
00:22:40,705 --> 00:22:43,106
If you chop off
my head, well,

352
00:22:43,141 --> 00:22:45,175
my final days
were interesting.

353
00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:53,316
I'm not
going to kill you.

354
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:58,121
No? Banish me?

355
00:22:58,156 --> 00:22:59,890
No.

356
00:22:59,924 --> 00:23:01,591
So if I'm not going
to be murdered

357
00:23:01,626 --> 00:23:03,026
and I'm not going
to be banished...

358
00:23:03,061 --> 00:23:04,494
You're going
to advise me.

359
00:23:06,264 --> 00:23:08,632
While you can still speak
in complete sentences.

360
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,904
Advise you on what?

361
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:15,505
How to get
what I want.

362
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,075
The Iron Throne.

363
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:21,078
Perhaps you should try
wanting something else.

364
00:23:21,112 --> 00:23:23,580
If I want jokes,
I'll get myself a proper fool.

365
00:23:23,614 --> 00:23:25,916
<i>I'm not entirely joking.

366
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,418
<i>There's more to the world</i>
<i>than Westeros after all.

367
00:23:28,453 --> 00:23:32,789
How many hundreds of thousands of lives
have you changed for the better here?

368
00:23:32,824 --> 00:23:34,725
Perhaps this
is where you belong,

369
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:36,760
where you can do
the most good.

370
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,665
I fought so that no child
born into Slaver's Bay

371
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:44,801
would ever know
what it meant to be bought or sold.

372
00:23:44,836 --> 00:23:48,371
<i>I will continue</i>
<i>that fight here and beyond.

373
00:23:48,406 --> 00:23:49,973
But this is not my home.

374
00:23:50,007 --> 00:23:52,743
When you get back to your home,
who supports you?

375
00:23:52,777 --> 00:23:54,311
The common people.

376
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:56,947
Let's be generous
and assume that's going to happen.

377
00:23:56,981 --> 00:23:59,649
Here in Slaver's Bay,
you had the support of the common people

378
00:23:59,684 --> 00:24:02,119
and only
the common people.

379
00:24:02,153 --> 00:24:06,022
What was that like?
Ruling without the rich?

380
00:24:06,057 --> 00:24:08,525
House Targaryen is gone.

381
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,294
Not a single person who shares
your blood is alive to support you.

382
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:13,330
<i>The Starks</i>
<i>are gone as well.

383
00:24:13,364 --> 00:24:15,265
<i>Our two terrible fathers</i>
<i>saw to that.

384
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:16,900
<i>The remaining members</i>
<i>of House Lannister

385
00:24:16,968 --> 00:24:18,969
<i>will never back you,</i>
<i>not ever.

386
00:24:19,003 --> 00:24:21,271
Stannis Baratheon
won't back you, either.

387
00:24:21,305 --> 00:24:24,775
His entire claim to the throne rests on
the illegitimacy of yours.

388
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:26,910
<i>That leaves the Tyrells.

389
00:24:26,944 --> 00:24:29,579
Not impossible,
not enough.

390
00:24:29,647 --> 00:24:33,717
Lannister, Targaryen,
Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell.

391
00:24:33,751 --> 00:24:35,919
They're all just spokes
on a wheel.

392
00:24:35,953 --> 00:24:38,255
This one's on top,
then that one's on top.

393
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:42,459
And on and on it spins, crushing
those on the ground.

394
00:24:42,493 --> 00:24:46,229
It's a beautiful dream,
stopping the wheel.

395
00:24:46,264 --> 00:24:48,932
You're not the first person
who's ever dreamt it.

396
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:51,902
I'm not going
to stop the wheel.

397
00:24:53,237 --> 00:24:55,672
I'm going to break
the wheel.

398
00:24:59,177 --> 00:25:00,944


399
00:25:09,754 --> 00:25:11,822


400
00:25:18,196 --> 00:25:22,566
You said whoever wins will fight
at the Great Pit in front of the queen.

401
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,534
I won.

402
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:25,424
You struck me.

403
00:25:25,448 --> 00:25:27,737
Have me flogged
if it makes you happy.

404
00:25:27,738 --> 00:25:30,907
But I'm the best
you've got.

405
00:25:30,942 --> 00:25:33,743
If I win
at the Great Pit,

406
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:35,679
how much can you
sell me for?

407
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:40,083
You're a free man.

408
00:25:40,151 --> 00:25:42,352
You could have
gone anywhere.

409
00:25:42,386 --> 00:25:44,054
Why did you come back?

410
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,894
Let me fight for her

411
00:25:50,928 --> 00:25:52,963
and I belong to you.

412
00:25:58,202 --> 00:26:01,037
<i>Thirsty?

413
00:26:01,105 --> 00:26:02,973
Confess.

414
00:26:06,544 --> 00:26:09,779
I'll get out of here,
you realize, before long.

415
00:26:09,814 --> 00:26:11,014
Confess.

416
00:26:11,048 --> 00:26:14,317
I can make you
a wealthy woman.

417
00:26:14,352 --> 00:26:16,019
A lady of the court.

418
00:26:16,053 --> 00:26:17,554
Confess.

419
00:26:22,193 --> 00:26:25,862
Or I can make sure you die in the most
hideous way imaginable.

420
00:26:25,897 --> 00:26:28,164
And all I do is sit here

421
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:31,034
imagining hideous ways
for you to die.

422
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:43,546


423
00:26:43,581 --> 00:26:46,683


424
00:26:56,294 --> 00:26:58,561


425
00:27:07,104 --> 00:27:10,006


426
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,315
Does it hurt?

427
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,785
No.

428
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:24,020
Good.

429
00:27:27,258 --> 00:27:29,326
How are you?

430
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,996
I'm not the one who got punched
and kicked in the face.

431
00:27:34,932 --> 00:27:36,866
You know what I mean.

432
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:40,003
I'm good.

433
00:27:41,172 --> 00:27:43,606
Are you scared?
A little.

434
00:27:43,641 --> 00:27:45,608
Me, too.

435
00:27:47,478 --> 00:27:49,312


436
00:27:49,347 --> 00:27:51,047
Who's there?
<i>Olly.

437
00:27:51,082 --> 00:27:53,083
Oh.

438
00:27:53,117 --> 00:27:54,985
Come in.

439
00:27:57,488 --> 00:27:59,456
I heard what happened.

440
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,225
Oh, not to worry.

441
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:05,462
Men brawl from time to time.
It's only natural.

442
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:09,632
Figured you were hungry.

443
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:13,236
Oh, you're a good lad.

444
00:28:15,072 --> 00:28:17,407
Wanted to ask you
something

445
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:19,275
if you've got the time.

446
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,611
I need to check
on baby Sam.

447
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:28,752


448
00:28:28,786 --> 00:28:31,988
<i>Now then,</i>
<i>how can I help?

449
00:28:33,457 --> 00:28:35,392
It's about the Lord Commander.
Yes?

450
00:28:35,426 --> 00:28:38,495
He's going up to Hardhome
to save all them wildlings.

451
00:28:40,431 --> 00:28:43,700
Wildlings killed
my mom and dad.

452
00:28:43,734 --> 00:28:45,435
They killed everyone
in my village.

453
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:47,203
We've been
fighting them for years.

454
00:28:47,271 --> 00:28:48,872
<i>This wasn't a fight.

455
00:28:48,906 --> 00:28:52,409
We were farmers
and they slaughtered us.

456
00:28:54,011 --> 00:28:55,745
So why is he saving them?

457
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,561
Wildlings are people.

458
00:28:58,595 --> 00:29:01,931
Just like us, there are good ones
and bad ones.

459
00:29:01,965 --> 00:29:05,334
The one he's travelling with,
the one with the red beard,

460
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,336
he led the raid
on my village.

461
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,672
<i>Oh, Olly.</i>
How can he trust him?

462
00:29:11,108 --> 00:29:13,776
I've seen the army
of the dead.

463
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,812
<i>I've seen</i>
<i>the white walkers.

464
00:29:16,847 --> 00:29:19,582
And they're coming for us,
for all the living.

465
00:29:21,852 --> 00:29:25,021
And when it's time,

466
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:28,057
we'll need every
last man we can find.

467
00:29:28,091 --> 00:29:31,060
But what if we let
the wildlings through the gates

468
00:29:31,161 --> 00:29:32,962
and they cut our throats
while we sleep?

469
00:29:32,996 --> 00:29:35,364
Jon's taking a risk,
but he has to.

470
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:38,100
We don't stand
a chance otherwise.

471
00:29:38,135 --> 00:29:42,071
<i>Sometimes a man</i>
<i>has to make hard choices,

472
00:29:42,105 --> 00:29:44,006
<i>choices that might look</i>
<i>wrong to others,

473
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:46,809
<i>but you know are right</i>
<i>in the long run.

474
00:29:46,843 --> 00:29:48,544
You believe that?

475
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,713
With all my heart.

476
00:29:57,287 --> 00:29:59,555
<i>Try not to worry, Olly.

477
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,558
I've been worrying
about Jon for years.

478
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,560
He always comes back.

479
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:11,567


480
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,088


481
00:30:46,837 --> 00:30:48,838
<i>Turn us about!

482
00:31:21,438 --> 00:31:24,039
You trust me,
Jon Snow?

483
00:31:24,074 --> 00:31:26,242
Does that
make me a fool?

484
00:31:26,276 --> 00:31:28,544
We're fools
together now.

485
00:31:35,485 --> 00:31:37,653


486
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,930
Lord of Bones.

487
00:31:47,998 --> 00:31:50,399
Been a long time.

488
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:53,302
Last time I saw you,
the little crow was your prisoner.

489
00:31:53,336 --> 00:31:55,704
The other way around now.
What happened?

490
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:57,339
War.

491
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:00,276
War?
You call that a war?

492
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,478
The greatest army
the North has ever seen

493
00:32:02,512 --> 00:32:05,514
cut to pieces
by some southern king.

494
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,683
We should gather
the elders,

495
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,618
find somewhere
quiet to talk.

496
00:32:09,686 --> 00:32:11,554
You don't give
the orders here.

497
00:32:11,588 --> 00:32:13,622
I'm not giving an order.

498
00:32:15,325 --> 00:32:17,159
Why aren't you
in chains?

499
00:32:18,128 --> 00:32:20,563
He's not my prisoner.

500
00:32:20,597 --> 00:32:21,831
No?

501
00:32:21,865 --> 00:32:23,699
What is he?

502
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,434
We're allies.

503
00:32:27,003 --> 00:32:29,705
You fucking traitor.

504
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:34,510
You fight
for the crows now?

505
00:32:36,613 --> 00:32:39,148
I don't fight
for the crows.

506
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:44,053
We're not here to fight.
We're here to talk.

507
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,488
Is that right?

508
00:32:46,523 --> 00:32:49,892
You and the pretty crow
do a lot of talking, Tormund?

509
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,061
And when
you're done talking,

510
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,730
do you get down on your knees
and suck his cock?

511
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,365


512
00:33:10,413 --> 00:33:13,515
Gather the elders
and let's talk.

513
00:33:37,741 --> 00:33:39,375


514
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:41,777
My name's Jon Snow.

515
00:33:43,346 --> 00:33:45,614
I'm Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

516
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:50,686
We're not friends.

517
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,206
<i>We've never been friends.

518
00:33:54,211 --> 00:33:55,864
<i>We won't become</i>
<i>friends today.

519
00:33:58,061 --> 00:34:00,162
<i>This isn't</i>
<i>about friendship.

520
00:34:02,032 --> 00:34:04,199
This is about
survival.

521
00:34:04,234 --> 00:34:06,268
This is about putting
a 700-foot wall

522
00:34:06,303 --> 00:34:08,871
between you
and what's out there.

523
00:34:08,905 --> 00:34:10,606
You built that wall
to keep us out.

524
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,609
Since when do the crows
give two shits if we live?

525
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:16,512
<i>In normal times we wouldn't.</i>
<i>But these aren't normal times.

526
00:34:16,546 --> 00:34:19,949
The white walkers
don't care if a man's free folk or crow.

527
00:34:19,983 --> 00:34:23,118
We're all the same to them,
meat for their army.

528
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,321
But together
we can beat them.

529
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:27,489
Beat the white walkers?

530
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:30,392
Good luck with that.
Run from them, maybe.

531
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,304
It's not a trick.

532
00:34:45,075 --> 00:34:48,143
It's a gift
for those who join us.

533
00:34:53,016 --> 00:34:55,985
Dragonglass.

534
00:34:56,019 --> 00:34:59,021
A man of the Night's Watch
used one of these daggers

535
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,123
<i>to kill a walker.

536
00:35:01,157 --> 00:35:03,592
You saw this?
No.

537
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,194
But I trust the man.

538
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,763
There are old stories
about dragonglass.

539
00:35:07,797 --> 00:35:11,266
There are old stories
about ice spiders as big as hounds.

540
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:13,469
And with the things
we've seen, you don't believe them?

541
00:35:13,503 --> 00:35:16,305
<i>Come with me and I'll share</i>
<i>these weapons.

542
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:17,873
Come with you where?

543
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,675
<i>There are good lands</i>
<i>south of the Wall.

544
00:35:19,709 --> 00:35:21,477
<i>The Night's Watch will let you</i>
<i>through the tunnel

545
00:35:21,511 --> 00:35:23,912
and allow your people
to farm those lands.

546
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:26,982


547
00:35:27,017 --> 00:35:29,184
I knew Mance Rayder.

548
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,387
<i>He never wanted a war</i>
<i>with the Night's Watch.

549
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:33,922
<i>He wanted a new life</i>
<i>for his people, for you.

550
00:35:33,957 --> 00:35:36,392
We're prepared
to give you that new life.

551
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,060
If?

552
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:41,397
If you swear you'll join us
when the real war begins.

553
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:45,401
Where is Mance?

554
00:35:48,738 --> 00:35:51,507
He died.
How?

555
00:35:56,746 --> 00:35:58,747
I put an arrow
through his heart.

556
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:01,016
Hey, hey.

557
00:36:01,084 --> 00:36:03,118
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

558
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,688
Hey, hey, hey.

559
00:36:06,723 --> 00:36:08,357
<i>I say we send</i>
<i>the Lord Commander

560
00:36:08,391 --> 00:36:12,194
back to Castle Black
with no eyes.

561
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,131
Hey, none of you
saw Mance die.

562
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:17,866
I did.

563
00:36:17,901 --> 00:36:21,303
The southern king
who broke our army, Stannis,

564
00:36:21,337 --> 00:36:23,972
wanted to burn him alive
to send us a message.

565
00:36:24,007 --> 00:36:26,975
Jon Snow defied
that cunt's orders.

566
00:36:28,211 --> 00:36:30,379
His arrow was mercy.

567
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:32,781
What he did
took courage.

568
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,516
And that's
what we need today,

569
00:36:34,551 --> 00:36:36,185
the courage
to make peace

570
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:39,455
with men we've been killing
for generations.

571
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,690
I lost my father,
my uncle,

572
00:36:41,724 --> 00:36:44,093
and two brothers
fighting the damn crows.

573
00:36:44,127 --> 00:36:47,229
I'm not asking you
to forget your dead.

574
00:36:47,263 --> 00:36:49,364
I'll never
forget mine.

575
00:36:51,201 --> 00:36:55,471
I lost 50 brothers
the night that Mance attacked the Wall.

576
00:36:56,439 --> 00:36:58,740
But I'm asking you

577
00:36:58,775 --> 00:37:00,843
to think about
your children now.

578
00:37:02,712 --> 00:37:04,346
<i>They'll never have</i>
<i>children of their own

579
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,815
<i>if we don't band together.

580
00:37:06,883 --> 00:37:09,685
The Long Night
is coming

581
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,687
and the dead
come with it.

582
00:37:11,721 --> 00:37:14,423
No clan can stop them.

583
00:37:14,457 --> 00:37:16,291
The free folk
can't stop them.

584
00:37:16,326 --> 00:37:17,726
The Night's Watch
can't stop them.

585
00:37:17,794 --> 00:37:21,196
And all the southern kings
can't stop them.

586
00:37:22,332 --> 00:37:24,933
<i>Only together,</i>
<i>all of us.

587
00:37:24,968 --> 00:37:26,702
And even then
it may not be enough,

588
00:37:26,736 --> 00:37:29,004
but at least we'll give
the fuckers a fight.

589
00:37:44,521 --> 00:37:47,089
You vouch
for this man, Tormund?

590
00:37:49,659 --> 00:37:52,661
He's prettier
than both my daughters,

591
00:37:52,695 --> 00:37:54,563
<i>but he knows</i>
<i>how to fight.

592
00:37:54,597 --> 00:37:57,466
He's young,
but he knows how to lead.

593
00:37:58,968 --> 00:38:00,636
He didn't have
to come to Hardhome.

594
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:04,806
He came because
he needs us

595
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:06,875
and we need him.

596
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,781
My ancestors
would spit on me

597
00:38:12,815 --> 00:38:14,950
if I broke bread
with a crow.

598
00:38:14,984 --> 00:38:17,853
So would mine,
but fuck 'em, they're dead.

599
00:38:24,627 --> 00:38:27,196


600
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,531
I'll never trust
a man in black.

601
00:38:33,636 --> 00:38:36,138
But I trust you,
Tormund.

602
00:38:36,172 --> 00:38:39,508
If you say
this is the way,

603
00:38:39,542 --> 00:38:40,809
we're with you.

604
00:38:44,881 --> 00:38:47,482
This is the way.

605
00:38:48,518 --> 00:38:50,319
<i>I'm with Tormund.

606
00:38:50,353 --> 00:38:52,688
We stay here,
we're dead men.

607
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:57,392
At least with King Crow,
there's a chance.

608
00:38:57,427 --> 00:39:00,028


609
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:03,232
Tormund.

610
00:39:06,269 --> 00:39:09,071
Keep that new life
you want to give us.

611
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:14,409
And keep your glass,
King Crow.

612
00:39:16,512 --> 00:39:20,249
As soon as you get on
his ships, they're gonna slit your throats

613
00:39:20,283 --> 00:39:23,252
and dump your bodies
to the bottom of the Shivering Sea.

614
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:27,256
That's our enemy.

615
00:39:28,891 --> 00:39:31,026
That has always
been our enemy.

616
00:39:46,909 --> 00:39:48,710
I fucking hate Thenns.

617
00:39:56,953 --> 00:39:59,388


618
00:40:08,665 --> 00:40:11,199
Move it.
Be careful.

619
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:13,101
<i>Move 'em along, now.
Cast-off time.

620
00:40:13,136 --> 00:40:15,103
<i>That's it, come on.

621
00:40:17,807 --> 00:40:20,275
How many are with us?
5,000?

622
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,477
I'm not good
at counting.

623
00:40:23,813 --> 00:40:25,514
We're leaving
too many behind.

624
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,049
The free folk
are stubborn.

625
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:29,584
You know how long
it took Mance to band them together?

626
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:32,120
20 fucking years.

627
00:40:32,188 --> 00:40:35,190
And he knew them better
than I ever will.

628
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:39,494
They're running out of food
and there's nothing to hunt.

629
00:40:39,529 --> 00:40:41,029
They'll come around.

630
00:40:43,866 --> 00:40:46,368
<i>Get yourselves ready.
Aye!

631
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,170
Johnna is gonna
look after you.

632
00:40:48,204 --> 00:40:50,972
She's in charge.
You listen to her.

633
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,676
<i>Take her.</i>
<i>There you are.

634
00:40:54,711 --> 00:40:56,044
I want to go with you.

635
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,714
I need to get
the old folks on the boats.

636
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,982
I'm right behind you.
I promise.

637
00:41:04,887 --> 00:41:06,521
Go on.

638
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,125
<i>Another one.

639
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:13,061
<i>Keep moving.</i>
<i>We'll meet you out there.

640
00:41:15,732 --> 00:41:18,367
<i>Won't be able to take that on the boat.</i>
<i>It's too big.

641
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:21,903
<i>That's the last one!</i>
<i>Three more! Move on!

642
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:25,507
<i>There's more dragonglass everywhere.

643
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:28,610


644
00:41:31,748 --> 00:41:34,516
<i>I've got some more daggers</i>
<i>over here.

645
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,985
<i>Put that dagger</i>
<i>in his bag.

646
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:41,590
Uh...

647
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,025


648
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,133


649
00:41:58,408 --> 00:42:00,542


650
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,947


651
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,287


652
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:23,031


653
00:42:33,242 --> 00:42:37,078
<i>Steady!

654
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:42,083


655
00:42:54,831 --> 00:42:56,865
Shut the gates.

656
00:42:56,933 --> 00:42:58,700
<i>Close the gates!

657
00:42:58,734 --> 00:43:01,436


658
00:43:02,972 --> 00:43:04,806
Shut the gates!

659
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:10,345
Wait!

660
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:13,114
Open the gate!
Let us in!

661
00:43:14,183 --> 00:43:16,318
Help us!

662
00:43:26,028 --> 00:43:28,363
<i>Please open it!

663
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,932
<i>Open the gate!

664
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,668


665
00:43:35,338 --> 00:43:37,372


666
00:43:57,493 --> 00:43:58,894


667
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:02,898


668
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,939


669
00:44:11,007 --> 00:44:13,441


670
00:44:13,476 --> 00:44:16,411


671
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,647
<i>Ready your arrows!

672
00:44:19,815 --> 00:44:21,850


673
00:44:27,323 --> 00:44:30,258


674
00:44:33,429 --> 00:44:36,031


675
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,069
Wait! Wait!
Keep in line! Keep in line!

676
00:44:41,103 --> 00:44:43,438
Get in line!

677
00:44:51,514 --> 00:44:53,248


678
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:08,697


679
00:45:15,571 --> 00:45:17,472


680
00:45:20,376 --> 00:45:22,143


681
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:46,167
Get to the front!

682
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,136
<i>Go on, shoot it!

683
00:45:50,272 --> 00:45:52,507


684
00:45:54,677 --> 00:45:58,813
Wait, wait!
<i>Duncan, hold the line! Hold the line!

685
00:46:03,285 --> 00:46:05,320
Lord Commander!

686
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:07,689
Get them to the ship
and come back for me!

687
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,357
But you'll never make..
Now!

688
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:12,360


689
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:15,397
Let me on!
Let me on!

690
00:46:15,464 --> 00:46:17,599
Bloody fucking move!
Let go!

691
00:46:18,801 --> 00:46:20,301
You should be on
one of those boats.

692
00:46:20,336 --> 00:46:23,038
So should you.
My little girls got on.

693
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:25,240
They're gonna let them
pass the Wall even if you're not there?

694
00:46:25,307 --> 00:46:27,909
You have my word.
I've given orders.

695
00:46:27,943 --> 00:46:30,645
Don't think you're gonna
be there to enforce those orders.

696
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,814


697
00:46:32,848 --> 00:46:35,283
If they get through,
everyone dies.

698
00:46:38,888 --> 00:46:41,790
Night's Watch, with me!

699
00:46:41,824 --> 00:46:45,126
Move! Move!

700
00:46:45,161 --> 00:46:46,961
Move!

701
00:47:32,742 --> 00:47:35,009


702
00:47:36,345 --> 00:47:39,748


703
00:47:52,128 --> 00:47:53,228
No, no!

704
00:48:03,105 --> 00:48:05,874
<i>Tormund, the sleigh!
</i>Okay, okay!

705
00:48:54,123 --> 00:48:55,523
The dragonglass.

706
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:57,659
You and me, then!

707
00:48:58,694 --> 00:49:00,295
Go!

708
00:49:13,976 --> 00:49:16,077


709
00:50:10,332 --> 00:50:12,333
Get the glass.

710
00:50:16,872 --> 00:50:18,506


711
00:50:25,281 --> 00:50:27,215


712
