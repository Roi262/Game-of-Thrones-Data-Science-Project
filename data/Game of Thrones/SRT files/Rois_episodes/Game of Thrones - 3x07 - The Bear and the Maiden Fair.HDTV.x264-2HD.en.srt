37
00:03:37,352 --> 00:03:39,019
How far are we?

38
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:41,221
About a week, I think.

39
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,790
You think?
You don't know?

40
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:47,493
When we went to Castle
Black, we took the kingsroad.

41
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,228
You and your roads.

42
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,730
Is that how you lot
do your fighting?

43
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:56,166
You march down the road banging
drums and waving banners?

44
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:57,834
Most of the time, yes.

45
00:03:57,869 --> 00:04:01,538
How do the men holding
the banners fight?

46
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:03,540
They don't, really.

47
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:07,611
It's a great honor
to carry your house sigil.

48
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:10,714
And the drummers-- is
that a great honor, too?

49
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:13,750
Usually it's the young boys
banging the drums.

50
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:15,419
So what good are they?

51
00:04:15,453 --> 00:04:18,856
- They help the men march.
- How?

52
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,460
Well, it's--
it's the rhythm.

53
00:04:22,494 --> 00:04:24,996
Oh, you mean right foot,
left foot,

54
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,031
right foot,
left foot, right foot?

55
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:30,235
You need help remembering that?

56
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:33,505
When Mance gives the signal
and we hit Castle Black,

57
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,009
we won't be banging on drums
to let them know we're coming.

58
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,111
No.

59
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,414
No, you're just gonna
light the biggest fire

60
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,884
the North has ever seen to
let them know you're coming.

61
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,520
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

62
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,424
She's right, you don't.

63
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:58,729
I know you cut me
loose on the Wall.

64
00:04:58,763 --> 00:05:00,497
Cut her loose, too.

65
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:02,565
Do you see her
sulking about it?

66
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:06,669
That's because she understands
the way things are.

67
00:05:08,372 --> 00:05:11,274
And are you gonna
share it with me?

68
00:05:11,308 --> 00:05:14,644
The deep wisdom you found
inside the head of a bird?

69
00:05:14,678 --> 00:05:17,046
People work together
when it suits them.

70
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,748
They're loyal
when it suits them.

71
00:05:18,782 --> 00:05:21,284
They love each other
when it suits them.

72
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:24,187
And they kill each other
when it suits them.

73
00:05:24,222 --> 00:05:26,357
She knows that, you don't.

74
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:29,794
Which is why you'll
never hold onto her.

75
00:05:45,243 --> 00:05:48,279
That rain will cost us
another day.

76
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:52,684
Frey will wait.
He knows we're coming.

77
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:54,886
Lord Walder is prickly
by nature.

78
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,288
Prickly?
That what you call it?

79
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:59,657
Might be the least
pleasant man I've ever met.

80
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:02,326
- Yes, and that is why--
- I've seen wet shits

81
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:05,529
<i>I liked better</i>
<i>than Walder Frey.</i>

82
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:10,066
Apologies, Your Grace.

83
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:13,169
Spent too many years around
lancers and pikemen.

84
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:16,005
I've spent the last two
years nursing wounded men,

85
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:18,207
watching them bleed and die.

86
00:06:18,241 --> 00:06:20,276
I'm not afraid of wet shits.

87
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,547
Lord Frey will take
this delay as a slight.

88
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:26,249
He can take it as he likes.

89
00:06:26,283 --> 00:06:28,385
He's getting
the wedding he wanted.

90
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:30,053
He's getting a wedding.

91
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:32,389
It was a king he wanted.

92
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:34,425
<i>Edmure is the best
match a Frey has had</i>

93
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:37,328
in the history of their house.

94
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:39,096
We should all get some sleep.

95
00:07:58,243 --> 00:07:59,777
If you don't put
some clothes on,

96
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:02,313
I can't promise
I won't attack you again.

97
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:04,548
Attack. Attack.

98
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,507
<i>Who are you writing?</i>

99
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,943
My mother.

100
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:35,514
- Is that Valyrian?
- Gaaa.

101
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,349
Gaaa?

102
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,292
Say hello for me.

103
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,661
<i>Rytsas.</i>

104
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,898
<i>"Ritsas."</i>

105
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,933
That was close enough.

106
00:08:56,771 --> 00:08:59,606
Does she know
her daughter's a queen?

107
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,742
Not yet.

108
00:09:03,345 --> 00:09:06,080
That will be
a surprise, I expect.

109
00:09:08,684 --> 00:09:10,718
Many surprises for her.

110
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,392
How am I supposed
to sit here planning a war

111
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:19,728
when you're over there
looking like that?

112
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,935
Will you come with me
one day to Volantis?

113
00:09:26,969 --> 00:09:29,538
<i>When all this is over?</i>

114
00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:31,807
I will.

115
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:34,210
I promise.

116
00:09:38,415 --> 00:09:41,918
<i>I know she'd love to meet you.</i>

117
00:09:42,853 --> 00:09:45,054
And her grandchild.

118
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:50,860
What, now?

119
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,934
Are you certain?

120
00:09:59,603 --> 00:10:02,105
Are you angry with me?

121
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:03,907
Angry?

122
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:09,312
You're my queen.

123
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:15,852
And I have your little prince
or princess inside me.

124
00:10:16,954 --> 00:10:19,389
Maybe one of each.

125
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:21,424
Don't get greedy.

126
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:33,669
Can you leave the war
for one night?

127
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,074
I love you.

128
00:10:39,243 --> 00:10:41,979
Do you hear me?

129
00:10:42,013 --> 00:10:44,515
I love you.

130
00:10:58,597 --> 00:11:01,599
Most men fuck like dogs.

131
00:11:03,802 --> 00:11:06,236
No grace, no skill.

132
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:08,305
A few dozen thrusts and done.

133
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:11,441
You need to be patient.
Give her time.

134
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:13,743
Your cock shouldn't go near her

135
00:11:13,777 --> 00:11:17,079
till she's slick
as a baby seal.

136
00:11:17,113 --> 00:11:19,848
And then you go inside,

137
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:21,517
<i>but slowly.</i>

138
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:24,987
Don't jam it in like
you're spearing a pig.

139
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:26,589
Come on!

140
00:11:26,623 --> 00:11:30,059
Hey, come on.

141
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:44,373
You think he
loves you, is that it?

142
00:11:44,408 --> 00:11:47,243
What did he tell you? He's
gonna make you his lady

143
00:11:47,277 --> 00:11:49,746
and live with you
in some castle?

144
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,415
No, he didn't tell me anything.

145
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,184
He barely talks.

146
00:11:54,218 --> 00:11:56,420
I've seen you two
whispering in the night,

147
00:11:56,454 --> 00:11:58,622
giggling like a pair of girls.

148
00:11:58,656 --> 00:12:00,523
What, you're jealous?

149
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:02,459
Of course I'm jealous.

150
00:12:02,493 --> 00:12:04,327
You should be
with one of your own.

151
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:06,162
And you're one of my own?

152
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:07,956
I've never heard
a kind word from your mouth.

153
00:12:07,965 --> 00:12:11,166
You would if you were mine.

154
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:15,870
I'd tell you
that you're beautiful

155
00:12:15,905 --> 00:12:19,241
and fierce and wild.

156
00:12:19,275 --> 00:12:21,409
I'd be good to you.

157
00:12:24,213 --> 00:12:26,347
You love him?

158
00:12:32,854 --> 00:12:35,522
'Cause he's pretty?
Is that it?

159
00:12:35,557 --> 00:12:38,659
You like his pretty hair
and his pretty eyes?

160
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:43,297
- You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
- Don't touch me.

161
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:46,534
You won't love him so much when
you find out what he really is.

162
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:53,674
Growing up at Winterfell, all
I ever wanted was to escape,

163
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:57,845
to come here to the capital.

164
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,514
See the southern knights
and their painted armor

165
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:04,018
and King's Landing
after dark--

166
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,556
all the candles burning
in all those windows.

167
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:12,726
I'm stupid.

168
00:13:13,595 --> 00:13:15,229
A stupid little girl

169
00:13:15,263 --> 00:13:18,232
with stupid dreams
who never learns.

170
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:20,200
Come on.

171
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,104
Come walk with me.

172
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,808
I remember the first time
I saw you in the throne room.

173
00:13:28,843 --> 00:13:32,111
I'd never seen anyone
who looked so unhappy.

174
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:34,580
I want very much for you
to be happy, Sansa,

175
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,749
and so does my grandmother.

176
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,787
You would have been
happy at Highgarden.

177
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,355
But women in our position

178
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,392
must make the best
of our circumstances.

179
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:49,429
How do I make the best
of my circumstances?

180
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:51,731
I have to marry him.

181
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:56,770
- Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
- No.

182
00:13:56,804 --> 00:13:59,306
Has he been kind to you?

183
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,608
He's tried.

184
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:03,109
You don't want him, though.

185
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:04,444
He's a Lannister.

186
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:07,080
Far from the worst
Lannister, wouldn't you say?

187
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,317
I'm sorry.

188
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:13,186
Here I am complaining to you...

189
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,789
My son will be king.

190
00:14:15,823 --> 00:14:17,291
Sons learn from their mothers.

191
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:20,226
I plan to teach mine
a great deal.

192
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:23,063
And your son,
if I'm not mistaken,

193
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:27,034
your son might be
the Lord of Casterly Rock

194
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:28,936
and the North someday.

195
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,240
What?

196
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,742
My son...

197
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:37,877
with him.

198
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,649
I'll have to--

199
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:44,618
we'll have to--

200
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:46,587
If it's the pain
you're worried about--

201
00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:48,822
I'm not afraid of the pain.

202
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:50,958
Not after what
Joffrey's done to me.

203
00:14:50,992 --> 00:14:52,593
What is it, then?

204
00:14:54,662 --> 00:14:57,131
He's rather good-looking
even with the scar.

205
00:14:57,165 --> 00:14:59,367
Especially with the scar.

206
00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:01,802
He's a dwarf.

207
00:15:01,837 --> 00:15:04,038
And Loras--

208
00:15:04,073 --> 00:15:05,840
Loras.

209
00:15:08,778 --> 00:15:11,079
Some women like tall men.

210
00:15:11,113 --> 00:15:12,748
Some like short men.

211
00:15:12,782 --> 00:15:15,551
Some like hairy men.
Some like bald men.

212
00:15:15,585 --> 00:15:18,787
Gentle men, rough men,
ugly men, pretty men,

213
00:15:18,822 --> 00:15:21,190
pretty girls.

214
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:24,293
Most women don't know what they
like until they've tried it.

215
00:15:24,327 --> 00:15:27,963
And, sadly, so many of us
get to try so little

216
00:15:27,997 --> 00:15:30,265
before we're old and gray.

217
00:15:31,734 --> 00:15:33,335
Tyrion may surprise you.

218
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:37,072
From what I've heard,
he's quite experienced.

219
00:15:37,106 --> 00:15:40,342
And that's a good thing?

220
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:41,777
<i>It can be.</i>

221
00:15:41,812 --> 00:15:43,579
We're very complicated,
you know.

222
00:15:43,614 --> 00:15:45,948
Pleasing us takes practice.

223
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:48,384
How do you know all this?

224
00:15:48,418 --> 00:15:50,819
Did your mother teach you?

225
00:15:54,057 --> 00:15:56,858
Yes, sweet girl.
My mother taught me.

226
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:02,365
<i>She's a child.</i>

227
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,933
<i>She's a foot
taller than you.</i>

228
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:05,768
A tall child.

229
00:16:05,802 --> 00:16:07,837
What's the youngest
you've ever had?

230
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:09,372
Not that young.

231
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:11,641
How much older?

232
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:13,410
Older.

233
00:16:13,444 --> 00:16:16,547
You're a lord, she's a lady.

234
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:18,415
And a beauty at that.

235
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:19,983
I don't see the problem.

236
00:16:20,018 --> 00:16:22,286
Shae isn't going to like it.

237
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,054
Shae is a whore.

238
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:26,691
Are you gonna
marry her? Eh?

239
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:29,794
How did marrying a whore work
out for you the first time?

240
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:32,764
I should never have
told you about that.

241
00:16:32,798 --> 00:16:36,167
You want Shae, keep her.
Wed one and bed the other.

242
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:39,371
All you have to do is get
a son in the Stark girl.

243
00:16:39,405 --> 00:16:41,273
He'll be Lord
of Winterfell one day.

244
00:16:41,307 --> 00:16:43,508
You can rule the North
in his name.

245
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:46,311
You'll have two women and a
whole kingdom of your own.

246
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:48,180
Two women to despise me

247
00:16:48,214 --> 00:16:50,515
and a whole kingdom
to join them.

248
00:16:52,018 --> 00:16:55,353
You waste time trying
to get people to love you,

249
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:58,156
you'll end up the most
popular dead man in town.

250
00:17:02,261 --> 00:17:04,263
You want to fuck
that Stark girl.

251
00:17:04,297 --> 00:17:06,898
<i>You just don't want</i>
<i>to admit it.</i>

252
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:10,836
I don't pay you to put
evil notions in my head.

253
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,706
The ones already there
don't need company.

254
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,308
You pay me to kill people
who bother you.

255
00:17:18,678 --> 00:17:21,213
Evil notions come free.

256
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:55,279
Your Grace.

257
00:17:55,313 --> 00:17:57,415
Grandfather.

258
00:17:57,449 --> 00:17:59,751
You wanted to speak to me?

259
00:17:59,785 --> 00:18:01,552
Yes.

260
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:05,590
I'd like a report on the
meetings of my small council.

261
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,693
You're welcome
to attend the meetings

262
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:09,929
of your small council,
Your Grace.

263
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,431
Any or all of them.

264
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,300
I've been very busy.

265
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:15,936
Many important matters
require a king's attention.

266
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,138
Of course.

267
00:18:19,273 --> 00:18:21,708
You've been holding
the council meetings

268
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:25,311
in the Tower of the Hand instead
of the small council chamber.

269
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:27,013
I have, yes.

270
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:30,050
May I ask why?

271
00:18:30,084 --> 00:18:33,086
The Tower of the Hand
is where I work.

272
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:36,289
To walk from there
to here would take time,

273
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,992
time I could otherwise
spend productively.

274
00:18:39,026 --> 00:18:41,394
So if I wanted to attend
a council meeting,

275
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:45,298
I would now have to climb all the
stairs in the Tower of the Hand?

276
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:03,617
We could arrange
to have you carried.

277
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:08,922
Tell me about
the Targaryen girl

278
00:19:08,957 --> 00:19:11,991
in the east and her dragons.

279
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,660
Where did you hear about this?

280
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,162
Is it true?

281
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,264
Apparently so.

282
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:24,536
Don't you think we ought
to do something about it?

283
00:19:25,638 --> 00:19:27,272
When I was Hand of the King

284
00:19:27,307 --> 00:19:29,541
under your father's
predecessor,

285
00:19:29,575 --> 00:19:32,177
the skulls of all
the Targaryen dragons

286
00:19:32,211 --> 00:19:34,645
were kept in this room.

287
00:19:36,114 --> 00:19:38,415
The skull of the last of them

288
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,484
was right here.

289
00:19:40,518 --> 00:19:43,954
It was the size of an apple.

290
00:19:45,156 --> 00:19:47,958
And the biggest
was the size of a carriage.

291
00:19:48,026 --> 00:19:50,761
Yes, and the creature
to whom it belonged

292
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:53,964
died 300 years ago.

293
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:56,600
Curiosities on the far
side of the world

294
00:19:56,635 --> 00:19:57,968
are no threat to us.

295
00:19:58,003 --> 00:20:01,405
But how do we know these
dragons are just curiosities

296
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,475
and not the beasts that brought
the whole world to heel?

297
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:07,478
Because we have been told
as much by the many experts

298
00:20:07,512 --> 00:20:09,647
who serve the realm
by counseling the king

299
00:20:09,681 --> 00:20:11,615
on matters about
which he knows nothing.

300
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,084
But I haven't been counseled.

301
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:17,788
You are being counseled
at this very moment.

302
00:20:19,491 --> 00:20:23,027
I should be consulted
about such things.

303
00:20:23,061 --> 00:20:24,562
From now on, I will see to it

304
00:20:24,596 --> 00:20:26,664
that you are
appropriately consulted

305
00:20:26,698 --> 00:20:28,966
on important matters

306
00:20:29,001 --> 00:20:31,102
whenever necessary.

307
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:38,609
Your Grace.

308
00:20:51,922 --> 00:20:53,656
Yunkai.

309
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,757
The Yellow City.

310
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:02,864
<i>The Yunkish train
bed slaves, not soldiers.</i>

311
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:04,933
We can defeat them.

312
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:07,402
On the field, with ease.

313
00:21:07,437 --> 00:21:09,171
But they won't
meet us on the field.

314
00:21:09,205 --> 00:21:12,374
They have provisions,
patience, and strong walls.

315
00:21:12,408 --> 00:21:14,877
<i>If they're wise, they'll
hide behind those walls</i>

316
00:21:14,911 --> 00:21:17,613
and chip away at us,
man by man.

317
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:21,617
I don't want half my army killed
before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.

318
00:21:21,651 --> 00:21:24,887
We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi.

319
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:27,591
Taking this city will not bring
you any closer to Westeros

320
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,893
or the Iron Throne.

321
00:21:32,363 --> 00:21:34,998
How many slaves
are there in Yunkai?

322
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:39,003
200,000, if not more.

323
00:21:39,037 --> 00:21:43,040
Then we have 200,000
reasons to take the city.

324
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,543
_

325
00:21:48,663 --> 00:21:53,149
_

326
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:57,247
_

327
00:23:23,806 --> 00:23:25,873
Now comes the noble
Razdal mo Eraz

328
00:23:25,908 --> 00:23:29,344
of that ancient
and honorable house,

329
00:23:29,411 --> 00:23:31,713
<i>master of men</i>
<i>and speaker to savages,</i>

330
00:23:31,747 --> 00:23:35,350
<i>to offer terms of peace.</i>

331
00:23:35,384 --> 00:23:37,652
Noble lord, you are
in the presence

332
00:23:37,686 --> 00:23:40,555
of Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen,

333
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:43,224
Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

334
00:23:43,258 --> 00:23:45,426
<i>Khaleesi</i>
<i>of the Great Grass Sea,</i>

335
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,796
<i>Breaker of Chains,</i>
<i>and Mother of Dragons.</i>

336
00:23:49,765 --> 00:23:53,034
You may approach.
Sit.

337
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:04,744
Will the noble lord
take refreshment?

338
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:19,759
Ancient and glorious is Yunkai.

339
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,427
Our empire was old

340
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,497
before dragons stirred
in old Valyria.

341
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:27,800
<i>Many an army has broken</i>
<i>against our walls.</i>

342
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:30,570
You shall find no easy
conquest here, khaleesi.

343
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,943
Good.
My Unsullied need practice.

344
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:38,945
I was told to blood them early.

345
00:24:39,012 --> 00:24:43,150
If blood is your desire,
blood shall flow.

346
00:24:44,252 --> 00:24:45,920
But why?

347
00:24:45,954 --> 00:24:49,289
'Tis true you have committed
savageries in Astapor.

348
00:24:49,324 --> 00:24:53,527
But the Yunkai are a forgiving
and generous people.

349
00:24:56,465 --> 00:24:59,400
The wise masters of Yunkai
have sent a gift

350
00:24:59,435 --> 00:25:01,068
for the silver queen.

351
00:25:06,842 --> 00:25:11,479
There is far more than this awaiting
you on the deck of your ship.

352
00:25:11,513 --> 00:25:13,547
- My ship?
- Yes, khaleesi.

353
00:25:13,582 --> 00:25:16,384
As I said,
we are a generous people.

354
00:25:16,418 --> 00:25:19,087
<i>You shall have as many
ships as you require.</i>

355
00:25:19,121 --> 00:25:21,189
And what do you ask in return?

356
00:25:21,223 --> 00:25:25,426
All we ask is that
you make use of these ships.

357
00:25:25,461 --> 00:25:27,962
Sail them back to Westeros
where you belong

358
00:25:27,997 --> 00:25:30,865
and leave us to conduct
our affairs in peace.

359
00:25:33,803 --> 00:25:36,138
I have a gift for you as well.

360
00:25:37,106 --> 00:25:39,541
- Your life.
- My life?

361
00:25:39,575 --> 00:25:41,276
And the lives
of your wise masters.

362
00:25:41,311 --> 00:25:44,880
But I also want
something in return.

363
00:25:44,914 --> 00:25:48,484
You will release
every slave in Yunkai.

364
00:25:48,518 --> 00:25:51,587
Every man, woman, and child
shall be given as much food,

365
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:53,422
clothing, and property
as they can carry

366
00:25:53,456 --> 00:25:56,759
as payment for their
years of servitude.

367
00:25:56,793 --> 00:25:58,827
Reject this gift,

368
00:25:58,861 --> 00:26:01,229
and I shall show you no mercy.

369
00:26:01,264 --> 00:26:03,265
You are mad.

370
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:05,100
<i>We are not Astapor or Qarth.</i>

371
00:26:05,134 --> 00:26:08,336
We are Yunkai and we have
powerful friends.

372
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:12,107
Friends who would take great
pleasure in destroying you.

373
00:26:12,141 --> 00:26:15,110
Those who survive,
we shall enslave once more.

374
00:26:15,144 --> 00:26:17,479
Perhaps we'll make
a slave of you as well.

375
00:26:19,615 --> 00:26:22,250
You swore me safe conduct.

376
00:26:22,285 --> 00:26:26,154
I did, but my dragons
made no promises.

377
00:26:26,188 --> 00:26:28,723
And you threatened
their mother.

378
00:26:28,758 --> 00:26:30,926
Take the gold.

379
00:26:40,469 --> 00:26:43,438
My gold. You gave
it to me, remember?

380
00:26:43,472 --> 00:26:45,240
And I shall put it to good use.

381
00:26:45,274 --> 00:26:48,109
You'd be wise to do the
same with my gift to you.

382
00:26:48,144 --> 00:26:49,759
Now get out.

383
00:26:53,682 --> 00:26:56,518
The Yunkish are a proud people.

384
00:26:56,552 --> 00:26:58,120
They will not bend.

385
00:26:58,154 --> 00:27:01,123
And what happens to things
that don't bend?

386
00:27:01,157 --> 00:27:03,192
He said he had
powerful friends.

387
00:27:03,226 --> 00:27:05,027
Who was he talking about?

388
00:27:05,061 --> 00:27:07,329
I don't know.

389
00:27:07,363 --> 00:27:09,765
Find out.

390
00:27:24,681 --> 00:27:27,216
Chains?

391
00:27:27,251 --> 00:27:30,487
Solid gold from the mines
outside Lannisport.

392
00:27:30,521 --> 00:27:32,690
Smithed in Casterly Rock.

393
00:27:32,724 --> 00:27:35,125
Golden chains.

394
00:27:36,528 --> 00:27:38,763
You could buy
a ship with these.

395
00:27:38,797 --> 00:27:40,531
- Do I need a ship?
- What?

396
00:27:40,566 --> 00:27:44,369
- Am I going somewhere?
- Of course you're not going anywhere.

397
00:27:44,403 --> 00:27:48,506
So, am I invited
to your wedding?

398
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:52,977
I didn't ask for this marriage.

399
00:27:53,012 --> 00:27:55,514
- I didn't want it.
- No?

400
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,850
She's a beautiful girl.
You said so yourself.

401
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,919
That doesn't mean that--

402
00:27:59,953 --> 00:28:02,154
this is duty, not desire.

403
00:28:02,189 --> 00:28:04,757
Is that what you will tell
yourself when you fuck her?

404
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:06,893
I don't have a choice.
My father--

405
00:28:06,928 --> 00:28:09,529
Does not rule the world.

406
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,269
We can still go
across the Narrow Sea.

407
00:28:15,303 --> 00:28:17,137
What would I do there?

408
00:28:17,172 --> 00:28:18,905
Juggle?

409
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,042
I am a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

410
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:24,677
And I'm Shae the funny whore.

411
00:28:24,712 --> 00:28:28,581
My feelings for you
have not changed.

412
00:28:28,615 --> 00:28:31,817
I will marry Sansa Stark
and do my duty by her.

413
00:28:31,851 --> 00:28:34,086
While I empty her chamber pot

414
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,888
and lick your cock
when you're bored?

415
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,423
I swear to you
it will not be like that.

416
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:41,259
No?
What will it be like?

417
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:46,664
I will buy you a good home
somewhere in the city.

418
00:28:46,699 --> 00:28:48,867
You will have fine clothes,

419
00:28:48,901 --> 00:28:51,670
guards to keep
you safe, servants.

420
00:28:53,874 --> 00:28:56,142
Any children we might have

421
00:28:56,176 --> 00:28:58,110
will be well provided for.

422
00:28:58,145 --> 00:29:00,512
Children?
You think I want children

423
00:29:00,547 --> 00:29:02,181
who can never see their father?

424
00:29:02,215 --> 00:29:03,782
Who would be killed
in their sleep

425
00:29:03,817 --> 00:29:06,118
if their grandfather
found out about them?

426
00:29:06,152 --> 00:29:08,019
Listen.

427
00:29:08,054 --> 00:29:10,321
Listen to me, my lady.

428
00:29:10,356 --> 00:29:12,690
- I'm not your lady.
- You are.

429
00:29:13,725 --> 00:29:15,960
You'll always be my lady.

430
00:29:19,831 --> 00:29:22,199
I'm your whore.

431
00:29:22,233 --> 00:29:25,569
And when you are tired
of fucking me,

432
00:29:25,603 --> 00:29:27,704
I will be nothing.

433
00:29:57,467 --> 00:30:00,136
- What happened?
- Wildfire.

434
00:30:01,371 --> 00:30:03,306
I should have been here.

435
00:30:05,075 --> 00:30:07,210
After all the running
and fighting,

436
00:30:07,244 --> 00:30:10,113
here I am,
back where I started.

437
00:30:10,147 --> 00:30:12,382
Do you miss it?

438
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:15,384
- King's Landing?
- Your father's house.

439
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:18,321
Never had a father.
Never wanted one.

440
00:30:18,355 --> 00:30:21,924
Haven't you ever wondered
where your strength came from?

441
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:23,726
Your talent for fighting?

442
00:30:23,761 --> 00:30:25,261
I'm lowborn.

443
00:30:25,295 --> 00:30:27,530
As low as can be.
My mother was a tavern wench.

444
00:30:27,564 --> 00:30:29,398
Mine was a slave.

445
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:31,434
So was I.

446
00:30:31,468 --> 00:30:33,470
Bought and sold,

447
00:30:33,504 --> 00:30:35,472
scourged and branded,

448
00:30:35,506 --> 00:30:37,774
until the Lord of Light
reached down,

449
00:30:37,808 --> 00:30:39,909
took me in his hand
and raised me up.

450
00:30:41,746 --> 00:30:43,313
I was born in Flea Bottom.

451
00:30:43,347 --> 00:30:45,782
Your blood is noble.

452
00:30:47,251 --> 00:30:50,087
Are you saying my father,

453
00:30:50,121 --> 00:30:52,623
he was some lord or...

454
00:30:52,657 --> 00:30:53,924
There.

455
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:56,193
Your father's house.

456
00:31:02,934 --> 00:31:04,602
I'm just a bastard.

457
00:31:06,805 --> 00:31:09,908
The bastard of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

458
00:31:09,942 --> 00:31:12,210
First of His Name,
King of the Andals

459
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,012
and the First Men.

460
00:31:14,046 --> 00:31:17,716
Why do you think
the gold cloaks wanted you?

461
00:31:19,318 --> 00:31:21,886
There is power
in a king's blood.

462
00:31:37,868 --> 00:31:40,236
Come sit by the fire, child.

463
00:31:42,973 --> 00:31:44,373
Not talking, eh?

464
00:31:44,408 --> 00:31:46,576
That's a first.

465
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,944
I don't talk to traitors.

466
00:31:51,381 --> 00:31:53,115
I didn't like
giving up the boy.

467
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,817
But you did.

468
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:58,020
You took the gold
and you gave him up.

469
00:31:59,088 --> 00:32:02,057
The Red God
is the one true god.

470
00:32:02,091 --> 00:32:04,526
You've seen his power.

471
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,761
When he commands, we obey.

472
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,798
He's not my one true god.

473
00:32:10,832 --> 00:32:14,335
No?
Who's yours?

474
00:32:16,805 --> 00:32:18,606
Death.

475
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:31,320
Spotted a Lannister
raiding party.

476
00:32:31,355 --> 00:32:33,823
- How many?
- <i>No more than 20.</i>

477
00:32:33,858 --> 00:32:36,493
- How far?
- Less than a day's ride south.

478
00:32:39,565 --> 00:32:42,099
What do you say, boys?
Time for a lion hunt?

479
00:32:42,134 --> 00:32:44,169
Yeah!

480
00:32:45,738 --> 00:32:47,339
But what about Riverrun?

481
00:32:47,373 --> 00:32:49,207
It's not south.
It's west of here.

482
00:32:49,242 --> 00:32:51,443
It will still be west of here
two days from now.

483
00:32:51,477 --> 00:32:54,613
- You swore.
- To take you home, and I will.

484
00:32:54,647 --> 00:32:56,815
But we need to do this first.

485
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,717
Why? So you can
steal their gold?

486
00:32:58,751 --> 00:33:00,285
I swear to you,
this isn't--

487
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:02,955
I don't care what you swear
because you're a liar.

488
00:33:02,989 --> 00:33:04,623
You lied to Gendry,
you lied to me.

489
00:33:04,657 --> 00:33:08,027
You'll lie to anyone. I hope
the Lannisters kill you all.

490
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:11,097
One day you'll understand,
but now--

491
00:33:13,601 --> 00:33:16,636
- Anguy, bring her back.
- Come back, girl!

492
00:33:41,295 --> 00:33:42,928
Kick all you like, wolf girl.

493
00:33:42,963 --> 00:33:45,431
Won't do you no good.

494
00:34:02,548 --> 00:34:04,616
I thought you were gone.

495
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,785
Tomorrow.

496
00:34:10,122 --> 00:34:13,124
Have they told you what
they plan to do with me?

497
00:34:14,726 --> 00:34:17,695
Lord Bolton's traveling
tomorrow as well.

498
00:34:17,729 --> 00:34:20,865
He's going to the Twins
for Edmure Tully's wedding.

499
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,301
You're to remain here.

500
00:34:23,335 --> 00:34:25,804
With Locke?

501
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:34,781
I owe you a debt.

502
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:40,586
When Catelyn Stark
released you,

503
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:43,323
we both made a promise to her.

504
00:34:43,357 --> 00:34:45,324
<i>Now it's your promise.</i>

505
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,060
You gave your word.

506
00:34:48,094 --> 00:34:49,661
Keep it

507
00:34:49,696 --> 00:34:52,664
and consider the debt paid.

508
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:56,734
I will return the Stark
girls to their mother.

509
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,004
I swear it.

510
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:07,979
Good-bye, Ser Jaime.

511
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:30,137
Here.
Let me.

512
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:39,447
It will take time.

513
00:35:45,087 --> 00:35:47,221
Qyburn hopes your father
will force the Citadel

514
00:35:47,255 --> 00:35:48,990
<i>to give him back his chain.</i>

515
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:50,892
My father will make
him Grand Maester

516
00:35:50,926 --> 00:35:53,394
if he grows me a new hand.

517
00:35:53,429 --> 00:35:57,332
You will give my regards
to Lord Tywin, I trust?

518
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:02,404
Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I
couldn't make his uncle's wedding.

519
00:36:02,438 --> 00:36:05,607
The Lannisters send
their regards.

520
00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:12,882
Safe journey, Kingslayer.

521
00:36:13,751 --> 00:36:15,185
Nothing to say?

522
00:36:15,219 --> 00:36:17,621
I liked you better before.

523
00:36:17,655 --> 00:36:20,957
I don't remember chopping
your balls off, too.

524
00:36:20,991 --> 00:36:23,893
And don't you worry
about your friend.

525
00:36:23,927 --> 00:36:27,063
We'll take good care of her.

526
00:36:45,648 --> 00:36:47,549
Shh.

527
00:37:11,273 --> 00:37:12,740
Gentle, my lord.

528
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:14,975
Gentle.

529
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:26,554
Shh shh shh.

530
00:37:26,588 --> 00:37:29,257
Myranda knows what she's doing.

531
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:30,959
Let her.

532
00:37:32,061 --> 00:37:34,262
She trained as a septa, only...

533
00:37:35,865 --> 00:37:38,566
she had other urges.

534
00:37:38,601 --> 00:37:42,437
So did the septons,
only they lied about it.

535
00:37:43,806 --> 00:37:45,507
Where is he?

536
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:47,041
Who, my lord?

537
00:37:47,076 --> 00:37:50,612
There's no one here
but you, me, and Violet.

538
00:37:51,747 --> 00:37:53,214
Please.

539
00:37:53,249 --> 00:37:55,450
Don't you want us to see it?

540
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:57,519
Oh, come on.
Let us see it.

541
00:37:57,553 --> 00:37:59,788
Everybody talks about it.

542
00:37:59,822 --> 00:38:02,825
He sent you.

543
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:04,359
Who sent us?

544
00:38:04,394 --> 00:38:06,462
We sent ourselves,
Lord Greyjoy.

545
00:38:06,496 --> 00:38:08,431
We heard so much about it.

546
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:12,769
- Please.
- Oh!

547
00:38:12,803 --> 00:38:15,339
There it is.

548
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:19,076
Oh.

549
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,779
Do you think we're ugly?

550
00:38:21,813 --> 00:38:23,847
He thinks we're ugly.

551
00:38:23,882 --> 00:38:25,783
Well, he's been
through so much.

552
00:38:25,817 --> 00:38:28,219
Look at his poor face.

553
00:38:29,755 --> 00:38:31,222
Help me.

554
00:38:32,557 --> 00:38:34,725
If he comes back...

555
00:38:36,695 --> 00:38:39,564
We need to make him
feel better.

556
00:38:39,598 --> 00:38:42,567
And how can we make
him feel better?

557
00:38:43,436 --> 00:38:45,303
I have an idea.

558
00:39:05,258 --> 00:39:08,460
Oh, she's shy.

559
00:39:08,495 --> 00:39:12,497
You know how they are,
these religious girls.

560
00:39:14,533 --> 00:39:16,701
Maybe he doesn't
know how we are.

561
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,314
Oh.

562
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:32,283
I felt something.

563
00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:38,423
Oh, Lord Greyjoy.

564
00:39:40,926 --> 00:39:43,395
- As good as they say?
- Mmm.

565
00:39:53,073 --> 00:39:55,440
And why should you
get all the fun?

566
00:40:05,085 --> 00:40:08,620
What?
You like her better?

567
00:40:12,426 --> 00:40:14,460
Plenty there for both of us.

568
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,664
I was here first.

569
00:40:25,771 --> 00:40:29,106
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

570
00:40:29,141 --> 00:40:31,208
Terrible timing.

571
00:40:34,746 --> 00:40:36,913
But I was getting jealous.

572
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:42,619
Well?

573
00:40:42,654 --> 00:40:46,190
Should we see this cock
everyone's always going on about?

574
00:40:58,103 --> 00:41:01,239
Everyone knows you love girls.

575
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:05,210
I bet you always thought
they loved you back.

576
00:41:14,455 --> 00:41:17,825
Your famous cock must be
very precious to you.

577
00:41:17,859 --> 00:41:21,829
Would you say it's
your most precious part?

578
00:41:24,933 --> 00:41:28,169
Please.

579
00:41:28,204 --> 00:41:31,138
No.

580
00:41:31,173 --> 00:41:33,241
<i>No!</i>
<i>Mercy, please!</i>

581
00:41:33,275 --> 00:41:35,243
<i>Please, mercy!</i>
<i>Mercy!</i>

582
00:41:35,277 --> 00:41:38,046
This is mercy.

583
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,281
I'm not killing you.

584
00:41:40,316 --> 00:41:44,386
<i>Just making a few alterations.</i>

585
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,991
No! No! No!

586
00:41:49,026 --> 00:41:50,827
Please, no! No!

587
00:41:50,861 --> 00:41:54,230
No! No, please!
Please!

588
00:41:57,033 --> 00:41:58,467
You're gonna scare it off.

589
00:41:58,502 --> 00:42:01,370
I'm not gonna scare it.
I'm gonna kill it.

590
00:42:03,173 --> 00:42:04,773
It's too far away.

591
00:42:27,762 --> 00:42:29,863
Is that a palace?

592
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:34,334
It's a windmill.

593
00:42:35,203 --> 00:42:37,104
Windmill.

594
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:40,641
Who built it?
Some king?

595
00:42:40,675 --> 00:42:43,010
Just the men
who used to live here.

596
00:42:43,044 --> 00:42:44,645
<i>They must have
been great builders,</i>

597
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:46,914
<i>stacking stones so high.</i>

598
00:42:46,948 --> 00:42:50,017
Winterfell has towers
three times that size.

599
00:42:50,051 --> 00:42:52,953
"I'm Jon Snow
and I'm from Winterfell.

600
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,154
My daddy was a fancy lord

601
00:42:54,189 --> 00:42:57,124
and I lived in a tower
that touched the clouds."

602
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,127
If you're impressed
by a windmill,

603
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:02,130
you'd be swooning if you saw
the Great Keep at Winterfell.

604
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:03,999
What's swooning?

605
00:43:04,033 --> 00:43:05,834
Fainting.

606
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:08,403
What's fainting?

607
00:43:11,174 --> 00:43:13,275
When a girl sees blood
and collapses.

608
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,478
Why would a girl
see blood and collapse?

609
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:18,347
Well...

610
00:43:18,382 --> 00:43:20,582
not all girls are like you.

611
00:43:21,751 --> 00:43:23,786
Well, girls see
more blood than boys.

612
00:43:24,988 --> 00:43:27,889
Or do you like girls
who swoon, Jon Snow?

613
00:43:27,924 --> 00:43:29,657
Oh, a spider!

614
00:43:29,692 --> 00:43:32,226
Save me, Jon Snow.

615
00:43:32,261 --> 00:43:34,562
My dress is made
of the purest silk

616
00:43:34,596 --> 00:43:36,964
from Tralalalaleeday.

617
00:43:36,998 --> 00:43:39,566
I'd like to see you
in a silk dress.

618
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:44,204
Would you?

619
00:43:46,407 --> 00:43:49,210
So I could tear it off you.

620
00:43:49,244 --> 00:43:52,179
Well, you rip
my pretty silk dress,

621
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:54,348
I'll blacken your eye.

622
00:44:00,989 --> 00:44:04,124
Maybe one day I'll take
you to Winterfell.

623
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,095
Or maybe one day
I'll take you there.

624
00:44:08,129 --> 00:44:10,430
After we've taken
our land back.

625
00:44:13,601 --> 00:44:15,235
Ygritte.

626
00:44:18,306 --> 00:44:20,475
You won't win.

627
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:24,312
I know your people are brave,
no one denies that.

628
00:44:24,347 --> 00:44:27,549
- You know nothing--
- Six times in the last thousand years,

629
00:44:27,584 --> 00:44:29,852
a King-beyond-the-Wall
has attacked the kingdoms.

630
00:44:29,886 --> 00:44:33,523
- Six times they failed.
- And how do you know that?

631
00:44:33,557 --> 00:44:35,458
Every boy in the North
knows it.

632
00:44:35,493 --> 00:44:36,927
We grow up learning it.

633
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:38,328
Where the battles were fought,

634
00:44:38,362 --> 00:44:40,096
the names of the heroes,
who died where.

635
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:41,998
Six times you've invaded

636
00:44:42,032 --> 00:44:45,201
and six times you've failed.

637
00:44:45,235 --> 00:44:47,236
The seventh will be the same.

638
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:50,472
- Mance is different.
- You don't have the discipline.

639
00:44:50,506 --> 00:44:54,075
You don't have the training.
Your army is no army.

640
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:55,510
You don't know
how to fight together.

641
00:44:55,544 --> 00:44:58,046
- You don't know that.
- I do.

642
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,847
I know it.

643
00:44:59,881 --> 00:45:02,216
If you attack the Wall,
you'll die.

644
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:04,151
All of you.

645
00:45:12,294 --> 00:45:14,428
All of <i>us.</i>

646
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:32,380
You're mine

647
00:45:32,414 --> 00:45:34,949
as I'm yours.

648
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:37,518
And if we die, we die.

649
00:45:38,587 --> 00:45:41,022
But first we'll live.

650
00:45:41,056 --> 00:45:45,026
Yes, first we'll live.

651
00:46:01,477 --> 00:46:04,145
What's he going on about?

652
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:06,548
And how come he always
gets to sit and chat

653
00:46:06,582 --> 00:46:08,650
while we do all the work?

654
00:46:11,587 --> 00:46:13,222
Hodor.

655
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:18,428
- That's where we are.
- What are you telling him?

656
00:46:18,462 --> 00:46:20,163
- It's all right, Osha.
- It's not all right.

657
00:46:20,197 --> 00:46:22,164
You think I can't
hear you every day?

658
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:23,833
Filling his head
with black magic.

659
00:46:23,867 --> 00:46:26,869
<i>Talking about visions and
three-eyed ravens and worse.</i>

660
00:46:26,904 --> 00:46:29,739
- Leave him alone.
- He can speak for himself.

661
00:46:29,774 --> 00:46:31,474
I don't fill his head
with anything.

662
00:46:31,508 --> 00:46:34,043
<i>So what do you talk about?</i>

663
00:46:34,078 --> 00:46:37,179
What's happening to him
and what that means.

664
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:39,781
Go on, then.
Tell us what it means.

665
00:46:39,816 --> 00:46:41,383
It's not like that.

666
00:46:41,417 --> 00:46:43,184
<i>I wish I could</i>
<i>tell him all the answers.</i>

667
00:46:43,219 --> 00:46:45,587
<i>It would be much easier.</i>

668
00:46:45,621 --> 00:46:48,389
I don't want you
talking to him anymore.

669
00:46:48,424 --> 00:46:49,891
Until we get to your brother
at Castle Black.

670
00:46:49,925 --> 00:46:52,860
- We're not going to Castle Black.
- What did you say?

671
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:56,396
I told you already.
Jon Snow isn't there.

672
00:46:56,431 --> 00:46:58,131
Bran needs to find
the raven beyond the Wall.

673
00:46:58,166 --> 00:46:59,800
Oh, no.
I'm not going back there.

674
00:46:59,834 --> 00:47:02,903
Your brother is at Castle Black.
That's where we're going.

675
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:06,440
Look at me.

676
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,743
The raven's been coming to me

677
00:47:09,778 --> 00:47:12,146
ever since I fell
from that tower.

678
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,949
He wants me to find him.

679
00:47:14,983 --> 00:47:18,352
I don't have my legs anymore.

680
00:47:18,387 --> 00:47:20,288
This is what I have now.

681
00:47:20,322 --> 00:47:22,490
You have a family.

682
00:47:22,524 --> 00:47:24,358
You need to go back
to Castle Black

683
00:47:24,393 --> 00:47:27,161
so you can get back to
them where you belong.

684
00:47:27,196 --> 00:47:30,165
What if I belong in the North?

685
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:34,502
What if I fell from
that tower for a reason?

686
00:47:34,536 --> 00:47:36,738
Is that what he's telling you?

687
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:38,940
That it's all for a reason?

688
00:47:38,974 --> 00:47:43,178
All these bad things happened because
the gods got big plans for you?

689
00:47:43,212 --> 00:47:45,180
I wish it were true,
little lord.

690
00:47:45,215 --> 00:47:49,385
But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's
cold shit for you or me or anyone.

691
00:47:49,419 --> 00:47:51,687
You don't understand.
You don't know.

692
00:47:51,722 --> 00:47:53,689
You don't know.
None of you know.

693
00:47:53,723 --> 00:47:55,958
None of you have been up there.

694
00:47:59,062 --> 00:48:01,396
I had a man once.

695
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:03,165
A good man.

696
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:04,967
Bruni, his name was.

697
00:48:05,002 --> 00:48:08,004
I was his and he was mine.

698
00:48:08,038 --> 00:48:11,006
But one night Bruni disappears.

699
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:13,642
People said he left me,

700
00:48:13,676 --> 00:48:15,010
but I knew him.

701
00:48:15,044 --> 00:48:18,980
<i>He'd never leave me.</i>
<i>Not for long.</i>

702
00:48:19,014 --> 00:48:21,383
I knew he'd come back.

703
00:48:23,052 --> 00:48:25,153
And he did.

704
00:48:26,389 --> 00:48:29,558
<i>He came in through</i>
<i>the back of the hut.</i>

705
00:48:30,427 --> 00:48:32,395
Only it wasn't Bruni.

706
00:48:32,429 --> 00:48:34,997
Not really.

707
00:48:35,032 --> 00:48:38,568
His skin was pale

708
00:48:38,602 --> 00:48:41,971
like a dead man's.

709
00:48:42,006 --> 00:48:44,841
His eyes bluer than clear sky.

710
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,348
<i>He came at me,</i>

711
00:48:50,382 --> 00:48:52,350
grabbed me by the neck

712
00:48:52,384 --> 00:48:55,220
and squeezed so hard

713
00:48:55,254 --> 00:48:58,090
I could feel the life
slipping out of me.

714
00:49:00,393 --> 00:49:02,828
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>how I got the knife.</i>

715
00:49:02,862 --> 00:49:05,765
<i>When I did, I stuck it</i>

716
00:49:05,799 --> 00:49:08,501
deep into his heart.

717
00:49:11,672 --> 00:49:14,440
And he hardly seemed to notice.

718
00:49:15,843 --> 00:49:20,146
<i>I had to burn our hut down</i>
<i>with him inside.</i>

719
00:49:22,549 --> 00:49:25,284
I didn't ask the gods
what it meant.

720
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:29,054
I didn't need to.
I already knew.

721
00:49:29,089 --> 00:49:32,257
<i>It meant the North</i>
<i>was no place for men to be.</i>

722
00:49:32,292 --> 00:49:34,560
<i>Not anymore.</i>

723
00:49:36,897 --> 00:49:39,132
I promised your maester
I'd get you to Castle Black

724
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:41,734
and no further.

725
00:49:50,043 --> 00:49:51,877
How is the
pain, my lord?

726
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,982
What's the purpose
of an arm with no hand?

727
00:50:01,686 --> 00:50:04,521
Well, we've stymied
the corruption.

728
00:50:04,556 --> 00:50:07,358
Yes, we've stymied
the corruption.

729
00:50:07,392 --> 00:50:09,460
You're a learned man.

730
00:50:09,494 --> 00:50:11,095
All the good it's done me.

731
00:50:11,129 --> 00:50:13,297
You did well
sewing up this mess.

732
00:50:13,331 --> 00:50:15,666
You're far better
at this sort of work

733
00:50:15,701 --> 00:50:18,369
than Grand Maester Pycelle.

734
00:50:18,404 --> 00:50:21,005
Faint praise, my lord.

735
00:50:22,441 --> 00:50:25,844
So why did the Citadel
take your chain?

736
00:50:25,878 --> 00:50:27,845
Did you fondle
one boy too many?

737
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,149
No, my lord.
That's not my weakness.

738
00:50:32,618 --> 00:50:34,919
What is?

739
00:50:37,189 --> 00:50:38,723
Curiosity.

740
00:50:38,757 --> 00:50:42,727
The only way to treat disease
is to understand disease.

741
00:50:42,761 --> 00:50:45,029
And the only way
to understand it

742
00:50:45,064 --> 00:50:47,432
is to study the afflicted.

743
00:50:47,466 --> 00:50:50,135
You performed experiments
on living men.

744
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:52,037
- On dying men.
- With their permission?

745
00:50:52,072 --> 00:50:55,108
My studies
have given me insight

746
00:50:55,142 --> 00:50:56,810
that has saved many lives.

747
00:50:56,844 --> 00:50:59,212
Dying paupers, I assume.

748
00:50:59,246 --> 00:51:02,815
Men with no families
to complain.

749
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:04,651
You found them moaning
in the poorhouse

750
00:51:04,685 --> 00:51:07,120
and had them carted
back to your garret

751
00:51:07,154 --> 00:51:10,423
and opened up their bellies
to see what was inside.

752
00:51:10,458 --> 00:51:12,892
How many men have
you killed, my lord?

753
00:51:12,927 --> 00:51:14,561
I don't know.

754
00:51:14,595 --> 00:51:17,731
50? 100?

755
00:51:19,501 --> 00:51:21,569
Countless.

756
00:51:21,603 --> 00:51:23,605
Countless has
a nice ring to it.

757
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:25,941
And how many lives
have you saved?

758
00:51:25,975 --> 00:51:28,810
Half a million.

759
00:51:29,912 --> 00:51:32,247
The population
of King's Landing.

760
00:51:37,354 --> 00:51:40,856
You were in charge
of the ravens at Harrenhal.

761
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:45,093
Did you-- did you get a bird off
to Brienne's father in Tarth?

762
00:51:45,128 --> 00:51:47,729
A bird flew off
and a bird flew back.

763
00:51:48,964 --> 00:51:51,332
Lord Selwyn Tarth

764
00:51:51,367 --> 00:51:55,069
offered 300 gold dragons for
his daughter's safe return.

765
00:51:55,104 --> 00:51:58,940
- A fair offer.
- A fair offer. Locke won't take it.

766
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:02,511
Why not?

767
00:52:02,545 --> 00:52:03,912
He's convinced Lord Tarth

768
00:52:03,947 --> 00:52:06,648
owns all the sapphire
mines in Westeros.

769
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:10,386
He feels he's being cheated.

770
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,589
They'd be fools to kill her.

771
00:52:12,623 --> 00:52:15,058
These men have been
at war a long time.

772
00:52:15,093 --> 00:52:17,260
Most of them
will be dead by winter.

773
00:52:17,295 --> 00:52:20,230
She'll be their
entertainment tonight.

774
00:52:20,264 --> 00:52:22,499
Beyond tonight,

775
00:52:22,533 --> 00:52:24,801
I don't think
they care very much.

776
00:52:43,954 --> 00:52:46,356
We have to return to Harrenhal.

777
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:47,823
Why?

778
00:52:47,858 --> 00:52:49,325
I've left something behind.

779
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:50,960
Absolutely not.

780
00:52:50,994 --> 00:52:52,962
I've got orders
from Lord Bolton.

781
00:52:52,996 --> 00:52:54,530
And what are those orders?

782
00:52:54,564 --> 00:52:58,067
To deliver you to your
father at King's Landing.

783
00:52:58,101 --> 00:53:00,336
You think you'll get a reward.

784
00:53:02,372 --> 00:53:05,140
I serve Lord Bolton.

785
00:53:05,174 --> 00:53:06,708
Any appreciation
your father--

786
00:53:06,742 --> 00:53:08,076
You think
you're getting a reward.

787
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:09,410
Let me explain
something to you.

788
00:53:09,444 --> 00:53:11,445
When my father sees me,
the first thing

789
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,847
he's going to ask
is what happened to my hand.

790
00:53:13,881 --> 00:53:17,117
And I'm going to tell him
this man chopped it off.

791
00:53:17,151 --> 00:53:20,987
- I had nothing--
- Or I could tell him this man saved my life.

792
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:25,259
We return to Harrenhal now.

793
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:46,813
Whoa.

794
00:53:48,316 --> 00:53:50,718
- Eyes open, lads.
- Be quiet.

795
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:58,927
<i>♪ The bear, the bear
and the maiden fair ♪</i>

796
00:53:58,961 --> 00:54:00,996
<i>♪ From there to here,</i>
<i>from here to there ♪</i>

797
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:03,365
<i>♪ All black and brown</i>
<i>and covered in hair ♪</i>

798
00:54:03,399 --> 00:54:05,767
♪ He smelled that girl
in the summer air ♪

799
00:54:05,802 --> 00:54:08,003
♪ The bear, the bear,
and the maiden fair! ♪

800
00:54:12,475 --> 00:54:14,509
<i>Don't spare her.</i>

801
00:54:14,544 --> 00:54:17,078
<i>Don't spare her!</i>

802
00:54:18,781 --> 00:54:22,350
Well, this is one shameful
fucking performance.

803
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:24,018
Stop running and fight.

804
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,095
A wooden sword?

805
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:35,932
- I thought you'd gone.
- You gave her a wooden sword.

806
00:54:35,966 --> 00:54:37,734
We've only got one bear.

807
00:54:37,768 --> 00:54:39,402
I'll pay her bloody ransom.

808
00:54:39,436 --> 00:54:41,404
Gold, sapphires,
whatever you want.

809
00:54:41,438 --> 00:54:43,039
Just get her out of there.

810
00:54:43,073 --> 00:54:45,441
All you lords and ladies

811
00:54:45,475 --> 00:54:48,377
still think that the only
thing that matters is gold.

812
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:51,814
This makes me happier
than all your gold ever could.

813
00:54:51,848 --> 00:54:54,917
And that makes me happier
than all her sapphires.

814
00:54:54,951 --> 00:54:57,353
So go buy yourself
a golden hand

815
00:54:57,387 --> 00:55:00,022
and fuck yourself with it.

816
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:12,568
Ah!

817
00:55:18,908 --> 00:55:20,442
- Get behind me.
- I will not.

818
00:55:31,353 --> 00:55:33,788
What the fuck are you
doing to my bear?

819
00:55:33,822 --> 00:55:35,723
Lord Bolton charged me
with bringing him back

820
00:55:35,757 --> 00:55:38,792
to King's Landing alive
and that's what I aim to do.

821
00:55:42,296 --> 00:55:44,230
Pull her up.

822
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:59,344
Hold my legs.

823
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:23,801
Pull him up!

824
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,214
The bitch stays.

825
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:40,718
We're taking her
to King's Landing.

826
00:56:40,752 --> 00:56:42,386
Unless you kill me.

827
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,624
She belongs to me.

828
00:56:46,658 --> 00:56:49,560
Lord Bolton's orders.

829
00:56:49,594 --> 00:56:52,363
What do you think is more
important to Lord Bolton?

830
00:56:52,397 --> 00:56:54,098
Getting his pet rat a reward

831
00:56:54,132 --> 00:56:57,468
or ensuring Tywin Lannister
gets his son back alive?

832
00:57:17,791 --> 00:57:20,760
Well, we must be on our way.

833
00:57:24,298 --> 00:57:26,466
Sorry about the sapphires.

834
