2
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:34,653
<i>- Look out!</i>
<i>- Fire! Fire!</i>

3
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,881
A band of 20
men, maybe less.

4
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,133
They were in and out
before anyone spotted them.

5
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:07,102
Burnt our food stores
to the ground,

6
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,354
all our siege weapons destroyed.

7
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,723
- Dozens of tents were--
- Horses?

8
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,892
We're still getting a count,
but hundreds are dead.

9
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,613
20 men rode into our camp without a
single guard sounding the alarm?

10
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:20,148
The northerners know more about
their land than we ever will.

11
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,817
Put last night's guards
in chains.

12
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,535
Either they fell asleep or
they conspired with the enemy.

13
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:27,155
- Find out the truth and then hang them.
- Your Grace.

14
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:30,409
Unless there's a thaw, we can't
press forward to Winterfell

15
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,045
and we don't have enough food
to get us back to Castle Black.

16
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,913
We're not returning
to Castle Black.

17
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,333
Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed
to be an expert in military matters,

18
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,970
but if we can't march forward
and we won't march back...

19
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:57,853
Have the dead horses
butchered for meat.

20
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:40,729
<i>Halt!</i>

21
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,699
<i> Halt!</i>

22
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:48,904
<i> There it is!</i>

23
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:30,746
Open the gates.

24
00:05:46,295 --> 00:05:48,747
It was a failure.

25
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,550
It wasn't.

26
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,802
I went to save them.
I failed.

27
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,639
You didn't fail him.

28
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,024
Or him.

29
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,860
<i>Or her.</i>

30
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:05,363
Every one of them is alive
because of you and no one else.

31
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:09,317
I don't think that
fact's lost on them.

32
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,675
You have a good heart, Jon Snow.

33
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:09,177
It'll get us all killed.

34
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,135
Out of my way.

35
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:44,746
You sent for me, Your Grace?

36
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,048
Find some healthy horses and
a few knights to guard you.

37
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,084
I'm sending you back
to Castle Black.

38
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:51,336
Tell the Lord Commander
his king commands him

39
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,755
to send food, supplies,
fresh horses.

40
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:55,557
In return,
when I take the throne,

41
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:58,593
I'll make sure the Night's Watch
has all the men it requires.

42
00:07:58,595 --> 00:08:01,930
He can guard all 19 castles
on the Wall if he so wishes.

43
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,235
Your Grace,
you named me your Hand.

44
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,837
Yes.

45
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:10,822
The King's Hand should
never abandon the king,

46
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:12,274
especially in time of war.

47
00:08:12,276 --> 00:08:14,125
You're not abandoning me.
You're obeying a command.

48
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,578
A boy with a scroll
could deliver this message.

49
00:08:16,612 --> 00:08:19,164
And if Jon Snow refuses
the boy with the scroll,

50
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,416
what does the boy say?

51
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,618
I didn't name you Hand for your
expertise in military matters.

52
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,121
Ride for Castle Black.
Don't come back empty-handed.

53
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:34,930
Your Grace, perhaps Queen Selyse

54
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:36,848
and Princess Shireen
could accompany me.

55
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:38,934
My family stays with me.

56
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:40,969
At least let me take Shireen.

57
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,555
<i>A siege is no place</i>
<i>for a little girl.</i>

58
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,974
My family stays with me.

59
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:23,833
What's this one now?

60
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:26,202
"The Dance of Dragons:
A True Telling"

61
00:09:26,253 --> 00:09:27,670
by Grand Maester Munkun.

62
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:31,040
Now that sounds
like a proper story.

63
00:09:31,091 --> 00:09:33,709
Ser Byron Swann wanted
to kill the dragon Vhagar.

64
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,712
He polished his shield for a week
so that it was like a mirror.

65
00:09:36,763 --> 00:09:38,798
And he crouched behind it
and crept forward,

66
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,850
hoping the dragon would
only see its own reflection.

67
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:43,969
But the dragon saw a dumb man
holding a mirrored shield.

68
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,688
And burnt him to a crisp.

69
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,308
Thus ending
the dragon-slaying career

70
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,144
of Ser Byron Swann.

71
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:56,782
I made you something, Princess.

72
00:10:03,323 --> 00:10:04,657
Do you like it?

73
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:06,575
He's beautiful.

74
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:09,328
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

75
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,881
Will you make me a doe, too?
So that he can have company?

76
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:13,749
Of course I will.

77
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:16,836
But why am I getting a present?

78
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:19,922
Because you deserve it.

79
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:25,094
My son was always on me,
trying to teach me to read.

80
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:27,480
Gods, I was stubborn about it.

81
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:30,432
Made it this far
without reading.

82
00:10:30,484 --> 00:10:32,985
Seemed to me I could
make it to the grave.

83
00:10:35,238 --> 00:10:37,189
Wish I'd listened to him.

84
00:10:38,692 --> 00:10:41,026
This is my own poor way
of saying thank you.

85
00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:46,832
For teaching me
to be a grown-up.

86
00:10:49,503 --> 00:10:52,288
I'll be gone for a
few days, Princess.

87
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:55,007
I want to hear all about "The
Dance of Dragons" when I'm back.

88
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,293
You'll read it yourself.

89
00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:20,232
Prince Doran.

90
00:11:20,283 --> 00:11:22,868
Forgive us.
We started without you.

91
00:11:23,737 --> 00:11:25,621
<i>Please, sit.</i>

92
00:11:25,705 --> 00:11:28,157
Princess Myrcella.

93
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:29,825
Uncle.

94
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,710
What a lovely dress.

95
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:34,046
- You don't like it?
- You must be cold.

96
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,716
Not at all. The Dornish
climate agrees with me.

97
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:41,587
Prince Trystane.

98
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,924
How's your jaw?

99
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:47,760
A fleabite.

100
00:11:47,762 --> 00:11:49,395
What are you doing in Dorne?

101
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:51,697
Looking after the safety of my
niece, the Princess Myrcella.

102
00:11:51,731 --> 00:11:55,067
And rather than send a raven
or speak to me directly,

103
00:11:55,101 --> 00:11:57,436
you decided to enter
my country in secret

104
00:11:57,438 --> 00:11:59,104
and abduct our guest by force?

105
00:11:59,106 --> 00:12:02,358
We received
a threatening message.

106
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:05,611
The princess's necklace
in the jaws of a viper.

107
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:08,948
That necklace
was stolen from my room.

108
00:12:13,937 --> 00:12:17,706
Oh, excellent.

109
00:12:17,757 --> 00:12:19,959
A last meal before
the beheading?

110
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:21,543
Oh, I can't behead you.

111
00:12:21,595 --> 00:12:24,013
Many in Dorne want war.

112
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:26,031
But I've seen war.

113
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:28,801
I've seen the bodies
piled on the battlefields.

114
00:12:28,803 --> 00:12:32,321
I've seen the orphans
starving in the cities.

115
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:34,440
I don't want to lead
my people into that hell.

116
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:37,142
No, you want to break bread
with the Lannisters.

117
00:12:37,193 --> 00:12:39,812
And that is precisely
what we are doing.

118
00:12:41,648 --> 00:12:45,234
Let us drink to Tommen,
the First of His Name,

119
00:12:45,285 --> 00:12:47,770
<i>King of the Andals</i>
<i>and the First Men,</i>

120
00:12:47,804 --> 00:12:49,989
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

121
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:09,842
King Tommen insists

122
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:12,845
on his sister's return
to the capital?

123
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:15,014
I'm afraid he does.

124
00:13:17,017 --> 00:13:20,152
I cannot disobey
my king's command.

125
00:13:20,186 --> 00:13:22,655
She will return with you
to King's Landing.

126
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:26,108
<i>And my son Prince Trystane</i>
<i>will accompany you both.</i>

127
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:29,778
If the alliance between the Iron
Throne and Dorne is to continue,

128
00:13:29,863 --> 00:13:31,280
their engagement must stand.

129
00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:33,415
I accept.

130
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,118
One more thing.
My brother was named

131
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:38,837
to the small council
before his death.

132
00:13:38,872 --> 00:13:40,789
Your father understood
the importance

133
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:42,658
<i>of keeping Dorne in the fold.</i>

134
00:13:42,692 --> 00:13:47,262
With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take
his place on the small council.

135
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:48,447
You have my word.

136
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:50,966
The word of a kingslayer.

137
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:57,523
No wonder you can't stand.
You have no spine.

138
00:13:57,557 --> 00:13:59,808
You are mother
to four of my nieces,

139
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:01,610
girls I love very much.

140
00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:04,446
For their sake, I hope you
live a long and happy life.

141
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:06,982
Speak to me that way
again, and you won't.

142
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:18,460
May I inquire as to the
fate of my man Bronn?

143
00:14:18,495 --> 00:14:21,580
Tell me, Ser Jaime,
in King's Landing,

144
00:14:21,631 --> 00:14:24,917
how do they punish a commoner
who strikes a prince?

145
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:26,518
He said it was just a fleabite.

146
00:14:29,255 --> 00:14:30,672
The fault is mine.

147
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:32,958
Bronn is merely a soldier
following my orders.

148
00:14:33,026 --> 00:14:36,562
If anyone should
be punished, it's me.

149
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:39,431
Prince Trystane must learn
judgment if he is to rule one day.

150
00:14:39,516 --> 00:14:41,233
I'll let him decide.

151
00:14:46,022 --> 00:14:48,657
I have learned the value
of mercy from my father.

152
00:14:48,691 --> 00:14:52,094
- <i> I'll set your man free.</i>
- You're a good man.

153
00:14:52,128 --> 00:14:54,980
On one condition.

154
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:05,040
Why do we play?
I'm better than you.

155
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:07,426
I'll always be better than you.

156
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,295
Have I ever missed once?

157
00:15:10,297 --> 00:15:13,215
I don't think I have.
I can't recall.

158
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:15,851
You must love humiliation.
Or pain.

159
00:15:15,885 --> 00:15:19,555
Which do you love most,
humiliation or pain?

160
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,524
That one hurt, didn't it?

161
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,527
You going to cry?

162
00:15:25,562 --> 00:15:27,479
Give up, little sister.

163
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:29,565
- You're going to miss.
- Oh, I never miss.

164
00:15:29,616 --> 00:15:32,901
You will.
You're thinking too much.

165
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:35,988
Now you're nervous.
What if she's right?

166
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:42,211
- Luck.
- Now it's my turn.

167
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:43,879
You're too slow.

168
00:15:43,913 --> 00:15:45,747
You've always been too slow.

169
00:16:02,515 --> 00:16:04,349
Am I gonna be happy
at the end of this walk?

170
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,435
You'll find out very soon.

171
00:16:09,355 --> 00:16:11,190
Say it one more time, handsome.

172
00:16:11,192 --> 00:16:12,658
Who am I?

173
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:16,578
The most beautiful
woman in the world.

174
00:16:16,613 --> 00:16:17,996
And that's the truth.

175
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:20,666
Slut.

176
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,668
Prince Doran,

177
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:25,704
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

178
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:28,123
I didn't realize there were
knights of the Blackwater.

179
00:16:28,157 --> 00:16:29,758
Only the one.

180
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:32,344
I believe you've already
met Prince Trystane.

181
00:16:32,378 --> 00:16:34,546
Prince.

182
00:16:34,597 --> 00:16:36,348
Sorry about the other day.

183
00:16:36,382 --> 00:16:38,851
<i>Prince Trystane
here is a man of mercy.</i>

184
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:41,220
He's agreed to grant
you your freedom.

185
00:16:42,856 --> 00:16:44,890
I'm glad to hear it.

186
00:16:46,442 --> 00:16:47,726
Pie looks good.

187
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:50,395
There was one condition.

188
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:01,823
Perhaps some soup instead.

189
00:17:03,793 --> 00:17:07,212
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

190
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:12,167
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

191
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:16,054
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

192
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,257
Oysters, clams,
and cock--

193
00:17:18,308 --> 00:17:19,975
How much for your little clam?

194
00:17:28,601 --> 00:17:31,486
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

195
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:37,409
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

196
00:18:05,305 --> 00:18:07,306
Come on.

197
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,361
<i>Some oysters, girl!</i>

198
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:15,063
<i>I'm talking to you.</i>

199
00:18:15,114 --> 00:18:17,449
Is, uh...

200
00:18:19,535 --> 00:18:20,786
- Girl!
<i>-  Tie her up!</i>

201
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,206
<i>Are you deaf? Girl!</i>

202
00:18:25,491 --> 00:18:27,209
Girl!

203
00:18:32,382 --> 00:18:33,999
My lord.

204
00:18:37,587 --> 00:18:39,638
<i>My lord.</i>

205
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:41,423
<i>Lord Tyrell.</i>

206
00:18:41,474 --> 00:18:43,008
On behalf of the Iron Bank,

207
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,977
may I be the first
to welcome you

208
00:18:45,011 --> 00:18:46,728
to the Free City of Braavos.

209
00:18:46,763 --> 00:18:48,730
I hope your journey
was trouble-free.

210
00:18:48,765 --> 00:18:50,482
A bit of chop the last few days.

211
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:52,601
Nothing too awful.

212
00:18:52,652 --> 00:18:55,070
Good to see the old chap
still guarding the harbor.

213
00:18:55,104 --> 00:18:57,406
And how goes the
harvest in the Reach?

214
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,825
Ah, the vintners say
this might be

215
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:03,028
the best year for red
grapes in half a century.

216
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:06,164
<i>If we come to a
satisfactory arrangement,</i>

217
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:11,036
I'll be sure to send a cask of
the Arbor's finest your way.

218
00:19:11,087 --> 00:19:13,705
I'm afraid I don't partake.

219
00:19:13,707 --> 00:19:15,757
Oh.

220
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:25,467
Some consider usury
distasteful, dishonorable.

221
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:27,135
Pure nonsense, of course.

222
00:19:27,186 --> 00:19:29,471
I'm glad we see eye to
eye on this matter.

223
00:19:29,522 --> 00:19:31,890
<i>Did you know that at
one point Maegor the third</i>

224
00:19:31,941 --> 00:19:34,776
tried to outlaw it
in the Seven Kingdoms?

225
00:19:34,811 --> 00:19:36,945
Wanted to arrest anyone
caught charging interest

226
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:39,648
<i>and cut off both their hands.</i>

227
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:41,783
Most unfortunate
for the glovers.

228
00:19:41,818 --> 00:19:43,952
<i>If a man charges
no interest on a loan,</i>

229
00:19:43,986 --> 00:19:46,104
<i>then he has nothing to gain</i>
<i>and everything to lose,</i>

230
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:47,572
<i>so why chance it?</i>

231
00:19:47,623 --> 00:19:49,374
<i>Whereas the promise of reward</i>

232
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:51,960
<i>makes a man willing to gamble.</i>

233
00:19:51,994 --> 00:19:55,414
We are not gamblers here at
the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.

234
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:57,883
You are the world's
best gamblers.

235
00:19:57,917 --> 00:20:01,753
And all those bets
you won built this.

236
00:20:12,932 --> 00:20:14,349
We should celebrate.

237
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,902
I'm afraid I still have
a good deal of work to do.

238
00:20:16,936 --> 00:20:19,020
<i>Oh, nonsense. Work's over.
Do you sing?</i>

239
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:20,772
- I don't have that gift.
- Oh, it's not a gift.

240
00:20:20,774 --> 00:20:21,940
It's a skill.
Anyone can learn it.

241
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:26,528
♪ So give me a kiss
by the Long Canal ♪

242
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:30,499
♪ And give me two kisses
in Salty Town ♪

243
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:35,537
♪ For we're going
to die tomorrow ♪

244
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:39,207
♪ The bareheaded beggar,
the king with his crown... ♪

245
00:20:39,258 --> 00:20:41,343
<i>Thought that old shit
would never stop singing.</i>

246
00:20:41,377 --> 00:20:43,345
Wasn't bad, though.

247
00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:45,964
The Tyrells can all rot in hell.

248
00:20:46,015 --> 00:20:47,682
Treasonous cunts.

249
00:20:47,717 --> 00:20:50,602
They were going to make
that boy-fucker Renly king.

250
00:20:51,804 --> 00:20:53,555
This is the place, lads.

251
00:20:53,606 --> 00:20:56,024
The sleekest little minks
in Braavos.

252
00:20:56,058 --> 00:20:58,944
- You buying?
- Oh, I'm buying.

253
00:20:58,978 --> 00:21:01,146
But I never was good at sharing.

254
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:24,336
Sell your fish somewhere else.

255
00:21:24,338 --> 00:21:27,222
Oh, let her in, Brusco.
I'm hungry.

256
00:21:27,256 --> 00:21:29,174
Come here, sweetness.

257
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:36,181
They say oysters
get the juices flowing.

258
00:21:36,183 --> 00:21:38,433
We'll take half a dozen.

259
00:21:40,186 --> 00:21:42,103
Three coppers.

260
00:21:42,155 --> 00:21:45,524
Here's a silver because
the lady likes you.

261
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:13,635
Too old.

262
00:22:17,056 --> 00:22:18,390
Brea.

263
00:22:33,556 --> 00:22:35,123
Too old.

264
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:40,662
<i>I have just the one.
Anara.</i>

265
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:44,082
<i>Our most expensive girl.</i>

266
00:22:45,218 --> 00:22:48,303
<i>But well worth it, I assure you.</i>

267
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:55,110
Too old.

268
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:04,803
Do you have what I want or not?

269
00:23:04,837 --> 00:23:08,690
Of course.
Of course.

270
00:23:14,113 --> 00:23:16,114
These fresh?

271
00:23:19,752 --> 00:23:22,754
Come on, the lads are hungry.

272
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:30,545
Nothing better for your
cockstand than fresh oysters.

273
00:23:30,596 --> 00:23:32,636
<i>- Here. Thank you.</i>
<i>- I'll have one.</i>

274
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:35,667
<i>Any vinegar?</i>

275
00:23:36,886 --> 00:23:38,954
Who let this girl in?
Shoo! Shoo!

276
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,493
Good.

277
00:24:11,003 --> 00:24:12,671
I'll tell you when we're done.

278
00:24:18,344 --> 00:24:20,345
You'll have a fresh one
for me tomorrow?

279
00:24:20,396 --> 00:24:22,731
Of course.

280
00:24:27,186 --> 00:24:28,937
<i>I'll have
you whipped, girl.</i>

281
00:24:28,988 --> 00:24:31,356
Go, go on.
Out, out, go.

282
00:24:43,202 --> 00:24:45,120
Valar morghulis.

283
00:24:45,204 --> 00:24:47,205
Valar morghulis.

284
00:25:02,638 --> 00:25:04,055
And?

285
00:25:04,057 --> 00:25:06,808
The thin man
wasn't hungry today.

286
00:25:06,842 --> 00:25:08,943
Perhaps that is why
a man is thin.

287
00:25:08,978 --> 00:25:10,729
Tomorrow.

288
00:25:10,763 --> 00:25:13,898
Tomorrow.

289
00:25:14,984 --> 00:25:17,018
A girl has work to do.

290
00:25:30,266 --> 00:25:33,868
Your rebellion is over.

291
00:25:33,903 --> 00:25:36,704
You can swear your
allegiance to me now...

292
00:25:38,174 --> 00:25:40,091
or you can die.

293
00:26:15,294 --> 00:26:17,595
I believe in second chances.

294
00:26:19,548 --> 00:26:22,300
I don't believe
in third chances.

295
00:26:50,546 --> 00:26:52,664
You write like
a seven-year-old.

296
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,501
Your maester kindly agreed
to copy it over for me.

297
00:26:56,552 --> 00:26:58,052
<i>He didn't try to make you pay?</i>

298
00:26:58,087 --> 00:26:59,804
Mm-mmm.

299
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,973
Maybe he's changed.

300
00:27:02,007 --> 00:27:05,260
The queen will be thrilled to know
you're bringing her daughter home.

301
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,561
She will.

302
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:09,013
You love her very much,
don't you?

303
00:27:09,064 --> 00:27:11,566
Of course, she's my niece.

304
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,518
I wasn't talking about her.

305
00:27:15,654 --> 00:27:17,522
You think I disapprove?

306
00:27:17,524 --> 00:27:19,190
Why?

307
00:27:19,192 --> 00:27:22,193
Because people disapprove of that
sort of thing where you are from?

308
00:27:22,244 --> 00:27:25,413
They disapproved of Oberyn
and me where you are from.

309
00:27:25,447 --> 00:27:29,167
Here no one blinked an eye.

310
00:27:30,452 --> 00:27:31,669
100 years ago,

311
00:27:31,704 --> 00:27:34,372
no one would have
blinked an eye at you

312
00:27:34,456 --> 00:27:36,207
if you'd been named Targaryen.

313
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,180
It's always changing, who we're
supposed to love and who we're not.

314
00:27:43,382 --> 00:27:45,550
The only thing
that stays the same

315
00:27:45,552 --> 00:27:48,419
is that we want who we want.

316
00:27:58,147 --> 00:28:00,532
I know your daughter had no
part in the terrible thing

317
00:28:00,566 --> 00:28:02,700
that happened to the man I love.

318
00:28:05,387 --> 00:28:07,872
Perhaps even you
are innocent of that.

319
00:28:26,308 --> 00:28:28,309
Father.

320
00:28:31,764 --> 00:28:33,097
Aren't you cold?

321
00:28:35,434 --> 00:28:37,518
No. What are you reading?

322
00:28:38,988 --> 00:28:41,155
- "The Dance of Dragons."
- What's it about?

323
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,675
It's the story of the fight
between Rhaenyra Targaryen

324
00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:46,995
and her half-brother Aegon for
control over the Seven Kingdoms.

325
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:49,831
Both of them thought they
belonged on the Iron Throne.

326
00:28:49,865 --> 00:28:53,117
When people started declaring
for one of them or the other,

327
00:28:53,168 --> 00:28:55,420
their fight divided
the kingdoms in two.

328
00:28:55,454 --> 00:28:58,840
Brothers fought brothers,
dragons fought dragons.

329
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:04,462
By the time it was over,
thousands were dead.

330
00:29:04,513 --> 00:29:07,465
And it was a disaster
for the Targaryens as well.

331
00:29:07,516 --> 00:29:10,268
They never truly recovered.

332
00:29:10,302 --> 00:29:12,303
"The Dance of Dragons."

333
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:16,107
Why is that a dance?

334
00:29:16,141 --> 00:29:17,609
It's just what they call it.

335
00:29:17,643 --> 00:29:19,811
Hmm, doesn't make much sense.

336
00:29:19,895 --> 00:29:21,813
I think it's poetic.

337
00:29:28,654 --> 00:29:31,205
If you had to choose

338
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,575
between Rhaenyra and Aegon...

339
00:29:36,161 --> 00:29:37,662
who would you have chosen?

340
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,248
I wouldn't have chosen either.

341
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:43,468
It's all the choosing sides that
made everything so horrible.

342
00:29:43,502 --> 00:29:45,803
Sometimes a person
has to choose.

343
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,142
Sometimes the world
forces his hand.

344
00:29:53,145 --> 00:29:56,014
If a man knows what he is...

345
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:00,234
and remains true to himself...

346
00:30:03,689 --> 00:30:05,907
the choice is no choice at all.

347
00:30:05,991 --> 00:30:09,027
He must fulfill his destiny...

348
00:30:11,246 --> 00:30:14,699
and become
who he is meant to be.

349
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:19,253
However much he may hate it.

350
00:30:20,506 --> 00:30:23,374
It's all right, Father.

351
00:30:23,425 --> 00:30:26,260
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

352
00:30:26,295 --> 00:30:28,046
It doesn't matter.

353
00:30:28,097 --> 00:30:30,348
I want to help you.

354
00:30:30,382 --> 00:30:32,050
Is there any way I can help?

355
00:30:39,892 --> 00:30:41,309
Yes, there is.

356
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,194
Good. I want to.

357
00:30:46,014 --> 00:30:48,232
I'm the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

358
00:30:48,234 --> 00:30:50,535
And I'm your daughter.

359
00:31:04,817 --> 00:31:06,751
Forgive me.

360
00:31:47,876 --> 00:31:50,261
Where's my father?
I want to see my father.

361
00:31:50,295 --> 00:31:53,431
It will all be over
soon, Princess.

362
00:31:57,402 --> 00:31:58,853
No.

363
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,691
Where's my father?

364
00:32:03,725 --> 00:32:06,210
No, you can't do this.
Father, where are you?

365
00:32:06,245 --> 00:32:08,696
<i>Please, let me see my father.</i>

366
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:11,566
<i>Father, where are you?</i>
<i>Don't let her do this.</i>

367
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:15,286
Please let go!

368
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,623
<i>Let me see my father!</i>
<i>Where are you? Please!</i>

369
00:32:18,657 --> 00:32:20,992
- It's what the Lord wants.
- No.

370
00:32:21,043 --> 00:32:24,078
- <i> Please! Let go! No!</i>
- It's a good thing.

371
00:32:24,129 --> 00:32:26,247
- A great thing.
<i>-  Stop. Stop!</i>

372
00:32:26,298 --> 00:32:28,166
<i>- Please!</i>
<i>- Hear us now, my Lord.</i>

373
00:32:28,168 --> 00:32:30,968
<i>- You can't do this!</i>
<i>- For you, we offer up this girl</i>

374
00:32:31,003 --> 00:32:33,805
- Please!
-<i>...that you may cleanse her with your fire</i>

375
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:35,807
and that its light
may lead our way.

376
00:32:35,841 --> 00:32:37,842
<i> Please! No, please
let me see my father.</i>

377
00:32:37,893 --> 00:32:40,061
If we don't act,
we'll all starve here.

378
00:32:40,095 --> 00:32:42,063
<i> All of us.</i>

379
00:32:42,097 --> 00:32:43,764
But if we make this sacrifice...

380
00:32:43,816 --> 00:32:46,017
<i>Accept this token
of our faith, my Lord,</i>

381
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:48,903
and lead us from the darkness.

382
00:32:48,937 --> 00:32:51,906
- Lord of Light, show us the way.
- Mother!

383
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:54,075
Mother, please!

384
00:32:56,028 --> 00:32:57,528
Mother, please!
Mother!

385
00:32:57,579 --> 00:32:59,664
- <i> Mother!</i>
- We can't.

386
00:32:59,698 --> 00:33:01,699
- There's no other way. She has king's blood.
-<i> Please don't do this!</i>

387
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:03,701
<i>Lord of
Light, protect us.</i>

388
00:33:03,785 --> 00:33:07,705
- Please! Father, please!
-<i> For the night is dark and full of terrors.</i>

389
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:09,423
Father!

390
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:11,459
Father, don't do this!
Please!

391
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:14,879
Mother, no! Please!
Please, help!

392
00:33:14,881 --> 00:33:17,215
Don't do this!

393
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,934
Please, Father!
Mother, help!

394
00:33:19,968 --> 00:33:23,304
- No.
-<i> No, please! Don't do this!</i>

395
00:33:23,355 --> 00:33:26,641
<i>Don't do this, please, Mother!</i>

396
00:33:26,725 --> 00:33:30,561
<i>Please, Mother!</i>
<i>Mother, help!</i>

397
00:33:30,563 --> 00:33:33,614
Mother, help!
Help!

398
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:35,783
<i>Please don't do this, Mother!</i>

399
00:33:35,817 --> 00:33:37,235
<i>Please!</i>

400
00:33:37,286 --> 00:33:39,487
<i>Please, Mother!</i>
<i>Please!</i>

401
00:33:39,538 --> 00:33:41,622
<i>Please! No!</i>

402
00:33:41,657 --> 00:33:45,493
<i>Please! No!</i>

403
00:34:02,594 --> 00:34:05,646
No!

404
00:34:55,197 --> 00:34:56,814
Where have you been?

405
00:34:56,816 --> 00:34:58,983
Just making sure
everything is in order.

406
00:35:19,505 --> 00:35:23,341
_

407
00:35:23,585 --> 00:35:26,713
_

408
00:35:27,186 --> 00:35:29,330
_

409
00:35:30,096 --> 00:35:31,118
_

410
00:35:31,747 --> 00:35:34,563
_

411
00:36:29,574 --> 00:36:32,243
They're waiting for you.

412
00:36:32,245 --> 00:36:34,245
Clap your hands.

413
00:37:03,609 --> 00:37:05,276
That one, the smaller man.

414
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:07,111
No question, that's where
you should put your money.

415
00:37:07,113 --> 00:37:08,529
The smaller man it is.

416
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,448
I'm not putting
my money anywhere.

417
00:37:10,499 --> 00:37:12,616
Kings and queens
never bet on the games.

418
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:14,952
Perhaps you should go
find someone who does.

419
00:37:14,954 --> 00:37:17,922
People used to bet against me
when I fought in the pits.

420
00:37:17,956 --> 00:37:20,958
He would have bet against me.
Common novice mistake.

421
00:37:21,009 --> 00:37:23,043
I've spent much
of my life in this arena.

422
00:37:23,095 --> 00:37:25,096
And in my experience,
large men do triumph

423
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:27,431
over smaller men
far more often than not.

424
00:37:27,466 --> 00:37:30,351
Has your experience ever
involved any actual fighting?

425
00:37:30,385 --> 00:37:32,019
You yourself?

426
00:37:32,053 --> 00:37:34,972
Have you ever tried to kill another
man who was trying to kill you?

427
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:39,894
Whenever I got into the pit
against a beast like that one,

428
00:37:39,945 --> 00:37:42,613
the crowd saw me, all
skin and bone back then,

429
00:37:42,647 --> 00:37:45,950
then they saw a pile of angry
muscles ready to murder me.

430
00:37:45,984 --> 00:37:48,152
They couldn't get their
money out fast enough.

431
00:37:48,203 --> 00:37:51,655
But the pile of angry muscles
never had any muscles here

432
00:37:51,706 --> 00:37:55,075
or... here.

433
00:37:55,127 --> 00:37:56,827
And the big men
were always too slow

434
00:37:56,912 --> 00:37:59,747
to stop my dagger from going
where their muscles weren't.

435
00:37:59,798 --> 00:38:03,634
Yes, whenever I saw a beast like
that one standing across from me

436
00:38:03,668 --> 00:38:07,755
making his beast faces,
I knew I could rest easy.

437
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:21,602
You don't approve?

438
00:38:21,653 --> 00:38:24,522
There's always been more than enough
death in the world for my taste.

439
00:38:24,573 --> 00:38:26,524
I can do without it
in my leisure time.

440
00:38:26,575 --> 00:38:29,026
Fair enough. Yet it's
an unpleasant question,

441
00:38:29,028 --> 00:38:33,447
but what great thing has ever been
accomplished without killing or cruelty?

442
00:38:33,532 --> 00:38:36,784
It's easy to confuse what is
with what ought to be,

443
00:38:36,835 --> 00:38:39,587
especially when what is
has worked out in your favor.

444
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:41,121
I'm not talking about myself.

445
00:38:41,173 --> 00:38:43,791
I'm talking about the necessary
conditions for greatness.

446
00:38:43,842 --> 00:38:45,759
That is greatness?

447
00:38:45,794 --> 00:38:49,713
That is a vital part of the
great city of Meereen,

448
00:38:49,764 --> 00:38:52,216
which existed
long before you or I

449
00:38:52,267 --> 00:38:56,353
and will remain standing long after
we have returned to the dirt.

450
00:38:56,388 --> 00:38:58,389
My father would have liked you.

451
00:39:06,948 --> 00:39:10,701
_

452
00:39:10,735 --> 00:39:13,037
One day your great city will
return to the dirt as well.

453
00:39:13,071 --> 00:39:15,322
- At your command?
- If need be.

454
00:39:15,442 --> 00:39:16,671
_

455
00:39:20,662 --> 00:39:23,914
And how many people will die
to make this happen?

456
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:27,334
If it comes to that, they will
have died for a good reason.

457
00:39:27,385 --> 00:39:29,470
Those men think they're
dying for a good reason.

458
00:39:29,504 --> 00:39:31,255
Someone else's reason.

459
00:39:31,306 --> 00:39:33,641
So your reasons are true
and theirs are false?

460
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:36,560
They don't know their
own minds, but you do?

461
00:39:36,595 --> 00:39:39,597
Well said.
You're an eloquent man.

462
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,315
Doesn't mean you're wrong.

463
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:43,517
In my experience,
eloquent men are right

464
00:39:43,568 --> 00:39:45,319
every bit as often as imbeciles.

465
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:47,166
_

466
00:39:47,606 --> 00:39:51,325
_

467
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:55,700
_

468
00:40:12,887 --> 00:40:15,266
- Your Grace--
- Shut your mouth.

469
00:42:41,696 --> 00:42:43,831
- You can end this.
- She cannot.

470
00:42:43,865 --> 00:42:46,417
You can.

471
00:44:23,965 --> 00:44:26,466
Protect your queen!

472
00:44:37,028 --> 00:44:38,779
Go!

473
00:45:02,887 --> 00:45:04,888
Your Grace!
Your Grace!

474
00:45:04,923 --> 00:45:06,139
<i>Come with me.</i>
<i>I know a way out.</i>

475
00:45:06,174 --> 00:45:07,591
I know a way--

476
00:45:43,428 --> 00:45:44,544
Stay close.

477
00:45:52,103 --> 00:45:53,520
This way.

478
00:46:04,899 --> 00:46:06,066
The other side.

479
00:46:06,117 --> 00:46:08,285
Follow me.

480
00:46:10,538 --> 00:46:12,656
Protect your queen!

481
00:49:06,497 --> 00:49:08,331
Drogon!

482
00:50:10,444 --> 00:50:12,562
