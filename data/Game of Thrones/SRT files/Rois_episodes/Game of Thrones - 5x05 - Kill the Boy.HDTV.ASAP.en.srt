1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,533
When I had refused the throne,
Aerys reigned,

2
00:00:04,653 --> 00:00:07,087
whom they called the Mad King.

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,283
You're Aemon Targaryen.

4
00:00:09,403 --> 00:00:12,305
- What happened to your face?
- Greyscale.

5
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:14,916
Everyone advised me to send
you to the ruins of Valyria,

6
00:00:15,036 --> 00:00:17,270
to live out your short
life with the Stone Men.

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,690
Two of my sisters had it. They were
covered with it. They acted like animals.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,763
Hide! Hide!

9
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:30,942
Put him in chains.

10
00:00:31,062 --> 00:00:34,758
You want me alive so you can torture me?

11
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:36,553
Sansa Stark?

12
00:00:36,673 --> 00:00:41,349
I saw her riding on the East Road
with Littlefinger. We'll follow them.

13
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:45,259
- May I introduce my son, Ramsay Bolton.
- My Lady.

14
00:00:46,597 --> 00:00:50,613
Welcome home, Lady Stark.
The North remembers.

15
00:00:52,713 --> 00:00:54,873
You let a half-wit escape with a cripple,

16
00:00:54,993 --> 00:00:56,911
and Rickon too, the little one.

17
00:00:57,031 --> 00:00:59,984
I told you what would happen
if you served me loyally.

18
00:01:00,104 --> 00:01:02,266
And what would happen if you did not.

19
00:01:09,598 --> 00:01:11,893
- Who are you?
- Your captor.

20
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:14,194
You said you're taking me to the queen.

21
00:01:14,314 --> 00:01:15,777
Queen Daenerys Targaryen.

22
00:01:15,998 --> 00:01:19,560
You're the Mother of Dragons.
Show your strength.

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,184
No one's seen Drogon in weeks. For all I
know, he's flown halfway across the world.

24
00:01:24,304 --> 00:01:27,287
The Wise Masters ask for the reopening
of the fighting pits.

25
00:01:27,407 --> 00:01:29,326
Where slaves fought slaves to the death?

26
00:01:29,446 --> 00:01:33,524
Opening them would show the people of
Meereen that you respect their traditions.

27
00:01:33,644 --> 00:01:37,601
Traditions are the only thing
that will hold this city together.

28
00:03:26,838 --> 00:03:37,109
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

29
00:04:20,652 --> 00:04:23,020
I'm so sorry, my queen.

30
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:24,905
He was a good man.

31
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,325
"Barristan the Bold"
they called him.

32
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,397
He crossed a continent
to serve me.

33
00:04:31,431 --> 00:04:33,933
He was a loyal friend.

34
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:38,104
And he died in an alley,

35
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:41,190
butchered by cowards
who hide behind masks.

36
00:04:43,827 --> 00:04:46,445
We could pull back
to the pyramid district,

37
00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:49,782
<i>secure it, and use it as a
base from which to operate.</i>

38
00:04:49,784 --> 00:04:52,952
Then we clean the city out,

39
00:04:53,003 --> 00:04:56,856
<i>neighborhood by neighborhood,
street by street,</i>

40
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,158
until the rats
have nowhere left to hide.

41
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:05,631
I prefer
your earlier suggestion.

42
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:09,468
Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's
great families and bring them to me.

43
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:14,723
But I'm the leader of my family.

44
00:05:16,861 --> 00:05:18,282
No, Your Grace!

45
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:21,363
I had nothing to do with this.

46
00:05:21,398 --> 00:05:23,315
Your Grace!

47
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,264
_

48
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,749
_

49
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:13,782
_

50
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:27,559
_

51
00:06:28,282 --> 00:06:29,678
_

52
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:32,245
_

53
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:34,725
_

54
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,879
_

55
00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:44,035
_

56
00:06:47,462 --> 00:06:48,658
_

57
00:06:56,362 --> 00:06:59,379
_

58
00:07:54,217 --> 00:07:55,968
Don't want to overfeed them.

59
00:07:59,723 --> 00:08:01,640
Tomorrow perhaps.

60
00:08:37,811 --> 00:08:41,096
"And though Daenerys maintains
her grip on Slaver's Bay,

61
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:44,566
forces rise against her
from within and without.

62
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:46,685
She refuses to leave
until the freedom

63
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:49,521
of the former slaves
is secure."

64
00:08:50,857 --> 00:08:52,608
She sounds like quite a woman.

65
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:54,526
And she's alone,

66
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:56,161
under siege,

67
00:08:56,196 --> 00:08:59,581
no family to guide her
or protect her.

68
00:08:59,616 --> 00:09:03,702
Her last relation
thousands of miles away,

69
00:09:03,737 --> 00:09:07,289
useless, dying.

70
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:11,543
Don't say that, Maester Aemon.

71
00:09:11,628 --> 00:09:16,632
A Targaryen alone in the world

72
00:09:16,683 --> 00:09:19,218
is a terrible thing.

73
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:23,939
Maester Aemon.

74
00:09:23,973 --> 00:09:26,225
Lord Commander.

75
00:09:26,276 --> 00:09:29,228
Sam, I'd like to speak
to the maester alone.

76
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:46,245
How are you feeling?

77
00:09:46,296 --> 00:09:48,914
Oh, like
a hundred-year-old man

78
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:51,383
slowly freezing to death.

79
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:58,557
I need your advice.

80
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:01,143
There's something I want
to do, something I...

81
00:10:01,177 --> 00:10:02,594
have to do.

82
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:05,047
But it'll divide
the Night's Watch.

83
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:06,683
Bitterly.

84
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:09,437
Half the men will hate me
the moment I give the order.

85
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:13,779
Half the men hate you
already, Lord Commander.

86
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,864
Do it.

87
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:17,727
But you don't know what it is.

88
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:19,551
That doesn't matter.

89
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,954
You do.

90
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,793
You will find little joy
in your command.

91
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,379
But with luck,

92
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:33,975
you will find the strength
to do what needs to be done.

93
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,588
Kill the boy, Jon Snow.

94
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,141
Winter is almost upon us.

95
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,927
Kill the boy

96
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,047
and let the man be born.

97
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,492
Where are the rest
of the free folk now?

98
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,327
Where have they gone?

99
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,800
Who leads them?

100
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,303
They followed Mance.

101
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,727
They won't follow anyone else.

102
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,588
What about you?

103
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:22,525
Hard to lead
when you're in chains.

104
00:11:26,113 --> 00:11:27,814
What if I unchained you?

105
00:11:27,865 --> 00:11:29,181
Why would you do that?

106
00:11:30,918 --> 00:11:33,820
Because you are not my enemy.

107
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:35,538
And I'm not yours.

108
00:11:35,573 --> 00:11:38,458
You sure seemed like my enemy
when you were killing my friends.

109
00:11:38,492 --> 00:11:41,244
For 8,000 years the Night's
Watch have sworn an oath

110
00:11:41,295 --> 00:11:44,295
to be the shield that
guards the realms of men.

111
00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:48,468
And for 8,000 years we've
fallen short of that oath.

112
00:11:48,502 --> 00:11:51,588
You belong to the realms of men.

113
00:11:51,622 --> 00:11:53,590
All of you.

114
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:56,426
And now everything
is going to change?

115
00:11:56,428 --> 00:11:58,428
- It is.
- Why now?

116
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:02,482
Because now I am Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

117
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:05,652
What would you have me do,

118
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:08,104
Lord Commander?

119
00:12:09,774 --> 00:12:11,858
I'd have you go
north of the Wall.

120
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:15,695
Gather the remaining free folk wherever
they are and bring them back here.

121
00:12:15,746 --> 00:12:19,282
I'll open the gates for
them and let them through.

122
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,419
I'll find them lands to
settle south of the Wall.

123
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:26,039
They won't kneel for you
and neither will I.

124
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,958
I don't want them
to kneel for me.

125
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,461
I want them to fight with
me when the time comes.

126
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:34,264
The day I ask my people
to fight with the crows

127
00:12:34,298 --> 00:12:37,217
is the day my people
cut my guts from my belly

128
00:12:37,268 --> 00:12:38,301
and make me eat them.

129
00:12:38,352 --> 00:12:41,271
And how many of your
people can't fight?

130
00:12:41,305 --> 00:12:44,391
The women, the children,
the old, the sick--

131
00:12:44,442 --> 00:12:46,276
what happens to them?

132
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,361
You're condemning them to death.

133
00:12:48,396 --> 00:12:52,182
Worse than death because you're
too proud to make peace.

134
00:12:55,619 --> 00:12:57,721
Or maybe you're not proud.

135
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:01,241
Maybe you're just a coward.

136
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:11,251
Easy thing to say
to a man in chains.

137
00:13:35,743 --> 00:13:37,410
Your people need a leader.

138
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:40,697
And they need to get south of
the Wall before it's too late.

139
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:42,832
We don't have much time
and they have less.

140
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:45,785
The walkers are coming and
they'll hit your people first.

141
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:50,373
I'm not asking you to make
peace to save your skin.

142
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:54,210
Make peace to save your people.

143
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:04,888
Most of them are at Hardhome.

144
00:14:04,922 --> 00:14:06,222
You know where that is?

145
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:08,108
Up on Storrold's Point.

146
00:14:08,142 --> 00:14:10,310
I can give you 10 horses
and nine other men.

147
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:12,241
You can get there in a week.

148
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:13,897
We'll need ships.

149
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:17,901
I'll talk to King Stannis
about lending you his fleet.

150
00:14:21,288 --> 00:14:22,872
All right, then.

151
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:26,910
You're coming with me.

152
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:30,580
<i>You're the Lord Commander</i>
<i>of the Night's Watch.</i>

153
00:14:30,631 --> 00:14:32,916
They need to hear it from you.

154
00:14:32,918 --> 00:14:35,218
They need to know
the ships they are boarding

155
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:37,470
won't be torched
in the middle of the sea.

156
00:14:37,505 --> 00:14:42,675
You come with me or I don't go.

157
00:14:50,602 --> 00:14:53,403
You'd bring wildlings here
through our gates?

158
00:14:53,437 --> 00:14:56,940
Men, women, and children will die
by the thousands if we do nothing.

159
00:14:56,991 --> 00:15:00,193
Let them die. We got our
own to worry about.

160
00:15:00,244 --> 00:15:03,196
Less enemies for us.

161
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:04,948
Fewer.

162
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:07,717
- What?
- Nothing.

163
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:11,588
Look, well, there is
good farmland in the Gift.

164
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:13,957
Land that no one uses now.

165
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:16,009
A dozen abandoned villages.

166
00:15:16,043 --> 00:15:18,178
And why do you think the farmers
abandoned those villages?

167
00:15:18,212 --> 00:15:21,491
<i>Because the wildlings</i>
<i>raided them for years.</i>

168
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:23,061
Cut them down!

169
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,304
Just like they did this boy's people.

170
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:28,241
Aye!

171
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:31,911
<i>We've been fighting
them for thousands of years.</i>

172
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:33,996
They've slaughtered villages.

173
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:36,028
<i>They've slaughtered</i>
<i>our brothers.</i>

174
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:38,301
And we've slaughtered theirs.

175
00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:43,611
I will follow you
anywhere, you know that.

176
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:47,676
- But they killed Grenn.
- Yes.

177
00:15:47,677 --> 00:15:49,744
- And they killed Pyp.
- Aye.

178
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:52,503
<i>They killed 50 of our brothers.</i>

179
00:15:52,623 --> 00:15:54,934
<i>I can't forget that.</i>

180
00:15:54,985 --> 00:15:56,103
I can't forgive it.

181
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:58,346
You were at the Fist
of the First Men.

182
00:15:58,907 --> 00:16:01,610
If we abandon them,
you know what they become.

183
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,770
<i>We can learn to live</i>
<i>with the wildlings</i>

184
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:06,746
<i>or we can add them</i>
<i>to the army of the dead.</i>

185
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,167
Whatever they are now,
they're better than that.

186
00:16:39,027 --> 00:16:40,895
Thank you.

187
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:42,563
<i>Olly.</i>

188
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,235
<i>If you have something</i>
<i>you want to say to me,</i>

189
00:16:47,237 --> 00:16:48,953
<i>say it.</i>

190
00:16:55,711 --> 00:16:57,745
It's all right.

191
00:16:59,164 --> 00:17:01,249
You don't mean it, do you?

192
00:17:02,885 --> 00:17:05,503
Telling the wildlings
you want to make peace.

193
00:17:05,554 --> 00:17:07,538
You're just doing it
to trick them.

194
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:09,090
It's not a trick.

195
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:10,675
They burned my village.

196
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:12,760
They put an arrow
through my father's head

197
00:17:12,762 --> 00:17:13,962
right in front of me.

198
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:17,632
They butchered my mother,
everyone I ever knew.

199
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,326
I know what it's like
to lose the people you love.

200
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:32,747
I know this is hard for you.

201
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:37,118
But winter is coming.

202
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,655
We know what's coming with it.

203
00:17:40,689 --> 00:17:42,590
We can't face it alone.

204
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:51,015
Will there be anything else
you need, Lord Commander?

205
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:55,853
No.

206
00:18:29,338 --> 00:18:31,706
She's far away
from the Lannisters.

207
00:18:32,574 --> 00:18:34,175
<i>This is her home.</i>

208
00:18:37,328 --> 00:18:39,446
Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.

209
00:18:40,698 --> 00:18:43,083
Better off with the Boltons

210
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:45,786
who murdered
her mother and brother?

211
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:57,180
Sansa's in danger even
if she doesn't realize it.

212
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:13,030
Thank you.

213
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:17,230
You've lived here a long time?

214
00:19:18,486 --> 00:19:20,203
Aye.

215
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:22,956
Did you know Lord Eddard?

216
00:19:24,545 --> 00:19:27,160
I knew him

217
00:19:27,162 --> 00:19:29,713
and his father before him.

218
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:33,834
The Starks are gone now.

219
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:35,669
Not all of them.

220
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,505
<i>I know who's inside that castle.</i>

221
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:40,424
Everyone knows.

222
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:41,908
The Boltons.

223
00:19:41,943 --> 00:19:44,303
I'm not talking
about the Boltons.

224
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,931
I need to get a message to her.

225
00:19:47,982 --> 00:19:49,816
To Sansa Stark.

226
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:53,146
Who are you?

227
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:56,356
Someone who swore
to keep her safe.

228
00:19:56,358 --> 00:19:58,158
Swore to who?

229
00:19:58,192 --> 00:20:00,360
Her mother.

230
00:20:00,395 --> 00:20:02,279
Her mother's dead.

231
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,082
That doesn't release me
from an oath.

232
00:20:07,752 --> 00:20:10,704
I served Lady Catelyn.

233
00:20:10,706 --> 00:20:13,340
I serve her still.

234
00:20:14,842 --> 00:20:16,810
Who do you serve?

235
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:25,302
<i>Come back here.</i>

236
00:20:29,006 --> 00:20:30,190
Myranda.

237
00:20:30,224 --> 00:20:32,292
I saw you staring at her.

238
00:20:32,326 --> 00:20:34,027
I'm going to marry her.

239
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:37,147
That will involve looking
at her from time to time.

240
00:20:40,735 --> 00:20:42,486
You said you'd marry me.

241
00:20:43,704 --> 00:20:45,405
And I meant it.

242
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,541
When I was a bastard named Snow.

243
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:49,826
<i>But I'm a Bolton now.</i>

244
00:20:49,877 --> 00:20:54,014
What I want is no longer
the primary consideration.

245
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:56,416
I'm furthering a dynasty.

246
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,754
Do you think she's pretty?

247
00:21:00,805 --> 00:21:03,490
Of course I do.

248
00:21:03,524 --> 00:21:04,925
I'm not blind.

249
00:21:18,072 --> 00:21:20,323
You think she's pretty, too.

250
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:25,612
I'm looking forward
to our wedding night.

251
00:21:25,663 --> 00:21:29,449
But don't worry, I'll have
plenty of time for you.

252
00:21:29,451 --> 00:21:32,035
Perhaps I'll marry, too.

253
00:21:36,924 --> 00:21:40,043
You're the kennel
master's daughter.

254
00:21:40,094 --> 00:21:43,296
Who are you going to marry,
the stable keeper's son?

255
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,471
You're mine.

256
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:54,524
You're not going anywhere.

257
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,479
Unless I have to listen
to more of your jealousy.

258
00:21:56,595 --> 00:22:00,113
Jealousy bores me. You remember
what happens to people who bore me.

259
00:22:02,817 --> 00:22:06,736
You're not going to bore
me, are you, Myranda?

260
00:22:25,172 --> 00:22:26,756
Never.

261
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:55,252
Beg pardon, my lady.

262
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:57,621
I've come to refill
the wash basin.

263
00:22:57,672 --> 00:22:59,539
Oh, I don't need--

264
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:03,093
You still have
friends in the North.

265
00:23:03,127 --> 00:23:04,756
If you're ever in trouble,

266
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:08,765
light a candle in the highest
window of the broken tower.

267
00:23:09,707 --> 00:23:12,385
- But who--
- You're not alone.

268
00:23:50,141 --> 00:23:52,392
I like your dress.

269
00:23:53,715 --> 00:23:55,562
Who made it for you?

270
00:23:55,596 --> 00:23:58,231
I made it myself.

271
00:23:58,265 --> 00:24:00,266
Really?

272
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:03,987
Who-- who are you?

273
00:24:04,021 --> 00:24:07,072
I'm Myranda, the kennel
master's daughter.

274
00:24:10,494 --> 00:24:11,778
May I?

275
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:19,919
Oh, wonderful.

276
00:24:19,954 --> 00:24:21,955
The stitching.

277
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,392
- Who taught you?
- My mother.

278
00:24:26,488 --> 00:24:30,513
I'm sorry for what
happened to her.

279
00:24:30,548 --> 00:24:31,848
Thank you.

280
00:24:33,634 --> 00:24:35,802
It's good that she taught you.

281
00:24:35,804 --> 00:24:37,303
It was a gift.

282
00:24:37,355 --> 00:24:42,308
Now every time you wear
something you made,

283
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,144
you can remember her.

284
00:24:44,146 --> 00:24:45,679
I'd rather have a mother.

285
00:24:45,713 --> 00:24:49,449
I know.
It's not the same.

286
00:24:49,483 --> 00:24:52,728
Still, it's good to remember.

287
00:24:52,952 --> 00:24:55,372
Remember the way things were.

288
00:24:57,124 --> 00:24:59,626
I almost forgot.

289
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,495
There's something else

290
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:04,914
<i>to help you remember.</i>

291
00:25:14,392 --> 00:25:16,843
Down there at the end.

292
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:19,562
What is it?

293
00:25:19,597 --> 00:25:21,514
That would spoil the surprise.

294
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,935
Go ahead, it's perfectly safe.

295
00:25:25,986 --> 00:25:28,154
You won't believe it
when you see it.

296
00:26:30,684 --> 00:26:32,051
Theon?

297
00:26:41,979 --> 00:26:44,347
You shouldn't be here.

298
00:27:04,451 --> 00:27:08,421
You smell particularly
ripe this evening.

299
00:27:10,744 --> 00:27:13,009
Pour me some wine.

300
00:27:37,151 --> 00:27:39,319
Do you have
something to tell me?

301
00:27:40,654 --> 00:27:41,966
No, my lord.

302
00:27:42,086 --> 00:27:43,990
Reek.

303
00:27:47,928 --> 00:27:49,829
She saw me.

304
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:51,331
Who?

305
00:27:51,382 --> 00:27:54,217
Sansa.
Lady Sansa.

306
00:27:54,251 --> 00:27:55,919
She came to the kennels.

307
00:27:57,115 --> 00:27:58,365
She saw you?

308
00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:00,617
Yes.
I'm sorry, master.

309
00:28:00,668 --> 00:28:02,536
Forgive me.
I didn't think--

310
00:28:02,587 --> 00:28:04,538
Come here.

311
00:28:12,797 --> 00:28:15,599
You mustn't keep
secrets from me, Reek.

312
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:17,467
Get on your knees.

313
00:28:29,981 --> 00:28:31,898
Give me your hand.

314
00:28:54,005 --> 00:28:55,839
I forgive you.

315
00:29:07,018 --> 00:29:10,153
I trust you find your
chamber suitable, my lady.

316
00:29:10,188 --> 00:29:12,355
Yes, thank you, my lord.

317
00:29:12,357 --> 00:29:14,191
Allow me.

318
00:29:17,995 --> 00:29:19,613
Mother.

319
00:29:19,664 --> 00:29:21,581
Thank you, Ramsay.

320
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:36,346
My lady, we are all a
family, we northerners.

321
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,800
Our blood ties go back
thousands of years.

322
00:29:39,851 --> 00:29:42,819
So I'd like to drink
to our wedding.

323
00:29:42,854 --> 00:29:46,223
May our happiness
spread from Moat Cailin

324
00:29:46,225 --> 00:29:47,390
to the Last Hearth.

325
00:29:47,442 --> 00:29:49,359
To your wedding.

326
00:29:49,393 --> 00:29:51,311
To your wedding.

327
00:29:57,869 --> 00:30:01,204
It must be difficult for you
being in a strange place.

328
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:04,074
This isn't a strange place.
This is my home.

329
00:30:04,076 --> 00:30:06,357
It's the people who are strange.

330
00:30:10,665 --> 00:30:12,466
You're right.

331
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,050
Very strange.

332
00:30:17,255 --> 00:30:18,889
More wine, please.

333
00:30:25,396 --> 00:30:28,115
<i>I heard you two had reunited.</i>

334
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:31,184
A fitting place for it.

335
00:30:33,104 --> 00:30:36,439
I like to imagine that
the last time you spoke

336
00:30:36,491 --> 00:30:38,441
was in this very room.

337
00:30:41,112 --> 00:30:43,780
<i>Are you still angry with him</i>

338
00:30:43,831 --> 00:30:45,699
<i>after he...</i>

339
00:30:50,338 --> 00:30:51,538
what he did?

340
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:53,924
Don't worry.

341
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:56,126
The North remembers.

342
00:30:57,512 --> 00:30:59,629
I punished him for it.

343
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,048
He's not ironborn anymore.

344
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:05,302
Not Theon Greyjoy anymore.

345
00:31:05,304 --> 00:31:07,137
He's a new man.

346
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:11,608
A new person, anyway.

347
00:31:11,642 --> 00:31:13,310
Aren't you, Reek?

348
00:31:13,312 --> 00:31:14,978
Yes, master.

349
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:17,197
That's his
new name-- Reek.

350
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:19,316
Why are you doing this?

351
00:31:21,235 --> 00:31:24,454
Because Reek has
something to say to you.

352
00:31:24,488 --> 00:31:26,089
Don't you, Reek?

353
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,001
An apology.

354
00:31:43,808 --> 00:31:46,977
Apologize to Lady Sansa
for what you did.

355
00:31:48,312 --> 00:31:51,314
Apologize for murdering
her two brothers.

356
00:31:57,188 --> 00:31:58,772
I'm sorry.

357
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:02,325
Look at her, Reek.

358
00:32:03,494 --> 00:32:05,195
<i>An apology doesn't mean anything</i>

359
00:32:05,197 --> 00:32:07,797
<i>if you're not looking</i>
<i>the person in the eye.</i>

360
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:16,873
- I'm sorry.
<i>- Sorry about what?</i>

361
00:32:18,092 --> 00:32:19,876
For killing your brothers.

362
00:32:30,438 --> 00:32:33,306
There, over and done with.

363
00:32:33,357 --> 00:32:36,860
<i>Doesn't everyone</i>
<i>feel better? I do.</i>

364
00:32:36,894 --> 00:32:39,813
That was getting very tense.

365
00:32:40,698 --> 00:32:42,399
Whew.

366
00:32:45,236 --> 00:32:48,371
You know what, my lady?

367
00:32:48,406 --> 00:32:51,241
What with him having
murdered your brothers

368
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:53,743
and the rest
of your family gone...

369
00:32:55,796 --> 00:32:59,966
Reek here is the nearest
thing to living kin

370
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:02,002
that you have left.

371
00:33:03,337 --> 00:33:05,305
Reek.

372
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:07,223
You will give away the bride.

373
00:33:09,927 --> 00:33:13,563
Someone has to.
What better person?

374
00:33:13,597 --> 00:33:15,065
Good? Good?

375
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:18,485
Yes, yes, very good.

376
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:20,520
Wonderful.

377
00:33:22,047 --> 00:33:24,941
Walda and I have
some good news as well,

378
00:33:24,943 --> 00:33:26,743
since we're all together.

379
00:33:32,116 --> 00:33:34,277
We're going to have a baby.

380
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,675
I'm very happy for you.

381
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:43,677
From the way she's carrying,

382
00:33:43,711 --> 00:33:46,596
Maester Wolkan says
it looks like a boy.

383
00:34:01,979 --> 00:34:03,697
<i>How can you be sure?</i>

384
00:34:03,731 --> 00:34:05,949
Sure of what?

385
00:34:05,983 --> 00:34:07,884
That she's pregnant.

386
00:34:07,918 --> 00:34:09,953
I mean...

387
00:34:09,987 --> 00:34:11,654
how can you tell?

388
00:34:11,656 --> 00:34:15,016
Maester Wolkan has assured
us beyond all doubt.

389
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:26,586
So how did you manage it?

390
00:34:26,637 --> 00:34:28,471
Manage what?

391
00:34:28,506 --> 00:34:30,840
Getting her pregnant.

392
00:34:30,891 --> 00:34:32,942
I imagine you're familiar
with the procedure.

393
00:34:32,977 --> 00:34:36,062
Of course, but how did you...

394
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:37,102
find it?

395
00:34:37,222 --> 00:34:39,983
You disgraced yourself at dinner

396
00:34:40,017 --> 00:34:42,352
parading that creature
before the Stark girl.

397
00:34:42,403 --> 00:34:44,988
And if it's a boy?

398
00:34:47,191 --> 00:34:48,858
You're worried about
your position.

399
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:50,994
My position is quite clear.

400
00:34:51,028 --> 00:34:53,830
I'm your son

401
00:34:53,864 --> 00:34:56,366
until a better
alternative comes along.

402
00:35:05,626 --> 00:35:07,794
You've never asked me
about your mother.

403
00:35:12,299 --> 00:35:14,717
Why would I?

404
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:17,554
She had me, she died.

405
00:35:18,722 --> 00:35:21,409
And here we are.

406
00:35:21,529 --> 00:35:23,766
She was a peasant girl.

407
00:35:24,175 --> 00:35:26,602
Pretty in a common sort of way.

408
00:35:26,604 --> 00:35:28,845
She was the miller's wife.

409
00:35:28,965 --> 00:35:32,322
Apparently they had married
without my knowledge or consent.

410
00:35:32,596 --> 00:35:34,304
So I had him hanged

411
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:37,863
and I took her beneath the
tree where he was swaying.

412
00:35:37,914 --> 00:35:39,373
She fought me the whole time.

413
00:35:39,493 --> 00:35:42,167
She was lucky
I didn't hang her, too.

414
00:35:42,202 --> 00:35:44,364
<i>A year later</i>
<i>she came to my gates</i>

415
00:35:44,484 --> 00:35:46,346
<i>with a squalling baby</i>
<i>in her arms.</i>

416
00:35:46,466 --> 00:35:49,041
<i>A baby she claimed was mine.</i>

417
00:35:49,092 --> 00:35:50,685
I nearly had her whipped

418
00:35:50,805 --> 00:35:53,212
and the child
thrown in the river.

419
00:35:58,261 --> 00:36:00,102
But then I looked at you

420
00:36:00,136 --> 00:36:03,072
<i>and I saw then what I see now.</i>

421
00:36:03,106 --> 00:36:05,307
You are my son.

422
00:36:17,155 --> 00:36:20,141
Stannis Baratheon has
an army at Castle Black.

423
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:23,384
But he won't stay for long.

424
00:36:23,386 --> 00:36:26,053
He wants the Iron Throne,

425
00:36:26,055 --> 00:36:29,546
and the road to King's Landing
comes right through Winterfell.

426
00:36:30,552 --> 00:36:33,583
He means to take the North.

427
00:36:35,252 --> 00:36:37,470
But the North is ours.

428
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:39,639
It's yours and mine.

429
00:36:40,641 --> 00:36:43,259
Will you help me defeat him?

430
00:36:44,762 --> 00:36:46,596
Yes.

431
00:36:54,322 --> 00:36:56,773
Is this every book there is?

432
00:36:57,942 --> 00:36:59,693
Every book there is?

433
00:37:00,828 --> 00:37:03,913
- In the world.
- Well, no.

434
00:37:03,948 --> 00:37:07,951
There are thousands and
thousands of books out there.

435
00:37:07,953 --> 00:37:10,203
This library is rather
small, actually.

436
00:37:10,254 --> 00:37:11,921
Where you grew up,
were there more books?

437
00:37:11,956 --> 00:37:14,791
My father's not
the most literate man.

438
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:20,797
They say the Citadel has the
largest library in the world.

439
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:22,265
Where's that?

440
00:37:23,434 --> 00:37:25,952
The Citadel?

441
00:37:25,986 --> 00:37:27,721
In Oldtown.

442
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,829
I'm sorry I don't know things.

443
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:39,034
Gilly, look at me.

444
00:37:39,069 --> 00:37:42,988
<i>You know how to do a hundred
things I can never do.</i>

445
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:45,291
You can build a fire
with wet wood.

446
00:37:45,325 --> 00:37:47,743
You can cook.
You can stitch a wound.

447
00:37:47,794 --> 00:37:50,496
I can wash the linens.
I can sweep the floor.

448
00:37:50,547 --> 00:37:53,883
- Well... - Why does the Citadel have
the biggest library?

449
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:57,052
<i>It's where they train</i>
<i>the maesters.</i>

450
00:37:57,087 --> 00:37:58,621
Like Maester Aemon?

451
00:37:58,655 --> 00:38:01,423
I wanted to be one
when I was young.

452
00:38:03,977 --> 00:38:08,230
Instead, I became a man
of the Night's Watch.

453
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:13,636
Far more adventure
up here anyway.

454
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:17,323
I wouldn't have met you.

455
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:25,114
Ah, Your Grace.

456
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:34,790
You're Samwell Tarly?

457
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:37,893
I am, Your Grace.

458
00:38:37,928 --> 00:38:40,212
Your father is Randyll Tarly.

459
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:45,801
He defeated my brother
at the Battle of Ashford.

460
00:38:47,053 --> 00:38:50,022
<i>Only battle Robert ever lost.</i>

461
00:38:50,056 --> 00:38:53,642
I told him he shouldn't go so far
west so soon, but he never listened.

462
00:38:55,999 --> 00:38:58,864
<i>Fine soldier, your father.</i>

463
00:38:58,898 --> 00:39:00,983
You don't look like a soldier.

464
00:39:02,202 --> 00:39:04,987
But I'm told you killed
a white walker.

465
00:39:04,989 --> 00:39:06,822
I did, Your Grace.

466
00:39:06,873 --> 00:39:08,123
<i>How?</i>

467
00:39:08,158 --> 00:39:10,292
With a dagger
made of dragonglass.

468
00:39:10,327 --> 00:39:11,320
Dragonglass?

469
00:39:11,544 --> 00:39:13,162
What the maesters call obsidian.

470
00:39:13,213 --> 00:39:15,497
I know what it is.
We have it in Dragonstone.

471
00:39:15,548 --> 00:39:17,112
Why would obsidian
kill a walker?

472
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:19,251
I don't know.

473
00:39:19,302 --> 00:39:21,143
I've been going through
all the old manuscripts

474
00:39:21,171 --> 00:39:23,422
hoping to find something,
and all I've learned

475
00:39:23,473 --> 00:39:26,377
is that the children of the forest
used to hunt with dragonglass.

476
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:30,646
The Lady Melisandre told me
that death marches on the Wall.

477
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,209
I've seen it, Your Grace.

478
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:37,186
Seen what?

479
00:39:37,188 --> 00:39:40,089
The army of the dead.

480
00:39:40,123 --> 00:39:43,792
- And when they come--
- We have to know how to fight them.

481
00:39:47,564 --> 00:39:50,115
Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.

482
00:40:07,467 --> 00:40:09,268
It's time.

483
00:40:09,302 --> 00:40:11,553
Uh, Your Grace.

484
00:40:11,604 --> 00:40:14,106
Wouldn't it be better to wait?

485
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,987
When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings,
we could have thousands more men.

486
00:40:17,058 --> 00:40:18,578
If Jon Snow returns
with the wildlings.

487
00:40:18,591 --> 00:40:20,275
We can't wait that long.

488
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:23,896
We have the advantage-- more men,
more horses, all fed and rested.

489
00:40:23,898 --> 00:40:26,899
<i>But every day we wait, the
odds shift in Bolton's favor.</i>

490
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,034
This could turn to winter
at any moment.

491
00:40:29,069 --> 00:40:30,869
We have to act now.
Give the order.

492
00:40:30,904 --> 00:40:32,404
We march at sunrise.

493
00:40:32,406 --> 00:40:34,156
I'll choose a dozen men to stay

494
00:40:34,207 --> 00:40:36,625
and guard the queen
and the princess.

495
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:38,539
No need.
They're coming with us.

496
00:40:40,246 --> 00:40:42,247
It's a tough road ahead,
Your Grace.

497
00:40:42,298 --> 00:40:45,050
- Won't they be safer--
- Here?

498
00:40:45,085 --> 00:40:48,754
Half these watchmen
are killers and rapists.

499
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:51,724
No, they march with us.

500
00:40:54,894 --> 00:40:56,895
As you wish, Your Grace.

501
00:41:22,422 --> 00:41:25,124
<i>Do you think Father will
let me go down into the crypt?</i>

502
00:41:25,126 --> 00:41:26,766
Beg your pardon?

503
00:41:26,793 --> 00:41:28,544
At Winterfell.

504
00:41:28,595 --> 00:41:30,629
All the Kings in the North
are buried there.

505
00:41:30,631 --> 00:41:32,464
Bran the Builder
and King Dorren and--

506
00:41:32,466 --> 00:41:34,850
First things first.
It's a long march ahead.

507
00:41:34,884 --> 00:41:36,852
And then we have
to take the castle.

508
00:41:36,886 --> 00:41:38,303
Is there going to be a battle?

509
00:41:38,354 --> 00:41:40,806
Aye, princess, but you
won't be anywhere near--

510
00:41:40,857 --> 00:41:44,059
That's enough talk
of battle, Ser Davos.

511
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,527
You'll scare the child.

512
00:41:45,562 --> 00:41:47,980
<i>Yes, my queen.</i>

513
00:41:50,366 --> 00:41:53,318
- I'm not scared.
- Well, I am.

514
00:41:53,403 --> 00:41:56,321
When the battle comes,
promise you'll protect me.

515
00:41:56,406 --> 00:41:58,457
I promise.

516
00:42:18,261 --> 00:42:21,680
I hope you know what you're
doing with these wildlings.

517
00:42:21,731 --> 00:42:24,099
I need those ships.

518
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:28,320
You'll get them back,
I swear it.

519
00:42:29,856 --> 00:42:32,191
Have a safe journey, Your Grace.

520
00:42:33,193 --> 00:42:35,027
And thank you.

521
00:43:03,857 --> 00:43:05,691
<i>Mount up!</i>

522
00:43:05,725 --> 00:43:07,726
<i>Colors!</i>

523
00:43:57,277 --> 00:43:59,278
No.

524
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,246
You're still too weak.

525
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:05,784
_

526
00:44:06,479 --> 00:44:07,850
_

527
00:44:12,258 --> 00:44:13,759
Ser Barristan?

528
00:44:19,677 --> 00:44:20,873
_

529
00:44:24,923 --> 00:44:26,730
_

530
00:44:27,776 --> 00:44:29,446
_

531
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:31,173
_

532
00:44:31,983 --> 00:44:33,628
_

533
00:44:35,248 --> 00:44:37,129
_

534
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:41,787
<i>Are you ashamed?</i>

535
00:44:43,323 --> 00:44:45,824
<i>You were ambushed, outnumbered.</i>

536
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:47,793
<i>There was no way</i>
<i>you could have known.</i>

537
00:44:47,827 --> 00:44:49,878
This is not why.

538
00:44:52,332 --> 00:44:54,549
Wounded in war,

539
00:44:54,584 --> 00:44:57,919
there is no shame for this.

540
00:44:57,971 --> 00:45:00,088
I am ashamed

541
00:45:00,139 --> 00:45:02,674
because when the knife go in

542
00:45:02,725 --> 00:45:06,061
and I fall to the ground,

543
00:45:06,095 --> 00:45:08,013
I am afraid.

544
00:45:09,565 --> 00:45:11,650
All men fear death.

545
00:45:11,684 --> 00:45:14,469
No, not death.

546
00:45:17,023 --> 00:45:19,691
I fear

547
00:45:19,742 --> 00:45:24,656
I never again see Missandei
from the Island of Naath.

548
00:46:00,616 --> 00:46:03,785
Now you have given the
Masters what they deserve.

549
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,370
If I give everyone
what they deserve,

550
00:46:05,405 --> 00:46:07,572
I'll have no one left to rule.

551
00:46:07,574 --> 00:46:10,125
Ser Barristan counseled mercy

552
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:12,840
when I took this city right
up to the morning he died.

553
00:46:12,879 --> 00:46:15,664
<i>Daario Naharis thinks I should
kill the former Masters</i>

554
00:46:15,715 --> 00:46:18,876
<i>and let the rest of the
city fend for itself.</i>

555
00:46:19,335 --> 00:46:21,086
What do you think?

556
00:46:22,555 --> 00:46:24,673
Your Grace, I think
that I am not fit

557
00:46:24,724 --> 00:46:27,092
to have an opinion
on these matters.

558
00:46:27,143 --> 00:46:29,594
You are as fit as anyone I know.

559
00:46:31,013 --> 00:46:33,265
You know why I'm here.

560
00:46:33,267 --> 00:46:36,351
And you know who will suffer the
most if this all falls apart.

561
00:46:36,402 --> 00:46:39,571
<i>So what do you think?</i>

562
00:46:41,774 --> 00:46:45,277
I can only tell you
what I have seen, Your Grace.

563
00:46:45,328 --> 00:46:48,613
I have seen you listen
to your counselors.

564
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:53,952
I have seen you lean on their
experience when your own was lacking

565
00:46:54,003 --> 00:46:57,055
and weigh the choices
they put before you.

566
00:46:58,758 --> 00:47:01,760
And I have seen you
ignore your counselors...

567
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:07,132
because there was
a better choice.

568
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:09,518
One that only you could see.

569
00:47:26,235 --> 00:47:29,488
My-- my queen,
please do not do this.

570
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,490
<i>What about "valar morghulis"?</i>

571
00:47:31,492 --> 00:47:34,075
I did not want to die a coward.

572
00:47:38,831 --> 00:47:41,466
Apparently I do not
want to die at all.

573
00:47:43,336 --> 00:47:45,804
It takes courage to admit fear.

574
00:47:47,173 --> 00:47:49,508
And to admit a mistake.

575
00:47:50,977 --> 00:47:53,595
I came here to tell you
that I was wrong.

576
00:47:56,482 --> 00:47:59,100
I was wrong and you were right.

577
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:03,188
About tradition.

578
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,442
About bringing the people
of this city together.

579
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:13,031
I will reopen the fighting pits.

580
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,584
To free men only.

581
00:48:15,618 --> 00:48:19,838
Slavery will never return to
Meereen, not while I live.

582
00:48:19,872 --> 00:48:21,957
Yes, my queen.

583
00:48:25,344 --> 00:48:29,297
And in order to forge a lasting
bond with the Meereenese people,

584
00:48:29,348 --> 00:48:32,133
I will marry the leader
of an ancient family.

585
00:48:34,387 --> 00:48:37,389
Thankfully a suitor
is already on his knees.

586
00:49:05,551 --> 00:49:07,335
Don't worry.

587
00:49:07,386 --> 00:49:10,839
I'll be fine. Nothing
broken, I don't think.

588
00:49:13,009 --> 00:49:14,809
Where are we now?

589
00:49:14,844 --> 00:49:16,928
Not the Rhoyne.

590
00:49:22,985 --> 00:49:25,654
Long, sullen silences

591
00:49:25,688 --> 00:49:28,690
and an occasional
punch in the face.

592
00:49:30,493 --> 00:49:32,611
The Mormont way.

593
00:49:36,082 --> 00:49:38,833
Let's start over.

594
00:49:40,036 --> 00:49:42,454
I apologize for before.

595
00:49:42,456 --> 00:49:45,457
<i>My mouth sometimes</i>
<i>runs away from me.</i>

596
00:49:45,508 --> 00:49:48,426
This doesn't have to be
an unpleasant trip.

597
00:49:53,215 --> 00:49:56,376
We're going to be spending a lot of
time together on the way to Meereen.

598
00:49:56,385 --> 00:49:57,769
We are.

599
00:49:59,605 --> 00:50:02,941
What would make our time
together truly enjoyable

600
00:50:02,975 --> 00:50:04,476
would be some wine.

601
00:50:05,311 --> 00:50:06,811
No wine.

602
00:50:09,482 --> 00:50:12,984
I am a person who drinks.

603
00:50:14,654 --> 00:50:16,988
People who drink
need to keep drinking.

604
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:19,074
<i>Otherwise, they're not...</i>

605
00:50:26,499 --> 00:50:27,999
I know where we are.

606
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:30,552
You're taking us
through Valyria.

607
00:50:30,586 --> 00:50:31,970
I am.

608
00:50:32,004 --> 00:50:34,172
Have you sailed
this route before?

609
00:50:34,223 --> 00:50:35,757
No.

610
00:50:35,808 --> 00:50:37,759
You're going to bring
Daenerys a souvenir

611
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:40,011
from her ancestral homeland
in case I'm not enough?

612
00:50:40,013 --> 00:50:42,597
I think you'll be plenty.

613
00:50:43,733 --> 00:50:45,817
<i>You know what they say.</i>

614
00:50:45,851 --> 00:50:49,070
The Doom still rules Valyria.

615
00:50:49,105 --> 00:50:52,023
What about the demons
and the flames?

616
00:50:53,192 --> 00:50:54,909
<i>Aren't you afraid of the Doom?</i>

617
00:50:54,944 --> 00:50:56,745
<i>No.</i>

618
00:50:56,779 --> 00:50:59,197
But pirates are.

619
00:51:00,082 --> 00:51:01,700
Oh.

620
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:08,173
The Smoking Sea.

621
00:51:08,207 --> 00:51:10,175
How many centuries
before we learn

622
00:51:10,209 --> 00:51:12,593
how to build cities
like this again?

623
00:51:13,828 --> 00:51:16,630
Thousands of years the Valyrians were

624
00:51:16,664 --> 00:51:19,473
the best in the world
at almost everything.

625
00:51:19,971 --> 00:51:22,469
And then...

626
00:51:22,503 --> 00:51:25,255
And then they weren't.

627
00:51:25,306 --> 00:51:26,923
And then they weren't.

628
00:51:30,178 --> 00:51:34,347
"They held each other close and
turned their backs upon the end.

629
00:51:34,399 --> 00:51:37,401
<i>The hills that split asunder</i>

630
00:51:37,435 --> 00:51:40,237
and the black
that ate the skies;

631
00:51:40,271 --> 00:51:41,968
The flames that shot
so high and hot

632
00:51:42,088 --> 00:51:44,191
that even dragons burned;

633
00:51:44,242 --> 00:51:46,018
Would never be the final sights

634
00:51:46,138 --> 00:51:48,779
that fell upon their eyes.

635
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:50,931
A fly upon a wall,

636
00:51:51,517 --> 00:51:55,487
the waves the sea wind
whipped and churned--"

637
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:58,440
"The city of a thousand years,

638
00:51:58,442 --> 00:52:00,358
and all that men had learned;

639
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:03,862
The Doom consumed it all alike,

640
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:06,614
and neither
of them turned."

641
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:11,703
I would clap.

642
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:19,127
I suppose this is it, then.

643
00:52:20,296 --> 00:52:22,430
This is what remains.

644
00:53:02,087 --> 00:53:03,338
What was that?

645
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,263
Stone Men!

646
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,215
Don't let them touch you!

647
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:32,200
Get behind!

648
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:37,172
Mormont, cut me free!

649
00:53:37,206 --> 00:53:39,374
Mormont!

650
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:56,057
Mormont!

651
00:53:56,059 --> 00:53:58,193
Mormont!

652
00:54:33,745 --> 00:54:35,796
Tyrion?

653
00:54:38,633 --> 00:54:41,135
Tyrion.

654
00:54:41,169 --> 00:54:42,837
Tyrion.

655
00:54:44,256 --> 00:54:46,257
Tyrion.

656
00:54:47,182 --> 00:54:49,560
You're all right.

657
00:54:59,104 --> 00:55:01,439
You're heavier than you look.

658
00:55:03,942 --> 00:55:06,277
Did any of them touch you?

659
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:10,948
You?

660
00:55:15,921 --> 00:55:18,839
I've seen greyscale before,

661
00:55:18,874 --> 00:55:20,341
but nothing like that.

662
00:55:20,375 --> 00:55:23,294
I suppose that's why
they send them there.

663
00:55:25,297 --> 00:55:28,817
It'd be kinder to put daggers in
their hearts and be done with it.

664
00:55:32,721 --> 00:55:35,973
Thank you for saving me.

665
00:55:39,311 --> 00:55:41,479
Of course, I wouldn't
have needed saving

666
00:55:41,481 --> 00:55:43,762
if you hadn't kidnapped me
in the first place.

667
00:55:47,851 --> 00:55:49,670
So what now?

668
00:55:49,777 --> 00:55:51,861
We walk up the coast.

669
00:55:51,912 --> 00:55:53,747
With luck, we'll find
a fishing village.

670
00:55:53,781 --> 00:55:55,782
Maybe another boat.

671
00:55:55,784 --> 00:55:58,068
Without luck?

672
00:55:58,102 --> 00:56:00,787
We've got a long walk
ahead of us.

673
00:56:02,707 --> 00:56:05,842
I'll get some wood for a fire.

674
00:56:05,876 --> 00:56:08,628
Try to get some rest, huh?

675
00:56:08,679 --> 00:56:11,414
That's the best idea
you've had all day.

676
