Brother?

Did you send the ravens?

4
00:02:29,546 --> 00:02:33,683
Tarly, look at me.

5
00:02:35,786 --> 00:02:38,354
Did you send the ravens?

<i>That was your job.</i>

7
00:02:43,927 --> 00:02:46,696
Your only job.

8
00:02:54,204 --> 00:02:57,874
We need to get
back to the Wall.

<i>We know what's out there,</i>

11
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,116

have to warn them

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,986
or before winter's done,

13
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,188
everyone you've ever known

14
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:14,023

First time you've seen

Well, don't stare too long.
They're shy.

When they stop being shy,
they get angry.

And when they're angry,

36
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,932

<i>Got no respect, this lot.</i>

What happened
to their fathers?

40
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:27,412
Some of them were killed
by crows like you.

41
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:31,883
Don't look so grim,
Jon Snow.

42
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:34,953
If Mance Rayder likes you,
you'll live another day.

43
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,856
And if he don't...

44
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,080
I smell a crow.

45
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:04,315
We killed his friends.

46
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,151
Thought you'd want
to question this one.

47
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,288
What do we want
with a baby crow?

48
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,258
This baby killed
Qhorin Halfhand.

49
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:15,494
<i>He wants to be</i>
<i>one of us.</i>

50
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,203
That half-handed cunt
killed friends of mine.

51
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,639
Friends twice your size.

52
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:32,211
My father told me big men fall
just as quick as little ones

53
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:35,715
<i>if you put a sword</i>
<i>through their hearts.</i>

54
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,584
Plenty of little men

55
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,554
tried to put their swords
through my heart.

56
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:44,356
And there's plenty
of little skeletons

57
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,058
<i>buried in the woods.</i>

58
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:51,130
- <i>What's your name, boy?</i>
- Jon Snow.

59
00:08:57,071 --> 00:08:59,339
Your Grace.

60
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:04,077
Your Grace?

61
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,779
Did you hear that?

62
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:08,882
From now on, you'd better
kneel every time I fart.

63
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:12,318
Stand, boy.

64
00:09:14,455 --> 00:09:17,457
We don't kneel for anyone
beyond the Wall.

65
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:25,332
So, you're
Ned Stark's bastard.

66
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:27,500
Thank you for the gift,
Lord of Bones.

67
00:09:27,535 --> 00:09:30,204
You can leave us.

68
00:09:38,713 --> 00:09:40,514
The girl likes you.

69
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:42,716
You like her back, Snow?

70
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:45,119
That why you want
to join us?

71
00:09:45,153 --> 00:09:46,921
<i>Don't panic, boy.</i>

72
00:09:46,956 --> 00:09:49,157
This isn't the damned
Night's Watch

73
00:09:49,192 --> 00:09:51,393
where we make you
swear off girls.

74
00:09:51,427 --> 00:09:55,096
This chicken eater you thought
was king is Tormund Giantsbane.

75
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:57,566
Can't believe this pup

76
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,901
<i>killed the Halfhand.</i>

77
00:09:59,935 --> 00:10:02,136
He was our enemy

78
00:10:02,171 --> 00:10:05,039
and I'm glad he's dead.

79
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:17,517
He was my brother once.

80
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:20,220
Back when he had
a whole hand.

81
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,757
What were you
doing with him?

82
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,094
The Lord Commander sent me
to the Halfhand for seasoning.

83
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:28,962
Why?

84
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:30,764
He wants me to lead
one day.

85
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:34,268
But here you are,
a traitor

86
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:36,770
kneeling before
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

87
00:10:36,838 --> 00:10:40,374
If I'm a traitor,
then you are, too.

88
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:50,985
Why do you want
to join us, Jon Snow?

89
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,926
I want to be free.

90
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,096
No, I don't think so.

91
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:05,299
I think what you want
most of all

92
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,534
is to be a hero.

93
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:11,472
I'll ask you
one last time--

94
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:14,541
why do you want
to join us?

95
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,582
We stopped at Craster's
Keep on the way north.

96
00:11:24,052 --> 00:11:26,486
I saw...

97
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,087
You saw what?

98
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:32,458
I saw Craster take
his own baby boy

99
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:35,227
and leave it
in the woods.

100
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,529
I saw what took it.

101
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:45,171
You're telling me
you saw one of them?

102
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:50,511
And why would that make you
desert your brothers?

103
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:53,614
Because when I told
the Lord Commander,

104
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:55,649
he already knew.

105
00:11:57,618 --> 00:12:00,254
Thousands of years ago,
the First Men

106
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:03,624
battled the White Walkers
and defeated them.

107
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:07,628
I want to fight for the side
that fights for the living.

108
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:12,900
Did I come
to the right place?

109
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:20,440
We'll need to find you
a new cloak.

110
00:12:41,563 --> 00:12:43,764
What if you took off
that bit there?

111
00:12:45,901 --> 00:12:49,503
Don't you want to leave
something to the imagination?

112
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:53,439
Trouble is, I've never
had much imagination.

113
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,611
I want you to take it off.

114
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,785
Mouth.

115
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:15,559
Ser Bronn.
Ser Bronn.

116
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:19,430
I didn't hear that.

117
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:21,465
- Apologies, ser.
<i>- Back away.</i>

118
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:24,435
Keep backing away till you're
outside this establishment.

119
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:28,105
- Then back away some more.
- Lord Tyrion sent me.

120
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:31,108
I will murder you, boy.

121
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:33,610
He said it was a matter
of life and death.

122
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:53,628
- Pod?
<i>- It's your sister.</i>

123
00:13:54,898 --> 00:13:57,233
<i>The queen.</i>

124
00:14:10,014 --> 00:14:11,282
<i>What are they doing here?</i>

125
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:14,485
Protecting me, I assume.
Will you let me in?

126
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:17,354
No, I don't think so.

127
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,090
If I wanted to kill you,
do you think

128
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,792
I'd let a wooden door
stop me?

129
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,300
They stay outside.

130
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,569
I'm not afraid of you,
little brother.

131
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,987
- Why are you here?
- I wanted to see your face.

132
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,592
They said you'd lost your nose, but
it's not as gruesome as all that.

133
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,062
The man who cut me
lost more than his nose.

134
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,465
I should hope so.

135
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,801
The rebels came for Joffrey's
head, they lost their own.

136
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,903
Thanks to Father.

137
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:07,406
Thanks to Father.

138
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,010
Of course, it wasn't a rebel
who tried to kill me.

139
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:13,579
No? Curious.

140
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:17,416
Bit of a comedown
from chamber of the Hand.

141
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,652
But then I don't suppose
you need much room.

142
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:22,655
Grand Maester Pycelle
made the same joke.

143
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,992
You must be proud to be as funny as
a man whose balls brush his knees.

144
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,793
You're meeting
Father today?

145
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:29,896
How do you know that?

146
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,766
<i>Because I have hundreds</i>
<i>of spies in my employ.</i>

147
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,302
The Master of Whisperers
owes me a favor or two.

148
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:40,940
Father told me.
What do you want from him?

149
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:42,608
What do I want from him?
He's my father.

150
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:45,144
Do I need
to want something?

151
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,814
I'm sure
he loves me dearly,

152
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:51,549
as any father loves
his child,

153
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:54,252
his baby boy.

154
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,354
Yet he hasn't come
to visit once

155
00:15:56,421 --> 00:15:58,022
<i>since arriving</i>
<i>in King's Landing.</i>

156
00:15:58,056 --> 00:16:01,158
<i>I lay here,</i>
<i>my face split in half,</i>

157
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,728
but Father never came.

158
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,301
You're going
to make me cry.

159
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:13,703
Why do you care
what I want from him?

160
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:17,207
Because you've slandered me
to Father before.

161
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:19,475
Slandered?
When?

162
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:21,744
<i>You told him</i>
<i>I had my guards</i>

163
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:23,645
beat that servant girl
at Casterly Rock.

164
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,514
<i>You did have</i>
<i>your guards beat her.</i>

165
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:26,782
A girl of nine,
I believe.

166
00:16:26,816 --> 00:16:28,617
<i>I was nine, too.</i>

167
00:16:28,651 --> 00:16:30,685
She lost an eye,
if I remember correctly.

168
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,120
If I remember correctly,

169
00:16:32,154 --> 00:16:34,389
she never stole
a necklace again.

170
00:16:36,092 --> 00:16:38,994
It's not slander
if it's true.

171
00:16:39,028 --> 00:16:41,730
And what's this truth
you plan on telling him today?

172
00:16:41,764 --> 00:16:43,498
<i>Why are you so nervous</i>

173
00:16:43,532 --> 00:16:45,767
<i>about what I'm going</i>
<i>to say to Father?</i>

174
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:47,869
Because you're a liar.

175
00:16:47,904 --> 00:16:50,973
I expect you'll tell lies
about me, about Joffrey.

176
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:53,476
Any lies in particular?

177
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:57,647
You're a clever man,

178
00:16:57,682 --> 00:16:59,950
but you're not half as clever
as you think you are.

179
00:16:59,984 --> 00:17:03,020
Still makes me
more clever than you.

180
00:17:06,524 --> 00:17:09,827
Oh, look at these two
shining warriors.

181
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:13,330
Ser Taryn Mant and...

182
00:17:13,364 --> 00:17:15,099
Ser Whosit of Whocares.

183
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:16,500
Ser Meryn Trant.

184
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,070
Ser Bronn
of the Blackwater.

185
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,706
- You're no knight.
- Pod.

186
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,174
Ser Bronn
of the Blackwater

187
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,109
was anointed
by the king himself.

188
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,845
You're an up-jumped
cutthroat,

189
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,481
nothing more.

190
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,450
That's exactly who I am.

191
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,251
And you're a grub
in fancy armor

192
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:36,555
<i>who's better at beating little
girls than fighting men.</i>

193
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,358
Now, I have an appointment
with Lord Tyrion.

194
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:42,228
You put your hand
on that door,

195
00:17:42,263 --> 00:17:44,864
you lose the hand.

196
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:03,382
As much as I appreciate a walk
in the sunshine, your lordship,

197
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,551
I am wondering
why you sent for me.

198
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,686
A number of people
in this city want to kill me.

199
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,020
You're here to protect me.

200
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,256
I've been doing that
for a while now.

201
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,058
Do you grow bored
protecting me?

202
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,559
I grow poor
protecting you.

203
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,494
Poor?
Poor?

204
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,596
Under my patronage
you've become a knight,

205
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,698
you've served as Commander
of the City Watch.

206
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,468
- Briefly.
- I'm sure you filled your pockets.

207
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,570
And now my pockets
are empty.

208
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,939
You've given me a taste
for the finer things.

209
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,975
And if you want me
to carry on protecting you,

210
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,343
you'll need to pay more.

211
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,845
- I thought we were friends.
- We are.

212
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,648
But I'm a sellsword.
I sell my sword.

213
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,449
I don't loan it out
to friends as a favor.

214
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,917
- How much?
- Double.

215
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,119
- Double?
- I'm a knight now.

216
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,587
Knights
are worth double.

217
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,990
I don't even know how much
I'm paying you now.

218
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,092
Which means
you can afford it.

219
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:28,664
Here. Here!

220
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,476
Help me!

221
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:03,435
Who are you?

222
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:10,176
I was in the battle
at Blackwater.

223
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:15,215
I was a captain
and a knight.

224
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:19,119
Aye, ser,
and serving which king?

225
00:20:24,693 --> 00:20:27,462
The one true king
of Westeros--

226
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:32,166
Stannis Baratheon.

227
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:43,343
I thought you were dead.

228
00:20:43,378 --> 00:20:46,012
Everyone thought
you were dead.

229
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:51,584
And your son?

230
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:59,759
He may have swam
ashore as you did.

231
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:02,829
No, the wildfire took him.
I saw it.

232
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:15,574
I'm so sorry,
my friend.

233
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,144
I, too, have lost a son.

234
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:20,546
There is nothing worse
in this world.

235
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:25,450
But, Davos, you were
a good father.

236
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:29,020
If I was a good father,
he'd still be here.

237
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,624
Stannis lives?

238
00:21:33,658 --> 00:21:35,860
He licks his wounds
at Dragonstone.

239
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,661
Will you take me there?

240
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:40,097
There is nothing for me
at Dragonstone.

241
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,598
This war is not over.

242
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,966
Not for you, maybe.

243
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,736
But for Salladhor Saan,
the war is over.

244
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,771
We're both sworn
to King Stannis.

245
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:50,274
I am sworn to no man.

246
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:54,111
I promised you 30 ships and you
promised me riches and glory.

247
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:55,646
I delivered the ships.

248
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,849
Stannis never gives up.
Never.

249
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,285
- Now he will regroup--
- <i>He's a broken man.</i>

250
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,788
His fleet lies at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.

251
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,457
They say he sees no one--

252
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,726
not his generals,
not even his wife.

253
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,763
Only the Red Woman

254
00:22:09,797 --> 00:22:11,164
whispering in his ear,

255
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:14,033
telling him what
she sees in the flames

256
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:15,702
and burning men alive.

257
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:17,170
What?

258
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:20,707
They built a great fire
when Stannis returned.

259
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:23,643
All those who spoke
against her she called

260
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:26,279
servants of darkness.

261
00:22:28,248 --> 00:22:30,783
They say she sang
to them as they burned.

262
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:37,090
I'm a pirate.

263
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:39,425
<i>You're a smuggler.</i>

264
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,127
<i>Servants of darkness.</i>

265
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:44,430
I'm thinking Dragonstone is a
good place for us to avoid.

266
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:46,731
Take me back there, please.

267
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,666
You cannot turn
Stannis against her.

268
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,335
Maybe not, but I could
carve her heart out.

269
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,970
You could try.

270
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:55,373
If you fail,
they will burn you.

271
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:58,276
If you succeed,
they'll burn you.

272
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,445
And you've only
just come back to life.

273
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,714
Stay alive a little
longer, my friend.

274
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,483
You call me friend. You drank
with me on my wedding day.

275
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,985
And you drank with me
on four of my wedding days,

276
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,921
but I don't ask you
for favors.

277
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,556
I have to stop her.

278
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,726
Please, do this for me.

279
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,932
When you are dead,

280
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:22,401
I will gather your bones
in a little sack

281
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:25,538
and let your widow
wear them around her neck.

282
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:41,754
We should set the siege lines
1,000 yards from Harrenhal.

283
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:44,557
There won't be a siege. The
Mountain can't defend a ruin.

284
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,092
I imagine the Mountain
will defend

285
00:23:46,126 --> 00:23:47,993
whatever Tywin Lannister
tells him to defend.

286
00:23:48,028 --> 00:23:50,196
The Lannisters have been
running from us since Oxcross.

287
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,932
I'd love a fight.
The men would love a fight.

288
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:55,769
I don't think
we're going to get one.

289
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,090
200 Northmen
slaughtered like sheep.

290
00:24:48,158 --> 00:24:51,161
The debt will be
repaid, my friend.

291
00:24:51,195 --> 00:24:53,997
For them
and for your sons.

292
00:24:54,031 --> 00:24:56,199
Will it?

293
00:24:56,266 --> 00:24:58,567
They rot in the ground

294
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:00,803
<i>while their killer</i>
<i>runs free.</i>

295
00:25:00,837 --> 00:25:03,772
The Kingslayer won't
remain free for long.

296
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:06,642
My best hunters
are after him.

297
00:25:25,328 --> 00:25:29,298
<i>- A Mallister?</i>
- Ser Jeremy.

298
00:25:29,332 --> 00:25:31,867
My father's bannerman.

299
00:25:52,156 --> 00:25:55,091
Find her a chamber
that will serve as a cell.

300
00:26:07,437 --> 00:26:08,805
<i>She's your mother.</i>

301
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:11,474
She freed
Jaime Lannister.

302
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:13,877
The Lannisters robbed
them of their sons

303
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:15,679
and she robbed them
of their justice.

304
00:26:17,748 --> 00:26:18,982
<i>Water.</i>

305
00:26:21,185 --> 00:26:22,819
Water.

306
00:26:22,854 --> 00:26:25,088
This needs to be
cleaned and closed.

307
00:26:29,661 --> 00:26:31,830
What's your name, friend?

308
00:26:31,864 --> 00:26:33,731
Qyburn.

309
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:35,133
You're lucky to be alive.

310
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:40,872
Lucky?

311
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:08,837
The badge
looks good on you.

312
00:27:10,673 --> 00:27:13,308
Almost as good
as it looked on me.

313
00:27:15,577 --> 00:27:18,680
Are you enjoying
your new position?

314
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:21,850
Am I enjoying it?

315
00:27:21,884 --> 00:27:24,286
I was very happy
as Hand of the King.

316
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,354
Yes.

317
00:27:26,388 --> 00:27:28,356
I heard how happy you were.

318
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:32,860
You brought a whore
into my bed.

319
00:27:32,894 --> 00:27:35,496
It wasn't your bed
at the time.

320
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:40,868
I sent you here
to advise the king.

321
00:27:40,902 --> 00:27:44,938
I gave you real power
and authority.

322
00:27:44,972 --> 00:27:47,307
You chose
to spend your days

323
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:49,509
as you always have,

324
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,978
bedding harlots

325
00:27:52,012 --> 00:27:54,380
and drinking with thieves.

326
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,185
Occasionally I drank
with the harlots.

327
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,587
What do you want, Tyrion?

328
00:28:01,622 --> 00:28:04,624
Why does everyone assume
I want something?

329
00:28:04,658 --> 00:28:07,560
Can't I simply visit
with my beloved father?

330
00:28:07,595 --> 00:28:11,197
My beloved father who

331
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,933
somehow forgot to visit
his wounded son

332
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:15,801
after he fell
on the battlefield.

333
00:28:15,836 --> 00:28:19,405
Maester Pycelle assured me
your wounds were not fatal.

334
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:22,441
I organized
the defense of this city

335
00:28:22,475 --> 00:28:25,644
while you held court
in the ruins of Harrenhal.

336
00:28:25,678 --> 00:28:28,412
I led the foray when the
enemies were at the gate

337
00:28:28,447 --> 00:28:30,715
while your grandson,
the king,

338
00:28:30,749 --> 00:28:33,384
quivered in fear
behind the walls.

339
00:28:33,418 --> 00:28:37,021
I bled in the mud
for our family.

340
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,524
And as my reward,

341
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:42,894
I was trundled off
to some dark little cell.

342
00:28:42,928 --> 00:28:44,929
But what do I want?

343
00:28:46,265 --> 00:28:48,399
A little bloody gratitude
would be a start.

344
00:28:48,434 --> 00:28:51,669
Jugglers and singers
require applause.

345
00:28:51,704 --> 00:28:54,139
You are a Lannister.

346
00:28:54,173 --> 00:28:57,208
<i>Do you think I demanded</i>
<i>a garland of roses</i>

347
00:28:57,243 --> 00:28:59,945
<i>every time I suffered</i>
<i>a wound on a battlefield?</i>

348
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:01,946
Hmm?

349
00:29:02,014 --> 00:29:05,783
Now, I have seven kingdoms
to look after

350
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:08,185
and three of them
are in open rebellion.

351
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,990
So tell me what you want.

352
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:19,698
I want what is mine
by right.

353
00:29:21,401 --> 00:29:24,737
Jaime is your eldest son,
heir to your lands and titles.

354
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:29,076
But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden
from marriage or inheritance.

355
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,145
The day Jaime put on
the white cloak,

356
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:34,948
he gave up his claim
to Casterly Rock.

357
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:38,051
I am your son
and lawful heir.

358
00:29:41,022 --> 00:29:42,656
You want Casterly Rock?

359
00:29:42,691 --> 00:29:44,658
It is mine by right.

360
00:29:49,231 --> 00:29:51,332
We'll find you
accommodations

361
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:53,268
more suited
to your name

362
00:29:53,302 --> 00:29:55,670
<i>and as a reward</i>
<i>for your accomplishments</i>

363
00:29:55,704 --> 00:29:58,573
during the battle
of Blackwater Bay.

364
00:30:00,276 --> 00:30:02,277
And when the time is right,
you will be given a position

365
00:30:02,311 --> 00:30:03,978
<i>fit for your talents</i>

366
00:30:04,013 --> 00:30:06,548
so that you can
serve your family

367
00:30:06,582 --> 00:30:08,683
and protect our legacy.

368
00:30:08,718 --> 00:30:10,352
<i>And if you serve</i>
<i>faithfully,</i>

369
00:30:10,386 --> 00:30:12,921
<i>you will be rewarded</i>
<i>with a suitable wife.</i>

370
00:30:12,955 --> 00:30:16,791
And I would let myself
be consumed by maggots

371
00:30:16,825 --> 00:30:18,093
<i>before mocking</i>
<i>the family name</i>

372
00:30:18,127 --> 00:30:21,063
<i>and making you</i>
<i>heir to Casterly Rock.</i>

373
00:30:22,665 --> 00:30:25,466
- Why?
- Why?

374
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,635
You ask that?

375
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:31,071
You, who killed your mother
to come into the world?

376
00:30:31,106 --> 00:30:35,242
You are an ill-made,
spiteful little creature

377
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:39,280
full of envy, lust,
and low cunning.

378
00:30:39,314 --> 00:30:41,882
<i>Men's laws give you</i>
<i>the right to bear my name</i>

379
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:46,520
and display my colors since I
cannot prove that you are not mine.

380
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:50,591
<i>And to teach me humility,</i>
<i>the gods have condemned me</i>

381
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:54,027
to watch you waddle about
wearing that proud lion

382
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:57,965
that was my father's sigil
and his father's before him.

383
00:30:57,999 --> 00:30:59,700
But neither gods nor men

384
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:02,636
will ever compel me
to let you turn Casterly Rock

385
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,772
<i>into your whorehouse.</i>

386
00:31:05,807 --> 00:31:08,675
Go, now.

387
00:31:11,846 --> 00:31:15,582
Speak no more of your rights
to Casterly Rock.

388
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,786
Go.

389
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,896
Oh, one more thing.

390
00:31:33,233 --> 00:31:36,435
The next whore I catch
in your bed I'll hang.

391
00:31:44,378 --> 00:31:47,181
<i>Dorne.</i>
<i>It's going to Dorne.</i>

392
00:31:47,215 --> 00:31:50,117
<i>- Why Dorne?</i>
- It's carrying silk

393
00:31:50,152 --> 00:31:53,621
and it's supposed to bring
back wine in exchange.

394
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,993
But it's not
coming back.

395
00:32:00,028 --> 00:32:02,629
The captain's tired
of risking his life

396
00:32:02,664 --> 00:32:04,832
so King's Landing
lords and ladies

397
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:07,935
can get drunk on better
wine than they deserve.

398
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:11,506
He's going
to stay in Dorne.

399
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:14,876
Wait out the winter where
it's beautiful and warm.

400
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:18,680
I met some people in Dorne who
weren't so beautiful and warm.

401
00:32:18,715 --> 00:32:20,683
Don't ruin the game.

402
00:32:20,717 --> 00:32:23,453
I told you,
I don't want to play.

403
00:32:24,555 --> 00:32:26,589
What about that one there?

404
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,091
That one?

405
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:30,127
It's going to Volantis.

406
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:31,595
Why?

407
00:32:31,629 --> 00:32:33,330
Because when I got
on a ship in Volantis,

408
00:32:33,364 --> 00:32:35,899
it looked like that one.

409
00:32:35,934 --> 00:32:37,735
That's not how
the game works.

410
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:41,339
You're not supposed to just
blurt out the right answer.

411
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:42,973
You've got
to invent a story

412
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:46,443
about where the ship
is going and why.

413
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:49,347
Why should I make up a story
when I know the truth?

414
00:32:49,381 --> 00:32:51,415
Because the truth

415
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,985
is always either
terrible or boring.

416
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:56,788
Lovely day for it.

417
00:32:56,822 --> 00:32:58,724
Watching the ships.

418
00:32:58,758 --> 00:33:01,727
Lord Baelish.

419
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:04,797
Might I speak
with Lady Sansa

420
00:33:04,832 --> 00:33:06,466
alone for a moment?

421
00:33:17,945 --> 00:33:20,813
I saw your mother
not long ago.

422
00:33:22,215 --> 00:33:24,516
She's very eager
to see you.

423
00:33:26,286 --> 00:33:29,587
And your sister.

424
00:33:29,622 --> 00:33:32,224
Arya's alive?

425
00:33:35,528 --> 00:33:37,395
You said
you'd take me home.

426
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:40,798
You said King's Landing
was your home.

427
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,367
You are the property
of the crown.

428
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:44,768
Stealing you
would be treason.

429
00:33:44,803 --> 00:33:47,037
If you were to tell
just one person--

430
00:33:47,072 --> 00:33:49,073
- I won't tell anyone.
- How do I know?

431
00:33:49,107 --> 00:33:51,041
Because I'm a terrible liar.

432
00:33:51,075 --> 00:33:53,710
You said so yourself.

433
00:33:53,744 --> 00:33:56,913
Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do.
Tell me when.

434
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,684
I'm waiting for word
on an assignment

435
00:34:01,718 --> 00:34:04,920
that will take me far away
from the capital.

436
00:34:04,988 --> 00:34:06,655
When I set sail,

437
00:34:06,689 --> 00:34:09,224
I might be able
to take you with me.

438
00:34:09,258 --> 00:34:12,260
But you'll need to be ready to
leave on a moment's notice.

439
00:34:14,697 --> 00:34:16,965
You're her handmaiden?

440
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:21,837
Yes.
And you're his...?

441
00:34:21,871 --> 00:34:25,341
I help manage
his affairs.

442
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:28,778
- He's an important person.
- So is she.

443
00:34:28,812 --> 00:34:31,346
I grew up in the shadow
of her father's castle.

444
00:34:31,381 --> 00:34:33,382
The day she was born,
they rang the bells

445
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:35,818
from sunrise till sunset.

446
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:40,823
We've both done
rather well, you and I.

447
00:34:43,394 --> 00:34:45,161
Yes.

448
00:34:45,195 --> 00:34:48,431
Given where we started.

449
00:34:48,465 --> 00:34:50,700
And where is that?

450
00:34:52,169 --> 00:34:54,236
It's not easy
for girls like us

451
00:34:54,271 --> 00:34:56,439
to dig our way out.

452
00:35:01,211 --> 00:35:03,812
<i>Watch out for her.</i>

453
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:06,681
I always do.

454
00:35:06,716 --> 00:35:09,417
Watch out for her
with him.

455
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:03,808
They're growing fast.

456
00:36:07,012 --> 00:36:08,545
Not fast enough.

457
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:11,983
I can't wait that long.

458
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,855
I need an army.

459
00:36:18,224 --> 00:36:20,658
We'll be in Astapor
by nightfall.

460
00:36:22,561 --> 00:36:24,729
Some say the Unsullied are the
greatest soldiers in the world.

461
00:36:24,764 --> 00:36:27,566
The greatest slave-soldiers
in the world.

462
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,902
The distinction means
a good deal to some people.

463
00:36:29,936 --> 00:36:31,770
Do those people
have any better ideas

464
00:36:31,804 --> 00:36:35,073
about how to put you
on the Iron Throne?

465
00:36:36,775 --> 00:36:38,610
It's too beautiful
a day to argue.

466
00:36:42,214 --> 00:36:43,948
You're right.

467
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:49,153
Another lovely day
on the high seas.

468
00:36:49,187 --> 00:36:50,954
<i>Don't mock them.</i>

469
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:53,357
They're the first Dothraki
who have ever been on a ship.

470
00:36:53,424 --> 00:36:55,759
They followed me
across the poison water.

471
00:36:55,793 --> 00:36:57,094
If they'll do it,
others will.

472
00:36:57,128 --> 00:36:58,661
And with a true
khalasar--

473
00:36:58,696 --> 00:37:02,799
The Dothraki follow strength
above all, khaleesi.

474
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:06,602
You'll have a true khalasar
when you prove yourself strong.

475
00:37:06,637 --> 00:37:08,838
And not before.

476
00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:37,666
Your Grace.

477
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:51,248
I heard you were dead.

478
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:53,150
Not yet.

479
00:37:55,286 --> 00:37:58,155
I had hoped to speak
to you alone, Your Grace.

480
00:37:59,224 --> 00:38:01,225
We are alone.

481
00:38:11,237 --> 00:38:14,406
Your Grace, you are
the rightful king.

482
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,309
<i>Not only by blood.</i>

483
00:38:17,343 --> 00:38:20,312
You're an honorable man,
a just man.

484
00:38:20,346 --> 00:38:22,648
And there is still
a war to fight.

485
00:38:22,682 --> 00:38:25,383
I am fighting.

486
00:38:25,418 --> 00:38:28,053
By burning
prisoners alive?

487
00:38:30,357 --> 00:38:32,124
How would you punish
the infidels, Ser Davos?

488
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:34,594
I do not judge people
for the gods they worship.

489
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:36,729
If I did, I'd have
thrown you in the sea

490
00:38:36,763 --> 00:38:39,498
before you ever set foot
on Dragonstone.

491
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,234
- I'm not your enemy.
- You are my enemy.

492
00:38:46,173 --> 00:38:48,574
Was it me you fought
on Blackwater Bay?

493
00:38:49,877 --> 00:38:52,378
<i>Did I set</i>
<i>your ships ablaze?</i>

494
00:38:55,883 --> 00:39:00,020
I wasn't there when the wildfire
killed our men by the thousands.

495
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:04,692
I could have
saved those men.

496
00:39:04,726 --> 00:39:06,360
You would have
taken the city,

497
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:08,269
Stannis would now sit
upon his rightful throne,

498
00:39:08,297 --> 00:39:09,965
and you would
stand beside him.

499
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:12,534
<i>But I wasn't there</i>

500
00:39:12,568 --> 00:39:16,238
because you convinced
your king to leave me behind.

501
00:39:24,414 --> 00:39:27,449
Do you hear them screaming?

502
00:39:27,483 --> 00:39:30,786
All those burning men
in the water

503
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,488
crying for their mothers,

504
00:39:33,523 --> 00:39:36,391
for their gods for help?

505
00:39:36,425 --> 00:39:39,160
Until the moment
the Blackwater swallowed them.

506
00:39:46,034 --> 00:39:48,435
Don't despair, Ser Davos.

507
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,837
What I told
your son is true.

508
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:53,239
Death by fire

509
00:39:53,274 --> 00:39:54,975
is the purest death.

510
00:39:56,878 --> 00:39:59,112
This woman is evil!

511
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,814
She's the mother of demons.

512
00:40:00,848 --> 00:40:03,683
Take him to the dungeon
and lock him in a cell.

513
00:40:03,718 --> 00:40:05,218
- Your Grace!
- Come on.

514
00:40:05,253 --> 00:40:06,520
You've chosen
the darkness, Ser Davos.

515
00:40:06,554 --> 00:40:09,422
- She will destroy us all!
- I will pray for you.

516
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,458
<i>Your Grace!</i>

517
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:41,521
<i>Halt. Down.</i>

518
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,592
<i>Halt. Down.</i>

519
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,067
Why have we stopped?

520
00:40:53,101 --> 00:40:54,635
It's Lady Margaery,
Your Grace.

521
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:01,809
<i>What is she doing?</i>
<i>Who gave her permission?</i>

522
00:41:01,843 --> 00:41:05,746
My lady. We should have
guards, my lady.

523
00:41:05,781 --> 00:41:08,149
Why?

524
00:41:11,287 --> 00:41:13,054
Pardon me.

525
00:41:20,063 --> 00:41:23,499
Stop, my lady.
You'll ruin your dress.

526
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:25,334
I have others.

527
00:41:31,141 --> 00:41:33,542
Would you like to speak
with her, Your Grace?

528
00:41:36,513 --> 00:41:38,814
No.

529
00:41:38,882 --> 00:41:40,582
He was a soldier.

530
00:41:40,617 --> 00:41:42,517
He went to fight
on the walls

531
00:41:42,552 --> 00:41:45,120
when the ships came
into Blackwater Bay.

532
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:47,222
He never came back.

533
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:49,057
And your mother?

534
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:51,492
She died
when she had me.

535
00:41:54,063 --> 00:41:56,331
Bad men wanted
to come into this city

536
00:41:56,365 --> 00:42:00,034
and do terrible things,
but your father stopped them.

537
00:42:06,041 --> 00:42:08,043
Whenever you look
at this knight,

538
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:10,912
I want you to remember
your father.

539
00:42:13,582 --> 00:42:15,382
He wasn't a knight.

540
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:17,351
He was just a soldier.

541
00:42:17,385 --> 00:42:19,753
And what do knights
swear to do?

542
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:23,122
Protect the weak
and uphold the good.

543
00:42:23,157 --> 00:42:26,892
Your father did that.
Be proud of him.

544
00:42:29,629 --> 00:42:32,798
Was your father
a soldier, too?

545
00:42:33,866 --> 00:42:36,735
You should be proud, too.

546
00:42:38,605 --> 00:42:40,906
Under King Joffrey's
leadership,

547
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,675
your fathers
saved the city.

548
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:46,011
They saved us all.

549
00:42:46,045 --> 00:42:49,415
From now on, we're going
to take care of you.

550
00:42:51,818 --> 00:42:53,852
All of you.

551
00:43:00,659 --> 00:43:02,660
Come to me for whatever
you need to feed them,

552
00:43:02,695 --> 00:43:04,762
clothe them,
or house them.

553
00:43:06,565 --> 00:43:08,665
Directly to me.

554
00:43:23,414 --> 00:43:25,582
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

555
00:43:25,617 --> 00:43:27,217
Please, sit.
Sit.

556
00:43:27,252 --> 00:43:29,720
I do apologize,
my lady.

557
00:43:29,754 --> 00:43:32,090
Small council meetings.

558
00:43:32,124 --> 00:43:34,225
At what point
does it become treason

559
00:43:34,259 --> 00:43:36,127
to waste the king's time?

560
00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:42,568
That's a lovely gown,
my lady.

561
00:43:42,603 --> 00:43:44,604
Yes, it suits you
perfectly.

562
00:43:44,638 --> 00:43:47,040
I imagine you might
be rather cold.

563
00:43:47,074 --> 00:43:50,444
The climate is a bit more forgiving
back in Highgarden, Your Grace.

564
00:43:50,478 --> 00:43:54,180
Shall I have them bring
you a shawl, my lady?

565
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,683
I am touched by your
concern, Your Grace.

566
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:59,920
Luckily for us Tyrells,
our blood runs quite warm.

567
00:43:59,954 --> 00:44:01,922
- <i>Doesn't it, Loras?</i>
- Yes.

568
00:44:01,956 --> 00:44:05,059
Loras, isn't the queen's
gown magnificent?

569
00:44:05,093 --> 00:44:07,961
The fabric, the embroidery,
the metalwork.

570
00:44:07,996 --> 00:44:09,630
I've never seen
anything like it.

571
00:44:09,664 --> 00:44:11,565
You might find a bit
of armor quite useful

572
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,201
once you become queen.
Perhaps before.

573
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:18,038
<i>Joffrey tells me you stopped
your carriage at Flea Bottom</i>

574
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,840
on your way back from
the sept this morning.

575
00:44:19,874 --> 00:44:24,244
Yes. I paid a visit
to an orphanage

576
00:44:24,278 --> 00:44:25,812
the High Septon
told me about.

577
00:44:25,846 --> 00:44:28,527
Margaery does a great deal of work
with the poor back in Highgarden.

578
00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:32,853
The lowest among us are no different from
the highest if you give them a chance

579
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:35,156
and approach them
with an open heart.

580
00:44:35,223 --> 00:44:37,258
<i>An open heart is what</i>
<i>you'll get in Flea Bottom</i>

581
00:44:37,292 --> 00:44:38,859
<i>if you're not careful,</i>
<i>my dear.</i>

582
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:42,729
Not long ago, we were
attacked by a mob there.

583
00:44:42,797 --> 00:44:45,699
We had a full complement
of guards that didn't stop them.

584
00:44:45,733 --> 00:44:48,702
The king barely escaped
with his life.

585
00:44:48,736 --> 00:44:52,206
My mother's always had
a penchant for drama.

586
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:54,809
Facts become less and less
important to her

587
00:44:54,843 --> 00:44:56,844
<i>as she grows older.</i>

588
00:44:56,912 --> 00:44:59,814
Our lives were never
truly in danger.

589
00:45:01,049 --> 00:45:02,783
You're right, of course.

590
00:45:02,818 --> 00:45:06,053
But you are
your father's son.

591
00:45:06,088 --> 00:45:08,255
We can't all have
a king's bravery.

592
00:45:16,432 --> 00:45:18,633
Hunger turns men
into beasts.

593
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:22,504
I'm glad House Tyrell has been
able to help in this regard.

594
00:45:22,539 --> 00:45:26,375
They tell me 100 wagons arrive
daily now from the Reach.

595
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:29,912
<i>Wheat, barley, apples.</i>
<i>We've had a blessed harvest.</i>

596
00:45:29,947 --> 00:45:32,615
And, of course, it's our
duty to assist the capital

597
00:45:32,649 --> 00:45:34,684
in time of need.

598
00:45:34,718 --> 00:45:36,419
Well, as Ser Loras said,

599
00:45:36,453 --> 00:45:39,589
Lady Margaery has done
this sort of...

600
00:45:39,623 --> 00:45:41,557
charitable work before.

601
00:45:42,693 --> 00:45:44,727
I'm sure she knows
what she's doing.

602
00:45:46,096 --> 00:45:48,131
I'm sure she does.

603
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:19,363
The Unsullied have stood here
for a day and a night

604
00:46:19,398 --> 00:46:21,533
with no food or water.

605
00:46:27,841 --> 00:46:29,775
They will stand
until they drop.

606
00:46:32,112 --> 00:46:34,012
Such is their
obedience.

607
00:46:36,049 --> 00:46:38,117
They may suit my needs.

608
00:46:38,151 --> 00:46:40,119
Tell me of their training.

609
00:47:00,408 --> 00:47:02,976
They begin their
training at five.

610
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:04,978
Every day they drill
from dawn to dusk

611
00:47:05,013 --> 00:47:07,181
until they have mastered
the shortsword,

612
00:47:07,215 --> 00:47:09,616
the shield,
and the three spears.

613
00:47:09,651 --> 00:47:13,254
Only one boy in four survives
this rigorous training.

614
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:19,326
<i>Their discipline</i>
<i>and loyalty are absolute.</i>

615
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,128
<i>They fear nothing.</i>

616
00:47:21,162 --> 00:47:24,197
Even the bravest men
fear death.

617
00:47:45,353 --> 00:47:48,322
<i>My master says</i>
<i>the Unsullied are not men.</i>

618
00:47:48,356 --> 00:47:50,724
Death means nothing
to them.

619
00:47:59,233 --> 00:48:02,201
He begs you attend to this
carefully, Your Grace.

620
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:18,851
Tell the good master
there is no need.

621
00:48:26,626 --> 00:48:29,594
<i>My master points out</i>
<i>that men don't need nipples.</i>

622
00:48:45,412 --> 00:48:47,580
To win his shield,

623
00:48:47,614 --> 00:48:51,350
an Unsullied must go to the
slave marts with a silver mark,

624
00:48:51,384 --> 00:48:56,355
find a newborn and kill it
before its mother's eyes.

625
00:48:58,692 --> 00:49:01,126
<i>This way, my master says,</i>
<i>we make certain</i>

626
00:49:01,161 --> 00:49:03,262
<i>there is no weakness</i>
<i>left in them.</i>

627
00:49:04,598 --> 00:49:07,400
You take a babe
from its mother's arms,

628
00:49:07,434 --> 00:49:11,737
kill it as she watches, and pay
for her pain with a silver coin?

629
00:49:25,652 --> 00:49:28,253
My master would like you to
know that the silver is paid

630
00:49:28,288 --> 00:49:30,856
to the baby's owner,
not the mother.

631
00:49:36,997 --> 00:49:38,964
How many do you
have to sell?

632
00:49:44,305 --> 00:49:46,273
8,000.

633
00:49:50,912 --> 00:49:53,548
Master Kraznys asks
that you please hurry.

634
00:49:53,582 --> 00:49:56,417
Many other buyers
are interested.

635
00:50:06,561 --> 00:50:09,730
8,000 dead babies.

636
00:50:09,765 --> 00:50:12,333
The Unsullied
are a means to an end.

637
00:50:12,367 --> 00:50:14,702
Once I own them,
these men--

638
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:17,271
They're not men.
Not anymore.

639
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:20,674
Once I own an army of
slaves, what will I be?

640
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:22,776
Do you think these slaves
will have better lives

641
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:26,246
serving Kraznys and men
like him or serving you?

642
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,460
You'll be fair to them.

643
00:50:41,495 --> 00:50:44,263
You won't mutilate them
to make a point.

644
00:50:48,836 --> 00:50:51,037
You won't order them
to murder babies.

645
00:50:51,072 --> 00:50:53,907
You'll see they're properly
fed and sheltered.

646
00:50:53,941 --> 00:50:56,776
A great injustice
has been done to them.

647
00:50:57,946 --> 00:51:00,480
Closing your eyes
will not undo it.

648
00:51:57,269 --> 00:51:59,204
The warlocks.

649
00:52:02,676 --> 00:52:05,545
I owe you my life, ser.

650
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:07,214
The honor is mine,

651
00:52:07,248 --> 00:52:09,449
my queen.

652
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:15,088
You know this man?

653
00:52:15,122 --> 00:52:16,923
I know him

654
00:52:16,957 --> 00:52:21,428
as one of the greatest fighters
the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen

655
00:52:21,462 --> 00:52:23,030
and as the Lord Commander

656
00:52:23,064 --> 00:52:25,832
of Robert Baratheon's
Kingsguard.

657
00:52:27,368 --> 00:52:29,303
King Robert is dead.

658
00:52:29,337 --> 00:52:32,206
I have been searching
for you, Daenerys Stormborn,

659
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,775
to ask your forgiveness.

660
00:52:34,809 --> 00:52:37,845
I was sworn to protect
your family.

661
00:52:39,581 --> 00:52:41,515
I failed them.

662
00:52:46,922 --> 00:52:49,190
I am Barristan Selmy,

663
00:52:49,224 --> 00:52:51,526
Kingsguard to your father.

664
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,961
<i>Allow me to join</i>
<i>your Queensguard</i>

665
00:52:53,996 --> 00:52:57,065
and I will not
fail you again.
