1
00:00:02,715 --> 00:00:05,216
Do you really think I'll let you
sell her like a common whore?

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,185
Dorne is the safest
place for her.

3
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:10,020
- You cannot stop it.
- No!

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,928
No, wait.
It wasn't her.

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,899
You can't avenge him if you're dead.

6
00:00:23,934 --> 00:00:27,369
On behalf of the warlocks
of Qarth, I welcome you.

7
00:00:29,172 --> 00:00:32,040
It would be an honor to host you
at the House of the Undying,

8
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:34,209
Mother of Dragons.

9
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:36,379
<i>Stannis will be here</i>
<i>in an hour.</i>

10
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:38,181
Renly's bannermen
will flock to him.

11
00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:40,083
Calling yourself king
doesn't make you one.

12
00:00:40,117 --> 00:00:42,819
And if Renly wasn't a king,
I wasn't a queen.

13
00:00:42,853 --> 00:00:46,122
- Do you want to be a queen?
- I want to be <i>the</i> queen.

14
00:00:46,157 --> 00:00:47,791
There on that mountain.

15
00:00:47,826 --> 00:00:50,394
We need to get rid
of those lookouts.

16
00:00:50,428 --> 00:00:52,629
I need to move fast
and silent.

17
00:00:52,664 --> 00:00:54,965
Lord Commander, 
I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.

18
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:56,233
Aye.

19
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:57,735
Are you going
to kill Joffrey?

20
00:00:57,769 --> 00:00:59,837
- If the Gods give me strength.
- And then what?

21
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:01,705
First we have to
win the war.

22
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,541
You never told me
where you're from.

23
00:01:03,575 --> 00:01:05,109
<i>Volantis.</i>

24
00:01:05,143 --> 00:01:07,311
You're one of them now.
I should have let you burn.

25
00:01:07,346 --> 00:01:09,346
You saved me
and the two I was with.

26
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:11,215
You stole three deaths
from the Red God.

27
00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:13,417
- Speak three names.
- I can name anyone?

28
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:15,686
- <i>And you'll kill him?</i>
- A man has said.

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,221
<i>The one who tortures everyone.</i>
<i>They call him the Tickler.</i>

30
00:01:20,024 --> 00:01:22,291
The Stony Shore's not far
from Torrhen's Square.

31
00:01:22,326 --> 00:01:24,827
More impressive prize than
a few fisherman's daughters.

32
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:27,229
Soon as Winterfell got word that
we'd taken Torrhen's Square,

33
00:01:27,263 --> 00:01:29,598
the Starks would send
their men to take it back.

34
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:31,600
Take me to my ship.

35
00:01:31,635 --> 00:01:34,303
Lord Stark, Torrhen's Square
is under siege.

36
00:01:34,337 --> 00:01:36,639
Torrhen's Square is barely
40 leagues from here.

37
00:01:36,674 --> 00:01:38,474
Go, Ser Rodrik.
Take the men you need.

38
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:40,009
<i>What did you see</i>
<i>in your dream?</i>

39
00:01:40,044 --> 00:01:41,478
That the sea came
to Winterfell.

40
00:01:41,513 --> 00:01:43,314
<i>Drowned men were</i>
<i>floating in the yard.</i>

41
00:01:43,348 --> 00:01:48,652
Ser Rodrik
was one of them.

00:04:20,137 --> 00:04:22,973
I've taken your castle.

48
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:25,709
- Theon?
- It's Prince Theon now.

49
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:28,278
Get up.
You have to get dressed.

50
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:30,681
I've taken Winterfell.

51
00:04:30,716 --> 00:04:33,717
I took it.
I'm occupying it.

52
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:36,853
I sent men over the walls
with grappling claws and ropes.

53
00:04:36,888 --> 00:04:39,990
- Why?
- To take the castle.

54
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:44,427
- You went with Robb.
- And he sent me back to Pyke.

55
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:48,097
I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight
for Robb and my father both.

56
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:52,167
- Where's Hodor?
- I don't know.

57
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:54,570
Find the Halfwit.

58
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:57,540
My men are bringing your people
together in the courtyard.

59
00:04:57,574 --> 00:04:59,008
Why?

60
00:04:59,043 --> 00:05:01,010
So you and I can
go down and tell them

61
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:03,913
- how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
- I won't.

62
00:05:03,947 --> 00:05:06,015
Yes, you will.

63
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:09,117
I won't.
I'll never yield.

64
00:05:09,152 --> 00:05:11,220
We'll fight you
and throw you out.

65
00:05:17,194 --> 00:05:18,628
The castle is mine,

66
00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:21,098
but these people
are still yours.

67
00:05:21,132 --> 00:05:23,300
You'll yield
to keep them safe,

68
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:25,804
to keep them alive.

69
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:28,640
That's what a good
lord would do.

70
00:05:31,443 --> 00:05:34,278
Think carefully about
what you want to say.

71
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:39,383
Theon.

72
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:41,384
Did you hate us
the whole time?

73
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:51,327
I've yielded
Winterfell to Theon.

74
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:53,296
Louder.

75
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,131
Say Prince Theon.

76
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:58,202
I've yielded Winterfell
to Prince Theon.

77
00:05:58,236 --> 00:05:59,937
You all know me.

78
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:02,773
Aye, we know you for
a steaming sack of shit.

79
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:04,475
Farlen, you be silent.

80
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:07,612
Listen to your
little Lord, Farlen.

81
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:09,414
He has more sense
than you do.

82
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,316
All of you should do
as he commands.

83
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:15,053
My father has donned the
ancient crown of salt and rock

84
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:18,590
and declared himself
King of the Iron Islands.

85
00:06:18,624 --> 00:06:21,826
He claims the North as well
by right of conquest.

86
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:23,628
You are all his subjects.

87
00:06:23,662 --> 00:06:26,398
Bugger that.
I serve the Starks.

88
00:06:26,432 --> 00:06:28,524
If you think you can
hold the North with this--

89
00:06:28,549 --> 00:06:29,834
Shut up!

90
00:06:29,835 --> 00:06:33,305
<i>If you serve me as loyally</i>
<i>as you served Ned Stark,</i>

91
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:36,408
<i>I  will be as good to you</i>
<i>as he ever was.</i>

92
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:38,543
Betray me, and you will
wish you hadn't.

93
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:43,515
Maester Luwin,
send a raven to Pyke

94
00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:46,250
informing my father
of my victory here

95
00:06:46,284 --> 00:06:48,853
and one to Deepwood Motte
to my sister.

96
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:53,190
Inform her that she's
to bring 500 men to Winterfell.

97
00:06:56,728 --> 00:06:58,929
You are a Maester
of the Citadel

98
00:06:58,963 --> 00:07:02,231
sworn to serve the lord
of Winterfell, are you not?

99
00:07:02,265 --> 00:07:03,666
I am.

100
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,568
I am the Lord
of Winterfell

101
00:07:05,602 --> 00:07:07,536
as Bran just informed you.

102
00:07:09,072 --> 00:07:11,174
Send the ravens.

103
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:15,378
My Lord.

104
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:20,151
My Lord Greyjoy.

105
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:23,688
I see you've finally learned
how to address your betters.

106
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:25,257
What do you want?

107
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,559
I was brought here
a captive.

108
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:29,962
You were here the day
I was taken.

109
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:33,966
I'm the one who took you.
What of it?

110
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,702
Let me serve you.

111
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:39,338
<i>Serve me how?</i>

112
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:41,840
I need fighters,
not kitchen sluts.

113
00:07:41,874 --> 00:07:44,876
It was Robb Stark who
put me in the kitchens.

114
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:47,446
Put a spear
in my hand again.

115
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,548
So you can bury it
in my neck?

116
00:07:49,582 --> 00:07:51,150
Do you take me
for a fool?

117
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:52,618
Get up.

118
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:55,721
Step aside.

119
00:07:55,756 --> 00:07:58,023
Why?

120
00:07:58,058 --> 00:08:01,494
It's your dream,
Little Lord.

121
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:04,965
The ocean has come
to swallow this place.

122
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:07,935
I ain't letting it
drown me.

123
00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:10,771
- And in a few days' time--
<i>Greyjoy!</i>

124
00:08:15,777 --> 00:08:17,878
<i>What have they</i>
<i>done to him?</i>

125
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:20,981
We caught this one on this way
back from Torrhen's Square.

126
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:23,950
Took out two of ours
before I got his sword.

127
00:08:23,984 --> 00:08:27,420
Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that
we meet as foes.

128
00:08:27,454 --> 00:08:31,291
It grieves me you've less honor
than a back alley whore.

129
00:08:31,325 --> 00:08:34,794
You were raised here
under this roof.

130
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:37,497
- These people are your people.
- They are not my people.

131
00:08:37,532 --> 00:08:39,733
King Robb thought of you
as a brother.

132
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:42,703
My brothers are dead.

133
00:08:42,737 --> 00:08:45,506
They died fighting
Stark men, men like you.

134
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,976
Aye, they died fighting
a war your father started.

135
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,245
Lord Stark raised you
among his own sons.

136
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,413
Among them,
but not one of them.

137
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:56,249
I was his hostage
taken from my home.

138
00:08:56,283 --> 00:08:57,984
If he were alive
to see this--

139
00:08:58,018 --> 00:08:59,853
He's not.
He's dead.

140
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:01,955
The Seven Kingdoms
are at war.

141
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:04,257
And Winterfell is mine.

142
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:06,960
I should have put
a sword in your belly

143
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:08,528
instead of
in your hand.

144
00:09:08,562 --> 00:09:11,664
You've served this House
faithfully, old man.

145
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:13,767
But keep talking
and I'll--

146
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:18,605
Take him to the cells.
Lock him up--

147
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,341
My prince,

148
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,943
you cannot let that stand.
He must pay.

149
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:24,878
I'll lock him in a cell
until he rots--

150
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:27,915
No, he has to pay
the iron price.

151
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:31,052
They'll never respect
you while he lives.

152
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:51,575
Ser Rodrik,

153
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,043
I sentence you to death.

154
00:09:53,078 --> 00:09:55,545
No! You said no harm
would come to them if I yielded.

155
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,948
The old man couldn't
keep his mouth shut.

156
00:09:57,982 --> 00:10:00,650
I urge you not to make
a hasty decision.

157
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:03,654
He disrespected me
in front of my men.

158
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:05,155
That was his decision,
not mine.

159
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:07,657
He is worth more
to you alive than dead.

160
00:10:07,993 --> 00:10:10,994
The Starks will pay.

161
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:13,864
Please, Theon,

162
00:10:13,898 --> 00:10:15,832
think what you do.

163
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:28,376
You'll address me
as Prince Theon

164
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:30,311
or you'll be next.

165
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:32,313
Come.

166
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:34,749
No!

167
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:37,985
- No!
<i>- Theon!</i>

168
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:40,922
Please!

169
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:42,824
Ser Rodrik!

170
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:45,694
He who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

171
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,497
<i>- I'm begging you!</i>
- Coward.

172
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:54,369
Stop! Stop right now!

173
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,138
You don't give commands anymore,
Little Lord.

174
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:58,840
- Please, stop this. Please stop him.
<i>- Hush now, child.</i>

175
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,977
I'm off to see your father.

176
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:06,982
You said no harm
would come!

177
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:09,751
<i>You said no harm would come.</i>
<i>Theon, please.</i>

178
00:11:09,786 --> 00:11:12,588
Any last words, old man?

179
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:15,524
Gods help you,
Theon Greyjoy.

180
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,659
Now you are truly lost.

181
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:20,129
<i>Theon, please, don't.</i>

182
00:11:20,163 --> 00:11:23,265
<i>- Do something.</i>
<i>- I'll do anything. Please!</i>

183
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:24,934
<i>No, please, stop it!</i>

184
00:11:56,368 --> 00:11:58,770
Ghost, stay with us.

185
00:11:58,804 --> 00:12:00,871
Ghost!

186
00:12:00,906 --> 00:12:02,540
There goes your pet.

187
00:12:02,574 --> 00:12:04,141
<i>He's not a pet.</i>

188
00:12:04,176 --> 00:12:06,677
<i>You're right,</i>
<i>he's not.</i>

189
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:09,280
You can't tame
a wild thing.

190
00:12:09,314 --> 00:12:11,081
You can't trust
a wild thing.

191
00:12:11,116 --> 00:12:14,151
- Ghost is different.
- So you think.

192
00:12:14,185 --> 00:12:16,553
Wild creatures
have their own rules,

193
00:12:16,588 --> 00:12:18,755
their own reasons.

194
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,758
And you'll never
know them.

195
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:24,461
Now the wildlings
we're looking for

196
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:26,897
sleep during the day
and hunt at night.

197
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:31,902
I thought you said
you couldn't know wild things.

198
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:33,837
I said you can't.

199
00:12:33,871 --> 00:12:36,907
They find a nice cave
to hide in while the sun's up

200
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:38,875
and do their killing
when it's dark.

201
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,945
- We could do the same.
- No, we couldn't.

202
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,181
This is their country.

203
00:12:44,215 --> 00:12:47,251
They know where to walk,
where not to walk.

204
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:49,187
I've lost good men
who fell into a crevasse

205
00:12:49,221 --> 00:12:51,356
they didn't see
till they were in it.

206
00:12:52,491 --> 00:12:54,960
My father always said
I'm of the North.

207
00:12:56,795 --> 00:12:59,664
- I wasn't joking.
- Look around, boy.

208
00:12:59,698 --> 00:13:02,934
This look like
home to you?

209
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:06,171
You start thinking
you know this place, it'll kill you.

210
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:09,507
You understand me?

211
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,976
No, you don't.

212
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,944
We're at war.

213
00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:15,646
We've always been at war.

214
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:18,215
It's never going to end 'cause
we're not fighting an enemy.

215
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,819
We're fighting the North
and it's not going anywhere.

216
00:13:21,853 --> 00:13:24,855
The Watch has given
you a great gift.

217
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:27,424
You only have one thing
to give in return--

218
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:28,892
your life.

219
00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:30,260
I'll gladly give my life.

220
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:32,662
I don't want you
to be glad about it.

221
00:13:32,697 --> 00:13:34,697
I want you to curse
and fight

222
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:37,166
until your heart's
done pumping.

223
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:39,636
And know this, boy--

224
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,372
your death will be a gift
for them south of the Wall.

225
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,607
They'll never know
what you've done.

226
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:47,142
They'll never know
how you died.

227
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:49,277
They won't even
know your damn name,

228
00:13:49,311 --> 00:13:52,213
but they'll be alive because
some nameless bastard

229
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:55,884
north of the Wall
gave his life for theirs.

230
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,053
Now, do you understand me?

231
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,822
I do.

232
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:03,224
You're even dumber
than you look.

233
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,494
It's just words, boy,

234
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:08,496
to keep us a little
warmer in the night,

235
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,767
make us feel like
we've got a purpose.

236
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:14,236
Come on.

237
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,605
We've got to find these
goat fuckers before night falls

238
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,219
and they find us.

239
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:32,457
- Can you read?
- My Lord?

240
00:14:32,492 --> 00:14:35,527
Can you read?

241
00:14:38,298 --> 00:14:41,599
This letter detailing
our infantry movements

242
00:14:41,634 --> 00:14:44,302
was meant for Lord Damon
of House Marbrand.

243
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:48,140
It was sent to Lord Marlyn
of House Dormand.

244
00:14:48,174 --> 00:14:50,175
My apologies, My Lord.
I must have--

245
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,746
Girl, fetch me the "History of the 
Greater and the Lesser Houses."

246
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,549
It's the one on the--

247
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,522
My cupbearer can read
better than you.

248
00:15:11,732 --> 00:15:14,901
To whom does House Dormand
owe allegiance?

249
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:19,338
My Lord, I--

250
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:22,175
To the Starks
of Winterfell!

251
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:26,412
Who have 20,000 men
and my son!

252
00:15:27,848 --> 00:15:29,949
I judged you might be
good for something more

253
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:32,551
than brutalizing peasants.

254
00:15:32,586 --> 00:15:34,953
I see I overestimated you.

255
00:15:36,422 --> 00:15:39,825
<i>If you ever put my son's</i>
<i>life at risk again, I'll...</i>

256
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:42,360
Leave us.

257
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:51,769
Put the book away, girl.

258
00:15:58,643 --> 00:16:02,279
Maybe you should devise our next
battle plan while you're about it.

259
00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:10,475
- Lord Petyr Baelish.
- Hmmm.

260
00:16:11,322 --> 00:16:13,457
Give us the room.

261
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:22,968
Clear all this.

262
00:16:26,106 --> 00:16:28,908
- Lord Tywin.
- Baelish.

263
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:39,751
- Wine?
- Thank you.

264
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:44,589
What news
from the capital?

265
00:16:44,623 --> 00:16:48,025
I travelled here directly
from Renly Baratheon's camp.

266
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,227
Ah, the late king Renly.

267
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:52,463
Rather a short reign.

268
00:16:52,498 --> 00:16:54,499
Murdered by a woman,
I hear.

269
00:16:54,534 --> 00:16:56,468
So they say.

270
00:16:56,502 --> 00:17:01,641
There has been talk
of other forces at work,

271
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:04,110
dark forces.

272
00:17:04,145 --> 00:17:06,547
Here.

273
00:17:08,516 --> 00:17:10,952
Men love to blame demons

274
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:14,722
when their grand plans
unravel.

275
00:17:14,756 --> 00:17:17,558
It is my belief
that a moment of chaos

276
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:19,994
affords opportunities
lost soon after.

277
00:17:20,028 --> 00:17:23,164
You say that as if you were
the first man alive to think it.

278
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:26,333
Yes, a crisis
is an opportunity.

279
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:28,835
What other brilliant insights
have you brought me today?

280
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:30,570
After the Lannisters
and the Starks,

281
00:17:30,604 --> 00:17:33,039
the Tyrells command
the largest host.

282
00:17:33,074 --> 00:17:35,209
Their lands are the most
fertile in the Seven Kingdoms,

283
00:17:35,243 --> 00:17:39,179
- feeding horses and soldiers.
- Yes, yes, yes.

284
00:17:39,214 --> 00:17:43,618
The Tyrells have not yet declared
for any of the surviving kings.

285
00:17:43,653 --> 00:17:46,822
Loras wants revenge. He blames
Stannis for Renly's death.

286
00:17:46,856 --> 00:17:49,525
And Margaery--

287
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,328
Wants to be queen.

288
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,163
Yes, she does.

289
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:59,236
House Tyrell rebelled
against the Iron Throne,

290
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,840
- against my grandson.
- They did.

291
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,209
And perhaps that treason
should be punished

292
00:18:05,243 --> 00:18:07,145
<i>one day,</i>

293
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:11,148
after Stannis and Robb Stark
are defeated.

294
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:15,753
More wine for Lord Baelish.

295
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,129
If you will allow me to represent
your family's interests,

296
00:18:25,163 --> 00:18:27,230
I believe that an advantageous
agreement--

297
00:18:27,265 --> 00:18:30,333
The Tyrell host has
returned to Highgarden?

298
00:18:30,368 --> 00:18:32,535
They have.

299
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,470
Pardon, My Lord.

300
00:18:34,505 --> 00:18:36,439
It's only wine.

301
00:18:37,808 --> 00:18:39,942
You would ride
there yourself?

302
00:18:39,976 --> 00:18:41,877
Tonight, with your leave.

303
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:44,145
I'll have an answer
by nightfall.

304
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,847
That'll be all, girl.

305
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:52,988
What else?

306
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:55,156
On your son
Tyrion's directive,

307
00:18:55,191 --> 00:18:57,692
I met with Catelyn Stark.

308
00:18:57,727 --> 00:18:59,227
Why?

309
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:01,764
<i>He had an interesting</i>
<i>proposal for her</i>

310
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:05,001
- concerning her daughters.
- Hmm.

311
00:19:54,252 --> 00:19:57,420
- A girl.
- A wildling.

312
00:19:58,522 --> 00:19:59,856
We could question her.

313
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,858
You could.

314
00:20:01,893 --> 00:20:03,493
She won't answer.

315
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:06,997
I've known a wildling to bite off
his tongue instead of talking.

316
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:11,234
- What's your name?
- Ygritte.

317
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:14,337
She was reaching for this axe
when you got to her.

318
00:20:14,372 --> 00:20:18,108
Give her half a chance,
she'll bury it in your face.

319
00:20:18,142 --> 00:20:20,944
I gave you my name.

320
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:24,714
I'm Jon Snow.

321
00:20:31,187 --> 00:20:33,122
You ought to burn
them you killed.

322
00:20:33,157 --> 00:20:35,825
<i>We'd need a big</i>
<i>fire for that.</i>

323
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:39,863
Tell me, Ygritte,

324
00:20:39,897 --> 00:20:41,932
why do you want us
to build a big fire?

325
00:20:41,966 --> 00:20:45,203
Are there some more
friends in the area?

326
00:20:45,237 --> 00:20:48,573
Burn them or maybe you'll
need those swords again.

327
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:51,143
Our boy here's already
killed one dead man.

328
00:20:51,177 --> 00:20:53,578
He can do it again
if he has to.

329
00:20:53,612 --> 00:20:56,180
What waits
beyond the pass?

330
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:58,249
- The Free Folk.
- How many?

331
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:02,119
Hundreds and thousands.

332
00:21:02,154 --> 00:21:04,689
More than you've
ever seen, Crow.

333
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:08,125
Why come to the mountains?

334
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,096
What's in the frostfangs
your king could want?

335
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:21,040
Do you mean to march
on the Wall?

336
00:21:27,114 --> 00:21:29,283
Do you know
who I am, girl?

337
00:21:29,317 --> 00:21:31,819
Qhorin Halfhand.

338
00:21:31,853 --> 00:21:33,353
Tell me true.

339
00:21:33,388 --> 00:21:36,657
If your people captured me,

340
00:21:36,691 --> 00:21:38,659
would they take me prisoner?

341
00:21:38,693 --> 00:21:40,861
They'd take your head
off your shoulders

342
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:42,997
if they was feeling kind.

343
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:45,633
If not,
they'd kill you slow.

344
00:21:48,303 --> 00:21:50,671
We have no food for her.

345
00:21:50,705 --> 00:21:53,039
Can't spare a man
to watch her.

346
00:21:53,074 --> 00:21:56,309
Can't let her go. She'll bring
Mance Rayder's army down on us.

347
00:21:56,343 --> 00:21:58,277
It needs to be done.

348
00:21:58,311 --> 00:22:00,812
- Want me to do it?
- No.

349
00:22:00,847 --> 00:22:03,181
No, I'll do it.

350
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:06,884
Come, brothers.

351
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:09,019
We'll leave him to it.

352
00:22:09,053 --> 00:22:11,054
We'll meet you
at the top.

353
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:12,590
Don't take too long.

354
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,258
We're deep in
their country now.

355
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:30,775
You never killed
a woman before, did you?

356
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:33,611
You don't need
to do it.

357
00:22:33,646 --> 00:22:35,847
Mance would take you.
I know he would.

358
00:22:35,881 --> 00:22:38,283
There's secret ways.

359
00:22:38,317 --> 00:22:41,553
The Crows would
never catch us.

360
00:22:41,588 --> 00:22:44,756
I'm as much a Crow
as they are.

361
00:22:56,536 --> 00:22:58,604
Will you burn me...

362
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:00,639
after?

363
00:23:00,673 --> 00:23:03,175
Can't.

364
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:05,677
Someone might
see the smoke.

365
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,686
Strike hard and true,

366
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,921
Jon Snow,

367
00:23:15,956 --> 00:23:18,458
or I'll come back
and haunt you.

368
00:23:22,296 --> 00:23:25,232
That's cold.

369
00:23:27,435 --> 00:23:28,969
Go on.

370
00:23:29,004 --> 00:23:31,105
Be quick about it.

371
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,880
Do it.

372
00:23:43,184 --> 00:23:45,251
Bastard, do it!

373
00:25:00,628 --> 00:25:03,863
You can't do it.
We both know it.

374
00:25:08,368 --> 00:25:11,070
The sun's going
down, Jon Snow.

375
00:25:11,104 --> 00:25:14,240
And your friends
are nowhere close.

376
00:25:14,274 --> 00:25:15,641
I'll find them.

377
00:25:15,675 --> 00:25:19,344
Call for the
go on.

378
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:21,247
Call loudly.

379
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:30,688
<i>May the Seven guide</i>
<i>the princess on her journey.</i>

380
00:25:32,158 --> 00:25:33,991
<i>May the mother</i>
<i>give her health.</i>

381
00:25:34,026 --> 00:25:36,460
May the crone
give her wisdom.

382
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:39,463
May the warrior
give her courage.

383
00:25:44,535 --> 00:25:46,736
One day I pray
you love someone.

384
00:25:47,738 --> 00:25:50,439
I pray you love
her so much,

385
00:25:50,473 --> 00:25:52,875
<i>when you close your eyes,</i>
<i>you see her face.</i>

386
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:57,748
I want that for you.

387
00:25:57,782 --> 00:26:01,318
I want you to know what
it's like to love someone,

388
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:04,555
to truly love someone,

389
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:06,958
before I take her
from you.

390
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:27,277
You sound like a little cat mewling
for his mother.

391
00:26:27,311 --> 00:26:28,811
Princes don't cry.

392
00:26:28,845 --> 00:26:31,648
- I saw you cry.
- Did you say something, My Lady?

393
00:26:31,682 --> 00:26:34,952
My little brother cried
when I left Winterfell.

394
00:26:34,986 --> 00:26:37,021
So?

395
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:38,255
It seems a normal thing.

396
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,291
Is your little brother
a prince?

397
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:42,427
No.

398
00:26:42,461 --> 00:26:44,829
Not really relevant,
then, is it?

399
00:26:48,668 --> 00:26:50,703
Come, dog.

400
00:26:58,311 --> 00:27:00,144
<i>Hail, Joffrey!</i>

401
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,847
<i>Hail to the king.</i>

402
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:06,350
Seven blessings on you,
Your Grace.

403
00:27:06,384 --> 00:27:08,852
<i>Murderer! Bastard!</i>

404
00:27:08,886 --> 00:27:10,186
All hail the king.

405
00:27:10,221 --> 00:27:12,555
<i>He's no king.</i>
<i>He's a bastard!</i>

406
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:16,025
Please, Your Grace,
we're hungry.

407
00:27:18,896 --> 00:27:21,965
<i>- Freak!</i>
- Get the prince back to the keep now.

408
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:24,334
Yes, My Lord.
Come, quickly.

409
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:26,336
<i>Please, Your Grace,</i>
<i>give us some food!</i>

410
00:27:26,371 --> 00:27:29,206
<i>Bread, Your Grace,</i>
<i>please!</i>

411
00:27:32,144 --> 00:27:33,911
Who threw that?

412
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:35,913
<i>I want the man</i>
<i>who threw that.</i>

413
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:37,815
Find who did that
and bring him to me!

414
00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:39,150
- Hold on!
- <i>Hold them back!</i>

415
00:27:39,184 --> 00:27:41,686
<i>Just kill them!</i>
<i>Kill them all!</i>

416
00:27:47,426 --> 00:27:49,794
- Move. Move!
<i>- Pull back!</i>

417
00:27:49,829 --> 00:27:51,763
<i>Tear him to pieces!</i>

418
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:54,833
What are you doing?
I want these people executed!

419
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:57,168
And they want
the same for you.

420
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,627
Where's Sansa?

421
00:28:26,896 --> 00:28:28,964
<i>Through the door!</i>

422
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,966
<i>Come on!</i>

423
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,707
Protect the king!

424
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:40,476
- Get back!
- Fall back!

425
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,745
- Move!
- To the gates!

426
00:28:54,725 --> 00:28:57,994
- Come in! Come in!
- Keep him safe!

427
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:00,364
Motherfucker!

428
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:03,600
- Watch out. Hold them back.
- Come on.

429
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:13,110
Hey!

430
00:29:13,144 --> 00:29:14,878
Traitors!

431
00:29:14,912 --> 00:29:16,780
I'll have
all their heads.

432
00:29:16,814 --> 00:29:18,648
Oh, you blind,
bloody fool.

433
00:29:18,683 --> 00:29:20,617
You can't insult me.

434
00:29:20,651 --> 00:29:23,519
We've had vicious kings
and we've had idiot kings,

435
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,357
but I don't know if 
we've ever been cursed with

436
00:29:25,382 --> 00:29:26,489
a vicious idiot for a king.

437
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,257
- You can't--
- I can, I am.

438
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:29,792
They attacked me!

439
00:29:29,826 --> 00:29:33,329
They threw a cow pie at you,
so you decided to kill them all?

440
00:29:33,363 --> 00:29:35,132
They're starving,
you fool.

441
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:37,000
All because of a war
you started.

442
00:29:37,035 --> 00:29:39,536
You're talking to a king!

443
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:41,806
And now I've struck a king.

444
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,008
Did my hand fall
from my wrist?

445
00:29:44,043 --> 00:29:46,044
Where is the Stark girl?

446
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,613
Let them have her.

447
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:51,083
If she dies, you'll never
get your Uncle Jaime back.

448
00:29:51,117 --> 00:29:53,953
You owe him quite a bit,
you know.

449
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:04,330
Where are you going?

450
00:30:04,365 --> 00:30:08,134
You ever been fucked, little girl?

451
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:11,471
Come here.

452
00:30:11,506 --> 00:30:13,507
Take some men and go and find
the Stark girl.

453
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:15,475
I take my orders
from the king.

454
00:30:16,944 --> 00:30:19,213
<i>This way!</i>

455
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:27,356
Please!

456
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,157
No, no.

457
00:30:48,308 --> 00:30:49,875
Please!

458
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:54,580
You're all right now,
little bird.

459
00:30:54,615 --> 00:30:56,549
You're all right.

460
00:31:09,965 --> 00:31:13,968
<i>- We'll get you. We'll get you.</i>
<i>- This way.</i>

461
00:31:16,071 --> 00:31:17,571
Are you hurt,
My Lady?

462
00:31:17,606 --> 00:31:19,239
The little bird's
bleeding.

463
00:31:19,274 --> 00:31:21,007
Someone take her back
to her cage,

464
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:22,909
<i>see to that cut.</i>

465
00:31:22,943 --> 00:31:24,477
Well done, Clegane.

466
00:31:25,345 --> 00:31:27,480
I didn't do it for you.

467
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:31,216
He shouldn't
make me wait.

468
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:35,721
The Spice King is the second
wealthiest man in Qarth.

469
00:31:35,755 --> 00:31:37,889
He makes everyone wait.

470
00:31:37,924 --> 00:31:41,159
Of course, you could have
avoided this embarrassment

471
00:31:41,194 --> 00:31:43,662
if you married
the wealthiest man in Qarth.

472
00:31:43,696 --> 00:31:45,731
I already have a husband.

473
00:31:45,765 --> 00:31:48,100
Khal Drogo is gone,
Khaleesi.

474
00:31:48,134 --> 00:31:52,004
You are far too young
to be a widow forever

475
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:54,340
and far too beautiful.

476
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,142
And you are far too smart

477
00:31:56,176 --> 00:31:59,645
to think that I will
succumb to flattery.

478
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,614
I have travelled
very far in my life

479
00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:03,350
and met many women,

480
00:32:03,384 --> 00:32:05,185
but none that are
immune to flattery.

481
00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:07,921
- <i>The Mother of Dragons!</i>
- Ah.

482
00:32:07,956 --> 00:32:09,956
Here he comes.

483
00:32:09,991 --> 00:32:13,593
Forgive me. I had terrible
dreams last night.

484
00:32:13,628 --> 00:32:15,262
Terrible dreams.

485
00:32:15,296 --> 00:32:18,465
I could not sleep
until the sun was shining

486
00:32:18,499 --> 00:32:21,001
and the birds were singing.

487
00:32:21,035 --> 00:32:23,770
<i>Look what a beauty you are</i>

488
00:32:23,804 --> 00:32:26,372
<i>now the Red Waste</i>
<i>has been washed off you.</i>

489
00:32:26,407 --> 00:32:29,742
I am sorry about
all that unpleasantness.

490
00:32:29,776 --> 00:32:34,246
The silver hair
of a true Targaryen.

491
00:32:34,281 --> 00:32:37,717
Xaro Xhoan Daxos,
she is far too lovely

492
00:32:37,752 --> 00:32:40,287
for a glorified
dockworker like yourself.

493
00:32:40,321 --> 00:32:43,857
Very true, and yet they say
that your grandfather,

494
00:32:43,891 --> 00:32:45,959
who sold pepper
off the back of a wagon,

495
00:32:45,994 --> 00:32:49,396
married a lady far lovelier
and higher born than himself.

496
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:51,664
Every lady alive
was lovelier

497
00:32:51,699 --> 00:32:53,933
and higher born
than my grandfather.

498
00:32:53,968 --> 00:32:55,801
<i>Ahem.</i>

499
00:32:55,836 --> 00:32:59,371
Did my servants not offer you
something to eat, to drink?

500
00:32:59,406 --> 00:33:01,340
I'll have them flogged
in the square.

501
00:33:01,374 --> 00:33:03,308
Thank you, My Lord.
You are a gracious host,

502
00:33:03,343 --> 00:33:06,244
but there is no servant alive
that can bring me what I want.

503
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:09,080
Oh, she has a talent
for drama, this one.

504
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:13,218
So, my little princess,
what is it you want?

505
00:33:13,286 --> 00:33:14,686
My birthright--

506
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:16,622
the Seven Kingdoms
of Westeros.

507
00:33:16,656 --> 00:33:19,325
I fear I'm no better than
a servant in this regard.

508
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:21,427
I cannot give you
what I do not have.

509
00:33:21,462 --> 00:33:24,064
I'm not asking you
for the Kingdoms.

510
00:33:24,098 --> 00:33:25,866
I'm asking you
for ships.

511
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,535
I need to cross
the Narrow Sea.

512
00:33:27,569 --> 00:33:29,437
I need my ships as well.

513
00:33:29,471 --> 00:33:30,938
I use them, you see,

514
00:33:30,973 --> 00:33:33,441
to bring spices from
one port to another.

515
00:33:33,475 --> 00:33:34,975
Whatever you grant me
now will be repaid

516
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,779
three times over when
I retake the Iron Throne.

517
00:33:37,813 --> 00:33:39,247
Retake?

518
00:33:39,281 --> 00:33:41,415
Did you once sit
on the Iron Throne?

519
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:44,285
My father sat there
before he was murdered.

520
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:46,687
But if you did not
sit on it yourself,

521
00:33:46,722 --> 00:33:50,158
would it not be correct
to say take the Iron Throne?

522
00:33:50,192 --> 00:33:52,226
I didn't come here
to argue grammar.

523
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,129
Of course not.
You came to take my ships.

524
00:33:55,163 --> 00:33:57,731
So let me explain
my position,

525
00:33:57,766 --> 00:33:59,700
little princess.

526
00:33:59,735 --> 00:34:03,203
Unlike you, I do not
have exalted ancestors.

527
00:34:03,238 --> 00:34:05,206
I make my living by trade.

528
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,575
And I judge every trade
on its merits.

529
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,243
You ask for ships.

530
00:34:10,278 --> 00:34:13,313
You say I shall be
repaid triple.

531
00:34:13,347 --> 00:34:16,149
I do not doubt your honesty
or your intentions.

532
00:34:16,183 --> 00:34:18,418
But before you
repay your debts,

533
00:34:18,452 --> 00:34:21,053
you must seize
the Seven Kingdoms.

534
00:34:21,088 --> 00:34:23,755
- Do you have an army?
- Not yet.

535
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,257
You do not have an army.

536
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:27,392
Do you have powerful
allies in Westeros?

537
00:34:27,427 --> 00:34:29,561
There are many there
that support my claim.

538
00:34:29,596 --> 00:34:31,063
When were you
there last?

539
00:34:32,065 --> 00:34:33,699
I left when
I was a baby.

540
00:34:33,734 --> 00:34:36,636
So, in truth,
you have no allies.

541
00:34:36,671 --> 00:34:39,426
The people will rise
to fight for their rightful

542
00:34:39,451 --> 00:34:41,141
Queen when I return.

543
00:34:41,142 --> 00:34:43,010
Ah.

544
00:34:43,044 --> 00:34:44,812
Forgive me,
little princess,

545
00:34:44,846 --> 00:34:48,283
but I cannot make an investment
based on wishes and dreams.

546
00:34:48,317 --> 00:34:49,784
Now if you'll pardon me.

547
00:34:49,819 --> 00:34:52,520
Do you know Illyrio Mopatis,
Magister of Pentos?

548
00:34:52,555 --> 00:34:55,190
Yes, we've met.
A shrewd man.

549
00:34:55,224 --> 00:34:58,826
For my wedding he gave me
three petrified dragon eggs.

550
00:34:58,861 --> 00:35:01,729
<i>He believed--</i>
<i>the world believed--</i>

551
00:35:01,763 --> 00:35:03,697
that the ages
had turned them to stone.

552
00:35:03,732 --> 00:35:06,934
How many centuries has it been
since dragons roamed the skies?

553
00:35:06,968 --> 00:35:09,936
But I dreamt that
if I carried those eggs

554
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,439
into a great fire,
they would hatch.

555
00:35:12,473 --> 00:35:17,011
When I stepped into the fire,
my own people thought I was mad.

556
00:35:17,045 --> 00:35:19,213
But when the fire
burned out,

557
00:35:19,248 --> 00:35:21,449
I was unhurt,

558
00:35:21,483 --> 00:35:24,319
the Mother of Dragons.

559
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:29,157
Do you understand?

560
00:35:31,728 --> 00:35:34,296
I'm no ordinary woman.

561
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:37,298
My dreams come true.

562
00:35:42,071 --> 00:35:44,338
I admire your passion.

563
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,243
But in business, I trust
in logic, not passion.

564
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:50,944
I'm sorry, little princess.

565
00:35:50,978 --> 00:35:53,313
I am not
your little princess.

566
00:35:53,347 --> 00:35:56,383
I am Daenerys Stormborn
of the blood of old Valyria

567
00:35:56,417 --> 00:35:58,419
and I will take
what is mine.

568
00:35:58,453 --> 00:36:01,555
With fire and blood,
I will take it.

569
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:05,159
Yes, My Lady,
but not with my ships.

570
00:36:22,576 --> 00:36:25,712
Who taught you to read?

571
00:36:25,746 --> 00:36:28,014
My father, My Lord.

572
00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:30,017
Hmm.

573
00:36:30,051 --> 00:36:32,252
I taught my son
Jaime to read.

574
00:36:35,256 --> 00:36:37,257
The Maester came
to me one day,

575
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:39,459
told me he wasn't learning.

576
00:36:39,494 --> 00:36:42,262
He couldn't make sense
of the letters.

577
00:36:42,297 --> 00:36:44,999
He reversed them
in his head.

578
00:36:45,033 --> 00:36:47,869
The Maester said he'd heard
tell of this affliction

579
00:36:47,903 --> 00:36:49,938
and that we simply
must accept it.

580
00:36:49,972 --> 00:36:52,040
Ha!

581
00:36:52,075 --> 00:36:55,544
After that,
I sat Jaime down

582
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:58,748
for four hours every day
until he learned.

583
00:36:58,782 --> 00:37:03,987
He hated me for it,
for a time.

584
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:06,657
For a long time,

585
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:08,526
but he learned.

586
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:16,400
Where is your father?
Is he alive?

587
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,904
Who was he?

588
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,540
A stonemason.

589
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,874
A stonemason
who could read?

590
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:28,310
- Hmm.
- He taught himself.

591
00:37:28,344 --> 00:37:31,079
Quite a man.

592
00:37:32,114 --> 00:37:34,416
What killed him?

593
00:37:36,018 --> 00:37:38,152
Loyalty.

594
00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:41,857
You're a sharp
little thing, aren't you?

595
00:37:45,228 --> 00:37:46,528
Did...

596
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:51,667
Forgive me, My Lord.
I shouldn't ask questions.

597
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,937
No...

598
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:57,874
But you've already begun.

599
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:01,344
Did you know
your father, My Lord?

600
00:38:01,378 --> 00:38:03,513
I did.

601
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,717
I grew up with him.

602
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,589
I watched him
grow old.

603
00:38:15,161 --> 00:38:16,862
<i>He loved us.</i>

604
00:38:16,896 --> 00:38:19,698
He was a good man,

605
00:38:19,733 --> 00:38:22,434
but a weak man,

606
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:25,971
a weak man who nearly destroyed
our House and name.

607
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:30,376
I'm cold.

608
00:38:30,411 --> 00:38:33,112
I'll fetch more wood
for the fire, My Lord.

609
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:35,515
Mmm.

610
00:39:01,976 --> 00:39:03,643
Where are you going, girl?

611
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:06,613
The armory,
My Lord.

612
00:39:06,648 --> 00:39:08,249
Why?

613
00:39:08,283 --> 00:39:10,117
Lord Tywin sent me.

614
00:39:12,087 --> 00:39:14,355
What might this be?

615
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:17,291
Lord Tywin gave it to me.

616
00:39:17,325 --> 00:39:19,393
What for?

617
00:39:19,427 --> 00:39:22,262
To take to the armory.

618
00:39:22,297 --> 00:39:24,798
Why would he do that?

619
00:39:26,768 --> 00:39:28,402
Let's go and ask him.

620
00:39:31,005 --> 00:39:33,307
Move!

621
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:37,278
Get out of the way!

622
00:40:06,942 --> 00:40:08,876
Amory Lorch.

623
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,911
A girl has named
a second name.

624
00:40:10,946 --> 00:40:12,513
A man will do
what must be done.

625
00:40:12,547 --> 00:40:14,482
Now!

626
00:40:14,516 --> 00:40:18,386
A girl cannot tell a man when
exactly he must do a thing.

627
00:40:18,421 --> 00:40:20,689
A man cannot make a thing
happen before its time.

628
00:40:20,723 --> 00:40:22,658
But he's going to tell Tywin.
He's getting away.

629
00:40:22,692 --> 00:40:25,694
It has to be now.

630
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,970
Guard!

631
00:40:44,247 --> 00:40:46,581
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

632
00:40:50,453 --> 00:40:52,987
My honor, Your Grace.

633
00:40:53,022 --> 00:40:55,456
Your Grace.

634
00:41:00,529 --> 00:41:03,063
- Your Grace.
- Quent.

635
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,887
Lady Talisa.

636
00:41:26,889 --> 00:41:28,490
Your Grace.

637
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,061
I'm not sure I'm a lady.

638
00:41:32,095 --> 00:41:34,229
Westerosi customs are still
a bit foreign to me.

639
00:41:34,264 --> 00:41:36,665
It's hard to keep
all the rules straight.

640
00:41:36,699 --> 00:41:39,801
But if I remember
my lessons,

641
00:41:39,836 --> 00:41:42,370
a woman of noble birth
is always called a lady

642
00:41:42,405 --> 00:41:44,905
unless she's a queen
or a princess.

643
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,140
I could find
someone who knows.

644
00:41:47,175 --> 00:41:49,743
Why are you so sure
I'm of noble birth?

645
00:41:49,777 --> 00:41:51,811
Because it's obvious.

646
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:55,481
What if I told you my father
sold lace on the long bridge

647
00:41:55,516 --> 00:41:58,451
and my mother, my brother, and I lived
with him above our shop?

648
00:41:59,953 --> 00:42:01,320
I'd call you a liar.

649
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:04,757
Not very noble to accuse
a lady of dishonesty.

650
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:10,896
I always thought
I was a brilliant liar.

651
00:42:11,998 --> 00:42:14,299
Better at amputations,
I'm afraid.

652
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:20,972
Quite a pretty spot.

653
00:42:21,006 --> 00:42:23,641
Will we be here long?

654
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:26,410
I couldn't really discuss
troop movements with you.

655
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:28,879
I'm not a spy.

656
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:31,981
Of course a spy
would deny being a spy.

657
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,819
You're right.
You've found me out.

658
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,587
I'm writing a letter
to the Lannisters.

659
00:42:37,622 --> 00:42:40,057
"The young wolf
is on the move."

660
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,795
Perhaps you'd join me...

661
00:42:45,298 --> 00:42:48,100
If you've got time,
of course, for, well...

662
00:42:48,134 --> 00:42:50,436
Robb.

663
00:42:51,604 --> 00:42:53,739
Mother.

664
00:42:59,512 --> 00:43:02,381
Mother, this is
Lady Talisa.

665
00:43:02,415 --> 00:43:04,683
She's been helping
with the wounded.

666
00:43:04,717 --> 00:43:07,619
She's been very...
helpful.

667
00:43:07,653 --> 00:43:09,187
Lady Talisa.

668
00:43:09,221 --> 00:43:10,888
Lady Stark.

669
00:43:10,923 --> 00:43:12,756
Lady Talisa...?

670
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:16,360
- Maegyr.
- Maegyr?

671
00:43:16,395 --> 00:43:19,330
Forgive me,
I do not know this name.

672
00:43:19,365 --> 00:43:22,434
An uncommon name here.
An old name in Volantis.

673
00:43:23,503 --> 00:43:26,639
Excuse me, My Lady.
Your Grace.

674
00:43:35,216 --> 00:43:36,884
I've missed you.

675
00:43:36,918 --> 00:43:40,321
Yes, you look
positively forlorn.

676
00:43:40,355 --> 00:43:43,190
You surprised me,
that's all.

677
00:43:43,225 --> 00:43:46,394
I didn't think
I'd see you today.

678
00:43:46,428 --> 00:43:48,796
I wish that you were free
to follow your heart.

679
00:43:48,831 --> 00:43:50,264
I know.

680
00:43:50,299 --> 00:43:52,967
You have inherited your
father's responsibilities.

681
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:55,803
I'm afraid they come
at a cost.

682
00:43:55,837 --> 00:43:59,240
- I know.
- You are promised to another--

683
00:44:00,142 --> 00:44:03,744
a debt that must be paid.

684
00:44:03,779 --> 00:44:06,147
- I haven't forgotten.
- Your Grace.

685
00:44:06,182 --> 00:44:09,918
My Lady.
News from Winterfell.

686
00:44:22,298 --> 00:44:25,100
Your brothers desert you?

687
00:44:25,134 --> 00:44:27,368
I can tell you
which way to go.

688
00:44:27,403 --> 00:44:30,038
We'll stop here.

689
00:44:30,072 --> 00:44:32,040
Too dark to go
any farther today.

690
00:44:32,074 --> 00:44:34,976
Here? There's no
shelter here.

691
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:36,411
There's no shelter
anywhere.

692
00:44:36,445 --> 00:44:39,181
There is if you know
where to look.

693
00:44:42,618 --> 00:44:44,586
The cold
could kill us both.

694
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,621
- If you light a fire--
- No fire.

695
00:44:46,655 --> 00:44:49,457
- But a fire is--
- No fire.

696
00:44:52,094 --> 00:44:54,262
Have it your way.

697
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:03,772
We'll stay warmer
if we stay close.

698
00:45:05,742 --> 00:45:08,310
Bet you freeze to death
before I do.

699
00:45:10,147 --> 00:45:12,582
Bet your life.

700
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:39,176
Think they're out
looking for you?

701
00:45:40,578 --> 00:45:43,347
- Yes.
- Think they'll find you?

702
00:45:43,382 --> 00:45:45,583
Yes.

703
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,321
You're brave.

704
00:45:51,357 --> 00:45:53,190
Stupid,

705
00:45:53,225 --> 00:45:55,126
but brave.

706
00:45:57,763 --> 00:46:01,032
We start again at first light.
Get some sleep.

707
00:46:17,082 --> 00:46:18,849
Stop moving.

708
00:46:18,884 --> 00:46:22,554
I'm just trying
to get comfortable.

709
00:46:22,588 --> 00:46:24,456
Stop it!

710
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:39,371
- <i>You're still moving.</i>
- Was I?

711
00:46:39,405 --> 00:46:42,007
I didn't notice
that time.

712
00:46:53,084 --> 00:46:54,819
This cannot be true.

713
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,554
<i>We've had ravens</i>
<i>from White Harbor,</i>

714
00:46:56,588 --> 00:46:58,790
Barrowton
and the Dreadfort.

715
00:46:58,824 --> 00:47:00,825
I'm afraid it is true.

716
00:47:01,727 --> 00:47:03,628
Why?
Why would Theon--

717
00:47:03,663 --> 00:47:05,898
Because the Greyjoys
are treasonous whores.

718
00:47:05,932 --> 00:47:08,601
- <i>My brothers?</i>
- We've heard nothing of them.

719
00:47:10,571 --> 00:47:12,873
But Rodrik Cassel is dead.

720
00:47:15,276 --> 00:47:17,577
I told you,
never trust a Greyjoy!

721
00:47:20,582 --> 00:47:22,716
I must go North at once.

722
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,885
There's still a war
to win, Your Grace.

723
00:47:24,919 --> 00:47:27,387
How can I call myself king
if I can't hold my own castle?

724
00:47:27,421 --> 00:47:28,923
How can I ask men
to follow me if I can't--

725
00:47:28,948 --> 00:47:30,657
You are a king.

726
00:47:30,658 --> 00:47:33,493
And that means you don't have
to do everything yourself.

727
00:47:33,528 --> 00:47:35,329
Let me go
and talk to Theon.

728
00:47:35,363 --> 00:47:38,266
There will be no talk.
He will die for this.

729
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,569
Theon holds the castle
with a skeleton crew.

730
00:47:41,603 --> 00:47:43,938
Let me send word to
my bastard at the Dreadfort.

731
00:47:43,972 --> 00:47:48,176
He can raise a few hundred men and
retake Winterfell before the new moon.

732
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:51,312
We have the Lannisters
on the run.

733
00:47:51,347 --> 00:47:55,984
If you march all the way back north
now, you'll lose what you gained.

734
00:47:56,018 --> 00:47:59,655
My boy would be honored to
bring you Prince Theon's head.

735
00:47:59,689 --> 00:48:04,293
Tell your son Bran and Rickon's
safety is paramount.

736
00:48:04,327 --> 00:48:07,329
And Theon-- I want him
brought to me alive.

737
00:48:08,865 --> 00:48:11,333
I want to look him
in the eye and ask him why.

738
00:48:11,368 --> 00:48:13,969
And then I'll take
his head myself.

739
00:48:14,004 --> 00:48:17,873
Why on earth would I trust the word
of a lying little savage like you?

740
00:48:17,907 --> 00:48:19,808
I'm no liar.

741
00:48:20,944 --> 00:48:22,878
All wildlings
are liars and savages

742
00:48:22,912 --> 00:48:24,747
with no loyalty
to anything or anyone.

743
00:48:24,781 --> 00:48:27,116
I done what I had
to do to stay alive.

744
00:48:27,151 --> 00:48:30,019
I hate the Starks
as well as you do.

745
00:48:30,053 --> 00:48:33,356
Let me serve you,
My Lord.

746
00:48:33,391 --> 00:48:36,193
How? And don't tell me
to put a spear in your hand.

747
00:48:36,227 --> 00:48:38,695
There are other ways
to serve, My Lord.

748
00:48:38,729 --> 00:48:41,264
I'm a prince now,
and you'd do well--

749
00:48:41,299 --> 00:48:44,201
There are other ways
to serve, my prince.

750
00:48:48,674 --> 00:48:50,309
Like what?

751
00:48:52,845 --> 00:48:55,648
We know things,
the Free people.

752
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:58,250
You know things?

753
00:48:58,285 --> 00:49:00,186
Like what?

754
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,488
How to eat dirt?

755
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:05,524
Other things.

756
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:09,294
Savage things.

757
00:49:11,297 --> 00:49:13,131
Wait outside.

758
00:49:30,047 --> 00:49:32,249
I always wondered
what you had under there.

759
00:49:32,283 --> 00:49:35,285
It comes at a price.

760
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:37,587
I'm not killing you.
That's your price.

761
00:49:37,622 --> 00:49:39,189
I already had that.

762
00:49:40,725 --> 00:49:42,192
What do you want, then,

763
00:49:42,226 --> 00:49:44,828
other than
your miserable life?

764
00:49:44,862 --> 00:49:46,964
What all free people want--

765
00:49:46,998 --> 00:49:49,133
my freedom.

766
00:49:54,005 --> 00:49:55,874
Well, you shall
have it, then.

767
00:49:58,143 --> 00:50:00,745
But only if you
serve me well.

768
00:50:06,685 --> 00:50:08,553
- Ow.
- Shh.

769
00:50:08,587 --> 00:50:11,656
- It's not deep.
- I thought they were going to kill me.

770
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:13,224
They thought so, too.

771
00:50:13,258 --> 00:50:15,894
He hated me,
the man who hit me.

772
00:50:15,928 --> 00:50:18,496
I saw it in his eyes.
Hated me.

773
00:50:18,531 --> 00:50:20,331
He never met me before,

774
00:50:20,366 --> 00:50:23,334
but he wanted
to hurt me.

775
00:50:23,368 --> 00:50:26,404
- Of course he did.
- Why? Why would a stranger--

776
00:50:26,438 --> 00:50:28,706
you are everything
he will never have.

777
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,875
Your horse eats better
than his children.

778
00:50:30,909 --> 00:50:34,245
It doesn't matter now.
He's dead.

779
00:50:34,279 --> 00:50:37,148
I would have given them
bread if I had it.

780
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,784
I hate the King
more than any of them.

781
00:50:39,819 --> 00:50:41,653
Don't say these things.

782
00:50:41,687 --> 00:50:42,954
If the wrong
people hear you--

783
00:50:42,988 --> 00:50:45,290
But you're not
the wrong people.

784
00:50:50,696 --> 00:50:52,864
Don't trust anybody.

785
00:50:52,898 --> 00:50:55,466
Life is safer
that way.

786
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:39,145
And where
are you going?

787
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,949
I have something for you
from Prince Theon.

788
00:51:42,983 --> 00:51:45,818
- What?
- Me.

789
00:51:48,222 --> 00:51:51,024
He says I'm to make
the rounds.

790
00:51:57,165 --> 00:51:59,666
And keep you warm.

791
00:52:26,694 --> 00:52:30,030
The Spice King refuses me
because I'm a bad investment.

792
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:31,706
The Silk King won't support me

793
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,731
because of his business with
the Lannisters.

794
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,702
Why offend
his best customer?

795
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:39,105
And the Copper King
offers me a single ship

796
00:52:39,139 --> 00:52:42,508
on the condition that I lie
with him for a night.

797
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:45,510
Does he think I will
whore myself for a boat?

798
00:52:45,545 --> 00:52:49,046
When I came to this city,
I had nothing.

799
00:52:49,081 --> 00:52:51,582
Truly nothing.

800
00:52:51,616 --> 00:52:53,684
I slept by the docks.

801
00:52:53,718 --> 00:52:56,453
And when I could find work
loading the ships, I would eat.

802
00:52:56,488 --> 00:52:59,523
If not,
I dreamed of food.

803
00:52:59,557 --> 00:53:02,559
Today I am the richest
man in Qarth.

804
00:53:02,594 --> 00:53:05,028
Do you think the path
from poverty to wealth

805
00:53:05,062 --> 00:53:07,430
is always pure
and honorable?

806
00:53:07,464 --> 00:53:11,100
I have done
many things, Khaleesi,

807
00:53:11,134 --> 00:53:13,636
that a righteous man
would condemn.

808
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:17,240
And here I am,
with no regrets.

809
00:53:30,089 --> 00:53:33,725
Bar the gates.
Ring the bells.

810
00:53:33,759 --> 00:53:36,427
Slowly, Khaleesi.

811
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:48,137
<i>Where are they?</i>

812
00:53:54,545 --> 00:53:57,247
Where are my dragons?!
