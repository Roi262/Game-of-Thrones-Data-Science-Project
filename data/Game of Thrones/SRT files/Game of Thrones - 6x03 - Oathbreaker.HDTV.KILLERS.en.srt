00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:03,141
Easy, easy.

3
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:04,776
Easy.

4
00:03:11,822 --> 00:03:13,289
What do you remember?

5
00:03:20,298 --> 00:03:22,465
They stabbed me.

6
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:28,771
Olly...

7
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,008
he put a knife in my heart.

8
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:41,216
I shouldn't be here.

9
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:45,521
The lady brought you back.

10
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:49,358
Afterwards, after they stabbed you,

11
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,627
after you died, where did you go?

12
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:53,663
What did you see?

13
00:03:58,102 --> 00:03:59,902
Nothing.

14
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,674
There was nothing at all.

15
00:04:08,946 --> 00:04:11,747
The Lord let you come back for a reason.

16
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:16,352
Stannis was not the
prince who was promised,

17
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:18,053
but someone has to be.

18
00:04:22,627 --> 00:04:24,760
Could you give us a moment?

19
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:47,883
You were dead.

20
00:04:47,985 --> 00:04:49,685
And now you're not.

21
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:55,023
That's completely fucking
mad, seems to me.

22
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,560
I can only imagine how it seems to you.

23
00:04:59,897 --> 00:05:02,231
I did what I thought was right.

24
00:05:04,635 --> 00:05:06,369
And I got murdered for it.

25
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:09,705
And now I'm back.

26
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:11,206
Why?

27
00:05:11,308 --> 00:05:12,908
I don't know.

28
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,411
Maybe we'll never know.

29
00:05:15,513 --> 00:05:17,480
What does it matter?

30
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:21,250
You go on.

31
00:05:23,053 --> 00:05:25,554
You fight for as long as you can.

32
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:28,557
You clean up as much of
the shit as you can.

33
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:31,594
I don't know how to do that.

34
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:35,330
I thought I did, but...

35
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,136
I failed.

36
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:46,174
Good.

37
00:05:46,277 --> 00:05:47,777
Now go fail again.

38
00:06:44,268 --> 00:06:46,535
They think you're some kind of god.

39
00:06:46,637 --> 00:06:49,438
The man who returned from the dead.

40
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,106
I'm not a god.

41
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,909
I know that.

42
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,412
I saw your pecker.

43
00:06:57,515 --> 00:07:00,415
What kind of god would
have a pecker that small?

44
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:28,744
Your eyes are still brown.

45
00:07:28,846 --> 00:07:30,613
Is that still you in there?

46
00:07:30,715 --> 00:07:32,615
I think so.

47
00:07:35,152 --> 00:07:37,853
Hold off on burning my body for now.

48
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,357
That's funny.

49
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:46,228
You sure that's still you in there?

50
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:19,662
You all right?

51
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:22,397
Yes. Yes, I'm fine.

52
00:08:25,436 --> 00:08:29,171
Did I ever tell you I used to
think the sea was called the see

53
00:08:29,273 --> 00:08:32,207
because it was nothing but water
as far as the eye could see?

54
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,609
I don't think so.

55
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:36,111
Sea, see.

56
00:08:36,213 --> 00:08:39,014
They're spelled different,
but they sound the same.

57
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:42,117
Yeah, they do.

58
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:45,187
It was before I learned
how to read, obviously.

59
00:08:48,392 --> 00:08:51,460
Sam, are you going to be sick?

60
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,944
Won't be long. We'll
be in the south soon.

61
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:11,080
I'm excited to see Oldtown.

62
00:09:11,181 --> 00:09:16,685
Captain says it's the most
beautiful city in Westeros.

63
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:20,188
Are you going to vomit again?

64
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,491
No. No, no, no. I'm...

65
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:26,795
The Citadel doesn't admit women.

66
00:09:26,897 --> 00:09:29,965
There won't be a place for
you there or for Little Sam.

67
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:33,502
I stayed at Castle Black.
There's no women allowed there.

68
00:09:33,604 --> 00:09:35,671
The Citadel isn't Castle Black.

69
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:40,750
I don't have a Jon Snow or Maester
Aemon to help me bend the rules.

70
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:44,013
I'll stay in Oldtown, then.

71
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:45,781
By yourself?

72
00:09:45,883 --> 00:09:47,582
With a baby and no money?

73
00:09:48,853 --> 00:09:50,953
So if we're not going to Oldtown,

74
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:52,220
where are you taking me?

75
00:09:53,624 --> 00:09:55,958
To my home.

76
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,325
Horn Hill.

77
00:09:59,496 --> 00:10:01,897
My father's... well, my father,

78
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:05,567
but my mother's a kind woman
and my sister's lovely.

79
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,370
They'll take care of you both.

80
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,740
"Wherever you go, I go, too."

81
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:13,575
That's what you said.

82
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,228
I said that because I want you
and Little Sam to be safe.

83
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,597
That's all I want...

84
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,234
to become a maester so I can
help Jon when the time comes

85
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:40,969
so you'll be safe.

86
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:42,671
Us and everyone else in the world.

87
00:10:42,773 --> 00:10:44,907
I don't care about them.

88
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:48,911
Well, no, I do, but I don't really.

89
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:52,414
I care about you and him.

90
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,885
I know that, Sam.

91
00:10:56,987 --> 00:10:59,221
And he does, too.

92
00:11:02,426 --> 00:11:04,492
You're the only one who ever has.

93
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:15,704
If you think it's for the best,

94
00:11:15,806 --> 00:11:18,440
we trust you.

95
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:21,443
I'd feel better if you threw
something at me and stormed off.

96
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:25,013
I'd never do that to
the father of my son.

97
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:25,107
That's my father.

98
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:27,609
The man beside him is Howland Reed,

99
00:12:27,711 --> 00:12:29,244
Meera's father.

100
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:42,791
Ser Arthur Dayne.

101
00:12:42,893 --> 00:12:45,027
The Sword of the Morning.

102
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:47,896
Father said he was the best
swordsman he ever saw.

103
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,046
Lord Stark.

104
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:07,349
I looked for you on the Trident.

105
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:09,417
We weren't there.

106
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,086
Your friend the usurper

107
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:14,156
would lie beneath the
ground if we had been.

108
00:13:14,258 --> 00:13:16,291
The Mad King is dead.

109
00:13:16,393 --> 00:13:18,460
Rhaegar lies beneath the ground.

110
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:20,963
Why weren't you there
to protect your prince?

111
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:22,965
Our prince wanted us here.

112
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,374
Where's my sister?

113
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:37,645
I wish you good fortune
in the wars to come.

114
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:47,122
And now it begins.

115
00:13:51,661 --> 00:13:53,728
No.

116
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,764
Now it ends.

117
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:34,963
He's better than my father.

118
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:36,598
Far better.

119
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:43,671
But Father beat him.

120
00:15:43,773 --> 00:15:45,840
Did he?

121
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:47,909
I know he did.

122
00:15:48,012 --> 00:15:49,677
Heard the story a thousand times.

123
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:09,597
He stabbed him in the back.

124
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,352
What's in the tower?

125
00:16:30,454 --> 00:16:32,154
That's enough for one day.

126
00:16:32,256 --> 00:16:33,955
We'll visit again another time.

127
00:16:34,058 --> 00:16:36,624
- I want to see where he's going.
- Time to go.

128
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:39,394
Father!

129
00:17:05,822 --> 00:17:07,489
Why did you do that?

130
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:09,657
Take me back there. I want to go back.

131
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,025
No.

132
00:17:13,263 --> 00:17:15,630
- He heard me.
- Maybe.

133
00:17:15,732 --> 00:17:19,033
- Maybe he heard the wind.
- He heard me.

134
00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:22,137
The past is already written.
The ink is dry.

135
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:24,539
What's in that tower?

136
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:25,974
I want to go back there.

137
00:17:26,076 --> 00:17:28,843
I've told you many times, stay too long

138
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:31,379
where you don't belong and
you will never return.

139
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:33,281
Why do I want to return?

140
00:17:33,383 --> 00:17:35,150
So I can be a cripple again?

141
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:37,685
So I can talk to an old man in a tree?

142
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:39,821
You think I wanted to sit
here for 1,000 years

143
00:17:39,923 --> 00:17:41,789
watching the world from a distance

144
00:17:41,891 --> 00:17:43,291
as the roots grew through me?

145
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:45,059
So why did you?

146
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,962
I was waiting for you.

147
00:17:48,064 --> 00:17:49,831
I don't want to be you.

148
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,567
I don't blame you.

149
00:17:53,903 --> 00:17:56,138
You won't be here forever.

150
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,840
You won't be an old man in a tree.

151
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:01,376
But before you leave,

152
00:18:01,478 --> 00:18:04,446
you must learn.

153
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:06,381
Learn what?

154
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:09,083
Everything.

155
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:33,250

00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:48,164
_

191
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:50,975
_

192
00:22:02,586 --> 00:22:05,587
I don't know how you stand
it in all that leather.

193
00:22:12,763 --> 00:22:14,662
If we could have the room.

194
00:22:25,108 --> 00:22:27,809
You look lovely today, my dear.
You really do.

195
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:32,280
How you climbed all those steps
without breaking a sweat.

196
00:22:32,382 --> 00:22:33,548
If you're going to torture me,

197
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,750
just call them back and get on with it.

198
00:22:35,852 --> 00:22:37,919
I am not a torturer.

199
00:22:39,355 --> 00:22:42,791
Though it so often is
what people deserve.

200
00:22:43,993 --> 00:22:46,728
And it does provide answers.

201
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,697
But they're usually the wrong answers.

202
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,301
My job is to find the right answers.

203
00:22:53,403 --> 00:22:55,503
Do you know how I do that?

204
00:22:55,605 --> 00:22:58,873
I do it by making people happy.

205
00:22:58,975 --> 00:23:01,609
I'd like to make you happy, Vala.

206
00:23:01,711 --> 00:23:04,913
That's your name, isn't it, Vala?

207
00:23:05,014 --> 00:23:07,315
That's all right.

208
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:10,552
I know who you are and what you've done.

209
00:23:12,422 --> 00:23:13,721
You've done a lot.

210
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:16,290
You've sacrificed your body for a cause,

211
00:23:16,392 --> 00:23:19,727
which is more than most people do.

212
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,931
And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy

213
00:23:23,032 --> 00:23:25,800
murder the Unsullied
and the Second Sons.

214
00:23:25,902 --> 00:23:29,236
The Unsullied and the Second
Sons are foreign soldiers

215
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:31,372
brought here by a foreign queen

216
00:23:31,475 --> 00:23:34,175
to destroy our city and our history.

217
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:37,111
I understand.

218
00:23:37,213 --> 00:23:39,881
Well, that makes perfect sense

219
00:23:39,983 --> 00:23:42,717
from your perspective.

220
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:46,588
I have a different
perspective, of course.

221
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:50,157
I think it's important that you try
to see things from my perspective

222
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:52,627
just as I will try to
see them from yours.

223
00:23:52,729 --> 00:23:54,929
Because that is the only way

224
00:23:55,031 --> 00:23:57,932
that I can make you and Dom happy.

225
00:24:01,037 --> 00:24:04,839
That is how you pronounce it... Dom?

226
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:07,942
I'm afraid I don't really
speak the language.

227
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:11,379
Such a handsome boy.

228
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:15,016
Those big, brown eyes. Good
luck keeping the ladies away.

229
00:24:15,118 --> 00:24:19,253
Yes, you're a true
liberator, aren't you?

230
00:24:19,355 --> 00:24:22,223
You won't torture me, you'll
just threaten my son.

231
00:24:22,325 --> 00:24:24,759
Children are blameless.

232
00:24:25,795 --> 00:24:27,996
I have never hurt them.

233
00:24:28,097 --> 00:24:30,431
Your boy is in no immediate danger,

234
00:24:30,534 --> 00:24:32,099
this I swear to you.

235
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,970
But between us, dear,

236
00:24:36,072 --> 00:24:39,206
you did conspire to kill
the queen's soldiers.

237
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:41,876
We both know the penalty for that crime.

238
00:24:46,983 --> 00:24:50,652
How will poor Dom get
on without his mother?

239
00:24:50,754 --> 00:24:52,787
And with his breathing problem.

240
00:24:52,889 --> 00:24:55,222
If I tell you anything, they'll kill me.

241
00:24:55,324 --> 00:24:57,491
So either you kill me or they do.

242
00:24:57,594 --> 00:25:01,128
Yes, from your perspective,
this is a problem.

243
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,699
There is a third option, though.

244
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:08,002
A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.

245
00:25:08,104 --> 00:25:12,740
I've already booked passage for
a woman and her young son.

246
00:25:12,842 --> 00:25:16,277
I'll even throw in a bag of
silver to help you start again.

247
00:25:16,379 --> 00:25:18,145
Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask

248
00:25:18,247 --> 00:25:21,950
one of our leather-clad
friends back in to carry it.

249
00:25:22,052 --> 00:25:23,751
Far too heavy for me.

250
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:26,988
The boat sails at dawn.

251
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,857
You need to decide now.

252
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,727
A new life for you and Dom

253
00:25:32,829 --> 00:25:34,462
or...

254
00:25:50,513 --> 00:25:52,313
What should we do while we wait?

255
00:25:52,415 --> 00:25:54,215
To pass the time, what should we do?

256
00:25:54,317 --> 00:25:56,651
What should we talk about?

257
00:25:58,989 --> 00:26:00,755
You speak 19 languages.

258
00:26:00,857 --> 00:26:04,191
You must occasionally use some
of them to talk about things.

259
00:26:04,293 --> 00:26:07,528
You two, you spend a great
deal of time together.

260
00:26:07,631 --> 00:26:10,798
What would you be talking
about if I weren't here?

261
00:26:11,868 --> 00:26:13,835
Patrol.

262
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:16,570
When I am going on patrol
with the Unsullied.

263
00:26:16,673 --> 00:26:19,240
What we see on patrol.

264
00:26:19,342 --> 00:26:21,275
Who we captured on patrol.

265
00:26:21,377 --> 00:26:23,845
That's good. That's very good.

266
00:26:25,949 --> 00:26:28,349
But that's a report.

267
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:30,652
I was thinking more of a conversation.

268
00:26:30,754 --> 00:26:33,788
A wise man once said the
true history of the world

269
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:37,291
is the history of great
conversations in elegant rooms.

270
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:39,293
Who said this?

271
00:26:39,395 --> 00:26:41,763
Me.

272
00:26:41,865 --> 00:26:43,831
Just now.

273
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:52,406
All right, no conversations.

274
00:26:52,508 --> 00:26:54,375
Let's play a game.

275
00:26:57,246 --> 00:26:59,013
You don't play games,
either one of you, ever?

276
00:26:59,115 --> 00:27:00,347
Games are for children.

277
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:04,452
My master Kraznys would
sometimes make us play games.

278
00:27:04,453 --> 00:27:06,187
There, that's a start.

279
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:09,957
- Only the girls.
- No, no, no.

280
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,026
Not that. Of course not that.

281
00:27:13,396 --> 00:27:15,629
Innocent games. Fun games.

282
00:27:15,732 --> 00:27:17,231
Drinking games.

283
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,533
We do not drink.

284
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:21,635
Until you do.

285
00:27:23,372 --> 00:27:25,506
All right. No drinking.

286
00:27:25,608 --> 00:27:27,141
We can play without drinking.

287
00:27:27,243 --> 00:27:29,410
It's a wonderful game. I invented it.

288
00:27:29,512 --> 00:27:31,012
Here's how it works.

289
00:27:31,114 --> 00:27:33,081
I make a statement about your past.

290
00:27:33,183 --> 00:27:34,816
If I'm wrong, I drink.

291
00:27:34,918 --> 00:27:38,019
And if I'm right...

292
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:41,522
maybe we can't play without drinking.

293
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:45,760
Oh, you took your time.

294
00:27:45,862 --> 00:27:47,829
Sorry.

295
00:27:47,931 --> 00:27:51,565
I was busy learning who funds
the Sons of the Harpy.

296
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,701
- Some things you can't rush.
- You found out?

297
00:27:53,803 --> 00:27:55,937
The Good Masters of Astapor

298
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,206
and the Wise Masters of Yunkai.

299
00:27:58,307 --> 00:28:01,308
With help from their
friends in Volantis.

300
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,844
You see?

301
00:28:02,946 --> 00:28:05,446
You don't even have to worry
about the local rebellion.

302
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:07,081
We only have to worry about

303
00:28:07,183 --> 00:28:09,383
the three rich foreign
cities paying for it.

304
00:28:09,485 --> 00:28:11,119
We conquered Astapor and Yunkai once.

305
00:28:11,221 --> 00:28:13,054
We will do it again and
execute the Masters.

306
00:28:13,156 --> 00:28:16,557
If the Unsullied march off to
reconquer Astapor and Yunkai,

307
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:18,159
who will remain to defend
the free people of Meereen?

308
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:20,795
If we do not fight them,
how can we stop them?

309
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:22,596
We cannot.

310
00:28:22,698 --> 00:28:25,466
The Masters speak only one language.

311
00:28:25,568 --> 00:28:27,235
They spoke it to me for many years.

312
00:28:27,336 --> 00:28:29,103
I know it better than my mother tongue.

313
00:28:29,205 --> 00:28:32,874
If we want them to hear us, we
must speak it back to them.

314
00:28:32,976 --> 00:28:35,143
May it be the last thing they ever hear.

315
00:28:35,245 --> 00:28:37,311
You may be right.

316
00:28:37,413 --> 00:28:39,380
So we will fight them?

317
00:28:39,482 --> 00:28:41,415
- Possibly.
- Possibly?

318
00:28:41,517 --> 00:28:44,418
It's a conversation.

319
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,821
Tell me, can your little
birds get a message

320
00:28:46,923 --> 00:28:50,158
to the Good Masters of Astapor,
the Wise Masters of Yunkai,

321
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,827
and benevolent enslavers of Volantis?

322
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:55,562
Of course. Men can be fickle,

323
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:58,800
but birds I always trust.

324
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:05,107
exclusive from -tusubt-itulo=-.co/m

325
00:29:05,108 --> 00:29:08,009
Your eye looks much better, Arthur.

326
00:29:08,111 --> 00:29:09,443
How's your mother's jaw?

327
00:29:09,545 --> 00:29:11,078
Better.

328
00:29:11,181 --> 00:29:12,513
And your father?

329
00:29:12,615 --> 00:29:15,082
No one's seen him.

330
00:29:15,185 --> 00:29:16,450
And no one will.

331
00:29:16,552 --> 00:29:18,186
That worked out rather nicely.

332
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:20,321
Will Lord Varys ever come back?

333
00:29:20,423 --> 00:29:22,489
I don't think so.

334
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:24,391
Do you miss him?

335
00:29:24,493 --> 00:29:27,061
He was nice.

336
00:29:27,163 --> 00:29:29,463
He called us his little birds.

337
00:29:29,565 --> 00:29:31,165
He gave us sweets.

338
00:29:33,402 --> 00:29:36,103
It's funny you should mention that.

339
00:29:37,874 --> 00:29:41,809
Guess what I happened to find today.

340
00:29:41,911 --> 00:29:45,512
Candied plums from Dorne.

341
00:29:49,052 --> 00:29:51,185
Now remember, if any of your friends

342
00:29:51,287 --> 00:29:54,521
like sweets or need help,
they can always come to me.

343
00:29:54,623 --> 00:29:59,026
All I need in return are whispers.

344
00:30:06,469 --> 00:30:08,269
No need to be afraid.

345
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:10,271
This is Ser Gregor.

346
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:12,606
He's friends with all my friends.

347
00:30:18,447 --> 00:30:20,147
Run along now.

348
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:26,820
Varys's little birds?

349
00:30:26,923 --> 00:30:28,422
Your little birds now, Your Grace.

350
00:30:28,524 --> 00:30:30,457
What did you do to him exactly?

351
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,226
I haven't been able to
get a clear answer.

352
00:30:32,328 --> 00:30:34,362
Oh, a number of things.

353
00:30:34,463 --> 00:30:35,963
Does he understand what we're saying?

354
00:30:36,065 --> 00:30:38,299
I mean, to the extent
that he ever understood

355
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:40,634
complete sentences in the first place.

356
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:44,505
He understands well enough.

357
00:30:44,607 --> 00:30:46,640
So tell him to march into the sept

358
00:30:46,742 --> 00:30:49,343
and crush the High Sparrow's
head like a melon.

359
00:30:49,445 --> 00:30:52,846
The High Sparrow has hundreds of
Faith Militant surrounding him.

360
00:30:52,949 --> 00:30:55,216
Ser Gregor can't face them all.

361
00:30:55,318 --> 00:30:57,251
And he won't have to.

362
00:30:57,353 --> 00:30:59,353
He'll only have to face one.

363
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,891
Has the Faith leveled
official charges yet?

364
00:31:03,993 --> 00:31:05,659
Not yet.

365
00:31:05,761 --> 00:31:08,930
That is one trial by combat
I look forward to watching.

366
00:31:09,032 --> 00:31:10,932
Don't stop at the city.

367
00:31:11,034 --> 00:31:13,334
I want little birds in Dorne,

368
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:16,103
in Highgarden, in the North.

369
00:31:16,205 --> 00:31:19,273
If someone is planning on
making our losses their gains,

370
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:21,208
I want to hear it.

371
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:23,911
If someone is laughing at the queen

372
00:31:24,013 --> 00:31:26,647
who walked naked through the
streets covered in shit,

373
00:31:26,749 --> 00:31:28,515
I want to hear.

374
00:31:28,617 --> 00:31:31,385
I want to know who they are.

375
00:31:31,487 --> 00:31:33,620
I want to know where they are.

376
00:31:39,862 --> 00:31:42,830
- As bad as Lord Varys was,
- Qyburn is worse.

377
00:31:42,932 --> 00:31:45,333
I told them all. I told them.

378
00:31:45,435 --> 00:31:47,335
He's arrogant, dangerous.

379
00:31:47,437 --> 00:31:50,471
You don't get thrown out of the
Citadel without good reason.

380
00:31:50,573 --> 00:31:52,306
And no one listened to my advice.

381
00:31:52,408 --> 00:31:54,508
So here we are.

382
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:59,047
And what he's done to Gregor
Clegane is an abomination.

383
00:31:59,048 --> 00:32:02,149
We never sanctioned this experiment.

384
00:32:02,251 --> 00:32:04,818
I for one think it will
be in our best interest

385
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,587
to have the beast dest...

386
00:32:11,461 --> 00:32:13,995
- Can I help you?
- Why are you here?

387
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:16,464
- My mother...
- I was invited, my dear,

388
00:32:16,565 --> 00:32:19,233
to help deal with several
troublesome issues,

389
00:32:19,335 --> 00:32:21,635
such as the queen's imprisonment.

390
00:32:21,737 --> 00:32:24,171
Thank you for bringing it up.

391
00:32:24,273 --> 00:32:27,975
It's well past time we addressed
the abuses I endured.

392
00:32:28,077 --> 00:32:30,277
Margaery is the queen.

393
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,146
You are not the queen

394
00:32:32,248 --> 00:32:34,281
because you're not married to the king.

395
00:32:34,384 --> 00:32:36,083
I do appreciate these things

396
00:32:36,185 --> 00:32:39,786
can get a bit confusing in your family.

397
00:32:39,889 --> 00:32:42,056
This is a small council meeting.

398
00:32:42,158 --> 00:32:44,291
You have no position
on the small council.

399
00:32:44,394 --> 00:32:46,160
I'm the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

400
00:32:46,262 --> 00:32:47,694
The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard

401
00:32:47,796 --> 00:32:49,530
does have a position
on the small council.

402
00:32:49,632 --> 00:32:52,166
Grand Maester Pycelle, would
you sanction that statement?

403
00:32:52,268 --> 00:32:54,368
Well...

404
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:57,438
I would say Ser Gerold Hightower

405
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,606
had a seat on the Mad King's council.

406
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:02,276
Of course, that was the Mad King.

407
00:33:02,378 --> 00:33:03,977
King Robert saw things differently.

408
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,779
And King...

409
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:11,919
What about Myrcella's death, Uncle?

410
00:33:12,021 --> 00:33:14,188
Do you consider the
murder of your own blood

411
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,290
a troublesome issue?

412
00:33:16,392 --> 00:33:18,225
The same women who murdered Myrcella

413
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:20,794
have overthrown House Martell
and taken control of Dorne.

414
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,596
We've got a lot to discuss.

415
00:33:22,698 --> 00:33:25,099
All of us together.

416
00:33:25,201 --> 00:33:28,902
And seeing as you cannot make us
leave, we best get on with it.

417
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,574
No, we cannot make you leave.

418
00:33:33,676 --> 00:33:36,777
And you cannot make us stay.

419
00:33:36,879 --> 00:33:40,481
Not unless you're gonna have
that thing murder us all.

420
00:33:51,588 --> 00:34:21,855
VISIT US : TU-SUBT-TITULO-.C.O/M.

421
00:34:21,857 --> 00:34:23,690
Your Grace.

422
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:26,960
My mother would like to see her
daughter's final resting place.

423
00:34:27,062 --> 00:34:29,630
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

424
00:34:29,732 --> 00:34:31,599
That's not possible. Not yet.

425
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,367
When will it be possible?

426
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:35,769
When she's fully atoned for her sins.

427
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:38,439
You cut off her hair
and marched her naked

428
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:40,974
through the streets in
front of the whole city.

429
00:34:41,076 --> 00:34:42,743
That wasn't the full atonement?!

430
00:34:42,845 --> 00:34:44,612
No.

431
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,848
She must stand trial
before seven septons

432
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,083
so we can learn the true
extent of her sins.

433
00:34:50,186 --> 00:34:54,355
I want you to let her see
Myrcella's resting place.

434
00:34:54,457 --> 00:34:56,023
I am the king.

435
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:57,591
You are.

436
00:34:59,629 --> 00:35:01,495
And what does that mean to you?

437
00:35:01,597 --> 00:35:02,963
It means a great deal to me.

438
00:35:03,065 --> 00:35:04,965
The Crown and the Faith

439
00:35:05,067 --> 00:35:07,201
are the twin pillars of the world.

440
00:35:07,303 --> 00:35:09,336
Do you know who told me that?

441
00:35:10,706 --> 00:35:12,039
Your mother.

442
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:14,642
My mother who is unclean?

443
00:35:14,743 --> 00:35:18,712
My mother who still needs to atone
after all you've put her through?

444
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:40,734
How do you think the Mother
Above first came to us?

445
00:35:41,737 --> 00:35:43,537
How did men and women

446
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:47,107
first come to feel the
Mother's presence?

447
00:35:48,544 --> 00:35:50,311
It was through their own mothers.

448
00:35:53,048 --> 00:35:56,417
There's a great deal of falsehood
in Cersei. You know that.

449
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:00,721
But when she speaks of you, the
Mother's love outshines it all.

450
00:36:02,758 --> 00:36:05,693
Her love for you is more real

451
00:36:05,794 --> 00:36:07,695
than anything else in this world

452
00:36:07,796 --> 00:36:10,797
because it doesn't come from this world.

453
00:36:10,899 --> 00:36:12,833
But you know that.

454
00:36:12,935 --> 00:36:15,536
You've felt it.

455
00:36:15,638 --> 00:36:17,838
You've seen her when she talks to you.

456
00:36:19,942 --> 00:36:21,709
Yes.

457
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,010
It's a great gift.

458
00:36:24,113 --> 00:36:26,113
One I never had.

459
00:36:27,717 --> 00:36:29,750
Envy.

460
00:36:29,852 --> 00:36:32,286
One more thing for me to atone for.

461
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:35,623
Your Grace, do you... may I?

462
00:36:35,725 --> 00:36:37,291
Do you mind?

463
00:36:37,393 --> 00:36:38,726
It's my knees.

464
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:40,694
Of course.

465
00:36:46,034 --> 00:36:49,936
When your mother made
her walk of atonement,

466
00:36:50,038 --> 00:36:52,239
she did it to get back to you.

467
00:36:52,341 --> 00:36:55,108
I still don't understand
why you want to put her

468
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,977
through any more than
she's already endured.

469
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:00,447
It's not what I want.
It's what the gods want.

470
00:37:00,549 --> 00:37:03,150
They make their will known
to us and it's up to us

471
00:37:03,252 --> 00:37:05,686
to either accept or reject it.

472
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,456
Please.

473
00:37:14,764 --> 00:37:17,998
If we're to be just and good,

474
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,834
then we accept it, all
of us, even kings.

475
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:25,205
A true leader avails himself
of the wisest counsel he can.

476
00:37:25,308 --> 00:37:27,741
And no one is wiser than the gods.

477
00:37:30,313 --> 00:37:33,480
My grandfather once
said something similar.

478
00:37:33,582 --> 00:37:35,416
Except for the part about the gods.

479
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:39,420
The gods worked through him
whether he knew it or not.

480
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,723
As they work through your mother.

481
00:37:44,993 --> 00:37:47,027
There's so much good in all of us.

482
00:37:47,129 --> 00:37:50,831
The best we can do is to help
each other bring it out.

483
00:38:19,061 --> 00:38:20,828
Who are you?

484
00:38:20,929 --> 00:38:22,329
No one.

485
00:38:24,233 --> 00:38:26,734
Who were you before you came here?

486
00:38:26,836 --> 00:38:28,469
Arya Stark.

487
00:38:30,473 --> 00:38:33,039
Tell me about Arya Stark's family.

488
00:38:33,141 --> 00:38:36,009
Her father was Eddard Stark.

489
00:38:36,111 --> 00:38:38,645
Her mother was Catelyn Stark.

490
00:38:38,748 --> 00:38:42,082
She had one sister, Sansa,

491
00:38:42,184 --> 00:38:44,084
and four brothers.

492
00:38:53,796 --> 00:38:55,562
Three brothers.

493
00:38:55,664 --> 00:38:58,465
Robb, Bran, Rickon.

494
00:39:00,436 --> 00:39:03,336
And a half-brother Jon.

495
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:06,840
And where are they now?

496
00:39:06,942 --> 00:39:09,910
They may be dead for all a girl knows.

497
00:39:20,188 --> 00:39:21,622
Tell me about the Hound.

498
00:39:23,526 --> 00:39:25,258
Also dead.

499
00:39:35,438 --> 00:39:38,639
Arya Stark left him to die.
He was on her list.

500
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:44,210
He was not on her list anymore.

501
00:39:44,313 --> 00:39:46,046
She had taken him off it.

502
00:39:46,148 --> 00:39:50,216
Why? Didn't she want
him dead any longer?

503
00:39:54,056 --> 00:39:56,323
She did and she did not.

504
00:39:59,829 --> 00:40:02,963
She sounds confused.

505
00:40:07,603 --> 00:40:11,472
Yes, she was.

506
00:40:15,678 --> 00:40:18,411
Who else was on Arya
Stark's funny little list?

507
00:40:19,427 --> 00:40:21,515
Cersei Lannister.

508
00:40:23,085 --> 00:40:24,250
Gregor Clegane.

509
00:40:26,188 --> 00:40:27,588
Walder Frey.

510
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,094
That's a short list.

511
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:40,601
That can't be everyone you want to kill.

512
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:45,906
Are you sure you're not
forgetting someone?

513
00:40:48,911 --> 00:40:52,012
Which name would you
like a girl to speak?

514
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:30,083
If a girl tells me her name,

515
00:41:30,185 --> 00:41:32,586
I will give her eyes back.

516
00:41:35,524 --> 00:41:37,490
A girl has no name.

517
00:41:41,196 --> 00:41:42,228
Come.

518
00:42:15,764 --> 00:42:17,898
If a girl is truly no one,

519
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,433
she has nothing to fear.

520
00:42:45,761 --> 00:42:47,894
Who are you?

521
00:42:51,299 --> 00:42:53,166
No one.

522
00:43:02,745 --> 00:43:05,879
The Umbers are a famously loyal house.

523
00:43:05,981 --> 00:43:08,448
Famously loyal to the Starks.

524
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:11,584
And you, Lord Karstark.

525
00:43:11,687 --> 00:43:14,487
Your people share blood with
the Starks, don't they?

526
00:43:14,589 --> 00:43:17,223
But here we are. Times change.

527
00:43:17,325 --> 00:43:19,626
When my father became
Warden of the North,

528
00:43:19,728 --> 00:43:21,728
your house refused to
pledge their banners.

529
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,596
Your father was a cunt.

530
00:43:26,802 --> 00:43:29,036
My beloved father, the Warden...

531
00:43:29,138 --> 00:43:32,272
Your father was a cunt and
that's why you killed him.

532
00:43:32,374 --> 00:43:35,208
I might have done the same to my father

533
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,878
if he hadn't have done me the
favor of dying on his own.

534
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,781
My father was poisoned by our enemies.

535
00:43:42,718 --> 00:43:46,019
Why have you come to
Winterfell, Lord Umber?

536
00:43:46,121 --> 00:43:49,956
The bastard Jon Snow led an army
of wildlings past the Wall.

537
00:43:50,059 --> 00:43:52,458
We're farther north than
any of you fuckers.

538
00:43:52,561 --> 00:43:55,829
Wildlings come down, we always
have to fight them first.

539
00:43:55,931 --> 00:43:59,166
I like fighting wildlings.
Been doing it all my life.

540
00:43:59,267 --> 00:44:02,002
But there are too many of them
for us to beat back alone.

541
00:44:02,104 --> 00:44:04,971
So now you've come seeking help?

542
00:44:05,074 --> 00:44:07,407
We need to help each other.

543
00:44:07,509 --> 00:44:11,078
The colder it gets, the farther
south those goat fuckers will roam.

544
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,146
Won't take them long to get here.

545
00:44:13,248 --> 00:44:16,083
You think a horde of wildlings
can take Winterfell?

546
00:44:16,185 --> 00:44:17,751
If they get Jon Snow
leading them, maybe.

547
00:44:17,853 --> 00:44:20,320
He knows this place
better than we ever will.

548
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:25,592
Pledge your banners to House Bolton.

549
00:44:25,694 --> 00:44:28,228
Swear loyalty to me as
Warden of the North

550
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:30,831
and we will fight together
to destroy the bastard

551
00:44:30,933 --> 00:44:32,432
and all his wildling friends.

552
00:44:32,534 --> 00:44:34,735
I'm not kissing your fucking hand.

553
00:44:34,837 --> 00:44:37,437
Traditionally a bannerman
kneels before his lord.

554
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:39,572
I'm not doing that either.

555
00:44:39,674 --> 00:44:42,609
Why would I trust a man who
won't honor tradition?

556
00:44:42,711 --> 00:44:45,545
Your father honored tradition.

557
00:44:45,647 --> 00:44:47,848
Knelt for Robb Stark.

558
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:50,350
Called him King of the North.

559
00:44:50,452 --> 00:44:52,619
Was Robb Stark right
to trust your father?

560
00:44:52,721 --> 00:44:54,520
Then it appears we're
at a bit of an impasse.

561
00:44:54,623 --> 00:44:57,758
Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths.

562
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,459
I've got a gift for you.

563
00:45:02,397 --> 00:45:05,165
A girl, I hope. I prefer redheads.

564
00:45:05,267 --> 00:45:08,235
A girl, aye.

565
00:45:09,604 --> 00:45:11,638
A wild one.

566
00:45:19,314 --> 00:45:21,148
I like them wild.

567
00:45:22,217 --> 00:45:25,718
And the boy, nice and young.

568
00:45:25,821 --> 00:45:27,988
The way Karstark likes them.

569
00:45:33,796 --> 00:45:35,262
Who's this?

570
00:45:35,363 --> 00:45:37,730
Rickon Stark.

571
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,140
How do I know that's Rickon Stark?

572
00:46:17,806 --> 00:46:20,673
Welcome home, Lord Stark.

573
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,887
It's time.

574
00:47:11,293 --> 00:47:14,394
If you have any last
words, now is the time.

575
00:47:14,496 --> 00:47:16,763
You shouldn't be alive.

576
00:47:16,865 --> 00:47:18,798
It's not right.

577
00:47:19,968 --> 00:47:21,768
Neither was killing me.

578
00:47:26,108 --> 00:47:28,741
My mother's still
living at White Harbor.

579
00:47:28,843 --> 00:47:30,743
Could you write her?

580
00:47:30,845 --> 00:47:33,146
Tell her I died fighting the wildlings.

581
00:47:41,556 --> 00:47:45,292
I had a choice, Lord Commander.

582
00:47:45,394 --> 00:47:49,362
Betray you or betray the Night's Watch.

583
00:47:49,464 --> 00:47:52,532
You brought an army of
wildlings into our lands.

584
00:47:54,403 --> 00:47:57,270
An army of murderers and raiders.

585
00:47:57,372 --> 00:48:01,074
If I had to do it all over
knowing where I'd end up,

586
00:48:01,176 --> 00:48:04,610
I pray I'd make the right choice again.

587
00:48:04,712 --> 00:48:06,746
I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser.

588
00:48:06,848 --> 00:48:09,849
I fought, I lost.

589
00:48:11,686 --> 00:48:13,619
Now I rest.

590
00:48:14,622 --> 00:48:18,524
But you, Lord Snow,

591
00:48:18,626 --> 00:48:21,027
you'll be fighting
their battles forever.

592
00:50:08,203 --> 00:50:10,136
We should burn the bodies.

593
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:13,139
You should.

594
00:50:21,883 --> 00:50:24,184
What do you want me to do with this?

595
00:50:24,286 --> 00:50:25,985
Wear it.

596
00:50:26,088 --> 00:50:28,388
Burn it.

597
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:30,690
Whatever you want.

598
00:50:30,792 --> 00:50:32,292
You have Castle Black.

599
00:50:39,101 --> 00:50:41,301
My watch is ended.
