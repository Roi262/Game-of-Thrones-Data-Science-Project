1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,030
The Lannisters have declared war 
on House Tyrell.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,280
They have declared war on Dorne.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,780
We must be allies now,
if we wish to survive.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,870
I offer vengeance...
justice...

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,700
Fire and blood.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,570
I traveled south

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,320
under orders
from the Lord Commander.

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,660
You ought to be a Maester.

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,070
Spending your life reading
about the achievements

10
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,200
of better men.

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,070
It's a map of Dragonstone.

12
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,200
That's dragonglass.

13
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,830
A mountain of it,
beneath the ground.

14
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,200
John needs to know.

15
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,830
You must send me away.

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,120
I command you to heal yourself.

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,410
I command you to find the cure.

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,410
So why's a nice girl on her own
heading to King's Landing?

19
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,240
I'm going to kill the queen.

20
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,530
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

21
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,200
the new king
of the Iron Islands.

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,070
The Iron Fleet is the greatest
armada Westeros has ever seen.

23
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,280
The surest way to
a woman's heart is with a gift.

24
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,370
I won't return to King's Landing
until I have that for you.

25
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,240
Shall we begin?

26
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,030
Tyrion:
On a night like this,
you came into the world.

27
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,320
Varys:
I remember that storm.

28
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,070
All the dogs in King's Landing

29
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,070
howled through the night.

30
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,700
I wish I could remember it.

31
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,620
I always thought
this would be a homecoming.

32
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,410
Doesn't feel like home.

33
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,740
We won't stay
on Dragonstone for long.

34
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,030
Good.

35
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,280
Daenerys:
Not so many lions.

36
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,200
Varys:
Cersei controls fewer
than half the Seven Kingdoms.

37
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,490
The lords of Westeros
despise her.

38
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,370
Even before your arrival,
they plotted against her.

39
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,870
- Now...
- They cry out
for their true queen?

40
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,490
They drink secret toasts
to my health?

41
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,450
People used to
tell my brother
that sort of thing,

42
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,490
and he was stupid enough
to believe them.

43
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,320
If Viserys had three dragons
and an army at his back,

44
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,320
he'd have invaded
King's Landing already.

45
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,910
Conquering Westeros
would be easy for you.

46
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,320
But you're not here
to be queen of the ashes.

47
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,070
No.

48
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,320
We can take the Seven Kingdoms

49
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,200
without turning it
into a slaughterhouse.

50
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,780
If the great houses support
your claim against Cersei,

51
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,870
the game is won.

52
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,320
With the Tyrell army
and the Dornish
on our side,

53
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,490
we have powerful allies
in the south.

54
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,070
I never properly
thanked you for that.

55
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,820
They joined our side, my queen,

56
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,370
because they believe in you.

57
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,700
You served my father,
didn't you, Lord Varys?

58
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,320
I did.

59
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,660
And then you served
the man who overthrew him.

60
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,410
I had a choice,
Your Grace...

61
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,530
Serve Robert Baratheon
or face the headman's axe.

62
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,870
But you didn't serve him long.

63
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,320
You turned against him.

64
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,490
Robert was an improvement
on your father, to be sure.

65
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,570
There have been
few rulers in history

66
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,660
as cruel as the Mad King.

67
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,120
Robert was
neither mad nor cruel.

68
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,660
He simply had no interest
in being king.

69
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,370
So you took it upon yourself
to find a better one.

70
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,570
Your Grace,

71
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,570
when I was
ready to drink myself
into a small coffin,

72
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,620
Lord Varys told me about
a queen in the east who...

73
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,530
Before I came to power,
you favored my brother.

74
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,240
All your spies,
your little birds,

75
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,910
did they tell you Viserys
was cruel, stupid, and weak?

76
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,530
Would those qualities
have made for a good king
in your learned opinion?

77
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,200
Until your marriage
to Khal Drogo, Your Grace,

78
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,700
I knew nothing about you,
save your existence

79
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,030
and that you were said
to be beautiful.

80
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,740
So you and your friends
traded me like a prized horse
to the Dothraki.

81
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,740
Which you turned
to your advantage.

82
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,780
Who gave the order to kill me?

83
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,820
King Robert.

84
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,570
Who hired the assassins?

85
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,740
Who sent word to Essos
to murder Daenerys Targaryen?

86
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,280
- Your Grace, I did
what had to be done to...
- To keep yourself alive.

87
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,570
Lord Varys
has proven himself
a loyal servant.

88
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,370
Proven himself loyal?
Quite the opposite.

89
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,070
If he dislikes one monarch,
he conspires to crown
the next one.

90
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,490
What kind of a servant is that?

91
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,620
The kind the realm needs.

92
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,990
Incompetence should not
be rewarded with
blind loyalty.

93
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,950
As long
as I have my eyes,
I'll use them.

94
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,660
I wasn't born
into a great house.

95
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,240
I came from nothing.

96
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,200
I was sold as a slave
and carved up as an offering.

97
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,030
When I was a child,
I lived in alleys, gutters,
abandoned houses.

98
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,620
You wish to know
where my true loyalties lie?

99
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,820
Not with any king or queen,
but with the people.

100
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,780
The people
who suffer under despots
and prosper under just rule.

101
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,160
The people whose hearts
you aim to win.

102
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,870
If you demand blind allegiance,

103
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,620
I respect your wishes.

104
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,620
Grey Worm can behead me
or your dragons
can devour me.

105
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,200
But if you let me live,
I will serve you well.

106
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,490
I will dedicate myself
to seeing you on
the Iron Throne

107
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,990
because I choose you.

108
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,530
Because I know the people
have no better chance
than you.

109
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,990
Swear this to me, Varys.

110
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,950
If you ever think
I'm failing the people,

111
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,160
you won't conspire
behind my back.

112
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,120
You'll look me in the eye
as you have done today,

113
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,950
and you'll tell me
how I'm failing them.

114
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,950
I swear it, my queen.

115
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,200
And I swear this...
If you ever betray me,

116
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,910
I'll burn you alive.

117
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,660
I would expect nothing less
from the Mother of Dragons.

118
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,700
Forgive me, my queen.

119
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,870
A red priestess from As'shai
has come to see you.

120
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,950
She once served another
who wanted the Iron Throne.

121
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,870
It didn't end well
for Stannis Baratheon,
did it?

122
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,530
No, it didn't.

123
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,370
You chose an auspicious day
to arrive at Dragonstone.

124
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,240
We've just decided
to pardon those

125
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,910
who once served the wrong king.

126
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,240
The Lord of Light
doesn't have many followers
in Westeros, does he?

127
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,910
Not yet, but even those
who don't worship the Lord

128
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,410
can serve his cause.

129
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,320
What does your lord
expect from me?

130
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,660
"The prince who was promised
will bring the dawn."

131
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,950
I'm afraid I'm not a prince.

132
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,530
Missandei:
Your Grace,
forgive me,

133
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,490
but your translation
is not quite accurate.

134
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,240
That noun has no gender
in High Valyrian,

135
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,200
so the proper translation
for that prophecy would be,

136
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,570
"The prince or princess
who was promised will
bring the dawn."

137
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,740
Doesn't really roll
off the tongue, does it?

138
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,280
No, but I like it better.

139
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,820
And you believe
this prophecy
refers to me?

140
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,620
Prophecies are dangerous things.

141
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,950
I believe you have
a role to play.

142
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,820
As does another...

143
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,320
The King in the North, Jon Snow.

144
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,030
Jon Snow?

145
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,820
- Ned Stark's bastard?
- You know him?

146
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,990
I travelled with him
to the Wall when he joined
the Night's Watch.

147
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,120
And why do you
think the Lord of Light
singled out this Jon Snow?

148
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,820
Aside from the visions
you've seen in the flames,
that is.

149
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,740
As Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch,

150
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,990
he allowed the wildlings
south of the Wall

151
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,070
to protect them
from grave danger.

152
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,660
As King in the North,

153
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,490
he has united those wildlings
with the Northern houses,

154
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,990
so together they may
face their common enemy.

155
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,120
He sounds like quite a man.

156
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,490
Summon Jon Snow.

157
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,160
Let him stand before you

158
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,780
and tell you the things
that have happened to him,

159
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,410
the things
that he has seen
with his own eyes.

160
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,570
I can't speak to prophecies

161
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,200
or visions in the flames,

162
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,990
but I like Jon Snow
and I trusted him.

163
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,490
And I am an excellent
judge of character.

164
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,950
If he does rule the North,

165
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,700
he would make a valuable ally.

166
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,950
The Lannisters
executed his father

167
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,120
and conspired
to murder his brother.

168
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,320
Jon Snow has even more reason
to hate Cersei than you do.

169
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,490
Very well.

170
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,280
Send a raven north.

171
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,280
Tell Jon Snow that his queen

172
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,280
invites him to come
to Dragonstone...

173
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,030
and bend the knee.

174
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,570
Gather round.
Come here.

175
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,070
Sansa:
You think
it's really Tyrion?

176
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,570
It could be someone
trying to lure you
into a trap.

177
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,120
Read the last bit.

178
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,740
"All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes."

179
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,490
What does that mean?

180
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,410
It's something he said to me
the first night we met.

181
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,580
You know him better
than any of us.

182
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,740
What do you think?

183
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,820
Tyrion's not like
the other Lannisters.

184
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:28,620
He was always kind to me,
but it's too great a risk.

185
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,620
"The Seven Kingdoms will bleed

186
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,120
as long as Cersei sits
on the Iron Throne.

187
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,280
Join us.

188
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,120
Together, we can
end her tyranny."

189
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
Sounds like a charmer.

190
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,490
Of course,
the casual mention
of a Dothraki horde,

191
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,450
a legion of Unsullied,
and three dragons...

192
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,990
A bit less charming.

193
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,160
What?

194
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,410
Fire kills wights, you told me.

195
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,580
What breathes fire?

196
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,780
You're not suggesting
Jon meet with her?

197
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,200
- No, too dangerous.
- But?

198
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,160
But if the Army of the Dead
makes it past the Wall,

199
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,660
do we have enough men
to fight them?

200
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,370
If the Mad King's daughter
takes the Iron Throne,

201
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,280
she'll destroy the realm
as we know it.

202
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,530
Some of you are bannermen
of House Tyrell.

203
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,660
But House Tyrell
is in open rebellion
against the crown.

204
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,870
With their help,
the Mad King's daughter

205
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,370
has ferried
an army of savages
to our shores...

206
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:35,160
Mindless Unsullied soldiers
who will destroy your castles
and your holdfasts,

207
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,320
Dothraki heathens
who will burn your
villages to the ground,

208
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,530
rape and enslave your women,

209
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,450
and butcher your children
without a second thought.

210
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:49,320
This is how Olenna Tyrell
rewards centuries of service
and loyalty.

211
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,160
Cersei: You all remember
the Mad King.

212
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,700
You remember the horrors
he inflicted upon his people.

213
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,700
His daughter is no different.

214
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,490
In Essos, her brutality
is already legendary.

215
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,780
She crucified
hundreds of noblemen
in Slaver's Bay.

216
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,450
And when she grew bored of that,

217
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,700
she fed them to her dragons.

218
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,280
It is my solemn duty
to protect the people,
and I will.

219
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,450
But I need your help, my lords.

220
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,240
We must stand together,
all of us...

221
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,450
if we hope to stop her.

222
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,870
She has three
full-grown dragons,
Your Grace.

223
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,030
The same as Aegon
when he conquered

224
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,530
the Seven Kingdoms.

225
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,910
How do you propose to stop them?

226
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,700
We are currently at work
on a solution, my lord.

227
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,580
Lord Tarly.

228
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,320
Ser Jaime.

229
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,030
I believe you know my son.

230
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,030
Ser Jaime.

231
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,530
Rickard, isn't it?

232
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,240
Dickon.

233
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,780
That's it.

234
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,780
Thank you for coming.

235
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,700
The other lords of the Reach
look to you for guidance,
now more than ever.

236
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,410
They might not have come
if you hadn't.

237
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,700
If my queen summons me,
I answer the call.

238
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,490
And I've heard
what she does to
those who defy her.

239
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,740
You ride for Horn Hill today?

240
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,450
I have an army to mobilize.

241
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,780
Won't be long before
the fighting starts.

242
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,240
And which side
will you be fighting for?

243
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,570
You were the only man to defeat
Robert Baratheon in battle.

244
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,490
Not even Rhaegar Targaryen
could do that.

245
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,450
It's a long ride back
to the Reach, Ser Jaime.
How may I serve?

246
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,410
I want you to be
my ranking general
in the wars to come.

247
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,530
I want you to swear
allegiance to Cersei

248
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,530
and I want you to help me
destroy her enemies.

249
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,370
All her enemies.

250
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,410
Including Olenna Tyrell.

251
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,660
I'm a Tarly.

252
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,160
That name means something.

253
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,200
We're not oathbreakers.
We're not schemers.

254
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,660
We don't stab
our rivals in the back

255
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,490
or cut their throats
at weddings.

256
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,530
I swore an oath to House Tyrell.

257
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,870
You swore an oath
to the crown as well,
Lord Tarly.

258
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,660
I've known Olenna
since I was a child.

259
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,280
She was a great woman once.

260
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,660
Now she's broken.

261
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,780
She wants revenge so badly,

262
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,030
she brought the Dothraki
to our shores.

263
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:34,950
The Dothraki in Westeros
for the first time
in history.

264
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,870
I know you don't like my sister,

265
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,030
but you have to make a choice.

266
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,070
Do you fight with us

267
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,200
or with foreign savages
and eunuchs?

268
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,700
When the war is won,

269
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,870
the queen will need
a new Warden of the South.

270
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,700
I can think of no better man

271
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,530
than Randyll Tarly.

272
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,370
Ebrose:
The infection
has spread too far.

273
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,320
You should have
cut off your arm
the moment you were touched.

274
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,160
How long?

275
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,030
It'll be years
before it kills you.

276
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,620
Could be 10.

277
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,280
Could be 20.

278
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,030
But how long until...?

279
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,530
Your mind?

280
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,410
Six months, maybe fewer.

281
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,200
Um...

282
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,910
Pardon, Archmaester.

283
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,910
I met Stannis Baratheon's
daughter at Castle Black.

284
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,370
She had the greyscale
as a baby and was cured.

285
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,950
- Ebrose: No.
- Isn't there some way...

286
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,740
Ebrose:
Does this look like
a baby to you?

287
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,070
- No.
- Have you studied

288
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,120
the varying rates
of greyscale progression

289
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,740
in infants and fully grown men?

290
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,160
No.

291
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,530
Ebrose:
Maester Cressen discovered.

292
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,120
Shireen Baratheon's
affliction immediately.

293
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,280
This is quite advanced.

294
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,320
And beyond our skills, ser.

295
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,740
Were you a commoner,
I'd have you shipped
to Valyria at once

296
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,280
to live out your life
with the stone men.

297
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,120
As an anointed knight,
I'll allow you one more day.

298
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,450
How you choose
to spend that time
is up to you.

299
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,950
Come, Samwell.

300
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,700
Should we send word
to your family, Ser...?

301
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
Jorah.

302
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,660
Jorah Mormont.

303
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,700
Mormont?

304
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,450
There's no need.

305
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,030
I've been dead
to them for years.

306
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,370
Ebrose:
Come, Samwell!

307
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,240
Qyburn:
Have you ever been
down here, Your Grace?

308
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,740
No, I can't say I have.

309
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:31,450
I haven't seen these
since Robert had them
removed from the throne room.

310
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,410
Curious that King Robert
did not have them destroyed.

311
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,570
They were his trophies.

312
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,780
He couldn't keep them around.

313
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,700
They would have
made him look small.

314
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,240
Sometimes
he would come down here
and look at them.

315
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,410
I believe he brought
his whores on occasion.

316
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,530
Balerion the Dread.

317
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,950
The beast that Aegon
rode across the sea.

318
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,870
His flames forged
the Iron Throne

319
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,740
and brought
the Seven Kingdoms
to heel.

320
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,070
Powerful...

321
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,620
but not invincible.

322
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:21,410
Apparently,
one of Daenerys's dragons

323
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,070
was wounded by spears
in the fighting pits
of Meereen.

324
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,910
And if they can be wounded,

325
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,280
they can be killed.

326
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,570
The finest artillators
and blacksmiths in
King's Landing

327
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,410
have been laboring
day and night,
Your Grace.

328
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,450
If you'll kindly
pull that lever.

329
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,450
Yara:
If you want
the Iron Throne, take it.

330
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,620
We have an army, a fleet,
and three dragons.

331
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,280
We should hit
King's Landing now, hard,
with everything we have.

332
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,780
The city will fall within a day.

333
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,700
If we turn the dragons loose,
tens of thousands will die
in the firestorms.

334
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,280
It's called war.

335
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,280
You don't have
the stomach for it,
scurry back into hiding.

336
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,620
I know how you wage war.

337
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,370
We don't poison
little girls here.

338
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,660
Myrcella was innocent.

339
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,030
She was a Lannister.

340
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,660
There are no
innocent Lannisters.

341
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,950
My greatest regret
is that Oberyn died
fighting for you.

342
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,820
Daenerys:
That's enough.

343
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,410
Lord Tyrion
is Hand of the Queen.

344
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,830
You will treat him with respect.

345
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,830
I am not here to be
queen of the ashes.

346
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,240
That's very nice to hear.

347
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,200
Of course,
I can't remember a queen

348
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,160
who was better loved
than my granddaughter.

349
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,120
The common people loved her.

350
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,870
The nobles loved her.

351
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,620
And what is left of her now?

352
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,450
Ashes.

353
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,160
Commoners, nobles,

354
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,030
they're all
just children, really.

355
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:13,660
They won't obey you
unless they fear you.

356
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,910
I'm grateful
to you, Lady Olenna,
for your counsel.

357
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,820
I'm grateful to all of you.

358
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,450
But you have chosen
to follow me.

359
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,820
I will not attack
King's Landing.

360
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,660
We will not attack
King's Landing.

361
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:31,320
Then how do you mean
to take the Iron Throne?

362
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,660
By asking nicely?

363
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,200
We will lay siege
to the capital,

364
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,910
surrounding the city
on all sides.

365
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,700
Cersei will have
the Iron Throne,

366
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,070
but no food for her army
or the people.

367
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,990
But we won't use
Dothraki and Unsullied.

368
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,030
Cersei will try to rally
the lords of Westeros

369
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,700
by appealing to their loyalty,

370
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,370
their love for their country.

371
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,280
If we besiege the city
with foreigners,

372
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,990
we prove her point.

373
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,620
Our army should be Westerosi.

374
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,910
And I suppose
we're providing
the Westerosi?

375
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,200
You are.

376
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,580
Lady Greyjoy
will escort you home
to Sunspear.

377
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,570
And her Iron Fleet
will ferry the Dornish army

378
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,570
back up to King's Landing.

379
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,410
The Dornish
will lay siege
to the capital

380
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,450
alongside the Tyrell army.

381
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,120
Two great kingdoms
united against Cersei.

382
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,240
So, your master plan
is to use our armies.

383
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,620
Forgive me for asking,
but why did you bother
to bring your own?

384
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,120
The Unsullied will have
another objective.

385
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,700
For decades,
House Lannister has been
the true power in Westeros.

386
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,870
And the seat of that power
is Casterly Rock.

387
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,780
Grey Worm and the Unsullied

388
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,660
will sail for the Rock
and take it.

389
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,830
Do I have your support?

390
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,990
You have mine.

391
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,660
Dorne is with you, Your Grace.

392
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,320
Thank you all.

393
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,660
Lady Olenna, may I speak
with you alone?

394
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,030
I realize you're here
out of hatred for Cersei
and not love for me.

395
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:36,950
But I swear to you,
she will pay for
what she's done.

396
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,620
And we will bring peace
back to Westeros.

397
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,660
Peace?

398
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,320
Do you think
that's what we had
under your father?

399
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,450
Or his father?
Or his?

400
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:50,120
Peace never lasts, my dear.

401
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,450
Will you take
a bit of advice
from an old woman?

402
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,450
He's a clever man, your Hand.

403
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:00,280
I've known
a great many clever men.

404
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,200
I've outlived them all.

405
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,120
You know why?

406
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,660
I ignored them.

407
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,160
The lords of Westeros are sheep.

408
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,530
Are you a sheep?

409
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,870
No.

410
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,160
You're a dragon.

411
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,700
Be a dragon.

412
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,030
Grey Worm: Mají.

413
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,160
You leave tomorrow.

414
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,410
Were you going to say goodbye?

415
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,030
I will see you when I return.

416
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,910
But you don't know
when that will be.

417
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:42,780
No one knows.

418
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,740
I wish you good fortune.

419
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,280
Missandei.

420
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,240
It is hard for me
to say goodbye to you.

421
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,450
Why?

422
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,120
You know why.

423
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,200
I don't.

424
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,870
Y-you are my weakness.

425
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,320
That's what I am?

426
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,780
Your weakness?

427
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,490
When Unsullied are young,
the masters learn their fears.

428
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,450
One boy is scared of dogs,

429
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,320
one boy hates high places,

430
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,160
one is frightened of the ocean.

431
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,620
They make the boy
sleep with dogs

432
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,530
or climb a cliff.

433
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,820
They throw him in the water.

434
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,120
If he learns to swim, good.

435
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,070
If he drowns, good.

436
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,280
Either way, strong Unsullied.

437
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,700
But I had no fears.

438
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,490
I was never the biggest,
never the strongest...

439
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,160
but I was bravest, always.

440
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,570
- I believe it.
- Until...

441
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,370
I meet Missandei
from the Isle of Naath.

442
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:08,160
Now I have fear.

443
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,990
I do, too.

444
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,200
No.

445
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,410
I want to see you.

446
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,120
Please.

447
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,120
Might be useful.

448
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,990
Ch'Vyalthan was
a dreadful writer,

449
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,820
but an excellent researcher.

450
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,280
- Archmaester,
I wondered if I...
- And this one.

451
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,160
Maester Faull was
quite the opposite...

452
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,910
A brilliant stylist who
invented half the stories
he tells.

453
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,530
Um, I wanted
to ask you...

454
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,320
If you're going
to write histories, Tarly,

455
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,910
you have to do the research.

456
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,780
If you want people
to read your histories,

457
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,030
you need a bit of style.

458
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,030
I'm not writing
"A Chronicle of the Wars.

459
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,870
Following the Death
of King Robert I"

460
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,160
so it can sit on a shelf unread.

461
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,990
What?
You don't
like the title?

462
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,530
What would you call it, then?

463
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:48,870
Mm, possibly something
a bit more poetic?

464
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:51,620
We're not poets, Tarly.

465
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,780
Um, Archmaester,
if I could just
have a moment.

466
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,530
This is your moment.

467
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,990
Use it wisely.

468
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,990
I may have found a way
to treat Ser Jorah.

469
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,370
There are two recorded cases

470
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,200
of advanced greyscale
being cured.

471
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,030
I found the procedure
in the study of rare diseases

472
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,370
by Archmaester Pylos.

473
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,530
I'm familiar with
Archmaester Pylos

474
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,490
and his study of rare diseases.

475
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,490
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.

476
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,410
And shall I tell you
how he died?

477
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,910
From greyscale.

478
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,570
- Oh.
- The procedure's
far too dangerous,

479
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,740
which is why it's now forbidden.

480
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,570
Hello.

481
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,120
What are you doing?

482
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,660
You're Jorah Mormont,

483
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,620
the only son of Jeor Mormont.

484
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,740
My name is Samwell Tarly,

485
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,530
Sworn Brother
of the Night's Watch,

486
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:26,320
training to serve
as maester at Castle Black.

487
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,620
I knew your father.

488
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,120
I was with him when he died.

489
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,320
You are not
dying today,
Ser Jorah.

490
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,950
Drink this.

491
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,740
- What is it?
- Rum.

492
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,660
Drink it all, please.
I'm afraid this is
going to hurt.

493
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,990
If you could
take off your shirt.

494
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,870
If you wouldn't mind,
bite down hard.

495
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:32,320
I'm sorry, but no one
knows I'm here,

496
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,370
and if they
hear you screaming,
then we're both finished.

497
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:40,030
Jorah:
Have you ever
done this before?

498
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:48,370
No.

499
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,740
But no one else will try it,
so I'm the best you've got.

500
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,700
Have a seat.

501
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,620
I'm going to have to remove
the entire upper layer
of infected tissue,

502
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,910
then apply a medicinal
ointment to the...

503
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,740
Shh, shh!

504
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,990
Shh.

505
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:27,410
Again, I'm sorry,

506
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,910
but please try not to scream.

507
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,240
They say her dragons
are bigger than Aegon's.

508
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,990
Horseshit.
Cersei's just trying
to frighten us.

509
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,570
I hope it's true.

510
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,620
If she lays siege
to King's Landing,
prices will triple.

511
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,990
As long
as we get back there
before they start.

512
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,530
One more round.
It's a long ride.

513
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,990
Hot Pie:
Arry!

514
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,200
Hello, Hot Pie.

515
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,530
Sit down.

516
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,200
Who's that for?

517
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,700
Mm. This is good.

518
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,160
You think so?

519
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,910
The secret
is browning the butter
before making the dough.

520
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,870
Most people don't do that
'cause it takes up
too much time.

521
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,490
Mm, I didn't do that.

522
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,030
You've been making pies?

523
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,370
One or two.

524
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,370
I can't believe you're here.

525
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:24,820
Did you meet the big lady?

526
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:27,820
- Big lady?
- The lady knight?

527
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:30,030
You know,
I figured she was a knight
'cause she had armor on.

528
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:33,870
She was looking
for your sister,
but I told her about you.

529
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,370
Did she ever find you?

530
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,320
She found me.

531
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,870
What happened to you, Arry?

532
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:56,370
You got any ale?

533
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,910
- Where you heading?
- King's Landing.

534
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,410
- Why?
- Heard Cersei's
queen now.

535
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,990
Heard she blew up
the Great Sept.

536
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,570
That must have been
something to see.

537
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,370
- Boom.
- Mm.

538
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,570
I can't believe
someone would do that.

539
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,120
Cersei would do that.

540
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,320
I thought you'd be
heading for Winterfell.

541
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,450
Why would I go there?
The Boltons have it.

542
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,910
No, the Boltons are dead.

543
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,280
What?

544
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,450
Jon Snow came down
from Castle Black
with a wildling army

545
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,240
and won the Battle
of the Bastards.

546
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,660
He's King of the North now.

547
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,450
You're lying.

548
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:48,320
Why would I lie about that?

549
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,780
He's your brother, right?

550
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,120
Thanks for the pie.

551
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,030
Friends don't pay.

552
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,320
Can't believe
I thought you were a boy.

553
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,240
You're pretty.

554
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,450
Thanks.

555
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,870
Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.

556
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,660
Try not to get killed.

557
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,070
Ah, I won't.

558
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,320
I'm like you, Arry.

559
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,990
I'm a survivor.

560
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,320
200 miles to King's Landing.

561
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,990
One bottle of rum.
You think we'll make it?

562
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,740
Come in.

563
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,200
A raven, my king,
from the Citadel.

564
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,740
Jon:
This message was sent
to me by Samwell Tarly.

565
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:27,070
He was my brother
at the Night's Watch,

566
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:31,620
a man I trust as much
as anyone in this world.

567
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,410
He's discovered proof
that Dragonstone

568
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,240
sits on a mountain
of dragonglass.

569
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:45,570
I received this a few days ago

570
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,200
from Dragonstone.

571
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:51,200
It was sent to me
by Tyrion Lannister.

572
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,570
He is now
Hand of the Queen
to Daenerys Targaryen.

573
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:00,620
She intends to
take the Iron Throne
from Cersei Lannister.

574
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,530
She has a powerful army
at her back

575
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:06,410
and, if this message
is to be believed,

576
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,700
three dragons.

577
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,450
Jon: Lord Tyrion
has invited me
to Dragonstone

578
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,200
to meet with Daenerys.

579
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:16,950
And I'm going to accept.

580
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,280
Man: Accept?!

581
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,740
We need
this dragonglass,
my lords!

582
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,700
We know
that dragonglass
can destroy

583
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,620
both white walkers
and their army.

584
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:32,160
We need to mine it
and turn it into weapons.

585
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,530
But more importantly,
we need allies!

586
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:39,820
The Night King's army
grows larger by the day.

587
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,570
We can't defeat them on our own.

588
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,410
We don't have the numbers.

589
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:47,120
Daenerys has her own army
and she has dragonfire.

590
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,410
I need to try
and persuade her
to fight with us.

591
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,530
Ser Davos and I will ride
for White Harbor tomorrow,

592
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,950
then sail for Dragonstone.

593
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:58,870
Have you forgotten
what happened to
our grandfather?

594
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,070
The Mad King invited him
to King's Landing

595
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,370
- and roasted him alive.
- I know that.

596
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:06,490
She is here to
reclaim the Iron Throne
and the Seven Kingdoms.

597
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,490
The North is one
of those seven kingdoms.

598
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:11,320
This isn't an invitation;
it's a trap.

599
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,620
It could be,
but I don't believe
Tyrion would do that.

600
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,990
You know him.
He's a good man.

601
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:20,820
Your Grace, with respect,
I must agree with Lady Sansa.

602
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:23,910
I remember the Mad King
all too well.

603
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,660
A Targaryen cannot be trusted.

604
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,870
- Nor can a Lannister.
- All: Yeah!

605
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:32,320
Aye. We called
your brother king.

606
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,240
And then he rode south
and lost his kingdom.

607
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,030
Winter is here, Your Grace.

608
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,910
We need
the King in the North
in the North.

609
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:46,240
Men: Aye!

610
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,990
You all crowned me your king.

611
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:01,200
I never wanted it.

612
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,660
I never asked for it.

613
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:07,950
But I accepted it
because the North
is my home.

614
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:12,240
It's part of me,
and I will never
stop fighting for it,

615
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,660
no matter the odds.

616
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:18,320
But the odds are against us.

617
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:24,530
None of you have seen
the Army of the Dead.
None of you.

618
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:28,570
We can never hope
to defeat them alone.

619
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,580
We need allies, powerful allies.

620
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:36,410
I know it's a risk.

621
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,620
But I have to take it.

622
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,370
Then send an emissary.
Don't go yourself.

623
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:43,910
Daenerys is a queen.

624
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,240
Only a king can
convince her to help us.

625
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,030
It has to be me.

626
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,990
You're abandoning your people!

627
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,780
You're abandoning your home.

628
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,700
I'm leaving both in good hands.

629
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,120
- Whose?
- Yours.

630
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,620
You are my sister.

631
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,700
You're the only Stark
in Winterfell.

632
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:04,620
Until I return,
the North is yours.

633
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,740
Littlefinger:
I delivered his bones myself.

634
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,910
Presented them to Lady Catelyn

635
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,410
as a gesture of goodwill
from Tyrion Lannister.

636
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,240
Seems like a lifetime ago.

637
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,580
Do give Lord Tyrion my best
when you see him.

638
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,950
I was sorry when he died.

639
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:51,660
Your father and I
had our differences,
but he loved Cat very much.

640
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,870
So did I.

641
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,320
She wasn't fond of you, was she?

642
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,280
Well, it appears she vastly
underestimated you.

643
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:08,740
Your father
and brothers are gone,

644
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,780
yet here you stand,
King in the North.

645
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,490
Last best hope
against the coming storm.

646
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,660
You don't belong down here.

647
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,450
Forgive me.

648
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,700
We haven't ever
talked... properly.

649
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,200
I wanted to remedy that.

650
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,370
I have nothing to say to you.

651
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,450
Not even "thank you"?

652
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:42,700
If it weren't for me,
you'd have been slaughtered
on that battlefield.

653
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,070
You have many enemies,
my king, but I swear to you,
I'm not one of them.

654
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,740
I love Sansa,

655
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,410
as I loved her mother.

656
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,240
Touch my sister,
and I'll kill you myself.

657
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,870
- Man: Ready?
- Man #2: Ready?

658
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:38,910
Man #2:
Ready!

659
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,530
Come on.

660
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:49,280
- Man: Yah!
- Man #2: Come on!

661
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,200
Nymeria?

662
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,910
Nymeria, it's me, Arya.

663
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:05,240
I'm heading north, girl.

664
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,280
Back to Winterfell.
I'm finally going home.

665
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,070
Come with me.

666
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,700
Come with me.

667
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:56,450
That's not you.

668
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,280
Nym:
You can't have them all.
It's not fair.

669
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,700
Obara:
I'm oldest.

670
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,820
Mama will want Cersei
for herself.

671
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,820
She's not my mama.

672
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:22,910
You can have Cersei.

673
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:25,450
I want the Mountain.

674
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:27,570
The Mountain killed Father.

675
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,320
He'll crush you with one hand.

676
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,070
Father got careless.
That's what Mama says.

677
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:34,280
Will you shut up about Mama?

678
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,870
"Mama, Mama, Mama."

679
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:39,740
Maybe I'll kill you both
before we take King's Landing.

680
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,280
And then I won't have to share.

681
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,990
Both:
"Mama!"

682
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:48,990
How can you drink this piss?

683
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:51,120
When we reach Sunspear,

684
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,660
I'll treat you to a Dornish red.

685
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,070
The best in the world.

686
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:57,490
Have you ever been to Dorne?

687
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:59,490
A few times.

688
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:00,870
Never stayed long.

689
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,410
A boy in every port?

690
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:04,990
A boy, a girl.

691
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:07,910
Depends on the port.

692
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,740
Could we get some more?

693
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:16,910
I thought it wasn't for you.

694
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:19,200
I'm developing a taste for it.

695
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,990
- He's not your servant.
- It's fine.

696
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:29,700
So, you're going to be
Queen of the Iron Islands.

697
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,530
Once I kill my uncle.

698
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:33,990
And what will you be, handsome?

699
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:35,700
Whatever my queen commands.

700
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,530
He'll be my advisor,
my protector.

701
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:41,780
Oh, I see.

702
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,200
Your protector.

703
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:47,490
So, if someone gets
too close to you...

704
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:49,280
He might have to intervene.

705
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,070
To hold that person back.

706
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:53,740
Until they've made
their intentions known.

707
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,030
Why are you standing
all the way over there, then?

708
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,660
A foreign invasion is underway.

709
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,410
Leave him be.

710
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,780
Seems like you
don't need a protector.

711
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:16,700
Stay here.

712
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,660
Man: We're under attack!

713
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,410
Euron.

714
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,660
You mother's below deck.
Keep her safe.

715
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,240
Aah!

716
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:05,070
Yah!

717
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,740
Aah!

718
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:31,120
Yah!

719
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,660
Yah!

720
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,820
Kill us.

721
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:55,280
Get it over with.

722
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:21,490
Give your uncle a kiss.

723
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,240
Euron:
Little Theon!

724
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,240
Ah, come on,
you cockless coward.

725
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:22,990
I have her.

726
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,580
Come and get her.

727
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:21,410
I was born
to rule the Seven Kingdoms.

728
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:22,580
And I will.

730

The war's already begun.
I've drawn first blood.

Cersei will be ready.
