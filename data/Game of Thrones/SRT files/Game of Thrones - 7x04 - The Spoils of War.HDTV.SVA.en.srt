00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,580
Hold the waggon!

4
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,940
You've just won the biggest prize in the world.

5
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,780
What could you possibly have to be upset about?

6
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,320
Come on, you can tell me.

7
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,860
The Queen of Thorns give you one
last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?

8
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,370
I will save my confessions
for the High Septon.

9
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,050
-There is no more High Septon.
-No there isn't, is there?

10
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,100
There is still the question of my prize.

11
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,500
That's a lot of money I just gave you.

12
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,320
It's not a castle.

13
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,530
How about that one?
It's available.

14
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,290
You don't want Highgarden.

15
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,790
-I beg to differ.
-We are at war.

16
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,800
Daenerys Targaryen can come and take it
back the day after you move in.

17
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,950
Besides, think of the upkeep.

18
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,260
The more you own,
the more it weighs you down.

19
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,590
Oh! Is that why you are so fucking glum,eh?

20
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,770
All your new riches weighing you down?

21
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,070
Move it!

22
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,700
They are not mine.
These all belong to the Iron Bank.

23
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,650
-We pay our debts.
-Right, just not to me.

24
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,440
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of

25
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,810
whatever nameless shitheap you're from,

26
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,080
with a saddlebag full of gold,
complaining about not getting paid.

27
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,080
When we win this war, all the castles in the
Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from.

28
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,970
with no one left to take them away from you.

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,940
Yes, I am sure Queen Cersei's reign
will be quiet & peaceful

30
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,630
-Oh! Stranger things have happened.
-Like what?

31
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,050
The granaries are being emptied.
I'll load it into wagons, my lord.

32
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,320
And the current harvest?

33
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,330
We have teams of men collecting it
from all the farms in the Reach.

34
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,700
Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarlys

35
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,870
and help them accelerate this process?

36
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,160
I'm not much for shoveling wheat.

37
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,060
No. But, motivating reluctant farmers
to hand over their harvest,

38
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,430
I bet you're going to have
a real talent for that.

39
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,030
My Lord.

40
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,950
My Lord.

41
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,210
My Lord.

42
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,990
I must say I don't think the Iron Bank

43
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,940
has ever had a debt of this magnitude

44
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,980
repaid in a single installment.

45
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,360
I always considered your father
a very effective and efficient man,

46
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,990
but you appear to be
redefining those terms entirely.

47
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,910
You're too kind, my Lord.

48
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,530
I'm neither kind nor a lord, Your Grace.

49
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,490
I'm merely an instrument of
the institution I represent.

50
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,060
It's well-being is a matter
of arithmetic, not sentiment.

51
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,830
And the current arithmetic is outstanding.

52
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,240
-The gold...
-is on it's way.

53
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,100
My brother is supervising
its transportation himself.

54
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,600
Some at the Iron Bank
will be disappointed.

55
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,280
They've grown rather fond
of your interest payments.

56
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,670
We must devise a way to raise their spirits.

57
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,800
Yes, perhaps we could be of
assistance in some current venture.

58
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,880
My only venture at this moment is

59
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,980
re-estabilishing control over this continent

60
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,860
and every person on it.

61
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,360
I see a great deal of potential in that venture.

62
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,960
I imagine it will require outside investment.

63
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,800
It will, indeed.

64
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,000
I need to expand my armies, my navies.

65
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,820
My Hand, Qyburn,

66
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,330
has made overtures
to the Golden Company in Essos.

67
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,840
I know them well.

68
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,790
They have helped us recover significant sums

69
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,430
from parties who had fallen to deep arrears.

70
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,710
It's good to hear.

71
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,740
I too would like them to recover
some things that belong to me.

72
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,600
Rest assured, Your Grace...

73
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,500
You can count on the Iron Bank's support...

74
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,390
..as soon as the gold arrives.

75
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,780
This is for you.

76
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,180
The last man who wielded it
meant to cut your throat,

77
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,020
but your mother fought him off.

78
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,120
The other dagger,

79
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,590
the one that took her life.

80
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,720
I would have stopped
that dagger with my own heart

81
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,900
If I could have.

82
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,780
I wasn't there for her
when she needed me most.

83
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,320
But I am here for her now

84
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,260
to do what she would have done,

85
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,850
to protect her children.

86
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,600
anything I can do for you, Brandon,

87
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,700
you need only ask.

88
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,150
Do you know who this belonged to?

89
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,410
No.

90
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,190
That very question was what started
the war of the Five Kings.

91
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,710
In a way that dagger made
you what you are today.

92
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,100
Forced from your home,
driven out to the wilds beyond The Wall.

93
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,510
I imagine you've seen things

94
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,240
most men wouldn't believe.

95
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,030
To go through all of that and..
make your way home again

96
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,940
only to find such chaos in the world.

97
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,240
-I can only imagine.
-Chaos is a ladder.

98
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,020
I'm sorry to have disturbed you,
Lord Stark.

99
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,070
I'm not Lord Stark.

100
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,700
What's that?

101
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,390
Maester Wolkan built it for me
so I can move around more easily.

102
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,900
It's a very good idea.

103
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,310
You're leaving.

104
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,920
I don't want to leave you, but when...

105
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,890
..when they come,
I need to be with my family.

106
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,310
And you're safe.

107
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,840
Safe as anyone can be now.

108
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,340
You don't need me anymore.

109
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,180
No, I don't.

110
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,670
That's all you've got to say?

111
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,940
Thank you.

112
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,600
Thank you?

113
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,910
For helping me.

114
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,950
My brother died for you.

115
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,900
Hodor and Summer died for you.

116
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,890
I almost died for you.

117
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,110
-Bran...
-I'm not really...

118
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,180
Not anymore.

119
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,050
I remember what it felt
like to be Brandon Stark.

120
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,160
But I remember so much else now.

121
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,390
You died in that cave.

122
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,110
Yes! The kitchen girl...
the redhead with the band.

123
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,060
The only thing in the kitchen
that you put your ... is the liver.

124
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,650
Hello. Where are you goin'?

125
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,050
In there.

126
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,170
-I live here.
-Fuck off.

127
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,100
I am Arya Stark. This is my home.

128
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,970
[laughs]

129
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,500
Arya Stark is dead.

130
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,380
Send for Maester Luwin or Ser Rodrik.

131
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,310
-They will tell you who I am.
-There is no Rodrik here.

132
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,020
The Maester's name Wolkan.

133
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,910
Go ask Jon Snow then,
the King in the North.

134
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,950
-He's my brother.
-He's a thousand miles away.

135
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,220
It's cold and we're busy.
So, you know, better fuck off.

136
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,440
If Jon's gone,
who's in charge of Winterfell?

137
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,920
The Lady of Winterfell?

138
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,750
-Lady Stark.
-Which Lady Stark?

139
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:14,640
You tell us,
you are the one impersonating her sister.

140
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,690
Tell Sansa her sister's home.

141
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,610
Lady Sansa is too busy
to waste a breath on you.

142
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,950
Just like us.
So for the last time, FUCK OFF.

143
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,570
I'm getting into this castle
one way or another.

144
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,180
If I'm not who I say I am,
I won't last long.

145
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,940
But if am, and Sansa
finds out you turned me away...

146
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,440
All right. You sit there.

147
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:52,930
Right there.

148
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,740
Don't move!

149
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,600
Alright,

150
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,300
Go tell Lady Stark. I'll watch her.

151
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,370
I ain't telling Lady Stark. You go tell..

152
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,930
-You are going to tell her.
-I'm not.

153
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,850
Because if you don't I'm gonna hit you
right in the fucking face as hard as I can.

154
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,240
We told her to wait.

155
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,150
We were standing right next to her and...

156
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,120
When we turned around,
she was gone, milady.

157
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,960
She is nothing, some winter town girl.

158
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,820
-She comes in asking for Ser Rodrik... and

159
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,920
Maester Luwin, yeah. And...

160
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,540
Don't trouble yourself over her, milady.
We will find her.

161
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,410
You don't have to.

162
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,950
I know where she is.

163
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,820
Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?

164
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,300
Yes.

165
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,180
You shouldn't have run
from the guards.

166
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,280
I didn't run.

167
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,860
You need better guards.

168
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,320
It suits you... Lady Stark.

169
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,180
-Jon left you in charge?
-He did.

170
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,020
I hope he comes back soon.

171
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,840
I remember how happy he was to see me,
and when he sees you,

172
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,290
his heart will probably stop.

173
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,560
It doesn't look like him.

174
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,920
Should've been carved
by someone who knew his face.

175
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,840
Everyone who knew his face is dead.

176
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,980
We're not.

177
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,470
They say you killed Joffrey.

178
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,700
Did you?

179
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,960
I wish I had.

180
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,000
Hmmm.

181
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:48,850
Me too.

182
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,170
I was angry when I heard
someone else had done it.

183
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,900
However long my list go,
he was always first.

184
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,230
-Your list?
-Of people I'm going to kill.

185
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,420
[laughs]

186
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,200
How did you get back to Winterfell?

187
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,840
It's a long story.
I imagine yours is too.

188
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,180
Yes.

189
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,020
Not a very pleasant one.

190
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,990
Mine neither.

191
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,210
But our stories aren't over yet.

192
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,060
No, they're not.

193
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,070
Arya.

194
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,560
Bran is home too.

195
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,930
You came home.

196
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,220
I saw you at the crossroads.

197
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,790
-You saw me?
-I see quite a lot now.

198
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,990
Bran has visions.

199
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,380
I thought you might go to King's Landing.

200
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,780
So did I.

201
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,370
Why would you go back there?

202
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,840
Cersei's on her list of names.

203
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,550
Who else is on your list?

204
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,100
Most of them are dead already.

205
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,720
Where did you get this?

206
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,190
Littlefinger gave it to me.

207
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,700
Littlefinger? He's here?

208
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,410
He's declared for House Stark.
Why would he give you a dagger?

209
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,840
He thought I'd want it.

210
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,220
-Why?
-Because it was meant to kill me.

211
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,760
The cut-throat?

212
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,730
After your fall?

213
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,740
Why would a cut-throat
have a Valyrian steel dagger?

214
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,410
Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.

215
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,560
He's not a generous man.

216
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,740
He wouldn't give you anything unless
he thought he was getting something back.

217
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,520
-It doesn't matter.
-What do you mean "It doesn't matter"?

218
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,580
I don't want it.

219
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,890
Are you sure?

220
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,830
-It's Valyrian steel.
-It's wasted on a cripple.

221
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,680
Catelyn Stark would be proud.

222
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,500
You kept your vow.

223
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,990
-I did next to nothing.
-You're too hard on yourself, my lady.

224
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,810
I'm not a...!

225
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,690
Thank you, Podrick.

226
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,190
Your Grace, there is still
no word from the Unsullied.

227
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,270
Soon.

228
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,400
He will come back to you.

229
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,050
He better!

230
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,760
What happened?

231
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,310
Many things...

232
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,060
Many things?

233
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,880
Your Grace!

234
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,020
-

235
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,530
I wanted you to see it
before we start hacking it to bits.

236
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,210
Well, this is it..
All we'll ever need.

237
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,840
There is something else
I wanna show you, Your Grace.

238
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,590
The Children of the Forest made these.

239
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,580
When?

240
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,350
A very long time ago.

241
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:53,490
They were right here,
standing where we're standing.

242
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,400
Before there were Targaryens,
or Starks or Lannisters.

243
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,210
Maybe even before there were men.

244
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,810
No.

245
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,870
They were here together.

246
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,690
the Children and the First Men.

247
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,740
Doing what?
Fighting each other?

248
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,700
They fought together

249
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,350
against their common enemy.

250
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,420
Despite their differences,
despite their suspicions.

251
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,630
Together.

252
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,820
We need to do the same
if we are gonna survive.

253
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,860
Because the enemy is real.

254
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,500
It's always been real.

255
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,640
And you say can't defeat them

256
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,940
without my armies and my dragons.

257
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,140
No, I don't think I can.

258
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,690
I will fight for you.

259
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,650
I will fight for the North.

260
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,330
When you bend the knee.

261
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,820
My people

262
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,650
won't accept a southern ruler.

263
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,110
Not after everything they have suffered.

264
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,940
They will if their King does.

265
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,640
They chose you to lead them.

266
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,800
They chose you to protect them.

267
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,350
Isn't their survival more
important than your pride?

268
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,660
What is it?

269
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,820
We took Casterly Rock.

270
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,770
That's very good to hear.

271
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,620
Isn't it?

272
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,270
You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves.

273
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,600
You will stay.

274
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,660
All my allies are gone.

275
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,410
-They've been taken from me
while I've been sitting here on this island.
-You still have the largest army.

276
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,600
...who won't be able to eat because
Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.

277
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,540
Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.

278
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,660
We still have enough ships to carry
the Dothraki to the mainland.

279
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,090
Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.

280
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,530
We have a plan. It's still the right plan.

281
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,190
The right plan!

282
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:16,810
Your strategy has lost us
Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach.

283
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,570
-If I have underestimated our enemies--
-Our enemies?

284
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,650
Your family you mean!

285
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,640
Perhaps you don't want to
hurt them after all.

286
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,730
Enough of the clever plans.
I have three large dragons.

287
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,740
I am going to fly them to the Red Keep.

288
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,320
We've discussed this.

289
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,810
My enemies are in the Red Keep.

290
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,510
What kind of a Queen am I
if I am not willing to risk my life to fight them?

291
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,710
A smart one.

292
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,690
What do you think I should do?

293
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,480
-I would never presume--
-I'm at war.

294
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,540
I'm losing.

295
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,890
What do you think I should do?

296
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,680
I never thought that
dragons would exist again.

297
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,870
No one did.

298
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,180
The people who follow you

299
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,950
know that you made
something impossible happen.

300
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:28,020
Maybe that helps them believe that you
can make other impossible things happen.

301
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,290
Build a world that's different
from the shit one they've always known.

302
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:38,410
But if you use them to
melt castles and burn cities

303
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,970
You're not different.

304
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,280
You're just more of the same.

305
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,340
Don't lunge.

306
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,770
Don't go where your enemy leads you.

307
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:18,930
Up.

308
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,300
-And don't--
-Don't fight someone like her in the first place.

309
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,190
Nice sword.

310
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,110
Very nice dagger.

311
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,400
They haven't contributed the right
amount of grain to the stores

312
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,180
that I am afraid they'll have to make do
with what they brought. We can't--

313
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,440
It's been a while since I trained.

314
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,250
I can go and find the master-of-arms here,
my lady.

315
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,010
He didn't beat The Hound.

316
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,830
You did.

317
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,600
I want to train with you.

318
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,850
You swore to serve both my
mother's daughters, didn't you?

319
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,090
Move aside, Podrick.

320
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,550
You can't use that, my lady.
It's too small.

321
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,570
I won't cut you.
Don't worry.

322
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,640
I'll try not to.

323
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,270
Who taught you how to do that?

324
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,260
No one.

325
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,290
-What do you think of her?
-Who?

326
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,640
I believe you know of whom I speak.

327
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,600
I think she has a good heart.

328
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,720
A good heart?

329
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,590
I've noticed you staring at a good heart.

330
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,670
There's no time for that.

331
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,340
I saw the Night King, Davos.
I looked into his eyes.

332
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,640
How many men do we have
in the North to fight him?

333
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,170
-10,000 less?
-Fewer.

334
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,220
What?

335
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,420
Speaking of good hearts.
Missandei of Naath.

336
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,740
Ser Davos, Lord Snow.

337
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,410
King Snow, isn't it?

338
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,820
No, that doesn't sound right.

339
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,870
-King Jon?
-It doesn't matter.

340
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,690
Forgive me.
But may I ask a question?

341
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,700
Of course.

342
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,990
Your name is Jon Snow,

343
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,290
but your father's name was Ned Stark.

344
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,400
I'm a bastard.

345
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,170
My mother and father weren't married.

346
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,530
Is the custom different in Naath?

347
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:30,630
We don't have marriage in Naath,
so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.

348
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,060
It sounds... liberating.

349
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,920
Why did you leave your homeland?

350
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,320
I was stolen away by slavers.

351
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,410
I'm sorry.

352
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,010
If I may,

353
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:47,110
how did a slave girl come
to advice Daenerys Targaryen?

354
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,410
She bought me from my master
and set me free.

355
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,600
That was good of her.

356
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,820
Of course you are serving her now,
aren't you?

357
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,790
I serve my Queen because
I want to serve my Queen.

358
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,540
Because I believe in her.

359
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,070
And if you wanted to sail
home to Naath tomorrow?

360
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,140
Then she would give me a ship
and wish me good fortune.

361
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,660
You believe that?

362
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,650
I know it.

363
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,210
All of us who came with her from Essos

364
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,680
We believe in her.

365
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,090
She's not our Queen because
she's the daughter of some king we never knew.

366
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,410
She is the Queen we chose.

367
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,290
Will you forgive me if I switch sides?

368
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,940
Is that a Greyjoy ship?

369
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,300
Stop!

370
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,440
Jon.

371
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,420
I didn't know you were here.

372
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,070
Sansa...

373
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,560
Is she alright?

374
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,100
What you did for her

375
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,280
is the only reason
I am not killing you.

376
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,340
We heard your
uncle attacked your fleet.

377
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,380
We thought you were dead.

378
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,000
I should be.

379
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,690
Your sister?

380
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:07,660
Euron has her.

381
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,920
I came to ask the Queen
to help me get her back.

382
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,830
The Queen is gone.

383
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,060
Where did she go?

384
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,130
-All the gold's safely through
the gates of King's Landing.
-Good.

385
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,960
We need to get the last of these wagons over
the Blackwater Rush before night fall.

386
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,910
If the head of the line is ambushed,
the tail will never be ought to reinforced in time.

387
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:52,540
We are stretched a bit thin.

388
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,950
With your permission,

389
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,370
flogging stragglers
has a marked effect on mobility.

390
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,890
Let's give them fair warning first.

391
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,040
These men fought well at High Garden.

392
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,210
-Sir Jaime.
-Rickon.

393
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,060
Dickon.

394
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,780
I hear you fought bravely at High Garden.

395
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,220
Your first battle?

396
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,520
And...?

397
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,830
It was glorious.

398
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,810
Come on, your father's not here.

399
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,940
All my life we've been placed at House Tyrell.

400
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,130
I knew some of those men, hunting with them.

401
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,300
They didn't deserve to die.

402
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:55,660
But Lady Olenna chose to betray her Queen
and supported Targaryen girl.

403
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:56,720
So here we are.

404
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,950
I didn't expect her to smell like that.

405
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,130
Men shit themselves when they die.

406
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,550
Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?

407
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,250
Well I learnt it when I was five.

408
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,330
What?

409
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,510
Listen.

410
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,170
Spears and shields!
Spears and shields!

411
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,470
-What is it?
-Get in line!

412
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:40,100
Spears and shields!
Spears and shields!

413
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,420
In line now!

414
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,590
Fall now!

415
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,770
Come on, lads!

416
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,980
Halt those wagons! Fall align!

417
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,420
Fall align!

418
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:55,710
Grab those spears!

419
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,140
Shield wall!

420
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,970
Fill the gaps!

421
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,740
In tight!

422
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,840
In line, boys!

423
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,840
[Dothraki shouting]

424
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,280
Spears out!

425
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:56,970
Spears out!

426
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,850
Hold the line!

427
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,070
Get back to King's Landing.

428
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:14,330
I'm not abandoning my army.
-You're the Commander, not a damned infantry man.

429
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,120
Those fuckers are about to swamp us.

430
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,130
We can hold them off.

431
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,850
Dracarys!

432
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,430
Hold the line!

433
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,600
Hold the line.

434
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,370
Hold the line.

435
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,740
-Archers!
-Archers!

436
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,400
Archers, with me!

437
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,000
...to the line!

438
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,360
-Nock!
-Nock!

439
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,300
-Loose!
-Loose!

440
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,290
-Qyburn's Scorpion is over there.
-Go get it then.

441
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,080
I can't shoot with one hand.

442
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,180
Come on!

443
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,700
Where are you?

444
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,150
---

445
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,880
Take cover!

446
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:58,900
Come on, you fucker!

447
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,250
Dracarys!

448
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,730
Flee, you idiot.

449
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:17,670
Come on boy. Come on!

450
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:28,790
You fool.

451
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:30,430
You fucking idiot!
