We've been here

170

My apologies.

171
00:17:59,504 --> 00:18:01,170
We are all
facing a unique--

Theon!

173
00:18:03,213 --> 00:18:05,128
I have your sister.

174
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:07,545
If you don't submit
to me here, now...

175
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,338
I'll kill her.

176
00:18:16,088 --> 00:18:18,544
I think we ought to begin
with larger concerns.

177
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:20,753
Then why
are you talking?

178
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:22,962
You're the smallest
concern here.

179
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:27,212
Do you remember
when we discussed dwarf jokes?

180
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:28,961
His wasn't even good.

181
00:18:28,962 --> 00:18:30,295
He explained it
at the end.

182
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:31,836
Never explain.
It always ruins it.

183
00:18:31,837 --> 00:18:33,337
We don't even
let your kind live

184
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:36,544
in the Iron Islands,
you know?

185
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:38,753
We kill you at birth.

186
00:18:38,754 --> 00:18:40,795
An act of mercy
for the parents.

187
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:43,461
Perhaps you ought
to sit down.

188
00:18:43,462 --> 00:18:44,920
Why?

189
00:18:44,921 --> 00:18:47,129
Sit down or leave.

191
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:11,337
We are a group of people
who do not like one another,

192
00:19:11,338 --> 00:19:13,879
as this recent
demonstration has shown.

193
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:17,669
We have suffered
at each other's hands.

194
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,045
We have lost people we love
at each other's hands.

195
00:19:21,046 --> 00:19:23,337
If all we wanted
was more of the same,

196
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:25,586
there would be no need
for this gathering.

197
00:19:25,587 --> 00:19:28,628
We are entirely capable
of waging war against each other

198
00:19:28,629 --> 00:19:30,337
without meeting
face-to-face.

199
00:19:30,338 --> 00:19:32,212
So instead, we should settle
our differences

200
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,878
and live together in harmony
for the rest of our days?

201
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:36,295
We all know
that will never happen.

202
00:19:36,296 --> 00:19:37,670
Then why are we here?

203
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:43,046
This isn't about
living in harmony.

204
00:19:44,545 --> 00:19:46,337
It's just
about living.

205
00:19:46,338 --> 00:19:48,920
The same thing
is coming for all of us.

206
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,961
A general you can't
negotiate with.

207
00:19:50,962 --> 00:19:54,711
An army that doesn't
leave corpses behind on the battlefield.

208
00:19:54,712 --> 00:19:58,295
Lord Tyrion tells me
a million people live in this city.

209
00:19:58,296 --> 00:20:01,711
They're about to become a million
more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.

210
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:04,420
I imagine for most of them
it would be an improvement.

211
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:10,004
This is serious.

212
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:13,170
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't.

213
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,003
I don't think
it's serious at all.

214
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:16,461
I think it's
another bad joke.

215
00:20:16,462 --> 00:20:19,212
If my brother Jaime
has informed me correctly,

216
00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:20,836
you're asking me
for a truce.

217
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:23,379
Yes.
That's all.

218
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:26,462
That's all?

and stand down

on your monster hunt.

Or while you solidify
and expand your position.

222
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:38,087
Hard for me to know which it is
with my armies pulled back

223
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:41,753
until you return and march on my  capital
with four times the men.

224
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:46,088
Your capital will be safe
until the northern threat is dealt with.

225

The word of
a would-be usurper.

There is no conversation

228

the last 50 years.

00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:51,045
- You spoke with her?
- At her until she kicked me out.

337
00:30:51,046 --> 00:30:54,128
She thinks I was an idiot
to trust you.

338
00:30:54,129 --> 00:30:56,253
A lot of people
seem to think that, actually.

339
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:57,878
I'm about to step
into a room

340
00:30:57,879 --> 00:30:59,669
with the most murderous
woman in the world

341
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:03,586
who's already tried
to kill me twice, that I know of.

342
00:31:03,587 --> 00:31:05,213
Who's an idiot?

343
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:11,087
I suppose we should
say goodbye,

344
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:12,670
one idiot to another.

345
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,503
I shouldn't
be surprised, I suppose.

346
00:32:13,504 --> 00:32:15,295
She's your kind
of woman--

347
00:32:15,296 --> 00:32:17,836
a foreign whore
who doesn't know her place.

348
00:32:17,837 --> 00:32:21,628
A foreign whore you can't abduct,
beat, or intimidate.

349
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:23,337
That must be
difficult for you.

350
00:32:23,338 --> 00:32:25,795
So you bring her here
with her pet Northerner,

351
00:32:25,796 --> 00:32:26,854
whom you've convinced
to bow down before her.

352
00:32:26,855 --> 00:32:27,708
I didn't know about that.

353
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,795
And now you've got them both
working towards the same goal,

354
00:32:29,796 --> 00:32:31,920
the goal you've worked towards
your entire life...

355
00:32:31,921 --> 00:32:35,003
- Cersei, I didn't know.
- ...the destruction of this family.

356
00:32:35,004 --> 00:32:38,337
I am the one preventing that
from happening.

357
00:32:38,338 --> 00:32:40,878
Daenerys didn't want
to debate and negotiate.

358
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:42,337
She didn't want
to bring you words.

359
00:32:42,338 --> 00:32:44,295
She wanted to bring you
fire and blood

360
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,419
until I advised her
otherwise.

361
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,212
I don't want
to destroy our family.

362
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:50,170
I never have.

363
00:32:50,171 --> 00:32:51,628
You killed our father.

364
00:32:51,629 --> 00:32:53,253
After he sentenced me
to death

365
00:32:53,254 --> 00:32:55,836
for a crime I didn't commit,
yes, I killed him.

366
00:32:55,837 --> 00:32:57,503
Hate me for it
if you want.

367
00:32:57,504 --> 00:32:59,836
I hate myself for it
in spite of what he was,

368
00:32:59,837 --> 00:33:02,295
in spite of
what he did to me.

369
00:33:02,296 --> 00:33:04,045
Oh, poor little man.

370
00:33:04,046 --> 00:33:05,753
Your papa
was mean to you.

371
00:33:05,754 --> 00:33:09,795
Do you have any idea what you did
when you fired that crossbow?

372
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:11,628
You left us open.

373
00:33:11,629 --> 00:33:13,212
You laid us bare
for the vultures,

374
00:33:13,213 --> 00:33:16,753
and the vultures came
and tore us apart.

375
00:33:16,754 --> 00:33:18,419
You may not
have killed Joffrey,

376
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,337
but you killed Myrcella,
you killed Tommen.

377
00:33:20,338 --> 00:33:22,378
No one would've touched them
if Father was here.

378
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:22,973
No one would have dared--

379
00:33:22,997 --> 00:33:24,961
I have never been more sorry
about anything.

380
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:26,669
I will not hear it,
not from you.

381
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,420
I will not hear it!

382
00:33:31,379 --> 00:33:33,711
All right.

383
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:35,170
You love your family,

384
00:33:35,171 --> 00:33:38,253
and I have
destroyed it.

385
00:33:38,254 --> 00:33:41,003
I will always
be a threat.

386
00:33:41,004 --> 00:33:42,338
So put an end to me.

387
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:53,378
If it weren't for me,
you'd have a mother.

388
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:56,128
If it weren't for me,
you'd have a father.

389
00:33:56,129 --> 00:33:57,461
If it weren't for me,

390
00:33:57,462 --> 00:33:59,544
you'd have
two beautiful children.

391
00:33:59,545 --> 00:34:01,711
I've thought
about killing you

392
00:34:01,712 --> 00:34:03,379
more times
than I can count.

393
00:34:05,088 --> 00:34:07,379
Do it!
Say the word.

396
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:19,295
I am more sorry about the children
than you could ever know.

397
00:35:19,296 --> 00:35:22,461
- I will not--
- I don't care. I loved them.

398
00:35:22,462 --> 00:35:24,337
You know I did.

399
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:27,837
You know it in your heart
if there's anything left of it.

400
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,670
It doesn't matter.

401
00:35:33,629 --> 00:35:37,253
Your love doesn't matter.
Your feelings don't matter.

402
00:35:37,254 --> 00:35:39,419
I don't care
why you did what you did.

403
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,295
I only care
what it cost us.

404
00:35:42,296 --> 00:35:43,670
It cost us our future.

405
00:35:45,338 --> 00:35:47,461
If there's no future,
then why are we here?

406
00:35:47,462 --> 00:35:49,461
Why did you
allow me to come?

407
00:35:49,462 --> 00:35:52,503
Not to help my enemies
collaborate in my destruction.

408
00:35:52,504 --> 00:35:54,253
Yes, no,
not what you hoped for,

409
00:35:54,254 --> 00:35:56,796
but you must have
hoped for something.

410
00:35:57,837 --> 00:36:00,378
What did you hope for?

411
00:36:00,379 --> 00:36:04,045
- To make Jon Snow submit to your queen?
- Mm, not like this.

412
00:36:04,046 --> 00:36:06,419
But eventually, you want everyone
to bend the knee to her.

413
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,170
- Yes.
- Why?

414
00:36:08,171 --> 00:36:09,753
Because I think

415
00:36:09,754 --> 00:36:11,586
she will make the world
a better place.

416
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:13,504
You said she'd destroy
King's Landing.

417
00:36:15,712 --> 00:36:17,628
She knows herself.

418
00:36:17,629 --> 00:36:19,170
She chose an advisor

419
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:22,503
who would check her worst impulses
instead of feeding them.

420
00:36:22,504 --> 00:36:24,503
That's the difference
between you.

421
00:36:24,504 --> 00:36:26,711
I don't care about
checking my worst impulses.

422
00:36:26,712 --> 00:36:29,337
I don't care about
making the world a better place.

423
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:31,128
Hang the world.

424
00:36:31,129 --> 00:36:33,586
That thing
you dragged here,

425
00:36:33,587 --> 00:36:37,045
I know what it is,
I know what it means.

426
00:36:37,046 --> 00:36:39,253
And when it came at me,
I didn't think about the world.

427
00:36:39,254 --> 00:36:41,337
Not at all.

428
00:36:41,338 --> 00:36:42,920
As soon as
it opened its mouth,

429
00:36:42,921 --> 00:36:44,295
the world
disappeared for me,

430
00:36:44,296 --> 00:36:46,419
right down
its black throat.

431
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,795
All I could think about
was keeping those gnashing teeth

432
00:36:48,796 --> 00:36:50,337
away from the ones
who matter most,

433
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:52,128
away from my family.

434
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:55,753
Maybe Euron Greyjoy
had the right idea.

435
00:36:55,754 --> 00:36:58,544
Get on a boat,
take those who matter--

436
00:36:58,545 --> 00:36:59,712
You're pregnant.

No one is less happy
about this than I am.

439
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,296
I know.

440
00:37:38,962 --> 00:37:41,461
I respect
what you did.

441
00:37:41,462 --> 00:37:43,796
Wish you hadn't done it,
but I respect it.

442
00:37:54,462 --> 00:37:57,962
This place was the beginning
of the end for my family.

<font color="#0CEC0C">( speaking Valyrian )</font>

444
00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:06,296
A dragon
is not a slave.

445
00:38:09,129 --> 00:38:11,586
They were terrifying.

446
00:38:11,587 --> 00:38:13,296
Extraordinary.

447
00:38:14,712 --> 00:38:17,753
They filled people
with wonder and awe,

448
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,004
and we locked them
in here.

449
00:38:21,296 --> 00:38:22,837
They wasted away.

450
00:38:24,046 --> 00:38:26,337
They grew small.

451
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,962
And we grew small
as well.

452
00:38:30,296 --> 00:38:32,878
We weren't extraordinary
without them.

453
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:34,712
We were just like
everyone else.

454
00:38:39,754 --> 00:38:41,670
You're not like
everyone else.

455
00:38:47,545 --> 00:38:50,004
And your family
hasn't seen its end.

456
00:38:51,171 --> 00:38:52,795
You're still here.

457
00:38:52,796 --> 00:38:55,337
I can't
have children.

458
00:38:55,338 --> 00:38:56,920
Who told you that?

459
00:38:56,921 --> 00:38:59,878
The witch who
murdered my husband.

460
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,087
Has it occurred to you
she might not have been

461
00:39:02,088 --> 00:39:03,879
a reliable source
of information?

462
00:39:09,712 --> 00:39:11,836
You were right
from the beginning.

463
00:39:11,837 --> 00:39:15,046
If I had trusted you,
everything would be different.

464
00:39:19,129 --> 00:39:20,545
So, what now?

465
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:27,045
I can't forget what I saw
north of the Wall.

466
00:39:27,046 --> 00:39:28,961
And I can't pretend
that Cersei

467
00:39:28,962 --> 00:39:32,254
won't take back half the country
the moment I march north.

468
00:39:34,379 --> 00:39:36,879
It appears Tyrion's assessment
was correct.

469
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:40,379

And when
the Great War is over,

478
00:40:58,004 --> 00:41:01,337
perhaps you'll remember
I chose to help

479

with no promises
or assurances from any of you.

He's bent the knee.

493
00:41:53,962 --> 00:41:56,544
I've heard gossip

494
00:41:56,545 --> 00:42:00,544
that the Dragon Queen
is quite beautiful.

495
00:42:00,545 --> 00:42:02,754
What does that have to do
with anything?

496
00:42:05,046 --> 00:42:07,795
Jon is young
and unmarried.

497
00:42:07,796 --> 00:42:10,003
Daenerys is young
and unmarried.

498
00:42:10,004 --> 00:42:12,961
You think he wants
to marry her?

499
00:42:12,962 --> 00:42:16,212
An alliance
makes sense.

500
00:42:16,213 --> 00:42:18,420
Together, they'd be
difficult to defeat.

501
00:42:20,046 --> 00:42:23,046
He was named
King in the North.

502
00:42:25,462 --> 00:42:26,879
He can be unnamed.

503
00:42:30,712 --> 00:42:33,378
Even if I wanted to,
Arya would never go along.

504
00:42:33,379 --> 00:42:36,212
She always loved Jon
far more than she ever loved me,

505
00:42:36,213 --> 00:42:39,419
and she'd kill anyone
who betrayed her family.

506
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,420
You are family, too.

507
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,003
Would Arya really murder
her own sister?

508
00:42:46,004 --> 00:42:48,337
Do you know
what she is now?

509
00:42:48,338 --> 00:42:51,711
Do you know what
the Faceless Men are?

510
00:42:51,712 --> 00:42:53,920
Only by reputation.

511
00:42:53,921 --> 00:42:57,087
They worship
the God of Death, I believe.

512
00:42:57,088 --> 00:42:59,711
I never trust
godly men.

513
00:42:59,712 --> 00:43:01,212
They're killers.

514
00:43:01,213 --> 00:43:03,088
And Arya
was one of them.

515
00:43:07,962 --> 00:43:09,544
What do you think
she's after?

516
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,128
She's your sister.

517
00:43:12,129 --> 00:43:14,254
You know her far better
than I ever could.

518
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:22,544
Sometimes when I try to understand
a person's motives,

519
00:43:22,545 --> 00:43:24,462
I play a little game.

520
00:43:26,962 --> 00:43:28,962
I assume the worst.

521
00:43:31,962 --> 00:43:34,795
What's the worst reason
they could possibly have

522
00:43:34,796 --> 00:43:39,753
for saying what they say
and doing what they do?

523
00:43:39,754 --> 00:43:41,961
Then I ask myself,

524
00:43:41,962 --> 00:43:45,128
"How well does
that reason explain

525
00:43:45,129 --> 00:43:48,088
what they say
and what they do?"

526
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:51,461
So, tell me--

527
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,004
what's the worst thing
she could want?

528
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:01,836
She could
want me dead

529
00:44:01,837 --> 00:44:05,045
because she thinks
I wronged my family.

530
00:44:05,046 --> 00:44:07,338
Why did she come
to Winterfell?

531
00:44:10,545 --> 00:44:12,503
To kill me

532
00:44:12,504 --> 00:44:16,337
for marrying our enemies
and betraying my family.

533
00:44:16,338 --> 00:44:19,338
Why did she unearth the letter
Cersei made you write?

534
00:44:22,046 --> 00:44:26,128
To provide proof
of my betrayals.

535
00:44:26,129 --> 00:44:30,878
To provide justification
after she murders me.

536
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:34,544
And after
she murders you,

537
00:44:34,545 --> 00:44:37,213
what does she become?

538
00:44:42,712 --> 00:44:44,420
Lady of Winterfell.

539
00:44:56,587 --> 00:44:59,461
<font color="#D900D9">( waves crashing )</font>

540
00:44:59,462 --> 00:45:02,378
If we have the Dothraki
ride hard on the kingsroad,

541
00:45:02,379 --> 00:45:05,045
they'll arrive at Winterfell
within the fortnight.

542
00:45:05,046 --> 00:45:06,544
And the Unsullied?

543
00:45:06,545 --> 00:45:08,170
We can sail with them
to White Harbor,

544
00:45:08,171 --> 00:45:10,878
meet the Dothraki here
on the kingsroad,

545
00:45:10,879 --> 00:45:13,836
then ride together
to Winterfell.

546
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:17,087
Perhaps you should fly
to Winterfell, Your Grace.

547
00:45:17,088 --> 00:45:19,586
You have many enemies
in the North.

548
00:45:19,587 --> 00:45:21,836
Thousands fell
fighting your father.

549
00:45:21,837 --> 00:45:25,544
All it takes is one angry man
with a crossbow.

550
00:45:25,545 --> 00:45:27,753
He'll see your silver hair
on the kingsroad

551
00:45:27,754 --> 00:45:30,795
and know that one well-placed bolt
will make him a hero.

552
00:45:30,796 --> 00:45:33,420
The man who killed
the conqueror.

553

Your Grace.

554
00:45:36,754 --> 00:45:39,961
But if we're going to be
allies in this war,

555
00:45:39,962 --> 00:45:44,045
it's important for the Northerners
to see us as allies.

556
00:45:44,046 --> 00:45:47,212
If we sail
to White Harbor together,

557
00:45:47,213 --> 00:45:49,462
I think it sends
a better message.

558
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:58,669
I've not come
to conquer the North.

559
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:01,004
I'm coming to save
the North.

560
00:46:06,629 --> 00:46:07,962
We sail together.

561
00:46:23,129 --> 00:46:24,129
Jon.

562
00:46:26,296 --> 00:46:27,629
Can I speak
with you?

563
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:32,088
All right.

564
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:40,544
What you did
in King's Landing,

565
00:46:40,545 --> 00:46:42,670
what you said...

566
00:46:44,837 --> 00:46:48,253
you could've
lied to Cersei

567
00:46:48,254 --> 00:46:51,171
about bending the knee
to Daenerys.

568
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:57,629
You risked everything
to tell an enemy the truth.

569
00:46:59,545 --> 00:47:02,003
We went down there
to make peace.

570
00:47:02,004 --> 00:47:05,503
And it seems to me
we need to be honest with each other

571
00:47:05,504 --> 00:47:06,879
if we're going
to fight together.

572
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,879
You've always known
what was right.

573
00:47:14,379 --> 00:47:17,669
Even when we were all
young and stupid,

574
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,170
you always knew.

575
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:21,420
Every step you take...

576
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,753
it's always
the right step.

577
00:47:24,754 --> 00:47:25,878
It's not.

578
00:47:25,879 --> 00:47:28,128
It may seem that way
from the outside,

579
00:47:28,129 --> 00:47:31,545
but I promise you,
it's not true.

580
00:47:33,962 --> 00:47:36,544
I've done plenty of things
that I regret.

581
00:47:36,545 --> 00:47:38,253
Not compared to me,
you haven't.

582
00:47:38,254 --> 00:47:39,879
No.

583
00:47:41,712 --> 00:47:43,504
Not compared to you.

584
00:47:54,754 --> 00:47:57,379
I always wanted
to do the right thing.

585
00:48:00,046 --> 00:48:02,128
Be the right
kind of person.

586
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,712
But I never knew
what that meant.

587
00:48:06,129 --> 00:48:08,462
It always seemed
like there's...

588
00:48:12,545 --> 00:48:14,962
like there was an impossible choice
I had to make.

589
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,213
Stark or Greyjoy.

590
00:48:22,462 --> 00:48:27,087
Our father was more of a father to you
than yours ever was.

591
00:48:27,088 --> 00:48:29,920
- He was.
- And you betrayed him.

592
00:48:29,921 --> 00:48:31,795
Betrayed his memory.

593
00:48:31,796 --> 00:48:32,796
I did.

00:48:37,796 --> 00:48:39,545

lost him.

He's a part of you.

597
00:48:47,046 --> 00:48:48,795
Just like
he's a part of me.

598
00:48:48,796 --> 00:48:50,962
But the things
I've done...

599
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:55,420
It's not my place
to forgive you for all of it.

600
00:48:58,796 --> 00:49:02,003
But what I can
forgive,

601
00:49:02,004 --> 00:49:03,420
I do.

602
00:49:09,796 --> 00:49:11,962
You don't need
to choose.

603
00:49:13,296 --> 00:49:15,254
You're a Greyjoy...

604
00:49:17,462 --> 00:49:18,796
and you're a Stark.

605
00:49:32,504 --> 00:49:35,419
When I was
Ramsay's prisoner,

606
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:39,461
Yara tried
to save me.

cut her throat yet, she's dead.

and watched her fall.

677
00:56:57,004 --> 00:56:58,879
Do you deny it?

678
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:02,419
I did it
to protect you.

679
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,461
You did it to take power
in the Vale.

680
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:07,753
Earlier, you conspired
to murder Jon Arryn.

681
00:57:07,754 --> 00:57:10,253
You gave Lysa Tears of Lys
to poison him.

682
00:57:10,254 --> 00:57:11,296
Do you deny it?

683
00:57:13,629 --> 00:57:16,795
Whatever your aunt
might have told you...

684
00:57:16,796 --> 00:57:19,129
she was
a troubled woman.

685
00:57:20,462 --> 00:57:21,753
She imagined enemies
everywhere.

686
00:57:21,754 --> 00:57:24,128
You had Aunt Lysa send
a letter to our parents

687
00:57:24,129 --> 00:57:26,628
telling them it was the Lannisters
who murdered Jon Arryn

688
00:57:26,629 --> 00:57:28,128
when, really,
it was you.

689
00:57:28,129 --> 00:57:30,337
The conflict between
the Starks and the Lannisters,

690
00:57:30,338 --> 00:57:31,836
it was you
who started it.

691
00:57:31,837 --> 00:57:32,920
Do you deny it?

692
00:57:32,921 --> 00:57:34,544
I know
of no such letter.

693
00:57:34,545 --> 00:57:36,378
You conspired
with Cersei Lannister

694
00:57:36,379 --> 00:57:40,087
and Joffrey Baratheon
to betray our father, Ned Stark.

695
00:57:40,088 --> 00:57:42,628
Thanks to your treachery,
he was imprisoned

696
00:57:42,629 --> 00:57:46,087
and later executed
on false charges of treason.

697
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:48,920
- Do you deny it?
- I deny it!

698
00:57:48,921 --> 00:57:52,295
None of you were there
to see what happened.

699
00:57:52,296 --> 00:57:54,253
None of you
knows the truth.

700
00:57:54,254 --> 00:57:56,171
You held a knife
to his throat.

701
00:58:01,379 --> 00:58:04,004
You said, "I did warn you
not the trust me."

702
00:58:07,338 --> 00:58:12,004
You told our mother
this knife belonged to Tyrion Lannister.

703
00:58:13,338 --> 00:58:15,212
But that was another
one of your lies.

704
00:58:15,213 --> 00:58:17,046
It was yours.

705
00:58:22,171 --> 00:58:25,087
Lady Sansa, I have known you
since you were a girl.

706
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:27,753
- I've protected you.
- Protected me?

707
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,879
By selling me
to the Boltons?

708
00:58:31,213 --> 00:58:33,544
If we could
speak alone,

709
00:58:33,545 --> 00:58:35,088
I can explain
everything.

710
00:58:37,296 --> 00:58:40,419
Sometimes when I'm trying to understand
a person's motives,

711
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:43,003
I play a little game.

712
00:58:43,004 --> 00:58:44,670
I assume the worst.

713
00:58:46,046 --> 00:58:47,961
What's the worst
reason you have

714
00:58:47,962 --> 00:58:49,879
for turning me
against my sister?

715
00:58:51,712 --> 00:58:53,795
That's what you do,
isn't it?

716
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:55,628
That's what
you've always done--

717
00:58:55,629 --> 00:58:57,461
turn family
against family,

718
00:58:57,462 --> 00:58:59,378
turn sister
against sister.

719
00:58:59,379 --> 00:59:01,586
That's what you did
to our mother and Aunt Lysa,

720
00:59:01,587 --> 00:59:03,795
and that's what
you tried to do to us.

721
00:59:03,796 --> 00:59:05,128
Sansa, please.

722
00:59:05,129 --> 00:59:08,961
I'm a slow learner,
it's true.

723
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,419
But I learn.

724
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,669
Give me a chance
to defend myself.

725
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:13,962
I deserve that.

726
00:59:19,796 --> 00:59:21,378
I am Lord Protector
of the Vale

727
00:59:21,379 --> 00:59:23,753
and I command you
to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.

728
00:59:23,754 --> 00:59:25,046
I think not.

729
00:59:28,338 --> 00:59:31,046
Sansa, I beg you!

730
00:59:32,545 --> 00:59:34,586
I loved your mother
since the time I was a boy.

731
00:59:34,587 --> 00:59:36,379
And yet,
you betrayed her.

732
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:41,586
I loved you.

733
00:59:41,587 --> 00:59:43,213
More than anyone.

734
00:59:44,338 --> 00:59:46,129
And yet,
you betrayed me.

735
00:59:48,754 --> 00:59:50,503
When you brought me
back to Winterfell,

736
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:53,045
you told me
there's no justice in the world,

737
00:59:53,046 --> 00:59:55,254
not unless
we make it.

738
00:59:57,254 --> 01:00:01,669
Thank you for all
your many lessons, Lord Baelish.

739
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:03,962
I will never
forget them.

740
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,670
Sansa!

741
01:00:11,004 --> 01:00:12,171
<font color="#D900D9">( gasps )</font>

742
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:16,796
I...

743
01:00:39,879 --> 01:00:41,337
<b><font color="#FF8000">Jaime:</font></b>
Our men in King's Landing

744
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:43,003
will march north
in three days' time.

745
01:00:43,004 --> 01:00:44,378
<b><font color="#804040">Man:</font></b> It'll take us
a fortnight

746
01:00:44,379 --> 01:00:45,711
just to gather supplies
for the train.

747
01:00:45,712 --> 01:00:47,253
<b><font color="#FF8000">Jaime:</font></b> We don't have
a fortnight.

748
01:00:47,254 --> 01:00:49,253
If the North falls, we fall.
Three days.

749
01:00:49,254 --> 01:00:50,795
The remaining forces
in the Westerlands

750
01:00:50,796 --> 01:00:52,503
will take
the river road east.

751
01:00:52,504 --> 01:00:54,045
We'll meet at
Lord Harroway's Town

752
01:00:54,046 --> 01:00:56,045
and march together
to Winterfell.

753
01:00:56,046 --> 01:00:57,213
Ser Jaime.

754
01:00:58,338 --> 01:00:59,711
Your Grace.

755
01:00:59,712 --> 01:01:02,171
My lords, I need a moment
with my brother.

756
01:01:03,796 --> 01:01:05,629
<font color="#804040">Men:</font>
Your Grace.

757
01:01:08,837 --> 01:01:12,669
- What are you doing?
- Preparing the expedition north.

758
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:15,253
Expedition north?

759
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:18,544
I always knew you were
the stupidest Lannister.

760
01:01:18,545 --> 01:01:21,212
The Starks and Targaryens
have united against us,

761
01:01:21,213 --> 01:01:23,337
and you want to fight
alongside them?

762
01:01:23,338 --> 01:01:25,295
Are you a traitor
or an idiot?

763
01:01:25,296 --> 01:01:27,253
You pledged our forces
to fight our common enemy--

764
01:01:27,254 --> 01:01:28,711
I'll say whatever
I need to say

765
01:01:28,712 --> 01:01:30,419
to ensure the survival
of our house.

766
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,170
You expect me to trust the man
who murdered our father?

767
01:01:33,171 --> 01:01:36,753
You expect me to command our troops
to fight beside foreign scum,

768
01:01:36,754 --> 01:01:38,253
to fight for
the Dragon Queen?

769
01:01:38,254 --> 01:01:40,170
You saw it
with your own eyes.

770
01:01:40,171 --> 01:01:42,544
You saw a dead man
trying to kill us.

771
01:01:42,545 --> 01:01:44,378
I saw it burn.

772
01:01:44,379 --> 01:01:46,212
If dragons
can't stop them,

773
01:01:46,213 --> 01:01:49,253
if Dothraki and Unsullied
and Northmen can't stop them,

774
01:01:49,254 --> 01:01:51,253
how will our armies
make a difference?

775
01:01:51,254 --> 01:01:53,253
This isn't about
noble houses,

776
01:01:53,254 --> 01:01:55,378
this is about
the living and the dead!

777
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:57,419
And I intend to stay
amongst the living.

778
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:00,628
Let the Stark boy and his new queen
defend the North.

779
01:02:00,629 --> 01:02:02,836
We stay here
where we've always been.

780
01:02:02,837 --> 01:02:05,379
I made a promise.

781
01:02:07,545 --> 01:02:10,961
Our child
will rule Westeros.

782
01:02:10,962 --> 01:02:15,836
Our child will never be born
if the dead come south.

783
01:02:15,837 --> 01:02:17,419
The monsters are real.

784
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:19,544
The white walkers,

785
01:02:19,545 --> 01:02:21,795
the dragons,
the Dothraki screamers--

786
01:02:21,796 --> 01:02:25,795
all the frightening stories we heard
when we were young, they're all real.

787
01:02:25,796 --> 01:02:27,503
So be it.

788
01:02:27,504 --> 01:02:29,628
Let the monsters
kill each other.

789
01:02:29,629 --> 01:02:31,878
And while they battle
in the North,

790
01:02:31,879 --> 01:02:34,295
we take back the lands
that belong to us.

791
01:02:34,296 --> 01:02:37,087
- And then what?
- And then we rule.

792
01:02:37,088 --> 01:02:40,003
When the fighting
in the North is over, someone wins.

793
01:02:40,004 --> 01:02:42,170
You understand that,
don't you?

794
01:02:42,171 --> 01:02:45,669
If the dead win,
they march south and kill us all.

795
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:48,753
If the living win,
and we've betrayed them,

796
01:02:48,754 --> 01:02:50,711
they march south
and kill us all!

797
01:02:50,712 --> 01:02:53,711
The Targaryens and the Starks
already want to kill us all.

798
01:02:53,712 --> 01:02:55,128
Most of them
will die in the North.

799
01:02:55,129 --> 01:02:56,711
I faced them
in the field.

800
01:02:56,712 --> 01:02:59,253
We can't beat them.
We can't beat their dragons.

801
01:02:59,254 --> 01:03:00,795
How many dragons
did you see at the pit?

802
01:03:00,796 --> 01:03:02,795
- Two.
- What happened to the third?

803
01:03:02,796 --> 01:03:05,295
For all we know,
it's guarding her fleet!

804
01:03:05,296 --> 01:03:08,628
She came here with her dragons and her
Dothraki and her Unsullied.

805
01:03:08,629 --> 01:03:11,419
She came here to show us
all her power.

806
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:14,461
No, something happened.
The dragons are vulnerable.

807
01:03:14,462 --> 01:03:17,003
We can't beat the Dothraki.
We don't have the numbers.

808
01:03:17,004 --> 01:03:18,836
We don't have the support
of the other houses!

809
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:21,504
No, we have something better.
We have the Iron Bank.

810
01:03:23,504 --> 01:03:27,461
You should've listened more when Father
spoke about the importance of gold.

811
01:03:27,462 --> 01:03:29,628
Oh, I know
it's boring for you.

812
01:03:29,629 --> 01:03:33,253
You just wanted to hunt
and ride and fight.

813
01:03:33,254 --> 01:03:35,836
But I listened,
I learned.

814
01:03:35,837 --> 01:03:39,836
Highgarden bought us
the most powerful army in Essos--

815
01:03:39,837 --> 01:03:41,628
the Golden Company.

816
01:03:41,629 --> 01:03:45,337
20,000 men, horses,
elephants, I believe.

817
01:03:45,338 --> 01:03:47,003
The Golden Company
is not here.

818
01:03:47,004 --> 01:03:48,378
They're in Essos.

819
01:03:48,379 --> 01:03:52,337
How is a mercenary company
in Essos going to help us?

820
01:03:52,338 --> 01:03:54,836
Do you really think
Euron Greyjoy turned tail

821
01:03:54,837 --> 01:03:56,462
and sailed back
to the Iron Islands?

822
01:03:57,587 --> 01:03:58,961
Do you think
he abandoned

823
01:03:58,962 --> 01:04:02,212
the chance to marry
the queen?

824
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,545
No one walks away
from me.

825
01:04:06,379 --> 01:04:08,045
He's sailing with
his fleet to Essos.

826
01:04:08,046 --> 01:04:10,128
He's going to ferry
the Golden Company back here

827
01:04:10,129 --> 01:04:11,670
to help us win
the war for Westeros.

828
01:04:14,213 --> 01:04:17,378
You plotted with Euron Greyjoy
without telling me,

829
01:04:17,379 --> 01:04:19,212
the commander
of your armies?

830
01:04:19,213 --> 01:04:21,836
And you conspired
with Tyrion,

831
01:04:21,837 --> 01:04:23,212
the man who murdered
our father,

832
01:04:23,213 --> 01:04:24,544
without telling me,
your queen.

833
01:04:24,545 --> 01:04:26,003
I didn't conspire
with him.

834
01:04:26,004 --> 01:04:27,878
You met with him in secret
without my consent.

835
01:04:27,879 --> 01:04:29,878
You planned to promote
my enemies' interests.

836
01:04:29,879 --> 01:04:32,170
That  is the definition
of conspiracy.

837
01:04:32,171 --> 01:04:34,544
I pledged
to ride north.

838
01:04:34,545 --> 01:04:36,378
I intend to honor
that pledge.

839
01:04:36,379 --> 01:04:38,586
- And that will be treason.
- Treason?

840
01:04:38,587 --> 01:04:40,836
Disobeying your queen's command,
fighting with her enemies.

841
01:04:40,837 --> 01:04:42,171
What would you
call it?

842
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:46,046
Doesn't matter
what I'd call it.

843
01:04:53,004 --> 01:04:55,754
I told you no one
walks away from me.

844
01:04:58,088 --> 01:05:00,629
Are you going to
order him to kill me?

845
01:05:02,754 --> 01:05:04,711
I'm the only one

846
01:05:04,712 --> 01:05:07,170
Our children are gone,
our father is gone.

847
01:05:07,171 --> 01:05:08,920
It's just
me and you now.

848
01:05:08,921 --> 01:05:10,921
There's one more
yet to come.

849
01:05:13,921 --> 01:05:15,921

858

- You're a good man.
- Oh, well, thank you,

859
01:07:49,796 --> 01:07:52,420
but, um, I'm not sure
that I am.

860
01:07:56,587 --> 01:07:58,754
What happened to you
beyond the Wall?

861
01:08:00,171 --> 01:08:01,754
I became
the Three-Eyed Raven.

862
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,462
Oh!

863
01:08:07,754 --> 01:08:10,128
I don't know
what that means.

864
01:08:10,129 --> 01:08:12,878
I can see things
that happened in the past.

865
01:08:12,879 --> 01:08:16,961
I can see things
happening now

866
01:08:16,962 --> 01:08:18,462
all over the world.

867
01:08:19,879 --> 01:08:22,296
Why did you come
to Winterfell?

868
01:08:23,587 --> 01:08:24,962
Um...

869
01:08:27,171 --> 01:08:29,337
Jon's the one to lead
the fight against the dead.

870
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:31,419
I know he is.

871
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,378
But he can't
do it alone,

872
01:08:33,379 --> 01:08:36,253
so I've come here
to help him.

873
01:08:36,254 --> 01:08:39,128
He's on his way
back to Winterfell

874
01:08:39,129 --> 01:08:40,754
with Daenerys Targaryen.

875
01:08:41,921 --> 01:08:44,961
You--
you saw this in--

876
01:08:44,962 --> 01:08:46,629
in a vision?

877
01:08:49,629 --> 01:08:50,837
Oh.

878
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,837
He needs to know
the truth.

879
01:08:57,088 --> 01:08:58,378
The truth
about what?

880
01:08:58,379 --> 01:09:00,170
About himself.

881
01:09:00,171 --> 01:09:03,711
No one knows.
No one but me.

882
01:09:03,712 --> 01:09:06,669
Jon isn't really
my father's son.

883
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:10,836
He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen
and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.

884
01:09:10,837 --> 01:09:14,669
He was born
in a tower in Dorne.

885
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:17,128
His last name
isn't really Snow,

886
01:09:17,129 --> 01:09:18,129
it's Sand.

887
01:09:20,504 --> 01:09:21,504
It's not.

888
01:09:23,088 --> 01:09:25,503
Dornish bastards
are named Sand.

889
01:09:25,504 --> 01:09:29,128
At the Citadel, I transcribed
a High Septon's diary.

890
01:09:29,129 --> 01:09:31,879
He annulled Rhaegar's
marriage to Elia.

891
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:36,587
He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna
in a secret ceremony.

892
01:09:37,879 --> 01:09:39,337
Are you certain?

893
01:09:39,338 --> 01:09:42,045
It's what the High Septon
wrote in his private diary.

894
01:09:42,046 --> 01:09:43,879
I don't know
why he'd lie.

895
01:09:45,712 --> 01:09:48,254
Is this something
