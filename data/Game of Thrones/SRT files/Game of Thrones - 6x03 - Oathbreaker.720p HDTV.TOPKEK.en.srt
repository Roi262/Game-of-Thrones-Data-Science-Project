2
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,541
Easy, easy.

3
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,176
Easy.

4
00:05:18,222 --> 00:05:19,689
What do you remember?

5
00:05:26,698 --> 00:05:28,865
They stabbed me.

6
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:35,171
Olly...

7
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:39,408
he put a knife in my heart.

8
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:47,616
I shouldn't be here.

9
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:51,921
The lady brought you back.

10
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:55,758
Afterwards, after they stabbed you,

11
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,027
after you died, where did you go?

12
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:00,063
What did you see?

13
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:06,302
Nothing.

14
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,074
There was nothing at all.

15
00:06:15,346 --> 00:06:18,147
The Lord let you come back for a reason.

16
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:22,752
Stannis was not the
prince who was promised,

17
00:06:22,854 --> 00:06:24,453
but someone has to be.

18
00:06:29,027 --> 00:06:31,160
Could you give us a moment?

19
00:06:51,716 --> 00:06:54,283
You were dead.

20
00:06:54,385 --> 00:06:56,085
And now you're not.

21
00:06:57,555 --> 00:07:01,423
That's completely fucking
mad, seems to me.

22
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:03,960
I can only imagine how it seems to you.

23
00:07:06,297 --> 00:07:08,631
I did what I thought was right.

24
00:07:11,035 --> 00:07:12,769
And I got murdered for it.

25
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:16,105
And now I'm back.

26
00:07:16,207 --> 00:07:17,606
Why?

27
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,308
I don't know.

28
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,811
Maybe we'll never know.

29
00:07:21,913 --> 00:07:23,880
What does it matter?

30
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:27,650
You go on.

31
00:07:29,453 --> 00:07:31,954
You fight for as long as you can.

32
00:07:32,056 --> 00:07:34,957
You clean up as much of
the shit as you can.

33
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:37,994
I don't know how to do that.

34
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:41,730
I thought I did, but...

35
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,536
I failed.

36
00:07:50,308 --> 00:07:52,574
Good.

37
00:07:52,677 --> 00:07:54,177
Now go fail again.

38
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:52,935
They think you're some kind of god.

39
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:55,838
The man who returned from the dead.

40
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,506
I'm not a god.

41
00:08:58,349 --> 00:09:00,309
I know that.

42
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,812
I saw your pecker.

43
00:09:03,915 --> 00:09:06,815
What kind of god would
have a pecker that small?

44
00:09:32,576 --> 00:09:35,144
Your eyes are still brown.

45
00:09:35,246 --> 00:09:37,013
Is that still you in there?

46
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:39,015
I think so.

47
00:09:41,552 --> 00:09:44,253
Hold off on burning my body for now.

48
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,757
That's funny.

49
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:52,628
You sure that's still you in there?

50
00:10:24,128 --> 00:10:26,062
You all right?

51
00:10:26,164 --> 00:10:28,797
Yes. Yes, I'm fine.

52
00:10:31,836 --> 00:10:35,571
Did I ever tell you I used to
think the sea was called the see

53
00:10:35,673 --> 00:10:38,607
because it was nothing but water
as far as the eye could see?

54
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:40,009
I don't think so.

55
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:42,511
Sea, see.

56
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:45,414
They're spelled different,
but they sound the same.

57
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:48,517
Yeah, they do.

58
00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:51,587
It was before I learned
how to read, obviously.

59
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:57,860
Sam, are you going to be sick?

60
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,344
Won't be long. We'll
be in the south soon.

61
00:11:15,446 --> 00:11:17,480
I'm excited to see Oldtown.

62
00:11:17,581 --> 00:11:23,085
Captain says it's the most
beautiful city in Westeros.

63
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:26,588
Are you going to vomit again?

64
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,891
No. No, no, no. I'm...

65
00:11:31,095 --> 00:11:33,195
The Citadel doesn't admit women.

66
00:11:33,297 --> 00:11:36,365
There won't be a place for
you there or for Little Sam.

67
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:39,902
I stayed at Castle Black.
There's no women allowed there.

68
00:11:40,004 --> 00:11:42,071
The Citadel isn't Castle Black.

69
00:11:42,173 --> 00:11:47,150
I don't have a Jon Snow or Maester
Aemon to help me bend the rules.

70
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:50,413
I'll stay in Oldtown, then.

71
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:52,181
By yourself?

72
00:11:52,283 --> 00:11:53,982
With a baby and no money?

73
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:57,353
So if we're not going to Oldtown,

74
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:58,620
where are you taking me?

75
00:12:00,024 --> 00:12:02,358
To my home.

76
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,725
Horn Hill.

77
00:12:05,896 --> 00:12:08,297
My father's... well, my father,

78
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,967
but my mother's a kind woman
and my sister's lovely.

79
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,770
They'll take care of you both.

80
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,140
"Wherever you go, I go, too."

81
00:12:18,242 --> 00:12:19,975
That's what you said.

82
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,628
I said that because I want you
and Little Sam to be safe.

83
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,997
That's all I want...

84
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,634
to become a maester so I can
help Jon when the time comes

85
00:12:45,736 --> 00:12:47,369
so you'll be safe.

86
00:12:47,472 --> 00:12:49,071
Us and everyone else in the world.

87
00:12:49,173 --> 00:12:51,307
I don't care about them.

88
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:55,311
Well, no, I do, but I don't really.

89
00:12:56,514 --> 00:12:58,814
I care about you and him.

90
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:03,285
I know that, Sam.

91
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:05,621
And he does, too.

92
00:13:08,826 --> 00:13:10,892
You're the only one who ever has.

93
00:13:19,504 --> 00:13:22,104
If you think it's for the best,

94
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:24,840
we trust you.

95
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:27,843
I'd feel better if you threw
something at me and stormed off.

96
00:13:27,945 --> 00:13:31,413
I'd never do that to
the father of my son.

97
00:14:29,006 --> 00:14:31,507
That's my father.

98
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:34,009
The man beside him is Howland Reed,

99
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:35,644
Meera's father.

100
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:49,191
Ser Arthur Dayne.

101
00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:51,427
The Sword of the Morning.

102
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:54,296
Father said he was the best
swordsman he ever saw.

103
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,446
Lord Stark.

104
00:15:10,548 --> 00:15:13,749
I looked for you on the Trident.

105
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:15,817
We weren't there.

106
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,486
Your friend the usurper

107
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:20,556
would lie beneath the
ground if we had been.

108
00:15:20,658 --> 00:15:22,691
The Mad King is dead.

109
00:15:22,793 --> 00:15:24,860
Rhaegar lies beneath the ground.

110
00:15:24,962 --> 00:15:27,363
Why weren't you there
to protect your prince?

111
00:15:27,465 --> 00:15:29,365
Our prince wanted us here.

112
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,774
Where's my sister?

113
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:44,045
I wish you good fortune
in the wars to come.

114
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:53,522
And now it begins.

115
00:15:58,061 --> 00:16:00,128
No.

116
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,164
Now it ends.

117
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:41,363
He's better than my father.

118
00:17:41,465 --> 00:17:42,998
Far better.

119
00:17:48,105 --> 00:17:50,071
But Father beat him.

120
00:17:50,173 --> 00:17:52,240
Did he?

121
00:17:52,342 --> 00:17:54,309
I know he did.

122
00:17:54,412 --> 00:17:56,077
Heard the story a thousand times.

123
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:15,997
He stabbed him in the back.

124
00:18:35,021 --> 00:18:36,752
What's in the tower?

125
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:38,554
That's enough for one day.

126
00:18:38,656 --> 00:18:40,355
We'll visit again another time.

127
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,024
- I want to see where he's going.
- Time to go.

128
00:18:44,595 --> 00:18:45,794
Father!

129
00:19:12,222 --> 00:19:13,889
Why did you do that?

130
00:19:13,991 --> 00:19:16,057
Take me back there. I want to go back.

131
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:17,425
No.

132
00:19:19,663 --> 00:19:22,030
- He heard me.
- Maybe.

133
00:19:22,132 --> 00:19:25,433
- Maybe he heard the wind.
- He heard me.

134
00:19:25,536 --> 00:19:28,537
The past is already written.
The ink is dry.

135
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,939
What's in that tower?

136
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,374
I want to go back there.

137
00:19:32,476 --> 00:19:35,243
I've told you many times, stay too long

138
00:19:35,345 --> 00:19:37,779
where you don't belong and
you will never return.

139
00:19:37,882 --> 00:19:39,681
Why do I want to return?

140
00:19:39,783 --> 00:19:41,550
So I can be a cripple again?

141
00:19:41,652 --> 00:19:44,085
So I can talk to an old man in a tree?

142
00:19:44,187 --> 00:19:46,221
You think I wanted to sit
here for 1,000 years

143
00:19:46,323 --> 00:19:48,189
watching the world from a distance

144
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,691
as the roots grew through me?

145
00:19:49,793 --> 00:19:51,459
So why did you?

146
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,362
I was waiting for you.

147
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:56,231
I don't want to be you.

148
00:19:56,887 --> 00:19:58,967
I don't blame you.

149
00:20:00,303 --> 00:20:02,538
You won't be here forever.

150
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,240
You won't be an old man in a tree.

151
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:07,776
But before you leave,

152
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:10,846
you must learn.

153
00:20:10,948 --> 00:20:12,781
Learn what?

154
00:20:12,883 --> 00:20:15,483
Everything.

155
00:20:36,272 --> 00:20:39,650

156
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:17,445

00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:54,564
_

191
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:57,375
_

192
00:24:08,986 --> 00:24:11,987
I don't know how you stand
it in all that leather.

193
00:24:19,163 --> 00:24:21,062
If we could have the room.

194
00:24:31,508 --> 00:24:34,209
You look lovely today, my dear.
You really do.

195
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:38,680
How you climbed all those steps
without breaking a sweat.

196
00:24:38,782 --> 00:24:39,948
If you're going to torture me,

197
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,150
just call them back and get on with it.

198
00:24:42,252 --> 00:24:44,319
I am not a torturer.

199
00:24:45,755 --> 00:24:49,191
Though it so often is
what people deserve.

200
00:24:50,393 --> 00:24:53,128
And it does provide answers.

201
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,097
But they're usually the wrong answers.

202
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,701
My job is to find the right answers.

203
00:24:59,803 --> 00:25:01,903
Do you know how I do that?

204
00:25:02,005 --> 00:25:05,273
I do it by making people happy.

205
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:08,009
I'd like to make you happy, Vala.

206
00:25:08,111 --> 00:25:11,313
That's your name, isn't it, Vala?

207
00:25:11,414 --> 00:25:13,715
That's all right.

208
00:25:13,817 --> 00:25:16,952
I know who you are and what you've done.

209
00:25:18,822 --> 00:25:20,121
You've done a lot.

210
00:25:20,224 --> 00:25:22,690
You've sacrificed your body for a cause,

211
00:25:22,792 --> 00:25:26,127
which is more than most people do.

212
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:29,331
And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy

213
00:25:29,432 --> 00:25:32,200
murder the Unsullied
and the Second Sons.

214
00:25:32,302 --> 00:25:35,636
The Unsullied and the Second
Sons are foreign soldiers

215
00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:37,772
brought here by a foreign queen

216
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:40,575
to destroy our city and our history.

217
00:25:40,677 --> 00:25:43,511
I understand.

218
00:25:43,613 --> 00:25:46,281
Well, that makes perfect sense

219
00:25:46,383 --> 00:25:49,117
from your perspective.

220
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:52,988
I have a different
perspective, of course.

221
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,557
I think it's important that you try
to see things from my perspective

222
00:25:56,659 --> 00:25:59,027
just as I will try to
see them from yours.

223
00:25:59,129 --> 00:26:01,329
Because that is the only way

224
00:26:01,431 --> 00:26:04,332
that I can make you and Dom happy.

225
00:26:07,437 --> 00:26:11,239
That is how you pronounce it... Dom?

226
00:26:11,341 --> 00:26:14,342
I'm afraid I don't really
speak the language.

227
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:17,779
Such a handsome boy.

228
00:26:17,881 --> 00:26:21,416
Those big, brown eyes. Good
luck keeping the ladies away.

229
00:26:21,518 --> 00:26:25,653
Yes, you're a true
liberator, aren't you?

230
00:26:25,755 --> 00:26:28,623
You won't torture me, you'll
just threaten my son.

231
00:26:28,725 --> 00:26:31,159
Children are blameless.

232
00:26:32,195 --> 00:26:34,396
I have never hurt them.

233
00:26:34,497 --> 00:26:36,831
Your boy is in no immediate danger,

234
00:26:36,934 --> 00:26:38,499
this I swear to you.

235
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,370
But between us, dear,

236
00:26:42,472 --> 00:26:45,606
you did conspire to kill
the queen's soldiers.

237
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:48,276
We both know the penalty for that crime.

238
00:26:53,383 --> 00:26:57,052
How will poor Dom get
on without his mother?

239
00:26:57,154 --> 00:26:59,187
And with his breathing problem.

240
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:01,622
If I tell you anything, they'll kill me.

241
00:27:01,724 --> 00:27:03,891
So either you kill me or they do.

242
00:27:03,994 --> 00:27:07,528
Yes, from your perspective,
this is a problem.

243
00:27:09,066 --> 00:27:11,099
There is a third option, though.

244
00:27:11,201 --> 00:27:14,402
A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.

245
00:27:14,504 --> 00:27:19,140
I've already booked passage for
a woman and her young son.

246
00:27:19,242 --> 00:27:22,677
I'll even throw in a bag of
silver to help you start again.

247
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:24,545
Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask

248
00:27:24,647 --> 00:27:28,350
one of our leather-clad
friends back in to carry it.

249
00:27:28,452 --> 00:27:30,151
Far too heavy for me.

250
00:27:31,521 --> 00:27:33,388
The boat sails at dawn.

251
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,257
You need to decide now.

252
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,127
A new life for you and Dom

253
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:40,862
or...

254
00:27:56,913 --> 00:27:58,713
What should we do while we wait?

255
00:27:58,815 --> 00:28:00,615
To pass the time, what should we do?

256
00:28:00,717 --> 00:28:03,051
What should we talk about?

257
00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:07,155
You speak 19 languages.

258
00:28:07,257 --> 00:28:10,591
You must occasionally use some
of them to talk about things.

259
00:28:10,693 --> 00:28:13,928
You two, you spend a great
deal of time together.

260
00:28:14,031 --> 00:28:17,198
What would you be talking
about if I weren't here?

261
00:28:18,268 --> 00:28:20,235
Patrol.

262
00:28:20,337 --> 00:28:22,970
When I am going on patrol
with the Unsullied.

263
00:28:23,073 --> 00:28:25,640
What we see on patrol.

264
00:28:25,742 --> 00:28:27,675
Who we captured on patrol.

265
00:28:27,777 --> 00:28:30,245
That's good. That's very good.

266
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:34,749
But that's a report.

267
00:28:34,851 --> 00:28:37,052
I was thinking more of a conversation.

268
00:28:37,154 --> 00:28:40,188
A wise man once said the
true history of the world

269
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,691
is the history of great
conversations in elegant rooms.

270
00:28:43,793 --> 00:28:45,693
Who said this?

271
00:28:45,795 --> 00:28:48,163
Me.

272
00:28:48,265 --> 00:28:50,231
Just now.

273
00:28:56,573 --> 00:28:58,806
All right, no conversations.

274
00:28:58,908 --> 00:29:00,775
Let's play a game.

275
00:29:03,646 --> 00:29:05,413
You don't play games,
either one of you, ever?

276
00:29:05,515 --> 00:29:06,747
Games are for children.

277
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:10,852
My master Kraznys would
sometimes make us play games.

278
00:29:10,853 --> 00:29:12,587
There, that's a start.

279
00:29:12,689 --> 00:29:16,357
- Only the girls.
- No, no, no.

280
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,426
Not that. Of course not that.

281
00:29:19,796 --> 00:29:22,029
Innocent games. Fun games.

282
00:29:22,132 --> 00:29:23,631
Drinking games.

283
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:25,933
We do not drink.

284
00:29:26,035 --> 00:29:28,035
Until you do.

285
00:29:29,772 --> 00:29:31,906
All right. No drinking.

286
00:29:32,008 --> 00:29:33,541
We can play without drinking.

287
00:29:33,643 --> 00:29:35,810
It's a wonderful game. I invented it.

288
00:29:35,912 --> 00:29:37,412
Here's how it works.

289
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:39,481
I make a statement about your past.

290
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:41,216
If I'm wrong, I drink.

291
00:29:41,318 --> 00:29:44,419
And if I'm right...

292
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:47,922
maybe we can't play without drinking.

293
00:29:49,692 --> 00:29:52,160
Oh, you took your time.

294
00:29:52,262 --> 00:29:54,229
Sorry.

295
00:29:54,331 --> 00:29:57,965
I was busy learning who funds
the Sons of the Harpy.

296
00:29:58,067 --> 00:30:00,101
- Some things you can't rush.
- You found out?

297
00:30:00,203 --> 00:30:02,337
The Good Masters of Astapor

298
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:04,606
and the Wise Masters of Yunkai.

299
00:30:04,707 --> 00:30:07,708
With help from their
friends in Volantis.

300
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,244
You see?

301
00:30:09,346 --> 00:30:11,846
You don't even have to worry
about the local rebellion.

302
00:30:11,948 --> 00:30:13,481
We only have to worry about

303
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:15,783
the three rich foreign
cities paying for it.

304
00:30:15,885 --> 00:30:17,519
We conquered Astapor and Yunkai once.

305
00:30:17,621 --> 00:30:19,454
We will do it again and
execute the Masters.

306
00:30:19,556 --> 00:30:22,957
If the Unsullied march off to
reconquer Astapor and Yunkai,

307
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:24,559
who will remain to defend
the free people of Meereen?

308
00:30:24,661 --> 00:30:27,195
If we do not fight them,
how can we stop them?

309
00:30:27,297 --> 00:30:28,996
We cannot.

310
00:30:29,098 --> 00:30:31,866
The Masters speak only one language.

311
00:30:31,968 --> 00:30:33,635
They spoke it to me for many years.

312
00:30:33,736 --> 00:30:35,503
I know it better than my mother tongue.

313
00:30:35,605 --> 00:30:39,274
If we want them to hear us, we
must speak it back to them.

314
00:30:39,376 --> 00:30:41,543
May it be the last thing they ever hear.

315
00:30:41,645 --> 00:30:43,711
You may be right.

316
00:30:43,813 --> 00:30:45,780
So we will fight them?

317
00:30:45,882 --> 00:30:47,815
- Possibly.
- Possibly?

318
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:50,818
It's a conversation.

319
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,221
Tell me, can your little
birds get a message

320
00:30:53,323 --> 00:30:56,558
to the Good Masters of Astapor,
the Wise Masters of Yunkai,

321
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,227
and benevolent enslavers of Volantis?

322
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:01,962
Of course. Men can be fickle,

323
00:31:02,065 --> 00:31:05,200
but birds I always trust.

324
00:31:05,201 --> 00:31:11,507
exclusive from -tusubt-itulo=-.co/m

325
00:31:11,508 --> 00:31:14,409
Your eye looks much better, Arthur.

326
00:31:14,511 --> 00:31:15,843
How's your mother's jaw?

327
00:31:15,945 --> 00:31:17,478
Better.

328
00:31:17,581 --> 00:31:18,913
And your father?

329
00:31:19,015 --> 00:31:21,482
No one's seen him.

330
00:31:21,585 --> 00:31:22,850
And no one will.

331
00:31:22,952 --> 00:31:24,586
That worked out rather nicely.

332
00:31:24,688 --> 00:31:26,721
Will Lord Varys ever come back?

333
00:31:26,823 --> 00:31:28,889
I don't think so.

334
00:31:28,991 --> 00:31:30,791
Do you miss him?

335
00:31:30,893 --> 00:31:33,461
He was nice.

336
00:31:33,563 --> 00:31:35,863
He called us his little birds.

337
00:31:35,965 --> 00:31:37,565
He gave us sweets.

338
00:31:39,802 --> 00:31:42,503
It's funny you should mention that.

339
00:31:44,274 --> 00:31:48,209
Guess what I happened to find today.

340
00:31:48,311 --> 00:31:51,912
Candied plums from Dorne.

341
00:31:55,452 --> 00:31:57,585
Now remember, if any of your friends

342
00:31:57,687 --> 00:32:00,921
like sweets or need help,
they can always come to me.

343
00:32:01,023 --> 00:32:05,426
All I need in return are whispers.

344
00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:14,669
No need to be afraid.

345
00:32:14,771 --> 00:32:16,671
This is Ser Gregor.

346
00:32:16,773 --> 00:32:19,006
He's friends with all my friends.

347
00:32:24,847 --> 00:32:26,547
Run along now.

348
00:32:31,521 --> 00:32:33,220
Varys's little birds?

349
00:32:33,323 --> 00:32:34,822
Your little birds now, Your Grace.

350
00:32:34,924 --> 00:32:36,857
What did you do to him exactly?

351
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:38,626
I haven't been able to
get a clear answer.

352
00:32:38,728 --> 00:32:40,762
Oh, a number of things.

353
00:32:40,863 --> 00:32:42,363
Does he understand what we're saying?

354
00:32:42,465 --> 00:32:44,699
I mean, to the extent
that he ever understood

355
00:32:44,801 --> 00:32:47,034
complete sentences in the first place.

356
00:32:48,805 --> 00:32:50,905
He understands well enough.

357
00:32:51,007 --> 00:32:53,040
So tell him to march into the sept

358
00:32:53,142 --> 00:32:55,743
and crush the High Sparrow's
head like a melon.

359
00:32:55,845 --> 00:32:59,246
The High Sparrow has hundreds of
Faith Militant surrounding him.

360
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:01,616
Ser Gregor can't face them all.

361
00:33:01,718 --> 00:33:03,651
And he won't have to.

362
00:33:03,753 --> 00:33:05,753
He'll only have to face one.

363
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:10,291
Has the Faith leveled
official charges yet?

364
00:33:10,393 --> 00:33:12,059
Not yet.

365
00:33:12,161 --> 00:33:15,330
That is one trial by combat
I look forward to watching.

366
00:33:15,432 --> 00:33:17,332
Don't stop at the city.

367
00:33:17,434 --> 00:33:19,734
I want little birds in Dorne,

368
00:33:19,836 --> 00:33:22,503
in Highgarden, in the North.

369
00:33:22,605 --> 00:33:25,673
If someone is planning on
making our losses their gains,

370
00:33:25,775 --> 00:33:27,608
I want to hear it.

371
00:33:27,711 --> 00:33:30,311
If someone is laughing at the queen

372
00:33:30,413 --> 00:33:33,047
who walked naked through the
streets covered in shit,

373
00:33:33,149 --> 00:33:34,915
I want to hear.

374
00:33:35,017 --> 00:33:37,785
I want to know who they are.

375
00:33:37,887 --> 00:33:40,020
I want to know where they are.

376
00:33:46,262 --> 00:33:49,230
- As bad as Lord Varys was,
- Qyburn is worse.

377
00:33:49,332 --> 00:33:51,733
I told them all. I told them.

378
00:33:51,835 --> 00:33:53,735
He's arrogant, dangerous.

379
00:33:53,837 --> 00:33:56,871
You don't get thrown out of the
Citadel without good reason.

380
00:33:56,973 --> 00:33:58,706
And no one listened to my advice.

381
00:33:58,808 --> 00:34:00,908
So here we are.

382
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:05,447
And what he's done to Gregor
Clegane is an abomination.

383
00:34:05,448 --> 00:34:08,549
We never sanctioned this experiment.

384
00:34:08,651 --> 00:34:11,218
I for one think it will
be in our best interest

385
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,987
to have the beast dest...

386
00:34:17,861 --> 00:34:20,395
- Can I help you?
- Why are you here?

387
00:34:20,497 --> 00:34:22,864
- My mother...
- I was invited, my dear,

388
00:34:22,965 --> 00:34:25,633
to help deal with several
troublesome issues,

389
00:34:25,735 --> 00:34:28,035
such as the queen's imprisonment.

390
00:34:28,137 --> 00:34:30,571
Thank you for bringing it up.

391
00:34:30,673 --> 00:34:34,375
It's well past time we addressed
the abuses I endured.

392
00:34:34,477 --> 00:34:36,677
Margaery is the queen.

393
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,546
You are not the queen

394
00:34:38,648 --> 00:34:40,681
because you're not married to the king.

395
00:34:40,784 --> 00:34:42,483
I do appreciate these things

396
00:34:42,585 --> 00:34:46,186
can get a bit confusing in your family.

397
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:48,456
This is a small council meeting.

398
00:34:48,558 --> 00:34:50,691
You have no position
on the small council.

399
00:34:50,794 --> 00:34:52,560
I'm the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

400
00:34:52,662 --> 00:34:54,094
The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard

401
00:34:54,196 --> 00:34:55,930
does have a position
on the small council.

402
00:34:56,032 --> 00:34:58,566
Grand Maester Pycelle, would
you sanction that statement?

403
00:34:58,668 --> 00:35:00,768
Well...

404
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:03,838
I would say Ser Gerold Hightower

405
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,006
had a seat on the Mad King's council.

406
00:35:06,108 --> 00:35:08,676
Of course, that was the Mad King.

407
00:35:08,778 --> 00:35:10,377
King Robert saw things differently.

408
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,179
And King...

409
00:35:15,485 --> 00:35:18,319
What about Myrcella's death, Uncle?

410
00:35:18,421 --> 00:35:20,588
Do you consider the
murder of your own blood

411
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,690
a troublesome issue?

412
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:24,625
The same women who murdered Myrcella

413
00:35:24,727 --> 00:35:27,194
have overthrown House Martell
and taken control of Dorne.

414
00:35:27,296 --> 00:35:28,996
We've got a lot to discuss.

415
00:35:29,098 --> 00:35:31,499
All of us together.

416
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:35,302
And seeing as you cannot make us
leave, we best get on with it.

417
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,974
No, we cannot make you leave.

418
00:35:40,076 --> 00:35:43,177
And you cannot make us stay.

419
00:35:43,279 --> 00:35:46,881
Not unless you're gonna have
that thing murder us all.

420
00:35:57,988 --> 00:36:28,255
VISIT US : TU-SUBT-TITULO-.C.O/M.

421
00:36:28,257 --> 00:36:30,090
Your Grace.

422
00:36:30,192 --> 00:36:33,360
My mother would like to see her
daughter's final resting place.

423
00:36:33,462 --> 00:36:36,030
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

424
00:36:36,132 --> 00:36:37,999
That's not possible. Not yet.

425
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,767
When will it be possible?

426
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:42,169
When she's fully atoned for her sins.

427
00:36:42,238 --> 00:36:44,839
You cut off her hair
and marched her naked

428
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:47,374
through the streets in
front of the whole city.

429
00:36:47,476 --> 00:36:49,143
That wasn't the full atonement?!

430
00:36:49,245 --> 00:36:51,012
No.

431
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,248
She must stand trial
before seven septons

432
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,483
so we can learn the true
extent of her sins.

433
00:36:56,586 --> 00:37:00,755
I want you to let her see
Myrcella's resting place.

434
00:37:00,857 --> 00:37:02,423
I am the king.

435
00:37:02,525 --> 00:37:03,991
You are.

436
00:37:06,029 --> 00:37:07,895
And what does that mean to you?

437
00:37:07,997 --> 00:37:09,363
It means a great deal to me.

438
00:37:09,465 --> 00:37:11,365
The Crown and the Faith

439
00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:13,601
are the twin pillars of the world.

440
00:37:13,703 --> 00:37:15,736
Do you know who told me that?

441
00:37:17,106 --> 00:37:18,439
Your mother.

442
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:21,042
My mother who is unclean?

443
00:37:21,143 --> 00:37:25,112
My mother who still needs to atone
after all you've put her through?

444
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:47,134
How do you think the Mother
Above first came to us?

445
00:37:48,137 --> 00:37:49,937
How did men and women

446
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:53,507
first come to feel the
Mother's presence?

447
00:37:54,944 --> 00:37:56,711
It was through their own mothers.

448
00:37:59,448 --> 00:38:02,817
There's a great deal of falsehood
in Cersei. You know that.

449
00:38:02,919 --> 00:38:07,121
But when she speaks of you, the
Mother's love outshines it all.

450
00:38:09,158 --> 00:38:12,093
Her love for you is more real

451
00:38:12,194 --> 00:38:14,095
than anything else in this world

452
00:38:14,196 --> 00:38:17,197
because it doesn't come from this world.

453
00:38:17,299 --> 00:38:19,233
But you know that.

454
00:38:19,335 --> 00:38:21,936
You've felt it.

455
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:24,238
You've seen her when she talks to you.

456
00:38:26,342 --> 00:38:28,109
Yes.

457
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:30,410
It's a great gift.

458
00:38:30,513 --> 00:38:32,513
One I never had.

459
00:38:34,117 --> 00:38:36,150
Envy.

460
00:38:36,252 --> 00:38:38,686
One more thing for me to atone for.

461
00:38:40,156 --> 00:38:42,023
Your Grace, do you... may I?

462
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,691
Do you mind?

463
00:38:43,793 --> 00:38:45,126
It's my knees.

464
00:38:45,227 --> 00:38:47,094
Of course.

465
00:38:52,434 --> 00:38:56,336
When your mother made
her walk of atonement,

466
00:38:56,438 --> 00:38:58,639
she did it to get back to you.

467
00:38:58,741 --> 00:39:01,508
I still don't understand
why you want to put her

468
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,377
through any more than
she's already endured.

469
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:06,847
It's not what I want.
It's what the gods want.

470
00:39:06,949 --> 00:39:09,550
They make their will known
to us and it's up to us

471
00:39:09,652 --> 00:39:12,086
to either accept or reject it.

472
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,856
Please.

473
00:39:21,164 --> 00:39:24,398
If we're to be just and good,

474
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,234
then we accept it, all
of us, even kings.

475
00:39:27,336 --> 00:39:31,605
A true leader avails himself
of the wisest counsel he can.

476
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:34,141
And no one is wiser than the gods.

477
00:39:36,713 --> 00:39:39,880
My grandfather once
said something similar.

478
00:39:39,982 --> 00:39:41,816
Except for the part about the gods.

479
00:39:41,918 --> 00:39:45,820
The gods worked through him
whether he knew it or not.

480
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,123
As they work through your mother.

481
00:39:51,393 --> 00:39:53,427
There's so much good in all of us.

482
00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:57,231
The best we can do is to help
each other bring it out.

483
00:40:25,461 --> 00:40:27,228
Who are you?

484
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:28,729
No one.

485
00:40:30,633 --> 00:40:33,134
Who were you before you came here?

486
00:40:33,236 --> 00:40:34,869
Arya Stark.

487
00:40:36,873 --> 00:40:39,439
Tell me about Arya Stark's family.

488
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:42,409
Her father was Eddard Stark.

489
00:40:42,511 --> 00:40:45,045
Her mother was Catelyn Stark.

490
00:40:45,148 --> 00:40:48,482
She had one sister, Sansa,

491
00:40:48,584 --> 00:40:50,484
and four brothers.

492
00:41:00,196 --> 00:41:01,962
Three brothers.

493
00:41:02,064 --> 00:41:04,865
Robb, Bran, Rickon.

494
00:41:06,836 --> 00:41:09,736
And a half-brother Jon.

495
00:41:10,907 --> 00:41:13,240
And where are they now?

496
00:41:13,342 --> 00:41:16,310
They may be dead for all a girl knows.

497
00:41:26,588 --> 00:41:28,022
Tell me about the Hound.

498
00:41:29,926 --> 00:41:31,658
Also dead.

499
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:45,039
Arya Stark left him to die.
He was on her list.

500
00:41:47,509 --> 00:41:50,610
He was not on her list anymore.

501
00:41:50,713 --> 00:41:52,446
She had taken him off it.

502
00:41:52,548 --> 00:41:56,616
Why? Didn't she want
him dead any longer?

503
00:42:00,456 --> 00:42:02,723
She did and she did not.

504
00:42:06,229 --> 00:42:09,363
She sounds confused.

505
00:42:14,003 --> 00:42:17,872
Yes, she was.

506
00:42:22,078 --> 00:42:24,811
Who else was on Arya
Stark's funny little list?

507
00:42:25,827 --> 00:42:27,915
Cersei Lannister.

508
00:42:29,485 --> 00:42:30,650
Gregor Clegane.

509
00:42:32,588 --> 00:42:33,988
Walder Frey.

510
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,494
That's a short list.

511
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:47,001
That can't be everyone you want to kill.

512
00:42:49,671 --> 00:42:52,306
Are you sure you're not
forgetting someone?

513
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:58,412
Which name would you
like a girl to speak?

514
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,483
If a girl tells me her name,

515
00:43:36,585 --> 00:43:38,986
I will give her eyes back.

516
00:43:41,924 --> 00:43:43,890
A girl has no name.

517
00:43:47,596 --> 00:43:48,628
Come.

518
00:44:22,164 --> 00:44:24,298
If a girl is truly no one,

519
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,833
she has nothing to fear.

520
00:44:52,161 --> 00:44:54,294
Who are you?

521
00:44:57,699 --> 00:44:59,566
No one.

522
00:45:09,145 --> 00:45:12,279
The Umbers are a famously loyal house.

523
00:45:12,381 --> 00:45:14,848
Famously loyal to the Starks.

524
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:17,984
And you, Lord Karstark.

525
00:45:18,087 --> 00:45:20,887
Your people share blood with
the Starks, don't they?

526
00:45:20,989 --> 00:45:23,623
But here we are. Times change.

527
00:45:23,725 --> 00:45:26,026
When my father became
Warden of the North,

528
00:45:26,128 --> 00:45:28,128
your house refused to
pledge their banners.

529
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,996
Your father was a cunt.

530
00:45:33,202 --> 00:45:35,436
My beloved father, the Warden...

531
00:45:35,538 --> 00:45:38,672
Your father was a cunt and
that's why you killed him.

532
00:45:38,774 --> 00:45:41,608
I might have done the same to my father

533
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:44,278
if he hadn't have done me the
favor of dying on his own.

534
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:47,181
My father was poisoned by our enemies.

535
00:45:49,118 --> 00:45:52,419
Why have you come to
Winterfell, Lord Umber?

536
00:45:52,521 --> 00:45:56,356
The bastard Jon Snow led an army
of wildlings past the Wall.

537
00:45:56,459 --> 00:45:58,858
We're farther north than
any of you fuckers.

538
00:45:58,961 --> 00:46:02,229
Wildlings come down, we always
have to fight them first.

539
00:46:02,331 --> 00:46:05,566
I like fighting wildlings.
Been doing it all my life.

540
00:46:05,667 --> 00:46:08,402
But there are too many of them
for us to beat back alone.

541
00:46:08,504 --> 00:46:11,371
So now you've come seeking help?

542
00:46:11,474 --> 00:46:13,807
We need to help each other.

543
00:46:13,909 --> 00:46:17,478
The colder it gets, the farther
south those goat fuckers will roam.

544
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,546
Won't take them long to get here.

545
00:46:19,648 --> 00:46:22,483
You think a horde of wildlings
can take Winterfell?

546
00:46:22,585 --> 00:46:24,151
If they get Jon Snow
leading them, maybe.

547
00:46:24,253 --> 00:46:26,720
He knows this place
better than we ever will.

548
00:46:29,858 --> 00:46:31,992
Pledge your banners to House Bolton.

549
00:46:32,094 --> 00:46:34,628
Swear loyalty to me as
Warden of the North

550
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:37,231
and we will fight together
to destroy the bastard

551
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:38,832
and all his wildling friends.

552
00:46:38,934 --> 00:46:41,135
I'm not kissing your fucking hand.

553
00:46:41,237 --> 00:46:43,837
Traditionally a bannerman
kneels before his lord.

554
00:46:43,939 --> 00:46:45,972
I'm not doing that either.

555
00:46:46,074 --> 00:46:49,009
Why would I trust a man who
won't honor tradition?

556
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:51,945
Your father honored tradition.

557
00:46:52,047 --> 00:46:54,248
Knelt for Robb Stark.

558
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:56,750
Called him King of the North.

559
00:46:56,852 --> 00:46:59,019
Was Robb Stark right
to trust your father?

560
00:46:59,121 --> 00:47:00,920
Then it appears we're
at a bit of an impasse.

561
00:47:01,023 --> 00:47:04,158
Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths.

562
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,859
I've got a gift for you.

563
00:47:08,797 --> 00:47:11,565
A girl, I hope. I prefer redheads.

564
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:14,635
A girl, aye.

565
00:47:16,004 --> 00:47:18,038
A wild one.

566
00:47:25,714 --> 00:47:27,548
I like them wild.

567
00:47:28,617 --> 00:47:32,118
And the boy, nice and young.

568
00:47:32,221 --> 00:47:34,388
The way Karstark likes them.

569
00:47:40,196 --> 00:47:41,662
Who's this?

570
00:47:41,763 --> 00:47:44,130
Rickon Stark.

571
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,540
How do I know that's Rickon Stark?

572
00:48:24,206 --> 00:48:27,073
Welcome home, Lord Stark.

573
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,287
It's time.

574
00:49:17,693 --> 00:49:20,794
If you have any last
words, now is the time.

575
00:49:20,896 --> 00:49:23,163
You shouldn't be alive.

576
00:49:23,265 --> 00:49:25,198
It's not right.

577
00:49:26,368 --> 00:49:28,168
Neither was killing me.

578
00:49:32,508 --> 00:49:35,141
My mother's still
living at White Harbor.

579
00:49:35,243 --> 00:49:37,143
Could you write her?

580
00:49:37,245 --> 00:49:39,546
Tell her I died fighting the wildlings.

581
00:49:47,956 --> 00:49:51,692
I had a choice, Lord Commander.

582
00:49:51,794 --> 00:49:55,762
Betray you or betray the Night's Watch.

583
00:49:55,864 --> 00:49:58,932
You brought an army of
wildlings into our lands.

584
00:50:00,803 --> 00:50:03,670
An army of murderers and raiders.

585
00:50:03,772 --> 00:50:07,474
If I had to do it all over
knowing where I'd end up,

586
00:50:07,576 --> 00:50:11,010
I pray I'd make the right choice again.

587
00:50:11,112 --> 00:50:13,146
I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser.

588
00:50:13,248 --> 00:50:16,249
I fought, I lost.

589
00:50:18,086 --> 00:50:20,019
Now I rest.

590
00:50:21,022 --> 00:50:24,924
But you, Lord Snow,

591
00:50:25,026 --> 00:50:27,427
you'll be fighting
their battles forever.

592
00:52:14,603 --> 00:52:16,536
We should burn the bodies.

593
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:19,539
You should.

594
00:52:28,283 --> 00:52:30,584
What do you want me to do with this?

595
00:52:30,686 --> 00:52:32,385
Wear it.

596
00:52:32,488 --> 00:52:34,788
Burn it.

597
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:37,090
Whatever you want.

598
00:52:37,192 --> 00:52:38,692
You have Castle Black.

599
00:52:45,501 --> 00:52:47,701
My watch is ended.

600
00:52:50,157 --> 00:54:11,771
