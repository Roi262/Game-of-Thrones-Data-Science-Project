1
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,530
- I lost this dagger. 
- To whom?

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,640
Tyrion Lannister.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,340
Take a step into a more productive relationship 
with a possible ally.

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,500
I will allow you to mine the dragon glass 
and forge weapons from it.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,480
Thank you.

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,500
She has three full-grown dragons,
Your Grace.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,300
How do you propose to stop them?

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,180
We are currently at work on a solution.

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,820
I thought you'd be headed to Winterfell?

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,160
Jon Snow came down from Castle Black and the wildling army 
and won the Battle of the Bastards.

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,080
He's King of the North now.

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,000
Your sister's dead?

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,000
Euron has her.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,540
I couldn't save her. 
I tried.

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,120
You wouldn't be here if you tried.

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,940
What about Casterly Rock?

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,920
We both know how expensive war can be.

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,320
Your vaults are empty.

19
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,680
My debt will be paid in full.

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,200
How will it happen? 
Will there be pain?

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,860
No, I made sure of that.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,080
I'd hate to die like your son.

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,080
Not at all what I intended.

24
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,620
Tell Cersei, 
I want her to know it was me.

25
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,060

27
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,580
Hold the waggon!

28
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,940
You've just won the biggest prize in the world.

29
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,780
What could you possibly have to be upset about?

30
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,320
Come on, you can tell me.

31
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,860
The Queen of Thorns give you one
last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?

32
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,370
I will save my confessions
for the High Septon.

33
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,050
-There is no more High Septon.
-No there isn't, is there?

34
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,100
There is still the question of my prize.

35
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,500
That's a lot of money I just gave you.

36
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,320
It's not a castle.

37
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,530
How about that one? 
It's available.

38
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,290
You don't want Highgarden.

39
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,790
-I beg to differ.  
-We are at war.

40
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,800
Daenerys Targaryen can come and take it
back the day after you move in.

41
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,950
Besides, think of the upkeep.

42
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,260
The more you own,
the more it weighs you down.

43
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,590
Oh! Is that why you are so fucking glum,eh?

44
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,770
All your new riches weighing you down?

45
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,070
Move it!

46
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,700
They are not mine.
These all belong to the Iron Bank.

47
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,650
-We pay our debts.
-Right, just not to me.

48
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,440
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of

49
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,810
whatever nameless shitheap you're from,

50
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,080
with a saddlebag full of gold,
complaining about not getting paid.

51
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,080
When we win this war, all the castles in the
Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from.

52
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,970
with no one left to take them away from you.

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,940
Yes, I am sure Queen Cersei's reign 
will be quiet & peaceful

54
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,630
-Oh! Stranger things have happened.
-Like what?

55
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,050
The granaries are being emptied. 
I'll load it into wagons, my lord.

56
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,320
And the current harvest?

57
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,330
We have teams of men collecting it
from all the farms in the Reach.

58
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,700
Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarlys

59
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,870
and help them accelerate this process?

60
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,160
I'm not much for shoveling wheat.

61
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,060
No. But, motivating reluctant farmers
to hand over their harvest,

62
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,430
I bet you're going to have 
a real talent for that.

63
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,030
My Lord.

64
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:45,950
My Lord.

65
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,210
My Lord.

66
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,990
I must say I don't think the Iron Bank

67
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,940
has ever had a debt of this magnitude

68
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,980
repaid in a single installment.

69
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,360
I always considered your father
a very effective and efficient man,

70
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,990
but you appear to be
redefining those terms entirely.

71
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,910
You're too kind, my Lord.

72
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,530
I'm neither kind nor a lord, Your Grace.

73
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,490
I'm merely an instrument of
the institution I represent.

74
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,060
It's well-being is a matter
of arithmetic, not sentiment.

75
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,830
And the current arithmetic is outstanding.

76
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,240
-The gold...
-is on it's way.

77
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,100
My brother is supervising 
its transportation himself.

78
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,600
Some at the Iron Bank
will be disappointed.

79
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,280
They've grown rather fond 
of your interest payments.

80
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,670
We must devise a way to raise their spirits.

81
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,800
Yes, perhaps we could be of
assistance in some current venture.

82
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,880
My only venture at this moment is

83
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,980
re-estabilishing control over this continent

84
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,860
and every person on it.

85
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,360
I see a great deal of potential in that venture.

86
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,960
I imagine it will require outside investment.

87
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,800
It will, indeed.

88
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,000
I need to expand my armies, my navies.

89
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,820
My Hand, Qyburn,

90
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,330
has made overtures 
to the Golden Company in Essos.

91
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,840
I know them well.

92
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,790
They have helped us recover significant sums

93
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,430
from parties who had fallen to deep arrears.

94
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,710
It's good to hear.

95
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,740
I too would like them to recover
some things that belong to me.

96
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,600
Rest assured, Your Grace...

97
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,500
You can count on the Iron Bank's support...

98
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,390
..as soon as the gold arrives.

99
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,780
This is for you.

100
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,180
The last man who wielded it
meant to cut your throat,

101
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,020
but your mother fought him off.

102
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,120
The other dagger,

103
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,590
the one that took her life.

104
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,720
I would have stopped
that dagger with my own heart

105
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,900
If I could have.

106
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,780
I wasn't there for her 
when she needed me most.

107
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,320
But I am here for her now

108
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,260
to do what she would have done,

109
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,850
to protect her children.

110
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,600
anything I can do for you, Brandon,

111
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,700
you need only ask.

112
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,150
Do you know who this belonged to?

113
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,410
No.

114
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,190
That very question was what started
the war of the Five Kings.

115
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,710
In a way that dagger made
you what you are today.

116
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,100
Forced from your home,
driven out to the wilds beyond The Wall.

117
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,510
I imagine you've seen things

118
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,240
most men wouldn't believe.

119
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,030
To go through all of that and..
make your way home again

120
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,940
only to find such chaos in the world.

121
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,240
-I can only imagine.
-Chaos is a ladder.

122
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,020
I'm sorry to have disturbed you,
Lord Stark.

123
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,070
I'm not Lord Stark.

124
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,700
What's that?

125
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,390
Maester Wolkan built it for me
so I can move around more easily.

126
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,900
It's a very good idea.

127
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,310
You're leaving.

128
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,920
I don't want to leave you, but when...

129
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,890
..when they come,
I need to be with my family.

130
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,310
And you're safe.

131
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,840
Safe as anyone can be now.

132
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,340
You don't need me anymore.

133
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,180
No, I don't.

134
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,670
That's all you've got to say?

135
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,940
Thank you.

136
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,600
Thank you?

137
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,910
For helping me.

138
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,950
My brother died for you.

139
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,900
Hodor and Summer died for you.

140
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,890
I almost died for you.

141
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,110
-Bran...
-I'm not really...

142
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,180
Not anymore.

143
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,050
I remember what it felt
like to be Brandon Stark.

144
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,160
But I remember so much else now.

145
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,390
You died in that cave.

146
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:48,110
Yes! The kitchen girl...
the redhead with the band.

147
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,060
The only thing in the kitchen 
that you put your ... is the liver.

148
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,650
Hello. Where are you goin'?

149
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,050
In there.

150
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,170
-I live here.
-Fuck off.

151
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,100
I am Arya Stark. This is my home.

152
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,970
[laughs]

153
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,500
Arya Stark is dead.

154
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,380
Send for Maester Luwin or Ser Rodrik.

155
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,310
-They will tell you who I am.
-There is no Rodrik here.

156
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,020
The Maester's name Wolkan.

157
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,910
Go ask Jon Snow then, 
the King in the North.

158
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,950
-He's my brother.
-He's a thousand miles away.

159
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,220
It's cold and we're busy.
So, you know, better fuck off.

160
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,440
If Jon's gone, 
who's in charge of Winterfell?

161
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,920
The Lady of Winterfell?

162
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,750
-Lady Stark.
-Which Lady Stark?

163
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,640
You tell us, 
you are the one impersonating her sister.

164
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,690
Tell Sansa her sister's home.

165
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,610
Lady Sansa is too busy
to waste a breath on you.

166
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,950
Just like us. 
So for the last time, FUCK OFF.

167
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,570
I'm getting into this castle 
one way or another.

168
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,180
If I'm not who I say I am,
I won't last long.

169
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,940
But if am, and Sansa
finds out you turned me away...

170
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,440
All right. You sit there.

171
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,930
Right there.

172
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,740
Don't move!

173
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,600
Alright,

174
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,300
Go tell Lady Stark. I'll watch her.

175
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,370
I ain't telling Lady Stark. You go tell..

176
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,930
-You are going to tell her.
-I'm not.

177
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,850
Because if you don't I'm gonna hit you
right in the fucking face as hard as I can.

178
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,240
We told her to wait.

179
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,150
We were standing right next to her and...

180
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,120
When we turned around, 
she was gone, milady.

181
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,960
She is nothing, some winter town girl.

182
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,820
-She comes in asking for Ser Rodrik... and

183
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,920
Maester Luwin, yeah. And...

184
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,540
Don't trouble yourself over her, milady. 
We will find her.

185
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,410
You don't have to.

186
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,950
I know where she is.

187
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,820
Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?

188
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,300
Yes.

189
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,180
You shouldn't have run
from the guards.

190
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,280
I didn't run.

191
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,860
You need better guards.

192
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,320
It suits you... Lady Stark.

193
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,180
-Jon left you in charge? 
-He did.

194
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,020
I hope he comes back soon.

195
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,840
I remember how happy he was to see me,
and when he sees you,

196
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,290
his heart will probably stop.

197
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,560
It doesn't look like him.

198
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,920
Should've been carved
by someone who knew his face.

199
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,840
Everyone who knew his face is dead.

200
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,980
We're not.

201
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,470
They say you killed Joffrey.

202
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,700
Did you?

203
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,960
I wish I had.

204
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,000
Hmmm.

205
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,850
Me too.

206
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,170
I was angry when I heard
someone else had done it.

207
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,900
However long my list go,
he was always first.

208
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,230
-Your list?
-Of people I'm going to kill.

209
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,420
[laughs]

210
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,200
How did you get back to Winterfell?

211
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,840
It's a long story. 
I imagine yours is too.

212
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,180
Yes.

213
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,020
Not a very pleasant one.

214
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,990
Mine neither.

215
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,210
But our stories aren't over yet.

216
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,060
No, they're not.

217
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,070
Arya.

218
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,560
Bran is home too.

219
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,930
You came home.

220
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,220
I saw you at the crossroads.

221
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,790
-You saw me?
-I see quite a lot now.

222
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,990
Bran has visions.

223
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,380
I thought you might go to King's Landing.

224
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,780
So did I.

225
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,370
Why would you go back there?

226
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,840
Cersei's on her list of names.

227
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,550
Who else is on your list?

228
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,100
Most of them are dead already.

229
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,720
Where did you get this?

230
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,190
Littlefinger gave it to me.

231
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,700
Littlefinger? He's here?

232
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,410
He's declared for House Stark.
Why would he give you a dagger?

233
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,840
He thought I'd want it.

234
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,220
-Why?
-Because it was meant to kill me.

235
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,760
The cut-throat?

236
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,730
After your fall?

237
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,740
Why would a cut-throat
have a Valyrian steel dagger?

238
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,410
Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.

239
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,560
He's not a generous man.

240
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,740
He wouldn't give you anything unless
he thought he was getting something back.

241
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,520
-It doesn't matter.
-What do you mean "It doesn't matter"?

242
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,580
I don't want it.

243
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,890
Are you sure?

244
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,830
-It's Valyrian steel.
-It's wasted on a cripple.

245
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,680
Catelyn Stark would be proud.

246
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,500
You kept your vow.

247
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,990
-I did next to nothing.
-You're too hard on yourself, my lady.

248
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,810
I'm not a...!

249
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,690
Thank you, Podrick.

250
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,190
Your Grace, there is still
no word from the Unsullied.

251
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,270
Soon.

252
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,400
He will come back to you.

253
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,050
He better!

254
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,760
What happened?

255
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,310
Many things...

256
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,060
Many things?

257
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,880
Your Grace!

258
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,020
-

259
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,530
I wanted you to see it
before we start hacking it to bits.

260
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,210
Well, this is it.. 
All we'll ever need.

261
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,840
There is something else
I wanna show you, Your Grace.

262
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,590
The Children of the Forest made these.

263
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,580
When?

264
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,350
A very long time ago.

265
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:20,490
They were right here,
standing where we're standing.

266
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,400
Before there were Targaryens,
or Starks or Lannisters.

267
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,210
Maybe even before there were men.

268
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:30,810
No.

269
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,870
They were here together.

270
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,690
the Children and the First Men.

271
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,740
Doing what? 
Fighting each other?

272
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,700
They fought together

273
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,350
against their common enemy.

274
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,420
Despite their differences,
despite their suspicions.

275
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,630
Together.

276
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,820
We need to do the same
if we are gonna survive.

277
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,860
Because the enemy is real.

278
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,500
It's always been real.

279
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,640
And you say can't defeat them

280
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,940
without my armies and my dragons.

281
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,140
No, I don't think I can.

282
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,690
I will fight for you.

283
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,650
I will fight for the North.

284
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,330
When you bend the knee.

285
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,820
My people

286
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,650
won't accept a southern ruler.

287
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,110
Not after everything they have suffered.

288
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,940
They will if their King does.

289
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,640
They chose you to lead them.

290
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,800
They chose you to protect them.

291
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,350
Isn't their survival more
important than your pride?

292
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,660
What is it?

293
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,820
We took Casterly Rock.

294
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,770
That's very good to hear.

295
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:06,620
Isn't it?

296
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,270
You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves.

297
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,600
You will stay.

298
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,660
All my allies are gone.

299
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:25,410
-They've been taken from me 
while I've been sitting here on this island.
-You still have the largest army.

300
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,600
...who won't be able to eat because
Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.

301
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,540
Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.

302
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,660
We still have enough ships to carry
the Dothraki to the mainland.

303
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,090
Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.

304
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,530
We have a plan. It's still the right plan.

305
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,190
The right plan!

306
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:43,810
Your strategy has lost us
Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach.

307
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,570
-If I have underestimated our enemies--
-Our enemies?

308
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,650
Your family you mean!

309
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,640
Perhaps you don't want to 
hurt them after all.

310
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,730
Enough of the clever plans.
I have three large dragons.

311
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,740
I am going to fly them to the Red Keep.

312
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,320
We've discussed this.

313
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,810
My enemies are in the Red Keep.

314
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,510
What kind of a Queen am I
if I am not willing to risk my life to fight them?

315
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,710
A smart one.

316
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,690
What do you think I should do?

317
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,480
-I would never presume-- 
-I'm at war.

318
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,540
I'm losing.

319
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,890
What do you think I should do?

320
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,680
I never thought that 
dragons would exist again.

321
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,870
No one did.

322
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,180
The people who follow you

323
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,950
know that you made
something impossible happen.

324
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:55,020
Maybe that helps them believe that you
can make other impossible things happen.

325
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:59,290
Build a world that's different
from the shit one they've always known.

326
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:05,410
But if you use them to
melt castles and burn cities

327
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,970
You're not different.

328
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,280
You're just more of the same.

329
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,340
Don't lunge.

330
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,770
Don't go where your enemy leads you.

331
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,930
Up.

332
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,300
-And don't--
-Don't fight someone like her in the first place.

333
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,190
Nice sword.

334
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,110
Very nice dagger.

335
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,400
They haven't contributed the right
amount of grain to the stores

336
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,180
that I am afraid they'll have to make do
with what they brought. We can't--

337
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,440
It's been a while since I trained.

338
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,250
I can go and find the master-of-arms here, 
my lady.

339
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,010
He didn't beat The Hound.

340
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,830
You did.

341
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,600
I want to train with you.

342
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,850
You swore to serve both my
mother's daughters, didn't you?

343
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,090
Move aside, Podrick.

344
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,550
You can't use that, my lady. 
It's too small.

345
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,570
I won't cut you. 
Don't worry.

346
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,640
I'll try not to.

347
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,270
Who taught you how to do that?

348
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,260
No one.

349
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,290
-What do you think of her?
-Who?

350
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,640
I believe you know of whom I speak.

351
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,600
I think she has a good heart.

352
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,720
A good heart?

353
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,590
I've noticed you staring at a good heart.

354
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,670
There's no time for that.

355
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,340
I saw the Night King, Davos.
I looked into his eyes.

356
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,640
How many men do we have 
in the North to fight him?

357
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,170
-10,000 less?
-Fewer.

358
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,220
What?

359
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,420
Speaking of good hearts.
Missandei of Naath.

360
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,740
Ser Davos, Lord Snow.

361
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,410
King Snow, isn't it?

362
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,820
No, that doesn't sound right.

363
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,870
-King Jon? 
-It doesn't matter.

364
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,690
Forgive me. 
But may I ask a question?

365
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,700
Of course.

366
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,990
Your name is Jon Snow,

367
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,290
but your father's name was Ned Stark.

368
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,400
I'm a bastard.

369
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,170
My mother and father weren't married.

370
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,530
Is the custom different in Naath?

371
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:57,630
We don't have marriage in Naath,
so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.

372
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,060
It sounds... liberating.

373
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,920
Why did you leave your homeland?

374
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,320
I was stolen away by slavers.

375
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,410
I'm sorry.

376
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,010
If I may,

377
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:14,110
how did a slave girl come 
to advice Daenerys Targaryen?

378
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,410
She bought me from my master 
and set me free.

379
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,600
That was good of her.

380
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,820
Of course you are serving her now, 
aren't you?

381
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,790
I serve my Queen because
I want to serve my Queen.

382
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,540
Because I believe in her.

383
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,070
And if you wanted to sail
home to Naath tomorrow?

384
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,140
Then she would give me a ship
and wish me good fortune.

385
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,660
You believe that?

386
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,650
I know it.

387
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,210
All of us who came with her from Essos

388
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,680
We believe in her.

389
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,090
She's not our Queen because
she's the daughter of some king we never knew.

390
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,410
She is the Queen we chose.

391
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,290
Will you forgive me if I switch sides?

392
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,940
Is that a Greyjoy ship?

393
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,300
Stop!

394
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,440
Jon.

395
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,420
I didn't know you were here.

396
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,070
Sansa...

397
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,560
Is she alright?

398
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,100
What you did for her

399
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,280
is the only reason 
I am not killing you.

400
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,340
We heard your
uncle attacked your fleet.

401
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,380
We thought you were dead.

402
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,000
I should be.

403
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,690
Your sister?

404
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:34,660
Euron has her.

405
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,920
I came to ask the Queen
to help me get her back.

406
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,830
The Queen is gone.

407
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,060
Where did she go?

408
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,130
-All the gold's safely through 
the gates of King's Landing.
-Good.

409
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,960
We need to get the last of these wagons over
the Blackwater Rush before night fall.

410
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,910
If the head of the line is ambushed,
the tail will never be ought to reinforced in time.

411
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,540
We are stretched a bit thin.

412
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,950
With your permission,

413
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,370
flogging stragglers 
has a marked effect on mobility.

414
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,890
Let's give them fair warning first.

415
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:31,040
These men fought well at High Garden.

416
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,210
-Sir Jaime. 
-Rickon.

417
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,060
Dickon.

418
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,780
I hear you fought bravely at High Garden.

419
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,220
Your first battle?

420
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,520
And...?

421
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,830
It was glorious.

422
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,810
Come on, your father's not here.

423
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,940
All my life we've been placed at House Tyrell.

424
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:15,130
I knew some of those men, hunting with them.

425
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,300
They didn't deserve to die.

426
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:22,660
But Lady Olenna chose to betray her Queen
and supported Targaryen girl.

427
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:23,720
So here we are.

428
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,950
I didn't expect her to smell like that.

429
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,130
Men shit themselves when they die.

430
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,550
Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?

431
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,250
Well I learnt it when I was five.

432
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,330
What?

433
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,510
Listen.

434
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,170
Spears and shields! 
Spears and shields!

435
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,470
-What is it?
-Get in line!

436
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,100
Spears and shields! 
Spears and shields!

437
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,420
In line now!

438
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,590
Fall now!

439
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,770
Come on, lads!

440
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,980
Halt those wagons! Fall align!

441
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,420
Fall align!

442
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,710
Grab those spears!

443
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,140
Shield wall!

444
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,970
Fill the gaps!

445
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,740
In tight!

446
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,840
In line, boys!

447
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,840
[Dothraki shouting]

448
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,280
Spears out!

449
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,970
Spears out!

450
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,850
Hold the line!

451
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,070
Get back to King's Landing.

452
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,330
I'm not abandoning my army.
-You're the Commander, not a damned infantry man.

453
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,120
Those fuckers are about to swamp us.

454
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,130
We can hold them off.

455
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,850
Dracarys!

456
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,430
Hold the line!

457
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:46,600
Hold the line.

458
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,370
Hold the line.

459
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:03,740
-Archers! 
-Archers!

460
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,400
Archers, with me!

461
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,000
...to the line!

462
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,360
-Nock!
-Nock!

463
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,300
-Loose! 
-Loose!

464
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,290
-Qyburn's Scorpion is over there. 
-Go get it then.

465
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,080
I can't shoot with one hand.

466
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,180
Come on!

467
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:15,700
Where are you?

468
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,150
---

469
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,880
Take cover!

470
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:25,900
Come on, you fucker!

471
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,250
Dracarys!

472
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,730
Flee, you idiot.

473
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:44,670
Come on boy. Come on!

474
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:55,790
You fool.

475
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:57,430
You fucking idiot!
