1
00:00:21,952 --> 00:00:24,493
The war is over. Winter has come.

2
00:00:24,785 --> 00:00:26,201
The war is not over.

3
00:00:26,202 --> 00:00:28,492
The true enemy won't wait out the storm.

4
00:00:30,286 --> 00:00:33,492
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

5
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:41,577
Our uncle Euron returned
home after a long absence.

6
00:00:44,952 --> 00:00:47,576
He murdered our father, and
took the Salt Throne from Yara.

7
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:49,177
He would have murdered
us if we'd stayed.

8
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:53,202
Build me a thousand ships,
and I will give you this world.

9
00:00:55,327 --> 00:00:56,534
There's a storm coming.

10
00:00:56,535 --> 00:00:58,077
You'll be wanting a roof tonight.

11
00:00:58,535 --> 00:01:01,367
I don't have much, but I
have hidden a bit of silver

12
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:03,493
from the bandits.

13
00:01:03,702 --> 00:01:05,035
What did you do?!

14
00:01:05,036 --> 00:01:06,493
They'll both be dead come winter.

15
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:09,534
Cold winds are rising in the North.

16
00:01:09,535 --> 00:01:11,201
We need good men to help us.

17
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:14,409
You can still help a lot more
than you've harmed, Clegane.

18
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,036
It's not too late for you.

19
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,743
Send me to Oldtown.

20
00:01:18,744 --> 00:01:20,452
I'm to be the new maester.

21
00:01:21,702 --> 00:01:24,118
The Citadel has the
world's greatest library.

22
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,576
I'll learn about things
that all help when...

23
00:01:28,077 --> 00:01:29,367
... when they come.

24
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:34,577
Let go of me!

25
00:01:42,785 --> 00:01:44,827
Are you sure you're ready for this?

26
00:01:45,202 --> 00:01:49,161
I'm the three-eyed raven.
I have to be ready for this.

27
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:54,036
Do you know who had this table
carved and painted, Ser Davos?

28
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:55,244
Aegon Targaryen.

29
00:01:55,952 --> 00:01:58,826
Aegon used to live here, and
the Targaryens built this castle.

30
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,107
Aye. So they did.

31
00:02:00,535 --> 00:02:03,577
I want us both to go home.
But they took it from us.

32
00:02:03,785 --> 00:02:05,244
How do we go home?

33
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:07,709
You're in the great game now,

34
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,577
and the great game's
terrifying. Are you afraid?

35
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:16,826
My name is Arya Stark.
I want you to know that.

36
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,411
You're wondering why
I brought you all here.

37
00:03:01,412 --> 00:03:04,870
After all, we just had a feast.

38
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:07,828
Since when does old Walder

39
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:10,828
give us two feasts
in a single fortnight?

40
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:16,287
Well, it's no good being
Lord of the Riverlands

41
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:18,661
if you can't celebrate with your family.

42
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:20,162
That's what I say!

43
00:03:20,163 --> 00:03:23,578
Yes!

44
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:31,328
I've gathered every Frey
who means a damn thing

45
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:36,661
so I can tell you my
plans for this great house

46
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:39,536
now that winter has come.

47
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:42,704
But first, a toast!

48
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:47,953
No more of that Dornish horse piss!

49
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:50,911
This is the finest Arbor gold!

50
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,911
Proper wine for proper heroes!

51
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,287
Stand together!

52
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:03,537
Stand together!

53
00:04:12,288 --> 00:04:13,703
Not you.

54
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:16,620
I'm not wasting good
wine on a damn woman.

55
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:24,661
Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man.

56
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:28,078
I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot.

57
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,203
You're my family, the men who helped me

58
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,245
slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding.

59
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:38,369
Yes, yes.

60
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,037
Cheer.

61
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:44,369
Brave men, all of you.

62
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,953
Butchered a woman
pregnant with her babe.

63
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:53,786
Cut the throat of a mother of five.

64
00:04:53,787 --> 00:04:56,911
Slaughtered your guests
after inviting them

65
00:04:56,912 --> 00:04:58,662
into your home.

66
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:05,953
But you didn't slaughter
every one of the Starks.

67
00:05:05,954 --> 00:05:10,703
No, no, that was your mistake.

68
00:05:10,704 --> 00:05:14,578
You should have ripped
them all out, root and stem.

69
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,453
Leave one wolf alive

70
00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:26,121
and the sheep are never safe.

71
00:05:51,746 --> 00:05:54,038
When people ask you
what happened here...

72
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:57,329
tell them the North remembers.

73
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:02,662
Tell them winter came for House Frey.

You wildlings?

76
00:10:26,871 --> 00:10:29,787
I'm Meera Reed,
daughter of Howland Reed.

77
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:33,287
This is Brandon Stark,

78
00:10:33,288 --> 00:10:35,495
son of Ned Stark.

79
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:41,329
How do I know that's true?

80
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:47,828
You were at the Fist of the First Men.

81
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:49,288
You were at Hardhome.

82
00:10:51,454 --> 00:10:53,163
You've seen the Army of the Dead.

83
00:10:55,038 --> 00:10:56,412
You've seen the Night King.

84
00:10:57,495 --> 00:10:59,495
He's coming for us.

85
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,829
For all of us.

86
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:11,578
Okay, come on.

87
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:13,662
Let's get them inside.

88
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:45,953
I want every northern
maester to scour their records

89
00:11:45,954 --> 00:11:49,120
for any mention of dragonglass.

90
00:11:49,121 --> 00:11:51,203
Dragonglass kills white walkers.

91
00:11:51,204 --> 00:11:53,870
It's more valuable to us now than gold.

92
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:55,536
We need to find it, we need to mine it,

93
00:11:55,537 --> 00:11:57,246
we need to make weapons from it.

94
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:01,578
Everyone aged 10 to 60

95
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:04,828
will drill daily with
spears, pikes, bow and arrow.

96
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:08,037
It's about time we taught these
boys of summer how to fight.

97
00:12:08,038 --> 00:12:10,328
Not just the boys.

98
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,828
We can't defend the North

99
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:14,995
if only half the population is fighting.

100
00:12:14,996 --> 00:12:19,703
You expect me to put a spear
in my granddaughter's hand?

101
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:23,369
I don't plan on knitting by
the fire while men fight for me.

102
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,453
I might be small, Lord
Glover, and I might be a girl,

103
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,911
but I am every bit as
much a Northerner as you.

104
00:12:28,912 --> 00:12:30,786
Indeed you are, my lady.
No one has questioned...

105
00:12:30,787 --> 00:12:32,912
And I don't need your
permission to defend the North.

106
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:40,661
We'll begin training every man,
woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island.

107
00:12:40,662 --> 00:12:42,745
Aye!

108
00:12:42,746 --> 00:12:44,245
While we're preparing for attack,

109
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:46,578
we need to shore up our defenses.

110
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:48,205
The only thing standing between us

111
00:12:48,206 --> 00:12:50,070
and the Army of the Dead is the Wall,

112
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,995
and the Wall hasn't been
properly manned in centuries.

113
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:56,412
I'm not the king of the Free Folk.

114
00:12:57,954 --> 00:13:00,287
But if we're going to survive
this winter together...

115
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:04,494
You want us to man the castles for you?

116
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:06,078
Aye.

117
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,911
Last time we saw the
Night King was at Hardhome.

118
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:12,245
The closest castle to Hardhome
is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

119
00:13:12,246 --> 00:13:13,786
Then that's where I'll go.

120
00:13:13,787 --> 00:13:16,953
Looks like we're the Night's Watch now.

121
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:20,828
If they breach the Wall,

122
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:22,369
the first two castles in their path

123
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,911
are Last Hearth and Karhold.

124
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:28,578
The Umbers and the
Karstarks betrayed the North.

125
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:30,203
Their castles should be torn down

126
00:13:30,204 --> 00:13:31,953
with not a stone left standing.

127
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:34,536
The castles committed no crimes.

128
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:37,953
And we need every fortress
we have for the war to come.

129
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:41,287
We should give the Last Hearth
and Karhold to new families,

130
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,828
loyal families who
supported us against Ramsay.

131
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:47,037
Aye!

132
00:13:47,038 --> 00:13:49,328
The Umbers and the Karstarks

133
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,828
have fought beside the
Starks for centuries.

134
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:54,439
They've kept faith for
generation after generation.

135
00:13:54,441 --> 00:13:55,995
And then they broke faith.

136
00:13:55,996 --> 00:13:59,078
I'm not going to strip these
families of their ancestral homes

137
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:01,661
because of the crimes
of a few reckless sons.

138
00:14:01,662 --> 00:14:03,328
So there's no punishment for treason

139
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:05,829
and no reward for loyalty?

140
00:14:10,996 --> 00:14:13,661
The punishment for treason is death.

141
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:16,494
Smalljon Umber died
on the field of battle.

142
00:14:16,495 --> 00:14:19,328
Harald Karstark died
on the field of battle.

143
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:21,745
They died fighting for Ramsay.

144
00:14:21,746 --> 00:14:23,328
Give the castles to the families

145
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,703
of the men who died fighting for you.

146
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:41,829
When I was Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch...

147
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:45,661
I executed men who betrayed me.

148
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:49,911
I executed men who
refused to follow orders.

149
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:51,703
My father always said,

150
00:14:51,704 --> 00:14:54,287
"The man who passes the
sentence should swing the sword,"

151
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:57,578
and I have tried to live by those words.

152
00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:01,037
But I will not punish a
son for his father's sins,

153
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:03,494
and I will not take a family home away

154
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:06,870
from a family it has
belonged to for centuries.

155
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:09,453
That is my decision,

156
00:15:09,454 --> 00:15:12,038
and my decision is final.

157
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:19,246
Ned Umber.

158
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:28,579
Alys Karstark.

159
00:15:43,537 --> 00:15:45,411
For centuries, our families fought

160
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:48,245
side by side on the battlefield.

161
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:53,245
I ask you to pledge your loyalty
once again to House Stark,

162
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:55,786
to serve as our bannermen

163
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:58,495
and come to our aid
whenever called upon.

164
00:16:07,288 --> 00:16:08,412
Stand.

165
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:14,911
Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore.

166
00:16:14,912 --> 00:16:17,911
The North needs to band together,

167
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:19,288
all the living north.

168
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,953
Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys,

169
00:16:22,954 --> 00:16:25,203
now and always?

170
00:16:25,204 --> 00:16:27,661
Now and always!

171
00:16:46,787 --> 00:16:49,037
You are my sister, but I am king now.

172
00:16:49,038 --> 00:16:50,661
Will you start wearing a crown?

173
00:16:50,662 --> 00:16:52,287
When you question my decisions

174
00:16:52,288 --> 00:16:54,453
in front of the other lords
and ladies, you undermine me.

175
00:16:54,454 --> 00:16:56,064
So I can't question
your decisions anymore?

176
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:57,162
Of course you can, but...

177
00:16:57,163 --> 00:16:59,494
Joffrey never let anyone
question his authority.

178
00:16:59,495 --> 00:17:01,495
You think he was a good king?

179
00:17:03,163 --> 00:17:05,121
Do you think I'm Joffrey?

180
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:11,661
You're as far from Joffrey
as anyone I've ever met.

181
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:13,163
Thank you.

182
00:17:14,787 --> 00:17:16,870
You're good at this, you know.

183
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:19,328
- At what?
- At ruling.

184
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,162
No.

185
00:17:21,163 --> 00:17:22,163
You are.

186
00:17:23,204 --> 00:17:24,662
You are.

187
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,453
They respect you, they really do,

188
00:17:28,454 --> 00:17:30,619
but you have to...

189
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,037
Why are you laughing?

190
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:34,203
What did father used to say?

191
00:17:34,204 --> 00:17:37,536
Everything before the
word "but" is horse shit.

192
00:17:37,537 --> 00:17:39,037
He never said that to me.

193
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:41,745
No. No, he never cursed
in front of his girls.

194
00:17:41,746 --> 00:17:44,828
Because he was trying to protect us.

195
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:47,828
He never wanted us to see
how dirty the world really is,

196
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:50,536
but Father couldn't protect
me and neither can you.

197
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:51,822
Stop trying.

198
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:53,245
All right, I'll stop
trying to protect you

199
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:54,619
and you stop trying to undermine me.

200
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,829
I'm not trying to undermine you!

201
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,411
You have to be smarter than Father.

202
00:18:01,412 --> 00:18:04,078
You need to be smarter than Robb.

203
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,203
I loved them, I miss them,
but they made stupid mistakes,

204
00:18:07,204 --> 00:18:09,245
and they both lost their heads for it.

205
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:11,453
And how should I be smarter?

206
00:18:11,454 --> 00:18:12,912
By listening to you?

207
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,245
Would that be so terrible?

208
00:18:18,246 --> 00:18:21,204
A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace.

209
00:18:30,204 --> 00:18:33,245
"Cersei of House Lannister,
First of Her Name,

210
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:35,162
Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

211
00:18:35,163 --> 00:18:36,786
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms..."

212
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:38,246
What does she want?

213
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:42,287
Come to King's Landing.

214
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:46,120
Bend the knee or suffer
the fate of all traitors.

215
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:48,245
You've been so consumed
with the enemy to the north,

216
00:18:48,246 --> 00:18:50,078
you've forgotten about
the one to the south.

217
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,120
I'm consumed with the Night
King because I've seen him.

218
00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:55,745
And believe me, you'd think
of little else if you had, too.

219
00:18:55,746 --> 00:18:57,453
We still have a wall between
us and the Night King.

220
00:18:57,454 --> 00:18:59,287
There's nothing between us and Cersei.

221
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:02,203
There's a thousand miles
between us and Cersei.

222
00:19:02,204 --> 00:19:04,995
Winter is here. The
Lannisters are a southern army.

223
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:06,453
They've never ranged this far north.

224
00:19:06,454 --> 00:19:09,786
You're the military man, but I know her.

225
00:19:09,787 --> 00:19:13,120
If you're her enemy, she'll never
stop until she's destroyed you.

226
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:16,288
Everyone who's ever crossed
her, she's found a way to murder.

227
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,454
You almost sound as if you admire her.

228
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:27,288
I learned a great deal from her.

229
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:05,995
What is this?

230
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,661
It's what we've been
waiting for our whole lives.

231
00:20:08,662 --> 00:20:11,453
It's what Father trained us
for, whether he knew it or not.

232
00:20:11,454 --> 00:20:12,953
He knew it.

233
00:20:12,954 --> 00:20:14,911
Made me memorize every damn city, town,

234
00:20:14,912 --> 00:20:16,494
lake, forest, and mountain.

235
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:18,662
It's ours now. We just have to take it.

236
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:22,536
You've been quiet since you came home.

237
00:20:22,537 --> 00:20:23,995
Are you angry with me?

238
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:26,246
No, not angry.

239
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,370
Are you afraid of me?

240
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,495
Should I be?

241
00:20:35,288 --> 00:20:39,203
Daenerys Targaryen has
chosen Tyrion to be her Hand.

242
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,995
Right now, they're sailing
across the Narrow Sea,

243
00:20:41,996 --> 00:20:44,995
hoping to take back her father's throne.

244
00:20:44,996 --> 00:20:47,411
Our little brother,

245
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,578
the one you love so much,

246
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:51,411
the one you set free,

247
00:20:51,412 --> 00:20:54,703
the one who murdered our
father and our first-born son,

248
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:58,038
now he stands beside our
enemies and gives them counsel.

249
00:21:01,746 --> 00:21:05,745
He's out there somewhere
at the head of an armada.

250
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:07,454
Where will they land?

251
00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:11,578
Dragonstone.

252
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:14,369
They have deep-water
ports for the ships.

253
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,369
Stannis left the castle unoccupied,

254
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,828
and that's where she was born.

255
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:20,120
Enemies to the east.

256
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:21,911
Enemies to the south...

257
00:21:21,912 --> 00:21:24,911
Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.

258
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:26,745
Enemies to the west...

259
00:21:26,746 --> 00:21:28,578
Olenna, the old cunt.

260
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,786
Another traitor.

261
00:21:31,787 --> 00:21:33,953
Enemies to the north.

262
00:21:33,954 --> 00:21:37,078
Ned Stark's bastard has
been named King in the North

263
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:40,078
and that murdering whore
Sansa stands beside him.

264
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:42,745
Enemies everywhere. We're
surrounded by traitors.

265
00:21:42,746 --> 00:21:44,453
You're in command of
the Lannister army now.

266
00:21:44,454 --> 00:21:47,578
- How do we proceed?
- Winter is here.

267
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:50,870
We can't win a war if we can't
feed our men and our horses.

268
00:21:50,871 --> 00:21:55,037
The Tyrells have the grain,
the Tyrells have the livestock.

269
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:57,078
Will the Tyrell
bannermen stand alongside

270
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:00,369
a Dothraki horde and
Unsullied slave soldiers?

271
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,037
If they think Daenerys will win.

272
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:04,995
No one wants to fight
on the losing side.

273
00:22:04,996 --> 00:22:08,121
Right now, we look like the losing side.

274
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,245
I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

275
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,995
Three kingdoms, at best.

276
00:22:13,996 --> 00:22:16,536
I'm not sure you understand
how much danger we're in.

277
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:18,328
I understand we're
in a war for survival.

278
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:21,369
I understand whoever loses dies.

279
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,661
I understand whoever wins
could launch a dynasty

280
00:22:23,662 --> 00:22:25,245
that lasts a thousand years.

281
00:22:25,246 --> 00:22:27,828
A dynasty for whom?

282
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:30,828
Our children are dead.

283
00:22:30,829 --> 00:22:32,287
We're the last of us.

284
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:34,329
A dynasty for us, then.

285
00:22:37,495 --> 00:22:39,038
We never talked about Tommen.

286
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:43,995
There's nothing to say.

287
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,953
Our baby boy killed himself.

288
00:22:45,954 --> 00:22:47,494
He betrayed me.

289
00:22:47,495 --> 00:22:48,995
He betrayed us both.

290
00:22:48,996 --> 00:22:50,828
Should we spend our
days mourning the dead...

291
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:52,245
Mother, father, and all our children?

292
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,828
- Cersei...
- I loved them. I did.

293
00:22:54,829 --> 00:22:58,037
But they're ashes now and
we're still flesh and blood.

294
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:01,038
We're the last Lannisters,
the last ones who count.

295
00:23:06,871 --> 00:23:09,536
Even Lannisters can't
survive without allies.

296
00:23:09,537 --> 00:23:12,703
Where are our allies now?

297
00:23:12,704 --> 00:23:14,911
You saw what happened to
Walder Frey and his family.

298
00:23:14,912 --> 00:23:16,578
I heard.

299
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:19,120
- How could we ever trust a man like that?
- We couldn't.

300
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:21,120
He was a useless, old coward,

301
00:23:21,121 --> 00:23:22,953
but the Freys supported us.

302
00:23:22,954 --> 00:23:24,328
Now they're all dead.

303
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:26,037
Whoever killed them
is no friend of ours.

304
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:27,578
We need allies.

305
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:29,369
Stronger, better allies.

306
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,495
We can't win this war alone.

307
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:37,121
You think I listened to Father
for 40 years and learned nothing?

308
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:15,619
The Greyjoys?

309
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,203
You invited the Greyjoys
to King's Landing?

310
00:24:18,204 --> 00:24:21,037
- Not all of them.
- Well, it looks like all of them.

311
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:22,619
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

312
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,120
the new King of the Iron Islands.

313
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:27,828
You said yourself we needed
stronger, better allies.

314
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:30,953
- There you are.
- How are they better allies?

315
00:24:30,954 --> 00:24:33,369
How are they different from the Freys?

316
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,953
They both broke their promises

317
00:24:34,954 --> 00:24:37,245
and murdered their former
friends as soon as it suited them.

318
00:24:37,246 --> 00:24:40,245
So does everyone when it suits them.

319
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:42,870
Unlike the Freys, they have ships.

320
00:24:42,871 --> 00:24:45,494
- And they're good at killing.
- They're not good at anything.

321
00:24:45,495 --> 00:24:48,911
I know the ironborn. They're
bitter, angry little people.

322
00:24:48,912 --> 00:24:50,484
All they know how to do is steal things

323
00:24:50,485 --> 00:24:52,085
they can't build or grow themselves.

324
00:24:52,121 --> 00:24:54,245
Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.

325
00:24:54,246 --> 00:24:56,287
Oh, what did he come here for, then?

326
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:57,954
A queen.

327
00:25:10,662 --> 00:25:13,870
The moment I was chosen
Lord of the Iron Islands,

328
00:25:13,871 --> 00:25:16,245
they turned on me.

329
00:25:16,246 --> 00:25:17,494
Their own uncle.

330
00:25:17,495 --> 00:25:20,120
They stole my best ships and ran.

331
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:22,287
Sailed them right across the world

332
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:24,578
and gave them to the Dragon Queen

333
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:28,037
so she could bring her
armies here to attack you.

334
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:31,494
It's nothing compared to
the treason you suffered

335
00:25:31,495 --> 00:25:35,162
at the hands of a family
member, from what I hear.

336
00:25:35,163 --> 00:25:37,871
But still, it bothers me.

337
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:42,536
Murdering them would
make me feel a lot better.

338
00:25:42,537 --> 00:25:46,703
And since it appears that all
our treasonous family members

339
00:25:46,704 --> 00:25:48,619
are fighting for the same side,

340
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,162
I thought we rightful monarchs

341
00:25:51,163 --> 00:25:53,746
could murder them together.

342
00:25:59,746 --> 00:26:02,537
You're not a rightful
monarch, though, are you?

343
00:26:06,662 --> 00:26:09,661
The Greyjoys rebelled against the
throne for the right to be monarchs,

344
00:26:09,662 --> 00:26:13,703
but as I recall, you
were soundly defeated.

345
00:26:13,704 --> 00:26:15,536
Come to mention it,

346
00:26:15,537 --> 00:26:17,911
weren't you the one who
started that rebellion

347
00:26:17,912 --> 00:26:22,120
by sailing to Casterly Rock
and burning the Lannister fleet?

348
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:23,828
You certainly caught us there.

349
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:26,661
Very smart move on your part.

350
00:26:26,662 --> 00:26:30,911
Of course, we all made it
to the Iron Islands anyway.

351
00:26:30,912 --> 00:26:32,120
I was there.

352
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:33,953
I remember very well.

353
00:26:33,954 --> 00:26:35,494
I saw you.

354
00:26:35,495 --> 00:26:37,786
I heard so much talk.

355
00:26:37,787 --> 00:26:41,411
The best in the world.
No one can stop him.

356
00:26:41,412 --> 00:26:43,120
I didn't believe it, to be honest.

357
00:26:43,121 --> 00:26:46,411
But I must say when you
rushed through the breach

358
00:26:46,412 --> 00:26:48,579
and started cutting people down...

359
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,786
it was glorious.

360
00:26:53,787 --> 00:26:55,203
Like a dance.

361
00:26:55,204 --> 00:26:58,411
The people I was cutting
down were your own kin.

362
00:26:58,412 --> 00:27:00,745
The place was getting crowded.

363
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:03,328
I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.

364
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:05,536
And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.

365
00:27:05,537 --> 00:27:07,995
A good thing for me.

366
00:27:07,996 --> 00:27:11,619
If you hadn't crushed us, I
wouldn't have gone into exile.

367
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,536
If I hadn't done that,

368
00:27:13,537 --> 00:27:17,121
I wouldn't be the greatest
captain on the 14 seas.

369
00:27:18,163 --> 00:27:19,996
If not the most humble.

370
00:27:21,288 --> 00:27:22,288
You're not humble.

371
00:27:24,246 --> 00:27:26,246
You're the queen of a great nation.

372
00:27:27,537 --> 00:27:29,203
You don't care about the Iron Islands.

373
00:27:29,204 --> 00:27:33,870
They're nothing but
rocks and bird shit and...

374
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:36,745
And a lot of very unattractive people.

375
00:27:36,746 --> 00:27:39,369
The Iron Fleet, on the other hand,

376
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:42,494
that's something else entirely.

377
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:45,786
It's the greatest armada
Westeros has ever seen.

378
00:27:45,787 --> 00:27:50,369
With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas.

379
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:53,203
You can defeat the invaders of the east

380
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:56,162
and the pretenders of
the north and south.

381
00:27:56,163 --> 00:27:57,787
What do you want in return?

382
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:02,911
Ever since I was a little boy,

383
00:28:02,912 --> 00:28:04,828
I wanted to grow up and marry

384
00:28:04,829 --> 00:28:06,953
the most beautiful woman in the world.

385
00:28:06,954 --> 00:28:09,661
So here I am,

386
00:28:09,662 --> 00:28:12,120
with a thousand ships

387
00:28:12,121 --> 00:28:13,662
and two good hands.

388
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,662
I decline your proposal.

389
00:28:23,163 --> 00:28:24,203
Why?

390
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:25,871
You're not trustworthy.

391
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,369
You've broken promises to allies before

392
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,828
and murdered them at
the nearest opportunity.

393
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:33,370
You murdered your own brother.

394
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:37,037
You should try it. Feels wonderful.

395
00:28:38,662 --> 00:28:40,703
I don't expect you to trust me outright.

396
00:28:40,704 --> 00:28:43,078
You need proof of my honest intentions.

397
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,536
In my experience,

398
00:28:44,537 --> 00:28:47,536
the surest way to a woman's
heart is with a gift.

399
00:28:47,537 --> 00:28:49,828
A priceless gift.

400
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:51,703
I won't return to King's Landing

401
00:28:51,704 --> 00:28:53,746
until I have that for you.

402
00:31:59,746 --> 00:32:02,578
Ah, Maester Weyland.

403
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:06,079
A drinker's liver if ever I saw one.

404
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:08,329
Weigh that.

405
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:12,786
The triumph of transitory pleasures.

406
00:32:12,787 --> 00:32:14,703
Mankind's curse.

407
00:32:14,704 --> 00:32:17,786
Archmaester, I was wondering...

408
00:32:17,787 --> 00:32:19,745
What's the weight?

409
00:32:19,746 --> 00:32:22,704
Um, 147.

410
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,703
I was wondering if you had
considered my proposition.

411
00:32:28,704 --> 00:32:31,786
I don't remember your proposition.

412
00:32:31,787 --> 00:32:35,078
I asked you if, in light of
what I've seen in the North,

413
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:38,245
if I could have access to the
restricted area of the library.

414
00:32:38,246 --> 00:32:39,953
That area is reserved for maesters.

415
00:32:39,954 --> 00:32:42,453
- Are you a maester?
- No.

416
00:32:42,454 --> 00:32:44,579
Not a very strong proposition, is it?

417
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,536
Archmaester, with respect,

418
00:32:56,537 --> 00:32:58,369
I've seen them...

419
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,619
The Army of the Dead.

420
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,995
The white walkers.

421
00:33:02,996 --> 00:33:05,494
I was sent here to
learn how to defeat them,

422
00:33:05,495 --> 00:33:08,037
but everyone in the Citadel,

423
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:10,203
those who will even talk to me,

424
00:33:10,204 --> 00:33:13,037
they all doubt the walkers
ever existed in the first place.

425
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:15,578
Everyone in the Citadel
doubts everything.

426
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:16,662
It's their job.

427
00:33:22,204 --> 00:33:25,495
But the tales of the Long
Night can't be pure fabrication.

428
00:33:27,329 --> 00:33:30,245
Too many similarities
from unconnected sources.

429
00:33:30,246 --> 00:33:32,828
Sources in the restricted area?

430
00:33:32,829 --> 00:33:34,454
The very same.

431
00:33:35,746 --> 00:33:37,203
And the simplest explanation

432
00:33:37,204 --> 00:33:40,162
for your grating obsession
with the white walkers

433
00:33:40,163 --> 00:33:41,661
is that you're telling the truth

434
00:33:41,662 --> 00:33:44,786
and that you saw what you say you saw.

435
00:33:44,787 --> 00:33:47,662
So, you believe me.

436
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:50,494
I do.

437
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,204
You'll finish weighing that heart?

438
00:33:54,495 --> 00:33:57,329
That makes you the only person
south of the Twins who does.

439
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:03,203
We're not like the
people south of the Twins.

440
00:34:03,204 --> 00:34:05,412
And we're not like the
people north of the Twins.

441
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:11,662
In the Citadel, we lead different
lives for different reasons.

442
00:34:13,537 --> 00:34:16,328
We are this world's
memory, Samwell Tarly.

443
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:19,287
Without us, men would be
little better than dogs.

444
00:34:19,288 --> 00:34:21,453
Don't remember any meal but the last,

445
00:34:21,454 --> 00:34:24,120
can't see forward to any but the next.

446
00:34:24,121 --> 00:34:26,287
And every time you leave
the house and shut the door,

447
00:34:26,288 --> 00:34:29,203
they howl like you're gone forever.

448
00:34:29,204 --> 00:34:32,203
When Robert's Rebellion was raging,

449
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:34,037
people thought the end was near.

450
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:37,120
The end of the Targaryen
dynasty. "How will we survive?"

451
00:34:37,121 --> 00:34:40,578
When Aegon Targaryen
turned his eye westward

452
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,536
and flew his dragons
to Blackwater Rush...

453
00:34:42,537 --> 00:34:44,578
"The end is near! How will we survive?"

454
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:47,453
And thousands of years before
that, during the Long Night,

455
00:34:47,454 --> 00:34:49,578
we can forgive them for
thinking it truly was the end.

456
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:52,288
But it wasn't. None of it was.

457
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,620
The Wall has stood through it all.

458
00:34:57,912 --> 00:35:00,871
And every winter that
ever came has ended.

459
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:11,246
Be a good lad. Clean this up.

460
00:36:01,038 --> 00:36:02,746
Nope.

461
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:14,871
Nope.

462
00:36:27,288 --> 00:36:29,329
You're a lucky man.

463
00:36:33,787 --> 00:36:36,662
I've heard she beat the
Hound in single combat.

464
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,954
She's a very impressive woman.

465
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,495
What do you want, Lord Baelish?

466
00:36:49,871 --> 00:36:51,870
I want you to be happy.

467
00:36:51,871 --> 00:36:54,245
I want you to be safe.

468
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:55,536
I am safe.

469
00:36:55,537 --> 00:36:58,703
I'm at home, surrounded by friends.

470
00:36:58,704 --> 00:37:02,079
I have Brienne to protect me
from anyone who would harm me.

471
00:37:05,954 --> 00:37:07,746
What about happy?

472
00:37:10,412 --> 00:37:12,245
Why aren't you happy?

473
00:37:12,246 --> 00:37:14,203
What do you want that you do not have?

474
00:37:14,204 --> 00:37:16,953
At the moment, peace and quiet.

475
00:37:22,121 --> 00:37:25,245
No need to seize the
last word, Lord Baelish.

476
00:37:25,246 --> 00:37:27,620
I'll assume it was something clever.

477
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:31,453
My lady.

478
00:37:31,454 --> 00:37:33,246
My lady.

479
00:37:43,746 --> 00:37:45,287
Why is he still here?

480
00:37:45,288 --> 00:37:48,037
We need his men.

481
00:37:48,038 --> 00:37:51,620
Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton
would still hold this castle.

482
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,620
Littlefinger saved us.

483
00:37:58,746 --> 00:38:00,412
He wants something.

484
00:38:02,204 --> 00:38:04,537
I know exactly what he wants.

485
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:13,287
♪ He rode through the
streets of the city ♪

486
00:38:13,288 --> 00:38:16,328
♪ Down from his hill on high ♪

487
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:19,911
♪ O'er the winds and the
steps and the cobbles ♪

488
00:38:19,912 --> 00:38:23,411
♪ He rode to a woman's sigh ♪

489
00:38:23,412 --> 00:38:26,619
♪ For she was his secret treasure ♪

490
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:30,037
♪ She was his shame and his bliss ♪

491
00:38:30,038 --> 00:38:32,953
♪ And a chain and
a keep are nothing ♪

492
00:38:32,954 --> 00:38:35,619
♪ Compared to a woman's kiss ♪

493
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:39,120
♪ For hands of gold
are always cold ♪

494
00:38:39,121 --> 00:38:41,786
♪ But a woman's hands are warm ♪

495
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:45,619
♪ For hands of gold
are always cold ♪

496
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,620
♪ But a woman's hands are... ♪

497
00:38:49,912 --> 00:38:51,369
That's a pretty song.

498
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,453
I've never heard it before.

499
00:38:52,454 --> 00:38:53,911
It's a new one.

500
00:38:53,912 --> 00:38:56,911
Are you hungry? We've got some rabbit.

501
00:38:56,912 --> 00:38:58,369
I don't want to steal your food.

502
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,745
You're not stealing, we're offering.

503
00:39:00,746 --> 00:39:03,121
Come on, it's gonna be a cold night.

504
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,120
You heading south?

505
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,203
King's Landing.

506
00:39:35,204 --> 00:39:37,287
Poor girl.

507
00:39:37,288 --> 00:39:39,953
Not so bad, is it?

508
00:39:39,954 --> 00:39:42,078
Depends on your taste, I guess.

509
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,500
If you like your streets
covered in shit and pig's blood,

510
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:46,078
it's the town for you.

511
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,203
All my life, I wanted
to see the Red Keep,

512
00:39:48,204 --> 00:39:50,369
the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit.

513
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,328
Then when I finally make it,

514
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:54,536
they wouldn't let me within
a mile of the Red Keep,

515
00:39:54,537 --> 00:39:56,494
the Sept of Baelor's blown to hell,

516
00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:58,453
and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin.

517
00:39:58,454 --> 00:40:00,328
The people who live there,

518
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:03,037
they'd skin you alive if they could
make two coppers off your hide.

519
00:40:03,038 --> 00:40:05,162
Worst place in the world.

520
00:40:05,163 --> 00:40:07,536
What are you doing in the Riverlands?

521
00:40:07,537 --> 00:40:10,120
There's been some trouble
with the Freys up at the Twins,

522
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:13,454
so we're part of the army that's
been sent to keep the peace.

523
00:40:16,537 --> 00:40:19,369
Here you go. Guests first.

524
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,494
Oh, no, I couldn't.
You don't have enough.

525
00:40:21,495 --> 00:40:23,953
My mother always told me
to be kind to strangers.

526
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:25,912
Strangers will be kind to you.

527
00:40:38,412 --> 00:40:40,494
You're a long way from home.

528
00:40:40,495 --> 00:40:42,578
I'm sure you've had
some adventures, though.

529
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:45,411
Yeah, endless adventures.

530
00:40:45,412 --> 00:40:47,412
They'll be singing about
us for a thousand years.

531
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,745
The truth is when we left home,
we couldn't wait to get away.

532
00:40:51,746 --> 00:40:54,078
But now we've been gone a
while, we can't wait to get home.

533
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,120
I just think about my dad out
there on his boat all alone.

534
00:40:58,121 --> 00:40:59,495
I ought to be out there with him.

535
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,453
My wife just had our first baby.

536
00:41:03,454 --> 00:41:05,745
- Boy or girl?
- Oh, who knows?

537
00:41:05,746 --> 00:41:07,911
You think soldiers get
ravens with news from home?

538
00:41:11,704 --> 00:41:14,369
- I hope it's a girl.
- Why?

539
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:17,328
Girls take care of their papas
when their papas grow old.

540
00:41:17,329 --> 00:41:19,329
Boys just go off to fight
in someone else's wars.

541
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:23,912
Are you old enough to drink?

542
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,245
It's blackberry wine.

543
00:41:41,246 --> 00:41:42,537
I made it myself.

544
00:41:43,996 --> 00:41:45,121
It's really good.

545
00:41:47,246 --> 00:41:50,620
So, why is a nice girl on her
own heading to King's Landing?

546
00:41:58,163 --> 00:42:00,163
I'm going to kill the queen.

547
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,536
Bad night to be outdoors.

548
00:42:23,537 --> 00:42:26,369
You've got real powerful
magic to figure that out.

549
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:30,453
Did the Lord of Light
whisper that in your ear?

550
00:42:30,454 --> 00:42:33,619
"It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy.

551
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,578
It's gonna be a cold night."

552
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:40,453
You're a grouchy old
bear, aren't you, Clegane?

553
00:42:40,454 --> 00:42:42,120
You want some rum?

554
00:42:42,121 --> 00:42:45,203
Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.

555
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:47,246
Why are you always in such a foul mood?

556
00:42:49,412 --> 00:42:51,537
Experience.

557
00:42:55,704 --> 00:42:57,996
This seems like a good
place to spend the night.

558
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:03,078
These people don't want us here.

559
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:05,995
Seems deserted to me. No livestock.

560
00:43:05,996 --> 00:43:07,954
No smoke coming from the chimney.

561
00:43:27,495 --> 00:43:28,911
I don't like the look of it.

562
00:43:28,912 --> 00:43:31,911
For a big, hard man, you scare easy.

563
00:43:31,912 --> 00:43:34,536
I'll tell you what doesn't scare me...

564
00:43:34,537 --> 00:43:36,536
Bald cocksuckers like you.

565
00:43:36,537 --> 00:43:39,411
You think you're fooling
anyone with that top knot?

566
00:43:39,412 --> 00:43:41,204
Bald cunt.

567
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:44,828
Come on.

568
00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:46,662
Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.

569
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:49,786
They don't.

570
00:43:52,704 --> 00:43:54,369
See if there's a larder.

571
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:56,079
They always leave something behind.

572
00:44:37,746 --> 00:44:39,106
How do you think it ended for them?

573
00:44:40,662 --> 00:44:41,870
With death.

574
00:44:41,871 --> 00:44:44,828
Girl died in her father's arms.

575
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:47,662
Both of them covered in blood
and a knife at their feet.

576
00:44:50,163 --> 00:44:51,786
I'd say they were starving.

577
00:44:51,787 --> 00:44:53,703
And rather than let
his little girl suffer,

578
00:44:53,704 --> 00:44:55,661
he ended it for both of them.

579
00:44:55,662 --> 00:44:57,911
Doesn't matter now.

580
00:44:57,912 --> 00:45:00,704
No, doesn't matter now.

581
00:45:14,454 --> 00:45:16,870
I've known you a long time, Dondarrion.

582
00:45:16,871 --> 00:45:18,369
Aye.

583
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:22,453
I think the first time we
met was at that tournament...

584
00:45:22,454 --> 00:45:25,703
And I always thought
you were dull as dirt.

585
00:45:27,038 --> 00:45:28,786
You're not bad.

586
00:45:28,787 --> 00:45:30,162
I don't hate you.

587
00:45:30,163 --> 00:45:32,536
Don't like you, but you're not bad.

588
00:45:32,537 --> 00:45:34,369
Thank you, Clegane.

589
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:35,703
That warms the heart.

590
00:45:35,704 --> 00:45:38,369
But there's nothing special about you.

591
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:40,203
You're right about that.

592
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:43,662
So why does the Lord of
Light keep bringing you back?

593
00:45:44,954 --> 00:45:47,037
I've met better men than you,

594
00:45:47,038 --> 00:45:51,953
and they've been hanged
from crossbeams, or beheaded,

595
00:45:51,954 --> 00:45:56,828
or just shat themselves to
death in a field somewhere.

596
00:45:56,829 --> 00:45:59,911
None of them came back.

597
00:45:59,912 --> 00:46:01,494
So, why you?

598
00:46:01,495 --> 00:46:04,411
You think I don't ask myself that?

599
00:46:04,412 --> 00:46:07,578
Every hour of every day?

600
00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:09,246
Why am I here?

601
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,411
What am I supposed to do?

602
00:46:12,412 --> 00:46:14,204
What does the Lord see in me?

603
00:46:16,204 --> 00:46:17,537
And?

604
00:46:19,246 --> 00:46:21,911
I don't know.

605
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:23,911
I don't understand our Lord.

606
00:46:23,912 --> 00:46:25,745
Your Lord.

607
00:46:25,746 --> 00:46:27,536
I don't know what He wants from me.

608
00:46:27,537 --> 00:46:32,037
I only know that He wants me alive.

609
00:46:32,038 --> 00:46:34,805
If he's so all-powerful,
why doesn't he just tell you

610
00:46:34,806 --> 00:46:36,126
what the fuck he wants?

611
00:46:38,412 --> 00:46:40,203
Clegane.

612
00:46:40,204 --> 00:46:41,579
Come over here.

613
00:46:44,246 --> 00:46:45,954
Don't worry. The fire won't bite.

614
00:46:47,454 --> 00:46:50,245
I want to show you something.

615
00:46:50,246 --> 00:46:53,454
It's my fucking luck I end up
with a band of fire worshippers.

616
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,953
Aye.

617
00:46:55,954 --> 00:46:58,287
Almost seems like divine justice.

618
00:46:58,288 --> 00:47:00,828
There's no divine
justice, you dumb cunt.

619
00:47:00,829 --> 00:47:03,953
If there was, you'd be dead...

620
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:06,121
and that girl would be alive.

621
00:47:12,495 --> 00:47:15,328
- What do you want?
- Look into the flames.

622
00:47:15,329 --> 00:47:17,453
I don't want to look in the damn flames.

623
00:47:17,454 --> 00:47:20,996
You saw me bring him back from
the dead after you cut him down.

624
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,870
Don't you want to know
what gave me the power?

625
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:28,328
I keep asking and no
one wants to tell me.

626
00:47:28,329 --> 00:47:29,828
We can't tell you.

627
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:31,996
Only the fire can tell you.

628
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:46,038
What do you see?

629
00:47:47,787 --> 00:47:49,245
Logs burning.

630
00:47:49,246 --> 00:47:51,329
Keep looking.

631
00:47:56,996 --> 00:47:58,204
What do you see?

632
00:48:07,704 --> 00:48:10,411
Ice.

633
00:48:10,412 --> 00:48:12,329
A wall of ice.

634
00:48:14,746 --> 00:48:15,746
The Wall.

635
00:48:18,537 --> 00:48:19,786
What else?

636
00:48:19,787 --> 00:48:23,996
It's where the Wall meets the sea.

637
00:48:25,204 --> 00:48:27,412
There's a castle there.

638
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:36,328
There's a mountain.

639
00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:39,787
Looks like an arrowhead.

640
00:48:42,412 --> 00:48:44,579
The dead are marching past.

641
00:48:49,537 --> 00:48:51,370
Thousands of them.

642
00:48:57,495 --> 00:48:58,912
Do you believe me now, Clegane?

643
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:02,537
Do you believe we're here for a reason?

644
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:35,787
What the hell are you doing, Clegane?

645
00:49:39,204 --> 00:49:40,787
Burying the dead.

646
00:49:53,871 --> 00:49:55,995
You knew these people.

647
00:49:55,996 --> 00:49:57,495
Not really.

648
00:50:57,996 --> 00:51:01,828
We ask the Father to
judge us with mercy.

649
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:04,871
We ask the Mother to...

650
00:51:07,704 --> 00:51:09,871
Fuck it, I don't remember the rest.

651
00:51:16,412 --> 00:51:19,369
I'm sorry you're dead.

652
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:22,287
You deserved better.

653
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:23,288
Both of you.

654
00:51:47,246 --> 00:51:48,911
Hey.

655
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,494
Mom.

656
00:51:55,495 --> 00:51:57,246
You should really sleep, Sam.

657
00:51:58,704 --> 00:52:00,246
The dead don't.

658
00:52:09,454 --> 00:52:12,620
"Legends of the Long Night."

659
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:17,619
The Targaryens used dragonglass
to decorate their weapons

660
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:20,163
without even knowing what
the First Men used it for.

661
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:38,454
What is it?

662
00:52:40,246 --> 00:52:42,203
It's a map of Dragonstone.

663
00:52:42,204 --> 00:52:44,494
The Targaryens built their
first stronghold there

664
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,288
when they invaded Westeros.

665
00:52:48,996 --> 00:52:50,745
That's dragonglass?

666
00:52:50,746 --> 00:52:52,494
A mountain of it.

667
00:52:52,495 --> 00:52:53,661
Beneath the ground.

668
00:52:53,662 --> 00:52:55,995
Stannis told me, but I didn't think...

669
00:52:55,996 --> 00:52:59,495
This is important. Jon needs to know.

670
00:53:52,787 --> 00:53:54,870
Has she come yet?

671
00:53:54,871 --> 00:53:56,494
Who?

672
00:53:56,495 --> 00:53:58,703
The Dragon Queen.

673
00:53:58,704 --> 00:54:00,662
Daenerys Stormborn.

674
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:03,579
Haven't heard anything.

675
00:59:43,662 --> 00:59:44,824
Shall we begin?

676
