1
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:11,018
I wish you all the
happiness in the world.

2
00:00:13,977 --> 00:00:16,644
Myrcella?

3
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:18,811
Myrcella?

4
00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:33,018
Kill us!

5
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:43,976
I may have found a
way to treat Ser Jorah.

6
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,686
Please try not to scream.

7
00:00:49,352 --> 00:00:51,185
This is Brandon Stark.

8
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,185
Son of Ned Stark.

9
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:55,018
Let's get them inside.

10
00:00:56,227 --> 00:00:57,685
For decades, House Lannister

11
00:00:57,686 --> 00:00:59,394
has been the true power in Westeros,

12
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:02,434
and the seat of that
power is Casterly Rock.

13
00:01:02,435 --> 00:01:04,851
Grey Worm and the Unsullied
will sail for the Rock,

14
00:01:04,852 --> 00:01:05,893
and take it.

15
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:07,394
Summon Jon Snow.

16
00:01:07,686 --> 00:01:09,185
He would make a valuable ally.

17
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,892
Let him stand before you
and tell you the things

18
00:01:11,893 --> 00:01:12,935
that have happened to him.

19
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:16,185
Dragonstone sits on a
mountain of dragonglass.

20
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:20,018
We can never hope to defeat
the army of the dead alone.

21
00:01:20,227 --> 00:01:21,227
We need allies.

22
00:01:21,893 --> 00:01:25,059
You're abandoning your people!
You're abandoning your home.

23
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,727
Until I return, the North is yours.

24
00:03:11,486 --> 00:03:22,266
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

25
00:04:02,587 --> 00:04:04,305
The bastard of Winterfell.

26
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:07,477
The dwarf of Casterly Rock.

27
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:14,851
I believe we last saw
each other atop the Wall.

28
00:04:14,852 --> 00:04:18,768
You were pissing off the
edge if I remember right.

29
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,226
Picked up some scars along the road.

30
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:25,727
It's been a long road,
but we're both still here.

31
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:29,226
I'm Tyrion Lannister.

32
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:33,059
- Davos Seaworth.
- Ah, the Onion Knight.

33
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,142
We fought on opposite sides at
the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

34
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,726
Unluckily for me.

35
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:41,769
Missandei is the queen's
most trusted advisor.

36
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:45,142
Welcome to Dragonstone.

37
00:04:45,143 --> 00:04:46,976
Our queen knows it is a long journey.

38
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:50,351
She appreciates the efforts
you have made on her behalf.

39
00:04:50,352 --> 00:04:53,102
If you wouldn't mind
handing over your weapons.

40
00:04:58,727 --> 00:05:00,102
Of course.

41
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:26,269
Please, this way.

42
00:05:30,977 --> 00:05:32,601
Where are you from?

43
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:34,892
I can't place the accent.

44
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:36,726
I was born on the Island of Naath.

45
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:39,810
Ah. I hear it's beautiful down there.

46
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:41,892
Palm trees and butterflies.

47
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:43,310
Haven't been, myself.

48
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:49,269
This place has changed.

49
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:58,768
And Sansa? I hear she's alive and well.

50
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:01,269
- She is.
- Does she miss me terribly?

51
00:06:04,435 --> 00:06:06,851
A sham marriage. And unconsummated.

52
00:06:06,852 --> 00:06:10,017
- I didn't ask.
- Well, it was. Wasn't.

53
00:06:10,018 --> 00:06:11,934
Anyway...

54
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:14,768
she's much smarter than she lets on.

55
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:17,142
She's starting to let on.

56
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,060
Good.

57
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:20,101
At some point,

58
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:24,059
I want to hear how a Night's Watch
recruit became King in the North.

59
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,851
As long as you tell me how a Lannister

60
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,643
became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.

61
00:06:28,644 --> 00:06:30,768
A long and bloody tale.

62
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:33,519
To be honest, I was
drunk for most of it.

63
00:06:36,143 --> 00:06:38,685
My bannermen think I'm
a fool for coming here.

64
00:06:38,686 --> 00:06:40,101
Of course they do.

65
00:06:40,102 --> 00:06:42,811
If I was your Hand, I would
have advised against it.

66
00:06:45,435 --> 00:06:47,351
General rule of thumb...

67
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:50,476
Stark men don't fare well
when they travel south.

68
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,226
True...

69
00:06:52,227 --> 00:06:54,351
but I'm not a Stark.

70
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:09,852
I'd say you get used to them...

71
00:07:12,602 --> 00:07:14,060
but you never really do.

72
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:20,852
Come, their mother is waiting for you.

73
00:07:33,227 --> 00:07:36,810
I wondered why you weren't
there to meet our guests.

74
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:39,810
You begged us to summon
the King in the North.

75
00:07:39,811 --> 00:07:42,268
Don't you want to see him again?

76
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:44,892
I've done my part.

77
00:07:44,893 --> 00:07:47,309
I've brought ice and fire together.

78
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,601
Strange.

79
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,101
You spoke so highly of Jon Snow,

80
00:07:52,102 --> 00:07:55,768
but when he arrives,
you hide on a cliff.

81
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:58,142
I didn't take you for a bashful girl.

82
00:07:58,143 --> 00:08:02,351
My time whispering in the ears
of kings has come to an end.

83
00:08:02,352 --> 00:08:04,768
Oh, I doubt that.

84
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:07,393
Give us common folk one taste of power,

85
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:10,226
we're like the lion who tasted man.

86
00:08:10,227 --> 00:08:13,476
Nothing is ever so sweet again.

87
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:16,727
Neither of us is common folk anymore.

88
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:20,643
I did not part on good terms

89
00:08:20,644 --> 00:08:23,643
with the King in the
North or his advisor.

90
00:08:23,644 --> 00:08:24,644
Why?

91
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,352
Because of mistakes I made.

92
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,352
Terrible mistakes.

93
00:08:34,185 --> 00:08:37,309
I would only be a
distraction if I stayed.

94
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,518
- So, where will you go?
- Volantis.

95
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,518
Good.

96
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,768
If you don't mind my saying,

97
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:47,518
I don't think you should
return to Westeros.

98
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,977
I'm not sure you'd be safe here.

99
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:55,101
Oh, I will return, dear Spider.

100
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,892
- One last time.
- My lady...

101
00:08:56,893 --> 00:09:00,476
I have to die in this strange country.

102
00:09:00,477 --> 00:09:02,310
Just like you.

103
00:09:44,561 --> 00:09:46,184
You stand in the presence

104
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,976
of Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen,

105
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:51,184
rightful heir to the Iron Throne,

106
00:09:51,185 --> 00:09:54,142
rightful Queen of the
Andals and the First Men,

107
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:56,560
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms,

108
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:58,268
the Mother of Dragons,

109
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:00,476
the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,

110
00:10:00,477 --> 00:10:04,269
the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains.

111
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:11,060
This is Jon Snow.

112
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,852
He's King in the North.

113
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:21,726
Thank you for traveling so far, my lord.

114
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:23,976
I hope the seas weren't too rough.

115
00:10:23,977 --> 00:10:25,560
The winds were kind, Your Grace.

116
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:29,560
Apologies, I have a Flea
Bottom accent, I know,

117
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:32,434
but Jon Snow is King in
the North, Your Grace.

118
00:10:32,435 --> 00:10:34,268
- He's not a lord.
- Forgive me...

119
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:36,518
Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth.

120
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,434
Forgive me, Ser Davos.

121
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:41,059
I never did receive a formal education,

122
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,393
but I could have sworn I read

123
00:10:42,394 --> 00:10:45,685
the last King in the
North was Torrhen Stark,

124
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,851
who bent the knee to my
ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.

125
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:52,059
In exchange for his life and
the lives of the Northmen,

126
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,101
Torrhen Stark swore fealty to
House Targaryen in perpetuity.

127
00:10:57,102 --> 00:10:58,601
Or do I have my facts wrong?

128
00:10:58,602 --> 00:11:00,934
I wasn't there, Your Grace.

129
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:03,351
No, of course not.

130
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:05,934
But still, an oath is an oath.

131
00:11:05,935 --> 00:11:08,351
And perpetuity means...

132
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:10,810
what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?

133
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:12,309
Forever.

134
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,393
Forever.

135
00:11:14,394 --> 00:11:17,226
So I assume, my lord...

136
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:19,435
... you're here to bend the knee.

137
00:11:21,977 --> 00:11:23,519
I am not.

138
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,643
Oh.

139
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,477
Well, that is unfortunate.

140
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:31,476
You've traveled all this way

141
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:33,643
to break faith with House Targaryen?

142
00:11:33,644 --> 00:11:36,142
Break faith?

143
00:11:36,143 --> 00:11:38,476
Your father burned my grandfather alive.

144
00:11:38,477 --> 00:11:40,184
He burned my uncle alive.

145
00:11:40,185 --> 00:11:41,518
He would have burned
the Seven Kingdoms...

146
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,602
My father... was an evil man.

147
00:11:46,435 --> 00:11:48,644
On behalf of House Targaryen...

148
00:11:49,893 --> 00:11:51,518
I ask your forgiveness

149
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,476
for the crimes he committed
against your family.

150
00:11:54,477 --> 00:11:57,351
And I ask you not to judge a daughter

151
00:11:57,352 --> 00:11:59,727
by the sins of her father.

152
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:04,685
Our two houses were
allies for centuries,

153
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:06,560
and those were the best centuries

154
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:08,685
the Seven Kingdoms have ever known.

155
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,184
Centuries of peace and prosperity

156
00:12:11,185 --> 00:12:14,017
with a Targaryen sitting
on the Iron Throne

157
00:12:14,018 --> 00:12:18,017
and a Stark serving
as Warden of the North.

158
00:12:18,018 --> 00:12:21,768
I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.

159
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:24,184
Honor the pledge your
ancestor made to mine.

160
00:12:24,185 --> 00:12:27,851
Bend the knee and I will
name you Warden of the North.

161
00:12:27,852 --> 00:12:30,059
Together, we will save this country

162
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,686
from those who would destroy it.

163
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,560
You're right.

164
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:47,059
You're not guilty of
your father's crimes.

165
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,892
And I'm not beholden
to my ancestor's vows.

166
00:12:51,893 --> 00:12:53,892
Then why are you here?

167
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:56,727
Because I need your
help, and you need mine.

168
00:12:59,935 --> 00:13:01,892
Did you see three dragons

169
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:03,851
flying overhead when you arrived?

170
00:13:03,852 --> 00:13:04,934
I did.

171
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:07,226
And did you see the Dothraki,

172
00:13:07,227 --> 00:13:09,434
all of whom have sworn to kill for me?

173
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:11,393
They're hard to miss.

174
00:13:11,394 --> 00:13:15,434
- But still, I need your help?
- Not to defeat Cersei.

175
00:13:15,435 --> 00:13:18,768
You could storm King's Landing
tomorrow and the city would fall.

176
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:21,017
Hell, we almost took it and
we didn't even have dragons.

177
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:25,142
- Almost.
- But you haven't stormed King's Landing.

178
00:13:25,143 --> 00:13:26,768
Why not?

179
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:28,476
The only reason I can see

180
00:13:28,477 --> 00:13:30,726
is you don't want to kill
thousands of innocent people.

181
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,768
It's the fastest way to win the war,

182
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:34,601
but you won't do it,

183
00:13:34,602 --> 00:13:37,810
which means, at the very least,

184
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:39,269
you're better than Cersei.

185
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:44,143
Still, that doesn't explain
why I need your help.

186
00:13:46,018 --> 00:13:50,643
Because right now, you and I
and Cersei and everyone else,

187
00:13:50,644 --> 00:13:52,268
we're children playing at a game,

188
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,351
screaming that the rules aren't fair.

189
00:13:54,352 --> 00:13:56,476
- You told me you liked this man.
- I do.

190
00:13:56,477 --> 00:13:59,976
In the time since he's met me,
he's refused to call me queen,

191
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:02,851
he's refused to bow, and
now he's calling me a child.

192
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:06,643
I believe he's calling all of
us children. Figure of speech.

193
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:09,976
Your Grace, everyone you know
will die before winter's over

194
00:14:09,977 --> 00:14:12,142
if we don't defeat
the enemy to the north.

195
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,810
As far as I can see, you
are the enemy to the north.

196
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:16,477
I am not your enemy.

197
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:19,810
The dead are the enemy.

198
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:21,352
The dead?

199
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:24,226
Is that another figure of speech?

200
00:14:24,227 --> 00:14:25,851
The Army of the Dead is on the march.

201
00:14:25,852 --> 00:14:27,934
The Army of the Dead?

202
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:30,101
You don't know me well, my lord,

203
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,434
but do you think I'm a liar or a madman?

204
00:14:33,435 --> 00:14:35,976
No, I don't think you're
either of those things.

205
00:14:35,977 --> 00:14:38,101
The Army of the Dead is real.

206
00:14:38,102 --> 00:14:39,560
The white walkers are real.

207
00:14:39,561 --> 00:14:42,476
The Night King is real. I've seen them.

208
00:14:42,477 --> 00:14:44,017
If they get past the Wall

209
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:46,519
and we're squabbling
amongst ourselves...

210
00:14:49,561 --> 00:14:51,143
we're finished.

211
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:59,018
I was born at Dragonstone.

212
00:15:00,644 --> 00:15:03,351
Not that I can remember it.

213
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:06,810
We fled before Robert's
assassins could find us.

214
00:15:06,811 --> 00:15:10,017
Robert was your
father's best friend, no?

215
00:15:10,018 --> 00:15:13,851
I wonder if your father knew
his best friend sent assassins

216
00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:16,394
to murder a baby girl in her crib.

217
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:19,769
Not that it matters now, of course.

218
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,851
I spent my life in foreign lands.

219
00:15:24,852 --> 00:15:27,226
So many men have tried to kill me,

220
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:30,726
I don't remember all their names.

221
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:34,810
I have been sold like a broodmare.

222
00:15:34,811 --> 00:15:38,351
I've been chained and betrayed,

223
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:41,142
raped and defiled.

224
00:15:41,143 --> 00:15:43,393
Do you know what kept me standing

225
00:15:43,394 --> 00:15:46,351
through all those years in exile?

226
00:15:46,352 --> 00:15:49,309
Faith.

227
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,560
Not in any gods,

228
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:55,101
not in myths and legends.

229
00:15:55,102 --> 00:15:57,726
In myself.

230
00:15:57,727 --> 00:16:00,892
In Daenerys Targaryen.

231
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:04,434
The world hadn't seen
a dragon in centuries

232
00:16:04,435 --> 00:16:06,810
until my children were born.

233
00:16:06,811 --> 00:16:11,601
The Dothraki hadn't
crossed the sea, any sea.

234
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:13,976
They did for me.

235
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:18,434
I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms,

236
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,561
and I will.

237
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:25,434
You'll be ruling over a graveyard

238
00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:27,769
if we don't defeat the Night King.

239
00:16:29,185 --> 00:16:32,393
The war against my
sister has already begun.

240
00:16:32,394 --> 00:16:34,768
You can't expect us to halt hostilities

241
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:36,601
and join you in fighting

242
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:38,102
whatever you saw beyond the Wall.

243
00:16:40,977 --> 00:16:42,518
You don't believe him.

244
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:45,434
I understand that. It
sounds like nonsense.

245
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:49,226
But if destiny has brought Daenerys
Targaryen back to our shores,

246
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:52,434
it has also made Jon
Snow King in the North.

247
00:16:52,435 --> 00:16:55,560
You were the first to
bring Dothraki to Westeros?

248
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:58,934
He is the first to make allies
of wildlings and Northmen.

249
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,017
He was named Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

250
00:17:01,018 --> 00:17:02,101
He was named King in the North.

251
00:17:02,102 --> 00:17:03,476
Not because of his birthright.

252
00:17:03,477 --> 00:17:05,851
He has no birthright.
He's a damn bastard.

253
00:17:05,852 --> 00:17:10,892
All those hard sons of bitches
chose him as their leader

254
00:17:10,893 --> 00:17:12,602
because they believe in him.

255
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:15,976
All those things you don't believe in,

256
00:17:15,977 --> 00:17:17,518
he faced those things.

257
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,726
He fought those things
for the good of his people.

258
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:21,309
He risked his life for his people.

259
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,101
He took a knife in the
heart for his people.

260
00:17:23,102 --> 00:17:24,852
He gave his own...

261
00:17:31,018 --> 00:17:33,768
If we don't put aside our
enmities and band together,

262
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:35,851
we will die.

263
00:17:35,852 --> 00:17:39,518
And then it doesn't matter whose
skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.

264
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:41,851
If it doesn't matter, then
you might as well kneel.

265
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,017
Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys,

266
00:17:44,018 --> 00:17:45,643
help her to defeat my sister,

267
00:17:45,644 --> 00:17:47,810
and together, our armies
will protect the North.

268
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:49,560
There's no time for that.

269
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:51,476
There's no time for any of this!

270
00:17:51,477 --> 00:17:52,976
While we stand here, debating...

271
00:17:52,977 --> 00:17:54,934
It takes no time to bend the knee.

272
00:17:54,935 --> 00:17:56,768
Pledge your sword to her cause.

273
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:58,519
And why would I do that?

274
00:18:01,394 --> 00:18:03,518
I mean no offense, Your Grace,

275
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:04,726
but I don't know you.

276
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:06,560
As far as I can tell,

277
00:18:06,561 --> 00:18:09,851
your claim to the throne rests
entirely on your father's name,

278
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:13,185
and my own father fought
to overthrow the Mad King.

279
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:16,976
The lords of the North

280
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:19,810
placed their trust in me to lead them,

281
00:18:19,811 --> 00:18:23,852
and I will continue to
do so as well as I can.

282
00:18:25,102 --> 00:18:26,561
That's fair.

283
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,934
It's also fair to point out

284
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:34,059
that I'm the rightful
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

285
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,810
By declaring yourself king
of the northernmost kingdom,

286
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:39,726
you are in open rebellion.

287
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:52,017
Your Grace, please dismiss your guests.

288
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:54,102
I have grave news.

289
00:18:56,644 --> 00:18:58,518
You must forgive my manners.

290
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,892
You'll both be tired
after your long journey.

291
00:19:00,893 --> 00:19:03,644
We'll have baths drawn for you
and supper sent to your rooms.

292
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:14,435
Am I your prisoner?

293
00:19:18,435 --> 00:19:19,727
Not yet.

294
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:38,851
Our ironborn and Dornish allies

295
00:19:38,852 --> 00:19:40,309
were attacked en route to Dorne.

296
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,810
- And?
- Two or three ships escaped,

297
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:45,142
the rest, sunk or captured.

298
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,726
Ellaria and the Sand
Snakes, dead or captured.

299
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:50,309
The Greyjoys, dead or captured.

300
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,018
All of them?

301
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:57,142
- Pull!
- Heave!

302
00:19:57,143 --> 00:19:58,518
Pull!

303
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:10,227
Your sister's dead?

304
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:13,768
Euron has her.

305
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:15,143
You saw him take her?

306
00:20:17,435 --> 00:20:20,810
- But you got away?
- I couldn't save her.

307
00:20:20,811 --> 00:20:22,310
I tried.

308
00:20:23,602 --> 00:20:25,686
You wouldn't be here if you tried.

309
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:32,059
Come, men!

310
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,394
Sails up!

311
00:20:42,018 --> 00:20:44,018
Murderer!

312
00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:56,892
Whores!

313
00:20:56,893 --> 00:20:59,227
Traitor!

314
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,352
This is the life.

315
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:09,226
Look at them, cheering for a Greyjoy.

316
00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:15,142
I have to be honest,

317
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:17,102
this is making me hard.

318
00:21:20,102 --> 00:21:21,810
Did you see Little Theon's face

319
00:21:21,811 --> 00:21:24,184
right before he jumped overboard?

320
00:21:24,185 --> 00:21:26,726
"Oh, no!"

321
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:28,185
What a twat.

322
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:58,893
- Whore! Whore! Whore!
- Murderers!

323
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:35,518
My queen, please accept this gift

324
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,352
on behalf of all of your loyal
subjects in the Iron Islands.

325
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,518
I give you what no
other man could give...

326
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:50,643
justice.

327
00:22:50,644 --> 00:22:54,310
Justice for your murdered daughter.

328
00:23:03,852 --> 00:23:07,851
You've proven yourself the greatest
captain on the fourteen seas

329
00:23:07,852 --> 00:23:10,518
and a true friend to the crown.

330
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:13,726
You deserve more than a true friend.

331
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:17,226
And you deserve a proper
reward for your heroism.

332
00:23:17,227 --> 00:23:19,893
There's only one reward I want.

333
00:23:21,185 --> 00:23:23,893
You shall have what
your heart desires...

334
00:23:25,935 --> 00:23:27,477
when the war is won.

335
00:23:33,852 --> 00:23:37,309
With Euron Greyjoy
commanding our naval forces

336
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:40,476
and Jaime Lannister leading our armies,

337
00:23:40,477 --> 00:23:42,518
the sons and daughters of Westeros

338
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:44,810
shall defend our country.

339
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,059
There's nothing quite like it, is there?

340
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,810
The love of the people.

341
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:57,934
Though I suppose you wouldn't know.

342
00:23:57,935 --> 00:24:01,268
This same mob spat at
my sister not long ago.

343
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:03,017
And if you turn on us,

344
00:24:03,018 --> 00:24:06,226
they'll cheer to see your
head mounted on a spike.

345
00:24:06,227 --> 00:24:07,726
Or yours.

346
00:24:07,727 --> 00:24:10,851
They just like severed heads, really.

347
00:24:10,852 --> 00:24:14,101
Listen, if you have any advice at all,

348
00:24:14,102 --> 00:24:15,685
I would love to hear it.

349
00:24:15,686 --> 00:24:18,726
When we have an hour or
two to speak as brothers.

350
00:24:18,727 --> 00:24:20,434
Advice?

351
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:24,101
Does she like it gentle or rough?

352
00:24:24,102 --> 00:24:25,768
A finger in the bum?

353
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:29,060
Shh, shh, shh, shh, not
now. We'll talk later.

354
00:24:46,893 --> 00:24:49,851
I want you to know I understand.

355
00:24:49,852 --> 00:24:51,434
Even though we're enemies, you and I,

356
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:53,102
I understand the fury that drives you.

357
00:24:54,269 --> 00:24:55,601
I was there that day

358
00:24:55,602 --> 00:24:57,394
when Ser Gregor crushed
your lover's head.

359
00:24:59,935 --> 00:25:02,268
If I close my eyes,

360
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:05,268
I can hear the sound of
Oberyn's skull breaking.

361
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:07,476
The sound of your scream.

362
00:25:07,477 --> 00:25:08,976
I never heard a sound like that.

363
00:25:08,977 --> 00:25:10,935
I thought, "That's true love."

364
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:14,810
Oberyn looked beautiful
that day. He really did.

365
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:16,184
No one moved like him.

366
00:25:16,185 --> 00:25:19,309
No one had such skill with a spear.

367
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,393
Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him.

368
00:25:22,394 --> 00:25:24,851
If only he hadn't taunted him.

369
00:25:24,852 --> 00:25:28,810
He could've walked away and
left poor Ser Gregor to die.

370
00:25:28,811 --> 00:25:30,851
But that wasn't your
lover's way, was it?

371
00:25:30,852 --> 00:25:33,685
Now he's buried somewhere.

372
00:25:33,686 --> 00:25:36,434
And here's Ser Gregor,
stronger than ever.

373
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:38,352
That must be difficult for you.

374
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,309
When my daughter was taken from me,

375
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,434
my only daughter...

376
00:25:47,435 --> 00:25:50,226
well, you can't imagine how that feels

377
00:25:50,227 --> 00:25:52,476
unless you've lost a child.

378
00:25:52,477 --> 00:25:55,142
I fed her at my own breast
even though they told me

379
00:25:55,143 --> 00:25:57,851
to give her to the wet nurse.

380
00:25:57,852 --> 00:26:01,351
I couldn't bear to see her
in another woman's arms.

381
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:03,601
I never got to have a mother,

382
00:26:03,602 --> 00:26:05,017
but Myrcella did.

383
00:26:05,018 --> 00:26:08,685
She was mine, and you took her from me.

384
00:26:08,686 --> 00:26:10,727
Why did you do that?

385
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,686
Doesn't matter now.

386
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:30,017
Your daughter's a beauty, too.

387
00:26:30,018 --> 00:26:32,643
Those brown eyes.

388
00:26:32,644 --> 00:26:34,352
Those lips.

389
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:38,017
Perfect Dornish beauty.

390
00:26:38,018 --> 00:26:39,892
I imagine she's your favorite.

391
00:26:39,893 --> 00:26:43,059
I know, I know, we're not
supposed to have favorites,

392
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,227
but still, we're only human.

393
00:26:46,727 --> 00:26:48,309
We love whom we love.

394
00:26:51,185 --> 00:26:53,184
I'm sorry, I can't understand you.

395
00:26:53,185 --> 00:26:56,560
That gag makes it impossible to
understand what you're saying.

396
00:26:56,561 --> 00:26:58,394
It must be frustrating.

397
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:04,560
We all make our choices.

398
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:06,976
You chose to murder my daughter.

399
00:27:06,977 --> 00:27:09,226
You must have felt powerful
after you made that choice.

400
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,435
Do you feel powerful now?

401
00:27:18,018 --> 00:27:19,393
I don't sleep very well.

402
00:27:19,394 --> 00:27:21,768
Not at all, really.

403
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:23,685
I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy

404
00:27:23,686 --> 00:27:26,059
and imagine ways of killing my enemies.

405
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,935
How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the
woman who murdered my only daughter.

406
00:27:31,435 --> 00:27:33,101
I thought about having Ser Gregor

407
00:27:33,102 --> 00:27:35,268
crush your skull the
way he did Oberyn's.

408
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:39,976
It would be poetic, I
suppose, but fast, too fast.

409
00:27:39,977 --> 00:27:42,935
I thought about having him
crush your daughter's skull.

410
00:27:44,018 --> 00:27:45,769
She's so beautiful.

411
00:27:47,018 --> 00:27:48,685
The thought of this lovely face

412
00:27:48,686 --> 00:27:51,101
cracking open like a duck egg,

413
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:52,852
no, it's just not right.

414
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,434
Mama.

415
00:28:11,811 --> 00:28:14,142
Qyburn here is the cleverest man I know.

416
00:28:14,143 --> 00:28:17,226
Clever enough to learn what
poison you used to murder Myrcella.

417
00:28:17,227 --> 00:28:18,892
The Long Goodbye, was that it?

418
00:28:18,893 --> 00:28:20,977
- The Long Farewell.
- That's the one.

419
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,810
How long does the poison take?

420
00:28:26,811 --> 00:28:29,476
Difficult to say... hours, days.

421
00:28:29,477 --> 00:28:31,351
It depends on the
subject's constitution.

422
00:28:31,352 --> 00:28:34,852
- But death is certain?
- Oh, yes, Your Grace, quite certain.

423
00:28:40,227 --> 00:28:43,101
Your daughter will
die here in this cell,

424
00:28:43,102 --> 00:28:46,226
and you will be here
watching when she does.

425
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:49,018
You'll be here the rest of your days.

426
00:28:50,893 --> 00:28:54,851
If you refuse to eat, we'll
force food down your throat.

427
00:28:54,852 --> 00:28:58,560
You will live to watch
your daughter rot.

428
00:28:58,561 --> 00:29:01,851
To watch that beautiful face collapse...

429
00:29:01,852 --> 00:29:03,977
... to bone and dust.

430
00:29:06,352 --> 00:29:09,310
All the while contemplating
the choices you've made.

431
00:29:12,394 --> 00:29:15,017
Make sure the guards change
the torches every few hours.

432
00:29:15,018 --> 00:29:16,435
I don't want her to miss a thing.

433
00:29:47,435 --> 00:29:48,686
No.

434
00:30:30,935 --> 00:30:31,935
Don't.

435
00:30:43,977 --> 00:30:46,810
What are you doing? No
one can see us like this.

436
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:50,477
I am the Queen of the Seven
Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.

437
00:30:56,018 --> 00:30:57,142
Forgive me, Your Grace.

438
00:30:57,143 --> 00:30:59,476
The visitor from Braavos has arrived.

439
00:30:59,477 --> 00:31:02,476
Good. And we'll need
fresh sheets for the bed.

440
00:31:02,477 --> 00:31:03,811
At once, Your Grace.

441
00:31:14,686 --> 00:31:17,059
No, thank you.

442
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,768
My condolences, Your Grace,

443
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:20,726
on the death of your son.

444
00:31:20,727 --> 00:31:23,434
From all reports, he
was a fine young man.

445
00:31:23,435 --> 00:31:26,184
The Iron Bank didn't send
you here to offer condolences.

446
00:31:26,185 --> 00:31:29,685
Condolences and congratulations.

447
00:31:29,686 --> 00:31:32,643
To become the first ruling
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,

448
00:31:32,644 --> 00:31:34,643
that's quite an accomplishment.

449
00:31:34,644 --> 00:31:38,434
The Iron Bank appreciates how you
cast off the yoke of superstition,

450
00:31:38,435 --> 00:31:40,017
freeing the crown from elements

451
00:31:40,018 --> 00:31:42,518
who sought to subvert the rule of law.

452
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:45,685
The destruction of the Sept of
Baelor was a tragic accident.

453
00:31:45,686 --> 00:31:49,892
Indeed, but sometimes
tragedies are necessary

454
00:31:49,893 --> 00:31:52,268
to restore order and
rational leadership.

455
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:55,017
The Iron Bank wants its gold back.

456
00:31:55,018 --> 00:31:57,601
Your father never minced words either.

457
00:31:57,602 --> 00:32:01,434
But, yes, your debts are considerable.

458
00:32:01,435 --> 00:32:04,309
And you're now engaged in a
conflict on several fronts.

459
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,226
We both know how expensive war can be.

460
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:09,434
And we both know gold wins wars.

461
00:32:09,435 --> 00:32:10,892
Your vaults are empty.

462
00:32:10,893 --> 00:32:13,393
Your late husband's
profligacy saw to that.

463
00:32:13,394 --> 00:32:16,726
Your wealthiest allies, the
Tyrells, are now your enemies.

464
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:20,309
You are surrounded on all
sides by rivals for the throne.

465
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,268
And the Iron Bank wants
to bet on a winner.

466
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:23,976
We don't make bets.

467
00:32:23,977 --> 00:32:27,560
We invest in endeavors we
deem likely to be successful.

468
00:32:27,561 --> 00:32:30,518
A fancy way of saying "bet."

469
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:34,268
The war's already begun.
I've drawn first blood.

470
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:37,268
I decapitated the Dornish snake.

471
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:39,309
My armada owns the Narrow Sea.

472
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,768
Euron Greyjoy's armada
owns the Narrow Sea.

473
00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:43,268
Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.

474
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:45,476
For now.

475
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:49,226
Daenerys Targaryen has
three full-grown dragons.

476
00:32:49,227 --> 00:32:53,560
How well do wooden ships fare
against fire-breathing dragons?

477
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:58,601
Her dragons might not be as
invulnerable as some think.

478
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,976
But let's talk about the Targaryen girl.

479
00:33:00,977 --> 00:33:02,892
You want to invest in her?

480
00:33:02,893 --> 00:33:07,268
I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested
considerable gold in the slave trade.

481
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:09,518
How are your profits

482
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,059
now that Daenerys has
freed all the slaves?

483
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:16,226
The slave trade has entered
a downturn, it's true.

484
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:18,101
From what I gather,
she considers herself

485
00:33:18,102 --> 00:33:21,434
more of a revolutionary than a monarch.

486
00:33:21,435 --> 00:33:25,351
In your experience, how do bankers
usually fare with revolutionaries?

487
00:33:25,352 --> 00:33:28,351
The Lannisters owe the Iron
Bank quite a lot of money,

488
00:33:28,352 --> 00:33:30,518
but Lannisters always pay their debts.

489
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:34,935
Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?

490
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,518
Your father's daughter, indeed.

491
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,851
Give me a fortnight.

492
00:33:41,852 --> 00:33:44,059
Stay in King's Landing
as my honored guest.

493
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,476
And when you return to Braavos,

494
00:33:45,477 --> 00:33:49,935
I swear to you, my debt
will be paid in full.

495
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:17,394
I came down here to brood over my
failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.

496
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:21,476
You're making it difficult.

497
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:25,143
You look a lot better
brooding than I do.

498
00:34:26,852 --> 00:34:29,393
You make me feel like I'm
failing at brooding over failing.

499
00:34:29,394 --> 00:34:31,101
I'm a prisoner on this island.

500
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:35,059
I wouldn't say you're a
prisoner on this island.

501
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,560
You're free to walk the castle,

502
00:34:36,561 --> 00:34:38,476
the beaches, to go wherever you want.

503
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:40,643
Except to my ship.

504
00:34:40,644 --> 00:34:42,059
You took my ship.

505
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,017
I wouldn't say we took your ship.

506
00:34:44,018 --> 00:34:46,518
I'm not playing word games with you.

507
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,393
The dead are coming for us all.

508
00:34:48,394 --> 00:34:50,059
Why don't you figure out what to do

509
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,142
about my missing fleet
and murdered allies,

510
00:34:52,143 --> 00:34:55,017
and I'll figure out what to
do about your walking dead men.

511
00:34:55,018 --> 00:34:57,226
It's hard for me to
fathom. It really is.

512
00:34:57,227 --> 00:35:00,352
If someone told me about the
white walkers and the Night King...

513
00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:09,018
You probably don't believe me.

514
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:13,643
I do, actually.

515
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,185
You didn't before.

516
00:35:16,893 --> 00:35:19,101
"Grumkins and snarks," you called them.

517
00:35:19,102 --> 00:35:21,184
Do you remember?

518
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:23,268
You said it was all nonsense.

519
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:26,393
It was nonsense. Everybody knew it.

520
00:35:26,394 --> 00:35:29,518
But then Mormont saw them

521
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:30,934
and you saw them.

522
00:35:30,935 --> 00:35:32,601
And I trust the eyes of an honest man

523
00:35:32,602 --> 00:35:34,602
more than I trust what everybody knows.

524
00:35:35,935 --> 00:35:38,184
How do I convince
people who don't know me

525
00:35:38,185 --> 00:35:40,934
that an enemy they don't believe
in is coming to kill them all?

526
00:35:40,935 --> 00:35:44,268
- Good question.
- I know it's a good question.

527
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:46,434
I'm looking for an answer.

528
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:50,726
People's minds aren't made
for problems that large.

529
00:35:50,727 --> 00:35:53,184
White walkers, the Night King,

530
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:55,268
Army of the Dead...

531
00:35:55,269 --> 00:35:56,892
it's almost a relief to confront

532
00:35:56,893 --> 00:35:59,769
a comfortable, familiar
monster like my sister.

533
00:36:02,102 --> 00:36:05,060
I need to help prepare my
people for what's coming.

534
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:09,102
I can't help them from here.

535
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:11,852
I'd like to leave.

536
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,810
It seems unlikely that you
became King in the North

537
00:36:15,811 --> 00:36:17,477
by giving up that easily.

538
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,768
Everyone told me to learn
from my father's mistakes.

539
00:36:22,769 --> 00:36:24,560
Don't go south.

540
00:36:24,561 --> 00:36:27,226
Don't answer a summons from
the Mad King's daughter,

541
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,644
a foreign invader.

542
00:36:31,018 --> 00:36:33,726
And here I am,

543
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:35,268
a Northern fool.

544
00:36:35,269 --> 00:36:37,726
Children are not their fathers,

545
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:39,435
luckily for all of us.

546
00:36:40,935 --> 00:36:43,142
And sometimes there's
more to foreign invaders

547
00:36:43,143 --> 00:36:45,351
and Northern fools than meets the eye.

548
00:36:45,352 --> 00:36:49,560
Daenerys could have sailed for
Westeros long ago, but she didn't.

549
00:36:49,561 --> 00:36:51,393
Instead, she stayed where she was

550
00:36:51,394 --> 00:36:54,059
and saved many people
from horrible fates,

551
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,393
some of whom are on this
island with us right now.

552
00:36:56,394 --> 00:36:57,976
While you're our guest here,

553
00:36:57,977 --> 00:36:59,518
you might consider asking them

554
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,268
what they think of the
Mad King's daughter.

555
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:05,351
She protects people from monsters,

556
00:37:05,352 --> 00:37:06,892
just as you do.

557
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:09,351
It's why she came here.

558
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,892
And she's not about to head north

559
00:37:10,893 --> 00:37:12,351
to fight an enemy she's never seen

560
00:37:12,352 --> 00:37:14,851
on the word of a man she doesn't know.

561
00:37:14,852 --> 00:37:17,268
After a single meeting,

562
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:20,060
it's not a reasonable thing to ask.

563
00:37:26,435 --> 00:37:28,686
So, do you have anything
reasonable to ask?

564
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:34,685
What do you mean?

565
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:36,934
Maybe you are a Northern fool.

566
00:37:36,935 --> 00:37:40,602
I'm asking if there's
something I can do to help you.

567
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,101
- Dragonglass?
- Yes.

568
00:37:45,102 --> 00:37:47,560
Volcanic glass, obsidian.

569
00:37:47,561 --> 00:37:49,560
He says you have a
tremendous amount of it here.

570
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:51,351
Why are we talking about glass?

571
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,226
We just lost two of our allies.

572
00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:56,602
Which is why I was speaking
to Jon Snow, a potential ally.

573
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:02,726
And what does the King in the
North want with dragonglass?

574
00:38:02,727 --> 00:38:05,059
Apparently, it can
be turned into weapons

575
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:08,184
that kill white walkers
and their foot soldiers.

576
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:10,351
Or stop them.

577
00:38:10,352 --> 00:38:11,643
Destroy them.

578
00:38:11,644 --> 00:38:13,269
Unsure about the nomenclature.

579
00:38:15,227 --> 00:38:18,184
And what do you think
about this Army of the Dead

580
00:38:18,185 --> 00:38:21,059
and white walkers and Night Kings?

581
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,685
I'd very much like to believe
that Jon Snow is wrong.

582
00:38:23,686 --> 00:38:26,934
But a wise man once said that
you should never believe a thing

583
00:38:26,935 --> 00:38:29,477
simply because you want to believe it.

584
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:35,351
Which wise man said this?

585
00:38:35,352 --> 00:38:37,226
I don't remember.

586
00:38:37,227 --> 00:38:40,644
Are you trying to present your
own statements as ancient wisdom?

587
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,059
I would never do that.

588
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,102
To you.

589
00:38:46,935 --> 00:38:50,601
The reason I believe Jon
Snow is because he's here.

590
00:38:50,602 --> 00:38:53,017
All of his advisors would
have told him not to come.

591
00:38:53,018 --> 00:38:55,101
I would have told him not to come.

592
00:38:55,102 --> 00:38:57,434
And he's here anyway.

593
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,851
You don't have to believe him.

594
00:38:59,852 --> 00:39:01,892
Let him mine the dragonglass.

595
00:39:01,893 --> 00:39:03,518
If he's wrong, it's worthless.

596
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:05,601
You didn't even know it was here.

597
00:39:05,602 --> 00:39:08,142
It's nothing to you.

598
00:39:08,143 --> 00:39:11,434
Give him something
by giving him nothing.

599
00:39:11,435 --> 00:39:14,142
Take a step toward a more
productive relationship

600
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,726
with a possible ally.

601
00:39:16,727 --> 00:39:20,101
Keep him occupied while we
focus on the task at hand...

602
00:39:20,102 --> 00:39:21,477
Casterly Rock.

603
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,518
What was that Ser Davos said

604
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:28,560
about taking a knife in
the heart for his people?

605
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:30,351
Did you notice that?

606
00:39:30,352 --> 00:39:32,810
You must allow them
their flights of fancy.

607
00:39:32,811 --> 00:39:34,977
It's dreary in the North.

608
00:39:50,852 --> 00:39:52,352
Amazing thing to see.

609
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:56,893
I named them for my
brothers, Viserys and Rhaegar.

610
00:39:58,018 --> 00:39:59,519
They're both gone now.

611
00:40:01,811 --> 00:40:03,185
You lost two brothers as well.

612
00:40:06,352 --> 00:40:09,227
People thought dragons were
gone forever, but here they are.

613
00:40:10,977 --> 00:40:13,811
Perhaps we should all be
examining what we think we know.

614
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:22,059
You've been talking to Tyrion.

615
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,810
He is my Hand.

616
00:40:24,811 --> 00:40:27,435
- He enjoys talking.
- We all enjoy what we're good at.

617
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,394
I don't.

618
00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:38,393
You know I'm not going to let
Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.

619
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,560
I never expected that you would.

620
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:40,810
And I haven't changed my mind

621
00:40:40,811 --> 00:40:42,892
about which kingdoms
belong to that throne.

622
00:40:42,893 --> 00:40:44,727
I haven't either.

623
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:58,268
I will allow you to mine the
dragonglass and forge weapons from it.

624
00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:01,269
Any resources or men you
need, I will provide for you.

625
00:41:04,769 --> 00:41:05,769
Thank you.

626
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:15,935
So you believe me, then, about the
Night King and the Army of the Dead?

627
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:21,811
You'd better get to work, Jon Snow.

628
00:41:46,477 --> 00:41:48,101
How much do we have?

629
00:41:48,102 --> 00:41:50,184
4,000 bushels, my lady.

630
00:41:50,185 --> 00:41:51,351
What does that mean?

631
00:41:51,352 --> 00:41:53,434
For the current occupants of the castle,

632
00:41:53,435 --> 00:41:57,101
it's enough food for
a year, perhaps more.

633
00:41:57,102 --> 00:42:00,518
And what's the longest winter
in the past hundred years?

634
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,976
Uh, I'm not entirely certain.

635
00:42:02,977 --> 00:42:04,810
I-I'll check Maester Luwin's records.

636
00:42:04,811 --> 00:42:08,309
He kept a copy of every raven scroll.

637
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:10,434
You're telling me we
don't have enough food,

638
00:42:10,435 --> 00:42:13,644
especially not if the armies of the
North come back to defend Winterfell?

639
00:42:14,893 --> 00:42:17,142
No, my lady, most likely not.

640
00:42:17,143 --> 00:42:19,268
Then we must prepare
for that eventuality.

641
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:21,351
Whatever direction
the threat comes from,

642
00:42:21,352 --> 00:42:23,643
this is the best place to be.

643
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:25,601
We need to start building
up our grain stores

644
00:42:25,602 --> 00:42:28,184
with regular shipments from
every keep in the North.

645
00:42:28,185 --> 00:42:30,476
If we don't use it by winter's
end, we'll give it back to them.

646
00:42:30,477 --> 00:42:32,810
But if the entire North
has to flee to Winterfell,

647
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:36,518
they won't have enough time to
bring wagonloads of grain with them.

648
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:37,934
Very wise, my lady.

649
00:42:37,935 --> 00:42:39,727
Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?

650
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,017
Are they covering those
breastplates in leather?

651
00:42:46,018 --> 00:42:47,393
No, my lady.

652
00:42:47,394 --> 00:42:50,476
Well, shouldn't they be?
Once the real cold comes?

653
00:42:50,477 --> 00:42:51,892
They should, indeed.

654
00:42:51,893 --> 00:42:54,101
Pardon me, my lady.

655
00:42:54,102 --> 00:42:56,686
You there, why isn't
there leather on these?

656
00:42:58,686 --> 00:43:00,477
Command suits you.

657
00:43:02,185 --> 00:43:04,268
The Northerners are all facing north,

658
00:43:04,269 --> 00:43:06,351
worried about the threat
from beyond the Wall.

659
00:43:06,352 --> 00:43:07,892
So they should be.

660
00:43:07,893 --> 00:43:10,560
I know Cersei better than anyone here.

661
00:43:10,561 --> 00:43:12,643
If you turn your back on her...

662
00:43:12,644 --> 00:43:15,212
You don't know Cersei
better than anyone here.

663
00:43:15,772 --> 00:43:17,042
I only meant to say...

664
00:43:17,162 --> 00:43:20,101
That the woman who murdered my mother,
father, and brother is dangerous?

665
00:43:20,102 --> 00:43:22,185
Thank you for your wise counsel.

666
00:43:23,477 --> 00:43:25,685
One of two things will happen...

667
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,976
either the dead will defeat the living,

668
00:43:27,977 --> 00:43:29,934
in which case...

669
00:43:29,935 --> 00:43:32,017
all our troubles come to an end,

670
00:43:32,018 --> 00:43:34,393
or life will win out.

671
00:43:34,394 --> 00:43:36,393
And what then?

672
00:43:36,394 --> 00:43:40,394
Don't fight in the North or the South.

673
00:43:41,977 --> 00:43:46,852
Fight every battle, everywhere,
always, in your mind.

674
00:43:48,769 --> 00:43:50,643
Everyone is your enemy,

675
00:43:50,644 --> 00:43:53,560
everyone is your friend...

676
00:43:53,561 --> 00:43:57,685
every possible series of
events is happening all at once.

677
00:43:57,686 --> 00:44:01,268
Live that way and
nothing will surprise you.

678
00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:03,851
Everything that happens
will be something

679
00:44:03,852 --> 00:44:05,769
that you've seen before.

680
00:44:08,018 --> 00:44:10,769
Lady Sansa, at the gate.

681
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,477
Hello, Sansa.

682
00:45:05,352 --> 00:45:07,476
I wish Jon were here.

683
00:45:07,477 --> 00:45:10,352
Yes, I need to speak to him.

684
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:17,143
You're Father's last
living trueborn son.

685
00:45:18,977 --> 00:45:21,851
You're Lord of Winterfell now.

686
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:25,101
I can never be Lord of Winterfell.

687
00:45:25,102 --> 00:45:26,934
I can never be lord of anything.

688
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:28,185
I'm the Three-Eyed Raven.

689
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,059
I don't know what that means.

690
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,476
It's difficult to explain.

691
00:45:34,477 --> 00:45:36,686
Try. Please, for me.

692
00:45:38,394 --> 00:45:41,351
It means I can see everything.

693
00:45:41,352 --> 00:45:43,685
Everything that's ever
happened to everyone.

694
00:45:43,686 --> 00:45:46,685
Everything that's happening right now.

695
00:45:46,686 --> 00:45:51,476
It's all pieces now, fragments.

696
00:45:51,477 --> 00:45:53,685
I need to learn to see better.

697
00:45:53,686 --> 00:45:57,101
When the Long Night comes again,

698
00:45:57,102 --> 00:45:58,727
I need to be ready.

699
00:46:01,769 --> 00:46:04,184
How do you know all this?

700
00:46:04,185 --> 00:46:05,726
The Three-Eyed Raven taught me.

701
00:46:05,727 --> 00:46:07,643
I thought you were
the Three-Eyed Raven.

702
00:46:07,644 --> 00:46:10,393
I told you it's difficult to explain.

703
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,059
Bran...

704
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,434
I'm sorry for all
that's happened to you.

705
00:46:16,435 --> 00:46:20,435
I'm sorry it had to
happen here in our home.

706
00:46:25,644 --> 00:46:27,727
It was so beautiful that night.

707
00:46:29,727 --> 00:46:33,727
Snow falling, just like now.

708
00:46:36,977 --> 00:46:38,811
And you were so beautiful...

709
00:46:40,769 --> 00:46:42,561
in your white wedding dress.

710
00:46:46,435 --> 00:46:48,310
I have to go back inside, Bran.

711
00:46:49,686 --> 00:46:51,394
I'll stay a bit longer.

712
00:47:05,102 --> 00:47:06,644
Hmm.

713
00:47:15,143 --> 00:47:16,977
Hmm.

714
00:47:22,435 --> 00:47:24,309
Does it hurt?

715
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:27,018
A bit. Less than before.

716
00:47:28,811 --> 00:47:31,434
The infection no longer
appears to be active.

717
00:47:33,018 --> 00:47:34,851
Unusual.

718
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,309
Unlikely.

719
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:38,309
One could almost be forgiven

720
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:41,892
for thinking that the entire upper
layer of diseased skin was debrided

721
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:46,268
and the underlying region
treated with some sort of unguent.

722
00:47:46,269 --> 00:47:49,560
Don't know anything about that.

723
00:47:49,561 --> 00:47:51,643
I just started feeling better.

724
00:47:51,644 --> 00:47:55,310
I assumed it was the rest that did it.

725
00:47:57,269 --> 00:47:59,892
And the climate.

726
00:47:59,893 --> 00:48:01,851
The climate.

727
00:48:01,852 --> 00:48:03,643
You're free to go, ser.

728
00:48:03,644 --> 00:48:05,685
This chamber is needed
for the infectious,

729
00:48:05,686 --> 00:48:07,393
which you are no longer.

730
00:48:07,394 --> 00:48:10,893
Tarly, I'd like to speak with
you in my study this evening.

731
00:48:13,852 --> 00:48:15,143
How bad is it?

732
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:18,185
Suppose I'll find out this evening.

733
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:26,017
Where will you go?

734
00:48:26,018 --> 00:48:29,727
I surrendered to this sickness
the moment I first saw it.

735
00:48:31,185 --> 00:48:34,017
I knew it would kill me

736
00:48:34,018 --> 00:48:36,685
or I'd kill myself before it could.

737
00:48:36,686 --> 00:48:39,934
Daenerys Stormborn
convinced me otherwise.

738
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:43,560
The only place for me is back with her.

739
00:48:43,561 --> 00:48:45,976
I owe her my life.

740
00:48:45,977 --> 00:48:48,560
Her and you.

741
00:48:50,769 --> 00:48:53,101
Your father saved me more than once.

742
00:48:53,102 --> 00:48:54,893
It's the least I could do.

743
00:48:56,394 --> 00:48:59,768
Perhaps our paths will cross again.

744
00:48:59,769 --> 00:49:01,185
I hope they do.

745
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:31,768
- You treated him?
- Yes.

746
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:34,268
Who told you to treat him?

747
00:49:34,269 --> 00:49:35,601
No one.

748
00:49:35,602 --> 00:49:38,892
Who forbade you, or anyone,
to attempt to treat him?

749
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,601
I seem to remember you.

750
00:49:41,602 --> 00:49:44,435
- But you treated him anyway?
- I did, yes.

751
00:49:46,102 --> 00:49:49,226
I forbade it because it is
dangerous and rarely successful,

752
00:49:49,227 --> 00:49:51,560
especially on someone of that age.

753
00:49:51,561 --> 00:49:53,768
You could have infected
yourself and others.

754
00:49:53,769 --> 00:49:57,227
You could have devastated
the entire Citadel.

755
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:01,434
But you didn't.

756
00:50:01,435 --> 00:50:04,059
It's a meticulous, difficult procedure.

757
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:07,476
Many maesters whose chains
are heavy with healing links

758
00:50:07,477 --> 00:50:09,934
have attempted it and failed.

759
00:50:09,935 --> 00:50:12,017
Yet you succeeded.

760
00:50:12,018 --> 00:50:13,143
How?

761
00:50:15,143 --> 00:50:18,435
I read the books and
followed the instructions.

762
00:50:28,811 --> 00:50:31,018
That man is alive because of you.

763
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:34,935
You should be proud.

764
00:50:38,018 --> 00:50:40,518
Thank you, Archmaester.

765
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:41,519
Come here.

766
00:50:45,477 --> 00:50:49,142
All these manuscripts and
scrolls are rotting away.

767
00:50:49,143 --> 00:50:51,811
I need you to make copies of them.

768
00:50:56,102 --> 00:50:58,185
You were expecting a reward.

769
00:50:59,893 --> 00:51:03,686
Your reward is not being immediately
expelled from the Citadel.

770
00:51:04,852 --> 00:51:06,851
You'd better get started.

771
00:51:06,852 --> 00:51:08,518
And careful of the paper mites.

772
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:09,852
They like flesh as well.

773
00:51:17,102 --> 00:51:20,476
We need to find Euron
Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.

774
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:23,976
Your Grace, he's already destroyed
a good portion of our fleet.

775
00:51:23,977 --> 00:51:25,518
To send our remaining ships after him...

776
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:28,185
I'm not talking about
sending our ships after him.

777
00:51:32,018 --> 00:51:33,560
Would you have to go yourself?

778
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:35,560
Euron's ships could be anywhere

779
00:51:35,561 --> 00:51:37,560
or in more than one place.

780
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,976
You'd be flying around
the open seas alone

781
00:51:39,977 --> 00:51:41,017
for who knows how long.

782
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:42,643
I wouldn't be alone.

783
00:51:42,644 --> 00:51:45,226
I would have Drogon,
Viserion, and Rhaegal.

784
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,017
What can anyone do to them?

785
00:51:47,018 --> 00:51:49,017
They can still do something to you.

786
00:51:49,018 --> 00:51:50,810
It only takes one arrow.

787
00:51:50,811 --> 00:51:53,352
It's too great a risk.
You're too important.

788
00:51:55,686 --> 00:51:57,810
What about Casterly Rock?

789
00:51:57,811 --> 00:51:59,768
The Unsullied will be there soon.

790
00:51:59,769 --> 00:52:02,351
And what will they face?

791
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:04,768
A difficult situation.

792
00:52:04,769 --> 00:52:06,892
They know we're coming.

793
00:52:06,893 --> 00:52:10,226
Yes. Cersei believes
my sole purpose in life

794
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:11,851
is to destroy House Lannister.

795
00:52:11,852 --> 00:52:13,602
She will be ready.

796
00:52:17,602 --> 00:52:20,226
- No one has ever taken the Rock.
- Archers!

797
00:52:20,227 --> 00:52:22,601
The Lannister Army is still
the army my father built.

798
00:52:22,602 --> 00:52:24,934
- Come on!
- Well-trained and well-provisioned.

799
00:52:24,935 --> 00:52:26,726
10,000 men at least.

800
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:27,727
They will see us coming.

801
00:52:32,269 --> 00:52:33,934
They will be ready.

802
00:52:37,227 --> 00:52:39,269
- Draw! Loose!
- Loose!

803
00:52:41,477 --> 00:52:44,602
The gates of Casterly
Rock are impregnable.

804
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:54,560
The fight up the walls will be hard.

805
00:52:54,561 --> 00:52:56,102
We will be at a disadvantage.

806
00:52:57,477 --> 00:52:59,143
Many men will die.

807
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:03,352
Just as my father said they would.

808
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:08,142
Interesting thing about my father...

809
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:10,059
he built our house up from near ruin.

810
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:14,226
He built our army, he built
Casterly Rock as we know it,

811
00:53:14,227 --> 00:53:16,309
but he didn't build the sewers.

812
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,393
That was beneath him,

813
00:53:18,394 --> 00:53:21,268
so he gave the job to the
lowest person he could find...

814
00:53:21,269 --> 00:53:22,810
me.

815
00:53:22,811 --> 00:53:24,643
He was right, I was low.

816
00:53:24,644 --> 00:53:26,768
The company I kept, low.

817
00:53:26,769 --> 00:53:28,309
Women, mostly.

818
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:29,976
They weren't welcome at the Rock.

819
00:53:29,977 --> 00:53:32,268
Father disapproved of
that sort of behavior.

820
00:53:32,269 --> 00:53:33,892
Couldn't walk them
through the front gates,

821
00:53:33,893 --> 00:53:35,351
I couldn't have them in my chambers,

822
00:53:35,352 --> 00:53:37,601
so in the process of
building the sewers,

823
00:53:37,602 --> 00:53:40,352
I threw in something for myself.

824
00:53:42,394 --> 00:53:44,393
It was a passage that began

825
00:53:44,394 --> 00:53:46,101
in an out of the way cove by the sea

826
00:53:46,102 --> 00:53:49,518
and ended beneath one
of the main guard towers.

827
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:52,727
No better place for low
pursuits than beneath the ground.

828
00:53:54,352 --> 00:53:58,101
Casterly Rock is an
impregnable fortress.

829
00:54:00,352 --> 00:54:04,017
But as a good friend of mine once said,

830
00:54:04,018 --> 00:54:07,976
"Give me 10 good men and
I'll impregnate the bitch."

831
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:14,727
And so it begins.

832
00:54:21,477 --> 00:54:24,351
They will face the bulk
of the Lannister forces.

833
00:54:24,352 --> 00:54:26,226
They will be outnumbered.

834
00:54:26,227 --> 00:54:28,561
They will have less
armor and fewer weapons.

835
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:37,309
But my sister's armies
fight for her out of fear.

836
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:40,268
The Unsullied will be
fighting for something greater.

837
00:54:40,269 --> 00:54:42,268
They will be fighting for freedom

838
00:54:42,269 --> 00:54:44,059
and the person who gave it to them.

839
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,560
They will be fighting for you.

840
00:54:46,561 --> 00:54:49,018
And that is why they will triumph.

841
00:55:05,018 --> 00:55:06,769
_

842
00:55:08,227 --> 00:55:10,435
_

843
00:55:11,621 --> 00:55:13,240
_

844
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:36,976
Where are they?!

845
00:55:36,977 --> 00:55:39,602
Where are the rest of the Lannisters?

846
00:57:08,477 --> 00:57:10,727
- It's done.
- It is.

847
00:57:12,602 --> 00:57:16,727
And now the rains weep o'er our halls.

848
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,518
Did we fight well?

849
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:23,560
Uh, as well as could be expected.

850
00:57:23,561 --> 00:57:25,685
It was never our forte.

851
00:57:25,686 --> 00:57:27,769
Golden roses, indeed.

852
00:57:29,686 --> 00:57:31,726
Your brother and his new queen

853
00:57:31,727 --> 00:57:34,643
thought you would be
defending Casterly Rock.

854
00:57:34,644 --> 00:57:37,934
The truth is Casterly Rock
isn't worth much anymore.

855
00:57:37,935 --> 00:57:39,518
Well, it is to me,

856
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:41,851
but my fond childhood memories

857
00:57:41,852 --> 00:57:43,393
won't keep Cersei on the throne.

858
00:57:43,394 --> 00:57:45,518
So you just let them take it?

859
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:47,560
For now. They won't be able to hold it.

860
00:57:47,561 --> 00:57:50,101
Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships,

861
00:57:50,102 --> 00:57:52,101
we emptied the larders before we left.

862
00:57:52,102 --> 00:57:54,351
Eventually, they'll be forced
to abandon their position

863
00:57:54,352 --> 00:57:57,768
and march all the way across Westeros.

864
00:57:57,769 --> 00:58:00,934
And you took your army, your real army,

865
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:02,810
and went where they weren't.

866
00:58:02,811 --> 00:58:06,142
As Robb Stark did to
me at Whispering Wood.

867
00:58:06,143 --> 00:58:08,184
There are always lessons in failures.

868
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:11,769
Yes. You must be very wise by now.

869
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:15,934
My father always said
I was a slow learner.

870
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,685
If he was so clever,

871
00:58:17,686 --> 00:58:19,434
why didn't he take Highgarden

872
00:58:19,435 --> 00:58:23,142
the moment your gold mines ran dry?

873
00:58:24,686 --> 00:58:28,601
I suppose I'll be able to
ask him myself soon enough.

874
00:58:28,602 --> 00:58:31,686
No more learning from my mistakes, eh?

875
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:36,643
How will you do it?

876
00:58:36,644 --> 00:58:39,101
With that sword?

877
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:41,476
That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?

878
00:58:41,477 --> 00:58:43,810
Not that he ever used it.

879
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:45,477
What did he call it?

880
00:58:47,102 --> 00:58:49,434
Widow's Wail.

881
00:58:49,435 --> 00:58:51,644
He really was a cunt, wasn't he?

882
00:58:53,269 --> 00:58:58,643
I did unspeakable things
to protect my family.

883
00:58:58,644 --> 00:59:02,685
Or watched them being done on my orders.

884
00:59:02,686 --> 00:59:05,851
I never lost a night's sleep over them.

885
00:59:05,852 --> 00:59:07,892
They were necessary.

886
00:59:07,893 --> 00:59:09,934
And whatever I imagined necessary

887
00:59:09,935 --> 00:59:13,851
for the safety of House Tyrell, I did.

888
00:59:13,852 --> 00:59:18,477
But your sister has done things...

889
00:59:20,143 --> 00:59:22,476
I was incapable of imagining.

890
00:59:22,477 --> 00:59:25,309
That was my prize mistake...

891
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,852
a failure of imagination.

892
00:59:29,185 --> 00:59:31,643
She's a monster, you do know that?

893
00:59:31,644 --> 00:59:33,810
To you, I'm sure.

894
00:59:33,811 --> 00:59:35,685
To others as well.

895
00:59:35,686 --> 00:59:39,184
But after we've won and there's
no one left to oppose us,

896
00:59:39,185 --> 00:59:43,518
when people are living
peacefully in the world she built,

897
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:47,227
do you really think they'll wring
their hands over the way she built it?

898
00:59:49,644 --> 00:59:51,851
You love her.

899
00:59:51,852 --> 00:59:53,643
You really do love her.

900
00:59:53,644 --> 00:59:56,101
You poor fool.

901
00:59:56,102 --> 00:59:57,851
She'll be the end of you.

902
00:59:57,852 --> 01:00:00,393
Possibly.

903
01:00:00,394 --> 01:00:02,184
Not much to be gained

904
01:00:02,185 --> 01:00:04,226
from discussing it with
you, though, is there?

905
01:00:04,227 --> 01:00:06,934
What better person to discuss it with?

906
01:00:06,935 --> 01:00:08,851
What better guarantee could you have

907
01:00:08,852 --> 01:00:12,892
that the things you say
will never leave this room?

908
01:00:12,893 --> 01:00:15,934
But perhaps you're right.

909
01:00:15,935 --> 01:00:17,518
If she's driven you this far,

910
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:19,935
it's gone beyond your control.

911
01:00:21,227 --> 01:00:23,226
Yes.

912
01:00:23,227 --> 01:00:24,686
It has.

913
01:00:25,769 --> 01:00:27,810
She's a disease.

914
01:00:27,811 --> 01:00:30,768
I regret my role in spreading it.

915
01:00:30,769 --> 01:00:32,351
You will, too.

916
01:00:32,352 --> 01:00:34,102
I think we're done here.

917
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:38,561
How will it happen?

918
01:00:40,102 --> 01:00:42,017
Cersei had several ideas.

919
01:00:42,018 --> 01:00:43,434
Whipping you through the streets

920
01:00:43,435 --> 01:00:46,101
and beheading you in
front of the Red Keep.

921
01:00:46,102 --> 01:00:49,935
Flaying you alive and hanging you
from the walls of King's Landing.

922
01:00:53,102 --> 01:00:54,893
I talked her out of those.

923
01:01:12,143 --> 01:01:13,560
Will there be pain?

924
01:01:13,561 --> 01:01:16,142
No. I made sure of that.

925
01:01:16,143 --> 01:01:17,477
That's good.

926
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:32,269
I'd hate to die like your son.

927
01:01:33,477 --> 01:01:34,934
Clawing at my neck,

928
01:01:34,935 --> 01:01:37,810
foam and bile spilling from my mouth,

929
01:01:37,811 --> 01:01:41,643
eyes bloodred, skin purple.

930
01:01:41,644 --> 01:01:44,017
Must have been horrible for you,

931
01:01:44,018 --> 01:01:47,476
as a Kingsguard, as a father.

932
01:01:47,477 --> 01:01:50,059
It was horrible enough for me.

933
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:52,726
A shocking scene.

934
01:01:52,727 --> 01:01:55,519
Not at all what I intended.

935
01:01:57,477 --> 01:02:02,060
You see, I had never seen
the poison work before.

936
01:02:07,018 --> 01:02:09,184
Tell Cersei.

937
01:02:09,185 --> 01:02:11,644
I want her to know it was me.
