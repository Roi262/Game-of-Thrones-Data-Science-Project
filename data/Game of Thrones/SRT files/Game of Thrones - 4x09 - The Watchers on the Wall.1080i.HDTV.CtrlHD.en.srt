1
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:11,984
What was she like?

2
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:16,321
She...

3
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,626
she had red hair.

4
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:24,296
Oh?

5
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,748
- How big were her feet?
- What do you want me to say?

6
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:30,135
I want you to tell me what
it was like to have someone.

7
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,137
To be with someone.

8
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,972
To love someone and have
them love you back.

9
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:41,396
We're all gonna die a lot
sooner than I'd planned.

10
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:45,067
You're the closest
I'll ever get to knowing.

11
00:04:48,604 --> 00:04:50,221
So you and Gilly never?

12
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,556
No.

13
00:04:51,574 --> 00:04:53,859
She just had a baby.

14
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,063
And she never offered.

15
00:04:58,081 --> 00:05:00,532
But if she had,

16
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,234
you would have?

17
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:06,038
You'd have broken
your vows?

18
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,044
The interesting
thing is,

19
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:15,130
our vows never
specifically forbid

20
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,182
intimate relations
with women.

21
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,850
What?

22
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:22,304
"I shall take no wife," yes, that's
in there. There's no denying that.

23
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,773
"I shall father no children."
It's very specific.

24
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:27,592
But what do our vows
have to say about other...

25
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,779
activities is open
to interpretation.

26
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:36,234
I don't think Ser Alliser
cares much for interpretation.

27
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:43,742
Anyway, there's nothing
for him to interpret.

28
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,744
We didn't.

29
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:51,133
So what's it like?

30
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,720
It's...

31
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:59,758
there's this person,
this whole other person.

32
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:03,178
And you're wrapped up in them
and they're wrapped up in you.

33
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,397
And you--

34
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,432
for a little--

35
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,768
for a little while,
you're more than just you.

36
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:13,071
You're-- I don't know.
I'm not a bleeding poet.

37
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,990
No, you're really not.

38
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:16,908
What did I get for it?

39
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,861
An arrow six inches
from my heart.

40
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:23,982
There'll be arrows for all
of us soon, I imagine.

41
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,617
There will.

42
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,954
They've already done the worst
thing to me they could ever do.

43
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,825
Go get some sleep, Sam.

44
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:36,094
I'll take this watch.

45
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,723
Did I ever
tell you about her?

46
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:24,843
- My Sheila?
- Yes.

47
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,212
That was a night
to remember.

48
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,682
Of course, I'd had
a good bit to drink.

49
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:33,902
Her fangs were sharp,

50
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:36,154
but she knew
how to use them.

51
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,941
And she was nice
and soft down below.

52
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,577
No, she was no
ordinary beast.

53
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:44,496
Many is the man who--

54
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,615
I know you never
fucked a bear.

55
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,417
You know you never
fucked a bear.

56
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:52,737
Right now I don't want to think
about the bear you never fucked.

57
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:55,874
Right now all I want
to think about

58
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,677
is each one of these arrows finding
its way into a crow's heart.

59
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,264
We could be waiting
here a while.

60
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:03,632
Good.

61
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,684
The longer we wait,
the more arrows I'll have.

62
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,275
They came up here
to our land

63
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:15,861
and put up a big wall
and said it was theirs.

64
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,280
Then they started
hunting us down.

65
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,618
This time, we're the ones
doing the hunting.

66
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:28,123
You've got a lot
to say about killing.

67
00:08:28,157 --> 00:08:30,242
Even more words
than arrows.

68
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,779
Back in those villages, I killed
just as many of them as you did.

69
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:36,798
More, I reckon.

70
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:40,919
Yes, but none of those
were your crow lover.

71
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,721
I probably killed
him already.

72
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,172
<i>So you've said.</i>

73
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,391
And if not,

74
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:50,095
the only thing left of him is gonna be
his fun bits hanging around my neck.

75
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,963
<i>More words.</i>

76
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:54,316
Know what I think
you do when you see him?

77
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,186
Serve him up a nice juicy
slice of ginger minge.

78
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,576
You been thinking
about that ginger minge?

79
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,446
Wondering what
it tastes like?

80
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,418
Maybe I have.

81
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,954
Jon Snow is mine.

82
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,874
Anyone else
tries to kill him,

83
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,677
I'll have
an arrow for them.

84
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:29,134
And not one of your bald friends
is fast enough to stop me.

85
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:55,126
And what is it that couldn't
wait until morning, Tarly?

86
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,295
Maester Aemon.

87
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,864
- How did you know--
- That it was you?

88
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:02,467
Who else
but Samwell Tarly

89
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,386
would be wasting candles

90
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,055
to read in the middle
of the night?

91
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,178
- Let me help you.
- Oh, no need.

92
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,564
I know my way
around this library

93
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:19,184
better than any other
place in Castle Black.

94
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,519
Thousands of books

95
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:23,855
and no eyes to read them.

96
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:27,909
Old age is a wonderful
source of ironies

97
00:10:27,943 --> 00:10:30,111
if nothing else.

98
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,664
But you didn't
answer my question.

99
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,282
What are you reading?

100
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,701
Maester Faull.

101
00:10:36,735 --> 00:10:39,704
Ah, the wildlings.

102
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:43,291
I can assure you that
the closest Maester Faull

103
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:46,711
ever got to a wildling
was this very library.

104
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:49,681
But what he says
about what they do,

105
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,182
it's all true.

106
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,919
It's exactly what the survivors
of their raids report.

107
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:59,774
Yes, imagine the stories
wildlings tell about us.

108
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,229
Love is the death
of duty.

109
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:07,982
I told that to your friend
Jon Snow once.

110
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:12,270
He didn't listen
and neither did you.

111
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:16,274
Which is why you've abandoned
your watch atop the Wall

112
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:20,245
to come here and read
about the terrible things

113
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,416
that may have happened
to the girl you love.

114
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,452
I don't love her.

115
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,421
- Yes, you do.
- No.

116
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,139
Yes, you do.

117
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:35,343
Heard it in your voice when
you first brought her to me.

118
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,595
I remember how it sounds.

119
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:39,630
I was in love once.

120
00:11:39,648 --> 00:11:40,932
You were?

121
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:45,270
You can imagine
all manner of horrors

122
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,972
befalling that poor
girl and her child.

123
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,742
Is it so difficult
to imagine

124
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,660
that an old person
was once,

125
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:54,863
more or less,
like you?

126
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,532
I'm sorry, Maester.

127
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,317
I didn't mean it
like that.

128
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:03,221
Do you know who I was
before I came here?

129
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:07,292
What I could have been
if I'd only said the word?

130
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:10,628
Of course you do.

131
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:14,382
I met many girls
when I was Aemon Targaryen.

132
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,303
A future king
always does.

133
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,940
Some of them
were quite forward

134
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,642
in their attempts
to win my affections.

135
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:28,113
One of them succeeded.

136
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,032
I was very young.

137
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:33,685
Who was she?

138
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,653
Ah.

139
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:38,239
I could tell you
everything about her.

140
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,158
Who she was,

141
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,960
how we met,

142
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,129
the color of her eyes,

143
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,898
and the shape
of her nose.

144
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,969
I can see her

145
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,838
right in front of me.

146
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:59,260
She's more real
than you are.

147
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:06,717
We could spend all night
trading tales of lost loves.

148
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:09,554
Nothing makes the past
a sweeter place to visit

149
00:13:09,572 --> 00:13:12,724
than the prospect
of imminent death.

150
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,076
Go to bed, Tarly.

151
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,668
<i>Sorry, I can't open the gate</i>
<i>for anybody. Orders.</i>

152
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,954
<i>- You don't understand.</i>
<i>- They killed everyone.</i>

153
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,072
<i>Everyone but me</i>
<i>and my baby.</i>

154
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,458
<i>They're out there.</i>
<i>I saw them on my way here.</i>

155
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,710
<i>They may have seen me. They
may have followed me. Please.</i>

156
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:34,179
<i>I'm sorry, I can't.</i>

157
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,580
<i>If they find us out here,</i>
<i>you don't know...</i>

158
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:37,415
Pyp!
Open the gate.

159
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:40,134
- I can't.
- Sam, is that you?

160
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,303
Yes.

161
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,389
Thorne gave me strict
orders to not open the gate.

162
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,025
Oh, Pyp,
open the fucking gate!

163
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:50,094
I never heard you
curse before.

164
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:52,197
Yes, well,
best get used to it.

165
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,121
Are you all right?

166
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,659
Shh, you're all right.

167
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,613
Of course you are,
my brave little fella.

168
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:11,299
- It was horrible.
- I'm so, so sorry.

169
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,134
I didn't know
until I got back.

170
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:14,636
Don't let them
send me away, Sam.

171
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,554
- Never. - I know there's
no women allowed.

172
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,058
Anyone who tries to throw you out
will be having words with me.

173
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:23,094
From now on,
wherever you go,

174
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,597
I go, too.

175
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:37,525
<i>Get ready!</i>

176
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,744
- <i>Man the gate!</i>
- <i>Ready yourselves!</i>

177
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,829
<i>Make haste!</i>

178
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:43,981
- <i>Prepare!</i>
- <i>Up on the Wall!</i>

179
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:45,533
<i>Quickly!</i>
<i>Up! Up!</i>

180
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,786
- <i> How many?</i>
<i>- How many are there?</i>

181
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,957
Beyond the trees!

182
00:14:56,828 --> 00:14:58,930
It's time.

183
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,596
Light them up!
Light them all!

184
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,024
Move!

185
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,028
Pick up the pace!

186
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:06,080
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

187
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:15,340
Here we go, boys,
there's one.

188
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,543
Let's go.
There's two.

189
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,631
Let's get the next load.

190
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,053
That's the last
of the oil, Ser Alliser.

191
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,191
100,000 you say?

192
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,393
Yes, Ser.

193
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,729
You can say it
if you like.

194
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:41,616
We should have sealed the
tunnel while we had the chance,

195
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,036
like you suggested.

196
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,289
It was a difficult
decision either way, Ser.

197
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:54,111
Do you know what leadership
means, Lord Snow?

198
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:57,215
It means that the person in
charge gets second-guessed

199
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,834
by every clever little
twat with a mouth.

200
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,286
But if he starts
second-guessing himself,

201
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:04,121
that's the end--

202
00:17:04,139 --> 00:17:07,592
for him, for the
clever little twats,

203
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,310
for everyone.

204
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:12,313
This is not the end.
Not for us.

205
00:17:12,347 --> 00:17:14,482
Not if you lot
do your duty

206
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:17,068
for however long it takes
to beat them back.

207
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,773
And then you get
to go on hating me

208
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,441
and I get
to go on wishing

209
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,943
your wildling whore
had finished the job.

210
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,768
<i>You'll be safe</i>
<i>down here.</i>

211
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,687
I'll check on you
as soon as I can.

212
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:55,640
You're leaving me again?

213
00:17:56,725 --> 00:17:58,359
I'm not leaving you.

214
00:17:58,393 --> 00:18:01,178
You're going up there and we're
staying down here. That's leaving.

215
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:03,564
You said from now on
we'd stay together.

216
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,617
I didn't mean
in the same room.

217
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,985
What are you going
to do out there?

218
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:09,370
- Help my brothers.
- How?

219
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,040
You're going to fight the
free folk when they come?

220
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:15,910
They'll kill you. In Mole's
Town, they killed everyone.

221
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:19,547
I can't just hide here with you
while they're fighting out there.

222
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:22,416
Why not? You won't
matter up there.

223
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,085
You will down here.

224
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,372
I am a man of
the Night's Watch, Gilly.

225
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,675
I made a promise
to defend the Wall

226
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,543
and I have to keep it

227
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:35,146
because that's
what men do.

228
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,027
Promise me
you won't die.

229
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:56,200
I promise you
I won't die.

230
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:33,437
There's a lot more wildlings on the
other side of the Wall than this side.

231
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:36,574
We've got loads
of weapons and things.

232
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,492
It's the perfect place
for us to be.

233
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,745
I've never thrown
a spear before.

234
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,631
I've never held a sword
with a proper edge.

235
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:46,334
This is no place
for me to be.

236
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:49,720
You're not afraid?

237
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,223
Of course I'm afraid.

238
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,759
There's a band of wildlings
coming to kill us.

239
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,227
If you're afraid
of a band of wildlings,

240
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,513
how in seven hells did you
manage to kill a white walker?

241
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:07,655
I didn't know
I was going to kill it.

242
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:10,441
But I had to do something.
I didn't have any choice.

243
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,443
It was going to kill Gilly
and take the baby.

244
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,748
If someone had asked
me my name right then,

245
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,450
I wouldn't have known.

246
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:24,171
I wasn't
Samwell Tarly anymore.

247
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:26,958
I wasn't a steward
in the Night's Watch

248
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,710
or son of Randyll Tarly
or any of that.

249
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,047
I was nothing at all.

250
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,884
And when you're
nothing at all,

251
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,553
there's no more reason
to be afraid.

252
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:43,357
But you're afraid now?

253
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:45,860
Yes, well...

254
00:20:47,729 --> 00:20:49,814
I'm not nothing anymore.

255
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:10,501
Most of their men
are up top.

256
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,871
Didn't count more than 20 down here.
Leftovers.

257
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:15,973
They got a big fat one and a
little bony one manning the front.

258
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,508
How high are the walls?

259
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,810
Well, we'll be up and over before
they know what's happened.

260
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:24,265
Let's kill some crows!

261
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:28,653
Come on!

262
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,788
<i>Come on, brothers!</i>

263
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,582
Archers nock.

264
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,817
Everyone else hold.

265
00:23:06,835 --> 00:23:09,286
Grenn, no!

266
00:23:12,207 --> 00:23:15,159
I said nock and hold,
you cunts!

267
00:23:15,177 --> 00:23:18,212
- Does nock mean draw?
- No, Ser!

268
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:21,515
- Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?
- No, Ser!

269
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,769
- You all plan to die here tonight?
- No, Ser!

270
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,271
That's very good to hear.
Draw!

271
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:33,561
No, down below!

272
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:45,706
Draw!
Light them up.

273
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,873
Come on, get up!

274
00:24:02,891 --> 00:24:04,725
They're attacking
the southern gate!

275
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:06,894
<i>- Now?</i>
- Now.

276
00:24:10,232 --> 00:24:13,984
I'm going down there. Brother
Slynt, you have the Wall.

277
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,553
What?

278
00:24:16,571 --> 00:24:19,773
What are you fucking waiting for?
Loose!

279
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:23,277
You heard the man.
Loose!

280
00:25:00,448 --> 00:25:01,982
You, over there.

281
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,039
- Did you get one?
- No.

282
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,710
Ah, shit, Pyp!
Shit.

283
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,378
- Sam.
- Yeah?

284
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,213
- I think
we're gonna die.

285
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,249
If you keep
missing, we will.

286
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,227
Come on!
Come on!

287
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,600
Brothers!

288
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:40,187
100 generations
have defended this castle.

289
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,990
She's never fallen before.

290
00:25:43,024 --> 00:25:44,474
She will not fall tonight.

291
00:25:44,492 --> 00:25:47,644
Those are Thenns
at our walls.

292
00:25:47,662 --> 00:25:49,980
They eat the flesh
of the men they kill.

293
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:53,167
Do you want to fill
the belly of a Thenn tonight?

294
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:54,501
No!

295
00:25:54,536 --> 00:25:56,036
Tonight we fight.

296
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,488
<i>And when the sun rises,</i>
<i>I promise you,</i>

297
00:25:58,506 --> 00:26:00,424
Castle Black will stand!

298
00:26:01,543 --> 00:26:03,761
The Night's Watch
will stand.

299
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:10,601
With me now!
Now with me!

300
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,276
No discipline.
No training.

301
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:12,112
Gang of thieves,
that's all this is.

302
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,915
<i>I commanded the City Watch</i>
<i>of King's Landing.</i>

303
00:27:14,949 --> 00:27:16,834
<i>Those men obeyed orders.</i>

304
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,669
We can't just let
them attack the gate!

305
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:22,039
The bars of those gates are four
inches of cold-rolled steel.

306
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:24,541
Those are giants riding
mammoths down there!

307
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:27,044
Do you think your cold-rolled
steel is gonna stop them?

308
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,345
No such thing
as giants.

309
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,048
<i>A story</i>
<i>for the children.</i>

310
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:34,852
Brother Slynt.

311
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,688
We just got word that Ser
Alliser needs you below.

312
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:42,726
You're the most experienced man
he's got, Ser, and he needs you.

313
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:45,429
Needed below?

314
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:47,614
Yes. Yes.

315
00:27:56,791 --> 00:28:00,294
Archers, nock your arrows!

316
00:28:00,328 --> 00:28:02,830
<i>Nock arrows!</i>

317
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,581
Draw!

318
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,218
Loose!

319
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,301
They won't summit
before dawn.

320
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,352
How do you know that?

321
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,471
Because I've made
that climb.

322
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:30,607
I think they're in a bigger
hurry than you were.

323
00:28:33,328 --> 00:28:35,195
<i>Hold the bridge!</i>

324
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:37,364
<i>Hold, wait for it!</i>

325
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:40,250
<i>Come on with the rocks!</i>

326
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:47,341
Nock!

327
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,711
Draw!

328
00:28:54,382 --> 00:28:55,682
Loose!

329
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,653
Down!

330
00:29:50,772 --> 00:29:53,273
No! No!

331
00:30:12,293 --> 00:30:13,877
To the gate.
Come on, let's move.

332
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:19,216
It's gonna open.

333
00:31:23,998 --> 00:31:26,366
I got one right through the heart.
He's dead.

334
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,818
- Oh, is it over?
- No.

335
00:31:28,836 --> 00:31:30,704
Well, then...

336
00:31:38,212 --> 00:31:41,298
You're all right.
You're all right.

337
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,769
I'll get help.

338
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:47,521
Shh. Shh.

339
00:31:47,555 --> 00:31:49,856
Maester Aemon is coming.

340
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:51,841
He's gonna make
it all right.

341
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:55,145
Shh. Shh.

342
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,956
- Now.
- Now!

343
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,751
The outer gate
won't hold.

344
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:43,720
Take five men,
hold the inner gate.

345
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,138
Aye.

346
00:33:47,642 --> 00:33:49,476
Hold the gate.

347
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,812
If they make it through...

348
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,982
They won't.

349
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:00,687
Come on, Hill.
And you, Cooper.

350
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:03,907
- You three, on me.

351
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,243
Come on,
you lazy bastards.

352
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:12,115
Oil.

353
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,252
Oil on the ramp!

354
00:34:24,378 --> 00:34:26,630
Protect the gate!

355
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,548
Get him inside.

356
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,754
Hold the fucking gate!

357
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,923
Hold it!

358
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,933
We need more men
down here.

359
00:36:09,952 --> 00:36:12,452
- We have to hold the gate.
- But we need men here.

360
00:36:12,486 --> 00:36:14,771
Tell Jon.
He's in command.

361
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:17,207
Let's go.

362
00:36:24,832 --> 00:36:28,001
Get me to the top!
You hear me?!

363
00:36:32,506 --> 00:36:34,925
Your name's Olly, right?

364
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:38,178
Listen to me, Olly.
Get me to the top.

365
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:41,231
And when we give the signal,
bring us back down.

366
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,984
You hear me?

367
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:51,241
Find a weapon, Olly.
Fight them.

368
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:26,176
Clear the way!
Let's go!

369
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,311
- Out of the way!
- Get out of here!

370
00:37:45,746 --> 00:37:48,197
Cut the rope!

371
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,840
Wait! No!

372
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,906
- <i>We need more archers.</i>
- <i>Here I am.</i>

373
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,275
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>Quickly.</i>

374
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,412
What are you
doing up here?

375
00:38:19,447 --> 00:38:21,948
The wildlings
are over the walls.

376
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,783
Ser Alliser's fallen.

377
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:26,503
The castle won't stand
much longer.

378
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:31,174
Edd, you have the Wall.

379
00:38:33,427 --> 00:38:35,912
If they try the mammoths
again, drop fire on them.

380
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,715
If the climbers get too high,
drop the scythe on them.

381
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:47,423
Come, brothers.
Now fight with me!

382
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:51,277
Might as well enjoy
our last night, right, boys?

383
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,279
Light the fuckers up!

384
00:38:53,314 --> 00:38:56,483
<i>Nock! Draw!</i>

385
00:38:57,434 --> 00:38:59,652
Loose!

386
00:39:08,278 --> 00:39:09,412
How are we
gonna stop that?

387
00:39:09,446 --> 00:39:10,747
Shot 20 arrows
in him already.

388
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,215
You heard Jon.
We hold the gate.

389
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:13,666
Jon Snow's not
Lord Commander.

390
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,385
We hold the gate!

391
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,763
Mother, save me.
Father, save me.

392
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:27,981
The gods aren't down here.

393
00:39:28,015 --> 00:39:29,649
It's the six of us.
You hear me?

394
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,307
Night gathers
and now my watch begins.

395
00:39:38,325 --> 00:39:40,744
<i>It shall not end</i>
<i>until my death.</i>

396
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:43,246
I shall take no wife,
hold no lands,

397
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,864
<i>father no children.</i>

398
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:47,450
I shall wear no crown
and win no glory.

399
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:49,669
I shall live and die
at my post.

400
00:39:49,703 --> 00:39:51,588
I am the sword
in the darkness.

401
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:53,423
I am the watcher
on the walls.

402
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:56,459
I am the shield that guards
the realms of men.

403
00:39:56,493 --> 00:40:00,513
I pledge my life and honor
to the Night's Watch

404
00:40:00,548 --> 00:40:03,216
for this night
and all the nights to come!

405
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:10,440
I don't want you
out there.

406
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,692
You can't
protect me forever.

407
00:40:12,726 --> 00:40:15,311
There won't be anywhere
to hide if the castle falls.

408
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:20,700
I need him
more than I need you.

409
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,726
We need you, boy.

410
00:41:58,832 --> 00:42:00,550
Ha!

411
00:43:55,616 --> 00:43:57,166
Jon Snow.

412
00:43:57,201 --> 00:44:00,453
Hush.
Don't talk.

413
00:44:04,574 --> 00:44:07,043
Do you remember the cave?

414
00:44:11,465 --> 00:44:14,267
We should have
stayed in the cave.

415
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,223
We'll go back there.

416
00:44:26,313 --> 00:44:29,649
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.

417
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:07,320
Drop the scythe, boys!

418
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:31,994
- Hoist her up.
<i>- Hoist her up!</i>

419
00:45:37,885 --> 00:45:40,002
They've had enough
for one night.

420
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,476
Don't cheer too loud.

421
00:45:47,861 --> 00:45:50,897
They still outnumber us
1,000 to one.

422
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:00,957
Tormund.

423
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:03,543
It's over.

424
00:46:03,577 --> 00:46:04,911
Let it end.

425
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:07,246
This is how a man ends.

426
00:46:15,222 --> 00:46:16,756
Put him in chains.

427
00:46:17,874 --> 00:46:19,675
We'll question him later.

428
00:46:22,396 --> 00:46:24,814
I should have
thrown you

429
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:27,850
from the top
of the Wall, boy!

430
00:46:27,884 --> 00:46:29,902
Aye.

431
00:46:29,937 --> 00:46:31,988
You should have.

432
00:46:39,112 --> 00:46:41,781
Whoa, it's me.
It's me.

433
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:47,453
I promised you,
didn't I?

434
00:47:02,436 --> 00:47:04,136
We held them off.

435
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:06,138
For one night.

436
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,524
This is a great
victory.

437
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,726
A great victory?

438
00:47:12,279 --> 00:47:14,530
Mance was testing
our defenses.

439
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,148
He almost
made it through.

440
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,985
And he has more giants.
He has more mammoths.

441
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,737
He has 1,000 times
as many men.

442
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:27,660
They'll hit us
again tonight.

443
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:30,129
Maybe we can hold them
off for a day or two,

444
00:47:30,163 --> 00:47:31,914
but we'll never
beat them.

445
00:47:33,133 --> 00:47:34,500
Where are we going?

446
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,219
Going to find Mance.

447
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:38,955
To fi---
you can't do that.

448
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,840
<i>No one gave you</i>
<i>any orders.</i>

449
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:44,977
Who's left
to give orders?

450
00:47:45,012 --> 00:47:47,763
The wildling army's only
an army because of Mance.

451
00:47:47,797 --> 00:47:50,516
He united
100 warring tribes.

452
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,602
Without Mance,
they lose their leader.

453
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:55,321
They lose their purpose. They
go back to fighting each other.

454
00:47:55,355 --> 00:47:57,156
Scatter back
to their homes.

455
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:59,358
Without Mance?

456
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:00,826
You're going to kill him?

457
00:48:00,861 --> 00:48:02,161
I'm gonna try.

458
00:48:02,195 --> 00:48:04,030
They'll never let you
within 100 yards of him.

459
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,282
And even if they did, even
if you managed to kill him--

460
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,868
They'll kill me? If I don't
go, they'll kill me anyway.

461
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:10,336
They'll kill
the rest of us, too.

462
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:12,922
<i>They won't just kill you.</i>

463
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:14,823
They'll boil you.
They'll flay you.

464
00:48:14,841 --> 00:48:16,342
They'll make it last days.

465
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:22,682
You're right.
It's a bad plan.

466
00:48:24,685 --> 00:48:26,719
What's your plan?

467
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,181
They held the gate.

468
00:49:21,408 --> 00:49:23,993
Get some brothers
down here to help you.

469
00:49:26,113 --> 00:49:28,414
We need to burn
the bodies.

470
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:52,254
Raise the outer gate.

471
00:49:52,272 --> 00:49:54,807
Then lower it again
as soon as I'm out.

472
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,737
What are you doing?

473
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:10,456
I promised Mormont
I'd never lose it again.

474
00:50:14,795 --> 00:50:16,962
In case I don't come back.

475
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:26,806
Jon.

476
00:50:31,478 --> 00:50:33,262
Come back.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
