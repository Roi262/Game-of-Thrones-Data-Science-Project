Your Grace, if you'd like
to sit, I'm sure that--

6
00:02:49,722 --> 00:02:51,973
We've been here since midday.

7
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:04,102
Easterners have a difference
sense of time, I've often found.

8
00:03:04,104 --> 00:03:08,106
Once I was waiting for Salladhor
Saan here in Braavos.

9
00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:10,775
Together, we were going to run

10
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:13,327
three shiploads
of the finest--

11
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:34,382
<i>(doors close)</i>

12
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:42,740
Welcome to the Iron Bank.

13
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:46,027
Please, sit.

14
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:11,135
What can we do
for you, Lord Stannis?

15
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,137
This is Stannis
of the House Baratheon,

16
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:15,406
<i>King of the Andals</i>
<i>and the First Men,</i>

17
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,376
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

18
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:24,565
<i>The Iron Throne</i>
<i>is currently occupied</i>

19
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,484
by Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

20
00:04:26,518 --> 00:04:28,019
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

21
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:30,938
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

22
00:04:30,989 --> 00:04:33,658
He shares no blood with me.

23
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:37,078
He is a bastard born of incest.

24
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:39,163
<i>As was his brother before him.</i>

25
00:04:39,198 --> 00:04:41,949
Yes, we have heard this story.

26
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,619
It's not a story.
It's the truth.

27
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,005
The king's grandfather
tells a different story.

28
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,424
A story about a jealous uncle

29
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,660
whose attempts to usurp the
throne from the rightful king

30
00:04:52,694 --> 00:04:57,632
cost the Seven Kingdoms
dearly in blood and gold.

31
00:04:57,683 --> 00:04:59,383
Gold you loaned him.

32
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:03,621
And you feel your blood gives
you a claim on our gold?

33
00:05:03,655 --> 00:05:06,274
More than any man living.

34
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:09,227
Across the Narrow Sea,
your books are filled

35
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:12,396
with words like
«usurper» and «madman»

36
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:14,932
and «blood right.»

37
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:18,102
Here, our books
are filled with numbers.

38
00:05:18,136 --> 00:05:20,321
We prefer the stories they tell.

39
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:22,273
More plain.

40
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:25,743
Less open to interpretation.

41
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:30,865
How many fighting men
remain loyal to you?

42
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:32,250
4,000.

43
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:34,252
<i>And how many ships do you have?</i>

44
00:05:34,303 --> 00:05:36,554
<i>The ones still afloat,</i>
<i>Ser Davos,</i>

45
00:05:36,588 --> 00:05:39,056
not at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.

46
00:05:40,676 --> 00:05:42,426
32.

47
00:05:42,477 --> 00:05:44,228
And how much wheat
and barley and beef

48
00:05:44,263 --> 00:05:46,597
and pork do you produce
on Dragonstone

49
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:51,385
to feed your 4,000 men
on your 32 ships?

50
00:05:53,572 --> 00:05:55,406
None.

51
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,276
You can see why these numbers
seem unlikely to add up

52
00:05:58,278 --> 00:06:01,445
to a happy ending
from our perspective.

53
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:05,216
<i>I'm afraid we must respectfully</i>

54
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,302
<i>decline your request.</i>

55
00:06:08,337 --> 00:06:11,455
<i>But we thank you for paying</i>
<i>us the honor of your visit.</i>

56
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:21,632
My lord.

57
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:24,385
I'm not a lord,
Ser Davos Seaworth.

58
00:06:24,436 --> 00:06:26,554
You would not be either here.

59
00:06:26,588 --> 00:06:28,506
In Braavos,

60
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,776
thieves are not
rewarded with titles.

61
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,311
Well, strictly speaking,
I didn't do the thieving.

62
00:06:33,362 --> 00:06:34,946
That would be the pirates.

63
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,366
I just moved what they stole
from one place to another.

64
00:06:39,868 --> 00:06:41,902
This is the payment
that was demanded

65
00:06:41,954 --> 00:06:43,237
by King Stannis for my crimes.

66
00:06:43,288 --> 00:06:45,656
I consider it
an honest accounting.

67
00:06:45,707 --> 00:06:48,159
He's an honest man
and he's your best chance

68
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,661
to get back the money
you've sunk into Westeros.

69
00:06:50,663 --> 00:06:53,464
Which is a lot, I imagine.
Wars are expensive.

70
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:54,832
The war is over.

71
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:57,335
As long as Stannis lives,
the war is not over.

72
00:06:57,337 --> 00:06:59,337
Who's the real power
in King's Landing?

73
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:01,505
— Ser Davos...
— Humor me.

74
00:07:01,507 --> 00:07:05,142
— <i> Tywin Lannister.</i>
— How old is Tywin Lannister?

75
00:07:05,177 --> 00:07:08,579
— 67.
— 67. And when he dies, who's in command?

76
00:07:08,613 --> 00:07:10,681
A half-grown boy,

77
00:07:10,732 --> 00:07:13,017
<i>the product of incest?</i>

78
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:15,853
Cersei Lannister, a queen
whose people despise her?

79
00:07:15,855 --> 00:07:18,556
Jaime Lannister, a man best
known for killing the king

80
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,691
<i>he was sworn to protect?</i>

81
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:24,362
When Tywin's gone,
who do you back?

82
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:27,031
That is a problem
for another time.

83
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:29,333
Begging your pardon,
I think it's a problem for now.

84
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:33,504
There's only one reliable
leader left in Westeros.

85
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:35,339
Stannis.

86
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:37,208
He's got the birthright.

87
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,377
He's in his prime.

88
00:07:39,428 --> 00:07:41,128
He's a tried and tested
battle commander.

89
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:43,381
And he doesn't just talk
about paying people back,

90
00:07:43,432 --> 00:07:44,765
he does it.

91
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:51,889
Saan:<i> The lookout sees a
pirate ship sailing their way.</i>

92
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:53,891
<i>The captain shouts</i>
<i>to his first mate,</i>

93
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:55,776
«Bring me
my red shirt.»

94
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:58,779
The first mate brings the red
shirt and the captain puts it on.

95
00:07:58,814 --> 00:08:00,731
And when the pirates
try to board,

96
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:03,117
the brave captain leads
his men to victory.

97
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:06,537
A few days later,
the lookout screams,

98
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:08,372
«Two pirate ships!»

99
00:08:08,407 --> 00:08:12,209
The crew is shivering
like scared mice.

100
00:08:12,244 --> 00:08:14,211
But the courageous
captain hollers,

101
00:08:14,246 --> 00:08:16,047
«Bring me
my red shirt!»

102
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:18,299
<i>After the battle,</i>
<i>the first mate asks,</i>

103
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:22,169
«Captain, why do you call for
your red shirt before battle?»

104
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,754
The captain replies,

105
00:08:23,805 --> 00:08:27,591
«So that if I am stabbed,
you will not see me bleed.»

106
00:08:27,642 --> 00:08:29,844
The next morning
the lookout screams,

107
00:08:29,895 --> 00:08:32,346
«10 pirate ships!

108
00:08:32,397 --> 00:08:35,182
— We are surrounded!»
— (women laugh)

109
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:36,984
<i>The crew goes silent.</i>

110
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:39,520
<i>They all look</i>
<i>to their brave captain,</i>

111
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:41,655
<i>waiting for his usual command.</i>

112
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,691
<i>Calm as ever,</i>
<i>the captain bellows...</i>

113
00:08:43,742 --> 00:08:46,110
Women: — «Bring me my brown pants!»

114
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:48,913
(laughs)

115
00:08:48,947 --> 00:08:52,416
You think they ever met a pirate
who didn't tell them that joke?

116
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:55,870
— Davos.
— (chuckles)

117
00:08:55,954 --> 00:08:58,289
I heard you were rotting in
a dungeon in Dragonstone.

118
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,624
Only half rotted.

119
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:03,177
(laughs)

120
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:05,346
Join us, my friend.
Join us.

121
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,299
— This is Lhara.
— (gasps)

122
00:09:08,301 --> 00:09:09,900
— And this is--
— I am Lhara.

123
00:09:09,935 --> 00:09:11,635
(squeals)

124
00:09:11,637 --> 00:09:13,137
(laughs)

125
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:15,606
She's an artist,
this one, truly.

126
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,976
No time, I'm afraid.
We sail at sunrise.

127
00:09:19,027 --> 00:09:20,444
We?

128
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:22,646
You, me–we.

129
00:09:22,697 --> 00:09:24,782
(scoffs)

130
00:09:24,816 --> 00:09:27,985
Once I thought
this man loved me.

131
00:09:27,987 --> 00:09:32,156
<i>Now I know he despises me.</i>

132
00:09:32,158 --> 00:09:36,544
He wants to see me die poor
and alone on some cold--

133
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:48,172
You won't be alone.

134
00:09:48,174 --> 00:09:49,723
And you won't be poor.

135
00:09:57,516 --> 00:10:00,100
There's a chest of the good
stuff left back at your house.

136
00:10:00,152 --> 00:10:02,019
I gave it to your wife.

137
00:10:02,021 --> 00:10:05,272
(women laugh)

138
00:10:05,323 --> 00:10:07,691
You're not my friend, my friend.

139
00:10:07,742 --> 00:10:09,443
(laughs)

140
00:10:09,494 --> 00:10:11,328
I'll see you at sunrise.

141
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:16,584
Yara: «I give you
until the full moon

142
00:10:16,618 --> 00:10:20,204
to order all ironborn
scum out of the North

143
00:10:20,255 --> 00:10:23,924
<i>and back to those shit-stained
rocks you call home.</i>

144
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:25,960
On the first night
of the full moon,

145
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:28,762
I will hunt down every
islander still on our lands

146
00:10:28,797 --> 00:10:30,714
and flay them living,

147
00:10:30,716 --> 00:10:33,384
the way I flayed
the 20 ironborn scum

148
00:10:33,435 --> 00:10:35,019
I found at Winterfell.

149
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:38,889
<i>In the box you'll find</i>
<i>a special gift--</i>

150
00:10:39,941 --> 00:10:42,393
<i>Theon's favorite toy.</i>

151
00:10:42,444 --> 00:10:45,229
<i>He cried when I took</i>
<i>it away from him.</i>

152
00:10:46,615 --> 00:10:49,400
<i>Leave the North now</i>
<i>or more boxes will follow</i>

153
00:10:49,402 --> 00:10:51,569
<i>with more Theon.</i>

154
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,621

<i>and Warden of the North.»</i>

158
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,048
Yes!

159
00:11:04,132 --> 00:11:06,217
Yara: — <i>They skinned our countrymen</i>

160
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:09,003
<i>and they mutilated my brother,</i>

161
00:11:09,054 --> 00:11:11,388
<i>your prince.</i>

162
00:11:11,423 --> 00:11:13,474
<i>Your prince.</i>

163
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:16,260
<i>Everything they've done to him,</i>

164
00:11:16,262 --> 00:11:18,345
<i>they've also done to you.</i>

165
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:19,813
Yes! Yes!

166
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:23,767
Yara: <i>As long as they can hurt
our prince with impunity,</i>

167
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:27,771
<i>the word ironborn means nothing.</i>

168
00:11:29,024 --> 00:11:31,942
— (moaning loudly)
— <i> (metal clinking)</i>

00:11:33,912 --> 00:11:37,114
<i>(Myranda moaning)</i>

(grunts)

171
00:11:51,713 --> 00:11:53,631
Go left.

172
00:11:53,682 --> 00:11:56,133
(men whispering)

173
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:01,972
(groans)

174
00:12:01,974 --> 00:12:04,808
— Theon Greyjoy.
— I don't know--

175
00:12:04,893 --> 00:12:06,193
I'm here for Theon Greyjoy.

176
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:07,561
Take me to the dungeons.

177
00:12:07,612 --> 00:12:09,813
He's not in the dungeons.

178
00:12:12,651 --> 00:12:14,818
(dogs panting)

179
00:12:21,076 --> 00:12:23,911
(raspy breathing)

180
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,334

— <i> (alarm ringing)</i>
— <i> (men shouting)</i>

182
00:12:34,172 --> 00:12:36,340
— Last cage on the right.
— Thank you.

183
00:12:36,391 --> 00:12:39,009

184
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,844
— <i> (swords clanging)</i>
— Man:<i> This way!</i>

186
00:12:48,403 --> 00:12:50,270
(whimpering)

187
00:12:54,693 --> 00:12:56,243
We're going home.

188
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,997
No!

189
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,170
It's all right.
It's me, Yara.

190
00:13:06,204 --> 00:13:08,339
You can't trick me.

191
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:10,541
Tell him. Tell him you
couldn't trick me.

192
00:13:10,543 --> 00:13:12,376
I'm not tricking you, Theon.
I'm saving you.

193
00:13:12,378 --> 00:13:13,761
Not Theon! Reek!

194
00:13:13,845 --> 00:13:15,546
— Reek! My name is Reek!
— First mate:<i> They're here.</i>

195
00:13:15,548 --> 00:13:17,047
If they catch us
in here, we're trapped.

196
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:18,716
Help me with him.

197
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:20,634
No, you can't!

198
00:13:20,685 --> 00:13:22,436
— You can't!
— You're Theon Greyjoy.

199
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,607
No, I don't believe her!
I know who I am!

200
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:29,893
I'm Reek! Reek!
Loyal Reek!

201
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:32,730
Good Reek!
I've always been Reek!

202
00:13:34,115 --> 00:13:36,817
— <i> (dogs barking)</i>
— <i> (Theon whimpering)</i>

203
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:46,076
This is turning into
a lovely evening.

204
00:13:46,995 --> 00:13:49,463

205
00:13:58,256 --> 00:13:59,923

— (laughs)

207
00:14:02,477 --> 00:14:03,977
Theon: — <i>I'm Reek!</i>

208
00:14:04,012 --> 00:14:05,929
Loyal Reek!

209
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:15,355
Aah!
Theon!

210
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,840
Give me my broth You've got
bigger balls than he ever did.

211
00:14:36,726 --> 00:14:40,595
But with those big balls
of yours...

212
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:47,769
how fast can you run?

213
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:52,824

<i>(dogs barking)</i>

215
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,249
Make for the ship, now.

216
00:15:01,284 --> 00:15:02,951
But your brother.

217
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,953
My brother is dead.

218
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:15,430
Ramsay: — I have a treat for you.

219
00:15:15,465 --> 00:15:17,132
A reward.

220
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,718
Reward?

221
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,020
Yes, Reek.

222
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:24,973
Those creatures
who came in the night,

223
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:27,642
they wanted to take you away.

224
00:15:27,644 --> 00:15:29,611
And you didn't let them.

225
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:32,047
You remained loyal.

226
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:35,984
I – I didn't want
them to take me.

227
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,737
I was so scared.

228
00:15:38,788 --> 00:15:41,073
— I didn't want them--
— Yes, yes, Reek.

229
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,300
It's a bath.

230
00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:54,669
For you.

231
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,392
Remove those rags.

232
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,428
Now.

233
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,030
The britches, too, Reek.

234
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,698
Take them off.

235
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,858

236
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:01,286

239
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:52,621
Do you love me, Reek?

240
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:01,129
Yes, of course, my lord.

241
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:04,382
Good.

242
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:06,768
Because I need you
to do something for me.

243
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:08,854
Something very important.

244
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:12,140
There's a castle, you see.

245
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,277
Some bad men hold this castle.

246
00:18:16,646 --> 00:18:19,481
I need your help
to take this castle back.

247
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,786
But how can--

248
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:29,324
I need you to play a role.

249
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:33,411
To pretend to be someone
you're not.

250
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:39,167
Pretend to be who?

251
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:42,003
Theon Greyjoy.

252

00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:29,894
He is a goatherd.

270
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:33,465
He says he prayed for your victory
against the slave masters.

271
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:36,101
I thank him for his prayers.

272
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:38,203

273
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:48,496

274
00:20:51,634 --> 00:20:53,601
It was your dragons, he says.

He hopes he has not
offended Your Grace,

278
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:04,979
but now he has nothing.

279
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:08,199
Tell this man I am sorry
for his hardship.

— (translating)
— <i> I cannot bring back his goats,</i>

281
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:16,908
but I will see he is paid
their value three times over.

282
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:21,329
(speaking Low Valyrian)

283
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:35,510
Send the next one in.

284
00:21:43,363 --> 00:21:48,627
—

285
00:21:49,693 --> 00:21:56,127
—

286
00:22:09,512 --> 00:22:11,179
Queen Daenerys.

287
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:13,264
Tales of your beauty
were not exaggerated.

288
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,350
I thank you.

289
00:22:15,384 --> 00:22:18,386
Mine is one of the oldest and
proudest families in Meereen.

290
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:21,055
Then it is my honor
to receive you.

291
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,025
My father, one of
Meereen's most respected

292
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:27,028
and beloved citizens,
oversaw the restoration

293
00:22:27,062 --> 00:22:29,364
and maintenance
of its greatest landmarks.

294
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:30,915
This pyramid included.

295
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,118
For that, he has my gratitude.

296
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,819
I should be honored to meet him.

297
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,304
You have, Your Grace.

298
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:38,139
You crucified him.

299
00:22:40,376 --> 00:22:42,410
I pray you'll never live to see

300
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,412
a member of your family
treated so cruelly.

301
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:47,982
Your father crucified
innocent children.

302
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:51,469
My father spoke out against
crucifying those children.

303
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:54,706
He decried it as a criminal
act, but was overruled.

304
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,076
Is it justice to answer
one crime with another?

305
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:00,562
I am sorry you no longer
have a father,

306
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:03,932
but my treatment
of the masters was no crime.

307
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:06,751
You'd be wise to remember that.

308
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:09,737
What's done is done.

309
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:12,907
You are the queen and I
am a servant of Meereen.

310
00:23:12,942 --> 00:23:16,611
A servant who does not wish to
see its traditions eradicated.

311
00:23:16,613 --> 00:23:19,447
And what traditions
do you speak of?

312
00:23:19,449 --> 00:23:21,449
<i>The tradition of funeral rite.</i>

313
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,785
Proper burial in
the Temple of the Graces.

314
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:28,373
My father and 162
noble Meereenese

315
00:23:28,424 --> 00:23:30,758
are still nailed to those posts,

316
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:33,962
carrion for vultures,
rotting in the sun.

317
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,024
Your Grace, I ask that you
order these men taken down

318
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:48,276
so that they might receive
proper burials.

319
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:52,480
And what of the slave children
these noble Meereenese crucified?

320
00:23:52,482 --> 00:23:54,983
They were rotting
in the sun as well.

321
00:23:54,985 --> 00:23:58,653
<i>Would you have begged me for
their right to a proper burial?</i>

322
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:01,406
Your Grace, I cannot defend
the actions of the masters.

323
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,376
I can only speak to you as a
son who loved his father.

324
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:07,662
<i>Let me take his body down.</i>

325
00:24:07,664 --> 00:24:10,548
<i>Let me have him brought</i>
<i>to the temple</i>

326
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,083
and buried with dignity

327
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:14,502
so that he might find
peace in the next world.

328
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,392
Bury your father,
Hizdahr zo Loraq.

329
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,399
Thank you, my queen.

330
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,379
How many more?

331
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,699
There are 212 supplicants
waiting, Your Grace.

332
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,535
212?

333
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,512
Send the next one in.

334
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:02,133
These meetings aren't always going
to be this early, are they?

335
00:25:02,184 --> 00:25:05,270
I was up late last night.

336
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:09,307
So, does this mean I am a
master of something now?

337
00:25:09,358 --> 00:25:11,225
Coins, ships?

338
00:25:11,227 --> 00:25:13,478
Lord Tywin and I
already determined

339
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:16,731
that I shall be the Master
of Ships long before you--

340
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,738
Lord Tywin, it's a great honor

341
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,240
to have been granted a
seat on this council. I--

342
00:25:26,242 --> 00:25:28,242
Tywin: <i>The trial
begins this afternoon.</i>

343
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:30,461
We only have the morning
for affairs of state.

344
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:31,963
Shall we begin?

345
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,998
Varys: Sandor Clegane
has been spotted

346
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:36,834
in the Riverlands, my lord.

347
00:25:36,885 --> 00:25:38,219
A coward and a traitor.

348
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:42,507
My birds tell me the Hound
slaughtered five of our soldiers.

349
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:45,259
I believe the phrase
«fuck the king» was uttered.

350
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:47,061
Disgraceful.

351
00:25:47,096 --> 00:25:48,930
Tywin: <i>What would it take
to make the common soldier</i>

352
00:25:48,932 --> 00:25:51,232
stupid enough to try
his luck with the Hound?

353
00:25:51,266 --> 00:25:53,835
10 silver stags
seems a generous bounty.

354
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:56,688
Make it 100.
What else?

355
00:25:56,739 --> 00:25:59,273
More whispers
from the east, my lord.

356
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:00,858
The Targaryen girl?

357
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:03,695
Daenerys has taken up
residence in Meereen.

358
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:07,348
She has conquered the city
and rules as its queen.

359
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:08,950
Conquered with what?

360
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,918
Varys: <i>She commands an army
of Unsullied, my queen.</i>

361
00:26:10,953 --> 00:26:12,954
Some 8,000 strong.

362
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,289
She has a company
of sellswords--

363
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:16,674
the Second Sons.

364
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:19,127
<i>She has two knights</i>
<i>advising her--</i>

365
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:22,430
Jorah Mormont
and Barristan Selmy.

366
00:26:22,464 --> 00:26:24,465
And she has three dragons.

367
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:25,933
Baby dragons.

368
00:26:25,968 --> 00:26:28,102
Larger every year, Your Grace.

369
00:26:28,137 --> 00:26:31,606
Mormont is spying on her for us.

370
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,609
No longer. He appears
to be fully devoted to her.

371
00:26:34,643 --> 00:26:37,645
As for Ser Barristan,
it would seem

372
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,314
he took his dismissal
from the Kingsguard

373
00:26:40,316 --> 00:26:42,150
a bit harder than anticipated.

374
00:26:42,152 --> 00:26:44,068
He's an old man.

375
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:46,020
He wasn't fit to protect my son.

376
00:26:46,055 --> 00:26:48,072
Joffrey didn't die on his watch.

377
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:51,409
Dismissing him was as
insulting as it was stupid.

378
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,562
Don't tell me you're worried about
a child halfway across the world.

379
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:58,166
A child with two seasoned
warriors counseling her

380
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,419
and a powerful army
at her back, Your Grace.

381
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,504
Lord Varys is right.

382
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:06,007
I have been to Essos and seen
the Unsullied firsthand.

383
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:09,577
They are very impressive
on the battlefield.

384
00:27:09,611 --> 00:27:11,345
Less so in the bedroom.

385
00:27:11,347 --> 00:27:14,182
Dragons haven't won
a war in 300 years.

386
00:27:14,184 --> 00:27:16,734
Armies win them all the time.

387
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:19,020
She must be dealt with.

388
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,072
How, my lord?

389
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,440
By force?

390
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:24,509
Eventually, if it comes to that.

391
00:27:26,662 --> 00:27:29,614
Can your little birds
find their way into Meereen?

392
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,666
Most certainly, my Lord Hand.

393
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,619
Mmm. Lord Tyrell,
be a good man.

394
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,370
<i>Fetch my quill and paper.</i>

395
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:51,219
<i>(footsteps)</i>

396
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:59,444
Prince Oberyn.

397
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:01,896
Lord Varys...

398
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:05,133
Only Varys.
I'm not actually a nobleman.

399
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:07,702
No one is under obligation
to call me lord.

400
00:28:07,736 --> 00:28:09,570
And yet everyone does.

401
00:28:12,074 --> 00:28:14,542
You seem quite knowledgeable
about the Unsullied.

402
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:16,494
Did you spend much time
in Essos?

403
00:28:16,578 --> 00:28:19,213
Five years.

404
00:28:19,248 --> 00:28:20,832
May I ask why?

405
00:28:20,883 --> 00:28:23,718
'Tis a big and beautiful world.

406
00:28:23,752 --> 00:28:26,420
Most of us live and die

407
00:28:26,422 --> 00:28:28,139
in the same corner
where we were born

408
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:31,092
and never get to see any of it.

409
00:28:31,094 --> 00:28:33,728
I don't want to be most of us.

410
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:35,763
Most of us aren't princes.

411
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:40,601
(chuckles)
You are from Essos.

412
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,488
Where? Lys?

413
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:46,524
<i>I have an ear for accents.</i>

414
00:28:46,575 --> 00:28:48,242
I've lost my accent entirely.

415
00:28:48,277 --> 00:28:49,777
I have an ear for that as well.

416
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,831
<i>How did you get here?</i>

417
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:55,449
It's a long story.

418
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:58,452
One you don't like
telling people.

419
00:28:58,504 --> 00:29:01,122
People I trust.

420
00:29:01,124 --> 00:29:04,208
My paramour Ellaria, she would
find you very interesting.

421
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:06,544
You should come to
the brothel and meet her.

422
00:29:06,595 --> 00:29:09,630
We brought our own wine, not
the swill they serve here.

423
00:29:09,632 --> 00:29:12,800
We have some lovely
boys on retainer, but...

424
00:29:15,704 --> 00:29:18,105
You did like boys before?

425
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:22,059
Really?

426
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,978
Girls? Hmm.

427
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,647
I hope you won't be offended when
I say I never would have guessed.

428
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,149
Not at all.

429
00:29:28,151 --> 00:29:30,985
But I was never interested
in girls, either.

430
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:33,454
— What then?
— <i> Nothing.</i>

431
00:29:33,488 --> 00:29:36,290
Everybody is interested
in something.

432
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:38,075
<i>Not me.</i>

433
00:29:38,126 --> 00:29:40,328
When I see what
desire does to people,

434
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,296
what it's done to this country,

435
00:29:42,331 --> 00:29:45,166
I am very glad
to have no part in it.

436
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:49,637
<i>Besides, the absence of desire</i>

437
00:29:49,671 --> 00:29:52,757
leaves one free to pursue
other things.

438
00:29:52,808 --> 00:29:54,475
Such as?

439
00:30:19,334 --> 00:30:21,586
<i>(keys clinking)</i>

440
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:32,680
Let me guess,
I've been pardoned.

441
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:50,731
Really?

442
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:53,734
Father's orders.

443
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:57,571
Well, we mustn't
disappoint Father.

444
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,963
(crowd murmuring)

445
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,917
Man: — <i>Kingslayer!</i>

446
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:59,050
I, Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

447
00:31:59,101 --> 00:32:00,801
<i>First of my Name,</i>

448
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:03,137
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

449
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:05,806
and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,

450
00:32:05,808 --> 00:32:09,560
do hereby recuse myself
from this trial.

451
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:12,730
Tywin of the House Lannister,
Hand of the King,

452
00:32:12,781 --> 00:32:16,667
Protector of the Realm,
will sit as judge in my stead.

453
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:20,621
And with him Prince Oberyn
of the House Martell

454
00:32:20,655 --> 00:32:23,941
<i>and Lord Mace</i>
<i>of the House Tyrell.</i>

455
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,327
And if found guilty...

456
00:32:28,497 --> 00:32:30,247
may the gods punish the accused.

457
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:08,252
Tyrion of the House Lannister,

458
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:12,373
you stand accused by
the Queen Regent of regicide.

459
00:33:13,675 --> 00:33:16,043
Did you kill King Joffrey?

460
00:33:17,379 --> 00:33:18,679
No.

461
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:21,048
Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?

462
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,517
Not that I know of.

463
00:33:23,552 --> 00:33:26,854
How would you say he died, then?

464
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:29,056
Choked on his pigeon pie.

465
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:32,526
So you would blame the bakers?

466
00:33:32,561 --> 00:33:34,945
Or the pigeons.
Just leave me out of it.

467
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,897
<i>(crowd murmuring)</i>

468
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:40,901
The crown may call
its first witness.

469
00:33:40,903 --> 00:33:43,070
Once we'd got
King Joffrey safely away

470
00:33:43,072 --> 00:33:45,072
from the mob,
the Imp rounded on him.

471
00:33:45,074 --> 00:33:47,408
He slapped the king
across the face

472
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,910
and called him a vicious
idiot and a fool.

473
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,579
(crowd gasps)

474
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,714
<i>It wasn't the first time</i>
<i>the Imp threatened Joffrey.</i>

475
00:33:53,748 --> 00:33:55,633
Right here in this throne room,

476
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,552
he marched up those steps
and called our king a halfwit.

477
00:33:58,587 --> 00:34:00,888
<i>Compared His Grace</i>
<i>to the Mad King</i>

478
00:34:00,922 --> 00:34:02,756
<i>and suggested he'd meet</i>
<i>the same fate.</i>

479
00:34:02,758 --> 00:34:04,592
And when I spoke
in the king's defense,

480
00:34:04,594 --> 00:34:06,927
he threatened to have me killed.

481
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,979
Oh, why don't you tell
them what Joffrey was doing?

482
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:11,816
— Tywin:<i> Silence.</i>
— Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark

483
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,490
while you tore at her
clothes and beat her.

484
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:16,237
Silence!

485
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:20,157
You will not speak
unless called upon.

486
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,694
You're dismissed, Ser Meryn.

487
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:32,786
Basilisk venom,

488
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:35,339
widow's blood,

489
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,625
wolfsbane,

490
00:34:37,627 --> 00:34:39,844
essence of nightshade,

491
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:42,763
sweetsleep,

492
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:44,882
tears of Lys,

493
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:47,134
demon's dance...

494
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,303
(mumbling)

495
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:50,888
blind eye--

496
00:34:50,939 --> 00:34:53,140
I think you have made your
point, Grand Maester.

497
00:34:53,142 --> 00:34:54,975
You have a lot of poison
in your store.

498
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,027
<i>Had,</i> Prince Oberyn.

499
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:59,980
My stores were plundered.

500
00:34:59,982 --> 00:35:01,315
By whom?

501
00:35:01,317 --> 00:35:04,201
Pycelle: <i>By the accused,
Tyrion Lannister,</i>

502
00:35:04,286 --> 00:35:06,654
after he had me
wrongfully imprisoned.

503
00:35:06,656 --> 00:35:09,156
Tywin: — <i>Grand Maester,</i>

504
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:12,209
you examined
King Joffrey's corpse.

505
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:16,547
Was it without question
poison that killed him?

506
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,133
Without question.

507
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:21,418
<i>(crowd murmuring)</i>

508
00:35:21,469 --> 00:35:25,005
This was found on the body
of Dontos Hollard,

509
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,624
the king's fool.

510
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:30,678
He was last seen
spiriting Sansa Stark,

511
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:34,481
the wife of the accused,
away from the feast.

512
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:37,935
She wore this necklace

513
00:35:37,986 --> 00:35:40,187
<i>the day of the wedding.</i>

514
00:35:40,189 --> 00:35:43,490
<i>Residue of a most rare</i>

515
00:35:43,525 --> 00:35:47,494
and terrible poison
was found inside.

516
00:35:47,529 --> 00:35:51,498
Was this one of the poisons
stolen from your store?

517
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:54,585
It was.
The Strangler.

518
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:58,455
A poison few in
the Seven Kingdoms possess.

519
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:03,093
And used to strike down
the most noble child

520
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:05,930
the gods ever put
on this good earth.

521
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:08,549
(crowd murmuring)

522
00:36:13,822 --> 00:36:16,140
Cersei: — <i>«I will hurt you for this.</i>

523
00:36:16,191 --> 00:36:18,943
<i>A day will come when you</i>
<i>think you are safe and happy</i>

524
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:21,395
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth

525
00:36:21,397 --> 00:36:23,564
and you will know
the debt is paid.»

526
00:36:23,566 --> 00:36:27,201
Your own brother
said this to you?

527
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:31,372
Shortly before the Battle
of Blackwater Bay.

528
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:35,626
I confronted him about his plans
to put Joffrey on the front lines.

529
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:39,897
As it turned out,
when the attack came,

530
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,249
Joff insisted on remaining
at the battlements.

531
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:46,170
He believed his presence
would inspire the troops.

532
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:49,256
Tyrion said,

533
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:51,976
«And you will know
the debt is paid.»

534
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,278
What debt?

535
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,264
I discovered
he'd been keeping whores

536
00:36:57,266 --> 00:36:59,099
in the Tower of the Hand.

537
00:36:59,101 --> 00:37:01,602
I asked him to confine
his salacious acts

538
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:04,271
<i>to the brothel</i>
<i>where such behavior belongs.</i>

539
00:37:04,273 --> 00:37:06,240
He wasn't pleased.

540
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,995
Thank you, Your Grace,

541
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:13,330
for the courage
of your testimony.

542
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:31,382
Mace:<i> Do you remember the
precise nature of this threat?</i>

543
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:33,967
Varys: — <i>I'm afraid I do, my lord.</i>

544
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:37,971
<i>He said, «Perhaps you should
speak more softly to me, then.</i>

545
00:37:37,973 --> 00:37:39,890
Monsters are dangerous

546
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:42,359
and just now kings
are dying like flies.»

547
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,696
And he said this to you at a
meeting of the small council?

548
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,980
Yes.

549
00:37:46,982 --> 00:37:50,117
After we received word
of Robb Stark's death.

550
00:37:50,151 --> 00:37:52,403
He didn't seem gladdened
by the news.

551
00:37:52,454 --> 00:37:54,905
Perhaps his marriage
to Sansa Stark

552
00:37:54,956 --> 00:37:57,374
had made him more sympathetic
to the northern cause.

553
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:59,660
(crowd murmuring)

554
00:38:01,496 --> 00:38:03,831
You're excused, Lord Varys.

555
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:08,919
Father, may I ask
the witness one question?

556
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,677
One.

557
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:21,815
You once said

558
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:25,569
that without me, this city would
have faced certain defeat.

559
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:29,189
You said the histories
would never mention me,

560
00:38:29,191 --> 00:38:31,859
but you would not forget.

561
00:38:33,194 --> 00:38:35,829
Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?

562
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:40,451
Sadly, my lord,

563
00:38:40,502 --> 00:38:43,203
I never forget a thing.

564
00:38:52,881 --> 00:38:55,349
We will adjourn for now.

565
00:38:56,718 --> 00:38:59,303
Toll the bells
in an hour's time.

566
00:38:59,354 --> 00:39:01,522
Guard: — <i>Clear the court!</i>

567
00:39:10,398 --> 00:39:13,367
(crowd chatting)

568
00:39:21,376 --> 00:39:23,961
Jaime: <i>You'd condemn
your own son to death?</i>

569
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:26,163
I've condemned no one.
The trial is not over.

570
00:39:26,214 --> 00:39:27,714
This isn't a trial.
It's a farce.

571
00:39:27,749 --> 00:39:30,050
Cersei has manipulated
everything and you know it.

572
00:39:30,084 --> 00:39:31,502
I know nothing of the sort.

573
00:39:31,553 --> 00:39:34,054
— You've always hated Tyrion.
— He killed his king.

574
00:39:34,088 --> 00:39:35,923
As did I.

575
00:39:35,925 --> 00:39:38,509
Do you know the last order
the Mad King gave me?

576
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,411
<i>To bring him your head.</i>

577
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:43,931
I saved your life so you
could murder my brother?

578
00:39:43,933 --> 00:39:46,733
— It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
— Justice?

579
00:39:46,768 --> 00:39:49,937
I'm performing my sworn
duty as Hand of the King.

580
00:39:49,939 --> 00:39:53,023
If Tyrion is found guilty, he
will be punished accordingly.

581
00:39:53,074 --> 00:39:55,642
— He'll be executed.
— No, he'll be punished accordingly.

582
00:39:57,946 --> 00:40:01,248
Once you said family
is what lives on.

583
00:40:01,282 --> 00:40:03,283
All that lives on.

584
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:06,787
You told me about a dynasty
that would last 1,000 years.

585
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:09,706
What happens to your dynasty
when Tyrion dies?

586
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:12,626
I'm a Kingsguard,

587
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:14,545
forbidden by oath
to carry on the family line.

588
00:40:14,596 --> 00:40:16,296
I'm well aware of your oath.

589
00:40:16,298 --> 00:40:18,432
What happens to your name?

590
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:21,802
Who carries the lion banner
into future battles?

591
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:23,804
Your nephews?

592
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:25,439
Lancel Lannister?

593
00:40:25,473 --> 00:40:27,691
Others whose names
I don't even remember?

594
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,393
What happens to my dynasty

595
00:40:29,444 --> 00:40:31,662
if I spare the life
of my grandson's killer?

596
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:34,281
It survives through me.

597
00:40:36,818 --> 00:40:38,652
I'll leave the Kingsguard.

598
00:40:38,654 --> 00:40:41,488
I'll take my place
as your son and heir

599
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:44,374
if you let Tyrion live.

600
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:45,876
Done.

601
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:50,998
When the testimony's concluded
and a guilty verdict rendered,

602
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,749
Tyrion will be given
the chance to speak.

603
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,803
He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow
him to join the Night's Watch.

604
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,341
<i>In three days' time, he'll
depart for Castle Black</i>

605
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,060
<i>and live out his days</i>
<i>at the Wall.</i>

606
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:05,679
<i>You'll remove your</i>
<i>white cloak immediately.</i>

607
00:41:05,681 --> 00:41:07,681
<i>You will leave King's Landing</i>

608
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:09,933
<i>to assume your rightful</i>
<i>place at Casterly Rock.</i>

609
00:41:09,984 --> 00:41:12,402
You will marry a suitable woman

610
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:15,489
and father children
named Lannister.

611
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:19,409
And you'll never turn your
back on your family again.

612
00:41:24,532 --> 00:41:26,033
You have my word.

613
00:41:26,035 --> 00:41:27,868
And you have mine.

614
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:34,841
<i>(bell tolling)</i>

615
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,111
Not going well, is it?

616
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:56,613
— You're going to be found guilty.
— Oh, you think so?

617
00:41:56,648 --> 00:41:59,399
When you are, you need to
enter a formal plea for mercy

618
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,702
and ask to be sent to the Wall.

619
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:03,704
Father's agreed to it.

620
00:42:03,738 --> 00:42:06,456
He'll spare your life and allow
you to join the Night's Watch.

621
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:09,126
Ned Stark was promised
the same thing

622
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,128
<i>and we both know</i>
<i>how that turned out.</i>

623
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:13,080
Jaime: <i>Father is not Joffrey.
He'll keep his word.</i>

624
00:42:13,082 --> 00:42:14,915
How do you know?

625
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,637
Do you trust me?

626
00:42:23,591 --> 00:42:26,176
Keep your mouth shut.
No more outbursts.

627
00:42:26,227 --> 00:42:28,261
This will all be over soon.

628
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:47,114
The crown may call
its next witness.

629
00:42:51,586 --> 00:42:54,287
<i>(footsteps)</i>

630
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,650
State your name.

631
00:43:23,652 --> 00:43:25,652
Shae.

632
00:43:25,654 --> 00:43:27,871
Do you swear by all the gods

633
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,457
that your testimony
will be true and honest?

634
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:33,326
I swear it.

635
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:35,162
Do you know this man?

636
00:43:42,837 --> 00:43:46,073
Yes.
Tyrion Lannister.

637
00:43:46,107 --> 00:43:47,924
How do you know him?

638
00:43:47,975 --> 00:43:51,228
I was handmaiden
to his wife Lady Sansa.

639
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:55,348
This man stands accused
of murdering King Joffrey.

640
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,567
What do you know of this?

641
00:43:59,187 --> 00:44:01,488
I know that he's guilty.

642
00:44:01,522 --> 00:44:02,773
(crowd gasps)

643
00:44:02,824 --> 00:44:04,908
He and Sansa
planned it together.

644
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:06,193
(crowd murmuring)

645
00:44:06,195 --> 00:44:08,695
Tywin: — <i>Silence!</i>

646
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:11,248
<i>Continue.</i>

647
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:14,201
Shae: <i>She wanted revenge
for her father,</i>

648
00:44:14,203 --> 00:44:15,702
<i>her mother, her brother.</i>

649
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:18,538
<i>She blamed their deaths</i>
<i>on the king.</i>

650
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,957
<i>Tyrion was happy to help.</i>

651
00:44:21,008 --> 00:44:24,628
He hated Joffrey.
He hated the queen.

652
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:27,697
He hated you, my lord.

653
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:30,884
He stole poison from
the Grand Maester's chamber

654
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:32,786
to put in Joffrey's wine.

655
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,355
Oberyn: <i>How could you
possibly know all this?</i>

656
00:44:35,389 --> 00:44:39,192
Why would he reveal
such plans to his wife's maid?

657
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:43,246
I wasn't just her maid.

658
00:44:46,067 --> 00:44:47,734
I was his whore.

659
00:44:47,736 --> 00:44:50,737
— (crowd murmuring)
— Mace:<i> I beg your pardon?</i>

660
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:52,405
You said you were his...

661
00:44:52,457 --> 00:44:54,291
His whore.

662
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:59,629
How did you come
to be in his service?

663
00:44:59,664 --> 00:45:00,964
He stole me.

664
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:02,499
I was with another man,

665
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,084
a knight in
your lordship's army.

666
00:45:04,086 --> 00:45:06,636
But when Tyrion arrived
at the camp,

667
00:45:06,721 --> 00:45:08,889
he sent one of his cutthroats
into our tent.

668
00:45:08,923 --> 00:45:13,426
<i>He broke the knight's arm</i>
<i>and brought me to Lord Tyrion.</i>

669
00:45:13,428 --> 00:45:15,929
«You belong to me now,» he said.

670
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,933
«I want you to fuck me like it's
my last night in this world.»

671
00:45:19,935 --> 00:45:22,652
(crowd laughs)

672
00:45:22,687 --> 00:45:25,405
Silence.
Silence!

673
00:45:25,439 --> 00:45:26,656
<i>(laughing stops)</i>

674
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:28,325
Oberyn: — And did you?

675
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:30,861
Did I what?

676
00:45:30,912 --> 00:45:33,580
Fuck him like it was
his last night in this world.

677
00:45:33,614 --> 00:45:35,582
<i>(crowd laughs)</i>

678
00:45:35,616 --> 00:45:38,084
I did everything he wanted.

679
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:40,170
Whatever he told me
to do to him.

680
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,066
Whatever he felt like doing to me.

681
00:45:42,305 --> 00:45:44,187
<i>I kissed him where he wanted.</i>

682
00:45:44,307 --> 00:45:45,709
<i>I licked him where he wanted.</i>

683
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:49,144
<i>I let him put himself</i>
<i>where he wanted.</i>

684
00:45:49,195 --> 00:45:51,113
I was his property.

685
00:45:51,147 --> 00:45:53,365
I would wait in his chambers
for hours

686
00:45:53,399 --> 00:45:55,234
so he could use me
when he was bored.

687
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:59,204
He ordered me to call
him «my lion,» so I did.

688
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:02,908
I took his face
in my hands and said,

689
00:46:02,959 --> 00:46:05,994
«I am yours
and you are mine.»

690
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:08,830
(crowd murmuring)

691
00:46:09,716 --> 00:46:11,250
Shae.

692
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:16,505
Please don't.

693
00:46:18,725 --> 00:46:21,059
I am a whore.

694
00:46:21,094 --> 00:46:23,679
<i>Remember?</i>

695
00:46:25,648 --> 00:46:27,683
That was before
he married Sansa.

696
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:30,352
After that,
all he wanted was her.

697
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,938
But she wouldn't let him
into her bed.

698
00:46:34,407 --> 00:46:37,192
So he promised to kill
King Joffrey for her.

699
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:39,194
<i>(crowd clamoring)</i>

700
00:46:48,421 --> 00:46:51,039
I wish to confess.

701
00:46:52,258 --> 00:46:55,543
I wish...
to confess.

702
00:46:55,594 --> 00:46:57,679
<i>(crowd quiets)</i>

00:46:57,713 --> 00:47:00,215
You wish to confess?

704
00:47:02,101 --> 00:47:03,718
I saved you.

705
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,772
I saved this city

706
00:47:07,807 --> 00:47:11,309
and all your worthless lives.

707
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,863
I should have let
Stannis kill you all.

708
00:47:14,897 --> 00:47:17,532
— (clamoring)
— Tywin: Tyrion.

709
00:47:20,403 --> 00:47:22,904
Tywin: — Do you wish to confess?

710
00:47:26,459 --> 00:47:29,044
Yes, Father.

711
00:47:29,078 --> 00:47:31,579
I'm guilty.

712
00:47:31,614 --> 00:47:34,582
Guilty. Is that what
you want to hear?

713
00:47:34,584 --> 00:47:36,718
You admit you poisoned the king?

714
00:47:36,752 --> 00:47:39,304
No, of that I'm innocent.

715
00:47:39,338 --> 00:47:43,341
I'm guilty of a far
more monstrous crime.

716
00:47:43,392 --> 00:47:46,845
I am guilty of being a dwarf.

717
00:47:48,013 --> 00:47:50,432
You are not on trial
for being a dwarf.

718
00:47:50,483 --> 00:47:52,701
Tyrion: — <i>Oh, yes, I am.</i>

719
00:47:52,735 --> 00:47:56,938
I've been on trial
for that my entire life.

720
00:47:58,157 --> 00:47:59,858
Have you nothing to say
in your defense?

721
00:47:59,892 --> 00:48:01,292
Tyrion: — <i>Nothing but this--</i>

722
00:48:01,327 --> 00:48:04,279
I did not do it.

723
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:07,248
I did not kill Joffrey,

724
00:48:07,283 --> 00:48:09,584
but I wish that I had.

725
00:48:09,618 --> 00:48:12,454
<i>Watching your vicious</i>
<i>bastard die</i>

726
00:48:12,505 --> 00:48:16,591
gave me more relief
than 1,000 lying whores.

727
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:19,511
<i>(crowd clamoring)</i>

728
00:48:19,545 --> 00:48:23,965
I wish I was the monster
you think I am.

729
00:48:25,351 --> 00:48:28,937
I wish I had enough poison
for the whole pack of you.

730
00:48:28,971 --> 00:48:31,139
I would gladly give my life

731
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,475
to watch you all swallow it.

732
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:35,527
— Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn.
— (crowd shouting)

733
00:48:35,611 --> 00:48:39,673
Escort the prisoner
back to his cell.

734
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:44,095
I will not give my life
for Joffrey's murder.

735
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:47,348
<i>And I know I'll get</i>
<i>no justice here.</i>

736
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:50,634
So I will let
the gods decide my fate.

737
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:55,523
I demand a trial by combat.

738
