The wolf pup has gone south.

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:04,764
The North is ripe for
the taking.

3
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:08,202
You'll take a ship to raid the
fishing villages on the Stony Shore

4
00:00:08,203 --> 00:00:10,856
- I'm to fight fishermen?
- Be careful of their nets.

5
00:00:11,326 --> 00:00:13,361
- Lovely boy.
- What do you want?

6
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:14,863
You're called Arry?

7
00:00:14,897 --> 00:00:16,798
<i>A boy could make a friend.</i>

8
00:00:16,832 --> 00:00:19,200
This man has the honor
to be Jaqen H'ghar.

00:00:19,234 --> 00:00:20,968
<i>Every night it's the same.</i>

10
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:23,938
<i>I'm running through</i>
<i>the Godswood howling.</i>

11
00:00:23,973 --> 00:00:25,740
These are dreams,
nothing more.

12
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:27,943
My dreams are different.
Mine are true.

13
00:00:27,977 --> 00:00:31,379
<i>I saw something take that child.</i>

14
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:34,949
Wildlings serve crueler
Gods than you or I.

15
00:00:34,984 --> 00:00:37,552
Ready my horse.
We leave at dawn.

16
00:00:37,586 --> 00:00:40,176
Did Cersei have you
knighted before or after

17
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:41,589
she took you into her bed?

18
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,024
- Nothing to say?
- Mercy! Mercy, My Lord!

19
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:47,461
I want to know what Cersei is
doing and you will tell me.

20
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:48,929
Yes, My Lord, I will.

21
00:00:48,963 --> 00:00:50,898
Sweet boy!
Help us!

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,001
<i>Round up any survivors.</i>

23
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:56,037
<i>We'll take them</i>
<i>back to Harrenhal.</i>

24
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:58,740
This one's a girl
dressed as a boy.

25
00:00:58,774 --> 00:01:01,242
Get these prisoners to work.
Bring the girl.

26
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:03,077
I need a new cupbearer.

27
00:01:03,112 --> 00:01:05,480
I will give you this
one night to reconsider.

28
00:01:05,514 --> 00:01:06,581
<i>Otherwise I shall</i>
<i>destroy you.</i>

29
00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:08,583
Look to your sins,
Lord Renly.

30
00:01:08,617 --> 00:01:10,952
<i>The night is dark</i>
<i>and full of terrors.</i>

31
00:01:10,986 --> 00:01:14,422
I will vouch for her,
her people and her dragons.

32
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:17,926
Be it on your head.

33
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,862
Welcome to Qarth, My Lady.

34
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,897
Trust you've not forgotten
your smuggler's tricks.

35
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:25,433

- <i>The red woman.</i>

- You swear it?

41
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:51,273
My son has no interest
in the Iron Throne.

42
00:03:56,914 --> 00:03:59,950
Then I see no reason
for hostility between us.

43
00:03:59,984 --> 00:04:02,686
Your son can go on calling
himself King in the North,

44
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,257
the Starks will have dominion over
all lands north of Moat Cailin,

45
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,393
provided he swears me
an oath of fealty.

46
00:04:08,427 --> 00:04:09,727
And the wording
of this oath?

47
00:04:09,762 --> 00:04:12,530
The same Ned Stark swore
to Robert 18 years ago.

48
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:18,303
Cat, their friendship held
the kingdoms together.

49
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:25,444
And in return
for my son's loyalty?

50
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:28,614
In the morning I'll destroy
my brother's army.

51
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:30,115
When that's done,

52
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,551
Baratheon and Stark
will fight

53
00:04:32,585 --> 00:04:34,420
their common enemy
together,

54
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:36,722
as they have done
many times before.

55
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:46,200
Our two houses
have always been close,

56
00:04:46,234 --> 00:04:50,037
which is why I am begging you
to reconsider this battle.

57
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:51,671
Negotiate a peace
with your brother.

58
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:54,440
Negotiate with Stannis?

59
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:56,242
You heard him out there.

60
00:04:56,276 --> 00:04:59,245
I'd have better luck
debating the wind.

61
00:05:01,014 --> 00:05:03,782
Please bring my terms
to your son.

62
00:05:03,817 --> 00:05:06,117
I believe we are
natural allies.

63
00:05:06,152 --> 00:05:07,786
I hope he feels
the same.

64
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,689
Together we could end
this war in a fortnight.

65
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,675
No!

66
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:33,513
- No.
<i>- Follow me!</i>

67
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:39,485
- You'll die for this.
- No, wait, it wasn't her!

- You'll-.
- No, wa-

69
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,332
We've got to leave.

70
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:28,667
They'll hang you
for this.

71
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:31,804
<i>- Inside the King's tent, go!</i>
- Now!

72
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:34,874
I won't leave him.

73
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:39,279
You can't avenge him
if you're dead.

74
00:06:40,314 --> 00:06:42,549
<i>Over there, go!</i>

75
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,818
Not that way.

76
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:21,123
We need to go home.

77
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:24,159
- Loras.
- My Lord, My Lady.

78
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,694
Get out.

79
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:27,896
Stannis will be here
in an hour.

80
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,699
When he arrives, Renly's
bannermen will flock to him.

81
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,935
<i>Your former companions</i>
<i>will fight for the privilege</i>

82
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:35,470
of selling you
to their new king.

83
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:37,372
And you want that
privilege for yourself.

84
00:07:37,407 --> 00:07:40,809
You will note that I am
standing here talking to you,

85
00:07:40,844 --> 00:07:43,012
- not Stannis.
- There's no time for this.

86
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,514
Ride back to
Highgarden, sister.

87
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,616
I'm not running
from Stannis.

88
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:47,885
<i>Brienne of Tarth</i>
<i>murdered Renly.</i>

89
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,221
I don't believe that.
You don't believe that.

90
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,325
Who gained the most
from our king's death?

91
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:57,327
Stannis.

92
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:59,261
I will put a sword
through his righteous face.

93
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:01,564
You can't stay here.

94
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:04,233
He would have been
a true king,

95
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:06,569
a good king.

96
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:08,438
<i>Tell me, Ser Loras,</i>

97
00:08:08,472 --> 00:08:11,074
what do you desire
most in this world?

98
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:12,942
Revenge.

99
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:15,611
I have always found that to
be the purest of motivations,

100
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:19,181
but you won't have a chance to
put your sword through Stannis,

101
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:20,782
<i>not today.</i>

102
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:23,017
<i>You'll be cut to pieces before</i>
<i>he sets foot on solid ground.</i>

103
00:08:23,051 --> 00:08:25,286
If it is justice
that you want,

104
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,753
be smart about it.

105
00:08:26,788 --> 00:08:29,289
You can't avenge him
from the grave.

106
00:08:31,058 --> 00:08:33,393
Bring the horses.

107
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,598
Please.

108
00:09:05,997 --> 00:09:07,498
He was very handsome.

109
00:09:07,532 --> 00:09:10,066
He was, Your Grace.

110
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:12,235
"Your Grace."

111
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:16,172
Calling yourself king
doesn't make you one.

112
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:19,508
And if Renly wasn't a king,
I wasn't a queen.

113
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:22,944
Do you want to be a queen?

114
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,080
No.

115
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:28,916
I want to be <i>the</i> queen.

116
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:42,733
Killed?
By whom?

117
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:44,335
<i>Accounts differ.</i>

118
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:47,071
Most seem to implicate
Catelyn Stark in some way.

119
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:48,873
Really?
Who'd have thought?

120
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:51,074
Some say it was one
of his own Kingsguard,

121
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:54,010
while still others say it was
Stannis himself who did it

122
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:56,012
after negotiations
went sour.

123
00:09:56,046 --> 00:09:58,080
Whomever did it,
I say well done.

124
00:09:58,115 --> 00:09:59,548
It's not what Varys says.

125
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,218
He says Renly's army is
<i>flocking to support Stannis,</i>

126
00:10:02,252 --> 00:10:06,188
which would give Stannis superiority
over us on both land and sea.

127
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:08,723
Littlefinger says we can
outspend him three to one.

128
00:10:08,758 --> 00:10:11,593
And I say father raised you to
have too much respect for money.

129
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:13,995
<i>Stannis Baratheon</i>
<i>is coming for us,</i>

130
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,430
sooner rather than later.

131
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:16,832
Aren't there other things
you should be doing,

132
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,101
like sealing my daughter in a crate
so you can ship her away?

133
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:20,473
She'll be safer in Dorne.

134
00:10:20,498 --> 00:10:22,205
Yes, I know how concerned
you are for her safety.

135
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,040
It so happens that I am.

136
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:25,809
Myrcella is a sweet,
innocent girl

137
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:27,744
and I don't blame her
at all for you.

138
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:30,380
So clever.

139
00:10:30,415 --> 00:10:32,883
Aren't you
always so clever

140
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:35,185
with your schemes
and your plots?

141
00:10:36,354 --> 00:10:38,254
Schemes and plots
are the same thing.

142
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:40,290
They are going
to attack us.

143
00:10:40,324 --> 00:10:41,924
We need to be ready.

144
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:44,426
No need to concern
yourself over it.

145
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:47,796
The King is taking personal
charge of siege preparations.

146
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:51,466
May I ask specifically
what the King has in mind?

147
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,936
You may specifically
or you may ask vaguely.

148
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,204
The answer will be
the same.

149
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:04,680
It's important
that we talk about this.

150
00:11:06,984 --> 00:11:09,586
It's the King's
royal prerogative

151
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,557
to withhold sensitive information
from his councilors.

152
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,235
<i>It's wildfire.</i>

153
00:11:24,303 --> 00:11:26,004
Wildfire?

154
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:30,109
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you, cousin?

155
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:32,878
- No.
- That's a lie right there.

156
00:11:32,912 --> 00:11:35,080
It is not a lie.
Why would I lie?

157
00:11:35,115 --> 00:11:37,382
Tell me,

158
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:39,118
if the vile allegations

159
00:11:39,152 --> 00:11:41,687
against my brother
and sister are true,

160
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:44,089
do you think it will
make Jaime more likely

161
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:46,458
to kill you or less likely?

162
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:49,179
When I tell him
you're fucking her, I mean.

163
00:11:49,204 --> 00:11:50,962
I'm telling you the truth.

164
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:52,515
The smart money
would be on more likely.

165
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,098
She's making wildfire.

166
00:11:54,099 --> 00:11:56,734
But then perhaps his own unnatural
urges will give him sympathy for yours.

167
00:11:56,768 --> 00:11:58,202
The alchemists' guild
is being commissioned.

168
00:11:58,236 --> 00:11:59,937
I suppose there's only
one way to find out.

169
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:02,572
They have thousands of pots
already stored in their vaults.

170
00:12:02,607 --> 00:12:04,741
They are planning to launch
them from the city walls

171
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:06,576
into Stannis's ships
and armies.

172
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,245
<i>Please.</i>

173
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,147
When did she
tell you this?

174
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:15,652
I heard her talking
with the Pyromancer.

175
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:19,523
And the other night
after I left her,

176
00:12:19,557 --> 00:12:21,826
she went to meet him.

177
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,796
- I swear to you.
- Swear to me on what?

178
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,566
- On my life.
- But I don't care about your life.

179
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,602
In the Light of the Seven,

180
00:12:29,636 --> 00:12:31,637
by all that is
holy and right,

181
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:34,139
I, Lancel Lannister,
do solemnly vow--

182
00:12:34,173 --> 00:12:35,569
All right, all right.
Enough.

183
00:12:35,594 --> 00:12:37,594
Even torturing
you is boring.

184
00:12:37,943 --> 00:12:40,545
<i>Just get out.</i>

185
00:12:43,581 --> 00:12:45,148
Oh, Lancel,
tell my friend Bronn

186
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:48,185
to please kill you if anything
should happen to me.

187
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:51,287
Please kill me if anything
should happen to Lord Tyrion.

188
00:12:53,457 --> 00:12:55,591
It will be my pleasure.

189
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,197
- Your Grace.
- What is it?

190
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:03,051
Your Grace.

191
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:05,033
I'm sorry about
your brother, Your Grace.

192
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,513
I wanted to let you know
that people grieve for him.

193
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:08,169
Your Grace.

194
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,971
- Fools love a fool.
- Your Grace.

195
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:12,641
I grieve for him as well--
for the boy he was,

196
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:14,310
not the man
he grew to be.

197
00:13:14,344 --> 00:13:16,479
I need to speak to you about
what I saw in that cave.

198
00:13:16,513 --> 00:13:18,075
I thought I made it clear
to you there'd be no need to

199
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,192
speak to me on this matter.

200
00:13:19,193 --> 00:13:20,022
Your Grace, I--

201
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:22,047
I've never known you to
need to hear a thing twice.

202
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:26,256
And I've never known you
to hide from the truth.

203
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:27,792
You've come to lecture
me on truth?

204
00:13:27,826 --> 00:13:29,527
I've come to tell you
that what I saw--

205
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:31,662
All my brother's bannermen
have come to my side.

206
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:36,733
Except the Tyrells,
who fled like cowards.

207
00:13:36,768 --> 00:13:38,568
They won't be able
to resist us now.

208
00:13:38,602 --> 00:13:40,470
Soon I shall be sitting
on the Iron Throne.

209
00:13:40,504 --> 00:13:42,338
Nothing is worth
what this will cost you,

210
00:13:42,372 --> 00:13:44,807
- not even the Iron--
- I'll hear no more about it.

211
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:55,118
<i>Take a company of men,</i>
<i>secure the perimeter.</i>

212
00:13:55,152 --> 00:13:57,988
When do we sail
for King's Landing?

213
00:13:58,022 --> 00:14:00,424
As soon as I've
consolidated my troops.

214
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,326
We'll make short work
of the Lannisters' fleet.

215
00:14:02,361 --> 00:14:04,395
Once Blackwater Bay
is cleared,

216
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,532
we'll deliver our troops to their
doorstep and take the city.

217
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:11,269
And will you bring
Lady Melisandre with you?

218
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:14,372
That's not your concern.

219
00:14:14,406 --> 00:14:17,875
If you take King's Landing with her
by your side, the victory will be hers.

220
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:20,277
I never thought I'd have reason to
doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?

221
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:23,213
Loyal service means
telling hard truths.

222
00:14:23,248 --> 00:14:25,582
Oh, truth again.

223
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:28,718
All right,
what's the truth?

224
00:14:28,753 --> 00:14:30,687
The hard truth?

225
00:14:30,721 --> 00:14:32,656
<i>She's a foreigner</i>

226
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,791
preaching her
foreign religion.

227
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:39,062
Some believe she whispers orders
in your ear and you obey.

228
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:43,767
What do you believe?

229
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:50,842
You won those bannermen
from Renly.

230
00:14:50,877 --> 00:14:52,944
Don't lose them to her.

231
00:14:57,883 --> 00:15:00,718
We set out for King's Landing
without Lady Melisandre.

232
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:06,389
And you lead the fleet
into Blackwater Bay.

233
00:15:06,424 --> 00:15:08,958
Your Grace, I'm honored,
but my time on the sea

234
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,627
was spent evading ships,
not attacking them.

235
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,428
The other lords
won't be happy.

236
00:15:13,463 --> 00:15:16,498
Most of those lords should
consider themselves lucky

237
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:18,600
I don't hang them
for treason.

238
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:24,239
Hard truths cut
both ways, Ser Davos.

239
00:15:41,157 --> 00:15:41,189
<i>I've got it!</i>
<i>I've got it!</i>

240
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:46,327
<i>So it's that one there</i>
<i>at the top, on the right.</i>

241
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:50,498
Buy my fruit, My Lord.
Fresh fruit.

242
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,333
Stannis has more infantry,

243
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:54,235
more ships, more horses.

244
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,971
What do we have?

245
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:58,540
There's that mind of yours
you keep going on about.

246
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:01,910
Well, I've never actually been
able to kill people with it.

247
00:16:01,944 --> 00:16:04,813
Good thing.
I'd be out of a job.

248
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:07,082
<i>What about your father?</i>

249
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:10,452
He hasn't sent
a raven in weeks.

250
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:12,054
He's very busy.

251
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:15,957
Being repeatedly humiliated by
Robb Stark is time-consuming.

252
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:18,359
We won't be able to hold
the city against Stannis,

253
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,228
not the way Joffrey's
planning on holding it.

254
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:22,430
Corruption, yes.

255
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:27,367
We are swollen,
bloated, foul.

256
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:30,771
Brother fornicates with sister
in the bed of Kings

257
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:33,707
and we're surprised when the
fruit of their incest is rotten?

258
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:37,878
Yes, a rotten king.

259
00:16:37,912 --> 00:16:40,414
It's hard to argue
with his assessment.

260
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:43,050
Not after what he did
to your birthday present.

261
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:45,786
The King is a lost cause.

262
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,055
It's the rest of us
I'm worried about now.

263
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:51,926
A dancing king, prancing
down his bloodstained halls

264
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,863
to the tune of a twisted
demon monkey.

265
00:16:57,032 --> 00:16:59,934
You have to admire
his imagination.

266
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:03,337
- He's talking about you.
- What?

267
00:17:03,372 --> 00:17:05,306
Demon monkey?

268
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:07,442
People think you're pulling
the King's strings.

269
00:17:07,476 --> 00:17:09,678
They blame you
for the city's ills.

270
00:17:09,712 --> 00:17:12,547
Blame me?
I'm trying to save them.

271
00:17:12,581 --> 00:17:15,583
You don't need
to convince me.

272
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,186
Demon monkey.

273
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,388
<i>( Seagulls screeching</i>

274
00:17:47,284 --> 00:17:48,884
Yeah, come on.

275
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:50,486
You're the crew
of the sea bitch?

276
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,256
I'm your commander.
Welcome.

277
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:57,893
Stop.

278
00:17:57,927 --> 00:18:00,228
Stop!

279
00:18:00,263 --> 00:18:03,431
Your Captain commands
you to stop.

280
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:06,468
Where are we
heading, Captain?

281
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,272
The Stony Shore
to raid their villages.

282
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:13,675
<i>There'll be spoils</i>
<i>in it for you, and women,</i>

283
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:15,244
if you do your jobs well.

284
00:18:15,278 --> 00:18:18,548
And who decides if we've
done our jobs well?

285
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:22,018
I do.

286
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:24,087
Your Captain.

287
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,626
I have been reaving
and raping

288
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,697
since before you left
Balon's balls, Captain.

289
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:36,868
Don't reckon I've got much use
for your ideas on how to do it.

290
00:18:36,902 --> 00:18:40,338
Don't reckon I've got
much use for a captain at all.

291
00:18:40,372 --> 00:18:44,376
I'm thinking I can do the job
of captain real well myself.

292
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,511
All I need is a ship.

293
00:18:46,545 --> 00:18:48,767
You wouldn't know
where I could find myself

294
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,792
a ship now, would you?

295
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,654
You could do that,

296
00:18:56,688 --> 00:18:59,056
take the ship,
head out on your own.

297
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,530
And I will hunt you down,
drag you back here in chains,

298
00:19:01,555 --> 00:19:03,093
and hang you for a traitor.

299
00:19:03,094 --> 00:19:05,696
Stop. We yield.

300
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:11,902
Congratulations
on your first command.

301
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:14,672
Thank you. Kind of you
to come see me off.

302
00:19:14,706 --> 00:19:16,173
Oh, I'm not here
for you.

303
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,209
I was just on my way
to Red Harbor.

304
00:19:19,244 --> 00:19:23,014
I've got 30 ships. There's
nowhere to put them here.

305
00:19:23,048 --> 00:19:26,316
- Too narrow.
- You'd better get out there.

306
00:19:26,351 --> 00:19:28,385
Wouldn't want them
to set sail without you.

307
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:30,287
That would never happen.

308
00:19:30,322 --> 00:19:34,324
My crew would wait on deck
for a year if I asked them to.

309
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,860
This lot, though...

310
00:19:38,363 --> 00:19:41,098
Enjoy the Stony Shore.

311
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,071
Come on,
I'll take you out.

312
00:19:48,106 --> 00:19:49,907
Who are you?

313
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:52,009
Dagmer, your first mate.

314
00:19:53,211 --> 00:19:55,313
Why aren't you with
the rest of them?

315
00:19:55,347 --> 00:19:59,417
Or did they send you to row me
out and dump me halfway in the sea?

316
00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:00,852
That would be good
for a laugh.

317
00:20:00,886 --> 00:20:03,755
They're not gonna respect you
until you prove yourself.

318
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,616
And how am I supposed
to prove myself by pillaging

319
00:20:05,641 --> 00:20:07,226
piss-poor fishing villages?

320
00:20:07,227 --> 00:20:09,294
You're not.

321
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:11,497
And yet that's the task
my father has given me

322
00:20:11,531 --> 00:20:14,900
to prove that
I'm a true Iron Islander.

323
00:20:14,934 --> 00:20:17,202
<i>They're all Iron Islanders.</i>

324
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:20,706
Do they do as they're told
or do they do as they like?

325
00:20:27,747 --> 00:20:30,715
The Stony Shore's not far
from Torrhen's Square.

326
00:20:30,749 --> 00:20:33,385
The seat of the House
of Tallhart--

327
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,321
a more impressive prize than
a few fishermen's daughters.

328
00:20:37,924 --> 00:20:39,615
What, you don't think
we could take it?

329
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,793
No, we could.

330
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:42,996
We could never hold it
for more than a few days.

331
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,398
As soon as Winterfell got word that
we'd taken Torrhen's Square,

332
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:48,235
the Starks would send
their men to take it back.

333
00:20:49,771 --> 00:20:52,406
And then--

334
00:20:57,345 --> 00:20:59,780
take me to my ship.

335
00:21:03,918 --> 00:21:06,920
The Starks have
overextended their lines.

336
00:21:06,955 --> 00:21:09,022
Now that summer's over,
they'll have a hard time

337
00:21:09,057 --> 00:21:11,124
keeping their men
and horses fed.

338
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:13,260
The Starks understand winter
better than we ever will.

339
00:21:13,295 --> 00:21:14,996
The cold won't beat them.

340
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:19,634
Our spies report growing
discontent among the northern lords.

341
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:21,168
They want to return home

342
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:23,837
and gather the harvest
before the crops turn.

343
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:27,277
And I'm sure if those same spies
snuck into our own encampments,

344
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:30,481
they would report growing discontent
amongst the southern lords.

345
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:33,383
This is war;
No one's content.

346
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,355
We've underestimated
the Stark boy for too long.

347
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,725
He has a good mind for warfare,
his men worship him.

348
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,861
And as long as he keeps
winning battles,

349
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:47,798
they'll keep believing
he is King in the North.

350
00:21:47,832 --> 00:21:49,467
You've been waiting
for him to fail.

351
00:21:49,501 --> 00:21:52,036
He is not going to fail,

352
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,039
not without our help.

353
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:58,709
So how do we stop him?

354
00:21:58,744 --> 00:22:01,112
<i>We've worked through</i>
<i>the night, My Lord.</i>

355
00:22:01,146 --> 00:22:03,447
Perhaps we'd profit
from some sleep.

356
00:22:03,482 --> 00:22:05,516
As I think
you would, Reginald.

357
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:07,118
And because
you're my cousin,

358
00:22:07,152 --> 00:22:09,887
I might even let you
wake from that sleep.

359
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:13,458
Go, I'm sure your wife
must miss you.

360
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:15,226
My wife's in Lannisport.

361
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,462
Well, then you'd
better start riding.

362
00:22:18,897 --> 00:22:22,501
Go before I change my mind
and send her your head.

363
00:22:22,535 --> 00:22:24,903
If your name
wasn't Lannister,

364
00:22:24,938 --> 00:22:28,507
you'd be scrubbing out pots
in the cook's tent. Go!

365
00:22:31,377 --> 00:22:33,045
Not wine, water.

366
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:35,247
We'll be here
for some time.

367
00:22:40,153 --> 00:22:42,888
Girl.

368
00:22:42,923 --> 00:22:44,924
Where are you from?

369
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,826
Maidenpool, My Lord.

370
00:22:46,861 --> 00:22:50,230
And who are the Lords
of Maidenpool?

371
00:22:50,264 --> 00:22:54,134
- Remind me.
- House Mooton, My Lord.

372
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:56,203
And what is their Sigil?

373
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,143
A red salmon.

374
00:23:02,177 --> 00:23:05,313
I think a Maidenpool girl
would remember that.

375
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:08,450
You're a northerner,
aren't you?

376
00:23:09,652 --> 00:23:12,720
Good. One more time,
where are you from?

377
00:23:12,755 --> 00:23:15,723
Barrowton, My Lord.
House Dustin.

378
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:19,828
Two crossed longaxes
beneath a black crown.

379
00:23:21,764 --> 00:23:25,400
And what do they say
of Robb Stark in the North?

380
00:23:27,736 --> 00:23:30,371
They call him
the young wolf.

381
00:23:30,406 --> 00:23:32,841
And?

382
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:35,677
They say he rides into battle on
the back of a giant Direwolf.

383
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:41,984
They say he can turn into
a wolf himself when he wants.

384
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,987
They say he can't be killed.

385
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:46,924
And do you believe them?

386
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,828
No, My Lord.

387
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:52,997
Anyone can be killed.

388
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,340
Fetch that water.

389
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:45,484
A girl says nothing.

390
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,355
A girl keeps
her mouth closed.

391
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:53,025
<i>No one hears,</i>

392
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:56,929
and friends may talk
in secret, yes?

393
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,735
A boy becomes a girl.

394
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,371
I was always a girl.

395
00:25:04,405 --> 00:25:06,607
And I was always aware.

396
00:25:06,641 --> 00:25:09,343
But the girl
keeps secrets.

397
00:25:09,378 --> 00:25:12,379
<i>It is not for a man</i>
<i>to spoil them.</i>

398
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:16,016
You're one of them now.

399
00:25:18,552 --> 00:25:21,220
I should have let you burn.

400
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:25,790
And you fetch water
for one of them now.

401
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:29,860
Why is this right for you
and wrong for me?

402
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,596
I didn't have a choice.

403
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,700
You did.
I did.

404
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,369
And here we are.

405
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:42,407
A man pays his debts.

406
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:44,776
A man owes three.

407
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,077
Three what?

408
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:50,549
The Red God takes
what is his, lovely girl.

409
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:53,652
And only death
may pay for life.

410
00:25:54,788 --> 00:25:57,289
You saved me
and the two I was with.

411
00:25:57,324 --> 00:26:00,226
You stole three deaths
from the Red God.

412
00:26:03,797 --> 00:26:05,965
We have to give them back.

413
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:11,303
Speak three names

414
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:13,906
and the man
will do the rest.

415
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:17,643
Three lives
I will give you--

416
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:21,013
no more, no less,
and we're done.

417
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:23,548
I can name anyone

418
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,884
and you'll kill him?

419
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:29,588
A man has said.

420
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:33,158
The one who
tortures everyone.

421
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,892
A man needs a name.

422
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,261
I don't know his name.

423
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,297
They call him
the Tickler.

424
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,498
That is enough.

425
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:45,635
Go now, girl.
Your master is thirsty.

426
00:26:58,983 --> 00:27:00,416
<i>He's not here yet.</i>

427
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:02,886
He'd have seen us,
blown the horn.

428
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,088
When will he come?

429
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,124
The Halfhand does things
in his own time.

430
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,426
My uncle told me
stories about him.

431
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,495
Most of them are true.

432
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,198
I heard the Halfhand spent half
of last winter beyond the wall.

433
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,766
The whole winter.

434
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,468
He was north of the Skirling Pass
when the snows came.

435
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,170
Had to wait for the thaw.

436
00:27:20,204 --> 00:27:24,173
So it is possible for someone
to survive out here on their own.

437
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:27,610
Well, possible
for the Halfhand.

438
00:27:27,644 --> 00:27:29,445
Beautiful, isn't it?

439
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,013
Gilly would love it here.

440
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:35,650
There's nothing more sickening
than a man in love.

441
00:28:03,077 --> 00:28:05,378
<i>About time you did something.</i>

442
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:08,180
<i>At least you'll keep warm.</i>

443
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,418
The fist
of the First Men.

444
00:28:12,453 --> 00:28:15,956
Think of how old
this place is--

445
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,559
before the Targaryens
defeated the Hendals,

446
00:28:18,593 --> 00:28:21,362
before the Andals took
Westeros from the First Men.

447
00:28:21,396 --> 00:28:24,565
Before I die, please,
stop talking.

448
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,835
Thousands and thousands
of years ago,

449
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:29,939
the First Men stood here
where we're standing

450
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:32,274
all through the long night.

451
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:36,745
What do you think they
were like, the First Men?

452
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,380
Stupid.

453
00:28:38,414 --> 00:28:41,584
Smart people don't find
themselves in places like this.

454
00:28:41,618 --> 00:28:44,153
I think
they were afraid.

455
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:48,224
I think they came here
to get away from something.

456
00:28:48,258 --> 00:28:51,794
And I don't think
it worked.

457
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:57,266
Wildlings?

458
00:28:59,636 --> 00:29:02,004
One blast is for rangers returning.

459
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,706
Wildlings is two blasts.

460
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,209
So you got to stand
there waiting,

461
00:29:07,243 --> 00:29:09,310
<i>wondering.</i>

462
00:29:09,345 --> 00:29:10,979
<i>One blast for friends,</i>

463
00:29:11,014 --> 00:29:13,916
<i>two for foes.</i>

464
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:21,257
And three
for White Walkers.

465
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,193
It's been 1,000 years,

466
00:29:23,227 --> 00:29:25,963
but that's the only time
they blow the horn three times.

467
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:29,099
But if it's been 1,000 years,
how do you know?

468
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:32,835
- Well...
- I read it in a book.

469
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,971
Look.

470
00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:38,273
It's Qhorin Halfhand.

471
00:29:38,308 --> 00:29:41,510
Aye, we'll live
another day.

472
00:29:41,544 --> 00:29:44,112
Hurrah.

473
00:29:53,455 --> 00:29:56,324
Take care, My Lord.

474
00:29:56,358 --> 00:29:59,327
I remember reading
an old sailor's proverb--

475
00:29:59,361 --> 00:30:02,297
"piss on wildfire
and your cock burns off."

476
00:30:02,332 --> 00:30:05,968
Oh, I have not conducted
this experiment.

477
00:30:06,002 --> 00:30:08,604
It could well be true.

478
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:10,473
The substance
burns so hot,

479
00:30:10,507 --> 00:30:13,642
it melts wood,
stone, even steel,

480
00:30:13,677 --> 00:30:16,979
and, of course, flesh.

481
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:21,516
The substance burns so hot,
it melts flesh like tallow.

482
00:30:24,853 --> 00:30:28,189
After the dragons died,
wildfire was the key

483
00:30:28,223 --> 00:30:29,991
to the Targaryen power.

484
00:30:30,025 --> 00:30:33,061
My companion takes issue.

485
00:30:33,095 --> 00:30:35,430
If I could tell you
how many crazy old men

486
00:30:35,464 --> 00:30:37,599
I've seen pushing carts
around army camps

487
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:41,336
making grand claims about
jars full of pig shit...

488
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:44,606
- No offense meant.
- Our order does not deal in pig shit.

489
00:30:44,641 --> 00:30:47,342
The substance
is fire given form.

490
00:30:47,376 --> 00:30:50,945
And we have been perfecting it
since the days of Maegor.

491
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,313
To do what?

492
00:30:52,348 --> 00:30:55,750
The jars are put in catapults
and flung at the enemy.

493
00:30:55,784 --> 00:30:58,452
How much do you have?

494
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:05,124
If you could get real soldiers
to man the catapults,

495
00:31:05,158 --> 00:31:08,526
then maybe you'd hit
your target one time in 10,

496
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:11,695
but all the real soldiers are in
the Riverlands with your father.

497
00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:14,364
My Lord, this man
is insulting.

498
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,700
I don't know if you've
ever seen a battle, old man,

499
00:31:16,735 --> 00:31:18,369
but things can get
a bit messy.

500
00:31:18,403 --> 00:31:19,770
'Cause when we're flinging
things at Stannis,

501
00:31:19,804 --> 00:31:21,572
he's flinging them
right back at us.

502
00:31:21,606 --> 00:31:24,441
Men die, men shit
themselves, men run,

503
00:31:24,475 --> 00:31:26,209
which means
pots falling,

504
00:31:26,244 --> 00:31:28,144
which means fire
inside the walls,

505
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:30,445
which means the poor cunts
trying to defend the city

506
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,470
end up burning it down.

507
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,050
My friend remains
unconvinced.

508
00:31:35,084 --> 00:31:37,419
He would not dare
insult my order

509
00:31:37,453 --> 00:31:39,153
whilst Aerys Targaryen
lived.

510
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,789
Well, he's not
living anymore.

511
00:31:41,823 --> 00:31:44,925
And all his pots of wildfire
didn't help him, did they?

512
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,929
Men win wars,
not magic tricks.

513
00:32:04,243 --> 00:32:08,512
We have been working
tirelessly day and night

514
00:32:08,547 --> 00:32:13,016
ever since your royal sister
commanded us to do so.

515
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,185
Our present count stands

516
00:32:15,219 --> 00:32:18,721
at 7,811,

517
00:32:18,755 --> 00:32:22,224
enough to burn Stannis
Baratheon's fleet

518
00:32:22,258 --> 00:32:24,359
and armies both.

519
00:32:24,394 --> 00:32:27,095
This is a shit idea.

520
00:32:27,129 --> 00:32:30,998
I'm afraid I have to concur
with my advisor, wisdom Hallyne.

521
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:35,269
The contents of this room
could lay King's Landing low.

522
00:32:36,905 --> 00:32:40,640
You won't be making wildfire
for my sister any longer.

523
00:32:42,243 --> 00:32:44,878
You'll be making it
for me.

524
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:56,023
Dracarys.

525
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:06,000
Dracarys.

526
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:18,447
He'll be able to feed
himself from now on.

527
00:33:21,784 --> 00:33:24,352
<i>Let him sleep, Doreah.</i>

528
00:33:24,387 --> 00:33:27,156
Yes, Khaleesi.

529
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:31,327
He loves you.

530
00:33:42,206 --> 00:33:44,408
Thank you, my friend.

531
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:49,580
Did you see the dress
Xaro had made for you?

532
00:33:49,614 --> 00:33:52,649
They say he's the
wealthiest man in Qarth.

533
00:33:52,683 --> 00:33:54,918
It is known.

534
00:33:54,953 --> 00:33:57,955
And if Qarth is the wealthiest
city in Essos--

535
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,890
The last time a rich man
gave me a dress,

536
00:33:59,924 --> 00:34:02,659
he was selling me
to Khal Drogo.

537
00:34:08,432 --> 00:34:12,035
Xaro is our host,
but we know nothing about him.

538
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:14,838
Men like to talk
about other men

539
00:34:14,872 --> 00:34:16,874
when they're happy.

540
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:26,517
You would look like
a real princess in Xaro's--

541
00:34:26,552 --> 00:34:29,588
She's not a princess.
She's a Khaleesi.

542
00:34:35,561 --> 00:34:37,862
You should wear it,
Khaleesi.

543
00:34:37,896 --> 00:34:39,363
You are their guest.

544
00:34:39,397 --> 00:34:41,999
It would be rude not to.

545
00:35:02,354 --> 00:35:04,222
And you must visit
the night market.

546
00:35:04,256 --> 00:35:09,094
The Qartheen night market is like
no night market you've ever seen.

547
00:35:09,129 --> 00:35:10,997
It sounds wonderful.

548
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:12,999
The Meereens think
they have a night market.

549
00:35:13,034 --> 00:35:15,301
I will take you
there myself.

550
00:35:15,335 --> 00:35:18,771
Please excuse me
for a moment.

551
00:35:21,175 --> 00:35:23,510
What are they doing?

552
00:35:23,544 --> 00:35:27,280
Malakko says the statue
is too heavy to carry.

553
00:35:27,315 --> 00:35:28,649
Kovarro says that
Malakko is an idiot.

554
00:35:28,683 --> 00:35:31,385
<i>They can pry out the gems,</i>
<i>the rest is pure gold.</i>

555
00:35:31,419 --> 00:35:35,022
Very soft. He can chop off
as much as we can carry.

556
00:36:02,685 --> 00:36:05,553
My brother used to say the only
thing the Dothraki knew how to do

557
00:36:05,587 --> 00:36:07,622
was steal things
better men have built.

558
00:36:07,656 --> 00:36:09,357
It's not the only thing.

559
00:36:09,391 --> 00:36:11,192
They're quite good
at killing the better men.

560
00:36:11,226 --> 00:36:14,228
That's not the kind of queen
I'm going to be.

561
00:36:14,262 --> 00:36:17,131
Mother of Dragons.

562
00:36:17,165 --> 00:36:19,367
On behalf of the warlocks
of Qarth,

563
00:36:19,401 --> 00:36:21,502
I welcome you.

564
00:36:22,737 --> 00:36:24,738
A demonstration?

565
00:36:26,708 --> 00:36:29,877
Take this gem.
Look at it.

566
00:36:31,246 --> 00:36:33,647
Into its depths.

567
00:36:33,682 --> 00:36:36,016
So many facets.

568
00:36:36,051 --> 00:36:40,187
Look closely enough and you
can see yourself in them.

569
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,691
Often more than once.

570
00:36:47,862 --> 00:36:51,564
Should you grow tired of
Xaro's baubles and trinkets,

571
00:36:51,598 --> 00:36:54,934
it would be an honor to host you
at the House of the Undying.

572
00:36:54,968 --> 00:36:57,403
You're always welcome,

573
00:36:57,437 --> 00:37:00,106
Mother of Dragons.

574
00:37:06,647 --> 00:37:08,982
My apologies.

575
00:37:09,016 --> 00:37:11,584
Pyat Pree is one
of the Thirteen.

576
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:14,020
It was customary for me
to extend him an invitation.

577
00:37:14,054 --> 00:37:17,189
Customs die
slow deaths in Qarth.

578
00:37:17,223 --> 00:37:19,991
What is the House
of the Undying?

579
00:37:20,026 --> 00:37:23,628
It is where the warlocks go
to squint at dusty books

580
00:37:23,662 --> 00:37:25,229
and drink shade
of the evening.

581
00:37:25,264 --> 00:37:29,333
It turns their lips blue
and their minds soft--

582
00:37:29,367 --> 00:37:32,235
so soft,
they actually believe

583
00:37:32,269 --> 00:37:34,270
their parlor tricks
are magic.

584
00:37:37,942 --> 00:37:40,577
<i>You watch over her.</i>

585
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,148
Do I know you?

586
00:37:44,182 --> 00:37:46,084
I know you.

587
00:37:46,118 --> 00:37:49,654
Jorah Mormont
of Bear Island.

588
00:37:49,688 --> 00:37:51,423
Who are you?

589
00:37:51,457 --> 00:37:53,759
I'm no one.

590
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:55,761
But she is
the Mother of Dragons.

591
00:37:55,795 --> 00:37:59,398
She needs true protectors
now more than ever.

592
00:37:59,432 --> 00:38:01,400
They shall come
day and night

593
00:38:01,434 --> 00:38:03,936
to see the wonder born
into the world again.

594
00:38:03,971 --> 00:38:07,474
And when they see,
they shall lust,

595
00:38:07,508 --> 00:38:11,311
for dragons are fire
made flesh.

596
00:38:11,346 --> 00:38:13,947
And fire is power.

597
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:26,526
It looked like Stannis.

598
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,995
To me it just
looked like...

599
00:38:33,434 --> 00:38:36,102
A shadow in
the shape of a man.

600
00:38:36,136 --> 00:38:38,171
In the shape
of Stannis.

601
00:38:42,544 --> 00:38:45,246
We should reach
my son's camp tomorrow.

602
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,381
Will you stay there
long, My Lady?

603
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:51,085
Only long enough to tell
Robb what I have seen.

604
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,422
After that, I will leave
for Winterfell.

605
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,758
My two youngest need me.

606
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,927
I've been away from them
for far too long.

607
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:03,863
I never knew my mother.

608
00:39:04,898 --> 00:39:06,398
I'm sorry.

609
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:10,135
My own mother died
on the birthing bed

610
00:39:10,169 --> 00:39:13,004
when I was very young.

611
00:39:16,242 --> 00:39:18,777
It's a bloody business.

612
00:39:18,811 --> 00:39:22,347
What comes after
is even harder.

613
00:39:24,016 --> 00:39:27,152
Once you're safely back
amongst your own people,

614
00:39:27,186 --> 00:39:30,322
will you give me leave
to go, My Lady?

615
00:39:30,356 --> 00:39:32,558
You mean to kill Stannis.

616
00:39:32,592 --> 00:39:34,226
I swore a vow.

617
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,529
But Stannis has
a great army around him.

618
00:39:37,563 --> 00:39:40,065
His own guards are sworn
to keep him safe.

619
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:41,966
<i>I'm as good</i>
<i>as any of them.</i>

620
00:39:43,436 --> 00:39:44,869
I should never have fled.

621
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:48,639
Renly's death
was no fault of yours.

622
00:39:48,673 --> 00:39:50,507
You served him bravely.

623
00:39:50,542 --> 00:39:54,546
I only held him
that once

624
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,215
as he was dying.

625
00:39:59,685 --> 00:40:01,319
He's gone, Brienne.

626
00:40:01,354 --> 00:40:05,958
You serve nothing and no one
by following him into the earth.

627
00:40:07,227 --> 00:40:10,330
Renly's enemies are
Robb's enemies as well.

628
00:40:14,969 --> 00:40:17,003
I do not know
your son, My Lady...

629
00:40:19,206 --> 00:40:23,175
but I could serve you
if you would have me.

630
00:40:23,209 --> 00:40:25,277
<i>You have courage.</i>

631
00:40:25,311 --> 00:40:27,779
Not battle courage, perhaps,

632
00:40:27,813 --> 00:40:31,249
but, I don't know,

633
00:40:31,284 --> 00:40:33,184
a woman's kind of courage.

634
00:40:33,219 --> 00:40:35,721
<i>And I think that</i>
<i>when the time comes,</i>

635
00:40:35,755 --> 00:40:37,222
<i>you will not hold me back.</i>

636
00:40:37,257 --> 00:40:39,959
Promise me that you
will not hold me back

637
00:40:39,993 --> 00:40:42,328
from Stannis.

638
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,203
When the time comes,
I will not hold you back.

639
00:40:56,811 --> 00:40:59,145
Then I am yours,
My Lady.

640
00:41:00,247 --> 00:41:01,748
I will shield your back

641
00:41:01,782 --> 00:41:04,851
and give my life for yours
if it comes to that.

642
00:41:04,885 --> 00:41:08,487
I swear it by the Old Gods
and the new.

643
00:41:15,429 --> 00:41:18,999
I vow that you shall always
have a place in my home

644
00:41:19,034 --> 00:41:21,001
and at my table

645
00:41:21,035 --> 00:41:23,470
and that I shall ask
no service of you

646
00:41:23,505 --> 00:41:26,073
that might
bring you dishonor.

647
00:41:26,107 --> 00:41:29,176
I swear it by the Old Gods
and the new.

648
00:41:32,447 --> 00:41:34,647
<i>And it's not</i>
<i>just thieves, My Lord.</i>

649
00:41:34,983 --> 00:41:37,852
<i>There's wolves</i>
<i>in them hills now,</i>

650
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:40,187
more than I've ever seen.

651
00:41:40,222 --> 00:41:43,258
They come down in the night
and they kill my sheep.

652
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:47,128
My three sons is away fighting
for your brother, My Lord.

653
00:41:47,162 --> 00:41:49,363
They'll fight,
keep fighting

654
00:41:49,397 --> 00:41:51,532
till they're told
to go home.

655
00:41:51,566 --> 00:41:54,168
I have no one to man
my flock now. Only me.

656
00:41:54,202 --> 00:41:57,837
I can't keep watch
all day and all night.

657
00:41:59,874 --> 00:42:02,675
We can send two orphan boys
from Winterstown home with you

658
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,443
to help watch over
your flock

659
00:42:04,478 --> 00:42:06,278
if you can give them
room and board.

660
00:42:06,313 --> 00:42:09,014
My wife always prayed
for more children.

661
00:42:09,048 --> 00:42:11,416
We'll look after them.
Thank you, My Lord.

662
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:14,787
And may the Gods
bless you and yours.

663
00:42:17,658 --> 00:42:19,793
Stop it.

664
00:42:19,827 --> 00:42:23,130
If that's everyone, I'm going
to go for a ride before dark.

665
00:42:23,164 --> 00:42:25,166
- Good.
- Hodor.

666
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,137
- Hodor.
Bran-- Lord Stark.

667
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,906
Torrhen's Square
is under siege.

668
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,608
Torrhen's Square is barely
40 leagues from here.

669
00:42:33,642 --> 00:42:36,711
<i>How can the Lannisters</i>
<i>strike so far north?</i>

670
00:42:36,746 --> 00:42:39,347
Might be a raiding party
led by the Mountain.

671
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:41,882
Might be Sellswords
paid by Tywin Lannister.

672
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:43,150
We have to help them.

673
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,685
Most of the fighting men
are away with Robb,

674
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,420
but I can gather
200 decent men.

675
00:42:46,454 --> 00:42:47,681
Do you need so many?

676
00:42:47,706 --> 00:42:49,223
If we can't protect
our own bannermen,

677
00:42:49,224 --> 00:42:52,026
why should
they protect us?

678
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,829
Go, Ser Rodrik.
Take the men you need.

679
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,331
Won't take long, My Lord.

680
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,166
Southerners don't
do well up here.

681
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:11,114
So, what does it mean?

682
00:43:11,148 --> 00:43:12,190
Ask your Maester Luwin.

683
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,369
He's the one studying
books all the time.

684
00:43:14,518 --> 00:43:17,854
I did ask him. He'd never
heard of a three-eyed raven.

685
00:43:17,888 --> 00:43:21,491
- Must not mean anything, then
- You're lying.

686
00:43:21,525 --> 00:43:24,293
You might be a little lord,
but don't you call me a liar.

687
00:43:24,327 --> 00:43:27,563
- You know what it means.
- I never said I didn't.

688
00:43:27,597 --> 00:43:29,531
You didn't give me
an honest answer.

689
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:32,568
That's not the same
as being a liar.

690
00:43:32,602 --> 00:43:34,203
Well, it's not far off.

691
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:38,341
So, you've been dreaming
of a three-eyed raven again?

692
00:43:39,777 --> 00:43:43,079
In the Godswood,
you told me you didn't dream.

693
00:43:43,114 --> 00:43:45,148
Now who's a liar?

694
00:43:48,919 --> 00:43:50,954
What did you see
in your dream?

695
00:43:53,391 --> 00:43:55,659
Something bad?

696
00:43:55,693 --> 00:43:57,894
Tell me, boy.

697
00:44:01,232 --> 00:44:04,167
I dreamt that the sea
came to Winterfell.

698
00:44:05,603 --> 00:44:08,070
I saw waves crashing
against the gates

699
00:44:08,105 --> 00:44:11,807
and the water came
flowing over the walls...

700
00:44:14,144 --> 00:44:16,646
<i>flooded the castle.</i>

701
00:44:18,849 --> 00:44:21,050
Drowned men
were floating here

702
00:44:21,084 --> 00:44:23,219
in the yard.

703
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:28,825
Ser Rodrik
was one of them.

704
00:44:30,861 --> 00:44:33,563
The sea is hundreds
of miles away.

705
00:44:33,598 --> 00:44:35,212
I know.

706
00:44:35,213 --> 00:44:36,538
It's just a stupid dream.

707
00:44:36,563 --> 00:44:38,434
I've got to get these
potatoes to the kitchen.

708
00:44:38,435 --> 00:44:39,936
Otherwise they'll put me
in chains again.

709
00:44:39,971 --> 00:44:42,372
Osha.

710
00:44:42,406 --> 00:44:44,875
The three-eyed raven,

711
00:44:44,909 --> 00:44:47,378
what do they say about it

712
00:44:47,413 --> 00:44:50,214
north of the wall?

713
00:44:50,249 --> 00:44:53,551
They say all sorts of crazy
things north of the wall.

714
00:45:04,697 --> 00:45:07,098
- There.
<i>- Where?</i>

715
00:45:07,132 --> 00:45:08,899
On that Mountain.

716
00:45:08,933 --> 00:45:11,401
I don't see very well.

717
00:45:11,436 --> 00:45:13,036
A fire.

718
00:45:15,307 --> 00:45:18,309
There's a fire.

719
00:45:18,343 --> 00:45:21,479
<i>The people sitting around it have</i>
<i>better eyes than yours or mine.</i>

720
00:45:21,513 --> 00:45:24,582
When they see us coming,
that fire becomes a signal.

721
00:45:24,616 --> 00:45:28,186
Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time.
to throw a party in our honor.

722
00:45:28,221 --> 00:45:30,289
How many wildlings
have joined him?

723
00:45:30,323 --> 00:45:34,492
From what we can tell,
all of them.

724
00:45:39,064 --> 00:45:41,499
<i>Mance has gathered them all</i>
<i>like deer against the wolves.</i>

725
00:45:41,534 --> 00:45:43,535
<i>They're almost ready</i>
<i>to make their move.</i>

726
00:45:43,569 --> 00:45:45,503
Where?

727
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:47,372
Somewhere safe.

728
00:45:47,406 --> 00:45:49,240
Somewhere south.

729
00:45:49,274 --> 00:45:52,209
<i>Can't just march</i>
<i>into their midst.</i>

730
00:45:52,243 --> 00:45:54,030
And we can't wait for them
here with nothing but a pile

731
00:45:54,055 --> 00:45:55,880
of stones to protect us.

732
00:45:55,881 --> 00:45:58,817
You saying we should
fall back to the Wall?

733
00:45:58,851 --> 00:46:02,254
Mance was one of us once.

734
00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:04,690
Now he's one of them.

735
00:46:04,725 --> 00:46:07,460
He's gonna teach them
our way of doing things.

736
00:46:07,495 --> 00:46:09,396
They'll hit us in force.

737
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:11,833
And they won't run away
when we hit back.

738
00:46:11,867 --> 00:46:14,302
<i>They're gonna be more</i>
<i>organized than before,</i>

739
00:46:14,336 --> 00:46:16,237
<i>more disciplined</i>

740
00:46:16,271 --> 00:46:18,306
more like us.

741
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,942
So we need to be
more like them,

742
00:46:20,976 --> 00:46:22,877
do things their way.

743
00:46:22,911 --> 00:46:26,080
Sneak in, kill Mance,

744
00:46:26,114 --> 00:46:27,715
and scatter them
to the winds

745
00:46:27,749 --> 00:46:29,783
before they can march
on the Wall.

746
00:46:29,817 --> 00:46:30,664
And to do that...

747
00:46:30,689 --> 00:46:32,681
We need to get rid
of those lookouts.

748
00:46:32,854 --> 00:46:34,655
It's not a job
for 400 men.

749
00:46:34,689 --> 00:46:38,392
I need to move fast
and silent.

750
00:46:38,426 --> 00:46:42,129
Harker, Stonesnake,
Borba.

751
00:46:43,365 --> 00:46:45,566
Lord Commander, I'd like
to join Lord Qhorin.

752
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,202
I've been called
lots of things,

753
00:46:48,236 --> 00:46:50,124
but that might be
my first Lord Qhorin.

754
00:46:50,605 --> 00:46:53,474
You're a steward,
Snow, not a ranger.

755
00:46:53,509 --> 00:46:55,743
I've fought
and killed a Wight.

756
00:46:55,778 --> 00:46:57,979
How many rangers
can say that?

757
00:46:58,014 --> 00:47:00,048
He's the one?

758
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:03,551
Aye.
You killed a Wight.

759
00:47:03,586 --> 00:47:05,453
You also let an old man

760
00:47:05,488 --> 00:47:08,323
beat you bloody
and take your sword.

761
00:47:08,357 --> 00:47:10,692
<i>Craster?</i>

762
00:47:10,726 --> 00:47:13,728
In the boy's defense,
that's a tough old goat.

763
00:47:16,665 --> 00:47:19,467
I could take up Jon's duties
while he's gone, My Lord.

764
00:47:19,501 --> 00:47:22,136
It would be no trouble.

765
00:47:30,178 --> 00:47:33,581
Well, I hope you make
a better ranger

766
00:47:33,615 --> 00:47:35,950
than you do a steward.

767
00:47:37,653 --> 00:47:39,353
Go on.

768
00:47:46,529 --> 00:47:48,364
<i>So, tell me,</i>

769
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:51,501
how long has your manservant
been in love with you?

770
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:55,238
He's not my manservant
and he's not in love with me.

771
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:57,340
He's my advisor,

772
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,342
my friend.

773
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:00,911
Unlikely.

774
00:48:00,945 --> 00:48:03,681
I can almost always tell
what a man wants.

775
00:48:03,715 --> 00:48:06,050
And what about
what a woman wants?

776
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:08,152
Much more complicated.

777
00:48:08,187 --> 00:48:10,221
You, for example,

778
00:48:10,255 --> 00:48:12,824
what do you want?

779
00:48:12,858 --> 00:48:15,894
To cross the Narrow Sea
and take back the Iron Throne.

780
00:48:15,928 --> 00:48:17,462
Why?

781
00:48:17,497 --> 00:48:19,231
Because I promised
my Khalasar I'd protect them

782
00:48:19,265 --> 00:48:21,667
and find them a safe home.

783
00:48:21,701 --> 00:48:25,305
You want to conquer
the Seven Kingdoms?

784
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:27,007
I want them because
they're mine by right.

785
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:30,110
The Iron Throne is mine
and I will take it.

786
00:48:30,145 --> 00:48:31,945
Ah, a conqueror.

787
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,114
And how did you get
all of this?

788
00:48:34,148 --> 00:48:36,183
- Did someone give it to you?
- No.

789
00:48:36,217 --> 00:48:37,717
I come from nothing.

790
00:48:37,752 --> 00:48:39,919
I hit the docks
like a piece of cargo,

791
00:48:39,954 --> 00:48:42,555
except someone normally
cares what happens to cargo.

792
00:48:42,557 --> 00:48:45,291
So you wanted more than
you had and you took it.

793
00:48:45,325 --> 00:48:49,261
You're a conqueror, too.
you're just less ambitious.

794
00:48:50,997 --> 00:48:53,466
Mmm.

795
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,636
What do you want,
Xaro Zhoan Daxos?

796
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:59,372
At the gates of the city,
you bled for me.

797
00:48:59,406 --> 00:49:02,409
Why?

798
00:49:02,443 --> 00:49:04,778
I will show you why.

799
00:49:08,136 --> 00:49:11,339
The door and the vault
is made of Valyrian stone.

800
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,323
The hardest steel
does not make a mark.

801
00:49:15,357 --> 00:49:18,726
I offered the greatest
locksmiths in Qarth

802
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,095
their weight in gold
if they could break into it.

803
00:49:21,129 --> 00:49:23,697
I made the same offer
to the greatest thieves.

804
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:26,433
They all went home
empty-handed.

805
00:49:26,467 --> 00:49:29,736
The only thing that
can open this door

806
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,904
is this key.

807
00:49:31,939 --> 00:49:33,373
And behind the door?

808
00:49:36,711 --> 00:49:38,879
And it can all be mine?

809
00:49:38,914 --> 00:49:40,581
All?

810
00:49:40,616 --> 00:49:44,085
Let us say half.

811
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:48,357
More than enough to buy
horses, ships, armies--

812
00:49:48,392 --> 00:49:50,493
enough to go home.

813
00:49:50,527 --> 00:49:53,430
All I have to do?

814
00:49:53,464 --> 00:49:54,798
Is marry me.

815
00:49:54,832 --> 00:49:57,934
That was a romantic proposal.

816
00:49:57,968 --> 00:50:00,303
I've already married
once for love,

817
00:50:00,338 --> 00:50:03,073
but the Gods
stole her from me.

818
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:07,311
I come from nothing.

819
00:50:07,345 --> 00:50:10,213
My mother and father
never owned a pair of shoes.

820
00:50:10,247 --> 00:50:13,383
But marry me and I will
give you the Seven Kingdoms

821
00:50:13,417 --> 00:50:17,154
and our children will be
Princes and Princesses.

822
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,424
See?

823
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:24,094
I have more ambition
than you thought.

824
00:50:25,563 --> 00:50:27,672
The time is right,
Daenerys Targaryen,

825
00:50:27,697 --> 00:50:29,697
first of your name.

826
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:32,537
Robert Baratheon
is dead.

827
00:50:39,378 --> 00:50:41,713
<i>If you cross the sea</i>
<i>with an army you bought--</i>

828
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:44,016
The Seven Kingdoms are
at war with one another.

829
00:50:44,051 --> 00:50:46,452
Four false kings
destroying the country.

830
00:50:46,487 --> 00:50:49,789
To win Westeros, you need
support from Westeros.

831
00:50:49,824 --> 00:50:51,624
The usurper is dead.

832
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:53,326
The Starks fight
the Lannisters,

833
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,261
and Baratheons
fight each other.

834
00:50:55,295 --> 00:50:56,829
According to
your new friend

835
00:50:56,863 --> 00:50:58,597
who earned your trust
by cutting his hand?

836
00:50:58,631 --> 00:51:01,500
The time to strike is now. We need
to find ships and an army

837
00:51:01,534 --> 00:51:03,424
or we'll spend the rest
of our lives rotting away

838
00:51:03,449 --> 00:51:04,470
at the edge of the world.

839
00:51:04,471 --> 00:51:06,905
Rich men do not become rich
by giving more than they get.

840
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:09,674
They'll give you ships and soldiers
and they'll own you forever.

841
00:51:09,709 --> 00:51:13,444
Moving carefully is the hard way,
but it's the right way.

842
00:51:13,479 --> 00:51:14,912
And if I'd listened
to that advice

843
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:17,148
outside the gates of Qarth,
we'd all be dead by now.

844
00:51:17,182 --> 00:51:20,251
I know the opportunity before you
seems like the last you'll ever have,

845
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:20,992
but you must--

846
00:51:21,017 --> 00:51:23,017
Do not speak to me
like I'm a child.

847
00:51:26,425 --> 00:51:28,793
- I only want--
- What do you want?

848
00:51:28,827 --> 00:51:31,395
Tell me.

849
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:32,964
To see you
on the Iron Throne.

850
00:51:32,998 --> 00:51:35,733
- Why?
- You have a good claim.

851
00:51:35,767 --> 00:51:38,569
A title.
A birthright.

852
00:51:38,603 --> 00:51:41,805
But you have something
more than that.

853
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:46,076
You may cover it up and deny it,
but you have a gentle heart.

854
00:51:46,111 --> 00:51:48,612
You would not only
be respected and feared,

855
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,148
you would be loved.

856
00:51:51,182 --> 00:51:53,316
Someone who can rule
and should rule.

857
00:51:53,351 --> 00:51:55,440
Centuries come and go
without a person like that

858
00:51:55,465 --> 00:51:57,465
coming into the world.

859
00:51:58,155 --> 00:51:59,722
There are times
when I look at you

860
00:51:59,756 --> 00:52:02,624
and still can't
believe you're real.

861
00:52:14,603 --> 00:52:17,939
So what would you
have me do as my advisor?

862
00:52:23,912 --> 00:52:25,712
<i>Make your own way.</i>

863
00:52:25,747 --> 00:52:28,548
Find your own ship.
You only need one.

864
00:52:28,582 --> 00:52:32,018
The allies we need
are in Westeros, not Qarth.

865
00:52:33,254 --> 00:52:35,722
And how do I get
the ship?

866
00:52:35,756 --> 00:52:38,258
<i>I'll find it for you.</i>

867
00:52:38,292 --> 00:52:40,427
A sound ship
with a good captain.

868
00:52:46,035 --> 00:52:48,736
I look forward
to meeting him.

869
00:52:52,007 --> 00:52:54,141
Khaleesi.

870
00:53:23,674 --> 00:53:25,810
You should stand
sideface.

871
00:53:25,844 --> 00:53:27,979
Sideface?

872
00:53:28,013 --> 00:53:30,115
Sideways.

873
00:53:30,149 --> 00:53:32,550
- Why?
- Smaller target.

874
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,722
Am I fighting someone?

875
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:40,124
You're practicing
for a fight.

876
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:42,760
You should practice right.

877
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:48,032
Guards!

878
00:53:48,066 --> 00:53:51,068
- Help.
- Did you see anything?

879
00:53:52,904 --> 00:53:56,706
Go up there. Go and see where
he fell from.

880
00:54:00,443 --> 00:54:02,411
Go up the back.

881
00:54:02,445 --> 00:54:04,646
<i>That is strange.</i>

882
00:54:11,253 --> 00:54:13,253
Move away.

883
00:54:14,889 --> 00:54:18,359
<i>Stand back.</i>
<i>He's dead.</i>

884
00:54:29,528 --> 00:54:33,528
