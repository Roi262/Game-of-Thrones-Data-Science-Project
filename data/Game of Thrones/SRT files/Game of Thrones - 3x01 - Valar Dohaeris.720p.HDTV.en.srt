Did you send the ravens?

5
00:04:29,546 --> 00:04:33,683
Tarly, look at me.

6
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:38,354
Did you send the ravens?

7
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:43,893
<i>That was your job.</i>

8
00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:46,696
Your only job.

9
00:04:54,204 --> 00:04:57,874
We need to get
back to the Wall.

00:05:00,577 --> 00:05:03,312
<i>We know what's out there,</i>

12

have to warn them

13
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,986
or before winter's done,

14
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,188
everyone you've ever known

15
00:05:12,223 --> 00:05:14,023

First time you've seen

Well, don't stare too long.
They're shy.

21
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:20,845
When they stop being shy,
they get angry.

22
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,014
And when they're angry,

23
00:08:23,048 --> 00:08:26,151
I've seen them pound a man
straight into the ground

24
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:28,186

Sure, you will.

Oh!

37
00:09:11,063 --> 00:09:13,932

Got no fathers to slap 'em

What happened
to their fathers?

41
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:27,412
Some of them were killed
by crows like you.

42
00:09:28,814 --> 00:09:31,883
Don't look so grim,
Jon Snow.

43
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:34,953
If Mance Rayder likes you,

00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:02,080
I smell a crow.

46
00:10:02,147 --> 00:10:04,315
We killed his friends.

47
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,151
Thought you'd want
to question this one.

48
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:09,288
What do we want
with a baby crow?

49
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:12,258
This baby killed
Qhorin Halfhand.

50
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:15,494
<i>He wants to be</i>
<i>one of us.</i>

51
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:24,203
That half-handed cunt
killed friends of mine.

52
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:26,639
Friends twice your size.

53
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:32,211
My father told me big men fall
just as quick as little ones

54
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:35,715
<i>if you put a sword</i>
<i>through their hearts.</i>

55
00:10:35,749 --> 00:10:38,584
Plenty of little men

56
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:41,554
tried to put their swords
through my heart.

57
00:10:41,588 --> 00:10:44,356
And there's plenty
of little skeletons

58
00:10:44,391 --> 00:10:46,058
<i>buried in the woods.</i>

59
00:10:47,828 --> 00:10:51,130
- <i>What's your name, boy?</i>
- Jon Snow.

60
00:10:57,071 --> 00:10:59,339
Your Grace.

61
00:11:01,642 --> 00:11:04,077
Your Grace?

62
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:05,779
Did you hear that?

63
00:11:05,813 --> 00:11:08,882
From now on, you'd better
kneel every time I fart.

64
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:12,318
Stand, boy.

65
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:17,457
We don't kneel for anyone
beyond the Wall.

66
00:11:20,194 --> 00:11:25,332
So, you're
Ned Stark's bastard.

67
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:27,500
Thank you for the gift,
Lord of Bones.

68
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:30,204
You can leave us.

69
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:40,514
The girl likes you.

70
00:11:40,548 --> 00:11:42,716
You like her back, Snow?

71
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:45,119
That why you want
to join us?

72
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:46,921
<i>Don't panic, boy.</i>

73
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,157
This isn't the damned
Night's Watch

74

swear off girls.

75
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:55,096
This chicken eater you thought
was king is Tormund Giantsbane.

76
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,566
Can't believe this pup

77
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,901
<i>killed the Halfhand.</i>

78
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:02,136
He was our enemy

79
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:05,039
and I'm glad he's dead.

80
00:12:14,815 --> 00:12:17,517
He was my brother once.

81
00:12:17,552 --> 00:12:20,220
Back when he had
a whole hand.

82
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:23,757
What were you
doing with him?

83
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:27,094
The Lord Commander sent me
to the Halfhand for seasoning.

84
00:12:27,128 --> 00:12:28,962
Why?

85
00:12:28,996 --> 00:12:30,764
He wants me to lead
one day.

86
00:12:30,798 --> 00:12:34,268
But here you are,
a traitor

87
00:12:34,302 --> 00:12:36,770
kneeling before
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

88
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:40,374
If I'm a traitor,
then you are, too.

89
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:50,985
Why do you want
to join us, Jon Snow?

90
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,926
I want to be free.

91
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,096
No, I don't think so.

92
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,299
I think what you want
most of all

93
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,534
is to be a hero.

94
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:11,472
I'll ask you
one last time--

95
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:14,541
why do you want
to join us?

96
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,582
We stopped at Craster's
Keep on the way north.

97
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:26,486
I saw...

98
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,087
You saw what?

99
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:32,458
I saw Craster take
his own baby boy

100
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:35,227
and leave it
in the woods.

101
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:37,529
I saw what took it.

102
00:13:41,068 --> 00:13:45,171
You're telling me
you saw one of them?

103
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:50,511
And why would that make you
desert your brothers?

104
00:13:50,545 --> 00:13:53,614
Because when I told
the Lord Commander,

105
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:55,649
he already knew.

106
00:13:57,618 --> 00:14:00,254
Thousands of years ago,
the First Men

107
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:03,624
battled the White Walkers
and defeated them.

108
00:14:03,658 --> 00:14:07,628
I want to fight for the side
that fights for the living.

109
00:14:10,698 --> 00:14:12,900
Did I come
to the right place?

110
00:14:17,672 --> 00:14:20,440
We'll need to find you
a new cloak.

111
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:43,764
What if you took off
that bit there?

112
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:49,503
Don't you want to leave
something to the imagination?

113
00:14:49,537 --> 00:14:53,439
Trouble is, I've never
had much imagination.

114
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:58,611
I want you to take it off.

115
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:06,785
Mouth.

116
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:15,559
Ser Bronn.
Ser Bronn.

117
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:19,430
I didn't hear that.

118
00:15:19,464 --> 00:15:21,465
- Apologies, ser.
<i>- Back away.</i>

119
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:24,435
Keep backing away till you're
outside this establishment.

120
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:28,105
- Then back away some more.
- Lord Tyrion sent me.

121
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,108
I will murder you, boy.

122
00:15:31,142 --> 00:15:33,610
He said it was a matter
of life and death.

123
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:53,628
- Pod?
<i>- It's your sister.</i>

124
00:15:54,898 --> 00:15:57,233
<i>The queen.</i>

125
00:16:10,014 --> 00:16:11,282
<i>What are they doing here?</i>

126
00:16:11,316 --> 00:16:14,485
Protecting me, I assume.
Will you let me in?

127
00:16:15,954 --> 00:16:17,354
No, I don't think so.

128
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:19,090
If I wanted to kill you,
do you think

129
00:16:19,124 --> 00:16:21,792
I'd let a wooden door
stop me?

130
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,300
They stay outside.

131
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:31,569
I'm not afraid of you,
little brother.

132
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:49,987
- Why are you here?
- I wanted to see your face.

133
00:16:50,022 --> 00:16:53,592
They said you'd lost your nose, but
it's not as gruesome as all that.

134
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:57,062
The man who cut me
lost more than his nose.

135
00:16:57,096 --> 00:16:59,465
I should hope so.

136
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:02,801
The rebels came for Joffrey's
head, they lost their own.

137
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:04,903
Thanks to Father.

138
00:17:04,938 --> 00:17:07,406
Thanks to Father.

139
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:11,010
Of course, it wasn't a rebel
who tried to kill me.

140
00:17:11,044 --> 00:17:13,579
No? Curious.

141
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:17,416
Bit of a comedown
from chamber of the Hand.

142
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,652
But then I don't suppose
you need much room.

143
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:22,655
Grand Maester Pycelle
made the same joke.

144
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:25,992
You must be proud to be as funny as
a man whose balls brush his knees.

145
00:17:26,026 --> 00:17:27,793
You're meeting
Father today?

146
00:17:27,828 --> 00:17:29,896
How do you know that?

147
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,766
<i>Because I have hundreds</i>
<i>of spies in my employ.</i>

148
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,302
The Master of Whisperers
owes me a favor or two.

149
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:40,940
Father told me.
What do you want from him?

150
00:17:40,975 --> 00:17:42,608
What do I want from him?
He's my father.

151
00:17:42,642 --> 00:17:45,144
Do I need
to want something?

152
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:49,814
I'm sure
he loves me dearly,

153
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:51,549
as any father loves
his child,

154
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:54,252
his baby boy.

155
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:56,354
Yet he hasn't come
to visit once

156
00:17:56,421 --> 00:17:58,022
<i>since arriving</i>
<i>in King's Landing.</i>

157
00:17:58,056 --> 00:18:01,158
<i>I lay here,</i>
<i>my face split in half,</i>

158
00:18:01,226 --> 00:18:03,728
but Father never came.

159
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:11,301
You're going
to make me cry.

160
00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:13,703
Why do you care
what I want from him?

161
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:17,207
Because you've slandered me
to Father before.

162
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:19,475
Slandered?
When?

163
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:21,744
<i>You told him</i>
<i>I had my guards</i>

164
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:23,645
beat that servant girl
at Casterly Rock.

165
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,514
<i>You did have</i>
<i>your guards beat her.</i>

166
00:18:25,548 --> 00:18:26,782
A girl of nine,
I believe.

167
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:28,617
<i>I was nine, too.</i>

168
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:30,685
She lost an eye,
if I remember correctly.

169
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,120
If I remember correctly,

170
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:34,389
she never stole
a necklace again.

171
00:18:36,092 --> 00:18:38,994
It's not slander
if it's true.

172
00:18:39,028 --> 00:18:41,730
And what's this truth
you plan on telling him today?

173
00:18:41,764 --> 00:18:43,498
<i>Why are you so nervous</i>

174
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:45,767
<i>about what I'm going</i>
<i>to say to Father?</i>

175
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:47,869
Because you're a liar.

176
00:18:47,904 --> 00:18:50,973
I expect you'll tell lies
about me, about Joffrey.

177
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,476
Any lies in particular?

178
00:18:55,212 --> 00:18:57,647
You're a clever man,

179
00:18:57,682 --> 00:18:59,950
but you're not half as clever
as you think you are.

180
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:03,020
Still makes me
more clever than you.

181
00:19:06,524 --> 00:19:09,827
Oh, look at these two
shining warriors.

182
00:19:09,861 --> 00:19:13,330
Ser Taryn Mant and...

183
00:19:13,364 --> 00:19:15,099
Ser Whosit of Whocares.

184
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:16,500
Ser Meryn Trant.

185
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:19,070
Ser Bronn
of the Blackwater.

186
00:19:19,104 --> 00:19:21,706
- You're no knight.
- Pod.

187
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,174
Ser Bronn
of the Blackwater

188
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,109
was anointed
by the king himself.

189
00:19:25,177 --> 00:19:27,845
You're an up-jumped
cutthroat,

190
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,481
nothing more.

191
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:31,450
That's exactly who I am.

192
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:33,251
And you're a grub
in fancy armor

193
00:19:33,286 --> 00:19:36,555
<i>who's better at beating little
girls than fighting men.</i>

194
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:39,358
Now, I have an appointment
with Lord Tyrion.

195
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:42,228
You put your hand
on that door,

196
00:19:42,263 --> 00:19:44,864
you lose the hand.

197
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:03,382
As much as I appreciate a walk
in the sunshine, your lordship,

198
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:05,551
I am wondering
why you sent for me.

199
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:07,686
A number of people
in this city want to kill me.

200
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,020
You're here to protect me.

201
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:11,256
I've been doing that
for a while now.

202
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,058
Do you grow bored
protecting me?

203
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:14,559
I grow poor
protecting you.

204
00:20:14,593 --> 00:20:16,494
Poor?
Poor?

205
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:18,596
Under my patronage
you've become a knight,

206
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:20,698
you've served as Commander
of the City Watch.

207
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:23,468
- Briefly.
- I'm sure you filled your pockets.

208
00:20:23,502 --> 00:20:25,570
And now my pockets
are empty.

209
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:27,939
You've given me a taste
for the finer things.

210
00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:29,975
And if you want me
to carry on protecting you,

211
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:31,343
you'll need to pay more.

212
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:33,845
- I thought we were friends.
- We are.

213
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:36,648
But I'm a sellsword.
I sell my sword.

214
00:20:36,682 --> 00:20:38,449
I don't loan it out
to friends as a favor.

215
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:39,917
- How much?
- Double.

216
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:42,119
- Double?
- I'm a knight now.

217
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:43,587
Knights
are worth double.

218
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:45,990
I don't even know how much
I'm paying you now.

219
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:48,092
Which means
you can afford it.

220
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:28,664
Here. Here!

221
00:21:36,975 --> 00:21:39,476
Help me!

222
00:22:02,135 --> 00:22:03,435
Who are you?

223
00:22:05,972 --> 00:22:10,176
I was in the battle
at Blackwater.

224
00:22:11,445 --> 00:22:15,215
I was a captain
and a knight.

225
00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:19,119
Aye, ser,
and serving which king?

226
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:27,462
The one true king
of Westeros--

227
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,166
Stannis Baratheon.

228
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:43,343
I thought you were dead.

229
00:22:43,378 --> 00:22:46,012
Everyone thought
you were dead.

230
00:22:50,317 --> 00:22:51,584
And your son?

231
00:22:57,357 --> 00:22:59,759
He may have swam
ashore as you did.

232
00:22:59,793 --> 00:23:02,829
No, the wildfire took him.
I saw it.

233
00:23:12,339 --> 00:23:15,574
I'm so sorry,
my friend.

234
00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:18,144
I, too, have lost a son.

235
00:23:18,178 --> 00:23:20,546
There is nothing worse
in this world.

236
00:23:22,215 --> 00:23:25,450
But, Davos, you were
a good father.

237
00:23:25,484 --> 00:23:29,020
If I was a good father,
he'd still be here.

238
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,624
Stannis lives?

239
00:23:33,658 --> 00:23:35,860
He licks his wounds
at Dragonstone.

240
00:23:35,894 --> 00:23:37,661
Will you take me there?

241
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:40,097
There is nothing for me
at Dragonstone.

242
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:41,598
This war is not over.

243
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:42,966
Not for you, maybe.

244
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:45,736
But for Salladhor Saan,
the war is over.

245
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,771
We're both sworn
to King Stannis.

246
00:23:47,805 --> 00:23:50,274
I am sworn to no man.

247
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:54,111
I promised you 30 ships and you
promised me riches and glory.

248
00:23:54,145 --> 00:23:55,646
I delivered the ships.

249
00:23:55,681 --> 00:23:57,849
Stannis never gives up.
Never.

250
00:23:57,883 --> 00:24:00,285
- Now he will regroup--
- <i>He's a broken man.</i>

251
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,788
His fleet lies at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.

252
00:24:02,822 --> 00:24:04,457
They say he sees no one--

253
00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:06,726
not his generals,
not even his wife.

254
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,763
Only the Red Woman

255
00:24:09,797 --> 00:24:11,164
whispering in his ear,

256
00:24:11,198 --> 00:24:14,033
telling him what
she sees in the flames

257
00:24:14,068 --> 00:24:15,702
and burning men alive.

258
00:24:15,736 --> 00:24:17,170
What?

259
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:20,707
They built a great fire
when Stannis returned.

260
00:24:20,741 --> 00:24:23,643
All those who spoke
against her she called

261
00:24:23,677 --> 00:24:26,279
servants of darkness.

262
00:24:28,248 --> 00:24:30,783
They say she sang
to them as they burned.

263
00:24:35,589 --> 00:24:37,090
I'm a pirate.

264
00:24:37,124 --> 00:24:39,425
<i>You're a smuggler.</i>

265
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,127
<i>Servants of darkness.</i>

266
00:24:41,161 --> 00:24:44,430
I'm thinking Dragonstone is a
good place for us to avoid.

267
00:24:44,464 --> 00:24:46,731
Take me back there, please.

268
00:24:46,766 --> 00:24:48,666
You cannot turn
Stannis against her.

269
00:24:48,701 --> 00:24:51,335
Maybe not, but I could
carve her heart out.

270
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,970
You could try.

271
00:24:53,005 --> 00:24:55,373
If you fail,
they will burn you.

272
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:58,276
If you succeed,
they'll burn you.

273
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,445
And you've only
just come back to life.

274
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:02,714
Stay alive a little
longer, my friend.

275
00:25:02,748 --> 00:25:05,483
You call me friend. You drank
with me on my wedding day.

276
00:25:05,517 --> 00:25:07,985
And you drank with me
on four of my wedding days,

277
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,921
but I don't ask you
for favors.

278
00:25:09,955 --> 00:25:11,556
I have to stop her.

279
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,726
Please, do this for me.

280
00:25:17,564 --> 00:25:19,932
When you are dead,

281
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:22,401
I will gather your bones
in a little sack

282
00:25:22,435 --> 00:25:25,538
and let your widow
wear them around her neck.

283
00:25:38,486 --> 00:25:41,754
We should set the siege lines
1,000 yards from Harrenhal.

284
00:25:41,788 --> 00:25:44,557
There won't be a siege. The
Mountain can't defend a ruin.

285
00:25:44,591 --> 00:25:46,092
I imagine the Mountain
will defend

286
00:25:46,126 --> 00:25:47,993
whatever Tywin Lannister
tells him to defend.

287
00:25:48,028 --> 00:25:50,196
The Lannisters have been
running from us since Oxcross.

288
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,932
I'd love a fight.
The men would love a fight.

289
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:55,769
I don't think
we're going to get one.

290
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,090
200 Northmen
slaughtered like sheep.

291
00:26:48,158 --> 00:26:51,161
The debt will be
repaid, my friend.

292
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:53,997
For them
and for your sons.

293
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:56,199
Will it?

294
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:58,567
They rot in the ground

295
00:26:58,601 --> 00:27:00,803
<i>while their killer</i>
<i>runs free.</i>

296
00:27:00,837 --> 00:27:03,772
The Kingslayer won't
remain free for long.

297
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:06,642
My best hunters
are after him.

298
00:27:25,328 --> 00:27:29,298
<i>- A Mallister?</i>
- Ser Jeremy.

299
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:31,867
My father's bannerman.

300
00:27:52,156 --> 00:27:55,091
Find her a chamber
that will serve as a cell.

301
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:08,805
<i>She's your mother.</i>

302
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:11,474
She freed
Jaime Lannister.

303
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:13,877
The Lannisters robbed
them of their sons

304
00:28:13,911 --> 00:28:15,679
and she robbed them
of their justice.

305
00:28:17,748 --> 00:28:18,982
<i>Water.</i>

306
00:28:21,185 --> 00:28:22,819
Water.

307
00:28:22,854 --> 00:28:25,088
This needs to be
cleaned and closed.

308
00:28:29,661 --> 00:28:31,830
What's your name, friend?

309
00:28:31,864 --> 00:28:33,731
Qyburn.

310
00:28:33,766 --> 00:28:35,133
You're lucky to be alive.

311
00:28:38,337 --> 00:28:40,872
Lucky?

312
00:29:06,769 --> 00:29:08,837
The badge
looks good on you.

313
00:29:10,673 --> 00:29:13,308
Almost as good
as it looked on me.

314
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:18,680
Are you enjoying
your new position?

315
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:21,850
Am I enjoying it?

316
00:29:21,884 --> 00:29:24,286
I was very happy
as Hand of the King.

317
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,354
Yes.

318
00:29:26,388 --> 00:29:28,356
I heard how happy you were.

319
00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:32,860
You brought a whore
into my bed.

320
00:29:32,894 --> 00:29:35,496
It wasn't your bed
at the time.

321
00:29:37,933 --> 00:29:40,868
I sent you here
to advise the king.

322
00:29:40,902 --> 00:29:44,938
I gave you real power
and authority.

323
00:29:44,972 --> 00:29:47,307
You chose
to spend your days

324
00:29:47,341 --> 00:29:49,509
as you always have,

325
00:29:49,543 --> 00:29:51,978
bedding harlots

326
00:29:52,012 --> 00:29:54,380
and drinking with thieves.

327
00:29:56,383 --> 00:29:59,185
Occasionally I drank
with the harlots.

328
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:01,587
What do you want, Tyrion?

329
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:04,624
Why does everyone assume
I want something?

330
00:30:04,658 --> 00:30:07,560
Can't I simply visit
with my beloved father?

331
00:30:07,595 --> 00:30:11,197
My beloved father who

332
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:13,933
somehow forgot to visit
his wounded son

333
00:30:13,967 --> 00:30:15,801
after he fell
on the battlefield.

334
00:30:15,836 --> 00:30:19,405
Maester Pycelle assured me
your wounds were not fatal.

335
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:22,441
I organized
the defense of this city

336
00:30:22,475 --> 00:30:25,644
while you held court
in the ruins of Harrenhal.

337
00:30:25,678 --> 00:30:28,412
I led the foray when the
enemies were at the gate

338
00:30:28,447 --> 00:30:30,715
while your grandson,
the king,

339
00:30:30,749 --> 00:30:33,384
quivered in fear
behind the walls.

340
00:30:33,418 --> 00:30:37,021
I bled in the mud
for our family.

341
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,524
And as my reward,

342
00:30:39,558 --> 00:30:42,894
I was trundled off
to some dark little cell.

343
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:44,929
But what do I want?

344
00:30:46,265 --> 00:30:48,399
A little bloody gratitude
would be a start.

345
00:30:48,434 --> 00:30:51,669
Jugglers and singers
require applause.

346
00:30:51,704 --> 00:30:54,139
You are a Lannister.

347
00:30:54,173 --> 00:30:57,208
<i>Do you think I demanded</i>
<i>a garland of roses</i>

348
00:30:57,243 --> 00:30:59,945
<i>every time I suffered</i>
<i>a wound on a battlefield?</i>

349
00:30:59,979 --> 00:31:01,946
Hmm?

350
00:31:02,014 --> 00:31:05,783
Now, I have seven kingdoms
to look after

351
00:31:05,851 --> 00:31:08,185
and three of them
are in open rebellion.

352
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,990
So tell me what you want.

353
00:31:16,896 --> 00:31:19,698
I want what is mine
by right.

354
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:24,737
Jaime is your eldest son,
heir to your lands and titles.

355
00:31:24,805 --> 00:31:29,076
But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden
from marriage or inheritance.

356
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,145
The day Jaime put on
the white cloak,

357
00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:34,948
he gave up his claim
to Casterly Rock.

358
00:31:34,983 --> 00:31:38,051
I am your son
and lawful heir.

359
00:31:41,022 --> 00:31:42,656
You want Casterly Rock?

360
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:44,658
It is mine by right.

361
00:31:49,231 --> 00:31:51,332
We'll find you
accommodations

362
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,268
more suited
to your name

363
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:55,670
<i>and as a reward</i>
<i>for your accomplishments</i>

364
00:31:55,704 --> 00:31:58,573
during the battle
of Blackwater Bay.

365
00:32:00,276 --> 00:32:02,277
And when the time is right,
you will be given a position

366
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:03,978
<i>fit for your talents</i>

367
00:32:04,013 --> 00:32:06,548
so that you can
serve your family

368
00:32:06,582 --> 00:32:08,683
and protect our legacy.

369
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,352
<i>And if you serve</i>
<i>faithfully,</i>

370
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,921
<i>you will be rewarded</i>
<i>with a suitable wife.</i>

371
00:32:12,955 --> 00:32:16,791
And I would let myself
be consumed by maggots

372
00:32:16,825 --> 00:32:18,093
<i>before mocking</i>
<i>the family name</i>

373
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:21,063
<i>and making you</i>
<i>heir to Casterly Rock.</i>

374
00:32:22,665 --> 00:32:25,466
- Why?
- Why?

375
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,635
You ask that?

376
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:31,071
You, who killed your mother
to come into the world?

377
00:32:31,106 --> 00:32:35,242
You are an ill-made,
spiteful little creature

378
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:39,280
full of envy, lust,
and low cunning.

379
00:32:39,314 --> 00:32:41,882
<i>Men's laws give you</i>
<i>the right to bear my name</i>

380
00:32:41,917 --> 00:32:46,520
and display my colors since I
cannot prove that you are not mine.

381
00:32:48,223 --> 00:32:50,591
<i>And to teach me humility,</i>
<i>the gods have condemned me</i>

382
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:54,027
to watch you waddle about
wearing that proud lion

383
00:32:54,062 --> 00:32:57,965
that was my father's sigil
and his father's before him.

384
00:32:57,999 --> 00:32:59,700
But neither gods nor men

385
00:32:59,734 --> 00:33:02,636
will ever compel me
to let you turn Casterly Rock

386
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:05,772
<i>into your whorehouse.</i>

387
00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:08,675
Go, now.

388
00:33:11,846 --> 00:33:15,582
Speak no more of your rights
to Casterly Rock.

389
00:33:17,584 --> 00:33:19,786
Go.

390
00:33:28,762 --> 00:33:30,896
Oh, one more thing.

391
00:33:33,233 --> 00:33:36,435
The next whore I catch
in your bed I'll hang.

392
00:33:44,378 --> 00:33:47,181
<i>Dorne.</i>
<i>It's going to Dorne.</i>

393
00:33:47,215 --> 00:33:50,117
<i>- Why Dorne?</i>
- It's carrying silk

394
00:33:50,152 --> 00:33:53,621
and it's supposed to bring
back wine in exchange.

395
00:33:57,659 --> 00:33:59,993
But it's not
coming back.

396
00:34:00,028 --> 00:34:02,629
The captain's tired
of risking his life

397
00:34:02,664 --> 00:34:04,832
so King's Landing
lords and ladies

398
00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:07,935
can get drunk on better
wine than they deserve.

399
00:34:09,304 --> 00:34:11,506
He's going
to stay in Dorne.

400
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,876
Wait out the winter where
it's beautiful and warm.

401
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:18,680
I met some people in Dorne who
weren't so beautiful and warm.

402
00:34:18,715 --> 00:34:20,683
Don't ruin the game.

403
00:34:20,717 --> 00:34:23,453
I told you,
I don't want to play.

404
00:34:24,555 --> 00:34:26,589
What about that one there?

405
00:34:26,624 --> 00:34:28,091
That one?

406
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:30,127
It's going to Volantis.

407
00:34:30,161 --> 00:34:31,595
Why?

408
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:33,330
Because when I got
on a ship in Volantis,

409
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:35,899
it looked like that one.

410
00:34:35,934 --> 00:34:37,735
That's not how
the game works.

411
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:41,339
You're not supposed to just
blurt out the right answer.

412
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:42,973
You've got
to invent a story

413
00:34:43,008 --> 00:34:46,443
about where the ship
is going and why.

414
00:34:46,478 --> 00:34:49,347
Why should I make up a story
when I know the truth?

415
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:51,415
Because the truth

416
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,985
is always either
terrible or boring.

417
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:56,788
Lovely day for it.

418
00:34:56,822 --> 00:34:58,724
Watching the ships.

419
00:34:58,758 --> 00:35:01,727
Lord Baelish.

420
00:35:01,762 --> 00:35:04,797
Might I speak
with Lady Sansa

421
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,466
alone for a moment?

422
00:35:17,945 --> 00:35:20,813
I saw your mother
not long ago.

423
00:35:22,215 --> 00:35:24,516
She's very eager
to see you.

424
00:35:26,286 --> 00:35:29,587
And your sister.

425
00:35:29,622 --> 00:35:32,224
Arya's alive?

426
00:35:35,528 --> 00:35:37,395
You said
you'd take me home.

427
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:40,798
You said King's Landing
was your home.

428
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,367
You are the property
of the crown.

429
00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:44,768
Stealing you
would be treason.

430
00:35:44,803 --> 00:35:47,037
If you were to tell
just one person--

431
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,073
- I won't tell anyone.
- How do I know?

432
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:51,041
Because I'm a terrible liar.

433
00:35:51,075 --> 00:35:53,710
You said so yourself.

434
00:35:53,744 --> 00:35:56,913
Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do.
Tell me when.

435
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,684
I'm waiting for word
on an assignment

436
00:36:01,718 --> 00:36:04,920
that will take me far away
from the capital.

437
00:36:04,988 --> 00:36:06,655
When I set sail,

438
00:36:06,689 --> 00:36:09,224
I might be able
to take you with me.

439
00:36:09,258 --> 00:36:12,260
But you'll need to be ready to
leave on a moment's notice.

440
00:36:14,697 --> 00:36:16,965
You're her handmaiden?

441
00:36:19,001 --> 00:36:21,837
Yes.
And you're his...?

442
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:25,341
I help manage
his affairs.

443
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:28,778
- He's an important person.
- So is she.

444
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:31,346
I grew up in the shadow
of her father's castle.

445
00:36:31,381 --> 00:36:33,382
The day she was born,
they rang the bells

446
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:35,818
from sunrise till sunset.

447
00:36:38,188 --> 00:36:40,823
We've both done
rather well, you and I.

448
00:36:43,394 --> 00:36:45,161
Yes.

449
00:36:45,195 --> 00:36:48,431
Given where we started.

450
00:36:48,465 --> 00:36:50,700
And where is that?

451
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:54,236
It's not easy
for girls like us

452
00:36:54,271 --> 00:36:56,439
to dig our way out.

453
00:37:01,211 --> 00:37:03,812
<i>Watch out for her.</i>

454
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:06,681
I always do.

455
00:37:06,716 --> 00:37:09,417
Watch out for her
with him.

456
00:38:01,706 --> 00:38:03,808
They're growing fast.

457
00:38:07,012 --> 00:38:08,545
Not fast enough.

458
00:38:09,714 --> 00:38:11,983
I can't wait that long.

459
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,855
I need an army.

460
00:38:18,224 --> 00:38:20,658
We'll be in Astapor
by nightfall.

461
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:24,729
Some say the Unsullied are the
greatest soldiers in the world.

462
00:38:24,764 --> 00:38:27,566
The greatest slave-soldiers
in the world.

463
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,902
The distinction means
a good deal to some people.

464
00:38:29,936 --> 00:38:31,770
Do those people
have any better ideas

465
00:38:31,804 --> 00:38:35,073
about how to put you
on the Iron Throne?

466
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:38,610
It's too beautiful
a day to argue.

467
00:38:42,214 --> 00:38:43,948
You're right.

468
00:38:46,651 --> 00:38:49,153
Another lovely day
on the high seas.

469
00:38:49,187 --> 00:38:50,954
<i>Don't mock them.</i>

470
00:38:50,989 --> 00:38:53,357
They're the first Dothraki
who have ever been on a ship.

471
00:38:53,424 --> 00:38:55,759
They followed me
across the poison water.

472
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,094
If they'll do it,
others will.

473
00:38:57,128 --> 00:38:58,661
And with a true
khalasar--

474
00:38:58,696 --> 00:39:02,799
The Dothraki follow strength
above all, khaleesi.

475
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:06,602
You'll have a true khalasar
when you prove yourself strong.

476
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:08,838
And not before.

477
00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:37,666
Your Grace.

478
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:51,248
I heard you were dead.

479
00:39:51,282 --> 00:39:53,150
Not yet.

480
00:39:55,286 --> 00:39:58,155
I had hoped to speak
to you alone, Your Grace.

481
00:39:59,224 --> 00:40:01,225
We are alone.

482
00:40:11,237 --> 00:40:14,406
Your Grace, you are
the rightful king.

483
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,309
<i>Not only by blood.</i>

484
00:40:17,343 --> 00:40:20,312
You're an honorable man,
a just man.

485
00:40:20,346 --> 00:40:22,648
And there is still
a war to fight.

486
00:40:22,682 --> 00:40:25,383
I am fighting.

487
00:40:25,418 --> 00:40:28,053
By burning
prisoners alive?

488
00:40:30,357 --> 00:40:32,124
How would you punish
the infidels, Ser Davos?

489
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:34,594
I do not judge people
for the gods they worship.

490
00:40:34,628 --> 00:40:36,729
If I did, I'd have
thrown you in the sea

491
00:40:36,763 --> 00:40:39,498
before you ever set foot
on Dragonstone.

492
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,234
- I'm not your enemy.
- You are my enemy.

493
00:40:46,173 --> 00:40:48,574
Was it me you fought
on Blackwater Bay?

494
00:40:49,877 --> 00:40:52,378
<i>Did I set</i>
<i>your ships ablaze?</i>

495
00:40:55,883 --> 00:41:00,020
I wasn't there when the wildfire
killed our men by the thousands.

496
00:41:02,023 --> 00:41:04,692
I could have
saved those men.

497
00:41:04,726 --> 00:41:06,360
You would have
taken the city,

498
00:41:06,428 --> 00:41:08,269
Stannis would now sit
upon his rightful throne,

499
00:41:08,297 --> 00:41:09,965
and you would
stand beside him.

500
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:12,534
<i>But I wasn't there</i>

501
00:41:12,568 --> 00:41:16,238
because you convinced
your king to leave me behind.

502
00:41:24,414 --> 00:41:27,449
Do you hear them screaming?

503
00:41:27,483 --> 00:41:30,786
All those burning men
in the water

504
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,488
crying for their mothers,

505
00:41:33,523 --> 00:41:36,391
for their gods for help?

506
00:41:36,425 --> 00:41:39,160
Until the moment
the Blackwater swallowed them.

507
00:41:46,034 --> 00:41:48,435
Don't despair, Ser Davos.

508
00:41:48,469 --> 00:41:50,837
What I told
your son is true.

509
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:53,239
Death by fire

510
00:41:53,274 --> 00:41:54,975
is the purest death.

511
00:41:56,878 --> 00:41:59,112
This woman is evil!

512
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,814
She's the mother of demons.

513
00:42:00,848 --> 00:42:03,683
Take him to the dungeon
and lock him in a cell.

514
00:42:03,718 --> 00:42:05,218
- Your Grace!
- Come on.

515
00:42:05,253 --> 00:42:06,520
You've chosen
the darkness, Ser Davos.

516
00:42:06,554 --> 00:42:09,422
- She will destroy us all!
- I will pray for you.

517
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:11,458
<i>Your Grace!</i>

518
00:42:38,919 --> 00:42:41,521
<i>Halt. Down.</i>

519
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:45,592
<i>Halt. Down.</i>

520
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,067
Why have we stopped?

521
00:42:53,101 --> 00:42:54,635
It's Lady Margaery,
Your Grace.

522
00:42:59,941 --> 00:43:01,809
<i>What is she doing?</i>
<i>Who gave her permission?</i>

523
00:43:01,843 --> 00:43:05,746
My lady. We should have
guards, my lady.

524
00:43:05,781 --> 00:43:08,149
Why?

525
00:43:11,287 --> 00:43:13,054
Pardon me.

526
00:43:20,063 --> 00:43:23,499
Stop, my lady.
You'll ruin your dress.

527
00:43:23,533 --> 00:43:25,334
I have others.

528
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,542
Would you like to speak
with her, Your Grace?

529
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:38,814
No.

530
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:40,582
He was a soldier.

531
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:42,517
He went to fight
on the walls

532
00:43:42,552 --> 00:43:45,120
when the ships came
into Blackwater Bay.

533
00:43:45,154 --> 00:43:47,222
He never came back.

534
00:43:47,256 --> 00:43:49,057
And your mother?

535
00:43:49,091 --> 00:43:51,492
She died
when she had me.

536
00:43:54,063 --> 00:43:56,331
Bad men wanted
to come into this city

537
00:43:56,365 --> 00:44:00,034
and do terrible things,
but your father stopped them.

538
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:08,043
Whenever you look
at this knight,

539
00:44:08,077 --> 00:44:10,912
I want you to remember
your father.

540
00:44:13,582 --> 00:44:15,382
He wasn't a knight.

541
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:17,351
He was just a soldier.

542
00:44:17,385 --> 00:44:19,753
And what do knights
swear to do?

543
00:44:19,787 --> 00:44:23,122
Protect the weak
and uphold the good.

544
00:44:23,157 --> 00:44:26,892
Your father did that.
Be proud of him.

545
00:44:29,629 --> 00:44:32,798
Was your father
a soldier, too?

546
00:44:33,866 --> 00:44:36,735
You should be proud, too.

547
00:44:38,605 --> 00:44:40,906
Under King Joffrey's
leadership,

548
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,675
your fathers
saved the city.

549
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,011
They saved us all.

550
00:44:46,045 --> 00:44:49,415
From now on, we're going
to take care of you.

551
00:44:51,818 --> 00:44:53,852
All of you.

552
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:02,660
Come to me for whatever
you need to feed them,

553
00:45:02,695 --> 00:45:04,762
clothe them,
or house them.

554
00:45:06,565 --> 00:45:08,665
Directly to me.

555
00:45:23,414 --> 00:45:25,582
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

556
00:45:25,617 --> 00:45:27,217
Please, sit.
Sit.

557
00:45:27,252 --> 00:45:29,720
I do apologize,
my lady.

558
00:45:29,754 --> 00:45:32,090
Small council meetings.

559
00:45:32,124 --> 00:45:34,225
At what point
does it become treason

560
00:45:34,259 --> 00:45:36,127
to waste the king's time?

561
00:45:40,834 --> 00:45:42,568
That's a lovely gown,
my lady.

562
00:45:42,603 --> 00:45:44,604
Yes, it suits you
perfectly.

563
00:45:44,638 --> 00:45:47,040
I imagine you might
be rather cold.

564
00:45:47,074 --> 00:45:50,444
The climate is a bit more forgiving
back in Highgarden, Your Grace.

565
00:45:50,478 --> 00:45:54,180
Shall I have them bring
you a shawl, my lady?

566
00:45:54,215 --> 00:45:56,683
I am touched by your
concern, Your Grace.

567
00:45:56,718 --> 00:45:59,920
Luckily for us Tyrells,
our blood runs quite warm.

568
00:45:59,954 --> 00:46:01,922
- <i>Doesn't it, Loras?</i>
- Yes.

569
00:46:01,956 --> 00:46:05,059
Loras, isn't the queen's
gown magnificent?

570
00:46:05,093 --> 00:46:07,961
The fabric, the embroidery,
the metalwork.

571
00:46:07,996 --> 00:46:09,630
I've never seen
anything like it.

572
00:46:09,664 --> 00:46:11,565
You might find a bit
of armor quite useful

573
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,201
once you become queen.
Perhaps before.

574
00:46:14,235 --> 00:46:18,038
<i>Joffrey tells me you stopped
your carriage at Flea Bottom</i>

575
00:46:18,072 --> 00:46:19,840
on your way back from
the sept this morning.

576
00:46:19,874 --> 00:46:24,244
Yes. I paid a visit
to an orphanage

577
00:46:24,278 --> 00:46:25,812
the High Septon
told me about.

578
00:46:25,846 --> 00:46:28,527
Margaery does a great deal of work
with the poor back in Highgarden.

579
00:46:28,549 --> 00:46:32,853
The lowest among us are no different from
the highest if you give them a chance

580
00:46:32,887 --> 00:46:35,156
and approach them
with an open heart.

581
00:46:35,223 --> 00:46:37,258
<i>An open heart is what</i>
<i>you'll get in Flea Bottom</i>

582
00:46:37,292 --> 00:46:38,859
<i>if you're not careful,</i>
<i>my dear.</i>

583
00:46:38,893 --> 00:46:42,729
Not long ago, we were
attacked by a mob there.

584
00:46:42,797 --> 00:46:45,699
We had a full complement
of guards that didn't stop them.

585
00:46:45,733 --> 00:46:48,702
The king barely escaped
with his life.

586
00:46:48,736 --> 00:46:52,206
My mother's always had
a penchant for drama.

587
00:46:52,273 --> 00:46:54,809
Facts become less and less
important to her

588
00:46:54,843 --> 00:46:56,844
<i>as she grows older.</i>

589
00:46:56,912 --> 00:46:59,814
Our lives were never
truly in danger.

590
00:47:01,049 --> 00:47:02,783
You're right, of course.

591
00:47:02,818 --> 00:47:06,053
But you are
your father's son.

592
00:47:06,088 --> 00:47:08,255
We can't all have
a king's bravery.

593
00:47:16,432 --> 00:47:18,633
Hunger turns men
into beasts.

594
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:22,504
I'm glad House Tyrell has been
able to help in this regard.

595
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:26,375
They tell me 100 wagons arrive
daily now from the Reach.

596
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:29,912
<i>Wheat, barley, apples.</i>
<i>We've had a blessed harvest.</i>

597
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:32,615
And, of course, it's our
duty to assist the capital

598
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:34,684
in time of need.

599
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:36,419
Well, as Ser Loras said,

600
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:39,589
Lady Margaery has done
this sort of...

601
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:41,557
charitable work before.

602
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,727
I'm sure she knows
what she's doing.

603
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:48,131
I'm sure she does.

604
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:19,363
The Unsullied have stood here
for a day and a night

605
00:48:19,398 --> 00:48:21,533
with no food or water.

606
00:48:27,841 --> 00:48:29,775
They will stand
until they drop.

607
00:48:32,112 --> 00:48:34,012
Such is their
obedience.

608
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:38,117
They may suit my needs.

609
00:48:38,151 --> 00:48:40,119
Tell me of their training.

610
00:49:00,408 --> 00:49:02,976
They begin their
training at five.

611
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,978
Every day they drill
from dawn to dusk

612
00:49:05,013 --> 00:49:07,181
until they have mastered
the shortsword,

613
00:49:07,215 --> 00:49:09,616
the shield,
and the three spears.

614
00:49:09,651 --> 00:49:13,254
Only one boy in four survives
this rigorous training.

615
00:49:15,457 --> 00:49:19,326
<i>Their discipline</i>
<i>and loyalty are absolute.</i>

616
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,128
<i>They fear nothing.</i>

617
00:49:21,162 --> 00:49:24,197
Even the bravest men
fear death.

618
00:49:45,353 --> 00:49:48,322
<i>My master says</i>
<i>the Unsullied are not men.</i>

619
00:49:48,356 --> 00:49:50,724
Death means nothing
to them.

620
00:49:59,233 --> 00:50:02,201
He begs you attend to this
carefully, Your Grace.

621
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:18,851
Tell the good master
there is no need.

622
00:50:26,626 --> 00:50:29,594
<i>My master points out</i>
<i>that men don't need nipples.</i>

623
00:50:45,412 --> 00:50:47,580
To win his shield,

624
00:50:47,614 --> 00:50:51,350
an Unsullied must go to the
slave marts with a silver mark,

625
00:50:51,384 --> 00:50:56,355
find a newborn and kill it
before its mother's eyes.

626
00:50:58,692 --> 00:51:01,126
<i>This way, my master says,</i>
<i>we make certain</i>

627
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:03,262
<i>there is no weakness</i>
<i>left in them.</i>

628
00:51:04,598 --> 00:51:07,400
You take a babe
from its mother's arms,

629
00:51:07,434 --> 00:51:11,737
kill it as she watches, and pay
for her pain with a silver coin?

630
00:51:25,652 --> 00:51:28,253
My master would like you to
know that the silver is paid

631
00:51:28,288 --> 00:51:30,856
to the baby's owner,
not the mother.

632
00:51:36,997 --> 00:51:38,964
How many do you
have to sell?

633
00:51:44,305 --> 00:51:46,273
8,000.

634
00:51:50,912 --> 00:51:53,548
Master Kraznys asks
that you please hurry.

635
00:51:53,582 --> 00:51:56,417
Many other buyers
are interested.

636
00:52:06,561 --> 00:52:09,730
8,000 dead babies.

637
00:52:09,765 --> 00:52:12,333
The Unsullied
are a means to an end.

638
00:52:12,367 --> 00:52:14,702
Once I own them,
these men--

639
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:17,271
They're not men.
Not anymore.

640
00:52:17,305 --> 00:52:20,674
Once I own an army of
slaves, what will I be?

641
00:52:20,708 --> 00:52:22,776
Do you think these slaves
will have better lives

642
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:26,246
serving Kraznys and men
like him or serving you?

643
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,460
You'll be fair to them.

644
00:52:41,495 --> 00:52:44,263
You won't mutilate them
to make a point.

645
00:52:48,836 --> 00:52:51,037
You won't order them
to murder babies.

646
00:52:51,072 --> 00:52:53,907
You'll see they're properly
fed and sheltered.

647
00:52:53,941 --> 00:52:56,776
A great injustice
has been done to them.

648
00:52:57,946 --> 00:53:00,480
Closing your eyes
will not undo it.

649
00:53:57,269 --> 00:53:59,204
The warlocks.

650
00:54:02,676 --> 00:54:05,545
I owe you my life, ser.

651
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,214
The honor is mine,

652
00:54:07,248 --> 00:54:09,449
my queen.

653
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,088
You know this man?

654
00:54:15,122 --> 00:54:16,923
I know him

655
00:54:16,957 --> 00:54:21,428
as one of the greatest fighters
the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen

656
00:54:21,462 --> 00:54:23,030
and as the Lord Commander

657
00:54:23,064 --> 00:54:25,832
of Robert Baratheon's
Kingsguard.

658
00:54:27,368 --> 00:54:29,303
King Robert is dead.

659
00:54:29,337 --> 00:54:32,206
I have been searching
for you, Daenerys Stormborn,

660
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,775
to ask your forgiveness.

661
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:37,845
I was sworn to protect
your family.

662
00:54:39,581 --> 00:54:41,515
I failed them.

663
00:54:46,922 --> 00:54:49,190
I am Barristan Selmy,

664
00:54:49,224 --> 00:54:51,526
Kingsguard to your father.

665
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,961
<i>Allow me to join</i>
<i>your Queensguard</i>

666
00:54:53,996 --> 00:54:57,065
and I will not
fail you again.

9999

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
