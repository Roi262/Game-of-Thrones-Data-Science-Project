1
00:00:02,697 --> 00:00:05,088
_

2
00:00:05,497 --> 00:00:08,704
Your father has proved
to be an awful traitor.

3
00:00:08,705 --> 00:00:11,704
The girl is innocent. She
should be given a chance

4
00:00:11,705 --> 00:00:13,105
to prove her loyalty.

5
00:00:13,331 --> 00:00:14,954
You must write to Lady Catelyn.

6
00:00:14,955 --> 00:00:17,829
If you would help your
father, urge your brother

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,230
to keep the king's peace.

8
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:20,954
Tell him to come to King's Landing,

9
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:22,747
and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

10
00:00:25,122 --> 00:00:27,580
You're sure this is the
only copy in Winterfell?

11
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:43,704
Daenerys is not her father.

12
00:00:43,705 --> 00:00:46,621
And she never will be.
With the right counsel.

13
00:00:46,622 --> 00:00:48,414
I am her hand, not her head.

14
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,496
I can't make her decisions for her.

15
00:00:50,497 --> 00:00:53,039
You need to find a way
to make her listen.

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,496
It's called Longclaw. It
was my father's sword.

17
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:00,662
It was meant for my son, Jorah.

18
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:02,371
He brought dishonor to our house,

19
00:01:02,372 --> 00:01:05,871
but he had the grace to leave
the sword before he fled

20
00:01:05,872 --> 00:01:07,331
from Westeros.

21
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:10,996
Clegane, look into the flames.
What do you see?

22
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,914
There's a mountain. Looks
like an arrowhead.

23
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:18,747
The dead are marching past.
Thousands of 'em.

24
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:20,496
Cersei thinks the army of the dead

25
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,871
is nothing but a story.

26
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:24,330
What if we prove her wrong,
bring one of these things

27
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:26,538
down to King's Landing
and show her the truth?

28
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,247
We're all on the same side.

29
00:01:32,622 --> 00:01:34,022
We're all breathin'.

- You all right?
- Mm.

32
00:04:09,955 --> 00:04:12,163
Ever been north before?

33
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:13,829
Never seen snow before.

34
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,704
Beautiful, eh?

35
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:17,246
I can breathe again.

36
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:19,413
Down south, the air
smells like pig shit.

37
00:04:19,414 --> 00:04:21,038
You've never been down south.

38
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:22,954
- I've been to Winterfell.
- That's the North.

39
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:26,496
How do you live up here?

40
00:04:26,497 --> 00:04:28,371
How do you keep your
balls from freezing off?

41
00:04:28,372 --> 00:04:30,871
You got to keep moving.
That's the secret.

42
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:34,913
Walking's good, fighting's
better, fucking's best.

43
00:04:34,914 --> 00:04:38,371
There's not a living woman
within a hundred miles of here.

44
00:04:38,372 --> 00:04:40,747
We have to make do with what we've got.

45
00:04:46,372 --> 00:04:48,954
This one is maybe not so smart.

46
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,871
Davos says he's a strong fighter.

47
00:04:50,872 --> 00:04:54,371
Good. That's more important
than being smart.

48
00:04:54,372 --> 00:04:57,580
Smart people don't come up
here looking for the dead.

49
00:04:59,122 --> 00:05:02,413
So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh?

50
00:05:02,414 --> 00:05:03,787
And?

51
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:07,163
She'll only fight beside
us if I bend the knee.

52
00:05:07,164 --> 00:05:09,579
You spent too much time
with the Free Folk.

53
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,289
Now you don't like kneeling.

54
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,579
Mance Rayder was a brave man.

55
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,413
A proud man.

56
00:05:18,414 --> 00:05:22,247
The King-beyond-the-Wall
never bent the knee.

57
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,247
How many of his people
died for his pride?

58
00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:42,579
You still mad at us, boy?

59
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,621
You sold me to a witch.

60
00:05:44,622 --> 00:05:46,038
A priestess.

61
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:48,954
I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction.

62
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:52,121
We're fighting a great war.
Wars cost money.

63
00:05:52,122 --> 00:05:53,996
I wanted to be one of you.

64
00:05:53,997 --> 00:05:57,038
I wanted to join the
Brotherhood, but you sold me off

65
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,996
like a slave.

66
00:05:58,997 --> 00:06:00,996
Do you know what she did to me?

67
00:06:00,997 --> 00:06:02,579
She strapped me down on a bed,

68
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,413
- she stripped me naked...
- Sounds all right so far.

69
00:06:05,414 --> 00:06:08,163
- and put leeches on me.
- Was she naked, too?

70
00:06:08,164 --> 00:06:09,621
She needed your blood.

71
00:06:09,622 --> 00:06:11,288
Yes, thank you. I know that.

72
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:14,246
- Could have been worse.
- She wanted to kill me!

73
00:06:14,247 --> 00:06:16,282
They would have killed
me if wasn't for Davos.

74
00:06:16,283 --> 00:06:18,247
But they didn't, did they?

75
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:20,163
So, what you whinging about?

76
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:21,829
I'm not whinging.

77
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,787
Your lips are moving and you're
complaining about something.

78
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:26,829
That's whinging.

79
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,621
This one's been killed six times.

80
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,331
You don't hear him bitching about it.

81
00:06:40,538 --> 00:06:41,955
Good lad.

82
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:50,163
The first time I went north of
the Wall was with your father.

83
00:06:50,164 --> 00:06:51,787
He was a good man.

84
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:54,913
He deserved a better son.

85
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,954
Were you with him at the end?

86
00:06:56,955 --> 00:07:00,038
I was a prisoner of the wildlings.

87
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,038
But we avenged him.

88
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,537
I want you to know that.

89
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:06,537
Every mutineer found justice.

90
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:09,371
Can't think of a worse
way for him to go.

91
00:07:09,372 --> 00:07:10,871
The Night's Watch was his life.

92
00:07:10,872 --> 00:07:13,704
He would have died to protect
every one of those men.

93
00:07:13,705 --> 00:07:15,163
And they butchered him.

94
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:18,371
I hate that he died that way.

95
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:21,038
My father was the most
honorable man I ever met.

96
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,829
He was good all the way through.

97
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,079
And he died on the executioner's block.

98
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,246
Your father wanted to
execute me, you know?

99
00:07:31,247 --> 00:07:32,787
I heard.

100
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:35,079
He was in the right, of course.

101
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,579
Didn't make me hate him any less.

102
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,580
- I'm glad he didn't catch you.
- Me, too.

103
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,829
Your father gave me this sword.

104
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,372
Changed the pommel from
a bear to a wolf...

105
00:07:58,039 --> 00:07:59,622
but it's still Longclaw.

106
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:07,913
Lord Commander Mormont

107
00:08:07,914 --> 00:08:10,538
thought you'd never
come back to Westeros.

108
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:14,413
But you are back,

109
00:08:14,414 --> 00:08:18,371
and it's been in your
family for centuries.

110
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,164
It's not right for me to have it.

111
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:25,746
He gave it to you.

112
00:08:25,747 --> 00:08:27,955
I'm not his son.

113
00:08:33,955 --> 00:08:36,122
I brought shame onto my house.

114
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:39,830
I broke my father's heart.

115
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,122
I forfeited the right
to claim this sword.

116
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:48,954
It's yours.

117
00:08:48,955 --> 00:08:51,080
May it serve you well...

118
00:08:52,456 --> 00:08:54,122
and your children after you.

119
00:09:19,997 --> 00:09:22,829
Father used to watch us from up here.

120
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,330
He wouldn't say much.

121
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,704
You probably don't remember.

122
00:09:26,705 --> 00:09:28,705
You were inside knitting all the time.

123
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,456
I remember.

124
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,538
One time, the boys were shooting
arrows with Ser Rodrik.

125
00:09:37,872 --> 00:09:40,163
I came out here after,

126
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:42,413
and Bran had left his bow behind,

127
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:45,038
just lying on the ground.

128
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:47,414
Ser Rodrik would have
cuffed him if he saw.

129
00:09:49,914 --> 00:09:52,996
There was one arrow in the target.

130
00:09:52,997 --> 00:09:56,662
There was no one around, just like now.

131
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,538
No one to stop me.

132
00:10:00,497 --> 00:10:02,163
So I started shooting.

133
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:04,537
And every shot, I had to go up there

134
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:07,830
and get my one arrow and walk
back and shoot it again.

135
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:11,080
I wasn't very good.

136
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:15,621
Finally, I hit the bull's-eye.

137
00:10:15,622 --> 00:10:18,038
Could have been the
20th shot or the 50th.

138
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,496
I don't remember.

139
00:10:19,497 --> 00:10:22,914
But I hit the bull's-eye,
and I heard this.

140
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:26,829
I looked up,

141
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,579
and he's standing right here,

142
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,247
smiling down at me.

143
00:10:32,747 --> 00:10:35,829
I knew what I was doing
was against the rules.

144
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:40,246
But he was smiling, so I
knew it wasn't wrong.

145
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:41,788
The rules were wrong.

146
00:10:43,414 --> 00:10:46,456
I was doing what I was meant
to be doing, and he knew it.

147
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:51,080
Now he's dead.

148
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,829
Killed by the Lannisters

149
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,456
with your help.

150
00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:01,522
What?

151
00:11:11,122 --> 00:11:13,330
That's your pretty handwriting.

152
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:15,163
Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles

153
00:11:15,164 --> 00:11:16,914
'cause I couldn't write as well as you.

154
00:11:18,997 --> 00:11:22,954
"Robb, I write to you
today with heavy heart.

155
00:11:22,955 --> 00:11:25,121
Our good King Robert is dead,

156
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:26,954
killed from wounds he
took in a boar hunt."

157
00:11:26,955 --> 00:11:28,455
You don't have to read it. I remember.

158
00:11:28,456 --> 00:11:30,163
"Father has been charged with treason.

159
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:33,121
He conspired with Robert's brothers
against my beloved Joffrey

160
00:11:33,122 --> 00:11:34,954
and tried to steal his throne.

161
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:36,787
The Lannisters are treating me well

162
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:38,787
and providing me with every comfort.

163
00:11:38,788 --> 00:11:41,121
I beg you, come to King's Landing,

164
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:42,996
swear fealty to King Joffrey,

165
00:11:42,997 --> 00:11:45,205
and prevent any strife
between the great houses

166
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:46,996
of Lannister and Stark.

167
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,205
Your faithful sister, Sansa."

168
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:51,621
They forced me to do it.

169
00:11:51,622 --> 00:11:52,787
Did they?

170
00:11:52,788 --> 00:11:55,079
With a knife at your throat?

171
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,537
Did they put you on a
rack and stretch you

172
00:11:56,538 --> 00:11:58,246
until your bones started to pop?

173
00:11:58,247 --> 00:12:00,163
You don't know what it was like.
I was a child.

174
00:12:00,164 --> 00:12:03,996
So was I. I would have let them kill
me before I betrayed my family.

175
00:12:03,997 --> 00:12:06,829
They told me it was the
only way to save Father.

176
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,372
And you were stupid
enough to believe them.

177
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:14,330
I remember you standing on that
platform with Joffrey and Cersei

178
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:16,038
when they dragged Father to the block.

179
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,662
I remember the pretty
dress you were wearing.

180
00:12:17,663 --> 00:12:20,039
I remember the fancy
way you did your hair.

181
00:12:21,872 --> 00:12:22,996
You were there?

182
00:12:22,997 --> 00:12:24,288
I was there.

183
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:27,163
Standing in the crowd
near Baelor's statue.

184
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,954
And what did you do?

185
00:12:28,955 --> 00:12:31,371
Did you come running to the rescue?

186
00:12:31,372 --> 00:12:34,163
Did you fight off the
Lannisters and save Father?

187
00:12:34,164 --> 00:12:36,787
- I wanted to.
- But you didn't, just like me.

188
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:39,371
I didn't betray him. I
didn't betray Robb.

189
00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:43,039
I didn't betray our entire
family for my beloved Joffrey.

190
00:12:45,372 --> 00:12:48,371
You should be on your
knees, thanking me.

191
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:52,246
We're standing in Winterfell
again because of me.

192
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:54,455
You didn't win it back,
Jon didn't win it back.

193
00:12:54,456 --> 00:12:56,537
He lost the Battle of the Bastards.

194
00:12:56,538 --> 00:12:58,288
The Knights of the Vale won the battle,

195
00:12:58,289 --> 00:12:59,913
and they rode north for me.

196
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:03,205
While you were off, where?
Traveling the world?

197
00:13:03,206 --> 00:13:06,038
- I was training.
- Training.

198
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,913
Well, while you were training,

199
00:13:07,914 --> 00:13:11,163
I suffered things you
could never imagine.

200
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:13,788
Oh, I don't know about that.
I can imagine quite a lot.

201
00:13:15,622 --> 00:13:18,537
You never would have
survived what I survived.

202
00:13:18,538 --> 00:13:21,122
I guess we'll never know.

203
00:13:25,247 --> 00:13:27,080
What are you going to
do with that letter?

204
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,039
I don't know yet.

205
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,371
Who did you show it to?
Where did you find it?

206
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:36,455
You're scared, aren't you?

207
00:13:36,456 --> 00:13:38,579
What are you scared of?

208
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,579
You didn't commit any crimes.

209
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,413
- No one's going to hang you.
- Well, Arya...

210
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:44,871
You're scared I'll show it
to Jon and he'll be angry.

211
00:13:44,872 --> 00:13:48,246
No, that's not Jon. He'll understand.

212
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:50,205
You were just a scared little girl,

213
00:13:50,206 --> 00:13:52,413
all alone with the wicked Lannisters.

214
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:56,288
Do you know how happy Cersei would
be right now if she saw us fighting?

215
00:13:56,289 --> 00:13:58,288
This is exactly what she wants.

216
00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:00,371
This is what she's always wanted...
to tear us apart.

217
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,955
You're scared the Northern
lords will read it.

218
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:06,163
They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa

219
00:14:06,164 --> 00:14:09,163
if they knew how she
did Cersei's bidding.

220
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:12,163
What would little Lyanna Mormont say?

221
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:15,330
She's younger than you
were when you wrote this.

222
00:14:15,331 --> 00:14:17,830
Are you going to say,
"But I was just a child?"

223
00:14:20,538 --> 00:14:22,413
You're angry.

224
00:14:22,414 --> 00:14:25,621
Sometimes anger makes people
do unfortunate things.

225
00:14:25,622 --> 00:14:28,247
Sometimes fear makes them
do unfortunate things.

226
00:14:30,247 --> 00:14:32,122
I'll go with anger.

227
00:15:02,955 --> 00:15:05,038
You're the one they call "the Dog."

228
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,871
Fuck off.

229
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,662
They told me you were mean.

230
00:15:08,663 --> 00:15:11,079
Were you born mean or
you just hate wildings?

231
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,455
I don't give two shits about wildings.

232
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:15,163
It's gingers I hate.

233
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,038
Gingers are beautiful.

234
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,621
We are kissed by fire, just like you.

235
00:15:20,622 --> 00:15:23,538
Don't point your fucking finger at me.

236
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:30,913
Did you trip into the fire
when you were a baby?

237
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:32,662
I didn't trip, I was pushed.

238
00:15:32,663 --> 00:15:34,579
And ever since, you've been mean.

239
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,205
Will you fuck off?

240
00:15:36,206 --> 00:15:38,163
I don't think you're truly mean.

241
00:15:38,164 --> 00:15:39,705
You have sad eyes.

242
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:42,704
You want to suck my dick, is that it?

243
00:15:42,705 --> 00:15:45,413
- Dick?
- Cock.

244
00:15:45,414 --> 00:15:47,413
Ah, dick.

245
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:48,704
I like it.

246
00:15:48,705 --> 00:15:50,746
I bet you do.

247
00:15:50,747 --> 00:15:53,371
Nope, it's pussy for me.

248
00:15:53,372 --> 00:15:56,371
I have a beauty waiting for
me back at Winterfell.

249
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,496
If I ever get back there.

250
00:15:58,497 --> 00:16:01,246
Yellow hair, blue eyes,

251
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:03,455
the tallest woman you've ever seen.

252
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:04,914
Almost as tall as you.

253
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,246
- Brienne of Tarth.
- You know her?

254
00:16:09,247 --> 00:16:11,579
You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?

255
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,954
Well, not with her yet.

256
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:17,579
- But I see the way she looks at me.
- How does she look at you?

257
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,038
Like she wants to carve you
up and eat your liver?

258
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,787
You do know her.

259
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:23,246
We've met.

260
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:25,371
I want to make babies with her.

261
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:28,371
Think of them... great big monsters.

262
00:16:28,372 --> 00:16:29,954
They'd conquer the world.

263
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:33,537
How did a mad fucker
like you live this long?

264
00:16:33,538 --> 00:16:35,289
I'm good at killing people.

265
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,829
You don't look much like him.

266
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,288
Who's that?

267
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:43,330
Your father.

268
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:45,413
I suppose you favor your mother.

269
00:16:45,414 --> 00:16:47,787
You knew him?

270
00:16:47,788 --> 00:16:49,579
'Course I did.

271
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,163
When he was Hand,

272
00:16:51,164 --> 00:16:53,537
he sent me off hunting for the Mountain.

273
00:16:53,538 --> 00:16:54,996
Your wildling friend told me

274
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:57,288
the red woman brought you back.

275
00:16:57,289 --> 00:17:01,455
Thoros has brought me back six times.

276
00:17:01,456 --> 00:17:04,537
We both serve the same lord.

277
00:17:04,538 --> 00:17:06,455
I serve the North.

278
00:17:06,456 --> 00:17:08,496
The North didn't raise
you from the dead.

279
00:17:08,497 --> 00:17:10,496
The Lord of Light never spoke to me.

280
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:11,871
I don't know anything about him.

281
00:17:11,872 --> 00:17:13,496
I don't know what he wants from me.

282
00:17:13,497 --> 00:17:16,871
- He wants you alive.
- Why?

283
00:17:16,872 --> 00:17:19,288
I don't know.

284
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,662
That's all anyone can tell me...
"I don't know."

285
00:17:22,663 --> 00:17:24,496
So, what's the point in serving a god

286
00:17:24,497 --> 00:17:26,996
if none of us knows what he wants?

287
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:29,704
I think about that all the time.

288
00:17:29,705 --> 00:17:32,787
I don't think it's our
purpose to understand.

289
00:17:32,788 --> 00:17:36,163
Except one thing... we're soldiers.

290
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:38,829
We have to know what we're fighting for.

291
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,038
I'm not fighting so some
man or woman I barely know

292
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:45,079
can sit on a throne made of swords.

293
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,496
So, what are you fighting for?

294
00:17:47,497 --> 00:17:48,897
Life.

295
00:17:50,164 --> 00:17:51,996
Death is the enemy.

296
00:17:51,997 --> 00:17:55,289
The first enemy and the last.

297
00:17:57,122 --> 00:17:58,522
But we all die.

298
00:18:00,206 --> 00:18:02,537
The enemy always wins.

299
00:18:02,538 --> 00:18:04,787
And we still need to fight him.

300
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:06,746
That's all I know.

301
00:18:06,747 --> 00:18:10,205
You and I won't find much
joy while we're here,

302
00:18:10,206 --> 00:18:12,455
but we can keep others alive.

303
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:15,247
We can defend those who
can't defend themselves.

304
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:21,455
"I am the shield that
guards the realms of men."

305
00:18:21,456 --> 00:18:25,288
Maybe we don't need to
understand any more than that.

306
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:27,496
Maybe that's enough.

307
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:28,897
Aye.

308
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:32,206
Maybe that's enough.

309
00:18:39,997 --> 00:18:42,580
That's what I saw in the fire.

310
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,788
A mountain like an arrowhead.

311
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:49,122
Are you sure?

312
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,580
We're getting close.

313
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,580
Do you know what I like about you?

314
00:19:05,872 --> 00:19:09,079
- I honestly don't.
- You're not a hero.

315
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,621
Oh.

316
00:19:10,622 --> 00:19:13,413
Well, I've been heroic on occasion.

317
00:19:13,414 --> 00:19:16,205
I once charged through the Mud
Gate of King's Landing and...

318
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:17,996
I don't want you to be a hero.

319
00:19:17,997 --> 00:19:21,288
Heroes do stupid things and they die.

320
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:23,330
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

321
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:26,621
even this... Jon Snow...

322
00:19:26,622 --> 00:19:29,288
they all try to outdo each other.

323
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:31,455
Who can do the stupidest, bravest thing.

324
00:19:31,456 --> 00:19:34,455
It's interesting, these heroes you name.

325
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:36,662
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

326
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:39,579
even this... Jon Snow.

327
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,704
They all fell in love with you.

328
00:19:41,705 --> 00:19:44,662
- Jon Snow's not in love with me.
- Oh, my mistake.

329
00:19:44,663 --> 00:19:46,371
I suppose he stares at you longingly

330
00:19:46,372 --> 00:19:49,289
because he's hopeful for a
successful military alliance.

331
00:19:52,788 --> 00:19:55,246
He's too little for me.

332
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:57,079
I didn't mean...

333
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,246
As heroes go, he is quite little.

334
00:20:00,247 --> 00:20:02,662
I know you're brave.

335
00:20:02,663 --> 00:20:04,622
I wouldn't have chosen
a coward as my Hand.

336
00:20:09,663 --> 00:20:12,537
So, if all goes well,

337
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:14,830
I'll finally get to meet your sister.

338
00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:18,163
From everything you've
told me about her,

339
00:20:18,164 --> 00:20:20,496
she'd rather murder me
than speak with me.

340
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:24,330
Oh, first, she'd torture
you in some horrible way,

341
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:25,731
then she'd murder you.

342
00:20:26,872 --> 00:20:30,371
Nobody trusts my sister
less than I do, believe me.

343
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:32,163
But if we go to the capital,

344
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,996
we'll go with two armies,
we'll go with three dragons.

345
00:20:34,997 --> 00:20:38,746
Anyone touches you, King's Landing
burns down to the foundation stones.

346
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:40,787
And right now, she's thinking
of how to set a trap.

347
00:20:40,788 --> 00:20:42,371
Of course she is.

348
00:20:42,372 --> 00:20:44,662
And she's wondering what
trap you're laying for her.

349
00:20:44,663 --> 00:20:46,121
Are we?

350
00:20:46,122 --> 00:20:48,289
Laying any traps?

351
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:53,621
If we want to create a
new and better world,

352
00:20:53,622 --> 00:20:56,746
I'm not sure deceit and mass
murder is the best way to start.

353
00:20:56,747 --> 00:20:59,538
Which war was won without
deceit and mass murder?

354
00:21:01,206 --> 00:21:03,330
Yes, you'll need to be ruthless

355
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:05,205
if you're going to win the throne.

356
00:21:05,206 --> 00:21:07,246
You need to inspire a degree of fear.

357
00:21:07,247 --> 00:21:09,621
But fear is all Cersei has.

358
00:21:09,622 --> 00:21:12,455
It's all my father had, and Joffrey.

359
00:21:12,456 --> 00:21:14,371
It makes their power brittle

360
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:18,163
because everyone beneath
them longs to see them dead.

361
00:21:18,164 --> 00:21:20,704
Aegon Targaryen got quite
a long way on fear.

362
00:21:20,705 --> 00:21:22,371
He did.

363
00:21:22,372 --> 00:21:24,996
But you once spoke to me
of breaking the wheel.

364
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:26,455
Aegon built a wheel.

365
00:21:26,456 --> 00:21:28,662
If that's the kind of
queen you want to be,

366
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:31,246
how are you different from all the
other tyrants that came before you?

367
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:34,662
So we walk into the lions' den.

368
00:21:34,663 --> 00:21:36,330
My brother promised me he'd keep a grip

369
00:21:36,331 --> 00:21:37,954
on the Lannister forces.

370
00:21:37,955 --> 00:21:41,829
Forgive me, but I don't care
about any Lannister promises.

371
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,121
Except yours.

372
00:21:43,122 --> 00:21:45,246
And I promised him

373
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:47,788
I'd keep you from doing
anything impulsive.

374
00:21:49,206 --> 00:21:50,606
Impulsive?

375
00:21:54,122 --> 00:21:56,829
This will be a difficult negotiation.

376
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,371
We're sitting down with people who
want to see us both headless.

377
00:22:00,372 --> 00:22:02,871
My sister is likely to say
something provocative.

378
00:22:02,872 --> 00:22:05,413
- And?
- And you have been known

379
00:22:05,414 --> 00:22:07,579
to lose your temper from time to time,

380
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,913
as all great leaders do.

381
00:22:08,914 --> 00:22:11,330
When have I lost my temper?

382
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,871
Burning the Tarlys, for instance.

383
00:22:13,872 --> 00:22:15,413
That was not impulsive.

384
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:18,246
That was necessary.

385
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:20,163
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps?

386
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:23,746
Perhaps the father needed
to die and not the son.

387
00:22:23,747 --> 00:22:26,455
Perhaps they both needed time
to contemplate their mistakes

388
00:22:26,456 --> 00:22:28,746
in the solitude of a cold cell.

389
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:31,163
We had no time to discuss
the possibilities

390
00:22:31,164 --> 00:22:33,205
before you ended their possibilities.

391
00:22:33,206 --> 00:22:34,913
One could be forgiven for
thinking you're taking

392
00:22:34,914 --> 00:22:36,746
your family's side in this debate.

393
00:22:36,747 --> 00:22:38,579
I am taking their side.

394
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,288
You need to take your enemy's side

395
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:42,288
if you're going to see
things the way they do.

396
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:44,246
And you need to see
things the way they do

397
00:22:44,247 --> 00:22:46,288
if you're going to
anticipate their actions,

398
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:49,621
respond effectively, and beat them.

399
00:22:49,622 --> 00:22:51,954
Which I want you to do very much.

400
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:55,455
Because I believe in you and in
the world you want to build.

401
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:58,121
But the world you want to build

402
00:22:58,122 --> 00:22:59,704
doesn't get built all at once.

403
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:02,829
Probably not in a single lifetime.

404
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,662
How do we ensure that
your vision endures?

405
00:23:05,663 --> 00:23:08,622
After you break the wheel, how
do we make sure it stays broken?

406
00:23:11,164 --> 00:23:14,496
You want to know who sits on the
Iron Throne after I'm dead.

407
00:23:14,497 --> 00:23:15,897
Is that it?

408
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:19,246
You say you can't have children,

409
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:22,537
but there are other ways
of choosing a successor.

410
00:23:22,538 --> 00:23:24,662
The Night's Watch has one method.

411
00:23:24,663 --> 00:23:27,038
The ironborn, for all their
many flaws, have another.

412
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,746
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

413
00:23:29,747 --> 00:23:31,496
Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows

414
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:33,829
fly towards you when you
fought on the Blackwater Rush,

415
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,913
and I saw hundreds of arrows miss.

416
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,537
But any one of them could have
found your heart and ended your...

417
00:23:38,538 --> 00:23:41,704
You've been thinking about my
death quite a bit, haven't you?

418
00:23:41,705 --> 00:23:43,288
Is this one of the items you discussed

419
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:44,996
with your brother in King's Landing?

420
00:23:44,997 --> 00:23:47,455
I'm trying to serve you by
planning for the long term.

421
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,038
Perhaps if you planned
for the short term,

422
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,080
we wouldn't have lost
Dorne and Highgarden.

423
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:58,372
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

424
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,480
Look!

425
00:24:46,997 --> 00:24:48,397
A bear.

426
00:24:49,747 --> 00:24:51,414
Big fucker.

427
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,247
Do bears have blue eyes?

428
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,747
We have to get him back to Eastwatch.

429
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,480
Flask.

430
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:31,938
Go on.

431
00:27:48,372 --> 00:27:49,621
You all right?

432
00:27:49,622 --> 00:27:53,371
I just got bit by a dead bear.

433
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:56,122
Aye, you did.

434
00:27:57,997 --> 00:27:59,914
Funny old life.

435
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,662
Right, then.

436
00:28:03,663 --> 00:28:05,580
We're off.

437
00:28:31,497 --> 00:28:34,704
- Where did she get it?
- I don't know.

438
00:28:34,705 --> 00:28:36,830
She seems very resourceful.

439
00:28:39,414 --> 00:28:40,913
You're worried.

440
00:28:40,914 --> 00:28:42,579
We're asking 20,000 men

441
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:46,330
to fight with us in the worst
winter any of them have ever seen.

442
00:28:46,331 --> 00:28:49,330
The weather will be the
least of their problems.

443
00:28:49,331 --> 00:28:52,121
Many of them will be happy to
find a good reason to go home.

444
00:28:52,122 --> 00:28:55,621
- You question their loyalty?
- Their loyalty is to Jon.

445
00:28:55,622 --> 00:28:58,246
Jon is not here. I haven't
heard from him in weeks.

446
00:28:58,247 --> 00:29:00,288
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

447
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:02,997
The king chose you to
rule in his absence.

448
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,787
And rule you have.

449
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:10,121
Wisely, ably.

450
00:29:10,122 --> 00:29:12,871
They see that. They respect you.

451
00:29:12,872 --> 00:29:14,288
Some may even prefer you.

452
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:15,704
Yes, they turned their backs on Jon

453
00:29:15,705 --> 00:29:17,121
when it was time to retake Winterfell,

454
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,787
then they named him their king,

455
00:29:18,788 --> 00:29:20,662
and now they're ready to turn
their backs on him again.

456
00:29:20,663 --> 00:29:22,913
How far would you trust men like that?

457
00:29:22,914 --> 00:29:24,996
They're all bloody wind vanes.

458
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:27,038
If they found out that
I wrote that letter,

459
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,537
a woman who's already married

460
00:29:28,538 --> 00:29:32,079
not one, but two enemies of her house...

461
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,121
By the time Jon comes back,
he'll have no army left.

462
00:29:35,122 --> 00:29:36,914
Arya's not like them.

463
00:29:39,331 --> 00:29:40,746
She's your sister.

464
00:29:40,747 --> 00:29:42,537
You may have disagreements,

465
00:29:42,538 --> 00:29:44,996
but she would never betray her family.

466
00:29:44,997 --> 00:29:47,537
She would if she thought I
was going to betray Jon.

467
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:49,455
Is that what she thinks?

468
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:51,371
I don't know what she thinks.

469
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,414
I don't know her anymore.

470
00:29:55,705 --> 00:29:58,247
Perhaps Lady Brienne could help.

471
00:30:00,705 --> 00:30:04,704
She's sworn to protect both
of Catelyn Stark's girls,

472
00:30:04,705 --> 00:30:06,105
is she not?

473
00:30:07,538 --> 00:30:08,955
She is.

474
00:30:13,414 --> 00:30:17,288
And if one of you were planning
to harm the other in any way,

475
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:19,414
wouldn't she be honor
bound to intercede?

476
00:30:22,456 --> 00:30:23,914
She would.

477
00:30:36,955 --> 00:30:40,371
- Something I've always wanted to know.
- All right.

478
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:44,621
How drunk were you when you charged
through the breach on Pyke?

479
00:30:44,622 --> 00:30:48,414
If I'm being honest, I don't remember
charging through the breach.

480
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:53,954
Some of the lads told me
about it the next morning.

481
00:30:53,955 --> 00:30:56,330
Sounded like a good scrap.

482
00:30:56,331 --> 00:30:58,621
Aye.

483
00:30:58,622 --> 00:31:00,913
It was a proper scrap.

484
00:31:00,914 --> 00:31:04,288
The ironborn thought you
were some kind of god,

485
00:31:04,289 --> 00:31:06,622
the way you were waving
that flaming sword.

486
00:31:07,997 --> 00:31:11,704
I thought you were the
bravest man I ever saw.

487
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:13,580
Just the drunkest.

488
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:55,787
Where's the rest of them?

489
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:58,039
If we wait long enough, we'll find out.

490
00:34:28,164 --> 00:34:29,704
Run back to Eastwatch.

491
00:34:29,705 --> 00:34:31,913
Get a raven to Daenerys,
tell her what's happened.

492
00:34:31,914 --> 00:34:35,289
- I'm not leaving you.
- You're the fastest. Go, now.

493
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:39,205
You're faster without the hammer.
Give it.

494
00:34:39,206 --> 00:34:40,606
Give it!

495
00:34:48,414 --> 00:34:51,038
- Come on!
- Run!

496
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:52,538
Come on!

497
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,580
Stop!

498
00:35:18,331 --> 00:35:19,731
Go!

499
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:09,371
What happened?

500
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:10,871
Where are the others?

501
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:14,079
Raven, we need to send a raven.

502
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,872
Get the maester, now!

503
00:38:57,331 --> 00:38:58,731
Thoros?

504
00:39:02,122 --> 00:39:03,580
Thoros.

505
00:39:21,705 --> 00:39:23,914
They say it's one of
the better ways to go.

506
00:39:37,788 --> 00:39:42,455
Lord of Light, show us the way.

507
00:39:42,456 --> 00:39:45,997
Come to us in our darkness and
lead Your servant into the light.

508
00:39:51,414 --> 00:39:53,372
We have to burn his body.

509
00:39:56,414 --> 00:39:58,787
We'll all be close behind him

510
00:39:58,788 --> 00:40:02,663
unless the Lord of Light is kind
enough to send us a bit of fire.

511
00:40:11,705 --> 00:40:14,205
Lord of Light,

512
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:16,871
come to us in our darkness,

513
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,580
for the night is dark
and full of terrors.

514
00:40:43,497 --> 00:40:45,372
We'll all freeze soon.

515
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,497
And so will the water.

516
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:55,205
When you killed the white walker,

517
00:40:55,206 --> 00:40:59,079
almost all the dead
that followed it fell.

518
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,954
Why?

519
00:41:00,955 --> 00:41:03,205
Maybe he was the one who turned them.

520
00:41:03,206 --> 00:41:06,579
We can go for the walkers.

521
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,372
No.

522
00:41:10,914 --> 00:41:13,705
We need to take that thing back with us.

523
00:41:16,872 --> 00:41:19,330
There's a raven flying
for Dragonstone now.

524
00:41:19,331 --> 00:41:22,746
Daenerys is our only chance.

525
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:25,705
No. There's another.

526
00:41:28,372 --> 00:41:29,772
Kill him.

527
00:41:30,872 --> 00:41:32,580
He turned them all.

528
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:38,314
You don't understand.

529
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,496
The Lord brought you back.

530
00:41:41,497 --> 00:41:43,704
He brought me back.

531
00:41:43,705 --> 00:41:46,787
No one else. Just us.

532
00:41:46,788 --> 00:41:49,164
Did He do it to watch
us freeze to death?

533
00:41:51,622 --> 00:41:54,829
Careful, Beric. You lost your priest.

534
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,621
This is your last life.

535
00:41:56,622 --> 00:41:59,704
I've been waiting for the
end for a long time.

536
00:41:59,705 --> 00:42:02,371
Maybe the Lord brought
me here to find it.

537
00:42:02,372 --> 00:42:06,246
Every lord I've ever met's been a cunt.

538
00:42:06,247 --> 00:42:09,122
Don't see why the Lord of Light
should be any different.

539
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,731
My lady.

540
00:42:33,955 --> 00:42:35,871
My lady?

541
00:42:35,872 --> 00:42:39,997
It's an invitation to King's Landing.

542
00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:48,330
My lady, you are the Lady of Winterfell.

543
00:42:48,331 --> 00:42:50,913
I am, and you will
represent my interests

544
00:42:50,914 --> 00:42:52,496
at this gathering as you see them.

545
00:42:52,497 --> 00:42:55,872
They invited you. They want you there.

546
00:42:57,372 --> 00:42:59,413
I will not set foot in King's Landing

547
00:42:59,414 --> 00:43:01,996
while Cersei Lannister is queen.

548
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:03,704
If they want another Stark prisoner,

549
00:43:03,705 --> 00:43:05,496
they can come and take me.

550
00:43:05,497 --> 00:43:08,246
Until then, I'll remain where I belong.

551
00:43:08,247 --> 00:43:10,163
I have work to do here.

552
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,787
It's not safe.

553
00:43:14,788 --> 00:43:16,621
Ser Jaime will be there.

554
00:43:16,622 --> 00:43:19,205
You said he treated
you honorably before.

555
00:43:19,206 --> 00:43:21,205
I'm not worried about me.

556
00:43:21,206 --> 00:43:24,371
It's not safe leaving
you with Littlefinger.

557
00:43:24,372 --> 00:43:26,662
I have many guards who would happily

558
00:43:26,663 --> 00:43:28,121
imprison him or behead him

559
00:43:28,122 --> 00:43:29,496
whether or not you're here.

560
00:43:29,497 --> 00:43:31,704
And you trust their loyalty?

561
00:43:31,705 --> 00:43:35,371
You trust he hasn't been speaking
to them all behind your back?

562
00:43:35,372 --> 00:43:38,746
Let me at least leave Podrick
behind to watch over you.

563
00:43:38,747 --> 00:43:40,371
He has become a competent swordsman...

564
00:43:40,372 --> 00:43:44,829
I do not need to be watched
over or minded or cared for.

565
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,079
I'm not a child,

566
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,996
I am the Lady of
Winterfell, and I am home.

567
00:43:48,997 --> 00:43:51,039
This is the safest place for me.

568
00:43:52,372 --> 00:43:54,537
My lady,

569
00:43:54,538 --> 00:43:58,394
I swore an oath to protect you and
your sister. If I abandon you...

570
00:43:58,395 --> 00:44:00,545
The trip to King's Landing
is long, Lady Brienne,

571
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:03,121
and you won't be traveling
on summer roads.

572
00:44:03,122 --> 00:44:06,247
The sooner you leave, the better
your chances of making it on time.

573
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:11,147
Yes, my lady.

574
00:44:33,997 --> 00:44:35,954
You can't.

575
00:44:35,955 --> 00:44:37,829
The most important person in the world

576
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:40,537
can't fly off to the most
dangerous place in the world.

577
00:44:40,538 --> 00:44:42,579
- Who else can?
- No one.

578
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,579
They knew the risks when they left.

579
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,122
You can't win the throne if you're dead.

580
00:44:47,622 --> 00:44:49,662
You can't break the
wheel if you're dead.

581
00:44:49,663 --> 00:44:51,954
So, what would you have me do?

582
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:53,746
Nothing.

583
00:44:53,747 --> 00:44:55,830
Sometimes nothing is the
hardest thing to do.

584
00:44:58,206 --> 00:45:01,622
If you die, we're all lost.

585
00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:06,537
Everyone, everything.

586
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:10,205
You told me to do nothing
before and I listened to you.

587
00:45:10,206 --> 00:45:11,997
I'm not doing nothing again.

588
00:46:08,705 --> 00:46:10,830
Dumb cunt.

589
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,414
Oh, fuck.

590
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,497
Fuck it.

591
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,397
Yah!

592
00:48:47,372 --> 00:48:48,772
Yah!

593
00:49:08,414 --> 00:49:09,814
Fall back!

594
00:49:11,331 --> 00:49:14,164
- Fall back!
- Come on!

595
00:49:40,414 --> 00:49:42,330
Help me!

596
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,480
Go!

597
00:52:54,497 --> 00:52:55,897
Jon!

598
00:54:46,164 --> 00:54:47,662
Go!

599
00:54:47,663 --> 00:54:50,164
Go now! Leave!

600
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,038
Uncle Benjen!

601
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:50,439
How?

602
00:57:52,622 --> 00:57:55,371
- You ride for the pass.
- Come with me.

603
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:57,330
There's no time.

604
00:57:57,331 --> 00:57:59,206
Go!

605
00:59:13,622 --> 00:59:15,496
We'll meet again, Clegane.

606
00:59:15,497 --> 00:59:17,830
Fucking hope not.

607
00:59:47,456 --> 00:59:49,663
It's time to go, Your Grace.

608
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,039
A bit longer.

609
01:00:16,872 --> 01:00:18,914
Rider approaching!

610
01:00:27,414 --> 01:00:29,621
Open the gate!

611
01:02:11,788 --> 01:02:13,788
Not what you're looking for?

612
01:02:15,538 --> 01:02:18,955
I have hundreds of men here at
Winterfell, all loyal to me.

613
01:02:20,747 --> 01:02:22,456
They're not here now.

614
01:02:24,955 --> 01:02:27,205
What are these?

615
01:02:27,206 --> 01:02:28,622
My faces.

616
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,954
Where did you get them?

617
01:02:32,955 --> 01:02:37,205
In Braavos, while I was
training to be a Faceless Man.

618
01:02:37,206 --> 01:02:39,372
What does that mean?

619
01:02:41,955 --> 01:02:43,871
Back in Braavos,

620
01:02:43,872 --> 01:02:46,537
before I got my first face,

621
01:02:46,538 --> 01:02:48,871
there was a game I used to play.

622
01:02:48,872 --> 01:02:51,079
The Game of Faces.

623
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,871
It's simple...

624
01:02:52,872 --> 01:02:55,371
I ask you a question about yourself,

625
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:58,787
and you try to make lies
sound like the truth.

626
01:02:58,788 --> 01:03:01,829
If you fool me, you win.

627
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:05,496
If I catch a lie, you lose.

628
01:03:05,497 --> 01:03:07,704
Let's play.

629
01:03:07,705 --> 01:03:10,787
I don't want to play.

630
01:03:10,788 --> 01:03:14,579
How do you feel about Jon being king?

631
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:17,746
Is there someone else you think
should rule the North instead of him?

632
01:03:17,747 --> 01:03:21,662
Those faces, what are they?

633
01:03:21,663 --> 01:03:24,038
You want to do the asking?

634
01:03:24,039 --> 01:03:26,079
Are you sure?

635
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,913
The Game of Faces
didn't turn out so well

636
01:03:27,914 --> 01:03:29,662
for the last person who
asked me questions.

637
01:03:29,663 --> 01:03:31,622
Tell me what they are.

638
01:03:34,747 --> 01:03:37,914
We both wanted to be other
people when we were younger.

639
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:41,455
You wanted to be a queen,

640
01:03:41,456 --> 01:03:44,747
to sit next to a handsome,
young king on the Iron Throne.

641
01:03:46,247 --> 01:03:48,537
I wanted to be a knight,

642
01:03:48,538 --> 01:03:51,622
to pick up a sword like
Father and go off to battle.

643
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:57,787
Neither of us got to be
that other person, did we?

644
01:03:57,788 --> 01:04:01,414
The world doesn't just let girls
decide what they're going to be.

645
01:04:02,788 --> 01:04:04,413
But I can now.

646
01:04:04,414 --> 01:04:07,537
With the faces, I can choose.

647
01:04:07,538 --> 01:04:09,830
I can become someone else.

648
01:04:11,289 --> 01:04:13,621
Speak in their voice,

649
01:04:13,622 --> 01:04:15,247
live in their skin.

650
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:20,456
I could even become you.

651
01:04:27,955 --> 01:04:30,662
I wonder what it would feel like

652
01:04:30,663 --> 01:04:32,830
to wear those pretty dresses...

653
01:04:34,622 --> 01:04:37,039
to be the Lady of Winterfell.

654
01:04:39,497 --> 01:04:41,830
All I'd need to find out...

655
01:04:43,955 --> 01:04:45,355
is your face.

656
01:05:43,914 --> 01:05:45,538
I'm sorry.

657
01:05:47,872 --> 01:05:49,663
I'm so sorry.

658
01:06:01,247 --> 01:06:03,538
I wish I could take it back.

659
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:07,580
I wish we'd never gone.

660
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,580
I don't.

661
01:06:14,247 --> 01:06:16,580
If we hadn't gone, I wouldn't have seen.

662
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:20,538
You have to see it to know.

663
01:06:22,331 --> 01:06:23,914
Now I know.

664
01:06:27,289 --> 01:06:30,246
The dragons are my children.

665
01:06:30,247 --> 01:06:32,913
They're the only
children I'll ever have.

666
01:06:32,914 --> 01:06:34,538
Do you understand?

667
01:06:40,331 --> 01:06:44,746
We are going to destroy the
Night King and his army.

668
01:06:44,747 --> 01:06:46,622
And we'll do it together.

669
01:06:48,538 --> 01:06:50,580
You have my word.

670
01:06:53,955 --> 01:06:55,414
Thank you, Dany.

671
01:06:57,247 --> 01:06:58,621
"Dany"?

672
01:07:00,122 --> 01:07:02,289
Who was the last person
who called me that?

673
01:07:04,122 --> 01:07:06,954
I'm not sure. Was it my brother?

674
01:07:06,955 --> 01:07:09,788
Mm, not the company you want to keep.

675
01:07:10,955 --> 01:07:12,497
All right.

676
01:07:14,289 --> 01:07:15,689
Not "Dany."

677
01:07:19,788 --> 01:07:21,788
How about "my queen"?

678
01:07:25,247 --> 01:07:28,621
I'd, uh, bend the knee, but...

679
01:07:28,622 --> 01:07:31,787
What about those who
swore allegiance to you?

680
01:07:31,788 --> 01:07:34,997
They'll all come to see
you for what you are.

681
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:52,497
I hope I deserve it.

682
01:07:54,497 --> 01:07:56,331
You do.

683
01:08:16,872 --> 01:08:18,538
You should get some rest.
