1
00:00:00,727 --> 00:00:02,930
Still not far
<i>from Pentos, Your Grace.</i>

2
00:00:02,968 --> 00:00:04,320
You'd be more
comfortable there.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,807
I have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.

4
00:00:06,842 --> 00:00:08,642
I'll stay with Drogo
until he fulfills

5
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:11,276
his end of the bargain
and I have my crown.

6
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,046
I have something for you.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,981
First lesson: Stick them
with the pointy end.

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,252
17 years ago you rode off
with Robert Baratheon.

9
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:23,988
- <i>And now you're leaving again.</i>
- <i>I have no choice.</i>

10
00:00:24,022 --> 00:00:26,389
There's great honor serving
in the Night's Watch.

11
00:00:26,424 --> 00:00:28,958
The Starks have manned the
Wall for thousands of years.

12
00:00:28,992 --> 00:00:30,626
<i>And you are a Stark.</i>

13
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:33,931
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

14
00:00:33,966 --> 00:00:36,500
What of it?
Tell me we're not speaking of this.

15
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:39,937
I'll kill every Targaryen
I get my hands on.

16
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:43,641
Rapers. Not impressed
by your new brothers?

17
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:45,543
<i>Lovely thing about the watch--</i>

18
00:00:45,577 --> 00:00:49,112
<i>You discard your old family</i>
<i>and get a whole new one.</i>

19
00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:50,947
Welcome.

20
00:00:50,982 --> 00:00:53,517
I don't think Bran
fell from that tower.

21
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:55,852
I think he was thrown.
No!

22
00:00:55,886 --> 00:00:58,721
<i>Someone tried</i>
<i>to kill him twice.</i>

23
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:01,189
<i>I would stake my life</i>
<i>the Lannisters are involved.</i>

24
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:05,293
- Lord Stark must be told of this.
- <i>I will go myself.</i>

25
00:01:05,327 --> 00:01:07,227
What is the meaning of this?

26
00:01:07,262 --> 00:01:09,230
<i>Joff told us what happened.</i>

27
00:01:09,264 --> 00:01:12,700
<i>You and that boy beat him with clubs while</i>
<i>you set your wolf on him.</i>

28
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:14,535
<i>That's not what happened!</i>

29
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,703
Ahh!

30
00:01:15,738 --> 00:01:18,173
We found no trace of the
direwolf, Your Grace.

31
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:21,244
- We have another wolf.
- As you will.

32
00:01:21,278 --> 00:01:23,112
He doesn't mean Lady, does he?

33
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:25,749
<i>Lady didn't bite anyone!</i>
<i>She's good!</i>

34
00:01:35,926 --> 00:01:46,000
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

35
00:03:43,248 --> 00:03:45,115
Welcome, Lord Stark.

36
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,984
Grand Maester Pycelle has called
a meeting of the small council.

37
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,119
The honor of your
presence is requested.

38
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:54,724
Get the girls settled in.
I'll be back in time for supper.

39
00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:57,393
- And, Jory, you go with them.
- Yes, My Lord.

40
00:03:57,428 --> 00:04:01,164
If you'd like to change into
something more appropriate...

41
00:04:37,335 --> 00:04:39,670
Thank the gods
you're here, Stark.

42
00:04:40,638 --> 00:04:44,163
About time we had some stern
northern leadership.

43
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,777
About glad to see you're
protecting the throne.

44
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:48,845
Sturdy old thing.

45
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,348
How many kings' asses
have polished it, I wonder?

46
00:04:51,383 --> 00:04:53,383
Um, what's the line?

47
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,521
The King shits
and the Hand wipes.

48
00:04:56,555 --> 00:05:00,025
Very handsome armor.

49
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:02,461
- Not a scratch on it.
- I know.

50
00:05:02,495 --> 00:05:06,032
People have been swinging at me for
years, but they always seem to miss.

51
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:08,935
You've chosen your
opponents wisely then.

52
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:12,206
I have a knack for it.

53
00:05:15,343 --> 00:05:18,478
It must be strange for you
coming into this room.

54
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:23,717
I was standing right here
when it happened.

55
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:26,786
He was very brave,
your brother.

56
00:05:26,821 --> 00:05:28,622
Your father too.

57
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:30,790
They didn't deserve
to die like that.

58
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:33,693
Nobody deserves
to die like that.

59
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:35,595
But you just stood there
and watched.

60
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,599
500 men just stood there
and watched.

61
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:41,402
All the great knights
of the Seven Kingdoms--

62
00:05:41,436 --> 00:05:43,837
You think anyone said a
word, lifted a finger?

63
00:05:43,872 --> 00:05:46,473
No, Lord Stark.

64
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:51,111
500 men and this room
was silent as a crypt.

65
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,249
Except for the screams,
of course,

66
00:05:55,283 --> 00:05:58,118
and the Mad King laughing.

67
00:05:58,153 --> 00:06:00,888
And later...

68
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:03,556
When I watched
the Mad King die,

69
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,959
I remembered him laughing
as your father burned...

70
00:06:08,262 --> 00:06:09,929
It felt like justice.

71
00:06:12,933 --> 00:06:15,601
Is that what you
tell yourself at night?

72
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,406
You're a servant of justice?

73
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,508
That you were avenging
my father when you

74
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:24,112
shoved your sword in
Aerys Targaryen's back?

75
00:06:24,146 --> 00:06:25,914
Tell me--

76
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:28,984
If I'd stabbed the Mad King in
the belly instead of the back,

77
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:31,588
would you admire me more?

78
00:06:31,622 --> 00:06:34,157
You served him well

79
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:37,127
when serving was safe.

80
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:51,209
Lord Stark.

81
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:55,446
Lord Varys.

82
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,849
I was grievously sorry to hear of
your troubles on the Kingsroad.

83
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:02,519
We are all praying for prince
Joffrey's full recovery.

84
00:07:02,554 --> 00:07:05,989
A shame you didn't say a
prayer for the butcher's son.

85
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:10,426
Renly!
You're looking well.

86
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,228
And you look
tired from the road.

87
00:07:12,262 --> 00:07:14,430
I told them this meeting
could wait another day, but--

88
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:17,233
<i>But we have a kingdom</i>
<i>to look after.</i>

89
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:20,536
I've hoped to meet you
for some time, Lord Stark.

90
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,173
- No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
- She has, Lord Baelish.

91
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:27,276
I understand you knew
my brother Brandon as well.

92
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,546
All too well.
I still carry a token of his esteem

93
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,549
from navel to collarbone.

94
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,651
Perhaps you chose
the wrong man to duel with.

95
00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:36,653
It wasn't the <i>man</i>
that I chose, My Lord.

96
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:39,056
It was Catelyn Tully.

97
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:42,427
A woman worth fighting for,
I'm sure you'll agree.

98
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:45,130
I humbly beg your pardon,
my Lord Stark.

99
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,800
Grand Maester.

100
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,036
How many years has it been?

101
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:53,740
- <i>You were a young man.</i>
- And you served another King.

102
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:58,311
Oh, how forgetful of me.

103
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:02,181
This belongs to you, now.

104
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,553
<i>Should we begin?</i>

105
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:09,623
- Without the King?
- Winter may be coming,

106
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:12,960
but I'm afraid the same cannot
be said for my brother.

107
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:15,061
His Grace has many cares.

108
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:18,097
He entrusts some
small matters to us

109
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,932
that we might lighten the load.

110
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,868
We are the lords
of small matters here.

111
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,308
<i>My brother instructs us</i>
<i>to stage a tournament</i>

112
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,178
in honor of Lord Stark's
appointment as Hand of the King.

113
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:36,882
- Mmm, how much?
- 40,000 gold dragons to the champion,

114
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,617
<i>20,000 to the runner-up,</i>

115
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:41,787
20,000 to the winning archer.

116
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:44,124
Can the treasury bear
such expense?

117
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,094
I'll have to borrow it.
The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect.

118
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:50,064
We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold.
What's another 80,000?

119
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:52,232
Are you telling me the Crown
is three million in debt?

120
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:54,334
I'm telling you the Crown
is <i>six</i> million in debt.

121
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,269
How could you let this happen?

122
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,070
The Master of Coin
finds the money.

123
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:00,539
The King and the Hand spend it.

124
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:02,308
I will not believe Jon Arryn

125
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,143
allowed Robert
to bankrupt the realm.

126
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:07,146
Lord Arryn gave wise
and prudent advice,

127
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,448
but I fear His Grace

128
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:13,385
- doesn't always listen.
- "Counting coppers," he calls it.

129
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,787
I'll speak to him tomorrow.

130
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,690
This tournament is an
extravagance we cannot afford.

131
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,092
As you will.
But still, we'd best make our plans.

132
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:23,260
There will be no plans

133
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:25,629
until I speak to Robert.

134
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,167
Forgive me, my Lords.
I'm--

135
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:34,871
- <i>I had a long ride.</i>
- You are the King's Hand,

136
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:38,475
Lord Stark, we serve
at your pleasure.

137
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,586
- Ow!
- Please, it's nearly healed.

138
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:53,426
- It's ugly.
- A King should have scars

139
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,263
you fought off a direwolf.
You're a warrior like your father.

140
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,599
I'm not like him.
I didn't fight off anything.

141
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,635
It bit me and all
I did was scream.

142
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:03,937
And the two Stark girls
saw it, both of them.

143
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:07,041
That's not true.
You killed the beast.

144
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:10,277
You only spared the girl because of the
love your father bears her father.

145
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:11,138
I didn't, I--

146
00:10:11,258 --> 00:10:13,328
When Aerys Targaryen
sat on the Iron Throne,

147
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:15,916
your father was a rebel
and a traitor.

148
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:20,320
Someday you'll sit on the throne and
the truth will be what you make it.

149
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,790
Do I have to marry her?

150
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,625
Yes.

151
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:31,028
She's very beautiful and young.

152
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:34,298
If you don't like her, you only
need to see her on formal occasions

153
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:38,235
and when the time comes, to make
little princes and princesses.

154
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:43,408
And if you'd rather fuck painted
whores, you'll fuck painted whores.

155
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,544
And if you'd rather lie with
noble virgins, so be it.

156
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:48,612
You are my darling boy
and the world will be

157
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:50,881
exactly as you want it to be.

158
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,354
Do something nice
for the Stark girl.

159
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:58,657
- I don't want to.
- No, but you will.

160
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:02,761
The occasional kindness will spare you
all sorts of trouble down the road.

161
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,831
We allow the northerners
too much power.

162
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,234
They consider themselves
our equals.

163
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,403
How would you handle them?

164
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,605
I'd double their taxes

165
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,141
and command them to supply
10,000 men to the royal army.

166
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,444
- A royal army?
- Why should every lord command his own men?

167
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,812
It's primitive, no better
than the hill tribes.

168
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,782
We should have a standing army
of men loyal to the Crown,

169
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:26,650
trained by
experienced soldiers--

170
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:30,287
Instead of a mob of peasants who've
never held pikes in their lives.

171
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:32,889
And if the northerners rebel?

172
00:11:32,923 --> 00:11:34,558
I'd crush them.

173
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:37,294
Seize Winterfell and install
someone loyal to the realm

174
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:40,263
as Warden of the North.
Uncle Kevan, maybe.

175
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:43,967
And these 10,000 northern troops, would
they fight for you or their lord?

176
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:46,436
- For me. I'm their King.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

177
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,571
But you've just
invaded their homeland,

178
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:51,373
- asked them to kill their brothers.
- I'm not asking.

179
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:54,410
The North cannot be held--
not by an outsider.

180
00:11:54,444 --> 00:11:57,079
It's too big and too wild.
And when the winter comes,

181
00:11:57,113 --> 00:12:00,449
the seven gods together couldn't
save you and your royal army.

182
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:03,451
A good King knows
when to save his strength...

183
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:07,288
And when to destroy
his enemies.

184
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:10,057
So you agree...

185
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:12,493
The Starks are enemies?

186
00:12:14,496 --> 00:12:17,231
Everyone who isn't us

187
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:19,267
is an enemy.

188
00:12:21,537 --> 00:12:24,139
Enough of that, young lady.
Eat your food.

189
00:12:24,174 --> 00:12:26,075
- I'm practicing.
- Practicing for what?

190
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,177
- The prince.
- <i>Arya, stop!</i>

191
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:31,381
He's a liar and a coward
and he killed my friend.

192
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:33,208
The Hound killed your friend.

193
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:35,266
The Hound does whatever
the prince tells him to do.

194
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:37,988
- You're an idiot.
- You're a liar, and if you told the truth

195
00:12:38,022 --> 00:12:40,724
- Mycah would be alive.
- Enough!

196
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:44,027
What's happening here?

197
00:12:44,061 --> 00:12:47,363
Arya would rather act
like a beast than a lady.

198
00:12:49,032 --> 00:12:51,367
Go to your room.
We'll speak later.

199
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,179
That's for you, love.

200
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,425
<i>The same dollmaker makes all</i>
<i>of Princess Myrcella's toys.</i>

201
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,264
Don't you like it?

202
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,201
I haven't played with dolls
since I was eight.

203
00:13:22,637 --> 00:13:25,372
- May I be excused?
- You've barely eaten a thing.

204
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:29,077
It's all right.
Go on.

205
00:13:38,286 --> 00:13:40,720
War was easier than daughters.

206
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,425
Go away!

207
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,027
<i>Arya, open the door.</i>

208
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:02,272
May I come in?

209
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:11,414
- Whose sword is that?
- Mine.

210
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:13,283
Give it to me.

211
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,894
I know this maker's mark.
This is Mikken's work.

212
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,832
Where did you get this?

213
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:32,972
This is no toy.

214
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:37,776
- Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
- I wasn't playing.

215
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,744
And I don't want to be a lady.

216
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,179
Come here.

217
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,753
Now what do you want with this?

218
00:14:49,787 --> 00:14:51,688
It's called Needle.

219
00:14:51,722 --> 00:14:54,358
Oh, a blade with a name.

220
00:14:55,593 --> 00:14:58,295
And who were you hoping
to skewer with Needle?

221
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:00,064
Your sister?

222
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:02,466
Do you know the first thing
about sword fighting?

223
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,268
Stick 'em with the pointy end.

224
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:07,304
That's the essence of it.

225
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:12,176
I was trying to learn.

226
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:16,781
I asked Mycah
to practice with me.

227
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,253
I asked him.

228
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:24,157
- It was my fault.
- No, sweet girl.

229
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:27,694
No no, you didn't kill
the butcher's boy.

230
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:32,132
I hate them!
I hate all of them.

231
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,768
The Hound, the Queen
and the King

232
00:15:34,802 --> 00:15:36,309
and Joffrey and Sansa.

233
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:39,955
Sansa was dragged before
the King and Queen...

234
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:42,709
And asked to call
the prince a liar.

235
00:15:42,744 --> 00:15:45,245
So was I!
He <i>is</i> a liar.

236
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,381
Shh, darling, listen to me.

237
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,886
Sansa will be married
to Joffrey's someday.

238
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,222
She cannot betray him.

239
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:57,092
She must take his side
even when he's wrong.

240
00:15:58,361 --> 00:16:01,030
But how you can let her
marry someone like that?

241
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:04,834
Well.

242
00:16:06,437 --> 00:16:08,939
Look at me.

243
00:16:08,973 --> 00:16:12,242
You're a Stark of Winterfell.
You know our words.

244
00:16:14,378 --> 00:16:15,812
Winter is coming.

245
00:16:17,113 --> 00:16:19,515
You were born
in the long summer.

246
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:21,650
You've never known
anything else.

247
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:23,718
But now winter is truly coming.

248
00:16:23,753 --> 00:16:26,654
And in the winter,
we must protect ourselves,

249
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:31,125
look after one another.
Sansa is your sister.

250
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,729
I don't hate her.

251
00:16:34,763 --> 00:16:36,931
Not really.

252
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:40,167
I don't want to frighten you,

253
00:16:40,202 --> 00:16:42,036
but I won't lie to you either.

254
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,472
We've come
to a dangerous place.

255
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:48,143
We cannot fight a war
amongst ourselves.

256
00:16:49,045 --> 00:16:51,046
All right?

257
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,016
Go on.
It's yours.

258
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,420
I can keep it?

259
00:16:59,454 --> 00:17:02,623
Try not to stab
your sister with it.

260
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,565
If you're going to own a sword,

261
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,467
you'd better
know how to use it.

262
00:17:23,274 --> 00:17:26,909
Don't listen to it.
Crows are all liars.

263
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:32,748
- I know a story about a crow.
- I hate your stories.

264
00:17:32,783 --> 00:17:36,620
I know a story about a boy
who hated stories.

265
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:40,024
I could tell you about
Ser Duncan the Tall.

266
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:42,026
Those were always
your favorites.

267
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,429
Those weren't my favorites.

268
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,099
My favorites were
the scary ones.

269
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:52,705
Oh, my sweet summer child.
What do you know about fear?

270
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:55,975
Fear is for the winter,

271
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,979
when the snows fall
a hundred feet deep.

272
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:01,115
Fear is for the long night,

273
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:04,118
when the sun hides for years

274
00:18:04,152 --> 00:18:06,888
and children are born
and live and die

275
00:18:06,923 --> 00:18:09,624
all in darkness.

276
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:12,694
That is the time for fear,
my little Lord,

277
00:18:12,729 --> 00:18:16,064
when the white walkers
move through the woods.

278
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:20,602
Thousands of years ago
there came a night

279
00:18:20,637 --> 00:18:22,738
that lasted a generation.

280
00:18:22,772 --> 00:18:25,708
Kings froze to death
in their castles,

281
00:18:25,742 --> 00:18:27,976
same as the shepherds
in their huts.

282
00:18:28,011 --> 00:18:30,880
And women smothered
their babies

283
00:18:30,914 --> 00:18:33,049
<i>rather than see them starve,</i>

284
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:37,086
and wept and felt the tears
freeze on their cheeks.

285
00:18:37,121 --> 00:18:40,824
So is this the sort
of story that you like?

286
00:18:43,862 --> 00:18:45,963
In that darkness,

287
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:48,500
the White Walkers
came for the first time.

288
00:18:48,534 --> 00:18:51,669
<i>They swept through cities</i>
<i>and kingdoms,</i>

289
00:18:51,704 --> 00:18:53,871
<i>riding their dead horses,</i>

290
00:18:53,905 --> 00:18:57,841
hunting with their packs of
pale spiders big as hounds--

291
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,406
What are you telling him now?

292
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:06,615
Only what what are the little
lord wants to hear.

293
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:11,885
Get your supper.
I want some time with him.

294
00:19:19,896 --> 00:19:22,298
One time she told me

295
00:19:22,332 --> 00:19:24,601
the sky is blue because
we live inside the eye

296
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:27,470
of a blue-eyed giant
named Macomber.

297
00:19:27,505 --> 00:19:29,739
Maybe we do.

298
00:19:32,075 --> 00:19:34,410
How do you feel?

299
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,914
You still don't
remember anything?

300
00:19:41,851 --> 00:19:43,852
Bran,

301
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:46,053
I've seen you climb
a thousand times.

302
00:19:46,088 --> 00:19:47,955
In the wind, in the rain--

303
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,090
A thousand times.

304
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:52,492
- You never fall.
- I did though.

305
00:19:55,463 --> 00:19:57,730
It's true, isn't it,

306
00:19:57,765 --> 00:20:01,101
what Maester Luwin
says about my legs?

307
00:20:08,576 --> 00:20:10,611
I'd rather be dead.

308
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:15,117
- Don't ever say that.
- I'd rather be dead.

309
00:20:26,764 --> 00:20:29,400
Fewer eyes back here, My Lady.

310
00:20:29,434 --> 00:20:31,435
But still too many.

311
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:34,104
It's nine years since I've
set foot in the capital.

312
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:37,507
And no one knew who I was the
last time I came either.

313
00:20:41,044 --> 00:20:43,545
My Lady.

314
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,848
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
Would you mind following us?

315
00:20:46,883 --> 00:20:48,749
I would.
We've done nothing wrong.

316
00:20:48,784 --> 00:20:51,085
We've been instructed to
escort you into the city.

317
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,920
Instructed?

318
00:20:52,955 --> 00:20:55,657
I don't know who's providing
your instructions, but--

319
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:57,425
Follow me, Lady Stark.

320
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:11,141
Cat!
Go on.

321
00:21:11,175 --> 00:21:13,009
Go upstairs.

322
00:21:15,213 --> 00:21:17,914
You little worm!

323
00:21:17,949 --> 00:21:20,717
You take me for some
back-alley Sally

324
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:22,185
you can drag into a--

325
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:25,689
Pssst!

326
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:29,760
I meant no disrespect

327
00:21:29,794 --> 00:21:32,162
to you of all people.

328
00:21:32,196 --> 00:21:34,330
How dare you bring me here!

329
00:21:34,365 --> 00:21:36,165
Have you lost your mind?

330
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,835
No one will come looking for you here.
Isn't that what you wanted?

331
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:42,405
I'm truly sorry
about the locale.

332
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:44,908
How did you know I was
coming to King's Landing?

333
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,011
A dear friend told me.

334
00:21:49,646 --> 00:21:52,481
- Lady Stark.
- Lord Varys.

335
00:21:52,516 --> 00:21:56,518
To see you again after so
many years is a blessing.

336
00:21:56,553 --> 00:21:58,053
Your poor hands.

337
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:02,090
How did you know I was coming?

338
00:22:02,124 --> 00:22:04,592
Knowledge is my trade, My Lady.

339
00:22:06,394 --> 00:22:08,929
Did you bring the dagger
with you, by any chance?

340
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:12,932
My little birds
are everywhere...

341
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:15,201
Even in the north.

342
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:18,771
They whisper to me
the strangest stories.

343
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:26,245
Valyrian steel.

344
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:29,048
Do you know whose dagger
this is?

345
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,485
I must admit I do not.

346
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:36,388
Well well, this is an historic day.

347
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:38,524
Something you don't know

348
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:41,026
<i>that I do.</i>

349
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:46,865
There's only one dagger like this
in all of the Seven Kingdoms.

350
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:50,869
- It's mine.
- Yours?

351
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:55,473
At least it was, until the tournament
on Prince Joffrey's last nameday.

352
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:58,343
I bet on Ser Jaime
in the jousting,

353
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,179
as any sane man would.

354
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,714
When the Knight of the
Glowers unseated him,

355
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:05,318
I lost this dagger.

356
00:23:05,352 --> 00:23:07,520
To whom?

357
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,422
Tyrion Lannister.

358
00:23:09,457 --> 00:23:11,625
The Imp.

359
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:14,461
<i>Grenn, show him what</i>
<i>you farm boys are made of.</i>

360
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:22,802
If that were a real sword, you'd be dead.

361
00:23:22,837 --> 00:23:26,105
Lord Snow here
grew up in a castle

362
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,441
spitting down
on the likes of you.

363
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:30,577
Pyp.

364
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:32,613
Do you think
Ned Stark's bastard

365
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:34,682
bleeds like the rest of us?

366
00:23:41,956 --> 00:23:43,624
Next!

367
00:23:54,237 --> 00:23:55,837
<i>Next!</i>

368
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,151
Well, Lord Snow,

369
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:13,686
<i>it appears you're</i>
<i>the least useless person here.</i>

370
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:16,322
Go clean yourselves up.

371
00:24:16,356 --> 00:24:19,259
<i>There's only so much</i>
<i>I can stomach in a day.</i>

372
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:22,262
A charming man.

373
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:24,397
<i>I don't need him</i>
<i>to be charming.</i>

374
00:24:24,431 --> 00:24:27,100
I need him to turn this bunch
of thieves and runaways

375
00:24:27,135 --> 00:24:28,969
into men of the Night's Watch.

376
00:24:29,003 --> 00:24:31,805
And how's that going,
Commander Mormont?

377
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,208
Slowly.

378
00:24:36,478 --> 00:24:38,112
A raven came

379
00:24:38,147 --> 00:24:40,048
for Ned Stark's son.

380
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,122
Good news or bad?

381
00:24:46,156 --> 00:24:47,857
Both.

382
00:24:49,126 --> 00:24:52,294
<i>Lord Stark.</i>

383
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:55,331
I meant to give you this earlier.

384
00:24:57,467 --> 00:24:59,669
So forgetful these days.

385
00:25:01,504 --> 00:25:04,273
A raven from Winterfell
this morning.

386
00:25:14,983 --> 00:25:17,251
Good news?

387
00:25:20,622 --> 00:25:23,224
Perhaps you'd like to
share it with your wife?

388
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:28,363
- My wife is in Winterfell.
- Is she?

389
00:25:36,372 --> 00:25:38,640
<i>Yes, I'm looking at you.</i>

390
00:25:41,944 --> 00:25:43,945
I thought that she'd
be safest in here.

391
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,881
One of several such
establishments I own.

392
00:25:49,118 --> 00:25:50,586
You're a funny man.

393
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,222
Huh?
A very funny man.

394
00:25:54,491 --> 00:25:55,791
Ned!

395
00:26:03,401 --> 00:26:05,202
Ah, the Starks--

396
00:26:05,237 --> 00:26:08,473
Quick tempers, slow minds.

397
00:26:13,246 --> 00:26:15,948
You broke my nose, bastard!

398
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:25,257
It's an improvement.

399
00:26:28,427 --> 00:26:31,596
If we threw you over the Wall, I wonder
how long it would take you to hit.

400
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,665
I wonder if they'd find you
before the wolves did.

401
00:26:38,371 --> 00:26:40,472
What're you looking at,
Half Man?

402
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:43,041
I'm looking at you.

403
00:26:43,075 --> 00:26:45,343
<i>Yes.</i>

404
00:26:45,378 --> 00:26:48,446
<i>You've got an interesting face.</i>

405
00:26:49,448 --> 00:26:52,651
Hmm, very distinctive faces.

406
00:26:52,685 --> 00:26:54,319
All of you.

407
00:26:54,353 --> 00:26:56,555
And what do you care
about our faces?

408
00:26:56,589 --> 00:26:59,791
It's just I think
they would look marvelous

409
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,461
decorating spikes
in King's Landing.

410
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,630
Perhaps I'll write my sister,
the Queen, about it.

411
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:10,202
We'll talk later, Lord Snow.

412
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:18,476
Everybody knew
what this place was

413
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,479
and no one told me.

414
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,915
No one but you.

415
00:27:22,949 --> 00:27:24,783
My father knew

416
00:27:24,818 --> 00:27:27,086
and he left me to rot
at the Wall all the same.

417
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,754
Grenn's father left him too...

418
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:32,125
Outside a farmhouse
when he was three.

419
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,029
<i>Pyp was caught stealing</i>
<i>a wheel of cheese.</i>

420
00:27:36,063 --> 00:27:39,466
His little sister hadn't
eaten in three days.

421
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,237
He was given a choice:
his right hand or the Wall.

422
00:27:43,271 --> 00:27:45,805
I've been asking the Lord
commander about them.

423
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,024
Fascinating stories.

424
00:27:47,144 --> 00:27:49,347
They hate me because
I'm better than they are.

425
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:50,978
It's a lucky thing
none of them were trained

426
00:27:51,012 --> 00:27:53,547
by a master-at-arms
like your Ser Rodrik.

427
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:56,416
I don't imagine any of them
have ever held a real sword

428
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,552
before they came here.

429
00:28:01,756 --> 00:28:03,723
Oh...

430
00:28:03,758 --> 00:28:06,793
Your brother Bran.

431
00:28:06,828 --> 00:28:09,129
He's woken up.

432
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:12,499
The mere suggestion
that the Queen's brother

433
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:14,834
tried to kill your boy
would be considered treason.

434
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:17,104
We have proof.
We have the blade.

435
00:28:17,138 --> 00:28:19,272
Which Lord Tyrion will say
was stolen from him.

436
00:28:19,307 --> 00:28:21,875
The only man who could say
otherwise has no throat,

437
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,143
thanks to your boy's wolf.

438
00:28:24,178 --> 00:28:27,146
Petyr has promised
to help us find the truth.

439
00:28:28,382 --> 00:28:30,283
He's like a little brother
to me, Ned.

440
00:28:30,318 --> 00:28:32,552
He would never betray my trust.

441
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:35,187
I'll try to keep you
alive, for her sake.

442
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:36,856
A fool's task, admittedly,

443
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,658
<i>but I've never been able</i>
<i>to refuse your wife anything.</i>

444
00:28:39,692 --> 00:28:41,826
I won't forget this.

445
00:28:41,861 --> 00:28:43,928
You're a true friend.

446
00:28:43,963 --> 00:28:47,231
Don't tell anyone.
I have a reputation to maintain.

447
00:28:51,403 --> 00:28:53,905
- How could you be so stupid?
- Calm down.

448
00:28:53,939 --> 00:28:55,773
He's a child--
10 years old.

449
00:28:55,807 --> 00:28:58,209
- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking of us.

450
00:28:58,243 --> 00:29:00,845
You're a bit late to start
complaining about it now.

451
00:29:00,879 --> 00:29:02,747
- What has the boy told them?
- Nothing.

452
00:29:02,781 --> 00:29:04,749
He's said nothing.
He remembers nothing.

453
00:29:04,783 --> 00:29:06,918
Then what are you raving about?

454
00:29:06,952 --> 00:29:08,586
What if it comes back to him?

455
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,422
If he tells his father
what he saw--

456
00:29:10,456 --> 00:29:12,891
We'll say he was lying.
We'll say he was dreaming.

457
00:29:12,926 --> 00:29:14,460
We'll say whatever we like.

458
00:29:14,494 --> 00:29:16,762
I think we can outfox
a 10-year-old.

459
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:20,032
- And my husband?
- I'll go to war with him if I have to.

460
00:29:20,067 --> 00:29:22,836
They can write
a ballad about us:

461
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,171
"The War for Cersei's Cunt."

462
00:29:30,077 --> 00:29:32,079
- Let me go.
- Never.

463
00:29:32,113 --> 00:29:34,747
- Let me go.
- The boy

464
00:29:34,782 --> 00:29:37,049
won't talk.

465
00:29:37,084 --> 00:29:39,085
And if he does, I'll kill him.

466
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,555
Him, Ned Stark, the King--
the whole bloody lot of them,

467
00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:45,424
until you and I are
the only people

468
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:47,659
left in this world.

469
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,104
I wish I could see the girls.

470
00:30:00,139 --> 00:30:03,374
- It's too dangerous.
- Just for a moment.

471
00:30:03,408 --> 00:30:05,676
Until we know
who our enemies are--

472
00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:07,912
I know they did it, Ned.
The Lannisters.

473
00:30:07,946 --> 00:30:09,947
In my bones, I know it.

474
00:30:09,981 --> 00:30:11,982
Littlefinger's right.

475
00:30:13,585 --> 00:30:15,887
I can't do anything
without proof.

476
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:18,456
And if you find the proof?

477
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,691
Then I bring it to Robert...

478
00:30:20,726 --> 00:30:23,495
And hope he's still
the man I once knew.

479
00:30:25,264 --> 00:30:27,265
You watch yourself
on the road, huh?

480
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,736
That temper of yours
is a dangerous thing.

481
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,606
My temper?
Gods be good,

482
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:36,409
you nearly killed poor
Littlefinger yesterday.

483
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:42,916
He still loves you.

484
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,986
Does he?

485
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,204
Off with you.

486
00:31:37,001 --> 00:31:40,470
Yes, it's been a long time.

487
00:31:40,505 --> 00:31:44,240
But I still remember
every face.

488
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:47,943
You remember your first?

489
00:31:50,347 --> 00:31:52,515
Of course, Your Grace.

490
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:54,584
Who was it?

491
00:31:54,618 --> 00:31:56,753
A Tyroshi.

492
00:31:56,787 --> 00:31:59,055
- Never learned the name.
- Hmm.

493
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:01,391
How'd you do it?

494
00:32:01,426 --> 00:32:03,493
Lance through the heart.

495
00:32:03,528 --> 00:32:05,363
<i>Quick one.</i>

496
00:32:06,732 --> 00:32:09,100
Lucky for you.

497
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:13,005
Mine was some Tarly boy
at the Battle of Summerhall.

498
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:17,008
<i>My horse took an arrow</i>
<i>so I was on foot,</i>

499
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:19,044
<i>slogging through the mud.</i>

500
00:32:20,346 --> 00:32:25,684
He came running at me,
this dumb high-born lad,

501
00:32:25,718 --> 00:32:27,887
thinking he could end
the rebellion

502
00:32:27,921 --> 00:32:30,455
<i>with single swing of his sword.</i>

503
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:33,792
<i>I knocked him down</i>
<i>with the hammer.</i>

504
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:36,195
<i>Gods, I was strong then.</i>

505
00:32:36,229 --> 00:32:39,065
Caved in his breastplate.

506
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:42,268
Probably shattered
every rib he had.

507
00:32:42,303 --> 00:32:46,140
<i>Stood over him,</i>
<i>hammer in the air.</i>

508
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:50,511
Right before I brought it down
he shouted, "Wait!

509
00:32:50,546 --> 00:32:53,581
Wait."

510
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,622
They never tell you
how they all shit themselves.

511
00:33:01,656 --> 00:33:06,192
They don't put that part
in the songs.

512
00:33:08,728 --> 00:33:11,230
Stupid boy.

513
00:33:12,332 --> 00:33:14,934
<i>Now the Tarlys bend the knee</i>

514
00:33:14,968 --> 00:33:17,370
<i>like everyone else.</i>

515
00:33:17,404 --> 00:33:19,539
He could have lingered

516
00:33:19,573 --> 00:33:22,242
on the edge of the battle
with the smart boys

517
00:33:22,276 --> 00:33:25,879
and today his wife would
be making him miserable,

518
00:33:25,914 --> 00:33:28,883
<i>his sons would be ingrates,</i>

519
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:31,953
and he'd be waking
three times in the night

520
00:33:31,987 --> 00:33:34,889
to piss into a bowl.
Wine!

521
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:42,496
Lancel.
Gods, what a stupid name.

522
00:33:43,464 --> 00:33:47,067
Lancel Lannister.

523
00:33:47,101 --> 00:33:51,271
Who named you?
Some halfwit with a stutter?

524
00:33:53,674 --> 00:33:56,510
What are you doing?

525
00:33:57,912 --> 00:34:00,447
- It's empty, Your Grace.
- What do you mean it's empty?

526
00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:03,316
- There's no more wine.
- Is that what empty means?

527
00:34:05,386 --> 00:34:07,754
So get more.

528
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:13,659
Tell your cousin
to get in here.

529
00:34:13,693 --> 00:34:15,094
Kingslayer!

530
00:34:15,128 --> 00:34:17,163
Get in here.

531
00:34:24,603 --> 00:34:27,805
<i>Surrounded by Lannisters.</i>

532
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,076
Every time I close my eyes
I see their blond hair

533
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:35,379
and their smug,
satisfied faces.

534
00:34:35,413 --> 00:34:38,181
It must wound your pride, huh?

535
00:34:38,216 --> 00:34:41,184
Standing out there
like a glorified sentry.

536
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:46,490
Jaime Lannister,
son of the mighty Tywin...

537
00:34:47,759 --> 00:34:50,195
Forced to mind the door
while your King

538
00:34:50,229 --> 00:34:53,198
eats and drinks
and shits and fucks.

539
00:34:55,101 --> 00:34:56,701
So come on.

540
00:34:56,736 --> 00:34:58,836
We're telling war stories.

541
00:35:00,072 --> 00:35:03,708
Who was your first kill,
not counting old men?

542
00:35:04,943 --> 00:35:07,578
One of the outlaws
in the Brotherhood.

543
00:35:07,613 --> 00:35:10,181
I was there that day.

544
00:35:10,215 --> 00:35:13,384
You were only a squire,
16 years old.

545
00:35:13,418 --> 00:35:16,320
You killed Simon Toyne
with a counter riposte.

546
00:35:16,354 --> 00:35:18,622
Best move I ever saw.

547
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:22,893
A good fighter, Toyne,
but he lacked stamina.

548
00:35:22,927 --> 00:35:25,062
<i>Your outlaw...</i>

549
00:35:25,097 --> 00:35:27,665
Any last words?

550
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:30,534
- I cut his head off, so no.
- Hmmm.

551
00:35:30,569 --> 00:35:33,505
What about Aerys Targaryen?

552
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:37,475
What did the Mad King say when
you stabbed him in the back?

553
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,578
I never asked.

554
00:35:39,612 --> 00:35:42,648
Did he call you a traitor?

555
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,852
Did he plead for a reprieve?

556
00:35:47,321 --> 00:35:50,356
He said the same thing
he'd been saying for hours...

557
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:54,226
"Burn them all."

558
00:35:58,998 --> 00:36:00,932
If that's all, Your Grace...

559
00:36:33,196 --> 00:36:35,631
Do the Dothraki buy
their slaves?

560
00:36:35,665 --> 00:36:37,800
The Dothraki don't
believe in money.

561
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:40,135
Most of their slaves were
given to them as gifts.

562
00:36:40,169 --> 00:36:42,404
- From whom?
- If you rule a city

563
00:36:42,438 --> 00:36:45,373
and you see the horde approaching,
you have two choices:

564
00:36:45,407 --> 00:36:47,241
Pay tribute or fight.

565
00:36:47,276 --> 00:36:48,976
An easy choice for most.

566
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:52,513
Of course, sometimes
it's not enough.

567
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:55,983
Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by
the number of slaves he's given.

568
00:36:56,018 --> 00:36:58,586
<i>He might think the men too weak</i>
<i>or the women too ugly.</i>

569
00:36:58,621 --> 00:37:02,157
Sometimes a Khal decides his riders
haven't had a good fight in months

570
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:05,494
- <i>and need the practice.</i>
- <i>Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.</i>

571
00:37:07,865 --> 00:37:10,633
Tell them all to stop.

572
00:37:10,668 --> 00:37:12,802
You want the entire
horde to stop?

573
00:37:12,836 --> 00:37:15,171
For how long?

574
00:37:15,205 --> 00:37:18,240
Until I command them otherwise.

575
00:37:18,274 --> 00:37:20,642
You're learning
to talk like a Queen.

576
00:37:20,677 --> 00:37:22,744
Not a Queen.

577
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:24,680
A Khaleesi.

578
00:37:34,924 --> 00:37:37,460
Annakhas dozgosores.

579
00:38:01,553 --> 00:38:03,654
You dare!

580
00:38:03,689 --> 00:38:07,159
You give commands to me?
To <i>me?</i>

581
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:12,698
You do not command the dragon.
I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

582
00:38:12,732 --> 00:38:15,101
I don't take orders
from savages

583
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:17,636
or their sluts.
Do you hear me?

584
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,842
<i>Hash shafka zali nharees,</i>
<i>zhey Khaleesi?</i>

585
00:38:22,877 --> 00:38:25,679
Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.

586
00:38:25,713 --> 00:38:27,181
No.

587
00:38:27,215 --> 00:38:29,216
<i>Ishish chare acharoe</i>
<i>hash me nem éjervae</i>

588
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:32,319
- <i>nharesoon.</i>
- Rakharo say you should take ear,

589
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:36,023
- to teach respect.
- Please please, don't hurt him.

590
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:43,763
Tell him I don't want
my brother harmed.

591
00:38:43,797 --> 00:38:46,665
<i>Khaleesi vos zalo</i>
<i>meme nem azisa.</i>

592
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,101
Huh?

593
00:38:50,169 --> 00:38:52,837
<i>Shafki.</i>

594
00:38:56,576 --> 00:39:00,280
Mormont!
Kill these Dothraki dogs!

595
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,388
I am your King!

596
00:39:09,425 --> 00:39:12,494
Shall we return
to the Khalasar, khaleesi?

597
00:39:32,313 --> 00:39:34,647
Uh uh uh uh uh.

598
00:39:34,681 --> 00:39:37,784
You walk.

599
00:42:07,978 --> 00:42:12,447
I wanted to be here when you
saw it for the first time.

600
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:23,892
- I'm leaving this morning.
- You're leaving?

601
00:42:24,961 --> 00:42:27,195
I'm the First Ranger.

602
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:29,498
My job is out there.

603
00:42:29,532 --> 00:42:32,868
- There have been disturbing reports.
- What kind of reports?

604
00:42:32,902 --> 00:42:34,803
The kind I don't
want to believe.

605
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:38,941
I'm ready.
I won't let you down.

606
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,510
You're not going.

607
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,748
You're no ranger, Jon.

608
00:42:45,782 --> 00:42:48,517
- But I'm better than every--
- Better than no one!

609
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,557
Here...

610
00:42:55,591 --> 00:42:57,926
A man gets what he earns,

611
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,128
when he earns it.

612
00:43:04,067 --> 00:43:06,301
We'll speak when I return.

613
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,953
- A bear's balls.
- Oh, you're joking?

614
00:43:24,987 --> 00:43:28,524
And his brains and his guts,
his lungs and his heart

615
00:43:28,558 --> 00:43:31,060
all fried in his own fat.

616
00:43:31,094 --> 00:43:33,696
When you're a hundred miles
north of the Wall

617
00:43:33,731 --> 00:43:37,232
and you ate your last meal a week ago,
you leave nothing for the wolves.

618
00:43:37,267 --> 00:43:40,536
And how do
a bear's balls taste?

619
00:43:40,571 --> 00:43:42,872
A bit chewy.

620
00:43:44,975 --> 00:43:48,511
And what about you, My Lord?
What's the strangest thing you've eaten?

621
00:43:48,545 --> 00:43:50,913
Do Dornish girls count?

622
00:43:54,884 --> 00:43:58,019
So you roam the Seven Kingdoms,

623
00:43:58,053 --> 00:44:00,254
collaring pickpockets
and horse thieves

624
00:44:00,288 --> 00:44:02,389
and bringing them here
as eager recruits?

625
00:44:02,424 --> 00:44:04,224
Aye.

626
00:44:04,259 --> 00:44:07,260
But it's not all of 'em's
done bad things.

627
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:10,296
Some of 'em's just poor lads
looking for steady feed.

628
00:44:10,331 --> 00:44:13,032
Some of 'em's high-born lads
looking for glory.

629
00:44:13,066 --> 00:44:16,602
They have a better chance finding feed
than glory.

630
00:44:16,636 --> 00:44:20,172
The Night's Watch is
a joke to you, is it?

631
00:44:20,206 --> 00:44:22,742
Is that what we are, Lannister?

632
00:44:22,776 --> 00:44:25,611
An army of jesters in black?

633
00:44:25,645 --> 00:44:27,780
You don't have enough men
to be an army

634
00:44:27,814 --> 00:44:31,450
and aside from Yoren here, none
of you are particularly funny.

635
00:44:31,485 --> 00:44:34,220
<i>I hope we've provided you</i>
<i>with some good stories to tell</i>

636
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:36,189
<i>when you're back</i>
<i>in King's Landing.</i>

637
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:37,758
But something to think about

638
00:44:37,792 --> 00:44:39,893
while you're drinking
your wine down there,

639
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:41,862
enjoying your brothels--

640
00:44:41,897 --> 00:44:46,234
Half the boys you've seen training
will die north of the Wall.

641
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:49,738
<i>Might be a wilding's axe</i>
<i>that gets them,</i>

642
00:44:49,772 --> 00:44:52,440
<i>might be sickness,</i>

643
00:44:52,475 --> 00:44:55,309
might just be the cold.

644
00:44:55,344 --> 00:44:58,045
They die in pain.

645
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,615
And they do it so plump
little lords like you

646
00:45:01,649 --> 00:45:05,118
can enjoy their summer
afternoons in peace and comfort.

647
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,121
Do you think I'm plump?

648
00:45:12,859 --> 00:45:15,260
Listen, Benjen--
May I call you Benjen?

649
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,481
<i>Call me what you like.</i>

650
00:45:16,601 --> 00:45:18,912
<i>I'm not sure what I've</i>
<i>done to offend you.</i>

651
00:45:19,032 --> 00:45:21,200
I have great admiration
for the Night's Watch.

652
00:45:21,234 --> 00:45:23,803
I've great admiration
for you as First Ranger.

653
00:45:23,837 --> 00:45:25,871
You know, my brother
once told me

654
00:45:25,906 --> 00:45:28,508
that nothing someone says
before the word "but"

655
00:45:28,542 --> 00:45:30,442
really counts.

656
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,979
But...

657
00:45:33,013 --> 00:45:36,248
I don't believe that giants
and ghouls and White Walkers

658
00:45:36,282 --> 00:45:38,083
are lurking beyond the Wall.

659
00:45:38,117 --> 00:45:40,485
I believe that
the only difference

660
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,787
between us and
the wildlings is that

661
00:45:42,821 --> 00:45:45,156
when the Wall went up,
our ancestors happened

662
00:45:45,191 --> 00:45:47,424
to live on
the right side of it.

663
00:45:47,459 --> 00:45:49,359
You're right.

664
00:45:50,962 --> 00:45:53,063
The wildlings are
no different from us.

665
00:45:53,097 --> 00:45:55,966
A little rougher maybe.

666
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,769
But they're made
of meat and bone.

667
00:45:58,804 --> 00:46:01,406
I know how to track them
and I know how to kill them.

668
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,377
It's not the wildlings
giving me sleepless nights.

669
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,681
You've never been
north of the Wall,

670
00:46:08,715 --> 00:46:11,117
so don't tell me
what's out there.

671
00:46:14,622 --> 00:46:16,656
Are you going below?

672
00:46:18,158 --> 00:46:21,527
- Keep well, keep warm.
- Enjoy the capital, brother.

673
00:46:21,562 --> 00:46:24,063
Oh, I always do.

674
00:46:32,406 --> 00:46:34,674
I think he's starting
to like me.

675
00:46:37,412 --> 00:46:40,881
- "Going below"?
- Aye.

676
00:46:40,916 --> 00:46:42,550
Into the tunnel

677
00:46:42,584 --> 00:46:44,720
and out the other side.

678
00:46:44,754 --> 00:46:47,490
He'll be north of the Wall
for a month or two.

679
00:46:49,626 --> 00:46:52,795
So you're heading down
to King's Landing too.

680
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:55,398
Aye, day after tomorrow.

681
00:46:55,433 --> 00:46:59,236
I get about half of my
recruits from their dungeons.

682
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:03,540
Let's share the road.
I could use some decent company.

683
00:47:03,575 --> 00:47:08,613
I... I travel a bit
on the grubby side, My Lord.

684
00:47:08,647 --> 00:47:12,651
Not this time. We'll be staying at
the finest castles and inns.

685
00:47:12,685 --> 00:47:15,420
No one turns away a Lannister.

686
00:47:20,926 --> 00:47:23,193
At Jakar?

687
00:47:23,228 --> 00:47:25,028
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

688
00:47:25,062 --> 00:47:27,297
Ath ja haker.

689
00:47:27,331 --> 00:47:29,265
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

690
00:47:29,299 --> 00:47:31,167
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

691
00:47:31,201 --> 00:47:32,968
Yes, Khaleesi.

692
00:47:34,738 --> 00:47:36,972
Oh, what are you doing?

693
00:47:37,007 --> 00:47:39,608
When was last time
you bleed, Khaleesi?

694
00:47:42,045 --> 00:47:44,079
You change, Khaleesi.

695
00:47:53,124 --> 00:47:55,993
For a man on horseback,
the curved blade

696
00:47:56,027 --> 00:47:58,529
is a good thing,
easier to handle.

697
00:47:58,563 --> 00:48:02,033
It's a good weapon
for a Dothrakan.

698
00:48:02,067 --> 00:48:04,836
But a man in full plate--

699
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:06,671
<i>Shori tawakof</i>

700
00:48:06,706 --> 00:48:09,674
the <i>arakh</i> won't get
through the steel.

701
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:13,011
That's where the broadsword
has the advantage.

702
00:48:13,046 --> 00:48:16,048
Designed for piercing plate.

703
00:48:20,219 --> 00:48:23,454
- Armor.
- Armor.

704
00:48:23,488 --> 00:48:26,123
Armor make a man...

705
00:48:26,157 --> 00:48:28,291
- <i>Vroz?</i>
- Slow.

706
00:48:28,325 --> 00:48:30,259
- Slow.
- It's true,

707
00:48:30,294 --> 00:48:33,595
but it also keeps a man alive.

708
00:48:51,516 --> 00:48:54,017
He still is.

709
00:48:54,052 --> 00:48:56,520
A man of great honor

710
00:48:56,554 --> 00:48:58,522
and I betrayed him.

711
00:49:22,147 --> 00:49:24,615
I don't think
she wants to eat dog.

712
00:49:27,886 --> 00:49:30,654
The Khaleesi
have baby inside her.

713
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:35,360
<i>It is true.</i>
<i>She does not bleed for two moons.</i>

714
00:49:35,394 --> 00:49:37,929
<i>Her belly start to swell.</i>

715
00:49:39,866 --> 00:49:43,769
<i>She does not want to eat horse.</i>

716
00:49:45,172 --> 00:49:48,075
I'll have the boys
butcher a goat for supper.

717
00:49:53,248 --> 00:49:55,916
I need to ride to Qohor.

718
00:49:58,853 --> 00:50:02,856
Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak.

719
00:50:02,891 --> 00:50:05,225
Don't worry.
I'll catch you.

720
00:50:05,259 --> 00:50:07,694
The horde's easy to find.

721
00:50:18,172 --> 00:50:20,073
Don't stand so still.

722
00:50:20,107 --> 00:50:23,643
It's harder to hit
a moving target.

723
00:50:27,815 --> 00:50:30,650
Except for you.
You move too much.

724
00:50:30,684 --> 00:50:33,386
I could just hold my sword out
and let you do the work for me.

725
00:50:38,558 --> 00:50:41,526
<i>How many winters have</i>
<i>you seen, Lord Tyrion?</i>

726
00:50:41,561 --> 00:50:44,195
Eight-- no, nine.

727
00:50:44,229 --> 00:50:46,764
All of them brief?

728
00:50:46,798 --> 00:50:50,033
They say the winter of my birth was
three years long, Maester Aemon.

729
00:50:50,068 --> 00:50:53,103
This summer has lasted nine.

730
00:50:53,137 --> 00:50:57,473
But reports from the Citadel
tell us the days grow shorter.

731
00:50:57,507 --> 00:50:59,942
The Starks are always
right eventually:

732
00:50:59,976 --> 00:51:02,945
Winter is coming.

733
00:51:02,979 --> 00:51:05,780
This one will be long

734
00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:08,516
and dark things
will come with it.

735
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:11,619
We've been capturing wildlings,

736
00:51:11,653 --> 00:51:14,688
more every month.
They're fleeing south.

737
00:51:14,723 --> 00:51:18,960
<i>The ones who flee say they've seen</i>
<i>the White Walkers.</i>

738
00:51:18,994 --> 00:51:22,398
Yes, and the fishermen of
Lannisport say they see mermaids.

739
00:51:22,432 --> 00:51:25,835
One of our own rangers swore he
saw them kill his companions.

740
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:27,937
He swore it right up
to the moment

741
00:51:27,972 --> 00:51:29,873
Ned Stark chopped his head off.

742
00:51:29,907 --> 00:51:32,543
<i>The Night's Watch</i>
<i>is the only thing</i>

743
00:51:32,577 --> 00:51:34,611
standing between the realm

744
00:51:34,646 --> 00:51:36,913
and what lies beyond.

745
00:51:36,948 --> 00:51:39,149
<i>And it has has become an army</i>

746
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:42,785
of undisciplined boys
and tired old men.

747
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,354
There are less than
a thousand of us now.

748
00:51:46,389 --> 00:51:49,224
We can't man the other
castles on the Wall.

749
00:51:49,258 --> 00:51:52,360
<i>We can't properly</i>
<i>patrol the wilderness.</i>

750
00:51:52,394 --> 00:51:56,063
We've barely enough resources
to keep our lads armed

751
00:51:56,098 --> 00:51:58,733
- and fed.
- Your sister

752
00:51:58,767 --> 00:52:01,569
sits by the side the King.

753
00:52:01,604 --> 00:52:04,472
Tell her we need help.

754
00:52:04,507 --> 00:52:06,842
<i>When winter does come,</i>

755
00:52:06,876 --> 00:52:10,312
gods help us all
if we're not ready.

756
00:53:17,049 --> 00:53:19,484
I'm sorry to see
you leave, Lannister.

757
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:23,155
It's either me or this cold.

758
00:53:23,189 --> 00:53:25,557
And <i>it</i> doesn't appear
to be going anywhere.

759
00:53:25,591 --> 00:53:28,560
Will you stop at Winterfell
on your way South?

760
00:53:28,595 --> 00:53:29,828
I expect I will.

761
00:53:29,862 --> 00:53:31,897
Gods know there aren't
many feather beds

762
00:53:31,931 --> 00:53:34,065
between here
and King's Landing.

763
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,234
If you see my brother Bran,

764
00:53:36,269 --> 00:53:38,804
tell him I miss him.

765
00:53:38,838 --> 00:53:40,872
Tell him I'd visit if I could.

766
00:53:40,906 --> 00:53:42,474
Of course.

767
00:53:42,508 --> 00:53:45,077
He'll never walk again.

768
00:53:45,111 --> 00:53:46,778
If you're going to be
a cripple,

769
00:53:46,812 --> 00:53:49,047
it's better to be a rich cripple.

770
00:53:49,082 --> 00:53:51,550
You take care, Snow.

771
00:53:51,584 --> 00:53:53,585
Farewell, My Lord.

772
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:07,899
You are late, boy.

773
00:54:09,768 --> 00:54:12,269
<i>Tomorrow you will</i>
<i>be here at midday.</i>

774
00:54:12,303 --> 00:54:14,537
Who are you?

775
00:54:14,572 --> 00:54:17,040
Your dancing master,

776
00:54:17,074 --> 00:54:18,642
<i>Syrio Forel.</i>

777
00:54:22,747 --> 00:54:24,247
Tomorrow you will catch it.

778
00:54:24,282 --> 00:54:26,283
Now pick it up.

779
00:54:28,586 --> 00:54:30,888
That is not the way, boy.

780
00:54:30,922 --> 00:54:35,093
This is not a greatsword that is
needing two hands to swing it.

781
00:54:35,127 --> 00:54:39,264
- It's too heavy.
- It is heavy as it needs to be

782
00:54:39,299 --> 00:54:41,167
to make you strong.

783
00:54:42,069 --> 00:54:43,603
Just so.

784
00:54:43,637 --> 00:54:46,072
One hand is all that is needed.

785
00:54:47,308 --> 00:54:49,443
Now you are standing all wrong.

786
00:54:49,477 --> 00:54:51,846
Turn your body sideface.

787
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,315
Yes.

788
00:54:54,349 --> 00:54:56,518
So.

789
00:54:56,552 --> 00:54:58,886
You are skinny.
That is good.

790
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:01,923
The target is smaller.

791
00:55:01,957 --> 00:55:04,025
Now the grip--
Let me see.

792
00:55:04,059 --> 00:55:06,827
Yes.

793
00:55:06,862 --> 00:55:09,697
The grip must be delicate.

794
00:55:10,665 --> 00:55:12,566
What if I drop it?

795
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:14,935
The steel must be
part of your arm.

796
00:55:14,969 --> 00:55:17,705
Can you drop
part of your arm? No.

797
00:55:17,739 --> 00:55:21,975
Nine years Syrio Forel was first
sword to the Sealord of Braavos.

798
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:24,778
He knows these things.
You must listen to me, boy.

799
00:55:24,812 --> 00:55:26,580
I'm a girl.

800
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:30,184
Boy, girl--
you are a sword,

801
00:55:30,218 --> 00:55:33,120
that is all.

802
00:55:33,154 --> 00:55:35,556
That is the grip.

803
00:55:35,591 --> 00:55:37,759
You are not holding
a battle-axe.

804
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:40,128
- You are holding--
- A needle.

805
00:55:40,163 --> 00:55:41,163
Ahhh.

806
00:55:42,832 --> 00:55:45,434
Just so.

807
00:55:45,469 --> 00:55:48,304
Now we will begin the dance.

808
00:55:48,339 --> 00:55:49,806
Remember, child,

809
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,809
this is not the dance of the
Westeros we are learning--

810
00:55:52,843 --> 00:55:54,978
The knight's dance,

811
00:55:55,012 --> 00:55:57,413
hacking and hammering.

812
00:55:57,448 --> 00:56:00,583
This is the Bravo's dance...

813
00:56:02,086 --> 00:56:04,053
The water dance.

814
00:56:04,087 --> 00:56:06,322
It is swift

815
00:56:06,356 --> 00:56:08,624
and sudden.

816
00:56:10,093 --> 00:56:12,394
All men are made of water,

817
00:56:12,429 --> 00:56:14,163
do you know this?

818
00:56:14,197 --> 00:56:16,499
If you pierce them,

819
00:56:16,533 --> 00:56:20,302
the water leaks out
and they die.

820
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:24,806
Now you will try to strike me.

821
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:29,643
Ha!

822
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:42,857
Up!

823
00:56:46,228 --> 00:56:47,328
Ha!

824
00:56:58,573 --> 00:56:59,940
Ah.

825
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,944
Dead.

826
00:57:03,978 --> 00:57:05,078
Oh!

827
00:57:05,113 --> 00:57:06,713
Dead.

828
00:57:06,748 --> 00:57:08,782
<i>Hup!</i>

829
00:57:11,352 --> 00:57:13,353
Very dead.

830
00:57:13,387 --> 00:57:15,922
Come.

831
00:57:15,956 --> 00:57:17,824
Ah ah ah!

832
00:57:17,858 --> 00:57:20,827
<i>Hup!</i>

833
00:57:20,861 --> 00:57:22,862
Again, faster.

834
00:57:27,901 --> 00:57:29,802
Ah.
