01:27:21,885 --> 01:27:24,677
because it's been invaded by
undead soldiers.

541
01:27:25,594 --> 01:27:26,843
(SNARLS)

542
01:27:26,927 --> 01:27:28,135
WEISS: Before that point,

543
01:27:28,219 --> 01:27:30,344
there's sort of an agoraphobia
to the whole thing

544
01:27:30,427 --> 01:27:33,093
where you have
this giant wide-open space

545
01:27:33,177 --> 01:27:36,927
and everywhere you look
you... there's something

546
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:38,385
that could be coming
to kill you.

547
01:27:38,469 --> 01:27:40,802
Once you get inside Winterfell,
everything contracts,

548
01:27:40,885 --> 01:27:44,260
and the... the walls literally
start to close in around you,

549
01:27:44,344 --> 01:27:46,177
and something is there
in the dark with you,

550
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:48,177
but you don't know exactly
where it is.

551
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:50,010
And we thought that
the pace change

552
01:27:50,093 --> 01:27:51,968
and the tonal change
was really important

553
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:54,927
to have that in this episode,

554
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:57,093
otherwise the episode
would start to feel...

555
01:27:57,427 --> 01:27:59,260
would start to feel monotonous.

556
01:28:02,469 --> 01:28:03,719
Dracarys.

557
01:28:03,927 --> 01:28:05,236
WEISS: We thought it was
important that,

558
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:08,302
whatever the plan was,
that it not just work out,

559
01:28:08,385 --> 01:28:10,177
'cause that would be
kind of dull.

560
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:12,552
While there's no reason to know
for certain that

561
01:28:12,636 --> 01:28:15,802
the fire wouldn't kill
or destroy the Night King,

562
01:28:15,885 --> 01:28:18,719
there's also no particular
reason to believe that it would.

563
01:28:18,927 --> 01:28:21,260
And then, a few moments after
this happens,

564
01:28:21,427 --> 01:28:23,385
the Night King brings them
a whole new,

565
01:28:23,469 --> 01:28:27,052
larger undead problem
by taking all of their own

566
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:29,885
who have been killed
in the course of this battle,

567
01:28:29,968 --> 01:28:31,594
and turning them into the enemy.

568
01:28:36,927 --> 01:28:39,219
BENIOFF: I mean, we talked about
various endings for Jorah

569
01:28:39,302 --> 01:28:41,469
for a long time, but, you know,
you think about Jorah,

570
01:28:41,552 --> 01:28:44,135
from the very first time
we met him, he was with Daeny,

571
01:28:44,219 --> 01:28:46,968
and from that time,
he's been mostly by her side.

572
01:28:47,052 --> 01:28:48,385
Part of Jorah's tragedy is

573
01:28:48,469 --> 01:28:51,093
that he was in love with a woman
who couldn't love him back,

574
01:28:51,177 --> 01:28:53,177
but he's accepted that
for quite a long time,

575
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:55,260
at the same time he was
going to fight for her

576
01:28:55,344 --> 01:28:57,552
as long as he could
and as well as he could.

577
01:28:57,636 --> 01:29:01,427
There'd never been a moment
where she more needed someone

578
01:29:01,511 --> 01:29:03,552
to fight to protect her
than this moment.

579
01:29:03,636 --> 01:29:06,552
And if he could've chosen
a way to die,

580
01:29:06,636 --> 01:29:08,552
this is how he would've chosen
to die.

581
01:29:08,636 --> 01:29:13,552
So, it was something we thought
would be powerful to give him.

582
01:29:14,093 --> 01:29:17,677
- (DAENERYS SOBS)
- (DRAGON EXHALES)

583
01:29:20,594 --> 01:29:22,195
BENIOFF: The reason
the Godswood was chosen

584
01:29:22,219 --> 01:29:23,885
is because it's such
a source of power

585
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:27,469
for those who believe in the old
gods, and for Bran in particular,

586
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:29,761
so we know the weirwood tree
and the three-eyed raven

587
01:29:29,843 --> 01:29:31,260
have a very deep connection.

588
01:29:31,344 --> 01:29:33,761
That was always the location
where Bran was going

589
01:29:33,843 --> 01:29:35,594
to be waiting
for the Night King.

590
01:29:35,927 --> 01:29:37,177
I just want you to know...

591
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:41,010
- the things I did...
- Everything you did

592
01:29:41,093 --> 01:29:42,552
brought you where you are now.

593
01:29:44,677 --> 01:29:45,719
Where you belong.

594
01:29:48,344 --> 01:29:49,344
Home.

595
01:29:49,511 --> 01:29:51,552
WEISS: It's not like the show
is entirely about

596
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:54,636
people redeeming themselves
and then it's all over,

597
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:56,802
but if you... if the canvas
is big enough,

598
01:29:56,885 --> 01:30:00,302
there are spaces for those
redemptive moments.

599
01:30:00,385 --> 01:30:02,302
I think what was
really important for Theon

600
01:30:02,385 --> 01:30:04,677
at the end was hearing
that thank you from Bran,

601
01:30:04,761 --> 01:30:06,469
because Bran knows
what's gonna happen.

602
01:30:06,552 --> 01:30:07,552
BRAN: Theon.

603
01:30:12,135 --> 01:30:13,511
You're a good man.

604
01:30:14,469 --> 01:30:15,469
Thank you.

605
01:30:15,719 --> 01:30:17,570
He knows he's dead,
he knows he's not gonna be able

606
01:30:17,594 --> 01:30:20,260
to kill the Night King,
but I think what's really heroic

607
01:30:20,344 --> 01:30:22,302
about his action is that
we're all gonna die,

608
01:30:22,385 --> 01:30:24,361
and we know we're not gonna be
able to defeat death at the end,

609
01:30:24,385 --> 01:30:26,885
but, you know, it's... it's how
you face those final moments,

610
01:30:26,968 --> 01:30:28,636
and he chooses to run
straight at it,

611
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:32,302
and I think he dies in a way
that, um, makes us

612
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:35,594
really proud of him and
the journey he's gone through.

613
01:30:40,093 --> 01:30:42,511
- (ARYA SCREAMS)
- BENIOFF: For...

614
01:30:42,594 --> 01:30:44,612
God, I think it's probably
three years now or something,

615
01:30:44,636 --> 01:30:47,010
we've known that it was
gonna be Arya

616
01:30:47,093 --> 01:30:49,177
who delivers that...
that fatal blow.

617
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:50,900
WEISS: She seemed like
the best candidate,

618
01:30:50,927 --> 01:30:53,761
provided we weren't thinking
about her in that moment.

619
01:30:53,843 --> 01:30:55,570
One of the great things
about having this many people

620
01:30:55,594 --> 01:30:58,177
you care about
in a sequence together

621
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:00,219
is that it can kind of
pull people's attention

622
01:31:00,302 --> 01:31:02,511
and focus to people that
they care about a lot,

623
01:31:02,594 --> 01:31:05,511
like Jon, like Daeny,
Theon, and Bran,

624
01:31:05,594 --> 01:31:07,552
not to mention Tyrion
and Sansa in the crypt,

625
01:31:07,636 --> 01:31:08,819
so you're going
all over the place

626
01:31:08,843 --> 01:31:10,683
with people who you're
desperately worried for,

627
01:31:10,761 --> 01:31:14,344
and, uh, hopefully
you forget about the fact that

628
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:16,511
Arya Stark ran out of
that castle

629
01:31:16,594 --> 01:31:17,802
with the battle drums playing,

630
01:31:17,885 --> 01:31:19,594
going towards some purpose,

631
01:31:19,677 --> 01:31:21,636
and we don't know what
until it happens.

632
01:31:21,719 --> 01:31:23,599
BENIOFF: We hoped to kind of
avoid the expected,

633
01:31:23,636 --> 01:31:25,385
and Jon Snow has
always been the hero,

634
01:31:25,469 --> 01:31:26,885
the one who's been the savior,

635
01:31:26,968 --> 01:31:30,219
but it just didn't seem right
to us, for this...

636
01:31:30,302 --> 01:31:31,302
for this moment.

637
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:34,278
We knew it had to be Valyrian
steel, to the exact spot where

638
01:31:34,302 --> 01:31:38,219
the child of the forest put the dragonglass
blade to create the Night King,

639
01:31:38,302 --> 01:31:41,885
and he is uncreated
by the Valyrian steel.

640
01:31:41,968 --> 01:31:43,552
At the end of it, it's still...

641
01:31:43,636 --> 01:31:46,636
It's a victory for the living,
but at great cost,

642
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:49,843
because some of our favorite
characters fall along the way.

643
01:31:51,135 --> 01:31:52,445
WEISS: We knew from
the beginning,

644
01:31:52,469 --> 01:31:55,552
once we'd handed the outline in,
what we were in for.

645
01:31:55,636 --> 01:31:59,010
The director, Miguel Sapochnik,
took what we were doing

646
01:31:59,093 --> 01:32:01,010
and defined this episode.

647
01:32:01,093 --> 01:32:03,385
Miguel did
a tremendous amount of

648
01:32:03,469 --> 01:32:05,427
heroic heavy lifting
on this front.

649
01:32:05,511 --> 01:32:07,427
He knew that if the planning
wasn't there,

650
01:32:07,511 --> 01:32:10,927
we never would've ended up
with the consistent excellence

651
01:32:11,010 --> 01:32:12,052
that he delivered.

652
01:32:12,135 --> 01:32:13,968
It is to their immense credit
that...

653
01:32:14,052 --> 01:32:15,885
not only that they endured it,
um,

654
01:32:15,968 --> 01:32:19,385
but that they did such a great job
the whole time they were there.

655
01:32:19,469 --> 01:32:22,636
WEISS: It's a real testament
to the entire Belfast crew

656
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:25,802
who gave us something that no
amount of money could ever buy.
