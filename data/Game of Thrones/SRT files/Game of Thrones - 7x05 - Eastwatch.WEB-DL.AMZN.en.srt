1
00:00:06,075 --> 00:00:08,034
Clegane, look into the flames.

2
00:00:08,284 --> 00:00:09,575
What do you see?

3
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,367
A wall of ice.

4
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:13,783
The Wall.

5
00:00:15,409 --> 00:00:17,074
The only thing standing
between us

6
00:00:17,075 --> 00:00:18,741
and the army of the dead
is the Wall,

7
00:00:18,742 --> 00:00:21,534
and the Wall hasn't been
properly manned in centuries.

8
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:23,325
Last time we saw The Night King,

9
00:00:23,326 --> 00:00:24,367
it was at Hardhome.

10
00:00:24,783 --> 00:00:27,616
Closest castle to Hardhome
is Eastwatch by the sea.

11
00:00:27,617 --> 00:00:29,377
And that's where I'll go.

12
00:00:29,658 --> 00:00:32,200
Looks like we're
the Nightswatch now.

13
00:00:35,742 --> 00:00:38,576
This suits you, Lady Stark.

14
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:41,992
- Jon left you in charge?
- He did.

15
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,034
- Lord Tarly.
- I believe you know my son.

16
00:00:55,242 --> 00:00:56,700
Do you fight with us...

17
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:59,658
or with the fallen savages
and eunuchs?

18
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:03,033
What do you think I should do?

19
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:05,783
If you use them to melt castles
and burn cities,

20
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:07,200
you're not different.

21
00:01:07,617 --> 00:01:09,284
You're just more of the same.

22
00:01:11,117 --> 00:01:12,451
Listen.

23
00:03:06,384 --> 00:03:16,712

24
00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:50,825
You could've killed me.

25
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:01,283
The fuck were you doing
back there?

26
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:03,575
Ending the war.

27
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,782
Killing her.

28
00:04:05,783 --> 00:04:08,200
You saw the dragon
between you and her?

29
00:04:11,326 --> 00:04:14,200
And?

30
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,782
Listen to me, cunt.

31
00:04:22,783 --> 00:04:24,325
Till I get what I'm owed,

32
00:04:24,326 --> 00:04:26,158
a dragon doesn't
get to kill you,

33
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:28,033
you don't get to kill you,

34
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,492
only I get to kill you.

35
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:35,491
That was only one of them.

36
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:38,325
She has two more.

37
00:04:38,326 --> 00:04:41,408
If she decides to use them,
to really use them...

38
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:44,033
- You're fucked.
- Don't you mean we're fucked?

39
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,033
No, I do not.

40
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:49,199
Dragons are where
our partnership ends.

41
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,824
I'm not gonna be around
when those things

42
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:52,576
start spitting fire
on King's Landing.

43
00:04:54,617 --> 00:04:56,075
I have to tell Cersei.

44
00:04:58,908 --> 00:05:00,867
May as well jump
back in that river.

45
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:18,199
I know what Cersei has told you.

46
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,949
That I've come
to destroy your cities,

47
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,199
burn down your homes,

48
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,950
murder you,
and orphan your children.

49
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:32,575
That's Cersei Lannister, not me.

50
00:06:32,576 --> 00:06:34,782
I'm not here to murder,

51
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:36,533
and all I want to destroy

52
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:39,616
is the wheel that has
rolled over rich and poor

53
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:43,825
to the benefit of no one but the
Cersei Lannisters of the world.

54
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:47,283
I offer you a choice--

55
00:06:47,284 --> 00:06:49,616
bend the knee and join me.

56
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:53,782
Together, we will leave the world
a better place than we found it.

57
00:06:53,783 --> 00:06:56,782
Or refuse...

58
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,284
and die.

59
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:28,825
Step forward, my lord.

60
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:39,949
You will not kneel?

61
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,326
I already have a queen.

62
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:44,033
My sister.

63
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:45,241
She wasn't your queen

64
00:07:45,242 --> 00:07:47,283
until recently, though, was she?

65
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:49,616
When she murdered
your rightful queen

66
00:07:49,617 --> 00:07:52,241
and destroyed House Tyrell
for all time.

67
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:55,534
So it appears your allegiances
are somewhat flexible.

68
00:07:56,658 --> 00:07:59,575
There are
no easy choices in war.

69
00:07:59,576 --> 00:08:01,949
Say what you will
about your sister,

70
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,450
she was born in Westeros.

71
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,700
She's lived here all her life.

72
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,533
You, on the other hand,

73
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:14,283
murdered your own father

74
00:08:14,284 --> 00:08:17,408
and chose to support
a foreign invader.

75
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:20,242
One with no ties to this land...

76
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:24,242
with an army of savages
at her back.

77
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:27,908
You will not trade
your honor for your life.

78
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,366
I respect that.

79
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:34,408
Perhaps he could take
the Black, Your Grace.

80
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:36,824
Whatever else he is,
he is a true soldier.

81
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:39,074
He'd be invaluable at the Wall.

82
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:41,409
You cannot send me to the Wall.

83
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:44,409
You are not my queen.

84
00:08:57,867 --> 00:08:59,199
You will have to kill me, too.

85
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,075
Step back and shut your mouth.

86
00:09:02,617 --> 00:09:04,033
Who are you?

87
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:05,284
A stupid boy.

88
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:08,616
I am Dickon Tarly,

89
00:09:08,617 --> 00:09:10,033
son of Randyll Tarly.

90
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:12,241
You are the future
of your house.

91
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:15,616
This war has already wiped one
great house from the world.

92
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:17,492
Don't let it happen again.
Bend the knee.

93
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,617
I will not.

94
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,657
Your Grace, nothing scrubs
bold notions from a man's head

95
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,241
like a few weeks in a dark cell.

96
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,907
I meant what I said.

97
00:09:38,908 --> 00:09:40,450
I'm not here
to put men in chains.

98
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:42,782
If that becomes an option,
many will take it.

99
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,159
I gave them a choice.

100
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:46,991
They made it.

101
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:50,158
Your Grace, if you start
beheading entire families--

102
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,326
I'm not beheading anyone.

103
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,159
Your Grace.

104
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:27,033
Lord Randyll
Tarly, Dickon Tarly,

105
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:29,699
I, Daenerys of House
Targaryen, First of My Name,

106
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,824
Breaker of Chains,
and Mother of Dragons,

107
00:10:32,825 --> 00:10:34,658
sentence you to die.

108
00:10:38,242 --> 00:10:39,409
Dracarys.

109
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:28,950
My-- my lord...

110
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:40,451
How many men did we lose?

111
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:45,075
We haven't done
a full accounting.

112
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:50,241
It's not only armies
that win wars.

113
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,741
We have the Tyrell gold, we
have the Iron Bank behind us.

114
00:11:52,742 --> 00:11:54,409
We can buy mercenaries.

115
00:11:56,326 --> 00:11:58,199
Not the same as our men,
but they'll fight

116
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,408
if they're well paid,
which they will be.

117
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:03,866
I just saw the Dothraki fight.

118
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:05,491
They'll beat any mercenary army.

119
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,575
They'll beat any army
I've ever seen.

120
00:12:07,576 --> 00:12:10,450
Killing our men wasn't war
for them, it was sport.

121
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:12,657
Her dragon burnt
a thousand wagons.

122
00:12:12,658 --> 00:12:14,907
Qyburn's scorpion fired
bolts bigger than you.

123
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:17,451
They couldn't stop it.
And she has three of them.

124
00:12:19,492 --> 00:12:21,408
This isn't a war we can win.

125
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:22,783
So, what do we do?

126
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,451
Sue for peace?

127
00:12:26,783 --> 00:12:28,366
I sit on her father's throne,

128
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:31,033
the father you betrayed
and murdered.

129
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:33,866
And in her mind, she's winning.

130
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:35,950
What sort of offer
do you think she'd make?

131
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:41,824
Maybe we can count on Tyrion
to intercede on our behalf

132
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:44,200
by way of apology for
murdering our father and son.

133
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,450
He didn't.

134
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:49,450
You saw the crossbow,
you saw his body.

135
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:51,325
I'm not talking about Father.

136
00:12:51,326 --> 00:12:54,866
Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.
He had nothing to do with it.

137
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:58,159
- After all this time, it still amazes me that you--
- It was Olenna.

138
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:02,867
She confessed before she died.

139
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,408
And this was before or after

140
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:10,491
she drank the poison
you so kindly provided her?

141
00:13:10,492 --> 00:13:12,116
After.

142
00:13:12,117 --> 00:13:13,616
And you believed her?

143
00:13:13,617 --> 00:13:16,366
If you were Olenna,
would you rather have seen

144
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:19,034
your granddaughter married
to Joffrey or Tommen?

145
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,782
Which one would Margaery have
been better able to control?

146
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:25,325
Which one would have made Olenna

147
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:28,033
the true ruler
of the Seven Kingdoms?

148
00:13:28,034 --> 00:13:29,908
She was telling the truth.

149
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,492
I shouldn't have
listened to you.

150
00:13:41,284 --> 00:13:43,074
She should have died screaming.

151
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:44,366
She's dead, like her son,

152
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:46,450
her grandchildren,
her whole house.

153
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:50,033
And if we don't find a way out
of this war, we'll follow them.

154
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:52,575
So we fight and die
or we submit and die.

155
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:54,741
I know my choice.

156
00:13:54,742 --> 00:13:57,242
A soldier should know his.

157
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:06,533
They're beautiful, aren't they?

158
00:16:06,534 --> 00:16:09,326
It wasn't the word
I was thinking of, but...

159
00:16:10,576 --> 00:16:13,325
but, yes, they are.

160
00:16:13,326 --> 00:16:14,824
Gorgeous beasts.

161
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:16,741
They're not beasts to me.

162
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,575
No matter how big they get

163
00:16:18,576 --> 00:16:20,741
or how terrifying
to everyone else,

164
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:22,367
they're my children.

165
00:16:28,034 --> 00:16:29,366
You weren't gone long.

166
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:31,533
No.

167
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:33,533
And?

168
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,242
And I have fewer enemies
today than I did yesterday.

169
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:40,991
You're not sure
how you feel about that.

170
00:16:40,992 --> 00:16:42,700
No, I'm not.

171
00:16:44,617 --> 00:16:46,074
How many men did your army kill

172
00:16:46,075 --> 00:16:48,075
taking Winterfell back
from the Boltons?

173
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,616
Thousands.

174
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:52,741
We both want to help people.

175
00:16:52,742 --> 00:16:56,450
We can only help them
from a position of strength.

176
00:16:56,451 --> 00:16:58,534
Sometimes strength is terrible.

177
00:17:01,742 --> 00:17:04,408
When you first came here,

178
00:17:04,409 --> 00:17:08,158
Ser Davos said you took a knife
in the heart for your people.

179
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:09,783
Ser Davos gets carried away.

180
00:17:11,534 --> 00:17:13,241
So, it was a figure of speech?

181
00:17:17,742 --> 00:17:21,103
_

182
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:29,206
_

183
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:34,982
Your Grace.

184
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:44,199
Jon Snow, this is
Ser Jorah Mormont,

185
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,450
an old friend.

186
00:17:46,451 --> 00:17:47,949
I served with your father.

187
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,117
He was a great man.

188
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:53,326
You look strong.

189
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:56,491
You found a cure?

190
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,450
I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

191
00:17:58,451 --> 00:18:02,949
I return to your
service, my queen,

192
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,741
if you'll have me.

193
00:18:04,742 --> 00:18:07,117
It would be my honor.

194
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:48,033
Ravens.

195
00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:49,867
We need to send ravens.

196
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:55,074
I put very little stock
in it myself.

197
00:19:55,075 --> 00:19:57,533
Prophecies of doom
are never in short supply,

198
00:19:57,534 --> 00:19:59,741
especially when winter comes.

199
00:19:59,742 --> 00:20:02,074
I remember Wolkan.

200
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,450
A little timid,
but a sharp mind.

201
00:20:04,451 --> 00:20:07,949
Eh, the North has dulled
many good maesters' wits.

202
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,158
Hard to say whether
it's the cold, the drink,

203
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,949
or the company.

204
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,116
A crippled boy
claims to have seen

205
00:20:14,117 --> 00:20:16,241
dead men on the march
beyond the Wall,

206
00:20:16,242 --> 00:20:19,408
thanks to the magical help
of a raven with three eyes?

207
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:21,074
Yes, it is a bit much.

208
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:23,783
- Still, we ought to write back--
- Brandon Stark.

209
00:20:27,284 --> 00:20:30,451
- The crippled boy.
- Do you know him?

210
00:20:31,617 --> 00:20:33,782
I led him through
the Wall years ago.

211
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:36,949
I saw him go beyond the Wall.

212
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,533
And?

213
00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:41,450
Somehow, a crippled boy

214
00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:43,533
survived for years beyond the
Wall when no one else could.

215
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:47,284
Not the Night's Watch,
not the wildlings, no one.

216
00:20:48,908 --> 00:20:50,991
Perhaps we ought to listen
to what he has to say.

217
00:20:50,992 --> 00:20:54,116
Perhaps you need more scribing
work to discipline your mind.

218
00:20:54,117 --> 00:20:57,534
I sense a more detailed
proposal is forthcoming?

219
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,158
Everyone in Westeros
trusts and respects you.

220
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,325
If you tell people the threat
is real, they'll believe it.

221
00:21:16,326 --> 00:21:18,699
If you advise all the lords
to send their men north

222
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,657
to hold the Wall, they'll do it.

223
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:24,158
And if you tell every
maester in the Citadel

224
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,491
to search every word
of every faded scroll

225
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:28,283
about the Long Night,

226
00:21:28,284 --> 00:21:30,116
they may find something
that lets us defeat

227
00:21:30,117 --> 00:21:32,034
the Army of the Dead for good.

228
00:21:37,117 --> 00:21:38,326
It could be done.

229
00:21:39,742 --> 00:21:42,533
And this news
could be authentic.

230
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,200
It's possible.

231
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,033
It's also possible
that this message

232
00:21:49,034 --> 00:21:51,325
is part of a ploy
by the Dragon Queen

233
00:21:51,326 --> 00:21:54,283
to lure southern armies away from the
lands they are currently defending

234
00:21:54,284 --> 00:21:56,325
to open those lands
to easy conquest.

235
00:21:56,326 --> 00:21:58,033
That does
seem far more likely

236
00:21:58,034 --> 00:21:59,991
than magic birds
talking to cripples.

237
00:21:59,992 --> 00:22:02,533
Archmaester, please.

238
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:03,700
It's real.

239
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:06,700
I've seen it.

240
00:22:09,534 --> 00:22:11,033
We will write to Maester Wolkan

241
00:22:11,034 --> 00:22:13,408
at Winterfell for clarification.

242
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:16,283
I promise you we will get to the
truth of it one way or another.

243
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:18,991
- Archmaester, please--
- That will be all, Tarly.

244
00:22:18,992 --> 00:22:21,491
It brings to mind the
work of Jenny of Oldstones,

245
00:22:21,492 --> 00:22:24,116
the charlatan who claimed descent
from the children of the forest.

246
00:22:24,117 --> 00:22:26,907
Don't forget the prophet Lodos,

247
00:22:26,908 --> 00:22:30,575
who promised that the Drowned God would
rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.

248
00:22:30,576 --> 00:22:32,867
Ah, Lodos.

249
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,699
Is he the one whose father and
brother were just burnt alive?

250
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,657
I'm afraid so.

251
00:22:42,658 --> 00:22:43,907
Horrible business.

252
00:22:43,908 --> 00:22:46,533
I haven't had the heart
to tell him yet.

253
00:22:46,534 --> 00:22:48,575
He's a good lad.

254
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,325
Right.

255
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:53,241
The ravenry was falling apart
the last time I checked.

256
00:22:58,451 --> 00:23:01,074
All rulers demand
that people bend the knee.

257
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:02,284
That's why they're rulers.

258
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:07,408
She gave Tarly a choice,

259
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:10,241
a man who had taken up
arms against her.

260
00:23:10,242 --> 00:23:11,991
What else could she do?

261
00:23:11,992 --> 00:23:15,116
Not burn him alive
alongside his son?

262
00:23:15,117 --> 00:23:17,450
I am her Hand, not her head.

263
00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:19,699
I can't make
her decisions for her.

264
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,991
That's what I used to tell
myself about her father.

265
00:23:22,992 --> 00:23:27,366
I found the traitors, but I wasn't
the one burning them alive.

266
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:30,117
I was only a purveyor
of information.

267
00:23:35,284 --> 00:23:39,325
It's what I told myself when I
watched them beg for mercy--

268
00:23:39,326 --> 00:23:41,907
I'm not the one doing it.

269
00:23:41,908 --> 00:23:44,366
When the pitch of their
screams rose higher--

270
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:46,408
I'm not the one doing it.

271
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:47,991
When their hair caught fire

272
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:50,866
and the smell of their burning
flesh filled the throne room--

273
00:23:50,867 --> 00:23:52,492
I'm not the one doing it.

274
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:03,366
Daenerys is not her father.

275
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:05,782
And she never will be

276
00:24:05,783 --> 00:24:07,825
with the right counsel.

277
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,492
You need to find a way
to make her listen.

278
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,325
- Who's that for?
- Jon Snow.

279
00:24:19,326 --> 00:24:20,866
Did you read it?

280
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:23,908
It's a sealed scroll
for the King in the North.

281
00:24:30,034 --> 00:24:31,492
What's it say?

282
00:24:32,576 --> 00:24:34,159
Nothing good.

283
00:24:40,658 --> 00:24:44,033
I thought Arya was dead.

284
00:24:44,034 --> 00:24:47,116
I thought Bran was dead.

285
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:48,534
I'm happy for you.

286
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:52,325
You don't look happy.

287
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:54,699
Bran saw the Night King
and his army

288
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,700
marching towards Eastwatch.

289
00:24:58,284 --> 00:25:00,283
If they make it past the Wall...

290
00:25:00,284 --> 00:25:02,991
The Wall has kept them out for
thousands of years, presumably.

291
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:04,657
I need to go home.

292
00:25:04,658 --> 00:25:06,366
You said you don't
have enough men.

293
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:08,949
We'll fight
with the men we have.

294
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,575
Unless you'll join us.

295
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:12,741
And give the country to Cersei?

296
00:25:12,742 --> 00:25:16,575
As soon as I march away,
she marches in.

297
00:25:16,576 --> 00:25:18,907
Perhaps not.

298
00:25:18,908 --> 00:25:22,325
Cersei thinks the Army of the
Dead is nothing but a story

299
00:25:22,326 --> 00:25:25,575
made up by wet nurses
to frighten children.

300
00:25:25,576 --> 00:25:27,325
What if we prove her wrong?

301
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:30,742
I don't think she'll come see
the dead at my invitation.

302
00:25:32,034 --> 00:25:34,075
So bring the dead to her.

303
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,408
I thought that was what
we were trying to avoid.

304
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:39,782
We don't have to
bring the whole army.

305
00:25:39,783 --> 00:25:41,824
Only one soldier.

306
00:25:41,825 --> 00:25:43,742
Is that possible?

307
00:25:47,576 --> 00:25:49,283
The first wight I ever saw

308
00:25:49,284 --> 00:25:52,116
was brought into Castle
Black from beyond the Wall.

309
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,450
Bring one of these things
down to King's Landing

310
00:25:54,451 --> 00:25:56,741
and show her the truth.

311
00:25:56,742 --> 00:25:58,782
Anything you bring back
will be useless

312
00:25:58,783 --> 00:26:00,616
unless Cersei
grants us an audience

313
00:26:00,617 --> 00:26:03,158
and is somehow convinced
not to murder us

314
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:05,408
the moment we set foot
in the capital.

315
00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:08,991
The only person
she listens to is Jaime.

316
00:26:08,992 --> 00:26:10,825
He might listen to me.

317
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:16,658
And how would you get
into King's Landing?

318
00:26:22,825 --> 00:26:24,657
I can smuggle you in,

319
00:26:24,658 --> 00:26:27,283
but if the gold cloaks
were to recognize you,

320
00:26:27,284 --> 00:26:30,491
I'm warning you,
I'm not a fighter.

321
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:31,907
Well, it will all be for nothing

322
00:26:31,908 --> 00:26:33,699
if we don't have
one of these dead men.

323
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,074
Fair point.

324
00:26:35,075 --> 00:26:36,367
How do you propose to find one?

325
00:26:39,783 --> 00:26:42,992
With the queen's permission,
I'll go north and take one.

326
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,033
You asked me to find a
cure so I could serve you.

327
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:49,658
Allow me to serve you.

328
00:26:53,658 --> 00:26:55,158
The Free Folk will help us.

329
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:57,907
They know the real north
better than anyone.

330
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,450
They won't follow Ser Jorah.

331
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,658
They won't have to.

332
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,116
You can't lead a raid
beyond the Wall.

333
00:27:10,117 --> 00:27:12,741
You're not in the Night's Watch
anymore, you're King in the North.

334
00:27:12,742 --> 00:27:15,325
I'm the only one here
who's fought them.

335
00:27:15,326 --> 00:27:17,700
I'm the only one here
who knows them.

336
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:21,075
I haven't given you
permission to leave.

337
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:27,283
With respect, Your Grace,
I don't need your permission.

338
00:27:27,284 --> 00:27:28,492
I am a king.

339
00:27:30,117 --> 00:27:31,533
And I came here

340
00:27:31,534 --> 00:27:33,366
knowing that you could
have your men behead me

341
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:36,575
or your dragons burn me alive.

342
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:40,991
I put my trust
in you, a stranger,

343
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,991
because I knew it was the
best chance for my people,

344
00:27:43,992 --> 00:27:46,159
for all our people.

345
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,034
Now I'm asking you
to trust in a stranger...

346
00:27:53,742 --> 00:27:56,242
because it's our best chance.

347
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:18,576
The King in the North
should stay in the North.

348
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:25,491
We did not choose you
to rule us, my lady.

349
00:28:25,492 --> 00:28:28,326
But perhaps we should have.

350
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:35,616
The Knights of the Vale came
here for you, Lady Stark.

351
00:28:35,617 --> 00:28:37,075
Aye.

352
00:28:41,534 --> 00:28:44,949
You are very kind, my lords.

353
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,991
But Jon is our king.

354
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:49,533
He is doing what
he thinks is best.

355
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:01,491
I warned Jon
this would happen.

356
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:03,158
That he couldn't leave the North

357
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,991
and expect it to just sit
and wait for him like Ghost.

358
00:29:05,992 --> 00:29:08,366
He didn't. He trusted
you to hold it for him.

359
00:29:08,367 --> 00:29:11,159
Well, he's not making it easy.
The Northern lords are proud.

360
00:29:15,825 --> 00:29:18,116
These are Mother
and Father's chambers.

361
00:29:18,117 --> 00:29:19,658
And?

362
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:24,699
Nothing.

363
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,491
Don't do that.

364
00:29:27,492 --> 00:29:29,992
- What?
- Say what you mean.

365
00:29:31,658 --> 00:29:34,117
You always liked nice things.

366
00:29:35,492 --> 00:29:37,825
They made you feel
better than everyone.

367
00:29:42,742 --> 00:29:44,325
Are you angry with me?

368
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:46,657
They were insulting Jon,

369
00:29:46,658 --> 00:29:48,033
and you sat there and listened.

370
00:29:48,034 --> 00:29:49,533
I listened to their complaints,

371
00:29:49,534 --> 00:29:52,575
which is my responsibility
as Lady of Winterfell.

372
00:29:52,576 --> 00:29:55,533
Their opinions
are important to you.

373
00:29:55,534 --> 00:29:58,241
Glover has 500 men,
Royce has 2,000.

374
00:29:58,242 --> 00:30:01,199
Offend them
and Jon loses his army.

375
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,200
Not if they lose
their heads first.

376
00:30:06,658 --> 00:30:09,824
Winterfell didn't just
fall into our hands.

377
00:30:09,825 --> 00:30:11,699
We took it back,

378
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,657
and the Mormonts
and the Hornwoods

379
00:30:13,658 --> 00:30:15,116
and the wildlings and the Vale.

380
00:30:15,117 --> 00:30:16,657
All of us, working together.

381
00:30:16,658 --> 00:30:20,991
Now, I'm sure cutting off
heads is very satisfying,

382
00:30:20,992 --> 00:30:24,534
but that's not the way you
get people to work together.

383
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,991
And if Jon doesn't come back,

384
00:30:29,992 --> 00:30:31,949
you'll need their support...

385
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,074
so you can work together

386
00:30:34,075 --> 00:30:36,033
to give you
what you really want.

387
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:38,617
How can you even think
such a horrible thing?

388
00:30:41,326 --> 00:30:43,367
You're thinking it right now.

389
00:30:45,367 --> 00:30:48,325
You don't want to be,

390
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:50,617
but the thought
just won't go away.

391
00:30:56,534 --> 00:30:58,409
I have work to do.

392
00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:03,367
My lady.

393
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:18,657
Last time I was here, I killed
my father with a crossbow.

394
00:31:18,658 --> 00:31:21,617
Last time I was here, you
killed my son with wildfire.

395
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:27,616
There's a path to the left
that hugs the cliff.

396
00:31:27,617 --> 00:31:30,283
The guards
hardly ever patrol it.

397
00:31:30,284 --> 00:31:31,658
Too many steps.

398
00:31:36,534 --> 00:31:37,824
You're not staying here?

399
00:31:37,825 --> 00:31:41,325
I've got my own business
in Flea Bottom.

400
00:31:41,326 --> 00:31:43,158
What if someone takes the boat?

401
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:45,451
Then we're fucked.
Best hurry.

402
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,283
We don't have time for this.

403
00:31:52,284 --> 00:31:54,450
We should be preparing
the city for a siege.

404
00:31:54,451 --> 00:31:55,616
The Dothraki are coming.

405
00:31:55,617 --> 00:31:57,741
All the more reason
for you to train.

406
00:31:57,742 --> 00:31:59,741
Unless you plan on fighting
Dothraki 12-year-olds.

407
00:31:59,742 --> 00:32:02,283
Well, I seem to recall them giving
you a bit of trouble as well.

408
00:32:02,284 --> 00:32:04,283
And here I am, ready to train.

409
00:32:04,284 --> 00:32:06,241
Why down here?

410
00:32:06,242 --> 00:32:08,074
I don't think
you want people to see

411
00:32:08,075 --> 00:32:10,991
how you look swinging
that thing yet.

412
00:32:10,992 --> 00:32:13,782
Today might be the day
I kill you by accident.

413
00:32:13,783 --> 00:32:16,326
Oh, you won't be
swinging it at me.

414
00:32:24,534 --> 00:32:26,200
I'll leave you to it.

415
00:32:29,992 --> 00:32:31,326
I needed to see you.

416
00:32:32,783 --> 00:32:34,617
And I knew you'd
never agree to meet.

417
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,116
You made me look
like a complete fool.

418
00:32:41,117 --> 00:32:43,408
I thought I'd surprise you
by hitting Casterly Rock,

419
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:46,366
but you were
three steps ahead of me.

420
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:48,949
Abandoned the family home,
completely unsentimental.

421
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,450
Father would have been proud.

422
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:52,199
- Don't talk about Father.
- Listen to me--

423
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,699
I once told Bronn

424
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,534
that if I ever saw you
again, I'd cut you in half.

425
00:32:59,534 --> 00:33:02,034
It'll take you a while
with a sparring sword.

426
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,116
He was going to execute me.

427
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:15,824
He knew I was innocent.

428
00:33:15,825 --> 00:33:18,158
He didn't hate me
because of anything I did,

429
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,533
he hated me
because of what I am.

430
00:33:20,534 --> 00:33:23,700
A little monster
sent to punish him.

431
00:33:25,576 --> 00:33:27,782
Did he--
did he think--

432
00:33:27,783 --> 00:33:29,575
did he think I wanted
to be born this way?

433
00:33:29,576 --> 00:33:31,456
- Did he think I chose it--
- What do you want?!

434
00:33:37,992 --> 00:33:39,534
Daenerys will win this war.

435
00:33:41,908 --> 00:33:43,325
You're a military man.

436
00:33:43,326 --> 00:33:46,075
You must know there's
no way around that.

437
00:33:48,117 --> 00:33:49,699
Daenerys is not her father.

438
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,575
She's even willing
to suspend the hostilities

439
00:33:52,576 --> 00:33:55,075
if Cersei agrees
to certain terms.

440
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,616
If you want Cersei
to bend the knee,

441
00:33:57,617 --> 00:33:59,074
you can ask her yourself.

442
00:33:59,075 --> 00:34:01,451
I-- I don't.
And Daenerys doesn't.

443
00:34:02,867 --> 00:34:04,576
Not right now, anyway.

444
00:34:06,742 --> 00:34:08,992
She has a more
important request.

445
00:34:48,492 --> 00:34:50,700
I wasn't sure I'd find you.

446
00:34:57,992 --> 00:34:59,991
Thought you might
still be rowing.

447
00:35:03,617 --> 00:35:06,699
I looked in shops,
taverns, brothels.

448
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,991
Should have known to come
straight to the Street of Steel.

449
00:35:09,992 --> 00:35:12,491
Aren't you worried
about the gold cloaks?

450
00:35:12,492 --> 00:35:13,907
Haven't been here in years.

451
00:35:13,908 --> 00:35:16,325
Why should they recognize me?

452
00:35:16,326 --> 00:35:18,992
Sometimes I hardly do.

453
00:35:20,658 --> 00:35:22,825
Nothing fucks you
harder than time.

454
00:35:27,617 --> 00:35:29,699
Anybody give you any trouble?

455
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,158
Here I am, arming Lannisters,

456
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:34,033
and I never get a second look.

457
00:35:34,034 --> 00:35:35,533
But you were right.

458
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:38,074
Safest place for me was
right under the queen's nose.

459
00:35:38,075 --> 00:35:39,575
Don't be so sure.

460
00:35:39,576 --> 00:35:42,492
Safety is never a permanent
state of affairs.

461
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,242
Bad things are coming.

462
00:35:48,742 --> 00:35:51,963
You came to get me.
You want me to come with you.

463
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,122
Well, the thing you need to
understand is--

464
00:35:53,242 --> 00:35:53,812
I'm ready.

465
00:35:53,932 --> 00:35:55,283
- You--
- Let's go.

466
00:35:55,284 --> 00:35:57,199
You should know
what you're heading into.

467
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,199
What do you think
I've been thinking about

468
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,575
with every swing of the hammer?

469
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:03,033
How happy I am making weapons

470
00:36:03,034 --> 00:36:05,491
for the family
that killed my father?

471
00:36:05,492 --> 00:36:07,199
The family that
tried to kill me?

472
00:36:09,326 --> 00:36:11,575
I've been getting ready.

473
00:36:11,576 --> 00:36:13,033
I never knew what for,

474
00:36:13,034 --> 00:36:15,576
but I've always known
I'd know it when it comes.

475
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:20,325
You might want to bring
one of those swords.

476
00:36:20,326 --> 00:36:22,242
I don't know much
about swinging swords.

477
00:36:23,742 --> 00:36:25,075
But this...

478
00:36:26,908 --> 00:36:28,242
this I know.

479
00:36:37,326 --> 00:36:38,741
Keep your father's name
to yourself.

480
00:36:38,742 --> 00:36:41,534
Situation's complicated
enough already.

481
00:36:42,908 --> 00:36:44,576
Well, who should I say I am?

482
00:36:48,409 --> 00:36:50,824
I told you, Clovis, if we
don't get out of here soon,

483
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:52,665
- someone's going to--
- You there!

484
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:57,284
No weapons, friends.
I promise.

485
00:36:58,492 --> 00:36:59,949
What can I do for you?

486
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:02,450
- Is that your boat?
- It is.

487
00:37:02,451 --> 00:37:04,866
- The docks are that way.
- That they are.

488
00:37:04,867 --> 00:37:06,366
I try to stay away from them

489
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:08,617
to avoid good men
such as yourselves.

490
00:37:11,242 --> 00:37:14,616
- Still five gold dragons?
- Are you joking?

491
00:37:14,617 --> 00:37:16,866
You must be even older
than you look.

492
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,782
- 15.
- 15?!

493
00:37:18,783 --> 00:37:19,908
Apiece.

494
00:37:28,326 --> 00:37:30,451
I can't say it was a pleasure
doing business with you.

495
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,326
What's in the boat?

496
00:37:39,867 --> 00:37:41,033
Not more gold.

497
00:37:41,034 --> 00:37:42,782
- Wine?
- Mm.

498
00:37:42,783 --> 00:37:44,783
- I like wine.
- Or hams.

499
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,825
Come have a look.

500
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:58,283
- Fermented crab.
- What?

501
00:37:58,284 --> 00:38:00,158
Fermented crab.

502
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:03,158
One bucket of this triples a
brothel's earnings for the week.

503
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:05,116
A man thinks he's done.

504
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:07,699
He's ready to go back
to his loving family.

505
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,616
But before he gets
his breeches up,

506
00:38:09,617 --> 00:38:12,991
his lady of the hour pops a tiny
spoon of that into his mouth.

507
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:16,533
Five minutes later,
he's back in the race.

508
00:38:16,534 --> 00:38:19,034
Here, have a taste.

509
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,575
I'd hurry to your
favorite establishment,

510
00:38:33,576 --> 00:38:36,074
or you'll put a hole
in that chainmail.

511
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:05,075
Oi, dwarf!

512
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:07,949
I really wouldn't try any more

513
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,991
until you see how
the first bite hits you.

514
00:39:09,992 --> 00:39:11,866
That dwarf...

515
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:13,491
Where'd you get that scar?

516
00:39:13,492 --> 00:39:16,033
Fish hook. Some men
you just can't teach.

517
00:39:16,034 --> 00:39:19,116
We was looking for a dwarf with
a scar like that a while back.

518
00:39:19,117 --> 00:39:21,158
Perhaps there's
some arrangement?

519
00:39:23,576 --> 00:39:25,533
Arrangement?

520
00:39:25,534 --> 00:39:28,741
You gonna arrange to pay us
more than Queen Cersei--

521
00:39:36,576 --> 00:39:38,283
This is Gendry.

522
00:39:38,284 --> 00:39:39,783
He'll do.

523
00:39:42,492 --> 00:39:43,492
Go, go, go.

524
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,782
I could give you something.

525
00:39:47,783 --> 00:39:49,284
That won't be necessary.

526
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:58,950
Ser Jaime.

527
00:40:01,783 --> 00:40:04,451
Why was Qyburn here?

528
00:40:05,867 --> 00:40:08,117
He's the Hand of the Queen.
Why are you here?

529
00:40:12,783 --> 00:40:15,326
I met with Tyrion.

530
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,950
What did our brother
have to say?

531
00:40:28,534 --> 00:40:30,991
Daenerys wants to meet.

532
00:40:30,992 --> 00:40:33,616
To discuss her surrender?

533
00:40:33,617 --> 00:40:35,450
To discuss an armistice.

534
00:40:35,451 --> 00:40:38,241
She's just won a great victory.
Why would she want a truce now?

535
00:40:38,242 --> 00:40:39,991
Because an army of dead men

536
00:40:39,992 --> 00:40:42,534
is marching
on the Seven Kingdoms.

537
00:40:45,034 --> 00:40:46,866
Tyrion claims he'll have proof.

538
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:53,116
- Are you going to punish him?
- Tyrion?

539
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,617
Bronn.

540
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:59,533
He betrayed you.

541
00:40:59,534 --> 00:41:01,908
He set up a meeting without
your knowledge or consent.

542
00:41:05,742 --> 00:41:07,033
Do you think
anything of importance

543
00:41:07,034 --> 00:41:09,533
happens in this city
without me knowing?

544
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:12,782
You let it happen.
Why?

545
00:41:12,783 --> 00:41:15,450
I've come to believe that

546
00:41:15,451 --> 00:41:18,158
an accommodation
with the Dragon Queen

547
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:20,699
could be in our
immediate interest.

548
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:24,033
She has the numbers. If we want to
beat her, we have to be clever.

549
00:41:24,034 --> 00:41:26,200
We have to fight her
like Father would have.

550
00:41:29,658 --> 00:41:32,825
Dead men, dragons,
and Dragon Queens...

551
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,866
Whatever stands in our way,

552
00:41:37,867 --> 00:41:39,616
we will defeat it.

553
00:41:39,617 --> 00:41:42,408
For ourselves, for our house,

554
00:41:42,409 --> 00:41:44,409
for this.

555
00:41:57,034 --> 00:41:58,616
Who will you say is the father?

556
00:41:58,617 --> 00:41:59,908
You.

557
00:42:05,825 --> 00:42:07,075
People won't like that.

558
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:15,116
Do you remember what Father
used to say about people?

559
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:19,075
The lion does not concern himself
with the opinions of the sheep.

560
00:42:32,992 --> 00:42:34,950
Never betray me again.

561
00:42:40,034 --> 00:42:41,949
We're leaving today.

562
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:45,533
- The king's got a lot on his mind.
- I understand.

563
00:42:45,534 --> 00:42:48,116
He doesn't need to be thinking about
harboring the bastard of a dead king.

564
00:42:48,117 --> 00:42:50,575
- You don't have to worry.
- You're just Clovis,

565
00:42:50,576 --> 00:42:52,907
a smith who's come
to pay his respects

566
00:42:52,908 --> 00:42:55,907
before he heads off to work
at the Winterfell forges.

567
00:42:55,908 --> 00:42:57,907
Understood.

568
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:01,533
Begging your pardon, Your Grace.

569
00:43:01,534 --> 00:43:02,991
You survived King's Landing.

570
00:43:02,992 --> 00:43:05,991
Yet again. Your
Grace, this is Clo--

571
00:43:05,992 --> 00:43:08,408
Name's Gendry, Your Grace.

572
00:43:08,409 --> 00:43:09,991
I'm Robert Baratheon's son.

573
00:43:09,992 --> 00:43:11,117
Bastard son.

574
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,657
He was meant
to keep that to himself.

575
00:43:16,658 --> 00:43:18,491
Our fathers trusted each other.

576
00:43:18,492 --> 00:43:19,825
Why shouldn't we?

577
00:43:22,117 --> 00:43:24,616
I saw your father once
at Winterfell.

578
00:43:24,617 --> 00:43:27,825
I met yours in my shop.

579
00:43:29,534 --> 00:43:31,867
- You're a lot leaner.
- And you're a lot shorter.

580
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:45,741
I grew up on stories about them.

581
00:43:45,742 --> 00:43:48,742
All I ever knew is that
they fought together and won.

582
00:43:50,492 --> 00:43:53,283
Ser Davos told me where you're
going, Your Grace, and why.

583
00:43:53,284 --> 00:43:55,074
Let me come with you.

584
00:43:55,075 --> 00:43:56,949
Don't be a fool.
You're not a soldier.

585
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,782
No, but I'm a fighter.

586
00:43:58,783 --> 00:44:01,867
And he won't be needing a
smith with a sword like that.

587
00:44:04,284 --> 00:44:05,782
You know how to use one?

588
00:44:05,783 --> 00:44:08,158
Well, that's a problem.

589
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:09,700
I prefer a hammer.

590
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,409
He can handle himself.

591
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,283
We could use the help.

592
00:44:18,284 --> 00:44:20,158
As my father used to say,

593
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:22,241
"It's better to be
a coward for a minute,

594
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,491
than dead for
the rest of your life."

595
00:44:24,492 --> 00:44:26,907
I owe you my life.

596
00:44:26,908 --> 00:44:28,699
Twice over.

597
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,949
But if what you said is true
about what's up there,

598
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:34,409
I can't wait out this war.

599
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,116
Yeah, nobody mind me.

600
00:44:40,117 --> 00:44:44,158
All I've ever done
is live to a ripe old age.

601
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,074
All right, come on.

602
00:44:55,658 --> 00:44:57,907
You may not believe it,

603
00:44:57,908 --> 00:45:00,616
but I've missed you, Mormont.

604
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:03,741
Nobody glowers quite like you.

605
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,034
Not even Grey Worm.

606
00:45:10,825 --> 00:45:12,782
This is the coin
the slaver gave me

607
00:45:12,783 --> 00:45:15,782
when I suggested he free us
and pay us, remember?

608
00:45:15,783 --> 00:45:19,617
It was supposed to last us
the rest of our lives.

609
00:45:24,075 --> 00:45:25,451
Take it with you.

610
00:45:28,117 --> 00:45:29,616
But bring it back.

611
00:45:29,617 --> 00:45:30,783
Our queen needs you.

612
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:42,617
We should be better
at saying farewell by now.

613
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:45,783
Your Grace, I...

614
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,450
If I don't return, at least
you won't have to deal

615
00:46:05,451 --> 00:46:06,811
with the King
in the North anymore.

616
00:46:09,117 --> 00:46:10,992
I've grown used to him.

617
00:46:13,075 --> 00:46:15,700
I wish you good fortune in the
wars to come, Your Grace.

618
00:46:24,783 --> 00:46:26,451
Heave!

619
00:46:49,576 --> 00:46:54,033
Do you know how many
steps there are in the Citadel?

620
00:46:54,034 --> 00:46:55,241
No.

621
00:46:55,242 --> 00:46:58,200
15,782.

622
00:47:02,783 --> 00:47:06,200
Guess how many windows are
in the Great Sept of Baelor.

623
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:10,866
None anymore.

624
00:47:10,867 --> 00:47:12,533
That's true.

625
00:47:12,534 --> 00:47:16,866
This High Septon Maynard,
he recorded everything.

626
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:19,075
He even recorded
his own bowel movements.

627
00:47:22,617 --> 00:47:25,824
What does "annulment" mean?

628
00:47:25,825 --> 00:47:29,699
It's when a man
sets aside his lawful wife.

629
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:35,074
Maynard says here that he issued
an annulment for a Prince "Ragger"

630
00:47:35,075 --> 00:47:38,575
and remarried him to someone
else at the same time

631
00:47:38,576 --> 00:47:41,116
in a secret ceremony in Dorne.

632
00:47:41,117 --> 00:47:43,033
Is that a common thing
in the south or--?

633
00:47:43,034 --> 00:47:44,409
These maesters...

634
00:47:46,284 --> 00:47:49,866
they set me to the task of preserving
that man's window counting

635
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,158
and annulments and bowel
movements for all eternity,

636
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:53,949
while the secret to
defeating the Night King's

637
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:56,616
probably sitting on some dusty shelf
somewhere, completely ignored.

638
00:47:56,617 --> 00:47:58,533
But that's all right, isn't it?

639
00:47:58,534 --> 00:48:02,616
We can all become slavering, murderous
imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate

640
00:48:02,617 --> 00:48:04,241
as long as we can have access
to the full records

641
00:48:04,242 --> 00:48:08,284
of High Septon Maynard's
15,782 shits!

642
00:48:10,617 --> 00:48:12,242
Steps.

643
00:48:15,284 --> 00:48:17,409
That number was the steps.

644
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:41,949
Are you sure
you want to do this?

645
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,367
You always wanted
to be a maester.

646
00:49:45,992 --> 00:49:50,159
I'm tired of reading about
the achievements of better men.

647
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,117
I found it, my lord.

648
00:51:24,825 --> 00:51:26,533
It, uh, took some searching.

649
00:51:26,534 --> 00:51:28,617
Maester Luwin's archives
are very thorough.

650
00:51:33,326 --> 00:51:35,949
You're sure this is the
only copy in Winterfell?

651
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:37,825
Uh, yes, my lord.

652
00:51:42,617 --> 00:51:44,534
Lady Stark thanks you
for your service.

653
00:54:16,658 --> 00:54:18,533
Isn't it your
job to talk him out

654
00:54:18,534 --> 00:54:20,533
of stupid fucking
ideas like this?

655
00:54:20,534 --> 00:54:23,326
I've been failing
at that job of late.

656
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:26,991
How many queens are there now?

657
00:54:26,992 --> 00:54:28,325
Two.

658
00:54:28,326 --> 00:54:31,491
And you need to convince
the one with the dragons

659
00:54:31,492 --> 00:54:33,325
or the one who
fucks her brother?

660
00:54:35,159 --> 00:54:36,159
Both.

661
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,200
How many men did you bring?

662
00:54:41,284 --> 00:54:42,824
Not enough.

663
00:54:42,825 --> 00:54:44,451
The big woman?

664
00:54:47,783 --> 00:54:50,575
We were hoping some of
your men could help.

665
00:54:50,576 --> 00:54:53,408
- Hmm.
- I'll be staying behind.

666
00:54:53,409 --> 00:54:56,533
I'm a liability out there,
as you well know.

667
00:54:56,534 --> 00:54:57,534
You are.

668
00:55:00,326 --> 00:55:03,534
You really want to go out there?
Again?

669
00:55:09,825 --> 00:55:11,576
You're not the only ones.

670
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,699
My scouts found them
a mile south of the Wall.

671
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,576
Said they were
on their way here.

672
00:55:27,409 --> 00:55:28,867
You're the Hound.

673
00:55:30,867 --> 00:55:32,700
I saw you once at Winterfell.

674
00:55:38,409 --> 00:55:40,575
They want to go
beyond the Wall, too.

675
00:55:40,576 --> 00:55:43,866
We don't want to go beyond
the Wall, we have to.

676
00:55:43,867 --> 00:55:46,033
Our Lord told us that
the Great War is coming--

677
00:55:46,034 --> 00:55:48,241
Don't trust him.

678
00:55:48,242 --> 00:55:50,200
Don't trust any of them.

679
00:55:55,825 --> 00:55:57,450
They're the Brotherhood.

680
00:55:57,451 --> 00:56:00,033
And the last thing
their lord told them to do

681
00:56:00,034 --> 00:56:02,408
was sell me to a red witch
to be murdered.

682
00:56:02,409 --> 00:56:04,117
Thoros?

683
00:56:09,159 --> 00:56:11,241
I hardly recognized you.

684
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:13,450
Ser Jorah Mormont.

685
00:56:13,451 --> 00:56:16,408
They won't give me anything
to drink down here.

686
00:56:16,409 --> 00:56:19,450
I haven't been feeling
like myself.

687
00:56:19,451 --> 00:56:22,283
You're a fucking Mormont?

688
00:56:22,284 --> 00:56:24,408
Like the last Lord Commander?

689
00:56:24,409 --> 00:56:26,616
He was my father.

690
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:29,616
He hunted us like animals.

691
00:56:29,617 --> 00:56:32,657
You returned the favor,
as I recall.

692
00:56:34,326 --> 00:56:36,949
Here we all are

693
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:38,533
at the edge of the world

694
00:56:38,534 --> 00:56:40,116
at the same moment,

695
00:56:40,117 --> 00:56:42,617
heading in the same direction
for the same reason.

696
00:56:44,451 --> 00:56:46,699
Our reasons aren't your reasons.

697
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,075
It doesn't matter
what we think our reasons are.

698
00:56:51,284 --> 00:56:53,074
There's a greater
purpose at work.

699
00:56:53,075 --> 00:56:56,366
And we serve it together,

700
00:56:56,367 --> 00:56:58,657
whether we know it or not.

701
00:56:58,658 --> 00:57:01,575
We may take the steps,
but the Lord of Light--

702
00:57:01,576 --> 00:57:04,949
For fuck's sake,
will you shut your hole?

703
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:07,741
Are we coming with you or not?
