2
00:02:40,303 --> 00:02:43,638
Give him another go, Ned.

3
00:02:43,723 --> 00:02:45,640
That's my father.

4
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:47,975
And my Uncle Benjen.

5
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:51,145
Keep your shield up or I'll
ring your head like a bell.

6
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:01,656
They were all so happy.

7
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:04,742
So were you once.

8
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:13,301
Stop showing off.

9
00:03:13,386 --> 00:03:14,969
Lyanna!

10
00:03:15,054 --> 00:03:16,754
My Aunt Lyanna.

11
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:19,257
<i>I've seen her statue in the crypt.</i>

12
00:03:19,342 --> 00:03:22,760
My father never talked about her.

13
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:31,352
<i>Would you get out of here?
We're sparring.</i>

14
00:03:31,437 --> 00:03:35,606
Who are you gonna spar with
when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?

15
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:36,774
<i>I don't know.</i>

16
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:38,442
What about him?

17
00:03:39,862 --> 00:03:42,079
Wylis, come here.

18
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,337
Hodor?

19
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:51,422
<i>But he's got giant's blood.</i>

20
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:55,042
And you've got training. Sounds
like a fair match to me.

21
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:57,762
Benjen always lifts his chin
when he's about to charge.

22
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,631
And lowers it when he's
going to dodge, my lady.

23
00:04:00,717 --> 00:04:02,800
Hodor talks?

24
00:04:08,057 --> 00:04:11,025
You leave the fighting
to the little lords, Wylis.

25
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,561
Come along, now.
It's no place for you.

26
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,197
Oh, Nan, look at the size of him.

27
00:04:16,282 --> 00:04:18,566
If he ever learned to
fight, he'd be unstoppable.

28
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:21,652
Well, he's never going to learn to
fight because he's a stable boy.

29
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:23,571
So leave him be.

30
00:04:23,706 --> 00:04:25,957
It is time to go.

31
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:28,075
Please, a little longer.

32
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,841
You finally show me
something I care about

33
00:04:43,926 --> 00:04:45,426
and then you drag me away.

34
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:49,230
It is beautiful beneath the sea,

35
00:04:49,315 --> 00:04:51,599
but if you stay too long,
you'll drown.

36
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:55,770
I wasn't drowning.
I was home.

37
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:11,118
Wylis.

38
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:12,870
Hodor.

39
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:14,672
I saw you as a boy.

40
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,625
You could talk.

41
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,294
What happened?

42
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,263
Hodor.

43
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:28,219
Where's Meera?

44
00:05:30,473 --> 00:05:32,356
Hodor.

45
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:00,167
You shouldn't be here.

46
00:06:00,253 --> 00:06:02,970
It's not safe outside the cave.

47
00:06:03,056 --> 00:06:04,755
It's not safe anywhere.

48
00:06:08,177 --> 00:06:10,478
I saw that Hodor wasn't always Hodor.

49
00:06:10,563 --> 00:06:12,680
- Hodor.
- <i>His real name is Wylis.</i>

50
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:16,901
And he could talk and
fight and-- and then--

51
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,236
What's wrong?

52
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:25,359
The Three-Eyed Raven
says there's a war coming.

53
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:27,661
And we're going to fight it in there?

54
00:06:57,143 --> 00:06:59,226
Brandon Stark needs you.

55
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:04,281
For what?
I sit in there

56
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,700
and I watch him have his visions
and nothing ever happens.

57
00:07:06,786 --> 00:07:09,370
He isn't going to stay here forever.

58
00:07:09,455 --> 00:07:12,907
And out there he needs you.

59
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:41,569
<i>It's time, Ser Davos.</i>

60
00:07:41,654 --> 00:07:43,988
Open the door and the men inside

61
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:46,357
can rejoin their brothers in peace.

62
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:56,417
We'll even set the wolf free north
of the Wall where it belongs.

63
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:02,039
Nobody needs to die tonight.

64
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:08,095
I've never been much of a fighter.

65
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:17,438
Apologies for what
you're about to see.

66
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:26,447
Come on.

67
00:09:13,195 --> 00:09:14,695
Attack!

68
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:24,755
Fight, you cowards!

69
00:09:56,989 --> 00:09:59,073
You fucking traitor.

70
00:09:59,158 --> 00:10:01,241
The only traitors here are the ones

71
00:10:01,377 --> 00:10:04,328
who shoved their knives into
their Lord Commander's heart.

72
00:10:04,413 --> 00:10:07,915
For thousands of years
the Night's Watch

73
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,634
has held Castle Black
against the wildlings.

74
00:10:10,753 --> 00:10:12,753
Until you.

75
00:10:22,598 --> 00:10:25,766
Throw them into the cells
where they belong.

76
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,884
<i>Took a lot of knives.</i>

77
00:11:04,023 --> 00:11:06,640
I'll have my men
get the wood for a fire.

78
00:11:07,893 --> 00:11:09,443
Bodies to burn.

79
00:11:17,236 --> 00:11:20,454
<i>Shh, hey.</i>

80
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:24,074
Right, so there she is,
high and mighty Queen Cersei,

81
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,326
tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.

82
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:29,413
All of a sudden she looks my way.

83
00:11:29,498 --> 00:11:32,383
Gives me a little smile
like, "Well?"

84
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:34,918
So, all right, you know,
I've never been shy

85
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:37,671
and I'm blessed down south,
so I put it right out.

86
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:40,674
She's never seen anything like it.

87
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,143
I mean, she's used to her
brother and from what I hear,

88
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:45,429
Jaime Lannister's half
an inch shy of an inch.

89
00:11:45,514 --> 00:11:47,264
Ooh!

90
00:11:47,349 --> 00:11:51,318
She sees it and I swear to
the gods she licks her lips.

91
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:54,021
Well, you all know me.

92
00:11:54,106 --> 00:11:56,156
You know I wouldn't lie about this.

93
00:13:14,186 --> 00:13:15,486
Get out of my way.

94
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:17,571
King's orders, Your Grace.

95
00:13:20,826 --> 00:13:22,409
What are the king's orders?

96
00:13:22,495 --> 00:13:25,279
He would like you to remain
in the Red Keep, Your Grace,

97
00:13:25,414 --> 00:13:26,663
for your own protection.

98
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:31,285
You're barring me from attending
my own daughter's funeral?

99
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:35,422
Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king's
command, I cannot let you pass.

100
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:39,092
I would like to speak to my son.

101
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:41,628
He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace.

102
00:14:11,744 --> 00:14:14,077
She grew up.

103
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:16,163
<i>Almost.</i>

104
00:14:16,298 --> 00:14:18,916
Have we caught Prince
Trystane's killers?

105
00:14:21,303 --> 00:14:23,420
I expect it was Mother.

106
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:25,505
Your mother wouldn't do that.

107
00:14:25,591 --> 00:14:26,924
Yes, she would.

108
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:32,095
Are you angry with her?

109
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:35,098
- Of course not.
- Then why didn't you let her come?

110
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:37,901
She has every right to be here.

111
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,522
They told me she wouldn't
be allowed in the sept.

112
00:14:42,658 --> 00:14:44,409
If she had tried--

113
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:46,609
They're not putting
your mother in a cell ever again.

114
00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:48,912
Not while I'm here.

115
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,917
Why haven't you gone to see her?

116
00:14:57,623 --> 00:14:59,957
Everything she endured,
she did it for you.

117
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:02,426
Don't you think I know that?

118
00:15:06,382 --> 00:15:08,181
I'm sorry.

119
00:15:10,185 --> 00:15:12,019
But I can't.

120
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:13,470
Why not?

121
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,475
When the Faith Militant
seized her and Margaery,

122
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,444
what did I do?

123
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:25,732
When they paraded her through
the streets like a whore,

124
00:15:25,818 --> 00:15:27,618
what did I do?

125
00:15:28,737 --> 00:15:31,071
We all fail sometimes.

126
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:34,574
The king is supposed to be
the Protector of the Realm.

127
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,128
If I can't even protect my
own wife or my own mother,

128
00:15:38,247 --> 00:15:39,913
what good am I?

129
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:43,083
Go and see your mother
and ask her to forgive you.

130
00:15:45,554 --> 00:15:47,754
Your Grace.

131
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,556
Lord Commander.

132
00:15:49,642 --> 00:15:52,392
I want to see my wife.

133
00:15:52,478 --> 00:15:54,811
The gods wait for Queen Margaery

134
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,315
to confess her crimes
and seek their mercy.

135
00:15:58,434 --> 00:16:01,351
The king must wait as well.

136
00:16:01,437 --> 00:16:03,904
Go and see your mother, Tommen.

137
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:16,283
You're a bold man.

138
00:16:17,953 --> 00:16:19,503
On the contrary.

139
00:16:19,621 --> 00:16:22,205
I fear a great deal.

140
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:25,459
The Father, the Mother,

141
00:16:25,594 --> 00:16:27,711
the Warrior.

142
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,857
Do you know why we use these stones?

143
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:45,445
To remind us not to fear death.

144
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:48,815
We close our eyes on this world
and open them on the next.

145
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:51,151
You must long for the next life.

146
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:54,654
In truth, I fear that, too.

147
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,708
You imprisoned
and humiliated my sister.

148
00:16:57,826 --> 00:17:00,460
Your sister sought the gods' mercy

149
00:17:00,546 --> 00:17:02,329
and atoned for her sin.

150
00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:04,631
What about my sins?

151
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:10,420
I broke a sacred oath and
stabbed my king in the back.

152
00:17:12,307 --> 00:17:14,725
I killed my own cousin.

153
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:16,760
When the gods judged
my brother guilty,

154
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:19,179
I helped him escape their justice.

155
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:23,433
What atonement do I deserve?

156
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:28,071
You would spill blood
in this holy place?

157
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,607
Oh, the gods won't mind.

158
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:33,160
They've spilled more blood
than the rest of us combined.

159
00:17:35,114 --> 00:17:37,280
Go on, then.

160
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:41,001
I deserve it.
We all do.

161
00:17:41,086 --> 00:17:43,703
We are weak, vain creatures.

162
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:46,673
We live only by the Mother's mercy.

163
00:18:01,974 --> 00:18:04,975
They should be closer if you
mean for them to save you.

164
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,943
I don't.

165
00:18:07,062 --> 00:18:09,946
They'd never reach me
before you struck.

166
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:11,731
I've fought against worse odds.

167
00:18:11,817 --> 00:18:14,785
No doubt many of us would fall.

168
00:18:14,903 --> 00:18:17,904
But who are we, hmm?

169
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,707
We have no names, no family.

170
00:18:20,793 --> 00:18:24,711
Every one of us
is poor and powerless.

171
00:18:24,797 --> 00:18:27,214
And yet together,

172
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,966
we can overthrow an empire.

173
00:19:00,282 --> 00:19:01,865
<i>Mother.</i>

174
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:16,263
Did they put her in the
red gown or the gold?

175
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:19,466
Gold.

176
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:22,052
Good. It was always her color.

177
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:27,607
I'm sorry for keeping you here.

178
00:19:29,978 --> 00:19:32,362
<i>I shouldn't have,
but I was--</i>

179
00:19:34,983 --> 00:19:38,201
I didn't want to lose you again.

180
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,120
I understand.

181
00:19:42,324 --> 00:19:44,124
I'm glad to see you.

182
00:19:47,329 --> 00:19:49,829
I know I should have come sooner.

183
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:53,300
I wanted to.
I was wrong.

184
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,586
It's all right.

185
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:01,591
No, it isn't.

186
00:20:03,345 --> 00:20:06,012
I should have executed all of them.

187
00:20:06,148 --> 00:20:07,931
I should have pulled down the sept

188
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:12,102
onto the High Sparrow's head
before I let them do that to you,

189
00:20:12,187 --> 00:20:14,521
as you would have for me.

190
00:20:15,657 --> 00:20:18,191
You raised me to be strong...

191
00:20:20,362 --> 00:20:21,945
and I wasn't.

192
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:25,415
But I want to be.

193
00:20:28,036 --> 00:20:29,836
Help me.

194
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:35,875
Always.

195
00:21:04,122 --> 00:21:06,790
If I lost my cock,
I'd drink all the time.

196
00:21:10,912 --> 00:21:13,246
Meaning no offense.

197
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:16,166
He makes dwarf jokes,
I make eunuch jokes.

198
00:21:16,251 --> 00:21:17,550
I do not make dwarf jokes.

199
00:21:17,636 --> 00:21:19,753
You think them.

200
00:21:19,838 --> 00:21:24,257
So, the fleet.
It's been burned.

201
00:21:24,393 --> 00:21:28,178
We are searching for the men who burned
the ships, but nobody saw anything.

202
00:21:28,263 --> 00:21:30,730
Surely there's some good
news lurking somewhere.

203
00:21:30,816 --> 00:21:33,900
Astapor and Yunkai have
stopped asking us for aid.

204
00:21:33,986 --> 00:21:36,603
Perhaps they can
tell us their secret.

205
00:21:36,738 --> 00:21:39,189
The Masters have retaken both cities.

206
00:21:39,274 --> 00:21:43,943
Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's
Bay has returned to the slavers.

207
00:21:45,914 --> 00:21:50,000
What about the dragons? We have two
of them here beneath the pyramid.

208
00:21:50,118 --> 00:21:51,835
They are not eating.

209
00:21:51,953 --> 00:21:54,704
They haven't touched any food
since Queen Daenerys left.

210
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,507
Daenerys is the dragon queen.

211
00:21:57,626 --> 00:22:00,460
Can't very well let the dragons
starve, that's obvious.

212
00:22:00,545 --> 00:22:03,880
If a dragon does not want to eat,
how do you force him to eat?

213
00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:06,266
Dragons do not do well in captivity.

214
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:08,718
- How do you know this?
- That's what I do.

215
00:22:08,804 --> 00:22:11,771
I drink and I know things.

216
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:16,976
The dragons Aegon used
to conquer Westeros

217
00:22:17,062 --> 00:22:19,562
ranged over hundreds of miles.

218
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,448
Then Daenerys's ancestors

219
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:24,367
started chaining them up in pens.

220
00:22:24,486 --> 00:22:26,453
A few generations later,

221
00:22:26,538 --> 00:22:30,206
the last dragons
were no larger than cats.

222
00:22:30,325 --> 00:22:33,243
They must be unchained
or they'll waste away.

223
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,796
Missandei,

224
00:22:36,882 --> 00:22:40,417
how many times were you in the
company of these dragons?

225
00:22:40,502 --> 00:22:44,170
- Many times.
- And did they ever harm you?

226
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:46,306
Never.

227
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:48,558
Dragons are intelligent.

228
00:22:48,677 --> 00:22:51,511
More intelligent than men
according to some maesters.

229
00:22:51,596 --> 00:22:53,930
They have affection for their friends

230
00:22:54,015 --> 00:22:55,849
and fury for their enemies.

231
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:00,019
- I am their friend.
- Do they know that?

232
00:23:00,155 --> 00:23:03,189
They will. It's time
they had their supper.

233
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:36,499
I'm friends with your mother.

234
00:24:43,341 --> 00:24:45,959
I'm here to help.

235
00:24:46,094 --> 00:24:48,127
Don't eat the help.

236
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:54,300
When I was a child,

237
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:58,054
an uncle asked what gift
I wanted for my name day.

238
00:24:58,139 --> 00:25:00,773
I begged him for one of you.

239
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:04,360
"It wouldn't even have to be
a big dragon," I told him.

240
00:25:06,231 --> 00:25:08,448
"It could be little
like me."

241
00:25:15,156 --> 00:25:19,292
Everyone laughed like it was the
funniest thing they had ever heard.

242
00:25:20,629 --> 00:25:22,829
Then my father told me

243
00:25:22,914 --> 00:25:26,833
the last dragon had died
a century ago.

244
00:25:26,968 --> 00:25:30,053
I cried myself to sleep that night.

245
00:25:39,097 --> 00:25:41,064
But here you are.

246
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:51,217
Next time I have an idea like that,

247
00:26:51,303 --> 00:26:53,086
punch me in the face.

248
00:27:07,102 --> 00:27:08,935
What's your name?

249
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,443
What's your name?

250
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:20,947
- No one.
- I don't believe that.

251
00:27:21,032 --> 00:27:23,783
You don't believe that.

252
00:27:54,816 --> 00:27:57,200
Who are you?

253
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,820
No one.

254
00:27:59,954 --> 00:28:02,321
If a girl says her name,

255
00:28:02,457 --> 00:28:05,458
a man will let her sleep
under a roof tonight.

256
00:28:05,543 --> 00:28:07,827
A girl has no name.

257
00:28:07,962 --> 00:28:10,163
If a girl says her name,

258
00:28:10,298 --> 00:28:12,331
a man will feed her tonight.

259
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:14,884
A girl has no name.

260
00:28:16,254 --> 00:28:17,970
If a girl says her name,

261
00:28:18,056 --> 00:28:20,390
a man will give her eyes back.

262
00:28:22,143 --> 00:28:24,394
A girl has no name.

263
00:28:31,986 --> 00:28:34,103
Come.

264
00:28:42,447 --> 00:28:44,363
Leave it.

265
00:28:44,449 --> 00:28:47,533
<i>A girl is not a beggar anymore.</i>

266
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,795
We came upon the bodies
on our way here.

267
00:29:00,215 --> 00:29:03,382
Half a dozen men?
Your best hunters?

268
00:29:03,518 --> 00:29:05,184
They obviously had help.

269
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:08,187
I didn't think Lady Sansa
killed them all by herself.

270
00:29:09,441 --> 00:29:11,724
Thank you for this report,
Lord Karstark.

271
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,227
We know where she's going.

272
00:29:14,312 --> 00:29:16,062
Her brother's at Castle Black.

273
00:29:16,147 --> 00:29:17,864
Ned Stark's last surviving son?

274
00:29:17,949 --> 00:29:20,032
Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.

275
00:29:20,118 --> 00:29:23,202
So was I, Father.

276
00:29:23,288 --> 00:29:25,371
Your hold on the North
will never be secure

277
00:29:25,457 --> 00:29:27,740
as long as a Stark
can walk through that door.

278
00:29:27,826 --> 00:29:30,409
Castle Black isn't defended
on the southern side.

279
00:29:30,545 --> 00:29:34,413
And the few men left are barely men at all.
Farm boys and thieves.

280
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:38,417
With a small force, we could storm
the castle, kill Jon Snow--

281
00:29:38,553 --> 00:29:41,471
Murder the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

282
00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:44,257
You'd unite every house
in the North against us.

283
00:29:45,977 --> 00:29:48,010
We don't need
every house in the North.

284
00:29:48,096 --> 00:29:50,730
<i>The Umbers, the Manderlys,
and the Karstarks</i>

285
00:29:50,815 --> 00:29:54,684
command more soldiers than all
the other houses combined.

286
00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:57,737
With their support,
none could challenge us.

287
00:29:57,822 --> 00:30:01,824
The Starks lost my house the day
King Robb cut off my father's head.

288
00:30:01,943 --> 00:30:04,911
It's time for new blood in the North.

289
00:30:13,955 --> 00:30:16,706
If you acquire a
reputation as a mad dog,

290
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:18,624
you'll be treated as a mad dog.

291
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,594
Taken out back and
slaughtered for pig feed.

292
00:30:22,964 --> 00:30:24,847
<i>My lords.</i>

293
00:30:24,966 --> 00:30:27,300
<i>Lady Walda has given birth.</i>

294
00:30:27,435 --> 00:30:29,385
A boy.

295
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,971
<i>Red-cheeked
and healthy.</i>

296
00:30:32,106 --> 00:30:35,308
My congratulations, Lord Bolton.

297
00:30:44,536 --> 00:30:46,402
Congratulations, Father.

298
00:30:47,906 --> 00:30:50,656
I look forward to meeting
my new brother.

299
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:57,547
You'll always be my firstborn.

300
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,300
Thank you for saying that.

301
00:31:01,386 --> 00:31:03,636
It means a great deal to me.

302
00:31:40,124 --> 00:31:42,375
Maester Wolkan,

303
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:46,345
<i>send ravens to all the northern houses.
Roose Bolton is dead.</i>

304
00:31:48,016 --> 00:31:50,182
Poisoned by our enemies.

305
00:31:56,557 --> 00:31:58,557
How did he die?

306
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,897
Poisoned by his enemies.

307
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:07,900
You're talking to your lord.
Use respect.

308
00:32:09,404 --> 00:32:11,153
Forgive me, my lord.

309
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:16,375
Send for Lady Walda and the baby.

310
00:32:17,962 --> 00:32:19,962
She's resting, my lord.

311
00:32:23,334 --> 00:32:25,384
At once, my lord.

312
00:32:50,361 --> 00:32:52,244
There he is.

313
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,280
Isn't he wonderful?

314
00:32:57,952 --> 00:32:59,752
May I hold him?

315
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:03,172
Of-- of course.

316
00:33:13,217 --> 00:33:15,184
Little brother.

317
00:33:16,304 --> 00:33:18,220
Lord Bolton sent for us.

318
00:33:18,306 --> 00:33:19,972
Have you seen him?

319
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:31,734
Of course.
Follow me, Mother.

320
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,170
Where is Lord Bolton?

321
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:03,182
Down!

322
00:34:03,317 --> 00:34:06,185
<i>It's all right. Come on, shh.</i>

323
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,739
<i>It's cold out here, Ramsay.
I need to feed him.</i>

324
00:34:15,863 --> 00:34:18,998
Ramsay, where is your father?

325
00:34:20,334 --> 00:34:22,001
Ramsay.

326
00:34:29,794 --> 00:34:32,011
Where is Lord Bolton?

327
00:34:38,553 --> 00:34:40,603
I am Lord Bolton.

328
00:34:50,481 --> 00:34:52,615
Ramsay.

329
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:54,400
Ramsay, please.

330
00:34:54,535 --> 00:34:57,119
I'll leave Winterfell.
I'll go back to the Riverlands.

331
00:35:02,577 --> 00:35:04,493
Please.

332
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:06,579
Ramsay.

333
00:35:08,466 --> 00:35:10,299
He's your brother.

334
00:35:13,254 --> 00:35:15,754
I prefer being an only child.

335
00:35:36,077 --> 00:35:38,944
<i>I saw her with a man.</i>

336
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,913
I don't think he hurt her.

337
00:35:40,998 --> 00:35:44,116
She didn't want to leave him,
he didn't want to leave her.

338
00:35:46,254 --> 00:35:48,087
You don't know which way she went?

339
00:35:48,172 --> 00:35:50,456
I spent three days looking for her.

340
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:52,007
She disappeared.

341
00:35:54,378 --> 00:35:55,845
How'd she look?

342
00:35:55,963 --> 00:35:58,130
She looked good.

343
00:35:58,216 --> 00:36:01,183
She wasn't exactly
dressed like a lady.

344
00:36:02,603 --> 00:36:04,220
No, she wouldn't be.

345
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,307
What happened at Winterfell?

346
00:36:19,987 --> 00:36:23,572
I should have gone with you
while I had the chance.

347
00:36:23,658 --> 00:36:26,625
It was a difficult choice, my lady.

348
00:36:30,998 --> 00:36:34,383
We've all had to make
difficult choices.

349
00:36:53,938 --> 00:36:56,155
We shouldn't be lighting fires.

350
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,323
It's not safe.

351
00:36:57,408 --> 00:36:58,741
He won't stop hunting us.

352
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:00,526
We just have to make it
to Castle Black.

353
00:37:00,611 --> 00:37:03,078
Once we're with Jon, Ramsay
won't be able to touch us.

354
00:37:03,197 --> 00:37:06,031
Jon will have me killed the
moment I step through the gate.

355
00:37:06,117 --> 00:37:07,783
I won't let him.

356
00:37:07,868 --> 00:37:09,868
I'll tell him the truth
about Bran and Rickon.

357
00:37:11,672 --> 00:37:14,873
And the truth about the farm
boys I killed in their place.

358
00:37:15,009 --> 00:37:18,677
And the truth about
Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded.

359
00:37:20,765 --> 00:37:23,682
And the truth about Robb,
who I betrayed.

360
00:37:25,303 --> 00:37:28,137
When you take the black,
all your crimes are forgiven.

361
00:37:28,222 --> 00:37:30,055
I don't want to be forgiven.

362
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,560
I can never make
amends to your family

363
00:37:34,695 --> 00:37:36,145
for the things I've done.

364
00:37:38,115 --> 00:37:40,532
They'll keep you safer
than I ever could.

365
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:47,873
You're not coming with us?

366
00:37:50,044 --> 00:37:53,329
I would have taken you
all the way to the Wall.

367
00:37:54,665 --> 00:37:56,415
I would have died to get you there.

368
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:15,651
May I take one of the horses?

369
00:38:19,106 --> 00:38:21,407
Where will you go?

370
00:38:24,111 --> 00:38:26,078
Home.

371
00:38:34,672 --> 00:38:38,791
<i>The Glovers have
retaken Deepwood Motte.</i>

372
00:38:38,926 --> 00:38:41,126
And the ironborn who held it?

373
00:38:41,262 --> 00:38:44,463
They died fighting to a man.

374
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,267
What is dead may never die.

375
00:38:48,352 --> 00:38:50,552
What is dead may never die.

376
00:38:50,638 --> 00:38:52,638
But they did

377
00:38:52,773 --> 00:38:55,441
and our invasion died with them.

378
00:38:55,526 --> 00:38:58,644
Deepwood Motte was our last
stronghold on the mainland.

379
00:38:58,779 --> 00:39:00,396
Then we will take more.

380
00:39:00,481 --> 00:39:03,732
Why? For more pinecones and rocks?

381
00:39:05,903 --> 00:39:08,320
Because I order it.

382
00:39:08,456 --> 00:39:10,456
We can defeat anyone at sea,

383
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:12,741
but we'll never hold
lands and castles

384
00:39:12,827 --> 00:39:14,326
against mainland armies.

385
00:39:14,412 --> 00:39:16,662
Not if our captains defy my orders,

386
00:39:16,797 --> 00:39:21,216
abandon their posts, and sacrifice
our men on foolish missions.

387
00:39:21,335 --> 00:39:23,302
I won't apologize
for trying to rescue Theon.

388
00:39:23,387 --> 00:39:24,503
Then where is he?

389
00:39:24,588 --> 00:39:27,056
Where is your kingdom?

390
00:39:27,174 --> 00:39:31,176
We took those castles because the
northerners marched off to war.

391
00:39:31,262 --> 00:39:33,345
That war is over.

392
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:35,180
The last time
we provoked them too far,

393
00:39:35,316 --> 00:39:37,983
I watched from that window
as they breached our walls

394
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:40,018
<i>and knocked down our towers.</i>

395
00:39:40,154 --> 00:39:41,937
<i>I lost two brothers that day.</i>

396
00:39:42,022 --> 00:39:44,656
And I lost three sons.

397
00:39:45,993 --> 00:39:47,943
The War of the Five
Kings, they call it.

398
00:39:48,028 --> 00:39:49,945
Well, the other four are dead.

399
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:53,282
When you rule the Iron Islands, you
can wage all the peace you want.

400
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:55,200
But for now, shut your mouth and obey

401
00:39:55,336 --> 00:39:58,003
or I will make another heir who will.

402
00:40:36,794 --> 00:40:38,627
Let me pass.

403
00:40:41,081 --> 00:40:44,416
You fool, move aside for your king.

404
00:40:45,469 --> 00:40:47,386
Haven't I always, brother?

405
00:40:57,231 --> 00:41:01,600
I thought you'd be rotting
under some foreign sea by now.

406
00:41:01,685 --> 00:41:05,070
What is dead may never die.

407
00:41:07,274 --> 00:41:10,242
Has the custom changed
since I've been gone?

408
00:41:10,327 --> 00:41:12,578
Aren't you supposed
to repeat the words?

409
00:41:12,663 --> 00:41:15,747
You can mock our god without my help.

410
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:18,617
I don't mock the Drowned God.

411
00:41:18,702 --> 00:41:21,587
I am the Drowned God.

412
00:41:21,672 --> 00:41:23,539
From Oldtown to Qarth,

413
00:41:23,624 --> 00:41:27,209
when men see my sails, they pray.

414
00:41:36,103 --> 00:41:39,521
You're old, brother.

415
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,473
<i>You've had your time.</i>

416
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:43,859
Now let another rule.

417
00:41:43,978 --> 00:41:47,145
I heard you lost your mind

418
00:41:47,231 --> 00:41:50,315
during a storm on the Jade Sea.

419
00:41:50,401 --> 00:41:55,787
They tied you to the mast to
keep you from jumping overboard.

420
00:41:55,873 --> 00:41:57,406
They did.

421
00:41:57,491 --> 00:42:02,077
And when the storm passed,
you cut out their tongues.

422
00:42:02,162 --> 00:42:04,079
I needed silence.

423
00:42:05,382 --> 00:42:07,633
What kind of an ironborn

424
00:42:07,718 --> 00:42:11,637
loses his senses during a storm?

425
00:42:11,722 --> 00:42:15,591
I am the storm, brother.

426
00:42:15,676 --> 00:42:17,976
The first storm and the last.

427
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,513
And you're in my way.

428
00:42:59,553 --> 00:43:04,022
Lord, take your servant Balon
back beneath the waves.

429
00:43:04,108 --> 00:43:07,442
Feed the creatures of your
kingdom on his flesh.

430
00:43:07,561 --> 00:43:09,561
Pull his bones down to your depths

431
00:43:09,697 --> 00:43:12,447
to rest beside his ancestors
and his children.

432
00:43:12,566 --> 00:43:14,866
What is dead may never die.

433
00:43:24,044 --> 00:43:26,578
I'm going to find out who did this.

434
00:43:26,664 --> 00:43:29,748
I'm going to feed them to
the sharks while they live.

435
00:43:31,418 --> 00:43:34,219
I swear it by the Salt Throne.

436
00:43:34,305 --> 00:43:37,139
The Salt Throne is not
yours to swear upon,

437
00:43:37,257 --> 00:43:39,308
not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.

438
00:43:39,426 --> 00:43:41,259
My father would have
wanted me to rule.

439
00:43:41,395 --> 00:43:44,646
Your father does not get to choose.
The law is clear.

440
00:43:46,934 --> 00:43:49,101
Perhaps you'll win.

441
00:43:49,186 --> 00:43:52,404
Perhaps you'll be the first woman
in history to rule the ironborn.

442
00:43:53,691 --> 00:43:55,440
And perhaps not.

443
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:14,042
Come in.

444
00:44:20,134 --> 00:44:23,802
I'm sorry, my lady.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

445
00:44:23,937 --> 00:44:26,021
You interrupt nothing.

446
00:44:37,735 --> 00:44:40,869
I assume you know why I'm here.

447
00:44:42,156 --> 00:44:43,655
I will after you tell me.

448
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:45,991
It's about the Lord Commander.

449
00:44:46,076 --> 00:44:48,243
The former Lord Commander.

450
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,380
Does he have to be?

451
00:44:54,835 --> 00:44:57,085
What are you asking?

452
00:45:01,008 --> 00:45:04,810
Do you know of any magic...

453
00:45:06,513 --> 00:45:08,146
that could help him?

454
00:45:08,232 --> 00:45:09,598
Bring him back?

455
00:45:09,683 --> 00:45:12,317
If you want to help him,
leave him be.

456
00:45:12,403 --> 00:45:14,569
Can it be done?

457
00:45:14,688 --> 00:45:17,239
There are some with this power.

458
00:45:17,357 --> 00:45:19,908
- <i>How?</i>
- I don't know.

459
00:45:20,027 --> 00:45:21,076
Have you seen it done?

460
00:45:24,331 --> 00:45:26,782
I met a man who came
back from the dead,

461
00:45:26,867 --> 00:45:30,001
but the priest
who did it--

462
00:45:30,087 --> 00:45:32,003
it shouldn't have been possible.

463
00:45:32,089 --> 00:45:35,257
But it was.
It could be now.

464
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:37,676
Not for me.

465
00:45:41,849 --> 00:45:43,882
Not for you?

466
00:45:47,554 --> 00:45:51,223
I saw you drink poison that
should have killed you.

467
00:45:51,308 --> 00:45:54,392
I saw you give birth
to a demon made of shadows.

468
00:45:54,528 --> 00:45:57,112
Everything I believed,

469
00:45:57,231 --> 00:46:00,649
the great victory
I saw in the flames,

470
00:46:00,734 --> 00:46:02,317
all of it was a lie.

471
00:46:06,707 --> 00:46:08,657
You were right all along.

472
00:46:08,742 --> 00:46:11,493
The Lord never spoke to me.

473
00:46:11,578 --> 00:46:13,545
Fuck him, then.

474
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:15,547
Fuck all of them.

475
00:46:17,301 --> 00:46:20,969
I'm not a devout man, obviously.

476
00:46:21,088 --> 00:46:24,422
Seven gods, drowned gods,
tree gods, it's all the same.

477
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:30,262
I'm not asking the Lord
of Light for help.

478
00:46:30,397 --> 00:46:34,900
I'm asking the woman who
showed me that miracles exist.

479
00:46:36,854 --> 00:46:39,070
I never had this gift.

480
00:46:39,156 --> 00:46:41,106
Have you ever tried?

481
00:50:24,131 --> 00:50:26,631
Please.
