00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:02,400
It's got to be the Mountain.
He's the biggest.

6
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:04,802
- He's the strongest.
- Bulls are bigger than lions.

7
00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:06,704
Doesn't mean I'd pick
a bull in a fight.

8
00:02:06,738 --> 00:02:09,840
If the bull had fangs
and claws, I would.

9
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:13,577
Right, the Mountain
or our man Jaime.

10
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:16,113
If he ever gets out.

11
00:02:16,148 --> 00:02:17,748
Loras Tyrell?

12
00:02:17,783 --> 00:02:20,952
Loras Tyrell.
He's prettier than the queen.

13
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:22,527
I don't care about pretty.

14
00:02:22,552 --> 00:02:24,022
He's better with a sword
than any of them.

15
00:02:24,024 --> 00:02:26,325
How good could he be?

16
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:28,794
He's been stabbing
Renly Baratheon for years,

17
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:31,397
and Renly ain't dead.

18
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:42,175
The horses seem
a little spooked to you?

19
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:44,110
They're horses.

20
00:02:44,145 --> 00:02:46,246
They get spooked
by their own shadows.

21
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,383
Shh.

22
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:52,485
Do you hear that?

23
00:02:53,621 --> 00:02:55,321
No.

24
00:02:55,356 --> 00:02:57,057
There's something
out there.

25
00:03:19,814 --> 00:03:22,616
Oh.

26
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:25,052
Oh, you're a right
little prick.

27
00:03:25,086 --> 00:03:26,754
You should see
your face.

28
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:29,190
I swear you
pissed yourself.

29
00:03:29,224 --> 00:03:31,258
"Oh, who goes there?
Ahh!"

30
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:33,193
There is something out there.

31
00:03:33,228 --> 00:03:35,596
Yeah, don't even try me.

32
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,865
- Rennick.
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

33
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,501
Rennick!

34
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,978
<i>- King in the North!</i>
<i>- The King in the North!</i>

35
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:13,733
<i>Five Lannisters dead</i>
<i>for every one of ours.</i>

36
00:04:13,768 --> 00:04:15,302
They're dead.
Take everything they've got.

37
00:04:15,336 --> 00:04:17,470
<i>We've nowhere to keep</i>
<i>all these prisoners.</i>

38
00:04:17,505 --> 00:04:20,006
Barely enough food
to feed our own.

39
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,141
We're not executing
prisoners, Lord Bolton.

40
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:23,742
Of course, Your Grace.

41
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:26,545
The officers
will be useful.

42
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:29,714
Some of them may be privy
to Tywin Lannister's plans.

43
00:04:29,748 --> 00:04:31,483
I doubt it.

44
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:33,418
<i>Well, we'll learn</i>
<i>soon enough.</i>

45
00:04:33,453 --> 00:04:37,356
In my family we say,
"A naked man has few secrets.

46
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:39,292
A flayed man none."

47
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:41,294
My father outlawed
flaying in the North.

48
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:44,531
- We're not in the North.
- We're not torturing them.

49
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:46,500
The high road's very pretty,

50
00:04:46,534 --> 00:04:49,302
but you'll have a hard time
marching your army down it.

51
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,105
The Lannisters hold
prisoners of their own.

52
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,308
I won't give them an excuse
to abuse my sisters.

53
00:04:55,343 --> 00:04:57,444
<i>No, no, don't! Don't!</i>

54
00:04:57,478 --> 00:04:59,179
<i>- Shh, shh.</i>
<i>- Please!</i>

55
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:01,814
Shh.

56
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,450
The rot's set in.

57
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:07,953
No, don't!
No, don't!

58
00:05:07,987 --> 00:05:10,689
- Shh.
- Please, don't!

59
00:05:10,723 --> 00:05:12,757
It'll get better.
It doesn't even hurt.

60
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:15,928
The rot will spread.
If we don't take the foot now--

61
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:18,096
No, you can't!

62
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:22,834
Ser! Please, Ser.

63
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:24,670
- I can't lose--
- You'll die if she does it.

64
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:26,539
I don't want to be
a cripple, please.

65
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:29,808
Surely one of our men needs your
attention more than this cub.

66
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:31,677
Your men are not
my men, My Lord.

67
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:34,613
Put this in your mouth and lie down.
You don't want to watch.

68
00:05:34,647 --> 00:05:37,516
- No! You can't!
- Bite on it.

69
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,585
It's better than biting
your own tongue, believe me.

70
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:16,656
- What's your name?
- Talisa.

71
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:18,692
<i>Your last name?</i>

72
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:20,961
You want to know what side
my family fights on?

73
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:23,429
You know my family name.
You have me at a disadvantage.

74
00:06:23,464 --> 00:06:26,265
That boy lost his foot
on your orders.

75
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,401
They killed my father.

76
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:31,270
- That boy did?
- The family he fights for.

77
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:34,306
Do you think he's friends
with King Joffrey?

78
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,875
<i>He's a fisherman's son</i>
<i>that grew up near Lannisport.</i>

79
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,125
He probably never held a spear

80
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,040
before they shoved one in his
hands a few months ago.

81
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:42,281
I have no hatred
for the lad.

82
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,884
That should help
his foot grow back.

83
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:52,524
You'd have us surrender,
end all this bloodshed.

84
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:55,861
I understand.
The country would be at peace

85
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:57,834
and life would be just
under the righteous hand

86
00:06:57,859 --> 00:06:59,159
of good King Joffrey.

87
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,901
- You're going to kill Joffrey?
- If the Gods give me strength.

88
00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:05,372
- And then what?
- I don't know.

89
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:07,341
We'll go back
to Winterfell.

90
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,376
I have no desire to sit
on the Iron Throne.

91
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,012
So who will?

92
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:14,080
I don't know.

93
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:16,050
You're fighting
to overthrow a king,

94
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:17,852
and yet you have no plan
for what comes after?

95
00:07:17,886 --> 00:07:20,487
First we have
to win the war.

96
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:27,694
You never told me
where you're from.

97
00:07:27,728 --> 00:07:30,096
- Volantis.
- Volantis?

98
00:07:30,131 --> 00:07:32,866
You're far from home.

99
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,168
The boy was lucky
you were here.

100
00:07:35,202 --> 00:07:38,270
He was unlucky
that you were.

101
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,180
You're here to answer for your
brother's latest treasons.

102
00:07:49,214 --> 00:07:50,915
Your Grace,

103
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:54,251
whatever my traitor brother
has done, I had no part.

104
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:55,753
You know that.
I beg you--

105
00:07:55,787 --> 00:07:57,822
Ser Lancel, tell her
of this outrage.

106
00:07:57,856 --> 00:08:00,124
<i>Using some vile sorcery,</i>

107
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:02,693
your brother fell on Stafford Lannister
with an army of wolves.

108
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:05,729
Thousands of good men
were butchered.

109
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,268
After the slaughter,
the northmen feasted on

110
00:08:08,293 --> 00:08:09,975
the flesh of the slain.

111
00:08:12,037 --> 00:08:14,573
Killing you would send
your brother a message.

112
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:20,613
But my mother insists
on keeping you alive.

113
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:22,415
Stand.

114
00:08:24,018 --> 00:08:25,810
So we'll have to send
your brother

115
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:27,835
a message some other way.

116
00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:31,191
Meryn.

117
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:36,829
Leave her face.

118
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:38,397
I like her pretty.

119
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:47,787
Meryn, My Lady
is overdressed.

120
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:50,409
Unburden her.

121
00:08:55,716 --> 00:08:57,917
If you want Robb Stark
to hear us,

122
00:08:57,952 --> 00:09:00,087
we're going to have
to speak louder.

123
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:04,125
<i>What is the meaning</i>
<i>of this?</i>

124
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:15,002
What kind of knight
beats a helpless girl?

125
00:09:15,036 --> 00:09:17,204
The kind who serves
his king, Imp.

126
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:18,672
Careful, now. We don't want

127
00:09:18,697 --> 00:09:20,507
to get blood all over your
pretty white cloak.

128
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:23,610
Someone get the girl something
to cover herself with.

129
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:25,845
She is to be your queen.

130
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,713
Have you no regard
for her honor?

131
00:09:27,748 --> 00:09:29,915
<i>- I'm punishing her.</i>
<i>- For what crimes?</i>

132
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,218
<i>She did not fight her</i>
<i>brother's battle, you half-wit.</i>

133
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:35,821
You can't talk to me like that.
The king can do as he likes!

134
00:09:35,856 --> 00:09:37,723
The Mad King
did as he liked.

135
00:09:37,758 --> 00:09:41,194
Has your Uncle Jaime ever told
you what happened to him?

136
00:09:41,229 --> 00:09:44,164
No one threatens His Grace
in the presence of the Kingsguard.

137
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:46,234
I'm not threatening
the King, Ser.

138
00:09:46,268 --> 00:09:47,835
I am educating my nephew.

139
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,206
Bronn, the next time
Ser Meryn speaks, kill him.

140
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:55,577
That was a threat.
See the difference?

141
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:20,870
<i>I apologize for</i>
<i>my nephew's behavior.</i>

142
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,836
Tell me the truth.

143
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:25,861
Do you want an end
to this engagement?

144
00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:29,881
I am loyal to King Joffrey,
my one true love.

145
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:38,222
Lady Stark, you may
survive us yet.

146
00:10:41,926 --> 00:10:43,660
The little king's
backed up.

147
00:10:43,694 --> 00:10:47,063
Clogged from balls
to brains.

148
00:10:47,098 --> 00:10:49,799
You think dipping his wick
will cure what ails him?

149
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:52,802
There's no cure
for being a cunt.

150
00:10:52,836 --> 00:10:55,104
But the boy's at that age.

151
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:58,841
And he's got nothing to do all
day but pick wings off flies.

152
00:10:58,876 --> 00:11:01,411
Couldn't hurt to get
some of the poison out.

153
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,154
What are you
doing here, dog?

154
00:11:11,189 --> 00:11:13,523
Your uncle left
your nameday present

155
00:11:13,558 --> 00:11:16,025
and asked me to see
that you got it.

156
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:20,597
And?

157
00:11:20,631 --> 00:11:22,732
What is it?

158
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,202
Look inside,
Your Grace.

159
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:34,044
Your Grace.

160
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:36,948
- Happy nameday, Your Grace.
- My nameday has passed.

161
00:11:36,982 --> 00:11:39,784
We won't tell
if you won't.

162
00:11:42,922 --> 00:11:45,057
No.

163
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:46,859
Her.

164
00:11:49,263 --> 00:11:51,264
Touch her.

165
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:14,619
Could you hit her?

166
00:12:27,868 --> 00:12:29,536
My uncle sent you?

167
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,705
Yes, Your Grace.

168
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,074
He chose us himself.

169
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:34,875
Hmm.

170
00:12:43,685 --> 00:12:45,954
Use this.

171
00:12:58,534 --> 00:13:00,168
Harder.

172
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:08,676
I said harder.

173
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:13,214
He'd want me to get
his money's worth.

174
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:59,627
Your Grace, too much pain
will spoil the pleasure.

175
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,431
<i>Please, please,</i>

176
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:10,303
please, Your Grace.

177
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:14,373
Your Grace,
if your uncle finds out--

178
00:14:14,407 --> 00:14:16,242
Oh, I want him
to find out.

179
00:14:16,276 --> 00:14:19,545
You will bring her to his
chambers when you're finished

180
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:21,780
and show him
what you've done.

181
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,984
Or the same thing
will happen to you.

182
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:34,259
Begin.

183
00:14:42,603 --> 00:14:44,004
Harder!

184
00:14:55,148 --> 00:14:58,751
Well, if it isn't
my favorite whoremonger.

185
00:14:58,786 --> 00:15:01,687
Pray I haven't kept
you waiting long.

186
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,924
Your Grace.

187
00:15:09,262 --> 00:15:12,564
Now you do the Lannisters'
bidding, is that it?

188
00:15:12,598 --> 00:15:15,800
Tell me, was my brother's
body even cold

189
00:15:15,835 --> 00:15:18,002
before you secured
your newest patron?

190
00:15:18,037 --> 00:15:20,405
I'm a practical man.

191
00:15:21,707 --> 00:15:23,708
Just not a loyal one.

192
00:15:23,742 --> 00:15:25,677
<i>And who would you have</i>
<i>me be loyal to?</i>

193
00:15:25,711 --> 00:15:27,645
Your brother's corpse?

194
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:32,849
I don't like you,
Lord Baelish.

195
00:15:32,884 --> 00:15:35,218
I don't like your face.

196
00:15:35,253 --> 00:15:38,655
I don't like the words that come
oozing out of your mouth.

197
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:42,259
I don't want you in my tent
one minute more than necessary.

198
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:45,495
So tell me,
why are you here?

199
00:15:46,497 --> 00:15:48,499
<i>You can trust Brienne.</i>

200
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:51,034
Her loyalty comes
without charge.

201
00:15:53,504 --> 00:15:56,239
You still have many friends
at court, Your Grace,

202
00:15:56,274 --> 00:15:59,677
many who believe
Ned Stark erred

203
00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:01,846
by not supporting
your claim.

204
00:16:03,282 --> 00:16:06,017
Now I understand.

205
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:07,953
You know I have
the numbers.

206
00:16:07,987 --> 00:16:10,756
You know I'm marching
on King's Landing.

207
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,958
When I take the throne,
you hope to retain your position.

208
00:16:15,461 --> 00:16:17,395
And your head.

209
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:20,397
I would give priority
to my head.

210
00:16:20,431 --> 00:16:22,899
<i>I understand that</i>
<i>you don't like me,</i>

211
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:25,268
and while that
saddens me greatly,

212
00:16:25,302 --> 00:16:27,937
I did not come here today
seeking your affection.

213
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,473
<i>When you march</i>
<i>on King's Landing,</i>

214
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:34,910
you may find yourself facing
a protracted siege or...

215
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:38,147
open gates.

216
00:16:55,832 --> 00:16:57,566
Your Grace.

217
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:00,536
Lord Baelish.

218
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,706
All of these tents
look the same to me.

219
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,075
- Would you be so kind--
- It would be my pleasure.

220
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,944
It took me weeks to learn
way around the camp.

221
00:17:08,979 --> 00:17:12,014
Twice I walked in on officers
in stages of undress.

222
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:14,717
And the moment I learn
which tent is mine,

223
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,453
we're on the move again.

224
00:17:16,487 --> 00:17:18,120
Your tent?

225
00:17:18,155 --> 00:17:20,290
Not our tent?

226
00:17:20,324 --> 00:17:22,692
The King snores, perhaps?

227
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:25,829
Or simply prefers
solitude?

228
00:17:25,863 --> 00:17:28,733
Pressures of command,
no doubt.

229
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:31,469
Four kings vying
for the throne.

230
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:33,871
I am not tutored
in warfare,

231
00:17:33,906 --> 00:17:37,575
but basic arithmetic favors the
side with the greater numbers.

232
00:17:37,577 --> 00:17:39,214
If war were arithmetic,

233
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:41,393
the mathematicians
would rule the world.

234
00:17:42,781 --> 00:17:45,717
But I did notice your brother
entering His Grace's tent the just now.

235
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:47,952
The place of a Kingsguard
is by the King's side.

236
00:17:47,987 --> 00:17:50,021
And on the night
of the your wedding,

237
00:17:50,056 --> 00:17:52,791
who was by
the King's side then?

238
00:17:52,825 --> 00:17:55,027
You seem quite interested
in our marriage.

239
00:17:55,061 --> 00:17:57,630
Your marriage
is quite interesting...

240
00:17:57,664 --> 00:18:00,767
Not only to me,
but to the realm.

241
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:03,904
The marriage of a wealthy girl
always breeds interest,

242
00:18:03,938 --> 00:18:06,073
if nothing else.

243
00:18:06,107 --> 00:18:08,008
You've never married,
have you?

244
00:18:08,043 --> 00:18:12,413
I've been unlucky
in my affections, sadly.

245
00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:14,849
That is sad.

246
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:16,650
Though perhaps
it's for the best.

247
00:18:16,684 --> 00:18:18,952
The whole notion of marriage
seems to confuse you,

248
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:21,188
so allow me to explain.

249
00:18:21,222 --> 00:18:25,659
My husband is my King,
and my King is my husband.

250
00:18:25,693 --> 00:18:29,229
Here is your tent,
Lord Baelish. Good night.

251
00:19:24,186 --> 00:19:26,622
What do you know
of this place?

252
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:28,791
Only that the desert
around their walls

253
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:30,960
is called
the Garden of Bones.

254
00:19:32,663 --> 00:19:35,564
Every time the Qartheen
shut their gates on a traveler,

255
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:37,833
the garden grows.

256
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:53,180
- Go on!
- You, keep moving!

257
00:20:00,155 --> 00:20:02,824
<i>Bring her about!</i>

258
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:05,827
What kind of fire
melts stone?

259
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:07,762
Dragon fire.

260
00:20:07,797 --> 00:20:09,531
There's dragons here?

261
00:20:09,565 --> 00:20:12,167
No, all the dragons
are dead.

262
00:20:12,202 --> 00:20:14,403
What's that smell?

263
00:20:16,073 --> 00:20:18,808
Dead people.

264
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,978
Move.

265
00:20:29,255 --> 00:20:31,089
<i>Please, please, no, no!</i>

266
00:20:37,796 --> 00:20:40,832
<i>No.</i>

267
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:53,344
<i>He's dead.</i>

268
00:20:53,379 --> 00:20:56,547
He was my son.

269
00:20:58,417 --> 00:21:01,819
My sister
was three days ago.

270
00:21:01,854 --> 00:21:04,922
My husband,
the day before that.

271
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:08,192
They take someone
every day?

272
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:12,597
Does anyone live?

273
00:21:36,055 --> 00:21:38,523
Joffrey.

274
00:21:38,557 --> 00:21:40,524
Cersei.

275
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:42,326
Ilyn Payne.

276
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,261
The Hound.

277
00:21:44,295 --> 00:21:46,663
Joffrey.

278
00:21:46,697 --> 00:21:49,365
Cersei.

279
00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:51,334
Ilyn Payne.

280
00:21:51,368 --> 00:21:53,102
The Hound.

281
00:21:53,136 --> 00:21:56,338
Joffrey. Cersei.

282
00:21:56,373 --> 00:21:59,408
Ilyn Payne.
The Hound.

283
00:22:03,513 --> 00:22:04,980
How dare you?

284
00:22:05,015 --> 00:22:06,882
You may have heard
false reports.

285
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:09,419
- You betrayed Ned.
- <i>Betrayed?</i>

286
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,387
I wanted him to serve
as Protector of the Realm.

287
00:22:11,422 --> 00:22:12,956
I begged him
to seize the moment.

288
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:17,094
I trusted you.
My husband trusted you.

289
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:20,397
And you repaid our faith
with treachery.

290
00:22:20,431 --> 00:22:21,732
- No, My Lady.
- Get out!

291
00:22:21,766 --> 00:22:23,935
Cat, I've--

292
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:26,604
I've loved you
since I was a boy.

293
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:30,542
It seems to me that fate
has given us this chance--

294
00:22:30,577 --> 00:22:33,978
Have you lost your mind?
Get out!

295
00:22:47,257 --> 00:22:49,592
Do you want to see
your girls again?

296
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:55,431
Sansa, more beautiful
than ever.

297
00:22:55,466 --> 00:22:59,503
And Arya,
just as wild as ever.

298
00:22:59,537 --> 00:23:01,739
You have Arya, too?

299
00:23:01,773 --> 00:23:05,843
Both girls are healthy
and safe...

300
00:23:05,878 --> 00:23:08,880
<i>for now.</i>

301
00:23:08,914 --> 00:23:12,717
But you know the Queen
and you know Joffrey.

302
00:23:12,752 --> 00:23:15,686
I fear for
their longevity

303
00:23:15,721 --> 00:23:17,922
if they remain
in the capital.

304
00:23:39,511 --> 00:23:41,178
What do you want?

305
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:45,851
The Lannisters will trade your
daughters for the Kingslayer.

306
00:23:45,885 --> 00:23:47,452
Of course they will.

307
00:23:47,487 --> 00:23:50,156
Jaime Lannister
for two girls?

308
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,758
Robb will never agree
to those terms.

309
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:54,094
I'm not bringing
these terms to him.

310
00:23:54,128 --> 00:23:55,995
I'm bringing them
to you.

311
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,631
You think I'd keep
secrets from my son?

312
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:01,568
Robb has surprised them all
with his skills in battle,

313
00:24:01,602 --> 00:24:03,536
but he's not a mother.

314
00:24:03,571 --> 00:24:06,405
<i>Consider it, Cat.</i>

315
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,175
<i>You may not get</i>
<i>another chance.</i>

316
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,115
- I've brought you a gift.
- I don't want your gifts.

317
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:19,452
A token of Tyrion
Lannister's goodwill.

318
00:24:19,486 --> 00:24:23,623
He wants you to understand
that this exchange of prisoners

319
00:24:23,657 --> 00:24:25,759
is offered in good faith.

320
00:24:25,793 --> 00:24:27,727
Good faith?

321
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:33,533
What's this?

322
00:25:02,996 --> 00:25:06,165
Your husband was
an honorable man.

323
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,903
He should rest beside his family
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

324
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:16,710
- You may not believe--
- Get out.

325
00:25:48,575 --> 00:25:52,245
<i>Get up, you dogs!</i>

326
00:26:02,756 --> 00:26:06,057
That's him,
the one who picks.

327
00:26:06,092 --> 00:26:08,226
The Mountain.

328
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:12,863
What are you doing?

329
00:26:12,897 --> 00:26:15,032
He told me he stares
at him every day.

330
00:26:15,066 --> 00:26:17,535
That's why he
doesn't get picked.

331
00:26:42,928 --> 00:26:44,796
You.

332
00:26:44,831 --> 00:26:47,566
<i>Move, boy!</i>

333
00:26:47,601 --> 00:26:50,069
Move!

334
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:10,724
<i>Is there gold and silver</i>
<i>in the village?</i>

335
00:27:10,758 --> 00:27:13,260
- I don't know.
- <i>Gems?</i>

336
00:27:13,294 --> 00:27:15,495
I didn't see any.

337
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,898
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know.

338
00:27:33,715 --> 00:27:36,583
<i>- Where is the Brotherhood?</i>
- I don't know. Please.

339
00:27:36,617 --> 00:27:39,419
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know.

340
00:27:44,825 --> 00:27:46,793
Which of the villagers
aided them?

341
00:27:46,827 --> 00:27:49,395
- I don't know.
- Who?

342
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:51,631
I--

343
00:27:54,034 --> 00:27:57,003
- Who?
- I never saw.

344
00:27:57,037 --> 00:27:58,671
- Who?
- I never saw.

345
00:27:58,705 --> 00:28:01,808
Please. Please, stop.
Please, it's starting to--

346
00:28:01,842 --> 00:28:05,145
- <i>Who?</i>
- I didn't see anyone help him.

347
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:07,581
Take it off! Take it off!

348
00:28:07,615 --> 00:28:09,982
- <i>Who helped him?</i>
- Ganes the butcher

349
00:28:10,017 --> 00:28:11,851
- and his son.
- That's better.

350
00:28:11,885 --> 00:28:15,121
- <i>You've been very helpful.</i>
- No, stop, please!

351
00:28:15,155 --> 00:28:17,556
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Please, stop!</i>

352
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,092
<i>Please, stop!</i>
<i>No! No!</i>

353
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:22,327
I told you everything!
No!

354
00:28:22,361 --> 00:28:25,664
No!

355
00:28:25,698 --> 00:28:28,933
Joffrey.

356
00:28:28,968 --> 00:28:31,069
Cersei.

357
00:28:31,103 --> 00:28:33,572
Ilyn Payne.
The Hound.

358
00:28:33,606 --> 00:28:36,341
<i>Please, Polliver.</i>
<i>Some food.</i>

359
00:28:36,376 --> 00:28:39,111
Just a crust of bread.

360
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:45,385
Polliver.

361
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,688
The Mountain.

362
00:29:04,705 --> 00:29:07,774
Lady Stark, I had not thought
to find you in the Stormlands.

363
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:11,377
I had not thought
to be here, Lord Stannis.

364
00:29:11,411 --> 00:29:14,780
- Can that truly be you?
- Who else might it be?

365
00:29:14,815 --> 00:29:17,550
When I saw your standard,
I couldn't be sure.

366
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:20,119
- Whose banner is that?
- My own.

367
00:29:20,154 --> 00:29:22,722
I suppose if we used
the same one,

368
00:29:22,757 --> 00:29:25,525
the battle would be
terribly confusing.

369
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,761
<i>Why is your stag</i>
<i>on fire?</i>

370
00:29:28,897 --> 00:29:30,631
The King has taken
for his sigil

371
00:29:30,665 --> 00:29:32,667
the fiery heart
of the Lord of Light.

372
00:29:32,701 --> 00:29:37,138
Ah, you must be this fire
priestess we hear so much about.

373
00:29:37,172 --> 00:29:39,374
<i>Mm, brother,</i>

374
00:29:39,408 --> 00:29:42,677
now I understand why you
found religion in your old age.

375
00:29:42,712 --> 00:29:44,146
Watch yourself, Renly.

376
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,216
<i>No, no, I'm relieved.</i>

377
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,418
I never really believed
you're a fanatic.

378
00:29:49,453 --> 00:29:52,788
Charmless, rigid,
a bore, yes,

379
00:29:52,823 --> 00:29:54,624
but not a godly man.

380
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:59,362
You should kneel
he's the Lord's chosen,

381
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:01,732
<i>born amidst salt</i>
<i>and smoke.</i>

382
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,934
Born amidst salt
and smoke?

383
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,236
Is he a ham?

384
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,205
<i>That's twice</i>
<i>I've warned you.</i>

385
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,140
Listen to yourselves.

386
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:12,410
If you were sons of mine, I
would knock your heads together

387
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:14,112
and lock you in a bedchamber
until you remembered

388
00:30:14,137 --> 00:30:15,747
that you were brothers.

389
00:30:15,748 --> 00:30:18,449
It is strange to find you
beside my brother, Lady Stark.

390
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,285
<i>Your husband was a supporter</i>
<i>of my claim.</i>

391
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,354
Lord Eddard's integrity
cost him his head.

392
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:26,423
And you sit beside this pretender
and chastise me.

393
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,125
We share a common enemy.

394
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,862
The Iron Throne
is mine by right.

395
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:35,332
All those that deny that
are my foes.

396
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,602
The whole realm denies it,
from Dorne to the Wall.

397
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:40,371
Old men deny it
with their death rattle

398
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:43,274
and unborn children deny it
in their mother's wombs.

399
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,511
No one wants you
for their King.

400
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:50,747
<i>You never wanted</i>
<i>any friends, brother.</i>

401
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:53,216
<i>But a man without friends</i>
<i>is a man without power.</i>

402
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:56,786
For the sake of the mother
who bore us,

403
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,189
I will give you this one night
to reconsider.

404
00:30:59,223 --> 00:31:01,825
Strike your banners,

405
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:04,460
come to me before dawn,

406
00:31:04,494 --> 00:31:07,396
and I will grant you
your old seat in the council.

407
00:31:08,565 --> 00:31:11,366
I'll even name you
my heir

408
00:31:11,401 --> 00:31:13,235
until a son
is born to me.

409
00:31:15,305 --> 00:31:17,573
Otherwise I shall
destroy you.

410
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:23,012
Look across
those fields, brother.

411
00:31:23,046 --> 00:31:25,682
<i>Can you see</i>
<i>all those banners?</i>

412
00:31:25,716 --> 00:31:28,452
You think a few bolts
of cloth will make you King?

413
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,654
No.

414
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:33,825
The men holding those bolts
of cloth will make me King.

415
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:35,727
We shall see, Renly.

416
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:38,497
Come the dawn,
we shall see.

417
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:40,699
Look to your sins,
Lord Renly.

418
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:43,235
The night is dark
and full of terrors.

419
00:31:48,775 --> 00:31:52,343
Would you believe
I loved him once?

420
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:14,733
I thought we were welcome.

421
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:17,636
If you heard a Dothraki horde
was approaching your city,

422
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,704
you might do the same,
Khaleesi.

423
00:32:22,074 --> 00:32:24,108
Horde?

424
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,858
My name is Daenerys--

425
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:44,128
Daenerys Stormborn
of the House Targaryen.

426
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:46,197
You know me, My Lord?

427
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:48,867
Only by reputation,
Khaleesi.

428
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:52,437
And I'm no lord,
merely a humble merchant.

429
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,175
They call you
the Mother of Dragons.

430
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:58,177
And what should
I call you?

431
00:32:58,211 --> 00:32:59,779
Oh, my name is quite long

432
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:02,382
and quite impossible
for foreigners to pronounce.

433
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:06,020
I am simply a trader
of spices.

434
00:33:06,054 --> 00:33:09,390
But we are the Thirteen,

435
00:33:09,425 --> 00:33:12,761
charged with the governance
and protection of Qarth,

436
00:33:12,795 --> 00:33:16,498
the greatest city
that ever was or will be.

437
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,333
The beauty of
Quarth is legendary--

438
00:33:20,358 --> 00:33:22,358
Qarth.

439
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,440
Qarth.

440
00:33:25,475 --> 00:33:28,510
Might we see
the dragons?

441
00:33:33,116 --> 00:33:36,518
My friend,

442
00:33:36,553 --> 00:33:38,987
we have travelled
very far.

443
00:33:39,021 --> 00:33:41,522
<i>We have no food,</i>
<i>no water.</i>

444
00:33:41,557 --> 00:33:44,024
Once I see my people fed,
I would be honored--

445
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:46,894
Forgive me,
Mother of Dragons,

446
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:50,931
but no man alive has seen
a living dragon.

447
00:33:50,965 --> 00:33:53,133
Some of my more
skeptical friends

448
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:56,603
refuse to believe
your children

449
00:33:56,637 --> 00:33:58,538
even exist.

450
00:33:58,573 --> 00:34:01,975
<i>All we ask is the chance</i>
<i>to see for ourselves.</i>

451
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:03,977
I am not a liar.

452
00:34:04,012 --> 00:34:06,046
Oh, I don't think you are.

453
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,781
But as I've never
met you before,

454
00:34:07,815 --> 00:34:11,018
my opinion on the matter
is of limited value.

455
00:34:12,554 --> 00:34:14,989
Where I come from,

456
00:34:15,023 --> 00:34:17,491
guests are treated
with respect,

457
00:34:17,526 --> 00:34:20,828
not insulted
at the gates.

458
00:34:20,862 --> 00:34:23,363
Then perhaps you should
return to where you come from.

459
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:25,599
We wish you well.

460
00:34:29,104 --> 00:34:31,005
What are you doing?

461
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:33,840
You promised
to receive me.

462
00:34:34,942 --> 00:34:36,343
We have received you.

463
00:34:36,377 --> 00:34:39,079
Here we are,
and here you are.

464
00:34:39,113 --> 00:34:43,017
If you do not let us in,
all of us will die.

465
00:34:43,051 --> 00:34:45,753
Which we shall
deeply regret.

466
00:34:45,787 --> 00:34:46,858
But Qarth did not become

467
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:49,003
the greatest city that
ever was or will be

468
00:34:49,024 --> 00:34:52,694
by letting Dothraki savages
through its gates.

469
00:34:59,568 --> 00:35:01,803
Khaleesi, please
be careful.

470
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,242
Thirteen!

471
00:35:07,276 --> 00:35:09,778
When my dragons are grown,

472
00:35:09,812 --> 00:35:12,914
we will take back
what was stolen from me

473
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:15,283
and destroy those
who have wronged me.

474
00:35:15,318 --> 00:35:17,786
We will lay waste
to armies

475
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,521
and burn cities
to the ground.

476
00:35:20,556 --> 00:35:24,525
Turn us away and we will
burn you first.

477
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,727
Ah.

478
00:35:26,762 --> 00:35:29,530
You are a true
Targaryen.

479
00:35:29,565 --> 00:35:32,700
Only, as you said
a moment ago,

480
00:35:32,734 --> 00:35:34,335
if we don't let you
into the city,

481
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:36,871
you will all die.
And so...

482
00:35:36,905 --> 00:35:39,540
Retreating in fear
from a little girl

483
00:35:39,574 --> 00:35:41,742
is unbecoming
of the greatest city

484
00:35:41,776 --> 00:35:43,344
that ever was
or will be.

485
00:35:43,378 --> 00:35:46,915
The discussion is over,
Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

486
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:48,950
The Thirteen have spoken.

487
00:35:48,985 --> 00:35:51,720
I am one of the Thirteen

488
00:35:51,754 --> 00:35:54,189
and I am still speaking.

489
00:35:54,223 --> 00:35:56,558
The girl threatens to burn
our city to the ground

490
00:35:56,592 --> 00:35:59,761
and you would invite her in
for a cup of wine?

491
00:35:59,795 --> 00:36:01,863
She is the Mother
of Dragons.

492
00:36:01,897 --> 00:36:05,199
Do you expect her to watch
her people starve

493
00:36:05,233 --> 00:36:07,334
without breathing fire?

494
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:09,937
<i>I believe we can allow</i>
<i>a few Dothraki</i>

495
00:36:09,971 --> 00:36:12,539
<i>through our gates</i>
<i>without dooming our city.</i>

496
00:36:12,574 --> 00:36:15,877
<i>After all, here I am,</i>

497
00:36:15,911 --> 00:36:17,979
a savage from
the Summer Isles,

498
00:36:18,013 --> 00:36:19,882
and Qarth still stands.

499
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:22,818
Our decision is final.

500
00:36:22,853 --> 00:36:24,988
Very well.

501
00:36:27,258 --> 00:36:29,860
I invoke <i>Soumai.</i>

502
00:36:33,698 --> 00:36:36,365
<i>I will vouch for her,</i>
<i>her people,</i>

503
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,768
<i>and her dragons</i>
<i>in accordance with the law.</i>

504
00:36:45,775 --> 00:36:47,775
Be it on your head.

505
00:36:49,177 --> 00:36:52,145
Welcome to Qarth,
My Lady.

506
00:37:41,662 --> 00:37:44,064
<i>You.</i>

507
00:37:52,508 --> 00:37:54,942
Is there gold or silver
in the village?

508
00:37:54,976 --> 00:37:57,878
- I'm not from the village.
- Where is the Brotherhood?

509
00:37:58,847 --> 00:38:00,514
I don't know
what that is.

510
00:38:29,612 --> 00:38:34,082
<i>You two, take Lord Lannister's</i>
<i>things to his quarters.</i>

511
00:38:34,117 --> 00:38:35,717
What's this?

512
00:38:35,752 --> 00:38:38,420
We weren't expecting you
till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.

513
00:38:38,454 --> 00:38:41,090
Evidently not.

514
00:38:43,126 --> 00:38:44,927
Why are these prisoners
not in their cells?

515
00:38:44,961 --> 00:38:47,330
<i>Cells are overflowing,</i>
<i>My Lord.</i>

516
00:38:47,364 --> 00:38:48,965
<i>This lot won't be here long.</i>

517
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:51,401
<i>Don't need</i>
<i>no permanent place.</i>

518
00:38:51,435 --> 00:38:54,438
After we interrogate 'em,
we usually just...

519
00:38:54,472 --> 00:38:58,809
Are we so well-manned
that we can afford to discard

520
00:38:58,844 --> 00:39:01,646
able young bodies
and skilled laborers?

521
00:39:11,191 --> 00:39:13,860
You,
do you have a trade?

522
00:39:14,796 --> 00:39:16,696
<i>Smith, My Lord.</i>

523
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:20,567
What are you looking at?
Kneel!

524
00:39:22,136 --> 00:39:25,405
Kneel or I'll carve
your lungs out, boy.

525
00:39:25,439 --> 00:39:27,740
He'll do no such thing.

526
00:39:27,774 --> 00:39:31,477
This one's a girl,
you idiot,

527
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:32,878
dressed as a boy.

528
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,981
- Why?
- Safer to travel, My Lord.

529
00:39:36,015 --> 00:39:38,116
Smart.

530
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:40,018
More than I can say
for this lot.

531
00:39:40,052 --> 00:39:42,721
Get these prisoners
to work.

532
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,689
Bring the girl.

533
00:39:44,724 --> 00:39:46,791
I need a new
cupbearer.

534
00:39:46,826 --> 00:39:48,427
<i>My Lord.</i>

535
00:39:55,836 --> 00:39:57,837
Your visits
are too few, cousin.

536
00:39:57,872 --> 00:39:59,472
Her Grace,
the Queen Regent,

537
00:39:59,506 --> 00:40:01,875
commands you to release
Grand Maester Pycelle.

538
00:40:01,909 --> 00:40:05,245
- Here's your warrant.
- So it is.

539
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:07,648
Will you take
a cup with me?

540
00:40:07,682 --> 00:40:10,151
I find that mulled wine
helps me sleep.

541
00:40:10,218 --> 00:40:12,186
<i>I am here</i>
<i>at Her Grace's behest,</i>

542
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,388
not to drink
with you, Imp.

543
00:40:14,422 --> 00:40:17,291
If my sister was
so concerned for Pycelle,

544
00:40:17,325 --> 00:40:19,526
<i>I would have thought</i>
<i>she'd come herself.</i>

545
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,594
Instead she sends you.

546
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:23,062
What am I to make
of that?

547
00:40:23,097 --> 00:40:25,131
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>what you make of it,</i>

548
00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:27,199
so long as you release
your prisoner immediately.

549
00:40:27,234 --> 00:40:31,337
And you've received these
instructions directly from Cersei?

550
00:40:31,371 --> 00:40:33,639
As I said several times.

551
00:40:33,674 --> 00:40:36,576
And you've waited this long
to deliver the information?

552
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,810
When the Queen Regent
gives me a command, I carry

553
00:40:38,835 --> 00:40:40,835
it out without delay.

554
00:40:43,218 --> 00:40:45,886
Cersei must have
great trust in you,

555
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,122
<i>allowing you</i>
<i>into her chamber</i>

556
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:51,025
during the hour
of the wolf.

557
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,832
The Queen Regent has a great
many responsibilities.

558
00:40:57,866 --> 00:40:59,467
She often works
from dusk till dawn.

559
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:01,835
She must be very glad
to have you helping her

560
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:04,204
from dusk till dawn.

561
00:41:04,238 --> 00:41:07,239
Ah, lavender oil.

562
00:41:07,274 --> 00:41:09,809
She always loved lavender oil,
even as a girl.

563
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:11,477
I am a knight!

564
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,280
An anointed knight, yes.

565
00:41:14,314 --> 00:41:16,883
Tell me, did Cersei
have you knighted

566
00:41:16,917 --> 00:41:20,487
before or after she took
you into her bed?

567
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:23,157
What?
Nothing to say?

568
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:25,092
No more warnings
for me, Ser?

569
00:41:25,127 --> 00:41:27,061
You will withdraw
these filthy accusations.

570
00:41:27,096 --> 00:41:28,663
Have you ever given
any thought

571
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,598
to what King Joffrey
will have to say

572
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:34,035
when he finds out you've
been bedding his mother?

573
00:41:37,606 --> 00:41:39,507
It's not my fault!

574
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:42,209
Did she take you
against your will?

575
00:41:42,243 --> 00:41:44,244
Can you not defend
yourself, knight?

576
00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:47,514
Your own father, Lord Tywin,
when I was named the King's squire,

577
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:49,483
he told me to obey her
in everything.

578
00:41:49,517 --> 00:41:51,384
Did he tell you
to fuck her, too?

579
00:41:51,418 --> 00:41:54,654
I only meant
I did as I was bid.

580
00:41:54,688 --> 00:41:56,456
Hated every
moment of it,

581
00:41:56,491 --> 00:41:58,491
is that what you'll
have me believe?

582
00:41:58,526 --> 00:42:00,561
A high place in court,
a knighthood,

583
00:42:00,595 --> 00:42:02,830
my sister's legs spreading
open for you at night.

584
00:42:02,864 --> 00:42:05,199
Oh, yes, it must
have been terrible.

585
00:42:05,233 --> 00:42:07,235
Wait here. His Grace will want
to hear this.

586
00:42:07,269 --> 00:42:09,538
Mercy!
Mercy, My Lord! I beg you.

587
00:42:09,572 --> 00:42:11,173
Save it for Joffrey.
He loves a good grovel.

588
00:42:11,207 --> 00:42:12,928
My Lord, it was
your sister's bidding--

589
00:42:12,953 --> 00:42:14,043
the Queen.

590
00:42:14,044 --> 00:42:15,911
I'll leave the city
at once, I swear.

591
00:42:15,946 --> 00:42:19,148
- No, I think not.
- My Lord?

592
00:42:19,182 --> 00:42:21,149
You heard me.

593
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,228
My father told you
to obey my sister.

594
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:27,689
Obey her.

595
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:31,059
Stay close to her side.
Keep her trust.

596
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:33,161
Pleasure her
whenever she requires.

597
00:42:33,195 --> 00:42:35,263
No one ever need know

598
00:42:35,297 --> 00:42:38,733
as long as you keep
faith with me.

599
00:42:39,868 --> 00:42:42,235
I want to know
what Cersei is doing,

600
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:45,138
where she goes,
who she sees,

601
00:42:45,172 --> 00:42:47,573
what they talk of--
everything.

602
00:42:47,608 --> 00:42:49,608
And you will tell me.

603
00:42:49,643 --> 00:42:52,011
Yes, My Lord, I will.

604
00:42:52,045 --> 00:42:54,346
I swear it,
as you command.

605
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:59,918
Oh, rise, rise.

606
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:03,122
Let us drink to
our understanding.

607
00:43:03,156 --> 00:43:05,691
Oh, you don't have
a cup. Oh, well.

608
00:43:05,726 --> 00:43:08,795
Smile, cousin. My sister
is a beautiful woman.

609
00:43:08,829 --> 00:43:10,463
And it's all for
the good of the realm.

610
00:43:10,497 --> 00:43:13,099
Go back and tell her
that I beg her forgiveness,

611
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:15,201
that I want no more
conflict between us

612
00:43:15,235 --> 00:43:16,979
and that henceforth

613
00:43:17,004 --> 00:43:18,972
I shall do nothing
without her consent.

614
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:20,273
But her demands.

615
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:22,942
Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.

616
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:25,211
- You will?
- Yes, I'll release him in the morning.

617
00:43:25,246 --> 00:43:27,180
<i>Cersei can keep him</i>
<i>as a pet if she wants,</i>

618
00:43:27,214 --> 00:43:29,215
<i>but I will not have him</i>
<i>on the council.</i>

619
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:32,085
I could swear that I had not
harmed a single hair on his head,

620
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:35,622
but that would not,
strictly speaking, be true.

621
00:43:46,234 --> 00:43:49,902
<i>Stay within</i>
<i>one table length.</i>

622
00:43:54,575 --> 00:43:56,876
Your Grace.

623
00:44:01,415 --> 00:44:03,749
Do your knucklebones
bring you luck?

624
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:09,654
Well, life's been good since you
hacked them off, Your Grace.

625
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,090
And it's four less
fingernails to clean.

626
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:14,659
- Fewer.
- Pardon?

627
00:44:15,661 --> 00:44:17,629
Four fewer
fingernails to clean.

628
00:44:17,663 --> 00:44:20,999
Never understood
why you had to wear them.

629
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:24,002
It reminds me of where I
come from and where I am now.

630
00:44:25,438 --> 00:44:27,073
It reminds me
of your justice.

631
00:44:27,107 --> 00:44:28,608
It was an honest
punishment

632
00:44:28,642 --> 00:44:30,177
and you were good
with the cleaver.

633
00:44:30,211 --> 00:44:32,879
You were a hero
and a smuggler.

634
00:44:32,914 --> 00:44:36,349
A good act does not
wash out the bad,

635
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:39,251
nor a bad the good.

636
00:44:39,286 --> 00:44:41,754
A lesson I've tried
to teach my son.

637
00:44:41,788 --> 00:44:43,889
- Does he listen?
- To me?

638
00:44:43,924 --> 00:44:46,592
Gods, no.

639
00:44:46,626 --> 00:44:49,394
But if your red woman told him
to leap from the crow's nest--

640
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:51,730
She has a name.

641
00:44:54,533 --> 00:44:57,135
I trust you've not forgotten
your smuggler's tricks.

642
00:44:59,439 --> 00:45:01,474
I've lived within
the law for 17--

643
00:45:01,508 --> 00:45:03,909
I want you to be
a smuggler this time.

644
00:45:03,944 --> 00:45:06,512
Any shore, any night.

645
00:45:06,547 --> 00:45:08,281
What am I bringing
ashore?

646
00:45:08,316 --> 00:45:10,150
The red woman.

647
00:45:11,853 --> 00:45:14,021
No one must know
what you do

648
00:45:14,055 --> 00:45:15,656
and we'll not speak
of this again.

649
00:45:15,691 --> 00:45:19,226
I am true to Your Grace
and always will be,

650
00:45:19,261 --> 00:45:22,229
but surely there are
other ways, cleaner ways.

651
00:45:22,264 --> 00:45:24,698
Cleaner ways
don't win wars.

652
00:45:54,432 --> 00:45:57,400
Are you afraid,
Onion Knight?

653
00:45:59,637 --> 00:46:00,886
Someone once told me

654
00:46:00,911 --> 00:46:03,309
the night is dark and
full of terrors.

655
00:46:05,008 --> 00:46:07,710
You've carried more
unpleasant cargo in your time.

656
00:46:11,614 --> 00:46:14,550
Are you a good man,
Ser Davos Seaworth?

657
00:46:14,584 --> 00:46:16,544
I'd say my parts
are mixed, My Lady--

658
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:18,454
good and bad.

659
00:46:18,455 --> 00:46:20,957
If half an onion
is black with rot,

660
00:46:20,991 --> 00:46:22,892
it's a rotten onion.

661
00:46:22,927 --> 00:46:25,629
A man is good
or he is evil.

662
00:46:25,663 --> 00:46:27,530
- And which are you?
- <i>Oh, good.</i>

663
00:46:27,565 --> 00:46:30,867
I'm a knight myself
of sorts,

664
00:46:30,902 --> 00:46:33,737
a champion of light
and life.

665
00:46:33,771 --> 00:46:36,940
Well, that must be
very nice for you.

666
00:46:53,194 --> 00:46:57,330
- Do you love your wife?
- I do.

667
00:46:57,365 --> 00:46:59,666
Yet you have known
other women.

668
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,534
Don't talk about my wife.

669
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:05,538
I'm not. I'm talking about
other women.

670
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,940
Like me, Ser Davos.

671
00:47:12,212 --> 00:47:14,113
You want me.

672
00:47:14,148 --> 00:47:17,116
You want to see
what's beneath this robe.

673
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:20,920
And you will.

674
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:28,496
Strange that
this Lord of Light

675
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:31,399
asks you to work
in the shadows.

676
00:47:31,433 --> 00:47:34,702
Shadows cannot live
in the dark, Ser Davos.

677
00:47:34,737 --> 00:47:37,238
They are servants
of light,

678
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:39,707
the children of fire.

679
00:47:39,741 --> 00:47:43,177
And the brighter the flame,
the darker they are.

680
00:47:43,211 --> 00:47:46,046
These weren't here before.
They've barred the passage.

681
00:47:47,549 --> 00:47:49,816
They can't bar
our passage.

682
00:47:55,223 --> 00:47:56,757
Gods protect us.

683
00:47:56,791 --> 00:48:00,294
There's only one God,
Ser Davos,

684
00:48:00,328 --> 00:48:03,030
and he only protects
those who serve him.

685
