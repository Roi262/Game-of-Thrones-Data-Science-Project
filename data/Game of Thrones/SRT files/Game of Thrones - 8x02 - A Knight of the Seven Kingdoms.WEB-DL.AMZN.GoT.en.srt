1
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,928
What if the Seven Kingdoms

2
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:14,969
were ruled by a just woman
and an honorable man?

3
00:00:15,637 --> 00:00:17,428
You're Aegon Targaryen...

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,094
true heir to the Iron Throne.

5
00:00:21,386 --> 00:00:22,595
You've always been.

6
00:00:24,428 --> 00:00:26,720
She doesn't need to be my friend.

7
00:00:28,053 --> 00:00:29,178
But I am her queen.

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,470
We must fight together now...

9
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:34,261
or die.

10
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:37,261
The things I do for love.

11
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:31,817

12
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:41,845
When I was a child, my brother
would tell me a bedtime story...

13
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:46,053
about the man who murdered our father.

14
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:50,969
Who stabbed him in the back
and cut his throat.

15
00:02:51,053 --> 00:02:53,969
Who sat down on the Iron Throne
and watched

16
00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:56,720
as his blood poured onto the floor.

17
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,678
He told me other stories as well.

18
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:04,053
About all the things
we would do to that man...

19
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:07,261
once we took back the Seven Kingdoms

20
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:08,803
and had him in our grasp.

21
00:03:10,803 --> 00:03:14,178
Your sister pledged
to send her army north.

22
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,345
She did.

23
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:17,511
I don't see an army.

24
00:03:17,595 --> 00:03:21,303
I see one man, with one hand.

25
00:03:21,386 --> 00:03:23,136
It appears your sister lied to me.

26
00:03:26,094 --> 00:03:28,261
She lied to me as well.

27
00:03:29,762 --> 00:03:32,470
She never had any intention
of sending her army north.

28
00:03:32,553 --> 00:03:37,470
She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet
and 20,000 fresh troops.

29
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:40,386
The Golden Company from Essos,

30
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,011
bought and paid for.

31
00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:43,887
Even if we defeat the dead,

32
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:46,094
she'll have more than enough
to destroy the survivors.

33
00:03:46,178 --> 00:03:47,637
"We"?

34
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:50,637
I promised to fight for the living.

35
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,094
I intend to keep that promise.

36
00:03:55,011 --> 00:03:58,470
- Your Grace, I know my brother...
- Like you knew your sister?

37
00:04:00,303 --> 00:04:03,595
He came here alone, knowing
full well how he'd be received.

38
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:07,136
Why would he do that
if he weren't telling the truth?

39
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:10,136
Perhaps he trusts his
little brother to defend him,

40
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:13,595
right up to the moment
he slits my throat.

41
00:04:13,678 --> 00:04:15,803
You're right.
We can't trust him.

42
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:18,803
He attacked my father in the streets.

43
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:21,303
He tried to destroy
my house and my family,

44
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,595
the same as he did yours.

45
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:24,595
Do you want me to apologize?

46
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:25,678
I won't.

47
00:04:26,678 --> 00:04:28,011
We were at war.

48
00:04:28,094 --> 00:04:30,762
Everything I did, I did
for my house and my family.

49
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:31,845
I'd do it all again.

50
00:04:33,178 --> 00:04:35,345
The things we do for love.

51
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:45,136
So why have you abandoned
your house and family now?

52
00:04:47,136 --> 00:04:49,178
Because this goes beyond loyalty.

53
00:04:52,637 --> 00:04:54,303
This is about survival.

54
00:05:01,303 --> 00:05:04,053
You don't know me well, Your Grace.

55
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,803
But I know Ser Jaime.

56
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:09,511
He is a man of honor.

57
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,428
I was his captor once.

58
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:14,094
But when we were both taken prisoner

59
00:05:14,178 --> 00:05:17,136
and the men holding us
tried to force themselves on me,

60
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:18,720
Ser Jaime defended me.

61
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:22,386
And lost his hand because of it.

62
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:29,720
Without him, my lady,
you would not be alive.

63
00:05:29,803 --> 00:05:32,428
He armed me, armored me,

64
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:34,678
and sent me to find you
and bring you home

65
00:05:34,762 --> 00:05:38,386
because he'd sworn an oath
to your mother.

66
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,928
You vouch for him?

67
00:05:48,887 --> 00:05:49,969
I do.

68
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,928
You would fight beside him?

69
00:06:00,637 --> 00:06:01,928
I would.

70
00:06:06,386 --> 00:06:08,219
I trust you with my life.

71
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:11,470
If you trust him with yours,

72
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:13,762
we should let him stay.

73
00:06:19,094 --> 00:06:21,928
What does the Warden
of the North say about it?

74
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,595
We need every man we can get.

75
00:06:39,303 --> 00:06:40,219
Very well.

76
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:03,303
Thank you, Your Grace.

77
00:07:41,553 --> 00:07:44,720
Either you knew Cersei was lying
and let me believe otherwise,

78
00:07:44,803 --> 00:07:46,053
or you didn't know at all.

79
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:48,219
Which makes you
either a traitor or a fool.

80
00:07:48,303 --> 00:07:50,553
- I was a fool.
- Not for the first time.

81
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:53,637
Cersei still sits on the throne.

82
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,428
If you can't help me take it back,

83
00:07:55,511 --> 00:07:57,470
I'll find another Hand who can.

84
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,762
I suspect one of you
will be wearing this

85
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:06,928
before it's all over.

86
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:14,219
Coming through.

87
00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:02,303
Don't you have something better to do?

88
00:09:02,386 --> 00:09:04,678
You make my weapon yet?

89
00:09:04,762 --> 00:09:08,762
Just as soon as I'm done
making a few thousand of these.

90
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:10,386
You should make mine first.

91
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,511
And make sure it's stronger than this.

92
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:15,470
It's strong enough.

93
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:22,511
It's going to be safer
down in the crypt, you know.

94
00:09:23,803 --> 00:09:25,887
Are you going to be down in the crypt?

95
00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:28,094
- No, but...
- But you're a fighter.

96
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:30,428
I've done my share.

97
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,011
You've fought them?

98
00:09:34,094 --> 00:09:36,178
I did. Some of them.

99
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:38,595
How many?

100
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:39,637
A few.

101
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:42,345
That was enough.

102
00:09:45,136 --> 00:09:46,762
What are they like?

103
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:48,803
Bad.

104
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:51,428
Really bad.

105
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:53,136
"Really bad"?

106
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,511
Even a smith's apprentice
can do better than "really bad."

107
00:09:59,595 --> 00:10:01,887
What do they look like?
What do they smell like?

108
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,094
How do they move?
How hard are they to kill?

109
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:05,762
Look, I know you want to fight.

110
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:09,178
And I know you're not scared
of rapers or murderers or...

111
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:11,011
This is different. This is...

112
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,386
This is death.

113
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,553
You want to know
what they're like? Death.

114
00:10:15,637 --> 00:10:17,470
That's what they're like.

115
00:10:25,345 --> 00:10:26,637
I know Death.

116
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:30,511
He's got many faces.

117
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:35,969
I look forward to seeing this one.

118
00:10:43,553 --> 00:10:46,219
- My weapon?
- I'll get right on it.

119
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:22,595
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

120
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:27,969
You weren't sorry then.

121
00:11:29,178 --> 00:11:31,720
You were protecting your family.

122
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:35,178
I'm not that person anymore.

123
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,511
You still would be,

124
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:39,470
if you hadn't pushed me
out of that window.

125
00:11:39,553 --> 00:11:42,219
And I would still be Brandon Stark.

126
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:45,969
- You're not?
- No.

127
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:48,303
I'm something else now.

128
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:51,261
You're not angry at me.

129
00:11:52,386 --> 00:11:53,845
I'm not angry at anyone.

130
00:11:53,928 --> 00:11:55,928
Why didn't you tell them?

131
00:11:56,011 --> 00:11:58,595
You won't be able to help us
in this fight

132
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:00,261
if I let them murder you first.

133
00:12:05,178 --> 00:12:07,011
What about afterwards?

134
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:10,178
How do you know there is an afterwards?

135
00:12:20,803 --> 00:12:21,969
Next up.

136
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:30,303
Put a marker in the ground!

137
00:12:31,637 --> 00:12:33,928
Bring it up to the wall!

138
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:35,845
Up to the wall. All right.

139
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:38,136
- All right.
- All right.

140
00:12:39,553 --> 00:12:42,345
Well, here we are.

141
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,928
Yes, here we are.

142
00:12:44,011 --> 00:12:45,428
Together again.

143
00:12:49,011 --> 00:12:50,969
And the masses rejoice.

144
00:12:52,678 --> 00:12:54,887
How do they feel about their new queen?

145
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:56,511
She's your new queen too.

146
00:12:58,803 --> 00:13:00,094
They remember what happened

147
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:02,637
the last time Targaryens
brought dragons north.

148
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,595
They'll come around

149
00:13:04,678 --> 00:13:06,428
once they see Daenerys is different.

150
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:08,887
And she is? Different?

151
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:10,261
She is.

152
00:13:10,345 --> 00:13:12,511
- You're sure about her?
- I am.

153
00:13:12,595 --> 00:13:15,094
She didn't seem sure about you.

154
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:17,094
It's hard to blame her.

155
00:13:17,178 --> 00:13:19,136
I made a mistake
common to clever people.

156
00:13:19,219 --> 00:13:22,178
- I underestimated my opponents.
- Hmm.

157
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:25,511
Cersei told me the pregnancy
had changed her.

158
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:27,470
A chance for you both to start again.

159
00:13:27,553 --> 00:13:28,845
And I believed her.

160
00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:30,595
That stuff can go on the end.

161
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:33,345
Was she lying about the baby too?

162
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:37,011
No, that part is real.

163
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,011
She's always been good
at using the truth to tell lies.

164
00:13:44,094 --> 00:13:45,928
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

165
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:47,637
She's fooled me more than anybody.

166
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,887
No, he's right there.

167
00:13:49,969 --> 00:13:51,637
What?

168
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,136
She never fooled you.

169
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:56,887
You always knew exactly what she was,

170
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,386
and you loved her anyway.

171
00:14:09,887 --> 00:14:10,928
So...

172
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:15,595
...we're going to die
at Winterfell.

173
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:19,595
Not the death I would've chosen.

174
00:14:20,762 --> 00:14:22,303
I always pictured myself

175
00:14:22,386 --> 00:14:24,261
dying in my own bed,

176
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:25,720
the age of 80,

177
00:14:25,803 --> 00:14:28,428
- with a belly full of wine and
- ...a girl's mouth

178
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:30,762
- around your cock.
- around my cock.

179
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:37,094
At least Cersei won't get to murder me.

180
00:14:37,178 --> 00:14:39,720
I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction

181
00:14:39,803 --> 00:14:41,261
denying her that pleasure

182
00:14:41,345 --> 00:14:44,345
while I'm being ripped apart
by dead men.

183
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,428
Maybe after I'm dead...

184
00:14:50,553 --> 00:14:52,261
I'll march down to King's Landing

185
00:14:52,345 --> 00:14:53,637
and rip her apart.

186
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,637
You will see the Army of the Dead.

187
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:08,011
Good.

188
00:15:25,345 --> 00:15:27,511
Good. Yes, aim.

189
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:32,094
Don't rush.

190
00:15:32,178 --> 00:15:33,178
Come forward.

191
00:15:35,094 --> 00:15:36,928
- Come on.
- Ser Jaime.

192
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:38,678
Lady Brienne.

193
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:49,428
- He's come a long way.
- He's all right.

194
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:51,053
One more time. Come on.

195
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:54,428
- Still has a lot to learn.
- I'm sure you'll teach him.

196
00:15:54,511 --> 00:15:55,720
Better, better.

197
00:15:55,803 --> 00:15:58,261
I've been told you're commanding
the left flank.

198
00:15:58,345 --> 00:15:59,678
I am.

199
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:02,511
It's, uh... It's good ground.

200
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,219
It is.

201
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:07,094
The rise, it should give us
some advantage.

202
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:08,720
If we can keep a tight formation,

203
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:10,803
we might be able to beat them back.

204
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,136
Yes, I think you're right.

205
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:14,969
- What are you doing?
- What?

206
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:17,720
- I think you know.
- I truly don't.

207
00:16:17,803 --> 00:16:20,053
We have never had a conversation
last this long

208
00:16:20,136 --> 00:16:21,845
without you insulting me.
Not once.

209
00:16:21,928 --> 00:16:23,011
You want me to insult you?

210
00:16:23,094 --> 00:16:24,219
- No!
- Good.

211
00:16:31,053 --> 00:16:33,219
I came to Winterfell because...

212
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:40,386
I'm not the fighter I used to be.

213
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:44,803
But I'd be honored
to serve under your command,

214
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:46,261
if you'll have me.

215
00:16:55,511 --> 00:16:57,053
I better get back.

216
00:17:18,094 --> 00:17:19,595
Forgive me, khaleesi.

217
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:24,345
Have you done something to offend me?

218
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:25,553
Many things.

219
00:17:25,637 --> 00:17:27,928
Long ago and long forgiven.

220
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:29,553
But you did forgive,

221
00:17:30,553 --> 00:17:32,094
despite my failures.

222
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:38,011
When I heard you'd named Tyrion
your Hand,

223
00:17:39,303 --> 00:17:41,219
it broke my heart.

224
00:17:41,303 --> 00:17:42,969
When I named him Hand,

225
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:45,887
I didn't know
if I'd ever see you again.

226
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:47,845
You made the right choice.

227
00:17:47,928 --> 00:17:50,720
I wasn't under the impression
you liked him very much.

228
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,053
I didn't.

229
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:53,595
His mouth hardly stopped moving

230
00:17:53,678 --> 00:17:55,136
between Volantis and Meereen.

231
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:57,845
It was all I could do
not to throw him in the sea.

232
00:18:01,595 --> 00:18:04,511
But the mind behind all those words...

233
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
He's made mistakes.

234
00:18:08,803 --> 00:18:10,261
Serious mistakes.

235
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:13,303
As have we all.

236
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,386
He owns his

237
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,720
and learns from them.

238
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:21,845
You're advising me to forgive the man

239
00:18:21,928 --> 00:18:23,178
who stole your position?

240
00:18:24,762 --> 00:18:25,845
I am.

241
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:29,011
And one other suggestion,

242
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:31,428
if you'll allow me.

243
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:33,969
The moment we can get
the last infantryman

244
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:36,511
out onto the field,
we should shut the gates.

245
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:38,678
Keep them open for as long as you can.

246
00:18:38,762 --> 00:18:41,678
There are still people coming in
from the countryside.

247
00:18:47,345 --> 00:18:49,969
Lady Sansa, I was hoping
we could speak alone.

248
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:09,178
I thought you and I

249
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:11,178
were on the verge of agreement before.

250
00:19:11,261 --> 00:19:12,261
About Ser Jaime.

251
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,803
Brienne has been loyal to me, always.

252
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,136
I trust her more than anyone.

253
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:23,219
I wish I could have that kind
of faith in my advisors.

254
00:19:24,261 --> 00:19:26,470
Tyrion is a good man.

255
00:19:26,553 --> 00:19:29,219
He was never anything
but decent towards me.

256
00:19:29,303 --> 00:19:33,345
I didn't ask him to be my Hand
simply because he was good.

257
00:19:33,428 --> 00:19:35,303
I asked him to be my Hand

258
00:19:35,386 --> 00:19:38,303
because he was good, and intelligent,

259
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,762
and ruthless when he had to be.

260
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:44,094
He never should have trusted Cersei.

261
00:19:45,178 --> 00:19:47,261
You never should have either.

262
00:19:50,762 --> 00:19:52,470
I thought he knew his sister.

263
00:19:54,303 --> 00:19:56,094
Families are complicated.

264
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,386
Ours certainly have been.

265
00:20:01,345 --> 00:20:03,637
A sad thing to have in common.

266
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,678
We have other things in common.

267
00:20:07,762 --> 00:20:09,845
We've both known what it means
to lead people

268
00:20:09,928 --> 00:20:13,303
who aren't inclined
to accept a woman's rule.

269
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:15,511
And we've both done
a damn good job of it,

270
00:20:15,595 --> 00:20:17,303
from what I can tell.

271
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:24,595
And yet, I can't help but feel
we're at odds with one another.

272
00:20:25,762 --> 00:20:26,845
Why is that?

273
00:20:31,303 --> 00:20:32,261
Your brother.

274
00:20:35,637 --> 00:20:37,428
He loves you, you know that.

275
00:20:39,094 --> 00:20:40,261
That bothers you.

276
00:20:40,345 --> 00:20:43,887
Men do stupid things for women.

277
00:20:43,969 --> 00:20:46,011
They're easily manipulated.

278
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:51,887
All my life, I've known one goal:

279
00:20:51,969 --> 00:20:53,428
the Iron Throne.

280
00:20:54,428 --> 00:20:55,887
Taking it back from the people

281
00:20:55,969 --> 00:20:59,011
who destroyed my family,
and almost destroyed yours.

282
00:20:59,094 --> 00:21:01,637
My war was against them.

283
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,303
Until I met Jon.

284
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,053
Now I'm here, half a world away,

285
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:12,595
fighting Jon's war alongside him.

286
00:21:12,678 --> 00:21:15,845
Tell me, who manipulated whom?

287
00:21:23,553 --> 00:21:27,637
I should have thanked you
the moment you arrived.

288
00:21:28,969 --> 00:21:30,345
That was a mistake.

289
00:21:33,178 --> 00:21:35,303
I'm here because I love your brother...

290
00:21:36,969 --> 00:21:39,011
and I trust him...

291
00:21:39,094 --> 00:21:42,303
and I know he's true to his word.

292
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:44,094
He's only the second man in my life

293
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,762
I can say that about.

294
00:21:47,553 --> 00:21:48,803
Who was the first?

295
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:50,637
Someone taller.

296
00:21:55,887 --> 00:21:58,178
And what happens afterwards?

297
00:21:59,678 --> 00:22:03,094
We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei.

298
00:22:04,303 --> 00:22:05,720
What happens then?

299
00:22:07,303 --> 00:22:08,887
I take the Iron Throne.

300
00:22:11,845 --> 00:22:13,094
What about the North?

301
00:22:14,386 --> 00:22:16,303
It was taken from us,

302
00:22:16,386 --> 00:22:18,094
and we took it back.

303
00:22:18,178 --> 00:22:21,803
And we said we'd never bow
to anyone else again.

304
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:23,428
What about the North?

305
00:22:30,762 --> 00:22:33,678
Apologies, my lady.
Your Grace...

306
00:22:33,762 --> 00:22:35,428
What is it?

307
00:22:57,178 --> 00:22:58,887
My queen.

308
00:22:58,969 --> 00:23:00,303
Your sister?

309
00:23:00,386 --> 00:23:02,345
She only has a few ships,

310
00:23:02,428 --> 00:23:03,887
and she couldn't sail them here.

311
00:23:03,969 --> 00:23:07,011
So she's sailing
to the Iron Islands instead,

312
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,928
to take them back in your name.

313
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:10,470
But why aren't you with her?

314
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,595
I want to fight for Winterfell,
Lady Sansa...

315
00:23:21,595 --> 00:23:23,345
if you'll have me.

316
00:23:53,637 --> 00:23:55,136
Milord, we're not soldiers.

317
00:23:55,219 --> 00:23:56,511
You are now.

318
00:24:00,845 --> 00:24:03,428
Look, I made it through
most of my years

319
00:24:03,511 --> 00:24:05,345
without ever getting near a fight,

320
00:24:05,428 --> 00:24:07,803
but then I survived
the Battle of the Bastards.

321
00:24:07,887 --> 00:24:09,386
Right outside these walls.

322
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,887
If I can live through that,
you can live through this.

323
00:24:14,428 --> 00:24:17,261
They'll outfit you with weapons
at the forge.

324
00:24:17,345 --> 00:24:18,345
Right that way.

325
00:24:20,178 --> 00:24:21,386
Thank you.

326
00:24:23,136 --> 00:24:25,678
When the time comes,
you'll be down in the crypts.

327
00:24:25,762 --> 00:24:27,261
They're the safest place to be.

328
00:24:27,345 --> 00:24:29,345
Through that archway right over there.

329
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:31,178
Thank you.

330
00:24:33,845 --> 00:24:36,261
Hey, hey, who's next, lads?

331
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:39,511
Thank you, sir.
Come back!

332
00:24:39,595 --> 00:24:41,386
Which way should I go?

333
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:48,470
Which way do you want to go?

334
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,803
All the children will be going below

335
00:24:50,887 --> 00:24:53,136
when the time comes.

336
00:24:53,219 --> 00:24:55,720
But both me brothers were soldiers.

337
00:24:57,678 --> 00:24:59,887
I want to fight too.

338
00:25:04,386 --> 00:25:06,303
That's good to hear.

339
00:25:06,386 --> 00:25:08,303
I'm going to be in the crypt
with my son,

340
00:25:08,386 --> 00:25:10,511
and I'd feel a lot better
with you down there

341
00:25:10,595 --> 00:25:13,969
- to protect us.
- I'm sure a lot of people would.

342
00:25:19,637 --> 00:25:22,094
All right.
I'll defend the crypt, then.

343
00:25:33,428 --> 00:25:35,053
Riders coming in!

344
00:25:58,219 --> 00:26:00,219
My little crow.

345
00:26:00,303 --> 00:26:01,511
I thought we'd lost you.

346
00:26:02,553 --> 00:26:03,969
Almost.

347
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:10,803
Put them in the stables.

348
00:26:14,053 --> 00:26:15,553
How did you find each other?

349
00:26:15,637 --> 00:26:17,595
We met up at the Last Hearth.

350
00:26:17,678 --> 00:26:19,511
The dead got there first.

351
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:24,887
The Umbers?

352
00:26:24,969 --> 00:26:26,969
Fighting for the Night King now.

353
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:30,720
We had to travel around them
to get here.

354
00:26:30,803 --> 00:26:33,386
Whoever's not here now

355
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,678
is with them.

356
00:26:34,762 --> 00:26:37,595
How long do we have?

357
00:26:37,678 --> 00:26:40,386
Before the sun comes up tomorrow.

358
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,511
The big woman still here?

359
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:53,762
They're coming.

360
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:54,845
Next.

361
00:26:54,928 --> 00:26:56,928
We have dragonglass

362
00:26:57,011 --> 00:26:59,136
and Valyrian steel.

363
00:27:03,345 --> 00:27:05,219
But there are too many of them.

364
00:27:06,428 --> 00:27:07,595
Far too many.

365
00:27:09,678 --> 00:27:11,511
Our enemy doesn't tire.

366
00:27:13,762 --> 00:27:14,845
Doesn't stop.

367
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:17,553
Doesn't feel.

368
00:27:18,969 --> 00:27:22,053
We can't beat them in a straight fight.

369
00:27:22,136 --> 00:27:23,678
So, what can we do?

370
00:27:25,386 --> 00:27:28,595
The Night King made them all.
They follow his command.

371
00:27:29,637 --> 00:27:30,762
If he falls...

372
00:27:32,386 --> 00:27:34,178
Getting to him may be our best chance.

373
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:36,887
If that's true,
he'll never expose himself.

374
00:27:37,845 --> 00:27:38,928
Yes, he will.

375
00:27:40,219 --> 00:27:41,762
He'll come for me.

376
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:47,219
He's tried before, many times,
with many Three-Eyed Ravens.

377
00:27:48,303 --> 00:27:49,261
Why?

378
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:51,553
What does he want?

379
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:53,219
An endless night.

380
00:27:54,845 --> 00:27:58,803
He wants to erase this world,
and I am its memory.

381
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:01,094
That's what death is, isn't it?

382
00:28:03,136 --> 00:28:04,261
Forgetting.

383
00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:08,219
Being forgotten.

384
00:28:09,261 --> 00:28:10,762
If we forget where we've been

385
00:28:10,845 --> 00:28:11,887
and what we've done,

386
00:28:11,969 --> 00:28:13,637
we're not men anymore.

387
00:28:14,678 --> 00:28:16,511
Just animals.

388
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,428
Your memories don't come from books.

389
00:28:19,595 --> 00:28:21,595
Your stories aren't just stories.

390
00:28:21,678 --> 00:28:24,178
If I wanted to erase the world of men,

391
00:28:24,261 --> 00:28:25,386
I'd start with you.

392
00:28:26,428 --> 00:28:27,470
How will he find you?

393
00:28:27,553 --> 00:28:29,428
His mark is on me.

394
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:32,969
He always knows where I am.

395
00:28:33,053 --> 00:28:34,553
We'll put you in the crypt,

396
00:28:34,637 --> 00:28:36,887
- where it's safest.
- No.

397
00:28:36,969 --> 00:28:38,553
We need to lure him into the open

398
00:28:38,637 --> 00:28:40,386
before his army destroys us all.

399
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,386
I'll wait for him in the Godswood.

400
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,345
You want us to use you as bait?

401
00:28:44,428 --> 00:28:46,219
We're not leaving you alone out there.

402
00:28:46,303 --> 00:28:48,011
He won't be.
I'll stay with him.

403
00:28:49,178 --> 00:28:50,637
With the Ironborn.

404
00:28:53,511 --> 00:28:55,928
I took this castle from you.

405
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:57,637
Let me defend you now.

406
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:09,219
We'll hold off the rest of them
for as long as we can.

407
00:29:09,303 --> 00:29:10,553
When the time comes,

408
00:29:10,637 --> 00:29:12,386
Ser Davos and I will be on the walls,

409
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,428
to give you the signal
to light the trench.

410
00:29:14,511 --> 00:29:18,053
Ser Davos is perfectly capable
of waving a torch on his own.

411
00:29:18,136 --> 00:29:20,345
You'll be in the crypt.

412
00:29:20,428 --> 00:29:22,261
Your Grace, I have fought before,

413
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:23,428
I can do it again.

414
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,011
Alongside the men and women

415
00:29:25,094 --> 00:29:26,053
risking their lives.

416
00:29:26,136 --> 00:29:27,762
There are thousands of them

417
00:29:27,845 --> 00:29:29,428
and only one of you.

418
00:29:29,511 --> 00:29:31,136
You can't fight as well as they can,

419
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:33,762
but you can think
better than any of them.

420
00:29:33,845 --> 00:29:36,261
You're here because of your mind.

421
00:29:36,345 --> 00:29:38,136
If we survive, I'll need it.

422
00:29:41,261 --> 00:29:43,928
The dragons should give us
an edge in the field.

423
00:29:44,011 --> 00:29:47,553
If they're in the field,
they're not protecting Bran.

424
00:29:47,637 --> 00:29:49,094
We need to be near him.

425
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:50,053
Not too near,

426
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:51,428
or the Night King won't come.

427
00:29:51,511 --> 00:29:53,720
But close enough to pursue him
when he does.

428
00:29:53,803 --> 00:29:55,762
Dragonfire will stop him?

429
00:29:55,845 --> 00:29:57,553
I don't know.

430
00:29:57,637 --> 00:29:59,219
No one's ever tried.

431
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,553
We're all going to die.

432
00:30:09,887 --> 00:30:12,345
But at least we die together.

433
00:30:16,053 --> 00:30:17,720
Let's get some rest.

434
00:30:26,511 --> 00:30:27,511
Your Grace.

435
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,678
Do you need help?

436
00:30:44,762 --> 00:30:46,053
No.

437
00:30:47,094 --> 00:30:49,261
You've had a strange journey.

438
00:30:49,345 --> 00:30:50,720
Stranger than most.

439
00:30:52,887 --> 00:30:54,928
I'd like to hear about it.

440
00:30:57,553 --> 00:30:59,511
It's a long story.

441
00:30:59,595 --> 00:31:01,595
If only we were trapped in a castle...

442
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:06,428
in the middle of winter,
with nowhere to go.

443
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,428
Hello.

444
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:52,053
When Daenerys takes her throne...

445
00:31:52,136 --> 00:31:54,136
there will be no place for us here.

446
00:31:55,303 --> 00:31:57,678
I am loyal to my queen.

447
00:31:57,762 --> 00:32:00,803
I will fight for her
until her enemies are defeated,

448
00:32:00,887 --> 00:32:04,637
but when the war is over
and she has won...

449
00:32:07,637 --> 00:32:10,470
...do you want
to grow old in this place?

450
00:32:12,928 --> 00:32:15,595
Is there nothing else you want to do,

451
00:32:15,678 --> 00:32:17,803
nothing else you want to see?

452
00:32:19,887 --> 00:32:21,011
Naath.

453
00:32:22,303 --> 00:32:24,845
I'd like to see the beaches again.

454
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,219
Then I will take you there.

455
00:32:29,303 --> 00:32:31,053
My people are peaceful.

456
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:34,720
We cannot protect ourselves.

457
00:32:34,803 --> 00:32:36,887
My people are not peaceful.

458
00:32:37,803 --> 00:32:39,345
We will protect you.

459
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,720
Yes, sir.

460
00:32:56,011 --> 00:32:57,887
Have you told her yet?

461
00:33:01,053 --> 00:33:02,053
No.

462
00:33:03,386 --> 00:33:04,553
Mm-hmm.

463
00:33:05,762 --> 00:33:06,928
Being careful.

464
00:33:10,219 --> 00:33:11,553
Biding your time.

465
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,553
Waiting for the perfect...

466
00:33:27,511 --> 00:33:29,553
And now our watch begins.

467
00:33:34,219 --> 00:33:35,969
Gilly? Little Sam?

468
00:33:37,845 --> 00:33:40,595
They'll be safe down in the crypt.

469
00:33:42,303 --> 00:33:43,762
If you want to join them...

470
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,887
To protect them.

471
00:33:49,969 --> 00:33:51,553
Everyone seems to forget that I was

472
00:33:51,637 --> 00:33:53,011
the first man to kill a White Walker.

473
00:33:53,094 --> 00:33:55,178
- I've killed Thenns.
- Thenn.

474
00:33:55,261 --> 00:33:56,720
I've saved Gilly more than once.

475
00:33:56,803 --> 00:33:58,678
I stole a considerable number of books

476
00:33:58,762 --> 00:33:59,928
from the Citadel library,

477
00:34:00,011 --> 00:34:02,470
survived the Fist of the First Men.

478
00:34:02,553 --> 00:34:04,720
You need me out there.

479
00:34:04,803 --> 00:34:06,345
Well, if that's what it's come to,

480
00:34:06,428 --> 00:34:08,928
- we really are fucked.
- Well, calling you "fucked"

481
00:34:09,011 --> 00:34:10,595
wouldn't be strictly accurate.

482
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,053
Samwell Tarly.

483
00:34:16,136 --> 00:34:18,720
Slayer of White Walkers.

484
00:34:18,803 --> 00:34:20,470
Lover of Ladies.

485
00:34:21,928 --> 00:34:23,511
As if we needed any more signs

486
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:24,678
the world was ending.

487
00:34:26,928 --> 00:34:28,595
Think back to where we started.

488
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:34,595
Us, Grenn, Pyp.

489
00:34:36,136 --> 00:34:38,511
Now it's just us three.

490
00:34:38,595 --> 00:34:42,261
Last man left, burn the rest of us.

491
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,303
I wish Father were here.

492
00:35:01,928 --> 00:35:03,887
I would love to see
the look on his face

493
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,595
when he realizes his two sons

494
00:35:05,678 --> 00:35:08,011
are about to die defending Winterfell.

495
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,637
That would be something to see.

496
00:35:20,845 --> 00:35:24,011
I remember the first time we were here,

497
00:35:24,094 --> 00:35:25,928
the first time I saw this hall.

498
00:35:26,011 --> 00:35:26,928
Mm.

499
00:35:27,011 --> 00:35:28,553
You were a golden lion.

500
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,428
I was a drunken whoremonger.

501
00:35:32,511 --> 00:35:33,803
It was all so simple.

502
00:35:35,011 --> 00:35:37,219
It wasn't so simple.

503
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:38,762
I was sleeping with my sister

504
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,470
and you had one friend in the world

505
00:35:41,553 --> 00:35:43,053
who was sleeping with his sister.

506
00:35:43,136 --> 00:35:45,386
I was speaking in relative terms.

507
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,845
- Do you miss it?
- Of course I miss it.

508
00:35:51,386 --> 00:35:53,470
Well, my golden-lion days are done,

509
00:35:53,553 --> 00:35:56,219
but whoremongering
is still an option for you.

510
00:35:57,345 --> 00:35:58,386
It's not.

511
00:35:59,887 --> 00:36:02,762
Things would be easier if it were.

512
00:36:05,637 --> 00:36:07,553
The perils of self-betterment.

513
00:36:13,053 --> 00:36:14,969
Oh!

514
00:36:15,053 --> 00:36:16,553
My lady.

515
00:36:16,637 --> 00:36:18,511
Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt.

516
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:20,678
We were just looking for
somewhere warm to...

517
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,553
To contemplate your imminent death.

518
00:36:22,637 --> 00:36:24,470
You've come to the right place.

519
00:36:24,553 --> 00:36:26,969
You want some of this piss?
It's not bad.

520
00:36:27,053 --> 00:36:29,345
- It's not good either.
- Thank you, milord.

521
00:36:29,428 --> 00:36:31,345
I don't think that's wise.

522
00:36:31,428 --> 00:36:33,928
The battle might start at any moment.

523
00:36:36,678 --> 00:36:37,803
Half cup.

524
00:36:39,887 --> 00:36:41,845
- And you?
- No, thank you.

525
00:36:41,928 --> 00:36:43,428
I should try and get some sleep.

526
00:36:43,511 --> 00:36:45,094
You really think any of us

527
00:36:45,178 --> 00:36:46,595
are going to sleep tonight?

528
00:36:47,845 --> 00:36:49,053
Join us.

529
00:36:50,928 --> 00:36:52,178
All right.

530
00:36:52,261 --> 00:36:53,595
Just a bit.

531
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:01,678
Well, what do we have here?

532
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,053
Ser Davos, join us.

533
00:37:03,136 --> 00:37:04,219
No, not for me, thanks.

534
00:37:04,303 --> 00:37:05,678
Came here for this.

535
00:37:05,762 --> 00:37:08,136
I figured I could wait to die

536
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:11,136
freezing my balls off out there

537
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:14,011
or wait to die nice and warm in here.

538
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:20,261
It could be our last night
in this world, you know.

539
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,553
Yes, well, I'm glad you're here.

540
00:37:24,637 --> 00:37:26,386
Here fighting with us.

541
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,470
Glad you survived Eastwatch.

542
00:37:28,553 --> 00:37:30,178
Would you like a drink?

543
00:37:31,136 --> 00:37:32,178
Brought my own.

544
00:37:39,345 --> 00:37:41,345
They call you "King Killer."

545
00:37:42,345 --> 00:37:44,219
I'm sure someone does.

546
00:37:45,261 --> 00:37:47,345
They call me "Giantsbane."

547
00:37:48,678 --> 00:37:49,803
Want to know why?

548
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:03,470
I killed a giant when I was 10.

549
00:38:05,178 --> 00:38:08,845
Then I climbed right into bed
with his wife.

550
00:38:10,136 --> 00:38:13,637
When she woke up,
you know what she did?

551
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:21,428
Suckled me at her teat
for three months.

552
00:38:21,511 --> 00:38:23,345
Thought I was her baby.

553
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:26,553
That's how I got so strong.

554
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:29,720
Giant's milk.

555
00:38:44,053 --> 00:38:45,219
Mm.

556
00:38:48,053 --> 00:38:49,637
Maybe I will have that drink.

557
00:39:28,595 --> 00:39:29,845
You never used to shut up.

558
00:39:29,928 --> 00:39:32,386
Now you're just sitting there
like a mute.

559
00:39:35,678 --> 00:39:36,969
Guess I've changed.

560
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,762
What are you doing up here?

561
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:49,720
What's it look like?

562
00:39:49,803 --> 00:39:52,637
No, I mean, what are you doing up here?

563
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,678
You joined the Brotherhood.

564
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:58,386
You went beyond the Wall with Jon.

565
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,969
You're here now. Why?

566
00:40:01,928 --> 00:40:03,053
When was the last time

567
00:40:03,136 --> 00:40:05,345
you fought for anyone but yourself?

568
00:40:08,053 --> 00:40:10,136
I fought for you, didn't I?

569
00:40:20,303 --> 00:40:22,386
Oh, for fuck's sake.

570
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,303
May as well be at a bloody wedding.

571
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:28,678
My lady.

572
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:30,845
It's good to see you again.

573
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:33,303
I'm sorry we parted the way we did.

574
00:40:34,511 --> 00:40:36,053
Was he on your list?

575
00:40:37,136 --> 00:40:38,345
For a little while.

576
00:40:39,428 --> 00:40:40,678
That's all right.

577
00:40:42,511 --> 00:40:45,470
The Lord of Light has brought us
together all the same.

578
00:40:47,595 --> 00:40:49,553
This is his moment.

579
00:40:49,637 --> 00:40:51,678
- When light...
- Thoros isn't here anymore,

580
00:40:51,762 --> 00:40:54,595
so I hope you're not
about to give a sermon.

581
00:40:54,678 --> 00:40:56,136
Because if you are,

582
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:59,428
the Lord of Light's gonna wonder
why he brought you back 19 times

583
00:40:59,511 --> 00:41:01,011
just to watch you die when I chuck you

584
00:41:01,094 --> 00:41:03,345
over this fucking wall.

585
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,887
Where are you going?

586
00:41:19,428 --> 00:41:21,094
I'm not spending my final hours

587
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,219
with you two miserable old shits.

588
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,053
That for me?

589
00:42:03,136 --> 00:42:04,762
This'll work.

590
00:42:08,136 --> 00:42:09,345
Last time you saw me,

591
00:42:09,428 --> 00:42:11,261
you wanted me to come to Winterfell.

592
00:42:12,345 --> 00:42:13,720
Took the long road, but...

593
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,553
What did the Red Woman want with you?

594
00:42:22,011 --> 00:42:25,511
She wanted my blood
for some kind of spell.

595
00:42:25,595 --> 00:42:27,094
Why your blood?

596
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,386
I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.

597
00:42:32,011 --> 00:42:34,094
I didn't know until she told me.

598
00:42:34,178 --> 00:42:36,386
Then she tied me up, stripped me down,

599
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,845
put leeches all over me.

600
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:43,178
Was that your first time?

601
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:45,969
No, yeah, I've never had leeches
put all over my cock.

602
00:42:46,053 --> 00:42:48,011
Your first time with a woman.

603
00:42:48,094 --> 00:42:49,887
What?

604
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:52,428
I... I didn't...
I wasn't with her.

605
00:42:52,511 --> 00:42:55,887
Were you with other girls
before that in King's Landing?

606
00:42:55,969 --> 00:42:57,637
Or after?

607
00:43:01,762 --> 00:43:03,595
You don't remember?

608
00:43:05,303 --> 00:43:07,261
- Yes, I was.
- One?

609
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,720
Two?

610
00:43:09,803 --> 00:43:12,345
- Twenty?
- Well, I didn't keep count.

611
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,261
Yes, you did.

612
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,178
Three.

613
00:43:25,845 --> 00:43:28,345
We're probably going to die soon.

614
00:43:30,969 --> 00:43:33,678
I want to know what it's like
before that happens.

615
00:43:39,969 --> 00:43:41,386
Arya, I...

616
00:44:17,511 --> 00:44:19,678
I'm not the Red Woman.

617
00:44:19,762 --> 00:44:21,428
Take your own bloody pants off.

618
00:44:46,219 --> 00:44:48,428
It's strange, isn't it?

619
00:44:50,928 --> 00:44:54,136
Almost everyone here's
fought the Starks

620
00:44:54,219 --> 00:44:56,345
at one time or another.

621
00:44:56,428 --> 00:45:00,969
And here we are in their castle,
ready to defend it.

622
00:45:01,053 --> 00:45:02,261
Together.

623
00:45:05,094 --> 00:45:07,094
At least we'll die with honor.

624
00:45:12,928 --> 00:45:14,511
I think we might live.

625
00:45:18,178 --> 00:45:19,762
I... I do.

626
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:24,136
How many battles
have we survived between us?

627
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:26,803
Ser Davos Seaworth.

628
00:45:27,762 --> 00:45:29,803
Survivor of both the Blackwater

629
00:45:29,887 --> 00:45:31,969
and the Battle of the Bastards.

630
00:45:32,053 --> 00:45:33,178
All without a shred

631
00:45:33,261 --> 00:45:35,094
- of combat ability.
- Mm.

632
00:45:35,178 --> 00:45:39,136
Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero
of the Siege of Pyke.

633
00:45:39,219 --> 00:45:41,887
Fabled loser of the Battle
of Whispering Wood.

634
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:42,969
Hear, hear!

635
00:45:44,345 --> 00:45:45,969
Ser Brienne of Tarth.

636
00:45:46,053 --> 00:45:48,178
Defeated the Hound in...

637
00:45:49,136 --> 00:45:51,386
Pardon me, Lady Brienne.

638
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:53,511
She's not a ser?

639
00:45:53,595 --> 00:45:54,678
You're not a knight?

640
00:45:56,136 --> 00:45:57,511
Women can't be knights.

641
00:45:57,595 --> 00:45:59,595
- Why not?
- Tradition.

642
00:45:59,678 --> 00:46:00,762
Fuck tradition.

643
00:46:02,011 --> 00:46:04,637
I don't even want to be a knight.

644
00:46:08,261 --> 00:46:09,345
I'm no king.

645
00:46:09,428 --> 00:46:11,720
But if I were,

646
00:46:11,803 --> 00:46:14,553
I'd knight you 10 times over.

647
00:46:16,553 --> 00:46:18,178
You don't need a king.

648
00:46:19,345 --> 00:46:22,303
Any knight can make another knight.

649
00:46:27,261 --> 00:46:28,303
I'll prove it.

650
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:34,011
Kneel, Lady Brienne.

651
00:46:37,887 --> 00:46:40,011
Do you want to be a knight or not?

652
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:45,803
Kneel.

653
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:41,094
In the name of the Warrior,

654
00:47:42,053 --> 00:47:43,762
I charge you to be brave.

655
00:47:46,053 --> 00:47:48,094
In the name of the Father,

656
00:47:49,553 --> 00:47:51,386
I charge you to be just.

657
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:56,261
In the name of the Mother,

658
00:47:56,345 --> 00:47:59,595
I charge you to defend the innocent.

659
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,845
Arise, Brienne of Tarth...

660
00:48:12,303 --> 00:48:14,762
a knight of the Seven Kingdoms.

661
00:48:31,969 --> 00:48:33,762
Ser Brienne of Tarth!

662
00:48:35,136 --> 00:48:36,969
Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!

663
00:48:46,887 --> 00:48:48,887
We have all we need to win this war.

664
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:51,470
I have trained my men,
women and children.

665
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,428
I have fought before.
I can fight again.

666
00:48:53,511 --> 00:48:56,678
Please, listen to me.
You're the future of our house.

667
00:48:56,762 --> 00:48:58,678
I don't need you to remind me of that.

668
00:48:58,762 --> 00:49:01,762
You'll be safer in the crypt.
These things we're fighting...

669
00:49:01,845 --> 00:49:03,386
I will not hide underground.

670
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:05,261
I pledged to fight for the North,

671
00:49:05,345 --> 00:49:07,928
- and I will fight.
- I'm meant to relieve you.

672
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,887
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

673
00:49:12,637 --> 00:49:14,969
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

674
00:49:15,053 --> 00:49:16,136
It's all right.

675
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:18,720
We're done here.

676
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:26,678
I wish you good fortune, cousin.

677
00:49:28,595 --> 00:49:29,887
Thank you, my lady.

678
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:32,428
- My lady.
- My lady.

679
00:49:37,303 --> 00:49:38,553
What have you got there?

680
00:49:40,219 --> 00:49:41,553
It's called Heartsbane.

681
00:49:42,887 --> 00:49:44,969
It's my family sword.

682
00:49:45,053 --> 00:49:46,553
You still have a family.

683
00:49:47,803 --> 00:49:50,553
Yes. And I'd love
to defend them with it.

684
00:49:52,595 --> 00:49:54,762
But I can't really hold it upright.

685
00:49:57,219 --> 00:50:00,511
Your father,
he taught me how to be a man.

686
00:50:02,011 --> 00:50:03,511
How to do what's right.

687
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,011
This is right.

688
00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:13,386
It's Valyrian steel.

689
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:16,969
I'd be honored if you'd take it.

690
00:50:30,219 --> 00:50:31,928
I'll wield it in his memory...

691
00:50:36,303 --> 00:50:38,595
to guard the realms of men.

692
00:50:41,261 --> 00:50:43,470
I'll see you when it's through.

693
00:50:55,303 --> 00:50:57,178
I hope we win.

694
00:51:05,845 --> 00:51:08,803
- We'd better get some rest.
- No, let's stay a bit longer.

695
00:51:08,887 --> 00:51:10,094
We're out of wine.

696
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:17,803
How about a song?

697
00:51:19,345 --> 00:51:21,011
One of you must know one.

698
00:51:21,928 --> 00:51:23,219
Ser Davos?

699
00:51:23,303 --> 00:51:25,803
You'll pray for a quick death.

700
00:51:28,845 --> 00:51:30,136
Ser Brienne?

701
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:37,094
Mm-mm.

702
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:38,678

Lyanna Stark.

721
00:53:55,511 --> 00:53:57,261
My brother Rhaegar...

722
00:54:00,386 --> 00:54:04,303
everyone told me
he was decent and kind.

723
00:54:04,386 --> 00:54:05,637
He liked to sing.

724
00:54:06,803 --> 00:54:08,928
Gave money to poor children.

725
00:54:11,762 --> 00:54:13,094
And he raped her.

726
00:54:14,637 --> 00:54:15,678
He didn't.

727
00:54:20,303 --> 00:54:21,303
He loved her.

728
00:54:27,845 --> 00:54:30,136
They were married in secret.

729
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,428
After Rhaegar fell on the Trident,

730
00:54:33,511 --> 00:54:34,470
she had a son.

731
00:54:36,553 --> 00:54:38,094
Robert would have murdered the baby

732
00:54:38,178 --> 00:54:40,386
if he ever found out,
and Lyanna knew it.

733
00:54:42,136 --> 00:54:43,678
So the last thing she did...

734
00:54:45,178 --> 00:54:47,261
as she bled to death
on her birthing bed

735
00:54:47,345 --> 00:54:49,303
was give the boy to her brother...

736
00:54:50,803 --> 00:54:52,178
Ned Stark...

737
00:54:54,011 --> 00:54:55,845
to raise as his bastard.

738
00:54:59,511 --> 00:55:00,720
My name...

739
00:55:03,136 --> 00:55:04,511
my real name...

740
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,428
is Aegon Targaryen.

741
00:55:12,303 --> 00:55:14,428
- That's impossible.
- I wish it were.

742
00:55:16,178 --> 00:55:17,345
Who told you this?

743
00:55:18,428 --> 00:55:19,386
Bran.

744
00:55:20,553 --> 00:55:22,553
- He saw it.
- He saw it?

745
00:55:22,637 --> 00:55:25,219
And Samwell confirmed it.

746
00:55:25,303 --> 00:55:27,428
He read about their marriage
at the Citadel

747
00:55:27,511 --> 00:55:29,386
without even knowing what it meant.

748
00:55:30,553 --> 00:55:33,261
A secret no one in the world knew...

749
00:55:33,345 --> 00:55:36,428
except your brother
and your best friend.

750
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,178
Doesn't seem strange to you?

751
00:55:41,887 --> 00:55:43,386
It's true, Dany.

752
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:46,261
I know it is.

753
00:55:50,969 --> 00:55:53,011
If it were true,

754
00:55:53,094 --> 00:55:57,136
it would make you the last
male heir of House Targaryen.

755
00:56:02,261 --> 00:56:04,261
You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne.

756
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,803
Form up!

757
00:56:18,928 --> 00:56:20,887
