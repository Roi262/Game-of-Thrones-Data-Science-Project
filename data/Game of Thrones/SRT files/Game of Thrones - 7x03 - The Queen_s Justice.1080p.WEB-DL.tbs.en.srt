1
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:15,068


2
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,072
The bastard of Winterfell.

3
00:03:58,068 --> 00:04:00,089
The dwarf of Casterly Rock.

4
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:08,027
I believe we last saw
each other atop the Wall.

5
00:04:08,027 --> 00:04:12,018
You were pissing off the edge
if I remember right.

6
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,064
Picked up some scars
along the road.

7
00:04:14,064 --> 00:04:19,014
It's been a long road,
but we're both still here.

8
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:22,064
I'm Tyrion Lannister.

9
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:26,047
- Davos Seaworth.
- Ah, the Onion Knight.

10
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:29,056
We fought on opposite sides at
the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

11
00:04:29,056 --> 00:04:32,014
Unluckily for me.

12
00:04:32,014 --> 00:04:35,018
Missandei is the queen's
most trusted advisor.

13
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:38,056
Welcome to Dragonstone.

14
00:04:38,056 --> 00:04:40,039
Our queen knows
it is a long journey.

15
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:43,077
She appreciates the efforts
you have made on her behalf.

16
00:04:43,077 --> 00:04:46,052
If you wouldn't mind
handing over your weapons.

17
00:04:52,014 --> 00:04:53,052
Of course.

18
00:05:18,014 --> 00:05:19,068
Please, this way.

19
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:26,002
Where are you from?

20
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:28,031
I can't place the accent.

21
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:30,014
I was born on
the Island of Naath.

22
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:33,023
Ah. I hear it's
beautiful down there.

23
00:05:33,023 --> 00:05:35,031
Palm trees and butterflies.

24
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:36,073
Haven't been, myself.

25
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,068
This place has changed.

26
00:05:49,006 --> 00:05:52,018
And Sansa? I hear
she's alive and well.

27
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,068
- She is.
- Does she miss me terribly?

28
00:05:57,085 --> 00:06:00,027
A sham marriage.
And unconsummated.

29
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:03,043
- I didn't ask.
- Well, it was. Wasn't.

30
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:05,035
Anyway...

31
00:06:05,035 --> 00:06:08,018
she's much smarter
than she lets on.

32
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:10,056
She's starting to let on.

33
00:06:10,056 --> 00:06:11,048
Good.

34
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:13,052
At some point,

35
00:06:13,052 --> 00:06:17,047
I want to hear how a Night's Watch
recruit became King in the North.

36
00:06:17,048 --> 00:06:19,027
As long as you tell me
how a Lannister

37
00:06:19,027 --> 00:06:22,006
became Hand
to Daenerys Targaryen.

38
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,018
A long and bloody tale.

39
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:26,093
To be honest,
I was drunk for most of it.

40
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:32,010
My bannermen think
I'm a fool for coming here.

41
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,052
Of course they do.

42
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:36,023
If I was your Hand, I would
have advised against it.

43
00:06:38,085 --> 00:06:40,077
General rule of thumb--

44
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:43,089
Stark men don't fare well
when they travel south.

45
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:45,064
True...

46
00:06:45,064 --> 00:06:47,077
but I'm not a Stark.

47
00:07:02,002 --> 00:07:03,027
I'd say you get used to them...

48
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:07,048
but you never really do.

49
00:07:11,002 --> 00:07:14,027
Come, their mother
is waiting for you.

50
00:07:26,064 --> 00:07:30,023
I wondered why you weren't
there to meet our guests.

51
00:07:30,023 --> 00:07:33,023
You begged us to summon
the King in the North.

52
00:07:33,023 --> 00:07:35,068
Don't you want to see him again?

53
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:38,031
I've done my part.

54
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:40,072
I've brought
ice and fire together.

55
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:43,002
Strange.

56
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:45,052
You spoke so highly of Jon Snow,

57
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:49,018
but when he arrives,
you hide on a cliff.

58
00:07:49,018 --> 00:07:51,056
I didn't take you
for a bashful girl.

59
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:55,077
My time whispering in the ears
of kings has come to an end.

60
00:07:55,077 --> 00:07:58,018
Oh, I doubt that.

61
00:07:58,018 --> 00:08:00,081
Give us common folk
one taste of power,

62
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:03,064
we're like the lion
who tasted man.

63
00:08:03,064 --> 00:08:06,089
Nothing is ever so sweet again.

64
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:10,014
Neither of us
is common folk anymore.

65
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:14,006
I did not part on good terms

66
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:17,006
with the King in the North
or his advisor.

67
00:08:17,006 --> 00:08:18,006
Why?

68
00:08:19,073 --> 00:08:21,077
Because of mistakes I made.

69
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:25,077
Terrible mistakes.

70
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,072
I would only be
a distraction if I stayed.

71
00:08:30,073 --> 00:08:32,093
- So, where will you go?
- Volantis.

72
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:34,093
Good.

73
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:37,018
If you don't mind my saying,

74
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:40,093
I don't think you should
return to Westeros.

75
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:43,039
I'm not sure you'd be safe here.

76
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:48,052
Oh, I will return, dear Spider.

77
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:50,031
- One last time.
- My lady--

78
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:53,089
I have to die
in this strange country.

79
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:55,073
Just like you.

80
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:39,060
You stand in the presence

81
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,039
of Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen,

82
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,060
rightful heir
to the Iron Throne,

83
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,056
rightful Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

84
00:09:47,056 --> 00:09:49,098
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms,

85
00:09:49,098 --> 00:09:51,068
the Mother of Dragons,

86
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:53,089
the Khaleesi
of the Great Grass Sea,

87
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:57,068
the Unburnt,
the Breaker of Chains.

88
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:04,048
This is Jon Snow.

89
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:10,027
He's King in the North.

90
00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:15,014
Thank you for traveling
so far, my lord.

91
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,039
I hope the seas
weren't too rough.

92
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,098
The winds were kind, Your Grace.

93
00:10:18,098 --> 00:10:22,098
Apologies, I have a Flea
Bottom accent, I know,

94
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:25,085
but Jon Snow is King in
the North, Your Grace.

95
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:27,068
- He's not a lord.
- Forgive me--

96
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:29,093
Your Grace, this is
Ser Davos Seaworth.

97
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:31,085
Forgive me, Ser Davos.

98
00:10:31,085 --> 00:10:34,047
I never did receive
a formal education,

99
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:35,081
but I could have sworn I read

100
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:39,010
the last King in the
North was Torrhen Stark,

101
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,027
who bent the knee to my
ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.

102
00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:45,047
In exchange for his life
and the lives of the Northmen,

103
00:10:45,048 --> 00:10:50,052
Torrhen Stark swore fealty to
House Targaryen in perpetuity.

104
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:52,002
Or do I have my facts wrong?

105
00:10:52,002 --> 00:10:54,035
I wasn't there, Your Grace.

106
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:56,077
No, of course not.

107
00:10:56,077 --> 00:10:59,035
But still, an oath is an oath.

108
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:01,077
And perpetuity means--

109
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,023
what does perpetuity mean,
Lord Tyrion?

110
00:11:04,023 --> 00:11:05,072
Forever.

111
00:11:05,073 --> 00:11:07,081
Forever.

112
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:10,064
So I assume, my lord...

113
00:11:10,064 --> 00:11:12,085
...you're here
to bend the knee.

114
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,093
I am not.

115
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:20,006
Oh.

116
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:21,089
Well, that is unfortunate.

117
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:24,089
You've traveled all this way

118
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:27,006
to break faith
with House Targaryen?

119
00:11:27,006 --> 00:11:29,056
Break faith?

120
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,089
Your father burned
my grandfather alive.

121
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:33,060
He burned my uncle alive.

122
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,093
He would have burned
the Seven Kingdoms--

123
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:38,002
My father...
was an evil man.

124
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:42,006
On behalf of House Targaryen...

125
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:44,093
I ask your forgiveness

126
00:11:44,093 --> 00:11:47,089
for the crimes he committed
against your family.

127
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:50,077
And I ask you
not to judge a daughter

128
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:53,014
by the sins of her father.

129
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,010
Our two houses
were allies for centuries,

130
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,098
and those were
the best centuries

131
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:02,010
the Seven Kingdoms
have ever known.

132
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,060
Centuries of peace
and prosperity

133
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,043
with a Targaryen
sitting on the Iron Throne

134
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:11,043
and a Stark serving
as Warden of the North.

135
00:12:11,043 --> 00:12:15,018
I am the last Targaryen,
Jon Snow.

136
00:12:15,018 --> 00:12:17,060
Honor the pledge
your ancestor made to mine.

137
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,027
Bend the knee and I will name
you Warden of the North.

138
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:23,047
Together, we will
save this country

139
00:12:23,048 --> 00:12:26,010
from those who would destroy it.

140
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:37,098
You're right.

141
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:40,047
You're not guilty
of your father's crimes.

142
00:12:40,048 --> 00:12:45,031
And I'm not beholden
to my ancestor's vows.

143
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,031
Then why are you here?

144
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:50,014
Because I need your help,
and you need mine.

145
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:55,031
Did you see three dragons

146
00:12:55,031 --> 00:12:57,027
flying overhead
when you arrived?

147
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,035
I did.

148
00:12:58,035 --> 00:13:00,064
And did you see the Dothraki,

149
00:13:00,064 --> 00:13:02,085
all of whom have sworn
to kill for me?

150
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:04,081
They're hard to miss.

151
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:08,085
- But still, I need your help?
- Not to defeat Cersei.

152
00:13:08,085 --> 00:13:12,018
You could storm King's Landing
tomorrow and the city would fall.

153
00:13:12,018 --> 00:13:14,043
Hell, we almost took it and
we didn't even have dragons.

154
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:18,056
- Almost.
- But you haven't stormed King's Landing.

155
00:13:18,056 --> 00:13:20,018
Why not?

156
00:13:20,018 --> 00:13:21,089
The only reason I can see

157
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:24,014
is you don't want to kill
thousands of innocent people.

158
00:13:24,014 --> 00:13:26,018
It's the fastest way
to win the war,

159
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:28,002
but you won't do it,

160
00:13:28,002 --> 00:13:31,023
which means, at the very least,

161
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:32,068
you're better than Cersei.

162
00:13:34,018 --> 00:13:37,056
Still, that doesn't explain
why I need your help.

163
00:13:39,043 --> 00:13:44,006
Because right now, you and I
and Cersei and everyone else,

164
00:13:44,006 --> 00:13:45,068
we're children
playing at a game,

165
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:47,077
screaming that
the rules aren't fair.

166
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:49,089
- You told me you liked this man.
- I do.

167
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:53,039
In the time since he's met me,
he's refused to call me queen,

168
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,027
he's refused to bow, and now
he's calling me a child.

169
00:13:56,027 --> 00:14:00,006
I believe he's calling all of us children.
Figure of speech.

170
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,039
Your Grace, everyone you know
will die before winter's over

171
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,056
if we don't defeat
the enemy to the north.

172
00:14:05,056 --> 00:14:08,023
As far as I can see, you are
the enemy to the north.

173
00:14:08,023 --> 00:14:09,089
I am not your enemy.

174
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:13,023
The dead are the enemy.

175
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:14,077
The dead?

176
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:17,064
Is that another
figure of speech?

177
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,027
The Army of the Dead
is on the march.

178
00:14:19,027 --> 00:14:21,035
The Army of the Dead?

179
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:23,052
You don't know me well, my lord,

180
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:26,085
but do you think
I'm a liar or a madman?

181
00:14:26,085 --> 00:14:29,039
No, I don't think
you're either of those things.

182
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:31,052
The Army of the Dead is real.

183
00:14:31,052 --> 00:14:32,098
The white walkers are real.

184
00:14:32,098 --> 00:14:35,089
The Night King is real.
I've seen them.

185
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:37,043
If they get past the Wall

186
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,093
and we're squabbling
amongst ourselves...

187
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:44,056
we're finished.

188
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,043
I was born at Dragonstone.

189
00:14:54,006 --> 00:14:56,077
Not that I can remember it.

190
00:14:56,077 --> 00:15:00,023
We fled before Robert's
assassins could find us.

191
00:15:00,023 --> 00:15:03,043
Robert was your father's
best friend, no?

192
00:15:03,043 --> 00:15:07,027
I wonder if your father knew
his best friend sent assassins

193
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:09,081
to murder a baby girl
in her crib.

194
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:13,018
Not that it matters now,
of course.

195
00:15:14,073 --> 00:15:18,027
I spent my life
in foreign lands.

196
00:15:18,027 --> 00:15:20,064
So many men
have tried to kill me,

197
00:15:20,064 --> 00:15:24,014
I don't remember
all their names.

198
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:28,023
I have been sold
like a broodmare.

199
00:15:28,023 --> 00:15:31,077
I've been chained and betrayed,

200
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:34,056
raped and defiled.

201
00:15:34,056 --> 00:15:36,081
Do you know
what kept me standing

202
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:39,077
through all those years
in exile?

203
00:15:39,077 --> 00:15:42,072
Faith.

204
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:44,098
Not in any gods,

205
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:48,052
not in myths and legends.

206
00:15:48,052 --> 00:15:51,014
In myself.

207
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:54,031
In Daenerys Targaryen.

208
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:57,085
The world hadn't seen
a dragon in centuries

209
00:15:57,085 --> 00:16:00,023
until my children were born.

210
00:16:00,023 --> 00:16:05,002
The Dothraki hadn't
crossed the sea, any sea.

211
00:16:05,002 --> 00:16:07,039
They did for me.

212
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,085
I was born to rule
the Seven Kingdoms,

213
00:16:11,085 --> 00:16:13,098
and I will.

214
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:18,085
You'll be ruling
over a graveyard

215
00:16:18,085 --> 00:16:21,018
if we don't defeat
the Night King.

216
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,081
The war against my sister
has already begun.

217
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:28,018
You can't expect us
to halt hostilities

218
00:16:28,018 --> 00:16:30,002
and join you in fighting

219
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:31,052
whatever you saw
beyond the Wall.

220
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:35,093
You don't believe him.

221
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:38,085
I understand that.
It sounds like nonsense.

222
00:16:38,085 --> 00:16:42,064
But if destiny has brought Daenerys
Targaryen back to our shores,

223
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:45,085
it has also made Jon Snow
King in the North.

224
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:48,098
You were the first to bring
Dothraki to Westeros?

225
00:16:48,098 --> 00:16:52,035
He is the first to make allies
of wildlings and Northmen.

226
00:16:52,035 --> 00:16:54,043
He was named Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

227
00:16:54,043 --> 00:16:55,052
He was named King in the North.

228
00:16:55,052 --> 00:16:56,089
Not because of his birthright.

229
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:59,027
He has no birthright.
He's a damn bastard.

230
00:16:59,027 --> 00:17:04,031
All those hard sons of bitches
chose him as their leader

231
00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:06,002
because they believe in him.

232
00:17:07,043 --> 00:17:09,039
All those things
you don't believe in,

233
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,093
he faced those things.

234
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:13,014
He fought those things
for the good of his people.

235
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:14,072
He risked his life
for his people.

236
00:17:14,073 --> 00:17:16,052
He took a knife in the
heart for his people.

237
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:18,027
He gave his own--

238
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,018
If we don't put aside our
enmities and band together,

239
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:29,027
we will die.

240
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:32,093
And then it doesn't matter whose
skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.

241
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:35,027
If it doesn't matter,
then you might as well kneel.

242
00:17:35,027 --> 00:17:37,043
Swear your allegiance
to Queen Daenerys,

243
00:17:37,043 --> 00:17:39,006
help her to defeat my sister,

244
00:17:39,006 --> 00:17:41,023
and together, our armies
will protect the North.

245
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:42,098
There's no time for that.

246
00:17:42,098 --> 00:17:44,089
There's no time for any of this!

247
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:46,039
While we stand here,
debating--

248
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:48,035
It takes no time
to bend the knee.

249
00:17:48,035 --> 00:17:50,018
Pledge your sword to her cause.

250
00:17:50,018 --> 00:17:51,093
And why would I do that?

251
00:17:54,081 --> 00:17:56,093
I mean no offense, Your Grace,

252
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:58,014
but I don't know you.

253
00:17:58,014 --> 00:17:59,098
As far as I can tell,

254
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:03,027
your claim to the throne rests
entirely on your father's name,

255
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:06,060
and my own father fought
to overthrow the Mad King.

256
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:10,039
The lords of the North

257
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:13,023
placed their trust
in me to lead them,

258
00:18:13,023 --> 00:18:17,027
and I will continue to
do so as well as I can.

259
00:18:18,052 --> 00:18:19,098
That's fair.

260
00:18:21,048 --> 00:18:23,035
It's also fair to point out

261
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:27,047
that I'm the rightful
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

262
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:31,023
By declaring yourself king
of the northernmost kingdom,

263
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:33,014
you are in open rebellion.

264
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,043
Your Grace,
please dismiss your guests.

265
00:18:45,043 --> 00:18:47,052
I have grave news.

266
00:18:50,006 --> 00:18:51,093
You must forgive my manners.

267
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:54,031
You'll both be tired
after your long journey.

268
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:57,006
We'll have baths drawn for you
and supper sent to your rooms.

269
00:19:06,052 --> 00:19:07,085
Am I your prisoner?

270
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:13,014
Not yet.

271
00:19:30,056 --> 00:19:32,027
Our ironborn and Dornish allies

272
00:19:32,027 --> 00:19:33,072
were attacked en route to Dorne.

273
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:36,023
- And?
- Two or three ships escaped,

274
00:19:36,023 --> 00:19:38,056
the rest, sunk or captured.

275
00:19:38,056 --> 00:19:41,014
Ellaria and the Sand Snakes,
dead or captured.

276
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,072
The Greyjoys, dead or captured.

277
00:19:43,073 --> 00:19:45,043
All of them?

278
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:50,056
- Pull!
- Heave!

279
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:51,093
Pull!

280
00:20:02,018 --> 00:20:03,064
Your sister's dead?

281
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:07,018
Euron has her.

282
00:20:07,018 --> 00:20:08,056
You saw him take her?

283
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:14,023
- But you got away?
- I couldn't save her.

284
00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:15,073
I tried.

285
00:20:17,002 --> 00:20:19,010
You wouldn't be here
if you tried.

286
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,047
Come, men!

287
00:20:25,048 --> 00:20:26,081
Sails up!

288
00:20:35,043 --> 00:20:37,043
Murderer!

289
00:20:48,018 --> 00:20:50,031
Whores!

290
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:52,064
Traitor!

291
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:57,077
This is the life.

292
00:20:58,098 --> 00:21:02,064
Look at them,
cheering for a Greyjoy.

293
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,056
I have to be honest,

294
00:21:08,056 --> 00:21:10,052
this is making me hard.

295
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:15,023
Did you see Little Theon's face

296
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,060
right before
he jumped overboard?

297
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,014
"Oh, no!"

298
00:21:20,014 --> 00:21:21,060
What a twat.

299
00:21:49,035 --> 00:21:52,031
- Whore! Whore! Whore!
- Murderers!

300
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,093
My queen, please
accept this gift

301
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:32,077
on behalf of all of your loyal
subjects in the Iron Islands.

302
00:22:37,073 --> 00:22:41,093
I give you what no
other man could give--

303
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:44,006
justice.

304
00:22:44,006 --> 00:22:47,073
Justice for your
murdered daughter.

305
00:22:57,027 --> 00:23:01,027
You've proven yourself the greatest
captain on the fourteen seas

306
00:23:01,027 --> 00:23:03,093
and a true friend to the crown.

307
00:23:03,093 --> 00:23:07,014
You deserve more
than a true friend.

308
00:23:07,014 --> 00:23:10,064
And you deserve a proper
reward for your heroism.

309
00:23:10,064 --> 00:23:13,031
There's only one reward I want.

310
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,031
You shall have
what your heart desires...

311
00:23:19,035 --> 00:23:20,089
when the war is won.

312
00:23:27,027 --> 00:23:30,072
With Euron Greyjoy
commanding our naval forces

313
00:23:30,073 --> 00:23:33,089
and Jaime Lannister
leading our armies,

314
00:23:33,089 --> 00:23:35,093
the sons and daughters
of Westeros

315
00:23:35,093 --> 00:23:38,023
shall defend our country.

316
00:23:44,073 --> 00:23:47,047
There's nothing quite
like it, is there?

317
00:23:47,048 --> 00:23:49,023
The love of the people.

318
00:23:49,023 --> 00:23:51,035
Though I suppose
you wouldn't know.

319
00:23:51,035 --> 00:23:54,068
This same mob spat at
my sister not long ago.

320
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:56,043
And if you turn on us,

321
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:59,064
they'll cheer to see your
head mounted on a spike.

322
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:01,014
Or yours.

323
00:24:01,014 --> 00:24:04,027
They just like
severed heads, really.

324
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:07,052
Listen, if you have
any advice at all,

325
00:24:07,052 --> 00:24:09,010
I would love to hear it.

326
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:12,014
When we have an hour or two
to speak as brothers.

327
00:24:12,014 --> 00:24:13,085
Advice?

328
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:17,052
Does she like it
gentle or rough?

329
00:24:17,052 --> 00:24:19,018
A finger in the bum?

330
00:24:19,018 --> 00:24:22,048
Shh, shh, shh, shh, not now.
We'll talk later.

331
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:43,027
I want you to know I understand.

332
00:24:43,027 --> 00:24:44,085
Even though we're
enemies, you and I,

333
00:24:44,085 --> 00:24:46,052
I understand the fury
that drives you.

334
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,002
I was there that day

335
00:24:49,002 --> 00:24:50,081
when Ser Gregor crushed
your lover's head.

336
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:55,068
If I close my eyes,

337
00:24:55,068 --> 00:24:58,068
I can hear the sound
of Oberyn's skull breaking.

338
00:24:58,068 --> 00:25:00,089
The sound of your scream.

339
00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:02,039
I never heard a sound like that.

340
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,035
I thought,
"That's true love."

341
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:08,023
Oberyn looked beautiful that day.
He really did.

342
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:09,060
No one moved like him.

343
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:12,072
No one had such skill
with a spear.

344
00:25:12,073 --> 00:25:15,081
Even Ser Gregor
couldn't stop him.

345
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:18,027
If only he hadn't taunted him.

346
00:25:18,027 --> 00:25:22,023
He could've walked away and
left poor Ser Gregor to die.

347
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:24,027
But that wasn't
your lover's way, was it?

348
00:25:24,027 --> 00:25:27,010
Now he's buried somewhere.

349
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,085
And here's Ser Gregor,
stronger than ever.

350
00:25:29,085 --> 00:25:31,077
That must be difficult for you.

351
00:25:35,073 --> 00:25:37,072
When my daughter
was taken from me,

352
00:25:37,073 --> 00:25:40,085
my only daughter...

353
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:43,064
well, you can't
imagine how that feels

354
00:25:43,064 --> 00:25:45,089
unless you've lost a child.

355
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:48,056
I fed her at my own breast
even though they told me

356
00:25:48,056 --> 00:25:51,027
to give her to the wet nurse.

357
00:25:51,027 --> 00:25:54,077
I couldn't bear to see her
in another woman's arms.

358
00:25:54,077 --> 00:25:57,002
I never got to have a mother,

359
00:25:57,002 --> 00:25:58,043
but Myrcella did.

360
00:25:58,043 --> 00:26:02,010
She was mine,
and you took her from me.

361
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,014
Why did you do that?

362
00:26:10,073 --> 00:26:12,010
Doesn't matter now.

363
00:26:20,068 --> 00:26:23,043
Your daughter's a beauty, too.

364
00:26:23,043 --> 00:26:26,006
Those brown eyes.

365
00:26:26,006 --> 00:26:27,077
Those lips.

366
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,043
Perfect Dornish beauty.

367
00:26:31,043 --> 00:26:33,031
I imagine she's your favorite.

368
00:26:33,031 --> 00:26:36,047
I know, I know, we're not
supposed to have favorites,

369
00:26:36,048 --> 00:26:38,064
but still, we're only human.

370
00:26:40,014 --> 00:26:41,072
We love whom we love.

371
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,060
I'm sorry,
I can't understand you.

372
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,098
That gag makes it impossible to
understand what you're saying.

373
00:26:49,098 --> 00:26:51,081
It must be frustrating.

374
00:26:54,098 --> 00:26:57,098
We all make our choices.

375
00:26:57,098 --> 00:27:00,039
You chose to murder my daughter.

376
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:02,064
You must have felt powerful
after you made that choice.

377
00:27:02,064 --> 00:27:04,085
Do you feel powerful now?

378
00:27:11,043 --> 00:27:12,081
I don't sleep very well.

379
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:15,018
Not at all, really.

380
00:27:15,018 --> 00:27:17,010
I lie in bed
and I stare at the canopy

381
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,047
and imagine ways
of killing my enemies.

382
00:27:19,048 --> 00:27:23,035
How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the
woman who murdered my only daughter.

383
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:26,052
I thought about
having Ser Gregor

384
00:27:26,052 --> 00:27:28,068
crush your skull
the way he did Oberyn's.

385
00:27:28,068 --> 00:27:33,039
It would be poetic, I
suppose, but fast, too fast.

386
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,035
I thought about having him
crush your daughter's skull.

387
00:27:37,043 --> 00:27:39,018
She's so beautiful.

388
00:27:40,043 --> 00:27:42,010
The thought of this lovely face

389
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,052
cracking open like a duck egg,

390
00:27:44,052 --> 00:27:46,027
no, it's just not right.

391
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:54,085
Mama.

392
00:28:05,023 --> 00:28:07,056
Qyburn here is
the cleverest man I know.

393
00:28:07,056 --> 00:28:10,064
Clever enough to learn what poison
you used to murder Myrcella.

394
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:12,031
The Long Goodbye, was that it?

395
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:14,039
- The Long Farewell.
- That's the one.

396
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:20,023
How long does the poison take?

397
00:28:20,023 --> 00:28:22,089
Difficult to
say-- hours, days.

398
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:24,077
It depends on the
subject's constitution.

399
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:28,027
- But death is certain?
- Oh, yes, Your Grace, quite certain.

400
00:28:33,064 --> 00:28:36,052
Your daughter will die
here in this cell,

401
00:28:36,052 --> 00:28:39,064
and you will be here
watching when she does.

402
00:28:39,064 --> 00:28:42,043
You'll be here
the rest of your days.

403
00:28:44,031 --> 00:28:48,027
If you refuse to eat, we'll
force food down your throat.

404
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:51,098
You will live to watch
your daughter rot.

405
00:28:51,098 --> 00:28:55,027
To watch that beautiful face collapse...

406
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:57,039
...to bone and dust.

407
00:28:59,077 --> 00:29:02,073
All the while contemplating
the choices you've made.

408
00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:08,043
Make sure the guards change
the torches every few hours.

409
00:29:08,043 --> 00:29:09,085
I don't want her
to miss a thing.

410
00:29:40,085 --> 00:29:42,010
No.

411
00:30:24,035 --> 00:30:25,035
Don't.

412
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,023
What are you doing?
No one can see us like this.

413
00:30:40,023 --> 00:30:43,089
I am the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
I'll do as I please.

414
00:30:49,043 --> 00:30:50,056
Forgive me, Your Grace.

415
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,089
The visitor from Braavos
has arrived.

416
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:55,089
Good. And we'll need
fresh sheets for the bed.

417
00:30:55,089 --> 00:30:57,023
At once, Your Grace.

418
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:10,047
No, thank you.

419
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:12,018
My condolences, Your Grace,

420
00:31:12,018 --> 00:31:14,014
on the death of your son.

421
00:31:14,014 --> 00:31:16,085
From all reports,
he was a fine young man.

422
00:31:16,085 --> 00:31:19,060
The Iron Bank didn't send you
here to offer condolences.

423
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:23,010
Condolences and congratulations.

424
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,006
To become the first ruling
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,

425
00:31:26,006 --> 00:31:28,006
that's quite an accomplishment.

426
00:31:28,006 --> 00:31:31,085
The Iron Bank appreciates how you
cast off the yoke of superstition,

427
00:31:31,085 --> 00:31:33,043
freeing the crown from elements

428
00:31:33,043 --> 00:31:35,093
who sought to subvert
the rule of law.

429
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:39,010
The destruction of the Sept of
Baelor was a tragic accident.

430
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:43,031
Indeed, but sometimes
tragedies are necessary

431
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:45,068
to restore order
and rational leadership.

432
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:48,043
The Iron Bank
wants its gold back.

433
00:31:48,043 --> 00:31:51,002
Your father never
minced words either.

434
00:31:51,002 --> 00:31:54,085
But, yes, your debts
are considerable.

435
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:57,072
And you're now engaged in a
conflict on several fronts.

436
00:31:57,073 --> 00:32:00,064
We both know how
expensive war can be.

437
00:32:00,064 --> 00:32:02,085
And we both know gold wins wars.

438
00:32:02,085 --> 00:32:04,031
Your vaults are empty.

439
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:06,081
Your late husband's
profligacy saw to that.

440
00:32:06,081 --> 00:32:10,014
Your wealthiest allies, the
Tyrells, are now your enemies.

441
00:32:10,014 --> 00:32:13,072
You are surrounded on all sides
by rivals for the throne.

442
00:32:13,073 --> 00:32:15,068
And the Iron Bank
wants to bet on a winner.

443
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:17,039
We don't make bets.

444
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,098
We invest in endeavors we
deem likely to be successful.

445
00:32:20,098 --> 00:32:23,093
A fancy way
of saying "bet."

446
00:32:23,093 --> 00:32:27,068
The war's already begun.
I've drawn first blood.

447
00:32:27,068 --> 00:32:30,068
I decapitated the Dornish snake.

448
00:32:30,068 --> 00:32:32,072
My armada owns the Narrow Sea.

449
00:32:32,073 --> 00:32:35,018
Euron Greyjoy's armada
owns the Narrow Sea.

450
00:32:35,018 --> 00:32:36,068
Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.

451
00:32:36,068 --> 00:32:38,089
For now.

452
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:42,064
Daenerys Targaryen has
three full-grown dragons.

453
00:32:42,064 --> 00:32:46,098
How well do wooden ships fare
against fire-breathing dragons?

454
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:52,002
Her dragons might not be
as invulnerable as some think.

455
00:32:52,002 --> 00:32:54,039
But let's talk about
the Targaryen girl.

456
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,031
You want to invest in her?

457
00:32:56,031 --> 00:33:00,068
I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested
considerable gold in the slave trade.

458
00:33:00,068 --> 00:33:02,093
How are your profits

459
00:33:02,093 --> 00:33:05,047
now that Daenerys
has freed all the slaves?

460
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:09,064
The slave trade has entered
a downturn, it's true.

461
00:33:09,064 --> 00:33:11,052
From what I gather,
she considers herself

462
00:33:11,052 --> 00:33:14,085
more of a revolutionary
than a monarch.

463
00:33:14,085 --> 00:33:18,077
In your experience, how do bankers
usually fare with revolutionaries?

464
00:33:18,077 --> 00:33:21,077
The Lannisters owe the Iron
Bank quite a lot of money,

465
00:33:21,077 --> 00:33:23,093
but Lannisters
always pay their debts.

466
00:33:23,093 --> 00:33:28,035
Do former slaves
or Dothraki or dragons?

467
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:33,093
Your father's daughter, indeed.

468
00:33:33,093 --> 00:33:35,027
Give me a fortnight.

469
00:33:35,027 --> 00:33:37,047
Stay in King's Landing
as my honored guest.

470
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,089
And when you return to Braavos,

471
00:33:38,089 --> 00:33:43,035
I swear to you, my debt
will be paid in full.

472
00:34:06,098 --> 00:34:10,081
I came down here to brood over my
failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.

473
00:34:13,035 --> 00:34:14,089
You're making it difficult.

474
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:18,056
You look a lot better
brooding than I do.

475
00:34:20,027 --> 00:34:22,081
You make me feel like I'm failing
at brooding over failing.

476
00:34:22,081 --> 00:34:24,052
I'm a prisoner on this island.

477
00:34:24,052 --> 00:34:28,047
I wouldn't say you're
a prisoner on this island.

478
00:34:28,048 --> 00:34:29,098
You're free to walk the castle,

479
00:34:29,098 --> 00:34:31,089
the beaches,
to go wherever you want.

480
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:34,006
Except to my ship.

481
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:35,047
You took my ship.

482
00:34:35,048 --> 00:34:37,043
I wouldn't say
we took your ship.

483
00:34:37,043 --> 00:34:39,093
I'm not playing
word games with you.

484
00:34:39,093 --> 00:34:41,081
The dead are coming for us all.

485
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:43,047
Why don't you
figure out what to do

486
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:45,056
about my missing fleet
and murdered allies,

487
00:34:45,056 --> 00:34:48,043
and I'll figure out what to do
about your walking dead men.

488
00:34:48,043 --> 00:34:50,064
It's hard for me to fathom.
It really is.

489
00:34:50,064 --> 00:34:53,077
If someone told me about the white
walkers and the Night King...

490
00:35:01,018 --> 00:35:02,043
You probably don't believe me.

491
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:07,006
I do, actually.

492
00:35:07,006 --> 00:35:08,060
You didn't before.

493
00:35:10,031 --> 00:35:12,052
"Grumkins and snarks,"
you called them.

494
00:35:12,052 --> 00:35:14,060
Do you remember?

495
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,068
You said it was all nonsense.

496
00:35:16,068 --> 00:35:19,081
It was nonsense.
Everybody knew it.

497
00:35:19,081 --> 00:35:22,093
But then Mormont saw them

498
00:35:22,093 --> 00:35:24,035
and you saw them.

499
00:35:24,035 --> 00:35:26,002
And I trust the eyes
of an honest man

500
00:35:26,002 --> 00:35:28,002
more than I trust
what everybody knows.

501
00:35:29,035 --> 00:35:31,060
How do I convince people
who don't know me

502
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,035
that an enemy they don't believe
in is coming to kill them all?

503
00:35:34,035 --> 00:35:37,068
- Good question.
- I know it's a good question.

504
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,085
I'm looking for an answer.

505
00:35:39,085 --> 00:35:44,014
People's minds aren't made
for problems that large.

506
00:35:44,014 --> 00:35:46,060
White walkers, the Night King,

507
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,068
Army of the Dead--

508
00:35:48,068 --> 00:35:50,031
it's almost a relief to confront

509
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:53,018
a comfortable, familiar
monster like my sister.

510
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:58,048
I need to help prepare my
people for what's coming.

511
00:36:00,018 --> 00:36:02,052
I can't help them from here.

512
00:36:04,002 --> 00:36:05,027
I'd like to leave.

513
00:36:06,073 --> 00:36:09,023
It seems unlikely that
you became King in the North

514
00:36:09,023 --> 00:36:10,089
by giving up that easily.

515
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:16,018
Everyone told me to learn
from my father's mistakes.

516
00:36:16,018 --> 00:36:17,098
Don't go south.

517
00:36:17,098 --> 00:36:20,064
Don't answer a summons
from the Mad King's daughter,

518
00:36:20,064 --> 00:36:22,006
a foreign invader.

519
00:36:24,043 --> 00:36:27,014
And here I am,

520
00:36:27,014 --> 00:36:28,068
a Northern fool.

521
00:36:28,068 --> 00:36:31,014
Children are not their fathers,

522
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:32,085
luckily for all of us.

523
00:36:34,035 --> 00:36:36,056
And sometimes there's more
to foreign invaders

524
00:36:36,056 --> 00:36:38,077
and Northern fools
than meets the eye.

525
00:36:38,077 --> 00:36:42,098
Daenerys could have sailed for
Westeros long ago, but she didn't.

526
00:36:42,098 --> 00:36:44,081
Instead, she stayed
where she was

527
00:36:44,081 --> 00:36:47,047
and saved many people
from horrible fates,

528
00:36:47,048 --> 00:36:49,081
some of whom are on this
island with us right now.

529
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,039
While you're our guest here,

530
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,093
you might consider asking them

531
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:55,068
what they think
of the Mad King's daughter.

532
00:36:55,068 --> 00:36:58,077
She protects people
from monsters,

533
00:36:58,077 --> 00:37:00,031
just as you do.

534
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:02,077
It's why she came here.

535
00:37:02,077 --> 00:37:04,031
And she's not about
to head north

536
00:37:04,031 --> 00:37:05,077
to fight an enemy
she's never seen

537
00:37:05,077 --> 00:37:08,027
on the word of a man
she doesn't know.

538
00:37:08,027 --> 00:37:10,068
After a single meeting,

539
00:37:10,068 --> 00:37:13,048
it's not a reasonable
thing to ask.

540
00:37:19,085 --> 00:37:22,010
So, do you have anything
reasonable to ask?

541
00:37:26,093 --> 00:37:28,010
What do you mean?

542
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:30,035
Maybe you are a Northern fool.

543
00:37:30,035 --> 00:37:34,002
I'm asking if there's something
I can do to help you.

544
00:37:36,098 --> 00:37:38,052
- Dragonglass?
- Yes.

545
00:37:38,052 --> 00:37:40,098
Volcanic glass, obsidian.

546
00:37:40,098 --> 00:37:42,098
He says you have a tremendous
amount of it here.

547
00:37:42,098 --> 00:37:44,077
Why are we talking about glass?

548
00:37:44,077 --> 00:37:46,064
We just lost two of our allies.

549
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:50,002
Which is why I was speaking to
Jon Snow, a potential ally.

550
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:56,014
And what does the King in the
North want with dragonglass?

551
00:37:56,014 --> 00:37:58,047
Apparently, it can be
turned into weapons

552
00:37:58,048 --> 00:38:01,060
that kill white walkers
and their foot soldiers.

553
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,077
Or stop them.

554
00:38:03,077 --> 00:38:05,006
Destroy them.

555
00:38:05,006 --> 00:38:06,068
Unsure about the nomenclature.

556
00:38:08,064 --> 00:38:11,060
And what do you think
about this Army of the Dead

557
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:14,047
and white walkers
and Night Kings?

558
00:38:14,048 --> 00:38:17,010
I'd very much like to believe
that Jon Snow is wrong.

559
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:20,035
But a wise man once said that you
should never believe a thing

560
00:38:20,035 --> 00:38:22,089
simply because
you want to believe it.

561
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,077
Which wise man said this?

562
00:38:28,077 --> 00:38:30,064
I don't remember.

563
00:38:30,064 --> 00:38:34,006
Are you trying to present your own
statements as ancient wisdom?

564
00:38:35,027 --> 00:38:37,047
I would never do that.

565
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,052
To you.

566
00:38:40,035 --> 00:38:44,002
The reason I believe Jon
Snow is because he's here.

567
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:46,043
All of his advisors would
have told him not to come.

568
00:38:46,043 --> 00:38:48,052
I would have told him
not to come.

569
00:38:48,052 --> 00:38:50,085
And he's here anyway.

570
00:38:50,085 --> 00:38:53,027
You don't have to believe him.

571
00:38:53,027 --> 00:38:55,031
Let him mine the dragonglass.

572
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:56,093
If he's wrong, it's worthless.

573
00:38:56,093 --> 00:38:59,002
You didn't even know
it was here.

574
00:38:59,002 --> 00:39:01,056
It's nothing to you.

575
00:39:01,056 --> 00:39:04,085
Give him something
by giving him nothing.

576
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:07,056
Take a step toward a more
productive relationship

577
00:39:07,056 --> 00:39:10,014
with a possible ally.

578
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:13,052
Keep him occupied while we
focus on the task at hand--

579
00:39:13,052 --> 00:39:14,089
Casterly Rock.

580
00:39:16,014 --> 00:39:17,093
What was that Ser Davos said

581
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:21,098
about taking a knife in
the heart for his people?

582
00:39:21,098 --> 00:39:23,077
Did you notice that?

583
00:39:23,077 --> 00:39:26,023
You must allow them
their flights of fancy.

584
00:39:26,023 --> 00:39:28,039
It's dreary in the North.

585
00:39:44,027 --> 00:39:45,077
Amazing thing to see.

586
00:39:47,027 --> 00:39:50,031
I named them for my brothers,
Viserys and Rhaegar.

587
00:39:51,043 --> 00:39:52,093
They're both gone now.

588
00:39:55,023 --> 00:39:56,060
You lost two brothers as well.

589
00:39:59,077 --> 00:40:02,064
People thought dragons were gone
forever, but here they are.

590
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:07,023
Perhaps we should all be
examining what we think we know.

591
00:40:13,018 --> 00:40:15,047
You've been talking to Tyrion.

592
00:40:15,048 --> 00:40:18,023
He is my Hand.

593
00:40:18,023 --> 00:40:20,085
- He enjoys talking.
- We all enjoy what we're good at.

594
00:40:22,031 --> 00:40:23,081
I don't.

595
00:40:28,081 --> 00:40:31,081
You know I'm not going to let
Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.

596
00:40:31,081 --> 00:40:32,098
I never expected that you would.

597
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:34,023
And I haven't changed my mind

598
00:40:34,023 --> 00:40:36,031
about which kingdoms
belong to that throne.

599
00:40:36,031 --> 00:40:38,014
I haven't either.

600
00:40:47,048 --> 00:40:51,068
I will allow you to mine the
dragonglass and forge weapons from it.

601
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:54,068
Any resources or men you need,
I will provide for you.

602
00:40:58,018 --> 00:40:59,018
Thank you.

603
00:41:05,068 --> 00:41:09,035
So you believe me, then, about the
Night King and the Army of the Dead?

604
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:15,023
You'd better
get to work, Jon Snow.

605
00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:41,052
How much do we have?

606
00:41:41,052 --> 00:41:43,060
4,000 bushels, my lady.

607
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,077
What does that mean?

608
00:41:44,077 --> 00:41:46,085
For the current
occupants of the castle,

609
00:41:46,085 --> 00:41:50,052
it's enough food
for a year, perhaps more.

610
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:53,093
And what's the longest winter
in the past hundred years?

611
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:56,039
Uh, I'm not entirely certain.

612
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:58,023
I-I'll check
Maester Luwin's records.

613
00:41:58,023 --> 00:42:01,072
He kept a copy
of every raven scroll.

614
00:42:01,073 --> 00:42:03,085
You're telling me
we don't have enough food,

615
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:07,006
especially not if the armies of the
North come back to defend Winterfell?

616
00:42:08,031 --> 00:42:10,056
No, my lady, most likely not.

617
00:42:10,056 --> 00:42:12,068
Then we must prepare
for that eventuality.

618
00:42:12,068 --> 00:42:14,077
Whatever direction
the threat comes from,

619
00:42:14,077 --> 00:42:17,006
this is the best place to be.

620
00:42:17,006 --> 00:42:19,002
We need to start
building up our grain stores

621
00:42:19,002 --> 00:42:21,060
with regular shipments
from every keep in the North.

622
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,089
If we don't use it by winter's
end, we'll give it back to them.

623
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:26,023
But if the entire North
has to flee to Winterfell,

624
00:42:26,023 --> 00:42:29,093
they won't have enough time to bring
wagonloads of grain with them.

625
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:31,035
Very wise, my lady.

626
00:42:31,035 --> 00:42:33,014
Maester Wolkan,
you'll see to it?

627
00:42:36,093 --> 00:42:39,043
Are they covering those
breastplates in leather?

628
00:42:39,043 --> 00:42:40,081
No, my lady.

629
00:42:40,081 --> 00:42:43,089
Well, shouldn't they be?
Once the real cold comes?

630
00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:45,031
They should, indeed.

631
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:47,052
Pardon me, my lady.

632
00:42:47,052 --> 00:42:50,010
You there, why isn't
there leather on these?

633
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,089
Command suits you.

634
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,068
The Northerners
are all facing north,

635
00:42:57,068 --> 00:42:59,077
worried about the threat
from beyond the Wall.

636
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,031
So they should be.

637
00:43:01,031 --> 00:43:03,098
I know Cersei
better than anyone here.

638
00:43:03,098 --> 00:43:06,006
If you turn
your back on her--

639
00:43:06,006 --> 00:43:08,063
You don't know Cersei
better than anyone here.

640
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,046
I only meant to say--

641
00:43:10,058 --> 00:43:13,052
That the woman who murdered my mother,
father, and brother is dangerous?

642
00:43:13,052 --> 00:43:15,060
Thank you for your wise counsel.

643
00:43:16,089 --> 00:43:19,010
One of two things
will happen--

644
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,039
either the dead
will defeat the living,

645
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:23,035
in which case...

646
00:43:23,035 --> 00:43:25,043
all our troubles come to an end,

647
00:43:25,043 --> 00:43:27,081
or life will win out.

648
00:43:27,081 --> 00:43:29,081
And what then?

649
00:43:29,081 --> 00:43:33,081
Don't fight in the
North or the South.

650
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:40,027
Fight every battle, everywhere,
always, in your mind.

651
00:43:42,018 --> 00:43:44,006
Everyone is your enemy,

652
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:46,098
everyone is your friend...

653
00:43:46,098 --> 00:43:51,010
every possible series of events
is happening all at once.

654
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:54,068
Live that way and nothing
will surprise you.

655
00:43:54,068 --> 00:43:57,027
Everything that happens
will be something

656
00:43:57,027 --> 00:43:59,018
that you've seen before.

657
00:44:01,043 --> 00:44:04,018
Lady Sansa, at the gate.

658
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,089
Hello, Sansa.

659
00:44:58,077 --> 00:45:00,089
I wish Jon were here.

660
00:45:00,089 --> 00:45:03,077
Yes, I need to speak to him.

661
00:45:07,093 --> 00:45:10,056
You're Father's
last living trueborn son.

662
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:15,027
You're Lord of Winterfell now.

663
00:45:15,027 --> 00:45:18,052
I can never be
Lord of Winterfell.

664
00:45:18,052 --> 00:45:20,035
I can never be lord of anything.

665
00:45:20,035 --> 00:45:21,060
I'm the Three-Eyed Raven.

666
00:45:23,068 --> 00:45:25,047
I don't know what that means.

667
00:45:25,048 --> 00:45:27,089
It's difficult to explain.

668
00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:30,010
Try.
Please, for me.

669
00:45:31,081 --> 00:45:34,077
It means I can see everything.

670
00:45:34,077 --> 00:45:37,010
Everything that's ever
happened to everyone.

671
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:40,010
Everything that's
happening right now.

672
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:44,089
It's all pieces now, fragments.

673
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:47,010
I need to learn to see better.

674
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,052
When the Long Night comes again,

675
00:45:50,052 --> 00:45:52,014
I need to be ready.

676
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:57,060
How do you know all this?

677
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,014
The Three-Eyed Raven
taught me.

678
00:45:59,014 --> 00:46:01,006
I thought you were
the Three-Eyed Raven.

679
00:46:01,006 --> 00:46:03,081
I told you it's
difficult to explain.

680
00:46:05,098 --> 00:46:07,047
Bran--

681
00:46:07,048 --> 00:46:09,085
I'm sorry for all
that's happened to you.

682
00:46:09,085 --> 00:46:13,085
I'm sorry it had to
happen here in our home.

683
00:46:19,006 --> 00:46:21,014
It was so beautiful that night.

684
00:46:23,014 --> 00:46:27,014
Snow falling, just like now.

685
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:32,023
And you were so beautiful...

686
00:46:34,018 --> 00:46:35,098
in your white wedding dress.

687
00:46:39,085 --> 00:46:41,073
I have to go back inside, Bran.

688
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,081
I'll stay a bit longer.

689
00:46:58,052 --> 00:47:00,006
Hmm.

690
00:47:08,056 --> 00:47:10,039
Hmm.

691
00:47:15,085 --> 00:47:17,072
Does it hurt?

692
00:47:17,073 --> 00:47:20,043
A bit.
Less than before.

693
00:47:22,023 --> 00:47:24,085
The infection no longer
appears to be active.

694
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,027
Unusual.

695
00:47:28,027 --> 00:47:29,072
Unlikely.

696
00:47:29,073 --> 00:47:31,072
One could almost be forgiven

697
00:47:31,073 --> 00:47:35,031
for thinking that the entire upper
layer of diseased skin was debrided

698
00:47:35,031 --> 00:47:39,068
and the underlying region treated
with some sort of unguent.

699
00:47:39,068 --> 00:47:42,098
Don't know anything about that.

700
00:47:42,098 --> 00:47:45,006
I just started feeling better.

701
00:47:45,006 --> 00:47:48,073
I assumed it was
the rest that did it.

702
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:53,031
And the climate.

703
00:47:53,031 --> 00:47:55,027
The climate.

704
00:47:55,027 --> 00:47:57,006
You're free to go, ser.

705
00:47:57,006 --> 00:47:59,010
This chamber is needed
for the infectious,

706
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:00,081
which you are no longer.

707
00:48:00,081 --> 00:48:04,031
Tarly, I'd like to speak with
you in my study this evening.

708
00:48:07,027 --> 00:48:08,056
How bad is it?

709
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:11,060
Suppose I'll find out
this evening.

710
00:48:16,073 --> 00:48:19,043
Where will you go?

711
00:48:19,043 --> 00:48:23,014
I surrendered to this sickness
the moment I first saw it.

712
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,043
I knew it would kill me

713
00:48:27,043 --> 00:48:30,010
or I'd kill myself
before it could.

714
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:33,035
Daenerys Stormborn
convinced me otherwise.

715
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:36,098
The only place for me
is back with her.

716
00:48:36,098 --> 00:48:39,039
I owe her my life.

717
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:41,098
Her and you.

718
00:48:44,018 --> 00:48:46,052
Your father saved me
more than once.

719
00:48:46,052 --> 00:48:48,031
It's the least I could do.

720
00:48:49,081 --> 00:48:53,018
Perhaps our paths
will cross again.

721
00:48:53,018 --> 00:48:54,060
I hope they do.

722
00:49:21,073 --> 00:49:25,018
- You treated him?
- Yes.

723
00:49:25,018 --> 00:49:27,068
Who told you to treat him?

724
00:49:27,068 --> 00:49:29,002
No one.

725
00:49:29,002 --> 00:49:32,031
Who forbade you, or anyone,
to attempt to treat him?

726
00:49:32,031 --> 00:49:35,002
I seem to remember you.

727
00:49:35,002 --> 00:49:37,085
- But you treated him anyway?
- I did, yes.

728
00:49:39,052 --> 00:49:42,064
I forbade it because it is
dangerous and rarely successful,

729
00:49:42,064 --> 00:49:44,098
especially on
someone of that age.

730
00:49:44,098 --> 00:49:47,018
You could have infected
yourself and others.

731
00:49:47,018 --> 00:49:50,064
You could have devastated
the entire Citadel.

732
00:49:52,093 --> 00:49:54,085
But you didn't.

733
00:49:54,085 --> 00:49:57,047
It's a meticulous,
difficult procedure.

734
00:49:57,048 --> 00:50:00,089
Many maesters whose chains
are heavy with healing links

735
00:50:00,089 --> 00:50:03,035
have attempted it and failed.

736
00:50:03,035 --> 00:50:05,043
Yet you succeeded.

737
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,056
How?

738
00:50:08,056 --> 00:50:11,085
I read the books
and followed the instructions.

739
00:50:22,023 --> 00:50:24,043
That man is alive
because of you.

740
00:50:26,073 --> 00:50:28,035
You should be proud.

741
00:50:31,043 --> 00:50:33,093
Thank you, Archmaester.

742
00:50:33,093 --> 00:50:34,093
Come here.

743
00:50:38,089 --> 00:50:42,056
All these manuscripts
and scrolls are rotting away.

744
00:50:42,056 --> 00:50:45,023
I need you
to make copies of them.

745
00:50:49,052 --> 00:50:51,060
You were expecting a reward.

746
00:50:53,031 --> 00:50:57,010
Your reward is not being immediately
expelled from the Citadel.

747
00:50:58,027 --> 00:51:00,027
You'd better get started.

748
00:51:00,027 --> 00:51:01,093
And careful of the paper mites.

749
00:51:01,093 --> 00:51:03,027
They like flesh as well.

750
00:51:10,052 --> 00:51:13,089
We need to find Euron
Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.

751
00:51:13,089 --> 00:51:17,039
Your Grace, he's already destroyed
a good portion of our fleet.

752
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:18,093
To send our remaining
ships after him--

753
00:51:18,093 --> 00:51:21,060
I'm not talking about
sending our ships after him.

754
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:26,098
Would you have to go yourself?

755
00:51:26,098 --> 00:51:28,098
Euron's ships could be anywhere

756
00:51:28,098 --> 00:51:30,098
or in more than one place.

757
00:51:30,098 --> 00:51:33,039
You'd be flying around
the open seas alone

758
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:34,043
for who knows how long.

759
00:51:34,043 --> 00:51:36,006
I wouldn't be alone.

760
00:51:36,006 --> 00:51:38,064
I would have Drogon,
Viserion, and Rhaegal.

761
00:51:38,064 --> 00:51:40,043
What can anyone do to them?

762
00:51:40,043 --> 00:51:42,043
They can still
do something to you.

763
00:51:42,043 --> 00:51:44,023
It only takes one arrow.

764
00:51:44,023 --> 00:51:46,077
It's too great a risk.
You're too important.

765
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:51,023
What about Casterly Rock?

766
00:51:51,023 --> 00:51:53,018
The Unsullied
will be there soon.

767
00:51:53,018 --> 00:51:55,077
And what will they face?

768
00:51:55,077 --> 00:51:58,018
A difficult situation.

769
00:51:58,018 --> 00:52:00,031
They know we're coming.

770
00:52:00,031 --> 00:52:03,064
Yes. Cersei believes
my sole purpose in life

771
00:52:03,064 --> 00:52:05,027
is to destroy House Lannister.

772
00:52:05,027 --> 00:52:07,002
She will be ready.

773
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:13,064
- No one has ever taken the Rock.
- Archers!

774
00:52:13,064 --> 00:52:16,002
The Lannister Army is
still the army my father built.

775
00:52:16,002 --> 00:52:18,035
- Come on!
- Well-trained and well-provisioned.

776
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:20,014
10,000 men at least.

777
00:52:20,014 --> 00:52:21,014
They will see us coming.

778
00:52:25,068 --> 00:52:27,035
They will be ready.

779
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:32,068
- Draw! Loose!
- Loose!

780
00:52:34,089 --> 00:52:38,002
The gates of Casterly
Rock are impregnable.

781
00:52:45,073 --> 00:52:47,098
The fight up the walls
will be hard.

782
00:52:47,098 --> 00:52:49,052
We will be at a disadvantage.

783
00:52:50,089 --> 00:52:52,056
Many men will die.

784
00:52:54,073 --> 00:52:56,077
Just as my father
said they would.

785
00:52:58,093 --> 00:53:01,056
Interesting thing
about my father--

786
00:53:01,056 --> 00:53:03,047
he built our house up
from near ruin.

787
00:53:03,048 --> 00:53:07,064
He built our army, he built
Casterly Rock as we know it,

788
00:53:07,064 --> 00:53:09,072
but he didn't build the sewers.

789
00:53:09,073 --> 00:53:11,081
That was beneath him,

790
00:53:11,081 --> 00:53:14,068
so he gave the job to the
lowest person he could find--

791
00:53:14,068 --> 00:53:16,023
me.

792
00:53:16,023 --> 00:53:18,006
He was right, I was low.

793
00:53:18,006 --> 00:53:20,018
The company I kept, low.

794
00:53:20,018 --> 00:53:21,072
Women, mostly.

795
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:23,039
They weren't welcome
at the Rock.

796
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:25,068
Father disapproved
of that sort of behavior.

797
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:27,031
Couldn't walk them
through the front gates,

798
00:53:27,031 --> 00:53:28,077
I couldn't have them
in my chambers,

799
00:53:28,077 --> 00:53:31,002
so in the process
of building the sewers,

800
00:53:31,002 --> 00:53:33,077
I threw in something for myself.

801
00:53:35,081 --> 00:53:37,081
It was a passage that began

802
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:39,052
in an out of the way cove
by the sea

803
00:53:39,052 --> 00:53:42,093
and ended beneath
one of the main guard towers.

804
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:46,014
No better place for low pursuits
than beneath the ground.

805
00:53:47,077 --> 00:53:51,052
Casterly Rock
is an impregnable fortress.

806
00:53:53,077 --> 00:53:57,043
But as a good friend of mine
once said,

807
00:53:57,043 --> 00:54:01,039
"Give me 10 good men
and I'll impregnate the bitch."

808
00:54:06,093 --> 00:54:08,014
And so it begins.

809
00:54:14,089 --> 00:54:17,077
They will face the bulk
of the Lannister forces.

810
00:54:17,077 --> 00:54:19,064
They will be outnumbered.

811
00:54:19,064 --> 00:54:21,098
They will have less armor
and fewer weapons.

812
00:54:26,093 --> 00:54:30,072
But my sister's armies
fight for her out of fear.

813
00:54:30,073 --> 00:54:33,068
The Unsullied will be fighting
for something greater.

814
00:54:33,068 --> 00:54:35,068
They will be fighting
for freedom

815
00:54:35,068 --> 00:54:37,047
and the person
who gave it to them.

816
00:54:37,048 --> 00:54:39,098
They will be fighting for you.

817
00:54:39,098 --> 00:54:42,043
And that is why
they will triumph.

818
00:54:58,043 --> 00:55:00,018
_

819
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:03,085
_

820
00:55:05,004 --> 00:55:06,066
_

821
00:55:29,018 --> 00:55:30,039
Where are they?!

822
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:33,002
Where are the rest
of the Lannisters?

823
00:57:01,089 --> 00:57:04,014
- It's done.
- It is.

824
00:57:06,002 --> 00:57:10,014
And now the rains weep
o'er our halls.

825
00:57:12,048 --> 00:57:13,093
Did we fight well?

826
00:57:13,093 --> 00:57:16,098
Uh, as well
as could be expected.

827
00:57:16,098 --> 00:57:19,010
It was never our forte.

828
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:21,018
Golden roses, indeed.

829
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:25,014
Your brother and his new queen

830
00:57:25,014 --> 00:57:28,006
thought you would be
defending Casterly Rock.

831
00:57:28,006 --> 00:57:31,035
The truth is Casterly Rock
isn't worth much anymore.

832
00:57:31,035 --> 00:57:32,093
Well, it is to me,

833
00:57:32,093 --> 00:57:35,027
but my fond childhood memories

834
00:57:35,027 --> 00:57:36,081
won't keep Cersei on the throne.

835
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:38,093
So you just let them take it?

836
00:57:38,093 --> 00:57:40,098
For now. They won't
be able to hold it.

837
00:57:40,098 --> 00:57:43,052
Euron Greyjoy's navy
burned their ships,

838
00:57:43,052 --> 00:57:45,052
we emptied the larders
before we left.

839
00:57:45,052 --> 00:57:47,077
Eventually, they'll be forced
to abandon their position

840
00:57:47,077 --> 00:57:51,018
and march all the way
across Westeros.

841
00:57:51,018 --> 00:57:54,035
And you took your army,
your real army,

842
00:57:54,035 --> 00:57:56,023
and went where they weren't.

843
00:57:56,023 --> 00:57:59,056
As Robb Stark did to me
at Whispering Wood.

844
00:57:59,056 --> 00:58:01,060
There are always
lessons in failures.

845
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:05,018
Yes. You must be
very wise by now.

846
00:58:06,048 --> 00:58:09,035
My father always said
I was a slow learner.

847
00:58:09,035 --> 00:58:11,010
If he was so clever,

848
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:12,085
why didn't he take Highgarden

849
00:58:12,085 --> 00:58:16,056
the moment your
gold mines ran dry?

850
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:22,002
I suppose I'll be able to
ask him myself soon enough.

851
00:58:22,002 --> 00:58:25,010
No more learning
from my mistakes, eh?

852
00:58:27,056 --> 00:58:30,006
How will you do it?

853
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,052
With that sword?

854
00:58:32,052 --> 00:58:34,089
That was Joffrey's sword,
wasn't it?

855
00:58:34,089 --> 00:58:37,023
Not that he ever used it.

856
00:58:37,023 --> 00:58:38,089
What did he call it?

857
00:58:40,052 --> 00:58:42,085
Widow's Wail.

858
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:45,006
He really was a cunt, wasn't he?

859
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:52,006
I did unspeakable things
to protect my family.

860
00:58:52,006 --> 00:58:56,010
Or watched them
being done on my orders.

861
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:59,027
I never lost
a night's sleep over them.

862
00:58:59,027 --> 00:59:01,031
They were necessary.

863
00:59:01,031 --> 00:59:03,035
And whatever
I imagined necessary

864
00:59:03,035 --> 00:59:07,027
for the safety
of House Tyrell, I did.

865
00:59:07,027 --> 00:59:11,089
But your sister
has done things...

866
00:59:13,056 --> 00:59:15,089
I was incapable of imagining.

867
00:59:15,089 --> 00:59:18,072
That was
my prize mistake--

868
00:59:18,073 --> 00:59:21,027
a failure of imagination.

869
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:25,006
She's a monster,
you do know that?

870
00:59:25,006 --> 00:59:27,023
To you, I'm sure.

871
00:59:27,023 --> 00:59:29,010
To others as well.

872
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:32,060
But after we've won and there's
no one left to oppose us,

873
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:36,093
when people are living peacefully
in the world she built,

874
00:59:36,093 --> 00:59:40,064
do you really think they'll wring their
hands over the way she built it?

875
00:59:43,006 --> 00:59:45,027
You love her.

876
00:59:45,027 --> 00:59:47,006
You really do love her.

877
00:59:47,006 --> 00:59:49,052
You poor fool.

878
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:51,027
She'll be the end of you.

879
00:59:51,027 --> 00:59:53,081
Possibly.

880
00:59:53,081 --> 00:59:55,060
Not much to be gained

881
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:57,064
from discussing it with
you, though, is there?

882
00:59:57,064 --> 01:00:00,035
What better person
to discuss it with?

883
01:00:00,035 --> 01:00:02,027
What better guarantee
could you have

884
01:00:02,027 --> 01:00:06,031
that the things you say
will never leave this room?

885
01:00:06,031 --> 01:00:09,035
But perhaps you're right.

886
01:00:09,035 --> 01:00:10,093
If she's driven you this far,

887
01:00:10,093 --> 01:00:13,035
it's gone beyond your control.

888
01:00:14,064 --> 01:00:16,064
Yes.

889
01:00:16,064 --> 01:00:18,010
It has.

890
01:00:19,018 --> 01:00:21,023
She's a disease.

891
01:00:21,023 --> 01:00:24,018
I regret my role
in spreading it.

892
01:00:24,018 --> 01:00:25,077
You will, too.

893
01:00:25,077 --> 01:00:27,052
I think we're done here.

894
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:31,098
How will it happen?

895
01:00:33,052 --> 01:00:35,043
Cersei had several ideas.

896
01:00:35,043 --> 01:00:36,085
Whipping you through the streets

897
01:00:36,085 --> 01:00:39,052
and beheading you
in front of the Red Keep.

898
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:43,035
Flaying you alive and hanging you
from the walls of King's Landing.

899
01:00:46,052 --> 01:00:48,031
I talked her out of those.

900
01:01:05,056 --> 01:01:06,098
Will there be pain?

901
01:01:06,098 --> 01:01:09,056
No. I made sure
of that.

902
01:01:09,056 --> 01:01:10,089
That's good.

903
01:01:23,068 --> 01:01:25,068
I'd hate to die like your son.

904
01:01:26,089 --> 01:01:28,035
Clawing at my neck,

905
01:01:28,035 --> 01:01:31,023
foam and bile spilling
from my mouth,

906
01:01:31,023 --> 01:01:35,006
eyes bloodred, skin purple.

907
01:01:35,006 --> 01:01:37,043
Must have been horrible for you,

908
01:01:37,043 --> 01:01:40,089
as a Kingsguard, as a father.

909
01:01:40,089 --> 01:01:43,047
It was horrible enough for me.

910
01:01:43,048 --> 01:01:46,014
A shocking scene.

911
01:01:46,014 --> 01:01:48,093
Not at all what I intended.

912
01:01:50,089 --> 01:01:55,048
You see, I had never seen
the poison work before.

913
01:02:00,043 --> 01:02:02,060
Tell Cersei.

914
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:05,006
I want her to know it was me.

915
01:02:20,068 --> 01:02:31,031
