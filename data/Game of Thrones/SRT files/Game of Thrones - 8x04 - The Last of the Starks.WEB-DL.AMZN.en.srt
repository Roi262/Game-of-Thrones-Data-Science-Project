1
00:00:08,838 --> 00:00:10,254
Who would you say is the father?

2
00:00:10,672 --> 00:00:11,755
You.

3
00:00:12,797 --> 00:00:15,296
I'm going to put a prince
in your belly.

4
00:00:17,588 --> 00:00:21,046
Our queen has a keen sense
of poetic justice.

5
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:22,546
What would she do for the man

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,755
who rids her
of her treasonous brothers?

7
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,129
My name...
my real name...

8
00:00:28,797 --> 00:00:30,254
is Aegon Targaryen.

9
00:00:30,922 --> 00:00:32,004
It's true, Dany.

10
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:33,672
If it were true...

11
00:00:34,296 --> 00:00:35,755
you'd have a claim to the Iron Throne.

12
00:00:36,463 --> 00:00:38,463
She doesn't like your queen, does she?

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,505
She's defending our family.

14
00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:42,171
I'm her family, too.

15
00:00:43,713 --> 00:00:44,922
Don't forget that.

17
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:30,254
We're here to say goodbye
to our brothers and sisters.

18
00:05:31,254 --> 00:05:33,588
To our fathers and mothers.

19
00:05:35,421 --> 00:05:36,546
To our friends.

20
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,004
Our fellow men and women

21
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:42,713
who set aside their differences...

22
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:45,630
to fight together...

23
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:49,797
and die together

24
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,838
so that others might live.

25
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,755
Everyone in this world

26
00:05:56,838 --> 00:05:59,630
owes them a debt
that can never be repaid.

27
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:04,004
It is our duty and our honor

28
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:07,296
to keep them alive in memory...

29
00:06:08,463 --> 00:06:10,171
for those who come after us...

30
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,296
and those who come after them...

31
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:18,171
for as long as men draw breath.

32
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,588
They were the shields
that guarded the realms of men.

33
00:06:24,963 --> 00:06:27,797
And we shall never see
their like again.

34
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:00,922
To your health.

35
00:09:27,922 --> 00:09:29,380
Have you seen Arya?

36
00:09:30,922 --> 00:09:32,755
You can still smell the burning bodies,

37
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,338
and that's where your head is at.

38
00:09:34,421 --> 00:09:37,421
- I just want to thank her for--
- I'm sure you do.

39
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:38,755
Look, it's not about that.

40
00:09:38,838 --> 00:09:40,588
Of course it's about that, you twat.

41
00:09:40,672 --> 00:09:41,755
Why shouldn't it be?

42
00:09:41,838 --> 00:09:45,046
The dead are dead. You're not.

43
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,880
Gendry.

44
00:10:02,296 --> 00:10:03,713
That's right, isn't it?

45
00:10:10,213 --> 00:10:11,296
Yes, Your Grace.

46
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,588
You're Robert Baratheon's son.

47
00:10:19,963 --> 00:10:21,922
You are aware
he took my family's throne

48
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:24,338
and tried to have me murdered?

49
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:27,963
I didn't even know he was my
father until after he was dead.

50
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:31,254
Yes, he's dead.

51
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:32,922
His brothers are too.

52
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,046
So who's Lord of Storm's End now?

53
00:10:38,797 --> 00:10:40,046
I don't know, Your Grace.

54
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:41,963
Does anyone?

55
00:10:52,254 --> 00:10:54,630
I think you should be
Lord of Storm's End.

56
00:11:00,338 --> 00:11:01,588
I can't be. I'm a bastard.

57
00:11:01,672 --> 00:11:06,171
No, you are Lord
Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End,

58
00:11:06,254 --> 00:11:09,421
the lawful son of Robert Baratheon.

59
00:11:09,505 --> 00:11:12,254
Because that is what I have made you.

60
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:25,213
To Lord Gendry Baratheon
of Storm's End.

61
00:11:25,296 --> 00:11:27,505
To Gendry!

62
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:29,797
Lord Gendry!

63
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,797
Gendry!

64
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,296
- Gendry!
- Gendry!

65
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:37,963
Lord Gendry!

66
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:40,213
Gendry!

67
00:11:43,463 --> 00:11:45,254
That's easy, isn't it?

68
00:11:47,588 --> 00:11:50,713
- A fitting reward for a hero.
- Uh, hold on.

69
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:54,588
And a Lord of Storm's End
who will be forever loyal to you.

70
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,505
- Come, my lord.
- See?

71
00:11:56,588 --> 00:11:58,963
You're not the only one who's clever.

72
00:12:08,672 --> 00:12:11,630
I have to go down
and get another barrel.

73
00:12:14,963 --> 00:12:17,838
We fought dead things
and lived to talk about it.

74
00:12:17,922 --> 00:12:21,129
If this isn't the time to drink,
when is?

75
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:32,963
The last time I saw her,

76
00:12:33,046 --> 00:12:36,338
I told her I'd kill her
if I ever saw her again.

77
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:39,171
- I'm sure you had your reasons.
- I did.

78
00:12:39,254 --> 00:12:41,713
- I do.
- So did you?

79
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,797
Never got the chance.

80
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,380
She did it to herself.

81
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,546
Or her god did it to her.

82
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:55,755
Lord of Light.

83
00:12:55,838 --> 00:13:00,129
We play his game for him,
we fight his war and win,

84
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,838
and then

85
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:03,213
he fucks off.

86
00:13:03,296 --> 00:13:06,672
No signs, no blessings.
Who knows what he wants?

87
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:10,254
I don't imagine
thinking about that subject

88
00:13:10,338 --> 00:13:12,129
will leave you any happier than before.

89
00:13:12,213 --> 00:13:14,380
And what if I'm not trying to be happy?

90
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,838
Then you're in luck.

91
00:13:20,338 --> 00:13:22,755
We may have defeated them,

92
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:25,755
but we still have us to contend with.

93
00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:32,797
Thank you. I feel much better.

94
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:47,463
More ale!

95
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:51,380
This is clever.

96
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:55,254
Even better than the saddle
I designed for you.

97
00:13:56,588 --> 00:13:58,880
It's the same as the one
Daeron Targaryen built

98
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,630
for his crippled nephew 120 years ago.

99
00:14:02,713 --> 00:14:04,546
I liked that one.

100
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,797
You know our history
better than anyone.

101
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,004
That will be useful
as Lord of Winterfell.

102
00:14:11,088 --> 00:14:13,046
I'm not Lord of Winterfell.

103
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:16,129
You're the only surviving
trueborn son of Ned Stark.

104
00:14:21,004 --> 00:14:22,588
You don't want it.

105
00:14:22,672 --> 00:14:25,088
I don't really want anymore.

106
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:28,463
I envy you.

107
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:33,296
You shouldn't envy me.

108
00:14:34,797 --> 00:14:36,797
Mostly I live in the past.

109
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:43,588
- All of it.
- Go on.

110
00:14:43,672 --> 00:14:46,254
- No, not in one go.
- Go on. I believe in you.

111
00:14:46,338 --> 00:14:48,380
We have to celebrate our victory.

112
00:14:48,463 --> 00:14:50,755
Vomiting is not celebrating.

113
00:14:50,838 --> 00:14:52,630
Yes, it is.

114
00:14:52,713 --> 00:14:54,004
Ah!

115
00:14:54,088 --> 00:14:55,588
To the Dragon Queen!

116
00:14:58,004 --> 00:15:01,129
To Arya Stark, the hero of Winterfell!

117
00:15:04,713 --> 00:15:06,922
- Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah!
- Drink!

118
00:15:19,672 --> 00:15:21,505
I'm fine!

119
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
Your turn.

120
00:15:35,963 --> 00:15:37,546
Um...

121
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:41,546
You are an only child.

122
00:15:42,672 --> 00:15:44,296
- I told you I was.
- You didn't.

123
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,213
- I did.
- I surmised it.

124
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:48,838
Drink.

125
00:15:49,838 --> 00:15:51,088
Go again.

126
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:52,505
Why does he get to go again?

127
00:15:52,588 --> 00:15:54,463
Because it's my game.

128
00:15:54,546 --> 00:15:58,171
You have danced with Renly Baratheon.

129
00:16:00,213 --> 00:16:01,046
No.

130
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:02,505
Drink.

131
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,421
The other way around!

132
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:07,713
I saw him riding that thing.

133
00:16:07,797 --> 00:16:10,546
- We all did.
- No. No.

134
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,880
I saw him riding that thing.

135
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:15,963
- That's right, you did.
- I did.

136
00:16:16,046 --> 00:16:19,797
That's why we all agreed to follow him.

137
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,088
That's the kind of man he is.

138
00:16:23,838 --> 00:16:25,254
He's little...

139
00:16:26,254 --> 00:16:27,838
...but he's strong.

140
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:30,797
Strong enough to befriend an enemy

141
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,129
and get murdered for it!

142
00:16:33,213 --> 00:16:35,505
Most people get bloody murdered,

143
00:16:35,588 --> 00:16:36,797
they stay that way.

144
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,505
Not this one.

145
00:16:40,088 --> 00:16:42,296
Yeah, I didn't have much say in that.

146
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,421
Ah! He comes back
and keeps fighting.

147
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:49,004
Here, north of the Wall,
and then back here again.

148
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:52,546
He keeps fighting.
He keeps fighting.

149
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,546
He climbed on a fucking dragon
and fought.

150
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,213
What kind of person
climbs on a fucking dragon?

151
00:16:58,296 --> 00:17:01,546
A madman or a king!

152
00:17:16,129 --> 00:17:18,880
- Drink.
- Drink.

153
00:17:18,963 --> 00:17:19,880
Drink.

154
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,713
Wrong!

155
00:17:51,797 --> 00:17:53,880
Wrong, wrong, wrong! Drink!

156
00:17:56,004 --> 00:17:57,171
Mm!

157
00:17:57,254 --> 00:18:00,505
You were married. Before Sansa.

158
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,672
Drink.

159
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:09,922
You're drinking wine,
but you prefer ale!

160
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:10,922
No!

161
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:25,880
You're a virgin.

162
00:18:31,421 --> 00:18:33,129
That's a statement about the present.

163
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:36,129
At no point in the past,
up until this very moment,

164
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:38,213
have you slept with a man.

165
00:18:39,838 --> 00:18:40,880
Or a woman.

166
00:18:47,254 --> 00:18:49,046
I have to piss.

167
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:53,129
We did it!
We faced those icy fucks.

168
00:18:53,213 --> 00:18:55,797
Looked right into their blue eyes,

169
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,254
and here we are.

170
00:18:58,713 --> 00:19:02,171
Now, which one of you cowards
shit in my pants?

171
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:08,004
Please pardon me for a moment.

172
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,046
Drink it!

173
00:19:50,463 --> 00:19:52,630
And after all that,

174
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:56,254
this fucker comes north
and takes her from me.

175
00:19:56,338 --> 00:19:58,254
Just takes her, like that.

176
00:20:00,254 --> 00:20:01,880
I mean it, Clegane.

177
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:03,546
My heart is broken.

178
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,880
Don't touch me.

179
00:20:04,963 --> 00:20:06,296
You can touch me.

180
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:09,630
I'm not afraid of wildlings.

181
00:20:09,713 --> 00:20:11,463
Maybe you should be.

182
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,088
Well, Clegane...

183
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:20,713
it's time to drown our sorrows.

184
00:20:20,797 --> 00:20:22,463
I'm not done with my drink.

185
00:20:23,588 --> 00:20:25,463
You saved the day.

186
00:20:25,546 --> 00:20:26,922
You owe me one.

187
00:20:27,004 --> 00:20:30,505
- Don't forget that.
- For the rest of my days.

188
00:20:31,922 --> 00:20:33,088
Are you ready now?

189
00:20:33,171 --> 00:20:35,296
This is my drink.

190
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:42,546
All right!

191
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:53,338
She could have made you
happy, for a little while.

192
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,838
There's only one thing
that'll make me happy.

193
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:00,755
And what's that?

194
00:21:00,838 --> 00:21:03,213
That's my fucking business.

195
00:21:07,922 --> 00:21:10,755
Used to be you couldn't look at me.

196
00:21:10,838 --> 00:21:13,088
That was a long time ago.

197
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,880
I've seen much worse than you
since then.

198
00:21:15,963 --> 00:21:17,922
Yes, I've heard.

199
00:21:18,004 --> 00:21:19,755
Heard you were broken in.

200
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:22,380
Heard you were broken in rough.

201
00:21:23,505 --> 00:21:25,838
And he got what he deserved.

202
00:21:25,922 --> 00:21:27,254
I gave it to him.

203
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,672
How?

204
00:21:30,963 --> 00:21:32,088
Hounds.

205
00:21:35,922 --> 00:21:37,588
You've changed, Little Bird.

206
00:21:44,046 --> 00:21:45,421
None of it would have happened

207
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:47,338
if you'd left King's Landing with me.

208
00:21:47,421 --> 00:21:50,421
No Littlefinger, no Ramsay...

209
00:21:52,046 --> 00:21:53,296
none of it.

210
00:22:01,672 --> 00:22:04,213
Without Littlefinger,
and Ramsay and the rest,

211
00:22:04,296 --> 00:22:06,797
I would have stayed
a Little Bird all my life.

212
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:31,421
- Hey!
- Pour another one.

213
00:22:43,838 --> 00:22:45,004
Don't shoot.

214
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:50,922
It's nighttime, it's freezing,
and everyone's celebrating.

215
00:22:51,004 --> 00:22:53,505
You should be celebrating with them.

216
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:54,963
I am celebrating.

217
00:22:56,838 --> 00:22:58,797
Yeah, I am too.

218
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,963
I'm not Gendry Rivers anymore.

219
00:23:03,046 --> 00:23:06,421
I'm Gendry Baratheon,
Lord of Storm's End.

220
00:23:06,505 --> 00:23:08,838
By order of the queen.

221
00:23:10,546 --> 00:23:11,838
Congratulations.

222
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:17,088
I don't know how to be
lord of anything.

223
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:18,797
I hardly know how to use a fork.

224
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,797
All I know is that you're beautiful,

225
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,004
and I love you,

226
00:23:22,088 --> 00:23:23,922
and none of it will be worth anything

227
00:23:24,004 --> 00:23:25,171
if you're not with me.

228
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,505
So be with me.

229
00:23:32,004 --> 00:23:35,630
Be my wife.
Be the Lady of Storm's End.

230
00:23:57,713 --> 00:24:00,129
You'll be a wonderful lord,

231
00:24:00,213 --> 00:24:03,254
and any lady
would be lucky to have you.

232
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,088
But I'm not a lady.

233
00:24:07,505 --> 00:24:08,880
I never have been.

234
00:24:11,213 --> 00:24:12,213
That's not me.

235
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,755
You didn't drink.

236
00:24:42,588 --> 00:24:45,630
- I didn't drink?
- In the game.

237
00:24:45,713 --> 00:24:48,880
- I drank.
- In the game. This is Dornish.

238
00:24:51,755 --> 00:24:55,296
This is not the game.
This is only drinking.

239
00:24:56,338 --> 00:24:57,463
Suit yourself.

240
00:25:08,421 --> 00:25:10,797
You keep it warm enough in here.

241
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:17,171
It's the first thing I learnt
when I came to the North.

242
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:18,630
Keep your fire going.

243
00:25:18,713 --> 00:25:21,046
Every time you leave the room,
put more wood on.

244
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:23,755
That's very diligent.
Very responsible.

245
00:25:23,838 --> 00:25:25,713
- Piss off.
- You know the first thing

246
00:25:25,797 --> 00:25:27,588
I learned in the North?

247
00:25:27,672 --> 00:25:29,755
I hate the fucking North.

248
00:25:30,922 --> 00:25:32,129
It grows on you.

249
00:25:33,838 --> 00:25:36,463
I don't want things growing on me.

250
00:25:37,713 --> 00:25:41,046
How about Tormund Giantsbane?

251
00:25:41,129 --> 00:25:42,630
Has he grown on you?

252
00:25:44,296 --> 00:25:46,296
He was very sad when you left.

253
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:49,630
You sound quite jealous.

254
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:53,963
I do, don't I?

255
00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:00,838
It's bloody hot in here.

256
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,004
Oh, move aside.

257
00:26:17,672 --> 00:26:18,713
What are you doing?

258
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:21,171
I'm taking your shirt off.

259
00:27:08,046 --> 00:27:10,380
I've never slept with a knight before.

260
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,338
I've never slept with anyone before.

261
00:27:16,254 --> 00:27:18,963
Then you have to drink.
Those are the rules.

262
00:27:20,046 --> 00:27:21,421
I told you--

263
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:38,421
Are you drunk?

264
00:27:43,088 --> 00:27:44,046
No.

265
00:27:49,088 --> 00:27:50,380
Only a little.

266
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:02,254
I didn't know Ser Jorah well...

267
00:28:03,672 --> 00:28:04,922
but I know this.

268
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,546
If he could have chosen a way to die,

269
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,630
it would have been protecting you.

270
00:28:11,672 --> 00:28:12,672
He loved me.

271
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,755
And I couldn't love him back.

272
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:21,588
Not the way he wanted.

273
00:28:25,046 --> 00:28:26,672
Not the way I love you.

274
00:28:29,797 --> 00:28:31,254
Is that all right?

275
00:29:10,546 --> 00:29:12,630
I wish you'd never told me.

276
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,672
If I didn't know,
I'd be happy right now.

277
00:29:18,129 --> 00:29:19,338
I try to forget.

278
00:29:21,004 --> 00:29:22,380
Tonight I did for a while,

279
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:25,254
and then I saw them
gathered around you.

280
00:29:26,546 --> 00:29:29,088
I saw the way they looked at you.

281
00:29:30,171 --> 00:29:31,546
I know that look.

282
00:29:33,213 --> 00:29:36,713
So many people have looked at me
that way, but never here.

283
00:29:36,797 --> 00:29:38,380
Never on this side of the sea.

284
00:29:39,838 --> 00:29:41,129
I told you I don't want it.

285
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:43,755
It doesn't matter what you want.

286
00:29:43,838 --> 00:29:45,630
You didn't want to be
King in the North.

287
00:29:45,713 --> 00:29:48,296
What happens when they demand
you press your claim,

288
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,880
and take what is mine?

289
00:29:53,338 --> 00:29:55,171
I'll refuse.

290
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:57,797
You are my queen. I don't know
what else I can say.

291
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,088
You can say nothing.

292
00:30:00,171 --> 00:30:01,630
To anyone, ever.

293
00:30:01,713 --> 00:30:03,713
Never tell them who you really are.

294
00:30:03,797 --> 00:30:06,213
Swear your brother
and Samwell Tarly to secrecy,

295
00:30:06,296 --> 00:30:07,505
and tell no one else.

296
00:30:07,588 --> 00:30:09,213
Or it will take on a life of its own

297
00:30:09,296 --> 00:30:11,004
and you won't be able to control it

298
00:30:11,088 --> 00:30:12,296
or what it does to people.

299
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,880
No matter how many times
you bend the knee,

300
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:16,922
no matter what you swear.

301
00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:25,546
I want it to be the way it was
between us.

302
00:30:34,755 --> 00:30:36,546
I have to tell Sansa and Arya.

303
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:43,004
Sansa will want to see me gone
and you on the Iron Throne.

304
00:30:43,088 --> 00:30:44,755
She won't.

305
00:30:44,838 --> 00:30:47,880
She's not the girl you grew up with.

306
00:30:47,963 --> 00:30:50,254
Not after what she's seen,

307
00:30:50,338 --> 00:30:52,963
not after what they've done to her.

308
00:30:56,338 --> 00:30:58,213
I owe them the truth.

309
00:30:58,296 --> 00:31:01,171
Even if the truth destroys us?

310
00:31:01,254 --> 00:31:02,963
- It won't.
- It will.

311
00:31:05,505 --> 00:31:07,296
I've never begged for anything...

312
00:31:08,546 --> 00:31:10,713
but I'm begging you.

313
00:31:10,797 --> 00:31:13,797
Don't do this. Please.

314
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:21,797
You are my queen.

315
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,254
Nothing will change that.

316
00:31:28,171 --> 00:31:29,880
And they are my family.

317
00:31:31,838 --> 00:31:33,505
We can live together.

318
00:31:39,421 --> 00:31:40,380
We can.

319
00:31:42,588 --> 00:31:44,338
I've just told you how.

320
00:32:20,463 --> 00:32:22,338
Half are gone.

321
00:32:26,171 --> 00:32:27,672
The Northmen as well.

322
00:32:34,046 --> 00:32:37,213
And the Golden Company
has arrived in King's Landing,

323
00:32:37,296 --> 00:32:39,296
courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet.

324
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:43,088
The balance has grown
distressingly even.

325
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:45,963
When the people find out
what we have done for them,

326
00:32:46,046 --> 00:32:47,296
that we saved them--

327
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,713
Cersei will make sure
they don't believe it.

328
00:32:51,713 --> 00:32:53,338
We will hit her hard.

329
00:32:53,421 --> 00:32:55,630
We will rip her out root and stem.

330
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,713
The objective here is to remove Cersei

331
00:32:59,797 --> 00:33:02,463
without destroying King's Landing.

332
00:33:05,588 --> 00:33:09,421
Thankfully,
she's losing allies by the day.

333
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:12,338
Yara Greyjoy has retaken
the Iron Islands

334
00:33:12,421 --> 00:33:13,713
in her queen's name.

335
00:33:13,797 --> 00:33:16,463
The new Prince of Dorne
pledges his support.

336
00:33:16,546 --> 00:33:18,588
No matter how many lords
turn against her,

337
00:33:18,672 --> 00:33:20,463
as long as she sits on the Iron Throne,

338
00:33:20,546 --> 00:33:23,254
she can call herself
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

339
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:27,338
We need the capital.

340
00:33:27,421 --> 00:33:29,171
I watched the people of King's Landing

341
00:33:29,254 --> 00:33:31,546
rebel against their king
when they were hungry,

342
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,838
and that was before winter began.

343
00:33:33,922 --> 00:33:37,463
Give them the opportunity
and they will cast Cersei aside.

344
00:33:39,171 --> 00:33:41,546
We'll surround the city.

345
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,880
If the Iron Fleet
tries to ferry in more food,

346
00:33:43,963 --> 00:33:46,046
the dragons will destroy them.

347
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:48,546
If the Lannisters
and the Golden Company attack,

348
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,296
we'll defeat them in the field.

349
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,046
Once the people see
that Cersei is our only enemy,

350
00:33:54,129 --> 00:33:56,129
her reign is over.

351
00:34:01,296 --> 00:34:02,755
All right.

352
00:34:02,838 --> 00:34:05,963
The men we have left are exhausted.

353
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:07,254
Many of them are wounded.

354
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:09,213
They'll fight better if they have time

355
00:34:09,296 --> 00:34:10,672
to rest and recuperate.

356
00:34:11,963 --> 00:34:13,171
How long do you suggest?

357
00:34:14,338 --> 00:34:15,838
I can't say for certain,

358
00:34:15,922 --> 00:34:17,963
not without talking to the officers.

359
00:34:21,338 --> 00:34:24,213
I came north to fight alongside you

360
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:26,838
at great cost to my armies and myself.

361
00:34:28,088 --> 00:34:30,922
Now that the time has come
to reciprocate,

362
00:34:31,004 --> 00:34:32,797
you want to postpone.

363
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,755
It's not just our people.
It's yours.

364
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:37,463
You want to throw them into a war

365
00:34:37,546 --> 00:34:39,088
they're not ready to fight?

366
00:34:39,171 --> 00:34:40,880
The longer I leave my enemies alone,

367
00:34:40,963 --> 00:34:42,463
the stronger they become.

368
00:34:46,004 --> 00:34:49,546
The Northern forces
will honor their promises

369
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,922
and their allegiance

370
00:34:51,004 --> 00:34:53,505
to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

371
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,713
What you command, we will obey.

372
00:35:05,463 --> 00:35:07,046
So...

373
00:35:07,129 --> 00:35:10,046
if all are in agreement...

374
00:35:10,129 --> 00:35:12,963
Jon and Ser Davos
will ride down the Kingsroad

375
00:35:13,046 --> 00:35:14,421
with the Northern troops

376
00:35:14,505 --> 00:35:17,046
and the bulk of the remaining
Dothraki and Unsullied.

377
00:35:17,129 --> 00:35:19,463
A smaller group of us
will ride to White Harbor,

378
00:35:19,546 --> 00:35:21,463
and sail from there to Dragonstone

379
00:35:21,546 --> 00:35:25,254
with our queen and her dragons
accompanying us from above.

380
00:35:25,338 --> 00:35:28,004
Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here,

381
00:35:28,088 --> 00:35:30,380
as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell.

382
00:35:33,421 --> 00:35:35,338
We have won the Great War.

383
00:35:36,338 --> 00:35:38,088
Now we will win the Last War.

384
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,380
In all Seven Kingdoms,

385
00:35:41,463 --> 00:35:44,254
men will live without fear and cruelty

386
00:35:45,338 --> 00:35:46,755
under their rightful queen.

387
00:36:00,213 --> 00:36:01,380
We need a word.

388
00:36:05,505 --> 00:36:08,463
You understand we'd all be dead
if not for her.

389
00:36:08,546 --> 00:36:10,838
We'd be corpses
marching down to King's Landing.

390
00:36:10,922 --> 00:36:12,338
Arya's the one
that killed the Night King.

391
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:14,505
Her men gave their lives
defending Winterfell--

392
00:36:14,588 --> 00:36:16,171
And we will never forget them.

393
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:18,129
That doesn't mean that I want
to kneel to someone who--

394
00:36:18,213 --> 00:36:20,880
I swore myself and the North
to her cause.

395
00:36:20,963 --> 00:36:22,505
I respect that.

396
00:36:25,129 --> 00:36:26,797
You respect it?

397
00:36:27,505 --> 00:36:29,254
We needed her.

398
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,254
We needed her army, her dragons.

399
00:36:35,046 --> 00:36:36,838
You did the right thing.

400
00:36:36,922 --> 00:36:39,338
And we're doing the right thing
telling you

401
00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:40,963
we don't trust your queen.

402
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,171
- You don't know her yet.
- I'll never know her.

403
00:36:45,254 --> 00:36:46,546
She's not one of us.

404
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,546
If you only trust the people
you grew up with,

405
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,963
you won't make many allies.

406
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:51,588
That's all right.

407
00:36:51,672 --> 00:36:53,797
I don't need many allies.

408
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,129
- Arya...
- We're family.

409
00:36:57,463 --> 00:36:58,672
The four of us.

410
00:36:59,755 --> 00:37:01,463
The last of the Starks.

411
00:37:05,505 --> 00:37:06,963
I've never been a Stark.

412
00:37:08,129 --> 00:37:09,713
You are.

413
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:12,797
You're just as much
Ned Stark's child as any of us.

414
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,755
You're my brother.

415
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:17,338
Not my half-brother
or my bastard brother.

416
00:37:18,171 --> 00:37:19,713
My brother.

417
00:37:27,254 --> 00:37:29,004
It's your choice.

418
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,380
I need to tell you something.

419
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,380
But you have to swear
you'll never tell another soul.

420
00:37:46,672 --> 00:37:48,004
What is it?

421
00:37:49,296 --> 00:37:52,338
You have to swear it,
before I tell you.

422
00:37:52,421 --> 00:37:54,004
How can I promise to keep a secret

423
00:37:54,088 --> 00:37:55,630
if I don't even know what it is?

424
00:37:55,713 --> 00:37:57,380
Because we're family.

425
00:38:02,463 --> 00:38:03,421
Swear it.

426
00:38:04,755 --> 00:38:06,171
I swear it.

427
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:11,838
I swear it.

428
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,171
Tell them.

429
00:38:31,713 --> 00:38:34,254
So she's going to stay here with you?

430
00:38:36,713 --> 00:38:39,922
She's sworn to protect
the Stark girls, so...

431
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,713
Say something snide.

432
00:38:45,922 --> 00:38:46,922
I'm happy.

433
00:38:47,004 --> 00:38:48,755
I'm happy that you're happy.

434
00:38:51,672 --> 00:38:55,046
I'm happy that you'll finally
have to climb for it.

435
00:38:57,088 --> 00:39:00,380
Do you know how long I've waited
to tell tall-person jokes?

436
00:39:01,588 --> 00:39:03,880
To climbing mountains.

437
00:39:03,963 --> 00:39:05,421
To climbing mountains.

438
00:39:08,004 --> 00:39:11,004
- What's she like down there?
- What?

439
00:39:11,088 --> 00:39:13,046
That's not your concern.

440
00:39:13,129 --> 00:39:15,672
I haven't been with a woman for years.

441
00:39:15,755 --> 00:39:17,254
- Give me a morsel.
- You're a dog.

442
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:19,213
I am the Imp, and I demand to know.

443
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,088
I knew you were fucking her.

444
00:39:23,004 --> 00:39:24,922
A pair of tall, blond toffs.

445
00:39:25,004 --> 00:39:26,672
Must be like looking in the mirror.

446
00:39:26,755 --> 00:39:28,588
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

447
00:39:30,213 --> 00:39:31,963
Where's your drink?

448
00:39:32,046 --> 00:39:34,171
What are you--
What are you doing up North?

449
00:39:34,254 --> 00:39:35,713
What are you doing with that?

450
00:39:35,797 --> 00:39:37,338
Oh, this?

451
00:39:37,421 --> 00:39:38,463
This is for you.

452
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:41,046
For both of you.

453
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,213
You're supposed to be south.

454
00:39:43,296 --> 00:39:45,213
You boys are a pair
of gold-plated cunts.

455
00:39:45,296 --> 00:39:46,797
- Do you know that?
- That's a bit rude.

456
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,088
Year after year,
I've shoveled Lannister shit,

457
00:39:49,171 --> 00:39:52,088
- and what do I have to show?
- You're a knight, thanks to me.

458
00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:53,755
Thanks to me.
And that title's worth as much

459
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:56,046
as a blond hair
from your brother's ballsack.

460
00:39:56,129 --> 00:39:57,713
Power resides where men believe--

461
00:39:57,797 --> 00:39:59,755
Shut your mouth.

462
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:02,171
- I'm just trying--
- I've never hit a dwarf before,

463
00:40:02,254 --> 00:40:04,129
but say another word
and I will belt you.

464
00:40:04,213 --> 00:40:06,755
See, I don't believe
you'd do that, after all--

465
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:08,588
You couldn't do it on your best day,

466
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:09,755
you one-handed fuck.

467
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:11,421
And your best days are long gone.

468
00:40:11,505 --> 00:40:13,004
You broke my nose!

469
00:40:13,088 --> 00:40:14,797
- I did not break your nose.
- How do you know?

470
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,171
Because I've been breaking noses
since I was your size,

471
00:40:17,254 --> 00:40:20,171
and I know what it sounds like.
Now listen.

472
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:22,838
Your sister offered me Riverrun.

473
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:24,421
Nice big castle, good lands,

474
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,546
plenty of peasants
who do what they're told.

475
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,296
- And you trust Cersei--
- I knew your sister was dead

476
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,171
the second I saw those dragons.

477
00:40:31,254 --> 00:40:32,838
Now, your army may be torn to shit,

478
00:40:32,922 --> 00:40:35,129
but I'd still bet
on your Dragon Queen to win.

479
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:37,713
And it just so happens
I'm a betting man.

480
00:40:38,963 --> 00:40:41,880
If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.

481
00:40:44,213 --> 00:40:46,380
Mmm, that's good.
Of course, the odds change

482
00:40:46,463 --> 00:40:48,463
if the Dragon Queen's Hand
turns up dead.

483
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:51,421
Maybe a few of her top generals
get picked off one by one.

484
00:40:51,505 --> 00:40:53,421
- All of a sudden...
- May I speak?

485
00:40:53,505 --> 00:40:56,171
Why not?
Only death will shut you up.

486
00:40:59,546 --> 00:41:02,380
We made a deal long ago.
Do you remember?

487
00:41:02,463 --> 00:41:03,630
If anyone offered me money

488
00:41:03,713 --> 00:41:05,963
to kill you, you'd pay me double.

489
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,505
What's double Riverrun?

490
00:41:08,546 --> 00:41:09,546
Highgarden.

491
00:41:11,713 --> 00:41:13,213
You could be Lord of the Reach.

492
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:16,129
- Highgarden? Are you mad?
- It's better than being dead.

493
00:41:16,213 --> 00:41:17,421
He's not going to kill us.

494
00:41:17,505 --> 00:41:19,254
He wouldn't be talking to us if--

495
00:41:22,254 --> 00:41:23,505
The way I see it,

496
00:41:23,588 --> 00:41:26,254
I only need one
of the Lannister brothers alive.

497
00:41:26,338 --> 00:41:28,463
Highgarden will never belong
to a cutthroat.

498
00:41:28,546 --> 00:41:30,672
No? Who were your ancestors,

499
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,922
the ones who made your family rich?

500
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:34,588
Fancy lads in silk?

501
00:41:34,672 --> 00:41:36,338
They were fucking cutthroats.

502
00:41:36,421 --> 00:41:38,838
That's how all the great houses
started, isn't it?

503
00:41:38,922 --> 00:41:41,338
With a hard bastard
who was good at killing people.

504
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:43,755
Kill a few hundred people,
they make you a lord.

505
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:45,838
Kill a few thousand,
they make you king.

506
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:50,338
And then all your cocksucking
grandsons can ruin the family

507
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:51,963
with their cocksucking ways.

508
00:41:55,797 --> 00:41:56,797
Highgarden.

509
00:41:58,588 --> 00:42:00,129
Give me your word.

510
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,338
You have my word.

511
00:42:05,213 --> 00:42:08,588
None of this means a thing
until we take King's Landing.

512
00:42:09,713 --> 00:42:12,129
We ride south in the morning.

513
00:42:12,213 --> 00:42:13,380
We could use an officer

514
00:42:13,463 --> 00:42:15,713
with knowledge of the city's defenses.

515
00:42:15,797 --> 00:42:17,046
Oh, no.

516
00:42:17,129 --> 00:42:19,713
No, my fighting days are done.

517
00:42:19,797 --> 00:42:22,838
But I still got a few
killing days left, you hear me?

518
00:42:22,922 --> 00:42:25,546
I'll come find you
when the war is done.

519
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,922
Till then, don't die.

520
00:42:52,713 --> 00:42:54,838
For fuck's sake.

521
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,463
On your own?

522
00:42:58,672 --> 00:43:00,171
Not anymore.

523
00:43:01,672 --> 00:43:03,296
I don't like crowds.

524
00:43:04,963 --> 00:43:06,004
Me neither.

525
00:43:07,213 --> 00:43:09,380
Why not? They all love you now.

526
00:43:09,463 --> 00:43:11,046
You're the big hero.

527
00:43:12,213 --> 00:43:13,797
Don't like heroes.

528
00:43:15,755 --> 00:43:19,213
It must have felt good sticking
a knife in that horned fucker.

529
00:43:20,505 --> 00:43:22,213
Felt better than dying.

530
00:43:25,672 --> 00:43:27,380
You're heading to King's Landing?

531
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:31,088
I have some unfinished business.

532
00:43:32,421 --> 00:43:33,838
Me too.

533
00:43:39,922 --> 00:43:42,046
I don't plan on coming back.

534
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,046
Neither do I.

535
00:43:47,672 --> 00:43:50,046
Gonna leave me to die again
if I get hurt?

536
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,296
Probably.

537
00:44:37,588 --> 00:44:38,546
My lady.

538
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:45,588
"My lord" is the standard response.

539
00:44:48,004 --> 00:44:49,421
Why her?

540
00:44:53,463 --> 00:44:55,463
You know she loves your brother.

541
00:44:55,546 --> 00:44:57,672
That doesn't mean
she'll be a good queen.

542
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,588
You seem determined to dislike her.

543
00:45:03,046 --> 00:45:04,213
A good relationship

544
00:45:04,296 --> 00:45:05,630
between the Iron Throne and the North

545
00:45:05,713 --> 00:45:07,463
has been the core of every peaceful,

546
00:45:07,546 --> 00:45:09,129
prosperous reign we've ever known.

547
00:45:09,213 --> 00:45:10,713
Jon will be Warden of the North,

548
00:45:10,797 --> 00:45:12,797
so a good relationship seems likely.

549
00:45:14,505 --> 00:45:17,713
I don't expect him to spend
much time here going forward.

550
00:45:17,797 --> 00:45:19,797
Well, I suppose that's up to him.

551
00:45:24,129 --> 00:45:25,505
Sansa, look at me.

552
00:45:31,254 --> 00:45:33,421
With Jon in the capital,

553
00:45:33,505 --> 00:45:36,171
you'll be the true power in the North.

554
00:45:36,254 --> 00:45:38,046
I'd feel much better about the future

555
00:45:38,129 --> 00:45:39,463
if I left here today believing

556
00:45:39,546 --> 00:45:41,129
that you and Daenerys were allies.

557
00:45:41,213 --> 00:45:44,963
What are you worried about?
Jon's taking our army with him.

558
00:45:45,046 --> 00:45:46,713
Your queen still has her dragons--

559
00:45:46,797 --> 00:45:47,963
She's your queen too.

560
00:45:55,004 --> 00:45:57,254
You don't have to be her friend.

561
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:59,254
But why provoke her?

562
00:45:59,338 --> 00:46:01,588
How is that in the best interest
of your family,

563
00:46:01,672 --> 00:46:04,088
- or the North, or--?
- You're afraid of her.

564
00:46:06,546 --> 00:46:10,880
Every good ruler
needs to inspire a bit of fear.

565
00:46:13,463 --> 00:46:15,755
I don't want Jon to go down there.

566
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,505
The men in my family
don't do well in the capital.

567
00:46:19,588 --> 00:46:22,296
No, but as your brother once told me,

568
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,755
he's not a Stark.

569
00:46:29,338 --> 00:46:30,713
Are you all right?

570
00:46:37,213 --> 00:46:39,797
Her people love her, you've seen that.

571
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,213
You've seen how they fight for her.

572
00:46:42,296 --> 00:46:45,463
She wants to make the world
a better place.

573
00:46:47,797 --> 00:46:49,880
I believe in her.

574
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,088
Tyrion.

575
00:47:08,922 --> 00:47:11,505
What if there's someone else?

576
00:47:11,588 --> 00:47:13,213
Someone better?

577
00:47:21,546 --> 00:47:23,588
You're not gonna ride the dragon south?

578
00:47:27,296 --> 00:47:28,463
Just a horse.

579
00:47:29,797 --> 00:47:30,963
Rhaegal needs to heal.

580
00:47:31,046 --> 00:47:32,755
He doesn't need me weighing him down.

581
00:47:32,838 --> 00:47:36,171
You weigh as much as two fleas fucking.

582
00:47:37,463 --> 00:47:39,129
I'm taking the Free Folk home.

583
00:47:40,129 --> 00:47:42,880
We've had enough of the south.

584
00:47:42,963 --> 00:47:45,004
The women down here don't like me.

585
00:47:47,088 --> 00:47:49,254
This is the North, you know.

586
00:47:50,505 --> 00:47:52,922
And the Free Folk are welcome to stay.

587
00:47:54,463 --> 00:47:56,129
It isn't home.

588
00:47:56,213 --> 00:47:57,672
We need room to wander.

589
00:47:57,755 --> 00:47:59,838
I'll take them
back through Castle Black

590
00:47:59,922 --> 00:48:02,380
as soon as the winter storms pass.

591
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:04,129
Back where we belong.

592
00:48:08,088 --> 00:48:10,421
It's where he belongs too.

593
00:48:10,505 --> 00:48:13,213
A direwolf has no place in the south.

594
00:48:14,463 --> 00:48:16,838
Will you take him with you?

595
00:48:18,088 --> 00:48:20,046
He'll be happier up there.

596
00:48:21,088 --> 00:48:22,380
So would you.

597
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,797
I wish I was going with you.

598
00:48:31,171 --> 00:48:32,463
This is farewell, then.

599
00:48:34,046 --> 00:48:35,713
You never know.

600
00:48:41,922 --> 00:48:44,171
You've got the North in you.

601
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:47,129
The real North.

602
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:22,797
Yes, well, the nights
have been getting longer

603
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,463
and there wasn't that much
to do in Oldtown.

604
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:28,171
There's only so many books
a person can read, so we--

605
00:49:28,254 --> 00:49:30,963
I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam.

606
00:49:34,254 --> 00:49:36,922
If it's a boy, we want to name him Jon.

607
00:49:40,254 --> 00:49:41,755
I hope it's a girl.

608
00:50:00,588 --> 00:50:02,713
You're the best friend I ever had.

609
00:50:05,171 --> 00:50:07,213
You too, Sam.

610
00:51:07,755 --> 00:51:10,046
Think of the past 20 years.

611
00:51:11,046 --> 00:51:13,963
The war, the murder, the misery.

612
00:51:14,046 --> 00:51:16,463
All of it because
Robert Baratheon loved someone

613
00:51:16,546 --> 00:51:18,463
who didn't love him back.

614
00:51:20,546 --> 00:51:21,713
How many others know?

615
00:51:23,505 --> 00:51:26,129
Including us? Eight.

616
00:51:26,213 --> 00:51:28,296
Well, then it's not a secret anymore.

617
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,171
It's information.

618
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:33,588
If a handful of people know now,
hundreds will know soon.

619
00:51:33,672 --> 00:51:35,088
Then what happens?

620
00:51:35,171 --> 00:51:36,755
She loses the North.

621
00:51:36,838 --> 00:51:39,630
She loses the Vale,
Sansa will make sure of that.

622
00:51:39,713 --> 00:51:41,129
No, it's worse than that.

623
00:51:41,213 --> 00:51:43,963
He has the better claim to the throne.

624
00:51:44,046 --> 00:51:46,254
He doesn't want the throne.

625
00:51:46,338 --> 00:51:48,755
I'm not sure it matters what he wants.

626
00:51:49,963 --> 00:51:53,213
The fact is, people are drawn to him.

627
00:51:53,296 --> 00:51:55,004
Wildlings, Northmen.

628
00:51:57,004 --> 00:51:58,254
He's a war hero.

629
00:52:02,713 --> 00:52:04,880
He loves our queen.

630
00:52:06,421 --> 00:52:07,713
And she loves him.

631
00:52:09,922 --> 00:52:12,338
If we marry them,
they could rule together.

632
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,546
She's his aunt.

633
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:15,963
That never stopped a Targaryen before.

634
00:52:16,046 --> 00:52:17,755
No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell.

635
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:20,088
Is marrying your aunt
common in the North?

636
00:52:22,838 --> 00:52:24,505
You know our queen better than I do.

637
00:52:24,588 --> 00:52:27,296
Do you think
she wants to share the throne?

638
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,922
She does not like to have
her authority questioned.

639
00:52:30,004 --> 00:52:31,254
Something she has in common

640
00:52:31,338 --> 00:52:33,922
with every monarch who ever lived.

641
00:52:34,004 --> 00:52:35,797
I worry about her state of mind.

642
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,004
We are advisors to the queen.

643
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:41,421
Worrying about her state of mind
is our job.

644
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,421
We still have to take King's Landing.

645
00:52:52,588 --> 00:52:55,171
Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all.

646
00:52:55,254 --> 00:52:57,546
That would solve our problems.

647
00:55:01,088 --> 00:55:03,546
Get to the skiff. Now!

648
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:07,088
Spears!

649
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:09,129
They're coming round again!

650
00:55:17,755 --> 00:55:19,213
Go!

651
00:55:19,296 --> 00:55:20,505
Clear!

652
00:55:20,588 --> 00:55:22,463
Man your stations!

653
00:55:22,546 --> 00:55:24,213
No!

654
00:55:42,129 --> 00:55:44,713
- Go! Go!
- Clear!

655
00:56:20,421 --> 00:56:21,505
Missandei?

656
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,338
Missandei!

657
00:56:30,421 --> 00:56:31,838
Missandei!

658
00:56:36,755 --> 00:56:38,755
Our message was well-received, then?

659
00:56:38,838 --> 00:56:42,129
Your people have
heard the Usurper is coming.

660
00:56:42,213 --> 00:56:44,713
They are grateful for your protection

661
00:56:44,797 --> 00:56:47,171
within the walls of the Red Keep.

662
00:56:49,421 --> 00:56:51,380
You're certain about the dragon?

663
00:56:51,463 --> 00:56:53,713
I saw it sink beneath the waves.

664
00:56:53,797 --> 00:56:56,046
That must have been glorious.

665
00:56:58,254 --> 00:57:00,380
The glory is yours, my queen.

666
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,380
When the war is won,
the Lion shall rule the land,

667
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:06,129
the Kraken shall rule the sea...

668
00:57:07,505 --> 00:57:10,713
and our child
shall one day rule them all.

669
00:57:27,546 --> 00:57:29,254
She's coming for you.

670
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,588
Of course she is.

671
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,088
Keep the gates open.

672
00:57:36,171 --> 00:57:38,797
If she wants to take the castle,
she'll have to murder

673
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,380
thousands of innocent people first.

674
00:57:47,463 --> 00:57:49,963
So much for
"the Breaker of Chains."

675
00:58:03,505 --> 00:58:05,963
We will storm the city, my queen.

676
00:58:06,046 --> 00:58:09,254
We will kill your enemies.
All of them.

677
00:58:09,338 --> 00:58:10,421
Your Grace.

678
00:58:12,004 --> 00:58:15,672
I promised you I would look you
in the eye and speak directly

679
00:58:15,755 --> 00:58:18,088
if I ever thought
you were making a mistake.

680
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:24,380
This is a mistake.

681
00:58:26,922 --> 00:58:29,463
You saw my child fall from the sky.

682
00:58:31,088 --> 00:58:33,088
They took Missandei.

683
00:58:33,171 --> 00:58:35,171
Cersei needs to be destroyed,

684
00:58:35,254 --> 00:58:39,463
but if we attack King's Landing
with Drogon and the Unsullied

685
00:58:39,546 --> 00:58:40,755
and the Dothraki,

686
00:58:40,838 --> 00:58:43,004
tens of thousands
of innocents will die.

687
00:58:43,088 --> 00:58:47,797
That is why Cersei is bringing
them into the Red Keep.

688
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,546
These are the people
you came here to protect.

689
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:53,254
I beg you, Your Grace.

690
00:58:53,338 --> 00:58:57,046
Do not destroy the city
you came to save.

691
00:58:57,129 --> 00:59:00,963
Do not become what you
have always struggled to defeat.

692
00:59:05,797 --> 00:59:08,838
Do you believe we're here
for a reason, Lord Varys?

693
00:59:12,296 --> 00:59:15,380
I'm here to free the world
from tyrants.

694
00:59:16,546 --> 00:59:18,004
That is my destiny...

695
00:59:19,338 --> 00:59:22,296
and I will serve it,
no matter the cost.

696
00:59:29,254 --> 00:59:32,088
It could be a fortnight before
Jon and the allied armies

697
00:59:32,171 --> 00:59:34,171
make it to King's Landing.

698
00:59:34,254 --> 00:59:37,088
In the meantime,
demand Cersei surrender.

699
00:59:37,171 --> 00:59:40,505
Offer her her life
in exchange for the throne.

700
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:44,546
If there's a chance
to avoid the coming slaughter,

701
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:47,046
we should make the effort.

702
00:59:47,129 --> 00:59:50,004
Speaking to Cersei
will not prevent a slaughter.

703
00:59:52,254 --> 00:59:53,838
But perhaps it's good the people see

704
00:59:53,922 --> 00:59:57,922
that Daenerys Stormborn made
every effort to avoid bloodshed,

705
00:59:58,004 --> 01:00:00,338
and Cersei Lannister refused.

706
01:00:02,046 --> 01:00:03,463
They should know whom to blame

707
01:00:03,546 --> 01:00:05,672
when the sky falls down upon them.

708
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:22,421
I've served tyrants most of my life.

709
01:00:23,421 --> 01:00:26,630
They all talk about destiny.

710
01:00:26,713 --> 01:00:29,963
She's a girl who walked
into a fire with three stones

711
01:00:30,046 --> 01:00:32,713
and walked out with three dragons.

712
01:00:32,797 --> 01:00:35,546
How could she not believe in destiny?

713
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:37,505
Perhaps that's the problem.

714
01:00:37,588 --> 01:00:38,797
Her life has convinced her

715
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,755
that she was sent here to save us all.

716
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:42,755
And how do you know she wasn't?

717
01:00:45,004 --> 01:00:46,922
Then there's the problem of Jon Snow.

718
01:00:53,421 --> 01:00:56,213
Perhaps it's actually a solution.

719
01:00:57,755 --> 01:00:59,171
You know them both.

720
01:00:59,254 --> 01:01:02,380
Tell me, who do you think
would make a better ruler?

721
01:01:07,672 --> 01:01:09,421
He doesn't want the throne.

722
01:01:09,505 --> 01:01:11,963
That's why he bent the knee.

723
01:01:12,046 --> 01:01:14,129
Have you considered the best ruler

724
01:01:14,213 --> 01:01:16,630
might be someone
who doesn't want to rule?

725
01:01:16,713 --> 01:01:19,004
We're discussing treason.

726
01:01:19,088 --> 01:01:21,755
Don't pretend
you haven't thought about it.

727
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:25,171
Of course I've thought about it.
Thoughts aren't treason.

728
01:01:27,254 --> 01:01:31,296
He's temperate and measured.
He's a man,

729
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:34,129
which makes him more appealing
to the lords of Westeros,

730
01:01:34,213 --> 01:01:36,463
whose support we are going to need.

731
01:01:36,546 --> 01:01:37,963
Joffrey was a man.

732
01:01:38,046 --> 01:01:40,296
I don't think a cock
is a true qualification,

733
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:41,505
as I'm sure you'd agree.

734
01:01:41,588 --> 01:01:43,546
And he's the heir to the throne.

735
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:47,630
Yes, because he's a man.
Cocks are important, I'm afraid.

736
01:01:50,505 --> 01:01:53,546
What about my earlier proposal?

737
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:55,838
They could rule together
as king and queen.

738
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,797
She's too strong for him.

739
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:03,421
She'd bend him to her will,
as she already has.

740
01:02:03,505 --> 01:02:06,588
He could temper her worst impulses.

741
01:02:06,672 --> 01:02:08,630
As you have?

742
01:02:11,713 --> 01:02:13,880
You're drinking quite a lot.

743
01:02:16,296 --> 01:02:19,922
A Targaryen father and a Stark mother.

744
01:02:20,004 --> 01:02:22,922
Jon's the one man alive
who might actually be able

745
01:02:23,004 --> 01:02:24,880
to keep the North
in the Seven Kingdoms.

746
01:02:24,963 --> 01:02:26,546
How many kings and queens
have you served?

747
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:28,004
Five? Six? I've lost count.

748
01:02:28,088 --> 01:02:29,880
- You've always known my reasons.
- At a certain point,

749
01:02:29,963 --> 01:02:31,588
you choose a person you believe in,

750
01:02:31,672 --> 01:02:33,171
and you fight for that person.

751
01:02:33,254 --> 01:02:35,338
Even if you know it's a mistake?

752
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:38,880
I believe in our queen.

753
01:02:41,421 --> 01:02:43,630
She'll make the right choice.

754
01:02:45,213 --> 01:02:48,088
With the help of her loyal advisors.

755
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:54,213
You know where my loyalty stands.

756
01:02:54,296 --> 01:02:56,588
You know I will never betray the realm.

757
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:57,963
What is the realm?

758
01:02:58,046 --> 01:03:00,171
A vast continent,
home to millions of people,

759
01:03:00,254 --> 01:03:02,213
most of whom don't care
who sits on the Iron Throne.

760
01:03:02,296 --> 01:03:04,254
Millions of people,
many of whom will die

761
01:03:04,338 --> 01:03:07,004
if the wrong person
sits on that throne.

762
01:03:07,088 --> 01:03:08,296
We don't know their names,

763
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:10,254
but they're just as real as you and I.

764
01:03:10,338 --> 01:03:11,546
They deserve to live.

765
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:13,546
They deserve food for their children.

766
01:03:17,296 --> 01:03:21,588
I will act in their interest,
no matter the personal cost.

767
01:03:23,713 --> 01:03:26,380
So, what happens to her?

768
01:03:34,338 --> 01:03:35,546
Please.

769
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:38,922
Don't.

770
01:03:43,588 --> 01:03:46,088
I've spoken as honestly as I can.

771
01:03:47,588 --> 01:03:50,296
Each of us has a choice to make.

772
01:03:51,338 --> 01:03:54,296
I pray we choose wisely.

773
01:04:05,213 --> 01:04:07,046
I'm just about to start it.

774
01:04:07,129 --> 01:04:08,546
Good luck.

775
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:10,546
Protect shell right up to the wall.

776
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:12,213
All right, I'll put another one on it.

777
01:04:12,296 --> 01:04:14,129
He's headed down to the cellar.

778
01:04:14,213 --> 01:04:16,254
I'll need a cart over here.

779
01:04:16,338 --> 01:04:17,546
That's it, thanks.

780
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:19,213
Thank you.

781
01:04:19,296 --> 01:04:20,630
It's really heavy, mind you.

782
01:04:20,713 --> 01:04:21,963
We need some more water.

783
01:04:22,046 --> 01:04:23,630
Take it down there!

784
01:04:28,546 --> 01:04:30,963
...as are the rest
of her advisors.

785
01:04:33,296 --> 01:04:34,338
What happened?

786
01:04:39,963 --> 01:04:44,338
Euron Greyjoy ambushed
Queen Daenerys and her fleet.

787
01:04:44,421 --> 01:04:47,380
One of the dragons was killed,
several ships destroyed,

788
01:04:47,463 --> 01:04:49,630
Missandei captured.

789
01:04:51,505 --> 01:04:55,672
I always wanted to be there
when they execute your sister.

790
01:04:55,755 --> 01:04:58,463
Seems like I won't get the chance.

791
01:06:05,213 --> 01:06:07,838
They're going to destroy that city.

792
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,380
You know they will.

793
01:06:10,463 --> 01:06:12,755
Have you ever run away from a fight?

794
01:06:14,713 --> 01:06:17,129
You're not like your sister.
You're not.

795
01:06:17,213 --> 01:06:19,338
You're better than she is.

796
01:06:19,421 --> 01:06:21,963
You're a good man
and you can't save her.

797
01:06:22,046 --> 01:06:23,963
You don't need to die with her.

798
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:25,588
Stay here.

799
01:06:27,463 --> 01:06:28,797
Stay with me.

800
01:06:30,505 --> 01:06:32,463
Please.

801
01:06:33,546 --> 01:06:34,546
Stay.

802
01:06:41,213 --> 01:06:43,046
You think I'm a good man?

803
01:06:47,797 --> 01:06:50,505
I pushed a boy out a tower window,

804
01:06:50,588 --> 01:06:52,672
crippled him for life

805
01:06:52,755 --> 01:06:53,755
for Cersei.

806
01:06:56,838 --> 01:06:59,797
I strangled my cousin with my own hands

807
01:07:00,797 --> 01:07:02,922
just to get back to Cersei.

808
01:07:05,922 --> 01:07:07,254
I would have murdered

809
01:07:07,338 --> 01:07:11,546
every man, woman and child in Riverrun

810
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:12,755
for Cersei.

811
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:23,463
She's hateful.

812
01:07:25,338 --> 01:07:26,588
And so am I.

813
01:10:01,672 --> 01:10:02,630
My lord.

814
01:10:05,963 --> 01:10:09,004
Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's
unconditional surrender

815
01:10:09,088 --> 01:10:11,797
and the immediate release
of Missandei of Naath.

816
01:10:13,463 --> 01:10:17,880
Queen Cersei demands Daenerys's
unconditional surrender.

817
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:22,004
If she refuses, Missandei
of Naath will die here and now.

818
01:10:23,672 --> 01:10:24,672
Qyburn...

819
01:10:26,129 --> 01:10:27,922
you're a rational man.

820
01:10:28,004 --> 01:10:30,963
Or so I flatter myself, my lord.

821
01:10:31,046 --> 01:10:32,505
We have a chance here,

822
01:10:33,755 --> 01:10:37,254
perhaps our last chance,
to avoid carnage.

823
01:10:37,338 --> 01:10:38,338
Yes.

824
01:10:40,088 --> 01:10:41,046
Help me.

825
01:10:42,254 --> 01:10:45,129
I don't want to see this city burn.

826
01:10:45,213 --> 01:10:48,505
I don't want to hear the screams
of children burning alive.

827
01:10:50,505 --> 01:10:53,463
No, it is not a pleasant sound.

828
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:57,838
I-- I don't want to hear it.

829
01:10:58,838 --> 01:11:00,338
Help me save this city.

830
01:11:02,296 --> 01:11:04,963
My lord, I am only a mouthpiece
for our queen.

831
01:11:05,046 --> 01:11:06,755
Your queen.

832
01:11:06,838 --> 01:11:08,963
Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

833
01:11:09,046 --> 01:11:10,171
You are her subject.

834
01:11:10,254 --> 01:11:12,296
Her reign is over.

835
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:14,922
You understand this.
Help her understand it.

836
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:17,546
We understand nothing of the sort.

837
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,421
Your queen's last dragon is vulnerable.

838
01:11:21,505 --> 01:11:24,421
Your armies
are battle-weary and depleted,

839
01:11:24,505 --> 01:11:27,797
while ours have been reinforced
with the Golden Compan--

840
01:11:45,672 --> 01:11:47,838
Ready!

841
01:11:47,922 --> 01:11:48,963
Nock!

842
01:11:51,838 --> 01:11:53,046
Draw!

843
01:12:59,338 --> 01:13:02,171
I know you don't care
about your people.

844
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:05,922
Why should you?

845
01:13:07,421 --> 01:13:11,004
They hate you and you hate them.

846
01:13:16,505 --> 01:13:18,963
But you're not a monster.

847
01:13:21,004 --> 01:13:22,213
I know this.

848
01:13:24,338 --> 01:13:27,171
I know this because I've seen it.

849
01:13:31,046 --> 01:13:33,505
You've always loved your children.

850
01:13:35,505 --> 01:13:37,004
More than yourself,

851
01:13:38,004 --> 01:13:39,463
more than Jaime...

852
01:13:42,254 --> 01:13:43,713
more than anything.

853
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,338
I beg you.

854
01:13:50,546 --> 01:13:54,004
If not for yourself,
then for your child.

855
01:13:57,546 --> 01:14:00,088
Your reign is over,

856
01:14:00,171 --> 01:14:03,171
but that doesn't mean
your life has to end.

857
01:14:06,046 --> 01:14:08,922
It doesn't mean your baby has to die.

858
01:14:56,755 --> 01:15:00,421
If you have any last words,
now is the time.

859
01:15:25,171 --> 01:15:26,463
Dracarys.

860
01:15:35,672 --> 01:15:37,296
No.
