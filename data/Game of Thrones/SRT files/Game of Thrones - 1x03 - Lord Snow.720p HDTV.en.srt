2
00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:14,853
Welcome, Lord Stark.

3
00:02:14,973 --> 00:02:18,273
Grand Maester Pycelle has called
a meeting of the small council.

4
00:02:18,308 --> 00:02:20,408
The honor of your
presence is requested.

5
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,013
Get the girls settled in.
I'll be back in time for supper.

6
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:27,682
- And, Jory, you go with them.
- Yes, My Lord.

7
00:02:27,717 --> 00:02:31,453
If you'd like to change into
something more appropriate...

9
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:09,959
Thank the gods
you're here, Stark.

10
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:14,452
About time we had some stern
northern leadership.

11
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:17,066
About glad to see you're
protecting the throne.

12
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,134
Sturdy old thing.

13
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:21,637
How many kings' asses
have polished it, I wonder?

14
00:03:21,672 --> 00:03:23,672
Um, what's the line?

15
00:03:23,707 --> 00:03:26,810
The King shits
and the Hand wipes.

16
00:03:26,844 --> 00:03:30,314
Very handsome armor.

17
00:03:30,348 --> 00:03:32,750
- Not a scratch on it.
- I know.

18
00:03:32,784 --> 00:03:36,321
People have been swinging at me for
years, but they always seem to miss.

19
00:03:36,355 --> 00:03:39,224
You've chosen your
opponents wisely then.

20
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,495
I have a knack for it.

21
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:48,767
It must be strange for you
coming into this room.

22
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:54,006
I was standing right here
when it happened.

23
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,075
He was very brave,
your brother.

24
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,911
Your father too.

25
00:03:58,945 --> 00:04:01,079
They didn't deserve
to die like that.

26
00:04:01,114 --> 00:04:03,982
Nobody deserves
to die like that.

27
00:04:04,017 --> 00:04:05,884
But you just stood there
and watched.

28
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,888
500 men just stood there
and watched.

29
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:11,691
All the great knights
of the Seven Kingdoms--

30
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:14,126
You think anyone said a
word, lifted a finger?

31
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:16,762
No, Lord Stark.

32
00:04:16,797 --> 00:04:21,400
500 men and this room
was silent as a crypt.

33
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:25,538
Except for the screams,
of course,

34
00:04:25,572 --> 00:04:28,407
and the Mad King laughing.

35
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:31,177
And later...

36
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:33,845
When I watched
the Mad King die,

37
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:37,248
I remembered him laughing
as your father burned...

38
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:40,218
It felt like justice.

39
00:04:43,222 --> 00:04:45,890
Is that what you
tell yourself at night?

40
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,695
You're a servant of justice?

41
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:51,797
That you were avenging
my father when you

42
00:04:51,832 --> 00:04:54,401
shoved your sword in
Aerys Targaryen's back?

43
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:56,203
Tell me--

44
00:04:56,238 --> 00:04:59,273
If I'd stabbed the Mad King in
the belly instead of the back,

45
00:04:59,308 --> 00:05:01,877
would you admire me more?

46
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:04,446
You served him well

47
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,416
when serving was safe.

48
00:05:19,263 --> 00:05:21,498
Lord Stark.

49
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:25,735
Lord Varys.

50
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,138
I was grievously sorry to hear of
your troubles on the Kingsroad.

51
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:32,808
We are all praying for prince
Joffrey's full recovery.

52
00:05:32,843 --> 00:05:36,278
A shame you didn't say a
prayer for the butcher's son.

53
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:40,715
Renly!
You're looking well.

54
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:42,517
And you look
tired from the road.

55
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,719
I told them this meeting
could wait another day, but--

56
00:05:44,753 --> 00:05:47,522
<i>But we have a kingdom</i>
<i>to look after.</i>

57
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,825
I've hoped to meet you
for some time, Lord Stark.

58
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:54,462
- No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
- She has, Lord Baelish.

59
00:05:54,496 --> 00:05:57,565
I understand you knew
my brother Brandon as well.

60
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:00,835
All too well.
I still carry a token of his esteem

61
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:02,838
from navel to collarbone.

62
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:04,940
Perhaps you chose
the wrong man to duel with.

63
00:06:04,974 --> 00:06:06,942
It wasn't the <i>man</i>
that I chose, My Lord.

64
00:06:06,976 --> 00:06:09,345
It was Catelyn Tully.

65
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,716
A woman worth fighting for,
I'm sure you'll agree.

66
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,419
I humbly beg your pardon,
my Lord Stark.

67
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:18,089
Grand Maester.

68
00:06:18,123 --> 00:06:20,325
How many years has it been?

69
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,029
- <i>You were a young man.</i>
- And you served another King.

70
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:28,600
Oh, how forgetful of me.

71
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,470
This belongs to you, now.

72
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:36,842
<i>Should we begin?</i>

73
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:39,912
- Without the King?
- Winter may be coming,

74
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:43,249
but I'm afraid the same cannot
be said for my brother.

75
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:45,350
His Grace has many cares.

76
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:48,386
He entrusts some
small matters to us

77
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,221
that we might lighten the load.

78
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:53,157
We are the lords
of small matters here.

79
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:00,597
<i>My brother instructs us</i>
<i>to stage a tournament</i>

80
00:07:00,632 --> 00:07:03,467
in honor of Lord Stark's
appointment as Hand of the King.

81
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:07,171
- Mmm, how much?
- 40,000 gold dragons to the champion,

82
00:07:07,205 --> 00:07:08,906
<i>20,000 to the runner-up,</i>

83
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:12,076
20,000 to the winning archer.

84
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:14,413
Can the treasury bear
such expense?

85
00:07:14,448 --> 00:07:17,383
I'll have to borrow it.
The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect.

86
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:20,353
We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold.
What's another 80,000?

87
00:07:20,387 --> 00:07:22,521
Are you telling me the Crown
is three million in debt?

88
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:24,623
I'm telling you the Crown
is <i>six</i> million in debt.

89
00:07:24,657 --> 00:07:26,558
How could you let this happen?

90
00:07:26,592 --> 00:07:28,359
The Master of Coin
finds the money.

91
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:30,828
The King and the Hand spend it.

92
00:07:30,863 --> 00:07:32,597
I will not believe Jon Arryn

93
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:34,432
allowed Robert
to bankrupt the realm.

94
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:37,435
Lord Arryn gave wise
and prudent advice,

95
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:39,737
but I fear His Grace

96
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:43,674
- doesn't always listen.
- "Counting coppers," he calls it.

97
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,076
I'll speak to him tomorrow.

98
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:48,979
This tournament is an
extravagance we cannot afford.

99
00:07:49,013 --> 00:07:51,381
As you will.
But still, we'd best make our plans.

100
00:07:51,415 --> 00:07:53,549
There will be no plans

101
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,918
until I speak to Robert.

102
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:01,456
Forgive me, my Lords.
I'm--

103
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,160
- <i>I had a long ride.</i>
- You are the King's Hand,

104
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:08,764
Lord Stark, we serve
at your pleasure.

105
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:17,875
- Ow!
- Please, it's nearly healed.

106
00:08:20,312 --> 00:08:23,715
- It's ugly.
- A King should have scars

107
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:27,552
you fought off a direwolf.
You're a warrior like your father.

108
00:08:27,586 --> 00:08:29,888
I'm not like him.
I didn't fight off anything.

109
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:31,924
It bit me and all
I did was scream.

110
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,226
And the two Stark girls
saw it, both of them.

111
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,330
That's not true.
You killed the beast.

112
00:08:37,364 --> 00:08:40,566
You only spared the girl because of the
love your father bears her father.

113
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,427
I didn't, I--

114
00:08:41,547 --> 00:08:43,617
When Aerys Targaryen
sat on the Iron Throne,

115
00:08:43,737 --> 00:08:46,205
your father was a rebel
and a traitor.

116
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:50,609
Someday you'll sit on the throne and
the truth will be what you make it.

117
00:08:54,212 --> 00:08:56,079
Do I have to marry her?

118
00:08:56,114 --> 00:08:57,914
Yes.

119
00:08:59,216 --> 00:09:01,317
She's very beautiful and young.

120
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:04,587
If you don't like her, you only
need to see her on formal occasions

121
00:09:04,622 --> 00:09:08,524
and when the time comes, to make
little princes and princesses.

122
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:13,697
And if you'd rather fuck painted
whores, you'll fuck painted whores.

123
00:09:13,731 --> 00:09:16,833
And if you'd rather lie with
noble virgins, so be it.

124
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:18,901
You are my darling boy
and the world will be

125
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:21,170
exactly as you want it to be.

126
00:09:24,342 --> 00:09:26,643
Do something nice
for the Stark girl.

127
00:09:26,677 --> 00:09:28,946
- I don't want to.
- No, but you will.

128
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,050
The occasional kindness will spare you
all sorts of trouble down the road.

129
00:09:34,186 --> 00:09:36,120
We allow the northerners
too much power.

130
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:38,523
They consider themselves
our equals.

131
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:40,692
How would you handle them?

132
00:09:40,726 --> 00:09:42,894
I'd double their taxes

133
00:09:42,928 --> 00:09:46,430
and command them to supply
10,000 men to the royal army.

134
00:09:46,464 --> 00:09:49,733
- A royal army?
- Why should every lord command his own men?

135
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:52,101
It's primitive, no better
than the hill tribes.

136
00:09:52,136 --> 00:09:55,071
We should have a standing army
of men loyal to the Crown,

137
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:56,939
trained by
experienced soldiers--

138
00:09:56,974 --> 00:10:00,576
Instead of a mob of peasants who've
never held pikes in their lives.

139
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,178
And if the northerners rebel?

140
00:10:03,212 --> 00:10:04,847
I'd crush them.

141
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:07,583
Seize Winterfell and install
someone loyal to the realm

142
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:10,552
as Warden of the North.
Uncle Kevan, maybe.

143
00:10:10,587 --> 00:10:14,256
And these 10,000 northern troops, would
they fight for you or their lord?

144
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,725
- For me. I'm their King.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

145
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:18,860
But you've just
invaded their homeland,

146
00:10:18,894 --> 00:10:21,662
- asked them to kill their brothers.
- I'm not asking.

147
00:10:21,697 --> 00:10:24,699
The North cannot be held--
not by an outsider.

148
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:27,368
It's too big and too wild.
And when the winter comes,

149
00:10:27,402 --> 00:10:30,738
the seven gods together couldn't
save you and your royal army.

150
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:33,740
A good King knows
when to save his strength...

151
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:37,577
And when to destroy
his enemies.

152
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:40,346
So you agree...

153
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,782
The Starks are enemies?

154
00:10:44,785 --> 00:10:47,520
Everyone who isn't us

155
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:49,556
is an enemy.

156
00:10:51,826 --> 00:10:54,428
Enough of that, young lady.
Eat your food.

157
00:10:54,463 --> 00:10:56,364
- I'm practicing.
- Practicing for what?

158
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,466
- The prince.
- <i>Arya, stop!</i>

159
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:01,670
He's a liar and a coward
and he killed my friend.

160
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:03,497
The Hound killed your friend.

161
00:11:03,617 --> 00:11:05,555
The Hound does whatever
the prince tells him to do.

162
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:08,277
- You're an idiot.
- You're a liar, and if you told the truth

163
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:11,013
- Mycah would be alive.
- Enough!

164
00:11:12,615 --> 00:11:14,316
What's happening here?

165
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,652
Arya would rather act
like a beast than a lady.

166
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:21,656
Go to your room.
We'll speak later.

167
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,468
That's for you, love.

168
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:43,714
<i>The same dollmaker makes all</i>
<i>of Princess Myrcella's toys.</i>

169
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:48,553
Don't you like it?

170
00:11:48,587 --> 00:11:51,490
I haven't played with dolls
since I was eight.

171
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:55,661
- May I be excused?
- You've barely eaten a thing.

172
00:11:56,864 --> 00:11:59,366
It's all right.
Go on.

173
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,009
War was easier than daughters.

174
00:12:15,113 --> 00:12:17,714
- Go away!

175
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:20,316
Ned:
<i>Arya, open the door.</i>

176
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,561
May I come in?

177
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:41,703
- Whose sword is that?
- Mine.

178
00:12:41,738 --> 00:12:43,572
Give it to me.

179
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:53,183
I know this maker's mark.
This is Mikken's work.

180
00:12:55,287 --> 00:12:57,121
Where did you get this?

181
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:03,261
This is no toy.

182
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,065
- Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
- I wasn't playing.

183
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:10,033
And I don't want to be a lady.

184
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:12,468
Come here.

185
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,042
Now what do you want with this?

186
00:13:20,076 --> 00:13:21,977
It's called Needle.

187
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:24,647
Oh, a blade with a name.

188
00:13:25,882 --> 00:13:28,584
And who were you hoping
to skewer with Needle?

189
00:13:28,618 --> 00:13:30,353
Your sister?

190
00:13:30,387 --> 00:13:32,755
Do you know the first thing
about sword fighting?

191
00:13:32,789 --> 00:13:34,557
Stick 'em with the pointy end.

192
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,593
That's the essence of it.

193
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,465
I was trying to learn.

194
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:47,070
I asked Mycah
to practice with me.

195
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,542
I asked him.

196
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:54,446
- It was my fault.
- No, sweet girl.

197
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,983
No no, you didn't kill
the butcher's boy.

198
00:13:59,185 --> 00:14:02,421
I hate them!
I hate all of them.

199
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:05,057
The Hound, the Queen
and the King

200
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:06,598
and Joffrey and Sansa.

201
00:14:06,718 --> 00:14:10,244
Sansa was dragged before
the King and Queen...

202
00:14:10,364 --> 00:14:12,998
And asked to call
the prince a liar.

203
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:15,534
So was I!
He <i>is</i> a liar.

204
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:17,670
Shh, darling, listen to me.

205
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,175
Sansa will be married
to Joffrey's someday.

206
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:24,511
She cannot betray him.

207
00:14:24,545 --> 00:14:27,381
She must take his side
even when he's wrong.

208
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,319
But how you can let her
marry someone like that?

209
00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:35,123
Well.

210
00:14:36,726 --> 00:14:39,228
Look at me.

211
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:42,531
You're a Stark of Winterfell.
You know our words.

212
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,101
Winter is coming.

213
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:49,804
You were born
in the long summer.

214
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:51,939
You've never known
anything else.

215
00:14:51,973 --> 00:14:54,007
But now winter is truly coming.

216
00:14:54,042 --> 00:14:56,943
And in the winter,
we must protect ourselves,

217
00:14:56,977 --> 00:15:01,414
look after one another.
Sansa is your sister.

218
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:05,018
I don't hate her.

219
00:15:05,052 --> 00:15:07,220
Not really.

220
00:15:08,488 --> 00:15:10,456
I don't want to frighten you,

221
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:12,325
but I won't lie to you either.

222
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:14,761
We've come
to a dangerous place.

223
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:18,432
We cannot fight a war
amongst ourselves.

224
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:21,335
All right?

225
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:25,305
Go on.
It's yours.

226
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:29,709
I can keep it?

227
00:15:29,743 --> 00:15:32,912
Try not to stab
your sister with it.

229
00:15:41,486 --> 00:15:43,854
If you're going to own a sword,

230
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:45,756
you'd better
know how to use it.

233
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:57,198
Don't listen to it.
Crows are all liars.

234
00:15:59,435 --> 00:16:03,037
- I know a story about a crow.
- I hate your stories.

235
00:16:03,072 --> 00:16:06,909
I know a story about a boy
who hated stories.

236
00:16:06,943 --> 00:16:10,313
I could tell you about
Ser Duncan the Tall.

237
00:16:10,347 --> 00:16:12,315
Those were always
your favorites.

238
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,718
Those weren't my favorites.

239
00:16:14,752 --> 00:16:17,388
My favorites were
the scary ones.

240
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:22,994
Oh, my sweet summer child.
What do you know about fear?

241
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:26,264
Fear is for the winter,

242
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:29,268
when the snows fall
a hundred feet deep.

243
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:31,404
Fear is for the long night,

244
00:16:31,438 --> 00:16:34,407
when the sun hides for years

245
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:37,177
and children are born
and live and die

246
00:16:37,212 --> 00:16:39,913
all in darkness.

247
00:16:39,948 --> 00:16:42,983
That is the time for fear,
my little Lord,

248
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:46,353
when the white walkers
move through the woods.

249
00:16:47,722 --> 00:16:50,891
Thousands of years ago
there came a night

250
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,027
that lasted a generation.

251
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:55,997
Kings froze to death
in their castles,

252
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:58,265
same as the shepherds
in their huts.

253
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,169
And women smothered
their babies

254
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:03,338
<i>rather than see them starve,</i>

255
00:17:03,372 --> 00:17:07,375
and wept and felt the tears
freeze on their cheeks.

256
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,113
So is this the sort
of story that you like?

257
00:17:14,151 --> 00:17:16,252
In that darkness,

258
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,789
the White Walkers
came for the first time.

259
00:17:18,823 --> 00:17:21,958
<i>They swept through cities</i>
<i>and kingdoms,</i>

260
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:24,160
<i>riding their dead horses,</i>

261
00:17:24,194 --> 00:17:28,130
hunting with their packs of
pale spiders big as hounds--

263
00:17:32,348 --> 00:17:34,695
What are you telling him now?

264
00:17:34,815 --> 00:17:36,904
Only what what are the little
lord wants to hear.

265
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:42,174
Get your supper.
I want some time with him.

266
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:52,587
- One time she told me

267
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:54,890
the sky is blue because
we live inside the eye

268
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:57,759
of a blue-eyed giant
named Macomber.

269
00:17:57,794 --> 00:18:00,028
Maybe we do.

270
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:04,699
How do you feel?

271
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:10,203
You still don't
remember anything?

272
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,141
Bran,

273
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:16,342
I've seen you climb
a thousand times.

274
00:18:16,377 --> 00:18:18,244
In the wind, in the rain--

275
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:20,379
A thousand times.

276
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:22,781
- You never fall.
- I did though.

277
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:28,019
It's true, isn't it,

278
00:18:28,054 --> 00:18:31,390
what Maester Luwin
says about my legs?

279
00:18:38,865 --> 00:18:40,900
I'd rather be dead.

280
00:18:42,202 --> 00:18:45,406
- Don't ever say that.
- I'd rather be dead.

281
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,689
Fewer eyes back here, My Lady.

282
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,724
But still too many.

283
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:04,393
It's nine years since I've
set foot in the capital.

284
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:07,796
And no one knew who I was the
last time I came either.

285
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,834
My Lady.

286
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:17,137
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
Would you mind following us?

287
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:19,038
I would.
We've done nothing wrong.

288
00:19:19,073 --> 00:19:21,374
We've been instructed to
escort you into the city.

289
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:23,209
Instructed?

290
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:25,946
I don't know who's providing
your instructions, but--

291
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,714
Follow me, Lady Stark.

292
00:19:38,627 --> 00:19:41,430
Cat!
Go on.

293
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:43,298
Go upstairs.

294
00:19:45,502 --> 00:19:48,203
You little worm!

295
00:19:48,238 --> 00:19:51,006
You take me for some
back-alley Sally

296
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,474
you can drag into a--

297
00:19:54,378 --> 00:19:55,978
Pssst!

298
00:19:58,014 --> 00:20:00,049
I meant no disrespect

299
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,451
to you of all people.

300
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:04,619
How dare you bring me here!

301
00:20:04,654 --> 00:20:06,454
Have you lost your mind?

302
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:09,124
No one will come looking for you here.
Isn't that what you wanted?

303
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:12,694
I'm truly sorry
about the locale.

304
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:15,197
How did you know I was
coming to King's Landing?

305
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,300
A dear friend told me.

306
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:22,770
- Lady Stark.
- Lord Varys.

307
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:26,807
To see you again after so
many years is a blessing.

308
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:28,342
Your poor hands.

309
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:32,379
How did you know I was coming?

310
00:20:32,413 --> 00:20:34,881
Knowledge is my trade, My Lady.

312
00:20:36,683 --> 00:20:39,218
Did you bring the dagger
with you, by any chance?

313
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,221
My little birds
are everywhere...

314
00:20:43,255 --> 00:20:45,490
Even in the north.

315
00:20:45,524 --> 00:20:49,060
They whisper to me
the strangest stories.

316
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:56,534
Valyrian steel.

317
00:20:56,568 --> 00:20:59,337
Do you know whose dagger
this is?

318
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,774
I must admit I do not.

319
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:06,677
Well well, this is an historic day.

320
00:21:06,712 --> 00:21:08,813
Something you don't know

321
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:11,315
<i>that I do.</i>

322
00:21:13,284 --> 00:21:17,154
There's only one dagger like this
in all of the Seven Kingdoms.

323
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,158
- It's mine.
- Yours?

324
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:25,762
At least it was, until the tournament
on Prince Joffrey's last nameday.

325
00:21:25,797 --> 00:21:28,632
I bet on Ser Jaime
in the jousting,

326
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,468
as any sane man would.

327
00:21:30,502 --> 00:21:33,003
When the Knight of the
Glowers unseated him,

328
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:35,607
I lost this dagger.

329
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:37,809
To whom?

330
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:39,711
Tyrion Lannister.

331
00:21:39,746 --> 00:21:41,914
The Imp.

332
00:21:41,948 --> 00:21:44,750
<i>Grenn, show him what</i>
<i>you farm boys are made of.</i>

334
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:53,091
- If that were a real sword, you'd be dead.

335
00:21:53,126 --> 00:21:56,394
Lord Snow here
grew up in a castle

336
00:21:56,429 --> 00:21:58,730
spitting down
on the likes of you.

337
00:21:58,764 --> 00:22:00,866
Pyp.

338
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,902
Do you think
Ned Stark's bastard

339
00:22:02,936 --> 00:22:04,971
bleeds like the rest of us?

342
00:22:12,245 --> 00:22:13,913
Next!

343
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:26,126
<i>Next!</i>

344
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:41,440
Well, Lord Snow,

345
00:22:41,474 --> 00:22:43,975
<i>it appears you're</i>
<i>the least useless person here.</i>

346
00:22:45,177 --> 00:22:46,611
Go clean yourselves up.

347
00:22:46,645 --> 00:22:49,548
<i>There's only so much</i>
<i>I can stomach in a day.</i>

348
00:22:49,582 --> 00:22:52,551
A charming man.

349
00:22:52,585 --> 00:22:54,686
<i>I don't need him</i>
<i>to be charming.</i>

350
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,389
I need him to turn this bunch
of thieves and runaways

351
00:22:57,424 --> 00:22:59,258
into men of the Night's Watch.

352
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:02,094
And how's that going,
Commander Mormont?

353
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:04,497
Slowly.

354
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:08,401
A raven came

355
00:23:08,436 --> 00:23:10,337
for Ned Stark's son.

356
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:16,411
Good news or bad?

357
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:18,146
Both.

358
00:23:19,415 --> 00:23:22,583
<i>Lord Stark.</i>

359
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:25,620
I meant to give you this earlier.

360
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:29,958
So forgetful these days.

361
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:34,562
A raven from Winterfell
this morning.

362
00:23:45,272 --> 00:23:47,540
Good news?

363
00:23:50,911 --> 00:23:53,513
Perhaps you'd like to
share it with your wife?

364
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,652
- My wife is in Winterfell.
- Is she?

365
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:08,929
Woman:
<i>Yes, I'm looking at you.</i>

367
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:14,234
I thought that she'd
be safest in here.

368
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:17,170
One of several such
establishments I own.

369
00:24:19,407 --> 00:24:20,875
You're a funny man.

370
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:23,511
Huh?
A very funny man.

371
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,080
Ned!

372
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,491
Ah, the Starks--

373
00:24:35,526 --> 00:24:38,762
Quick tempers, slow minds.

374
00:24:43,535 --> 00:24:46,237
You broke my nose, bastard!

375
00:24:53,478 --> 00:24:55,546
It's an improvement.

376
00:24:58,716 --> 00:25:01,885
If we threw you over the Wall, I wonder
how long it would take you to hit.

377
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,954
I wonder if they'd find you
before the wolves did.

379
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,761
What're you looking at,
Half Man?

380
00:25:10,795 --> 00:25:13,330
I'm looking at you.

381
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:15,632
<i>Yes.</i>

382
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:18,735
<i>You've got an interesting face.</i>

383
00:25:19,737 --> 00:25:22,940
Hmm, very distinctive faces.

384
00:25:22,974 --> 00:25:24,608
All of you.

385
00:25:24,642 --> 00:25:26,844
And what do you care
about our faces?

386
00:25:26,878 --> 00:25:30,080
It's just I think
they would look marvelous

387
00:25:30,115 --> 00:25:32,750
decorating spikes
in King's Landing.

388
00:25:32,784 --> 00:25:35,919
Perhaps I'll write my sister,
the Queen, about it.

389
00:25:38,156 --> 00:25:40,491
We'll talk later, Lord Snow.

390
00:25:46,164 --> 00:25:48,765
Everybody knew
what this place was

391
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,768
and no one told me.

392
00:25:50,802 --> 00:25:53,204
No one but you.

393
00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:55,072
My father knew

394
00:25:55,107 --> 00:25:57,375
and he left me to rot
at the Wall all the same.

395
00:25:57,409 --> 00:25:59,043
Grenn's father left him too...

396
00:25:59,078 --> 00:26:02,414
Outside a farmhouse
when he was three.

397
00:26:02,448 --> 00:26:06,318
<i>Pyp was caught stealing</i>
<i>a wheel of cheese.</i>

398
00:26:06,352 --> 00:26:09,755
His little sister hadn't
eaten in three days.

399
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:13,526
He was given a choice:
his right hand or the Wall.

400
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,094
I've been asking the Lord
Commander about them.

401
00:26:16,129 --> 00:26:17,313
Fascinating stories.

402
00:26:17,433 --> 00:26:19,636
They hate me because
I'm better than they are.

403
00:26:19,756 --> 00:26:21,267
It's a lucky thing
none of them were trained

404
00:26:21,301 --> 00:26:23,836
by a master-at-arms
like your Ser Rodrik.

405
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,705
I don't imagine any of them
have ever held a real sword

406
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:28,841
before they came here.

407
00:26:32,045 --> 00:26:34,012
Oh...

408
00:26:34,047 --> 00:26:37,082
Your brother Bran.

409
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:39,418
He's woken up.

410
00:26:40,687 --> 00:26:42,788
The mere suggestion
that the Queen's brother

411
00:26:42,822 --> 00:26:45,123
tried to kill your boy
would be considered treason.

412
00:26:45,158 --> 00:26:47,393
We have proof.
We have the blade.

413
00:26:47,427 --> 00:26:49,561
Which Lord Tyrion will say
was stolen from him.

414
00:26:49,596 --> 00:26:52,164
The only man who could say
otherwise has no throat,

415
00:26:52,198 --> 00:26:54,432
thanks to your boy's wolf.

416
00:26:54,467 --> 00:26:57,435
Petyr has promised
to help us find the truth.

417
00:26:58,671 --> 00:27:00,572
He's like a little brother
to me, Ned.

418
00:27:00,607 --> 00:27:02,841
He would never betray my trust.

419
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:05,476
I'll try to keep you
alive, for her sake.

420
00:27:05,511 --> 00:27:07,145
A fool's task, admittedly,

421
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:09,947
<i>but I've never been able</i>
<i>to refuse your wife anything.</i>

422
00:27:09,981 --> 00:27:12,115
I won't forget this.

423
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,217
You're a true friend.

424
00:27:14,252 --> 00:27:17,520
Don't tell anyone.
I have a reputation to maintain.

426
00:27:21,692 --> 00:27:24,194
- How could you be so stupid?
- Calm down.

427
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:26,062
He's a child--
10 years old.

428
00:27:26,096 --> 00:27:28,498
- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking of us.

429
00:27:28,532 --> 00:27:31,134
You're a bit late to start
complaining about it now.

430
00:27:31,168 --> 00:27:33,036
- What has the boy told them?
- Nothing.

431
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,038
He's said nothing.
He remembers nothing.

432
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:37,207
Then what are you raving about?

433
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:38,875
What if it comes back to him?

434
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,711
If he tells his father
what he saw--

435
00:27:40,745 --> 00:27:43,180
We'll say he was lying.
We'll say he was dreaming.

436
00:27:43,215 --> 00:27:44,749
We'll say whatever we like.

437
00:27:44,783 --> 00:27:47,051
I think we can outfox
a 10-year-old.

438
00:27:47,086 --> 00:27:50,321
- And my husband?
- I'll go to war with him if I have to.

439
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:53,125
They can write
a ballad about us:

440
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:55,460
"The War for Cersei's Cunt."

442
00:28:00,366 --> 00:28:02,368
- Let me go.
- Never.

443
00:28:02,402 --> 00:28:05,036
- Let me go.
- The boy

444
00:28:05,071 --> 00:28:07,338
won't talk.

445
00:28:07,373 --> 00:28:09,374
And if he does, I'll kill him.

446
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:12,844
Him, Ned Stark, the King--
the whole bloody lot of them,

447
00:28:12,878 --> 00:28:15,713
until you and I are
the only people

448
00:28:15,747 --> 00:28:17,948
left in this world.

449
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:30,393
I wish I could see the girls.

450
00:28:30,428 --> 00:28:33,663
- It's too dangerous.
- Just for a moment.

451
00:28:33,697 --> 00:28:35,965
Until we know
who our enemies are--

452
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,201
I know they did it, Ned.
The Lannisters.

453
00:28:38,235 --> 00:28:40,236
In my bones, I know it.

454
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,271
Littlefinger's right.

455
00:28:43,874 --> 00:28:46,176
I can't do anything
without proof.

456
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,745
And if you find the proof?

457
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:50,980
Then I bring it to Robert...

458
00:28:51,015 --> 00:28:53,784
And hope he's still
the man I once knew.

459
00:28:55,553 --> 00:28:57,554
You watch yourself
on the road, huh?

460
00:28:57,589 --> 00:29:01,025
That temper of yours
is a dangerous thing.

461
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:03,895
My temper?
Gods be good,

462
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,698
you nearly killed poor
Littlefinger yesterday.

463
00:29:11,504 --> 00:29:13,205
He still loves you.

464
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:16,275
Does he?

465
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,493
Off with you.

467
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:10,759
Yes, it's been a long time.

468
00:30:10,794 --> 00:30:14,529
But I still remember
every face.

469
00:30:16,098 --> 00:30:18,232
You remember your first?

470
00:30:20,636 --> 00:30:22,804
Of course, Your Grace.

471
00:30:22,838 --> 00:30:24,873
Who was it?

472
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:27,042
A Tyroshi.

473
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:29,344
- Never learned the name.
- Hmm.

474
00:30:29,378 --> 00:30:31,680
How'd you do it?

475
00:30:31,715 --> 00:30:33,782
Lance through the heart.

476
00:30:33,817 --> 00:30:35,652
<i>Quick one.</i>

477
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:39,389
Lucky for you.

478
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:43,294
Mine was some Tarly boy
at the Battle of Summerhall.

479
00:30:44,763 --> 00:30:47,297
<i>My horse took an arrow</i>
<i>so I was on foot,</i>

480
00:30:47,332 --> 00:30:49,333
<i>slogging through the mud.</i>

481
00:30:50,635 --> 00:30:55,973
He came running at me,
this dumb high-born lad,

482
00:30:56,007 --> 00:30:58,176
thinking he could end
the rebellion

483
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,744
<i>with single swing of his sword.</i>

484
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,081
<i>I knocked him down</i>
<i>with the hammer.</i>

485
00:31:04,116 --> 00:31:06,484
<i>Gods, I was strong then.</i>

486
00:31:06,518 --> 00:31:09,354
Caved in his breastplate.

487
00:31:09,388 --> 00:31:12,557
Probably shattered
every rib he had.

488
00:31:12,592 --> 00:31:16,429
<i>Stood over him,</i>
<i>hammer in the air.</i>

489
00:31:16,463 --> 00:31:20,800
Right before I brought it down
he shouted, "Wait!

490
00:31:20,835 --> 00:31:23,870
Wait."

491
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:31,911
They never tell you
how they all shit themselves.

492
00:31:31,945 --> 00:31:36,481
They don't put that part
in the songs.

493
00:31:39,017 --> 00:31:41,519
Stupid boy.

494
00:31:42,621 --> 00:31:45,223
<i>Now the Tarlys bend the knee</i>

495
00:31:45,257 --> 00:31:47,659
<i>like everyone else.</i>

496
00:31:47,693 --> 00:31:49,828
He could have lingered

497
00:31:49,862 --> 00:31:52,531
on the edge of the battle
with the smart boys

498
00:31:52,565 --> 00:31:56,168
and today his wife would
be making him miserable,

499
00:31:56,203 --> 00:31:59,172
<i>his sons would be ingrates,</i>

500
00:31:59,206 --> 00:32:02,242
and he'd be waking
three times in the night

501
00:32:02,276 --> 00:32:05,178
to piss into a bowl.
Wine!

502
00:32:08,181 --> 00:32:12,785
Lancel.
Gods, what a stupid name.

503
00:32:13,753 --> 00:32:17,356
Lancel Lannister.

504
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:21,560
Who named you?
Some halfwit with a stutter?

506
00:32:23,963 --> 00:32:26,799
What are you doing?

507
00:32:28,201 --> 00:32:30,736
- It's empty, Your Grace.
- What do you mean it's empty?

508
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,605
- There's no more wine.
- Is that what empty means?

509
00:32:35,675 --> 00:32:38,043
So get more.

510
00:32:41,714 --> 00:32:43,948
Tell your cousin
to get in here.

511
00:32:43,982 --> 00:32:45,383
Kingslayer!

512
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:47,452
Get in here.

513
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:58,094
<i>Surrounded by Lannisters.</i>

514
00:32:58,128 --> 00:33:02,365
Every time I close my eyes
I see their blond hair

515
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,668
and their smug,
satisfied faces.

516
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:08,470
It must wound your pride, huh?

517
00:33:08,505 --> 00:33:11,473
Standing out there
like a glorified sentry.

518
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:16,779
Jaime Lannister,
son of the mighty Tywin...

519
00:33:18,048 --> 00:33:20,484
Forced to mind the door
while your King

520
00:33:20,518 --> 00:33:23,487
eats and drinks
and shits and fucks.

521
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,990
So come on.

522
00:33:27,025 --> 00:33:29,125
We're telling war stories.

523
00:33:30,361 --> 00:33:33,997
Who was your first kill,
not counting old men?

524
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,867
One of the outlaws
in the Brotherhood.

525
00:33:37,902 --> 00:33:40,470
I was there that day.

526
00:33:40,504 --> 00:33:43,673
You were only a squire,
16 years old.

527
00:33:43,707 --> 00:33:46,609
You killed Simon Toyne
with a counter riposte.

528
00:33:46,643 --> 00:33:48,911
Best move I ever saw.

529
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:53,182
A good fighter, Toyne,
but he lacked stamina.

530
00:33:53,216 --> 00:33:55,351
<i>Your outlaw...</i>

531
00:33:55,386 --> 00:33:57,954
Any last words?

532
00:33:57,988 --> 00:34:00,823
- I cut his head off, so no.
- Hmmm.

533
00:34:00,858 --> 00:34:03,794
What about Aerys Targaryen?

534
00:34:03,828 --> 00:34:07,764
What did the Mad King say when
you stabbed him in the back?

535
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,867
I never asked.

536
00:34:09,901 --> 00:34:12,937
Did he call you a traitor?

537
00:34:12,971 --> 00:34:16,141
Did he plead for a reprieve?

538
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:20,645
He said the same thing
he'd been saying for hours...

539
00:34:22,315 --> 00:34:24,515
"Burn them all."

540
00:34:29,287 --> 00:34:31,221
If that's all, Your Grace...

542
00:35:03,485 --> 00:35:05,920
Do the Dothraki buy
their slaves?

543
00:35:05,954 --> 00:35:08,089
The Dothraki don't
believe in money.

544
00:35:08,123 --> 00:35:10,424
Most of their slaves were
given to them as gifts.

545
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:12,693
- From whom?
- If you rule a city

546
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:15,662
and you see the horde approaching,
you have two choices:

547
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,530
Pay tribute or fight.

548
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:19,265
An easy choice for most.

549
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:22,802
Of course, sometimes
it's not enough.

550
00:35:22,836 --> 00:35:26,272
Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by
the number of slaves he's given.

551
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:28,875
<i>He might think the men too weak</i>
<i>or the women too ugly.</i>

552
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:32,446
Sometimes a Khal decides his riders
haven't had a good fight in months

553
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,783
- <i>and need the practice.</i>
- <i>Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.</i>

555
00:35:38,154 --> 00:35:40,922
Tell them all to stop.

556
00:35:40,957 --> 00:35:43,091
You want the entire
horde to stop?

557
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:45,460
For how long?

558
00:35:45,494 --> 00:35:48,529
Until I command them otherwise.

559
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,931
You're learning
to talk like a Queen.

560
00:35:50,966 --> 00:35:53,033
Not a Queen.

561
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,969
A Khaleesi.

562
00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:07,749
Annakhas dozgosores.

565
00:36:31,842 --> 00:36:33,943
- You dare!

566
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:37,448
You give commands to me?
To <i>me?</i>

567
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:42,987
You do not command the dragon.
I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

568
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:45,390
I don't take orders
from savages

569
00:36:45,424 --> 00:36:47,925
or their sluts.
Do you hear me?

570
00:36:50,629 --> 00:36:53,131
<i>Hash shafka zali nharees,</i>
<i>zhey Khaleesi?</i>

571
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:55,968
Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.

572
00:36:56,002 --> 00:36:57,470
No.

573
00:36:57,504 --> 00:36:59,505
<i>Ishish chare acharoe</i>
<i>hash me nem éjervae</i>

574
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,608
- <i>nharesoon.</i>
- Rakharo say you should take ear,

575
00:37:02,643 --> 00:37:06,312
- to teach respect.
- Please please, don't hurt him.

576
00:37:10,317 --> 00:37:14,052
Tell him I don't want
my brother harmed.

577
00:37:14,086 --> 00:37:16,954
<i>Khaleesi vos zalo</i>
<i>meme nem azisa.</i>

578
00:37:16,989 --> 00:37:19,390
Huh?

579
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:23,126
- <i>Shafki.</i>

580
00:37:26,865 --> 00:37:30,569
Mormont!
Kill these Dothraki dogs!

581
00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:37,677
I am your King!

582
00:37:39,714 --> 00:37:42,783
Shall we return
to the Khalasar, khaleesi?

583
00:38:02,602 --> 00:38:04,936
Uh uh uh uh uh.

584
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:08,073
You walk.

591
00:40:38,267 --> 00:40:42,736
I wanted to be here when you
saw it for the first time.

592
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:54,181
- I'm leaving this morning.
- You're leaving?

593
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,484
I'm the First Ranger.

594
00:40:57,519 --> 00:40:59,787
My job is out there.

595
00:40:59,821 --> 00:41:03,157
- There have been disturbing reports.
- What kind of reports?

596
00:41:03,191 --> 00:41:05,092
The kind I don't
want to believe.

597
00:41:06,728 --> 00:41:09,230
I'm ready.
I won't let you down.

598
00:41:09,264 --> 00:41:11,799
You're not going.

599
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:16,037
You're no ranger, Jon.

600
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:18,806
- But I'm better than every--
- Better than no one!

601
00:41:23,979 --> 00:41:25,846
Here...

602
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,215
A man gets what he earns,

603
00:41:28,249 --> 00:41:30,417
when he earns it.

604
00:41:34,356 --> 00:41:36,590
We'll speak when I return.

606
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:55,242
- A bear's balls.
- Oh, you're joking?

607
00:41:55,276 --> 00:41:58,813
And his brains and his guts,
his lungs and his heart

608
00:41:58,847 --> 00:42:01,349
all fried in his own fat.

609
00:42:01,383 --> 00:42:03,985
When you're a hundred miles
north of the Wall

610
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,521
and you ate your last meal a week ago,
you leave nothing for the wolves.

611
00:42:07,556 --> 00:42:10,825
And how do
a bear's balls taste?

612
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,161
A bit chewy.

613
00:42:15,264 --> 00:42:18,800
And what about you, My Lord?
What's the strangest thing you've eaten?

614
00:42:18,834 --> 00:42:21,202
Do Dornish girls count?

616
00:42:25,173 --> 00:42:28,308
So you roam the Seven Kingdoms,

617
00:42:28,342 --> 00:42:30,543
collaring pickpockets
and horse thieves

618
00:42:30,577 --> 00:42:32,678
and bringing them here
as eager recruits?

619
00:42:32,713 --> 00:42:34,513
Aye.

620
00:42:34,548 --> 00:42:37,549
But it's not all of 'em's
done bad things.

621
00:42:37,584 --> 00:42:40,585
Some of 'em's just poor lads
looking for steady feed.

622
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,321
Some of 'em's high-born lads
looking for glory.

623
00:42:43,355 --> 00:42:46,891
They have a better chance finding feed
than glory.

624
00:42:46,925 --> 00:42:50,461
The Night's Watch is
a joke to you, is it?

625
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:53,031
Is that what we are, Lannister?

626
00:42:53,065 --> 00:42:55,900
An army of jesters in black?

627
00:42:55,934 --> 00:42:58,069
You don't have enough men
to be an army

628
00:42:58,103 --> 00:43:01,739
and aside from Yoren here, none
of you are particularly funny.

629
00:43:01,774 --> 00:43:04,509
<i>I hope we've provided you</i>
<i>with some good stories to tell</i>

630
00:43:04,544 --> 00:43:06,478
<i>when you're back</i>
<i>in King's Landing.</i>

631
00:43:06,513 --> 00:43:08,047
But something to think about

632
00:43:08,081 --> 00:43:10,182
while you're drinking
your wine down there,

633
00:43:10,217 --> 00:43:12,151
enjoying your brothels--

634
00:43:12,186 --> 00:43:16,523
Half the boys you've seen training
will die north of the Wall.

635
00:43:16,558 --> 00:43:20,027
<i>Might be a wilding's axe</i>
<i>that gets them,</i>

636
00:43:20,061 --> 00:43:22,729
<i>might be sickness,</i>

637
00:43:22,764 --> 00:43:25,598
might just be the cold.

638
00:43:25,633 --> 00:43:28,334
They die in pain.

639
00:43:28,368 --> 00:43:31,904
And they do it so plump
little lords like you

640
00:43:31,938 --> 00:43:35,407
can enjoy their summer
afternoons in peace and comfort.

641
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:39,410
Do you think I'm plump?

642
00:43:43,148 --> 00:43:45,549
Listen, Benjen--
May I call you Benjen?

643
00:43:45,584 --> 00:43:46,770
<i>Call me what you like.</i>

644
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,201
<i>I'm not sure what I've</i>
<i>done to offend you.</i>

645
00:43:49,321 --> 00:43:51,489
I have great admiration
for the Night's Watch.

646
00:43:51,523 --> 00:43:54,092
I've great admiration
for you as First Ranger.

647
00:43:54,126 --> 00:43:56,160
You know, my brother
once told me

648
00:43:56,195 --> 00:43:58,797
that nothing someone says
before the word "but"

649
00:43:58,831 --> 00:44:00,731
really counts.

650
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:03,268
But...

651
00:44:03,302 --> 00:44:06,537
I don't believe that giants
and ghouls and White Walkers

652
00:44:06,571 --> 00:44:08,372
are lurking beyond the Wall.

653
00:44:08,406 --> 00:44:10,774
I believe that
the only difference

654
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:13,076
between us and
the wildlings is that

655
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,445
when the Wall went up,
our ancestors happened

656
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,713
to live on
the right side of it.

657
00:44:17,748 --> 00:44:19,648
You're right.

658
00:44:21,251 --> 00:44:23,352
The wildlings are
no different from us.

659
00:44:23,386 --> 00:44:26,255
A little rougher maybe.

660
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:29,058
But they're made
of meat and bone.

661
00:44:29,093 --> 00:44:31,695
I know how to track them
and I know how to kill them.

662
00:44:31,729 --> 00:44:35,666
It's not the wildlings
giving me sleepless nights.

663
00:44:36,802 --> 00:44:38,970
You've never been
north of the Wall,

664
00:44:39,004 --> 00:44:41,406
so don't tell me
what's out there.

665
00:44:44,911 --> 00:44:46,945
Are you going below?

666
00:44:48,447 --> 00:44:51,816
- Keep well, keep warm.
- Enjoy the capital, brother.

667
00:44:51,851 --> 00:44:54,352
Oh, I always do.

668
00:45:02,695 --> 00:45:04,963
I think he's starting
to like me.

670
00:45:07,701 --> 00:45:11,170
- "Going below"?
- Aye.

671
00:45:11,205 --> 00:45:12,839
Into the tunnel

672
00:45:12,873 --> 00:45:15,009
and out the other side.

673
00:45:15,043 --> 00:45:17,779
He'll be north of the Wall
for a month or two.

674
00:45:19,915 --> 00:45:23,084
So you're heading down
to King's Landing too.

675
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,687
Aye, day after tomorrow.

676
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:29,525
I get about half of my
recruits from their dungeons.

677
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:33,829
Let's share the road.
I could use some decent company.

678
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:38,902
I... I travel a bit
on the grubby side, My Lord.

679
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:42,940
Not this time. We'll be staying at
the finest castles and inns.

680
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:45,709
No one turns away a Lannister.

681
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,482
At Jakar?

682
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,317
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

683
00:45:55,351 --> 00:45:57,586
Ath ja haker.

684
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,554
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

685
00:45:59,588 --> 00:46:01,456
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

686
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:03,257
Yes, Khaleesi.

687
00:46:05,027 --> 00:46:07,261
Oh, what are you doing?

688
00:46:07,296 --> 00:46:09,897
When was last time
you bleed, Khaleesi?

689
00:46:12,334 --> 00:46:14,368
You change, Khaleesi.

691
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:26,282
For a man on horseback,
the curved blade

692
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:28,818
is a good thing,
easier to handle.

693
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:32,322
It's a good weapon
for a Dothrakan.

694
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:35,125
But a man in full plate--

695
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,960
<i>Shori tawakof</i>

696
00:46:36,995 --> 00:46:39,963
the <i>arakh</i> won't get
through the steel.

697
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:43,300
That's where the broadsword
has the advantage.

698
00:46:43,335 --> 00:46:46,337
Designed for piercing plate.

700
00:46:50,508 --> 00:46:53,743
- Armor.
- Armor.

701
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:56,412
Armor make a man...

702
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,580
- <i>Vroz?</i>
- Slow.

703
00:46:58,614 --> 00:47:00,548
- Slow.
- It's true,

704
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:03,884
but it also keeps a man alive.

705
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:24,306
He still is.

706
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,809
A man of great honor

707
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,811
and I betrayed him.

708
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:54,904
I don't think
she wants to eat dog.

709
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:00,943
The Khaleesi
have baby inside her.

710
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:05,649
<i>It is true.</i>
<i>She does not bleed for two moons.</i>

711
00:48:05,683 --> 00:48:08,218
<i>Her belly start to swell.</i>

712
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:14,058
- <i>She does not want to eat horse.</i>

713
00:48:15,461 --> 00:48:18,364
I'll have the boys
butcher a goat for supper.

715
00:48:23,537 --> 00:48:26,205
I need to ride to Qohor.

716
00:48:29,142 --> 00:48:33,145
Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak.

717
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,514
Don't worry.
I'll catch you.

718
00:48:35,548 --> 00:48:37,983
The horde's easy to find.

720
00:48:48,461 --> 00:48:50,362
Don't stand so still.

721
00:48:50,396 --> 00:48:53,932
It's harder to hit
a moving target.

722
00:48:58,104 --> 00:49:00,939
Except for you.
You move too much.

723
00:49:00,973 --> 00:49:03,675
I could just hold my sword out
and let you do the work for me.

724
00:49:08,847 --> 00:49:11,815
<i>How many winters have</i>
<i>you seen, Lord Tyrion?</i>

725
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:14,484
Eight-- no, nine.

726
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:17,053
All of them brief?

727
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:20,322
They say the winter of my birth was
three years long, Maester Aemon.

728
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:23,392
This summer has lasted nine.

729
00:49:23,426 --> 00:49:27,762
But reports from the Citadel
tell us the days grow shorter.

730
00:49:27,796 --> 00:49:30,231
The Starks are always
right eventually:

731
00:49:30,265 --> 00:49:33,234
Winter is coming.

732
00:49:33,268 --> 00:49:36,069
This one will be long

733
00:49:36,103 --> 00:49:38,805
and dark things
will come with it.

734
00:49:38,839 --> 00:49:41,908
We've been capturing wildlings,

735
00:49:41,942 --> 00:49:44,977
more every month.
They're fleeing south.

736
00:49:45,012 --> 00:49:49,249
<i>The ones who flee say they've seen</i>
<i>the White Walkers.</i>

737
00:49:49,283 --> 00:49:52,687
Yes, and the fishermen of
Lannisport say they see mermaids.

738
00:49:52,721 --> 00:49:56,124
One of our own rangers swore he
saw them kill his companions.

739
00:49:56,158 --> 00:49:58,226
He swore it right up
to the moment

740
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:00,162
Ned Stark chopped his head off.

741
00:50:00,196 --> 00:50:02,832
<i>The Night's Watch</i>
<i>is the only thing</i>

742
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:04,900
standing between the realm

743
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:07,202
and what lies beyond.

744
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:09,438
<i>And it has has become an army</i>

745
00:50:09,472 --> 00:50:13,074
of undisciplined boys
and tired old men.

746
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:16,643
There are less than
a thousand of us now.

747
00:50:16,678 --> 00:50:19,513
We can't man the other
castles on the Wall.

748
00:50:19,547 --> 00:50:22,649
<i>We can't properly</i>
<i>patrol the wilderness.</i>

749
00:50:22,683 --> 00:50:26,352
We've barely enough resources
to keep our lads armed

750
00:50:26,387 --> 00:50:29,022
- and fed.
- Your sister

751
00:50:29,056 --> 00:50:31,858
sits by the side the King.

752
00:50:31,893 --> 00:50:34,761
Tell her we need help.

753
00:50:34,796 --> 00:50:37,131
<i>When winter does come,</i>

754
00:50:37,165 --> 00:50:40,601
gods help us all
if we're not ready.

756
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:49,773
I'm sorry to see
you leave, Lannister.

757
00:51:51,509 --> 00:51:53,444
It's either me or this cold.

758
00:51:53,478 --> 00:51:55,846
And <i>it</i> doesn't appear
to be going anywhere.

759
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,849
Will you stop at Winterfell
on your way South?

760
00:51:58,884 --> 00:52:00,117
I expect I will.

761
00:52:00,151 --> 00:52:02,186
Gods know there aren't
many feather beds

762
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,354
between here
and King's Landing.

763
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:06,523
If you see my brother Bran,

764
00:52:06,558 --> 00:52:09,093
tell him I miss him.

765
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:11,161
Tell him I'd visit if I could.

766
00:52:11,195 --> 00:52:12,763
Of course.

767
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:15,366
He'll never walk again.

768
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,067
If you're going to be
a cripple,

769
00:52:17,101 --> 00:52:19,336
it's better to be a rich cripple.

770
00:52:19,371 --> 00:52:21,839
You take care, Snow.

771
00:52:21,873 --> 00:52:23,874
Farewell, My Lord.

772
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:38,188
You are late, boy.

773
00:52:40,057 --> 00:52:42,558
<i>Tomorrow you will</i>
<i>be here at midday.</i>

774
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:44,826
Who are you?

775
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:47,329
Your dancing master,

776
00:52:47,363 --> 00:52:48,931
<i>Syrio Forel.</i>

777
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:54,536
Tomorrow you will catch it.

778
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:56,572
Now pick it up.

779
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:01,177
That is not the way, boy.

780
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:05,382
This is not a greatsword that is
needing two hands to swing it.

781
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:09,553
- It's too heavy.
- It is heavy as it needs to be

782
00:53:09,588 --> 00:53:11,456
to make you strong.

783
00:53:12,358 --> 00:53:13,892
Just so.

784
00:53:13,926 --> 00:53:16,361
One hand is all that is needed.

785
00:53:17,597 --> 00:53:19,732
Now you are standing all wrong.

786
00:53:19,766 --> 00:53:22,135
Turn your body sideface.

787
00:53:22,169 --> 00:53:24,604
Yes.

788
00:53:24,638 --> 00:53:26,807
So.

789
00:53:26,841 --> 00:53:29,175
You are skinny.
That is good.

790
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:32,212
The target is smaller.

791
00:53:32,246 --> 00:53:34,314
Now the grip--
Let me see.

792
00:53:34,348 --> 00:53:37,116
Yes.

793
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:39,986
The grip must be delicate.

794
00:53:40,954 --> 00:53:42,855
What if I drop it?

795
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,224
The steel must be
part of your arm.

796
00:53:45,258 --> 00:53:47,994
Can you drop
part of your arm? No.

797
00:53:48,028 --> 00:53:52,264
Nine years Syrio Forel was first
sword to the Sealord of Braavos.

798
00:53:52,299 --> 00:53:55,067
He knows these things.
You must listen to me, boy.

799
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:56,869
I'm a girl.

800
00:53:56,903 --> 00:54:00,473
Boy, girl--
you are a sword,

801
00:54:00,507 --> 00:54:03,409
that is all.

802
00:54:03,443 --> 00:54:05,845
That is the grip.

803
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,048
You are not holding
a battle-axe.

804
00:54:08,082 --> 00:54:10,417
- You are holding--
- A needle.

805
00:54:10,452 --> 00:54:11,452
Ahhh.

807
00:54:13,121 --> 00:54:15,723
Just so.

808
00:54:15,758 --> 00:54:18,593
Now we will begin the dance.

809
00:54:18,628 --> 00:54:20,095
Remember, child,

810
00:54:20,129 --> 00:54:23,098
this is not the dance of the
Westeros we are learning--

811
00:54:23,132 --> 00:54:25,267
The knight's dance,

812
00:54:25,301 --> 00:54:27,702
hacking and hammering.

813
00:54:27,737 --> 00:54:30,872
This is the Bravo's dance...

814
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:34,342
The water dance.

815
00:54:34,376 --> 00:54:36,611
It is swift

816
00:54:36,645 --> 00:54:38,913
and sudden.

817
00:54:40,382 --> 00:54:42,683
All men are made of water,

818
00:54:42,718 --> 00:54:44,452
do you know this?

819
00:54:44,486 --> 00:54:46,788
If you pierce them,

820
00:54:46,822 --> 00:54:50,591
the water leaks out
and they die.

821
00:54:51,759 --> 00:54:55,095
Now you will try to strike me.

823
00:54:58,132 --> 00:54:59,932
Ha!

824
00:55:11,646 --> 00:55:13,146
Up!

826
00:55:16,517 --> 00:55:17,617
Ha!

827
00:55:28,862 --> 00:55:30,229
Ah.

828
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:34,233
Dead.

829
00:55:34,267 --> 00:55:35,367
Oh!

830
00:55:35,402 --> 00:55:37,002
Dead.

831
00:55:37,037 --> 00:55:39,071
<i>- Hup!</i>

832
00:55:41,641 --> 00:55:43,642
Very dead.

833
00:55:43,676 --> 00:55:46,211
Come.

834
00:55:46,245 --> 00:55:48,113
Ah ah ah!

835
00:55:48,147 --> 00:55:51,116
- <i>Hup!</i>

836
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:53,151
Again, faster.

837
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:00,091
Ah.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
