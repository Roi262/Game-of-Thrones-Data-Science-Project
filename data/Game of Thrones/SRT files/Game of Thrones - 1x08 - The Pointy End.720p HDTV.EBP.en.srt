1
00:00:00,586 --> 00:00:02,814
Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke

2
00:00:03,273 --> 00:00:05,255
informing my father
of my victory here.

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,965
And one to my sister.

4
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:10,303
Inform her that she's to bring
500 men to Winterfell.

5
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:14,014
- When do we sail for King's Landing?
- Soon as I've consolidated my troops.

6
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,642
And you lead the fleet
into Blackwater Bay.

7
00:00:17,015 --> 00:00:20,938
The fist of the First Men.
Thousands of years ago they stood here.

8
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,981
They came here
to get away from something.

9
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,441
I don't think it worked.

10
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,777
Do you think
I'll let you ship Myrcella off to Dorne?

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,987
Dorne is the safest place for her.

12
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,698
I want you to know
what it's like to love someone,

13
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,659
to truly love someone

14
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,647
before I take her from you.

15
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,038
You let a halfwit escape
with a cripple?

16
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,289
And Rickon, too?

17
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,633
Gone, along with the wildling woman.

18
00:00:41,883 --> 00:00:43,251
Wait, I know that farm.

19
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,492
- They'll give us some food.
- We can't risk it.

20
00:00:45,854 --> 00:00:47,423
I've been treating your wounded men.

21
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,550
I've already run through the supplies.

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,635
You're riding to the Crag
to a surrender.

23
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,693
Come with me to the Crag.
Let the Maester show you his stores.

24
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,896
Should have took me.

25
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:05,801
They want your head.

26
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:08,408
Old Lord Karstark
doesn't seem to like me.

27
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:11,529
You strangled his son
with your chains.

28
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:14,407
- He was in my way.
- You are a man without honor.

29
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,533
Your sword.

30
00:01:18,518 --> 00:01:19,955
You have my dragons?

31
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,416
I'll take you to the House of the Undying
where I have put them.

32
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:27,833
Your dragons wait for you
in the House of the Undying.

33
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:30,924
I told you what would happen
if you served me loyally

34
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,051
and what would happen
if you did not.

35
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,532
What have you done?

36
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:38,014
If there are any among you who question
whether your lord means what he says...

37
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:46,142
- Rider approaching!
- Open the gate!

38
00:04:14,642 --> 00:04:16,892
Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell.

39
00:04:18,355 --> 00:04:20,755
- Envy isn't attractive.
- What envy?

40
00:04:21,438 --> 00:04:23,690
You should be proud
of your brother's achievement.

41
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,725
I took the great castle
of Winterfell with 20 men.

42
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,425
You're a great warrior.
I saw the bodies above your gates.

43
00:04:31,123 --> 00:04:34,772
Which one gave you the tougher fight,
the cripple or the six-year-old?

44
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:40,674
I treated the Stark boys with honor
and they repaid me with treachery.

45
00:04:40,924 --> 00:04:43,992
You treated them with honor
by butchering them?

46
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,412
- Before I had to kill them...
- You seized their home.

47
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,039
We're Ironborn;
We take what we need.

48
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:51,039
Exactly.

49
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:54,398
Then you made them prisoners in
their home and they ran away.

50
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,934
Is that treachery?
I'd call it bravery.

51
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,064
They made me a promise...

52
00:05:00,314 --> 00:05:03,387
Your prisoners made you a promise
and you got mad when they broke it?

53
00:05:04,515 --> 00:05:05,681
Are you the dumbest cunt?

54
00:05:06,398 --> 00:05:08,183
- Don't call me a...
- A cunt.

55
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,833
A dumb cunt who killed
the only two Starks in Winterfell.

56
00:05:12,725 --> 00:05:14,689
You know how valuable
those boys were?

57
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,354
If I hadn't killed them, the
Northerners would think me weak.

58
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:18,754
You are weak.

59
00:05:19,426 --> 00:05:21,404
- I'm warning you.
- And you're stupid.

60
00:05:23,302 --> 00:05:24,402
Go on, then,

61
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:25,949
warn me.

62
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:32,228
You haven't brought enough men.

63
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:34,664
How am I supposed to defend
Winterfell with just this lot?

64
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:35,877
You're not.

65
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:39,223
I've come to bring you home.
- Father wants a word.

66
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,967
Is this a joke?
Winterfell is the heart of the North.

67
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:45,380
Aye, it is,
hundreds of miles from the sea.

68
00:05:46,191 --> 00:05:47,639
We're islanders, baby brother.

69
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,144
Had you forgotten that?

70
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:51,444
Our power comes from our ships.

71
00:05:52,242 --> 00:05:55,605
And now that you'vedecorated your walls
with the bodies of the Stark boys,

72
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,755
every man in the North
wants to see you hanged.

73
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,800
- When Robb Stark finds out...
- He won't.

74
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:05,818
We've killed all the ravens.
We have all the horses.

75
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:09,035
I've taken Winterfell.

76
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:10,996
And I

77
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,796
will keep Winterfell.

78
00:06:16,054 --> 00:06:17,001
Leave us.

79
00:06:30,785 --> 00:06:32,435
Theon, you're my blood.

80
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,991
We both loved our mother.

81
00:06:36,784 --> 00:06:39,564
We both endured our father.

82
00:06:41,724 --> 00:06:43,865
Come home with me.
Don't die here alone.

83
00:06:44,115 --> 00:06:45,715
I don't intend to die.

84
00:06:51,526 --> 00:06:53,455
You were a terrible baby,
do you know that?

85
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,865
Bawling all the time, never sleeping.

86
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:02,035
And one night you just
wouldn't shut up,

87
00:07:02,285 --> 00:07:04,135
screaming like a dying pig.

88
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:09,266
I walked over to your crib,
I looked down at you.

89
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:11,769
I wanted to strangle you.

90
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,936
And you looked up at me
and you stopped screaming.

91
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,036
You smiled at me.

92
00:07:24,326 --> 00:07:26,294
Don't die so far from the sea.

93
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:44,251
I've brought you a present,
Lord of Bones.

94
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,499
I already got one crow.
Don't need two.

95
00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:50,701
Mance will want to question this one.

96
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:53,518
Knows all about where the crows
are and what they're planning.

97
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:57,129
The Halfhand knows more.
This one is just a little boy.

98
00:07:57,637 --> 00:07:58,395
Gut him.

99
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,277
He could have killed me
half a dozen times.

100
00:08:01,527 --> 00:08:02,774
And now he wishes he did.

101
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,067
Gut him.

102
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:08,198
He's a bastard of Winterfell,
Ned Stark's son.

103
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,116
Mance will want him.

104
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,787
What does Mance want
with a dead man's bastard?

105
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:18,164
I don't know.

106
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:21,334
I think he'll want
to decide for himself.

107
00:08:27,702 --> 00:08:31,219
He runs, I'll chop his balls off.

108
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,889
He runs, I'll do it meself.

109
00:08:41,703 --> 00:08:43,356
We're even now, Jon Snow.

110
00:08:57,381 --> 00:08:58,731
I couldn't do it.

111
00:08:59,652 --> 00:09:02,302
- I had the sword at her neck...
- I know.

112
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:04,440
The others?

113
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,838
When you didn't come back,
we went looking for you.

114
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,810
We found your tracks fast enough.

115
00:09:10,355 --> 00:09:12,805
But they found us
before we found you.

116
00:09:14,113 --> 00:09:15,305
They died because of me.

117
00:09:17,104 --> 00:09:18,789
See that it wasn't for nothing.

118
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,160
Come on, on your feet, now.

119
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,267
Is she beautiful?

120
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:34,176
I've never met her.

121
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:36,473
What's her name?

122
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:39,663
Frey, I suppose.
I don't know her first name.

123
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:43,194
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

124
00:09:47,272 --> 00:09:50,922
- And you're marrying her for a bridge?
- An important bridge.

125
00:09:52,473 --> 00:09:54,773
It was before they killed my father.

126
00:09:55,849 --> 00:09:58,498
I still thought I could march south
and rescue him in time,

127
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:00,517
but only if I crossed that bridge.

128
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:07,203
When I speak to people from the North,
they all loved your father.

129
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:11,377
He was the best man I ever met.

130
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:14,211
I know children always think
that about their fathers, but--

131
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:18,492
Children do not always think that
about their fathers, believe me.

132
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,650
He once told me that being
a Lord is like being a father,

133
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:28,224
except you have thousands of children
and you worry about all of them.

134
00:10:28,747 --> 00:10:31,478
The farmers plowing
the fields are yours to protect.

135
00:10:31,728 --> 00:10:34,702
The charwomen scrubbing the floors,
yours to protect.

136
00:10:34,952 --> 00:10:37,202
The soldiers you order into battle.

137
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,708
He told me he woke
with fear in the morning

138
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,091
and went to bed
with fear in the night.

139
00:10:45,037 --> 00:10:46,587
I didn't believe him.

140
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,017
I asked him,

141
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:52,817
"how can a man be brave
if he's afraid?"

142
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,073
"That is the only time
a man can be brave," he told me.

143
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:02,243
I wish I could have met him.

144
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:05,289
He would have liked you.

145
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:12,339
Most Lords worry more about their gold
and their glory than the charwomen .

146
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,856
He didn't care much
about gold or glory.

147
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:16,289
And you?

148
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:19,843
You think I'm fighting this war so
they'll sing songs about me?

149
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:22,474
I want to go home.

150
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:26,936
- I want  my men to go home.
- Then why don't you?

151
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,589
Because we'll never be safe until
the Lannisters are defeated.

152
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:34,652
- And because I believe in justice.
- Chopping of Joffrey's head, you mean.

153
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,488
That would be a start.

154
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,834
Your Grace, Milady.
The Kingslayer,

155
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,837
- he escaped in the night.
- How?

156
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,340
How?!

157
00:12:01,394 --> 00:12:02,975
Tell me this isn't true.

158
00:12:07,904 --> 00:12:09,104
Why?

159
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:13,411
- For the girls.
- You betrayed me.

160
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,356
You knew I would not allow it
and you did it anyway.

161
00:12:19,602 --> 00:12:23,084
Bran and Rickon
are captives in Winterfell.

162
00:12:23,334 --> 00:12:26,154
Sansa and Arya are captives
in King's Landing.

163
00:12:26,404 --> 00:12:28,886
I have five children,
and only one of them is free.

164
00:12:29,136 --> 00:12:32,559
I lost one son fighting
by your son's side.

165
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:36,315
I lost another to the Kingslayer,
strangled with a chain.

166
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:41,511
You commit treason
because your children are prisoners?

167
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,399
I would carve out my heart

168
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:46,868
and offer it to the Father
if he would let my sons

169
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:50,195
wake from their graves
and step into a prison cell.

170
00:12:50,445 --> 00:12:51,873
I grieve for your sons, My Lord.

171
00:12:52,123 --> 00:12:54,432
I don't want your grief.
I want my vengeance.

172
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:57,178
And you stole it from me.

173
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:02,358
Killing Jaime Lannister
would not buy life for your children,

174
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,103
but returning him to King's Landing
may buy life for mine.

175
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,914
Jaime Lannister
has played you for a fool.

176
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:13,195
You've weakened our position.

177
00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:14,961
You've brought discord into our camp.

178
00:13:16,114 --> 00:13:18,117
And you did it all behind my back.

179
00:13:21,887 --> 00:13:23,802
Make sure she's guarded
day and night.

180
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:26,776
How many men did we send
in pursuit of the Kingslayer?

181
00:13:27,026 --> 00:13:28,044
40, Your Grace.

182
00:13:28,294 --> 00:13:31,226
Send another 40
with our fastest horses.

183
00:13:50,584 --> 00:13:51,598
Damn.

184
00:13:55,371 --> 00:13:58,128
You're much uglier in daylight.
What's your name?

185
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:04,219
I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock,
son of Tywin.

186
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:09,347
A captive Knight has a right
to know his captor's identity.

187
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:11,454
Brienne of Tarth.

188
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:13,258
Tarth, Tarth, Tarth.

189
00:14:13,508 --> 00:14:16,147
Crescent moons and starbursts.

190
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:21,131
Lord... Selwyn Tarth, your father.

191
00:14:22,847 --> 00:14:25,432
Do you have any brothers
and sisters, My Lady?

192
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:28,503
It's a long way to King's Landing.

193
00:14:29,137 --> 00:14:31,354
Might as well
get to know one another.

194
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:33,408
Have you known many men?

195
00:14:33,658 --> 00:14:34,707
I suppose not.

196
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:36,448
Women?

197
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:37,543
Horses?

198
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,588
I didn't mean to give offense.
Forgive me.

199
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:44,586
Your crimes are past forgiveness,
Kingslayer.

200
00:14:44,836 --> 00:14:46,302
Why do you hate me so much?

201
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,971
- Have I ever harmed you?
- You've harmed others...

202
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:53,212
those you were sworn to protect,
the weak, the innocent.

203
00:14:53,462 --> 00:14:56,486
Has anyone ever told you
you're as boring as you are ugly?

204
00:14:56,736 --> 00:14:59,200
You will not provoke me to anger.

205
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,736
I already have.
Look at you.

206
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:03,486
You're ready to chop my head off.

207
00:15:04,516 --> 00:15:06,222
Do you think you could?

208
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,376
Do you think you could
beat me in a fair fight?

209
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:10,110
I've never seen you fight.

210
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,036
The answer is no.

211
00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:15,649
There are three men in the kingdoms
who might have a chance against me.

212
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,125
You're not one of them.

213
00:15:17,623 --> 00:15:20,559
All my life men like you
have sneered at me.

214
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:23,342
And all my life I've been knocking
men like you into the dust.

215
00:15:23,592 --> 00:15:26,060
If you're so confident,
unlock my chains.

216
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,830
Let's see what happens.

217
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,596
Do you take me for an idiot? In.

218
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:35,958
I took you for a fighter,

219
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:39,722
a man... pardon... woman of honor.

220
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:41,988
Was I wrong?

221
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:43,970
You're afraid.

222
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:49,201
Maybe one day
we'll find out, Kingslayer.

223
00:16:02,597 --> 00:16:06,592
King's Landing will fall an hour
after Stannis lands his force.

224
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:12,771
It's not too late for Joffrey and Cersei
and the court to ride west to safety.

225
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:15,108
Surrender the Iron Throne?

226
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:18,513
Better than seeing their heads
mounted on the city gates.

227
00:16:18,763 --> 00:16:20,980
Stannis will execute them all.

228
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,264
No, a king who runs
will not be king for long.

229
00:16:24,453 --> 00:16:26,819
He's a Lannister.
He'll stand and fight.

230
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:32,325
Stannis, two days from the capital
and the wolf at my doorstep.

231
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:36,062
The scouts assure us Robb Stark
remains north of Ashemark.

232
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,705
The last time the scouts
assured us of Stark's movement,

233
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:41,458
he lured us into a trap.

234
00:16:43,286 --> 00:16:45,748
Which is why my son is his prisoner.

235
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,427
Too close to Casterly Rock.

236
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:56,493
He sent a splinter force
to recapture Winterfell.

237
00:16:57,323 --> 00:16:59,102
The Greyjoys
have done us a great favor.

238
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,230
Stark won't risk
marching on Casterly Rock

239
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,909
until he's at full force.

240
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:06,234
He's a boy
and he's never lost a battle.

241
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,113
He'll risk anything at any time

242
00:17:11,187 --> 00:17:13,491
because he doesn't know
enough to be afraid.

243
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:23,175
We'll ride at nightfall.

244
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:26,254
I want a full night's march
before he knows we're on the move.

245
00:17:26,725 --> 00:17:30,115
Clegane, you'll maintain
a garrison here at Harrenhal.

246
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,337
Track down this brotherhood
and destroy them.

247
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,722
The girl has proven
herself a good servant.

248
00:17:38,972 --> 00:17:40,538
She'll stay on with you.

249
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:43,356
See that he doesn't get
drunk in the evenings.

250
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:48,568
He's poor company when he's sober,
but he's better at his work.

251
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,209
You've got some questions to answer.

252
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:00,139
Who killed Ser Amory?

253
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:01,979
- I don't know!
- Give me the name.

254
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:03,749
Take this one out for the crows.

255
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,120
I told you, I don't know.

256
00:18:07,936 --> 00:18:09,008
Please.

257
00:18:10,071 --> 00:18:14,203
Look, it's Yoren's little cunt.
Used to be a boy, now it's a girl.

258
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,180
Where's Jaqen?

259
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,500
Don't care.

260
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,101
Where's your stick now, bitch?

261
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,167
I promised to fuck you with it.

262
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,382
Time to kill some wolves.

263
00:18:35,831 --> 00:18:37,825
You need sour cherries
to make it right.

264
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,995
And the secret is you dry the stones,
and then you break them with a mallet.

265
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,228
That's where the real flavor is.
You crush 'em up real fine.

266
00:18:44,478 --> 00:18:46,792
And when you're finished,
you sprinkle them over the piecrust.

267
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,661
- Where's Jaqen?
- How would I know?

268
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:51,547
I need him now.
Lord Tywin's marching tonight.

269
00:18:52,225 --> 00:18:53,216
You need him?

270
00:18:53,774 --> 00:18:54,930
He's helping me.

271
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,178
- I saw him.
- Where?

272
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,474
Where?

273
00:19:02,254 --> 00:19:04,518
They went riding out the gates
a few hours ago.

274
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,279
On patrol.
Let go of my ears.

275
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,695
What do you want with him anyway?

276
00:19:30,374 --> 00:19:32,421
Mance is gonna march on the Wall.

277
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,595
When he does, one brother inside his army
will be worth 1,000 fighting against it.

278
00:19:36,845 --> 00:19:38,713
- They'll never trust me.
- They might...

279
00:19:38,963 --> 00:19:40,714
- If you do what needs to be done.
- What?

280
00:19:40,964 --> 00:19:43,431
How does it feel
knowing those men all died

281
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:46,109
so you could skip through the snow
with your little savage girl?

282
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,158
I didn't.

283
00:19:47,408 --> 00:19:49,813
I should have known better,
trusting a traitor's bastard.

284
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,534
He's not yours to kill, crow.

285
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,536
Do you have to do that here?

286
00:20:23,918 --> 00:20:25,760
I like to keep me hands clean.

287
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:29,069
Yes, but do you have to do it here?

288
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,392
- Start wearing the gold cloak.
- I don't want to wear a gold cloak.

289
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:43,523
You're commander of the City Watch.

290
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,307
- You shouldn't be dressed like a sellsword.
- A cloak slows you down in a fight,

291
00:20:47,557 --> 00:20:49,535
makes it hard to move quietly.

292
00:20:49,785 --> 00:20:53,301
And the gold catches the light, so
you're nice and easy to spot at night.

293
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:56,407
Well, you're not sneaking
through alleyways any longer.

294
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,278
- You're supposed to stand out.
- We had a deal.

295
00:20:59,528 --> 00:21:02,887
- And wearing a cloak wasn't part of it.
- Fine, fine.

296
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,407
No gold cloak.

297
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,182
- What?
- What?

298
00:21:16,432 --> 00:21:18,527
What? What?
Why are you staring at me?

299
00:21:20,002 --> 00:21:23,074
You don't want me cleaning me nails.
You don't want me looking your way.

300
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:25,053
Why am I here?

301
00:21:25,303 --> 00:21:28,276
To help me plan the defense
of King's Landing.

302
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,621
Stannis will be here any day.

303
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:36,170
And one of these
explains how to beat him?

304
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:40,694
"An History
of the Great Sieges of Westeros"

305
00:21:40,944 --> 00:21:43,353
by Archmaester "Shevelathin."

306
00:21:44,384 --> 00:21:45,634
"Shevelatesh."

307
00:21:45,884 --> 00:21:46,885
"Chevalteesh."

308
00:21:50,699 --> 00:21:53,455
I'd swap all your books
for a few good archers.

309
00:21:53,705 --> 00:21:55,645
My Lord Hand, Commander.

310
00:21:55,895 --> 00:21:57,232
I must compliment you

311
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,527
on the Gold Cloaks' performance
these last few weeks.

312
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:04,363
Did you know there has been
a marked drop in thievery?

313
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,271
I did not know.

314
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:10,830
And how did you accomplish
this marked drop in thievery?

315
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:14,041
Me and the lads rounded up
all the known thieves.

316
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:16,910
For questioning?

317
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,187
Uh, no.

318
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,697
It's the unknown thieves
we need to worry about now.

319
00:22:21,947 --> 00:22:24,371
- We talked about this.
- Aye, we talked about it.

320
00:22:25,003 --> 00:22:27,351
Have you ever been
in a city under siege?

321
00:22:28,151 --> 00:22:30,026
Maybe this part's not in your books.

322
00:22:30,714 --> 00:22:32,709
See, it's not the fighting
that kills most people.

323
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:36,078
It's the starving.
Food's worth more than gold.

324
00:22:36,328 --> 00:22:39,479
Noble ladies sell their diamonds
for a sack of potatoes.

325
00:22:40,176 --> 00:22:43,404
Things get bad enough,
the poor start eating each other.

326
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:46,451
The thieves, they love a siege.

327
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:49,471
Soon as the gates are sealed,
they steal all the food.

328
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:52,288
By the time it's all over,
they're the richest men in town.

329
00:22:54,174 --> 00:22:55,734
Given the circumstances, My Lord,

330
00:22:55,984 --> 00:22:58,821
I believe extreme measures
are warranted.

331
00:23:01,643 --> 00:23:04,269
"The Great Sieges of Westeros."

332
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:05,919
Thrilling subject.

333
00:23:06,582 --> 00:23:10,825
Shame Archmaester Ch'vyalthan
wasn't a better writer.

334
00:23:15,384 --> 00:23:17,356
Stannis knows King's Landing.

335
00:23:18,623 --> 00:23:20,868
He knows where the walls
are strongest

336
00:23:21,118 --> 00:23:24,624
and he knows which gates are weakest.

337
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:28,866
The Mud Gate.

338
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,161
A good ram
will batter it down in minutes

339
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,423
and it's only 50 yards
from the water.

340
00:23:34,673 --> 00:23:36,327
That's where he'll land.

341
00:23:36,577 --> 00:23:40,085
And if Stannis does attack
the Mud Gate, what is our plan?

342
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:45,097
- We could throw books at his men.
- We don't have that many books.

343
00:23:45,347 --> 00:23:46,842
We don't have that many men, either.

344
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,675
What do we have?

345
00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:52,806
Pig shit.

346
00:24:11,674 --> 00:24:13,494
I'm not cut out
for this sort of work.

347
00:24:14,093 --> 00:24:17,248
I always imagined meself
doing something much worse.

348
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:20,208
We're digging latrine pits
at the end of the world.

349
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,460
I can't imagine anything much worse.

350
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:25,267
You lack imagination.

351
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,635
Where do you think Jon is right now?

352
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,638
He went off with the Halfhand.
He didn't come back.

353
00:24:33,108 --> 00:24:34,682
A betting man would go with dead.

354
00:24:36,317 --> 00:24:37,762
He's not dead.

355
00:24:38,012 --> 00:24:39,937
No, Jon's a great fighter.

356
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:43,190
Well, he's better than me
and a lot better than you.

357
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:46,351
He's got a Valyrian steel sword.

358
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:48,779
So did his father.

359
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,490
And Qhorin Halfhand
is the greatest ranger alive.

360
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,385
Great rangers never
get old is the problem.

361
00:24:54,635 --> 00:24:56,167
Shit ones neither.

362
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,654
It's them in the middle
that last a long time.

363
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,476
What in seven hells is that?

364
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:25,716
The First Men made these marks.

365
00:25:25,966 --> 00:25:27,266
Help me with it.

366
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,082
Look.

367
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:48,088
If you find something
you're not supposed to,

368
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:51,961
best thing to do is pretend
you've never seen it.

369
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:53,865
That's a Night's Watch cloak.

370
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,013
It's been here a long time.

371
00:26:03,043 --> 00:26:05,480
- Must be Dragonglass.
- Dragonglass?

372
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,247
The Maesters call it Obsidian.

373
00:26:10,592 --> 00:26:12,029
Why would a brother hide it here?

374
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,318
I expect it's 'cause
he wanted somebody to find it.

375
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:23,610
Mind where you're going.

376
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:33,600
I'm sorry.
I'll...

377
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,015
- Where were you?
- A man has patrol duty.

378
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,881
Tywin Lannister was right here
and now he's gone.

379
00:26:41,131 --> 00:26:42,778
A girl owes one more name.

380
00:26:43,028 --> 00:26:45,062
The Red God demands it.
Give the man a name.

381
00:26:46,908 --> 00:26:49,441
How long after I give you the name
does it take you to kill someone?

382
00:26:50,796 --> 00:26:53,894
A minute, an hour, a month.

383
00:26:55,293 --> 00:26:56,740
Death is certain,

384
00:26:58,139 --> 00:26:59,226
the time is not.

385
00:26:59,476 --> 00:27:01,554
He's taking his army
to attack my brother.

386
00:27:01,804 --> 00:27:03,604
I need him dead right now.

387
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,214
This a man cannot do.

388
00:27:07,703 --> 00:27:09,169
You promised you'd help me.

389
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,297
Help was not promised, lovely girl.
Only death.

390
00:27:13,056 --> 00:27:15,259
There must be others.
Give a name, any name.

391
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:18,145
And you'll kill them?

392
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:20,350
Anybody?

393
00:27:23,924 --> 00:27:26,528
By the seven New Gods
and the Old Gods beyond counting,

394
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:27,854
I swear it.

395
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:32,430
All right.

396
00:27:38,435 --> 00:27:39,625
Jaqen H'ghar.

397
00:27:46,887 --> 00:27:48,584
A girl gives a man his own name?

398
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,253
- That's right.
- Gods are not mocked.

399
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,213
- This is no joking thing.
- I'm not joking.

400
00:27:53,925 --> 00:27:55,424
A man can go kill himself.

401
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,114
- Un-name me.
- No.

402
00:27:57,364 --> 00:27:58,302
Please?

403
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:02,941
I'll un-name you.

404
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:05,934
- Thank you.
- If you help me and my friends escape.

405
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,975
This would require
more than one life.

406
00:28:10,225 --> 00:28:12,983
- This is not part of our bargain.
- Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.

407
00:28:13,887 --> 00:28:14,985
A girl lacks honor.

408
00:28:23,377 --> 00:28:25,961
If I do this thing, a girl must obey.

409
00:28:26,211 --> 00:28:27,467
A girl will obey.

410
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,142
A girl and her friends will walk
through the gate at midnight.

411
00:28:38,207 --> 00:28:39,593
Thank you, Podrick.

412
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,956
Odd little boy.

413
00:28:48,805 --> 00:28:50,771
I have a certain sympathy
for odd little boys.

414
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,232
You and Varys both.

415
00:28:55,381 --> 00:28:56,981
Excellent lamprey pie.

416
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,387
Were you slaving away
in the kitchen all day?

417
00:29:01,286 --> 00:29:02,825
I hear Joffrey plans on fighting.

418
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:05,181
An inspiration for the troops.

419
00:29:05,431 --> 00:29:06,995
The young king in his shining armor

420
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,608
fighting to defend the capital
against the wicked old rebel.

421
00:29:09,858 --> 00:29:11,158
He's only a boy.

422
00:29:11,796 --> 00:29:13,981
Younger boys are off
fighting his war.

423
00:29:15,157 --> 00:29:17,781
- He's not ready.
- What is he, 17?

424
00:29:18,534 --> 00:29:21,009
- Remember Jaime at 17?
- Better than you.

425
00:29:21,531 --> 00:29:24,052
Some men have a gift
for this sort of thing,

426
00:29:24,302 --> 00:29:25,459
some don't.

427
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:27,808
His place is not on the battlefield.

428
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:30,686
It's not on the throne, either,
sadly for all of us.

429
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:37,423
Do you think I'm an idiot?

430
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,820
- No, I'd say you possess above average intelligence.
- You shipped off my only daughter.

431
00:29:42,104 --> 00:29:45,159
And now you want to send my
eldest son to the battlefield to die.

432
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,496
He'll have his Kingsguard
protecting him.

433
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:51,664
He has the finest armor gold can buy.
He needs to be out there.

434
00:29:52,386 --> 00:29:55,294
The men will fight more fiercely
seeing their king fighting beside them

435
00:29:55,997 --> 00:29:58,881
instead of hiding behind
his mother's skirts.

436
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,870
Any dessert?

437
00:30:01,894 --> 00:30:04,411
Do you know why
Varys is so dangerous?

438
00:30:04,661 --> 00:30:07,611
Because he has thousands
of spies in his employ.

439
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:10,645
Because he knows everything
we do before we do it.

440
00:30:10,895 --> 00:30:12,269
Because he doesn't have a cock.

441
00:30:12,988 --> 00:30:13,811
Neither do you.

442
00:30:16,304 --> 00:30:18,154
Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.

443
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:22,946
You, on the other hand,
are as big a fool as every other man.

444
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,705
That little worm between your legs
does half your thinking.

445
00:30:26,955 --> 00:30:28,535
It's not that little.

446
00:30:35,526 --> 00:30:36,793
Why are you smiling?

447
00:30:37,465 --> 00:30:38,865
Because I'm happy.

448
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,509
And why are you happy?

449
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:47,218
Because I have your little whore.

450
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:52,892
I thought you preferred blondes.

451
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,418
Such a droll little fellow.

452
00:30:54,668 --> 00:30:56,313
Tell me, have you
married this one yet?

453
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:58,206
No?

454
00:30:58,856 --> 00:31:01,137
Oh, good.
Father will be so pleased.

455
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,158
Why do you care who I fuck?

456
00:31:03,408 --> 00:31:05,811
Because a Lannister
always pays her debts.

457
00:31:06,061 --> 00:31:07,574
You stole my only daughter,

458
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,284
you plot to have Joffrey killed.

459
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,869
This is madness.

460
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,919
Stannis will be here in days.
You need me.

461
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:15,269
For what?
Your skill in battle?

462
00:31:17,661 --> 00:31:19,795
Pretty thing, your whore.

463
00:31:20,533 --> 00:31:23,715
Lovely body.
The bruises will heal in time.

464
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:27,892
Where did you find her?

465
00:31:28,142 --> 00:31:30,389
Varys isn't the only one
who hears whispers.

466
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:33,132
Really, a Lannister lion necklace?

467
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:36,547
You need to hide your secret whores
more carefully.

468
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,130
You've forgotten the most
important thing about whores.

469
00:31:42,064 --> 00:31:44,099
Well, you're the expert.
Tell me.

470
00:31:45,814 --> 00:31:47,264
You don't buy them;

471
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,689
You only rent them.

472
00:31:50,387 --> 00:31:52,650
You're usually a better liar,
baby brother.

473
00:31:54,142 --> 00:31:55,542
This one you like.

474
00:31:56,783 --> 00:31:58,433
You like her very much.

475
00:31:59,973 --> 00:32:01,086
Could it be love?

476
00:32:02,342 --> 00:32:04,857
Don't worry, she'll be treated
gently enough...

477
00:32:05,107 --> 00:32:06,490
unless Joffrey is hurt.

478
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,355
And then every wound
he suffers she'll suffer, too.

479
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,678
And if he dies,

480
00:32:12,961 --> 00:32:14,713
there isn't a man alive
who could devise

481
00:32:14,963 --> 00:32:17,489
a more painful death
for your little cunt.

482
00:32:20,877 --> 00:32:24,074
And how do I know you
haven't killed her already?

483
00:32:24,324 --> 00:32:25,568
Would you like to see her?

484
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,065
I thought you might.

485
00:32:27,315 --> 00:32:29,868
Ser Mandon, bring in
my brother's whore.

486
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,306
I'm sorry they hurt you.

487
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,050
You must be brave.

488
00:33:13,531 --> 00:33:15,535
I promise I will free you.

489
00:33:17,692 --> 00:33:18,830
Don't forget me.

490
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,601
Never.

491
00:33:39,316 --> 00:33:41,066
I will hurt you for this.

492
00:33:42,052 --> 00:33:45,439
A day will come when you
think you're safe and happy

493
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:49,110
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth.

494
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,154
And you will know the debt is paid.

495
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:54,629
Get out.

496
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,400
I've been waiting all night.

497
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:15,220
What is wrong?

498
00:34:16,283 --> 00:34:17,222
You're beautiful.

499
00:34:25,476 --> 00:34:26,610
Then why do you look sad?

500
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,599
- We have to be more careful.
- Don't be afraid.

501
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:39,244
I can take care of myself.

502
00:34:39,895 --> 00:34:42,396
There are people who want to hurt me.

503
00:34:42,977 --> 00:34:44,832
I know.
I won't let them.

504
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:47,556
I'll cut off their faces.
I will.

505
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:54,801
I would kill for you.
Do you know that?

506
00:34:56,197 --> 00:34:58,472
I expect I'll have to
before this is over.

507
00:35:02,532 --> 00:35:03,810
You're mine.

508
00:35:05,613 --> 00:35:07,147
I'm yours.

509
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,322
Promise me.

510
00:35:13,543 --> 00:35:15,902
I'm yours, and you are mine.

511
00:35:28,048 --> 00:35:29,306
Still no word?

512
00:35:30,263 --> 00:35:32,109
We've sent a dozen ravens.

513
00:35:32,484 --> 00:35:33,934
None have returned.

514
00:35:35,387 --> 00:35:39,090
My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell.
Once he captures the castle--

515
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,530
Theon has my brothers.
If we storm the castle--

516
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,830
He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.

517
00:35:45,678 --> 00:35:48,500
They're his only hope of escaping
the North with his head.

518
00:35:50,856 --> 00:35:52,456
Send word to your son.

519
00:35:54,016 --> 00:35:55,153
Any Ironborn who surrender

520
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,269
will be allowed to return
safely to their homes.

521
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:01,713
A touch of mercy is a virtue,
Your Grace.

522
00:36:01,963 --> 00:36:03,369
- Too much--
- Any ironborn

523
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,997
with the exception of Theon Greyjoy.

524
00:36:07,138 --> 00:36:08,677
He betrayed our cause.

525
00:36:09,632 --> 00:36:10,882
He betrayed me.

526
00:36:12,002 --> 00:36:14,631
And we will hunt him down
no matter where he runs.

527
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,466
His countrymen will turn on him

528
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:17,968
the minute they hear the offer.

529
00:36:21,435 --> 00:36:24,015
Your pardon, My Lord.
Your Grace.

530
00:36:37,637 --> 00:36:38,721
How are you?

531
00:36:40,754 --> 00:36:41,831
How am I?

532
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,244
I've had to arrest my mother.

533
00:36:44,686 --> 00:36:46,550
The Lannisters have my sisters.

534
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,748
The man I considered
my closest friend

535
00:36:49,592 --> 00:36:51,667
has seized my home and my brothers.

536
00:36:51,917 --> 00:36:54,416
I don't know
if I should march South or North.

537
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:57,846
I'm sorry.
It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.

538
00:36:59,602 --> 00:37:00,671
Forgive me.

539
00:37:01,516 --> 00:37:02,803
You're being kind.

540
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:05,542
- I have no right.
- You have every right.

541
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:09,602
- You're a King.
- That's not the King I want to be.

542
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:12,897
- What kind do you want to be?
- I don't know.

543
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,816
The good kind.

544
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:20,343
Most kings grew up as princes.

545
00:37:20,593 --> 00:37:23,739
They spend their whole lives
preparing for the crown.

546
00:37:23,989 --> 00:37:26,217
I was raised to be
Lord of Winterfell.

547
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,331
I was raised
to be a proper little lady,

548
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,244
to play the harp

549
00:37:32,494 --> 00:37:35,958
and dance the latest steps
and recite Valyrian poetry.

550
00:37:36,661 --> 00:37:39,965
- I'd like to hear you play the harp.
- No, you would not.

551
00:37:45,149 --> 00:37:48,914
How did you go
from reciting Valyrian poetry

552
00:37:49,164 --> 00:37:50,782
to sawing off men's feet?

553
00:38:01,462 --> 00:38:02,867
When I was 12,

554
00:38:03,569 --> 00:38:05,929
my mother and father
went to a wedding.

555
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:07,702
Weddings in Volantis last for days.

556
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,557
And they left me
with my little brother.

557
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:17,461
The second afternoon they were gone was
the hottest day in the 3-year summer.

558
00:38:18,274 --> 00:38:21,481
We couldn't bear to be inside,
so we ran down to the Rhoyne.

559
00:38:22,381 --> 00:38:25,290
Every child in Volantis
was in the Rhoyne that day.

560
00:38:27,093 --> 00:38:29,390
The rich, the poor, we were all there,

561
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,560
naked, screaming, racing
to the little islands.

562
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,617
Drummers were playing
for coppers on the East Bank.

563
00:38:39,787 --> 00:38:41,314
I was treading water,

564
00:38:42,615 --> 00:38:43,969
talking to a friend

565
00:38:44,584 --> 00:38:47,121
when I realized
I hadn't seen my brother.

566
00:38:48,642 --> 00:38:50,016
I called his name.

567
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,761
Then I started screaming his name.

568
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,544
And then I saw him

569
00:38:58,655 --> 00:39:00,102
floating facedown.

570
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:05,973
My heart just stopped.
I was...

571
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,711
I dragged him from the water.

572
00:39:14,009 --> 00:39:17,450
My friend helped me, I think.
I don't even remember.

573
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,128
He was so little.

574
00:39:23,942 --> 00:39:26,308
Then we pulled him
onto the riverbank...

575
00:39:28,218 --> 00:39:30,301
and I screamed at him

576
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:31,824
and I shook him

577
00:39:33,091 --> 00:39:34,358
and he was dead.

578
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,730
Just dead.

579
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:43,960
A man ran over.

580
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:48,604
He had a fish tattoo on his face.

581
00:39:50,693 --> 00:39:53,374
In Volantis the slaves have tattoos

582
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:56,185
so you know what they are
without having to talk to them.

583
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,666
And this man
worked on a fishing boat.

584
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:01,375
And he pushed me out of the way.

585
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,817
You have to understand,

586
00:40:04,453 --> 00:40:07,425
for a slave to push a highborn girl...

587
00:40:07,675 --> 00:40:10,549
that's death for the man,
a terrible death.

588
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:14,132
But he pushed me out of the way

589
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,714
and he started pressing
on my brother's chest

590
00:40:19,964 --> 00:40:23,046
again and again and again

591
00:40:24,106 --> 00:40:27,126
until my brother spat out

592
00:40:27,695 --> 00:40:29,008
half of the Rhoyne

593
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:31,097
and cried out.

594
00:40:31,347 --> 00:40:34,268
And the man cradled his head
and told him to be calm.

595
00:40:41,535 --> 00:40:43,654
I decided two things that day.

596
00:40:43,904 --> 00:40:47,153
I would not waste my years
planning dances and masquerades

597
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,293
with the other noble ladies.

598
00:40:50,379 --> 00:40:52,990
And when I came of age...

599
00:40:54,505 --> 00:40:56,917
I would never live
in a slave city again.

600
00:41:04,497 --> 00:41:06,110
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

601
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,024
You told me of your problems
and I've blathered on.

602
00:41:09,274 --> 00:41:10,509
I don't want to marry the Frey girl.

603
00:41:15,845 --> 00:41:17,224
I don't want you to marry her.

604
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:22,944
But you needed that bridge.

605
00:41:25,957 --> 00:41:27,359
I hope it's a beautiful bridge.

606
00:42:34,366 --> 00:42:36,679
The sour cherries
was all crushed up and ready.

607
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,594
- Shut up.
- Probably in the piecrust by now.

608
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,143
In the oven, the nice warm oven.

609
00:42:43,393 --> 00:42:45,647
Shut up.
What did you bring?

610
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,478
The cheese could be better.

611
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,191
Some nice sausages.

612
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:52,188
What did he want us
to do about those guards?

613
00:42:52,438 --> 00:42:54,405
He just said,
"Walk through the gates.

614
00:42:55,561 --> 00:42:57,054
What about the guards?

615
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,789
He didn't say anything.

616
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:02,204
What, he left that bit out?
It's a pretty important part.

617
00:43:02,926 --> 00:43:05,499
- We have to trust him.
- Trust him?

618
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,470
You trusted him to fight with us
and you set him free and he ran.

619
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,880
- I want to go back to the kitchens.
- Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.

620
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,100
Arry, don't.

621
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,346
Away!
Reset!

622
00:43:57,198 --> 00:44:00,429
If the wind holds,
we'll reach King's Landing in a day.

623
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:01,867
Will it hold?

624
00:44:02,117 --> 00:44:04,366
Can't make promises
for the wind, Your Grace.

625
00:44:11,773 --> 00:44:13,273
I admire you, Ser Davos.

626
00:44:13,523 --> 00:44:16,465
I thank you, Your Grace.
Pleased to hear it.

627
00:44:16,715 --> 00:44:20,551
Some highborn fools call you
Onion Knight and think they insult you.

628
00:44:20,801 --> 00:44:22,852
So you take the onion for your sigil,

629
00:44:23,102 --> 00:44:25,410
sew it on your coat,
fly the onion flag.

630
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,539
My son wishes me to change it.

631
00:44:27,789 --> 00:44:30,446
Three mermen with tridents,
something like that.

632
00:44:30,946 --> 00:44:34,140
I understand why the older families
look down at me.

633
00:44:35,086 --> 00:44:36,965
Do you?
Why?

634
00:44:37,215 --> 00:44:39,916
- My father was a crabber.
- And?

635
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:43,763
Well, sons of Lords don't like
to break bread with sons of crabbers.

636
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:48,102
- Our hands stink.
- Where were they when Storm's End starved?

637
00:44:48,695 --> 00:44:51,271
Many fought bravely for your brother.
Many fought for the Mad King.

638
00:44:53,432 --> 00:44:55,109
You defend these men

639
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,060
who insult you behind your back.

640
00:44:57,567 --> 00:44:59,321
Some are happy to do it to my face.

641
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:00,910
We were forgotten.

642
00:45:02,038 --> 00:45:05,828
Robert and Ned Stark... they were
the heroes, the glorious rebels

643
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:08,054
marching from battle to battle,

644
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:10,687
liberating towns
from the yoke of the Mad King

645
00:45:10,937 --> 00:45:13,210
while I held Storm's End
with 500 men.

646
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,379
- No one has forgotten.
- No? Robert did.

647
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:18,868
He gave Storm's End to Renly.
Renly never fought a day in his life.

648
00:45:19,118 --> 00:45:20,467
He was only a boy.

649
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:22,407
Then why'd he give him Storm's End?

650
00:45:25,933 --> 00:45:28,976
First we ate the horses.
We weren't riding anyway,

651
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:31,367
not with the castle surrounded.

652
00:45:31,617 --> 00:45:33,731
We couldn't feed them,
so fine, the horses.

653
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,926
Then the cats. Never liked cats.
So fine.

654
00:45:37,176 --> 00:45:38,385
I do like dogs.

655
00:45:39,061 --> 00:45:42,573
Good animals. Loyal.
But we ate them. Then the rats.

656
00:45:43,621 --> 00:45:46,410
The night before you slipped through,
I thought my wife was dying.

657
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,037
She couldn't speak anymore,
she was so frail.

658
00:45:50,295 --> 00:45:52,399
And then you made it
through the lines.

659
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:54,835
Slipped right through in your little
black sailboat with your onions.

660
00:45:56,101 --> 00:45:58,422
And potatoes.
Some salted beef, I believe.

661
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:01,198
Every man in Storm's End
wanted to kiss you that night.

662
00:46:02,008 --> 00:46:03,778
I was relieved they did not.

663
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:08,736
Robert told me to hold
Storm's End, so I held it.

664
00:46:10,632 --> 00:46:13,520
Then he told me he was giving it
to Renly, so I gave it up.

665
00:46:14,092 --> 00:46:15,725
Insult or no, I gave it up

666
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:20,444
because Robert was my brother, the King,
and I've always done my duty.

667
00:46:20,937 --> 00:46:24,026
But now I'm the rightful king
by every law of Westeros.

668
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:26,867
And when I sit the Iron Throne,
you'll be my Hand.

669
00:46:33,888 --> 00:46:34,958
I serve you well.

670
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,796
I expect you'll be the first
crabber's son to wear the badge.

671
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:48,285
You're the master of whisperers.
You're supposed to know everything.

672
00:46:48,535 --> 00:46:51,320
No man can be in all rooms
at all times.

673
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:54,225
I have many little birds
in the North, My Lord,

674
00:46:54,475 --> 00:46:58,815
but I haven't heard their songs
since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.

675
00:46:59,065 --> 00:47:02,300
The Stark forces are distracted.
Now is the time to strike.

676
00:47:02,836 --> 00:47:03,879
To strike?

677
00:47:05,363 --> 00:47:08,011
My dear nephew, you do see these men
preparing the walls for siege?

678
00:47:08,261 --> 00:47:11,555
You do understand
Stannis Baratheon sails this way?

679
00:47:11,805 --> 00:47:13,915
If my Uncle Stannis
lands on the shores,

680
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,542
- I'll ride out to greet him.
- A brave choice, Your Grace.

681
00:47:18,031 --> 00:47:20,671
I'm sure your men
will line up behind you.

682
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,937
They say Stannis never smiles.

683
00:47:24,226 --> 00:47:27,260
I'll give him a red smile
from ear to ear.

684
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:35,459
Imagine Stannis's terror.

685
00:47:36,468 --> 00:47:37,643
I am trying.

686
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,596
You're an intelligent man.
I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.

687
00:47:42,846 --> 00:47:46,572
Oh, no one disputes that, My Lord,
not even the multitudes who despise you.

688
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,658
I wish we could converse
as two honest, intelligent men.

689
00:47:49,747 --> 00:47:51,202
I wish we could, too.

690
00:47:53,721 --> 00:47:54,580
What do you want?

691
00:47:55,904 --> 00:47:56,927
Tell me.

692
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:00,795
If we're going to play,
you'll have to start.

693
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,589
My brother was the youngest Kingsguard
in history.

694
00:48:10,905 --> 00:48:13,852
My sister became Queen
at the age of 19.

695
00:48:15,999 --> 00:48:19,105
When I reached manhood, my father
put me in charge of all the drains

696
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:21,524
and cisterns in Casterly Rock.

697
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:23,673
A most highborn plumber.

698
00:48:23,923 --> 00:48:25,614
The water never flowed better.

699
00:48:25,864 --> 00:48:28,698
And all the shit
found its way to the sea.

700
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:31,344
I never expected
to have any real power.

701
00:48:31,863 --> 00:48:35,871
- So when my father named me Hand...
- You're good at being Hand, you know?

702
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,384
Jon Arryn and Ned Stark
were good men,

703
00:48:39,089 --> 00:48:40,402
honorable men,

704
00:48:41,132 --> 00:48:43,878
but they disdained the game
and those who played.

705
00:48:44,128 --> 00:48:46,299
- You enjoy the game.
- I do.

706
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,876
Last thing I expected.

707
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:52,032
- And you play it well.
- I'd like to keep playing it.

708
00:48:55,274 --> 00:48:58,108
If Stannis breaches the gates,
the game is over.

709
00:48:58,358 --> 00:49:02,487
They say he burns his enemies alive
to honor the Lord of Light.

710
00:49:03,246 --> 00:49:07,319
The Lord of Light wants enemies burned,
the Drowned God wants them drowned.

711
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:09,613
Why are all the Gods
such vicious cunts?

712
00:49:10,899 --> 00:49:13,189
Where is the God of tits and wine?

713
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:18,164
In the Summer Isles, they worship
a fertility goddess with 16 teats.

714
00:49:18,856 --> 00:49:20,841
We should sail there immediately.

715
00:49:22,957 --> 00:49:24,795
This morning I heard a song

716
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:28,591
all the way from Qarth
beyond the Red Waste.

717
00:49:29,939 --> 00:49:31,385
Daenerys Targaryen lives.

718
00:49:33,258 --> 00:49:36,245
A girl at the edge of the world
is the least of our problems.

719
00:49:36,495 --> 00:49:38,327
She has three dragons.

720
00:49:40,275 --> 00:49:44,647
But even if what they say is true,
it'll be years before they are grown.

721
00:49:45,977 --> 00:49:48,236
And then there will be
nowhere to hide.

722
00:49:49,817 --> 00:49:51,447
One game at a time, my friend.

723
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:03,440
Careful, Khaleesi.

724
00:50:04,158 --> 00:50:08,000
Xaro owns this city and the warlocks
have 1,000 eyes watching for you.

725
00:50:10,031 --> 00:50:11,388
I found one...

726
00:50:12,337 --> 00:50:14,016
a ship with a good captain.

727
00:50:14,602 --> 00:50:16,638
- She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.
- Astapor?

728
00:50:17,909 --> 00:50:18,988
We cannot stay here.

729
00:50:19,238 --> 00:50:21,560
A mother does not flee
without her children.

730
00:50:22,454 --> 00:50:24,313
They're not your children.

731
00:50:25,253 --> 00:50:29,402
They call you the Mother of Dragons,
but you didn't grow them in your womb.

732
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:32,363
They didn't suckle at your breast.
They are dragons, Khaleesi.

733
00:50:32,909 --> 00:50:36,158
- And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.
- You should sail to Astapor.

734
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,054
I'm sure you'll be safe there.

735
00:50:40,926 --> 00:50:42,712
You know I would die for you.

736
00:50:44,123 --> 00:50:45,726
I will never abandon you.

737
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:49,836
- I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.
- Then serve me.

738
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:54,106
If my dragons are in the House
of the Undying, then take me there.

739
00:50:54,356 --> 00:50:56,887
That's what the warlock wants.
He told you so himself.

740
00:50:58,006 --> 00:51:00,678
If you enter that place,
you will never leave again.

741
00:51:00,928 --> 00:51:03,373
- His magic is strong.
- And what of my magic?

742
00:51:04,015 --> 00:51:07,647
You saw me step into the fire.
What did the flames do to me?

743
00:51:07,897 --> 00:51:09,200
Do you remember?

744
00:51:12,284 --> 00:51:15,048
Until my last breath I will remember.

745
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:19,827
After I have forgotten
my mother's face.

746
00:51:24,575 --> 00:51:26,026
They are my children.

747
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,690
And they are the only children
I will ever have.

748
00:51:37,265 --> 00:51:38,517
Take me to them.

749
00:51:51,231 --> 00:51:52,602
We should bury them.

750
00:51:53,686 --> 00:51:56,930
I'd leave 'em up a few more days.
Sends a message.

751
00:51:58,062 --> 00:52:00,326
If they haven't got the message,
a few more days won't help.

752
00:52:01,522 --> 00:52:02,734
As you say.

753
00:52:02,984 --> 00:52:05,657
But it don't hurt
to let 'em rot a while longer.

754
00:52:06,994 --> 00:52:10,352
- What's this?
- Gold for the farmer.

755
00:52:10,602 --> 00:52:14,256
- For his trouble.
- His troubles are done.

756
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,226
He's feeding the crops now.

757
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,553
His wife, too.

758
00:52:21,714 --> 00:52:24,340
You want to keep a man silent,
you silence him.

759
00:52:44,029 --> 00:52:47,237
Got as far as the farm
and then doubled back.

760
00:52:49,589 --> 00:52:52,368
Walked through the stream
to throw off the hounds.

761
00:52:54,733 --> 00:52:57,786
Hoped this would be the last place
they'd think to look.

762
00:53:00,296 --> 00:53:03,044
You're right so far.

763
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:08,535
Who was that out there
hung up the gates?

764
00:53:10,196 --> 00:53:12,272
Must have been the farmer's boys.

765
00:53:14,052 --> 00:53:15,960
He killed them and burned them

766
00:53:17,774 --> 00:53:20,079
and passed them off
as the little lords?

767
00:53:21,923 --> 00:53:23,312
They mustn't know.

768
00:53:25,067 --> 00:53:26,725
Bran would blame himself.

769
00:53:27,535 --> 00:53:29,169
They'll never hear it from me.

770
00:53:30,948 --> 00:53:33,071
The little lads have suffered enough.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
