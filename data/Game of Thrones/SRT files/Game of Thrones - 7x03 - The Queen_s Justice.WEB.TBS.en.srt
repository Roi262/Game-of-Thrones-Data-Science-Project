1
00:00:01,876 --> 00:00:04,208
I wish you all
the happiness in the world.

2
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:09,834
- JAIME LANNISTER: Myrcella?
- (PANTING)

3
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:12,001
Myrcella?

4
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:24,292
(SCREAMS)

5
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,208
Kill us!

6
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,166
I may have found a way
to treat Ser Jorah.

7
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:38,876
Please try not to scream.

8
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,208
(GRUNTING)

9
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,375
MEERA REED:
This is Brandon Stark.

10
00:00:45,042 --> 00:00:46,375
Son of Ned Stark.

11
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:48,208
Let's get them inside.

12
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:50,875
TYRION LANNISTER: For decades,
House Lannister

13
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:52,584
has been
the true power in Westeros,

14
00:00:52,876 --> 00:00:55,624
and the feat of that power
is Casterly Rock.

15
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,041
Grey Worm and the Unsullied
will sail for the Rock,

16
00:00:58,042 --> 00:00:59,083
and take it.

17
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:00,584
Summon Jon Snow.

18
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:02,375
TYRION: He would make
a valuable ally.

19
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:05,082
MELISANDRE: Let him stand before you
and tell you the things

20
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,125
that have happened to him.

21
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:09,375
Dragonstone sits
on a mountain of dragonglass.

22
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:13,208
We can never hope to defeat
the army of the dead alone.

23
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:14,417
We need allies.

24
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:18,249
You're abandoning your people!
You're abandoning your home.

25
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,917
Until I return,
the North is yours.

The bastard

32
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:01,123
The dwarf
of Casterly Rock.

33
00:04:06,373 --> 00:04:08,497
I believe we last saw each other
atop the Wall.

34
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:12,414
You were pissing off the edge
if I remember right.

35
00:04:12,415 --> 00:04:14,872
Picked up some scars
along the road.

36
00:04:14,873 --> 00:04:19,373
It's been a long road,
but we're both still here.

37
00:04:21,373 --> 00:04:22,872
I'm Tyrion Lannister.

38
00:04:22,873 --> 00:04:26,705
- Davos Seaworth.
- Ah, the Onion Knight.

39
00:04:26,706 --> 00:04:29,788
We fought on opposite sides at
the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

40
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:32,372
Unluckily for me.

41
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:35,415
Missandei is the queen's
most trusted advisor.

42
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:38,788
Welcome to Dragonstone.

43
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:40,622
Our queen knows
it is a long journey.

44
00:04:40,623 --> 00:04:43,997
She appreciates the efforts
you have made on her behalf.

45
00:04:43,998 --> 00:04:46,748
If you wouldn't mind
handing over your weapons.

46
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:53,748
Of course.

47
00:05:11,248 --> 00:05:14,040
( men murmuring )

48
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:19,915
Please, this way.

49
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:26,247
Where are you from?

50
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:28,538
I can't place
the accent.

51
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,372
I was born on
the Island of Naath.

52
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:33,456
Ah. I hear it's beautiful
down there.

53
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:35,538
Palm trees
and butterflies.

54
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:36,956
Haven't been, myself.

55
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:42,915
This place has changed.

56
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,414
Tyrion: And Sansa?
I hear she's alive and well.

57
00:05:52,415 --> 00:05:54,915
- Jon: She is.
- Does she miss me terribly?

58
00:05:58,081 --> 00:06:00,497
A sham marriage.
And unconsummated.

59
00:06:00,498 --> 00:06:03,663
- I didn't ask.
- Well, it was. Wasn't.

60
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,580
Anyway...

61
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:08,414
she's much smarter
than she lets on.

62
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:10,788
She's starting
to let on.

63
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:11,706
Good.

64
00:06:11,707 --> 00:06:13,747
Tyrion:
At some point,

65
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,705
I want to hear how a Night's Watch recruit
became King in the North.

66
00:06:17,706 --> 00:06:19,497
As long as you tell me
how a Lannister

67
00:06:19,498 --> 00:06:22,289
became Hand
to Daenerys Targaryen.

68
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,414
A long
and bloody tale.

69
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:27,165
To be honest,
I was drunk for most of it.

70
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,331
My bannermen think
I'm a fool for coming here.

71
00:06:32,332 --> 00:06:33,747
Of course they do.

72
00:06:33,748 --> 00:06:36,457
If I was your Hand,
I would have advised against it.

73
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:40,997
General rule of thumb--

74
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:44,122
Stark men don't fare well
when they travel south.

75
00:06:44,123 --> 00:06:45,872
True...

76
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,997
but I'm not a Stark.

77
00:06:47,998 --> 00:06:51,332
( screeching )

78
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:55,873
( panting )

79
00:07:02,248 --> 00:07:03,498
I'd say you get
used to them...

80
00:07:06,248 --> 00:07:07,706
but you never
really do.

81
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:14,498
Come, their mother
is waiting for you.

82
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:30,456
I wondered why you weren't there
to meet our guests.

83
00:07:30,457 --> 00:07:33,456
You begged us to summon
the King in the North.

84
00:07:33,457 --> 00:07:35,914
Don't you want
to see him again?

85
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:38,538
I've done my part.

86
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:40,955
I've brought
ice and fire together.

87
00:07:40,956 --> 00:07:43,247
Strange.

88
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:45,747
You spoke so highly
of Jon Snow,

89
00:07:45,748 --> 00:07:49,414
but when he arrives,
you hide on a cliff.

90
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:51,788
I didn't take you
for a bashful girl.

91
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:55,997
My time whispering in the ears of kings
has come to an end.

92
00:07:55,998 --> 00:07:58,414
Oh, I doubt that.

93
00:07:58,415 --> 00:08:01,039
Give us common folk
one taste of power,

94
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,872
we're like the lion
who tasted man.

95
00:08:03,873 --> 00:08:07,122
Nothing is ever
so sweet again.

96
00:08:07,123 --> 00:08:10,373
Neither of us
is common folk anymore.

97
00:08:12,498 --> 00:08:14,289
I did not part
on good terms

98
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:17,289
with the King in the North
or his advisor.

99
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,290
Why?

100
00:08:19,956 --> 00:08:21,998
Because of
mistakes I made.

101
00:08:24,123 --> 00:08:25,998
Terrible mistakes.

102
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:30,955
I would only be
a distraction if I stayed.

103
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:33,164
- So, where will you go?
- Volantis.

104
00:08:33,165 --> 00:08:35,164
Good.

105
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:37,414
If you don't mind
my saying,

106
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:41,164
I don't think you should
return to Westeros.

107
00:08:41,165 --> 00:08:43,623
I'm not sure
you'd be safe here.

108
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:48,747
Oh, I will return,
dear Spider.

109
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:50,538
- One last time.
- My lady--

110
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:54,122
I have to die
in this strange country.

111
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:55,956
Just like you.

112
00:09:38,207 --> 00:09:39,830
Missandei:
You stand in the presence

113
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:42,622
of Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen,

114
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,830
rightful heir
to the Iron Throne,

115
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:47,788
rightful Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

116
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:50,206
Protector
of the Seven Kingdoms,

117
00:09:50,207 --> 00:09:51,914
the Mother of Dragons,

118
00:09:51,915 --> 00:09:54,122
the Khaleesi
of the Great Grass Sea,

119
00:09:54,123 --> 00:09:57,915
the Unburnt,
the Breaker of Chains.

120
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,706
This is Jon Snow.

121
00:10:08,706 --> 00:10:10,498
He's King
in the North.

122
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:15,372
Thank you for traveling
so far, my lord.

123
00:10:15,373 --> 00:10:17,622
I hope the seas
weren't too rough.

124
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:19,206
The winds were kind,
Your Grace.

125
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:23,206
Apologies, I have
a Flea Bottom accent, I know,

126
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:26,080
but Jon Snow
is King in the North, Your Grace.

127
00:10:26,081 --> 00:10:27,914
- He's not a lord.
- Forgive me--

128
00:10:27,915 --> 00:10:30,164
Your Grace, this is
Ser Davos Seaworth.

129
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:32,080
Forgive me,
Ser Davos.

130
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:34,705
I never did receive
a formal education,

131
00:10:34,706 --> 00:10:36,039
but I could have
sworn I read

132
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,331
the last King in the North
was Torrhen Stark,

133
00:10:39,332 --> 00:10:42,497
who bent the knee
to my ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.

134
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:45,705
In exchange for his life
and the lives of the Northmen,

135
00:10:45,706 --> 00:10:50,747
Torrhen Stark swore fealty
to House Targaryen in perpetuity.

136
00:10:50,748 --> 00:10:52,247
Or do I have
my facts wrong?

137
00:10:52,248 --> 00:10:54,580
I wasn't there,
Your Grace.

138
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:56,997
No, of course not.

139
00:10:56,998 --> 00:10:59,580
But still,
an oath is an oath.

140
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:01,997
And perpetuity means--

141
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:04,456
what does perpetuity mean,
Lord Tyrion?

142
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:05,955
Forever.

143
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,039
Forever.

144
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,872
- So I assume, my lord...
- ( sighs )

145
00:11:10,873 --> 00:11:13,081
...you're here
to bend the knee.

146
00:11:15,623 --> 00:11:17,165
I am not.

147
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:20,289
Oh.

148
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,123
Well, that is
unfortunate.

149
00:11:23,457 --> 00:11:25,122
You've traveled
all this way

150
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:27,289
to break faith
with House Targaryen?

151
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,788
Break faith?

152
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,122
Your father burned
my grandfather alive.

153
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:33,830
He burned
my uncle alive.

154
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:35,164
He would have burned
the Seven Kingdoms--

155
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:38,248
My father...
was an evil man.

156
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:42,290
On behalf
of House Targaryen...

157
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:45,164
I ask your forgiveness

158
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:48,122
for the crimes he committed
against your family.

159
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:50,997
And I ask you
not to judge a daughter

160
00:11:50,998 --> 00:11:53,373
by the sins
of her father.

161
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:58,331
Our two houses
were allies for centuries,

162
00:11:58,332 --> 00:12:00,206
and those were
the best centuries

163
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:02,331
the Seven Kingdoms
have ever known.

164
00:12:02,332 --> 00:12:04,830
Centuries of peace
and prosperity

165
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:07,663
with a Targaryen
sitting on the Iron Throne

166
00:12:07,664 --> 00:12:11,663
and a Stark serving
as Warden of the North.

167
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:15,414
I am the last Targaryen,
Jon Snow.

168
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:17,830
Honor the pledge
your ancestor made to mine.

169
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:21,497
Bend the knee and I will name you
Warden of the North.

170
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:23,705
Together, we will
save this country

171
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:26,332
from those
who would destroy it.

172
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:38,206
You're right.

173
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:40,705
You're not guilty
of your father's crimes.

174
00:12:40,706 --> 00:12:45,538
And I'm not beholden
to my ancestor's vows.

175
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:47,538
Then why are you here?

176
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:50,373
Because I need your help,
and you need mine.

177
00:12:53,581 --> 00:12:55,538
Did you see
three dragons

178
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:57,497
flying overhead
when you arrived?

179
00:12:57,498 --> 00:12:58,580
I did.

180
00:12:58,581 --> 00:13:00,872
And did you see
the Dothraki,

181
00:13:00,873 --> 00:13:03,080
all of whom have sworn
to kill for me?

182
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:05,039
They're hard to miss.

183
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,080
- But still, I need your help?
- Davos: Not to defeat Cersei.

184
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:12,414
You could storm King's Landing tomorrow
and the city would fall.

185
00:13:12,415 --> 00:13:14,663
Hell, we almost took it
and we didn't even have dragons.

186
00:13:14,664 --> 00:13:18,788
- Almost.
- But you haven't stormed King's Landing.

187
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:20,414
Why not?

188
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:22,122
The only reason
I can see

189
00:13:22,123 --> 00:13:24,372
is you don't want to kill
thousands of innocent people.

190
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:26,414
It's the fastest way
to win the war,

191
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:28,247
but you won't do it,

192
00:13:28,248 --> 00:13:31,456
which means,
at the very least,

193
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:32,915
you're better
than Cersei.

194
00:13:34,415 --> 00:13:37,789
Still, that doesn't explain
why I need your help.

195
00:13:39,664 --> 00:13:44,289
Because right now,
you and I and Cersei and everyone else,

196
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,914
we're children
playing at a game,

197
00:13:45,915 --> 00:13:47,997
screaming that
the rules aren't fair.

198
00:13:47,998 --> 00:13:50,122
- You told me you liked this man.
- I do.

199
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:53,622
In the time since he's met me,
he's refused to call me queen,

200
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:56,497
he's refused to bow,
and now he's calling me a child.

201
00:13:56,498 --> 00:14:00,289
I believe he's calling all of us children.
Figure of speech.

202
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,622
Your Grace, everyone you know will die
before winter's over

203
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:05,788
if we don't defeat
the enemy to the north.

204
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:08,456
As far as I can see,
you  are the enemy to the north.

205
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:10,123
I am not your enemy.

206
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:13,456
The dead
are the enemy.

207
00:14:13,457 --> 00:14:14,998
The dead?

208
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,872
Is that another
figure of speech?

209
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:19,497
The Army of the Dead
is on the march.

210
00:14:19,498 --> 00:14:21,580
The Army of the Dead?

211
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:23,747
You don't
know me well, my lord,

212
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:27,080
but do you think
I'm a liar or a madman?

213
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:29,622
No, I don't think
you're either of those things.

214
00:14:29,623 --> 00:14:31,747
The Army of the Dead
is real.

215
00:14:31,748 --> 00:14:33,206
The white walkers
are real.

216
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:36,122
The Night King is real.
I've seen them.

217
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:37,663
If they get
past the Wall

218
00:14:37,664 --> 00:14:40,165
and we're squabbling
amongst ourselves...

219
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:44,789
we're finished.

220
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:52,664
I was born
at Dragonstone.

221
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,997
Not that I can
remember it.

222
00:14:56,998 --> 00:15:00,456
We fled before
Robert's assassins could find us.

223
00:15:00,457 --> 00:15:03,663
Robert was your father's
best friend, no?

224
00:15:03,664 --> 00:15:07,497
I wonder if your father knew
his best friend sent assassins

225
00:15:07,498 --> 00:15:10,040
to murder a baby girl
in her crib.

226
00:15:11,498 --> 00:15:13,415
Not that it matters now,
of course.

227
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:18,497
I spent my life
in foreign lands.

228
00:15:18,498 --> 00:15:20,872
So many men
have tried to kill me,

229
00:15:20,873 --> 00:15:24,372
I don't remember
all their names.

230
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:28,456
I have been sold
like a broodmare.

231
00:15:28,457 --> 00:15:31,997
I've been chained
and betrayed,

232
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:34,788
raped and defiled.

233
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:37,039
Do you know
what kept me standing

234
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,997
through all those years
in exile?

235
00:15:39,998 --> 00:15:42,955
Faith.

236
00:15:42,956 --> 00:15:45,206
Not in any gods,

237
00:15:45,207 --> 00:15:48,747
not in myths
and legends.

238
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:51,372
In myself.

239
00:15:51,373 --> 00:15:54,538
In Daenerys Targaryen.

240
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:58,080
The world hadn't seen
a dragon in centuries

241
00:15:58,081 --> 00:16:00,456
until my children
were born.

242
00:16:00,457 --> 00:16:05,247
The Dothraki hadn't
crossed the sea, any sea.

243
00:16:05,248 --> 00:16:07,622
They did for me.

244
00:16:07,623 --> 00:16:12,080
I was born to rule
the Seven Kingdoms,

245
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:14,207
and I will.

246
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:19,080
You'll be ruling
over a graveyard

247
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:21,415
if we don't defeat
the Night King.

248
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:26,039
The war against my sister
has already begun.

249
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,414
You can't expect us
to halt hostilities

250
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,247
and join you
in fighting

251
00:16:30,248 --> 00:16:31,748
whatever you saw
beyond the Wall.

252
00:16:34,623 --> 00:16:36,164
You don't believe him.

253
00:16:36,165 --> 00:16:39,080
I understand that.
It sounds like nonsense.

254
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,872
But if destiny has brought
Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores,

255
00:16:42,873 --> 00:16:46,080
it has also made Jon Snow
King in the North.

256
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:49,206
You were the first
to bring Dothraki to Westeros?

257
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:52,580
He is the first to make allies of
wildlings and Northmen.

258
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:54,663
He was named Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

259
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:55,747
He was named
King in the North.

260
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,122
Not because
of his birthright.

261
00:16:57,123 --> 00:16:59,497
He has no birthright.
He's a damn bastard.

262
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:04,538
All those hard sons of bitches
chose him as their leader

263
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:06,248
because they
believe in him.

264
00:17:07,664 --> 00:17:09,622
All those things
you don't believe in,

265
00:17:09,623 --> 00:17:11,164
he faced
those things.

266
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:13,372
He fought those things
for the good of his people.

267
00:17:13,373 --> 00:17:14,955
He risked his life
for his people.

268
00:17:14,956 --> 00:17:16,747
He took a knife in the heart
for his people.

269
00:17:16,748 --> 00:17:18,498
He gave his own--

270
00:17:24,664 --> 00:17:27,414
If we don't put aside our enmities
and band together,

271
00:17:27,415 --> 00:17:29,497
we will die.

272
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:33,164
And then it doesn't matter
whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.

273
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:35,497
If it doesn't matter,
then you might as well kneel.

274
00:17:35,498 --> 00:17:37,663
Swear your allegiance
to Queen Daenerys,

275
00:17:37,664 --> 00:17:39,289
help her to defeat
my sister,

276
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,456
and together, our armies
will protect the North.

277
00:17:41,457 --> 00:17:43,206
There's no time
for that.

278
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:45,122
There's no time
for any of this!

279
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:46,622
While we stand here,
debating--

280
00:17:46,623 --> 00:17:48,580
It takes no time
to bend the knee.

281
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:50,414
Pledge your sword
to her cause.

282
00:17:50,415 --> 00:17:52,165
And why
would I do that?

283
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,164
I mean no offense,
Your Grace,

284
00:17:57,165 --> 00:17:58,372
but I don't know you.

285
00:17:58,373 --> 00:18:00,206
As far as I can tell,

286
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:03,497
your claim to the throne rests
entirely on your father's name,

287
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:06,831
and my own father fought
to overthrow the Mad King.

288
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:10,622
The lords of the North

289
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:13,456
placed their trust
in me to lead them,

290
00:18:13,457 --> 00:18:17,498
and I will continue to do so
as well as I can.

291
00:18:18,748 --> 00:18:20,207
That's fair.

292
00:18:21,706 --> 00:18:23,580
It's also fair
to point out

293
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:27,705
that I'm the rightful
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

294
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:31,456
By declaring yourself king
of the northernmost kingdom,

295
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:33,372
you are in
open rebellion.

296
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:35,332
( footsteps approaching )

297
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:45,663
( whispering ) Your Grace, please
dismiss your guests.

298
00:18:45,664 --> 00:18:47,748
I have grave news.

299
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,164
You must forgive
my manners.

300
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,538
You'll both be tired
after your long journey.

301
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:57,290
We'll have baths drawn for you
and supper sent to your rooms.

302
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:04,123
( speaking Dothraki )

303
00:19:06,748 --> 00:19:08,081
Am I your prisoner?

304
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:13,373
Not yet.

305
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:32,497
Our ironborn
and Dornish allies

306
00:19:32,498 --> 00:19:33,955
were attacked
en route to Dorne.

307
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:36,456
- And?
- Two or three ships escaped,

308
00:19:36,457 --> 00:19:38,788
the rest,
sunk or captured.

309
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:41,372
Ellaria and the Sand Snakes,
dead or captured.

310
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:43,955
The Greyjoys,
dead or captured.

311
00:19:43,956 --> 00:19:45,664
All of them?

312
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,914
( men shouting )

313
00:19:48,915 --> 00:19:50,788
- Pull!
- Heave!

314
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,164
Pull!

315
00:19:52,165 --> 00:19:54,663
( men grunt )

316
00:19:54,664 --> 00:19:56,290
( grunts )

317
00:20:02,415 --> 00:20:03,873
Your sister's dead?

318
00:20:05,373 --> 00:20:07,414
Euron has her.

319
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,789
You saw him take her?

320
00:20:11,081 --> 00:20:14,456
- But you got away?
- I couldn't save her.

321
00:20:14,457 --> 00:20:15,956
I tried.

322
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:19,332
You wouldn't be here
if you tried.

323
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,705
Man:
Come, men!

324
00:20:25,706 --> 00:20:27,040
Sails up!

325
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:33,457
( crowd cheering )

326
00:20:35,664 --> 00:20:37,664
Woman:
Murderer!

327
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,538
Man:
Whores!

328
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:52,873
- ( all shouting )
- Traitor!

329
00:20:56,706 --> 00:20:57,998
This is the life.

330
00:20:59,207 --> 00:21:02,872
Look at them,
cheering for a Greyjoy.

331
00:21:02,873 --> 00:21:04,372
( cheering )

332
00:21:04,373 --> 00:21:07,206
- ( grunts )
- ( laughter )

333
00:21:07,207 --> 00:21:08,788
I have to be honest,

334
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,748
this is making me hard.

335
00:21:13,748 --> 00:21:15,456
Did you see
Little Theon's face

336
00:21:15,457 --> 00:21:17,830
right before
he jumped overboard?

337
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:20,372
"Oh, no!"
( laughs )

338
00:21:20,373 --> 00:21:21,831
What a twat.

339
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:25,539
( crowd booing )

340
00:21:27,623 --> 00:21:30,040
- ( crowd shouting )
- ( spits )

341
00:21:49,581 --> 00:21:52,539
- Man: Whore! Whore! Whore!
- Man #2: Murderers!

342
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,457
( applause )

343
00:22:24,498 --> 00:22:25,830
( grunts )

344
00:22:25,831 --> 00:22:29,164
My queen,
please accept this gift

345
00:22:29,165 --> 00:22:32,998
on behalf of all of your loyal subjects
in the Iron Islands.

346
00:22:34,123 --> 00:22:35,123
( both grunt, gasp )

347
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:42,164
I give you
what no other man could give--

348
00:22:42,165 --> 00:22:44,289
justice.

349
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:47,956
Justice for your
murdered daughter.

350
00:22:57,498 --> 00:23:01,497
You've proven yourself
the greatest captain on the fourteen seas

351
00:23:01,498 --> 00:23:04,164
and a true friend
to the crown.

352
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:07,372
You deserve more
than a true friend.

353
00:23:07,373 --> 00:23:10,872
And you deserve
a proper reward for your heroism.

354
00:23:10,873 --> 00:23:13,539
There's only
one reward I want.

355
00:23:14,831 --> 00:23:17,539
You shall have
what your heart desires...

356
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:21,123
when the war is won.

357
00:23:27,498 --> 00:23:30,955
With Euron Greyjoy
commanding our naval forces

358
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:34,122
and Jaime Lannister
leading our armies,

359
00:23:34,123 --> 00:23:36,164
the sons and daughters
of Westeros

360
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,456
shall defend our country.

361
00:23:38,457 --> 00:23:39,915
( crowd cheering )

362
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:47,705
There's nothing
quite like it, is there?

363
00:23:47,706 --> 00:23:49,456
The love of the people.

364
00:23:49,457 --> 00:23:51,580
Though I suppose
you wouldn't know.

365
00:23:51,581 --> 00:23:54,914
This same mob
spat at my sister not long ago.

366
00:23:54,915 --> 00:23:56,663
And if you turn
on us,

367
00:23:56,664 --> 00:23:59,872
they'll cheer to see your head
mounted on a spike.

368
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:01,372
Or yours.

369
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:04,497
They just like
severed heads, really.

370
00:24:04,498 --> 00:24:07,747
Listen, if you have
any advice at all,

371
00:24:07,748 --> 00:24:09,331
I would love to hear it.

372
00:24:09,332 --> 00:24:12,372
When we have an hour or two
to speak as brothers.

373
00:24:12,373 --> 00:24:14,080
Advice?

374
00:24:14,081 --> 00:24:17,747
Does she like it
gentle or rough?

375
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,414
A finger in the bum?

376
00:24:19,415 --> 00:24:22,706
Shh, shh, shh, shh, not now.
We'll talk later.

377
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:43,497
Cersei: I want you to know
I understand.

378
00:24:43,498 --> 00:24:45,080
Even though
we're enemies, you and I,

379
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:46,748
I understand the fury
that drives you.

380
00:24:47,915 --> 00:24:49,247
I was there that day

381
00:24:49,248 --> 00:24:51,040
when Ser Gregor crushed
your lover's head.

382
00:24:53,581 --> 00:24:55,914
If I close my eyes,

383
00:24:55,915 --> 00:24:58,205
I can hear the sound
of Oberyn's skull breaking.

384
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:58,911
( grunts )

385
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:01,122
The sound
of your scream.

386
00:25:01,123 --> 00:25:02,622
I never heard
a sound like that.

387
00:25:02,623 --> 00:25:04,581
I thought,
"That's true love."

388
00:25:06,165 --> 00:25:08,456
Oberyn looked beautiful that day.
He really did.

389
00:25:08,457 --> 00:25:09,830
No one moved like him.

390
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:12,955
No one had such skill
with a spear.

391
00:25:12,956 --> 00:25:16,039
Even Ser Gregor
couldn't stop him.

392
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,497
If only he hadn't
taunted him.

393
00:25:18,498 --> 00:25:22,456
He could've walked away
and left poor Ser Gregor to die.

394
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:24,497
But that wasn't
your lover's way, was it?

395
00:25:24,498 --> 00:25:27,331
Now he's buried
somewhere.

396
00:25:27,332 --> 00:25:30,080
And here's Ser Gregor,
stronger than ever.

397
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:31,998
That must be
difficult for you.

398
00:25:35,956 --> 00:25:37,955
When my daughter
was taken from me,

399
00:25:37,956 --> 00:25:41,080
my only daughter...

400
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,872
well, you can't
imagine how that feels

401
00:25:43,873 --> 00:25:46,122
unless you've
lost a child.

402
00:25:46,123 --> 00:25:48,788
I fed her at my own breast
even though they told me

403
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:51,497
to give her
to the wet nurse.

404
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:54,997
I couldn't bear to see her
in another woman's arms.

405
00:25:54,998 --> 00:25:57,247
I never got
to have a mother,

406
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,663
but Myrcella did.

407
00:25:58,664 --> 00:26:02,331
She was mine,
and you took her from me.

408
00:26:02,332 --> 00:26:04,373
Why did you do that?

409
00:26:10,956 --> 00:26:12,332
Doesn't matter now.

410
00:26:20,915 --> 00:26:23,663
Your daughter's
a beauty, too.

411
00:26:23,664 --> 00:26:26,289
Those brown eyes.

412
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,998
Those lips.

413
00:26:29,623 --> 00:26:31,663
Perfect Dornish beauty.

414
00:26:31,664 --> 00:26:33,538
I imagine
she's your favorite.

415
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,705
I know, I know,
we're not supposed to have favorites,

416
00:26:36,706 --> 00:26:38,873
but still,
we're only human.

417
00:26:40,373 --> 00:26:41,955
We love whom we love.

418
00:26:41,956 --> 00:26:43,539
( muffled speech )

419
00:26:44,831 --> 00:26:46,830
I'm sorry,
I can't understand you.

420
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:50,206
That gag makes it impossible
to understand what you're saying.

421
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:52,040
It must be frustrating.

422
00:26:55,207 --> 00:26:58,206
We all make
our choices.

423
00:26:58,207 --> 00:27:00,622
You chose to murder
my daughter.

424
00:27:00,623 --> 00:27:02,872
You must have felt powerful
after you made that choice.

425
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:05,081
- ( grunts )
- Do you feel powerful now?

426
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:13,039
I don't sleep very well.

427
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,414
Not at all, really.

428
00:27:15,415 --> 00:27:17,331
I lie in bed
and I stare at the canopy

429
00:27:17,332 --> 00:27:19,705
and imagine ways
of killing my enemies.

430
00:27:19,706 --> 00:27:23,581
How to destroy Ellaria Sand,
the woman who murdered my only daughter.

431
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:26,747
I thought about
having Ser Gregor

432
00:27:26,748 --> 00:27:28,914
crush your skull
the way he did Oberyn's.

433
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:33,622
It would be poetic, I suppose,
but fast, too fast.

434
00:27:33,623 --> 00:27:36,581
I thought about having him
crush your daughter's skull.

435
00:27:37,664 --> 00:27:39,415
She's so beautiful.

436
00:27:40,664 --> 00:27:42,331
The thought
of this lovely face

437
00:27:42,332 --> 00:27:44,747
cracking open
like a duck egg,

438
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:46,498
no, it's just not right.

439
00:27:47,956 --> 00:27:50,123
- ( Tyene whimpers )
- ( gasps )

440
00:27:53,956 --> 00:27:55,080
Mama.

441
00:27:55,081 --> 00:27:56,830
( grunts )

442
00:27:56,831 --> 00:27:58,789
( crying )

443
00:28:05,457 --> 00:28:07,788
Qyburn here is
the cleverest man I know.

444
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:10,872
Clever enough to learn
what poison you used to murder Myrcella.

445
00:28:10,873 --> 00:28:12,538
The Long Goodbye,
was that it?

446
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:14,623
- The Long Farewell.
- That's the one.

447
00:28:18,956 --> 00:28:20,456
How long does
the poison take?

448
00:28:20,457 --> 00:28:23,122
Qyburn: Difficult to say--
hours, days.

449
00:28:23,123 --> 00:28:24,997
It depends
on the subject's constitution.

450
00:28:24,998 --> 00:28:28,498
- But death is certain?
- Oh, yes, Your Grace, quite certain.

451
00:28:33,873 --> 00:28:36,747
Your daughter will die
here in this cell,

452
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,872
and you will be here
watching when she does.

453
00:28:39,873 --> 00:28:42,664
You'll be here
the rest of your days.

454
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:48,497
If you refuse to eat,
we'll force food down your throat.

455
00:28:48,498 --> 00:28:52,206
You will live to watch
your daughter rot.

456
00:28:52,207 --> 00:28:55,497
- To watch that beautiful face collapse...
- ( sobbing )

457
00:28:55,498 --> 00:28:57,623
...to bone and dust.

458
00:28:59,998 --> 00:29:02,956
All the while contemplating
the choices you've made.

459
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,663
Make sure the guards
change the torches every few hours.

460
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,081
I don't want her
to miss a thing.

461
00:29:14,873 --> 00:29:17,581
( both crying )

462
00:29:41,081 --> 00:29:42,332
No.

463
00:30:06,123 --> 00:30:08,123
( panting )

464
00:30:10,915 --> 00:30:13,748
( birds chirping )

465
00:30:20,248 --> 00:30:21,457
( knocking on door )

466
00:30:24,581 --> 00:30:25,581
Don't.

467
00:30:37,623 --> 00:30:40,456
What are you doing?
No one can see us like this.

468
00:30:40,457 --> 00:30:44,123
I am the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
I'll do as I please.

469
00:30:49,664 --> 00:30:50,788
Forgive me, Your Grace.

470
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:53,122
The visitor from Braavos
has arrived.

471
00:30:53,123 --> 00:30:56,122
Good. And we'll need
fresh sheets for the bed.

472
00:30:56,123 --> 00:30:57,457
At once, Your Grace.

473
00:31:00,373 --> 00:31:01,830
( chuckles )

474
00:31:01,831 --> 00:31:02,831
( liquid pouring )

475
00:31:08,332 --> 00:31:10,705
No, thank you.

476
00:31:10,706 --> 00:31:12,414
My condolences,
Your Grace,

477
00:31:12,415 --> 00:31:14,372
on the death
of your son.

478
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:17,080
From all reports,
he was a fine young man.

479
00:31:17,081 --> 00:31:19,830
The Iron Bank didn't send you here
to offer condolences.

480
00:31:19,831 --> 00:31:23,331
Condolences
and congratulations.

481
00:31:23,332 --> 00:31:26,289
To become the first ruling Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms,

482
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,289
that's quite
an accomplishment.

483
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:32,080
The Iron Bank appreciates
how you cast off the yoke of superstition,

484
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:33,663
freeing the crown
from elements

485
00:31:33,664 --> 00:31:36,164
who sought to subvert
the rule of law.

486
00:31:36,165 --> 00:31:39,331
The destruction of the Sept of Baelor
was a tragic accident.

487
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:43,538
Indeed, but sometimes
tragedies are necessary

488
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:45,914
to restore order
and rational leadership.

489
00:31:45,915 --> 00:31:48,663
The Iron Bank
wants its gold back.

490
00:31:48,664 --> 00:31:51,247
Your father never
minced words either.

491
00:31:51,248 --> 00:31:55,080
But, yes, your debts
are considerable.

492
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:57,955
And you're now engaged in a conflict
on several fronts.

493
00:31:57,956 --> 00:32:00,872
We both know
how expensive war can be.

494
00:32:00,873 --> 00:32:03,080
And we both know
gold wins wars.

495
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:04,538
Your vaults are empty.

496
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:07,039
Your late husband's
profligacy saw to that.

497
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,372
Your wealthiest allies,
the Tyrells, are now your enemies.

498
00:32:10,373 --> 00:32:13,955
You are surrounded
on all sides by rivals for the throne.

499
00:32:13,956 --> 00:32:15,914
And the Iron Bank
wants to bet on a winner.

500
00:32:15,915 --> 00:32:17,622
We don't make bets.

501
00:32:17,623 --> 00:32:21,206
We invest in endeavors
we deem likely to be successful.

502
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:24,164
A fancy way
of saying "bet."

503
00:32:24,165 --> 00:32:27,914
The war's already begun.
I've drawn first blood.

504
00:32:27,915 --> 00:32:30,914
I decapitated
the Dornish snake.

505
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,955
My armada owns
the Narrow Sea.

506
00:32:32,956 --> 00:32:35,414
Euron Greyjoy's armada
owns the Narrow Sea.

507
00:32:35,415 --> 00:32:36,914
Euron Greyjoy
is loyal to me.

508
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:39,122
For now.

509
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,872
Daenerys Targaryen has
three full-grown dragons.

510
00:32:42,873 --> 00:32:47,206
How well do wooden ships fare against
fire-breathing dragons?

511
00:32:47,207 --> 00:32:52,247
Her dragons might not be
as invulnerable as some think.

512
00:32:52,248 --> 00:32:54,622
But let's talk about
the Targaryen girl.

513
00:32:54,623 --> 00:32:56,538
You want to
invest in her?

514
00:32:56,539 --> 00:33:00,914
I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested
considerable gold in the slave trade.

515
00:33:00,915 --> 00:33:03,164
How are your profits

516
00:33:03,165 --> 00:33:05,705
now that Daenerys
has freed all the slaves?

517
00:33:05,706 --> 00:33:09,872
The slave trade has
entered a downturn, it's true.

518
00:33:09,873 --> 00:33:11,747
From what I gather,
she considers herself

519
00:33:11,748 --> 00:33:15,080
more of a revolutionary
than a monarch.

520
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:18,997
In your experience, how do bankers
usually fare with revolutionaries?

521
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:21,997
The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank
quite a lot of money,

522
00:33:21,998 --> 00:33:24,164
but Lannisters
always pay their debts.

523
00:33:24,165 --> 00:33:28,581
Do former slaves
or Dothraki or dragons?

524
00:33:32,165 --> 00:33:34,164
Your father's daughter,
indeed.

525
00:33:34,165 --> 00:33:35,497
Give me a fortnight.

526
00:33:35,498 --> 00:33:37,705
Stay in King's Landing
as my honored guest.

527
00:33:37,706 --> 00:33:39,122
And when you
return to Braavos,

528
00:33:39,123 --> 00:33:43,581
I swear to you, my debt
will be paid in full.

529
00:34:07,207 --> 00:34:11,040
I came down here to brood over
my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.

530
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:15,122
You're making it
difficult.

531
00:34:15,123 --> 00:34:18,789
You look a lot better
brooding than I do.

532
00:34:20,498 --> 00:34:23,039
You make me feel like
I'm failing at brooding over failing.

533
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,747
I'm a prisoner
on this island.

534
00:34:24,748 --> 00:34:28,705
I wouldn't say you're
a prisoner on this island.

535
00:34:28,706 --> 00:34:30,206
You're free
to walk the castle,

536
00:34:30,207 --> 00:34:32,122
the beaches,
to go wherever you want.

537
00:34:32,123 --> 00:34:34,289
Except to my ship.

538
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,705
You took my ship.

539
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,663
I wouldn't say
we took your ship.

540
00:34:37,664 --> 00:34:40,164
I'm not playing
word games with you.

541
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:42,039
The dead are coming
for us all.

542
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,705
Why don't you
figure out what to do

543
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,788
about my missing fleet
and murdered allies,

544
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:48,663
and I'll figure out what to do
about your walking dead men.

545
00:34:48,664 --> 00:34:50,872
It's hard for me to fathom.
It really is.

546
00:34:50,873 --> 00:34:53,998
If someone told me about the white walkers
and the Night King...

547
00:35:01,415 --> 00:35:02,664
You probably
don't believe me.

548
00:35:05,123 --> 00:35:07,289
I do, actually.

549
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,831
You didn't before.

550
00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:12,747
"Grumkins and snarks,"
you called them.

551
00:35:12,748 --> 00:35:14,830
Do you remember?

552
00:35:14,831 --> 00:35:16,914
You said
it was all nonsense.

553
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:20,039
It was nonsense.
Everybody knew it.

554
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,164
But then Mormont
saw them

555
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:24,580
and you saw them.

556
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,247
And I trust the eyes
of an honest man

557
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:28,248
more than I trust
what everybody knows.

558
00:35:29,581 --> 00:35:31,830
How do I convince people
who don't know me

559
00:35:31,831 --> 00:35:34,580
that an enemy they don't believe in
is coming to kill them all?

560
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:37,914
- Good question.
- I know it's a good question.

561
00:35:37,915 --> 00:35:40,080
I'm looking
for an answer.

562
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:44,372
People's minds aren't made for
problems that large.

563
00:35:44,373 --> 00:35:46,830
White walkers,
the Night King,

564
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:48,914
Army of the Dead--

565
00:35:48,915 --> 00:35:50,538
it's almost a relief
to confront

566
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:53,415
a comfortable,
familiar monster like my sister.

567
00:35:55,748 --> 00:35:58,706
I need to help prepare my people
for what's coming.

568
00:36:00,415 --> 00:36:02,748
I can't help them
from here.

569
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:05,498
I'd like to leave.

570
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,456
It seems unlikely that
you became King in the North

571
00:36:09,457 --> 00:36:11,123
by giving up
that easily.

572
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:16,414
Everyone told me to learn
from my father's mistakes.

573
00:36:16,415 --> 00:36:18,206
Don't go south.

574
00:36:18,207 --> 00:36:20,872
Don't answer a summons
from the Mad King's daughter,

575
00:36:20,873 --> 00:36:22,290
a foreign invader.

576
00:36:24,664 --> 00:36:27,372
And here I am,

577
00:36:27,373 --> 00:36:28,914
a Northern fool.

578
00:36:28,915 --> 00:36:31,372
Children are not
their fathers,

579
00:36:31,373 --> 00:36:33,081
luckily
for all of us.

580
00:36:34,581 --> 00:36:36,788
And sometimes there's more
to foreign invaders

581
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:38,997
and Northern fools
than meets the eye.

582
00:36:38,998 --> 00:36:43,206
Daenerys could have sailed
for Westeros long ago, but she didn't.

583
00:36:43,207 --> 00:36:45,039
Instead, she stayed
where she was

584
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,705
and saved many people
from horrible fates,

585
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,039
some of whom are on this island
with us right now.

586
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,622
While you're
our guest here,

587
00:36:51,623 --> 00:36:53,164
you might consider
asking them

588
00:36:53,165 --> 00:36:55,914
what they think
of the Mad King's daughter.

589
00:36:55,915 --> 00:36:58,997
She protects people
from monsters,

590
00:36:58,998 --> 00:37:00,538
just as you do.

591
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:02,997
It's why she came here.

592
00:37:02,998 --> 00:37:04,538
And she's not about
to head north

593
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:05,997
to fight an enemy
she's never seen

594
00:37:05,998 --> 00:37:08,497
on the word of a man
she doesn't know.

595
00:37:08,498 --> 00:37:10,914
After a single meeting,

596
00:37:10,915 --> 00:37:13,706
it's not a reasonable
thing to ask.

597
00:37:20,081 --> 00:37:22,332
So, do you have anything
reasonable to ask?

598
00:37:27,165 --> 00:37:28,331
What do you mean?

599
00:37:28,332 --> 00:37:30,580
Maybe you are
a Northern fool.

600
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:34,248
I'm asking if there's something
I can do to help you.

601
00:37:37,207 --> 00:37:38,747
- Dragonglass?
- Tyrion: Yes.

602
00:37:38,748 --> 00:37:41,206
Volcanic glass,
obsidian.

603
00:37:41,207 --> 00:37:43,206
He says you have
a tremendous amount of it here.

604
00:37:43,207 --> 00:37:44,997
Why are we talking
about glass?

605
00:37:44,998 --> 00:37:46,872
We just lost
two of our allies.

606
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:50,248
Which is why I was
speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.

607
00:37:52,623 --> 00:37:56,372
And what does the King in the North
want with dragonglass?

608
00:37:56,373 --> 00:37:58,705
Apparently, it can be
turned into weapons

609
00:37:58,706 --> 00:38:01,830
that kill white walkers
and their foot soldiers.

610
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:03,997
Or stop them.

611
00:38:03,998 --> 00:38:05,289
Destroy them.

612
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,915
Unsure about
the nomenclature.

613
00:38:08,873 --> 00:38:11,830
And what do you think
about this Army of the Dead

614
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,705
and white walkers
and Night Kings?

615
00:38:14,706 --> 00:38:17,331
I'd very much like to believe
that Jon Snow is wrong.

616
00:38:17,332 --> 00:38:20,580
But a wise man once said
that you should never believe a thing

617
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:23,123
simply because
you want to believe it.

618
00:38:25,831 --> 00:38:28,997
Which wise man
said this?

619
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:30,872
I don't remember.

620
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:34,290
Are you trying to present
your own statements as ancient wisdom?

621
00:38:35,498 --> 00:38:37,705
I would never do that.

622
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:38,748
To you.

623
00:38:40,581 --> 00:38:44,247
The reason I believe Jon Snow
is because he's here.

624
00:38:44,248 --> 00:38:46,663
All of his advisors
would have told him not to come.

625
00:38:46,664 --> 00:38:48,747
I would have told him
not to come.

626
00:38:48,748 --> 00:38:51,080
And he's here anyway.

627
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:53,497
You don't
have to believe him.

628
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,538
Let him mine
the dragonglass.

629
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:57,164
If he's wrong,
it's worthless.

630
00:38:57,165 --> 00:38:59,247
You didn't even know
it was here.

631
00:38:59,248 --> 00:39:01,788
It's nothing to you.

632
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:05,080
Give him something
by giving him nothing.

633
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:07,788
Take a step toward
a more productive relationship

634
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:10,372
with a possible ally.

635
00:39:10,373 --> 00:39:13,747
Keep him occupied
while we focus on the task at hand--

636
00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:15,123
Casterly Rock.

637
00:39:16,373 --> 00:39:18,164
What was that
Ser Davos said

638
00:39:18,165 --> 00:39:22,206
about taking a knife in the heart
for his people?

639
00:39:22,207 --> 00:39:23,997
Did you notice that?

640
00:39:23,998 --> 00:39:26,456
You must allow them
their flights of fancy.

641
00:39:26,457 --> 00:39:28,623
It's dreary
in the North.

642
00:39:31,207 --> 00:39:34,123
( screeching )

643
00:39:44,498 --> 00:39:45,998
Amazing thing
to see.

644
00:39:47,498 --> 00:39:50,539
I named them for my brothers,
Viserys and Rhaegar.

645
00:39:51,664 --> 00:39:53,165
They're both gone now.

646
00:39:55,457 --> 00:39:56,831
You lost
two brothers as well.

647
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:02,873
People thought dragons
were gone forever, but here they are.

648
00:40:04,623 --> 00:40:07,457
Perhaps we should all be examining
what we think we know.

649
00:40:13,415 --> 00:40:15,705
You've been talking
to Tyrion.

650
00:40:15,706 --> 00:40:18,456
He is my Hand.

651
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:21,081
- He enjoys talking.
- We all enjoy what we're good at.

652
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:24,040
I don't.

653
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,039
You know I'm not going to let Cersei
stay on the Iron Throne.

654
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,206
I never expected
that you would.

655
00:40:33,207 --> 00:40:34,456
And I haven't
changed my mind

656
00:40:34,457 --> 00:40:36,538
about which kingdoms
belong to that throne.

657
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:38,373
I haven't either.

658
00:40:42,915 --> 00:40:43,915
( sighs )

659
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:51,914
I will allow you to mine the dragonglass
and forge weapons from it.

660
00:40:51,915 --> 00:40:54,915
Any resources or men you need,
I will provide for you.

661
00:40:58,415 --> 00:40:59,415
Thank you.

662
00:41:05,915 --> 00:41:09,581
So you believe me, then, about the
Night King and the Army of the Dead?

663
00:41:12,748 --> 00:41:15,457
You'd better
get to work, Jon Snow.

664
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:27,457
( chatter )

665
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:41,747
How much do we have?

666
00:41:41,748 --> 00:41:43,830
4,000 bushels,
my lady.

667
00:41:43,831 --> 00:41:44,997
What does
that mean?

668
00:41:44,998 --> 00:41:47,080
For the current
occupants of the castle,

669
00:41:47,081 --> 00:41:50,747
it's enough food
for a year, perhaps more.

670
00:41:50,748 --> 00:41:54,164
And what's the longest winter
in the past hundred years?

671
00:41:54,165 --> 00:41:56,622
Uh, I'm not
entirely certain.

672
00:41:56,623 --> 00:41:58,456
I-I'll check
Maester Luwin's records.

673
00:41:58,457 --> 00:42:01,955
He kept a copy
of every raven scroll.

674
00:42:01,956 --> 00:42:04,080
You're telling me
we don't have enough food,

675
00:42:04,081 --> 00:42:07,290
especially not if the armies of the North
come back to defend Winterfell?

676
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:10,788
No, my lady,
most likely not.

677
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:12,914
Then we must prepare
for that eventuality.

678
00:42:12,915 --> 00:42:14,997
Whatever direction
the threat comes from,

679
00:42:14,998 --> 00:42:17,289
this is
the best place to be.

680
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,247
We need to start
building up our grain stores

681
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:21,830
with regular shipments
from every keep in the North.

682
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:24,122
If we don't use it by winter's end,
we'll give it back to them.

683
00:42:24,123 --> 00:42:26,456
But if the entire North
has to flee to Winterfell,

684
00:42:26,457 --> 00:42:30,164
they won't have enough time
to bring wagonloads of grain with them.

685
00:42:30,165 --> 00:42:31,580
Very wise, my lady.

686
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:33,373
Maester Wolkan,
you'll see to it?

687
00:42:37,165 --> 00:42:39,663
Are they covering those
breastplates in leather?

688
00:42:39,664 --> 00:42:41,039
No, my lady.

689
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,122
Well, shouldn't they be?
Once the real cold comes?

690
00:42:44,123 --> 00:42:45,538
They should, indeed.

691
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:47,747
Pardon me, my lady.

692
00:42:47,748 --> 00:42:50,332
You there, why isn't there
leather on these?

693
00:42:52,332 --> 00:42:54,123
Command suits you.

694
00:42:55,831 --> 00:42:57,914
The Northerners
are all facing north,

695
00:42:57,915 --> 00:42:59,997
worried about the threat
from beyond the Wall.

696
00:42:59,998 --> 00:43:01,538
So they should be.

697
00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:04,206
I know Cersei
better than anyone here.

698
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,289
If you turn
your back on her--

699
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,036
You don't know Cersei
better than anyone here.

700
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,060
I only meant to say--

701
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:13,747
That the woman who murdered my mother,
father, and brother is dangerous?

702
00:43:13,748 --> 00:43:15,831
Thank you for
your wise counsel.

703
00:43:17,123 --> 00:43:19,331
One of two things
will happen--

704
00:43:19,332 --> 00:43:21,622
either the dead
will defeat the living,

705
00:43:21,623 --> 00:43:23,580
in which case...

706
00:43:23,581 --> 00:43:25,663
all our troubles
come to an end,

707
00:43:25,664 --> 00:43:28,039
or life will win out.

708
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,039
And what then?

709
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,040
Don't fight
in the North or the South.

710
00:43:35,623 --> 00:43:40,498
Fight every battle,
everywhere, always, in your mind.

711
00:43:42,415 --> 00:43:44,289
Everyone is your enemy,

712
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:47,206
everyone
is your friend...

713
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:51,331
every possible series of events
is happening all at once.

714
00:43:51,332 --> 00:43:54,914
Live that way
and nothing will surprise you.

715
00:43:54,915 --> 00:43:57,497
Everything that happens
will be something

716
00:43:57,498 --> 00:43:59,415
that you've seen before.

717
00:44:01,664 --> 00:44:04,415
Lady Sansa,
at the gate.

718
00:44:13,248 --> 00:44:14,706
( people murmuring )

719
00:44:36,956 --> 00:44:38,123
Hello, Sansa.

720
00:44:45,415 --> 00:44:47,290
( sobbing )

721
00:44:58,998 --> 00:45:01,122
I wish Jon were here.

722
00:45:01,123 --> 00:45:03,998
Yes, I need
to speak to him.

723
00:45:08,165 --> 00:45:10,789
You're Father's
last living trueborn son.

724
00:45:12,623 --> 00:45:15,497
You're Lord
of Winterfell now.

725
00:45:15,498 --> 00:45:18,747
I can never be
Lord of Winterfell.

726
00:45:18,748 --> 00:45:20,580
I can never be
lord of anything.

727
00:45:20,581 --> 00:45:21,831
I'm the Three-Eyed Raven.

728
00:45:23,915 --> 00:45:25,705
I don't know
what that means.

729
00:45:25,706 --> 00:45:28,122
It's difficult
to explain.

730
00:45:28,123 --> 00:45:30,332
Try.
Please, for me.

731
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,997
It means I can see
everything.

732
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:37,331
Everything that's
ever happened to everyone.

733
00:45:37,332 --> 00:45:40,331
Everything that's
happening right now.

734
00:45:40,332 --> 00:45:45,122
It's all pieces now,
fragments.

735
00:45:45,123 --> 00:45:47,331
I need to learn
to see better.

736
00:45:47,332 --> 00:45:50,747
When the Long Night
comes again,

737
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,373
I need to be ready.

738
00:45:55,415 --> 00:45:57,830
How do you know
all this?

739
00:45:57,831 --> 00:45:59,372
The Three-Eyed Raven
taught me.

740
00:45:59,373 --> 00:46:01,289
I thought you were
the Three-Eyed Raven.

741
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:04,039
I told you
it's difficult to explain.

742
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,206
( sighs )

743
00:46:06,207 --> 00:46:07,705
Bran--

744
00:46:07,706 --> 00:46:10,080
I'm sorry for all
that's happened to you.

745
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:14,081
I'm sorry it had to happen
here in our home.

746
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:21,373
It was so beautiful
that night.

747
00:46:23,373 --> 00:46:27,373
Snow falling,
just like now.

748
00:46:30,623 --> 00:46:32,457
And you were
so beautiful...

749
00:46:34,415 --> 00:46:36,207
in your white
wedding dress.

750
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:41,956
I have to go
back inside, Bran.

751
00:46:43,332 --> 00:46:45,040
I'll stay
a bit longer.

752
00:46:56,332 --> 00:46:58,747
( man coughing
in distance )

753
00:46:58,748 --> 00:47:00,290
Hmm.

754
00:47:08,789 --> 00:47:10,623
Hmm.

755
00:47:16,081 --> 00:47:17,955
Does it hurt?

756
00:47:17,956 --> 00:47:20,664
A bit.
Less than before.

757
00:47:22,457 --> 00:47:25,080
The infection no longer
appears to be active.

758
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:26,663
( sighs )

759
00:47:26,664 --> 00:47:28,497
Unusual.

760
00:47:28,498 --> 00:47:29,955
Unlikely.

761
00:47:29,956 --> 00:47:31,955
One could almost
be forgiven

762
00:47:31,956 --> 00:47:35,538
for thinking that the entire upper layer
of diseased skin was debrided

763
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:39,914
and the underlying region
treated with some sort of unguent.

764
00:47:39,915 --> 00:47:43,206
Don't know
anything about that.

765
00:47:43,207 --> 00:47:45,289
I just started
feeling better.

766
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:48,956
I assumed it was
the rest that did it.

767
00:47:50,915 --> 00:47:53,538
And the climate.

768
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:55,497
The climate.

769
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:57,289
You're free
to go, ser.

770
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:59,331
This chamber is needed
for the infectious,

771
00:47:59,332 --> 00:48:01,039
which you are
no longer.

772
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,539
Tarly, I'd like to speak with you
in my study this evening.

773
00:48:07,498 --> 00:48:08,789
How bad is it?

774
00:48:10,457 --> 00:48:11,831
Suppose I'll find out
this evening.

775
00:48:16,956 --> 00:48:19,663
- Where will you go?
- ( grunts )

776
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:23,373
I surrendered to this sickness
the moment I first saw it.

777
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,663
I knew
it would kill me

778
00:48:27,664 --> 00:48:30,331
or I'd kill myself
before it could.

779
00:48:30,332 --> 00:48:33,580
Daenerys Stormborn
convinced me otherwise.

780
00:48:33,581 --> 00:48:37,206
The only place for me
is back with her.

781
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:39,622
I owe her my life.

782
00:48:39,623 --> 00:48:42,206
Her and you.

783
00:48:42,207 --> 00:48:44,414
( chuckles )

784
00:48:44,415 --> 00:48:46,747
Your father saved me
more than once.

785
00:48:46,748 --> 00:48:48,539
It's the least
I could do.

786
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,414
Perhaps our paths
will cross again.

787
00:48:53,415 --> 00:48:54,831
I hope they do.

788
00:49:21,956 --> 00:49:22,941
Ebrose: You treated him?

789
00:49:22,965 --> 00:49:24,418
Yes.

790
00:49:25,415 --> 00:49:27,914
Who told you
to treat him?

791
00:49:27,915 --> 00:49:29,247
No one.

792
00:49:29,248 --> 00:49:32,538
Who forbade you, or anyone,
to attempt to treat him?

793
00:49:32,539 --> 00:49:35,247
I seem
to remember you.

794
00:49:35,248 --> 00:49:38,081
- But you treated him anyway?
- I did, yes.

795
00:49:39,748 --> 00:49:42,872
I forbade it because it is dangerous
and rarely successful,

796
00:49:42,873 --> 00:49:45,206
especially on
someone of that age.

797
00:49:45,207 --> 00:49:47,414
You could have infected
yourself and others.

798
00:49:47,415 --> 00:49:50,873
You could have devastated
the entire Citadel.

799
00:49:53,165 --> 00:49:55,080
But you didn't.

800
00:49:55,081 --> 00:49:57,705
It's a meticulous,
difficult procedure.

801
00:49:57,706 --> 00:50:01,122
Many maesters whose chains are
heavy with healing links

802
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,580
have attempted it
and failed.

803
00:50:03,581 --> 00:50:05,663
Yet you succeeded.

804
00:50:05,664 --> 00:50:06,789
How?

805
00:50:08,789 --> 00:50:12,081
I read the books
and followed the instructions.

806
00:50:22,457 --> 00:50:24,664
That man is alive
because of you.

807
00:50:26,956 --> 00:50:28,581
You should be proud.

808
00:50:31,664 --> 00:50:34,164
Thank you,
Archmaester.

809
00:50:34,165 --> 00:50:35,165
Come here.

810
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:42,788
All these manuscripts
and scrolls are rotting away.

811
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:45,457
I need you
to make copies of them.

812
00:50:49,748 --> 00:50:51,831
You were expecting
a reward.

813
00:50:53,539 --> 00:50:57,332
Your reward is not being
immediately expelled from the Citadel.

814
00:50:58,498 --> 00:51:00,497
You'd better
get started.

815
00:51:00,498 --> 00:51:02,164
And careful
of the paper mites.

816
00:51:02,165 --> 00:51:03,498
They like flesh
as well.

817
00:51:10,748 --> 00:51:14,122
We need to find
Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.

818
00:51:14,123 --> 00:51:17,622
Your Grace, he's already destroyed
a good portion of our fleet.

819
00:51:17,623 --> 00:51:19,164
To send our
remaining ships after him--

820
00:51:19,165 --> 00:51:21,831
I'm not talking about
sending our ships after him.

821
00:51:25,664 --> 00:51:27,206
Would you have to go
yourself?

822
00:51:27,207 --> 00:51:29,206
Euron's ships
could be anywhere

823
00:51:29,207 --> 00:51:31,206
or in more than
one place.

824
00:51:31,207 --> 00:51:33,622
You'd be flying around
the open seas alone

825
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:34,663
for who knows
how long.

826
00:51:34,664 --> 00:51:36,289
I wouldn't be alone.

827
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:38,872
I would have Drogon,
Viserion, and Rhaegal.

828
00:51:38,873 --> 00:51:40,663
What can anyone
do to them?

829
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:42,663
Missandei: They can still
do something to you.

830
00:51:42,664 --> 00:51:44,456
It only takes
one arrow.

831
00:51:44,457 --> 00:51:46,998
It's too great a risk.
You're too important.

832
00:51:49,332 --> 00:51:51,456
What about
Casterly Rock?

833
00:51:51,457 --> 00:51:53,414
The Unsullied
will be there soon.

834
00:51:53,415 --> 00:51:55,997
And what will they face?

835
00:51:55,998 --> 00:51:58,414
A difficult situation.

836
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:00,538
They know we're coming.

837
00:52:00,539 --> 00:52:03,872
Yes. Cersei believes
my sole purpose in life

838
00:52:03,873 --> 00:52:05,497
is to destroy
House Lannister.

839
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:07,248
She will be ready.

840
00:52:11,248 --> 00:52:13,872
- No one has ever taken the Rock.
- Man: Archers!

841
00:52:13,873 --> 00:52:16,247
Tyrion: The Lannister Army
is still the army my father built.

842
00:52:16,248 --> 00:52:18,580
- Come on!
- Tyrion: Well-trained and well-provisioned.

843
00:52:18,581 --> 00:52:20,372
10,000 men at least.

844
00:52:20,373 --> 00:52:21,373
They will see us coming.

845
00:52:25,915 --> 00:52:27,580
They will be ready.

846
00:52:27,581 --> 00:52:30,872
( men shouting )

847
00:52:30,873 --> 00:52:32,915
- Man: Draw! Loose!
- Man #2: Loose!

848
00:52:35,123 --> 00:52:38,248
Tyrion: The gates of Casterly Rock
are impregnable.

849
00:52:39,332 --> 00:52:41,457
( men grunting )

850
00:52:45,956 --> 00:52:48,206
The fight up the walls
will be hard.

851
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:49,748
We will be
at a disadvantage.

852
00:52:51,123 --> 00:52:52,789
- ( grunts )
- Many men will die.

853
00:52:54,956 --> 00:52:56,998
Just as my father
said they would.

854
00:52:59,165 --> 00:53:01,788
Interesting thing
about my father--

855
00:53:01,789 --> 00:53:03,705
he built our house up
from near ruin.

856
00:53:03,706 --> 00:53:07,872
He built our army,
he built Casterly Rock as we know it,

857
00:53:07,873 --> 00:53:09,955
but he didn't
build the sewers.

858
00:53:09,956 --> 00:53:12,039
That was beneath him,

859
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,914
so he gave the job
to the lowest person he could find--

860
00:53:14,915 --> 00:53:16,456
me.

861
00:53:16,457 --> 00:53:18,289
He was right,
I was low.

862
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:20,414
The company I kept, low.

863
00:53:20,415 --> 00:53:21,955
Women, mostly.

864
00:53:21,956 --> 00:53:23,622
They weren't welcome
at the Rock.

865
00:53:23,623 --> 00:53:25,914
Father disapproved
of that sort of behavior.

866
00:53:25,915 --> 00:53:27,538
Couldn't walk them
through the front gates,

867
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:28,997
I couldn't have them
in my chambers,

868
00:53:28,998 --> 00:53:31,247
so in the process
of building the sewers,

869
00:53:31,248 --> 00:53:33,998
I threw in something
for myself.

870
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,039
It was a passage
that began

871
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,747
in an out of the way cove
by the sea

872
00:53:39,748 --> 00:53:43,164
and ended beneath
one of the main guard towers.

873
00:53:43,165 --> 00:53:46,373
No better place for low pursuits
than beneath the ground.

874
00:53:47,998 --> 00:53:51,747
Casterly Rock
is an impregnable fortress.

875
00:53:51,748 --> 00:53:53,997
( grunts, wheezes )

876
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:57,663
But as a good friend of mine
once said,

877
00:53:57,664 --> 00:54:01,622
"Give me 10 good men
and I'll impregnate the bitch."

878
00:54:01,623 --> 00:54:04,165
- ( grunting )
- ( all shouting )

879
00:54:07,165 --> 00:54:08,373
And so it begins.

880
00:54:15,123 --> 00:54:17,997
They will face the bulk
of the Lannister forces.

881
00:54:17,998 --> 00:54:19,872
They will be outnumbered.

882
00:54:19,873 --> 00:54:22,207
They will have less armor
and fewer weapons.

883
00:54:27,165 --> 00:54:30,955
But my sister's armies
fight for her out of fear.

884
00:54:30,956 --> 00:54:33,914
The Unsullied will be fighting
for something greater.

885
00:54:33,915 --> 00:54:35,914
They will be fighting
for freedom

886
00:54:35,915 --> 00:54:37,705
and the person
who gave it to them.

887
00:54:37,706 --> 00:54:40,206
They will be fighting
for you.

888
00:54:40,207 --> 00:54:42,664
And that is why
they will triumph.

889
00:54:58,664 --> 00:55:00,415
( speaking Valyrian )

890
00:55:01,873 --> 00:55:04,081
( Grey Worm speaking
Valyrian )

891
00:55:08,123 --> 00:55:11,081
( distant explosions )

892
00:55:29,415 --> 00:55:30,622
Where are they?!

893
00:55:30,623 --> 00:55:33,248
Where are the rest
of the Lannisters?

894
00:56:03,248 --> 00:56:06,290
( men shouting )

895
00:56:28,165 --> 00:56:29,706
( chatter )

896
00:56:55,873 --> 00:56:58,081
( door opens )

897
00:57:02,123 --> 00:57:04,373
- It's done.
- It is.

898
00:57:06,248 --> 00:57:10,373
And now the rains weep
o'er our halls.

899
00:57:12,706 --> 00:57:14,164
Did we fight well?

900
00:57:14,165 --> 00:57:17,206
Uh, as well
as could be expected.

901
00:57:17,207 --> 00:57:19,331
It was never our forte.

902
00:57:19,332 --> 00:57:21,415
Golden roses, indeed.

903
00:57:23,332 --> 00:57:25,372
Your brother
and his new queen

904
00:57:25,373 --> 00:57:28,289
thought you would be
defending Casterly Rock.

905
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:31,580
The truth is Casterly Rock
isn't worth much anymore.

906
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:33,164
Well, it is to me,

907
00:57:33,165 --> 00:57:35,497
but my fond
childhood memories

908
00:57:35,498 --> 00:57:37,039
won't keep Cersei
on the throne.

909
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,164
So you just
let them take it?

910
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:41,206
For now.
They won't be able to hold it.

911
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:43,747
Euron Greyjoy's navy
burned their ships,

912
00:57:43,748 --> 00:57:45,747
we emptied the larders
before we left.

913
00:57:45,748 --> 00:57:47,997
Eventually, they'll be forced
to abandon their position

914
00:57:47,998 --> 00:57:51,414
and march all the way
across Westeros.

915
00:57:51,415 --> 00:57:54,580
And you took your army,
your real army,

916
00:57:54,581 --> 00:57:56,456
and went
where they weren't.

917
00:57:56,457 --> 00:57:59,788
As Robb Stark did to me
at Whispering Wood.

918
00:57:59,789 --> 00:58:01,830
There are always
lessons in failures.

919
00:58:01,831 --> 00:58:05,415
Yes. You must be
very wise by now.

920
00:58:06,706 --> 00:58:09,580
My father always said
I was a slow learner.

921
00:58:09,581 --> 00:58:11,331
If he was so clever,

922
00:58:11,332 --> 00:58:13,080
why didn't he take
Highgarden

923
00:58:13,081 --> 00:58:16,788
the moment
your gold mines ran dry?

924
00:58:16,789 --> 00:58:18,331
( scoffs )

925
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:22,247
I suppose I'll be able
to ask him myself soon enough.

926
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:25,332
No more learning
from my mistakes, eh?

927
00:58:27,789 --> 00:58:30,289
How will you do it?

928
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:32,747
With that sword?

929
00:58:32,748 --> 00:58:35,122
That was Joffrey's sword,
wasn't it?

930
00:58:35,123 --> 00:58:37,456
Not that
he ever used it.

931
00:58:37,457 --> 00:58:39,123
What did he call it?

932
00:58:40,748 --> 00:58:43,080
Widow's Wail.

933
00:58:43,081 --> 00:58:45,290
He really was a cunt,
wasn't he?

934
00:58:46,915 --> 00:58:52,289
I did unspeakable things
to protect my family.

935
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:56,331
Or watched them
being done on my orders.

936
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:59,497
I never lost
a night's sleep over them.

937
00:58:59,498 --> 00:59:01,538
They were necessary.

938
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:03,580
And whatever
I imagined necessary

939
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:07,497
for the safety
of House Tyrell, I did.

940
00:59:07,498 --> 00:59:12,123
But your sister
has done things...

941
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:16,122
I was incapable
of imagining.

942
00:59:16,123 --> 00:59:18,955
That was
my prize mistake--

943
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:21,498
a failure
of imagination.

944
00:59:22,831 --> 00:59:25,289
She's a monster,
you do know that?

945
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:27,456
To you, I'm sure.

946
00:59:27,457 --> 00:59:29,331
To others as well.

947
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:32,830
But after we've won
and there's no one left to oppose us,

948
00:59:32,831 --> 00:59:37,164
when people are living peacefully
in the world she built,

949
00:59:37,165 --> 00:59:40,873
do you really think they'll wring their hands
over the way she built it?

950
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:45,497
You love her.

951
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,289
You really do
love her.

952
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:49,747
You poor fool.

953
00:59:49,748 --> 00:59:51,497
She'll be
the end of you.

954
00:59:51,498 --> 00:59:54,039
Possibly.

955
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,830
Not much
to be gained

956
00:59:55,831 --> 00:59:57,872
from discussing it
with you, though, is there?

957
00:59:57,873 --> 01:00:00,580
What better person
to discuss it with?

958
01:00:00,581 --> 01:00:02,497
What better guarantee
could you have

959
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:06,538
that the things you say
will never leave this room?

960
01:00:06,539 --> 01:00:09,580
But perhaps
you're right.

961
01:00:09,581 --> 01:00:11,164
If she's driven you
this far,

962
01:00:11,165 --> 01:00:13,581
it's gone beyond
your control.

963
01:00:14,873 --> 01:00:16,872
Yes.

964
01:00:16,873 --> 01:00:18,332
It has.

965
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:21,456
She's a disease.

966
01:00:21,457 --> 01:00:24,414
I regret my role
in spreading it.

967
01:00:24,415 --> 01:00:25,997
You will, too.

968
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:27,748
I think
we're done here.

969
01:00:31,165 --> 01:00:32,207
How will it happen?

970
01:00:33,748 --> 01:00:35,663
Cersei had
several ideas.

971
01:00:35,664 --> 01:00:37,080
Whipping you
through the streets

972
01:00:37,081 --> 01:00:39,747
and beheading you
in front of the Red Keep.

973
01:00:39,748 --> 01:00:43,581
Flaying you alive and hanging you from
the walls of King's Landing.

974
01:00:46,748 --> 01:00:48,539
I talked her
out of those.

975
01:01:05,789 --> 01:01:07,206
Will there be pain?

976
01:01:07,207 --> 01:01:09,788
No. I made sure
of that.

977
01:01:09,789 --> 01:01:11,123
That's good.

978
01:01:23,915 --> 01:01:25,915
I'd hate to die
like your son.

979
01:01:27,123 --> 01:01:28,580
Clawing at my neck,

980
01:01:28,581 --> 01:01:31,456
foam and bile spilling
from my mouth,

981
01:01:31,457 --> 01:01:35,289
eyes bloodred,
skin purple.

982
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:37,663
Must have been
horrible for you,

983
01:01:37,664 --> 01:01:41,122
as a Kingsguard,
as a father.

984
01:01:41,123 --> 01:01:43,705
It was horrible
enough for me.

985
01:01:43,706 --> 01:01:46,372
A shocking scene.

986
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:49,165
Not at all
what I intended.

987
01:01:51,123 --> 01:01:55,706
You see, I had never seen
the poison work before.

988
01:02:00,664 --> 01:02:02,830
Tell Cersei.

989
01:02:02,831 --> 01:02:05,290
I want her to know
it was me.

990

♪ <font color="#FFFF00">( music playing )</font> ♪

991

My only venture at this moment

992
01:03:50,617 --> 01:03:53,241
is reestablishing control
over this continent

993
01:03:53,242 --> 01:03:54,784

DAENERYS TARGARYEN:
All my allies are gone.

I'm losing.
