1
00:00:01,092 --> 00:00:03,512
Why did you come to King's Landing,
Prince Oberyn?

2
00:00:03,632 --> 00:00:06,937
If the Mountain killed my sister,
your father gave the order.

3
00:00:07,057 --> 00:00:09,536
The Lannisters aren't the only ones
that pay their debts.

4
00:00:09,656 --> 00:00:11,131
Ser Dontos...

5
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:15,396
Once I was a knight, now I am only a fool.
But a living fool, thanks to you.

6
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,135
— It's not a good time.
— It's never a good time.

7
00:00:18,255 --> 00:00:22,305
You have your child bride.
If you want me to leave, just say it.

8
00:00:24,493 --> 00:00:27,409
You told me to come at once if there was
anything important.

9
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:31,308
I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister, Meera.

10
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:33,343
We've come a long way to find you,
Brandon.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,331
You're a warg. It's in your blood.

12
00:00:36,718 --> 00:00:40,016
I don't want you talking to me anymore,
until we get to Castle Black.

13
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:41,416
We're not going to Castle Black.

14
00:00:41,463 --> 00:00:43,531
Bran needs to find the raven
beyond the Wall.

15
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:48,346
I thank God for bringing Melisandre to us.

16
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:50,681
She gave you a son.

17
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,777
I gave you nothing.

18
00:00:54,897 --> 00:00:57,786
That's not true.
I want to see my daughter.

19
00:01:00,497 --> 00:01:04,530
I am marrying my eldest son
to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden.

20
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,416
You don't really plan on staying
in the King's Guard, do you?

21
00:01:07,755 --> 00:01:11,997
Ser Jaime Lannister, a 40 year old knight
with one hand.

22
00:01:12,117 --> 00:01:15,220
I use my left hand now, Your Grace.
Makes it more of a contest.

23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,743
— Winterfell is in ruins.
— What happened out there?

24
00:01:17,863 --> 00:01:20,154
I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place.

25
00:01:20,274 --> 00:01:22,794
I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.

26
00:01:22,914 --> 00:01:27,952
— Please...
— What is your name?

27
00:01:28,072 --> 00:01:29,437
Reek...

— ( screams )
— There you are.

37
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:52,744
( barking )

38
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:53,724
( screaming )

39
00:03:53,856 --> 00:03:56,057
I can't see her, Ramsay.

40
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:59,478
( panting )

41
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,146
Tansy!

42
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:03,865
( whimpering )

43
00:04:04,606 --> 00:04:07,691
If you make it out
of the woods, you win!

44
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:10,194
Run, Tansy, run!

45
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:13,163
( screams )

46
00:04:13,198 --> 00:04:16,116
( whimpering )

47
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:18,702
( panting, crying )

Ramsay:<i> — Tansy.</i>
Woman:<i> — Where is she?</i>

49
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:25,008
Ramsay:<i> — Tansy, Tansy, Tansy!</i>
( barking )

50
00:04:26,878 --> 00:04:29,463
( whimpering )

51
00:04:35,603 --> 00:04:37,554
( screams )

52
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,228
( crying )

53
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,839
Good girls.
Down, girls.

54
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,874
Down.

55
00:04:49,994 --> 00:04:51,909
Well done.
You, too.

56
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:55,405
— I only wounded her.
— You brought her down. That's what matters.

57
00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:58,125
A fine shot.
Wasn't it, Reek?

58
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:00,327
A fine shot, master.
My lady.

59
00:05:00,378 --> 00:05:02,579
Please, my lord.
It hurts.

60
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,249
Oh, sweet.
Don't cry.

61
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:07,900
It will be over soon.

62
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,505
She thinks she's pretty.

63
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:13,056
Let me put one through her face.

64
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:14,641
We have to reward
the hounds, love.

65
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:15,807
They did all the hard work.

66
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:18,264
Why? I did
whatever you asked.

67
00:05:18,512 --> 00:05:20,411
But you made Myranda
feel jealous.

68
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:23,255
— Me jealous of her?
— <i> My lord, please.</i>

69
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:26,987
You can see that your presence
has become a bit of a problem.

70
00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:28,989
— ( crying )
— ( dogs snarling, barking )

71
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:31,024
Rip her!
Rip her!

72
00:05:31,075 --> 00:05:33,110
— Rip her!
— <i> ( Tansy screaming )</i>

73
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:35,428
<i>( tearing )</i>

74
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:37,575
Not so pretty now.

75
00:05:50,295 --> 00:05:53,547
Tyrion: — <i>Your new hand, it's
nicer than the old one.</i>

76
00:05:53,598 --> 00:05:54,881
Wouldn't you agree, Pod?

77
00:05:54,932 --> 00:05:56,967
Is it solid gold?

78
00:05:57,018 --> 00:06:00,020
Gilded steel.
You're not eating.

79
00:06:00,054 --> 00:06:01,972
Why is no one eating?

80
00:06:01,974 --> 00:06:04,775
My wife wastes away and my
brother starves himself.

81
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:06,810
— I'm not hungry.
— You lost a hand,

82
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:09,146
not a stomach.

83
00:06:09,148 --> 00:06:10,981
Try the boar.

84
00:06:10,983 --> 00:06:14,034
Cersei can't get enough of it
since one killed Robert for her.

85
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:17,321
A toast.

86
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:20,707
To the proud Lannister children.

87
00:06:20,742 --> 00:06:23,627
The dwarf, the cripple,
and the mother of madness.

88
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:25,278
— Oh!
— I'll clean it up.

89
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:27,331
No, I'll do it.
Leave us.

90
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:32,469
It's only wine.

91
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:43,513
I can't fight anymore.

92
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:45,182
What about your left?

93
00:06:46,684 --> 00:06:50,020
I can hold a sword, but all
my instincts are wrong.

94
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:52,155
How can I protect the king

95
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,857
when I can hardly
wipe my own ass?

96
00:06:53,908 --> 00:06:56,526
You're the Lord Commander now.
Command.

97
00:06:56,528 --> 00:06:59,446
Let others do the fighting.

98
00:06:59,497 --> 00:07:02,666
When was the last time
Father used a sword?

99
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,085
I'm not Father.
I'm the Kingslayer.

100
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:07,254
When people find out
I can't slay a pigeon...

101
00:07:07,288 --> 00:07:10,540
Train, then.
Learn to fight with your other hand.

102
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:13,927
With whom? You?
Men talk.

103
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:16,513
Soon as someone discovers I can't
fight, he'll tell everyone.

104
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,052
You need a proper,
discreet swordsman.

105
00:07:22,103 --> 00:07:25,722
As it happens,
I have just the one.

106
00:07:34,482 --> 00:07:37,567
My brother tells me you
can keep your mouth shut.

107
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:39,569
Unusual talent for a sellsword.

108
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:41,738
He tells me you shit gold

109
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:44,624
just like your father.

110
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,543
Is this place safe?

111
00:07:48,746 --> 00:07:51,081
There's this knight, Leygood,

112
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,717
— got thunderbolts on his shield.
— Uh–huh.

113
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:56,253
Right here is where
I fuck his wife.

114
00:07:56,255 --> 00:07:58,588
She's a screamer, that one.

115
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,341
If they don't hear her,
they won't hear us.

116
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:05,595
( whistles ) I've never
seen Valyrian steel before.

117
00:08:05,597 --> 00:08:07,981
She's a beauty.
The problem is,

118
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:10,350
if you fight with
an edged blade,

119
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:12,569
I'll have to.

120
00:08:12,603 --> 00:08:14,020
And if I fight with
an edged blade,

121
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:16,490
I'll have no one left to pay me.

122
00:08:16,524 --> 00:08:18,241
( blade clatters )

123
00:08:18,276 --> 00:08:20,610
I haven't used a sparring
sword since I was nine.

124
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,167
Ah!

125
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:30,504
Bold warrior you are, attacking
a man when his guard's down.

126
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:32,839
Best time to attack a man.

127
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:36,877
Mind yourself.

128
00:08:38,713 --> 00:08:41,298
— If I still had my right hand...
— Plan on growing it back?

129
00:08:55,897 --> 00:08:57,697
Come on, then.

130
00:09:08,993 --> 00:09:10,911
Man:
<i>Open the gates!</i>

131
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:14,831
<i>Riders coming in!</i>

132
00:09:18,002 --> 00:09:19,803
( horse whinnies )

133
00:09:30,515 --> 00:09:33,350
Man: — <i>Let's get these
horses seen to!</i>

134
00:09:35,653 --> 00:09:37,821
Father.
Welcome home.

135
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:41,942
Walda, this is
Ramsay Snow, my bastard.

136
00:09:41,993 --> 00:09:44,027
A pleasure, Mother.

137
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:46,112
Hello.

138
00:09:46,163 --> 00:09:48,832
Roose: — <i>See that the horses are
fed, watered, and rubbed down.</i>

139
00:09:48,866 --> 00:09:52,168
And take Lady Walda
to her chambers.

140
00:09:52,203 --> 00:09:54,204
This way, my lady.

141
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:56,339
Where is your prize?

142
00:09:56,374 --> 00:09:57,958
With the hounds.

143
00:09:59,343 --> 00:10:01,595
I'll have a look at him.

144
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:09,219
I hear you took a hand
from the Kingslayer.

145
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,055
Word travels.
How he screamed.

146
00:10:12,057 --> 00:10:14,558
— You would have loved it.
— ( laughs )

147
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:25,735
Father.

148
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:36,046
What did you do to him?

149
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,383
I trained him.
He was a slow learner, but he learned.

150
00:10:40,418 --> 00:10:43,053
You flayed him.

151
00:10:43,087 --> 00:10:45,422
Peeled a few bits.

152
00:10:45,473 --> 00:10:47,424
Removed a few others.

153
00:10:49,927 --> 00:10:52,312
This was Balon Greyjoy's
son and heir.

154
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:54,764
We've been flaying
our enemies for 1,000 years.

155
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:56,850
The flayed man
is on our banners.

156
00:10:56,901 --> 00:10:58,735
My banners, not yours.

157
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:00,770
You're not a Bolton.
You're a Snow.

158
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:06,943
Tywin Lannister has given
me the North.

159
00:11:06,994 --> 00:11:09,496
But he won't lift a finger
to help me take it.

160
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,414
As long as the ironborn
hold Moat Cailin,

161
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:13,650
<i>our armies are trapped</i>
<i>south of the Neck.</i>

162
00:11:13,684 --> 00:11:16,953
Theon was a valuable
hostage, not your plaything.

163
00:11:16,955 --> 00:11:20,423
I wanted to trade him
for Moat Cailin.

164
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,258
I already asked.

165
00:11:22,293 --> 00:11:25,762
Lord Greyjoy refused.
Savages have no–

166
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:28,798
You sent terms to Balon
Greyjoy without my consent?

167
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,884
You made me acting
Lord of the Dreadfort.

168
00:11:30,935 --> 00:11:32,385
I acted.

169
00:11:38,392 --> 00:11:41,027
I had to smuggle myself
into my own lands

170
00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:42,862
thanks to the Greyjoys.

171
00:11:42,897 --> 00:11:44,864
I needed Theon.

172
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:46,816
I needed him whole.

173
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:50,320
Theon was our enemy.

174
00:11:50,371 --> 00:11:52,372
But Reek,

175
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:55,241
Reek will never betray us.

176
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,995
I placed far too much
trust in you.

177
00:12:07,805 --> 00:12:11,675
Reek, how could you let me stand
before my father unshaven?

178
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:15,178
— <i> It's disrespectful.</i>
— I'm sorry, my lord.

179
00:12:17,398 --> 00:12:19,516
Give him the razor.

180
00:12:27,358 --> 00:12:30,610
If I'm not a Bolton,
Father, what does it matter?

181
00:12:38,753 --> 00:12:40,286
Go on, Reek.

182
00:12:40,337 --> 00:12:42,756
<i>A nice close shave.</i>

183
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:06,479
Reek, tell Father

184
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,566
where are Bran and Rickon Stark?

185
00:13:09,568 --> 00:13:11,618
I don't know, my lord.

186
00:13:11,652 --> 00:13:13,403
You murdered them

187
00:13:13,437 --> 00:13:17,207
and displayed their corpses
at Winterfell.

188
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:20,660
Ramsay:<i> — Reek,</i>

189
00:13:20,694 --> 00:13:22,912
did you murder the Stark boys?

190
00:13:22,963 --> 00:13:25,131
No, my lord.

191
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,416
Just two farm boys.

192
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:29,419
Ramsay: — <i>And crisped them
so no one would know.</i>

193
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,088
Theon:
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

194
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:36,593
The Starks have always
ruled the North.

195
00:13:36,644 --> 00:13:39,312
If Bran and Rickon are alive,

196
00:13:39,346 --> 00:13:41,931
the country will rally
to their side

197
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:44,150
now that Robb Stark is gone.

198
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,189
<i>Oh, that's right, Reek.</i>

199
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:52,659
Robb Stark is dead.

200
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:55,445
<i>Sorry.</i>

201
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:57,747
<i>I know he was like</i>
<i>a brother to you.</i>

202
00:13:57,782 --> 00:14:00,700
But my father put a knife
through his heart.

203
00:14:04,004 --> 00:14:06,122
How do you feel about that?

204
00:14:19,603 --> 00:14:22,021
— You ready for a hunt?
— Always.

205
00:14:22,056 --> 00:14:25,308
Find those boys and I'll give
you 1,000 acres and a holdfast.

206
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,360
Your pet rat have any thoughts

207
00:14:27,394 --> 00:14:29,612
on which way they went
after Winterfell?

208
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:33,783
Jon Snow is at Castle Black.

209
00:14:35,202 --> 00:14:37,153
Who the fuck is Jon Snow?

210
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:38,538
Their bastard brother.

211
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:40,824
He could be sheltering them.

212
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,458
He may know where they are.

213
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,547
Even if he doesn't,
he's half Stark himself.

214
00:14:47,581 --> 00:14:49,215
Could be a threat.

215
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,401
You want to prove
yourself a Bolton?

216
00:14:51,435 --> 00:14:55,004
Gather whatever men you can
and ride for Moat Cailin.

217
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:57,257
Bring this creature of yours.

218
00:14:58,475 --> 00:15:00,593
Maybe he'll be of some use.

219
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,014
Take the Moat for the family,

220
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:06,733
for<i> our</i> family,

221
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:09,269
and I'll reconsider
your position.

222
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:15,825
Lord Varys.
Breakfasting with the king?

223
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,162
I'm afraid foreigners aren't
welcome at such exclusive affairs.

224
00:15:19,196 --> 00:15:21,998
— Oh, to be foreign.
— Ahem.

225
00:15:22,032 --> 00:15:24,167
Shae has been noticed.

226
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:25,702
Sansa's maid saw you with her.

227
00:15:25,704 --> 00:15:27,420
She already told your sister.

228
00:15:27,504 --> 00:15:29,706
It's only a matter of time
before your father hears.

229
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,876
So I'm guilty of being seen
with my own wife's handmaiden.

230
00:15:32,927 --> 00:15:34,711
My father will ask you
if there's anything more

231
00:15:34,713 --> 00:15:36,379
and you'll tell him
some clever lie.

232
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,131
No, I will not.

233
00:15:38,182 --> 00:15:41,434
How long do you imagine your father
and sister would let me live

234
00:15:41,468 --> 00:15:43,803
if they suspected me of lying?

235
00:15:43,854 --> 00:15:46,222
I have no pet sellsword
to protect me.

236
00:15:46,273 --> 00:15:48,308
No legendary brother
to avenge me.

237
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:50,777
<i>Only little birds</i>
<i>who whisper in my ear.</i>

238
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:52,595
Forgive me
if I don't weep for you.

239
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,648
No one weeps
for spiders or whores.

240
00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:58,818
I have friends across
the sea who could help her.

241
00:15:58,869 --> 00:16:00,370
She won't leave.

242
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:01,654
I've told her this is
a dangerous place

243
00:16:01,705 --> 00:16:03,573
so many times,
she no longer believes it.

244
00:16:03,624 --> 00:16:06,576
Your father has promised to hang
the next whore he finds you with.

245
00:16:06,627 --> 00:16:10,163
Have you ever known your
father to make an idle threat?

246
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:15,385
From House Tyrell and the
people of the Reach,

247
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:19,589
Your Grace, it is my honor to
present you with this wedding cup.

248
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,175
May you and my daughter Margaery

249
00:16:22,226 --> 00:16:24,010
drink deep and live long.

250
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:26,429
A handsome goblet, my lord.

251
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,098
Or shall I call you Father?

252
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:31,684
I shall be honored, Your Grace.

253
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:41,427
She's the whore
I told you about.

254
00:16:41,462 --> 00:16:43,279
The dark-haired one.

255
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:47,951
Have her brought to the Tower
of the Hand before the wedding.

256
00:16:58,462 --> 00:16:59,796
A book?

257
00:16:59,798 --> 00:17:02,265
«The Lives of Four Kings.»
Grand Maester Kaeth's history

258
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:04,600
of the reigns of
Daeron the Young Dragon,

259
00:17:04,635 --> 00:17:09,105
Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the
Unworthy, and Daeron the Good.

260
00:17:09,139 --> 00:17:10,807
A book every king should read.

261
00:17:19,984 --> 00:17:21,985
Now that the war is won,

262
00:17:22,036 --> 00:17:25,204
we should all find
time for wisdom.

263
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,491
Thank you, Uncle.

264
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:42,755
One of only two Valyrian
steel swords in the capital,

265
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:46,676
Your Grace, freshly
forged in your honor.

266
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,509
Careful, Your Grace.
Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.

267
00:18:03,544 --> 00:18:05,828
So they say.

268
00:18:14,054 --> 00:18:15,872
( panting )

269
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:19,425
Such a great sword
should have a name.

270
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,261
— What shall I call her?
— Man:<i> Stormbringer.</i>

271
00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:24,430
— Man #2:<i> Terminus.</i>
— Man #3:<i> Widow's Wail.</i>

272
00:18:24,465 --> 00:18:26,966
— Man #4:<i> Wolfsbane.</i>
— Widow's Wail. I like that.

273
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:29,302
( chuckles )

274
00:18:29,353 --> 00:18:31,387
Every time I use it,
it'll be like cutting off

275
00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:33,056
Ned Stark's head all over again.

276
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:57,080
<i>( door opens )</i>

277
00:19:01,502 --> 00:19:03,302
Don't.

278
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:07,390
You want me on the desk?

279
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,062
— <i> What's wrong, my lion?</i>
— Don't call me that.

280
00:19:13,097 --> 00:19:15,765
What should I call you?

281
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:18,768
I'm afraid our friendship
can't continue.

282
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,570
Our friendship?

283
00:19:20,604 --> 00:19:22,939
There's a ship waiting in
the harbor bound for Pentos.

284
00:19:24,024 --> 00:19:25,191
What?

285
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:26,659
You'll have your own
cabin, of course,

286
00:19:26,693 --> 00:19:31,080
and across the Narrow Sea
a house, servants.

287
00:19:32,332 --> 00:19:33,783
What is this?

288
00:19:33,785 --> 00:19:36,002
I'm a married man.

289
00:19:36,036 --> 00:19:38,921
My wife has suffered a great
deal, as you well know.

290
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:42,091
<i>I don't want her to suffer
anymore on my account.</i>

291
00:19:42,126 --> 00:19:44,293
I need to uphold my vows.

292
00:19:44,295 --> 00:19:46,963
She doesn't want you.

293
00:19:46,965 --> 00:19:49,632
— <i> I need to do right by her.</i>
— You don't want her.

294
00:19:49,634 --> 00:19:51,350
By our children.

295
00:19:53,637 --> 00:19:55,721
— What are you afraid of?
— I'm not afraid.

296
00:19:55,772 --> 00:19:59,142
You are. You are afraid of
your father and your sister.

297
00:19:59,193 --> 00:20:01,861
— You're going to run from them all your life?
— I need you to leave.

298
00:20:01,895 --> 00:20:04,897
I'm not afraid of them.
I'm not going to run.

299
00:20:04,948 --> 00:20:07,283
— Shae.
— We will fight them together.

300
00:20:07,317 --> 00:20:09,652
It's like you said,
I am yours and you are mine.

301
00:20:09,703 --> 00:20:11,821
You're a whore!

302
00:20:14,158 --> 00:20:17,043
Sansa is fit to bear
my children and you are not.

303
00:20:17,077 --> 00:20:19,545
I can't be in love with a whore.

304
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,998
I can't have children
with a whore.

305
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,717
How many men have you been with?

306
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:27,003
500? 5,000?

307
00:20:32,843 --> 00:20:35,294
How many whores
have you been with?

308
00:20:35,329 --> 00:20:37,480
I have enjoyed my time
with all of them

309
00:20:37,514 --> 00:20:39,599
and I have enjoyed my time
with you most of all.

310
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,934
But now that time is over.

311
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:47,823
<i>( Shae crying )</i>

312
00:20:57,701 --> 00:21:00,920
You'll have a comfortable
life in Pentos.

313
00:21:02,923 --> 00:21:05,791
Bronn will escort you
to your ship.

314
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,728
<i>( door closes )</i>

315
00:21:31,235 --> 00:21:33,786
<i> ( woman screaming )</i>
Melisandre: — Hear us now.

316
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,405
Accept these tokens
of our faith, my lord,

317
00:21:36,407 --> 00:21:38,374
and lead us from the darkness.

318
00:21:38,408 --> 00:21:39,909
( crying )

319
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,628
Sire, I served you well.

320
00:21:42,663 --> 00:21:45,581
<i>( crowd chanting ) Lord of
Light, show us the way...</i>

321
00:21:45,632 --> 00:21:50,052
Selyse, you're my sister!

322
00:21:50,087 --> 00:21:51,587
Yours are the stars
that guide us.

323
00:21:51,638 --> 00:21:54,257
Tell him!
Tell him!

324
00:21:54,424 --> 00:21:56,475
Melisandre: — <i>Lord of Light, protect us,</i>

325
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,261
for the night is dark
and full of terrors.

326
00:21:58,263 --> 00:22:00,646
( screaming )

327
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:12,858
Did you see?
Their souls.

328
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:15,328
It was their souls.

329
00:22:15,362 --> 00:22:18,414
Our lord took them.
Did you see?

330
00:22:24,955 --> 00:22:27,957
Lord Florent was
your brother by law.

331
00:22:28,008 --> 00:22:30,293
He was an infidel.

332
00:22:30,295 --> 00:22:32,795
He worshipped the gods
of his fathers

333
00:22:32,797 --> 00:22:34,964
and their fathers before him.

334
00:22:35,015 --> 00:22:37,633
They were the gods
of your fathers, too.

335
00:22:37,684 --> 00:22:39,969
I ordered him to tear
down his idols.

336
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,470
He disobeyed.

337
00:22:41,472 --> 00:22:43,806
How many ships did he
bring to your cause?

338
00:22:43,808 --> 00:22:45,107
How many men?

339
00:22:45,142 --> 00:22:47,476
A good deal more than you.

340
00:22:48,945 --> 00:22:50,780
Did you see, Ser Davos?

341
00:22:50,814 --> 00:22:52,114
They're with our lord now.

342
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:54,650
Their sins all burned away.
Did you see?

343
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:57,370
I'm sure they're more
than grateful, my queen.

344
00:23:09,132 --> 00:23:11,634
( sniffs )

345
00:23:11,668 --> 00:23:13,419
Meat's off.

346
00:23:14,838 --> 00:23:17,173
Our larders are almost empty.

347
00:23:17,224 --> 00:23:19,258
Serve fish, then.
We're on an island.

348
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:20,843
You hate fish.

349
00:23:20,894 --> 00:23:23,679
I hate a good many things,
but I suffer them all the same.

350
00:23:25,232 --> 00:23:29,101
When Storm's End was under
siege and I was starving,

351
00:23:29,152 --> 00:23:33,239
<i>Stannis boiled soup</i>
<i>for me from books.</i>

352
00:23:33,273 --> 00:23:36,359
The binding glue
is made from horses.

353
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:43,916
One morning, he shot two
seagulls on the beach.

354
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,620
I've never tasted anything
as good as grilled seagull.

355
00:23:48,872 --> 00:23:51,374
— Do you remember?
— Of course I remember.

356
00:23:54,044 --> 00:23:56,679
Have you ever known
true hunger, my lady?

357
00:23:56,713 --> 00:23:58,881
<i>It's all I knew</i>
<i>when I was a child.</i>

358
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:01,100
Until you found
the Lord of Light?

359
00:24:01,134 --> 00:24:03,686
Until he found me.

360
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,812
I fear for our daughter's soul.

361
00:24:14,531 --> 00:24:16,399
<i>Every mother should fear</i>
<i>for her child's soul.</i>

362
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:18,567
— She's a stubborn little beast.
— She's a child.

363
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:20,703
You barely know her.

364
00:24:20,737 --> 00:24:23,572
You think she's sweet because
she smiles when you visit.

365
00:24:23,623 --> 00:24:25,908
She's sullen and stubborn
and sinful.

366
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,961
Why else would the Lord of Light
have seen fit to mark her face?

367
00:24:28,995 --> 00:24:30,546
She needs the rod.

368
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,049
She's my daughter.
You will not strike her.

369
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:37,086
As you command.

370
00:24:39,172 --> 00:24:41,590
Perhaps the Lady Melisandre
could speak with her.

371
00:24:45,178 --> 00:24:47,897
<i>( knocks )</i>

372
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:50,983
Come in.

373
00:24:53,153 --> 00:24:55,438
Were you sleeping, Princess?

374
00:25:00,076 --> 00:25:02,445
Did you watch the ceremony
on the beach?

375
00:25:02,447 --> 00:25:04,864
I heard it.

376
00:25:04,915 --> 00:25:06,499
And it frightened you?

377
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:08,417
Ser Axel was my uncle.

378
00:25:08,452 --> 00:25:10,703
<i>He was always kind to me.</i>

379
00:25:10,754 --> 00:25:12,705
They're in a better
place now, Princess.

380
00:25:12,756 --> 00:25:15,591
<i>The fire cleansed them</i>
<i>of the sins of the world.</i>

381
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:17,209
But they screamed.

382
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,261
Women scream
when they give birth.

383
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:21,881
Afterward they are
filled with joy.

384
00:25:21,932 --> 00:25:23,599
Afterward they aren't
ash and bone.

385
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:25,634
You have so many
questions, don't you?

386
00:25:25,636 --> 00:25:27,853
<i>So did I when I was a child.</i>

387
00:25:27,888 --> 00:25:30,222
I was much like you.

388
00:25:30,273 --> 00:25:32,858
Only I wasn't a princess.

389
00:25:32,893 --> 00:25:34,477
And you didn't have this.

390
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:36,362
No.

391
00:25:36,396 --> 00:25:39,315
But I suffered in other ways,
sweet girl, believe me.

392
00:25:39,317 --> 00:25:41,734
What do you know of the gods?

393
00:25:41,785 --> 00:25:44,036
I read
«The Seven-Pointed Star.»

394
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,822
Lies and fables.

395
00:25:46,873 --> 00:25:49,909
Septons speak of seven gods.

396
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,494
There are but two–

397
00:25:51,545 --> 00:25:53,913
a god of light and love and joy

398
00:25:53,964 --> 00:25:57,583
and a god of darkness,
evil, and fear.

399
00:25:57,634 --> 00:25:59,335
Eternally at war.

400
00:25:59,386 --> 00:26:03,389
There are no seven heavens
and no seven hells?

401
00:26:04,674 --> 00:26:07,176
There's only one hell, Princess.

402
00:26:07,178 --> 00:26:10,346
The one we live in now.

403
00:26:10,397 --> 00:26:13,098
<i>( heavy breathing )</i>

404
00:26:37,507 --> 00:26:39,875
<i>( growls )</i>

405
00:26:44,631 --> 00:26:47,550
— <i> Hodor.</i>
— ( breathing heavily )

406
00:26:51,638 --> 00:26:52,888
Why did you wake me?

407
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,858
You've been gone for hours.

408
00:26:55,892 --> 00:26:57,526
I was hungry.

409
00:26:57,561 --> 00:26:59,612
We're all hungry.

410
00:26:59,646 --> 00:27:01,363
I was just eating.

411
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:04,400
Summer was eating.

412
00:27:04,484 --> 00:27:07,403
Your body can't live on
the food your wolf consumes.

413
00:27:07,454 --> 00:27:10,573
<i>Spending too much time in
Summer's skin is dangerous.</i>

414
00:27:12,158 --> 00:27:13,959
You're not a direwolf, Bran.

415
00:27:16,997 --> 00:27:18,914
Must be glorious, though.

416
00:27:18,965 --> 00:27:22,635
To run, to leap, to hunt.

417
00:27:23,803 --> 00:27:25,654
To be whole.

418
00:27:25,689 --> 00:27:28,424
<i>I know that's tempting,</i>

419
00:27:28,475 --> 00:27:30,759
but if you're trapped
in Summer for too long,

420
00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:32,645
you'll forget what it was
to be human.

421
00:27:36,633 --> 00:27:38,767
You'd forget us, Bran.

422
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:40,686
You'd forget your mother
and father.

423
00:27:40,737 --> 00:27:42,738
You'd forget your brothers
and sisters.

424
00:27:42,772 --> 00:27:44,490
You'd forget Winterfell.

425
00:27:44,524 --> 00:27:46,442
You'd forget you.

426
00:27:46,444 --> 00:27:50,613
And if we lose you,
we lose everything.

427
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:56,418
<i>( wind blowing )</i>

428
00:28:04,511 --> 00:28:07,463
<i>( wolf barks )</i>

429
00:28:22,112 --> 00:28:25,314
Hodor, take me to the tree.

430
00:29:01,184 --> 00:29:03,318
( caws )

431
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,531
Voice:
<i>Look for me...</i>

432
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:19,535
( cawing )

433
00:29:20,954 --> 00:29:22,538
Voice:
<i>...beneath the tree.</i>

434
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:28,711
Cersei:<i> — He saw us.</i>
— ( screaming )

435
00:29:28,762 --> 00:29:31,764
<i>( dragon roaring )</i>

436
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:34,049
Voice:
<i>North.</i>

437
00:29:34,051 --> 00:29:36,218
( gasps )

438
00:29:43,443 --> 00:29:45,728
I know where we have to go.

439
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:48,480
<i>( bells tolling )</i>

440
00:30:33,276 --> 00:30:36,161
Let it be known
that Margaery of House Tyrell

441
00:30:36,196 --> 00:30:40,082
<i>and Joffrey of the Houses</i>
<i>Lannister and Baratheon</i>

442
00:30:40,116 --> 00:30:43,952
are one heart, one flesh,
one soul.

443
00:30:43,954 --> 00:30:46,622
<i>Cursed be he</i>

444
00:30:46,624 --> 00:30:49,875
<i>who would seek</i>
<i>to tear them asunder.</i>

445
00:30:51,961 --> 00:30:56,348
With this kiss,
I pledge my love.

446
00:30:59,803 --> 00:31:01,637
( applause )

447
00:31:17,704 --> 00:31:19,788
We have a new queen.

448
00:31:21,741 --> 00:31:23,709
Better her than you.

449
00:31:35,905 --> 00:31:38,841
— Bit much, wouldn't you say?
— It feels proportionate.

450
00:31:38,843 --> 00:31:42,010
— Proportionate to what?
— The expected extravagance.

451
00:31:42,095 --> 00:31:44,479
People who spend their money
on this sort of nonsense

452
00:31:44,514 --> 00:31:46,098
tend not to have it for long.

453
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:49,351
You ought to try enjoying
something before you die.

454
00:31:49,353 --> 00:31:50,936
You might find it suits you.

455
00:31:50,987 --> 00:31:54,606
Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin
and I are speaking.

456
00:31:54,657 --> 00:31:57,075
Anyway, I don't know what
you're complaining about.

457
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,493
I'm paying my share.

458
00:31:58,528 --> 00:32:00,829
Shall we stick golden roses
in half the meat pies

459
00:32:00,864 --> 00:32:02,531
to commemorate your generosity?

460
00:32:02,533 --> 00:32:06,034
No, your heartfelt thank-you
is its own reward.

461
00:32:06,036 --> 00:32:09,037
I would imagine I'd be hearing
it again before long.

462
00:32:09,072 --> 00:32:11,206
Wars are rather expensive.

463
00:32:11,257 --> 00:32:14,259
«The Iron Bank
will have its due.»

464
00:32:14,294 --> 00:32:17,045
How they love
to remind everyone.

465
00:32:17,047 --> 00:32:19,715
Almost as much as you
Lannisters with your debts.

466
00:32:19,766 --> 00:32:21,733
I'm not worried about
the Iron Bank.

467
00:32:21,768 --> 00:32:24,353
We both know
you're smarter than that.

468
00:32:24,387 --> 00:32:28,473
Come, Tywin, let us
celebrate young love.

469
00:32:29,943 --> 00:32:33,111
— <i> ( music playing )</i>
— ( people laughing, chatting )

470
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,204
All taken care of.

471
00:32:42,238 --> 00:32:45,157
— You saw her board the ship?
— Aye, she's on it.

472
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:47,075
You saw the ship sail away?

473
00:32:47,077 --> 00:32:50,746
No one knows she's there
but you, me, and Varys.

474
00:32:50,748 --> 00:32:52,664
How do you know?

475
00:32:52,715 --> 00:32:55,250
Because if someone follows
me without an invitation,

476
00:32:55,252 --> 00:32:57,002
I'm the last person
they ever follow.

477
00:32:57,053 --> 00:32:59,137
There's someone following you?

478
00:33:00,924 --> 00:33:02,557
She's gone.

479
00:33:02,592 --> 00:33:04,927
I know you don't want to
believe it, but she is.

480
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:08,263
Now, go drink till it feels
like you did the right thing.

481
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,488
Hello.

482
00:33:16,522 --> 00:33:19,024
— Hello.
— Not you.

483
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:37,292
You look exquisite, child.

484
00:33:37,343 --> 00:33:40,629
The wind has been
at you, though.

485
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,799
I haven't had the
opportunity to tell you

486
00:33:43,801 --> 00:33:46,601
how sorry I was to hear
about your brother.

487
00:33:46,636 --> 00:33:50,138
War is war, but killing
a man at a wedding,

488
00:33:50,189 --> 00:33:51,773
horrid.

489
00:33:51,808 --> 00:33:54,026
What sort of monster
would do such a thing?

490
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:57,529
As if men need more
reasons to fear marriage.

491
00:33:57,563 --> 00:33:59,064
My lady.
My lady.

492
00:33:59,115 --> 00:34:02,367
Lord Tyrion, you see?
Not as bad as all that.

493
00:34:02,402 --> 00:34:04,069
Perhaps if your pauper husband

494
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,655
were to sell his mule
and his last pair of shoes,

495
00:34:06,657 --> 00:34:09,992
he might be able to afford to bring
you to Highgarden for a visit.

496
00:34:09,994 --> 00:34:13,045
Now that peace has come and
all is right with the world,

497
00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:15,163
it would do you good
to see some of it.

498
00:34:15,165 --> 00:34:18,166
You must excuse me.
It's time I ate

499
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:20,302
some of this food I paid for.

506
00:34:57,123 --> 00:34:59,841
My love, why don't we
make the announcement?

( taps goblet )

508
00:35:02,379 --> 00:35:03,962
Everyone.

509
00:35:04,013 --> 00:35:07,799
The queen would like
to say a few words.

510
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:11,219
( applause )

511
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:17,192
We are so fortunate

512
00:35:17,226 --> 00:35:19,444
to enjoy this marvelous
food and drink.

513
00:35:19,479 --> 00:35:21,980
Not all among us are so lucky.

514
00:35:22,031 --> 00:35:25,951
To thank the gods for bringing
the recent war to a just end,

515
00:35:25,985 --> 00:35:29,287
King Joffrey has decreed
that the leftovers

516
00:35:29,322 --> 00:35:33,041
from our feast be given
to the poorest in his city.

517
00:35:33,076 --> 00:35:36,294
— ( applause )
— <i> ( music playing )</i>

518
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,922
You're an example to us all.

519
00:36:03,189 --> 00:36:05,190
Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry.

520
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:06,908
Ser Loras, it's quite all right.

521
00:36:09,695 --> 00:36:11,613
Your sister looks
very beautiful.

522
00:36:11,664 --> 00:36:13,198
Loras:
<i>As does yours.</i>

523
00:36:13,249 --> 00:36:16,284
So, looking forward
to your wedding?

524
00:36:16,335 --> 00:36:18,670
Yes, very much.

525
00:36:18,704 --> 00:36:21,089
Our fathers are both
rather keen on the prospect.

526
00:36:21,124 --> 00:36:22,624
They certainly are.

527
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:23,925
Perhaps they should get married.

528
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,094
( laughs )

529
00:36:26,129 --> 00:36:28,547
If you were to marry Cersei,

530
00:36:28,598 --> 00:36:30,182
she'd murder you in your sleep.

531
00:36:30,216 --> 00:36:33,935
If you somehow managed
to put a child in her first,

532
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,104
she'd murder him, too,

533
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:37,806
long before he drew
his first breath.

534
00:36:37,857 --> 00:36:40,976
Luckily for you,
none of this will happen

535
00:36:40,978 --> 00:36:43,612
because you'll never marry her.

536
00:36:46,482 --> 00:36:48,567
And neither will you.

537
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:04,249
Your Grace.
My king.

538
00:37:04,283 --> 00:37:06,168
— My queen.
— Lady Brienne.

539
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,470
So good of you to come.

540
00:37:08,504 --> 00:37:09,921
I'm no lady, Your Grace.

541
00:37:09,972 --> 00:37:12,340
Did you just bow?

542
00:37:12,391 --> 00:37:13,842
Apologies, Your Grace.

543
00:37:13,893 --> 00:37:16,645
I never did master the curtsy.

544
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:18,263
You're the one who put a sword
through Renly Baratheon.

545
00:37:18,314 --> 00:37:21,266
That's not true, my love. Brienne
had nothing to do with it.

546
00:37:21,317 --> 00:37:23,018
A shame.

547
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,687
I'd knight the man that put an
end to that deviant's life.

548
00:37:26,856 --> 00:37:28,990
I just wanted
to congratulate you both

549
00:37:29,025 --> 00:37:30,375
and wish you good fortune.

550
00:37:30,409 --> 00:37:32,327
The country has been
at war too long.

551
00:37:32,361 --> 00:37:35,580
I hope your reign
is long and peaceful.

552
00:37:35,615 --> 00:37:37,432
— Yes, yes.
— Thank you.

553
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:39,651
I hope we see more of you.

554
00:37:46,459 --> 00:37:48,510
Lady Brienne.

555
00:37:48,544 --> 00:37:51,379
You're Lord Selwyn
Tarth's daughter.

556
00:37:51,381 --> 00:37:54,382
That makes you a lady whether
you want to be or not.

557
00:37:54,384 --> 00:37:56,685
As you say, Your Grace.

558
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:58,136
I owe you my gratitude.

559
00:37:58,187 --> 00:38:00,472
You returned my brother
safely to King's Landing.

560
00:38:02,942 --> 00:38:05,310
In truth, he rescued me,
Your Grace.

561
00:38:05,361 --> 00:38:07,078
More than once.

562
00:38:07,113 --> 00:38:09,231
Did he?

563
00:38:10,283 --> 00:38:11,900
Haven't heard that story before.

564
00:38:13,486 --> 00:38:16,071
Not such a fascinating
story, I'm afraid.

565
00:38:16,122 --> 00:38:18,490
I'm sure you have many
fascinating stories.

566
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:22,644
Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to
Catelyn Stark. And now my brother.

567
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:26,164
Must be exciting to flit
from one camp to the next

568
00:38:26,215 --> 00:38:28,967
serving whichever lord
or lady you fancy.

569
00:38:29,001 --> 00:38:31,553
I don't serve
your brother, Your Grace.

570
00:38:31,587 --> 00:38:33,722
But you love him.

571
00:38:41,764 --> 00:38:43,682
Your Grace.

572
00:38:54,243 --> 00:38:58,280
No, no, come to my chambers and
I will examine you personally.

573
00:38:58,282 --> 00:39:00,582
— She'll do no such thing.
— Oh, Your Grace.

574
00:39:00,616 --> 00:39:02,784
Yes, well, this young
lady sought my advice–

575
00:39:02,786 --> 00:39:04,502
You should see Qyburn.
He's quite good.

576
00:39:04,537 --> 00:39:07,622
— Your Grace.
— Qyburn? Deplorable man.

577
00:39:07,673 --> 00:39:11,092
Brought shame on the Citadel
with his repugnant experiments.

578
00:39:11,127 --> 00:39:13,461
More repugnant than your gnarled
fingers on that girl's thighs?

579
00:39:13,463 --> 00:39:15,847
Your Grace,
I am a man of learning.

580
00:39:15,881 --> 00:39:18,683
My little brother had you sent to the
Black Cells when you annoyed him.

581
00:39:18,718 --> 00:39:20,802
What do you think I could do
to you if you annoyed me?

582
00:39:20,804 --> 00:39:22,804
I never meant to annoy anyone.

583
00:39:22,806 --> 00:39:25,724
But you are.
You annoy me right now.

584
00:39:25,775 --> 00:39:27,942
Every breath you draw
in my presence annoys me.

585
00:39:27,977 --> 00:39:29,477
So here's what I want you to do.

586
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:31,029
I want you to leave my presence.

587
00:39:31,063 --> 00:39:32,480
Leave this wedding right now.

588
00:39:32,531 --> 00:39:34,149
Go to the kitchens
and instruct them

589
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,652
that all the leftovers from the feast
will be brought to the kennels.

590
00:39:37,654 --> 00:39:39,904
Your Grace,
Queen Margaery–

591
00:39:39,955 --> 00:39:42,290
The<i> queen</i> is telling you

592
00:39:42,325 --> 00:39:44,576
the leftovers will feed the dogs

593
00:39:44,627 --> 00:39:46,828
or you will.

594
00:40:05,681 --> 00:40:08,683
A gold dragon to whoever
knocks my fool's hat off.

595
00:40:08,734 --> 00:40:10,985
( crowd laughing )

596
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:22,530
You're in rather a good mood.

597
00:40:22,532 --> 00:40:24,866
— I suppose I am.
— I won't ask why.

598
00:40:24,868 --> 00:40:28,086
— Small pleasures.
— Your Grace. Lord Tywin.

599
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,671
Prince Oberyn.

600
00:40:29,705 --> 00:40:31,039
I don't believe you
have met Ellaria.

601
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:32,791
This is the Lord Hand
Tywin Lannister

602
00:40:32,842 --> 00:40:35,210
and Cersei Lannister
the Queen Regent.

603
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:37,962
I suppose it is
former Queen Regent now.

604
00:40:38,013 --> 00:40:41,383
Lord Hand and Lady Cersei,

605
00:40:41,434 --> 00:40:45,470
— Ellaria Sand.
— My lord. My lady.

606
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:47,222
Charmed.

607
00:40:47,273 --> 00:40:49,441
Can't say I've ever
met a Sand before.

608
00:40:53,312 --> 00:40:54,813
We are everywhere in Dorne.

609
00:40:54,897 --> 00:40:57,198
I have 10,000 brothers
and sisters.

610
00:40:57,233 --> 00:40:59,651
Bastards are born
of passion, aren't they?

611
00:40:59,702 --> 00:41:01,069
We don't despise them in Dorne.

612
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,320
No?
How tolerant of you.

613
00:41:02,371 --> 00:41:04,406
I expect it is a relief,
Lady Cersei,

614
00:41:04,408 --> 00:41:07,125
giving up your regal
responsibilities.

615
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:10,295
Wearing the crown for so many years
must have left your neck a bit crooked.

616
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:12,330
I suppose you'll never
know, Prince Oberyn.

617
00:41:12,381 --> 00:41:14,299
It's a shame your older brother
couldn't attend the wedding.

618
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:16,668
Please give him our regards.

619
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:18,420
With any luck,
the gout will abate

620
00:41:18,471 --> 00:41:20,088
with time and he will
be able to walk again.

621
00:41:20,139 --> 00:41:22,056
They call it
the rich man's disease.

622
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:23,425
A wonder you don't have it.

623
00:41:23,476 --> 00:41:25,343
Noblemen in my part
of the country

624
00:41:25,394 --> 00:41:28,463
don't enjoy the same lifestyle
as our counterparts in Dorne.

625
00:41:28,497 --> 00:41:30,348
People everywhere
have their differences.

626
00:41:30,399 --> 00:41:33,601
In some places the highborn
frown upon those of low birth.

627
00:41:33,603 --> 00:41:36,938
In other places the rape and
murder of women and children

628
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,907
is considered distasteful.

629
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,162
What a fortunate thing for
you, former Queen Regent,

630
00:41:44,196 --> 00:41:46,164
that your daughter
Myrcella has been sent

631
00:41:46,198 --> 00:41:48,533
to live in the latter
sort of place.

632
00:41:50,302 --> 00:41:51,836
<i>( taps goblet )</i>

633
00:41:51,871 --> 00:41:55,673
Everyone, silence!
Clear the floor.

634
00:41:58,043 --> 00:42:01,796
There's been too much
amusement here today.

635
00:42:01,847 --> 00:42:05,683
A royal wedding
is not an amusement.

636
00:42:05,718 --> 00:42:08,686
A royal wedding is history.

637
00:42:08,721 --> 00:42:11,222
The time has come for all of us

638
00:42:11,273 --> 00:42:13,691
to contemplate our history.

639
00:42:14,693 --> 00:42:16,060
My lords...

640
00:42:18,647 --> 00:42:20,448
my ladies...

641
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,768
I give you

642
00:42:23,803 --> 00:42:26,287
— King Joffrey...
— ( shouting )

643
00:42:26,322 --> 00:42:28,790
<i>...Renly, Stannis,</i>

644
00:42:28,824 --> 00:42:32,210
<i>Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy.</i>

645
00:42:32,244 --> 00:42:35,547
The War of the Five Kings.

646
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:37,966
<i>( applause, laughter )</i>

647
00:42:38,918 --> 00:42:41,052
I'm the rightful king.

648
00:42:42,221 --> 00:42:45,006
— King in the North!
— Yes!

649
00:42:49,144 --> 00:42:52,146
— <i> Traitor. You're a traitor.</i>
— ( laughing )

650
00:42:52,181 --> 00:42:55,433
<i>For the Seven Kingdoms!</i>

651
00:42:59,188 --> 00:43:01,322
Let the war begin.

652
00:43:01,357 --> 00:43:03,608
— ( laughing )
— ( howls )

653
00:43:03,659 --> 00:43:06,361
Renly, you're no king.

654
00:43:06,363 --> 00:43:09,614
Away, degenerate.
Away. Away.

655
00:43:09,665 --> 00:43:12,283
Ooh, careful.
( squeals )

656
00:43:12,334 --> 00:43:14,836
— Go on.
— I want you to be my prince.

657
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:17,872
( laughing )

658
00:43:22,795 --> 00:43:24,345
Stannis!

659
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,814
Who's got the gold now, Stark?

660
00:43:26,849 --> 00:43:30,184
I am the rightful king.
Challenge me, ruffian.

661
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:32,020
— Take that.
— I'm drowning. I'm drowning.

662
00:43:32,054 --> 00:43:34,472
I am the King in the North!

663
00:43:38,644 --> 00:43:40,645
Not wildfire!

664
00:43:42,698 --> 00:43:44,549
— ( laughing )
— ( crying )

665
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,872
Pay each of them 20 gold
when this is done.

666
00:43:50,906 --> 00:43:52,907
Podrick:
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

667
00:43:52,909 --> 00:43:55,159
We'll have to find another
way to thank the king.

668
00:43:59,415 --> 00:44:01,332
Charge!

669
00:44:06,055 --> 00:44:08,556
Ready, again.

670
00:44:12,311 --> 00:44:14,145
I am the King in the North!

671
00:44:15,931 --> 00:44:17,732
— Charge!
— Charge!

672
00:44:17,766 --> 00:44:19,601
— Yes!
— <i> ( crowd cheers )</i>

673
00:44:19,652 --> 00:44:22,937
— <i> Your head!</i>

676
00:44:51,283 --> 00:44:53,718
( laughing )

677
00:44:57,439 --> 00:45:00,308
Fine gentlemen.

678
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:02,644
( applause )

679
00:45:08,617 --> 00:45:11,069
Well fought.
Well fought.

680
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,988
Here you are.
Champion's purse.

681
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:19,577
Though you're not
the champion yet, are you?

682
00:45:19,628 --> 00:45:23,214
A true champion defeats
all the challengers.

683
00:45:23,248 --> 00:45:25,633
Surely there are
others out there

684
00:45:25,668 --> 00:45:28,252
who still dare
to challenge my reign.

685
00:45:28,303 --> 00:45:30,338
Uncle.

686
00:45:30,389 --> 00:45:33,641
How about you? I'm sure
they have a spare costume.

687
00:45:33,676 --> 00:45:36,094
<i>( crowd laughs )</i>

688
00:45:39,682 --> 00:45:42,734
One taste of combat was
enough for me, Your Grace.

689
00:45:42,768 --> 00:45:45,353
I would like to keep
what remains of my face.

690
00:45:45,404 --> 00:45:47,855
<i>I think you should fight him.</i>

691
00:45:47,857 --> 00:45:49,691
This was but a poor imitation

692
00:45:49,693 --> 00:45:51,659
of your own bravery
on the field of battle.

693
00:45:51,694 --> 00:45:54,195
I speak as a firsthand witness.

694
00:45:54,229 --> 00:45:56,247
<i>Climb down from the high table</i>

695
00:45:56,281 --> 00:45:58,366
<i>with your new Valyrian sword</i>

696
00:45:58,368 --> 00:46:01,536
and show everyone how
a true king wins his throne.

697
00:46:01,587 --> 00:46:03,921
<i>Be careful, though.</i>

698
00:46:03,956 --> 00:46:07,008
This one is clearly
mad with lust.

699
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:10,878
It would be a tragedy for
the king to lose his virtue

700
00:46:10,929 --> 00:46:12,964
hours before his wedding night.

701
00:46:13,015 --> 00:46:15,850
<i>( light laughter )</i>

702
00:46:43,662 --> 00:46:45,496
A fine vintage.

703
00:46:45,547 --> 00:46:47,248
Shame that it spilled.

704
00:46:47,299 --> 00:46:49,217
It did not spill.

705
00:46:49,251 --> 00:46:51,502
My love, come back to me.

706
00:46:51,553 --> 00:46:53,304
It's time for my father's toast.

707
00:46:53,338 --> 00:46:55,056
( applause )

708
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:57,925
Well, how does he expect me
to toast without wine?

709
00:46:59,995 --> 00:47:04,482
Uncle, you can be my cupbearer

710
00:47:04,516 --> 00:47:06,768
seeing as you're
too cowardly to fight.

711
00:47:06,819 --> 00:47:09,020
Your Grace does me
a great honor.

712
00:47:09,071 --> 00:47:12,440
It's not meant as an honor.

713
00:47:43,772 --> 00:47:45,306
Bring me my goblet.

714
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,248
What good is an empty cup?

715
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:12,800
Fill it.

716
00:48:26,732 --> 00:48:27,932
Kneel.

717
00:48:30,269 --> 00:48:32,687
Kneel before your king.

718
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,076
Kneel.

719
00:48:45,367 --> 00:48:48,035
I said...

720
00:48:48,086 --> 00:48:49,954
kneel!

721
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:54,942
Look, the pie.

722
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:56,711
<i>( applause )</i>

723
00:49:09,474 --> 00:49:10,892
My queen.

00:49:18,734 --> 00:49:22,320
— ( gasps )
— ( applause )

725
00:49:22,371 --> 00:49:24,872
Margaery:
Wonderful.

726
00:49:26,241 --> 00:49:29,143
Wonderful.

727
00:49:29,177 --> 00:49:31,045
<i>My hero.</i>

728
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:37,301
— Can we leave now?
— Let's find out.

729
00:49:45,928 --> 00:49:47,144
Uncle.

730
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:52,099
Where are you going?

731
00:49:52,101 --> 00:49:54,652
<i>You're my cupbearer, remember?</i>

732
00:49:54,686 --> 00:49:57,271
I thought I might change out of
these wet clothes, Your Grace.

733
00:49:57,273 --> 00:49:59,941
No, no, no. No, you're
perfect the way you are.

734
00:50:01,109 --> 00:50:03,361
Serve me my wine.

735
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:11,335
Well, hurry up.
This pie is dry.

736
00:50:19,294 --> 00:50:21,128
Mm, good.

737
00:50:21,179 --> 00:50:23,547
<i>Needs washing down.</i>

738
00:50:23,598 --> 00:50:26,133
If it please Your Grace,
Lady Sansa is very tired.

739
00:50:26,135 --> 00:50:28,886
<i>No.</i>
<i>( coughs )</i>

740
00:50:28,937 --> 00:50:30,638
No, you'll wait here...

741

— Your Grace?

744
00:50:40,065 --> 00:50:42,700
( coughing )
It's nothing.

745
00:50:43,986 --> 00:50:47,071
( gasping )

746
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,825
— He's choking!
— Help the poor boy.

747
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:54,378
( gasping )

748
00:50:54,413 --> 00:50:57,298
— Idiots, help your king.
— Move away!

00:50:59,335 --> 00:51:02,253

Cersei: — Help him!

— Someone help him!
— Joffrey!

( gagging )

753
00:51:06,475 --> 00:51:09,226
— Come with me now.
Cersei:<i> — Joffrey! Joffrey!</i>

754
00:51:09,261 --> 00:51:11,479
If you want to live,
we have to leave.

755
00:51:11,513 --> 00:51:12,813
Don't touch him!

756
00:51:12,848 --> 00:51:15,566
( gurgling )

757
00:51:18,937 --> 00:51:20,855
— Joffrey.

758
00:51:20,857 --> 00:51:23,357
Please, Joffrey.

759
00:51:23,392 --> 00:51:26,944
Joffrey, what is it?

760
00:51:26,995 --> 00:51:29,413
Help him!

762
00:52:01,696 --> 00:52:04,148

My son.

Man:<i> He's gone.</i>
<i>Our king is gone.</i>

765
00:52:14,576 --> 00:52:15,960
He did this.

766
00:52:18,497 --> 00:52:21,067
He poisoned my son,

767
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,417
your king.

768
00:52:23,419 --> 00:52:26,087
