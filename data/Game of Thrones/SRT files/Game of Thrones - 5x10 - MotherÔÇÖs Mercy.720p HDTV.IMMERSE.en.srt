2
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,140
<i>Brace the wind.</i>

3
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:09,712
The Lord of Light has made
good on his promise, my king.

4
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:12,548
His fires have melted
the snows away.

5
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,133
The way ahead is clear.

6
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:15,768
We ride for Winterfell.

7
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:17,219
And you will take it.

8
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:22,224
The Lord has shown me
Bolton banners burning.

9
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:24,894
You will receive
what is yours by right.

10
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,666
Your Grace.

11
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:49,218
Prepare to form up.

12
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:51,003
Your Grace.

13
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:55,641
Tell me.

14
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:59,345
The men, many deserted
before dawn.

15
00:05:01,898 --> 00:05:03,516
<i>How many?</i>

16
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,601
<i>Nearly half.</i>

17
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:08,521
All the sellswords
with all the horses.

18
00:05:19,282 --> 00:05:21,417
Your Grace.

19
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,789
Speak up. Can't be
worse than mutiny.

20
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:59,238
Cut her down.

21
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:14,253
<i>Your Grace.</i>

22
00:06:14,255 --> 00:06:17,256
The Lady Melisandre was just
seen riding out of camp.

23
00:06:29,486 --> 00:06:31,604
Get the men
into marching formation.

24
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:35,608
On to Winterfell.

25
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:43,249
He raised his hands

26
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:45,584
and they all stood up at once.

27
00:06:48,288 --> 00:06:51,941
Tens of thousands of them.
The biggest army in the world.

28
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:53,626
So what are you gonna do?

29
00:06:56,513 --> 00:06:59,682
I'm gonna hope they don't
learn how to climb the Wall.

30
00:06:59,716 --> 00:07:02,468
But the dragonglass...

31
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:05,304
No one's ever
getting that back now.

32
00:07:05,355 --> 00:07:07,957
<i>It wouldn't have</i>
<i>mattered anyway.</i>

33
00:07:07,991 --> 00:07:09,441
<i>Not unless we had</i>
<i>a mountain of it.</i>

34
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:12,111
But you killed a white walker.

35
00:07:12,145 --> 00:07:13,746
<i>With Longclaw.</i>

36
00:07:15,315 --> 00:07:17,483
I saw them shatter steel
axes like they were glass.

37
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:20,486
- But Longclaw...
<i>-  Is Valyrian steel.</i>

38
00:07:20,537 --> 00:07:23,105
How many Valyrian steel swords
are left in the Seven Kingdoms?

39
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:24,957
Not enough.

40
00:07:27,611 --> 00:07:28,994
The first Lord Commander
in history

41
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:31,463
to sacrifice the lives
of sworn brothers

42
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:33,582
to save the lives of wildlings.

43
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,222
How's it feel to be friends with the
most hated man in Castle Black?

44
00:07:40,257 --> 00:07:42,308
<i>You were friends with me</i>
<i>when I first came here.</i>

45
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:44,426
And I wasn't winning
any elections back then.

46
00:07:44,477 --> 00:07:47,513
Here's to us, then.

47
00:07:47,515 --> 00:07:49,231
Long may they sneer.

48
00:07:57,657 --> 00:07:59,441
What?

49
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:03,629
I wanted to ask you something.

50
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:07,199
To ask something of you.

51
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,005
Send me, Gilly,
and the baby to Oldtown

52
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,207
so I can become a maester.

53
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:18,010
That's what I'm meant to be.
Not this.

54
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:21,263
I need you here, Sam.

55
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:23,716
If you leave, who's left
to give me advice I trust?

56
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:27,186
Well, there's Edd.

57
00:08:30,023 --> 00:08:32,524
I'd be more use
to you as a maester.

58
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,528
More use to everyone now
that Maester Aemon is gone.

59
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:39,365
The Citadel has the
world's greatest library.

60
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,568
I'll learn about history,

61
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:45,104
strategy, healing.

62
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:46,805
And other things,

63
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,742
things that will
help when--

64
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:51,410
when they come.

65
00:08:54,414 --> 00:08:57,116
If Gilly stays here,
then she'll die.

66
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:01,954
And the baby that she
named after me will die.

67
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:05,224
And I'll end up dying, too,
trying to protect them.

68
00:09:07,427 --> 00:09:10,179
Which means that the last thing
that I'll see in this world

69
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:13,182
will be the look in her
eyes when I fail them.

70
00:09:17,937 --> 00:09:21,106
And I'd rather see a thousand
white walkers than see that.

71
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:37,673
Thank you.

72
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:41,343
You know that the Citadel will
make you swear off women, too.

73
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:43,629
Oh, they'll bloody try.

74
00:09:47,384 --> 00:09:49,735
- Sam.
- What?

75
00:09:51,354 --> 00:09:53,338
Sam.

76
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:57,142
You had just been beaten half to death.
How did you--

77
00:09:57,193 --> 00:09:59,812
Oh, very carefully.

78
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:02,948
I'm glad the end of the world's

79
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:04,716
working out well for someone.

80
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:11,590
I'll come back.

81
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:15,043
To your return.

82
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:17,713
To my return.

83
00:11:56,262 --> 00:11:59,598
<i>Aye, this way.</i>

84
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:35,634
<i>My lady!</i>

85
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:39,388
Stannis.

86
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:41,557
Stannis Baratheon is coming.
His whole army.

87
00:12:41,608 --> 00:12:43,025
How do you know it's Stannis?

88
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:44,977
They're carrying his
flaming heart banners.

89
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:48,564
From the Blackwater.
I'll never forget it.

90
00:13:25,818 --> 00:13:27,436
Trench here.

91
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:29,688
Another one 300 yards
from the castle wall.

92
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,907
Hurry them along.

93
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:33,442
- Right, Curlew.
- Yes, sir.

94
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:34,693
<i>Dig between those two rises.</i>

95
00:13:34,695 --> 00:13:36,628
- Spread out.
<i>-  I'm with you.</i>

96
00:13:36,663 --> 00:13:38,864
<i>- Archers!</i>
<i>- Spread out!</i>

97
00:13:38,915 --> 00:13:41,500
And send out a foraging
party immediately.

98
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:43,835
Siege begins at sunrise.

99
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,288
There's not going to be
a siege, Your Grace.

100
00:14:27,747 --> 00:14:30,465
<i>We've got no chance!</i>

101
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:42,404
<i> No, please, please.</i>

102
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:37,959
Bolton has women
fighting for him?

103
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:41,279
I don't fight for the Boltons.

104
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:44,649
I'm Brienne of Tarth.

105
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:49,588
I was Kingsguard
to Renly Baratheon.

106
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:59,431
I was there when he was murdered
by a shadow with your face.

107
00:17:02,268 --> 00:17:05,637
<i>You murdered him</i>
<i>with blood magic?</i>

108
00:17:11,143 --> 00:17:12,944
I did.

109
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:24,389
In the name of Renly
of House Baratheon,

110
00:17:24,423 --> 00:17:26,124
First of His Name,

111
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:29,144
rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,

112
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:32,430
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm,

113
00:17:32,432 --> 00:17:36,535
I, Brienne of Tarth,
sentence you to die.

114
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:44,943
Do you have any last words?

115
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:56,288
Go on, do your duty.

116
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:16,441
Looks like we're done here.

117
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:35,293
I surrender!
I surrender!

118
00:18:35,328 --> 00:18:37,329
And I accept your surrender.

119
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:51,009
Let's head back.

120
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,345
My wife must be lonely.

121
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:28,129
My lady.

122
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,432
I've come to escort you
back to your chamber.

123
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:33,018
Go with her, please.

124
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:39,724
I know what Ramsay is.

125
00:19:39,775 --> 00:19:41,977
I know what he'll do to me.

126
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,232
If I'm going to die,

127
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:50,785
let it happen while there's
still some of me left.

128
00:19:52,822 --> 00:19:54,489
Die?

129
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,975
Who said anything about dying?

130
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:58,677
You can't die.

131
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:00,445
Your father was
Warden of the North.

132
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:02,414
Ramsay needs you.

133
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,886
Though I suppose he
doesn't need all of you.

134
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,588
Just the parts he'll use
to make his heir,

135
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,758
until you've given him a boy or
two and he's finished using them.

136
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:20,398
Then he's got incredible
plans for those parts.

137
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:23,601
So, shall we wait
for him to come back

138
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:25,603
or should we begin now?

139
00:20:27,606 --> 00:20:29,824
You're leaving it to me?

140
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:31,493
Good.

141
00:20:31,527 --> 00:20:33,278
Let's begin.

142
00:20:35,614 --> 00:20:37,782
Reek-- stop!

143
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,701
Stop!

144
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:49,461
<i> Open the gate!</i>

145
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,520
He's coming back.

146
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:37,202
I can see I have
my work cut out for me.

147
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:39,454
You two, out.

148
00:23:33,842 --> 00:23:37,595
You were the first person
on my list, you know.

149
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,632
For killing Syrio Forel.
Remember him?

150
00:23:40,683 --> 00:23:42,967
Probably not.

151
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,139
I've gotten a few of the others.

152
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:51,309
The Many-Faced God stole
a few more from me.

153
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,895
But I'm glad he left me you.

154
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,567
Do you know who I am?

155
00:24:03,739 --> 00:24:06,040
I can't hear you.

156
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,751
You know who I am.

157
00:24:16,802 --> 00:24:18,836
I'm Arya Stark.

158
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,431
Do you know who you are?

159
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:34,602
You're no one.

160
00:24:35,654 --> 00:24:37,739
You're nothing.

161
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:23,618
A girl has taken a life.

162
00:25:23,652 --> 00:25:26,120
The wrong life.

163
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:29,957
I was right about her.

164
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:31,409
You were.

165
00:25:33,128 --> 00:25:35,246
You're not ready.

166
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:38,633
Not at all.

167
00:25:42,054 --> 00:25:44,839
That man's life
was not yours to take.

168
00:25:46,358 --> 00:25:48,426
A girl stole from
the Many-Faced God.

169
00:25:50,145 --> 00:25:52,347
Now a debt is owed.

170
00:25:58,437 --> 00:26:00,271
Only death can pay for life.

171
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:15,753
No! No!

172
00:26:15,788 --> 00:26:19,207
No, you-- don't die!
Don't die!

173
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,564
Why are you crying?

174
00:26:28,067 --> 00:26:29,767
He was my friend.

175
00:26:29,802 --> 00:26:32,537
No, he wasn't.
Didn't you listen to him?

176
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:35,857
<i>He was no one.</i>

177
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,112
But if you're--

178
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:45,083
who's this?

179
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,051
<i>No one at all.</i>

180
00:26:47,086 --> 00:26:50,788
Just as a girl should have been
before she took a face from the hall.

181
00:26:56,912 --> 00:26:59,597
<i>The faces are for no one.</i>

182
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:01,165
You are still someone.

183
00:27:04,219 --> 00:27:06,637
And to someone,

184
00:27:06,672 --> 00:27:08,172
the faces are as good as poison.

185
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,037
I can't see.

186
00:27:29,027 --> 00:27:31,829
What's happening?

187
00:27:31,864 --> 00:27:33,948
What's happening?!

188
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,878
<i>- I wish you a safe journey home.</i>
- Thank you.

189
00:27:51,967 --> 00:27:54,435
Forgive me, child.

190
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:58,306
I wish you all the
happiness in the world.

191
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:17,825
Maybe I'll come
visit you sometime.

192
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:19,794
Maybe I'll come visit you.

193
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:21,462
Don't wait too long.

194
00:28:21,497 --> 00:28:23,214
Got a noblewoman
to marry back home.

195
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:25,917
You want a good girl,

196
00:28:25,968 --> 00:28:28,252
but you need the bad pussy.

197
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,591
<i>Whenever you're
ready, my lord.</i>

198
00:28:49,274 --> 00:28:51,659
Try not to lose it this time.

199
00:28:53,662 --> 00:28:56,531
I'll never take it off again.

200
00:28:56,582 --> 00:28:59,584
I know you didn't
want to leave Dorne,

201
00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:01,786
but I'm glad you're coming home.

202
00:29:01,788 --> 00:29:03,538
Your mother's desperate
to see you.

203
00:29:03,589 --> 00:29:05,957
I'm glad Trystane
is coming with us.

204
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:07,792
He seems like a nice boy.

205
00:29:07,794 --> 00:29:09,594
You're lucky.

206
00:29:09,628 --> 00:29:12,964
Arranged marriages
are rarely so--

207
00:29:12,966 --> 00:29:15,132
so well arranged.

208
00:29:15,217 --> 00:29:16,934
Do you think Mother
will like him?

209
00:29:18,387 --> 00:29:21,806
If she sees you're happy,
I'm sure she will.

210
00:29:21,808 --> 00:29:23,169
You really believe that?

211
00:29:23,191 --> 00:29:25,977
Have you ever known
your mother to like anyone

212
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:28,312
aside from her children?

213
00:29:28,363 --> 00:29:30,147
She likes you.

214
00:29:30,198 --> 00:29:33,067
I'm not so sure about that.

215
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:34,652
Listen...

216
00:29:36,655 --> 00:29:38,956
there's something
I wanted to tell you.

217
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:43,461
Something I should
have told you long ago.

218
00:29:43,495 --> 00:29:45,329
So...

219
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:50,217
now that you've seen
more of the world,

220
00:29:50,252 --> 00:29:53,921
you've learned how
complicated things can be,

221
00:29:53,972 --> 00:29:56,073
people can be.

222
00:29:56,108 --> 00:29:59,343
The Lannisters and the Martells
have hated each other for years,

223
00:29:59,394 --> 00:30:01,646
but you've fallen
in love with Trystane.

224
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,398
It was an accident, really.
I mean, what were the chances?

225
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:06,233
You happen to fall
in love with the man

226
00:30:06,268 --> 00:30:08,352
you were assigned to marry?

227
00:30:08,403 --> 00:30:10,154
My point is...

228
00:30:12,357 --> 00:30:15,359
we don't choose whom we love.

229
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,695
It just, well--

230
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:22,333
it's beyond our control.

231
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:24,251
- I sound like an idiot.
- No, you don't.

232
00:30:24,286 --> 00:30:26,837
What I'm trying to say--
what I'm trying

233
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:28,172
and failing to say--

234
00:30:28,206 --> 00:30:29,590
I know what
you're trying to say.

235
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:32,009
No, I'm afraid you don't.

236
00:30:32,044 --> 00:30:33,711
I do.

237
00:30:36,932 --> 00:30:39,550
I know.

238
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:41,185
About you and Mother.

239
00:30:43,605 --> 00:30:45,973
I think a part of me
always knew.

240
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:50,728
And I'm glad.

241
00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:56,367
I'm glad that you're my father.

242
00:31:31,236 --> 00:31:33,154
Myrcella?

243
00:31:35,441 --> 00:31:37,775
Myrcella?

244
00:31:44,116 --> 00:31:47,034
Myrcella?
Myrcella?

245
00:33:05,197 --> 00:33:07,364
You love her, don't you?

246
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:13,537
How could you not?

247
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:17,007
Of course it's hopeless
for the both of you.

248
00:33:17,042 --> 00:33:20,544
A sellsword from the fighting
pits, a disgraced knight.

249
00:33:20,595 --> 00:33:22,713
Neither one of you is fit
consort for a queen.

250
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:29,019
But we always want
the wrong woman.

251
00:33:29,054 --> 00:33:31,138
Does he always talk so much?

252
00:33:33,975 --> 00:33:36,227
Jorah the Andal.

253
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:38,445
Torgo Nudho.

254
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,980
He should not be here.

255
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:41,365
No, but he is.

256
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:44,068
Our queen ordered him
exiled from city.

257
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:46,370
Our queen would be dead
if not for him.

258
00:33:46,404 --> 00:33:50,929
_

259
00:33:53,973 --> 00:33:55,293
_

260
00:33:55,413 --> 00:33:57,214
_

261
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:01,621
_

262
00:34:01,741 --> 00:34:05,463
_

263
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:08,774
_

264
00:34:08,894 --> 00:34:11,645
<i>Puñila.</i>
Thank you.

265
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,431
I am sorry.

266
00:34:14,482 --> 00:34:16,934
Sorry I not there
to fight for our queen.

267
00:34:16,985 --> 00:34:18,482
You missed a good scrap.

268
00:34:18,602 --> 00:34:19,987
None of that matters now.

269
00:34:20,071 --> 00:34:21,438
The longer we sit
here bantering,

270
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,024
the longer Daenerys is out
there in the wilderness.

271
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:26,443
He's right.
The dragon headed north.

272
00:34:26,445 --> 00:34:28,495
If we're going to find her,
that's where we'll have to go.

273
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,613
We?

274
00:34:29,615 --> 00:34:31,532
You're a Lannister.

275
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:34,501
The queen intends to remove
your family from power.

276
00:34:34,536 --> 00:34:36,253
And I intend to help her do it.

277
00:34:36,288 --> 00:34:38,463
You've been here
for how many days now?

278
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:40,457
I've fought for her for years.

279
00:34:40,508 --> 00:34:42,092
Since she was little
more than a child.

280
00:34:42,127 --> 00:34:44,378
- You betrayed her.
- Careful now.

281
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:46,797
And she exiled you.
Twice, I believe.

282
00:34:46,882 --> 00:34:48,465
The second time thanks to you.

283
00:34:48,516 --> 00:34:50,801
Don't blame me for
your crimes, Mormont.

284
00:34:50,852 --> 00:34:53,554
He's right.
Our queen exiled Jorah.

285
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:56,607
And he's right.
Jorah saved her life.

286
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:58,642
Perhaps she feels
differently about him now.

287
00:34:58,644 --> 00:35:01,587
Perhaps not. The only way
we'll know is if we ask her.

288
00:35:02,273 --> 00:35:04,899
<i>Fine, fine. I
suppose he can join us.</i>

289
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,484
Just as long as he promises
not to kill me in my sleep.

290
00:35:07,486 --> 00:35:10,738
If I ever kill you,
your eyes will be wide open.

291
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:13,490
Forgive me, but why
would we bring you?

292
00:35:15,492 --> 00:35:16,327
Pardon me?

293
00:35:16,378 --> 00:35:18,495
Have you ever tracked
animals in the wilderness?

294
00:35:18,497 --> 00:35:21,382
Not precisely, but I have other
skills that would be useful.

295
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:23,417
Can you fight?

296
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:24,835
I have fought.

297
00:35:24,886 --> 00:35:26,670
I don't claim to be
a great warrior.

298
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:28,806
Are you good on a horse?

299
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,174
Middling.

300
00:35:30,225 --> 00:35:32,343
So mainly you talk.

301
00:35:32,345 --> 00:35:34,561
And drink.
I've survived so far.

302
00:35:34,596 --> 00:35:37,982
Which I respect, but you would
not help us on this expedition.

303
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:41,952
You would help us
here in Meereen, though.

304
00:35:42,731 --> 00:35:44,822
None of us have experience
governing a city

305
00:35:44,856 --> 00:35:46,073
except for him.

306
00:35:46,107 --> 00:35:48,108
You want to prove
your value to the queen?

307
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,493
Prove it right here in Meereen.

308
00:35:49,527 --> 00:35:52,279
He's a foreign dwarf that
barely speaks the language.

309
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,781
Why would the Meereenese
listen to him?

310
00:35:53,832 --> 00:35:55,699
They wouldn't.

311
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,618
They will listen to Grey Worm.

312
00:35:57,669 --> 00:35:59,286
I'll come with you.

313
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:01,372
I'll find our queen.

314
00:36:01,374 --> 00:36:03,841
- You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
- I am.

315
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:06,126
He is. He's the toughest man
with no balls I ever met.

316
00:36:06,177 --> 00:36:09,296
But you still can't go.

317
00:36:09,381 --> 00:36:11,048
The people believe in you.

318
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,883
They know you speak
for the queen.

319
00:36:12,934 --> 00:36:14,852
It's true.

320
00:36:14,886 --> 00:36:16,887
Only the Unsullied can keep
the peace in Meereen.

321
00:36:16,972 --> 00:36:20,224
If you leave, half this city
will consume the other half.

322
00:36:20,275 --> 00:36:22,526
And Missandei.

323
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,479
Our queen trusts no one
more than Missandei.

324
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,282
Certainly not me.

325
00:36:28,316 --> 00:36:30,401
The queen's closest confidante,

326
00:36:30,452 --> 00:36:33,120
the commander of the Unsullied,

327
00:36:33,154 --> 00:36:35,906
and a foreign dwarf
with a scarred face.

328
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:38,575
Good fortune, my friends.

329
00:36:38,577 --> 00:36:40,494
Meereen is ancient and glorious.

330
00:36:40,545 --> 00:36:42,579
Try not to ruin her.

331
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:46,083
Looks like it's you and me,
Jorah the Andal.

332
00:36:46,134 --> 00:36:48,218
Let's find some good horses.

333
00:36:48,253 --> 00:36:50,637
We have so much to talk about.

334
00:37:23,588 --> 00:37:25,589
Hello, old friend.

335
00:37:27,342 --> 00:37:31,128
I thought we were so happy
together until you abandoned me.

336
00:37:33,014 --> 00:37:35,799
I suppose there's no point
asking how you found me.

337
00:37:35,801 --> 00:37:38,185
The birds sing in the west,
the birds sing in the east,

338
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:40,471
if one knows how to listen.

339
00:37:41,689 --> 00:37:43,357
They tell me you've
already found favor

340
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:45,476
with the Mother of Dragons.

341
00:37:45,527 --> 00:37:48,278
Well, she didn't execute me,

342
00:37:48,313 --> 00:37:51,648
so that's a promising start.

343
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,784
Now the heroes
are off to find her

344
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:55,986
and I'm stuck here

345
00:37:55,988 --> 00:37:59,623
trying to placate a city
on the brink of civil war.

346
00:37:59,657 --> 00:38:01,408
Any advice for an old comrade?

347
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:02,960
Information is the key.

348
00:38:02,994 --> 00:38:05,546
You need to learn your enemy's
strengths and strategies.

349
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:10,084
You need to learn which of your
friends are not your friends.

350
00:38:10,135 --> 00:38:13,420
If only I knew someone
with a vast network of spies.

351
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:15,506
If only.

352
00:38:17,175 --> 00:38:20,310
A grand old city

353
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:23,063
choking on violence,
corruption, and deceit.

354
00:38:23,098 --> 00:38:26,066
Who could possibly
have any experience

355
00:38:26,151 --> 00:38:28,936
managing such a massive,
ungainly beast?

356
00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:36,860
I did miss you.

357
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:39,780
Oh, I know.

358
00:39:01,386 --> 00:39:03,270
We have to go home.

359
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:12,729
Oh, my poor, sweet thing.

360
00:39:12,814 --> 00:39:14,898
Does it hurt?

361
00:39:17,569 --> 00:39:19,570
We have to go home.

362
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,208
Drogon.

363
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:26,460
Can you take me back to Meereen?

364
00:39:30,582 --> 00:39:33,083
How far did you carry me?

365
00:39:41,176 --> 00:39:43,644
Drogon, we need to return.

366
00:39:43,678 --> 00:39:45,429
My people need me.

367
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:19,713
Well, there's no food.

368
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:22,849
At the very least, you
could hunt us some supper.

369
00:43:00,341 --> 00:43:01,792
Confess.

370
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:07,798
Confess.

371
00:43:19,193 --> 00:43:21,144
I have sinned.

372
00:43:21,195 --> 00:43:23,980
I see that now.

373
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,733
How can I have been
so blind for so long?

374
00:43:28,653 --> 00:43:30,954
I want to be clean again.

375
00:43:32,156 --> 00:43:34,374
I want absolution.

376
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:40,163
The Crone came to me
with her lamp raised high.

377
00:43:40,198 --> 00:43:41,898
And by its holy light--

378
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:44,468
You wish to make a confession?

379
00:43:47,705 --> 00:43:50,140
Once I've confessed,
will I be free?

380
00:43:50,174 --> 00:43:53,176
Your Grace will be dealt
with according to her sins.

381
00:43:55,546 --> 00:43:57,781
The Mother have mercy, then.

382
00:44:00,234 --> 00:44:02,886
I lay with a man outside the
bonds of marriage. I confess.

383
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,654
Name him.

384
00:44:08,826 --> 00:44:10,227
Lancel Lannister.

385
00:44:10,261 --> 00:44:13,497
Your cousin
and the king's squire.

386
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:16,366
- I was lonely and afraid.
- You had a husband.

387
00:44:16,451 --> 00:44:18,418
A husband off whoring
every chance he--

388
00:44:18,453 --> 00:44:21,371
His sins do not pardon your own.

389
00:44:23,407 --> 00:44:25,459
May the gods forgive me.

390
00:44:27,645 --> 00:44:29,346
Other men?

391
00:44:30,431 --> 00:44:31,715
No.

392
00:44:31,717 --> 00:44:33,934
No others?

393
00:44:35,353 --> 00:44:37,187
No.

394
00:44:37,221 --> 00:44:40,724
<i>Speaking falsehoods before
the gods is a great crime.</i>

395
00:44:40,775 --> 00:44:42,309
<i>You understand this?</i>

396
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,027
I do.

397
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,148
There are those
that say your children

398
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:51,034
were not fathered
by King Robert,

399
00:44:51,068 --> 00:44:54,654
that they are bastards
born of incest and adultery.

400
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:56,573
A lie.

401
00:44:56,624 --> 00:44:58,909
A lie from the lips
of Stannis Baratheon.

402
00:44:58,911 --> 00:45:01,628
He wants the throne, but his
brother's children stand in his way.

403
00:45:01,662 --> 00:45:04,915
So he claims they are
not his brother's.

404
00:45:04,966 --> 00:45:06,967
That filth.

405
00:45:08,302 --> 00:45:10,554
There is not one shred
of truth to it.

406
00:45:10,588 --> 00:45:12,722
I deny it.

407
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:16,226
Good.

408
00:45:17,345 --> 00:45:20,764
But these are terrible charges.

409
00:45:20,815 --> 00:45:23,433
And the realm must know
the truth of them.

410
00:45:23,484 --> 00:45:25,936
If Your Grace has given
honest testimony,

411
00:45:25,938 --> 00:45:28,154
your trial will prove
your innocence.

412
00:45:28,189 --> 00:45:30,607
Trial?
I have confessed.

413
00:45:30,691 --> 00:45:32,309
To a single sin.

414
00:45:32,376 --> 00:45:34,277
Others you have denied.

415
00:45:34,328 --> 00:45:38,114
Your trial will separate the
truths from the falsehoods.

416
00:45:40,284 --> 00:45:43,670
I bow to the wisdom
of Your High Holiness.

417
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,958
But if I might beg

418
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,594
for just one drop
of the Mother's mercy.

419
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,632
I haven't seen my son--

420
00:45:55,634 --> 00:45:58,435
I don't know how long it's been.

421
00:45:58,469 --> 00:46:00,303
I need to see him, please.

422
00:46:00,354 --> 00:46:04,174
You have taken the first step on
the path back to righteousness.

423
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:08,044
In light of this,

424
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,780
I will permit you
to return to the Red Keep.

425
00:46:12,984 --> 00:46:14,985
Thank you.

426
00:46:15,036 --> 00:46:16,987
Thank you.

427
00:46:17,038 --> 00:46:18,488
The Mother is merciful.

428
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:20,790
It is her you should thank.

429
00:46:20,825 --> 00:46:22,826
I will. I will.

430
00:46:22,828 --> 00:46:25,128
I swear it, day and night.

431
00:46:27,214 --> 00:46:29,165
Good.

432
00:46:31,836 --> 00:46:34,671
Am I free to go?

433
00:46:34,722 --> 00:46:37,057
After your atonement.

434
00:46:39,644 --> 00:46:41,561
My atonement?

435
00:48:56,147 --> 00:48:59,449
A sinner comes before you.

436
00:48:59,483 --> 00:49:02,702
Cersei of House Lannister.

437
00:49:03,954 --> 00:49:05,855
Mother to His Grace King Tommen.

438
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:09,175
Widow of His Grace King Robert.

439
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:13,329
She has committed
the acts of falsehood

440
00:49:13,414 --> 00:49:15,632
and fornication.

441
00:49:15,666 --> 00:49:18,301
<i>She has confessed her sins</i>

442
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,236
<i>and begged for forgiveness.</i>

443
00:49:20,271 --> 00:49:22,922
<i>To demonstrate her repentance,</i>

444
00:49:22,973 --> 00:49:27,177
<i>she will cast aside</i>
<i>all pride, all artifice,</i>

445
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:30,563
<i>and present herself</i>
<i>as the gods made her</i>

446
00:49:30,598 --> 00:49:33,016
to you,

447
00:49:33,067 --> 00:49:35,685
the good people of the city.

448
00:49:35,687 --> 00:49:39,105
She comes before you
with a solemn heart,

449
00:49:39,156 --> 00:49:41,908
shorn of secrets,

450
00:49:41,942 --> 00:49:45,862
<i>naked before the eyes</i>
<i>of gods and men...</i>

451
00:49:47,364 --> 00:49:50,583
to make her walk of atonement.

452
00:50:11,188 --> 00:50:14,274
Shame.
Shame.

453
00:50:14,308 --> 00:50:16,476
<i>Shame.</i>

454
00:50:17,978 --> 00:50:19,362

<i> Shame. Shame.</i>

Shame.

463

Shame. Shame.

464
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,133
Shame. Shame.

00:50:57,201 --> 00:50:58,351
Shame.

00:51:00,354 --> 00:51:01,855
Shame.

467
00:51:01,906 --> 00:51:03,072

- All hail the royal tits.
<i>-  You're a bitch!</i>

480
00:51:32,102 --> 00:51:33,353
Shame.

481

00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:49,652
I've had half as many

It's good to have you back.

Come.

534
00:55:07,401 --> 00:55:09,102
We'll take you inside.

535
00:55:09,153 --> 00:55:10,853
I need to have a look
at those feet.

536
00:55:16,026 --> 00:55:20,930
May I have the honor of presenting
the newest member of the Kingsguard?

537
00:55:36,463 --> 00:55:40,299
If it please Your Grace, he has
taken a holy vow of silence.

538
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,768
He has sworn
that he will not speak

539
00:55:42,803 --> 00:55:45,555
until all His Grace's
enemies are dead

540
00:55:45,639 --> 00:55:48,524
and evil has been
driven from the realm.

541
00:55:55,232 --> 00:55:57,700
Who came to your aid?
Stannis.

542
00:55:57,734 --> 00:55:58,901
Now he needs you.

543
00:55:58,903 --> 00:56:00,570
We don't have enough men
to make any difference.

544
00:56:00,572 --> 00:56:02,321
The wildlings will make
a difference.

545
00:56:02,372 --> 00:56:03,739
The wildlings will never
fight for Stannis.

546
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:07,210
- I told him before.
- You saved their bloody lives.

547
00:56:07,244 --> 00:56:09,128
If they're gonna live
in the Seven Kingdoms,

548
00:56:09,163 --> 00:56:12,965
safe behind<i> our</i> Wall, they ought
to fight for the damn place.

549
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,968
- It's not their fight.
<i>-  Open the gates!</i>

550
00:56:35,272 --> 00:56:36,689
Stannis?

551
00:56:42,779 --> 00:56:45,748
Shireen?
The princess?

552
00:57:40,337 --> 00:57:41,504
Lord Commander.

553
00:57:41,588 --> 00:57:43,723
<i>It's one of the wildlings</i>
<i>you brought back.</i>

554
00:57:43,757 --> 00:57:45,391
<i>Says he knows your Uncle Benjen.</i>

555
00:57:45,475 --> 00:57:47,093
Says he's still alive.

556
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:50,763
Are you sure he's
talking about Benjen?

557
00:57:50,814 --> 00:57:52,715
Said he was First Ranger.

558
00:57:54,851 --> 00:57:56,819
Said he knows where to find him.

559
00:58:03,577 --> 00:58:05,661
Man says he saw
your uncle at Hardhome

560
00:58:05,696 --> 00:58:07,280
at the last full moon.

561
00:58:07,331 --> 00:58:09,365
- Could be lying.
- Could be.

562
00:58:09,367 --> 00:58:10,700
There are ways to find out.

563
00:58:10,751 --> 00:58:12,752
- Where is he?
- Over there.

564
00:58:29,386 --> 00:58:31,437
For the Watch.

565
00:58:36,143 --> 00:58:37,610
For the Watch.

566
00:58:40,364 --> 00:58:41,731
For the Watch.

567
00:58:43,401 --> 00:58:45,368
For the Watch.

568
00:58:46,703 --> 00:58:49,155
For the Watch.

569
00:59:32,949 --> 00:59:34,367
Olly...

570
00:59:42,292 --> 00:59:44,293
For the Watch.
