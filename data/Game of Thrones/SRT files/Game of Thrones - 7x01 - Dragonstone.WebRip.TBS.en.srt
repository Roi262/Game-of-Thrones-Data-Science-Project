1
00:00:17,436 --> 00:00:20,149
The war is over.
Winter has come.

2
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:21,685
The war is not over.

3
00:00:21,686 --> 00:00:23,976
The true enemy won't
wait out the storm.

4
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,976
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

5
00:00:33,852 --> 00:00:37,061
Our uncle Euron returned
home after a long absence.

6
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:42,532
He murdered our father,
and took the Salt Throne from Yara.

7
00:00:42,652 --> 00:00:44,478
He would have murdered us
if we'd stayed.

8
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:48,686
Build me a thousand ships,
and I will give you this world.

9
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:52,018
There's a storm coming.

10
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,561
You'll be wanting
a roof tonight.

11
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:56,851
I don't have much, but I have
hidden a bit of silver

12
00:00:56,852 --> 00:00:58,977
from the bandits.

13
00:00:59,186 --> 00:01:00,519
What did you do?!

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,443
They'll both be dead
come winter.

15
00:01:03,102 --> 00:01:05,018
Cold winds
are rising in the North.

16
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,685
We need good men to help us.

17
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:09,893
You can still help a lot more
than you've harmed, Clegane.

18
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:11,520
It's not too late for you.

19
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:14,227
Send me to Oldtown.

20
00:01:14,228 --> 00:01:15,936
I'm to be the new maester.

21
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:19,602
The Citadel has the world's
greatest library.

22
00:01:19,603 --> 00:01:22,060
I'll learn about things
that all help when...

23
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:24,851
when they come.

24
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:30,061
Let go of me!

25
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:40,311
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

26
00:01:40,686 --> 00:01:44,645
I'm the three-eyed raven.
I have to be ready for this.

27
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:49,520
Do you know who had this table
carved and painted, Ser Davos?

28
00:01:49,728 --> 00:01:50,962
Aegon Targaryen.

29
00:01:51,436 --> 00:01:54,310
Aegon used to live here, and the
Targaryens built this castle.

30
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:55,591
Aye. So they did.

31
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,061
I want us both to go home.
But they took it from us.

32
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:00,728
How do we go home?

33
00:02:01,353 --> 00:02:03,193
You're in the great game now,

34
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:07,061
and the great game's
terrifying. Are you afraid?

35
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:12,310
My name is Arya Stark.
I want you to know that.

36
00:02:53,102 --> 00:02:56,893
You're wondering why
I brought you all here.

37
00:02:56,894 --> 00:03:00,352
After all, we just had a feast.

38
00:03:00,353 --> 00:03:03,310
Since when does old Walder

39
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:06,310
give us two feasts
in a single fortnight?

40
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:11,769
Well, it's no good being
Lord of the Riverlands

41
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,143
if you can't celebrate
with your family.

42
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:15,644
That's what I say!

43
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:19,060
Yes!

44
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:26,810
I've gathered every Frey
who means a damn thing

45
00:03:26,811 --> 00:03:32,143
so I can tell you my plans
for this great house

46
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:35,018
now that winter has come.

47
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:38,186
But first, a toast!

48
00:03:39,728 --> 00:03:43,435
No more of that
Dornish horse piss!

49
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:46,393
This is the finest Arbor gold!

50
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:49,393
Proper wine for proper heroes!

51
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:56,769
Stand together!

52
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,019
Stand together!

53
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,185
Not you.

54
00:04:09,186 --> 00:04:12,102
I'm not wasting good wine
on a damn woman.

55
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,143
Maybe I'm not
the most pleasant man.

56
00:04:20,144 --> 00:04:23,560
I'll admit it.
But I'm proud of you lot.

57
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:26,685
You're my family,
the men who helped me

58
00:04:26,686 --> 00:04:29,727
slaughter the Starks
at the Red Wedding.

59
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:33,851
Yes, yes.

60
00:04:33,852 --> 00:04:36,519
Cheer.

61
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,851
Brave men, all of you.

62
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:43,435
Butchered a woman
pregnant with her babe.

63
00:04:43,436 --> 00:04:49,268
Cut the throat
of a mother of five.

64
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:52,393
Slaughtered your guests
after inviting them

65
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:54,144
into your home.

66
00:04:55,811 --> 00:05:01,435
But you didn't slaughter
every one of the Starks.

67
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:06,185
No, no, that was your mistake.

68
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:10,060
You should have ripped them
all out, root and stem.

69
00:05:16,603 --> 00:05:18,935
Leave one wolf alive

70
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:21,603
and the sheep are never safe.

71
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:49,520
When people ask you
what happened here...

72
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:52,811
tell them the North remembers.

73
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:58,144
Tell them winter came
for House Frey.

74
00:07:53,709 --> 00:08:04,802

75
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:22,352
You wildlings?

76
00:10:22,353 --> 00:10:25,269
I'm Meera Reed,
daughter of Howland Reed.

77
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:28,769
This is Brandon Stark,

78
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,977
son of Ned Stark.

79
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:36,811
How do I know that's true?

80
00:10:39,977 --> 00:10:43,310
You were at
the Fist of the First Men.

81
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:44,770
You were at Hardhome.

82
00:10:46,936 --> 00:10:48,645
You've seen
the Army of the Dead.

83
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,894
You've seen the Night King.

84
00:10:52,977 --> 00:10:54,977
He's coming for us.

85
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:57,311
For all of us.

86
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:07,060
Okay, come on.

87
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:09,144
Let's get them inside.

88
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:41,435
I want every northern
maester to scour their records

89
00:11:41,436 --> 00:11:44,602
for any mention of dragonglass.

90
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,685
Dragonglass kills white walkers.

91
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:49,352
It's more valuable
to us now than gold.

92
00:11:49,353 --> 00:11:51,018
We need to find it,
we need to mine it,

93
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:52,728
we need to make weapons from it.

94
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:57,060
Everyone aged 10 to 60

95
00:11:57,061 --> 00:12:00,310
will drill daily with spears,
pikes, bow and arrow.

96
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:03,519
It's about time we taught these
boys of summer how to fight.

97
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,810
Not just the boys.

98
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:08,310
We can't defend the North

99
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,477
if only half the population is fighting.

100
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:15,185
You expect me to put a spear
in my granddaughter's hand?

101
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:18,851
I don't plan on knitting by the
fire while men fight for me.

102
00:12:18,852 --> 00:12:21,935
I might be small, Lord Glover,
and I might be a girl,

103
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:24,393
but I am every bit as much
a Northerner as you.

104
00:12:24,394 --> 00:12:26,268
Indeed you are, my lady.
No one has questioned...

105
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:28,394
And I don't need your
permission to defend the North.

106
00:12:31,311 --> 00:12:36,143
We'll begin training every man,
woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island.

107
00:12:36,144 --> 00:12:38,227
Aye!

108
00:12:38,228 --> 00:12:39,727
While we're
preparing for attack,

109
00:12:39,728 --> 00:12:42,060
we need to shore up
our defenses.

110
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:45,560
The only thing standing between us and
the Army of the Dead is the Wall,

111
00:12:45,561 --> 00:12:49,477
and the Wall hasn't been
properly manned in centuries.

112
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,894
I'm not the king
of the Free Folk.

113
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:55,769
But if we're going to survive
this winter together...

114
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:59,976
You want us to man
the castles for you?

115
00:12:59,977 --> 00:13:01,560
Aye.

116
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:04,393
Last time we saw the Night
King was at Hardhome.

117
00:13:04,394 --> 00:13:07,727
The closest castle to Hardhome
is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

118
00:13:07,728 --> 00:13:09,268
Then that's where I'll go.

119
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:12,435
Looks like we're
the Night's Watch now.

120
00:13:14,811 --> 00:13:16,310
If they breach the Wall,

121
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:17,851
the first two castles
in their path

122
00:13:17,852 --> 00:13:20,393
are Last Hearth and Karhold.

123
00:13:20,394 --> 00:13:24,060
The Umbers and the Karstarks
betrayed the North.

124
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:25,685
Their castles
should be torn down

125
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:27,435
with not a stone left standing.

126
00:13:27,436 --> 00:13:30,018
The castles committed no crimes.

127
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:33,435
And we need every fortress
we have for the war to come.

128
00:13:33,436 --> 00:13:36,769
We should give the Last Hearth
and Karhold to new families,

129
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,310
loyal families who supported
us against Ramsay.

130
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:42,519
Aye!

131
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,810
The Umbers and the Karstarks

132
00:13:44,811 --> 00:13:47,310
have fought beside
the Starks for centuries.

133
00:13:47,311 --> 00:13:49,921
They've kept faith for
generation after generation.

134
00:13:49,923 --> 00:13:51,477
And then they broke faith.

135
00:13:51,478 --> 00:13:54,560
I'm not going to strip these
families of their ancestral homes

136
00:13:54,561 --> 00:13:57,143
because of the crimes
of a few reckless sons.

137
00:13:57,144 --> 00:13:58,810
So there's no
punishment for treason

138
00:13:58,811 --> 00:14:01,311
and no reward for loyalty?

139
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:09,143
The punishment
for treason is death.

140
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:11,976
Smalljon Umber died
on the field of battle.

141
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:14,810
Harald Karstark died
on the field of battle.

142
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:17,227
They died fighting for Ramsay.

143
00:14:17,228 --> 00:14:18,810
Give the castles to the families

144
00:14:18,811 --> 00:14:21,185
of the men who died
fighting for you.

145
00:14:34,394 --> 00:14:37,311
When I was Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch...

146
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,143
I executed men who betrayed me.

147
00:14:41,144 --> 00:14:45,393
I executed men who
refused to follow orders.

148
00:14:45,394 --> 00:14:47,185
My father always said,

149
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,769
"The man who passes the sentence
should swing the sword,"

150
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,060
and I have tried
to live by those words.

151
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:56,519
But I will not punish a son
for his father's sins,

152
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,976
and I will not take
a family home away

153
00:14:58,977 --> 00:15:02,352
from a family it has
belonged to for centuries.

154
00:15:02,353 --> 00:15:04,935
That is my decision,

155
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:07,520
and my decision is final.

156
00:15:13,728 --> 00:15:14,728
Ned Umber.

157
00:15:22,728 --> 00:15:24,061
Alys Karstark.

158
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:40,893
For centuries,
our families fought

159
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:43,727
side by side on the battlefield.

160
00:15:43,728 --> 00:15:48,727
I ask you to pledge your loyalty
once again to House Stark,

161
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:51,268
to serve as our bannermen

162
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:53,977
and come to our aid
whenever called upon.

163
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,894
Stand.

164
00:16:07,603 --> 00:16:10,393
Yesterday's wars
don't matter anymore.

165
00:16:10,394 --> 00:16:13,393
The North needs
to band together,

166
00:16:13,394 --> 00:16:14,770
all the living north.

167
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:18,435
Will you stand beside me,
Ned and Alys,

168
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,685
now and always?

169
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:23,143
Now and always!

170
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,519
You are my sister,
but I am king now.

171
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,143
Will you start wearing a crown?

172
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:47,769
When you question my decisions

173
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,935
in front of the other lords
and ladies, you undermine me.

174
00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:51,546
So I can't question
your decisions anymore?

175
00:16:51,548 --> 00:16:52,644
Of course you can, but...

176
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,976
Joffrey never let anyone
question his authority.

177
00:16:54,977 --> 00:16:56,977
You think he was a good king?

178
00:16:58,645 --> 00:17:00,603
Do you think I'm Joffrey?

179
00:17:04,228 --> 00:17:07,143
You're as far from Joffrey
as anyone I've ever met.

180
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:08,645
Thank you.

181
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:12,352
You're good at this, you know.

182
00:17:12,353 --> 00:17:14,810
- At what?
- At ruling.

183
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:16,644
No.

184
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:17,645
You are.

185
00:17:18,686 --> 00:17:20,144
You are.

186
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:23,935
They respect you,
they really do,

187
00:17:23,936 --> 00:17:26,101
but you have to...

188
00:17:26,102 --> 00:17:27,519
Why are you laughing?

189
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,685
What did father used to say?

190
00:17:29,686 --> 00:17:33,018
Everything before the
word "but" is horse shit.

191
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,519
He never said that to me.

192
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,227
No. No, he never cursed
in front of his girls.

193
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:40,310
Because he was
trying to protect us.

194
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:43,310
He never wanted us to see
how dirty the world really is,

195
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:46,018
but Father couldn't protect
me and neither can you.

196
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:47,304
Stop trying.

197
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:48,727
All right, I'll stop
trying to protect you

198
00:17:48,728 --> 00:17:50,101
and you stop trying
to undermine me.

199
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,311
I'm not trying to undermine you!

200
00:17:53,852 --> 00:17:56,893
You have to be
smarter than Father.

201
00:17:56,894 --> 00:17:59,560
You need to be
smarter than Robb.

202
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:02,685
I loved them, I miss them,
but they made stupid mistakes,

203
00:18:02,686 --> 00:18:04,727
and they both
lost their heads for it.

204
00:18:04,728 --> 00:18:06,935
And how should I be smarter?

205
00:18:06,936 --> 00:18:08,394
By listening to you?

206
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,727
Would that be so terrible?

207
00:18:13,728 --> 00:18:16,686
A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace.

208
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:28,727
"Cersei of House Lannister,
First of Her Name,

209
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:30,644
Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

210
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:32,268
Protector of
the Seven Kingdoms..."

211
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:33,728
What does she want?

212
00:18:34,977 --> 00:18:37,769
Come to King's Landing.

213
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,602
Bend the knee or suffer
the fate of all traitors.

214
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:43,727
You've been so consumed
with the enemy to the north,

215
00:18:43,728 --> 00:18:45,560
you've forgotten about
the one to the south.

216
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:48,602
I'm consumed with the Night
King because I've seen him.

217
00:18:48,603 --> 00:18:51,227
And believe me, you'd think
of little else if you had, too.

218
00:18:51,228 --> 00:18:52,935
We still have a wall between
us and the Night King.

219
00:18:52,936 --> 00:18:54,769
There's nothing
between us and Cersei.

220
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,685
There's a thousand miles
between us and Cersei.

221
00:18:57,686 --> 00:19:00,477
Winter is here. The Lannisters
are a southern army.

222
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:01,935
They've never ranged
this far north.

223
00:19:01,936 --> 00:19:05,268
You're the military man,
but I know her.

224
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,602
If you're her enemy, she'll never
stop until she's destroyed you.

225
00:19:08,603 --> 00:19:11,770
Everyone who's ever crossed her,
she's found a way to murder.

226
00:19:14,852 --> 00:19:16,936
You almost sound
as if you admire her.

227
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,770
I learned a great deal from her.

228
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:01,477
What is this?

229
00:20:01,478 --> 00:20:04,143
It's what we've been
waiting for our whole lives.

230
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:06,935
It's what Father trained us for,
whether he knew it or not.

231
00:20:06,936 --> 00:20:08,435
He knew it.

232
00:20:08,436 --> 00:20:10,393
Made me memorize
every damn city, town,

233
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:11,976
lake, forest, and mountain.

234
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,144
It's ours now.
We just have to take it.

235
00:20:15,686 --> 00:20:18,018
You've been quiet
since you came home.

236
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:19,477
Are you angry with me?

237
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:21,728
No, not angry.

238
00:20:22,852 --> 00:20:23,852
Are you afraid of me?

239
00:20:25,852 --> 00:20:26,977
Should I be?

240
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,685
Daenerys Targaryen has chosen
Tyrion to be her Hand.

241
00:20:34,686 --> 00:20:37,477
Right now, they're sailing
across the Narrow Sea,

242
00:20:37,478 --> 00:20:40,477
hoping to take back
her father's throne.

243
00:20:40,478 --> 00:20:42,893
Our little brother,

244
00:20:42,894 --> 00:20:45,060
the one you love so much,

245
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:46,893
the one you set free,

246
00:20:46,894 --> 00:20:50,185
the one who murdered our
father and our first-born son,

247
00:20:50,186 --> 00:20:53,520
now he stands beside our enemies
and gives them counsel.

248
00:20:57,228 --> 00:21:01,227
He's out there somewhere
at the head of an armada.

249
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:02,936
Where will they land?

250
00:21:05,728 --> 00:21:07,060
Dragonstone.

251
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:09,851
They have deep-water
ports for the ships.

252
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,851
Stannis left
the castle unoccupied,

253
00:21:11,852 --> 00:21:13,310
and that's where she was born.

254
00:21:13,311 --> 00:21:15,602
Enemies to the east.

255
00:21:15,603 --> 00:21:17,393
Enemies to the south...

256
00:21:17,394 --> 00:21:20,393
Ellaria Sand
and her brood of bitches.

257
00:21:20,394 --> 00:21:22,227
Enemies to the west...

258
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:24,060
Olenna, the old cunt.

259
00:21:24,061 --> 00:21:27,268
Another traitor.

260
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:29,435
Enemies to the north.

261
00:21:29,436 --> 00:21:32,560
Ned Stark's bastard has been
named King in the North

262
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:35,560
and that murdering whore
Sansa stands beside him.

263
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,227
Enemies everywhere.
We're surrounded by traitors.

264
00:21:38,228 --> 00:21:39,935
You're in command
of the Lannister army now.

265
00:21:39,936 --> 00:21:43,060
- How do we proceed?
- Winter is here.

266
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:46,352
We can't win a war if we can't
feed our men and our horses.

267
00:21:46,353 --> 00:21:50,519
The Tyrells have the grain,
the Tyrells have the livestock.

268
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,560
Will the Tyrell bannermen
stand alongside

269
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,851
a Dothraki horde
and Unsullied slave soldiers?

270
00:21:55,852 --> 00:21:58,519
If they think Daenerys will win.

271
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,477
No one wants to fight
on the losing side.

272
00:22:00,478 --> 00:22:03,603
Right now, we look like the losing side.

273
00:22:04,894 --> 00:22:06,727
I'm the Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms.

274
00:22:06,728 --> 00:22:09,477
Three kingdoms, at best.

275
00:22:09,478 --> 00:22:12,018
I'm not sure you understand
how much danger we're in.

276
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:13,810
I understand we're
in a war for survival.

277
00:22:13,811 --> 00:22:16,851
I understand whoever loses dies.

278
00:22:16,852 --> 00:22:19,143
I understand whoever wins
could launch a dynasty

279
00:22:19,144 --> 00:22:20,727
that lasts a thousand years.

280
00:22:20,728 --> 00:22:23,310
A dynasty for whom?

281
00:22:23,311 --> 00:22:26,310
Our children are dead.

282
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,769
We're the last of us.

283
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,811
A dynasty for us, then.

284
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,520
We never talked about Tommen.

285
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,477
There's nothing to say.

286
00:22:39,478 --> 00:22:41,435
Our baby boy killed himself.

287
00:22:41,436 --> 00:22:42,976
He betrayed me.

288
00:22:42,977 --> 00:22:44,477
He betrayed us both.

289
00:22:44,478 --> 00:22:46,310
Should we spend our days
mourning the dead...

290
00:22:46,311 --> 00:22:47,727
Mother, father,
and all our children?

291
00:22:47,728 --> 00:22:50,310
- Cersei...
- I loved them. I did.

292
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:53,519
But they're ashes now and
we're still flesh and blood.

293
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,520
We're the last Lannisters,
the last ones who count.

294
00:23:02,353 --> 00:23:05,018
Even Lannisters can't
survive without allies.

295
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:08,185
Where are our allies now?

296
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,393
You saw what happened to
Walder Frey and his family.

297
00:23:10,394 --> 00:23:12,060
I heard.

298
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:14,602
- How could we ever trust a man like that?
- We couldn't.

299
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:16,602
He was a useless, old coward,

300
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,435
but the Freys supported us.

301
00:23:18,436 --> 00:23:19,810
Now they're all dead.

302
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:21,519
Whoever killed them
is no friend of ours.

303
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,060
We need allies.

304
00:23:23,061 --> 00:23:24,851
Stronger, better allies.

305
00:23:24,852 --> 00:23:26,977
We can't win this war alone.

306
00:23:28,977 --> 00:23:32,603
You think I listened to Father for
40 years and learned nothing?

307
00:24:09,603 --> 00:24:11,101
The Greyjoys?

308
00:24:11,102 --> 00:24:13,685
You invited the Greyjoys
to King's Landing?

309
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:16,519
- Not all of them.
- Well, it looks like all of them.

310
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,101
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

311
00:24:18,102 --> 00:24:20,602
the new King
of the Iron Islands.

312
00:24:20,603 --> 00:24:23,310
You said yourself we needed
stronger, better allies.

313
00:24:23,311 --> 00:24:26,435
- There you are.
- How are they better allies?

314
00:24:26,436 --> 00:24:28,851
How are they different
from the Freys?

315
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:30,435
They both broke their promises

316
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:32,727
and murdered their former friends
as soon as it suited them.

317
00:24:32,728 --> 00:24:35,727
So does everyone
when it suits them.

318
00:24:35,728 --> 00:24:38,352
Unlike the Freys,
they have ships.

319
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:40,976
- And they're good at killing.
- They're not good at anything.

320
00:24:40,977 --> 00:24:44,393
I know the ironborn. They're
bitter, angry little people.

321
00:24:44,394 --> 00:24:47,602
All they know how to do is steal things
they can't build or grow themselves.

322
00:24:47,603 --> 00:24:49,727
Euron Greyjoy didn't
come here for that.

323
00:24:49,728 --> 00:24:51,769
Oh, what did
he come here for, then?

324
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,436
A queen.

325
00:25:06,144 --> 00:25:09,352
The moment I was chosen
Lord of the Iron Islands,

326
00:25:09,353 --> 00:25:11,727
they turned on me.

327
00:25:11,728 --> 00:25:12,976
Their own uncle.

328
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:15,602
They stole
my best ships and ran.

329
00:25:15,603 --> 00:25:17,769
Sailed them
right across the world

330
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,060
and gave them
to the Dragon Queen

331
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:23,519
so she could bring her
armies here to attack you.

332
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,976
It's nothing compared
to the treason you suffered

333
00:25:26,977 --> 00:25:30,644
at the hands of a family
member, from what I hear.

334
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:33,353
But still, it bothers me.

335
00:25:34,977 --> 00:25:38,018
Murdering them would
make me feel a lot better.

336
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:42,185
And since it appears that all
our treasonous family members

337
00:25:42,186 --> 00:25:44,101
are fighting for the same side,

338
00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:46,644
I thought we rightful monarchs

339
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,228
could murder them together.

340
00:25:55,228 --> 00:25:58,019
You're not a rightful
monarch, though, are you?

341
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:05,143
The Greyjoys rebelled against the
throne for the right to be monarchs,

342
00:26:05,144 --> 00:26:09,185
but as I recall,
you were soundly defeated.

343
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:11,018
Come to mention it,

344
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:13,393
weren't you the one
who started that rebellion

345
00:26:13,394 --> 00:26:17,602
by sailing to Casterly Rock
and burning the Lannister fleet?

346
00:26:17,603 --> 00:26:19,310
You certainly caught us there.

347
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:22,143
Very smart move on your part.

348
00:26:22,144 --> 00:26:26,393
Of course, we all made it
to the Iron Islands anyway.

349
00:26:26,394 --> 00:26:27,602
I was there.

350
00:26:27,603 --> 00:26:29,435
I remember very well.

351
00:26:29,436 --> 00:26:30,976
I saw you.

352
00:26:30,977 --> 00:26:33,268
I heard so much talk.

353
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:36,893
The best in the world.
No one can stop him.

354
00:26:36,894 --> 00:26:38,602
I didn't believe it,
to be honest.

355
00:26:38,603 --> 00:26:41,893
But I must say when you
rushed through the breach

356
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:44,061
and started
cutting people down...

357
00:26:47,561 --> 00:26:49,268
it was glorious.

358
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:50,685
Like a dance.

359
00:26:50,686 --> 00:26:53,893
The people I was cutting
down were your own kin.

360
00:26:53,894 --> 00:26:56,227
The place was getting crowded.

361
00:26:56,228 --> 00:26:58,810
I enjoyed watching it.
I truly did.

362
00:26:58,811 --> 00:27:01,018
And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.

363
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,477
A good thing for me.

364
00:27:03,478 --> 00:27:07,101
If you hadn't crushed us, I
wouldn't have gone into exile.

365
00:27:07,102 --> 00:27:09,018
If I hadn't done that,

366
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:12,603
I wouldn't be the greatest
captain on the 14 seas.

367
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:15,478
If not the most humble.

368
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,770
You're not humble.

369
00:27:19,728 --> 00:27:21,728
You're the queen
of a great nation.

370
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:24,685
You don't care about
the Iron Islands.

371
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:29,352
They're nothing but rocks
and bird shit and...

372
00:27:29,353 --> 00:27:32,227
And a lot of very
unattractive people.

373
00:27:32,228 --> 00:27:34,851
The Iron Fleet,
on the other hand,

374
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:37,976
that's something else entirely.

375
00:27:37,977 --> 00:27:41,268
It's the greatest armada
Westeros has ever seen.

376
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:45,851
With the Iron Fleet,
you own the seas.

377
00:27:45,852 --> 00:27:48,685
You can defeat
the invaders of the east

378
00:27:48,686 --> 00:27:51,644
and the pretenders
of the north and south.

379
00:27:51,645 --> 00:27:53,269
What do you want in return?

380
00:27:55,353 --> 00:27:58,393
Ever since I was a little boy,

381
00:27:58,394 --> 00:28:00,310
I wanted to grow up and marry

382
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,435
the most beautiful woman
in the world.

383
00:28:02,436 --> 00:28:05,143
So here I am,

384
00:28:05,144 --> 00:28:07,602
with a thousand ships

385
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,144
and two good hands.

386
00:28:14,561 --> 00:28:16,144
I decline your proposal.

387
00:28:18,645 --> 00:28:19,685
Why?

388
00:28:19,686 --> 00:28:21,353
You're not trustworthy.

389
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,851
You've broken promises
to allies before

390
00:28:24,852 --> 00:28:27,310
and murdered them
at the nearest opportunity.

391
00:28:27,311 --> 00:28:28,852
You murdered your own brother.

392
00:28:30,186 --> 00:28:32,519
You should try it.
Feels wonderful.

393
00:28:34,144 --> 00:28:36,185
I don't expect you
to trust me outright.

394
00:28:36,186 --> 00:28:38,560
You need proof
of my honest intentions.

395
00:28:38,561 --> 00:28:40,018
In my experience,

396
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:43,018
the surest way to a woman's
heart is with a gift.

397
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:45,310
A priceless gift.

398
00:28:45,311 --> 00:28:47,185
I won't return to King's Landing

399
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:49,228
until I have that for you.

400
00:31:55,228 --> 00:31:58,060
Ah, Maester Weyland.

401
00:31:58,061 --> 00:32:01,561
A drinker's
liver if ever I saw one.

402
00:32:02,811 --> 00:32:03,811
Weigh that.

403
00:32:04,977 --> 00:32:08,268
The triumph
of transitory pleasures.

404
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:10,185
Mankind's curse.

405
00:32:10,186 --> 00:32:13,268
Archmaester, I was wondering...

406
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:15,227
What's the weight?

407
00:32:15,228 --> 00:32:18,186
Um, 147.

408
00:32:21,102 --> 00:32:24,185
I was wondering if you had
considered my proposition.

409
00:32:24,186 --> 00:32:27,268
I don't remember
your proposition.

410
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:30,560
I asked you if, in light of
what I've seen in the North,

411
00:32:30,561 --> 00:32:33,727
if I could have access to the
restricted area of the library.

412
00:32:33,728 --> 00:32:35,435
That area is reserved
for maesters.

413
00:32:35,436 --> 00:32:37,935
- Are you a maester?
- No.

414
00:32:37,936 --> 00:32:40,061
Not a very strong
proposition, is it?

415
00:32:49,353 --> 00:32:52,018
Archmaester, with respect,

416
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:53,851
I've seen them...

417
00:32:53,852 --> 00:32:56,101
The Army of the Dead.

418
00:32:56,102 --> 00:32:58,477
The white walkers.

419
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:00,976
I was sent here to learn
how to defeat them,

420
00:33:00,977 --> 00:33:03,519
but everyone in the Citadel,

421
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,685
those who will even talk to me,

422
00:33:05,686 --> 00:33:08,519
they all doubt the walkers ever
existed in the first place.

423
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,060
Everyone in the Citadel
doubts everything.

424
00:33:11,061 --> 00:33:12,144
It's their job.

425
00:33:17,686 --> 00:33:20,977
But the tales of the Long Night
can't be pure fabrication.

426
00:33:22,811 --> 00:33:25,727
Too many similarities
from unconnected sources.

427
00:33:25,728 --> 00:33:28,310
Sources in the restricted area?

428
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:29,936
The very same.

429
00:33:31,228 --> 00:33:32,685
And the simplest explanation

430
00:33:32,686 --> 00:33:35,644
for your grating obsession
with the white walkers

431
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:37,143
is that you're telling the truth

432
00:33:37,144 --> 00:33:40,268
and that you saw
what you say you saw.

433
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:43,144
So, you believe me.

434
00:33:44,311 --> 00:33:45,976
I do.

435
00:33:45,977 --> 00:33:47,686
You'll finish
weighing that heart?

436
00:33:49,977 --> 00:33:52,811
That makes you the only person
south of the Twins who does.

437
00:33:55,852 --> 00:33:58,685
We're not like the people
south of the Twins.

438
00:33:58,686 --> 00:34:00,894
And we're not like the
people north of the Twins.

439
00:34:03,228 --> 00:34:07,144
In the Citadel, we lead different
lives for different reasons.

440
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:11,810
We are this world's memory,
Samwell Tarly.

441
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:14,769
Without us, men would be
little better than dogs.

442
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,935
Don't remember
any meal but the last,

443
00:34:16,936 --> 00:34:19,602
can't see forward
to any but the next.

444
00:34:19,603 --> 00:34:21,769
And every time you leave the
house and shut the door,

445
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:24,685
they howl like
you're gone forever.

446
00:34:24,686 --> 00:34:27,685
When Robert's Rebellion
was raging,

447
00:34:27,686 --> 00:34:29,519
people thought the end was near.

448
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,602
The end of the Targaryen dynasty.
"How will we survive?"

449
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:36,060
When Aegon Targaryen
turned his eye westward

450
00:34:36,061 --> 00:34:38,018
and flew his dragons
to Blackwater Rush...

451
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:40,060
"The end is near!
How will we survive?"

452
00:34:40,061 --> 00:34:42,935
And thousands of years before
that, during the Long Night,

453
00:34:42,936 --> 00:34:45,060
we can forgive them for
thinking it truly was the end.

454
00:34:45,061 --> 00:34:47,770
But it wasn't.
None of it was.

455
00:34:49,561 --> 00:34:52,102
The Wall has stood
through it all.

456
00:34:53,394 --> 00:34:56,353
And every winter
that ever came has ended.

457
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,728
Be a good lad.
Clean this up.

458
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,228
Nope.

459
00:36:09,311 --> 00:36:10,353
Nope.

460
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,811
You're a lucky man.

461
00:36:29,269 --> 00:36:32,144
I've heard she
beat the Hound in single combat.

462
00:36:36,852 --> 00:36:38,436
She's a very impressive woman.

463
00:36:39,852 --> 00:36:41,977
What do you want, Lord Baelish?

464
00:36:45,353 --> 00:36:47,352
I want you to be happy.

465
00:36:47,353 --> 00:36:49,727
I want you to be safe.

466
00:36:49,728 --> 00:36:51,018
I am safe.

467
00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:54,185
I'm at home,
surrounded by friends.

468
00:36:54,186 --> 00:36:57,561
I have Brienne to protect me
from anyone who would harm me.

469
00:37:01,436 --> 00:37:03,228
What about happy?

470
00:37:05,894 --> 00:37:07,727
Why aren't you happy?

471
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:09,685
What do you want
that you do not have?

472
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,435
At the moment, peace and quiet.

473
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:20,727
No need to seize the
last word, Lord Baelish.

474
00:37:20,728 --> 00:37:23,102
I'll assume it was
something clever.

475
00:37:25,353 --> 00:37:26,935
My lady.

476
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:28,728
My lady.

477
00:37:39,228 --> 00:37:40,769
Why is he still here?

478
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:43,519
We need his men.

479
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,102
Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton
would still hold this castle.

480
00:37:48,561 --> 00:37:50,102
Littlefinger saved us.

481
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:55,894
He wants something.

482
00:37:57,686 --> 00:38:00,019
I know exactly what he wants.

483
00:38:05,144 --> 00:38:08,769
♪ He rode through the
streets of the city ♪

484
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:11,810
♪ Down from
his hill on high ♪

485
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:15,393
♪ O'er the winds and the steps
and the cobbles ♪

486
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:18,893
♪ He rode
to a woman's sigh ♪

487
00:38:18,894 --> 00:38:22,101
♪ For she was
his secret treasure ♪

488
00:38:22,102 --> 00:38:25,519
♪ She was his shame
and his bliss ♪

489
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,435
♪ And a chain and a keep
are nothing ♪

490
00:38:28,436 --> 00:38:31,101
♪ Compared to
a woman's kiss ♪

491
00:38:31,102 --> 00:38:34,602
♪ For hands of
gold are always cold ♪

492
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,268
♪ But a woman's hands
are warm ♪

493
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:41,101
♪ For hands of gold
are always cold ♪

494
00:38:41,102 --> 00:38:44,102
♪ But a woman's hands are... ♪

495
00:38:45,394 --> 00:38:46,851
That's a pretty song.

496
00:38:46,852 --> 00:38:47,935
I've never heard it before.

497
00:38:47,936 --> 00:38:49,393
It's a new one.

498
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:52,393
Are you hungry?
We've got some rabbit.

499
00:38:52,394 --> 00:38:53,851
I don't want to steal your food.

500
00:38:53,852 --> 00:38:56,227
You're not stealing,
we're offering.

501
00:38:56,228 --> 00:38:58,603
Come on, it's gonna be a cold night.

502
00:39:27,102 --> 00:39:28,602
You heading south?

503
00:39:28,603 --> 00:39:30,685
King's Landing.

504
00:39:30,686 --> 00:39:32,769
Poor girl.

505
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,435
Not so bad, is it?

506
00:39:35,436 --> 00:39:37,560
Depends on your taste, I guess.

507
00:39:37,561 --> 00:39:40,851
If you like your streets covered in shit
and pig's blood, it's the town for you.

508
00:39:41,562 --> 00:39:43,685
All my life, I
wanted to see the Red Keep,

509
00:39:43,686 --> 00:39:45,851
the Sept of Baelor,
the Dragonpit.

510
00:39:45,852 --> 00:39:47,810
Then when I finally make it,

511
00:39:47,811 --> 00:39:50,018
they wouldn't let me within
a mile of the Red Keep,

512
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:51,976
the Sept of Baelor's
blown to hell,

513
00:39:51,977 --> 00:39:53,935
and the Dragonpit
is a damn ruin.

514
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:55,810
The people who live there,

515
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:58,519
they'd skin you alive if they could
make two coppers off your hide.

516
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,644
Worst place in the world.

517
00:40:00,645 --> 00:40:03,018
What are you doing
in the Riverlands?

518
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:05,602
There's been some trouble with
the Freys up at the Twins,

519
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:08,936
so we're part of the army that's
been sent to keep the peace.

520
00:40:12,019 --> 00:40:14,851
Here you go.
Guests first.

521
00:40:14,852 --> 00:40:16,976
Oh, no, I couldn't.
You don't have enough.

522
00:40:16,977 --> 00:40:19,435
My mother always told me
to be kind to strangers.

523
00:40:19,436 --> 00:40:21,394
Strangers will be kind to you.

524
00:40:33,894 --> 00:40:35,976
You're a long way from home.

525
00:40:35,977 --> 00:40:38,060
I'm sure you've had
some adventures, though.

526
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:40,893
Yeah, endless adventures.

527
00:40:40,894 --> 00:40:42,894
They'll be singing about
us for a thousand years.

528
00:40:43,561 --> 00:40:47,227
The truth is when we left home,
we couldn't wait to get away.

529
00:40:47,228 --> 00:40:49,560
But now we've been gone a while,
we can't wait to get home.

530
00:40:49,561 --> 00:40:53,602
I just think about my dad out
there on his boat all alone.

531
00:40:53,603 --> 00:40:54,977
I ought to be
out there with him.

532
00:40:57,102 --> 00:40:58,935
My wife just had our first baby.

533
00:40:58,936 --> 00:41:01,227
- Boy or girl?
- Oh, who knows?

534
00:41:01,228 --> 00:41:03,393
You think soldiers get
ravens with news from home?

535
00:41:07,186 --> 00:41:09,851
- I hope it's a girl.
- Why?

536
00:41:09,852 --> 00:41:12,810
Girls take care of their papas
when their papas grow old.

537
00:41:12,811 --> 00:41:14,811
Boys just go off to fight
in someone else's wars.

538
00:41:17,645 --> 00:41:19,394
Are you old enough to drink?

539
00:41:34,852 --> 00:41:36,727
It's blackberry wine.

540
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:38,019
I made it myself.

541
00:41:39,478 --> 00:41:40,603
It's really good.

542
00:41:42,728 --> 00:41:46,102
So, why is a nice girl on her
own heading to King's Landing?

543
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:55,645
I'm going to kill the queen.

544
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:19,018
Bad night to be outdoors.

545
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:21,851
You've got real
powerful magic to figure that out.

546
00:42:21,852 --> 00:42:25,935
Did the Lord of Light
whisper that in your ear?

547
00:42:25,936 --> 00:42:29,101
"It's snowing, Thoros.
It's windy.

548
00:42:29,102 --> 00:42:32,060
It's gonna be
a cold night."

549
00:42:32,061 --> 00:42:35,935
You're a grouchy old bear,
aren't you, Clegane?

550
00:42:35,936 --> 00:42:37,602
You want some rum?

551
00:42:37,603 --> 00:42:40,685
Don't like that shit.
It's too sweet.

552
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:42,728
Why are you always
in such a foul mood?

553
00:42:44,894 --> 00:42:47,019
Experience.

554
00:42:51,186 --> 00:42:53,478
This seems like a good
place to spend the night.

555
00:42:56,144 --> 00:42:58,560
These people don't want us here.

556
00:42:58,561 --> 00:43:01,477
Seems deserted to me.
No livestock.

557
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:03,436
No smoke coming
from the chimney.

558
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:24,393
I don't like the look of it.

559
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:27,393
For a big, hard man,
you scare easy.

560
00:43:27,394 --> 00:43:30,018
I'll tell you
what doesn't scare me...

561
00:43:30,019 --> 00:43:32,018
Bald cocksuckers like you.

562
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:34,893
You think you're fooling
anyone with that top knot?

563
00:43:34,894 --> 00:43:36,686
Bald cunt.

564
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,310
Come on.

565
00:43:40,311 --> 00:43:42,144
Maybe they've got
some ale hidden away.

566
00:43:43,811 --> 00:43:45,268
They don't.

567
00:43:48,186 --> 00:43:49,851
See if there's a larder.

568
00:43:49,852 --> 00:43:51,561
They always leave
something behind.

569
00:44:33,228 --> 00:44:34,588
How do you think
it ended for them?

570
00:44:36,144 --> 00:44:37,352
With death.

571
00:44:37,353 --> 00:44:40,310
Girl died in her father's arms.

572
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:43,144
Both of them covered in blood
and a knife at their feet.

573
00:44:45,645 --> 00:44:47,268
I'd say they were starving.

574
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:49,185
And rather than
let his little girl suffer,

575
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,143
he ended it for both of them.

576
00:44:51,144 --> 00:44:53,393
Doesn't matter now.

577
00:44:53,394 --> 00:44:56,186
No, doesn't matter now.

578
00:45:09,936 --> 00:45:12,352
I've known you
a long time, Dondarrion.

579
00:45:12,353 --> 00:45:13,851
Aye.

580
00:45:13,852 --> 00:45:17,935
I think the first time we met
was at that tournament...

581
00:45:17,936 --> 00:45:21,185
And I always thought
you were dull as dirt.

582
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,268
You're not bad.

583
00:45:24,269 --> 00:45:25,644
I don't hate you.

584
00:45:25,645 --> 00:45:28,018
Don't like you,
but you're not bad.

585
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:29,851
Thank you, Clegane.

586
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,185
That warms the heart.

587
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:33,851
But there's nothing
special about you.

588
00:45:33,852 --> 00:45:35,685
You're right about that.

589
00:45:35,686 --> 00:45:39,144
So why does the Lord of Light
keep bringing you back?

590
00:45:40,436 --> 00:45:42,519
I've met better men than you,

591
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:47,435
and they've been hanged from
crossbeams, or beheaded,

592
00:45:47,436 --> 00:45:52,310
or just shat themselves to
death in a field somewhere.

593
00:45:52,311 --> 00:45:55,393
None of them came back.

594
00:45:55,394 --> 00:45:56,976
So, why you?

595
00:45:56,977 --> 00:45:59,893
You think I don't
ask myself that?

596
00:45:59,894 --> 00:46:03,060
Every hour of every day?

597
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:04,728
Why am I here?

598
00:46:06,102 --> 00:46:07,893
What am I supposed to do?

599
00:46:07,894 --> 00:46:09,686
What does the Lord see in me?

600
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,019
And?

601
00:46:14,728 --> 00:46:17,393
I don't know.

602
00:46:17,394 --> 00:46:19,393
I don't understand our Lord.

603
00:46:19,394 --> 00:46:21,227
Your Lord.

604
00:46:21,228 --> 00:46:23,018
I don't know
what He wants from me.

605
00:46:23,019 --> 00:46:27,519
I only know that
He wants me alive.

606
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,811
If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he
just tell you what the fuck he wants?

607
00:46:33,894 --> 00:46:35,685
Clegane.

608
00:46:35,686 --> 00:46:37,061
Come over here.

609
00:46:39,728 --> 00:46:41,436
Don't worry.
The fire won't bite.

610
00:46:42,936 --> 00:46:45,727
I want to show you something.

611
00:46:45,728 --> 00:46:48,936
It's my fucking luck I end up
with a band of fire worshippers.

612
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:51,435
Aye.

613
00:46:51,436 --> 00:46:53,769
Almost seems like
divine justice.

614
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:56,310
There's no divine justice,
you dumb cunt.

615
00:46:56,311 --> 00:46:59,435
If there was, you'd be dead...

616
00:46:59,436 --> 00:47:01,603
and that girl would be alive.

617
00:47:07,977 --> 00:47:10,810
- What do you want?
- Look into the flames.

618
00:47:10,811 --> 00:47:12,935
I don't want to look
in the damn flames.

619
00:47:12,936 --> 00:47:16,478
You saw me bring him back from
the dead after you cut him down.

620
00:47:18,102 --> 00:47:20,352
Don't you want to know
what gave me the power?

621
00:47:20,353 --> 00:47:23,810
I keep asking and no
one wants to tell me.

622
00:47:23,811 --> 00:47:25,310
We can't tell you.

623
00:47:25,311 --> 00:47:27,478
Only the fire can tell you.

624
00:47:40,061 --> 00:47:41,520
What do you see?

625
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:44,727
Logs burning.

626
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:46,811
Keep looking.

627
00:47:52,478 --> 00:47:53,686
What do you see?

628
00:48:03,186 --> 00:48:05,893
Ice.

629
00:48:05,894 --> 00:48:07,811
A wall of ice.

630
00:48:10,228 --> 00:48:11,228
The Wall.

631
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:15,268
What else?

632
00:48:15,269 --> 00:48:19,478
It's where the Wall
meets the sea.

633
00:48:20,686 --> 00:48:22,894
There's a castle there.

634
00:48:30,311 --> 00:48:31,810
There's a mountain.

635
00:48:31,811 --> 00:48:35,269
Looks like an arrowhead.

636
00:48:37,894 --> 00:48:40,061
The dead are marching past.

637
00:48:45,019 --> 00:48:46,852
Thousands of them.

638
00:48:52,977 --> 00:48:54,394
Do you believe me now, Clegane?

639
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:58,019
Do you believe
we're here for a reason?

640
00:49:29,686 --> 00:49:31,269
What the hell
are you doing, Clegane?

641
00:49:34,686 --> 00:49:36,269
Burying the dead.

642
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,477
You knew these people.

643
00:49:51,478 --> 00:49:52,977
Not really.

644
00:50:53,478 --> 00:50:57,310
We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy.

645
00:50:57,311 --> 00:51:00,353
We ask the Mother to...

646
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:05,353
Fuck it, I don't
remember the rest.

647
00:51:11,894 --> 00:51:14,851
I'm sorry you're dead.

648
00:51:14,852 --> 00:51:17,769
You deserved better.

649
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:18,770
Both of you.

650
00:51:42,728 --> 00:51:44,393
Hey.

651
00:51:49,561 --> 00:51:50,976
Mom.

652
00:51:50,977 --> 00:51:52,728
You should really sleep, Sam.

653
00:51:54,186 --> 00:51:55,728
The dead don't.

654
00:52:04,936 --> 00:52:08,102
"Legends of the Long Night."

655
00:52:09,852 --> 00:52:13,101
The Targaryens used dragonglass
to decorate their weapons

656
00:52:13,102 --> 00:52:15,645
without even knowing what
the First Men used it for.

657
00:52:32,936 --> 00:52:33,936
What is it?

658
00:52:35,728 --> 00:52:37,685
It's a map of Dragonstone.

659
00:52:37,686 --> 00:52:39,976
The Targaryens built
their first stronghold there

660
00:52:39,977 --> 00:52:41,770
when they invaded Westeros.

661
00:52:44,478 --> 00:52:46,227
That's dragonglass?

662
00:52:46,228 --> 00:52:47,976
A mountain of it.

663
00:52:47,977 --> 00:52:49,143
Beneath the ground.

664
00:52:49,144 --> 00:52:51,477
Stannis told me,
but I didn't think...

665
00:52:51,478 --> 00:52:54,977
This is important.
Jon needs to know.

666
00:53:48,269 --> 00:53:50,352
Has she come yet?

667
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:51,976
Who?

668
00:53:51,977 --> 00:53:54,185
The Dragon Queen.

669
00:53:54,186 --> 00:53:56,144
Daenerys Stormborn.

670
00:53:57,852 --> 00:53:59,061
Haven't heard anything.

671
00:59:39,144 --> 00:59:40,579
Shall we begin?

672
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:51,544
