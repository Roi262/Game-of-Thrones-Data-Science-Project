1
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,672
A cripple?

2
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,509
You let a cripple escape?

3
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,555
The boy can't walk,
but somehow he slipped past you?

4
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,183
The giant must have took him.

5
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,062
The giant?

6
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,147
Hodor?

7
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,943
Oh, that's all right, then.

8
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,737
You let a halfwit escape with a cripple.

9
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,281
And Rickon, too? The little one?

10
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,867
Gone, along with the wildling woman.

11
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,995
The one you were fucking.

12
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,599
Right.

13
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,977
Get the horses and the hounds.

14
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,858
Come on, find the scent.

15
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,488
Where they going?

16
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,875
Halt!

17
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,172
Enjoying your first hunt?

18
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:38,384
So far, hunting seems
very similar to riding, my lord.

19
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,344
With hunting, there's blood at the end.

20
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,596
They're little boys.

21
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,349
I was a little boy when I was torn away
from my home and brought here.

22
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,644
So I kept my word. I never ran away.

23
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,814
If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them.

24
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,985
Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them.

25
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,530
Those boys are of far more value
to you alive than dead.

26
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,032
They have no value to me missing.

27
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,451
Robb will have sent a force
to retake Winterfell by now.

28
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,871
Robb's in the Riverlands.
My sister's in Deepwood Motte.

29
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,498
She'll get here long before they do.

30
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:14,378
And Ned Stark always said
500 men could hold Winterfell against 10,000.

31
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,881
We have a scent!

32
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,090
The hounds have the scent.

33
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,928
Come, Maester, don't look so grim.

34
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,513
It's all just a game.

35
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:41,989
We should have took more food.

36
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,158
We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.

37
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,869
Those people all love you. They would have
given you whatever you needed.

38
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,246
And if Theon found out, he'd hang them.

39
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,707
- The boy can't survive on walnuts.
- I'm fine.

40
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,212
We've been walking since before sunrise.

41
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,506
- Even Hodor will tire.
- Hodor.

42
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,050
- Even you, sweet giant.
- Hodor.

43
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,348
Wait, I know that farm.

44
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,059
I sent those two Winterfell orphans there.

45
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,144
Jack and Billy.

46
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,981
- They'll give us some food.
- We can't risk it.

47
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:18,859
If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them
until he finds out where we are.

48
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,320
Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.

49
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,072
You've never seen me climb a tree, little man.

50
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,825
They'll be after us with hounds.

51
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,328
We got a good start on them,
but we can't outrun hounds forever.

52
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,440
Did you pull a knife on me in the night?

53
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,785
What's the matter?

54
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,747
Can't be the first time you pressed your bone
against a woman's arse.

55
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,667
Let's move.

56
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,884
It is the first time.

57
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,220
How old are you, boy?

58
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,806
I'm a man of the Night's Watch.

59
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,519
You're a boy who's never been with a girl.

60
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:43,152
Don't your stones start to hurt
if your bone never gets...

61
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,529
Don't call them that.

62
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,531
What, stones?

63
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,659
Or bone?

64
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,369
Neither.

65
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,663
Both.

66
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,793
Move!

67
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:08,427
I heard they get all swollen and bruised
if you don't use them.

68
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:13,015
Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say
when they want me feeling sorry for them.

69
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,059
As if I'd feel sorry for them.

70
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,521
Are there no girl crows?

71
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,942
There are no women of the Night's Watch, no.

72
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,735
So the lads just do it with each other?

73
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,903
No.

74
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,364
- Never?
- Never.

75
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,033
We swore an oath.

76
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,869
You have sheep at the Wall?

77
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,332
With your hands, then?

78
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,001
No wonder you're all so miserable.

79
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,880
- Would you please shut up?
- Would you please shut up?

80
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,926
You think you're better than me, crow.

81
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,303
- I'm a free woman.
- You're a free woman?

82
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,556
I might be your prisoner,
but I'm a free woman.

83
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,143
If you're my prisoner, you're not
a free woman. That's what "prisoner" means.

84
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,145
And you think you're free?

85
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,858
You swore some stupid oath
and now you can never touch a girl.

86
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,152
It was my choice to say the words.

87
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,237
- So you don't like girls?
- Of course I like girls.

88
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,905
But you chose never to touch them.

89
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,867
That's the price you pay
if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.

90
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:16,328
So instead of getting naked with a girl,
you'd prefer to invade our lands...

91
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,038
Invade your lands?

92
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,291
Wildlings raid our lands all the time.

93
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,002
Some of them tried to kill my little brother,
a crippled boy!

94
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,962
They're not your lands!

95
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,173
We've been here the whole time.

96
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,593
You lot came along and just put up a big wall
and said it was yours.

97
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,970
My father was Ned Stark.

98
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,347
I have the blood of the First Men.

99
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,100
My ancestors lived here, same as yours.

100
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,771
So why are you fighting us?

101
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,456
Go on.

102
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,797
Now I want you to tell me
what happened.

103
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,549
Come on, this way.

104
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,638
Come on, speak up. Speak up.

105
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,186
Wolfsbane.

106
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,314
A rare substance.

107
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,525
This is no common assassin.

108
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,861
We hanged 20 men last night.

109
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,239
I don't care if you hanged 100.

110
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,284
A man tried to kill me.
I want his name and I want his head.

111
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:41,205
We think it was an infiltrator from
the Brotherhood Without Banners.

112
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,416
Pretentious name for a band of outlaws.

113
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:49,171
We can't allow rebels behind our lines
to harass us with impunity.

114
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:53,050
We look like fools and they look like heroes.
That's how kings fall.

115
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,219
I want them dead, every one.

116
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,012
Killing them isn't the problem.

117
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:58,973
It's finding them.

118
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,349
Have you gone soft, Clegane?

119
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,435
I always thought you had a talent for violence.

120
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,230
Burn the villages, burn the farms.

121
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,441
Let them know what it means
to choose the wrong side.

122
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,526
Mmm.

123
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,572
Is that mutton?

124
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,324
Yes, my lord.

125
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:18,575
Don't like mutton.

126
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,746
- I'll bring something else.
- Leave it.

127
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,626
- Are you hungry?
- No.

128
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,378
Of course you are.

129
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,130
Eat.

130
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,882
I'll eat in the kitchen later.

131
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,386
It's bad manners to refuse a lord's offer.

132
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,513
Sit.

133
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,683
Eat.

134
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,229
You're small for your age.

135
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,608
I suppose you've been underfed
your whole life.

136
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,860
I eat a lot.

137
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,903
I just don't grow.

138
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,071
Mmm.

139
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,660
This will be my last war.

140
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:04,872
Win or lose.

141
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,625
Have you ever lost before?

142
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,504
Do you think I'd be in my position
if I had lost a war?

143
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,637
But this is the one I'll be remembered for.

144
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,600
The War of Five Kings, they're calling it.

145
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,313
My legacy will be determined
in the coming months.

146
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,650
Do you know what legacy means?

147
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:40,407
It's what you pass down to your children
and your children's children.

148
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,787
It's what remains of you when you're gone.

149
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,627
Harren the Black thought
this castle would be his legacy.

150
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,298
The greatest fortress ever built.

151
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,134
The tallest towers, the strongest walls.

152
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,346
The Great Hall had 35 hearths.

153
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,474
Thirty-five. Can you imagine?

154
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:07,976
Look at it now.

155
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,938
A blasted ruin.

156
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,316
Do you know what happened?

157
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,026
Dragons?

158
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:17,653
Yes.

159
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,155
Dragons happened.

160
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,496
Harrenhal was built to withstand
an attack from the land.

161
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,210
A million men could have
marched on these walls,

162
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,504
and a million men would have been repelled.

163
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,175
But an attack from the air with dragon fire...
Mmm-mmm.

164
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,388
Harren and all his sons
roasted alive within these walls.

165
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,975
Aegon Targaryen changed the rules.

166
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,563
That's why every child alive
still knows his name

167
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,481
300 years after his death.

168
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,733
Aegon and his sisters.

169
00:12:58,653 --> 00:12:59,653
Mmm?

170
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,573
It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon.

171
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,700
It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.

172
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,535
Correct.

173
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,204
A student of history, are you?

174
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,331
Rhaenys rode Meraxes.

175
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,417
Visenya rode Vhagar.

176
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,838
I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.

177
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,883
Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior.

178
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,179
She had a Valyrian steel sword
she called Dark Sister.

179
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,431
Hmm.

180
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,558
She's a heroine of yours, I take it?

181
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,521
Aren't most girls more interested
in the pretty maidens from the songs?

182
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,815
Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?

183
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,775
Most girls are idiots.

184
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,946
You remind me of my daughter.

185
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:49,244
Where did you learn all this stuff about
Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?

186
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,414
From my father.

187
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,085
He was a well-read stonemason.

188
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,757
Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.

189
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,093
Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?

190
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,181
Careful now, girl.

191
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,934
I enjoy you, but be careful.

192
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,520
Take that back to the kitchen.

193
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,480
Eat what you want.

194
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,443
And, girl.

195
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,988
"M'lord. "

196
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,618
Lowborn girls say "m'lord,"

197
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,787
not "my lord. "

198
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,582
If you're going to pose as a commoner,
you should do it properly.

199
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:41,713
My mother served Lady Dustin
for many years, my lord.

200
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,384
She taught me how to speak proper...
Properly.

201
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,348
You're too smart for your own good.
Has anyone told you that?

202
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:52,808
Yes.

203
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,185
Go on.

204
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,657
I beg pardon, ser.

205
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:14,496
I should have come to you after
to thank you for saving me.

206
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,124
- You were so brave.
- Brave?

207
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,711
A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.

208
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,547
Does it give you joy to scare people?

209
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,550
No, it gives me joy to kill people.

210
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,011
Spare me. You can't tell me

211
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,014
Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell
never killed a man.

212
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,891
It was his duty. He never liked it.

213
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,603
Is that what he told you?

214
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:38,854
He lied.

215
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,732
Killing is the sweetest thing there is.

216
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,277
Why are you always so hateful?

217
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,989
You'll be glad of the hateful things I do
someday when you're queen

218
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,326
and I'm all that stands between you
and your beloved king.

219
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:05,380
I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen.
One of them did this or knows who did.

220
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,090
You are one of the Thirteen.

221
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,259
If I wanted your dragons,
I would have taken them.

222
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:12,429
- They mean nothing to me on their own.
- Nothing?

223
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,098
They're more valuable
than anything in the world.

224
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,642
Shall we look inside my vault

225
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,853
and see what selling your dragons
would buy me I cannot buy already?

226
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,938
We will get them back.

227
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:26,693
There is no we,
so why would you help me get them back?

228
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:30,238
I took you under my protection
in front of the rulers of my city.

229
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,658
A man is what others say he is and no more.

230
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:37,788
If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar,
my word is worth nothing.

231
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,291
I cannot let this thing happen to you
under my roof.

232
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,585
But it did happen under your roof.

233
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,047
Khaleesi, many times in my life, I have been...

234
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,757
I don't care where you've been.

235
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:15,784
You think we're savages
because we don't live in stone castles.

236
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,621
We can't make steel as good as yours,
it's true, but...

237
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,373
We're free.

238
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,502
If someone tried to tell us
we couldn't lie down as man and woman,

239
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,796
we'd shove a spear up his arse.

240
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,717
We don't go serving some shit king
who's only king because his father was.

241
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,135
No.

242
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,513
No, you serve Mance Rayder,
the King beyond the Wall.

243
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,974
We chose Mance Rayder to lead us.

244
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:44,020
He was a crow, same as you,
but he wanted to be free.

245
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,858
You could be free, too.

246
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:52,487
You don't need to live your whole life
taking commands from old men.

247
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,198
Wake up when you want to wake up.

248
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,869
I could show you the streams to fish,
the woods to hunt.

249
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:02,289
Build yourself a cabin and
find a woman to lie with in the night.

250
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,209
You're a pretty lad.

251
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,588
The girls would claw each other's eyes out
to get naked with you.

252
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,633
Walk.

253
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,180
I could teach you how to do it.

254
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,348
I know how to do it.

255
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,645
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

256
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,760
And what did she say?

257
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,471
She admired your spirit, Your Grace.

258
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,389
And what then?

259
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,643
She...

260
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:11,399
If every man were held accountable for the
actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton,

261
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,651
we'd all hang.

262
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,156
She tore the paper in half, Your Grace.

263
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,742
You've acted with honor.

264
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,494
I thank you for it.

265
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:27,499
Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's
pen is clean, and give him a hot supper.

266
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,252
Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace.

267
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,420
The prisoners from the Yellow Fork.

268
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,589
Too many prisoners.

269
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,300
Is there room for Ser Alton?

270
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,886
Does he need to lie down?

271
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,766
Have the men build him a new pen.

272
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,561
Put him in with the Kingslayer for now.

273
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,646
Have your boy watch over them.

274
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,439
Torrhen.

275
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,775
That will be all.

276
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,117
Your Grace.

277
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,286
A minute of your time?

278
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,219
I've been treating your wounded men.

279
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:24,973
And my enemies, as some of my bannermen
are fond of mentioning.

280
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,850
They're not my enemies.

281
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,144
That's what I tell my bannermen.

282
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,063
I've already run through the supplies
I brought with me.

283
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:36,276
Some are easily replaced.
Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses.

284
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,612
But some are not.

285
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,156
I need silk for stitching.

286
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,495
I need fennel root for those with fever,
willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy.

287
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,290
You saw what it was like
to amputate a foot without any.

288
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,211
I assume there will be more loss of limb
before this war is over.

289
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,007
- If you need help finding these...
- I know where to find them.

290
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,636
I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you.

291
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,680
Continue, my lady.

292
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,395
You're riding to the Crag
to negotiate a surrender?

293
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,521
Yes.

294
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,775
The Crag will have a maester
and he will have what I need.

295
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,110
I expect he will.

296
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,279
If I could write a list.

297
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:23,198
Come with me to the Crag.

298
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,576
I don't think that will be...

299
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,703
Let the maester show you his stores.

300
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,290
I want the wounded men to be treated well,

301
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,001
all the wounded men.

302
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,303
Children, come inside, quick.
Come on.

303
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,888
Hurry up!

304
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,767
Can't find anything, ser.

305
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,311
- They've lost the scent.
- Try again.

306
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,815
We've circled this farmhouse twice.
There's no sign of them.

307
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,734
We could start the search fresh
in the morning, my lord.

308
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,654
I'm looking at spending the rest of my life

309
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,573
being treated like a fool and a eunuch
by my own people.

310
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:09,536
Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do
to stop that from happening?

311
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,790
The hounds will find the scent again.
I'll beat them until they do.

312
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,377
I'll whip every man here
until I have both those boys in hand.

313
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,130
And once I've got them,
the pampered little shits...

314
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,634
It's better to be cruel than weak.

315
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,177
Prince Theon.

316
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,638
- Where are they?
- Who, m'lord?

317
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,974
The Stark boys. Where are they?

318
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,392
I don't know. I seen no one.

319
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:35,603
Think harder.

320
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:39,399
I swear, m'lord. I don't know.

321
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:42,277
My lord, over here.

322
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,324
I think I've found what we're looking for.

323
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,170
Send the old man home.

324
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,260
Go back to Winterfell.

325
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,012
Take him back.

326
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,641
Theon, don't do this.

327
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,080
- You came back.
- As soon as I heard.

328
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,874
Do you know anything?

329
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,711
- Irri is dead.
- I know.

330
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,048
- She was a good...
- She's dead.

331
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:49,260
She died alone.
She died for me and I couldn't protect her.

332
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,055
Doreah?

333
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,182
We can't find her.

334
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,227
She must be dead, too.

335
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:02,023
I led my people out of the Red Waste
and into the slaughterhouse.

336
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,025
I should have been here.

337
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:06,986
You went to find me a ship.

338
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,864
My place is by your side.

339
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,200
I shouldn't have left you alone
with these people.

340
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,285
"These people"?

341
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,287
They are not to be trusted.

342
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,039
And who is to be trusted?

343
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,708
Who are my people?

344
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,961
The Targaryens?

345
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,838
I only knew one, my brother,

346
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:28,383
and he would have let a thousand men
rape me if it had got him the crown.

347
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,718
The Dothraki?

348
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:34,597
Most of them turned on me the day
that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.

349
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,516
Your people are in Westeros.

350
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,102
The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.

351
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,146
- They will soon enough.
- And then what?

352
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,314
They'll pray for my return?

353
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,733
They'll wave dragon banners
and shout my name?

354
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,154
That's what my brother believed
and he was a fool.

355
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,573
You are not your brother.

356
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,408
Trust me, Khaleesi.

357
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,660
There it is.

358
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,745
"Trust me. "

359
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,082
And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah?

360
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,667
Only you?

361
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,298
I don't need trust any longer.

362
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,885
I don't want it and I don't have room for it.

363
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:16,055
- You are too young to be so...
- And you are too familiar.

364
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,937
Forgive me, Khaleesi.

365
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,902
No one can survive in this world
without help. No one.

366
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,821
Let me help you, please.

367
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,449
Tell me how.

368
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,203
Find my dragons.

369
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,504
How long till we
get back to your crows?

370
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,133
We're close.

371
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,969
What, a day? A half-day?

372
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,726
You don't know, do you?

373
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,230
- Do you even know where they are?
- We're close.

374
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:09,192
What do you think they'll say
when they hear about you and me?

375
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,277
Nothing happened between you and me.

376
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,822
"I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser,

377
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,242
"we were only close together for warmth.

378
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,829
"And then I felt it,
right up against me backside like a club.

379
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,457
"I can show you the bruise on me tailbone.

380
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,752
"And before I knew what was where,
his... his...

381
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,630
"Well, it was all out in the open,
all angry as you like.

382
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:34,384
"And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did!

383
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,679
"And he spread me legs and ruined.

384
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,472
"The shame of it.

385
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,641
"Now I can never marry a perfumed lord.

386
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,352
"What will me poor savage father say?"

387
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:45,687
Turn back around.

388
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,605
"And I thought that we were done,
but he said,

389
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,691
"'Turn back around. "'

390
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:52,860
I'll tell you what, Jon Snow.

391
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,905
Since it's gonna be your word against mine,

392
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,741
and since you can't
talk about it without blushing,

393
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,202
we may as well just...

394
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,455
What, right here in the muck?

395
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,208
I'll keep you warm enough.

396
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,087
Are you that afraid of it?

397
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,172
That's enough.

398
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,882
It's nice

399
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,801
and wet

400
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:18,553
and warm.

401
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:19,887
Enough!

402
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,932
It don't have teeth.

403
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
All right!

404
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,902
All right.

405
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,031
Gods, you're dull.

406
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,611
Should have took me
while you had the chance.

407
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,124
No, no!

408
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,187
No. Oh, no.

409
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,164
It's all right. Give me that.

410
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:14,252
If the Queen sees,
I can have Joffrey's children now.

411
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,003
Help me flip it over.

412
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,565
- Where are you going?
- To tell Her Grace.

413
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,944
You'll say nothing to anyone.

414
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,112
Do you understand?

415
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,636
Your mother might have prepared you.

416
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,722
You flowered, my dear. No more.

417
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:11,392
My mother told me,
but I thought it would be different.

418
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:12,477
In what way?

419
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,438
I thought it would be less...

420
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,065
Less messy.

421
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,277
Wait until you birth a child.

422
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,949
You're a woman now.
Do you have any idea what that means?

423
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:30,036
I'm fit to bear children for the king?

424
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,830
A prospect that once delighted you,

425
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:35,333
bringing little princes and princesses
into the world,

426
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,586
the greatest honor for a queen.

427
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,384
Joffrey has always been difficult.

428
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:50,848
Even his birth, I labored a day and a half
to bring him into this world.

429
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,099
You cannot imagine the pain.

430
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,729
I screamed so loudly, I was sure
Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.

431
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,398
His Grace was not with you?

432
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:00,650
Robert was hunting.

433
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:02,985
That was his custom.

434
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,115
Whenever my time was near,

435
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:15,081
my royal husband would flee to the trees
with his huntsmen and his hounds.

436
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:20,419
And when he returned, he would present me
with some pelts or a stag's head,

437
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,588
and I would present him with a baby.

438
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,385
Not that I wanted him there, mind you.

439
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:31,472
I had Grand Maester Pycelle,
an army of midwives, and I had my brother.

440
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,476
When they told Jaime
he wasn't allowed in the birthing room,

441
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:37,311
he smiled

442
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,648
and asked which one of them
proposed to keep him out.

443
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,612
Joffrey will show you no such devotion.

444
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,534
You may never love the king,

445
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:53,494
but you will love his children.

446
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:56,455
I love His Grace with all my heart.

447
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,667
That's so very touching to hear.

448
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:09,010
Permit me to share some womanly wisdom
with you on this very special day.

449
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,305
The more people you love,
the weaker you are.

450
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,934
You'll do things for them
that you know you shouldn't do.

451
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,771
You'll act the fool to make them happy,
to keep them safe.

452
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,985
Love no one but your children.

453
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,362
On that front, a mother has no choice.

454
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,951
But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?

455
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,372
You can try,

456
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,542
little dove.

457
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,061
Who did you say your mother was again?

458
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,146
Cinda Lannister.

459
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:03,648
Is she the fat one?

460
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,692
Well, perhaps she's
gotten a little larger than she...

461
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:09,987
No, no. There's only one fat Lannister.

462
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,490
If she was your mother, you'd know it.

463
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:17,453
I squired for you once, you know.

464
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,581
When?

465
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,834
The tournament,
the day of Willem Frey's wedding.

466
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,004
I went to Willem Frey's wedding?

467
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,464
You did.

468
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,301
Your squire had gotten so drunk
the night before that he threw up.

469
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:35,971
He threw up on his horse on the way to
the tourney grounds. What was his name?

470
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:38,557
Bryan.

471
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:40,768
Poor lad.

472
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,688
That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall.

473
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,525
I remember you.

474
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,445
You'd never squired for anyone before.

475
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,657
That's right. I ran up and volunteered.
"Let me, my lord. Let me. "

476
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,494
My father was furious.

477
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:03,332
Afraid I'd embarrass our family
in front of the Family.

478
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,794
You didn't, though.

479
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,921
You really remember?

480
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:13,300
You knew when you were needed
and when to go away. It's a rare talent.

481
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,137
Most of my squires,

482
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:20,891
they mean well, but young men with big jobs,
they tend to overdo them.

483
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,811
- When I think back to that day...
- Shh!

484
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,321
You were saying?

485
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:35,865
I...

486
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,952
Never mind. It's embarrassing.

487
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:44,415
More embarrassing than being chained
to a post covered in your own shit?

488
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:48,169
I remember everything about that day,

489
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,379
your helmet, your horse,

490
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,507
the rake lines in the dirt along the list,

491
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:57,595
where the sun was in the sky when
you knocked Balon Swann from his horse,

492
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,514
and the dent in your shield
when you handed it back to me.

493
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:04,727
I'll remember it all until I die.

494
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,023
That was the best day of my life.

495
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:15,738
And I remember being on the field
after it was over.

496
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:19,241
All the competitors were done.
I was the last one out there.

497
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:22,828
And I couldn't leave.

498
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:28,501
I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my
family at a table so far on the edge of the feast

499
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,461
you could barely even see the bride.

500
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:34,590
And I couldn't bear to tell them
what it had been like squiring for you,

501
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,093
when I knew that they could never have
the faintest idea what I was talking about.

502
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,597
I understand completely.

503
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,848
How could you?

504
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,395
Sorry, I... I didn't mean to doubt you.
It's just that I...

505
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,730
I was 16 once.

506
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,610
I also had to replace someone's squire
on short notice.

507
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,237
Which knight was it?

508
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,280
Barristan Selmy.

509
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,536
The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws.
Before your time.

510
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:06,539
What was he like?

511
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,001
He was...

512
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,171
A painter.

513
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,467
A painter who only used red.

514
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:26,892
I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that,
not back then.

515
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:32,106
And to help him do that,
to be a part of something that perfect.

516
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:36,652
I don't need to explain how that felt,
not to you.

517
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,697
It's hard to put into words.

518
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,031
It's like

519
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:45,953
stepping into a dream you've been dreaming
for as long as you can remember,

520
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,955
and finding out that the dream

521
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,249
is more real than your life.

522
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,462
Leaving that battlefield was

523
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,632
like being dragged off to prison.

524
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,969
- Did you squire for him again?
- No.

525
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,597
I didn't have your gift.

526
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,393
He couldn't take a step
without stepping on me.

527
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,353
I was awful, a complete liability.

528
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:19,528
Until one of the outlaws decided
to take on a 16-year-old squire.

529
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,745
It's a good thing I am who I am.

530
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,457
I'd have been useless at anything else.

531
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:39,465
I'm not well-suited for imprisonment.

532
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,008
Shocking, I know.

533
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:42,843
Some men are.

534
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,803
Ned Stark,

535
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:49,475
I imagine he made an excellent prisoner
right up until the end.

536
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,602
Not me, though.

537
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,814
My life has left me
uniquely unfit for constraint.

538
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,569
And have you thought about...

539
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:02,404
Of course. Every day.

540
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,281
And?

541
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:10,079
Good prisoners breed good jailers,
apparently.

542
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,247
The Starks are very careful.

543
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,210
But there is a way, I think.

544
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,297
It wasn't possible until now.

545
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,716
What is it?

546
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:31,058
- It's actually quite simple.
- Well, let me help you.

547
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,560
You'll only have to do one thing.

548
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:34,979
Tell me.

549
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,067
You'll have to die.

550
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,205
Jorah the Andal.

551
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,084
This man must sail past old Valyria.

552
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,630
All who travel too close to the doom
must have protection.

553
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,549
I didn't come here for lessons.

554
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,885
No, you came for the dragons.

555
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:49,595
You have them?

556
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,931
Where are they?

557
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,808
Draw your sword.

558
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,479
See what your steel is worth.

559
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:04,193
You want to please the Mother of Dragons.

560
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,201
You love her.

561
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,706
Where are the dragons?

562
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,585
Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?

563
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,009
Will you betray her again?

564
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:32,888
Never.

565
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,896
The thief you seek

566
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,732
is with her now.

567
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:52,783
I did not leave the comfort of my home
to come to yours and be called a thief.

568
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,701
No one is calling you a thief.

569
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:56,578
Who is she to accuse us?

570
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:59,790
Please, they're my children. I'm begging you.

571
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:03,669
Begging us? It wasn't very long ago
you were threatening us.

572
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:06,046
Without me, the dragons will die.

573
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:07,881
It will be for the best.

574
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:12,970
Your dragons will bring the world
nothing but death and misery, my dear.

575
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,848
If I knew where they were,
I would not tell you.

576
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,599
You are cruel, my friend.

577
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,602
The Mother of Dragons is in the right.

578
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,647
She must be reunited with her babies.

579
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,734
- I will help you, Khaleesi.
- How?

580
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:32,906
I will take you to the House of the Undying
where I have put them.

581
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,493
You have my dragons?

582
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:41,540
When I learned you were coming to our city,
I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth.

583
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,002
He procured them for me.

584
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,588
But there is no King of Qarth.

585
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,090
There is now.
That was the other half of the arrangement.

586
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:58,432
You would keep your gates and your minds
closed to everything outside your walls,

587
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:03,604
but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city
that ever was if it refuses to change.

588
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:08,609
I will open Qarth to the world
as I have forced it to open itself to me.

589
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,446
Your ambition is an inspiration.

590
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,283
But like all upstarts, you overreach.

591
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:21,580
Three dragons the size of cats
and an alliance with a charlatan

592
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,582
do not make you a king.

593
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,043
An upstart and a charlatan?

594
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:28,503
Empires have been built by less.

595
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,050
Those on the margins
often come to control the center,

596
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:36,887
and those in the center make room for them,
willingly or otherwise.

597
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,478
The Mother of Dragons
will be with her babies.

598
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,775
She will give them her love
and they will thrive by her side,

599
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:54,863
forever.

600
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,135
A mother should be with her children.

601
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,849
Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn?

602
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,770
Your dragons wait for you
in the House of the Undying.

603
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,689
Come see them.

604
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,908
- Lady Stark!
- No farther.

605
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,952
Keep your hands off me, woman.

606
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:45,163
Don't enter without an invitation, man.

607
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,750
Forgive me. Lady Stark.

608
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:51,420
What is it?
- They caught the Kingslayer.

609
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,592
Kingslayer!

610
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,761
- Kill the fucking Kingslayer! Hang him!
- Hang him!

611
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,059
You'll die today.

612
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,936
Justice for the Karstark.

613
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:22,659
Gut him!

614
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,758
Get back! I want his head!

615
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:43,972
Any man who stands between a father
and his vengeance asks for death.

616
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:45,557
Lord Karstark,

617
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:48,769
this man is our prisoner.

618
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,146
This monster killed my son.

619
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,773
And crippled mine.

620
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:57,027
He will answer for his crimes,
I promise you, but not here.

621
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,446
I will have his head.
And if you try and stop me...

622
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,947
You will strike me down?

623
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,909
Have you forgotten me, ser?

624
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,828
I am the widow of your liege,
Lord Eddard Stark.

625
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,205
I am the mother of your king!

626
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,624
- And where is our king now?
- You know very well.

627
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,918
He has gone to the Crag
to accept the surrender.

628
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:16,463
Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate.

629
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:19,466
- He brought that foreign bitch with him.
- How dare you!

630
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,552
- Threatening my lady is an act of treason.
- Treason?

631
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,763
How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?

632
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:28,392
I understand your grief, my lord,
better than most, I understand it.

633
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:32,521
But in the name of my son,
the King in the North,

634
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,022
stand down.

635
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:39,778
When your son returns,
I will demand this murderer's head.

636
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:42,322
Wise men do not make demands of kings.

637
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,825
Fathers who love their sons do.

638
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:47,327
I will have his head.

639
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,958
Thank you for fighting on my behalf,
Lady Stark.

640
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:55,252
I would have come to your defense, but...

641
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,587
Take him to the stockades.

642
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,589
Bind him with every chain you can find!

643
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,716
You've become a real she-wolf
in your later years.

644
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,802
There's not much fish left in you.

645
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,303
And gag him!

646
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,311
Since when do you light your own candles?

647
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:18,358
Since I decided that I can't stand to look at
any of my handmaidens for another instant.

648
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:23,196
How many times
can you read one raven scroll?

649
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:29,786
Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted
sailing north past Tarth, 200 ships.

650
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:33,290
- More than we have.
- Yes, that's more than we have.

651
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:37,961
He'll be at our gates within five days,
four if he has the wind.

652
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,172
We have strong, high walls.

653
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,592
We'll rain fire down on them from above.

654
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:48,054
"Rain fire on them from above. "
You're quoting Father, aren't you?

655
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,514
Why not?

656
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,349
He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?

657
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,144
Call it tactics, not strategy.

658
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,480
But, yes, he does have a good mind for it.

659
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:59,774
The best mind, some would say.
Sadly, he's not here.

660
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,111
It's just you, me and Joffrey,

661
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:07,240
the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

662
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,911
I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.

663
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,580
He needs to start acting like a king.

664
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:17,167
This war you started
is coming to our doorstep.

665
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,794
And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead...

666
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:22,214
I'm not the one
giving the boy whores to abuse.

667
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,508
I thought the girls might help him.

668
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,468
- Did you?
- I was wrong.

669
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,765
If we can't control him...

670
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,642
Do you think I haven't tried?

671
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,188
He doesn't listen to me.

672
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:45,946
It's hard to put a leash on a dog
once you've put a crown on its head.

673
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,160
I always hoped he'd be like Jaime.

674
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:55,705
He looks like him.

675
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,461
In a certain light.

676
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:06,925
The boy is more Robert than Jaime.

677
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:10,470
Robert was a drunken fool,
but he didn't enjoy cruelty.

678
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,308
Sometimes I wonder.

679
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,227
What?

680
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,647
If this is the price

681
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,567
for what we've done,

682
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,777
for our sins.

683
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:27,654
Sins?

684
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,031
The Targaryens...

685
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,784
Wed brother and sister
for hundreds of years, I know.

686
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:38,999
That's what Jaime and I would say
to each other in our moments of doubt.

687
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,586
It's what I told Ned Stark
when he was stupid enough to confront me.

688
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,799
Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they?

689
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:49,467
What's the saying?

690
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:52,679
"Every time a Targaryen is born,
the Gods flip a coin. "

691
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,265
You've beaten the odds.

692
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,853
Tommen and Myrcella are good,
decent children, both of them.

693
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,635
Then why wait?
We're sworn to the king.

694
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:34,054
- There's not a king.
- That's treason.

695
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:36,139
So is saving Lannisters, yeah?

696
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,058
- Back off, you.
- No, I won't.

697
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,728
Your son returns at dawn, my lady?

698
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,271
So they say.

699
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,106
The Kingslayer won't last the night.

700
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,818
The more they drink, the angrier they'll get.

701
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:51,946
And when the Karstarks draw their swords...

702
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,241
Who wants to die defending a Lannister?

703
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:57,744
Come.

704
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,960
He'll not be making it through the night.

705
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,304
I need to be alone with him.

706
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:20,141
- My lady, our orders...
- Your orders, which I just gave you,

707
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,519
are to leave me alone with him.

708
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:29,776
Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark?

709
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:33,446
I believe it's my last night in this world.

710
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:36,074
Is that a woman?

711
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,493
Do you hear them out there?

712
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:40,787
They want your head.

713
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:45,375
Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.

714
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,294
You strangled his son with your chains.

715
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,130
Oh. Oh.

716
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:52,340
Was he the one on guard duty?

717
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,678
He was in my way.

718
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:59,806
- Any knight would have done the same.
- You are no knight.

719
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:03,226
You have forsaken every vow you ever took.

720
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,811
So many vows.

721
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:06,813
They make you swear and swear.

722
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:11,151
Defend the king, obey the king,
obey your father,

723
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:14,154
protect the innocent, defend the weak.

724
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:17,532
But what if your father despises the king?

725
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:21,661
What if the king massacres the innocent?

726
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:23,788
It's too much.

727
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,959
No matter what you do,
you're forsaking one vow or another.

728
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,587
Where did you find this beast?

729
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:34,758
She is a truer knight than you will ever be,

730
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:38,470
- Kingslayer.
- Kingslayer.

731
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,056
What a king he was.

732
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,769
Here's to Aerys Targaryen,
the Second of His Name,

733
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,897
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
Protector of the Realm,

734
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,150
and to the sword I shoved in his back.

735
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,654
You are a man without honor.

736
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,241
Do you know,

737
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:03,703
I've never been with any woman but Cersei.

738
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,955
So in my own way,

739
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,666
I have more honor than

740
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,170
poor old dead Ned.

741
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,216
What was the name of
that bastard he fathered?

742
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,343
- Brienne.
- No, that wasn't it.

743
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:23,139
Snow, a bastard from the North.

744
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:29,270
Now, when... When good old Ned
came home with some whore's baby,

745
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:32,023
did you pretend to love it?

746
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:34,734
No.

747
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:37,570
You're not very good at pretending.

748
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:39,614
You're an honest woman.

749
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:42,826
You hated that boy, didn't you?

750
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,787
How could you not hate him?

751
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,248
The walking, talking reminder

752
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:52,043
that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark

753
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,045
fucked another woman.

754
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,508
Your sword.

755
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,349
I told you what would happen.

756
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,269
All of you.

757
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,898
I told you what would happen
if you served me loyally.

758
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,527
And what would happen if you did not.

759
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,655
What are you doing? What have you done?

760
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:24,576
If there are any who still question
whether your new lord means what he says,

761
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,455
here is the answer to your question.

762
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,968
No!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
