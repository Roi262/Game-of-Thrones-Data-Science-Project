1
00:00:07,053 --> 00:00:08,810
Come and get her.

2
00:00:16,588 --> 00:00:20,128
It's an invitation...
to King's Landing.

3
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:21,628
You will represent my interests

4
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:23,253
at this gathering
as you see them.

5
00:00:23,254 --> 00:00:25,713
It's not safe leaving you
with Littlefinger.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,421
She's your sister.

7
00:00:27,796 --> 00:00:29,212
Arya would never betray
her family.

8
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:31,941
She would if she
thought I was going to betray Jon.

9
00:00:35,045 --> 00:00:37,129
With the faces,
I can become someone else.

10
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:41,713
I wonder what it would feel like
to be the Lady of Winterfell.

11
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:47,588
All I'd need to find out...
is your face.

12
00:00:51,045 --> 00:00:52,545
Daenerys will win this war.

13
00:00:52,546 --> 00:00:54,003
If you want Cersei
to bend the knee,

14
00:00:54,004 --> 00:00:55,004
you can ask her yourself.

15
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:57,045
She has
a more important request.

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,587
Cersei thinks the army
of the dead is nothing

17
00:00:59,588 --> 00:01:01,879
but a story.
What if we prove her wrong?

18
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:04,044
Bring the dead to her.

19
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:11,462
Go!

20
00:01:17,421 --> 00:01:19,920
We are going to destroy
the Night King and his army.

21
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:22,254
Thank you, my queen.

22
00:04:21,254 --> 00:04:23,461
- Oil?
- Pitch, my lord.

23
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:26,004
- How many barrels?
- 500, my lord.

24
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:30,086
Get 500 more.

25
00:04:30,087 --> 00:04:31,087
Yes, my lord.

26
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:46,503
I still enjoy it
when they call me "my lord."

27
00:04:46,504 --> 00:04:48,961
The thrill will fade.

28
00:04:48,962 --> 00:04:50,462
If we live that long.

29
00:04:51,962 --> 00:04:53,670
Men without cocks.

30
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:55,378
You wouldn't find me
fighting in an army

31
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,336
if I had no cock.

32
00:04:57,337 --> 00:04:59,795
What's left
to fight for?

33
00:04:59,796 --> 00:05:01,670
Gold?

34
00:05:01,671 --> 00:05:03,503
I spent my life
around soldiers.

35
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,629
What do you think
they spend that gold on?

36
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,837
Family.

37
00:05:08,838 --> 00:05:10,504
Not without a cock,
you don't.

38
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,671
Maybe it really is
all cocks in the end.

39
00:05:16,754 --> 00:05:20,044
Yet, your brother has chosen
to side with the cockless.

40
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:24,919
Yes, he's always been
a champion of the downtrodden.

41
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,879
I think we're about to be
the downtrodden.

42
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:10,295
Archers, stand tall!

43
00:06:10,296 --> 00:06:13,254
Cover that wall!

44
00:06:40,713 --> 00:06:44,295
- How many people live here?
- A million, give or take.

45
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:48,420
That's more people than the
entire North crammed into that.

46
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:50,587
Why would anyone
want to live that way?

47
00:06:50,588 --> 00:06:53,044
There's more work
in the city.

48
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,254
And the brothels
are far superior.

49
00:07:33,588 --> 00:07:35,628
Why isn't she with them?

50
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:37,795
I'm afraid I don't know,
Your Grace.

51
00:07:37,796 --> 00:07:39,961
No one has seen her.

52
00:07:39,962 --> 00:07:41,628
And the rest of them?

53
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,878
They're on their way
to the Dragonpit now.

54
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,170
Including our brother?

55
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:47,962
Yes, Your Grace.

56
00:07:52,296 --> 00:07:53,795
If anything goes wrong,

57
00:07:53,796 --> 00:07:55,837
kill the silver-haired
bitch first,

58
00:07:55,838 --> 00:07:59,128
then our brother, then the
bastard who calls himself king.

59
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:02,170
The rest of them you can kill
in any order you see fit.

60
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:04,961
Come, Ser Gregor.

61
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:07,129
It's time for us
to meet our guests.

62
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,044
Why did they build it?

63
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:19,670
Dragons don't understand
the difference

64
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:21,878
between what is theirs
and what isn't.

65
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:25,545
Land, livestock,
children...

66
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:28,086
Letting them roam free
around a city was a problem.

67
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:31,878
I imagine it was
a sad joke at the end.

68
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,336
An entire arena for a few sickly
creatures smaller than dogs.

69
00:08:35,337 --> 00:08:38,837
But in the beginning, when it
was home to Balerion the Dread,

70
00:08:38,838 --> 00:08:42,212
it must have been the most
dangerous place in the world.

71
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:50,546
Maybe it still is.

72
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:00,546
Welcome, my lords.

73
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:06,587
Your friends arrived
before you did.

74
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,462
I've been sent to escort
you all to the meeting.

75
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,919
A pleasant surprise
in an unpleasant situation.

76
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,587
I never thought I'd see
you again, my lord.

77
00:09:38,588 --> 00:09:40,128
Supporting the enemy,
no less.

78
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:42,879
- Hard to blame you.
- Cersei will anyway.

79
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,587
I'm glad you're alive.

80
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:46,837
Come on!

81
00:09:46,838 --> 00:09:48,296
You can suck
his magic cock later.

82
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,337
What's in there?

83
00:09:58,671 --> 00:10:00,129
Fuck off.

84
00:10:09,796 --> 00:10:11,461
I thought
you were dead.

85
00:10:11,462 --> 00:10:13,628
Not yet.

86
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:15,962
You came pretty close.

87
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:19,920
I was only trying
to protect her.

88
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:23,211
You and me both.

89
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:25,128
She's alive.

90
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:26,296
Arya.

91
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,170
- Where?
- Winterfell.

92
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,169
Who's protecting her
if you're here?

93
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,670
The only one
that needs protecting

94
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,004
is the one that gets
in her way.

95
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,546
It won't be me.

96
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:49,753
Here we are...

97
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:52,295
the heroes of Blackwater Bay.

98
00:10:52,296 --> 00:10:53,878
Strange place for a reunion.

99
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,753
It is, my lord.

100
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:58,837
I don't think I'm anyone's
lord anymore, Podrick.

101
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:01,420
Save the titles for
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

102
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:04,336
I'm sure your new queen will
be happy to restore yours

103
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:05,795
if she ends up
on the throne.

104
00:11:05,796 --> 00:11:07,919
You've been thinking
about our new queen?

105
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,253
Perhaps you've been
reconsidering your allegiances.

106
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,295
Remember my offer...

107
00:11:14,296 --> 00:11:17,712
whatever they're paying you,
I'll pay double.

108
00:11:17,713 --> 00:11:20,253
And that would be
double what now, exactly?

109
00:11:20,254 --> 00:11:22,795
Don't you worry about me.
I'm doing all right.

110
00:11:22,796 --> 00:11:25,128
- Looking after myself.
- Are you?

111
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:26,587
Helping me to arrange
this meeting

112
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:29,044
wasn't exactly looking
after yourself, was it?

113
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:30,837
You put yourself
at risk.

114
00:11:30,838 --> 00:11:33,712
I put yourself at risk.
Important difference.

115
00:11:33,713 --> 00:11:37,211
It's your head Queen Cersei's offered
a bag of gold for, it's not mine.

116
00:11:37,212 --> 00:11:39,003
Now, thanks to me,

117
00:11:39,004 --> 00:11:42,211
she's got two traitors' heads
coming right through her door.

118
00:11:42,212 --> 00:11:44,670
She can lop them both off
as soon as she gets tired

119
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,545
of the clever words that
pour out their pieholes.

120
00:11:47,546 --> 00:11:50,753
All thanks to Ser Bronn
of the fucking Blackwater.

121
00:11:50,754 --> 00:11:54,045
If that's not looking after
myself, I don't know what is.

122
00:11:55,754 --> 00:11:57,087
It's good
to see you again.

123
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:01,546
Yeah, you, too.

124
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:14,254
Anyone touches it,
I'll kill you first.

125
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:13,919
Come on, Pod.

126
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,420
Let's you and me
go have a drink

127
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:16,962
while the fancy folks
talk, eh?

128
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,003
I left this shit city

129
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:50,837
because I didn't
want to die in it.

130
00:13:50,838 --> 00:13:53,129
Am I going to die
in this shit city?

131
00:13:54,212 --> 00:13:55,295
You might.

132
00:13:55,296 --> 00:13:58,712
And this is all
your idea.

133
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:02,044
Seems every bad idea has some
Lannister cunt behind it.

134
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:05,211
And some Clegane cunt
to help them see it through.

135
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,919
Remember me?

136
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,837
Yeah, you do.

137
00:15:08,838 --> 00:15:12,919
You're even fucking
uglier than I am now.

138
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,421
What did they do
to you?

139
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:18,753
Doesn't matter.

140
00:15:18,754 --> 00:15:20,961
That's not how it ends
for you, brother.

141
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:24,211
You know who's
coming for you.

142
00:15:24,212 --> 00:15:26,296
You've always known.

143
00:15:40,838 --> 00:15:41,838
Where is she?

144
00:15:43,254 --> 00:15:44,378
She'll be here soon.

145
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:45,629
Didn't travel with you?

146
00:15:47,504 --> 00:15:48,504
No.

147
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:45,420
We've been here
for some time.

148
00:17:45,421 --> 00:17:47,713
My apologies.

149
00:17:57,004 --> 00:17:58,670
We are all facing a unique...

150
00:17:58,671 --> 00:18:00,712
Theon!

151
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,628
I have your sister.

152
00:18:02,629 --> 00:18:05,045
If you don't submit
to me here, now...

153
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:07,838
I'll kill her.

154
00:18:13,588 --> 00:18:16,044
I think we ought to begin
with larger concerns.

155
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:18,253
Then why
are you talking?

156
00:18:18,254 --> 00:18:20,462
You're the smallest
concern here.

157
00:18:22,087 --> 00:18:24,712
Do you remember when we
discussed dwarf jokes?

158
00:18:24,713 --> 00:18:26,461
His wasn't even good.

159
00:18:26,462 --> 00:18:27,795
He explained it
at the end.

160
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:29,336
Never explain.
It always ruins it.

161
00:18:29,337 --> 00:18:30,837
We don't even
let your kind live

162
00:18:30,838 --> 00:18:34,044
in the Iron Islands,
you know?

163
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:36,253
We kill you at birth.

164
00:18:36,254 --> 00:18:38,295
An act of mercy
for the parents.

165
00:18:38,296 --> 00:18:40,961
Perhaps you ought
to sit down.

166
00:18:40,962 --> 00:18:42,420
Why?

167
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,629
Sit down or leave.

168
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:08,837
We are a group of people
who do not like one another,

169
00:19:08,838 --> 00:19:11,379
as this recent
demonstration has shown.

170
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:15,169
We have suffered
at each other's hands.

171
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,545
We have lost people we love
at each other's hands.

172
00:19:18,546 --> 00:19:20,837
If all we wanted
was more of the same,

173
00:19:20,838 --> 00:19:23,086
there would be no need
for this gathering.

174
00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:26,128
We are entirely capable of
waging war against each other

175
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:27,837
without meeting
face-to-face.

176
00:19:27,838 --> 00:19:29,712
So instead, we should
settle our differences

177
00:19:29,713 --> 00:19:32,378
and live together in harmony
for the rest of our days?

178
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,795
We all know
that will never happen.

179
00:19:33,796 --> 00:19:35,170
Then why are we here?

180
00:19:37,504 --> 00:19:40,546
This isn't about
living in harmony.

181
00:19:42,045 --> 00:19:43,837
It's just
about living.

182
00:19:43,838 --> 00:19:46,420
The same thing
is coming for all of us.

183
00:19:46,421 --> 00:19:48,461
A general you can't
negotiate with.

184
00:19:48,462 --> 00:19:52,211
An army that doesn't leave corpses
behind on the battlefield.

185
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:55,795
Lord Tyrion tells me a million
people live in this city.

186
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:59,211
They're about to become a million more
soldiers in the Army of the Dead.

187
00:19:59,212 --> 00:20:01,920
I imagine for most of them
it would be an improvement.

188
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:07,504
This is serious.

189
00:20:08,962 --> 00:20:10,670
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't.

190
00:20:10,671 --> 00:20:12,503
I don't think
it's serious at all.

191
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:13,961
I think it's
another bad joke.

192
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,712
If my brother Jaime
has informed me correctly,

193
00:20:16,713 --> 00:20:18,336
you're asking me
for a truce.

194
00:20:18,337 --> 00:20:20,879
Yes.
That's all.

195
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,962
That's all?

196
00:20:25,337 --> 00:20:26,919
Pull back my armies
and stand down

197
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,628
while you go
on your monster hunt.

198
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:31,211
Or while you solidify
and expand your position.

199
00:20:31,212 --> 00:20:35,587
Hard for me to know which it
is with my armies pulled back

200
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:39,253
until you return and march on my
capital with four times the men.

201
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:43,588
Your capital will be safe until the
northern threat is dealt with.

202
00:20:45,004 --> 00:20:46,295
You have my word.

203
00:20:46,296 --> 00:20:48,420
The word of
a would-be usurper.

204
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:50,420
There is no conversation

205
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:54,461
that will erase
the last 50 years.

206
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,671
We have something
to show you.

207
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,754
We can destroy them
by burning them.

208
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:27,754
And we can destroy them
with dragonglass.

209
00:23:29,796 --> 00:23:31,587
If we don't win
this fight,

210
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:35,588
then that is the fate
of every person in the world.

211
00:23:53,254 --> 00:23:55,461
There is only one war
that matters...

212
00:23:55,462 --> 00:23:57,796
the Great War.

213
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,296
And it is here.

214
00:24:04,504 --> 00:24:06,629
I didn't believe
it until I saw them.

215
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,296
I saw them all.

216
00:24:13,004 --> 00:24:14,211
How many?

217
00:24:14,212 --> 00:24:15,629
A hundred thousand,
at least.

218
00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:33,838
Can they swim?

219
00:24:35,004 --> 00:24:36,128
No.

220
00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:37,504
Good.

221
00:24:39,254 --> 00:24:42,003
I'm taking the Iron Fleet
back to the Iron Islands.

222
00:24:42,004 --> 00:24:44,086
What are you
talking about?

223
00:24:44,087 --> 00:24:46,003
I've been
around the world.

224
00:24:46,004 --> 00:24:48,378
I've seen everything,
things you couldn't imagine,

225
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:49,838
and this...

226
00:24:52,212 --> 00:24:55,629
this is the only thing I've
ever seen that terrifies me.

227
00:25:02,962 --> 00:25:04,878
I'm going back
to my island.

228
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:07,545
You should go
back to yours.

229
00:25:07,546 --> 00:25:09,503
When winter's over,

230
00:25:09,504 --> 00:25:12,170
we'll be the only ones
left alive.

231
00:25:21,629 --> 00:25:23,671
He's right to be afraid.

232
00:25:24,962 --> 00:25:26,628
And a coward to run.

233
00:25:26,629 --> 00:25:28,878
If those things
come for us,

234
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:30,795
there will be
no kingdoms to rule.

235
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:33,211
Everything we suffered
will have been for nothing.

236
00:25:33,212 --> 00:25:36,004
Everything we lost
will have been for nothing.

237
00:25:37,754 --> 00:25:39,546
The crown accepts
your truce.

238
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:45,920
Until the dead are defeated,
they are the true enemy.

239
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:57,754
In return, the King in the
North will extend this truce.

240
00:25:59,962 --> 00:26:01,961
He will remain in the North
where he belongs.

241
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:03,878
He will not take up arms
against the Lannisters.

242
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:06,295
He will not
choose sides.

243
00:26:06,296 --> 00:26:08,587
Just the
King in the North?

244
00:26:08,588 --> 00:26:11,044
Not me?

245
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:13,670
I would never
ask it of you.

246
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:15,253
You would never
agree to it.

247
00:26:15,254 --> 00:26:17,754
And if you did, I would trust
you even less than I do now.

248
00:26:19,087 --> 00:26:22,003
I ask it only
of Ned Stark's son.

249
00:26:22,004 --> 00:26:25,546
I know Ned Stark's son
will be true to his word.

250
00:26:39,796 --> 00:26:42,503
I am true to my word.

251
00:26:42,504 --> 00:26:44,254
Or I try to be.

252
00:26:47,379 --> 00:26:49,962
That is why I cannot
give you what you ask.

253
00:26:51,296 --> 00:26:53,962
I cannot serve
two queens.

254
00:26:56,337 --> 00:26:57,753
And I have already
pledged myself

255
00:26:57,754 --> 00:27:01,504
to Queen Daenerys
of House Targaryen.

256
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:15,211
Then there is
nothing left to discuss.

257
00:27:15,212 --> 00:27:18,211
The dead will come north first.
Enjoy dealing with them.

258
00:27:18,212 --> 00:27:20,212
We will deal with
whatever is left of you.

259
00:27:28,671 --> 00:27:30,336
Ser Jaime.

260
00:27:30,337 --> 00:27:31,795
It's been good
to see you.

261
00:27:31,796 --> 00:27:33,795
I imagine the next time
will be across a battlefield.

262
00:27:33,796 --> 00:27:35,378
We both saw
what just happened.

263
00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:37,128
We both saw
that... thing.

264
00:27:37,129 --> 00:27:39,919
Yes, and I'm not looking forward
to seeing more of them.

265
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,587
But I'm loyal
to the queen,

266
00:27:41,588 --> 00:27:43,503
and you're loyal to Sansa
and her dolt brother.

267
00:27:43,504 --> 00:27:45,628
Oh, fuck loyalty!

268
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:47,169
Fuck loyalty?

269
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:50,712
This goes beyond houses
and honor and oaths.

270
00:27:50,713 --> 00:27:52,212
Talk to the queen.

271
00:27:57,838 --> 00:27:59,212
And tell her what?

272
00:28:10,045 --> 00:28:11,713
I wish you
hadn't done that.

273
00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:18,878
I'm grateful
for your loyalty,

274
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:22,961
but my dragon died
so that we could be here.

275
00:28:22,962 --> 00:28:25,378
If it's all for nothing,

276
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:27,545
then he died
for nothing.

277
00:28:27,546 --> 00:28:29,044
I know!

278
00:28:29,045 --> 00:28:31,712
I'm pleased you bent
the knee to our queen.

279
00:28:31,713 --> 00:28:34,420
I would have advised
it, had you asked.

280
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,378
But have you
ever considered

281
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:38,587
learning how to lie
every now and then?

282
00:28:38,588 --> 00:28:39,588
Just a bit?

283
00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:43,962
I'm not going to swear
an oath I can't uphold.

284
00:28:45,337 --> 00:28:46,919
Talk about my father
if you want,

285
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,003
tell me that's the attitude
that got him killed.

286
00:28:50,004 --> 00:28:53,086
But when enough people
make false promises,

287
00:28:53,087 --> 00:28:56,253
words stop meaning
anything.

288
00:28:56,254 --> 00:28:59,420
Then there are no more answers,
only better and better lies.

289
00:28:59,421 --> 00:29:02,169
And lies won't help us
in this fight.

290
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,253
That is indeed a problem.

291
00:29:04,254 --> 00:29:07,796
The more immediate problem
is that we're fucked.

292
00:29:09,004 --> 00:29:10,420
Any ideas
as to how we might

293
00:29:10,421 --> 00:29:12,421
change that state
of affairs?

294
00:29:13,796 --> 00:29:15,253
Only one.

295
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,670
Everyone stays here,

296
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:20,461
and I go and talk
to my sister.

297
00:29:20,462 --> 00:29:24,878
I didn't come all this way
to have my Hand murdered.

298
00:29:24,879 --> 00:29:26,670
I don't want Cersei
to murder me either.

299
00:29:26,671 --> 00:29:29,670
I could have stayed in my cell and
saved a great deal of trouble.

300
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:31,712
I did this.

301
00:29:31,713 --> 00:29:34,211
- I should go.
- She'll definitely murder you.

302
00:29:34,212 --> 00:29:37,588
I go see
my sister alone.

303
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:40,587
Or we all go home

304
00:29:40,588 --> 00:29:42,337
and we're right back
where we started.

305
00:30:44,212 --> 00:30:48,545
- You spoke with her?
- At her until she kicked me out.

306
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:51,628
She thinks I was an
idiot to trust you.

307
00:30:51,629 --> 00:30:53,753
A lot of people seem to
think that, actually.

308
00:30:53,754 --> 00:30:55,378
I'm about to step
into a room

309
00:30:55,379 --> 00:30:57,169
with the most murderous
woman in the world

310
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:01,086
who's already tried to kill
me twice, that I know of.

311
00:31:01,087 --> 00:31:02,713
Who's an idiot?

312
00:31:06,129 --> 00:31:08,587
I suppose we should
say goodbye,

313
00:31:08,588 --> 00:31:10,170
one idiot to another.

314
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:11,003
I shouldn't be
surprised, I suppose.

315
00:32:11,004 --> 00:32:12,795
She's your kind of woman...

316
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:15,336
a foreign whore who
doesn't know her place.

317
00:32:15,337 --> 00:32:19,128
A foreign whore you can't
abduct, beat, or intimidate.

318
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:20,837
That must be
difficult for you.

319
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:23,295
So you bring her here
with her pet Northerner,

320
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,211
- whom you've convinced to bow down before her.
- I didn't know about that.

321
00:32:25,212 --> 00:32:27,295
And now you've got them both
working towards the same goal,

322
00:32:27,296 --> 00:32:29,420
the goal you've worked
towards your entire life...

323
00:32:29,421 --> 00:32:32,503
- Cersei, I didn't know.
- ...the destruction of this family.

324
00:32:32,504 --> 00:32:35,837
I am the one preventing
that from happening.

325
00:32:35,838 --> 00:32:38,378
Daenerys didn't want
to debate and negotiate.

326
00:32:38,379 --> 00:32:39,837
She didn't want
to bring you words.

327
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:41,795
She wanted to bring you
fire and blood

328
00:32:41,796 --> 00:32:43,919
until I advised her
otherwise.

329
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,712
I don't want
to destroy our family.

330
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,670
I never have.

331
00:32:47,671 --> 00:32:49,128
You killed our father.

332
00:32:49,129 --> 00:32:50,753
After he sentenced me
to death

333
00:32:50,754 --> 00:32:53,336
for a crime I didn't
commit, yes, I killed him.

334
00:32:53,337 --> 00:32:55,003
Hate me for it
if you want.

335
00:32:55,004 --> 00:32:57,336
I hate myself for it
in spite of what he was,

336
00:32:57,337 --> 00:32:59,795
in spite of
what he did to me.

337
00:32:59,796 --> 00:33:01,545
Oh, poor little man.

338
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,253
Your papa
was mean to you.

339
00:33:03,254 --> 00:33:07,295
Do you have any idea what you did
when you fired that crossbow?

340
00:33:07,296 --> 00:33:09,128
You left us open.

341
00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:10,712
You laid us bare
for the vultures,

342
00:33:10,713 --> 00:33:14,253
and the vultures came
and tore us apart.

343
00:33:14,254 --> 00:33:15,919
You may not
have killed Joffrey,

344
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,837
but you killed Myrcella,
you killed Tommen.

345
00:33:17,838 --> 00:33:19,878
No one would've touched them
if Father was here.

346
00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:22,461
- No one would have dared...
- I have never been more sorry about anything.

347
00:33:22,462 --> 00:33:24,169
I will not hear it,
not from you.

348
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,920
I will not hear it!

349
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:31,211
All right.

350
00:33:31,212 --> 00:33:32,670
You love your family,

351
00:33:32,671 --> 00:33:35,753
and I have
destroyed it.

352
00:33:35,754 --> 00:33:38,503
I will always
be a threat.

353
00:33:38,504 --> 00:33:39,838
So put an end to me.

354
00:33:48,671 --> 00:33:50,878
If it weren't for me,
you'd have a mother.

355
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:53,628
If it weren't for me,
you'd have a father.

356
00:33:53,629 --> 00:33:54,961
If it weren't for me,

357
00:33:54,962 --> 00:33:57,044
you'd have
two beautiful children.

358
00:33:57,045 --> 00:33:59,211
I've thought
about killing you

359
00:33:59,212 --> 00:34:00,879
more times
than I can count.

360
00:34:02,588 --> 00:34:04,879
Do it!
Say the word.

361
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:16,795
I am more sorry about the children
than you could ever know.

362
00:35:16,796 --> 00:35:19,961
- I will not...
- I don't care. I loved them.

363
00:35:19,962 --> 00:35:21,837
You know I did.

364
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:25,337
You know it in your heart if
there's anything left of it.

365
00:35:27,462 --> 00:35:29,170
It doesn't matter.

366
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,753
Your love doesn't matter.
Your feelings don't matter.

367
00:35:34,754 --> 00:35:36,919
I don't care
why you did what you did.

368
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,795
I only care
what it cost us.

369
00:35:39,796 --> 00:35:41,170
It cost us our future.

370
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:44,961
If there's no future,
then why are we here?

371
00:35:44,962 --> 00:35:46,961
Why did you
allow me to come?

372
00:35:46,962 --> 00:35:50,003
Not to help my enemies
collaborate in my destruction.

373
00:35:50,004 --> 00:35:51,753
Yes, no,
not what you hoped for,

374
00:35:51,754 --> 00:35:54,296
but you must have
hoped for something.

375
00:35:55,337 --> 00:35:57,878
What did you hope for?

376
00:35:57,879 --> 00:36:01,545
- To make Jon Snow submit to your queen?
- Mm, not like this.

377
00:36:01,546 --> 00:36:03,919
But eventually, you want everyone
to bend the knee to her.

378
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,670
- Yes.
- Why?

379
00:36:05,671 --> 00:36:07,253
Because I think

380
00:36:07,254 --> 00:36:09,086
she will make the world
a better place.

381
00:36:09,087 --> 00:36:11,004
You said she'd destroy
King's Landing.

382
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,128
She knows herself.

383
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:16,670
She chose an advisor

384
00:36:16,671 --> 00:36:20,003
who would check her worst
impulses instead of feeding them.

385
00:36:20,004 --> 00:36:22,003
That's the difference
between you.

386
00:36:22,004 --> 00:36:24,211
I don't care about
checking my worst impulses.

387
00:36:24,212 --> 00:36:26,837
I don't care about making
the world a better place.

388
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:28,628
Hang the world.

389
00:36:28,629 --> 00:36:31,086
That thing
you dragged here,

390
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:34,545
I know what it is,
I know what it means.

391
00:36:34,546 --> 00:36:36,753
And when it came at me,
I didn't think about the world.

392
00:36:36,754 --> 00:36:38,837
Not at all.

393
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:40,420
As soon as
it opened its mouth,

394
00:36:40,421 --> 00:36:41,795
the world
disappeared for me,

395
00:36:41,796 --> 00:36:43,919
right down
its black throat.

396
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,295
All I could think about was
keeping those gnashing teeth

397
00:36:46,296 --> 00:36:47,837
away from the ones
who matter most,

398
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,628
away from my family.

399
00:36:49,629 --> 00:36:53,253
Maybe Euron Greyjoy
had the right idea.

400
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:56,044
Get on a boat,
take those who matter...

401
00:36:56,045 --> 00:36:57,212
You're pregnant.

402
00:37:29,671 --> 00:37:32,378
No one is less happy
about this than I am.

403
00:37:32,379 --> 00:37:33,796
I know.

404
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,961
I respect
what you did.

405
00:37:38,962 --> 00:37:41,296
Wish you hadn't done it,
but I respect it.

406
00:37:51,962 --> 00:37:55,462
This place was the beginning
of the end for my family.

407
00:38:01,671 --> 00:38:03,796
A dragon
is not a slave.

408
00:38:06,629 --> 00:38:09,086
They were terrifying.

409
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:10,796
Extraordinary.

410
00:38:12,212 --> 00:38:15,253
They filled people
with wonder and awe,

411
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:17,504
and we locked them
in here.

412
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,337
They wasted away.

413
00:38:21,546 --> 00:38:23,837
They grew small.

414
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:26,462
And we grew small
as well.

415
00:38:27,796 --> 00:38:30,378
We weren't extraordinary
without them.

416
00:38:30,379 --> 00:38:32,212
We were just like
everyone else.

417
00:38:37,254 --> 00:38:39,170
You're not like
everyone else.

418
00:38:45,045 --> 00:38:47,504
And your family
hasn't seen its end.

419
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:50,295
You're still here.

420
00:38:50,296 --> 00:38:52,837
I can't
have children.

421
00:38:52,838 --> 00:38:54,420
Who told you that?

422
00:38:54,421 --> 00:38:57,378
The witch who
murdered my husband.

423
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:59,587
Has it occurred to you
she might not have been

424
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:01,379
a reliable source
of information?

425
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:09,336
You were right
from the beginning.

426
00:39:09,337 --> 00:39:12,546
If I had trusted you,
everything would be different.

427
00:39:16,629 --> 00:39:18,045
So, what now?

428
00:39:21,962 --> 00:39:24,545
I can't forget what I saw
north of the Wall.

429
00:39:24,546 --> 00:39:26,461
And I can't pretend
that Cersei

430
00:39:26,462 --> 00:39:29,754
won't take back half the country
the moment I march north.

431
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:34,379
It appears Tyrion's
assessment was correct.

432
00:39:36,796 --> 00:39:37,879
We're fucked.

433
00:40:31,045 --> 00:40:33,129
My armies will not
stand down.

434
00:40:34,588 --> 00:40:36,671
I will not pull them
back to the capital.

435
00:40:40,462 --> 00:40:43,962
I will march them north to fight
alongside you in the Great War.

436
00:40:46,045 --> 00:40:47,962
The darkness
is coming for us all.

437
00:40:49,754 --> 00:40:52,712
We'll face it together.

438
00:40:52,713 --> 00:40:55,503
And when
the Great War is over,

439
00:40:55,504 --> 00:40:58,837
perhaps you'll remember
I chose to help

440
00:40:58,838 --> 00:41:02,296
with no promises or
assurances from any of you.

441
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,713
I expect not.

442
00:41:10,129 --> 00:41:11,878
Call our banners.

443
00:41:11,879 --> 00:41:13,379
All of them.

444
00:41:26,379 --> 00:41:29,628
It's not easy for
ravens to fly in these storms.

445
00:41:29,629 --> 00:41:31,628
Perhaps Jon tried
to send word earlier.

446
00:41:31,629 --> 00:41:35,044
No, this is
the way he is,

447
00:41:35,045 --> 00:41:37,420
the way
he's always been.

448
00:41:37,421 --> 00:41:40,044
He never asked for my opinion.
Why would he start now?

449
00:41:40,045 --> 00:41:43,795
I can't believe he'd surrender the
Northern crown without consulting you.

450
00:41:43,796 --> 00:41:46,211
This is his writing,
his signature.

451
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:49,378
He pledged to fight
for Daenerys Targaryen.

452
00:41:49,379 --> 00:41:51,461
He's bent the knee.

453
00:41:51,462 --> 00:41:54,044
I've heard gossip

454
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:58,044
that the Dragon Queen
is quite beautiful.

455
00:41:58,045 --> 00:42:00,254
What does that have to do
with anything?

456
00:42:02,546 --> 00:42:05,295
Jon is young
and unmarried.

457
00:42:05,296 --> 00:42:07,503
Daenerys is young
and unmarried.

458
00:42:07,504 --> 00:42:10,461
You think he wants
to marry her?

459
00:42:10,462 --> 00:42:13,712
An alliance
makes sense.

460
00:42:13,713 --> 00:42:15,920
Together, they'd be
difficult to defeat.

461
00:42:17,546 --> 00:42:20,546
He was named
King in the North.

462
00:42:22,962 --> 00:42:24,379
He can be unnamed.

463
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,878
Even if I wanted to,
Arya would never go along.

464
00:42:30,879 --> 00:42:33,712
She always loved Jon far
more than she ever loved me,

465
00:42:33,713 --> 00:42:36,919
and she'd kill anyone
who betrayed her family.

466
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,920
You are family, too.

467
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,503
Would Arya really murder
her own sister?

468
00:42:43,504 --> 00:42:45,837
Do you know
what she is now?

469
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:49,211
Do you know what
the Faceless Men are?

470
00:42:49,212 --> 00:42:51,420
Only by reputation.

471
00:42:51,421 --> 00:42:54,587
They worship the God
of Death, I believe.

472
00:42:54,588 --> 00:42:57,211
I never trust
godly men.

473
00:42:57,212 --> 00:42:58,712
They're killers.

474
00:42:58,713 --> 00:43:00,588
And Arya
was one of them.

475
00:43:05,462 --> 00:43:07,044
What do you think
she's after?

476
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:09,628
She's your sister.

477
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:11,754
You know her far better
than I ever could.

478
00:43:15,296 --> 00:43:20,044
Sometimes when I try to
understand a person's motives,

479
00:43:20,045 --> 00:43:21,962
I play a little game.

480
00:43:24,462 --> 00:43:26,462
I assume the worst.

481
00:43:29,462 --> 00:43:32,295
What's the worst reason
they could possibly have

482
00:43:32,296 --> 00:43:37,253
for saying what they say
and doing what they do?

483
00:43:37,254 --> 00:43:39,461
Then I ask myself,

484
00:43:39,462 --> 00:43:42,628
"How well does
that reason explain

485
00:43:42,629 --> 00:43:45,588
what they say
and what they do?"

486
00:43:47,421 --> 00:43:48,961
So, tell me...

487
00:43:48,962 --> 00:43:51,504
what's the worst thing
she could want?

488
00:43:56,337 --> 00:43:59,336
She could
want me dead

489
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:02,545
because she thinks
I wronged my family.

490
00:44:02,546 --> 00:44:04,838
Why did she come
to Winterfell?

491
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:10,003
To kill me

492
00:44:10,004 --> 00:44:13,837
for marrying our enemies
and betraying my family.

493
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:16,838
Why did she unearth the
letter Cersei made you write?

494
00:44:19,546 --> 00:44:23,628
To provide proof
of my betrayals.

495
00:44:23,629 --> 00:44:28,378
To provide justification
after she murders me.

496
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:32,044
And after
she murders you,

497
00:44:32,045 --> 00:44:34,713
what does she become?

498
00:44:40,212 --> 00:44:41,920
Lady of Winterfell.

499
00:44:56,962 --> 00:44:59,878
If we have the Dothraki
ride hard on the kingsroad,

500
00:44:59,879 --> 00:45:02,545
they'll arrive at Winterfell
within the fortnight.

501
00:45:02,546 --> 00:45:04,044
And the Unsullied?

502
00:45:04,045 --> 00:45:05,670
We can sail with them
to White Harbor,

503
00:45:05,671 --> 00:45:08,378
meet the Dothraki here
on the kingsroad,

504
00:45:08,379 --> 00:45:11,336
then ride together
to Winterfell.

505
00:45:11,337 --> 00:45:14,587
Perhaps you should fly
to Winterfell, Your Grace.

506
00:45:14,588 --> 00:45:17,086
You have many enemies
in the North.

507
00:45:17,087 --> 00:45:19,336
Thousands fell
fighting your father.

508
00:45:19,337 --> 00:45:23,044
All it takes is one angry
man with a crossbow.

509
00:45:23,045 --> 00:45:25,253
He'll see your silver
hair on the kingsroad

510
00:45:25,254 --> 00:45:28,295
and know that one well-placed
bolt will make him a hero.

511
00:45:28,296 --> 00:45:30,920
The man who killed
the conqueror.

512
00:45:32,462 --> 00:45:34,253
It's your decision,
Your Grace.

513
00:45:34,254 --> 00:45:37,461
But if we're going to be
allies in this war,

514
00:45:37,462 --> 00:45:41,545
it's important for the
Northerners to see us as allies.

515
00:45:41,546 --> 00:45:44,712
If we sail
to White Harbor together,

516
00:45:44,713 --> 00:45:46,962
I think it sends
a better message.

517
00:45:53,421 --> 00:45:56,169
I've not come
to conquer the North.

518
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,504
I'm coming to save
the North.

519
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:05,462
We sail together.

520
00:46:20,629 --> 00:46:21,629
Jon.

521
00:46:23,796 --> 00:46:25,129
Can I speak
with you?

522
00:46:28,462 --> 00:46:29,588
All right.

523
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:38,044
What you did
in King's Landing,

524
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,170
what you said...

525
00:46:42,337 --> 00:46:45,753
you could've
lied to Cersei

526
00:46:45,754 --> 00:46:48,671
about bending the knee
to Daenerys.

527
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:55,129
You risked everything
to tell an enemy the truth.

528
00:46:57,045 --> 00:46:59,503
We went down there
to make peace.

529
00:46:59,504 --> 00:47:03,003
And it seems to me we need
to be honest with each other

530
00:47:03,004 --> 00:47:04,379
if we're going
to fight together.

531
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,379
You've always known
what was right.

532
00:47:11,879 --> 00:47:15,169
Even when we were all
young and stupid,

533
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:16,670
you always knew.

534
00:47:16,671 --> 00:47:18,920
Every step you take...

535
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,253
it's always
the right step.

536
00:47:22,254 --> 00:47:23,378
It's not.

537
00:47:23,379 --> 00:47:25,628
It may seem that way
from the outside,

538
00:47:25,629 --> 00:47:29,045
but I promise you,
it's not true.

539
00:47:31,462 --> 00:47:34,044
I've done plenty of
things that I regret.

540
00:47:34,045 --> 00:47:35,753
Not compared to me, you haven't.

541
00:47:35,754 --> 00:47:37,379
No.

542
00:47:39,212 --> 00:47:41,004
Not compared to you.

543
00:47:52,254 --> 00:47:54,879
I always wanted
to do the right thing.

544
00:47:57,546 --> 00:47:59,628
Be the right
kind of person.

545
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:02,212
But I never knew
what that meant.

546
00:48:03,629 --> 00:48:05,962
It always seemed
like there's...

547
00:48:10,045 --> 00:48:12,462
like there was an impossible
choice I had to make.

548
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,713
Stark or Greyjoy.

549
00:48:19,962 --> 00:48:24,587
Our father was more of a father
to you than yours ever was.

550
00:48:24,588 --> 00:48:27,420
- He was.
- And you betrayed him.

551
00:48:27,421 --> 00:48:29,295
Betrayed his memory.

552
00:48:29,296 --> 00:48:30,296
I did.

553
00:48:35,296 --> 00:48:37,045
But you never
lost him.

554
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,004
He's a part of you.

555
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,295
Just like
he's a part of me.

556
00:48:46,296 --> 00:48:48,462
But the things
I've done...

557
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:52,920
It's not my place to
forgive you for all of it.

558
00:48:56,296 --> 00:48:59,503
But what I can
forgive,

559
00:48:59,504 --> 00:49:00,920
I do.

560
00:49:07,296 --> 00:49:09,462
You don't need
to choose.

561
00:49:10,796 --> 00:49:12,754
You're a Greyjoy...

562
00:49:14,962 --> 00:49:16,296
and you're a Stark.

563
00:49:30,004 --> 00:49:32,919
When I was
Ramsay's prisoner,

564
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,961
Yara tried
to save me.

565
00:49:36,962 --> 00:49:40,503
She's the only one

566
00:49:40,504 --> 00:49:42,462
who tried to save me.

567
00:49:49,546 --> 00:49:51,712
She needs me now.

568
00:49:51,713 --> 00:49:54,504
So, why are you
still talking to me?

569
00:50:08,754 --> 00:50:10,211
Load up.

570
00:50:10,212 --> 00:50:11,837
Load up, lads.
Go on.

571
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:14,170
Tide's coming in.

572
00:50:30,296 --> 00:50:32,879
All of us chose
to follow Yara.

573
00:50:35,337 --> 00:50:39,169
We left the Iron
Islands for Yara.

574
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:42,004
She would never
leave one of us behind.

575
00:50:44,879 --> 00:50:46,587
We're not
leaving her behind.

576
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:48,044
Your sister's dead.

577
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,753
- She's not dead.
- She's dead.

578
00:50:49,754 --> 00:50:52,628
Even if Euron hasn't cut her
throat yet, she's dead.

579
00:50:52,629 --> 00:50:57,753
- She's our queen.
- She's your sister, and you left her to die.

580
00:50:57,754 --> 00:50:59,254
I did.

581
00:51:01,629 --> 00:51:04,503
I ran from my uncle.

582
00:51:04,504 --> 00:51:05,919
I was a coward.

583
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,169
So, why in fuck's name
should we listen to you?

584
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:12,795
They say the dead
can't swim.

585
00:51:12,796 --> 00:51:14,378
We're going
to sail east,

586
00:51:14,379 --> 00:51:16,753
find a nice,
quiet island,

587
00:51:16,754 --> 00:51:19,753
kill all the men, and take
their wives for ourselves.

588
00:51:19,754 --> 00:51:22,169
- We're done with all that.
- Who says we are?

589
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:25,087
Yara did.
She made a pledge.

590
00:51:27,004 --> 00:51:30,169
We're going
to find her,

591
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,962
and we're going
to set her free.

592
00:51:41,421 --> 00:51:44,503
Run away,
little Theon.

593
00:51:44,504 --> 00:51:46,462
It's what
you do best.

594
00:51:49,504 --> 00:51:51,295
He needs to shut his mouth.

595
00:51:58,129 --> 00:52:01,004
Hey!

596
00:52:03,045 --> 00:52:07,253
Oh, yes!

597
00:52:07,254 --> 00:52:10,004
That's more like it.

598
00:52:26,879 --> 00:52:27,879
Stay down...

599
00:52:29,129 --> 00:52:30,629
or I'll kill you!

600
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:44,671
I said stay down
or I'll kill you!

601
00:53:57,588 --> 00:53:59,254
Not for me.

602
00:54:02,546 --> 00:54:04,003
For Yara!

603
00:54:04,004 --> 00:54:05,421
Yara!

604
00:54:51,004 --> 00:54:53,462
Have my sister brought
to the Great Hall.

605
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,713
Are you sure
you want to do this?

606
00:55:43,546 --> 00:55:46,795
It's not what I want.
It's what honor demands.

607
00:55:46,796 --> 00:55:49,712
And what does honor demand?

608
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:52,587
That I defend my family
from those who would harm us.

609
00:55:52,588 --> 00:55:56,212
That I defend the North from
those who would betray us.

610
00:55:58,462 --> 00:56:00,170
All right, then.

611
00:56:01,588 --> 00:56:02,879
Get on with it.

612
00:56:05,713 --> 00:56:07,878
You stand accused
of murder.

613
00:56:07,879 --> 00:56:10,712
You stand accused
of treason.

614
00:56:10,713 --> 00:56:13,504
How do you answer
these charges...

615
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,754
Lord Baelish?

616
00:56:33,504 --> 00:56:35,045
My sister asked you
a question.

617
00:56:39,754 --> 00:56:41,254
Lady Sansa,
forgive me...

618
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,712
I'm a bit confused.

619
00:56:44,713 --> 00:56:47,003
Which charges
confuse you?

620
00:56:47,004 --> 00:56:49,044
Let's start with
the simplest one...

621
00:56:49,045 --> 00:56:51,628
you murdered our aunt,
Lysa Arryn.

622
00:56:51,629 --> 00:56:54,503
You pushed her through the Moon
Door and watched her fall.

623
00:56:54,504 --> 00:56:56,379
Do you deny it?

624
00:56:58,421 --> 00:56:59,919
I did it
to protect you.

625
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,961
You did it to take
power in the Vale.

626
00:57:01,962 --> 00:57:05,253
Earlier, you conspired
to murder Jon Arryn.

627
00:57:05,254 --> 00:57:07,753
You gave Lysa Tears of Lys
to poison him.

628
00:57:07,754 --> 00:57:08,796
Do you deny it?

629
00:57:11,129 --> 00:57:14,295
Whatever your aunt
might have told you...

630
00:57:14,296 --> 00:57:16,629
she was
a troubled woman.

631
00:57:17,962 --> 00:57:19,253
She imagined enemies
everywhere.

632
00:57:19,254 --> 00:57:21,628
You had Aunt Lysa send
a letter to our parents

633
00:57:21,629 --> 00:57:24,128
telling them it was the
Lannisters who murdered Jon Arryn

634
00:57:24,129 --> 00:57:25,628
when, really,
it was you.

635
00:57:25,629 --> 00:57:27,837
The conflict between
the Starks and the Lannisters,

636
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:29,336
it was you
who started it.

637
00:57:29,337 --> 00:57:30,420
Do you deny it?

638
00:57:30,421 --> 00:57:32,044
I know
of no such letter.

639
00:57:32,045 --> 00:57:33,878
You conspired
with Cersei Lannister

640
00:57:33,879 --> 00:57:37,587
and Joffrey Baratheon to
betray our father, Ned Stark.

641
00:57:37,588 --> 00:57:40,128
Thanks to your treachery,
he was imprisoned

642
00:57:40,129 --> 00:57:43,587
and later executed on
false charges of treason.

643
00:57:43,588 --> 00:57:46,420
- Do you deny it?
- I deny it!

644
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:49,795
None of you were there
to see what happened.

645
00:57:49,796 --> 00:57:51,753
None of you
knows the truth.

646
00:57:51,754 --> 00:57:53,671
You held a knife
to his throat.

647
00:57:58,879 --> 00:58:01,504
You said, "I did warn
you not the trust me."

648
00:58:04,838 --> 00:58:09,504
You told our mother this knife
belonged to Tyrion Lannister.

649
00:58:10,838 --> 00:58:12,712
But that was another
one of your lies.

650
00:58:12,713 --> 00:58:14,546
It was yours.

651
00:58:19,671 --> 00:58:22,587
Lady Sansa, I have known
you since you were a girl.

652
00:58:22,588 --> 00:58:25,253
- I've protected you.
- Protected me?

653
00:58:25,254 --> 00:58:27,379
By selling me
to the Boltons?

654
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:31,044
If we could
speak alone,

655
00:58:31,045 --> 00:58:32,588
I can explain
everything.

656
00:58:34,796 --> 00:58:37,919
Sometimes when I'm trying to
understand a person's motives,

657
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,503
I play a little game.

658
00:58:40,504 --> 00:58:42,170
I assume the worst.

659
00:58:43,546 --> 00:58:45,461
What's the worst
reason you have

660
00:58:45,462 --> 00:58:47,379
for turning me
against my sister?

661
00:58:49,212 --> 00:58:51,295
That's what you do,
isn't it?

662
00:58:51,296 --> 00:58:53,128
That's what
you've always done...

663
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:54,961
turn family
against family,

664
00:58:54,962 --> 00:58:56,878
turn sister
against sister.

665
00:58:56,879 --> 00:58:59,086
That's what you did
to our mother and Aunt Lysa,

666
00:58:59,087 --> 00:59:01,295
and that's what
you tried to do to us.

667
00:59:01,296 --> 00:59:02,628
Sansa, please.

668
00:59:02,629 --> 00:59:06,461
I'm a slow learner,
it's true.

669
00:59:06,462 --> 00:59:07,919
But I learn.

670
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,169
Give me a chance
to defend myself.

671
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:11,462
I deserve that.

672
00:59:17,296 --> 00:59:18,878
I am Lord Protector
of the Vale

673
00:59:18,879 --> 00:59:21,253
and I command you to escort
me safely back to the Eyrie.

674
00:59:21,254 --> 00:59:22,546
I think not.

675
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:28,546
Sansa, I beg you!

676
00:59:30,045 --> 00:59:32,086
I loved your mother since
the time I was a boy.

677
00:59:32,087 --> 00:59:33,879
And yet,
you betrayed her.

678
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,086
I loved you.

679
00:59:39,087 --> 00:59:40,713
More than anyone.

680
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:43,629
And yet,
you betrayed me.

681
00:59:46,254 --> 00:59:48,003
When you brought me
back to Winterfell,

682
00:59:48,004 --> 00:59:50,545
you told me there's no
justice in the world,

683
00:59:50,546 --> 00:59:52,754
not unless
we make it.

684
00:59:54,754 --> 00:59:59,169
Thank you for all your many
lessons, Lord Baelish.

685
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:01,462
I will never
forget them.

686
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:06,170
Sansa!

687
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:14,296
I...

688
01:00:37,379 --> 01:00:38,837
Our men in King's Landing

689
01:00:38,838 --> 01:00:40,503
will march north
in three days' time.

690
01:00:40,504 --> 01:00:41,878
It'll take us a fortnight

691
01:00:41,879 --> 01:00:43,211
just to gather supplies
for the train.

692
01:00:43,212 --> 01:00:44,753
We don't
have a fortnight.

693
01:00:44,754 --> 01:00:46,753
If the North falls, we fall.
Three days.

694
01:00:46,754 --> 01:00:48,295
The remaining forces
in the Westerlands

695
01:00:48,296 --> 01:00:50,003
will take
the river road east.

696
01:00:50,004 --> 01:00:51,545
We'll meet at
Lord Harroway's Town

697
01:00:51,546 --> 01:00:53,545
and march together
to Winterfell.

698
01:00:53,546 --> 01:00:54,713
Ser Jaime.

699
01:00:55,838 --> 01:00:57,211
Your Grace.

700
01:00:57,212 --> 01:00:59,671
My lords, I need a
moment with my brother.

701
01:01:01,296 --> 01:01:03,129
Your Grace.

702
01:01:06,337 --> 01:01:10,169
- What are you doing?
- Preparing the expedition north.

703
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:12,753
Expedition north?

704
01:01:12,754 --> 01:01:16,044
I always knew you were
the stupidest Lannister.

705
01:01:16,045 --> 01:01:18,712
The Starks and Targaryens
have united against us,

706
01:01:18,713 --> 01:01:20,837
and you want to fight
alongside them?

707
01:01:20,838 --> 01:01:22,795
Are you a traitor
or an idiot?

708
01:01:22,796 --> 01:01:24,753
You pledged our forces
to fight our common enemy...

709
01:01:24,754 --> 01:01:26,211
I'll say whatever
I need to say

710
01:01:26,212 --> 01:01:27,919
to ensure the survival
of our house.

711
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,670
You expect me to trust the
man who murdered our father?

712
01:01:30,671 --> 01:01:34,253
You expect me to command our troops
to fight beside foreign scum,

713
01:01:34,254 --> 01:01:35,753
to fight for
the Dragon Queen?

714
01:01:35,754 --> 01:01:37,670
You saw it
with your own eyes.

715
01:01:37,671 --> 01:01:40,044
You saw a dead man
trying to kill us.

716
01:01:40,045 --> 01:01:41,878
I saw it burn.

717
01:01:41,879 --> 01:01:43,712
If dragons
can't stop them,

718
01:01:43,713 --> 01:01:46,753
if Dothraki and Unsullied
and Northmen can't stop them,

719
01:01:46,754 --> 01:01:48,753
how will our armies
make a difference?

720
01:01:48,754 --> 01:01:50,753
This isn't about
noble houses,

721
01:01:50,754 --> 01:01:52,878
this is about
the living and the dead!

722
01:01:52,879 --> 01:01:54,919
And I intend to stay
amongst the living.

723
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,128
Let the Stark boy and his
new queen defend the North.

724
01:01:58,129 --> 01:02:00,336
We stay here
where we've always been.

725
01:02:00,337 --> 01:02:02,879
I made a promise.

726
01:02:05,045 --> 01:02:08,461
Our child
will rule Westeros.

727
01:02:08,462 --> 01:02:13,336
Our child will never be born
if the dead come south.

728
01:02:13,337 --> 01:02:14,919
The monsters are real.

729
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,044
The white walkers,

730
01:02:17,045 --> 01:02:19,295
the dragons,
the Dothraki screamers...

731
01:02:19,296 --> 01:02:23,295
all the frightening stories we heard
when we were young, they're all real.

732
01:02:23,296 --> 01:02:25,003
So be it.

733
01:02:25,004 --> 01:02:27,128
Let the monsters
kill each other.

734
01:02:27,129 --> 01:02:29,378
And while they battle
in the North,

735
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:31,795
we take back the lands
that belong to us.

736
01:02:31,796 --> 01:02:34,587
- And then what?
- And then we rule.

737
01:02:34,588 --> 01:02:37,503
When the fighting in the
North is over, someone wins.

738
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:39,670
You understand that,
don't you?

739
01:02:39,671 --> 01:02:43,169
If the dead win, they march
south and kill us all.

740
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:46,253
If the living win,
and we've betrayed them,

741
01:02:46,254 --> 01:02:48,211
they march south
and kill us all!

742
01:02:48,212 --> 01:02:51,211
The Targaryens and the Starks
already want to kill us all.

743
01:02:51,212 --> 01:02:52,628
Most of them
will die in the North.

744
01:02:52,629 --> 01:02:54,211
I faced them
in the field.

745
01:02:54,212 --> 01:02:56,753
We can't beat them.
We can't beat their dragons.

746
01:02:56,754 --> 01:02:58,295
How many dragons
did you see at the pit?

747
01:02:58,296 --> 01:03:00,295
- Two.
- What happened to the third?

748
01:03:00,296 --> 01:03:02,795
For all we know,
it's guarding her fleet!

749
01:03:02,796 --> 01:03:06,128
She came here with her dragons and
her Dothraki and her Unsullied.

750
01:03:06,129 --> 01:03:08,919
She came here to show us
all her power.

751
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:11,961
No, something happened.
The dragons are vulnerable.

752
01:03:11,962 --> 01:03:14,503
We can't beat the Dothraki.
We don't have the numbers.

753
01:03:14,504 --> 01:03:16,336
We don't have the support
of the other houses!

754
01:03:16,337 --> 01:03:19,004
No, we have something better.
We have the Iron Bank.

755
01:03:21,004 --> 01:03:24,961
You should've listened more when Father
spoke about the importance of gold.

756
01:03:24,962 --> 01:03:27,128
Oh, I know
it's boring for you.

757
01:03:27,129 --> 01:03:30,753
You just wanted to hunt
and ride and fight.

758
01:03:30,754 --> 01:03:33,336
But I listened,
I learned.

759
01:03:33,337 --> 01:03:37,336
Highgarden bought us the most
powerful army in Essos...

760
01:03:37,337 --> 01:03:39,128
the Golden Company.

761
01:03:39,129 --> 01:03:42,837
20,000 men, horses,
elephants, I believe.

762
01:03:42,838 --> 01:03:44,503
The Golden Company
is not here.

763
01:03:44,504 --> 01:03:45,878
They're in Essos.

764
01:03:45,879 --> 01:03:49,837
How is a mercenary company
in Essos going to help us?

765
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:52,336
Do you really think
Euron Greyjoy turned tail

766
01:03:52,337 --> 01:03:53,962
and sailed back
to the Iron Islands?

767
01:03:55,087 --> 01:03:56,461
Do you think
he abandoned

768
01:03:56,462 --> 01:03:59,712
the chance to marry
the queen?

769
01:03:59,713 --> 01:04:02,045
No one walks away
from me.

770
01:04:03,879 --> 01:04:05,545
He's sailing with
his fleet to Essos.

771
01:04:05,546 --> 01:04:07,628
He's going to ferry
the Golden Company back here

772
01:04:07,629 --> 01:04:09,170
to help us win
the war for Westeros.

773
01:04:11,713 --> 01:04:14,878
You plotted with Euron
Greyjoy without telling me,

774
01:04:14,879 --> 01:04:16,712
the commander
of your armies?

775
01:04:16,713 --> 01:04:19,336
And you conspired
with Tyrion,

776
01:04:19,337 --> 01:04:20,712
the man who murdered
our father,

777
01:04:20,713 --> 01:04:22,044
without telling me,
your queen.

778
01:04:22,045 --> 01:04:23,503
I didn't conspire
with him.

779
01:04:23,504 --> 01:04:25,378
You met with him in secret
without my consent.

780
01:04:25,379 --> 01:04:27,378
You planned to promote
my enemies' interests.

781
01:04:27,379 --> 01:04:29,670
That is the definition
of conspiracy.

782
01:04:29,671 --> 01:04:32,044
I pledged
to ride north.

783
01:04:32,045 --> 01:04:33,878
I intend to honor
that pledge.

784
01:04:33,879 --> 01:04:36,086
- And that will be treason.
- Treason?

785
01:04:36,087 --> 01:04:38,336
Disobeying your queen's command,
fighting with her enemies.

786
01:04:38,337 --> 01:04:39,671
What would you
call it?

787
01:04:41,671 --> 01:04:43,546
Doesn't matter
what I'd call it.

788
01:04:50,504 --> 01:04:53,254
I told you no one
walks away from me.

789
01:04:55,588 --> 01:04:58,129
Are you going to
order him to kill me?

790
01:05:00,254 --> 01:05:02,211
I'm the only one
you have left.

791
01:05:02,212 --> 01:05:04,670
Our children are gone,
our father is gone.

792
01:05:04,671 --> 01:05:06,420
It's just
me and you now.

793
01:05:06,421 --> 01:05:08,421
There's one more
yet to come.

794
01:05:11,421 --> 01:05:13,421
Give the order, then.

795
01:05:32,796 --> 01:05:34,504
I don't
believe you.

796
01:07:22,421 --> 01:07:24,920
Come in.

797
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,378
Samwell Tarly.

798
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:32,587
I wasn't sure
if you'd remember me.

799
01:07:32,588 --> 01:07:34,421
I remember everything.

800
01:07:42,588 --> 01:07:44,753
You helped us
get beyond the Wall.

801
01:07:44,754 --> 01:07:47,295
- You're a good man.
- Oh, well, thank you,

802
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:49,920
but, um, I'm not sure
that I am.

803
01:07:54,087 --> 01:07:56,254
What happened to you
beyond the Wall?

804
01:07:57,671 --> 01:07:59,254
I became
the Three-Eyed Raven.

805
01:08:00,879 --> 01:08:01,962
Oh!

806
01:08:05,254 --> 01:08:07,628
I don't know
what that means.

807
01:08:07,629 --> 01:08:10,378
I can see things
that happened in the past.

808
01:08:10,379 --> 01:08:14,461
I can see things
happening now

809
01:08:14,462 --> 01:08:15,962
all over the world.

810
01:08:17,379 --> 01:08:19,796
Why did you come
to Winterfell?

811
01:08:21,087 --> 01:08:22,462
Um...

812
01:08:24,671 --> 01:08:26,837
Jon's the one to lead
the fight against the dead.

813
01:08:26,838 --> 01:08:28,919
I know he is.

814
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:30,878
But he can't
do it alone,

815
01:08:30,879 --> 01:08:33,753
so I've come here
to help him.

816
01:08:33,754 --> 01:08:36,628
He's on his way
back to Winterfell

817
01:08:36,629 --> 01:08:38,254
with Daenerys Targaryen.

818
01:08:39,421 --> 01:08:42,461
You...
you saw this in...

819
01:08:42,462 --> 01:08:44,129
in a vision?

820
01:08:47,129 --> 01:08:48,337
Oh.

821
01:08:51,129 --> 01:08:53,337
He needs to know
the truth.

822
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:55,878
The truth
about what?

823
01:08:55,879 --> 01:08:57,670
About himself.

824
01:08:57,671 --> 01:09:01,211
No one knows.
No one but me.

825
01:09:01,212 --> 01:09:04,169
Jon isn't really
my father's son.

826
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:08,336
He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen
and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.

827
01:09:08,337 --> 01:09:12,169
He was born
in a tower in Dorne.

828
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:14,628
His last name
isn't really Snow,

829
01:09:14,629 --> 01:09:15,629
it's Sand.

830
01:09:18,004 --> 01:09:19,004
It's not.

831
01:09:20,588 --> 01:09:23,003
Dornish bastards
are named Sand.

832
01:09:23,004 --> 01:09:26,628
At the Citadel, I transcribed
a High Septon's diary.

833
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:29,379
He annulled Rhaegar's
marriage to Elia.

834
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:34,087
He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna
in a secret ceremony.

835
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:36,837
Are you certain?

836
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:39,545
It's what the High Septon
wrote in his private diary.

837
01:09:39,546 --> 01:09:41,379
I don't know
why he'd lie.

838
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:45,754
Is this something
you can see?

839
01:09:47,212 --> 01:09:51,044
Father, Smith, Warrior,

840
01:09:51,045 --> 01:09:55,919
Mother, Maiden,
Crone, Stranger.

841
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:59,712
- I am hers and she is mine...
- I am his and he is mine...

842
01:09:59,713 --> 01:10:04,044
from this day
until the end of my days.

843
01:10:04,045 --> 01:10:07,170
Robert's
Rebellion was built on a lie.

844
01:10:09,296 --> 01:10:12,421
Rhaegar didn't
kidnap my aunt or rape her.

845
01:10:22,004 --> 01:10:23,546
He loved her.

846
01:10:31,296 --> 01:10:32,920
And she loved him.

847
01:10:59,337 --> 01:11:02,296
And Jon...

848
01:11:04,337 --> 01:11:06,129
Jon's real name...

849
01:11:08,129 --> 01:11:12,461
His name
is Aegon Targaryen.

850
01:11:12,462 --> 01:11:14,671
You have
to protect him.

851
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:18,087
Promise me, Ned.

852
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:43,170
He's never been a bastard.

853
01:11:47,087 --> 01:11:49,796
He's the
heir to the Iron Throne.

854
01:12:04,629 --> 01:12:06,337
He needs to know.

855
01:12:09,546 --> 01:12:11,337
We need to tell him.

856
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:24,378
Are you
all right?

857
01:12:24,379 --> 01:12:26,295
It's just strange.

858
01:12:26,296 --> 01:12:30,254
In his own horrible way,
I believe he loved me.

859
01:12:34,212 --> 01:12:35,753
You did
the right thing.

860
01:12:35,754 --> 01:12:38,295
You did it.

861
01:12:38,296 --> 01:12:40,128
I'm just
the executioner.

862
01:12:40,129 --> 01:12:41,879
You passed
the sentence.

863
01:12:44,045 --> 01:12:46,878
You're the Lady
of Winterfell.

864
01:12:46,879 --> 01:12:48,254
Does that bother you?

865
01:12:50,838 --> 01:12:53,713
I was never going to be
as good a lady as you.

866
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,671
So I had to be
something else.

867
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:01,628
I never could have survived
what you survived.

868
01:13:01,629 --> 01:13:03,961
You would have.

869
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:05,962
You're the strongest
person I know.

870
01:13:10,045 --> 01:13:12,588
I believe that's the nicest
thing you've ever said to me.

871
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:17,961
Well, don't get
used to it.

872
01:13:17,962 --> 01:13:20,212
You're still very
strange and annoying.

873
01:13:26,713 --> 01:13:28,713
"In winter, we must
protect ourselves.

874
01:13:30,254 --> 01:13:32,296
Look after
one another."

875
01:13:34,421 --> 01:13:36,129
Father.

876
01:13:39,254 --> 01:13:43,420
"When the snows fall
and the white winds blow,

877
01:13:43,421 --> 01:13:45,378
the lone wolf dies,

878
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:47,838
but the pack survives."

879
01:13:54,838 --> 01:13:56,129
I miss him.

880
01:13:59,462 --> 01:14:00,962
Me, too.

881
01:15:22,588 --> 01:15:24,712
It's a long way down.

882
01:15:24,713 --> 01:15:28,546
Yeah. The crows keep telling
me I'll get used to it.

883
01:15:37,296 --> 01:15:40,336
I can see movement...

884
01:15:40,337 --> 01:15:43,045
Watch, on the tree line!

885
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:45,878
What is it?

886
01:17:17,045 --> 01:17:18,170
Come on!

887
01:17:19,379 --> 01:17:22,004
Run! Run!
