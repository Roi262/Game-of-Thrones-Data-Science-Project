1
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:06,707
The Lannisters have
declared war on house Tyrell.

2
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:07,958
They have declared war on Dorne.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,458
We must be allies now,
if we wish to survive.

4
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:14,542
I offer vengeance... justice...

5
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:16,375
Fire and blood.

6
00:00:18,258 --> 00:00:19,299
I traveled south

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,049
under orders from the Lord Commander.

8
00:00:21,383 --> 00:00:23,383
You ought to be a Maester.

9
00:00:23,592 --> 00:00:25,798
Spending your life reading
about the achievements

10
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:26,924
of better men.

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,798
It's a map of Dragonstone.

12
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:29,924
That's dragonglass.

13
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:31,550
A mountain of it, beneath the ground.

14
00:00:31,758 --> 00:00:32,924
John needs to know.

15
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:34,750
You must send me away.

16
00:00:34,924 --> 00:00:36,840
I command you to heal yourself.

17
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:39,133
I command you to find the cure.

18
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:49,133
So why's a nice girl on her
own heading to King's Landing?

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,966
I'm going to kill the queen.

20
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:54,257
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

21
00:00:54,258 --> 00:00:55,924
the new king of the Iron Islands.

22
00:00:58,383 --> 00:01:01,799
The Iron Fleet is the greatest
armada Westeros has ever seen.

23
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,007
The surest way to a woman's
heart is with a gift.

24
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:08,091
I won't return to King's Landing
until I have that for you.

25
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:12,166
Shall we begin?

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -

27
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:42,757
On a night like this,
you came into the world.

28
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:44,048
I remember that storm.

29
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:46,798
All the dogs in King's Landing

30
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,798
howled through the night.

31
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,424
I wish I could remember it.

32
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:53,340
I always thought this
would be a homecoming.

33
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:55,132
Doesn't feel like home.

34
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:57,466
We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.

35
00:03:57,467 --> 00:03:58,758
Good.

36
00:04:00,175 --> 00:04:02,007
Not so many lions.

37
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,923
Cersei controls fewer than
half the Seven Kingdoms.

38
00:04:04,924 --> 00:04:07,215
The lords of Westeros despise her.

39
00:04:07,216 --> 00:04:10,090
Even before your arrival,
they plotted against her.

40
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:13,591
- Now...
- They cry out for their true queen?

41
00:04:13,592 --> 00:04:16,215
They drink secret toasts to my health?

42
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:18,174
People used to tell my
brother that sort of thing,

43
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,216
and he was stupid
enough to believe them.

44
00:04:25,008 --> 00:04:29,048
If Viserys had three dragons
and an army at his back,

45
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:31,048
he'd have invaded
King's Landing already.

46
00:04:31,049 --> 00:04:33,632
Conquering Westeros
would be easy for you.

47
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:36,049
But you're not here to
be queen of the ashes.

48
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:38,798
No.

49
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:41,048
We can take the Seven Kingdoms

50
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:43,923
without turning it
into a slaughterhouse.

51
00:04:43,924 --> 00:04:46,507
If the great houses support
your claim against Cersei,

52
00:04:46,508 --> 00:04:48,591
the game is won.

53
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:51,048
With the Tyrell army and
the Dornish on our side,

54
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:54,215
we have powerful allies in the south.

55
00:04:54,216 --> 00:04:56,798
I never properly thanked you for that.

56
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:59,549
They joined our side, my queen,

57
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,090
because they believe in you.

58
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:04,425
You served my father,
didn't you, Lord Varys?

59
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:07,048
I did.

60
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:08,382
And then you served the
man who overthrew him.

61
00:05:08,383 --> 00:05:10,132
I had a choice, Your Grace...

62
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:12,257
serve Robert Baratheon
or face the headman's axe.

63
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:14,591
But you didn't serve him long.

64
00:05:14,592 --> 00:05:16,049
You turned against him.

65
00:05:17,508 --> 00:05:21,215
Robert was an improvement
on your father, to be sure.

66
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:23,299
There have been few rulers in history

67
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,382
as cruel as the Mad King.

68
00:05:25,383 --> 00:05:27,840
Robert was neither mad nor cruel.

69
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:30,382
He simply had no interest in being king.

70
00:05:30,383 --> 00:05:33,090
So you took it upon yourself
to find a better one.

71
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:35,299
Your Grace,

72
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,299
when I was ready to drink
myself into a small coffin,

73
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,340
Lord Varys told me about
a queen in the east who...

74
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:43,258
Before I came to power,
you favored my brother.

75
00:05:44,675 --> 00:05:47,965
All your spies, your little birds,

76
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:51,633
did they tell you Viserys
was cruel, stupid, and weak?

77
00:05:53,758 --> 00:05:56,063
Would those qualities
have made for a good king

78
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,257
in your learned opinion?

79
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,923
Until your marriage to
Khal Drogo, Your Grace,

80
00:06:00,924 --> 00:06:03,424
I knew nothing about
you, save your existence

81
00:06:03,425 --> 00:06:05,757
and that you were said to be beautiful.

82
00:06:05,758 --> 00:06:09,466
So you and your friends traded me
like a prized horse to the Dothraki.

83
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:11,466
Which you turned to your advantage.

84
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:13,508
Who gave the order to kill me?

85
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:19,549
King Robert.

86
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,299
Who hired the assassins?

87
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,466
Who sent word to Essos to
murder Daenerys Targaryen?

88
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:30,007
- Your Grace, I did what had to be done to...
- To keep yourself alive.

89
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:32,299
Lord Varys has proven
himself a loyal servant.

90
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,090
Proven himself loyal?
Quite the opposite.

91
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:37,798
If he dislikes one monarch, he
conspires to crown the next one.

92
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:40,215
What kind of a servant is that?

93
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:42,340
The kind the realm needs.

94
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:45,716
Incompetence should not be
rewarded with blind loyalty.

95
00:06:45,717 --> 00:06:48,675
As long as I have my
eyes, I'll use them.

96
00:06:50,383 --> 00:06:52,382
I wasn't born into a great house.

97
00:06:52,383 --> 00:06:54,965
I came from nothing.

98
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:57,923
I was sold as a slave and
carved up as an offering.

99
00:06:57,924 --> 00:07:01,757
When I was a child, I lived in
alleys, gutters, abandoned houses.

100
00:07:01,758 --> 00:07:04,340
You wish to know where
my true loyalties lie?

101
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,549
Not with any king or
queen, but with the people.

102
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,507
The people who suffer under
despots and prosper under just rule.

103
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:13,883
The people whose hearts you aim to win.

104
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:19,591
If you demand blind allegiance,

105
00:07:19,592 --> 00:07:22,340
I respect your wishes.

106
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:26,340
Grey Worm can behead me or
your dragons can devour me.

107
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:28,923
But if you let me live,
I will serve you well.

108
00:07:28,924 --> 00:07:32,215
I will dedicate myself to
seeing you on the Iron Throne

109
00:07:32,216 --> 00:07:34,716
because I choose you.

110
00:07:34,717 --> 00:07:38,258
Because I know the people
have no better chance than you.

111
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,717
Swear this to me, Varys.

112
00:07:50,216 --> 00:07:53,674
If you ever think I'm
failing the people,

113
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:56,882
you won't conspire behind my back.

114
00:07:56,883 --> 00:07:58,840
You'll look me in the eye
as you have done today,

115
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:00,675
and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.

116
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,675
I swear it, my queen.

117
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:15,923
And I swear this...
if you ever betray me,

118
00:08:15,924 --> 00:08:17,633
I'll burn you alive.

119
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:24,383
I would expect nothing less
from the Mother of Dragons.

120
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:29,424
Forgive me, my queen.

121
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,592
A red priestess from
As'shai has come to see you.

122
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,790
_

123
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,728
_

124
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:52,558
_

125
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:54,562
_

126
00:08:54,682 --> 00:08:57,786
_

127
00:08:57,906 --> 00:09:00,858
_

128
00:09:01,844 --> 00:09:03,488
_

129
00:09:04,788 --> 00:09:06,307
_

130
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:08,411
_

131
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:12,674
She once served another
who wanted the Iron Throne.

132
00:09:12,675 --> 00:09:16,591
It didn't end well for
Stannis Baratheon, did it?

133
00:09:16,592 --> 00:09:18,257
No, it didn't.

134
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:22,090
You chose an auspicious day
to arrive at Dragonstone.

135
00:09:22,091 --> 00:09:23,965
We've just decided to pardon those

136
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:26,633
who once served the wrong king.

137
00:09:30,592 --> 00:09:33,965
The Lord of Light doesn't have
many followers in Westeros, does he?

138
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:37,632
Not yet, but even those
who don't worship the Lord

139
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:39,132
can serve his cause.

140
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:41,049
What does your lord expect from me?

141
00:09:46,841 --> 00:09:49,383
"The prince who was promised
will bring the dawn."

142
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,674
I'm afraid I'm not a prince.

143
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,257
Your Grace, forgive me,

144
00:09:54,258 --> 00:09:57,215
but your translation
is not quite accurate.

145
00:09:57,216 --> 00:09:59,965
That noun has no
gender in High Valyrian,

146
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,923
so the proper translation
for that prophecy would be,

147
00:10:02,924 --> 00:10:07,299
"The prince or princess who was
promised will bring the dawn."

148
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,466
Doesn't really roll
off the tongue, does it?

149
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:11,008
No, but I like it better.

150
00:10:12,592 --> 00:10:14,549
And you believe this
prophecy refers to me?

151
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,340
Prophecies are dangerous things.

152
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:20,674
I believe you have a role to play.

153
00:10:20,675 --> 00:10:22,549
As does another...

154
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,049
the King in the North, Jon Snow.

155
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:27,757
Jon Snow?

156
00:10:27,758 --> 00:10:30,549
- Ned Stark's bastard?
- You know him?

157
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,716
I travelled with him to the Wall
when he joined the Night's Watch.

158
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:37,840
And why do you think the Lord of
Light singled out this Jon Snow?

159
00:10:37,841 --> 00:10:40,549
Aside from the visions you've
seen in the flames, that is.

160
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,466
As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch,

161
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:45,716
he allowed the wildlings
south of the Wall

162
00:10:45,717 --> 00:10:47,798
to protect them from grave danger.

163
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,382
As King in the North,

164
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:52,215
he has united those wildlings
with the Northern houses,

165
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:54,716
so together they may
face their common enemy.

166
00:10:54,717 --> 00:10:56,840
He sounds like quite a man.

167
00:10:56,841 --> 00:10:59,215
Summon Jon Snow.

168
00:10:59,216 --> 00:11:00,882
Let him stand before you

169
00:11:00,883 --> 00:11:02,507
and tell you the things
that have happened to him,

170
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:06,133
the things that he has
seen with his own eyes.

171
00:11:07,675 --> 00:11:09,299
I can't speak to prophecies

172
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,923
or visions in the flames,

173
00:11:11,924 --> 00:11:14,716
but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him.

174
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:17,215
And I am an excellent
judge of character.

175
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:19,674
If he does rule the North,

176
00:11:19,675 --> 00:11:21,425
he would make a valuable ally.

177
00:11:22,758 --> 00:11:24,674
The Lannisters executed his father

178
00:11:24,675 --> 00:11:26,840
and conspired to murder his brother.

179
00:11:26,841 --> 00:11:30,049
Jon Snow has even more reason
to hate Cersei than you do.

180
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:36,215
Very well.

181
00:11:36,216 --> 00:11:38,007
Send a raven north.

182
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:40,007
Tell Jon Snow that his queen

183
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:43,007
invites him to come to Dragonstone...

184
00:11:43,008 --> 00:11:44,758
and bend the knee.

185
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,299
Gather round. Come here.

186
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,798
You think it's really Tyrion?

187
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:03,299
It could be someone trying
to lure you into a trap.

188
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,840
Read the last bit.

189
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:09,466
"All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes."

190
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:11,215
What does that mean?

191
00:12:11,216 --> 00:12:14,133
It's something he said to
me the first night we met.

192
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:17,300
You know him better than any of us.

193
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:19,467
What do you think?

194
00:12:22,924 --> 00:12:25,549
Tyrion's not like the other Lannisters.

195
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:29,340
He was always kind to me,
but it's too great a risk.

196
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:31,340
"The Seven Kingdoms will bleed

197
00:12:31,341 --> 00:12:33,840
as long as Cersei sits
on the Iron Throne.

198
00:12:33,841 --> 00:12:35,007
Join us.

199
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:36,841
Together, we can end her tyranny."

200
00:12:41,008 --> 00:12:43,007
Sounds like a charmer.

201
00:12:43,008 --> 00:12:45,215
Of course, the casual
mention of a Dothraki horde,

202
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:48,174
a legion of Unsullied,
and three dragons...

203
00:12:48,175 --> 00:12:49,717
a bit less charming.

204
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:52,882
What?

205
00:12:52,883 --> 00:12:56,132
Fire kills wights, you told me.

206
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:57,300
What breathes fire?

207
00:12:59,383 --> 00:13:01,507
You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?

208
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:03,923
- No, too dangerous.
- But?

209
00:13:03,924 --> 00:13:06,882
But if the Army of the
Dead makes it past the Wall,

210
00:13:06,883 --> 00:13:09,383
do we have enough men to fight them?

211
00:13:13,717 --> 00:13:16,090
If the Mad King's daughter
takes the Iron Throne,

212
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:18,008
she'll destroy the realm as we know it.

213
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:22,257
Some of you are
bannermen of House Tyrell.

214
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:25,382
But House Tyrell is in open
rebellion against the crown.

215
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:28,591
With their help, the Mad King's daughter

216
00:13:28,592 --> 00:13:32,090
has ferried an army of
savages to our shores...

217
00:13:32,091 --> 00:13:33,919
mindless Unsullied soldiers

218
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,882
who will destroy your
castles and your holdfasts,

219
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:40,048
Dothraki heathens who will burn
your villages to the ground,

220
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:42,257
rape and enslave your women,

221
00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:45,174
and butcher your children
without a second thought.

222
00:13:45,175 --> 00:13:50,048
This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards
centuries of service and loyalty.

223
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:52,882
You all remember the Mad King.

224
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:56,424
You remember the horrors he
inflicted upon his people.

225
00:13:56,425 --> 00:13:58,424
His daughter is no different.

226
00:13:58,425 --> 00:14:01,215
In Essos, her brutality
is already legendary.

227
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:05,507
She crucified hundreds of
noblemen in Slaver's Bay.

228
00:14:05,508 --> 00:14:08,174
And when she grew bored of that,

229
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:10,424
she fed them to her dragons.

230
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:14,007
It is my solemn duty to
protect the people, and I will.

231
00:14:14,008 --> 00:14:17,174
But I need your help, my lords.

232
00:14:17,175 --> 00:14:19,966
We must stand together, all of us...

233
00:14:21,175 --> 00:14:23,174
if we hope to stop her.

234
00:14:28,508 --> 00:14:31,592
She has three full-grown
dragons, Your Grace.

235
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:34,757
The same as Aegon when he conquered

236
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:37,257
the Seven Kingdoms.

237
00:14:37,258 --> 00:14:39,633
How do you propose to stop them?

238
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,425
We are currently at work
on a solution, my lord.

239
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,300
Lord Tarly.

240
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:59,048
Ser Jaime.

241
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:00,757
I believe you know my son.

242
00:15:00,758 --> 00:15:01,758
Ser Jaime.

243
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:03,257
Rickard, isn't it?

244
00:15:03,258 --> 00:15:04,965
Dickon.

245
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:06,507
That's it.

246
00:15:06,508 --> 00:15:08,507
Thank you for coming.

247
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,333
The other lords of the Reach
look to you for guidance,

248
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:12,424
now more than ever.

249
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:14,132
They might not have come if you hadn't.

250
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:17,424
If my queen summons
me, I answer the call.

251
00:15:17,425 --> 00:15:20,216
And I've heard what she
does to those who defy her.

252
00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:25,466
You ride for Horn Hill today?

253
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,174
I have an army to mobilize.

254
00:15:28,175 --> 00:15:30,507
Won't be long before
the fighting starts.

255
00:15:30,508 --> 00:15:32,966
And which side will you be fighting for?

256
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,299
You were the only man to defeat
Robert Baratheon in battle.

257
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,215
Not even Rhaegar
Targaryen could do that.

258
00:15:39,216 --> 00:15:42,174
It's a long ride back to the
Reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?

259
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:45,132
I want you to be my ranking
general in the wars to come.

260
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:47,257
I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei

261
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:50,257
and I want you to help
me destroy her enemies.

262
00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:52,090
All her enemies.

263
00:15:52,091 --> 00:15:54,133
Including Olenna Tyrell.

264
00:15:56,883 --> 00:15:59,382
I'm a Tarly.

265
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:00,883
That name means something.

266
00:16:02,383 --> 00:16:04,923
We're not oathbreakers.
We're not schemers.

267
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:07,382
We don't stab our rivals in the back

268
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,216
or cut their throats at weddings.

269
00:16:12,341 --> 00:16:15,257
I swore an oath to House Tyrell.

270
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:18,592
You swore an oath to the
crown as well, Lord Tarly.

271
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:22,382
I've known Olenna since I was a child.

272
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:25,007
She was a great woman once.

273
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:27,382
Now she's broken.

274
00:16:27,383 --> 00:16:29,507
She wants revenge so badly,

275
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:31,757
she brought the Dothraki to our shores.

276
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:35,675
The Dothraki in Westeros for
the first time in history.

277
00:16:38,341 --> 00:16:40,591
I know you don't like my sister,

278
00:16:40,592 --> 00:16:43,757
but you have to make a choice.

279
00:16:43,758 --> 00:16:45,798
Do you fight with us

280
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,924
or with foreign savages and eunuchs?

281
00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:55,424
When the war is won,

282
00:16:55,425 --> 00:16:58,591
the queen will need a
new Warden of the South.

283
00:16:58,592 --> 00:17:01,424
I can think of no better man

284
00:17:01,425 --> 00:17:03,258
than Randyll Tarly.

285
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,090
The infection has spread too far.

286
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:11,049
You should have cut off your
arm the moment you were touched.

287
00:17:13,758 --> 00:17:14,883
How long?

288
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:19,757
It'll be years before it kills you.

289
00:17:19,758 --> 00:17:21,340
Could be 10.

290
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,007
Could be 20.

291
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,758
But how long until...?

292
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:28,257
Your mind?

293
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:31,133
Six months, maybe fewer.

294
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:44,924
Um...

295
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:49,632
Pardon, Archmaester.

296
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:52,632
I met Stannis Baratheon's
daughter at Castle Black.

297
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:55,090
She had the greyscale
as a baby and was cured.

298
00:17:55,091 --> 00:17:56,674
- No.
- Isn't there some way...

299
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,466
Does this look like a baby to you?

300
00:17:58,467 --> 00:17:59,798
- No.
- Have you studied

301
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:01,840
the varying rates of
greyscale progression

302
00:18:01,841 --> 00:18:03,467
in infants and fully grown men?

303
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:06,883
No.

304
00:18:08,675 --> 00:18:10,257
Maester Cressen discovered

305
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:12,841
Shireen Baratheon's
affliction immediately.

306
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,008
This is quite advanced.

307
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:20,049
And beyond our skills, ser.

308
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:26,466
Were you a commoner, I'd have
you shipped to Valyria at once

309
00:18:26,467 --> 00:18:29,007
to live out your life
with the stone men.

310
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:32,841
As an anointed knight,
I'll allow you one more day.

311
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:38,175
How you choose to spend
that time is up to you.

312
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:45,675
Come, Samwell.

313
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:52,425
Should we send word
to your family, Ser...?

314
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,049
Jorah.

315
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:59,382
Jorah Mormont.

316
00:18:59,383 --> 00:19:01,424
Mormont?

317
00:19:01,425 --> 00:19:03,174
There's no need.

318
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,758
I've been dead to them for years.

319
00:19:07,425 --> 00:19:09,091
Come, Samwell!

320
00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:24,965
Have you ever been
down here, Your Grace?

321
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:26,467
No, I can't say I have.

322
00:19:28,717 --> 00:19:30,607
I haven't seen these since Robert

323
00:19:30,608 --> 00:19:32,174
had them removed from the throne room.

324
00:19:32,175 --> 00:19:36,132
Curious that King Robert
did not have them destroyed.

325
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,299
They were his trophies.

326
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,507
He couldn't keep them around.

327
00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:41,424
They would have made him look small.

328
00:19:41,425 --> 00:19:44,966
Sometimes he would come
down here and look at them.

329
00:19:47,425 --> 00:19:50,133
I believe he brought
his whores on occasion.

330
00:19:57,467 --> 00:19:59,258
Balerion the Dread.

331
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:03,674
The beast that Aegon
rode across the sea.

332
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:06,591
His flames forged the Iron Throne

333
00:20:06,592 --> 00:20:09,467
and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.

334
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:11,799
Powerful...

335
00:20:12,924 --> 00:20:14,341
but not invincible.

336
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,132
Apparently, one of Daenerys's dragons

337
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:25,799
was wounded by spears in
the fighting pits of Meereen.

338
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,632
And if they can be wounded,

339
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:31,008
they can be killed.

340
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,299
The finest artillators and
blacksmiths in King's Landing

341
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,133
have been laboring day
and night, Your Grace.

342
00:20:45,675 --> 00:20:48,175
If you'll kindly pull that lever.

343
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:07,175
If you want the Iron Throne, take it.

344
00:21:09,258 --> 00:21:12,340
We have an army, a
fleet, and three dragons.

345
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:16,007
We should hit King's Landing now,
hard, with everything we have.

346
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,507
The city will fall within a day.

347
00:21:18,508 --> 00:21:20,147
If we turn the dragons loose,

348
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:21,424
tens of thousands will
die in the firestorms.

349
00:21:21,425 --> 00:21:23,007
It's called war.

350
00:21:23,008 --> 00:21:26,007
You don't have the stomach for
it, scurry back into hiding.

351
00:21:26,008 --> 00:21:27,340
I know how you wage war.

352
00:21:27,341 --> 00:21:30,090
We don't poison little girls here.

353
00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:31,382
Myrcella was innocent.

354
00:21:31,383 --> 00:21:32,757
She was a Lannister.

355
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,382
There are no innocent Lannisters.

356
00:21:35,383 --> 00:21:38,674
My greatest regret is that
Oberyn died fighting for you.

357
00:21:38,675 --> 00:21:40,549
That's enough.

358
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,132
Lord Tyrion is Hand of the Queen.

359
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:43,550
You will treat him with respect.

360
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:50,550
I am not here to be queen of the ashes.

361
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:53,965
That's very nice to hear.

362
00:21:53,966 --> 00:21:55,923
Of course, I can't remember a queen

363
00:21:55,924 --> 00:21:58,882
who was better loved
than my granddaughter.

364
00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:00,840
The common people loved her.

365
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:02,591
The nobles loved her.

366
00:22:02,592 --> 00:22:04,340
And what is left of her now?

367
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:07,174
Ashes.

368
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:08,882
Commoners, nobles,

369
00:22:08,883 --> 00:22:10,757
they're all just children, really.

370
00:22:10,758 --> 00:22:14,383
They won't obey you
unless they fear you.

371
00:22:16,383 --> 00:22:18,632
I'm grateful to you, Lady
Olenna, for your counsel.

372
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:20,549
I'm grateful to all of you.

373
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,174
But you have chosen to follow me.

374
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,549
I will not attack King's Landing.

375
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,382
We will not attack King's Landing.

376
00:22:28,383 --> 00:22:32,048
Then how do you mean
to take the Iron Throne?

377
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:33,383
By asking nicely?

378
00:22:35,508 --> 00:22:36,923
We will lay siege to the capital,

379
00:22:36,924 --> 00:22:38,632
surrounding the city on all sides.

380
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:40,424
Cersei will have the Iron Throne,

381
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,798
but no food for her army or the people.

382
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,716
But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.

383
00:22:45,717 --> 00:22:47,757
Cersei will try to rally
the lords of Westeros

384
00:22:47,758 --> 00:22:49,424
by appealing to their loyalty,

385
00:22:49,425 --> 00:22:51,090
their love for their country.

386
00:22:51,091 --> 00:22:53,007
If we besiege the city with foreigners,

387
00:22:53,008 --> 00:22:54,716
we prove her point.

388
00:22:54,717 --> 00:22:56,340
Our army should be Westerosi.

389
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,632
And I suppose we're
providing the Westerosi?

390
00:22:58,633 --> 00:22:59,923
You are.

391
00:22:59,924 --> 00:23:03,300
Lady Greyjoy will escort
you home to Sunspear.

392
00:23:06,216 --> 00:23:09,299
And her Iron Fleet will
ferry the Dornish army

393
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,299
back up to King's Landing.

394
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,132
The Dornish will lay
siege to the capital

395
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:16,174
alongside the Tyrell army.

396
00:23:16,175 --> 00:23:18,840
Two great kingdoms
united against Cersei.

397
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:23,965
So, your master plan
is to use our armies.

398
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:27,341
Forgive me for asking, but why
did you bother to bring your own?

399
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,840
The Unsullied will
have another objective.

400
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:35,424
For decades, House Lannister has
been the true power in Westeros.

401
00:23:35,425 --> 00:23:39,591
And the seat of that
power is Casterly Rock.

402
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:41,507
Grey Worm and the Unsullied

403
00:23:41,508 --> 00:23:44,383
will sail for the Rock and take it.

404
00:24:02,924 --> 00:24:04,550
Do I have your support?

405
00:24:06,341 --> 00:24:07,717
You have mine.

406
00:24:09,508 --> 00:24:11,383
Dorne is with you, Your Grace.

407
00:24:15,592 --> 00:24:17,049
Thank you all.

408
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:20,383
Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?

409
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:33,757
I realize you're here out of hatred
for Cersei and not love for me.

410
00:24:33,758 --> 00:24:37,674
But I swear to you, she
will pay for what she's done.

411
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:40,340
And we will bring
peace back to Westeros.

412
00:24:40,341 --> 00:24:42,382
Peace?

413
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:45,048
Do you think that's what
we had under your father?

414
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:48,174
Or his father? Or his?

415
00:24:48,175 --> 00:24:50,840
Peace never lasts, my dear.

416
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:53,175
Will you take a bit of
advice from an old woman?

417
00:24:55,216 --> 00:24:57,174
He's a clever man, your Hand.

418
00:24:57,175 --> 00:25:01,007
I've known a great many clever men.

419
00:25:01,008 --> 00:25:02,923
I've outlived them all.

420
00:25:02,924 --> 00:25:04,840
You know why?

421
00:25:04,841 --> 00:25:06,382
I ignored them.

422
00:25:06,383 --> 00:25:09,882
The lords of Westeros are sheep.

423
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,258
Are you a sheep?

424
00:25:12,966 --> 00:25:14,591
No.

425
00:25:14,592 --> 00:25:16,882
You're a dragon.

426
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:18,425
Be a dragon.

427
00:25:22,008 --> 00:25:24,757
Mají.

428
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:30,883
You leave tomorrow.

429
00:25:33,717 --> 00:25:36,132
Were you going to say goodbye?

430
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:38,757
I will see you when I return.

431
00:25:38,758 --> 00:25:40,633
But you don't know when that will be.

432
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:43,708
No one knows.

433
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:48,467
I wish you good fortune.

434
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,008
Missandei.

435
00:26:00,508 --> 00:26:02,965
It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.

436
00:26:02,966 --> 00:26:04,174
Why?

437
00:26:04,175 --> 00:26:05,840
You know why.

438
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:06,924
I don't.

439
00:26:10,175 --> 00:26:13,592
Y... you are my weakness.

440
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:17,048
That's what I am?

441
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:18,507
Your weakness?

442
00:26:18,508 --> 00:26:22,216
When Unsullied are young,
the masters learn their fears.

443
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:26,174
One boy is scared of dogs,

444
00:26:26,175 --> 00:26:28,048
one boy hates high places,

445
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:30,882
one is frightened of the ocean.

446
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:33,340
They make the boy sleep with dogs

447
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,257
or climb a cliff.

448
00:26:35,258 --> 00:26:37,549
They throw him in the water.

449
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,840
If he learns to swim, good.

450
00:26:39,841 --> 00:26:41,799
If he drowns, good.

451
00:26:43,008 --> 00:26:46,007
Either way, strong Unsullied.

452
00:26:46,008 --> 00:26:48,424
But I had no fears.

453
00:26:48,425 --> 00:26:52,216
I was never the biggest,
never the strongest...

454
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:56,883
but I was bravest, always.

455
00:26:58,341 --> 00:27:00,299
- I believe it.
- Until...

456
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:04,091
I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naath.

457
00:27:05,633 --> 00:27:08,883
Now I have fear.

458
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:15,717
I do, too.

459
00:28:31,508 --> 00:28:32,924
No.

460
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:36,133
I want to see you.

461
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:38,841
Please.

462
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:12,840
Might be useful.

463
00:30:12,841 --> 00:30:14,716
Ch'Vyalthan was a dreadful writer,

464
00:30:14,717 --> 00:30:16,549
but an excellent researcher.

465
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:19,007
- Archmaester, I wondered if I...
- And this one.

466
00:30:19,008 --> 00:30:20,882
Maester Faull was quite the opposite...

467
00:30:20,883 --> 00:30:23,632
a brilliant stylist who invented
half the stories he tells.

468
00:30:23,633 --> 00:30:25,257
Um, I wanted to ask you...

469
00:30:25,258 --> 00:30:27,048
If you're going to
write histories, Tarly,

470
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:28,632
you have to do the research.

471
00:30:28,633 --> 00:30:30,507
If you want people to
read your histories,

472
00:30:30,508 --> 00:30:32,757
you need a bit of style.

473
00:30:32,758 --> 00:30:34,757
I'm not writing "A Chronicle of the Wars

474
00:30:34,758 --> 00:30:36,591
Following the Death of King Robert I"

475
00:30:36,592 --> 00:30:38,883
so it can sit on a shelf unread.

476
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:43,717
What? You don't like the title?

477
00:30:44,924 --> 00:30:46,257
What would you call it, then?

478
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:49,591
Mm, possibly something
a bit more poetic?

479
00:30:49,592 --> 00:30:52,340
We're not poets, Tarly.

480
00:30:52,341 --> 00:30:54,507
Um, Archmaester, if I
could just have a moment.

481
00:30:54,508 --> 00:30:56,257
This is your moment.

482
00:30:56,258 --> 00:30:57,717
Use it wisely.

483
00:30:59,633 --> 00:31:01,717
I may have found a
way to treat Ser Jorah.

484
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:05,090
There are two recorded cases

485
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:06,923
of advanced greyscale being cured.

486
00:31:06,924 --> 00:31:09,082
I found the procedure in
the study of rare diseases

487
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:10,090
by Archmaester Pylos.

488
00:31:10,091 --> 00:31:12,257
I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos

489
00:31:12,258 --> 00:31:14,215
and his study of rare diseases.

490
00:31:14,216 --> 00:31:16,215
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.

491
00:31:16,216 --> 00:31:18,133
And shall I tell you how he died?

492
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,633
From greyscale.

493
00:31:22,425 --> 00:31:24,299
- Oh.
- The procedure's far too dangerous,

494
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,467
which is why it's now forbidden.

495
00:32:09,883 --> 00:32:11,299
Hello.

496
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,841
What are you doing?

497
00:32:15,216 --> 00:32:17,382
You're Jorah Mormont,

498
00:32:17,383 --> 00:32:19,341
the only son of Jeor Mormont.

499
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:22,466
My name is Samwell Tarly,

500
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:24,257
Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch,

501
00:32:24,258 --> 00:32:27,048
training to serve as
maester at Castle Black.

502
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:28,340
I knew your father.

503
00:32:28,341 --> 00:32:29,841
I was with him when he died.

504
00:32:35,924 --> 00:32:38,049
You are not dying today, Ser Jorah.

505
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:45,674
Drink this.

506
00:32:45,675 --> 00:32:47,466
- What is it?
- Rum.

507
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,383
Drink it all, please. I'm
afraid this is going to hurt.

508
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:12,717
If you could take off your shirt.

509
00:33:26,508 --> 00:33:29,592
If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard.

510
00:33:31,091 --> 00:33:33,048
I'm sorry, but no one knows I'm here,

511
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:35,091
and if they hear you screaming,
then we're both finished.

512
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:40,758
Have you ever done this before?

513
00:33:48,216 --> 00:33:49,291
No.

514
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:53,467
But no one else will try it,
so I'm the best you've got.

515
00:33:56,966 --> 00:33:58,425
Have a seat.

516
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:05,340
I'm going to have to remove the
entire upper layer of infected tissue,

517
00:34:05,341 --> 00:34:07,633
then apply a medicinal
ointment to the...

518
00:34:19,966 --> 00:34:23,466
Shh, shh!

519
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:25,716
Shh.

520
00:34:25,717 --> 00:34:28,132
Again, I'm sorry,

521
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:30,633
but please try not to scream.

522
00:35:29,341 --> 00:35:31,965
They say her dragons
are bigger than Aegon's.

523
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:34,716
Horseshit. Cersei's just
trying to frighten us.

524
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:36,299
I hope it's true.

525
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,340
If she lays siege to King's
Landing, prices will triple.

526
00:35:39,341 --> 00:35:42,716
As long as we get back
there before they start.

527
00:35:42,717 --> 00:35:45,258
One more round. It's a long ride.

528
00:35:46,383 --> 00:35:48,716
Arry!

529
00:35:48,717 --> 00:35:49,924
Hello, Hot Pie.

530
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:52,258
Sit down.

531
00:35:54,675 --> 00:35:55,924
Who's that for?

532
00:36:04,717 --> 00:36:06,425
Mm. This is good.

533
00:36:08,425 --> 00:36:09,882
You think so?

534
00:36:09,883 --> 00:36:12,632
The secret is browning the
butter before making the dough.

535
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:15,591
Most people don't do that
'cause it takes up too much time.

536
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:17,215
Mm, I didn't do that.

537
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,757
You've been making pies?

538
00:36:18,758 --> 00:36:21,090
One or two.

539
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:23,090
I can't believe you're here.

540
00:36:23,091 --> 00:36:25,549
Did you meet the big lady?

541
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,549
- Big lady?
- The lady knight?

542
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,757
You know, I figured she was a
knight 'cause she had armor on.

543
00:36:30,758 --> 00:36:34,591
She was looking for your
sister, but I told her about you.

544
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,091
Did she ever find you?

545
00:36:37,675 --> 00:36:39,049
She found me.

546
00:36:44,341 --> 00:36:45,592
What happened to you, Arry?

547
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:57,091
You got any ale?

548
00:37:12,467 --> 00:37:14,632
- Where you heading?
- King's Landing.

549
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:17,132
- Why?
- Heard Cersei's queen now.

550
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:18,716
Heard she blew up the Great Sept.

551
00:37:18,717 --> 00:37:20,299
That must have been something to see.

552
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,090
- Boom.
- Mm.

553
00:37:22,091 --> 00:37:24,299
I can't believe someone would do that.

554
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,841
Cersei would do that.

555
00:37:28,008 --> 00:37:31,048
I thought you'd be
heading for Winterfell.

556
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:33,174
Why would I go there?
The Boltons have it.

557
00:37:33,175 --> 00:37:35,633
No, the Boltons are dead.

558
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:39,007
What?

559
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:41,174
Jon Snow came down from Castle
Black with a wildling army

560
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,965
and won the Battle of the Bastards.

561
00:37:42,966 --> 00:37:44,383
He's King of the North now.

562
00:37:46,091 --> 00:37:47,174
You're lying.

563
00:37:47,175 --> 00:37:49,048
Why would I lie about that?

564
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:50,508
He's your brother, right?

565
00:37:57,425 --> 00:37:59,840
Thanks for the pie.

566
00:37:59,841 --> 00:38:01,757
Friends don't pay.

567
00:38:01,758 --> 00:38:04,048
Can't believe I thought you were a boy.

568
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:05,966
You're pretty.

569
00:38:07,175 --> 00:38:08,175
Thanks.

570
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:15,592
Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.

571
00:38:16,717 --> 00:38:18,382
Try not to get killed.

572
00:38:18,383 --> 00:38:19,798
Ah, I won't.

573
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:21,048
I'm like you, Arry.

574
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:22,717
I'm a survivor.

575
00:38:26,966 --> 00:38:29,049
200 miles to King's Landing.

576
00:38:30,592 --> 00:38:32,717
One bottle of rum. You
think we'll make it?

577
00:39:06,799 --> 00:39:08,466
Come in.

578
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:11,924
A raven, my king, from the Citadel.

579
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:24,466
This message was sent
to me by Samwell Tarly.

580
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:27,798
He was my brother at the Night's Watch,

581
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:32,340
a man I trust as much
as anyone in this world.

582
00:39:32,341 --> 00:39:35,132
He's discovered proof that Dragonstone

583
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:37,965
sits on a mountain of dragonglass.

584
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:46,299
I received this a few days ago

585
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,924
from Dragonstone.

586
00:39:49,592 --> 00:39:51,923
It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.

587
00:39:53,966 --> 00:39:57,299
He is now Hand of the
Queen to Daenerys Targaryen.

588
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,340
She intends to take the Iron
Throne from Cersei Lannister.

589
00:40:01,341 --> 00:40:03,257
She has a powerful army at her back

590
00:40:03,258 --> 00:40:07,132
and, if this message is to be believed,

591
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:08,424
three dragons.

592
00:40:10,425 --> 00:40:13,174
Lord Tyrion has invited
me to Dragonstone

593
00:40:13,175 --> 00:40:14,924
to meet with Daenerys.

594
00:40:16,258 --> 00:40:17,674
And I'm going to accept.

595
00:40:17,675 --> 00:40:19,008
Accept?!

596
00:40:21,675 --> 00:40:25,466
We need this dragonglass, my lords!

597
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:27,424
We know that dragonglass can destroy

598
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,340
both white walkers and their army.

599
00:40:29,341 --> 00:40:32,883
We need to mine it and
turn it into weapons.

600
00:40:34,341 --> 00:40:36,257
But more importantly, we need allies!

601
00:40:36,258 --> 00:40:40,549
The Night King's army
grows larger by the day.

602
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,299
We can't defeat them on our own.

603
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,132
We don't have the numbers.

604
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:47,840
Daenerys has her own army
and she has dragonfire.

605
00:40:47,841 --> 00:40:51,132
I need to try and persuade
her to fight with us.

606
00:40:51,133 --> 00:40:54,257
Ser Davos and I will ride
for White Harbor tomorrow,

607
00:40:54,258 --> 00:40:56,674
then sail for Dragonstone.

608
00:40:56,675 --> 00:40:59,591
Have you forgotten what
happened to our grandfather?

609
00:40:59,592 --> 00:41:01,798
The Mad King invited
him to King's Landing

610
00:41:01,799 --> 00:41:04,090
- and roasted him alive.
- I know that.

611
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:07,215
She is here to reclaim the Iron
Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.

612
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:09,215
The North is one of
those seven kingdoms.

613
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:12,048
This isn't an invitation; it's a trap.

614
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:15,340
It could be, but I don't
believe Tyrion would do that.

615
00:41:15,341 --> 00:41:17,716
You know him. He's a good man.

616
00:41:17,717 --> 00:41:21,549
Your Grace, with respect, I
must agree with Lady Sansa.

617
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:24,632
I remember the Mad King all too well.

618
00:41:24,633 --> 00:41:27,382
A Targaryen cannot be trusted.

619
00:41:27,383 --> 00:41:29,591
- Nor can a Lannister.
- Yeah!

620
00:41:29,592 --> 00:41:33,048
Aye. We called your brother king.

621
00:41:33,049 --> 00:41:36,965
And then he rode south
and lost his kingdom.

622
00:41:36,966 --> 00:41:40,757
Winter is here, Your Grace.

623
00:41:40,758 --> 00:41:43,632
We need the King in
the North in the North.

624
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:46,966
Aye!

625
00:41:55,383 --> 00:41:57,717
You all crowned me your king.

626
00:41:59,592 --> 00:42:01,923
I never wanted it.

627
00:42:01,924 --> 00:42:04,382
I never asked for it.

628
00:42:04,383 --> 00:42:08,674
But I accepted it because
the North is my home.

629
00:42:08,675 --> 00:42:12,965
It's part of me, and I will
never stop fighting for it,

630
00:42:12,966 --> 00:42:14,383
no matter the odds.

631
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:19,049
But the odds are against us.

632
00:42:22,216 --> 00:42:25,257
None of you have seen the
Army of the Dead. None of you.

633
00:42:25,258 --> 00:42:29,299
We can never hope to defeat them alone.

634
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,300
We need allies, powerful allies.

635
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:37,133
I know it's a risk.

636
00:42:38,924 --> 00:42:40,340
But I have to take it.

637
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:43,090
Then send an emissary.
Don't go yourself.

638
00:42:43,091 --> 00:42:44,632
Daenerys is a queen.

639
00:42:44,633 --> 00:42:46,965
Only a king can convince her to help us.

640
00:42:46,966 --> 00:42:48,757
It has to be me.

641
00:42:48,758 --> 00:42:50,716
You're abandoning your people!

642
00:42:50,717 --> 00:42:52,507
You're abandoning your home.

643
00:42:52,508 --> 00:42:54,424
I'm leaving both in good hands.

644
00:42:54,425 --> 00:42:55,841
- Whose?
- Yours.

645
00:42:57,883 --> 00:42:59,340
You are my sister.

646
00:42:59,341 --> 00:43:01,424
You're the only Stark in Winterfell.

647
00:43:01,425 --> 00:43:05,341
Until I return, the North is yours.

648
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,467
I delivered his bones myself.

649
00:43:32,008 --> 00:43:33,632
Presented them to Lady Catelyn

650
00:43:33,633 --> 00:43:36,133
as a gesture of goodwill
from Tyrion Lannister.

651
00:43:37,467 --> 00:43:38,966
Seems like a lifetime ago.

652
00:43:40,675 --> 00:43:43,300
Do give Lord Tyrion my
best when you see him.

653
00:43:46,717 --> 00:43:48,674
I was sorry when he died.

654
00:43:48,675 --> 00:43:52,383
Your father and I had our differences,
but he loved Cat very much.

655
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,592
So did I.

656
00:43:58,883 --> 00:44:01,049
She wasn't fond of you, was she?

657
00:44:02,966 --> 00:44:06,008
Well, it appears she
vastly underestimated you.

658
00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:09,466
Your father and brothers are gone,

659
00:44:09,467 --> 00:44:11,508
yet here you stand, King in the North.

660
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:15,216
Last best hope against the coming storm.

661
00:44:20,341 --> 00:44:22,383
You don't belong down here.

662
00:44:23,758 --> 00:44:25,175
Forgive me.

663
00:44:26,966 --> 00:44:30,424
We haven't ever talked... properly.

664
00:44:30,425 --> 00:44:31,924
I wanted to remedy that.

665
00:44:33,258 --> 00:44:35,091
I have nothing to say to you.

666
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:39,174
Not even "thank you"?

667
00:44:39,175 --> 00:44:43,424
If it weren't for me, you'd have
been slaughtered on that battlefield.

668
00:44:43,425 --> 00:44:45,114
You have many enemies, my king,

669
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:46,799
but I swear to you, I'm not one of them.

670
00:44:49,383 --> 00:44:51,466
I love Sansa,

671
00:44:51,467 --> 00:44:53,132
as I loved her mother.

672
00:45:03,425 --> 00:45:06,966
Touch my sister, and
I'll kill you myself.

673
00:45:32,841 --> 00:45:34,592
- Ready?
- Ready?

674
00:45:38,258 --> 00:45:39,633
Ready!

675
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:44,258
Come on.

676
00:45:47,758 --> 00:45:50,008
- Yah!
- Come on!

677
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,923
Nymeria?

678
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:58,633
Nymeria, it's me, Arya.

679
00:48:03,717 --> 00:48:05,966
I'm heading north, girl.

680
00:48:08,467 --> 00:48:11,008
Back to Winterfell.
I'm finally going home.

681
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:15,799
Come with me.

682
00:48:26,008 --> 00:48:27,425
Come with me.

683
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:57,175
That's not you.

684
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:16,007
You can't have them all. It's not fair.

685
00:49:16,008 --> 00:49:17,424
I'm oldest.

686
00:49:17,425 --> 00:49:19,549
Mama will want Cersei for herself.

687
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,549
She's not my mama.

688
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:23,632
You can have Cersei.

689
00:49:23,633 --> 00:49:26,174
I want the Mountain.

690
00:49:26,175 --> 00:49:28,299
The Mountain killed Father.

691
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,048
He'll crush you with one hand.

692
00:49:30,049 --> 00:49:32,798
Father got careless.
That's what Mama says.

693
00:49:32,799 --> 00:49:35,007
Will you shut up about Mama?

694
00:49:35,008 --> 00:49:36,591
"Mama, Mama, Mama."

695
00:49:36,592 --> 00:49:40,466
Maybe I'll kill you both
before we take King's Landing.

696
00:49:40,467 --> 00:49:42,008
And then I won't have to share.

697
00:49:44,508 --> 00:49:45,717
"Mama!"

698
00:49:47,758 --> 00:49:49,716
How can you drink this piss?

699
00:49:49,717 --> 00:49:51,840
When we reach Sunspear,

700
00:49:51,841 --> 00:49:54,382
I'll treat you to a Dornish red.

701
00:49:54,383 --> 00:49:56,798
The best in the world.

702
00:49:56,799 --> 00:49:58,215
Have you ever been to Dorne?

703
00:49:58,216 --> 00:50:00,215
A few times.

704
00:50:00,216 --> 00:50:01,591
Never stayed long.

705
00:50:01,592 --> 00:50:03,133
A boy in every port?

706
00:50:04,258 --> 00:50:05,717
A boy, a girl.

707
00:50:07,258 --> 00:50:08,633
Depends on the port.

708
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,467
Could we get some more?

709
00:50:15,758 --> 00:50:17,632
I thought it wasn't for you.

710
00:50:17,633 --> 00:50:19,924
I'm developing a taste for it.

711
00:50:21,467 --> 00:50:23,717
- He's not your servant.
- It's fine.

712
00:50:25,675 --> 00:50:30,424
So, you're going to be
Queen of the Iron Islands.

713
00:50:30,425 --> 00:50:32,257
Once I kill my uncle.

714
00:50:32,258 --> 00:50:34,716
And what will you be, handsome?

715
00:50:34,717 --> 00:50:36,424
Whatever my queen commands.

716
00:50:36,425 --> 00:50:40,257
He'll be my advisor, my protector.

717
00:50:40,258 --> 00:50:42,507
Oh, I see.

718
00:50:42,508 --> 00:50:43,924
Your protector.

719
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:48,215
So, if someone gets too close to you...

720
00:50:48,216 --> 00:50:50,007
He might have to intervene.

721
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:51,798
To hold that person back.

722
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:54,467
Until they've made
their intentions known.

723
00:50:57,841 --> 00:50:59,758
Why are you standing all
the way over there, then?

724
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,382
A foreign invasion is underway.

725
00:51:03,383 --> 00:51:05,133
Leave him be.

726
00:51:08,383 --> 00:51:10,508
Seems like you don't need a protector.

727
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,425
Stay here.

728
00:51:20,425 --> 00:51:23,383
We're under attack!

729
00:51:45,675 --> 00:51:47,133
Euron.

730
00:52:55,049 --> 00:52:57,383
You mother's below deck. Keep her safe.

731
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,965
Aah!

732
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,799
Yah!

733
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:12,567
Aah!

734
00:54:30,717 --> 00:54:31,841
Yah!

735
00:54:33,508 --> 00:54:34,583
Yah!

736
00:54:53,049 --> 00:54:54,549
Kill us.

737
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:56,008
Get it over with.

738
00:55:20,758 --> 00:55:22,216
Give your uncle a kiss.

739
00:55:59,008 --> 00:56:00,966
Little Theon!

740
00:56:15,049 --> 00:56:17,966
Ah, come on, you cockless coward.

741
00:56:21,633 --> 00:56:23,716
I have her.

742
00:56:23,717 --> 00:56:25,300
Come and get her.

743
00:59:19,892 --> 00:59:22,432
I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms.

744
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:23,600
And I will.

745
00:59:26,098 --> 00:59:29,098
The war's already begun.
I've drawn first blood.

746
00:59:29,932 --> 00:59:31,098
Cersei will be ready.

747
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,807
They know we're coming.
