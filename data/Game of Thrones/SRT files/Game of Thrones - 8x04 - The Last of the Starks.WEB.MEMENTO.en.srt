1
00:00:02,175 --> 00:00:03,591
Who would you say is the father?

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:05,092
You.

3
00:00:06,134 --> 00:00:08,633
I'm going to put a prince
in your belly.

4
00:00:10,925 --> 00:00:14,383
Our queen has a keen sense
of poetic justice.

5
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:15,883
What would she do for the man

6
00:00:15,967 --> 00:00:18,092
who rids her
of her treasonous brothers?

7
00:00:18,967 --> 00:00:21,466
My name...
my real name...

8
00:00:22,134 --> 00:00:23,799
is Aegon Targaryen.

9
00:00:24,259 --> 00:00:25,341
It's true, Dany.

10
00:00:25,842 --> 00:00:27,009
If it were true...

11
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:29,092
you'd have a claim to the Iron Throne.

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,800
She doesn't like your queen, does she?

13
00:00:32,217 --> 00:00:33,842
She's defending our family.

14
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:35,508
I'm her family, too.

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,259
Don't forget that.

17
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:23,591
We're here to say goodbye
to our brothers and sisters.

18
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,925
To our fathers and mothers.

19
00:05:28,758 --> 00:05:29,883
To our friends.

20
00:05:31,508 --> 00:05:33,341
Our fellow men and women

21
00:05:33,425 --> 00:05:36,050
who set aside their differences...

22
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:38,967
to fight together...

23
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:43,134
and die together

24
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,175
so that others might live.

25
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:50,092
Everyone in this world

26
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:52,967
owes them a debt
that can never be repaid.

27
00:05:54,425 --> 00:05:57,341
It is our duty and our honor

28
00:05:57,425 --> 00:06:00,633
to keep them alive in memory...

29
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,508
for those who come after us...

30
00:06:04,717 --> 00:06:06,633
and those who come after them...

31
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:11,508
for as long as men draw breath.

32
00:06:13,425 --> 00:06:16,925
They were the shields
that guarded the realms of men.

33
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,134
And we shall never see
their like again.

34
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,259
To your health.

35
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:22,717
Have you seen Arya?

36
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,092
You can still smell the burning bodies,

37
00:09:26,175 --> 00:09:27,675
and that's where your head is at.

38
00:09:27,758 --> 00:09:30,758
- I just want to thank her for--
- I'm sure you do.

39
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:32,092
Look, it's not about that.

40
00:09:32,175 --> 00:09:33,925
Of course it's about that, you twat.

41
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:35,092
Why shouldn't it be?

42
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,383
The dead are dead. You're not.

43
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,217
Gendry.

44
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:57,050
That's right, isn't it?

45
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,633
Yes, Your Grace.

46
00:10:04,717 --> 00:10:06,925
You're Robert Baratheon's son.

47
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,259
You are aware
he took my family's throne

48
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:17,675
and tried to have me murdered?

49
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:21,300
I didn't even know he was my
father until after he was dead.

50
00:10:21,383 --> 00:10:24,591
Yes, he's dead.

51
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:26,259
His brothers are too.

52
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:30,383
So who's Lord of Storm's End now?

53
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:33,383
I don't know, Your Grace.

54
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,300
Does anyone?

55
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:47,967
I think you should be
Lord of Storm's End.

56
00:10:53,675 --> 00:10:54,925
I can't be. I'm a bastard.

57
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:59,508
No, you are Lord
Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End,

58
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:02,758
the lawful son of Robert Baratheon.

59
00:11:02,842 --> 00:11:05,591
Because that is what I have made you.

60
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:18,550
To Lord Gendry Baratheon
of Storm's End.

61
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:20,842
To Gendry!

62
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:23,134
Lord Gendry!

63
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:25,134
Gendry!

64
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,633
- Gendry!
- Gendry!

65
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,300
Lord Gendry!

66
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:33,550
Gendry!

67
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,591
That's easy, isn't it?

68
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:44,050
- A fitting reward for a hero.
- Uh, hold on.

69
00:11:44,134 --> 00:11:47,925
And a Lord of Storm's End
who will be forever loyal to you.

70
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:49,842
- Come, my lord.
- See?

71
00:11:49,925 --> 00:11:52,300
You're not the only one who's clever.

72
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:04,967
I have to go down
and get another barrel.

73
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,175
We fought dead things
and lived to talk about it.

74
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:14,466
If this isn't the time to drink,
when is?

75
00:12:24,758 --> 00:12:26,300
The last time I saw her,

76
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:29,675
I told her I'd kill her
if I ever saw her again.

77
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:32,508
- I'm sure you had your reasons.
- I did.

78
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:35,050
- I do.
- So did you?

79
00:12:37,217 --> 00:12:39,134
Never got the chance.

80
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,717
She did it to herself.

81
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:44,883
Or her god did it to her.

82
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:49,092
Lord of Light.

83
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:53,466
We play his game for him,
we fight his war and win,

84
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,175
and then

85
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:56,550
he fucks off.

86
00:12:56,633 --> 00:13:00,009
No signs, no blessings.
Who knows what he wants?

87
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:03,591
I don't imagine
thinking about that subject

88
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:05,466
will leave you any happier than before.

89
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,717
And what if I'm not trying to be happy?

90
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,175
Then you're in luck.

91
00:13:13,675 --> 00:13:16,092
We may have defeated them,

92
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:19,092
but we still have us to contend with.

93
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,134
Thank you. I feel much better.

94
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:40,800
More ale!

95
00:13:43,383 --> 00:13:44,717
This is clever.

96
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:48,591
Even better than the saddle
I designed for you.

97
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:52,217
It's the same as the one
Daeron Targaryen built

98
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,967
for his crippled nephew 120 years ago.

99
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,883
I liked that one.

100
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:01,134
You know our history
better than anyone.

101
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:04,341
That will be useful
as Lord of Winterfell.

102
00:14:04,425 --> 00:14:06,383
I'm not Lord of Winterfell.

103
00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:09,466
You're the only surviving
trueborn son of Ned Stark.

104
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:15,925
You don't want it.

105
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:18,425
I don't really want anymore.

106
00:14:20,466 --> 00:14:21,800
I envy you.

107
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,633
You shouldn't envy me.

108
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:30,134
Mostly I live in the past.

109
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:36,925
- All of it.
- Go on.

110
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,591
- No, not in one go.
- Go on. I believe in you.

111
00:14:39,675 --> 00:14:41,717
We have to celebrate our victory.

112
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,092
Vomiting is not celebrating.

113
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,967
Yes, it is.

114
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,341
Ah!

115
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:48,925
To the Dragon Queen!

116
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:54,466
To Arya Stark, the hero of Winterfell!

117
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,259
- Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah!
- Drink!

118
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:14,842
I'm fine!

119
00:15:28,217 --> 00:15:29,217
Your turn.

120
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,883
Um...

121
00:15:31,758 --> 00:15:34,883
You are an only child.

122
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:37,633
- I told you I was.
- You didn't.

123
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:40,550
- I did.
- I surmised it.

124
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:42,175
Drink.

125
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,425
Go again.

126
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:45,842
Why does he get to go again?

127
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:47,800
Because it's my game.

128
00:15:47,883 --> 00:15:51,508
You have danced with Renly Baratheon.

129
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,383
No.

130
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:55,842
Drink.

131
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:58,758
The other way around!

132
00:15:58,842 --> 00:16:01,050
I saw him riding that thing.

133
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:03,883
- We all did.
- No. No.

134
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:07,217
I saw him riding that thing.

135
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,300
- That's right, you did.
- I did.

136
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:13,134
That's why we all agreed to follow him.

137
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:15,425
That's the kind of man he is.

138
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:18,591
He's little...

139
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:21,175
...but he's strong.

140
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:24,134
Strong enough to befriend an enemy

141
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,466
and get murdered for it!

142
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,842
Most people get bloody murdered,

143
00:16:28,925 --> 00:16:30,134
they stay that way.

144
00:16:30,217 --> 00:16:31,842
Not this one.

145
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,633
Yeah, I didn't have much say in that.

146
00:16:35,717 --> 00:16:38,758
Ah! He comes back
and keeps fighting.

147
00:16:38,842 --> 00:16:42,341
Here, north of the Wall,
and then back here again.

148
00:16:42,425 --> 00:16:45,883
He keeps fighting.
He keeps fighting.

149
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:48,883
He climbed on a fucking dragon
and fought.

150
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,550
What kind of person
climbs on a fucking dragon?

151
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:54,883
A madman or a king!

152
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:12,217
- Drink.
- Drink.

153
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,217
Drink.

154
00:17:43,967 --> 00:17:45,050
Wrong!

155
00:17:45,134 --> 00:17:47,217
Wrong, wrong, wrong! Drink!

156
00:17:49,341 --> 00:17:50,508
Mm!

157
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,842
You were married. Before Sansa.

158
00:17:54,717 --> 00:17:56,009
Drink.

159
00:18:01,134 --> 00:18:03,259
You're drinking wine,
but you prefer ale!

160
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:04,259
No!

161
00:18:18,175 --> 00:18:19,217
You're a virgin.

162
00:18:24,758 --> 00:18:26,466
That's a statement about the present.

163
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,466
At no point in the past,
up until this very moment,

164
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,550
have you slept with a man.

165
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:34,217
Or a woman.

166
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:42,383
I have to piss.

167
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:46,466
We did it!
We faced those icy fucks.

168
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,134
Looked right into their blue eyes,

169
00:18:49,217 --> 00:18:50,591
and here we are.

170
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,508
Now, which one of you cowards
shit in my pants?

171
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:01,341
Please pardon me for a moment.

172
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:22,383
Drink it!

173
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,967
And after all that,

174
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,591
this fucker comes north
and takes her from me.

175
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:51,591
Just takes her, like that.

176
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:55,217
I mean it, Clegane.

177
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,883
My heart is broken.

178
00:19:56,967 --> 00:19:58,217
Don't touch me.

179
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,633
You can touch me.

180
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:02,967
I'm not afraid of wildlings.

181
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,800
Maybe you should be.

182
00:20:09,134 --> 00:20:10,425
Well, Clegane...

183
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,050
it's time to drown our sorrows.

184
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:15,800
I'm not done with my drink.

185
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,800
You saved the day.

186
00:20:18,883 --> 00:20:20,259
You owe me one.

187
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:23,842
- Don't forget that.
- For the rest of my days.

188
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:26,425
Are you ready now?

189
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:28,633
This is my drink.

190
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,883
All right!

191
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:46,675
She could have made you
happy, for a little while.

192
00:20:49,633 --> 00:20:52,175
There's only one thing
that'll make me happy.

193
00:20:53,175 --> 00:20:54,092
And what's that?

194
00:20:54,175 --> 00:20:56,550
That's my fucking business.

195
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:04,092
Used to be you couldn't look at me.

196
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:06,425
That was a long time ago.

197
00:21:06,508 --> 00:21:09,217
I've seen much worse than you
since then.

198
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,259
Yes, I've heard.

199
00:21:11,341 --> 00:21:13,092
Heard you were broken in.

200
00:21:14,092 --> 00:21:15,717
Heard you were broken in rough.

201
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,175
And he got what he deserved.

202
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:20,591
I gave it to him.

203
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,009
How?

204
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,425
Hounds.

205
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:30,925
You've changed, Little Bird.

206
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:38,758
None of it would have happened

207
00:21:38,842 --> 00:21:40,675
if you'd left King's Landing with me.

208
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:43,758
No Littlefinger, no Ramsay...

209
00:21:45,383 --> 00:21:46,633
none of it.

210
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:57,550
Without Littlefinger,
and Ramsay and the rest,

211
00:21:57,633 --> 00:22:00,134
I would have stayed
a Little Bird all my life.

212
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:24,758
- Hey!
- Pour another one.

213
00:22:37,175 --> 00:22:38,341
Don't shoot.

214
00:22:41,383 --> 00:22:44,259
It's nighttime, it's freezing,
and everyone's celebrating.

215
00:22:44,341 --> 00:22:46,842
You should be celebrating with them.

216
00:22:46,925 --> 00:22:48,300
I am celebrating.

217
00:22:50,175 --> 00:22:52,134
Yeah, I am too.

218
00:22:54,383 --> 00:22:56,300
I'm not Gendry Rivers anymore.

219
00:22:56,383 --> 00:22:59,758
I'm Gendry Baratheon,
Lord of Storm's End.

220
00:22:59,842 --> 00:23:02,175
By order of the queen.

221
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,175
Congratulations.

222
00:23:08,466 --> 00:23:10,425
I don't know how to be
lord of anything.

223
00:23:10,508 --> 00:23:12,134
I hardly know how to use a fork.

224
00:23:12,217 --> 00:23:14,134
All I know is that you're beautiful,

225
00:23:14,217 --> 00:23:15,341
and I love you,

226
00:23:15,425 --> 00:23:17,259
and none of it will be worth anything

227
00:23:17,341 --> 00:23:18,508
if you're not with me.

228
00:23:19,842 --> 00:23:20,842
So be with me.

229
00:23:25,341 --> 00:23:28,967
Be my wife.
Be the Lady of Storm's End.

230
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,466
You'll be a wonderful lord,

231
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,591
and any lady
would be lucky to have you.

232
00:23:57,967 --> 00:23:59,425
But I'm not a lady.

233
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:02,217
I never have been.

234
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,550
That's not me.

235
00:24:31,717 --> 00:24:33,092
You didn't drink.

236
00:24:35,925 --> 00:24:38,967
- I didn't drink?
- In the game.

237
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,217
- I drank.
- In the game. This is Dornish.

238
00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:48,633
This is not the game.
This is only drinking.

239
00:24:49,675 --> 00:24:50,800
Suit yourself.

240
00:25:01,758 --> 00:25:04,134
You keep it warm enough in here.

241
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:10,508
It's the first thing I learnt
when I came to the North.

242
00:25:10,591 --> 00:25:11,967
Keep your fire going.

243
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,383
Every time you leave the room,
put more wood on.

244
00:25:14,466 --> 00:25:17,092
That's very diligent.
Very responsible.

245
00:25:17,175 --> 00:25:19,050
- Piss off.
- You know the first thing

246
00:25:19,134 --> 00:25:20,925
I learned in the North?

247
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:23,092
I hate the fucking North.

248
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:25,466
It grows on you.

249
00:25:27,175 --> 00:25:29,800
I don't want things growing on me.

250
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:34,383
How about Tormund Giantsbane?

251
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,967
Has he grown on you?

252
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:39,633
He was very sad when you left.

253
00:25:41,134 --> 00:25:42,967
You sound quite jealous.

254
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,300
I do, don't I?

255
00:25:52,341 --> 00:25:54,175
It's bloody hot in here.

256
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:05,341
Oh, move aside.

257
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:12,050
What are you doing?

258
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,508
I'm taking your shirt off.

259
00:27:01,383 --> 00:27:03,717
I've never slept with a knight before.

260
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:07,675
I've never slept with anyone before.

261
00:27:09,591 --> 00:27:12,300
Then you have to drink.
Those are the rules.

262
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:14,758
I told you--

263
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:31,758
Are you drunk?

264
00:27:36,425 --> 00:27:37,383
No.

265
00:27:42,425 --> 00:27:43,717
Only a little.

266
00:27:53,883 --> 00:27:55,591
I didn't know Ser Jorah well...

267
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,259
but I know this.

268
00:27:59,967 --> 00:28:01,883
If he could have chosen a way to die,

269
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:03,967
it would have been protecting you.

270
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:06,009
He loved me.

271
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:11,092
And I couldn't love him back.

272
00:28:13,175 --> 00:28:14,925
Not the way he wanted.

273
00:28:18,383 --> 00:28:20,009
Not the way I love you.

274
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:24,591
Is that all right?

275
00:29:03,883 --> 00:29:05,967
I wish you'd never told me.

276
00:29:07,217 --> 00:29:10,009
If I didn't know,
I'd be happy right now.

277
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:12,675
I try to forget.

278
00:29:14,341 --> 00:29:15,717
Tonight I did for a while,

279
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,591
and then I saw them
gathered around you.

280
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,425
I saw the way they looked at you.

281
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:24,883
I know that look.

282
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:30,050
So many people have looked at me
that way, but never here.

283
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:31,717
Never on this side of the sea.

284
00:29:33,175 --> 00:29:34,466
I told you I don't want it.

285
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,092
It doesn't matter what you want.

286
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:38,967
You didn't want to be
King in the North.

287
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,633
What happens when they demand
you press your claim,

288
00:29:41,717 --> 00:29:43,217
and take what is mine?

289
00:29:46,675 --> 00:29:48,508
I'll refuse.

290
00:29:48,591 --> 00:29:51,134
You are my queen. I don't know
what else I can say.

291
00:29:51,217 --> 00:29:53,425
You can say nothing.

292
00:29:53,508 --> 00:29:54,967
To anyone, ever.

293
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,050
Never tell them who you really are.

294
00:29:57,134 --> 00:29:59,550
Swear your brother
and Samwell Tarly to secrecy,

295
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:00,842
and tell no one else.

296
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:02,550
Or it will take on a life of its own

297
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,341
and you won't be able to control it

298
00:30:04,425 --> 00:30:05,633
or what it does to people.

299
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:08,217
No matter how many times
you bend the knee,

300
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,259
no matter what you swear.

301
00:30:15,425 --> 00:30:18,883
I want it to be the way it was
between us.

302
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:29,883
I have to tell Sansa and Arya.

303
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:36,341
Sansa will want to see me gone
and you on the Iron Throne.

304
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:38,092
She won't.

305
00:30:38,175 --> 00:30:41,217
She's not the girl you grew up with.

306
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,591
Not after what she's seen,

307
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,300
not after what they've done to her.

308
00:30:49,675 --> 00:30:51,550
I owe them the truth.

309
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:54,508
Even if the truth destroys us?

310
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:56,300
- It won't.
- It will.

311
00:30:58,842 --> 00:31:00,633
I've never begged for anything...

312
00:31:01,883 --> 00:31:04,050
but I'm begging you.

313
00:31:04,134 --> 00:31:07,134
Don't do this. Please.

314
00:31:13,758 --> 00:31:15,134
You are my queen.

315
00:31:16,717 --> 00:31:18,591
Nothing will change that.

316
00:31:21,508 --> 00:31:23,217
And they are my family.

317
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,842
We can live together.

318
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:33,717
We can.

319
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:37,675
I've just told you how.

320
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,675
Half are gone.

321
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:21,009
The Northmen as well.

322
00:32:27,383 --> 00:32:30,550
And the Golden Company
has arrived in King's Landing,

323
00:32:30,633 --> 00:32:32,633
courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet.

324
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:36,425
The balance has grown
distressingly even.

325
00:32:36,508 --> 00:32:39,300
When the people find out
what we have done for them,

326
00:32:39,383 --> 00:32:40,633
that we saved them--

327
00:32:40,717 --> 00:32:43,050
Cersei will make sure
they don't believe it.

328
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,675
We will hit her hard.

329
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:48,967
We will rip her out root and stem.

330
00:32:50,425 --> 00:32:53,050
The objective here is to remove Cersei

331
00:32:53,134 --> 00:32:55,800
without destroying King's Landing.

332
00:32:58,925 --> 00:33:02,758
Thankfully,
she's losing allies by the day.

333
00:33:02,842 --> 00:33:05,675
Yara Greyjoy has retaken
the Iron Islands

334
00:33:05,758 --> 00:33:07,050
in her queen's name.

335
00:33:07,134 --> 00:33:09,800
The new Prince of Dorne
pledges his support.

336
00:33:09,883 --> 00:33:11,925
No matter how many lords
turn against her,

337
00:33:12,009 --> 00:33:13,800
as long as she sits on the Iron Throne,

338
00:33:13,883 --> 00:33:16,591
she can call herself
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

339
00:33:18,925 --> 00:33:20,675
We need the capital.

340
00:33:20,758 --> 00:33:22,508
I watched the people of King's Landing

341
00:33:22,591 --> 00:33:24,883
rebel against their king
when they were hungry,

342
00:33:24,967 --> 00:33:27,175
and that was before winter began.

343
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:30,800
Give them the opportunity
and they will cast Cersei aside.

344
00:33:32,508 --> 00:33:34,883
We'll surround the city.

345
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:37,217
If the Iron Fleet
tries to ferry in more food,

346
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,383
the dragons will destroy them.

347
00:33:39,466 --> 00:33:41,883
If the Lannisters
and the Golden Company attack,

348
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:43,633
we'll defeat them in the field.

349
00:33:43,717 --> 00:33:47,383
Once the people see
that Cersei is our only enemy,

350
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:49,466
her reign is over.

351
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,092
All right.

352
00:33:56,175 --> 00:33:59,300
The men we have left are exhausted.

353
00:33:59,383 --> 00:34:00,591
Many of them are wounded.

354
00:34:00,675 --> 00:34:02,550
They'll fight better if they have time

355
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:04,009
to rest and recuperate.

356
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,508
How long do you suggest?

357
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:09,175
I can't say for certain,

358
00:34:09,259 --> 00:34:11,300
not without talking to the officers.

359
00:34:14,675 --> 00:34:17,550
I came north to fight alongside you

360
00:34:17,633 --> 00:34:20,175
at great cost to my armies and myself.

361
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:24,259
Now that the time has come
to reciprocate,

362
00:34:24,341 --> 00:34:26,134
you want to postpone.

363
00:34:26,217 --> 00:34:29,092
It's not just our people.
It's yours.

364
00:34:29,175 --> 00:34:30,800
You want to throw them into a war

365
00:34:30,883 --> 00:34:32,425
they're not ready to fight?

366
00:34:32,508 --> 00:34:34,217
The longer I leave my enemies alone,

367
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,800
the stronger they become.

368
00:34:39,341 --> 00:34:42,883
The Northern forces
will honor their promises

369
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:44,259
and their allegiance

370
00:34:44,341 --> 00:34:46,842
to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

371
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:54,050
What you command, we will obey.

372
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,383
So...

373
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:03,383
if all are in agreement...

374
00:35:03,466 --> 00:35:06,300
Jon and Ser Davos
will ride down the Kingsroad

375
00:35:06,383 --> 00:35:07,758
with the Northern troops

376
00:35:07,842 --> 00:35:10,383
and the bulk of the remaining
Dothraki and Unsullied.

377
00:35:10,466 --> 00:35:12,800
A smaller group of us
will ride to White Harbor,

378
00:35:12,883 --> 00:35:14,800
and sail from there to Dragonstone

379
00:35:14,883 --> 00:35:18,591
with our queen and her dragons
accompanying us from above.

380
00:35:18,675 --> 00:35:21,341
Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here,

381
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:23,717
as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell.

382
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,675
We have won the Great War.

383
00:35:29,675 --> 00:35:31,425
Now we will win the Last War.

384
00:35:32,717 --> 00:35:34,717
In all Seven Kingdoms,

385
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,591
men will live without fear and cruelty

386
00:35:38,675 --> 00:35:40,092
under their rightful queen.

387
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,717
We need a word.

388
00:35:58,842 --> 00:36:01,800
You understand we'd all be dead
if not for her.

389
00:36:01,883 --> 00:36:04,175
We'd be corpses
marching down to King's Landing.

390
00:36:04,259 --> 00:36:05,675
Arya's the one
that killed the Night King.

391
00:36:05,758 --> 00:36:07,842
Her men gave their lives
defending Winterfell--

392
00:36:07,925 --> 00:36:09,508
And we will never forget them.

393
00:36:09,591 --> 00:36:11,466
That doesn't mean that I want
to kneel to someone who--

394
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:14,217
I swore myself and the North
to her cause.

395
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,842
I respect that.

396
00:36:18,466 --> 00:36:20,134
You respect it?

397
00:36:20,842 --> 00:36:22,591
We needed her.

398
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:26,591
We needed her army, her dragons.

399
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:30,175
You did the right thing.

400
00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:32,675
And we're doing the right thing
telling you

401
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:34,300
we don't trust your queen.

402
00:36:36,217 --> 00:36:38,508
- You don't know her yet.
- I'll never know her.

403
00:36:38,591 --> 00:36:39,883
She's not one of us.

404
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:41,883
If you only trust the people
you grew up with,

405
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:43,300
you won't make many allies.

406
00:36:43,383 --> 00:36:44,925
That's all right.

407
00:36:45,009 --> 00:36:47,134
I don't need many allies.

408
00:36:47,217 --> 00:36:49,466
- Arya...
- We're family.

409
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,009
The four of us.

410
00:36:53,092 --> 00:36:54,800
The last of the Starks.

411
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:00,300
I've never been a Stark.

412
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:03,050
You are.

413
00:37:03,134 --> 00:37:06,134
You're just as much
Ned Stark's child as any of us.

414
00:37:06,217 --> 00:37:08,092
You're my brother.

415
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:10,675
Not my half-brother
or my bastard brother.

416
00:37:11,508 --> 00:37:13,050
My brother.

417
00:37:20,591 --> 00:37:22,341
It's your choice.

418
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:31,717
I need to tell you something.

419
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:36,717
But you have to swear
you'll never tell another soul.

420
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:41,341
What is it?

421
00:37:42,633 --> 00:37:45,675
You have to swear it,
before I tell you.

422
00:37:45,758 --> 00:37:47,341
How can I promise to keep a secret

423
00:37:47,425 --> 00:37:48,967
if I don't even know what it is?

424
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,717
Because we're family.

425
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,758
Swear it.

426
00:37:58,092 --> 00:37:59,508
I swear it.

427
00:38:04,175 --> 00:38:05,175
I swear it.

428
00:38:13,217 --> 00:38:14,508
Tell them.

429
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,591
So she's going to stay here with you?

430
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:33,259
She's sworn to protect
the Stark girls, so...

431
00:38:36,591 --> 00:38:38,050
Say something snide.

432
00:38:39,259 --> 00:38:40,259
I'm happy.

433
00:38:40,341 --> 00:38:42,092
I'm happy that you're happy.

434
00:38:45,009 --> 00:38:48,383
I'm happy that you'll finally
have to climb for it.

435
00:38:50,425 --> 00:38:53,717
Do you know how long I've waited
to tell tall-person jokes?

436
00:38:54,925 --> 00:38:57,217
To climbing mountains.

437
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,758
To climbing mountains.

438
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:04,341
- What's she like down there?
- What?

439
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,383
That's not your concern.

440
00:39:06,466 --> 00:39:09,009
I haven't been with a woman for years.

441
00:39:09,092 --> 00:39:10,591
- Give me a morsel.
- You're a dog.

442
00:39:10,675 --> 00:39:12,550
I am the Imp, and I demand to know.

443
00:39:12,633 --> 00:39:14,425
I knew you were fucking her.

444
00:39:16,341 --> 00:39:18,259
A pair of tall, blond toffs.

445
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:20,009
Must be like looking in the mirror.

446
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:21,925
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

447
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,300
Where's your drink?

448
00:39:25,383 --> 00:39:27,508
What are you--
What are you doing up North?

449
00:39:27,591 --> 00:39:29,050
What are you doing with that?

450
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:30,675
Oh, this?

451
00:39:30,758 --> 00:39:31,800
This is for you.

452
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,383
For both of you.

453
00:39:34,466 --> 00:39:36,550
You're supposed to be south.

454
00:39:36,633 --> 00:39:38,550
You boys are a pair
of gold-plated cunts.

455
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:40,134
- Do you know that?
- That's a bit rude.

456
00:39:40,217 --> 00:39:42,425
Year after year,
I've shoveled Lannister shit,

457
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:45,425
- and what do I have to show?
- You're a knight, thanks to me.

458
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,092
Thanks to me.
And that title's worth as much

459
00:39:47,175 --> 00:39:49,383
as a blond hair
from your brother's ballsack.

460
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:51,050
Power resides where men believe--

461
00:39:51,134 --> 00:39:53,092
Shut your mouth.

462
00:39:53,175 --> 00:39:55,508
- I'm just trying--
- I've never hit a dwarf before,

463
00:39:55,591 --> 00:39:57,466
but say another word
and I will belt you.

464
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,092
See, I don't believe
you'd do that, after all--

465
00:40:00,175 --> 00:40:01,925
You couldn't do it on your best day,

466
00:40:02,009 --> 00:40:03,092
you one-handed fuck.

467
00:40:03,175 --> 00:40:04,758
And your best days are long gone.

468
00:40:04,842 --> 00:40:06,341
You broke my nose!

469
00:40:06,425 --> 00:40:08,134
- I did not break your nose.
- How do you know?

470
00:40:08,217 --> 00:40:10,508
Because I've been breaking noses
since I was your size,

471
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:13,508
and I know what it sounds like.
Now listen.

472
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:16,175
Your sister offered me Riverrun.

473
00:40:16,259 --> 00:40:17,758
Nice big castle, good lands,

474
00:40:17,842 --> 00:40:19,883
plenty of peasants
who do what they're told.

475
00:40:19,967 --> 00:40:22,633
- And you trust Cersei--
- I knew your sister was dead

476
00:40:22,717 --> 00:40:24,508
the second I saw those dragons.

477
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:26,175
Now, your army may be torn to shit,

478
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:28,466
but I'd still bet
on your Dragon Queen to win.

479
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:31,050
And it just so happens
I'm a betting man.

480
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,217
If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.

481
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,717
Mmm, that's good.
Of course, the odds change

482
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,800
if the Dragon Queen's Hand
turns up dead.

483
00:40:41,883 --> 00:40:44,758
Maybe a few of her top generals
get picked off one by one.

484
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,758
- All of a sudden...
- May I speak?

485
00:40:46,842 --> 00:40:49,508
Why not?
Only death will shut you up.

486
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:55,717
We made a deal long ago.
Do you remember?

487
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,967
If anyone offered me money

488
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,300
to kill you, you'd pay me double.

489
00:40:59,383 --> 00:41:00,842
What's double Riverrun?

490
00:41:01,883 --> 00:41:02,883
Highgarden.

491
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,550
You could be Lord of the Reach.

492
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:09,466
- Highgarden? Are you mad?
- It's better than being dead.

493
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,758
He's not going to kill us.

494
00:41:10,842 --> 00:41:12,591
He wouldn't be talking to us if--

495
00:41:15,591 --> 00:41:16,842
The way I see it,

496
00:41:16,925 --> 00:41:19,591
I only need one
of the Lannister brothers alive.

497
00:41:19,675 --> 00:41:21,800
Highgarden will never belong
to a cutthroat.

498
00:41:21,883 --> 00:41:24,009
No? Who were your ancestors,

499
00:41:24,092 --> 00:41:26,259
the ones who made your family rich?

500
00:41:26,341 --> 00:41:27,925
Fancy lads in silk?

501
00:41:28,009 --> 00:41:29,675
They were fucking cutthroats.

502
00:41:29,758 --> 00:41:32,175
That's how all the great houses
started, isn't it?

503
00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:34,675
With a hard bastard
who was good at killing people.

504
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:37,092
Kill a few hundred people,
they make you a lord.

505
00:41:37,175 --> 00:41:39,175
Kill a few thousand,
they make you king.

506
00:41:39,259 --> 00:41:43,675
And then all your cocksucking
grandsons can ruin the family

507
00:41:43,758 --> 00:41:45,300
with their cocksucking ways.

508
00:41:49,134 --> 00:41:50,134
Highgarden.

509
00:41:51,925 --> 00:41:53,466
Give me your word.

510
00:41:55,217 --> 00:41:56,675
You have my word.

511
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,925
None of this means a thing
until we take King's Landing.

512
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,466
We ride south in the morning.

513
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,717
We could use an officer

514
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,050
with knowledge of the city's defenses.

515
00:42:09,134 --> 00:42:10,383
Oh, no.

516
00:42:10,466 --> 00:42:13,050
No, my fighting days are done.

517
00:42:13,134 --> 00:42:16,175
But I still got a few
killing days left, you hear me?

518
00:42:16,259 --> 00:42:18,883
I'll come find you
when the war is done.

519
00:42:18,967 --> 00:42:21,259
Till then, don't die.

520
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:48,175
For fuck's sake.

521
00:42:49,717 --> 00:42:50,800
On your own?

522
00:42:52,009 --> 00:42:53,508
Not anymore.

523
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:56,633
I don't like crowds.

524
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,341
Me neither.

525
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,717
Why not? They all love you now.

526
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,383
You're the big hero.

527
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,134
Don't like heroes.

528
00:43:09,092 --> 00:43:12,550
It must have felt good sticking
a knife in that horned fucker.

529
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:15,550
Felt better than dying.

530
00:43:19,009 --> 00:43:20,717
You're heading to King's Landing?

531
00:43:22,009 --> 00:43:24,425
I have some unfinished business.

532
00:43:25,758 --> 00:43:27,175
Me too.

533
00:43:33,259 --> 00:43:35,383
I don't plan on coming back.

534
00:43:37,758 --> 00:43:39,383
Neither do I.

535
00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:43,383
Gonna leave me to die again
if I get hurt?

536
00:43:45,717 --> 00:43:46,633
Probably.

537
00:44:30,925 --> 00:44:31,883
My lady.

538
00:44:36,175 --> 00:44:38,925
"My lord" is the standard response.

539
00:44:41,341 --> 00:44:42,758
Why her?

540
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,800
You know she loves your brother.

541
00:44:48,883 --> 00:44:51,009
That doesn't mean
she'll be a good queen.

542
00:44:52,217 --> 00:44:54,925
You seem determined to dislike her.

543
00:44:56,383 --> 00:44:57,550
A good relationship

544
00:44:57,633 --> 00:44:58,967
between the Iron Throne and the North

545
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:00,800
has been the core of every peaceful,

546
00:45:00,883 --> 00:45:02,466
prosperous reign we've ever known.

547
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,050
Jon will be Warden of the North,

548
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:06,134
so a good relationship seems likely.

549
00:45:07,842 --> 00:45:11,050
I don't expect him to spend
much time here going forward.

550
00:45:11,134 --> 00:45:13,134
Well, I suppose that's up to him.

551
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:18,842
Sansa, look at me.

552
00:45:24,591 --> 00:45:26,758
With Jon in the capital,

553
00:45:26,842 --> 00:45:29,508
you'll be the true power in the North.

554
00:45:29,591 --> 00:45:31,383
I'd feel much better about the future

555
00:45:31,466 --> 00:45:32,800
if I left here today believing

556
00:45:32,883 --> 00:45:34,466
that you and Daenerys were allies.

557
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:38,300
What are you worried about?
Jon's taking our army with him.

558
00:45:38,383 --> 00:45:40,050
Your queen still has her dragons--

559
00:45:40,134 --> 00:45:41,300
She's your queen too.

560
00:45:48,341 --> 00:45:50,591
You don't have to be her friend.

561
00:45:50,675 --> 00:45:52,591
But why provoke her?

562
00:45:52,675 --> 00:45:54,925
How is that in the best interest
of your family,

563
00:45:55,009 --> 00:45:57,425
- or the North, or--?
- You're afraid of her.

564
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:04,217
Every good ruler
needs to inspire a bit of fear.

565
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,092
I don't want Jon to go down there.

566
00:46:09,175 --> 00:46:12,842
The men in my family
don't do well in the capital.

567
00:46:12,925 --> 00:46:15,633
No, but as your brother once told me,

568
00:46:15,717 --> 00:46:17,092
he's not a Stark.

569
00:46:22,675 --> 00:46:24,050
Are you all right?

570
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:33,134
Her people love her, you've seen that.

571
00:46:33,217 --> 00:46:35,550
You've seen how they fight for her.

572
00:46:35,633 --> 00:46:38,800
She wants to make the world
a better place.

573
00:46:41,134 --> 00:46:43,217
I believe in her.

574
00:46:58,092 --> 00:46:59,425
Tyrion.

575
00:47:02,259 --> 00:47:04,842
What if there's someone else?

576
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:06,550
Someone better?

577
00:47:14,883 --> 00:47:16,925
You're not gonna ride the dragon south?

578
00:47:20,633 --> 00:47:21,800
Just a horse.

579
00:47:23,134 --> 00:47:24,300
Rhaegal needs to heal.

580
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,092
He doesn't need me weighing him down.

581
00:47:26,175 --> 00:47:29,508
You weigh as much as two fleas fucking.

582
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,466
I'm taking the Free Folk home.

583
00:47:33,466 --> 00:47:36,217
We've had enough of the south.

584
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,341
The women down here don't like me.

585
00:47:40,425 --> 00:47:42,591
This is the North, you know.

586
00:47:43,842 --> 00:47:46,259
And the Free Folk are welcome to stay.

587
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,466
It isn't home.

588
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:51,009
We need room to wander.

589
00:47:51,092 --> 00:47:53,175
I'll take them
back through Castle Black

590
00:47:53,259 --> 00:47:55,717
as soon as the winter storms pass.

591
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,466
Back where we belong.

592
00:48:01,425 --> 00:48:03,758
It's where he belongs too.

593
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:06,550
A direwolf has no place in the south.

594
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,175
Will you take him with you?

595
00:48:11,425 --> 00:48:13,383
He'll be happier up there.

596
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:15,717
So would you.

597
00:48:17,717 --> 00:48:20,134
I wish I was going with you.

598
00:48:24,508 --> 00:48:25,800
This is farewell, then.

599
00:48:27,383 --> 00:48:29,050
You never know.

600
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:37,508
You've got the North in you.

601
00:48:39,009 --> 00:48:40,466
The real North.

602
00:49:12,967 --> 00:49:16,134
Yes, well, the nights
have been getting longer

603
00:49:16,217 --> 00:49:18,800
and there wasn't that much
to do in Oldtown.

604
00:49:18,883 --> 00:49:21,508
There's only so many books
a person can read, so we--

605
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:24,300
I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam.

606
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:30,259
If it's a boy, we want to name him Jon.

607
00:49:33,591 --> 00:49:35,092
I hope it's a girl.

608
00:49:53,925 --> 00:49:56,050
You're the best friend I ever had.

609
00:49:58,508 --> 00:50:00,550
You too, Sam.

610
00:51:01,092 --> 00:51:03,383
Think of the past 20 years.

611
00:51:04,383 --> 00:51:07,300
The war, the murder, the misery.

612
00:51:07,383 --> 00:51:09,800
All of it because
Robert Baratheon loved someone

613
00:51:09,883 --> 00:51:11,800
who didn't love him back.

614
00:51:13,883 --> 00:51:15,050
How many others know?

615
00:51:16,842 --> 00:51:19,466
Including us? Eight.

616
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:21,633
Well, then it's not a secret anymore.

617
00:51:21,717 --> 00:51:23,508
It's information.

618
00:51:23,591 --> 00:51:26,925
If a handful of people know now,
hundreds will know soon.

619
00:51:27,009 --> 00:51:28,425
Then what happens?

620
00:51:28,508 --> 00:51:30,092
She loses the North.

621
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,967
She loses the Vale,
Sansa will make sure of that.

622
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:34,466
No, it's worse than that.

623
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:37,300
He has the better claim to the throne.

624
00:51:37,383 --> 00:51:39,591
He doesn't want the throne.

625
00:51:39,675 --> 00:51:42,092
I'm not sure it matters what he wants.

626
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,550
The fact is, people are drawn to him.

627
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:48,341
Wildlings, Northmen.

628
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:51,591
He's a war hero.

629
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:58,217
He loves our queen.

630
00:51:59,758 --> 00:52:01,050
And she loves him.

631
00:52:03,259 --> 00:52:05,675
If we marry them,
they could rule together.

632
00:52:06,717 --> 00:52:07,883
She's his aunt.

633
00:52:07,967 --> 00:52:09,300
That never stopped a Targaryen before.

634
00:52:09,383 --> 00:52:11,092
No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell.

635
00:52:11,175 --> 00:52:13,425
Is marrying your aunt
common in the North?

636
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:17,842
You know our queen better than I do.

637
00:52:17,925 --> 00:52:20,633
Do you think
she wants to share the throne?

638
00:52:20,717 --> 00:52:23,259
She does not like to have
her authority questioned.

639
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:24,591
Something she has in common

640
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:27,259
with every monarch who ever lived.

641
00:52:27,341 --> 00:52:29,134
I worry about her state of mind.

642
00:52:29,217 --> 00:52:31,341
We are advisors to the queen.

643
00:52:31,425 --> 00:52:34,758
Worrying about her state of mind
is our job.

644
00:52:42,717 --> 00:52:44,758
We still have to take King's Landing.

645
00:52:45,925 --> 00:52:48,508
Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all.

646
00:52:48,591 --> 00:52:50,883
That would solve our problems.

647
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:56,883
Get to the skiff. Now!

648
00:54:58,967 --> 00:55:00,425
Spears!

649
00:55:00,508 --> 00:55:02,466
They're coming round again!

650
00:55:11,092 --> 00:55:12,550
Go!

651
00:55:12,633 --> 00:55:13,842
Clear!

652
00:55:13,925 --> 00:55:15,800
Man your stations!

653
00:55:15,883 --> 00:55:17,550
No!

654
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:38,050
- Go! Go!
- Clear!

655
00:56:13,758 --> 00:56:14,842
Missandei?

656
00:56:16,425 --> 00:56:17,675
Missandei!

657
00:56:23,758 --> 00:56:25,175
Missandei!

658
00:56:30,092 --> 00:56:32,092
Our message was well-received, then?

659
00:56:32,175 --> 00:56:35,466
Your people have
heard the Usurper is coming.

660
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:38,050
They are grateful for your protection

661
00:56:38,134 --> 00:56:40,508
within the walls of the Red Keep.

662
00:56:42,758 --> 00:56:44,717
You're certain about the dragon?

663
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,050
I saw it sink beneath the waves.

664
00:56:47,134 --> 00:56:49,383
That must have been glorious.

665
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:53,717
The glory is yours, my queen.

666
00:56:55,217 --> 00:56:57,717
When the war is won,
the Lion shall rule the land,

667
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,466
the Kraken shall rule the sea...

668
00:57:00,842 --> 00:57:04,050
and our child
shall one day rule them all.

669
00:57:20,883 --> 00:57:22,591
She's coming for you.

670
00:57:23,717 --> 00:57:24,925
Of course she is.

671
00:57:27,717 --> 00:57:29,425
Keep the gates open.

672
00:57:29,508 --> 00:57:32,134
If she wants to take the castle,
she'll have to murder

673
00:57:32,217 --> 00:57:34,717
thousands of innocent people first.

674
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,300
So much for
"the Breaker of Chains."

675
00:57:56,842 --> 00:57:59,300
We will storm the city, my queen.

676
00:57:59,383 --> 00:58:02,591
We will kill your enemies.
All of them.

677
00:58:02,675 --> 00:58:03,758
Your Grace.

678
00:58:05,341 --> 00:58:09,009
I promised you I would look you
in the eye and speak directly

679
00:58:09,092 --> 00:58:11,425
if I ever thought
you were making a mistake.

680
00:58:14,967 --> 00:58:17,717
This is a mistake.

681
00:58:20,259 --> 00:58:22,800
You saw my child fall from the sky.

682
00:58:24,425 --> 00:58:26,425
They took Missandei.

683
00:58:26,508 --> 00:58:28,508
Cersei needs to be destroyed,

684
00:58:28,591 --> 00:58:32,800
but if we attack King's Landing
with Drogon and the Unsullied

685
00:58:32,883 --> 00:58:34,092
and the Dothraki,

686
00:58:34,175 --> 00:58:36,341
tens of thousands
of innocents will die.

687
00:58:36,425 --> 00:58:41,134
That is why Cersei is bringing
them into the Red Keep.

688
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:44,883
These are the people
you came here to protect.

689
00:58:44,967 --> 00:58:46,591
I beg you, Your Grace.

690
00:58:46,675 --> 00:58:50,383
Do not destroy the city
you came to save.

691
00:58:50,466 --> 00:58:54,300
Do not become what you
have always struggled to defeat.

692
00:58:59,134 --> 00:59:02,175
Do you believe we're here
for a reason, Lord Varys?

693
00:59:05,633 --> 00:59:08,717
I'm here to free the world
from tyrants.

694
00:59:09,883 --> 00:59:11,341
That is my destiny...

695
00:59:12,675 --> 00:59:15,633
and I will serve it,
no matter the cost.

696
00:59:22,591 --> 00:59:25,425
It could be a fortnight before
Jon and the allied armies

697
00:59:25,508 --> 00:59:27,508
make it to King's Landing.

698
00:59:27,591 --> 00:59:30,425
In the meantime,
demand Cersei surrender.

699
00:59:30,508 --> 00:59:33,842
Offer her her life
in exchange for the throne.

700
00:59:35,383 --> 00:59:37,883
If there's a chance
to avoid the coming slaughter,

701
00:59:37,967 --> 00:59:40,383
we should make the effort.

702
00:59:40,466 --> 00:59:43,341
Speaking to Cersei
will not prevent a slaughter.

703
00:59:45,591 --> 00:59:47,175
But perhaps it's good the people see

704
00:59:47,259 --> 00:59:51,259
that Daenerys Stormborn made
every effort to avoid bloodshed,

705
00:59:51,341 --> 00:59:53,675
and Cersei Lannister refused.

706
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,800
They should know whom to blame

707
00:59:56,883 --> 00:59:59,009
when the sky falls down upon them.

708
01:00:13,175 --> 01:00:15,758
I've served tyrants most of my life.

709
01:00:16,758 --> 01:00:19,967
They all talk about destiny.

710
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:23,300
She's a girl who walked
into a fire with three stones

711
01:00:23,383 --> 01:00:26,050
and walked out with three dragons.

712
01:00:26,134 --> 01:00:28,883
How could she not believe in destiny?

713
01:00:28,967 --> 01:00:30,842
Perhaps that's the problem.

714
01:00:30,925 --> 01:00:32,134
Her life has convinced her

715
01:00:32,217 --> 01:00:34,092
that she was sent here to save us all.

716
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,092
And how do you know she wasn't?

717
01:00:38,341 --> 01:00:40,259
Then there's the problem of Jon Snow.

718
01:00:46,758 --> 01:00:49,550
Perhaps it's actually a solution.

719
01:00:51,092 --> 01:00:52,508
You know them both.

720
01:00:52,591 --> 01:00:55,717
Tell me, who do you think
would make a better ruler?

721
01:01:01,009 --> 01:01:02,758
He doesn't want the throne.

722
01:01:02,842 --> 01:01:05,300
That's why he bent the knee.

723
01:01:05,383 --> 01:01:07,466
Have you considered the best ruler

724
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:09,967
might be someone
who doesn't want to rule?

725
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:12,341
We're discussing treason.

726
01:01:12,425 --> 01:01:15,092
Don't pretend
you haven't thought about it.

727
01:01:15,175 --> 01:01:18,508
Of course I've thought about it.
Thoughts aren't treason.

728
01:01:20,591 --> 01:01:24,633
He's temperate and measured.
He's a man,

729
01:01:24,717 --> 01:01:27,466
which makes him more appealing
to the lords of Westeros,

730
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,800
whose support we are going to need.

731
01:01:29,883 --> 01:01:31,300
Joffrey was a man.

732
01:01:31,383 --> 01:01:33,633
I don't think a cock
is a true qualification,

733
01:01:33,717 --> 01:01:34,842
as I'm sure you'd agree.

734
01:01:34,925 --> 01:01:36,883
And he's the heir to the throne.

735
01:01:36,967 --> 01:01:40,967
Yes, because he's a man.
Cocks are important, I'm afraid.

736
01:01:43,842 --> 01:01:46,883
What about my earlier proposal?

737
01:01:46,967 --> 01:01:49,175
They could rule together
as king and queen.

738
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,134
She's too strong for him.

739
01:01:53,217 --> 01:01:56,758
She'd bend him to her will,
as she already has.

740
01:01:56,842 --> 01:01:59,925
He could temper her worst impulses.

741
01:02:00,009 --> 01:02:01,967
As you have?

742
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:07,217
You're drinking quite a lot.

743
01:02:09,633 --> 01:02:13,259
A Targaryen father and a Stark mother.

744
01:02:13,341 --> 01:02:16,259
Jon's the one man alive
who might actually be able

745
01:02:16,341 --> 01:02:18,217
to keep the North
in the Seven Kingdoms.

746
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,883
How many kings and queens
have you served?

747
01:02:19,967 --> 01:02:21,341
Five? Six? I've lost count.

748
01:02:21,425 --> 01:02:23,217
- You've always known my reasons.
- At a certain point,

749
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:24,925
you choose a person you believe in,

750
01:02:25,009 --> 01:02:26,508
and you fight for that person.

751
01:02:26,591 --> 01:02:28,675
Even if you know it's a mistake?

752
01:02:30,508 --> 01:02:32,217
I believe in our queen.

753
01:02:34,758 --> 01:02:36,967
She'll make the right choice.

754
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,425
With the help of her loyal advisors.

755
01:02:45,175 --> 01:02:47,550
You know where my loyalty stands.

756
01:02:47,633 --> 01:02:49,925
You know I will never betray the realm.

757
01:02:50,009 --> 01:02:51,300
What is the realm?

758
01:02:51,383 --> 01:02:53,508
A vast continent,
home to millions of people,

759
01:02:53,591 --> 01:02:55,550
most of whom don't care
who sits on the Iron Throne.

760
01:02:55,633 --> 01:02:57,591
Millions of people,
many of whom will die

761
01:02:57,675 --> 01:03:00,341
if the wrong person
sits on that throne.

762
01:03:00,425 --> 01:03:01,633
We don't know their names,

763
01:03:01,717 --> 01:03:03,591
but they're just as real as you and I.

764
01:03:03,675 --> 01:03:04,883
They deserve to live.

765
01:03:04,967 --> 01:03:06,883
They deserve food for their children.

766
01:03:10,633 --> 01:03:14,925
I will act in their interest,
no matter the personal cost.

767
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:19,717
So, what happens to her?

768
01:03:27,675 --> 01:03:28,883
Please.

769
01:03:31,175 --> 01:03:32,259
Don't.

770
01:03:36,925 --> 01:03:39,425
I've spoken as honestly as I can.

771
01:03:40,925 --> 01:03:43,633
Each of us has a choice to make.

772
01:03:44,675 --> 01:03:47,633
I pray we choose wisely.

773
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:00,383
I'm just about to start it.

774
01:04:00,466 --> 01:04:01,883
Good luck.

775
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:03,883
Protect shell right up to the wall.

776
01:04:03,967 --> 01:04:05,550
All right, I'll put another one on it.

777
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:07,466
He's headed down to the cellar.

778
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:09,591
I'll need a cart over here.

779
01:04:09,675 --> 01:04:10,883
That's it, thanks.

780
01:04:10,967 --> 01:04:12,550
Thank you.

781
01:04:12,633 --> 01:04:13,967
It's really heavy, mind you.

782
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,300
We need some more water.

783
01:04:15,383 --> 01:04:16,967
Take it down there!

784
01:04:21,883 --> 01:04:24,300
...as are the rest
of her advisors.

785
01:04:26,633 --> 01:04:27,675
What happened?

786
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:37,675
Euron Greyjoy ambushed
Queen Daenerys and her fleet.

787
01:04:37,758 --> 01:04:40,717
One of the dragons was killed,
several ships destroyed,

788
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,967
Missandei captured.

789
01:04:44,842 --> 01:04:49,009
I always wanted to be there
when they execute your sister.

790
01:04:49,092 --> 01:04:51,800
Seems like I won't get the chance.

791
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:01,175
They're going to destroy that city.

792
01:06:02,217 --> 01:06:03,717
You know they will.

793
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,092
Have you ever run away from a fight?

794
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:10,466
You're not like your sister.
You're not.

795
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:12,675
You're better than she is.

796
01:06:12,758 --> 01:06:15,300
You're a good man
and you can't save her.

797
01:06:15,383 --> 01:06:17,300
You don't need to die with her.

798
01:06:17,383 --> 01:06:18,925
Stay here.

799
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,134
Stay with me.

800
01:06:23,842 --> 01:06:25,800
Please.

801
01:06:26,883 --> 01:06:27,883
Stay.

802
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:36,383
You think I'm a good man?

803
01:06:41,134 --> 01:06:43,842
I pushed a boy out a tower window,

804
01:06:43,925 --> 01:06:46,009
crippled him for life

805
01:06:46,092 --> 01:06:47,092
for Cersei.

806
01:06:50,175 --> 01:06:53,134
I strangled my cousin with my own hands

807
01:06:54,134 --> 01:06:56,259
just to get back to Cersei.

808
01:06:59,259 --> 01:07:00,591
I would have murdered

809
01:07:00,675 --> 01:07:04,883
every man, woman and child in Riverrun

810
01:07:04,967 --> 01:07:06,092
for Cersei.

811
01:07:14,967 --> 01:07:16,800
She's hateful.

812
01:07:18,675 --> 01:07:19,925
And so am I.

813
01:09:55,009 --> 01:09:55,967
My lord.

814
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:02,341
Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's
unconditional surrender

815
01:10:02,425 --> 01:10:05,134
and the immediate release
of Missandei of Naath.

816
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:11,217
Queen Cersei demands Daenerys's
unconditional surrender.

817
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:15,341
If she refuses, Missandei
of Naath will die here and now.

818
01:10:17,009 --> 01:10:18,009
Qyburn...

819
01:10:19,466 --> 01:10:21,259
you're a rational man.

820
01:10:21,341 --> 01:10:24,300
Or so I flatter myself, my lord.

821
01:10:24,383 --> 01:10:25,842
We have a chance here,

822
01:10:27,092 --> 01:10:30,591
perhaps our last chance,
to avoid carnage.

823
01:10:30,675 --> 01:10:31,675
Yes.

824
01:10:33,425 --> 01:10:34,383
Help me.

825
01:10:35,591 --> 01:10:38,466
I don't want to see this city burn.

826
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:41,842
I don't want to hear the screams
of children burning alive.

827
01:10:43,842 --> 01:10:46,800
No, it is not a pleasant sound.

828
01:10:49,009 --> 01:10:51,175
I-- I don't want to hear it.

829
01:10:52,175 --> 01:10:53,675
Help me save this city.

830
01:10:55,633 --> 01:10:58,300
My lord, I am only a mouthpiece
for our queen.

831
01:10:58,383 --> 01:11:00,092
Your queen.

832
01:11:00,175 --> 01:11:02,300
Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

833
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:03,508
You are her subject.

834
01:11:03,591 --> 01:11:05,633
Her reign is over.

835
01:11:05,717 --> 01:11:08,259
You understand this.
Help her understand it.

836
01:11:08,341 --> 01:11:10,883
We understand nothing of the sort.

837
01:11:12,217 --> 01:11:14,758
Your queen's last dragon is vulnerable.

838
01:11:14,842 --> 01:11:17,758
Your armies
are battle-weary and depleted,

839
01:11:17,842 --> 01:11:21,134
while ours have been reinforced
with the Golden Compan--

840
01:11:39,009 --> 01:11:41,175
Ready!

841
01:11:41,259 --> 01:11:42,300
Nock!

842
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:46,383
Draw!

843
01:12:52,675 --> 01:12:55,508
I know you don't care
about your people.

844
01:12:57,466 --> 01:12:59,259
Why should you?

845
01:13:00,758 --> 01:13:04,341
They hate you and you hate them.

846
01:13:09,842 --> 01:13:12,300
But you're not a monster.

847
01:13:14,341 --> 01:13:15,550
I know this.

848
01:13:17,675 --> 01:13:20,508
I know this because I've seen it.

849
01:13:24,383 --> 01:13:26,842
You've always loved your children.

850
01:13:28,842 --> 01:13:30,341
More than yourself,

851
01:13:31,341 --> 01:13:32,800
more than Jaime...

852
01:13:35,591 --> 01:13:37,050
more than anything.

853
01:13:40,009 --> 01:13:41,675
I beg you.

854
01:13:43,883 --> 01:13:47,341
If not for yourself,
then for your child.

855
01:13:50,883 --> 01:13:53,425
Your reign is over,

856
01:13:53,508 --> 01:13:56,508
but that doesn't mean
your life has to end.

857
01:13:59,383 --> 01:14:02,259
It doesn't mean your baby has to die.

858
01:14:50,092 --> 01:14:53,758
If you have any last words,
now is the time.

859
01:15:18,508 --> 01:15:19,800
Dracarys.

860
01:15:29,009 --> 01:15:30,633
No.
