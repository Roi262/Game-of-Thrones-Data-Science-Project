1
00:00:02,555 --> 00:00:04,268
Did you kill Joffrey?

2
00:00:04,798 --> 00:00:07,352
It was something my new friends
wanted very badly.

3
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:10,374
You didn't think I'd let you marry
that beast, did you?

4
00:00:10,494 --> 00:00:13,645
We engaged in intimate relations.

5
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:16,186
Queen Margaery walked in on us.

6
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:19,075
There is enough evidence
to bring a formal trial

7
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:21,716
for Ser Loras and Queen Margaery.
Take her.

8
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:25,010
- Lancel Lannister.
- Brother Lannister.

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,954
- We abandon our family names.
- Quite a family to abandon.

10
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:31,552
To forge a lasting bond with the people,

11
00:00:31,672 --> 00:00:33,639
I will marry the leader
of an ancient family

12
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,337
and reopen the fighting pits.

13
00:00:36,374 --> 00:00:37,620
It's a slave ship.

14
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:41,377
Take me to Slaver's Bay,
put a sword in my hand,

15
00:00:41,497 --> 00:00:43,134
I will prove my worth.

16
00:00:43,254 --> 00:00:45,010
I want you to be my wife.

17
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,190
We have to go, Myrcella. Now.

18
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:52,682
Drop your weapons.

19
00:00:56,134 --> 00:00:57,567
We're going to have a baby.

20
00:00:57,687 --> 00:01:00,196
From the way she's carrying,
it looks like a boy.

21
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:02,797
Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.

22
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:05,252
Sansa is in danger,
even if she doesn't realize it.

23
00:01:05,372 --> 00:01:06,685
If you're ever in trouble,

24
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:10,311
light a candle in the highest window
of the Broken Tower.

25
00:01:12,186 --> 00:01:13,420
Will you take this man?

26
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:15,302
I take this man.

27
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:17,719
You've known Sansa since she was a girl.

28
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:19,351
Now watch her become a woman.

29
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,579
I shall take back the North
from the thieves who stole it.

30
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:27,308
I shall mount Roose Bolton's head
on a spike.

31
00:01:27,428 --> 00:01:29,750
- The Queen and the Princess?
- They're coming with us.

32
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,545
We march at sunrise.

33
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:33,181
And if you go north of the Wall,

34
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,733
gather the remaining free folk
wherever they are and bring them here.

35
00:01:36,853 --> 00:01:38,726
I'll open the gates and let them through.

36
00:01:38,846 --> 00:01:41,057
Make peace to save your people.

37
00:01:41,177 --> 00:01:42,537
You're coming with me.

38
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:34,510
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

39
00:04:43,771 --> 00:04:45,905
First Ranger, you have
command of Castle Black.

40
00:04:46,273 --> 00:04:48,522
Lord Commander,
it is my duty to tell you

41
00:04:48,642 --> 00:04:51,745
I believe this mission
to be reckless, foolhardy,

42
00:04:52,046 --> 00:04:53,747
and an insult
to all the brothers

43
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:56,750
who have died
fighting the wildlings.

44
00:04:57,051 --> 00:04:59,818
As always, thank you
for your honesty.

45
00:05:06,693 --> 00:05:08,060
Safe travels, Lord Commander.

46
00:05:08,295 --> 00:05:10,529
Thank you, Sam.

47
00:05:10,697 --> 00:05:12,365
Oh, um...

48
00:05:18,037 --> 00:05:19,437
It's dragonglass.

49
00:05:19,806 --> 00:05:21,573
It's what I used
to kill the white walker.

50
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,981
I hope you don't need them.

51
00:05:29,182 --> 00:05:31,215
Me, too.

52
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:47,598
Yah.

53
00:06:04,549 --> 00:06:06,249
There he is.

54
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:12,489
That laugh.

55
00:06:12,691 --> 00:06:14,792
<i>Egg.</i>

56
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:17,227
<i>Egg laughed like that.</i>

57
00:06:17,562 --> 00:06:20,596
<i>One of the first things</i>
<i>I remember.</i>

58
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:27,637
His little brother Aegon.
He became king.

59
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:33,576
And before that,
he was a jolly fellow,

60
00:06:33,777 --> 00:06:35,478
like this one.

61
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,119
Get him south, Gillyflower.

62
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:47,990
Before it's too late.

63
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:40,341
Theon, wait.

64
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:42,676
Not Theon, my lady.
Reek.

65
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:44,612
Help me.

66
00:07:46,114 --> 00:07:48,482
You're his wife now.

67
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,684
Theon.

68
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:52,119
Do what he says.

69
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:53,708
Do what he says
or he'll hurt you.

70
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,457
He already hurts me every night.

71
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:57,965
All day I'm locked in this room

72
00:07:58,226 --> 00:08:00,026
and every night he comes...

73
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,163
It can't be any worse.

74
00:08:04,465 --> 00:08:08,034
It can.
It can always be worse.

75
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,831
- What did he do to you?
- Please.

76
00:08:19,046 --> 00:08:21,580
- You betrayed my family!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

77
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:23,983
You have to help me.
Theon, help me.

78
00:08:24,318 --> 00:08:27,453
He'll see us.
You don't know him.

79
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:28,988
My family still has
friends in the North.

80
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:32,291
All I need to do is give a
signal and they'll rescue me.

81
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:34,793
Climb to the top
of the broken tower.

82
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:36,841
Light this candle
and put it in the window.

83
00:08:37,163 --> 00:08:39,397
- Promise me, Theon.
- Reek! My name is Reek.

84
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:45,170
Your name is Theon Greyjoy.

85
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:48,674
Last surviving son
of Balon Greyjoy,

86
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:50,075
Lord of the Iron Islands.

87
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:51,676
Do you hear me?

88
00:08:54,947 --> 00:08:56,514
Theon...

89
00:08:58,117 --> 00:08:59,451
promise me.

90
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,813
Yes, Reek?

91
00:10:20,597 --> 00:10:22,631
<i>Egg.</i>

92
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:25,034
Egg.

93
00:10:27,303 --> 00:10:29,604
Mother's looking for you.

94
00:10:31,107 --> 00:10:33,041
Egg.

95
00:10:34,977 --> 00:10:37,612
Get some sleep, Sam.

96
00:10:37,947 --> 00:10:39,981
You'll have to speak
for him tomorrow.

97
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:43,085
You don't know that.

98
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:45,653
Get some sleep.

99
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:48,322
I'll watch over him.

100
00:10:50,793 --> 00:10:53,160
I'm staying, too.

101
00:10:53,462 --> 00:10:55,162
He's always been good to me.

102
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:57,164
I can't leave him now.

103
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,468
Egg!

104
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,714
Egg.

105
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,384
I dreamed...

106
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:19,586
that I was old.

107
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:33,233
<i>His name</i>
<i>was Aemon Targaryen.</i>

108
00:11:34,768 --> 00:11:36,503
<i>He came to us</i>
<i>from King's Landing.</i>

109
00:11:39,106 --> 00:11:42,008
<i>A maester of the Citadel,</i>
<i>chained and sworn,</i>

110
00:11:42,443 --> 00:11:45,411
<i>and sworn brother of the
Night's Watch, ever faithful.</i>

111
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:48,681
<i>No man was wiser</i>

112
00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:51,951
<i>or gentler or kinder.</i>

113
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:56,522
At the Wall,
a dozen lord commanders

114
00:11:56,857 --> 00:11:58,958
came and went during
his years of service,

115
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:01,293
but he was always there
to counsel them.

116
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,298
He was the blood
of the dragon...

117
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:10,702
but now his fire has gone out.

118
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,006
And now his watch is ended.

119
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:17,709
And now his watch is ended.

120
00:12:46,438 --> 00:12:48,739
You're losing
all your friends, Tarly.

121
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,944
My beautiful wife.

122
00:13:34,118 --> 00:13:35,679
When my father told me
we were marrying,

123
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:38,855
I half expected
a fat, bearded beast.

124
00:13:43,794 --> 00:13:46,462
Do you know how pleased
I was when I saw you?

125
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,897
You've made me very happy.

126
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:56,872
Our scouts report that Stannis
Baratheon rides for Winterfell.

127
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,642
He's a respected commander.

128
00:13:59,976 --> 00:14:03,145
His troops are loyal
and battle-tested.

129
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:07,215
He's hired thousands of foreign
sellswords to bolster his army.

130
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,385
But this storm is a stroke
of luck for us northerners.

131
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:15,190
Our people are used
to fighting in the frost.

132
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:20,194
His army is out there now
suffering in the snow.

133
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,398
One day I'll be
Lord of Winterfell

134
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,667
and Warden of the North.

135
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:28,035
You'll be my lady and Wardeness.

136
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:33,341
But isn't
your stepmother pregnant?

137
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:36,310
What of it?

138
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:38,279
What happens if she has a boy?

139
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:41,548
Then I'll have a baby brother.

140
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:43,150
But he'll be the heir.

141
00:14:43,418 --> 00:14:45,419
I'm Lord Bolton's eldest son.

142
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:46,954
But you're a bastard.

143
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:49,957
A trueborn will always
have the stronger claim.

144
00:14:53,194 --> 00:14:55,529
I've been naturalized
by a royal decree from--

145
00:14:55,797 --> 00:14:58,765
Tommen Baratheon?
Another bastard.

146
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:08,675
Bastards can rise
high in the world.

147
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:11,744
Like your half-brother
Jon Snow.

148
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,715
Born the bastard of Winterfell,

149
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,718
now the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

150
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,922
You didn't know?

151
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:26,091
Yes, he's done
very well for himself.

152
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,860
Oh.

153
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,463
I nearly forgot why
I asked you to join me.

154
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:32,097
Come, my lady.

155
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,344
<i>Your northern friend.</i>

156
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,049
Reek told me
you wanted to leave.

157
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,617
Why?

158
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:54,253
Winterfell is your home

159
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,855
and I am your husband.

160
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,757
Tough old bird.

161
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,192
Everyone talks
when I start peeling them.

162
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,595
But this one,

163
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:06,431
her heart gave out before
I even got to her face.

164
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,836
We do breed them tough
in the North.

165
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,577
Bring my wife
back to her chamber.

166
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,980
It's far too cold
out here for a lady.

167
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,050
You should hold on
to your candles.

168
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,153
The nights are so long now.

169
00:17:19,102 --> 00:17:21,370
<i>40 horses
died in the night.</i>

170
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:24,206
We'll lose more come sunset.

171
00:17:24,507 --> 00:17:25,774
We're running out of food.

172
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:28,543
We can't open the supply
line until the snow clears.

173
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:34,816
What else?

174
00:17:35,118 --> 00:17:38,086
The Stormcrows
rode off last night.

175
00:17:41,457 --> 00:17:43,024
500 men.

176
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:48,296
Sellswords.

177
00:17:48,564 --> 00:17:50,732
Loyal to nothing but gold.

178
00:17:54,703 --> 00:17:56,971
We still have a hard
march to Winterfell

179
00:17:57,373 --> 00:17:58,406
and we won't be marching
anywhere in this weather.

180
00:17:58,573 --> 00:18:00,208
And?

181
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:01,775
This isn't our time.

182
00:18:02,211 --> 00:18:05,346
We should head back to Castle
Black when the snow clears.

183
00:18:05,714 --> 00:18:07,882
I retreated from
King's Landing, Ser Davos.

184
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,351
If I retreat again,
I'll become the King Who Ran.

185
00:18:11,653 --> 00:18:13,453
- Your Grace--
- Winter is coming.

186
00:18:13,822 --> 00:18:16,490
Those aren't just the Stark words.
It's a fact.

187
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,493
If we march
back to Castle Black,

188
00:18:19,761 --> 00:18:21,795
we winter at Castle Black.

189
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:23,797
And who can say how many years

190
00:18:24,065 --> 00:18:25,566
this winter will last?

191
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:27,700
It's better to wait for the right
time than risk everything.

192
00:18:28,069 --> 00:18:30,029
This is the right time
and I will risk everything.

193
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,306
Because if I don't, we've lost.

194
00:18:33,508 --> 00:18:35,442
We march to victory

195
00:18:35,676 --> 00:18:39,346
or we march to defeat.

196
00:18:39,647 --> 00:18:41,948
But we go forward.
Only forward.

197
00:18:51,926 --> 00:18:53,626
Your Grace.

198
00:18:58,465 --> 00:19:00,699
I've trusted in your visions

199
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,835
and your prophecies for years.

200
00:19:04,104 --> 00:19:06,605
You saw it yourself, my king,

201
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:08,541
when you stared into the flames.

202
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:09,975
<i>A great battle in the snow.</i>

203
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,211
- I don't know what I saw.
- <i>You do know.</i>

204
00:19:12,446 --> 00:19:13,446
Trust yourself.

205
00:19:13,713 --> 00:19:15,614
And you?
Do you trust yourself?

206
00:19:15,848 --> 00:19:18,116
I trust in the Lord.

207
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,888
Are you sure?

208
00:19:28,661 --> 00:19:31,897
I have seen myself walk along
the battlements of Winterfell.

209
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:36,901
I have seen the flayed man
banners lowered to the ground.

210
00:19:45,711 --> 00:19:49,147
But sometimes sacrifices must
be made to ensure victory.

211
00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:54,585
I have shown you
the power of king's blood.

212
00:19:54,853 --> 00:19:55,920
The usurper Robb Stark.

213
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:58,322
The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

214
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:00,725
We don't have
Robert's bastard here.

215
00:20:01,026 --> 00:20:04,361
No, we have someone better.

216
00:20:06,197 --> 00:20:08,232
And your blood
runs through her veins.

217
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:11,835
Have you lost your mind?

218
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:13,470
Do you doubt me?

219
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,006
Still?

220
00:20:16,274 --> 00:20:17,841
After all that you've seen.

221
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:19,576
There must be another way.

222
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:22,179
- Leeches or--
- There is only one way.

223
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:26,149
You must become king
before the Long Night begins.

224
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,318
Only you can lead
the living against the dead.

225
00:20:28,585 --> 00:20:31,721
All your life has led us
to this moment.

226
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:34,124
- To this decision.
- She's my daughter.

227
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,594
Get out.

228
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,284
There's always
some sort of grub on.

229
00:21:02,585 --> 00:21:04,486
A bit of mutton would be nice.

230
00:21:08,158 --> 00:21:12,027
A beauty from beyond the Wall.

231
00:21:12,461 --> 00:21:14,981
Where you going, love? Aren't we
better-looking than the fat man?

232
00:21:14,997 --> 00:21:17,765
No, the question is is she pretty
down south in the real world

233
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:20,053
or is she pretty 'cause
she's the only girl here?

234
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:21,736
Even in White Harbor,
I'd want a kiss.

235
00:21:22,004 --> 00:21:24,772
Come on, love, give us a kiss.

236
00:21:25,274 --> 00:21:27,676
- Leave me alone. - Oh, if you were my girl,
I wouldn't leave you alone.

237
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,210
- One little kiss.
- Come on, give him a kiss.

238
00:21:29,511 --> 00:21:31,579
A man gets lonely
guarding the Wall.

239
00:21:36,284 --> 00:21:37,484
There's no need to be rude.

240
00:21:37,785 --> 00:21:39,553
We just want a little affection.

241
00:21:39,787 --> 00:21:42,256
Ooh.

242
00:21:43,758 --> 00:21:45,559
Get your hands off her.

243
00:21:45,827 --> 00:21:48,294
Brother Derek, Brother Brant,

244
00:21:48,629 --> 00:21:50,463
I believe you both
have guard duty tonight.

245
00:21:50,664 --> 00:21:52,065
Sam the Slayer.

246
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:53,687
You gonna slay me
with that sword?

247
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:55,102
<i>Look at his hand shake.</i>

248
00:21:55,302 --> 00:21:57,137
Gilly, go on.

249
00:21:57,471 --> 00:21:59,372
Get back to your room,
lock the door.

250
00:22:02,876 --> 00:22:04,477
- I'm warning you.
- Come on.

251
00:22:04,645 --> 00:22:06,312
Come on.

252
00:22:09,983 --> 00:22:11,551
Sam!

253
00:22:11,818 --> 00:22:14,120
You lying sack of shit.

254
00:22:14,455 --> 00:22:15,921
<i>Killed a white walker, eh?</i>

255
00:22:16,223 --> 00:22:18,424
You fat-ass fuck.

256
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:20,125
Come on, get up.

257
00:22:20,493 --> 00:22:22,861
<i>- No!</i>
<i>- This your hero? This hog?</i>

258
00:22:23,062 --> 00:22:25,964
Leave him alone!

259
00:22:26,332 --> 00:22:28,500
Stubborn little wildling
bitch, aren't you?

260
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,704
- Come on!
- No!

261
00:22:32,972 --> 00:22:35,741
- Sam! Sam! Sam!
- Come on!

262
00:22:44,884 --> 00:22:46,985
- Sam! Sam!
- Come on.

263
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,853
<i>- Right.</i>

264
00:22:49,221 --> 00:22:51,489
<i>I'll deal with this.</i>

265
00:22:53,425 --> 00:22:55,326
<i>- Turn her over.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

266
00:22:57,396 --> 00:23:00,598
I said get your hands off her.

267
00:23:00,932 --> 00:23:02,493
You're gonna
get yourself killed.

268
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:04,635
Your lover Jon Snow's
not here to save you.

269
00:23:05,003 --> 00:23:07,371
I killed a white walker,
I killed a Thenn.

270
00:23:07,673 --> 00:23:10,240
I'll take my chances with you.

271
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,457
<i>Sam!</i>

272
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,328
- I'm all right.
- You're not.

273
00:23:32,562 --> 00:23:34,931
Just a bit woozy.

274
00:23:59,822 --> 00:24:02,262
The next time you see something
like that, you leave it alone.

275
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:05,293
<i>I will not.</i>
<i>They would have--</i>

276
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,465
I don't know what
they would have done.

277
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:13,001
I know they would have killed
you if Ghost hadn't come.

278
00:24:13,302 --> 00:24:16,136
No. No, no.
They were tiring out.

279
00:24:16,437 --> 00:24:18,939
I had them
in the palm of my hand.

280
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:22,209
Don't be stupid, Sam.

281
00:24:22,443 --> 00:24:25,112
You're not a fighter.

282
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:26,646
What kind of man would I be

283
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:29,283
if I ran away when I saw
someone hurting you?

284
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:31,952
Just promise me

285
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,755
whatever happens, you'll
take care of Little Sam.

286
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:36,723
But of course I will.

287
00:24:36,924 --> 00:24:39,125
And...

288
00:24:39,427 --> 00:24:41,628
I'll take care of you, too.

289
00:24:48,168 --> 00:24:49,769
I need more water.

290
00:24:53,607 --> 00:24:55,775
Stay.

291
00:24:55,976 --> 00:24:57,676
<i>Please?</i>

292
00:25:58,002 --> 00:25:59,436
Am I hurting you?

293
00:26:03,374 --> 00:26:04,775
Are you sure?

294
00:26:34,237 --> 00:26:36,639
Oh, my!

295
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,670
<i>A rare find for the
fighting pits, my friends.</i>

296
00:26:56,893 --> 00:27:00,729
Not your usual street tough
or drunken pirate.

297
00:27:00,997 --> 00:27:04,132
This one's a Westerosi knight

298
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,436
from an ancient house
trained in sword and lance.

299
00:27:08,738 --> 00:27:11,006
He fought beside
the stag king Robert

300
00:27:11,306 --> 00:27:12,841
on the far side
of the Narrow Sea.

301
00:27:13,275 --> 00:27:16,110
He was first through the breach
during the Siege of Spike,

302
00:27:16,445 --> 00:27:19,580
slaughtering 50 men
with his flaming sword.

303
00:27:19,948 --> 00:27:23,717
He killed the great Khal
Drogo in single combat.

304
00:27:23,952 --> 00:27:26,087
Betrayed by his woman,

305
00:27:26,455 --> 00:27:29,690
he sold himself into slavery
to repay his debts.

306
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:33,627
<i>Bidding begins at 12 gold honors.</i>

307
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:37,097
13.
Do I have 14?

308
00:27:37,331 --> 00:27:41,068
15?
15 gold honors.

309
00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:44,438
Do I hear 16?
16?

310
00:27:44,606 --> 00:27:46,306
20.

311
00:27:46,474 --> 00:27:47,775
Sold.

312
00:27:57,485 --> 00:28:00,120
Wait! You have
to buy me as well.

313
00:28:00,288 --> 00:28:01,688
Why?

314
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,224
We're a team.

315
00:28:04,492 --> 00:28:05,959
I'm a great fighter, too.

316
00:28:09,463 --> 00:28:11,998
He's funny.
You have to give him that.

317
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,760
You're right, he's funny.

318
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:50,602
Thank you, my lord.
Thank you.

319
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,970
Yes.

320
00:28:52,204 --> 00:28:54,205
My lord, if I may.

321
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,441
I've heard Meereen
has become a free city.

322
00:28:56,909 --> 00:28:59,829
You might run into trouble if you try
to fight slaves in the fighting pits.

323
00:28:59,845 --> 00:29:02,126
Now, if you were to fight freed
men who'd be paid a wage--

324
00:29:05,384 --> 00:29:07,152
There's your wages, funny man.

325
00:29:07,453 --> 00:29:09,787
Should last the rest
of your life.

326
00:29:11,457 --> 00:29:14,258
These are warrior
hands, not a serving girl's.

327
00:29:14,459 --> 00:29:16,060
5, going once...

328
00:29:20,532 --> 00:29:23,534
How long before the King of
Meereen comes to claim my pillow?

329
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:25,335
Don't be ridiculous.

330
00:29:25,637 --> 00:29:29,406
My marriage to Hizdahr
is political.

331
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,775
I think he's smart enough
to understand that.

332
00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:35,838
I think the Sons of the
Harpy have stopped killing

333
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,814
because their leader
was made king.

334
00:29:40,818 --> 00:29:43,019
Are you jealous?

335
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:45,656
You think I'm petty enough
to speak ill of a man

336
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,991
just because he
represents competition?

337
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,026
I do.

338
00:29:51,829 --> 00:29:53,396
You're right.

339
00:29:53,664 --> 00:29:56,465
My motivations
are entirely impure.

340
00:30:05,342 --> 00:30:06,975
Doesn't make me wrong.

341
00:30:11,781 --> 00:30:15,551
You told me yourself I can't fight
enemies within and without.

342
00:30:15,852 --> 00:30:18,087
So when enemies without
come knocking,

343
00:30:18,422 --> 00:30:20,155
I need the city
of Meereen behind me.

344
00:30:20,356 --> 00:30:22,791
I have no choice.

345
00:30:23,026 --> 00:30:24,392
Everyone has a choice.

346
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,061
Even slaves
have a choice--

347
00:30:26,295 --> 00:30:27,896
death or slavery.

348
00:30:28,164 --> 00:30:30,799
So what else can I do, hmm?

349
00:30:32,802 --> 00:30:34,803
Marry me instead.

350
00:30:36,372 --> 00:30:40,675
Even if I wanted to do
such an inadvisable thing,

351
00:30:40,876 --> 00:30:42,244
I couldn't.

352
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:44,045
Why not?

353
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,047
You are queen.
You can do what you like.

354
00:30:48,484 --> 00:30:51,919
No, I can't.

355
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,722
Then you are the only person
in Meereen who's not free.

356
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:10,404
And I know I'm here to serve
my queen and not give advice,

357
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:12,706
but can I make
one more suggestion?

358
00:31:16,811 --> 00:31:18,812
Of course.

359
00:31:21,349 --> 00:31:23,884
On the day of the great games,

360
00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:26,753
gather all the Great
Masters and Wise Masters

361
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:29,990
and Worthy Masters you can find

362
00:31:30,258 --> 00:31:31,724
and slaughter them all.

363
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:38,865
I am a queen, not a butcher.

364
00:31:43,837 --> 00:31:46,773
All rulers are either
butchers or meat.

365
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:59,084
You there. Where would
I find the High Septon

366
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,454
or High Sparrow or whatever
bloody fool name he's got?

367
00:32:02,856 --> 00:32:06,292
It's not as good a name as
Queen of Thorns, I'll admit.

368
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:09,661
You should have the decency

369
00:32:09,963 --> 00:32:12,031
to stand when
you speak to a lady.

370
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:14,899
You should have the decency
to kneel before the gods.

371
00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:16,522
Don't spar with me,
little fellow.

372
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:22,541
For me, it's the knees.

373
00:32:22,742 --> 00:32:24,476
- You?
- Hips.

374
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:26,545
Ah.

375
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:30,549
A man of the people.
Is that your game?

376
00:32:30,883 --> 00:32:34,185
It's an old game.
Dull and unconvincing.

377
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,554
A man of the people

378
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:39,224
who does Cersei's
dirty work for her.

379
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:42,327
The people always
do the dirty work.

380
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:45,263
Spare me the homilies. I can
smell a fraud from a mile away.

381
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:46,731
Useful talent.

382
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:49,700
I'm here for my grandson
and granddaughter.

383
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,236
Your grandson and granddaughter

384
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:55,539
swore sacred vows and lied.

385
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,008
The Father judges us all.

386
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:00,378
Sons of high lords,

387
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:02,546
sons of fishermen.

388
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:05,815
If you break his laws,
you will be punished.

389
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,551
Don't you walk away from me.

390
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,587
You don't give commands
here, Lady Olenna.

391
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:12,222
What is it you want?

392
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,324
Gold?

393
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:17,294
I'll make you the richest
septon who ever lived.

394
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:21,163
What, then?

395
00:33:21,465 --> 00:33:24,100
I imagine this
is strange for you.

396
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,736
Everyone you meet
has a hidden motive

397
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:30,106
and you pride yourself
on sniffing it out.

398
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,375
<i>But I'm telling you</i>
<i>a simple truth.</i>

399
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,811
I serve the gods.

400
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:36,746
The gods demand justice.

401
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:39,282
How do they communicate
their demands?

402
00:33:39,516 --> 00:33:41,050
By raven or horse?

403
00:33:41,385 --> 00:33:44,086
By the holy text,
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

404
00:33:44,388 --> 00:33:46,522
If you don't have one
in your library,

405
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,790
<i>I'll give you my own.</i>

406
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:50,359
I've read
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

407
00:33:50,827 --> 00:33:54,763
<i>Then you'll remember the passages
concerning buggery and perjury.</i>

408
00:33:55,064 --> 00:33:57,165
Your grandchildren
will be punished

409
00:33:57,567 --> 00:34:01,770
in the same manner as anyone
who breaks the sacred laws.

410
00:34:02,071 --> 00:34:03,405
Half the men,
women, and children

411
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,909
in this foul city
break the sacred laws.

412
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:10,245
You live among murderers,
thieves, and rapists,

413
00:34:10,512 --> 00:34:12,213
and yet you punish Loras

414
00:34:12,514 --> 00:34:15,783
for shagging some perfumed ponce

415
00:34:16,085 --> 00:34:17,986
and Margaery for defending
her brother?

416
00:34:18,387 --> 00:34:22,424
Yes. The gods' laws must
be applied to all equally.

417
00:34:22,724 --> 00:34:25,160
If it's equality
you want, so be it.

418
00:34:25,561 --> 00:34:29,163
When House Tyrell stops sending
our crops to the capital,

419
00:34:29,397 --> 00:34:31,398
everyone here will starve.

420
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:34,469
And I'll make sure the
hungry know who's to blame.

421
00:34:37,773 --> 00:34:40,441
Have you ever sowed the
field, Lady Olenna?

422
00:34:42,911 --> 00:34:45,712
Have you ever reaped the grain?

423
00:34:46,014 --> 00:34:47,547
Has anyone in House Tyrell?

424
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,717
A lifetime of wealth and power

425
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:52,552
has left you blind in one eye.

426
00:34:54,856 --> 00:34:58,558
You are the few,
we are the many.

427
00:35:00,461 --> 00:35:03,864
And when the many
stop fearing the few...

428
00:35:18,145 --> 00:35:20,713
Lady Olenna.

429
00:35:31,825 --> 00:35:33,505
Starving yourself
won't make things

430
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,928
any better for her, my love.

431
00:35:38,598 --> 00:35:40,399
She's in a prison cell

432
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:43,435
and there is nothing I can do.

433
00:35:46,806 --> 00:35:48,440
I am the king!

434
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:51,776
The queen is in prison and
there is nothing I can do!

435
00:36:06,191 --> 00:36:09,527
No matter who you are,

436
00:36:09,862 --> 00:36:11,763
no matter how strong
you are, sooner or later,

437
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,231
you'll face circumstances
beyond your control.

438
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,301
Events you couldn't
possibly have anticipated

439
00:36:17,603 --> 00:36:19,003
or prevented even if you had.

440
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:22,106
You cannot blame
yourself for fate.

441
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:24,675
Your father,

442
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:26,410
your brother,
your grandfather--

443
00:36:26,811 --> 00:36:29,713
I was Queen of the Seven
Kingdoms and what could I do?

444
00:36:30,014 --> 00:36:32,383
Hold them as they
left this world.

445
00:36:32,684 --> 00:36:34,351
Kissed their heads
after they'd gone.

446
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:36,653
I'll call in the army.

447
00:36:36,888 --> 00:36:38,789
I'll take back the sept

448
00:36:39,057 --> 00:36:42,292
and kill every last one of them.

449
00:36:44,361 --> 00:36:46,630
I'll start a war if I have to.

450
00:36:47,065 --> 00:36:50,233
You know as well as I do who the
first casualty of that war would be.

451
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:57,173
I love her.

452
00:37:00,244 --> 00:37:02,312
I love her...

453
00:37:04,815 --> 00:37:06,216
and I can't help her.

454
00:37:22,332 --> 00:37:23,733
We must be strong
for those we love.

455
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:26,035
We cannot give in to despair.

456
00:37:26,336 --> 00:37:29,104
I will speak
with the High Sparrow.

457
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,672
There must be
something he--

458
00:37:31,007 --> 00:37:33,108
Let me talk to him
on your behalf.

459
00:37:33,576 --> 00:37:36,911
The king cannot sully himself
negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.

460
00:37:38,448 --> 00:37:40,315
You will try to help her?

461
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,752
I'll do everything I can to win
her freedom and her brother's.

462
00:37:44,086 --> 00:37:46,788
Your happiness is all
I want in this world.

463
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,859
- I know.
- No, you don't.

464
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,297
You can't possibly.

465
00:37:58,433 --> 00:38:00,902
Not until you have
children of your own.

466
00:38:01,203 --> 00:38:03,604
I would do anything for you.

467
00:38:05,207 --> 00:38:07,441
Anything to keep you from harm.

468
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:12,112
I would burn cities
to the ground.

469
00:38:13,915 --> 00:38:17,185
You are all that matters.

470
00:38:17,419 --> 00:38:21,155
You and your sister.

471
00:38:21,455 --> 00:38:24,224
From the moment you came
into this world.

472
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:26,727
My boy.

473
00:38:29,164 --> 00:38:31,165
My only boy.

474
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,780
Prince Doran hopes
this satisfies

475
00:38:48,148 --> 00:38:50,517
your concerns about the
princess's well-being.

476
00:38:57,758 --> 00:38:59,525
You looked different
when I left.

477
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,828
You had more hair.

478
00:39:02,029 --> 00:39:04,964
And more hands.

479
00:39:05,298 --> 00:39:07,600
- How's Trystane?
- He'll be all right.

480
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:08,834
I'm sorry for that.

481
00:39:09,135 --> 00:39:10,615
It wasn't supposed
to happen that way.

482
00:39:10,637 --> 00:39:12,170
Why is it happening at all?

483
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,174
Your mother's worried about you.

484
00:39:16,443 --> 00:39:18,611
Threats have been made.

485
00:39:18,878 --> 00:39:20,145
Dorne's too dangerous for you.

486
00:39:20,513 --> 00:39:22,581
- I've come to take you home.
- This is my home.

487
00:39:22,849 --> 00:39:24,249
This has been my home for years.

488
00:39:24,617 --> 00:39:26,551
I didn't want to come here,
but she told me to.

489
00:39:26,786 --> 00:39:27,753
I did what she said.

490
00:39:28,121 --> 00:39:30,387
I did my duty and now
she's forcing me to go back?

491
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:33,523
It's for your own good.
These are complicated matters.

492
00:39:33,892 --> 00:39:35,993
<i>No, it's not complicated at all.
It's simple.</i>

493
00:39:36,327 --> 00:39:38,295
I love Trystane,
I'm going to marry him,

494
00:39:38,563 --> 00:39:39,864
and we're staying right here.

495
00:39:40,198 --> 00:39:41,632
- I don't understand.
- Of course you don't.

496
00:39:41,867 --> 00:39:43,834
You don't know me.

497
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:56,112
<i>♪ Brothers, O brothers,
my days here are done ♪</i>

498
00:39:56,414 --> 00:40:00,950
<i>♪ The Dornishman's</i>

503
00:40:17,935 --> 00:40:20,803
He's got a good voice.

504
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,605
We're lucky he's a singer.

505
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:25,107
If he were a fighter, we
might have been in trouble.

506
00:40:25,409 --> 00:40:28,344
It's against my code
to hurt a woman.

507
00:40:28,745 --> 00:40:31,380
It's amazing how many men we
beat seem to have this code.

508
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:33,115
I wouldn't say you beat me.

509
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,850
How's your arm?

510
00:40:35,051 --> 00:40:36,852
Wonderful.

511
00:40:37,253 --> 00:40:39,922
Wouldn't feel right to leave
Dorne without a new scar.

512
00:40:40,256 --> 00:40:42,057
You think you're leaving Dorne?

513
00:40:42,258 --> 00:40:44,126
No great hurry.

514
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,995
Dornish women are the most
beautiful women in the world.

515
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:48,263
Thank you.

516
00:40:48,597 --> 00:40:51,466
I said Dornish women.
I didn't say you.

517
00:40:54,403 --> 00:40:56,738
I'm not the most beautiful
woman you've ever seen?

518
00:40:58,574 --> 00:40:59,895
<i>I've seen
quite a few women</i>

519
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:01,082
<i>in all the Seven Kingdoms.</i>

520
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,646
Name one more beautiful
than I am.

521
00:41:06,782 --> 00:41:09,851
Well, now, in King's Landing,

522
00:41:10,152 --> 00:41:13,454
<i>there was an absolutely</i>
<i>gorgeous...</i>

523
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:19,126
There was a what?

524
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,598
In King's Landing,
you were saying?

525
00:41:24,766 --> 00:41:26,533
Was I?

526
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,703
There was a woman
more beautiful than I am.

527
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,472
Was there?

528
00:41:31,773 --> 00:41:33,674
My memory's not
what it was earlier.

529
00:41:37,345 --> 00:41:38,712
How's your arm now?

530
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,481
You seem concerned with it.

531
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:42,582
<i>You must really like me.</i>

532
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:54,160
And how about your head?

533
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:00,767
<i>My head?</i>

534
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:03,102
My head?

535
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,938
You don't even want to
know what's going on in--

536
00:42:16,349 --> 00:42:18,317
Your nose is bleeding.

537
00:42:21,521 --> 00:42:23,889
It's nothing.
It's the dry air.

538
00:42:27,227 --> 00:42:31,630
My dagger was coated with a
special ointment from Asshai.

539
00:42:31,964 --> 00:42:34,198
<i>They call it the Long Farewell.</i>

540
00:42:34,467 --> 00:42:36,435
It takes time to work,

541
00:42:36,803 --> 00:42:40,539
but if a single drop
makes contact with the skin,

542
00:42:40,706 --> 00:42:41,573
death.

543
00:42:50,149 --> 00:42:52,250
The only antidote.

544
00:42:57,323 --> 00:42:59,590
Who's the most beautiful
woman in the world?

545
00:43:01,026 --> 00:43:02,260
You.

546
00:43:03,562 --> 00:43:06,029
Sorry? Who?

547
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:10,568
You.

548
00:43:10,769 --> 00:43:12,536
Don't drop it.

549
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:29,186
I think you're
very handsome as well.

550
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,598
- I'm sorry about the locale.
- No, you're not.

551
00:44:19,301 --> 00:44:21,202
It felt like the safest place.

552
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,438
Not for your clientele, clearly.

553
00:44:24,507 --> 00:44:26,742
It was an establishment
like no other.

554
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:30,078
The sheer range
of appetites catered to.

555
00:44:30,346 --> 00:44:31,879
Desires that didn't even exist

556
00:44:32,114 --> 00:44:34,882
until we invented them.

557
00:44:35,317 --> 00:44:38,086
You've always been rather impressed
with yourself, haven't you?

558
00:44:39,488 --> 00:44:42,223
The past is the past.

559
00:44:42,591 --> 00:44:45,693
The future is all
that's worth discussing.

560
00:44:47,362 --> 00:44:48,829
The future of House Tyrell.

561
00:44:49,197 --> 00:44:51,632
Don't pretend to have
any concern for my house,

562
00:44:51,867 --> 00:44:53,434
my grandchildren or me.

563
00:44:53,802 --> 00:44:56,136
I should have known
you'd return to the capital

564
00:44:56,471 --> 00:44:58,405
as soon as things
started to go wrong.

565
00:44:58,807 --> 00:45:00,707
- I promise you--
- I promise you, Lord Baelish,

566
00:45:00,975 --> 00:45:02,842
that our fates are joined.

567
00:45:03,111 --> 00:45:04,678
Together we murdered a king.

568
00:45:05,046 --> 00:45:08,348
If my house should fall,
I will have nothing to hide.

569
00:45:09,717 --> 00:45:12,819
And if I should meet
with some accident

570
00:45:13,154 --> 00:45:16,022
here at your broken
little flesh market,

571
00:45:16,357 --> 00:45:19,425
they'll never even find
what's left of you.

572
00:45:19,627 --> 00:45:22,095
So...

573
00:45:22,362 --> 00:45:24,163
do you deny a part in all this?

574
00:45:24,465 --> 00:45:27,366
Cersei summoned me
to King's Landing.

575
00:45:27,635 --> 00:45:29,002
I dared not refuse her.

576
00:45:29,236 --> 00:45:30,737
And what did she want?

577
00:45:31,072 --> 00:45:33,906
A piece of information
she knew that I had.

578
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:37,543
Neither silence
nor lies were an option.

579
00:45:37,844 --> 00:45:40,179
But I have other information

580
00:45:40,414 --> 00:45:41,814
of which she is unaware.

581
00:45:43,717 --> 00:45:46,185
And as you say,
our interests are aligned.

582
00:45:48,322 --> 00:45:50,055
I have a gift for you.

583
00:45:50,256 --> 00:45:51,690
What kind of gift?

584
00:45:51,992 --> 00:45:55,027
The same kind I gave Cersei.

585
00:45:55,261 --> 00:45:56,929
A handsome young man.

586
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:13,578
<i>Many worthy
fighters have died</i>

587
00:46:13,912 --> 00:46:16,014
<i>trying to make it</i>
<i>to the great games.</i>

588
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:19,184
When most of you worthless scum
join them in death this afternoon,

589
00:46:19,585 --> 00:46:22,454
it will represent a significant
rise in your station.

590
00:46:22,755 --> 00:46:25,389
But if you do happen
to triumph here,

591
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,192
<i>you will fight at the Great
Pit of Daznak itself</i>

592
00:46:28,426 --> 00:46:29,794
<i>in front of the queen.</i>

593
00:46:30,228 --> 00:46:34,165
So whatever happens, the gods
have smiled upon you today.

594
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:38,469
This is the day your lives
actually start to mean something.

595
00:46:40,805 --> 00:46:43,240
You and you.
You.

596
00:46:44,709 --> 00:46:46,544
You two.

597
00:46:48,913 --> 00:46:50,247
<i>You, you, and you.</i>

598
00:46:51,249 --> 00:46:53,184
Up.

599
00:46:53,552 --> 00:46:56,153
- <i>Valar morghulis.</i>
<i>- Valar dohaeris.</i>

600
00:46:56,387 --> 00:46:58,221
Prepare yourselves.

601
00:47:10,501 --> 00:47:13,035
Sitting through the great
games will be bad enough.

602
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:16,072
For generations in the days
leading up to the great games,

603
00:47:16,407 --> 00:47:17,768
it has been customary
for our ruler

604
00:47:17,941 --> 00:47:19,475
to make the rounds
of the lower pits

605
00:47:19,843 --> 00:47:21,977
to pay the fighters there
the honor of her presence.

606
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:28,984
<i>Move yourselves.</i>

607
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:36,658
Your Grace.

608
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,060
Your future Grace.

609
00:47:38,294 --> 00:47:40,495
You honor us all.

610
00:47:42,999 --> 00:47:45,167
Stand there.

611
00:47:45,501 --> 00:47:47,802
Stand straight.
That's the fucking queen.

612
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,440
We fight and
die for your glory,

613
00:47:51,507 --> 00:47:53,375
O glorious queen.

614
00:47:56,212 --> 00:47:58,280
We fight and
die for your glory,

615
00:47:58,514 --> 00:48:00,148
<i>O glorious queen.</i>

616
00:48:01,784 --> 00:48:04,152
<i>Fight!</i>

617
00:49:02,677 --> 00:49:03,710
I think I've seen enough.

618
00:49:04,011 --> 00:49:06,713
Your Grace, it is a tradition

619
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,049
for the queen to stay
until the victor has emerged.

620
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,530
I've sacrificed more than
enough for your traditions.

621
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:18,691
What are you doing?

622
00:49:27,967 --> 00:49:29,301
Wait your turn,
you piece of fucking filth.

623
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:00,789
Get him out of my sight.

624
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:03,058
Khaleesi, please.

625
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,493
I just need
a moment of your time.

626
00:51:05,728 --> 00:51:07,362
I brought you a gift.

627
00:51:08,631 --> 00:51:10,131
<i>It's true.</i>

628
00:51:11,534 --> 00:51:13,968
He has.

629
00:51:14,169 --> 00:51:15,837
Who are you?

630
00:51:17,172 --> 00:51:19,073
I am the gift.

631
00:51:21,209 --> 00:51:23,878
<i>It's a pleasure</i>
<i>to meet you, Your Grace.</i>

632
00:51:25,047 --> 00:51:27,048
My name is Tyrion Lannister.

633
00:52:00,214 --> 00:52:01,948
This is horrible.

634
00:52:02,183 --> 00:52:04,084
Unacceptable.

635
00:52:05,886 --> 00:52:08,088
Are they feeding you
enough at least?

636
00:52:09,457 --> 00:52:12,425
I brought you this.
Venison.

637
00:52:12,626 --> 00:52:14,594
It's quite good.

638
00:52:17,764 --> 00:52:20,533
I had it myself for supper
only last night.

639
00:52:24,771 --> 00:52:27,573
We did everything we could from the
moment they took your brother.

640
00:52:27,908 --> 00:52:29,709
Tommen even went
to the sept himself

641
00:52:29,977 --> 00:52:32,111
to confront the High Sparrow.

642
00:52:32,445 --> 00:52:35,180
But I fear the Faith
has left reason behind.

643
00:52:35,415 --> 00:52:38,250
I know you did this.

644
00:52:38,584 --> 00:52:42,087
We are making every effort
on your behalf.

645
00:52:42,389 --> 00:52:44,623
I swear to you
by all the seven gods.

646
00:52:44,891 --> 00:52:46,758
Lies come easily to you.

647
00:52:46,993 --> 00:52:48,427
Everyone knows that.

648
00:52:48,628 --> 00:52:51,362
<i>But innocence,</i>

649
00:52:51,597 --> 00:52:54,032
<i>decency, concern,</i>

650
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,801
you're not very good
at those, I'm afraid.

651
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:00,539
Perhaps that's why
your son was so eager

652
00:53:00,806 --> 00:53:02,440
to cast you aside for me.

653
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:06,644
You're upset.

654
00:53:06,945 --> 00:53:09,080
You're not thinking clearly.

655
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:11,642
I'll visit again when you've
had a chance to calm down.

656
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:13,384
I don't want to see you again.

657
00:53:13,752 --> 00:53:15,653
I do hope you change
your mind about that.

658
00:53:15,954 --> 00:53:18,356
I've been told men often go mad

659
00:53:18,657 --> 00:53:20,958
in the Black Cells
beneath the Red Keep.

660
00:53:21,293 --> 00:53:22,560
Though I suppose
your isolation will end

661
00:53:22,794 --> 00:53:24,929
when your trial begins.

662
00:53:26,364 --> 00:53:28,198
Leave.

663
00:53:28,366 --> 00:53:30,034
Yes.

664
00:53:30,268 --> 00:53:31,702
I'm afraid I must.

665
00:53:32,037 --> 00:53:33,804
<i>My son needs me now</i>
<i>more than ever.</i>

666
00:53:34,105 --> 00:53:36,440
Get out, you hateful bitch!

667
00:53:50,621 --> 00:53:52,456
Sleep well, sister.

668
00:54:20,217 --> 00:54:21,584
Thank you, Boake.

669
00:54:28,858 --> 00:54:30,358
- You saw her?
- Yes.

670
00:54:30,727 --> 00:54:33,128
- And?
- Her accommodations seem sufficient.

671
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,530
What happens to her now?

672
00:54:35,865 --> 00:54:37,833
Well, she and her brother
are both being held

673
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:39,868
under fair suspicion.

674
00:54:40,169 --> 00:54:42,303
A trial will be held
for each of them

675
00:54:42,605 --> 00:54:45,440
to determine if they're
guilty of any acts

676
00:54:45,874 --> 00:54:49,010
that might constitute a violation
of the tenets of the faith.

677
00:54:49,245 --> 00:54:50,911
Who will stand judge?

678
00:54:51,347 --> 00:54:55,082
Seven septons as it was in all
trials before the Targaryens.

679
00:54:56,718 --> 00:54:57,678
Will you be one of them?

680
00:54:57,853 --> 00:54:59,254
I will.

681
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:03,557
If one or both of them

682
00:55:03,892 --> 00:55:06,127
were to confess
before the trial...

683
00:55:06,461 --> 00:55:08,295
Then they will be shown
the Mother's mercy.

684
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:11,866
And what does
the Mother's mercy entail?

685
00:55:12,134 --> 00:55:14,234
It depends upon the situation.

686
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:17,337
The acts themselves,
the degree of contrition.

687
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:20,307
Thank you, High Septon,

688
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:23,043
for bringing them whatever
justice they deserve

689
00:55:23,311 --> 00:55:25,912
<i>in the eyes of the Seven.</i>

690
00:55:30,084 --> 00:55:31,518
<i>Did you know this chapel</i>

691
00:55:31,919 --> 00:55:34,253
is one of the oldest
structures in King's Landing?

692
00:55:36,057 --> 00:55:38,224
I think I may have
heard at one point.

693
00:55:38,492 --> 00:55:41,094
Baelor built his sept around it.

694
00:55:42,763 --> 00:55:45,732
But men worshipped here
long before him.

695
00:55:45,966 --> 00:55:48,501
Who carved this altar?

696
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:51,837
- Do you know?
- I'm afraid I don't.

697
00:55:52,005 --> 00:55:54,139
No one does.

698
00:55:54,508 --> 00:55:57,943
There's no name on it or
anywhere else in the chapel.

699
00:56:00,146 --> 00:56:02,281
No, the people
who built this place

700
00:56:02,649 --> 00:56:06,519
didn't inflict their vanity
on those who came after them

701
00:56:06,953 --> 00:56:10,355
the way Baelor did with that great
gilded monstrosity up there.

702
00:56:10,523 --> 00:56:12,091
Hmm.

703
00:56:12,325 --> 00:56:14,326
Their faith was clean.

704
00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:18,296
Strip away the gold
and the ornaments,

705
00:56:18,631 --> 00:56:22,034
knock down the statues
and the pillars,

706
00:56:22,301 --> 00:56:24,269
and this is what remains.

707
00:56:27,373 --> 00:56:29,774
Something simple...

708
00:56:33,145 --> 00:56:36,348
and solid and true.

709
00:56:41,053 --> 00:56:44,055
The Tyrells' finery
will be stripped away.

710
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:47,158
<i>Their lies knocked down.</i>

711
00:56:47,525 --> 00:56:50,194
<i>Their true hearts</i>
<i>laid bare for all to see.</i>

712
00:56:51,663 --> 00:56:54,298
And so it will be for all of us.

713
00:56:54,532 --> 00:56:56,900
High and low alike.

714
00:57:01,139 --> 00:57:03,173
What will we find

715
00:57:03,475 --> 00:57:06,209
when we strip away your finery?

716
00:57:09,681 --> 00:57:12,916
A young man came to us
not long ago.

717
00:57:13,184 --> 00:57:15,852
Broken in body and spirit.

718
00:57:18,189 --> 00:57:20,257
He had so much to strip away.

719
00:57:22,326 --> 00:57:25,862
<i>So much weighing him down.</i>

720
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:29,099
<i>But piece by piece,</i>
<i>he unburdened himself.</i>

721
00:57:30,768 --> 00:57:32,635
<i>Let go of vanity,</i>

722
00:57:32,836 --> 00:57:35,171
pride, sin.

723
00:57:37,908 --> 00:57:40,310
Now his soul is so light,

724
00:57:40,711 --> 00:57:43,546
he will float through the
Seven Heavens like a bird.

725
00:57:43,714 --> 00:57:45,181
Hmm.

726
00:57:50,386 --> 00:57:52,822
And he has much
to say about you.

727
00:58:17,112 --> 00:58:18,714
Move.

728
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:23,351
Let me go immediately.

729
00:58:23,652 --> 00:58:26,321
You will order her to let me go.

730
00:58:26,621 --> 00:58:29,023
I am the queen!
I am the queen!

731
00:58:29,258 --> 00:58:30,725
Have you lost your mind?

732
00:58:30,926 --> 00:58:32,460
Let me go!

733
00:58:34,096 --> 00:58:35,996
<i>Get your filthy hands off me!</i>

734
00:58:36,264 --> 00:58:38,566
<i>Have you lost your mind?</i>

735
00:58:38,834 --> 00:58:41,402
<i>I am the queen!</i>
<i>Let me go!</i>

736
00:58:47,676 --> 00:58:49,343
Look at me.

737
00:58:52,013 --> 00:58:53,347
Look at my face.

738
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:59,353
It's the last thing
you'll see before you die.

739
