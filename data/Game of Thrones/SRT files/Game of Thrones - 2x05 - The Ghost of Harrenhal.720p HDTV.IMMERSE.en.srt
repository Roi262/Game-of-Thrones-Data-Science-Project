The wolf pup has gone south.

2
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:04,763
The North is ripe for
the taking.

3
00:00:04,788 --> 00:00:08,201
You'll take a ship to raid the
fishing villages on the Stony Shore

4
00:00:08,202 --> 00:00:10,855
- I'm to fight fishermen?
- Be careful of their nets.

5
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:13,360
- Lovely boy.
- What do you want?

6
00:00:13,394 --> 00:00:14,862
You're called Arry?

7
00:00:14,896 --> 00:00:16,797
<i>A boy could make a friend.</i>

8
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:19,199
This man has the honor
to be Jaqen H'ghar.

9
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:20,967
<i>Every night it's the same.</i>

10
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:23,937
<i>I'm running through</i>
<i>the Godswood howling.</i>

11
00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:25,739
These are dreams,
nothing more.

12
00:00:25,773 --> 00:00:27,942
My dreams are different.
Mine are true.

13
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:31,378
<i>I saw something take that child.</i>

14
00:00:31,413 --> 00:00:34,948
Wildlings serve crueler
Gods than you or I.

15
00:00:34,983 --> 00:00:37,551
Ready my horse.
We leave at dawn.

16
00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:40,175
Did Cersei have you
knighted before or after

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,588
she took you into her bed?

18
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:44,023
- Nothing to say?
- Mercy! Mercy, My Lord!

19
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:47,460
I want to know what Cersei is
doing and you will tell me.

20
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:48,928
Yes, My Lord, I will.

21
00:00:48,962 --> 00:00:50,897
Sweet boy!
Help us!

22
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,000
<i>Round up any survivors.</i>

23
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:56,036
<i>We'll take them</i>
<i>back to Harrenhal.</i>

24
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,739
This one's a girl
dressed as a boy.

25
00:00:58,773 --> 00:01:01,241
Get these prisoners to work.
Bring the girl.

26
00:01:01,276 --> 00:01:03,076
I need a new cupbearer.

27
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:05,479
I will give you this
one night to reconsider.

28
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:06,580
<i>Otherwise I shall</i>
<i>destroy you.</i>

29
00:01:06,615 --> 00:01:08,582
Look to your sins,
Lord Renly.

30
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:10,951
<i>The night is dark</i>
<i>and full of terrors.</i>

31
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:14,421
I will vouch for her,
her people and her dragons.

32
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,925
Be it on your head.

33
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:20,861
Welcome to Qarth, My Lady.

34
00:01:20,895 --> 00:01:22,896
Trust you've not forgotten
your smuggler's tricks.

35
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,432

- <i>The red woman.</i>

- You swear it?

41
00:03:47,836 --> 00:03:51,272
My son has no interest
in the Iron Throne.

42
00:03:56,913 --> 00:03:59,949
Then I see no reason
for hostility between us.

43
00:03:59,983 --> 00:04:02,685
Your son can go on calling
himself King in the North,

44
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,256
the Starks will have dominion over
all lands north of Moat Cailin,

45
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,392
provided he swears me
an oath of fealty.

46
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:09,726
And the wording
of this oath?

47
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:12,529
The same Ned Stark swore
to Robert 18 years ago.

48
00:04:14,665 --> 00:04:18,302
Cat, their friendship held
the kingdoms together.

49
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:25,443
And in return
for my son's loyalty?

50
00:04:25,477 --> 00:04:28,613
In the morning I'll destroy
my brother's army.

51
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:30,114
When that's done,

52
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:32,550
Baratheon and Stark
will fight

53
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:34,419
their common enemy
together,

54
00:04:34,453 --> 00:04:36,721
as they have done
many times before.

55
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:46,199
Our two houses
have always been close,

56
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:50,036
which is why I am begging you
to reconsider this battle.

57
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,670
Negotiate a peace
with your brother.

58
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:54,439
Negotiate with Stannis?

59
00:04:54,473 --> 00:04:56,241
You heard him out there.

60
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:59,244
I'd have better luck
debating the wind.

61
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:03,781
Please bring my terms
to your son.

62
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:06,116
I believe we are
natural allies.

63
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:07,785
I hope he feels
the same.

64
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:10,688
Together we could end
this war in a fortnight.

65
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:27,674
No!

66
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:33,512
- No.
<i>- Follow me!</i>

67
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:39,484
- You'll die for this.
- No, wait, it wasn't her!

00:05:50,796 --> 00:05:54,165
- You'll-.
- No, wa-

69
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:26,331
We've got to leave.

70
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,666
They'll hang you
for this.

71
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:31,803
<i>- Inside the King's tent, go!</i>
- Now!

72
00:06:31,837 --> 00:06:34,873
I won't leave him.

73
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:39,278
You can't avenge him
if you're dead.

74
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:42,548
<i>Over there, go!</i>

75
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:44,817
Not that way.

76
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,122
We need to go home.

77
00:07:21,156 --> 00:07:24,158
- Loras.
- My Lord, My Lady.

78
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:25,693
Get out.

79
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:27,895
Stannis will be here
in an hour.

80
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:30,698
When he arrives, Renly's
bannermen will flock to him.

81
00:07:30,732 --> 00:07:32,934
<i>Your former companions</i>
<i>will fight for the privilege</i>

82
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:35,469
of selling you
to their new king.

83
00:07:35,504 --> 00:07:37,371
And you want that
privilege for yourself.

84
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:40,808
You will note that I am
standing here talking to you,

85
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:43,011
- not Stannis.
- There's no time for this.

86
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,513
Ride back to
Highgarden, sister.

87
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,615
I'm not running
from Stannis.

88
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,884
<i>Brienne of Tarth</i>
<i>murdered Renly.</i>

89
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,220
I don't believe that.
You don't believe that.

90
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,324
Who gained the most
from our king's death?

91
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:57,326
Stannis.

92
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,260
I will put a sword
through his righteous face.

93
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:01,563
You can't stay here.

94
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:04,232
He would have been
a true king,

95
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:06,568
a good king.

96
00:08:06,603 --> 00:08:08,437
<i>Tell me, Ser Loras,</i>

97
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:11,073
what do you desire
most in this world?

98
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:12,941
Revenge.

99
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:15,610
I have always found that to
be the purest of motivations,

100
00:08:15,644 --> 00:08:19,180
but you won't have a chance to
put your sword through Stannis,

101
00:08:19,214 --> 00:08:20,781
<i>not today.</i>

102
00:08:20,815 --> 00:08:23,016
<i>You'll be cut to pieces before</i>
<i>he sets foot on solid ground.</i>

103
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,285
If it is justice
that you want,

104
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,752
be smart about it.

105
00:08:26,787 --> 00:08:29,288
You can't avenge him
from the grave.

106
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:33,392
Bring the horses.

107
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:37,597
Please.

108
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:07,497
He was very handsome.

109
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:10,065
He was, Your Grace.

110
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,234
"Your Grace."

111
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,171
Calling yourself king
doesn't make you one.

112
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:19,507
And if Renly wasn't a king,
I wasn't a queen.

113
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:22,943
Do you want to be a queen?

114
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:25,079
No.

115
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:28,915
I want to be <i>the</i> queen.

116
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:42,732
Killed?
By whom?

117
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:44,334
<i>Accounts differ.</i>

118
00:09:44,368 --> 00:09:47,070
Most seem to implicate
Catelyn Stark in some way.

119
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:48,872
Really?
Who'd have thought?

120
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:51,073
Some say it was one
of his own Kingsguard,

121
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:54,009
while still others say it was
Stannis himself who did it

122
00:09:54,044 --> 00:09:56,011
after negotiations
went sour.

123
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:58,079
Whomever did it,
I say well done.

124
00:09:58,114 --> 00:09:59,547
It's not what Varys says.

125
00:09:59,582 --> 00:10:02,217
He says Renly's army is
<i>flocking to support Stannis,</i>

126
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:06,187
which would give Stannis superiority
over us on both land and sea.

127
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:08,722
Littlefinger says we can
outspend him three to one.

128
00:10:08,757 --> 00:10:11,592
And I say father raised you to
have too much respect for money.

129
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:13,994
<i>Stannis Baratheon</i>
<i>is coming for us,</i>

130
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:15,429
sooner rather than later.

131
00:10:15,463 --> 00:10:16,831
Aren't there other things
you should be doing,

132
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:19,100
like sealing my daughter in a crate
so you can ship her away?

133
00:10:19,134 --> 00:10:20,472
She'll be safer in Dorne.

134
00:10:20,497 --> 00:10:22,204
Yes, I know how concerned
you are for her safety.

135
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,039
It so happens that I am.

136
00:10:24,073 --> 00:10:25,808
Myrcella is a sweet,
innocent girl

137
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:27,743
and I don't blame her
at all for you.

138
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:30,379
So clever.

139
00:10:30,414 --> 00:10:32,882
Aren't you
always so clever

140
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,184
with your schemes
and your plots?

141
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:38,253
Schemes and plots
are the same thing.

142
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:40,289
They are going
to attack us.

143
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:41,923
We need to be ready.

144
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,425
No need to concern
yourself over it.

145
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,795
The King is taking personal
charge of siege preparations.

146
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,465
May I ask specifically
what the King has in mind?

147
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:53,935
You may specifically
or you may ask vaguely.

148
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:56,203
The answer will be
the same.

149
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:04,679
It's important
that we talk about this.

150
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:09,585
It's the King's
royal prerogative

151
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:13,556
to withhold sensitive information
from his councilors.

152
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,234
<i>It's wildfire.</i>

153
00:11:24,302 --> 00:11:26,003
Wildfire?

154
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:30,108
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you, cousin?

155
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,877
- No.
- That's a lie right there.

156
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:35,079
It is not a lie.
Why would I lie?

157
00:11:35,114 --> 00:11:37,381
Tell me,

158
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,117
if the vile allegations

159
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:41,686
against my brother
and sister are true,

160
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,088
do you think it will
make Jaime more likely

161
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:46,457
to kill you or less likely?

162
00:11:46,492 --> 00:11:49,178
When I tell him
you're fucking her, I mean.

163
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:50,961
I'm telling you the truth.

164
00:11:50,962 --> 00:11:52,514
The smart money
would be on more likely.

165
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:54,097
She's making wildfire.

166
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:56,733
But then perhaps his own unnatural
urges will give him sympathy for yours.

167
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:58,201
The alchemists' guild
is being commissioned.

168
00:11:58,235 --> 00:11:59,936
I suppose there's only
one way to find out.

169
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,571
They have thousands of pots
already stored in their vaults.

170
00:12:02,606 --> 00:12:04,740
They are planning to launch
them from the city walls

171
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:06,575
into Stannis's ships
and armies.

172
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:09,244
<i>Please.</i>

173
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,146
When did she
tell you this?

174
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,651
I heard her talking
with the Pyromancer.

175
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:19,522
And the other night
after I left her,

176
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:21,825
she went to meet him.

177
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:24,795
- I swear to you.
- Swear to me on what?

178
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:27,565
- On my life.
- But I don't care about your life.

179
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:29,601
In the Light of the Seven,

180
00:12:29,635 --> 00:12:31,636
by all that is
holy and right,

181
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,138
I, Lancel Lannister,
do solemnly vow--

182
00:12:34,172 --> 00:12:35,568
All right, all right.
Enough.

183
00:12:35,593 --> 00:12:37,593
Even torturing
you is boring.

184
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:40,544
<i>Just get out.</i>

185
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,147
Oh, Lancel,
tell my friend Bronn

186
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:48,184
to please kill you if anything
should happen to me.

187
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:51,286
Please kill me if anything
should happen to Lord Tyrion.

188
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:55,590
It will be my pleasure.

189
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:02,196
- Your Grace.
- What is it?

190
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:03,050
Your Grace.

191
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,032
I'm sorry about
your brother, Your Grace.

192
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:07,512
I wanted to let you know
that people grieve for him.

193
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,168
Your Grace.

194
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:09,970
- Fools love a fool.
- Your Grace.

195
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:12,640
I grieve for him as well--
for the boy he was,

196
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:14,309
not the man
he grew to be.

197
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:16,478
I need to speak to you about
what I saw in that cave.

198
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:18,074
I thought I made it clear
to you there'd be no need to

199
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:19,191
speak to me on this matter.

200
00:13:19,192 --> 00:13:20,021
Your Grace, I--

201
00:13:20,046 --> 00:13:22,046
I've never known you to
need to hear a thing twice.

202
00:13:24,454 --> 00:13:26,255
And I've never known you
to hide from the truth.

203
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,791
You've come to lecture
me on truth?

204
00:13:27,825 --> 00:13:29,526
I've come to tell you
that what I saw--

205
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,661
All my brother's bannermen
have come to my side.

206
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:36,732
Except the Tyrells,
who fled like cowards.

207
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:38,567
They won't be able
to resist us now.

208
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:40,469
Soon I shall be sitting
on the Iron Throne.

209
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:42,337
Nothing is worth
what this will cost you,

210
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:44,806
- not even the Iron--
- I'll hear no more about it.

211
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:55,117
<i>Take a company of men,</i>
<i>secure the perimeter.</i>

212
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:57,987
When do we sail
for King's Landing?

213
00:13:58,021 --> 00:14:00,423
As soon as I've
consolidated my troops.

214
00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:02,325
We'll make short work
of the Lannisters' fleet.

215
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,394
Once Blackwater Bay
is cleared,

216
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:07,531
we'll deliver our troops to their
doorstep and take the city.

217
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,268
And will you bring
Lady Melisandre with you?

218
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,371
That's not your concern.

219
00:14:14,405 --> 00:14:17,874
If you take King's Landing with her
by your side, the victory will be hers.

220
00:14:17,908 --> 00:14:20,276
I never thought I'd have reason to
doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?

221
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,212
Loyal service means
telling hard truths.

222
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:25,581
Oh, truth again.

223
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,717
All right,
what's the truth?

224
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:30,686
The hard truth?

225
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,655
<i>She's a foreigner</i>

226
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:34,790
preaching her
foreign religion.

227
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:39,061
Some believe she whispers orders
in your ear and you obey.

228
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:43,766
What do you believe?

229
00:14:47,338 --> 00:14:50,841
You won those bannermen
from Renly.

230
00:14:50,876 --> 00:14:52,943
Don't lose them to her.

231
00:14:57,882 --> 00:15:00,717
We set out for King's Landing
without Lady Melisandre.

232
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:06,388
And you lead the fleet
into Blackwater Bay.

233
00:15:06,423 --> 00:15:08,957
Your Grace, I'm honored,
but my time on the sea

234
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,626
was spent evading ships,
not attacking them.

235
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,427
The other lords
won't be happy.

236
00:15:13,462 --> 00:15:16,497
Most of those lords should
consider themselves lucky

237
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:18,599
I don't hang them
for treason.

238
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:24,238
Hard truths cut
both ways, Ser Davos.

239
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:41,188
<i>I've got it!</i>
<i>I've got it!</i>

240
00:15:43,224 --> 00:15:46,326
<i>So it's that one there</i>
<i>at the top, on the right.</i>

241
00:15:47,795 --> 00:15:50,497
Buy my fruit, My Lord.
Fresh fruit.

242
00:15:50,531 --> 00:15:52,332
Stannis has more infantry,

243
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:54,234
more ships, more horses.

244
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:55,970
What do we have?

245
00:15:56,004 --> 00:15:58,539
There's that mind of yours
you keep going on about.

246
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:01,909
Well, I've never actually been
able to kill people with it.

247
00:16:01,943 --> 00:16:04,812
Good thing.
I'd be out of a job.

248
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:07,081
<i>What about your father?</i>

249
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:10,451
He hasn't sent
a raven in weeks.

250
00:16:10,485 --> 00:16:12,053
He's very busy.

251
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:15,956
Being repeatedly humiliated by
Robb Stark is time-consuming.

252
00:16:15,991 --> 00:16:18,358
We won't be able to hold
the city against Stannis,

253
00:16:18,393 --> 00:16:20,227
not the way Joffrey's
planning on holding it.

254
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:22,429
Corruption, yes.

255
00:16:22,463 --> 00:16:27,366
We are swollen,
bloated, foul.

256
00:16:27,401 --> 00:16:30,770
Brother fornicates with sister
in the bed of Kings

257
00:16:30,804 --> 00:16:33,706
and we're surprised when the
fruit of their incest is rotten?

258
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:37,877
Yes, a rotten king.

259
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:40,413
It's hard to argue
with his assessment.

260
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,049
Not after what he did
to your birthday present.

261
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,785
The King is a lost cause.

262
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:48,054
It's the rest of us
I'm worried about now.

263
00:16:48,088 --> 00:16:51,925
A dancing king, prancing
down his bloodstained halls

264
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:55,862
to the tune of a twisted
demon monkey.

265
00:16:57,031 --> 00:16:59,933
You have to admire
his imagination.

266
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:03,336
- He's talking about you.
- What?

267
00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:05,305
Demon monkey?

268
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,441
People think you're pulling
the King's strings.

269
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:09,677
They blame you
for the city's ills.

270
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:12,546
Blame me?
I'm trying to save them.

271
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,582
You don't need
to convince me.

272
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,185
Demon monkey.

273
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:20,387
<i>( Seagulls screeching</i>

274
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:48,883
Yeah, come on.

275
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:50,485
You're the crew
of the sea bitch?

276
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,255
I'm your commander.
Welcome.

277
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:57,892
Stop.

278
00:17:57,926 --> 00:18:00,227
Stop!

279
00:18:00,262 --> 00:18:03,430
Your Captain commands
you to stop.

280
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:06,467
Where are we
heading, Captain?

281
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:11,271
The Stony Shore
to raid their villages.

282
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:13,674
<i>There'll be spoils</i>
<i>in it for you, and women,</i>

283
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,243
if you do your jobs well.

284
00:18:15,277 --> 00:18:18,547
And who decides if we've
done our jobs well?

285
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,017
I do.

286
00:18:22,052 --> 00:18:24,086
Your Captain.

287
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:28,625
I have been reaving
and raping

288
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:32,696
since before you left
Balon's balls, Captain.

289
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,867
Don't reckon I've got much use
for your ideas on how to do it.

290
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:40,337
Don't reckon I've got
much use for a captain at all.

291
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:44,375
I'm thinking I can do the job
of captain real well myself.

292
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:46,510
All I need is a ship.

293
00:18:46,544 --> 00:18:48,766
You wouldn't know
where I could find myself

294
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,791
a ship now, would you?

295
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:56,653
You could do that,

296
00:18:56,687 --> 00:18:59,055
take the ship,
head out on your own.

297
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:01,529
And I will hunt you down,
drag you back here in chains,

298
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:03,092
and hang you for a traitor.

299
00:19:03,093 --> 00:19:05,695
Stop. We yield.

300
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:11,901
Congratulations
on your first command.

301
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:14,671
Thank you. Kind of you
to come see me off.

302
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:16,172
Oh, I'm not here
for you.

303
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:19,208
I was just on my way
to Red Harbor.

304
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:23,013
I've got 30 ships. There's
nowhere to put them here.

305
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:26,315
- Too narrow.
- You'd better get out there.

306
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,384
Wouldn't want them
to set sail without you.

307
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,286
That would never happen.

308
00:19:30,321 --> 00:19:34,323
My crew would wait on deck
for a year if I asked them to.

309
00:19:34,358 --> 00:19:36,859
This lot, though...

310
00:19:38,362 --> 00:19:41,097
Enjoy the Stony Shore.

311
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:48,070
Come on,
I'll take you out.

312
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:49,906
Who are you?

313
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,008
Dagmer, your first mate.

314
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,312
Why aren't you with
the rest of them?

315
00:19:55,346 --> 00:19:59,416
Or did they send you to row me
out and dump me halfway in the sea?

316
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,851
That would be good
for a laugh.

317
00:20:00,885 --> 00:20:03,754
They're not gonna respect you
until you prove yourself.

318
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:05,615
And how am I supposed
to prove myself by pillaging

319
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,225
piss-poor fishing villages?

320
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:09,293
You're not.

321
00:20:09,328 --> 00:20:11,496
And yet that's the task
my father has given me

322
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,899
to prove that
I'm a true Iron Islander.

323
00:20:14,933 --> 00:20:17,201
<i>They're all Iron Islanders.</i>

324
00:20:17,236 --> 00:20:20,705
Do they do as they're told
or do they do as they like?

325
00:20:27,746 --> 00:20:30,714
The Stony Shore's not far
from Torrhen's Square.

326
00:20:30,748 --> 00:20:33,384
The seat of the House
of Tallhart--

327
00:20:33,418 --> 00:20:36,320
a more impressive prize than
a few fishermen's daughters.

328
00:20:37,923 --> 00:20:39,614
What, you don't think
we could take it?

329
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:40,792
No, we could.

330
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:42,995
We could never hold it
for more than a few days.

331
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:45,397
As soon as Winterfell got word that
we'd taken Torrhen's Square,

332
00:20:45,432 --> 00:20:48,234
the Starks would send
their men to take it back.

333
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,405
And then--

334
00:20:57,344 --> 00:20:59,779
take me to my ship.

335
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:06,919
The Starks have
overextended their lines.

336
00:21:06,954 --> 00:21:09,021
Now that summer's over,
they'll have a hard time

337
00:21:09,056 --> 00:21:11,123
keeping their men
and horses fed.

338
00:21:11,158 --> 00:21:13,259
The Starks understand winter
better than we ever will.

339
00:21:13,294 --> 00:21:14,995
The cold won't beat them.

340
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:19,633
Our spies report growing
discontent among the northern lords.

341
00:21:19,668 --> 00:21:21,167
They want to return home

342
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:23,836
and gather the harvest
before the crops turn.

343
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,276
And I'm sure if those same spies
snuck into our own encampments,

344
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,480
they would report growing discontent
amongst the southern lords.

345
00:21:30,514 --> 00:21:33,382
This is war;
No one's content.

346
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,354
We've underestimated
the Stark boy for too long.

347
00:21:38,389 --> 00:21:41,724
He has a good mind for warfare,
his men worship him.

348
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,860
And as long as he keeps
winning battles,

349
00:21:43,894 --> 00:21:47,797
they'll keep believing
he is King in the North.

350
00:21:47,831 --> 00:21:49,466
You've been waiting
for him to fail.

351
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,035
He is not going to fail,

352
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:55,038
not without our help.

353
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,708
So how do we stop him?

354
00:21:58,743 --> 00:22:01,111
<i>We've worked through</i>
<i>the night, My Lord.</i>

355
00:22:01,145 --> 00:22:03,446
Perhaps we'd profit
from some sleep.

356
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:05,515
As I think
you would, Reginald.

357
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,117
And because
you're my cousin,

358
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:09,886
I might even let you
wake from that sleep.

359
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,457
Go, I'm sure your wife
must miss you.

360
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:15,225
My wife's in Lannisport.

361
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:17,461
Well, then you'd
better start riding.

362
00:22:18,896 --> 00:22:22,500
Go before I change my mind
and send her your head.

363
00:22:22,534 --> 00:22:24,902
If your name
wasn't Lannister,

364
00:22:24,937 --> 00:22:28,506
you'd be scrubbing out pots
in the cook's tent. Go!

365
00:22:31,376 --> 00:22:33,044
Not wine, water.

366
00:22:33,078 --> 00:22:35,246
We'll be here
for some time.

367
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,887
Girl.

368
00:22:42,922 --> 00:22:44,923
Where are you from?

369
00:22:44,957 --> 00:22:46,825
Maidenpool, My Lord.

370
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,229
And who are the Lords
of Maidenpool?

371
00:22:50,263 --> 00:22:54,133
- Remind me.
- House Mooton, My Lord.

372
00:22:54,168 --> 00:22:56,202
And what is their Sigil?

373
00:23:00,508 --> 00:23:02,142
A red salmon.

374
00:23:02,176 --> 00:23:05,312
I think a Maidenpool girl
would remember that.

375
00:23:06,548 --> 00:23:08,449
You're a northerner,
aren't you?

376
00:23:09,651 --> 00:23:12,719
Good. One more time,
where are you from?

377
00:23:12,754 --> 00:23:15,722
Barrowton, My Lord.
House Dustin.

378
00:23:15,757 --> 00:23:19,827
Two crossed longaxes
beneath a black crown.

379
00:23:21,763 --> 00:23:25,399
And what do they say
of Robb Stark in the North?

380
00:23:27,735 --> 00:23:30,370
They call him
the young wolf.

381
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:32,840
And?

382
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:35,676
They say he rides into battle on
the back of a giant Direwolf.

383
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,983
They say he can turn into
a wolf himself when he wants.

384
00:23:42,018 --> 00:23:43,986
They say he can't be killed.

385
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:46,923
And do you believe them?

386
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:50,827
No, My Lord.

387
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,996
Anyone can be killed.

388
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,339
Fetch that water.

389
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,483
A girl says nothing.

390
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,354
A girl keeps
her mouth closed.

391
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:53,024
<i>No one hears,</i>

392
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:56,928
and friends may talk
in secret, yes?

393
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,734
A boy becomes a girl.

394
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:04,370
I was always a girl.

395
00:25:04,404 --> 00:25:06,606
And I was always aware.

396
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,342
But the girl
keeps secrets.

397
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:12,378
<i>It is not for a man</i>
<i>to spoil them.</i>

398
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:16,015
You're one of them now.

399
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:21,219
I should have let you burn.

400
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,789
And you fetch water
for one of them now.

401
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:29,859
Why is this right for you
and wrong for me?

402
00:25:29,894 --> 00:25:31,595
I didn't have a choice.

403
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:35,699
You did.
I did.

404
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,368
And here we are.

405
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,406
A man pays his debts.

406
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,775
A man owes three.

407
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,076
Three what?

408
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:50,548
The Red God takes
what is his, lovely girl.

409
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,651
And only death
may pay for life.

410
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:57,288
You saved me
and the two I was with.

411
00:25:57,323 --> 00:26:00,225
You stole three deaths
from the Red God.

412
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:05,964
We have to give them back.

413
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:11,302
Speak three names

414
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,905
and the man
will do the rest.

415
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,642
Three lives
I will give you--

416
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:21,012
no more, no less,
and we're done.

417
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,547
I can name anyone

418
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,883
and you'll kill him?

419
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:29,587
A man has said.

420
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,157
The one who
tortures everyone.

421
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,891
A man needs a name.

422
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,260
I don't know his name.

423
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,296
They call him
the Tickler.

424
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,497
That is enough.

425
00:26:41,532 --> 00:26:45,634
Go now, girl.
Your master is thirsty.

426
00:26:58,982 --> 00:27:00,415
<i>He's not here yet.</i>

427
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,885
He'd have seen us,
blown the horn.

428
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:05,087
When will he come?

429
00:27:05,122 --> 00:27:07,123
The Halfhand does things
in his own time.

430
00:27:07,157 --> 00:27:09,425
My uncle told me
stories about him.

431
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,494
Most of them are true.

432
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:14,197
I heard the Halfhand spent half
of last winter beyond the wall.

433
00:27:14,231 --> 00:27:15,765
The whole winter.

434
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:18,467
He was north of the Skirling Pass
when the snows came.

435
00:27:18,502 --> 00:27:20,169
Had to wait for the thaw.

436
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:24,172
So it is possible for someone
to survive out here on their own.

437
00:27:24,206 --> 00:27:27,609
Well, possible
for the Halfhand.

438
00:27:27,643 --> 00:27:29,444
Beautiful, isn't it?

439
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:32,012
Gilly would love it here.

440
00:27:32,047 --> 00:27:35,649
There's nothing more sickening
than a man in love.

441
00:28:03,076 --> 00:28:05,377
<i>About time you did something.</i>

442
00:28:05,411 --> 00:28:08,179
<i>At least you'll keep warm.</i>

443
00:28:09,749 --> 00:28:12,417
The fist
of the First Men.

444
00:28:12,452 --> 00:28:15,955
Think of how old
this place is--

445
00:28:15,989 --> 00:28:18,558
before the Targaryens
defeated the Hendals,

446
00:28:18,592 --> 00:28:21,361
before the Andals took
Westeros from the First Men.

447
00:28:21,395 --> 00:28:24,564
Before I die, please,
stop talking.

448
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,834
Thousands and thousands
of years ago,

449
00:28:26,868 --> 00:28:29,938
the First Men stood here
where we're standing

450
00:28:29,972 --> 00:28:32,273
all through the long night.

451
00:28:34,343 --> 00:28:36,744
What do you think they
were like, the First Men?

452
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:38,379
Stupid.

453
00:28:38,413 --> 00:28:41,583
Smart people don't find
themselves in places like this.

454
00:28:41,617 --> 00:28:44,152
I think
they were afraid.

455
00:28:45,488 --> 00:28:48,223
I think they came here
to get away from something.

456
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:51,793
And I don't think
it worked.

457
00:28:55,664 --> 00:28:57,265
Wildlings?

458
00:28:59,635 --> 00:29:02,003
One blast is for rangers returning.

459
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:03,705
Wildlings is two blasts.

460
00:29:03,739 --> 00:29:07,208
So you got to stand
there waiting,

461
00:29:07,242 --> 00:29:09,309
<i>wondering.</i>

462
00:29:09,344 --> 00:29:10,978
<i>One blast for friends,</i>

463
00:29:11,013 --> 00:29:13,915
<i>two for foes.</i>

464
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:21,256
And three
for White Walkers.

465
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:23,192
It's been 1,000 years,

466
00:29:23,226 --> 00:29:25,962
but that's the only time
they blow the horn three times.

467
00:29:25,996 --> 00:29:29,098
But if it's been 1,000 years,
how do you know?

468
00:29:29,132 --> 00:29:32,834
- Well...
- I read it in a book.

469
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:34,970
Look.

470
00:29:36,138 --> 00:29:38,272
It's Qhorin Halfhand.

471
00:29:38,307 --> 00:29:41,509
Aye, we'll live
another day.

472
00:29:41,543 --> 00:29:44,111
Hurrah.

473
00:29:53,454 --> 00:29:56,323
Take care, My Lord.

474
00:29:56,357 --> 00:29:59,326
I remember reading
an old sailor's proverb--

475
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,296
"piss on wildfire
and your cock burns off."

476
00:30:02,331 --> 00:30:05,967
Oh, I have not conducted
this experiment.

477
00:30:06,001 --> 00:30:08,603
It could well be true.

478
00:30:08,638 --> 00:30:10,472
The substance
burns so hot,

479
00:30:10,506 --> 00:30:13,641
it melts wood,
stone, even steel,

480
00:30:13,676 --> 00:30:16,978
and, of course, flesh.

481
00:30:17,012 --> 00:30:21,515
The substance burns so hot,
it melts flesh like tallow.

482
00:30:24,852 --> 00:30:28,188
After the dragons died,
wildfire was the key

483
00:30:28,222 --> 00:30:29,990
to the Targaryen power.

484
00:30:30,024 --> 00:30:33,060
My companion takes issue.

485
00:30:33,094 --> 00:30:35,429
If I could tell you
how many crazy old men

486
00:30:35,463 --> 00:30:37,598
I've seen pushing carts
around army camps

487
00:30:37,632 --> 00:30:41,335
making grand claims about
jars full of pig shit...

488
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:44,605
- No offense meant.
- Our order does not deal in pig shit.

489
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,341
The substance
is fire given form.

490
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:50,944
And we have been perfecting it
since the days of Maegor.

491
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:52,312
To do what?

492
00:30:52,347 --> 00:30:55,749
The jars are put in catapults
and flung at the enemy.

493
00:30:55,783 --> 00:30:58,451
How much do you have?

494
00:31:01,288 --> 00:31:05,123
If you could get real soldiers
to man the catapults,

495
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:08,525
then maybe you'd hit
your target one time in 10,

496
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,694
but all the real soldiers are in
the Riverlands with your father.

497
00:31:11,728 --> 00:31:14,363
My Lord, this man
is insulting.

498
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:16,699
I don't know if you've
ever seen a battle, old man,

499
00:31:16,734 --> 00:31:18,368
but things can get
a bit messy.

500
00:31:18,402 --> 00:31:19,769
'Cause when we're flinging
things at Stannis,

501
00:31:19,803 --> 00:31:21,571
he's flinging them
right back at us.

502
00:31:21,605 --> 00:31:24,440
Men die, men shit
themselves, men run,

503
00:31:24,474 --> 00:31:26,208
which means
pots falling,

504
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:28,143
which means fire
inside the walls,

505
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:30,444
which means the poor cunts
trying to defend the city

506
00:31:30,469 --> 00:31:32,469
end up burning it down.

507
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:35,049
My friend remains
unconvinced.

508
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:37,418
He would not dare
insult my order

509
00:31:37,452 --> 00:31:39,152
whilst Aerys Targaryen
lived.

510
00:31:39,187 --> 00:31:41,788
Well, he's not
living anymore.

511
00:31:41,822 --> 00:31:44,924
And all his pots of wildfire
didn't help him, did they?

512
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:48,928
Men win wars,
not magic tricks.

513
00:32:04,242 --> 00:32:08,511
We have been working
tirelessly day and night

514
00:32:08,546 --> 00:32:13,015
ever since your royal sister
commanded us to do so.

515
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:15,184
Our present count stands

516
00:32:15,218 --> 00:32:18,720
at 7,811,

517
00:32:18,754 --> 00:32:22,223
enough to burn Stannis
Baratheon's fleet

518
00:32:22,257 --> 00:32:24,358
and armies both.

519
00:32:24,393 --> 00:32:27,094
This is a shit idea.

520
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:30,997
I'm afraid I have to concur
with my advisor, wisdom Hallyne.

521
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:35,268
The contents of this room
could lay King's Landing low.

522
00:32:36,904 --> 00:32:40,639
You won't be making wildfire
for my sister any longer.

523
00:32:42,242 --> 00:32:44,877
You'll be making it
for me.

524
00:32:53,754 --> 00:32:56,022
Dracarys.

525
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,999
Dracarys.

526
00:33:15,644 --> 00:33:18,446
He'll be able to feed
himself from now on.

527
00:33:21,783 --> 00:33:24,351
<i>Let him sleep, Doreah.</i>

528
00:33:24,386 --> 00:33:27,155
Yes, Khaleesi.

529
00:33:29,358 --> 00:33:31,326
He loves you.

530
00:33:42,205 --> 00:33:44,407
Thank you, my friend.

531
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:49,579
Did you see the dress
Xaro had made for you?

532
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:52,648
They say he's the
wealthiest man in Qarth.

533
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:54,917
It is known.

534
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:57,954
And if Qarth is the wealthiest
city in Essos--

535
00:33:57,989 --> 00:33:59,889
The last time a rich man
gave me a dress,

536
00:33:59,923 --> 00:34:02,658
he was selling me
to Khal Drogo.

537
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:12,034
Xaro is our host,
but we know nothing about him.

538
00:34:12,068 --> 00:34:14,837
Men like to talk
about other men

539
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:16,873
when they're happy.

540
00:34:24,415 --> 00:34:26,516
You would look like
a real princess in Xaro's--

541
00:34:26,551 --> 00:34:29,587
She's not a princess.
She's a Khaleesi.

542
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,861
You should wear it,
Khaleesi.

543
00:34:37,895 --> 00:34:39,362
You are their guest.

544
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:41,998
It would be rude not to.

545
00:35:02,353 --> 00:35:04,221
And you must visit
the night market.

546
00:35:04,255 --> 00:35:09,093
The Qartheen night market is like
no night market you've ever seen.

547
00:35:09,128 --> 00:35:10,996
It sounds wonderful.

548
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,998
The Meereens think
they have a night market.

549
00:35:13,033 --> 00:35:15,300
I will take you
there myself.

550
00:35:15,334 --> 00:35:18,770
Please excuse me
for a moment.

551
00:35:21,174 --> 00:35:23,509
What are they doing?

552
00:35:23,543 --> 00:35:27,279
Malakko says the statue
is too heavy to carry.

553
00:35:27,314 --> 00:35:28,648
Kovarro says that
Malakko is an idiot.

554
00:35:28,682 --> 00:35:31,384
<i>They can pry out the gems,</i>
<i>the rest is pure gold.</i>

555
00:35:31,418 --> 00:35:35,021
Very soft. He can chop off
as much as we can carry.

556
00:36:02,684 --> 00:36:05,552
My brother used to say the only
thing the Dothraki knew how to do

557
00:36:05,586 --> 00:36:07,621
was steal things
better men have built.

558
00:36:07,655 --> 00:36:09,356
It's not the only thing.

559
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,191
They're quite good
at killing the better men.

560
00:36:11,225 --> 00:36:14,227
That's not the kind of queen
I'm going to be.

561
00:36:14,261 --> 00:36:17,130
Mother of Dragons.

562
00:36:17,164 --> 00:36:19,366
On behalf of the warlocks
of Qarth,

563
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,501
I welcome you.

564
00:36:22,736 --> 00:36:24,737
A demonstration?

565
00:36:26,707 --> 00:36:29,876
Take this gem.
Look at it.

566
00:36:31,245 --> 00:36:33,646
Into its depths.

567
00:36:33,681 --> 00:36:36,015
So many facets.

568
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:40,186
Look closely enough and you
can see yourself in them.

569
00:36:42,489 --> 00:36:44,690
Often more than once.

570
00:36:47,861 --> 00:36:51,563
Should you grow tired of
Xaro's baubles and trinkets,

571
00:36:51,597 --> 00:36:54,933
it would be an honor to host you
at the House of the Undying.

572
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:57,402
You're always welcome,

573
00:36:57,436 --> 00:37:00,105
Mother of Dragons.

574
00:37:06,646 --> 00:37:08,981
My apologies.

575
00:37:09,015 --> 00:37:11,583
Pyat Pree is one
of the Thirteen.

576
00:37:11,618 --> 00:37:14,019
It was customary for me
to extend him an invitation.

577
00:37:14,053 --> 00:37:17,188
Customs die
slow deaths in Qarth.

578
00:37:17,222 --> 00:37:19,990
What is the House
of the Undying?

579
00:37:20,025 --> 00:37:23,627
It is where the warlocks go
to squint at dusty books

580
00:37:23,661 --> 00:37:25,228
and drink shade
of the evening.

581
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:29,332
It turns their lips blue
and their minds soft--

582
00:37:29,366 --> 00:37:32,234
so soft,
they actually believe

583
00:37:32,268 --> 00:37:34,269
their parlor tricks
are magic.

584
00:37:37,941 --> 00:37:40,576
<i>You watch over her.</i>

585
00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:44,147
Do I know you?

586
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:46,083
I know you.

587
00:37:46,117 --> 00:37:49,653
Jorah Mormont
of Bear Island.

588
00:37:49,687 --> 00:37:51,422
Who are you?

589
00:37:51,456 --> 00:37:53,758
I'm no one.

590
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,760
But she is
the Mother of Dragons.

591
00:37:55,794 --> 00:37:59,397
She needs true protectors
now more than ever.

592
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:01,399
They shall come
day and night

593
00:38:01,433 --> 00:38:03,935
to see the wonder born
into the world again.

594
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:07,473
And when they see,
they shall lust,

595
00:38:07,507 --> 00:38:11,310
for dragons are fire
made flesh.

596
00:38:11,345 --> 00:38:13,946
And fire is power.

597
00:38:24,257 --> 00:38:26,525
It looked like Stannis.

598
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:29,994
To me it just
looked like...

599
00:38:33,433 --> 00:38:36,101
A shadow in
the shape of a man.

600
00:38:36,135 --> 00:38:38,170
In the shape
of Stannis.

601
00:38:42,543 --> 00:38:45,245
We should reach
my son's camp tomorrow.

602
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:47,380
Will you stay there
long, My Lady?

603
00:38:47,415 --> 00:38:51,084
Only long enough to tell
Robb what I have seen.

604
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,421
After that, I will leave
for Winterfell.

605
00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:57,757
My two youngest need me.

606
00:38:57,791 --> 00:39:00,926
I've been away from them
for far too long.

607
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,862
I never knew my mother.

608
00:39:04,897 --> 00:39:06,397
I'm sorry.

609
00:39:06,432 --> 00:39:10,134
My own mother died
on the birthing bed

610
00:39:10,168 --> 00:39:13,003
when I was very young.

611
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:18,776
It's a bloody business.

612
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:22,346
What comes after
is even harder.

613
00:39:24,015 --> 00:39:27,151
Once you're safely back
amongst your own people,

614
00:39:27,185 --> 00:39:30,321
will you give me leave
to go, My Lady?

615
00:39:30,355 --> 00:39:32,557
You mean to kill Stannis.

616
00:39:32,591 --> 00:39:34,225
I swore a vow.

617
00:39:34,259 --> 00:39:37,528
But Stannis has
a great army around him.

618
00:39:37,562 --> 00:39:40,064
His own guards are sworn
to keep him safe.

619
00:39:40,098 --> 00:39:41,965
<i>I'm as good</i>
<i>as any of them.</i>

620
00:39:43,435 --> 00:39:44,868
I should never have fled.

621
00:39:44,903 --> 00:39:48,638
Renly's death
was no fault of yours.

622
00:39:48,672 --> 00:39:50,506
You served him bravely.

623
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:54,545
I only held him
that once

624
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:57,214
as he was dying.

625
00:39:59,684 --> 00:40:01,318
He's gone, Brienne.

626
00:40:01,353 --> 00:40:05,957
You serve nothing and no one
by following him into the earth.

627
00:40:07,226 --> 00:40:10,329
Renly's enemies are
Robb's enemies as well.

628
00:40:14,968 --> 00:40:17,002
I do not know
your son, My Lady...

629
00:40:19,205 --> 00:40:23,174
but I could serve you
if you would have me.

630
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:25,276
<i>You have courage.</i>

631
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,778
Not battle courage, perhaps,

632
00:40:27,812 --> 00:40:31,248
but, I don't know,

633
00:40:31,283 --> 00:40:33,183
a woman's kind of courage.

634
00:40:33,218 --> 00:40:35,720
<i>And I think that</i>
<i>when the time comes,</i>

635
00:40:35,754 --> 00:40:37,221
<i>you will not hold me back.</i>

636
00:40:37,256 --> 00:40:39,958
Promise me that you
will not hold me back

637
00:40:39,992 --> 00:40:42,327
from Stannis.

638
00:40:46,899 --> 00:40:50,202
When the time comes,
I will not hold you back.

639
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:59,144
Then I am yours,
My Lady.

640
00:41:00,246 --> 00:41:01,747
I will shield your back

641
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:04,850
and give my life for yours
if it comes to that.

642
00:41:04,884 --> 00:41:08,486
I swear it by the Old Gods
and the new.

643
00:41:15,428 --> 00:41:18,998
I vow that you shall always
have a place in my home

644
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:21,000
and at my table

645
00:41:21,034 --> 00:41:23,469
and that I shall ask
no service of you

646
00:41:23,504 --> 00:41:26,072
that might
bring you dishonor.

647
00:41:26,106 --> 00:41:29,175
I swear it by the Old Gods
and the new.

648
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:34,646
<i>And it's not</i>
<i>just thieves, My Lord.</i>

649
00:41:34,982 --> 00:41:37,851
<i>There's wolves</i>
<i>in them hills now,</i>

650
00:41:37,885 --> 00:41:40,186
more than I've ever seen.

651
00:41:40,221 --> 00:41:43,257
They come down in the night
and they kill my sheep.

652
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:47,127
My three sons is away fighting
for your brother, My Lord.

653
00:41:47,161 --> 00:41:49,362
They'll fight,
keep fighting

654
00:41:49,396 --> 00:41:51,531
till they're told
to go home.

655
00:41:51,565 --> 00:41:54,167
I have no one to man
my flock now. Only me.

656
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:57,836
I can't keep watch
all day and all night.

657
00:41:59,873 --> 00:42:02,674
We can send two orphan boys
from Winterstown home with you

658
00:42:02,709 --> 00:42:04,442
to help watch over
your flock

659
00:42:04,477 --> 00:42:06,277
if you can give them
room and board.

660
00:42:06,312 --> 00:42:09,013
My wife always prayed
for more children.

661
00:42:09,047 --> 00:42:11,415
We'll look after them.
Thank you, My Lord.

662
00:42:11,449 --> 00:42:14,786
And may the Gods
bless you and yours.

663
00:42:17,657 --> 00:42:19,792
Stop it.

664
00:42:19,826 --> 00:42:23,129
If that's everyone, I'm going
to go for a ride before dark.

665
00:42:23,163 --> 00:42:25,165
- Good.
- Hodor.

666
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:29,136
- Hodor.
Bran-- Lord Stark.

667
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,905
Torrhen's Square
is under siege.

668
00:42:30,939 --> 00:42:33,607
Torrhen's Square is barely
40 leagues from here.

669
00:42:33,641 --> 00:42:36,710
<i>How can the Lannisters</i>
<i>strike so far north?</i>

670
00:42:36,745 --> 00:42:39,346
Might be a raiding party
led by the Mountain.

671
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,881
Might be Sellswords
paid by Tywin Lannister.

672
00:42:41,916 --> 00:42:43,149
We have to help them.

673
00:42:43,184 --> 00:42:44,684
Most of the fighting men
are away with Robb,

674
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:46,419
but I can gather
200 decent men.

675
00:42:46,453 --> 00:42:47,680
Do you need so many?

676
00:42:47,705 --> 00:42:49,222
If we can't protect
our own bannermen,

677
00:42:49,223 --> 00:42:52,025
why should
they protect us?

678
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:54,828
Go, Ser Rodrik.
Take the men you need.

679
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,330
Won't take long, My Lord.

680
00:42:56,364 --> 00:42:58,165
Southerners don't
do well up here.

681
00:43:08,578 --> 00:43:11,113
So, what does it mean?

682
00:43:11,147 --> 00:43:12,189
Ask your Maester Luwin.

683
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,368
He's the one studying
books all the time.

684
00:43:14,517 --> 00:43:17,853
I did ask him. He'd never
heard of a three-eyed raven.

685
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:21,490
- Must not mean anything, then
- You're lying.

686
00:43:21,524 --> 00:43:24,292
You might be a little lord,
but don't you call me a liar.

687
00:43:24,326 --> 00:43:27,562
- You know what it means.
- I never said I didn't.

688
00:43:27,596 --> 00:43:29,530
You didn't give me
an honest answer.

689
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,567
That's not the same
as being a liar.

690
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:34,202
Well, it's not far off.

691
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:38,340
So, you've been dreaming
of a three-eyed raven again?

692
00:43:39,776 --> 00:43:43,078
In the Godswood,
you told me you didn't dream.

693
00:43:43,113 --> 00:43:45,147
Now who's a liar?

694
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:50,953
What did you see
in your dream?

695
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,658
Something bad?

696
00:43:55,692 --> 00:43:57,893
Tell me, boy.

697
00:44:01,231 --> 00:44:04,166
I dreamt that the sea
came to Winterfell.

698
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:08,069
I saw waves crashing
against the gates

699
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:11,806
and the water came
flowing over the walls...

700
00:44:14,143 --> 00:44:16,645
<i>flooded the castle.</i>

701
00:44:18,848 --> 00:44:21,049
Drowned men
were floating here

702
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:23,218
in the yard.

703
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,824
Ser Rodrik
was one of them.

704
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,562
The sea is hundreds
of miles away.

705
00:44:33,597 --> 00:44:35,211
I know.

706
00:44:35,212 --> 00:44:36,537
It's just a stupid dream.

707
00:44:36,562 --> 00:44:38,433
I've got to get these
potatoes to the kitchen.

708
00:44:38,434 --> 00:44:39,935
Otherwise they'll put me
in chains again.

709
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:42,371
Osha.

710
00:44:42,405 --> 00:44:44,874
The three-eyed raven,

711
00:44:44,908 --> 00:44:47,377
what do they say about it

712
00:44:47,412 --> 00:44:50,213
north of the wall?

713
00:44:50,248 --> 00:44:53,550
They say all sorts of crazy
things north of the wall.

714
00:45:04,696 --> 00:45:07,097
- There.
<i>- Where?</i>

715
00:45:07,131 --> 00:45:08,898
On that Mountain.

716
00:45:08,932 --> 00:45:11,400
I don't see very well.

717
00:45:11,435 --> 00:45:13,035
A fire.

718
00:45:15,306 --> 00:45:18,308
There's a fire.

719
00:45:18,342 --> 00:45:21,478
<i>The people sitting around it have</i>
<i>better eyes than yours or mine.</i>

720
00:45:21,512 --> 00:45:24,581
When they see us coming,
that fire becomes a signal.

721
00:45:24,615 --> 00:45:28,185
Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time.
to throw a party in our honor.

722
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,288
How many wildlings
have joined him?

723
00:45:30,322 --> 00:45:34,491
From what we can tell,
all of them.

724
00:45:39,063 --> 00:45:41,498
<i>Mance has gathered them all</i>
<i>like deer against the wolves.</i>

725
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:43,534
<i>They're almost ready</i>
<i>to make their move.</i>

726
00:45:43,568 --> 00:45:45,502
Where?

727
00:45:45,536 --> 00:45:47,371
Somewhere safe.

728
00:45:47,405 --> 00:45:49,239
Somewhere south.

729
00:45:49,273 --> 00:45:52,208
<i>Can't just march</i>
<i>into their midst.</i>

730
00:45:52,242 --> 00:45:54,029
And we can't wait for them
here with nothing but a pile

731
00:45:54,054 --> 00:45:55,879
of stones to protect us.

732
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,816
You saying we should
fall back to the Wall?

733
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:02,253
Mance was one of us once.

734
00:46:02,288 --> 00:46:04,689
Now he's one of them.

735
00:46:04,724 --> 00:46:07,459
He's gonna teach them
our way of doing things.

736
00:46:07,494 --> 00:46:09,395
They'll hit us in force.

737
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:11,832
And they won't run away
when we hit back.

738
00:46:11,866 --> 00:46:14,301
<i>They're gonna be more</i>
<i>organized than before,</i>

739
00:46:14,335 --> 00:46:16,236
<i>more disciplined</i>

740
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:18,305
more like us.

741
00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:20,941
So we need to be
more like them,

742
00:46:20,975 --> 00:46:22,876
do things their way.

743
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:26,079
Sneak in, kill Mance,

744
00:46:26,113 --> 00:46:27,714
and scatter them
to the winds

745
00:46:27,748 --> 00:46:29,782
before they can march
on the Wall.

746
00:46:29,816 --> 00:46:30,663
And to do that...

747
00:46:30,688 --> 00:46:32,680
We need to get rid
of those lookouts.

748
00:46:32,853 --> 00:46:34,654
It's not a job
for 400 men.

749
00:46:34,688 --> 00:46:38,391
I need to move fast
and silent.

750
00:46:38,425 --> 00:46:42,128
Harker, Stonesnake,
Borba.

751
00:46:43,364 --> 00:46:45,565
Lord Commander, I'd like
to join Lord Qhorin.

752
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,201
I've been called
lots of things,

753
00:46:48,235 --> 00:46:50,123
but that might be
my first Lord Qhorin.

754
00:46:50,604 --> 00:46:53,473
You're a steward,
Snow, not a ranger.

755
00:46:53,508 --> 00:46:55,742
I've fought
and killed a Wight.

756
00:46:55,777 --> 00:46:57,978
How many rangers
can say that?

757
00:46:58,013 --> 00:47:00,047
He's the one?

758
00:47:01,149 --> 00:47:03,550
Aye.
You killed a Wight.

759
00:47:03,585 --> 00:47:05,452
You also let an old man

760
00:47:05,487 --> 00:47:08,322
beat you bloody
and take your sword.

761
00:47:08,356 --> 00:47:10,691
<i>Craster?</i>

762
00:47:10,725 --> 00:47:13,727
In the boy's defense,
that's a tough old goat.

763
00:47:16,664 --> 00:47:19,466
I could take up Jon's duties
while he's gone, My Lord.

764
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,135
It would be no trouble.

765
00:47:30,177 --> 00:47:33,580
Well, I hope you make
a better ranger

766
00:47:33,614 --> 00:47:35,949
than you do a steward.

767
00:47:37,652 --> 00:47:39,352
Go on.

768
00:47:46,528 --> 00:47:48,363
<i>So, tell me,</i>

769
00:47:48,397 --> 00:47:51,500
how long has your manservant
been in love with you?

770
00:47:51,534 --> 00:47:55,237
He's not my manservant
and he's not in love with me.

771
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:57,339
He's my advisor,

772
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,341
my friend.

773
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,910
Unlikely.

774
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:03,680
I can almost always tell
what a man wants.

775
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,049
And what about
what a woman wants?

776
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,151
Much more complicated.

777
00:48:08,186 --> 00:48:10,220
You, for example,

778
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:12,823
what do you want?

779
00:48:12,857 --> 00:48:15,893
To cross the Narrow Sea
and take back the Iron Throne.

780
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:17,461
Why?

781
00:48:17,496 --> 00:48:19,230
Because I promised
my Khalasar I'd protect them

782
00:48:19,264 --> 00:48:21,666
and find them a safe home.

783
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,304
You want to conquer
the Seven Kingdoms?

784
00:48:25,338 --> 00:48:27,006
I want them because
they're mine by right.

785
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,109
The Iron Throne is mine
and I will take it.

786
00:48:30,144 --> 00:48:31,944
Ah, a conqueror.

787
00:48:31,979 --> 00:48:34,113
And how did you get
all of this?

788
00:48:34,147 --> 00:48:36,182
- Did someone give it to you?
- No.

789
00:48:36,216 --> 00:48:37,716
I come from nothing.

790
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:39,918
I hit the docks
like a piece of cargo,

791
00:48:39,953 --> 00:48:42,554
except someone normally
cares what happens to cargo.

792
00:48:42,556 --> 00:48:45,290
So you wanted more than
you had and you took it.

793
00:48:45,324 --> 00:48:49,260
You're a conqueror, too.
you're just less ambitious.

794
00:48:50,996 --> 00:48:53,465
Mmm.

795
00:48:53,499 --> 00:48:56,635
What do you want,
Xaro Zhoan Daxos?

796
00:48:56,669 --> 00:48:59,371
At the gates of the city,
you bled for me.

797
00:48:59,405 --> 00:49:02,408
Why?

798
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:04,777
I will show you why.

799
00:49:08,135 --> 00:49:11,338
The door and the vault
is made of Valyrian stone.

800
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:15,322
The hardest steel
does not make a mark.

801
00:49:15,356 --> 00:49:18,725
I offered the greatest
locksmiths in Qarth

802
00:49:18,759 --> 00:49:21,094
their weight in gold
if they could break into it.

803
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:23,696
I made the same offer
to the greatest thieves.

804
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:26,432
They all went home
empty-handed.

805
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:29,735
The only thing that
can open this door

806
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:31,903
is this key.

807
00:49:31,938 --> 00:49:33,372
And behind the door?

808
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,878
And it can all be mine?

809
00:49:38,913 --> 00:49:40,580
All?

810
00:49:40,615 --> 00:49:44,084
Let us say half.

811
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:48,356
More than enough to buy
horses, ships, armies--

812
00:49:48,391 --> 00:49:50,492
enough to go home.

813
00:49:50,526 --> 00:49:53,429
All I have to do?

814
00:49:53,463 --> 00:49:54,797
Is marry me.

815
00:49:54,831 --> 00:49:57,933
That was a romantic proposal.

816
00:49:57,967 --> 00:50:00,302
I've already married
once for love,

817
00:50:00,337 --> 00:50:03,072
but the Gods
stole her from me.

818
00:50:05,409 --> 00:50:07,310
I come from nothing.

819
00:50:07,344 --> 00:50:10,212
My mother and father
never owned a pair of shoes.

820
00:50:10,246 --> 00:50:13,382
But marry me and I will
give you the Seven Kingdoms

821
00:50:13,416 --> 00:50:17,153
and our children will be
Princes and Princesses.

822
00:50:19,389 --> 00:50:21,423
See?

823
00:50:21,457 --> 00:50:24,093
I have more ambition
than you thought.

824
00:50:25,562 --> 00:50:27,671
The time is right,
Daenerys Targaryen,

825
00:50:27,696 --> 00:50:29,696
first of your name.

826
00:50:30,067 --> 00:50:32,536
Robert Baratheon
is dead.

827
00:50:39,377 --> 00:50:41,712
<i>If you cross the sea</i>
<i>with an army you bought--</i>

828
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,015
The Seven Kingdoms are
at war with one another.

829
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:46,451
Four false kings
destroying the country.

830
00:50:46,486 --> 00:50:49,788
To win Westeros, you need
support from Westeros.

831
00:50:49,823 --> 00:50:51,623
The usurper is dead.

832
00:50:51,658 --> 00:50:53,325
The Starks fight
the Lannisters,

833
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,260
and Baratheons
fight each other.

834
00:50:55,294 --> 00:50:56,828
According to
your new friend

835
00:50:56,862 --> 00:50:58,596
who earned your trust
by cutting his hand?

836
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:01,499
The time to strike is now. We need
to find ships and an army

837
00:51:01,533 --> 00:51:03,423
or we'll spend the rest
of our lives rotting away

838
00:51:03,448 --> 00:51:04,469
at the edge of the world.

839
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,904
Rich men do not become rich
by giving more than they get.

840
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,673
They'll give you ships and soldiers
and they'll own you forever.

841
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:13,443
Moving carefully is the hard way,
but it's the right way.

842
00:51:13,478 --> 00:51:14,911
And if I'd listened
to that advice

843
00:51:14,945 --> 00:51:17,147
outside the gates of Qarth,
we'd all be dead by now.

844
00:51:17,181 --> 00:51:20,250
I know the opportunity before you
seems like the last you'll ever have,

845
00:51:20,284 --> 00:51:20,991
but you must--

846
00:51:21,016 --> 00:51:23,016
Do not speak to me
like I'm a child.

847
00:51:26,424 --> 00:51:28,792
- I only want--
- What do you want?

848
00:51:28,826 --> 00:51:31,394
Tell me.

849
00:51:31,429 --> 00:51:32,963
To see you
on the Iron Throne.

850
00:51:32,997 --> 00:51:35,732
- Why?
- You have a good claim.

851
00:51:35,766 --> 00:51:38,568
A title.
A birthright.

852
00:51:38,602 --> 00:51:41,804
But you have something
more than that.

853
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:46,075
You may cover it up and deny it,
but you have a gentle heart.

854
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:48,611
You would not only
be respected and feared,

855
00:51:48,646 --> 00:51:51,147
you would be loved.

856
00:51:51,181 --> 00:51:53,315
Someone who can rule
and should rule.

857
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:55,439
Centuries come and go
without a person like that

858
00:51:55,464 --> 00:51:57,464
coming into the world.

859
00:51:58,154 --> 00:51:59,721
There are times
when I look at you

860
00:51:59,755 --> 00:52:02,623
and still can't
believe you're real.

861
00:52:14,602 --> 00:52:17,938
So what would you
have me do as my advisor?

862
00:52:23,911 --> 00:52:25,711
<i>Make your own way.</i>

863
00:52:25,746 --> 00:52:28,547
Find your own ship.
You only need one.

864
00:52:28,581 --> 00:52:32,017
The allies we need
are in Westeros, not Qarth.

865
00:52:33,253 --> 00:52:35,721
And how do I get
the ship?

866
00:52:35,755 --> 00:52:38,257
<i>I'll find it for you.</i>

867
00:52:38,291 --> 00:52:40,426
A sound ship
with a good captain.

868
00:52:46,034 --> 00:52:48,735
I look forward
to meeting him.

869
00:52:52,006 --> 00:52:54,140
Khaleesi.

870
00:53:23,673 --> 00:53:25,809
You should stand
sideface.

871
00:53:25,843 --> 00:53:27,978
Sideface?

872
00:53:28,012 --> 00:53:30,114
Sideways.

873
00:53:30,148 --> 00:53:32,549
- Why?
- Smaller target.

874
00:53:35,753 --> 00:53:37,721
Am I fighting someone?

875
00:53:37,755 --> 00:53:40,123
You're practicing
for a fight.

876
00:53:41,091 --> 00:53:42,759
You should practice right.

877
00:53:46,096 --> 00:53:48,031
Guards!

878
00:53:48,065 --> 00:53:51,067
- Help.
- Did you see anything?

879
00:53:52,903 --> 00:53:56,705
Go up there. Go and see where
he fell from.

880
00:54:00,442 --> 00:54:02,410
Go up the back.

881
00:54:02,444 --> 00:54:04,645
<i>That is strange.</i>

882
00:54:11,252 --> 00:54:13,252
Move away.

883
00:54:14,888 --> 00:54:18,358
<i>Stand back.</i>
<i>He's dead.</i>

884
00:54:29,527 --> 00:54:33,527
