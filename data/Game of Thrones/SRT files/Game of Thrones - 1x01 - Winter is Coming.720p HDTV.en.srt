1
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:58,420
Easy, boy.

2
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:56,881
<i>( Gasps</i>

3
00:03:11,162 --> 00:03:13,331
<i>What do you expect?</i>
<i>They're savages.</i>

4
00:03:13,365 --> 00:03:15,700
One lot steals a goat
from another lot,

5
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:18,737
before you know it they're ripping
each other to pieces.

6
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:20,939
I've never seen wildlings
do a thing like this.

7
00:03:20,974 --> 00:03:23,275
I never seen a thing like this,
not ever in my life.

8
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,179
How close did you get?

9
00:03:26,213 --> 00:03:29,148
- Close as any man would.
- We should head back to the wall.

10
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:33,319
Do the dead frighten you?

11
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:35,788
Our orders were
to track the wildlings.

12
00:03:35,822 --> 00:03:38,657
We tracked them.
They won't trouble us no more.

13
00:03:38,691 --> 00:03:41,360
You don't think
he'll ask us how they died?

14
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:45,297
Get back on your horse.

15
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:52,170
Whatever did it to them
could do it to us.

16
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:54,172
They even killed
the children.

17
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:57,276
It's a good thing
we're not children.

18
00:03:58,778 --> 00:04:01,380
You want to run away south,
run away.

19
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:04,317
Of course they will
behead you as a deserter,

20
00:04:04,351 --> 00:04:06,720
if I don't
catch you first.

21
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,258
Get back on your horse.

22
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,260
I won't say it again.

23
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:47,360
Your dead men seem
to have moved camp.

24
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:49,929
They were here.

25
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:55,569
See where they went.

26
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,218
What is it?

27
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:45,721
It's...

28
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:21,969

30
00:09:48,161 --> 00:09:51,230
Go on, father's watching.

31
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:55,168
<i>And your mother.</i>

32
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:04,546
Fine work as always.
Well done.

33
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,415
Thank you.

34
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:10,418
I love the detail that you've managed
to get in these corners.

35
00:10:10,453 --> 00:10:12,387
<i>Quite beautiful.</i>

36
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:14,455
The stitching...

37
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:38,282
And which one of you
was a marksman at 10?

38
00:10:39,251 --> 00:10:40,818
Keep practicing, Bran.

39
00:10:42,888 --> 00:10:44,922
Go on.

40
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:47,825
Don't think
too much, Bran.

41
00:10:49,294 --> 00:10:51,361
Relax your bow arm.

42
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:05,974
Quick, Bran!
Faster.

43
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:09,545
Lord Stark!

44
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,581
My lady.

45
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,784
A guardsman just
rode in from the hills.

46
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:18,820
They've captured a deserter
from The Night's Watch.

47
00:11:22,124 --> 00:11:24,493
Get the lads to saddle
their horses.

48
00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:26,561
Do you have to?

49
00:11:26,595 --> 00:11:28,929
He swore an oath, Cat.

50
00:11:28,964 --> 00:11:30,931
The law is law,
my lady.

51
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,934
Tell Bran he's coming too.

52
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,403
Ned.

53
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:39,772
10 is too young
to see such things.

54
00:11:39,806 --> 00:11:41,573
He won't be a boy forever.

55
00:11:43,476 --> 00:11:45,810
And winter is coming.

56
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:07,801
Lad, go run back
and get the rest.

57
00:12:12,374 --> 00:12:14,241
White Walkers.

58
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,010
I saw the White Walkers.

59
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:18,979
White Walkers.

60
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:22,081
The White Walkers,
I saw them.

61
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:32,759
I know I broke my oath.

62
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:35,862
And I know
I'm a deserter.

63
00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:39,599
I should have gone back to the wall
and warned them, but--

64
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,801
I saw what I saw.

65
00:12:41,836 --> 00:12:43,836
I saw the White Walkers.

66
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,574
<i>People need to know.</i>

67
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,578
If you can get word
to my family...

68
00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:54,014
<i>Tell them I'm no coward.</i>

69
00:12:54,048 --> 00:12:56,183
<i>Tell them I'm sorry.</i>

70
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,768
Forgive me, Lord.

71
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,474
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

72
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:23,409
- the first of his name...
- Don't look away.

73
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:25,183
<i>...King of the Andals</i>
<i>and the first men...</i>

74
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:26,322
Father will know if you do.

75
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,882
<i>...Lord of the Seven Kingdoms</i>
<i>and protector of the realm,</i>

76
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:32,652
I, Eddard of the House Stark,

77
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,556
Lord of Winterfell
and warden of the north,

78
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,125
sentence you to die.

79
00:13:52,574 --> 00:13:55,041
You did well.

80
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,170
You understand
why I did it?

81
00:14:24,204 --> 00:14:26,172
Jon said
he was a deserter.

82
00:14:26,206 --> 00:14:28,874
But do you understand
why <i>i</i> had to kill him?

83
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,676
"Our way is the old way"?

84
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:34,246
The man who passes
the sentence

85
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,014
should swing the sword.

86
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,418
Is it true he saw
the White Walkers?

87
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,290
The White Walkers have been
gone for thousands of years.

88
00:14:44,324 --> 00:14:47,127
So he was lying?

89
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:53,868
A madman sees what he sees.

90
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,796
What is it?

91
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:26,234
Mountain lion?

92
00:15:27,536 --> 00:15:29,538
There are no Mountain lions
in these woods.

93
00:16:15,522 --> 00:16:17,523
It's a freak!

94
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:21,160
It's a direwolf.

95
00:16:29,003 --> 00:16:31,737
Tough old beast.

96
00:16:33,173 --> 00:16:35,941
There are no direwolves
south of the wall.

97
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:38,109
Now there are five.

98
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:40,812
You want to hold it?

99
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:47,518
Where will they go?

100
00:16:47,553 --> 00:16:49,354
Their mother's dead.

101
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:51,023
They don't belong
down here.

102
00:16:51,057 --> 00:16:52,991
Better
a quick death.

103
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:54,893
They won't last
without their mother.

104
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:57,095
- Right. Give it here.
- No!

105
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,863
Put away your blade.

106
00:16:58,897 --> 00:17:01,032
I take orders
from your father, not you.

107
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:03,868
- Please, father!
- I'm sorry, Bran.

108
00:17:03,903 --> 00:17:05,771
Lord Stark?

109
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:08,273
There are
five pups...

110
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:11,609
one for each
of the Stark children.

111
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:14,446
The direwolf is the sigil of your House.

112
00:17:15,814 --> 00:17:18,016
They were meant
to have them.

113
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:25,390
You will train them
yourselves.

114
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:27,392
You will
feed them yourselves.

115
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:30,462
And if they die,
you will bury them yourselves.

116
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,805
What about you?

117
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:43,308
I'm not a Stark.

118
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:45,543
Get on.

119
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,022
What is it?

120
00:18:00,826 --> 00:18:04,796
The runt of the litter--
that one's yours, snow.

121
00:19:04,654 --> 00:19:08,090
As your brother,
I feel it's my duty to warn you:

122
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,393
You worry too much.

123
00:19:11,428 --> 00:19:14,763
- It's starting to show.
- And you never worry about anything.

124
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:20,036
<i>When we were seven</i>
<i>and you jumped off</i>
<i>the cliffs at Casterly Rock,</i>

125
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,405
100-foot drop into the water,

126
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:24,507
and you were never afraid.

127
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:27,243
There was nothing to be afraid of
until you told father.

128
00:19:27,277 --> 00:19:29,144
"We're lannisters.

129
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:31,646
Lannisters
don't act like fools."

130
00:19:33,316 --> 00:19:35,583
<i>What if Jon Arryn</i>
<i>told someone?</i>

131
00:19:35,618 --> 00:19:37,918
But who would he tell?

132
00:19:37,953 --> 00:19:41,088
- My husband.
- If he told the King, both our heads

133
00:19:41,123 --> 00:19:43,323
would be skewered
on the city gates by now.

134
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:47,862
Whatever Jon Arryn
knew or didn't know, it died with him.

135
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:51,699
And Robert will choose a new
Hand of the King-- someone to do his job

136
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,635
while he's off fucking boars
and hunting whores--

137
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,638
or is it
the other way around?

138
00:19:57,673 --> 00:20:00,074
And life will go on.

139
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:02,677
You should be
The Hand of the King.

140
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:05,546
That's an honor
I can do without.

141
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:07,715
Their days are too long,

142
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:10,017
their lives are too short.

143
00:20:48,324 --> 00:20:49,991
All these years

144
00:20:50,026 --> 00:20:51,693
and I still feel
like an outsider

145
00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:53,962
when I come here.

146
00:20:53,997 --> 00:20:56,532
You have five
northern children.

147
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:59,801
You're not an outsider.

148
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:02,771
I wonder
if the old gods agree.

149
00:21:03,873 --> 00:21:06,775
It's your gods
with all the rules.

150
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,851
I am so sorry, my love.

151
00:21:16,254 --> 00:21:19,790
- Tell me.
- There was a raven from King's Landing.

152
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,361
Jon Arryn is dead.

153
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:26,064
<i>A fever took him.</i>

154
00:21:28,835 --> 00:21:31,136
<i>I know he was like</i>
<i>a father to you.</i>

155
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:37,208
- <i>Your sister, the boy?</i>
- They both have their health,

156
00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:39,410
<i>gods be good.</i>

157
00:21:49,154 --> 00:21:52,056
The raven
brought more news...

158
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:55,393
The King rides
for Winterfell...

159
00:21:55,428 --> 00:21:57,128
with the Queen

160
00:21:57,163 --> 00:21:59,297
<i>and all the rest</i>
<i>of them.</i>

161
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:02,601
If he's coming
this far north...

162
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:06,172
There's only
one thing he's after.

163
00:22:06,206 --> 00:22:09,242
You can always say no, Ned.

164
00:22:17,952 --> 00:22:21,689
We'll need plenty of candles
for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

165
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:23,657
I'm told he reads
all night.

166
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:25,593
I'm told he drinks
all night.

167
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:28,930
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...

168
00:22:28,964 --> 00:22:30,731
Stature?

169
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,435
We've brought up
eight barrels of ale from the cellar.

170
00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:36,004
- Perhaps we'll find out.
- In any case,

171
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:38,707
<i>candles.</i>

172
00:22:42,813 --> 00:22:45,882
Why is your mother so dead set
on us getting pretty for the King?

173
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,751
It's for the Queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.

174
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:50,887
I hear the prince
is a right royal prick.

175
00:22:50,921 --> 00:22:52,955
Think of all those
southern girls he gets to stab

176
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,557
with his right
royal prick.

177
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:58,460
Go on, Tommy,
shear him good.

178
00:22:58,494 --> 00:23:00,963
He's never met a girl he likes better
than his own hair.

179
00:23:37,868 --> 00:23:40,736
Gods, but they grow fast.

180
00:23:43,106 --> 00:23:44,573
Brandon!

181
00:23:44,607 --> 00:23:47,943
I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.

182
00:23:47,977 --> 00:23:51,180
How many times
have I told you no climbing?

183
00:23:51,214 --> 00:23:54,082
But he's coming right now--
down our road.

184
00:24:00,923 --> 00:24:03,491
I want you
to promise me,

185
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:05,293
no more climbing.

186
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,299
I promise.

187
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:16,539
- Do you know what?
- What?

188
00:24:16,573 --> 00:24:18,874
You always look
at your feet before you lie.

189
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:24,914
Run and find your father.
Tell him the King is close.

190
00:25:09,027 --> 00:25:12,730
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?

191
00:25:22,842 --> 00:25:24,476
- Hey hey hey hey.
- Ohh.

192
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,811
What are you doing
with that on?

193
00:25:29,614 --> 00:25:31,750
Go on.

194
00:25:33,052 --> 00:25:34,853
Move!

195
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:58,868
Your Grace.

196
00:27:02,874 --> 00:27:04,975
You've got fat.

197
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:19,689
- Cat!
- Your Grace.

198
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:25,961
Nine years-- why haven't I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?

199
00:27:25,995 --> 00:27:27,896
Guarding the north
for you, your Grace.

200
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:30,700
<i>Winterfell is yours.</i>

201
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:36,173
- Where's the imp?
- Will you shut up?

202
00:27:36,207 --> 00:27:38,909
Who have we here?

203
00:27:38,943 --> 00:27:40,711
You must be Robb.

204
00:27:43,382 --> 00:27:47,018
My, you're
a pretty one.

205
00:27:47,053 --> 00:27:49,020
Your name is?

206
00:27:49,054 --> 00:27:51,622
Arya.

207
00:27:51,657 --> 00:27:54,693
Oh, show us
your muscles.

208
00:27:56,462 --> 00:27:57,963
You'll be a soldier.

209
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:03,369
<i>That's Jaime Lannister,</i>
<i>the Queen's twin brother.</i>

210
00:28:03,403 --> 00:28:05,605
<i>Would you please shut up?</i>

211
00:28:15,048 --> 00:28:17,249
My Queen.

212
00:28:17,284 --> 00:28:18,918
My Queen.

213
00:28:18,953 --> 00:28:21,154
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.

214
00:28:21,188 --> 00:28:23,423
We've been riding
for a month, my love.

215
00:28:23,457 --> 00:28:25,158
Surely the dead can wait.

216
00:28:25,193 --> 00:28:27,160
Ned.

217
00:28:36,336 --> 00:28:38,137
Where's the imp?

218
00:28:41,507 --> 00:28:43,541
Where is our brother?

219
00:28:43,575 --> 00:28:45,776
Go and find
the little beast.

220
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,314
Tell me about
Jon Arryn.

221
00:28:50,348 --> 00:28:52,983
One minute
he was fine and then...

222
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:56,954
Burned right through him,
whatever it was.

223
00:28:58,156 --> 00:29:00,091
I loved that man.

224
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:01,459
We both did.

225
00:29:01,493 --> 00:29:04,729
He never had to teach
you much, but me?

226
00:29:04,763 --> 00:29:05,997
You remember me at 16?

227
00:29:06,031 --> 00:29:07,966
All I wanted to do

228
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,635
was crack skulls
and fuck girls.

229
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:13,571
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.

230
00:29:13,605 --> 00:29:16,941
Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.

231
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,214
I need you, Ned--

232
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:27,152
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.

233
00:29:28,688 --> 00:29:31,556
Lord Eddard Stark,

234
00:29:31,591 --> 00:29:34,192
I would name you
the Hand of the King.

235
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:40,699
I'm not worthy
of the honor.

236
00:29:40,733 --> 00:29:44,470
I'm not trying to honor you.
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

237
00:29:44,504 --> 00:29:48,040
while I eat, drink and whore
my way to an early grave.

238
00:29:48,074 --> 00:29:50,175
Damn it, Ned, stand up.

239
00:29:51,444 --> 00:29:53,613
You helped me win
the iron throne,

240
00:29:53,647 --> 00:29:55,748
now help me
keep the damn thing.

241
00:29:56,783 --> 00:29:58,784
We were meant
to rule together.

242
00:29:58,818 --> 00:30:02,887
If your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.

243
00:30:02,922 --> 00:30:05,290
Well, it's not too late.

244
00:30:06,692 --> 00:30:08,627
I have a son,
you have a daughter.

245
00:30:10,363 --> 00:30:12,197
We'll join our Houses.

246
00:30:36,191 --> 00:30:40,161
-
It is true what they say
about the northern girls.

247
00:30:48,437 --> 00:30:50,638
Did you hear the King's
in Winterfell?

248
00:30:50,672 --> 00:30:52,607
I did hear
something about that.

249
00:30:52,641 --> 00:30:54,908
And the Queen
and her twin brother.

250
00:30:54,943 --> 00:30:58,078
They say that <i>he</i> is the most
handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.

251
00:30:58,112 --> 00:31:00,246
And the other brother?

252
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,316
- The Queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one,

253
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,352
and there's
the clever one.

254
00:31:08,221 --> 00:31:11,257
Mmm, I hear they
call him the imp.

255
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:13,359
I hear he hates
that nickname.

256
00:31:13,393 --> 00:31:16,629
Oh?
I hear he's
more than earned it.

257
00:31:16,664 --> 00:31:19,432
I hear he's a drunken
little lecher,

258
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:21,902
prone to all manner
of perversions.

259
00:31:21,936 --> 00:31:23,837
Clever girl.

260
00:31:25,306 --> 00:31:27,474
We've been expecting you,
Lord Tyrion.

261
00:31:28,776 --> 00:31:30,677
Have you?

262
00:31:30,711 --> 00:31:32,579
- Oh!
- Already?

263
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:37,451
The gods gave me
one blessing.

264
00:31:42,256 --> 00:31:44,858
- Don't get up.
- My Lord.

265
00:31:44,892 --> 00:31:47,227
Should I explain to you
the meaning of a closed door

266
00:31:47,261 --> 00:31:50,998
- in a whorehouse, brother?
- You have much to teach me, no doubt,

267
00:31:51,032 --> 00:31:54,668
but our sister craves
your attention.

268
00:31:54,702 --> 00:31:56,804
She has odd cravings,
our sister.

269
00:31:56,838 --> 00:31:58,972
A family trait.

270
00:31:59,007 --> 00:32:01,875
Now the Starks are
feasting us at sundown.

271
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:04,111
Don't leave me alone
with these people.

272
00:32:04,146 --> 00:32:06,514
<i>I'm sorry, I've begun</i>
<i>the feast a bit early.</i>

273
00:32:06,548 --> 00:32:09,917
And this is the first
of many courses.

274
00:32:09,951 --> 00:32:12,153
I thought
you might say that.

275
00:32:12,187 --> 00:32:14,588
But since
we're short on time...

276
00:32:14,622 --> 00:32:16,523
Come on, girls.

277
00:32:21,595 --> 00:32:23,897
See you at sundown.

278
00:32:23,931 --> 00:32:26,499
<i>Close the door!</i>

279
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:41,649
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?

280
00:32:43,386 --> 00:32:45,687
<i>She should be</i>
<i>on a hill somewhere</i>

281
00:32:45,722 --> 00:32:48,324
with the sun
and the clouds above her.

282
00:32:48,358 --> 00:32:50,326
<i>She was my sister.</i>

283
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,128
This is where
she belongs.

284
00:32:53,163 --> 00:32:55,698
She belonged with me.

285
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:04,340
In my dreams,
I kill him every night.

286
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:08,343
It's done, your Grace.

287
00:33:08,378 --> 00:33:11,013
The Targaryens are gone.

288
00:33:13,016 --> 00:33:15,317
Not all of them.

289
00:33:26,095 --> 00:33:28,196
<i>Daenerys!</i>

290
00:33:31,267 --> 00:33:33,134
Daenerys.

291
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:35,203
There's our bride-to-be.

292
00:33:36,105 --> 00:33:39,240
Look, a gift
from Illyrio.

293
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,076
Touch it.

294
00:33:42,111 --> 00:33:44,312
Go on,
feel the fabric.

295
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:51,118
Mmm.

296
00:33:52,286 --> 00:33:55,089
Isn't he a gracious host?

297
00:33:57,259 --> 00:33:59,294
We've been his guests
for over a year

298
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,296
and he's never
asked us for anything.

299
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,065
Illyrio's no fool.

300
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:05,434
He knows I won't
forget my friends

301
00:34:05,468 --> 00:34:07,503
when I come
into my throne.

302
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,308
You still slouch.

303
00:34:17,946 --> 00:34:20,347
Let them see.

304
00:34:22,984 --> 00:34:25,885
You have
a woman's body now.

305
00:34:43,436 --> 00:34:46,405
I need you to be
perfect today.

306
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:49,708
Can you do that for me?

307
00:34:53,113 --> 00:34:55,815
You don't want to wake
the dragon, do you?

308
00:34:57,252 --> 00:34:58,852
No.

309
00:35:05,794 --> 00:35:08,863
When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,

310
00:35:08,897 --> 00:35:11,131
they will say
it began today.

311
00:35:34,054 --> 00:35:36,523
It's too hot, my lady.

312
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,512
Where is he?

313
00:35:59,546 --> 00:36:02,180
The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.

314
00:36:15,395 --> 00:36:19,566
Athchomar chomakaan, Khal vezhven.

315
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,535
May I present
my honored guests?

316
00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:25,273
<i>Viserys</i>
<i>of House Targaryen,</i>

317
00:36:25,307 --> 00:36:27,008
<i>the third of his name,</i>

318
00:36:27,043 --> 00:36:30,378
<i>the rightful king of the Andals</i>
<i>and the first men,</i>

319
00:36:30,412 --> 00:36:32,146
<i>and his sister</i>

320
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:34,816
<i>Daenerys</i>
<i>of House Targaryen.</i>

321
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,188
Do you see
how long his hair is?

322
00:36:40,223 --> 00:36:42,924
<i>When Dothraki are</i>
<i>defeated in combat,</i>

323
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:46,894
<i>they cut off their braids</i>
<i>so the whole world can</i>
<i>see their shame.</i>

324
00:36:46,928 --> 00:36:50,897
Khal Drogo has
never been defeated.

325
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:53,900
He's a savage, of course,

326
00:36:53,934 --> 00:36:56,269
<i>but one of the finest</i>
<i>killers alive.</i>

327
00:36:57,538 --> 00:36:59,672
And you will be his Queen.

328
00:36:59,706 --> 00:37:02,341
Come forward, my dear.

329
00:37:42,415 --> 00:37:44,083
Where is he going?!

330
00:37:44,117 --> 00:37:46,652
- The ceremony is over.
- But he didn't say anything.

331
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:49,121
- Did he like her?
- Trust me, your Grace,

332
00:37:49,156 --> 00:37:51,657
if he didn't like her,
we'd know.

333
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:56,929
It won't be
long now.

334
00:37:56,963 --> 00:37:58,864
Soon you will cross
the Narrow Sea

335
00:37:58,898 --> 00:38:01,333
and take back
your father's throne.

336
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:04,268
The people
drink secret toasts

337
00:38:04,303 --> 00:38:06,003
to your health.

338
00:38:06,037 --> 00:38:08,372
They cry out
for their true king.

339
00:38:11,977 --> 00:38:13,845
When will they
be married?

340
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:17,416
Soon.
The Dothraki never stay still for long.

341
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,985
Is it true they lie
with their horses?

342
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,089
I wouldn't ask
Khal Drogo.

343
00:38:23,124 --> 00:38:24,991
Do you take me
for a fool?

344
00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:26,860
I take you
for a King.

345
00:38:26,894 --> 00:38:30,097
Kings lack the caution
of common men.

346
00:38:30,131 --> 00:38:32,499
My apologies if
I've given offense.

347
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:34,902
I know how to play
a man like Drogo.

348
00:38:34,936 --> 00:38:37,838
I give him a Queen
and he gives me an army.

349
00:38:37,873 --> 00:38:40,742
I don't want
to be his Queen.

350
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:47,217
I want to go home.

351
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,585
So do I.

352
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,755
I want us both
to go home,

353
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,090
but they took it from us.

354
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,892
So tell me, sweet sister,

355
00:38:56,927 --> 00:38:59,128
how do we go home?

356
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,531
I don't know.

357
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:05,568
We go home with an army.

358
00:39:07,204 --> 00:39:10,406
With Khal Drogo's army.

359
00:39:10,441 --> 00:39:13,443
I would let
his whole tribe fuck you--

360
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:16,680
all 40,000 men
and their horses too

361
00:39:16,714 --> 00:39:18,582
if that's what it took.

362
00:39:35,698 --> 00:39:38,133
Do you think Joffrey
will like me?

363
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,702
What if he thinks
I'm ugly?

364
00:39:40,737 --> 00:39:44,407
Then he is the stupidest prince
that ever lived.

365
00:39:46,743 --> 00:39:49,311
He's so handsome.

366
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:52,047
When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?

367
00:39:52,082 --> 00:39:55,184
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.

368
00:39:55,218 --> 00:39:57,052
Why would he say no?

369
00:39:57,087 --> 00:40:00,356
He'd be the second most powerful man
in the kingdoms.

370
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,958
He'd have to leave home.

371
00:40:02,993 --> 00:40:05,928
He'd have to leave me.

372
00:40:05,962 --> 00:40:08,965
And so would you.

373
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:11,600
You left your home
to come here.

374
00:40:11,635 --> 00:40:14,436
And I'd be Queen someday.

375
00:40:15,505 --> 00:40:17,073
Please make father
say yes!

376
00:40:17,107 --> 00:40:18,974
- Sansa--
- Please please!

377
00:40:19,008 --> 00:40:21,944
It's the only thing
I ever wanted.

378
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:37,927
Fill that up!
Boys, Rodrik, come on.

379
00:40:37,961 --> 00:40:40,229
<i>Come on!</i>

380
00:40:58,715 --> 00:41:01,483
Is he dead yet?

381
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:07,723
Uncle Benjen.

382
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,028
You got bigger.

383
00:41:12,063 --> 00:41:15,966
Rode all day.
Didn't want to leave you
alone with the Lannisters.

384
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,935
Why aren't you
at the feast?

385
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:21,005
Lady Stark thought
it might insult the royal family

386
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,241
to seat a bastard
in their midst.

387
00:41:23,276 --> 00:41:25,978
Well, you're always
welcome on the wall.

388
00:41:26,012 --> 00:41:28,213
No bastard was ever
refused a seat there.

389
00:41:28,248 --> 00:41:29,948
So take me with you
when you go back.

390
00:41:29,983 --> 00:41:32,851
- Jon--
- Father will let me if you ask him.

391
00:41:32,885 --> 00:41:35,086
I know he will.

392
00:41:37,556 --> 00:41:39,790
The wall isn't
going anywhere.

393
00:41:39,825 --> 00:41:41,158
I'm ready

394
00:41:41,192 --> 00:41:42,526
to swear your oath.

395
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,262
You don't understand
what you'd be giving up.

396
00:41:45,296 --> 00:41:47,764
We have no families.

397
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:51,135
- None of us will ever father sons--
- I don't care about that!

398
00:41:52,337 --> 00:41:54,805
You might, if you knew
what it meant.

399
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,345
I'd better get inside,

400
00:42:00,379 --> 00:42:03,048
rescue your father
from his guests.

401
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:08,087
We'll talk later.

402
00:42:15,928 --> 00:42:18,729
<i>Your Uncle's in</i>
<i>The Night's Watch.</i>

403
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,034
What are you doing
back there?

404
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:27,237
Preparing for a night
with your family.

405
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:33,810
I've always wanted
to see the wall.

406
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:35,579
You're Tyrion Lannister,

407
00:42:35,613 --> 00:42:37,214
the Queen's brother?

408
00:42:37,248 --> 00:42:39,449
My greatest
accomplishment.

409
00:42:39,484 --> 00:42:43,253
And you-- you're Ned Stark's
bastard, aren't you?

410
00:42:46,657 --> 00:42:48,892
Did I offend you?
Sorry.

411
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:53,463
You are
the bastard though.

412
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:57,100
<i>Lord Eddard Stark</i>
<i>is my father.</i>

413
00:42:58,469 --> 00:43:00,970
And Lady Stark
is not your mother,

414
00:43:01,004 --> 00:43:03,272
making you the bastard.

415
00:43:05,475 --> 00:43:08,277
Let me give you
some advice, bastard.

416
00:43:09,445 --> 00:43:11,246
Never forget
what you are.

417
00:43:11,281 --> 00:43:13,215
The rest of the world
will not.

418
00:43:13,249 --> 00:43:15,818
Wear it like armor

419
00:43:15,853 --> 00:43:18,388
and it can never
be used to hurt you.

420
00:43:20,024 --> 00:43:23,027
What the hell do you know about
being a bastard?

421
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:27,732
All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes.

422
00:43:49,222 --> 00:43:53,592
You at a feast--
it's like a bear in a trap.

423
00:43:55,428 --> 00:43:57,762
The boy I beheaded--

424
00:43:57,797 --> 00:44:00,365
- did you know him?
- Of course I did.

425
00:44:00,399 --> 00:44:02,501
Just a lad.

426
00:44:02,535 --> 00:44:04,269
And he was tough, Ned,

427
00:44:04,303 --> 00:44:06,071
a true ranger.

428
00:44:06,105 --> 00:44:09,575
Pfft.
He was talking madness.

429
00:44:10,744 --> 00:44:12,979
Said the Walkers
slaughtered his friends.

430
00:44:13,013 --> 00:44:15,581
The two he was with
are still missing.

431
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,419
Hmph.
A wildling ambush.

432
00:44:20,453 --> 00:44:22,087
Maybe.

433
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:25,657
Direwolves
south of the wall,

434
00:44:25,692 --> 00:44:28,193
talk of The Walkers,

435
00:44:28,227 --> 00:44:30,829
and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.

436
00:44:30,863 --> 00:44:34,132
Winter <i>is</i> coming.

437
00:44:35,635 --> 00:44:37,535
Winter is coming.

438
00:44:39,071 --> 00:44:42,006
- Uncle Benjen.
- Robb boy.

439
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,641
- How are you?
- I'm good.

440
00:44:47,346 --> 00:44:49,580
Is this your first time
in the north, your Grace?

441
00:44:49,615 --> 00:44:52,751
Yes.
Lovely country.

442
00:44:56,457 --> 00:44:59,859
I'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.

443
00:45:01,129 --> 00:45:03,230
I remember how scared I was
when Ned brought me

444
00:45:03,264 --> 00:45:05,499
up here
for the first time.

445
00:45:07,635 --> 00:45:09,369
Hello, little dove.

446
00:45:10,571 --> 00:45:12,739
But you are a beauty.

447
00:45:12,773 --> 00:45:14,874
- How old are you?
- 13, your Grace.

448
00:45:14,909 --> 00:45:17,643
You're tall.
Still growing?

449
00:45:17,678 --> 00:45:19,578
I think so, your Grace.

450
00:45:19,613 --> 00:45:21,847
And have you bled yet?

451
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:28,419
No, your Grace.

452
00:45:29,789 --> 00:45:31,957
Your dress,
did you make it?

453
00:45:33,259 --> 00:45:36,595
Such a talent.
You must make something for me.

454
00:45:38,365 --> 00:45:41,467
I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.

455
00:45:41,502 --> 00:45:43,737
I hear the same.

456
00:45:43,771 --> 00:45:45,839
Your daughter will
do well in the capital.

457
00:45:45,873 --> 00:45:49,577
Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden
up here forever.

458
00:46:05,661 --> 00:46:08,964
- Your pardon.
- I hear we might be neighbors soon.

459
00:46:08,998 --> 00:46:10,665
- I hope it's true.
- Yes,

460
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,567
the King has honored me
with his offer.

461
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:14,102
I'm sure we'll have
a tournament

462
00:46:14,137 --> 00:46:16,104
to celebrate your new title--
if you accept.

463
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:18,341
It would be good
to have you on the field.

464
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,543
The competition
has become a bit stale.

465
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:23,313
- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?

466
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:24,848
Getting
a little old for it?

467
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:28,519
I don't fight
in tournaments

468
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:31,054
because when I fight
a man for real

469
00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:33,323
I don't want him to know
what I can do.

470
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,959
Well said.

471
00:46:37,994 --> 00:46:40,929
Arya!

472
00:46:40,963 --> 00:46:43,565
It's not funny!

473
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,334
<i>She always</i>
<i>does this.</i>

474
00:46:46,368 --> 00:46:48,236
<i>This was</i>
<i>my favorite dress.</i>

475
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:51,539
She always does it
and it's not funny!

476
00:46:51,574 --> 00:46:53,508
Time for bed.

477
00:47:04,455 --> 00:47:07,524
I'm a Northman.

478
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:09,960
I belong here with you,
not down south

479
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:12,496
in that rats' nest
they call a capital.

480
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:16,265
I <i>won't</i> let him
take you.

481
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:20,202
The king
takes what he wants.

482
00:47:20,236 --> 00:47:22,804
That's why he's King.

483
00:47:24,273 --> 00:47:27,708
I'll say,
"listen, fat man."

484
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:31,612
"You are not taking
my husband anywhere.

485
00:47:31,646 --> 00:47:34,048
He belongs to me now."

486
00:47:37,753 --> 00:47:39,754
How did he get so fat?

487
00:47:39,788 --> 00:47:42,623
He only stops eating
when it's time for a drink.

488
00:47:45,493 --> 00:47:48,262
<i>It's Maester Luwin,</i>
<i>my Lord.</i>

489
00:47:49,765 --> 00:47:52,167
Send him in.

490
00:47:54,003 --> 00:47:56,171
Pardon, my Lord,
my Lady.

491
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,041
A rider in the night...

492
00:47:59,075 --> 00:48:01,177
from your sister.

493
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:11,521
- Stay.
- This was sent from the Eyrie.

494
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,762
What's she doing
at the Eyrie?

495
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:22,431
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.

496
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,909
What news?

497
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:37,014
<i>She's fled</i>
<i>the capital.</i>

498
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,819
She says Jon Arryn
was murdered.

499
00:48:41,854 --> 00:48:43,822
By the Lannisters.

500
00:48:43,856 --> 00:48:46,625
She says the King
is in danger.

501
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:48,928
She's fresh widowed, Cat.

502
00:48:48,962 --> 00:48:50,963
She doesn't know
what she's saying.

503
00:48:50,997 --> 00:48:53,499
Lysa's head would be
on a spike right now

504
00:48:53,533 --> 00:48:55,701
if the wrong people
had found that letter.

505
00:48:55,735 --> 00:48:58,437
Do you think she would
risk her life--

506
00:48:58,471 --> 00:49:00,105
her son's life--

507
00:49:00,139 --> 00:49:03,609
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?

508
00:49:10,752 --> 00:49:12,652
If this news is true

509
00:49:12,686 --> 00:49:15,689
and the Lannisters
conspire against the throne,

510
00:49:15,723 --> 00:49:19,025
who but you can
protect the King?

511
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,261
They murdered
the last Hand.

512
00:49:21,295 --> 00:49:23,664
Now you want Ned
to take the job?

513
00:49:23,698 --> 00:49:25,532
The King rode
for a month

514
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:27,601
to ask for
Lord Stark's help.

515
00:49:27,635 --> 00:49:30,270
He's the only one
he trusts.

516
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:34,876
You swore the King
an oath, my Lord.

517
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:38,011
He's spent half his life
fighting Robert's wars.

518
00:49:38,046 --> 00:49:40,547
He owes him nothing.

519
00:49:42,383 --> 00:49:45,485
Your father and brother
rode south once

520
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:48,387
on a King's demand.

521
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:52,391
A different time.

522
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:55,894
A different King.

523
00:50:56,857 --> 00:50:58,658
When do I meet
with the Khal?

524
00:50:58,693 --> 00:51:00,560
We need to begin
planning the invasion.

525
00:51:00,595 --> 00:51:03,062
If Khal Drogo has
promised you a crown,

526
00:51:03,096 --> 00:51:05,064
- you shall have it.
- When?

527
00:51:05,098 --> 00:51:07,199
When their omens
favor war.

528
00:51:07,233 --> 00:51:10,502
I piss on Dothraki omens.

529
00:51:10,537 --> 00:51:13,773
I've waited 17 years
to get my throne back.

530
00:52:13,635 --> 00:52:15,102
A Dothraki wedding

531
00:52:15,137 --> 00:52:18,673
without at least three deaths
is considered a dull affair.

532
00:52:31,219 --> 00:52:33,387
<i>Jadi,</i>
<i>zhey jorah andahli!</i>

533
00:52:33,422 --> 00:52:35,289
<i>Khal vezhven.</i>

534
00:52:41,029 --> 00:52:44,064
A small gift,
for the new Khaleesi--

535
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,602
songs and histories
from the Seven Kingdoms.

536
00:52:49,304 --> 00:52:50,704
Thank you, Ser.

537
00:52:52,307 --> 00:52:55,042
Are you from my country?

538
00:52:55,076 --> 00:52:57,244
Ser Jorah Mormont
of Bear Island.

539
00:52:57,279 --> 00:53:00,013
I served your father
for many years.

540
00:53:00,047 --> 00:53:03,149
Gods be good, I hope to always
serve the rightful King.

541
00:53:26,275 --> 00:53:28,877
Dragon's eggs, Daenerys,

542
00:53:28,912 --> 00:53:31,881
from the Shadow Lands
beyond Asshai.

543
00:53:31,915 --> 00:53:34,950
The ages have
turned them to stone,

544
00:53:34,984 --> 00:53:37,086
but they will
always be beautiful.

545
00:53:39,223 --> 00:53:41,525
Thank you, Magister.

546
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:51,795
She's beautiful.

547
00:54:55,867 --> 00:54:58,235
Ser Jorah,
I don't know how to say

548
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:00,104
thank you
in Dothraki.

549
00:55:00,139 --> 00:55:03,074
There is no word
for thank you in Dothraki.

550
00:55:24,162 --> 00:55:26,163
Make him happy.

551
00:56:25,425 --> 00:56:27,626
No.

552
00:56:30,663 --> 00:56:32,831
Do you know
the common tongue?

553
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:39,304
No.

554
00:56:43,176 --> 00:56:45,744
Is "no" the only word
that you know?

555
00:56:46,846 --> 00:56:48,580
<i>No.</i>

556
00:57:16,876 --> 00:57:19,110
Rough night, imp?

557
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,212
If I get through this
without squirting

558
00:57:21,247 --> 00:57:23,648
from one end or the other
it'll be a miracle.

559
00:57:23,682 --> 00:57:26,050
I didn't pick you
for a hunter.

560
00:57:26,084 --> 00:57:29,186
The greatest in the land--
my spear never misses.

561
00:57:30,388 --> 00:57:32,957
It's not hunting
if you pay for it.

562
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:43,367
Are you as good
with a spear as you used to be?

563
00:57:43,401 --> 00:57:45,936
No, but I'm still
better than you.

564
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,874
I know what I'm
putting you through.

565
00:57:50,909 --> 00:57:52,910
Thank you for saying yes.

566
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,780
I only ask you
because I need you.

567
00:57:57,982 --> 00:57:59,883
You're a loyal friend.

568
00:57:59,918 --> 00:58:03,220
You hear me?
A <i>loyal friend.</i>

569
00:58:03,255 --> 00:58:05,055
The last one I've got.

570
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:08,859
- I hope I'll serve you well.
- You will.

571
00:58:10,394 --> 00:58:13,330
And I'll make sure you
don't look so fucking grim all the time.

572
00:58:14,598 --> 00:58:17,034
<i>Come on, boys,</i>
<i>let's go kill some boar!</i>

573
00:58:26,978 --> 00:58:29,146
Come on, you.

574
00:59:43,457 --> 00:59:45,991
Stop!

575
00:59:46,026 --> 00:59:47,893
Stop.

576
00:59:52,699 --> 00:59:54,968
Are you completely mad?

577
00:59:55,002 --> 00:59:57,904
- He saw us.
- It's all right, it's all right.

578
00:59:57,938 --> 00:59:59,806
- It's all right.
- He saw us!

579
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,109
I heard you
the first time.

580
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:08,516
Quite the little climber,
aren't you?

581
01:00:09,652 --> 01:00:12,587
- How old are you, boy?
- 10.

582
01:00:12,621 --> 01:00:14,321
10.

583
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:25,532
The things
I do for love.
