00:10:00,581 --> 00:10:01,360
( Crowd murmuring )

171
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:03,616
Thousands of good men
were butchered.

172
00:10:03,617 --> 00:10:06,155
After the slaughter,
the northmen feasted on

173
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,862
the flesh of the slain.

174
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:09,890
( Crowd gasping, murmuring )

175
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:12,460
Killing you would send
your brother a message.

176
00:10:12,494 --> 00:10:15,997
( Crying )

177
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:18,500
But my mother insists
on keeping you alive.

178
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,302
Stand.

179
00:10:21,905 --> 00:10:23,697
So we'll have to send
your brother

180
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:25,722
a message some other way.

181
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,078
Meryn.

182
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:34,716
Leave her face.

183
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:36,284
I like her pretty.

184
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:40,689
- ( Blow lands )
- ( Sansa gasps )

185
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,347
( Groans )

186
00:10:43,372 --> 00:10:45,674
Meryn, My Lady
is overdressed.

187
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:48,296
Unburden her.

188
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:55,804
If you want Robb Stark
to hear us,

189
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,974
we're going to have
to speak louder.

190
00:10:58,008 --> 00:10:59,242
( Sobbing )

191
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:02,012
Tyrion: <i>What is the meaning</i>
<i>of this?</i>

192
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:12,889
What kind of Knight
beats a helpless girl?

193
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,091
The kind who serves
his King, Imp.

194
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:16,559
Careful, now. We don't want

195
00:11:16,584 --> 00:11:18,394
to get blood all over your
pretty white cloak.

196
00:11:18,395 --> 00:11:21,497
Tyrion: Someone get the girl something
to cover herself with.

197
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:23,732
She is to be your queen.

198
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,600
Have you no regard
for her honor?

199
00:11:25,635 --> 00:11:27,802
- Joffrey: <i>I'm punishing her.</i>
- Tyrion: <i>For what crimes?</i>

200
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:30,105
<i>She did not fight her</i>
<i>brother's battle, you half-wit.</i>

201
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:33,708
You can't talk to me like that.
The king can do as he likes!

202
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:35,610
The Mad King
did as he liked.

203
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:39,081
Has your Uncle Jaime ever told
you what happened to him?

204
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:42,051
No one threatens his Grace
in the presence of the Kingsguard.

205
00:11:42,086 --> 00:11:44,121
I'm not threatening
the King, Ser.

206
00:11:44,155 --> 00:11:45,722
I am educating my nephew.

207
00:11:45,757 --> 00:11:49,093
Bronn, the next time
Ser Meryn speaks, kill him.

208
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:53,464
That was a threat.
See the difference?

209
00:12:09,315 --> 00:12:12,317
<i>( Crowd whispering )</i>

210
00:12:15,188 --> 00:12:18,757
Tyrion: <i>I apologize for</i>
<i>my nephew's behavior.</i>

211
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:20,293
( Crowd murmuring )

212
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:21,723
Tell me the truth.

213
00:12:21,748 --> 00:12:23,748
Do you want an end
to this engagement?

214
00:12:23,764 --> 00:12:27,768
I am loyal to King Joffrey,
my one true love.

215
00:12:30,905 --> 00:12:36,109
Lady Stark, you may
survive us yet.

216
00:12:39,813 --> 00:12:41,547
The little king's
backed up.

217
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:44,950
Clogged from balls
to brains.

218
00:12:44,985 --> 00:12:47,686
You think dipping his wick
will cure what ails him?

219
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:50,689
There's no cure
for being a cunt.

220
00:12:50,723 --> 00:12:52,991
But the boy's at that age.

221
00:12:53,026 --> 00:12:56,728
And he's got nothing to do all
day but pick wings off flies.

222
00:12:56,763 --> 00:12:59,298
Couldn't hurt to get
some of the poison out.

223
00:13:07,007 --> 00:13:09,041
What are you
doing here, dog?

224
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:11,410
Your uncle left
your nameday present

225
00:13:11,445 --> 00:13:13,912
and asked me to see
that you got it.

226
00:13:16,483 --> 00:13:18,484
And?

227
00:13:18,518 --> 00:13:20,619
What is it?

228
00:13:20,653 --> 00:13:23,089
Look inside,
Your Grace.

229
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:31,931
Your Grace.

230
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:34,835
- Happy nameday, Your Grace.
- My nameday has passed.

231
00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:37,671
We won't tell
if you won't.

232
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:42,944
No.

233
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:44,746
Her.

234
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,151
Touch her.

235
00:13:52,556 --> 00:13:57,282
<i>( Women giggle )</i>

236
00:14:02,731 --> 00:14:06,233
( Breathing heavily )

237
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:12,506
Could you hit her?

238
00:14:13,775 --> 00:14:16,344
( Laughs )

239
00:14:25,755 --> 00:14:27,423
My uncle sent you?

240
00:14:27,457 --> 00:14:29,592
Yes, Your Grace.

241
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:30,961
He chose us himself.

242
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,762
Hmm.

243
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:35,866
- <i>( Slapping )</i>
- <i>( Laughing )</i>

244
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:43,841
Use this.

245
00:14:56,421 --> 00:14:58,055
Harder.

246
00:15:00,124 --> 00:15:01,892
<i>( Whimpers )</i>

247
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:06,563
I said harder.

248
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:11,101
He'd want me to get
his money's worth.

249
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,078
( Crying )

250
00:15:23,015 --> 00:15:26,718
( Screaming )

251
00:15:26,752 --> 00:15:29,587
( Whimpering, crying )

252
00:15:53,512 --> 00:15:57,514
Your Grace, too much pain
will spoil the pleasure.

253
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:02,318
<i>( Woman whimpering )</i>
<i>Please, please</i>

254
00:16:06,856 --> 00:16:08,190
please, Your Grace.

255
00:16:10,092 --> 00:16:12,260
Your Grace,
if your uncle finds out--

256
00:16:12,294 --> 00:16:14,129
Oh, I want him
to find out.

257
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:17,432
You will bring her to his
chambers when you're finished

258
00:16:17,466 --> 00:16:19,667
and show him
what you've done.

259
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,871
Or the same thing
will happen to you.

260
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:32,146
Begin.

261
00:16:38,855 --> 00:16:40,456
- <i>( Thuds )</i>
- <i>( Screams )</i>

262
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,891
Harder!

263
00:16:41,925 --> 00:16:44,193
( Horse whinnies )

264
00:16:53,035 --> 00:16:56,638
Well, if it isn't
my favorite whoremonger.

265
00:16:56,673 --> 00:16:59,574
Pray I haven't kept
you waiting long.

266
00:17:01,677 --> 00:17:03,811
Your Grace.

267
00:17:07,149 --> 00:17:10,451
Now you do the Lannisters'
bidding, is that it?

268
00:17:10,485 --> 00:17:13,687
Tell me, was my brother's
body even cold

269
00:17:13,722 --> 00:17:15,889
before you secured
your newest patron?

270
00:17:15,924 --> 00:17:18,292
I'm a practical man.

271
00:17:19,594 --> 00:17:21,595
Just not a loyal one.

272
00:17:21,629 --> 00:17:23,564
<i>And who would you have</i>
<i>me be loyal to?</i>

273
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:25,532
Your brother's corpse?

274
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:27,633
( Chuckles )

275
00:17:27,668 --> 00:17:30,736
I don't like you,
Lord Baelish.

276
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:33,105
I don't like your face.

277
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,542
I don't like the words that come
oozing out of your mouth.

278
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:40,146
I don't want you in my tent
one minute more than necessary.

279
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:43,382
So tell me,
why are you here?

280
00:17:44,384 --> 00:17:46,386
Renly:
<i>You can trust Brienne.</i>

281
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,921
Her loyalty comes
without charge.

282
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:54,126
You still have many friends
at court, Your Grace,

283
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:57,564
many who believe
Ned Stark erred

284
00:17:57,598 --> 00:17:59,733
by not supporting
your claim.

285
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:03,904
Now I understand.

286
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:05,840
You know I have
the numbers.

287
00:18:05,874 --> 00:18:08,643
You know I'm marching
on King's Landing.

288
00:18:08,677 --> 00:18:11,845
When I take the throne,
you hope to retain your position.

289
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:15,282
And your head.

290
00:18:15,316 --> 00:18:18,284
I would give priority
to my head.

291
00:18:18,318 --> 00:18:20,786
<i>I understand that</i>
<i>you don't like me,</i>

292
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:23,155
and while that
saddens me greatly,

293
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:25,824
I did not come here today
seeking your affection.

294
00:18:27,226 --> 00:18:29,360
<i>When you march</i>
<i>on King's Landing,</i>

295
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:32,797
you may find yourself facing
a protracted siege or...

296
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:36,034
open gates.

297
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:55,453
Your Grace.

298
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:58,423
Lord Baelish.

299
00:18:58,457 --> 00:19:01,593
All of these tents
look the same to me.

300
00:19:01,627 --> 00:19:03,962
- Would you be so kind--
- it would be my pleasure.

301
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:06,831
It took me weeks to learn
way around the camp.

302
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:09,901
Twice I walked in on officers
in stages of undress.

303
00:19:09,936 --> 00:19:12,604
And the moment I learn
which tent is mine,

304
00:19:12,638 --> 00:19:14,340
we're on the move again.

305
00:19:14,374 --> 00:19:16,007
Your tent?

306
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:18,177
Not our tent?

307
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:20,579
The King snores, perhaps?

308
00:19:20,614 --> 00:19:23,716
Or simply prefers
solitude?

309
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,620
Pressures of command,
no doubt.

310
00:19:26,654 --> 00:19:29,356
Four kings vying
for the throne.

311
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,758
I am not tutored
in warfare,

312
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:35,462
but basic arithmetic favors the
side with the greater numbers.

313
00:19:35,464 --> 00:19:37,101
If war were arithmetic,

314
00:19:37,126 --> 00:19:39,280
the mathematicians
would rule the world.

315
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:43,604
But I did notice your brother
entering his Grace's tent the just now.

316
00:19:43,638 --> 00:19:45,839
The place of a Kingsguard
is by the King's side.

317
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:47,908
And on the night
of the your wedding,

318
00:19:47,943 --> 00:19:50,678
who was by
the King's side then?

319
00:19:50,712 --> 00:19:52,914
You seem quite interested
in our marriage.

320
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:55,517
Your marriage
is quite interesting...

321
00:19:55,551 --> 00:19:58,654
Not only to me,
but to the realm.

322
00:19:58,688 --> 00:20:01,791
The marriage of a wealthy girl
always breeds interest,

323
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,960
if nothing else.

324
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,895
You've never married,
have you?

325
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:10,300
I've been unlucky
in my affections, sadly.

326
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,736
That is sad.

327
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,537
Though perhaps
it's for the best.

328
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:16,839
The whole notion of marriage
seems to confuse you,

329
00:20:16,874 --> 00:20:19,075
so allow me to explain.

330
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:23,546
My husband is my King,
and my King is my husband.

331
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,116
Here is your tent,
Lord Baelish. Good night.

332
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:37,327
<i>( Hoofbeats )</i>

333
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:50,608
<i>( Horse whinnies )</i>

334
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,751
( Speaking Dothraki )

335
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,509
What do you know
of this place?

336
00:21:24,543 --> 00:21:26,678
Only that the desert
around their walls

337
00:21:26,712 --> 00:21:28,847
is called
the Garden of Nes.

338
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,451
Every time the Qartheen
shut their gates on a traveler,

339
00:21:33,486 --> 00:21:35,720
the garden grows.

340
00:21:43,662 --> 00:21:46,763
- ( Man coughing )
- ( Man #2 groans )

341
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:51,067
- Man #3: Go on!
- Man #4: You, keep moving!

342
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:58,008
<i>( Woman crying )</i>

343
00:21:58,042 --> 00:22:00,711
- <i>( Screams )</i>
- Man: <i>Bring her about!</i>

344
00:22:00,745 --> 00:22:03,714
What kind of fire

345
00:22:03,748 --> 00:22:05,649
Dragon fire.

346
00:22:05,684 --> 00:22:07,418
There's dragons here?

347
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:10,054
No, all the dragons
are dead.

348
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:12,290
What's that smell?

349
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,695
Dead people.

350
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,865
Move.

351
00:22:27,142 --> 00:22:28,976

<i>( Heavy thud )</i>

359

Woman:
<i>He's dead.</i>

360
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:54,434
He was my son.

361
00:22:56,304 --> 00:22:59,706
My sister
was three days ago.

362
00:22:59,741 --> 00:23:02,809
My husband,
the day before that.

363
00:23:03,778 --> 00:23:06,079
They take someone
every day?

364
00:23:08,383 --> 00:23:10,484
Does anyone live?

365
00:23:26,835 --> 00:23:29,770
<i>( Thunder rumbling )</i>

Cersei.

368
00:23:38,445 --> 00:23:40,213
Ilyn Payne.

369
00:23:40,247 --> 00:23:42,148
The Hound.

370
00:23:42,182 --> 00:23:44,550
Joffrey.

371
00:23:44,584 --> 00:23:47,252
Cersei.

372
00:23:47,286 --> 00:23:49,221
Ilyn Payne.

373
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:50,989
The Hound.

374
00:23:51,023 --> 00:23:54,225
Joffrey. Cersei.

375
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,295
Ilyn Payne.
The Hound.

376
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,867
How dare you?

377
00:24:02,902 --> 00:24:04,769
You may have heard
false reports.

378
00:24:04,804 --> 00:24:07,306
- You betrayed Ned.
- <i>Betrayed?</i>

379
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,274
I wanted him to serve
as Protector of the Realm.

380
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:10,843
I begged him
to seize the moment.

381
00:24:10,877 --> 00:24:14,981
I trusted you.
My husband trusted you.

382
00:24:15,015 --> 00:24:18,284
And you repaid our faith
with treachery.

383
00:24:18,318 --> 00:24:19,619
- No, My Lady.
- Get out!

384
00:24:19,653 --> 00:24:21,822
Cat, I've--

385
00:24:21,856 --> 00:24:24,491
I've loved you
since I was a boy.

386
00:24:24,526 --> 00:24:28,429
It seems to me that fate
has given us this chance--

387
00:24:28,464 --> 00:24:31,865
Have you lost your mind?
Get out!

388
00:24:45,144 --> 00:24:47,479
Do you want to see
your girls again?

389
00:24:49,548 --> 00:24:53,318
Sansa, more beautiful
than ever.

390
00:24:53,353 --> 00:24:57,390
And Arya,
just as wild as ever.

391
00:24:57,424 --> 00:24:59,626
You have Arya, too?

392
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,730
Both girls are healthy
and safe...

393
00:25:03,765 --> 00:25:06,767
<i>for now.</i>

394
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:10,604
But you know the Queen
and you know Joffrey.

395
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:13,573
I fear for
their longevity

396
00:25:13,608 --> 00:25:15,809
if they remain
in the capital.

397
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:33,626
<i>( Knife clinks )</i>

398
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:39,065
What do you want?

399
00:25:40,668 --> 00:25:43,738
The Lannisters will trade your
daughters for the Kingslayer.

400
00:25:43,772 --> 00:25:45,339
Of course they will.

401
00:25:45,374 --> 00:25:48,043
Jaime Lannister
for two girls?

402
00:25:48,077 --> 00:25:49,645
Robb will never agree
to those terms.

403
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,981
I'm not bringing
these terms to him.

404
00:25:52,015 --> 00:25:53,882
I'm bringing them
to you.

405
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:56,518
You think I'd keep
secrets from my son?

406
00:25:56,553 --> 00:25:59,455
Robb has surprised them all
with his skills in battle,

407
00:25:59,489 --> 00:26:01,423
but he's not a mother.

408
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:04,292
<i>Consider it, Cat.</i>

409
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:07,062
<i>You may not get</i>
<i>another chance.</i>

410
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:14,002
- I've brought you a gift.
- I don't want your gifts.

411
00:26:14,036 --> 00:26:17,339
A token of Tyrion
Lannister's goodwill.

412
00:26:17,373 --> 00:26:21,510
He wants you to understand
that this exchange of prisoners

413
00:26:21,544 --> 00:26:23,646
is offered in good faith.

414
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,614
Good faith?

415
00:26:29,486 --> 00:26:31,420
What's this?

416
00:27:00,883 --> 00:27:04,052
Your husband was
an honorable man.

417
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:07,790
He should rest beside his family
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

418
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:14,597
- You may not believe--
- get out.

That's him,

The Mountain.

424
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,750
What are you doing?

425
00:28:10,784 --> 00:28:12,919
He told me he stares
at him every day.

426
00:28:12,953 --> 00:28:15,422
That's why he
doesn't get picked.

427
00:28:40,815 --> 00:28:42,683
You.

428
00:28:42,718 --> 00:28:45,453
Man:
<i>Move, boy!</i>

429
00:28:45,488 --> 00:28:47,956

Woman: <i>Please, Polliver.</i>
<i>Some food.</i>

459
00:30:34,263 --> 00:30:36,998

The Mountain.

463
00:31:02,592 --> 00:31:05,661
Lady Stark, I had not thought
to find you in the Stormlands.

464
00:31:05,695 --> 00:31:09,264
I had not thought
to be here, Lord Stannis.

465
00:31:09,298 --> 00:31:12,667
- Can that truly be you?
- Who else might it be?

466
00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:15,437
When I saw your standard,
I couldn't be sure.

467
00:31:15,471 --> 00:31:18,006
- Whose banner is that?
- My own.

468
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:20,609
I suppose if we used
the same one,

469
00:31:20,644 --> 00:31:23,412
the battle would be
terribly confusing.

470
00:31:23,447 --> 00:31:25,648
<i>Why is your stag</i>
<i>on fire?</i>

471
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,518
The King has taken
for his sigil

472
00:31:28,552 --> 00:31:30,554
the fiery heart
of the Lord of Light.

473
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:35,025
Ah, you must be this fire
priestess we hear so much about.

474
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,261
<i>Mm, brother,</i>

475
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:40,564
now I understand why you
found religion in your old age.

476
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,033
Watch yourself, Renly.

477
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:45,103
Renly:
<i>No, no, I'm relieved.</i>

478
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:47,305
I never really believed
you're a fanatic.

479
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,675
Charmless, rigid,
a bore, yes,

480
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,511
but not a godly man.

481
00:31:54,948 --> 00:31:57,249
You should kneel
he's the Lord's chosen,

482
00:31:57,284 --> 00:31:59,619
<i>born amidst salt</i>
<i>and smoke.</i>

483
00:31:59,653 --> 00:32:01,821
Born amidst salt
and smoke?

00:32:01,855 --> 00:32:03,123
Is he a ham?

485
00:32:03,157 --> 00:32:05,092
Stannis: <i>That's twice</i>
<i>I've warned you.</i>

486
00:32:05,126 --> 00:32:07,027
Listen to yourselves.

487
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:10,297
If you were sons of mine, I
would knock your heads together

488
00:32:10,332 --> 00:32:11,999
and lock you in a bedchamber
until you remembered

489
00:32:12,024 --> 00:32:13,634
that you were brothers.

490
00:32:13,635 --> 00:32:16,336
It is strange to find you
beside my brother, Lady Stark.

491
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:19,172
<i>Your husband was a supporter</i>
<i>of my claim.</i>

492
00:32:19,206 --> 00:32:21,241
Lord Eddard's integrity
cost him his head.

493
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:24,310
And you sit beside this pretender
and chastise me.

494
00:32:24,345 --> 00:32:26,012
We share a common enemy.

495
00:32:26,047 --> 00:32:29,749
The Iron Throne
is mine by right.

496
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:33,219
All those that deny that
are my foes.

497
00:32:33,254 --> 00:32:36,489
The whole realm denies it,
from Dorne to the Wall.

498
00:32:36,524 --> 00:32:38,258
Old men deny it
with their death rattle

499
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:41,161
and unborn children deny it
in their mother's wombs.

500
00:32:43,597 --> 00:32:45,398
No one wants you
for their King.

501
00:32:45,432 --> 00:32:48,634
<i>You never wanted</i>
<i>any friends, brother.</i>

502
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:51,103
<i>But a man without friends</i>
<i>is a man without power.</i>

503
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:54,673
For the sake of the mother
who bore us,

504
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:57,076
I will give you this one night
to reconsider.

505
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,712
Strike your banners,

506
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:02,347
come to me before dawn,

507
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:05,283
and I will grant you
your old seat in the council.

508
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:09,253
I'll even name you
my heir

509
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:11,122
until a son
is born to me.

510
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:15,460
Otherwise I shall
destroy you.

511
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:20,899
Look across
those fields, brother.

512
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:23,569
<i>Can you see</i>
<i>all those banners?</i>

513
00:33:23,603 --> 00:33:26,339
You think a few bolts
of cloth will make you King?

514
00:33:26,373 --> 00:33:28,541
No.

515
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,712
The men holding those bolts
of cloth will make me King.

516
00:33:31,746 --> 00:33:33,614
We shall see, Renly.

517
00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:36,384
Come the dawn,
we shall see.

518
00:33:36,418 --> 00:33:38,586
Look to your sins,
Lord Renly.

519
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:41,122
The night is dark
and full of terrors.

520
00:33:46,662 --> 00:33:50,230
Would you believe
I loved him once?

521
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,620
I thought we were welcome.

522
00:34:12,654 --> 00:34:15,523
If you heard a Dothraki horde
was approaching your city,

523
00:34:15,557 --> 00:34:17,591
you might do the same,
Khaleesi.

524
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:21,995
Horde?

525
00:34:36,711 --> 00:34:38,745
My name is Daenerys--

526
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,015
Daenerys Stormborn
of the House Targaryen.

527
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,084
You know me, My Lord?

528
00:34:44,118 --> 00:34:46,754
Only by reputation,
Khaleesi.

529
00:34:46,788 --> 00:34:50,324
And I'm no lord,
merely a humble merchant.

530
00:34:51,427 --> 00:34:54,062
They call you
the Mother of Dragons.

531
00:34:54,096 --> 00:34:56,064
And what should
I call you?

532
00:34:56,098 --> 00:34:57,666
Oh, my name is quite long

533
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,269
and quite impossible
for foreigners to pronounce.

534
00:35:00,303 --> 00:35:03,907
I am simply a trader
of spices.

535
00:35:03,941 --> 00:35:07,277
But we are the Thirteen,

536
00:35:07,312 --> 00:35:10,648
charged with the governance
and protection of Qarth,

537
00:35:10,682 --> 00:35:14,385
the greatest city
that ever was or will be.

538
00:35:15,687 --> 00:35:18,220
The beauty of
Quarth is legendary--

539
00:35:18,245 --> 00:35:20,245
Qarth.

540
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:23,327
Qarth.

541
00:35:23,362 --> 00:35:26,397
Might we see
the dragons?

542
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:34,405
My friend,

543
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,874
we have travelled
very far.

544
00:35:36,908 --> 00:35:39,409
<i>We have no food,</i>
<i>no water.</i>

545
00:35:39,444 --> 00:35:41,911
Once I see my people fed,
I would be honored--

546
00:35:41,946 --> 00:35:44,781
Forgive me,
Mother of Dragons,

547
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:48,818
but no man alive has seen
a living dragon.

548
00:35:48,852 --> 00:35:51,020
Some of my more
skeptical friends

549
00:35:51,054 --> 00:35:54,490
refuse to believe
your children

550
00:35:54,524 --> 00:35:56,425
even exist.

551
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,862
<i>All we ask is the chance</i>
<i>to see for ourselves.</i>

552
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:01,864
I am not a liar.

553
00:36:01,899 --> 00:36:03,933
Oh, I don't think you are.

554
00:36:03,967 --> 00:36:05,668
But as I've never
met you before,

555
00:36:05,702 --> 00:36:08,905
my opinion on the matter
is of limited value.

556
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:12,876
Where I come from,

557
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:15,378
guests are treated
with respect,

558
00:36:15,413 --> 00:36:18,715
not insulted
at the gates.

559
00:36:18,749 --> 00:36:21,250
Then perhaps you should
return to where you come from.

560
00:36:21,285 --> 00:36:23,486
We wish you well.

561
00:36:26,991 --> 00:36:28,892
What are you doing?

562
00:36:28,926 --> 00:36:31,727
You promised
to receive me.

563
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:34,230
We have received you.

564
00:36:34,264 --> 00:36:36,966
Here we are,
and here you are.

565
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,904
If you do not let us in,
all of us will die.

566
00:36:40,938 --> 00:36:43,640
Which we shall
deeply regret.

567
00:36:43,674 --> 00:36:44,745
But Qarth did not become

568
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,890
the greatest city that
ever was or will be

569
00:36:46,911 --> 00:36:50,581
by letting Dothraki savages
through its gates.

570
00:36:57,455 --> 00:36:59,690
Khaleesi, please
be careful.

571
00:37:02,527 --> 00:37:05,129
Thirteen!

572
00:37:05,163 --> 00:37:07,665
When my dragons are grown,

573
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:10,801
we will take back
what was stolen from me

574
00:37:10,836 --> 00:37:13,170
and destroy those
who have wronged me.

575
00:37:13,205 --> 00:37:15,673
We will lay waste
to armies

576
00:37:15,707 --> 00:37:18,408
and burn cities
to the ground.

577
00:37:18,443 --> 00:37:22,412
Turn us away and we will
burn you first.

578
00:37:22,447 --> 00:37:24,614
Ah.

579
00:37:24,649 --> 00:37:27,417
You are a true
Targaryen.

580
00:37:27,452 --> 00:37:30,587
Only, as you said
a moment ago,

581
00:37:30,621 --> 00:37:32,222
if we don't let you
into the city,

582
00:37:32,257 --> 00:37:34,758
you will all die.
And so...

583
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:37,427
Retreating in fear
from a little girl

584
00:37:37,461 --> 00:37:39,629
is unbecoming
of the greatest city

585
00:37:39,663 --> 00:37:41,231
that ever was
or will be.

586
00:37:41,265 --> 00:37:44,802
The discussion is over,
Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

587
00:37:44,836 --> 00:37:46,837
The Thirteen have spoken.

588
00:37:46,872 --> 00:37:49,607
I am one of the Thirteen

589
00:37:49,641 --> 00:37:52,076
and I am still speaking.

590
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,445
The girl threatens to burn
our city to the ground

591
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:57,648
and you would invite her in
for a cup of wine?

592
00:37:57,682 --> 00:37:59,750
She is the Mother
of Dragons.

593
00:37:59,784 --> 00:38:03,086
Do you expect her to watch
her people starve

594
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,221
without breathing fire?

595
00:38:05,256 --> 00:38:07,824
<i>I believe we can allow</i>
<i>a few Dothraki</i>

596
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:10,426
<i>through our gates</i>
<i>without dooming our city.</i>

597
00:38:10,461 --> 00:38:13,764
<i>After all, here I am,</i>

598
00:38:13,798 --> 00:38:15,866
a savage from
the Summer Isles,

599
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,769
and Qarth still stands.

600
00:38:17,836 --> 00:38:20,705
Our decision is final.

601
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,875
Very well.

602
00:38:25,145 --> 00:38:27,747
I invoke <i>Soumai.</i>

603
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:34,252
<i>I will vouch for her,</i>
<i>her people,</i>

604
00:38:34,287 --> 00:38:37,655
<i>and her dragons</i>
<i>in accordance with the law.</i>

605
00:38:43,662 --> 00:38:45,662
Be it on your head.

606
00:38:47,064 --> 00:38:50,032
Welcome to Qarth,
My Lady.

607
00:39:39,549 --> 00:39:41,951
Mountain:
<i>You.</i>

608
00:39:50,395 --> 00:39:52,829
Tickler: Is there gold or silver
in the village?

609
00:39:52,863 --> 00:39:55,765
- I'm not from the village.
- Where is the Brotherhood?

610
00:39:56,734 --> 00:39:58,401
I don't know
what that is.

611
00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:06,910
( Squeaking )

612
00:40:12,182 --> 00:40:14,083
( Horses neigh )

613
00:40:27,499 --> 00:40:31,969
Man: <i>You two, take Lord Lannister's</i>
<i>things to his quarters.</i>

614
00:40:32,004 --> 00:40:33,604
What's this?

615
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,307
We weren't expecting you
till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.

616
00:40:36,341 --> 00:40:38,977
( Chuckles )
Evidently not.

617
00:40:41,013 --> 00:40:42,814
Why are these prisoners
not in their cells?

618
00:40:42,848 --> 00:40:45,217
Mountain: <i>Cells are overflowing,</i>
<i>My Lord.</i>

619
00:40:45,251 --> 00:40:46,852
Polliver:
<i>This lot won't be here long.</i>

620
00:40:46,886 --> 00:40:49,288
<i>Don't need</i>
<i>no permanent place.</i>

621
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,325
After we interrogate 'em,
we usually just...

622
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:56,696
Are we so well-manned
that we can afford to discard

623
00:40:56,731 --> 00:40:59,533
able young bodies
and skilled laborers?

624
00:41:09,078 --> 00:41:11,747
You,
do you have a trade?

625
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:14,583
Gendry:
<i>Smith, My Lord.</i>

626
00:41:16,086 --> 00:41:18,454
What are you looking at?
Kneel!

627
00:41:20,023 --> 00:41:23,292
Kneel or I'll carve
your lungs out, boy.

628
00:41:23,326 --> 00:41:25,627
He'll do no such thing.

629
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:29,364
This one's a girl,
you idiot,

630
00:41:29,398 --> 00:41:30,765
dressed as a boy.

631
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:33,868
- Why?
- Safer to travel, My Lord.

632
00:41:33,902 --> 00:41:36,003
Smart.

633
00:41:36,037 --> 00:41:37,905
More than I can say
for this lot.

634
00:41:37,939 --> 00:41:40,608
Get these prisoners
to work.

635
00:41:40,642 --> 00:41:42,576
Bring the girl.

636
00:41:42,611 --> 00:41:44,678
I need a new
cupbearer.

637
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:46,314
Mountain:
<i>My Lord.</i>

638
00:41:46,348 --> 00:41:48,116
<i>( Knocking on door )</i>

639
00:41:53,723 --> 00:41:55,724
Your visits
are too few, cousin.

640
00:41:55,759 --> 00:41:57,359
Her Grace,
the Queen Regent,

641
00:41:57,393 --> 00:41:59,762
commands you to release
Grand Maester Pycelle.

642
00:41:59,796 --> 00:42:03,132
- Here's your warrant.
- So it is.

643
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:05,535
Will you take
a cup with me?

644
00:42:05,569 --> 00:42:08,038
I find that mulled wine
helps me sleep.

645
00:42:08,105 --> 00:42:10,073
<i>I am here</i>
<i>at her Grace's behest,</i>

646
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:12,275
not to drink
with you, Imp.

647
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:15,178
If my sister was
so concerned for Pycelle,

648
00:42:15,212 --> 00:42:17,413
<i>I would have thought</i>
<i>she'd come herself.</i>

649
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:19,481
Instead she sends you.

650
00:42:19,516 --> 00:42:20,949
What am I to make
of that?

651
00:42:20,984 --> 00:42:23,018
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>what you make of it,</i>

652
00:42:23,052 --> 00:42:25,086
so long as you release
your prisoner immediately.

653
00:42:25,121 --> 00:42:29,224
And you've received these
instructions directly from Cersei?

654
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:31,526
As I said several times.

655
00:42:31,561 --> 00:42:34,463
And you've waited this long
to deliver the information?

656
00:42:34,497 --> 00:42:36,697
When the Queen Regent
gives me a command, I carry

657
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:38,722
it out without delay.

658
00:42:41,105 --> 00:42:43,773
Cersei must have
great trust in you,

659
00:42:43,807 --> 00:42:46,009
<i>allowing you</i>
<i>into her chamber</i>

660
00:42:46,043 --> 00:42:48,912
during the hour
of the wolf.

661
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:55,719
The Queen Regent has a great
many responsibilities.

662
00:42:55,753 --> 00:42:57,354
She often works
from dusk till dawn.

663
00:42:57,388 --> 00:42:59,722
She must be very glad
to have you helping her

664
00:42:59,757 --> 00:43:02,091
from dusk till dawn.

665
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:05,126
Ah, lavender oil.

666
00:43:05,161 --> 00:43:07,696
She always loved lavender oil,
even as a girl.

667
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,364
I am a Knight!

668
00:43:10,232 --> 00:43:12,167
An anointed Knight, yes.

669
00:43:12,201 --> 00:43:14,770
Tell me, did Cersei
have you knighted

670
00:43:14,804 --> 00:43:18,374
before or after she took
you into her bed?

671
00:43:18,408 --> 00:43:21,044
What?
Nothing to say?

672
00:43:21,078 --> 00:43:22,979
No more warnings
for me, Ser?

673
00:43:23,014 --> 00:43:24,948
You will withdraw
these filthy accusations.

674
00:43:24,983 --> 00:43:26,550
Have you ever given
any thought

675
00:43:26,584 --> 00:43:28,485
to what King Joffrey
will have to say

676
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,922
when he finds out you've
been bedding his mother?

677
00:43:35,493 --> 00:43:37,394
It's not my fault!

678
00:43:37,428 --> 00:43:40,096
Did she take you
against your will?

679
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:42,131
Can you not defend
yourself, Knight?

680
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:45,401
Your own father, Lord Tywin,
when I was named the King's squire,

681
00:43:45,436 --> 00:43:47,370
he told me to obey her
in everything.

682
00:43:47,404 --> 00:43:49,271
Did he tell you
to fuck her, too?

683
00:43:49,305 --> 00:43:52,541
I only meant
I did as I was bid.

684
00:43:52,575 --> 00:43:54,343
Hated every
moment of it,

685
00:43:54,378 --> 00:43:56,378
is that what you'll
have me believe?

686
00:43:56,413 --> 00:43:58,448
A high place in court,
a knighthood,

687
00:43:58,482 --> 00:44:00,717
my sister's legs spreading
open for you at night.

688
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:03,086
Oh, yes, it must
have been terrible.

689
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,122
Wait here. His Grace will want
to hear this.

690
00:44:05,156 --> 00:44:07,425
Mercy!
Mercy, My Lord! I beg you.

691
00:44:07,459 --> 00:44:09,060
Save it for Joffrey.
He loves a good grovel.

692
00:44:09,094 --> 00:44:10,815
My Lord, it was
your sister's bidding--

693
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,930
the Queen.

694
00:44:11,931 --> 00:44:13,798
I'll leave the city
at once, I swear.

695
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:17,035
- No, I think not.
- My Lord?

696
00:44:17,069 --> 00:44:19,036
You heard me.

697
00:44:22,507 --> 00:44:24,115
My father told you
to obey my sister.

698
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,576
Obey her.

699
00:44:25,577 --> 00:44:28,946
Stay close to her side.
Keep her trust.

700
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,048
Pleasure her
whenever she requires.

701
00:44:31,082 --> 00:44:33,150
No one ever need know

702
00:44:33,184 --> 00:44:36,620
as long as you keep
faith with me.

703
00:44:37,755 --> 00:44:40,122
I want to know
what Cersei is doing,

704
00:44:40,157 --> 00:44:43,025
where she goes,
who she sees,

705
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:45,460
what they talk of--
everything.

706
00:44:45,495 --> 00:44:47,495
And you will tell me.

707
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:49,898
Yes, My Lord, I will.

708
00:44:49,932 --> 00:44:52,233
I swear it,
as you command.

709
00:44:55,504 --> 00:44:57,805
Oh, rise, rise.

710
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,009
Let us drink to
our understanding.

711
00:45:01,043 --> 00:45:03,578
Oh, you don't have
a cup. Oh, well.

712
00:45:03,613 --> 00:45:06,682
Smile, cousin. My sister
is a beautiful woman.

713
00:45:06,716 --> 00:45:08,350
And it's all for
the good of the realm.

714
00:45:08,384 --> 00:45:10,986
Go back and tell her
that I beg her forgiveness,

715
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,088
that I want no more
conflict between us

716
00:45:13,122 --> 00:45:14,866
and that henceforth

717
00:45:14,891 --> 00:45:16,859
I shall do nothing
without her consent.

718
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,160
But her demands.

719
00:45:18,194 --> 00:45:20,829
Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.

720
00:45:20,864 --> 00:45:23,098
- You will?
- Yes, I'll release him in the morning.

721
00:45:23,133 --> 00:45:25,067
<i>Cersei can keep him</i>
<i>as a pet if she wants,</i>

722
00:45:25,101 --> 00:45:27,102
<i>but I will not have him</i>
<i>on the council.</i>

723
00:45:27,137 --> 00:45:29,972
I could swear that I had not
harmed a single hair on his head,

724
00:45:30,006 --> 00:45:33,509
but that would not,
strictly speaking, be true.

725
00:45:39,483 --> 00:45:42,451
<i>( Wood creaking )</i>

726
00:45:42,486 --> 00:45:44,086
<i>( Waves crashing )</i>

727
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:47,789
Man: <i>Stay within</i>
<i>one table length.</i>

728
00:45:52,462 --> 00:45:54,763
Your Grace.

729
00:45:59,302 --> 00:46:01,636
Do your knucklebones
bring you luck?

730
00:46:04,506 --> 00:46:07,541
Well, life's been good since you
hacked them off, Your Grace.

731
00:46:07,576 --> 00:46:09,977
And it's four less
fingernails to clean.

732
00:46:10,012 --> 00:46:12,546
- Fewer.
- Pardon?

733
00:46:13,548 --> 00:46:15,516
Four fewer
fingernails to clean.

734
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:18,886
Never understood
why you had to wear them.

735
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,889
It reminds me of where I
come from and where I am now.

736
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:24,960
It reminds me
of your justice.

737
00:46:24,994 --> 00:46:26,495
It was an honest
punishment

738
00:46:26,529 --> 00:46:28,064
and you were good
with the cleaver.

739
00:46:28,098 --> 00:46:30,766
You were a hero
and a smuggler.

740
00:46:30,801 --> 00:46:34,236
A good act does not
wash out the bad,

741
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:37,138
nor a bad the good.

742
00:46:37,173 --> 00:46:39,641
A lesson I've tried
to teach my son.

743
00:46:39,675 --> 00:46:41,776
- Does he listen?
- To me?

744
00:46:41,811 --> 00:46:44,479
Gods, no.

745
00:46:44,513 --> 00:46:47,281
But if your red woman told him
to leap from the crow's nest--

746
00:46:47,316 --> 00:46:49,617
She has a name.

747
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,022
I trust you've not forgotten
your smuggler's tricks.

748
00:46:57,326 --> 00:46:59,361
I've lived within
the law for 17--

749
00:46:59,395 --> 00:47:01,796
I want you to be
a smuggler this time.

750
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:04,399
Any shore, any night.

751
00:47:04,434 --> 00:47:06,168
What am I bringing
ashore?

752
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:08,037
The red woman.

753
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,908
No one must know
what you do

754
00:47:11,942 --> 00:47:13,543
and we'll not speak
of this again.

755
00:47:13,578 --> 00:47:17,113
I am true to Your Grace
and always will be,

756
00:47:17,148 --> 00:47:20,116
but surely there are
other ways, cleaner ways.

757
00:47:20,151 --> 00:47:22,585
Cleaner ways
don't win wars.

758
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,287
Are you afraid,
onion knight?

759
00:47:57,524 --> 00:47:58,773
Someone once told me

760
00:47:58,798 --> 00:48:01,196
the night is dark and
full of terrors.

761
00:48:02,895 --> 00:48:05,597
You've carried more
unpleasant cargo in your time.

762
00:48:09,501 --> 00:48:12,437
Are you a good man,
Ser Davos Seaworth?

763
00:48:12,471 --> 00:48:14,431
I'd say my parts
are mixed, My Lady--

764
00:48:15,256 --> 00:48:16,341
good and bad.

765
00:48:16,342 --> 00:48:18,844
If half an onion
is black with rot,

766
00:48:18,878 --> 00:48:20,779
it's a rotten onion.

767
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:23,516
A man is good
or he is evil.

768
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:25,417
- And which are you?
- <i>Oh, good.</i>

769
00:48:25,452 --> 00:48:28,754
I'm a Knight myself
of sorts,

770
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:31,624
a champion of light
and life.

771
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:34,827
Well, that must be
very nice for you.

772
00:48:51,081 --> 00:48:55,217
- Do you love your wife?
- I do.

773
00:48:55,252 --> 00:48:57,553
Yet you have known
other women.

774
00:48:57,587 --> 00:48:59,421
Don't talk about my wife.

775
00:48:59,455 --> 00:49:03,425
I'm not. I'm talking about
other women.

776
00:49:03,459 --> 00:49:05,827
Like me, Ser Davos.

777
00:49:10,099 --> 00:49:12,000
You want me.

778
00:49:12,035 --> 00:49:15,003
You want to see
what's beneath this robe.

779
00:49:16,606 --> 00:49:18,807
And you will.

780
00:49:23,347 --> 00:49:26,383
Strange that
this Lord of Light

781
00:49:26,417 --> 00:49:29,286
asks you to work
in the shadows.

782
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,589
Shadows cannot live
in the dark, Ser Davos.

783
00:49:32,624 --> 00:49:35,125
They are servants
of light,

784
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:37,594
the children of fire.

785
00:49:37,628 --> 00:49:41,064
And the brighter the flame,
the darker they are.

786
00:49:41,098 --> 00:49:43,933
These weren't here before.
They've barred the passage.

787
00:49:43,968 --> 00:49:45,401
( Chuckles )

788
00:49:45,436 --> 00:49:47,703
They can't bar
our passage.

789
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,644
Gods protect us.

790
00:49:54,678 --> 00:49:58,181
There's only one God,
Ser Davos,

791
00:49:58,215 --> 00:50:00,917
and he only protects
those who serve him.

792
00:50:00,952 --> 00:50:02,986

793
00:50:09,662 --> 00:50:12,964

795
