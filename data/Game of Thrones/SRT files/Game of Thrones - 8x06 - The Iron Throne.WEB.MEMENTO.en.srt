1
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:07,105
Cersei's followers will abandon her

2
00:00:07,188 --> 00:00:08,480
if they know the war is lost.

3
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:09,897
Give them that chance.

4
00:00:11,105 --> 00:00:12,271
If the city surrenders,

5
00:00:12,355 --> 00:00:14,021
they will ring the bells
and raise the gates.

6

7
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,063
I'll find you later.

8
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:54,814
It's not safe.

9
00:04:58,271 --> 00:04:59,980
Let me send some men with you.

10
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,313
I'm going alone.

11
00:05:51,188 --> 00:05:53,230
In the name of the one true queen,

12
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:54,605
Daenerys Targaryen,

13
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,397
I sentence you to die.

14
00:05:58,397 --> 00:05:59,730
Grey Worm!

15
00:06:06,772 --> 00:06:08,480
It's over.

16
00:06:08,563 --> 00:06:09,939
These men are prisoners.

17
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:12,647
It is not over until the queen's
enemies are defeated.

18
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,897
How much more defeated
do you want them to be?

19
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,063
- They're on their knees.
- They are breathing.

20
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,188
Look around you, friend. We won.

21
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:22,605
I obey my queen's commands, not yours.

22
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,980
And what are the queen's commands?

23
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:29,438
"Kill all who follow
Cersei Lannister."

24
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:31,730
These are free men.

25
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:34,772
They chose to fight for her.

26
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,939
Easy, men. Easy! Easy.

27
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:50,855
Jon.

28
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:55,772
We should speak with the queen.

29
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,271
Hyah!

30
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:28,021
Torgo Nudho.

31
00:18:09,939 --> 00:18:11,772
You freed your brother.

32
00:18:13,188 --> 00:18:14,939
You committed treason.

33
00:18:16,438 --> 00:18:18,772
I freed my brother.

34
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:24,021
And you slaughtered a city.

35
00:20:18,063 --> 00:20:20,063
What are you doing here?

36
00:20:22,772 --> 00:20:25,647
Hey, what happened?

37
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,480
I came to kill Cersei.

38
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:30,605
Your queen got there first.

39
00:20:35,105 --> 00:20:37,146
She's everyone's queen now.

40
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,772
Try telling Sansa.

41
00:20:46,605 --> 00:20:48,271
Wait for me outside the city gates.

42
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:50,105
- I'll come find you.
- Jon.

43
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:53,647
She knows who you are.

44
00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:56,271
Who you really are.

45
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,772
You'll always be a threat to her.

46
00:21:01,313 --> 00:21:03,855
And I know a killer when I see one.

47
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:38,021
Did you bring any wine?

48
00:21:39,271 --> 00:21:40,313
No.

49
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:43,438
Ah...

50
00:21:43,522 --> 00:21:44,480
Well...

51
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,647
thank you for coming to see me.

52
00:21:49,939 --> 00:21:52,980
Our queen doesn't keep prisoners
for long.

53
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,563
I suppose there's
a crude kind of justice.

54
00:21:59,355 --> 00:22:03,230
I betrayed my closest friend
and watched him burn.

55
00:22:03,313 --> 00:22:06,438
Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes:

56
00:22:06,522 --> 00:22:09,021
"See, I told you."

57
00:22:13,689 --> 00:22:15,647
It just occurred to me.

58
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,355
I'm talking to the only man alive

59
00:22:17,438 --> 00:22:19,397
who knows where I'm going.

60
00:22:20,897 --> 00:22:23,188
So is there life after death?

61
00:22:26,522 --> 00:22:28,021
Not that I've seen.

62
00:22:29,271 --> 00:22:31,563
I should be thankful.

63
00:22:31,647 --> 00:22:34,522
Oblivion is the best I could hope for.

64
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,939
I strangled my lover.

65
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:40,271
I shot my own father with a crossbow.

66
00:22:40,355 --> 00:22:41,480
I betrayed my queen.

67
00:22:41,563 --> 00:22:43,063
- You didn't.
- I did.

68
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:45,939
And I'd do it again,

69
00:22:46,021 --> 00:22:48,230
now that I've seen what I've seen.

70
00:22:49,563 --> 00:22:51,563
I chose my fate.

71
00:22:51,647 --> 00:22:54,438
The people of King's Landing did not.

72
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,939
I can't justify what happened.

73
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:01,730
I won't try.

74
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:07,814
- But the war is over now.
- Is it?

75
00:23:10,146 --> 00:23:13,105
When you heard her
talking to her soldiers,

76
00:23:13,188 --> 00:23:16,313
did she sound like someone
who's done fighting?

77
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:27,438
She liberated the people
of Slaver's Bay.

78
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:30,647
She liberated the people
of King's Landing.

79
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,522
And she'll go on liberating

80
00:23:32,605 --> 00:23:35,689
until the people of the world
are free...

81
00:23:35,772 --> 00:23:37,105
and she rules them all.

82
00:23:37,188 --> 00:23:40,522
And you've been by her side,
counseling her.

83
00:23:40,605 --> 00:23:41,980
Until today.

84
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:44,772
Until today.

85
00:23:48,438 --> 00:23:50,355
Varys was right.

86
00:23:50,438 --> 00:23:52,313
I was wrong.

87
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:55,230
It was vanity
to think I could guide her.

88
00:23:55,313 --> 00:23:57,563
Our queen's nature is fire and blood.

89
00:23:57,647 --> 00:24:00,230
You think our house words
are stamped on our bodies

90
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,397
when we're born and that's who we are?

91
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,814
Then I'd be fire and blood too.

92
00:24:06,397 --> 00:24:07,522
She's not her father,

93
00:24:07,605 --> 00:24:09,146
no more than you're Tywin Lannister.

94
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:14,563
My father was an evil man.
My sister was an evil woman.

95
00:24:14,647 --> 00:24:15,939
Pile up all the bodies

96
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,021
of all the people they ever killed,

97
00:24:18,105 --> 00:24:19,563
there still won't be half as many

98
00:24:19,647 --> 00:24:22,397
as our beautiful queen
slaughtered in a single day.

99
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,730
Cersei left her no choice.

100
00:24:23,814 --> 00:24:25,188
The moment the gates fell,

101
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:26,313
the battle was over.

102
00:24:26,397 --> 00:24:28,397
She saw her friend beheaded.

103
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,313
She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.

104
00:24:30,397 --> 00:24:32,230
And she burned down a city for it.

105
00:24:32,313 --> 00:24:34,814
Ah, it's easy to judge
when you're standing

106
00:24:34,897 --> 00:24:36,063
far from the battlefield.

107
00:24:36,146 --> 00:24:37,814
Would you have done it?

108
00:24:39,397 --> 00:24:40,647
What?

109
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:44,814
You've been up there,
on a dragon's back.

110
00:24:44,897 --> 00:24:46,188
You've had that power.

111
00:24:46,271 --> 00:24:48,105
Would you have burned the city down?

112
00:24:52,021 --> 00:24:54,105
I don't know.

113
00:24:54,188 --> 00:24:55,605
Yes, you do.

114
00:24:57,647 --> 00:25:00,689
You won't say because
you don't want to betray her...

115
00:25:02,563 --> 00:25:03,897
but you know.

116
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,438
What's it matter what I'd do?

117
00:25:14,522 --> 00:25:17,689
It matters more than anything.

118
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,730
When she murdered
the slavers of Astapor,

119
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:28,313
I'm sure no one
but the slavers complained.

120
00:25:28,397 --> 00:25:30,271
After all, they were evil men.

121
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,814
When she crucified hundreds
of Meereenese nobles,

122
00:25:35,897 --> 00:25:36,855
who could argue?

123
00:25:36,939 --> 00:25:38,438
They were evil men.

124
00:25:39,689 --> 00:25:43,271
The Dothraki khals she burned alive?

125
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:45,939
They would have done worse to her.

126
00:25:47,397 --> 00:25:51,605
Everywhere she goes, evil men die

127
00:25:51,689 --> 00:25:53,814
and we cheer her for it.

128
00:25:55,188 --> 00:25:56,522
And she grows more powerful

129
00:25:56,605 --> 00:26:00,146
and more sure
that she is good and right.

130
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,855
She believes her destiny

131
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:10,230
is to build a better world
for everyone.

132
00:26:10,313 --> 00:26:11,772
If you believed that...

133
00:26:13,397 --> 00:26:14,605
if you truly believed it,

134
00:26:14,689 --> 00:26:15,855
wouldn't you kill

135
00:26:15,939 --> 00:26:18,689
whoever stood between you and paradise?

136
00:26:50,146 --> 00:26:52,313
I know you love her.

137
00:26:57,563 --> 00:26:59,480
I love her too.

138
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:06,814
Not as successfully as you.

139
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,980
But I believed in her
with all my heart.

140
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,146
Love is more powerful than reason.

141
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:29,897
We all know that.

142
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,689
Look at my brother.

143
00:27:36,772 --> 00:27:39,063
"Love is the death of duty."

144
00:27:44,772 --> 00:27:46,855
You just came up with that?

145
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:55,689
Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.

146
00:28:00,772 --> 00:28:05,271
Sometimes duty is the death of love.

147
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:14,814
You are the shield
that guards the realms of men.

148
00:28:14,897 --> 00:28:17,313
And you've always tried
to do the right thing.

149
00:28:17,397 --> 00:28:19,063
No matter the cost,

150
00:28:20,063 --> 00:28:22,397
you've tried to protect people.

151
00:28:24,563 --> 00:28:27,730
Who is the greatest threat
to the people now?

152
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:37,897
It's a terrible thing I'm asking.

153
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:41,313
It's also the right thing.

154
00:28:43,605 --> 00:28:47,063
Do you think I'm the last man
she'll execute?

155
00:28:49,063 --> 00:28:50,313
Who is more dangerous

156
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:53,772
than the rightful heir
to the Iron Throne?

157
00:29:06,772 --> 00:29:09,605
That's her decision.
She is the queen.

158
00:29:18,355 --> 00:29:20,313
I'm sorry it came to this.

159
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,980
And your sisters?

160
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,855
Do you see them bending the knee?

161
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,230
My sisters will be loyal to the throne.

162
00:29:44,313 --> 00:29:48,063
Why do you think Sansa
told me the truth about you?

163
00:29:48,146 --> 00:29:50,230
Because she doesn't want Dany
to be queen.

164
00:29:50,313 --> 00:29:53,230
- She doesn't get to choose.
- No.

165
00:29:53,313 --> 00:29:54,647
But you do.

166
00:29:56,271 --> 00:29:58,146
And you have to choose now.

167
00:33:58,438 --> 00:34:00,980
When I was a girl,
my brother told me it was made

168
00:34:01,063 --> 00:34:04,563
with 1000 swords
from Aegon's fallen enemies.

169
00:34:07,438 --> 00:34:09,271
What do 1000 swords look like

170
00:34:09,355 --> 00:34:12,105
in the mind of a little girl
who can't count to 20?

171
00:34:13,522 --> 00:34:17,355
I imagined a mountain of swords
too high to climb.

172
00:34:17,438 --> 00:34:18,855
So many fallen enemies,

173
00:34:18,939 --> 00:34:21,146
you could only see
the soles of Aegon's feet.

174
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,397
I saw them executing

175
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,397
Lannister prisoners in the street.

176
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:28,021
They said they were acting
on your orders.

177
00:34:28,105 --> 00:34:31,313
- It was necessary.
- Necessary?

178
00:34:31,397 --> 00:34:33,188
Have you been down there?

179
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:34,522
Have you seen?

180
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:37,355
Children, little children, burned!

181
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:42,772
I tried to make peace with Cersei.

182
00:34:44,105 --> 00:34:47,647
She used their innocence
as a weapon against me.

183
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,522
She thought it would cripple me.

184
00:34:49,605 --> 00:34:51,271
And Tyrion?

185
00:34:54,605 --> 00:34:58,230
He conspired behind my back
with my enemies.

186
00:34:58,313 --> 00:35:01,146
How have you treated people
who've done the same to you,

187
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,772
even when it broke your heart?

188
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,814
Forgive him.

189
00:35:10,146 --> 00:35:11,855
- I can't.
- You can.

190
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,772
You can forgive all of them,

191
00:35:14,855 --> 00:35:17,563
make them see they made a mistake.

192
00:35:17,647 --> 00:35:19,480
Make them understand.

193
00:35:24,146 --> 00:35:26,146
Please, Dany.

194
00:35:29,355 --> 00:35:31,980
We can't hide behind small mercies.

195
00:35:33,313 --> 00:35:35,355
The world we need

196
00:35:35,438 --> 00:35:38,188
won't be built by men
loyal to the world we have.

197
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:42,271
The world we need is a world
of mercy. It has to be.

198
00:35:42,355 --> 00:35:43,897
And it will be.

199
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:51,689
It's not easy to see something
that's never been before.

200
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,021
A good world.

201
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,689
How do you know?

202
00:36:00,563 --> 00:36:02,772
How do you know it'll be good?

203
00:36:02,855 --> 00:36:04,605
Because I know what is good.

204
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,188
And so do you.

205
00:36:07,271 --> 00:36:09,605
- I don't.
- You do.

206
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:12,355
You do. You've always known.

207
00:36:15,188 --> 00:36:17,021
What about everyone else?

208
00:36:18,855 --> 00:36:22,188
All the other people
who think they know what's good.

209
00:36:24,355 --> 00:36:26,522
They don't get to choose.

210
00:36:32,313 --> 00:36:33,480
Be with me.

211
00:36:35,063 --> 00:36:37,188
Build the new world with me.

212
00:36:37,271 --> 00:36:39,647
This is our reason.

213
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,230
It has been from the beginning,

214
00:36:41,313 --> 00:36:44,480
since you were a little boy
with a bastard's name

215
00:36:44,563 --> 00:36:48,063
and I was a little girl
who couldn't count to 20.

216
00:36:48,897 --> 00:36:50,730
We do it together.

217
00:36:52,855 --> 00:36:55,980
We break the wheel together.

218
00:36:58,897 --> 00:37:00,563
You are my queen.

219
00:37:01,939 --> 00:37:04,814
Now, and always.

220
00:44:27,063 --> 00:44:28,522
Where's Jon?

221
00:44:28,605 --> 00:44:31,689
- He is our prisoner.
- So is Lord Tyrion.

222
00:44:31,772 --> 00:44:34,021
They were both to be brought
to this gathering.

223
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:36,814
We will decide what we do
with our prisoners.

224
00:44:36,897 --> 00:44:38,271
This is our city now.

225
00:44:38,355 --> 00:44:40,772
If you look outside the walls
of your city,

226
00:44:40,855 --> 00:44:42,438
you'll find thousands of Northmen

227
00:44:42,522 --> 00:44:45,146
who will explain to you
why harming Jon Snow

228
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:46,897
is not in your interest.

229
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,939
And you will find
thousands of Unsullied

230
00:44:49,021 --> 00:44:50,188
who believe that it is.

231
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,980
Some of you may be quick to forgive.

232
00:44:53,063 --> 00:44:55,146
The Ironborn are not.

233
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:57,146
I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.

234
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:58,980
You swore to follow a tyrant.

235
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:00,855
She freed us from a tyrant.

236
00:45:00,939 --> 00:45:02,397
Cersei is gone because of her,

237
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,814
and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart.

238
00:45:04,897 --> 00:45:07,146
Let the Unsullied give him
what he deserves.

239
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:09,188
Say another word
about killing my brother

240
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:10,563
and I'll cut your throat.

241
00:45:10,647 --> 00:45:12,063
Friends, please.

242
00:45:14,063 --> 00:45:17,271
We've been cutting each other's
throats long enough.

243
00:45:17,355 --> 00:45:20,146
Torgo Nudho.
Am I saying that properly?

244
00:45:23,689 --> 00:45:25,313
If it weren't for you and your men,

245
00:45:25,397 --> 00:45:27,814
we would've lost the war with the dead.

246
00:45:27,897 --> 00:45:30,480
This country owes you
a debt it can never repay,

247
00:45:30,563 --> 00:45:32,188
but let us try.

248
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,313
There is land in the Reach.

249
00:45:34,397 --> 00:45:35,647
Good land.

250
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,271
The people that used to live
there are gone.

251
00:45:38,355 --> 00:45:40,355
Make it your own.
Start your own house

252
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:42,897
with the Unsullied as your bannermen.

253
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,855
We've had enough war.

254
00:45:44,939 --> 00:45:47,188
Thousands of you, thousands of them.

255
00:45:47,271 --> 00:45:49,188
You know how it ends.

256
00:45:49,271 --> 00:45:50,980
We need to find a better way.

257
00:45:51,063 --> 00:45:53,522
We do not need payment.

258
00:45:53,605 --> 00:45:55,105
We need justice.

259
00:45:56,313 --> 00:45:58,105
Jon Snow cannot go free.

260
00:46:01,355 --> 00:46:03,021
It's not for you to decide.

261
00:46:03,105 --> 00:46:04,605
You are not here to speak!

262
00:46:05,855 --> 00:46:08,188
Everyone has heard enough words
from you.

263
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:12,105
You're right.

264
00:46:12,188 --> 00:46:14,814
And no one's any better for it.

265
00:46:16,146 --> 00:46:18,313
But it's not for you to decide.

266
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,230
Jon committed his crime here.

267
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:25,814
His fate is for our king to decide.

268
00:46:25,897 --> 00:46:27,188
Or our queen.

269
00:46:27,271 --> 00:46:29,480
We don't have a king or queen.

270
00:46:30,814 --> 00:46:33,814
You're the most powerful people
in Westeros.

271
00:46:36,188 --> 00:46:37,814
Choose one.

272
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:48,980
Make your choice, then.

273
00:47:11,689 --> 00:47:13,271
My lords and ladies...

274
00:47:16,689 --> 00:47:21,271
I suppose this is the most
important moment of our lives.

275
00:47:21,355 --> 00:47:23,605
What we decide today will reverberate

276
00:47:23,689 --> 00:47:25,397
through the annals of history.

277
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,438
I stand before you

278
00:47:27,522 --> 00:47:30,522
as one of the senior lords
in the country.

279
00:47:31,397 --> 00:47:33,188
A veteran of two wars.

280
00:47:34,355 --> 00:47:35,897
And I like to think my experience

281
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,814
has led to some small skill
in statecraft

282
00:47:39,897 --> 00:47:41,313
- and underst--
- Uncle?

283
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,230
Please sit.

284
00:48:17,188 --> 00:48:19,605
Well, we have to choose someone.

285
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:20,939
Um, ahem...

286
00:48:21,021 --> 00:48:22,814
Why just us?

287
00:48:26,939 --> 00:48:28,105
Um--

288
00:48:29,855 --> 00:48:32,188
We represent all the great houses,

289
00:48:32,271 --> 00:48:33,563
but whomever we choose,

290
00:48:33,647 --> 00:48:36,939
they won't just rule over
lords and ladies.

291
00:48:37,021 --> 00:48:40,355
Maybe the decision about
what's best for everyone

292
00:48:40,438 --> 00:48:41,605
should be left to...

293
00:48:42,772 --> 00:48:45,480
well, everyone.

294
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,897
Maybe we should give the dogs
a vote as well.

295
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,480
I'll ask my horse.

296
00:49:12,647 --> 00:49:15,230
I suppose you want the crown.

297
00:49:15,313 --> 00:49:16,730
Me?

298
00:49:17,313 --> 00:49:18,814
The Imp?

299
00:49:20,438 --> 00:49:22,814
Half the people hate me
for serving Daenerys,

300
00:49:22,897 --> 00:49:25,021
the other half hate me
for betraying her.

301
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:30,480
- Can't think of a worse choice.
- Who, then?

302
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:41,188
I've had nothing to do but think
these past few weeks.

303
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:45,271
About our bloody history.

304
00:49:46,689 --> 00:49:48,897
About the mistakes we've made.

305
00:49:59,855 --> 00:50:02,188
What unites people?

306
00:50:04,563 --> 00:50:06,021
Armies?

307
00:50:07,563 --> 00:50:08,939
Gold?

308
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:13,021
Flags?

309
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:21,355
Stories.

310
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:25,438
There's nothing in the world
more powerful

311
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,730
than a good story.

312
00:50:29,063 --> 00:50:30,730
Nothing can stop it.

313
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,939
No enemy can defeat it.

314
00:50:35,689 --> 00:50:37,313
And who has a better story...

315
00:50:38,605 --> 00:50:40,271
than Bran the Broken?

316
00:50:44,146 --> 00:50:47,397
The boy who fell
from a high tower and lived.

317
00:50:48,897 --> 00:50:52,980
He knew he'd never walk again,
so he learned to fly.

318
00:50:54,146 --> 00:50:56,563
He crossed beyond the Wall,

319
00:50:56,647 --> 00:50:58,146
a crippled boy,

320
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:00,939
and became the Three-Eyed Raven.

321
00:51:03,313 --> 00:51:05,313
He is our memory,

322
00:51:05,397 --> 00:51:08,063
the keeper of all our stories.

323
00:51:08,146 --> 00:51:12,605
The wars, weddings, births,
massacres, famines.

324
00:51:12,689 --> 00:51:14,605
Our triumphs,

325
00:51:14,689 --> 00:51:17,230
mm, our defeats,

326
00:51:17,313 --> 00:51:18,438
our past.

327
00:51:20,313 --> 00:51:23,105
Who better to lead us into the future?

328
00:51:26,105 --> 00:51:29,897
Bran has no interest in ruling
and he can't father children.

329
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,188
Good.

330
00:51:31,271 --> 00:51:33,772
Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid,

331
00:51:33,855 --> 00:51:35,271
as you well know.

332
00:51:36,313 --> 00:51:38,271
His will never torment us.

333
00:51:42,355 --> 00:51:45,647
That is the wheel
our queen wanted to break.

334
00:51:52,814 --> 00:51:55,897
From now on, rulers will not be born.

335
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,814
They will be chosen on this spot

336
00:51:58,897 --> 00:52:01,897
by the lords and ladies of Westeros...

337
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,146
to serve the realm.

338
00:52:12,188 --> 00:52:14,188
I know you don't want it.

339
00:52:15,397 --> 00:52:18,980
I know you don't care about power.

340
00:52:21,063 --> 00:52:25,021
But I ask you now, if we choose you...

341
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:28,063
will you wear the crown?

342
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,814
Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms
to the best of your abilities

343
00:52:32,897 --> 00:52:35,689
from this day until your last day?

344
00:52:41,355 --> 00:52:44,271
Why do you think I came all this way?

345
00:52:50,855 --> 00:52:53,021
To Brandon of House Stark...

346
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,689
I say aye.

347
00:53:07,313 --> 00:53:08,355
Aye.

348
00:53:15,063 --> 00:53:16,063
Aye.

349
00:53:17,355 --> 00:53:18,313
Aye.

350
00:53:21,397 --> 00:53:22,480
Aye.

351
00:53:25,355 --> 00:53:26,313
Aye.

352
00:53:30,939 --> 00:53:32,647
Aye.

353
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:34,313
Aye.

354
00:53:34,397 --> 00:53:35,647
Aye.

355
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:37,772
- Aye.
- Aye.

356
00:53:37,855 --> 00:53:38,814
Aye.

357
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:43,397
I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.

358
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:46,480
Aye.

359
00:53:57,647 --> 00:53:59,939
I love you, little brother.
I always will.

360
00:54:00,021 --> 00:54:01,772
You'll be a good king.

361
00:54:03,021 --> 00:54:05,313
But tens of thousands of Northmen

362
00:54:05,397 --> 00:54:08,188
fell in the Great War
defending all of Westeros.

363
00:54:08,271 --> 00:54:10,271
And those who survived
have seen too much

364
00:54:10,355 --> 00:54:13,271
and fought too hard
ever to kneel again.

365
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:19,480
The North will remain
an independent kingdom,

366
00:54:19,563 --> 00:54:21,605
as it was for thousands of years.

367
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:49,563
All hail Bran the Broken,

368
00:54:49,647 --> 00:54:50,772
First of His Name,

369
00:54:50,855 --> 00:54:54,063
King of the Andals and the First Men,

370
00:54:54,146 --> 00:54:58,855
Lord of the Six Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

371
00:55:01,647 --> 00:55:04,647
All hail Bran the Broken!

372
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,271
Lord Tyrion...

373
00:55:19,689 --> 00:55:21,480
you will be my Hand.

374
00:55:21,563 --> 00:55:23,271
N--

375
00:55:23,355 --> 00:55:26,605
No, Your Grace, I don't want it.

376
00:55:26,689 --> 00:55:28,772
And I don't want to be king.

377
00:55:30,855 --> 00:55:33,146
I don't deserve it.

378
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:36,105
I thought I was wise, but I wasn't.

379
00:55:36,188 --> 00:55:40,271
I thought I knew what was right,
but I didn't.

380
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:44,105
Choose Ser Davos.

381
00:55:44,188 --> 00:55:45,563
Choose anyone else.

382
00:55:45,647 --> 00:55:47,939
- I choose you.
- You cannot.

383
00:55:48,021 --> 00:55:49,772
Yes, I can.

384
00:55:49,855 --> 00:55:52,271
- I'm king.
- This man is a criminal.

385
00:55:52,355 --> 00:55:55,647
- He deserves justice.
- He just got it.

386
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:58,188
He's made many terrible mistakes.

387
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:01,730
He's going to spend the rest
of his life fixing them.

388
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,146
It is not enough.

389
00:56:16,188 --> 00:56:18,980
Giving you to the
Unsullied would start a war.

390
00:56:20,397 --> 00:56:22,563
Letting you walk free
would start a war.

391
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:25,146
So our new king has chosen

392
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:26,980
to send you to the Night's Watch.

393
00:56:29,063 --> 00:56:30,647
There's still a Night's Watch?

394
00:56:32,897 --> 00:56:34,480
The world will always need a home

395
00:56:34,563 --> 00:56:35,980
for bastards and broken men.

396
00:56:41,063 --> 00:56:43,188
You shall take no wife,

397
00:56:43,271 --> 00:56:45,355
hold no lands,

398
00:56:45,438 --> 00:56:46,980
father no children.

399
00:56:50,105 --> 00:56:52,939
The Unsullied wanted your head
of course,

400
00:56:53,021 --> 00:56:56,355
but Grey Worm has accepted
the justice of a life sentence.

401
00:56:58,021 --> 00:57:01,188
Sansa and Arya wanted you freed,

402
00:57:01,271 --> 00:57:05,271
but they understand our new king
needs to make peace.

403
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:06,814
No one is very happy.

404
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,855
Which means it's a good compromise,

405
00:57:09,939 --> 00:57:10,855
I suppose.

406
00:57:12,814 --> 00:57:14,522
Was it right?

407
00:57:17,605 --> 00:57:19,105
What I did?

408
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,730
What we did.

409
00:57:27,397 --> 00:57:29,355
It doesn't feel right.

410
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:38,480
Ask me again in 10 years.

411
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:04,438
I don't expect
we'll ever see each other again.

412
00:58:08,438 --> 00:58:09,855
I wouldn't be so sure.

413
00:58:11,105 --> 00:58:12,605
A few years as Hand of the King

414
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:15,689
would make anyone want to
piss off the edge of the world.

415
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,146
I wish there had been another way.

416
01:00:38,647 --> 01:00:40,146
Can you forgive me?

417
01:00:52,397 --> 01:00:54,897
The North is free, thanks to you.

418
01:00:56,939 --> 01:00:59,063
But they lost their king.

419
01:01:00,355 --> 01:01:03,188
Ned Stark's daughter
will speak for them.

420
01:01:05,271 --> 01:01:07,689
She's the best they could ask for.

421
01:01:27,647 --> 01:01:30,689
You can come see me, you know,
at Castle Black.

422
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:33,480
I can't.

423
01:01:33,563 --> 01:01:37,146
You think anyone will dare
tell you women aren't allowed?

424
01:01:42,855 --> 01:01:44,313
I'm not going back north.

425
01:01:46,355 --> 01:01:47,814
Where are you going?

426
01:01:49,897 --> 01:01:52,063
What's west of Westeros?

427
01:01:54,522 --> 01:01:56,021
I don't know.

428
01:01:56,105 --> 01:01:57,397
No one knows.

429
01:01:58,605 --> 01:02:00,814
It's where all the maps stop.

430
01:02:02,897 --> 01:02:04,605
That's where I'm going.

431
01:02:13,522 --> 01:02:14,772
You have your Needle?

432
01:02:16,105 --> 01:02:17,105
Right here.

433
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:40,855
Your Grace.

434
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:52,438
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you needed me.

435
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,397
You were exactly where
you were supposed to be.

436
01:07:11,063 --> 01:07:12,730
That's not-- Uh--

437
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:19,313
What's this?

438
01:07:19,397 --> 01:07:21,980
A Song of Ice and Fire.

439
01:07:22,063 --> 01:07:23,980
Archmaester Ebrose's history
of the wars

440
01:07:24,063 --> 01:07:26,313
following the death of King Robert.

441
01:07:26,397 --> 01:07:28,605
I helped him with the title.

442
01:07:31,355 --> 01:07:34,021
I suppose I come in
for some heavy criticism.

443
01:07:34,105 --> 01:07:36,480
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

444
01:07:36,563 --> 01:07:39,271
Oh, he's kind to me.
Never would've guessed.

445
01:07:43,522 --> 01:07:44,980
He's not kind?

446
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:47,438
- He...
- He what?

447
01:07:48,563 --> 01:07:50,647
What does he say about me?

448
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:59,605
I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem.

449
01:08:21,188 --> 01:08:22,355
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

450
01:08:22,438 --> 01:08:23,647
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

451
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,563
We appear to be missing
a Master of Whisperers.

452
01:08:45,647 --> 01:08:47,230
And a Master of Laws.

453
01:08:47,313 --> 01:08:49,647
- And a Master of War.
- Yes, Your Grace.

454
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:51,689
Suitable prospects
will be brought to you

455
01:08:51,772 --> 01:08:53,689
for an audience in the coming weeks.

456
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:57,522
And Drogon? Any word?

457
01:08:57,605 --> 01:08:59,563
He was last spotted flying east,
toward--

458
01:08:59,647 --> 01:09:01,355
The farther away, the better.

459
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:04,355
Perhaps I can find him.

460
01:09:05,522 --> 01:09:07,021
Do carry on with the rest.

461
01:09:08,188 --> 01:09:10,063
As you wish, Your Grace.

462
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:13,730
Ser Podrick.

463
01:09:22,355 --> 01:09:25,021
We serve at your pleasure,
King Bran the Broken,

464
01:09:25,105 --> 01:09:28,689
ruler of the Six Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

465
01:09:28,772 --> 01:09:30,855
- Long may he reign.
- Long may he reign.

466
01:09:30,939 --> 01:09:32,897
- Long may he reign.
- Long may he reign.

467
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:34,355
Long may he reign.

468
01:09:35,855 --> 01:09:37,021
That will improve.

469
01:09:38,188 --> 01:09:39,522
I'm sure it will.

470
01:09:47,021 --> 01:09:49,230
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,

471
01:09:49,313 --> 01:09:50,438
Lord of Highgarden,

472
01:09:50,522 --> 01:09:52,146
Lord Paramount of the Reach

473
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,647
and Master of Coin,

474
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:57,313
would you say the crown's debt
to you has been paid?

475
01:09:57,397 --> 01:09:59,188
In full, my lord Hand.

476
01:09:59,271 --> 01:10:00,313
Good.

477
01:10:00,397 --> 01:10:02,647
Time to start incurring a new one.

478
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:04,105
We have hungry people to feed.

479
01:10:04,188 --> 01:10:05,980
Can we expect some assistance
in this regard?

480
01:10:06,063 --> 01:10:07,647
Indeed we can.

481
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:11,271
Lord Davos, we have an armada
to rebuild and ports to repair.

482
01:10:11,355 --> 01:10:13,438
We have. These projects
will begin as soon as

483
01:10:13,522 --> 01:10:16,814
the Master of Coin and Lord of
Lofty Titles provides funding.

484
01:10:16,897 --> 01:10:20,146
The Master of Coin looks forward
to helping the Master of Ships,

485
01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:22,939
but first he has to ensure
we're not wasting coin,

486
01:10:23,021 --> 01:10:24,855
or soon there won't be no more coin.

487
01:10:24,939 --> 01:10:26,105
"Any more."

488
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:27,647
You Master of Grammar now too?

489
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:29,522
Grandmaester, ahem,

490
01:10:29,605 --> 01:10:31,814
it is my theory,
based on my years of work

491
01:10:31,897 --> 01:10:33,146
on the Casterly Rock sewers,

492
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,271
that clean water
leads to a healthier population.

493
01:10:35,355 --> 01:10:38,105
The Archmaester has done
some research on this subject

494
01:10:38,188 --> 01:10:39,230
and it turns out--

495
01:10:39,313 --> 01:10:41,563
The strong live and the weak don't.

496
01:10:41,647 --> 01:10:43,563
Find the best builders
and set them to the task.

497
01:10:43,647 --> 01:10:47,146
Oh, speaking of builders,
all the best brothels burned down.

498
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:49,980
The Master of Coin is willing
to fund reconstruction.

499
01:10:50,063 --> 01:10:53,021
Uh... the Archmaester
is less than enthusiastic

500
01:10:53,105 --> 01:10:55,355
about the salutary effects of brothels.

501
01:10:55,438 --> 01:10:57,897
Well, I imagine he
isn't using them properly.

502
01:10:57,980 --> 01:11:00,146
I think we can all agree that ships

503
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:01,772
take precedence over brothels.

504
01:11:01,855 --> 01:11:04,522
I think that's a
very presumptuous statement.

505
01:11:05,939 --> 01:11:07,480
I once brought a jackass

506
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:09,814
and a honeycomb into a brothel.

507
01:15:29,313 --> 01:15:31,146
The Queen in the North!

508
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:33,146
The Queen in the North!

509
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:34,939
The Queen in the North!

510
01:15:35,021 --> 01:15:36,605
The Queen in the North!

511
01:15:36,689 --> 01:15:38,105
The Queen in the North!

512
01:15:38,188 --> 01:15:39,897
The Queen in the North!

513
