1
00:00:00,754 --> 00:00:01,691
Tell them all to stop.

2
00:00:01,716 --> 00:00:02,700
For how long?

3
00:00:02,701 --> 00:00:04,669
Until I command them
otherwise.

4
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:06,205
You're learning
to talk like a Queen.

5
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:08,942
Not a Queen.
A Khaleesi.

6
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:13,414
Lord Snow here
grew up in a castle

7
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:15,783
spitting down
on the likes of you.

8
00:00:15,817 --> 00:00:17,818
Everybody knew
what this place was,

9
00:00:17,853 --> 00:00:20,454
but no one told me--
no one but you.

10
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:22,489
The Khaleesi
have baby inside her.

11
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:24,859
It is true.
Her belly start to swell.

12
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:27,429
I need to ride to Qohor.

13
00:00:27,463 --> 00:00:29,198
What did Aaerys Targaryen say

14
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:31,535
when you stabbed him
in the back?

15
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:34,005
He said the same thing
he'd been saying for hours--

16
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,540
"burn them all."

17
00:00:35,574 --> 00:00:37,942
My brother instructs us
to stage a tournament

18
00:00:37,976 --> 00:00:40,978
in honor of Lord Stark's appointment
as Hand of the King.

19
00:00:41,012 --> 00:00:43,549
This tournament is an extravagance
we cannot afford.

20
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:46,052
I'm leaving this morning.
My job is out there.

21
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,389
- I won't let you down.
- You're not going.

22
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:51,893
Here, a man gets what he earns
when he earns it.

23
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:55,731
I don't take orders
from savages or their sluts.

24
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,669
I don't want my brother harmed.

25
00:01:00,704 --> 00:01:03,739
Mormont, kill these
Dothraki dogs!

26
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:08,210
We've come to a dangerous place.
We must protect ourselves.

27
00:01:09,713 --> 00:01:10,746
Ah!

28
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,414
We allow the Northerners
too much power.

29
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:14,416
A good King knows
when to save his strength

30
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,518
and when to destroy
his enemies.

31
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:18,787
So you agree...
The Starks are enemies?

32
00:01:18,821 --> 00:01:22,324
Everyone who isn't us
is an enemy.

33
00:01:22,358 --> 00:01:25,262
- Do you know whose dagger this is?
- Littlefinger: <i>I do.</i>

34
00:01:25,296 --> 00:01:27,631
Tyrion Lannister's...

35
00:01:27,665 --> 00:01:30,000
<i>The imp.</i>

<i>The little lord's</i>

39
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:23,530
- We have visitors.
- I don't want to see anyone.

40
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:26,567
Really?
If I was cooped up all day

41
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:29,670
with no one but this old bat
for company, I'd go mad.

42
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:33,274
Anyway, you don't have a choice.
Robb's waiting.

43
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:36,310
- I don't want to go.
- Neither do I.

44
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:38,246
But Robb's
Lord of Winterfell,

45
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,416
which means I do what he says,
and you do what I say.

46
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:45,153
Hodor!

47
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,192
- Hodor?
- Help Bran down the hall.

48
00:04:51,227 --> 00:04:53,328
<i>Hodor.</i>

49
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:02,972
I must say I received a slightly
warmer welcome on my last visit.

50
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:05,508
Any man of The Night's Watch
is welcome at Winterfell.

51
00:05:05,543 --> 00:05:08,745
Any man of The Night's Watch,
but not I, eh, boy?

52
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,714
I'm not your boy,
Lannister.

53
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:12,717
I'm Lord of Winterfell
while my father is away.

54
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:16,254
Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.

55
00:05:18,324 --> 00:05:20,192
So it's true.

56
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:24,295
Hello, Bran.

57
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,664
Do you remember anything
about what happened?

58
00:05:26,698 --> 00:05:29,300
He has no memory
of that day.

59
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:31,768
- Curious.
- Why are you here

60
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:35,971
would your charming companion
be so kind as to kneel?

61
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:39,741
- My neck is beginning to hurt.
- Kneel, Hodor.

62
00:05:42,445 --> 00:05:44,980
- Do you like to ride, Bran?
- Yes.

63
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:47,416
Well, I mean
I <i>did</i> like to.

64
00:05:47,451 --> 00:05:49,686
- The boy has lost the use of his legs.
- What of it?

65
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,988
With the right horse and saddle,
even a cripple can ride.

66
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:55,059
- I'm not a cripple.
- Then I'm not a dwarf.

67
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:57,128
My father will
rejoice to hear it.

68
00:05:57,162 --> 00:05:59,764
I have a gift
for you.

69
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:02,334
Give that to your saddler.
He'll provide the rest.

70
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:06,938
You must shape
the horse to the rider.

71
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:09,040
<i>Start with a yearling</i>
<i>and teach it to respond</i>

72
00:06:09,074 --> 00:06:11,008
<i>to the reins</i>
<i>and to the boy's voice.</i>

73
00:06:12,277 --> 00:06:13,944
Will I really be
able to ride?

74
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,546
You will.

75
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,914
On horseback you will be
as tall as any of them.

76
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:21,217
Is this some kind of trick?
Why do you want to help him?

77
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:22,952
I have a tender spot
in my heart

78
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:25,889
for cripples, bastards
and broken things.

79
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,026
<i>You've done my brother</i>
<i>a kindness.</i>

80
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:31,363
The hospitality
of Winterfell is yours.

81
00:06:31,397 --> 00:06:34,232
Spare me your false courtesies,
Lord Stark.

82
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:36,468
There's a brothel
outside your walls.

83
00:06:36,502 --> 00:06:39,404
There I'll find a bed and both
of us can sleep easier.

84
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,079
Couldn't resist
some Northern ass?

85
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:49,882
If you like redheads,
ask for Ros.

86
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,785
Come to see me off, Greyjoy?
Kind of you.

87
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:55,354
Your master doesn't seem
to like Lannisters.

88
00:06:55,388 --> 00:06:58,324
- He's not my master.
- No, of course not.

89
00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:00,326
What happened here?

90
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,728
Where is Lady Stark?
Why didn't she receive me?

91
00:07:02,762 --> 00:07:05,631
- She wasn't feeling well.
- She's not in Winterfell, is she?

92
00:07:05,665 --> 00:07:07,866
- Where did she go?
- My Lady's whereabouts--

93
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,568
My Lady?

94
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:13,006
Your loyalty to your captors
is touching.

95
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,242
Tell me, how do you think
balon Greyjoy would feel

96
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:19,211
if he could see his only
surviving son has turned lackey?

97
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,581
I still remember seeing
my father's fleet

98
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:24,216
burn in Lannisport.

99
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:26,152
I believe your uncles
were responsible?

100
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:27,454
Must have been a pretty sight.

101
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,896
Nothing prettier than watching
sailors burn alive.

102
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:33,393
Yes, a great victory
for your people.

103
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:37,131
- Shame how it all turned out.
- We were outnumbered 10 to one--

104
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,200
a stupid rebellion then.

105
00:07:39,235 --> 00:07:41,236
I suppose your father
realized that

106
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,772
when your brothers
died in battle.

107
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:47,176
Now here you are,
your enemy's squire.

108
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,044
- Careful, imp.
- I've offended you.

109
00:07:49,078 --> 00:07:52,381
Forgive me, it's been
a rough morning.

110
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:55,817
Anyway, don't despair.

111
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:58,287
I'm a constant disappointment
to my own father

112
00:07:58,321 --> 00:08:00,055
and I've learned
to live with it.

113
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,958
Your next tumble with Ros is on me.

114
00:08:02,993 --> 00:08:06,261
I'll try not
to wear her out.

115
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:13,535
<i>Shoulder, legs.</i>

116
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:21,509
<i>Leg, shoulder, leg.</i>

117
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:24,445
<i>Left foot forward.</i>
<i>Good.</i>

118
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,881
Now pivot as you
deliver the stroke.

119
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:28,583
Put all your weight
behind it.

120
00:08:28,617 --> 00:08:30,951
What in seven hells
is that?

121
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:33,521
<i>They'll need an eighth hell</i>
<i>to fit him in.</i>

122
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,725
Tell them
your name.

123
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,960
Samwell Tarly,

124
00:08:39,995 --> 00:08:42,296
of Horn Hill--
I mean, I was of Horn Hill.

125
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,268
- I've come to take the black.
- Come to take the black pudding.

126
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:49,884
Well, you couldn't be
any worse than you look.

127
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:52,106
Rast...

128
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,342
<i>See what he can do.</i>

129
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,251
I yield.

130
00:09:05,286 --> 00:09:08,221
- Please, no more.
- On your feet.

131
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:10,289
Pick up your sword.

132
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:12,925
Hit him till he
finds his feet.

133
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:24,704
It seems they've run short of
poachers and thieves down South.

134
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:27,607
- <i>Now they send us squealing bloody pigs.</i>
- Jon!

135
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:30,210
<i>Again, harder.</i>

136
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:32,112
I yield!

137
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:33,647
Enough!

138
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:36,950
<i>He yielded.</i>

139
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,587
Looks like
the bastard's in love.

140
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:45,291
All right then,
Lord Snow,

141
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:48,561
you wish to defend your lady love,
let's make it an exercise.

142
00:09:48,595 --> 00:09:51,698
You two. Three of you ought
to be sufficient

143
00:09:51,732 --> 00:09:54,033
to make
lady piggy squeal.

144
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:57,136
All you've got to do is
get past the bastard.

145
00:09:59,106 --> 00:10:01,740
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- No.

146
00:10:15,556 --> 00:10:18,458
Yield yield yield!
I yield.

147
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:22,229
We're done
for today.

148
00:10:22,263 --> 00:10:23,997
Go clean the armory.

149
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:25,798
That's all
you're good for.

150
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:32,438
- Well fought!
- Piss off.

151
00:10:36,242 --> 00:10:37,976
Did he hurt you?

152
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,211
I've had worse.

153
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,049
You can call me Sam...
If you want.

154
00:10:44,084 --> 00:10:47,786
- My mother calls me Sam--
- it's not going to get any easier, you know?

155
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:50,056
You're going to have
to defend yourself.

156
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,991
Why didn't you get up
and fight?

157
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:55,328
I wanted to.

158
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,731
- <i>I just couldn't.</i>
- Why not?

159
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,602
I'm a coward.

160
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:06,206
- My father always says so.
- The Wall's no place for cowards.

161
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:08,308
You're right.
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:08,343 --> 00:11:11,477
I just... wanted
to thank you.

163
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:24,190
A bloody coward.

164
00:11:24,224 --> 00:11:26,292
People saw us
talking to him.

165
00:11:26,326 --> 00:11:28,461
Now they'll think
we're cowards too.

166
00:11:28,495 --> 00:11:30,195
You're too stupid
to be a coward.

167
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,531
- You're too stupid to be a--
- Quick now,

168
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:35,234
before summer's over.

169
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:37,469
C'mere!

170
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,200
Hyah hyah!

171
00:12:11,904 --> 00:12:15,674
Vaes Dothrak--
the city of the horselords.

172
00:12:17,811 --> 00:12:19,445
A pile of mud.

173
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:20,947
Mud and shit
and twigs--

174
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:24,250
- best these savages can do.
- These are <i>my</i> people now.

175
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:26,352
You shouldn't
call them savages.

176
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:28,487
I'll call them what I like,
because they're <i>my</i> people.

177
00:12:28,522 --> 00:12:30,856
This is my army.

178
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,292
Khal Drogo is marching the
wrong way with my army.

179
00:12:53,578 --> 00:12:56,847
If my brother <i>was</i> given
an army of Dothraki,

180
00:12:56,881 --> 00:13:00,617
could you conquer
the Seven Kingdoms?

181
00:13:00,651 --> 00:13:03,353
The Dothraki have never
crossed the Narrow Sea.

182
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:06,023
<i>They fear any water</i>
<i>their horses can't drink.</i>

183
00:13:06,057 --> 00:13:08,392
But if they did?

184
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:11,929
King Robert is fool enough
to meet them in open battle,

185
00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:14,898
<i>but the men</i>
<i>advising him are different.</i>

186
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:19,135
- And you know these men?
- I fought beside them once,

187
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,304
<i>long ago.</i>

188
00:13:21,338 --> 00:13:23,706
Now Ned Stark wants my head.

189
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:26,509
He drove me
from my land.

190
00:13:27,745 --> 00:13:29,846
You sold slaves.

191
00:13:31,048 --> 00:13:33,449
Aye.

192
00:13:34,318 --> 00:13:37,320
- Why?
- I had no money

193
00:13:37,354 --> 00:13:39,856
and an expensive wife.

194
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,725
And where is she now?

195
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,693
In another place,

196
00:13:43,728 --> 00:13:46,163
with another man.

197
00:13:51,836 --> 00:13:54,571
- Your Grace?
- Yes, my dear?

198
00:13:54,605 --> 00:13:57,374
They call you
the Last Dragon...

199
00:13:57,408 --> 00:14:00,110
They do.

200
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:03,548
You have dragon's blood

201
00:14:03,582 --> 00:14:05,483
in your veins?

202
00:14:05,518 --> 00:14:07,552
It's entirely possible.

203
00:14:07,587 --> 00:14:11,156
What happened to the dragons?

204
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,859
I was told that brave men
killed them all.

205
00:14:17,597 --> 00:14:20,232
The brave men
didn't kill dragons.

206
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:23,035
The brave men
rode them.

207
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,473
Rode them from Valyria
to build the greatest civilization

208
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:30,043
this world
has ever seen.

209
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,412
The breath
of the greatest dragon

210
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:34,448
forged the Iron Throne,

211
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:37,251
which the usurper is
keeping warm for me.

212
00:14:38,553 --> 00:14:41,088
The swords
of the vanquished,

213
00:14:41,123 --> 00:14:43,923
a thousand of them...

214
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:48,328
Melted together
like so many candles.

215
00:14:51,631 --> 00:14:54,733
I have always wanted
to see a dragon.

216
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:59,270
There is nothing in the world
that I would rather see.

217
00:14:59,305 --> 00:15:01,472
Really.
Why dragons?

218
00:15:01,506 --> 00:15:04,208
They can fly.

219
00:15:04,243 --> 00:15:07,346
And wherever they are,
just a few flaps of their wings

220
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,982
and they're
somewhere else...

221
00:15:10,017 --> 00:15:12,151
Far away.

222
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,957
And they can kill.

223
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:21,562
Anyone or anything that
tries to hurt them

224
00:15:21,596 --> 00:15:26,600
gets burned away to nothing...

225
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,203
...Like so many candles.

226
00:15:30,238 --> 00:15:31,404
Ow.

227
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:36,342
Yes.
Seeing a dragon

228
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:38,310
would make me very happy.

229
00:15:38,344 --> 00:15:40,913
Well, after 15 years
in a pleasure house,

230
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:43,148
I imagine just seeing
the sky makes you happy.

231
00:15:43,183 --> 00:15:46,251
I was not locked in.
I have seen things.

232
00:15:46,286 --> 00:15:48,254
- What have you seen?
- I've seen...

233
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:52,058
A man from Asshai with a dagger
of real dragonglass.

234
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:54,228
- Ooh.
- I've seen a man who could

235
00:15:54,262 --> 00:15:58,667
change his face the way that
other men change their clothes.

236
00:15:58,701 --> 00:16:02,705
And I've seen a pirate
who wore his weight in gold

237
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:06,875
and whose ship had
sails of colored silk.

238
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:11,347
So...

239
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:13,549
Have you seen one?

240
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:17,086
- A pirate ship?
- A dragon.

241
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:20,088
No.

242
00:16:20,123 --> 00:16:23,593
No, the last one died many years
before I was born.

243
00:16:23,627 --> 00:16:26,962
I'll tell you
what I have seen:

244
00:16:26,997 --> 00:16:29,565
Their skulls.

245
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,736
They used to decorate
the throne room in the Red Keep.

246
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,172
When I was very young,
just three or four,

247
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:37,408
my father used
to walk me down the rows

248
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:39,176
and I'd recite
their names for him.

249
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:42,047
When I got them all right,
he'd give me a sweet.

250
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:46,851
The ones closest to the door were
the last ones they were able to hatch

251
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:48,686
and they were all
stunted and wrong.

252
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,990
Skulls no bigger
than dog skulls.

253
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:56,962
But as you got closer
to the Iron Throne...

254
00:16:58,298 --> 00:17:00,332
They got bigger

255
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:03,435
and bigger and bigger.

256
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:08,740
There was Ghiscar

257
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:11,343
and Valryon,

258
00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:13,144
Vermithrax,

259
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:15,513
Essovius--

260
00:17:15,548 --> 00:17:18,049
Archonei,

261
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,052
Meraxes,

262
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:24,555
Vhagar...

263
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:28,961
And Balerion the dread...

264
00:17:28,995 --> 00:17:31,563
...Whose fire forged

265
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:33,700
the Seven Kingdoms

266
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:35,969
into one.

267
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:43,177
What happened
to the skulls?

268
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,048
I don't know.

269
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:50,384
The usurper had them
smashed to powder, I expect.

270
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:53,488
Scattered to the wind.

271
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:59,226
That's very sad.

272
00:17:59,261 --> 00:18:01,095
Yes, it is.

273
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:04,898
What did I buy you for?

274
00:18:04,932 --> 00:18:08,001
- To make me sad?
- No, your Grace.

275
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:12,438
To, uh, teach your sister.

276
00:18:12,473 --> 00:18:14,873
To teach my sister how
to be a better lover?

277
00:18:14,908 --> 00:18:18,810
You think I bought you to make
<i>Khal Drogo</i> happy?

278
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:26,252
Oh, you pretty
little idiot.

279
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:30,423
Go on then.
Get on with it.

280
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,935
Someday your husband
will sit there

281
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:45,237
and you will sit
by his side.

282
00:18:45,272 --> 00:18:50,410
And one day, before too long,
you will present your son to the court.

283
00:18:50,444 --> 00:18:53,012
All the Lords of Westeros

284
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:55,782
will gather here to see
the little prince--

285
00:18:55,816 --> 00:18:57,617
what if I have a girl?

286
00:18:57,652 --> 00:19:00,587
Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls
and plenty of them.

287
00:19:00,621 --> 00:19:03,222
What if I <i>only</i>
have girls?

288
00:19:03,257 --> 00:19:05,392
I wouldn't worry
about that.

289
00:19:05,426 --> 00:19:08,494
Jeyne Poole's mother had five children--
all of them girls.

290
00:19:08,528 --> 00:19:10,630
Yes, but it's
highly unlikely.

291
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:13,166
But what if?

292
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,402
Well, if you only
had girls,

293
00:19:16,437 --> 00:19:20,006
I suppose the throne would
pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.

294
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,976
And everyone
would hate me.

295
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,111
Nobody could ever
hate you.

296
00:19:25,146 --> 00:19:27,648
- Joffrey does.
- Nonsense.

297
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:30,717
Why would you say
such a thing?

298
00:19:32,186 --> 00:19:34,321
That business with the wolves?
Sansa,

299
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:36,757
I've told you
a hundred times:

300
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,526
- A direwolf is not--
- please shut up about it.

301
00:19:40,928 --> 00:19:42,729
Do you remember
your lessons?

302
00:19:44,532 --> 00:19:47,301
Who built the Iron Throne?

303
00:19:47,335 --> 00:19:49,403
Aegon the Conqueror.

304
00:19:49,437 --> 00:19:51,472
And who built
the Red Keep?

305
00:19:51,506 --> 00:19:53,073
Maegor the Cruel.

306
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,975
And how many years
did it take to build--

307
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:58,045
my grandfather and Uncle
were murdered here, weren't they?

308
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:02,782
They were killed on the orders of
King Aerys, yes.

309
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:07,120
- The Mad King.
- Commonly known as the Mad King.

310
00:20:07,154 --> 00:20:09,588
Why were they killed?

311
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,858
You should be speak to your
father about these matters.

312
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:15,893
I don't want to speak
to my father-- ever.

313
00:20:15,928 --> 00:20:19,397
Sansa, you will
find it in your heart

314
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:20,932
to forgive your father.

315
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:22,733
No, I won't.

316
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:25,035
It's The Hand's
tournament that's causing

317
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,738
- all this trouble, My Lords.
- The <i>King's</i> tournament.

318
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:31,408
I assure you The Hand
wants no part of it.

319
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:33,677
Call it what you will,
Lord Stark, Ser,

320
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:36,980
the city is packed with people
and more flooding in every day.

321
00:20:37,015 --> 00:20:40,183
Last night we had a tavern riot,
a brothel fire,

322
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:43,120
<i>three stabbings and a drunken horse race</i>
<i>down the Street of Sisters.</i>

323
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:45,989
- Dreadful.
- If you can't keep the King's peace,

324
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:49,059
perhaps the city watch should be
commanded by someone who can.

325
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:50,794
- I need more men.
- Ned: <i>You'll get 50.</i>

326
00:20:50,828 --> 00:20:53,764
- Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
- I will?

327
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:55,499
You found money
for a champion's purse,

328
00:20:55,533 --> 00:20:57,434
<i>you can find money</i>
<i>to keep the peace.</i>

329
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:01,305
I'll also give you
20 of my household guard

330
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:03,139
<i>till the crowds</i>
<i>have left.</i>

331
00:21:03,173 --> 00:21:04,808
Thank you,
My Lord Hand, Ser.

332
00:21:04,842 --> 00:21:06,576
They will be put
to good use.

333
00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:10,847
The sooner this is over,
the better.

334
00:21:10,881 --> 00:21:13,850
The realm prospers
from such events, My Lord.

335
00:21:13,884 --> 00:21:16,052
They give the great
a chance at glory,

336
00:21:16,086 --> 00:21:18,354
and the lowly a respite
from their woes.

337
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:20,824
<i>And every inn in</i>
<i>the city is full</i>

338
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:22,892
and the whores
are walking bow-legged.

339
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:25,395
I'm sure the tourney
puts coins in many a pocket.

340
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:27,964
- Hmmm.
- Now...

341
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:30,567
If there's nothing else,
My Lords?

342
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:42,612
Oh, this heat.

343
00:21:42,647 --> 00:21:45,448
On days like this,
I envy you Northerners

344
00:21:45,483 --> 00:21:47,217
your summer snows.

345
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:48,265
Until tomorrow, My Lord--

346
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,662
I've been hoping to talk
to you about Jon Arryn.

347
00:21:50,855 --> 00:21:53,723
Lord Arryn?

348
00:21:53,757 --> 00:21:55,925
Oh, his death was

349
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,694
a great sadness
to all of us.

350
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:00,963
I took personal charge
of his care,

351
00:22:00,997 --> 00:22:03,666
but I could not
save him.

352
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,969
His sickness struck him

353
00:22:06,003 --> 00:22:09,439
very hard and very fast.

354
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:12,009
I saw him in my chambers

355
00:22:12,043 --> 00:22:13,978
just the night
before he passed.

356
00:22:14,012 --> 00:22:17,181
Lord Jon often came
to me for counsel.

357
00:22:17,216 --> 00:22:19,952
Why?

358
00:22:19,986 --> 00:22:23,555
I have been Grand Maester
for many years.

359
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:27,025
Kings and Hands have come to me
for advice since--

360
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,962
What did Jon want
the night before he died?

361
00:22:29,996 --> 00:22:32,431
Oh, he came inquiring
after a book.

362
00:22:32,465 --> 00:22:34,200
A book?

363
00:22:34,234 --> 00:22:35,868
What book?

364
00:22:35,902 --> 00:22:37,603
Oh, I fear

365
00:22:37,638 --> 00:22:40,407
it would be of little interest
to you, My Lord.

366
00:22:40,441 --> 00:22:42,909
A ponderous Tome.

367
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,513
No, I'd like to read it.

368
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,519
"The Lineages and Histories

369
00:22:51,553 --> 00:22:54,723
of the Great H
of the Seven Kingdoms,

370
00:22:54,757 --> 00:22:58,427
with descriptions
of many high lords

371
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:01,564
and noble ladies

372
00:23:01,598 --> 00:23:03,732
and their children."

373
00:23:20,914 --> 00:23:23,316
"Harkon Umber,
first of his name,

374
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,153
born to Lord Hother Umber
and Lady Amaryllis Umber

375
00:23:27,187 --> 00:23:29,722
in the 183rd year
after Aegon's landing,

376
00:23:29,757 --> 00:23:33,060
at the last hearth.
Blue of eye, brown of hair

377
00:23:33,094 --> 00:23:36,597
and fair complected,
died in his 14th year

378
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:38,867
of a wound sustained
in a bear hunt."

379
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:42,671
As I said, My Lord,
a ponderous read.

380
00:23:42,705 --> 00:23:45,540
Did Jon Arryn tell you
what he wanted with it?

381
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:48,343
He did not, My Lord.
And I did not presume to ask.

382
00:23:48,377 --> 00:23:51,011
- Jon's death...
- Such a tragedy.

383
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:53,380
...Did he say anything to you
during his final hours?

384
00:23:53,415 --> 00:23:55,215
Nothing of import,
My Lord.

385
00:23:55,249 --> 00:23:58,051
Oh-- there was one phrase

386
00:23:58,085 --> 00:23:59,919
he kept repeating:

387
00:23:59,953 --> 00:24:03,422
"The seed is strong,"
I think it was.

388
00:24:03,457 --> 00:24:05,759
- "The seed is strong"?
- Mm.

389
00:24:05,793 --> 00:24:08,028
- What does that mean?
- Oh,

390
00:24:08,063 --> 00:24:11,165
the dying mind is
a demented mind, Lord Stark.

391
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,701
For all the weight
they're given,

392
00:24:13,736 --> 00:24:15,804
last words are usually

393
00:24:15,838 --> 00:24:17,907
as significant
as first words.

394
00:24:17,941 --> 00:24:20,876
And you're quite certain
he died of a natural illness?

395
00:24:20,911 --> 00:24:23,212
What else could it be?

396
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:25,748
Poison.

397
00:24:25,782 --> 00:24:28,451
A disturbing thought.

398
00:24:28,485 --> 00:24:30,653
No no no, I don't
think it likely.

399
00:24:30,687 --> 00:24:33,088
The Hand
was loved by all.

400
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:35,124
What sort of man
would dare--

401
00:24:35,158 --> 00:24:38,027
I've heard it said that poison
is a woman's weapon.

402
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:40,529
Yes, women,

403
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,464
cravens...

404
00:24:42,498 --> 00:24:45,166
And eunuchs.

405
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:48,604
Did you know that
Lord Varys is a eunuch?

406
00:24:48,638 --> 00:24:50,105
Everybody knows that.

407
00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:52,374
Yes yes, of course.

408
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:55,844
How that sort of <i>person</i>
found himself

409
00:24:55,879 --> 00:24:58,513
on the King's Council,
I will never know.

410
00:24:58,548 --> 00:25:00,248
I've taken enough
of your time.

411
00:25:00,283 --> 00:25:02,885
No trouble at all, My Lord.
It's a great honor--

412
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,653
thank you.

413
00:25:04,688 --> 00:25:06,622
I'll find my own way out.

414
00:25:29,148 --> 00:25:31,183
Syrio says a water dancer

415
00:25:31,217 --> 00:25:32,917
can stand on one toe
for hours.

416
00:25:32,952 --> 00:25:35,754
It's a hard fall
down these steps.

417
00:25:35,788 --> 00:25:37,756
Syrio says every hurt
is a lesson

418
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:39,992
and every lesson
makes you better.

419
00:25:41,528 --> 00:25:44,530
- Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
- Cats?

420
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:46,065
Syrio says.

421
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:48,167
He says every swordsman
should study cats.

422
00:25:48,202 --> 00:25:51,238
They're quiet as shadows
and as light as feathers.

423
00:25:51,272 --> 00:25:53,540
You have to be
quick to catch them.

424
00:25:53,575 --> 00:25:55,410
He's right about that.

425
00:25:55,444 --> 00:25:56,878
Now that Bran's awake

426
00:25:56,912 --> 00:25:59,715
will he come
live with us?

427
00:26:01,484 --> 00:26:04,687
Well, he needs to get
his strength back first.

428
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:07,189
He wants to be
a knight of the Kingsguard.

429
00:26:07,223 --> 00:26:11,594
- He can't be one now, can he?
- No.

430
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,564
But someday

431
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,900
he could be
Lord of a Holdfast

432
00:26:17,934 --> 00:26:20,168
or sit on
the King's Council.

433
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,605
Or he might raise castles

434
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:25,173
like Brandon the builder.

435
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,943
Can I be Lord
of a Holdfast?

436
00:26:32,314 --> 00:26:35,316
You will marry
a high lord

437
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,351
and rule his castle.

438
00:26:37,385 --> 00:26:39,752
And your sons
shall be knights

439
00:26:39,787 --> 00:26:42,388
and princes and lords.

440
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:46,459
Hmm?
No.

441
00:26:47,394 --> 00:26:49,862
That's not me.

442
00:27:11,987 --> 00:27:14,121
Hello.

443
00:27:15,624 --> 00:27:18,225
Ser Alliser said I'm to be
your new Watch partner.

444
00:27:20,395 --> 00:27:21,929
I should warn you,

445
00:27:21,963 --> 00:27:24,832
I don't see
all that well.

446
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,002
Come stand by the fire.

447
00:27:29,371 --> 00:27:31,606
- It's warmer.
- No, that's all right. I'm fine.

448
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,008
You're not.
You're freezing.

449
00:27:45,854 --> 00:27:48,790
I don't like
high places.

450
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:50,559
You can't fight.

451
00:27:50,593 --> 00:27:52,361
You can't see.

452
00:27:52,396 --> 00:27:55,732
You're afraid of heights
and almost everything else probably.

453
00:27:57,435 --> 00:27:59,369
What are you
doing here, Sam?

454
00:28:03,742 --> 00:28:07,444
On the morning of my 18th Nameday,
my father came to me.

455
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,048
"You're almost
a man now," he said...

456
00:28:12,384 --> 00:28:15,619
"But you're not worthy
of my land and title.

457
00:28:16,888 --> 00:28:19,190
Tomorrow, you're going
to take the black,

458
00:28:19,224 --> 00:28:22,526
forsake all claim to your
inheritance and start North.

459
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,964
If you do not,"
he said...

460
00:28:27,932 --> 00:28:30,133
"Then we'll have a hunt

461
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:33,203
and somewhere in these woods
your horse will stumble

462
00:28:33,237 --> 00:28:36,073
and you'll be thrown
from your saddle to die.

463
00:28:38,576 --> 00:28:41,111
Or so I'll tell
your mother.

464
00:28:41,146 --> 00:28:43,313
Nothing would
please me more."

465
00:28:48,486 --> 00:28:51,588
Ser Alliser's going to make me
fight again tomorrow, isn't he?

466
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:54,892
Yes, he is.

467
00:28:54,926 --> 00:28:57,695
I'm not going to get
any better, you know?

468
00:28:59,131 --> 00:29:01,032
Well...

469
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:02,867
You can't get any worse.

470
00:29:12,643 --> 00:29:15,444
I hear you're reading
a boring book.

471
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:17,279
Hmph.

472
00:29:17,314 --> 00:29:19,448
Pycelle talks too much.

473
00:29:19,482 --> 00:29:21,383
Oh, he never stops.

474
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:23,918
Do you know Ser Hugh
of the Vale?

475
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,455
Not surprising.
Until recently,

476
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:31,025
he was only a squire--
Jon Arryn's squire.

477
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,027
He was knighted
almost immediately

478
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,463
after his master's
untimely death.

479
00:29:35,497 --> 00:29:37,799
Knighted for what?

480
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:40,401
Why are you
telling me this?

481
00:29:40,435 --> 00:29:42,136
I promised cat
that I'd help you.

482
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,638
Where is Ser Hugh?

483
00:29:44,673 --> 00:29:47,574
- I'll speak to him.
- A singularly bad idea.

484
00:29:47,609 --> 00:29:49,776
Do you see
that boy there?

485
00:29:49,811 --> 00:29:52,445
One of Varys's little birds.

486
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,282
The spider has taken a great
interest in your comings and goings.

487
00:29:56,316 --> 00:29:58,217
Now look there.

488
00:29:58,252 --> 00:30:00,986
That one belongs
to the Queen.

489
00:30:01,021 --> 00:30:04,156
And do you see that septa
pretending to read her book?

490
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,058
Varys or the Queen?

491
00:30:07,092 --> 00:30:09,794
No, she's one
of mine.

492
00:30:11,496 --> 00:30:14,731
Is there someone in your service
whom you trust completely?

493
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,236
- Yes.
- The wiser answer was no, My Lord.

494
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:24,274
Get a message to
this paragon of yours--

495
00:30:24,308 --> 00:30:27,477
discreetly--
send him to question Ser Hugh.

496
00:30:27,511 --> 00:30:31,749
After that, you might want him
to visit a certain armorer in the city.

497
00:30:31,783 --> 00:30:35,386
He lives in a large house at the top
of the Street of Steel.

498
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,822
- Why?
- I have my observers, as I said,

499
00:30:37,857 --> 00:30:40,358
and it's possible
that they saw Lord Arryn

500
00:30:40,393 --> 00:30:44,296
visit this armorer several times
in the weeks before his death.

501
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:48,933
Lord Baelish, perhaps I was
wrong to distrust you.

502
00:30:48,968 --> 00:30:50,835
Distrusting me was
the wisest thing

503
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,471
you've done since you climbed
off your horse.

504
00:30:59,944 --> 00:31:03,079
...Two, three,

505
00:31:03,113 --> 00:31:04,914
24, five,

506
00:31:04,949 --> 00:31:07,250
six, 27,

507
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:09,285
- 28, 29--
- Ser Hugh?

508
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,988
30, 31, 32

509
00:31:11,022 --> 00:31:13,290
- Ser Hugh!
- As you can see, I'm busy.

510
00:31:13,324 --> 00:31:16,260
I'm here on behalf
of Lord Eddard Stark,

511
00:31:16,295 --> 00:31:18,563
the Hand of the King.

512
00:31:18,597 --> 00:31:19,997
I'm the Captain
of his guard.

513
00:31:20,032 --> 00:31:22,200
I'm sorry, I didn't catch
your name, Ser...

514
00:31:22,234 --> 00:31:24,903
No "Ser."
I'm not a knight.

515
00:31:24,937 --> 00:31:28,239
I see. Well, it just
so happens that I am.

516
00:31:32,977 --> 00:31:35,946
He said he'd be glad
to talk to the hand himself.

517
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,814
He's a <i>knight,</i>
you see.

518
00:31:37,848 --> 00:31:39,582
Ah, a knight.

519
00:31:39,616 --> 00:31:42,484
They strut around
like roosters down here.

520
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:46,188
<i>Even the ones who've never seen</i>
<i>an arrow coming their way.</i>

521
00:31:46,222 --> 00:31:48,090
You shouldn't be
out here, My Lord.

522
00:31:48,124 --> 00:31:51,560
- There's no telling who has eyes where.
- Let them look.

523
00:31:53,563 --> 00:31:56,398
The former Hand did call on me,
My Lord, several times.

524
00:31:56,433 --> 00:31:59,768
I regret to say he did not honor me
with his patronage.

525
00:31:59,803 --> 00:32:02,337
What did
Lord Arryn want?

526
00:32:02,372 --> 00:32:04,439
He always came to see the boy.

527
00:32:04,474 --> 00:32:06,375
I'd like to see him
as well.

528
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,745
As you Gendry! My lord.

529
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:16,116
Here he is.

530
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,785
Strong for his age.
He works hard.

531
00:32:18,819 --> 00:32:21,955
Show the hand
the helmet you made, lad.

532
00:32:35,804 --> 00:32:38,573
- This is fine work.
- It's not for sale.

533
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:40,508
Boy, this is
the King's Hand!

534
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:43,946
- If his lordship wants the helm--
- I made it for me.

535
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,615
- Forgive him, My Lord.
- There's nothing to forgive.

536
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:50,852
When Lord Arryn came to visit you,
what would you talk about?

537
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:53,388
He just asked me questions
is all, My Lord.

538
00:32:53,422 --> 00:32:55,590
What kind
of questions?

539
00:32:57,693 --> 00:32:59,994
About my work at first,

540
00:33:00,028 --> 00:33:03,631
if I was being treated well,
if I liked it here.

541
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:07,602
But then he started
asking me about my mother.

542
00:33:08,971 --> 00:33:12,039
- Your mother?
- Who she was, what she looked like.

543
00:33:12,975 --> 00:33:14,809
What did you tell him?

544
00:33:16,512 --> 00:33:18,580
She died when I was little.

545
00:33:18,614 --> 00:33:20,848
She had yellow hair.

546
00:33:20,883 --> 00:33:23,518
She'd sing to me sometimes.

547
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,291
Look at me.

548
00:33:39,002 --> 00:33:40,937
Get back to work, lad.

549
00:33:42,673 --> 00:33:44,674
If the day ever comes
when that boy

550
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,876
would rather wield
a sword than forge one,

551
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,311
<i>you send him to me.</i>

552
00:33:54,084 --> 00:33:56,118
Find anything?

553
00:33:57,154 --> 00:33:59,955
King Robert's
bastard son.

554
00:34:02,325 --> 00:34:05,027
<i>He likes that.</i>

555
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,366
This is for the King
from Lord Stark.

556
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,635
Should I leave it with--

557
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,404
shhh.

558
00:34:13,438 --> 00:34:15,273
Listen.

559
00:34:15,307 --> 00:34:18,043
Do you hear them?

560
00:34:20,347 --> 00:34:22,581
How many do you think
are in there with him?

561
00:34:22,615 --> 00:34:24,416
Huh?

562
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,251
- <i>Guess.</i>
- Three?

563
00:34:26,285 --> 00:34:28,586
Four.

564
00:34:30,288 --> 00:34:32,557
He likes to do this
when I'm on duty--

565
00:34:32,591 --> 00:34:35,159
he makes me listen
as he insults my sister.

566
00:34:40,866 --> 00:34:41,689
Forgive me, My Lord--

567
00:34:41,714 --> 00:34:43,715
Why do I have to forgive you?
Have you wronged me?

568
00:34:46,237 --> 00:34:48,038
We've met before, you know.

569
00:34:48,073 --> 00:34:51,042
Have we?
Strange, I've forgotten.

570
00:34:51,076 --> 00:34:54,513
The siege of Pyke.
We fought side by side one afternoon.

571
00:34:54,547 --> 00:34:56,348
Ah.

572
00:34:56,382 --> 00:34:58,417
- That's where you got your scar?
- Aye.

573
00:34:58,451 --> 00:34:59,852
Oh.

574
00:34:59,887 --> 00:35:01,721
One of the Greyjoys
nearly took my eye.

575
00:35:01,756 --> 00:35:04,725
- Vicious sons of whores.
- They like their bloodshed.

576
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:06,927
<i>They stopped liking it</i>
<i>at the end.</i>

577
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:10,964
That was a proper battle.
Do you remember

578
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:14,034
Thoros of Myr charging
through the breach?

579
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:15,602
With his burning sword?

580
00:35:15,637 --> 00:35:17,505
I'll remember that
till the day I die.

581
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:21,376
I saw the youngest of the
Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.

582
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,778
It was like seeing a shark
on a mountaintop.

583
00:35:23,812 --> 00:35:26,080
Theon?
He's a good lad.

584
00:35:26,115 --> 00:35:27,215
I doubt it.

585
00:35:32,055 --> 00:35:34,590
<i>I'll bet you smell</i>
<i>of blackberry jam!</i>

586
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:36,993
<i>Let me smell it.</i>
<i>Come here.</i>

587
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,530
Can I leave this
with you?

588
00:35:40,565 --> 00:35:42,199
The message
from Lord Stark.

589
00:35:42,233 --> 00:35:44,568
I don't serve Lord Stark.

590
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:10,125
- Where have you been?
- Watch duty.

591
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:12,527
- With Sam.
- Ah, prince porkchop.

592
00:36:12,562 --> 00:36:14,696
- Where is he?
- He wasn't hungry.

593
00:36:14,731 --> 00:36:16,398
Impossible!

594
00:36:16,432 --> 00:36:18,968
That's enough.

595
00:36:24,175 --> 00:36:26,576
Sam's no different
from the rest of us.

596
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,912
There was no place
for him in the world,

597
00:36:28,946 --> 00:36:30,746
so he's come here.

598
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:33,216
We're not going to hurt him
in the training yard anymore.

599
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,118
Never again,
no matter what Thorne says.

600
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:39,121
He's our brother now
and we're going to protect him.

601
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,823
You <i>are</i> in love, Lord Snow.

602
00:36:44,293 --> 00:36:47,262
You girls can do
as you please.

603
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:50,132
But if Thorne puts me
up against lady piggy,

604
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,234
I'm gonna slice me off
a side of bacon.

605
00:37:15,294 --> 00:37:17,996
No one touches Sam.

606
00:37:32,278 --> 00:37:34,613
What are you
waiting for?

607
00:37:44,524 --> 00:37:46,925
Attack him!

608
00:37:55,835 --> 00:37:58,136
You get in there.

609
00:38:02,108 --> 00:38:03,608
Hit me.

610
00:38:05,811 --> 00:38:07,812
Go on, hit me!

611
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:12,350
<i>I yield!</i>

612
00:38:12,384 --> 00:38:14,352
Yield yield.

613
00:38:14,386 --> 00:38:16,620
<i>I yield.</i>

614
00:38:19,491 --> 00:38:22,493
You think this
is funny, do you?

615
00:38:25,598 --> 00:38:27,098
When you're out there

616
00:38:27,133 --> 00:38:29,834
beyond The Wall
with the sun going down,

617
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:32,304
do you want
a man at your back?

618
00:38:32,338 --> 00:38:34,640
Or a sniveling boy?

619
00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:51,857
You send this whore
to give me commands?

620
00:38:51,892 --> 00:38:54,426
I should have sent
you back her head!

621
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,361
Forgive me, Khaleesi.
I did as you asked.

622
00:38:56,396 --> 00:38:57,996
Hush now.
It's all right.

623
00:38:58,031 --> 00:39:01,333
- Irri, take her and leave us.
- <i>Yes, Khaleesi.</i>

624
00:39:04,671 --> 00:39:07,739
- Why did you hit her?!
- How many times do I have to tell you?

625
00:39:07,774 --> 00:39:09,374
You do not command me.

626
00:39:09,409 --> 00:39:11,175
I wasn't commanding you.

627
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,010
I just wanted to invite
you to supper.

628
00:39:13,045 --> 00:39:15,313
- What's this?
- It's a gift.

629
00:39:15,347 --> 00:39:18,283
- I had it made for you.
- Dothraki rags?

630
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:20,351
- Are you going to dress me now?
- Please.

631
00:39:20,386 --> 00:39:22,420
This stinks of manure.
All of it.

632
00:39:22,455 --> 00:39:24,826
Stop-- stop it.

633
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:26,321
You would turn me into one
of them, wouldn't you?

634
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:27,992
Next you'll want
to braid my hair.

635
00:39:28,026 --> 00:39:30,060
You've no right
to a braid.

636
00:39:30,094 --> 00:39:31,561
You've won
no victories yet.

637
00:39:31,596 --> 00:39:34,731
You do not
talk back to me!

638
00:39:36,033 --> 00:39:38,534
You are a horselord's slut.

639
00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:40,503
And now you've woken
the dragon--

640
00:39:46,143 --> 00:39:49,713
I am a Khaleesi
of the Dothraki!

641
00:39:49,747 --> 00:39:52,116
I am the wife
of the great Khal

642
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,919
and I carry his son
inside me.

643
00:39:54,953 --> 00:39:58,723
The next time
you raise a hand to me

644
00:39:58,757 --> 00:40:01,993
will be the last time
you have hands.

645
00:40:09,802 --> 00:40:11,703
I know for a fact
that some of the officers

646
00:40:11,738 --> 00:40:13,705
go to that brothel
in mole's town.

647
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,540
I wouldn't doubt it.

648
00:40:15,575 --> 00:40:18,009
Don't you think it's
a little bit unfair?

649
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:20,178
Making us take our vows
while they sneak off

650
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:22,813
for a little
sally on the side?

651
00:40:22,847 --> 00:40:25,616
- Sally on the side?
- It's silly, isn't it?

652
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:28,987
What, we can't defend
the wall unless we're celibate?

653
00:40:29,021 --> 00:40:30,844
It's absurd.

654
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:32,923
I didn't think you'd be
so upset about it.

655
00:40:34,327 --> 00:40:36,595
Why not?

656
00:40:36,629 --> 00:40:39,090
- Because I'm fat?
- No.

657
00:40:39,098 --> 00:40:42,210
But I like girls just
as much as you do.

658
00:40:43,337 --> 00:40:45,906
They might not
like me as much.

659
00:40:47,842 --> 00:40:51,111
I've never--
been with one.

660
00:40:52,446 --> 00:40:54,381
You've probably
had hundreds.

661
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:56,083
No.

662
00:40:58,386 --> 00:41:00,921
As a matter of fact,

663
00:41:00,956 --> 00:41:02,389
I'm the same as you.

664
00:41:02,424 --> 00:41:04,424
Yeah.

665
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:06,660
I find that hard
to believe.

666
00:41:06,694 --> 00:41:08,996
I came very close once.

667
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:12,465
I was alone in a room
with a naked girl, but--

668
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,801
you didn't know
where to put it?

669
00:41:14,835 --> 00:41:16,869
I know where to put it.

670
00:41:16,904 --> 00:41:18,938
Was she...

671
00:41:18,973 --> 00:41:21,107
Old and ugly?

672
00:41:22,142 --> 00:41:23,909
Young and gorgeous.

673
00:41:25,545 --> 00:41:27,446
A whore named Ros.

674
00:41:29,415 --> 00:41:31,216
What color hair?

675
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,085
- Red.
- Oh, I like red hair.

676
00:41:35,654 --> 00:41:37,421
And her, um...

677
00:41:37,456 --> 00:41:39,156
Her...

678
00:41:40,258 --> 00:41:41,858
- You don't want to know.
- That good?

679
00:41:41,893 --> 00:41:43,660
- Better.
- Oh no.

680
00:41:45,363 --> 00:41:47,999
So why exactly

681
00:41:48,033 --> 00:41:51,736
did you not make love
to Ros with the perfect--?

682
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:54,239
What's my name?

683
00:41:54,273 --> 00:41:56,175
Jon Snow?

684
00:41:56,209 --> 00:41:59,512
And why is
my surname snow?

685
00:41:59,546 --> 00:42:02,349
Because...

686
00:42:02,383 --> 00:42:04,951
You're a bastard
from the North.

687
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,022
I never met my mother.

688
00:42:09,056 --> 00:42:12,024
My father wouldn't even
tell me her name.

689
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:14,694
I don't know if she's
living or dead.

690
00:42:16,697 --> 00:42:19,164
I don't know
if she's a noblewoman

691
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:20,833
or a Fisherman's wife...

692
00:42:22,535 --> 00:42:24,536
Or a whore.

693
00:42:26,773 --> 00:42:29,141
So I sat there

694
00:42:29,175 --> 00:42:32,378
in the brothel as Ros
took off her clothes.

695
00:42:32,412 --> 00:42:35,982
But I couldn't do it.

696
00:42:36,016 --> 00:42:39,019
Because all I could
think was

697
00:42:39,053 --> 00:42:41,722
what if I got her pregnant

698
00:42:41,756 --> 00:42:43,791
and she had a child,

699
00:42:43,825 --> 00:42:46,760
another bastard named Snow?

700
00:42:51,299 --> 00:42:54,135
It's not a good life
for a child.

701
00:42:54,169 --> 00:42:56,370
Ah, mmm.

702
00:42:59,174 --> 00:43:01,008
So...

703
00:43:01,042 --> 00:43:03,444
You didn't know
where to put it?

704
00:43:09,117 --> 00:43:11,252
<i>Enjoying yourselves?</i>

705
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:15,190
You look cold, boys.

706
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:18,493
It is a bit nippy.

707
00:43:18,527 --> 00:43:20,929
A bit nippy,
yeah, by the fire,

708
00:43:20,963 --> 00:43:25,100
indoors.
It's still summer.

709
00:43:26,268 --> 00:43:28,971
Do you boys even remember
the last winter?

710
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,775
How long has it been now?
What, 10 years?

711
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:34,910
I remember.

712
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,646
Was it uncomfortable
at Winterfell?

713
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:40,316
Were there days when
you just couldn't get warm,

714
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:43,185
never mind how many fires
your servants built?

715
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,421
- I build my own fires.
- That's admirable.

716
00:43:47,957 --> 00:43:50,625
I spent six months out there,
beyond The Wall

717
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,562
<i>during the last winter.</i>

718
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:56,699
It was supposed to be
a two-week mission.

719
00:43:56,734 --> 00:44:00,169
We heard a rumor Mance Rayder
was planning to attack Eastwatch.

720
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:03,573
So we went out to look
for some of his men--

721
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:06,509
capture them,
gather some knowledge.

722
00:44:06,544 --> 00:44:09,512
The Wildlings who fight
for Mance Rayder are hard men.

723
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:12,581
Harder than you'll ever be.

724
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:15,050
They know their country
better than we do.

725
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:17,420
They knew there was
a storm coming in.

726
00:44:18,755 --> 00:44:21,724
So they hid in their caves
and waited for it to pass.

727
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:25,694
And we got caught
in the open.

728
00:44:25,728 --> 00:44:28,030
Wind so strong

729
00:44:28,064 --> 00:44:30,566
it yanked 100-foot trees
straight from the ground,

730
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,069
<i>roots and all.</i>
<i>If you took your gloves off</i>

731
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,104
<i>to find your cock</i>
<i>to have a piss,</i>

732
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,440
you lost a finger
to the frost.

733
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:39,808
And all in darkness.

734
00:44:43,046 --> 00:44:45,514
You don't know cold.

735
00:44:45,548 --> 00:44:47,949
Neither of you do.

736
00:44:50,086 --> 00:44:52,721
The horses died first.

737
00:44:54,557 --> 00:44:57,659
We didn't have enough to feed them,
to keep them warm.

738
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:02,364
Eating the horses was easy.

739
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:07,435
But later when <i>we</i>
started to fall...

740
00:45:09,171 --> 00:45:11,439
That wasn't easy.

741
00:45:11,473 --> 00:45:15,008
We should have had a couple of
boys like you along, shouldn't we?

742
00:45:20,748 --> 00:45:22,982
Soft, fat boys like you.

743
00:45:23,017 --> 00:45:25,486
We'd have lasted
a fortnight on you

744
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,556
and still had bones
leftover for soup.

745
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:34,062
Soon we'll have
new recruits

746
00:45:34,096 --> 00:45:37,132
and you lot will be passed along
to the Lord Commander

747
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:39,301
for assignment

748
00:45:39,335 --> 00:45:43,272
and they will call you
men of The Night's Watch,

749
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:46,041
but you'd be fools
to believe it.

750
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:49,478
<i>You're boys still.</i>

751
00:45:49,512 --> 00:45:52,614
<i>And come the winter</i>
<i>you will die...</i>

752
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:56,750
Like flies.

753
00:46:02,456 --> 00:46:04,825
I hit him.

754
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:06,760
I hit the dragon.

755
00:46:06,795 --> 00:46:09,230
Your brother Rhaegar
was the Last Dragon.

756
00:46:09,264 --> 00:46:12,167
Viserys is less than
the shadow of a snake.

757
00:46:12,201 --> 00:46:14,069
He is still
the true king.

758
00:46:14,103 --> 00:46:16,104
The truth now:

759
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:19,408
Do you want to see your brother
sitting on the Iron Throne?

760
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,944
No.

761
00:46:21,978 --> 00:46:24,880
But the common people
are waiting for him.

762
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:29,251
Illyrio said they are sewing dragon
banners and praying for his return.

763
00:46:29,285 --> 00:46:33,421
The common people pray for rain,
health and a summer that never ends.

764
00:46:33,456 --> 00:46:36,924
They don't care what games
the high lords play.

765
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:39,793
What do you pray for,
Ser Jorah?

766
00:46:43,864 --> 00:46:46,833
Home.

767
00:46:46,867 --> 00:46:49,035
I pray for home too.

768
00:46:52,373 --> 00:46:55,509
My brother will never take back
the Seven Kingdoms.

769
00:46:57,178 --> 00:47:00,481
He couldn't lead an army
even if my husband gave him one.

770
00:47:03,852 --> 00:47:06,287
He'll never take us home.

771
00:47:25,741 --> 00:47:28,109
Lover's quarrel?

772
00:47:28,144 --> 00:47:29,945
I'm sorry.
Do I...?

773
00:47:29,979 --> 00:47:33,082
Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish.
He's known--

774
00:47:33,117 --> 00:47:34,617
an old friend
of the family.

775
00:47:34,652 --> 00:47:37,855
I've known your mother
a long long time.

776
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:40,190
- Why do they call you Littlefinger?
- Arya!

777
00:47:40,225 --> 00:47:43,193
- Don't be rude!
- No, it's quite all right.

778
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:46,863
When I was a child
I was very small

779
00:47:46,898 --> 00:47:49,766
and I come from a little spit of land
called The Fingers,

780
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,568
so you see,

781
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,669
it's an exceedingly
clever nickname.

782
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,238
I've been sitting here
for days!

783
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,273
Start the damn joust

784
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,242
before I piss myself!

785
00:48:07,783 --> 00:48:10,352
Gods, who is that?

786
00:48:10,386 --> 00:48:12,888
<i>Ser Gregor Clegane.</i>

787
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:16,025
<i>They call him the Mountain.</i>

788
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:20,130
<i>The hound's older brother.</i>

789
00:48:20,164 --> 00:48:23,133
- And his opponent?
- Littlefinger: Ser Hugh of the Vale.

790
00:48:23,168 --> 00:48:25,569
<i>He was</i>
<i>Jon Arryn's squire.</i>

791
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:27,270
<i>Lo how far he's come.</i>

792
00:48:27,305 --> 00:48:29,539
Yes yes, enough
of the bloody pomp.

793
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:31,040
Have at it!

794
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:54,095
Not what you
were expecting?

795
00:49:56,933 --> 00:50:00,702
Has anyone ever told you the story
of the Mountain and the Hound?

796
00:50:01,905 --> 00:50:04,340
Lovely little tale
of brotherly love.

797
00:50:05,775 --> 00:50:08,644
The Hound was just a pup,

798
00:50:08,678 --> 00:50:11,079
six years old maybe.

799
00:50:11,113 --> 00:50:13,315
Gregor a few years older--

800
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:16,785
already a big lad, already
getting a bit of a reputation.

801
00:50:16,819 --> 00:50:19,254
Some lucky boys

802
00:50:19,288 --> 00:50:22,457
<i>just born with a talent</i>
<i>for violence.</i>

803
00:50:23,826 --> 00:50:27,129
<i>One evening Gregor found</i>
<i>his little brother</i>

804
00:50:27,163 --> 00:50:29,799
<i>playing with a toy</i>
<i>by the fire--</i>

805
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:32,034
<i>Gregor's toy,</i>

806
00:50:32,068 --> 00:50:34,470
a wooden knight.

807
00:50:34,504 --> 00:50:36,972
Gregor never said a word,

808
00:50:37,007 --> 00:50:39,775
he just grabbed his brother
by the scruff of his neck

809
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:43,012
<i>and shoved his face</i>
<i>into the burning coals.</i>

810
00:50:43,046 --> 00:50:45,281
<i>Held him there</i>

811
00:50:45,315 --> 00:50:47,283
<i>while the boy screamed,</i>

812
00:50:47,317 --> 00:50:49,718
<i>while his face melted.</i>

813
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,592
There aren't very many people
who know that story.

814
00:50:56,627 --> 00:50:59,295
I won't tell anyone.
I promise.

815
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:01,230
No, please don't.

816
00:51:01,265 --> 00:51:03,699
If the Hound so much as
heard you mention it,

817
00:51:03,733 --> 00:51:06,735
I'm afraid all the knights
in King's Landing

818
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:09,104
would not be able
to save you.

819
00:51:21,748 --> 00:51:24,850
My Lord,
her Grace the Queen.

820
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,522
- Your Grace.
- You're missing your tournament.

821
00:51:30,556 --> 00:51:33,124
Putting my name on it
doesn't make it mine.

822
00:51:35,161 --> 00:51:38,363
I thought we might put what happened
on the Kingsroad behind us--

823
00:51:38,397 --> 00:51:40,632
the ugliness
with the wolves.

824
00:51:42,802 --> 00:51:45,404
And forcing you to kill
the beast was extreme.

825
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,143
Though sometimes we go to extremes
where our children are concerned.

826
00:51:51,578 --> 00:51:53,379
How is Sansa?

827
00:51:53,414 --> 00:51:55,315
She likes it here.

828
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:57,083
<i>She's the only</i>
<i>Stark who does.</i>

829
00:51:57,118 --> 00:51:59,619
Favors her mother,

830
00:51:59,653 --> 00:52:01,421
not much
of the North in her.

831
00:52:01,455 --> 00:52:04,858
- What are you doing here?
- I might ask the same of you.

832
00:52:04,892 --> 00:52:07,060
What is it you
hope to accomplish?

833
00:52:07,094 --> 00:52:10,163
The King called on me
to serve him and the realm,

834
00:52:10,198 --> 00:52:12,932
and that's what I'll do
until he tells me otherwise.

835
00:52:12,967 --> 00:52:15,434
You can't change him.
You can't help him.

836
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:18,037
He'll do what he wants, which is
all he's ever done.

837
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:21,039
You'll try your best
to pick up the pieces.

838
00:52:21,074 --> 00:52:23,809
If that's my job,
then so be it.

839
00:52:25,311 --> 00:52:27,747
You're just a soldier,
aren't you?

840
00:52:27,781 --> 00:52:30,516
You take your orders
and you carry on.

841
00:52:31,552 --> 00:52:33,719
I suppose it makes sense.

842
00:52:33,754 --> 00:52:37,090
Your older brother was trained to
lead and you were trained to follow.

843
00:52:37,124 --> 00:52:40,092
I was also trained to kill
my enemies, your Grace.

844
00:52:43,531 --> 00:52:45,632
As was I.

845
00:53:03,516 --> 00:53:05,484
Seven blessings to you,
goodfolk!

846
00:53:05,518 --> 00:53:07,853
And to you.

847
00:53:07,887 --> 00:53:09,854
Boy!
Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.

848
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:12,290
Ah, good idea, grandfather.
I'm starving.

849
00:53:12,324 --> 00:53:14,125
A song
while we wait or--?

850
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:15,960
I'd rather throw myself
down a well.

851
00:53:15,994 --> 00:53:19,630
Now now, grandfather, this may be your
last chance if you're heading North.

852
00:53:19,665 --> 00:53:22,667
The only music the Northerners know is
the howling of wolves!

853
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,437
Gods.

854
00:53:26,471 --> 00:53:27,972
I'm sorry, My Lord.
We're full up.

855
00:53:28,006 --> 00:53:31,008
- <i>Every room.</i>
- Tyrion: <i>My men can sleep in the stable.</i>

856
00:53:31,043 --> 00:53:33,678
As for myself, I don't
require a large room.

857
00:53:33,712 --> 00:53:36,881
Truly, My Lord,
we have nothing.

858
00:53:36,915 --> 00:53:39,250
Is there nothing I can do...

859
00:53:39,284 --> 00:53:41,853
...To remedy this?

860
00:53:41,887 --> 00:53:43,755
You can have my room.

861
00:53:43,789 --> 00:53:45,323
Now there's
a clever man.

862
00:53:47,226 --> 00:53:49,961
You can manage food, I trust?
Yoren, dine with me.

863
00:53:49,995 --> 00:53:52,097
- Aye, My Lord.
- My Lord of Lannister!

864
00:53:52,131 --> 00:53:54,232
Might I entertain you
while you eat?

865
00:53:54,266 --> 00:53:57,168
I can sing of your father's victory
at King's Landing!

866
00:53:57,202 --> 00:53:59,836
Nothing would more likely
ruin my supper.

867
00:54:00,805 --> 00:54:02,472
Lady Stark!

868
00:54:02,506 --> 00:54:05,208
<i>What an unexpected</i>
<i>pleasure.</i>

869
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,778
I was sorry to have
missed you at Winterfell.

870
00:54:08,813 --> 00:54:10,680
Lady Stark!

871
00:54:18,522 --> 00:54:20,690
I was still Catelyn Tully

872
00:54:20,725 --> 00:54:23,226
the last time
I stayed here.

873
00:54:25,597 --> 00:54:28,365
You, Ser,

874
00:54:28,399 --> 00:54:32,636
is that the black bat of Harrenhal
I see embroidered on your coat?

875
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,705
It is, My Lady.

876
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:37,575
And is Lady Whent
a true and honest friend

877
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:41,413
to my father, Lord Hoster Tully
of Riverrun?

878
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:43,216
She is.

879
00:54:45,352 --> 00:54:48,721
The red stallion was always
a welcome sight at Riverrun.

880
00:54:48,755 --> 00:54:50,957
My father counts
Jonas Bracken

881
00:54:50,991 --> 00:54:54,093
amongst his oldest
and most loyal bannermen.

882
00:54:54,127 --> 00:54:55,995
Our lord is honored
by his trust.

883
00:54:56,029 --> 00:54:58,331
I envy your father

884
00:54:58,365 --> 00:55:00,032
all his fine friends,
Lady Stark,

885
00:55:00,067 --> 00:55:03,136
but I don't quite see
the purpose of this.

886
00:55:04,938 --> 00:55:07,006
I know your sigil as well--

887
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:10,710
the Twin Towers
of Frey.

888
00:55:10,745 --> 00:55:13,013
How fares your lord, Ser?

889
00:55:13,047 --> 00:55:15,015
Lord Walder is well,
My Lady.

890
00:55:15,049 --> 00:55:17,851
<i>He has asked your father</i>
<i>for the honor of his presence</i>

891
00:55:17,885 --> 00:55:19,453
on his 90th Nameday.

892
00:55:19,487 --> 00:55:21,755
He plans to take another wife.

893
00:55:28,463 --> 00:55:30,932
This man

894
00:55:30,966 --> 00:55:33,301
came into my house
as a guest

895
00:55:33,335 --> 00:55:37,237
and there conspired
to murder my son,

896
00:55:37,272 --> 00:55:40,775
a boy of 10.

897
00:55:42,377 --> 00:55:45,646
In the name of King Robert
and the good lords you serve,

898
00:55:45,681 --> 00:55:48,449
I call upon you
to seize him

899
00:55:48,483 --> 00:55:52,053
and help me return him
to Winterfell

900
00:55:52,087 --> 00:55:54,122
to await the King's Justice.
