3
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:13,034
You need to drink, child.

4
00:02:16,684 --> 00:02:18,885
And eat.

5
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:24,857
Isn't there
anything else?

6
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:28,528
The Dothraki have two things
in abundance:

7
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:32,332
Grass and horses.
People can't live on grass.

8
00:02:41,342 --> 00:02:44,010
<i>In the Shadow Lands</i>
<i>beyond Asshai,</i>

9
00:02:44,044 --> 00:02:46,412
<i>they say there are</i>
<i>fields of ghost grass</i>

10
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,582
with stalks as pale as milk
that glow in the night.

11
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:52,251
It murders
all other grass.

12
00:02:52,286 --> 00:02:54,754
The Dothraki believe
that one day

13
00:02:54,822 --> 00:02:58,024
it will cover everything--
that's the way the world will end.

14
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:13,072
It'll get easier.

15
00:03:51,178 --> 00:03:51,210
Khaleesi!

16
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:54,647
Your hands.

17
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:07,827
We're still not far
from Pentos, your Grace.

18
00:04:07,895 --> 00:04:10,329
Magister Illyrio has
extended his hospitality.

19
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:12,398
You'd be more
comfortable there.

20
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:14,834
I have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.

21
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:17,336
I'll stay with Drogo
until he fulfills

22
00:04:17,371 --> 00:04:19,672
his end of the bargain
and I have my crown.

23
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,075
As you wish, your Grace.

24
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:25,311
Well, Mormont,
as brutish as this life is,

25
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:27,747
I suppose it is preferable
to beheading.

26
00:04:29,283 --> 00:04:31,517
What did Ned Stark
want you for?

27
00:04:31,552 --> 00:04:33,519
Buying from a slaver?

28
00:04:33,587 --> 00:04:36,355
Selling to one--

29
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:38,858
some poachers I caught
on my land.

30
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:43,596
Under my reign, you won't be
punished for such nonsense.

31
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,965
You can rest assured
of that.

32
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:13,559
Better-looking bitches
than you're used to, Uncle.

33
00:05:17,498 --> 00:05:20,099
My mother's been
looking for you.

34
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:22,502
We ride for
King's Landing today.

35
00:05:22,536 --> 00:05:25,638
Before you go, you will call
on Lord and Lady Stark

36
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:27,740
and offer
your sympathies.

37
00:05:27,774 --> 00:05:30,710
What good will
my sympathies do them?

38
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:35,248
None. But it is
expected of you.

39
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:37,383
Your absence has
already been noted.

40
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:39,552
The boy means
nothing to me.

41
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:42,021
And I can't stand
the wailing of women.

42
00:05:44,191 --> 00:05:46,092
One word and I'll
hit you again.

43
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:47,894
I'm telling mother!

44
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:51,364
Go!
Tell her.

45
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:53,499
But first you will get
to Lord and Lady Stark

46
00:05:53,534 --> 00:05:55,535
and you will fall on your knees
in front of them

47
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:58,404
and tell them how very sorry you are,
that you are at their service,

48
00:05:58,438 --> 00:06:01,908
and that all your prayers are with them.
Do you understand?

49
00:06:01,942 --> 00:06:04,110
You can't--

50
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:05,711
Do you understand?

51
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,687
The prince will
remember that, little lord.

52
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:16,722
I hope so.

53
00:06:16,757 --> 00:06:20,259
If he forgets, be a good dog
and remind him.

54
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:26,132
Ah.
Time for breakfast.

55
00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:36,309
Bread.
And two of those little fish.

56
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:39,779
And a mug of dark beer
to wash it down.

57
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:44,417
And bacon,
burned black.

58
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:46,419
Hyah.

59
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:49,455
- Little brother.
- Beloved siblings.

60
00:06:53,827 --> 00:06:55,828
Is Bran going to die?

61
00:06:57,631 --> 00:06:59,732
Apparently not.

62
00:07:01,902 --> 00:07:05,504
- What do you mean?
- The Maester says the boy may live.

63
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,649
It's no mercy, letting a child
linger in such pain.

64
00:07:16,683 --> 00:07:18,451
Only the gods
know for certain.

65
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:21,020
All the rest of us
can do is pray.

66
00:07:22,456 --> 00:07:25,024
The charms of the north
seem entirely lost on you.

67
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:26,993
I still can't believe
you're going.

68
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:29,028
It's ridiculous
even for you.

69
00:07:29,062 --> 00:07:30,796
Where's your sense
of wonder?

70
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:35,034
The greatest structure ever built,
the intrepid men of The Night's Watch,

71
00:07:35,102 --> 00:07:37,637
the wintry abode
of the White Walkers.

72
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:40,606
Tell me you're not thinking
of taking the black.

73
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:43,542
And go celibate?
The whores would go begging

74
00:07:43,577 --> 00:07:45,678
from Dorne to Casterly Rock.

75
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:47,680
No, I just want to stand
on top of the wall

76
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:49,815
and piss off
the edge of the world.

77
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:53,886
The children don't need
to hear your filth.

78
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:57,556
Come.

79
00:08:03,664 --> 00:08:07,077
Even if the boy lives,
he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.

80
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:10,264
Give me a good
clean death any day.

81
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:14,740
Speaking for the grotesques,
I'd have to disagree.

82
00:08:14,808 --> 00:08:18,010
Death is so final,
whereas life...

83
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:20,046
Ah, life is full
of possibilities.

84
00:08:21,448 --> 00:08:22,948
I hope the boy does wake.

85
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:25,584
I'd be very interested
to hear what he has to say.

86
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:29,955
My dear brother,

87
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,658
there are times you make me
wonder whose side you're on.

88
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:35,027
<i>My</i> dear brother,
you wound me.

89
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:37,630
You know how much
I love my family.

90
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,084
Please.

91
00:08:58,118 --> 00:09:01,520
Oh, I would have
dressed, your Grace.

92
00:09:01,555 --> 00:09:04,023
This is your home.
I'm your guest.

93
00:09:07,194 --> 00:09:09,228
Handsome one, isn't he?

94
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:14,066
I lost my first boy,
a little black-haired beauty.

95
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:17,203
He was a fighter too--

96
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:20,573
tried to beat the fever
that took him.

97
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,875
Forgive me.

98
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:24,910
It's the last thing you
need to hear right now.

99
00:09:24,945 --> 00:09:27,179
I never knew.

100
00:09:27,214 --> 00:09:29,048
It was years ago.

101
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:33,586
Robert was crazed, beat
his hands bloody on the wall,

102
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:37,490
all the things men do to show
you how much they care.

103
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:44,563
The boy looked
just like him.

104
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:48,934
Such a little thing...

105
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:51,837
A bird without feathers.

106
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:58,844
They came to take his body away
and Robert held me.

107
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:00,978
I screamed and I battled,
but he held me.

108
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:08,220
That little bundle.

109
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:12,491
They took him away
and I never saw him again.

110
00:10:12,526 --> 00:10:14,860
Never have visited
the crypt, never.

111
00:10:25,472 --> 00:10:27,506
I pray to the mother
every morning and night

112
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,775
that she return
your child to you.

113
00:10:31,745 --> 00:10:33,446
I am grateful.

114
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,549
Perhaps this time
she'll listen.

115
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:29,635
A sword for the wall?

116
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:34,373
- I already have one.
- Good man.

117
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:37,610
- Have you swung it yet?
- Of course I have.

118
00:11:37,644 --> 00:11:39,278
At someone, I mean.

119
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,952
It's a strange thing,
the first time you cut a man.

120
00:11:46,987 --> 00:11:50,155
You realize we're nothing
but sacks of meat

121
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,626
and blood and some bone
to keep it all standing.

122
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:57,997
Let me thank you
ahead of time

123
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:00,866
for guarding us all from
the perils beyond the wall--

124
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:03,502
Wildlings and White Walkers
and whatnot.

125
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,273
We're grateful to have

126
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:09,675
good, strong men like you
protecting us.

127
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:14,980
We've guarded the kingdoms
for 8,000 years.

128
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:20,185
Is it "we" already?

129
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:23,389
Have you taken
your vows then?

130
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,690
Soon enough.

131
00:12:26,993 --> 00:12:29,261
Give my regards
to The Night's Watch.

132
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:32,731
I'm sure it will be thrilling
to serve in such an elite force.

133
00:12:32,766 --> 00:12:34,700
And if not?

134
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:37,603
It's only for life.

135
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:58,357
Thank you, Nymeria.

136
00:13:05,065 --> 00:13:08,033
Septa Mordane says
I have to do it again.

137
00:13:08,068 --> 00:13:10,703
My things weren't
properly folded, she says.

138
00:13:10,737 --> 00:13:12,476
Who cares how they're folded?!

139
00:13:12,477 --> 00:13:13,902
They're going to get all
messed up anyway.

140
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:16,275
It's good
you've got help.

141
00:13:16,276 --> 00:13:18,110
Watch.

142
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:20,045
Nymeria, gloves.

143
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:28,153
- Impressive.
- Shut up.

144
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:30,789
Nymeria, gloves!

145
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,660
I have something for you.

146
00:13:34,694 --> 00:13:37,029
And it has to be packed
very carefully.

147
00:13:37,063 --> 00:13:38,864
A present?

148
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:41,000
Close the door.

149
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,848
This is no toy.

150
00:13:58,485 --> 00:14:01,353
Be careful you don't
cut yourself.

151
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,258
- It's so skinny.
- So are you.

152
00:14:07,494 --> 00:14:09,361
I had the blacksmith
make it for you special.

153
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:10,863
<i>It won't hack</i>
<i>a man's head off,</i>

154
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:13,032
but it can poke him full
of holes if you're quick enough.

155
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,103
I can be quick.

156
00:14:14,128 --> 00:14:15,824
You'll have to work
at it every day.

157
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:18,437
How does it feel?

158
00:14:18,471 --> 00:14:21,140
Do you like
the balance?

159
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:23,342
I think so.

160
00:14:24,711 --> 00:14:27,179
First lesson: Stick them
with the pointy end.

161
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:29,248
I know which end to use.

162
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:36,789
I'm going to miss you.

163
00:14:38,358 --> 00:14:39,792
Careful.

164
00:14:51,004 --> 00:14:53,939
All the best swords
have names, you know.

165
00:14:56,676 --> 00:14:59,311
Sansa can keep
her sewing needles.

166
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,915
I've got a needle
of my own.

167
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,732
I came to say
goodbye to Bran.

168
00:15:19,766 --> 00:15:21,500
You've said it.

169
00:15:32,212 --> 00:15:35,247
I wish I could be here
when you wake up.

170
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:40,753
I'm going north
with Uncle Benjen.

171
00:15:40,787 --> 00:15:42,554
I'm taking the black.

172
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:54,199
I know we always talked about
seeing the wall together,

173
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:58,103
but you'll be able to come visit me
at Castle Black when you're better.

174
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:02,274
I'll know my way
around by then.

175
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:05,077
I'll be a sworn brother
of The Night's Watch.

176
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,185
We can go out walking beyond the wall,
if you're not afraid.

177
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:30,035
I want you

178
00:16:30,103 --> 00:16:31,703
to leave.

179
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,199
17 years ago

180
00:17:34,234 --> 00:17:36,401
you rode off
with Robert Baratheon.

181
00:17:38,605 --> 00:17:41,940
You came back a year later with
another woman's son.

182
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:46,111
And now
you're leaving again.

183
00:17:48,781 --> 00:17:50,549
I have no choice.

184
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:54,453
That's what men always say
when honor calls.

185
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:58,056
That's what you tell your families,
tell yourselves.

186
00:17:59,626 --> 00:18:01,960
You do have a choice.

187
00:18:01,995 --> 00:18:04,763
And you've made it.

188
00:18:07,901 --> 00:18:09,935
Cat--

189
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:18,310
I can't do it, Ned.

190
00:18:21,281 --> 00:18:24,483
- I really can't.
- You can.

191
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:28,587
You must.

192
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:54,546
You've said
goodbye to Bran?

193
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,015
He's not going to die.
I know it.

194
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,351
You Starks
are hard to kill.

195
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:01,954
My mother?

196
00:19:01,988 --> 00:19:04,456
- She was very kind.
- Good.

197
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:08,460
Next time I see you,
you'll be all in black.

198
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:10,662
It was always my color.

199
00:19:11,864 --> 00:19:15,000
- Farewell, Snow.
- And you, Stark.

200
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:09,988
There's great honor serving
in The Night's Watch.

201
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:15,460
<i>The Starks have manned the wall</i>
<i>for thousands of years.</i>

202
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:18,463
And you are a Stark.

203
00:20:18,498 --> 00:20:20,732
You might not have my name,

204
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,901
but you have my blood.

205
00:20:29,242 --> 00:20:31,643
Is my mother alive?

206
00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:34,880
Does she know about me?
Where I am, where I'm going?

207
00:20:36,482 --> 00:20:38,583
Does she care?

208
00:20:39,752 --> 00:20:42,054
The next time
we see each other,

209
00:20:42,088 --> 00:20:44,423
we'll talk
about your mother.

210
00:20:44,457 --> 00:20:46,324
Huh?

211
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:48,427
I promise.

212
00:21:28,034 --> 00:21:31,036
Gods, this is country!

213
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:36,374
I've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.

214
00:21:38,511 --> 00:21:40,812
I've half a mind
to go with you.

215
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:42,881
What do you say,
just you and me

216
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:45,450
on the Kingsroad,
swords at our sides,

217
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:49,054
a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.

218
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:51,756
You should have
asked me 20 years ago.

219
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,659
There were wars to fight,
women to marry--

220
00:21:54,694 --> 00:21:56,761
we never had the chance
to be young.

221
00:21:56,796 --> 00:21:58,797
I recall
a few chances.

222
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:05,337
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?

223
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:07,339
That common girl of yours?

224
00:22:07,373 --> 00:22:10,175
Becca? With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.

225
00:22:10,243 --> 00:22:12,544
Bessie.
She was one of yours.

226
00:22:12,578 --> 00:22:16,214
Bessie!
Thank the gods for Bessie

227
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:19,084
and her tits.

228
00:22:19,118 --> 00:22:21,520
Yours was... Aleena?

229
00:22:21,554 --> 00:22:24,623
No. You told me once.
Meryl?

230
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:26,691
Your bastard's mother?

231
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:30,595
- Wylla.
- <i>That's it.</i>

232
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,797
<i>She must have been</i>
<i>a rare wench</i>

233
00:22:32,832 --> 00:22:35,667
to make Lord Eddard Stark
forget his honor.

234
00:22:35,701 --> 00:22:37,936
You never told me
what she looked like.

235
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,338
Nor will I.

236
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:44,676
We were at war.

237
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,379
<i>None of us knew if we were</i>
<i>gonna go back home again.</i>

238
00:22:47,413 --> 00:22:50,882
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.

239
00:22:52,785 --> 00:22:55,987
I swear if I weren't your King,
you'd have hit me already.

240
00:22:56,022 --> 00:22:59,057
The worst thing
about your coronation--

241
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,660
I'll never get
to hit you again.

242
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:06,398
Trust me, that's not
the worst thing.

243
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:12,404
There was a rider
in the night.

244
00:23:18,477 --> 00:23:21,980
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

245
00:23:22,014 --> 00:23:24,683
What of it?
Should we send her a wedding gift?

246
00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:26,418
A knife perhaps,
a good sharp one,

247
00:23:26,452 --> 00:23:28,386
and a bold man to wield it.

248
00:23:28,454 --> 00:23:30,388
She's little more
than a child.

249
00:23:30,423 --> 00:23:33,658
Soon enough that child will spread
her legs and start breeding.

250
00:23:33,693 --> 00:23:37,362
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

251
00:23:37,396 --> 00:23:41,266
<i>What her father did to your family--</i>
<i>that was unspeakable.</i>

252
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,368
What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister--

253
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:45,537
<i>the woman I loved.</i>

254
00:23:45,571 --> 00:23:48,840
I'll kill every Targaryen
I get my hands on.

255
00:23:48,874 --> 00:23:51,076
But you can't get
your hands on this one, can you?

256
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,044
This Khal Drogo,

257
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:55,413
it's said he has 100,000 men
in his horde.

258
00:23:55,448 --> 00:23:58,216
Even a million Dothraki
are no threat to the realm,

259
00:23:58,251 --> 00:24:01,052
as long as they remain on the
other side of the Narrow Sea.

260
00:24:01,087 --> 00:24:03,054
They have no ships,
Robert.

261
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:06,258
There are still those in the
Seven Kingdoms who call me usurper.

262
00:24:07,793 --> 00:24:11,062
If the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back,

263
00:24:11,097 --> 00:24:13,898
- the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.

264
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:18,770
And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.

265
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:25,644
There's a war coming, Ned.

266
00:24:25,678 --> 00:24:27,512
<i>I don't know when,</i>

267
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:30,081
I don't know who
we'll be fighting,

268
00:24:30,116 --> 00:24:31,616
but it's coming.

269
00:25:43,356 --> 00:25:45,256
Sit.

270
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:47,292
You'll be fed.

271
00:25:50,596 --> 00:25:52,964
<i>Untie them.</i>

272
00:25:52,998 --> 00:25:56,468
Ah, rapers.

273
00:25:58,504 --> 00:26:02,307
They were given a choice no doubt--
castration or the wall.

274
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:04,776
Most choose the knife.

275
00:26:09,415 --> 00:26:12,317
Not impressed
by your new brothers?

276
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,955
<i>Lovely thing</i>
<i>about the watch--</i>

277
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:20,492
you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.

278
00:26:29,168 --> 00:26:31,336
Why do you read so much?

279
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,639
Look at me and tell me
what you see.

280
00:26:35,808 --> 00:26:37,675
Is this a trick?

281
00:26:37,743 --> 00:26:41,446
What you see is a dwarf.

282
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,916
If I'd been born a peasant they might've
left me out in the woods to die.

283
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,753
Alas, I was born a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

284
00:26:48,788 --> 00:26:51,322
Things are expected of me.

285
00:26:51,357 --> 00:26:53,792
My father was the Hand
of the King for 20 years.

286
00:26:53,826 --> 00:26:56,027
Until your brother
killed that King.

287
00:27:01,534 --> 00:27:05,503
Yes, until my brother
killed him.

288
00:27:07,406 --> 00:27:10,041
<i>Life is full of these</i>
<i>little ironies.</i>

289
00:27:11,243 --> 00:27:13,211
My sister married
the new King

290
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:16,448
and my repulsive nephew
will be King after him.

291
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:22,353
I must do my part for the honor
of my house, wouldn't you agree?

292
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:25,990
<i>But how?</i>

293
00:27:26,025 --> 00:27:28,827
Well, my brother
has his sword

294
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:30,728
and I have my mind.

295
00:27:30,796 --> 00:27:34,098
And a mind needs books
like a sword needs a whetstone.

296
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:37,235
That's why I read
so much, Jon Snow.

297
00:27:40,573 --> 00:27:43,041
And you?

298
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:45,410
What's your story,
bastard?

299
00:27:47,613 --> 00:27:50,615
Ask me nicely and maybe
I'll tell you, dwarf.

300
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:57,355
A bastard boy
with nothing to inherit,

301
00:27:57,389 --> 00:27:59,324
<i>off to join</i>

302
00:27:59,358 --> 00:28:01,826
<i>the ancient order</i>
<i>of The Night's Watch,</i>

303
00:28:01,861 --> 00:28:05,830
alongside his Valiant
brothers-in-arms.

304
00:28:05,865 --> 00:28:07,932
The Night's Watch protects
the realm from--

305
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:11,202
ah, yes yes, against grumpkins
and snarks

306
00:28:11,237 --> 00:28:14,672
and all the other monsters
your wet nurse warned you about.

307
00:28:14,707 --> 00:28:17,075
<i>You're a smart boy.</i>

308
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:19,711
You don't believe
that nonsense.

309
00:28:27,052 --> 00:28:30,188
Everything's better
with some wine in the belly.

310
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:08,459
It's time we reviewed
the accounts, my lady.

311
00:29:08,527 --> 00:29:12,630
You'll want to know how much
this royal visit has cost us.

312
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:16,801
Talk to Poole about it.

313
00:29:18,137 --> 00:29:21,239
Poole went south
with Lord Stark, my lady.

314
00:29:21,273 --> 00:29:23,975
<i>We need a new steward,</i>

315
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:27,178
and there are several other
appointments that require

316
00:29:27,212 --> 00:29:31,316
- our immediate attention--
- I don't care about appointments!

317
00:29:32,618 --> 00:29:34,485
I'll make the appointments.

318
00:29:37,222 --> 00:29:39,137
We'll talk about it
first thing in the morning.

319
00:29:39,162 --> 00:29:41,362
Very good, my Lord.

320
00:29:43,596 --> 00:29:45,229
My Lady.

321
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,311
When was the last time
you left this room?

322
00:30:00,346 --> 00:30:02,981
I have to take care
of him.

323
00:30:03,015 --> 00:30:04,882
He's not going
to die, mother.

324
00:30:04,883 --> 00:30:07,094
Maester Luwin says the most
dangerous time has passed.

325
00:30:07,095 --> 00:30:08,461
<i>What if he's wrong?</i>

326
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:12,261
- Bran needs me.
- <i>Rickon needs you.</i>

327
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:14,258
He's six.

328
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:17,695
He doesn't know what's happening.
He follows me around all day,

329
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:20,164
- clutching my leg, crying--
- close the windows!

330
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:22,367
I can't stand it!
Please make them stop!

331
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:28,573
Fire.

332
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:30,775
You stay here.
I'll come back.

333
00:30:48,494 --> 00:30:50,995
You're not supposed
to be here.

334
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,731
No one is
supposed to be here.

335
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:57,368
It's a mercy.
He's dead already.

336
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:02,740
No!

337
00:32:08,474 --> 00:32:12,243
- Have you ever seen a dragon?
- Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

338
00:32:12,277 --> 00:32:15,313
<i>Everywhere?</i>
<i>Even in the east?</i>

339
00:32:15,347 --> 00:32:18,282
<i>No dragon.</i>
<i>Brave men kill them.</i>

340
00:32:18,317 --> 00:32:21,519
- <i>It is known.</i>
- It is known.

341
00:32:21,553 --> 00:32:25,590
A trader from Garth told me
that dragons come from the moon.

342
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:27,959
The moon?

343
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:30,194
He told me the moon
was an egg, Khaleesi,

344
00:32:30,229 --> 00:32:33,264
<i>that once there were</i>
<i>two moons in the sky.</i>

345
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:37,135
But one wandered too close
to the sun and it cracked from the heat.

346
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:40,404
Out of it poured a thousand
thousand dragons

347
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:42,373
and they drank
the sun's fire.

348
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:45,309
Moon is no egg.

349
00:32:45,344 --> 00:32:48,179
Moon is goddess--
wife of sun.

350
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:50,982
- It is known.
- It is known.

351
00:32:52,518 --> 00:32:54,485
Leave me with her.

352
00:33:02,327 --> 00:33:05,596
Why did the trader from Garth
tell you these stories?

353
00:33:05,631 --> 00:33:08,833
Men like to talk
when they're happy.

354
00:33:08,867 --> 00:33:10,902
Before your brother
bought me for you,

355
00:33:10,936 --> 00:33:13,004
it was my job
to make men happy.

356
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:16,240
- How old were you?
- I was nine

357
00:33:16,275 --> 00:33:18,276
when my mother sold me
to the pleasure house.

358
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,811
Nine?!

359
00:33:19,845 --> 00:33:23,281
I did not touch a man
for three years, Khaleesi.

360
00:33:23,315 --> 00:33:24,849
First

361
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:26,851
you must learn.

362
00:33:29,688 --> 00:33:33,191
Can you teach me how
to make the Khal happy?

363
00:33:34,393 --> 00:33:38,296
- Yes.
- Will it take three years?

364
00:33:39,698 --> 00:33:41,365
No.

365
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:05,022
Welcome.

366
00:35:35,414 --> 00:35:38,983
What I am about to tell
you must remain between us.

367
00:35:40,485 --> 00:35:43,120
I don't think Bran
fell from that tower.

368
00:35:44,323 --> 00:35:46,324
I think he was thrown.

369
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:50,428
The boy was always
sure-footed before.

370
00:35:50,462 --> 00:35:53,197
Someone tried
to kill him twice.

371
00:35:53,231 --> 00:35:56,334
<i>Why?</i>
<i>Why murder an innocent child?</i>

372
00:35:56,368 --> 00:35:59,103
Unless he saw something
he wasn't meant to see.

373
00:35:59,137 --> 00:36:01,839
- Saw what, my lady?
- I don't know.

374
00:36:03,408 --> 00:36:05,643
<i>But I would stake my life</i>
<i>the Lannisters are involved.</i>

375
00:36:05,677 --> 00:36:09,113
We already have reason
to suspect their loyalty to the crown.

376
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:11,449
Did you notice the dagger
the killer used?

377
00:36:11,483 --> 00:36:13,918
It's too fine a weapon
for such a man.

378
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:17,254
The blade is Valyrian steel,
the handle dragonbone.

379
00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:19,190
Someone gave it to him.

380
00:36:20,592 --> 00:36:24,128
They come into our home
and try to murder my brother?

381
00:36:24,162 --> 00:36:26,383
If it's war they want--

382
00:36:26,408 --> 00:36:28,096
If it comes to that, you know
I'll stand behind you.

383
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,968
What, is there going to be
a battle in the Godswood?

384
00:36:31,003 --> 00:36:32,970
<i>Huh?</i>

385
00:36:33,005 --> 00:36:35,973
Too easily words of war
become acts of war.

386
00:36:36,008 --> 00:36:38,042
<i>We don't know</i>
<i>the truth yet.</i>

387
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,644
Lord Stark
must be told of this.

388
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:43,614
I don't trust a raven
to carry these words.

389
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,549
- I'll ride to King's Landing.
- No.

390
00:36:45,584 --> 00:36:48,886
There must always be
a Stark in Winterfell.

391
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,222
- I will go myself.
- Mother, you can't.

392
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:53,424
I must.

393
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:56,160
I'll send hal with a squad
of guardsmen to escort you.

394
00:36:56,194 --> 00:36:58,696
Too large a party attracts
unwanted attention.

395
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,032
I don't want the Lannisters
to know I'm coming.

396
00:37:01,066 --> 00:37:02,900
Let me accompany you
at least.

397
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:05,836
<i>The Kingsroad can be a</i>
<i>dangerous place for a woman alone.</i>

398
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:11,909
What about Bran?

399
00:37:13,445 --> 00:37:16,547
I have prayed to the seven
for more than a month.

400
00:37:17,716 --> 00:37:21,085
<i>Bran's life is</i>
<i>in their hands now.</i>

401
00:38:19,778 --> 00:38:22,046
No, Khaleesi.

402
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,882
You must look
in his eyes always.

403
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:26,951
Love comes in at the eyes.

404
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:31,422
It is said that Irogenia of Lys
could finish a man

405
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:33,491
with nothing
but her eyes.

406
00:38:33,525 --> 00:38:35,826
Finish a man?

407
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:39,430
Oh.

408
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:44,001
Kings traveled across
the world for a night with Irogenia.

409
00:38:44,035 --> 00:38:46,670
Magisters sold
their palaces.

410
00:38:46,705 --> 00:38:50,441
<i>Khals burned her enemies</i>
<i>just to have her for a few hours.</i>

411
00:38:50,475 --> 00:38:54,245
They say a thousand men
proposed to her

412
00:38:54,279 --> 00:38:57,114
and she refused them all.

413
00:38:57,149 --> 00:39:00,718
Well, she sounds like
an interesting woman.

414
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:02,686
I-- I don't think

415
00:39:02,721 --> 00:39:04,989
that Drogo will like it
with me on top.

416
00:39:05,023 --> 00:39:07,525
You will make him
like it, Khaleesi.

417
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:09,793
Men want what
they've never had.

418
00:39:09,828 --> 00:39:13,030
And the Dothraki take slaves
like a hound takes a bitch.

419
00:39:13,064 --> 00:39:16,534
Are you a slave,
Khaleesi?

420
00:39:27,145 --> 00:39:30,014
Then don't make love
like a slave.

421
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,758
Very good, Khaleesi.

422
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:42,960
Out there
he is the mighty Khal,

423
00:39:42,994 --> 00:39:47,064
<i>but in this tent,</i>
<i>he belongs to you.</i>

424
00:39:47,098 --> 00:39:49,333
I-- I don't think

425
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:51,435
that this is
the Dothraki way.

426
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:54,038
If he wanted
the Dothraki way,

427
00:39:54,072 --> 00:39:57,074
why did he marry you?

428
00:40:45,523 --> 00:40:48,392
No.

429
00:40:50,795 --> 00:40:52,696
No!

430
00:40:52,731 --> 00:40:57,401
<i>Ajjalan anha zalat</i>
<i>vitiherat yer hatif.</i>

431
00:42:43,842 --> 00:42:45,676
Pardon me, Ser.

432
00:42:49,514 --> 00:42:51,849
Do I frighten you
so much, girl?

433
00:42:53,551 --> 00:42:56,320
Or is it him there
making you shake?

434
00:42:56,354 --> 00:42:58,956
He frightens
me too.

435
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,458
Look at
that face.

436
00:43:01,493 --> 00:43:04,261
I'm sorry
if I offended you, Ser.

437
00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:12,837
Why won't he speak to me?

438
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:15,038
He hasn't been very talkative
these last 20 years.

439
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:18,108
Since the mad King had his tongue
ripped out with hot pincers.

440
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,878
He speaks damn well
with his sword though.

441
00:43:20,912 --> 00:43:24,681
Ser Ilyn Payne,
the King's justice.

442
00:43:26,184 --> 00:43:28,318
The royal
executioner.

443
00:43:29,621 --> 00:43:32,790
What is it, sweet lady?

444
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:36,427
Does the hound frighten you?

445
00:43:36,461 --> 00:43:38,162
Away with you, dog.

446
00:43:38,196 --> 00:43:40,864
You're scaring
my lady.

447
00:43:43,067 --> 00:43:45,202
I don't like
to see you upset.

448
00:43:47,705 --> 00:43:49,506
The Sun is finally shining.

449
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:51,308
Come walk with me.

450
00:43:53,244 --> 00:43:55,379
Stay, lady.

451
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:14,231
I probably shouldn't
have any more.

452
00:44:14,265 --> 00:44:16,633
Father only lets us
have one cup at feasts.

453
00:44:16,668 --> 00:44:19,736
My princess can drink
as much as she wants.

454
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:34,918
Don't worry--
you're safe with me.

455
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,021
I'll get you!

456
00:44:43,194 --> 00:44:46,129
- Arya!
- Ow!

457
00:44:46,164 --> 00:44:47,731
What are you doing here?

458
00:44:47,765 --> 00:44:50,234
- Go away.
- Your sister?

459
00:44:53,972 --> 00:44:56,773
- And who are you, boy?
- Mycah, my Lord.

460
00:44:56,808 --> 00:44:58,909
- He the butcher's boy.
- He's my friend.

461
00:44:58,943 --> 00:45:02,412
A butcher's boy who wants
to be a Knight, eh?

462
00:45:04,015 --> 00:45:06,850
Pick up your sword, butcher's boy.
Let's see how good you are.

463
00:45:06,885 --> 00:45:09,486
She asked me to, my Lord.
She asked me to.

464
00:45:09,521 --> 00:45:11,488
I'm your prince,

465
00:45:11,523 --> 00:45:13,457
not your lord,

466
00:45:13,491 --> 00:45:17,094
and I said pick up
your sword.

467
00:45:17,161 --> 00:45:19,496
It's not a sword, my prince.
It's only a stick.

468
00:45:19,531 --> 00:45:21,398
And you're not a Knight.

469
00:45:22,734 --> 00:45:24,968
Only a butcher's boy.

470
00:45:25,003 --> 00:45:28,038
That was my lady's sister
you were hitting, do you know that?

471
00:45:28,072 --> 00:45:30,407
- Stop it!
- Arya, stay out of this.

472
00:45:31,342 --> 00:45:33,110
I won't hurt him...

473
00:45:33,144 --> 00:45:34,745
Much.

474
00:45:43,254 --> 00:45:44,521
Arya!

475
00:45:45,523 --> 00:45:46,924
Filthy little bitch!

476
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:48,859
No no, stop it, stop it,
both of you.

477
00:45:48,893 --> 00:45:52,229
You're spoiling it.
You're spoiling everything!

478
00:45:52,263 --> 00:45:54,898
I'll gut you,
you little cunt!

479
00:45:57,602 --> 00:45:59,703
- Arya!
- Nymeria!

480
00:45:59,737 --> 00:46:02,306
- Arya!
- Nymeria!

481
00:46:07,178 --> 00:46:09,112
No.

482
00:46:09,147 --> 00:46:11,748
No.
Please don't.

483
00:46:11,783 --> 00:46:14,217
Arya, leave him alone.

484
00:46:32,804 --> 00:46:36,273
My prince, my poor prince,
look what they did to you.

485
00:46:36,307 --> 00:46:38,742
Stay here, I'll go back
to the inn and bring help.

486
00:46:38,776 --> 00:46:40,110
Then go!

487
00:46:41,913 --> 00:46:44,348
Don't touch me.

488
00:46:46,351 --> 00:46:49,319
<i>The wolf's not here.
Look down by the stream.</i>

489
00:46:55,326 --> 00:46:59,296
You've got to go. They'll kill you for
what you did to Joffrey.

490
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:01,465
Go on-- run.

491
00:47:04,569 --> 00:47:06,737
Go!
Leave now!

492
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,308
- <i>It's a direwolf.</i>
- <i>I'll check down here.</i>

493
00:47:16,881 --> 00:47:20,484
<i>I think I heard a noise.</i>

494
00:47:22,053 --> 00:47:23,687
<i>Go!</i>

495
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:38,802
<i>Arya!</i>

496
00:47:38,836 --> 00:47:43,540
- Distant man: <i>Arya!</i>
- Ned: <i>Arya!</i>

497
00:47:43,574 --> 00:47:46,476
<i>Arya-aa!</i>

498
00:47:47,612 --> 00:47:49,680
Arya!

499
00:47:49,714 --> 00:47:51,448
<i>Arya!</i>

500
00:47:51,482 --> 00:47:53,417
My lord!

501
00:47:53,451 --> 00:47:55,852
My lord!
They found her.

502
00:47:55,887 --> 00:47:58,355
She's unharmed.

503
00:47:58,389 --> 00:47:59,907
Where is she?

504
00:47:59,932 --> 00:48:01,658
She's been taken
directly before the King.

505
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:03,547
- Who took her?
- The Lannisters found her.

506
00:48:03,823 --> 00:48:05,991
- <i>Arya-aa!</i>
- Right, get back.

507
00:48:06,061 --> 00:48:08,441
<i>The Queen ordered</i>
<i>them to bring her straight to him.</i>

508
00:48:08,662 --> 00:48:10,897
Back!
Back to the inn.

509
00:48:11,102 --> 00:48:12,969
All back!

510
00:48:20,611 --> 00:48:22,479
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

511
00:48:22,513 --> 00:48:24,247
<i>- Are you hurt?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

512
00:48:24,282 --> 00:48:26,817
Oh, it's all right.

513
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:31,254
What is
the meaning of this?

514
00:48:31,322 --> 00:48:34,041
Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?

515
00:48:34,415 --> 00:48:36,055
How dare you speak
to your King in that manner?

516
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,280
Quiet, woman.

517
00:48:38,229 --> 00:48:41,131
Sorry, Ned.
I never meant to frighten the girl.

518
00:48:41,165 --> 00:48:43,433
But we need to get
this business done quickly.

519
00:48:43,501 --> 00:48:47,070
Your girl and that butcher's boy
attacked my son.

520
00:48:47,105 --> 00:48:49,740
That animal of hers
nearly tore his arm off.

521
00:48:49,774 --> 00:48:51,708
That's not true!

522
00:48:51,743 --> 00:48:54,211
She just...
Bit him a little.

523
00:48:54,245 --> 00:48:57,848
- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joff told us what happened.

524
00:48:57,882 --> 00:48:59,783
You and that boy
beat him with clubs

525
00:48:59,817 --> 00:49:02,686
- while you set your wolf on him.
- That's not what happened!

526
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,346
Yes it is!

527
00:49:04,371 --> 00:49:06,121
They all attacked me and she
threw my sword in the river.

528
00:49:06,124 --> 00:49:07,390
- Liar!
- Shut up!

529
00:49:07,425 --> 00:49:08,825
<i>Enough!</i>

530
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,895
He tells me one thing,
she tells me another.

531
00:49:11,929 --> 00:49:14,297
Seven hells!
What am I to make of this?

532
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:18,425
Where's your
other daughter, Ned?

533
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:19,802
In bed asleep.

534
00:49:20,265 --> 00:49:21,566
She's not.

535
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:24,793
Sansa, come here, darling.

536
00:49:34,752 --> 00:49:36,753
Now, child...

537
00:49:37,655 --> 00:49:39,723
Tell me what happened.

538
00:49:39,757 --> 00:49:41,825
Tell it all
and tell it true.

539
00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:44,494
It's a great crime
to lie to a King.

540
00:49:52,904 --> 00:49:54,838
I don't know.

541
00:49:54,872 --> 00:49:58,308
I don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.

542
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:01,678
- I didn't see.
- Liar!

543
00:50:01,712 --> 00:50:03,180
- Liar liar liar!
- Arya!

544
00:50:03,214 --> 00:50:05,515
- Hey, stop it! That's enough of that.
- Liar liar liar!

545
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:09,911
- Stop! Arya!
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.

546
00:50:09,988 --> 00:50:11,009
<i>I want her punished.</i>

547
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:13,742
What would you have me do,
whip her through the streets?

548
00:50:14,264 --> 00:50:16,966
Damn it, children fight.
It's over.

549
00:50:17,002 --> 00:50:19,604
Joffrey will bear these scars
for the rest of his life.

550
00:50:21,273 --> 00:50:24,909
You let that
little girl disarm you?

551
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:34,052
Ned, see to it that
your daughter is disciplined.

552
00:50:34,086 --> 00:50:36,955
- I'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, your Grace.

553
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:40,825
And what of the direwolf?

554
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:43,461
What of the beast
that savaged your son?

555
00:50:46,332 --> 00:50:48,833
I'd forgot
the damned wolf.

556
00:50:48,868 --> 00:50:51,636
We found no trace
of the direwolf, your Grace.

557
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:54,939
No?
So be it.

558
00:50:54,974 --> 00:50:57,142
We have another wolf.

559
00:51:00,446 --> 00:51:02,080
As you will.

560
00:51:02,114 --> 00:51:05,316
- You can't mean it.
- A direwolf's no pet.

561
00:51:05,351 --> 00:51:07,786
Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.

562
00:51:08,921 --> 00:51:11,289
He doesn't mean Lady,
does he?

563
00:51:11,323 --> 00:51:14,325
No no, not lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!

564
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,261
- She's good!
- Lady wasn't there!

565
00:51:16,295 --> 00:51:19,664
- <i>You leave her alone!</i>
- Stop them. Don't let them do it.

566
00:51:19,732 --> 00:51:22,467
Please please,
it wasn't Lady!

567
00:51:22,501 --> 00:51:24,002
Is this your command--

568
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:26,604
your Grace?

569
00:51:33,012 --> 00:51:36,548
- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, your Grace.

570
00:51:36,582 --> 00:51:38,750
Ser Ilyn,
do me the honor.

571
00:51:38,784 --> 00:51:41,085
No.

572
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,488
Jory...

573
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:46,624
Take the girls
to their rooms.

574
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:53,431
If it must be done,

575
00:51:53,465 --> 00:51:55,433
then I'll do it myself.

576
00:51:55,467 --> 00:51:57,669
Is this some trick?

577
00:51:57,703 --> 00:52:00,638
The wolf is of the north.

578
00:52:00,673 --> 00:52:03,775
She deserves better
than a butcher.

579
00:52:37,142 --> 00:52:39,077
The butcher's boy--

580
00:52:39,144 --> 00:52:40,812
you rode him down?

581
00:52:40,846 --> 00:52:42,981
He ran...

582
00:52:43,015 --> 00:52:44,716
Not very fast.

583
