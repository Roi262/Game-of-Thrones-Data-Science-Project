we're losing the war?

<i>Landing with my peace terms.</i>

22
00:00:53,307 --> 00:00:55,274
You think my father's going
to negotiate with you?

23
00:00:55,309 --> 00:00:56,775
You don't know him
very well.

24
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,044
We won't beat them until
you take King's Landing.

25
00:00:59,078 --> 00:01:01,280
And we can't take
King's Landing without ships.

26
00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:03,815
My father has ships
and men who know how to sail.

27

Men who fought
my father.

28
00:01:05,652 --> 00:01:08,187
I'm his only living son.
He'll listen to me.

29
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:10,856
You don't want
Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

30
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:13,559
- I need his ships.
- He is not trustworthy.

31
00:01:13,594 --> 00:01:16,362
I heard a disgusting lie
about Uncle Jaime and you.

32
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:18,797
- Father had other children.
- What are you asking?

no courtesy.

You're called Arry?

55

Beer, you little shit.

58

Get us beer!

59
00:04:37,322 --> 00:04:39,090
You should have
asked nicely.

Aah!

61
00:04:44,897 --> 00:04:47,500
Come closer
and I'll shove that stick

62
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:50,203
up your bunghole
and fuck you bloody.

63
00:04:50,237 --> 00:04:52,772
A boy has more courage
than sense.

64
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:54,374
Come here!

65
00:04:54,408 --> 00:04:56,109
Yoren said none of us
were to go near those three.

66
00:04:56,143 --> 00:04:58,211
- Come here!
- They don't scare me.

67
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:00,313
Hmm?
Then you're stupid.

68
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:02,215
They scare me.

69
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:09,321
What are Gold Cloaks doing so
far from King's Landing?

70
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:16,994
- What are you doing?
- They're looking for me.

71
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:19,930
You in command here?

72
00:05:19,965 --> 00:05:22,900
You're a long way
from home.

73
00:05:22,935 --> 00:05:25,036
I asked you a question.

74
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,838
Aye, you did.

75
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,942
You asked
without manners

76
00:05:29,976 --> 00:05:32,545
and I chose not to answer.

77
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,615
I have a royal warrant

78
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,286
for one of these gutter rats
you're transporting.

79
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:44,792
Well, the thing is...

80
00:05:44,826 --> 00:05:47,094
These gutter rats belong
to the Night's Watch.

81
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:50,898
<i>Now, that puts them beyond the</i>
<i>reach of Kings and Queens.</i>

82
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,767
Does it?

83
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:55,169
<i>It's a funny thing--</i>

84
00:05:55,203 --> 00:05:57,338
people worry so much
about their throats

85
00:05:57,373 --> 00:06:00,742
that they forget
about what's down low.

86
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:04,980
Now I sharpened this blade
before breakfast.

87
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:09,384
I could shave a spider's arse
if I wanted to

88
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,389
or I could nick
this artery in your leg.

89
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,992
And once it's nicked,
there's no one around here

90
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:19,095
who knows
how to unnick it.

91
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:21,931
We'll just keep that.

92
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,970
Good steel is always
needed on the Wall.

93
00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:28,704
Seems you have
a choice--

94
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:32,942
you can die here at this crossroads
a long way from home,

95
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,811
or you can go back to your city
and tell your Masters

96
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:38,847
you didn't find
what you were looking for.

97
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:46,689
We're looking
for a boy named Gendry.

98
00:06:46,724 --> 00:06:50,293
<i>He carries</i>
<i>a bull's head helmet.</i>

99
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:54,331
<i>Anyone turning him over</i>
<i>will earn the King's reward.</i>

100
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:57,334
We'll be back
with more men

101
00:06:57,368 --> 00:07:00,203
and I'll be taking your head
home along with that bastard boy.

102
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:31,833
- <i>( Distant seagulls</i>

103
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:37,306
My Lord.

104
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,307
You make me wait
a long time,

105
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:41,577
but your friend
keeps me company.

106
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:44,680
We were just speaking
of your bravery

107
00:07:44,713 --> 00:07:48,116
in the victory against
the Stark auxiliary forces.

108
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:51,553
It was quite a battle.

109
00:07:51,587 --> 00:07:55,056
I heard you suffered
a terrible head wound.

110
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:58,026
The northerners
are such fearsome warriors.

111
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,663
And I tell him
the story of how we meet.

112
00:08:01,665 --> 00:08:03,732
To find so lovely
a creature

113
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:05,568
working in your
father's kitchens--

114
00:08:05,602 --> 00:08:07,837
it almost beggars belief.

115
00:08:08,973 --> 00:08:10,908
Strange things do happen.

116
00:08:10,942 --> 00:08:13,711
You should taste
her fish pie.

117
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:16,080
I don't think Lord Varys
likes fish pie.

118
00:08:16,114 --> 00:08:19,083
- How can you tell?
- I can always tell.

119
00:08:19,118 --> 00:08:21,319
<i>Men like Lord Varys</i>
<i>and I can't let</i>

120
00:08:21,353 --> 00:08:23,521
our disadvantages
get the best of us.

121
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:26,423
We'll make a fisherman
of him yet.

122
00:08:26,457 --> 00:08:28,324
I am glad
your new friend

123
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:31,460
was able to accompany you
to the capital.

124
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:35,564
Friends are such
an important part of life.

125
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,066
Unfortunate that your father
didn't want her to come.

126
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,635
<i>But rest easy, My Lord.</i>

127
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,639
I am very good
at keeping secrets

128
00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:45,874
for my good friends.

129
00:08:45,908 --> 00:08:48,377
Your discretion
is legendary...

130
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:49,811
where your friends
are concerned.

131
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:52,314
How unspeakable of me
to go on and on

132
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:54,583
when all you want
to do is rest.

133
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,752
I will leave you.

134
00:08:58,155 --> 00:08:59,922
Welcome to King's Landing,
my dear.

135
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:03,393
This city is made brighter
by your presence.

136
00:09:03,427 --> 00:09:05,762
We have a council meeting,
My Lord.

137
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,601
I don't like threats.

138
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:13,904
- Who threatened you?
- I'm not Ned Stark.

139
00:09:13,938 --> 00:09:16,072
I understand the way
this game is played.

140
00:09:16,107 --> 00:09:17,707
Ned Stark
was a man of honor.

141
00:09:17,742 --> 00:09:19,175
And I am not.

142
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,712
Threaten me again and I'll have
you thrown into the sea.

143
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,151
You might be disappointed
in the results.

144
00:09:28,185 --> 00:09:31,154
Storms come and go,

145
00:09:31,188 --> 00:09:33,356
the big fish eat
the little fish,

146
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,425
and I keep on paddling.

147
00:09:37,461 --> 00:09:38,861
Come, My Lord.

148
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:41,263
We shouldn't keep
the queen waiting.

149
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:49,303
<i>"From this time</i>
<i>until the end of time,</i>

150
00:09:49,337 --> 00:09:51,171
<i>we are not part</i>
<i>of your realm,</i>

152
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:01,280
He has more spirit than
his father, I'll give him that.

153
00:10:01,314 --> 00:10:04,617
You've perfected the art
of tearing up papers.

154
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:07,153
We can give him his father's bones
back at least

155
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:08,888
as a gesture
of good faith.

156
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:10,957
You'll give the Starks
our reply, cousin?

157
00:10:11,892 --> 00:10:14,060
I will, Your Grace.

158
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:15,696
Did you see my brother

159
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,131
when you were
the Starks' guest?

160
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:19,066
<i>I did.</i>

161
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:21,802
<i>They have not broken</i>
<i>his spirit, Your Grace.</i>

162
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:25,539
If you speak with him,

163
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:28,475
tell him he's not
been forgotten.

164
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,844
- I will, Your Grace.
- Safe travels, cousin.

165
00:10:35,183 --> 00:10:37,484
You have a deft hand
with diplomacy.

166
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,755
- If that's everything...
- A-- a raven flew in this morning

167
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:44,658
from Castle Black.

168
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:46,293
Trouble with
the wildlings.

169
00:10:46,327 --> 00:10:48,795
That's why they're
called "wildlings."

170
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,464
Somewhat less wild
these days.

171
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:53,300
Seems they've stopped
killing each other

172
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:56,437
and started following
this King-Beyond-the-Wall.

173
00:10:56,471 --> 00:10:59,273
Another king?
How many is that now, five?

174
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:01,075
I've lost count.

175
00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:04,912
The Lord Commander asks that we
send more men to man the Wall.

176
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:06,614
Perhaps he's forgotten
we're fighting a war.

177
00:11:06,648 --> 00:11:08,616
We have no men to spare.

178
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:10,352
"The cold winds
are rising

179
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:12,955
and the dead rise
with them."

180
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:16,592
The northerners are
a superstitious people.

181
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:18,694
According to the Commander,
one of these dead men

182
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:20,764
attacked him
in his chambers.

183
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:22,799
Mormont doesn't lie.

184
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,469
<i>How do you kill</i>
<i>a dead man?</i>

185
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:28,438
Apparently you burn him.

186
00:11:29,674 --> 00:11:31,408
One trip to the Wall
and you come back

187
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:34,778
believing in grumpkins
and snarks.

188
00:11:35,746 --> 00:11:38,348
I don't know
what I believe,

189
00:11:38,382 --> 00:11:40,449
but here's
a fact for you--

190
00:11:40,484 --> 00:11:42,084
<i>the Night's Watch</i>
<i>is the only thing</i>

191
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,786
that separates us from
what lies beyond the Wall.

192
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:47,222
I have every confidence
that the brave men

193
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:49,959
of the Night's Watch
will protect us all.

194
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:53,162
<i>And I said,</i>

195
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:54,863
"if the Gods wanted us
to have dignity,

196
00:11:54,898 --> 00:11:57,766
they wouldn't make us
fart when we died."

197
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:01,502
We fart when we die?

198
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:03,471
My blessed mother--

199
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:05,573
I was holding her hand
when she left this world.

200
00:12:05,607 --> 00:12:09,176
She farted so hard,
the whole bed shook.

201
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:22,288
Seems a bit greedy for one man
to have so many wives.

202
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:24,791
Wouldn't two or three
be enough for him?

203
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:27,728
We were having
a serious discussion.

204
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:30,965
Would you look at that?

205
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:35,204
Nothing like the sight
of a woman walking away.

206
00:12:35,238 --> 00:12:38,107
I prefer watching them
come towards me.

207
00:12:38,141 --> 00:12:39,742
I'm sure
that's nice, too.

208
00:12:39,776 --> 00:12:42,911
Yeah, well, there was
a milkmaid named Violet

209
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:45,514
on the next farm over
from where I grew up.

210
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:48,516
<i>We were wrestling together</i>
<i>from the time we were six years old.</i>

211
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:53,521
And then we got older
and the wrestling, uh...

212
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,757
Changed.

213
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,625
You were with her?

214
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,261
How many times?

215
00:13:01,295 --> 00:13:03,797
Well, as many times
as I could.

216
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:09,603
I wish I grew up
on a farm.

217
00:13:09,638 --> 00:13:10,972
We need more potatoes.

218
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:13,374
Get another sack
from the sledge.

219
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:18,880
Get the turnips, too.

220
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:33,894
No. Ghost, no.

221
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:36,363
<i>No!</i>

222
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:38,965
Ghost, away.
Shoo, shoo!

223
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,871
You all right?

224
00:13:44,906 --> 00:13:47,708
- Did he frighten you?
- You-- you shouldn't touch me.

225
00:13:47,742 --> 00:13:51,312
Oh. Oh, right.

226
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:52,981
I'm sorry.

227
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:55,784
I just wanted to make sure
you weren't hurt.

228
00:14:01,826 --> 00:14:03,826
You're very brave.

229
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,171
What are you doing?

230
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:18,005
This is Gilly.

231
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,441
She's one of Craster's...
daughters.

232
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,324
Hello, Gilly.
What are you doing?

233
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:24,017
Sam said
you could help.

234
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,686
I'm sorry, but Sam knows
we're not supposed--

235
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:26,911
She's pregnant.

236
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:37,227
Have to take her
with us when we leave.

237
00:14:37,261 --> 00:14:39,062
What?

238
00:14:39,096 --> 00:14:40,897
- What would that--
I know it sounds a bit mad.

239
00:14:40,932 --> 00:14:42,665
No, it doesn't sound a bit mad,
it's impossible.

240
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,034
- The Lord Commander ordered us to--
- We are sworn to protect.

241
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:47,636
- Sam, we can't take--
- please, ser, please.

242
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:49,571
I can still run
if I have to.

243
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:52,007
- It's just not possible.
- I'm going to have a baby.

244
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,609
If it's a boy...

245
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,577
If it's a boy, what?

246
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:03,951
You want us to risk
our lives for you

247
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:06,087
and you won't even
tell us why?

248
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:14,729
- Why'd you do that?
- Do what? Ask her a question?

249
00:15:14,763 --> 00:15:16,564
- You were cruel.
- Cruel?

250
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:18,566
Sam, are you in such a hurry
to lose a hand?

251
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:20,935
- I didn't touch her.
- No, you just want to steal her.

252
00:15:20,969 --> 00:15:22,704
What do you think
Craster cuts off for that?

253
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:24,739
I can't steal her.

254
00:15:24,773 --> 00:15:27,041
She's a person,
not a goat.

255
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,417
We're heading deeper and deeper
into wildling territory.

256
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:38,254
We can't take a girl with us.
Mormont wouldn't have it.

257
00:15:38,288 --> 00:15:41,190
And even if he would,
what would we do with her?

258
00:15:41,224 --> 00:15:43,092
Who's going to
deliver a baby, you?

259
00:15:44,295 --> 00:15:46,296
I could try.

260
00:15:46,331 --> 00:15:49,265
What?
I've read about it.

261
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,901
A bit.

262
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:55,706
I'm sorry, Sam.

263
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,641
We can't help her.

264
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,269
Khaleesi.

265
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:43,251
- You don't need to see this.
- He is blood of my blood.

266
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:50,025
- Who did this?
- Khal Pono, perhaps.

267
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:52,394
<i>Khal Jhaqo.</i>

268
00:17:52,428 --> 00:17:55,497
They don't like the idea of a woman
leading a Khalasar.

269
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,766
They will like it far less
when I am done with them.

270
00:19:31,193 --> 00:19:32,860
Is it as you remember,
My Lord?

271
00:19:32,894 --> 00:19:35,095
It looks smaller.

272
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:36,963
Everything looks bigger
when you're a child.

273
00:19:36,997 --> 00:19:38,898
I remember
my father's cabin

274
00:19:38,932 --> 00:19:40,733
felt like a palace
when I was little.

275
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:44,270
Now look at it.

276
00:19:44,304 --> 00:19:46,572
They'll be waiting
for me on the docks.

277
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:48,374
Who will?

278
00:19:48,408 --> 00:19:50,242
<i>Anyone who matters.</i>

279
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:52,444
This is a big day for them.

280
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:55,981
They haven't had much to get
excited about since I left.

281
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:58,083
It's a hard place,
the Iron Islands.

282
00:19:58,118 --> 00:19:59,652
<i>Always has been.</i>

283
00:19:59,686 --> 00:20:01,921
It's cold and it's wet.

284
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:03,690
Oh, I love
the cold and wet.

285
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:06,292
They say hard places
breed hard men.

286
00:20:07,995 --> 00:20:10,530
And hard men
rule the world.

287
00:20:11,698 --> 00:20:15,034
Then you'll be king
before long.

288
00:20:17,337 --> 00:20:20,840
Try smiling with
your lips closed.

289
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:23,008
Better.

290
00:20:25,412 --> 00:20:28,347
My father doesn't trust
you Iron islanders.

291
00:20:28,381 --> 00:20:30,349
I don't blame him.

292
00:20:30,383 --> 00:20:33,386
<i>He says that you're all</i>
<i>reavers and rapers</i>

293
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,254
and that no matter
how many women you have,

294
00:20:35,288 --> 00:20:37,289
you'll never be sat-- uh!

295
00:20:37,324 --> 00:20:40,592
Quit talking about your father.

296
00:20:40,627 --> 00:20:43,429
But he's right
about us.

297
00:20:43,463 --> 00:20:47,165
Our wives from the Iron Islands,
they're for breeding.

298
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,568
That's not enough for us.

299
00:20:49,602 --> 00:20:52,070
That's why
we take salt wives--

300
00:20:52,105 --> 00:20:53,672
the women we capture.

301
00:20:53,707 --> 00:20:55,207
Capture me.

302
00:20:55,242 --> 00:20:57,342
Take me with you
when you go ashore.

303
00:20:57,377 --> 00:21:01,514
- Make me your salt wife.
- Your place is on this ship.

304
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:03,682
Not after you leave.

305
00:21:03,717 --> 00:21:06,051
Father will punish me.

306
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:07,686
He'll call me a whore.

307
00:21:08,755 --> 00:21:11,257
I haven't paid you.

308
00:21:23,171 --> 00:21:25,839
Oh, yeah.

309
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,985
<i>- I paid good money...</i>

310
00:21:47,462 --> 00:21:49,830
I'm not going to stand for this.

311
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:51,565
I barely touched her.

312
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,801
Now, you charge twice as much
as every other brothel

313
00:21:53,835 --> 00:21:55,702
and this is
what I get-- crying.

314
00:21:55,737 --> 00:21:58,072
One moment, my friend.
A moment.

315
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:09,784
Please accept
my sincerest apologies.

316
00:22:09,818 --> 00:22:12,186
Aremca will take
good care of you.

317
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:46,721
- I'm sorry, My Lord.
- Shh, shh.

318
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,791
Did he hurt you?

319
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:53,929
No, My Lord.

320
00:22:53,963 --> 00:22:56,732
It's Mhaegen.

321
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:59,134
Who?

322
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,872
She works for you.

323
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:06,509
She's the one--
the Gold Cloaks,

324
00:23:06,543 --> 00:23:08,844
- they killed her baby.
- Ah, yes.

325
00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:11,547
That was...

326
00:23:11,581 --> 00:23:13,783
poorly handled.

327
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,454
Sometimes those
with the most power

328
00:23:17,488 --> 00:23:20,190
have the least grace.

329
00:23:20,224 --> 00:23:23,794
I can't stop
thinking about it.

330
00:23:23,828 --> 00:23:25,930
I can't sleep.

331
00:23:27,632 --> 00:23:30,434
That poor little baby.

332
00:23:30,468 --> 00:23:33,270
You know, you remind me
of another girl,

333
00:23:33,304 --> 00:23:35,339
a lovely thing
I once acquired

334
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:38,375
from a Lysene
pleasure house--

335
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,545
beautiful, like yourself,

336
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:45,115
and intelligent,
like yourself.

337
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:48,018
But she wasn't happy.

338
00:23:49,087 --> 00:23:52,423
She cried often.

339
00:23:52,457 --> 00:23:56,560
I asked her why,
but we didn't have

340
00:23:56,595 --> 00:23:59,464
the kind of rapport
that you and I have.

341
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:05,403
Yes, it was quite sad.

342
00:24:07,073 --> 00:24:10,409
Girls from the Lysene
pleasure houses are expensive,

343
00:24:10,443 --> 00:24:12,578
extremely expensive.

344
00:24:12,612 --> 00:24:16,249
And this one wasn't
making me any money.

345
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,022
I hate bad investments.

346
00:24:23,056 --> 00:24:26,091
Really, I-- I do.

347
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,160
They haunt me.

348
00:24:31,665 --> 00:24:35,267
I had no idea
how to make her happy,

349
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:38,369
no idea how
to mitigate my losses.

350
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:42,006
A very wealthy patron,
he offered me

351
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,641
a tremendous
amount of money

352
00:24:43,675 --> 00:24:48,646
to let him transform
this lovely, sad girl.

353
00:24:48,681 --> 00:24:52,450
To use her
in ways that...

354
00:24:52,485 --> 00:24:55,220
Would never occur
to most men.

355
00:24:56,489 --> 00:24:59,624
And you know what
occurs to most men.

356
00:25:02,862 --> 00:25:07,699
I would not say he succeeded in
making her happy,

357
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:12,337
but my losses were
definitely mitigated.

358
00:25:20,112 --> 00:25:22,280
Take tonight off
to mourn Mhaegen's child.

359
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:25,750
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

360
00:25:25,784 --> 00:25:28,553
And you'll be happy?

361
00:25:31,991 --> 00:25:34,059
That makes me happy.

362
00:25:45,871 --> 00:25:47,505
<i>More wine?</i>

363
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:50,541
- Damn it, boy!
- Apologies, My Lord.

364
00:25:50,576 --> 00:25:54,612
Leave us, Podrick. I believe we
know how to pour our own wine.

365
00:25:55,548 --> 00:25:57,182
That's your new squire?

366
00:25:57,216 --> 00:25:59,250
I could've found you
a proper lad.

367
00:25:59,285 --> 00:26:02,020
Myself, I prefer
the improper ones.

368
00:26:02,055 --> 00:26:05,057
Mm, that's a good red.
Dornish?

369
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:06,558
You know your wines,
My Lord.

370
00:26:06,592 --> 00:26:08,093
That I do.

371
00:26:08,128 --> 00:26:10,930
A fine dinner, My Lord.

372
00:26:10,964 --> 00:26:12,899
Call me Tyrion, please.

373
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:14,768
I'm sure you're getting
used to fine dinners,

374
00:26:14,802 --> 00:26:16,336
now that you're a lord.

375
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:18,238
Maybe I'll hire
this cook of yours.

376
00:26:18,273 --> 00:26:20,274
Wars have been
started for less.

377
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:25,446
I heard there was some trouble in
Littlefinger's brothel the other night.

378
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,614
Mm, nasty business.

379
00:26:27,648 --> 00:26:29,616
- Had to be done.
- Yes, of course.

380
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,884
The City Watch
must keep the peace,

381
00:26:31,918 --> 00:26:35,787
only I hadn't realized
peace depended on killing babies.

382
00:26:35,822 --> 00:26:39,357
- Orders are orders.
- Quite right.

383
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:41,459
Especially
the queen's orders.

384
00:26:41,493 --> 00:26:43,261
I never said they were
the queen's orders.

385
00:26:43,295 --> 00:26:47,799
No, but who else would want to
murder King Robert's bastards?

386
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:49,467
She's always been
a jealous woman.

387
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:51,502
You know your sister
better than I do.

388
00:26:51,537 --> 00:26:53,571
You've heard the awful rumors
about my brother and sister?

389
00:26:53,606 --> 00:26:55,240
I don't listen to filth.

390
00:26:55,274 --> 00:26:58,543
That's good of you,
but you have heard them.

391
00:26:58,577 --> 00:27:01,479
I suppose people who do believe
that filth consider Robert's bastards

392
00:27:01,513 --> 00:27:04,181
to be better claimants to the throne
than Cersei's children.

393
00:27:04,216 --> 00:27:06,284
Joffrey is my king.
The rest doesn't interest me.

394
00:27:06,318 --> 00:27:08,486
I appreciate
your loyalty.

395
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:14,090
Tell me, when your men
slaughtered Ned Stark's men

396
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:17,960
in the throne room,
did you give the order?

397
00:27:17,995 --> 00:27:19,962
I did.

398
00:27:19,996 --> 00:27:21,697
And I would again.

399
00:27:21,731 --> 00:27:23,532
The man was a traitor.

400
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:25,535
He tried to buy
my loyalty.

401
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:27,737
The fool.

402
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:29,906
He had no idea
you were already bought.

403
00:27:29,941 --> 00:27:32,142
Are you drunk?

404
00:27:32,177 --> 00:27:34,345
I'll not have my honor
questioned by an Imp!

405
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,483
I'm not questioning
Your Honor, Lord Janos.

406
00:27:38,517 --> 00:27:40,186
I'm denying its existence.

407
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,322
If you think I'll stand here
and take this from you, dwarf--

408
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:46,091
Dwarf? Mm, you should
have stopped at Imp.

409
00:27:46,126 --> 00:27:48,794
And, yes, you will stand here
and take it from me,

410
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:51,197
unless you'd like to take it
from my friend here.

411
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,233
I intend to serve
as Hand of the King

412
00:27:54,267 --> 00:27:55,934
until my father
returns from the war.

413
00:27:56,002 --> 00:27:58,069
And seeing as you betrayed
the last Hand of the King,

414
00:27:58,104 --> 00:28:01,005
well, I just wouldn't
feel safe with you lurking about.

415
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,540
What are you t--

416
00:28:02,575 --> 00:28:04,343
my friends at court
will not allow this!

417
00:28:04,377 --> 00:28:06,478
- The queen herself has granted--
- The <i>queen regent.</i>

418
00:28:06,512 --> 00:28:09,381
And you're a fool to believe
she is your friend.

419
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,751
We shall hear what Joffrey
has to say about this.

420
00:28:11,785 --> 00:28:14,854
No, we shan't.

421
00:28:20,394 --> 00:28:23,697
There's a ship leaving
for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea tonight.

422
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:27,366
From there I'm afraid it's rather
a long walk to Castle Black.

423
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:29,536
<i>I hope you enjoy the Wall.</i>

424
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,438
I found it
surprisingly beautiful...

425
00:28:32,473 --> 00:28:36,409
In a brutal, horribly
uncomfortable sort of way.

426
00:28:36,443 --> 00:28:37,977
The lads will escort you.

427
00:28:38,012 --> 00:28:39,879
The streets aren't safe
at night, My Lord.

428
00:28:39,913 --> 00:28:42,282
These men are
under my command!

429
00:28:42,316 --> 00:28:44,484
I command you to arrest
this cutthroat.

430
00:28:44,518 --> 00:28:46,353
His name is Bronn

431
00:28:46,387 --> 00:28:48,688
and he is the new
commander of the City Watch.

432
00:28:48,722 --> 00:28:50,356
Boys.

433
00:28:52,526 --> 00:28:54,894
I have friends at court,

434
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:57,464
powerful friends!

435
00:28:57,498 --> 00:29:00,066
The king himself
made me a lord!

436
00:29:05,006 --> 00:29:07,274
To the new Commander.

437
00:29:13,315 --> 00:29:17,351
If I told you to murder
an infant girl, say,

438
00:29:17,385 --> 00:29:20,621
still at her
mother's breast,

439
00:29:20,656 --> 00:29:23,590
would you do it
without question?

440
00:29:24,926 --> 00:29:27,628
Without question? No.

441
00:29:27,662 --> 00:29:29,963
I'd ask, "how much?"

442
00:29:47,283 --> 00:29:49,717
If they come back,
I say we yield.

443
00:29:49,752 --> 00:29:51,052
Gendry's the one
they want.

444
00:29:51,086 --> 00:29:53,154
Don't want to get caught
in the middle of a battle.

445
00:29:53,188 --> 00:29:54,788
I ain't afraid
of no battles.

446
00:29:54,822 --> 00:29:57,457
If you got within a mile of a battle,
you'd fill your pants.

447
00:29:57,492 --> 00:29:58,992
I've seen
lots of battles.

448
00:29:59,026 --> 00:30:00,693
- I saw--
- Liar.

449
00:30:00,728 --> 00:30:02,963
I saw a man
kill another man

450
00:30:02,997 --> 00:30:05,365
just outside a tavern
in Flea Bottom.

451
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,801
Stabbed him
right in the neck.

452
00:30:07,836 --> 00:30:10,637
Two men fighting
isn't a battle.

453
00:30:10,672 --> 00:30:13,507
- They had armor on.
- So?

454
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:16,043
So, if they've got armor on,
it's a battle.

455
00:30:16,077 --> 00:30:17,845
No, it isn't.

456
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:20,481
What does a dyer's apprentice
know about battles anyway?

457
00:30:20,515 --> 00:30:22,783
Gendry's an armorer's
apprentice.

458
00:30:22,817 --> 00:30:25,719
Hot pie, tell Gendry
what makes a fight into a battle.

459
00:30:27,555 --> 00:30:30,057
It's, um, when
they've got armor on.

460
00:30:30,091 --> 00:30:32,893
<i>Who told you that?</i>

461
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:34,361
A knight.

462
00:30:34,396 --> 00:30:37,031
How'd you know
he was a knight?

463
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:41,702
Well, it was 'cause
he got armor on.

464
00:30:41,736 --> 00:30:43,770
You don't have to be a knight
to have armor.

465
00:30:43,805 --> 00:30:45,472
Any idiot
can buy armor.

466
00:30:45,507 --> 00:30:47,241
<i>How do you know?</i>

467
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:49,376
'Cause I sold armor.

468
00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:03,756
What do the Gold Cloaks
want with you?

469
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:06,626
- No idea.
- <i>You're a liar.</i>

470
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,961
You know, you shouldn't insult
people that are bigger than you.

471
00:31:08,996 --> 00:31:11,631
Then I wouldn't get
to insult anyone.

472
00:31:11,665 --> 00:31:14,033
I don't care
what any of them want.

473
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:15,802
No good's ever come
of their questions.

474
00:31:15,836 --> 00:31:18,037
No good's <i>ever</i> come?

475
00:31:18,072 --> 00:31:20,073
Who asked questions
before?

476
00:31:20,107 --> 00:31:23,409
How can someone so small be such
a huge pain in my ass?

477
00:31:23,443 --> 00:31:25,511
Who asked questions?

478
00:31:27,614 --> 00:31:29,081
The Hand of the King.

479
00:31:29,115 --> 00:31:31,317
Hands of the King.

480
00:31:31,351 --> 00:31:34,520
Lord Arryn came first
a few weeks before he died,

481
00:31:34,554 --> 00:31:39,091
and then Lord Stark came
a few weeks before he died.

482
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:41,060
Lord Stark?

483
00:31:41,094 --> 00:31:45,364
See? Asking me
questions is bad luck.

484
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,300
You'll probably
be dead soon.

485
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:52,603
- What did they ask about?
- My mom.

486
00:31:52,637 --> 00:31:55,306
- Who's your mom?
- Just my mom--

487
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,375
worked in a tavern,
died when I was little.

488
00:31:57,409 --> 00:31:58,876
And who was your father?

489
00:31:58,911 --> 00:32:02,279
Could've been one of those
gold-hatted bastards, for all I know.

490
00:32:02,313 --> 00:32:04,414
What about you anyway?

491
00:32:04,448 --> 00:32:07,550
You thought
they were after you.

492
00:32:07,585 --> 00:32:09,385
Why?

493
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,954
Did you kill someone or is it
just because you're a girl?

494
00:32:13,123 --> 00:32:15,257
- I'm not a girl.
- Yes, you are.

495
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:16,582
Do you think I'm as stupid
as the rest of them?

496
00:32:16,607 --> 00:32:17,807
Stupider.

497
00:32:18,128 --> 00:32:19,583
The Night's Watch doesn't take girls,
everyone knows that.

498
00:32:19,584 --> 00:32:21,121
Yeah, that's true,
but you're still a girl.

499
00:32:21,146 --> 00:32:22,346
I am not!

500
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,901
Yeah? Well, pull your cock out
and take a piss, then.

501
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:28,238
I don't need
to take a piss.

502
00:32:34,446 --> 00:32:36,514
Lommy and hot pie
can't know.

503
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:37,982
No one can know.

504
00:32:38,017 --> 00:32:41,920
Well, they won't,
not from me.

505
00:32:44,556 --> 00:32:47,091
My name's not Arry.

506
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:49,893
It's Arya...
of House Stark.

507
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:55,164
Yoren is taking me home
to Winterfell.

508
00:32:55,198 --> 00:32:58,467
He was your father--
the Hand, the traitor.

509
00:32:58,501 --> 00:33:00,535
He was never a traitor.

510
00:33:00,569 --> 00:33:02,603
Joffrey is a liar.

511
00:33:02,671 --> 00:33:04,972
So you're a highborn, then.
You're a lady.

512
00:33:05,007 --> 00:33:06,974
No. I mean, yes.

513
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:08,443
My mother was a lady
and my sister--

514
00:33:08,477 --> 00:33:09,944
Yeah, but you were
a lord's daughter

515
00:33:09,978 --> 00:33:12,046
and you lived
in a castle and you--

516
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:14,783
look, all that about cocks,
I should never have said--

517
00:33:14,817 --> 00:33:17,085
and I've been pissing
in front of you and everything.

518
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:19,921
I-- I should be
calling you "My Lady."

519
00:33:19,955 --> 00:33:22,924
- Do not call me "My Lady."
- As My Lady commands.

520
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,893
Well, that was unladylike.

521
00:33:24,927 --> 00:33:27,196
Oh!

522
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,125
What's she carrying?

523
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,861
Myrish oranges,

524
00:33:58,895 --> 00:34:01,931
wine from the Arbor...

525
00:34:01,965 --> 00:34:05,401
And the heir to Pyke
and the Iron Islands.

526
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,839
The only living son
of Balon Greyjoy.

527
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:16,077
Me.

528
00:34:17,246 --> 00:34:19,680
I don't like wine.

529
00:34:19,715 --> 00:34:21,816
Woman's drink.

530
00:34:24,386 --> 00:34:26,188
I need to get to Pyke.

531
00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:38,100
I'll find you a horse.

532
00:34:48,613 --> 00:34:51,982
I'm heading that way.
I can take you there.

533
00:34:52,017 --> 00:34:54,685
I bet you can.

534
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,553
Have you been
at sea long?

535
00:34:56,588 --> 00:34:59,123
Or were there just no women
where you came from?

536
00:34:59,157 --> 00:35:01,559
- None like you.
- You don't know what I'm like.

537
00:35:01,593 --> 00:35:04,261
Maybe you don't know
what you're like.

538
00:35:04,296 --> 00:35:07,331
Maybe you need
someone to teach you.

539
00:35:07,366 --> 00:35:09,500
Do you know who I am?

540
00:35:09,535 --> 00:35:12,771
You think I offer free rides
to every man in jewelry,

541
00:35:12,805 --> 00:35:16,074
Lord Greyjoy?

542
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:20,512
Have my things sent up
to the castle.

543
00:35:37,497 --> 00:35:39,398
You should give me
the reins.

544
00:35:39,432 --> 00:35:41,300
I'm a better rider
than you.

545
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:43,435
I've been on horseback
for the past nine years.

546
00:35:43,469 --> 00:35:44,937
Nine years?

547
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:47,439
Do you still know
your way around a ship?

548
00:35:47,473 --> 00:35:49,508
Have these hands
ever touched a rope?

549
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:52,010
Don't you worry
about my hands.

550
00:35:53,846 --> 00:35:55,947
The sea is in my blood.

551
00:35:55,982 --> 00:35:59,284
Your blood will be in the sea
if I don't watch where I'm going.

552
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:02,487
I have a proposal
for my father,

553
00:36:02,522 --> 00:36:05,191
one that will
make him king again,

554
00:36:05,225 --> 00:36:07,293
and me after him.

555
00:36:09,062 --> 00:36:11,998
You may get to stay
in a castle tonight if you're lucky.

556
00:36:12,032 --> 00:36:14,167
Is that an offer
from my future king?

557
00:36:14,202 --> 00:36:16,770
An order from
your future king.

558
00:36:18,973 --> 00:36:21,675
You can tell your grandchildren
about this night.

559
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:24,844
I don't imagine it will be
a story fit for children.

560
00:36:38,057 --> 00:36:40,191
Father.

561
00:36:40,226 --> 00:36:43,394
Nine years, is it?

562
00:36:43,429 --> 00:36:45,430
They took
a frightened boy.

563
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:48,300
<i>What have</i>
<i>they given back?</i>

564
00:36:49,736 --> 00:36:51,737
A man.

565
00:36:51,772 --> 00:36:55,175
- Your blood and your heir.
- <i>We shall see.</i>

566
00:36:56,344 --> 00:36:59,247
Stark had you
longer than I did.

567
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:01,449
<i>Lord Stark is gone.</i>

568
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:06,254
And how do you feel
about that?

569
00:37:09,025 --> 00:37:11,593
What's done is done.

570
00:37:11,627 --> 00:37:13,662
I've brought you
a proposal from Robb Stark.

571
00:37:13,696 --> 00:37:16,831
Who gave you
those clothes?

572
00:37:16,865 --> 00:37:20,335
Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
to make you his daughter?

573
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:23,304
If my clothes offend you,
I will change them.

574
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:25,006
You will.

575
00:37:26,075 --> 00:37:28,577
That bauble
'round your neck--

576
00:37:28,611 --> 00:37:31,747
did you pay the iron price
for it or the gold?

577
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:34,550
<i>I asked a question.</i>

578
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:37,220
<i>Did you pull it from the neck</i>
<i>of a corpse you made</i>

579
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:41,858
or did you buy it
to match your fine clothes?

580
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,962
Iron or gold?

581
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:51,333
Gold.

582
00:37:54,704 --> 00:37:58,007
I'll not have my son
dressed as a whore.

583
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,478
My fears have come true--

584
00:38:03,513 --> 00:38:05,747
the Starks
have made you theirs.

585
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:09,052
- My blood is salt and iron.
- Yet the Stark boy sends you to me

586
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:12,355
like a trained raven
clutching his message.

587
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,357
The offer he makes
is one I proposed.

588
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,960
- He heeds your counsel?
- I've lived with him,

589
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,562
hunted with him,
fought at his side.

590
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,231
He thinks of me
as a brother.

591
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:22,901
No, not here,
not in my hearing.

592
00:38:22,935 --> 00:38:25,436
You will not
name him brother,

593
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:29,407
this son of the man who put
your true brothers to the sword.

594
00:38:29,442 --> 00:38:32,277
Or have you forgotten
your own blood?

595
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:34,279
I forget nothing.

596
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:37,182
I remember my brothers.

597
00:38:37,217 --> 00:38:40,152
And I remember
when my father was a king.

598
00:38:56,237 --> 00:38:58,238
I see.

599
00:38:58,273 --> 00:39:00,874
I destroy Robb Stark's
enemies for him

600
00:39:00,908 --> 00:39:04,311
and he will make me
king of the Iron Islands once again.

601
00:39:04,345 --> 00:39:08,147
- I will lead the attack myself.
- Oh, you will?

602
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:10,783
I'm your son,
your only living heir.

603
00:39:10,817 --> 00:39:13,252
Who else?

604
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:17,389
I told you to wait outside.

605
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:20,826
How did you get
past the guards?

606
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,261
Anything with a cock
is easy to fool.

607
00:39:23,296 --> 00:39:26,065
My dear.

608
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:30,836
Yara?

609
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:33,739
So good to see you,
brother.

610
00:39:33,773 --> 00:39:37,409
This is a homecoming I'll tell
my grandchildren about.

611
00:39:39,913 --> 00:39:41,347
She can't lead an attack!

612
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:44,617
- And why not?
- You're a woman!

613
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:48,087
- You're the one in skirts.
- This isn't Winterfell, boy.

614
00:39:48,122 --> 00:39:50,623
Your sister took over command
of your eldest brother's ship

615
00:39:50,658 --> 00:39:53,526
after your new father
killed him.

616
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:57,263
What's dead may never die.

617
00:39:57,298 --> 00:39:59,299
The only nights she's spent
off these islands

618
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:01,334
have been spent
on the sea.

619
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:04,370
<i>She's commanded men.</i>

620
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:06,439
<i>She's killed men.</i>

621
00:40:06,473 --> 00:40:08,608
She knows who she is.

622
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:13,713
No man gives me
a crown.

623
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:16,950
I pay the iron price.

624
00:40:16,984 --> 00:40:18,918
I will take my crown,

625
00:40:18,953 --> 00:40:22,222
for that is who I am.

626
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:24,691
That is who
we have always been.

627
00:40:29,331 --> 00:40:31,399
You won't stand a chance against
the Lannisters on your own.

628
00:40:31,433 --> 00:40:34,302
Who said anything
about the Lannisters?

629
00:40:41,912 --> 00:40:43,380
<i>You'll have your gold</i>

630
00:40:43,414 --> 00:40:45,048
<i>when we take the treasury</i>
<i>at King's Landing.</i>

631
00:40:45,082 --> 00:40:46,850
All these kings
fighting for the throne,

632
00:40:46,884 --> 00:40:49,820
and this Stannis
has the smallest army.

633
00:40:49,854 --> 00:40:51,821
Why would I bet on the man
with the worst chance?

634
00:40:51,856 --> 00:40:55,158
Because you're
a smart gambler.

635
00:40:55,193 --> 00:40:58,161
Stannis has proved
himself in war twice.

636
00:40:58,195 --> 00:41:01,464
His baby brother has never set foot
on a battlefield.

637
00:41:01,499 --> 00:41:03,266
Neither has
the false King Joffrey.

638
00:41:03,301 --> 00:41:05,268
And yet they both
have larger armies.

639
00:41:05,302 --> 00:41:07,270
Stannis has just
begun the fight.

640
00:41:07,304 --> 00:41:10,906
His Bannermen
will rally to his cause.

641
00:41:10,941 --> 00:41:13,642
There's no man
in the Seven Kingdoms

642
00:41:13,676 --> 00:41:15,244
more honorable
than Stannis Baratheon

643
00:41:15,278 --> 00:41:16,678
or more worthy
of loyalty.

644
00:41:16,713 --> 00:41:18,279
What is the world
coming to

645
00:41:18,314 --> 00:41:20,915
when smugglers must vouch
for the honor of kings?

646
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:23,351
- Mind your words, pirate.
- Matthos.

647
00:41:23,385 --> 00:41:24,919
You think I'm insulted?

648
00:41:24,954 --> 00:41:27,955
I <i>am</i> a pirate.
I'm an excellent pirate.

649
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,625
<i>I don't sail</i>
<i>for promises.</i>

650
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:32,059
Of course you do.

651
00:41:32,094 --> 00:41:34,762
Every time you leave harbor,
you're leaving on a promise--

652
00:41:34,796 --> 00:41:36,263
a promise that
somewhere on the sea,

653
00:41:36,298 --> 00:41:38,699
somebody's got some gold
and you can take it from him.

654
00:41:38,734 --> 00:41:41,502
- That's a promise that always comes true.
- As is mine.

655
00:41:41,537 --> 00:41:43,772
You're not a young man,
Salladhor.

656
00:41:43,806 --> 00:41:45,607
And correct me
if I'm wrong--

657
00:41:45,641 --> 00:41:47,342
most pirates
don't grow old.

658
00:41:47,377 --> 00:41:49,478
Only the clever ones.

659
00:41:49,512 --> 00:41:52,414
You want to spend
your last few years on the sea

660
00:41:52,448 --> 00:41:54,549
stealing from
Pentoshi cheesemongers

661
00:41:54,584 --> 00:41:55,918
and Meereenese
silk merchants?

662
00:41:55,952 --> 00:41:58,019
Then go.
They're out there waiting for you.

663
00:41:58,054 --> 00:41:59,755
That's easy.

664
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:02,324
What I'm offering you
is hard.

665
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,896
Come with me and plunder
the greatest city in Westeros.

666
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:10,632
You'll be the richest man
in Lys and the most famous.

667
00:42:10,666 --> 00:42:14,536
They'll be singing songs about you
as long as men have voices to sing.

668
00:42:16,206 --> 00:42:18,473
"Salladhor Saan"
is a good name for songs.

669
00:42:18,508 --> 00:42:22,076
- It is.
- <i>One thing-- I want the queen.</i>

670
00:42:22,111 --> 00:42:24,912
- The queen?
- Cersei-- I want her.

671
00:42:24,947 --> 00:42:27,414
I'll sail with your fleet,
all 30 of my ships.

672
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:29,750
And if we don't drown at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay,

673
00:42:29,784 --> 00:42:33,053
I will fuck this blonde queen
and I'll fuck her well.

674
00:42:33,088 --> 00:42:34,922
This war
isn't about you.

675
00:42:34,956 --> 00:42:38,258
We're not attacking King's Landing
so that you can rape the queen.

676
00:42:38,293 --> 00:42:41,094
I'm not going to rape her.
I'm going to fuck her.

677
00:42:41,129 --> 00:42:43,263
As if she would
just let you.

678
00:42:43,297 --> 00:42:44,964
You don't know
how persuasive I am.

679
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:47,266
I've never tried
to fuck you.

680
00:42:48,969 --> 00:42:52,605
Stannis is the rightful king
and the Lord of Light,

681
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:54,006
the one true God--

682
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,607
I've been all over
the world, my boy,

683
00:42:55,642 --> 00:42:58,310
and everywhere I go,
people tell me about the true Gods.

684
00:42:58,344 --> 00:43:00,512
They all think
they found the right one.

685
00:43:00,546 --> 00:43:03,849
The one true God
is what's between a woman's legs,

686
00:43:03,883 --> 00:43:06,452
and better yet,
a queen's legs.

687
00:43:07,955 --> 00:43:10,056
I never thought you'd have
a true believer for a son.

688
00:43:10,091 --> 00:43:11,791
Eh, he's young yet.

689
00:43:13,094 --> 00:43:15,829
I promise you the gold.
I promise you the glory.

690
00:43:15,864 --> 00:43:17,598
I cannot promise you
the queen.

691
00:43:20,936 --> 00:43:22,803
You believe
your king can win?

692
00:43:22,837 --> 00:43:25,038
He is the one true king.

693
00:43:25,072 --> 00:43:26,873
You Westerosi
are funny people.

694
00:43:26,907 --> 00:43:29,275
A man chops off your fingers
and you fall in love with him.

695
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,647
I'll sail with you,
Davos Seaworth.

696
00:43:34,681 --> 00:43:38,284
You're the most honest
smuggler I ever met.

697
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:40,519
Make me rich.

698
00:43:40,553 --> 00:43:43,956
Get me to the gates
of King's Landing and I will.

699
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:57,404
<i>When will the king</i>
<i>have us sail?</i>

700
00:43:57,438 --> 00:43:59,773
As soon as his God
wills it.

701
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:02,443
He's my God, too,
and yours,

702
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:05,146
but you are
too blind to see.

703
00:44:07,249 --> 00:44:09,283
- Let me teach you how to read.
- Oh, you and your mother.

704
00:44:09,317 --> 00:44:10,984
It won't take long.
You already know the letters.

705
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:13,219
The holy books are much more
persuasive than I can be.

706
00:44:13,254 --> 00:44:15,021
I wish I had
a God, truly.

707
00:44:15,056 --> 00:44:17,724
I'm not mocking you, but I've seen
men pray to every God there is--

708
00:44:17,758 --> 00:44:20,159
pray for wind, pray for rain,
pray for home.

709
00:44:20,194 --> 00:44:22,962
- None of it works.
- But you always came home.

710
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:26,933
- I wasn't praying.
- No, but I was.

711
00:44:28,402 --> 00:44:30,069
Every night
that you were at sea,

712
00:44:30,103 --> 00:44:33,206
I lit a candle
and I prayed for you.

713
00:44:34,341 --> 00:44:35,941
You want me
to have a God?

714
00:44:35,975 --> 00:44:39,111
Fine. King Stannis
is my God.

715
00:44:39,145 --> 00:44:41,613
He raised me up
and blessed me with his trust.

716
00:44:41,648 --> 00:44:44,216
He gave you a future
I could never have imagined.

717
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:46,252
You know how to read.
You'll be a knight someday.

718
00:44:46,286 --> 00:44:49,555
You think a fire God
commanded all that?

719
00:44:49,589 --> 00:44:52,991
It was Stannis,
only Stannis.

720
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:55,894
Stannis is my king,
but he's only a man.

721
00:44:55,928 --> 00:44:58,896
Don't tell him that.

722
00:45:00,733 --> 00:45:02,867
Lord Janos Slynt was
commander of the City Watch.

723
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:04,302
You had no right
to exile him.

724
00:45:04,336 --> 00:45:06,037
I have every right.
I am the King's Hand.

725
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:08,606
You're serving as the King's Hand
till father gets here.

726
00:45:08,641 --> 00:45:10,208
I am Queen Regent.

727
00:45:10,243 --> 00:45:11,910
Listen to me,
Queen Regent.

728
00:45:11,945 --> 00:45:14,346
You're losing the people.

729
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:16,483
- Do you hear me?
-  The people.

730
00:45:16,517 --> 00:45:18,285
You think I care?

731
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:19,987
You might
find it difficult

732
00:45:20,021 --> 00:45:22,890
to rule over millions
who want you dead.

733
00:45:22,924 --> 00:45:24,791
Half the city will starve
when winter comes.

734
00:45:24,826 --> 00:45:26,360
The other half will plot
to overthrow you.

735
00:45:26,394 --> 00:45:29,396
<i>And your gold-plated thugs</i>
<i>just gave them</i>

736
00:45:29,431 --> 00:45:31,232
their rallying cry--

737
00:45:31,266 --> 00:45:33,868
"The Queen
slaughters babies."

738
00:45:35,804 --> 00:45:39,440
You don't even have
the decency to deny it.

739
00:45:49,017 --> 00:45:52,520
It wasn't you who gave
the order, was it?

740
00:45:52,555 --> 00:45:54,422
<i>Joffrey didn't</i>
<i>even tell you.</i>

741
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,794
Did he tell you?

742
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:00,163
I imagine that
would be even worse.

743
00:46:00,197 --> 00:46:03,133
He did what needed
to be done.

744
00:46:03,167 --> 00:46:06,203
You want to be Hand of the King?
You want to rule?

745
00:46:06,237 --> 00:46:09,105
This is what ruling is--
lying on a bed of weeds,

746
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,574
ripping them out
by the root, one by one,

747
00:46:11,608 --> 00:46:13,175
before they strangle you
in your sleep.

748
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,744
I'm no king, but I think there's more
to ruling than that.

749
00:46:15,778 --> 00:46:17,779
I don't care
what you think!

750
00:46:17,814 --> 00:46:19,381
You've never
taken it seriously.

751
00:46:19,415 --> 00:46:21,749
You haven't,
Jaime hasn't.

752
00:46:25,254 --> 00:46:27,288
It's all fallen on me.

753
00:46:31,294 --> 00:46:35,130
As has Jaime repeatedly,
according to Stannis Baratheon.

754
00:46:40,036 --> 00:46:42,471
You're funny.

755
00:46:44,774 --> 00:46:48,344
You've always
been funny...

756
00:46:48,378 --> 00:46:50,313
<i>But none of your jokes</i>
<i>will ever match</i>

757
00:46:50,347 --> 00:46:52,548
the first one, will they?

758
00:46:53,751 --> 00:46:56,452
You remember?

759
00:46:56,487 --> 00:46:58,188
Back when you ripped
my mother open

760
00:46:58,222 --> 00:47:00,923
on your way out of her
and she bled to death?

761
00:47:02,426 --> 00:47:05,094
She was my mother, too.

762
00:47:05,128 --> 00:47:07,196
Mother gone...

763
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:11,100
For the sake of you.

764
00:47:13,603 --> 00:47:17,106
<i>There's no bigger joke</i>
<i>in the world than that.</i>

765
00:47:38,429 --> 00:47:41,465
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

766
00:47:41,499 --> 00:47:43,633
How did you fare
with your pirate?

767
00:47:43,668 --> 00:47:47,104
Salladhor Saan will join
our fleet-- 30 ships.

768
00:47:47,138 --> 00:47:49,139
His men know
how to fight.

769
00:47:49,174 --> 00:47:52,576
In my experience, pirates
prefer fighting unarmed men.

770
00:47:52,611 --> 00:47:54,245
It does seem
the wiser choice.

771
00:47:54,279 --> 00:47:56,714
There won't be
a choice this time.

772
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,651
Do you trust him?

773
00:47:59,685 --> 00:48:01,386
Salladhor Saan
is an old friend.

774
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,388
I've known him 30 years.

775
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,690
I've never trusted him,

776
00:48:05,725 --> 00:48:09,828
but once he gets the smell of gold,
he never stops.

777
00:48:09,862 --> 00:48:13,098
Well, if he does his job,
he'll have his share.

778
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:17,870
Leave us.

779
00:48:24,011 --> 00:48:25,612
At once, Your Grace.

780
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,822
The Lord of Light shines
through you, young warrior.

781
00:48:41,495 --> 00:48:43,129
Come.

782
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,470
What did you say to him?

783
00:48:51,504 --> 00:48:54,940
I told him death by fire
is the purest death.

784
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:58,177
- Why?
- <i>Because it is true.</i>

785
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:00,979
You're troubled, my king.

786
00:49:01,014 --> 00:49:03,181
Yeah.

787
00:49:03,216 --> 00:49:05,851
These armies are toys
for the Lord of Light.

788
00:49:05,885 --> 00:49:08,854
Tell your lord
to burn them, then.

789
00:49:08,888 --> 00:49:10,322
I tell him nothing.

790
00:49:10,356 --> 00:49:13,559
I pray for his commands
and I obey.

791
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:19,231
My little brother has 100,000
men according to the scouts,

792
00:49:19,266 --> 00:49:22,468
men whose allegiance
rightly belongs to me.

793
00:49:22,502 --> 00:49:24,403
<i>You must have faith.</i>

794
00:49:24,438 --> 00:49:26,472
Faith?

795
00:49:26,507 --> 00:49:30,042
<i>In a real war, the side</i>
<i>with the greater number wins</i>

796
00:49:30,077 --> 00:49:32,011
nine times out of 10.

797
00:49:32,045 --> 00:49:33,679
Then we must be
the 10th.

798
00:49:33,714 --> 00:49:38,051
I cannot defeat
my brother in the field.

799
00:49:38,085 --> 00:49:41,555
And I can't take King's Landing
without the men he's stolen.

800
00:49:43,058 --> 00:49:46,727
I have seen the path
to victory in the flames.

801
00:49:48,229 --> 00:49:51,598
But first, you must give yourself
to the Lord of Light.

802
00:49:51,632 --> 00:49:54,968
I've said the words,
damn you.

803
00:49:58,072 --> 00:50:00,340
I burnt the idols.

804
00:50:03,644 --> 00:50:07,614
You must give
all of yourself.

805
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:14,120
I have a wife.

806
00:50:15,356 --> 00:50:17,324
I took a vow.

807
00:50:18,492 --> 00:50:22,862
She's sickly, weak...

808
00:50:24,398 --> 00:50:27,500
Shut away in a tower.

809
00:50:27,535 --> 00:50:29,636
She disgusts you.

810
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,675
And she's given
you nothing--

811
00:50:35,743 --> 00:50:40,447
no sons,
only stillborns,

812
00:50:40,481 --> 00:50:42,649
only death.

813
00:50:48,622 --> 00:50:53,092
I will give you
a son, my king.

814
00:50:55,429 --> 00:50:57,530
A son?
