1
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,502
<i>Tansy!</i>

2
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,355
Tansy! Tansy!

3
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,491
Tansy!

4
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:48,293
Tansy!

5
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:50,345
There you are.

6
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:56,718
I can't see her, Ramsay.

7
00:04:00,172 --> 00:04:01,807
Tansy!

8
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,646
If you make it out
of the woods, you win!

9
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,148
Run, Tansy, run!

10
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:21,693
<i>- Tansy.</i>
<i>- Where is she?</i>

11
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:24,963
<i>Tansy, Tansy, Tansy!</i>

12
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:48,487
Good girls.
Down, girls.

13
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,388
Down.

14
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:52,607
Well done.
You, too.

15
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,360
- I only wounded her.
- You brought her down. That's what matters.

16
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:58,080
A fine shot.
Wasn't it, Reek?

17
00:04:58,114 --> 00:05:00,282
A fine shot, master.
My lady.

18
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,567
Please, my lord.
It hurts.

19
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:05,203
Oh, sweet.
Don't cry.

20
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:07,539
It will be over soon.

21
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,460
She thinks she's pretty.

22
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,011
Let me put one
through her face.

23
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,596
We have to reward
the hounds, love.

24
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,465
They did all the hard work.

25
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:19,017
Why? I did
whatever you asked.

26
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,769
But you made Myranda
feel jealous.

27
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:23,722
- Me jealous of her?
- <i> My lord, please.</i>

28
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,942
You can see that your presence
has become a bit of a problem.

29
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:30,979
Rip her!
Rip her!

30
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,098
Rip her!

31
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,070
Not so pretty now.

32
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,502
<i>Your new hand, it's nicer</i>
<i>than the old one.</i>

33
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,836
Wouldn't you agree, Pod?

34
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,955
Is it solid gold?

35
00:05:56,973 --> 00:05:59,975
Gilded steel.
You're not eating.

36
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:01,927
Why is no one eating?

37
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,730
My wife wastes away and my
brother starves himself.

38
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,798
- I'm not hungry.
- You lost a hand,

39
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:09,101
not a stomach.

40
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,936
Try the boar.

41
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,010
Cersei can't get enough of it
since one killed Robert for her.

42
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,275
A toast.

43
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:20,662
To the proud
Lannister children.

44
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:23,582
The dwarf, the cripple,
and the mother of madness.

45
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,233
- Oh!
- I'll clean it up.

46
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:27,285
No, I'll do it.
Leave us.

47
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:32,424
It's only wine.

48
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,468
I can't fight anymore.

49
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:45,137
What about your left?

50
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,008
I can hold a sword, but all
my instincts are wrong.

51
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:52,110
How can I protect the king

52
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,845
when I can hardly
wipe my own ass?

53
00:06:53,863 --> 00:06:56,481
You're the Lord Commander now.
Command.

54
00:06:56,515 --> 00:06:59,401
Let others do the fighting.

55
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,621
When was the last time
Father used a sword?

56
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,040
I'm not Father.
I'm the Kingslayer.

57
00:07:05,074 --> 00:07:07,209
When people find out
I can't slay a pigeon...

58
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:10,495
Train, then. Learn to fight
with your other hand.

59
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:13,882
With whom? You?
Men talk.

60
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,468
Soon as someone discovers I can't
fight, he'll tell everyone.

61
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,007
You need a proper,
discreet swordsman.

62
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:25,677
As it happens,
I have just the one.

63
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:37,522
My brother tells me you
can keep your mouth shut.

64
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:39,524
Unusual talent for a sellsword.

65
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:41,726
He tells me you shit gold

66
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:44,579
just like your father.

67
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:46,498
Is this place safe?

68
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,036
There's this knight, Leygood,

69
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,672
- got thunderbolts on his shield.
- Uh-huh.

70
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,208
Right here is where
I fuck his wife.

71
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,543
She's a screamer, that one.

72
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:01,296
If they don't hear her,
they won't hear us.

73
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,550
I've never seen
Valyrian steel before.

74
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:07,936
She's a beauty.
The problem is,

75
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,305
if you fight with
an edged blade,

76
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,524
I'll have to.

77
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,975
And if I fight with
an edged blade,

78
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,444
I'll have no one
left to pay me.

79
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,565
I haven't used a sparring
sword since I was nine.

80
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,122
Ah!

81
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:30,458
Bold warrior you are, attacking
a man when his guard's down.

82
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:32,794
Best time to attack a man.

83
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,831
Mind yourself.

84
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:41,309
- If I still had my right hand...
- Plan on growing it back?

85
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:57,652
Come on, then.

86
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,865
<i>Open the gates!</i>

87
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:14,786
<i>Riders coming in!</i>

88
00:09:30,502 --> 00:09:33,305
<i>Let's get these horses seen to!</i>

89
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,776
Father.
Welcome home.

90
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,896
Walda, this is
Ramsay Snow, my bastard.

91
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,015
A pleasure, Mother.

92
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:46,067
Hello.

93
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,787
<i>See that the horses are fed,</i>
<i>watered, and rubbed down.</i>

94
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:52,123
And take Lady Walda
to her chambers.

95
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,192
This way, my lady.

96
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,294
Where is your prize?

97
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,912
With the hounds.

98
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,549
I'll have a look at him.

99
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,207
I hear you took a hand
from the Kingslayer.

100
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:12,010
Word travels.
How he screamed.

101
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,512
You would have loved it.

102
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,690
Father.

103
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,001
What did you do to him?

104
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:40,338
I trained him. He was a slow
learner, but he learned.

105
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,008
You flayed him.

106
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,410
Peeled a few bits.

107
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:47,379
Removed a few others.

108
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,267
This was Balon Greyjoy's
son and heir.

109
00:10:52,301 --> 00:10:54,719
We've been flaying
our enemies for 1,000 years.

110
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:56,805
The flayed man
is on our banners.

111
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,690
My banners, not yours.

112
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,725
You're not a Bolton.
You're a Snow.

113
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,931
Tywin Lannister has given
me the North.

114
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:09,451
But he won't lift a finger
to help me take it.

115
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:11,369
As long as the ironborn
hold Moat Cailin,

116
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,605
<i>our armies are trapped</i>
<i>south of the Neck.</i>

117
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,908
Theon was a valuable
hostage, not your plaything.

118
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:20,378
I wanted to trade him
for Moat Cailin.

119
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,213
I already asked.

120
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,717
Lord Greyjoy refused.
Savages have no...

121
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,753
You sent terms to Balon
Greyjoy without my consent?

122
00:11:28,787 --> 00:11:30,839
You made me acting
Lord of the Dreadfort.

123
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,340
I acted.

124
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:40,982
I had to smuggle myself
into my own lands

125
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:42,817
thanks to the Greyjoys.

126
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:44,819
I needed Theon.

127
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:46,771
I needed him whole.

128
00:11:46,822 --> 00:11:50,308
Theon was our enemy.

129
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:52,327
But Reek,

130
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:55,196
Reek will never betray us.

131
00:11:56,365 --> 00:11:58,950
I placed far too much
trust in you.

132
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,629
Reek, how could you let me stand
before my father unshaven?

133
00:12:11,663 --> 00:12:15,133
- <i> It's disrespectful.</i>
- I'm sorry, my lord.

134
00:12:17,353 --> 00:12:19,471
Give him the razor.

135
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,565
If I'm not a Bolton,
Father, what does it matter?

136
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:40,241
Go on, Reek.

137
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,710
<i>A nice close shave.</i>

138
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,434
Reek, tell Father

139
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,521
where are Bran
and Rickon Stark?

140
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,573
I don't know, my lord.

141
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:13,358
You murdered them

142
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:17,162
and displayed their corpses
at Winterfell.

143
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:20,615
<i>Reek,</i>

144
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:22,900
did you murder the Stark boys?

145
00:13:22,918 --> 00:13:25,086
No, my lord.

146
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,404
Just two farm boys.

147
00:13:26,422 --> 00:13:29,407
<i>And crisped them</i>
<i>so no one would know.</i>

148
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:32,043
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

149
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,581
The Starks have always
ruled the North.

150
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:39,267
If Bran and Rickon are alive,

151
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:41,886
the country will rally
to their side

152
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,105
now that Robb Stark is gone.

153
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:49,143
<i>Oh, that's right, Reek.</i>

154
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,614
Robb Stark is dead.

155
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:55,400
<i>Sorry.</i>

156
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,702
<i>I know he was like</i>
<i>a brother to you.</i>

157
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,655
But my father put a knife
through his heart.

158
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,077
How do you feel about that?

159
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,976
- You ready for a hunt?
- Always.

160
00:14:22,011 --> 00:14:25,263
Find those boys and I'll give
you 1,000 acres and a holdfast.

161
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,315
Your pet rat have any thoughts

162
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:29,567
on which way they went
after Winterfell?

163
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,738
Jon Snow is at Castle Black.

164
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:37,108
Who the fuck is Jon Snow?

165
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,493
Their bastard brother.

166
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:40,811
He could be sheltering them.

167
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:42,413
He may know where they are.

168
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:47,502
Even if he doesn't,
he's half Stark himself.

169
00:14:47,536 --> 00:14:49,170
Could be a threat.

170
00:14:49,204 --> 00:14:51,356
You want to prove
yourself a Bolton?

171
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,959
Gather whatever men you can
and ride for Moat Cailin.

172
00:14:54,993 --> 00:14:57,211
Bring this creature of yours.

173
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,548
Maybe he'll be of some use.

174
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,002
Take the Moat for the family,

175
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,688
for<i> our</i> family,

176
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:09,223
and I'll reconsider
your position.

177
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:15,780
Lord Varys. Breakfasting
with the king?

178
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,117
I'm afraid foreigners aren't
welcome at such exclusive affairs.

179
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,953
- Oh, to be foreign.
- Ahem.

180
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,122
Shae has been noticed.

181
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,657
Sansa's maid saw you with her.

182
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,375
She already told your sister.

183
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,661
It's only a matter of time
before your father hears.

184
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,863
So I'm guilty of being seen
with my own wife's handmaiden.

185
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:34,666
My father will ask you
if there's anything more

186
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,367
and you'll tell him
some clever lie.

187
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:38,086
No, I will not.

188
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:41,389
How long do you imagine your father
and sister would let me live

189
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:43,758
if they suspected me of lying?

190
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,177
I have no pet sellsword
to protect me.

191
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:48,262
No legendary brother
to avenge me.

192
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,732
<i>Only little birds</i>
<i>who whisper in my ear.</i>

193
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:52,550
Forgive me
if I don't weep for you.

194
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:55,603
No one weeps
for spiders or whores.

195
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,773
I have friends across
the sea who could help her.

196
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,325
She won't leave.

197
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,609
I've told her this is
a dangerous place

198
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,561
so many times,
she no longer believes it.

199
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:06,564
Your father has promised to hang
the next whore he finds you with.

200
00:16:06,582 --> 00:16:10,118
Have you ever known your
father to make an idle threat?

201
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,340
From House Tyrell and the
people of the Reach,

202
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:19,577
Your Grace, it is my honor to
present you with this wedding cup.

203
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:22,130
May you
and my daughter Margaery

204
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,965
drink deep and live long.

205
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,417
A handsome goblet, my lord.

206
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:29,086
Or shall I call you Father?

207
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:31,639
I shall be honored, Your Grace.

208
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:41,382
She's the whore
I told you about.

209
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,234
The dark-haired one.

210
00:16:44,936 --> 00:16:47,905
Have her brought to the Tower
of the Hand before the wedding.

211
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,751
A book?

212
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,220
"The Lives of Four Kings."
Grand Maester Kaeth's history

213
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,555
of the reigns of
Daeron the Young Dragon,

214
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:09,060
Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the
Unworthy, and Daeron the Good.

215
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,762
A book every king should read.

216
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:21,939
Now that the war is won,

217
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,159
we should all find
time for wisdom.

218
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,446
Thank you, Uncle.

219
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,710
One of only two Valyrian
steel swords in the capital,

220
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:46,631
Your Grace, freshly
forged in your honor.

221
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:03,464
Careful, Your Grace. Nothing
cuts like Valyrian steel.

222
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,783
So they say.

223
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:19,380
Such a great sword
should have a name.

224
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:22,216
- What shall I call her?
<i>- Stormbringer.</i>

225
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,385
<i>- Terminus.</i>
<i>- Widow's Wail.</i>

226
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,921
<i>- Wolfsbane.</i>
- Widow's Wail. I like that.

227
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,342
Every time I use it,
it'll be like cutting off

228
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,016
Ned Stark's head
all over again.

229
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:03,257
Don't.

230
00:19:05,294 --> 00:19:07,345
You want me on the desk?

231
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:13,017
- <i> What's wrong, my lion?</i>
- Don't call me that.

232
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,720
What should I call you?

233
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:18,723
I'm afraid our friendship
can't continue.

234
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,525
Our friendship?

235
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,894
There's a ship waiting in
the harbor bound for Pentos.

236
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:25,146
What?

237
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,614
You'll have your own
cabin, of course,

238
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:31,035
and across the Narrow Sea
a house, servants.

239
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:33,738
What is this?

240
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,957
I'm a married man.

241
00:19:35,991 --> 00:19:38,876
My wife has suffered a great
deal, as you well know.

242
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:42,046
<i>I don't want her to suffer
anymore on my account.</i>

243
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,248
I need to uphold my vows.

244
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:46,918
She doesn't want you.

245
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,587
- <i> I need to do right by her.</i>
- You don't want her.

246
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,305
By our children.

247
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,676
- What are you afraid of?
- I'm not afraid.

248
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:59,129
You are. You are afraid of
your father and your sister.

249
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:01,816
- You're going to run from them all your life?
- I need you to leave.

250
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,852
I'm not afraid of them.
I'm not going to run.

251
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,238
- Shae.
- We will fight them together.

252
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,640
It's like you said,
I am yours and you are mine.

253
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:11,776
You're a whore!

254
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,998
Sansa is fit to bear
my children and you are not.

255
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:19,500
I can't be in love
with a whore.

256
00:20:19,534 --> 00:20:21,953
I can't have children
with a whore.

257
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,672
How many men
have you been with?

258
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:26,958
500? 5,000?

259
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,249
How many whores
have you been with?

260
00:20:35,284 --> 00:20:37,435
I have enjoyed my time
with all of them

261
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,553
and I have enjoyed my time
with you most of all.

262
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,889
But now that time is over.

263
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:00,875
You'll have a comfortable
life in Pentos.

264
00:21:02,878 --> 00:21:05,746
Bronn will escort you
to your ship.

265
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:33,741
Hear us now.

266
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:36,360
Accept these tokens
of our faith, my lord,

267
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:38,329
and lead us from the darkness.

268
00:21:39,915 --> 00:21:42,583
Sire, I served you well.

269
00:21:42,617 --> 00:21:45,536
<i>Lord of Light,</i>
<i>show us the way...</i>

270
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:50,007
Selyse, you're my sister!

271
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,575
Yours are the stars
that guide us.

272
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:54,211
Tell him!
Tell him!

273
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,430
<i>Lord of Light, protect us,</i>

274
00:21:56,465 --> 00:21:58,306
for the night is dark
and full of terrors.

275
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,813
Did you see?
Their souls.

276
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,282
It was their souls.

277
00:22:15,317 --> 00:22:18,369
Our lord took them.
Did you see?

278
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:27,945
Lord Florent was
your brother by law.

279
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:30,247
He was an infidel.

280
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:32,750
He worshipped the gods
of his fathers

281
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,952
and their fathers before him.

282
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,621
They were the gods
of your fathers, too.

283
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:39,957
I ordered him to tear
down his idols.

284
00:22:39,975 --> 00:22:41,425
He disobeyed.

285
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:43,761
How many ships did he
bring to your cause?

286
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,062
How many men?

287
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,431
A good deal more than you.

288
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,735
Did you see, Ser Davos?

289
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,069
They're with our lord now.

290
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,638
Their sins all burned away.
Did you see?

291
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:57,324
I'm sure they're more
than grateful, my queen.

292
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,374
Meat's off.

293
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,161
Our larders are almost empty.

294
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:19,213
Serve fish, then.
We're on an island.

295
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,831
You hate fish.

296
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:23,634
I hate a good many things,
but I suffer them all the same.

297
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:29,056
When Storm's End was under
siege and I was starving,

298
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:33,194
<i>Stannis boiled soup</i>
<i>for me from books.</i>

299
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:36,313
The binding glue
is made from horses.

300
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:43,871
One morning, he shot two
seagulls on the beach.

301
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:47,575
I've never tasted anything
as good as grilled seagull.

302
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,328
- Do you remember?
- Of course I remember.

303
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,634
Have you ever known
true hunger, my lady?

304
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,869
<i>It's all I knew</i>
<i>when I was a child.</i>

305
00:23:58,887 --> 00:24:01,055
Until you found
the Lord of Light?

306
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:03,641
Until he found me.

307
00:24:10,548 --> 00:24:12,766
I fear for our daughter's soul.

308
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,366
<i>Every mother should fear</i>
<i>for her child's soul.</i>

309
00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:18,522
- She's a stubborn little beast.
- She's a child.

310
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:20,658
You barely know her.

311
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:23,560
You think she's sweet because
she smiles when you visit.

312
00:24:23,578 --> 00:24:25,863
She's sullen and stubborn
and sinful.

313
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,916
Why else would the Lord of Light
have seen fit to mark her face?

314
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,501
She needs the rod.

315
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:34,004
She's my daughter.
You will not strike her.

316
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,041
As you command.

317
00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:41,545
Perhaps the Lady Melisandre
could speak with her.

318
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:50,938
Come in.

319
00:24:53,108 --> 00:24:55,392
Were you sleeping, Princess?

320
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,399
Did you watch the ceremony
on the beach?

321
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:04,818
I heard it.

322
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,453
And it frightened you?

323
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:08,372
Ser Axel was my uncle.

324
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,658
<i>He was always kind to me.</i>

325
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,660
They're in a better
place now, Princess.

326
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,546
<i>The fire cleansed them</i>
<i>of the sins of the world.</i>

327
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,164
But they screamed.

328
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,216
Women scream
when they give birth.

329
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,835
Afterward they are
filled with joy.

330
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,567
Afterward they aren't
ash and bone.

331
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,589
You have so many
questions, don't you?

332
00:25:25,623 --> 00:25:27,808
<i>So did I when I was a child.</i>

333
00:25:27,842 --> 00:25:30,177
I was much like you.

334
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,813
Only I wasn't a princess.

335
00:25:32,847 --> 00:25:34,431
And you didn't have this.

336
00:25:34,465 --> 00:25:36,317
No.

337
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:39,270
But I suffered in other ways,
sweet girl, believe me.

338
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:41,689
What do you know of the gods?

339
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,991
I read
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

340
00:25:44,025 --> 00:25:46,810
Lies and fables.

341
00:25:46,828 --> 00:25:49,863
Septons speak of seven gods.

342
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,448
There are but two...

343
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:53,867
a god of light and love and joy

344
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,538
and a god of darkness,
evil, and fear.

345
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,323
Eternally at war.

346
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:03,344
There are no seven heavens
and no seven hells?

347
00:26:04,662 --> 00:26:07,131
There's only one hell,
Princess.

348
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:10,334
The one we live in now.

349
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:47,504
<i>Hodor.</i>

350
00:26:51,593 --> 00:26:52,843
Why did you wake me?

351
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:55,813
You've been gone for hours.

352
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,481
I was hungry.

353
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,566
We're all hungry.

354
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:01,318
I was just eating.

355
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:04,355
Summer was eating.

356
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:07,358
Your body can't live on
the food your wolf consumes.

357
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:10,527
<i>Spending too much time in
Summer's skin is dangerous.</i>

358
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:13,914
You're not a direwolf, Bran.

359
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:18,902
Must be glorious, though.

360
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,589
To run, to leap, to hunt.

361
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:25,609
To be whole.

362
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,412
<i>I know that's tempting,</i>

363
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,714
but if you're trapped
in Summer for too long,

364
00:27:30,748 --> 00:27:32,599
you'll forget what it was
to be human.

365
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,722
You'd forget us, Bran.

366
00:27:38,756 --> 00:27:40,641
You'd forget your mother
and father.

367
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,693
You'd forget your brothers
and sisters.

368
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,445
You'd forget Winterfell.

369
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:46,397
You'd forget you.

370
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:50,567
And if we lose you,
we lose everything.

371
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:25,269
Hodor, take me to the tree.

372
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,486
<i>Look for me...</i>

373
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:22,493
<i>beneath the tree.</i>

374
00:29:26,414 --> 00:29:28,698
<i>He saw us.</i>

375
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,004
<i>North.</i>

376
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:45,682
I know where we have to go.

377
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:36,116
Let it be known
that Margaery of House Tyrell

378
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,037
<i>and Joffrey of the Houses</i>
<i>Lannister and Baratheon</i>

379
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:43,907
are one heart, one flesh,
one soul.

380
00:30:43,941 --> 00:30:46,577
<i>Cursed be he</i>

381
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:49,830
<i>who would seek</i>
<i>to tear them asunder.</i>

382
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:56,303
With this kiss,
I pledge my love.

383
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:19,743
We have a new queen.

384
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:23,664
Better her than you.

385
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,795
- Bit much, wouldn't you say?
- It feels proportionate.

386
00:31:38,829 --> 00:31:41,965
- Proportionate to what?
- The expected extravagance.

387
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,434
People who spend their money
on this sort of nonsense

388
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:46,053
tend not to have it for long.

389
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:49,306
You ought to try enjoying
something before you die.

390
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,891
You might find it suits you.

391
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:54,561
Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin
and I are speaking.

392
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:57,030
Anyway, I don't know what
you're complaining about.

393
00:31:57,065 --> 00:31:58,448
I'm paying my share.

394
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,784
Shall we stick golden roses
in half the meat pies

395
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,486
to commemorate your generosity?

396
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,989
No, your heartfelt thank-you
is its own reward.

397
00:32:06,023 --> 00:32:08,992
I would imagine I'd be hearing
it again before long.

398
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,194
Wars are rather expensive.

399
00:32:11,212 --> 00:32:14,214
"The Iron Bank
will have its due."

400
00:32:14,248 --> 00:32:17,000
How they love
to remind everyone.

401
00:32:17,034 --> 00:32:19,703
Almost as much as you
Lannisters with your debts.

402
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:21,688
I'm not worried about
the Iron Bank.

403
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:24,308
We both know
you're smarter than that.

404
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:28,428
Come, Tywin, let us
celebrate young love.

405
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,159
All taken care of.

406
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:45,112
- You saw her board the ship?
- Aye, she's on it.

407
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,030
You saw the ship sail away?

408
00:32:47,064 --> 00:32:50,701
No one knows she's there
but you, me, and Varys.

409
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:52,619
How do you know?

410
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,205
Because if someone follows
me without an invitation,

411
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:56,957
I'm the last person
they ever follow.

412
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:59,092
There's someone following you?

413
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,512
She's gone.

414
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,881
I know you don't want to
believe it, but she is.

415
00:33:04,915 --> 00:33:08,218
Now, go drink till it feels
like you did the right thing.

416
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:16,443
Hello.

417
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:18,979
- Hello.
- Not you.

418
00:33:35,163 --> 00:33:37,280
You look exquisite, child.

419
00:33:37,298 --> 00:33:40,617
The wind has been
at you, though.

420
00:33:40,635 --> 00:33:43,754
I haven't had the
opportunity to tell you

421
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,556
how sorry I was to hear
about your brother.

422
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:50,093
War is war, but killing
a man at a wedding,

423
00:33:50,144 --> 00:33:51,728
horrid.

424
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,980
What sort of monster
would do such a thing?

425
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:57,484
As if men need more
reasons to fear marriage.

426
00:33:57,518 --> 00:33:59,019
My lady.
My lady.

427
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,322
Lord Tyrion, you see?
Not as bad as all that.

428
00:34:02,356 --> 00:34:04,024
Perhaps if your pauper husband

429
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:06,610
were to sell his mule
and his last pair of shoes,

430
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:09,946
he might be able to afford to bring
you to Highgarden for a visit.

431
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,999
Now that peace has come and
all is right with the world,

432
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,118
it would do you good
to see some of it.

433
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:18,121
You must excuse me.
It's time I ate

434
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:20,257
some of this food I paid for.

435
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,797
♪ A coat of gold ♪

436
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,499
♪ Or a coat of red ♪

437
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:35,388
<i>♪ A lion still has claws ♪</i>

438
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,858
♪ And mine,
my lord... ♪

439
00:34:37,892 --> 00:34:40,343
Very good. Very good.
Off you go.

440
00:34:57,078 --> 00:34:59,796
My love, why don't we
make the announcement?

441
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:03,917
Everyone.

442
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:07,754
The queen would like
to say a few words.

443
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,147
We are so fortunate

444
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:19,399
to enjoy this marvelous
food and drink.

445
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:21,935
Not all among us are so lucky.

446
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:25,906
To thank the gods for bringing
the recent war to a just end,

447
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:29,242
King Joffrey has decreed
that the leftovers

448
00:35:29,277 --> 00:35:32,996
from our feast be given
to the poorest in his city.

449
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,877
You're an example to us all.

450
00:36:03,144 --> 00:36:05,145
Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry.

451
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,876
Ser Loras,
it's quite all right.

452
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,601
Your sister looks
very beautiful.

453
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:13,153
<i>As does yours.</i>

454
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:16,272
So, looking forward
to your wedding?

455
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:18,625
Yes, very much.

456
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:21,044
Our fathers are both
rather keen on the prospect.

457
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:22,579
They certainly are.

458
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,373
Perhaps they should
get married.

459
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,501
If you were to marry Cersei,

460
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,136
she'd murder you in your sleep.

461
00:36:30,171 --> 00:36:33,890
If you somehow managed
to put a child in her first,

462
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,059
she'd murder him, too,

463
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:37,794
long before he drew
his first breath.

464
00:36:37,812 --> 00:36:40,931
Luckily for you,
none of this will happen

465
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:43,567
because you'll never marry her.

466
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,521
And neither will you.

467
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:04,204
Your Grace.
My king.

468
00:37:04,238 --> 00:37:06,122
- My queen.
- Lady Brienne.

469
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:08,425
So good of you to come.

470
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:09,876
I'm no lady, Your Grace.

471
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,328
Did you just bow?

472
00:37:12,346 --> 00:37:13,830
Apologies, Your Grace.

473
00:37:13,848 --> 00:37:16,600
I never did master the curtsy.

474
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,218
You're the one who put a sword
through Renly Baratheon.

475
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:21,221
That's not true, my love. Brienne
had nothing to do with it.

476
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:22,973
A shame.

477
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,648
I'd knight the man that put an
end to that deviant's life.

478
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,945
I just wanted
to congratulate you both

479
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,330
and wish you good fortune.

480
00:37:30,364 --> 00:37:32,282
The country has been
at war too long.

481
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:35,535
I hope your reign
is long and peaceful.

482
00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:37,387
- Yes, yes.
- Thank you.

483
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,606
I hope we see more of you.

484
00:37:46,414 --> 00:37:48,465
Lady Brienne.

485
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:51,334
You're Lord Selwyn
Tarth's daughter.

486
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:54,337
That makes you a lady whether
you want to be or not.

487
00:37:54,371 --> 00:37:56,640
As you say, Your Grace.

488
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,091
I owe you my gratitude.

489
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,427
You returned my brother
safely to King's Landing.

490
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:05,265
In truth, he rescued me,
Your Grace.

491
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,033
More than once.

492
00:38:07,068 --> 00:38:09,185
Did he?

493
00:38:10,237 --> 00:38:11,855
Haven't heard
that story before.

494
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:16,059
Not such a fascinating
story, I'm afraid.

495
00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:18,445
I'm sure you have many
fascinating stories.

496
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:22,599
Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark.
And now my brother.

497
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:26,119
Must be exciting to flit
from one camp to the next

498
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,922
serving whichever lord
or lady you fancy.

499
00:38:28,956 --> 00:38:31,508
I don't serve
your brother, Your Grace.

500
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,677
But you love him.

501
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,636
Your Grace.

502
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:58,234
No, no, come to my chambers and
I will examine you personally.

503
00:38:58,268 --> 00:39:00,537
- She'll do no such thing.
- Oh, Your Grace.

504
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,739
Yes, well, this young
lady sought my advice...

505
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,457
You should see Qyburn.
He's quite good.

506
00:39:04,492 --> 00:39:07,610
- Your Grace.
- Qyburn? Deplorable man.

507
00:39:07,628 --> 00:39:11,047
Brought shame on the Citadel
with his repugnant experiments.

508
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,416
More repugnant than your gnarled
fingers on that girl's thighs?

509
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,802
Your Grace,
I am a man of learning.

510
00:39:15,836 --> 00:39:18,638
My little brother had you sent to the
Black Cells when you annoyed him.

511
00:39:18,672 --> 00:39:20,757
What do you think I could do
to you if you annoyed me?

512
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,759
I never meant to annoy anyone.

513
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:25,678
But you are.
You annoy me right now.

514
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,897
Every breath you draw
in my presence annoys me.

515
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,432
So here's what I want
you to do.

516
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:30,984
I want you to leave
my presence.

517
00:39:31,018 --> 00:39:32,468
Leave this wedding right now.

518
00:39:32,486 --> 00:39:34,137
Go to the kitchens
and instruct them

519
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:37,607
that all the leftovers from the feast
will be brought to the kennels.

520
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,859
Your Grace, Queen Margaery...

521
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,245
The<i> queen</i> is telling you

522
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:44,531
the leftovers
will feed the dogs

523
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,783
or you will.

524
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:08,671
A gold dragon to whoever
knocks my fool's hat off.

525
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:22,485
You're in rather a good mood.

526
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:24,821
- I suppose I am.
- I won't ask why.

527
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:28,041
- Small pleasures.
- Your Grace. Lord Tywin.

528
00:40:28,075 --> 00:40:29,626
Prince Oberyn.

529
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,994
I don't believe you
have met Ellaria.

530
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,745
This is the Lord Hand
Tywin Lannister

531
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:35,198
and Cersei Lannister
the Queen Regent.

532
00:40:35,216 --> 00:40:37,917
I suppose it is
former Queen Regent now.

533
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:41,370
Lord Hand and Lady Cersei,

534
00:40:41,388 --> 00:40:45,425
- Ellaria Sand.
- My lord. My lady.

535
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,210
Charmed.

536
00:40:47,228 --> 00:40:49,395
Can't say I've ever
met a Sand before.

537
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:54,767
We are everywhere in Dorne.

538
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:57,153
I have 10,000 brothers
and sisters.

539
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,606
Bastards are born
of passion, aren't they?

540
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,057
We don't despise them in Dorne.

541
00:41:01,075 --> 00:41:02,275
No?
How tolerant of you.

542
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,360
I expect it is a relief,
Lady Cersei,

543
00:41:04,394 --> 00:41:07,080
giving up your regal
responsibilities.

544
00:41:07,114 --> 00:41:10,250
Wearing the crown for so many years
must have left your neck a bit crooked.

545
00:41:10,284 --> 00:41:12,285
I suppose you'll never
know, Prince Oberyn.

546
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:14,254
It's a shame your older brother
couldn't attend the wedding.

547
00:41:14,288 --> 00:41:16,623
Please give him our regards.

548
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,407
With any luck,
the gout will abate

549
00:41:18,425 --> 00:41:20,076
with time and he will
be able to walk again.

550
00:41:20,094 --> 00:41:22,011
They call it
the rich man's disease.

551
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,412
A wonder you don't have it.

552
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,298
Noblemen in my part
of the country

553
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:28,418
don't enjoy the same lifestyle
as our counterparts in Dorne.

554
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,332
People everywhere
have their differences.

555
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:33,556
In some places the highborn
frown upon those of low birth.

556
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:36,893
In other places the rape and
murder of women and children

557
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,862
is considered distasteful.

558
00:41:40,814 --> 00:41:44,117
What a fortunate thing for
you, former Queen Regent,

559
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:46,119
that your daughter
Myrcella has been sent

560
00:41:46,153 --> 00:41:48,488
to live in the latter
sort of place.

561
00:41:51,825 --> 00:41:55,628
Everyone, silence!
Clear the floor.

562
00:41:57,998 --> 00:42:01,784
There's been too much
amusement here today.

563
00:42:01,802 --> 00:42:05,638
A royal wedding
is not an amusement.

564
00:42:05,673 --> 00:42:08,641
A royal wedding is history.

565
00:42:08,676 --> 00:42:11,177
The time has come for all of us

566
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,646
to contemplate our history.

567
00:42:14,648 --> 00:42:16,015
My lords...

568
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:20,403
my ladies...

569
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,723
I give you

570
00:42:23,757 --> 00:42:26,242
King Joffrey...

571
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,745
<i>Renly, Stannis,</i>

572
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:32,165
<i>Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy.</i>

573
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:35,501
The War of the Five Kings.

574
00:42:38,872 --> 00:42:41,007
I'm the rightful king.

575
00:42:42,176 --> 00:42:44,961
- King in the North!
- Yes!

576
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:52,101
<i>Traitor. You're a traitor.</i>

577
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:55,388
<i>For the Seven Kingdoms!</i>

578
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:01,277
Let the war begin.

579
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:06,316
Renly, you're no king.

580
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,569
Away, degenerate.
Away. Away.

581
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,238
Ooh, careful.

582
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,791
- Go on.
- I want you to be my prince.

583
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,300
Stannis!

584
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:26,769
Who's got the gold now, Stark?

585
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:30,139
I am the rightful king.
Challenge me, ruffian.

586
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,975
- Take that.
- I'm drowning. I'm drowning.

587
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:34,427
I am the King in the North!

588
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:40,600
Not wildfire!

589
00:43:48,075 --> 00:43:50,827
Pay each of them 20 gold
when this is done.

590
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,862
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

591
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:55,114
We'll have to find another
way to thank the king.

592
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,287
Charge!

593
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,511
Ready, again.

594
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:14,100
I am the King in the North!

595
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,687
- Charge!
- Charge!

596
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,588
Yes!

597
00:44:19,606 --> 00:44:22,892
<i>Your head!</i>

598
00:44:57,394 --> 00:45:00,296
Fine gentlemen.

599
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:11,023
Well fought.
Well fought.

600
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,943
Here you are.
Champion's purse.

601
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:19,532
Though you're not
the champion yet, are you?

602
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:23,169
A true champion defeats
all the challengers.

603
00:45:23,203 --> 00:45:25,588
Surely there are
others out there

604
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:28,207
who still dare
to challenge my reign.

605
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,326
Uncle.

606
00:45:30,344 --> 00:45:33,596
How about you? I'm sure
they have a spare costume.

607
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:42,688
One taste of combat was
enough for me, Your Grace.

608
00:45:42,723 --> 00:45:45,341
I would like to keep
what remains of my face.

609
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,810
<i>I think you should fight him.</i>

610
00:45:47,844 --> 00:45:49,645
This was but a poor imitation

611
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:51,614
of your own bravery
on the field of battle.

612
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:54,150
I speak as a firsthand witness.

613
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,202
<i>Climb down from the high table</i>

614
00:45:56,236 --> 00:45:58,321
<i>with your new Valyrian sword</i>

615
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:01,524
and show everyone how
a true king wins his throne.

616
00:46:01,542 --> 00:46:03,876
<i>Be careful, though.</i>

617
00:46:03,911 --> 00:46:06,963
This one is clearly
mad with lust.

618
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:10,833
It would be a tragedy for
the king to lose his virtue

619
00:46:10,884 --> 00:46:12,919
hours before his wedding night.

620
00:46:43,617 --> 00:46:45,451
A fine vintage.

621
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:47,236
Shame that it spilled.

622
00:46:47,254 --> 00:46:49,172
It did not spill.

623
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:51,457
My love, come back to me.

624
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:53,259
It's time for
my father's toast.

625
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:57,880
Well, how does he expect me
to toast without wine?

626
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:04,437
Uncle, you can be my cupbearer

627
00:47:04,471 --> 00:47:06,722
seeing as you're
too cowardly to fight.

628
00:47:06,773 --> 00:47:08,975
Your Grace does me
a great honor.

629
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:12,395
It's not meant as an honor.

630
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:45,261
Bring me my goblet.

631
00:48:07,834 --> 00:48:10,202
What good is an empty cup?

632
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:12,755
Fill it.

633
00:48:26,687 --> 00:48:27,887
Kneel.

634
00:48:30,223 --> 00:48:32,642
Kneel before your king.

635
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:39,031
Kneel.

636
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:48,023
I said...

637
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:49,909
kneel!

638
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,897
Look, the pie.

639
00:49:09,429 --> 00:49:10,846
My queen.

640
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:24,827
Wonderful.

641
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:29,098
Wonderful.

642
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,000
<i>My hero.</i>

643
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:37,256
- Can we leave now?
- Let's find out.

644
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:47,099
Uncle.

645
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:52,054
Where are you going?

646
00:49:52,088 --> 00:49:54,607
<i>You're my cupbearer, remember?</i>

647
00:49:54,641 --> 00:49:57,226
I thought I might change out of
these wet clothes, Your Grace.

648
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,895
No, no, no. No, you're
perfect the way you are.

649
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:03,315
Serve me my wine.

650
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:11,290
Well, hurry up.
This pie is dry.

651
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:21,083
Mm, good.

652
00:50:21,134 --> 00:50:23,502
<i>Needs washing down.</i>

653
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:26,088
If it please Your Grace,
Lady Sansa is very tired.

654
00:50:26,122 --> 00:50:28,841
<i>No.</i>

655
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:30,626
No, you'll wait here...

656
00:50:32,962 --> 00:50:36,182
<i>un...</i>

657
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,267
Your Grace?

658
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,655
It's nothing.

659
00:50:48,195 --> 00:50:50,780
- He's choking!
- Help the poor boy.

660
00:50:54,367 --> 00:50:57,253
- Idiots, help your king.
- Move away!

661
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:02,208
- Joffrey! Joffrey!
- Help him!

662
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:04,627
- Someone help him!
- Joffrey!

663
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,181
- Come with me now.
<i>- Joffrey! Joffrey!</i>

664
00:51:09,216 --> 00:51:11,434
If you want to live,
we have to leave.

665
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:12,768
Don't touch him!

666
00:51:18,892 --> 00:51:20,810
Joffrey.

667
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:23,312
Please, Joffrey.

668
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:26,899
Joffrey, what is it?

669
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:29,368
Help him!

670
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:04,103
My son.

671
00:52:09,776 --> 00:52:13,696
<i>He's gone.</i>
<i>Our king is gone.</i>

672
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:15,915
He did this.

673
00:52:18,451 --> 00:52:21,670
He poisoned my son,

674
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,372
your king.

675
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:26,041
Take him.
Take him!

676
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,761
Take him!

677
00:52:28,795 --> 00:52:30,930
Take him!
