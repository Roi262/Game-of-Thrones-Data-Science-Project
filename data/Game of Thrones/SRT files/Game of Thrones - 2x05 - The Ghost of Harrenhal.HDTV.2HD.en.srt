1
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,602
- You swear it?
- By the mother.

2
00:02:12,837 --> 00:02:16,273
My son has no interest
in the Iron Throne.

3
00:02:21,914 --> 00:02:24,950
Then I see no reason
for hostility between us.

4
00:02:24,984 --> 00:02:27,686
Your son can go on calling
himself King in the North,

5
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,257
the Starks will have dominion over
all lands north of Moat Cailin,

6
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,393
provided he swears me
an oath of fealty.

7
00:02:33,427 --> 00:02:34,727
And the wording
of this oath?

8
00:02:34,762 --> 00:02:37,530
The same Ned Stark swore
to Robert 18 years ago.

9
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:43,303
Cat, their friendship held
the kingdoms together.

10
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:50,444
And in return
for my son's loyalty?

11
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:53,614
In the morning I'll destroy
my brother's army.

12
00:02:53,648 --> 00:02:55,115
When that's done,

13
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,551
Baratheon and Stark
will fight

14
00:02:57,585 --> 00:02:59,420
their common enemy
together,

15
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:01,722
as they have done
many times before.

16
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:11,200
Our two houses
have always been close,

17
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:15,037
which is why I am begging you
to reconsider this battle.

18
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,671
Negotiate a peace
with your brother.

19
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:19,440
Negotiate with Stannis?

20
00:03:19,474 --> 00:03:21,242
You heard him out there.

21
00:03:21,276 --> 00:03:24,245
I'd have better luck
debating the wind.

22
00:03:26,014 --> 00:03:28,782
Please bring my terms
to your son.

23
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:31,117
I believe we are
natural allies.

24
00:03:31,152 --> 00:03:32,786
I hope he feels
the same.

25
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,689
Together we could end
this war in a fortnight.

26
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,675
No!

27
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:58,513
- No.
<i>- Follow me!</i>

28
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:04,485
- You'll die for this.
- No, wait, it wasn't her!

29
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,166
- You'll-.
- No, wa-

30
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,332
We've got to leave.

31
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:53,667
They'll hang you
for this.

32
00:04:53,702 --> 00:04:56,804
<i>- Inside the King's tent, go!</i>
- Now!

33
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,874
I won't leave him.

34
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:04,279
You can't avenge him
if you're dead.

35
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:07,549
<i>Over there, go!</i>

36
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,818
Not that way.

37
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:46,123
We need to go home.

38
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:49,159
- Loras.
- My Lord, My Lady.

39
00:05:49,193 --> 00:05:50,694
Get out.

40
00:05:50,728 --> 00:05:52,896
Stannis will be here
in an hour.

41
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,699
When he arrives, Renly's
bannermen will flock to him.

42
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:57,935
<i>Your former companions</i>
<i>will fight for the privilege</i>

43
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:00,470
of selling you
to their new king.

44
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:02,372
And you want that
privilege for yourself.

45
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:05,809
You will note that I am
standing here talking to you,

46
00:06:05,844 --> 00:06:08,012
- not Stannis.
- There's no time for this.

47
00:06:08,046 --> 00:06:09,514
Ride back to
Highgarden, sister.

48
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:11,616
I'm not running
from Stannis.

49
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:12,885
<i>Brienne of Tarth</i>
<i>murdered Renly.</i>

50
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:16,221
I don't believe that.
You don't believe that.

51
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,325
Who gained the most
from our king's death?

52
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:22,327
Stannis.

53
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:24,261
I will put a sword
through his righteous face.

54
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:26,564
You can't stay here.

55
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:29,233
He would have been
a true king,

56
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:31,569
a good king.

57
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:33,438
<i>Tell me, Ser Loras,</i>

58
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:36,074
what do you desire
most in this world?

59
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:37,942
Revenge.

60
00:06:37,976 --> 00:06:40,611
I have always found that to
be the purest of motivations,

61
00:06:40,645 --> 00:06:44,181
but you won't have a chance to
put your sword through Stannis,

62
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:45,782
<i>not today.</i>

63
00:06:45,816 --> 00:06:48,017
<i>You'll be cut to pieces before</i>
<i>he sets foot on solid ground.</i>

64
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:50,286
If it is justice
that you want,

65
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,753
be smart about it.

66
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:54,289
You can't avenge him
from the grave.

67
00:06:56,058 --> 00:06:58,393
Bring the horses.

68
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,598
Please.

69
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:32,498
He was very handsome.

70
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:35,066
He was, Your Grace.

71
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:37,235
"Your Grace."

72
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:41,172
Calling yourself king
doesn't make you one.

73
00:07:41,206 --> 00:07:44,508
And if Renly wasn't a king,
I wasn't a queen.

74
00:07:46,044 --> 00:07:47,944
Do you want to be a queen?

75
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:50,080
No.

76
00:07:51,282 --> 00:07:53,916
I want to be <i>the</i> queen.

77
00:08:05,464 --> 00:08:07,733
Killed?
By whom?

78
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:09,335
<i>Accounts differ.</i>

79
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:12,071
Most seem to implicate
Catelyn Stark in some way.

80
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:13,873
Really?
Who'd have thought?

81
00:08:13,907 --> 00:08:16,074
Some say it was one
of his own Kingsguard,

82
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:19,010
while still others say it was
Stannis himself who did it

83
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:21,012
after negotiations
went sour.

84
00:08:21,046 --> 00:08:23,080
Whomever did it,
I say well done.

85
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:24,548
It's not what Varys says.

86
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,218
He says Renly's army is
<i>flocking to support Stannis,</i>

87
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:31,188
which would give Stannis superiority
over us on both land and sea.

88
00:08:31,222 --> 00:08:33,723
Littlefinger says we can
outspend him three to one.

89
00:08:33,758 --> 00:08:36,593
And I say father raised you to
have too much respect for money.

90
00:08:36,627 --> 00:08:38,995
<i>Stannis Baratheon</i>
<i>is coming for us,</i>

91
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,430
sooner rather than later.

92
00:08:40,464 --> 00:08:41,832
Aren't there other things
you should be doing,

93
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:44,101
like sealing my daughter in a crate
so you can ship her away?

94
00:08:44,135 --> 00:08:45,473
She'll be safer in Dorne.

95
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:47,205
Yes, I know how concerned
you are for her safety.

96
00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:49,040
It so happens that I am.

97
00:08:49,074 --> 00:08:50,809
Myrcella is a sweet,
innocent girl

98
00:08:50,843 --> 00:08:52,744
and I don't blame her
at all for you.

99
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:55,380
So clever.

100
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:57,883
Aren't you
always so clever

101
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:00,185
with your schemes
and your plots?

102
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:03,254
Schemes and plots
are the same thing.

103
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:05,290
They are going
to attack us.

104
00:09:05,324 --> 00:09:06,924
We need to be ready.

105
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,426
No need to concern
yourself over it.

106
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:12,796
The King is taking personal
charge of siege preparations.

107
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:16,466
May I ask specifically
what the King has in mind?

108
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,936
You may specifically
or you may ask vaguely.

109
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,204
The answer will be
the same.

110
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,680
It's important
that we talk about this.

111
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:34,586
It's the King's
royal prerogative

112
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,557
to withhold sensitive information
from his councilors.

113
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,235
<i>It's wildfire.</i>

114
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:51,004
Wildfire?

115
00:09:52,573 --> 00:09:55,109
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you, cousin?

116
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:57,878
- No.
- That's a lie right there.

117
00:09:57,912 --> 00:10:00,080
It is not a lie.
Why would I lie?

118
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:02,382
Tell me,

119
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:04,118
if the vile allegations

120
00:10:04,152 --> 00:10:06,687
against my brother
and sister are true,

121
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:09,089
do you think it will
make Jaime more likely

122
00:10:09,123 --> 00:10:11,458
to kill you or less likely?

123
00:10:11,493 --> 00:10:14,179
When I tell him
you're fucking her, I mean.

124
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:15,962
I'm telling you the truth.

125
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:17,515
The smart money
would be on more likely.

126
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,098
She's making wildfire.

127
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:21,734
But then perhaps his own unnatural
urges will give him sympathy for yours.

128
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:23,202
The alchemists' guild
is being commissioned.

129
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:24,937
I suppose there's only
one way to find out.

130
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:27,572
They have thousands of pots
already stored in their vaults.

131
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:29,741
They are planning to launch
them from the city walls

132
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:31,576
into Stannis's ships
and armies.

133
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,245
<i>Please.</i>

134
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,147
When did she
tell you this?

135
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:40,652
I heard her talking
with the Pyromancer.

136
00:10:40,686 --> 00:10:44,523
And the other night
after I left her,

137
00:10:44,557 --> 00:10:46,826
she went to meet him.

138
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,796
- I swear to you.
- Swear to me on what?

139
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,566
- On my life.
- But I don't care about your life.

140
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,602
In the Light of the Seven,

141
00:10:54,636 --> 00:10:56,637
by all that is
holy and right,

142
00:10:56,671 --> 00:10:59,139
I, Lancel Lannister,
do solemnly vow--

143
00:10:59,173 --> 00:11:00,569
All right, all right.
Enough.

144
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:02,594
Even torturing
you is boring.

145
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:05,545
<i>Just get out.</i>

146
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:10,148
Oh, Lancel,
tell my friend Bronn

147
00:11:10,183 --> 00:11:13,185
to please kill you if anything
should happen to me.

148
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:16,287
Please kill me if anything
should happen to Lord Tyrion.

149
00:11:18,457 --> 00:11:20,591
It will be my pleasure.

150
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,197
- Your Grace.
- What is it?

151
00:11:27,232 --> 00:11:28,051
Your Grace.

152
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:30,033
I'm sorry about
your brother, Your Grace.

153
00:11:30,034 --> 00:11:32,513
I wanted to let you know
that people grieve for him.

154
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:33,169
Your Grace.

155
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,971
- Fools love a fool.
- Your Grace.

156
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:37,641
I grieve for him as well--
for the boy he was,

157
00:11:37,676 --> 00:11:39,310
not the man
he grew to be.

158
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:41,479
I need to speak to you about
what I saw in that cave.

159
00:11:41,513 --> 00:11:43,075
I thought I made it clear
to you there'd be no need to

160
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,192
speak to me on this matter.

161
00:11:44,193 --> 00:11:45,022
Your Grace, I--

162
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:47,047
I've never known you to
need to hear a thing twice.

163
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:51,256
And I've never known you
to hide from the truth.

164
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,792
You've come to lecture
me on truth?

165
00:11:52,826 --> 00:11:54,527
I've come to tell you
that what I saw--

166
00:11:54,561 --> 00:11:56,662
All my brother's bannermen
have come to my side.

167
00:11:58,532 --> 00:12:01,733
Except the Tyrells,
who fled like cowards.

168
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:03,568
They won't be able
to resist us now.

169
00:12:03,602 --> 00:12:05,470
Soon I shall be sitting
on the Iron Throne.

170
00:12:05,504 --> 00:12:07,338
Nothing is worth
what this will cost you,

171
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:09,807
- not even the Iron--
- I'll hear no more about it.

172
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:20,118
<i>Take a company of men,</i>
<i>secure the perimeter.</i>

173
00:12:20,152 --> 00:12:22,988
When do we sail
for King's Landing?

174
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:25,424
As soon as I've
consolidated my troops.

175
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,326
We'll make short work
of the Lannisters' fleet.

176
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:29,395
Once Blackwater Bay
is cleared,

177
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,532
we'll deliver our troops to their
doorstep and take the city.

178
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:36,269
And will you bring
Lady Melisandre with you?

179
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:39,372
That's not your concern.

180
00:12:39,406 --> 00:12:42,875
If you take King's Landing with her
by your side, the victory will be hers.

181
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:45,277
I never thought I'd have reason to
doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?

182
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:48,213
Loyal service means
telling hard truths.

183
00:12:48,248 --> 00:12:50,582
Oh, truth again.

184
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:53,718
All right,
what's the truth?

185
00:12:53,753 --> 00:12:55,687
The hard truth?

186
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:57,656
<i>She's a foreigner</i>

187
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,791
preaching her
foreign religion.

188
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:04,062
Some believe she whispers orders
in your ear and you obey.

189
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:08,767
What do you believe?

190
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:15,842
You won those bannermen
from Renly.

191
00:13:15,877 --> 00:13:17,944
Don't lose them to her.

192
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:25,718
We set out for King's Landing
without Lady Melisandre.

193
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:31,389
And you lead the fleet
into Blackwater Bay.

194
00:13:31,424 --> 00:13:33,958
Your Grace, I'm honored,
but my time on the sea

195
00:13:33,992 --> 00:13:36,627
was spent evading ships,
not attacking them.

196
00:13:36,661 --> 00:13:38,428
The other lords
won't be happy.

197
00:13:38,463 --> 00:13:41,498
Most of those lords should
consider themselves lucky

198
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:43,600
I don't hang them
for treason.

199
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,239
Hard truths cut
both ways, Ser Davos.

200
00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:06,189
<i>I've got it!</i>
<i>I've got it!</i>

201
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:11,327
<i>So it's that one there</i>
<i>at the top, on the right.</i>

202
00:14:12,796 --> 00:14:15,498
Buy my fruit, My Lord.
Fresh fruit.

203
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:17,333
Stannis has more infantry,

204
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:19,235
more ships, more horses.

205
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,971
What do we have?

206
00:14:21,005 --> 00:14:23,540
There's that mind of yours
you keep going on about.

207
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:26,910
Well, I've never actually been
able to kill people with it.

208
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:29,813
Good thing.
I'd be out of a job.

209
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:32,082
<i>What about your father?</i>

210
00:14:32,116 --> 00:14:35,452
He hasn't sent
a raven in weeks.

211
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:37,054
He's very busy.

212
00:14:37,088 --> 00:14:40,957
Being repeatedly humiliated by
Robb Stark is time-consuming.

213
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:43,359
We won't be able to hold
the city against Stannis,

214
00:14:43,394 --> 00:14:45,228
not the way Joffrey's
planning on holding it.

215
00:14:45,262 --> 00:14:47,430
Corruption, yes.

216
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:52,367
We are swollen,
bloated, foul.

217
00:14:52,402 --> 00:14:55,771
Brother fornicates with sister
in the bed of Kings

218
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:58,707
and we're surprised when the
fruit of their incest is rotten?

219
00:14:59,943 --> 00:15:02,878
Yes, a rotten king.

220
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:05,414
It's hard to argue
with his assessment.

221
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:08,050
Not after what he did
to your birthday present.

222
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:10,786
The King is a lost cause.

223
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,055
It's the rest of us
I'm worried about now.

224
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:16,926
A dancing king, prancing
down his bloodstained halls

225
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,863
to the tune of a twisted
demon monkey.

226
00:15:22,032 --> 00:15:24,934
You have to admire
his imagination.

227
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:28,337
- He's talking about you.
- What?

228
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:30,306
Demon monkey?

229
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:32,442
People think you're pulling
the King's strings.

230
00:15:32,476 --> 00:15:34,678
They blame you
for the city's ills.

231
00:15:34,712 --> 00:15:37,547
Blame me?
I'm trying to save them.

232
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:40,583
You don't need
to convince me.

233
00:15:40,618 --> 00:15:43,186
Demon monkey.

234
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,388
<i>( Seagulls screeching</i>

235
00:16:12,284 --> 00:16:13,884
Yeah, come on.

236
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,486
You're the crew
of the sea bitch?

237
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,256
I'm your commander.
Welcome.

238
00:16:21,426 --> 00:16:22,893
Stop.

239
00:16:22,927 --> 00:16:25,228
Stop!

240
00:16:25,263 --> 00:16:28,431
Your Captain commands
you to stop.

241
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:31,468
Where are we
heading, Captain?

242
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,272
The Stony Shore
to raid their villages.

243
00:16:36,307 --> 00:16:38,675
<i>There'll be spoils</i>
<i>in it for you, and women,</i>

244
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:40,244
if you do your jobs well.

245
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:43,548
And who decides if we've
done our jobs well?

246
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:47,018
I do.

247
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:49,087
Your Captain.

248
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,626
I have been reaving
and raping

249
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,697
since before you left
Balon's balls, Captain.

250
00:16:57,731 --> 00:17:01,868
Don't reckon I've got much use
for your ideas on how to do it.

251
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:05,338
Don't reckon I've got
much use for a captain at all.

252
00:17:05,372 --> 00:17:09,376
I'm thinking I can do the job
of captain real well myself.

253
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,511
All I need is a ship.

254
00:17:11,545 --> 00:17:13,767
You wouldn't know
where I could find myself

255
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:15,792
a ship now, would you?

256
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,654
You could do that,

257
00:17:21,688 --> 00:17:24,056
take the ship,
head out on your own.

258
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,530
And I will hunt you down,
drag you back here in chains,

259
00:17:26,555 --> 00:17:28,093
and hang you for a traitor.

260
00:17:28,094 --> 00:17:30,696
Stop. We yield.

261
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:36,902
Congratulations
on your first command.

262
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:39,672
Thank you. Kind of you
to come see me off.

263
00:17:39,706 --> 00:17:41,173
Oh, I'm not here
for you.

264
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:44,209
I was just on my way
to Red Harbor.

265
00:17:44,244 --> 00:17:48,014
I've got 30 ships. There's
nowhere to put them here.

266
00:17:48,048 --> 00:17:51,316
- Too narrow.
- You'd better get out there.

267
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:53,385
Wouldn't want them
to set sail without you.

268
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:55,287
That would never happen.

269
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:59,324
My crew would wait on deck
for a year if I asked them to.

270
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,860
This lot, though...

271
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:06,098
Enjoy the Stony Shore.

272
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,071
Come on,
I'll take you out.

273
00:18:13,106 --> 00:18:14,907
Who are you?

274
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:17,009
Dagmer, your first mate.

275
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:20,313
Why aren't you with
the rest of them?

276
00:18:20,347 --> 00:18:24,417
Or did they send you to row me
out and dump me halfway in the sea?

277
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:25,852
That would be good
for a laugh.

278
00:18:25,886 --> 00:18:28,755
They're not gonna respect you
until you prove yourself.

279
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,616
And how am I supposed
to prove myself by pillaging

280
00:18:30,641 --> 00:18:32,226
piss-poor fishing villages?

281
00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:34,294
You're not.

282
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:36,497
And yet that's the task
my father has given me

283
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:39,900
to prove that
I'm a true Iron Islander.

284
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:42,202
<i>They're all Iron Islanders.</i>

285
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:45,706
Do they do as they're told
or do they do as they like?

286
00:18:52,747 --> 00:18:55,715
The Stony Shore's not far
from Torrhen's Square.

287
00:18:55,749 --> 00:18:58,385
The seat of the House
of Tallhart--

288
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:01,321
a more impressive prize than
a few fishermen's daughters.

289
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:04,615
What, you don't think
we could take it?

290
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,793
No, we could.

291
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:07,996
We could never hold it
for more than a few days.

292
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,398
As soon as Winterfell got word that
we'd taken Torrhen's Square,

293
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:13,235
the Starks would send
their men to take it back.

294
00:19:14,771 --> 00:19:17,406
And then--

295
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:24,780
take me to my ship.

296
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,920
The Starks have
overextended their lines.

297
00:19:31,955 --> 00:19:34,022
Now that summer's over,
they'll have a hard time

298
00:19:34,057 --> 00:19:36,124
keeping their men
and horses fed.

299
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:38,260
The Starks understand winter
better than we ever will.

300
00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:39,996
The cold won't beat them.

301
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:44,634
Our spies report growing
discontent among the northern lords.

302
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:46,168
They want to return home

303
00:19:46,193 --> 00:19:48,837
and gather the harvest
before the crops turn.

304
00:19:49,341 --> 00:19:52,277
And I'm sure if those same spies
snuck into our own encampments,

305
00:19:52,311 --> 00:19:55,481
they would report growing discontent
amongst the southern lords.

306
00:19:55,515 --> 00:19:58,383
This is war;
No one's content.

307
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,355
We've underestimated
the Stark boy for too long.

308
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,725
He has a good mind for warfare,
his men worship him.

309
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,861
And as long as he keeps
winning battles,

310
00:20:08,895 --> 00:20:12,798
they'll keep believing
he is King in the North.

311
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:14,467
You've been waiting
for him to fail.

312
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:17,036
He is not going to fail,

313
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,039
not without our help.

314
00:20:22,276 --> 00:20:23,709
So how do we stop him?

315
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:26,112
<i>We've worked through</i>
<i>the night, My Lord.</i>

316
00:20:26,146 --> 00:20:28,447
Perhaps we'd profit
from some sleep.

317
00:20:28,482 --> 00:20:30,516
As I think
you would, Reginald.

318
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:32,118
And because
you're my cousin,

319
00:20:32,152 --> 00:20:34,887
I might even let you
wake from that sleep.

320
00:20:36,123 --> 00:20:38,458
Go, I'm sure your wife
must miss you.

321
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,226
My wife's in Lannisport.

322
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,462
Well, then you'd
better start riding.

323
00:20:43,897 --> 00:20:47,501
Go before I change my mind
and send her your head.

324
00:20:47,535 --> 00:20:49,903
If your name
wasn't Lannister,

325
00:20:49,938 --> 00:20:53,507
you'd be scrubbing out pots
in the cook's tent. Go!

326
00:20:56,377 --> 00:20:58,045
Not wine, water.

327
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:00,247
We'll be here
for some time.

328
00:21:05,153 --> 00:21:07,888
Girl.

329
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:09,924
Where are you from?

330
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,826
Maidenpool, My Lord.

331
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:15,230
And who are the Lords
of Maidenpool?

332
00:21:15,264 --> 00:21:19,134
- Remind me.
- House Mooton, My Lord.

333
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:21,203
And what is their Sigil?

334
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:27,143
A red salmon.

335
00:21:27,177 --> 00:21:30,313
I think a Maidenpool girl
would remember that.

336
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:33,450
You're a northerner,
aren't you?

337
00:21:34,652 --> 00:21:37,720
Good. One more time,
where are you from?

338
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,723
Barrowton, My Lord.
House Dustin.

339
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:44,828
Two crossed longaxes
beneath a black crown.

340
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:50,400
And what do they say
of Robb Stark in the North?

341
00:21:52,736 --> 00:21:55,371
They call him
the young wolf.

342
00:21:55,406 --> 00:21:57,841
And?

343
00:21:57,876 --> 00:22:00,677
They say he rides into battle on
the back of a giant Direwolf.

344
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:06,984
They say he can turn into
a wolf himself when he wants.

345
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:08,987
They say he can't be killed.

346
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:11,924
And do you believe them?

347
00:22:13,026 --> 00:22:15,828
No, My Lord.

348
00:22:15,863 --> 00:22:17,997
Anyone can be killed.

349
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:27,340
Fetch that water.

350
00:23:07,915 --> 00:23:10,484
A girl says nothing.

351
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,355
A girl keeps
her mouth closed.

352
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:18,025
<i>No one hears,</i>

353
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:21,929
and friends may talk
in secret, yes?

354
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:27,735
A boy becomes a girl.

355
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,371
I was always a girl.

356
00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:31,607
And I was always aware.

357
00:23:31,641 --> 00:23:34,343
But the girl
keeps secrets.

358
00:23:34,378 --> 00:23:37,379
<i>It is not for a man</i>
<i>to spoil them.</i>

359
00:23:39,382 --> 00:23:41,016
You're one of them now.

360
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:46,220
I should have let you burn.

361
00:23:48,289 --> 00:23:50,790
And you fetch water
for one of them now.

362
00:23:50,825 --> 00:23:54,860
Why is this right for you
and wrong for me?

363
00:23:54,895 --> 00:23:56,596
I didn't have a choice.

364
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,700
You did.
I did.

365
00:24:00,735 --> 00:24:02,369
And here we are.

366
00:24:05,573 --> 00:24:07,407
A man pays his debts.

367
00:24:07,441 --> 00:24:09,776
A man owes three.

368
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,077
Three what?

369
00:24:11,112 --> 00:24:15,549
The Red God takes
what is his, lovely girl.

370
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,652
And only death
may pay for life.

371
00:24:19,788 --> 00:24:22,289
You saved me
and the two I was with.

372
00:24:22,324 --> 00:24:25,226
You stole three deaths
from the Red God.

373
00:24:28,797 --> 00:24:30,965
We have to give them back.

374
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:36,303
Speak three names

375
00:24:36,337 --> 00:24:38,906
and the man
will do the rest.

376
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:42,643
Three lives
I will give you--

377
00:24:42,677 --> 00:24:46,013
no more, no less,
and we're done.

378
00:24:46,047 --> 00:24:48,548
I can name anyone

379
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,884
and you'll kill him?

380
00:24:50,952 --> 00:24:54,588
A man has said.

381
00:24:56,724 --> 00:24:58,158
The one who
tortures everyone.

382
00:24:58,192 --> 00:24:59,892
A man needs a name.

383
00:24:59,927 --> 00:25:02,261
I don't know his name.

384
00:25:02,296 --> 00:25:04,297
They call him
the Tickler.

385
00:25:04,331 --> 00:25:06,498
That is enough.

386
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:10,635
Go now, girl.
Your master is thirsty.

387
00:25:23,983 --> 00:25:25,416
<i>He's not here yet.</i>

388
00:25:25,451 --> 00:25:27,886
He'd have seen us,
blown the horn.

389
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,088
When will he come?

390
00:25:30,123 --> 00:25:32,124
The Halfhand does things
in his own time.

391
00:25:32,158 --> 00:25:34,426
My uncle told me
stories about him.

392
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:36,495
Most of them are true.

393
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:39,198
I heard the Halfhand spent half
of last winter beyond the wall.

394
00:25:39,232 --> 00:25:40,766
The whole winter.

395
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,468
He was north of the Skirling Pass
when the snows came.

396
00:25:43,503 --> 00:25:45,170
Had to wait for the thaw.

397
00:25:45,204 --> 00:25:49,173
So it is possible for someone
to survive out here on their own.

398
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:52,610
Well, possible
for the Halfhand.

399
00:25:52,644 --> 00:25:54,445
Beautiful, isn't it?

400
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,013
Gilly would love it here.

401
00:25:57,048 --> 00:26:00,650
There's nothing more sickening
than a man in love.

402
00:26:28,077 --> 00:26:30,378
<i>About time you did something.</i>

403
00:26:30,412 --> 00:26:33,180
<i>At least you'll keep warm.</i>

404
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,418
The fist
of the First Men.

405
00:26:37,453 --> 00:26:40,956
Think of how old
this place is--

406
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,559
before the Targaryens
defeated the Hendals,

407
00:26:43,593 --> 00:26:46,362
before the Andals took
Westeros from the First Men.

408
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:49,565
Before I die, please,
stop talking.

409
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,835
Thousands and thousands
of years ago,

410
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:54,939
the First Men stood here
where we're standing

411
00:26:54,973 --> 00:26:57,274
all through the long night.

412
00:26:59,344 --> 00:27:01,745
What do you think they
were like, the First Men?

413
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,380
Stupid.

414
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:06,584
Smart people don't find
themselves in places like this.

415
00:27:06,618 --> 00:27:09,153
I think
they were afraid.

416
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:13,224
I think they came here
to get away from something.

417
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:16,794
And I don't think
it worked.

418
00:27:20,665 --> 00:27:22,266
Wildlings?

419
00:27:24,636 --> 00:27:27,004
One blast is for rangers returning.

420
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,706
Wildlings is two blasts.

421
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,209
So you got to stand
there waiting,

422
00:27:32,243 --> 00:27:34,310
<i>wondering.</i>

423
00:27:34,345 --> 00:27:35,979
<i>One blast for friends,</i>

424
00:27:36,014 --> 00:27:38,916
<i>two for foes.</i>

425
00:27:39,918 --> 00:27:46,257
And three
for White Walkers.

426
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:48,193
It's been 1,000 years,

427
00:27:48,227 --> 00:27:50,963
but that's the only time
they blow the horn three times.

428
00:27:50,997 --> 00:27:54,099
But if it's been 1,000 years,
how do you know?

429
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:57,835
- Well...
- I read it in a book.

430
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,971
Look.

431
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:03,273
It's Qhorin Halfhand.

432
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:06,510
Aye, we'll live
another day.

433
00:28:06,544 --> 00:28:09,112
Hurrah.

434
00:28:18,455 --> 00:28:21,324
Take care, My Lord.

435
00:28:21,358 --> 00:28:24,327
I remember reading
an old sailor's proverb--

436
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:27,297
"piss on wildfire
and your cock burns off."

437
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:30,968
Oh, I have not conducted
this experiment.

438
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:33,604
It could well be true.

439
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:35,473
The substance
burns so hot,

440
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:38,642
it melts wood,
stone, even steel,

441
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:41,979
and, of course, flesh.

442
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:46,516
The substance burns so hot,
it melts flesh like tallow.

443
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:53,189
After the dragons died,
wildfire was the key

444
00:28:53,223 --> 00:28:54,991
to the Targaryen power.

445
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:58,061
My companion takes issue.

446
00:28:58,095 --> 00:29:00,430
If I could tell you
how many crazy old men

447
00:29:00,464 --> 00:29:02,599
I've seen pushing carts
around army camps

448
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:06,336
making grand claims about
jars full of pig shit...

449
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:09,606
- No offense meant.
- Our order does not deal in pig shit.

450
00:29:09,641 --> 00:29:12,342
The substance
is fire given form.

451
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:15,945
And we have been perfecting it
since the days of Maegor.

452
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,313
To do what?

453
00:29:17,348 --> 00:29:20,750
The jars are put in catapults
and flung at the enemy.

454
00:29:20,784 --> 00:29:23,452
How much do you have?

455
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:30,124
If you could get real soldiers
to man the catapults,

456
00:29:30,158 --> 00:29:33,526
then maybe you'd hit
your target one time in 10,

457
00:29:33,561 --> 00:29:36,695
but all the real soldiers are in
the Riverlands with your father.

458
00:29:36,729 --> 00:29:39,364
My Lord, this man
is insulting.

459
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:41,700
I don't know if you've
ever seen a battle, old man,

460
00:29:41,735 --> 00:29:43,369
but things can get
a bit messy.

461
00:29:43,403 --> 00:29:44,770
'Cause when we're flinging
things at Stannis,

462
00:29:44,804 --> 00:29:46,572
he's flinging them
right back at us.

463
00:29:46,606 --> 00:29:49,441
Men die, men shit
themselves, men run,

464
00:29:49,475 --> 00:29:51,209
which means
pots falling,

465
00:29:51,244 --> 00:29:53,144
which means fire
inside the walls,

466
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:55,445
which means the poor cunts
trying to defend the city

467
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,470
end up burning it down.

468
00:29:57,682 --> 00:30:00,050
My friend remains
unconvinced.

469
00:30:00,084 --> 00:30:02,419
He would not dare
insult my order

470
00:30:02,453 --> 00:30:04,153
whilst Aerys Targaryen
lived.

471
00:30:04,188 --> 00:30:06,789
Well, he's not
living anymore.

472
00:30:06,823 --> 00:30:09,925
And all his pots of wildfire
didn't help him, did they?

473
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,929
Men win wars,
not magic tricks.

474
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:33,512
We have been working
tirelessly day and night

475
00:30:33,547 --> 00:30:38,016
ever since your royal sister
commanded us to do so.

476
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,185
Our present count stands

477
00:30:40,219 --> 00:30:43,721
at 7,811,

478
00:30:43,755 --> 00:30:47,224
enough to burn Stannis
Baratheon's fleet

479
00:30:47,258 --> 00:30:49,359
and armies both.

480
00:30:49,394 --> 00:30:52,095
This is a shit idea.

481
00:30:52,129 --> 00:30:55,998
I'm afraid I have to concur
with my advisor, wisdom Hallyne.

482
00:30:56,033 --> 00:31:00,269
The contents of this room
could lay King's Landing low.

483
00:31:01,905 --> 00:31:05,640
You won't be making wildfire
for my sister any longer.

484
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:09,878
You'll be making it
for me.

485
00:31:18,755 --> 00:31:21,023
Dracarys.

486
00:31:28,565 --> 00:31:31,000
Dracarys.

487
00:31:40,645 --> 00:31:43,447
He'll be able to feed
himself from now on.

488
00:31:46,784 --> 00:31:49,352
<i>Let him sleep, Doreah.</i>

489
00:31:49,387 --> 00:31:52,156
Yes, Khaleesi.

490
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,327
He loves you.

491
00:32:07,206 --> 00:32:09,408
Thank you, my friend.

492
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:14,580
Did you see the dress
Xaro had made for you?

493
00:32:14,614 --> 00:32:17,649
They say he's the
wealthiest man in Qarth.

494
00:32:17,683 --> 00:32:19,918
It is known.

495
00:32:19,953 --> 00:32:22,955
And if Qarth is the wealthiest
city in Essos--

496
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,890
The last time a rich man
gave me a dress,

497
00:32:24,924 --> 00:32:27,659
he was selling me
to Khal Drogo.

498
00:32:33,432 --> 00:32:37,035
Xaro is our host,
but we know nothing about him.

499
00:32:37,069 --> 00:32:39,838
Men like to talk
about other men

500
00:32:39,872 --> 00:32:41,874
when they're happy.

501
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:51,517
You would look like
a real princess in Xaro's--

502
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,588
She's not a princess.
She's a Khaleesi.

503
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,862
You should wear it,
Khaleesi.

504
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:04,363
You are their guest.

505
00:33:04,397 --> 00:33:06,999
It would be rude not to.

506
00:33:27,354 --> 00:33:29,222
And you must visit
the night market.

507
00:33:29,256 --> 00:33:34,094
The Qartheen night market is like
no night market you've ever seen.

508
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:35,997
It sounds wonderful.

509
00:33:36,031 --> 00:33:37,999
The Meereens think
they have a night market.

510
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:40,301
I will take you
there myself.

511
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:43,771
Please excuse me
for a moment.

512
00:33:46,175 --> 00:33:48,510
What are they doing?

513
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:52,280
Malakko says the statue
is too heavy to carry.

514
00:33:52,315 --> 00:33:53,649
Kovarro says that
Malakko is an idiot.

515
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:56,385
<i>They can pry out the gems,</i>
<i>the rest is pure gold.</i>

516
00:33:56,419 --> 00:34:00,022
Very soft. He can chop off
as much as we can carry.

517
00:34:27,685 --> 00:34:30,553
My brother used to say the only
thing the Dothraki knew how to do

518
00:34:30,587 --> 00:34:32,622
was steal things
better men have built.

519
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:34,357
It's not the only thing.

520
00:34:34,391 --> 00:34:36,192
They're quite good
at killing the better men.

521
00:34:36,226 --> 00:34:39,228
That's not the kind of queen
I'm going to be.

522
00:34:39,262 --> 00:34:42,131
Mother of Dragons.

523
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:44,367
On behalf of the warlocks
of Qarth,

524
00:34:44,401 --> 00:34:46,502
I welcome you.

525
00:34:47,737 --> 00:34:49,738
A demonstration?

526
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:54,877
Take this gem.
Look at it.

527
00:34:56,246 --> 00:34:58,647
Into its depths.

528
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:01,016
So many facets.

529
00:35:01,051 --> 00:35:05,187
Look closely enough and you
can see yourself in them.

530
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:09,691
Often more than once.

531
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:16,564
Should you grow tired of
Xaro's baubles and trinkets,

532
00:35:16,598 --> 00:35:19,934
it would be an honor to host you
at the House of the Undying.

533
00:35:19,968 --> 00:35:22,403
You're always welcome,

534
00:35:22,437 --> 00:35:25,106
Mother of Dragons.

535
00:35:31,647 --> 00:35:33,982
My apologies.

536
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,584
Pyat Pree is one
of the Thirteen.

537
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:39,020
It was customary for me
to extend him an invitation.

538
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:42,189
Customs die
slow deaths in Qarth.

539
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,991
What is the House
of the Undying?

540
00:35:45,026 --> 00:35:48,628
It is where the warlocks go
to squint at dusty books

541
00:35:48,662 --> 00:35:50,229
and drink shade
of the evening.

542
00:35:50,264 --> 00:35:54,333
It turns their lips blue
and their minds soft--

543
00:35:54,367 --> 00:35:57,235
so soft,
they actually believe

544
00:35:57,269 --> 00:35:59,270
their parlor tricks
are magic.

545
00:36:02,942 --> 00:36:05,577
<i>You watch over her.</i>

546
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,148
Do I know you?

547
00:36:09,182 --> 00:36:11,084
I know you.

548
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:14,654
Jorah Mormont
of Bear Island.

549
00:36:14,688 --> 00:36:16,423
Who are you?

550
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:18,759
I'm no one.

551
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:20,761
But she is
the Mother of Dragons.

552
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:24,398
She needs true protectors
now more than ever.

553
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,400
They shall come
day and night

554
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,936
to see the wonder born
into the world again.

555
00:36:28,971 --> 00:36:32,474
And when they see,
they shall lust,

556
00:36:32,508 --> 00:36:36,311
for dragons are fire
made flesh.

557
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:38,947
And fire is power.

558
00:36:49,258 --> 00:36:51,526
It looked like Stannis.

559
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,995
To me it just
looked like...

560
00:36:58,434 --> 00:37:01,102
A shadow in
the shape of a man.

561
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,171
In the shape
of Stannis.

562
00:37:07,544 --> 00:37:10,246
We should reach
my son's camp tomorrow.

563
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,381
Will you stay there
long, My Lady?

564
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:16,085
Only long enough to tell
Robb what I have seen.

565
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,422
After that, I will leave
for Winterfell.

566
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,758
My two youngest need me.

567
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:25,927
I've been away from them
for far too long.

568
00:37:25,961 --> 00:37:28,863
I never knew my mother.

569
00:37:29,898 --> 00:37:31,398
I'm sorry.

570
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:35,135
My own mother died
on the birthing bed

571
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,004
when I was very young.

572
00:37:41,242 --> 00:37:43,777
It's a bloody business.

573
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:47,347
What comes after
is even harder.

574
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:52,152
Once you're safely back
amongst your own people,

575
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:55,322
will you give me leave
to go, My Lady?

576
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,558
You mean to kill Stannis.

577
00:37:57,592 --> 00:37:59,226
I swore a vow.

578
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,529
But Stannis has
a great army around him.

579
00:38:02,563 --> 00:38:05,065
His own guards are sworn
to keep him safe.

580
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:06,966
<i>I'm as good</i>
<i>as any of them.</i>

581
00:38:08,436 --> 00:38:09,869
I should never have fled.

582
00:38:09,904 --> 00:38:13,639
Renly's death
was no fault of yours.

583
00:38:13,673 --> 00:38:15,507
You served him bravely.

584
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:19,546
I only held him
that once

585
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,215
as he was dying.

586
00:38:24,685 --> 00:38:26,319
He's gone, Brienne.

587
00:38:26,354 --> 00:38:30,958
You serve nothing and no one
by following him into the earth.

588
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:35,330
Renly's enemies are
Robb's enemies as well.

589
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:42,003
I do not know
your son, My Lady...

590
00:38:44,206 --> 00:38:48,175
but I could serve you
if you would have me.

591
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:50,277
<i>You have courage.</i>

592
00:38:50,311 --> 00:38:52,779
Not battle courage, perhaps,

593
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:56,249
but, I don't know,

594
00:38:56,284 --> 00:38:58,184
a woman's kind of courage.

595
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:00,721
<i>And I think that</i>
<i>when the time comes,</i>

596
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,222
<i>you will not hold me back.</i>

597
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,959
Promise me that you
will not hold me back

598
00:39:04,993 --> 00:39:07,328
from Stannis.

599
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,203
When the time comes,
I will not hold you back.

600
00:39:21,811 --> 00:39:24,145
Then I am yours,
My Lady.

601
00:39:25,247 --> 00:39:26,748
I will shield your back

602
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:29,851
and give my life for yours
if it comes to that.

603
00:39:29,885 --> 00:39:33,487
I swear it by the Old Gods
and the new.

604
00:39:40,429 --> 00:39:43,999
I vow that you shall always
have a place in my home

605
00:39:44,034 --> 00:39:46,001
and at my table

606
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:48,470
and that I shall ask
no service of you

607
00:39:48,505 --> 00:39:51,073
that might
bring you dishonor.

608
00:39:51,107 --> 00:39:54,176
I swear it by the Old Gods
and the new.

609
00:39:57,447 --> 00:39:59,647
<i>And it's not</i>
<i>just thieves, My Lord.</i>

610
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:02,852
<i>There's wolves</i>
<i>in them hills now,</i>

611
00:40:02,886 --> 00:40:05,187
more than I've ever seen.

612
00:40:05,222 --> 00:40:08,258
They come down in the night
and they kill my sheep.

613
00:40:08,292 --> 00:40:12,128
My three sons is away fighting
for your brother, My Lord.

614
00:40:12,162 --> 00:40:14,363
They'll fight,
keep fighting

615
00:40:14,397 --> 00:40:16,532
till they're told
to go home.

616
00:40:16,566 --> 00:40:19,168
I have no one to man
my flock now. Only me.

617
00:40:19,202 --> 00:40:22,837
I can't keep watch
all day and all night.

618
00:40:24,874 --> 00:40:27,675
We can send two orphan boys
from Winterstown home with you

619
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,443
to help watch over
your flock

620
00:40:29,478 --> 00:40:31,278
if you can give them
room and board.

621
00:40:31,313 --> 00:40:34,014
My wife always prayed
for more children.

622
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,416
We'll look after them.
Thank you, My Lord.

623
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:39,787
And may the Gods
bless you and yours.

624
00:40:42,658 --> 00:40:44,793
Stop it.

625
00:40:44,827 --> 00:40:48,130
If that's everyone, I'm going
to go for a ride before dark.

626
00:40:48,164 --> 00:40:50,166
- Good.
- Hodor.

627
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,137
- Hodor.
Bran-- Lord Stark.

628
00:40:54,172 --> 00:40:55,906
Torrhen's Square
is under siege.

629
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,608
Torrhen's Square is barely
40 leagues from here.

630
00:40:58,642 --> 00:41:01,711
<i>How can the Lannisters</i>
<i>strike so far north?</i>

631
00:41:01,746 --> 00:41:04,347
Might be a raiding party
led by the Mountain.

632
00:41:04,381 --> 00:41:06,882
Might be Sellswords
paid by Tywin Lannister.

633
00:41:06,917 --> 00:41:08,150
We have to help them.

634
00:41:08,185 --> 00:41:09,685
Most of the fighting men
are away with Robb,

635
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,420
but I can gather
200 decent men.

636
00:41:11,454 --> 00:41:12,681
Do you need so many?

637
00:41:12,706 --> 00:41:14,223
If we can't protect
our own bannermen,

638
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:17,026
why should
they protect us?

639
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,829
Go, Ser Rodrik.
Take the men you need.

640
00:41:19,864 --> 00:41:21,331
Won't take long, My Lord.

641
00:41:21,365 --> 00:41:23,166
Southerners don't
do well up here.

642
00:41:33,579 --> 00:41:36,114
So, what does it mean?

643
00:41:36,148 --> 00:41:37,190
Ask your Maester Luwin.

644
00:41:37,215 --> 00:41:39,369
He's the one studying
books all the time.

645
00:41:39,518 --> 00:41:42,854
I did ask him. He'd never
heard of a three-eyed raven.

646
00:41:42,888 --> 00:41:46,491
- Must not mean anything, then
- You're lying.

647
00:41:46,525 --> 00:41:49,293
You might be a little lord,
but don't you call me a liar.

648
00:41:49,327 --> 00:41:52,563
- You know what it means.
- I never said I didn't.

649
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:54,531
You didn't give me
an honest answer.

650
00:41:54,566 --> 00:41:57,568
That's not the same
as being a liar.

651
00:41:57,602 --> 00:41:59,203
Well, it's not far off.

652
00:41:59,237 --> 00:42:03,341
So, you've been dreaming
of a three-eyed raven again?

653
00:42:04,777 --> 00:42:08,079
In the Godswood,
you told me you didn't dream.

654
00:42:08,114 --> 00:42:10,148
Now who's a liar?

655
00:42:13,919 --> 00:42:15,954
What did you see
in your dream?

656
00:42:18,391 --> 00:42:20,659
Something bad?

657
00:42:20,693 --> 00:42:22,894
Tell me, boy.

658
00:42:26,232 --> 00:42:29,167
I dreamt that the sea
came to Winterfell.

659
00:42:30,603 --> 00:42:33,070
I saw waves crashing
against the gates

660
00:42:33,105 --> 00:42:36,807
and the water came
flowing over the walls...

661
00:42:39,144 --> 00:42:41,646
<i>flooded the castle.</i>

662
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:46,050
Drowned men
were floating here

663
00:42:46,084 --> 00:42:48,219
in the yard.

664
00:42:50,789 --> 00:42:53,825
Ser Rodrik
was one of them.

665
00:42:55,861 --> 00:42:58,563
The sea is hundreds
of miles away.

666
00:42:58,598 --> 00:43:00,212
I know.

667
00:43:00,213 --> 00:43:01,538
It's just a stupid dream.

668
00:43:01,563 --> 00:43:03,434
I've got to get these
potatoes to the kitchen.

669
00:43:03,435 --> 00:43:04,936
Otherwise they'll put me
in chains again.

670
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:07,372
Osha.

671
00:43:07,406 --> 00:43:09,875
The three-eyed raven,

672
00:43:09,909 --> 00:43:12,378
what do they say about it

673
00:43:12,413 --> 00:43:15,214
north of the wall?

674
00:43:15,249 --> 00:43:18,551
They say all sorts of crazy
things north of the wall.

675
00:43:29,697 --> 00:43:32,098
- There.
<i>- Where?</i>

676
00:43:32,132 --> 00:43:33,899
On that Mountain.

677
00:43:33,933 --> 00:43:36,401
I don't see very well.

678
00:43:36,436 --> 00:43:38,036
A fire.

679
00:43:40,307 --> 00:43:43,309
There's a fire.

680
00:43:43,343 --> 00:43:46,479
<i>The people sitting around it have</i>
<i>better eyes than yours or mine.</i>

681
00:43:46,513 --> 00:43:49,582
When they see us coming,
that fire becomes a signal.

682
00:43:49,616 --> 00:43:53,186
Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time.
to throw a party in our honor.

683
00:43:53,221 --> 00:43:55,289
How many wildlings
have joined him?

684
00:43:55,323 --> 00:43:59,492
From what we can tell,
all of them.

685
00:44:04,064 --> 00:44:06,499
<i>Mance has gathered them all</i>
<i>like deer against the wolves.</i>

686
00:44:06,534 --> 00:44:08,535
<i>They're almost ready</i>
<i>to make their move.</i>

687
00:44:08,569 --> 00:44:10,503
Where?

688
00:44:10,537 --> 00:44:12,372
Somewhere safe.

689
00:44:12,406 --> 00:44:14,240
Somewhere south.

690
00:44:14,274 --> 00:44:17,209
<i>Can't just march</i>
<i>into their midst.</i>

691
00:44:17,243 --> 00:44:19,030
And we can't wait for them
here with nothing but a pile

692
00:44:19,055 --> 00:44:20,880
of stones to protect us.

693
00:44:20,881 --> 00:44:23,817
You saying we should
fall back to the Wall?

694
00:44:23,851 --> 00:44:27,254
Mance was one of us once.

695
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,690
Now he's one of them.

696
00:44:29,725 --> 00:44:32,460
He's gonna teach them
our way of doing things.

697
00:44:32,495 --> 00:44:34,396
They'll hit us in force.

698
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:36,833
And they won't run away
when we hit back.

699
00:44:36,867 --> 00:44:39,302
<i>They're gonna be more</i>
<i>organized than before,</i>

700
00:44:39,336 --> 00:44:41,237
<i>more disciplined</i>

701
00:44:41,271 --> 00:44:43,306
more like us.

702
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,942
So we need to be
more like them,

703
00:44:45,976 --> 00:44:47,877
do things their way.

704
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:51,080
Sneak in, kill Mance,

705
00:44:51,114 --> 00:44:52,715
and scatter them
to the winds

706
00:44:52,749 --> 00:44:54,783
before they can march
on the Wall.

707
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:55,664
And to do that...

708
00:44:55,689 --> 00:44:57,681
We need to get rid
of those lookouts.

709
00:44:57,854 --> 00:44:59,655
It's not a job
for 400 men.

710
00:44:59,689 --> 00:45:03,392
I need to move fast
and silent.

711
00:45:03,426 --> 00:45:07,129
Harker, Stonesnake,
Borba.

712
00:45:08,365 --> 00:45:10,566
Lord Commander, I'd like
to join Lord Qhorin.

713
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,202
I've been called
lots of things,

714
00:45:13,236 --> 00:45:15,124
but that might be
my first Lord Qhorin.

715
00:45:15,605 --> 00:45:18,474
You're a steward,
Snow, not a ranger.

716
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:20,743
I've fought
and killed a Wight.

717
00:45:20,778 --> 00:45:22,979
How many rangers
can say that?

718
00:45:23,014 --> 00:45:25,048
He's the one?

719
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:28,551
Aye.
You killed a Wight.

720
00:45:28,586 --> 00:45:30,453
You also let an old man

721
00:45:30,488 --> 00:45:33,323
beat you bloody
and take your sword.

722
00:45:33,357 --> 00:45:35,692
<i>Craster?</i>

723
00:45:35,726 --> 00:45:38,728
In the boy's defense,
that's a tough old goat.

724
00:45:41,665 --> 00:45:44,467
I could take up Jon's duties
while he's gone, My Lord.

725
00:45:44,501 --> 00:45:47,136
It would be no trouble.

726
00:45:55,178 --> 00:45:58,581
Well, I hope you make
a better ranger

727
00:45:58,615 --> 00:46:00,950
than you do a steward.

728
00:46:02,653 --> 00:46:04,353
Go on.

729
00:46:11,529 --> 00:46:13,364
<i>So, tell me,</i>

730
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:16,501
how long has your manservant
been in love with you?

731
00:46:16,535 --> 00:46:20,238
He's not my manservant
and he's not in love with me.

732
00:46:20,272 --> 00:46:22,340
He's my advisor,

733
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:24,342
my friend.

734
00:46:24,377 --> 00:46:25,911
Unlikely.

735
00:46:25,945 --> 00:46:28,681
I can almost always tell
what a man wants.

736
00:46:28,715 --> 00:46:31,050
And what about
what a woman wants?

737
00:46:31,084 --> 00:46:33,152
Much more complicated.

738
00:46:33,187 --> 00:46:35,221
You, for example,

739
00:46:35,255 --> 00:46:37,824
what do you want?

740
00:46:37,858 --> 00:46:40,894
To cross the Narrow Sea
and take back the Iron Throne.

741
00:46:40,928 --> 00:46:42,462
Why?

742
00:46:42,497 --> 00:46:44,231
Because I promised
my Khalasar I'd protect them

743
00:46:44,265 --> 00:46:46,667
and find them a safe home.

744
00:46:46,701 --> 00:46:50,305
You want to conquer
the Seven Kingdoms?

745
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:52,007
I want them because
they're mine by right.

746
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:55,110
The Iron Throne is mine
and I will take it.

747
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,945
Ah, a conqueror.

748
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,114
And how did you get
all of this?

749
00:46:59,148 --> 00:47:01,183
- Did someone give it to you?
- No.

750
00:47:01,217 --> 00:47:02,717
I come from nothing.

751
00:47:02,752 --> 00:47:04,919
I hit the docks
like a piece of cargo,

752
00:47:04,954 --> 00:47:07,555
except someone normally
cares what happens to cargo.

753
00:47:07,557 --> 00:47:10,291
So you wanted more than
you had and you took it.

754
00:47:10,325 --> 00:47:14,261
You're a conqueror, too.
you're just less ambitious.

755
00:47:15,997 --> 00:47:18,466
Mmm.

756
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,636
What do you want,
Xaro Zhoan Daxos?

757
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:24,372
At the gates of the city,
you bled for me.

758
00:47:24,406 --> 00:47:27,409
Why?

759
00:47:27,443 --> 00:47:29,778
I will show you why.

760
00:47:33,136 --> 00:47:36,339
The door and the vault
is made of Valyrian stone.

761
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,323
The hardest steel
does not make a mark.

762
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,726
I offered the greatest
locksmiths in Qarth

763
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,095
their weight in gold
if they could break into it.

764
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:48,697
I made the same offer
to the greatest thieves.

765
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:51,433
They all went home
empty-handed.

766
00:47:51,467 --> 00:47:54,736
The only thing that
can open this door

767
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,904
is this key.

768
00:47:56,939 --> 00:47:58,373
And behind the door?

769
00:48:01,711 --> 00:48:03,879
And it can all be mine?

770
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:05,581
All?

771
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:09,085
Let us say half.

772
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:13,357
More than enough to buy
horses, ships, armies--

773
00:48:13,392 --> 00:48:15,493
enough to go home.

774
00:48:15,527 --> 00:48:18,430
All I have to do?

775
00:48:18,464 --> 00:48:19,798
Is marry me.

776
00:48:19,832 --> 00:48:22,934
That was a romantic proposal.

777
00:48:22,968 --> 00:48:25,303
I've already married
once for love,

778
00:48:25,338 --> 00:48:28,073
but the Gods
stole her from me.

779
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:32,311
I come from nothing.

780
00:48:32,345 --> 00:48:35,213
My mother and father
never owned a pair of shoes.

781
00:48:35,247 --> 00:48:38,383
But marry me and I will
give you the Seven Kingdoms

782
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:42,154
and our children will be
Princes and Princesses.

783
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:46,424
See?

784
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:49,094
I have more ambition
than you thought.

785
00:48:50,563 --> 00:48:52,672
The time is right,
Daenerys Targaryen,

786
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:54,697
first of your name.

787
00:48:55,068 --> 00:48:57,537
Robert Baratheon
is dead.

788
00:49:04,378 --> 00:49:06,713
<i>If you cross the sea</i>
<i>with an army you bought--</i>

789
00:49:06,748 --> 00:49:09,016
The Seven Kingdoms are
at war with one another.

790
00:49:09,051 --> 00:49:11,452
Four false kings
destroying the country.

791
00:49:11,487 --> 00:49:14,789
To win Westeros, you need
support from Westeros.

792
00:49:14,824 --> 00:49:16,624
The usurper is dead.

793
00:49:16,659 --> 00:49:18,326
The Starks fight
the Lannisters,

794
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,261
and Baratheons
fight each other.

795
00:49:20,295 --> 00:49:21,829
According to
your new friend

796
00:49:21,863 --> 00:49:23,597
who earned your trust
by cutting his hand?

797
00:49:23,631 --> 00:49:26,500
The time to strike is now. We need
to find ships and an army

798
00:49:26,534 --> 00:49:28,424
or we'll spend the rest
of our lives rotting away

799
00:49:28,449 --> 00:49:29,470
at the edge of the world.

800
00:49:29,471 --> 00:49:31,905
Rich men do not become rich
by giving more than they get.

801
00:49:31,939 --> 00:49:34,674
They'll give you ships and soldiers
and they'll own you forever.

802
00:49:34,709 --> 00:49:38,444
Moving carefully is the hard way,
but it's the right way.

803
00:49:38,479 --> 00:49:39,912
And if I'd listened
to that advice

804
00:49:39,946 --> 00:49:42,148
outside the gates of Qarth,
we'd all be dead by now.

805
00:49:42,182 --> 00:49:45,251
I know the opportunity before you
seems like the last you'll ever have,

806
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:45,992
but you must--

807
00:49:46,017 --> 00:49:48,017
Do not speak to me
like I'm a child.

808
00:49:51,425 --> 00:49:53,793
- I only want--
- What do you want?

809
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:56,395
Tell me.

810
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:57,964
To see you
on the Iron Throne.

811
00:49:57,998 --> 00:50:00,733
- Why?
- You have a good claim.

812
00:50:00,767 --> 00:50:03,569
A title.
A birthright.

813
00:50:03,603 --> 00:50:06,805
But you have something
more than that.

814
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:11,076
You may cover it up and deny it,
but you have a gentle heart.

815
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:13,612
You would not only
be respected and feared,

816
00:50:13,647 --> 00:50:16,148
you would be loved.

817
00:50:16,182 --> 00:50:18,316
Someone who can rule
and should rule.

818
00:50:18,351 --> 00:50:20,440
Centuries come and go
without a person like that

819
00:50:20,465 --> 00:50:22,465
coming into the world.

820
00:50:23,155 --> 00:50:24,722
There are times
when I look at you

821
00:50:24,756 --> 00:50:27,624
and still can't
believe you're real.

822
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:42,939
So what would you
have me do as my advisor?

823
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:50,712
<i>Make your own way.</i>

824
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:53,548
Find your own ship.
You only need one.

825
00:50:53,582 --> 00:50:57,018
The allies we need
are in Westeros, not Qarth.

826
00:50:58,254 --> 00:51:00,722
And how do I get
the ship?

827
00:51:00,756 --> 00:51:03,258
<i>I'll find it for you.</i>

828
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:05,427
A sound ship
with a good captain.

829
00:51:11,035 --> 00:51:13,736
I look forward
to meeting him.

830
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:19,141
Khaleesi.

831
00:51:48,674 --> 00:51:50,810
You should stand
sideface.

832
00:51:50,844 --> 00:51:52,979
Sideface?

833
00:51:53,013 --> 00:51:55,115
Sideways.

834
00:51:55,149 --> 00:51:57,550
- Why?
- Smaller target.

835
00:52:00,754 --> 00:52:02,722
Am I fighting someone?

836
00:52:02,756 --> 00:52:05,124
You're practicing
for a fight.

837
00:52:06,092 --> 00:52:07,760
You should practice right.

838
00:52:11,097 --> 00:52:13,032
Guards!

839
00:52:13,066 --> 00:52:16,068
- Help.
- Did you see anything?

840
00:52:17,904 --> 00:52:21,706
Go up there. Go and see where
he fell from.

841
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:27,411
Go up the back.

842
00:52:27,445 --> 00:52:29,646
<i>That is strange.</i>

843
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:38,253
Move away.

844
00:52:39,889 --> 00:52:43,359
<i>Stand back.</i>
<i>He's dead.</i>

845
