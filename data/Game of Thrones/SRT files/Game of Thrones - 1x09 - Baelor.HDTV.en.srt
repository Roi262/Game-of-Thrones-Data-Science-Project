3
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,499
<i>You've seen</i>
<i>better days, My Lord.</i>

4
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:12,803
Another visit?

5
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:16,572
It seems
you're my last friend.

6
00:02:16,607 --> 00:02:19,375
No no,
many still love you.

7
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:22,677
Sansa came to court
this morning

8
00:02:22,712 --> 00:02:24,846
to plead for your life.

9
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:28,649
On her knees,
begging for me, hmmm.

10
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:30,651
Did you laugh
with the others?

11
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:32,486
You do me wrong, My Lord.

12
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,721
Your blood is
the last thing I want.

13
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,556
I don't know
what you want.

14
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,524
I've given up
trying to guess.

15
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,996
When I was still a boy--

16
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:47,233
before they cut my balls off
with a hot knife--

17
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:51,570
I traveled with a group
of actors through the free cities.

18
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,141
They taught me that
each man has a role to play.

19
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,077
The same is true
at court.

20
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,446
I am the master
of whisperers.

21
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,349
My role is to be sly, obsequious
and without scruples.

22
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:07,785
I'm a good actor,
My Lord.

23
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:11,321
Huh.
Can you free me from this pit?

24
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:13,088
I could.

25
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:14,756
But will I?

26
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,424
No.

27
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,292
As I said,
I'm no hero.

28
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:21,360
What do you want?
Tell me.

29
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:24,361
No riddles, no stories--
tell me, what do you want?

30
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:28,063
Peace.

31
00:03:28,097 --> 00:03:30,898
Did you know that
your son is marching south

32
00:03:30,932 --> 00:03:34,000
with an army of Northmen?
Loyal lad--

33
00:03:34,035 --> 00:03:36,670
fighting for
his father's freedom.

34
00:03:36,704 --> 00:03:38,938
Robb?

35
00:03:38,972 --> 00:03:40,972
He's just a boy.

36
00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:43,441
Boys have been
conquerors before.

37
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:45,776
But the man giving Cersei
sleepless nights

38
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:49,379
is the King's--
the late King's brother.

39
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:52,882
Lord Stannis has the best
claim to the Throne,

40
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:56,118
he is a proven battle commander
and he is utterly without mercy.

41
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,286
Stannis Baratheon
is Robert's true heir.

42
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,588
The Throne
is his by rights.

43
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:05,158
Tsk tsk. Sansa pleaded
so sweetly for your life,

44
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:07,427
it would be a shame
to throw it away.

45
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:10,196
Cersei is no fool.

46
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:14,233
She knows a tame wolf is more
use to her than a dead one.

47
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,035
You want me to serve the
woman who murdered my King,

48
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:19,804
who butchered my men,
who crippled my son?

49
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,907
I want you
to serve the realm!

50
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:24,677
Tell the Queen you will confess
your vile treason,

51
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:26,980
tell your son
to lay down his sword

52
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:30,284
and proclaim Joffrey
as the true heir.

53
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:35,189
Cersei knows you
as a man of honor.

54
00:04:35,223 --> 00:04:37,291
If you give her
the peace she needs

55
00:04:37,326 --> 00:04:40,194
and promise to carry
her secret to your grave,

56
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:44,030
I believe she will allow you to take
the Black and live out your days

57
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:46,498
on the Wall with your brother
and your bastard son.

58
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:50,601
You think my life is
some precious thing to me?

59
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:55,439
That I would trade my honor
for a few more years of...

60
00:04:55,474 --> 00:04:57,241
Of what?

61
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,114
You grew up with actors.

62
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:09,418
You learned their craft
and you learned it well.

63
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:12,053
But I grew up
with soldiers.

64
00:05:13,989 --> 00:05:17,224
I learned how to die
a long time ago.

65
00:05:19,594 --> 00:05:22,028
Pity.

66
00:05:22,063 --> 00:05:24,330
<i>Such a pity.</i>

67
00:05:31,003 --> 00:05:33,438
What of your
daughter's life, My Lord?

68
00:05:33,472 --> 00:05:36,574
<i>Is that a precious</i>
<i>thing to you?</i>

69
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:20,340
It's a birthday message
to his grand-niece Walda.

70
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,476
Or so Walder Frey
would have you think.

71
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,811
Keep shooting them down.
We can't risk Lord Walder

72
00:06:24,845 --> 00:06:27,446
sending word of your movements
to the Lannisters.

73
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:30,482
He's grandfather's bannerman.
We can't expect his support?

74
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:34,451
Expect nothing of Walder Frey
and you'll never be surprised.

75
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:36,587
Look.

76
00:06:37,755 --> 00:06:39,656
<i>Father rots</i>
<i>in a dungeon.</i>

77
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,724
How long before
they take his head?

78
00:06:41,758 --> 00:06:45,060
We need to cross the Trident
and we need to do it now.

79
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:47,495
Just march up to his gates
and tell him you're crossing.

80
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,498
We've got five times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.

81
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:53,901
Not in time. Tywin Lannister
marches north as we speak.

82
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:56,669
The Freys have held
the crossing for 600 years,

83
00:06:56,703 --> 00:07:00,105
and for 600 years they have never
failed to exact their toll.

84
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:01,973
Have my horse
saddled and ready.

85
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:05,710
Enter the Twins alone
and he'll sell you to the Lannis.

86
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:08,578
Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.

87
00:07:11,048 --> 00:07:14,017
My father would do whatever
it took to secure our crossing.

88
00:07:14,052 --> 00:07:16,253
Whatever it took.

89
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:18,188
If I'm going
to lead this army,

90
00:07:18,223 --> 00:07:20,725
I can't have other men
doing my bargaining for me.

91
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,295
I agree.

92
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,864
- I'll go.
- Theon: <i>You can't!</i>

93
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:28,499
I have known Lord Walder
since I was a girl.

94
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:30,167
He would never
harm me.

95
00:07:30,202 --> 00:07:32,836
<i>Unless there was</i>
<i>a profit in it.</i>

96
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:40,342
What do you want?

97
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:44,044
It is a great pleasure to see you
again after so many years, My Lord.

98
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,879
Oh spare me.

99
00:07:45,913 --> 00:07:48,882
Your boy's too proud
to come before me himself.

100
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:52,184
What am I supposed
to do with you?

101
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:55,554
Father, you forget yourself.
Lady Stark is here--

102
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:59,023
Who asked you?
You're not Lord Frey yet,

103
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:01,525
not until I die.
Do I look dead to you?

104
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,470
Father, please--

105
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:05,108
I need lessons in courtesy
from you, bastard?

106
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:07,997
Your mother would still
be a milkmaid

107
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:10,933
if I hadn't squirted you
into her belly.

108
00:08:14,504 --> 00:08:17,672
All right,
you come forward.

109
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,517
There. Now that I've observed
the courtesies,

110
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:35,220
<i>perhaps my sons will do me the honor</i>
<i>of shutting their mouths.</i>

111
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:42,526
Is there somewhere
we can talk?

112
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,462
We're talking
right now.

113
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:50,266
Fine.

114
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,934
Out! All of you!

115
00:09:02,912 --> 00:09:04,779
You too.

116
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:14,154
You see that?

117
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:15,789
15 she is.

118
00:09:15,824 --> 00:09:18,258
A little flower.

119
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:22,795
And her honey's all mine.

120
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,333
I'm sure she will
give you many sons.

121
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:31,103
Huh. Your father didn't
come to the wedding.

122
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,472
He is quite ill, My Lord.

123
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,408
Didn't come to
the last one either.

124
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,911
Or the one before that.

125
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,514
Your family has always
pissed on me.

126
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,349
- My Lord, I--
- Don't deny it. You know it's true.

127
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,752
The fine Lord Tully

128
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:50,053
would never marry any
of his children to mine.

129
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:52,021
I'm sure there
were reasons why--

130
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:54,690
I didn't need reasons.
I needed to get rid

131
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:58,260
of sons and daughters.
You see how they pile up?

132
00:10:01,697 --> 00:10:04,431
Why are you here?

133
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:07,099
To ask you

134
00:10:07,134 --> 00:10:09,434
to open your gates,
My Lord,

135
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:13,949
so my son and his bannermen may cross
the Trident and be on their way.

136
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,183
Why should I let him?

137
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,157
If you could climb
your own battlements,

138
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:21,011
you would see that he has
20,000 men outside your walls.

139
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:24,447
They'll be 20,000 corpses
when Tywin Lannister gets here.

140
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:26,949
Don't try and frighten me,
Lady Stark.

141
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:29,518
Your husband's in a cell
beneath the Red Keep

142
00:10:29,553 --> 00:10:32,454
and your son's got no fur
to keep his balls warm.

143
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:34,923
You swore an oath
to my father.

144
00:10:34,957 --> 00:10:37,225
Oh yes, I said some words...

145
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:41,094
And I swore oaths to the crown too,
if I remember right.

146
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:44,930
Joffrey's King now,
which makes your boy

147
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:48,500
and his corpses-to-be nothing
but rebels, it seems to me.

148
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:52,369
If I had the sense
the Gods gave a fish,

149
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:54,438
I'd hand you both
over to the Lannisters.

150
00:10:54,472 --> 00:10:57,007
- Why don't you?
- Stark, Tully,

151
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,309
Lannister, Baratheon,

152
00:10:59,377 --> 00:11:02,011
give me one good reason

153
00:11:02,046 --> 00:11:05,481
why I should waste
a single thought on any of you?

154
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:08,851
<i>And... engage.

155
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:12,384
When does Aemon think you'll
be able to use that hand?

156
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:15,490
- Soon, he says.
- Good.

157
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:19,494
You'll be ready
for this then.

158
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:22,764
I thought a wolf was
more appropriate for you

159
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:24,866
than a bear...

160
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:28,870
So I had a new pommel made.
It's called Longclaw.

161
00:11:28,904 --> 00:11:32,739
Works as well for a wolf
as a bear, I think.

162
00:11:43,515 --> 00:11:46,250
This is Valyrian steel.

163
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:49,052
It was my father's sword,

164
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:50,954
his father before him.

165
00:11:50,988 --> 00:11:54,590
The Mormonts have carried it
for five centuries.

166
00:11:54,624 --> 00:11:56,692
It was meant
for my son Jorah.

167
00:11:56,726 --> 00:11:59,461
He brought dishonor
to our House,

168
00:11:59,495 --> 00:12:01,997
but he had the grace
to leave the sword

169
00:12:02,031 --> 00:12:04,800
before he fled
from Westeros.

170
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:07,169
My Lord, you honor me,
but I can't--

171
00:12:07,203 --> 00:12:09,770
Oh, you can
and you will.

172
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:14,140
I wouldn't be standing here if it
wasn't for you and your beast.

173
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:18,444
A bloody dead man
tried to kill me...

174
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,281
So you'll take it.
I'll hear no more about it.

175
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:26,050
- Is that understood?
- Yes, My Lord.

176
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:29,152
Right.
Now don't think this means

177
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:31,488
I approve
of this nonsense

178
00:12:31,523 --> 00:12:33,590
with you
and Alliser Thorne.

179
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:36,158
That's a man's sword,

180
00:12:36,193 --> 00:12:38,861
it'll take
a man to wield it.

181
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:40,897
I'll apologize
to Ser Alliser tonight.

182
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:42,365
No you won't!

183
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,467
I sent him to King's Landing
yesterday.

184
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:46,703
The hand that your wolf

185
00:12:46,737 --> 00:12:48,304
tore off
that thing's wrist--

186
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:52,041
I've ordered Thorne to lay it
at the feet of this...

187
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,909
Boy King.

188
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:56,778
That should get young
Joffrey's attention.

189
00:12:56,812 --> 00:13:00,313
And it puts
a thousand leagues

190
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:03,115
between you and Thorne.

191
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,651
Now go and put your sword
somewhere safe

192
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,286
and bring me
my supper.

193
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,787
Yes, My Lord.

194
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:23,899
- Well done.
- Well done.

195
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:27,670
You earned that, Snow.

196
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,673
Well done.

197
00:13:38,076 --> 00:13:39,409
Go on,
let's have a look.

198
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,845
- At what?
- Grenn: The sword! Show us the sword.

199
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:45,082
Sword! Sword!
Sword! Sword!

200
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:55,159
- Let's have a look.
- Piss off.

201
00:13:55,194 --> 00:13:58,195
Get off of it.
Piss off.

202
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,664
Come on, I want to have
a look at it in the light.

203
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:06,237
Give it here!

204
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:08,139
What is it?

205
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:10,241
- I--
- Look at its eyes.

206
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:11,809
- Give it.
- I can't.

207
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:14,612
You can't what?

208
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:19,182
I-- I'm really not
supposed to say.

209
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:22,685
And yet you really
want to say.

210
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,454
You want to say
that...?

211
00:14:28,124 --> 00:14:30,726
There was a raven.

212
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,128
I read the message
to Maester Aemon.

213
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,931
It's your brother Robb.

214
00:14:36,965 --> 00:14:39,099
What?

215
00:14:39,134 --> 00:14:40,934
What about him?

216
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:43,903
He's heading south.

217
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:45,805
To war.

218
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:51,143
All his bannermen have rallied
to his side. They'll keep him safe.

219
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:55,313
I should be there.

220
00:14:57,115 --> 00:14:59,650
I should be with him.

221
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,996
...If we do that, they'll never
get back across.

222
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:19,566
Well?

223
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,101
What did he say?

224
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:25,003
Lord Walder has granted
your crossing.

225
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:29,974
- His men are yours as well--
- Greatjon: Huh.

226
00:15:30,008 --> 00:15:32,209
--Less the 400 he will keep here
to hold the crossing

227
00:15:32,244 --> 00:15:33,945
against any who would
pursue you.

228
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:35,380
And what does
he want in return?

229
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:39,016
You will be taking on his son
Olyvar as your personal squire.

230
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,753
- He expects a knighthood in good time.
- Fine fine.

231
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:46,189
And?

232
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:49,225
And Arya

233
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,427
will marry his son Waldron

234
00:15:51,461 --> 00:15:54,530
- <i>when they both come of age.</i>
- She won't be happy about that.

235
00:15:54,564 --> 00:15:56,298
Hmmm.

236
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:00,669
And?

237
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,406
And

238
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:07,476
when the fighting
is done...

239
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:11,380
You will marry
one of his daughters.

240
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:14,350
<i>Whichever you prefer.</i>

241
00:16:14,384 --> 00:16:17,887
He has a number he thinks
will be... suitable.

242
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:19,989
I see.

243
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:24,126
Did you get a look at his daughters?

244
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,927
<i>I did.</i>

245
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:28,195
And?

246
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:31,398
One was...

247
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:38,671
Do you consent?

248
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,640
Can I refuse?

249
00:16:40,674 --> 00:16:42,841
Not if you want to cross.

250
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:48,313
Then I consent.

251
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,454
Sam said you wanted
to see me?

252
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,356
I did indeed.

253
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,055
Perhaps you would be
kind enough to assist me.

254
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:46,793
Tell me,
did you ever wonder

255
00:17:46,827 --> 00:17:49,695
why the men
of The Night's Watch

256
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:52,597
take no wives
and father no children?

257
00:17:52,632 --> 00:17:54,732
No.

258
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:57,201
So they will not love.

259
00:17:57,235 --> 00:18:00,770
<i>Love is the death</i>
<i>of duty.</i>

260
00:18:00,805 --> 00:18:04,774
If the day should ever come when
your lord father was forced to choose

261
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:07,409
between honor
on the one hand

262
00:18:07,444 --> 00:18:10,078
and those he loves
on the other,

263
00:18:10,113 --> 00:18:12,147
what would he do?

264
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:16,550
He would do whatever was right.
No matter what.

265
00:18:16,585 --> 00:18:21,355
Then Lord Stark
is one man in 10,000.

266
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:24,524
Most of us are not
so strong.

267
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:26,392
What is honor

268
00:18:26,426 --> 00:18:29,028
compared
to a woman's love?

269
00:18:29,062 --> 00:18:31,630
<i>And what is duty</i>

270
00:18:31,664 --> 00:18:35,200
<i>against the feel of a newborn son</i>
<i>in your arms?</i>

271
00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:38,903
Or a brother's smile?

272
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,640
Sam told you.

273
00:18:43,675 --> 00:18:45,575
We're all human.

274
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:49,177
Oh, we all do our duty when
there's no cost to it.

275
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:52,013
Honor comes easy then.

276
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,983
Yet sooner or later

277
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:57,885
in every man's life

278
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,788
there comes a day
when it is not easy,

279
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:04,090
a day when
he must choose.

280
00:19:05,926 --> 00:19:07,893
And this is my day?

281
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:10,028
Is that what
you're saying?

282
00:19:10,063 --> 00:19:13,198
Oh, it hurts, boy.
Oh yes.

283
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:16,300
- I know.
- You do not know!

284
00:19:17,936 --> 00:19:20,104
No one knows.

285
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,007
I may be a bastard,

286
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:26,510
but he is my father
and Robb is my brother.

287
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:34,652
The Gods were cruel when they
saw fit to test my vows.

288
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:37,156
They waited till I was old.

289
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:42,295
What could I do when the ravens
brought the news from the South--

290
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:45,230
the ruin of my House,
the death of my family?

291
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:47,899
I was helpless,

292
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:50,734
blind, frail.

293
00:19:52,336 --> 00:19:55,438
But when I heard

294
00:19:55,472 --> 00:19:58,073
they had killed
my brother's son,

295
00:19:58,107 --> 00:20:00,175
and his poor son...

296
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:01,642
And the children!

297
00:20:01,677 --> 00:20:04,879
Even the little children.

298
00:20:05,814 --> 00:20:07,981
Who are you?

299
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:13,853
My father was Maekar,

300
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:16,221
the first of his name.

301
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:20,458
My brother Aegon
reigned after him

302
00:20:20,492 --> 00:20:23,460
when I had refused
the Throne.

303
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:27,064
And he was followed
by his son Aerys,

304
00:20:27,098 --> 00:20:29,766
whom they called
the Mad King.

305
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,102
You're Aemon Targaryen.

306
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:36,071
I'm a Maester
of the Citadel,

307
00:20:36,106 --> 00:20:41,643
bound in service to Castle Black
and The Night's Watch.

308
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,915
I will not tell you
to stay or go.

309
00:20:47,949 --> 00:20:51,418
You must make
that choice yourself,

310
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:55,454
and live with it
for the rest of your days.

311
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,891
As I have.

312
00:21:25,613 --> 00:21:27,513
Drogo.

313
00:21:36,053 --> 00:21:38,790
<i>Sajo anni.</i>

314
00:22:32,608 --> 00:22:34,309
Hyah hyah.

315
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,727
<i>Our scouts tell us</i>

316
00:22:55,762 --> 00:22:58,430
<i>the Stark host has moved</i>
<i>south from the Twins</i>

317
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:01,165
with Lord Frey's levies
in tow.

318
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:03,300
They're a day's
march north.

319
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:06,003
The boy may lack
experience and sense,

320
00:23:06,037 --> 00:23:09,106
<i>but he does have</i>
<i>a certain mindless</i>

321
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,442
- provincial courage.
- Ah.

322
00:23:15,912 --> 00:23:18,179
Oh, do continue.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

323
00:23:18,214 --> 00:23:20,715
I do hope your savages
are going to be of some use,

324
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:22,717
otherwise we've wasted
good steel on them.

325
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:26,153
The great hairy one insisted he
must have two battle axes--

326
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:28,722
heavy black steel,
double-sided.

327
00:23:28,756 --> 00:23:30,690
Shagga likes axes.

328
00:23:30,724 --> 00:23:33,325
When the battle commences,
you and your wildlings

329
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,560
<i>will be in the vanguard.</i>

330
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:37,028
- The vanguard?
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

331
00:23:37,062 --> 00:23:38,929
Me and the tribesmen
on the front lines?

332
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:42,467
<i>They do seem</i>
<i>rather ferocious.</i>

333
00:23:44,637 --> 00:23:47,840
Ferocious?
Last night

334
00:23:47,874 --> 00:23:51,510
a Moon brother stabbed
a Stone Crow over a sausage.

335
00:23:51,545 --> 00:23:55,415
<i>Three Stone Crows seized the Moon</i>
<i>brother and opened his throat.</i>

336
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:58,418
Bronn managed to keep Shagga from
chopping off the dead man's cock,

337
00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:00,654
which was fortunate,
but even still

338
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:02,489
Ulf is demanding
blood money,

339
00:24:02,523 --> 00:24:05,125
which Shagga and Gunthor
refuse to pay.

340
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,261
When soldiers lack discipline,
the fault lies with their commander.

341
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:09,829
Surely there are ways
to have me killed

342
00:24:09,864 --> 00:24:11,899
that would be less detrimental
to the war effort.

343
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:14,635
There'll be no more
discussion on the matter.

344
00:24:18,873 --> 00:24:22,075
It appears I'm not
hungry after all.

345
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:23,977
Excuse me, My Lords.

346
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:39,657
Where did you find one
so pretty at this hour?

347
00:24:39,691 --> 00:24:42,426
- I took her.
- Took her?

348
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,495
- From whom?
- From, uh...

349
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:47,396
Ser-- what's his name?

350
00:24:47,431 --> 00:24:50,132
I don't know.
Ginger cunt three tents down.

351
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:53,369
<i>And he didn't have anything</i>
<i>to say about it?</i>

352
00:24:53,403 --> 00:24:56,905
He said something.

353
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:01,975
Well, the odds of me
living long enough

354
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,611
for him to retaliate
just dropped drastically.

355
00:25:04,645 --> 00:25:07,046
We'll be at
the vanguard tomorrow.

356
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,916
Oh well.

357
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:17,221
I... think I'll go
and find myself one.

358
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,191
Who are you?

359
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:24,526
Who would you like me to be?

360
00:25:24,527 --> 00:25:26,962
What did your mother
call you?

361
00:25:26,996 --> 00:25:28,748
Shae.

362
00:25:28,773 --> 00:25:30,509
What did your
mother call you?

363
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,102
My mother died
giving birth to me.

364
00:25:33,136 --> 00:25:36,672
Is that why I'm here?
So we can talk about our mothers?

365
00:25:36,707 --> 00:25:40,208
- What sort of accent is that?
- Foreign.

366
00:25:40,276 --> 00:25:42,076
For--

367
00:25:43,478 --> 00:25:45,212
What do you want
from me?

368
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:47,981
What do I want from you?

369
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:51,351
I want you to share my tent.

370
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:54,420
I want you to pour my wine,
laugh at my jokes,

371
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:57,257
rub my legs when they're
sore after a day's ride.

372
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:59,559
I want you to take
no other man to bed

373
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:01,560
for as long
as we're together.

374
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:05,764
And I want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world--

375
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:08,067
which it may well be.

376
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:09,703
And what do I get?

377
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:12,973
Safety.

378
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:15,743
No one will hurt you
for as long as you're mine.

379
00:26:16,812 --> 00:26:19,145
The pleasure
of my company,

380
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,147
which I have heard
is spectacular.

381
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:24,516
Who told you this?
Women you paid?

382
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,652
And three: More gold

383
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:31,154
<i>than you can spend if you</i>
<i>lived a thousand years.</i>

384
00:26:31,188 --> 00:26:34,290
Do you accept my proposal?

385
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:55,840
Let's start with your last night
in this world.

386
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,560
Doth-- Dothrae...

387
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:21,026
Ki ha-- hammi...

388
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:24,762
Ish nokitta...

389
00:27:24,797 --> 00:27:26,764
Qana'th...

390
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,134
<i>Khaleesi.</i>

391
00:27:30,168 --> 00:27:31,568
Come.

392
00:27:33,938 --> 00:27:35,972
He's very strong.

393
00:27:36,006 --> 00:27:39,141
No one understands
how strong he is.

394
00:27:57,424 --> 00:28:01,026
- He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
- He can't.

395
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,762
He can't.
I won't let him.

396
00:28:03,796 --> 00:28:07,031
Even a Queen doesn't
have that power.

397
00:28:09,701 --> 00:28:12,936
We must go quickly. I've heard
there's a good port in Asshai--

398
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:17,173
- I won't leave him.
- He's already gone, Khaleesi.

399
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:19,241
Doth--

400
00:28:19,276 --> 00:28:21,176
Even if--

401
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:24,279
--Even if he dies,

402
00:28:24,314 --> 00:28:27,116
why would <i>I</i> run?

403
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,351
<i>I am Khaleesi</i>

404
00:28:29,385 --> 00:28:32,988
and my-- my son will be
Khal after Drogo.

405
00:28:33,022 --> 00:28:36,091
This isn't Westeros
where men honor blood.

406
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:39,127
Here they only honor strength.
There will be fighting

407
00:28:39,161 --> 00:28:40,962
<i>after Drogo dies.</i>

408
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:43,632
Whoever wins that fight
will be the new Khal.

409
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:45,867
He won't want any rivals.

410
00:28:45,902 --> 00:28:48,503
Your boy will be plucked
from your breast

411
00:28:48,537 --> 00:28:50,705
<i>and given to the dogs.</i>

412
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,442
I won't leave him.

413
00:29:03,953 --> 00:29:06,921
The wound
has festered.

414
00:30:06,944 --> 00:30:09,812
I think you should wear
your armor tonight, Ser.

415
00:30:09,846 --> 00:30:12,447
I think you're right.

416
00:30:16,985 --> 00:30:18,653
You've saved me
once more.

417
00:30:18,687 --> 00:30:21,322
And now you <i>must</i>
save him.

418
00:30:21,357 --> 00:30:23,725
He's beyond
the healer's skills.

419
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,460
All I can do is
ease his path.

420
00:30:26,494 --> 00:30:28,628
Save him and I will free you.
I swear it.

421
00:30:29,865 --> 00:30:31,932
You must know a way...

422
00:30:31,966 --> 00:30:33,800
Some...

423
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:35,701
Some magic.

424
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:40,205
There is a spell.

425
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:42,473
Some would say death
is cleaner.

426
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:55,019
Do it.

427
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,120
Save him.

428
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,954
There is a price.

429
00:30:58,979 --> 00:31:00,493
You'll have gold--
whatever you want.

430
00:31:00,557 --> 00:31:02,991
It's not a matter of gold.
This is Bloodmagic.

431
00:31:03,026 --> 00:31:05,293
Only death pays for life.

432
00:31:08,463 --> 00:31:10,196
My death?

433
00:31:10,231 --> 00:31:13,232
No.
Not your death, Khaleesi.

434
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:16,402
Bring me his horse.

435
00:31:39,828 --> 00:31:41,462
Khaleesi,
do not do this thing.

436
00:31:41,496 --> 00:31:45,265
- <i>Let me kill this witch.</i>
- Kill her and you kill your Khal.

437
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:48,101
This is Bloodmagic.
It is forbidden.

438
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:51,904
I am your Khaleesi.
I tell you what is forbidden.

439
00:32:02,182 --> 00:32:03,616
Go now!

440
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,852
- Take her and leave.
- Huh-uh.

441
00:32:05,886 --> 00:32:08,054
Take her!

442
00:32:10,357 --> 00:32:11,491
Irriya?

443
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:14,327
You must go also, lady.

444
00:32:14,361 --> 00:32:16,662
<i>Once I begin to sing,</i>
<i>no one must enter the tent.</i>

445
00:32:16,697 --> 00:32:19,465
The dead will
dance here tonight.

446
00:32:32,045 --> 00:32:34,547
No one will enter.

447
00:32:42,656 --> 00:32:45,091
Bring him back to me.

448
00:33:01,575 --> 00:33:03,476
What have you done?

449
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,811
I have to save him.

450
00:33:05,846 --> 00:33:08,981
We could have been 10 miles away from
here by now on the way to Asshai.

451
00:33:09,016 --> 00:33:11,217
You would have been safe.

452
00:33:17,357 --> 00:33:19,625
<i>Jíni'th vos eo.</i>

453
00:33:23,864 --> 00:33:25,431
Mra qothoon vosaan--

454
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:29,835
Khaleesi!

455
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,444
Are you hurt?

456
00:34:15,478 --> 00:34:16,945
- The baby...
- Hmm?

457
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,614
...Is coming.

458
00:34:18,648 --> 00:34:21,183
- Fetch the midwives.
- They will not come.

459
00:34:21,218 --> 00:34:23,219
They say
she is cursed.

460
00:34:23,253 --> 00:34:25,789
They'll come or I'll
have their heads.

461
00:34:27,058 --> 00:34:29,559
The witch--
she can bring baby.

462
00:34:29,594 --> 00:34:32,130
I hear her say so.

463
00:34:54,345 --> 00:34:56,078
Are you in agony,
my lion?

464
00:34:56,112 --> 00:34:58,680
- No.
- You look like you're in agony.

465
00:34:58,715 --> 00:35:02,083
The fire is burning
your pretty soft skin.

466
00:35:05,286 --> 00:35:07,354
Ahhh.

467
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,791
Damn you, woman.
Are you immune to pain?

468
00:35:11,825 --> 00:35:14,026
- Just used to it.
- Drink.

469
00:35:16,062 --> 00:35:18,797
Let's play a new game.

470
00:35:18,831 --> 00:35:21,932
There's a Braavosi knife game
I could teach you--

471
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:24,768
Does it involve the potential
for losing fingers?

472
00:35:24,803 --> 00:35:27,770
- Not if you win.
- No!

473
00:35:27,804 --> 00:35:30,305
No more fire games,
no knife games.

474
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:33,241
Let's do something
I'm good at.

475
00:35:33,275 --> 00:35:35,476
What are you good at?

476
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,477
I happen to be a great
judge of character.

477
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:39,912
- This sounds like a boring game.
- <i>It's not.</i>

478
00:35:39,946 --> 00:35:42,715
<i>Here's how it works:</i>
<i>I make a statement</i>

479
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:45,184
about your past.
If I'm right,

480
00:35:45,218 --> 00:35:47,452
you drink.
If I'm wrong, I drink.

481
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:50,187
And no lying.
I'll know if you're lying.

482
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:52,289
I don't want to play
this game.

483
00:35:52,323 --> 00:35:54,524
Fine.
Bronn first.

484
00:35:58,429 --> 00:36:00,863
Your father beat you.

485
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:08,468
But my mother
hit harder.

486
00:36:11,205 --> 00:36:14,407
You killed your first man
before you were 12.

487
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:16,342
It was a woman.

488
00:36:18,812 --> 00:36:20,979
She swung
an axe at me.

489
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:24,315
You've been
North of the Wall.

490
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,453
What brought you
up there?

491
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:31,756
Work.

492
00:36:31,824 --> 00:36:33,825
And...

493
00:36:33,826 --> 00:36:35,894
You once loved a woman
many years ago,

494
00:36:35,928 --> 00:36:39,197
but it turned out badly so you've
never let yourself love again.

495
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:43,434
Oh wait, that's me.

496
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:49,506
Your turn, my mysterious
foreign beauty.

497
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,375
I don't want to play.

498
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:55,279
It's fun!
Look at the fun we're having.

499
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,950
Your mother
was a whore.

500
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,787
Drink.

501
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,227
All right.

502
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,997
Your father left the family when
you were very young,

503
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:16,032
- never to return.
- Drink.

504
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,991
And we've established
the rules about lying?

505
00:37:19,016 --> 00:37:20,216
Drink!

506
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,142
Mmmm.

507
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:29,378
You wanted
a different life.

508
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,547
You came from somewhere
and you wanted to be elsewhere.

509
00:37:32,582 --> 00:37:35,150
The whole shit-stained world
could drink off that one.

510
00:37:35,184 --> 00:37:37,452
So specifics--

511
00:37:37,486 --> 00:37:40,689
you wanted to be elsewhere,
but how would you get there?

512
00:37:40,723 --> 00:37:44,393
I don't believe the life
of the silent sisters is for you.

513
00:37:44,427 --> 00:37:48,697
So what's
a lowborn girl to do?

514
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:54,302
Drink.

515
00:37:56,038 --> 00:37:59,007
- Are you sure--
- drink!

516
00:38:03,546 --> 00:38:07,216
And don't talk about
my mother and father ever

517
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:10,688
or I will carve your eyes
from your head.

518
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:17,260
My dear lady, if I have
offended you, I apologize.

519
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:19,461
My turn.

520
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:21,897
Fine fine.

521
00:38:21,931 --> 00:38:24,232
Ask away.

522
00:38:24,266 --> 00:38:27,335
Try to penetrate
the enigma that is me.

523
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:30,137
- Who were you in love with?
- That's not how the game works.

524
00:38:30,171 --> 00:38:32,505
I don't care the way
the game works.

525
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,641
Our Lord here
used to be married.

526
00:38:35,743 --> 00:38:37,744
- Married?
- How did you hear that?

527
00:38:37,778 --> 00:38:41,315
You hear lots of things playing
dice with Lannister soldiers.

528
00:38:43,752 --> 00:38:45,053
Another night,
perhaps.

529
00:38:45,087 --> 00:38:48,390
Not another night.
This night.

530
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,561
It's not
a pleasant story.

531
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,736
- Or maybe I will cry.
- I'm guessing the lady and I

532
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:59,506
can tell more unpleasant stories
than your Lordship.

533
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,173
So...

534
00:39:07,377 --> 00:39:10,980
I was 16. My brother Jaime
and I were riding

535
00:39:11,014 --> 00:39:14,716
when we heard a scream.
She ran out onto the road,

536
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,417
clothes half torn off
with two men on her heels.

537
00:39:17,452 --> 00:39:21,987
Jaime scared away the men easily
enough, while I wrapped her in my cloak.

538
00:39:22,021 --> 00:39:24,076
She was too scared to send off
on her own,

539
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:25,948
so while Jaime
hunted down the rapers

540
00:39:25,992 --> 00:39:29,127
I took her to the nearest
inn and fed her.

541
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:31,929
Her name was Tysha.

542
00:39:31,963 --> 00:39:34,198
She was
a wheelwright's orphan.

543
00:39:34,232 --> 00:39:36,366
And she was hungry--

544
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:39,803
together we finished off
three chickens and a flagon of wine.

545
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:43,238
Impossible as it seems, there was a
time when I was unaccustomed to wine.

546
00:39:43,273 --> 00:39:46,107
I forgot how afraid
I was around girls,

547
00:39:46,142 --> 00:39:49,545
how I was always waiting
for them to laugh at me

548
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:52,013
or look away embarrassed

549
00:39:52,048 --> 00:39:54,448
or ask me about my tall
handsome brother.

550
00:39:54,483 --> 00:39:57,585
I forgot about
everything but Tysha.

551
00:39:58,853 --> 00:40:01,221
And somehow I found
myself in her bed.

552
00:40:01,255 --> 00:40:03,690
For three chickens,
I should hope so.

553
00:40:03,725 --> 00:40:07,594
It didn't last long. I didn't know
what the hell I was doing.

554
00:40:07,629 --> 00:40:10,230
But she was good to me.

555
00:40:10,265 --> 00:40:12,366
She kissed me afterwards

556
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,302
and sang me a song.

557
00:40:15,336 --> 00:40:20,441
And by morning I was deep enough
in love to ask for her hand.

558
00:40:20,475 --> 00:40:23,177
A few lies, a few gold coins,
one drunken Septon

559
00:40:23,211 --> 00:40:25,613
and there you have it--
man and wife.

560
00:40:25,647 --> 00:40:29,250
For a fortnight anyway,
until the Septon sobered up

561
00:40:29,284 --> 00:40:31,318
and told my father.

562
00:40:31,353 --> 00:40:34,321
I imagine that was
the end of all that.

563
00:40:34,355 --> 00:40:36,389
Not quite.

564
00:40:36,424 --> 00:40:40,027
First, my father had
Jaime tell me the truth.

565
00:40:41,229 --> 00:40:44,164
The girl was a whore,
you see.

566
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,668
Jaime had arranged
the whole thing,

567
00:40:47,702 --> 00:40:50,537
the road, the rapers--
all of it.

568
00:40:50,572 --> 00:40:53,173
He thought it was time
I had a woman.

569
00:40:55,143 --> 00:40:57,311
<i>After my brother confessed,</i>

570
00:40:57,345 --> 00:41:00,647
my father brought in my wife

571
00:41:00,682 --> 00:41:03,450
and gave her
to his guards.

572
00:41:03,484 --> 00:41:07,020
<i>He paid her well--</i>
<i>a silver for each man.</i>

573
00:41:07,054 --> 00:41:10,023
How many whores command
that kind of price?

574
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:14,995
He brought me into the barracks
and made me watch.

575
00:41:15,029 --> 00:41:18,431
By the end,
she had so much silver

576
00:41:18,465 --> 00:41:21,400
that the coins were
slipping through her fingers

577
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:24,236
and rolling
onto the floor.

578
00:41:26,974 --> 00:41:29,976
I would have killed the man
who did that to me.

579
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:33,246
You should have known
she was a whore.

580
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,581
Really?

581
00:41:35,615 --> 00:41:38,451
I was 16, drunk
and in love--

582
00:41:38,485 --> 00:41:40,386
A girl who
was almost raped

583
00:41:40,421 --> 00:41:43,389
doesn't invite another man
into her bed two hours later.

584
00:41:44,991 --> 00:41:49,294
As I said, I was
young and stupid.

585
00:41:51,497 --> 00:41:53,932
You are still
young and stupid.

586
00:42:17,255 --> 00:42:19,456
Hyah!

587
00:42:35,673 --> 00:42:37,307
What is it?
What do you want?

588
00:42:37,341 --> 00:42:39,176
You're sleeping
through the war.

589
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:42,112
- What?
- They stole a night's march on us.

590
00:42:42,146 --> 00:42:44,380
They're a mile north.

591
00:42:44,415 --> 00:42:47,016
- <i>Get my squire!</i>
- You don't have a squire.

592
00:42:49,386 --> 00:42:51,720
If I die, weep for me.

593
00:42:52,955 --> 00:42:56,057
You'll be dead.
How will you know?

594
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:04,068
I'll know.

595
00:43:05,904 --> 00:43:07,771
Watch out!
Move!

596
00:43:08,807 --> 00:43:10,374
Out of the way!

597
00:43:10,408 --> 00:43:12,777
- Move aside!
- ( Neighs

598
00:43:18,919 --> 00:43:20,786
stay low.

599
00:43:20,821 --> 00:43:22,922
Stay low?

600
00:43:22,956 --> 00:43:25,524
If you're lucky,
no one will notice you.

601
00:43:25,558 --> 00:43:28,094
I was born lucky.

602
00:43:30,797 --> 00:43:32,999
Tribesmen of the Vale,

603
00:43:33,033 --> 00:43:35,869
gather round!

604
00:43:35,903 --> 00:43:38,405
Stone Crows!

605
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,707
Black Ears!
Burned Men!

606
00:43:40,741 --> 00:43:43,477
- Moon brothers!
- Man: <i>And painted dogs!</i>

607
00:43:43,511 --> 00:43:45,879
And painted dogs!

608
00:43:45,913 --> 00:43:49,382
Your dominion over
the Vale begins now!

609
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:52,285
Onward to claim
what is yours!

610
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,754
Half man! Half man!

611
00:43:54,788 --> 00:43:57,723
Half man!
Half man!

612
00:43:57,757 --> 00:44:00,959
Half man! Half man!

613
00:44:00,993 --> 00:44:02,927
To battle.

614
00:44:45,165 --> 00:44:47,500
<i>You're a shit warrior.</i>

615
00:44:49,536 --> 00:44:51,503
I'm alive?

616
00:44:51,538 --> 00:44:54,872
You're alive.

617
00:44:59,478 --> 00:45:01,278
Did we win?

618
00:45:01,313 --> 00:45:03,914
We wouldn't be having
this conversation if we didn't.

619
00:45:16,793 --> 00:45:19,595
How did our
tribesmen do?

620
00:45:20,731 --> 00:45:22,932
Yeah, good.

621
00:45:22,967 --> 00:45:26,102
<i>It's nice to see them</i>
<i>getting along.</i>

622
00:45:26,136 --> 00:45:28,204
<i>You're wounded.</i>

623
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:31,439
Good of you to notice.

624
00:45:31,473 --> 00:45:33,574
I hear we won.

625
00:45:33,608 --> 00:45:36,243
Hmph.
The scouts were wrong.

626
00:45:36,277 --> 00:45:40,313
There were 2,000
Stark bannermen, not 20,000.

627
00:45:41,448 --> 00:45:43,483
Did we get the Stark boy,
at least?

628
00:45:43,517 --> 00:45:45,551
He wasn't here.

629
00:45:45,586 --> 00:45:47,420
Where was he?

630
00:45:47,454 --> 00:45:50,122
With his other 18,000 men.

631
00:45:53,025 --> 00:45:55,493
And where are they?

632
00:46:05,602 --> 00:46:07,938
- We should go, My Lady.
- No!

633
00:46:12,775 --> 00:46:15,410
My Lady!

634
00:46:16,612 --> 00:46:19,146
Hyah hyah!

635
00:46:50,439 --> 00:46:54,175
By the time they knew what was
happening, it had already happened.

636
00:46:57,412 --> 00:46:59,613
Lady Stark.
I'd offer you my sword,

637
00:46:59,648 --> 00:47:01,648
but I seem
to have lost it.

638
00:47:01,682 --> 00:47:04,216
It's not your sword I want.

639
00:47:04,251 --> 00:47:06,885
Give me my daughters back.

640
00:47:06,952 --> 00:47:09,020
Give me my husband.

641
00:47:09,054 --> 00:47:11,255
I've lost them too,
I'm afraid.

642
00:47:11,289 --> 00:47:13,857
<i>Kill him, Robb.</i>
<i>Send his head to his father.</i>

643
00:47:13,891 --> 00:47:16,059
He cut down 10 of our men--
you saw him.

644
00:47:16,093 --> 00:47:18,995
He's more use
to us alive than dead.

645
00:47:19,029 --> 00:47:22,097
Take him away
and put him in irons.

646
00:47:22,132 --> 00:47:24,900
We could end this war
right now, boy,

647
00:47:24,934 --> 00:47:26,968
save thousands of lives.

648
00:47:27,003 --> 00:47:29,871
You fight for the Starks,
I fight for the Lannisters.

649
00:47:29,906 --> 00:47:33,173
Swords or lances, teeth, nails--
choose your weapons

650
00:47:33,207 --> 00:47:35,775
and let's end this
here and now.

651
00:47:37,977 --> 00:47:40,645
If we do it your way,
Kingslayer,

652
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,380
you'd win.

653
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:47,751
We're not doing it
your way.

654
00:47:49,687 --> 00:47:51,787
Come on, pretty man.

655
00:48:00,163 --> 00:48:02,965
I sent 2,000 men
to their graves today.

656
00:48:02,999 --> 00:48:05,534
The bards will sing songs
of their sacrifice.

657
00:48:05,568 --> 00:48:08,804
Aye. But the dead
won't hear them.

658
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:18,346
One victory does not
make us conquerors.

659
00:48:20,282 --> 00:48:22,917
Did we free my father?

660
00:48:22,951 --> 00:48:25,853
Did we rescue my sisters
from the Queen?

661
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:31,026
Did we free the North from those
who want us on our knees?

662
00:48:35,731 --> 00:48:38,798
This war is far from over.

663
00:49:08,928 --> 00:49:10,895
Could I have one?

664
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:13,531
A lemon one--
or any of them.

665
00:49:13,565 --> 00:49:15,099
Three coppers.

666
00:49:16,168 --> 00:49:17,701
How about
a nice fat pigeon?

667
00:49:17,736 --> 00:49:19,636
Piss off now.
Go on.

668
00:49:19,671 --> 00:49:22,539
Do you have any stale ones
from yesterday?

669
00:49:22,574 --> 00:49:24,708
- Or any burnt ones?
- Piss off!

670
00:49:32,151 --> 00:49:34,519
Hey, where's everyone going?
What's happening?

671
00:49:34,553 --> 00:49:36,003
They're taking him
to the Sept of Baelor.

672
00:49:36,004 --> 00:49:36,897
Who?

673
00:49:36,898 --> 00:49:38,832
The Hand of the King.

674
00:50:46,393 --> 00:50:48,625
- Traitor!
- Coward!

675
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:50,527
Baelor.

676
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:52,194
Baelor!

677
00:50:57,867 --> 00:51:00,502
Traitor!
Traitor!

678
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:22,554
I am Eddard Stark,

679
00:51:22,588 --> 00:51:24,988
Lord of Winterfell

680
00:51:25,023 --> 00:51:27,190
and Hand of the King.

681
00:51:36,032 --> 00:51:38,533
I come before you
to confess my treason

682
00:51:38,567 --> 00:51:41,969
<i>in the sight of Gods</i>
<i>and men.</i>

683
00:51:43,338 --> 00:51:45,406
<i>I betrayed the faith</i>
<i>of my King</i>

684
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,809
and the trust
of my friend Robert.

685
00:51:50,078 --> 00:51:53,213
I swore to protect
and defend his children,

686
00:51:53,247 --> 00:51:55,615
but before his blood
was cold

687
00:51:55,649 --> 00:51:58,150
<i>I plotted</i>
<i>to murder his son...</i>

688
00:51:59,585 --> 00:52:01,920
And seize the Throne
for myself.

689
00:52:01,954 --> 00:52:04,589
Traitor!

690
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:14,897
Let the high Septon

691
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:18,534
and Baelor the blessed
bear witness to what I say:

692
00:52:21,038 --> 00:52:23,573
Joffrey Baratheon

693
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:26,442
is the one true heir
to the Iron Throne,

694
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:30,112
<i>by the Grace</i>
<i>of all the gods,</i>

695
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:32,681
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

696
00:52:32,715 --> 00:52:34,983
and Protector
of the Realm.

697
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:44,627
As we sin,

698
00:52:44,695 --> 00:52:46,596
so do we suffer.

699
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:49,499
This man has
confessed his crimes

700
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:52,202
in sight
of Gods and men.

701
00:52:52,236 --> 00:52:55,738
The Gods are just

702
00:52:55,773 --> 00:52:58,608
but beloved Baelor
taught us

703
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:02,444
they can also be
merciful.

704
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,849
What is to be done

705
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:09,351
with this traitor,
Your Grace?

706
00:53:14,258 --> 00:53:17,360
My mother wishes me to let
Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch.

707
00:53:17,395 --> 00:53:20,063
Stripped of all titles
and powers,

708
00:53:20,097 --> 00:53:22,733
he would serve the realm
in permanent exile.

709
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:24,468
And My Lady Sansa

710
00:53:24,502 --> 00:53:27,971
<i>has begged mercy</i>
<i>for her father.</i>

711
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:34,644
But they have
the soft hearts of women.

712
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:37,213
So long as I am your King,

713
00:53:37,248 --> 00:53:41,151
<i>treason shall never</i>
<i>go unpunished.</i>

714
00:53:41,185 --> 00:53:43,252
Ser Ilyn,

715
00:53:43,287 --> 00:53:44,887
bring me his head!

716
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:47,089
No! Stop!

717
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:49,225
Daddy!
Someone stop him!

718
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,405
My son, this is madness.

719
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,175
<i>Put him down!</i>

720
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:13,583
- Don't look!
- Let me go.

721
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:16,586
- Let me go!
- Shut your mouth. Look at me.

722
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:19,389
- Look at me!
- Stop! Daddy!

723
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,491
- Stop! No no!
- Crowd: Traitor!

724
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:23,059
<i>Stop!</i>

725
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:28,463
Stop him, stop!

726
